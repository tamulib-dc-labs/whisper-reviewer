00:02.309 --> 00:32.130
From this valley they tell me you're leaving I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile For you take with you all of the sunshine That has lightened my path for a while Do you think of the homes you are leaving

00:32.937 --> 00:38.603
Of the parents so kind and so true?

00:38.623 --> 00:43.089
Do you think of the fond archery breaking?

00:44.250 --> 00:49.656
Of the girl who has loved you so too?

00:49.676 --> 00:54.341
Just come sit there a while ere you leave me.

00:55.102 --> 00:58.506
Do not hasten to bid me adieu.

01:00.511 --> 01:16.039
Just remember the bright German violin And the girl who has loved you so too For a long time I've waited, my darling

01:16.694 --> 01:43.242
For the sweet word you never would say And at last my fond heart now is breaking For they tell me you're going away When you go from the seams of this valley And they tell me your journey is through

01:43.677 --> 02:10.123
Just remember the bright Sherman Valley And the girl who has loved you so true Just consider what ere you leave me Do not hasten to bid me adieu Just remember the bright Sherman Valley

02:10.238 --> 02:15.017
And a girl who has loved you so too.
