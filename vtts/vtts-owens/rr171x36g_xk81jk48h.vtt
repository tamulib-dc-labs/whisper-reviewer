00:02.309 --> 00:14.130
From this valley they tell me you're leaving. I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile, 

00:14.130 --> 00:32.937
For you take with you all of the sunshine That has lightened my path for a while. Do you think of the home you are leaving

00:32.937 --> 00:38.603
Of the parents so kind and so true?

00:38.623 --> 00:43.089
Do you think of the fond heart your breaking?

00:44.250 --> 00:49.656
Of the girl who has loved you so too?

00:49.676 --> 00:54.341
Just come sit there a while ere you leave me.

00:55.102 --> 00:58.506
Do not hasten to bid me adieu.

01:00.511 --> 01:10.039
Just remember the bright Sherman valley And the girl who has loved you so true. 

01:10.039 --> 01:16.694
For a long time I've waited, my darling

01:16.694 --> 01:32.242
For the sweet word you never would say. And at last my fond heart now is breaking For they tell me you're going away. 

01:32.242 --> 01:43.677
When you go from the scenes of this valley And they tell me your journey is through

01:43.677 --> 01:53.000
Just remember the bright Sherman Valley And the girl who has loved you so true. 

01:53.000 --> 02:10.238
Just consider what ere you leave me. Do not hasten to bid me adieu. Just remember the bright Sherman Valley

02:10.238 --> 02:15.017
And a girl who has loved you so true.
