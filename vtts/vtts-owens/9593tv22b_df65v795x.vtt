The Old Maid.

00:05.556 --> 00:12.045
I'll take my stool and sit in the shade, for I'm determined to be an old maid.

00:12.706 --> 00:15.249
I'll not marry at all, at all.

00:15.970 --> 00:17.793
I'll not marry at all.

00:18.574 --> 00:24.422
I would not marry a preacher, for he'd have holes in the knees of his breeches.

I'll not marry at all.

00:27.787 --> 00:29.970
I'll not marry at all.

00:29.950 --> 00:37.024
I would not marry a man that is tall, for he'd go bumping against the wall.

00:37.785 --> 00:45.681
At all, at all, at all, I would not marry a man that is small, for he'd be the same as no man at all.

00:46.583 --> 00:51.452
I'll not marry at all, at all, I'll not marry at all.
