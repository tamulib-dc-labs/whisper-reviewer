00:00.000 --> 00:12.333
Give me a home where the buffalo roam, where the deer and the antelope play.

00:12.333 --> 00:17.942
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word.

00:18.263 --> 00:22.690
The skies are not cloudy all day.

00:23.511 --> 00:27.758
My home, my home on the range.

00:29.301 --> 00:34.189
Where the deer and the antelope play.

00:34.930 --> 00:38.796
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.

00:43.535 --> 00:57.972
How often at night, where the heavens are bright, the light of the glittering stars.

00:57.992 --> 01:04.800
I'm stood there amazed, I ask as I gaze, if the glory exceed that of ours.

01:04.800 --> 01:13.336
My home, my home on the range.

01:13.336 --> 01:16.984
Where the deer and the antelope play. 

01:16.984 --> 01:30.000
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.
