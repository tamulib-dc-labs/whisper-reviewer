00:02.782 --> 00:05.245
The Congo by Vachel Lindsay.

00:05.265 --> 00:07.649
Fat black bucks in a wine barrel room.

00:08.129 --> 00:10.352
Barrelhouse kings with feet unstable.

00:10.913 --> 00:13.577
Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.518
Pounded on the table.

00:15.239 --> 00:17.121
Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom.

00:17.662 --> 00:18.603
Hard as they were able.

00:19.164 --> 00:22.829
Boom, boom, boom with a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom.

00:23.430 --> 00:25.973
Boom, lay, boom, lay, boom, lay, boom.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.498
Then I saw the Congo creeping through the black.

00:29.933 --> 00:42.755
feeding through the jungle for the golden track, and along the riverbank a thousand miles, tattooed cannibals danced in files, 
and blood screamed the whistles and fifes of the warriors, and blood screamed the skull-faced lean witch doctors.

00:43.215 --> 00:47.743
Whirl you the deadly voodoo rattle, harry the uplands, steal all the cattle.

00:47.763 --> 00:53.713
Rattle, rattle, rattle, rattle, rattle, bing, boom-lay, boom-lay, boom-lay, boom.
