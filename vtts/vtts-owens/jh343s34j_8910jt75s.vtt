Love is a rider, while Broncos he breaks, but he's promised to quit it now just for my sake.

00:17.854 --> 00:27.675
He ties up one foot and his saddle puts on, with a swing and a jump he is mounted and gone.

00:28.550 --> 00:57.730
The first time that I saw him was early one spring He was riding a bronco, a high-headed thing He tipped me a wink as he gaily did go For he wished me to look at his fucking bronco The time that I saw him was late in the fall He was swinging the gals at the Tom Linson Ball

00:58.317 --> 01:02.023
He laughed and he talked as we danced to and fro.

01:02.244 --> 01:07.152
He said he'd quit riding his fucking Bronco.

01:09.836 --> 01:13.382
My love has a gun and that gun he can use.

01:13.602 --> 01:18.571
But he's quit his gunfighting as well as his boots.

01:19.392 --> 01:23.118
He's sold his old saddle, his spurs and his rope.

01:23.138 --> 01:24.240
And he's quit his...

01:30.582 --> 01:39.541
He said he would marry if he stayed out of jail, but when it was springtime he went up the trail.

01:39.561 --> 01:49.823
He said he would marry, but he kissed me goodbye and went up the trail with the half-circle wife.

01:53.144 --> 02:01.740
Now all you young maidens, where'er you reside, beware of the cowboy who swings the rawhide.

02:03.564 --> 02:10.697
He'll court you and pet you and leave you and go in the spring up the trail on his fucking bronco.
