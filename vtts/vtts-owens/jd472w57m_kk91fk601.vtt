00:02.748 --> 00:28.924
Glory, glory, hallelujah When I lay my burdens down Glory, glory, hallelujah When I lay my burdens down I'm gonna walk and talk with Jesus

00:28.904 --> 00:53.730
Where I lay my burden down I'm gonna walk and talk with Jesus Where I lay my burden down I'm going home to live with Jesus Where I lay my burden down

00:54.065 --> 00:58.988
I'm going home to Luba, Jesus.

00:59.008 --> 01:02.725
We lay my burden down.
