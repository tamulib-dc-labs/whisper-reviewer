Little fish played by Edgar Lynn.

00:28.533 --> 00:57.713
Oh, I wish I was a little fish I would dive to the bottom of the sea And I dive and I dive to my true love gate And I would not dive anymore Oh, I can't stay here by myself Oh, I can't stay here

01:47.913 --> 02:16.249
Through love's gates and I would not fly anymore Oh, I can't stay here by myself Oh, I can't stay here by myself Oh, I sit and I'll sing my sad little song And nobody cares for me

02:16.972 --> 02:32.668
Let's go.
