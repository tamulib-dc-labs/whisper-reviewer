00:28.533 --> 00:57.713
Oh, I wish I was a little fish I would dive to the bottom of the sea And I'd dive and I'd dive to my true love's gate And I would not dive anymore. Oh, I can't stay here by myself Oh, I can't stay here by myself.

00:57.713 --> 01:10.000
Oh I'd sit and I'd sing my sad little song And nobody cares for me.

01:10.000 --> 01:47.913
[Music.]

01:33.913 --> 02:16.249
Oh I wish I was a lonely duck. I would fly to the top of a tree. And I'd fly, and I'd fly, Through my true love's gates and I would not fly anymore. Oh, I can't stay here by myself. 
Oh, I can't stay here by myself. Oh, I'd sit and I'd sing my sad little song And nobody cares for me.
