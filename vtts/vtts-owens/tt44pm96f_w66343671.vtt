The Farmer's Cursed Wife.

00:05.684 --> 00:08.628
There was an old man who owned a farm.

00:08.888 --> 00:11.451
Hi, hi, diddle-um-day.

00:11.912 --> 00:17.539
There was an old man who owned a farm, and he had no cattle to carry it on.

00:17.559 --> 00:21.284
Singing twice, fi-dum, fi-diddle, fi-dum, fi-day.

00:21.905 --> 00:25.009
He yoked two pigs in order to plow.

00:25.073 --> 00:27.919
Hi, hi, diddle-um-day.

00:28.359 --> 00:31.005
He yoked two pigs in order to plow.

00:31.405 --> 00:34.311
And if he did it, the devil knows how.

00:34.331 --> 00:38.038
Singing twice, fi-dum, fi-diddle, fi-dum, fi-day.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.445
The devil came to him in the field one day.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.144
Hi, hi, diddle-um-day.

00:44.684 --> 00:47.188
The devil came to him in the field one day.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.892
Said, one of your family I will carry away.

00:50.452 --> 00:54.057
Singing twice, fi dum, fi diddle, fi dum, fi day.

00:54.899 --> 00:57.402
You can't have my oldest son.

00:57.782 --> 01:00.326
Hi, hi, diddle-um-day.

01:00.967 --> 01:03.410
You can't have my oldest son.

01:03.470 --> 01:06.655
For the work of the farm must still go on.

01:06.675 --> 01:10.420
Singing twice, fi dum, fi diddle, fi dum, fi day.

01:11.530 --> 01:17.397
You can have my scolding wife, hi, hi, diddle-um-day.

01:17.437 --> 01:23.484
You can have my scolding wife, but you can't keep her to save your life.

01:23.845 --> 01:27.629
Singing twice, fi dum, fi diddle, fi dum, fi day.

01:28.210 --> 01:34.197
The devil packed her up in a sack, hi, hi, diddle-um-day.

01:34.565 --> 02:03.087
The devil packed her up in a sack and like a peddler went packing, singing twice fi dum fi diddle fi dum fi day. Six little devils are climbing the wall, hi hi diddle um day. Six little devils are climbing the wall saying her back pap before she kills us all singing twice fi dum fi diddle fi dum fi day. Six little devils are dragging their chains. 

02:03.134 --> 02:05.837
Hi, hi, diddle-um-day.

02:06.357 --> 02:08.799
Six little devils are dragging their chains.

02:08.839 --> 02:11.502
Sing, take her back, pappy, for she beats out our brains.

02:11.822 --> 02:15.406
Singing twice, fi-dom, fi-diddle, fi-dom, fi-day.

02:16.427 --> 02:19.329
He packed her up in a sack.

02:19.349 --> 02:21.792
Hi, hi, diddle-um-day.

02:22.232 --> 02:24.695
He packed her up in a sack.

02:24.995 --> 02:27.517
And like a damn fool went carrying her back.

02:27.838 --> 02:31.521
Singing twice, fi-dom, fi-diddle, fi-dom, fi-day.

02:31.957 --> 02:34.621
The old man went whistling across the hill.

02:35.002 --> 02:37.546
Hi, hi, diddle-um-day.

02:38.007 --> 02:40.451
The old man went whistling across the hill.

02:40.471 --> 02:43.035
Sing, the devil won't have her, I'll be damned if I will.

02:43.295 --> 02:47.502
Sing twice, fi dum, fi diddle, fi dum, fi day.
