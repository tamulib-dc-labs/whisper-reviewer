00:01.887 --> 00:17.415
They're the one.

00:28.347 --> 00:36.878
You can hear it almost every place you go.

00:38.560 --> 00:49.454
But the static in the air makes it sometimes hard to hear.

00:50.396 --> 00:56.143
But it is not so with heaven.

01:02.350 --> 01:21.270
On the other shore Where my precious Savior listens in

01:23.275 --> 01:40.795
There's no static in the air And it never needs repair Cause my precious saviour

01:41.062 --> 02:10.090
When your burdens bring you down Almost level with the crown Broadcast unto Jesus He's listening in

02:10.441 --> 02:35.672
He will give you courage new And will lead you safely through But my precious Saviour listens in

02:35.888 --> 02:47.310
Heaven's radio on the other shore.

02:47.330 --> 02:54.724
Well, my precious Savior, listen to this.
