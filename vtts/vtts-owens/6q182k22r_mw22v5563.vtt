00:01.887 --> 00:28.347
There's a wonderful invention. It is called the radio.

00:28.347 --> 00:36.878
You can hear it almost every place you go.

00:38.560 --> 00:49.454
But the static in the air makes it sometimes hard to hear.

00:50.396 --> 00:56.143
But it is not so with heaven's radio.

01:02.350 --> 01:21.270
Heaven's radio, On the other shore, Where my precious Savior listens in.

01:23.275 --> 01:40.795
There's no static in the air And it never needs repair Cause my precious Savior listens in.

01:41.062 --> 02:10.090
When your burdens bring you down Almost level with the crown, Broadcast unto Jesus. He's listening in.

02:10.441 --> 02:35.672
He will give you courage new And will lead you safely through, But my precious Savior listens in.

02:35.888 --> 02:47.310
Heaven's radio on the other shore.

02:47.330 --> 02:54.724
Well, my precious Savior, listens in.
