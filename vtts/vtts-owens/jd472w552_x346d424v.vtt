The Jealous Lover, Opal Patton, Leesville, Texas, March the 4th, 1939.

00:13.251 --> 00:27.996
Down in a lonely valley where the violets gently bloom, Florella lies forgotten in a cold and silent tomb.

00:27.996 --> 00:46.000
She died not broken-hearted, nor of sickness did she pass. But in one moment parted from the ones she loved so dear.

00:46.000 --> 01:03.302
One night as the moon shone brightly and lightly fell the dew, to the lonely cottage, her jealous lover drew.

01:03.302 --> 01:20.000
Florella, let us wander down the meadow gay. There let us sit and ponder upon our wedding day.

01:20.000 --> 01:36.441
The way was cold and dreary The night was coming on. Into that lonely valley He led the maiden on.

01:36.441 --> 01:54.368
Oh Edward, I'm so tired, wandering here so long. The night is cold and dreary. I pray you take me home.

01:54.989 --> 02:02.840
You have not the wings of an angel, nor from me can you fly.

02:03.361 --> 02:09.550
You cannot now escape me, Florella, you must die.

02:09.550 --> 02:27.810
Then down on her knee she bended, and begged him for her life. But into a snowy white bosom he plunged a gleaming knife.

02:28.492 --> 02:35.603
Oh, Edward, I forgive you with all my dying breath.

02:36.585 --> 02:44.278
I never have deceived you as I close my eyes in death.
