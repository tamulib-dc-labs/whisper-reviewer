Roy Bean, sung by Brownie MacNeil, December 2nd, 1939.

00:11.055 --> 00:15.139
Cowboys come and hear the story of Roy Bean in all his glory.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.664
All the lowest of the Pecos was his sign.

00:19.724 --> 00:30.156
We must let our ponies take us to a town in Lower Pecos, where the high bridge bends the canyon thin and fine.

00:32.617 --> 00:40.524
He was born one day near Toya where he learned to be a lawyer and a teacher and a barber and a mayor.

00:42.666 --> 00:51.173
He was cook and old shoe mender, sometimes preacher and bartender and it cost two bits to have him cut your hair.

00:53.114 --> 01:01.982
He was right smart of a hustler and considerable a rustler and at mixing up an eggnog he was grand.

01:02.755 --> 01:12.425
He was clever, he was merry He could drink a tom and jerry On occasion that a round-up took a hand. 

01:12.425 --> 01:35.358
Though the story isn't funny There was once he had no money Which was for him not so very strange or rare. So he went to help Pap winded But he got so absent-minded That he put his RV brand on old Pap's dear.

01:35.358 --> 01:42.428
Old Pep was right smart, angry, so Roy Bean went down to Langtree where he opened up an office and a store.

01:44.311 --> 01:52.563
There he'd say, you drink our buttons or another rancher's buttons, though the latter made the other fellers sore.

01:55.408 --> 02:03.880
Once there came from Austin City a young dude reported witty who out of Bean he sort of guessed he'd take a rise.

02:05.885 --> 02:13.674
And he got unusual frisky as he ups and calls for whiskey, saying, Bean, now hurry up, I'll earn your eyes.

02:16.437 --> 02:24.586
Then the down he throws ten dollars, which this same Roy quickly collars, and for change he holds to nine and hands back one.

02:27.029 --> 02:35.098
So the stranger give a holler as he saw that single dollar, and at that began the merriment and fun.

02:37.306 --> 02:41.273
The dude, he slammed the table just as hard as he was able.

02:41.293 --> 02:44.620
That the price of whiskey was too high, he swore.

02:44.680 --> 02:54.117
Said, Roy Bean, for all that fussing and your most outrageous cussing, you are fined the other dollar by the law.
