00:24.550 --> 00:28.574
Cause I hate them dearly to no one twice as well.

00:28.975 --> 00:34.040
Fall in love, fall in late, fall in love, fall in late.

00:35.001 --> 00:46.433
She went to the doctor to do what she could find, to do what she could find, complain to make the old man go blind.

00:46.453 --> 00:51.739
Fall in love, fall in late, fall in love, fall in late.

00:52.107 --> 01:02.125
The doctor, they told her to get tomorrow bone, and they can check them all, and he couldn't see her at all.

01:02.526 --> 01:07.855
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love.

Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love.

Ball-a-law, ball-a-lay, ball-a-law, ball-a-lay.

01:41.129 --> 02:10.073
She steps back to close the old man She always steps, steps to one side And let her tumble in Foley lay, Foley lay, Foley lay, Foley lay She first began to kick and then began to bowl Tell no kind and loving wife I can't see you at all Foley lay, Foley lay, Foley lay, Foley lay
