The Butcher's Boy, an old British ballad, sung by May Kennedy McCord, June the 5th, 1939.

00:12.587 --> 00:22.541
In London City, where I did dwell, lived a butcher's boy that I loved so well, 

00:22.600 --> 00:32.541
He courted me my heart away, and now with me he will not stay.

00:32.541 --> 00:42.970
There is a house in London town where my true love goes and he dares sits down. 

00:42.970 --> 00:54.000
He takes a strange girl on his knee and he tells to her what he won't tell me. 

00:54.000 --> 01:04.895
Oh mother mother I'll tell you why. It's because she has more gold than I.

01:04.895 --> 01:18.263
But her gold will melt and her silver fly And she will be as poor as I.

01:18.263 --> 01:28.564
Her father come home from the far off town, saying, where, oh, where is my daughter gone?

01:29.846 --> 01:34.716
Saying, where, oh, where is my pride and joy?

01:34.756 --> 01:37.622
Oh, has she gone

01:37.822 --> 01:40.906
with the butcher's boy?

01:40.926 --> 01:51.359
He went upstairs, the door he broke, and found her hanging by a rope.

01:52.220 --> 02:02.673
He took a knife and cut her down, and on her bosom, these lines he found.

02:03.935 --> 02:06.698
Go dig my grave,

02:07.032 --> 02:22.071
Both wide and deep Place a marble stone At my head and feet And on my breast Place a turtledove

02:22.253 --> 02:27.601
to show to the world that I died for love.

02:27.621 --> 02:33.490
Must I go bound while he goes free?

02:33.530 --> 02:39.319
Must I love a man who don't love me?

02:39.339 --> 02:48.413
Oh, I have played a maiden's part and died for the man

02:48.882 --> 02:52.513
Who broke my heart.
