In London City, where I did dwell, lived a butcher's boy that I loved so well, he courted me.

00:30.541 --> 00:56.970
will not stay there is a house in london town where my true love goes and he there sits down he takes a strange girl on his knee and he tells to her what he won't tell me oh mother mother

00:57.608 --> 01:17.895
I'll tell you why It's because she has more gold than I But her gold will melt and her silver flies And she will be as poor as I

01:18.263 --> 01:28.564
Her father come home from the far off town, saying, where, oh, where is my daughter gone?

01:29.846 --> 01:34.716
Saying, where, oh, where is my pride and joy?

01:34.756 --> 01:37.622
Oh, has she gone?

01:37.822 --> 01:40.906
with a butcher's voice.

01:40.926 --> 01:51.359
He went upstairs, the door he broke, and found her hanging by a rope.

01:52.220 --> 02:02.673

02:03.935 --> 02:06.698

Both wide and deep Place a marble stone At my head and feet And on my breast Place a turtledove

02:22.253 --> 02:27.601
to show to the world that I died for love.

02:27.621 --> 02:33.490
Must I go bound while he goes free?

02:33.530 --> 02:39.319
Must I love a man who don't love me?

02:39.339 --> 02:48.413
Oh, I have played a maiden's part and died for the man

02:48.882 --> 02:52.513
Who broke my heart
