00:04.385 --> 00:33.767
When I can read My touch As clear To a mansion In the sky I'll bid

00:34.203 --> 01:01.763
farewell to every fear and wipe my weeping eyes should hurt

01:02.300 --> 01:30.670
He can't my soul engage and far redots be held in my hand.

01:31.375 --> 01:57.282
smile at sea and rage and peace a frowning world let's test like

01:57.565 --> 02:22.307
A wild tell you would come Let some of sorrow fall May I fall

02:23.333 --> 02:43.772
If they reach my home, my God, my heaven, my all heaven.
