00:08.215 --> 00:22.613
The dark is weak While he like others am not gay What makes the tears roll down his cheeks

00:22.846 --> 00:50.170
From early morn to a close day The story dark as you shall hear For in my memory fresh it dwells It will cause you all to drop a tear On the grave of my sweet, of my sweet kitty well

00:50.521 --> 01:17.355
While the birds were singing in the morning The myrtle and the ivy were in bloom The sun oil top was adorning It was then when later in the dew The springtime has no charm for me

01:17.791 --> 01:23.617
The flowers are blooming in the dell.

01:23.637 --> 01:27.981
It's that bright form I do not see.

01:28.922 --> 01:33.587
It's the form of my sweet kitty well.

01:34.227 --> 01:39.252
While the birds were singing in the morning.

01:39.953 --> 01:43.917
The myrtle and the ivy were in bloom.

01:44.926 --> 01:53.959
The sun oiled up while the dawning, it was then we laid her in the stew.

01:55.982 --> 02:05.736
I never shall forget today, we both together on the dell.

02:06.273 --> 02:16.352
I kissed her cheek and named the day that I would marry Kitty Wells.

02:16.973 --> 02:26.931
But death came in my cabin door and took from me my joy and pride.

02:27.974 --> 02:38.035
When I found she was no more, I laid my banjo down and cried.
