00:04.587 --> 00:17.102
In the distant lands of West, I have a mother of kindness that I treasure more than silver or gold.

00:18.684 --> 00:24.672
And the song she used to sing, happy praise and cheer would bring.

00:25.333 --> 00:30.879
And my loving mother's voice has never grown.

00:30.899 --> 00:32.181
She was faithful.

00:34.777 --> 00:41.248
loving too, and I always wept wherever I would roam.

00:42.570 --> 00:53.248
But she prayed to God today, on a pointed way, that you someday bring me safely to a home.

00:54.650 --> 01:00.480
Since I left my mother's home, since I choose a part to roam,

01:00.950 --> 01:05.776
I miss her tender care from day to day.

01:05.796 --> 01:13.807
I miss her loving voice, always made my heart rejoice.

01:13.827 --> 01:18.213
She would cheer me as I journey on my way.

01:18.433 --> 01:24.821
She was faithful, she was true, she was kind and loving too.

01:24.841 --> 01:30.028
And she always went wherever I would roam through.

01:30.835 --> 01:42.297
But she prayed to God each day, in his own appointed way, that he someday bring me safely to a home.
