00:02.495 --> 00:06.701
Way down in West Virginia lived a girl named Nancy Brown.

00:06.721 --> 00:10.486
She never seen such beauty in city or in town.

00:10.967 --> 00:18.057
Nancy and the deacon climbed the mountainside one day, but Nancy didn't like what the deacon had to say.

00:18.097 --> 00:21.702
She came rolling down the mountain, she came rolling down the mountain.

00:21.968 --> 00:24.611
rollin' down the mountain mighty soon.

00:24.631 --> 00:32.259
For fight she's deacon's urchin, she is still the local virgin, and she's just as pure as her old pappy's moon.

00:33.199 --> 00:37.003
And then there came a cowboy, a cowboy big and strong.

00:37.424 --> 00:41.188
She took our Nancy Walken, but she still knew right from wrong.

00:41.268 --> 00:48.415
She came rollin' down the mountain, she came rollin' down the mountain, rollin' down the mountain mighty still.

00:48.665 --> 01:00.562
And then there came a trapper with his knapsack on his back.

01:00.582 --> 01:04.147
He took our Nancy walkin' her way up to his shack.

01:04.207 --> 01:11.618
She came rollin' down the mountain, she came rollin' down the mountain, rollin' down the mountain mighty wise.

01:11.935 --> 01:19.466
For despite the trapper's punnin', she didn't feel like funnin', and she's just as pure as West Virginia skies.

01:20.507 --> 01:24.293
Then there came a city slicker with his hundred-dollar bills.

01:24.713 --> 01:28.539
He took the Nancy and his Chevy up those West Virginia hills.

01:28.559 --> 01:30.983
Oh, she stayed up in the mountains.

01:31.183 --> 01:33.626
Yes, she stayed up in the mountains.

01:34.327 --> 01:38.213
She stayed up in the mountains all the night.

01:38.733 --> 01:44.341
She came home next morning early, more a woman than a girly.

01:45.602 --> 01:48.346
And her pappy kicked the hussy out of sight.

01:49.047 --> 01:52.231
And she's living in the city, yes, she's living in the city.

01:52.852 --> 01:55.476
Living in the city mighty well.

01:56.096 --> 02:00.983
She's a-wining and a-dining on her fanny, she's reclining.

02:01.003 --> 02:05.449
And those West Virginia hills can go to hell.
