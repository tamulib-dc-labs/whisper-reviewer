A pretty fair maiden in my garden A jolly cowboy came riding by And said, pretty miss, oh, will you marry And said, pretty miss, will you marry me Oh, no, no, my kind young fellow How would you pose a girl like me

00:29.174 --> 00:55.840
For I have a true love among the cowboys Has been gone from me three years today Perhaps your lover he has drowned in Or perhaps he's by some Indian maid Or perhaps he's to some pretty girl married You'll never see his face again

00:56.275 --> 01:00.222
And if he's married, I hope he's happy.

01:00.984 --> 01:13.407
Or if he's by some evening, or if he's to some pretty girl married, I love the girl that married he.
