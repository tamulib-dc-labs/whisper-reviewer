00:04.925 --> 00:11.645
I'll tell you what a time I had with Davy Crockett, half horse, half coon, and half dry rocket.

00:11.665 --> 00:17.382
I met Colonel Davy going out a-coonin', says I, Davy Crockett how'd you hunt without a gun?

00:17.885 --> 00:24.113
Oh, says he, Pompey Smash, if you follow along with Davy, I'll soon show you how far to grin a coon crazy.

00:25.014 --> 00:30.701
I followed along with Davy till Davy spotted a squirrel, sitting on a pine log eating sheep sorrel.

00:31.361 --> 00:34.365
And he stopped right still, and for me began to feel.

00:35.226 --> 00:37.729
Says, Pompey Smash, let me brace against your heel.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.313
I stuck out my heel for to brace up the sinner.

00:41.994 --> 00:45.158
Old Davy began to grin a little harder for his dinner.

00:45.138 --> 00:51.195
Oh, at last, Davy said, oh, he surely must be dead, for I thought I saw the bark fall around the critter's head.

00:51.937 --> 00:57.493
We both went up for the truth to discover, the devil rose to old Pompey Smash's liver.

00:57.794 --> 01:04.992
Was a great big knot about the size of a barrel, Says I, Davy Crockett, do you call that a squirrel. 

01:04.992 --> 01:12.000
And a hyah, hyah, hyah. Oh, I tell you, black calf, Oh, I tell you, mustn't laugh If you do, I pin your ears back and bite you in half. 

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
I throw down my gun and I drop my ammunition. Says I, Davy Crockett, I'll cool your ambition.

01:19.310 --> 01:25.081
He backed both ears and he puffed like a steamer, says he, Pompey Smash, I'm a Tennessee screamer.

01:25.882 --> 01:32.554
And we both locked arms and a soft breath was gone, for I've never hugged you tight since the hour I was born.

01:32.574 --> 01:38.365
We fought a half a day and we both agreed to drop it, for I was badly whipped and so was Davy Crockett.

01:38.783 --> 01:44.493
Come to examine far ahead gosh both of them were missing for he had bit off my head and I swallowed his'n. 

01:44.500 --> 01:50.000
And we both did agree for to let each other be. For I was rather hard for him and so was he for me.
