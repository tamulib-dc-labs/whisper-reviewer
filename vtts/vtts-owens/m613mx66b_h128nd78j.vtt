00:04.925 --> 00:11.645
Well, you ought to find I had with David Crockett, half horse, half coonin', half dry rocket.

00:11.665 --> 00:17.382
I met Colonel Davy going out of coonin', so I gave you Crockett how you hunt without a gun.

00:17.885 --> 00:24.113
Oh, says E-Pomp-A-Smash, if you follow along with Davy, I'll soon show you how far to grin a coon crazy.

00:25.014 --> 00:30.701
I followed along with Davy till Davy spotted a squirrel, sitting on a pine log eating sheep's sorrel.

00:31.361 --> 00:34.365
And he stopped right still, and for me began to feel.

00:35.226 --> 00:37.729
Says E-Pomp-A-Smash, let me brace against the heel.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.313
I stuck out my heel, far to brace up the center.

00:41.994 --> 00:45.158
Old Davy began to grin a little harder for his dinner.

00:45.138 --> 00:51.195
Oh, at last, Davy said, oh, I surely must be dead, for I thought I saw the bark fall around the critter's head.

00:51.937 --> 00:57.493
We both went up for the truth to discover, the devil rose to all pompous lies his liver.

00:57.794 --> 01:18.992
Was a great big knot about the size of a barrel Says I, David Crockett, do you call that a squirrel And a hyah, hyah, hyah Oh, I tell you, black cat Oh, I tell you, mustn't laugh If you do, I pin your ears back and bite you in half I throw down my gun and I drop my ammunition Says I, David Crockett, I'll cool your ambition

01:19.310 --> 01:25.081
He backed both ears and he puffed like a steamer, says he fought for smash, I'm a Tennessee streamer.

01:25.882 --> 01:32.554
And we both locked arms and a soft breath was gone, for I've never hugged you tight since the hour I was born.

01:32.574 --> 01:38.365
We fought a half a day and we both agreed to drop it, for I was badly whipped and so was David Crockett.

01:38.783 --> 01:51.493
come to examine far ahead gosh both of them were missing for he had bit off my head and i swallowed his and we both did agree for to let each other be for i was rather hard for him and so was he for me
