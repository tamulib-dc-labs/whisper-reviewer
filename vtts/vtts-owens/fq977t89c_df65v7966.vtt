00:03.203 --> 00:07.868
This is a song entitled Diamond Joe, sometimes called The Chisholm Trail.

00:10.992 --> 00:15.036
Oh, Diamond Joe was a rich...

00:15.076 --> 00:19.361
With lots of cowboys in his pay.

00:19.401 --> 00:22.725
He rode the range with his cowboy band.

00:23.266 --> 00:26.509
And many a maverick got his brand.

00:26.710 --> 00:28.772
If I was rich,

00:28.752 --> 00:34.961
As Diamond Joe, I'd work today and I'd work no more.

00:34.981 --> 00:38.646
I work me so hard and the pay so slow.

00:38.666 --> 00:42.692
But I don't give a darn if I worked hard, no.

00:43.172 --> 00:45.596
Roll on, boys, roll.

00:45.696 --> 00:47.979
Don't you roll too slow?

00:48.039 --> 00:50.002
Roll on, boys, roll.

00:50.082 --> 00:51.604
Don't you roll too slow?

00:51.584 --> 01:00.240
Hi-oh, hi-oh, you roll like boys, never rolled before.

01:00.821 --> 01:08.395
I left my girl in a Texas shack, and I told her I wasn't coming back.

01:08.375 --> 01:15.547
But I lost that cart and I got in jail And I found myself on the Chatham Trail. 

01:15.547 --> 01:31.527
I'll stay with the herd till I reach the end, Drag my time and I'll blow it in. Just one more spree and one more jail, And I'll head back home on the Chatham Trail.

01:31.527 --> 01:35.856
Roll on, boys, roll, don't you roll so slow.

01:36.257 --> 01:42.129
Roll on, boys, roll, don't you roll so slow.

01:42.149 --> 01:48.642
Hi-oh, hi-oh, you roll like boys, never roll before.

01:48.622 --> 02:07.680
I'll stay with a herd till I fall so red at the Texas line, And I'll head back home with a girl of mine. And I'll sit in the shade and sing this song, And watch the herd go drifting home. 

02:07.680 --> 02:14.660
When the time has come to leave this world I'll say goodbye to my little girl

02:14.660 --> 02:23.421
I'll hold my hands when I have to go and say goodbye, old Diamond Joe.
