This is a song entitled Diamond Joe, sometimes called The Chiseled Trail.

00:10.992 --> 00:15.036
Oh, Diamond Joe was a rich O.J.

00:15.076 --> 00:19.361
With lots of cowboys in his pay.

00:19.401 --> 00:22.725
He rode the range with his cowboy band.

00:23.266 --> 00:26.509
And many a maverick got his brand.

00:26.710 --> 00:28.772
If I was rich,

00:28.752 --> 00:34.961
As Diamond Joe, I'd work today and I'd work no more.

00:34.981 --> 00:38.646
I'd work me so hard and I'd be so slow.

00:38.666 --> 00:42.692
But I don't give a darn if I worked hard, no.

00:43.172 --> 00:45.596
Roll on, boys, roll.

00:45.696 --> 00:47.979
Don't you roll too slow?

00:48.039 --> 00:50.002
Roll on, boys, roll.

00:50.082 --> 00:51.604
Don't you roll too slow?

00:51.584 --> 01:00.240
Hi-oh, hi-oh, you roll like boys, never rolled before.

01:00.821 --> 01:08.395
I left my girl in a textless shack, and I told her I wasn't coming back.

01:08.375 --> 01:31.547
But I lost that car and I got in jail And I found myself on the Chatham Trail I'll stay with the hurt till I reach the end Drag my time and I'll blow it in Just one more spree and one more jail And I'll head back home on the Chatham Trail

01:31.527 --> 01:35.856
Roll on, boys, roll, don't you roll so slow.

01:36.257 --> 01:42.129
Roll on, boys, roll, don't you roll so slow.

01:42.149 --> 01:48.642
In Ohio, you roll like boys, never roll before.

01:48.622 --> 02:14.680
I'll stay with a herd till I fall so red at the Texas line And I'll head back home with a girl of mine And I'll sit in the shade and sing this song And watch the herd go drifting home When the time has come to leave this world I'll say goodbye to my little girl

02:14.660 --> 02:23.421
I'll hold my hands when I have to go and say goodbye, old Diamond Joe.
