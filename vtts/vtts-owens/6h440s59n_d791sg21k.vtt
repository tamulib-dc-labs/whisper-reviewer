00:05.026 --> 00:08.450
Do they ever keep on calling?

00:10.972 --> 00:13.856
Calling through the storm and rain.

00:15.277 --> 00:17.740
Watching, praying, waiting.

00:18.701 --> 00:22.125
Tell my Savior, come again.

00:25.048 --> 00:30.874
I am waiting, Lord, trusting in thy way.

00:31.595 --> 00:34.358
Keep me from the past of sin.

00:35.890 --> 00:43.181
Hide me in the blood, write my name above.

00:44.362 --> 00:50.932
When that gate sprang open, let me in.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.978
Pray keeps me feeling the service.

00:56.199 --> 00:59.123
It helps me on every hand.

01:00.365 --> 01:03.670
I've had many a triumph.

01:04.308 --> 01:07.591
Someday I'll understand.

01:10.373 --> 01:16.098
I am coming, Lord, trust in her in thy ways.

01:16.779 --> 01:19.781
Keep me from the past of sin.

01:22.364 --> 01:28.269
I'll be in the blood and write my name above.

01:28.289 --> 01:33.133
But when that gate swings open,

01:33.232 --> 01:35.916
Let me in.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.961
Teach me how to love my neighbor.

01:41.223 --> 01:44.047
Teach me how to treat my friends.

01:45.249 --> 01:49.054
Fill me with the Holy Spirit.

01:49.074 --> 01:52.139
Keep me humble to the end.

01:53.661 --> 01:55.724
I'm the Lord.

01:56.184 --> 01:59.649
I'm crushed in thy way.

02:00.230 --> 02:03.154
Just keep me from the past of sin.

02:04.079 --> 02:11.647
Hide me in the blood and write my name above.

02:12.488 --> 02:18.914
When that gate swing open, let me in.

02:20.115 --> 02:24.059
I'm tired of this load of carrying.

02:24.079 --> 02:27.183
I'm tired of this sinful world.

02:28.043 --> 02:31.487
The angels in the kingdom begging.

02:31.855 --> 02:49.631
I'm coming, Lord, trusting in thy way to keep me from the past of them.

02:49.651 --> 02:51.855
I'm in the blood.
