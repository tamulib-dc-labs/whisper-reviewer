Deary life, it robs poor girls of a harsh delight Causes them to weep and mourn The loss of a true love never to return Oh, brown be the color on the true love's hair It's equals like some lily fair If every returns it'll bring me joy For none can I love but my sweet sailor boy

00:30.507 --> 00:36.236
She met three ships all come from Spain, all was heavy loaded as they could swim.

00:36.637 --> 00:42.387
She hailed each captain as they passed by, and there she inquired for her sweet sailor boy.

00:42.927 --> 00:48.537
Captain, captain, tell me true, does sweet Willy sail with you?

00:49.198 --> 00:54.827
No, no, he's not here, he got drowned in the guff, my dear.

00:55.162 --> 01:07.973
She rang her hands and she tore her hair Like someone in deep despair If ever he returns it'll bring me joy For none can I love but my sweet sailor boy
