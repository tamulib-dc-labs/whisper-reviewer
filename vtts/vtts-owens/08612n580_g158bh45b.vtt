Sailor's trade is a dreary life, it robs poor girls of a harsh delight, Causes them to weep and mourn The loss of a true love never to return. 
Oh, brown be the color on my true love's hair His cheeks are like some lily fair. If he returns it'll bring me joy For none can I love but my sweet sailor boy.

She met three ships all come from Spain, all was heavy loaded as they could swim.

00:36.637 --> 00:42.387
She hailed each captain as they passed by, and there she inquired for her sweet sailor boy.

00:42.927 --> 00:48.537
Captain, captain, tell me true, does sweet Willy sail with you?

00:49.198 --> 00:54.827
No, no, he's not here, he got drowned in the gulf, my dear.

00:55.162 --> 01:07.973
She rang her hands and she tore her hair Like someone in deep despair. If ever he returns it'll bring me joy For none can I love but my sweet sailor boy.
