Barbara, sung by May Kennedy McCord, Springfield, 3rd June the 5th, 1939.

00:10.454 --> 00:24.912
In Scoratown where I was born, there was a fair made dwelling, made every youth cry wail away.

00:24.932 --> 00:29.397
Oh, here comes Father Ellen.

00:29.883 --> 00:47.622
T'was in the merry months of May The green buds were a-swealin' Sweet William on his death that he lay For the love of Bonnie and Ellen

00:47.905 --> 01:16.714
They sent a servant to the town Where Barbara was a-dwelling Saying, rise, oh rise, you up and go If your name be Barbara Ellen So slowly, slowly she rose up And slowly she come nigh

01:16.913 --> 01:26.284
And every word she said to him was, young man, I think you're dying.

01:27.586 --> 01:37.318
Oh, yes, I'm sick and very sick, and death is on me dwelling.

01:37.535 --> 01:47.188
And one sweet kiss would comfort me from the lips of Barbara Ellen.

01:47.909 --> 01:57.221
Oh, yes, you're sick and very sick, and death is on you dwelling.

01:57.241 --> 02:06.613
But one sweet kiss you never will have from the lips of Barbara Ellen.

02:06.796 --> 02:15.971
Oh, don't you remember on a wedding night when we were at the tavern?

02:15.991 --> 02:25.227
You drank a help to the ladies around, but you slighted Barbara Ellen.

02:25.578 --> 02:34.659
Oh, yes, I remember on a wedding night when we were at the tavern.

02:34.679 --> 02:44.481
I drank a help to the ladies around, but I loved sweet Mother Ellen.
