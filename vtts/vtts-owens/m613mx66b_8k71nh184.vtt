00:03.811 --> 00:08.000 
Pompey Smash and Davy Crockett, by Lemuel Jeffus. 

00:08.000 --> 00:12.984
I hark from old Virginia where you see all the great men.

00:13.545 --> 00:17.430
I am Pompey Smash, one of the principal statemen.

00:18.191 --> 00:22.037
I am second best to none by the sight of the sun.

00:22.557 --> 00:25.802
And by the Lord, my head it weighs a half a ton.

00:26.542 --> 00:30.647
I'll sing to the folks what I think it am concerning.

00:31.227 --> 00:34.771
I'll give you a little touch of the old Virginia learning.

00:35.392 --> 00:39.537
The Yankees say tote and fotch, 'stead of bring and carry.

00:39.977 --> 00:43.301
The way to talk grammar by the Lord Harry.

00:44.202 --> 00:47.086
There's a nigger that they call Jim Crow.

00:47.166 --> 00:49.028
He's a very learned scholar.

00:49.689 --> 00:52.752
Tell you more lies than ever you could swallow.

00:53.103 --> 00:56.788
Says that the earth world is bigger than the ocean.

00:57.188 --> 01:00.893
Fashagrab's what keeps the world in motion.

01:00.913 --> 01:08.864
Oh, but that is not a fact, for I'll tell you all exact about the sun and the moon in the twinking of a crack.

01:08.884 --> 01:11.928
The world's made of mud out of the Mississippi River.

01:12.068 --> 01:14.931
The sun's a ball of foxfire as you all discover.

01:15.472 --> 01:18.436
The moon's made of cheese, alas it keeps a-flying.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.540
The sun stands still and the world keeps a-gwine.

01:22.010 --> 01:28.798
All the stars in ladies' eyes all around the world they rise for to give a little light when the moon don't shine.

01:30.420 --> 01:33.183
Old Zip Coon is what the folks call him.

01:33.263 --> 01:42.234
If I ever catch him, I intend for to maul him. Over such an accuracy, he takes a lot of liberty for to go about the streets and scandalize me.

01:43.215 --> 01:51.325
He said I was a fool and didn't know a letter, but the folks that know me know a great deal better. over such an accuracy.

01:52.030 --> 01:53.895
Can't discern true knowledge.

01:53.955 --> 01:56.682
How in the world could he when he'd never been to college?

01:56.702 --> 01:59.930
Nor neither have I, but I came very nigh.

01:59.950 --> 02:03.238
For I caught a sight of college once as I passed by.
