He was standing by her window, as the breezes kissed her cheek. 

00:17.747 --> 00:28.213
He had waited long in silence, Waited long for her to speak. 

00:28.213 --> 00:40.582
Then at last she gave an answer As she raised her tear-filled eyes.

00:40.582 --> 00:50.000 01:08.125
With such a look of anger That it filled him with surprise. 

00:50.000 --> 01:01.000
They tell me that you love another And that you never did love me. 

01:01.000 --> 01:12.125
If these words be true, my darling, I'll forever set you free.

01:12.408 --> 01:23.505
They are true my dear, he answered, to as shining stars above, 

01:23.505 --> 01:33.991
When they told of my engagement, There they told you of my love.

01:33.991 --> 01:43.000
Goodbye, darling, I must leave you On the streets just pass me by. 

01:43.000 --> 01:54.000 
Don't forget that I still love you For to save my life I die. 

02:00.268 --> 02:04.000
God in heaven sent an angel to relieve her dreadful pain

02:04.637 --> 02:14.277
Then she drifted on to heaven On an angel's snow-white wing. 

02:14.277 --> 02:25.612
She was standing by her casket As he gazed into her face

02:25.612 --> 02:35.588
Then he realized that he loved her. No one else could take her place.
