As the breezes kissed her teeth He had waited long his own Waited long for her to see Then at last she gave an answer As she raised her near field eyes

00:40.582 --> 01:08.125
With such a look of anger That it filled him with suffrage They tell me that you love another And that you never did love me If these words be true, my darling

01:08.408 --> 01:33.505
Thou forever set you free They are to my dear the answer To add the shining stars above When they told you I'm an engine There they told you of my love

01:33.991 --> 02:00.268
Goodbye, darling, I must leave you On the streets just pass me by Don't forget that I still love you For to save my life I die God in heaven sent an angel

02:00.637 --> 02:25.277
To relieve her dreadful flame Then she drifted on to heaven On an angel's snow-white ring She was standing by her casket As he gazed into her face

02:25.612 --> 02:35.588
Then he realized that he loved her No one else could take her away
