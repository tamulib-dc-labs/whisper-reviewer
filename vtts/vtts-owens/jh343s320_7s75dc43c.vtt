Come on, Jack, by Daniel Jeffs, a little bit of text.

00:07.212 --> 00:11.727
Dear sweet heart, wait for you, Jack.

00:11.747 --> 00:14.175
Dear sweet heart, wait for you.

00:30.912 --> 00:43.410
At the close of day, someone says sing a song, Jack will drive all cares away.

00:44.431 --> 00:53.364
When Jack began his singing, his mind wandered back.

00:53.384 --> 00:59.232
He was singing of a maiden who was waiting.

01:02.975 --> 01:11.767
He left the camp next morning, reading his sweetheart's name.

01:11.787 --> 01:20.218
Said I'll go and ask forgiveness, for I know that I'm to blame.

01:21.620 --> 01:30.231
But when he reached the prairie, he found a new-made mound.

01:30.616 --> 01:40.491
and his friend they sadly told him they had laid his loved one down they say

01:48.875 --> 01:56.807
It'll go and ask forgiveness, for I know that I'm to blame.

01:57.908 --> 02:01.854
Your sweetheart waits for you, Jack.

02:03.276 --> 02:05.339
Your sweetheart waits for you.

02:07.142 --> 02:14.713
Out on the lonely prairie, where the skies are always bleak.
