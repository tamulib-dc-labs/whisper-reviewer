Three German officers crossed the Rhine.

00:20.382 --> 00:23.787
At last they came to a wayside in.

00:24.608 --> 00:34.102

00:47.129 --> 00:51.196
Oh, landlord, have you a daughter fair with lily white teeth and golden hair?

00:51.236 --> 00:55.043
Yo-ho, you buggers, yo-ho, you buggers, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho.

00:56.104 --> 00:59.891
Oh, yes, I have a daughter fair, yo-ho, yo-ho.

01:04.699 --> 01:10.369
Oh, yes, I have a daughter fair with lily white teeth and golden hair, yo-ho, you buggers, yo-ho, yo-ho.

01:13.201 --> 01:17.068
Oh, Landlord, lend us your daughter fair, ya ho, ya ho.

01:17.589 --> 01:21.356
Oh, Landlord, lend us your daughter fair, ya ho, ya ho.

01:21.877 --> 01:26.045
Oh, Landlord, lend us your daughter fair, for we're the answer to a maiden's prayer.

01:26.085 --> 01:30.754
Ya ho, ya buggers, ya ho, ya buggers, ya ho, ya ho, ya ho.

01:30.734 --> 01:48.422
My daughter fair is much too young to be buggered about by your sons of guns.

01:48.773 --> 01:52.761
Oh, Father dear, I'm not too young, yo-ho, yo-ho.

01:53.262 --> 01:56.969
Oh, Father dear, I'm not too young, yo-ho, yo-ho.

01:57.470 --> 02:06.647
Oh, Father dear, I'm not too young, I've been buggered about by the parson's son, yo-ho, you bugger, yo-ho, you bugger, ho, ho, ho.
