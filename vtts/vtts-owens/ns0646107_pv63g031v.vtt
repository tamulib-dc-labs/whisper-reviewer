by Brownie McNeill.

00:07.819 --> 00:16.000
Twas in the town of Jacksboro in the spring of 73. A man by the name of Crego can stepping up to me.

00:16.000 --> 00:25.799 
Saying, how do you do, young fellow? How would you like to go and spend one summer pleasantly on the range of the buffalo.

00:25.799 --> 00:34.153
And me not having any job to Crego, I did say, this job of hunting buffalo depends upon the pay.

00:34.374 --> 00:43.369
But if you pay good wages and transportation too, I think, sir, I will go with you on the range of the buffalo.

00:43.349 --> 00:52.285
Yes, I will pay good wages and transportation too, provided you will go with me and stay the summer through.

00:52.546 --> 00:56.272
But if you should be homesick, come back to Jacksboro.

00:56.613 --> 01:02.303
I'll not pay transportation from the range of the buffalo.

01:03.059 --> 01:06.847
It's now our outfit is complete, seven able-bodied men.

01:07.208 --> 01:10.896
With navy sticks and needle gun, our troubles did begin.

01:11.217 --> 01:14.965
While skinning the damned old sneakers, our lives they had no show.

01:15.285 --> 01:19.735
For the Indians waited to pick us off on the hills of Mexico.

01:21.217 --> 01:25.103
Now the season being near over, old Crego, he did say.

01:25.464 --> 01:29.270
The crowd had been extravagant, was in debt to him that day.

01:29.610 --> 01:33.477
We coaxed him and we begged him, but still it was no go.

01:33.657 --> 01:38.685
So he left old Crego's bones to bleach on the range of the buffalo.

01:39.678 --> 01:43.527
It's now we've crossed Peace River and homeward we are found.

01:43.848 --> 01:47.617
No more in that hillside country will ever we be found.

01:47.937 --> 01:51.706
Go home to our wives and sweethearts, tell others not to go.

01:52.027 --> 01:57.079
For God's forsaken the buffalo range, and the damned old buffalo.
