501, Sacred Heart.

00:03.234 --> 00:58.072
[Singing.]

00:58.688 --> 01:07.523
Now there is a land where the young shall stand, and Jesus, the Savior, is there. 

01:07.523 --> 01:25.705
He has come to prepare to the home of life. Oh, I long, oh, I long to be there. In the view is the land

01:25.705 --> 01:45.148
Where the angels said, We shall meet, we shall meet. We shall meet, we shall meet in that beautiful land.

01:45.280 --> 01:55.935
I don't swing to the throne to the kingdom that they are free from the sorrow I get.

01:56.676 --> 02:03.326
And I just shine to me till the clouds are stacked.

02:03.626 --> 02:07.011
Oh, I long, oh, I long to be there.

02:07.712 --> 02:14.562
In that beautiful land, where the angels stand.

02:15.672 --> 02:22.097
We come in. We come in. We come in. 

02:22.497 --> 02:30.000
We come in to that beautiful land.
