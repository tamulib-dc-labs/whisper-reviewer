00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Couldn't hear nobody pray. Couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:11.000 --> 00:19.000
Way down yonder by myself, couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
In the valley, couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:25.529 --> 00:29.681
On my knees, couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:30.744 --> 00:36.079
With my burden, couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:36.099 --> 00:40.601
And my Savior, couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:40.601 --> 00:49.000
Oh Lord, Couldn't hear nobody pray. Couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:49.000 --> 00:58.00
Way down yonder by myself, couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
Hallelujah, couldn't hear nobody pray.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Troubles over, couldn't hear nobody pray.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
In the kingdom, couldn't hear nobody pray.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
With my Savior, couldn't hear nobody pray.

01:18.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh Lord, Couldn't hear nobody pray. Couldn't hear nobody pray.

01:30.532 --> 01:37.470
Way down yonder by myself, couldn't hear nobody pray.
