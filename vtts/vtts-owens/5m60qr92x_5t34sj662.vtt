00:01.415 --> 00:10.226
I was born in Boston City, a place you all know well.

00:10.246 --> 00:15.453
Brought up by honest parents, a truth to you I'll tell.

00:16.034 --> 00:21.802
Yes, brought up by honest parents and raised most tenderly.

00:22.462 --> 00:28.350
Till I became a 14 man at the age of 23.

00:28.786 --> 00:34.774
And then my cash was taken, and I was sent to jail.

00:34.794 --> 00:40.482
My parents tried to bail me out, but it was of no avail.

00:41.123 --> 00:43.827
The juryman found me guilty.

00:44.047 --> 00:46.410
The clerk, he wrote it down.

00:47.011 --> 00:52.278
The judge pronounced my sentence to go to share it down.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.603
I saw my aged parents.

00:55.955 --> 01:01.424
I saw my aged father a-standing at the bar.

01:01.884 --> 01:06.772
Like my, my aged mother a-pulling out her hair.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.438
Yes, pulling out those old gray locks.

01:10.578 --> 01:13.062
Big tears came rolling down.

01:13.763 --> 01:16.748
Saying, my son, for hell you've done.

01:16.848 --> 01:19.532
They send you to the cherry stand.

01:20.137 --> 01:26.064
They put me on board of an eastbound train one cold December's day.

01:26.845 --> 01:38.459
And every station I pass through, I heard those people say, there goes that Boston burglar with our own chain found them.

01:39.380 --> 01:44.546
Or some crime martyrs, he sent to share his town.

01:45.247 --> 01:47.950
There's a girl in Boston City.

01:48.183 --> 02:17.346
And a girl that I love well In silver I get my little Bertie Along with her I dwell Yes, silver I get my little Bertie Bad company I shone Last wise night walking and gambling And also drinking or drinking Come all young men who have your liberty Pray peace if you can

02:17.714 --> 02:23.326
And don't go around those towns at night to break the laws of me.

02:23.927 --> 02:29.720
For if you do, you soon will do when the world will frown on you.

02:30.441 --> 02:35.993
And you'll be disturbing what number one hears in a town I can tell you.
