00:02.107 --> 00:06.713
Through the years I keep on soaring.

00:07.133 --> 00:11.939
Soaring to sun and rain.

00:12.700 --> 00:16.945
Watching and patiently waiting.

00:17.726 --> 00:21.711
Till the Savior comes again.

00:24.275 --> 00:28.620
I am waiting on, on in a time.

00:29.123 --> 00:33.047
And in the way, oh, have mercy now.

00:33.067 --> 00:37.412
Teach me from the path of sin to lordy now.

00:38.754 --> 00:42.798
Ah, ah, me and the love, oh, lordy now.

00:42.818 --> 00:47.924
Ride my name above in the morning now.

00:47.944 --> 00:54.591
When the gates swing open, lordy now.

00:54.571 --> 00:56.213
Who walk in?

00:56.333 --> 00:57.154
Who walk in?

00:57.334 --> 01:02.821
Lord, teach me how to love my neighbor.

01:03.081 --> 01:08.367
Teach me how to treat my friends.

01:08.447 --> 01:12.592
Fill me with the Holy Spirit.

01:12.632 --> 01:19.380
Make me your someone who not is and will.

01:20.052 --> 01:28.741
I am on the law, Lord, and I trust, and in the Lord, have mercy now.

01:29.162 --> 01:44.558
Keep me from the path of sin, good Lord, and I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

01:44.538 --> 01:53.052
Lookin', swing, open, Lord, and I'm walkin', walkin'.

01:53.192 --> 01:58.641
Well, I'm tired of the Lord ain't tellin'.

01:58.982 --> 02:03.930
Tired on the way to spin'.

02:03.910 --> 02:21.936
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

02:21.916 --> 02:27.245
Lord, have mercy now, keep me from the path of sin.

02:27.265 --> 02:32.393
Say, good Lord, and I hide the end of love.

02:32.413 --> 02:38.523
Oh, Lord, now write my name above in the morning.

02:38.563 --> 02:48.700
Now when the gates wait, oh, Lord, and I walk in, walk in.
