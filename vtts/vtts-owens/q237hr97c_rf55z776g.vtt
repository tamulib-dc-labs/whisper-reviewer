00:02.107 --> 00:06.713
Through the years I keep on toiling.

00:07.133 --> 00:11.939
Toiling through sun and rain.

00:12.700 --> 00:16.945
Watching and patiently waiting.

00:17.726 --> 00:21.711
Till the Savior comes again.

00:24.275 --> 00:28.620
I am waiting on, on in a time.

00:29.123 --> 00:33.047
And in the way, oh, have mercy now.

00:33.067 --> 00:37.412
Keep me from the path of sin, oh Lord, now.

00:38.754 --> 00:42.798
Hide me in your love, oh, Lord now.

00:42.818 --> 00:47.924
Write my name above, oh, Lord now.

00:47.944 --> 00:54.591
When the gates swing open, oh, Lord now.

00:54.571 --> 00:56.213
I'll walk in,

00:56.333 --> 00:57.154
I'll walk in.

00:57.334 --> 01:02.821
Lord, teach me how to love my neighbor.

01:03.081 --> 01:08.367
Teach me how to treat my friends.

01:08.447 --> 01:12.592
Fill me with the Holy Spirit.

01:12.632 --> 01:19.380
[Singing.]

01:20.052 --> 01:28.741
I am on the law, Lord, and I trust, and in the Lord, have mercy now.

01:29.162 --> 01:44.558
Keep me from the paths of sin, good Lord. Hide me in your love, oh, Lord now. Write my name above, oh, Lord now.

01:44.538 --> 01:53.052
When the gates swing open, oh, Lord now, I'll walk in, I'll walk in.

01:53.192 --> 01:58.641
Well, I'm tired...ain't tellin'.

01:58.982 --> 02:03.930
Tired of the weight of sin.

02:03.910 --> 02:21.936
...Well, I am coming Lord...

02:21.916 --> 02:27.245
Lord, have mercy now, keep me from the paths of sin.

02:27.265 --> 02:32.393
Oh, Lord now. Hide me in your love.

02:32.413 --> 02:38.523
Oh, Lord now. Write my name above, in the morning.

02:38.563 --> 02:48.700
Now when the gates swing open, oh, Lord, and I'll walk in, walk in.
