00:04.469 --> 00:09.174
This is a Jesse James ballad sung by May Kennedy McCord, June the 5th, 1939.

00:11.097 --> 00:15.402
Jesse James, he was a man who was known throughout the land.

00:15.422 --> 00:18.485
For Jesse, he was bold and bad and brave.

00:18.525 --> 00:26.074
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard went and lay poor Jesse in his grave.

00:26.535 --> 00:28.337
It was on a Friday night.

00:28.677 --> 00:30.179
The moon was shining bright.

00:30.199 --> 00:33.683
Robert Ford had been hiding in a cave.

00:33.916 --> 00:42.367
He did eat of Jesse's bread and slept in Jesse's bed, but he went and laid poor Jesse in his grave.

00:42.387 --> 00:45.792
Jesse had a wife that mourned him all her life.

00:46.072 --> 00:48.676
The children, they were brave.

00:49.437 --> 00:55.485
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard went and laid poor Jesse in his grave.

00:58.469 --> 01:04.969
It was Jesse's brother Frank to drop the Gallatin bank and carry the money from the town.

01:05.000 --> 01:14.000
It was in that very place, they held... and shot Captain Sheeks to the ground.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.487
Then they went to the station, not very far from there, and there Frank and Jesse did the same.

01:20.507 --> 01:27.003
And the agent on his knees, delivered up the keys to the outlaws Frank and Jesse James.

01:28.266 --> 01:31.995
Jesse had a wife to mourn him all her life.

01:32.035 --> 01:35.243
His children, they were brave.

01:35.223 --> 01:43.864
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard, oh, went and laid poor Jesse in his grave.

01:43.884 --> 01:51.021
How the people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death and wondered how he ever come to die.

01:52.233 --> 02:01.003
But it was a sneaking coward, the dirty Robert Ford, that shot Jesse James on the sly.

02:01.023 --> 02:04.847
Jesse had a wife who mourned him all her life.

02:04.867 --> 02:07.830
The children, they were brave.

02:07.890 --> 02:17.641
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard, went and laid poor Jesse in his grave.

02:18.422 --> 02:22.206
Jesse went to rest with his hands upon his breast.

02:22.405 --> 02:26.077
The devil, he will look him in the face.

02:26.097 --> 02:34.525
He was born one stormy day in the county of old Clay and came from a solitary race.

02:35.011 --> 02:39.019
Jesse had a wife to mourn him all her life.

02:39.339 --> 02:42.225
His children, they were brave.

02:43.247 --> 02:53.627
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard laid poor Jesse in his grave.
