Toiling, toiling through the storms and rain.

00:12.899 --> 00:21.750
What fairly passionately waiting till the Savior calls my name.

00:23.492 --> 00:26.536
I am praying, Lord.

00:27.857 --> 00:32.903
I'm trusting in thy word.

00:32.923 --> 00:36.788
Keep me from the path of sin.

00:44.294 --> 01:08.665
Hide me in thy love and write my name above. And when the gate swings open, I'll walk in. Keep you fit for service. I'll help you on every hand.

01:08.932 --> 01:19.512
I have to admit your trials, though someday I'll understand.

01:19.532 --> 01:28.088
I am praying, Lord, I'm trusting in thy word.

01:28.574 --> 01:52.404
Keep me from the path of sin. Hide me in thy love and write my name above. And when the gate swings open, I'll come walking in.

01:52.404 --> 01:56.384
Teach me how to treat my neighbor

01:56.384 --> 02:03.051
Lord, teach me how to love my friend.

02:03.071 --> 02:05.754
Fill me with the Holy Spirit.

02:07.095 --> 02:12.180
Just keep me humble to the end.

02:13.001 --> 02:17.186
I am humble, Lord.

02:17.206 --> 02:20.589
I trust in thy word.

02:22.811 --> 02:25.294
Keep me from the path of sin.

02:27.063 --> 02:35.876
I need that love on my side, my name above.

02:36.417 --> 02:46.371
Oh, and when the gates swing open, I'll go walking in.
