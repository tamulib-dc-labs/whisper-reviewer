00:08.013 --> 00:11.217
Falling through the storms and rain.

00:12.899 --> 00:21.750
What fairly passionately waiting till the Savior calls my name.

00:23.492 --> 00:26.536
I am waiting, Lord.

00:27.857 --> 00:32.903
I'm trusting in thy word.

00:32.923 --> 00:36.788
Keep me from the path of sin.

00:44.294 --> 01:08.665
And when the gate swings open Keep you fit for service I'll help you on every hand

01:08.932 --> 01:19.512
I have to admit your trials, though someday I'll understand.

01:19.532 --> 01:28.088
I am praying, Lord, I'm trusting in thy word.

01:28.574 --> 01:56.404
Keep me from the path of sin Put me in that glow Ride my name about When the gate swings open I'll come walking in Tease me how to treat my neighbor

01:56.384 --> 02:03.051
Lord, teach me how to love my friend.

02:03.071 --> 02:05.754
Fill me with the Holy Spirit.

02:07.095 --> 02:12.180
Just keep me humble to the end.

02:13.001 --> 02:17.186
I am a burden, Lord.

02:17.206 --> 02:20.589
I trust in thy word.

02:22.811 --> 02:25.294
Keep me from the path of sin.

02:27.063 --> 02:35.876
I need that love on my side, my name about.

02:36.417 --> 02:46.371
Oh, and when the wind again, things go fine, I'm walking in.
