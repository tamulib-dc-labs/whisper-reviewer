Carol Swain, Put Your All on the Altar.

00:06.582 --> 00:20.000
[Music.]

00:20.000 --> 00:35.823
You have longed for sweet peace and for faith to increase

00:35.823 --> 00:45.400
You have earnestly, fervently prayed

00:46.702 --> 00:54.456
But you cannot have rest, or be perfectly blessed

00:55.060 --> 01:08.637
Until all on the altar is laid.

01:10.019 --> 01:22.114
Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?

01:22.735 --> 01:34.270
Your heart does the spirit control?

01:34.811 --> 01:47.848
You can only be blessed, have a peace and sweet rest.

01:49.077 --> 02:00.910
When you yield him your body and soul.

02:00.930 --> 02:16.047
Oh, you never will know What the Lord will bestow Of the blessings

02:16.415 --> 02:44.228
For which you have prayed, Till your body and soul he doth fully control, and your all on the altar is laid.
