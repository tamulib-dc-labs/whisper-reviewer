Channel 1, B, is your own on the altar.

00:35.823 --> 00:45.400
You have kindness, live perfectly free.

00:46.702 --> 00:54.456
But you cannot have rest, for before

00:55.060 --> 01:08.637
I might be gleepless until you're on the altar of the hill glade.

01:10.019 --> 01:22.114
In your arms, on the altar of the tree finally,

01:22.735 --> 01:34.270
You're just a spirit, my throne.

01:34.811 --> 01:47.848
You can only be blessed, have a peace and sweet rest.

01:49.077 --> 02:00.910
When you hear him, nobody unknown.

02:00.930 --> 02:16.047
Oh, you never will know What the Lord will be still Of the blessing

02:16.415 --> 02:44.228
For with you I pray Till your body comes home He's a public control And your heart is all that is made
