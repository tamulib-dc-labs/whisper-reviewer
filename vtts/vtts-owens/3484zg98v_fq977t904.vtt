00:00.537 --> 00:07.203
I'm going to leave old Texas, Mildred Webb, Austin, March 4th, 1939.

00:07.463 --> 00:16.031
I'm going to leave old Texas now.

00:16.252 --> 00:20.496
They have no use for the long-horned cow.

00:20.756 --> 00:24.619
They plowed and fenced my cattle in.

00:25.320 --> 00:29.464
And the people there, are strange old things.

00:29.765 --> 00:38.016
How did I yoke to the Alamo and set my face toward Mexico?

00:38.997 --> 00:47.549
I'll spend my days on the wide wide range for the people there don't seem so strange.

00:48.550 --> 00:57.021
The hard hard ground will be my bed and the sad old feet will hold my head.

00:57.305 --> 01:06.135
And when I wake on from my dreams, I'll eat my bread and my sardines.

01:06.695 --> 01:15.605
And when my work on earth is done, I'll turn with the Holy One.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.248
I'll tell St.

01:18.529 --> 01:25.236
Peter that I know, a cowboy soul is white as snow.

01:31.105 --> 01:34.990
He sometimes acted like a man.
