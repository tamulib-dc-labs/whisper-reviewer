Oh Sally, oh Sally, and Sally said he, I'm sorry that your love and mine can't agree.

00:44.889 --> 00:57.949
I know that your beauty will marry you and prove, unless all your hatred will turn on to wealth.

00:58.587 --> 01:12.045
Sir, to say that I hate you or any other man, or to say that I love you is more than I can.

01:13.046 --> 01:19.435
I've gone for too late to have been your discord.

01:20.316 --> 01:27.025
I never will marry you unless I am poor.

01:27.916 --> 01:34.862
Being four, five, and twenty weeks that quickly came and passed.

01:34.882 --> 01:41.328
This young man, he heard of her dance, oh, at last.

01:41.849 --> 01:48.255
He sent for this young man, oh, life's come to die.

01:49.076 --> 01:55.982
All tangled in love, and she is not for high.

01:57.481 --> 02:03.767
Am I any doctor who stands for me here?

02:04.808 --> 02:10.613
Or am I the young man that once loved you, dear?

02:11.294 --> 02:17.420
You are the very one that can kill or can cure.

02:18.181 --> 02:27.049
With that, the resistance I'll die, I ensure.
