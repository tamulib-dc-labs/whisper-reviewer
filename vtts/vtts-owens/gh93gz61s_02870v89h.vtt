00:27.537 --> 00:53.646
While I'm watchin' every devil Ain't touchin' on me time I ain't doin' no more favors Ain't givin' no more plans Every goodbye ain't gone

01:03.768 --> 01:08.941
Every good bar ain't gone.

01:09.282 --> 01:21.692
The important thing about my business is the things I'd buy.

01:35.223 --> 01:43.972
My baby kissed me this morning.

01:43.992 --> 01:51.159
And she even called my house.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.501
And I plead to my soul, darling.

01:55.343 --> 02:01.509
She got a dead cross town somewhere.

02:01.609 --> 02:04.352
Well, my eyes come open.

02:05.817 --> 02:09.202
When she thought that she was gone.

02:09.322 --> 02:18.374
Found my lies come upon me.

02:18.394 --> 02:21.197
When she thought that she was gone.

02:21.498 --> 02:29.469
She said, go to sleep, daddy.

02:29.489 --> 02:32.112
I'm just trying my huge lesson.
