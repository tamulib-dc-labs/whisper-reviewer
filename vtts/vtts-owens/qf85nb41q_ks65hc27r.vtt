00:02.647 --> 00:05.350
The Mosses Runned Away, sung by L.F.

00:05.410 --> 00:06.811
Jeffress, Lovelady, Texas.

00:08.172 --> 00:14.979
Oh, darkies, have you seen the mosses this morning with the mustache on his face?

00:15.620 --> 00:22.106
He was all dressed up this very morning like he's gonna leave the place.

00:23.387 --> 00:30.274
Oh, the mosses left the place, and the darkies stayed at home.

00:30.457 --> 00:36.564
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the air of jubilo.

00:37.465 --> 00:44.254
He's five foot one way, six foot the other, and he's 500 pounds.

00:45.936 --> 00:52.043
His coat's so big that he can't pay the tailor and it won't meet half a round.

00:52.428 --> 00:58.837
Oh, the mosses ran away, and the darkness stays at home.

00:59.618 --> 01:05.266
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the air of jubile.

01:06.167 --> 01:12.175
The mosses saw the smoke way up the river where the Lincoln gunboats lay.

01:12.678 --> 01:18.405
And he picked up his hat and he left in a hurry and I think he's ran away.

01:19.307 --> 01:25.274
All the mosses ran away and the darkest days at home.

01:26.155 --> 01:32.003
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the air of jubileau.

01:38.648 --> 01:45.439
The master lives in the big white house and the dark is in the cabin inn on the lawn.

01:46.060 --> 01:52.170
They'll move their things up the master's parlor to keep it while he's gone.

01:52.952 --> 01:59.442
Oh, the master's ran away and the dark stays at home.

01:59.462 --> 02:05.432
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the air of jubile.

02:06.037 --> 02:11.787
There's wine and cider in the smokehouse cellar and the darkest they'll have come.

02:12.568 --> 02:18.178
I think they'll all be confiscated for the lengthen soldiers come.

02:18.979 --> 02:24.869
All the mosses ran away and the darkest stays at home.

02:25.530 --> 02:31.200
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the air of jubilones.
