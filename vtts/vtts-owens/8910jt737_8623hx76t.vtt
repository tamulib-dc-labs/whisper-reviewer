Most again, here you come down playing my million dollar baby.

00:13.139 --> 00:15.583
I've got a million dollar baby.

00:18.068 --> 00:25.802
Man, she's long and slow.

00:25.822 --> 00:28.266
I've got a million dollar baby.

00:37.679 --> 00:50.097
I swear, and when she woopens, I declare, it's too bad, yeah.

00:50.117 --> 01:03.295
There's a face is so pudding, and a night shape will kill your soul.

01:03.315 --> 01:04.497
And a face is so

01:07.177 --> 01:15.188
And that shape, well, kills your soul.

01:15.208 --> 01:29.729
Says I wouldn't take nothing for my baby, even too long, even too long, wait and go.

01:29.749 --> 01:36.458
I'm telling all you men, I just want to be straight and plain.

01:46.867 --> 01:48.489
I just want to be straight and plain.

01:49.650 --> 01:50.612
Yeah, straight and plain.

01:50.632 --> 01:53.756
That's right, straight and plain.

01:53.776 --> 02:07.994
Well, it really hurts my feelings to hear another man call your name.

02:08.014 --> 02:13.340
I said she's all right with me.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.523
I can see her both night and day.

02:20.735 --> 02:23.079
Yes, that woman's all right with me.

02:26.103 --> 02:28.246
I can see her both night and day.

02:34.376 --> 02:37.741
Says I'd be crazy about that million dollar baby.

02:39.824 --> 02:41.967
Jesus called her way.
