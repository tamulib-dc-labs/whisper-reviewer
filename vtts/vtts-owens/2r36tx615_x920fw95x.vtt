There's an old-fashioned cop that stands by the square.

00:10.108 --> 00:15.354
For ninety-odd years that old cop has to die.

00:16.475 --> 00:21.001
Surrounded by the cop that was born.

00:21.862 --> 00:25.566
The home of my father, the player.

00:33.258 --> 01:02.488
happier lot than our own little family that dwelled in the cot there were father and mother brother sister and I till sickness came o'er us and father did die then brother went off to find something to do

01:02.738 --> 01:29.387
And where he had gone there was none ever knew I tore late and early to keep down the death Of times I can't hear myself pleading with him yet Please spare the dear old home Please spare it I did say

01:29.958 --> 01:35.986
Don't turn out my mother, so feeble and so great.

01:37.007 --> 01:43.035
My kind, loving sister, so sickly and so pale.

01:44.017 --> 01:50.225
Oxineer, oxineer, won't you please stop the sale?

01:51.546 --> 01:58.075
But the oxineer continued to cry on the sale.

01:58.628 --> 02:26.256
And the very best bidder were a man quite unknown His money he paid and he purchased our home Then mother and sister with heart sad and sore Prepared to depart from our old cottage door

02:27.046 --> 02:53.087
When a stranger spoke saying the sorrows be done Return to the home, I'm your only lost son Love and rejoicing was there on that day When brother embraced my old mother
