00:04.688 --> 00:09.194
Barbara Allen from...

00:09.214 --> 00:17.644
It was in the merry month of June when the red rose was blooming.

00:18.005 --> 00:22.490
Sweet William Gray from a north country.

00:23.231 --> 00:27.536
Fell in love with Barbry Allen.

00:27.577 --> 00:29.599
Oh.

00:30.305 --> 00:39.194
He sent his servant down to camp, where Miss Barbry was dwelling.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.897
She says, come.

00:48.663 --> 00:57.052
When Miss Barbry was dwelling, my master said, then he says, come there.

00:57.172 --> 00:58.253
He says, please, Miss Barbry Allen.

00:59.701 --> 01:27.177
Slowly, slowly she got up And slowly she went to him. And as she could say, when she got there, young man I think you're dying. He turned his pale face to the wall

01:27.528 --> 01:31.894
He turned his back upon there.

01:32.696 --> 01:39.966
He says, kind friend, stand around my bed.

01:39.986 --> 01:43.591
Remember Barbry Allen.

01:43.611 --> 01:53.586
As she was walking up and down the street, she saw his corpse a-coming.

01:54.157 --> 01:59.638
She's in death at the corner of every street.

01:59.940 --> 02:04.437
She knows, Barbry Allen.

02:15.166 --> 02:20.282
Sweet William Gray, that's a love today.

02:20.543 --> 02:24.636
Remember that sorrow tomorrow.
