Barbara Allen from his last soul.

00:09.214 --> 00:17.644
It was in the merry month of June when the red rose was blooming.

00:18.005 --> 00:22.490
Sweet William Gray from a north country.

00:23.231 --> 00:27.536
Tell the lovely Barbara Allen.

00:27.577 --> 00:29.599
Oh.

00:30.305 --> 00:39.194
He sent his servant down to camp, where Miss Farbury was dwelling.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.897
She says, come.

00:48.663 --> 00:57.052
When Miss Farbury was dwelling, my master said, then he says, come there.

00:57.172 --> 00:58.253
He says, please, Miss Farbury.

00:59.701 --> 01:27.177
Slowly, slowly she got up And slowly she went to him And as she could say, when she got there And then our friend killed Ian He turned his pale face to the wall

01:27.528 --> 01:31.894
He turned his back up from there.

01:32.696 --> 01:39.966
He says, kind friend, stand around my bed.

01:39.986 --> 01:43.591
Remember Bobby Allen.

01:43.611 --> 01:53.586
As she was walking up and down the street, she saw his corpse coming.

01:54.157 --> 01:59.638
She's in death at the corner of every street.

01:59.940 --> 02:04.437
She knows she'll walk reality.

02:15.166 --> 02:20.282
Read William Gray, that's a love today.

02:20.543 --> 02:24.636
Remember that sorrow tomorrow.
