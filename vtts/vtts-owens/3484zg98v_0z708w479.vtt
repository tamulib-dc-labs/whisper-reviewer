It's little Joe the Wrangler, he'll wrangle never more His days with the remover they are o'er Was a year ago last April that he joined the outfit here A little Texas strayin' all alone It was late in the evening when he rode up to our herd On a little Texas pony called Shaw

00:28.718 --> 00:36.026
With his brogane shoes and overall the tougher looking kid you never in your life before had saw.

00:37.127 --> 00:43.894
His saddle was a Texas cack made many years ago with an old case where on one foot loosely swung.

00:46.136 --> 00:49.900
And his hot row was a cotton sack, a harder looking kid.

00:51.282 --> 00:54.625
And the canteen from the saddle horn was swung.

00:56.174 --> 01:02.783
He said he'd had to leave his home, his pa had married twice, and his new maw whipped him every day or two.

01:04.806 --> 01:11.536
So he saddled up old Cho one night and lit a shuck this way, and he's now trying to battle his own canoe.

01:13.178 --> 01:19.988
Said if we would give him work he'd do the best he could, though he didn't know straight up about a cow.

01:21.571 --> 01:29.884
So the boss, he cut him out a mound and kindly put him on, cause he sort of liked that little kid somehow.

01:29.904 --> 01:36.514
Learn him to wrangle horses and try to hold him all, and to get them in by daybreak if he could.

01:38.637 --> 01:46.389
To follow the chuck wagon, to always hit the team, to help the cosy nettle Russell Wood.

01:46.409 --> 01:48.372
We had driven to the Pecos,

01:48.622 --> 01:53.349
The weather being fine, we had camped on the south side in a bend.

01:55.391 --> 02:04.284
When the northern comments blowin', we had doubled up our guard, for it taken all of us to hold him in.

02:06.848 --> 02:13.617
Little Joe the Wrangler was called out with the rest, though the kid had scarcely reached a herd.

02:15.284 --> 02:22.334
When the cattle they stampeded like a hill some long they fled and we were all a-riding for the lead.

02:23.737 --> 02:32.289
Between the streaks of lightning the horse we could see ahead was little Joe the Wrangler in the lead.

02:32.309 --> 02:39.520
He was riding old blue rocket with a slicker o'er his head trying to check those cattle in their speed.

02:40.428 --> 02:54.927
at last we got them milling and kind of quieted down and the extra guard back to the camp did go but there was one a missing and we knew it at a glance
