00:02.798 --> 00:05.423
I am.

00:05.443 --> 00:08.969
I am.

00:09.230 --> 00:13.538
I am.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.609
I am.

00:20.110 --> 00:20.571
I am.

00:23.960 --> 00:37.600
On through the dawn, through the night, give me all beauty.

00:40.344 --> 00:46.693
I take my hand, precious Lord.

00:46.943 --> 00:58.995
Lead me on and lead me on and lead me on and lead me on

00:59.313 --> 01:06.647
I am so tight, I am so weak, I am far.

01:07.709 --> 01:18.149
Oh, lead to the storm, and lose your night, and lead your child on me to his life, and lift my hand.

01:18.169 --> 01:22.097
Praise the Lord, lead me on.

01:24.018 --> 01:31.530
Lord, you laid my hand, and lead me on, and let me dance.

01:31.550 --> 01:38.041
I am so tired, I am weak, I am hard.

01:38.902 --> 01:48.658
Oh, lead to the strong, and lead to life, and lead your child on, to lead to life, and take my hand.

01:48.925 --> 01:53.432
Pray to the Lord, lead me on.

01:53.452 --> 02:00.482
The darkness appears, and the night closes.

02:01.163 --> 02:08.734
When my light is almost fine.

02:08.754 --> 02:12.840
Oh, let the river make I dance.

02:12.820 --> 02:18.715
Light my feet off and hold my hand and lift my hand.

02:18.975 --> 02:22.825
Pray to the Lord, lead me on.

02:23.086 --> 02:30.424
Pray to the Lord, lift my hand and lead me on and let me dance.

02:30.404 --> 02:37.474
I am so tight, I am so big, I am far.

02:38.516 --> 02:42.662
Oh, lead through the storm, and do this life.

02:42.682 --> 02:46.307
And lead your child on to this life.

02:46.327 --> 02:48.290
I want you to take my hand.

02:48.691 --> 02:54.319
Great Lord, lead me home.
