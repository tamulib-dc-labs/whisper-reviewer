00:09.734 --> 00:11.964
I'm silver and gold.

00:11.984 --> 00:15.420
Whiskey, you villain, you've been my downfall.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.293
You kick me, you cuff me, but I love you.

00:25.985 --> 00:30.392
Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds, I know you of old.

00:30.412 --> 00:35.559
You robbed my poor pockets of silver and gold.

00:35.579 --> 00:39.145
Whiskey, you villain, you've been my downfall.

00:39.205 --> 00:44.112
You kicked me, you cuffed me, but I love you for all.
