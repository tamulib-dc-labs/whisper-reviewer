As I went out a-walking to breathe the pleasant air, Rolly-troodum-troodum-troodum-rolly-day.

00:14.741 --> 00:25.592
As I went out a-walking to breathe the pleasant air, I saw a lady talking to her daughter fair, Rolly-troodum-troodum-troodum-rolly-day.

Now hush up, dear daughter, and stop your rapid tongue, Rolly-troodum-troodum-troodum-rolly-day.

01:10.838 --> 01:14.364
Oh, if you were to marry, who would be your man?

01:14.424 --> 01:18.171
Rolly-troodum-troodum-troodum-rolly-day.

01:18.632 --> 01:21.977
Oh, if you were to marry, who would be your man?

Hush up, mammy, for you know it's handsome Sam.

They've gone for the parson, the license for the fetch, Rolly-troodum-troodum-troodum-rolly-day 

01:36.000 --> 01:50.000
They've gone for the parson, the license for the fetch. And I'm going to marry before the sunset, Rolly-troodum-troodum-troodum-rolly-day.

There's doctors and lawyers and men that follow the plow. And I'm going to marry for the... Rolly-troodum-troodum-troodum-rolly-day.

02:10.458 --> 02:14.002
Oh, now my daughter's married and well for to do,

02:14.062 --> 02:18.568
Rolly-troodum-troodum-troodum-rolly-day.

02:19.169 --> 02:22.513
Oh, now my daughter's married and well for to do,
