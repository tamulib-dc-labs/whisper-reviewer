00:00.000 --> 000:05.000
My Shanghai Rooster.

000:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Oh I had a farm out west, of farms it was the best.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Had a cross-eyed mule with freckles and red hair

00:15.775 --> 00:22.482
I had one old Shanghai rooster with a wart on his left ear, but now he's died and climbed the golden stair.

00:22.702 --> 00:27.387
Oh, my poor old Shanghai rooster in battle of nobly fell.

00:27.527 --> 00:31.631
For the brown bulldog, he fought long and brave.

00:31.651 --> 00:35.756
All the hens are on a strike, they haven't laid since Saturday night.

00:35.796 --> 00:39.960
They are weeping over my Shanghai rooster's grave.

00:39.960 --> 00:44.000
Some more are coming in late, at the hour of half-past eight.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Singing cock-a-doodle-doo and goodbye Kate.

00:51.213 --> 00:56.161
...Some old Thomas Kess, a flirt with a chicken bullet, that's the game.

00:57.323 --> 01:01.670
He'll never crow again, wink his eye at some old hen.

01:01.690 --> 01:05.837
His nester and his maiden name was Jake.

01:05.857 --> 01:09.883
All the hens are on a strike, they haven't laid since Saturday night.

01:09.943 --> 01:13.609
They are weeping over my Shanghai rooster's grave.

01:14.095 --> 01:18.786
Oh, his comb was like an axe, his teeth was like a pus.

01:18.806 --> 01:22.615
His nester and his maiden name were Jake.

01:22.836 --> 01:26.905
All the hens are on a strike, they haven't laid since Saturday night.

01:26.945 --> 01:31.075
They are weeping over my Shanghai rooster's grave.
