This is Donald Davidson.

00:04.710 --> 00:08.994
I'll sing a song that I learned from my father in Tennessee many years ago.

00:09.194 --> 00:11.897
I don't know the title of it, but it goes like this.

00:13.238 --> 00:18.382
Good morning, good morning, my fair pretty lady.

00:19.143 --> 00:23.667
Good morning, good morning, can you fancy me?

00:23.687 --> 00:32.535
Oh, sir, she said, my fancy is a sailor, one who lately crossed the sea.

00:33.697 --> 00:57.628
Describe him, describe him, my fair pretty lady Describe him, describe him now to me Perhaps I saw some French ball go through him As I was sailing o'er the sea Oh, he was tall and he was handsome

00:57.862 --> 01:01.795
And he was tall in proportion too.

01:02.417 --> 01:06.029
He had black hair and he wore it curly.

01:06.992 --> 01:10.082
Oh, his deep dark eyes of blue.

01:10.552 --> 01:28.020
Cheer up, cheer up, my fair pretty lady Cheer up, cheer up, for I am he And in proof that I am your lover Here's the ring you gave to me
