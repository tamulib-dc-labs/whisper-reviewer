00:08.114 --> 00:37.497
A poor pilgrim of strangers Traveling through this unfriendly world I heard of Earth's city called heaven I'm trying to make it in

00:37.966 --> 00:44.778
Sometimes I'm most hosted and driven.

00:45.580 --> 00:54.616
Sometimes I knew not where to roam.

00:55.677 --> 00:58.843
I heard a verse.

00:59.026 --> 01:02.890
called heaven.

01:05.132 --> 01:09.556
I'm trying to make it in.

01:10.257 --> 01:17.624
My mother has gone on and left me.

01:18.325 --> 01:24.451
My father's still walking in sin.

01:25.071 --> 01:26.653
My

01:27.005 --> 01:56.556
Brother, my sister, gone back on me Just because I'm trying to make it in Sometimes I most toss it undriven Sometimes I knew not where to roam I eat

01:56.789 --> 02:08.689
Heard of a city called heaven I'm trying to make it in
