Come all young people and listen to my song Tell you the young man was always gone For the reason why I cannot tell This young man was always well For the reason why I cannot tell This young man was always well

00:25.597 --> 00:29.643
He went to storm, feeling their sheep dim.

00:29.944 --> 00:32.868
The waves and brites were up to chin.

00:33.349 --> 00:39.799
The careless ways that grow so high made this young man weep and cry.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.825
The careless ways that grow so high

00:44.058 --> 01:00.680
Made this young man weep and cry He went to his nearest neighbor's house Horting as you might circle The conversation did begin Say, young man, have you hold your calm?

01:01.181 --> 01:07.990
The conversation did begin Say, young man, have you hold your calm?

01:08.392 --> 01:15.146
He answered her with a sweet reply, Yes, my dear, I've laid it by.

01:15.607 --> 01:22.381
For dangerous wives, tribes and beans, For don't believe I raise one grain.

01:22.802 --> 01:29.556
For dangerous wives, tribes and beans, For don't believe I raise one grain.

01:29.755 --> 01:36.262
If you don't believe you'll raise your bread, why do you hope to strive to win?

01:36.282 --> 01:43.029
For single I am and single I remain, allay, say, amen, I won't maintain.

01:43.450 --> 01:49.737
For single I am and single I remain, allay, say, amen, I won't maintain.

01:50.257 --> 01:56.985
Now he's going to see a witter, I'm in hope that he won't get her.

01:57.165 --> 01:59.307
For the rank of the hole, the handle of the plow,

01:59.557 --> 02:02.244
So do much better than a watch just now.

02:02.665 --> 02:05.754
He can't raise bread and he can't get a watch.

02:06.295 --> 02:09.043
Round the level back, try the balance of his life.

02:09.464 --> 02:12.452
For a single island, a single island.
