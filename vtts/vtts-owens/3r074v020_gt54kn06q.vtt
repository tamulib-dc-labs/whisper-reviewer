00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[Silence.]

00:11.354 --> 00:12.696
Is this your...Thomas?

00:12.716 --> 00:13.317
She cried.

00:13.377 --> 00:15.300
She is the most wonderful brown.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.265
When you could have had the...that ever the sun had shone on.

00:19.726 --> 00:21.488
Throw none of your slurs...cried.

00:21.528 --> 00:23.411
Throw none of your slurs at me.

00:24.032 --> 00:29.099
For I love the tip of your finger more than the brown girl's whole body.

00:29.119 --> 00:31.843
Than the brown girl's whole body.

00:32.245 --> 00:37.174
The brown girl had a little penknife with blade both keen and sharp.

00:37.756 --> 00:43.086
And between the short ribs and the long, she pierced Fair Ellender's heart.

00:43.106 --> 00:45.450
She pierced Fair Ellender's heart.

00:46.633 --> 00:47.875
Oh...

00:49.036 --> 00:51.442
Oh, what is the matter, fair Ellen, he cried.

00:51.683 --> 00:53.728
What makes you look so pale?

00:54.310 --> 01:01.408
You used to have as rosy cheeks as anyone in our dale, as anyone in our dale.

01:02.070 --> 01:04.817
Oh, are you blind, Lord Thomas, she cried.

01:05.455 --> 01:14.725
You cannot see that I can feel my own heart's blood come trickling to my knees, come trickling to my knees?

01:15.366 --> 01:28.060
He took the brown girl by the hand, he led her down the hall, and with his sword cut off her head and kicked it against the wall, and kicked it against the wall.

01:28.901 --> 01:33.606
He pointed the handle to the sun, the blade unto his breast,

01:34.058 --> 01:37.102
Saying, here's the death of two fond lovers.

01:37.142 --> 01:39.585
God, send our souls to rest.

01:40.346 --> 01:43.130
Go dig my graveney tree.

01:43.551 --> 01:45.874
Go dig it both wide and deep.

01:46.535 --> 01:51.842
And place Fair Ellender in my arms and the brown girl at my feet.

01:52.282 --> 01:55.847
And the brown girl at my feet.
