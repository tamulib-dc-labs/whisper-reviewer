Amazing grace, how to be the sound that makes

00:54.892 --> 01:00.121
I live right here.

01:00.141 --> 01:16.630
I once was lost, but now the last was mine.

01:17.892 --> 01:25.221
And now I need your dreams.

01:26.743 --> 01:41.402
Then hold my heart to him and make my fear.

01:41.602 --> 01:59.982
Thank you.

02:00.670 --> 02:27.758
I've heard many to me, many to me, the power of that earth's land I have for this people.

02:28.210 --> 02:40.010
The dream that brought me safe thus far.

02:41.853 --> 02:53.914
And faith will lead me home.
