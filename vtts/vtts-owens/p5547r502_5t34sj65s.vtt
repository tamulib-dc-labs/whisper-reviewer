still before, and I sang down the Lawson Road.

00:06.754 --> 00:21.327
One day as I was walking down the Lawson Road, the spirit spoken to me, filled my heart with joy.

00:21.528 --> 00:32.518
One day as I was walking down the Lawson Road, while I'm in it,

00:35.519 --> 00:42.448
While I'm in his care, in my Savior's care.

00:42.468 --> 00:48.696
While I'm in his care, in my Savior's care.

00:48.716 --> 00:52.181
Oh, thank Jesus God, his arms all around me.

00:52.221 --> 00:57.668
There's nothing but the Lord can't harm me for us.

00:58.329 --> 00:59.991

While I'm in his care, in my Savior's care.

01:35.870 --> 01:41.298
While I'm in his care, in my Savior's care.

01:41.759 --> 01:48.789
Oh, when Jesus got his arms all around me, there's nothing but the Lord can't harm me.

01:48.809 --> 01:54.177
For I'm in his care.
