00:00.000 --> 00.18.000
[Music.]

00.18.000 -->
My father died when I was young, seventeen years ago. My mother stayed and worked harder...

00:28.803 --> 00:57.679
I have always been stubborn And wanted to have my way. I've not been crooked in my life. This is what I have to say. My mother is a lady

00:58.250 --> 01:02.021
and never done no wrong.

01:02.041 --> 01:06.574
That's why I'm lonely, sad and blue.

01:06.594 --> 01:08.800
I love to sing this song.

01:08.800 --> 01:26.000
[Music.]

01:29.603 --> 01:42.053
I take my guitar with me no matter where I go. And when I feel so blue so bad, I sing my song so sad.

01:46.000 --> 02:04.000
I hear that train a-coming. I'll be on my way...

02:04.000 --> 02:19.000
[Music.]
