00:28.803 --> 00:57.679
I have always been stubborn And wanted to have my way I've not been crooked in my life This is what I have to say My mother is a lady

00:58.250 --> 01:02.021
I've never done no wrong.

01:02.041 --> 01:06.574
That's why I'm lonely, sad and blue.

01:06.594 --> 01:08.800
I love to sing this song.

01:29.603 --> 01:32.053
my gifts are with me
