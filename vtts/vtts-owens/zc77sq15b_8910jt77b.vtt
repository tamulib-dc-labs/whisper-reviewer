This is a song entitled, I Got Mine, sang by J.D.

00:07.642 --> 00:10.327
Dillingham of Austin, Texas.

00:11.389 --> 00:17.100
I went down to attend at an eight-clock game, and it was against my will.

00:17.140 --> 00:21.448
Coons in all my money, except one greenback dollar bill.

00:21.766 --> 00:48.347
there was a hundred dollars bet and the niggers point was nine just then a cop stepped through the door but i got mine i got mine boys i got mine i grabbed that hundred dollar bill and through the window i declined ever since then i've been wearing good clothes living on chickens and wine i'm a leader of society since i got mine

00:50.977 --> 00:57.443
I went down in the turkey feast, them eat bulls were fine.

00:57.743 --> 01:02.348
Half an hour before the table was set, them coons all formed the line.

01:02.368 --> 01:06.292
When they brought that buzzard in, their eyes began to shine.

01:06.312 --> 01:10.216
And they could not wait, but started to grab, but I got mine.

01:11.418 --> 01:12.999
I got mine, boys.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.601
I got mine.

01:15.162 --> 01:19.406
Getting into that piece of fowl, I had a horrible time.

01:19.426 --> 01:23.110
One coon grabbed that eagle with a neck, but I snatched on behind.

01:23.190 --> 01:27.615
And the fellow went, so I had the whole thing, but I got mine.

01:27.595 --> 01:35.322
I went down to call on my girl one night and the hour was just about nine.

01:35.844 --> 01:39.698
I was dressed up like a millionaire and I'm feeling mighty fine.

01:40.268 --> 01:44.114
Found her sitting on another nigger's lap, and you know that ain't a very good sign.

01:44.194 --> 01:49.422
When I told her what I thought of him, I got mine.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.526
I got mine, boys, I got mine.

01:52.867 --> 01:57.053
That coony pulled razor and he used it mighty fine.

01:57.073 --> 02:00.738
I started through the window, but I never got out in time.

02:01.099 --> 02:05.365
Now I eat my meals from the metal chefs, and I got mine.
