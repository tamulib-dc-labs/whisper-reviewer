00:22.401 --> 00:27.608
Lift the breeze for wind after me.

01:39.762 --> 02:08.740
Taste this ring from off my finger Where he placed it long ago Give it to him with the blessing That in dying I bestow Tell him that the token mother

02:09.108 --> 02:33.681

02:35.298 --> 02:39.326

02:41.130 --> 02:49.628
Heart that means this part of music is the stage you're calling me.
