00:02.933 --> 00:05.977
Still before, now sing, Leakin' in the building.

00:06.438 --> 00:11.165
Lord, it just keeps on a-leakin' in.

00:11.906 --> 00:16.573
This old building, Lord, it just keeps a-leakin' in.

00:17.213 --> 00:21.800
This old building, Lord, it just keeps a-leakin' in.

00:22.421 --> 00:27.388
This old building, I believe, I'll...

00:28.027 --> 00:29.829
I'll find a better home.

00:30.310 --> 00:33.113
My mother found Jesus in.

00:33.694 --> 00:38.038
Little building, my mother found Jesus in.

00:38.659 --> 00:43.865
Little building, my mother found Jesus in.

00:43.885 --> 00:49.011
Little building, finally she had to move.

00:49.031 --> 00:50.693
He found a better home.

00:52.748 --> 00:56.334
Leaking, leaking in my building.

00:56.514 --> 00:59.539
Leaking, leaking in my building.

00:59.619 --> 01:05.228
Leaking, leaking in my building.

01:05.528 --> 01:06.650
Oh, no.

01:06.770 --> 01:13.721
Leaking, leaking in my building.

01:13.741 --> 01:17.126
Oh, just keeps leaking in.

01:17.266 --> 01:20.832
Just a building, just keeps leaking in.

01:21.115 --> 01:25.343
It's a villain, man, and can't keep the weekend.

01:25.944 --> 01:32.737
It's a villain, I believe, out after me.

01:32.757 --> 01:36.103
I'll try no better tomorrow.
