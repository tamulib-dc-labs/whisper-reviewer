This is William Hall, sung by Lily Williams.

00:06.515 --> 00:16.228
I will tell you of a brisky young farmer who has lately gone to the sea.

00:16.469 --> 00:29.667
He collected a handsome lady who lived in Deathsnow Town.

00:33.089 --> 00:46.774
If they were angry and they'd say, we will send them far across the ocean, where his face will never be seen.

00:47.375 --> 00:55.350
He roamed and he roamed the ocean over, until he came to his nature.

00:57.035 --> 01:06.355
If Molly was alive and I could find her, I would make her a loveful wife.

01:07.878 --> 01:11.466
Early, early in the morning,

01:11.699 --> 01:15.724
As he was walking down the street.

01:16.765 --> 01:20.971
Oh, drops of rain fell just as it happened.

01:21.872 --> 01:24.895
For the chance of his true love for me.

01:25.556 --> 01:29.401
Good morning, good morning, you pretty fair lady.

01:30.082 --> 01:33.887
Oh, would you choose to fancy me?

01:34.567 --> 01:39.073
Oh, no, I can't see a brisky farmer.

01:39.053 --> 01:43.020
Who has lately gone to the sea?

01:43.901 --> 01:46.526
Oh, describe him.

01:46.546 --> 01:47.568
Oh, describe him.

01:47.588 --> 01:50.673
Oh, describe him to me.

01:51.555 --> 01:59.469
Perhaps I'd see a sword go through him as I've lately crossed the sea.

02:00.210 --> 02:04.217
Oh, yes, I saw him and I knew him.

02:04.501 --> 02:20.485
In his name was William's heart, and I saw that Lord go through him, and in death I saw him shout, that he was created yesterday.

02:21.410 --> 02:26.196
I know, good Lord, what shall I do?

02:26.597 --> 02:30.141
Oh, now we have hearted, broken hearted.

02:30.522 --> 02:34.006
Now, good Lord, what shall I do?

02:35.107 --> 02:41.536
Chub, chub, chub, chub, chub, chub, chub, chub.

02:42.257 --> 02:46.542
And now to convince you of a story.

02:47.143 --> 02:50.407
Here's the rain that you gave me.

02:51.188 --> 02:51.248
Ah.
