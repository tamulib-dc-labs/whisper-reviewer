00:02.309 --> 00:04.532
This is William Hall, sung by Lily Williams.

00:06.515 --> 00:16.228
I will tell you of a brisky young farmer who has lately gone to the sea.

00:16.469 --> 00:29.667
He courted a fair handsome lady who lived in their small town.

00:33.089 --> 00:46.774
And when her parents came to know this, they were angry and did say, we will send him far across the ocean, where his face she will never more see.

00:47.375 --> 00:55.350
He roamed and he roamed the ocean over, until he came to his native land.

00:57.035 --> 01:06.355
If Molly was alive and I could find her, I would make her my lawful wife.

01:07.878 --> 01:11.466
Early, early in the morning,

01:11.699 --> 01:15.724
As he was walking down the street.

01:16.765 --> 01:20.971
Oh, drops of rain fell just as it happened.

01:21.872 --> 01:24.895
For the chance of his true love for meet.

01:25.556 --> 01:29.401
Good morning, good morning, you pretty fair lady.

01:30.082 --> 01:33.887
Oh, would you choose to fancy me?

01:34.567 --> 01:39.073
Oh, no, I fancy a brisky farmer.

01:39.053 --> 01:43.020
Who has lately gone to the sea?

01:43.901 --> 01:46.526
Oh, describe him.

01:46.546 --> 01:47.568
Oh, describe him.

01:47.588 --> 01:50.673
Oh, describe him to me.

01:51.555 --> 01:59.469
Perhaps I've see a sword go through him as I've lately crossed the sea.

02:00.210 --> 02:04.217
Oh, yes, I saw him and I knew him.

02:04.501 --> 02:20.485
In his name was William Hall, and I saw that sword go through him, and in death I saw him fall. So screamed this fair lady,

02:21.410 --> 02:26.196
Oh, good Lord, what shall I do?

02:26.597 --> 02:30.141
Oh, now we have parted broken hearted.

02:30.522 --> 02:34.006
Now, good Lord, what shall I do?

02:35.107 --> 02:41.536
Cheer up, cheer up, you pretty fair lady. Cheer up, cheer up, said he.

02:42.257 --> 02:46.542
And now to convince you of the story.

02:47.143 --> 02:50.407
Here's the ring that you gave me.
