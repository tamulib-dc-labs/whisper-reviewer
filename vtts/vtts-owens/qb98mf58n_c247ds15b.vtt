00:02.377 --> 00:10.105
One day as I wandered, I heard a complaining and saw a poor woman at this girl's gloom.

00:10.605 --> 00:17.312
She glared at the mud and the doorstep was raining and this was her wail as she wielded her broom.

00:17.912 --> 00:24.359
Life is a toil, love is a trouble and the beauty will fade and the riches will flee.

00:24.799 --> 00:30.645
Pleasures they dwindle and prices they bubble and nothing is what one would wish it to be.

00:31.081 --> 00:33.987
There's too much of worriment goes to a bonnet.

00:34.288 --> 00:37.014
There's too much of iron goes to a shirt.

00:37.535 --> 00:40.662
There's nothing that pays for the time you waste on it.

00:40.682 --> 00:43.448
There's nothing that lasts but trouble and dirt.

00:43.969 --> 00:49.782
Sweeping at six, dusting at seven, and breakfast at eight, and dishes at nine.

00:50.032 --> 00:52.594
Potting and panning from ten till eleven.

00:52.955 --> 00:55.697
You scarce break your fast when you plan how to dine.

00:56.317 --> 00:59.000
There's ants in the sugar and slugs in the roses.

00:59.020 --> 01:02.303
And the worms in the cherries and mice in the pies.

01:02.323 --> 01:05.085
The rubbish of spiders no mortal supposes.

01:05.105 --> 01:07.707
With rummaging roaches and damaging flies.

01:08.288 --> 01:11.270
In March it is mud, flush in December.

01:11.611 --> 01:14.573
The midsummer breezes are loaded with dust.

01:14.593 --> 01:17.536
In fall the leaves wither, in muggy September.

01:17.576 --> 01:20.038
The wallpaper rots and the candles will thrust.

01:20.795 --> 01:26.822
Last night in my dreams I was stationed forever on a little lone isle in the midst of the sea.

01:27.543 --> 01:32.568
My one chance of life was a ceaseless endeavor to sweep o'er the waves as they swept over me.

01:33.449 --> 01:36.893
Alas is no dream, again I behold it.

01:37.334 --> 01:39.897
I winked, I am helpless, my face to a birth.

01:40.598 --> 01:47.005
So she rolled down her sleeves and her apron she folded and laid down in bag and was buried in dirt.

01:48.200 --> 02:04.875
And now I'm sober, I'll drink no more, but refuse all the brandy that I came on shore, for it makes a man sick and makes an eww on the floor, for I know how can I endure, how shall I, and how shall I ever get home?
