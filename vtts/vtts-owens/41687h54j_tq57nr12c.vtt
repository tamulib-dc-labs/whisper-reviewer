00:02.309 --> 00:25.752
I come to the garden alone, while the deer is still on the roses, and the voice I hear calling on my ear.

00:26.018 --> 00:54.692
The Son of God discloses And he walks with me And he talks with me And he tells me I am his own And the joy we share

00:54.908 --> 01:08.749
As we tarry there, none her love has ever known.
