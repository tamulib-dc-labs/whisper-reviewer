00:02.292 --> 00:07.100
Windy Bill, sung by Brownie McNell, Austin, Texas, February 19th.

00:10.866 --> 00:16.215
Oh, Windy Bill was a Texas guy, and he could rope, you bet.

00:16.235 --> 00:21.904
He allowed the steer, he could not tie, not found, not found him yet.

00:22.964 --> 00:33.784
They...knew of an old black steer, black steer, black steer, a sort of an old outlaw that ran down in the chaparral just at the head of the draw.

00:35.187 --> 00:45.225
Now this old black steer that stood his ground with punches from everywhere, so they bet old Bill that two to one that he could not get quite there.

00:46.235 --> 00:56.034
So Bill brought out his old grey horse, his withers and back were raw to tackle that big black steer that ran down in the draw.

00:57.978 --> 01:08.158
With his greys and bit and his samstack tree and his chaps and taps to boot and his old McGee tied hard and fast, Bill swore he'd get that fruit.

01:09.539 --> 01:14.045
Now first Bill sort of sauntered around, old Blackie began to fall.

01:14.426 --> 01:19.293
Then threw his tail straight in the air, went a-drifting down the draw.

01:20.775 --> 01:25.041
The old gray horse flew after him, for he had been eating corn.

01:25.501 --> 01:30.248
And Bill, he piled his old McGee right around old Blackie's horns.

01:31.409 --> 01:33.757
The old grey horse, he stopped dead still.

01:33.877 --> 01:35.684
The cinches broke like straw.

01:36.246 --> 01:40.440
And the old McGee and the samsack tree went a-driftin' down the hall.

01:43.846 --> 01:48.715
Bill, he lit in the flint rock pile, his face and hands were scratched.

01:48.735 --> 01:53.183
He said he thought he could rope a snake, but he guessed he'd met his match.

01:53.523 --> 01:57.831
He paid his bets like a little man without a bit of jaw.

01:58.292 --> 02:04.403
He allowed old Blackie was the boss of anything in that draw.
