00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[Silence.]

00:10.000 --> 00:26.440
[Silence.]

00:26.440 --> 00:28.663
Great day in the coming.

00:28.844 --> 00:31.507
What do you say?

00:31.527 --> 00:33.070
He's going to be a porter.

00:33.410 --> 00:35.033
He's going to be a porter up there.

00:35.073 --> 00:35.453
Glory.

00:35.654 --> 00:36.835
Hallelujah.

00:37.156 --> 00:38.578
I'm saved today.

00:38.598 --> 00:38.878
Amen.

00:38.898 --> 00:40.380
I'm going to be saved.

00:40.401 --> 00:40.881
Amen.

00:41.362 --> 00:43.826
Well, then shout glory.

00:43.846 --> 00:45.929
Oh, the dead coming state is going to be a porter.

00:46.309 --> 00:48.673
He's going to be a porter up there.

00:48.693 --> 00:49.854
That glorious day.

00:49.874 --> 00:50.535
Hallelujah.

00:51.136 --> 00:52.538
I can see him now.

00:52.558 --> 00:53.680
What are you going to do?

00:53.947 --> 00:55.129
Gee, he's going to let everybody in.

00:55.149 --> 00:56.130
He's going to be a porter at the gate.

00:56.150 --> 00:58.373
He don't have to be no porter at the gate, no.

00:58.853 --> 01:01.737
He can be whatever he want to in heaven because he'll run heaven.

01:02.558 --> 01:03.940
Hallelujah, what glory.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.241
But he's going to be a porter that day.

01:05.482 --> 01:05.662
Why?

01:05.762 --> 01:07.805
Because he chooses to be a porter that day.

01:08.085 --> 01:10.007
He's going to let them all in.

01:10.027 --> 01:12.410
Hallelujah, I see that there before me now.

01:12.751 --> 01:15.454
Some of you brothers and sisters out there, you call yourself a saint.

01:15.474 --> 01:18.398
You call yourself a saint.

01:18.418 --> 01:19.920
Amen, just like I call myself a saint.

01:20.474 --> 01:21.959
Amen, you're gonna walk up there.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.709
You see, you're walking up there to the golden pearly gates right now.

01:24.849 --> 01:26.656
You're gonna go marching right up there to Jesus.

01:26.696 --> 01:28.121
You're gonna open the gate.

01:28.161 --> 01:29.546
You're gonna say, hello, sister so-and-so.

01:29.726 --> 01:30.248
Who are you?

01:31.443 --> 01:33.487
Oh, I'm sister so-and-so.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.911
Oh, ain't you the one who want to talk about your neighbor?

01:36.512 --> 01:37.975
Yes, he is, but I want to explain that.

01:38.135 --> 01:40.619
I ain't got time to hear no explaining today.

01:41.060 --> 01:42.443
Hallelujah, I got a lot of other folks left.

01:42.623 --> 01:44.086
You got to go to the other place.

01:44.446 --> 01:45.829
It's too late.

01:45.849 --> 01:46.149
Glory.

01:46.169 --> 01:48.794
Hallelujah.

01:49.015 --> 01:49.455
Amen.

01:49.555 --> 01:52.581
Lord God Almighty, I'm saved today.

01:52.781 --> 01:53.182
Amen.

01:53.202 --> 01:54.885
Well, praise his precious name.

01:55.085 --> 01:58.929
And you're going to say, oh, Jesus, let me explain.

01:58.969 --> 02:00.850
There's so many things I want to explain.

02:01.171 --> 02:02.812
Don't push me away on glory.

02:03.052 --> 02:04.934
This my last chance for salvation.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.996
Well, what did they do to old Peter?

02:07.337 --> 02:09.138
They're taking old Peter out there.

02:09.158 --> 02:11.080
What do Hebrew 9 tell us?

02:11.100 --> 02:14.964
Hebrew 9 folk tell us they're taking Peter.

02:14.984 --> 02:21.170
They crucified him with his heels up in the air, with his head a-hanging down.

02:21.190 --> 02:23.792
They poured bile and oil all over him.

02:23.857 --> 02:24.778
What did he say?

02:24.838 --> 02:27.041
He shouted, glory, amen, hallelujah.

02:27.061 --> 02:31.907
And Peter just barely made it.

02:31.927 --> 02:32.387
Oh, glory.

02:32.768 --> 02:34.450
What did they do to St.

02:34.750 --> 02:35.191
John?

02:35.692 --> 02:36.372
To take St.

02:36.412 --> 02:37.554
John out there?

02:37.574 --> 02:41.078
To chop his head off at his shoulder?

02:41.539 --> 02:46.184
To bow him in the eye?

02:46.204 --> 02:46.725
Yes, glory.
