00:03.355 --> 00:19.018
Now tell me what would I do?

00:19.235 --> 00:32.150
If it wasn't for the Lord, he was what I do.

00:32.170 --> 00:33.952
He is everything to me.

00:33.972 --> 00:37.657
He is water in dry places.

00:37.677 --> 00:41.862
We are brave and starving men.

00:42.422 --> 00:46.127
He's my rock and shelter.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.229
He holds me in his hand.

00:49.255 --> 00:58.750
When all these words proceed, put by my side again.

00:58.770 --> 01:02.636
He is everything to me.

01:02.897 --> 01:08.025
Every word I've got along.

01:08.045 --> 01:10.208
Tell me, what would I do?

01:10.549 --> 01:14.014
Tell me, what would I do?

01:13.994 --> 01:24.150
What would I do if it wasn't for the Lord?

01:24.711 --> 01:32.223
What would I do if it was for the Lord?

01:32.243 --> 01:35.648
What would I do if it was for the Lord?

01:35.864 --> 01:40.571
And my ways in dark as night.

01:40.811 --> 01:43.776
Jesus gave me comfort.

01:43.796 --> 01:47.001
He brought me to the light.

01:47.261 --> 01:50.466
He took away my sorrow.

01:50.946 --> 01:53.991
And he made my burden fly.

01:54.207 --> 01:59.875
in every place you'll be.

02:00.116 --> 02:08.528
If it wasn't for the Lord, tell me what would I do?

02:08.648 --> 02:12.394
What would I do?

02:12.554 --> 02:16.580
What would I do?

02:16.600 --> 02:22.729
If it wasn't for the Lord, tell me what would I do?

02:23.013 --> 02:29.850
He's everything to me
