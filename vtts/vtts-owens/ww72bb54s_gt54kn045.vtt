00:14.054 --> 00:29.319
In the morning time, he is all the ways of the healing home.

00:29.680 --> 00:34.148
He will share the story how he overcomes.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.231
And he'll understand himself at a time.

00:43.467 --> 00:49.575
Take some, feel the smell of some, take your underwear.

00:49.976 --> 00:56.845
And a heart to be made free for the blessed man in thee.

00:56.865 --> 01:02.353
I'm real wonder why the castle will need life to do it.

01:04.780 --> 01:12.673
He will stand himself by his land.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.017
By his night and by his night.

01:16.359 --> 01:27.278
With all the chains of our dear little.

01:27.999 --> 01:28.780
He will stand up for it our own.

01:30.194 --> 01:55.324
Oh

02:02.982 --> 02:06.732
Let's go.
