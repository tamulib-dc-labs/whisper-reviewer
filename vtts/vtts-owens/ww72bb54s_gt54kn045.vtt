00:14.054 --> 00:29.319
By and by, when the morning comes
When all the saints are gathering home

00:29.680 --> 00:34.148
We'll tell the story of how we'll overcome

00:34.368 --> 00:36.231
And we'll understand it better by and by.

00:43.467 --> 00:49.575
Take some, feel the smell of some, take your underwear.

00:49.976 --> 00:56.845
And a heart to be made free for the blessed man indeed.

00:56.865 --> 01:02.353
I'm real wonder why the castle will need life to do it.

01:04.780 --> 01:12.673
And we'll understand it better by and by.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.017
By and by, when the morning comes

01:16.359 --> 01:27.278
When all the saints are gathering home

01:27.999 --> 01:28.780
We'll tell the story of how we'll overcome

01:30.194 --> 01:55.324
And we'll understand it better by and by.
By and by, when the morning comes
When all the saints are gathering home
We'll tell the story of how we'll overcome
And we'll understand it better by and by.
