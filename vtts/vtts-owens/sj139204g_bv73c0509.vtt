The Orphan Girl.

00:04.002 --> 00:28.738
No home, no home, fled a little girl At the door of a princely hall As she trembling stood on the polished shelf And leaned on the marble wall My father, alas, I never knew

00:28.887 --> 00:32.732
And a tear dimmed her eyes so bright.

00:33.493 --> 00:38.360
My mother sleeps in a new-made grave.

00:39.722 --> 00:43.427
Tis an orphan begs tonight.

00:44.268 --> 00:48.634
Her clothes were thin and her feet were bare.

00:49.015 --> 00:52.780
But the snow had covered her head.

00:53.762 --> 00:58.388
Oh, give me home, she feebly said.

00:58.840 --> 01:24.291
A home and a bit of bread The night was dark and the snow fell fast But the rich man closed his door And his proud face frowned as he scornfully said No room, no bread for the poor

01:24.912 --> 01:33.604
The morning dawned and the orphan girl still lay at the rich man's door.

01:34.446 --> 01:45.942
But her soul had fled to a home above where there's room and bread for the cook.
