If Brother Jack Were Here.

00:04.061 --> 00:28.941
Two drummers they were seated In a grand hotel one day. While dining they were chatting In a joking sort of way. There came a pretty waitress To bring a tray of food.

00:29.512 --> 00:34.307
They spoke to her familiarly in a manner rather rude. At first she did not notice or make a least reply. But one remark was made to her, brought teardrops to her eye.

00:50.960 --> 01:18.418
She turned on her tormentors. Her cheeks were blushing red, Approaching as a picture And this is what she said, My mother was a lady And this you will allow,

01:19.377 --> 01:26.147
You may have a sister who needs protection now.

01:26.868 --> 01:35.200
I've come to this great city to find my brother dear.

01:35.220 --> 01:42.130
You would dare insult me sir if brother Jack were here.

01:42.911 --> 01:46.296
These two sat there in silence.

01:46.816 --> 02:14.342
Their heads hung down with shame Forgive me, miss, we meant no harm Pray tell me what's your name? She told him and he cried aloud I know your brother too. We've been friends for many, many years And he often speaks of you

02:14.963 --> 02:31.179
Come go with me when I go back, and if you'll only wish, I'll take you to him as my bride, for I love you since you said.

02:31.199 --> 02:38.427
My mother was a lady, and this she would allow.

02:39.568 --> 02:41.730
You may have a sister who needs protection now.
