00:00.655 --> 00:05.149
Went out a-sparkin', didn't know where to go. Went to a man's house down here below. 

00:05.149 --> 00:14.149 
The children crying for bread and the old folks gone, the girls all mad and their heads' not combed, the girls all mad and their heads' not combed.

00:14.149 --> 00:22.248
I sat and sparked till I got ashamed, and every once in a while they'd ask me my name, and every once in a while they'd ask me my name.

00:22.248 --> 00:32.228
When they go to cook I'll tell you how they do. They build up the fire as high as your head. Scratch out the ashes and pile them on the bread, scratch out the ashes and pile them on bread.

00:32.228 --> 00:46.063
They called me to dinner and I thought for to eat. The first thing I saw was a big chunk of meat cooked half done and tough as a maul, an old ash cake baked bran and all, an old ash cake baked bran and all. 

00:46.063 --> 00:55.043
One old knife and nary a fork, I sawed for an hour and couldn't make a mark, I sawed for an hour and couldn't make a mark.

00:55.043 --> 00:57.787
Kept on sawing till I got it out of my plate.

00:57.947 --> 01:00.270
One of the girls says, You'd better wait.

01:00.430 --> 01:02.794
Kept on sawing till I got it on the floor.

01:03.054 --> 01:05.337
Up with my foot and kicked it out the door,

01:05.558 --> 01:08.041
Up with my foot and kicked it out the door.

01:08.582 --> 01:11.045
Long come the old man, with his double-barreled gun.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.709
One of the girls says, you'd better run.

01:13.729 --> 01:16.333
Stood and fought him as brave as a bear.

01:16.353 --> 01:18.876
Tangled my fingers in the old man's hair.

01:18.916 --> 01:21.760
Tangled my fingers in the old man's hair.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.546
When they go to church, I'll tell you what to wear.

01:24.566 --> 01:27.131
An old cotton dress, and that's the very best.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.697
An old lint sack grease all around.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.142
An old leather bonnet with a hole in the crown.

01:32.162 --> 01:34.888
An old leather bonnet with a hole in the crown.
