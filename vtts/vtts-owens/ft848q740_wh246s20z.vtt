The Old Chisholm Trail, sung by Brownie McNeill, Austin, Texas, October 21st, 1939.

00:07.832 --> 00:13.478
Now come along, boys, and listen to my tale.

00:13.558 --> 00:15.580
I'll tell you my troubles on the Old Chisholm Trail.

With a $10 mule and a $50 saddle, I'm a-going out west to punch Texas cattle.

Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

00:37.799 --> 00:39.762
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

00:41.605 --> 00:45.571
I woke one morning, I was up on the trail with a rope in my hand, and a cow by the tail.

00:45.591 --> 00:47.294

00:57.470 --> 00:59.653
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

One foot in the stirrup and my hand on the horn, I'm the best darn cow puncher ever was born.

01:17.755 --> 01:19.678
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.486
It's nothin' but beans from day to day, and sooner be eatin' up a wagon load of hay.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.792
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

01:49.556 --> 01:51.639
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

01:53.841 --> 01:57.927
Well, we rounded them up, and we got them on the car, and that was the last of the old U-4.

01:57.947 --> 01:59.709
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

02:00.069 --> 02:02.192
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

02:09.857 --> 02:11.921
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

02:13.623 --> 02:17.669

Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

02:19.793 --> 02:21.936
