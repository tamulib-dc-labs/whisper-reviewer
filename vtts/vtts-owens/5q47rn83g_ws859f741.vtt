00:02.512 --> 00:03.834
The Spanish Fandilio.

00:08.161 --> 00:10.926
I am the Spanish Fandilio.

00:10.946 --> 00:14.411
I live in my great big Castileo.

00:15.132 --> 00:22.444
I'm proud of my tra-la-la-lilio and the works of my sweetle-dum-deer.

00:23.791 --> 00:30.477
One night I went to the abridio, and there I met a young senorito.

00:30.918 --> 00:37.785
I showed her my tra-la-la-lilio, and the works of my tweedledum, dear.

00:39.686 --> 00:42.609
I took her back to my castileo.

00:43.150 --> 00:47.954
I laid her upon the sofileo.

00:47.974 --> 00:53.680
My tra-la-la-lilio, and the works of my tweedledum, dear.

00:57.035 --> 01:00.101
Next day I went to the doctorilio.

01:00.542 --> 01:03.508
I showed him a tra-la-la-lilio.

01:03.909 --> 01:12.006
He says, you have got the sophilio in the works of your tweedledum, dear.

01:12.492 --> 01:27.463
Now I sit in my famous Castillo, with a roll of cotton bandillo, a swab of my tra-la-la-lilio, and the works of my tweedle-dom-dee.
