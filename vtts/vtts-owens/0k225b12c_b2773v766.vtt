Bill Johnson Lost his Legion of Watermelons, sung by Tom Ballentine.

00:08.851 --> 00:13.417
Bill Johnson went one day to a church upon the hill.

00:13.897 --> 00:17.181
He thought he'd hear the good man preach and pray.

00:17.201 --> 00:27.152
But if the king had lived a wicked soul, he stayed from Dyer's Hill till he thought it was time to cast his sins away.

00:27.588 --> 00:32.617
But when the parson called on Bill, he stumbled up the aisle.

00:33.117 --> 00:36.844
He's thinking as he slowly fell in line.

00:37.785 --> 00:42.954
On Bill's way home, the shining moon was sinking all the while.

00:43.595 --> 00:47.221
Exposed a million smiling on the vine.

00:48.043 --> 00:50.347
Bill slowly climbed the fence.

00:52.150 --> 00:53.612
Hmm, what a mince.

00:54.284 --> 01:00.490
Oh, my, melon fever's on.

01:00.510 --> 01:08.097
Oh, my, here's where I'm going.

01:08.718 --> 01:15.084
If you want to save my soul tonight, you've got to hide that old moonlight.

01:15.344 --> 01:22.131
When I see melons, I write, melon fever's on.
