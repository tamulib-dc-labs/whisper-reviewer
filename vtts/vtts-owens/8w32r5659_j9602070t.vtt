00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Home Sweet Home.

00:08.000 --> 00:18.000
Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam.

00:18.000 --> 00:30.000
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.

00:30.000 --> 00:43.000
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there,

00:43.000 --> 00:57.000
Which sweet through the world, is never met with elsewhere. 

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
Home, sweet home.

01:04.000 --> 01:18.000
There's no place like home. There's no place like home.

01:18.000 --> 01:30.000
An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain.

01:30.000 --> 01:42.000
Oh give me my lowly thatched cottage again.

01:42.000 --> 01:54.000
The birds singing gaily that came at my call,

01:54.000 --> 02:05.000
Give me them with peace of mind dearer than all.

02:05.000 --> 02:15.000
Home, sweet home.

02:15.000 --> 02:30.000
There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
