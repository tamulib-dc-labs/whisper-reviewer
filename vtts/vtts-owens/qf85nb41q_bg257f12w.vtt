00:01.280 --> 00:02.001
Joe Bowers.

00:02.822 --> 00:05.826
My name is Joe Bowers.

00:06.447 --> 00:07.729
I have a brother Ike.

00:08.149 --> 00:11.674
I came from old Missouri.

00:12.114 --> 00:14.538
Yes, all the way from Pike.

00:15.519 --> 00:20.205
I used to court a pretty girl by the name of Sally Black.

00:21.367 --> 00:23.569
I asked her to marry me.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.532
She said it was a whack.

00:26.288 --> 00:37.646
But says she to me, Joe Bowers, before we hitch for life, you'd better get a little house to keep your little wife.

00:37.666 --> 00:43.536
I says, Sally, oh Sally, it's all for your sake.

00:43.556 --> 00:49.145
I'll go down to California and try to raise a stake.

00:49.165 --> 00:53.832
At length I went to mining, put in my biggest licks.

00:54.453 --> 00:59.378
Fell down upon the shining, just like a thousand bricks.

01:00.339 --> 01:04.983
I worked both late and early, through rainstorm and snow.

01:05.684 --> 01:10.329
It was all for my dear Sally's sake, oh yes, the same to Joe.

01:11.310 --> 01:15.534
At length there came a letter, it was from my brother Ike.

01:16.355 --> 01:20.899
It came from old Missouri, yes, all the way from Pike.

01:21.470 --> 01:26.318
It had some of the goldarnedest news a fellow ever heard.

01:26.338 --> 01:31.005
That Sally had married a butcher and the butcher had red beard.

01:31.686 --> 01:36.113
There was something more in this letter that would make a fellow swear.

01:36.814 --> 01:43.765
That Sally's got a baby and the baby's got red hair.
