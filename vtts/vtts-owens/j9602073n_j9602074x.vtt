I am an Old Bachelor. I am an old bachelor, oh-ho-ho.

00:13.786 --> 00:18.211
I am an old bachelor, oh-ho-ho.

00:18.832 --> 00:24.418
Still an old bachelor, it's no matter for you, fa-la-lay, fa-la-lay.

00:25.079 --> 00:30.105
Still an old bachelor, it's no matter for you, fa-la-la-lay.

00:30.743 --> 00:36.392
My heart is almost broken, oh-ho-ho.

00:36.933 --> 00:42.362
My heart is almost broken, oh-ho-ho.

00:43.023 --> 00:45.927
If your heart is broke, it's very broken.

00:46.609 --> 00:48.992
fa-la-lay, fa-la-lay.

00:49.433 --> 00:52.278
If your heart is broke, it's very broken.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.962
fa-la-la-lay.

00:55.617 --> 00:59.140
I'm going away to leave you.

01:00.281 --> 01:01.542
oh-ho-ho.

01:02.423 --> 01:05.646
I'm going away to leave you.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.808
oh-ho-ho.

01:08.228 --> 01:11.591
Go and go and just keep on going.

01:11.611 --> 01:14.033
fa-la-lay, fa-la-lay.

01:14.474 --> 01:17.136
Go and go and just keep on going.

01:18.277 --> 01:19.338
fa-la-la-lay.

01:20.419 --> 01:22.621
Or you'll be sorry.

01:23.662 --> 01:25.303
oh-ho-ho.

01:25.570 --> 01:28.437
Oh, you'll all be sorry, oh-ho-ho.

01:31.344 --> 01:36.857
I am sorry, you'll not know it, fa-la-lay, fa-la-lay.

01:37.498 --> 01:42.550
I am sorry, you'll not know it, fa-la-la-lay.
