I am an old bachelor, oh-ho-ho.

00:13.786 --> 00:18.211
I am an old bachelor, oh-ho-ho.

00:18.832 --> 00:24.418
Still an old bachelor, it's no matter for you, fa-la-lay, fa-la-lay.

00:25.079 --> 00:30.105
Still an old bachelor, it's no matter for you, fa-la-lay.

00:36.933 --> 00:42.362
My heart is almost broken, oh, oh, oh.

00:43.023 --> 00:45.927
If your heart is broke, it's very broken.

I'm going away to leave you.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.808
Oh, oh, oh.

01:08.228 --> 01:11.591
Go and go and just keep on going.

01:11.611 --> 01:14.033
Fa la la, fa la la.

01:14.474 --> 01:17.136
Go and go and just keep on going.

01:18.277 --> 01:19.338
Fa la la la.

01:20.419 --> 01:22.621
Or you'll be sorry.

01:23.662 --> 01:25.303
Oh, oh, oh.

01:25.570 --> 01:28.437
Oh, you'll all be sorry.

01:31.344 --> 01:36.857
I am sorry, you'll not know it.

01:37.498 --> 01:42.550
I am sorry, you'll not know it.
