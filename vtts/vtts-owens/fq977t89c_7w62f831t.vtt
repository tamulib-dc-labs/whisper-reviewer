The Bastard King of England, Austin, Texas, March 1939.

00:07.132 --> 00:14.360
Oh, the minstrel sing of a British king who lived long years ago.

00:14.441 --> 00:20.287
He ruled the land with an iron hand, but his mind was weak and low.

00:20.307 --> 00:29.397
The only clothing that he wore was a dirty yellow shirt with which he used to hide the hide, but he couldn't hide the dirt.

00:30.338 --> 00:39.454
He loved to hunt the bounding slags that roam the royal wood, and he also was exceedingly fun pulling the royal hood.

00:41.223 --> 00:50.053
Now the Queen of Spain was a sprightly dame of Gay Colleen, was she who loved to fool with the royal tools of King across the sea.

00:51.654 --> 01:00.564
So she sent a special message by a royal messenger to ask the King to come and spend a week or two with her.

01:01.925 --> 01:10.875
When Philip of France had heard the news, he swore before his court, he must refer my rival because my dog is short.

01:10.990 --> 01:16.599
So he commissioned the duke to have her sack, to give the queen a dose of clap.

01:16.839 --> 01:22.288
Oh, what a blow was that to England.

01:22.308 --> 01:31.262
When the news of this disaster had reached old England's halls, the king swore by his testicles he'd have the bastard's balls.

01:32.625 --> 01:36.711
So he offered half his kingdom, and a knight was fair hortense.

01:37.147 --> 01:41.271
to any loyal subject who was not the king of France.

01:43.393 --> 01:52.262
So the loyal Duke of Suffolk betook himself to France, declared himself a fluter, and the king took down his hand.

01:53.824 --> 02:03.053
So he tied a song to the royal dong, jumped on his horse and rode along back to the bastard king of England.

02:04.805 --> 02:13.558
Now, when this strange procession had reached old England's shore, his majesty's pride because of the ride had stretched a yard or more.

02:15.441 --> 02:24.855
When the maidens of the court and all of London town beheld this marvelous sexo tried to hell with the British crown.

02:25.358 --> 02:30.215
Philip of France, he searched the throne, battled manfully using the royal bone.

02:30.295 --> 02:35.132
God saved the bastard king of England.
