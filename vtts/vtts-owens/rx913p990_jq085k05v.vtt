00:01.550 --> 00:05.618
Way down in West Virginia, lived a gal named Nancy Brown.

00:05.698 --> 00:09.285
Never seen such beauty in city or in town.

00:09.305 --> 00:16.279
Now Nancy and the deacon climbed the mountainside one day, but Nancy didn't like just what the deacon had to say.

00:16.379 --> 00:22.731
She came rolling down the mountain, she came rolling down the mountain, rolling down the mountain mighty soon.

00:23.032 --> 00:51.098
Cause she wouldn't give the deacon that fair thing that he was seeking And she's just as pure as her old pappy's moon And then there came a cowboy, a cowboy big and strong He took our Nancy Walken, but she still knew right from wrong She came rollin' down the mountain, she came rollin' down the mountain Rollin' down the mountain by the steel For despite the cowboy's urging, she is still the local virgin And she's just as pure as moonlight on the hill

00:51.415 --> 00:54.939
And then there came a trapper with his knapsack on his back.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.904
He took our Nancy walkin' away up to his shack.

00:58.924 --> 01:05.733
She came rollin' down the mountain, she came rollin' down the mountain, rollin' down the mountain mighty wise.

01:06.173 --> 01:10.098
For to fight the trapper's cunning, she didn't feel like fun.

01:10.118 --> 01:13.963
And then she's just as pure as West Virginia skies.

01:14.602 --> 01:18.106
Then there came a city slicker with his hundred dollar bill.

01:18.426 --> 01:22.551
He took Nancy and his Chevy up those West Virginia hills.

01:22.571 --> 01:24.874
Oh, she stayed up in the mountains.

01:24.934 --> 01:27.056
She stayed up in the mountains.

01:27.557 --> 01:30.900
She stayed up in the mountains all the night.

01:32.122 --> 01:34.404
She came home next morning early.

01:34.464 --> 01:37.728
More a woman than a girlie.

01:38.749 --> 01:41.132
And her pappy kicked the hussy out of sight.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.311
Oh, she's living in the city.

01:43.331 --> 01:44.895
Yes, she's living in the city.

01:45.176 --> 01:48.223
She's living in the city mighty swell.

01:48.684 --> 01:52.052
She's a-dining and she's dining on her fanny.

01:52.093 --> 01:53.977
She's reclining.

01:54.017 --> 01:58.969
And those West Virginia hills can go to hell.
