00:02.461 --> 00:07.386
Michael Finnegan, a song which repeats as many stanzas as necessary.

00:08.167 --> 00:10.250
There was no man named Michael Finnegan.

00:10.330 --> 00:12.112
He grew whiskers on his chin again.

00:12.132 --> 00:14.054
He cut them off, but they grew in again.

00:14.354 --> 00:16.276
Poor old Michael Finnegan.

00:16.296 --> 00:18.298
Same thing, second verse.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.341
There was no man named Michael Finnegan.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.283
He grew whiskers on his chin again.

00:22.703 --> 00:24.565
Cut them off, but they grew in again.

00:24.645 --> 00:26.207
Poor old Michael Finnegan.
