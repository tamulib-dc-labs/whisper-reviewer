00:01.465 --> 00:30.932
I am a poor pilgrim, a stranger Traveling through this unfriendly world I heard of a city called heaven

00:31.570 --> 00:40.001
I'm drivin' to make it easy.

00:41.182 --> 00:49.553
Sometimes I'm full-tossed in hundreds, hundreds.

00:49.573 --> 00:55.941
Sometimes I knew not where to roam.

00:56.258 --> 01:21.253
I heard of a city called heaven I'm driving to make it in My mother has gone on and left me

01:21.503 --> 01:31.834
All in this world alone.

01:31.854 --> 01:39.803
My father is still walking in sin.

01:40.824 --> 01:46.650
My brother and sister...
