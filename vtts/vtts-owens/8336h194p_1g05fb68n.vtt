Too Late by Clay Cochran, Amarillo, Texas, March the 4th, 1939.

00:08.453 --> 00:16.542
So you've come back to me once more.

00:16.602 --> 00:22.588
The old, old love is growing yet.

00:22.608 --> 00:27.733
You've tried through all these many years.

00:28.014 --> 00:31.337
You have tried so vainly too far.

00:34.979 --> 00:57.915
So you've come back to me once more Since time at last has made you free To ask again of me the heart Whose early ties were bound to me

00:58.368 --> 01:27.463
Come near and let me see your face Your chestnut hair is tinged with snow Yet still it is the same old face I loved so fondly years ago The same that on that summer's eve

01:28.135 --> 01:56.370
Been over me and kissed my brow Those happy, happy hours of love Ah, well, they are all over now Oh, no, you cannot touch my hand God never gives us back, are you?

01:59.489 --> 02:04.574
between can e'er be spent.

02:04.594 --> 02:11.941
Our paths must lie apart soon.

02:11.961 --> 02:17.367
Forgive you do not speak the word.

02:17.387 --> 02:23.613
You never meant to do me wrong.

02:23.633 --> 02:27.657
God sent this anguish to my heart.

02:29.105 --> 02:32.803
You teach me to be brave
