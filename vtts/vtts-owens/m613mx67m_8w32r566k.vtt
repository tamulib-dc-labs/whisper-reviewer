00:02.174 --> 00:07.020
Way down in West Virginia lived a girl named Nancy Brown.

00:07.270 --> 00:11.796
You've never seen such beauty in city or in town.

00:12.357 --> 00:16.723
Now Nancy and the deacon climbed the mountainside one day.

00:17.424 --> 00:21.429
But Nancy didn't like just what the deacon had to say.

00:21.529 --> 00:23.352
She came rolling down the mountain.

00:23.412 --> 00:25.755
She came rolling down the mountain.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.499
Rolling down the mountain mighty soon.

00:28.519 --> 00:32.965
For she didn't give the deacon that there thing that he was seeking.

00:33.065 --> 00:36.990
And she's just as pure as West Virginia's moon.

00:36.970 --> 00:42.298
And then there came a sailor in his funny suit of clothes.

00:42.318 --> 00:45.923
She took our Nancy walking, where the good Lord only knows.

00:45.943 --> 00:49.749
She came rolling down the mountain, she came rolling down the mountain.

00:50.350 --> 00:53.374
Rolling down the mountain by the dam.

00:54.156 --> 00:58.021
For she's like a virgin, she is still the local virgin.

00:58.142 --> 01:01.126
And she's just as pure as West Virginia ham.

01:01.166 --> 01:06.454
And then there came a cowboy in his funny suit of clothes.

01:06.890 --> 01:10.796
Took our Nancy walkin', where the good lord only knows. 

01:10.796 --> 01:17.000
She came rollin' down the mountain, she came rollin' down the mountain Rollin' down the mountain by the dam. 

01:17.000 --> 01:28.000
Though the cowboy he felt sinny, Nancy didn't feel give-inny And she's just as pure as moonlight on the hill. 

01:28.000 -->
Then there came a trapper with his knapsack on his back

01:33.569 --> 01:37.356
He took our Nancy walkin' way up to his shack.

01:37.376 --> 01:45.169
She came rollin' down the mountain, she came rollin' down the mountain, rollin' down the mountain, mighty wise.

01:45.810 --> 01:55.307
For the trapper was awful cunnin', she didn't feel like funnin', and she's just as pure as West Virginia's skies.

01:55.818 --> 02:00.482
Then came a city slicker with his hundred dollar bills.

02:00.922 --> 02:05.008
He took Nancy and his Chevy up those West Virginia hills.

02:05.709 --> 02:12.258
Oh, she stayed up in the mountains, yes, she stayed up in the mountains.

02:12.879 --> 02:17.526
She stayed up in the mountains all the night.

02:18.227 --> 02:22.813
She came home next morning early, more a...
