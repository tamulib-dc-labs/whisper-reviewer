00:02.174 --> 00:07.020
Way down in West Virginia lived a girl named Nancy Brown.

00:07.270 --> 00:11.796
You've never seen such beauty in city or in town.

00:12.357 --> 00:16.723
Now Nancy and the deacon climbed the mountainside one day.

00:17.424 --> 00:21.429
But Nancy didn't like just what the deacon had to say.

00:21.529 --> 00:23.352
She came rolling down the mountain.

00:23.412 --> 00:25.755
She came rolling down the mountain.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.499
Rolling down the mountain mighty soon.

00:28.519 --> 00:32.965
For she didn't give the deacon that there thing that he was seeking.

00:33.065 --> 00:36.990
And she's just as pure as Westwood Happy's moon.

00:36.970 --> 00:42.298
And then there came a sailor in his funny suit of clothes.

00:42.318 --> 00:45.923
She took our Nancy Walken, where the good Lord only knows.

00:45.943 --> 00:49.749
She came rolling down the mountain, she came rolling down the mountain.

00:50.350 --> 00:53.374
Rolling down the mountain by the dam.

00:54.156 --> 00:58.021
For she's like a virgin, she is still the local virgin.

00:58.142 --> 01:01.126
And she's just as pure as West Virginia ham.

01:01.166 --> 01:06.454
And then there came a cowboy in his funny suit of clothes.

01:06.890 --> 01:32.796
Took our lunchy walkin', where the good lord only knows She came rollin' down the mountain, she came rollin' down the mountain Rollin' down the mountain by the dance still Though the young boy he felt sinny, Nancy didn't feel givenny And she's just as pure as moonlight on the hill Then there came a crapper with his knapsack on his back

01:33.569 --> 01:37.356
our Nancy walkin' way up to his shack.

01:37.376 --> 01:45.169
She came rollin' down the mountain, she came rollin' down the mountain, rollin' down the mountain, mighty's wise.

01:45.810 --> 01:55.307
For the fight, stop, and cunnin', she didn't feel like funnin', and she's just as pure as West Virginia's skies.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.482
with his hundred dollar bills.

02:00.922 --> 02:05.008
He took Nancy and his Chevy up those West Virginia hills.

02:05.709 --> 02:12.258
Oh, she stayed up in the mountains, yes, she stayed up in the mountains.

02:12.879 --> 02:17.526
She stayed up in the mountains all the night.

02:18.227 --> 02:22.813
She came home next morning early, morrow night.
