00:02.731 --> 00:10.185
This is an old song, The Little Sparrow, or Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies, sung by May Kennedy McCarr, June 5, 1939.

00:12.549 --> 00:24.992
Come all ye fair and tender ladies, take warning how you treat young men.

00:39.620 --> 01:08.749
I wish I was

01:14.551 --> 01:44.203
And I had wings and I could fly I'd fly away to my false lovers And there I'd spit me down and cry But I am not a little sparrow

01:44.858 --> 02:08.301
I have no wings and cannot fly So I lay me down in my grief and sorrow I lay me down until I die
