This is an old song, The Little Sparrow, or Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies, sung by May Kennedy McCord, June 5, 1939.

00:12.549 --> 00:24.992
Come all ye fair and tender ladies, take warning how you treat young men.

00:24.992 --> 00:37.000
They're like a star in cloudy morning. They're here and then they're gone.

00:37.000 --> 00:51.000
They'll tell to you some lonesome story. They'll prove to you their love is true.

00:51.000 --> 01:05.000
And then they'll go and court another. That is the love they have for you.

01:05.000 --> 01:14.551
I wish I was a little sparrow.

01:14.551 --> 01:44.203
And I had wings and I could fly. I'd fly away to my false lover. And there I'd spit me down and cry. But I am not a little sparrow

01:44.858 --> 02:08.301
I have no wings and cannot fly. So I lay me down in my grief and sorrow. I lay me down until I die.
