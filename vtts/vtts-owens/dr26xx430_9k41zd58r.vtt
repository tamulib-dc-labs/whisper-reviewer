I love, for I know I ne'er shall see him till we meet in heaven above.

00:26.392 --> 00:39.690
Oh, bury me beneath the willow beneath the weeping willow tree, and we

00:46.555 --> 00:49.818
She will then think of me.

00:49.898 --> 00:57.165
Tomorrow was a wedding day.

00:57.225 --> 01:01.990
God only knows where he may be.

01:02.631 --> 01:09.598
He's gone to see God as a bride.

01:09.618 --> 01:14.082
And now he cares no more for me.

01:17.217 --> 01:26.271
beneath the willow beneath the weeping willow tree.

01:27.373 --> 01:39.411
And when he knows where I lie sleeping free house, he will then think of me.
