00:01.000 --> 00:14.000
My heart is broken. I'm in sorrow weeping for the one I love.

00:14.000 --> 00:25.210
For I know I ne'er shall see him till we meet in heaven above.

00:26.392 --> 00:45.690
Oh, bury me beneath the willow, beneath the weeping willow tree, and when he knows where I lie sleeping

00:46.555 --> 00:49.818
He will then think of me.

00:49.898 --> 00:57.165
Tomorrow was our wedding day.

00:57.225 --> 01:01.990
God only knows where he may be.

01:02.631 --> 01:09.598
He's gone to seek another bride.

01:09.618 --> 01:14.082
And now he cares no more for me.

01:14.082 --> 01:26.271
Oh bury me beneath the willow, beneath the weeping willow tree.

01:27.373 --> 01:39.411
And when he knows where I lie sleeping, perhaps he'll then think of me.
