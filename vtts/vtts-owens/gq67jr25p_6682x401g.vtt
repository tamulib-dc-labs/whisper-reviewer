The Trail to Mexico, sung by Brownie McNeil, Austin, Texas, October 21st, 1939.

00:06.990 --> 00:28.722
I made up my mind in an early day That I'd leave my gal, she was too gay That I'd leave my home and roam for a while And travel out west

00:29.748 --> 00:58.303
For many a mile Was in the year of 83 That old man spent, he said to me He says, young fellow, I want you to go And follow my herd down to Mexico

01:00.595 --> 01:05.201
It was in the merry month of May.

01:05.262 --> 01:10.949
We rounded up and we went away.

01:12.231 --> 01:22.806
I'm telling you boys, it was a lonesome go along the trail down to Mexico.

01:25.047 --> 01:46.212
When I arrived in Mexico I wanted to see my love but I couldn't go I wrote a letter to my dear But never a word from her could I hear

01:48.453 --> 01:58.843
When I got back to my once loved home, I called for the darling of my own.

01:58.904 --> 02:04.709
They said she had married a richer life.

02:04.729 --> 02:09.694
Therefore, wild cowboy, you may seek another wife.

02:13.198 --> 02:18.223
Oh, the girl she's married I do adore.

02:18.372 --> 02:35.217
And I cannot stay at home anymore I'll make my way to the Rio Grande All the way out west with my cowboy band
