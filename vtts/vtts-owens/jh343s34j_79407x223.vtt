00:05.195 --> 00:16.620
As I walked out in the streets of Laredo, as I walked out in Laredo one day. 

00:16.620 --> 00:28.000
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped up in white linen, wrapped up in white linen as cold as the clay.

00:29.849 --> 00:39.587
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy, these words he did say as I boldly stepped by.

00:42.352 --> 00:51.469
Come sit now beside me and hear my sad story, I was shot in the breast and I'm going to die.

00:54.858 --> 01:00.226
Oh, beat the drum slowly, and play the pipe lowly, play

01:00.246 --> 01:05.994
the dead march as they carry me on.

01:06.014 --> 01:10.240
Oh, carry me over the long green valley.

01:10.581 --> 01:12.443
I'm only a cowboy.

01:12.904 --> 01:13.525
I know I've done wrong.

01:21.318 --> 01:30.536
In the saddle I used to go dashing, t'was once in the saddle I used to be gay.

01:30.596 --> 01:43.140
I first took to drinking and then to card playing, got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.

01:44.605 --> 01:54.922
Go gather around you a crowd of young cowboys and tell them the story of this my sad fate.

01:56.645 --> 02:04.858
Tell one and the other before they go further to stop their wild wolfing before it's too late.

02:08.585 --> 02:19.460
Oh, please go and fetch me a cup of cold water to bathe my parched lip, the poor fellow said.

02:19.480 --> 02:29.014
But ere we had brought it, his spirit had left him, it gone to his maker, the poor boy was dead.

02:30.376 --> 02:37.866
Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the pipe lowly, play, the dead march as they carry me on.

02:37.846 --> 02:46.995
Oh, carry me over the long green valley. I'm only a cowboy. I know I've done wrong.
