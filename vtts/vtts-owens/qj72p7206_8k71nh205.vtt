Cruel War. Dearest one do you remember when last me did me? How you told me how you loved me kneeling at my feet?

00:24.027 --> 00:49.275
Oh, how proud you stood before me In your suit of grace, When you vowed for me in country Ever to be free. Weeping sad and lonely,

00:49.694 --> 01:10.420
sighs and tears how vain, when this cruel war is over praying then to meet again. But our country calls you loved one

01:10.822 --> 01:39.107
Angels guide your way While your southern boys are fighting We can only pray. When you strike for God and freedom Let all nations see How you loved your southern banner

01:39.509 --> 02:09.043
Emblem of the free. Weeping sad and lonely Sighs and tears how vain When this cruel war is over Praying then to meet again. If amid the line of battle

02:09.513 --> 02:37.663
Nobly you should fall Far away from those who loved you None to hear your call. Often dream I see you lying On a battle plane Lonely, wounded, even dying

02:37.998 --> 02:41.983
Calling but in vain.
