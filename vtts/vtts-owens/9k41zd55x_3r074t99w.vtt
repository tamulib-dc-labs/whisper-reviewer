Oh, I couldn't hear nobody pray. Couldn't hear nobody pray. Way down yonder by myself, couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:25.000 --> 00:42.000
Oh, I couldn't hear nobody pray. Couldn't hear nobody pray. Way down yonder by myself, couldn't hear nobody pray.

00:44.000 --> 01:01.051
Oh hallelujah, couldn't hear nobody pray. ...couldn't hear nobody pray. In the kingdom, couldn't hear nobody pray. With the savior, couldn't hear nobody pray. Oh Lord.

Couldn't hear nobody pray. Couldn't hear nobody pray. Way down yonder by myself, couldn't hear nobody pray.
