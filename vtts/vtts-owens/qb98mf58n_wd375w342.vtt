You bluebirds, sober as you see Clear cold water is the drink for me A little drink here and a little drink there Still keeps seeing my temperance air Oh, don't deny it, better, better try it Clear cold water from the spring below Better, better try it, better, better try it Try sir, try sir, do

00:30.457 --> 00:41.974
Soon after I was married I went to an inn Very long time I tarried a drinking of gin Till I filled my sister and clear up to the brim Crying, oh, how can I?

00:41.994 --> 00:43.817
And oh, how shall I?

00:44.238 --> 00:47.022
And how shall I ever get home?

00:47.963 --> 00:57.578
In some parts of the world it is called a disgrace For the road to fly up and hit a man in the face But still I kept on in my staggering pace

00:57.558 --> 00:59.341
Crying, oh, how can I?

00:59.701 --> 01:01.324
And oh, how shall I?

01:01.865 --> 01:04.409
And how shall I ever get home?

01:05.270 --> 01:14.565
At last I got home and got up to the door And I kicked and I stomped and I cut and I swore For my wife to get up and open the door Crying, oh, how can I?

01:14.906 --> 01:16.408
And oh, how shall I?

01:16.929 --> 01:19.453
And how shall I ever get home?

01:20.194 --> 01:25.202
At last she got up and opened the door And the first step I took I fell sprawled in the floor

01:25.182 --> 01:51.628
and that wakened the baby and he began to roar crying oh how can i and oh how shall i and how shall i ever get home i picked myself up and got into the hall and sat down with my face around next to the wall and my much abused wife began for the ball crying oh how can i and oh how shall i and how shall i ever get home

01:51.608 --> 02:08.672
I then made a lunge and got into the bed, and a very truthful thought came into my head, that the drinking of thrifty would kill me stone dead, crying, oh, how can I, and oh, how shall I, and how shall I ever get home?
