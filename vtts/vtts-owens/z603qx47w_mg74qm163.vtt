00:04.722 --> 00:12.895
Did and again lie still, he said, and he ran across the prairie with a blanket over his head.

00:12.935 --> 00:25.694
Many a time from out of saddle, Utah's held a trailing rope, far to help Lenore at foot feet, for he knew his only hope.

00:26.996 --> 00:32.164
Every boy on the cow range, they all gave a crime.

00:32.515 --> 00:37.641
C.S.A., the boss's daughter, but they knew that he would die.

00:38.903 --> 00:41.906
Many a times that cattle, U.S.A.

00:41.946 --> 00:50.817
held a trailing roll, or to help Lenore at full speed, for he knew his only hope.

00:50.837 --> 00:51.258
U.S.A.

00:51.498 --> 01:01.290
turned maddened cattle from Lenore, his little friend, though the cattle came on rushing, and he stopped to meet his ends.

01:02.384 --> 01:07.451
Quickly then from out of cavern, he used no care his pistol drew.

01:08.032 --> 01:14.461
For he knew he must stop fighting like a cowboy brave and true.

01:14.481 --> 01:24.915
The pistol flashed light lolling, and the report seemed loud and clear, though the cattle came on rushing, and he dropped the leading steer.

01:25.553 --> 01:35.249
The cattle came on rushing and my partner had to fall, never more to saddle a bronco or to give a cattle call.

01:36.731 --> 01:46.667
He died out on the ranges and it seemed most awful hard that I could not reach the distance, not in time to say my part.

01:47.373 --> 01:52.339
Every boy on the cow ranch knew how brave Utah died.

01:52.380 --> 01:58.087
When they passed his grave in silence, they would speak his name with pride.

01:59.228 --> 02:10.343
Went to church next Sunday morning, and I heard the preacher saying that he knew that Utah Carroll would be lost on that great day.
