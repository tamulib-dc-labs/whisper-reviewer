How come that blood on your shirt sleeve, my son? My son, come telling to me.

00:10.860 --> 00:16.653
It is the blood of my own brother dear that works in the fields with me.

00:17.535 --> 00:20.682
What did you kill him for, my son?

00:20.782 --> 00:23.288
My son, come telling to me.

00:23.825 --> 00:30.235
I killed him for cutting yonders bush that might have made a tree.

00:30.876 --> 00:36.744
What will you do when your father comes home, my son, come telling to me?

00:37.425 --> 00:43.735
I'll set my foot on yonder's ship to sail across the sea.

00:44.336 --> 00:49.984
What will you do when your children three, my son, come telling to me?

00:50.639 --> 00:56.626
I'll leave them here with my own mother dear to keep her company.

00:57.447 --> 01:00.411
What will you do with your pretty little wife?

01:00.531 --> 01:02.854
My son come telling to me.

01:03.795 --> 01:09.742
I'll take her by her lily white hand to sail along with me.

01:09.762 --> 01:17.592
When you're coming back to see your children three, my son, come telling to me?

01:17.808 --> 01:20.865
Whenever the sun sets into yonder green hill

01:23.058 --> 01:24.848
And that will never be.
