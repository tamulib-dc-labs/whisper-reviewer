Where is June and July?

00:38.826 --> 00:42.391
Snow time, ain't no time to stay.

00:42.791 --> 00:45.094
I don't spoon.

00:45.114 --> 00:48.078
Shine on, shine on harvest moon.

00:48.098 --> 00:50.822
Now for me, my gal, bring it on.

00:51.202 --> 00:55.088
Shine on, shine on harvest moon.

00:55.208 --> 01:02.958
Up in the sky, I ain't had no loving since April, January, June, and July.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.762
Snow time, ain't no time.

01:09.404 --> 01:14.622
Shine on, shine on harvest moon for me, my gal.

Thank you.
