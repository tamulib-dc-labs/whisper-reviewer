00:02.326 --> 00:04.890
We've met, we've met, says the house.

00:04.950 --> 00:07.735
We've met, we've met, says the house.

00:07.755 --> 00:12.463
We've met, we've met, says the house.

00:12.483 --> 00:22.900
We've met, most joyfully, for I have come across the saltwater sea, and it's all for the sake of the east.

00:24.331 --> 00:54.085
I could have married a king's daughter there She offered marriage to me But I have come across the saltwater sea And it's all for the sake of grief If you could have married a king's daughter there I'm sure you are to blame For I have married a past carpenter And I think he's a nice young man

00:54.622 --> 01:01.611
Oh, won't you forsake your house, carpenter, and go along with me?

01:02.312 --> 01:09.641
I'll take you where the grass grows green, on the banks of the sweet willy.

01:09.661 --> 01:20.595
She took herself into a ring, and dressed in filth most gay, and spread a veil all over her face.

01:20.879 --> 01:29.031
And yet on the glittering day, She had not been saving more than two weeks.

01:29.051 --> 01:38.906
I'm sure it was not great, Till this fair lady set herself to eat, And to wealth most bitterly.

01:39.667 --> 01:43.052
Are you weeping for the house carpenter?

01:44.114 --> 01:46.137
Are you weeping for fear?

01:47.199 --> 01:50.143
Are you weeping for three little baits?

01:50.393 --> 02:17.160
That you left when you come with me here I'm neither a weeping for the house carpenter I'm neither a weeping for here I'm only a weeping for three little days That I left when I come with you here She had not been saving more than three weeks I'm sure it was not for

02:17.461 --> 02:24.813
Tell this prayer lady threw herself overboard, and our morning was heard no more.

02:25.354 --> 02:41.241
He threw himself around three times, while the darkened through the rain, a stranger, dear star, and the night almost you and I.
