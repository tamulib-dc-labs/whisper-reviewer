00:05.042 --> 00:41.817
The Chisholm Trail, sung by Brownie McNeill, Austin, Texas, October 21, 1939. Great granddad.

00:07.832 --> 00:13.478
Now come along, boys, and listen to my tale.

00:13.558 --> 00:15.580
I'll tell you my troubles on the Old Chisholm Trail.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.341
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

00:17.702 --> 00:19.743
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

00:21.505 --> 00:25.669
With a $10 mule and a $50 saddle, I'm a-going out west to punch Texas cattle.

00:25.689 --> 00:27.391
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

00:27.811 --> 00:29.953
Come-a-tie-yee-yippee-yippee-yay.

00:31.469 --> 00:35.676
I started up the trail October 23rd, with a...

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Great-Grandad.

00:45.256 --> 00:50.095
Great-granddad, when the land was young, Barred his door with a wagon tongue, 

00:50.100 --> 00:57.360
For the times were rough and the redskins knocked, And he said his prayers with his shotgun cocked.

00:57.360 --> 01:07.500
He was a citizen tough and grim, Danger was duck soup to him, He ate corn pone and bacon fat, But great-grandson would starve on that.

01:10.906 --> 01:15.493
Twenty-one children came to bless the old man's home in the wilderness.

01:15.873 --> 01:20.520
Doubt this statement if you can, but great-granddad was a busy man.

01:23.304 --> 01:25.467
Twenty-one sons and not one bad.

01:26.969 --> 01:32.998
Great-granddad. For if they had, he'd have been right glad just to tan their hides with a hickory stick.

01:35.510 --> 01:39.294
Twenty-one sons and how they clung...and tall on the bacon too.

01:39.595 --> 01:46.743
Slept on the floor with the dogs and the cats and they hunted in the woods for their coonskin caps.

01:46.763 --> 01:51.489
He raised them rough but he raised them well when their feet took hold on the road to hell.

01:51.509 --> 01:58.277
He filled them full of the fear of God and he straightened them out with his old ramrod.

01:58.763 --> 02:03.273
They grew strong in heart and hand, firm foundation of our land.

02:03.554 --> 02:09.668
Twenty-one sons now his grandson is having a terrible time with one.
