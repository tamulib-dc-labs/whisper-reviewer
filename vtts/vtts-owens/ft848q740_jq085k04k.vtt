00:13.042 --> 00:41.817
Great granddad.

00:45.256 --> 00:55.095
Great-granddad, when the land was young, Bored his door with a wagon tongue, For the times were rough and the redskins knocked, And he said his prayers with his shotgun cocked.

00:57.360 --> 01:07.500
He was a citizen tough and grim, Danger was duck soup to him, He ate corn pone and bacon fat, But great-grandson would starve on that.

01:10.906 --> 01:15.493
Twenty-one children came to bless the old man's home in the wilderness.

01:15.873 --> 01:20.520
Doubt this statement if you can, but great-granddad was a busy man.

01:23.304 --> 01:25.467
Twenty-one sons and not one bad.

01:26.969 --> 01:32.998
Great-granddad, for if they had, he'd have been right glad just to tan their eyes with a hip-hop head.

01:35.510 --> 01:39.294
Twenty-one sons and how they clung and tall on the bacon too.

01:39.595 --> 01:46.743
Slept on the floor with the dogs and the cats and they hunted in the woods for their coonskin caps.

01:46.763 --> 01:51.489
He raised them rough but he raised them well when their feet took hold on the road to hell.

01:51.509 --> 01:58.277
He filled them full of the fear of God and he straightened them out with his old ramrod.

01:58.763 --> 02:03.273
They grew strong in heart and hand, firm foundation of our land.

02:03.554 --> 02:09.668
Twenty-one sons now his grandson is having a terrible time with one.
