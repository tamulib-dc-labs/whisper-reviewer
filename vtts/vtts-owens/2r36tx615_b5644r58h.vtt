00:02.596 --> 00:04.459
The Wicked Daughter.

00:04.479 --> 00:24.975
Young people who don't know I'll tell you what has lately been. A lady who was young and fair, She died in sin and dark despair.

00:25.327 --> 00:35.927
She went to parties, both dance and play, in spite of all her parents could say.

00:43.467 --> 00:46.112
I'll turn to God when I get old, and then he will receive my soul.

00:47.033 --> 00:51.261
One Friday morning she was taken ill.

00:51.822 --> 00:56.910
Her stubborn heart began to yield.

00:58.213 --> 01:02.440
Alas, alas, my days are spent.

01:02.961 --> 01:07.669
Too late to go now to repent.

01:08.105 --> 01:33.977
She called her mother to her bed. Her eyes were rolling in her head. When I am dead remember well, Your wicked daughter screams in hell. Earth laughs all there fare thee well

01:34.227 --> 02:00.910
My soul is lost and doomed to hell. Those hellish flames they round me roll. Oh, I'm a lost and ruined soul. She gnawed her tongue before she died. She wrung her hands and screamed and cried.

02:01.126 --> 02:22.830
Oh, must I burn forevermore Ten thousand years all o'er and o'er. Young people now, both great and small Take warning by my dying words

02:27.097 --> 02:31.217
For if you wait till it's too late, You may expect this awful day.
