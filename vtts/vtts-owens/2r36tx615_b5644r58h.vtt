The Wicked Daughter.

00:04.479 --> 00:24.975
Young people who don't know I'll tell you what has lately been Lady who was young and fair She died in sin and dark despair

00:25.327 --> 00:35.927
She went to parties, both dance and play, in spite of all her friends could say.

00:43.467 --> 00:46.112
Will receive my soul.

00:47.033 --> 00:51.261
One Friday morning she'll take a kneel.

00:51.822 --> 00:56.910
Her stubborn heart began to yield.

00:58.213 --> 01:02.440
Elas, elas, my days are spent.

01:02.961 --> 01:07.669
Too late to go now to repent.

01:08.105 --> 01:33.977
She called her mother to her bed Her eyes were rolling in her head When I am dead remember well Your wicked doctor screams in hell Earth laughs all there fare thee well

01:34.227 --> 02:00.910
My soul is lost and doomed to hell Those hellish flames they round me roll Oh, I'm a lost and ruined soul She gnawed her tongue before she died She wrung her hands and screamed and cried

02:01.126 --> 02:22.830
Oh, must I burn forevermore Ten thousand years older and o'er Young people now, both great and small Take warning by my dying words

02:27.097 --> 02:31.217
You may expect this awful day.
