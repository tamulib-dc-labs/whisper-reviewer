00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
By and by, I wait for you to come. All the saints of God gathering home.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.983
We will tell the story how we'll overcome.

00:30.777 --> 00:35.103
And we'll understand it's better by and by.

00:35.123 --> 00:40.870
We are often destituted of the things that life demands.

00:41.471 --> 00:45.937
Water of our food, hills and barren land.

00:46.378 --> 00:52.666
And I wonder why the test when we try to do our best.

00:52.686 --> 00:57.833
And we'll understand it's better by and by.

00:57.853 --> 01:00.396
Oh, by and by, I wait for you to come. 

01:00.396 --> 01:16.000
We will tell the story how we'll overcome.

01:16.947 --> 01:21.712
We'll understand if there are by and by.

01:21.732 --> 01:33.365
The cry is dark on every hand and we cannot understand all the ways that God will lead us to his blessed promised land.

01:33.866 --> 01:39.732
He will guide us with his eye and we'll follow till we die.

01:40.066 --> 01:47.116
And we'll understand it better by and by.

01:48.438 --> 01:54.747
By and by, I wait for you to come. 

01:54.767 --> 01:57.451
All the saints of God gathering home.

01:57.471 --> 02:04.000
We will tell the story how we'll overcome.

02:04.020 --> 02:08.166
And we'll understand it better by and by.

02:11.082 --> 02:20.360
When morning comes, all the saints of God gathering home.

02:20.380 --> 02:26.652
And we will tell the story how we overcome.

02:27.314 --> 02:31.622
And we'll understand it there by and by.
