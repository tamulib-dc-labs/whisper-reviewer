Will you marry me as only unfair in the leg dimming his handsome hair?

00:16.577 --> 00:20.807
Will you give me the one great wish of my life?

00:21.057 --> 00:49.528
The joy of calling you mine, my wife I have not the gift of eloquent words No more than the merry twittering bird But my dear Ethel will tell the tale That my lips in speaking must always fail And I thought of Leon in his humble home

00:49.508 --> 01:17.136
His pride, his race, his wife, his own Of his mother busy with the cares of life Waiting to welcome Leon's wife And I thought of Claude in his handsome home His noble race, his handsome face Of the dresses fine and jewels rare

01:17.521 --> 01:44.119
That I as wife would surely wear And all the blessings and goodies of my life Went out of my heart on this starry night And I answered no in spite of life's woe And Leon's left me alone, alone Heaven's curse rests on your head

01:44.723 --> 02:14.022
leon's dying mother said and that curse has followed me overland and overseas 30 years i've been called wise 30 years of toil and stride 30 years of grief and sorrow 30 weary years tomorrow

02:14.626 --> 02:44.295
On a distant battlefield With none to protect and none to shield Lee undied with no kind hand To cheer him in that far-off land On his breast it found my face Smiling in its girlish grave Under the velvet lining of blue

02:44.748 --> 02:48.801
Until the lassie still walks through
