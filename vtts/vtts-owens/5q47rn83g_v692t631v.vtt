00:02.748 --> 00:07.617
King of England.

00:07.637 --> 00:11.304
Oh, the minstrel sing of an English king that lived long years ago.

00:11.665 --> 00:15.212
He ruled his land with an iron hand, but his mind was weak and low.

00:16.595 --> 00:20.201
He loved to shag the bounding stag that lived in the royal wood.

00:20.542 --> 00:25.752
He also was exceedingly fond of pulling the royal foot.

00:27.065 --> 00:30.789
Now the queen of Spain was an amorous queen and an amorous queen was she.

00:31.090 --> 00:34.553
She loved to fool with the mighty tool of the king across the sea.

00:35.875 --> 00:43.183
She sent a special message by a special messenger to ask the king to come and spend a month or two with her.

00:45.466 --> 00:52.954
Now the king of France he peed in his pants and he said to all his court, the queen prefers my rival because my tool is short.

00:54.031 --> 01:01.621
He sent the duke a slipper slap to give the queen a dose of claps, and God save the pastor king of England.

01:05.166 --> 01:12.435
When the news of the Espalde was known in dear old Windsor Hall, the king he swore by the shirt he wore he'd have the Frenchman fall.

01:12.816 --> 01:20.646
He offered half a kingdom and a piece of Queen Hortense to any man who'd crossed the sea and not the king of France.

01:21.740 --> 01:25.405
The Duke O'Shea, he galloped away, straight to the shores of France.

01:25.705 --> 01:30.371
He swore he was a fluter, and the king took down his pants.

01:30.391 --> 01:37.960
To the royal prong, he tied a thong, he jumped on his horse and galloped along, back to the faster king of England.

01:40.023 --> 01:47.612
Now the king puked up his breakfast, and he shit up on the floor, for in that ride the princeman's pride had stretched a yard or more.

01:48.470 --> 01:55.984
And when this sight was seen in dear old London town, the women, they all shouted to hell with the English crown.

01:57.066 --> 02:05.162
The Frenchman king usurped the throne, his scepter was his mighty bone, with which he crowned the faster king of England.
