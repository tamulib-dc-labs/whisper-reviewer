00:00.537 --> 00:16.297
As I walked out on one morning for pleasure, I spied a cowpuncher all riding along.

00:17.698 --> 00:26.622
His head was thrown back and his spurs were a-jinglin' and as he approached me, he was singing this song.

00:27.553 --> 00:35.799
Yippee-ki-yi-yo, get along little dogies. It's your misfortune and none of my own.

00:37.021 --> 00:40.746
Yippee-ki-yi-yo, get along little dogies.

00:40.766 --> 00:48.296
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

00:48.316 --> 00:51.901
It's early in the spring that we round up the dogies.

00:51.921 --> 00:56.428
We mark them and brand them and bob off their tails.

00:56.508 --> 01:00.193
We round up the horses, load up the chuck wagons.

01:01.523 --> 01:05.808
Then throw the little dogies out on the long trail.

01:07.509 --> 01:11.113
Yippee-ki-yi-yo, get along little dogies.

01:11.133 --> 01:16.539
It's your misfortune and none of my own.

01:16.559 --> 01:20.063
Yippee-ki-yi-yo, get along little dogies.

01:20.123 --> 01:26.890
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

01:27.359 --> 01:35.416
Now some boys go up the trail for pleasure, but that's where they get it most awfully wrong.

01:36.318 --> 01:45.418
For you haven't any idea the trouble they give us as we go a-driving the dogies along.

01:46.124 --> 01:54.176
Yippee-ki-yi-yo, get along little dogies, it's your misfortune and none of my own.

01:55.077 --> 02:03.209
Yippee-ki-yi-yo, get along little dogies, you know that Wyoming will be your new home.

02:05.913 --> 02:15.287
Your mother was raised away down in Texas where the jimson weed and the sand-burrs grow.

02:15.723 --> 02:24.356
But now we will fill on prickly and cholla till you are ready for Idaho.

02:27.941 --> 02:34.633
Yippee-ki-yi-yo, get along little dogies, it's your misfortune and none of my own.

02:34.633 --> 02:42.781
Yippee-ki-yi-yo, get along little dogies, you know that Wyoming will be your new home.
