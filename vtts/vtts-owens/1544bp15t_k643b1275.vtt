00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[Silence.]

00:01.246 --> 00:26.207
Steal away, steal away, to Jesus, steal away. 

00:32.296 --> 00:41.624
Steal away, oh, I ain't got long to stay, steal away.

00:47.610 --> 01:00.141
Steal away, steal away, to Jesus, steal away.

01:00.261 --> 01:18.397
Steal away, oh, I'm going to the Lord today.

01:18.417 --> 01:28.890
My Lord told me, He called me back to my love.

01:29.551 --> 01:37.521
The tapita within my soul.

01:37.872 --> 01:46.244
I ain't got long to stay.

01:47.626 --> 01:52.133
Steal away.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.857
Steal away.

01:56.579 --> 01:58.703
Steal away to Jesus.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.753
Steal away

02:07.055 --> 02:07.255
Steal away

02:07.454 --> 02:33.394
He always comes, I ain't got long to stay. Green trees are bending, poor sinners stand a-trembling.

02:33.627 --> 02:50.809
The trumpet sounds within my soul, I ain't got long to stay.
