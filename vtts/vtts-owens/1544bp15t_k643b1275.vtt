00:01.246 --> 00:26.207
Feel our way Feel our way To give up Feel our way

00:32.296 --> 00:41.624
I ain't got home today.

00:43.766 --> 00:45.008
Feel away.

00:45.028 --> 00:45.388
Feel away.

00:47.610 --> 01:00.141
Feel away to who you are.

01:00.261 --> 01:00.902
Feel away.

01:07.784 --> 01:18.397
I am the Lord today.

01:18.417 --> 01:28.890
My Lord told me, He called me back to my love.

01:29.551 --> 01:37.521
The tapita within my soul.

01:37.872 --> 01:46.244
I ain't got love to say.

01:47.626 --> 01:52.133
Fill away.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.857
Fill away.

01:56.579 --> 01:58.703
Fill away.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.753
Fill away.

02:06.834 --> 02:07.035
Blue diva.

02:07.055 --> 02:07.255
Fill away.

02:07.454 --> 02:33.394
He always comes I ain't allowed to say Drink me the bimbi Worth me enough than a damn lake

02:33.627 --> 02:50.809
Though tropical within my soul I gallantly say it
