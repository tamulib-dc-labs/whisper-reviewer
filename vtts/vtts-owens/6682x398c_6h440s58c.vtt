00:01.027 --> 00:28.857
Oh, Cindy.

00:32.515 --> 00:36.680
Thought I had my Sunday, say I'm welcome my boy.

00:37.421 --> 00:41.846
I teach it like a terry, I carry it like a roll.

00:42.046 --> 00:49.856
Tell my child I'm a Sunday, and nobody knows.

00:49.876 --> 00:51.658
And one long home Sunday, and one long home Sunday.

00:51.678 --> 00:56.143
And one long home Sunday, way down in North Japan.
