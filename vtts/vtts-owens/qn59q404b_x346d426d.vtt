There were three crows, sung by Stanley Ezra.

00:12.480 --> 00:12.841

00:12.861 --> 00:20.911

00:34.234 --> 00:47.554
And they all flopped their wings and cried, says one old crow unto his mate, old Billy McGee McGaw.

00:48.142 --> 00:54.408

00:54.909 --> 01:00.694

01:00.854 --> 01:13.727

And they all flopped their wings and cried, ow, ow, ow.

01:33.873 --> 01:40.040
We'll perch ourselves on his backbone, oh Billy McGee McGaw.

01:40.641 --> 01:46.587
We'll perch ourselves on his backbone, oh Billy McGee McGaw.

01:47.008 --> 01:50.772
We'll perch ourselves on his backbone and eat.

01:53.935 --> 01:56.438
Oh, boys, what their wings and crotch.
