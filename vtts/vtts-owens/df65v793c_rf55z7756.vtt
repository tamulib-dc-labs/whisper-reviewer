00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
[Silence.]

00:15.000 --> 00:28.474
There is a wonderful invention. It is called the radio.

00:28.474 --> 00:47.913
You can hear it all, every place you call. But the static in the air makes it sometimes hard to hear.

00:47.913 --> 01:00.000
But it is not so with heaven's radio.

01:00.000--> 01:23.903
Heaven's radio On the other shore Where my precious Savior listens in. There's no static in the air

01:25.250 --> 01:37.740
And it never needs repair But my precious savior listens in.

01:42.698 --> 02:04.133
When your burdens bring you down Almost level with the ground. Broadcast unto Jesus, he's listening in

02:08.534 --> 02:21.683
He will give you courage new and will lead you bravely through, for my precious Savior listens in.
