00:26.474 --> 00:46.913
You can hear it all, every place you call But the static in the air makes it sometimes for two

00:57.727 --> 01:23.903
On the other shore Where my precious Savior listens in There's no static in the air

01:25.250 --> 01:37.740
And it never needs repair But my precious savior

01:42.698 --> 02:04.133
When your burdens bring you down Almost level with the ground George has come to be, but keep listening in

02:08.534 --> 02:21.683
Oh
