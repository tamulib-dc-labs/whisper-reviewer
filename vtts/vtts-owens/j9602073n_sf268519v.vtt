00:03.406 --> 00:32.164
Fair Fanny Moor.

00:32.347 --> 00:38.173
One offered his riches, and he offered his fame.

00:38.193 --> 00:49.303
His fame and his riches both failed to allure the thong-burning bosom of the Farf and the Moor.

00:50.044 --> 00:54.208
The next was young Edward, a man of prodigree.

00:54.729 --> 00:59.333
He offered his heart, and raptured was he.

00:59.617 --> 01:10.574
And straightway to the altar, he quickly did secure the heart and the hand of the fair Fanny Moore.

01:11.636 --> 01:20.690
When Fanny was sitting in her cottage one day, business had called her found husband away.

01:20.730 --> 01:26.839
Young Ragnar, the old day, he opened the door.

01:27.022 --> 01:31.889
And clasped to his bosom the fair fanny moor.

01:32.570 --> 01:37.277
O raniel, o raniel, o raniel, she cried.

01:37.758 --> 01:39.901
Does sparrow spare me?

01:40.382 --> 01:42.685
She wrung her hands and cried.

01:43.426 --> 01:48.934
O fanny lov'r fanny, go to your land of rest.

01:48.954 --> 01:54.042
And it plunged a dagger through her snowy white breast.

01:55.152 --> 01:59.818
While Fanny was bleeding in her bloodstain she died.

02:00.399 --> 02:05.225
Young Edward was taken and straightway was tried.

02:05.986 --> 02:10.772
And hung upon the willow by the side of the door.

02:11.333 --> 02:16.199
For shedding the blood of the sarif and the moor.

02:16.860 --> 02:22.227
Young Edward the shepherd went distracted and wild.

02:22.647 --> 02:24.670
He roamed around a while.

02:24.920 --> 02:30.377
On his own made a sign that laid clear as they could.

02:30.798 --> 02:38.322
From his own cottage door and laid down side of the grass and the moor.
