I will give you a short history of the Ben Thompson banjo, which I now hold in my hand.

00:09.157 --> 00:21.395
Back in the early 70s, Ben Thompson, a Texas noted character, was in Mexico in a gambling house and got involved in a scrape with a Mexican and killed him.

00:22.176 --> 00:23.238
And they put him in jail.

00:23.879 --> 00:24.840
President Diaz

00:25.175 --> 00:36.909
A friend of Ben Thompson, next morning when he found his friend was in jail, he pardoned him out and presented him with a banjo, knowing that Ben Thompson was a good banjo player.

00:36.929 --> 00:48.343
Ben brought the banjo back, and I as a boy played on this banjo and taught his daughter, Katie, how to play green corn.

00:48.363 --> 00:53.849
Years went by, and after Ben's death, Mrs. Thompson pawned the banjo with J.A.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.131
Jackson's pawn shop

00:55.685 --> 01:00.871
I passed along and recognized the banjo through its case and bought it.

01:00.892 --> 01:02.854
And I now have the Ben Thompson banjo.

01:03.655 --> 01:04.436
I am J.D.

01:04.476 --> 01:10.824
Dillingham of Austin, Texas, and will play you Green Corn, the tune that I learned Katie Thompson to play.

01:21.177 --> 01:21.718
Just a moment.

01:21.738 --> 01:22.619
I'm all out of tune.

01:22.799 --> 01:23.700
Step shut it off, thanks.

01:31.072 --> 01:32.779
Thank you.

01:45.837 --> 01:48.902
Oh, stand still, stand still.

01:48.943 --> 01:49.904
There's no time for running.

01:49.924 --> 01:52.609
If you look up on the hillsides, you must come and run.

01:52.629 --> 01:54.573
And will the strings are going to lead you on the level.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.378
Tell you, boy, if you don't mind, you're going to get the devil.

01:57.698 --> 01:58.620
Bring on, bring on, bring on.

01:58.700 --> 02:04.049
Oh, my lady, girl, don't forget the hot corn.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.073
Oh, my lady.

02:06.205 --> 02:09.250
Oh, here's the cat to chase the rat from the table to the sack.

02:09.270 --> 02:11.373
Stack the peel upon its back of the yellow girl and top of that.

02:11.513 --> 02:13.917
Bring on, bring along, bring on your dingy john.

02:13.937 --> 02:20.027
Oh, my little girl, don't forget the hot corn.

02:21.188 --> 02:22.290
Oh, stand up.
