[Static.]

00:06.000 --> 00:17.000
[Music.]

00:17.000 --> 00:25.988
It may be the best for me,

00:28.145 --> 00:35.192
it may be the best for me.

00:36.173 --> 00:53.832
My Lord knows the way, and I'll obey, cause it may be the best for me.

00:54.098 --> 01:10.637
I often wonder why it is that some are so happy and free.

01:11.358 --> 01:20.308
While my head bowed and my soul oppressed,

01:20.693 --> 01:30.046
Yet it may be the best for me.

01:30.066 --> 01:37.296
It may be the best for me.

01:37.316 --> 01:42.263
It may be the best

01:42.462 --> 01:45.907
for me.

01:47.149 --> 02:04.252
My Lord knows the way, and I'll obey, cause it may be the best for me.

02:04.272 --> 02:08.959
There are some as parents

02:09.125 --> 02:20.657
There at home, while mine are gone, and I'm left all alone.

02:21.218 --> 02:36.634
But I'll drop my law till the judgment's morn, cause it may be the best for me.
