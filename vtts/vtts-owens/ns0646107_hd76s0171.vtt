00:03.170 --> 00:09.078
The Santa Fe Trail, played by Brownie McNeill at Austin, Texas, February 18, 1939.

00:09.298 --> 00:20.433
Say, have you sighted a schooner alongside of the Santa Fe Trail?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.998
They made it here Monday or sooner.

00:24.599 --> 00:28.564
They had a water keg tied on the tail.

00:28.584 --> 00:31.708
There was Daddy and Ma on the mule seat.

00:32.296 --> 00:43.698
And somewhere along by the way was a tow-headed gal on a pinto, just a janglin' for old Santa Fe.

00:43.698 --> 00:54.338
Yo-ho, just a janglin' for old Santa Fe.

00:55.786 --> 01:03.233
I seen her ride down the arroyo, way back on the Arkansas sands.

01:03.533 --> 01:11.020
She had a smile like an acre of sunflowers, and a quirt in her little brown hand.

01:11.380 --> 01:25.793
She mounted her pinto so at ease, she rode like she carried the mail, and her eyes near set fire to the prairie, alongside of the Santa Fe trail.

01:25.773 --> 01:31.392
Yo-ho, alongside of the Santa Fe

01:31.392 --> 01:58.581
I know a gal down on the border That'd ride to El Paso to sight. I'm acquainted with the high-flying orders And I sometimes kiss some gals goodnight. But, Lord, they're all fluffers and beaded

01:58.561 --> 02:02.096
Drink afternoon tea by the pail.

02:02.518 --> 02:08.402
I'm not used to that sort of stampeding alongside of the Santa Fe trail. Yo-ho, alongside of the Santa Fe.

02:15.115 --> 02:33.850
Now I don't know her name on the prairie When you're hunting one gal it's so wine. It's shorter from hell to hilarie

02:33.830 --> 02:37.800
than it is on the Santa Fe ride.

02:37.900 --> 02:45.298
So I'll try to make plumbers by sundown where a camp can be made on the swale.

02:45.559 --> 02:48.867
I'll come on that gal with her pinto.

02:49.248 --> 02:51.754
She'll be camped on the Santa Fe trail.
