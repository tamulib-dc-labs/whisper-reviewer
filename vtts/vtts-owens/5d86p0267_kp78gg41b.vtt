00:13.312 --> 00:16.875
Every night I feel the same.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.893
I will pray.

00:24.473 --> 00:29.440
Up on this mountain, my Lord first.

00:30.081 --> 00:34.987
Out of his mountain, far as more.

00:35.527 --> 00:40.474
Look all around me, it looks so fine.

00:41.195 --> 00:45.360
I ask young Jesus, if all was mine.

00:47.298 --> 01:13.626
Every time I feel the Spirit moving in my heart I will pray Every time I feel the Spirit moving in my heart It ain't but one thing that I've done wrong

01:13.859 --> 01:19.426
I stayed in need of little to love.

01:19.446 --> 01:23.892
I was so saved on what he said.

01:24.633 --> 01:29.680
So I can do my mouth as well.

01:30.361 --> 01:40.294
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

01:41.035 --> 01:43.258
Every time I...

01:43.357 --> 01:51.223
Feel the spirit moving in thy heart, I will pray.
