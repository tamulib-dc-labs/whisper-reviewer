00:03.102 --> 00:09.012
The Zebra Dun, played by Brownie MacNeil at Austin, Texas, February 19, 1939.

00:11.697 --> 00:15.624
We were camped upon the Pecos at the head of the Cimarron.

00:15.924 --> 00:19.631
But along there comes a stranger, and he stops to argue some.

00:19.992 --> 00:23.538
He looked so very foolish, we begin to look around.

00:23.858 --> 00:28.266
For we thought he was a greenhorn that had just escaped from town.

00:29.191 --> 00:32.740
We asked he'd been to breakfast and he hadn't had a smear.

00:33.041 --> 00:36.610
So he opened up the chuck wagon and bade him have his share.

00:36.891 --> 00:46.035
He took a piece of steak, some biscuits and some beans, and then began to tell his tale of foreign kings and queens.

00:46.015 --> 00:54.034
About the Spanish wars and fighting on the seas, with cannons big as steers and ramrods big as trees.

00:54.415 --> 01:02.033
About Paul Jones, an old fighting son of a gun, who was the grittiest cause that ever pulled a gun.

01:03.278 --> 01:06.965
Now such an educated feller, his thoughts just came and hurt.

01:07.266 --> 01:11.054
He tickled the boys to death with his jaw-breaking words.

01:11.074 --> 01:14.601
He just kept on a-talking till he made the boys all sick.

01:14.942 --> 01:19.110
And they began to look around just how to play a trick.

01:20.693 --> 01:27.825
He said he'd lost his job down on the Santa Fe, and he was going across the plains to strike the Seven-D.

01:28.686 --> 01:36.559
He didn't say how come it's some trouble with the boss, but he said he'd like to borrow a nice fat saddle horse.

01:37.703 --> 01:39.427
This tickled the boys to death.

01:39.628 --> 01:41.593
They laughed down in their sleeves.

01:41.613 --> 01:45.463
Oh, we will lend you a saddle horse just nice and fat as you please.

01:45.483 --> 01:48.912
Oh, sure, he grabbed the lariat and roped the zebra dun.

01:49.092 --> 01:53.704
Turned him over to the stranger and we waited for the fun.

01:55.068 --> 01:58.758
Now, Dunny was an outlaw that had grown so awful wild.

01:58.998 --> 02:02.608
He could fall the white out of the moon whenever he got riled.

02:02.949 --> 02:11.271
Old Dunny stood right still just as if he didn't know until he was saddled and ready for the go.

02:11.690 --> 02:19.501
When the stranger hit the saddle, old Dunny quit the earth, and traveled right straight up for all that he was worth.

02:19.901 --> 02:27.772
A pitchin' and a squealin' and a havin' walleyed fits, his hind feet perpendicular, his front ones in the fits.

02:28.974 --> 02:32.719
We could see the tops of mountains under Dunny every jump.

02:32.952 --> 02:36.544
The stranger he was grown there just like a camel's hump.

02:36.825 --> 02:40.478
The stranger sat upon him and curled his black mustache.

02:40.779 --> 02:45.375
Just like a summer boarder a-waiting for his hash.
