00:05.920 --> 00:08.425
Why does your sword drift with blood?

00:08.766 --> 00:12.273
Edward, Edward, why does your sword drift with blood?

00:12.293 --> 00:18.807
And why does that go ye home?

00:22.234 --> 00:25.380
Oh, I have killed my horse, my God, evermore.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.464
Edward, Edward, your hawk's blood was not red.

00:39.725 --> 00:46.353
My dear son, I tell thee, no.

00:46.373 --> 00:50.759
No, I have killed my red wrong seed.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.603
Smither, smither.

00:53.683 --> 00:57.348
Oh, I have killed my red wrong seed.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.592
That was apparent to me.

01:01.133 --> 01:02.775
No, your seed was old.

01:03.042 --> 01:06.928
Oh, I have killed my father, dear.

01:06.948 --> 01:09.131
Oh, I have killed my father, dear.

01:11.174 --> 01:15.880
Oh, I have killed my father, dear.

01:18.123 --> 01:22.249
Oh, I have killed my father, dear.

01:22.730 --> 01:28.358
Oh, it's me.

01:38.159 --> 01:41.665
Edward, Edward, what penance will you do for that?

01:42.106 --> 01:43.609
My dear son, now tell me.

01:46.834 --> 01:52.044
I'll set my foot in yonder boat, mither, mither.

01:52.064 --> 01:59.076
I'll set my foot in yonder boat, and I'll fare o'er the sea.

02:00.298 --> 02:02.462
Oh.

02:03.387 --> 02:06.131
What will you do with your Tarleton Hall, Edward, Edward?

02:06.411 --> 02:09.195
And what will you do with your Tarleton Hall?

02:09.736 --> 02:16.925
That world serves well to see, oh.

02:16.945 --> 02:24.215
I let them stand till they don't fall.

02:24.235 --> 02:26.138
May them fall.

02:32.497 --> 02:49.577
Let him run, till they shall fall, till they shall fall, till they shall fall, till they shall fall.
