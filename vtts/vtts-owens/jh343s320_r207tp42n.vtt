Cowboy Jack.

00:05.230 --> 00:15.339
Jack was just a lonely cowboy with a heart so brave and true.

00:15.359 --> 00:23.407
He learned to love a maiden with eyes of heaven's blue.

00:24.688 --> 00:28.531
They learned to love each other.

00:29.492 --> 00:34.017
They named their wedding day.

00:34.017 --> 00:41.790
When a quarrel came between them, and Jackie rode away. 

00:41.790 --> 00:52.259
He joined a band of cowboys, he tried to forget her name.

00:52.259 --> 01:00.832
Out on the lonely prairie, she wait for him the same.

01:01.653 --> 01:10.566
When life began his singing, his mind wandered back.

01:10.586 --> 01:18.958
He was singing of the maiden who was waiting for her Jack.

01:19.394 --> 01:26.327
Your sweetheart wait for you Jack. Your sweetheart wait for you. 

01:26.400 --> 01:35.000
Out on the lonely prairie where the skies are always blue.
