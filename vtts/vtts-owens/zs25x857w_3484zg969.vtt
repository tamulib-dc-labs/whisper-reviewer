00:01.735 --> 00:02.797
Bye-bye, my darling.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.100
Bye-bye, my darling.

00:05.360 --> 00:11.389
I must leave you one sweet kiss before I go.

00:11.409 --> 00:17.018
I'll be back next Sunday night if I cannot come out right.

00:17.478 --> 00:20.944
Just a word to do to let my darling know.

00:21.585 --> 00:30.578
He has teeth as white as pearl and such darling little pearl and his name which I call her every day.

00:30.997 --> 00:39.708
He's the joy of my life, and I hope to be his wife, and these words which I'll never hear again.

00:40.468 --> 00:48.378
Bye-bye, my darling, I must leave you one sweet kiss before I go.

00:49.059 --> 00:53.664
I'll be back next Sunday night if I cannot come, all right.

00:53.985 --> 00:57.409
Just a word to let my darling know.
