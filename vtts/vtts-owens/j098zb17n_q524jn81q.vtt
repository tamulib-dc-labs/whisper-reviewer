This is David Rice singing a song he learned from his father, Benjamin F. Rice, that he learned over 50 years ago.

00:11.617 --> 00:17.989
The date today is May the 5th, June the 5th, 1939.

00:19.522 --> 00:28.416
Twas a cold stormy night in winter, and the wind blew across the wild moor.

00:28.456 --> 00:39.994
For Mary came along with a babe in her arms, and she stood by her own father's door.

00:39.974 --> 01:00.362
Oh, father, dear father, she cried, come down, please, and open the door, or the babe in my arms will perish and die by the wind that sweeps o'er the wild moor.

01:01.574 --> 01:11.131
The old man being deep to her cries, not one sound of her voice reached his ear.

01:12.313 --> 01:23.953
But the dogs they did bark, and the village bells told by the wind that sweeps o'er the wild moor.

01:23.933 --> 01:33.829
Oh, what did the old man think when he came to the door in the morn?

01:34.870 --> 01:46.228
Poor Mary was dead, but the babe's still alive, closely pressed in this dead mother's arms.

01:46.208 --> 02:11.727
The old man in grief and way And there they drew his mother went soon And no one, they say, has lived there till this day And the cottage to ruin has gone The villagers part of the spot

02:11.707 --> 02:27.150
where the willows droop over the door saying there married I'd want to get a lit bride by the wind that sweeps o'er the wild moor
