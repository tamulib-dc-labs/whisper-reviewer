00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Boys in Blue.

00:05.971 --> 00:10.080
There was an old man, and he was bent with age. 

00:11.462 --> 00:18.946
He landed in this village...

00:19.686 --> 00:21.909
Is this an express office, sir?

00:22.510 --> 00:25.273
I'm looking for my son.

00:25.873 --> 00:32.721
They tell me that his plane was due at this place at half-past one.

00:33.342 --> 00:42.053
Oh, you have made a sad mistake, I'd like to let you know.

00:42.113 --> 00:48.302
This is an express office, sir, and not a train depot.

00:49.743 --> 00:56.312
Oh, you don't understand me, sir, with trembling words he said.

00:56.832 --> 01:04.932
Not coming as a passenger but coming to me dead. 

01:05.000 --> 01:20.000
Just in the whistle pierced the air. The express someone cried. And the tears the old man shed As it quickly passed outside. 

01:20.000 --> 01:25.283
A casket in a long white box

01:25.283 --> 01:35.403
Was buried to the ground And the tears on every face As they quickly gathered around. 

01:35.403 --> 01:44.000
Don't handle him so roughly boy for that is my darling Jack?

01:45.064 --> 01:52.692
He went away as you are now, See how he's coming back.

01:53.414 --> 02:01.876
He's gone and broke his mother's heart...

02:01.896 --> 02:09.195
She told him he would come back dead, if he joined those boys in blue.
