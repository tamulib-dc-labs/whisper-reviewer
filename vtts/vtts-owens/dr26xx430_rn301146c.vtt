00:05.971 --> 00:14.080
Oh, man, when he was in the face, he landed in this village.

00:15.462 --> 00:18.946
The factor just was late.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.909
Is this an express officer?

00:22.510 --> 00:25.273
I'm looking for my son.

00:25.873 --> 00:32.721
They tell me that a thing you did is late at a place once.

00:33.342 --> 00:42.053
Oh, you have made a sad mistake, I'd like to let you know.

00:42.113 --> 00:48.302
This is an express officer, and not a train depot.

00:49.743 --> 00:56.312
Oh, you don't understand me, sir, with family words he said.

00:56.832 --> 01:24.932
Not coming as a passenger Not coming to me dead Just in the whistle face of air To express someone's cry And the tears in a woman shed As it quickly passed outside A casket in a long white ball

01:25.283 --> 01:44.403
Was buried to the ground And the tears on every face As they quickly gathered around Don't handle him so roughly boy What is my darling joy?

01:45.064 --> 01:52.692
He went away as you are now See how he's coming back

01:53.414 --> 02:01.876
He's almost broke his mother's heart like white man's open tooth.

02:01.896 --> 02:09.195
She told him he would come like that, spring on white and blue.
