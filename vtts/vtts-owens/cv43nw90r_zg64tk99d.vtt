00:09.802 --> 00:22.014
We are happy to have with us tonight Mr. Owens and a group of faculty members and students from A&M College and a group of white friends of this city.

00:22.034 --> 00:34.225
They are here to record the music of our fathers and we take this opportunity to say to them from the very bottom of our hearts that they are welcome here among us.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.969
We do trust that in the future

00:39.772 --> 00:48.865
of our fathers will not be used for blues and other types of desecrated music.

00:49.746 --> 01:00.582
These are days when men need to know God and not to use those things that are sacrilegiously.

01:00.950 --> 01:19.636
We are thankful that these members of one of the finest educational institutions in the South have left their work aside to come among us to give our own sacred music a proper place in the arts of America.

01:20.998 --> 01:27.227
We trust also that our people will have the proper appreciation

01:27.697 --> 01:36.875
for this type of true Christian spirit, Mr. Owens, by making this their second visit here among us.

01:37.676 --> 01:46.313
Above all other things, Mr. Owens, and to our good friends, we sincerely offer to you a very hearty welcome.
