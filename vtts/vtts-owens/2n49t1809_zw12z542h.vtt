00:02.933 --> 00:07.904
Why shouldn't I believe in a hand?

00:09.186 --> 00:18.646
Lord have mercy, I've seen enough of them down here.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.853
When have I seen a hand?

00:22.475 --> 00:26.719
Well, just day before yesterday, I was down here hunting with my dog.

00:27.100 --> 00:29.302
He threw the squirrel, I can see him right now.

00:30.023 --> 00:38.351
You know a bar tree, there's a leaf on that tree, a bar limb, and that old red-eyed squirrel looking over the limb.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.695
I see them red eyes, I can't pay no attention to them red eyes.

00:42.035 --> 00:44.738
I just level down on him, I let go right towards his eyes.

00:45.138 --> 00:48.982
Shuts, I ain't missed nothing since I was 12 years old in my 22.

00:49.963 --> 00:51.064
No, I ain't.

00:51.618 --> 00:58.649
And me and that dog walk around and around that tree for half, 15 minutes looking for that there squirrel.

00:59.430 --> 01:00.832
There wasn't no squirrel there.

01:01.373 --> 01:02.255
All of a sudden I stop.

01:02.695 --> 01:03.256
I see myself.

01:03.837 --> 01:05.400
That there squirrel was a hang.

01:06.261 --> 01:08.084
Oh, glory, I come on out there, too.

01:08.104 --> 01:11.749
I ain't been back down that bottom since, no, sir.

01:11.769 --> 01:12.791
Oh, just I believe in hains.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.133
I've seen plenty of hains.

01:14.153 --> 01:17.138
You know them two fellas what was drownded down here?

01:17.819 --> 01:19.802
Well, thems ain't still down here.

01:20.187 --> 01:24.193
Of course, there's, you can see them right now every day, every night down here.

01:24.753 --> 01:26.756
Or you can run into them almost every night.

01:27.317 --> 01:29.780
That's me, I don't fish on this part of the river no more.

01:30.321 --> 01:34.066
No, because they put these hate catfish on your line.

01:34.086 --> 01:36.029
Of course, you do, you hear them ringing your bell.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.375
You hear them ringing your bell, and he goes out there, and there ain't no catfish there.

01:40.395 --> 01:45.402
And you know, you know, that, that, that, that, that, that man, what was drowned down here, them.

01:45.753 --> 01:47.756
Me and my wife had them just the other night.

01:48.136 --> 01:49.458
We had the motor running.

01:49.758 --> 01:51.541
We had them stop right outside the gate.

01:52.041 --> 01:54.445
We had the chain draper on the latch of the gate.

01:55.005 --> 01:58.050
We had the gate creak and sag.

01:58.750 --> 02:01.234
We had them come on through there.

02:02.195 --> 02:06.120
My wife said, get up and see who got out there.

02:06.821 --> 02:07.642
I said, I got them.

02:07.662 --> 02:08.283
I'll walk out there.

02:08.564 --> 02:10.006
They wanted nobody out there.

02:10.506 --> 02:11.167
They wanted nothing.

02:11.187 --> 02:12.188
The gate was shut.

02:12.209 --> 02:13.330
The lock was locked.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.149
You don't believe in Hayes.

02:16.169 --> 02:17.617
You don't believe in Hayes.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.185
You don't believe in Hayes.

02:19.587 --> 02:21.497
I just feel sorry for you there.
