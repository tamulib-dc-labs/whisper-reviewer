00:02.950 --> 00:08.617
It's a hangman's tree, and it is I yourself.

00:08.637 --> 00:15.626
Oh, hangman, hangman, it's like your rope, or it's like it for a while.

00:16.427 --> 00:23.116
I think I see my own dear father come riding many miles.

00:23.977 --> 00:30.645
Oh, father, did you pay my gold, or did you bring my fee?

00:30.980 --> 00:37.709
Or did you come to see me hang to yonder's wheel of three?

00:38.831 --> 00:45.180
Oh, no, I did not bring your gold and did not pay your fee.

00:45.921 --> 00:53.852
I come to see you hang today to yonder's wheel of three.

00:53.872 --> 01:00.902
Oh, hangman, hangman, slack your rope, or slack it for a while.

01:01.439 --> 01:08.269
I think I see my own dear mother come riding me on your mind.

01:09.271 --> 01:15.861
Oh mother did you bring my gold or did you pay my fee?

01:16.803 --> 01:23.633
Or did you come to see me hang beyond a thrill of three?

01:24.457 --> 01:31.244
Oh, no, I did not bring your gold or did not pay your fee.

01:32.025 --> 01:38.992
I come to see you hang today beyond the blue sea.

01:40.234 --> 01:47.381
Oh, hangs my hands like your old folks, like it's far off mine.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.966
I think I see my own true love.

01:52.283 --> 01:55.506
Come riding in your mouth.

01:56.367 --> 02:00.110
Oh, true love, did you bring my gold?

02:00.291 --> 02:03.193
Or did you pay my fee?

02:03.974 --> 02:10.760
Or did you come to see me hang to yonder's wheel of three?

02:11.962 --> 02:18.848
Oh, yes, I brought you gold, my dear, and also paid your fee.

02:19.216 --> 02:26.391
I did not come to see you hang to yonder little tree.
