It's a hangman's tree, and it is I yourself.

00:08.637 --> 00:15.626
Oh, hangman, hangman, slack your rope, oh slack for a while.

00:16.427 --> 00:23.116
I think I see my own dear father come riding many miles.

00:23.977 --> 00:30.645
Oh, father, did you pay my gold, or did you bring my fee?

00:30.980 --> 00:37.709
Or did you come to see me hang on yonder willow tree?

00:38.831 --> 00:45.180
Oh, no, I did not bring your gold and did not pay your fee.

00:45.921 --> 00:53.852
I come to see you hang today on yonder willow tree.

00:53.872 --> 01:00.902
Oh, hangman, hangman, slack your rope, oh slack it for a while.

01:01.439 --> 01:08.269
I think I see my own dear mother come riding many a mile.

01:09.271 --> 01:15.861
Oh mother did you bring my gold or did you pay my fee?

01:16.803 --> 01:23.633
Or did you come to see me hang on yonder willow tree?

01:24.457 --> 01:31.244
Oh, no, I did not bring your gold or did not pay your fee.

01:32.025 --> 01:38.992
I come to see you hang today on yonder willow tree.

01:40.234 --> 01:47.381
Oh, hangman, hangman, slack your rope, oh slack it for a while.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.966
I think I see my own true love.

01:52.283 --> 01:55.506
Come riding many a mile.

01:56.367 --> 02:00.110
Oh, true love, did you bring my gold?

02:00.291 --> 02:03.193
Or did you pay my fee?

02:03.974 --> 02:10.760
Or did you come to see me hang to yonder willow tree?

02:11.962 --> 02:18.848
Oh, yes, I brought you gold, my dear, and also paid your fee.

02:19.216 --> 02:26.391
I did not come to see you hang on yonder willow tree.
