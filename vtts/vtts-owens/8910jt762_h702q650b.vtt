This is Donald Davidson.

00:04.002 --> 00:08.867
I'll sing a song that I learned from my father in Tennessee, Frog Went to Courten.

00:10.529 --> 00:13.332
Frog went to court and he did ride, and a-hum.

00:14.093 --> 00:19.498
Frog went to court and he did ride, sword and pistol by his side, and a-hum.

00:20.279 --> 00:23.122
He took little Mousy on his knee, and a-hum.

00:23.863 --> 00:29.329
He took little Mousy on his knee, and he said, little Mousy, will you marry me, and a-hum.

00:30.203 --> 00:54.945
Oh no, no, no, not without Uncle Rat's consent Oh no, no, no, not without Uncle Rat's consent I would not marry the President Old Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat side Old Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat side To think his niece would be a bride Oh where will the wedding supper be

00:55.364 --> 00:58.410
Oh, where will the wedding supper be?

00:58.570 --> 01:00.634
Away down yon in the hollabeach tree.

01:00.754 --> 01:04.361
Oh, what will the wedding supper be?

01:04.642 --> 01:08.349
Oh, what will the wedding supper be?

01:08.409 --> 01:11.415
Three green beans and a black-eyed pea.
