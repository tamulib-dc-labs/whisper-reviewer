In the right shape, but the wrong cue, that's all, by Tom Valentine.

00:08.437 --> 00:12.781
Now, who's that knocking at this hour to be shocking?

00:12.801 --> 00:16.044
Get no banging on a lady's door.

00:16.064 --> 00:23.491
Just listen, Jim Johnson, she's calling Miss Thompson, a fool and man pretend she don't live here no more.

00:23.511 --> 00:30.358
Miss Thompson done boom, but that can be proved, cause her trunk and little things ain't here.

00:30.878 --> 00:41.490
I don't explain, Mrs. Thompson don't remain, and I'm sorry for to tell you, dear, you're in the right church, but in the wrong queue.

00:41.510 --> 00:44.353
You're in the right neighborhood, that's true.

00:45.054 --> 00:48.578
You're in the right street, once more.

00:48.598 --> 00:52.202
You're in the right house, but on the wrong floor.

00:52.222 --> 00:58.449
But when you're out late, just get the name straight before you attempt to call.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.852
You're in the right church.

01:01.102 --> 01:20.882

01:20.862 --> 01:25.310
I got a rich sister, she's just living on the floor below.

01:25.972 --> 01:32.564
To whom it concerns, she's got money to burn, so you know just where to go.

01:32.584 --> 01:35.950
You're in the right church, but in the wrong pew.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.675
You're in the right neighborhood, that's true.

01:39.357 --> 01:41.200
You're in the right street.

01:41.686 --> 01:46.078
Once more, you're in the right house, but on the wrong floor.

01:46.138 --> 01:52.034
But when you're out late, just get the name straight before you attempt to call.

01:52.415 --> 01:58.210
You're in the right church, but the wrong tool, that's all.
