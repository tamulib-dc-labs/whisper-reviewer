Adelita, sung by Brownie McNeil.

00:09.573 --> 00:23.035
Oh, Adelita, se llama el joven AqueÃ±o dormir no puedo olvidar En el mundo yo tengo una rosa Que con el tiempo la voy a cortar

00:26.474 --> 00:42.258
If Adelita wanted to be my wife, if Adelita was my wife, I would buy a seda dress, I would take her to dance to the cartel.

00:42.358 --> 00:54.557
Adelita is called the young woman who I can't forget, in the world I have a rose that I'm going to cut with time.
