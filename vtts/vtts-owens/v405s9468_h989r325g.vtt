00:04.857 --> 00:22.782
Call me early in the morning Before it is too late Just when the day is dawning To swing on the golden gate

00:22.762 --> 00:41.210
I feel like I will expire if I don't get there by and by.

00:41.230 --> 00:45.276
Then I wake me, shake me, Joe, I think it's too late.

00:45.556 --> 00:50.203
I'm going away in the morning to swing on the golden gate.

00:54.638 --> 00:58.084
to swing on the golden gate.

00:58.857 --> 01:03.123
Won't you come and join the immigration?

01:03.143 --> 01:07.550
Oh, I don't want to leave you behind.

01:08.131 --> 01:16.082
We'll raise a great sensation when we reach that happy, happy climb.

01:16.743 --> 01:24.655
Well, just hand me down that death star, case I'm bound to look first ray.

01:25.196 --> 01:26.738
I must not lose.

01:26.718 --> 01:33.411
I lose my luster when I swing on the golden gate.

01:34.213 --> 01:37.760
Then wake me, shake me, don't let me sleep too late.

01:37.780 --> 01:41.347
I'm going away in the morning to swing on the golden gate.

01:41.387 --> 01:44.473
Then wake me, shake me, don't let me sleep too late.

01:44.493 --> 01:49.182
I'm going away in the morning to swing on the golden gate.
