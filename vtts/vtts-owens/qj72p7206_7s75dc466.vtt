The Two Orphans by L.F.

00:03.375 --> 00:06.560
Jeffers, lovely detective.

00:06.580 --> 00:16.356
I never can forget those two orphans that love seems to dwell in their way.

00:17.057 --> 00:27.253
Yes, these days when they were brought to the city, the lives of our dear ones to take.

00:27.233 --> 00:37.004
The doors were open at seven, and the curtains were rolled up at eight.

00:37.805 --> 00:41.709
And those that were seated were happy.

00:41.749 --> 00:46.434
Outside they were mad that were late.

00:47.415 --> 00:51.520
It's hard to you hear the dry fire.

00:52.040 --> 00:57.206
How dismal those bells they do sound.

00:57.847 --> 01:06.637
Tis Brooklyn's theater that's burning, the last burning down to the ground.

01:07.518 --> 01:17.170
The mothers were weeping and crying for the sons who had been out all night.

01:17.639 --> 01:21.864
They prayed that their souls would meet in heaven.

01:22.805 --> 01:25.989
Among the innocent and bright.

01:26.910 --> 01:30.815
Next morning among those black ruins.

01:31.936 --> 01:36.421
Oh God, what a sight met our eyes.

01:37.122 --> 01:41.267
They did, they were lying in all shape.

01:41.848 --> 01:45.672
Some of them you could not recognize.

01:46.208 --> 01:56.009
I never can forget those two orphans that left seem to dwell in their wings.

01:56.811 --> 02:05.449
It seems they were brought to our city, the lives of our dear ones to take.
