00:01.499 --> 00:03.621
Well, this is Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:03.641 --> 00:05.123
I know you know that story.

00:05.143 --> 00:09.929
There was three children from the land of Israel, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

00:10.029 --> 00:14.554
They took a trip into the land of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

00:14.614 --> 00:19.119
Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

00:19.139 --> 00:24.045
He took a lot of gold and he made an idol, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

00:24.825 --> 00:28.890
And he told everybody when you hear the music of the cornet and the flute,

00:29.208 --> 00:31.072
And a harp.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.017
Well, you must fall down and worship the idol.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.642
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

00:37.083 --> 00:39.688
But the children of Israel would not bow down.

00:39.728 --> 00:41.952
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

00:42.052 --> 00:43.956
Couldn't fool him with a golden idol.

00:44.236 --> 00:47.382
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

00:47.402 --> 00:49.647
I said you couldn't fool him with a golden idol.

00:49.947 --> 00:52.532
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

01:01.321 --> 01:04.004
So the king put the children in the fiery furnace.

01:04.084 --> 01:06.326
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

01:06.346 --> 01:08.508
Heaped on the coals and the red-hot brimstone.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.790
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

01:10.810 --> 01:12.952
Seven times hotter, hotter than it ought to be.

01:13.052 --> 01:15.194
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

01:15.234 --> 01:17.556
Burnt up the soldiers the king had put there.

01:17.576 --> 01:19.978
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

01:20.439 --> 01:25.343
But the Lord said an angel with snowy white wings down in the middle of the furnace.

01:25.363 --> 01:27.906
Talking to the children about the power of the gods.

01:27.926 --> 01:30.248
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

01:30.228 --> 01:37.561
Well, he couldn't even burn the hair on the head of Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, laughing and talking while the fire boys were jumping.

01:38.783 --> 01:40.105
Meshach, Abednego.

01:40.506 --> 01:44.553
And the old neighbor could never call hey there when he saw the power of the Lord.

01:44.974 --> 01:47.298
And he had a big time in the house of battle.

01:47.318 --> 01:49.682
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.

01:49.702 --> 01:51.245
Oh, oh, oh, Abednego.

01:51.806 --> 01:53.569
There you is, Professor, there you is.
