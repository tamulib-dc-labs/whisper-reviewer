This is Ghost playing the blues about my black gal.

00:11.246 --> 00:12.087
Go ahead and play it, Ghost.

00:12.107 --> 00:17.075
You know you can play it.

00:17.095 --> 00:34.543
Woke up this morning looking at the blinding sun, Thinking about my jet black woman Wondering what had I done. 
Got the blues about my black gal. Yeah, she got the blues about me.

00:38.253 --> 00:45.662
Yes, and I'm blue and I'm lonesome, darling, as any poor boy can be.

00:52.271 --> 00:55.275
The brook runs in the river.

00:55.295 --> 00:56.877
The river runs in the sea.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.942
My black woman does quit me.

01:00.962 --> 01:02.384
She won't write to me.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.087
Got the blues about my black gal. Yeah, she got the blues about me.

01:14.180 --> 01:26.517
And I believe I'll go back, back to dear old Tennessee.

01:26.537 --> 01:33.186
I asked my jet black woman, what makes you treat me so?

01:33.206 --> 01:37.973
She said, look here, daddy, I don't want you no more.

01:37.993 --> 01:40.997
Got the blues about my black gal. Yeah, she got the blues about me.

01:53.701 --> 02:06.040
Yes, and I'm blue and I'm lonesome, darling, as any poor boy can be.

02:06.040 --> 02:34.000
