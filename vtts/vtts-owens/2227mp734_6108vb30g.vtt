00:09.177 --> 00:11.998
I am on the battlefield for my Lord.

00:11.998 --> 00:37.882
I am on the battlefield for my Lord. I promised him that I would serve him till I die. I am on the battlefield for my Lord. 

00:37.882 --> 00:45.997
I was a alone and idle. I was a sinner too.

00:46.017 --> 00:55.774
I heard a voice from heaven saying what I could do, saying what I could do.

00:55.794 --> 00:58.860
I took my massive hand, 

00:58.860 --> 01:08.000
and I joined the Christian band. I am on the battlefield for my Lord.

01:08.000 --> 01:38.000
I am on the battlefield for my Lord. I am on the battlefield for my Lord. I promised him that I would serve him till I die. I am on the battlefield for my Lord. 

01:42.277 --> 01:47.707
I left my friends and kindred bound for the promised land.

01:47.727 --> 01:51.974
The grace of God upon me.

01:51.994 --> 01:55.480
The Bible in my hand.

01:55.501 --> 01:57.484
In distant lands I trod

01:57.484 --> 
Crying, sinner, won't you come to God? I am on the battlefield for my Lord.

02:10.103 --> 02:36.975
I am on the battlefield for my Lord. I am on the battlefield for my Lord. I promised him that I would serve him till I die. I am on the battlefield for my Lord.
