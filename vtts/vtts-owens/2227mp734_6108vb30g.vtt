00:09.177 --> 00:11.998
I am on battle.

00:37.882 --> 00:45.997
I was a lonely idol, I was a sinner too.

00:46.017 --> 00:55.774
I heard a voice from heaven saying what I could do, saying what I could do.

00:55.794 --> 00:58.860
I took my massive hand.

01:42.277 --> 01:47.707
I'm a father from this land.

01:47.727 --> 01:51.974
The grace of God can be.

01:51.994 --> 01:55.480
The Bible in my hand.

01:55.501 --> 01:57.484
In this one land I trust.

02:10.103 --> 02:12.975
For my lord.
