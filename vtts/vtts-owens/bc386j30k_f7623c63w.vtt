00:02.765 --> 00:06.178
Flectation means I am conscious.

00:06.198 --> 00:06.885
Still protected.

00:18.053 --> 00:26.022
Eight years in the prime of this man who's a girl with golden hair.

00:27.123 --> 00:29.807
I never thought that she loved me.

00:30.287 --> 00:33.971
Never thought that she even cared.

00:34.412 --> 00:41.941
And I was cold but sadly under a crown of golden hair.

00:42.982 --> 00:46.626
I never thought that she loved me.

00:46.910 --> 00:50.534
Never saw such an even trail.

00:50.574 --> 00:55.460
Down a hill drew sadly under.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.983
A crown of golden hair.

00:58.964 --> 01:03.490
As she leans from a carriage window.

01:03.510 --> 01:06.353
A beautiful haunting face.

01:06.373 --> 01:09.036
A cold and hell.

01:11.260 --> 01:14.547
All dressed in silk and lay.

01:15.128 --> 01:21.621
Why he goes where the people all wasted or ran cold.

01:22.363 --> 01:26.973
A heart to soon grow weary.

01:26.993 --> 01:29.718
A man to soon grow old.

01:30.961 --> 01:32.003
I never thought.

01:31.983 --> 01:33.587
That you love me.

01:33.607 --> 01:37.777
I thought she gave him a hand.

01:38.418 --> 01:42.387
And gals bring your robes all around town.

01:42.407 --> 01:45.655
She left him alone on the sand.
