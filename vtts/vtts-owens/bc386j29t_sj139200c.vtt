These bones gonna rise again.

00:06.556 --> 00:08.661
Lord, he made a garden fair.

00:08.681 --> 00:10.766
These bones gonna rise again.

00:10.786 --> 00:12.671
Made Adam then he put him there.

Oh, I know it, know it. Indeed, I know it. Know it, these bones gonna rise again.

At that tree she took a pull, these bones gonna rise again. Then she filled her apron full, these bones gonna rise again.

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
The next day when the Lord come down, these bones gonna rise again. At that pair how he did frown, these bones gonna rise again.

You can't find no rest, nowhere, these bones gonna rise again.

01:30.787 --> 01:35.391
Burn your dead body, shred your brow, these bones gonna rise again.

01:35.411 --> 01:42.398
And I guess that's what they've been doing now, these bones gonna rise again.

01:42.563 --> 01:52.945
