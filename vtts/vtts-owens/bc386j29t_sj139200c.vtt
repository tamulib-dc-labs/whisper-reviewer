00:03.389 --> 00:05.654
These bones wanna rise again.

00:06.556 --> 00:08.661
Lord, he made a garden fair.

00:08.681 --> 00:10.766
These bones wanna rise again.

00:10.786 --> 00:12.671
Made more fatter than he put him there.

00:12.691 --> 00:14.736
These bones wanna rise again.

00:15.036 --> 00:17.101
Took a rib from Adam's side.

00:17.162 --> 00:19.086
These bones wanna rise again.

00:21.918 --> 00:43.335
But that tree you mustn't catch, these bones gonna rise again.

00:46.927 --> 01:16.933
These bones wanna rise again In the garden safe and slump These bones wanna rise again At Miss Eve is how he wants These bones wanna rise again At that tree he took a fool These bones wanna rise again Then she'd kill her, ate some food These bones wanna rise again The next day when it'll all come down These bones wanna rise again At that hair how he did frown These bones wanna rise again Cause I know this snowy

01:16.913 --> 01:23.359
Indeed indeed, I know that sisters, I know that we, these bones won't rise.

01:23.379 --> 01:25.942
In fair, these bones won't rise again.

01:26.202 --> 01:30.386
You can't find no rest, nowhere, these bones won't rise again.

01:30.787 --> 01:35.391
Burn your dead body, shred your brow, these bones won't rise again.

01:35.411 --> 01:42.398
And I guess that's what they for doing now, these bones won't rise again.

01:42.563 --> 01:52.945
I know that we be gone, gone to rise again.
