After a while, it all will be over.

00:06.301 --> 00:13.193
Oh, after a while, the sun is going to shine.

00:15.277 --> 00:19.945
Oh, after a while, the dark clouds will all pass over.

00:19.985 --> 00:27.658
We will shout hallelujah after a while.

00:28.904 --> 00:41.088
There's a leaf, the eye is always watching. Oh, trying to see everything that you do. 

00:41.088 --> 00:57.541
Oh, there's a leaf, the tongue is always busy. It will lie on me and lie on you. Oh, but after a while

It all will be over.

01:02.106 --> 01:06.451

01:08.473 --> 01:12.878
Oh, after a while, dark clouds, they all pass over.

01:14.780 --> 01:19.545
Lord knows we can shout, hallelujah, after a while.

01:21.568 --> 01:26.333
Your cup sometimes gets mighty bit old.

01:27.899 --> 01:32.685
So bitter, sometimes it makes you cry.

01:32.705 --> 01:38.992
Lord, through your tears, kneel down and call King Jesus.

01:40.754 --> 01:45.980
He will fix it, all right, after a while.

01:47.121 --> 01:52.067
After a while, it all will be over.

01:53.127 --> 01:58.296
Oh, after a while, the sun is going to shine.

01:58.316 --> 02:04.587
Oh, after a while, dark clouds will all pass over.

02:06.190 --> 02:12.300
Lord knows we can shout, hallelujah, after a while.
