The Little Dope Shack by Daniel Jeffers of Lovelace.

00:05.512 --> 00:11.121
I love to sit along at night while the moon is shining bright.

00:11.482 --> 00:15.288
The stars up in heaven wink at me.

00:16.310 --> 00:21.698
I love to sing a song that my mother, my mother used to sing.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.646
As she cradle me upon her loving knees.

00:27.554 --> 00:32.739
I can hear the whippoorwill, they're calling for me still.

00:33.099 --> 00:36.883
They sing the song to me of peace and rest.

00:38.284 --> 00:46.993
They seem to say to me, come back to your used to be, to your little dopey shack away out west.

00:48.394 --> 00:53.259
I could hear the cattle lowing as they stroll along a trail.

00:54.159 --> 00:56.802
I could see the moon a-shining on

00:59.397 --> 01:08.805
It sends a light from heaven to that dopey door of mine, and a silver tint to every blood and stain.

01:10.006 --> 01:14.890
I could hear the whippoorwill, they're calling for me still.

01:15.250 --> 01:18.974
They sing a song for me of peace and rest.

01:20.255 --> 01:28.982
They seem to say to me, come back to your used to be, to your little nobie shack away out west.

01:29.924 --> 01:35.032
I'll be coming back someday, but the debt I can't repay.

01:37.216 --> 01:39.359
You'll know me, that's where I was born.

01:40.982 --> 01:50.717
The doors were tumbling and the roof led in the rain, but it sheltered me from every wind and storm.

01:51.170 --> 01:56.257
I can hear the whippoorwill, they're calling for me still.

01:56.618 --> 02:00.243
They sing a song to me of peace and rest.

02:01.645 --> 02:11.980
They seem to say to me, come back to your each of these, to your little dopey shack away out with.
