He must have seen me on Denny.

00:20.669 --> 00:25.195
I am he.

00:25.816 --> 00:29.861
I am one through thee.

00:31.984 --> 00:33.486
Dawn through thee.

00:35.348 --> 00:36.690
Dawn through thee.

00:39.333 --> 00:42.577
Dawn through thee.

00:42.677 --> 00:43.719
Dawn through thee.

00:45.061 --> 00:45.661
Dawn through thee.

00:46.322 --> 00:46.723
Dawn through thee.

00:46.743 --> 00:48.144

Dawn through thee.

00:48.926 --> 00:49.326
Dawn through thee.

00:49.610 --> 00:53.258
Lead me on.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.748
It is lost in my hand.

00:57.768 --> 01:01.577
And lead me on and let me dance.

01:01.962 --> 01:09.053
I am so tight, I am so weak, I am far.

01:09.173 --> 01:20.410
Oh, lead to the storm, and lead to the night, and lead, oh child, lead to the light, and lead to my hand.

01:20.693 --> 01:25.821
Let the Lord lead me on.

01:26.081 --> 01:34.213
Let the Lord lead me on and lead me on and lead me back.

01:34.233 --> 01:37.538
I am so tired, I am weak.

01:37.518 --> 01:40.503
I am warm.

01:41.545 --> 01:43.829
Oh, you need to look strong.

01:43.849 --> 01:45.633
And you need to die.

01:45.813 --> 01:48.979
And you need your child, oh, you need to die.

01:48.999 --> 01:50.221
And you need your child, oh, you need to die.

01:50.241 --> 01:51.443
And take my hand.

01:51.659 --> 02:07.542
When my life is on.

02:07.522 --> 02:22.543
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:22.523 --> 02:29.017
I am so tired.

02:29.278 --> 02:38.338
I am so beautiful.

02:38.318 --> 02:42.927
I am far.

02:42.947 --> 02:49.019
Oh, me to the storm, and me to the night, and me to the shadow.

02:49.039 --> 02:53.307
Me to the light, I want to make my hand.

02:53.327 --> 02:58.217
Me to the storm, me to the home.
