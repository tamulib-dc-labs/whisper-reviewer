Emerald, Texas, March 4th, 1939.

00:07.868 --> 00:19.107
Oh, Molly, oh, Molly, it's for your sake alone that I leave my old parents, my house and my home.

00:21.070 --> 00:25.758
That I leave my old parents, you cause me to roam.

00:25.778 --> 00:29.464
I'm a rebel soldier and Dixie's my home.

00:31.283 --> 00:58.557
My boots in my stirrups, my bridles in my hand I'm going to leave Molly, the fairest in the land Her parents don't like me, they say I'm too poor They say I'm unworthy to enter her door They say I drink whiskey, my money's my own And them that don't like me can leave me alone

00:59.347 --> 01:01.310
I'll eat when I'm hungry.

01:01.490 --> 01:03.353
I'll drink when I'm dry.

01:03.474 --> 01:09.203
And when I get thirsty, I'll lay down and cry.

01:09.223 --> 01:17.916
I'll build me a castle on yonder mountain high where my true love can see me when she comes riding by.

01:17.936 --> 01:22.223
Where my true love can see me and help me to mourn.

01:22.584 --> 01:24.627
I'm a rebel soldier.

01:24.647 --> 01:26.029
She's my home.

01:27.882 --> 01:31.869
I'll get up in my saddle, my quirt in my hand.

01:31.989 --> 01:35.976
I'll think of you, Molly, when in some distant land.

01:36.917 --> 01:40.904
I'll think of you, Molly, you've caused me to roam.

01:41.365 --> 01:46.313
I'm a rebel soldier, and he sees my own.

01:46.580 --> 01:54.733
Beet steak when I'm hungry, rye whiskey when I'm dry, green back when I'm hard, up in heaven when I die.

01:55.575 --> 01:59.581
Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, rye whiskey, I cry.

01:59.661 --> 02:03.728
If you don't give me rye whiskey, I truly will die.

02:05.345 --> 02:12.915
If the ocean was whiskey and I was a duck, I'd dive through the bottom and never come up.

02:13.295 --> 02:21.045
But the ocean ain't whiskey and I ain't a duck, so I'll play Jack the Diamond and trust you my love.

02:21.606 --> 02:27.994
Oh, whiskey, oh, brandy, I like you pretty well, you've killed all my kinfolk.

02:33.155 --> 02:38.845
I guess you'll send me when I'm ready to die.
