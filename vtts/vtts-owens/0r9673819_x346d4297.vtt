00:02.039 --> 00:08.668
This is Colonel De Noon, Springfield, Missouri, and the song that I'm a-singin' entitled to Risslety rosselty.

00:09.849 --> 00:17.259
I made me wife in the month of June, Risslety rosselty, na-na-na, took her home by the light of the moon.

00:17.279 --> 00:23.828
Risslety rosselty, hey-don risselty, nikelty, nakelty, risselty, rosselty, willety, wallety, na-na-na.

00:24.365 --> 00:27.109
Oh, she swept her floor but once a year.

00:27.289 --> 00:29.272
Risslety, rosselty, na-na-na.

00:29.312 --> 00:31.476
She for her brooms is all too dear.

00:31.836 --> 00:38.126
Risslety, rosselty, hey-don rosselty, nikelty, nakelty, risselty, rosselty, willety, wallety, na-na-na.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.030
Oh, she combed her hair but once a year.

00:41.390 --> 00:47.179
Risslety, rosselty na-na-na.

00:47.199 --> 00:48.160
Oh, she combed her hair but once a year.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.883
Risslety, rosselty, nikelty, nakelty, risselty, rosselty, willety, wallety, na-na-na.

00:49.863 --> 00:57.013
Oh, she churned her butter in that gold booth. Risslety, rosselty na-na-na.

00:57.494 --> 01:07.669
And for a dye, she used her foot. Risslety, rosselty, hey-don rosselty, nikelty, nakelty, risselty, rosselty, willety, wallety, na-na-na.

01:07.649 --> 01:10.793
Oh, the butter turned to a grizzly gray.

01:10.913 --> 01:13.016
Risslety, rosselty na-na-na.

01:13.056 --> 01:15.380
The cheese took legs and ran away.

01:15.760 --> 01:22.690
Risslety, rosselty, hey-don rosselty, nikelty, nakelty, risselty, rosselty, willety, wallety, na-na-na.

01:23.210 --> 01:25.894
Oh, the saddle and battle is on no dip. Risslety, rosselty na-na-na.

01:25.874 --> 01:38.078
You want it no more, you must sing it yourself. Risslety, rosselty, hey-don rosselty, nikelty, nakelty, risselty, rosselty, willety, wallety, na-na-na.
