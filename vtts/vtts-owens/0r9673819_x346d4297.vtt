This is Colonel De Noon, Springfield, Missouri, and the song that I'm a-singin' entitled to Ristledy Rosseldy.

00:09.849 --> 00:17.259
I made me wife in the month of June, Ristledy Rosseldy, na-na-na, took her home by the light of the moon.

00:17.279 --> 00:23.828
Ristledy Rosseldy, hey, don't ristledy, mickledy, mickledy, ristledy, co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co.

00:24.365 --> 00:27.109
Oh, she swept her floor but once a year.

00:27.289 --> 00:29.272
Rissledy, rossledy, no, no, no.

00:29.312 --> 00:31.476
She for her brooms is all too dear.

00:31.836 --> 00:38.126
Rissledy, rossledy, hey, don't rossledy, nickledy, nackledy, rustical quality will it do while it is now, now, now.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.030
Oh, she combed her hair but once a year.

00:41.390 --> 00:47.179
Rissledy, rossledy, nackledy, nackledy, rustical quality will it do while it is now, now, now.

00:47.199 --> 00:48.160
Oh, she combed her hair but once a year.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.883
Rissledy, rossledy, nackledy, nackledy, rustical quality

00:49.863 --> 00:57.013
Oh, she churned her butter in that gold booth.

00:57.494 --> 01:07.669
And for a die, she used her foot.

01:07.649 --> 01:10.793
Oh, the butter turned to a grizzly gray.

01:10.913 --> 01:13.016
Riffle-dee, rottle-dee, na-na-na.

01:13.056 --> 01:15.380
The cheese took legs and ran away.

01:15.760 --> 01:22.690
Riffle-dee, rottle-dee, haze on rottle-dee, nickel-dee, nickel-dee, rectical quality, willy-dee, wall-dee, na-na-na.

01:23.210 --> 01:25.894
Oh, the saddle and battle is on no dip.

01:25.874 --> 01:38.078
You want it no more, you must sing it yourself.
