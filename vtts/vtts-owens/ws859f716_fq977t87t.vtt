When my nights are lonesome, come to see me once in a while.

When my nights are lonesome, mama, come to see me once in a while.

00:38.386 --> 00:44.533
I like to look in your face, baby, and I like to see you smile.

00:49.272 --> 01:01.064
You're the sweetest sugar mama, sweetest little thing I ever seen.

01:01.084 --> 01:08.051
You're the sweetest sugar mama, sweetest little thing I ever seen.

01:08.171 --> 01:15.278
Oh, well, I love you, baby.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.942
I swear I can't treat you mean.

01:23.630 --> 01:25.974
Let me hold you in my heart.

01:28.378 --> 01:34.889
I'll sit you in my rocking chair.

01:35.791 --> 01:38.996
Let me hold you in my heart.

01:39.537 --> 01:41.841
I'll sit you in my rocking chair.

02:02.780 --> 02:10.149
I can't try to look in your face.

02:10.409 --> 02:13.553
My life's all so awesome, baby.

02:14.014 --> 02:21.523
I can't try to look in your face.

02:21.763 --> 02:25.868
I want to look in your face.

02:45.018 --> 02:50.488
Mommy's all coming home.
