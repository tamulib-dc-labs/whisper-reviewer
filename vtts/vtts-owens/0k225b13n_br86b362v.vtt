Two little children, a boy and a girl, sat by an old church door.

00:17.235 --> 00:27.068
The little girl's feet were as brown as the curls that fell on the dress that she wore.

00:27.335 --> 00:36.864
The boy's coat was faded and hatless his head, a tear showing in his little eyes.

00:36.884 --> 00:42.330
Why don't you run home to your mama, she said.

00:42.810 --> 00:46.494
And this was the maiden's reply.

00:46.894 --> 00:51.579
We can't earn our bread, dear, too little, she said.

00:51.799 --> 00:55.823
Jim's five years, I'm only seven.

00:56.107 --> 01:24.240
We've come here to stay For the close of the day For we have no mama in our home. Mama's in heaven, they took her away, left Jim and I all go home. Why don't you run home To your mama, she said. And this was the maiden's reply,

01:24.507 --> 01:50.768
Mama's in heaven, they took her away Left here and I alone. We've come here to stay For the close of the day For we have no mama in our home. Papa's lost out on the sea long ago. We waited all night on the shore.

01:51.085 --> 02:00.255
For he was life-saving captain, you know, and he never came back anymore.

02:00.595 --> 02:05.260
We can't earn our bread, we're too little, she said.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.985
Jim's five years, I'm only seven.

02:09.465 --> 02:18.595
They come here to stay for the close of the day, for we have no mama in our home.

02:18.878 --> 02:27.646
The Texans came early to ring the church bell and found them beneath us no cry.

02:27.947 --> 02:37.656
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell in heaven with mama at night.

02:37.676 --> 02:42.320
We can't earn our bread, we're too little, she says.

02:42.340 --> 02:46.084
Jim's five years, I'm only seven.

02:46.435 --> 02:51.855
We've come here to stay for the schools of the day.
