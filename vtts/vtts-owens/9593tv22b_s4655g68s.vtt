00:01.313 --> 00:13.291
The day is growing darker now, and I'm growing very deep.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.156
Let one drop of water matter.

00:16.797 --> 00:24.228
Fall up, fall up, and evermore shall play.

00:24.248 --> 00:28.755
Give them all my cards that matter, that matter, that will be the same.

00:29.393 --> 00:37.444
You will be this motherland.

00:37.464 --> 00:43.773
You, you, put the shoes away.

00:43.793 --> 00:48.319
Give them all my cards that I lay.

00:48.339 --> 00:51.203
Put my little shoes away.

00:51.224 --> 00:51.844
Santa Claus brought them to me.

00:51.864 --> 00:55.890
There's so many traditions, and I never remember.

00:56.157 --> 01:06.477
With a caragony, baby, staying with a larger.

01:06.597 --> 01:13.310
And ask, don't you listen to me, mother?

01:13.330 --> 01:18.300
As he walks around the street, you, you, don't you, tell it away.

01:18.770 --> 01:26.569
Give them all my cards that matter, but my little place.
