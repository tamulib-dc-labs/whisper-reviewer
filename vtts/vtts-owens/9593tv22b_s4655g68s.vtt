Put My Little Shoes Away. The day is growing darker mother, and I'm growing very weak.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.156
Let one drop of water mother.

00:16.797 --> 00:24.228
Fall up... and nevermore shall play.

00:24.248 --> 00:28.755
Give them...mother...

00:29.393 --> 00:37.444
You will...mother. You, you, put the shoes away. You will...mother

00:37.464 --> 00:43.773
You, you, put the shoes away.

00:51.224 --> 00:51.844
Santa Claus brought them to me.

00:51.864 --> 00:55.890
With a lot of other things, and I never remember.

00:56.157 --> 01:06.477
With a caragony, baby, staying with a larger.

01:06.597 --> 01:13.310
And ask, don't you listen to me, mother?

01:13.330 --> 01:18.300
As he walks around the street, you, you, don't you, tell it away.

01:18.770 --> 01:26.569
Give them all my cards that matter, but my little place.
