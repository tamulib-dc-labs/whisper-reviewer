00:11.438 --> 00:22.129
In a distant land from west, I have a mother kind of fast.

00:22.149 --> 00:29.016
There I pray the mold and silver of gold.

00:29.036 --> 00:35.142
And the song she used to sing, happy praise and share with dreams.

00:35.723 --> 00:41.108
And my loving father's voice has never grown.

00:41.695 --> 00:48.010
She was faithful, she was true, she was kind and loving too.

00:48.462 --> 01:13.727
And I always wept wherever I was alone But he prayed to God his day In his own appointed way That he'll someday bring me spaces to a home Since I left my mother's home Since I choose a part to roam

01:13.707 --> 01:20.934
I miss her tender care from day to day.

01:20.954 --> 01:27.800
I miss her loving voice, always made my heart rejoice.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.643
She would carry me as a journey on my way.

01:31.663 --> 01:37.989
He was faithful, he was true, he was kind and loving too.

01:38.009 --> 01:43.714
And he always went wherever I would know.

01:43.964 --> 02:02.314
This record was made by Mary Riley down at Franklin, Texas.

02:02.334 --> 02:04.657
Mary is a character if I've ever known one.

02:05.198 --> 02:11.288
She is about 65, very large and very black.

02:11.605 --> 02:14.055
and exceedingly jolly.
