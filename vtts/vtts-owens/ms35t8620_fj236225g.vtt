00:11.438 --> 00:22.129
In a distant land out west, I have a mother kind and fair.

00:22.149 --> 00:29.016
That I treasure more than silver or gold.

00:29.036 --> 00:35.142
And the song she used to sing, happy praise and cheer would bring.

00:35.723 --> 00:41.108
And my loving mother's voice has never grown old.

00:41.695 --> 00:48.010
She was faithful, she was true, she was kind and loving too.

00:48.462 --> 01:00.727
And I always wept wherever I would roam. But she prayed to God each day In his own appointed way

01:00.727 --> 01:13.000
That he'd someday bring me safely to her home. Since I left my mother's home, Since I choose a part to roam

01:13.707 --> 01:20.934
I miss her tender care from day to day.

01:20.954 --> 01:27.800
I miss her loving voice, always made my heart rejoice.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.643
She would carry me as I journied on my way.

01:31.663 --> 01:37.989
She was faithful, he was true, he was kind and loving too.

01:38.009 --> 01:43.714
And she always went wherever I would roam.

01:43.714 --> 01:55.000
But she prayed to God each day In his own appointed way That he'd someday bring me safely to her home.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.314
This record was made by Mary Riley down at Franklin, Texas.

02:02.334 --> 02:04.657
Mary is a character if I've ever known one.

02:05.198 --> 02:11.288
She is about 65, very large and very black.

02:11.605 --> 02:14.055
and exceedingly jolly.
