Lady Mary, an old English ballad.

00:05.449 --> 00:30.156
He came from his palace grand And he came to my cottage door His words were few but his looks They will linger forevermore The smile in his sad dark eyes

00:30.592 --> 00:59.940
More tender than words could be But I was nothing to him Though he was the word to me And there in the garden strolled All robes in fine satin and lace Lady Mary so strange and cold

01:00.578 --> 01:14.976
Who held in his heart no place For he knew I would be his bride With a kiss for a lifetime feast

01:15.412 --> 01:25.085
But I was nothing to him, though he was the world to me.

01:25.285 --> 01:44.490
Today in his palace grand, on a flower-strewn bed he lies, with his beautiful lips fast-closed, or his beautiful, sad, dark eyes.

01:44.723 --> 01:53.957
Among the mourners who mourn Why should I a mourner be?

01:54.979 --> 02:08.740
For I was nothing to him Though he was the world to me For I was nothing to him

02:10.323 --> 02:16.182
Though he was the world to me.
