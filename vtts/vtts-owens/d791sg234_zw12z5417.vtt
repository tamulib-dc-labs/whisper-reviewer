00:02.748 --> 00:05.991
The shallow choir singing Every Time I Feel the Spirit.

00:05.991 --> 00:16.000
[Music.]

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

00:25.000 --> 00:35.653
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
Out on the mountains, when my God spoke, out of his mouth came fire and smoke.

00:43.000 --> 00:52.000
Looked all around me, it looked so fine, till I asked my Lord if all were mine.

00:52.000 --> 01:02.831
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

01:02.831 --> 01:10.487
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

01:12.644 --> 01:20.242
And I have trials, and I have woes, and I have heartache, here we go.

01:20.583 --> 01:29.083
But while God leads me, I'll never fear, for I am sheltered, I am there.

01:29.300 --> 01:37.785
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

01:37.785 --> 01:46.765
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

01:46.765 --> 01:56.453
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

01:56.653 --> 02:15.467
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart

02:15.976 --> 02:19.219
I will pray.
