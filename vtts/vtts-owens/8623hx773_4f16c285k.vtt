Jefferson Lovelady.

00:06.705 --> 00:28.789

00:29.562 --> 00:56.093
Oh Sally, pretty Sally, oh Sally, says he, I'm sorry, oh my love, and yours don't agree, A ruin, a ruin, I ever shall be, Unless there is a liking that you take to me, I never can have you, nor no other man,

01:01.300 --> 01:05.747
Her being so rich and her portion so high.

01:06.529 --> 01:11.958
Upon this young night she did scarce cast an eye.

I never can forgive you, enduring my breath.

02:17.287 --> 02:21.193
I'll dance all over your grave when you're laid under the earth.

02:21.713 --> 02:25.959
