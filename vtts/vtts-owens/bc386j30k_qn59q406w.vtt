00:08.358 --> 00:16.042
...one evening in May. For a sweet recreation I scarcely can say. 

00:16.042 --> 00:25.000
As I sat amusing myself in the cage Oh who should come near me but a young Indian maid.

00:25.000 --> 00:35.000
She sat down beside me and taking my hand. I see you are a stranger, not one of our land.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
But if you will follow, you're welcome to come

00:39.000 --> 00:45.184
And share in my cottage, the bliss of my home.

00:45.806 --> 00:50.517
Together we wander, and together we roam.

00:50.537 --> 00:54.827
Till we came to a log hush in a coconut grove.

00:55.077 --> 01:03.373
With kindly impression she's there done to me. If you will consent, sir, and live here with me. 

01:03.373 --> 01:13.000
And go no more ramblings all o'er the South Sea, I'll teach you the language of Little Mohea.

01:13.353 --> 01:17.360
Oh, no, pretty maiden, this never could be.

01:18.001 --> 01:21.848
I have a true lover all o'er the South Sea.

01:22.510 --> 01:31.105
I could not forsake her and live here with thee, for her heart beats as truly as Little Mohea.

01:31.666 --> 01:36.475
This fair young lady, she's handsome in time.

01:36.455 --> 01:45.408
She acted her part as a heaven design For I was a stranger and she took me to her home. 

01:45.408 --> 01:59.000
And I think of Little Mohea as a wanderer alone. The last time I saw her she stood on the sand. As they are still passed by her she waved me her hand.

01:59.388 --> 02:03.894
Think when you get back to the girl that you love.

02:04.395 --> 02:08.199
Just think of Little Mohea in a coconut grove.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.966
Now I am safe landing my home shore.

02:13.486 --> 02:18.072
For my friends and companions can see me once more.

02:18.092 --> 02:22.258
Little girls all crowd round me, but none do I see.

02:22.598 --> 02:26.323
That I can compare with my Little Mohea.
