00:10.358 --> 00:33.042
For a sweet recreation I scarcely can say As I sat amusing myself in the cage Oh who should come near me but a young Indian man He sat down beside me and taking my hand They see you are a stranger

00:41.375 --> 00:45.184
in my cottage, just no bliss of home.

00:45.806 --> 00:50.517
Together we wander, together we roam.

00:50.537 --> 00:54.827
Till we came to a log hush in a full full muddle.

00:55.077 --> 01:13.373
With kindly impression she's there done to me If you will consent, sir, and live here with me And go no more ramblings all o'er the South Sea I'll teach you the language of Little Maltese

01:13.353 --> 01:17.360
Oh, no, pretty maiden, this never could be.

01:18.001 --> 01:21.848
I have a true lover all o'er the South Sea.

01:22.510 --> 01:31.105
I could not forsake her and live here with thee, for her heart beats as truly as a little monkey.

01:31.666 --> 01:36.475
This fair young lady, she's handsome in time.

01:36.455 --> 01:59.408
She acted her part as a heaven design For I was a stranger and she took me to her home And I think of little Maldi as a wanderer alone The last time I saw her she stood on the sand As they are still passed by her she waved me her hand

01:59.388 --> 02:03.894
Think when you get back to the girl that you love.

02:04.395 --> 02:08.199
Just think of little Maltie in a full full nutshell.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.966
Now I am safe landing on Hudson's future.

02:13.486 --> 02:18.072
For my friends and companions can do me once more.

02:18.092 --> 02:22.258
Little girls all crowd round me, but none do I see.

02:22.598 --> 02:26.323
That I can compare with my little Maltie.
