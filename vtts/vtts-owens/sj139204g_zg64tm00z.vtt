The Irish Girl by Daniel Jefferson.

00:06.525 --> 00:18.415
As I walked out one morning down by the riverside, my eyes were cast around me and an Irish girl I'd buy.

00:19.576 --> 00:31.827
So red and rosy was her cheek, and so curly was her hair, and so costly was the jewelry that Irish girl did wear.

00:32.127 --> 01:00.750
The tears came trickling down her cheek And she began to cry She said, my true love's gone to Ireland And highly forsaken am I I wish I was in Ireland Sitting in a chair Within my hands a glass of wine And my true love by my side I wish I was in Ireland

01:01.355 --> 01:09.127
Sitting in a chair, within my hands a glass of wine and Missoula by my side.

01:10.369 --> 01:15.317
I'd call for candy kisses and pay them as I go.

01:15.958 --> 01:20.986
I'd sail aloft the ocean, let the winds blow high or low.

01:21.827 --> 01:24.331
Love, oh love, it's a killing thing.

01:24.932 --> 01:27.396
Did you ever feel the pain?

01:27.595 --> 01:34.129
How hard it is to love anyone and never be loved again.
