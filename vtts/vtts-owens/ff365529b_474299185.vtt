00:01.178 --> 00:09.448
Excuse me, Lord, in the service.

00:10.670 --> 00:16.977
Draw me narrow every day.

00:19.140 --> 00:28.131
I am willing, Lord, to run all the way.

00:28.330 --> 00:38.405
If I falter, while I'm trying, don't be angry.

00:39.867 --> 00:41.750
Let me stay.

00:43.673 --> 00:53.087
I am willing, Lord, to run all the way.

00:54.329 --> 00:56.953
Pain by heartaches.

00:58.098 --> 01:07.510
Gone by loved ones, a little sunshine, every now and then.

01:08.951 --> 01:26.333
There are mountains in my life so hard to climb, that I promised I would keep climbing if you would only.

01:26.617 --> 01:55.999
Let me in I am willing Lord to run All the way All the way All the way I am willing Lord to run All the way

01:56.890 --> 02:05.539
If I fall down while I'm trying, don't be angry.

02:07.662 --> 02:08.903
Let me stay.

02:10.765 --> 02:20.856
I am willing, Lord, to run all the way.
