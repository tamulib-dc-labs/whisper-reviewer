WEBVTT

00:02.039 --> 00:06.504
This song is sung by Mrs. Rady Noon on the banks of Cloudy in Springfield, Missouri.

00:07.304 --> 00:09.006
June the 5th, 1939.

00:10.327 --> 00:31.489
As I stepped out one evening T'was in the month of May Down by a flower garden I happened to stray I overheard a female When sorrow did complain Of a foreign absent lover

00:32.043 --> 00:34.867
Who'd ploughed the distant mane.

00:36.069 --> 00:40.335
I stepped up to her, I took her on surprise.

00:40.916 --> 00:46.303
I knew she wouldn't know me, for I was in disguise.

00:46.884 --> 00:51.771
Oh, where are you going, my own heart she liked.

00:52.272 --> 00:58.000
Oh, where are you going, this dark and rainy night.

00:58.250 --> 01:03.636
I'm hunting for a young man, young Johnny is his name.

01:03.676 --> 01:09.303
On the banks of Floddy, I'm told he does remain.

01:10.204 --> 01:15.070
On the banks of Floddy, if you would please to show.

01:15.711 --> 01:21.658
And pity a poor female, for there I'm bound to go.

01:22.465 --> 01:27.250
On the banks of Sladee, on which you now descend.

01:27.711 --> 01:33.537
But never mind young Johnny, for he's a false young man.

01:34.057 --> 01:39.483
Oh, never mind young Johnny, for he'll not meet you here.

01:40.184 --> 01:46.110
Just stay with me in the greenwood, no danger need you fear.

01:46.090 --> 01:50.997
If Johnny was here this night, he'd free me from all harm.

01:51.477 --> 01:56.544
But he's on the field of battle dressed in his uniform.

01:57.245 --> 02:02.432
He's on the field of battle for Honor Andres Gay.

02:02.853 --> 02:08.841
The ship's been wrecked, so I've been told, all on her way from Spain.

02:17.242 --> 02:22.211
When she heard this dreadful news, she fell into despair.

02:22.712 --> 02:32.911
With wringing of her hands and tearing of her hair, saying, if Johnny's drunk, no other will I pay.

02:33.392 --> 02:38.642
Through the lonesome hills and valleys, I'll rumble for this day.
