00:02.950 --> 00:07.836
This is a little folk ballad from the Appalachian Mountains, Goodbye Little Bonnie Blue Eyes.

00:07.856 --> 00:13.383
It's one of my favorite ballads, sung by May Kennedy McCord, June the 5th, 1939.

00:13.423 --> 00:21.714
Oh, I wish I was a beautiful bird.

00:21.734 --> 00:26.961
I would not fly so high.

00:26.981 --> 00:30.325
I'd build me a nest on the tomb.

00:30.946 --> 00:37.693
Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes.

00:37.713 --> 00:42.038
Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes.

00:43.039 --> 00:47.384
Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes.

00:48.505 --> 00:53.951
I'll see you again, but God knows when.

00:54.312 --> 00:58.196
Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes.

00:58.216 --> 01:10.248
I'm going on the ocean blue, where the mountains reach the sky.

01:10.248 --> 01:15.862
On the ocean blue, I'll be thinking about you.

01:15.882 --> 01:19.651
Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes.

01:22.378 --> 01:37.585
Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes. I'll see you again, but God knows when.

01:37.585 --> 01:40.448
Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes.

01:41.329 --> 01:48.537
Oh, lay your hand in mine.

01:48.557 --> 01:53.983
Oh, lay your hand in mine.

01:54.003 --> 02:04.836
If you love me like I love you, honey, lay your hand in mine.

02:04.856 --> 02:15.402
Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes. Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes.

02:15.402 --> 02:21.796
I'll see you again, but God knows when.

02:21.816 --> 02:26.627
Goodbye, little bonnie blue eyes.
