00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
[Music.]

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Louise

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
You're the sweetest girl I know.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Louise

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
You're the sweetest girl I know.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
You made me walk for Chicago

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
to the Gulf of Mexico.

00:53.000 --> 01:10.000
I'd love to have...now what're you're trying to do? To get some other man to love and be true?

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
You know, Louise...

01:26.212 --> 01:28.195
...and love me. And love some other men too.

01:38.872 --> 01:40.655
Louise, I've seen somebody.

01:41.697 --> 01:43.440
Been wading in my pond.

01:44.682 --> 01:47.546
Been catching all my possessions.

01:47.566 --> 01:50.952
...up the pond.

01:51.773 --> 01:52.354
Louise.

01:55.625 --> 01:56.489
Baby, why don't you hurry home?

02:02.000 --> 02:11.000
And I know that my Louise is gone.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
I got a girl named Viola, treats me nice and kind.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
...Louise is on my mind.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.491
She's not so good looking and her hair ain't even red.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.258
You cook my breakfast.

02:35.278 --> 02:37.562
And bring it to the bed.

02:39.406 --> 02:43.854
Louise, why don't you hurry home?
