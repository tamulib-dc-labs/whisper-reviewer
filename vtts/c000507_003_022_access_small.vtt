WEBVTT

00:01.320 --> 00:08.720
Okay, we're rolling to Venice, and let's start off with how did the, one more thing,

00:09.780 --> 00:16.140
whenever you're talking, I shut my line down so that I don't get any interference on this

00:16.140 --> 00:19.200
end, so maybe a few seconds after you start talking before I come back on.

00:19.740 --> 00:20.120
Okay.

00:20.680 --> 00:24.620
Okay, let's start out with how did that crystal movie project get started?

00:25.820 --> 00:36.980
Well, I first began on Dark Crystal just over five years ago, and I took the idea of doing

00:36.980 --> 00:42.980
a film like this to Lou Grade, who was the man responsible for putting the Muppet Show

00:42.980 --> 00:47.700
in the air, and suggested that we do a film.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.020
He loved the idea, and he said, but why don't we do a film first with the regular Muppet

00:52.020 --> 00:52.560
Show characters?

00:53.440 --> 01:00.740
So that became the Muppet movie, but he said, you know, Grade will do the Dark Crystal also.

01:01.320 --> 01:08.840
So we started it way back then, and then I was working with Brian Fraud on this concept.

01:09.500 --> 01:14.240
We continued to work for the next few years putting Dark Crystal together.

01:18.460 --> 01:19.020
Okay.

01:21.560 --> 01:26.200
How did that, could you go into a little bit of detail of how the story went about?

01:28.600 --> 01:37.140
Well, let's see, the story of Dark Crystal came pretty much from all of the, it grew

01:37.140 --> 01:41.200
out of conversations with my daughters, probably most of all.

01:42.920 --> 01:47.860
Lisa and I were talking about the idea of doing a mythic fairy tale.

01:48.920 --> 01:54.200
We had just done the characters for Saturday Night Live, and we found that was sort of

01:54.200 --> 01:57.040
an interesting departure for us.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.780
The characters were more realistic.

02:01.340 --> 02:03.040
We used Taxi Dermas to eyes.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.600
They looked more like real living creatures, and we thought, wouldn't it be interesting

02:08.600 --> 02:13.780
to take this a little bit further so that we end up with something that actually looks

02:14.490 --> 02:18.160
like a living breathing thing and set it in a whole fantasy world?

02:18.760 --> 02:21.620
So that was kind of the challenge, was to create this entire world.

02:23.220 --> 02:26.100
And about that time I brought Brian Fraud into it.

02:27.600 --> 02:34.840
We operated for the first year on just the biggest development, knowing basically what

02:34.840 --> 02:40.280
the story was going to be about, and what I wanted to design the characters first.

02:41.500 --> 02:46.560
Then after we had the characters together, the storyline grew.

02:48.780 --> 02:57.200
Actually, I was looking for a time to actually put this story down, to write it down.

02:57.600 --> 03:03.220
I needed a couple of days clear, and I was about to fly over to England with my daughter,

03:03.220 --> 03:07.040
Cheryl, who was about 60 or 17, I guess, at the time.

03:08.220 --> 03:11.440
We got stranded at Kennedy Airport in a blizzard.

03:12.080 --> 03:18.620
We were stuck at Howard Johnson's motor lodge for two days in the blizzard of 77.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.260
During those two days, we had a wonderful time.

03:24.640 --> 03:30.860
During that time, we put the basic working story together that did become the story

03:30.860 --> 03:32.220
outline for The Dark Crystal.

03:36.380 --> 03:40.520
Okay, that's sort of a part of the fun, sort of a family affair.

03:41.720 --> 03:47.080
Yes, well, I tended to always work with my kids quite a bit, I think.

03:51.860 --> 03:56.840
Okay, just to give a little bit of a background, what types of characters or creatures

03:56.840 --> 03:58.400
inhabit the world with The Dark Crystal?

03:59.740 --> 04:05.780
Well, they're very different from anything that we've ever done.

04:06.300 --> 04:13.080
For that reason, we are not using the name Muppets in connection with this film,

04:14.720 --> 04:22.020
or even puppetry, because it's something rather different from either Muppets or Puppets,

04:22.300 --> 04:23.780
in that these are creatures.

04:24.800 --> 04:31.320
Some of the creatures are small, I can't puppet, but some of them are great, big, large things.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.120
With people inside, they weigh 75 pounds.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.840
They're bigger, there are some things that are about 10 feet tall.

04:40.620 --> 04:43.660
So we're into all kinds of different creatures.

04:44.760 --> 04:50.640
They were all designed by Brian Fraud, who's the English fantasy illustrator.

04:51.700 --> 05:00.000
Brian has done just a wonderful job of designing both creatures, their costumes, the entire world,

05:00.740 --> 05:06.340
the landscape, the cathals, all of that was designed by Brian.

05:07.300 --> 05:11.780
But it has a very different look, and it doesn't look anything like anything we've ever done before.

05:15.940 --> 05:19.260
I'll take it Brian, storyboarded the idea down in.

05:21.280 --> 05:27.500
He was doing design work, but actually we had other people doing storyboards for the whole film.

05:29.300 --> 05:29.780
Okay.

05:33.180 --> 05:36.800
Last week you talked a little bit about the design of the creatures.

05:36.980 --> 05:40.960
Could you go into that just a little bit more, possibly how

05:42.520 --> 05:44.380
they're manufactured or how they're put together?

05:46.040 --> 05:52.720
Well, the normal process and the reason that it took a number of years to accomplish this,

05:52.880 --> 05:57.340
was that Brian would do an original sketch.

05:58.820 --> 06:06.380
Then we would go to have one of our sculptors then sculpt the figure.

06:06.380 --> 06:12.080
Then we would mock it up so that we could manipulate it.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.040
Then we would try moving this thing.

06:15.340 --> 06:17.920
These things moved in different ways.

06:19.620 --> 06:21.640
We would videotape a test.

06:22.980 --> 06:27.760
Then we'd all sit around and look at the test and decide what should be done about it.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.840
Then Brian would normally redesign the character.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.560
The whole process would begin again.

06:34.220 --> 06:42.220
We would go through sometimes like five generations of the character before we ended up with what we actually shot on film.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.660
That's one of the reasons it was a long development time.

06:49.620 --> 06:59.480
Could you go back to creating all new creatures yet making them realistic enough so that when somebody looked at it and make it accept them as being a creature?

06:59.480 --> 07:00.160
Yes.

07:00.780 --> 07:06.800
The whole problem was whether or not we could design a world that the audience would believe.

07:08.040 --> 07:12.320
You would believe that this was a world with all of the depth.

07:13.980 --> 07:20.660
In our own world there are so many things that you look around and you accept a very complicated world.

07:21.860 --> 07:24.360
But all of these things have a sort of a depth to them.

07:24.380 --> 07:26.660
There's a lot of stuff behind everything.

07:29.200 --> 07:43.940
In that sense, Brian went about designing these creatures, the whole culture, the symbolism behind the different kinds of creatures and their lifestyles.

07:44.540 --> 07:51.480
We would spend a lot of time sitting around talking about what these people ate and how they ate.

07:52.300 --> 08:00.060
We would act towards each other and the kind of clothes that are evil creatures.

08:01.800 --> 08:08.440
They are skinny bony creatures and we figured they are nearly a thousand years old.

08:09.660 --> 08:14.760
They were layer upon layer upon layer of clothing and we figured they never took their clothes off.

08:15.020 --> 08:19.800
They only added a new layer on top and it was all kind of really awful.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.960
We figured it probably smelled terrible.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.940
But it was all brocade and very rich fabrics.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.460
It's that kind of thing.

08:32.760 --> 08:37.680
You go through the thinking process of what this evolution was.

08:37.940 --> 08:46.660
You do that not only for the creatures but for their environment and the places where they live.

08:49.800 --> 08:54.520
We've talked with a lot of science fiction and fantasy authors about world building concepts.

08:54.740 --> 09:01.160
They find that sometimes designing and building the world is the challenge of doing that.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.000
That is more exciting than the actual story that comes about afterwards.

09:05.200 --> 09:09.360
All of this for us kind of happened at the same time.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.700
It was kind of a joint thing.

09:18.860 --> 09:26.180
The story is very much an organic part of how these creatures are and the trouble they are in at the moment.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.200
The story begins when this world is at a point of crisis.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.200
Our story is very much part of the whole thing.

09:38.220 --> 09:38.700
Yeah.

09:41.940 --> 09:46.660
What I meant was when they're designing the world,

09:48.500 --> 09:54.880
lots of times when they get to the story afterwards they have to work very hard in order to make the story as exciting as the world is designed.

09:57.340 --> 10:00.440
I can see that as a potential hitfall.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.960
We got into things where it would be lovely.

10:05.620 --> 10:12.180
We spent a lot of time working on areas of the film that never got photographed even.

10:12.940 --> 10:16.440
We worked a great deal on what the plant life was like.

10:17.580 --> 10:22.500
We had many kinds of plants that were sort of halfway between plants and animals.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.200
We had these trees that would walk around.

10:25.760 --> 10:30.360
We had all areas of the mud that was alive.

10:31.680 --> 10:35.000
Most of that stuff did not end up in the finished film.

10:36.760 --> 10:42.440
When you are doing a story, the story has to take precedence.

10:43.020 --> 10:47.640
Lots of that stuff is also serving a useful function to the story that you're telling.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.060
It doesn't end up in the film.

10:53.760 --> 10:58.800
From our standpoint, it was very valuable to have gone through this process to know what's there.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.160
We know what's on the other side of that tree that you're not seeing.

11:03.920 --> 11:12.720
Yeah, that would make it the realism as the scene came to life for you.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.600
You'd better pass that on when you're filming this.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.020
Otherwise, you end up with just a surface.

11:18.780 --> 11:25.560
I think we have something here that has more depth to it because of the time we put into that.

11:28.320 --> 11:33.900
Can we talk a little bit about the different types of churches, the Skeksus and the Gelflings?

11:34.320 --> 11:39.820
Yeah, the Gelflings are sort of the closest thing to human beings.

11:39.820 --> 11:45.240
There's a young male and female Gelfling, which are the leads, really.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.100
The story revolves around them.

11:48.160 --> 11:51.800
I was performing Jen, the male Gelfling.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.160
Then we have the Mystics.

11:57.620 --> 12:01.080
The Mystics are sort of big ancient old wizards.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.260
There's nine of them.

12:04.060 --> 12:06.620
They live in a area called Mystic Valley.

12:06.620 --> 12:10.260
They've raised Jen from a baby.

12:12.680 --> 12:17.000
Kira, the female Gelfling, was raised by the Pod People.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.260
These are sort of like the peasants that live out in the woods.

12:23.540 --> 12:26.260
The bad guys are the Skeksus.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.980
There are nine of them also.

12:28.880 --> 12:33.320
These are these ancient creatures that have been inhabiting the castle.

12:34.440 --> 12:40.820
They are in control of the land because they also control the dark crystal,

12:41.260 --> 12:46.440
which is this very large crystal that floats inside the castle.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.560
Let's see what else.

12:53.080 --> 12:59.620
The Skeksus have sort of a troop of soldiers, which are called Garthum.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.660
Are we okay with that sound?

13:03.900 --> 13:07.700
It's a bit. I can filter some of that out, I think, when we're reprocessed.

13:08.740 --> 13:11.020
That's very strange. Is it on the line or is that in your recorder?

13:11.660 --> 13:14.380
It must be on the line between here and New York.

13:15.580 --> 13:16.500
Do you want me to call you back?

13:17.500 --> 13:19.420
If you want to, I can call you back. It doesn't matter.

13:21.340 --> 13:22.940
Okay, we'll call you back. What do they call you?

13:23.380 --> 13:27.520
And you're, let's see, still 335-6647?

13:27.520 --> 13:32.680
Let me go ahead and give you the studio number. It's 335-6648.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.900
Okay, I'll call you right back.

13:36.140 --> 13:36.300
All right.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.940
Okay, remember that the recorder is going again here.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.560
It's a different kind of noise over here.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.800
Yeah, we're getting a good signal here.

13:51.720 --> 13:54.400
We just got through talking about the various creatures.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.740
You and Frank, I was co-director of the pictures.

13:59.020 --> 14:00.220
Is that right? Yes, that's right.

14:01.420 --> 14:06.340
How does one co-direct the picture?

14:07.280 --> 14:10.300
Well, we were both performing in this film,

14:10.580 --> 14:13.640
which is one of the reasons that co-directing made sense,

14:13.800 --> 14:18.960
because when you're inside a set and you're actually performing,

14:20.120 --> 14:22.040
it's rather difficult to

14:22.720 --> 14:26.400
be the person outside that's running the film unit

14:26.400 --> 14:29.480
and also seeing the scene with a sense of perspective.

14:29.940 --> 14:33.740
So we found it very useful. Generally, if I was performing,

14:34.040 --> 14:37.180
Frank was kind of running things, and vice versa.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.720
And we worked very closely together

14:42.720 --> 14:45.200
throughout the whole pre-production and post-production.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.800
And Frank and I have worked together for many years, so it's not

14:49.800 --> 14:53.620
an uncomfortable thing at all. We think very much alike.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.020
And our image of the snow, I think, was

14:57.720 --> 15:01.500
something that we shared the feelings of.

15:01.780 --> 15:03.620
So it was quite an easy process.

15:06.620 --> 15:07.180
Okay.

15:09.800 --> 15:13.300
I read up and researched, and I moved us all, especially on PBS,

15:13.640 --> 15:17.500
not long ago, on that you hosted on Puppetry.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.720
And it went into how you all produced the show and everything.

15:20.900 --> 15:24.960
But could you give a little bit of a sort of visual explanation

15:24.960 --> 15:26.780
of what it's like on the set?

15:27.900 --> 15:33.200
Well, let's see. Because we were operating most of these characters from below,

15:33.960 --> 15:37.920
the sets were all built about four feet off the floor.

15:40.220 --> 15:42.220
And we would be operating

15:42.220 --> 15:46.140
with a...or sometimes through holes

15:46.140 --> 15:49.420
on the floor, or sometimes the character would be there.

15:49.860 --> 15:53.640
And there would be several people around

15:54.420 --> 15:57.520
operating cables going to one particular character.

15:58.520 --> 16:02.160
If you saw the credits on ET, so how many people

16:02.160 --> 16:05.820
were credited with operating ET. And we had

16:05.820 --> 16:09.140
dozens of characters that were all about that complicated.

16:09.780 --> 16:14.420
So you could imagine we would have lots and lots of performers.

16:15.220 --> 16:18.060
And we were always using a video system

16:18.060 --> 16:20.800
up through the last television camera.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.900
So we would be operating with television monitors.

16:26.020 --> 16:28.680
If I was inside of a character operating,

16:29.460 --> 16:32.280
I would be wearing a television monitor on my chest.

16:33.100 --> 16:36.680
And all the other people who were helping to operate that same character

16:36.680 --> 16:39.400
would also be watching television monitors.

16:39.400 --> 16:43.780
So it was that kind of a

16:43.780 --> 16:44.920
process.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.700
That sort of high tech

16:51.700 --> 16:54.820
industry. Yes, yes.

16:55.140 --> 16:59.500
We were using a lot of different kinds of technical

16:59.500 --> 17:02.520
and special effect.

17:03.240 --> 17:07.280
Mechanisms, radio control, marionette rigs,

17:07.280 --> 17:10.100
all of these things. But basically they're all

17:11.660 --> 17:14.880
ways of assisting the performer create a

17:14.880 --> 17:18.920
performance. So despite the fact that it's high tech,

17:19.680 --> 17:21.400
I really think of it as

17:24.220 --> 17:26.380
assisting a performance to happen.

17:26.780 --> 17:30.920
Because that is what everything revolves around.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.720
And the quality of the performance itself.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.660
Yes, that's very good. Very good explanation.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.060
Let's see. This was filmed during the England, right?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.760
Yes, we were shooting in the Elstree Studios,

17:47.620 --> 17:51.960
the same ones that have done Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Art.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.200
We did the great Muppet Caper there also.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.800
Why was it shot over in England? Any particular reason?

18:00.540 --> 18:03.480
Mostly because we were there doing the Muppet show

18:04.360 --> 18:07.520
also in Elstree. This film studio

18:07.520 --> 18:11.520
was about two blocks from where we were working. And I wanted to go straight

18:11.520 --> 18:15.180
from the end of the Muppet show into the great Muppet Caper.

18:15.380 --> 18:19.280
So while we were still doing that television show, we were doing the pre-production

18:19.280 --> 18:23.180
for the movie. If I

18:23.180 --> 18:26.980
decided to do that in the United States, we probably would have had to

18:26.980 --> 18:30.340
do it about eight months later.

18:34.020 --> 18:34.760
You're talking

18:34.760 --> 18:38.440
a little while about some of the scenes and how you had to work from a hole

18:38.440 --> 18:42.020
underneath the set and stuff like that. Did you have, I enjoyed reading a description

18:42.020 --> 18:46.400
of how you manipulated Kermit when you were doing

18:46.400 --> 18:49.240
the Muppet movie, the first scene in the swamp?

18:50.080 --> 18:53.400
Did you have any scenes that were as difficult as

18:54.600 --> 18:58.120
Manning, what was it, the USS Henson submarine that you were in?

18:58.820 --> 19:02.740
Well let's see, I don't think, we never had anything, it was quite that

19:04.460 --> 19:05.020
claustrophobic.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.300
I mean fortunately I'm not a claustrophobic person, so I don't

19:10.300 --> 19:12.380
mind being sprinted into a small space.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.660
But in the Muppet movie, in the great Muppet Caper,

19:18.180 --> 19:21.840
we would very often find ourselves in a situation where we were

19:21.840 --> 19:25.980
out in the real world, like riding in a

19:25.980 --> 19:29.880
taxi cab, where there might be three or four of us sort of jammed underneath

19:29.880 --> 19:34.460
where the seat would have been in a regular automobile.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.040
But since this film was all in a fantasy

19:38.040 --> 19:41.800
world, which was designed for us to operate in, we

19:41.800 --> 19:44.240
virtually never had that same kind of discomfort.

19:45.540 --> 19:49.640
So all of our sets were designed with knowing that we wanted

19:49.640 --> 19:53.900
to be able to get underneath the ground, or through

19:53.900 --> 19:57.920
a rock wall, and so all of it was designed

19:57.920 --> 20:01.720
with trap doors or areas that could be

20:01.720 --> 20:03.040
removed.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.120
Yeah, okay.

20:09.640 --> 20:13.360
The basic premise behind the story is

20:13.900 --> 20:17.320
I guess what the eternal concept between good and evil?

20:18.160 --> 20:21.240
Well it's that sort of thing, it's

20:21.240 --> 20:23.960
the basic story really relates to

20:23.960 --> 20:28.240
a young man growing up

20:29.240 --> 20:33.180
facing the world, facing the evil

20:33.180 --> 20:37.020
powers and the unknown, and conquering fear.

20:37.780 --> 20:40.820
So in that sense it's a very standard thing,

20:41.620 --> 20:44.060
standard fairy tale myth,

20:44.740 --> 20:48.440
basic story. But then on top of that I think

20:49.860 --> 20:52.100
the actual story that we're telling is

20:53.100 --> 20:55.680
interesting and has sort of its own

20:56.740 --> 20:58.840
strange variations of this world.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.900
Yeah, I'm reading Brian's book.

21:06.580 --> 21:09.180
I think people are really going to be able to get into the characters

21:09.180 --> 21:10.780
because of how well they're all developed.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.100
I hope so, yeah, but that is certainly our

21:16.100 --> 21:17.920
desire, our intent.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.700
Okay, one last question here on Dark Crystal.

21:23.960 --> 21:28.340
Because of all the work you did on developing the characters in the world, anything like that,

21:30.040 --> 21:31.960
do you think there might be

21:31.960 --> 21:34.940
another Dark Crystal movie somewhere in the future?

21:35.900 --> 21:39.560
Well the story itself is complete in itself

21:40.040 --> 21:44.040
and so it doesn't lend itself to Dark Crystal 2.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.520
I don't think there will be a sequel as such.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.880
We could have another story in this same world.

21:50.660 --> 21:55.520
But I think we're kind of waiting until after this film opens to see how we feel about that.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.560
Yeah, they really

21:59.740 --> 22:03.200
they've had several fantasy movies after the summer that

22:03.960 --> 22:07.040
none of them really seem to capture the genre.

22:07.300 --> 22:11.680
In fact I guess one of the last and best was The Wizard of Oz and that was quite a lot of it.

22:11.680 --> 22:15.460
So in that sense I really hope you're successful with that because

22:15.460 --> 22:18.100
I really enjoyed the fantasy stories.

22:18.760 --> 22:24.180
Yes, to us it was a wonderful challenge. It was something we had a great time doing.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.640
And whether or not we

22:27.640 --> 22:31.800
are or we will be successful at it is something I have no

22:31.800 --> 22:35.560
idea yet. We won't really know until this whole moment.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.440
Yeah, sort of a calculated gamble in that sense.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.140
Yeah.

22:45.340 --> 22:46.560
You still have time?

22:48.880 --> 22:51.080
Well, I'm late but okay.

22:52.220 --> 22:56.360
I wanted to get a little bit of background information on how you got started

22:56.360 --> 23:00.080
and the various programs that you worked on and stuff like that.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.800
We can make this brief if you'd like.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.820
The first question of course is how did you get started in all this?

23:09.380 --> 23:12.140
Well, I started just out of high school

23:12.820 --> 23:15.240
on local television in Washington DC.

23:16.540 --> 23:19.960
I started doing a little puppet show there that was on

23:19.960 --> 23:24.440
late at night. It was an 11, 25 in the evening, 5 minute show.

23:25.060 --> 23:27.300
And I had that show while I was going to college

23:28.560 --> 23:30.400
for the next few years.

23:31.480 --> 23:35.320
And during that time the style of the puppet sort of came together.

23:35.320 --> 23:39.280
Then I moved up to New York and started doing guest shots on

23:40.080 --> 23:41.280
variety shows.

23:42.240 --> 23:46.240
The Jimmy Dean show, which is a country western show with our dog Rolf,

23:47.200 --> 23:51.140
we did that for three years. We did the Ed Sullivan show for a while.

23:51.460 --> 23:53.960
And about that time Sesame Street came along.

23:55.840 --> 23:59.300
Sesame Street, we're in the process of working

23:59.300 --> 24:03.200
on our 14th season right now. So that's something

24:03.200 --> 24:05.320
that is still a part of our operation here.

24:07.340 --> 24:09.580
The Muppet Show came along

24:11.060 --> 24:13.220
about like seven years ago I guess.

24:14.840 --> 24:18.700
We did the Muppet Show. We did five years of that, which was

24:18.700 --> 24:22.800
120 shows. And there's first and all of this

24:22.800 --> 24:27.080
for the recent Century Television Special. A lot of guest shots.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.300
That sort of brings us up

24:30.300 --> 24:31.960
to date I guess.

24:34.660 --> 24:35.540
I suppose

24:38.800 --> 24:41.660
I guess it's kind of funny, but wasn't

24:41.660 --> 24:43.700
Robert Beckey really put you on the map?

24:46.240 --> 24:48.960
Which one? Remember the song, Robert Beckey?

24:50.900 --> 24:54.380
Isn't that sort of it really put you on the map and grabbed a public attention?

24:54.700 --> 24:56.360
I never would have thought of that.

24:57.740 --> 25:00.400
It may have. Robert Beckey

25:01.240 --> 25:04.320
came up in the first season of

25:04.320 --> 25:08.600
Sesame Street. And I think it

25:08.600 --> 25:12.060
made it close to the top ten. Not quite all.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.460
I don't think it got up to about number ten.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.100
I don't think it got any higher than that nationally.

25:18.980 --> 25:23.100
I think probably Sesame Street itself was

25:24.580 --> 25:26.880
something that the general audience

25:26.880 --> 25:30.320
became aware of before that.

25:30.540 --> 25:33.560
But I think we were mostly known in the industry I guess.

25:35.600 --> 25:39.120
I can remember watching Sesame Street when it came out and really enjoying

25:39.120 --> 25:42.900
your work because the humor that you put into it

25:42.900 --> 25:47.020
seemed to be written on two levels. The both would laugh at one thing

25:47.020 --> 25:48.260
and the kids would laugh at another.

25:48.260 --> 25:52.080
That was a fairly conscious decision

25:52.080 --> 25:56.060
that we've always known that

25:56.060 --> 25:59.080
the television set is controlled by

25:59.080 --> 26:04.620
not only the little kids but also their parents and their older brothers and sisters.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.260
That sort of thing.

26:08.840 --> 26:12.100
Could you give a brief reason

26:12.100 --> 26:15.980
as to why you designed the Muppets rather than working with traditional puppets

26:15.980 --> 26:16.720
or marionettes?

26:18.440 --> 26:23.040
Well, let's see. I don't know.

26:23.660 --> 26:25.560
When I started,

26:27.680 --> 26:31.480
let's see. I started with no connection with any normal

26:31.480 --> 26:33.220
puppeteers or anything.

26:35.240 --> 26:40.040
So I guess not having a background in it

26:40.040 --> 26:42.860
nor knowing hardly anything about it, I started in

26:43.740 --> 26:45.320
probably a fresh direction

26:46.920 --> 26:50.300
coming mostly from just a different place I suppose.

26:52.660 --> 26:55.320
You suppose it might have been that you're working

26:55.320 --> 26:59.080
in the medium of television that caused you to use the design where you could

26:59.080 --> 27:02.600
have more, I guess, facial expression on your characters

27:02.600 --> 27:06.340
rather than as a static expression on marionettes or not? Yeah, oh certainly.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.340
Certainly. The fact that we, all of our original characters were designed just for television.

27:11.340 --> 27:14.980
We were probably one of the first people

27:14.980 --> 27:17.940
to do that because even

27:17.940 --> 27:21.540
Bert Tilstrom, whose work I had seen

27:21.540 --> 27:27.020
and probably he was likely the major influence on me, I suppose.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.680
But even his work had started before television.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.960
And so it wasn't particularly designed

27:34.960 --> 27:36.180
for the medium.

27:40.740 --> 27:41.540
Okay.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.900
When did you meet Frank Oz

27:44.900 --> 27:49.020
and form that sort of collaborative effort with him?

27:50.040 --> 27:52.340
Frank joined us about in 1960.

27:55.780 --> 27:58.820
Oh, maybe 1964 or

27:58.820 --> 28:02.240
five just before we started doing the Jimmy Dean show.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.660
He was a kid at the time.

28:07.140 --> 28:08.540
So he was with me

28:08.540 --> 28:11.040
in a lot of the early days of our development.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.040
And then as well, he started doing voices.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.380
A lot of his voice things really came into

28:20.200 --> 28:23.520
really great shape about the time we started on Sesame Street.

28:28.060 --> 28:29.780
Yeah, I think Frank's name

28:29.780 --> 28:31.780
was just highly appropriate for what he does.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.040
Speaking of voices,

28:36.860 --> 28:38.880
I know this, but this is just for the audience.

28:39.060 --> 28:42.560
Who has which voices that are really popular characters?

28:43.540 --> 28:47.100
Well, it's the Frank Oz, Fawzi Bear and Fawzi

28:47.100 --> 28:48.860
who was sort of named for Frank Oz.

28:49.120 --> 28:56.000
But Frank does Fawzi and Figgie, Animal, Sam Eagle,

28:57.760 --> 28:58.560
on the Muppet Show,

28:58.560 --> 29:02.100
on Sesame Street he does Cookie Monster, Grover,

29:03.340 --> 29:06.900
Bert, and in Dark Crystal

29:06.900 --> 29:10.120
he's doing a character named Ogre

29:11.540 --> 29:13.700
and he does the Chamberlain.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.000
So those are two of the major characters in the Dark Crystal.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.340
Say, what else?

29:22.520 --> 29:25.780
I do a character named Jen in the Dark Crystal

29:25.780 --> 29:29.980
and I was also performing one of the Skeksis, the Ritual Master.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.140
More or less an incidental character.

29:35.220 --> 29:36.960
On the Muppet Show I do Kermit,

29:39.620 --> 29:41.620
Rolf, Waldorf, the Chef,

29:43.220 --> 29:46.020
a few others like Dr. T.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.380
On Sesame Street the only characters I'm doing there

29:50.380 --> 29:54.960
are Ernie, Kermit the Frog,

29:54.960 --> 29:57.160
who occasionally works on Sesame Street still.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.180
You and Frank are about money, right?

30:06.800 --> 30:08.180
Yes, we're trying. Okay.

30:09.540 --> 30:12.820
How do you know the Muppet world?

30:14.180 --> 30:18.760
Yes, we've been doing that for a long time and it's still fun. We still have a good time doing that stuff.

30:19.500 --> 30:22.560
It comes to this, I can remember, I don't even remember

30:22.560 --> 30:26.500
where I saw this, but I thought it was on the Muppet Show because it was on, excuse me,

30:26.600 --> 30:29.740
the Sesame Street. It was a segment where the

30:29.740 --> 30:34.540
Swedish Chef was making a sandwich and the subtitles

30:34.540 --> 30:35.580
were all in Chinese.

30:36.960 --> 30:42.840
Well, that was the first time we used the Swedish Chef and that was something

30:42.840 --> 30:44.520
I'm quite sure this was

30:46.720 --> 30:49.280
on a pilot special we did for ABC

30:50.700 --> 30:52.400
many years ago. It was called Muppet Show.

30:53.700 --> 30:57.700
Okay, that was, I remember laughing so hard that I cried

30:57.700 --> 30:59.720
when I saw that. That was so hilarious.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.460
I've got to look at that too. I haven't seen that show in a long time.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.200
Okay, well, I think I've covered

31:08.960 --> 31:13.380
I have a guess here. If I was going to make a guess, I would guess that you

31:13.380 --> 31:15.760
were a computer games fan. Would I be guessing right?

31:16.920 --> 31:18.860
It's interesting, not particularly.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.580
I grew up playing a lot of games

31:25.380 --> 31:27.740
and I enjoy computer games, but I

31:27.740 --> 31:31.660
sort of never get around to doing it. I guess I have a busy life and I

31:31.660 --> 31:35.020
don't, you know, we had an Atari,

31:35.540 --> 31:39.700
we have an Atari unit at home for the kids, which I've enjoyed playing some of

31:39.700 --> 31:42.200
those games, but I haven't really gotten into it.

31:44.780 --> 31:46.360
Okay, missed my mark,

31:46.460 --> 31:50.160
what can I say? If a person was interested

31:52.280 --> 31:54.280
in doing what you do or going

31:54.280 --> 31:58.040
to work for somebody like you, what type of area would they study in,

31:58.160 --> 32:00.600
work in, do, what type of person are you looking for?

32:02.980 --> 32:06.320
Well, I don't know. It's different kinds of things. There's a performer

32:06.320 --> 32:08.920
for performers, I look for people who have

32:11.220 --> 32:13.100
a sense of humor,

32:13.560 --> 32:15.080
a sense of humor and a kind of

32:15.080 --> 32:20.520
ability of performing and focusing their performance in their

32:20.520 --> 32:24.600
hands. There's specific things one looks for in terms of

32:24.600 --> 32:25.260
puppeteering.

32:28.740 --> 32:32.640
But, you know, the whole film business

32:32.640 --> 32:34.660
right now is a very exciting time.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.060
Everybody is on the lookout for people with a lot of talent.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.400
Okay, well I'll take that

32:46.400 --> 32:49.940
plenty of your time there. Certainly do appreciate you taking time not to talk with me.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.060
Okay, good Dave. It was a pleasure. Okay, whenever we get the tapes cut together

32:54.060 --> 32:57.440
I'll send you a copy of the completed shows. Great, that would be very nice.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.340
Okay, thank you. Thank you very much Mr. Hansen. Bye-bye.
