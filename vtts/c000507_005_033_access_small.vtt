00:01.100 --> 00:06.140
When we talk about different stories that you've written, feel free to give any background

00:06.140 --> 00:09.900
information on the story because many of the people listening probably haven't read some

00:09.900 --> 00:10.260
of them.

00:11.420 --> 00:14.000
And that's always a good way to plug something.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.560
They get interested enough in the story to go out and buy it and read it.

00:16.680 --> 00:16.940
Right.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.080
Try to do that.

00:19.540 --> 00:19.980
Okay.

00:21.140 --> 00:23.820
Okay, we'll crank off with a real biggie question here.

00:25.140 --> 00:25.580
Okay.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.760
How did you get started writing science fiction?

00:28.900 --> 00:31.880
Well, there are sort of two versions of that in a way.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.440
There's my official writing career, which began after I first got married to Werner

00:37.440 --> 00:39.540
Benji, my now ex-husband.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.520
He was a science fiction writer at the time.

00:42.920 --> 00:48.200
And I had been a person who fooled around with writing for a while before that.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.060
I would just fiddle around with it.

00:50.100 --> 00:55.300
I used to want to be an artist and writing was just something I did kind of privately

00:55.300 --> 00:58.240
and never showed to anybody and rarely finished anything either.

00:58.840 --> 01:03.100
But Werner encouraged me to take it seriously if I was going to write.

01:03.220 --> 01:07.420
By that time I had abandoned wanting to be an artist because my college art professors

01:07.420 --> 01:09.720
had ruined my desire to do art.

01:10.280 --> 01:14.840
And I was sort of casting about and he knew that I liked to write.

01:15.100 --> 01:20.400
And so he encouraged me to attempt to take it seriously and sit down and do something

01:20.400 --> 01:21.140
and finish it.

01:22.540 --> 01:27.780
And so I decided that I would take him up on this and I started doing a story which

01:27.780 --> 01:30.360
turned out to be the first story that I sold.

01:30.540 --> 01:31.660
It was called Tin Soldier.

01:33.600 --> 01:37.140
And when I started writing it, I didn't know if I'd ever get it finished or anything,

01:37.300 --> 01:41.280
but I did get it finished and I showed it to him and he said he thought it was saleable.

01:41.860 --> 01:44.940
And so I started sending it out and I did sell it.

01:45.260 --> 01:46.840
And after that I was hooked, of course.

01:47.180 --> 01:49.180
I wanted to go on being a writer.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.080
The bumps are getting the better of us here.

01:54.960 --> 01:58.980
Let me call you back here before we do our second question so we can get a better line

01:58.980 --> 01:59.420
on the phone.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.460
I'll call you back in about two or three minutes.

02:01.740 --> 02:02.580
Okay, bye.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.580
We'll roll it and try it again.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.880
Let's do a voice test here.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.320
Is the weather still good?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.320
Yes, I've changed the dress.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.460
It's very nice to sunny out.

02:14.580 --> 02:14.980
Okay.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.260
We're not picking up quite as well on this line.

02:18.060 --> 02:19.940
No pops, but we're not getting you as well.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.840
I'll try to speak a little louder.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.200
I can remember to speak louder.

02:25.420 --> 02:26.220
Maybe that'll work out.

02:26.460 --> 02:27.220
Yeah, that sounds fine.

02:27.400 --> 02:27.900
I like that.

02:28.920 --> 02:32.300
Okay, we just asked a question on how you got started writing in science fiction.

02:33.100 --> 02:33.540
Okay.

02:36.940 --> 02:40.800
What role does your background in anthropology have in your writing?

02:41.780 --> 02:45.060
Well, actually it does play a pretty big role in the writing because

02:47.220 --> 02:51.820
I find that anthropology and science fiction have a lot of things that are common for me.

02:52.700 --> 02:56.540
Archeology was my specialty and archaeology is the anthropology of the past.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.820
Science fiction for me is the anthropology of the future.

03:00.420 --> 03:02.000
They form sort of a long continuum.

03:03.740 --> 03:11.180
The thing I like about both science fiction and anthropology is that they allow you to see how other people do things

03:11.180 --> 03:14.560
and that other people's lives are not led the same way yours.

03:15.160 --> 03:20.420
There are other ways of coping that aren't necessarily the ones you've always known,

03:20.680 --> 03:24.320
that other people just think differently and get along perfectly well that way.

03:24.840 --> 03:30.240
I love the way that both anthropology and science fiction can take your preconceptions

03:30.240 --> 03:33.540
and turn them around 180 degrees and make you say,

03:33.680 --> 03:35.320
gee, I never thought of it like that before.

03:37.340 --> 03:42.460
Specifically, I like to use my anthropological background too

03:42.460 --> 03:46.120
when I'm setting up societies for the stories that I'm going to write.

03:46.740 --> 03:51.480
I do sort of an ethnography, which is a cultural study.

03:51.820 --> 03:54.540
Only I have to make up the details of the culture in general

03:54.540 --> 03:58.180
instead of just studying an anthropological culture.

03:58.780 --> 04:03.320
I do get a lot of details, bits and pieces of interesting societies

04:03.320 --> 04:07.640
which I recombine sometimes to create science fiction societies.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.280
It gives you a way of thinking.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.480
I think it's very useful when you're writing a science fiction story

04:14.480 --> 04:22.000
and looking for different ways, hoping that when you send your rocket ship out into the galaxy,

04:22.140 --> 04:27.860
it's not going to come to a planet where everyone acts like 1950s Earth.

04:29.780 --> 04:38.200
I really enjoy exploring differences in societies and things like that.

04:39.360 --> 04:44.400
And mythology is kind of an offshoot of science fiction.

04:45.880 --> 04:52.120
Mythology is an offshoot of anthropology that I find is very useful to science fiction too.

04:52.120 --> 05:02.380
I get a lot of story ideas from mythology and a lot of underlying strengths

05:02.380 --> 05:03.840
that are almost like fantasy.

05:04.080 --> 05:08.260
I like to weave them into the science fiction, which is what I most like to write.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.920
I think it gives a stronger appeal somewhere.

05:16.660 --> 05:21.300
Possibly being we all have sort of a common background of folktales and myths

05:21.300 --> 05:28.120
and by interweaving those in your stories, you sort of either reinforce or maybe update

05:29.340 --> 05:33.840
some of the old basic stories that our culture is based on.

05:34.180 --> 05:35.960
Right, I think very much so.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.400
I think there really are certain universalities in this too,

05:39.580 --> 05:43.480
which kind of strike everybody at a very deep and basic level.

05:43.980 --> 05:48.440
And if you could capture some of that same feeling in a story when you write it,

05:48.440 --> 05:54.500
maybe by employing elements consciously or unconsciously of, you know, out of mythology,

05:54.820 --> 05:59.400
I think that you could really have a very deep emotional impact on the reader,

05:59.980 --> 06:02.760
which I think is probably what every writer would like to do.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.680
Alrighty, let's see here.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.320
You already answered one of my other questions.

06:12.320 --> 06:20.280
So we'll go ahead and add on it here.

06:21.280 --> 06:25.420
Continuing on your use of folktales and stuff.

06:26.580 --> 06:32.680
All of your stories that I've read seem to have a happy ending of sorts.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.340
Is that sort of based on most folktales have happy endings?

06:36.980 --> 06:40.340
Is that because your stories have a basis in folktales,

06:40.340 --> 06:43.320
or that you're more or less basically an optimistic person?

06:43.760 --> 06:46.860
I think it's more than I'm basically an optimistic person.

06:47.420 --> 06:51.260
Actually, not every single one of my stories is based on folktales.

06:51.380 --> 06:55.580
A lot of them do have those elements in them, but some don't.

06:55.680 --> 07:00.940
It's just that I really, I hate to leave a story feeling totally depressed by it.

07:01.660 --> 07:04.440
And so I think I hate to write a story that's totally depressing.

07:04.560 --> 07:08.440
Frequently, I think the stories have sort of bittersweet endings,

07:08.440 --> 07:11.060
where people don't walk off hand-in-hand.

07:11.300 --> 07:16.860
The sunset there, usually dragging along a few suitcases full of problems too.

07:17.820 --> 07:23.680
But I think the way life is, it's unrealistic, usually, to write a totally happy ending.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.900
But I do like to have an optimistic ending.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.600
When I read things, I relate to them on a very personal level.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.360
I get very involved in the story.

07:34.360 --> 07:39.600
And if it's a story, the end result of which is to make me feel totally depressed

07:39.600 --> 07:44.360
and feel like, you know, why bother to live, I really don't like being left feeling that way.

07:44.500 --> 07:48.200
And I think I don't like feeling that way of when I write too.

07:49.960 --> 07:55.140
Yes, you seem to get very involved with the characters you create also.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.560
Is this because you fleshed them out so well when you're writing them?

07:58.860 --> 08:02.200
Or is it because your characters are sort of variations on yourself?

08:04.280 --> 08:07.220
Well, I think probably some of both.

08:07.540 --> 08:13.060
I think a lot of my favorite characters are bits and pieces of me.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.360
I don't know that any one of them is all me.

08:15.900 --> 08:19.200
I think all people have different aspects of their personality,

08:19.720 --> 08:23.980
which are come to the fore at different times, just in their day-to-day life.

08:24.620 --> 08:30.000
And I think when you're writing, you can't help but inject those personalities into characters.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.760
I really do like characters in stories.

08:33.420 --> 08:35.800
I like to read about characters who seem real.

08:36.760 --> 08:41.160
And so I like to try and make my own characters as real as possible when I write them.

08:42.300 --> 08:49.340
And I think, you know, by getting inside their heads, I invariably, you know, stick a few of my thoughts in there.

08:49.760 --> 08:54.340
I do have some characters who are based on other people I know and things like that too.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.340
But I do like to...

08:59.880 --> 09:04.640
Well, when I write about strange things and new ideas in different societies,

09:04.640 --> 09:09.720
I like to put people who are recognizable human, even if they're aliens, I suppose,

09:09.980 --> 09:14.360
but people that the reader can relate to into those situations

09:14.360 --> 09:19.680
and let the reader see how the human being reacts to the strange set of circumstances.

09:19.920 --> 09:23.300
It's not simply the strange set of circumstances which interests me,

09:23.300 --> 09:26.470
although that's, I think, why I write science fiction because I like...

09:26.880 --> 09:29.100
I don't like to write about the same old day-to-day thing.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.560
I like to explore new ground.

09:31.100 --> 09:38.540
But I like to do it with actual characters who come as close as possible to seeming like real people.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.600
I like to see what they do and give them circumstances.

09:43.060 --> 09:47.720
Science fiction is the only literature which allows you to speculate about the future.

09:47.720 --> 09:54.580
So it does open up a lot of vistas that can't be explored in what we call mainstream literature.

09:54.920 --> 09:55.240
Right.

09:57.420 --> 09:59.520
That's really what I like about science fiction.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.140
I read my first science fiction book when I was in ninth grade,

10:04.700 --> 10:07.900
and I just felt like, you know, boy, where has this been all my life?

10:08.380 --> 10:14.440
I just swept away by it and I felt like I really hardly wanted to read anything but science fiction after that.

10:14.440 --> 10:20.260
It was just so exciting to me to know that these new worlds opened up to me.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.040
Yeah. Okay, that's what we're getting to.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.320
Here's a story question.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.860
Dealing with the crystal ship and eyes of amber.

10:34.340 --> 10:37.780
In two of your stories, the crystal ship and the eyes of amber,

10:37.780 --> 10:43.890
you've explored the positive and negative aspects of a highly developed technological culture,

10:44.640 --> 10:47.120
making contact with a more primitive culture.

10:48.140 --> 10:57.140
Were you sort of extrapolating on contemporary aid or exploitation of world powers by lesser developed nations?

10:58.100 --> 11:07.520
Or is this more like when archaeologists or anthropologists uncover some of the more primitive tribes

11:07.520 --> 11:11.800
in Africa and Australia, some of the things that happened to them?

11:14.380 --> 11:18.740
Well, actually, part of that question slightly confuses me.

11:19.260 --> 11:28.580
Did you mean that more advanced cultures being, more technically advanced cultures being exploited by less advanced cultures, or vice versa?

11:28.580 --> 11:31.300
Vice versa. Let me back up.

11:31.720 --> 11:39.480
In a crystal ship, you have the extremely advanced culture on the planet with the...

11:41.900 --> 11:44.520
I can't remember the name of the race of the aliens.

11:45.340 --> 11:46.720
I don't either right now.

11:47.980 --> 11:49.840
Well, good. You don't feel as bad.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.760
But they come and they take over their planet.

11:55.760 --> 12:02.440
They start exploiting the aliens and then the aliens give them that drug, which sends them off into never, never land.

12:02.540 --> 12:06.060
And of course, their super advanced civilization collapses underneath them.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.880
But you take the other side of the coin and eyes of amber.

12:11.120 --> 12:21.180
You have the highly advanced civilization on earth helping the race on Titan through the use of the satellite that they landed on Titan.

12:22.560 --> 12:26.620
And the question, what was my question here? Let me find it again.

12:29.660 --> 12:36.080
Was that you have taken both the positive aspect and eyes of amber and the negative aspect in crystal ship.

12:36.560 --> 12:46.740
And was that sort of an extrapolation on either anthropological discoveries of ancient cultures,

12:47.660 --> 12:50.380
similar to those found in Australia or Africa,

12:51.200 --> 12:57.440
or the exploitation that the royal powers have done of lesser developed third and fourth world countries?

12:59.060 --> 13:03.280
Well, gee, some of both of those, I suppose,

13:03.560 --> 13:12.320
and just kind of my general awareness of history, you know, it's frequently at least recent history.

13:12.320 --> 13:19.920
It's frequently been the case that more technologically advanced cultures decide to spread out into territories

13:21.400 --> 13:27.420
in which the people are living at a lower level, excuse me, of culture and development.

13:28.500 --> 13:37.200
And they feel, you know, as I think the original justification in Utopia by Thomas Moore was that these people weren't making proper use of the land.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.940
Therefore, we should take it away from them and use it ourselves.

13:41.460 --> 13:49.860
I think that there's going to be some sort of chaotic reaction whenever two societies meet.

13:50.640 --> 13:55.300
You know, two, well, even two societies at a similar level frequently wind up fighting it out.

13:55.480 --> 14:00.900
But societies on different levels are going to collide and create a lot of culture shock.

14:01.360 --> 14:06.900
And it's going to change at least the less advanced society forever.

14:06.900 --> 14:11.000
Sometimes it has an effect on the more advanced society too.

14:11.660 --> 14:23.080
Frequently the more advanced society is so kind of sublime and it's arrogant that it really is friccally impervious to the values of the less developed society.

14:23.720 --> 14:31.520
You know, seeing itself as morally superior and bringing, you know, salvation to these poor dirty wretches.

14:31.520 --> 14:36.600
And, you know, I find that attitude rather intolerable.

14:36.980 --> 14:46.580
Although I think that, you know, by the same token, I think that there are things which the advanced society can offer to the less developed society,

14:46.780 --> 14:51.420
primarily things like better medical care and better farming methods and things like that frequently,

14:53.280 --> 14:58.780
which can be very beneficial to the people in the less developed society.

14:59.420 --> 15:06.600
But it's exploring the different factors and the different possibilities there and seeing what happens, you know,

15:06.640 --> 15:09.620
what is the potential for both good and evil in the situation.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.420
I think it's the drama of the situation that appeals to me.

15:12.960 --> 15:17.880
I tend, you know, I can't help but make certain moral judgments when I write, you know,

15:18.100 --> 15:25.620
when I set up a certain situation like the situation in the Crystal Ship where, you know,

15:25.620 --> 15:31.800
the arrogant society does, in fact, get its comeuppance, which rarely happens, usually in human history.

15:32.320 --> 15:41.460
I think I was sort of operating off of the idea of how European settlers had come and essentially rested all of the American,

15:42.660 --> 15:48.460
North and South American continents from the Indians, basically, and had not done much in return,

15:48.700 --> 15:55.180
but wiped them out and the Indians had been essentially, for the most part, defenseless in the long run against this.

15:55.180 --> 16:03.900
I've been thinking about how the Indians had introduced the Europeans to tobacco, which today, you know,

16:04.480 --> 16:11.380
I feel like it's a significant health problem, not on the same level as wiping out the entire society.

16:11.760 --> 16:20.340
But I think that, you know, my thought from this was what if they had introduced something to the Europeans,

16:20.340 --> 16:27.540
which was incredibly destructive to them. If they had brought smallpox to the Europeans instead of vice versa,

16:27.920 --> 16:33.000
what would have been the outcome of that situation? I think that was what I was playing around with at Crystal Ship.

16:33.900 --> 16:44.600
I guess an eyes-pamper was the idea that, you know, useful values or useful items even can be introduced into a culture

16:44.600 --> 16:48.700
by another culture and that the effect does not necessarily have to be bad.

16:49.200 --> 16:54.040
But then at the same time in that story, you also had the exploitive element, which you get,

16:54.200 --> 17:02.160
as you were saying, modern-day anthropologists marching in on some here for undisturbed Stone Age tribe

17:02.160 --> 17:07.400
and putting them all on national television and just totally disrupting their environment

17:07.400 --> 17:10.220
when they really have no business doing anything like that.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.260
Yes, very good answer.

17:16.260 --> 17:17.460
Do you want to drink a little more?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.820
I'm going to get it out all the through clearly.

17:22.280 --> 17:28.860
Oh yeah, we can whack those out. In fact, if you like to get a drink of water or something, we can pause for just a moment.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.420
Just in the process of doing that.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.420
Okay, you mentioned...

17:40.420 --> 17:44.560
I'm going to take part of this...

17:44.560 --> 17:51.000
I'm going to elaborate on your mention of Eyes of Amber and go on to a question on music in your stories.

17:51.860 --> 17:52.460
Okay.

17:56.880 --> 18:06.740
In Eyes of Amber, the protagonist is a musician, a songwriter, and it seems that music seems to play an important role in your writing.

18:08.400 --> 18:16.880
Yes, it really does, actually. I seem to relate to music on a kind of subliminal level.

18:16.880 --> 18:21.200
I guess it's something like...operaite something like mythology for me.

18:21.380 --> 18:28.920
When I hear a song, I frequently get down into the song and start wondering what's going on in the background of it.

18:29.720 --> 18:36.880
You know, the situation is set up in the song, leads me to think, well, who are the people involved in this and how did they get here

18:36.880 --> 18:44.340
and what is this talking about? Actually, I tend to relate to songs in a very personal way that they have a kind of reality about them.

18:44.340 --> 18:50.900
I frequently can't help thinking that the songwriter must have written that about his or her own experience,

18:51.040 --> 18:58.400
even though I know it's no more likely that they did and that someone writing fiction necessarily wrote a story about their own life.

18:59.000 --> 19:06.100
But I just enjoy music tremendously and it really stimulates creative juices for me.

19:06.160 --> 19:13.080
So I frequently do wind up being inspired to write certain things by listening to music.

19:13.080 --> 19:18.500
In fact, I, I, as a member of the, the title of that story is taken from the song by Buffy Saint Marie,

19:18.980 --> 19:28.540
which is about someone who knows a demon lover and sort of fit into the context of the story where the alien woman thinks of,

19:28.800 --> 19:36.640
of the space probe as a demon and she, she relates to it because it does respond to her,

19:36.640 --> 19:44.080
although she doesn't know what's the human beings on earth, she relates to it as another being and has this kind of fascination for it.

19:46.100 --> 19:52.820
It's just taking little elements like that and working them into some race. It's one of the pleasures of writing for me.

19:56.740 --> 19:58.160
Right. Okay.

19:59.160 --> 20:07.560
I pause after each one of your questions because the machine and the equipment that we have is designed for recording an incoming signal.

20:08.440 --> 20:14.780
And whenever I talk, it records it, but it's distorted and loud and all sorts of garbage in it.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.720
So we re-record the questions and then edit them in.

20:19.180 --> 20:26.660
So my questions will be the same questions as far as content goes, but they will probably be worded better than the ones I'm actually giving you.

20:26.760 --> 20:30.580
And they will, they will match your answers, which will make both of us sound really smart.

20:31.100 --> 20:31.700
Sounds great.

20:34.220 --> 20:35.220
Oh, okay.

20:35.220 --> 20:40.900
Oh, I do. There's so much technical, technical complexity involved in this.

20:41.320 --> 20:48.500
Usually when I do interviews, it usually wind up in the studio, you know, wind up doing them when I'm on the spot or something like that.

20:48.820 --> 20:52.700
It's very interesting to hear about everything that goes on at the end of the end, actually.

20:55.080 --> 21:04.840
Yeah. Yeah, we figured with the radio program, of course, a lot of it's left to your imagination and we have the distinct advantage of not having to represent any sort of visual image.

21:05.660 --> 21:10.960
And that we can just crank up and call up somebody and talk to them over the phone and record it.

21:11.040 --> 21:20.100
And then we process all the sounds in order to get the telephone noise off the line and edit it all together and put together a program.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.080
So it's got some good advantage and some distinct advantages to it.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.640
It cuts our travel budget way down.

21:25.640 --> 21:26.360
So great.

21:30.220 --> 21:38.880
Okay, this one is going to be a question about your future history, which it seems that you either seem to be developing or that you have developed.

21:39.280 --> 21:39.760
Okay.

21:40.880 --> 21:48.720
That being the outcast of Heaven's Belt, Legacy and Media Man and possibly some other stories which I haven't read, which might belong to that.

21:48.980 --> 21:50.460
No, actually, I think there are only two.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.200
Okay, but okay, here's the question.

21:55.900 --> 22:04.720
You've tackled one of the more difficult types of science fiction, that being future history, as in the outcast of Heaven's Belt, Legacy and Media Man.

22:05.580 --> 22:10.040
All the stories having a common background. How did your future history get started?

22:10.040 --> 22:16.740
Well, actually, the future history kind of belongs to my assessment, to the truth.

22:17.340 --> 22:26.780
The idea of the situation in the outcast of Heaven's Belt, which was the original thing that I wrote in what turned out to be that future history,

22:27.020 --> 22:34.440
was the idea of a solar system, another system where there was no Earth like planet,

22:34.440 --> 22:44.720
but an appellate asteroid belt and some gas giant planets where if you had a high enough technology level, then you could survive there in a very luxurious way.

22:44.860 --> 22:50.520
But if you ever lost the technological level, you had no Earth like planet to retreat to,

22:50.760 --> 22:54.480
where you didn't have to manufacture your own air and water and things like that,

22:54.900 --> 23:01.900
and that, you know, below a certain level of technological development you were doomed.

23:02.480 --> 23:09.000
This basic idea had been one that Werner had had, and he was not actively writing at that time.

23:09.220 --> 23:19.040
He teaches at San Diego State University, and he was in Wisconsin, you know, the process of getting his tenure and things like that.

23:19.140 --> 23:26.580
So I was the writer and the family, and he was kind of sublimating, I guess, by helping me work with my writing.

23:26.580 --> 23:30.940
And I was at a loss for an idea at one point, and he said,

23:31.020 --> 23:33.540
well, I have this idea, if you want to write a story about it.

23:33.720 --> 23:43.940
So I wound up writing out castles of Heaven's Belt about this society, and then I got the idea for the story Media Man later on.

23:44.400 --> 23:48.940
Well, I was still in the process of doing the novel, actually, because I started making it as a novella,

23:48.940 --> 23:53.600
and then I decided that it was not sufficiently fleshed out, and I had to make it into a novel.

23:53.600 --> 24:01.480
But in the midst of all that, I got the idea for Media Man, which was from a very ordinary, everyday idea,

24:02.240 --> 24:10.520
which I wanted to take, the sort of the hero and the villain trapped in the middle of nowhere, and how do you get out of it alive?

24:11.120 --> 24:15.800
I decided I wanted to take that particular situation and make a science fiction story around it.

24:15.800 --> 24:23.800
And when I started thinking about it, I realized that the Media Man, the sort of combination of Ad Man and News Man,

24:24.220 --> 24:32.480
which populates the demarchy, which is one of the societies in Heaven's Belt, that being the asteroid belt in the story,

24:33.300 --> 24:37.160
that the Media Man was the perfect sort of person to put into this situation.

24:37.800 --> 24:42.340
And it was one of the few stories where just about everything in the story kind of fell into place at once for me.

24:42.340 --> 24:47.100
I realized that it fit just perfectly into the same future history as the novel did.

24:48.320 --> 24:54.120
And so far, I have been doing a lot of different histories, actually.

24:54.280 --> 24:57.060
I take a lot of different stories, which take place in different futures,

24:57.640 --> 25:02.660
and I've just been having fun kind of playing around with that and having a lot of different societies.

25:02.940 --> 25:09.160
But I look upon each one of those possible futures as developing into a separate future history,

25:09.160 --> 25:15.080
because if I ever find another story that fits into that mode, like with Tim Soldier,

25:15.280 --> 25:20.160
if I ever find another story that seems to fit perfectly with a group of women spacers,

25:20.860 --> 25:23.660
I will write another story in that future history.

25:25.540 --> 25:31.900
And so far, the Heaven Belt future history is the only one that has actually produced more than one story.

25:31.900 --> 25:40.940
The only legacy is actually the expansion of the Media Man, which combines Media Man and the sequel to Media Man,

25:41.200 --> 25:45.580
both of which are prequels to the novel Outcast of Heaven Belt, which gets very complicated.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.160
I do look forward to writing more things in that future history.

25:49.280 --> 25:57.320
I'd like to write more about the planet Morningside, which is also involved in the story in Outcast of Heaven Belt,

25:57.320 --> 26:02.200
because I had a lot more background about that planet, which I didn't really get to use in the novel,

26:02.420 --> 26:04.620
and I'd like to write more about that sometime too.

26:11.340 --> 26:14.980
Okay. Very good.

26:15.900 --> 26:19.080
I have only scanned part of Outcast of Heaven Belt.

26:19.420 --> 26:21.920
Is Morningside the planet that the Starship comes from?

26:22.120 --> 26:22.520
Right.

26:24.320 --> 26:27.220
Okay. Oh, yeah, by the way, I did get a Snow Queen.

26:27.480 --> 26:27.860
Oh, you did?

26:27.960 --> 26:30.380
And yeah, we found it in Dallas and they shipped it to us.

26:30.600 --> 26:34.280
So I have read about half of it, reading rapidly along,

26:35.480 --> 26:39.720
along with reading everything else at the same time, and trying not to get them confused.

26:41.200 --> 26:49.120
But I have a gigantic question about the Snow Queen, which you can feel free to cut short or talk about for the next day,

26:49.120 --> 26:52.940
or whatever.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.860
Here's an interjection question.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.100
I don't think I've asked you this one.

26:58.140 --> 27:00.660
I haven't asked you a question about how you construct aliens, have I?

27:01.100 --> 27:01.760
No, I do what?

27:02.040 --> 27:03.040
Construct your aliens.

27:03.220 --> 27:03.640
Oh, no.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.100
Okay, good. That's a good question.

27:05.220 --> 27:05.540
Here we go.

27:06.580 --> 27:06.960
Okay.

27:07.960 --> 27:14.820
I'll probably move this back up into the part where we were talking about the Crystal Ship and Eyes of Amber.

27:16.380 --> 27:17.080
Okay.

27:17.660 --> 27:25.180
But since you do have a rather good background in anthropology, how do you go about constructing your aliens?

27:26.600 --> 27:29.760
Oh, that's an interesting question, actually.

27:30.420 --> 27:35.580
I don't think I have any particular method for constructing aliens.

27:35.580 --> 27:42.080
They frequently kind of arise out of other givens in the situation, out of the environment.

27:42.640 --> 27:58.620
In Eyes of Amber, the aliens, although they seemed superficially humanoid, were actually constructed for an entirely different nitrogen breathing situation on a world,

27:58.620 --> 28:05.340
in one of the moons of Saturn, a world which was extremely cold.

28:07.380 --> 28:13.400
They were tri-supiens, which meant that they spent part of the time of the sky, part of the land, part of the water.

28:15.340 --> 28:19.260
The creatures in Crystal Ship were sort of marsupial-like.

28:20.860 --> 28:26.120
The creatures in my story, to Belle, the cat, thrived on radiation.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.040
They just lived on pure radiation.

28:28.680 --> 28:39.460
They lived in essentially a hot, incredibly, radioactively hot swamp on a planet, hidden away in a cave.

28:39.460 --> 28:42.900
There's actually no real pattern to any of them.

28:43.160 --> 28:51.160
The creatures living in the cave came out of the idea of there being essentially natural nuclear reactors forming on the Earth.

28:51.380 --> 28:56.960
There was an article somewhere about how there seemed to be the fossil remains of one somewhere in Africa.

28:57.200 --> 29:07.920
I think it seemed that at some point a concentration of ore had gotten so radioactively hot that it eventually started after a nuclear reaction.

29:07.920 --> 29:12.880
Not a bomb, but just a kind of a roiling, boiling situation.

29:13.740 --> 29:16.720
And so I had these creatures that had come from a whole planet that was like that,

29:16.800 --> 29:22.020
and had been shipwrecked essentially on this planet, which would be normal to human beings.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.960
And they had managed to find this spot and take refuge in it.

29:28.040 --> 29:32.260
It came out of trying to think of what sort of creatures would live in that environment.

29:32.960 --> 29:40.560
I suppose I must, in general, start with the environment and then try to think about what sort of adaptations would be necessary to it.

29:41.920 --> 29:49.520
I don't know. The aliens are one of those things that just sort of spring out of the unconscious, I guess.

29:49.700 --> 29:56.640
I don't really have a pattern for creating them, except that I start with certain givens of the culture.

29:56.640 --> 30:04.840
What are the problems with creating aliens is that if you make them too alien, then the reader can't understand them or relate to them,

30:04.860 --> 30:07.120
and they just seem to be essentially nonsensical.

30:07.840 --> 30:16.120
It's very difficult to try to convey a feeling of alienness and yet something that a human being can still relate to and not simply say,

30:17.140 --> 30:20.540
what is this junk? I don't understand this. Stop reading books.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.420
A lot of science fiction writers have talked about that.

30:23.420 --> 30:28.940
There are frequently accusations about, well, the aliens are not really alien enough,

30:29.560 --> 30:34.060
but then you come down to the old bottom line that if they are alien enough,

30:34.440 --> 30:40.640
even if one human being can imagine something that alien, someone else may not be able to understand it.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.900
So you always caught the mind when you're writing about aliens.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.980
Yes, you seem to end to bell the cat.

30:47.700 --> 30:53.180
You have created one of the, if you'll pardon a pun or whatever,

30:53.760 --> 30:57.840
you seem to have created one of the most alien aliens I've read about.

30:59.200 --> 31:03.020
How did you come up with the idea that the being, as I understand it,

31:03.480 --> 31:09.780
the mind is or the intelligence of the creature is down hidden away in the cave,

31:09.780 --> 31:18.600
and it either creates or controls the, it's mobile parts, the little creatures.

31:19.040 --> 31:19.200
Right.

31:20.480 --> 31:25.260
But it's thought processes were amazing. What did you go through to come up with that?

31:27.180 --> 31:30.280
This reminds me of a story about Robert Browning,

31:30.680 --> 31:34.700
when a woman asked him one time what one of his poems meant,

31:35.220 --> 31:38.840
and he said, matter, when I wrote that, only God and I knew what it meant,

31:38.840 --> 31:40.300
and now only God knows.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.340
I can't actually remember how I came up with that idea.

31:44.700 --> 31:47.580
It's terrible. I don't know whether it's in my notes anywhere or not.

31:48.380 --> 31:53.940
I think it must have grown, kind of grown out of the idea of specialization in animals,

31:54.060 --> 31:58.800
where, you know, a human being is, is, biologically speaking,

31:58.980 --> 32:01.840
a very unspecialized creature because it has fingernails,

32:02.420 --> 32:06.640
which are the most primitive form of things as opposed to a claw or a hoof,

32:06.640 --> 32:11.940
which are, which are adaptations, you know, specializations of nails.

32:12.600 --> 32:16.000
And, you know, there are various other things about the human body,

32:16.100 --> 32:19.600
which are, quote, primitive, biologically.

32:20.200 --> 32:25.260
And I guess I may have been thinking about specialization developing to an extreme,

32:25.520 --> 32:30.860
where actual different parts of the body became separate entities,

32:31.060 --> 32:34.140
and they were all controlled by the mind, which stayed in one spot.

32:34.140 --> 32:38.240
Some of the specialized parts were particularly strong,

32:38.460 --> 32:40.940
and some were particularly agile, things like that.

32:41.160 --> 32:46.900
And they could be sent out, kind of, far-ranging and controlled telepathically by the brain,

32:47.020 --> 32:48.920
which just stayed at home in safety.

32:50.080 --> 32:56.640
And there were essentially two levels of organism which made up one creature,

32:56.640 --> 33:04.140
and the specialized creatures that the brain controlled

33:04.140 --> 33:07.840
had no particular brain of their own, et cetera, a rudimentary receiver,

33:08.380 --> 33:14.780
so that it could send them into commands and it could receive back from various impressions of what they were doing.

33:15.540 --> 33:20.240
I wound up, the way they communicate became sort of like writing poetry.

33:21.060 --> 33:25.720
I used to like direct poetry, and this came as close to million as I had for a long time,

33:25.720 --> 33:30.140
and that while the brain creatures were communicating with each other,

33:30.260 --> 33:33.520
with the other brains and discussing their plight,

33:34.000 --> 33:38.920
they were at the same time receiving input and sending directions to all their mobiles,

33:39.120 --> 33:44.100
their little specialized parts that were moving around in the radioactive muck.

33:45.120 --> 33:52.860
And so you would get their basic commentary and then all the levels below that interaction.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.340
And I really enjoyed writing about that.

33:58.280 --> 34:02.320
I thought it was quite exciting when I was doing it,

34:02.320 --> 34:07.380
but the trouble is that I think I only found one person who actually understood,

34:08.080 --> 34:12.280
without having it explained to them what was going on in that story,

34:12.520 --> 34:18.160
and I wasn't able to understand, and I felt like that was the case where my aliens had got to aliens for their own good.

34:18.160 --> 34:24.600
I was sort of frustrated and worried, but I'm not sure I did it actually.

34:24.860 --> 34:28.100
It was a fascinating experience for me.

34:29.340 --> 34:32.520
Yeah, well, you found two. Darryl, did you understand it?

34:33.200 --> 34:34.520
Three. Okay, you found three.

34:37.620 --> 34:43.020
Okay, now this is the question on Snow Queen.

34:44.120 --> 34:49.880
Okay, and feel free to elaborate or whatever you want to do without giving away the plot.

34:50.580 --> 34:53.460
Well, to give away the plot would take me four or five hours.

34:53.720 --> 34:58.780
Oh, okay, good. We don't have that much time, especially because I haven't finished it yet and I want to find out how it ends.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.700
I'll try not to, what the ending is for this.

35:01.700 --> 35:12.760
But okay, you've undertaken another difficult writing task, that being world building in your novel, The Snow Queen.

35:13.780 --> 35:17.760
It's a wonderful work of science fantasy. Would you call it science fantasy?

35:18.580 --> 35:24.860
I suppose so, actually. It is, you know, in its heart, it's a science fiction story,

35:24.980 --> 35:29.440
but it does have heavy mythological elements, which I think give it a fantasy like quality.

35:29.440 --> 35:34.480
And I wasn't fighting that at all. I was striving for a sort of fiction.

35:35.080 --> 35:39.540
Yeah, I think you got it. Okay, here's the rest of the question. Let me back up here.

35:40.000 --> 35:46.940
It has a wonderful work. It's a wonderful work of science fantasy with a very involved plot and a very exciting narrative.

35:47.480 --> 35:53.080
This must have taken a tremendous amount of background material to develop this novel.

35:55.120 --> 36:10.240
Well, yes, probably. Oh gosh, that book was quite an incredible thing for me to write that book because I wound up being about, it was over 600 pages of manuscript.

36:10.680 --> 36:19.060
It's almost 200,000 words long. And when I started writing it, I had never written a complete novel all at once.

36:19.600 --> 36:25.940
I was with Ascot of Heaven Delta, I had written the novella, and then I had increased its size to have a novel.

36:27.340 --> 36:36.360
I was feeling kind of daunted about the very idea of writing a normal, what I thought would be a normal length novel of about 200 pages.

36:37.800 --> 36:46.180
But I finally did sit down and start to write it. And the more I wrote, the more I realized that it was not going to stop at 200 pages.

36:46.180 --> 36:51.000
I think I had gotten through 100 pages and realized that I had barely gotten into the plot at all.

36:51.440 --> 36:56.600
My writing, and from then on I could only just go on and write and write and write and see where it led me.

36:57.060 --> 37:03.740
It got more and more complicated as it went along until I really despaired at times that I would ever be able to finish the thing.

37:04.380 --> 37:10.500
It was a great comfort to me when I finally sat down and figured out how everything had to fit together. It gets me into the book.

37:12.640 --> 37:19.200
I did a fair amount of background work beforehand, but actually I wound up doing a great deal of the work.

37:19.440 --> 37:28.840
I think during the process of writing the book, I conceived of the idea of the Wicked City of Carbuckle,

37:29.040 --> 37:33.380
which gets its name because it's either a jewel or a fester, depending on your point of view.

37:34.300 --> 37:42.300
I wanted it to be a place where all kinds of cultures and all kinds of worlds came together and mixed and mingled.

37:43.280 --> 37:50.160
In trying to make a portrait of the city, I needed a lot of different characters with a lot of different backgrounds behind them.

37:54.480 --> 37:59.680
Whenever I needed a new character, I would write one into the story and then I couldn't have to figure out where they came from.

38:01.520 --> 38:05.360
Frequently, I don't lay everything out before I actually start to write a book.

38:05.420 --> 38:14.780
I have a basic structure, which I think is being sort of like a trellis, and then the story is a line that grows up through it and fills it in and flushes it out and things.

38:16.180 --> 38:26.780
I think because I didn't have any idea of how big the Snow Queen was going to be, it got even more complex in the process than most of the things.

38:26.780 --> 38:34.020
I have a clearer idea ahead of time of what they're going to be about, but it was just so massive, it was impossible to think about everything ahead of time.

38:34.460 --> 38:40.840
It was mostly the scientific research I think that I did ahead of time, reading up on black holes and things like that.

38:41.400 --> 38:48.960
I regret that black holes and clones became such kind of stereotypes during the time which I was writing a book.

38:48.960 --> 38:56.540
They were not quite such archetypal sci-fi clichés when I started writing the book as they are now.

38:56.900 --> 39:06.800
At least, since I hope the book will appeal to a wide audience, at least people who don't even regularly read science fiction will know what I'm talking about.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.500
I've talked about black holes and clones at this point.

39:10.250 --> 39:28.660
I did do a fair amount of technical reading or semi-technical reading on the nature of black holes and using them as means of travel in order to set up the basic science fictional premises of the book.

39:29.900 --> 39:37.180
I happened to read Robert Graves' book, The White Goddess, just before I started writing The Snow Queen.

39:37.820 --> 39:48.040
I found that influenced me heavily and that I got a lot of the mythical fantasy-type elements out of that and kind of wove them into the texture of the book.

39:49.860 --> 40:02.360
I tried to create societies which would kind of fit in with the most technical and non-technical societies which would sit comfortably with the underlying themes and premises of the book.

40:03.620 --> 40:08.540
And from there, things just grow like topsy, I guess.

40:09.760 --> 40:20.340
One of the characters comes from a very advanced society, the most technologically dominant society in the book.

40:20.740 --> 40:29.000
He started out as a walk-on character, his name is Gondolino, and he came along with one of the major characters in the book in the scene.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.380
And he just started acting up.

40:30.380 --> 40:35.880
And out of his personality, I kind of saw a whole cultural stereotype growing.

40:36.860 --> 40:41.700
And I realized, actually, part of where he came from was that I had been reading a lot of books about...

40:41.700 --> 40:49.560
I've been reading some fiction books about Romans and Britain because I've always been fascinated by Romans and Britain as part of the archaeology thing, I guess.

40:49.560 --> 41:07.100
And just the kind of fascination with the sort of science fiction or reversal where the highly cultured people are the people who too often wind up in certain sensory fantasies,

41:07.360 --> 41:12.140
the kind of dark and swarthy people, and they're usually spulking around in the bushes,

41:12.140 --> 41:21.340
but they were the people who were slob and sophisticated and non-top, and the people with red hair and freckles and green eyes were running around like howling barbarians in the brush.

41:21.860 --> 41:23.480
I thought that was a delightful twist.

41:24.920 --> 41:32.360
But thinking about this and about cultural arrogance and how the Romans sort of resembled a Victorian English in that way,

41:33.680 --> 41:37.480
I just got into a mindset to write about that sort of character, I think.

41:37.480 --> 41:47.580
And so, without even realizing it, this particular character just began taking on all these aspects, and out of him I realized what his whole culture must be like,

41:47.580 --> 41:53.480
and it became one of the important societies in the book.

41:55.360 --> 41:57.800
And just odd little things happened like that.

41:57.940 --> 42:00.120
This whole book kind of grew up in a strange way.

42:00.540 --> 42:06.080
It was quite an indescribable thing, and if I had known ahead of time what I was getting into, I would never have started it.

42:06.080 --> 42:09.660
But probably just as well that we can't see the future, I think.

42:11.080 --> 42:11.600
Yeah.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.760
Correct me if I'm wrong.

42:15.500 --> 42:25.940
I believe I read somewhere that you had some, is some part of that novel based upon the hands of Christian Anderson, Story Snow Queen?

42:26.460 --> 42:27.400
Oh, yes it is.

42:27.540 --> 42:31.220
As a matter of fact, that was my original inspiration for the book.

42:32.740 --> 42:39.500
There's a cartoon and animated movie of the Snow Queen, which they occasionally show on television.

42:40.120 --> 42:45.880
If you can wait through 15 minutes of art, link-letter, talking to children at the beginning of it, it's really quite well done.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.900
I was interested in it.

42:49.060 --> 42:53.000
You know, I had first seen that movie when I was in about eighth grade, and then, oh, this is silly.

42:53.580 --> 43:00.240
But when I saw it again back during the 70s sometime, I realized what an interesting fairy tale it is.

43:01.860 --> 43:07.140
The thing about most fairy tales is that they are frequently degenerate mythology.

43:07.600 --> 43:16.520
And if you know any particular amount about Near Eastern and European mythology, you see a lot of symbolic archetypes.

43:16.680 --> 43:29.200
You see ravens and stags, and wicked stepmother and the sweet young innocence and things like that, which, you know, they all actually have their archetypes back.

43:29.200 --> 43:49.800
In European and Near Eastern mythology, and that, well, just as an aside, that was why the Robert Graves book on the White Goddess and on all that mythology in Europe and the Near East fit in so perfectly with this particular story.

43:49.800 --> 43:59.120
And Hans Christian Anderson had written down what was essentially one of these old tales, which were kind of twisted up mythology.

43:59.860 --> 44:05.720
And the thing that interested me, especially about this particular tale, was that there was no prince in it,

44:06.580 --> 44:16.460
and usually prince who gets to do all the fun and exciting things like fighting the dragons and things like that, and waking up to the sleeping maiden and the women in the story,

44:16.600 --> 44:20.840
usually either the wicked old witch or some helpless, simple, and creature.

44:21.880 --> 44:25.880
And, you know, I get sort of bored with that kind of thing, but I was very interested.

44:25.880 --> 44:35.400
This book was quite a twist because, or this fairy tale was quite a twist because all the main roles in it were played by women.

44:36.060 --> 44:46.020
The basic idea of the story is that there's a little girl and a little boy who are friends and the little boy is still on the way by the Snow Queen, who is kind of an elemental goddess of winter.

44:46.020 --> 44:57.000
And most of the story concerns the little girl's travels as she's searching for him and all the people she meets are virtually all female,

44:57.260 --> 45:00.140
and the people in positions of power in the story are women.

45:00.660 --> 45:10.820
And I thought that was quite interesting and unique, and I was in the mood to do a story in which women played major roles in the book.

45:11.500 --> 45:15.140
And so I thought that was a good jumping off point for it.

45:15.620 --> 45:21.360
And so, you know, from there everything else just started growing basically.

45:21.780 --> 45:26.300
I read Robert Graves' book and I said, boy, this gives me a lot more fuel for the fire.

45:27.720 --> 45:30.060
And I just started writing at that point.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.600
I didn't want to write a fantasy, though.

45:32.660 --> 45:36.760
I didn't want to just make it a retelling of the fairy tale, basically.

45:36.760 --> 45:43.660
I really wanted it to be a whole new story and I wanted it to be science fiction as well, because that's just the way my brain works.

45:43.840 --> 45:47.080
I guess I have written a couple of fantasy stories recently, you know.

45:47.420 --> 45:57.120
I've always enjoyed reading fantasy as well as science fiction, but so far the majority of my work has been at least technically science fiction.

45:58.920 --> 46:00.420
You answered my next question.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.180
Did you have any fantasy stories on the back?

46:03.280 --> 46:03.620
No, no, no.

46:03.680 --> 46:04.740
Okay, you already took care of that one.

46:04.740 --> 46:11.160
All right, we've pretty well rolled through.
