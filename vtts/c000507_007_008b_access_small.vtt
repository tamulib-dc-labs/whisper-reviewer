You mentioned a little bit about this already, but if you could summarize it for me, your

00:05.760 --> 00:09.060
future plans for writing, what you might have planned for the future for any science fiction,

00:09.180 --> 00:09.480
or anything?

00:10.460 --> 00:17.800
Well, my future plans boil down to kind of a step at a time, right?

00:19.660 --> 00:26.980
I find it hard to spend the emotional energy it takes to write while I'm involved with

00:26.980 --> 00:33.440
the chairmanship of the department of anthropology, and I have to in effect serve out my term,

00:33.560 --> 00:35.220
and that's sort of the way I think of it.

00:35.700 --> 00:43.180
As chairman, before I can get back to my writing, and I don't know how specific I can be, the

00:43.180 --> 00:47.400
only thing I can tell you is that I don't think my writing is over.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.280
In fact, I'm sure that it's not over.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.860
The only way you can stop me writing is to kill me.

00:52.900 --> 00:58.960
But what specific form it will take, I can't tell you, some of it will certainly be science fiction,

00:59.820 --> 01:06.960
and I'd like to think I can overcome my own law here, and I would like to think that my

01:06.960 --> 01:12.720
best work is still ahead of me, but everybody always says that, and it doesn't mean that

01:12.720 --> 01:16.320
your best work is necessarily ahead of you, but I'm going to give it a shot.

01:17.200 --> 01:17.980
I get it, okay.

01:18.880 --> 01:19.940
That's fine, Chad.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.000
Okay, is that all you need?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.100
Well, yeah, we could talk for hours, and that's fine.

01:23.100 --> 01:23.640
Okay, okay.

01:23.760 --> 01:24.440
That'll be great.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.120
Okay, I would, I do need a little...
