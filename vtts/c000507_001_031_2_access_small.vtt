00:01.420 --> 00:06.920
Since you have it in the Bay Area, you may actually be able to understand what, when

00:06.920 --> 00:14.340
I tell you where the novels here come, then Zurich is actually the Bay Area in some sense

00:14.340 --> 00:20.140
anyway, not literally, but the fact is that I live in the hills of Oakland in East Bay

00:21.140 --> 00:24.920
and there's a drive along the ridge of the hills.

00:26.100 --> 00:35.820
I was up there one evening just at dusk when the light is such that the Bay itself, which

00:35.820 --> 00:41.920
you can look down on, you'll see San Francisco and Marin County across the Bay and San Jose

00:41.920 --> 00:47.960
to the south and Berkeley and Oakland in front of you and a lot of water in the middle,

00:48.580 --> 00:54.980
but at a particular time in the evening that water simply turned black and I was up there

00:54.980 --> 00:58.980
looking at that and I thought, my God, you can't even tell at the bay it looks like a

00:58.980 --> 01:04.460
gigantic hole in the ground and immediately I thought, what would a city be like to rebuild

01:04.460 --> 01:11.820
a gigantic shaft into the earth like that? What effect might that kind of physical environment

01:12.760 --> 01:18.960
have on the psychology of the people who lived in that city, which is how the whole symbolism,

01:19.860 --> 01:23.880
the religious symbolism of the city of Zurich came to me?

01:26.700 --> 01:29.960
Yeah, good. I was glad to get that. Every once in a while, we'll have an author tell us where he

01:29.960 --> 01:36.160
gets the idea for a story. For instance, Rogers Alasney told us how he got the idea for road marks,

01:36.240 --> 01:41.300
which just made the whole show. It was beautifully fascinating story. It's interesting,

01:41.300 --> 01:46.720
authors get their ideas. Yeah, usually you don't exactly know where you got your ideas,

01:46.800 --> 01:53.880
but that was a very clear vision that came to me. I hate to use that word because it seems to

01:53.880 --> 01:57.820
mean more than it does, but it was just a particular way that I saw something that it made me think.

01:59.940 --> 02:04.940
Okay, let me just pick out one short story. It's my favorite, the dance of the changer and the three.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.900
Did you have an impetus or an origin behind that one?

02:09.580 --> 02:12.700
Yes, I did. As a matter of fact, that's another one I can pinpoint.

02:14.140 --> 02:18.700
I had been reading of all people, Rogers Alasney. We've seen him be mentioning him a lot here.

02:20.980 --> 02:27.260
And Roger at that time, this has been the late 60s, was working a lot with mythology in his

02:27.260 --> 02:34.940
science fiction. And I got interested in his work. I love his work. And I was always interested in

02:34.940 --> 02:46.200
mythology itself. And it occurred to me that mythology tells a whole lot about the fears,

02:46.480 --> 02:55.180
the hopes, the beliefs of humanity. And that indeed, if any alien creature that ever came to

02:55.180 --> 03:01.260
this planet and wanted to find out something about what makes humanity tick, they could do far worse

03:01.260 --> 03:07.000
than to study some of our myths. And I suddenly just, there was a little skeptic that goes on

03:07.000 --> 03:12.480
in my head and I turned that around and said, well, I like to just think and write about aliens.

03:13.320 --> 03:18.040
And it's very difficult to write about an alien being inside because I personally believe that

03:18.040 --> 03:25.160
aliens are inexplicable to us. We're never going to understand this totally. So I thought possibly

03:25.160 --> 03:32.060
a good way of dealing with the portrayal of an alien or an entire alien race would be to do it

03:33.380 --> 03:38.600
circuitously by telling an alien myth. And that is exactly what the dance of the changer in the

03:38.600 --> 03:43.100
three years, of course, is an alien myth. And the myth itself is supposed to tell you a lot about

03:43.100 --> 03:50.180
the psychology of the race. Yeah, when I read that, I got the impression that one of the points of

03:50.180 --> 03:56.340
was that aliens are likely to be totally incomprehensible to us, that there can be no real communication.

03:57.660 --> 04:02.940
Yeah, that was the basic point. Yeah, I've been trying to make that point in number of my stories.

04:03.060 --> 04:08.120
There's another one that I wrote earlier called Topkran, which makes much the same point, but not

04:08.600 --> 04:15.380
quite as dramatically as that does. Okay, could you tell me this about that dance or dance of the

04:15.380 --> 04:22.200
changer in the three? Was there a relationship between the dance and the myth you told in the way

04:22.200 --> 04:32.160
that they wiped out the human beings? Was there a relationship between them? I don't know, frankly.

04:33.240 --> 04:41.060
And I don't want to know. The method that I used in writing that was, since I believed the

04:41.710 --> 04:49.800
alien would be totally ununderstandable to us, every time the story that I was telling

04:50.900 --> 04:55.880
became too comprehensible, I would write something that made no sense whatever.

04:57.140 --> 05:04.300
So the myth itself, of course, is kind of a self-canceling myth. If you actually analyze it,

05:04.300 --> 05:11.960
there's a certain circularity to it. It has a dramatic coherence.

05:13.900 --> 05:23.000
But it's not a story that we would ever tell about ourselves that would resonate with the human

05:23.000 --> 05:29.440
psyche. And I wanted to end the story with something totally inexplicable happening, just to

05:31.020 --> 05:36.960
to underscore and emphasize the fact that these creatures were aliens. And I wanted it to be

05:36.960 --> 05:42.080
something that none of us is going to understand. And that meant inevitably that I had to be sure I

05:42.080 --> 05:49.080
didn't understand it either. Okay, good. Could I just end this line of question you were asking?

05:49.260 --> 05:54.200
You then, do I take it that you, this is a totally personal question. It doesn't involve your work

05:54.200 --> 05:59.600
so much. But I take it then that you think that we may run across the alien species someday in the

05:59.600 --> 06:07.800
galaxy? I think that we may. I have no idea if we ever will. There are so many things against it.

06:10.160 --> 06:14.620
You have no idea if there are actually any creatures out there. It seems just mathematically that

06:14.620 --> 06:20.840
there must be. But they're going to be so far away that I have no idea if we will actually ever be

06:20.840 --> 06:25.380
able to travel between stars. Despite the fact that science fiction is always writing about

06:25.380 --> 06:30.840
traveling between stars, it may well prove to be an impossibility. So I have no idea if we're ever

06:30.840 --> 06:38.680
going to manage to meet them. We might get in touch with them through radio or through light

06:38.680 --> 06:43.000
beams or something like that. But even then, I mean, you know, messages traveling at the speed of

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
light are going to take hundreds and thousands of years to pass back and forth between stars.

06:48.460 --> 06:53.020
So I don't know. On the other hand, possibly what we know about the laws of physics is not complete.

06:53.540 --> 07:00.380
And the speed of light is not an unattainable velocity. And possibly

07:01.100 --> 07:05.960
trans light speeds will be possible for us so that we can get out there. And if we ever do get out

07:05.960 --> 07:12.500
there, or if indeed other creatures have discovered how to travel faster than speed of light, they may

07:12.500 --> 07:20.420
come here. But with our present knowledge, it seems very unlikely. We talked to Dr. Robert

07:20.420 --> 07:24.940
Forward not too long ago, and he was telling us about the latest and possible stellar drive.

07:25.560 --> 07:30.300
It has something to do with twister space, where he seems to have worked at that where it could be

07:30.300 --> 07:37.820
theoretically possible. Well, it may very well be. Yeah, I saw a lecture here in fact a few years ago.

07:37.820 --> 07:45.060
But some of his ideas about that. And they do seem possible. But again, there's still theories at

07:45.060 --> 07:53.200
this point, and they're nowhere near being hardware. That's right. Listen, I would, I think your

07:53.200 --> 07:59.820
perspective on science fiction is a valuable one. I can't, I mean, the reading you must do in the

07:59.820 --> 08:05.020
field has to be immense to anthologize like you do. And I've, you've read science fiction, I guess,

08:05.020 --> 08:09.980
steadily for over 25 years. I just want to ask you a few general questions about the field from

08:09.980 --> 08:15.260
your perspective. In the time you've been in it, since you've been a serious fan of the present,

08:16.300 --> 08:20.900
have you seen any big changes in the field? And so what would they be?

08:21.760 --> 08:25.840
There have been enormous changes in the field since then. When I started reading it, it was a

08:26.820 --> 08:32.980
genre of adventure fiction. Almost exclusively, there are very, very few

08:34.180 --> 08:41.120
stories that would be called serious fiction in general. There are a few, but not too many.

08:41.260 --> 08:47.440
There were the exceptions. Whereas today, although we still have our usual complement of adventure

08:47.440 --> 08:51.440
stories, those are, you know, they're fun stories. There's nothing wrong with them. But we have a much

08:51.440 --> 08:59.280
wider variety of things that we can write. We can, for instance, a novel like Sirk, which is,

09:00.040 --> 09:06.620
oh, it's an adventure story, but it's also a story about religion, about philosophy, and so

09:06.620 --> 09:11.120
forth. Something like that simply could not have been published in science fiction, but when I was

09:11.120 --> 09:16.320
first reading it, there wouldn't have been anybody who would have taken a chance on publishing it.

09:16.400 --> 09:20.140
And I doubt very many people would have enjoyed it, because they certainly, they simply weren't

09:20.140 --> 09:26.140
ready for it. I'm sure I wouldn't have liked that story. Well, maybe I would have. But I would

09:26.140 --> 09:31.220
have had a good deal of trouble understanding that story when I was 11 or 12 years old,

09:31.980 --> 09:36.940
first reading science fiction. There's been a great deal of improvement in the variety of

09:36.940 --> 09:43.020
things we can do in science fiction. And in the literary techniques that are available to

09:43.020 --> 09:49.160
science fiction writers, largely that's just a matter of perceived opportunity.

09:50.260 --> 09:57.060
People now realize that it is possible, because people have demonstrated it by doing it,

09:57.660 --> 10:04.180
that it is possible to have good characterization in a science fiction story, not simply surface

10:04.180 --> 10:08.040
characterization, where you can tell a villain because they were a black ass or something.

10:11.120 --> 10:17.660
And there was a lot of experimentalism that went on in the 60s, and indeed it is still going on to

10:17.660 --> 10:25.280
some extent. But I think that today there's, I characterize the whole change as broadening

10:25.280 --> 10:30.740
and opening up the entire field. I don't think there's anything that can be done in any branch

10:30.740 --> 10:35.920
of literature that can't be done, also in science fiction, with the added dimension of the speculation

10:35.920 --> 10:44.620
about the future. Okay, good. We usually ask the authors we talk to also to give their impression

10:44.620 --> 10:49.820
of the old conflicts, say, between science fiction and the mainstream. Some authors think that

10:50.360 --> 10:55.640
science fiction deserves its own special category, that it's unique and fans and authors want to

10:55.640 --> 11:00.200
keep it that way. Other people feel that there should be really no separation between science

11:00.200 --> 11:04.520
fiction and mainstream, and it's only an artificial thing done by the publishing industry. Do you

11:04.520 --> 11:14.480
have any opinions on that? I think both those things are true. It's an artificial thing done

11:14.480 --> 11:23.120
by the publishing industry because they found that it's a real thing among readers, and it's

11:23.120 --> 11:30.520
not just in science fiction, it's in any genre. If you want to read a novel about, oh, whatever,

11:30.780 --> 11:36.920
there's a class of novels primarily for women, for instance, in which women discover their

11:36.920 --> 11:41.460
sexuality or how to control their lives or things like that. Those were very popular recently.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.240
There's a particular way of packaging such a novel. If you want to read a Gothic,

11:48.100 --> 11:52.820
that there's a particular way of packaging that or a Western or something like that.

11:53.800 --> 11:59.060
And even a mainstream novel, there's a particular way of packaging that, a particular kind of cover,

11:59.200 --> 12:04.880
particular type styles that have been found to be more effective than others. Everything that is

12:04.880 --> 12:12.940
published is a genre. Mainstream itself is a genre. As for writing it, I don't think that people

12:12.940 --> 12:17.700
should approach the writing of science fiction as anything other than simply writing a story,

12:17.760 --> 12:22.540
which happens to be science fiction. I think they should be aware, however, of what's been done

12:22.540 --> 12:27.480
in science fiction before so they don't repeat everything. It really gets embarrassing when

12:27.480 --> 12:34.620
you see a very good writer who hasn't worked in science fiction before turn to science fiction and

12:34.880 --> 12:40.040
produce something that is just old hat. It's been done in science fiction for 50 years.

12:40.420 --> 12:45.360
You get embarrassed with this person. John Updike did a short story in New Yorker about three years

12:45.360 --> 12:49.760
ago and it's just embarrassing because he obviously didn't know the feel.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.160
So I think that anybody who is writing science fiction today

12:55.880 --> 12:59.980
should simply approach it as telling the very best story that he or she can.

13:02.160 --> 13:08.840
And not underestimating the audience, but knowing the audience, knowing what they like the most.

13:09.520 --> 13:15.340
And if you want to tell a story that's heavy on philosophy or something like that, you've got to

13:15.340 --> 13:20.560
know how to make the people enjoy it while you're doing it. But you have to know that when you're

13:20.560 --> 13:25.420
writing any kind of story. You have to know your audience. You have to write to people. You can't

13:25.420 --> 13:29.620
live the old idea of writing from your soul and just putting it out there pure. It's

13:29.620 --> 13:35.040
absolutely nonsense to me. I mean that's just babbling. You may as well just keep it tiring.

13:35.740 --> 13:39.320
If you want to write and be read by other people, you've got to give them enjoyment.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.660
That doesn't mean that you have to write to them as though they were 12 years old.

13:46.020 --> 13:49.180
Because if you give them a really solid,

13:53.180 --> 13:58.500
a really solid piece of writing, if it is good, if it is a quality piece of writing,

13:59.160 --> 14:04.040
it's going to find its audience. A quality piece of writing is something that is enjoyable.

14:04.560 --> 14:09.760
Curious, if it isn't enjoyable, there is no quality to it. I don't believe any of these people who

14:09.760 --> 14:18.700
talk about downbeat fiction, for instance, as being depressing. I suppose, you know, if you read too

14:18.700 --> 14:24.480
much of it at a time, it can be, but a given story, even if the ending is, you know, everybody dies

14:24.480 --> 14:31.200
or the main character shoots herself or something, if the story is a valid story and has an emotional

14:31.200 --> 14:38.540
impact and tells you something about the quality of life, then I don't get the impression of that.

14:39.800 --> 14:45.140
Because that's a moving experience. I've learned something from it. The most recent story I've

14:45.140 --> 14:50.120
read, as a matter of fact, was The Death of the Iliac by Leo Tolstoy, which is, of course,

14:50.260 --> 14:57.840
the death of a man. It's a classic story. Just to hear that that's what it's about

14:59.020 --> 15:02.860
would perhaps turn a lot of people off and say, oh gee, that's going to be very depressing.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.560
But I don't think so. I read that story and I was delighted with it.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.820
That's kind of rambling, but I suppose that answers your question.

15:12.840 --> 15:18.060
Well, that's fine. That's going to make the whole show by itself. Listen, I had two more questions.

15:18.480 --> 15:23.540
You can make the answers as brief as you'd like. I want you to say just a little bit about fantasy,

15:23.740 --> 15:28.880
in particular, in one of your fantasy annals. I think it was number three. You said that the

15:28.880 --> 15:32.960
level of writing in fantasy you thought was probably higher than it was in science fiction.

15:33.580 --> 15:37.200
Could you comment on that and maybe say a word as to why fantasy has become so popular?

15:39.120 --> 15:43.100
I'm not sure why fantasy has become so popular, so I can't comment on that.

15:44.860 --> 15:48.820
The only guess I can make is that there does seem to be a correlation between

15:49.700 --> 15:57.040
periods of economic depression and popularity of pure fantasy. People just seem to want to get

15:57.040 --> 16:03.560
away from that more. But that's a guess. As to the quality of the writing, it's simply a technical

16:03.560 --> 16:09.080
matter. It's very difficult in writing about the future, about other worlds,

16:10.480 --> 16:17.780
and strange creatures and so forth. To write with the kind of precise detail that you can write

16:17.780 --> 16:24.880
about the present day, writing about things that you see every day, hear every day, smell every day,

16:24.880 --> 16:33.300
and it's simply technically more easy to pick out details in a scene to tell

16:33.990 --> 16:39.710
that will be recognizable immediately to a reader. There are many examples of

16:41.920 --> 16:46.280
mainstream writers who can set a scene with a single sentence or a single paragraph,

16:46.660 --> 16:52.460
or can tell you enormous amounts of information about what's going on, simply by

16:53.500 --> 17:00.260
naming things. There's a famous story by J. D. Fallinger in which he spends one paragraph

17:00.260 --> 17:05.140
telling you the contents of the medicine cabinet of the glass family. And once you know what's in

17:05.140 --> 17:11.100
their medicine cabinet, you know a whole lot about that family. Now imagine trying to do that

17:12.220 --> 17:19.020
about a family that lives seven million years in the future, or even 700 years in the future.

17:19.820 --> 17:25.040
You wouldn't even know what those things in medicine cabinet were. So it's very difficult to do that

17:25.040 --> 17:30.940
as briefly as you do it in contemporary fiction or any story that's been said in contemporary times.

17:31.780 --> 17:37.020
And since a lot of fantasy is said in contemporary times, fantasy writers have the opportunity to

17:37.020 --> 17:41.820
use that kind of detail. And that's what I meant when I said that the level of writing in fantasy

17:41.820 --> 17:44.520
tends to be higher. It's because it's easier.

17:47.580 --> 17:52.020
Okay, good. My last question then would just be about your own future writing. I wondered what

17:52.460 --> 17:57.060
we can expect from you in terms of your own outputs, say in terms of novels and short stories in the

17:57.060 --> 18:03.720
future. Are you planning on going ahead and doing some more? Yes, I am. As I say, I'm working on a

18:03.720 --> 18:10.840
couple of very short stories, maybe two or three thousand for each, just because I have a couple

18:10.840 --> 18:16.120
of ideas I want to write. There are a couple of editors who are interested in them. But mainly,

18:16.240 --> 18:20.800
right now, I'm working on a new novel, which we published probably by Timescape next year.

18:21.960 --> 18:30.280
And it'll be quite, quite different from CERC. But it'll be very much the same kind of novel in

18:30.280 --> 18:37.360
that it will have an adventure story up front, which I hope will be interesting. But it'll have a lot

18:37.360 --> 18:42.200
of stuff under the surface, not necessarily symbolism as such. But there's building a lot of

18:42.200 --> 18:51.620
characterization. I'm going to be working with mythic archetypes again here. I don't know exactly

18:51.620 --> 18:55.140
what I'm going to be doing with that yet. I've worked out all the details. It's still very early

18:55.140 --> 19:02.100
in the book. But I think it's going to be very interesting. Okay, is there anything at all,

19:02.100 --> 19:06.500
any kinds of ideas or crusades or things you're interested in that you'd like to

19:07.040 --> 19:18.120
to say before we finish? The only crusade I have currently is against people who use the term

19:18.120 --> 19:23.220
sci-fi. And I'm sure you've heard that before. I don't think I have to explain it. Anybody who

19:23.220 --> 19:30.020
says sci-fi around me, might as well call me a nigger. Yeah, okay, we can understand that.

19:31.080 --> 19:36.520
And I tell this to everybody. You obviously don't use this term, but a number of people who have

19:36.520 --> 19:43.140
interviewed me have used that term. And I always say, you know, do not use that term or I'm simply

19:43.140 --> 19:46.240
going to hang up the phone or I'm going to walk out of the television studio.

19:49.280 --> 19:56.060
Yeah, I can agree with that totally. Okay, listen, what we do now, we will, these shows are usually

19:56.760 --> 20:00.160
aired maybe two months or so after we interview them, you know, after the interview,

20:00.760 --> 20:05.740
we will send you the completed tapes of the show. Great, yeah, I do want to see that.

20:06.660 --> 20:12.360
At this point, we premiered our show premiered April 5th and the network has not yet sent us

20:12.360 --> 20:17.140
a list of stations which carry us around the country. When we get that, we can also shoot that to you.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.640
Yeah, I'd like to have that too, thank you. Yeah, Mr. Carr, as I understand it currently,

20:21.640 --> 20:26.740
there aren't any stations in the, in fact, I don't think we have any stations in California yet.

20:27.120 --> 20:32.020
We go as far west as Montana, but we haven't quite made it to the West Coast.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.420
Well, it isn't that important that my friends hear me.

20:39.260 --> 20:44.140
Okay, listen, you might, just before we hang up here, you might, you might give us a little bit

20:44.140 --> 20:51.620
of advice because, you know, in your experiences as an editor, we've been doing this show for a

20:51.620 --> 20:55.500
and we've interviewed an enormous number of science fiction authors. We have some pretty

20:55.500 --> 21:00.700
valuable material, you know, some excellent interviews with Jack Williamson, a EVAN vote,

21:00.840 --> 21:08.240
you know, some of the old timers and stuff. We think that if we type these up in an interview form,

21:08.240 --> 21:11.520
you know, that we would have a good chance of getting a book published, you know, of interviews.

21:12.680 --> 21:16.100
Who might we contact or how might we go about that? Do you have any advice?

21:17.280 --> 21:22.340
I have very little advice on that. I'll tell you that there are a lot of people who are doing

21:22.340 --> 21:26.440
interviews these days and you're probably aware that there have been a number of

21:26.440 --> 21:31.160
interviews published, most recently, Charles Blaspho, Greenbakers, and McCall.

21:32.880 --> 21:39.460
But there are a number of others. And for instance, there's a radio station, WCAI, or

21:40.360 --> 21:47.060
KBFA out here, excuse me, WCAI, or the Pacifica radio station out here. I've been doing a

21:47.060 --> 21:52.700
science fiction interview show for about nine or four or five years now and they have an enormous

21:52.700 --> 21:58.040
number of pages of very good interviews too and they're interested in telling me stuff. So I don't

21:58.040 --> 22:04.580
know what they're doing. What you might do, the one person who could tell you a lot more than I

22:04.580 --> 22:10.800
could would be Richard Luthor, who lives in either Oakland or Berkeley, I think, Berkeley,

22:11.800 --> 22:18.020
Claremont Avenue. And he's more or less connected with that radio show, so he will know what they've

22:18.020 --> 22:23.600
been doing about trying to find a publisher. I suggest you call him and find out what he knows

22:23.600 --> 22:27.740
the right term, whatever. You'll know a whole lot more, I think.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.960
Okay, yeah, we realize a lot of people have been doing interviews. Okay, listen, we've taken

22:33.960 --> 22:37.160
enough of your time. This has taken longer than I thought it would, but it's been an excellent

22:37.160 --> 22:42.420
interview and we want to thank you very much for it. And good, you had a good question. Yeah,

22:42.440 --> 22:45.180
well, we had a lot more, but it's getting kind of, you know, it's getting kind of late. Well,

22:45.200 --> 22:53.000
back here it's getting kind of late. Out there it isn't, but listen, when your next novel comes up,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.420
or maybe one of your anthologies or something, we might want to update some of the shows,

22:56.520 --> 22:59.520
we might drop you a line and talk to you for a little time sometime in the future again.

23:00.320 --> 23:03.920
Okay, let's do it. Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Karm. Okay, bye now. Bye.
