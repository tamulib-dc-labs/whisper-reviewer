00:08.580 --> 00:12.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.260 --> 00:33.580
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.920
And here are your hosts.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.860
This is Daryl A. and David Carson.

00:44.260 --> 00:47.600
Chad Oliver has never really been able to devote himself fully to writing science fiction,

00:47.800 --> 00:49.420
though he's been publishing it for over 30 years.

00:49.740 --> 00:53.680
He's also a teacher, a professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin.

00:54.140 --> 00:57.580
As is true with many science fiction authors, Oliver starred as a writer, resulted from

00:57.580 --> 00:59.320
his fascination with reading science fiction.

00:59.620 --> 01:03.560
As a teenager, he discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs and his lush Martian stories and tried to get

01:03.560 --> 01:05.200
his hands on everything Burroughs published.

01:05.800 --> 01:11.140
Because of the addiction to Burroughs, one time when I was in a newsstand I saw a copy

01:11.140 --> 01:14.480
of the big old fat amazing stories.

01:16.180 --> 01:24.040
And it had a cover story by Burroughs called Tiger Girl and also a story by Eando Bender.

01:24.220 --> 01:30.080
You remember him or rather you remember them, Earl and Otto, called Adam Link saves the

01:30.080 --> 01:30.240
world.

01:30.240 --> 01:35.220
Anyway, I bought the copy of Amazing because I wanted to read the Burroughs story and I

01:35.220 --> 01:37.520
figured well I might as well read all this other stuff too.

01:38.040 --> 01:45.080
And there was a story in there by Edmund Hamilton called Treasure on Thunder Moon which I read

01:45.080 --> 01:47.180
and was immediately hooked.

01:47.320 --> 01:51.360
I thought this was the greatest thing I had ever read, maybe the greatest thing anybody

01:51.360 --> 01:52.140
had ever written.

01:52.900 --> 01:57.320
And I decided well by golly the thing to be is to be a professional writer and to write

01:57.320 --> 01:58.100
science fiction.

01:58.100 --> 02:08.880
And I got a second hand portable typewriter and I taught myself to type and I wrote something

02:09.880 --> 02:15.440
every week between the time I was 14 and when I was 21 when I sold my first story.

02:15.980 --> 02:17.940
And sent it all off.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.220
Editors were just immensely helpful.

02:21.620 --> 02:24.060
I never got form rejection slips.

02:24.860 --> 02:29.440
Even at 14 years old you can imagine the kind of junk you were writing at 14.

02:30.360 --> 02:34.860
But people like Sam Merlin for example would write me a little note, you know, we can't

02:34.860 --> 02:36.800
use this but keep trying and so forth.

02:37.760 --> 02:45.280
And in effect what really happened was that I got hooked on science fiction and I just

02:45.280 --> 02:47.600
thought science fiction writers must be gods.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.460
And I wanted to be one.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.860
I figured that's as close to a god as I could get.

02:53.100 --> 02:58.020
So I went at it and I kept writing until I sold my first story and I sold every one

02:58.020 --> 02:58.700
I've written since.

03:06.260 --> 03:10.280
But Oliver was also pursuing an academic career and he took a master's degree in English

03:10.280 --> 03:11.420
from the University of Texas.

03:11.740 --> 03:15.520
His master's thesis was written on magazine science fiction, the first academic thesis

03:15.520 --> 03:17.040
written on that particular subject.

03:17.340 --> 03:21.020
With a degree in English you might have expected Oliver to become an English teacher or a full

03:21.020 --> 03:22.240
time writer of science fiction.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.960
We asked him why he didn't become either.

03:25.080 --> 03:33.740
Actually I was briefly, after I got my MA I taught English at the University for one

03:33.740 --> 03:39.760
year and there were two troubles that were involved in that situation.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.700
From my point of view I don't know what troubles the students had.

03:43.880 --> 03:50.460
But the two troubles were basically that by the time I had started to teach English I

03:50.460 --> 03:54.740
was so much into anthropology that I already knew that that's what I wanted to do.

03:55.580 --> 03:59.820
And I really was just teaching the English because I had told Ransom I would.

04:01.580 --> 04:06.820
And the other aspect of it was there's nothing like teaching freshman English for a year

04:06.820 --> 04:10.060
to convince you that that's not what you want to do for the rest of your life.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.740
So that was the end of it.

04:12.940 --> 04:16.640
I left then went to UCLA to graduate school in anthropology.

04:18.020 --> 04:21.660
I know that doesn't answer the question about why I didn't become a full time professional

04:21.660 --> 04:22.100
writer.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.480
But I'm not sure I can answer that question.

04:25.780 --> 04:30.640
Tony Boucher once said to me, sooner or later you're going to have to choose.

04:31.540 --> 04:32.840
And I never did.

04:33.260 --> 04:39.100
And I suppose that one reason was that I was particularly at that time when I was, you

04:39.100 --> 04:41.060
know, a hundred years younger than I am now.

04:41.920 --> 04:45.200
I was just as interested in anthropology as I was in writing.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.360
And I really wanted to teach anthropology.

04:48.340 --> 04:51.980
And so I tried to do both that was within different success.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.440
More of Science Fiction author, Chad Oliver, next time.

05:02.640 --> 05:07.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:07.040 --> 05:11.280
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:57.220 --> 05:59.940
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

06:00.180 --> 06:01.180
So stay with us.

06:17.220 --> 06:22.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:25.180 --> 06:26.580
And here are your hosts.

06:30.680 --> 06:31.800
This is David Carson.

06:32.080 --> 06:32.720
And Daryl Lane.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.640
Chad Oliver has been publishing science fiction for more than three decades.

06:36.280 --> 06:40.340
His novels include Shadows in the Sun, The Winds of Time, The Shores of Another Sea,

06:40.480 --> 06:41.460
and Giants in the Dust.

06:41.740 --> 06:44.960
He's also had a couple of short story collections published, but he's always had to do his

06:44.960 --> 06:46.040
writing in a spare time.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.800
Professional anthropologist.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.700
He teaches anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.000
And he's also chairman of the Anthropology Department.

06:53.980 --> 07:00.400
Actually I was chairman of the Department of Anthropology from 1967 to 1971.

07:01.840 --> 07:06.880
And when I resigned, I swore I would never do it again under any circumstances whatsoever.

07:07.680 --> 07:12.880
And so here I am in the third year of my second chairmanship.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.900
And I figure I've got one year to go.

07:16.820 --> 07:19.900
And then somebody else is going to take over.

07:20.740 --> 07:25.680
And hopefully I can get back to writing not on a full time basis, but I can sure write

07:25.680 --> 07:28.140
more than I can when I'm tied up with the chairmanship.

07:28.340 --> 07:29.580
It's really a full time job.

07:30.580 --> 07:34.820
With a distinguished career at the University, Oliver still spends time writing science fiction.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.540
We have to buy for the money.

07:37.180 --> 07:42.660
No, I really think that writing is something you have to do.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.920
And at any rate, that's the way it is with me.

07:48.080 --> 07:54.660
When I go a certain length of time without writing anything or trying to write something,

07:54.900 --> 07:58.420
I get actually physically uncomfortable with it.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.360
And it's definitely a labor of love.

08:01.360 --> 08:06.340
I think of myself as an anthropologist who occasionally writes a story.

08:07.060 --> 08:11.000
I think that the way to be forever is I really live.

08:11.900 --> 08:18.320
What I am is a writer who got interested in anthropology rather than the other way around.

08:19.020 --> 08:22.000
And it means more to me, I think.

08:22.180 --> 08:24.560
It's more gratifying than anything else.

08:25.660 --> 08:27.140
I just pulled a story.

08:28.340 --> 08:31.500
It's an analog, a story called Ghost Town.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.960
It's going to be out in either September or October, if you will.

08:36.680 --> 08:45.100
And I was thrilled when analog, and it's almost like I'd never told a story before.

08:45.720 --> 08:50.280
And it's infinitely important from the other things when I did.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.000
It's an analog.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.340
Oliver is recognized for his use of anthropology in science fiction,

09:01.680 --> 09:03.800
and it's probably the first science fiction author to do so.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.200
He's even had one of his novels, Shadows in the Sun, reviewed in the anthropology journal.

09:08.540 --> 09:11.360
We estimate the use of anthropology as deliberate.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.800
It's a sound like sound.

09:14.360 --> 09:18.100
But it was certainly nothing that I'd set down and planned.

09:18.660 --> 09:23.540
Like, here's an effective way to teach anthropology that I'm going to do with a three-science fiction.

09:25.000 --> 09:32.020
I really think that the actual proof of the situation is that any writer writes about other things that they know.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.180
And one of the things that I knew was anthropology.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.260
So it's more or less natural.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.680
A fair amount of my writing is rooted in anthropology.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.220
But by no means all of it.

09:43.220 --> 09:49.060
And it's particularly important in the short of the stories that I like the most.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.100
I don't know what anybody else might like about it.

09:51.740 --> 09:55.160
It's kind of a story that you don't have anything to do with anthropology at all.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.520
Although, you know, I don't even go on about this.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.960
I'm just about to rally on.

10:01.740 --> 10:08.700
But at the point of the influence that you can frequently ask much at the same time,

10:08.700 --> 10:09.480
and I'm just going to start with a question.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.660
Among them, what does it mean to be human?

10:13.300 --> 10:15.220
Where are we going and where are we going?

10:16.320 --> 10:24.520
And it seems to me that if you're involved seriously in the field, you tend to fall into the other one.

10:25.500 --> 10:30.040
I would guess, I don't know whether anybody's ever actually counted enough.

10:30.740 --> 10:37.540
But I suppose something like 50% of my writing, perhaps, is rooted directly in anthropology.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.440
But there's a sense that it isn't.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.920
We'll continue talking with Chad Oliver on our next show.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.300
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:51.580 --> 10:54.200
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:54.200 --> 10:57.360
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:44.900 --> 11:49.060
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:04.660 --> 12:09.920
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.260
And here are your hosts.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.240
This is Daryl Lane.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.120
And David Carson.

12:20.540 --> 12:25.300
Chad Oliver's 1976 Science Fiction novel, Giants in the Dust, illustrates his background in anthropology.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.640
The book is based on an idea of an earth that is stagnant and lethargic.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.420
Everything man wants, he has.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.020
There are no challenges and as a result, no happiness.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.940
A man named Varnum and some companions have their brains wiped clean of all memories,

12:37.280 --> 12:39.880
and they're sent to another planet, uninhabited but earth-like.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.820
The idea is to have mankind start fresh and see if he'll make the same mistakes

12:43.820 --> 12:45.800
or take some alternate evolutionary path.

12:46.160 --> 12:50.360
With that in mind, the humans are left on the planet with no technological aid whatsoever.

12:50.880 --> 12:56.120
Varnum himself is a throwback, a tough hunter who hasn't succumbed to the softness and lethargy of the rest of humanity.

12:56.480 --> 13:00.040
When the humans reach the point, we begin to domesticate animals and practice agriculture.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.160
Varnum's stopping them.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.220
We asked Oliver why.

13:02.620 --> 13:05.220
Wouldn't Varnum's action and effect prevent civilization from developing?

13:06.220 --> 13:11.800
Well actually, the funny thing about giants in the dust, there are lots of funny things about giants in the dust,

13:12.980 --> 13:19.280
including the fact that that's not my title, and I have the faintest idea of what giants in the dust means

13:19.740 --> 13:22.140
in the context of that particular novel.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.880
I called it go back, go back.

13:24.920 --> 13:29.920
But it's about a kind of anthropology that most people are not familiar with.

13:29.920 --> 13:36.700
You know, almost all the anthropology and science fiction comes out really of the old Franz Boas,

13:36.760 --> 13:39.920
Ruth Benedict, cultural relativism position.

13:41.020 --> 13:45.820
And there's a whole new school in anthropology, if you can call it a school,

13:46.300 --> 13:51.100
and not just in anthropology because it gets into sociobiology and all sorts of things,

13:52.360 --> 13:56.640
which states in effect, you know, that there's more to human beings at birth

13:56.640 --> 14:00.800
than just being the traditional tabula rasa that there's some things built in.

14:01.880 --> 14:06.280
And what I was trying to do in giants in the dust or what was going on there

14:06.280 --> 14:12.720
was really to take the old deal about, suppose you took 50 people, 25 male, 25 female,

14:12.820 --> 14:15.900
and you cast them away on the traditional desert island.

14:16.520 --> 14:21.380
What would happen to them if they could somehow survive from infancy and grow into adulthood?

14:22.380 --> 14:32.340
And one possibility that hasn't been considered is that we have a kind of culture building device within us

14:32.340 --> 14:38.640
and that we would recreate a good deal of culture much more quickly than is usually assumed.

14:39.260 --> 14:42.860
And I was playing around with that idea in giants in the dust.

14:43.120 --> 14:49.300
And the reason why Varnum stops these various inventions and things

14:49.300 --> 14:53.460
is because he wants to give it time to unfold to see what will happen.

14:54.080 --> 14:59.080
But you may recall Varnum's the only character in the book who retains any memory.

14:59.780 --> 15:07.260
And at the end of the book, he finally decides that ethically the only thing he can do is to tell him,

15:07.480 --> 15:12.840
tell the other people, tell what he remembers of the culture back on earth,

15:13.100 --> 15:15.780
and to give them a fairer shot at what's going on.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.160
Final occurrences

15:31.160 --> 15:39.520
No, I wasn't. I think you can construct an argument to the effect that people

15:39.520 --> 15:43.060
in other kinds of societies, particularly hunting and gathering societies

15:43.060 --> 15:50.460
societies have some things that we don't have. It's not all one sided. Civilization

15:50.460 --> 15:57.520
is not an unmixed blessing. And people who live in those banned type of societies, they

15:57.520 --> 16:04.180
tend to be freer from stress. They tend to have fewer emotional problems than people

16:04.180 --> 16:11.160
who live in societies such as our own. And so I don't think it's a completely insane

16:11.160 --> 16:15.880
argument to say, you know, maybe we'd all be better off if we were still hunters and

16:15.880 --> 16:22.880
gatherers. But no, it's not a position I would advocate because I don't think it's a, it's

16:22.880 --> 16:26.720
not a realistic proposition outside the world of fantasy.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.620
Morpchett Oliver, next time.

16:35.340 --> 16:40.460
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:40.460 --> 16:44.240
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:29.960 --> 17:33.760
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:49.100 --> 17:58.520
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy. And here are

17:58.520 --> 18:07.020
your hosts. This is David Carson in Beryl Lane. In a recent science fiction story, Chet

18:07.020 --> 18:11.320
Oliver raises an interesting question. A man colonized a space, will the human race

18:11.320 --> 18:15.740
split into two separate species, spacers and earthers? The story is entitled, meanwhile,

18:15.940 --> 18:20.500
back on the reservation, and it appeared in the 1981 edition of Analog Magazine. As the

18:20.500 --> 18:24.600
title suggests, Earth becomes sort of a reservation containing the backwash of human culture,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.640
while the other worlds colonized by humans become the progressive mainstream of mankind's

18:28.640 --> 18:32.760
culture. We asked Oliver if he thought such a situation could occur as we move that into

18:32.760 --> 18:39.380
space. I think it's possible. Really, the genesis of,

18:40.180 --> 18:47.600
meanwhile, back on the reservation with two-fold. And one would simply be the kind of reaction

18:47.600 --> 18:53.460
that builds up in you when everybody talks about, hey, you know, here's the glorious

18:53.460 --> 18:59.460
future coming onward to the stars, everybody. When you stop and realize everybody's not

18:59.460 --> 19:10.680
going, and in fact 99.99% of the human population will live and die on this planet, and you've

19:10.680 --> 19:17.340
got to wonder, well, what about them? Are they people too? And it's anthropological,

19:17.340 --> 19:23.780
I think, primarily in the sense of they're in the same boat that so-called primitive

19:23.780 --> 19:30.760
peoples are on this planet today, that the march of culture, for one of another term,

19:31.420 --> 19:38.040
has passed them by to some extent. And they're sort of islands that are left in the stream

19:38.040 --> 19:43.980
and left behind, and yet they have all the problems of living the face that anybody else

19:43.980 --> 19:49.560
does. And I was just trying to raise the question, well, all right, what about the people who

19:49.560 --> 19:54.680
stay behind? Do we just write them off? Are they ciphers, or aren't they just as important

19:54.680 --> 19:57.780
to somebody that goes off to Alpha Centaurus or someplace?

20:03.560 --> 20:07.400
Oliver's been publishing science fiction for over 30 years, and for a good part of that

20:07.400 --> 20:10.980
time he's lived in Austin, Texas, and taught anthropology at the University of Texas.

20:11.420 --> 20:15.140
Oliver goes on to talk about, meanwhile, back on the reservation and reveals some interesting

20:15.140 --> 20:19.100
information about his background as a science fiction writer, and also about science fiction

20:19.100 --> 20:19.800
writers in Texas.

20:20.600 --> 20:25.860
The other thing that was involved in that story was that I had not written any short fiction

20:25.860 --> 20:34.600
in a while, and I got mixed up with the Turkey City group in Austin, which has been a source

20:34.600 --> 20:43.080
of untold joy in my life. And a number of people who were involved in that group, Lisa Tuttle

20:43.080 --> 20:48.960
and Howard Waldrop and a number of others, had urged me to try to do something again,

20:49.400 --> 20:55.260
not wait so long between stories. And meanwhile, back on the reservations, actually the first

20:55.260 --> 21:04.540
story I ever wrote that I submitted to criticism from other writers, and I learned a lot from

21:04.540 --> 21:10.540
them, and it was a very rewarding experience. And I can't tell you what a thrill it is for

21:10.540 --> 21:17.360
me to be living in some place like Austin and to find a whole colony of professional

21:17.360 --> 21:22.140
science fiction writers there, and not just there, but the fact that they're so good.

21:22.760 --> 21:28.060
You know, for something like 20 years, I was all alone in Texas. The closest thing there

21:28.060 --> 21:32.760
was to a science fiction convention or gathering in the old days was when Walt Miller and I

21:32.760 --> 21:38.940
got together for a six pack of beer and Kyle. And this is a brand new experience for me,

21:38.940 --> 21:45.320
and it's comparable only to the situation I was in when I was in Los Angeles in graduate

21:45.320 --> 21:52.360
school. And Ray Bradbury and Chuck Beaumont and Bill Nolan and Dick Matheson and all of

21:52.360 --> 21:57.140
us would get together and talk about stories. But we never criticized each other's manuscripts

21:57.140 --> 22:03.440
in a more or less formal session like that. Instead, you know, somebody would write something

22:03.440 --> 22:06.720
and if there was somebody they liked, they'd take it, hey, look at this, you know, you think

22:06.720 --> 22:11.260
I can do anything with it. And then 20 years more or less by myself, really.

22:12.100 --> 22:13.460
More next time with Chad Oliver.

22:20.920 --> 22:25.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

22:25.700 --> 22:29.520
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.700
Music

23:10.320 --> 23:10.860
Music

23:14.660 --> 23:18.660
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:22.260 --> 23:23.040
Music

23:26.280 --> 23:27.060
Music

23:34.280 --> 23:39.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:40.840 --> 23:41.620
Music

23:42.650 --> 23:44.020
And here are your hosts.

23:45.340 --> 23:46.120
Music

23:48.180 --> 23:49.280
This is Daryl Lane.

23:49.480 --> 23:50.120
And David Carson.

23:50.400 --> 23:55.000
The Shores of Another Sea, Chad Oliver's 1971 Science Fiction novel, was partially based

23:55.000 --> 23:58.200
on the author's experience when he did some anthropological research in Africa.

23:58.520 --> 24:03.000
The novel concerns alien contact, a standard science fiction theme. The contact is made

24:03.000 --> 24:05.320
when some aliens land in a remote area of Africa.

24:05.700 --> 24:09.560
And the aliens are very cautious. They don't present themselves to humans. They use baboons

24:09.560 --> 24:13.520
at first, studying them and taking over their bodies in order to approach men without being

24:13.520 --> 24:13.880
detected.

24:14.200 --> 24:18.220
But a man named Royce Crawford, a scientist studying the baboons, becomes aware of the

24:18.220 --> 24:22.440
aliens' presence. He can't go for help though, because a storm washes out the roads and

24:22.440 --> 24:23.740
acylates him from civilization.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.020
We asked Oliver if the setting was based on the time he spent in Africa.

24:28.200 --> 24:40.680
Yes, it was. The Shores of Another Sea is at least rooted in the 17 months or so that

24:40.680 --> 24:46.960
I spent in Kenya and East Africa when I was on a research job with a people called the

24:46.960 --> 24:57.060
Comba. And some aspects of the Shores of Another Sea are real, some are invented, as is true

24:57.060 --> 25:05.480
in any fiction. But to be specific, the storm and the rains and the isolation that form a

25:05.480 --> 25:12.980
major part of the Shores of Another Sea, that all happened. And I was marined for a period

25:12.980 --> 25:17.860
of some weeks at what was, I forget what I called it in the novel, I may even have used

25:17.860 --> 25:24.700
it as a real name, which was the Derajani Research Station. And when those rains came

25:24.700 --> 25:32.180
down, they simply knocked out all communications. And the thought just occurred to me. You know,

25:32.180 --> 25:40.600
suppose you were going to contact this earth and you had to begin somewhere. Would you

25:40.600 --> 25:45.620
really plunk your ship down in the middle of New York City the way they always do? Or

25:45.620 --> 25:51.060
would you try at first in a controllable type of situation where you could deal with small

25:51.060 --> 25:56.260
numbers and related species? And wouldn't it be interesting if you started off with some

25:56.260 --> 26:01.840
other form of primate like a baboon? And that's where the Shores of Another Sea came from.

26:01.840 --> 26:07.940
But if you go back and read the book, or at least if I go back and look at it, what I see

26:07.940 --> 26:13.000
are all kinds of detailed memories of what actually happened in Kenya right down to the

26:13.000 --> 26:18.080
level of the pipe tobacco I was smoking there, which was called Sweet Nut and came in a yellow

26:18.080 --> 26:20.060
tin and was perfectly awful.

26:30.140 --> 26:35.140
At one point in the novel, Royce Crawford has a huge waterbuck in the sights of his rifle. He's

26:35.140 --> 26:39.220
always dreamed of shooting this animal, but he chooses not to. We asked Oliver if Crawford's

26:39.220 --> 26:47.320
decision resulted from his experiences with the aliens. Sure. The scene in which the would-be

26:47.320 --> 26:54.680
hunter finally has a chance to shoot the animal that he's always dreamed about and elects to

26:54.680 --> 27:02.600
let it go free. That's an analog of what is going on in the rest of the book as well, which is

27:02.600 --> 27:10.680
you have an opportunity or you encounter aliens. And if you simply treat them the way one

27:10.680 --> 27:17.200
human being hopefully might treat another under the best of circumstances, maybe this kind of

27:17.200 --> 27:24.660
encounter is going to hold more promise than either a situation where they come out with ray guns

27:24.660 --> 27:32.440
blasting or one where there's some involved Machiavellian plot. The notion that I was really

27:32.440 --> 27:40.220
playing around with there was simply maybe the level of communication is going to have to take

27:40.220 --> 27:48.240
place on the level of look there's some good in us, there's some good in you. Let's try to find the common ground.

27:49.020 --> 27:53.200
This show ends our week with Chad Oliver. If you're interested in further discussions with him, keep

27:53.200 --> 27:56.520
listening to the Science Fiction Radio Show. We'll be talking with him again in the future.

28:04.100 --> 28:08.800
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show. Production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

28:08.800 --> 28:12.640
