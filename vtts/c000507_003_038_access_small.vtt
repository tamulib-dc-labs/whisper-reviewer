00:08.820 --> 00:12.780
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.820 --> 00:34.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.180 --> 00:38.680
And here are your hosts.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.680
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

00:46.180 --> 00:49.220
Today we're beginning a three part series on science fiction author Lee Killow.

00:49.620 --> 00:54.580
Killow is a Kansas native who wrote several short stories during the 1970s, then produced

00:54.580 --> 00:57.120
four novels in short order in the 1980s.

00:57.460 --> 01:02.080
She began as a writer of hard science fiction, but here we find out how she converted to

01:02.080 --> 01:03.980
the more character oriented variety.

01:05.100 --> 01:09.140
I started out and my interest was mostly in really hard science fiction.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.320
I was a die hard analog reader.

01:13.400 --> 01:18.080
And the first story I ever sold was to analog and it was an analog kind of story.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.280
I haven't sold a story to analog since.

01:22.500 --> 01:27.760
Almost everything I've written since has come out in, the majority of it has come out

01:27.760 --> 01:28.780
in the fantasy science fiction.

01:28.940 --> 01:33.740
I've had one in Galileo and a couple in GIF Magazine before it folded.

01:35.200 --> 01:40.380
But I got more and more interested in people and realizing that hardware wasn't the thing,

01:40.640 --> 01:44.520
that it was people and that people were interesting and what made them tick.

01:45.640 --> 01:53.060
And so the more I started researching that, the more I got interested in what makes society

01:53.060 --> 01:53.620
to click.

01:53.620 --> 01:59.100
And then when I started making up aliens and I started reading a lot of anthropology to

01:59.100 --> 02:04.660
figure out, you know, really how societies go together, the more I read, the more I researched,

02:04.820 --> 02:06.060
the more fascinated I got.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.480
Kilo goes to great lengths to keep the details of her books consistent.

02:11.100 --> 02:14.060
Listeners she explains how she is able to keep track of the minutiae.

02:15.120 --> 02:19.800
I put together a background book before I ever start the novel itself.

02:19.800 --> 02:25.740
It's an amount of work that I know some people find exhausting.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.000
They couldn't do it and still have any energy left to write the book.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.920
But I enjoy it.

02:33.020 --> 02:33.840
I'm very systematic.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.620
I start out with a lot of visual images in my head.

02:39.260 --> 02:46.900
And with vague visual images, you have to have them developed to a very clear image

02:47.520 --> 02:51.840
and you have to find the words for them and get them translated into actual words out

02:51.840 --> 02:53.760
of pictures before you can get them down on paper.

02:54.940 --> 02:58.900
So I do a background book and I do maps of the planet.

02:59.140 --> 03:04.460
I do drawings of the flora and fauna and biogas and these are the people.

03:05.480 --> 03:13.280
And the more I read and read on climatology and planetology, the more complex backgrounds

03:13.280 --> 03:13.620
get.

03:13.960 --> 03:20.600
It takes me about the same amount of time to put a background together but it gets much

03:20.600 --> 03:21.300
more complicated.

03:21.460 --> 03:22.860
Now they're almost finished.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.960
Background is almost as thick as the final manuscript on the book.

03:27.180 --> 03:29.900
Writers have many reasons for applying their trade.

03:30.440 --> 03:35.020
Kelo has an interesting point of view on the role and rewards of writers including herself.

03:36.180 --> 03:38.780
A writer entertains.

03:38.780 --> 03:45.320
And if he thinks that he's creating desolate prose with every line he struggles to put down

03:45.320 --> 03:53.220
and if he's writing for history, then he's probably got pretensions of grandeur.

03:54.820 --> 04:02.620
If I write a book that people buy and read by buying, they give me my money which I need.

04:02.620 --> 04:07.060
And if they enjoy it by reading it, then I'm really happy.

04:08.940 --> 04:15.700
I don't think I would write a book just for money but certainly I want to write something

04:15.700 --> 04:20.000
that is fun for me to write and I want to write something that is fun for readers to read.

04:21.740 --> 04:25.300
Kelo's work sell demand with all's well and they lived happily ever after.

04:25.780 --> 04:27.640
She believes that life is fraught with problems.

04:29.040 --> 04:35.420
There are a lot of large social problems that exist within each book that never get solved.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.640
But people in the book solve their own problems.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.040
They handle their own lives.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.600
And I think maybe that a little bit of personal philosophy of mine comes through that.

04:46.180 --> 04:50.500
I can't solve the world's problems but I can certainly keep control of my own life.

04:51.060 --> 04:54.020
And my belief in that I can pass on.

04:55.660 --> 04:59.000
Join us tomorrow as we look at a few of Lee Kelo's novels.

05:06.580 --> 05:12.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

05:12.080 --> 05:15.280
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:58.780 --> 06:02.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:18.540 --> 06:23.860
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.200
And here are your hosts.

06:32.940 --> 06:35.060
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.020
Today we will continue our discussion of Science Fiction author Lee Kelo.

06:39.640 --> 06:44.920
Perhaps her best-received novel today is the Doppelganger Gambit, a futuristic police procedure mystery novel.

06:45.480 --> 06:50.520
A good deal of the book's appeal lies in its skillful depiction of the interaction between police officers.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.800
We asked Kelo if she got this from first-hand experience.

06:55.340 --> 06:57.860
I haven't had any practical experience in it.

06:57.860 --> 07:03.060
I did have a police officer come up to me at the Science Fiction Convention once when I'd been reading a chapter of Doppelganger.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.400
And he asked me when I worked in law enforcement.

07:07.300 --> 07:15.260
Once I decided I wanted to write a mystery science fiction, I went ahead and did more research.

07:16.020 --> 07:24.120
And I've kept into it, and of course that book itself and others have brought me into contact with more police officers.

07:24.120 --> 07:28.080
And they've passed on a lot of material to me.

07:28.940 --> 07:36.680
And so, sort of actually working in it myself, like I have gotten very familiar with it.

07:37.020 --> 07:45.080
And I suppose I keep reading about it, writing about it, because it was interesting and because I've all done so much research on it.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.180
But it's a shame not to use the material.

07:49.900 --> 07:53.340
Kelo's slang term for a police person in the Doppelganger gambit is Leo.

07:53.780 --> 07:55.920
We asked her to explain the origin of this expression.

07:57.280 --> 08:04.680
I think I was seeing something about law enforcement officers one time, and I noticed that it made Leo.

08:05.160 --> 08:12.180
And I thought, that's great, because it gave rise in my mind to all kinds of connotations.

08:12.180 --> 08:21.300
And I could see police officers enjoying being called Leo because of the lion, the fierce kind of association you get with it.

08:21.440 --> 08:29.680
And therefore calling police stations lion, then, and someone who's likely to be picked up by the police is lion meat.

08:31.340 --> 08:37.080
The memorable lead characters in the Doppelganger gambit, both Leo's, are partnered throughout the book.

08:37.080 --> 08:42.360
They manage to transcend all sexual and philosophical barriers ultimately to solve the case.

08:42.800 --> 08:47.340
Listen as Kelo explains how she came up with the characters of Jana Brill and Mama Maxwell.

09:07.080 --> 09:14.300
For contrast, I gave her a male partner, and I can't remember why I decided to make him black.

09:16.660 --> 09:26.360
One of these things that just kind of happened, somebody later pointed out that I had my female character was the one that was working by the book and procedure,

09:26.600 --> 09:34.040
and my male character was the one who was working on intuition, which is an interesting reverse on the way people generally think of males and females.

09:34.720 --> 09:41.880
And that just sort of happened. The characters sort of balanced one another, but a lot of the balance was unconscious on my part.

09:44.440 --> 09:49.140
Jana Brill and Mama Maxwell are a fascinating pair. We asked Kelo if she plans to use them again.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.900
They were fun characters, and I intend to work with them again.

09:53.700 --> 10:00.700
Kelo wrote another police procedure novel, set in the same future history. This book is called Deadly Silence with a T.

10:00.700 --> 10:05.640
In this novel, Taryn Leos are transported to the planet Egar to function as peace officers.

10:06.460 --> 10:12.780
There they must operate under different rules. Their first duty is to aid the victims of crimes, rather than to pursue the perpetrator.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.800
How did Kelo come up with this role?

10:14.800 --> 10:31.920
I suppose it reflects a little bit of a reaction to some of the things that I've seen in our own culture, where the victim suffers a lot because everybody's so interested in catching the guy who did it.

10:32.140 --> 10:35.760
A lot of times they're not paying too much attention to the victim himself.

10:36.480 --> 10:41.600
In another twist, the Leos must function as defense attorneys when the perpetrator is brought to trial.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.340
Tomorrow, more on Arthur Lee Kelo.

10:51.800 --> 11:00.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:50.180 --> 11:54.200
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:09.980 --> 12:15.320
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.680
And here are your hosts.

12:24.380 --> 12:26.460
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.820
The show today will deal further with the work of Science Fiction author Lee Kelo.

12:30.460 --> 12:35.320
Another novel by Kelo goes by the unlikely title, the Monitor, the Miners, and the Shree.

12:35.900 --> 12:42.000
It differs from the works we discussed previously in that it is said in another future history, one called the Sodality.

12:42.580 --> 12:46.080
Listen as Kelo talks about the origins and the inhabitants of this universe.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.900
It's very peaceful and wonderful and tended to get much more complex and much more violent.

12:58.160 --> 13:02.360
The older I got, the more I realized that people just didn't get along with each other all the time.

13:03.320 --> 13:09.240
I had several short stories that are set in that particular universe, and I'll probably come back to it again.

13:09.520 --> 13:17.760
It's an interesting one because it has a lot of different groups, none of which are human, and offers possibilities for societies and interplays.

13:19.560 --> 13:27.240
An alien, in the future history I have set up the one that most of the novels are in, has a minimal of aliens,

13:27.480 --> 13:31.800
so far we've actually gone on to run across one, which is spacing.

13:33.620 --> 13:45.060
And then of course there's aliens that are on the planet on which the colonists who are in trouble on the invictus land of the book I'm working on

13:45.060 --> 13:46.480
and that's not the moment that has some aliens on it.

13:46.620 --> 13:54.140
But there's a minimal of aliens, and if I want to deal with alien species it's just really easy to go to that other future history,

13:54.260 --> 13:56.880
which has all kinds of aliens running around.

13:58.180 --> 14:03.420
I like to think that it's just being across, being on our same galaxy, it's just on the other side,

14:03.500 --> 14:07.480
way out of contact with us, probably not where we're likely to run into it very soon.

14:09.540 --> 14:15.400
The plot of the Monitor of the Miners in the Shrie is centered about the fact that representatives of the Department of Surveys and Charters

14:15.400 --> 14:21.960
are sent to monitor the world naira, a proscripted world, for any signs of progress among the primitive inhabitants, the Shrie.

14:22.660 --> 14:31.400
The team discovers that a corporation by the name of Imra has been actively mining the planet for 500 years, an action strictly forbidden by the sodality.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.520
The last chapter of the novel is a courtroom scene.

14:35.100 --> 14:39.960
We asked Killow for husband Pat, who happens to be a lawyer, offered her any advice on its content.

14:41.160 --> 14:46.980
In fact, the lawyer half wrote that particular chapter, he was telling me, oh, this character ought to say that,

14:47.240 --> 14:51.020
and then you ought to bring up this point, and then you ought to counter with that legal point.

14:51.640 --> 14:58.440
And the whole chapter definitely got submitted to him for scrutiny as a procedure in logical thinking.

14:58.440 --> 15:04.300
So he's happy at, he's half the creator of that last chapter.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.500
Recently, a book of Killow's short stories appeared under the name Aventine.

15:11.020 --> 15:17.340
This is a collection of loosely connected stories, all set in the city of Aventine, a cultural and fine arts center.

15:18.020 --> 15:22.420
The stories are told from a first person point of view. We asked Killow why she chose this approach.

15:22.420 --> 15:31.860
I like those particular stories from a first person point of view because you can understand then,

15:33.380 --> 15:37.360
the storyteller is always victimized in some way in those particular stories.

15:38.740 --> 15:45.900
And you see inside of him, and you don't see things outside, you just see things entirely from his point of view,

15:45.900 --> 15:48.500
and why you may think he's dumb and getting trapped like that.

15:49.060 --> 15:53.220
Why, you can see why he ends up being victimized.

15:55.100 --> 16:01.460
Besides writing, singing, drawing, dancing, and theater are artistic influences in Killow's background.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.740
It was this experience that helped inspire her to write the Aventine stories.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.120
We asked her how the ideas developed.

16:09.640 --> 16:16.620
Most of those stories came out of images. There'd be like one single image.

16:21.060 --> 16:27.280
I liked the image of a pair of footprints scarlet in sand going away.

16:27.380 --> 16:31.860
The image just kept with me and kept with me until I found a story to go with it.

16:33.140 --> 16:37.680
Lee Killow is a dedicated, conscientious writer from whom we can expect more fine work.

16:45.360 --> 16:50.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:50.860 --> 16:54.040
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:43.820 --> 17:47.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:03.700 --> 18:08.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:11.660 --> 18:13.140
And here are your hosts.

18:17.720 --> 18:18.980
This is David Carson.

18:19.220 --> 18:19.800
And Daryl Lane.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.720
Our show today is about science fiction author Rudy Rucker.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.640
Rucker was trained as a mathematician.

18:25.480 --> 18:31.080
He burst under the science fiction scene in 1981 with one of the most original novels to appear in years, White Light.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.540
But White Light was not the first novel Rucker authored.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.860
I wrote this. I wrote it during summer, not teaching in New York.

19:08.920 --> 19:17.020
And there what I wanted to do with that book was make a strong anarchist statement about the way I felt in that society.

19:17.720 --> 19:24.940
It was, you know, like basically sort of late 60s, really, even though it was really big 70s.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.680
Rucker was unable to sell space-time donuts immediately.

19:29.220 --> 19:32.400
Here he tells us a story behind his very successful White Light.

19:33.260 --> 19:35.860
The way I came to write White Light was kind of weird.

19:37.960 --> 19:41.080
I wrote space-time donuts and I couldn't sell them anywhere.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.260
And finally, on Earth Magazine agreed to serialize it.

19:45.940 --> 19:51.520
And they serialized the first two parts of it and they went out of business.

19:52.980 --> 19:57.480
And at that point I lost my job when I was teaching in New York.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.140
They would give me 10 years of time.

20:01.340 --> 20:06.680
But then I got a grant to go to do mathematics in Germany.

20:07.820 --> 20:09.900
And I got a grant from the German government.

20:10.700 --> 20:14.500
Went to Heidelberg. Went there for, I had a two-year, well, a two-year grant there.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.180
And it's from the Fund Homeboat Foundation.

20:18.180 --> 20:21.160
That's why some of my books are dedicated to Homeboat.

20:23.720 --> 20:29.660
And I got over there and to my delight I discovered that the person in charge of my research

20:29.660 --> 20:31.560
really didn't care about mathematics either.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.080
So I just started writing science fiction.

20:35.980 --> 20:40.420
And I spent about three months trying to solve this problem, continuum problem.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.400
Like that, you know, I knew a lot about it. It's a very difficult problem.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.940
And then I said, well, I'm just going to write a novel about it.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.300
And then I came to write White Light that way.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.460
Which, it's about different levels of affinity.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.720
The packaging of an American edition of White Light made it appear as though the book

20:57.720 --> 21:00.100
were another in a long line of life after life books.

21:00.740 --> 21:02.200
We asked Rucker how this came about.

21:03.780 --> 21:06.800
Well, that was Jim Bain. He was the editor of Ace at that time.

21:07.380 --> 21:10.560
And he bought it. I was happy that he bought it.

21:10.740 --> 21:11.680
You know, he gave me good money.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.820
It was his marketing decision.

21:15.080 --> 21:20.840
He probably thought, well, we can film more copies if we package it as something for

21:22.860 --> 21:27.360
superstitious foolish people instead of packaging it as avant-garde literature.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.300
I imagine he's probably right.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.920
We asked Rucker if he had any input on the packaging.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.240
Well, the one thing I got him to put on the cover was, do you want to see God?

21:38.240 --> 21:41.120
I got him to put that on the back.

21:42.340 --> 21:46.100
We asked Rucker how people who bought the book thinking it was a straight life after life

21:46.100 --> 21:47.560
novel reacted to it.

21:48.520 --> 21:53.520
Well, I've met people since then that are really into like dream stuff and after travel.

21:54.040 --> 21:58.800
Like, they've read it and very seriously and they're just like, don't understand why

21:58.800 --> 22:02.440
the book is sort of not so serious as it should be.

22:03.340 --> 22:05.160
More on Rudy Rucker on our next show.

22:12.360 --> 22:17.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

22:17.160 --> 22:21.000
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.440
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.820
So stay with us.

23:24.600 --> 23:29.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.360
And here are your hosts.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.160
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.600
Today's show continues a discussion on science fiction author Rudy Rucker.

23:45.220 --> 23:48.820
When we asked Rucker if the name White Light was inspired by the so-called White Light,

23:49.260 --> 23:53.420
those who have near-death experiences reportedly see, the answer was a definite no.

23:53.980 --> 23:56.080
Here he explains the actual origin of the title.

23:57.320 --> 24:02.700
White Light, that's like in the 60s when if you took like a whole lot of LSD,

24:03.680 --> 24:08.380
everything would get all white, you know, and then God would talk to you.

24:09.460 --> 24:14.460
And that was like an inexperience that usually you would only get it once because

24:15.300 --> 24:17.660
the media would look out for it the other time.

24:19.540 --> 24:20.840
That's where White Light is.

24:22.960 --> 24:26.540
Rucker's third novel, Software, is written in a more conventional style

24:26.540 --> 24:28.480
than were White Light and Spacetime Donuts.

24:29.020 --> 24:31.400
It differs from these two in another aspect as well.

24:50.840 --> 24:55.740
The young guy who's sort of, you know, based on a guy that I used to hang around with,

24:56.540 --> 25:02.240
a guy younger than me, and the old guy in there is, can extend based on their father.

25:04.080 --> 25:07.760
In Software, a simulacrum of the famous mathematician Girdle,

25:08.120 --> 25:11.200
makes a brief appearance to lecture on Girdle's incompleteness theorem.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.400
This theorem says that humans cannot build robots as intelligent as themselves.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.240
Rucker had several discussions with Girdle shortly before Girdle died.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.360
Listen as he describes the relationship.

25:51.460 --> 25:54.040
I'll think about Girdle when you talk to him.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.160
When I talk to him, I go and make up a list of questions.

25:56.360 --> 26:01.800
I want to ask him about all this stuff, about math and philosophy and physics and so on.

26:02.460 --> 26:07.660
And I keep it sitting alone in Princeton there, like for 30 years.

26:07.980 --> 26:12.080
Like 30 years ago, he approved the heaviest things that anybody had ever done in mathematics.

26:13.020 --> 26:17.120
He'd been like 30 years past that. He was thinking all the time.

26:17.500 --> 26:21.360
And anything I'd ask him, you know, like he'd already been all the way down the road.

26:22.420 --> 26:27.000
And he would just laugh. I mean, a lot of when I talk to him, he'd say a few words and then he'd start laughing.

26:27.660 --> 26:28.820
And I'd start laughing with him.

26:30.100 --> 26:33.980
And like as we would laugh, I would feel like we were communicating.

26:34.480 --> 26:39.040
It was awesome. I mean, it sounds kind of stupid when I say it like this, but awesome.

26:39.620 --> 26:42.000
It was, you know, like a real feeling of telepathy almost.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.200
Like, you know, just anything I'd say you'd totally understand.

26:46.020 --> 26:50.520
Which is really unquestionably the greatest person I've ever made.

26:52.800 --> 26:56.380
The German philosopher Hegel is Rucker several times removed Grandfather.

26:56.940 --> 26:59.980
We asked him if there is any of Hegel's influence in his work.

27:01.300 --> 27:04.380
I think I've done my part, you know, for the absolute.

27:05.420 --> 27:09.300
I really, I'd like to read his stuff and it's pretty hard to read.

27:09.840 --> 27:13.240
I've read books about him, but the actual books are very hard to read.

27:13.860 --> 27:23.840
But it's my impression that I have somewhat the same ideas about the absolute, the absolute being the ultimate thing, the white life.

27:25.760 --> 27:34.700
And I would say, you know, like later people look back and say, well, it's pretty much what Hegel would have wanted to write if he was a scientist.

27:37.600 --> 27:42.500
Rudy Rucker, the science fiction author who plans to continue doing his part for the absolute.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.480
I'm not sure what I'm saying.
