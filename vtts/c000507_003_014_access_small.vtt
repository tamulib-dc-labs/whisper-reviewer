Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.720 --> 00:34.020
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:34.020 --> 00:38.340
And here are your hosts.

00:51.540 --> 00:56.340
Although he appeared in print for the first time in 1969 with a short story in the Science

00:56.340 --> 01:01.320
Fiction Magazine Galaxy, Haldeman gained tremendous popularity when he came out with his multi-award

01:01.320 --> 01:03.020
winning novel, The Forever War.

01:03.380 --> 01:08.300
The novel was serialized in astounding science fiction, starting in 1972, then released as

01:08.300 --> 01:09.380
a book in 1974.

01:10.100 --> 01:14.420
The Forever War is similar to Robert Heinlein's book Starship Troopers, in that both have

01:14.420 --> 01:18.380
intergalactic war, powered body armor, and highly advanced weapons as common elements.

01:19.060 --> 01:22.040
Differences between the books show up in the way the authors treat war.

01:22.540 --> 01:27.460
Heinlein's conflict was sort of a John Wayne-style battle with the bad guys, whereas Haldeman's

01:27.460 --> 01:31.220
dealt with the emotions and reactions of his characters to the war they fought.

01:31.220 --> 01:33.540
We asked Haldeman if the resemblance was intentional.

02:02.420 --> 02:11.580
But no, if there is any relation to any book, it is to my own first novel, War Year, because

02:11.580 --> 02:18.180
it's an expansion into a science fiction universe of the notions that I was trying to express

02:18.180 --> 02:21.100
in mainstream novel.

02:39.400 --> 02:44.180
Haldeman has a background in physics and astronomy, and told us about how he uses his hard science

02:44.180 --> 02:45.340
background in his work.

02:46.340 --> 02:52.520
Well, I try to use it to make the worlds that are in the event more believable, at least

02:52.520 --> 02:56.860
to me, since I do have a background in science and engineering.

02:56.860 --> 03:03.140
I think, well, the writer has to at least suspend his own disbelief while he's making

03:03.140 --> 03:07.760
up these stories, and it's easier for me to do it if it's on a fairly solid scientific

03:07.760 --> 03:08.460
foundation.

03:09.460 --> 03:15.680
Even though my science is rather old fashioned and probably rather sloppy by our real scientists'

03:16.300 --> 03:21.600
standards, it's still enough to convince me, so it's fulfilled its function.

03:28.940 --> 03:32.840
In the Forever War, the soldiers experience time dilation when they travel to and from

03:32.840 --> 03:33.520
the war zone.

03:34.060 --> 03:38.240
That means that due to the tremendous velocity of their spaceships, dozens of years have passed

03:38.240 --> 03:41.880
on Earth, while only a few months have passed for the soldiers on the spaceships.

03:42.420 --> 03:46.500
Haldeman told us how he used hard science to evoke some of the feeling the soldiers have.

03:47.660 --> 03:54.560
It goes deeper than just description, the time dilation in the Forever War.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.800
It's scientifically accurate.

03:56.940 --> 04:05.440
Its main function is metaphorical, and that is to demonstrate how the soldiers who fight

04:05.440 --> 04:09.220
a war become isolated from the culture that they're supposed to be protecting.

04:10.200 --> 04:16.460
It's using a science-fictional device to exaggerate something that happens to every soldier.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.460
I remember when I came back from Vietnam, I was suddenly plunged into what was an alien

04:23.460 --> 04:26.720
culture, even though I'd only been a soldier for two years.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.400
A lot of things had changed.

04:31.200 --> 04:37.440
It's not a great thing to come back, there were no victory parades and that sort of thing.

04:44.320 --> 04:44.860
It's a great thing to come back to.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.740
Join us next time when we continue our interview with Joe Haldeman.

05:00.280 --> 05:05.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:05.000 --> 05:08.800
Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.940
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.240
And here are your hosts.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.100
This is David Carson and David Cruz.

06:34.580 --> 06:38.080
Today we'll be continuing our interview with author Joe Haldeman. It was mentioned in the

06:38.080 --> 06:42.640
previous program that Haldeman served in Vietnam and uses that experience in some of his stories.

06:43.340 --> 06:47.360
For instance, in one of his stories, he tells of a soldier who is severely hurt by a laser

06:47.360 --> 06:50.840
mine. We asked Haldeman if that was drawn from his own experiences.

06:51.940 --> 06:58.720
Well, I was wounded pretty severely in Vietnam. I was hospitalized for six months and it was

06:58.720 --> 07:04.380
a boog-o-trap. I didn't set it off, somebody else did, but it was a pretty big one. I had

07:04.380 --> 07:11.240
over 200 separate wounds, but managed to come out of it all right after a few months of

07:11.820 --> 07:19.140
physical therapy. So, yeah, I draw on that experience. The one you're talking about is

07:19.140 --> 07:25.460
a mind of his own. But I think I've got other short stories like the private war, private

07:25.460 --> 07:32.000
jaco, the draw on that memory. We wondered if he was exercising demons by writing about

07:32.000 --> 07:39.240
that experience. I don't know whether I am or not. I think I'm just using available material.

07:40.840 --> 07:45.500
I don't think the demon is too easily exercised by fiction.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.480
We asked if being in Vietnam had any other effects on his writing.

07:51.480 --> 08:00.320
Being in the army had an important effect on my writing, aside from war, because I met a whole new

08:00.320 --> 08:09.000
class of people. That is all of my friends while I was growing up tended to be white, middle

08:09.000 --> 08:15.460
class, upper middle class kids. There were successors, white, middle class, upper class

08:16.200 --> 08:24.300
scientists, so forth. It was just a mundane revelation to find that people who came from

08:24.300 --> 08:30.660
different backgrounds still had an awful lot in common with me. Most of the guys in my

08:30.660 --> 08:38.120
combat outfit were urban black high school or junior high school dropouts. They got along

08:38.120 --> 08:43.300
quite well. Haldeman has written two novels and edited one anthology, all dealing with

08:43.300 --> 08:47.980
war, but by no means should you consider him just a writer of war stories. That's right,

08:48.100 --> 08:51.780
he writes about what happens to people who are placed in that type of violent situation.

08:52.680 --> 08:57.100
He seems to be exploring what makes his characters tick more than the situations surrounding

08:57.100 --> 09:02.200
the characters. One of the themes in his work is man or mankind being changed when facing

09:02.200 --> 09:04.520
conflict. We ask Haldeman to respond to that.

09:05.720 --> 09:12.960
I think it's obvious that confronting death on a daily basis changes people, sometimes

09:12.960 --> 09:21.380
radically for the worse, and that people who are totally dehumanized by war. But speaking

09:21.380 --> 09:27.340
racially, I don't think you could make such a broad statement. What's behind some of the

09:27.340 --> 09:32.220
things I'm writing is the hope that human nature eventually may improve to the point

09:32.220 --> 09:37.820
where we won't have wars. We can find other ways to settle our differences.

09:39.280 --> 09:44.280
In his novel All My Sins Remembered, the main character is red-taped and shuffled into doing

09:44.280 --> 09:48.820
something that he is diametrically opposed to. When he rebels against the situation, he

09:48.820 --> 09:56.760
is terminated. The story is about a bureaucracy that totally takes over a man's identity,

09:57.100 --> 10:02.600
and he doesn't really exist except as a tool for that bureaucracy. When he becomes an

10:02.600 --> 10:08.160
efficient tool, he's scrapped. The main character ends up being a spy for the government and

10:08.160 --> 10:15.240
carrying out covert operations for them. And he does them more or less against his will,

10:15.240 --> 10:22.300
that is to say, through very advanced techniques of conditioning. He's turned into a thoroughly

10:22.300 --> 10:29.400
different person. He was a Buddhist, a pacifist when he started out. He did not get the job

10:29.400 --> 10:33.880
he signed up for. They twisted him around into being a killing machine.

10:35.440 --> 10:40.460
If all this makes Haldeman sound like a pessimist, well, he's not that either. Join us next time

10:40.460 --> 10:42.360
when we find out more about Joe Haldeman.

10:49.800 --> 10:55.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:55.280 --> 10:58.440
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:58.640 --> 12:04.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:07.140 --> 12:08.760
And here are your hosts.

12:13.660 --> 12:19.240
This is David Carson and David Cruz. Today we continue our interview with author Joe Haldeman.

12:19.880 --> 12:24.260
So far in our conversation with Haldeman, we've discussed how he used his experiences in Vietnam

12:24.260 --> 12:28.440
in his writing and some of his early works. Now we're going to look at his writing style

12:28.440 --> 12:33.580
in two particular stories. A short story to Howard Hughes' A Modest Proposal and a novel,

12:34.100 --> 12:39.380
Mindbridge. Haldeman tells these stories by using narratives by the main characters in the stories,

12:39.380 --> 12:44.480
reports by them and others, portions of books written long after the time set in the story

12:44.480 --> 12:49.860
and other non-standard writing techniques. We asked him if he got the ideas for this type of style

12:49.860 --> 12:52.060
when he was attending the Iowa Writers Conference.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.220
Oh, not really. The connection is with John Doe's process, actually.

12:58.660 --> 13:06.020
I read the U.S. H. Relate some years before at Mindbridge and really was impressed by the way it worked

13:06.020 --> 13:12.380
and thought it would work really well in science fiction. So I tried it out in a rather long short story

13:12.380 --> 13:20.420
to Howard Hughes' A Modest Proposal. And it looked like it would work, so I went ahead and applied it to Mindbridge.

13:22.160 --> 13:26.960
I did do most of that book while I was studying at Iowa, and that's why I had the dedication.

13:28.620 --> 13:32.740
The authors at the Iowa Writers Conference were, for the most part, not science fiction writers.

13:32.740 --> 13:36.180
We asked Haldeman about their reaction to his being a science fiction author.

13:37.220 --> 13:43.320
Well, they were a little apprehensive about it. See, they didn't know I was a science fiction writer when I joined the workshop.

13:44.220 --> 13:48.540
So I joined on the basis of my first novel, which was not science fiction.

13:49.700 --> 13:55.220
And some of them were outwardly hostile towards science fiction, such as Stanley Elkin.

13:55.220 --> 14:00.700
Others were anywhere between apprehensive and slightly sympathetic.

14:01.420 --> 14:07.140
Stephen Becker, one of them, had actually had a few pieces in the magazine Fantasy and Science Fiction.

14:08.220 --> 14:19.960
In general, though, they thinly disguised the attitude that the stuff was just commercial fiction, and therefore beneath contempt.

14:21.620 --> 14:26.020
That's an attitude I've never understood. Some of the world's finest literature is science fiction.

14:26.640 --> 14:29.140
We asked Haldeman what he thought about that type of attitude.

14:30.240 --> 14:38.840
But the field is judged by its worst, not by its best. And people like that think of science fiction.

14:39.020 --> 14:46.520
They think in terms of great D-movies and Lazy Television. They've never read much of the best of the field.

14:52.860 --> 14:57.060
Using science fiction is possible to consider various aspects of mankind's future.

14:57.700 --> 15:00.680
And science fiction is the only literary form to speculate about the future.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.740
We asked Haldeman if he thought that mankind might be radically different in the future.

15:06.040 --> 15:10.520
I think it's quite possible, even say within the span of a century,

15:10.520 --> 15:17.240
so many of the things that determine human nature are things that can be mitigated by technology.

15:19.080 --> 15:24.520
Such as the problem of dying so soon.

15:25.380 --> 15:35.540
That is, it's possible that in a couple of generations, a century, two centuries, maybe a thousand years, maybe as long as we care to,

15:35.540 --> 15:41.700
that will radically change human nature because it will take the pressure off of individuals.

15:44.800 --> 15:57.400
The other or other less sanguine notions is possible that sciences and communication will grow into a kind of sophisticated mind control.

15:58.840 --> 16:05.300
It will be difficult for the individual to know exactly what is his idea and what has been induced by his own society.

16:06.620 --> 16:11.480
Sort of a sophisticated life-long brainwashing doesn't seem too unlikely.

16:12.540 --> 16:14.400
And you can argue that it's happening now.

16:16.180 --> 16:21.700
Join us next time when we wrap up our interview with Joe Haldeman and find out how he got involved with Star Trek.

16:29.320 --> 16:34.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:34.980 --> 16:37.880
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:18.040 --> 17:21.940
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:37.760 --> 17:43.080
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.400
And here are your hosts.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.440
This is David Carson.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.020
And David Cruz. And today we're going to wrap up our interview with author Joe Haldeman.

17:58.860 --> 18:05.940
Haldeman has been involved in two multi-book series, one called Atar the Merman, and the other was Star Trek from the TV series.

18:06.440 --> 18:12.180
Although he enjoyed writing the first of his three Atar books, the ones that followed had nowhere to go to expand the characters.

18:12.900 --> 18:20.100
The publisher was banking on the current popularity of dolphins and whales, but the series never took hold and Haldeman's third book was never published.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.940
The Star Trek novels were a different sort of challenge, as Haldeman explains.

18:51.380 --> 18:51.820
Haldeman had to work out some other problems first.

18:52.060 --> 18:57.180
He was asked whether anybody was picking up Jim's work, and he said, why don't you give it a try.

18:57.700 --> 19:06.940
Jim was taking the scripts from the TV show and just turning them into short stories, whereas they wanted me to do what Jim would have done if he had lived,

19:07.120 --> 19:11.120
which was write original novels around the Star Trek characters.

19:12.640 --> 19:17.400
Writing these novels was more than just sitting down and coming up with something for Spock, McCoy, and Kirk to do.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.020
Haldeman had to work out some other problems first.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.800
One of Haldeman's latest projects is a trilogy, of which the first book, Worlds, is already out.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.160
Haldeman gave us a little background on that novel.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.900
It was born and grew up on a space colony, a space settlement.

20:21.680 --> 20:27.760
It is sent to Earth for a year of postgraduate work or finishing, if you want to call it that.

20:28.440 --> 20:38.060
Being set up for a political position as a liaison between this world and Earth, and various strange things happened to her in the year that she's here.

20:38.060 --> 20:44.120
It's sort of an old Yeldon Suramann kind of a novel.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.320
She grows by being sort of bounced around by Earth.

20:51.220 --> 20:59.680
And the second novel, Stars, takes over for the first one in and takes her into all age.

21:01.500 --> 21:06.820
It seems as if a lot of authors are writing trilogies these days, and we wondered why Haldeman decided to write one.

21:09.180 --> 21:13.560
Well, it seems like an awfully big thing to put into one book.

21:15.040 --> 21:23.480
And it looks as if each one of the trilogy, each volume of the trilogy will be longer than any other book that was written by us.

21:23.480 --> 21:30.840
At least a third, if you want so indeed, it would have been a book nearly a half million words long.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.980
So, right, they're difficult to sell.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.680
And I just, you know, everybody's doing trilogies, so I can't I do a trilogy too, it's part of it.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.880
They're very successful.

21:44.820 --> 21:47.980
The second and third books have a built-in audience.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.800
Also, I wanted to try something big.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.000
And that's as good a reason as any.

21:56.420 --> 22:00.680
We've discussed in the previous sections of this interview that Haldeman's main concern is storytelling.

22:01.420 --> 22:05.540
He develops interesting characters and sets them in a believable scientific background.

22:12.720 --> 22:21.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
