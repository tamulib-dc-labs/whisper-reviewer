00:01.360 --> 00:02.740
David, go ahead and start the tapes.

00:04.180 --> 00:05.060
Okay, we're rolling.

00:05.960 --> 00:09.900
First of all, I just wondered if you might tell us a little bit about how you, the origin

00:09.900 --> 00:11.400
of the column in Locust that you write.

00:12.820 --> 00:23.260
Well, about two and a half years ago, I was invited to address a group of authors, American

00:23.260 --> 00:25.220
Society of Journalists and Authors.

00:25.910 --> 00:34.220
And I chose to talk to them about certain contractual clauses that I thought might be

00:34.220 --> 00:36.180
pitfalls for most professional authors.

00:37.830 --> 00:44.500
In the questioning that followed, I found an appalling ignorance on the part of authors

00:45.670 --> 00:48.220
on the subject of contracts.

00:48.960 --> 00:55.140
And many of these people are highly respected professional journalists and book authors,

00:55.720 --> 01:00.780
and yet it was clear to me that they didn't know anything, or very much I should say,

01:01.200 --> 01:08.000
about how to read a contract, how to negotiate one, and how to alter a clause to their own

01:08.000 --> 01:08.500
benefit.

01:08.960 --> 01:15.360
And so I decided to write a column for the many other writers who probably are in the

01:15.360 --> 01:16.080
same position.

01:16.080 --> 01:23.180
And I asked Charles Brown, the editor of Locust, a publisher of Locust, I guess, whether he'd

01:23.180 --> 01:25.540
be interested in publishing it.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.640
And he was quite agreeable.

01:28.400 --> 01:36.980
And thereafter, a number of magazines, newsletters published by other writers groups such as

01:36.980 --> 01:44.500
Western Writers of America, Romance Writers of America, Mystery Writers of America, took

01:44.500 --> 01:47.960
on the column because they felt their authors were in the same position.

01:49.560 --> 01:53.420
So actually, Locust then was your first magazine of that type that you wrote the column for?

01:53.620 --> 01:53.840
Yes.

01:54.060 --> 01:58.220
Locust was, I still consider myself as writing the column for Locust.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.320
Okay, fine.

02:00.580 --> 02:06.120
Would you be allowed to tell me which science fiction authors or just some of them that

02:06.120 --> 02:06.820
you do represent?

02:07.480 --> 02:09.140
Well, no, I don't mind at all.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.580
It's, I think, a fairly common knowledge in the science fiction community.

02:14.220 --> 02:27.520
We represent Harlan Ellison, Gregory Benford, Greg Behr, Elizabeth Lin, Marta Randall, Barry

02:27.520 --> 02:37.220
Longhear, Warren Norwood, Jessica Sammonson, and I'd say three or four more.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.000
Okay.

02:41.400 --> 02:47.540
If you had to sell a decent manuscript by an unknown author, would you prefer to work

02:47.540 --> 02:51.720
with Romance, the Western, a mystery, a science fiction, or what sort of genre literature?

02:52.440 --> 02:57.980
Well, my orientation has always been the paperback original market.

02:58.900 --> 03:06.800
Not that my agency doesn't handle hard covers.

03:06.800 --> 03:12.220
Many have been on the bestseller list and book club selections and so forth.

03:12.940 --> 03:21.160
But the blood of the industry is the paperback market.

03:21.820 --> 03:26.920
The paperback market does break down into some fairly convenient genres.

03:28.040 --> 03:34.400
Agents, I guess, are a little bit like nomads in that they follow the source of life.

03:34.400 --> 03:41.800
And in this case, for instance, the hot market right now is contemporary romances.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.560
And so we have a very active department in contemporary romances.

03:47.920 --> 03:57.540
Science fiction has become somewhat soft since the Star Trek, Star Wars phenomenon.

03:58.480 --> 04:10.280
And although it's still a very active market, we have noticed a kind of sorting out of important writers

04:10.280 --> 04:13.280
from what they call the mid-list writers.

04:13.420 --> 04:23.280
That is to say those writers who aren't quite of the blockbuster bestseller category,

04:23.280 --> 04:30.380
and yet they're better than what some people might refer to as hacked writers.

04:30.940 --> 04:36.680
They find themselves in a market where there really isn't an audience anymore.

04:36.860 --> 04:46.600
So we have found that writers really have to choose between going to something else

04:46.600 --> 04:49.280
or becoming stars in the science fiction market.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.540
There's no middle ground anymore.

04:51.540 --> 04:55.580
And that's true of just about all the genres, westerns.

04:56.760 --> 05:05.380
Romance may be the place that is most open for new writers, inexperienced writers.

05:05.600 --> 05:10.900
But in the science fiction world, I think you must start with some advantage

05:10.900 --> 05:13.900
or you're going to have a tough struggle ahead of you.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.800
I think we've never spoken to an agent before.

05:19.380 --> 05:22.360
And from your perspective, I think you can answer certain questions

05:22.360 --> 05:24.800
that I think anybody else would have difficulty answering.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.030
And one of them I wanted to ask you is, from your perspective,

05:29.420 --> 05:32.900
what determines the popularity of a genre of literature in paperback?

05:33.380 --> 05:36.480
Is it the publishers who create the taste or what is what causes?

05:36.760 --> 05:39.860
It's hard to say. Sometimes the publishers create the taste,

05:40.280 --> 05:47.100
and sometimes the market, the consumer, creates the demand.

05:47.100 --> 05:53.300
And sometimes it's the agent. For instance, I find myself very often,

05:53.640 --> 05:57.460
in speaking to publishers, I find myself in a double role.

05:58.160 --> 06:03.100
I keep my ears open and try to listen to what a publisher tells me

06:03.100 --> 06:07.120
about what he's able to sell and what he's not able to sell.

06:07.600 --> 06:12.960
And so I have a kind of passive role in that I pass along to authors

06:12.960 --> 06:15.920
what the publishers tell me the market is doing.

06:15.920 --> 06:22.720
However, if I begin to notice a trend, I then try to help create a market

06:22.720 --> 06:27.940
by turning to other publishers and saying, listen, I've had lunch

06:27.940 --> 06:31.600
the last couple of months with four publishers, and they all tell me

06:31.600 --> 06:38.300
that hard science fiction is not as active as fantasy and source and sorcery,

06:38.640 --> 06:42.540
and so maybe you'd be interested in some sort of sorcery.

06:42.540 --> 06:48.380
So an agent is in the position of shaping the market once he begins to detect the trend.

06:51.460 --> 06:54.520
Okay, that was interesting. I guess after reading your columns, of course,

06:54.620 --> 06:56.980
I'm coming to understand how much influence an agent can have.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.500
I don't think I realized that before.

07:03.220 --> 07:06.940
Okay, I think I know the answer to this. In fact, most of the questions I'm asking you,

07:06.960 --> 07:09.640
I have some idea of what you'll say because of what I've read of your work,

07:09.640 --> 07:11.300
but still need to ask it.

07:12.940 --> 07:16.500
I know that you have different contracts for different clients or different authors,

07:16.760 --> 07:20.420
but to say a contract with any sort of author, not just science fiction,

07:20.520 --> 07:25.360
is it dependent upon if an author is new or established according to what kind of contract he gets?

07:26.100 --> 07:37.520
Well, I think authors and agents probably ought to try to penetrate through a lot of the haze

07:37.520 --> 07:44.800
that surrounds contractual negotiations and realize that the essential in a contractual negotiation

07:44.800 --> 07:46.000
is who has the power.

07:47.420 --> 07:56.360
For the beginning author, the first author or the author of some work from minor markets,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
the power definitely rests to the publisher.

07:59.580 --> 08:04.560
With the publisher, the publisher, the author in effect is saying to the publisher,

08:04.560 --> 08:08.760
I will sign anything you hand me if you publish me.

08:09.440 --> 08:15.020
And the publisher says, well, I'm glad to hear that because if you don't like our terms,

08:15.260 --> 08:17.280
we'll find somebody else to write for us.

08:17.640 --> 08:22.880
Now, obviously, the power in that equation lies with the publisher.

08:23.480 --> 08:28.140
However, as an author begins to develop, he has a following.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.840
His books begin to sell.

08:30.840 --> 08:35.500
The prices that he gets for his work begin to escalate.

08:36.180 --> 08:37.860
He may have a bestseller.

08:39.440 --> 08:44.100
He now has other publishers interested in publishing him.

08:44.520 --> 08:47.800
And now the equation is on the other foot, if I may make some metaphor.

08:48.600 --> 08:54.480
And it's now the author who says, the publisher says, I will do anything to keep you.

08:54.920 --> 08:59.660
And the author says, well, then you'd better meet my terms because there are plenty of publishers out there

09:00.480 --> 09:05.440
who will publish me if you don't like what I have, the terms that I'm ready to dictate.

09:06.180 --> 09:09.520
So when you get down to it, it's raw power.

09:10.040 --> 09:16.480
And the agent tries to put himself in those power vectors, I guess you would say,

09:16.680 --> 09:21.080
and get some sense of where they converge.

09:21.960 --> 09:27.220
And that's the point at which a contract materializes.

09:27.220 --> 09:34.600
The contract is a direct reflection of the power flow between the two parties.

09:35.060 --> 09:40.480
And at the point where they all interface, that is what a contract reads.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.080
That's excellent. Very good. You talk just like you write, I think.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.520
I'm not sure that's good or bad.

09:49.400 --> 09:57.420
Listen, science fiction fans are, I think, more fanatic than other types.

09:57.560 --> 10:02.580
And a lot of them, of course, are interested in writing and doing something besides just reading it.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.320
If somebody had reasonable amount of talent, what would you advise an aspiring science fiction author?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.100
Where should you begin?

10:08.440 --> 10:10.000
Always begin with the magazines.

10:11.960 --> 10:17.400
You're absolutely right about science fiction fans being more fanatic.

10:17.400 --> 10:26.920
But they are also fortunate in having a place where they can begin in the shorter media

10:27.920 --> 10:31.740
where most writers in other genres don't have the chance.

10:32.040 --> 10:36.800
I mean, there are very few places where a romance writer can contieve.

10:38.660 --> 10:45.640
You can't write romance short stories unless you try to write for some of the Slicker Women's magazines.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.280
And they're, of course, very demanding in what they accept.

10:51.080 --> 10:59.560
There used to be Western magazines, many, many of them, but almost all of them are gone now.

11:00.560 --> 11:10.280
Mystery magazines are still a couple of them, but it's not like what it used to be when I got into the business about 25 years ago.

11:10.280 --> 11:19.160
So one of the few remaining genres that invites new talent and cultivates it is science fiction,

11:19.280 --> 11:25.980
where you have very active magazine market and anthology market for original stories.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.140
You also have conventions.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.300
Of course, Western writers, romance writers, mystery writers also have their conventions.

11:34.300 --> 11:41.940
But certainly, science fiction writers can out-convention anybody by ratio of 10 to 1.

11:42.400 --> 11:49.600
So there's a lot of interplay where authors are always talking to one another,

11:50.100 --> 11:58.440
meeting editors, meeting professional writers, and there's a much tighter unity than there is in any other genre.

11:58.440 --> 12:07.380
So I would definitely advise any aspiring science fiction writer to start writing in the magazine.

12:07.720 --> 12:19.040
In fact, even some of my well-known clients, I still tell them to continue writing for science fiction magazines,

12:19.200 --> 12:25.680
even though they may get peanuts for their work compared to what they can get writing books,

12:25.680 --> 12:34.460
because the exposure among both science fiction editors and science fiction fans is terribly important.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.680
Okay, I just have about one or two more on science fiction.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.760
I'll get on to some more general things.

12:43.040 --> 12:50.180
Would you happen to be working with any unpublished authors at present in science fiction that we might look for?

12:52.300 --> 12:54.960
That question kind of catches me unaware.

12:56.200 --> 13:02.000
We have a number of people that we're, you know, we are establishing.

13:03.080 --> 13:09.800
It's very hard to say because in spite of what I said a few moments ago about getting published in magazines,

13:10.820 --> 13:16.740
like most other agents, we handle very little by way of short fiction.

13:16.740 --> 13:21.920
It's not profitable for an agent to handle science fiction stories,

13:23.480 --> 13:30.160
and there's very little that we can do for a short story writer that he or she can't do for him or herself.

13:31.320 --> 13:39.940
So by the time an author comes to us asking for representation, and we think that person might be interesting,

13:41.020 --> 13:50.620
he's probably had quite a number of stories published in the science fiction magazines.

13:50.780 --> 13:55.840
I will mention one, one author that I think is enormously talented,

13:56.500 --> 14:01.360
and will probably burst on the scenes within the next couple of years,

14:01.540 --> 14:08.300
and that's a writer named Dan Simmons who's beginning to make some appearances in Omni and some of the other magazines.

14:08.300 --> 14:16.200
He's a very, very talented writer, and we are about to take on some of his longer work.

14:18.780 --> 14:20.180
Okay, one more on...

14:20.180 --> 14:29.820
I should accord my thanks to Harlan Ellison who was the first person to spot him and refer him to me.

14:31.380 --> 14:34.360
Okay, good. One more on science fiction.

14:36.340 --> 14:46.080
Are you working on selling or do you have in your hands any big manuscripts from some of your name authors that might be published in the near future?

14:47.140 --> 14:56.460
Well, Gregory Benford has the author of Timescape, which was the Nebula Award winner in the novel Category for 1981,

14:58.100 --> 15:02.000
has two novels coming out in the next year.

15:02.000 --> 15:13.020
One is Against Infinity, which is coming out in April, will be published by Timescape Books and Hardcover, a wonderful novel.

15:13.680 --> 15:23.040
And I believe next February we will see in the ocean of, excuse me, Across the Sea of Suns,

15:23.660 --> 15:30.200
which is the sequel to In the Ocean of Night and is the second novel in a trilogy.

15:30.200 --> 15:44.780
We also have what I consider a great novel in the making by Richard Grant, who's made some appearances in magazines,

15:45.340 --> 15:54.100
but turned in a spectacular novel, which is now being shaped somewhat and redone.

15:54.100 --> 16:04.120
But it's some of the most brilliant writing I've ever read and those who have had an early look at it agree with me that it's a very impressive job.

16:04.620 --> 16:11.640
And I know that when that book is finished, I believe it's got bestseller written all over it.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.720
Okay, do you like trilogies?

16:16.780 --> 16:32.640
Yes, I like them and I encourage them. I feel they're a very comfortable form for science fiction writers, in fact, for non-science fiction writers as well.

16:36.420 --> 16:50.200
The beauty of a trilogy, of course, from an ancient viewpoint is in the kind of package deal that one can make where you not only sign an author up for a book,

16:50.280 --> 16:55.560
but you can sign him up for a sequel and a sequel after that.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.960
And the author knows where he's going to be two years from now.

17:00.020 --> 17:11.460
The publisher knows what he can expect over a couple of years, and unless the author one day runs out of steam or gets bored with characters that he developed in book one or two,

17:12.960 --> 17:21.980
you can see a cumulative effect in the sales of a trilogy where publication of book two makes people scurry for book one,

17:22.300 --> 17:32.840
and publication of book three causes the publisher to reissue books one and two, and then they put them in a box set and they're reviewed as a whole.

17:33.140 --> 17:38.700
It's a very nice way of publishing books, but not everybody has a sequel in them.

17:40.580 --> 17:44.740
Right. Why does an author with reasonable talent need an agent?

17:48.460 --> 18:02.140
There are very few authors who, once they achieve publication, are really able or even want to handle their own business

18:03.300 --> 18:08.600
until you become a full-blooded professional writer with a track record.

18:09.000 --> 18:19.480
As I said before, most of your job is writing your magazine stuff, sending it out, and developing a magazine market.

18:20.560 --> 18:26.440
But once you begin selling, unless you really understand contractual language,

18:29.880 --> 18:33.340
then you're going to need an agent to interpret it for you.

18:34.180 --> 18:42.300
Also, most authors are not as objective about their work as an agent can be,

18:42.700 --> 18:47.640
and therefore they either demand too much or too little when they negotiate a contract.

18:47.640 --> 18:55.640
So an agent can help put things in perspective and can talk both publishers and authors into being reasonable.

18:56.480 --> 19:03.400
Agents can also exploit subsidiary rights that authors are only dimly aware of,

19:03.900 --> 19:14.500
and agents finally are able to help build an author's career by spotting that author's strengths and weaknesses

19:14.500 --> 19:22.400
and building, of course, on the strengths and developing their talents to the utmost.

19:23.060 --> 19:31.720
There are few authors I know, most notably Isaac Asimov, who I don't believe has agents or at least not regular agents,

19:32.340 --> 19:38.660
and Isaac certainly has done okay for himself, although I think there are probably five dozen agents who have said to him,

19:38.660 --> 19:41.660
I don't think how well you would have done if you'd have an agent.

19:43.020 --> 19:53.260
But most authors sooner or later feel that it is well worth the commission and other things to have somebody,

19:53.920 --> 19:59.980
particularly when you don't live in the New York area, which is the heart of the publishing world.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.160
If you live in California or Nebraska or something like that,

20:05.100 --> 20:13.200
there's nothing so frightening as to be out of touch with a publisher and not having anybody that you can call to act on your behalf.

20:15.240 --> 20:21.680
Okay, a more personal question. Your book, How to Be Your Own Literary Agent, of course I haven't seen that yet,

20:21.760 --> 20:23.780
but are you trying to put yourself out of business with that?

20:24.280 --> 20:28.320
I don't think I will for the reasons that I just told you.

20:29.260 --> 20:44.460
The title may not be exactly accurate, because although it is designed to help new authors get a foot in the door that they might not otherwise have,

20:45.140 --> 20:56.460
it's also aimed at the professional author who may have an agent who may be of the kind who simply signs on the dotted line

20:56.460 --> 20:59.940
when his agent sticks a contract under his nose.

21:00.720 --> 21:08.280
And those authors, I think, are usually the ones who end up discovering a couple of years down the road

21:08.280 --> 21:11.100
that they made a horrible mistake when they signed that contract.

21:11.100 --> 21:16.160
And why didn't their agent tell them about certain things?

21:16.940 --> 21:27.560
And so my feeling is that an enlightened author is probably an agent's best friend, whether he's represented by an agent or not.

21:27.920 --> 21:38.280
The more than an author knows about contracts and related subjects, the tougher he's going to be in dealing with publishers,

21:38.900 --> 21:47.740
and the more he's going to benefit the entire fraternity and sorority of authors in this country and make an agent's job easier.

21:48.000 --> 21:56.260
So I don't feel that I've contradicted myself by publishing a book called How to Be Your Own Literary Agent.

21:58.180 --> 22:02.340
Okay, as the title indicates then, that really is a how-to book.

22:02.340 --> 22:17.480
Well, it does tell you, for instance, if you're a new author, it tells you what genres are the rightliest ones to buy your work,

22:18.120 --> 22:25.720
how to write for them, how to package your work for them, how to get your work on the desk of an editor,

22:26.260 --> 22:32.040
and avoid the so-called flush pile. It tells you what to do if you should get an offer.

22:33.320 --> 22:43.260
It tells you how to negotiate on your own. It tells you how to oversee what your agent is doing if you should decide to turn your work over to an agent.

22:43.420 --> 22:46.220
It tells you how to hire and fire an agent.

22:46.220 --> 23:02.980
And it completely analyzes publishing contracts from start to finish and interprets each clause in a way that any author can certainly get an advantage by studying my suggestions.

23:05.680 --> 23:10.380
So really, I guess even a beginner would get some good out of the book.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.000
Absolutely.

23:12.940 --> 23:14.680
Okay, good. And when will I be out again?

23:16.000 --> 23:24.680
Let's see. Today is the 15th, three days is the official publication date. February 18th.

23:25.260 --> 23:26.280
Okay, very good.

23:27.280 --> 23:46.000
It's already created something of a controversy in New York because one of the chapters in the book is a somewhat outspoken attack on publishing accounting systems.

23:47.900 --> 24:06.380
Publishers have a tendency to do what I call creative accounting, which the bottom line is that they hold hide or misguide authors as to how much in royalties they're entitled to.

24:06.380 --> 24:19.040
And a couple of days ago, the New York Times picked up on that chapter and published an article under the headline, Agent Says, Publishers are Cheating Authors.

24:19.660 --> 24:31.700
So we've got what I consider very healthy controversy going and certainly one that every author ought to be interested in because it really is the gut issue.

24:31.700 --> 24:43.620
I know many new authors and aspiring authors, all they want to know is who's going to publish my book and whatever they pay me, whatever advance I get is fine with me.

24:43.900 --> 25:00.260
But as they become more and more professional and experienced, they may wake up one day and realize that they're not getting everything that's owing to them because the publishers have obscured some of the royalty reporting systems

25:00.260 --> 25:07.360
that would enable an author to get his full due.

25:08.000 --> 25:24.960
And so I've tried to dispel some of the mystery around the reading of royalty statements so authors can get a better idea of what is being told to them and whether any money is being hidden.

25:27.700 --> 25:43.300
Okay, in reading your columns over a period of time, I think I've caught you saying a couple times that even with a lot of talent and even with a great manuscript, writers still may not make it because of the way the publishing industry is set up.

25:43.380 --> 25:45.640
Is that sort of a cynical attitude on your part?

25:45.640 --> 25:52.360
Well, I don't say it with any pride. I say it with a great deal of sadness.

25:53.820 --> 26:04.620
Many, in the last couple of years, the prices of books have gone prohibitively high.

26:05.420 --> 26:12.320
A hardcover novel these days sells for anywhere from $15 to $20.

26:13.140 --> 26:19.040
And a paperback novel sells anywhere from $3 to $5 or even a little more.

26:21.060 --> 26:34.460
And the consumer, the book buyer, is shying away from the marketplace now because he seems to feel there are better ways to spend $20 or $5 even.

26:35.300 --> 26:45.200
As a result, the book sales have been dropping and the publishers have become more and more selective as to what they buy.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.700
Unfortunately, that all gets passed down to the author.

26:52.280 --> 27:02.240
And more and more frequently in the last couple of years, I have had to turn away, as all my colleagues in the agency business have had to do.

27:03.160 --> 27:17.960
I've had to turn away a number of very good books that were well written but didn't really fit into certain categories that I know are actively buying.

27:18.840 --> 27:24.060
And so what you end up with is a well-written book that really isn't saleable.

27:25.440 --> 27:31.760
And it can often break your heart to send a book like that back.

27:32.200 --> 27:36.820
It doesn't hurt you as much to send back a bad book as it does to send back a good one.

27:37.280 --> 27:41.340
But there's nothing guaranteeing that a good book is going to sell.

27:41.560 --> 27:48.180
And that, I would say, is possibly the major difference between publishing today and publishing ten years ago.

27:50.220 --> 27:52.020
Okay, one more follow-up on that.

27:52.460 --> 27:58.980
Does the system, as you described, lead to sort of hack writing or writing that's not very good?

27:59.740 --> 28:10.480
No, quite the contrary. I think the level of writing is getting better because publishers don't need to publish hack writing anymore when they can get so many good writers.

28:10.480 --> 28:26.660
The market has shrunk. For instance, in the paperback field, whereas about two or three years ago there were, I would say, 13 active viable paperbacks ranging from the modified ones to the giant.

28:27.900 --> 28:34.140
Several have gone out of business and three or four more have been absorbed into other companies.

28:34.140 --> 28:39.920
And now one can count six or seven paperback publishers left.

28:40.880 --> 28:46.860
And so the clamor to be published by those houses is increasing.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.960
And so the publishers can afford to be more selective than ever before.

28:51.640 --> 29:03.300
So my feeling is that the, although I don't like to use the word hack, that certainly the inferior writer is either going to have to try harder or he's going to drop out

29:03.300 --> 29:06.800
because there are just too many good writers waiting to take his place.

29:09.260 --> 29:14.080
Okay, Mr. Curtis, I have about, I want to move, I have about 10 minutes left if you can spare that.

29:14.100 --> 29:18.480
I wanted to talk about some personal things about your background and your own work if you have the time for that.

29:18.620 --> 29:19.020
Absolutely.

29:20.200 --> 29:26.040
Okay, I was going to say how does one become an agent, but I guess I better ask how you became one.

29:26.040 --> 29:38.680
Well, when I think for a long time I always wanted to be a writer and when I got out of college, I discovered that there were no real jobs for writers.

29:38.980 --> 29:42.540
So I decided to get into a related field publishing.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.140
Could not find a job at a publishing company.

29:46.540 --> 29:53.420
So I finally ended up working for a leading literary agency, Scott Merida.

29:54.340 --> 29:58.960
And there I stayed for some seven or eight years and that was my apprenticeship.

30:00.440 --> 30:07.140
And after some seven years, I really did have an itch to write.

30:07.960 --> 30:12.700
And so I had been writing even while I worked for Scott Merida.

30:12.700 --> 30:17.580
So I left that firm and became a freelance writer.

30:17.740 --> 30:23.900
And of course, having been an agent, I was much better connected than most freelance writers could ever hope to be.

30:24.520 --> 30:30.800
So the transition was not as hard for me as it would be if somebody left some other job.

30:32.680 --> 30:41.460
I did a lot of magazine work, but eventually realized that the magazine market was in its twilight.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.400
And began focusing on books.

30:45.020 --> 30:55.080
I wrote a lot of paperback novels and then eventually got into such areas as collaboration, books on conservation.

30:56.260 --> 31:02.640
I found that I had Forte in the area of humor, so I did a number of satirical books.

31:03.580 --> 31:08.840
I wrote just about anything that people would pay money for and it was a very, very good grounding.

31:10.100 --> 31:17.980
And after about five years of that, a number of my old clients looked me up and asked me if I would represent them.

31:18.580 --> 31:25.840
And since I was not making a fortune as a writer in spite of the fact that to date I've had about 45 books published,

31:26.780 --> 31:32.440
I decided that perhaps I would go back into agenting and I started my own firm.

31:32.440 --> 31:38.800
And for two or three years I was both a writer and a literary agent.

31:39.300 --> 31:44.480
And literally I had two desks back to back with a swivel chair between them.

31:44.920 --> 31:51.460
And in the morning I would do one thing and in the afternoon I would do another and I would try not to let one contaminate the other.

31:52.180 --> 31:58.860
And eventually when I discovered that I could make more money on a few phone calls as an agent,

31:58.860 --> 32:01.900
then I could for four or five months writing books.

32:01.980 --> 32:05.920
It was pretty clear to me where my career was heading.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.520
But I have not given up my writing.

32:10.400 --> 32:19.240
The column, of course, is very satisfying and from time to time I might take a crack at a commercial novel or a non-fiction book.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.420
I get up at five or six in the morning.

32:22.960 --> 32:25.960
I'll write for an hour or so and then I'll go to work.

32:25.960 --> 32:32.800
And although an hour a day may not seem like a lot, as most professional writers will tell you,

32:33.680 --> 32:42.420
over a period of a couple of months one can write a book at an hour a day as long as you stay with it and turn out something every day.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.580
So I do consider myself a literary agent with a side order of writing.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.560
In looking over the books that I know you've written in the past few years,

32:55.680 --> 33:02.160
it seems to me that a lot of your non-fiction books have been dealing with issues of social concern like the nuclear lessons,

33:02.360 --> 33:04.400
the inequality of American communities and so forth.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.820
Is that because of personal taste or because of your collaborator?

33:07.820 --> 33:17.580
Well, I take some pride in some of the work that I've done in the area of conservation.

33:20.200 --> 33:32.500
Around 1970 or so I was approached by a woman who had accumulated a great deal of quite terrifying information about the nuclear power industry.

33:32.500 --> 33:40.000
And she asked me to collaborate with her. I knew very little about it, but I did work with her.

33:41.020 --> 33:47.920
And out of that collaboration came a book that was published by Doubleday called Perils of the Peaceful Atom.

33:48.520 --> 33:55.620
It was the first popular book on the dangers of nuclear power plants.

33:55.620 --> 34:06.660
And although it was supplanted later on by books published by people, authorities, scientists and PhDs,

34:06.700 --> 34:20.180
whereas we were only laymen and women, I like to think that that book did open the door to discussion of the nuclear power issues,

34:20.180 --> 34:25.600
which finally culminated in the Three Mile Island accident years later.

34:26.440 --> 34:35.380
And I was able to say that I had told you so. Many of the things that happened were predicted in that book years earlier,

34:35.800 --> 34:37.800
and of course nobody really wanted to listen.

34:39.700 --> 34:46.120
So I have written some other books of social value and I'm very proud of them.

34:46.120 --> 35:03.320
I'm also, if I may add, very proud as an agent to have brought into the world many books on social issues and things like that.

35:03.380 --> 35:10.220
We recently handled a magnificent first novel about the Vietnam War called The Thirteenth Valley,

35:10.220 --> 35:20.520
which went on the bestseller list and opened the door to what I know will now be a state of Vietnam fiction.

35:21.340 --> 35:25.740
Up until that time, people had said that nobody really wanted to read about Vietnam.

35:26.380 --> 35:34.140
And so we've now enabled some fresh air to blow into the marketplace with that novel.

35:34.580 --> 35:38.220
And again, this is an accomplishment that I'm very proud of.

35:43.000 --> 35:48.940
What about your fiction, your novels? Could you give me an idea of what kind of things you write about if they sell well?

35:49.380 --> 35:56.280
Well, a couple years ago, while I was still full, well more than that, about a decade ago,

35:59.840 --> 36:08.340
I conceived a paperback series featuring a hero that I always thought was rather unusual.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.840
He was a detective in the area of sports.

36:13.700 --> 36:24.600
And a series of books featuring this hero was, the series was called The Pro, and the books were published by Warner.

36:24.600 --> 36:33.920
We did four of those, and at the moment I'm trying to revive that series or something along those lines,

36:33.940 --> 36:40.760
because right now, although there's a great deal of male action-adventure fiction being published,

36:41.900 --> 36:50.920
everybody's getting bored with the same old heroes, the mercenaries, the dirty dozens, and series like that.

36:52.060 --> 36:58.120
So I'm trying to get revived, this hero that I think is a rather refreshing one.

36:58.680 --> 37:03.720
But I'm not able to do too much in the fiction area simply because of time.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.320
Okay, I just have a couple more here.

37:09.340 --> 37:15.420
I remember reading one of your columns where you mentioned, I guess it was an innovation on your part as an agent,

37:15.540 --> 37:19.820
where you contracted with a publicity firm for your clients and so forth.

37:19.820 --> 37:27.760
I wondered if you've, things like that that you've done for your clients, it might be a little different or innovative or whatever.

37:28.560 --> 37:39.960
Well, every agent, of course, is trying to seek a better way to handle his clients and more advantages for his clients.

37:39.960 --> 37:56.760
And one of the things that upsets me deeply is the fact that publishers are very reluctant to spend promotional money on any authors except the big name celebrity authors.

37:57.580 --> 38:11.800
And so I attempted a couple of years ago to rectify that by asking my clients in effect to chip in.

38:12.380 --> 38:18.860
Each one of them would be, in effect, taxed a couple of extra percentage points of commission.

38:19.680 --> 38:29.840
And that tax would go towards a fund which we used to hire a publicity agent who would publicize the little guy.

38:30.420 --> 38:39.820
And some of the campaigns were quite successful. Some aspects of the campaign were not so successful.

38:40.360 --> 38:46.400
And it was because of the inconsistency of the results that we finally dropped the program.

38:46.400 --> 38:54.940
But some of it has had lasting results and certainly created a lot of talk in the industry and among authors.

38:56.160 --> 39:03.800
And it was, I thought, a noble experiment in the area of getting the lesser-known authors publicized.

39:03.800 --> 39:19.520
But it's still difficult. The market inclines towards the big name and the struggle to become a big name is extremely intense and very, very few people emerge.

39:23.180 --> 39:31.020
Okay. What about movie deals for books that are worthy of it? Do you actively seek the matter? Do movie houses come to you?

39:31.020 --> 39:55.940
Well, it's a combination. Most books that are published, that are of any value at all, are covered by the movie studios, producers, and the people in New York whose job it is to scout on behalf of various Hollywood interests.

39:55.940 --> 40:11.700
So the chances are that if you have any, if an agent is handling a good book at all, it will have been seen in one way or another by producers, directors, studio people, and so forth.

40:11.840 --> 40:18.760
They have amazing ways of getting hold of manuscripts no matter how secretive you try to be.

40:18.760 --> 40:24.440
And so long before you're ready to show them, they've already been exposed.

40:26.180 --> 40:37.340
Nevertheless, if we get a hot manuscript and we really think it's going to make a terrific book, we actively try to find a movie producer for it.

40:37.980 --> 40:41.620
And so sometimes the deals come to us and sometimes we generate them.

40:44.740 --> 40:52.060
Okay. That's about, I mean, there's lots of questions. I could keep on talking for a long time, but I think we have enough and we've taken enough of your time.

40:52.580 --> 41:02.600
But listen, is there anything I haven't asked that you think listeners should know or anything at all that you'd like to talk about while we still have some tape left?

41:05.560 --> 41:10.360
No, we're happy to answer any, you know, any other questions you may have.

41:11.260 --> 41:16.140
I will say that we were talking about innovations before.

41:17.000 --> 41:29.960
I may be springing a very radical proposition on the publishing industry that I believe will create a lot of talk and controversy, and I'm not doing it just to publicize myself.

41:29.960 --> 41:45.560
But I've begun to, because of my deep concern about royalty accounting and how publishers have managed to manipulate and hide author's royalties,

41:46.100 --> 41:57.340
I'm going to be making a proposal to the publishing industry about a radically different way of accounting royalties based not on sales but on copies printed.

41:57.340 --> 42:18.660
And I would say that within the next few months you might begin looking for some stirring in that area, and I believe it could have some rather radical effects on the way people think about the traditional way of accounting royalties.

42:20.200 --> 42:26.680
I remember some of your columns, I think you sort of hinted at certain things about the way the publishers did that.

42:27.020 --> 42:41.680
Right. Well, I actually do suggest something like it in my book, but I will now be amplifying on it, and if I can get some of the publishing media to pick up on these suggestions,

42:41.680 --> 42:49.660
it should make for a very, very lively dialogue and certainly one that's well overdue in this 18th century business we call publishing.

42:51.180 --> 42:58.960
Well, I take it then in the, let's say the three-part relationship here, a writer, an agent and a publisher, that you would say probably the publisher has much the best of it?

42:58.960 --> 43:17.380
No, I don't think so at all. I've heard everybody accuse everybody else of having the best of it. There are rich agents, there are agents who are struggling, there are rich authors and authors who are struggling, and there are rich publishers and there are publishers who are struggling.

43:19.360 --> 43:40.600
I, in spite of some of the belligerent things I may have said, I have a great, great many friends among the publishers and I want to see them do well, and so I've come to think of it as a symbiotic environment in which everybody really does depend on everybody else.

43:41.820 --> 44:08.000
And an agent's job is not just to negotiate contracts, but to negotiate interests so that nobody gets so badly hurt that he can't carry on. I mean, publishers have, are always complaining about their overhead and it's well to remind them that agents have to pay their rent also,

44:08.000 --> 44:30.920
but some agents get very greedy and they feel that the only way for an author to become famous is to pin the publisher to the wall with a cruel deal and sometimes they can backfire in terms of how much money is left after you've hit a publisher that hard,

44:30.920 --> 44:51.240
how much money is left for the struggling author. The paperback publisher that consistently pays two or three million dollars for one or two authors is going to find himself neglecting the new author because he can't afford to pay him

44:51.240 --> 45:11.340
or if he should buy in the author's work he won't have any money left to publicize or promote that author's book. So there's something even to be said for not being greedy on behalf of your authors and giving the publisher an even break.

45:14.220 --> 45:17.700
Okay, very good. Okay, listen, we're going to turn off the recorder.
