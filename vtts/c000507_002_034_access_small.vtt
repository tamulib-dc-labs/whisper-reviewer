Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.360
And here are your hosts.

00:44.780 --> 00:47.460
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

00:47.860 --> 00:52.100
Philip Jose Farmer has been a mainstay science fiction writer since 1952.

00:52.700 --> 00:57.520
He has written over 40 novels and over 80 short stories focusing on a wide variety of subjects.

00:58.060 --> 01:03.680
These range from Tarzan to the afterlife, from sex-crazed aliens to a star-faring Catholic

01:03.680 --> 01:08.680
priest. Farmer's most famous works are the River World series, The World of Tears series,

01:09.060 --> 01:14.500
his erotic fantasy novels, and the story later a novel The Lovers. We ask Farmer how he started

01:14.500 --> 01:20.140
writing science fiction. I started reading science fiction when I was seven years old.

01:20.140 --> 01:26.760
I'm 63 now, and I knew I always wanted to be a writer.

01:27.540 --> 01:34.860
All I did was do much about it for many years. The funny thing is I actually intended to become

01:34.860 --> 01:42.200
a mainstream writer, that is to write stories which are not in particular genre. But I somehow

01:42.200 --> 01:48.800
just drifted into science fiction and sold my first science fiction story in 1952.

01:49.940 --> 01:57.860
That was called The Lovers. It was a novel novel that was published in a magazine, and it's generally

01:57.860 --> 02:04.640
credited with breaking the taboo against the mature use of sex in science fiction magazines.

02:05.940 --> 02:10.340
We asked Farmer if he consciously set out to break taboos by writing The Lovers.

02:11.740 --> 02:17.900
No, I had an idea for a story, and I couldn't write it unless I broke the taboo. I didn't

02:17.900 --> 02:24.320
really consciously set out to do it because I had the idea, and I thought it was terrific.

02:24.620 --> 02:28.660
On the other hand, I knew I was going to have a lot of trouble getting an accepted idea.

02:29.140 --> 02:37.400
I did have a lot of trouble. The first editor I sent it to, John Campbell, the editor of The

02:39.500 --> 02:43.980
Lovers, was the most prestigious and highest paying market, and actually I sent it to him first.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.800
He returned it with a comment that I'm not sure you're reading.

02:49.600 --> 02:56.160
So I sent it to Horace Gold, who was editing Galaxy, which was equally prestigious and had

02:56.680 --> 03:04.380
about the same word rate. His comments were something like John Campbell's. Then I sent it to

03:05.040 --> 03:09.720
Samuel Mines, who was editor of a magazine called Starling Stories.

03:12.500 --> 03:18.880
He immediately accepted it and knew it was a revolutionary breakthrough. He published it,

03:18.980 --> 03:26.980
and I was on my way. Accepted the next story I wrote was also equally revolutionary, and

03:27.640 --> 03:31.540
it took me a year before I could get anybody to accept it.

03:33.820 --> 03:38.360
Farmer is also interested in religion and its varied forms, and has used it in his works.

03:39.520 --> 03:46.360
My interest in religion has manifested itself throughout all my work. Although a lot of people,

03:46.560 --> 03:52.720
when they say the name Farmer, immediately think of sex in both. Fact is I've written much more

03:52.720 --> 04:01.080
about religion than about sex, or sometimes both at the same time. In some respects,

04:02.620 --> 04:10.160
sex and religion are two sides of the same coin. In certain fields of activity.

04:15.700 --> 04:21.060
But religion is only one of many themes. Farmer feels that he may have labored in relative anonymity

04:21.060 --> 04:24.700
for years because his writings are so varied, but he has his reasons.

04:25.520 --> 04:32.740
One of the reasons I've had trouble in the early days, I think really becoming identified and

04:32.740 --> 04:40.720
getting a ban of followers is that I didn't beat on just one or two drums. I ranged all over the

04:40.720 --> 04:50.340
field. But I find out that if I do a variety of stuff and I don't get tired, each new novel

04:50.860 --> 04:53.420
challenge, I'm not just working the same old theme again.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.560
Tomorrow we continue with more on Philip Jose Farmer.

05:05.020 --> 05:09.820
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:09.820 --> 05:13.680
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:20.340 --> 05:50.180
Thank you.

05:57.700 --> 06:01.700
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:16.800 --> 06:22.140
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.500
And here are your hosts.

06:31.700 --> 06:36.520
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz. We're continuing our interview with Philip Jose Farmer.

06:36.980 --> 06:41.300
We want to explore here some background related to one of Farmer's major themes, religion.

06:42.080 --> 06:46.700
As Farmer allowed earlier, he considers himself a writer of religious themes even more so than a

06:46.700 --> 06:50.400
writer of sexual themes. His own religious background is quite checkered.

07:02.320 --> 07:08.540
And I always wrestled all my life with the problems of immortality,

07:09.100 --> 07:15.420
pre-bestion, grace, the afterlife, and all that sort of stuff. I was raised as a

07:17.040 --> 07:25.940
Christian scientist up until the time I was about 12, and then I was sent to a Presbyterian church

07:28.620 --> 07:35.300
where there was a conflict between Christian science and the Presbyterian idea of predestination.

07:36.880 --> 07:41.880
And then when I was about 16, I guess I became an atheist. Now I've gone through

07:43.900 --> 07:48.920
atheism, through agnosticism, and then I was converted to the disciples of Christ.

07:50.060 --> 07:57.140
And then I backslid, fell from grace, and as the theological term goes,

07:58.220 --> 08:03.480
and then I lapsed back into agnosticism. And what are Farmer's present beliefs?

08:04.700 --> 08:12.820
My present situation is that without immortality, life has no meaning. If there's a creation,

08:12.820 --> 08:21.020
there must be a creator. But I've become tremendously interested in what to sometimes

08:21.020 --> 08:31.280
refer to as mythism. It isn't really like the Muslims, the Muslims' Sufism school. Then

08:32.540 --> 08:40.320
a lot of related stuff like that. You might see right now, I'm in a sort of a limbo,

08:41.280 --> 08:46.460
heading towards something I don't know what. The concept of an afterlife appears repeatedly in

08:46.460 --> 08:52.180
Farmer's works. Well, if you think about it, there could be a million different possibilities

08:52.180 --> 09:02.300
in an afterlife of their work. But one of my perhaps unstated themes is that immortality

09:03.120 --> 09:10.300
may not depend upon a supernatural being that's in the evolutionary drives of man,

09:10.320 --> 09:19.820
for him to invent immortality himself. Drawback to that is, those people who are already dead

09:19.820 --> 09:26.220
will remain dead, right? So that doesn't correspond to the religious idea of immortality,

09:26.300 --> 09:32.580
where everybody is raised from the first human being to the last one.

09:34.040 --> 09:40.780
I like to do a lot of variations on that. I have a new book called The Unreasoning Mask.

09:41.160 --> 09:47.960
That's the quotation we'll be dick. And this is concerned with theology,

09:48.680 --> 09:56.340
of afterlife, immortality. You might call it a philosophical theological space offer.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.380
So,

10:13.380 --> 10:18.480
many of Farmer's first works had the central theme of religion. The lovers and a woman a day

10:18.480 --> 10:23.540
deal with a future amalgamation of church and state called the Sturge. A popular character,

10:23.540 --> 10:28.580
Father John Carmody, is a planet hopping Catholic priest who has appeared in several short stories.

10:29.140 --> 10:33.260
We learn about his former life and conversion in the excellent novel Night of Light.

10:34.180 --> 10:39.040
Inside, Outside is a wild tale about the afterlife and immortality. It is in fact the

10:39.040 --> 10:43.340
predecessor to the famous Riverworld series, which we will discuss in our next show.

10:49.980 --> 10:55.360
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

10:55.360 --> 10:59.220
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:44.460 --> 11:48.640
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:04.020 --> 12:09.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.700
And here are your hosts.

12:18.440 --> 12:24.000
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz. Having looked into Philip Hosey Farmer's feelings on religion

12:24.000 --> 12:30.100
and immortality, we began a look today at the Riverworld series. Farmer explains the basis of the story.

12:30.900 --> 12:37.820
It concerns a planet in which there's a 10 million mile long river which follows the valley.

12:38.600 --> 12:47.500
And everybody has lived from about 150,000 D.C. to about 1883 A.D. was resurrected along

12:47.500 --> 12:56.060
the Bangsley River and rejuvenated for them, looks like they were 25. And the main mystery behind

12:56.060 --> 13:05.880
the whole thing was why were all these people resurrected? Who did it and how?

13:06.920 --> 13:11.860
But the Riverworld concept is so big that Farmer has managed only to scratch the surface in the

13:11.860 --> 13:19.180
four main novels of the series. There are so many themes that I wanted to explore during the course

13:19.180 --> 13:25.440
of those four novels, but I couldn't do it because I would have slowed the story down too much.

13:26.500 --> 13:32.260
It wasn't taking too many sidetracks, you might say, and I'd still be working on that particular

13:32.260 --> 13:37.980
series. What else is left? Listen to Farmer as he gives us an inkling of what he would like to cover.

13:39.080 --> 13:45.620
I didn't go into any detail in how you work out viable societies with people from every place

13:46.190 --> 13:57.560
every time. I also wanted to bring up in depth what would happen to famous people on that planet.

13:58.800 --> 14:05.560
Well, there's Carl Marx, for instance. What would he think of what happened to his

14:06.290 --> 14:13.260
ideas about communism on the planet Earth after he died? Leonardo da Vinci,

14:13.880 --> 14:21.080
his ideas about art, what's the fact that he's on a planet where there are very few pigments

14:21.080 --> 14:25.180
available, for instance, for him to paint? What would he do there?

14:28.220 --> 14:29.470
I also wanted to

14:32.280 --> 14:37.660
bring up various figures from science and the military and philosophy and so forth,

14:38.480 --> 14:42.640
show what they would do there. Now, one of the things about the river world was that

14:44.480 --> 14:50.980
although you were resurrected there in a useful body of your own, as it was in 25 or earlier,

14:51.180 --> 14:59.660
you died before 25. If, for instance, you were 83 when you died and when your mind is still 83,

14:59.660 --> 15:08.780
you have 83 years of experience on Earth behind you. Now, is your character formed? Are you going

15:08.780 --> 15:15.780
to go through perhaps a thousand years being the same person or are you going to improve?

15:16.380 --> 15:19.480
And is the magic labyrinth the last word on the river world?

15:20.300 --> 15:27.460
I made a lot of people mad at me because of that last sentence or your paragraph.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.680
I wrote in the magic labyrinth, everything seems to have been settled,

15:33.700 --> 15:41.620
everything has been cleared up, and then one of the characters, the town of Latterman,

15:42.300 --> 15:49.380
Peter J. Striggett, he's celebrating with the others in the misty tar when he thinks he hears

15:49.380 --> 15:55.480
a football outside in the hallway, blows out, comes back, and says to the others,

15:56.100 --> 16:00.340
I didn't see anyone, it must have been my imagination. A lot of readers got mad at me

16:00.340 --> 16:04.720
because they thought, oh no, he's going right another one. He's leaving a loophole. Well,

16:04.780 --> 16:11.080
I am leaving a loophole. I don't know whether I'll go through it or not, but it's quite possible that

16:11.080 --> 16:18.640
the magic labyrinth wasn't the final one in that series before that everything that

16:19.760 --> 16:23.960
our protagonist learned and everybody else learned is

16:25.080 --> 16:30.760
clearly on through or half-streamed. So the river world novels may or may not be finished,

16:31.160 --> 16:35.380
but we do have some more side stream stories to anticipate, more on Farmer tomorrow.

16:42.860 --> 16:47.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:47.660 --> 16:51.500
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.380
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:56.980 --> 18:02.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.660
And here are your hosts.

18:11.640 --> 18:16.700
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz. Our show today continues the discussion with Philip

18:16.700 --> 18:21.620
Jose Farmer. A major incident in Farmer's career began when Venus on the half-shell,

18:21.800 --> 18:25.920
a novel written under the pseudonym Kilgore Trout, appeared in the pages of fantasy and

18:25.920 --> 18:31.500
science fiction in late 74, early 75. Of course, Kilgore Trout is the creation of author Kurt

18:31.500 --> 18:36.660
Vonnegut Jr. The character Trout is an impoverished, underappreciated science fiction writer who

18:36.660 --> 18:41.340
appears in a number of Vonnegut's novels. We asked Farmer if he identifies with Kilgore Trout.

19:25.380 --> 19:30.540
Vonnegut did not appreciate the reviews given Venus on the half-shell, either pro or con,

19:30.800 --> 19:34.240
because most of the reviewers approached the work as if Vonnegut were the author.

19:34.240 --> 19:39.020
This cost Farmer the opportunity to write another novel under the Kilgore Trout pseudonym.

20:04.720 --> 20:09.800
When I applied for permission to write The Sun of Jimmy Valentine, which I really would have loved,

20:10.480 --> 20:16.720
I could have had a lot of fun with it, he said no, which is his prerogative.

20:18.500 --> 20:22.420
We asked if The Sun of Jimmy Valentine was Kilgore Trout's one erotic novel.

20:23.920 --> 20:32.040
It was not only his one and only specifically erotic book, it was also his only non-science fiction book.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.820
Farmer obviously enjoys writing about fictional authors who in turn write about their own fictional

20:37.820 --> 20:42.540
authors and so on. Listen as he describes what writing as Kilgore Trout started.

20:43.360 --> 20:51.640
In the Venus on the half-shell, the protagonist, Simon Lagstaff, had his favorite science fiction

20:51.640 --> 20:59.580
author. Just as in Vonnegut's books, Elliot Rosewater thought that Kilgore Trout was the greatest

21:00.140 --> 21:04.540
living writer in any field. He should have been president of the US and couldn't have solved

21:04.540 --> 21:10.980
all the problems. Well anyway, in Venus on the half-shell, Simon Lagstaff liked to read the

21:10.980 --> 21:19.980
science fiction works of a fellow called Jonathan Swiss Summers the Third, and I describe his various

21:19.980 --> 21:27.000
works, their album, his entitled. But Jonathan Swiss Summers, who's a fictional author,

21:28.500 --> 21:34.960
wrote about a giant German shepherd police dog whose IQ had been raised to about 200

21:34.960 --> 21:42.560
in a laboratory and became a private detective. Now I plan eventually someday on writing a book

21:42.560 --> 21:52.660
by Ralph von Baubau, this dog under the name of Ralph von Baubau. And then maybe I'll end the

21:52.660 --> 21:59.880
cycle by having Ralph von Baubau write about a human named Vonnegut, something like that,

22:00.620 --> 22:03.240
and completing it, going right back to Vonnegut again.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.960
Farmer conceded with the extended family group called the Vold Newton family, in which many

22:08.960 --> 22:13.800
great historical and fictional characters are descended from the scarlet Pimpernel. Thus Kilgore

22:13.800 --> 22:20.100
Trout is related to Sherlock Holmes, Doc Savage, Sam Spade, and James Bond, among others. We will

22:20.100 --> 22:31.880
look into this aspect of Farmer's writing some more tomorrow. This has been the Science Fiction

22:31.880 --> 22:36.740
Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction

22:36.740 --> 22:38.900
with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:25.700 --> 23:29.620
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:45.160 --> 23:50.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:53.180 --> 23:54.840
And here are your hosts.

23:59.560 --> 24:04.960
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz. This show will conclude our interview with Philip Jose

24:04.960 --> 24:09.080
Farmer. Yesterday we discussed Farmer's pension for writing under pseudonyms,

24:09.440 --> 24:12.440
as it turns out this practice has a very desirable side effect.

24:13.560 --> 24:20.040
One of the funny things about this is that I found out that I could use the fictional

24:20.040 --> 24:26.300
author device to break a writing block. I had a writing block once, that terrible thing that

24:26.300 --> 24:32.840
sometimes happens to writers, or they don't know what caused this for some reason.

24:33.300 --> 24:37.500
They might have many ideas, be eager to go, but when they sit down in front of the typewriter

24:37.500 --> 24:45.000
nothing happens. Well, that happened to me once. I never thought it would, I thought I was immune

24:45.000 --> 24:52.340
to such a thing. But it did, and after wrestling for two months and getting no place, I had an idea.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.820
I sat down with the typewriter and wrote a story,

24:58.540 --> 25:05.560
not by Philip Jose Farmer, but by David Copperfield, I'd say. I don't remember which

25:05.560 --> 25:14.740
particular nom, the story might be. The story poured out, very good, I thought so anyway.

25:16.200 --> 25:21.920
When I'd completed that, the writing block was gone. See, I wasn't writing then as me,

25:22.920 --> 25:29.920
Philip Jose Farmer, but as I say, Gilbert Trout. And I was in his shoes, I had no trouble. Now,

25:30.020 --> 25:37.500
the funny thing about this is that it's a psychological trick that I'm conscious of,

25:40.220 --> 25:47.860
and yet it works. It's not like I'm trying to trick my unconscious, but I must be doing it one way or

25:48.420 --> 25:55.520
another. Well, I don't know if anybody else has ever broken this writer's block in that manner,

25:55.760 --> 26:02.460
but I recommend trying it. Farmer has also written several books featuring Tarzan or Tarzan-like

26:02.460 --> 26:08.900
characters. Tarzan Alive is Tarzan's biography. The erotic novel A Feast Unknown and its clean

26:08.900 --> 26:14.340
sequels The Mad Goblin and Lord of the Trees feature thinly veiled versions of Tarzan and

26:14.340 --> 26:20.620
Doc Savage. Lord Tiger, the Opar books, and the adventures of the peerless peer also have Tarzan

26:20.620 --> 26:24.880
like protagonists. We asked Farmer when he developed his interest in Tarzan.

26:49.800 --> 26:54.420
But later Farmer picked up on Tarzan again. This time he saw Tarzan in a different light.

27:14.340 --> 27:21.900
This is a very interesting thing before. He was not just a child who'd been cast away

27:21.900 --> 27:27.800
and raised by great apes and then become a creature of the jungle, then returned to playing

27:27.800 --> 27:38.160
sports, and he was sort of an archetype of many, many heroes from classical myth.

And now I'm sure that when Burroughs wrote this, he didn't know what he was doing,

27:42.680 --> 27:47.340
but he did unconsciously. I think it was the creation of Tarzan and the Strogan

27:47.340 --> 27:53.240
Genius. Burroughs is not a great writer, but he has created a great character just like

27:53.780 --> 28:00.060
A. Conan Doyle is not a great writer, but he created a great character, Sherlock Holmes.

28:01.100 --> 28:06.840
Philip Jose Farmer, an author with a seemingly endless supply of unique ideas who appears just

28:06.840 --> 28:08.960
now to be gaining widespread acceptance.

28:16.540 --> 28:21.360
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

28:21.360 --> 28:25.200
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

Thank you.
