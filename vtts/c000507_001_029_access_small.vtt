Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.440 --> 00:33.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.380 --> 00:44.380
And here are your hosts. This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.460
Edward Bryant is on the forefront of the young writers who will likely shape the course of

00:48.460 --> 00:52.840
science fiction in the 80s and 90s. We ask Bryant his definition of science fiction.

00:53.960 --> 00:58.860
Science fiction is essentially the same as any other fiction. It's fiction about people,

00:59.080 --> 01:02.540
about characters, about the relationships between one character and another,

01:02.540 --> 01:08.820
or one character in a group, which may be society, with the difference from mainstream

01:08.820 --> 01:13.640
fiction being that in science fiction there is some sort of scientific or technological

01:13.640 --> 01:20.160
development which is important to the story and which affects those human relationships

01:20.160 --> 01:26.040
between person and other person or person and people as a group.

01:27.020 --> 01:31.380
Bryant grew up on a ranch in Wyoming. After he completed graduate school,

01:31.380 --> 01:35.680
he began writing short stories. To date, he has published three collections of short stories

01:35.680 --> 01:41.300
among the dead, cinnabar, and particle theory. We ask Bryant why he prefers to work in the

01:41.300 --> 01:47.040
medium of the short story. It's not a matter of conscious choice. I write what I do because

01:47.840 --> 01:55.490
that is what I do. I plan to write novels. Of course, I've been planning to write novels for a

01:55.490 --> 02:03.270
long time. My publisher is expecting by October 1st a novel which was originally contracted

02:03.270 --> 02:14.590
in 1974. This is a long while to be dithering about completing the book. Short stories have

02:14.590 --> 02:24.310
just always seemed to me the appropriate medium that I should work in. In some ways, to degree,

02:24.310 --> 02:34.910
I feel like short stories are mini novels because I have often spent much more time

02:34.910 --> 02:42.450
in terms of working out the characterizations, the plots, and so forth and so on. Then the amount of

02:42.450 --> 02:53.170
space in that short story would indicate. There are stories of mine that seem to me to be

02:53.170 --> 02:58.630
almost compressed novels that under other circumstances were I more a prolific writer.

02:58.830 --> 03:07.130
I probably could have expanded them out another 54,000 words and got a nice paperback original novel.

03:07.690 --> 03:14.810
But I like to work with the compression sometimes. I like to pack an incredible amount,

03:14.810 --> 03:25.130
which is a risk of course because I fully recognize that a lot of people who read my stuff

03:25.130 --> 03:31.470
don't care to deal in that sort of thing. They don't want to have to worry about putting that

03:31.470 --> 03:37.630
kind of energy into reading a short story that they might ordinarily apply to at least starting

03:37.630 --> 03:44.030
to approach a novel. Phoenix Without Ashes is Brian's only novel published today, and it's a

03:44.030 --> 03:48.650
collaboration with Harlan Ellison. We ask if he is planning to publish a novel eventually.

03:49.470 --> 03:56.250
I think I really believe that there are things that I want to write about that I can treat

03:57.150 --> 04:04.470
much better as novels than I can short stories, and I think I would do that. I think right now my,

04:04.930 --> 04:12.930
the bottleneck factor is that I haven't done a scratch novel that's worked. I've done Phoenix,

04:12.930 --> 04:18.390
which is a novelization. I've done Cinnabar, which is a sort of piece work novel made up of

04:18.390 --> 04:25.350
parts that were originally published as short stories. And I've done a 60,000 word novel,

04:25.750 --> 04:30.550
which remains in my files, has never been rewritten, has never been submitted professionally,

04:30.910 --> 04:36.770
is not science fiction or fantasy. It's the traditional college novel that editors know and

04:36.770 --> 04:42.370
abominate. They get thousands of them every year. They're the novels that people write just after

04:42.370 --> 04:49.190
college, in which the young writer says, well, I have come of age in this society, and here are

04:49.190 --> 04:54.330
the wonderful truths that I have learned, and they put all this into fiction, and it's usually just

04:54.330 --> 04:58.610
pretty terrible stuff. More on Edward Bryant on our next show.

05:05.570 --> 05:10.630
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:10.630 --> 05:14.450
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:00.150 --> 06:04.090
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:20.010 --> 06:25.250
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.590
And here are your hosts.

06:34.050 --> 06:39.330
This is Bill Vernon. And David Carson. Science fiction writer Edward Bryant is the subject of

06:40.030 --> 06:44.450
probably Bryant's most important contribution to date is his collection of connected stories

06:44.450 --> 06:48.870
called Cinnabar. Here Bryant tells something about the city of Cinnabar, the place around

06:48.870 --> 06:56.850
which the stories revolve. No matter what the story or novel, no matter how complex the

06:56.850 --> 07:03.170
ultimate product might be, originally there always is the single image somewhere along the

07:03.170 --> 07:09.210
line that everything else is generated from. In the case of Cinnabar, I suppose the overriding

07:09.210 --> 07:15.970
image is the city itself, the city that exists presumably millions of years in our future,

07:16.330 --> 07:21.530
and may or may not exist here on earth. That's never really spelled out, nor did I feel it important

07:21.530 --> 07:28.490
to do so. Although I suspect to pin down, I would suggest that Cinnabar is probably very close to

07:28.490 --> 07:39.270
Phoenix, Arizona. I shouldn't be surprised. But in the late 1960s, I just had the image of the far

07:39.270 --> 07:47.050
future, very colorful, emerald city of Oz, sort of apparition wavering out there on the desert

07:47.050 --> 07:54.770
horizon. And of course, once the image was there, then all the questions of both fiction in general

07:54.770 --> 08:01.290
and science fiction in particular generated such as, okay, what is that city all about? Who lives

08:01.290 --> 08:09.850
there? What do they do? I wanted to write about a city of such sophistication and decadence that

08:09.850 --> 08:17.290
science and technology, as Arthur C. Clarke put it in a different context, might as well be magic.

08:17.290 --> 08:25.290
And I wanted to, in terms of the human element, investigate what would people do with their

08:25.290 --> 08:31.690
access to immortality, with their access to technological powers beyond compare. Would their

08:31.690 --> 08:37.510
lives be any less screwed up than they are now in 20th century America or not? So again, I was going

08:37.510 --> 08:44.510
back to that original premise that I believe in, that good fiction is about people and their

08:44.510 --> 08:51.170
relationships. And if you have access to physical immortality, for example, how does this affect

08:51.170 --> 08:56.110
your relationship with the people that are closest to you and the people that you interact with

08:56.110 --> 09:04.210
every day on the street? And that's what Cinnabar finally is all about. Although Bryant conceived

09:04.210 --> 09:12.990
of the stories as separate entities, he eventually realized how closely tied they all are. And it

09:12.990 --> 09:21.730
wrote these stories about that fabulous city, that there was an all over structure that seemed

09:21.730 --> 09:28.230
to be coming out independent of each individual story. And that's why when you read the stories

09:28.230 --> 09:34.330
all together in a book, I feel there is a clear cut beginning and a clear cut ending and there is

09:36.470 --> 09:42.950
progress made through the stories almost as though one were reading a from scratch novel,

09:43.150 --> 09:48.430
even though of course it isn't. I weasel a lot with the definition of what is a novel there and

09:48.430 --> 09:54.470
what isn't. Still, the background is the same from story to story. Most of the characters are the

09:54.470 --> 10:01.010
same from story to story. The origin of the name Cinnabar is an interesting story. Here Bryant tells

10:01.010 --> 10:11.490
us what inspired it. Now the city title, strangely enough, came originally from a photograph of a horse.

10:13.330 --> 10:23.430
My mother in her living room has a beautiful photograph of the head of a Palomino. This was a

10:23.430 --> 10:27.930
picture she told me about when I was growing up because this was the horse that she used to ride

10:27.930 --> 10:35.630
in the summers out at a dude ranch in upstate New York called Cinnabar. And I'd always loved the sound

10:35.630 --> 10:42.130
of the word. It conjured up all sorts of images for me that I think went far beyond your standard

10:42.130 --> 10:56.050
upstate New York dude ranch. More on Edward Bryant's Cinnabar next time. This has been the

10:56.050 --> 11:00.890
Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced

11:00.890 --> 11:03.590
in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:44.270 --> 11:48.150
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:03.950 --> 12:09.230
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:11.910 --> 12:13.550
And here are your hosts.

12:18.090 --> 12:23.670
This is David Carson. And Bill Vernon. Our show today centers again on the Cinnabar stories by

12:23.670 --> 12:29.770
Edward Bryant. In the acknowledgments of Cinnabar, Bryant writes to Joan Bernat, who pioneered in

12:29.770 --> 12:35.410
the writing of Cinnabar stories. Here he explains this acknowledgement. Joan Bernat was a very good

12:35.410 --> 12:41.250
writer who did a number of stories at the early clarion workshops which were published in various

12:41.250 --> 12:47.490
anthologies and I have no idea where she is now. But at one point in the workshop we'd done an

12:47.490 --> 12:53.650
exercise in which each of us came up with various narrative hooks, first lines of stories which

12:53.650 --> 13:01.450
were calculated to catch the interest of the reader. And I had done a story hook which went

13:01.450 --> 13:08.550
along the lines of, oh I think the road to Cinnabar was lined with the shells of burnt-out school buses.

13:09.890 --> 13:16.870
And I had no particular reason for coming up with this line other than to me it was interesting and

13:16.870 --> 13:23.010
also this was vaguely tied in with my image of Cinnabar, the city. Well a number of people in

13:23.010 --> 13:27.870
the workshop borrowed other people's narrative hooks and wrote stories around them and Joan Bernat

13:27.870 --> 13:34.390
actually did the first Cinnabar story in the sense that she wrote a story which started with that line.

13:35.950 --> 13:41.130
And her Cinnabar was not quite the same as mine but still there was something of the feeling

13:41.130 --> 13:47.510
about it, the almost surrealistic image of the city wavering on the horizon, the city which is

13:47.510 --> 13:51.810
totally cut off from the entire rest of the world in fact for all intents and purposes

13:52.310 --> 13:58.770
is the entire world. And so that's why Joan Bernat got the acknowledgement at the beginning of the book.

13:59.570 --> 14:04.490
The stories collected in Cinnabar are not the only Cinnabar stories, others have been published

14:04.490 --> 14:09.370
elsewhere. We asked Brian if he has plans to write still other stories in the Cinnabar milieu.

14:09.370 --> 14:18.070
I've thought about it. I have notes on several Cinnabar stories including the possibility of

14:18.070 --> 14:25.670
doing five novelettes which would come together as another makeup novel about the character Jade

14:25.670 --> 14:34.110
Blue. My publisher and I would like to do a new edition of Cinnabar with a brand new Cinnabar story

14:34.110 --> 14:40.850
in it. But I don't know, I just haven't been able to do a Cinnabar story. It may be that its time

14:40.850 --> 14:50.670
has passed in terms of my own professional nature. The Cinnabar stories that I've got planned out would

14:50.670 --> 14:55.490
take place before the time of the stories in the book itself because of course at the end of the

14:55.490 --> 15:00.850
book, I don't think I'm giving away any plot secrets here, Cinnabar is in the process of being

15:00.850 --> 15:09.730
destroyed and I've had no desire to write stories about Cinnabar after the fall. But before

15:09.730 --> 15:17.030
there are still possibilities, I would like to do for example a story about a man in Cinnabar who

15:17.030 --> 15:23.130
comes up with the greatest decadent luxury anyone could have. I thought for a long time about what

15:23.130 --> 15:32.310
single luxury would be the most decadent, the most useless example of conspicuous affluence. And I

15:32.310 --> 15:38.090
realized of course that probably what would be comprised in that would be having your own roller

15:38.090 --> 15:43.290
coaster. I mean think how decadent to have your own roller coaster sitting out behind your house

15:43.290 --> 15:49.970
which only you use or your friends of course. And so immediately because I love roller coasters a

15:49.970 --> 15:55.510
lot started to design my own version of the ultimate roller coaster and that is going to be

15:56.350 --> 16:03.110
the the central image in that particular story if it's ever written. Another Cinnabar story which

16:03.110 --> 16:11.390
is yet unwritten is what happens when Turmaline Hayes decides to have an enormous party at which

16:11.390 --> 16:19.130
she invites every single one of her old lovers of which she has quite a few. And this will simply

16:19.130 --> 16:25.890
be a party at which you have no idea whether it's going to be a romantic comedy or a murder mystery.

16:26.550 --> 16:31.230
A lot of possibilities there. In our next show we'll talk more about Edward Bryant.

16:38.690 --> 16:43.450
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Mason Science Fiction

16:43.450 --> 16:47.270
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:30.470 --> 17:34.430
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show so stay with us.

17:50.270 --> 17:55.530
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:58.270 --> 17:59.850
And here are your hosts.

18:04.370 --> 18:09.270
This is David Carson and Bill Vernon. Today we continue with our interview with Science Fiction

18:09.270 --> 18:13.730
author Edward Bryant. Those who are at all familiar with Bryant's work have certainly

18:13.730 --> 18:19.330
come across his apparent fascination with sharks. Here he explains how this attraction was spawned,

18:19.330 --> 18:24.570
then how it led to the famous short story titled Simply Shark. Why sharks?

18:26.390 --> 18:30.710
You know when people visit my apartment they see all sorts of shark paraphernalia, you know,

18:30.710 --> 18:37.450
jaws mounted on backboards and shark mobiles, shark paintings and so forth and so on.

18:38.610 --> 18:46.430
The reason for the shark motif and the reason that I suppose I've adopted the shark as a sort of totem

18:46.850 --> 18:53.490
is because in the early 70s one of my closest friends had dreamed the night before,

18:53.490 --> 18:59.530
and she told me about this at breakfast, that she had been in the body of a shark. She had

19:00.290 --> 19:07.610
seen the world through shark-colored lenses. And we talked about this for a while, you know,

19:07.650 --> 19:13.630
got past the obvious Freudian symbolism of it all, and I was fascinated by the dream.

19:14.930 --> 19:22.170
Then she catalyzed action by saying, listen, why don't you write a story about sharks? Now I didn't

19:22.170 --> 19:26.310
know anything about sharks. I was just an inland boy who'd grown up far from the sea,

19:26.790 --> 19:31.530
and although the ocean was always fascinated me, I didn't know about sharks. But I did my research,

19:31.890 --> 19:37.590
just as with say particle theory. I found out about sharks, I became intrigued by their position

19:37.590 --> 19:44.710
in the evolutionary scheme of things, how incredibly well developed they are, and I was also struck

19:44.710 --> 19:52.710
by such images as the fact that the shark is the major species of creature which is hostile to

19:52.710 --> 20:01.210
human beings, which is in no danger of extinction, at least at this point. So I took my friend's

20:01.210 --> 20:09.430
original dream and I said, okay, I've got a character who wants to be a shark. Why does she

20:09.430 --> 20:15.790
want to be a shark? How does she become a shark, both metaphorically and literally? And that's how

20:15.790 --> 20:23.370
the original shark story generated. I realized after finishing the story that there were other

20:23.370 --> 20:30.170
things that involved sharks that I had not dealt with in the story that I would treat in various

20:30.170 --> 20:43.010
other pieces. When Bryant's friends got one of his newfound fascination, he began to be bombarded

20:43.010 --> 20:49.630
with shark mementos. What happened then, of course, was the older you get, I think the harder you are

20:49.630 --> 20:54.090
to shop for your friends and relatives, they don't know what to get you, they know what your

20:54.090 --> 21:01.170
tastes are, they don't know what books you've read or what albums you don't have. So somehow the

21:01.170 --> 21:05.870
shark story caught the fancy of the people around me and I started giving me a shark paraphernalia.

21:05.970 --> 21:11.690
Before I knew it, I had more sharks than I knew what to do with. I'm glad it was sharks because

21:13.090 --> 21:18.350
Jawsnaught was standing. There never has been that much in the way of shark artifacts for sale. If

21:18.350 --> 21:23.210
it had been unicorns or dragons, say, I would have been swamped completely and utterly and I could

21:23.210 --> 21:29.650
have knick-knack and Gigo garage sales, but instead I've got some pretty neat shark stuff.

21:30.130 --> 21:36.190
Does Bryant really like sharks? I would say, though, that people ask me,

21:36.510 --> 21:40.730
do I really like sharks? And I have to admit, I don't like sharks. Nobody likes sharks,

21:41.470 --> 21:51.230
but I respect sharks. And sharks as an emblem, as a symbol, truly do fascinate me. And I expect

21:51.230 --> 21:56.410
there will be other shark stories. There may even be a shark novel. What militates against a shark

21:56.410 --> 22:03.410
novel, of course, quite aside from any of my own feelings about writing a novel, is I probably have

22:03.410 --> 22:21.210
to wait for the furor of Peter Benchley's Jaws to continue dying down. More on Edward Bryant on our

22:21.210 --> 22:25.210
next episode of The Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

22:25.210 --> 22:29.050
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:15.350 --> 23:19.290
Coming up next is The Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:35.150 --> 23:40.470
This is The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:43.170 --> 23:44.810
And here are your hosts.

23:49.350 --> 23:54.070
This is David Carson. And Bill Vernon. In the fall of 1981, Edward Bryant's important

23:54.070 --> 23:58.470
short story collection, Particle Theory, was published. It contains memorable stories,

23:59.070 --> 24:05.210
the thermals of August, the nebula award-winning Giants, the often reprinted Shark, the Hibakusha

24:05.210 --> 24:10.750
Gallery, and the title story. The story Particle Theory is unique in Bryant's canon in that its

24:10.750 --> 24:16.010
background is heavily laden with hard science. Here he explains how any writer can get across

24:16.010 --> 24:22.190
hard science ideas if he uses the right resources. Particle Theory came about because I read a

24:22.190 --> 24:28.810
newspaper article about pion beam therapy using a stream of solid particles, sub-nuclear particles,

24:29.030 --> 24:35.190
to attack cancerous tumors, which I have just found out is a line of research that has just

24:35.190 --> 24:40.130
been abandoned down at Los Alamos. I'm not sure why, whether it's funding cutbacks or whether

24:40.130 --> 24:44.830
they've simply found better means to attack the medical problem. But at any rate,

24:45.770 --> 24:51.390
what had intrigued me a number of years ago in the paper is now apparently scientifically dead.

24:52.370 --> 25:00.610
And yeah, this is more of a hard science story than I customarily write, but I think it exhibits

25:01.830 --> 25:09.410
a more general principle, which is that I, or every other writer who may not be all that

25:09.410 --> 25:17.470
soundly based in science and technology by discipline or by vocation, need simply only use

25:17.470 --> 25:24.490
the research tools that we all reasonably learned in junior high to get across a hard science story

25:24.490 --> 25:31.630
without being overly didactic about it. What I discovered in this story was that the world is

25:31.630 --> 25:36.190
full of experts who were quite willing to share with me their specialized knowledge, whether it was

25:36.190 --> 25:41.270
particle beam physics or whether it was the landscape around Los Alamos and

25:43.090 --> 25:49.330
little details for verisimilitudes such as what airline do you fly into Los Alamos on and what

25:49.330 --> 25:54.890
sort of planes are you in and all of that kind of thing. Bryant comments here on the fact that he

25:54.890 --> 26:00.130
does not wish to be typecast as a writer of any particular type of story. It's true, ordinarily

26:00.130 --> 26:05.470
I don't use quite so much scientific content. All I can say is this was one of the stories in

26:05.470 --> 26:15.010
which that content seemed appropriate and it exhibits my own, in a sense, my own sense of

26:15.010 --> 26:23.430
frustration with being typecast. I write what I like to write and sometimes that may be a story

26:23.430 --> 26:32.150
which is full of medical research about prostate cancer and particle beam therapy for that cancer

26:32.770 --> 26:41.110
and cosmology, all that and other times I will write science fiction stories in which there is not

26:41.110 --> 26:49.230
a speck of hard research or hard fact. Again, I suppose it illustrates the difference between facts

26:49.230 --> 26:57.310
and truths to be facile about it but it also shows that good research can cover a multitude of sins.

26:57.850 --> 27:03.110
He maintains that even with the hard science elements, particle theory is still a people story.

27:03.770 --> 27:09.610
This story for me is still a people story first and foremost. It's again about relationships of

27:09.610 --> 27:17.690
people and the scientific content amplifies, illustrates and I hope clarifies those relationships

27:17.690 --> 27:23.190
but by God the people still come first and the science and technology comes second.

27:29.310 --> 27:33.790
Bryant's first published short story collection, Among the Dead, came out in 1973.

27:34.610 --> 27:39.830
It contains a number of stories written early in his career. His novel Phoenix Without Ashes is in

27:39.830 --> 27:45.470
fact a novelization of Harlan Ellison's original pilot script for the ill-fated television series

27:45.470 --> 27:52.030
The Star Lost. This work is a rarity. As a novelization which came after the fact, it is actually a

27:52.030 --> 27:57.470
solid piece of work. The planned sequels have never materialized. Certainly Edward Bryant has

27:57.470 --> 28:02.650
established himself as a top flight writer who happens also to work under the label Science Fiction.

28:10.050 --> 28:14.270
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin

28:14.270 --> 28:18.850
Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
