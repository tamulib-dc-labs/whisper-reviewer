WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:12.720
Okay, the tape is on. So we'll act straight and all that. Okay, also ever
present in the series is the bondage. I mean, you've got the physical bondage of

00:12.720 --> 00:23.100
Estri, but you've also got the, I guess, metaphoric bondage of the whole planet,
that sort of thing. What was the, was that just Estri's fate? I mean, that's

00:23.100 --> 00:31.080
when she lived and that's the breaks, folks? Well, we're all stuck in this
physical body. And were also, what was, I think, annoying me most was the

00:31.080 --> 00:43.100
limitations of logic. That was the bondage that was bothering me at the time. I
was fooling around with Dino's paradoxes, Ulysses and the Tortoise and the rest

00:43.100 --> 00:50.720
of that, trying to make some determination on my own as to what was going on.
And we were throwing up our hands in that project and saying, well, you know,

00:50.780 --> 00:58.940
there's no way. We're never, while you're in a human body and immersed in time,
there's no way you're going to be able to make any determination as to the

00:58.940 --> 01:11.000
nature of time or the degree to which it preceded motion space, what comes
first, the chicken or the egg thing. So there's bondage on every level.

01:12.300 --> 01:21.840
Certainly the limitations of the intellectual part of what I was talking about,
and I'm just carrying it out and being consistent. The female and male bondage,

01:21.840 --> 01:31.680
equally, really, for those characters. They were tremendously limited by their
genetic sexuality. So I meant it that way, too. And fooling around with the

01:33.460 --> 01:46.460
trying to show people that it's fun. There's an element in young girls which
makes rape fantasies attractive. And the reality is not in any way attractive.

01:47.360 --> 01:57.940
Trying to point that difference out. that it's not nice if it happens to you.
That's another reason I did the first book, particularly First Person. Violence

01:57.940 --> 02:08.300
is not fun. If you've ever been in a difficult or violent situation or ever been
tied up or attacked by hospitals or any of the above, you find that it is an

02:08.300 --> 02:20.980
altered state in which you are not happy to be. And some of that, indeed, was
from experience. We got into a lot of dicey situations during our New York time

02:20.980 --> 02:32.980
and the time that we were underground. And my husband was a federal fugitive,
and life was tough. So there are the bondages on every level. But I think for me

02:32.980 --> 02:48.080
it was the intellectual bondage combined with the internal bondage of a person
to their own sexuality, whichever sex or sort of subset of sex that we have now,

02:48.380 --> 03:02.820
so many open groups of people who are changing sex or choosing to copulate with
the same sex or whatever they want to do, everybody is stuck within the bondage

03:02.820 --> 03:12.160
of their genetic conditioning, whatever it happens to be. I mean, you don't see
too many people that have transcended on any level what their genes are allowing

03:12.160 --> 03:20.740
them to do and what their physical body is allowing them to do. As we said
before, I just haven't reached God status yet. It's very frustrating. The Wind

03:20.740 --> 03:31.860
from the Abyss was one of the most frustrating books I've ever read. And by
frustrating, I mean I was really pulling for Estri and here she was, this kind

03:31.860 --> 03:40.600
of cute little sorority girl again with no brain and no abilities. And I've read
that. I think Tanith Lee does a good job with that chapters at a time, but this

03:40.600 --> 03:49.440
was the whole book, or at least a good part of the book, and so that's something
I really enjoyed, was that frustration that, you know, I wish she'd hurry up and

03:49.440 --> 03:59.040
break out of it so we can get on, and that was very interesting. That was quite
a good job of writing. Well, I was really trying to make it real and give them

03:59.040 --> 04:07.740
something that can bring back to this world of news, you know, part of the
reason that you abstract so far, and the reason I had them have no awareness of

04:07.740 --> 04:17.320
our culture and our science and our mores, was so that what is useful and what
is, in a sense, universal will stand out better. I mean, that's another, that's

04:17.320 --> 04:30.720
the value of fantasy if it's done well, is what is not armed is very familiar.
I'm glad you enjoyed that. Very much so. I got to ask this question, where are

04:30.720 --> 04:43.380
we in We Earthlings 1983 during Silistra? Are these humans that have descended
from us, or have these preceded us, or what? What's your idea on that? They're

04:43.380 --> 04:52.360
over there having all this right now while we're over here stuck by ourselves.
That's my feeling about it, that it's all right now out there somewhere, and

04:52.360 --> 05:00.440
that we're just not, you know, we're just in the big terms, if you consider, you
know, the distances involved, and I'm sure you know this, we've only been

05:00.440 --> 05:12.100
civilized for a minute. So nobody would have found us yet if there's something
out there. So it could all be going on exactly now, and we just aren't a part of

05:12.100 --> 05:28.800
it. What would our compatibility index be with the Silistrans? Oh, dear. Well,
let's say just for the sake of being positive, pretty good. I would think it

05:28.800 --> 05:37.240
wouldn't be too bad. I mean, the chances of you fathering a child on a
Silistran woman. Yeah. You're the interviewer. 95%. Okay. Okay.

05:39.840 --> 05:44.240
Okay, now we come to the Kerrion saga,

05:45.440 --> 05:52.080
whatever, Kerrion books, whatever. Once again, was this a planned series? Did
you cold-bloodedly set out to say, I'm going to write three books? Yeah, I was

05:52.080 --> 05:59.720
cold-blooded, yeah. I was going to do three. I signed for them before I did
them. Three was all there was going to be. Three is all there is going to be.

06:00.440 --> 06:08.840
Unless something drastically changes, then I see where it's some place that I'd
like to take it. I knew exactly where I wanted to talk about physics and the

06:08.840 --> 06:20.620
rest of it. I wanted to create a female character that had all the flaws that
Estri did not. It was totally opposite. And to talk a little about politics, I

06:20.620 --> 06:32.500
come from a very political background. My half-sister was Carter's speech writer
on economic policy. I know way too much about politics to suit me. And I want to

06:32.500 --> 06:44.860
talk a little bit about politics. and decision-making at higher levels and what
indeed happens to the people involved in it and the people affected by it who

06:44.860 --> 06:57.220
have no control of it. And the nice stuff for me that balanced it off was a
culture that was comfortable with its technology, growing into its technology,

06:57.220 --> 07:05.040
growing along with its technology. And, I mean, for me, the Cruisers were the
main characters there. I loved doing the cruiser sections, although they were

07:05.040 --> 07:18.100
very difficult at times, to make it really seem as if they were cruisers. And,
you know, one never knows if one succeeds, but for me they really were cruisers.

07:18.200 --> 07:27.160
Plus, I had the whole of history to draw on. Instead of having a culture that
had nothing to do with us, I had a culture that had everything to do with us.

07:27.260 --> 07:35.900
There had been no collapse, no World War III. Everything had preceded a pace and
just gotten worse. The problems with quantum mechanics hadn't been solved. The

07:35.900 --> 07:44.200
problems with nothing else had been solved. And we were just sort of muddling
along the way we tend to do. And that, to me, was a lot of fun. But as I said, I

07:44.200 --> 07:55.240
did the partial, and it went to auction in two countries on the partial. And I
was sold it here in England at the same time. Had two editors trying to keep the

07:55.240 --> 08:03.480
volumes consistent. You know, every editor has a different idea of what exactly
they want you to do, and they all want to mix in. It's very seldom you get an

08:03.480 --> 08:12.840
editor that leaves you totally alone. It doesn't bother you at all about a book.
And I had to split the difference on one occasion between them when one editor

08:12.840 --> 08:22.320
wanted one section to be longer and the other one wanted the same section to be
shorter, just the same 30 pages. And I ended up doing a prologue, which seemed

08:22.320 --> 08:28.440
to satisfy them both. I think they forgot what they asked me to do, but I had to
do something super. So I had done that.

08:57.020 --> 09:05.280
So they were good understanding of technology. Otherwise, you're writing a
historical, a book that was meant for the 40s, which just happens to be set in

09:05.280 --> 09:14.200
the 80s. And people aren't dealing with technology. They aren't even dealing
with the romantic end of it. No end of it whatsoever. So I'd go to these

09:14.200 --> 09:20.380
conventions, and they'd all raise their hands and say, yes, they want more
science. And yes, they were ready to work a little. And yes, they wanted to be

09:20.380 --> 09:33.040
challenged. And I said, OK, but we don't. And I wrote a book in which I wrote To
my ideal reader, didn't talk down, didn't simplify it, did what I consider a

09:33.040 --> 09:42.180
good job of explaining mathematics as poetry, and just let fly. And so far, the
reaction to it's been very good. As I told you, the first printing, it's been

09:42.180 --> 09:50.040
through two printings before publication or three, and it's been doing very
well. You get some people that don't want to work, but I think there's enough

09:50.040 --> 10:01.800
story there to carry them over the parts that they are not willing to try to
understand. I want to take this opportunity now to look at the characters. I

10:01.800 --> 10:10.260
kind of mentioned this on the phone the other night, but this is for the tape.
We're introduced, the first character, other than Shebat, and this is Marada,

10:10.520 --> 10:21.360
the man. We like him at first, but then he obviously turns into a bastard. And
then Chaeron is dislikable at the first. I didn't care for him, and then he turns

10:21.360 --> 10:30.260
likable. David Spry, I never did like. I'm not talking about the way he was
written, but the character. He just bothered me. And then in the first series,

10:30.840 --> 10:42.740
is it Chayin? How was his name pronounced? He was a bastard at first, and then
he turned out okay. And Sereth kind of switched back and forth. So the point is

10:42.740 --> 10:53.220
your characters do turn out to be, they seem to be one thing, and then they turn
into something else. and for one thing, most science fiction doesn't have

10:53.220 --> 11:04.740
characters this deep, but they certainly aren't chameleons like this. How do you
do that, and what are you driving at here? Okay, well, I find that in life,

11:05.040 --> 11:14.880
people tend to show you what they aren't at first meeting, for one thing. What
you're getting from a person in an initial meeting is what they want to project,

11:15.160 --> 11:24.400
which is usually something that covers their faults. and very few people are on
it, so a first meeting of somebody is almost always a polar opposite. They're

11:24.400 --> 11:33.500
covering their weaknesses. They're trying to direct you in a particular
direction as to their view of them. At times you get an impression of what they

11:33.500 --> 11:42.520
would like to be if they're very good at it, and it disintegrates from there.
You can get less than that from people, but I find in life that you can't judge

11:42.520 --> 11:54.440
a person at the first meeting. i knew from the Marada character initially was
meant over the period of one book to turn from an apparent good guy to a

11:54.440 --> 12:07.440
troubled bad guy over the over the three books Chaeron was supposed to make that
same kind of transition and even Shebat who is in a sense a traditional heroine

12:07.440 --> 12:16.480
in the first book is really an ancillary character in the third book so those
were structural things that I was doing purposely, consciously, and for fun in

12:16.480 --> 12:25.940
those books, because I think that they say something about humanity. But I never
lied to you about any of those characters. Marada's father had a handle on both

12:25.940 --> 12:34.120
those kids from the beginning, and he told them straight and true, exactly what
they were. The other thing that was stated in the beginning, which was

12:34.120 --> 12:43.440
consistent, if one wanted to accept it from the reading, is that all pilots are
crazy, and anybody who becomes a pilot is going to get crazy within what the non

12:43.440 --> 12:56.500
-pilots consider sanity and as Shabaku came closer and closer to her cruiser she
did find her relations with humans more and more tenuous Spry held back so much

12:56.500 --> 13:07.320
information there were hints in the first book that Spry was not at all what he
seemed and what he wanted to do was very different from what it appeared to be

13:07.320 --> 13:19.080
that he was doing, but he was the most fun of the characters to work with
because he had no pretensions of a higher morality in the term of long-term good

13:19.080 --> 13:29.300
beyond his interaction with the other pilots, you know, what he wanted for them.
And even that was reasonably short-term. He was just a pragmatist and a mover

13:29.300 --> 13:39.360
and shaker, the kind of guy that gets things done. An intelligence type, really,
is what he is, having known a number of them. and intelligence types tend to

13:39.360 --> 13:53.060
behave very much like that. You really don't see them until later on. You must
have met some in your work. Oh, yes. Yeah, if you were ever going to do any more

13:53.060 --> 14:01.560
in this milieu, I'd think a prequel featuring the old man would be interesting
because I hated to see him die off because he was really a good character,

14:01.680 --> 14:14.260
really enjoyable. Yeah, I felt bad about that, too. I usually give a character a
choice you want to die now or you want to limp along a bit longer and with that

14:14.260 --> 14:21.400
particular character he chose his moment he had it together and he got his
things done and he had to do

14:24.480 --> 14:35.900
a prequel would not be a bad idea it would be fun what happened was conceptually
that I think Earth Dreams took it about as far as I would dare take it without a

14:35.900 --> 14:46.640
lot of feedback from an audience that they were willing to go another step into
that kind of abstract thought. I did that to find out if people really, really

14:46.640 --> 14:58.620
are willing and interested in putting in that kind of effort in a book. I don't
know. I'm going to find out. I'm going to hear back. But to take it further

14:58.620 --> 15:10.200
would be to get very, very abstract with the concepts involved. and I would
rather back up and do a simpler one, but you've got to fulfill the things that

15:10.200 --> 15:17.420
you say you're going to do in a book, and I couldn't leave that book without
handling the technical problems that I had created. I had to solve them or at

15:17.420 --> 15:28.500
least explain them. Where do you get feedback? Do you go to cons, or do you just
think that the sales reflect, the sales are feedback? Well, I used to go to more

15:28.500 --> 15:36.720
conventions than I do now, one, because I've been doing books out of genre, I
don't go a lot, and my research, when I'm researching, takes up a tremendous

15:36.720 --> 15:46.340
amount of time, too, because I'm just, on one hand, I'm arrogant and I like to
control things, but on the other hand, I'm very sensitive and I can always

15:46.340 --> 15:56.640
manage to get offended at somebody says. I was guest of honor at Caracon last
year. I did that one, and I'm going to do Lunacon in March because I really like

15:56.640 --> 16:08.660
that New York ground. Otherwise, I mean, my writing schedule is very heavy. I
just turned in a book. I just started a book, which is doing just about the

16:08.660 --> 16:20.740
amount of time I have to finish it. I don't have a lot of extra time to do more
than the work that I'm doing. I'm real conscientious on my homework. A lot of

16:20.740 --> 16:28.080
times, you can never know enough about the subjects that you're writing about.
When you're creating Whole World, you find there's something that you need to

16:28.080 --> 16:36.000
know that you haven't. Physics alone will not get you through science fiction,
novel, nor will any other specialty, not biology. There's no single thing you

16:36.000 --> 16:44.040
can do that's going to allow you to create an entire culture and change it. It's
not just creating the culture. You've got to be able to create it and change it.

16:46.260 --> 16:58.500
So the homework really takes a tremendous amount of effort. And it's nice to do
a fantasy book now almost as a break or a paid vacation, because that homework I

16:58.500 --> 17:08.280
did years ago, and I remember all the things I need to know to do that. I think
I have like three books on my desk. Heracles, Cosmetic Fragments, one on Asian

17:08.280 --> 17:16.300
fighting styles and a classical dictionary from Oxford. And that is all I need
rather than, you know, three shelves and a stool and a pile on the floor of

17:16.300 --> 17:29.860
stuff that I have to be able to refer to all the time. So cons, the kind of
feedback you get at cons isn't as good as, I get feedback through letters um i

17:29.860 --> 17:38.320
don't trust reviewers because when my first book came out aj buddry's reviewed
me twice on the same book and two different publications it gave me two totally

17:38.320 --> 17:48.860
opposite reviews so i learned my lesson early um but sales figures and letters
are really the way and also you know there are readers around here i do some you

17:48.860 --> 17:58.180
know i do book signings and i do small things where i can control it a little
better than i can it's a real big i mean i'll do a world con or um i went to

17:58.180 --> 18:07.940
england for c con i do one or two a year but it's really all the time that i
want to give it um it takes me about a week it's a different person that has to

18:07.940 --> 18:17.280
go to a con my writer is too open so i had to create this other person my author
and the author goes to the cons and it takes me about a week to get rid of this

18:17.280 --> 18:26.520
author afterwards because when you sit at that typewriter there's no room for
you the writer you have to erase yourself so that the characters can be there

18:26.520 --> 18:37.040
and the story can come and if I'm self-conscious or somebody has said something
to me about there being too much science or not enough science or that my books

18:37.040 --> 18:47.280
are fantasies to get really obsessed with those fantasy labels um I'm liable to
take it too much to heart and to react to it on paper and do something to my

18:47.280 --> 18:55.300
story which I don't want to happen because it's something that's happened I just
got a real good review in the New York Daily News And I hate the good ones as

18:55.300 --> 19:04.280
much as I hate the bad ones. They never like them for the right reasons. So the
best thing really is just the letters from people who read them three times and

19:04.280 --> 19:13.860
loved them or who asked me intelligent questions, which I try to answer. And
other writers, I get sometimes good feedback, especially in the Sanctuary

19:13.860 --> 19:21.600
Project where we're all working with the same train and thought. And everybody
switches material before it gets turned in. I get good feedback from those

19:21.600 --> 19:32.900
people. but in the end I've got to be happy with it if I'm not happy I hold a
book a couple months before I turn it in and you have a gut feeling if you've

19:32.900 --> 19:39.880
left something out or you've screwed up The Earth Dreams was the only time I
ever knew that I pleased myself and I wondered whether I was going to please

19:39.880 --> 19:49.600
other people the only book that I really took it to an extreme that I think is
important to do and valuable in the long term but which may not suit everybody

19:49.600 --> 19:50.340
in the short term

19:53.420 --> 20:08.520
Okay, one of the central themes in the first two carrion books especially was
Shebat's problem with her magic versus carrion science. And that seems to

20:08.520 --> 20:17.320
hearken back to what you said earlier about your experience as being a logical
person who was having problems with precog and ESP. It's very annoying to have

20:17.320 --> 20:26.480
dreams that come true. My specialty is car dreams. If there's going to be
something wrong with my car, I have a dream about it. Two flat tires on the road

20:26.480 --> 20:35.320
to Chicago in the rain, right? I wake up and we buy two tires and the other two
go flat. I had a nice one where I woke my husband up in the middle of the night,

20:35.400 --> 20:42.360
said Brand Auto Supply, and went back to sleep. It turned out that the only
place in New York City you could get a flat fixed on Sunday at that point in

20:42.360 --> 20:51.940
time was Brand Auto Supply. We found out two weeks later. This makes no sense to
me. I don't like it that these things happen. I have gone to great lengths to

20:51.940 --> 21:06.080
find good logical explanation for something that doesn't make any sense without
a lot of === . If, indeed, consciousness is the only thing that moves and

21:06.080 --> 21:14.080
everything else is fixed, then I'm just getting information from other parts of
what is, in essence, one large feature which, in my sleep, are available to me.

21:14.260 --> 21:22.560
That's one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is just to step forward
and backward arrow and you're bouncing around. But whatever it is, there's more

21:22.560 --> 21:29.560
going on in the space-time universe than we have been able to quantify
mathematically, and there's absolutely no doubt about it.

21:32.840 --> 21:44.220
There's been some talk about experiments that seem to prove the breakdown of
Einstein's separability. If there's more work to back that up, then that would

21:44.220 --> 21:56.700
be very helpful for me in my personal quandary with these things. But it does
exist as an insoluble problem right now. So I tend to keep tackling it. And

21:56.700 --> 22:10.580
tackling it with Shebat, who is really an ignorant child who took on a veneer
of civilization but remained very primitive throughout, was a nice way to tackle

22:10.580 --> 22:18.220
it in the face of all the heavy abstract stuff. I mean, here's this character
who is willing to admit that she doesn't understand the physics or the space

22:18.220 --> 22:24.140
-time manifolds, and if she turns on the cruiser and it goes, it's the same
thing as, you know, I mean, a woman can't change a tire, doesn't know how her

22:24.140 --> 22:34.940
engine works, but she can drive. I needed that character and the magic, really,
to balance off the

22:34.940 --> 22:40.640
space-time navigation stuff and the temporal stuff that was going on toward the
end of the book.

22:44.940 --> 22:55.080
Okay. Unfortunately, I haven't written which book this quote came from, but I
have a little short quote I want to read to you from that and get your comment

22:55.080 --> 23:04.040
on it. This is talking about Shebat, and it says, She agreed with the Kerrion
position that fiction and fantasy were acid eating away at the substructure of

23:04.040 --> 23:13.020
society, that these could foster nothing but discontent in malaise. And then the
paragraph goes on to say that basically the computers drove away music and

23:13.020 --> 23:25.040
poetry. So here we have the two sides conflicting. Have you resolved that
conflict is really true? I never had the conflict. That's a little joke. I have

23:25.040 --> 23:37.260
an element of sarcastic humor. It's something that I gave the culture. I really
don't have any problem personally with that, but I think that some people do. So

23:37.260 --> 23:48.540
when I see something like that, I will take it to an extreme and put it in. And
to me, it's just a form. I mean, that's in the same part. I guess that's in

23:48.540 --> 23:56.120
Dream Dancer, and it's right along there with the guy who went in the huge
Pentagon-type building and has been there for 150 years and never came out, and

23:56.120 --> 24:06.800
I kept seeing him. Right, right. So those are all the, in a sense, those are to
be taken not too seriously. One gets playful every once in a while. But at the

24:06.800 --> 24:21.880
time, I was a little concerned with the degree at which editors in the field of
which there are too few, right, tended to want to control what the writers were

24:21.880 --> 24:33.380
doing. I mean, somebody had asked me for an idea of what was going to go on in
the rest of the books, And I wasn't about to give it to them because I don't

24:33.380 --> 24:39.940
think you should write. Homer said the same thing. You shouldn't write the same
book. You shouldn't tell the same story twice. And I want my first draft to be

24:39.940 --> 24:48.500
for everybody rather than having to write it once for the editor and write it
again for the public. As I said before, you run a risk there of leaving

24:48.500 --> 24:57.900
something out because you've already said it. I do believe in the freshness of
the first draft. And although I clean my draft up and do in essence a second

24:57.900 --> 25:13.380
draft when I retype I try to keep as much as the original whatever is good I
keep we have a problem for the artist in this society and it's engendered by the

25:13.380 --> 25:27.220
people who are the middlemen who take your art and purvey it to a public whom
they do not respect it's in the sales managers and the art directors and

25:27.220 --> 25:35.640
sometimes in the editors if you have a good one you don't feel it. I have a very
good one right now and I'm very comfortable. As long as I know writing for this

25:35.640 --> 25:43.020
particular editor that if I meet my own standards this editor is going to love
it and not going to give me any problem about it because it's an intelligent

25:43.020 --> 25:53.920
editor with a good understanding of science and a willingness to admit that he
doesn't know when he doesn't know. I had an editor at one point that stood up

25:53.920 --> 25:58.760
for all the little fists, and space turned red and said, well, I never took high
school science, and I don't understand it, and I don't think anybody else will

25:58.760 --> 26:08.460
either. Somebody like that should not be editing science fiction. They should be
editing ladies' romances. They really don't belong in this kind of field. I

26:08.460 --> 26:19.380
mean, I'm very protective of the right of someone who does this kind of work to
experiment and to take shots. It really is the only free area where you can do

26:19.380 --> 26:30.560
it. Avant-garde is not a viable commercial area. in science fiction, because its
middle list is. And so you can please the publisher and also please yourself

26:30.560 --> 26:38.760
write something that has some validity that will get people to think. It's
really important that people think for themselves. I mean, here we have an open

26:38.760 --> 26:48.720
free society, the only one in the world in which the information that you're
allowed to have is limited pretty much by your ability to collect information

26:48.720 --> 27:00.160
and nothing else. I mean, I had that particle deemed stuff before it was
declassified. You can get it if you really want it. Or you can get enough to

27:00.160 --> 27:08.560
know what's going on. There's some stuff that right now I imagine is pretty
highly classified about an EMP defensive weapon. But if you know what EMP is and

27:08.560 --> 27:18.060
you know what it does, then you know what they're working on. We have this right
to ask questions, to know and understand, to get the information here. We don't

27:18.060 --> 27:30.360
have it anywhere else. And yet we're subjected to a sort of censorship by
mediocrity and I don't like that I think that the value really of our literature

27:30.360 --> 27:39.160
is to give information to move these people to get them thinking and we get all
these a lot of science fictions read by kids in high school great kids like I

27:39.160 --> 27:46.920
was who haven't decided what they want to do yet if I can move three or four
kids to try and find the answers to those questions and those kids go into

27:46.920 --> 27:55.040
technical fields and do something interesting then I've done something that I
consider important so in that way I mean I was angry but when I'm angry I make a

27:55.040 --> 28:04.760
little joke because I can't be crusader rabbit and I'm not going to change the
world and all I can do is change the world that I make so I make a world and I

28:04.760 --> 28:11.780
have it have good things and bad things about it and I run the characters
through it and let them be human in it and hopefully we all learn something I

28:11.780 --> 28:20.420
mean they surprise me every once in a while they come out a little better or a
little worse than I thought that they were alright Right. With regard to that

28:20.420 --> 28:31.240
two cultures thing, it's been my experience that scientists have a lot less
trouble with the two cultures than people in the humanities. I mean, I know a

28:31.240 --> 28:40.160
lot of scientists, me included, are very interested in philosophy and things
like that. And I don't find a lot of humanities people who are that interested

28:40.160 --> 28:46.480
in science or care and are very antagonistic. And that's always puzzled me,
which is why I wanted to ask you about that, because I thought it might be a

28:46.480 --> 28:58.900
little bit of a humorous dig. Yeah. That bothers me. I get that, too, because
there are a lot of so-called literary writers in science fiction, You know,

28:59.000 --> 29:10.000
enough of them so that I have had run-ins with people who are writing science
fiction for reasons that I don't, you know, just to make social comments or just

29:10.000 --> 29:21.580
to allow themselves literary freedom. Stuff that seems to me totally valueless.
And they come down on me very hard because in a sense they're threatened by the

29:21.580 --> 29:33.340
kind of work that I'm doing. They don't want to do that work. I think people
with a strong technical background and who are comfortable with math and with

29:33.340 --> 29:44.220
the physical world, you can't understand the world if you don't understand
physics. And to say that to someone is in itself upsetting. And you've got a lot

29:44.220 --> 29:54.080
of people who grew up and got liberal arts degrees and they're finding that it's
not helping them with the real world, and they're hostile. There are, there's a

29:54.080 --> 30:04.460
technological backlash, which you must be aware of. And they want us, if we're
going to be technologically literate, to stay out of their world. They don't

30:04.460 --> 30:11.600
want to hear about it. They want everybody who is comfortable with technology to
have a very large head, very thick glasses, and stay in their world and press a

30:11.600 --> 30:19.800
computer. They don't want them out in the world. because they feel that the
world is their place and the sensibilities and the humanities that they are

30:19.800 --> 30:28.020
concerned with are somehow threatened by computers because they don't understand
them, because mathematics, because they've never learned it, by anything. It's

30:28.020 --> 30:39.560
just the typical resistance to new things that people have. I hesitate to name
writers, but there are people that have good style that are writing science

30:39.560 --> 30:49.100
fiction who are not writing science fiction. They just happen to be writing and
selling stuff as science fiction so that they can take advantage of the freedom

30:49.100 --> 30:58.760
without doing what I consider paying your dues. They don't know what they're
talking about. They really do not, and they don't belong between cutters that

30:58.760 --> 31:07.740
say science fiction on them. I'm like on the obverse camp. I'm from the
technical side saying, why aren't these people doing any homework? Why don't

31:07.740 --> 31:16.640
they even attempt to understand the world? We can't understand philosophy. At
this point in time, if you don't get into the mathematical philosophers, that's

31:16.640 --> 31:27.180
where it is. Geocrinometry is philosophy, man. The philosophical questions in
space and time are the questions in philosophy at this moment. I mean, even 20

31:27.180 --> 31:35.500
years ago, with Grinbaum and Wittrow and those guys, that was the leading edge.
And so you get these people who are in the so-called humanities who are trying

31:35.500 --> 31:45.460
to live in the late 19th century now. and eventually they're not going to be
able to make a living doing that. You cannot exclude what is the most power of a

31:45.460 --> 31:53.400
society and still claim to be speaking for that society. You really got me going
now, I'm going to stop. Great, no? It's going to get me into a lot of trouble.

31:55.160 --> 32:05.220
Remember, we edit, so we won't get you in trouble. My little lecture. Another
thing I felt to be an inside joke, which I thoroughly enjoyed, maybe it wasn't a

32:05.220 --> 32:17.520
joke, but Raphael Penrose, who was a descendant of the well-known Roger Penrose,
complete with this watch that got passed down. Is that factual? And do you know

32:17.520 --> 32:26.820
Penrose? I don't know him personally. He's my favorite of all the guys working
in that area. I love Twister's theory. He makes all the sense to me in the

32:26.820 --> 32:39.740
world. And I have read, sedulously, everything he has written. And the thing
about the watch actually came from, God, what is it? It's a Symposium on General

32:39.740 --> 32:49.560
Relativity, I think Cambridge published it, in which he had a paper talking
about particularly his watch. So I thought it would be a lot of fun to take his

32:49.560 --> 33:01.020
watch, but I was betting on him. I sat down and I said, okay, now who is going
to be, in 250 years, one guy that's alive today and working now is going to be

33:01.020 --> 33:13.600
still valid and important to that society, and he's my guest. I think that
Twister theory has a good chance of proving to be 80

33:13.600 --> 33:22.160
% valid. I really like the fact that Twisters have to spin before they have
anything else. It's a very complicated... If you're familiar with the concept,

33:22.220 --> 33:32.260
you know what I'm talking about. Right. If not, this is no place to give you a
short course on Roger Penrose. Yeah, I'm very interested in him as well and have

33:32.260 --> 33:38.820
enjoyed that theory, although I haven't seen much on it in the last year or so.
Right. Well, I think this is a couple of years old. Well, they haven't been –

33:38.820 --> 33:49.320
they got the basics down. And I talked to somebody who is a mediocre physicist
and also a science fiction writer who said an interesting thing to me, which was

33:49.320 --> 33:55.640
that – I asked him what he thought of it when he talked about it. While he said,
well, you know, if he's right, then we don't have anything left to do and we're

33:55.640 --> 34:05.820
all out of jobs. So part of the resistance to the kind of stuff he's publishing
stems from the fact that it just might be that that structure is indeed a bottom

34:05.820 --> 34:14.060
-line structure. And he's running into the sort of resistance within the
community that everybody runs into if they have an actual good idea, God forbid.

34:17.200 --> 34:25.460
So there's a sort of self-censorship within those guys, too. But you're right, I
haven't seen anything in the last year from him. It doesn't mean that the

34:25.460 --> 34:38.360
structure and what's going on there is any less valid. I could make you a zerox
of the article I have from the Centennial Symposium. If you don't have that,

34:38.500 --> 34:47.660
you'd probably like to see it. Sure, if it's no problem, I'll talk to you about
it at the end, which, by the way, will come eventually, don't? I don't have that

34:47.660 --> 35:00.800
many more questions. If you're still game, I am. I'm fine. Okay. Shebat referred
to the universe in one of the books as an amenable universe, which I guess is

35:00.800 --> 35:15.280
another name for participatory or anthropomorphic, basically the same
philosophical principle as the one in Silistra. Right. Okay. A little more. It

35:15.280 --> 35:24.200
was a little more quantum mechanical this time, I think, than last time. and
certainly a little more sophisticated, but basically the same kind of structure.

35:24.340 --> 35:32.060
And the amenable universe was fun that is. Again, you know, if indeed they're
giving us everything that we think about, if one is a co-creator, then as long

35:32.060 --> 35:41.000
as we keep delving into smaller and smaller degrees of particle physics, we will
keep finding what we look for. But if twisters are what twisters are, then we

35:41.000 --> 35:41.880
found a bottom line.

35:45.200 --> 35:59.240
Now we're going to get into a kind of philosophical question and both of the
series have female protagonists and they are fully capable individuals and yet

35:59.240 --> 36:09.340
they're not... I don't think they would make somebody who would be, let's say, a
stereotypical feminist happy. I definitely don't. Okay, do you get feedback from

36:09.340 --> 36:18.900
that? This seems to me realistic. It is post-liberation and that's why I enjoyed
it. But do you get problems with people who maybe get a little PO'd because

36:18.900 --> 36:28.620
estuary gets beaten up. And you point out that males and females may actually
have different mathematical abilities and different intuitive abilities. Well, I

36:28.620 --> 36:40.800
have just, you must have seen those studies on why women don't do well at math
and pick up math. Right. Because I'm not making this stuff up. I have a nice

36:40.800 --> 36:49.460
degree of facility in math, and I also improve it spatially. You know, I shoot
well, and my pinball's right up there. One can develop these things. It may not

36:49.460 --> 37:00.460
be a genetic thing. It might be a conditioning thing. I can't say a lot. Other
people are working on it, but it is a reality. As far as the rest of it, it's a

37:00.460 --> 37:15.580
problem for females in the age that is coming if indeed it continues to be the
case because without good technical facility, good math willingness to deal with

37:15.580 --> 37:25.200
computers, they're going to be dinosaurs. And the same instrument, one can be
equal at a computer if one masters the computer. There's a potential for real

37:25.200 --> 37:34.880
equality, an intellectual equality, now that has never existed before, partly
because menial labor and physical strength is no longer a great part of what

37:34.880 --> 37:44.580
makes one a functional human being in a society, and partly because of the
concerns of the society itself. It is not going to happen if women don't start

37:44.580 --> 37:57.000
doing their own work in the areas involved and getting their facility out there.
And if I can do it, the rest of them can do it. There's no reason why anyone

37:57.000 --> 37:58.920
should be in a self-inflicted ghetto.

38:01.940 --> 38:14.520
I'd really like to see ladies spending more time trying to become premier in
their fields. the way a guy has to. I mean, it's a responsibility that one takes

38:14.520 --> 38:22.520
on very early in life. I am going to be successful at something specific besides
childbearing. Not that childbearing isn't a nice part of life, but there

38:22.520 --> 38:34.440
definitely is more, and I find the ERA thing very embarrassing. People assume
that I am a feminist, and I really don't want to be associated with a bunch of

38:34.440 --> 38:43.000
ladies standing out in the middle of the street screaming for their rights. It's
just not me. I'm not comfortable with them. I don't agree with them. I don't

38:43.000 --> 38:52.440
like oversimplification. I don't believe that conditioning is a great part of
what makes a person what they are, or that the fact that if you're a little girl

38:52.440 --> 39:03.180
and you don't have pockets in your pants, you're doomed. I don't believe it. A
great degree of it is genetic inheritance, but one does have control over one's

39:03.180 --> 39:11.960
own fate. Intelligence will go where you point it. And there are plenty of
intelligent women out there. I'd like to see them do something with that

39:11.960 --> 39:24.980
intelligence. In a sense, I suppose I was throwing the gauntlet, but at times it
annoys me. I've ended up on panels before I knew better at conventions where I

39:24.980 --> 39:33.440
look around me and everyone else in that panel is a woman and someone has put me
in a ghetto. And invariably they all write fantasy or they all write very light

39:33.440 --> 39:42.140
science fiction. And nobody is writing the sort of thing that I'm writing, and
nobody is interested in talking about what I'm interested in talking about. I

39:42.140 --> 39:51.040
was at one where the moderator said, oh, isn't this wonderful? We're all ladies.
We'll have a consciousness-raising session. And I just about slid under the

39:51.040 --> 40:01.360
table. It's just not my style. It's not what I'm interested in. It's not what
I'm comfortable with. And I don't even mind if large groups of females want to

40:01.360 --> 40:11.940
organize for their rights, although the Constitution does not guarantee any
right except the right to struggle to succeed. Nobody's given you the right to

40:11.940 --> 40:23.820
have anything gratis in America just to try to get it. But they're not speaking
for me. And I'm sure they're not speaking for a large number of perfectly

40:23.820 --> 40:33.420
competent, happy females who are doing what they're doing and have a specific
goal, which is not political, i.e. to work in the field, to do good work, to

40:33.420 --> 40:48.480
create a corpus or body of intellectual work or technical work or any other kind
of work that is satisfying. These characters, Estri in a positive way and

40:48.480 --> 41:01.040
Shebat almost in a negative way, do their best to succeed at something.
Shebat, because she's unfocused, has more of the problems of current-day

41:01.040 --> 41:10.640
females than Estri, actually. Estri had more difficult situations to deal with,
but a much simpler society, really, to deal with it in. And Shebat, in the end,

41:10.780 --> 41:20.780
opted for what I considered the best option for her, which was her cursor and
study and growing as a person, which, for me, was what was necessary for that

41:20.780 --> 41:28.300
character to have. And I got letters from people that said that they cried at
the end. I didn't think it was sad. I thought it was a good idea that she went

41:28.300 --> 41:37.980
off with her cruiser, which is what, indeed, a pilot is supposed to do,
regardless of sex. And I was very surprised to get a letter like that from a

41:37.980 --> 41:47.880
reasonably intelligent person who I actually knew. I mean, I knew it wasn't just
a letter from a strange fan. It was a letter from a person I had met because the

41:47.880 --> 41:57.080
reader had put so much of her own values into the story, the ending was a
different experience for her than it was for me to write her. That doesn't

41:57.080 --> 42:08.140
usually happen. Usually they get what I want them to get. And in this case, the
values of the person reading it were so different from the values of the

42:08.140 --> 42:18.000
character that it made the reader cry. And although I don't think that's bad, it
doesn't mean that I failed as a writer, I think it says something about the

42:18.000 --> 42:28.540
reader. You're going to get a certain number of readers That way I've had
problems with ultra-feminist readers at conventions in minor ways in the

42:28.540 --> 42:38.900
beginning, but mostly from the guys. The women wouldn't read it originally
because of the covers and because of the subject matter. I'm not going to get

42:38.900 --> 42:50.760
it. It's other women writers. I mean, the obvious ones are going to say things
to you, the gay ones, the ones who are very small and kind of mousy. and really

42:50.760 --> 42:59.700
don't have any background in male-female relations to speak of will have the
reactions that those kinds of people will have when confronted with a book like

42:59.700 --> 43:12.500
that. But the reactions that surprised me were the ones from guys who would kind
of give me a snicker and try to pat my butt and that sort of thing. So it's a

43:12.500 --> 43:21.460
problem right now, but I don't think most people that I know have no problems
within their own sexuality. They just are concerned with the world's sexuality.

43:22.280 --> 43:33.640
And as long as each two people, each group of two people get it together, then
the world will take care of itself and we in general will continue as a race.

43:33.820 --> 43:44.500
But because of my familiarity with politics, I'm very aware of how many people
find it possible to make a living in this or that non-profit organization doing

43:44.500 --> 43:59.980
virtually nothing but talking. And there's a great deal of that in the women's
movement. okay here here i like that um okay i've got two more questions we're
