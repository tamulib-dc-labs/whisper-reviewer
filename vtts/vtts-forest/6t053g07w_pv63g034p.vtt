00:00.000 --> 00:11.877
[Silence.]

00:11.877 --> 00:37.460
[Music.]

00:37.460 --> 00:40.144
Thank you, boys.

00:40.325 --> 00:40.886
Excuse me.

00:40.906 --> 00:41.467
Thank you, boys.

00:41.487 --> 00:41.847
Thank you.

00:42.428 --> 00:43.229
Here it is, friends.

00:43.269 --> 00:45.593
Time once again for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads.

00:45.914 --> 00:46.154
Yes, sir.

00:46.174 --> 00:47.857
We're just sitting here on this old pine tree.

00:48.238 --> 00:50.702
We'd like to have you come along down the trail with us.

00:51.022 --> 00:57.352
If you ain't doing nothing, why, just go on in and have a seat there and make yourself at home.

00:57.372 --> 00:59.476
We're going to try to play a few tunes here.

00:59.536 --> 01:02.501
Maybe you'll like some of them, or one of them, or maybe all of them.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.564
But we'll do our best on the whole work.

01:04.932 --> 01:24.139
Here's Robert to do the first one, Robert and his strata-potato fiddle, with a tune called Boil 'em Cabbage Down.

01:24.139 --> 02:06.745
[Music.]

02:06.745 --> 02:09.128
Excuse me, boy, excuse me.

02:09.188 --> 02:11.051
I hit one too many there.

02:11.171 --> 02:13.434
I got started and couldn't get stopped.

02:13.454 --> 02:19.262
Friends, we hope you old-timers as well as you little saplings out there enjoyed that old hoedown.

02:20.323 --> 02:21.425
I'm telling you the truth.

02:21.545 --> 02:23.388
I'm just in a whirlwind here.

02:23.808 --> 02:27.013
But I'm all stewed up here over something, friends.

02:27.073 --> 02:30.237
I'm telling you, I'm really enthused here.

02:30.257 --> 02:36.145
Now, you know, friends, people are always taking pledges of first one kind and another, different things.

02:36.395 --> 02:45.406
kinds of pledges and all, even the president and other office holders, you know, big shots and all that sort of stuff.

02:45.726 --> 02:47.548
They got to take pledges.

02:47.588 --> 02:51.473
They take pledges to uphold the Constitution and different things.

02:52.053 --> 02:56.018
And then a fella goes out on Saturday night and gets full of that rupus juice.

02:56.038 --> 03:02.205
And Sunday morning, he takes a big pledge that he won't do that no more and all that sort of stuff.

03:03.146 --> 03:05.389
You know, there's all kinds of pledges.

03:06.078 --> 03:20.355
Even the missus, the lady around the house, she takes a pledge to make her old man fix the window or build a shelf or carry out the garbage or just lots of things.

03:20.375 --> 03:24.079
I even had to take a pledge on this program.

03:24.099 --> 03:24.840
That's the truth.

03:25.060 --> 03:26.262
I had to take a pledge.

03:27.083 --> 03:35.713
And, you know, I just don't see the only difference in other pledges and my pledge that I really enjoyed taking my pledge

03:36.098 --> 03:39.183
I'm proud of it, and I believe you will be, too.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.466
You would be if you had the chance to take this pledge.

03:42.027 --> 03:48.457
I'm going to tell you more about this pledge in just a minute, but first I guess I better give forth with a sad little ditty here, friends.

03:48.877 --> 03:49.939
Oh, this is a sad one.

03:49.979 --> 03:53.945
I told you we had some sad ones, some sadder, and some little sadder.

03:53.965 --> 03:55.667
This one here is a crying tune.

03:55.687 --> 03:59.193
I ought to do a good job on this one because I usually sound like I'm crying anyhow.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.798
There it is, and it's Somebody's Crying.

04:20.193 --> 04:45.154
Somebody's crying over me somewhere. Somebody's heart is blue. Somebody's crying over me somewhere.

04:45.961 --> 05:01.962
Somebody wants me, too. I tried so hard to keep her love, but we just couldn't agree.

05:02.330 --> 05:09.318
I pray each night to heaven above that she'll come back to me.

05:12.502 --> 05:26.659
I know she's crying over me somewhere, and she knows I'm crying, too.

05:26.779 --> 05:27.380
Help me, boys.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.502
Go ahead and make me cry.

06:03.535 --> 06:30.623
I tried so hard to keep her love, but we just couldn't agree. I pray each night to heaven above That she'll come back to me I know she's crying over me somewhere

06:33.607 --> 06:40.196
I'm crying too.

06:41.598 --> 06:43.241
Who's this crooner they're talking about?

06:44.302 --> 06:45.404
Friends don't hold that against me.

06:45.424 --> 06:46.405
That's the best I can do.

06:46.766 --> 06:47.226
That's right.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.149
I want to tell you some more about this pledge.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.714
I wasn't studying about that song, crying somewhere.

06:52.754 --> 06:53.595
I imagine they are.

06:54.216 --> 06:56.519
Somebody's crying about something.

06:56.539 --> 06:59.544
I was thinking about this conservation pledge here.

06:59.964 --> 07:02.027
That's the pledge I've been trying to tell you about.

07:02.682 --> 07:07.068
Being just how I had to take it, I don't see no reason why these knotheads.

07:08.090 --> 07:09.612
George, I believe y'all ought to take it.

07:09.672 --> 07:10.834
Y'all want to take it?

07:10.854 --> 07:11.154
Yeah.

07:11.174 --> 07:11.915
You want to take it.

07:11.936 --> 07:12.556
That's good.

07:13.137 --> 07:13.618
That's good.

07:13.678 --> 07:17.023
I figured you'd want to, but you're going to do it anyhow, whether you wanted to or not.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.807
But I'm glad that you agree with me for a change.

07:20.268 --> 07:21.269
I'll tell you what I'll do.

07:21.550 --> 07:23.412
Y'all eat after, I mean repeat after me.

07:23.593 --> 07:23.993
Do y'all.

07:24.173 --> 07:24.734
Yeah.

07:24.975 --> 07:26.116
Yeah, repeat after me.

07:26.296 --> 07:27.178
Are you ready?

07:27.198 --> 07:28.740
Now this joins you up, you see.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.135
Now you got to realize what you what you're doing here.

07:32.175 --> 07:35.460
You're really taking a pledge and you know what that means, don't you?

07:35.940 --> 07:36.762
You got to keep it.

07:37.723 --> 07:40.447
All right, you're gonna live up to this, huh?

07:40.487 --> 07:41.789
George, you better live up to it.

07:41.889 --> 07:42.410
Here we go.

07:42.791 --> 07:43.492
Y'all ready, huh?

07:44.052 --> 07:45.455
All right, y'all repeat after me.

07:45.895 --> 07:53.867
I give my pledge as an American I give my pledge as an American to save and faithfully to defend from waste and

07:54.033 --> 07:57.457
To save and faithfully to defend from waste.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.880
The natural resources of my country.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.543
The natural resources of my country.

08:02.823 --> 08:07.729
Its soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.

08:07.749 --> 08:12.054
Its soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.

08:13.175 --> 08:14.717
Now, thank you, boys.

08:15.077 --> 08:15.798
Thank you.

08:15.818 --> 08:16.118
You're welcome.

08:16.138 --> 08:16.619
There you are.

08:16.699 --> 08:17.960
Now, you're a full pledge.

08:18.601 --> 08:19.042
You're a full.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.543
You done took the pledge.

08:20.563 --> 08:22.926
I want you all to concentrate on that, if possible.

08:23.547 --> 08:25.471
And keep the thing going.

08:25.751 --> 08:26.172
Got to.

08:26.733 --> 08:27.655
Well, let's see here.

08:27.775 --> 08:33.225
Friends, we got time here to get along with some more of this fun, foolishness, and false knowledge.

08:33.966 --> 08:40.519
And so I guess maybe if, Slim, you about ready to give forth with your part there, buddy?

08:40.539 --> 08:40.940
I'm ready.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.202
You got about two bits worth?

08:42.683 --> 08:45.488
How about you doing about a dab, dab, and a half, two dabs of...

08:45.738 --> 08:47.001
a tune here.

08:47.021 --> 08:48.504
This is a sad one, ain't it?

08:48.524 --> 08:49.846
No, this is a good one.

08:49.866 --> 08:52.672
Yeah, this just hits us right on the head, don't it?

08:52.692 --> 08:58.043
All right, here's Slim to sing a song, and it's called I'll Be Finished Another Hard Day.

09:12.839 --> 09:18.286
Well, it's good to see that sunset fading away.

09:18.306 --> 09:23.853
I said it's good to see that sunset fading away.

09:25.314 --> 09:29.860
Cause when the darkness comes, I'll be finished another hard day.

09:29.880 --> 09:37.069
I got a miracle jersey, flop the hall, pull off my shoes and rest my dogs.

09:37.109 --> 09:41.074
Well, it's good to see that sunset fading away.

09:42.320 --> 10:09.306
When the darkness comes, I'll be finished another hard day.

10:21.942 --> 10:26.127
Well, it's good to see that sunset fading away.

10:27.789 --> 10:31.974
I said it's good to see that sunset fading away.

10:33.556 --> 10:39.283
Cause when the darkness comes, I'll be finished another hard day.

10:39.303 --> 10:42.347
I gotta pop a little water, teeter, nail and dam.

10:42.748 --> 10:45.351
Chuck and share some corn for the meal grindin' man.

10:45.371 --> 10:48.034
Well, it's good to see that sunset fading away.

10:50.917 --> 10:58.105
Cause when the darkness comes, I'll be finished another hard day.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.026
Well, all right, sir.

10:59.087 --> 11:00.288
Thank you, Slim, thank you.

11:00.668 --> 11:02.731
I'll be finished another hard day.

11:02.751 --> 11:05.955
That's pretty well done there, son.

11:06.055 --> 11:11.982
You know, you boys, y'all, I was just telling you, you got to stop and think what this pledge means now.

11:12.843 --> 11:14.084
You know what it means, don't you?

11:14.825 --> 11:15.546
Or do you?

11:15.566 --> 11:17.228
Well, it means a lot there.

11:17.288 --> 11:19.270
You've got, you're taking a...

11:19.570 --> 11:21.312
Put a good responsibility on yourself.

11:21.332 --> 11:25.055
You've got to protect the natural resources of our country.

11:25.256 --> 11:26.036
You know what that means?

11:26.417 --> 11:29.099
One of the main things it means is to keep fire out of the woods.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.821
Help keep it out of the woods.

11:30.841 --> 11:39.289
I've been driving down the road in my car, have it one time or other, and some leatherhead come along, you know, and he'd see the woods on fire out there.

11:39.529 --> 11:40.410
Maybe it just started.

11:41.231 --> 11:43.213
And he'd say, well, I ain't worried about that fire.

11:43.293 --> 11:45.135
I didn't set the woods on fire.

11:45.195 --> 11:46.236
That ain't my hard luck.

11:46.857 --> 11:48.721
Well, now, that's just ignorant, you know.

11:48.761 --> 11:51.066
He is plumb ignorant to talk like that.

11:51.728 --> 12:03.233
When he could just stop for a minute and go out there and stomp out the fire, maybe the man ahead of him that set the fire out through carelessness, he's miles on down the road, don't know that he set the woods on fire.

12:03.253 --> 12:05.558
That's one of the things, boys, that we got to help watch.

12:06.348 --> 12:09.652
If you're driving down the road and you see a small fire out there, get out and put it out.

12:09.693 --> 12:14.199
If you can't, if it's done got a good start, get a hold of the forester man around there.

12:14.219 --> 12:15.340
He's easy to locate.

12:15.701 --> 12:16.422
Get a hold of him.

12:16.482 --> 12:17.203
Let him know about it.

12:17.243 --> 12:17.964
Do your part.

12:17.984 --> 12:21.448
It don't cost you nothing, and it's really something.

12:21.468 --> 12:24.733
And that's one of the things in this conservation pledge here.

12:25.314 --> 12:26.395
You boys think that over.

12:26.856 --> 12:27.436
We got to go.

12:27.456 --> 12:28.638
We've run out of time, friends.

12:28.658 --> 12:31.662
The old clock on the wall says for us to get, and we're going to have to get.

12:32.023 --> 12:36.068
But before we get, here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you.

12:36.352 --> 12:37.013
Think about it.

12:37.595 --> 12:49.500
Careless fires in the forest and field would no longer have the edge if every true American took the conservation pledge.

13:03.385 --> 13:09.214
Friends, we've really enjoyed our little visit with you here under the old pine tree, and we'd like to have you visit with us again.

13:10.456 --> 13:15.043
So listen to the station announcer, and he'll tell you just when we'll be back, the time and all.

13:15.063 --> 13:27.763
And don't forget, neighbors, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own state forest service, Uncle Sam's Forest Service, and the station that you're now listening to.

13:28.925 --> 13:30.928
Tune us in again, friends, and remember...

13:31.668 --> 13:35.603
Only you can prevent forest and wood fires.

13:35.603 --> 14:05.000
[Music.]

14:05.000 --> 14:15.000
[Silence.]
