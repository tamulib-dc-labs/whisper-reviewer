00:00.000 --> 00:32.077
[Music.]

00:32.077 --> 00:34.724
Well, thank you, boys.

00:34.744 --> 00:35.185
Thank you.

00:35.445 --> 00:36.207
Howdy, friends.

00:36.227 --> 00:36.588
Howdy.

00:36.608 --> 00:45.591
Yes, here it is time once again for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads sitting here under the old pine tree just to show on our ignorance and having a good time.

00:45.611 --> 00:49.360
We'd like to have you just pull up a chair and set a spell there with us.

00:49.340 --> 00:53.388
Here's Robert with the first tune on his little old Stratapotator fiddle.

00:53.428 --> 00:58.058
He got him an old wool sock and cleaned it all up and got it shining and everything.

00:58.098 --> 01:01.465
And here he is with that old tourist tune through Arkansas.

01:01.685 --> 01:08.479
Yes, sir, that's it, Arkansas Travelin'.

01:08.479 --> 02:00.738
[Music.]

02:00.738 --> 02:04.182
Thank you.

02:04.503 --> 02:09.328
Robert, you left out the part there where he says, hey, mister, how far is it to Little Rock?

02:09.388 --> 02:13.573
He says, I don't know, but there's a big rock out behind my barn.

02:14.154 --> 02:15.295
You left that out, Robert.

02:15.315 --> 02:16.437
You reckon we ought to do it over?

02:17.058 --> 02:19.601
Friends, you know, times has really changed.

02:20.121 --> 02:21.142
It's really changed.

02:21.162 --> 02:24.607
Well, you can tell by the way Robert plays Arkansas Traveler how it's changed.

02:25.748 --> 02:28.311
Yep, I've just been a-thinking.

02:28.331 --> 02:29.192
I've been a-thinking.

02:29.645 --> 02:33.110
I hope I didn't get hurt, about the old expression.

02:33.170 --> 02:43.505
I know a lot of you out there have heard the old expression say, well, Grandpa burned the woods, and Grandpa before him burned the woods, and what's good enough for them is good enough for me.

02:43.525 --> 02:46.028
Well, you don't hear that said much anymore.

02:47.270 --> 02:52.818
And when you do, you can just look this character over and size him up and figure the rest of it for yourself.

02:53.499 --> 02:54.720
And I'll tell you another thing.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.563
If you'll just stop to think there a minute,

02:57.100 --> 03:01.356
I just don't believe your grandpa would burn the woods if he's here today.

03:01.377 --> 03:02.581
Or any of these grandpas.

03:03.103 --> 03:04.107
In fact, I know some...

03:04.373 --> 03:07.897
things about grandpas here, I'm going to tell you about in a few minutes.

03:08.498 --> 03:16.086
But I just don't believe that Grandpappy would burn the woods, because if he was here today, he'd be one of the first to realize how bad we need this timber.

03:16.407 --> 03:20.531
Now, when he was a boy coming up, there was just timber everywhere, lots of timber.

03:20.892 --> 03:24.696
There wasn't any sale for the small timber like there is today.

03:25.137 --> 03:34.127
If they'd have had pulp mills, paper mills from Grandpappy's day, they make a market for the young trees that grow so fast here in our southern country.

03:34.445 --> 03:37.690
I mean, in the south, you know, they really go fast.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.434
Well, the paper mills make somebody a good market for them.

03:41.636 --> 03:45.842
Now, if Grandpappy's here, he'd be the first to realize that, and he'd appreciate the fact, too.

03:45.862 --> 03:50.610
And I'll guarantee you that he wouldn't set the woods afar, and he wouldn't let you do it.

03:50.670 --> 03:55.557
Why, he'd give you a strap in there if he was to catch you trying to set the woods afar.

03:55.577 --> 03:57.681
Friends, we need the woods.

03:57.701 --> 03:59.844
We need the woods for the kids in the country.

04:00.204 --> 04:02.528
The woods and the kids grow right on up together.

04:03.031 --> 04:05.856
And they're kids today, but they're grown people tomorrow.

04:05.876 --> 04:10.964
And you set out a little old pine tree there today, and it's a little old scrawny thing, but it's a great big old tree tomorrow.

04:11.425 --> 04:12.787
That's the way the thing goes.

04:13.308 --> 04:16.113
And more and more people are recognizing that every day.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.195
They're seeing it.

04:17.215 --> 04:24.347
We still got a few that thinks they've got to burn off every spring, you know, and get ready for new ground clearing and, uh,

04:24.698 --> 04:29.646
Get ready to plant, and they'll go down the field before they get to hitch old roadie to the turning plow.

04:29.686 --> 04:34.474
The first thing they'll do is fill up their pockets full of matches and go down there and set the field on fire.

04:34.974 --> 04:35.615
Burn it off.

04:35.655 --> 04:38.039
He hadn't have been surprised and lazy last summer.

04:38.059 --> 04:42.166
He wouldn't let the grass take the place like that, you see, and he wouldn't have had to burn it off.

04:42.186 --> 04:44.289
But he was one of them front porch farmers, you know.

04:44.369 --> 04:47.695
He laid up under the shade of the old pine tree and let the grass take the field.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.778
Next spring, he's got to burn it off.

04:50.095 --> 04:56.743
Too lazy to fly a fur around the field or get the neighbors to come over and help him with it or things of that kind.

04:56.783 --> 04:59.406
And first thing you know, he's burnt off all the woods around there.

04:59.426 --> 05:02.690
And then that fall, he gets his old gun, goes down the woods to kill a squirrel.

05:02.710 --> 05:03.652
And there ain't no squirrels.

05:04.092 --> 05:06.956
And then he raises his hand because there's no squirrels.

05:07.016 --> 05:08.517
Well, he's the guy that run them off.

05:09.899 --> 05:11.621
Oh, boy, that thing is a grapevine.

05:11.681 --> 05:13.624
I could just go round and round here with it.

05:13.644 --> 05:16.147
But first, let's go round and round here with Slim.

05:16.527 --> 05:18.870
There'll be not Teardrops Tonight.

05:27.237 --> 05:41.331
I'll pretend I'm free from sorrow. Make believe that wrong is right. 

05:41.331 --> 05:52.145
Your wedding day will be tomorrow.

05:52.145 --> 05:58.957
But there'll be no teardrops tonight.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.331
Why, oh why should you desert me?

06:09.174 --> 06:15.385
Are you doing it for spite?

06:20.714 --> 06:36.580
want to hurt me then there'll be no teardrops tonight.

06:36.580 --> 07:08.352
[Music.]

07:08.352 --> 07:33.212
I'll believe that you still love me when you wear your veil of white. But you think that you're above me

07:33.935 --> 07:58.390
But there'll be no teardrops tonight. Shame, oh shame, for what you're doin'. 
Other arms will hold you tight, you don't care whose life you ruin, so there'll be no teardrops tonight.

08:03.854 --> 08:19.276
Well, thank you, Slim.

08:19.336 --> 08:19.737
Thank you.

08:19.757 --> 08:21.379
That boy can really sing.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.842
Speaking of Grandpa, not you, Slim.

08:23.863 --> 08:24.363
Grandpa.

08:24.423 --> 08:26.246
We was just talking about Grandpa.

08:26.266 --> 08:30.312
I don't believe there's nobody loves their Grandpa any better than I love my Grandpa.

08:30.732 --> 08:31.954
Had two of them one time.

08:32.761 --> 08:37.666
And I still got, I just love all grandpas.

08:37.686 --> 08:40.249
And there's several of them up in my neck of the woods up there.

08:40.289 --> 08:42.051
We got several grandpas around there.

08:42.171 --> 08:45.135
Finest old fellas you ever met.

08:45.155 --> 08:47.517
And believe me, friends, they've got timber.

08:48.058 --> 08:50.140
They've got patches of wood there.

08:50.961 --> 08:54.285
I'd just like to take just a minute to tell you what one of our grandpas up there.

08:54.825 --> 08:58.009
In fact, this old grandpa, he's a grandpa to everybody in the community.

08:58.411 --> 09:04.680
You know, the old fellow, all the kids is married off and gone, and he's there on the old home place, and the old land's laying out.

09:04.781 --> 09:06.103
It's old, poor hill land.

09:06.143 --> 09:07.064
It's laying out there.

09:07.565 --> 09:09.127
So you know what Grandpa done?

09:09.688 --> 09:13.173
He got a hold of the forester man and got him some young pine trees.

09:13.193 --> 09:14.936
He said, now, by gravy, I'll tell you.

09:14.976 --> 09:17.980
I said, these fellows are sitting out all these pine trees here and yonder and about.

09:18.621 --> 09:21.145
By gravy, I decided I want me some pine trees.

09:21.563 --> 09:46.626
Friend that old fella's got one of the nicest forests there that you've ever seen and he's just as particular about it. It's nothing to pass down by his 
house and you'll see him out there with his walking stick wandering around out there in them pine trees. He's...one day i was talking to him about it 
and i called him my name you know and i said, grandpa, i said, what was your idea for planting these pine trees? i said. Uh it's true enough here i said 
you realize you're an old man

09:46.943 --> 09:52.170
And these pine trees, it's going to take a few years before they get up to be great big timber.

09:52.551 --> 10:07.331
He said, well, feller, I tell you, young feller, he said, now, these trees, he said, I know I've about lived my days, but said, somebody's got to have this timber, 
and I just might as well be growing timber as anything else, and just as happy about it as you ever seen.

10:07.391 --> 10:11.277
Now, he wouldn't think of burning the woods off, and don't you think of it either, friends.

10:11.537 --> 10:12.418
Here's the next tune.

10:12.438 --> 10:13.700
I'm going to try to sing this one.

10:14.141 --> 10:16.444
I Found her Little Footprints in the Snow.

10:16.998 --> 10:38.989
Now some folks like the summertime and they can stroll about. Strolling through the meadowgreen, it's a pleasure there's no doubt. Give me the good old 
wintertime when the snow is on the ground. Found her when the snow is on the ground.

10:39.357 --> 10:42.344
I traced her little footprints in the snow.

10:42.364 --> 10:43.165
In the snow.

10:43.486 --> 10:45.951
I found her little footprints in the snow.

10:46.132 --> 10:47.294
Where'd she go?

10:47.395 --> 10:51.203
God bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way.

10:51.504 --> 10:54.430
I found her when the snow was on the ground.

10:54.410 --> 10:59.260
Now when I went to see her, it was a big round moon.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.607
Her mother said she'd just stepped out, she'd be returning soon.

11:03.189 --> 11:06.736
I traced her little footprints, I found them in the snow.

11:07.177 --> 11:10.444
Found her when the snow was on the ground.

11:10.424 --> 11:13.230
I traced her little footprints in the snow.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.493
In the snow.

11:14.734 --> 11:17.139
I found her little footprints in the snow.

11:17.319 --> 11:18.482
Where'd she go?

11:18.582 --> 11:22.391
God bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way.

11:22.531 --> 11:25.277
I found her when the snow's on the ground.

11:25.277 --> 11:41.812
[Music.]

11:41.812 --> 11:45.743
Well now she's up to heaven, she's with that angel band.

11:46.204 --> 11:50.216
Someday I'm gonna meet her in the promised land.

11:50.236 --> 11:54.027
Every time the snow falls, it rains like memories.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.614
Found her when the snow's on the ground.

11:57.539 --> 12:00.162
I traced her little footprints in the snow.

12:00.543 --> 12:01.364
In the snow.

12:01.644 --> 12:04.088
I found her little footprints in the snow.

12:04.228 --> 12:05.289
Where'd she go?

12:05.469 --> 12:09.335
God bless a happy day when Nellie lost her way.

12:09.475 --> 12:12.198
I found her when the snow was on the ground.

12:12.218 --> 12:12.299
Hey!

12:14.962 --> 12:15.903
Well, all right.

12:15.923 --> 12:16.824
Where'd she go?

12:17.706 --> 12:18.186
There it is.

12:18.226 --> 12:20.129
I found her little footprints in the snow.

12:20.349 --> 12:21.791
Friends, we're about to run out of time.

12:21.811 --> 12:23.293
We're going to have to move along here.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.448
out from under the old pine tree and shove off.

12:26.468 --> 12:29.713
But here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you, friends.

12:30.134 --> 12:30.775
Think about it.

12:31.255 --> 12:33.779
Keep far out of the grass and woods.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.262
Let's follow the modern way.

12:35.763 --> 12:39.929
You can be certain if he was here, Grandpa wouldn't burn the woods today.

12:41.372 --> 12:49.164
Oh, I'm ready to go.

12:49.184 --> 12:50.867
Everybody in my boots.

12:54.442 --> 12:58.172
Well, friends, this little session has got to come to a close here.

12:58.252 --> 13:00.478
We've got to move on down the road.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.247
We've enjoyed sitting here on the old pine tree playing for you, friends.

13:04.287 --> 13:06.072
We hope that you've enjoyed it, too.

13:06.558 --> 13:21.136
Because, after all, friends, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation at the station that you're now listening to.

13:21.497 --> 13:23.099
Now, we'd like to have you listen again.

13:23.599 --> 13:24.200
Yes, sir.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.321
Just come right on in.

13:25.341 --> 13:29.106
The announcer will let you know when we'll be back, the exact date and time.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.049
So come to see us, won't you, neighbors?

13:31.489 --> 13:35.434
Remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

13:35.434 --> 14:07.649
[Music.]
