Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear. Hello there, folks.

00:15.715 --> 00:19.609
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:19.977 --> 00:25.282
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:25.723 --> 00:31.288
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:31.929 --> 00:38.215
And today is one of America's best-loved band leaders, Lawrence Welk.

00:38.235 --> 00:39.436
Hello, Mr. Welk.

00:39.756 --> 00:40.557
Hi, Smokey.

00:41.217 --> 00:46.963
You know, we folks who grew up on the farms all learned early in life how important the trees are.

00:47.332 --> 00:49.676
and their value in protecting food crops.

00:50.758 --> 00:56.529
The trees also make a very wonderful home for wildlife and give beauty to the land.

00:56.549 --> 00:59.174
They give us so much and ask so little.

01:00.055 --> 01:02.640
And of course, we all have picnics under the trees.

01:03.822 --> 01:10.875
It's everybody's duty to teach children to be very careful with matches, especially in the outdoors.

01:11.311 --> 01:17.237
Let us impress upon them that only care on the part of everyone can prevent forest fires.

01:18.258 --> 01:24.644
Carelessness in the forest, just as in an orchestra or anything else, can only result in catastrophe.

01:25.304 --> 01:26.345
Isn't that right, Smokey?

01:26.826 --> 01:28.367
It sure is, Mr. Welk.

01:28.848 --> 01:32.872
Now the Sons of the Pioneers have planned something special for you.

01:32.892 --> 01:33.973
How about it, Lloyd?

01:34.453 --> 01:37.556
Smokey, we have a song we hope Mr. Welk will like.

01:37.576 --> 01:38.517
It's an old favorite.

01:41.332 --> 02:03.711
Snow time ain't no time to stay outdoors and smooth so shine on

02:04.180 --> 02:11.157
Shine on harvest for me and my gal.

02:13.924 --> 02:19.438
The night was mighty dark and you could hardly see.

02:19.891 --> 02:23.496
And the moon refused to shine.

02:26.019 --> 02:31.307
A couple sitting underneath a willow tree.

02:31.327 --> 02:35.232
For love, they pined.

02:37.255 --> 02:46.287
The little maid was kind of afraid of darkness, so she said, I guess I'll go.

02:47.498 --> 03:03.315
The boy began to sigh, looked up at the sky, and told the moon his little tale of woe.

03:03.335 --> 03:13.185
Shine on Mr. Harvest Moon, away up in the sky.

03:16.169 --> 03:43.577
I've been missing out on lots of love and some January, February, June or July. Snow time ain't no time for us to sit outdoors and spoon. So shine, shine on Mr. Harvest Moon.

03:44.097 --> 03:48.261
For me and my gal.

03:48.281 --> 03:53.747
For me and my gal.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.849
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:56.550 --> 03:59.673
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:59.693 --> 04:06.040
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:06.100 --> 04:12.687
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:13.173 --> 04:33.363
So until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the sons of the pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:33.383 --> 04:37.729
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

04:37.979 --> 04:42.126
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:42.727 --> 04:46.833
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:47.214 --> 04:49.217
That's why they call him Smokey.

04:49.237 --> 04:51.561
That was how he got his name.

04:51.561 --> 05:02.594
