00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
[Silence.]

00:11.000 --> 00:40.253
[Music.]

00:40.253 --> 00:43.221
Well, howdy friends, how y'all?

00:43.241 --> 00:48.610
Esther, here it is again, time for your old wood rider, Jelly Elliot and Three Knotheads.

00:48.630 --> 00:54.139
Sitting here under the old pine tree, we'll be with you for a little while here, and we'd like to have you listen.

00:54.159 --> 00:56.803
Just stay tuned right there where you are.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.226
Now, exactly the setting.

00:58.566 --> 01:04.075
Just stay right there, because we're going to play a few tunes here, and we want you to listen.

01:04.055 --> 01:17.862
We don't want you to miss a thing, so mother and father and brother and sister and little children and all you little fellas out there, 
drag up a chair or two, just gather around, but we're going to do something or say something here that you will want to hear, so don't miss out on nothing.

01:18.183 --> 01:20.828
And here's something that you'll all want to hear.

01:21.249 --> 01:24.696
It's Robert with his fiddle doing Sally Goodin.

01:24.696 --> 02:11.960
[Music.]

02:11.960 --> 02:19.407
Well, Lord, Robert, you cut it off too short.

02:19.447 --> 02:20.788
I was just fixing to sing there.

02:21.048 --> 02:21.789
Excuse me, friends.

02:21.849 --> 02:26.113
I mean, I was just about to get in the mood to sing, and Robert quit fiddling.

02:26.433 --> 02:28.234
Robert, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.817
I declared sadly good.

02:31.157 --> 02:32.899
Friends, we hope you enjoyed that tune.

02:33.479 --> 02:40.245
Now, friends, in every section of the country, it's the small patches of wood, the small woodlands, that count.

02:41.508 --> 02:43.630
Now, we depend on that a whole lot today.

02:43.670 --> 02:47.294
You'll just be surprised at how much we do depend on it.

02:47.314 --> 02:49.636
And we will be more and more in the future.

02:51.158 --> 03:01.188
It's the little patches that counts, the 40, 60, 120-acre spots of timber that the farmers and other small landowners have in timber.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.929
It don't necessarily have to be a farmer.

03:02.989 --> 03:05.812
It could be a banker, a filling station operator.

03:06.493 --> 03:10.637
Most anybody can own small patches of timber, and that's the ones that count.

03:11.123 --> 03:13.767
Now, we sure need to keep these growing and producing.

03:14.448 --> 03:32.735
The key to this whole business of lumber and other forest products, friends, we all need is in the hands of folks just like you and me who have 
these little small patches of wood that you might have a patch of wood there that you think, well, I'll just keep that small patch down there for firewood.

03:33.115 --> 03:34.397
Well, it's more than that, friends.

03:35.120 --> 03:41.108
Did you ever stop to think there's about four and a quarter million of us small timberland owners?

03:41.809 --> 03:43.692
Well, that's right, four and a quarter million.

03:43.732 --> 03:44.453
Now, think of that.

03:44.873 --> 03:47.537
You might say to yourself, well, I'm just a drop in a bucket.

03:47.557 --> 03:49.219
That's right, you're a drop in a bucket.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.484
But you take all us drops and put us together, and it's a bucket full.

03:53.545 --> 03:58.913
Now, friends, we just got to do everything we can to keep the fire out of these small woodlands.

03:59.694 --> 04:01.236
And ask the local forester.

04:01.256 --> 04:01.897
Now, there you are.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.080
There's a point right there, friends, the local forester.

04:04.499 --> 04:06.643
Now, you take these big sawmill concerns.

04:06.663 --> 04:10.411
They have millions of dollars tied up in a big sawmill.

04:10.431 --> 04:12.796
Now, they're going to see that that sawmill keeps going.

04:13.097 --> 04:14.059
So you know what they do?

04:14.499 --> 04:16.343
They got their own forestry boys.

04:16.724 --> 04:20.211
They got men that know what they're doing, just like our local forestry boys.

04:20.492 --> 04:25.562
Go out there and select the timber that these fellas come through there with a crosscut saw and cut it down.

04:25.795 --> 04:26.536
That's what they do.

04:26.816 --> 04:29.018
Now, that's where your local forestry boy comes in.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.982
That's where he's provided there for you.

04:32.582 --> 04:37.768
That's what he's there for, to help you to select this timber and keep it growing.

04:37.788 --> 04:39.410
So all you got to do is call on him.

04:39.430 --> 04:41.232
He'll be glad to help you.

04:41.252 --> 04:47.638
Now, if you go to stop your land from washing off or something, you don't go to the banker to find out how to do it, do you?

04:47.658 --> 04:55.667
No, you go to the soil erosion man, and he'll come out there and survey that thing off and show you right where you need a big bank throwed up to keep it from washing.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.976
Well, the local forestry boy is the same thing.

04:58.236 --> 04:59.939
He'll come out and help you select that timber.

04:59.979 --> 05:00.740
So call on him.

05:00.760 --> 05:01.721
That's what he's there for.

05:02.542 --> 05:10.573
Friends, don't forget, there's four and a quarter million of us small patch timber owners, and we just got to keep the fire out.

05:10.593 --> 05:11.474
That's all there is to it.

05:11.995 --> 05:13.838
So I want you to help me.

05:13.858 --> 05:17.683
Now, we can make money out of it if, and that if is a mighty big word.

05:17.803 --> 05:20.347
It's a mighty big word just to have two letters in it, if.

05:21.028 --> 05:23.511
If the land is kept free from fire and handled,

05:24.031 --> 05:26.515
to produce the amount of timber it should.

05:26.535 --> 05:30.001
I'm going to tell you more about this, but first I want to play a tune here.

05:30.021 --> 05:32.064
Let's see, I believe Robert's going to play this first one.

05:32.525 --> 05:34.468
Oh, Charlie's going to sing.

05:35.089 --> 05:37.453
Oh, this is going to be good, friends.

05:37.834 --> 05:41.139
I mean, this is going to be, oh, I mean, this is really it.

05:41.580 --> 05:43.803
And Charlie's going to sing.

05:43.823 --> 05:46.748
And here it is, and it's Rock-a-Bye Baby Blues.

05:48.415 --> 05:54.848
Come home in the evening and I'm all tired out.

05:55.168 --> 05:57.854
See, that bed makes me want to shout.

05:57.874 --> 06:03.164
When I lay down with a great big sigh, that's when the baby begins to cry.

06:03.244 --> 06:06.070
I got rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye blues.

06:10.066 --> 06:11.809
Well, when I got married, I thought I wanted four.

06:11.829 --> 06:14.313
But one's enough I can't handle no more.

06:14.593 --> 06:17.238
He frets and he cries and he sure gets loud.

06:17.518 --> 06:20.082
I guess like a father I should feel proud.

06:20.102 --> 06:24.690
I got the rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby blues.

06:24.710 --> 06:41.605
[Music.]

06:41.605 --> 06:44.951
Well, I stumble through the dark, I can't find the light.

06:44.971 --> 06:48.198
What makes you want to cry in the middle of the night?

06:48.218 --> 06:50.602
As mama keeps yelling, stop his crying.

06:50.622 --> 06:53.568
Well, I'm getting a little mad, cause that's what I'm trying.

06:53.588 --> 06:57.876
I got the rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby blues.

06:59.037 --> 07:01.984
Now he just keeps crying at the top of his voice.

07:02.104 --> 07:04.991
And I gotta get up, cause I got no choice.

07:05.412 --> 07:10.704
As a new father, it seems kind of strange when his mama says, see if he needs a change.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.312
I got the Rock-a-bye Baby, Rock-a-bye Baby Blues.

07:14.312 --> 07:31.927
[Music.]

07:31.927 --> 07:36.234
Well, there's an old saying that's sure out of style.

07:36.414 --> 07:39.438
I'll spare the rod and spoil the child.

07:39.478 --> 07:44.847
Now listen, little fellow, when you get about three, it's gonna be a new day between you and me.

07:44.967 --> 07:50.475
I got the rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby blues.

07:50.495 --> 07:50.676
Yeah!

07:50.736 --> 07:51.657
Well, my wife said, You said you wanted a bundle of joy

07:53.611 --> 08:22.167
See, you get up now and rock that boy. Feed him milk, don't you get it too hot. You wanted a baby, well, that's what you got. 
Rock-a-bye baby, rock-a-bye baby blues. Rock-a-bye baby blues. Thank you, Charlie, thank you. 
That's right, get up in the middle of the night, rock the baby. My goodness gracious.

08:22.518 --> 08:26.942
Now, friends, I was talking a few minutes ago about the importance of the small woodlands.

08:26.962 --> 08:28.544
That's the small patches of wood.

08:29.345 --> 08:31.707
You know, I knew a couple one time.

08:31.727 --> 08:33.609
They were friends of mine.

08:33.629 --> 08:37.473
He was a farmer, and he and his wife had a nice place.

08:38.714 --> 08:42.678
And I heard that he'd had an accident.

08:42.698 --> 08:46.982
Well, the whole thing is I felt pretty good over the thing after it turned out like it did.

08:47.002 --> 08:48.364
But the man had had an accident.

08:48.384 --> 08:49.825
He was building a new barn.

08:50.446 --> 08:56.551
And he was putting a roof on, and it fell off and laid himself up.

08:56.571 --> 08:59.274
So I went by to see how he was getting along.

08:59.294 --> 09:00.175
Sure enough, he was.

09:00.215 --> 09:05.239
He was laid up there with a broke leg and falling off this barn.

09:05.259 --> 09:14.668
And he and his wife was having a little argument when I come in, but there wasn't much he could do because he was laying up there flat on his back and didn't feel too good, you know.

09:15.669 --> 09:18.411
But it seemed like that she had...

09:19.049 --> 09:21.413
got a quick price on some timber they had.

09:21.433 --> 09:25.219
They had a 48-acre patch of timber, and I mean it was really nice.

09:26.401 --> 09:34.094
And he had just gone to the expense of building this barn and everything, and cash was kind of low, and they needed quick money.

09:34.114 --> 09:40.786
So she had jumped out there and got a quick price on all of this nice timber on this 48-acre patch of wood.

09:41.507 --> 09:43.470
Well, the old man, he is plenty sore about it.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.271
He just couldn't see it.

09:45.592 --> 09:56.803
All he could picture, you know, of this timber that he'd taken care of and was proud of it, and all he could visualize was all that nice timber cut off of this land, and he just couldn't stand the idea.

09:58.064 --> 10:02.108
So I just stood there kind of back out of the way.

10:02.228 --> 10:09.475
I didn't want to get in the line of fire in any way, and finally I winked at him, and he caught the hint, and I

10:09.725 --> 10:13.689
Kind of give him the wink, you know, and he told his wife, he says, I'll tell you what let's do, honey.

10:13.810 --> 10:17.173
Said, let's just let old Jelly settle this.

10:17.193 --> 10:19.155
Said, let's just let him settle it.

10:19.176 --> 10:19.956
So she agreed.

10:20.357 --> 10:22.599
She said, well, okay, we'll do that then.

10:23.741 --> 10:27.525
So I'm so close to this whole forestry thing, friends.

10:27.545 --> 10:33.211
The first thing I'd done, I just got out there and got ahold of the local forestry boy and he come in.

10:34.432 --> 10:38.517
I went with him and we went down through this 48 acre patch of woods

10:39.357 --> 10:45.245
made a survey of the timber to see what was there and how much of it.

10:45.265 --> 10:52.896
So after we made the survey and figured out what we thought was there, then we called in a timber buyer.

10:54.218 --> 11:01.990
And he come out, and we all three went over the timber, looked it over, made the deal for him, got everything all fixed.

11:03.291 --> 11:09.280
And in the wind-up, friends, those folks got just about double for just some of the timber

11:10.019 --> 11:15.645
that was ready for cutting than the first offer for all of the timber.

11:15.665 --> 11:17.487
I mean, that made me feel good, friends.

11:17.567 --> 11:19.409
It really did.

11:19.429 --> 11:26.236
Now they got the money to keep things going, and they got a lot of nice timber still green and growing.

11:26.256 --> 11:28.779
And now, friends, here's a favorite old fiddle tune.

11:29.099 --> 11:35.706
Robert, to do it on his flower seed fiddle, Take me Back to Tulsa.

11:35.706 --> 12:31.468
[Music.]

12:31.468 --> 12:36.614
Now here is just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you, friends.

12:36.634 --> 12:38.256
Think it over.

12:38.276 --> 12:45.906
Your small woodland will pay double someday if you just handle it right and keep fire away.

12:50.645 --> 13:08.662
Friends, we've enjoyed this little visit with you here under the old pine tree, sitting on a pine knot of picking and singing for you.

13:10.023 --> 13:10.864
We've really enjoyed it.

13:11.004 --> 13:12.365
We hope you've enjoyed it.

13:12.385 --> 13:14.647
We want you to tune us in again.

13:14.667 --> 13:18.411
We're really at heart about this thing, and that's the way we want you to feel about it.

13:18.951 --> 13:19.572
At heart.

13:20.108 --> 13:21.069
We can't do it.

13:21.530 --> 13:23.392
You got to help us do it.

13:23.412 --> 13:27.577
Yes sir, we got to keep that fire out of them woods.

13:27.597 --> 13:40.152
Don't forget friends, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own State Forest Service 
and Uncle Sam's Forest Service through the cooperation of the station that you are now listening to.

13:40.913 --> 13:46.740
Remember friends, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:46.740 --> 14:14.972
[Music.]

14:14.972 --> 14:22.000
[Silence.]
