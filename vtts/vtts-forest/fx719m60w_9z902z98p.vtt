00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
[Silence.]

00:08.000 --> 00:32.752
[Music.]

00:32.752 --> 00:40.744
Today we present the second program in a new series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:40.764 --> 00:44.950
Our scene is the little ranger station in the heart of Beaver Dam Forest.

00:44.970 --> 00:49.396
Ranger Bill is taking advantage of recent rains to catch up on his office work.

00:49.416 --> 00:58.509
His two young assistants, Joe and Sam, are with him collecting some reading material for Ranger Bill's niece, June, to use in her nature classes at Pine Lake Camp.

00:59.311 --> 01:00.312
But June is late.

01:00.764 --> 01:03.307
A very unusual thing for that young lady.

01:05.509 --> 01:06.690
Sam, is that clock right?

01:07.251 --> 01:09.173
June promised she'd be right on time.

01:09.393 --> 01:09.814
I'm worried.

01:09.834 --> 01:13.178
Maybe we should have gone after June and brought us to the station, Ranger Bill.

01:13.278 --> 01:15.280
No, she wanted to hike all the way here, Sam.

01:15.340 --> 01:16.341
She'll be along shortly.

01:18.463 --> 01:21.387
One long, three short.

01:21.407 --> 01:22.147
No, it's not for us.

01:24.590 --> 01:29.115
Say, Ranger Bill, how about this conservation pledge as part of June's material?

01:29.135 --> 01:30.096
Good idea, Joe.

01:30.413 --> 01:32.656
Every person in America ought to know that pledge.

01:32.676 --> 01:33.777
Let's have a look at it, Joe.

01:34.799 --> 01:50.278
I give my pledge as an American to save and faithfully to defend from waste the natural resources of my country, its soils and minerals, its forests, waters, and wildlife.

01:50.859 --> 01:52.841
Boy, that's really something.

01:52.861 --> 01:55.104
Makes you almost want to say amen after you hear it.

01:55.525 --> 01:57.467
I wish a lot of people would feel that way, Joe.

01:57.717 --> 01:58.939
and do something about it.

01:58.959 --> 02:00.320
What are you driving at, Ranger Bill?

02:00.501 --> 02:09.232
Well, Sam, I'm thinking that farmers in particular ought to take that pledge to heart and do something about their 20, 40, and 60-acre woodlands.

02:09.252 --> 02:13.378
Now, their small tracts of trees are a mighty important part of our whole forest resource, you know.

02:13.598 --> 02:14.279
Yes, I know.

02:14.739 --> 02:20.467
I read in that pamphlet you gave us that nearly one-third of all our commercial forest land is in farm woodlands.

02:20.767 --> 02:21.809
Isn't that right, Ranger Bill?

02:21.949 --> 02:22.710
Right as rain, Joe.

02:23.551 --> 02:27.336
And for some three-and-a-quarter million farmers, that means homegrown fence posts

02:27.721 --> 02:31.926
Firewood, building materials, an extra dollar to add to their income.

02:31.946 --> 02:37.192
It's just, well, it's just too bad that so many of them don't realize the value of their forest.

02:38.053 --> 02:40.195
Say, Joe, will you work over there by that window?

02:40.776 --> 02:41.717
Keep an eye out for June.

02:41.877 --> 02:42.718
Yes, sir.

02:42.738 --> 02:43.799
I get it, Ranger Bill.

02:44.199 --> 02:51.007
You once told us that most farmers and other owners of small timber areas are still not doing a good job of handling their woodlands.

02:51.127 --> 02:51.868
That's right, Sam.

02:52.048 --> 02:53.149
Here comes June now.

02:53.550 --> 02:56.293
Boy, she's stepping along mighty fast, too.

02:58.838 --> 03:01.941
Well, it's about time.

03:02.001 --> 03:03.242
Wait a minute, fellows, will you?

03:04.723 --> 03:05.484
What's the trouble, June?

03:05.524 --> 03:06.405
You look down on the mouth.

03:06.685 --> 03:08.146
I'm sorry, I'm late, Uncle Bill.

03:08.807 --> 03:10.789
That's all right, girl, never mind that.

03:10.809 --> 03:11.910
But what's really bothering you?

03:12.090 --> 03:13.431
Well, it's Mrs. McDonald.

03:13.791 --> 03:19.076
I dropped by on the way here, and Uncle Bill, she's much worse than she was last week.

03:19.096 --> 03:20.097
She's very sick.

03:20.257 --> 03:21.919
Golly, that's too bad, June.

03:21.999 --> 03:24.121
Well, maybe you should have stayed there, June, and tried to help out.

03:24.201 --> 03:26.803
Well, I plan to go back, but I want to talk with you.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.331
called me on the phone.

03:28.351 --> 03:29.132
Oh, no, I couldn't.

03:29.392 --> 03:31.434
Not with Mrs. McDonald right there.

03:31.454 --> 03:32.095
What do you mean, June?

03:32.515 --> 03:33.636
Don't you see, Uncle Bill?

03:34.157 --> 03:36.099
Mrs. McDonald ought to be in the hospital.

03:36.439 --> 03:37.740
She needs an operation.

03:37.760 --> 03:38.221
Golly.

03:38.821 --> 03:42.465
Well, the McDonalds figure it'll take nearly $1,000, all told.

03:43.045 --> 03:44.187
Well, they don't have it.

03:44.367 --> 03:47.910
That's mighty tough, June, but I... I thought you could help out some way, Uncle Bill.

03:48.431 --> 03:49.312
You always do.

03:49.952 --> 03:51.514
And this is so important.

03:51.534 --> 03:53.055
Gee, I've got a few dollars.

03:53.095 --> 03:54.256
I'd be glad to chip in.

03:54.336 --> 03:56.959
Me too, but $1,000...

03:57.175 --> 03:58.276
That's a lot of money.

03:58.557 --> 03:59.558
You better forget it, boys.

03:59.618 --> 04:03.283
It's a nice thought, but I'm sure old McDonald wouldn't accept a cent from anybody.

04:04.805 --> 04:05.606
I don't know, June.

04:05.686 --> 04:08.349
I just don't know how I could help out.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.311
Oh, Uncle Bill.

04:11.193 --> 04:12.495
Three long rings.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.517
That's our call, Ranger Bill.

04:14.557 --> 04:14.978
I'll get it.

04:16.320 --> 04:16.700
Hello?

04:17.141 --> 04:18.803
This is the Beaver Dam Rangers Station.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.044
Yes, sir, he's here.

04:20.285 --> 04:21.106
Just a moment, please.

04:21.686 --> 04:23.649
It's for you, Ranger Bill, a Mr. Potter.

04:23.669 --> 04:24.270
Oh, thanks, Sam.

04:25.511 --> 04:26.052
Hello, Bob.

04:28.563 --> 04:30.045
Yes, I know about Mrs. McDonald.

04:30.165 --> 04:30.586
Too bad.

04:33.450 --> 04:33.811
What's that?

04:36.415 --> 04:37.356
Oh, no, he shouldn't do that.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.162
Well, what about the farm forester?

04:41.643 --> 04:45.749
You fellows work together usually.

04:45.769 --> 04:46.330
Oh, is that right?

04:50.496 --> 04:51.197
Well, all right, Bob.

04:51.538 --> 04:52.379
In that case, I'm with you.

04:52.880 --> 04:53.501
I'll see you soon.

04:53.581 --> 04:53.922
Goodbye.

04:54.022 --> 04:54.182
Goodbye.

04:54.584 --> 04:56.946
Well, who's Bob Potter?

04:56.966 --> 04:59.209
Well, if you'll all pipe down.

05:00.210 --> 05:01.571
I'll explain that.

05:01.591 --> 05:02.152
Now, that's better.

05:02.913 --> 05:06.696
Now, Bob Potter is the farm planner for the local soil conservation district.

05:07.257 --> 05:09.279
Now, he works with the farmers to keep their land productive.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.762
He's over at McDonald's place right now.

05:13.003 --> 05:17.648
Now, he says that Mac's planning to cut and sell his timber to raise the money he needs for his wife's operations.

05:17.668 --> 05:18.609
Oh, that's swell.

05:18.629 --> 05:19.590
Not exactly, Joe.

05:20.370 --> 05:22.853
Old McDonald is figuring to let all of his timber go.

05:23.272 --> 05:25.854
Now, somebody's offered him $1,000 for it, for everything.

05:25.955 --> 05:27.916
Small trees, big trees, young and old alike.

05:28.237 --> 05:29.698
Hey, that would wreck his woodland.

05:29.718 --> 05:30.659
That's no good.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.821
I don't think he has to do it that way either, Sam.

05:33.362 --> 05:35.444
And Bob Potter's trying to persuade him not to.

05:35.464 --> 05:36.465
I don't care, Uncle Bill.

05:36.865 --> 05:39.247
If that's the only way to raise the money, I'm for it.

05:39.287 --> 05:40.548
Of course, June, I understand.

05:40.568 --> 05:42.670
But Mac doesn't have to do it that way.

05:43.251 --> 05:45.053
He doesn't have to ruin his entire woodland.

05:45.113 --> 05:47.815
But why did Mr. Potter call you Ranger Bill?

05:48.356 --> 05:52.840
I didn't know it, but he and the farm forester have been working on old Mac for several months about his woodland.

05:53.512 --> 05:57.817
Now, Potter thinks I might be able to convince Mac he doesn't have to clear-cut all his woods, even now.

05:58.698 --> 06:03.003
You see, the farm forester is on a big job at the other end of the county, and Bob can't reach him.

06:03.023 --> 06:04.425
Then you are going to help Uncle Bill.

06:04.485 --> 06:05.026
You are.

06:05.126 --> 06:05.567
Yes, Joe.

06:06.287 --> 06:07.989
And I think maybe we're all going to help.

06:08.009 --> 06:10.693
You, Joe, and Sam, and I. All right, boys.

06:11.093 --> 06:13.877
Get your marking axes, and we'll be on our way to old McDonald's farm.

06:14.557 --> 06:17.401
I'll join you with the truck soon as I make a very important phone call.

06:17.421 --> 06:19.283
Then we'll drive right out to McDonald's place.

06:20.883 --> 06:31.455
There they are.

06:31.976 --> 06:34.339
Bob Porter and Mr. McDonald.

06:34.359 --> 06:36.301
Talking out there in the front yard.

06:36.321 --> 06:38.043
I'll just drive right in by them.

06:38.063 --> 06:39.145
Hey, June, are you asleep?

06:39.645 --> 06:41.447
Why are your eyes closed so tightly?

06:41.467 --> 06:43.310
I'm just making a wish, that's all.

06:43.330 --> 06:43.830
Good girl.

06:44.411 --> 06:47.615
You'll wish real hard and maybe things will work out just fine.

06:47.635 --> 06:49.156
Well, here we are.

06:49.637 --> 06:50.518
Made good time, too.

06:53.654 --> 06:54.435
Hello, Ranger.

06:54.895 --> 06:55.356
Hi, Bob.

06:56.056 --> 06:56.937
Hello, Mr. McDonald.

06:57.057 --> 06:57.538
Howdy.

06:58.138 --> 06:59.780
I think you know these young people, Mr. Mac.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.501
Sure do.

07:00.681 --> 07:01.041
Howdy.

07:01.342 --> 07:05.446
Bob, this is my niece, June Cameron, and this is Joe McGuire and Sam Freeman.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.708
They're both on the job with me this summer.

07:08.569 --> 07:09.850
How is she, Mr. McDonald?

07:10.010 --> 07:11.251
Doing poorly, young lady.

07:11.411 --> 07:13.173
She ought to be in the hospital, I'm thinking.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.936
Well, I'm going right in to see if I can be of help.

07:15.956 --> 07:19.679
My friend Penny would have come with me, but she's gone to Fairview to visit her family.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.362
Well, excuse me, everybody.

07:22.426 --> 07:23.968
That's a good girl, Ranger.

07:23.988 --> 07:25.871
I appreciate her interest in this area.

07:25.891 --> 07:28.034
She likes Mrs. McDonald.

07:28.054 --> 07:30.697
But look, man, if your wife ought to be in the hospital, why don't you get her?

07:30.717 --> 07:34.523
I was aiming to take her, now that I got things lined up and can seem away clear.

07:35.203 --> 07:37.887
But Mr. Potter here, he insisted I wait till you come.

07:38.408 --> 07:40.911
Not that it'll do much good, I'd say.

07:40.931 --> 07:43.375
Well, let's just walk over to there that you're would, Mac.

07:44.136 --> 07:46.919
It'll give us a better idea of what we're talking about.

07:46.940 --> 07:47.320
Come on.

07:47.857 --> 07:48.798
You too, Joe and Sam.

07:48.998 --> 07:52.361
We'll go down past the pig pen, but this can't take too long.

07:53.001 --> 07:54.623
Look at your fields, Mac.

07:54.643 --> 08:00.748
I don't mind telling you you've done a mighty fine job of soil conservation all over the place, except for your woodland.

08:00.768 --> 08:01.509
Yeah, I know.

08:01.549 --> 08:06.233
It took some convincing on your part before I started to control the bad erosion on the place.

08:06.994 --> 08:12.378
Of course, I plow my furrows around the hills now instead of up and down here like I used to.

08:13.159 --> 08:17.863
And I put those terraces in to keep the rain on my fields instead of running off them.

08:18.400 --> 08:18.961
I admit it.

08:19.742 --> 08:24.409
And I'm strip cropping, too, planting clovering like tween regular crop rows.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.673
But what of it?

08:26.693 --> 08:28.616
It's hair wasn't bad thick until now.

08:29.077 --> 08:30.278
Well, it's paid off, and you know it.

08:30.980 --> 08:37.630
It's just that, well, it'd be crazy for you to ruin your valuable wood when you've done such a good job everywhere else on the farm.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.292
That's pretty strong talk, Bob.

08:39.312 --> 08:45.242
But look, man, I've kept fire and my cows out of these woods, and that's paid off, too, in a good stand of timber.

08:45.983 --> 08:46.804
Now I need it.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.893
And I aimed to use that timber to help Sarah get well.

08:50.954 --> 08:51.955
Well, here we are.

08:51.975 --> 08:53.076
And there's your woodland, Mac.

08:53.717 --> 08:55.639
Like you say, it's a fine stand of timber.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.343
Old trees ready to cut, and young growing trees all through them.

09:00.864 --> 09:05.830
I'm afraid I've got to agree with Bob and the farm forester that it'd be a shame to let anybody clear-cut those woods.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.471
All right, so it would be a shame.

09:07.752 --> 09:10.394
But you fellas don't have a sick wife in your hands, I'm a-thinking.

09:11.015 --> 09:14.279
And I don't mind telling you this talk, talk, talk isn't helping things a bit.

09:14.519 --> 09:15.660
I know how you feel, Mac.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.648
But let's get right down to casers.

09:18.429 --> 09:22.357
Bob, you have those figures the farm parts that work up on Mars, Mac's woodland?

09:22.377 --> 09:22.958
Right here, Bill.

09:23.980 --> 09:24.722
Now, let's see now.

09:25.824 --> 09:26.545
Hey, look, Sam.

09:26.585 --> 09:29.190
That's a regular plan for the whole woodland.

09:29.531 --> 09:30.854
There's a map at all.

09:31.335 --> 09:31.856
All right, Mac.

09:32.577 --> 09:35.182
Now, as I see it, you've got 40 acres of woodland.

09:35.202 --> 09:38.188
Now, we can see for ourselves that it's well-stocked with different age trees.

09:38.675 --> 09:43.063
And these figures here indicate that you've got about 5,000 board feet of timber on every acre.

09:43.083 --> 09:43.804
And that's not bad.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.047
40 acres?

09:45.507 --> 09:47.170
5,000 feet per acre?

09:47.651 --> 09:50.216
Why, that's 200,000 board feet.

09:50.236 --> 09:51.138
What's that?

09:51.158 --> 09:55.145
Now, a third of that, or nearly 70,000 board feet, is ready for cutting right now.

09:56.147 --> 09:59.092
Why, Mac, your right timber alone is worth every bit of $1,000.

09:59.192 --> 10:00.394
It is?

10:00.595 --> 10:01.456
You really mean it?

10:01.857 --> 10:02.438
Sure it is.

10:02.654 --> 10:07.320
Golly, the fellow who wants to buy all your trees sure will be getting a bargain, Mr. McDonald.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.342
Yeah, I know that now, son.

10:09.442 --> 10:14.649
And I know someone who'll buy your timber, just the big stuff that ought to be cut anyway to make room for even better woodland.

10:14.709 --> 10:19.054
I'll bet that was the phone call you made before we left the ranger station, wasn't it, Ranger Bill?

10:19.074 --> 10:19.835
Yes, Joe.

10:19.855 --> 10:24.722
I called the Extension Forrester over at State College to see who were on his list of prospective buyers.

10:24.742 --> 10:28.266
Now, he had just the right fellow, too, a man who paid top prices for good timber.

10:28.847 --> 10:29.568
Hey, that's great.

10:29.788 --> 10:31.530
Now, hold on a minute, Reed.

10:32.050 --> 10:39.918
You mean to tell me you can get a hold of a fellow who will buy just my ripe timber and meet the $1,000 off I already got for all my timber?

10:40.078 --> 10:40.778
That's right, Mike.

10:41.559 --> 10:45.403
You've got 70,000 board feet to sell, according to the Farm Forest's report.

10:46.044 --> 10:50.488
Now, I know you can get at least $15 for 1,000 feet for your timber, maybe more.

10:50.508 --> 10:55.833
15 times 70, that's 7 times 15, or 105.

10:55.853 --> 10:57.855
Add a zero, that's...

10:58.308 --> 10:59.489
Why, that's $1,050.

10:59.550 --> 11:01.472
Oh, boy.

11:01.712 --> 11:03.174
And another thing, Mac.

11:03.194 --> 11:06.137
I know this buyer will do a good job of cutting your timber.

11:06.158 --> 11:08.180
Now, he'll cut only the trees we help you mark.

11:08.681 --> 11:11.003
And he'll be careful about the little ones, too.

11:11.023 --> 11:15.208
Because he'll be wanting to come back here in a couple of years or so to cut them when they're ripe.

11:15.228 --> 11:17.091
I'll do it, Ranger.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.394
Then we better get to work marking the trees that can be cut.

11:19.974 --> 11:20.975
I'll call the buyer directly.

11:20.995 --> 11:23.038
And I'll hustle up to the house and tell us the area.

11:23.318 --> 11:25.581
This will make her feel loads better, I'm thinking.

11:25.865 --> 11:28.833
Then it's off to the hospital with her, and I'll come right on back here.

11:29.434 --> 11:33.846
But first, fellas, I got to tell you something.

11:33.866 --> 11:36.854
Now, Mac, there's no... No, no, no, listen to me, Ranger.

11:37.396 --> 11:38.338
Only listen.

11:39.297 --> 11:42.020
I reckon I've been pretty rotten stubborn about my wood.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.123
Have been for years as I look back.

11:45.084 --> 11:46.286
But not anymore, believe me.

11:46.566 --> 11:50.591
That's fine, Mac, but there's no... I'm not finished through yet.

11:50.611 --> 11:54.376
It wasn't the fact that you proved my timber is a lot more valuable than I ever knew.

11:54.676 --> 11:57.980
It's not that nor the fact you're helping me to raise the money I need right now.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.322
No, sir.

11:59.342 --> 12:02.886
It's the way all you pitched in here today to help a stubborn man.

12:03.086 --> 12:05.710
Well, to be honest, Mac, we were thinking of your woodland, too.

12:05.730 --> 12:06.891
Of course you were, and that's it.

12:07.698 --> 12:16.208
The farm planner, the farm forester, the forest ranger, the extension forester up at State College, these two young fellows here.

12:17.270 --> 12:27.182
All of you just as concerned or more about what happens to a 40-acre patch of wood than the farmer owns it.

12:27.202 --> 12:29.164
It's been a good lesson to me, I'm a thinker.

12:31.146 --> 12:34.110
Well, I've got to go tell Sarah, but I'll be back.

12:35.373 --> 12:36.215
Nice going, Bill.

12:36.776 --> 12:37.397
Skip it, Bob.

12:37.878 --> 12:40.564
It's all in a day's work.

12:40.584 --> 12:41.126
Come on, fellows.

12:41.146 --> 12:42.208
We've got a job to do yet.

12:42.769 --> 12:45.295
70,000 board feet of right timber to be marked.

12:45.315 --> 12:47.720
We'll start right here on old McDonald's farm.

12:48.361 --> 12:48.903
All right, Joe.

12:49.524 --> 12:51.709
You can put an axe place on that big old fellow over there.

12:51.989 --> 12:52.611
Ready for cutting.

12:53.633 --> 12:54.335
Yes, sir.

12:54.455 --> 12:55.457
Here we go.

12:55.758 --> 13:10.954
Well, it looks as if Ranger Bill has saved the day again.

13:12.816 --> 13:19.382
You have just heard the second in a new series of programs on forest conservation with Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

13:21.204 --> 13:24.027
Next week, June's friend, Penny Perkins,

13:24.260 --> 13:27.785
figures in an exciting adventure in the little town of Fairview.

13:28.306 --> 13:32.252
The story is called Flash Flood in Devil's Run.

13:32.272 --> 13:34.276
Don't miss it.

13:34.296 --> 13:39.063
Bill Scott's Forest Ranger comes to you with the cooperation of the Forest Service, U.S.

13:39.103 --> 13:40.245
Department of Agriculture.

13:40.886 --> 13:46.875
Bill Scott is written by Bill Burgoffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokamp.

13:46.895 --> 13:49.339
Your narrator has been Al Reilly.

13:49.339 --> 14:40.759
