00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
[Silence.]

00:07.000 --> 00:25.000
[Music.]

00:25.000 --> 00:37.470
Well, howdy friends. It's your neighbor Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads. Yes, we're just sitting under this big old pine tree... as you come down the trail. Just pull down a pine knot and sit on down.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.992
We're gonna try to play a few of these hillbilly tunes.

00:40.292 --> 00:41.855
Might play ones you'd like to hear.

00:41.895 --> 00:45.341
We got a few things we'd like to talk to you about.

00:45.401 --> 00:51.351
So just stay tuned and take her to the backer and spit on the bar.

00:53.457 --> 00:55.640
All right.

00:56.362 --> 00:58.705
Well, we got that and over with right quick, didn't we?

00:58.725 --> 01:01.670
Now, friends, we want you to make yourself comfortable and feel at home.

01:01.750 --> 01:04.134
Pull off your shoes if they're hurting you.

01:04.154 --> 01:08.501
And I know a lot of you ladies out there, your shoes is hurting you.

01:08.521 --> 01:09.523
So just pull them off.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.204
It's all right.

01:10.264 --> 01:12.988
We want you to feel at home and be comfortable.

01:13.028 --> 01:15.432
We're going to play a few tunes here.

01:15.952 --> 01:19.197
And we hope we play one that you like, or maybe all of them.

01:19.618 --> 01:22.643
We're going to get things started off here featuring Deacon.

01:22.703 --> 01:25.328
Deacon, our electric steel man here.

01:25.348 --> 01:28.052
He's just got more steel in his lap than he can handle.

01:28.112 --> 01:34.483
So we're going to get him all wound up here on his double-barrel Ethiopian steam-heated butane-burning guitar with a little bit of Panhandle Rag.

01:34.483 --> 02:14.726
[Music.]

02:14.726 --> 02:15.207
What am I laughing about?

02:15.287 --> 02:16.570
I'm telling you the truth.

02:16.853 --> 02:18.355
I don't know what I'm laughing about.

02:18.435 --> 02:20.298
I'm so mad, I don't know what to put it in.

02:20.338 --> 02:23.663
I'm just as mad as an old wet-settin' hen ever did of me is mad.

02:23.763 --> 02:24.203
You're mad?

02:24.223 --> 02:24.564
You're mad?

02:24.584 --> 02:24.704
Yeah.

02:24.724 --> 02:25.405
Ever ain't so mean?

02:25.425 --> 02:26.887
I've been in the foaming all the way.

02:27.007 --> 02:28.970
Yeah, I'm telling you, Slim, all day.

02:29.251 --> 02:29.811
I'm dangerous.

02:29.831 --> 02:30.653
What's the matter with you?

02:30.673 --> 02:31.374
I'm really mad.

02:31.494 --> 02:33.897
It beats anything I ever seen of.

02:33.937 --> 02:34.658
What's the matter?

02:35.279 --> 02:38.784
Well, Dad Burnett, you know I got two old dogs.

02:39.345 --> 02:39.545
Yeah.

02:39.665 --> 02:40.627
Bird dogs.

02:40.707 --> 02:41.388
Yeah, old hounds.

02:41.808 --> 02:43.030
Bird dogs, and...

02:43.280 --> 02:51.731
They lay around there on the front porch, and every time I come in, I stumble over a dog and fall down, skin or shin, and they eat me out of a house and home.

02:52.151 --> 02:59.560
Had to keep them all the year, feed them about 11 months, feed them 11 months to get to hunt birds with them, about a month.

03:00.321 --> 03:02.244
And I fed them all the year, fed them good.

03:03.045 --> 03:06.129
And there was one old brown had to take him as a veterinarian three times.

03:06.169 --> 03:09.252
He had the pip, gush, and cliff, and the sick alien, and donks, and the cane heppies.

03:09.953 --> 03:11.295
And I got him shot, and

03:11.579 --> 03:14.383
You know, with the hypo needle, I think.

03:14.423 --> 03:19.750
He shot him, and he had to mange, and I had to help him scratch and everything.

03:19.810 --> 03:26.399
I'm telling you, I just had more trouble with them bloomy dogs, and I got a good place where I used to go bird hunting.

03:26.900 --> 03:31.186
And I went over there bird hunting the other day, and when the season opened, what do you think?

03:31.827 --> 03:32.367
I don't think.

03:32.608 --> 03:36.132
Some leatherhead had come along there and burned off the whole country.

03:36.152 --> 03:39.477
Just burned up the woods, burned up all the grass, all the feed.

03:39.659 --> 03:41.922
Why, they couldn't nothing live out there no more.

03:42.663 --> 03:46.608
A polecat would have to pack a three-day lunch to get across that burnt over ground.

03:46.728 --> 03:47.269
That's a tooth.

03:47.289 --> 03:48.170
There's nothing for it.

03:48.190 --> 03:49.091
That beats anything.

03:49.111 --> 03:50.032
Let's play a tune.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.737
I'm just disgusted, and something's got to be done about it.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.679
I'm right here to tell you.

03:55.740 --> 03:56.641
Something's got to be done.

03:56.661 --> 03:58.103
We're going to do something about it, too.

03:58.143 --> 04:00.666
That's got to stop burning off the woods and burning up there.

04:00.686 --> 04:01.447
I'm disgusted.

04:01.767 --> 04:02.448
Let's sing a song.

04:02.468 --> 04:03.169
Who's going to sing?

04:03.638 --> 04:04.579
All three of us, yeah.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.183
All three of us are going to sing at once here, friends.

04:07.243 --> 04:11.509
It's bad enough to have to put up with one of us singing at the time, but right now it's all three of us.

04:11.569 --> 04:14.794
And I don't know what this is going to sound like, but don't hold it against us.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.602
And here it is, Blues, Stay Away From Me.

04:16.602 --> 04:24.628
[Music.]

04:24.628 --> 04:28.313
Blues, stay away from me.

04:34.199 --> 04:37.142
Blues, why don't you let me be?

04:38.424 --> 04:58.587
Don't know why you keep on haunting me. Love was never meant for me. True love was never meant for me.

05:00.423 --> 05:06.971
Seems somehow we never can agree.

05:08.933 --> 05:16.261
Life is full of misery.

05:16.281 --> 05:22.809
Dreams are like a memory.

05:22.829 --> 05:28.135
Bringing back your love that used to be.

05:32.840 --> 05:36.605
Tears so many I can't see.

05:38.567 --> 05:43.653
Years don't mean a thing to me.

05:45.075 --> 05:51.503
Time goes by and still I can't be free.

05:51.503 --> 06:15:195
[Music.]

06:15:195 --> 06:37.000
Blues, stay away from me. Blues, why don't you let me be? Don't know why you keep on calling me.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.544
Well, thank you, boys.

06:40.564 --> 06:41.144
There it is.

06:41.205 --> 06:42.486
Blues stay away from me.

06:42.506 --> 06:43.867
That's what I say, but I got them.

06:44.228 --> 06:47.211
I sure got the blues, I'm telling you.

06:47.545 --> 06:49.989
You know, friend, that beats anything I've ever seen.

06:50.029 --> 06:56.838
Now, you hunters out there, you hunters and fishermen, sports are supposed to be sports, and they ain't.

06:56.858 --> 06:57.640
They're not a sport.

06:58.281 --> 07:03.188
They're sports at heart, but I guess they just don't know how to be a sport.

07:03.208 --> 07:04.009
I reckon that's it.

07:04.069 --> 07:04.590
I don't know.

07:06.072 --> 07:10.198
There's some good in everybody, I reckon, something.

07:10.218 --> 07:17.248
But anyhow, the serious thing is that all us hunters and fishermen, we ought to be more particular with our

07:17.735 --> 07:21.881
our fires out in the woods and the fields and around like that.

07:21.921 --> 07:26.849
You go out fishing or hunting, you build a fire, you ought to be careful with it.

07:26.869 --> 07:33.839
You go out camping and have a wonderful time and maybe you kill a lot of game and kill the limit and just have a good time.

07:33.879 --> 07:38.446
But then you go on home and you're still just as happy as you can be.

07:38.466 --> 07:45.396
You're anxious to get home and show the old lady and the kids what all you've killed and everything and you go off and leave a chunk on fire there where you

07:46.186 --> 07:55.774
had fried fish or something, and then after you're home and just telling all your friends about it, the woods catches on fire and burns over, and next year you go back out there to hunt and fish.

07:55.834 --> 08:00.318
Well, there's nothing to hunt and fish because it ain't got nothing to eat.

08:00.338 --> 08:01.199
It can't stay there.

08:01.259 --> 08:07.064
What don't burn up has to leave or starve to death one, and we get careless with our fires.

08:07.124 --> 08:13.969
I know I have done things like that myself, and there ain't but one difference in me and a lot of you fellas.

08:13.990 --> 08:15.771
I'll admit mine, and you won't.

08:16.409 --> 08:18.091
And that's the truth.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.812
We ought to be more careful about it.

08:20.733 --> 08:28.320
Friends, let's just all join together and see if we can't make this year less forest fires than ever before.

08:28.380 --> 08:33.684
If we don't do something about it, it's just a matter of a short time when we won't have nothing to hunt.

08:33.744 --> 08:38.589
Now, I've kept them dogs all year and fed them, and I got nothing to hunt.

08:38.609 --> 08:43.453
I guess I'll just have to take them out and shoot them or give them away or drown them and do something with them.

08:43.533 --> 08:45.555
I can't just keep them and feed them

08:45.923 --> 08:48.809
Well, nothing, because they're too much trouble.

08:48.849 --> 08:50.011
They cost too much.

08:50.813 --> 08:53.338
An old poor country boy like me just can't afford it.

08:54.180 --> 08:59.571
So the only way that we can stop this, friends, there ain't but one way to do it, and that's for you and me to stop it.

08:59.591 --> 09:00.974
That's just all there is to it.

09:00.994 --> 09:02.717
And we can do it, and we're going to do it.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.938
Now, with your cooperation, friends, we'll stop it.

09:05.958 --> 09:08.421
Did you ever stop to think what one little match would do?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.304
Just a little T-90 match.

09:10.324 --> 09:13.870
Why, it could burn up millions of dollars worth of stuff.

09:14.070 --> 09:16.614
One little old T-90 match, about two inches long.

09:17.635 --> 09:20.780
It's got a head on one end and nothing on the other end.

09:21.501 --> 09:23.384
And it can cause lots of damage.

09:24.206 --> 09:25.387
Let's sing another song, boys.

09:25.407 --> 09:27.030
We've got time here for about another tune.

09:27.771 --> 09:29.093
Another song, I guess, maybe.

09:29.478 --> 09:30.900
Slim's going to sing one here.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.082
One of our good friend Hank Williams' tunes.

09:33.182 --> 09:36.406
Old Hank done a good job on this, and I hope Slim can do half as good.

09:36.446 --> 09:38.048
Maybe some of you will like it out there.

09:38.669 --> 09:51.625
And anyway, here it is, and it's a tune called Mansions on the Hill.

09:51.685 --> 09:56.751
Tonight down here in the valley

09:57.946 --> 10:03.213
I'm lonesome and old how I feel.

10:04.635 --> 10:18.314
As I sit here alone in my cabin, I can see your mansion on the hill.

10:18.374 --> 10:23.481
Do you recall when we parted? The story to me you revealed?

10:29.502 --> 10:36.728
You said you could live without love, dear, in your loveless mansion on the hill.

10:36.728 --> 11:38.000
[Music.]

11:38.000 --> 11:44.919
I've waited all through the years, love

11:44.939 --> 12:07.023
To give you a heart true and real. I know you're living in sorrow on your loveless mansion on the hill. The lights shine bright from your window.

12:07.023 --> 12:29.115
The trees stand so silent and still. I know you're alone with your sorrow In your loveless mansion on the hill.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.441
Well, thank you, Slim.

12:33.481 --> 12:33.842
Thank you.

12:33.862 --> 12:34.563
There it is, friends.

12:34.603 --> 12:36.406
We hope that you've enjoyed that tune.

12:36.986 --> 12:38.629
Mansions on the Hill.

12:38.649 --> 12:40.131
You know, friends, we'd like to hear from you.

12:40.151 --> 12:41.593
We'd like to have a card or letter.

12:42.875 --> 12:47.661
Just send it to Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads in care of the station to which you're now listening.

12:47.701 --> 12:51.947
They'll send the mail on to us, and we'll get it, and it'll just tickle us to death.

12:52.007 --> 12:54.170
We'll think we're doing something grand, you know.

12:54.932 --> 12:59.558
And, boy, we'll really feel proud if you'll write to us.

13:00.179 --> 13:11.172
And you hunters and fishermen out there and you campers and all that sort of fellows, you know, hunters and fishermen, sports and all, go out on the fish bank creek and build up a little farther and fry your fish and all.

13:11.532 --> 13:12.253
Be careful with it.

13:12.273 --> 13:13.174
Rake the leaves back.

13:13.194 --> 13:15.577
And when you get ready to leave, make sure it's all out.

13:16.078 --> 13:19.762
You know, one little spark could just ruin your hunting and fishing place.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.203
And it could.

13:21.224 --> 13:22.705
Just sit down and think.

13:22.745 --> 13:23.286
Just a minute.

13:23.306 --> 13:24.267
Just stop and think a minute.

13:24.848 --> 13:27.311
And the only way to stop it, friends, is for us to stop it.

13:27.411 --> 13:27.791
Yes, sir.

13:27.811 --> 13:28.312
You and me.

13:28.672 --> 13:29.393
And we can do it.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.579
Now, we've run out of time.

13:30.599 --> 13:31.520
We're gonna have to go.

13:31.921 --> 13:38.008
But before we go, friends, I'd like to leave a little thought here for the day with all you good sportsmen out there.

13:38.709 --> 13:44.535
And it is a good sportman makes campfires work for him instead of against him.

13:44.555 --> 13:47.138
We gotta go, son.

13:47.158 --> 13:52.785
Friends, we've really enjoyed visiting with you, sitting here on the old pine tree.

13:52.805 --> 13:53.946
Now, we'll be back...

13:54.837 --> 13:58.163
Yes, sir, you just listen to the announcer, and he'll let you know just what day.

13:58.183 --> 14:00.587
We'll be waiting right here under this old pine tree for you.

14:01.328 --> 14:04.294
So be sure and come down to see us.

14:04.334 --> 14:05.616
We'd like to have you.

14:05.636 --> 14:09.623
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

14:09.623 --> 14:39.749
[Music.]

14:39.749 --> 14:47.000
[Silence.]
