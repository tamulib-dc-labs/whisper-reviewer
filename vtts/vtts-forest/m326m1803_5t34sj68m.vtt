Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear Hello there, folks.

00:14.045 --> 00:17.170
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:17.751 --> 00:22.739
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:22.759 --> 00:27.166
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:27.627 --> 00:31.253
Today, I am on my way to see Broderick Crawford.

00:33.646 --> 00:36.972
The highway patrol dispatcher said I'd find you here in this forest road, Chief.

00:37.453 --> 00:39.077
Uh-oh, there's been a fire here.

00:39.417 --> 00:40.459
Smokey, there's no doubt about it.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.022
The fire was set by a careless smoker.

00:42.403 --> 00:44.347
I saw this little fire, stopped, and stamped it out.

00:45.148 --> 00:48.094
It started from a match or a cigarette flipped from a car window.

00:48.243 --> 00:50.729
Lots of trees get killed this way, birds and animals too.

00:51.370 --> 00:53.815
Valuable watersheds are seriously damaged.

00:53.835 --> 00:56.120
We can't afford this sort of carelessness, Smokey.

00:56.140 --> 01:00.650
Seems to me we've got to put more emphasis on the importance of folks being careful with their matches and smokes.

01:00.671 --> 01:04.058
You know, maybe between us we can convince them it's better to be safe than sorry.

01:04.595 --> 01:07.879
Get more of them to use their heads when they're driving, their ashtrays when they're smoking.

01:08.099 --> 01:10.062
You've taken the words right out of my mouth, Chief.

01:10.462 --> 01:11.403
I mean, Mr. Crawford.

01:11.864 --> 01:19.073
Now, suppose you relax a bit while the sons of the pioneers here take us on a trip along Silent Trails.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.143
Silent Trails

01:27.545 --> 01:35.316
Are you lonely where you are?

01:36.057 --> 01:46.953
Do you ever get to yearning for the pioneers returning?

01:48.435 --> 01:57.147
Are the campfires still a burning silent trail?

02:00.991 --> 02:29.293
Silent trails Do the cowboys sing again Seems I hear the echoes ringing On the breezes softly wingin' Some far distant voices singin'

02:29.611 --> 02:54.673
Silent rain Shadow sway and seem to say Never gone, we're here to stay

03:00.678 --> 03:05.786
Silent trails.

03:05.806 --> 03:12.097
Do the cowboys ride again?

03:12.117 --> 03:16.484
Are the scouts ahead a-guiding?

03:18.106 --> 03:22.594
Are the redskins somewhere hiding?

03:23.976 --> 03:26.500
Are their spirits still?

03:28.960 --> 03:46.247
Silent trail.

03:46.268 --> 03:46.348
Ooh.

03:46.368 --> 03:46.588
Ooh.

03:46.648 --> 03:48.471
Silent trail.

03:52.383 --> 03:54.367
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:54.728 --> 03:57.093
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:57.113 --> 04:02.224
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:02.264 --> 04:07.776
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:08.093 --> 04:24.313
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:24.698 --> 04:33.953
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, growlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:33.973 --> 04:37.980
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:38.380 --> 04:43.028
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:50.534 --> 04:52.261
.

04:52.281 --> 04:53.304
.

04:53.325 --> 04:59.548
