00:05.347 --> 00:09.591
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:09.611 --> 00:10.812
Hello there, folks.

00:11.132 --> 00:14.395
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:14.915 --> 00:20.140
Those singing friends of mine, the sons of the pioneers, have a song for you.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.724
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:25.244 --> 00:28.867
Today, it's John Provost, and I'm meeting him at the farm.

00:31.109 --> 00:32.350
Hello, lassie.

00:32.390 --> 00:33.231
There, there.

00:33.471 --> 00:34.172
Good dogs.

00:34.557 --> 00:35.859
Where's your master?

00:35.879 --> 00:38.243
He told me you'd meet me here back in the barn.

00:38.543 --> 00:40.006
Here I am, Smokey.

00:40.026 --> 00:42.389
Did you bring me my junior force ranger card?

00:42.950 --> 00:44.853
I know the conservation pledge by heart.

00:45.494 --> 00:54.789
Listen, I give my pledge as an American to save and faithfully to defend from waste and natural resources of my country.

00:54.809 --> 00:56.151
It's soil and minerals.

00:56.873 --> 00:58.896
It's forest, water, and wildlife.

00:59.537 --> 01:00.919
There, Smokey.

01:01.253 --> 01:05.017
I'm telling everyone that comes back to the farm to be careful with their matches and smokes.

01:05.538 --> 01:08.321
We don't want any wildfires in the fields or woods around here.

01:08.421 --> 01:09.683
That's wonderful.

01:10.043 --> 01:14.068
And now, John Provost, I have your membership card right here.

01:14.568 --> 01:17.672
You're a full-fledged junior forest ranger.

01:17.992 --> 01:18.793
But don't run off.

01:19.254 --> 01:23.038
The Sons of the Pioneers are going to sing a special song for you and Lassie.

01:23.719 --> 01:26.282
It's all about when Froggy went a courtin.

01:30.886 --> 01:37.254
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did right, uh-huh.

01:37.294 --> 01:39.217
Uh-huh.

01:39.237 --> 01:48.929
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did right, a sword and pistol by his side, uh-huh.

01:51.413 --> 01:51.553
Uh-huh.

01:51.573 --> 01:51.713
Uh-huh.

01:51.912 --> 01:59.843
And he rode up to Mrs. Mouse's door.

02:00.404 --> 02:11.038
He rode up to Mrs. Mouse's door and he knocked so hard that he made it roar.

02:13.341 --> 02:16.245
Uh-huh.

02:16.906 --> 02:17.227
Uh-huh.

02:17.347 --> 02:18.308
Uh-huh.

02:20.296 --> 02:24.226
Oh, he took Mrs. Mousy on his knee.

02:26.612 --> 02:31.383
He took Mrs. Mousy on his knee.

02:32.045 --> 02:37.258
He said, Mrs. Mousy, won't you marry me?

02:37.238 --> 03:05.372
Uh-huh, uh-huh And now before I can answer that Uh-huh Uh-huh Now just before I can answer that I'll have to see my Uncle Rat Uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh

03:05.352 --> 03:12.383
Now what will the wedding supper be?

03:13.464 --> 03:14.486
Uh-huh.

03:14.506 --> 03:15.648
Uh-huh.

03:16.749 --> 03:19.654
What will the wedding supper be?

03:20.415 --> 03:24.741
Two blue beans and a black-eyed pea.

03:25.623 --> 03:28.347
Uh-huh.

03:29.508 --> 03:31.031
Uh-huh.

03:31.051 --> 03:31.191
Uh-huh.

03:32.521 --> 03:36.448
Now a little piece of cornbread lying on the shelf.

03:37.089 --> 03:44.042
A little piece of cornbread lying on the shelf.

03:44.303 --> 03:54.782
If you want any more, just sing it yourself, cause I'm hard.

04:01.883 --> 04:03.826
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:04.127 --> 04:06.611
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:06.631 --> 04:11.740
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:11.820 --> 04:17.209
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:17.459 --> 04:22.548
until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star.

04:22.949 --> 04:34.751
This is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:34.771 --> 04:39.079
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

04:39.278 --> 04:43.382
growlin' and a-growlin' and a-slip in the air.

04:43.963 --> 04:47.987
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:48.347 --> 04:52.652
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:55.815 --> 05:12.007
[Music.]
