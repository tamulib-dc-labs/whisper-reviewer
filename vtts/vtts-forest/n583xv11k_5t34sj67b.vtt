00:25.006 --> 00:33.757
Today we present Crashing Timber, the second program in a series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:34.998 --> 00:38.863
In Beaver Dam Forest, big trees are crashing down near Shuteye Ridge.

00:38.883 --> 00:47.233
The timber harvest is on, marking an important step in the proper management of a forest and the fulfillment of the cherished dream of a man now dead.

00:47.922 --> 00:54.893
Away from the loggers, near a little woods road, Ranger Bill Scott is at work measuring some logs which have been cut from the fallen trees.

00:55.433 --> 01:04.607
Helping him with log tally book in hand is Ranger Bill's pretty niece, June Cameron, neatly togged out with bright lumberjack shirt, boots and dungarees.

01:04.627 --> 01:07.652
As Ranger Bill calls out the measurements, June records them.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.411
Suddenly, the ranger's body tenses.

01:09.631 --> 01:10.813
His eyes dart quickly overhead.

01:10.833 --> 01:11.935
His voice rings out in warning.

01:11.955 --> 01:13.338
June, walk toward me.

01:13.358 --> 01:13.879
Walk fast.

01:13.899 --> 01:14.941
What is it, Uncle Bill?

01:14.961 --> 01:15.582
Do as I say.

01:15.602 --> 01:16.524
I'm coming.

01:22.034 --> 01:22.835
That's Big Lynn.

01:23.196 --> 01:24.779
It's all right where I was standing.

01:25.059 --> 01:26.742
Why, it might have hit me.

01:26.762 --> 01:29.387
You've got to be more careful, June, when you're out on a logging job.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.117
But I didn't hear a thing.

01:31.518 --> 01:33.422
How did you know it was going to fall, Uncle Bill?

01:33.442 --> 01:34.925
I heard it crack or sensed it, maybe.

01:35.285 --> 01:38.612
At any rate, something made me look up and there was that widow maker teetering up there.

01:38.833 --> 01:39.955
Widow maker?

01:39.975 --> 01:44.524
Yes, that's what the lumberjacks call those big old dead limbs or branches that often break loose as this one did.

01:44.926 --> 01:48.830
The lumberjacks claim that they make more widows than anything else in this dangerous logging business.

01:48.990 --> 01:53.055
Golly, before I stand under a tree again, I'm going to look up every time.

01:53.615 --> 01:56.959
There'll be no widows in my family because of my carelessness.

01:56.979 --> 01:59.802
So no husband of yours is ever going to be a widow, huh, June?

02:00.383 --> 02:05.068
No, seriously, it's a good idea to keep your eyes and ears wide open when you're out in the woods.

02:05.088 --> 02:08.031
Uncle Bill, shouldn't those two boys be here by now?

02:08.112 --> 02:14.280
Joe and Sam, I reckon they didn't finish washing those breakfast dishes at the boys' camp as quickly as they expected.

02:14.300 --> 02:14.840
They'll be along.

02:15.021 --> 02:16.763
I hope they don't get lost again.

02:16.783 --> 02:17.544
They shouldn't.

02:17.564 --> 02:18.986
I told them exactly how to get here.

02:19.566 --> 02:21.248
Well, suppose we finish this job here.

02:21.849 --> 02:24.012
Just one more big log to scale, this one.

02:24.032 --> 02:25.934
What we're doing, then, is scaling logs.

02:26.415 --> 02:28.578
I want to remember that for the kids at school.

02:28.618 --> 02:33.924
Putting it more simply, June, what we're doing is measuring the good or sound wood in these logs.

02:33.944 --> 02:36.988
You know, that's what the buyer of this timber pays for, the sound wood only.

02:37.576 --> 02:39.760
Now, this log is 16 feet long.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.546
The diameter up here at the top is 36 inches.

02:43.566 --> 02:45.209
And not a bit of rot showing anywhere.

02:45.529 --> 02:46.931
Length, 16 feet.

02:47.653 --> 02:49.175
Diameter, 36 inches.

02:49.195 --> 02:49.556
That's it.

02:50.437 --> 02:54.504
The scale table shows contents in board feet, 920.

02:55.045 --> 02:55.526
Right.

02:55.546 --> 02:56.667
Now, put that down in your book.

02:57.128 --> 02:59.432
920 board feet.

02:59.952 --> 03:00.993
Let's see now.

03:01.013 --> 03:02.454
You told me what a bored foot is.

03:03.095 --> 03:03.235
Mm-hmm.

03:03.255 --> 03:03.715
Oh, yes.

03:04.216 --> 03:12.343
A bored foot is a unit of measure equivalent to a section of wood one foot long, one foot wide, and one inch thick.

03:12.423 --> 03:13.064
Good girl.

03:13.304 --> 03:18.488
Golly, Uncle Bill, if the wood in this log could be rolled out straight, why, let's see now.

03:19.109 --> 03:23.533
That would make a one-inch board, one foot wide, and 920 feet long.

03:23.813 --> 03:26.415
Why, that's more than one-sixth of a mile long.

03:26.616 --> 03:28.137
And that's quite a board, isn't it, June?

03:28.522 --> 03:33.246
Now, the truth is that this log will be sawed into a number of boards of different sizes and different lengths.

03:34.087 --> 03:39.292
Boards that'll find a ready use as the sides of a house, maybe, or tabletops, or the shelves in the kitchen.

03:39.492 --> 03:41.094
You sound mighty pleased, Uncle Bill.

03:41.434 --> 03:42.355
I am pleased, June.

03:42.955 --> 03:46.939
You know, there's a lot of satisfaction in scaling a bunch of logs as big and nice as these are.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.443
Because here's proof that protection and good handling of a forest pays off.

03:53.125 --> 03:56.368
You know, old Pat Bond, if he was still alive, he'd be pleased as punch.

03:56.905 --> 03:57.666
Pat Bond?

03:57.946 --> 03:58.988
Who is he, Uncle Bill?

03:59.188 --> 04:01.471
A man I owe more to than any man I've ever met, June.

04:02.071 --> 04:07.058
And I want to tell you about him sometime, but I'd like to save that story until Joe and Sam get here.

04:07.078 --> 04:07.518
Okay with you?

04:07.738 --> 04:08.980
Okay, Uncle Bill.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.842
But where in the world are those boys?

04:10.962 --> 04:11.824
You've got me, June.

04:12.264 --> 04:13.666
Say, I wonder if... What, Uncle Bill?

04:14.026 --> 04:16.209
Well, you know, they might be up where the loggers are at work.

04:16.249 --> 04:18.872
They probably got so interested they couldn't pull themselves away.

04:19.373 --> 04:20.114
Why, of course.

04:20.354 --> 04:21.636
That's exactly what happened.

04:21.696 --> 04:22.557
Well, come on, then.

04:22.937 --> 04:25.140
I don't want those two young explorers getting underfoot.

04:36.933 --> 04:38.835
Hi there!

04:39.216 --> 04:39.556
Sam!

04:39.997 --> 04:40.758
Hello, Ranger Bill.

04:41.258 --> 04:43.000
Golly, this is really something, isn't it?

04:43.020 --> 04:43.902
By the way, where's Joe?

04:43.982 --> 04:44.943
Oh, he's around somewhere.

04:45.143 --> 04:47.586
I thought I told you two boys to meet me down at the Woods Road.

04:47.606 --> 04:49.549
Gee, Ranger Bill, we were heading that way, honest.

04:49.909 --> 04:52.652
And then we saw all this stuff going on... Okay, okay, Sam.

04:53.413 --> 04:57.158
I swear you youngsters are harder to ride herd on than a thousand long horn steers.

04:57.639 --> 05:00.522
I reckon I'll just have to keep an eagle eye on you every minute that you're here.

05:00.542 --> 05:01.303
How about your niece, Ranger Bill?

05:01.621 --> 05:03.263
She came out here with you today, didn't she?

05:03.283 --> 05:03.963
That's right, Sam.

05:04.484 --> 05:06.025
She's back a ways there, out of danger.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.167
Oh, yes, I see her now.

05:08.187 --> 05:08.748
Good gravy.

05:09.188 --> 05:10.589
There's that tree falling the wrong way.

05:11.110 --> 05:12.091
June, get out of there.

05:12.111 --> 05:12.791
Run, girl, run.

05:12.871 --> 05:13.292
She heard you.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.173
She's running, Ranger Bill.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.434
She'll never make it.

05:15.474 --> 05:15.934
Holy cat.

05:16.355 --> 05:17.115
Look, there's June.

05:17.496 --> 05:18.216
Running toward June.

05:18.597 --> 05:19.197
Look, Ranger Bill.

05:19.217 --> 05:19.878
He's diving at her.

05:20.338 --> 05:21.639
Man, oh, man, what a tackle.

05:21.800 --> 05:22.540
We've got to get to them.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.121
Come on, Sam.

05:24.822 --> 05:25.043
June.

05:25.563 --> 05:26.244
June, where are you?

05:27.205 --> 05:27.565
Here, Uncle Bill.

05:27.585 --> 05:28.586
I'm here in the clear.

05:28.786 --> 05:29.066
Come here.

05:29.086 --> 05:29.987
Let me help you up, June.

05:30.648 --> 05:30.868
Oh, thanks.

05:31.810 --> 05:32.091
There.

05:32.611 --> 05:33.233
You all right, girl?

05:33.794 --> 05:34.695
Thank you, Uncle Bill.

05:35.276 --> 05:35.958
I think so.

05:36.358 --> 05:37.841
Just a bit shaky, that's all.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.364
It'll go away.

05:39.384 --> 05:40.085
What happened to Joe?

05:40.706 --> 05:41.728
Right here, Ranger Bill.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.411
Oh, that was nice going, son.

05:43.431 --> 05:44.253
Thank you, sir.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.998
I appreciate what you did, Joe.

05:47.579 --> 05:48.280
That's okay.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.763
Say, that tackle was a honey, Joe.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.106
By the way, June, this is Sam.

05:51.226 --> 05:51.847
Hello, Sam.

05:51.887 --> 05:52.468
Hello, June.

05:53.292 --> 05:56.996
Now that you two know each other, suppose we get out of here where these men can go back to work.

05:57.276 --> 05:59.859
I think you've had just about enough of logging close up.

05:59.879 --> 06:02.602
Oh, you're not going to take us back to camp right now, are you, Ranger Bill?

06:02.622 --> 06:05.044
Gosh, we were hoping you'd tell us something about the logging.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.887
Yes, Uncle Bill, and that story about Pat Vaughn, remember?

06:08.167 --> 06:08.988
Well, take it easy.

06:09.008 --> 06:10.810
Just a little bit of patience.

06:10.830 --> 06:14.354
Now, we're going up on Shuteye Ridge, where we'll be well out of the way of any falling tree.

06:14.954 --> 06:16.556
There's something up there I want you to see.

06:19.939 --> 06:21.561
The End

06:22.267 --> 06:37.008
Well, here we are, Shuteye Ridge.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.431
How do you like it, the view and all?

06:39.451 --> 06:41.254
Oh, it's beautiful, Uncle Bill.

06:41.274 --> 06:41.674
Swell.

06:41.694 --> 06:44.859
Gosh, look at all the trees down there where we just came from.

06:44.879 --> 06:47.763
You'd never know that they were cutting timber in there right now.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.405
That's a pretty good observation, Sam.

06:49.857 --> 06:54.703
It kind of proves, doesn't it, that when it comes to managing a forest, you can have your cake and eat it, too.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.387
Because that's what's happening here in Viva Dam Forest.

06:58.407 --> 07:01.050
I wish the same could be said for all of our American forests.

07:01.070 --> 07:02.792
Our American Forest.

07:02.812 --> 07:04.974
Sounds like a title of a book, doesn't it, Uncle Bill?

07:05.555 --> 07:07.397
Well, come to think of it, June, it is.

07:07.417 --> 07:11.902
There is a book called Our American Forest that tells a pretty good story about the woods.

07:11.922 --> 07:14.766
In fact, you can find it in the library back home.

07:14.786 --> 07:16.067
Now, where were we?

07:16.199 --> 07:20.424
You were saying that it's possible to cut trees down and still keep the forest growing.

07:20.824 --> 07:20.964
Mm-hmm.

07:20.984 --> 07:22.046
Oh, yes.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.610
You see, a lot of timbermen were handling their forests fine.

07:25.630 --> 07:27.272
However, a lot more aren't.

07:28.373 --> 07:31.436
Too many of our forest woodlands are still being hacked and slashed.

07:31.997 --> 07:35.020
Those forests won't produce any more wood for years and years to come.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.504
I read somewhere that there's a lumber shortage in our country right now.

07:39.065 --> 07:40.026
Is that true, Ranger Bill?

07:40.266 --> 07:40.867
Yes, Sam.

07:41.027 --> 07:41.768
Sadly so.

07:42.305 --> 07:47.009
We Americans are still cutting and still letting forest fires burn our timber faster than it grows.

07:47.890 --> 07:50.193
Of course, that's the broad national picture.

07:50.213 --> 07:53.636
But here in Beaver Dam Forest, our plans just don't allow such waste.

07:54.397 --> 08:01.083
We do everything we can to protect the timber against fire, against disease and insects, and against careless and bad cutting practices.

08:01.363 --> 08:05.767
And some of those loggers down there told me that you could cut only those trees that are marked for cutting.

08:06.048 --> 08:07.509
Is that part of the plan, Ranger Bill?

08:07.549 --> 08:08.450
Yes, that's right, Joe.

08:09.131 --> 08:10.692
We call that selective logging.

08:10.958 --> 08:15.602
In most cases, it's the best guarantee that the forest will be left in good growing condition.

08:15.622 --> 08:18.124
Well, how do you know which trees to select for Cutting Ranger, Bill?

08:18.225 --> 08:19.726
Well, that's part of my job, Sam.

08:19.886 --> 08:24.210
You usually mark the big old trees that have grown all they're going to, don't you, Uncle Bill?

08:24.550 --> 08:26.252
Yes, I mark the mature timber, June.

08:26.652 --> 08:30.015
Trees that are fully ripe and ought to be out of here before decay sets in.

08:30.616 --> 08:32.898
But, of course, I mark other trees, too.

08:32.918 --> 08:35.320
Those that are diseased or have been injured in some way.

08:35.820 --> 08:38.923
Because it improves the forest to take such weak or sick trees out.

08:39.595 --> 08:43.420
After they're gone, the remaining trees get more light and moisture and they grow better.

08:43.580 --> 08:45.703
Survival of the fittest, eh, Ranger Bill?

08:45.723 --> 08:46.484
In a way, Joe.

08:47.124 --> 08:55.635
The main objective, of course, is to leave the young, good-growing trees so that they can put on their full growth and someday help provide the fine, clear lumber that we need so badly.

08:55.655 --> 08:59.219
Uncle Bill, where does that man you mentioned, Pat Bond, fit into all of this?

08:59.379 --> 09:02.043
Yeah, Ranger Bill, who was this Pat Bond fella?

09:02.203 --> 09:07.389
Well, before we have the story, suppose we sit down here on the ground and get comfortable.

09:08.771 --> 09:09.552
Well, that's better.

09:10.190 --> 09:12.332
Now I'll tell you all about Pat Bond.

09:12.352 --> 09:16.537
But first, how would you youngsters like to see the logs that they're cutting down there go to the mill next week?

09:16.677 --> 09:17.918
Oh, gee, I like that.

09:17.938 --> 09:18.819
Okay, then.

09:18.839 --> 09:21.042
We'll plan on that trip to the sawmill next week.

09:21.062 --> 09:25.206
And since we'll be going past Beaver Dam Lake, I think that you better bring along your swimming togs.

09:25.567 --> 09:26.948
We might have time for a little swim.

09:27.729 --> 09:28.250
Oh, that's nice.

09:28.270 --> 09:30.652
Well, and you can come in on this party, too, June, if you like.

09:30.893 --> 09:33.876
Just try and keep me from going, Uncle Bill.

09:33.896 --> 09:35.097
All right, then.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.879
Now I suppose you want to hear about Pat Bond.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.522
Well, just about 25 years ago...

09:40.075 --> 09:44.781
Pat Bond brought me up on this little ridge just as I've brought you here today.

09:44.801 --> 09:49.368
We'd spent most of the day marking and scaling lumber on that very same area that's being logged now.

09:49.528 --> 09:54.234
Oh, then some of the trees those loggers are cutting down now were trees you left to grow big way back then.

09:54.335 --> 09:55.016
That's right, Joe.

09:55.817 --> 10:02.946
This is our second cutting operation in here, and it's all happening just exactly the way Pat Bond predicted it would.

10:02.966 --> 10:05.971
You see, Pat Bond was the first Beaver Dam Ranger.

10:05.991 --> 10:07.753
He surveyed the land for this public forest,

10:08.138 --> 10:14.385
He built the first roads and trails in here, the first telephone lines, and the very first crude fire lookout towers.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.247
He made up the first plans for cutting the timber.

10:16.828 --> 10:18.790
In fact, plans that I'm using to this very day.

10:19.611 --> 10:22.274
You see, I worked with him in those early days as his assistant.

10:22.294 --> 10:26.278
You said that Pat Bond predicted all this would happen, just as it is happening.

10:27.099 --> 10:28.401
How do you know that, Uncle Bill?

10:28.861 --> 10:37.791
Well, as we stood here on that day long ago, Pat turned to me, and in his rough, easy manner of talking, he said... Bill...

10:38.800 --> 10:43.547
There ain't a tree anywhere in this world that ain't worth something to somebody.

10:43.567 --> 10:52.641
There ain't even a fire scorch tree or a wormy tree or a crooked limmy tree anywhere that don't have some value of one kind or another for someone.

10:52.661 --> 10:59.611
You know, Bill, when folks realize that, they'll be more apt to appreciate good, sound trees when they have them.

10:59.631 --> 11:03.137
Folks have got to learn to protect the forest, take care of them, use them right.

11:04.058 --> 11:07.423
And that's why I'm so keen about the timber we're looking at down there.

11:07.977 --> 11:13.702
I kind of feel like I've had a chance to practice what I've been preaching since I got into this forestry service.

11:14.743 --> 11:23.411
You know, in 25 years or so, some beaver dam ranger, maybe you, Bill, will be supervising another timber cutting right here on that same land.

11:23.431 --> 11:24.792
And it'll be better timber.

11:25.173 --> 11:27.675
Better timber than you're marking and scaling right now.

11:28.456 --> 11:30.057
Now, you mark my word, Bill.

11:30.978 --> 11:31.639
Mark my word.

11:32.319 --> 11:34.001
He was right, wasn't he, Uncle Bill?

11:34.401 --> 11:35.442
In everything he said.

11:35.662 --> 11:36.583
Yes, Joan, he was.

11:36.935 --> 11:38.757
What happened to him, Ranger Bill?

11:38.777 --> 11:41.601
I told you there was something I wanted you to see up here on Shuteye Ridge.

11:42.543 --> 11:45.927
Now, do you see that old stone right beside you there, Sam?

11:45.947 --> 11:47.930
Oh, gee, it's just a big rock.

11:47.950 --> 11:49.993
Now, wait, there's something carved on the side.

11:50.373 --> 11:51.635
Go ahead, read it, Sam.

11:52.456 --> 11:53.397
Pat Bond.

11:54.379 --> 11:57.082
Here he lies where he longed to be.

11:57.803 --> 11:59.786
Yes, that's right.

11:59.806 --> 12:03.651
Pat Bond was killed in a forest fire here in Beaver Dam Forest about ten years ago.

12:04.711 --> 12:07.954
It was his final request that his remains be brought to this spot.

12:07.974 --> 12:11.097
Incidentally, Pat gave Shut-Eye Ridge its name the day we were up here together.

12:11.798 --> 12:21.067
Well, I helped bury Pat here under that simple stone, and that's all he wanted after a mighty full and valuable life in forest conservation.

12:21.788 --> 12:25.111
Here he lied where he longed to be.

12:25.131 --> 12:29.095
Pat borrowed his simple little epitaph from Robert Louis Stevenson's poem, Requiem, June.

12:30.577 --> 12:33.179
I don't think Stevenson would have minded.

12:33.199 --> 12:34.060
How does it go now?

12:35.339 --> 12:36.541
Something like this, wasn't it?

12:38.704 --> 12:43.251
Under the wide and starry sky, dig the grave, let me lie.

12:44.253 --> 12:49.742
Glad that I live and gladly die, and I laid me down with a will.

12:49.762 --> 12:51.264
This be the verse you grave for me.

12:52.586 --> 12:55.491
Here he lies where he longed to be.

12:55.511 --> 13:00.739
Home as the sailor, home from the sea, and the hunter, home from the hill.

13:01.647 --> 13:04.510
That was beautiful, Uncle Bill.

13:04.530 --> 13:07.895
Now, no reason for sadness, Joan.

13:08.315 --> 13:10.538
I don't think Pat would have wanted it that way.

13:10.558 --> 13:16.285
Let's just think of him as, well, as a good soldier who died in the defense of his country's forest.

13:16.565 --> 13:18.888
I guess that goes for all forest rangers.

13:18.908 --> 13:23.653
They're good soldiers, all right, protecting our homes by protecting the forests.

13:23.673 --> 13:27.218
Protecting us, you might say, because the forests mean so much to all of us.

13:27.758 --> 13:29.140
Good to hear you say that, Joan.

13:30.267 --> 13:30.888
Mighty good.

13:49.487 --> 13:57.035
You have just heard the second in a series of programs on forest conservation with Bill Scott, forest ranger.

13:57.055 --> 13:59.818
Now, boys and girls, if you have a pencil and paper handy...

14:00.153 --> 14:03.016
I'll give you the name of the book suggested by Ranger Bill.

14:03.677 --> 14:07.761
Here it is, Our American Forests by Catherine Glover.

14:08.542 --> 14:09.183
How'd you get that?

14:09.904 --> 14:13.307
Our American Forests by Catherine Glover.

14:14.328 --> 14:18.053
Next week, our story will be about A Storm Over the Forest.

14:18.073 --> 14:23.739
Bill Scott, Forest Ranger, comes to you with a cooperation of the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture.

14:24.099 --> 14:29.485
The script for Bill Scott is written by Bill Berghoffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokamp.

14:29.701 --> 14:33.028
Your announcer is Bob Geist.
