WEBVTT

00:08.924 --> 00:17.016
Well, howdy, friends.

00:18.038 --> 00:20.962
Joe Woodrider, Jelly Elliott, and the Three Knot Head.

00:20.982 --> 00:22.805
We'd like for you to come in and set a spell.

00:22.825 --> 00:25.689
We're gonna pick and sing a few songs here for you.

00:25.709 --> 00:27.972
We'll be with you for the next 14 and a half minutes.

00:28.513 --> 00:34.282
Brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your state forest of service and Uncle Sam's forest of service.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.986
So just pull up a chair and make yourself at home.

00:37.046 --> 00:38.408
Hell yeah!

00:39.012 --> 00:43.942
Friends, we're going to be with you the next 14 and a half minutes, so that's a pretty good time.

00:44.022 --> 00:48.791
You might not like this mess to start with, but just stay with us, and you might get to like it.

00:48.851 --> 00:54.542
So pull up a chair, take it to the back of there, and get comfortable, pull off your shoes, and make yourself at home.

00:54.843 --> 00:58.911
I'm going to tell you who all the boys are to start things off here, so there won't be no argument about that.

00:59.178 --> 01:02.301
I'll start off with the boy over here who plays the steel guitar.

01:02.361 --> 01:02.761
Yes, sir.

01:03.142 --> 01:05.864
That's the only boy Ms.

01:05.924 --> 01:07.206
Anderson's got named Deacon.

01:07.226 --> 01:08.187
That's Deacon Anderson.

01:08.227 --> 01:08.547
Deacon.

01:09.968 --> 01:11.029
That's him.

01:11.049 --> 01:13.932
And back over here, this fine-looking young man here.

01:14.493 --> 01:15.153
Plays the fiddle.

01:15.434 --> 01:16.014
Plays the fiddle.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.656
He had a hard time getting his fiddle friends.

01:18.036 --> 01:23.501
That boy sold garden seeds from house to house all over the country and saved up coupons and got this fiddle.

01:23.802 --> 01:25.303
And here he is, Robert Shivers.

01:26.870 --> 01:28.812
Ain't that awful?

01:29.393 --> 01:33.959
And then back over here, this fellow back here behind me, old High Pockets.

01:34.460 --> 01:36.542
Yeah, Mr. Long Distance, that is.

01:36.983 --> 01:39.446
That's my right-handed, left-handed man.

01:39.466 --> 01:42.029
Yeah, we call him Slim because he's short.

01:42.049 --> 01:42.910
I mean, he's tall.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.332
His name is Tommy.

01:44.352 --> 01:45.173
Tommy what, Slim?

01:46.375 --> 01:49.399
Yeah, Slim plays the rhythm guitar, and he does all the opera singing in the band.

01:49.419 --> 01:56.067
Here's the first tune, features Robert, and he's tried a potato fiddle, a little diddy called Violin Cabbage Down.

02:36.277 --> 02:39.601
Well, all right, Robert, thank you there, buddy.

02:39.621 --> 02:42.065
That was called, Buy Them Cabbage Down.

02:42.085 --> 02:44.528
I know a lot of you old-timers out there remember that old tune.

02:45.269 --> 02:47.332
Now, friends, we're going to be here on this same station.

02:47.913 --> 02:52.619
We're going to be here on this same station for a period of, I guess, about 13 weeks.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.321
You reckon you can stand it, 13 weeks?

02:54.802 --> 02:58.327
It's bad, I know, but that's the way it is.

02:58.367 --> 02:59.348
13 weeks.

02:59.665 --> 03:01.387
Now, we'd like to hear from you.

03:01.407 --> 03:02.989
A penny postcard or a letter will do it.

03:03.229 --> 03:10.637
Just sit down, write us a penny postcard or a letter, send it to the station that you're now listening to, and we'll just be tickled to death to hear from you.

03:11.638 --> 03:14.422
And we're going to dish out a few of these old corny hillbilly tunes.

03:14.442 --> 03:18.286
Some of them good, some of them ain't so good, and some of them worse than that.

03:18.306 --> 03:21.810
And we've got a few stories to tell about things in general out in the woods.

03:22.390 --> 03:23.492
And you know the woods.

03:23.512 --> 03:25.914
Speaking of the woods, that's a place we all love.

03:25.934 --> 03:27.716
That's a place we all love.

03:27.736 --> 03:29.098
That's a place we all love.

03:29.078 --> 03:35.070
Ooh, that's the place we all love.

03:35.130 --> 03:48.758
Everybody loves the woods.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.185
That's funny, but they do.

03:51.205 --> 03:57.582
I guess everybody's got a certain amount of animal instinct in him or something because he loves to get out in the woods.

03:57.722 --> 04:00.329
In fact, we live in the woods, don't we?

04:00.770 --> 04:00.871
Yeah.

04:00.891 --> 04:02.515
And it's mighty fine, though, I tell you.

04:02.535 --> 04:03.658
Here's another tune.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.142
Well, you ain't doing nothing there, if y'all don't care.

04:07.004 --> 04:08.185
I was going to sing, wasn't I?

04:08.225 --> 04:09.046
Yeah, that's right.

04:09.226 --> 04:13.172
I'm going to sing, friends, so don't hold it against me, though.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.074
We get lots of requests for this old tune.

04:15.595 --> 04:20.541
Our good friend Cotton Thompson wrote this tune, and I believe Luke Wills published it, didn't he?

04:20.561 --> 04:21.062
Is that right?

04:21.082 --> 04:22.083
Yeah, Luke did, uh-huh.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.428
And here it is, Somebody Bring Your Milk Bucket, I'm Now Going to Pale Old Pied.

04:25.488 --> 04:28.632
It's a Jersey Blues of Milk Cavaliers.

04:28.652 --> 04:28.752
Music

04:53.993 --> 05:20.203
I look out door I can tell my milk eye I can tell the way she knows If you see my milk eye She's driving her own home Well I ain't had no milking but since my cow's been gone Well you've got to treat me right

05:20.690 --> 05:46.039

06:18.149 --> 06:21.052
Well, my baby caught a train.

06:21.072 --> 06:25.758
She left me a mule to ride.

06:25.778 --> 06:26.399
That old Toby.

06:26.959 --> 06:29.663
Well, my baby caught a choo-choo.

06:29.683 --> 06:35.810
She left me a donkey to ride.

06:35.830 --> 06:41.997
And when the train left the station, that old jazz zag lay down and died.

06:45.436 --> 06:46.797
That's their mule train.

06:46.897 --> 06:47.438
That was.

06:47.478 --> 06:49.099
I just had one of the mules, though.

06:49.940 --> 06:52.602
Friends, that was the Jersey blues, the milk cow blues.

06:52.622 --> 06:55.304
If you like it, well, write to us, and we'll be glad to do it again.

06:55.865 --> 06:56.165
Try.

06:56.185 --> 07:00.068
There's about 101 verses of that thing, and I'll try to do more of them next time.

07:01.189 --> 07:05.053
Now, friends, you know what the woods means to all of us.

07:05.073 --> 07:07.355
It just means so much.

07:07.455 --> 07:10.037
Just stop and think what all it does mean.

07:10.177 --> 07:12.659
Jobs and homes and everything.

07:12.679 --> 07:15.021
Pulpwood, salt timber, turpentine.

07:15.338 --> 07:17.421
And all sorts of byproducts.

07:17.661 --> 07:18.322
Dynamite.

07:18.342 --> 07:19.764
You take old pine stumps.

07:19.784 --> 07:22.608
You've got the use for pine stumps.

07:22.628 --> 07:25.592
If they don't catch fire and burn up out there in the woods.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.634
You can make all kinds of stuff out of them.

07:27.814 --> 07:34.563
Watershed protection for the water for drinking and bathing and swimming and fishing and hunting.

07:35.224 --> 07:35.985
All camping.

07:36.025 --> 07:36.786
Wildlife.

07:36.987 --> 07:37.347
Deer.

07:37.447 --> 07:37.968
Quail.

07:38.048 --> 07:38.569
Squirrels.

07:38.589 --> 07:39.049
Turkeys.

07:39.069 --> 07:39.430
Fish.

07:39.530 --> 07:41.132
All that sort of stuff.

07:41.332 --> 07:43.575
Good grazing when it's handled right, of course.

07:43.595 --> 07:44.296
Got behind you.

07:44.456 --> 07:44.957
Of course.

07:45.376 --> 07:58.291
But it is, and it's just so pretty in the spring of the year you get out there when all the bushes is budding out and the buds is budding and the dogwoods is wooden and everything.

07:58.392 --> 08:00.234
It's just as pretty as it could be.

08:00.294 --> 08:06.281
I love to get out in the woods and get full of seed ticks and then scratch all the rest of the week.

08:06.301 --> 08:07.262
That's the most fun.

08:07.883 --> 08:14.691
Friends, that all sounds fine, and it is fine, if we just don't let fire mess up the whole work.

08:15.177 --> 08:16.358
like it does so often.

08:16.979 --> 08:18.781
You just got to watch that, that's all there is to it.

08:18.801 --> 08:20.704
Slim's gonna sing a song for you here, friend.

08:20.724 --> 08:21.024
Slim.

08:21.325 --> 08:23.988
Old, long, tall, icky, bod, crane-looking character here.

08:24.348 --> 08:26.371
He's gonna give forth with his sad little ditty.

08:26.591 --> 08:28.193
He sings all the tear-jerkers, friend.

08:28.213 --> 08:30.015
So get out your wheat rag, John.

08:30.035 --> 08:30.956
Get ready to squall.

08:30.976 --> 08:34.541
Slim's fixing to give forth here with... Yeah, poor fella.

08:34.821 --> 08:36.443
I wish I had a nickel.

08:40.507 --> 08:45.234
Tell me, little darling, that tomorrow you'll be wet.

08:45.254 --> 08:49.600
You thought that you would hurt me, but you hurt yourself instead.

08:50.040 --> 08:54.286
I'll always be the same, old pal, just as the days gone by.

08:54.747 --> 08:59.434
Just sit back and watch you while you sit alone and cry.

08:59.454 --> 09:02.498
Gears falling down your pretty

09:05.060 --> 09:12.591
There are tears of sorrow and tears of delight.

09:13.152 --> 09:17.739
Wish I had a nickel for every tear you shed last night.

09:17.759 --> 09:21.704
I just dropped by to tell you that I wish you happiness.

09:22.386 --> 09:27.173
I hope that you'll forgive me for intruding like this.

09:27.193 --> 09:30.898
Hope, my dear, your happiness will follow through the years.

09:31.655 --> 09:37.363
You sit back and watch you while you shed your bitter tears.

09:37.383 --> 09:40.968
Tears falling down your pretty cheek.

09:40.988 --> 09:45.615
Tears you cannot hide and tears you cannot keep.

09:45.635 --> 09:49.821
There are tears of sorrow and tears of your life.

09:50.302 --> 09:56.851
Wish I had a nickel, baby, tears you shed last night.

09:57.913 --> 09:58.493
Thank you, Slim.

09:58.513 --> 09:58.894
Thank you.

09:59.330 --> 09:59.871
There it is.

09:59.971 --> 10:01.414
I wish I had the nickel.

10:01.474 --> 10:04.419
I wish I had one too, Slim, and then we'd have a dime, wouldn't we, buddy?

10:04.900 --> 10:07.866
Yeah, boy, we'd have a dime.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.691
You know, that's a funny thing.

10:11.232 --> 10:13.997
I just love to stand up here and...

10:14.247 --> 10:18.171
Show meggers and pick and sing these old corny songs if you like them.

10:18.431 --> 10:22.615
And the only way we're going to know whether you like them or not, friends, is for you to write to us.

10:22.635 --> 10:27.019
Write us a penny postcard or letter in care of the station that you're now listening to.

10:27.039 --> 10:28.300
I'll tell you who you address it to.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.502
Address it to Jelly Elliott and the three knotheads.

10:31.182 --> 10:32.443
Ain't that something, knotheads?

10:32.463 --> 10:33.164
Well, that's us.

10:33.504 --> 10:34.385
That's us, all right.

10:35.006 --> 10:38.169
Every one of our heads look like a sack of hickernuts right now.

10:38.189 --> 10:40.731
You know, boys, it'll soon be hickernut time, too, won't it?

10:41.371 --> 10:43.073
I sure will be glad, too, Costa.

10:43.407 --> 10:47.092
Maybe my wife will get some new ones to put in that pillar I've been sleeping on.

10:47.172 --> 10:49.935
All the hoes is off of them I'm sleeping on now.

10:49.955 --> 10:51.718
And I'll like that.

10:52.058 --> 10:53.440
You know I'm from out of the wind?

10:54.902 --> 10:56.103
No, the wind's out of me.

10:56.444 --> 10:57.425
Yeah.

10:57.926 --> 10:59.448
I think I'm ballast.

10:59.468 --> 10:59.808
Yeah.

11:00.229 --> 11:00.669
Or something.

11:01.310 --> 11:04.875
Yeah, friends, we're going to do another tune here.

11:04.915 --> 11:05.636
Robert.

11:05.656 --> 11:07.919
Robert, he's a Romeo Robert.

11:07.939 --> 11:09.060
That's a coconut boy.

11:09.462 --> 11:11.845
Yeah, he's got to swallow that gum.

11:12.165 --> 11:13.767
Boy, you chewing bubble gum again?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.369
You cut that out.

11:15.389 --> 11:18.292
You know you ain't gonna be chewing bubble gum up here like that.

11:18.853 --> 11:19.694
Swallow that gum.

11:19.734 --> 11:20.735
Come on up here and sing.

11:21.075 --> 11:22.137
Hey, you made it?

11:22.177 --> 11:23.098
Yeah.

11:23.118 --> 11:25.380
He's gonna sing one of them sticky tunes, friends.

11:25.400 --> 11:25.861
Here it is.

11:26.321 --> 11:31.167
Robert messed around and got stuck, so he's gonna sing, Thorns in My Heart.

11:35.078 --> 11:46.624
thorn was left in my heart bow rose of fragrance and beauty divine a thorn was left in my heart

11:49.625 --> 11:54.212
Oh man, someone else got the rose.

11:54.472 --> 11:59.340
I got the thorn, now its fragrance is just a memory.

11:59.480 --> 12:06.030
A thorn was left in my heart by rose, whose love was never made.

12:08.744 --> 12:24.624
A thorn was left in my heart by a rose Causing tears to fall like the rain A thorn was left in my heart by a rose Who's leaving left sorrow and pain?

12:24.944 --> 12:35.157
Someone else got the rose I got the thorn, now its fragrance is just a memory

12:38.039 --> 12:43.387
love was never meant for me.

12:43.407 --> 12:44.328
Well, thank you, Robert.

12:44.348 --> 12:44.689
Thank you.

12:44.709 --> 12:45.510
There it is, friends.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.254
The thorn was left in my heart by a rose.

12:48.575 --> 12:58.710
You know, friends, as I told you a while ago, I insist on you writing to us because, like I told you, we're just starting and we'll be here for about 13 weeks.

12:58.730 --> 13:07.843
Now, you can listen to your announcer when we go off of the wind here and he'll let you know just what day we'll be back, what time and all that sort of stuff and things and all and

13:08.144 --> 13:10.067
We'd like to have you listen.

13:10.127 --> 13:22.969
If you're busy down there in the new ground or something, well, you can come to the house and get a fresh drink of water and a cool drink and maybe have coffee and sit there and listen to us blow our top here for about 14 and a half minutes and go back.

13:23.009 --> 13:25.293
You can do a lot better job and everything.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.857
And we might say something up here that you'd like to hear.

13:27.877 --> 13:28.458
Can't tell.

13:28.939 --> 13:33.747
We got a lot of interesting things to talk to you about here a little later on.

13:34.165 --> 13:39.112
future programs and everything, but we just want to get acquainted with all you friends out there right now.

13:39.132 --> 13:41.476
So tune us in there every day.

13:41.556 --> 13:46.663
We'll try not to blow no fuses or bust no cogs or nothing like that in your radio.

13:47.044 --> 13:49.027
Of course, it's a lot to happen.

13:49.067 --> 13:54.074
This is an unrehearsed, unpredictable program, I'll tell you before we start.

13:54.695 --> 13:55.856
Anything can happen.

13:56.197 --> 13:59.261
We've messed around here and run out of time this time.

13:59.281 --> 14:03.868
Just this time now, we've run out of time, and we're going to have to move along because

14:04.220 --> 14:06.483
We've got to get on back out there in the woods.

14:06.503 --> 14:09.066
And, you see, I'm the old wood rider.

14:09.526 --> 14:12.269
Jelly Elliott, that's me, the wood rider, and I've got to get out there.

14:12.329 --> 14:20.238
I tell you, I just feel plumb, plumb unnecessary unless I'm out there in the woods fooling around, peeping in old hollow logs and things.

14:20.278 --> 14:21.760
Might find a nice fat possum.

14:21.780 --> 14:22.361
You can't tell.

14:22.721 --> 14:25.845
Friends, before we go, I'd just like to leave a little thought for the day with you.

14:26.506 --> 14:26.906
Yes, sir.

14:27.267 --> 14:31.271
When using a match, just use your head.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.693
Break it in two.

14:32.713 --> 14:33.754
Be sure it's dead.

14:34.409 --> 14:37.195
dead out.

14:37.215 --> 14:41.245
Friends, we've really enjoyed being with you for the last 14 and a half minutes, and we'll be back.

14:41.265 --> 14:46.998
Just listen to your station announcer, and he'll let you know, and write us a penny postcard or a letter.

14:47.018 --> 14:51.608
And remember, friends, only you can prevent wood spires.
