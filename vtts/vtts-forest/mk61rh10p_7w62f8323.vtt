00:00.000 --> 00:17.193
[Silence.]

00:17.193 --> 00:29.550
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:29.931 --> 00:31.733
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:31.753 --> 00:33.556
That was how we got his name.

00:34.216 --> 00:35.238
Hi there, friends.

00:35.258 --> 00:37.922
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:37.942 --> 00:40.685
Glad you could come up this way again on up the trail.

00:40.765 --> 00:43.149
So how about having a seat beside me?

00:43.189 --> 00:45.512
Get on this log under the old pine trees.

00:46.538 --> 00:49.481
It's mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:49.501 --> 00:52.364
That's cause we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:53.265 --> 00:57.911
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:57.931 --> 01:02.596
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there, the sons of the pioneers.

01:03.136 --> 01:05.159
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail, too.

01:05.699 --> 01:11.786
Now that you're here and comfortably settled, they're going to start off this little outdoor get-together of ours.

01:11.806 --> 01:15.550
So just relax and let's hear some mighty fine singing, huh?

01:20.305 --> 01:26.079
Everything under the sun has a love song.

01:27.723 --> 01:33.015
And someone or something to sing that love song to.

01:35.948 --> 01:55.493
I've heard each one to some loved one call, but the sweetest of all was the song of the waterfall.

02:03.758 --> 02:11.322
I hear the virgin timber call, the love song of the waterfall.

02:26.236 --> 02:38.149
There it mingles through the trees.

02:38.169 --> 02:47.239
A love song born up on the breeze.

02:50.262 --> 02:54.066
Plunging over rugged rocks.

02:54.485 --> 02:59.216
Hear the water sigh.

02:59.236 --> 03:09.980
Come to me where you are, dear one.

03:10.441 --> 03:14.029
Here am I.

03:18.025 --> 03:24.641
For this is heaven's mating call.

03:28.190 --> 03:47.692
The love song of the waterfall.

03:47.692 --> 03:50.595
Love song of the waterfall.

03:50.615 --> 03:51.336
Pretty, wasn't it?

03:52.678 --> 04:01.969
And since we're talking about waterfalls, I bet everybody has some favorite spot in the forest or woods where the water runs clear and clean.

04:03.230 --> 04:05.173
Doesn't have to be a waterfall, especially.

04:05.894 --> 04:07.435
It can be a creek or a river.

04:08.497 --> 04:15.305
But have you ever seen that favorite waterway of yours after a fire has done its evil work back where the water comes from?

04:16.706 --> 04:17.327
If you have,

04:17.577 --> 04:20.601
then the water no longer runs clear if it runs at all.

04:21.362 --> 04:35.942
Because when fire eats away at the protective covering of the soil, it destroys the grass and brush and trees that allowed the rain and snow to soak in and be stored for slow, steady release.

04:35.962 --> 04:42.370
Yes, when fire runs wild and does its evil work, nature's water factory is thrown all out of balance.

04:43.211 --> 04:47.517
The soil, without its protective cover, no longer can absorb

04:47.783 --> 04:50.547
no longer can store the water that falls upon it.

04:51.568 --> 04:59.380
And so that water rushes off the land, carrying with it the little growth that's left along with the precious topsoil itself.

04:59.400 --> 05:06.170
It's kind of like what happens when you run a hose on a pavement and the water carries off all the dirt and the debris.

05:07.471 --> 05:16.845
Yes, sir, when the protective plant growth is lost, the whole system of streamflow is upset and you go from one extreme to another, either too much water

05:17.095 --> 05:22.905
You know, I hope fire never destroys the brush and trees that surround a favorite spot of mine.

05:23.826 --> 05:26.150
It's part of a mighty important watershed itself.

05:27.132 --> 05:28.615
I'm talking about Old Smokey.

05:29.156 --> 05:30.057
The mountains, that is.

05:31.319 --> 05:38.191
Well, sir, it seems to me there's enough trouble up on Old Smokey without a forest fire running wild around there.

05:38.211 --> 05:41.196
On top of Old Smokey.

05:42.475 --> 06:10.035
All covered with snow I lost my true lover For courtin' too slow. For courtin' is pleasure But pardon is greed And a false-hearted lover

06:10.167 --> 06:30.640
is worse than a thief. Now a thief will just rob you and take what you have, but a false hearted lover will lead you to the grave.

06:31.193 --> 06:37.884
Come all you young fellas, and you listen to me.

06:39.727 --> 06:47.699
Never place your affection on a green willow tree.

06:48.200 --> 06:53.168
For the leaves, they will wither. The roots,

06:53.452 --> 07:02.645
they will die. You'll all be forsaken, and you'll never know why.

07:02.645 --> 07:26.810 
[Music.]

07:26.810 --> 07:31.766
Now, we were talking about what happens to water when fire runs wild over the land.

07:32.988 --> 07:34.730
Well, friends, let me tell you a little story.

07:35.251 --> 07:44.624
Now, back in November of 1933, someone was careless with fire in the mountain watershed area above the town of Montrose, California.

07:44.644 --> 07:46.787
The brush cover was completely destroyed.

07:47.828 --> 07:49.210
Now, just about a month later...

07:49.510 --> 07:51.212
It was New Year's Day, in fact.

07:51.232 --> 07:56.459
A heavy rain beat down upon the mutilated soil and brought a disastrous flood to Montrose.

07:56.940 --> 07:59.062
Thirty lives were lost.

07:59.082 --> 08:02.907
Property damage amounted to five million dollars.

08:02.927 --> 08:07.694
And the folks who lived through that noticed that the flood came only from the burned watershed.

08:08.495 --> 08:13.942
There were no floods from other watersheds in the vicinity, which hadn't burned but received the same storm.

08:15.043 --> 08:16.265
That's just one example.

08:16.345 --> 08:18.808
There are others, many others, around the country.

08:19.987 --> 08:36.104
Hardly a year passes without the headlines screaming that floods have struck again, along New England's Connecticut, or the Chattahoochee in Georgia, or along the Ohio and Mississippi in the central states, or out of the gulches and arroyas in the west.

08:36.124 --> 08:42.490
Of course, you get floods usually where the land has been abused, and careless fire is one of the worst offenders.

08:42.811 --> 08:47.175
You know, Billy, we've been on mountain fires, fighting them, and like you say,

08:47.628 --> 08:53.314
bad as those forest and brush fires were, it's what followed that really made you stop and think.

08:54.215 --> 09:06.387
The smoke on some of those fires had hardly disappeared when along came a heavy rain, and whoosh, the water poured off those burned mountains just like Deuce here laying it on that bull fiddle of his in a fast hoedown.

09:07.187 --> 09:10.010
And it wasn't only water that came off the mountains.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.213
There were rocks and mud, tons of it.

09:13.934 --> 09:14.935
You can imagine what a

09:15.252 --> 09:23.789
flash flood like that can do to farmland, homes, and even folks who couldn't get out of the way fast enough.

09:23.809 --> 09:25.954
Oh, forest fires are bad medicine, all right.

09:26.675 --> 09:28.353
Let's sing a song, boys.

09:28.353 --> 09:39.907
[Music.]

09:39.907 --> 09:53.086
Have you ever roamed along by a stream that sings a song upon its weave and bend in ever weary wind and wave?

09:53.787 --> 10:06.825
Have you ever watched a beam from the moon up on a stream reflect on every ripple as it rolls and rambles on?

10:07.025 --> 10:20.145
Then come along with me and maybe you will see why this roving soul of mine goes.

10:20.785 --> 10:29.218
Wandering down through the years like a book winding on in a dream.

10:31.747 --> 11:01.382
Somehow it leads me home If I'll just follow the stream. Lifting along like a leaf On the rippling waters that gleam Wondering where it goes And so I follow the stream.

11:01.649 --> 11:07.196
Through the shady nook, the leafy vale.

11:08.497 --> 11:16.727
Beyond the waterfall, I'll find a trail that leads me on.

11:18.009 --> 11:24.737
When the twilight appears, and the moon with the pale yellow beam.

11:27.923 --> 11:43.602
Guide me along as through the night I follow the stream.

11:43.622 --> 11:46.706
I know a fellow who always kind of follows the stream.

11:46.726 --> 11:50.831
He wears a ranger's hat and dungarees, and I'm sure you know him too.

11:50.851 --> 11:55.597
He's Smokey Bear, and here he comes up the trail with a special message for us.

11:55.617 --> 11:57.559
Hello there, folks.

11:58.366 --> 12:02.730
You know, fire is a pretty good thing when it's under control.

12:03.491 --> 12:05.873
And so is water when it's under control.

12:06.613 --> 12:14.020
But when fire and water get out of control and run wild, then there's the very devil to pay.

12:14.040 --> 12:21.747
It's kind of an evil game of tag they play, with wildfire the leader and wild water following behind.

12:22.768 --> 12:27.512
That's why it's up to everyone to be careful with fire outdoors.

12:28.252 --> 12:40.923
When you keep fire from running wild in forests and woods and on the range, you help keep water under control and lessen the erosion and floods.

12:40.943 --> 12:44.146
Well, I'll be here.

12:44.887 --> 12:46.809
And there he goes on down the trail.

12:47.409 --> 12:48.350
Thank you, Smokey.

12:49.651 --> 12:53.254
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

12:54.095 --> 12:57.178
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree here.

12:57.850 --> 13:07.604
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoors get-together possible.

13:07.624 --> 13:11.910
Until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:12.411 --> 13:17.378
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:18.455 --> 13:29.229
Well, so long for now from Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and from those wonderful fellas who sing your favorite songs of the outdoors the way you like to hear them, the Sons of the Pioneers.

13:29.790 --> 13:38.100
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:38.681 --> 13:42.486
He can find a fire before he starts to flame.

13:42.847 --> 13:47.112
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

13:47.311 --> 13:55.605
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:56.186 --> 13:59.932
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:00.293 --> 14:04.319
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:04.860 --> 14:08.847
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:09.147 --> 14:12.915
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:13.696 --> 14:17.343
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:17.744 --> 14:25.339
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:25.921 --> 14:30.109
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:30.089 --> 14:43.086
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name

14:43.086--> 15:18.590
[Music.]

15:18.590 --> 15:28.000
[Silence.]
