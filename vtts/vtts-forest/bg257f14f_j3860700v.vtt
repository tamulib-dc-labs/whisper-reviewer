00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
[Silence.]

00:19.538 --> 00:25.885
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear. Hello there, folks.

00:26.225 --> 00:29.449
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:30.070 --> 00:34.695
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:35.055 --> 00:39.320
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:39.801 --> 00:43.825
Today it's Mr. Willard Waterman, the Great Gildersleeve.

00:44.227 --> 00:46.972
one of America's best known water commissioners.

00:47.593 --> 00:48.375
Hello, Smokey.

00:48.776 --> 00:50.739
Sure glad you could join me here at the reservoir.

00:51.180 --> 00:52.483
We need your help, my boy.

00:52.944 --> 00:59.176
Apparently some people still don't realize how important it is to be careful with matches and smokes outdoors.

00:59.196 --> 01:01.761
We had a little fire here yesterday because someone was careless.

01:02.482 --> 01:05.087
You know, Smokey, it could have burned up the whole watershed.

01:05.540 --> 01:15.391
We've just got to make people understand that when they damage or destroy the land's protective cover of grass, shrubs, and trees, they're really drying up the waterworks.

01:15.411 --> 01:17.934
Yeah, I mean, their supply of water.

01:17.954 --> 01:22.058
If everyone would just think a bit, they'd be more careful with fire outdoors.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.742
They'd make it a habit to be careful.

01:25.762 --> 01:28.105
Now, how can we tell that to the American people, Smokey?

01:28.456 --> 01:33.123
How can we tell them to keep their watersheds free from fire for their own good?

01:33.283 --> 01:35.326
You've just told them, Mr. Gildersleeve.

01:35.687 --> 01:36.768
I mean, Mr. Waterman.

01:37.169 --> 01:40.654
And the sons of the pioneers here apparently agree with you.

01:40.674 --> 01:46.903
Listen to their love song of the waterfall.

01:48.284 --> 02:13.195
Everything under the sun has a love song And someone or something to sing that love song to I've heard each one to some loved one call

02:13.580 --> 02:22.032
But the sweetest of all was the song of the waterfall.

02:22.052 --> 02:39.115
I'd hear through virgin timber call

02:53.101 --> 03:02.610
And there it mingles through the trees.

03:05.873 --> 03:13.740
A love song born up on the fleas.

03:15.181 --> 03:17.183
Ooh, ooh.

03:17.943 --> 03:21.927
Plunging over rugged rocks.

03:22.362 --> 03:26.246
Hear the water sigh.

03:27.091 --> 03:28.137
Come to me.

03:33.027 --> 03:59.845
Dear one Here am I For this Is heaven's mating call The lost song

04:15.502 --> 04:18.106
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:18.126 --> 04:20.188
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:20.489 --> 04:25.916
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:25.956 --> 04:31.224
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:31.804 --> 04:45.323
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you

04:45.674 --> 04:48.418
can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:48.659 --> 04:58.033
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:58.053 --> 05:01.939
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

05:01.979 --> 05:06.906
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

05:06.906 --> 05:25.258
[Music.]

05:25.258 --> 6:56.000
[Silence.]
