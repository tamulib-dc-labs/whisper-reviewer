00:21.614 --> 00:40.599
That's all right.

00:40.619 --> 00:41.380
Sold out, Doc.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.622
Another soul made happy.

00:42.642 --> 00:43.843
Bring on another setting of eggs.

00:43.863 --> 00:45.145
We'll skim a mud hole and churn.

00:45.225 --> 00:47.328
Open a cag of nails and all go driving.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.310
Howdy, friends.

00:49.431 --> 00:49.731
How y'all?

00:50.302 --> 00:54.789
Yes, it's your old wood rider again, Jelly Elliot and the Knothead, sitting here under the old pine tree.

00:55.610 --> 00:57.794
And we're mighty glad to come your way.

00:57.994 --> 01:01.780
We hope that you'll pull up a chair and relax there for a few minutes.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.983
We're going to play some tunes here for you.

01:04.644 --> 01:10.153
And we've got a few things we want to talk over with you about the woods and such matters.

01:10.173 --> 01:16.242
We'll start things off here with Bob, Bob Henderson, the fiddle player, doing a little thing called Liberty.

01:54.815 --> 02:18.510
¶¶

02:23.063 --> 02:24.685
Thank you, Bob.

02:24.745 --> 02:25.526
Thank you there, buddy.

02:25.827 --> 02:28.770
That's what I call fine fiddling now.

02:28.790 --> 02:41.667
Friends, one of the most interesting developments in the fight against woods fires and forest fires in the last couple of years is the way the law is coming into the picture.

02:41.687 --> 02:51.940
There's more enforcement of the law against setting the woods on fire and carelessly letting them get on fire and, well, getting on fire, period.

02:52.477 --> 02:54.419
in any way that they get on fire.

02:54.980 --> 02:56.501
The law is against fire.

02:58.123 --> 02:59.284
I'll guarantee you.

02:59.304 --> 03:14.140
The sheriffs and the game wardens and all law enforcement people, they're taking more interest in it in a lot of places and they're taking this responsibility pretty seriously.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.142
But still there's some weak places.

03:16.582 --> 03:18.885
There's still some places where it's a little weak.

03:20.006 --> 03:21.808
And maybe that's where

03:22.109 --> 03:24.352
You and me can come in the picture.

03:24.372 --> 03:29.079
That's where we can come in by helping to enforce this law.

03:29.099 --> 03:32.665
Now, friends, would you let a fellow knock an old lady down?

03:32.685 --> 03:38.513
Just stand up and let a fellow knock a poor old lady down right there in front of your eyes.

03:38.574 --> 03:43.281
Or would you let a man steal a tire off of somebody's car if you knew he was stealing the tire?

03:44.042 --> 03:50.031
Would you let a man break into somebody's house and steal a sack of flour or setting eggs or anything?

03:50.692 --> 03:51.593
No, you wouldn't do it.

03:52.062 --> 03:54.564
Neither would I. Nobody would.

03:54.584 --> 03:55.545
I'll guarantee you.

03:55.565 --> 03:58.748
There's not a citizen in the United States that would stand for any such thing.

03:59.429 --> 04:05.114
If you couldn't handle a fellow yourself, you'd call the sheriff or some other police officer.

04:05.695 --> 04:10.759
You'd get in touch with somebody and, well, you'd do something about it.

04:11.280 --> 04:17.926
Well, now, you can come through in the same way when you see or know someone that's setting the woods on fire.

04:19.027 --> 04:20.128
It's the same thing.

04:20.851 --> 04:22.032
And that's just as bad.

04:22.533 --> 04:26.697
In fact, it's a lot worse in some cases.

04:26.717 --> 04:27.518
It really is.

04:27.538 --> 04:31.683
It causes a lot more damage than going into a man's house and stealing a sack of flour.

04:32.524 --> 04:41.253
Because he could go to town and buy him another sack of flour, but he can't go to town and buy him another patch of woods and a bunch of timber and trees and all that sort of thing.

04:41.834 --> 04:50.824
And friends, when you help with this sort of thing, as to reporting these people that you see letting fire get out in the woods, you're not squealing.

04:51.074 --> 04:51.475
Uh-uh.

04:51.915 --> 04:54.179
No, you're just being a good citizen.

04:54.199 --> 04:57.765
You're just being a real, true-blooded American.

04:57.785 --> 04:58.487
That's what it is.

04:58.887 --> 05:00.430
And that's the way I look at it.

05:01.372 --> 05:02.614
Don't you think the same thing?

05:02.814 --> 05:03.455
I believe you do.

05:04.036 --> 05:05.979
Had you ever stopped to think of it in that way?

05:06.861 --> 05:09.285
Well, it's the same thing.

05:10.193 --> 05:11.294
And you can all help.

05:11.694 --> 05:12.175
I can help.

05:12.275 --> 05:12.815
You can help.

05:13.376 --> 05:15.638
And we'll all get this thing done.

05:16.179 --> 05:17.380
Let's do a tune here, Charlie.

05:17.840 --> 05:23.305
How about you gathering yourself up, son, and coming up here and do this tune here called Lost Highway.

05:30.652 --> 05:38.800
I'm a rolling stone All alone and low For a life of sin

05:40.585 --> 06:09.546
I have paid the calls And as I pass by All the people say Just another guy On the lost highway Just a deck of cards And a jug of wine And a woman's lies Make a life like mine

06:12.023 --> 06:23.130
We met, I went astray Started rolling down that lost highway

06:51.241 --> 07:16.354
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you But now I'm lost, too late to pray Lord, I paid the cost on the lost highway

07:17.903 --> 07:23.189
Now boys, don't start that rambling around.

07:23.309 --> 07:30.918
On the road of sin, are you sorrow bound?

07:30.938 --> 07:37.426
Take my advice, or you'll curse the day.

07:37.446 --> 07:43.433
You started rolling down that lost highway.

07:45.275 --> 07:46.376
Thank you, Charlie, thank you.

07:46.396 --> 07:47.758
That's somebody pretty tuned there.

07:48.177 --> 07:56.427
Friends, you know, I know of a case happening here, and I really know of this case myself personally, and I wanted to tell you about it.

07:57.309 --> 08:00.132
I know of a fellow, I really know of this happening.

08:00.172 --> 08:09.184
A man went squirrel hunting, and he killed one squirrel over the limit, and the game warden caught him, and he went to jail.

08:09.204 --> 08:17.374
The reason he went to jail, friends, was that citizens in this particular section of the country went to the judge and

08:17.759 --> 08:30.117
told the judge that this man had to have some days, that this old thing of killing more squirrels than the limit had to be stopped, and he went to jail because he couldn't pay his fine.

08:30.137 --> 08:34.864
Well, they wanted the law enforced there as to killing over the limit.

08:35.244 --> 08:42.475
But now I know of another case right in the same section of the country where a man let fire get out and swept through the woods.

08:42.495 --> 08:45.960
The wind was blowing awful high, couldn't do much with the fire.

08:46.885 --> 08:51.551
But it burned over lots of acres, killed lots of young and old trees.

08:52.433 --> 08:56.578
And on top of that, it destroyed squirrel nests by the dozens.

08:56.599 --> 08:58.721
It killed young squirrels in these nests.

08:59.402 --> 09:04.229
More squirrels than you or I, either one, could hunt the rest of our life if they were protected and taken care of.

09:05.731 --> 09:07.794
Because, you see, they'd multiply every year.

09:07.854 --> 09:08.655
They'd multiply.

09:09.236 --> 09:14.243
And there'd be more squirrels there than you and me and your kids and my kids and all of us could hunt.

09:15.202 --> 09:16.844
But now was this fellow sent to jail?

09:17.645 --> 09:18.285
No.

09:18.305 --> 09:19.506
No, he wasn't sent to jail.

09:20.467 --> 09:22.129
A lot of folks knew that he did it too.

09:23.070 --> 09:29.477
But yet they didn't feel the same about the fire laws in that section.

09:29.497 --> 09:34.542
So there was no demand for his prosecution, you see, and he got away.

09:34.562 --> 09:39.167
But this guy got out and killed one over the limit with a shotgun, prosecuted him,

09:39.434 --> 09:43.680
And the fellow got out there and let the woods get on fire and burned up thousands of them.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.703
No telling how many, we got no way of knowing.

09:46.164 --> 09:48.006
But I do know that a lot of them was burned up.

09:48.787 --> 09:49.849
Well, he got by with it.

09:51.111 --> 09:53.594
Now, friends, we got to do something about it.

09:54.375 --> 09:55.256
Everybody's got to help.

09:55.276 --> 09:56.438
We got to all pull together.

09:57.279 --> 10:01.105
You know, if I start to pull on a rope and try to break the rope, maybe I can't break it.

10:01.125 --> 10:05.191
But if a bunch of you will get on that rope and help me pull it, I'll guarantee we'll pull it in two.

10:05.731 --> 10:06.252
Sure can.

10:06.620 --> 10:09.303
And that's what we've got to do about these woods fires.

10:10.084 --> 10:18.975
The fellow that lets fire get out in the woods and burns over the woods is just as guilty, or more so than the man that gets out there and kills one over the limit.

10:18.995 --> 10:20.717
Don't you think so?

10:20.737 --> 10:21.498
I know you do.

10:21.518 --> 10:23.561
I know you think so.

10:23.581 --> 10:27.786
And you just remember, friends, that the law officials, they can't do it all.

10:27.806 --> 10:28.627
They just can't do it.

10:28.647 --> 10:29.968
You take a game warden.

10:29.988 --> 10:31.550
He can't get out there and do it all.

10:32.011 --> 10:33.893
He can't look after all the game that he's

10:34.295 --> 10:35.698
has to look after them all.

10:35.718 --> 10:42.090
He has to have the cooperation of the citizens, the people of that community and location.

10:42.110 --> 10:43.673
And the same way with these woods fires.

10:44.134 --> 10:46.459
You take these boys that gets out and fights these fires.

10:46.499 --> 10:47.902
They can't do it by themselves.

10:48.322 --> 10:49.505
It's impossible.

10:49.525 --> 10:52.270
But with your help, they can.

10:52.570 --> 10:54.173
That's where you and me come in.

10:54.193 --> 10:54.855
We can help them.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.698
And I know you will and I will.

10:57.159 --> 10:58.361
And we'll get the job done.

10:58.923 --> 10:59.744
Here's the next tune.

10:59.764 --> 11:01.868
We're going to dedicate it to all the truck drivers.

11:01.908 --> 11:12.790
Herman with his steel guitar and the truck drivers ride.

12:06.584 --> 12:16.638
Well, all right.

12:16.718 --> 12:17.539
Thank you there, Herman.

12:17.579 --> 12:17.920
Thank you.

12:17.940 --> 12:32.660
You know, the reason I wanted to dedicate that tune to all the truck drivers is I've known of some cases where truck drivers have stopped side the road and put out little fires that had been started from cigarettes and matches and really saved a lot of young timber.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.621
And that's mighty nice.

12:33.955 --> 12:36.960
I want to thank you boys and just dedicate that tune to you.

12:37.621 --> 12:39.064
Well, we've run out of time, friends.

12:39.084 --> 12:42.430
We've got to go here, but the local announcer will let you know when we'll be back.

12:42.450 --> 12:45.816
And before we go, here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you.

12:46.417 --> 12:50.223
There's laws to keep our forests green, which most of us obey.

12:50.965 --> 12:55.693
For those who don't, well, we sure can help bring justice into play.

13:03.470 --> 13:11.959
Well, friends, that winds up our little visit with you today.

13:12.239 --> 13:15.383
But we'll be back, as I told you, the local announcer will let you know when.

13:15.843 --> 13:27.075
Don't forget, neighbors, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:28.337 --> 13:32.321
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

13:32.341 --> 13:32.481
Forest!

13:36.747 --> 13:37.068
.

13:37.088 --> 13:46.200
.

14:13.113 --> 14:20.541
Bye.
