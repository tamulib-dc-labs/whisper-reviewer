00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
[Silence.]

00:14.847 --> 00:22.000
[Music.]

00:22.000 --> 00:26.179
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:26.539 --> 00:28.121
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:28.181 --> 00:29.822
That was how he got his name.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.204
Hi there, friends.

00:31.304 --> 00:33.246
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:33.887 --> 00:36.049
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:36.069 --> 00:40.133
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:41.354 --> 00:43.116
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:43.940 --> 00:46.803
That's because we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:47.705 --> 00:52.410
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:53.411 --> 00:59.218
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the sons of the pioneers.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.343
Lloyd Pearman, what do you boys have for your first song?

01:03.363 --> 01:04.364
He's riding home.

01:04.445 --> 01:07.648
It's a plaintive but actually a happy song.

01:07.668 --> 01:12.394
It's about a cowboy who's finished his hard day's work and he's headed back to the home corral.

01:13.015 --> 01:22.597
Now, this cowboy has a feeling of security because as he rides along, he knows that he's left no burned forest or blackened range behind him.

01:22.618 --> 01:28.271
As he jogs along to the rhythm of his pony's hooves, he might whistle or hum or sing a song.

01:28.351 --> 01:29.674
It might come out like this.

01:44.015 --> 02:12.992
Work's all done. Evening's here at last. Moon comes up Behind the hills I love, and I'm riding home. He's riding home. See that lonesome cowboy riding down that lonesome trail

02:14.609 --> 02:41.882
Shadows sway into the tune of his lonesome. Somewhere, well, he's ridin' home. He's ridin' home. Sit down, doggies, rest a while. I'll be back tomorrow morning

02:42.470 --> 02:47.055
and take you down to where the water's cool.

02:47.695 --> 02:50.218
But now I'm riding home.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.901
He's riding home.

02:55.283 --> 03:03.851
See that lonesome cowboy riding down that lonesome trail.

03:05.433 --> 03:10.738
Bright shadows swaying to the tune of his lonesome way.

03:19.308 --> 03:39.014
I'm riding home. Friends, for some time now, we've been getting together on this outdoor trail.

03:40.015 --> 03:44.281
And we've talked about this and that, but mostly, of course, about the forests.

03:44.701 --> 03:47.745
And about that terrible enemy of the forests, fires.

03:49.227 --> 03:53.732
200,000 fires take their toll of our forests every year.

03:54.954 --> 04:01.201
We could build 86,000 five-room homes with the saw timber that's destroyed in these fires.

04:01.221 --> 04:10.131
And the pulp-sized trees that go up in smoke each year could produce enough newsprint to supply every newspaper in the United States for 12 months.

04:11.533 --> 04:12.574
There's no doubt about it.

04:12.934 --> 04:16.298
The timber destroyed in forest fires is a major loss.

04:17.611 --> 04:21.115
Golly, wouldn't it be fine if we could cut down this loss?

04:21.135 --> 04:24.480
If we could keep the forests free from fire?

04:24.500 --> 04:33.150
What a happy day that would be.

04:33.170 --> 04:44.985
Way up yonder above the sky, a bluebird lived in the jaybird's eye. But God, Jim, you can't go Go weave and spin, you can't go

04:45.522 --> 04:55.400
Buckeye Jim, way up yonder above the moon, a blue jade nest in a silver spoon.

04:56.381 --> 05:01.130
Buckeye Jim, you can't go, go weave and spin, you can't go.

05:01.811 --> 05:06.940
Buckeye Jim, way down yonder in a wooden trough.

05:07.493 --> 05:10.997
An old man died of a hooping cough.

05:11.117 --> 05:15.082
Buckeye Jim, you can't go, go weave and spin.

05:15.142 --> 05:17.684
You can't go, Buckeye Jim.

05:20.027 --> 05:26.494
Way down yonder on a hollow log, a red bird danced with a green bullfrog.

05:26.514 --> 05:30.479
Buckeye Jim, you can't go, go weave and spin.

05:30.559 --> 05:33.282
You can't go, Buckeye Jim.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.813
Kind of a silly song, isn't it?

05:38.833 --> 05:43.360
Who ever heard of a red bird dancing with a green bullfrog?

05:43.380 --> 05:47.306
And yet that isn't any sillier than some of the things that happen in real life.

05:48.588 --> 05:50.591
Did you ever hear of fire burning water?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.356
That actually happens in a way.

05:54.317 --> 05:59.185
Every time fire runs wild in the woods, in the forests, and across the rains.

06:00.312 --> 06:10.026
You see, when the protective covering on the land, the fallen leaves, the vegetation, and decaying matter is destroyed, you no longer get water seeping gradually into the soil.

06:10.707 --> 06:16.555
To add to the water table and to flow out later is a clear spring or stream.

06:16.575 --> 06:17.316
No, sir.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.741
When the protective cover is burned, the water runs off fast.

06:21.122 --> 06:25.408
You get erosion and floods, disaster, and even death.

06:26.806 --> 06:30.661
Now I see the sons of the pioneers over here have their guitars and fiddles.

06:30.801 --> 06:34.033
The little fiddles and the bold fiddles ready for action.

06:34.054 --> 06:36.563
They're going to do an instrumental called Cornflower.

06:36.563 --> 08:17.822
[Music.]

08:17.822 --> 08:19.450
Thank you, fellers.

08:20.425 --> 08:25.750
We were talking about what forest fires cost us, you and me.

08:25.770 --> 08:28.212
How about the cost of forest fires in dollars?

08:29.333 --> 08:33.798
You know it costs money to fight fires, a lot of money.

08:33.818 --> 08:42.766
Last year, our nation spent $70 million putting out forest fires, nine out of ten of which could have been prevented.

08:42.786 --> 08:46.169
Oh, forest fires are bad business, all right.

08:46.189 --> 08:46.770
Aren't they, Lloyd?

08:47.189 --> 08:50.533
The fellas and I, we've seen what fire does to a forest.

08:50.933 --> 08:52.515
It's not a pretty sight.

08:52.535 --> 08:55.058
There's no singing because the birds are gone.

08:55.078 --> 08:59.142
They can't live without a good place to nest or where there's no food.

09:00.204 --> 09:08.173
And the wind, it has a different sound whistling through bare brittle branches than it has when the leaves or needles are on the trees.

09:09.114 --> 09:15.781
And where the water once ran clear and steady alongside the forest trail, well, it may not run at all.

09:15.801 --> 09:16.622
For if it does,

09:17.024 --> 09:20.027
It's a brown, muddy flood after a rain.

09:21.068 --> 09:29.477
In a burned forest, you get a kind of silence that scares a man, gives him an empty feeling deep down in his stomach.

09:29.497 --> 09:38.287
We've seen it and felt it, the fellows in the cell.

09:38.307 --> 09:43.352
Silent trails

09:43.535 --> 09:49.801
Are you lonely where you are?

09:49.821 --> 10:00.812
Do you ever get to yearning for the pioneers returning?

10:02.214 --> 10:10.622
Are the campfires still a-burnin' silent grave?

10:13.268 --> 10:24.720
Silent trails, do the cowboys sing again?

10:26.402 --> 10:37.234
Seems I hear the echoes ringing on the breezes softly wingin'.

10:38.378 --> 11:02.307
Some far distant voice a-singin' silent trail.

11:02.327 --> 11:02.708
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:02.728 --> 11:03.108
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:03.128 --> 11:04.470
Shadow swayin'.

11:07.285 --> 11:08.848
We're here to stay.

11:14.959 --> 11:19.106
Silent trails.

11:20.128 --> 11:24.415
Do the cowboys ride again?

11:26.479 --> 11:30.947
Are the scouts ahead a guide?

11:32.125 --> 11:37.213
Are the Redskins somewhere hiding?

11:38.395 --> 11:56.462
Are their spirits still a-riding silent train?

12:00.982 --> 12:10.173
Well, would you look who's coming up the trail now?

12:10.193 --> 12:14.558
Big as life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all talked out in dungarees.

12:15.239 --> 12:17.441
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

12:17.642 --> 12:21.907
He's the popular candidate, the people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:22.648 --> 12:25.010
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:25.771 --> 12:27.373
Hello there, friends.

12:27.854 --> 12:30.617
I guess you all know what I stand for.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.462
Forests free from wildfire.

12:33.482 --> 12:40.314
But I'm not campaigning just to make things better for me and my four-legged wildlife friends.

12:40.334 --> 12:41.576
No, sir.

12:41.596 --> 12:54.158
When you support me, you help yourself and your children by guaranteeing green, productive forests, steady, clean flows of water, and you save money, too.

12:54.442 --> 12:59.230
The money it takes to put out forest, woods, and range fires.

12:59.670 --> 13:02.054
I hope you'll back me up.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.178
Well, I'll be seeing you.

13:05.019 --> 13:07.082
And there he goes down the trail.

13:07.102 --> 13:08.184
Thank you, Smokey.

13:09.626 --> 13:14.174
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.838
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine trees.

13:17.729 --> 13:26.438
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to to make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:27.399 --> 13:39.132
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:39.152 --> 13:45.559
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest, woods, and range fires.

13:46.282 --> 13:50.292
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

13:50.853 --> 13:54.803
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:55.304 --> 13:59.273
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

13:59.334 --> 14:04.105
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:04.287 --> 14:08.391
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

14:08.971 --> 14:12.955
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:13.695 --> 14:17.619
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

14:17.979 --> 14:22.323
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:22.343 --> 14:41.392
[Music.]
