00:16.990 --> 00:42.627
Thank you.

00:48.158 --> 00:55.771
Once again, the Texas Forest Service brings you 15 minutes with Charlie Adams and his Western All-Star.

00:57.334 --> 00:58.476
Howdy, friends and neighbors.

00:58.496 --> 00:59.598
This is John Scoggin.

00:59.618 --> 01:08.513
Here to start off the program with a bang is Charlie Adams and all the boys with one of his newest recordings, I'm a Railroad Daddy.

01:10.552 --> 01:15.141
Well, I'm a railroad daddy on a hip for dust.

01:15.161 --> 01:18.228
I can't love a woman that I can't trust.

01:18.468 --> 01:23.278
I'm a railroad daddy and I'm leaving today.

01:25.013 --> 01:29.439
I hear the trains are coming, it's only going one way.

01:30.540 --> 01:37.248
Gonna leave you, baby, don't mean maybe.

01:37.268 --> 01:42.615
Gonna leave you, and I'm leaving today.

01:44.418 --> 01:47.602
Well, you look like an angel, but you love like a devil.

01:47.882 --> 01:52.708
Your loving me was not on the level I'm a real old daddy.

01:52.958 --> 01:57.444
Oh, hear the whistle blow.

01:57.464 --> 02:02.852
You didn't want my loving, you just wanted my dough.

02:02.872 --> 02:09.200
Gonna leave you, baby, don't mean maybe.

02:09.601 --> 02:14.848
Gonna leave you, and I'm leaving today.

02:15.925 --> 02:35.204
Well, I bought you clothes and a diamond, too, to make you a woman, but you couldn't be true.

02:35.465 --> 02:40.870
I'm a real old daddy and I'm leaving today.

02:41.879 --> 02:46.512
You didn't want any loving, you just wanted my pay.

02:47.555 --> 02:53.552
Gonna leave you, baby, don't mean me.

02:54.355 --> 02:55.197
Gonna leave.

03:13.385 --> 03:38.700
Goodbye, sweet mama, gonna turn you loose So just wave goodbye to my caboose I'm a real old daddy, and I'm leaving today You didn't want my kisses, you just wanted my pay Gonna leave you, baby, don't mean me

03:41.853 --> 03:48.520
And I'm leaving today.

03:48.540 --> 03:49.080
Yes, sir.

03:49.180 --> 03:49.901
Thank you, Charlie.

03:50.662 --> 03:56.227
Today, now, for the benefit of some of our listeners, I want to talk about control of undesirable hardwoods.

03:56.848 --> 04:03.895
As you may or may not know, those poor quality hardwood trees growing in your pine woods are costing you a lot of money.

04:04.655 --> 04:09.320
Now, it may sound a little odd to you that today we're telling you to get rid of trees.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.522
Well, usually we tell you to plant more of them.

04:12.278 --> 04:19.429
Just as it's important for you to keep fire out of the woods, it's also important for you to keep those wolf trees out of your pines.

04:20.090 --> 04:25.018
And if you are to make the most profit from them, I've got some good advice for you.

04:25.259 --> 04:30.407
I'll tell you more about that, though, in just a couple of minutes, just as soon as Charlie plays us another song.

04:30.727 --> 04:31.388
Thank you, John.

04:31.408 --> 04:34.613
We really have a good polka number coming up now.

04:34.653 --> 04:38.860
Red, if you'll get on that according to yours, let's hit off with this Patty Ruski polka.

04:39.582 --> 05:04.662
Thank you.

05:19.930 --> 05:49.549
Thank you.

05:59.637 --> 06:05.828
Thank you, Charlie.

06:05.848 --> 06:11.037
And like I said before, folks, those undesirable trees are cutting into your profits.

06:11.057 --> 06:18.310
There are thousands of acres in the East Texas piney woods being taken over by scrubby hardwoods after the mature pines are cut.

06:19.231 --> 06:21.375
For the first couple of years, that's all right.

06:21.743 --> 06:26.508
for the hardwoods help shield the small pine seedlings from the hot rays of the sun.

06:26.528 --> 06:28.751
After that, they need the sunlight themselves.

06:29.452 --> 06:32.375
So get rid of those undesirable hardwoods.

06:32.395 --> 06:35.679
Now we don't mean that you should go out and kill all the hardwoods on your place.

06:36.360 --> 06:42.707
In the first place, unless there is a stand of pine trees underneath the hardwoods, you probably would just be wasting your money.

06:42.727 --> 06:46.451
So deaden only where pines will be released.

06:46.471 --> 06:50.856
Then be sure that all of your valuable hardwood trees are removed before you start.

06:51.275 --> 06:54.889
which leaves only the worthless, undesirable hardwoods for you to deaden.

06:55.578 --> 06:58.320
Now, those trees are the ones that we're talking about right now.

06:58.340 --> 07:05.807
And if you're one of those farmers whose pine crops are suffering because of these undesirable hardwoods, the solution is simple.

07:05.827 --> 07:07.428
It's easy and cheap.

07:07.448 --> 07:08.770
Now, here's all you have to do.

07:08.850 --> 07:10.191
Now, wait just a minute, John.

07:10.211 --> 07:15.355
Now, you've been talking a long time, and don't you think it's about time that we boys do a little number?

07:15.816 --> 07:21.120
So while you straighten out your notes, and how about us playing another tune here?

07:21.200 --> 07:21.761
Fine.

07:21.981 --> 07:25.264
Charlie, now, you know I don't need any notes to remember how to use that.

07:25.244 --> 07:31.193
M8245T that I'm going to tell the folks about, or How to Girdle to Dead and Trees.

07:31.213 --> 07:34.698
But you go right ahead and play if you've got something good.

07:34.738 --> 07:35.459
Well, thank you, John.

07:35.499 --> 07:39.285
Here we go with Kiwi on the vocal doing at the end of the line.

07:50.942 --> 07:50.982
¶¶

07:51.856 --> 08:16.665
The love that has been until now dear But they tell me that true love is blind But right now to me it's as plain as can be You've come to the end of the line You thought I'd be left brokenhearted You thought you would leave me way behind But right now to me

09:06.832 --> 09:10.401
You thought I'd be left brokenhearted.

09:10.762 --> 09:14.432
You thought you would break this heart of mine.

09:14.452 --> 09:18.001
But I've had enough, so now pack up your stuff.

09:18.242 --> 09:20.267
You've come to the end of the...

09:24.719 --> 09:32.613
Friends, I guess about the best way for you to get rid of those small, undesirable trees of yours is to use the chemical known as 245T.

09:33.295 --> 09:46.018
Now, the district foresters of the Texas Forest Service have set up several demonstration areas in order to help you solve your undesirable hardwood problems and to test the effectiveness of different methods of control.

09:45.998 --> 09:48.923
And here's what they say is all you have to do.

09:48.943 --> 09:58.617
Mix up a solution of one gallon of 245T to 20 gallons of diesel oil and simply spray it all around the base of the tree and up the trunk for about two feet.

09:59.178 --> 10:01.582
And be sure the bark is saturated.

10:01.602 --> 10:05.849
This is recommended only for trees eight inches or less to prevent sprouting.

10:06.530 --> 10:10.656
Now on trees above this size, girdling alone will generally suffice.

10:11.260 --> 10:18.814
A single hack girdle around the trunk of the tree, in which a solution of 245T is used, is also very effective.

10:19.415 --> 10:21.119
And that's all there is to it.

10:21.139 --> 10:25.246
The kill is very quick, and in a few days' time most trees will start to wilt.

10:26.208 --> 10:33.522
A few species, like hickory, die more slowly, but usually one application is all that's required to kill any tree.

10:34.109 --> 10:42.121
It doesn't affect the spray in any way, but it will make your work easier if you add a little red stain to the solution when you mix it up.

10:42.141 --> 10:49.772
You see, after a few days' time, the oil is pretty well soaked into the bark, and it's hard to see which tree has been sprayed or not.

10:49.832 --> 10:54.178
245T can be purchased from garden stores or chemical houses.

10:54.198 --> 11:01.669
Your district forester will be able to advise you on the use of it or on other methods of controlling your undesirable hardwoods.

11:01.852 --> 11:04.057
Charlie, have you got time for one more song?

11:04.197 --> 11:05.099
Yes, John, I have.

11:05.520 --> 11:15.844
I think we have time, but it's going to have to be a fast one, though, so if George gets here on his fiddle here and gets going with a little old breakdown called the Beaumont Rag.

13:12.734 --> 13:15.049
Oh, yeah.

14:17.686 --> 14:22.175
Folks, we'll wind up this program now, but here's one more thing for you to think about.

14:22.676 --> 14:30.231
ASC payments are available in many East Texas counties for woodland and pasture improvement work of this type.

14:30.251 --> 14:33.417
That is, providing applications are approved in advance.

14:50.795 --> 14:59.408
So long friends and neighbors, Charlie Adams and his Western All-Stars will be back with you again real soon with more music and help with your forestry problem.

14:59.969 --> 15:06.258
Charlie Adams and his Western All-Stars have been presented by the Texas Forest Service, a part of the Texas A&M College System.

15:06.799 --> 15:12.788
The program was written and produced by Chester O'Donnell and has been brought to you as a public service feature.

15:12.808 --> 15:14.811
Your announcer has been John Scoggins.
