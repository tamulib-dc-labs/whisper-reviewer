00:07.810 --> 00:15.441
Thank you, sir.

00:34.912 --> 00:36.814
Yes, sir.

00:36.834 --> 00:38.016
Well, thank you, boys.

00:38.036 --> 00:38.476
Thank you.

00:38.757 --> 00:39.478
Howdy, friends.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.339
How are y'all?

00:40.359 --> 00:40.799
Yes, sir.

00:40.839 --> 00:41.480
You're right.

00:41.500 --> 00:41.901
Yes, sir.

00:41.921 --> 00:43.022
Here it is once again.

00:43.102 --> 00:46.146
Time for Jelly Elliot and the three knot heads.

00:46.186 --> 00:47.107
Friends, Jelly Elliot.

00:47.127 --> 00:47.708
That's me.

00:47.728 --> 00:48.629
The old wood's right.

00:49.210 --> 00:51.212
Sitting here under the old pine tree, friends.

00:51.233 --> 00:52.975
Just shucking this corn here.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.797
Yeah, fixing to go to the mill.

00:55.598 --> 00:58.982
We want you to pull up a chair there, friends, and set a spell with it.

00:59.002 --> 00:59.603
We're going to...

00:59.971 --> 01:12.213
dish out some of these old hillbilly tunes here, and first one thing or another, and we've got a few things we want to talk over with you about the woods and the forest and such and stuff.

01:12.233 --> 01:22.671
Friends, don't forget that the boys and myself come to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service.

01:22.651 --> 01:24.278
Here we go with the first tune.

01:24.639 --> 01:32.492
Features Herman, Herman with his double bell, a steel guitar here with the little thing he calls there Roadside Ride.

02:22.355 --> 02:25.041
Thank you.

02:39.837 --> 02:43.802
Right there.

02:44.063 --> 02:44.824
Thank you, Herman.

02:44.864 --> 02:45.565
Thank you.

02:45.585 --> 02:47.687
You know, that's an old tune, old steel tune.

02:47.727 --> 02:49.790
I guess it'll always stay poplar.

02:50.111 --> 02:51.693
Mighty good fiddling there, Herman.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.715
Thank you a lot, buddy.

02:53.735 --> 02:54.817
Well, let's see here.

02:55.137 --> 02:58.502
You know, friends, I wanted to tell you about a friend I got.

02:58.522 --> 02:59.363
A friend.

03:00.644 --> 03:02.847
He's my friend here, actually.

03:02.867 --> 03:03.929
Farm Forrester.

03:04.209 --> 03:05.591
You know the Forrester boy there?

03:06.492 --> 03:07.954
You probably got one there in your farm.

03:08.457 --> 03:09.999
in your neighborhood somewhere.

03:10.019 --> 03:10.559
He's there.

03:10.599 --> 03:11.460
He's around somewhere.

03:11.540 --> 03:12.361
He's a good fella.

03:12.982 --> 03:15.004
He's a friend to everybody.

03:15.064 --> 03:17.067
Not only my friend, but everybody.

03:17.087 --> 03:19.229
He's a hard-working fella, and he's sincere.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.231
He's willing to help.

03:21.292 --> 03:24.615
Whenever your name comes up on the list, well, he's willing to help.

03:25.216 --> 03:27.919
He can tell you what you've got in the timber line.

03:27.959 --> 03:35.848
If you've got some woods out there, timber and all, he's the guy who can tell you what you've got, show you how to market for the cutting to get the highest prices,

03:36.267 --> 03:37.669
all that sort of stuff out of it.

03:38.010 --> 03:44.459
Take care of the trees and everything so you'll have another crop ready for cutting a little later on, see?

03:45.120 --> 03:48.806
And he'll help you find a market for your timber and all that.

03:48.946 --> 03:53.353
You know, I have a chance once in a while to go around with this friend of mine.

03:54.254 --> 04:00.604
I was with him one day, and we went to a place there, and they just had acres and acres of

04:01.360 --> 04:02.141
poor woods.

04:02.161 --> 04:03.463
Well, I'll just be plain.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.887
I hate to say it, but they were very poor woods.

04:06.927 --> 04:09.049
The signs of old fires everywhere.

04:09.089 --> 04:15.097
You can still see the smutty bark way up on the side of the little old scrawny pine trees there.

04:15.117 --> 04:18.401
They were still struggling, though, trying to go.

04:18.421 --> 04:26.330
And most of the woods that we went through this particular trip was just run down, and, well, they wasn't looked after or attended to or anything.

04:26.490 --> 04:29.494
Fire would go through them every year, and they'd

04:29.828 --> 04:34.153
Well, it just got to where they're in the neighborhood, and everybody just called them just a piece of wood.

04:34.213 --> 04:34.653
That's all.

04:34.673 --> 04:35.774
That's all it was.

04:36.215 --> 04:42.621
Well, sure, that's all it was because it got that away because it's burned every year.

04:42.641 --> 04:46.005
Now, this forestry fellow, this friend of mine, he sized it up this way.

04:46.966 --> 04:53.012
He said in too many places, some of the folks still don't care whether the wood's burned or not.

04:53.953 --> 04:54.654
Ain't that amazing?

04:55.335 --> 04:58.418
And still, in some places, people don't care whether the wood's burned or not.

04:59.242 --> 05:02.350
We see it, and I'm satisfied you see it.

05:02.370 --> 05:13.678
Yet these same people that don't care whether the woods burn every year or not, they wonder why they don't get the same prices for their poor, burnt, fire-scarred timber as the other folks for their nice, clean timber.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.204
Now let Forrester fella put it this way.

05:17.129 --> 05:24.222
He says, just as long as some folks look on their woods and forest lands as this land that ain't worth much, there's gonna be fire.

05:24.723 --> 05:25.344
Ain't that bad?

05:25.765 --> 05:26.506
Here's a tune here.

05:26.526 --> 05:27.408
Let's play a tune, boys.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.690
I'll get started and can't stop.

05:28.950 --> 05:30.613
Here's Jack to sing this next tune.

05:30.653 --> 05:31.936
Jack does a good job on it.

05:32.256 --> 05:33.058
Have at it, son.

05:33.138 --> 05:37.045
Why should we try any more?

05:43.994 --> 05:56.374
What's the use to deny we've been living a lie that we should have admitted before?

05:56.454 --> 06:10.997
We were just victims of a half-hearted love, so why should we try anymore?

06:11.669 --> 06:17.656
The vows that we make are only to pray.

06:18.577 --> 06:25.305
We drift like the wave from the shore.

06:25.325 --> 06:31.252
The kisses we steal, we know we're not real.

06:32.093 --> 06:39.202
So why should we try anymore?

06:39.222 --> 06:39.482
Yes, darling.

06:44.272 --> 07:08.760
I stole the rest.

07:14.022 --> 07:33.887
On the path, let's close the door And smile, don't regret, but live and forget There's no use to try anymore

07:34.576 --> 07:48.011
What's the use to deny we've been living the lie that we should have admitted before?

07:48.792 --> 07:56.161
We were just victims of a half-hearted love.

07:56.181 --> 08:04.110
There's no use to try anymore.

08:04.732 --> 08:05.934
Thank you there, Jackson.

08:05.974 --> 08:06.735
Thank you, friends.

08:06.755 --> 08:07.936
That was Jack Youngblood.

08:08.597 --> 08:09.778
Jack Hank Youngblood.

08:10.659 --> 08:11.661
Singing, why?

08:12.302 --> 08:13.803
Well, that's mighty fine, Jack.

08:13.823 --> 08:15.466
We'll let you come back up here in a few minutes.

08:16.006 --> 08:18.529
I want you to get that fiddle ready to play a hoedown here in a few minutes.

08:18.590 --> 08:21.113
First, I wanted to tell another story here.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.055
I got on this storytelling, you know.

08:23.436 --> 08:27.100
I made several trips with this friend of mine, that forestry boy there.

08:27.761 --> 08:32.427
He carried me through some woods where he'd help the owners to help themselves.

08:32.828 --> 08:34.349
That's just putting it plain, you know.

08:34.369 --> 08:36.731
He'd help them to help themselves.

08:36.751 --> 08:47.641
One case, a farmer had about 60 acres of wood there, and somebody come along there, some leatherhead offered him $200 for all the poop wood on this 20 acres.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.262
Now, think of that.

08:49.843 --> 08:55.828
Well, it meant just about cleaning all the timber off this area that he'd been keeping the fire out of, and it was really pretty.

08:56.289 --> 08:59.392
For years, he'd kept the fire, and it was really pretty stuff.

08:59.412 --> 09:02.194
Well, he was about in mind to sell there one time, but, uh,

09:02.663 --> 09:14.958
My buddy there, the forester man, he had a talk with him, and he showed him how this, showed him just what good timber he had and how it was growing and coming right along, giving him a little piece of advice there.

09:14.978 --> 09:19.923
And the result was that this farmer, he sold only specially marked timber.

09:20.564 --> 09:23.247
He went out there and marked this timber with the help of this forester boy.

09:23.788 --> 09:25.931
And friends, he sold $210 worth.

09:26.792 --> 09:30.716
Well, that's $10 more than this guy offered him for all of it.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.198
Just clean it off and leave it back.

09:33.258 --> 09:36.821
And now he's still got a good stand of trees there for another sale.

09:37.322 --> 09:42.006
Now this fellow, he's helping his neighbor and trying to encourage them to do the same thing they would.

09:42.026 --> 09:45.830
Another case I know of, we went out and visited a widow woman.

09:45.850 --> 09:50.595
And this widow woman was in bad need of some cash there for some reason or other.

09:50.615 --> 09:57.962
My friend, the forestry boy, told me there one time she got in a hurry for some cash, and she figured the quickest way to get it was sell-offs on her saw law.

09:57.982 --> 09:59.383
She had some beautiful timber there.

10:00.038 --> 10:02.921
And the first thing she thought of would sell some of this timber.

10:02.941 --> 10:10.570
So she got a bid on it and some leather head offered her $600 for it, all the saw logs, on all this nice timber.

10:10.590 --> 10:17.018
Well, this forestry friend of mine, he gave her a little advice and helped her and they're always ready to do.

10:17.699 --> 10:23.886
They marked certain trees for saw logs and they had them cut and they cleaned up the tops of pulpwood.

10:24.406 --> 10:29.194
Friends, believe it or not, this poor wooded woman here wound up with $1,200 out of it.

10:29.474 --> 10:31.858
Now, that's twice as much as she'd been offered the first time.

10:32.559 --> 10:35.023
Now, she's still got a good stand of pine left on the land.

10:35.884 --> 10:40.091
She's got fire lanes plowed all around it and keeps fire out.

10:41.253 --> 10:47.443
And she's one of the lot of folks who know that to grow good timber, you've got to keep fire out.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.910
Jack, how about you coming up here, buddy?

10:49.950 --> 10:52.333
We got a lot of old-timers out there listening, I'm sure.

10:53.214 --> 10:54.575
I'll tell you what I want you to do, Jack.

10:54.695 --> 11:00.362
On this particular program, I want you to change the tune of that fiddle and play a real old-time fiddle tune.

11:00.402 --> 11:03.105
Reach way back and just change the tune of it.

11:03.125 --> 11:06.348
Go ahead and change the tune of it, and I'll stand here and tell them.

11:07.569 --> 11:08.510
No, go right ahead and tune it.

11:08.530 --> 11:09.371
That's what I want you to do.

11:09.391 --> 11:10.292
Just go ahead and tune it up.

11:10.312 --> 11:14.477
Friends, Jack is an old-time fiddle player, and he's going to cross-cord this fiddle.

11:14.693 --> 11:21.602
I know a lot of you have heard fellas playing cross chords, but you probably never heard one tune it and change it all at the same time.

11:21.622 --> 11:23.584
But that's what Jack's going through right now.

11:23.604 --> 11:24.285
He's tuned it.

11:24.305 --> 11:31.815
He's got the thing up to his ear, and he's twisting his face and spitting in his ears, and he's going to drag a stick across it here in just a few minutes.

11:31.835 --> 11:32.636
Are you ready, Jackson?

11:33.076 --> 11:33.537
Got it, Tim?

11:33.877 --> 11:34.498
Hurry up, son.

11:34.518 --> 11:36.441
I'm running short on time here.

11:37.562 --> 11:42.488
Anyhow, friends, when he gets this fiddle cross-corded, you old-timers out there know you're going to enjoy this.

11:42.588 --> 11:43.890
I can just see you out there now.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.365
Let's pull up the chair there and spit in the fire.

11:47.369 --> 11:48.794
And Jack will get that fiddle ready.

11:48.814 --> 11:49.818
You got it ready there, Jack?

11:49.838 --> 11:50.359
I'm not ready.

11:50.661 --> 11:52.206
Go ahead.

11:52.226 --> 11:53.972
Jack says he's not ready, but here we're going.

11:54.032 --> 11:55.257
It's our black mountain rag.

11:55.277 --> 11:55.618
Jack.

11:56.678 --> 11:57.840
All right.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.202
All right.

11:59.262 --> 12:19.817
All right.

12:24.877 --> 12:28.137
THE END

12:34.580 --> 12:52.856
Well, all right, Jack.

12:52.876 --> 12:56.723
I told you he'd have the bug for us flying there, friends, when he did get it tuned.

12:57.226 --> 13:03.772
That was pretty good fiddling there, Jack, and I know a lot of our old-time friends out there really enjoyed it, and we sincerely hope you did.

13:03.832 --> 13:09.097
Friends, we've run out of time here due to the clock on the wall.

13:09.137 --> 13:10.358
Said we got to go.

13:10.378 --> 13:13.641
We hate it, but we've enjoyed this visit, William.

13:13.701 --> 13:14.983
We want you to know that, friends.

13:16.024 --> 13:19.447
Here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you before we rush off here.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.689
I'd like for you to think this over.

13:22.730 --> 13:24.111
Here's something to keep in mind.

13:24.612 --> 13:26.153
Timber owners, I'm talking to you.

13:27.112 --> 13:31.717
For good grade timber and highest prices, you can't burn your trees and have them, too.

13:45.631 --> 13:48.995
Well, friends, there it is, all wrapped up, signed, sealed, and delivered.

13:49.015 --> 13:50.416
The time's come when we've got to go.

13:50.576 --> 13:53.119
We've enjoyed sitting here under those pine trees.

13:53.555 --> 13:55.878
Yes, sir, we've enjoyed this little visit with you.

13:55.898 --> 13:57.379
We hope to see you again real soon.

13:57.399 --> 14:00.843
If you'll listen to your local announcer, he'll let you know when we'll be back.

14:00.863 --> 14:14.058
Friends, don't forget, this little get-together is made possible, brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service, with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

14:14.759 --> 14:18.803
Remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fire.
