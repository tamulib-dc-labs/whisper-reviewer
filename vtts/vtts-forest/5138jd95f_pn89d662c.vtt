00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
[Silence.]

00:13.000 --> 00:22.930
[Music.]

00:22.930 --> 00:37.513
Well, thank you, men.

00:37.533 --> 00:38.735
Thank you a lot there, friends.

00:38.755 --> 00:39.797
Here it is once again.

00:40.137 --> 00:44.905
Time for Jelly Elliott and the three Knotheads are sitting here under this big old pine tree.

00:45.222 --> 00:51.791
And we're really having a lot of fun among ourselves here, and we want you to come in and have some with us.

00:51.811 --> 00:53.053
You'll do that, won't you?

00:53.073 --> 01:01.144
Just pull up a chair there and leave your dial set right where it is, and we're going to play some tunes here that maybe you'll like some of them.

01:01.164 --> 01:01.845
You can't tell.

01:02.185 --> 01:04.789
And I've got something here I wanted to tell you anyhow.

01:04.809 --> 01:08.153
I've been wanting to see you so I can tell you, and this is an opportunity.

01:08.173 --> 01:14.402
Here we go with the first tune, and Robert's going to fiddle it on his garden seed fiddle, Ida Red.

01:14.402 --> 02:15.942
[Music.]

02:15.942 --> 02:18.525
Thank you, Robert.

02:18.545 --> 02:18.926
Thank you.

02:18.946 --> 02:21.109
That was the only little boy Ms.

02:21.129 --> 02:24.153
Shivers has got named Robert playing Eye to Red.

02:24.173 --> 02:24.974
Thank you there, buddy.

02:25.034 --> 02:25.634
Thank you a lot.

02:25.995 --> 02:29.860
Friends, I wanted to tell you something that happened to me one time.

02:30.421 --> 02:33.945
I was in the forestry office and a fire call come in.

02:34.606 --> 02:39.973
I'm telling you, friends, I wish I could just give you a picture of just what actually happened.

02:40.013 --> 02:40.954
How the fire

02:41.272 --> 02:43.495
The thing was carried on there.

02:43.515 --> 02:48.080
It was dry that day and windy, and that means a lot of danger.

02:48.281 --> 02:48.881
It really does.

02:49.622 --> 02:55.129
The people was running sideways there, and I had to back off in the corner and get out of the way.

02:55.149 --> 03:02.418
The radio was cutting in and off and carrying on, and them fellas up in the towers was calling in.

03:03.359 --> 03:05.802
And you know, they got a way of locating these fires.

03:05.822 --> 03:09.827
It's really wonderful how them fellas up in the tower can spot these smokes and

03:10.094 --> 03:22.912
One will talk over to the other one and tell him just he's got a compass thing there pointing, and he'll tell him just what direction he sees the fire, and the other one will talk back to him and tell him just what direction he sees it.

03:22.932 --> 03:28.920
And wherever these things cross, wherever these two marks cross there, that's where the fire is located.

03:28.940 --> 03:33.587
It's simple after you understand it, but still it's something.

03:33.607 --> 03:34.868
It's amazing.

03:34.888 --> 03:38.814
Well, anyhow, this was all going on there, and I was there.

03:38.834 --> 03:39.595
I happened to be there.

03:39.997 --> 03:50.929
And one of these fire fellows, these forestry boys, looked over at me, backed off in the corner trying to stay out of the way, and they was getting them tractor plows and all that stuff and the rakes and things ready.

03:51.610 --> 03:54.833
I'm telling you, it was really some squally times around there.

03:55.875 --> 04:05.245
It's just like a fire in town when a house catches on fire and the fire trucks come down the street just screaming and people trying to get out of the way.

04:05.528 --> 04:07.731
Everybody running sideways and all.

04:07.791 --> 04:08.712
It's the same thing.

04:08.732 --> 04:10.293
It's the same thing.

04:10.634 --> 04:13.197
The woods is on fire, and it's got to be stopped.

04:13.217 --> 04:17.362
And these fellows, they're the fellows to stop it, you know.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.665
And this forester looked over at me and said, Come on, Jelly.

04:20.685 --> 04:22.768
He says, Here's where you get in on one, too, buddy.

04:23.208 --> 04:27.113
He said, This is one that you didn't help prevent, so you can help fight it.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.014
So there I was.

04:28.034 --> 04:31.798
It looked like I had to get in on this one, whether I wanted to or not.

04:31.858 --> 04:33.460
But I really did want to.

04:33.811 --> 04:59.194
One thing I wanted to see how all that was carried on and another thing I wanted to help stop that fire. So we all pitched in there and here we went and 
I was in the pickup truck with him and and his radio was on. They got a two-way radio in them trucks, you know. They can talk backwards and forwards to 
one another to tower into the office and all and it was a going and here me and him was a going out there to where the fire was going. He knew right exactly 
where to go and

04:59.393 --> 05:01.857
And everything by this direction finder and all that.

05:02.057 --> 05:05.743
I want to tell you all about this, friends, but I guess we better play a tune first.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.605
Slim's going to sing a sweet tune here.

05:07.886 --> 05:09.508
But I don't care what you sing, son.

05:09.528 --> 05:11.832
You ain't going to get me out of the notion of telling this story.

05:11.872 --> 05:13.234
This is something I want to tell you.

05:13.494 --> 05:28.176
Here's Slim to sing I Love You Because.

05:31.793 --> 06:00.180
I love you because you understand, dear. Every single thing I try to do, you're always there to lend a helping hand, dear, but most of all I love you cause you're you

06:02.978 --> 06:32.040
No matter what the world may say about me, I know your love will always see me through. I love you for the way you never doubt me, but most of all I love you cause you're you.

06:32.040 --> 06:51.703
[Music.]

06:51.703 --> 06:56.678
I love you because my heart is lighter

06:59.763 --> 07:29.618
every time you're walking by my side. I love you because the future's brighter. The doors to happiness you've opened wide. No matter what may be the style in season

07:30.863 --> 07:56.601
I know your heart will always be true. I love you for a hundred thousand reasons, but most of all I love you cause you're you.

07:57.644 --> 08:24.225
Well thank you Slim thank you. I love you because. You know friends i tell you that these forestry fellers they mean business when it comes to getting out 
and putting out these forest fires and no mistakes either. I tell you i they really mean business. Now i was going to tell you this story about what all 
happened here. It was really something. Trucks was going and they had the the the fire the

08:24.678 --> 08:26.881
Tractor plows and all that stuff.

08:26.921 --> 08:28.143
Well, I get all excited.

08:28.223 --> 08:30.506
I'm really living this thing all over again.

08:30.606 --> 08:36.094
I just it just gets in my blood. Now this fire was on local property.

08:36.114 --> 08:49.032
I mean it where the fire was burning belong to a man there in the community But now the wind was strong and I told you it was dry and it was and it was headed for public forest and

08:49.315 --> 08:52.519
It started in a field, how the whole thing got started.

08:52.579 --> 08:56.644
It started in a field where a farmer had been burning some new ground.

08:56.664 --> 09:02.312
You know, he took in a new ground there and he burned these brush piles the evening before.

09:02.332 --> 09:12.665
Well, all of his neighbors around there, they kind of got peeved at him because he knew it wasn't fitting weather to burn these brush piles and they didn't think he should have ever burned them in the first place.

09:12.705 --> 09:14.688
And personally, I don't think he should either.

09:15.629 --> 09:15.829
And

09:16.197 --> 09:19.320
But anyway, it was done started, and that was it.

09:20.301 --> 09:22.162
And, friends, it was just like a war.

09:22.182 --> 09:23.484
In fact, that's what it was.

09:23.524 --> 09:25.005
It was a war.

09:25.025 --> 09:28.968
It was a war against a tough enemy, too, and that's a fire.

09:28.988 --> 09:30.830
You know, fire is awful.

09:30.850 --> 09:34.413
Boy, it'll take your life in a minute without any questions asked.

09:34.433 --> 09:40.679
Whether you're an innocent baby or how old or whatnot, it'll take your life.

09:40.699 --> 09:43.461
And it's got to be handled just like an enemy.

09:43.481 --> 09:45.343
It's got to be handled just like a rattlesnake.

09:45.796 --> 09:50.172
And there we was out there, I had me a rake, and boy, I'm telling you, I was raking leaves.

09:50.252 --> 09:52.058
I had the leaves flying.

09:52.078 --> 09:55.671
And then they got the tractor plowing, got ahead there and plowed big

09:56.022 --> 10:03.609
places there across the woods to check this fire, you know, and they were setting fire ahead of this big fire.

10:03.629 --> 10:09.535
This big fire was just roaring and sweeping everything clean, I mean, and rabbits was going, birds was flying.

10:09.975 --> 10:23.768
Friends, one poor old deer was back in there, and he come out of there with, he had done God's scorch, and he jumped plumb over one of these men and scared the man as he did the deer, but that poor thing was, he was running for dear life, trying to get out of it.

10:24.052 --> 10:25.413
They set these backfires.

10:25.493 --> 10:28.757
I thought at first that was foolishness, but they knew what they was doing.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.479
See, they were setting backfire to slow down that big fire.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.642
And it was all teamwork.

10:33.662 --> 10:35.123
They all knew what they was doing.

10:35.603 --> 10:38.626
And it was really something to see.

10:38.787 --> 10:43.151
I wish it was so that every man could fight just one fire.

10:43.171 --> 10:44.192
Just one.

10:44.212 --> 10:47.095
Believe me, friends, I'd make a believer out of him.

10:47.335 --> 10:49.557
He'd be more particular with his matches from then on.

10:50.318 --> 10:52.320
Well, sir, friends, we stopped that fire.

10:52.604 --> 10:55.507
just before it got into the public forest.

10:55.527 --> 10:59.671
Now, the fellow who let his brush fire get away, he felt mighty bad over it.

11:00.412 --> 11:02.574
Because it takes money to put out a fire like that.

11:03.916 --> 11:08.260
And I hope that this story will help prevent some woods fires and forest fires in the future.

11:08.801 --> 11:09.562
That's what I hope.

11:09.782 --> 11:10.663
Here's the next tune.

11:11.023 --> 11:12.585
It's an instrumental tune.

11:12.905 --> 11:13.606
That's what it is.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.408
It features the guitar.

11:16.089 --> 11:20.333
Mr. Tyler himself is going to do just a dab, dab, and a half, two dabs of Roadside Rag.

11:20.684 --> 12:26.024
[Music.]

12:26.024 --> 12:31.172
Well, thank you, Charlie.

12:31.212 --> 12:32.614
Thank you a whole lot there, buddy.

12:32.634 --> 12:33.215
There it was.

12:34.037 --> 12:36.300
Jerk, jerk, and have two jerks of Roadside Rag.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.604
Friends, you all know Smokey Bear.

12:39.004 --> 12:40.306
I hope you all know him.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.550
That's the forest fire-preventing bear.

12:42.911 --> 12:48.319
They got his picture in the papers, store windows, and places like that all over the country.

12:48.704 --> 12:57.254
Well, me and Smokey Bear is real close buddies, friends, in this drive to stop man-caused forest and woods fire.

12:58.155 --> 13:00.838
So I got him in a little thought for the day.

13:00.858 --> 13:02.960
I want you to listen to it and think about it.

13:03.962 --> 13:06.925
Put your campfire out, says Smokey Bear.

13:07.766 --> 13:09.328
Put out your smoke, says he.

13:10.389 --> 13:16.416
I say be careful all the time for your own sake, for Smokey and for me.

13:17.003 --> 13:20.162
Hey!

13:21.307 --> 13:25.313
Friends, we've really enjoyed this little visit here with you under the old pine tree.

13:25.453 --> 13:27.436
We've enjoyed having you listen.

13:27.456 --> 13:29.379
We want to have you listen to us again.

13:29.839 --> 13:32.664
Listen to the announcer, and he'll let you know what day we'll be back.

13:33.044 --> 13:45.222
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:45.883 --> 13:50.149
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:50.149 --> 14:16.052
[Music.]

14:16.052 --> 14:31.000
[Silence.]
