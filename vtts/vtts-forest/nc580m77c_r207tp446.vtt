00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
[Silence.]

00:05.000 --> 00:34.000
[Music.]

00:34.000 --> 00:36.864
Thank you, boys.

00:36.884 --> 00:37.805
Thank you.

00:37.825 --> 00:38.205
That's it.

00:38.245 --> 00:39.046
Here it is, friends.

00:39.187 --> 00:43.352
Once again, it's time for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads, that is.

00:44.533 --> 00:47.697
Sitting here under the old pine tree, we've really been enjoying ourselves, friends.

00:47.737 --> 00:51.662
We hope that you'll come in and enjoy yourself for a little while.

00:51.682 --> 00:54.286
Yeah, you know the trouble with people is they worry too much.

00:54.967 --> 00:59.232
Pull up a chair there and relax, and we're going to get started off here with some of these old

00:59.600 --> 01:01.563
Billy tunes, maybe you'll like one of them.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.385
This first one here, I believe you'll like it.

01:03.425 --> 01:04.707
Jack's doing the fiddling on it.

01:05.347 --> 01:07.670
Jack, he's quite a fiddle player, as you already know.

01:08.071 --> 01:09.873
And he does a good job on this one here.

01:09.893 --> 01:15.901
It's that mule tune, that Flop-Eared Mule, Jack.

01:15.921 --> 02:21.983
[Music.]

02:21.983 --> 02:25.007
I declare that was mighty good fiddling there, Jackson, old boy.

02:25.628 --> 02:26.870
That's a Flop-Eared Mule.

02:27.271 --> 02:39.909
You know, friends, I was riding the other day up in the woods up on the river, and I was riding along there, and I just was looking and thinking there about the watershed of this particular river.

02:40.610 --> 02:43.053
Now, you know what a watershed is, don't you?

02:43.073 --> 02:50.404
Yeah, that's the land and the small streams, the springs and, well, all that sort of stuff that, uh,

02:50.806 --> 02:54.071
the water comes from to form this river stream.

02:54.451 --> 02:56.314
It's where it gets its water.

02:56.334 --> 03:01.863
When it rains on the hill over yonder, well, that water runs off and eventually winds up down in the river.

03:01.883 --> 03:03.165
That forms the river.

03:03.445 --> 03:09.093
Like all these little places coming in together and all, well, the more it comes in, the bigger the river.

03:09.114 --> 03:10.415
That's what the watershed is.

03:10.456 --> 03:14.221
And I was on this particular stream riding along there, and I was thinking about it.

03:15.183 --> 03:19.429
And you know, you take out in the woods like that,

03:19.679 --> 03:29.791
where you've got this watershed, the leaves, and the old dead chunks, and limbs, and grass, and roots, and all that sort of stuff, they have a tendency to hold this water.

03:30.352 --> 03:31.993
They won't let it rush off, you know.

03:32.114 --> 03:40.543
You take on the side of a hill, especially, and if you cut all the timber off the side of the hill, it's just a matter of a year or two until everything's washed off the side of the hill.

03:41.204 --> 03:44.008
It washes it off right down to the pure old clay.

03:44.048 --> 03:48.673
I mean, it makes it unfit for anything.

03:49.025 --> 03:51.988
That's the point I'm trying to get to is this watershed.

03:52.529 --> 03:58.876
We need these leaves and these chunks and sticks and roots and grass and all that sort of stuff to kind of hold this water back.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.138
Everybody dreads a flood.

04:01.759 --> 04:03.161
You know, nobody wants a flood.

04:03.921 --> 04:08.366
Floods cause some awful damages and all that sort of stuff.

04:08.446 --> 04:10.729
If you've ever gone through one, you know what I'm talking about.

04:10.769 --> 04:11.510
I've gone through them.

04:12.631 --> 04:14.453
And a flood is awful.

04:14.473 --> 04:15.454
Nobody wants a flood.

04:16.042 --> 04:21.049
Well, one way in keeping back these floods is to take care of the watershed on this particular stream.

04:21.750 --> 04:25.355
And to take care of the watershed means to take care of the timber.

04:25.375 --> 04:28.640
You can go in and let fire get in there and burn off all the watershed.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.503
And actually, the water's in a hurry to get to the river.

04:30.523 --> 04:33.747
And first thing you know, it creates a flood there.

04:33.767 --> 04:35.109
Here's the next tune.

04:35.129 --> 04:38.274
And it features our fiddle player, our champion fiddle player, Jack.

04:38.294 --> 04:39.836
He does a mighty good job on this.

04:39.916 --> 04:41.278
And Jack, just have at it, son.

04:41.318 --> 04:42.680
I thought maybe you'd like it, neighbors.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.783
The Orange Blossom Special.

04:44.783 --> 04:58.842
[Music.]

04:58.842 --> 05:03.135
July the 3rd, 1908, a train left Birmingham, Alabama, headed for Knoxville, Tennessee.

05:03.175 --> 05:04.003
She started off something like this.

05:04.003 --> 05:12.868
[Music.]

05:12.868 --> 05:14.791
Hey, Jenny, where you going?

05:14.811 --> 05:16.233
I'm going to Little Rock, son.

05:16.253 --> 05:16.854
Little Rock?

05:17.054 --> 05:17.254
Yeah.

05:17.955 --> 05:19.758
How far is it?

05:19.778 --> 05:20.659
I don't know.

05:21.753 --> 05:24.337
Be glad when we get there, though.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.641
Yeah, boy.

05:26.661 --> 05:28.871
Most of the railroad costs it's something like this.

05:28.871 --> 05:36.476
[Music.]

05:36.476 --> 05:37.617
Blow your whistle, son.

05:37.617 --> 06:09.046
[Music.]

06:09.046 --> 06:10.046
Blow your whistle, son.

06:10.046 --> 06:15.046
[Music.]

06:15.046 --> 06:18.991
This train starts on a great long tunnel that gets down something like this.

06:19.031 --> 06:26.623
Better hold your hand on your bill before it's dark under here.

06:26.643 --> 06:28.125
Take me out of here, Jack.

06:28.265 --> 06:29.307
Let's get out of here.

06:31.312 --> 06:33.955
Comes out on the other side, it goes something like this.

06:33.955 --> 06:42.016
[Music.]

06:42.016 --> 06:44.569
Oh boy, we're going downhill now, ain't we?

06:44.730 --> 06:46.432
Yeah, we're going downhill.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.495
We're fixing to pull into the next town.

06:48.515 --> 06:49.596
What is that, Fort Worth?

06:50.057 --> 06:52.219
Could be.

06:52.280 --> 06:56.425
Pulling into the station now.

06:56.425 --> 07:07.424
[Music.]

07:07.424 --> 07:08.285
All out.

07:08.305 --> 07:09.748
Yes, sir, there it is, friends.

07:10.108 --> 07:11.751
The old orange blossom special.

07:11.771 --> 07:13.493
That's mighty fine fiddling there, Jack.

07:13.874 --> 07:15.777
We hope that all our friends enjoyed that.

07:16.558 --> 07:20.384
We've got to be sure, friends, about this watershed deal I was telling you about there.

07:21.827 --> 07:24.731
We've just got to be careful.

07:24.751 --> 07:28.797
One of the worst things that we've got, the thing we've got to watch is fire.

07:28.817 --> 07:30.320
It all adds up to one point.

07:31.101 --> 07:31.902
Fire.

07:31.922 --> 07:34.967
We've got to keep fire out of this stream's watershed.

07:35.639 --> 07:43.207
And we won't have these flash floods and these sudden rush of water and all that sort of stuff.

07:43.627 --> 07:47.071
Well, the grazing would be better for the grass because it's not burned up.

07:47.591 --> 07:55.860
The timber, looking at it from a timber standpoint, we've got the little trees coming on, even the little seedlings and all that sort of stuff.

07:56.621 --> 08:02.627
Acorns that the wildlife feed zone, hogs, stock, and all that sort of stuff.

08:02.667 --> 08:03.888
They eat the acorns and things.

08:03.928 --> 08:04.549
We need these.

08:05.002 --> 08:32.933
Don't you see I mean it takes it all? You can't just take one thing out of it. It takes it all to make a whole. I I just can't make myself clear but one thing I can tell you this and make it clear we have got to keep fire out of the woods. 
And as I said these these floods no nobody wants a flood. Well that's one of the reasons we have floods. You take in the wintertime. Anybody knows it's snow out in the woods. It takes it several days longer to melt

08:33.503 --> 08:36.668
and to get away from out in the woods than it does out in an open field.

08:36.688 --> 08:37.850
Well, you know that.

08:37.870 --> 08:43.900
Well, naturally, that gives the ground more chance to take up this water and take care of it.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.986
If it all melted at once and rushed into the river, well, we'd have a big flood.

08:49.028 --> 08:49.909
See, it all adds up.

08:49.949 --> 08:50.811
It makes sense, don't it?

08:51.612 --> 08:52.273
Yes, it does.

08:52.353 --> 08:53.655
I want you to keep that in mind.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.899
Well, here we go with another tune here.

08:55.939 --> 08:57.942
Herman's going to play this one on his steel guitar.

08:58.563 --> 09:00.285
His double bell guitar, that is.

09:00.305 --> 09:03.109
And he's doing a tune here called Draggin' the Steel.

09:03.109 --> 10:20.086
[Music.]

10:20.086 --> 10:24.151
All right there, Herman.

10:24.171 --> 10:24.812
Thank you, son.

10:24.852 --> 10:26.715
That's what I call a mess of steel.

10:27.375 --> 10:31.401
I'm telling you, did you ever hear such a weird thing come out of a steel guitar?

10:31.521 --> 10:33.724
Any of you friends out there listening got a steel guitar?

10:34.144 --> 10:36.527
See if you can get something weird out of yours like that.

10:36.547 --> 10:37.669
Herman, that's mighty good, son.

10:38.129 --> 10:40.773
Well, we've still got a few minutes left here.

10:40.793 --> 10:42.455
I just had a look at my old watch.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.576
We've got a few minutes left.

10:44.257 --> 10:49.384
And I would like to remind you again, friends, that you can't be too careful with your cigarettes, matches,

10:50.123 --> 10:53.249
burning your brush piles, all that sort of stuff.

10:53.289 --> 11:03.829
If you go out camping and you have an occasion to build a fire to make you a bucket of coffee or for any reason, don't forget you can't be too careful.

11:03.849 --> 11:06.313
And when you get ready to leave, make sure the fire is out.

11:06.413 --> 11:08.397
It only takes a minute or two.

11:08.417 --> 11:12.064
And if you had a good time and enjoyed yourself there, you might want to come back.

11:12.702 --> 11:18.568
Well, who in the world wants to go to a place that's all burned over in charcoal and ashes and old smutty sticks and things around?

11:18.588 --> 11:21.611
You ever see anybody go out in a burnt-over field and have a picnic?

11:23.272 --> 11:23.873
Isn't that awful?

11:23.913 --> 11:29.178
A pool cat won't even go out in a burnt-over field, much less a man, a human being.

11:29.198 --> 11:30.960
So we can't be too careful, friends.

11:32.081 --> 11:34.183
You have to watch your cigarettes and that kind of thing.

11:34.223 --> 11:38.187
When you're driving down the highway, you've got an ashtray right there at your fingertips.

11:38.993 --> 11:41.275
And every car today has got an ashtray in it.

11:41.436 --> 11:42.757
Put your cigarette in the ashtray.

11:42.797 --> 11:44.559
Don't pump it out the window there.

11:44.979 --> 11:46.641
Might start a serious fire.

11:46.941 --> 11:49.924
Use 50, 75 miles on down the road.

11:49.944 --> 11:52.086
Well, we've run out of time, neighbors.

11:52.126 --> 11:53.047
We're going to have to go here.

11:53.148 --> 11:57.011
Before we go, though, here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you.

11:57.912 --> 11:58.893
I want you to think it over.

11:59.814 --> 12:07.262
Forest and water go together like pictures in a book, providing, that is, you keep fire out.

12:07.698 --> 12:14.307
And don't let the land get cooked.

12:25.461 --> 12:26.523
Well, friends, there it is.

12:27.905 --> 12:31.650
It brings to a close our little visit here with you under the old pine tree.

12:33.432 --> 12:37.317
We sincerely hope that you've enjoyed it, because we have.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.462
And we want you to come our way again.

12:39.522 --> 12:41.244
We'll come your way and you come our way.

12:42.326 --> 12:45.149
Come in and sit under the old fine tree with us a while.

12:45.169 --> 12:47.672
The local announcer will let you know when we'll be back.

12:48.453 --> 12:50.656
The date and time and stuff and things.

12:51.938 --> 12:55.903
So just stay tuned.

12:55.923 --> 13:07.017
Remember, friends, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own state forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service.

13:08.212 --> 13:14.251
with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:14.271 --> 13:19.588
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

13:19.588 --> 14:15.000
[Music.]

14:15.000 --> 14:24.000
[Silence.]
