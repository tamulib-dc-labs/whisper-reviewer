WEBVTT

00:34.726 --> 00:39.532
Well, that's all right there, Charlie, that's it.

00:39.672 --> 00:42.396
Yeah, here we come at you again, friends, with both barrels.

00:42.756 --> 00:44.979
I want you to pull up a pine knot there and have a seat.

00:45.019 --> 00:52.108
That's to the boys, myself, sitting here on the old pine tree, and we're going to do our best to play some tunes here that you're going to like.

00:52.909 --> 00:54.912
So make yourself comfortable there.

00:55.094 --> 00:59.685
And gather around, children, because we're going to open a cag of nails and all go driving here.

01:00.005 --> 01:12.073
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service, along with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

01:12.830 --> 01:16.239
Well, we're going to get things started off here with Robert and his fiddle.

01:16.259 --> 01:16.941
Yes, sir.

01:16.961 --> 01:23.198
He's going to come up here and play an old hoedown that we get lots of requests for the thing from time to time.

01:23.619 --> 01:26.046
And here it is, Ragtime Annie.

02:05.210 --> 02:30.863
Well, I declare, Robert, I'll tell you, you made me drop my hat there.

02:30.903 --> 02:35.048
I got some, I'll tell you, that's a good old ragtime in it.

02:35.332 --> 02:46.796
Friends, you know, did you ever stop to think that the youngsters, the youngsters, people that's got youngsters, just like trees, they're a lot alike.

02:46.876 --> 02:54.792
Now, I've got kids, I've got some children myself, and I've noticed that they're just alike in a lot of ways.

02:55.598 --> 02:58.543
Most of them start off in life, they're pretty scrawny.

02:58.563 --> 03:00.646
They're pretty scrawny.

03:01.147 --> 03:09.099
But both the youngsters and the trees and the woods and forests, they grow up and develop into both the, you know, they come right on up together there.

03:09.480 --> 03:14.087
And they amount to something if they're raised and protected and treated right.

03:14.107 --> 03:16.491
Now, I'm not going to try to tell you how to raise your kids.

03:16.511 --> 03:17.252
That's up to you.

03:17.372 --> 03:20.577
I mean, I'm just merely trying to compare...

03:20.962 --> 03:48.707
children with trees that they are a lot alike and I know there's a lot of you out there has never stopped to think about that now there's not a kid in the world I'll guarantee you there's not a kid alive that don't like trees and woods and forests and all just any child you take these poor little fellas that's raised around in town that's their longing desire to get out in the woods and walk around if you want to make him happy just take him some Sunday out and let him stroll around in the woods and pick flowers and

03:48.991 --> 03:56.180
And gather a few green leaves and all that and breathe that good, clean, pure air that's sifted through the trees out there in the woods.

03:56.581 --> 03:57.722
That's the nicest thing.

03:58.443 --> 03:59.264
Kids like that.

03:59.344 --> 04:05.072
And I do believe if trees could talk that they would tell you that youngsters is their favorite too.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.194
Any kid is good at heart.

04:07.555 --> 04:09.898
Every kid.

04:10.078 --> 04:15.505
All they need is just the right raising and taking care of them.

04:16.666 --> 04:18.488
It's just like the old saying, friends.

04:18.509 --> 04:23.075
The old saying goes, you know, as the twig is bent, so does the tree grow.

04:23.475 --> 04:24.777
Well, that's it.

04:24.837 --> 04:26.179
That's the whole thing in a nutshell.

04:26.840 --> 04:32.728
I could go on and talk to you here for an hour on that very same thing, comparing children with trees.

04:32.748 --> 04:35.772
But I guess I better not do that, because I know a lot of you is already...

04:36.376 --> 04:38.038
squirming around there wanting to hear a tune.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.142
But you just stop and think that thing over.

04:40.162 --> 04:44.248
You mothers and dads out there, you just think about how much your children's like trees.

04:44.268 --> 04:45.850
But they've got to be taken care of.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.975
Trees have got to be taken care of and looked after just like children.

04:48.995 --> 04:50.477
You've got to keep the fire out.

04:50.497 --> 04:53.541
Here's the first tune, and it's a hymn.

04:53.622 --> 05:00.432
All the boys and myself go together around the micacophone here and sing a beautiful old hymn.

05:00.932 --> 05:04.678
I know everybody loves a hymn, so we're going to do our best on it, friends.

05:04.878 --> 05:08.342
Where could I go but to the Lord?

05:08.362 --> 05:33.130
Living below in this old sinful world Hardly a comfort can afford Striving alone to face temptation sore Where could I go but to the Lord?

05:38.003 --> 05:40.066
Where could I go?

05:40.747 --> 05:45.854
Seeking a refuge for my soul.

05:47.316 --> 05:52.804
Needing a friend to save me in the end.

05:53.805 --> 05:58.392
Where could I go but to the Lord?

06:00.278 --> 06:24.767
Neighbours are kind, I love them, everyone We get along in sweet accord But when my soul needs manna from above Where could I go but to the Lord?

06:31.733 --> 06:56.120
Seeking a refuge for my soul Needing a friend to save me in the end Where could I go but to the love?

06:56.140 --> 06:56.881
Thank you, boys.

06:56.901 --> 06:57.181
Thank you.

06:57.201 --> 06:57.842
There it is.

06:58.717 --> 07:04.923
I know there's a lot of you old-timers out there that enjoyed that tune, and we enjoyed trying to sing it for you.

07:06.144 --> 07:16.914
Friends, on the same subject here of talking about comparing children with trees and all, you know a lot of fathers and mothers, they don't pay enough attention to their children.

07:18.015 --> 07:23.861
I know of a little incident happened the other day, and I really know that this happened.

07:23.881 --> 07:26.023
There was a man in the grocery store.

07:26.476 --> 07:28.379
shopping, getting the groceries.

07:28.399 --> 07:29.821
It was on a Saturday afternoon.

07:31.123 --> 07:37.173
And he's got a little boy, a very bright little fella, and this man lives out in the woods near me.

07:38.836 --> 07:46.027
And this little boy likes the woods and all that, and he's made a practice of letting his child play with his cigarette lighter.

07:46.047 --> 07:52.197
So while he was in the store getting the groceries, he was talking to somebody there, and the little boy was pulling on his

07:52.430 --> 07:55.614
pants leg there, and says, Daddy, give me your lighter.

07:55.634 --> 07:56.615
Daddy, give me your lighter.

07:56.656 --> 08:10.233
Well, his father just unconscious-like pulled out his lighter and gave it to the child, and next thing he knew, well, his coat was on fire and had burned about a third of his coat off before he realized he was on fire.

08:10.854 --> 08:20.867
He wasn't paying any attention to the child, and he'd been in the habit of playing with the cigarette lighter at the house, and he didn't know any better, and he just hauled off and set his daddy's coat on fire.

08:21.337 --> 08:23.819
Well, now, that wasn't the child's fault.

08:23.839 --> 08:24.980
That was his daddy's fault.

08:26.322 --> 08:30.005
He shouldn't have ever let the kid play with a cigarette lighter to start with.

08:30.225 --> 08:39.193
While that little fellow comes on up like that, he's in the habit of playing with fire and all, he'll get out in the woods and be careless with fire, and he's really not to be blamed.

08:39.834 --> 08:51.124
I'll tell you, if you'll teach those children to be careful with fire around the house, well, they'll just automatically be careful after they get grown

08:51.408 --> 09:04.664
I know there's a lot of you out there know of instances where people have went off and left their kids in the room, and maybe one of them would get a box of matches and strike a match and set the house on fire, maybe burn up everything they've had, maybe lose one or two of the children.

09:05.285 --> 09:11.012
Fire is one of the most dangerous things in the world, friends, and we just can't be too careful with it.

09:11.032 --> 09:15.157
And I just want to caution you about that with children.

09:15.177 --> 09:19.963
Now, all you little boys and little girls out there listening, you listening to old Jelly Elliott here,

09:20.129 --> 09:22.611
We like to have you listen, and we like to play for you.

09:22.952 --> 09:25.134
But you don't ever fool with them matches and things.

09:25.174 --> 09:25.815
That's bad.

09:26.155 --> 09:27.156
That's bad business.

09:27.596 --> 09:33.262
You take all them movie stars, Roy Rogers and Gene Autren, all those fellas.

09:33.282 --> 09:39.007
If they could see you and talk to you, they'd tell you not to mess with matches or cigarette lighters or anything like that.

09:39.027 --> 09:42.811
Because once fire gets started, boy, it takes something to stop it.

09:43.232 --> 09:44.152
So be careful.

09:44.172 --> 09:44.953
Don't fool with them.

09:44.993 --> 09:48.837
Just don't let nobody catch you fooling with a match or a cigarette lighter.

09:49.289 --> 09:57.480
Now we're going to play another tune here, especially for all the little boys and girls out there and their mothers and fathers that's got little boys and little girls.

09:58.702 --> 10:00.484
I want to do this tune especially for you.

10:01.205 --> 10:03.027
Al Jolson done a good job on it.

10:03.047 --> 10:05.391
Of course, mine's not so hot, but I'll do the best I can.

10:05.451 --> 10:06.732
Here it is, Sonny Boy.

10:15.024 --> 10:18.368
Precious hands and big brown eyes

10:18.770 --> 10:43.326
Makes our home a paradise He's our darling, precious little, sunny boy Tottering feet that just can walk Precious lips that try to tall He's our darling, precious little, sunny boy

10:44.825 --> 11:12.857
He's our little ray of sunshine from heaven above We could hardly live without him Our baby we love Though his little head is bald Still we love him best of all He's our darling, precious little, sunny boy

11:44.967 --> 11:51.995
He's our little ray of sunshine from heaven above.

11:52.615 --> 11:55.638
We could hardly live without him.

11:56.419 --> 11:59.142
Our baby we love.

11:59.863 --> 12:02.766
Though his little head is bald.

12:03.587 --> 12:06.470
Till we love him best of all.

12:07.351 --> 12:10.114
He's our darling, precious little.

12:15.157 --> 12:15.858
Thank you, boys.

12:15.878 --> 12:16.219
Thank you.

12:16.239 --> 12:16.820
There it is.

12:16.840 --> 12:17.361
Sonny boy.

12:17.381 --> 12:21.629
I hope all you little boys out there and little girls enjoyed that tune just a whole lot.

12:21.669 --> 12:22.871
We're about to run out of time.

12:22.891 --> 12:24.594
We're going to have to sort of move along here.

12:24.974 --> 12:28.761
But here is just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you, friends.

12:28.881 --> 12:29.863
I want you to listen to it.

12:30.805 --> 12:37.637
When you teach a youngster to always be careful with the fire around the house, now you're building a citizen...

12:37.921 --> 12:54.006
who will always be careful with fire in the woods.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.794
Well, friends, we've run out of time again.

12:58.054 --> 13:00.657
Doggone it, can't do much about it, but we will be back.

13:01.037 --> 13:13.588
The announcer on the station here will let you know when we'll be back, and we want you to come in and set with us another spell under the old pine tree, and we hope that you've enjoyed this program just half as much as we've enjoyed bringing it to you.

13:13.949 --> 13:23.537
Now, don't forget, friends, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service,

13:23.517 --> 13:27.302
with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:28.003 --> 13:48.951
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:53.740 --> 13:57.338
Thank you.
