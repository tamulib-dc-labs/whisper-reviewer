00:00.000 --> 00:12.687
[Silence.]

00:12.687 --> 00:24.043
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:24.463 --> 00:26.226
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:26.246 --> 00:27.988
That was how he got his name.

00:28.489 --> 00:29.390
Hi there, friends.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.174
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:32.194 --> 00:34.017
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:34.918 --> 00:40.145
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.188
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:43.197 --> 00:46.542
That's because we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:46.562 --> 00:51.588
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:52.510 --> 00:58.778
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the Sons of the Pioneers.

00:59.539 --> 01:00.561
Hi, fellas.

01:00.581 --> 01:02.543
Isn't it great to be hitting the trail again?

01:03.084 --> 01:04.005
Oh, you betcha, Billy.

01:04.045 --> 01:08.952
And speaking for all the Sons, we're really glad to be back plugging for Smokey Bearer

01:09.117 --> 01:12.020
in his nationwide forest fire prevention program.

01:12.601 --> 01:18.127
I say his program, but it's really our program, yours and mine and every American's.

01:19.028 --> 01:24.093
We've just got to cut down on the carelessness that starts so many forest fires.

01:24.113 --> 01:26.936
We sons of the pioneers are sure going to keep doing our little bit.

01:27.517 --> 01:32.723
We're going to tell more about our own experiences in the woods and forests and on the range.

01:32.743 --> 01:38.449
And we're going to sing the kind of songs that folks have written in asking for, outdoor songs that we hope

01:38.885 --> 01:45.596
will bring home the meaning of this drive against forest fires all over the country, east, west, north, and south.

01:46.457 --> 01:52.287
Now, to start off this new series of programs, we've picked an opener called The Song of the Bandit.

01:53.328 --> 01:58.276
Of course, a wildfire in the woods or on the range is a bandit of the worst kind.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.341
Maybe that's what caused us to pick this song.

02:02.042 --> 02:03.945
At any rate, the title sure fits.

02:04.366 --> 02:05.668
The Song of the Bandit.

02:06.897 --> 02:18.253
Long, long ago in old Wyoming lived a maid, Fair as the sweetest flower, blooming in the shade.

02:18.754 --> 02:25.483
She loved a bandit who roamed the prairie o'er, And every night she'd listen for his call.

02:25.543 --> 02:33.715
Then far to the west his voice came ringing, Riding a wild horse he came singing, Healy-ole-yip-bye-ole-yay.

02:34.471 --> 02:41.420
He brings a token of his love.

02:42.281 --> 02:50.150
Swift as the wind, he goes high in the hills, he knows she's waiting.

02:52.814 --> 02:59.502
One day he rode away, but never to return.

03:00.083 --> 03:03.567
Danger was waiting, now his love must ever yearn.

03:03.833 --> 03:07.377
Long days and lonely nights, she waited all in vain.

03:07.718 --> 03:10.361
Till winter passed and summer came again.

03:11.603 --> 03:15.828
Till every night when the moon came shining, for his song her heart was pining.

03:15.848 --> 03:19.072
Healy-ole-yip-eye-ole-yay.

03:19.853 --> 03:23.838
Healy-ole-yip-eye-ole-yip-eye-ole-yay.

03:23.858 --> 03:26.982
He brings a token of his love.

03:27.843 --> 03:31.147
Swift as the wind, he goes high in the hills.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.570
He knows she's waiting for.

03:34.276 --> 03:45.412
One night an angel brought a message from her love.

03:45.772 --> 03:49.297
Told her he waited in the starlit sky above.

03:49.758 --> 03:53.243
Softly she closed her eyes and bade the angel go.

03:53.583 --> 03:56.908
And then the whole world echoed to his song.

03:57.260 --> 04:27.013
For straight down the moonbeam he came riding Out of the sky on the winged horse gliding Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay. 
He brings a token of his love Swift as a wind, he goes high in the hills He knows she's waiting for his Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay

04:27.955 --> 04:35.065
Song of the Bandit.

04:35.846 --> 04:38.310
And can't the boys sing those outdoor songs?

04:39.251 --> 04:40.933
They're a fine bunch, all right.

04:40.953 --> 04:47.082
Tommy Doss, the Farr brothers, Hugh and Carl, Shook Fisher, Lloyd Perryman, and Dale Warren.

04:48.264 --> 04:54.773
I'm sure glad we're here on this trail together, working with Smokey Bear to prevent forest, woods, and range fires.

04:55.816 --> 05:02.564
You know, this is a wonderful country we live in, and a lot of people are finding out more and more just how wonderful.

05:03.205 --> 05:08.332
Every year, more and more Americans are picnicking and camping out.

05:08.352 --> 05:12.677
Applications for hunting and fishing licenses are going up enough.

05:12.697 --> 05:18.164
Yes, sir, many folks are seeing for themselves the other practical uses of the forest by man.

05:18.905 --> 05:19.866
For wood products,

05:20.335 --> 05:25.480
and as a source of clean water for power, industry, irrigation, and domestic use.

05:26.641 --> 05:29.424
I'm hoping you've seen these things yourself.

05:29.444 --> 05:32.127
If not, that you've got a pretty good picture in your mind.

05:33.388 --> 05:37.973
Just talking about it, for example, makes me think of someone I'm very fond of.

05:40.335 --> 05:47.322
I see my darling in each fray of summer sunlight.

05:48.010 --> 06:15.537
I see my darlin' in the leaves that fall. I see her walkin' in the rainy April sadness And hear her name in every bluebird call. I've told the possum in 
the gum tree, the raccoon on the ground

06:16.090 --> 06:44.393
I told everyone but my darling of the happiness I found. My heart would cry more than the weeping willow tree if my darling and her heart were not for me. 
I told the possum in the gum tree,

06:45.976 --> 07:14.953
the raccoon on the ground, told everyone but my darling of the happiness I found. My heart would cry more than the weeping willow tree if my darling and her heart were not for me

07:15.743 --> 07:19.948
Yes, sir, the possum in the gum tree and the raccoon on the ground.

07:21.150 --> 07:25.175
We sure need the woods and forests for homes and food for wildlife.

07:26.356 --> 07:30.561
And just add to this the other things our forests give us.

07:30.581 --> 07:37.090
Wood and water, outdoor sport and recreation, not to mention beauty.

07:37.110 --> 07:41.515
And we've got plenty of reasons to try to keep them from burning up by carelessness.

07:42.490 --> 07:50.830
Believe me, friends, by working together, we can cut down the terrible toll that man caused fires take every year.

07:50.850 --> 07:54.458
We can do it, and that's no idle dream.

07:54.478 --> 07:56.543
But here's a different kind of dreaming entirely.

07:57.385 --> 08:00.212
Let's listen while the sons of the pioneers tell us about it.

08:05.103 --> 08:34.215
Sunset and twilight's falling I've been on the range all day I realize I've been closing my eyes

08:34.735 --> 08:43.463
And dreamin' the hours away

08:46.531 --> 09:14.412
the day in my saddle I sway visions grow as I go trail dreaming. I see a home on a blue mountain dome...

09:14.948 --> 09:27.102
There's a rainbow there all lined

09:33.038 --> 10:01.476
with stars and it feeds to a gate of moonbeam bars, and it's welcome I feel till my vision so real turns to dust for I'm just dreaming.

10:01.844 --> 10:11.857
That was real pretty, wasn't it?

10:12.718 --> 10:19.527
Well, while the boys were singing, I was just sitting here thinking about the different kinds of music you can hear in the woods or in the forest.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.930
Now, there's the kind of music you've just heard.

10:22.631 --> 10:30.822
And then there's nature's own harmony, the song of the birds, the sound of water bubbling over rocks, the soft winds,

10:32.084 --> 10:38.596
And then there's another kind, full of crackling and agonizing discords.

10:38.616 --> 10:40.199
You hear it when fire gets loose.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.805
There's a challenge in all this for you and me.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.272
We can master wildfire if we only try.

10:48.755 --> 10:50.357
Now, Wild Horse is another story.

10:51.099 --> 10:53.383
Here are the sons of the pioneers to tell you all about it.

10:57.143 --> 11:00.728
Old Skyball paint was a devil's saint, his eyes were a fiery red.

11:01.008 --> 11:04.733
Good men have tried this horse to ride, and all of them are dead.

11:04.753 --> 11:08.198
Now I won't brag, but I rode this nag till his blood began to boil.

11:08.558 --> 11:11.943
And I hit the ground and ate three pounds of good old western soil.

11:12.203 --> 11:17.610
Singing hi-ho, whoops, die-oh, ride him high, down you go, son of the western soil.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.453
Son of the western soil.

11:19.853 --> 11:23.198
I swore by heck I'd break his neck for the jolt he gave my pride.

11:23.598 --> 11:27.083
I threw my noose on that old caillou stand once more, took a ride.

11:27.215 --> 11:30.985
He turned around and soon I found his head where his tail should be.

11:31.005 --> 11:34.253
So I says perhaps he's shy or he just don't care for me.

11:34.774 --> 11:40.228
Singing hi-ho, whoopee-die-oh, ride him high and down you go, sons of the western soil, sons of the western soil.

11:42.301 --> 11:45.686
In town one day I chanced to stray upon old Sheriff Jim.

11:46.127 --> 11:49.852
For a hoop and a holler and a counterfeit dollar I sold that nag to him.

11:49.872 --> 11:57.022
But when he plants the seat of his pants in Skyball's leather chair, I'll bet four bits when Skyball quits old Jim just won't be there.

11:57.403 --> 12:01.288
Singing hi-ho, whoopee-tie-ho, ride him high and down you go.

12:01.348 --> 12:07.177
Sons of the western soil, sons of the western soil, sons of the western soil.

12:07.197 --> 12:10.722
Sons of the western soil.

12:13.368 --> 12:15.211
Well, look who's coming up the trail now.

12:15.231 --> 12:20.019
Big as life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all togged out in dungarees.

12:20.039 --> 12:23.064
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

12:23.084 --> 12:28.713
He's the popular candidate, the people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:29.274 --> 12:32.679
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:32.699 --> 12:34.482
Hello there, folks.

12:34.748 --> 12:43.838
Seeing as how I'm a full-fledged, non-potterson candidate looking for your support, you'll want to know what kind of a platform I'm running on.

12:43.858 --> 12:44.479
Here it is.

12:45.019 --> 12:50.986
I'm for green, productive forests, clear lakes, and clean, steady-running streams.

12:51.006 --> 12:55.270
Enough food to go around for livestock and for my wildlife friends.

12:55.671 --> 12:58.634
Pretty campgrounds and picnic spots.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.877
I'm for woods and forests free from wildfire.

13:02.398 --> 13:03.439
How about you?

13:04.229 --> 13:06.172
And there he goes down the trail.

13:07.194 --> 13:08.195
Thank you, Smokey.

13:10.099 --> 13:13.043
Well, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:13.865 --> 13:16.629
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:17.491 --> 13:26.305
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:27.365 --> 13:39.342
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:39.362 --> 13:45.111
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:45.932 --> 13:50.098
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

13:50.450 --> 13:55.081
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:55.101 --> 13:58.869
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

13:59.230 --> 14:03.420
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:03.981 --> 14:08.391
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:08.371 --> 14:12.617
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:13.358 --> 14:17.244
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

14:17.624 --> 14:21.970
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:21.970 --> 14:41.887
[Music.]
