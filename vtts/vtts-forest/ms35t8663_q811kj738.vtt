00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[Silence.]

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
[Music.]

00:17.000 --> 00:21.316
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:21.697 --> 00:23.399
That's why they call us Smokey.

00:23.439 --> 00:25.161
That was how he got his name.

00:25.602 --> 00:26.563
Hi there, friends.

00:26.743 --> 00:29.387
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:29.407 --> 00:32.271
Glad you could come this way up the trail again today.

00:32.291 --> 00:37.538
So how about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:37.558 --> 00:39.420
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:40.362 --> 00:44.566
That's because we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.249
You know, with a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:47.309 --> 00:51.354
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there.

00:51.654 --> 00:53.716
The sons of the pioneers.

00:53.736 --> 00:56.079
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail, too.

00:56.099 --> 01:02.185
And now that you're here and comfortably settled, they're going to start off this little outdoor get-together of ours.

01:02.205 --> 01:09.593
So just relax and let's hear some mighty fine singing, huh?

01:10.045 --> 01:18.641
I have heard the thunder rollin' out across the mountains high, where the wind is singin' through the clouds, and driftin' through the sky.

01:18.761 --> 01:22.227
It's the song of the trail.

01:22.989 --> 01:27.637
It's the song of the trail. 

01:27.637 --> 01:29.421 
Thunder crashing, lightning flashing on the mountain trail.

01:29.421 --> 01:33.488
I have seen those yawnin' canyons, and I've climbed the highest peak.

01:33.468 --> 01:37.652
I've felt the wind, the sun, and rain upon a carefree cheek.

01:37.672 --> 01:41.816
It's the song of the trail.

01:41.896 --> 01:44.739
It's the song of the trail.

01:44.759 --> 01:48.002
Yawning canyons to companions on a mountain trail.

01:48.323 --> 01:52.227
I have seen the burst of glory and I've felt the mighty hand.

01:52.607 --> 01:56.631
The one who made all this out here and made me what I am.

01:56.651 --> 02:00.775
I have heard the timbers singing and the mighty rivers roar.

02:00.755 --> 02:04.881
And a hymn of hymns to mountain men, I'll hear it evermore.

02:04.981 --> 02:09.047
It's the song of the trail.

02:09.167 --> 02:11.911
It's the song of the trail.

02:11.931 --> 02:15.256
Timbers singing, voices ringing on a mountain trail.

02:15.576 --> 02:19.842
I have seen the burst of glory and I've felt the mighty hand.

02:19.862 --> 02:23.828
The one who made all this out here and made me what I am.

02:23.848 --> 02:27.994
I have heard the timbers singing and the mighty rivers roar.

02:27.974 --> 02:32.139
And a hymn of hymns to mountain men, I'll hear it evermore.

02:32.159 --> 02:35.684
It's the song of the trail.

02:36.345 --> 02:39.088
It's the song of the trail.

02:39.108 --> 02:42.472
Timber singing, voices ringing on a mountain trail.

02:42.833 --> 02:48.700
The song of the trail.

02:51.224 --> 02:52.345
Song of the Trail.

02:53.658 --> 03:00.270
Now there's an invitation to every one of us to enjoy the wonders and the pleasures of the great American outdoors.

03:01.051 --> 03:03.416
But that invitation carries with it a little plea.

03:04.538 --> 03:06.621
That we be careful with fire.

03:06.641 --> 03:08.064
Always.

03:08.084 --> 03:16.459
The simple truth, friends, is that nine out of every ten forest fires are caused by human carelessness or thoughtlessness.

03:17.536 --> 03:31.390
Now, this kind of place is a responsibility on every American, man, woman, and child, to assume his individual part of the job in keeping our woods and forests and the rangeland, too, free from fire.

03:32.631 --> 03:38.557
Believe me, friends, it isn't always the other fellow who's careless and lets fire break away.

03:39.518 --> 03:43.582
It can be you or me, too, if we're not careful.

03:43.602 --> 03:45.484
So, dear hearts and gentle people,

03:45.953 --> 03:49.901
that leaves it squarely up to you and me, doesn't it?

03:49.921 --> 04:03.270
I love the dear hearts and gentle people who live in my hometown because the dear hearts

04:03.554 --> 04:09.524
And gentle people will never ever let you down.

04:10.465 --> 04:16.815
They read the good book from Friday till Monday.

04:16.835 --> 04:20.621
That's how the weekend goes.

04:20.641 --> 04:29.916
I've got a dream house I'll build there one day with picket pits and rambling roads.

04:30.250 --> 04:40.432
I feel so welcome each day that I return that my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown.

04:40.452 --> 04:49.913
I love the dear hearts and gentle people who live and love in my hometown.

04:50.095 --> 04:59.289
I feel so welcome each day that I return that my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown.

05:00.311 --> 05:09.185
I love the dear hearts and gentle people who live and love in my hometown.

05:11.688 --> 05:17.217
Yes, friends, when it comes to holding down that Red Devil forest fire, you and I,

05:17.922 --> 05:21.829
well, we've got to shoulder our personal responsibility.

05:21.849 --> 05:22.970
And think about it this way.

05:23.612 --> 05:27.077
All of us are pretty careful with fire in the house, aren't we?

05:27.097 --> 05:30.002
Now, we've set up a whole pattern of care with fire at home.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.450
Now, why can't we extend those good habits to when we're outdoors?

05:35.391 --> 05:40.720
For example, you wouldn't toss a lighted match or a burning cigarette down on a living room rug, would you?

05:42.163 --> 05:44.166
Then why do it when you're out in the woods or...

05:44.433 --> 05:48.859
when you're driving along some country road or through the forest.

05:48.879 --> 05:49.460
See what I mean?

05:50.642 --> 05:54.588
Let's spread the good habits and lock up the bad ones once and for all.

05:55.729 --> 05:59.856
That way we can put an end to man-caused forest fires in this country.

06:01.057 --> 06:10.491
We'll be hearing from Smokey Bear soon on the same subject, but in the meantime, I'm sure we can count on the sons of the pioneers to help us in this fight against forest fires.

06:10.792 --> 06:12.154
Can't we, boys?

06:12.174 --> 06:14.797
Ah, you don't need to worry none about us, Billy.

06:14.817 --> 06:18.342
We're the carefulest fellows with fire when we're out that you ever saw.

06:19.183 --> 06:20.024
You bet.

06:20.425 --> 06:23.129
We break every match we use into little pieces.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.011
That way we make sure it's out cold.

06:25.652 --> 06:29.437
Because no one in his right mind will grab the hot end of a match to break it.

06:29.858 --> 06:31.760
You make sure it's out first.

06:31.780 --> 06:32.481
Then you break it.

06:33.202 --> 06:34.504
That's the final test.

06:34.687 --> 06:35.729
Yes, sir.

06:35.749 --> 06:41.920
And when we build a little warming or a campfire, we make sure that baby is out before we leave it.

06:42.521 --> 06:43.423
And dead out.

06:43.924 --> 06:57.268
And, Billy, if everyone would do the same with their matches and outdoor fires, you can bet your life the skies would never be cluttered up with the black clouds of smoke that go rolling up out of a forest on fire.

07:04.133 --> 07:32.183
There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a roof over my head. There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a cupboard for my bed. And wherever I wander Or wherever I may roam There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a-callin' me home.

07:32.399 --> 07:35.254
I'm tired of roaming around

07:35.639 --> 08:04.026
Mighty tired, mighty blue. Somehow I never have found Any place like the home I once knew. There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a roof over my head. There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a cover for my bed. And wherever I wonder

08:04.006 --> 08:14.562
Or wherever I may roam, There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a-calling me home.

08:14.562 --> 08:29.116
[Music.]

08:29.116 --> 08:47.252
And wherever I wander, or wherever I may roam, there's a blue sky way out yonder, that's a-calling me home.

08:47.272 --> 08:50.195
Blue sky way out yonder.

08:50.215 --> 08:52.577
And that's the way it ought to be all the time.

08:53.618 --> 08:55.380
Don't just take my word for it, friends.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.903
There's a fella coming up the trail now who can tell us how to do it.

08:59.609 --> 09:01.491
He's Smokey Bear.

09:01.511 --> 09:03.633
Hello there, folks.

09:04.354 --> 09:05.696
Believe me, folks.

09:06.216 --> 09:11.241
It's up to you to keep the forests and woods green and productive.

09:11.782 --> 09:13.404
And you can do it.

09:13.424 --> 09:17.088
Just come through on these four simple rules.

09:17.708 --> 09:17.849
One.

09:18.509 --> 09:22.594
Crush out your cigarette, cigar, and pipe ashes.

09:23.094 --> 09:24.355
Two.

09:24.375 --> 09:27.299
Break your matches in two after you use them.

09:28.099 --> 09:28.620
Three.

09:29.242 --> 09:34.206
Drown your campfire with water, then stir it and drown it again.

09:35.307 --> 09:43.074
Four, find out all you can about your local and state laws before you use fire outdoors.

09:43.995 --> 09:45.776
That's how you can help, folks.

09:46.757 --> 09:48.138
It's up to you.

09:49.399 --> 09:52.041
Well, I'll be seeing you.

09:52.942 --> 09:55.384
And there he goes down the trail.

09:55.404 --> 09:56.345
Thank you, Smokey.

09:57.726 --> 09:58.607
You know, friend...

09:59.093 --> 10:08.485
I guess if anyone through the years has loved and appreciated all the values of our forests, it's the American Indian.

10:08.505 --> 10:17.477
It's in tribute to these fine people and the part they're playing in keeping our forests green and producing that the sons of the pioneers are doing this next number.

10:18.158 --> 10:19.920
The song is called Nehani.

10:24.372 --> 10:48.895
Long ago t'was here, I know, lived the fairest Indian maid. Daughter of a chieftain brave, here beside the lake she stayed. Far and near the waters clear, blessed her from their deep domain.

10:49.280 --> 10:55.206
Blessed her with this lovely name.

10:55.266 --> 11:03.333
Nehani, it must be she is heaven's daughter.

11:03.353 --> 11:11.741
For her eyes and the skies form the lake's clear water.

11:11.761 --> 11:17.987
Sunlight plays, dancing rays while the littles bless her.

11:20.009 --> 11:39.469
On the shore evermore Where the waves caress her. Far along the shimmering shoal The shallow water's clear. Echo too

11:39.770 --> 12:07.600
To her lovely voice As she is drawing near. See her smile all the while For the sunbeams totter. To be gay all the way Nehani, clear water. Nehani, Nehani.

12:12.187 --> 12:15.490
And that's the story of Nehani.

12:15.510 --> 12:19.654
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail now.

12:19.674 --> 12:21.575
I know you've got a lot of things to do.

12:22.576 --> 12:26.760
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree again.

12:26.780 --> 12:36.408
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service and the station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

12:37.449 --> 12:41.873
Oh, incidentally, our next get-together is going to be the last for a while.

12:42.359 --> 12:43.901
Going to be kind of special, too.

12:44.662 --> 12:49.867
Directed to all of Smokey Bear's junior forest rangers and their moms and dads.

12:50.728 --> 12:59.378
To all of you youngsters and grown-ups alike, be sure to join us when we meet again under the old pine tree.

12:59.398 --> 13:04.123
Until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:04.143 --> 13:09.970
Remember, friends, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:11.249 --> 13:23.119
Well, so long for now from Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and from those wonderful fellows who sing your favorite songs of the outdoors the way you like to hear them, the Sons of the Pioneers.

13:23.820 --> 13:40.935
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name

13:41.202 --> 13:49.453
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:50.134 --> 13:53.780
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

13:54.160 --> 13:58.226
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

13:58.746 --> 14:02.772
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:03.022 --> 14:06.828
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:07.729 --> 14:11.255
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:11.615 --> 14:15.642
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:16.182 --> 14:20.389
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:20.369 --> 14:33.450
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name
