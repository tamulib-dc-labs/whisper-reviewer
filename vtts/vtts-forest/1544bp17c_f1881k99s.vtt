00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
[Silence.]

00:17.851 --> 00:19.994
Smokey the Bear!

00:20.094 --> 00:21.856
Smokey the Bear!

00:23.098 --> 00:24.420
Hello there, folks.

00:24.860 --> 00:28.204
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:28.825 --> 00:33.612
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:33.632 --> 00:37.677
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:37.997 --> 00:39.840
Today, it's Bing Crosby.

00:40.480 --> 00:44.806
Gee, Bing, this is a swell hunting lodge you have here in Elko, Nevada.

00:45.227 --> 00:47.790
But after all, you are one of America's

00:47.990 --> 00:51.456
best-known sportsman and a wonderful entertainer.

00:51.476 --> 00:54.020
All right, Smokey, you can stop pulling my leg.

00:54.060 --> 00:57.486
I'll talk about forest fire prevention, and I'll do it willingly, too.

00:58.568 --> 01:02.935
You know, I like to hunt and fish, and so do millions of my fellow Americans.

01:02.955 --> 01:13.052
And I think that those of us who use rod and gun, we get so much physical and spiritual enjoyment from the forest that we have a special reason, a special responsibility to keep them free from wildfires.

01:14.298 --> 01:15.699
Fires don't burn just trees, you know.

01:15.739 --> 01:17.181
They destroy the nests of birds.

01:17.201 --> 01:18.122
They kill wildlife.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.383
They burn up good hunting areas.

01:19.423 --> 01:22.245
And they ruin fishing streams for years and years to come.

01:23.246 --> 01:25.889
So let's watch our matches and smokes and our campfires.

01:25.909 --> 01:27.710
Let's be careful with fire in our forests.

01:29.212 --> 01:30.333
Well, there's my message, Smokey.

01:31.133 --> 01:31.954
I want to tell you something, too.

01:31.994 --> 01:32.795
It's right from the heart.

01:33.336 --> 01:34.917
Thank you, Mr. Bing Crosby.

01:35.477 --> 01:41.503
And if folks will just take it to their hearts, we'll have less carelessness and less forest fires.

01:41.686 --> 01:48.032
It'll be like old times, maybe, when great herds of buffalo roam Nevada country.

01:48.052 --> 01:51.675
Buffalo, buffalo.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.338
Buffalo, buffalo.

01:55.259 --> 02:00.484
They're gone from the plains of Montana.

02:00.604 --> 02:02.566
Buffalo, buffalo.

02:03.607 --> 02:08.191
There's none left in old Idaho.

02:08.291 --> 02:11.254
Buffalo, buffalo.

02:11.707 --> 02:21.144
No longer there's thunder, just bleached bones lie under the snow.

02:21.164 --> 02:27.355
Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.

02:28.297 --> 02:33.927
The great shaggy herds fed the Indians.

02:33.947 --> 02:35.790
Buffalo, buffalo.

02:36.479 --> 02:43.966
From the Sioux down to old Mexico.

02:44.869 --> 02:48.362
Now prairie wind sigh.

02:49.507 --> 02:55.255
Tell of the dying they love.

02:55.815 --> 03:00.561
Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.

03:02.003 --> 03:08.792
Many a humpback bull felt the arrow sting.

03:10.294 --> 03:17.083
Winchesters blazed away to down the prairie king.

03:18.633 --> 03:42.936
Where is the thrill of the rumbling Buffalo, Buffalo Of ten million holes pounding on Buffalo, Buffalo A few lines of history will tell of the mystery

03:43.118 --> 04:01.962
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:02.363 --> 04:04.525
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:04.946 --> 04:09.632
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service,

04:09.865 --> 04:10.326
U.S.

04:10.366 --> 04:15.673
Department of Agriculture and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:16.234 --> 04:30.034
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you

04:30.267 --> 04:32.970
can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:33.210 --> 04:41.881
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, growlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniff in the air.

04:42.582 --> 04:46.486
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:46.867 --> 04:51.432
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:51.432 --> 05:10.419
[Music.]

05:10.419 --> 05:26.000
[Silence.]
