00:00.000 --> 00:13.649
[Silence.]

00:13.649 --> 00:25.888
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:25.948 --> 00:29.854
That's why the call of Smokey, that was how we got his name.

00:30.255 --> 00:33.260
Hi there, friends, I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:34.221 --> 00:36.565
Glad you could come this way up the trail again today.

00:37.046 --> 00:41.833
So how about having the same old seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:42.455 --> 00:45.019
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:45.039 --> 00:48.725
That's cause we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:48.745 --> 00:54.273
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:54.293 --> 00:59.181
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there, the sons of the pioneers.

00:59.650 --> 01:02.313
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail again today, too.

01:02.333 --> 01:08.258
And now that you're here and comfortably settled, they're going to start off this little outdoor get-together of ours.

01:08.278 --> 01:12.002
So just relax and let's hear some mighty fine singing, huh?

01:16.867 --> 01:25.135
Listen to the prairie, read a song from a whale. Listen to him blend us with a nightingale. Winging up above where the dark clouds sail and fly.

01:27.578 --> 01:30.847
I need you.

01:30.947 --> 01:33.133
Listen to the rhythm of the padded feet.

01:33.173 --> 01:35.238
Stealing through the desert, hear his wild heartbeat.

01:35.439 --> 01:39.951
Searching for his love and my heart repeats his cry.

01:41.652 --> 01:44.936
I need you.

01:44.956 --> 01:47.099
Far in the distance, hear that note.

01:47.179 --> 01:54.529
It's born of a call and a savage drove who waits a mate's reply.

01:54.569 --> 01:56.772
Listen to the moaning of the wind on its way.

01:56.952 --> 01:59.075
Everything he touches, see it bend and sway.

01:59.216 --> 02:01.278
Seem to pledge your love and send him on his way.

02:01.298 --> 02:06.580
That's why I need you.

02:08.467 --> 02:36.347
All through the prairie I wander. Night falls and I long for you. Everything here in God's garden shares my longing too. Listen through the prairie weave 
a song from a whale. Listen through the planet with the nightingale. Winging up above where the dark clouds sail and fly.

02:38.386 --> 02:41.413
I need you.

02:41.793 --> 02:43.758
Listen to the rhythm of the padded feet.

02:44.058 --> 02:46.042
Stealing through the desert, hear his wild heartbeat.

02:46.363 --> 02:50.472
Searching for his love and my heart repeats his cry. I need you.

02:55.497 --> 02:57.860
Far in the distance, he'll let know.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.784
It's born of a call in a savage throat who waits.

03:01.425 --> 03:05.149
A mate's reply.

03:05.209 --> 03:07.412
Listen to the mornin' of the wind on his way.

03:07.532 --> 03:09.495
Everything he touches, see it bend and sway.

03:09.735 --> 03:11.778
Seen to pledge alive and send him on his way.

03:11.798 --> 03:17.024
That's why I need you.

03:21.430 --> 03:22.491
Chant of the Plains.

03:23.252 --> 03:23.613
Golly.

03:24.955 --> 03:25.335
You know...

03:25.602 --> 03:35.483
I'm thinking we Americans are more blessed than just about anyone else with our outdoor country and the opportunities we have for good outdoor sports.

03:36.445 --> 03:41.215
Of course, to start with, we've got the forests and woodlands with their streams and lakes.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.560
That's part of our natural heritage.

03:44.367 --> 03:56.819
But even with these resources available, it takes some doing, you know, to protect the fishing waters and keep the forest land producing the wild animals and birds for our pleasure and sport.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.943
This is a field where cooperation plays a mighty big role.

04:00.944 --> 04:12.315
Every hunter and fisherman has a chance to play his part, not only in being a good sport, but in cooperating with the forestry and wildlife men, state and federal alike,

04:13.291 --> 04:21.999
They really work together, the forestry and wildlife boys, to provide us with as good hunting and fishing opportunities as they possibly can.

04:23.000 --> 04:32.068
And they look ahead all the time so that our youngsters, yours and mine, will have the same or even better opportunities.

04:32.088 --> 04:35.892
And talking about youngsters, here's a little song about my boy.

04:37.373 --> 04:40.716
A tiny turned-up nose

04:41.843 --> 05:11.395
Two cheeks just like a rose So sweet from head to toe That little boy of mine Two eyes that shine so bright Two arms that hold me tight Two lips that kiss goodnight That little boy of mine

05:12.640 --> 05:21.375
No one will ever know just what his coming has meant.

05:21.395 --> 05:27.426
Because I love him so, he's something heaven has sent.

05:28.739 --> 05:51.181
He's all the world to me He climbs upon my knees To me he'll always be That little boy of mine Yes, that little boy of mine.

05:51.962 --> 05:58.729
You know, it's because of that little boy of mine and my hope is that he'll have things at least as good as I do

05:59.131 --> 06:04.397
that I can understand why there are bag limits on game and birds and on fish.

06:05.518 --> 06:07.100
There's a good reason for those limits.

06:08.061 --> 06:10.103
Just think what happened to the passenger pigeon.

06:10.723 --> 06:13.086
He's completely extinct now.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.428
Indiscriminate killing helped bring it about.

06:16.369 --> 06:20.534
And once flights of those wonderful birds blackened the sky.

06:20.554 --> 06:29.003
And the buffalo, that grand old shaggy fella, he came close to extinction too until they called a stop to the wholesale killing of buffalo.

06:29.962 --> 06:40.496
Yes, sir, things like this make sense when you take a little time to figure them out and realize what's behind certain so-called restrictions in hunting and fishing.

06:41.638 --> 06:52.512
Now, there are times, as most of you know, when it's necessary to hold up the start of a hunting or fishing season, usually when the danger of forest and woods fires is greatest.

06:53.654 --> 06:56.998
I don't think we ought to complain about that, considering all the reasons.

06:57.434 --> 06:58.235
Do you, Lloyd?

06:58.335 --> 07:09.328
Well, Billy, when a fellow likes to hunt and fish as much as I do and makes plans to get going at it when the season rolls around, well, it does kind of take the edge off when they close the woods.

07:09.929 --> 07:18.279
But golly, that's little enough for a man to give up when the forest is as dry as tender and any little spark will give you a bad fire.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.943
Now, that's the way I look at it.

07:21.203 --> 07:25.248
It's up to all of us to cooperate with the forestry and wildlife boys.

07:25.909 --> 07:26.209
So...

07:26.662 --> 07:31.470
We don't mind putting the gun or rod away until the rains come and wet the forest down.

07:31.970 --> 07:40.344
And meanwhile, we can always go to singing, can't we, boys?

07:40.364 --> 07:49.378
There'll be a hillbilly wedding in June. Oh me, the bells can't be ringing too soon.

07:49.882 --> 07:59.253
The preacher man will be there with a maiden so fair at that hillbilly wedding in June.

08:00.395 --> 08:05.040
As we walk down the aisle, they'll play, I promise you.

08:05.341 --> 08:09.966
Then my ma and my pa walk up and say good luck to you.

08:10.006 --> 08:18.977
We'll be so happy beneath the mountain moon at that hillbilly wedding in June.

08:20.358 --> 08:27.868
Do you take this gal for it to be your wife, to love and cherish all the rest of your life, through storm and strife forevermore?

08:28.088 --> 08:29.090
I'll take the gal.

08:29.150 --> 08:29.691
You will?

08:29.771 --> 08:30.712
Why, sure.

08:30.832 --> 08:34.898
Hillbilly wedding in June.

08:34.918 --> 08:39.184
We'll have a farmhouse our own pretty soon.

08:40.065 --> 08:49.858
And boy, I'll soon educate all the roosters to wait with their cock-a-doodle-doo until June.

08:50.429 --> 08:52.811
You know, I thought we'd live with her folks.

08:53.232 --> 08:54.833
But, gosh, that couldn't be.

08:55.454 --> 08:57.696
Because they still live with their folks.

08:57.977 --> 08:59.678
They were just as smart as me.

08:59.959 --> 09:04.503
Don't be surprised if we disappear too soon.

09:05.224 --> 09:08.968
From that hillbilly wedding in June.

09:13.232 --> 09:16.516
Well, look who's coming up the trail now, big as life.

09:16.536 --> 09:19.879
Yes, sir, it's Smokey Bear, a friend of all who loved the forest.

09:20.332 --> 09:22.294
And he's got a special message for us.

09:23.115 --> 09:24.996
Hello there, folks.

09:25.797 --> 09:39.751
Yes, I've got a special message for you from some of my four-legged friends, the squirrels and raccoons, the deer and rabbits, along with our bird friends and the fish in the streams.

09:39.771 --> 09:46.837
They want me to tell you that they don't mind taking a chance with the legal hunter or fisherman.

09:46.857 --> 09:47.638
It's fire.

09:47.905 --> 09:50.127
running wild through the forest or woods.

09:50.407 --> 09:52.910
That's one of their worst enemies.

09:52.930 --> 09:54.531
Keep that in mind, will you?

09:55.793 --> 09:58.835
Well, I'll be seeing you.

09:59.656 --> 10:01.458
And there it goes on down the trail.

10:01.818 --> 10:02.719
Thank you, Smokey.

10:04.040 --> 10:08.244
And now, friends, we're going to hear a fast-moving instrumental from the sons of the pioneers.

10:08.885 --> 10:17.153
Right out of the bayou country where the wild turkeys fly and the black bear and white-tailed deers still travel over game trails known only to them.

10:17.690 --> 10:19.930
The number is Cajun stomp.

10:19.950 --> 10:20.798
Hit it, boys.

10:20.798 --> 12:30.344 
[Music.]

12:30.344 --> 12:32.106
Yes, sir, the Cajun stomp.

12:33.108 --> 12:36.072
Lively sort of tune, isn't it?

12:36.092 --> 12:39.436
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail.

12:39.517 --> 12:42.361
You've got some things that you want to do, I'm sure.

12:43.242 --> 12:46.426
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree here.

12:47.548 --> 12:58.022
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

12:58.964 --> 13:03.831
Until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:04.733 --> 13:12.144
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:12.164 --> 13:24.422
Well, so long for now from Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and from those wonderful fellas who sing your favorite songs of the outdoors the way you like to hear them, the sons of the pioneers.

13:24.442 --> 13:28.448
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear,

13:28.833 --> 13:46.082
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame. That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name. Smokey the Bear,

13:46.298 --> 14:03.598
Smokey the Bear

14:03.764 --> 14:07.593
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:08.194 --> 14:11.983
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:12.384 --> 14:16.394
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:16.935 --> 14:21.165
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:21.145 --> 14:33.957
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air. He can find a fire before it starts to flame. That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:33.957 --> 15:10.000
[Music.]

15:10.000 --> 15:29.000
[Silence.]
