00:00.000 --> 00:10.072
[Silence.]

00:10.072 --> 00:18.000
[Music.]

00:18.000 --> 00:22.225
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:22.645 --> 00:24.427
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:24.467 --> 00:26.229
That was how he got his name.

00:26.630 --> 00:27.591
Hi there, friends.

00:27.711 --> 00:30.373
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:30.394 --> 00:32.836
Glad you come up this way up the trail again today.

00:33.076 --> 00:38.442
So how about having the same old seat beside me here on this log right under the old pine trees?

00:39.147 --> 00:41.631
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:41.651 --> 00:44.336
That's cause we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:45.498 --> 00:50.187
We thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:50.207 --> 00:55.536
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there, the Sons of the Pioneers.

00:55.536 --> 01:22.162
[Music.]

01:22.162 --> 01:26.071
Listen to the wind. Wonder what he's saying.

01:32.305 --> 01:37.576
See that willow bend.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.681
Everything is livin'.

01:47.643 --> 01:53.790
Seems to be a sadness in the sight of the wind.

02:01.558 --> 02:05.782
Ooh, wonder where he goes.

02:06.844 --> 02:11.929
Darling, can you hear me?

02:16.938 --> 02:39.469
Something that he knows Seems to bring you near me, But I heard you whisper in the silence of the wind.

02:42.470 --> 02:52.168
Sets my weary heart a-longin', yearnin', dreamin'.

02:52.248 --> 03:01.626
Starlight lost its meanin' since you went away.

03:11.410 --> 03:38.970
Now he's burning cold. Wonder if he's lonely. Winter in my soul Longing for you only.

03:43.979 --> 03:53.653
Can't you hear me calling in the sign of the wind?

04:03.588 --> 04:04.169
The wind.

04:05.431 --> 04:10.358
It can be so pleasant at times, so awful, so terrible at other times.

04:11.519 --> 04:24.156
I'm thinking especially of the strong winds that through the years have combined with long periods of drought and human carelessness to give us the disastrous forest fires that blacken the pages of American history.

04:25.298 --> 04:29.223
One of the worst forest fires this country has known happened back in 1871.

04:29.363 --> 04:37.674
It was the Pestigo Fire in Wisconsin, and it began on the same day that the Great Chicago Fire started.

04:37.694 --> 04:41.239
Over a million acres of valuable pine forests were burned out.

04:41.911 --> 04:45.595
Entire towns and communities were destroyed.

04:45.615 --> 04:47.637
1,500 people were killed.

04:48.478 --> 04:51.341
And that was five times as many as in the Chicago Fire.

04:52.202 --> 05:00.651
Now, in Minnesota, 1918, the Cloquet Fire started one October afternoon when the woods were tender dry from lack of rain.

05:01.552 --> 05:06.958
Cloquet, a thriving sawmill town, was gutted and left in ashes.

05:07.979 --> 05:11.243
$30 million worth of timberlands and property

05:11.543 --> 05:13.566
went up and smoked.

05:13.586 --> 05:16.330
400 people died in that fire.

05:16.350 --> 05:21.457
And there have been other terrible forest fires in California, in Oregon, Texas, and in Maine.

05:22.438 --> 05:29.788
Fire is no respecter of places, people, or property when the conditions of weather, wind, and fuel are right for it.

05:30.629 --> 05:36.001
Then it only takes one moment to keep up with one wife to cause untold damage to the mystery.

05:37.364 --> 05:41.955
You know, it's awfully bad, ladies and gentlemen, for fire or any reason.

05:43.117 --> 06:03.825
From this valley they tell me you're leaving. I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile For they say that you take all the sunshine

06:03.805 --> 06:09.036
That has brightened my life for a while.

06:10.760 --> 06:15.750
Then come linger a while before you leave me.

06:17.474 --> 06:21.763
Do not hasten to bid me adieu.

06:21.997 --> 06:44.241
But remember the Red River Valley And the friends who have loved you so true. Do you think of the valley you're leaving?

06:44.221 --> 07:11.528
And the words that you never would say? Do you think of the poor heart you're breaking Just because you are going away? Then come linger a while before you leave me.

07:11.508 --> 07:18.196
Do not hasten to bid me adieu.

07:18.216 --> 07:23.763
But remember the Red River Valley.

07:25.285 --> 07:34.376
And the friends who have loved you so true.

07:34.396 --> 07:38.781
I was talking about the great forest fires we've had in this country.

07:39.284 --> 07:46.835
In nearly every one of those, a single bucket of water thrown on the fire right at the start could have put it out.

07:46.855 --> 07:52.162
Today, the state and federal foresters are better equipped to fight forest fires than they were years ago.

07:52.983 --> 08:00.194
But just the same, putting out a forest fire, especially when it's a roaring, wild-running devil, is mean business.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.337
There's back-breaking work in it and sweat.

08:03.138 --> 08:06.743
And yes, sir, even heartbreak when the fire lines don't hold in the

08:06.925 --> 08:09.688
the men must fall back and hit it again and again.

08:11.029 --> 08:13.492
And yet, that's their job.

08:13.512 --> 08:16.195
Now, what does all that mean to us, to you and me?

08:17.536 --> 08:21.260
Well, sir, for one thing, it takes money to fight a forest fire.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.063
Money that comes out of our pockets when you stop to think about it.

08:24.924 --> 08:34.174
But maybe even more important than that, these natural resources the state and federal foresters protect from destruction, why, these resources belong to us.

08:34.895 --> 08:36.797
And we can help protect them ourselves

08:37.334 --> 08:40.438
just by being careful with fire.

08:40.458 --> 08:43.902
And we ought to keep in mind that ours is an easier job.

08:43.922 --> 08:46.886
We don't face the real danger that the firefighters do.

08:48.088 --> 08:51.232
I know that the sons of the pioneers feel pretty keenly about this, too.

08:51.812 --> 08:52.734
Isn't that right, Lloyd?

08:53.154 --> 08:53.635
Yes, sir.

08:53.915 --> 09:00.864
All over this great country of ours, in one place or another, fellows are going out day after day to fight fire.

09:01.505 --> 09:07.172
Fire that often gets started because somebody is careless or forgets to think for a minute.

09:07.793 --> 09:15.669
And in defense of their country's forests and your welfare and mine, those firefighters sometimes give up their lives.

09:16.591 --> 09:29.177
We want to pay a little tribute to the men of every forest firefighting outfit, public and private alike, who went out to fight fire one day and, well, wound up at the end of the trail.

09:30.695 --> 09:49.149
When an angry storm...And wild winds sweep the sky.

09:49.169 --> 10:03.074
I'm sure that this must be the mystery of his way.

10:03.094 --> 10:04.497
Then comes the glory morn.

10:10.265 --> 10:39.495
And bright new things are born. All this that I may see The mystery of his way. So climb you to the highest mountain And look you to the world below.

10:44.943 --> 11:10.258
Living things drank from his fountain Then reaching for the sky they grow. And in choral voice they sing, This is a wondrous thing.

11:14.002 --> 11:38.997
And he will find a way To speak with you someday. So climb you to the highest mountain And look you to the world below.

11:41.204 --> 12:01.018
Living things drink from his fountain Then reaching for the sky they grow. And in choral voice they sing,

12:02.146 --> 12:21.505
This is a wondrous thing, and he will find a way to speak with you someday, to speak with you some day.

12:33.955 --> 12:35.397
Mystery of his Way.

12:37.119 --> 12:41.846
Yes, friends, human life is far too precious to have it lost in forest fires.

12:43.068 --> 12:49.717
I can't think of a better reason in itself for us to take to heart what Smokey Bear keeps telling us.

12:49.737 --> 12:54.063
And here he comes up the trail now, big as life, with a special message for us.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.787
Hello there, folks.

12:57.628 --> 12:59.170
For the country as a whole,

12:59.572 --> 13:08.620
Nine out of ten forest fires are started through the carelessness of people like you, men, women, and children.

13:09.480 --> 13:22.211
If everyone would just take time to think when he's using fire outdoors, you would be spared the terrible damage forest fires cause every year and the heavy cost of putting them out.

13:23.212 --> 13:29.477
Remember always that only you can prevent forest fires.

13:30.385 --> 13:33.810
Well, I'll be seeing you.

13:33.830 --> 13:35.512
And there he goes down the trail.

13:36.052 --> 13:36.974
Thank you, Smokey.

13:38.376 --> 13:47.748
Friends, you know, it's your own state forestry department along with the United States Forest Service and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:48.769 --> 13:52.855
Until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:52.875 --> 13:57.000
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest fires.

13:57.858 --> 14:02.966
Well, it's so long for now from Billy Johnson, your singing woodman, and the Sons of the Pioneers.

14:03.547 --> 14:11.819
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:12.520 --> 14:16.587
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:16.607 --> 14:20.693
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:21.112 --> 14:29.284
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a sniffin' the air.

14:29.865 --> 14:33.671
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:34.051 --> 14:38.057
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:38.638 --> 14:42.664
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:42.897 --> 14:47.585
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:47.605 --> 14:51.112
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:51.512 --> 14:55.560
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:56.081 --> 15:00.248
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

15:00.413 --> 15:04.304
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

15:05.006 --> 15:08.676
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

15:09.097 --> 15:12.988
That's why they called him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

15:12.988 --> 15:48.000
[Music.]

15:48.000 --> 15:57.000
[Silence.]
