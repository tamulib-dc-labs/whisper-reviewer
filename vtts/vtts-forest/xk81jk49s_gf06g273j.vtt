00:26.795 --> 00:41.493
The Texas Forest Service of A&M College presents a dramatization of an episode in the building of the first railroad in Texas, the BBB&C.

00:48.121 --> 00:53.848
The year is 1855 at the East Texas town of Stafford Point.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.263
And you better give me five pounds of sugar, too.

01:05.623 --> 01:09.667
My wife told me that you wouldn't bake a pie tonight if I forgot the sugar.

01:09.687 --> 01:10.427
All right, Luke.

01:11.248 --> 01:12.569
Where's that sugar scoop?

01:12.849 --> 01:13.470
Oh, here, Keith.

01:14.331 --> 01:15.372
Been working hard lately?

01:15.392 --> 01:16.172
Yep, yep.

01:16.312 --> 01:19.375
Just finished and ordered 200 ties for the railway company.

01:19.796 --> 01:21.917
They're paying 50 cents apiece for them now.

01:22.038 --> 01:22.718
Is that so?

01:23.819 --> 01:25.000
Uh, what are you cutting them out of?

01:25.380 --> 01:26.501
Post oak and cedar.

01:26.782 --> 01:30.585
Post oak's a little hard to work, but I've been making a nice living out of it.

01:31.612 --> 01:33.715
Uh, what size does it have to be of them?

01:34.076 --> 01:38.022
Seven feet long, clear of chipper curve, eight to twelve inches thick.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.326
That's hewn straight on one side.

01:40.907 --> 01:43.731
They're talking about changing the length to eight feet, though.

01:43.751 --> 01:47.257
You know, it sounds like a man could make a lot smart wages out of it.

01:47.898 --> 01:48.579
Here's your sugar.

01:49.360 --> 01:49.901
Anything else?

01:50.282 --> 01:53.727
Might put in some peppermint sticks, about a quarter's worth.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.792
Makes the wise and youngsters feel happy, you know.

01:57.211 --> 02:00.515
I hear they're planning to run the railway across the Brazos.

02:00.735 --> 02:04.599
They should, after naming her the Buffalo Valley of Brazos in Colorado.

02:05.700 --> 02:09.765
The company'd make more money if it could haul freight from farther west.

02:09.785 --> 02:12.027
Well, I hope they go ahead and lay the track.

02:12.248 --> 02:15.271
I'll be able to keep on selling tires to the company.

02:15.291 --> 02:18.374
They'll have to build a pretty good-sized bridge across the Brazos.

02:18.915 --> 02:21.097
In the spring, the water gets up high.

02:21.157 --> 02:24.501
Yeah, they have to build it high enough to let steamboats pass, too.

02:25.173 --> 02:26.115
Well, here's your order.

02:26.395 --> 02:26.956
Anything else?

02:27.056 --> 02:30.062
No, I think that ought to hold me until next Saturday.

02:30.102 --> 02:31.845
How much do I owe you?

02:31.865 --> 02:32.506
$3.60.

02:33.428 --> 02:34.370
Well, let's see.

02:34.530 --> 02:38.337
Here's $3.50, and a dime is $60.

02:38.938 --> 02:40.201
Thanks.

02:40.261 --> 02:44.228
Say, some of the other boys around here are wondering about selling a few ties.

02:44.630 --> 02:48.174
Do you mind if they try to get a contract to cut a few for the railway?

02:48.214 --> 02:51.498
No, no, the railway needs a lot more tires than I can make.

02:51.718 --> 02:53.941
Tell them to see John Williams at Harrisburg.

02:53.961 --> 02:58.426
He's superintendent and chief engineer, Mr. Barrett, president of the company.

02:58.446 --> 03:06.675
But he'll probably tell them to see Williams about... I just dropped in this morning, Williams, to ask you what we're going to do about getting across the presses.

03:06.695 --> 03:10.380
I've been thinking it over, Mr. Barrett, and I believe I have an idea that'll work.

03:10.660 --> 03:11.481
Glad to hear it.

03:11.798 --> 03:16.088
I've been considering the usual bridge, but we've got to leave a passage for steamboats.

03:16.456 --> 03:21.041
and just now we can't afford to spend the money for a bridge high enough so steamboats could go under it.

03:21.461 --> 03:23.023
This is my idea, Mr. Barrett.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.647
Why not build a low-water bridge for all except 50 feet?

03:27.268 --> 03:30.972
Then we could float a 50-foot span on a large, flat boat.

03:30.992 --> 03:38.220
When a steamboat wanted to get by, we could move the floating span downstream and out of the way until the steamboat had passed.

03:38.240 --> 03:43.405
Then we could move our boat, with the rail tracks on it, back into position for our trains to cross on it.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.147
It might possibly work.

03:45.447 --> 03:46.108
Let's see.

03:46.797 --> 03:47.898
Hmm.

03:47.918 --> 03:49.220
I suppose it could be worked out.

03:49.761 --> 03:55.948
The big difficulty would be to get the connecting tracks to join the boat rails and the bridge rails even if the boat isn't exactly in position.

03:56.229 --> 03:56.529
Yes.

03:57.230 --> 04:00.814
I'll have to make a flexible truss to support the connecting rails.

04:00.834 --> 04:06.942
The boat will have to be fairly large to support the weight of a locomotive and a boxcar or two without being pushed too far down in the water.

04:07.402 --> 04:08.163
Yes.

04:08.183 --> 04:10.166
It'll have to be quite a bit larger than a canoe.

04:11.728 --> 04:14.391
Well, we have to get across the river somehow.

04:14.725 --> 04:18.470
I'm anxious to extend the road over to the other side of the brasses as soon as we can.

04:19.111 --> 04:24.237
We'll be able to haul a lot of heavy tonnage from the other side, and we can certainly use the additional money.

04:24.257 --> 04:27.721
I'll get construction started right away if you'll approve the plan.

04:27.741 --> 04:30.505
It's certainly an unusual way to build a railway track.

04:30.525 --> 04:31.846
It's an unusual problem.

04:32.267 --> 04:33.929
Well, you know more about it than I do.

04:34.530 --> 04:35.551
You're the superintendent.

04:36.072 --> 04:40.457
If you think you can do it, go ahead.

04:40.477 --> 04:42.640
THE END

04:50.062 --> 04:51.425
Swing that beam across.

04:51.545 --> 04:52.306
Here it comes.

04:52.326 --> 04:52.687
Hold it.

04:52.907 --> 04:53.649
That's far enough.

04:54.230 --> 04:55.632
Now, get it bolted down.

05:00.021 --> 05:01.844
Punch that caulking well into the seams.

05:02.144 --> 05:04.850
This boat's going to have to float a long time.

05:04.870 --> 05:07.875
If I had this big a boat, I wouldn't stick to railroading.

05:07.895 --> 05:10.500
I'd carry a freight up and down the Brazos River.

05:14.260 --> 05:17.866
Does Williams think this boat will hold up a steam engine and loaded boxcars?

05:17.886 --> 05:19.168
Yeah, he says it will.

05:19.188 --> 05:28.564
Well, it might if the engine was just loaded aboard and lashed down, but when a train hits this thing going four speed ahead, I think it's going to turn upside down and drop the whole caboodle in the river.

05:28.845 --> 05:31.750
Thank goodness I don't have to drive any engines across it.

05:31.770 --> 05:34.935
All I have to do is get it built according to Williams' orders.

05:34.915 --> 05:39.541
We're just about ready to float her out into position as soon as the men get those last braces on her.

05:39.682 --> 05:40.102
All right.

05:40.403 --> 05:43.567
As soon as it's ready, we'll swing it out into the stream and lash it in place.

05:43.807 --> 05:46.651
Then we'll pull the connecting trusses out and anchor the rails.

05:46.671 --> 05:50.576
Won't be long until Stearns can drive his old General Sherman engine across.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.319
That is, if he gets across.

05:57.967 --> 05:59.649
Hey, Mr. Stearns.

05:59.669 --> 05:59.849
Yep.

06:00.590 --> 06:01.952
The super wants you in his office.

06:02.337 --> 06:04.039
What does he want now, Jim?

06:04.199 --> 06:04.900
I don't know.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.183
He just said if I saw you, he'd tell you to come in.

06:07.563 --> 06:08.044
All right.

06:08.664 --> 06:10.667
Wait here for me till I get back, will you?

06:11.968 --> 06:13.830
I wonder what Williams wants now.

06:14.531 --> 06:16.373
Probably checking up on the equipment.

06:17.214 --> 06:21.980
Maybe I can hit him for a new paint job on the Sherman.

06:22.000 --> 06:22.441
Come in.

06:23.682 --> 06:25.464
Morning, Mr. Williams.

06:25.484 --> 06:26.485
Morning, Stearns.

06:26.826 --> 06:27.967
Grab a chair and sit down.

06:28.367 --> 06:28.868
Thanks.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.551
My fireman said you wanted to see me.

06:31.772 --> 06:34.655
Yes, I have a job I want to talk over with you.

06:34.675 --> 06:37.278
You know about our new bridge we're building across the Brazos?

06:37.758 --> 06:39.801
I've heard a lot of talk about it.

06:39.821 --> 06:41.883
What's the opinion of the people doing the talking?

06:42.403 --> 06:49.531
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Williams, most of the people think you're crazy for trying to hold up a railway bridge with a boat.

06:50.172 --> 06:52.174
What do you think about it, Stearns?

06:52.194 --> 06:56.239
Well, I was railroading with you long before we came down to Texas.

06:56.776 --> 07:01.361
I never knew you were doing a foolish thing yet when it came to railroad construction.

07:01.522 --> 07:01.862
Good.

07:02.243 --> 07:06.327
I'm glad you feel that way about it because I've got something to ask of you.

07:06.347 --> 07:09.011
I want you to take the first train across the Brasses.

07:09.391 --> 07:10.132
Test run?

07:10.252 --> 07:10.913
Yes.

07:10.933 --> 07:16.319
I'm sure enough for the bridge that I want to send a complete train across it to Richmond on the first run.

07:16.339 --> 07:18.722
How much of a train will I be pulling?

07:18.742 --> 07:21.566
Two or three boxcars and the passenger car on the back.

07:22.126 --> 07:22.767
I'll do it.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.755
Can I use the old General Sherman engine?

07:25.976 --> 07:27.557
If that's the one you want.

07:27.577 --> 07:28.799
Who'll be the conductor?

07:29.119 --> 07:30.120
Frisco.

07:30.140 --> 07:31.522
He's already said he'd go.

07:31.542 --> 07:32.743
You'll need a fireman, too.

07:32.823 --> 07:33.424
Who can you get?

07:33.784 --> 07:35.105
Jim will fire for me.

07:35.846 --> 07:42.954
All I got to do is see that he's got a plug of tobacco to chew on, and he'd fire for me if I had to run the train underneath the river.

07:45.837 --> 07:49.581
The End

07:59.011 --> 08:04.059
Well, we got the old engine up to the river anyway, Jim.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.744
Now all we have to do is get it across.

08:07.765 --> 08:09.948
How long are we going to wait here, Mr. Stern?

08:10.328 --> 08:12.612
Just long enough to unload the passengers.

08:13.273 --> 08:16.198
The ferry should be all ready to take them across the river.

08:16.959 --> 08:19.242
I'm going back to see Briscoe, the conductor.

08:19.863 --> 08:21.526
That's him talking back there now.

08:21.546 --> 08:23.128
He's talking to Superintendent Williams.

08:23.529 --> 08:24.951
I'll be back in a few minutes.

08:25.842 --> 08:26.803
Hello, Stearns.

08:27.263 --> 08:29.105
How's your General Sherman engines?

08:29.125 --> 08:30.227
Training at the bit.

08:30.487 --> 08:32.529
Waiting to get across the river, Mr. Williams.

08:33.530 --> 08:34.571
Oh, hello, Briscoe.

08:35.152 --> 08:36.793
You getting all your passengers off?

08:36.853 --> 08:38.015
Yes, everybody's off.

08:38.295 --> 08:41.038
I'm afraid he's all ready to take them over to meet them on the other side.

08:41.318 --> 08:43.720
We shouldn't be held up much going into Richmond.

08:44.201 --> 08:46.904
Williams, I think I'll go up and look over the bridge.

08:47.244 --> 08:48.185
You want to come along?

08:48.485 --> 08:49.146
Yes.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.648
I'll be back in a few minutes, Briscoe.

08:51.248 --> 08:52.149
Let's go, Stearns.

08:52.369 --> 08:54.972
I want to see how far the river's gone down anyhow.

08:55.897 --> 08:57.679
Your engine looks in pretty good shape.

08:57.740 --> 09:01.224
I just got through cleaning it, especially for this run.

09:01.244 --> 09:06.532
I don't want those people in Richmond to see me coming into town with a dirty engine the first time.

09:06.552 --> 09:09.996
I guess they'll be glad to see us coming into town most anyway.

09:10.016 --> 09:16.906
Yes, I've heard that the people over there are counting on shipping a lot of tonnage out from that part of the country over our railroad.

09:17.066 --> 09:18.348
I hope so.

09:18.368 --> 09:20.391
Now, here's the start of the bridge.

09:20.411 --> 09:25.077
You see, we have the tires bolted down, and I've had the men put extra spikes on the rails.

09:25.478 --> 09:27.980
It should give you a reasonably good track.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.003
Say, Mr. Williams, look how low that boat is.

09:31.043 --> 09:33.586
The river has gone down farther than I'd thought.

09:34.326 --> 09:36.929
I doubt if you can pull your train up the far side now.

09:37.289 --> 09:40.212
The connecting rails are going up so steeply.

09:40.232 --> 09:42.234
I don't think you can make the engine climb the grade.

09:42.554 --> 09:45.097
She's pretty steep, all right.

09:45.117 --> 09:50.302
Well, I guess we'll have to hit the boat full speed and let the momentum carry us up the other side.

09:50.722 --> 09:51.623
Think you want to try it?

09:52.023 --> 09:52.684
I'll try it.

09:53.187 --> 09:56.913
It won't be the first time I put the Sherman across some tricky track.

09:57.694 --> 09:59.376
We might as well go back and get started.

09:59.837 --> 10:00.258
All right.

10:00.979 --> 10:02.601
I hope you make it on this test run.

10:03.162 --> 10:07.369
The President let me go ahead with this idea, and I'm counting on you to put it over.

10:07.529 --> 10:10.013
The old engine hadn't jumped the track with me yet.

10:10.834 --> 10:12.336
Are you going to ride over with us?

10:12.356 --> 10:14.179
Yes, but I'll leave you here at the engine.

10:14.199 --> 10:16.182
I'm going back to the passenger car at Briscoe.

10:16.202 --> 10:16.643
Good luck.

10:16.983 --> 10:17.524
Thanks.

10:19.208 --> 10:20.871
Well, Jim, how's the fire?

10:21.452 --> 10:25.719
I got enough steam in the boiler to blow us across the river if she lets go.

10:25.759 --> 10:26.360
Good enough.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.963
We may have to do that yet.

10:28.644 --> 10:28.925
Why?

10:28.965 --> 10:29.866
What's the matter?

10:29.886 --> 10:35.736
The boat holding up the track is so low that we nearly need a ladder to get up the other side.

10:35.757 --> 10:36.418
Think we'll make it?

10:36.718 --> 10:42.448
You give me enough steam in the boiler and I'll get the Sherman across the Brazos if I have to jump it over.

10:42.952 --> 10:46.057
If you don't make it, it won't be for want of steam.

10:46.538 --> 10:50.343
I'll keep them pine bolts going in the firebox the fast you can't count them.

10:50.464 --> 10:52.927
Well, start throwing them, because here we go.

10:53.128 --> 10:55.371
Just wait a second until they get me plug in the backy.

10:57.394 --> 10:58.856
All right, let's go.

10:58.876 --> 11:01.180
All right, Briscoe.

11:26.337 --> 11:34.534
Won't be long we hit the bridge now.

11:34.754 --> 11:37.861
It isn't the bridge that's worrying me, it's that consired boat.

11:38.762 --> 11:41.528
All I hope is doesn't tilt over and drop us in the river.

11:47.380 --> 11:48.021
Hang on.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.182
We're going on the bridge.

11:49.302 --> 11:52.446
That floating span seems to be swinging out of position.

11:52.566 --> 11:53.026
Too late.

11:53.127 --> 11:53.867
Stop now.

11:53.907 --> 11:54.488
We're on it.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.009
Look out.

11:55.029 --> 11:56.110
The boat's a-tipping.

11:56.150 --> 11:56.871
Jump, boy.

11:56.891 --> 11:57.191
Jump.

11:57.211 --> 11:58.072
Stay where you are.

11:58.132 --> 12:16.273
We'll make it.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.894
By golly, we made it.

12:28.595 --> 12:31.138
I knew the old General Sherman would get me across.

12:31.479 --> 12:33.502
Hadn't failed me yet.

12:33.522 --> 12:39.149
All we got to do is pick up the passengers now and we'll be heading for Richmond.

12:39.189 --> 12:40.331
What's wrong with you, Jim?

12:40.371 --> 12:41.513
You're white as a sheep.

12:43.055 --> 12:43.836
I don't know.

12:45.738 --> 12:48.522
I guess I must have swallowed my dead bird chewing tobacco.

12:54.526 --> 13:06.143
You have been listening to the BBB&C, a radio dramatization of an episode in the construction of the first railroad in Texas, the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado.

13:06.844 --> 13:12.253
Construction of this railroad began through the efforts of General Sidney Sherman in 1852.

13:12.593 --> 13:19.183
By 1859, the tracks had been built from Harrisburg to a point 50 miles west.

13:19.687 --> 13:24.433
it was extended west another 30 miles to Allerton in the fall of 1860.

13:24.653 --> 13:29.359
The bridge across the Brazos was only moderately successful.

13:30.100 --> 13:43.838
Usually, the train made its way safely across to the opposite side, but sometimes it derailed and ended up in the river, so passengers were offered the choice of going across the river either by train or by ferry.

13:44.459 --> 13:56.155
After several mergers, the BBB&C became a part of one of the state's main trunk line railways, with, as you may imagine, a less hazardous bridge crossing the Brazos.

13:56.977 --> 14:02.645
Thousands of railway ties produced in Texas were used to build this railroad.

14:03.145 --> 14:07.952
Millions of other ties were used in developing the state's extensive railway system.

14:08.388 --> 14:23.245
Today, Texas produces more than three and three-quarter million railway ties each year from its East Texas forests, employing many people and bringing more than $5 million in income to the state.

14:23.265 --> 14:29.032
Hundreds of farmers and timberland owners grow timber for ties as a money crop.

14:29.052 --> 14:36.420
Ten Texas wood-preserving plants treat ties scientifically with coal-tar creosote to prolong their usefulness.

14:36.974 --> 14:39.397
an $8 million business in the state.

14:40.157 --> 14:44.702
A constant supply of timber will build a greater Texas.

14:54.332 --> 15:04.483
