00:04.688 --> 00:08.083
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:09.953 --> 00:11.515
Hello there, folks.

00:11.535 --> 00:15.079
This is Smokey, the forest fire preventin' bear.

00:15.559 --> 00:21.045
Those singin' friends of mine, the sons of the pioneers, have a song for you.

00:21.065 --> 00:26.291
But first, how about joinin' us on a little visit to a big star?

00:26.832 --> 00:31.057
Today it's that popular actor and photographer, Robert Cummings.

00:31.697 --> 00:36.042
Say, Mr. Cummings, I mean Mr. Collins, I don't get it.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.425
I just don't get it.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.769
Why do you want to take my picture?

00:40.789 --> 00:41.910
Don't you see, Smokey?

00:42.471 --> 00:45.175
Everyone believes that all I care about is beautiful women.

00:45.716 --> 00:49.021
And all I'm interested in is taking pictures of beautiful women.

00:49.041 --> 00:51.284
Well, you stand for another kind of beauty.

00:51.304 --> 00:52.346
And I'm really keen about it.

00:52.947 --> 00:54.809
The beauty of the outdoors.

00:54.829 --> 00:59.977
The beauty you find in the trees of the forest, in the mountains at sunrise, and across the prairie at sunset.

01:00.698 --> 01:03.362
In the rushing streams and along the edge of a quiet lake.

01:04.023 --> 01:05.665
This is real beauty, too.

01:05.686 --> 01:06.707
The beauty of America.

01:07.075 --> 01:11.426
and we must protect it against destruction or disfigurement by wildfire.

01:11.446 --> 01:21.912
And Smokey, if our session today makes even one person more careful with his matches or smokes, or keeps just one forest fire from starting, then this will have been very, very worthwhile.

01:22.330 --> 01:23.412
Thanks, Mr. Cummings.

01:23.673 --> 01:24.715
Now, don't go away.

01:25.176 --> 01:29.144
The Sons of the Pioneers have planned something special for you.

01:29.405 --> 01:30.447
How about it, Lloyd?

01:30.968 --> 01:40.508
Smokey, we have a song that ties right in with what Mr. Cummings said about the beauty of the prairie at sunset and beautiful women and... Well, listen...

01:49.145 --> 02:18.932
The prairie rests at even tide and small things into shadows hide for heaven walks the flames tonight. A million stars that knew they should came shining down for there you stood. A vision bathed in heaven

02:19.655 --> 02:39.891
Night falls on the prairie, pale shadows appear.

02:49.422 --> 03:18.838
That you must be Part of the prairie too I've made you from moonbeams When you were done, you were one

03:19.190 --> 03:44.893
Of its charms Night falls on the prairie And I found an angel in my arms

03:53.969 --> 03:56.672
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:56.692 --> 03:59.216
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:59.236 --> 04:04.742
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:04.803 --> 04:10.990
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:11.010 --> 04:22.845
So until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to

04:22.825 --> 04:29.754
always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:29.774 --> 04:38.586
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:39.167 --> 04:43.272
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:43.673 --> 04:48.039
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:48.039 --> 05:03.765
[Music.]
