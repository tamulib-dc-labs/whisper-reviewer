00:03.440 --> 00:08.845
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:08.865 --> 00:10.167
Hello there, folks.

00:10.467 --> 00:14.111
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:14.591 --> 00:19.816
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:19.836 --> 00:24.501
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:24.921 --> 00:29.506
And today is an old friend of mine, and I guess a friend of just about everyone.

00:29.966 --> 00:31.708
It's Tennessee Ernie Ford.

00:32.127 --> 00:35.271
Thanks, Ernie, for taking time out to let us come and visit.

00:35.872 --> 00:57.822
Well, smoky old buddy, if anyone was to have told me years ago that, well, when I was just a little feller, barefooted and roaming the Tennessee hills and woods, that one day I'd be discussing a serious problem with a bear, all decked out in dungarees, a ranger hat and a shovel, well, I'd have told that feller to hightail it out of there before I warmed the seat of his breeches.

00:59.264 --> 01:01.948
Well, it just shows how time rolls along, doesn't it?

01:02.570 --> 01:04.732
In some ways, that is.

01:04.752 --> 01:08.135
In others, time is just standing still, seems like.

01:09.476 --> 01:15.562
Well, when I was a kid, some folks thought nothing about setting a fire out in the woods for one reason or another.

01:15.582 --> 01:25.011
To green up the grass, maybe, or to get rid of some boll weevils, to chase out the snakes, or to smoke out a squirrel, or just to see the woods burn.

01:25.471 --> 01:26.012
Think of that.

01:27.653 --> 01:31.817
And from what I hear, Smokey, there's still a lot of that foolishness going on.

01:32.894 --> 01:34.236
Well, it is foolishness.

01:34.316 --> 01:36.278
It's shameful and it's sinful.

01:38.180 --> 01:42.906
Seems to me in this day and time we ought to be taking better care of what the good Lord has given us.

01:43.807 --> 01:50.114
We sure need all the trees that can grow and good soil to protect our water supply, places for wildlife to live.

01:51.736 --> 01:58.303
We lose something mighty precious every time fire runs wild through the woods.

01:58.323 --> 01:59.765
Well, I've said my piece, Smokey.

02:00.606 --> 02:02.428
I see you have the sons of the pioneers with you.

02:03.235 --> 02:06.438
How about one of their fine Western spirituals?

02:06.458 --> 02:07.499
Sure thing, Ernie.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.961
We'll do Saddle Up.

02:08.981 --> 02:13.125
It tells a bit about the dawning of Judgment Day, and we hope you like it.

02:13.145 --> 02:16.729
Saddle up!

02:16.749 --> 02:30.323
Gabriel's trumpet blast the morn Saddle up, you men to the leather born Your graves will yield their sleep and pray This is the dawning of the Judgment Day

02:32.564 --> 02:58.167
The list is long, you'll hear the names Billy the Kid, and old as a James Johnny, Ringo, Curly Bill They're all asleep on a sumble hill Saddle up, saddle up, saddle up Rise up, your faithful ponies wake Saddle up and ride through the golden gate

02:58.282 --> 03:08.327
The judge will call you one by one And nary a man is gonna tow the gun Saddle up!

03:08.347 --> 03:08.548
Saddle up!

03:08.568 --> 03:08.768
Saddle up!

03:08.788 --> 03:09.009
Saddle up!

03:09.029 --> 03:12.578
He's calling those he knows should ride

03:12.845 --> 03:30.077
Just as they lived and just as they died Some are doomed by the judge's word To the ghostly riders and the devil's herd Saddle up, saddle up, saddle up, saddle up The list is long and you all know

03:30.260 --> 03:33.866
Wild Bill Hickok and old Geronimo.

03:33.886 --> 03:40.817
Sitting Bull and old Sam Bass, who now through judgments, portals pass.

03:40.837 --> 03:44.142
So hear that trumpet, lose your fears.

03:44.903 --> 03:51.453
Although you've slept for these 80 years, you've never really ever died.

03:51.473 --> 03:53.196
So saddle, saddle.

04:03.115 --> 04:04.997
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:05.277 --> 04:07.780
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:08.060 --> 04:13.266
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:13.326 --> 04:19.072
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:19.652 --> 04:32.886
Until we say hello there again, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:33.237 --> 04:42.136
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowling and a-growling and a-sniffing the air.

04:42.737 --> 04:46.866
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:47.227 --> 04:51.837
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.
