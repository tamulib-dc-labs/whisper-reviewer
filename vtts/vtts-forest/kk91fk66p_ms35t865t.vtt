WEBVTT

00:24.635 --> 00:27.098
This is your old range rider, wood rider.

00:27.678 --> 00:29.240
Jelly Elliott and the three knot heads.

00:30.321 --> 00:35.327
Yes sir, we're just sitting here under the old pine tree and we'd like to come in and visit with you a while.

00:35.367 --> 00:38.831
We got a lot of tunes we want to play and sing for you.

00:39.392 --> 00:40.653
Some of them you might like.

00:41.073 --> 00:46.259
So just come on down the trail here under the old pine tree and set a spell with us.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.702
We're going to be with you for 14 and a half minutes.

00:50.538 --> 00:52.001
Well, all right, sir.

00:52.021 --> 00:53.002
Yes, sir.

00:53.503 --> 00:54.545
Well, here it is, friends.

00:54.585 --> 00:58.813
The next 14 and a half minutes, we'll be with you, brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from you.

00:59.514 --> 01:02.419
State Forestry Service and Uncle Sam's Forestry Service.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.862
And don't forget that.

01:03.882 --> 01:06.166
Oh, boy, we got a lot of tunes here.

01:06.186 --> 01:09.913
Oh, these boys are just foaming at the mouth, chewing a bit, ready to go here.

01:09.893 --> 01:14.577
And I don't know of anything any better to do than get Robert to come on up here and start.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.759
No, I believe Slim's going to sing.

01:16.779 --> 01:17.880
But who takes this thing off?

01:17.900 --> 01:18.621
Robert takes it off.

01:18.641 --> 01:19.822
He sure does with his fiddle.

01:20.062 --> 01:20.923
Slim's going to sing.

01:21.363 --> 01:22.885
This tune don't fit us, old friend.

01:22.965 --> 01:25.767
I'm telling you for sure, because we all feel fine, don't we, boys?

01:25.787 --> 01:26.128
Yes, sir.

01:26.188 --> 01:26.948
We're feeling good.

01:26.968 --> 01:28.710
But here's Slim to sing, Feeling Bad.

01:32.734 --> 01:36.457
I'm feeling bad, alone and sad.

01:37.037 --> 01:39.900
Cause I've lost the only love I ever had.

01:39.880 --> 02:04.993
Well, I don't know where to go Since she said she didn't love me anymore No need to worry, I'll be on my way I'll find a new love some other day Goodbye, blues, I paid my due Hand me down my old guitar in walking shoes

02:17.360 --> 02:44.734
I'm feeling bad, alone and sad, cause I've lost the only love I ever

02:48.730 --> 03:09.878
to go since she said she didn't want me anymore no need to worry i'll be on my way i'll find a new love some other day goodbye blue i paid my dues hand me down my old guitar and walking shoes

03:11.866 --> 03:13.628
Well, thank you, Slim.

03:13.648 --> 03:14.389
Goodbye, blues.

03:14.409 --> 03:15.110
That's it.

03:15.130 --> 03:18.575
That's what we like to hear everybody say, goodbye, blues.

03:18.755 --> 03:25.164
You know, friends, I just wanted to tell you here a dab, dab, and have two dabs about what fire does to the woods.

03:25.184 --> 03:27.587
Did you ever stop to think what fire does to the woods?

03:28.889 --> 03:30.551
The woods catch a fire and burn over.

03:30.591 --> 03:32.193
I'm telling you, that's plumb pity.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.936
So that beats anything I've ever seen.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.698
It just cuts down on the jobs.

03:36.319 --> 03:39.043
You just don't have no idea what all it does cut down.

03:39.944 --> 03:41.586
Just start out with the woods cutters.

03:41.819 --> 03:43.221
The flathead.

03:43.241 --> 03:45.123
A lot of people call them flatheads.

03:45.143 --> 03:46.265
Log sawers.

03:46.285 --> 03:47.826
Saw loggers.

03:47.846 --> 03:49.428
You know, the people that saw the logs.

03:49.448 --> 03:50.470
They haven't got any jobs.

03:50.510 --> 03:53.033
When the timber's all burned up, they don't have any jobs.

03:53.053 --> 03:54.194
They can't saw no logs.

03:54.915 --> 03:59.281
The log hauler with the truck, he can't haul no logs because there ain't no logs to haul.

03:59.721 --> 04:00.963
He don't buy any gasoline.

04:01.684 --> 04:02.445
That cuts him out.

04:02.465 --> 04:03.286
He don't have any money.

04:03.666 --> 04:04.868
He can't buy gasoline.

04:04.928 --> 04:05.969
He don't need any gasoline.

04:05.989 --> 04:06.930
There's no logs to haul.

04:06.950 --> 04:08.732
So the filling station man, he goes broke.

04:08.752 --> 04:10.054
Goes in the hands of the receiver.

04:10.473 --> 04:17.711
Then he can't buy gas from the distributor, and that cuts off all the men at the refinery where they make the gas.

04:18.393 --> 04:22.643
And then, of course, none of them buy clothes to wear.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.409
That puts the merchant out of business, the dry goods merchant.

04:26.429 --> 04:28.953
He can't sell no overalls and shirts and gloves and things.

04:29.334 --> 04:30.175
So he don't need them.

04:30.195 --> 04:32.058
He don't buy them from the manufacturer.

04:32.399 --> 04:37.286
The manufacturer can't sell them when he's got them because the woods is burned off and nobody can buy them.

04:37.306 --> 04:39.750
So the textile mills, they have to shut down.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.533
That puts all them out of a job.

04:41.553 --> 04:43.616
And then it starts back down south.

04:43.677 --> 04:45.179
Then it comes on back down south.

04:45.860 --> 04:49.626
After the textile mills can't buy the material to make the...

04:49.825 --> 04:52.828
the textile, the cloth, and all, well, they don't need no cotton.

04:52.949 --> 04:55.351
So, therefore, they pull a farmer down south there.

04:55.752 --> 04:56.953
No use of him raising cotton.

04:56.973 --> 04:57.634
He can't sell it.

04:58.194 --> 05:05.943
And I'm telling you, I could stand here and talk to you 30 minutes, friends, about who all is involved just on account of woods burning over.

05:05.963 --> 05:07.845
It just beats anything you've ever seen.

05:07.865 --> 05:12.070
And there ain't but one way for us to stop that, and that's just don't let the fire start.

05:12.252 --> 05:13.474
We got to do something about it.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.037
We need all this paper.

05:15.057 --> 05:15.818
Need it.

05:15.838 --> 05:19.304
Need it to produce for newsprint and all everything.

05:19.324 --> 05:21.267
And we just got to have it.

05:21.287 --> 05:22.369
Let's play another tune here.

05:22.449 --> 05:23.351
Was I going to sing?

05:23.371 --> 05:24.272
Yeah, I'm going to sing.

05:24.913 --> 05:27.618
These, all these fellas, now they're bound to have families.

05:27.638 --> 05:37.855
They got families and they can't make a living for their families if there's no logs to saw and no logs to haul and no gas being bought and no clothes being bought and no

05:38.273 --> 05:40.655
Cotton being picked and all that, it's bad.

05:40.695 --> 05:42.297
How they gonna make a living to their family.

05:42.337 --> 05:46.401
Here's the next tune played especially for all you fellas out there raising the family.

05:46.421 --> 05:47.843
Especially if you got a little boy.

05:47.863 --> 05:49.965
It's the old Al Jolson song, Sonny Boy.

05:57.452 --> 06:08.263
Chubby hands and big brown eyes Makes our home a paradise He's our darling, precious little boy

06:08.851 --> 06:23.552
Sonny boy, tottering feet that tried to hold, precious lips that tried to hold, he's our darling, precious little boy.

06:24.123 --> 06:52.695
sunny boy he's our little ray of sunshine from heaven above we could hardly live without him our baby we love though his little head is bald still we love him best of all he's our darling

06:53.063 --> 06:57.775
Precious little sunny boy.

08:03.044 --> 08:31.228
Chubby hands and big brown eyes Makes our home a paradise He's our darling precious little sunny boy Tiny feet that try to roll Precious lips that try to go He's our darling precious little boy

08:31.580 --> 08:59.730
Sunny boy He's our little ray of sunshine From heaven above We could hardly live without him Our baby we love Though his little head is bald Still we love him best of all

09:00.250 --> 09:09.603
He's our darling, precious little, sunny boy.

09:09.623 --> 09:10.224
Thank you, boys.

09:10.284 --> 09:10.665
Thank you.

09:10.685 --> 09:14.090
I hope all you mothers and fathers out there listening enjoyed that tune.

09:15.191 --> 09:16.834
Really enjoyed singing it for you.

09:17.354 --> 09:24.685
Friends, every day on an average of 575 fires, scorch our woods and forests here in the United States.

09:24.765 --> 09:25.526
Ain't that awful?

09:25.626 --> 09:26.227
575 fires.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.350
Every day.

09:28.786 --> 09:35.734
Now, that makes an average of about 200,000 a year burning over 30 million acres.

09:35.754 --> 09:36.395
Just think of that.

09:36.495 --> 09:42.382
30 million acres every year of good timberland burning up, all the young trees burning up.

09:42.402 --> 09:43.082
Just think of it.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.505
Now, these fires destroy small trees.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.606
That's tomorrow's timber.

09:47.247 --> 09:48.589
And they destroy them by the billions.

09:48.909 --> 09:54.515
The salt timber that goes up in flames is enough to build 86,000 five-room homes.

09:54.535 --> 09:54.996
Think of that.

09:55.448 --> 10:01.256
The salt timber that's burned up every year would build 86,000 five-room houses.

10:01.637 --> 10:03.980
That's what Uncle Sam says, and he knows.

10:04.681 --> 10:08.606
Now, these forests and wood fires, they destroy enough pup-sized trees.

10:08.626 --> 10:09.568
That's pupwood timber.

10:09.968 --> 10:18.440
They destroy enough each year to produce all the newsprint needed to supply every newspaper in the United States for 12 months.

10:18.460 --> 10:18.961
That's a year.

10:19.441 --> 10:24.949
In other words, we destroy a year's supply of newsprint every year, just carelessness and

10:25.334 --> 10:26.435
Woods forest and all that.

10:27.136 --> 10:30.461
Now, these forests and woods forest, friends, that's bad business.

10:30.641 --> 10:32.243
That's bad business.

10:32.263 --> 10:33.705
And they can cause floods.

10:33.725 --> 10:35.027
They can hurt the grazing.

10:35.047 --> 10:36.469
It kills out the wildlife.

10:36.729 --> 10:39.333
It destroys all the beauty of the woods.

10:39.353 --> 10:43.839
And you know how pretty it is in the woods when they put in green and all the shrubber and things.

10:44.179 --> 10:44.940
That's nice.

10:45.441 --> 10:49.166
And carelessness and letting the woods burn over destroys all that.

10:50.207 --> 10:53.892
And I'm telling you, it hits in the heart and it hits in the pocketbook.

10:54.032 --> 10:54.733
And that's what hurts.

10:55.270 --> 10:57.536
Now, brother, I mean, we got to do something about it.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.381
So let's be careful of them forest fires.

10:59.522 --> 11:01.066
Here's the time for another tune here.

11:01.527 --> 11:02.049
What are we going to do?

11:02.069 --> 11:05.819
We're going to do just a dab, dab, and a half, two dabs of somebody's rose here, and Robert's going to sing it.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.002
Here we go.

11:10.745 --> 11:38.423
You're somebody's rose now, and everyone knows now That you have decided just who it will be I'm walking in clover, my troubles are over You're somebody's rose now, that someone is me I've waited a long time for someone like you

11:39.128 --> 11:44.877
And now there's a lifetime too good to be true.

11:44.897 --> 11:50.005
The vows to be spoken will never be broken.

11:50.306 --> 11:55.273
You're somebody's rose now that someone is me.

11:57.817 --> 11:58.499
Thank you, Robert.

11:58.519 --> 11:58.899
Thank you.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.021
Somebody's rose there.

12:00.041 --> 12:01.563
That's a mighty pretty tune, Robert.

12:01.583 --> 12:02.885
You ought to do that more often.

12:03.366 --> 12:04.528
I bet a lot of people...

12:05.234 --> 12:12.345
like that, and I bet you we get some cards and letters right here on this station requesting that tune again.

12:13.186 --> 12:14.428
Friend, that's an important thing.

12:14.448 --> 12:15.390
We like to hear from you.

12:15.430 --> 12:22.862
Now, we up here just beating our brains out, if we had any to beat out, sitting here under the old pine tree trying to abuse you.

12:23.042 --> 12:26.607
I mean, amuse you, excuse me, amuse you, yeah, and play for you.

12:26.888 --> 12:29.272
I don't know why I ever tried to use that word anyhow.

12:29.352 --> 12:30.614
I ought to have had better sense than that.

12:31.295 --> 12:32.136
Anyway, we're

12:32.470 --> 12:35.958
We're just getting our enjoys out of it, and we hope that you are.

12:36.178 --> 12:39.706
And we want you to come down the trail with us every time we're here.

12:39.726 --> 12:48.486
And if you'll listen to the announcer when we go off there, he'll let you know what day we'll be back, and we'll be mighty glad to have you come down the trail with us.

12:48.506 --> 12:51.593
And we'll do our best to play the tunes that you like to hear and want to hear.

12:52.079 --> 12:54.322
And friends, don't forget to watch them forest fires.

12:54.342 --> 12:59.811
Now, you may be driving down the highway there in your car, and you'll see a pretty stretch of woods.

12:59.831 --> 13:05.499
And I'll guarantee you there's not a man or woman, child or whatnot that don't say, ain't them woods pretty?

13:05.519 --> 13:06.501
Them's the prettiest woods.

13:06.521 --> 13:09.044
I'd just like to get out there and stroll around out in them woods.

13:09.705 --> 13:10.567
Yeah, who wouldn't?

13:10.667 --> 13:11.488
Everybody would.

13:11.924 --> 13:25.296
But now, you drive down the road and you see a bunch of old ugly woods that's all burnt over and the shrubbers all burnt out and nothing but old scorched limbs and old black stumps and the timbers all scrubby and knotty and everything.

13:25.316 --> 13:28.038
Now, who wants to get out there and wander around in that?

13:28.058 --> 13:28.799
Nobody.

13:28.819 --> 13:31.861
Why, you couldn't even get a polecat to get out there and wander around in that.

13:31.901 --> 13:36.585
The varmints, even the varmints got sense enough to stay out of the burnt over woods.

13:37.166 --> 13:40.109
And, of course, a lot of people ain't got that much sense, I don't believe.

13:40.409 --> 13:41.830
They set them on fire.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.031
They ought not do that.

13:43.071 --> 13:44.453
Let's watch them forest fires.

13:44.493 --> 13:45.674
Friends, we're going to have to go.

13:45.715 --> 13:54.385
We've run out of time, and we're going to have to go today, but be sure and listen to the announcer for our future program, and also write us a penny postcard or letter.

13:54.425 --> 13:57.269
Now, before we go, I'd like to leave a thought for the day with you.

13:57.289 --> 14:02.856
The best way to stop woods fires is to not let them start in the first place.

14:07.072 --> 14:09.798
Friends, that takes up all the time I've got left today.

14:09.818 --> 14:20.762
I'd like to remind you again, for the last 14 and a half minutes, Jolly Elliot and the Three Knot Heads have been brought to you with best wishes and compliments from your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's forestry service.

14:21.002 --> 14:25.131
Friends, remember, only you can prevent woods fires.
