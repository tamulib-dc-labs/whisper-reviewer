00:00.000 --> 00:19.572
[Music.]

00:19.572 --> 00:21.275
Well, howdy, friends.

00:21.295 --> 00:21.736
How y'all?

00:23.820 --> 00:26.965
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads.

00:26.985 --> 00:30.993
We're going to be sitting with you a spell, about 14 and a half minutes to be exact.

00:31.493 --> 00:35.020
We're down here on the creek bank under a dread big old pine tree.

00:35.761 --> 00:40.470
And we'd like for you to come on down the trail and just join in there and have a lot of fun.

00:40.510 --> 00:42.373
Pull up a chair and make yourself at home.

00:47.247 --> 00:48.228
Yes, sir.

00:48.248 --> 00:57.260
Well, here we go again, friends, for another spasm brought to you by the Forestry Service and State Forestry Service, that is, and Uncle Sam's Forestry Service.

00:57.881 --> 01:03.248
Yeah, and we're going to do our best to play some of these tunes that we've been getting most requests for.

01:03.268 --> 01:04.349
Here we go with the first tune.

01:04.409 --> 01:05.811
It's a fast one.

01:05.831 --> 01:11.719
Yeah, it's a tune that we get a lot of requests for, and Robert's going to play it on his fiddle, and it's called Silver Bells.

01:11.719 --> 02:31.687
[Music.]

02:31.687 --> 02:33.969
Well, all right there.

02:33.989 --> 02:34.650
Thank you, Robert.

02:34.670 --> 02:35.090
Thank you.

02:35.571 --> 02:40.015
And that was Miss Anderson, little boy Deacon there, doing the chiming in there about the bridge somewhere.

02:40.335 --> 02:50.685
Friends, you know, I went back home the other day, went back to the old home place over there, up in the hills, up there in the hills where I was raised.

02:50.705 --> 02:59.753
I used to run around over there barefooted, and boy, I'm telling you, my feet was so tough, and I'd go down through the thickets there, and them briars would see my feet coming, and they'd lay down.

03:00.391 --> 03:00.992
That's the truth.

03:01.292 --> 03:03.896
Went back over there for a big family reunion.

03:03.916 --> 03:04.958
You know what that is.

03:05.258 --> 03:06.320
Just have a lot of fun.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.925
Went back over there, and I never was as surprised in my life.

03:10.706 --> 03:13.290
That's the truth, friends, when I got back over at the old home place.

03:14.171 --> 03:20.780
Well, back over there on the backside of the field, backside of the place there, we used to have a corn field over there on the backside.

03:21.341 --> 03:29.453
And I used to tote water over there to Daddy when he was plowing over there and meet him at the end of the turn row with a good, cool drink, you know, drink of water and...

03:29.804 --> 03:31.846
And I walked around back over there.

03:32.287 --> 03:33.348
And you know that field?

03:33.709 --> 03:34.690
It ain't a field no more.

03:35.090 --> 03:35.711
No.

03:35.731 --> 03:37.653
It was a field 20 years ago.

03:37.673 --> 03:43.621
Never will forget Daddy used to have to put fertile dink on that old poor ground out there to try to raise a few nubbins.

03:44.402 --> 03:45.923
But it ain't a field no more, friends.

03:46.404 --> 03:54.934
It's one of the finest crops of timber growing on that old wore out, washed away, used to be corn patch that you ever see.

03:54.954 --> 03:57.297
Friends, I never saw timber grow so fast as it

03:57.648 --> 04:00.732
as it's grown on that old poor hill land there.

04:01.333 --> 04:08.222
And the man that's there now told me they just got through cutting it over, thinning it out for pupwood.

04:08.242 --> 04:13.529
He said they cut about 10 cords of pupwood per acre on that 25 acres.

04:14.230 --> 04:18.616
And they've still got two-thirds of the trees left to grow more pupwood.

04:19.036 --> 04:22.080
And they'll grow faster and better now that it's thinned out.

04:22.781 --> 04:24.043
Now, that makes sense, don't it?

04:24.462 --> 04:29.669
And it didn't nobody have to apply it, and it didn't nobody have to tote a cool drink of water down there either.

04:30.350 --> 04:33.694
That's the kind of crop I like to raise where I don't have to fool with it.

04:34.395 --> 04:38.641
And my brother said that all it did was just throw the old field out.

04:38.661 --> 04:42.526
They just turned it out, and it just naturally seeded itself in.

04:42.546 --> 04:45.811
Now, and there hadn't been any fires in it at all.

04:45.971 --> 04:47.413
That's the main thing.

04:48.234 --> 04:52.079
And another thing, they're going to thin it again in about five years.

04:52.099 --> 04:53.541
He said that that

04:53.774 --> 05:10.919
forestry, local forestry man there told him that you can, he helped him there and showed him what trees to cut and sort of assisted him in thinning 
it out and cut it again in five years and probably get a third more or maybe twice as much this next time as he did this time.

05:11.540 --> 05:18.050
Boy, it sure makes me proud of the folks that's still back there on the old home place because it was too wore out and run down to raise anything else.

05:18.110 --> 05:21.154
It's too poor to raise a fuss on, but it sure raised some good timber.

05:21.795 --> 05:22.937
And I'm telling you, I just,

05:23.356 --> 05:26.280
Got a big kick out of walking around out there in them pine needles.

05:26.700 --> 05:31.786
I even pulled off my shoes and got barefooted, but I couldn't take very much of that.

05:31.806 --> 05:32.688
I had to put them back on.

05:32.968 --> 05:34.350
Clem, you want to sing a song, buddy?

05:34.790 --> 05:35.070
Yeah.

05:35.711 --> 05:36.392
Oh, yeah, that's right.

05:36.412 --> 05:37.233
We're going to play a waltz.

05:37.934 --> 05:41.659
Robert, gather yourself up, son, and get on up here with that cornstalk fiddle of yours.

05:41.679 --> 05:42.780
We're going to play a waltz, friend.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.881
This is an old-timer.

05:43.941 --> 05:50.950
I don't know where this thing originated, but it's a mighty pretty old tune, and it's called West Ophelia Waltz.

05:50.950 --> 07:07.255
[Music.]

07:07.255 --> 07:08.277
Well, thank you, Robert.

07:08.317 --> 07:08.637
Thank you.

07:08.657 --> 07:09.419
There it is, friend.

07:09.839 --> 07:11.622
I know a lot of you old-timers out there.

07:12.003 --> 07:13.305
Probably enjoyed that tune.

07:13.325 --> 07:16.230
I can just see them waltzing around.

07:16.250 --> 07:21.238
I remember when I was a little old boy back home there on that old, woe-out hill farm there.

07:21.258 --> 07:31.575
Mama used to get the old fiddle down and play them old waltzes, and some of her brothers and sisters would come in with their husbands and wives, and some of the neighbors would come in and they'd...

07:31.960 --> 07:38.769
She'd play one of them old waltzes like that, and everybody would waltz, some old-fashioned waltzes, and I'm telling you, friends, it's just something to see.

07:39.530 --> 07:44.556
And I think about it real often, too, especially when I go back to the old home place.

07:44.576 --> 07:49.282
Friends, I told you here a day or two ago about these free books we had for you.

07:49.722 --> 07:51.324
Free books, that's a little book.

07:52.326 --> 07:56.531
We really want you to have this little book, and you're a state forestry man now.

07:56.551 --> 08:01.377
He wants you to have it, and Uncle Sam wants you to have it, and I know that you'll want this little book.

08:02.032 --> 08:03.374
It's really interesting.

08:04.155 --> 08:05.958

08:06.840 --> 08:08.262

08:08.663 --> 08:15.995
But in this book, it's got a lot of quotations in there out of the Bible, along with some beautiful pictures and things.

08:16.015 --> 08:24.228
And it just shows you how the Bible ties in with the woods and the forests and fires, forest fires and all that sort of stuff.

08:24.248 --> 08:26.031
Just how it comes right in there.

08:26.132 --> 08:27.173
You may not think that.

08:27.213 --> 08:27.634
You may...

08:27.952 --> 08:47.732
Uh maybe you've never stopped to think of it but that's right it the Bible and these forest fires woods fires and all ties right in, hand in hand. And

09:39.494 --> 09:41.056
Well, let's play another tune here.

09:41.076 --> 09:42.417
Yes, sir, we're going to play another tune.

09:42.437 --> 09:46.983
Slim's going to gather himself up here and just waddle up to the microphone here.

09:47.484 --> 09:53.832
Slim sings all the sad songs on the program, and here he is with a little ditty called Blues in My Heart.

10:02.182 --> 10:30.113
Blues in my heart. Oh, how it ain't Nobody knows the sorrow it takes. I should have known right from the start, you'd leave me with

10:36.303 --> 10:39.089
Blues in my heart.

10:40.852 --> 10:45.662
Blues in my heart.

10:45.682 --> 10:49.209
Blue over you.

10:50.772 --> 10:53.417
Never believe.

10:55.507 --> 11:19.590
You'd be so untrue. I never dreamed that we'd ever part. I've got these lonesome blues in my heart.

11:28.177 --> 11:39.973
...I couldn't hold. I feel like a lamb left straight from the fold.

11:39.993 --> 11:41.655
What can I do?

11:44.839 --> 11:46.742
Oh, what can I say?

11:50.013 --> 11:59.988
Blues in my heart has got me this way.

12:00.008 --> 12:03.253
Rain falling down,

12:04.855 --> 12:09.061
down from the sky,

12:10.383 --> 12:13.067
even the sun beginning to cry.

12:19.915 --> 12:46.029
Everything's wrong since we're apart. I wish I could lose these blues in my heart. Now, friends, while we're going, I was telling you about going back to the old home place.

12:46.049 --> 12:47.070
That wasn't no tale.

12:47.557 --> 12:53.168
I just told you about going back out there and seeing that patch of timber on the old home place, and that's fact.

12:53.188 --> 12:54.891
Now, that's happening in other places, too.

12:55.232 --> 13:00.241
Friends, people is waking up to the fact, and they're getting smarter and smarter or something.

13:00.783 --> 13:03.207
Some places, it'll seed itself back naturally.

13:03.247 --> 13:04.630
You don't have to do nothing about it.

13:04.650 --> 13:05.371
It just turned out.

13:05.391 --> 13:06.874
But others have to be planted.

13:06.894 --> 13:07.776
They've got to be planted.

13:08.127 --> 13:10.870
But you've got to keep them forest fires out of there.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.252
It don't amount to a hill of beans.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.433
It's just like corn.

13:13.513 --> 13:15.115
You can't plant corn and then burn it up.

13:15.215 --> 13:16.576
It won't do no good.

13:16.636 --> 13:17.557
Same thing with timber.

13:18.158 --> 13:20.420
You just can't do it.

13:20.440 --> 13:20.901
That's all.

13:20.921 --> 13:22.463
It just won't grow if you're going to burn it off.

13:22.483 --> 13:23.824
So keep the forest fires out of there.

13:23.884 --> 13:27.708
Now, you can see local forest boards, and they'll give you all the assistance you need.

13:27.728 --> 13:31.553
So see them and get in touch with them, and they'll let you know all about this planting of these trees.

13:31.573 --> 13:32.353
We've got to go, friends.

13:32.373 --> 13:37.459
We've run out of time here for the day, but the announcer, he'll let you know what day we'll be back.

13:37.709 --> 13:41.514
Now, before we go, I'd like to let you know, friends, a thought here for the day.

13:41.534 --> 13:50.906
Nine out of every ten woods fires are caused by man, the result of carelessness, thoughtlessness, or just plain cussedness.

13:50.926 --> 13:58.375
Friends, we've really enjoyed being with you today for this 14 and a half minutes here on this big old pine tree, and we'd like to have you come down our trail again.

13:59.817 --> 14:04.763
And remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

14:04.763 --> 14:33.773
[Music.]
