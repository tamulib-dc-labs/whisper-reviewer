Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear Hello there, folks.

00:08.588 --> 00:11.693
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:12.254 --> 00:17.081
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:17.522 --> 00:22.109
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:22.450 --> 00:24.914
Today, it's Miss Barbara Stanwyck.

00:25.835 --> 00:29.481
God moves in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform.

00:30.001 --> 00:35.148
These words are given rich new meaning by the story of a little boy and a bear named Smokey.

00:35.909 --> 00:48.385
The story was told by an assistant state forest ranger in a recent newsletter of the California Division of Forestry who wrote, While handling the forestry booth at the fair, I had a most unusual experience.

00:49.066 --> 00:50.948
It was 10 o'clock at night.

00:50.968 --> 00:59.299
I had just disconnected the mechanical Smokey bear and put out the lights of our exhibit when a young mother and three little boys appeared outside the railing.

01:00.005 --> 01:05.312
Two of the boys were jumping up and down in glee, as most children do when they see Smokey.

01:05.332 --> 01:15.586
The third little fellow clung to his mother's skirts, face turned away as she tried to console him by saying, It looks as if they are putting Smokey away for the night, honey.

01:15.606 --> 01:17.067
We will have to come back tomorrow.

01:17.848 --> 01:23.115
Not wanting to disappoint any child, I turned the lights back on and started Smokey's voice again.

01:23.936 --> 01:26.620
It was then I saw the little fellow was blind.

01:27.038 --> 01:30.861
I brought him inside and let him see Smokey with his hands.

01:31.522 --> 01:35.025
He jumped up and down as happy as any normally sighted child.

01:35.786 --> 01:41.871
In talking to his mother, I learned there was no place where they lived for a sightless child to go to school.

01:42.691 --> 01:46.395
I contacted the County Office of Education.

01:46.415 --> 01:56.083
They found that there were enough children in the county to make up special classes, and now there is a combined school for the blind and the deaf children in that county.

01:56.941 --> 02:00.305
You never know what kind of contacts Smokey will lead you to.

02:01.306 --> 02:04.169
That is the end of the story in the forest ranger's letter.

02:05.191 --> 02:11.598
Smokey, all I can say is keep up the good work you are doing in all fields.

02:12.219 --> 02:21.750
My head's off to that forest ranger, Miss Stanwyck, for helping a little boy to see the blue sky way out yonder, as the Sons of the Pioneers would put it.

02:28.801 --> 02:56.631
There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a roof over my head. There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a cupboard for my bed. And wherever I wander Or wherever I may roam There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a calling me home.

02:57.067 --> 02:59.736
I'm tired of roaming around

03:00.323 --> 03:28.575
Mighty tired, mighty blue. Somehow I never have found Any place like the home I once knew. There's a blue sky a way out yonder That's a roof over my head. There's a blue sky a way out yonder That's a cover for my bed. And wherever I wander

03:28.555 --> 03:38.622
Oh, wherever I may roam There's a blue sky way out yonder That's a calling me home. 

03:38.622 --> 03:53.000
[Music.]

03:53.000 --> 03:57.007
And wherever I wonder

03:57.007 --> 04:06.848
Or wherever I may roam There's a blue sky all way out yonder That's a calling me home.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.214
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:13.495 --> 04:17.705
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:17.745 --> 04:22.436
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to, that make these get-togethers possible.

04:23.078 --> 04:28.330
This is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember...

04:28.310 --> 04:31.213
Only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:31.393 --> 04:40.062
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:40.622 --> 04:44.666
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:44.706 --> 04:49.331
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:49.331 --> 05:08.216
[Music.]
