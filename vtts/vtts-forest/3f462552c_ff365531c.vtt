00:10.780 --> 00:17.127
Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:26.879 --> 00:34.628
Today we present the first in a series of programs on forest conservation, featuring Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:35.519 --> 00:37.582
Our scene is beaver dam forest.

00:37.602 --> 00:42.307
The sun, high in the heavens, is beating its bright, strong rays down upon the green-top trees.

00:43.048 --> 00:48.855
Only an occasional flicker of light penetrates to the bottom of Devil's Cove and its clear, rapidly-flowing stream.

00:49.656 --> 00:54.823
But the narrow trail, which runs perilously some 200 feet above the stream, is not so shaded.

00:55.343 --> 00:57.306
Here, the tree growth is less dense.

00:57.966 --> 01:03.433
The sun's glare beats unmercifully upon the two boys who are making their weary, cautious way along the trail.

01:03.650 --> 01:12.802
a travel route far more familiar to the hooves and paws of wild animals than to the faltering feet of two desperate youngsters fighting their way out of the bewildering forest.

01:13.362 --> 01:17.187
Suddenly, the lad who is lagging behind breaks a long silence.

01:21.473 --> 01:21.753
Joe?

01:22.434 --> 01:22.714
What?

01:23.275 --> 01:24.156
Joe, I'm scared.

01:24.777 --> 01:25.518
Good and scared.

01:25.538 --> 01:26.599
Oh, snap out of it, Sam.

01:26.639 --> 01:27.280
So we're lost.

01:27.380 --> 01:27.820
So what?

01:28.261 --> 01:28.982
We'll get out of here.

01:29.142 --> 01:31.024
Sometimes lost people stay lost, Joe.

01:31.164 --> 01:31.845
Don't talk like that.

01:31.865 --> 01:33.306
We shouldn't have left camp last night.

01:33.346 --> 01:36.009
We were free, right after we finished the supper dishes, weren't we?

01:36.029 --> 01:40.714
Yeah, but if we had waited until this morning for our hike in the woods, we wouldn't have gotten lost.

01:40.734 --> 01:41.936
Well, I'm not blaming you, Joe.

01:42.657 --> 01:44.158
We just didn't use our heads, that's all.

01:44.278 --> 01:44.939
Okay, fella.

01:45.359 --> 01:46.841
Say, what time do you think it is?

01:46.961 --> 01:48.163
I guess it's around noon.

01:48.463 --> 01:49.884
That's your stomach time, isn't it?

01:49.904 --> 01:50.605
Well, look at the sun.

01:50.926 --> 01:51.786
Just about overhead.

01:52.387 --> 01:53.508
That makes it midday, doesn't it?

01:54.049 --> 01:54.109
Mm.

01:54.578 --> 01:54.919
Yeah.

01:55.340 --> 01:56.182
Feeling better, Sam?

01:56.282 --> 01:56.803
I'm all right.

01:57.545 --> 01:58.768
Hungry as a bear, though, at that.

01:59.029 --> 02:00.913
I wonder if there are any bears around here.

02:00.933 --> 02:01.575
What'd you say, Joe?

02:01.795 --> 02:02.417
Oh, nothing.

02:02.898 --> 02:05.905
Just that I was hungry as a bear, too, and thirsty.

02:06.222 --> 02:07.583
Boy, am I thirsty.

02:07.603 --> 02:10.246
Say, Sam, let's drop down to that stream and fill up with water.

02:10.326 --> 02:11.067
I wouldn't, Joe.

02:11.167 --> 02:11.588
Why not?

02:11.968 --> 02:13.450
It looks clean and it's flowing fast.

02:13.490 --> 02:18.094
I read somewhere that it's a good idea not to take chances on drinking water, unless you're dead sure.

02:18.795 --> 02:22.879
Now, that water might be okay, but, well, I don't think we ought to take any chances.

02:22.899 --> 02:23.760
I guess you're right, Sam.

02:24.321 --> 02:27.784
What you and I don't know about nature and the great outdoors sure would fill a lot of books.

02:27.804 --> 02:31.268
You know, Joe, we've been following this trail a long time.

02:31.248 --> 02:32.951
Should have come out somewhere before this.

02:32.971 --> 02:34.333
At least we keep going downhill.

02:34.994 --> 02:37.377
That's something and besides we don't... Joe, look up ahead.

02:37.898 --> 02:38.659
Holy cow.

02:38.679 --> 02:39.240
It's a bear, Joe.

02:39.841 --> 02:41.904
Scraping its paws on the tree alongside the trail.

02:42.044 --> 02:42.925
A whopping big bear.

02:43.606 --> 02:43.927
Quiet.

02:44.528 --> 02:44.968
Don't move.

02:45.669 --> 02:46.330
I don't think he sees this.

02:46.350 --> 02:46.991
What are we going to do?

02:47.272 --> 02:48.614
Get off this trail and quick.

02:48.634 --> 02:48.994
Which way?

02:49.375 --> 02:49.475
Up.

02:49.916 --> 02:50.156
Yeah.

02:50.597 --> 02:52.199
There's less brushing and stuff that way.

02:52.700 --> 02:53.341
Let's cut through the woods.

02:53.361 --> 02:53.882
I'm ready, Joe.

02:54.402 --> 02:54.623
Now?

02:54.863 --> 02:55.784
Now.

02:55.804 --> 02:56.686
Okay, Joe, keep running.

02:56.806 --> 02:57.547
How are you doing?

02:57.567 --> 02:58.268
Behind you?

02:59.412 --> 03:00.213
How you doing, Sam?

03:00.233 --> 03:00.793
Not so good.

03:01.254 --> 03:01.994
This is rough going.

03:02.114 --> 03:03.436
We sure fooled that old bear, though.

03:03.756 --> 03:04.797
Never did see us, I bet.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.999
Yeah, out of the frying pan into the fire, that's us.

03:07.559 --> 03:09.341
We don't even have a trail to follow here.

03:09.501 --> 03:11.203
Sam, over there, look.

03:11.623 --> 03:12.384
Isn't that a clearing?

03:12.404 --> 03:13.004
You're right, Joe.

03:13.665 --> 03:15.687
And say, there's some kind of a building.

03:16.387 --> 03:17.348
Why, it's a little cabin.

03:17.488 --> 03:17.848
I see it.

03:18.529 --> 03:20.231
Boy, I wonder if there's any food in the place.

03:20.251 --> 03:21.031
Hey, what's this, Joe?

03:21.672 --> 03:23.113
All the little trees.

03:23.133 --> 03:26.696
Seems like there's miles and miles of small trees stretching away from the cabin.

03:26.716 --> 03:27.697
I wonder who planted them.

03:27.717 --> 03:28.558
Don't ask me.

03:29.197 --> 03:30.999
Gee, there's no one around now, not a soul.

03:31.580 --> 03:33.301
We're no better off... Let's take a look at the cabin.

03:33.762 --> 03:34.823
There's a sign on the door.

03:35.183 --> 03:36.385
Maybe it'll tell us where we are.

03:36.565 --> 03:39.108
A lot of good that'll do, but it doesn't tell us how to get out of here.

03:39.168 --> 03:41.590
And look, the windows are boarded up.

03:41.610 --> 03:42.551
No one here, Joe.

03:42.992 --> 03:43.673
We're sunk.

03:43.813 --> 03:44.934
Doggone the luck, Sam.

03:44.954 --> 03:46.556
Did you read that sign?

03:46.936 --> 03:50.320
This is Beaver Dam Forest property.

03:50.340 --> 03:56.066
All persons are prohibited under penalty of the law from committing any trespassing.

03:56.086 --> 03:56.927
Reward $100.

03:56.947 --> 03:57.988
$100.

03:58.863 --> 04:06.478
will be paid for information leading to the arrest and conviction of any person charged with destroying or stealing any... Okay, okay, quit it.

04:06.899 --> 04:07.520
Now what?

04:07.541 --> 04:09.244
There might be some food in that cabin, Sam.

04:09.825 --> 04:11.889
If we could just get something to eat.

04:11.909 --> 04:13.733
Maybe these boards aren't on very tight.

04:15.637 --> 04:16.599
Joe, don't be a fool.

04:17.099 --> 04:18.061
You can't break in.

04:18.462 --> 04:19.203
Remember the sign?

04:19.283 --> 04:20.445
Nobody would want us to starve.

04:20.946 --> 04:22.549
Now we can't get in this way.

04:22.629 --> 04:24.612
Joe, let's rest up a bit and then push on.

04:25.173 --> 04:27.417
There ought to be a road or a trail out of this place.

04:27.437 --> 04:28.398
We can find it, Joe.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.460
We'll pay for what we eat.

04:29.921 --> 04:30.562
Leave our names.

04:30.782 --> 04:31.564
That'll make it okay.

04:31.584 --> 04:32.986
Don't break into the cabin, Joe.

04:33.006 --> 04:33.166
Here.

04:33.727 --> 04:34.529
This poor ought to do it.

04:34.929 --> 04:35.611
Get away, Sam.

04:35.631 --> 04:36.192
Joe, please.

04:37.834 --> 04:38.996
No need to do that, fellas.

04:39.036 --> 04:40.058
I've got a key for that.

04:40.477 --> 04:40.978
Who are you?

04:41.399 --> 04:42.201
Where did you come from?

04:42.221 --> 04:43.524
He's got a badge on his shirt, Joe.

04:43.744 --> 04:44.967
My name's Bill Scott, boys.

04:45.307 --> 04:47.111
I'm the ranger here on Beaver Dam Forest.

04:47.151 --> 04:49.697
Now, if you'll just step aside, I'll open that door for you.

04:49.717 --> 04:50.939
We've been lost since yesterday.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.705
Both of us are starved to death and thirsty, too.

04:53.725 --> 04:55.209
And we nearly had a running with a big bear.

04:55.289 --> 04:57.052
Well, most bears are like most people.

04:57.093 --> 04:59.177
They won't bother you if you don't bother them.

04:59.157 --> 05:24.203
now that's it come on in boys and watch your step it's kind of dark inside we were going to pay for everything we ate mr no no no no no my friends call me ranger bill and there's no reason why you can't do the same i'm sam freeman this is joe mcguire howdy boys we're both dishwashers at the boys camp on pine lake if i wasn't so hungry i wouldn't have tried by the way when did you boys eat last separate camp about seven o'clock last night golly seems like a week ago i know how that is it is dark in here

05:24.183 --> 05:25.024
I'll tell you what you do.

05:25.084 --> 05:26.505
Open a couple of those shutters, Sam.

05:26.545 --> 05:27.907
They hook on the inside.

05:28.027 --> 05:28.668
Yes, sir.

05:28.688 --> 05:29.789
We thought they were just four.

05:30.750 --> 05:31.611
Ah, that's much better.

05:31.991 --> 05:33.333
We can really see something now.

05:33.453 --> 05:35.415
Yeah, but I don't see any food, though.

05:35.455 --> 05:37.777
Nothing but empty shells and a lot of tools.

05:38.218 --> 05:38.938
Shovels and stuff.

05:38.978 --> 05:39.619
That's right, Joe.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.903
Now, suppose you trot outside and bring in my knapsack, hmm?

05:42.923 --> 05:44.184
I left it at the corner of the cabin.

05:44.204 --> 05:44.744
Yes, sir.

05:44.764 --> 05:46.286
We didn't hear you come up on us, Ranger.

05:46.306 --> 05:48.148
Well, you were both pretty busy at the time.

05:48.398 --> 05:52.343
Then, too, your ordinary woodsman doesn't make very much noise traveling in the woods.

05:52.744 --> 05:55.107
You see, you hear more and see more that way.

05:55.327 --> 05:56.188
I get what you mean, sir.

05:56.929 --> 06:00.153
But look, Joe, he's a swell guy, honestly.

06:00.253 --> 06:01.775
He wouldn't have done... Oh, here's Joe with my knapsack.

06:01.815 --> 06:02.476
Right over here, Joe.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.598
This is mighty heavy, Ranger.

06:03.938 --> 06:04.819
You lug it on your back?

06:05.100 --> 06:05.921
Only when I have to.

06:06.401 --> 06:07.563
All right, set it up on the table.

06:08.644 --> 06:09.465
Now, open it up, boys.

06:09.966 --> 06:13.731
You'll find some roast beef sandwiches in there, and... Oh, yeah, here's a hot...

06:14.234 --> 06:16.844
Thug of hot soup right in that thermos, John.

06:16.884 --> 06:17.085
Oh, boy.

06:17.326 --> 06:18.008
Me for the soup.

06:18.390 --> 06:20.618
Dig in, fellas, but take it easy, will you?

06:20.980 --> 06:22.827
Gosh, this soup tastes swell.

06:23.309 --> 06:23.550
Yeah.

06:23.570 --> 06:23.670
Yeah.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.921
Sam and I, we're crazy about the woods, Ranger Bill.

06:27.301 --> 06:31.306
We plan to spend every bit of our time going hiking, learning about nature, things like that.

06:31.746 --> 06:35.330
We get a day off every week, and we just thought... Oh, and yesterday was your first day off, I take it?

06:35.390 --> 06:36.391
Today, really?

06:36.411 --> 06:38.193
Were you not due back in camp until this evening?

06:38.213 --> 06:40.395
Well, you certainly made a good start, didn't you?

06:40.656 --> 06:41.817
I mean, getting back to nature.

06:41.957 --> 06:43.699
How far are we from our camp, Ranger Bill?

06:43.939 --> 06:46.082
Oh, I'd say about 12 miles, Sam.

06:46.102 --> 06:49.385
Two miles by foot and 10 miles by my pickup truck, the way we'll go back.

06:49.585 --> 06:51.648
About my trying to break into the cabin, Ranger Bill.

06:51.828 --> 06:52.529
Will you see... Joe?

06:53.590 --> 06:53.910
Yes, sir.

06:54.211 --> 06:55.753
No real harm was done, son.

06:56.293 --> 06:58.055
That's only because you got here in time.

06:58.295 --> 06:59.577
All right, we'll leave it at that, huh?

06:59.857 --> 07:01.919
I won't pull a stunt like that again ever.

07:01.939 --> 07:03.601
That's good enough for me, Joe.

07:03.621 --> 07:05.423
Now, look, you two, I want to... Yes, sir.

07:05.443 --> 07:07.265
Well, I want to tell you something.

07:07.285 --> 07:11.409
You mustn't let this experience mess up your interest in knowing all you can about the forest.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.292
Now, look, anyone can get lost, even the best woodsman.

07:14.312 --> 07:15.273
Do you mean that, Ranger Bill?

07:15.674 --> 07:16.234
Well, I'll tell you.

07:16.274 --> 07:22.140
I'm thinking about Forest Ranger McConnell of the Thunder Mountain country in Idaho and what happened to him years ago.

07:23.141 --> 07:23.762
Well, boys...

07:24.046 --> 07:28.171
One winter morning, the telephone rang in his cabin far back in the wilderness.

07:28.191 --> 07:32.037
Now, he was ordered to attend a meeting at a ranger station 80 miles away.

07:32.057 --> 07:36.362
So he started on that long snowshoe trip through the snow and forest.

07:36.382 --> 07:37.564
It was cold and clear.

07:38.125 --> 07:43.692
And his only trail was a single strand of telephone wire overhead that stretched for miles through those rugged mountains.

07:44.110 --> 07:51.262
Well, Mac got to feeling so good and the weather was so fine that he decided to try a shortcut away from the telephone line that was his only guide.

07:52.003 --> 07:53.626
And it was almost a fatal mistake.

07:53.706 --> 07:54.227
What happened?

07:54.587 --> 07:58.934
Well, Mac got caught in a storm that came up suddenly, a howling, whipping blizzard.

07:58.954 --> 08:02.220
And his next three days and nights were terrible, terrifying even to him.

08:02.861 --> 08:05.545
He spent one night huddled in the shelter of an overhanging bluff.

08:05.828 --> 08:09.832
another night beside a big rock, and the third night in an old trapper's cabin.

08:10.533 --> 08:16.619
And here he found his only food, a bit of coffee, some sugar, and a can of frozen milk.

08:16.639 --> 08:18.201
He got out all right, didn't he, Ranger Bill?

08:18.281 --> 08:21.925
Yes, Sam, he did, but only by bullheaded courage and a will to live.

08:22.646 --> 08:27.691
Each day as he struggled through the snow, he kept fighting the desire to lay down and end his awful nightmare.

08:28.492 --> 08:34.418
Well, after several days of stumbling and fighting through, he fell across something hard and brittle.

08:34.550 --> 08:39.675
It was the top wire of a pasture fence, and it finally led him to a ranger station and safety.

08:39.695 --> 08:41.377
And that's a true story, Ranger Bill?

08:41.517 --> 08:42.317
Yes, Sam, it is.

08:42.518 --> 08:49.725
Of course, I shortened it up some, but it's one of a collection of fine stories about forest rangers that you can find in a book at your library back home.

08:49.745 --> 08:57.832
Gee, it must be a great life being a forest ranger, knowing all about trees and animals, rescuing lost people, fishing, hunting, things like that.

08:57.913 --> 09:01.536
Yes, Sam, but that's what most people think of us rangers, all right.

09:01.735 --> 09:03.097
It's not entirely true, though.

09:03.117 --> 09:04.319
What do you mean by that?

09:04.339 --> 09:08.105
Well, simply that a ranger's life is not one big bowl of cherries.

09:08.125 --> 09:13.955
For example, I didn't come up here to this plantation today to fish or hunt or even rescue a couple of young explorers.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.617
Why did you come out, Ranger Bill?

09:15.637 --> 09:17.340
Well, to see how those trees were coming along.

09:17.821 --> 09:20.886
Now, if you've had enough to eat, let's go outside and I'll show you what I mean.

09:20.966 --> 09:21.747
I'm through.

09:21.767 --> 09:22.689
Me too.

09:22.709 --> 09:23.490
Well, let's go.

09:25.597 --> 09:29.442
Now, this, boys, is one of the largest plantations in the Beaver Dam Forest.

09:29.782 --> 09:36.170
5,000 acres, 5 million trees, about 1,000 to an acre, and all growing into a new forest.

09:36.190 --> 09:38.073
Boy, that sure is a lot of trees.

09:38.113 --> 09:39.134
You said plantation.

09:39.475 --> 09:40.696
Then Joe was right.

09:40.716 --> 09:42.538
All these trees were planted by hand.

09:42.558 --> 09:43.359
Exactly, Sam.

09:44.201 --> 09:47.625
A lot of work is represented here in these young, growing trees.

09:47.645 --> 09:50.929
Many weeks of harvesting seed, planting it in our nursery.

09:51.314 --> 09:56.930
watering the young seedlings, cultivating and protecting them from droughts, disease, insects, and animals.

09:56.950 --> 10:05.374
And then picking out only the healthiest trees, discarding the weaklings, bringing the good trees in here, and then the back-breaking work of planting them.

10:06.181 --> 10:09.087
No, it's not so cheap, nor is it easy to plant a new forest.

10:09.107 --> 10:14.318
And after all that work, you've got to keep looking after them, protecting them, making sure they'll grow big and strong.

10:14.398 --> 10:15.260
Yes, Joe, that's it.

10:15.861 --> 10:21.994
And that isn't always romantic or pleasant, though it does give a fellow a real kick when he plants a new forest.

10:22.014 --> 10:24.679
He knows that it means toys and tables and homes.

10:25.182 --> 10:26.724
Homes for many, many people.

10:26.984 --> 10:29.727
Why did you have to plant all these trees here, Ranger Bill?

10:29.747 --> 10:32.510
How else would you get this new forest the Ranger's talking about, Sam?

10:32.610 --> 10:36.354
Well, I believe what Sam had in mind was why didn't we let Mother Nature do the work?

10:36.374 --> 10:37.916
And it's a good question, Sam.

10:37.936 --> 10:38.737
Hey, that's right.

10:39.137 --> 10:42.561
How come this forest didn't grow just by itself, like most forests?

10:42.581 --> 10:43.442
Well, I'll tell you, Joe.

10:44.123 --> 10:46.565
Because of destructive logging and then fire.

10:47.166 --> 10:50.970
Yes, when they join forces, they usually give old Mother Nature a terrific beating.

10:51.811 --> 10:56.576
Ten years ago, before this became public forest, this whole area was a shambles.

10:56.596 --> 10:59.158
Axes and saws had cleaned almost every tree off.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.342
And then a raging fire swept up what was left.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.343
So you had to plant.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.044
Yes, Joe, we had to plant.

11:05.084 --> 11:08.588
There would have been no trees here for years to come if we hadn't planted.

11:08.608 --> 11:09.489
Look, Ranger, over there.

11:09.949 --> 11:11.070
Isn't that a fire in the woods?

11:11.371 --> 11:12.312
What do you mean, Sam?

11:12.532 --> 11:13.513
That's the sun setting.

11:13.813 --> 11:17.577
I'm afraid it fools some of our very best fire look out sometimes, that setting sun.

11:17.597 --> 11:20.119
That sounds as if you have another story for us, Ranger Bill.

11:20.139 --> 11:21.801
Well, no, not now, Sam.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.926
I expect we'd better head back for camp.

11:24.206 --> 11:25.649
You're due back about now, aren't you?

11:25.849 --> 11:27.692
Gee, I forgot all about camp.

11:27.712 --> 11:28.293
Ranger Bill?

11:28.533 --> 11:29.014
Yes, Sam?

11:29.495 --> 11:34.263
Ranger Bill, could we, Joe and I, could we go out with you again sometime?

11:34.343 --> 11:34.804
Oh, boy.

11:35.024 --> 11:37.909
Will you let us, Ranger Bill, on our day off next week, maybe?

11:38.189 --> 11:39.472
Sure, if you really want to.

11:39.492 --> 11:40.413
Oh, that's swell.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.218
That is, if you don't mind a young lady coming along.

11:43.318 --> 11:43.839
Oh, girl.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.842
It's my niece, June Cameron.

11:46.223 --> 11:48.767
She's coming out to stay at the girls' camp at the other side of the lake.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.384
Gee, we won't mind that at all, Ranger.

11:50.404 --> 11:54.489
Well, then next time I'd like to take you boys out to where some logging is going on in the forest.

11:54.509 --> 11:56.331
Not the same kind of logging they did here?

11:56.611 --> 12:00.556
No, Sam, I don't think it'll be necessary to plant that area after it's logged.

12:00.576 --> 12:04.261
Fortunately, there are good logging methods as well as bad ones.

12:04.281 --> 12:05.943
Say, Joe, what makes you so quiet?

12:06.563 --> 12:07.524
What are you staring at?

12:07.544 --> 12:08.245
That sunset.

12:08.926 --> 12:09.587
Look at it, will you?

12:09.987 --> 12:14.653
The colors, red and purple, and those gold rays shooting the forest through and through.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.760
It's beautiful, isn't it, Ranger Bill?

12:16.780 --> 12:17.381
It certainly is.

12:17.501 --> 12:18.802
We ought to start back to camp.

12:19.023 --> 12:21.285
Well, enjoy the sunset with Joe, Sam.

12:21.305 --> 12:24.148
I'll lock up the cabin, and then we'll head back to your pine lake.

12:24.568 --> 12:27.571
You know, Sam, this was some break for us meeting Ranger Bill.

12:27.611 --> 12:28.973
He's a swell guy, all right.

12:29.413 --> 12:33.197
And boy, I can't wait till next week when he takes us out to that logging job.

12:33.677 --> 12:35.639
That ought to be really something, Joe.

12:43.167 --> 12:43.307
The End

12:45.363 --> 13:14.087
Yes, as Sam says, that ought to be really something for all of us when we hit that forest trail again next week with Ranger Bill and an exciting story about crashing timber.

13:14.708 --> 13:21.617
And say, if you want that book Ranger Bill spoke about earlier in the program, get a pencil and write down the title.

13:21.637 --> 13:22.698
Here it is.

13:22.718 --> 13:25.882
Rangers of the Shield by Ovid Butler.

13:25.902 --> 13:26.503
How'd you get that?

13:27.123 --> 13:30.287
Rangers of the Shield by Ovid Butler.

13:31.569 --> 13:36.295
Bill Scott, forest ranger, comes to you with a cooperation of the Forest Service, U.S.

13:36.335 --> 13:37.576
Department of Agriculture.

13:38.117 --> 13:43.163
Bill Scott is written by Bill Bergoffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokhan.

13:43.835 --> 13:48.141
Your announcer has been Bob Geist.
