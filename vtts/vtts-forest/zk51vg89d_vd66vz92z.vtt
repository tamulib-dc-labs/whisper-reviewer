00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
[Silence.]

00:09.000 --> 00:18.000
[Music.]

00:18.067 --> 00:21.401
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:21.821 --> 00:25.226
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

00:25.927 --> 00:29.572
Hi there, friends, I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodman.

00:29.592 --> 00:32.216
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:32.236 --> 00:37.503
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:37.523 --> 00:39.285
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:40.430 --> 00:44.449
That's cause we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:44.469 --> 00:49.292
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:50.082 --> 00:56.810
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the Sons of the Pioneers.

00:56.830 --> 00:57.431
Hi, Billy.

00:57.451 --> 01:00.174
I've got a little thought here to start off with.

01:00.194 --> 01:19.296
You know, if all of us just get solid behind Smokey Bear and support him in this campaign against man-caused forest fires, if every last one of us backs up old Smokey to the hilt by being more careful than ever with fire, why, things will sure look up in the wings all over the country.

01:20.238 --> 01:24.105
You know, Smokey Bear is kind of like a Boss Hanging Out a Rainbow.

01:24.125 --> 01:24.826
Is that right, fellas?

01:24.826 --> 01:33.402
[Music.]

01:33.402 --> 01:39.833
Hi-ho, why should I be grieving?

01:42.530 --> 02:11.592
Stormy clouds are leavin'. The boss is hangin' out a rainbow. Hi-ho, now the grass is greener. Air is cool and cleaner. The boss is hangin' out a rainbow.

02:15.554 --> 02:26.106
I saw him throw his lariat, a braided lightning strand.

02:26.126 --> 02:35.817
I saw him catch those angry clouds and burn them with his brand.

02:35.837 --> 02:42.304
Hi-ho, now the sun is blazing.

02:44.967 --> 02:49.332
Hungry cattle grazing.

02:49.352 --> 02:56.119
The boss is hanging out a rainbow.

02:56.139 --> 03:01.846
I saw him throw his lariat,

03:01.866 --> 03:07.612
a braided lightning strand.

03:07.632 --> 03:13.118
I saw him catch those angry clouds and burn them with his brand.

03:13.570 --> 03:43.290
Hi-ho, now the sun is blazing. Hungry cattle grazing. The boss is hanging out a rainbow. The boss is hanging out a rainbow. Rainbow.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.634
Yes, sir.

03:50.654 --> 03:54.400
Smokey Bear is kind of like a boss hanging out a rainbow.

03:55.922 --> 03:59.747
He needs plenty of help, though, in this business of preventing fire.

04:00.869 --> 04:07.078
No matter who you are, whatever you do, wherever you live, you can help.

04:07.118 --> 04:13.388
You can help by being extra, extra careful with fire outdoors.

04:13.408 --> 04:14.329
Think about it this way.

04:14.890 --> 04:19.116
How much time does it take, really, to be careful instead of careless?

04:20.108 --> 04:22.071
To be thoughtful instead of thoughtless.

04:23.073 --> 04:24.675
Very little time.

04:24.695 --> 04:25.416
How much effort?

04:26.278 --> 04:27.960
Very little.

04:27.980 --> 04:40.179
But if every single one of us invested that little bit of time, that little bit of extra effort, what tremendous dividends we would have in forests and woods, free from fire.

04:41.942 --> 04:47.871
With his ranger's hat and shovel and a pair of dungarees, you will find him in the forest.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.683
Always sniffing at the breeze.

04:49.984 --> 04:54.171
People stop and pay attention when he tells them to beware.

04:54.191 --> 04:57.616
Cause everybody knows that he's the fire preventin' bear.

04:58.317 --> 05:01.742
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

05:02.203 --> 05:05.709
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

05:06.350 --> 05:09.695
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

05:10.096 --> 05:13.521
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

05:13.822 --> 05:31.543
Smokey the bear.

05:31.760 --> 05:37.228
Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

05:37.788 --> 05:41.153
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

05:41.534 --> 05:45.619
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

05:45.640 --> 05:50.606
So let's remember Smokey and how he got his name.

05:52.810 --> 05:57.396
Like Smokey, all of us should realize there's more than just lumber in trees.

05:58.169 --> 06:02.594
By preventing fires, we help to protect the water values of the land and its beauty.

06:03.394 --> 06:04.836
We protect wild fishing.

06:05.477 --> 06:07.399
We safeguard picnic and campgrounds.

06:08.460 --> 06:12.844
These are the things that Smokey Bear stands for in your behalf and mine.

06:14.085 --> 06:18.290
And Smokey can only go so far in preventing forest fires as we go ourselves.

06:19.671 --> 06:25.257
Won't it be a great day in the morning when we finally lick this business of forest fires that start through killing?

06:26.705 --> 06:30.551
Sun to the Pioneers, how about a song?

06:31.092 --> 06:48.679
Come on and pull away your troubles, get them to the moon, And tell all your worries for free. Cause there's a great day coming, can't you hear them all humming. It's a cowboy jubilee. If you've got lots of leisure time and nothing else to do

06:49.132 --> 07:02.972
And wanna be happy as we Just grab your hat, get your boots on pretty soon You'll be long gone to that cowboy jubilee. Just hear that cowboy band a-playin'

07:03.340 --> 07:09.348
You know your blues won't mean a thing when you get in the swing.

07:09.688 --> 07:11.891
A cowboy's life is for me.

07:12.612 --> 07:18.627
Soon all your cares you'll be sheddin', and like me, you'll be headin' to the cowboy jubilee.

07:18.627 --> 07:45.000
[Music.]

07:45.710 --> 08:11.940
Just hear the cowboy band a-playin' See the couples out there swayin' You know your blues won't mean a thing when you get in the swing A cowboy's life is for me. Soon all your cares you'll be sheddin' And like me, you'll be headin' to the cowboy jubilee. Cowboy jubilee.

08:14.047 --> 08:16.069
Yes, sir.

08:16.089 --> 08:24.418
It's always a lot of fun, isn't it, when folks get together at a jubilee or house party, at a county fair or a town meeting.

08:25.660 --> 08:31.766
That's when folks get things done, working together, whether it's for fun or community good.

08:33.008 --> 08:34.489
You see what I'm getting at, don't you?

08:35.691 --> 08:41.657
It's going to take a lot of folks working together, each doing his individual bit in support of Smokey.

08:42.278 --> 08:44.661
to whip the forest fire problem in this country.

08:45.922 --> 08:50.247
Every concentrated effort should have a creed of some sort.

08:50.267 --> 08:53.251
Here's a fine outdoor pledge some of you may have heard before.

08:53.972 --> 08:56.094
It goes like this.

08:56.114 --> 09:10.311
I give my pledge as an American to save and faithfully to defend from waste the natural resources of my country, its soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.

09:11.607 --> 09:16.294
Now, if we will just follow this creed... Oh, hold on right there a minute, Billy.

09:16.395 --> 09:27.893
If everyone gets back of Smokey, gives him his full support in his campaign against forest fires, why, there's no telling how far we can push on to a brighter day for America's forests.

09:28.754 --> 09:32.661
Some folks say there are no new frontiers in this great country of ours.

09:33.061 --> 09:34.624
Now, don't you believe it.

09:34.644 --> 09:38.610
We've just begun to move against that old red devil fire.

09:39.215 --> 09:49.870
And if we can just get past him, we'll be seeing greener forests, more productive forest lands, more opportunities for jobs and fun, more stable supplies of water.

09:50.331 --> 09:53.155
So Smokey stands for a new frontier, all right.

09:53.815 --> 09:58.041
A land free from fire started through carelessness or thoughtlessness.

09:58.963 --> 10:05.492
We've got a song, The Sons of the Pioneers and myself, and we're going to sing it as a kind of a campaign song for Smokey.

10:06.053 --> 10:06.353
Fellas?

10:07.885 --> 10:33.893
There's a blue sky above And a land that I love Out on the new frontier. There's a moon shining bright And the stars every night Light up the new frontier.

10:34.666 --> 10:39.573
Hurryin', scurryin', what's the use of worryin'?

10:40.013 --> 10:43.899
Life is a happy song.

10:44.079 --> 10:53.933
From a world of care and strife, there I'll find a peaceful light, far from the busy throng.

10:53.953 --> 11:00.522
There's a blue sky above, and a land that I love,

11:01.008 --> 11:29.698
Out on the new frontier. There's a moon shining bright And the stars every night Light up the new frontier. Moonbeams and starlight Blending as one. Fade into daybreak When night is done. I'll stake my claim there

11:29.982 --> 11:38.109
Under the sun, out on the new frontier.

11:38.129 --> 11:45.736
Out on the new frontier.

11:45.756 --> 11:48.319
Well, would you look who's coming up the trail now.

11:48.339 --> 11:52.983
Big as life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all talked out in dungarees.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.785
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

11:56.226 --> 11:57.627
He's the popular candidate.

11:57.961 --> 12:01.025
the people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:01.826 --> 12:04.430
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:05.071 --> 12:06.733
Hello there, friends.

12:07.233 --> 12:08.475
I need your support.

12:08.856 --> 12:11.599
Help me bring an end to carelessness with fire.

12:12.020 --> 12:16.746
Please follow these four easy but very important rules.

12:16.766 --> 12:18.689
One, break every match in two.

12:18.969 --> 12:20.431
Make sure it's dead out.

12:20.812 --> 12:23.035
Two, crush out every smoke.

12:23.055 --> 12:25.198
When driving, use your ashtray.

12:25.598 --> 12:26.179
Three...

12:26.328 --> 12:27.950
Drown every campfire.

12:28.751 --> 12:32.436
Or use care in burning anything outdoors.

12:32.456 --> 12:33.578
Check the law.

12:33.598 --> 12:35.340
Take no chances at all.

12:35.981 --> 12:36.782
Thank you, folks.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.366
Well, I'll be seeing you.

12:40.508 --> 12:42.170
And there he goes down the trail.

12:42.951 --> 12:43.992
Thank you, Smokey.

12:45.374 --> 12:49.260
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

12:50.241 --> 12:53.145
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine trees.

12:54.155 --> 12:59.861
The sons of the pioneers, and I hope you have enjoyed these little meetings on the trail as much as we have.

13:00.862 --> 13:14.376
We'd like to remind you that it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to, that have made these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:14.396 --> 13:17.800
Until some fine day when we say hi to each other again.

13:18.353 --> 13:27.910
This is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the sons of the pioneers, hoping you'll get on the Smokey bandwagon.

13:27.930 --> 13:34.823
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forests, woods, and range fires.

13:35.684 --> 13:39.872
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

13:40.173 --> 13:44.081
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:44.682 --> 13:47.148
He can find a fire before...

13:47.188 --> 13:50.094
That's why they call him Smokey...name.

13:50.114 --> 13:51.397
Smokey...

13:51.417 --> 13:54.703
Prowlin' and a-growlin'...can find a fire.

13:54.723 --> 13:55.465
...Smokey, that was...
