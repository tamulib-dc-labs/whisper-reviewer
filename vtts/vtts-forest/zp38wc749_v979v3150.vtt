00:09.683 --> 00:21.459
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.602
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:23.622 --> 00:25.384
That was how he got his name.

00:25.945 --> 00:26.786
Hi there, friends.

00:26.866 --> 00:29.450
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:29.470 --> 00:31.232
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:31.913 --> 00:35.738
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:36.900 --> 00:38.442
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:39.316 --> 00:42.019
That's because we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:43.101 --> 00:49.288
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and a story or two about our rangelands.

00:50.129 --> 00:56.236
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the Sons of the Pioneers.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.358
And here's Lloyd Perryman.

00:57.838 --> 01:03.825
Our first song is about that fine fellow who works closest to the cattle and grass, the cow folk.

01:03.845 --> 01:07.770
Now, he's got a real stake, and I'm not trying to be funny.

01:08.105 --> 01:18.301
He's got a real stake in keeping the grass growing and the cattle fat, the cowpoke.

01:23.068 --> 01:31.902
I'm lonesome but happy, rich but I'm broke, and the good Lord knows the reason I'm just a cowpoke.

01:32.270 --> 01:59.357
From Cheyenne to Douglas, all the ranges I know Cause adrift with the wind, no one cares where I go I ain't got a dime in these old wore-out jeans So I'll stop eatin' steak and I'll go back to beans

01:59.742 --> 02:02.745
I'll pick up a tin spot in Prescott.

02:02.865 --> 02:07.811
I know we're riding the Bronx in the big rodeo.

02:19.724 --> 02:28.433
Some evening in springtime, a filly I'll find and I might spend all summer on my mind.

02:29.071 --> 02:57.340
but i'll never be branded never be broke i'm a carefree range riding driftin couple who who who who who

02:59.547 --> 03:10.504
I guess just about everybody knows what the range country looks like with all the cowboy pictures we've seen and with all the traveling folks are doing these days across the country.

03:10.524 --> 03:21.682
But I wonder how many of us realize just how much the range lands mean to us in terms of meat for the table, leather gloves and jackets and shoes for all of us.

03:21.702 --> 03:26.449
And of course the grass and other plants on the range do more than serve as food for livestock.

03:27.020 --> 03:30.264
They also serve as a protective cover for the land itself.

03:31.225 --> 03:37.152
And where you've got such protection, you're not likely to have erosion or serious floods.

03:37.172 --> 03:39.194
Oh, we get a lot from our rangeland, all right.

03:39.995 --> 03:42.498
And not the least of it, beauty.

03:42.518 --> 03:47.925
So typically American, especially at night.

03:47.945 --> 03:53.972
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:54.610 --> 04:17.428
When the curtains of night are pinned back by the stars and the beautiful moon sweeps the sky,

04:18.100 --> 04:23.627
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers.

04:42.392 --> 04:46.437
When the curtains of night are pinned back,

04:47.193 --> 05:16.643
by the stars and the dew drops of heaven kiss the rose I'll remember you love in my prayers yes it's usually cool and peaceful on the range at night but during the day in the summer months the open range can get tender dry from the hot sun for the lack of rain because they are so open

05:17.028 --> 05:21.173
That makes them especially vulnerable to widespread damage from fire.

05:22.354 --> 05:26.959
It doesn't take much to start a terrible range fire racing across the land.

05:26.979 --> 05:32.886
A lighted match carelessly flipped aside, or a burning cigarette thoughtlessly flipped from a car window.

05:33.327 --> 05:35.329
That's all it takes.

05:35.349 --> 05:39.193
Now, I'm sure the sons of the pioneers have had personal experiences along this line.

05:39.794 --> 05:40.555
How about it, Lloyd?

05:40.872 --> 05:44.356
Well, we're talking about the range and range fires.

05:44.376 --> 05:46.138
Tommy Doss has some ideas on this.

05:46.158 --> 05:47.719
What do you say we hear them, Tommy?

05:47.739 --> 05:51.783
I was just thinking how pretty a well-managed protected range is.

05:51.803 --> 05:56.528
With enough grass and other forage growing to accommodate a good herd of cattle or sheep.

05:57.149 --> 06:02.975
Enough grass to go around and still be left in condition to produce a new crop year after year.

06:02.995 --> 06:04.677
There's real beauty there.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.840
Man and nature and livestock all in tune, you might say.

06:08.221 --> 06:08.601
Then...

06:08.868 --> 06:14.173
As I've seen for myself, someone lets fire loose and, well, everything's out of tune.

06:14.454 --> 06:15.735
You know what I mean, Lloyd?

06:15.755 --> 06:24.664
I sure do, Tommy, and I know, too, that your intelligent cowboy isn't usually the guy who lets the fire get loose and the grass that gives him is living.

06:24.684 --> 06:29.769
Everyone can take a lesson from him and be careful with fire anywhere near the range.

06:30.290 --> 06:34.774
But now, Tommy, get a straddle of that horse of yours because roundup time is over.

06:35.075 --> 06:54.636
Everything's lookin' bright and my heart's feelin' right And the world is mine for round-up time is over Every cowboy I know, Curly, Slim, Jack and Joe They're feelin' fine for round-up time is over

06:54.616 --> 07:22.750
See that little doggie hurry to the pole Yes, he knows just how I feel Spirit's high, clear blue sky, so why should he be told That way out here a cowboy's life is real Let the sun fill the sky, let the wild coyotes ride Everything's in rhyme, round-up time is over Hear the cowboys singing, they're a-feeling mighty gay

07:23.084 --> 07:26.590
Roundup time is over and their cares are laid away.

07:27.150 --> 07:30.696
See the doggies millin' with the brand new branded high.

07:31.197 --> 07:34.662
They were born a year ago and that's why cowboys ride.

07:34.803 --> 07:39.029
Everything's lookin' bright and my heart's feelin' right.

07:39.049 --> 07:42.295
And the world is mine for roundup time is over.

07:42.876 --> 07:50.728
Every cowboy I know, Curly, Slim, Jack and Joe, they're feelin' fine for roundup time is over.

07:51.181 --> 07:59.374
See that little dogey hurry to the fore, guess he knows just how I feel.

07:59.394 --> 08:07.026
Spirits high, clear blue sky, so why should he be told that way out here a cowboy's life is real?

08:07.086 --> 08:11.192
Let the sun fill the sky, let the wild coyotes cry.

08:11.493 --> 08:19.365
Everything's in rhyme for roundup time, roundup time is over on the race.

08:19.953 --> 08:21.255
Roundup time is over.

08:22.636 --> 08:28.103
Yes, sir, every year for some ranchers, roundup time is over before it's even started.

08:29.265 --> 08:31.688
Usually because someone was careless with fire.

08:32.869 --> 08:35.152
And they can be terrible, these range fires.

08:35.973 --> 08:45.586
They not only damage valuable grazing lands and watersheds, but sometimes they even burn up livestock, farms, and ranches.

08:45.606 --> 08:49.791
I wonder if you remember one of the big range fires that hit in a western state a while back.

08:50.699 --> 08:54.983
It all started one day when a rancher decided to burn the rubbish in his wheat field.

08:55.804 --> 09:01.890
He took a good look at the sky and figured that the weather was right and decided it was safe enough to take a chance.

09:03.191 --> 09:06.114
Well, sir, as the rubbish burned, something happened.

09:06.654 --> 09:07.575
The usual thing.

09:08.316 --> 09:13.021
The unpredictable wind came up and pretty soon it was blowing at 50 miles an hour.

09:14.142 --> 09:17.685
That rancher's rubbish fire spread across his own grazing land and

09:17.935 --> 09:20.798
roared on across the ranges of his friends and neighbors.

09:21.819 --> 09:24.502
It took 500 men to lick the fire.

09:24.522 --> 09:30.289
Four men were killed, and a number of them suffered burns and other injuries.

09:30.369 --> 09:33.152
50,000 acres of grazing land burned.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.876
Cattle were killed and tons of hay were consumed.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.200
Do you remember what the price of that rubbish fire was?

09:40.220 --> 09:42.622
$300,000.

09:42.843 --> 09:46.727
You can imagine how awful that rancher felt.

09:47.635 --> 09:52.239
The sad truth, friends, is that we do pay an awful price for carelessness.

09:53.020 --> 10:01.208
We've just got to be extra careful with matches, smokes, campfires, rubbish fires, any fire.

10:01.228 --> 10:03.189
I've got a yarn I'd like to spin.

10:03.249 --> 10:07.073
If you don't mind, I'll start right in about the meanest horse I ever knew.

10:08.534 --> 10:14.740
Well, I got aboard this onerous brute that ever jumped out from a chute, and with each jump, that critter tossed a shoe.

10:15.614 --> 10:23.101
Well, I grabbed a horn, I grabbed some hair, I really grabbed most everywhere, and the way he squealed and bellowed was a sin.

10:23.121 --> 10:28.827
He made a jump, then turned around, I made a deal, hit the ground, bounced right up, and started in again.

10:30.088 --> 10:37.656
He's a killer, he's a killer, killer dealer, killer dealer, he's a graveyard filler off the west.

10:37.676 --> 10:43.782
As I was saying before I quit, I grabbed a horn, I pulled a bit, I rode that ornery critter like a dog.

10:44.690 --> 10:50.836
He turned around and said to me, old cowboy, you just wait and see, I'll water you just like a hairy hawk.

10:51.997 --> 10:58.363
Well, a crowd applauded out with glee, and the bronco looked again at me and said, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

10:59.264 --> 11:01.106
You've made a mess of things, old kid.

11:01.126 --> 11:02.888
You blew your top, flipped your lid.

11:02.908 --> 11:04.289
You shouldn't have oughta done it.

11:04.449 --> 11:05.230
Now you're through.

11:06.491 --> 11:12.537
Well, I don't know, but I've been told that lightning flashed, thunder rolled, and a cyclone hit the seat where I was set.

11:13.563 --> 11:20.890
They picked me up, the doctor said they had to tie me up in bed, cause I was goofy, crazy as a bat.

11:20.910 --> 11:26.997
Well, the moral of this story is, if you ain't young and full of fish, you better keep your feet down on the ground.

11:28.218 --> 11:34.184
Don't hit the saddle of a steed that lived for years on local weed, that is, if you still want to be around.

11:35.305 --> 11:42.152
He's a killer, he's a killer, killer dealer, killer dealer, he's a graveyard filler of the West.

11:42.689 --> 12:04.680
well i lost my hair my teeth came out my feet went flat and i got together but i finally made a big decision i'm all right now but i'm telling you with breaking broncos boy i'm through from here on out i'm watching it on television television television television television from here on out i'm watching television

12:07.765 --> 12:10.228
Well, will you look who's coming up the trail now?

12:10.468 --> 12:14.712
Big as life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all togged out in dungarees.

12:15.393 --> 12:17.796
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

12:17.816 --> 12:23.001
He's the popular candidate, the people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:23.021 --> 12:25.864
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:26.585 --> 12:28.387
Hello there, friends.

12:28.808 --> 12:35.815
I just want to put in a kind word for some fine supporters of mine, the farmers and ranchers of this country.

12:36.048 --> 12:42.115
They work mighty hard at their business of producing meat and other food for your table.

12:42.135 --> 12:45.598
And they always have to battle the weather to do their job.

12:45.959 --> 12:48.421
Too much rain or not enough rain.

12:48.882 --> 12:51.224
Wind storms or snow storms.

12:51.585 --> 12:54.748
Extreme heat or extreme cold.

12:54.768 --> 12:57.631
So please don't add to their problems.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.174
Be careful with fire outdoors.

13:00.855 --> 13:04.138
Well, I'll be seeing you.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.920
And there he goes down the trail.

13:06.507 --> 13:07.588
Thank you, Smokey.

13:08.970 --> 13:12.375
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:13.236 --> 13:15.839
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:16.801 --> 13:25.292
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:26.032 --> 13:37.147
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:37.668 --> 13:43.656
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest, woods, and range fires.

13:44.216 --> 13:48.462
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear

13:48.695 --> 14:06.703
Growlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before he starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear

14:06.683 --> 14:11.469
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:11.489 --> 14:15.514
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

14:15.914 --> 14:20.219
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:22.162 --> 14:31.513
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

14:31.533 --> 14:32.995
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

14:36.232 --> 14:36.878
Thank you.
