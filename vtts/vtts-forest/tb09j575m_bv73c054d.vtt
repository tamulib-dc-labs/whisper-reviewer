00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[Silence.]

00:10.000 --> 00:36.321
[Music.]

00:36.321 --> 00:38.105
Thank you, men.

00:38.145 --> 00:40.167
Thank you a whole lot there, friends.

00:40.187 --> 00:43.411
Here it is once again, time for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads.

00:43.431 --> 00:45.493
They're sitting here under the old pine tree.

00:46.254 --> 00:52.221
Just inhaling that good, fresh, clean, pure air that's sifted through them pine needles.

00:53.242 --> 00:55.725
Boy, you can just inhale barrels of it.

00:55.805 --> 00:58.948
I'm telling you, I believe each lung would hold three barrels.

00:58.968 --> 00:59.729
It's really fine.

00:59.869 --> 01:02.452
Why don't you come sit under the pine tree with us?

01:02.472 --> 01:03.433
We'd like to have you.

01:03.953 --> 01:05.038
Sure would.

01:05.058 --> 01:10.806
Here's Robert to play a tune to start things off with a really... Now, Robert, he gets the bell.

01:10.826 --> 01:12.515
Here it is, and it's Silver Bell.

01:12.535 --> 02:15.503
[Music.]

02:15.503 --> 02:18.387
Thank you, Robert.

02:18.407 --> 02:19.288
Thank you there, buddy.

02:19.368 --> 02:20.890
Thank you just a whole lot.

02:21.411 --> 02:24.055
Friends, this is the last program in this series.

02:25.236 --> 02:33.087
Yes, sir, and I just wanted to tell you that very few forests and woods and range fires are started from natural causes.

02:33.107 --> 02:37.753
I mean, they don't just, very few just happens, you know, such as lightning.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.540
Well, it figures about 10%.

02:42.807 --> 02:46.651
Woods and range fires get started from such causes as this.

02:46.671 --> 02:49.214
The rest is started from folks just like you and me.

02:50.396 --> 02:51.057
That's true.

02:52.418 --> 02:55.241
Now there's nothing spooky about this thing, friends.

02:55.261 --> 02:58.345
These forest and woods fires, how they get started and all that.

02:59.386 --> 03:01.749
It's just up to us two-legged critters.

03:01.769 --> 03:03.130
Men and women and children.

03:04.252 --> 03:07.656
We just get a little too careless, that's all, with fire.

03:08.577 --> 03:09.658
In and near the woods.

03:09.908 --> 03:14.932
dry grass and all that sort of stuff, get careless, bang, there goes another forest fire.

03:14.952 --> 03:16.113
That's the way it happens, friend.

03:16.474 --> 03:35.590
Killing little trees, wildlife, damaging the big trees, so insects and diseases can get in, putting ashes in the streams, so fish die, destroying the beauty of the woods, the forest, wrecking outdoor picnic spots, campground, making the soil pour, washing it off, leading to erosion and floods.

03:37.212 --> 03:38.633
Friends, I tell you, forests,

03:38.917 --> 03:41.901
And woods fires are bad medicine.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.963
It's really bad medicine.

03:43.983 --> 03:46.847
And you know what one of the principal causes of all this is?

03:48.229 --> 03:49.711
It's careless smokers.

03:49.991 --> 03:51.012
Yes, that's one of them.

03:51.553 --> 03:52.514
It's just carelessness.

03:52.554 --> 03:53.876
That's the main thing.

03:54.096 --> 03:54.917
Careless smokers.

03:55.638 --> 04:01.085
The guy or gal who's careless with his matches, tossing them away when they're still lit, still burning.

04:01.506 --> 04:02.787
Same goes with cigarettes.

04:04.129 --> 04:04.890
Pipe ashes.

04:05.731 --> 04:07.433
Be careful with these smokes, friends.

04:07.653 --> 04:08.574
Be careful with them.

04:08.874 --> 04:12.177
I don't believe there's a car manufactured that they haven't got an ashtray in it.

04:12.257 --> 04:13.759
Nice, convenient ashtray.

04:14.279 --> 04:16.802
You can just put your match over in the ashtray.

04:16.822 --> 04:17.943
It's got a cigarette lighter.

04:18.624 --> 04:20.205
Light your cigarette with a lighter.

04:20.225 --> 04:22.127
When you get through with it, put it in the ashtray.

04:22.627 --> 04:23.188
It's easy.

04:24.309 --> 04:25.430
Nothing to it.

04:25.450 --> 04:32.517
Might save, that very cigarette that you put in the ashtray might save thousands of dollars worth of little young timber.

04:32.937 --> 04:33.578
Wildlife.

04:34.790 --> 04:35.571
Nothing to it.

04:35.591 --> 04:36.472
It's easy, friends.

04:36.492 --> 04:38.434
You just got to think of these things.

04:38.615 --> 04:39.155
Think of it.

04:39.195 --> 04:39.736
That's all.

04:40.757 --> 04:46.284
I wish all of you would just be friends enough to me to be just a little more careful.

04:46.945 --> 04:47.605
Won't you do that?

04:47.906 --> 04:50.489
Here's the next tune, and Slim's going to sing it.

04:50.509 --> 04:51.730
This is really a good one.

04:52.211 --> 04:53.292
It really is.

04:53.312 --> 04:55.735
Here it is, Southern Hospitality.

04:59.883 --> 05:08.521
Well, I'm just a lad from way down south where that southern cooking just melts in your mouth.

05:08.561 --> 05:09.824
Take me back south.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.429
That's where I want to be.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.453
I hear you talking, son.

05:14.473 --> 05:20.085
Where they give you that southern, southern hospitality.

05:20.065 --> 05:23.750
Well, I had a little gal, she lived across the street.

05:24.110 --> 05:27.375
Every time she cooked, she'd holler, come on and eat.

05:27.395 --> 05:31.881
But take me back south, that's where I want to be.

05:33.363 --> 05:39.771
Where they give you that southern, southern hospitality.

05:39.791 --> 05:57.663
[Music.]

05:57.663 --> 06:01.449
Well, you have a little party, last till four.

06:01.690 --> 06:04.655
Policeman comes a-knocking on your front door.

06:05.035 --> 06:09.823
Invite him in and set him right down and holler in the back.

06:09.843 --> 06:11.246
Hey, bring another round.

06:11.486 --> 06:12.909
Well, take me back south.

06:13.249 --> 06:15.553
That's where I want to be.

06:17.339 --> 06:41.440
where they give you that southern southern hospitality. Well you sleep all day and you ramble all night. 
Go to church on Sunday and tell the parson you right. But take me back south. That's where I want to be. 
Where they give you that southern southern hospitality.

06:42.449 --> 06:46.493
Well, you stay out all night and you paint the town.

06:46.513 --> 06:49.936
You come home and find your chicken fried a golden brown.

06:49.956 --> 06:51.177
Take me back south.

06:51.537 --> 06:55.781
That's where I want to be.

06:55.801 --> 07:01.567
Well, they give you that southern, southern hospitality.

07:04.349 --> 07:05.610
Thank you, Slim.

07:05.630 --> 07:07.532
Thank you a lot there, honey boy.

07:07.852 --> 07:10.735
That's money far and carrying on there.

07:11.322 --> 07:15.228
I'd just like to call on you personally.

07:15.248 --> 07:24.361
I wish it was so that I could stand right there and look you right in the eye and ask you as man to man, woman to woman, child to child.

07:24.381 --> 07:28.167
Now, all you little rabbit twisters out there, you can do your part.

07:28.187 --> 07:31.813
Yes, sir, you can do just as much as Mom and Dad.

07:31.833 --> 07:38.462
You can help me and Smokey Bear keep down some of these woods and forests and range fires.

07:38.883 --> 07:40.165
Yes, sir, you can really help.

07:40.415 --> 07:41.937
You can help a lot.

07:41.957 --> 07:42.938
And I'm asking you.

07:43.318 --> 07:43.658
Yes, sir.

07:43.738 --> 07:48.503
I'm asking you to help me keep down these forests and woods forests.

07:48.523 --> 07:49.904
There's no sense in it.

07:49.925 --> 07:50.946
It costs all of us.

07:51.526 --> 07:55.951
And you little fellas out there, after you grow up, you're going to want to build you a house.

07:55.971 --> 07:57.112
Going to want to build you a house.

07:57.132 --> 07:58.613
You've got to have a house to live in.

07:59.494 --> 08:03.398
And you can't ever tell the very trees that you might help save.

08:03.999 --> 08:06.781
They may be the very trees that you'll use to build your house.

08:07.182 --> 08:07.903
You can't tell.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.244
You don't never know.

08:10.025 --> 08:10.405
So,

08:11.009 --> 08:13.312
help me do these things, won't you?

08:13.412 --> 08:15.775
I'm just asking you to do that.

08:15.795 --> 08:21.563
Now, whenever you're out in the woods, you've got to build a fire, maybe to roast weenies.

08:21.583 --> 08:26.970
A lot of you young people out there, you go on the weenie roast, you go out in the woods to have a good time.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.953
And we want you to have a good time.

08:29.193 --> 08:33.699
And if there's anything we can do to help you have a good time, we're willing to do just that.

08:33.719 --> 08:36.443
But be careful with your fire, where you're going to

08:36.676 --> 09:04.945
roast your weenies. Rake the leaves back. Be sure it's cleaned off, a good clean space where that fire can't 
possibly get started there. And then when you get through with your weenie roast, it only takes a minute. 
All of you can just pitch in and and have that fire dead out in seconds. It only takes just a second or two. 
Everybody pitch in and put out this weenie roast fire. Then everything is taken care of and you've really 
done your part. Then you take you fellas that go out hunting.

09:06.038 --> 09:19.137
Well, hunting season opens different times at different places and all, and you go out hunting, you're creeping 
along through the woods looking for a rabbit or a squirrel or something, and you're smoking a cigarette.

09:20.218 --> 09:34.999
You don't think, and you'll flip that cigarette down and go on, that cigarette is lit, and maybe after you've 
finished your hunt and gone home, why, that cigarette will revive there, and your leaves are smoldering, and it'll blaze up and burn off acres and acres of land.

09:35.502 --> 09:38.404
Next time you want to go hunting out there, you can't.

09:38.424 --> 09:40.466
Who in the world wants to hunt in burnt over woods?

09:40.486 --> 09:42.488
There's nothing to hunt there.

09:42.508 --> 09:46.631
Why, that's just like going and fishing in a dry creek somewhere.

09:46.651 --> 09:49.994
Wouldn't you look pretty sitting on the creek bank where there wasn't any water fishing?

09:50.355 --> 09:53.697
Well, that's the same thing as going down through the burnt over woods.

09:53.717 --> 09:56.560
And it's up to you fellas out there to help me get this thing started.

09:57.761 --> 09:59.903
So I'm just appealing to all of you, friends.

10:00.463 --> 10:01.824
Appealing to every one of you.

10:01.844 --> 10:03.406
You can do your part.

10:03.426 --> 10:05.087
You might not realize it right now.

10:05.455 --> 10:08.078
But there's never a time in which you can't do your part.

10:08.999 --> 10:12.343
So you help me keep these things down, friends.

10:12.363 --> 10:13.885
Chuck says, just be careful.

10:14.286 --> 10:15.727
Just be careful always.

10:15.907 --> 10:16.909
Won't you do that for me?

10:17.329 --> 10:18.250
Here's another tune.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.153
Another tune here.

10:20.533 --> 10:21.955
This is really another good one.

10:22.676 --> 10:25.179
Actually, we got some hot ones on today.

10:25.219 --> 10:28.122
Here's one called, let's see, it features a steel man, though.

10:28.222 --> 10:30.124
I wanted to tell you that, Mr. Tyler.

10:30.765 --> 10:32.307
Mr. Tyler, that is, Charlie Tyler.

10:32.422 --> 10:36.981
He's going to do just a dab, dab, and a half, two dabs of Oklahoma Storm.

10:36.981 --> 11:40.656
[Music.]

11:40.656 --> 11:43.102
Well, thank you there, buddy.

11:43.122 --> 11:43.943
Well, there it is.

11:43.963 --> 11:46.447
You know, that kind of whooped me down to a frass.

11:46.467 --> 11:57.162
Friends, instead of the usual thought for the day, on this last program of this series, I'm going to give that conservation pledge that I took a while back.

11:58.023 --> 12:00.547
Now, you might say it's a thought for the year.

12:01.708 --> 12:02.790
In fact, for every year.

12:04.212 --> 12:07.937
In this wonderful country of ours here,

12:08.626 --> 12:15.836
Now, I sure hope that you'll think about this pledge and take it yourself, in your heart, and in your mind.

12:16.977 --> 12:17.438
Here it is.

12:18.599 --> 12:33.860
I give my pledge as an American to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country, its soil and minerals, its forests, waters, and wildlife.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.342
Well, friends, there it is.

12:41.077 --> 12:55.275
Well, friends, this is the last program in this series, and we hope to be back with you soon.

12:56.597 --> 12:59.581
When we get together again, you'll find us.

12:59.601 --> 13:09.453
Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads are sitting here under the old big pine tree, waiting, just waiting for you to come back up the trail.

13:09.473 --> 13:10.695
Now, friends, don't forget

13:11.452 --> 13:23.569
that we've been brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:24.771 --> 13:30.872
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest, woods, and range fires.

13:30.872 --> 14:07.000
[Music.]
