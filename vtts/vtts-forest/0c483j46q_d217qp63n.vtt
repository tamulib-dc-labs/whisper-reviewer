00:00.000 --> 00:11.573
[Silence.]

00:11.573 --> 00:35.317
[Music.]

00:35.317 --> 00:35.999
All right.

00:36.019 --> 00:36.742
Sold out, Doc.

00:36.762 --> 00:37.925
Another soul made happy.

00:37.965 --> 00:38.628
Howdy, friends.

00:38.648 --> 00:39.250
How are y'all?

00:39.330 --> 00:39.571
Yes, sir.

00:39.591 --> 00:40.473
You guessed it again.

00:40.494 --> 00:48.178
It's your old woods rider himself, Jelly Elliot, and all the Knotheads gathered up here under the old pine tree coming your way for the next few minutes.

00:48.496 --> 00:55.468
And we do hope that you'll drag up a chair and relax there and probably enjoy some of these old tunes that we have picked out for you.

00:56.129 --> 00:57.972
And here we go with the first one.

00:57.992 --> 00:58.994
And it features Bob.

00:59.234 --> 01:01.819
Bob Henderson with his strata-potato fiddle.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.323
And I told you how Bob got this fiddle.

01:04.363 --> 01:08.170
And here he is with one that he does a right smart job on.

01:08.190 --> 01:11.496
It's a little thing called Uncle Penn.

01:11.516 --> 01:11.736
Uncle Penn.

01:11.736 --> 02:09.949
[Music.]

02:09.949 --> 02:10.783
I didn't like that a bit.

02:10.823 --> 02:12.305
You cut it too short there, Bob.

02:12.345 --> 02:15.869
That was mighty fine fiddling, and I know most of the old-timers out there.

02:15.909 --> 02:17.931
In fact, I believe all of them enjoyed that.

02:18.312 --> 02:18.952
Uncle Penn.

02:20.795 --> 02:25.360
Friends, I wanted to talk to you just a little dab-dab and a half, two dabs here about the forestry boys.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.943
Now, whether they're your local foresters,

02:27.974 --> 02:32.955
they work with the state or uncle sam it don't make any difference they're all human beings

02:33.425 --> 02:44.257
And with special training, they've all got special training, special ability to do the job of keeping the forest green and growing and safe from fire.

02:44.738 --> 02:52.867
They're really doing one of the most important jobs there is in the United States, and that is keeping fire out of the woods.

02:52.887 --> 03:01.457
They're trying to keep fire out of the woods, but still there's some people that'll be careless with their matches and cigarettes and let the fire get out.

03:01.437 --> 03:04.501
And that causes these boys to have to work night and day.

03:05.582 --> 03:10.429
And, friends, I've got an interest in this thing, and I know most of you out there listening have.

03:10.769 --> 03:12.231
In fact, all of you have.

03:12.992 --> 03:14.654
You just get careless, that's all.

03:14.674 --> 03:15.836
That's the only thing about it.

03:16.356 --> 03:19.681
And I want you to look on to these boys as just one of you.

03:19.701 --> 03:23.125
I've known of cases where some of the boys would have on maybe a necktie.

03:23.678 --> 03:32.153
And some local guy that lived out there in the woods somewhere would poke fun at him just because he had on a necktie.

03:32.533 --> 03:37.782
Well, that don't make any difference whether he's got on a necktie or hip boots and red pajamas.

03:37.822 --> 03:39.646
That still don't make any difference.

03:39.666 --> 03:40.808
He's still a human being.

03:40.868 --> 03:42.210
He has special training.

03:42.190 --> 03:44.232
to do this firefighting job.

03:44.252 --> 03:54.222
As I told you in a past program that I have been on cases, been on fires where a man called himself back firing and he burnt off the whole country.

03:54.622 --> 03:57.465
Well, these boys have been taught different.

03:57.485 --> 04:02.911
They know where and when and how to set these fires and they need your help.

04:02.931 --> 04:08.316
It's just like being a game warden or being a traffic cop or being any

04:08.650 --> 04:12.356
officer, I'd say, they can't do the job by themselves.

04:13.298 --> 04:15.962
You've got to cooperate with them.

04:17.104 --> 04:19.608
Now, I've got some good examples.

04:20.209 --> 04:25.798
Some of the high schools are farming local forest protection crews.

04:25.818 --> 04:30.085
They're trying to help prevent these forest fires, woods fires.

04:30.352 --> 04:46.915
Even if more folks would just help mop up and patrol a burned area where the fire's already burned after the fire crews have got the fire controlled, if more people would take an interest in it and try to keep it from jumping the fire lines and getting out again, friends, that would help a lot.

04:46.975 --> 04:49.238
You just don't realize how much it would help.

04:49.218 --> 04:57.108
When there's been a long drought, dry season, no rain and all that, and they're out fighting fire night and day, you just don't know.

04:57.128 --> 04:59.932
If you'd follow these boys around a while, then you'd know.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.734
That's when they need your help.

05:02.155 --> 05:03.977
That's when they need it most.

05:03.997 --> 05:06.420
And they need a helping hand.

05:07.502 --> 05:15.512
And really, really understanding of a tough job that they have to do, it's all a matter of understanding, really, friends.

05:16.167 --> 05:18.073
And I got a story about that.

05:18.093 --> 05:19.879
But first, here's the next tune.

05:19.899 --> 05:21.645
And I believe Charlie's going to sing it.

05:22.187 --> 05:24.675
It's a little thing called the Tennessee Saturday Night.

05:31.422 --> 05:52.519
Well listen while I tell you about a place I know Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines Civilized people live there alright But they all go native on a Saturday night

06:00.143 --> 06:29.442
The music is a fiddle and a crack guitar They get the kicks from an old fruit jar They do the boogie to an old square dance The woods are full of couple looking for romance Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

06:29.442 --> 06:48.355
[Music.]

06:48.355 --> 06:51.281
When they get together, there's a lot of fun.

06:51.562 --> 06:54.508
They all know the other fella packs a gun.

06:55.049 --> 06:57.535
Everybody does his best to act just right.

06:57.715 --> 07:00.962
Cause there's gonna be a funeral if they start a fight.

07:01.202 --> 07:04.008
They struggle and they shuffle till we're all daylight.

07:04.028 --> 07:06.634
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday.

07:06.634 --> 07:26.172 
[Music.]

07:26.172 --> 07:48.653
Now you've heard my story about a place I know down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows Hidden from the world in a bunch of fines 
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines Civilized people live there, all right But they all go native on a Saturday night Thank you, Charlie, thank you.

07:49.696 --> 07:54.541
Friends, I wanted to tell you about a little incident that happened to me here not too long ago.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.764
The boys had been fighting fire there night and day.

07:58.425 --> 08:00.407
And I do mean night and day.

08:00.427 --> 08:02.790
When night comes, that don't mean a thing to these boys.

08:02.990 --> 08:06.514
As long as the fire's going, they got to keep going too.

08:06.534 --> 08:10.518
So they needed food and they needed water and all that sort of stuff.

08:10.558 --> 08:19.247
So me and one of the fire bosses run up to the Crossroads Country Store there to get something to eat for these boys and some water and stuff.

08:19.885 --> 08:46.753
Well, we got up to the Crossroads store and had the radio going there full blast, so I stayed with the radio to see if a message come in for us, 
and he went in the store to buy the stuff that we needed, something to eat and all that sort of stuff, one of them hardware lunches, you know, 
sardines and crackers and stuff, and there was several fellas around, there's right there at the Crossroads, and there were several fellas standing around, and

08:46.953 --> 08:49.077
And these guys began to gather around.

08:49.137 --> 08:54.647
First one come over there and leaned over in the door, and he was listening, and then another, and another.

08:54.687 --> 08:58.113
And first thing you know, they was all over there listening to this radio.

08:58.574 --> 09:04.685
Well, it was interesting because these fellows had never heard of, much less heard.

09:05.025 --> 09:06.788
They didn't know such a thing existed.

09:07.149 --> 09:10.615
They didn't have any idea that the forestry boys had...

09:10.595 --> 09:33.598
occasions of this kind now they knew the fire was raging because they could see the smoke and they all gathered up around the car yes sir it was a lot of fun to them local people until the fire patrol plane came over and it was right over the fire circling we could see the plane and this is what they heard the pilot say air patrol plane number three to fire dispatcher

09:34.118 --> 09:36.461
Tom, you've got to get more men out on this fire.

09:36.722 --> 09:40.887
She's really rolling and the wind's changed and driving the fire right into the game preserve.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.552
On the north side, there's a break over into that logging area.

09:44.933 --> 09:47.176
Those logs are still on the ground.

09:47.196 --> 09:50.701
I tell you, Tom, we're not going to lick this fire with the number of men on it now.

09:51.101 --> 09:53.605
You've just got to get more men in on it.

09:53.625 --> 09:57.670
Well, sir, you never saw such a change come over people's face in your life.

09:58.651 --> 10:00.514
Really, friends, I wish you could have seen it.

10:01.085 --> 10:07.034
Now, you're talking about a bunch of faces that got solemn and got down to business all of a sudden.

10:07.054 --> 10:07.876
These fellows did.

10:07.936 --> 10:12.623
I couldn't help but notice I was watching all of them because I'm really interested in this thing.

10:13.024 --> 10:14.025
There was no joking.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.389
There was nothing said.

10:16.529 --> 10:20.335
In fact, everybody just quieted down there all of a sudden.

10:20.355 --> 10:24.662
And for the first time, these men knew what forest fires was all about.

10:25.452 --> 10:28.541
It was their game that these boys was protecting.

10:28.762 --> 10:33.256
It was their game that was in danger, and it was their jobs that could be lost.

10:33.276 --> 10:36.947
And when the fireballs came out of the store, friend, what do you think he said?

10:37.383 --> 10:44.932
He found a bunch of these men, in fact, all of them, was loaded up in the back of the truck, and they was ready to go with us right back to the fire.

10:44.952 --> 10:48.376
They wanted to go out and help, and that's exactly what they done.

10:48.396 --> 10:51.120
And that's what I call real cooperation.

10:51.460 --> 10:56.566
Now, here we go with the next tune, and I believe it features Herman on his little guitar here.

10:56.686 --> 11:04.936
Ethiopian, steam-heated, butane-burning steel guitar with a little dab-dab and half two dabs of the panhandle rag.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.339
On board, ballpoint sound.

11:08.197 --> 11:35.807
Well, what's the matter with your toy?

11:44.056 --> 11:50.491
I must go, son.

11:50.832 --> 12:00.073
I must stop them.

12:21.670 --> 12:22.692
Well, thank you, Herman.

12:22.732 --> 12:23.333
Thank you a lot.

12:23.353 --> 12:25.155
That was very nicely done there, my boy.

12:25.756 --> 12:26.978
Not near as good as I could have done.

12:27.339 --> 12:28.080
Friends, we've got to go.

12:28.100 --> 12:28.981
We've run out of time.

12:29.001 --> 12:34.310
But before we go, here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you, and I do hope you'll keep it in mind.

12:35.331 --> 12:40.019
The forester has a mighty tough job, fighting fire, protecting your land.

12:40.820 --> 12:46.108
So please keep in mind that oftentimes he would sure love your helping hand.

12:46.460 --> 13:02.157
Friends, we've sure enjoyed this little visit here with you under the old pine tree.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.803
and we do hope that you've enjoyed it too.

13:04.823 --> 13:06.586
We'll be coming your way again soon.

13:07.066 --> 13:10.451
Listen to the local announcer and he'll let you know the exact date and time.

13:11.112 --> 13:24.510
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:24.530 --> 13:28.195
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fire.

13:28.195 --> 13:55.043
[Music.]
