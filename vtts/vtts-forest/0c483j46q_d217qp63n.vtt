. . . . . .

00:35.317 --> 00:35.999
All right. Sold out, Doc. Another soul made happy. Howdy, friends. How are y'all? Yes, sir. You guessed it again. It's 
your old woods rider himself, Jelly Elliot, and all the knotheads gathered up here under the old pine tree coming your

00:40.494 --> 00:48.178
way for the next few minutes. And we do hope that you'll drag up a chair and relax there and probably enjoy some of these old 
tunes that we have picked out for you. And here we go with the first one. And it features Bob. Bob Henderson with his

00:59.234 --> 01:01.819
strata-potato fiddle. And I told you how Bob got this fiddle. And here he is with one that he does a right smart job on. It's 
a little thing called Uncle Penn. Uncle Penn.

01:15.293 --> 01:15.593
. . . . . . .

01:58.949 --> 02:10.783
I

01:58.949 --> 02:10.783
didn't like that a bit. You cut it too short there, Bob. That was mighty fine fiddling, and I know most of the old-timers 
out there. In fact, I believe all of them enjoyed that. Uncle Penn. Friends, I wanted to talk to you just a little dab-dab

02:20.795 --> 02:25.360
and a half, two dabs here about the forestry boys. Now, whether they're your local foresters, they work with the state or 
uncle sam it don't make any difference they're all human beings And with special training, they've all got special

02:33.425 --> 02:44.257
training, special ability to do the job of keeping the forest green and growing and safe from fire. They're really doing 
one of the most important jobs there is in the United States, and that is keeping fire out of the woods. They're trying to

02:52.887 --> 03:01.457
keep fire out of the woods, but still there's some people that'll be careless with their matches and cigarettes and let 
the fire get out. And that causes these boys to have to work night and day. And, friends, I've got an interest in this

03:05.582 --> 03:10.429
thing, and I know most of you out there listening have. In fact, all of you have. You just get careless, that's all. That's 
the only thing about it. And I want you to look on to these boys as just one of you. I've known of cases where some of the boys

03:19.701 --> 03:23.125
would have on maybe a necktie. And some local guy that lived out there in the woods somewhere would poke fun at him just 
because he had on a necktie. Well, that don't make any difference whether he's got on a necktie or hip boots and red

03:32.533 --> 03:37.782
pajamas. That still don't make any difference. He's still a human being. He has special training. to do this 
firefighting job. As I told you in a past program that I have been on cases, been on fires where a man called himself back

03:44.252 --> 03:54.222
firing and he burnt off the whole country. Well, these boys have been taught different. They know where and when and how 
to set these fires and they need your help. It's just like being a game warden or being a traffic cop or being any officer,

04:08.650 --> 04:12.356
I'd say, they can't do the job by themselves. You've got to cooperate with them. Now, I've got some good examples. Some of 
the high schools are farming local forest protection crews. They're trying to help prevent these forest fires, woods

04:25.818 --> 04:30.085
fires. Even if more folks would just help mop up and patrol a burned area where the fire's already burned after the fire 
crews have got the fire controlled, if more people would take an interest in it and try to keep it from jumping the fire

04:30.352 --> 04:46.915
lines and getting out again, friends, that would help a lot. You just don't realize how much it would help. When there's 
been a long drought, dry season, no rain and all that, and they're out fighting fire night and day, you just don't know. If

04:57.128 --> 04:59.932
you'd follow these boys around a while, then you'd know. That's when they need your help. That's when they need it most. 
And they need a helping hand. And really, really understanding of a tough job that they have to do, it's all a matter of

05:07.502 --> 05:15.512
understanding, really, friends. And I got a story about that. But first, here's the next tune. And I believe Charlie's 
going to sing it. It's a little thing called the Tennessee Saturday Night.

05:31.422 --> 05:52.519
Well listen while I tell you about a place I know Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows Hidden from the world in a 
bunch of pines Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines Civilized people live there alright But they all go

05:31.422 --> 05:52.519
native on a Saturday night

06:00.143 --> 06:29.442
The

06:00.143 --> 06:29.442
music is a fiddle and a crack guitar They get the kicks from an old fruit jar They do the boogie to an old square dance The 
woods are full of couple looking for romance Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light Yes, they all go native on

06:00.143 --> 06:29.442
a Saturday night

06:36.560 --> 06:40.242
.

06:48.355 --> 06:51.281
When they get together, there's a lot of fun. They all know the other fella packs a gun. Everybody does his best to act just 
right. Cause there's gonna be a funeral if they start a fight. They struggle and they shuffle till we're all daylight.

07:04.028 --> 07:06.634
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday.

07:10.782 --> 07:11.103
. .

07:26.172 --> 07:48.653
Now you've heard my story about a place I know Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows Hidden from the world in a bunch 
of fines Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines Civilized people live there, all right But they all go

07:26.172 --> 07:48.653
native on a Saturday night Thank you, Charlie, thank you. Friends, I wanted to tell you about a little incident that 
happened to me here not too long ago. The boys had been fighting fire there night and day. And I do mean night and day. When

08:00.427 --> 08:02.790
night comes, that don't mean a thing to these boys. As long as the fire's going, they got to keep going too. So they needed 
food and they needed water and all that sort of stuff. So me and one of the fire bosses run up to the Crossroads Country

08:10.558 --> 08:19.247
Store there to get something to eat for these boys and some water and stuff. Well, we got up to the Crossroads store and had 
the radio going there full blast, so I stayed with the radio to see if a message come in for us, and he went in the store to buy

08:19.885 --> 08:46.753
the stuff that we needed, something to eat and all that sort of stuff, one of them hardware lunches, you know, sardines 
and crackers and stuff, and there was several fellas around, there's right there at the Crossroads, and there were

08:19.885 --> 08:46.753
several fellas standing around, and And these guys began to gather around. First one come over there and leaned over in 
the door, and he was listening, and then another, and another. And first thing you know, they was all over there

08:54.687 --> 08:58.113
listening to this radio. Well, it was interesting because these fellows had never heard of, much less heard. They 
didn't know such a thing existed. They didn't have any idea that the forestry boys had... occasions of this kind now they

09:10.595 --> 09:33.598
knew the fire was raging because they could see the smoke and they all gathered up around the car yes sir it was a lot of fun 
to them local people until the fire patrol plane came over and it was right over the fire circling we could see the plane

09:10.595 --> 09:33.598
and this is what they heard the pilot say air patrol plane number three to fire dispatcher Tom, you've got to get more men 
out on this fire. She's really rolling and the wind's changed and driving the fire right into the game preserve. On the

09:41.849 --> 09:44.552
north side, there's a break over into that logging area. Those logs are still on the ground. I tell you, Tom, we're not 
going to lick this fire with the number of men on it now. You've just got to get more men in on it. Well, sir, you never saw

09:53.625 --> 09:57.670
such a change come over people's face in your life. Really, friends, I wish you could have seen it. Now, you're talking 
about a bunch of faces that got solemn and got down to business all of a sudden. These fellows did. I couldn't help but

10:07.936 --> 10:12.623
notice I was watching all of them because I'm really interested in this thing. There was no joking. There was nothing 
said. In fact, everybody just quieted down there all of a sudden. And for the first time, these men knew what forest fires

10:20.355 --> 10:24.662
was all about. It was their game that these boys was protecting. It was their game that was in danger, and it was their jobs 
that could be lost. And when the fireballs came out of the store, friend, what do you think he said? He found a bunch of

10:37.383 --> 10:44.932
these men, in fact, all of them, was loaded up in the back of the truck, and they was ready to go with us right back to the 
fire. They wanted to go out and help, and that's exactly what they done. And that's what I call real cooperation. Now,

10:51.460 --> 10:56.566
here we go with the next tune, and I believe it features Herman on his little guitar here. Ethiopian, steam-heated, 
butane-burning steel guitar with a little dab-dab and half two dabs of the panhandle rag. On board, ballpoint sound.

11:08.197 --> 11:35.807
Well, what's

11:08.197 --> 11:35.807
the matter with your toy?

11:44.056 --> 11:50.491
I must go, son. I must stop them.

12:21.670 --> 12:22.692
Well, thank you, Herman. Thank you a lot. That was very nicely done there, my boy. Not near as good as I could have done. 
Friends, we've got to go. We've run out of time. But before we go, here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with

12:29.001 --> 12:34.310
you, and I do hope you'll keep it in mind. The forester has a mighty tough job, fighting fire, protecting your land. So 
please keep in mind that oftentimes he would sure love your helping hand. Friends,

12:46.460 --> 13:02.157
we've sure enjoyed this little visit here with you under the old pine tree. and we do hope that you've enjoyed it too. 
We'll be coming your way again soon. Listen to the local announcer and he'll let you know the exact date and time.

13:11.112 --> 13:24.510
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your 
own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening

13:11.112 --> 13:24.510
to. Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fire.

13:31.043 --> 13:32.185
