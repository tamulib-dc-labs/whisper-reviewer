00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
[Silence.]

00:13.261 --> 00:20.993
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:21.413 --> 00:23.136
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:23.176 --> 00:24.959
That was how he got his name.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.461
Hi there, friends.

00:26.481 --> 00:28.424
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:29.025 --> 00:30.828
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:31.609 --> 00:36.637
Now, just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors.

00:36.977 --> 00:38.339
The sons of the pioneers.

00:39.561 --> 00:42.205
Looks like the boys are getting ready for chow over there.

00:42.792 --> 00:43.893
Let's listen in.

00:43.913 --> 00:47.476
Well, Shug, what's for supper?

00:47.516 --> 00:48.497
Hi, fellas, hi.

00:48.758 --> 00:49.418
What's for supper?

00:50.239 --> 00:51.380
I'm glad you asked me that.

00:51.420 --> 00:52.181
I like you boys.

00:52.241 --> 00:53.062
I like you fine.

00:53.582 --> 01:03.631
I've decided to fix for you a great big old pan of round, brown, hot, crunchy, mellow biscuits.

01:04.132 --> 01:07.335
Biscuits?

01:07.355 --> 01:11.719
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

01:13.471 --> 01:17.016
Why, I've cooked biscuits all of my life.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.898
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

01:18.918 --> 01:21.883
I've cooked for the devil and the devil's wife.

01:21.903 --> 01:23.925
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

01:23.945 --> 01:25.888
I've cooked for old Paul Bunyan's crew.

01:25.908 --> 01:30.094
When I run short of flour, just use glue, but they're all dead, so I'll cook them for you.

01:30.154 --> 01:33.458
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

01:33.478 --> 01:36.863
Biscuits for breakfast, biscuits for dinner, biscuits for supper, too.

01:37.062 --> 01:39.204
And a biscuit dream most every night.

01:40.466 --> 01:41.787
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.391
Well, I can make biscuits of every kind.

01:45.411 --> 01:46.853
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

01:47.414 --> 01:49.316
I make them out of any old thing I find.

01:50.417 --> 01:52.619
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

01:52.639 --> 01:54.502
Biscuit pudding and biscuit stew.

01:54.602 --> 01:56.604
Great big biscuits and little ones, too.

01:56.624 --> 01:59.948
And biscuits you can't even chew.

01:59.968 --> 02:01.269
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.692
When I go to the oven to see if they're done.

02:04.933 --> 02:06.495
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

02:06.661 --> 02:08.703
Well, I opened up the door, then I pulled my gun.

02:09.945 --> 02:11.787
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

02:11.807 --> 02:13.989
Then a fan three shot with a crack, crack, crack.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.111
And with the biscuit smile, the slugs bounce back.

02:16.132 --> 02:17.153
They're done to a turn.

02:17.173 --> 02:18.254
What a tasty snack.

02:19.675 --> 02:21.598
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

02:21.618 --> 02:25.202
Biscuits for breakfast, biscuits for dinner, biscuits for supper, too.

02:25.442 --> 02:27.424
And the biscuit dream most every night.

02:28.445 --> 02:30.087
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

02:30.370 --> 02:33.675
We're going to have biscuits every day.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.177
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

02:35.737 --> 02:37.540
I'll cook them up ahead and I'll stack them away.

02:38.862 --> 02:40.304
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

02:40.684 --> 02:42.887
There were biscuits here and biscuits there.

02:43.028 --> 02:44.770
Biscuits crawling through your hair.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.993
There'll be biscuits, biscuits everywhere.

02:48.375 --> 02:50.097
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

02:50.117 --> 02:52.100
Well, how about a nice big juicy steak?

02:52.861 --> 02:53.442
Oh...

02:56.543 --> 02:58.846
With mushroom gravy and a devil's food cake?

02:58.986 --> 03:03.591
Oh...

03:03.611 --> 03:05.554
All the trimming's got it.

03:05.574 --> 03:08.056
Just food galore.

03:08.337 --> 03:09.138
A glass of wine.

03:09.178 --> 03:09.738
Sure.

03:09.758 --> 03:10.780
Maybe three or four.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.121
I like it.

03:12.141 --> 03:13.923
Well, you're going to get biscuit.

03:14.304 --> 03:15.285
Now, don't get sore.

03:15.745 --> 03:22.213
Oh, we got the biscuit blues.

03:26.615 --> 03:30.258
Sounds like those biscuits would give anyone the blues.

03:30.278 --> 03:33.801
But seriously, folks, today I'd like to talk about matches.

03:34.702 --> 03:35.482
Lighted matches.

03:36.844 --> 03:41.087
Did you ever see the results of carelessness with matches?

03:41.107 --> 03:41.487
I did.

03:42.248 --> 03:43.349
Just a short time back.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.633
Someone had tossed a lighted match in the dry leaves and needles near the woods.

03:50.255 --> 03:56.520
What I remember most was what was left of a little four-room house that stood at the other edge of the woods.

03:57.631 --> 04:02.676
All that was left were some of the metal fixtures like a bed frame and hot water tank.

04:03.657 --> 04:07.762
And there was a little kitten with scorched fur sitting on the charred house beam.

04:09.223 --> 04:10.645
Sure gave me an awful feeling.

04:12.327 --> 04:16.431
A lot of love and hard work go into the building of any home.

04:17.472 --> 04:22.257
Take the fellow who lived in the little old sod shanty.

04:22.277 --> 04:26.642
I am looking rather seedy now while holding down my claim.

04:27.196 --> 04:31.212
And my vittles are not always of the best.

04:31.232 --> 04:36.092
And the mice play shyly round me as I nestle down to rest.

04:36.511 --> 05:05.218
In my little old sod shanty in the west. Oh, the hinges are of leather and the windows have no glass, while the board roof lets the howling blizzards in 
And I hear the hungry coyote as he slinks up through the grass round my little old sod shanty on my claim. Yet I rather like the novelty of living in this 
way though my bill of fare is always rather tame

05:05.857 --> 05:30.261
But I'm happy as a clam on this land of Uncle Sam in my little old sod shanty on my claim. Well the hinges are of leather and the windows have no glass 
While the board roof lets the howlin' blizzards in And I hear the hungry coyote as he slinks up through the grass round my little old sod shanty on my claim.

05:30.562 --> 05:34.545
Round my little old sod shanty on my claim.

05:34.565 --> 05:39.810
Round my little old sod shanty on my claim.

05:42.252 --> 05:49.759
Now, we were talking about matches and how, when folks are careless with them, they can start a roaring forest fire.

05:49.779 --> 05:53.181
I guess you've heard Smokey Bear say, break your matches in two.

05:54.763 --> 05:59.607
This is a very simple, though mighty important, rule for preventing forest fires.

06:00.262 --> 06:01.343
Do you know what's back of it?

06:02.084 --> 06:11.273
The idea, of course, is that when you break a match into two pieces, or in the case of a book match, you bend it in two, you're going to be pretty sure that the match is out.

06:12.054 --> 06:13.275
Otherwise, you'll burn yourself.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.659
Would you look at Lloyd Pearman over there?

06:17.480 --> 06:18.601
Why that frown, fella?

06:19.121 --> 06:20.963
You know, I was just sitting here thinking.

06:20.983 --> 06:27.450
Now, you take the average man, all he wants, really, is the opportunity to work, to be healthy and happy.

06:28.055 --> 06:35.046
Doesn't matter who he is, whether he's a lumberjack, a factory worker, a cowboy like the one we're going to be singing about in a minute.

06:35.066 --> 06:41.216
The point is that if it was up to the good Lord above, every man would stay happy and glad.

06:41.256 --> 06:45.483
He doesn't, of course, and who's the bird that makes him sad?

06:46.164 --> 06:48.047
His fellow man, usually.

06:48.067 --> 06:50.571
I'm thinking about a real good friend of mine.

06:50.591 --> 06:53.816
He had a little ranch that took him years to build up.

06:53.836 --> 06:54.838
Well, just a while back,

06:55.190 --> 07:01.044
Somebody carelessly flipped a lighted match in the dry grass near my friend's place.

07:01.064 --> 07:04.231
Well, that little splinter of burning wood all but wiped him out.

07:05.234 --> 07:10.166
Now, he's building up again, but what a senseless and cruel waste.

07:10.186 --> 07:13.333
I hope heaven makes him glad again, like in this song.

07:17.836 --> 07:21.460
I met a cowboy down the trail just the other day.

07:22.281 --> 07:27.026
I still can hear his howdy boy as he passed and rode away.

07:27.046 --> 07:31.050
He turned in his saddle, he waved his hand, this carefree sort of a lad.

07:31.991 --> 07:39.159
His smile was sent from heaven above, and heaven made him glad.

07:40.240 --> 07:46.847
The white clouds sailed before the wind.

07:47.097 --> 08:17.020
The grass bowed to the touch of him. The hills are where they've always been. Oh, Lord, you made the cowboy happy. The hills are big and grand as you. 
The skies are always clear and blue.

08:19.210 --> 08:44.020
My heart is always smiling too. Oh lord you made the cowboy happy. I know that someday somewhere the trail will surely end.

08:44.894 --> 08:55.478
I know that when I get there, this message I will send.

08:57.668 --> 09:27.439
You gave this happy soul to me. These eyes, that beauty I might see. Then like the wind you set me free. Oh, Lord, you made the cowboy happy. 
Lord, you set the cowboy free.

09:32.431 --> 09:34.153
Yes, sir.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.816
I sure hope that things work out all right for Lloyd's friend.

09:38.559 --> 09:44.987
It's pretty obvious, isn't it, that fire is no respecter of people, places, or things.

09:46.208 --> 09:57.182
A lighted match, carelessly or thoughtlessly thrown aside, can burn up dry grass and a ranch home as easily as quickly as it can dry leaves, the woods, and the farm home.

09:58.323 --> 10:00.666
I'm reminded of an old saying that goes like this.

10:01.338 --> 10:05.285
It takes only one tree to make a million matches.

10:05.305 --> 10:15.023
It takes only one match to destroy a million trees.

10:15.043 --> 10:24.780
Here in the hush of the redwood trees

10:25.503 --> 10:50.582
Here where the ages pass Here in the warmth of the redwood tree

10:51.659 --> 11:01.391
Here where there's peace at last.

11:04.475 --> 11:15.608
See how they raise their lofty heads.

11:29.813 --> 11:59.500
God must have stood where I'm standing now and talk with the redwood tree like he talks with

12:08.508 --> 12:09.649
Redwood tree.

12:11.492 --> 12:13.774
Well, look who's coming up the trail now.

12:13.794 --> 12:14.976
Our popular candidate.

12:15.556 --> 12:19.641
The people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:19.661 --> 12:22.344
Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:22.985 --> 12:24.687
Hello there, folks.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.771
I'd like to ask you a question or two.

12:27.791 --> 12:31.615
Would you toss a lighted match down on the rug in your living room?

12:31.976 --> 12:36.641
Would you throw it into that pile of papers you got stacked in the basement or garage?

12:37.102 --> 12:38.143
Of course you wouldn't.

12:38.596 --> 12:43.402
Please remember that next time you're out driving or out fishing or hunting.

12:43.982 --> 12:48.227
Please be careful with your matches indoors and outdoors.

12:48.748 --> 12:52.632
Remember, a match has a head but no brains.

12:53.053 --> 12:55.015
So use your head, will you?

12:55.896 --> 12:57.458
And there he goes down the trail.

12:58.539 --> 12:59.540
Thank you, Smokey.

13:01.242 --> 13:05.127
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.808
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:10.009 --> 13:19.440
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service and this station you're listening to, that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:20.181 --> 13:31.955
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the sons of the pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:32.515 --> 13:35.839
Remember, only we, you and I,

13:36.072 --> 13:39.217
can prevent forest, woods, and range fires.

13:39.919 --> 13:48.493
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:48.974 --> 13:52.921
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

13:53.281 --> 13:57.709
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

13:57.976 --> 14:06.725
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growling and a-sniffin' the air.

14:07.265 --> 14:11.650
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

14:11.670 --> 14:16.014
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:16.014 --> 14:35.966
[Music.]
