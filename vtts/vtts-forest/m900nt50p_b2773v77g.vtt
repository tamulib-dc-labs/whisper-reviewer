00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
[Silence.]

00:05.000 --> 00:33.410
[Music.]

00:33.410 --> 00:35.273
All right, yeah, thank you, boys, thank you.

00:35.293 --> 00:36.375
Howdy, friends, how y'all?

00:37.657 --> 00:43.568
Me and the boys all gathered around here under the old pine tree today, friends, and we really got a nice program lined out for you.

00:43.989 --> 00:50.240
And we want you to drag up a chair there and just relax and enjoy yourself for the next few minutes here.

00:50.781 --> 00:55.088
We're going to start things off here with a little old tune we get a lot of requests for from time to time.

00:55.469 --> 00:58.354
And I mean this, friends, I'm Knocking at your Door.

01:03.194 --> 01:07.960
Well, I'm knocking at your door again, my darling.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.681
I'm knocking on your door.

01:09.702 --> 01:12.565
Please let me in.

01:12.585 --> 01:19.913
I've got to make you realize, my darling, that no one else is ever meant for me.

01:21.655 --> 01:30.045
Well, you told me once, sweetheart, that no one else could ever come between.

01:30.667 --> 01:52.877
but last night I saw you darling with another. And now today my heart is sad and blue. Well I'm knocking on your door and my darling, they returned the letters that you wrote to me. I won't ever need them now my little darling.

01:53.920 --> 01:58.584
I'm going far across the deep blue sea.

01:59.645 --> 02:01.227
Well, there it is.

02:01.247 --> 02:01.847
Thank you, boys.

02:01.867 --> 02:02.408
Thank you a lot.

02:02.428 --> 02:03.749
I'm knocking at your door, friend.

02:04.349 --> 02:05.991
So just stick around there a few minutes.

02:06.011 --> 02:11.436
You know, while I was singing that song, it's kind of hard for me to do, but I was thinking.

02:11.456 --> 02:16.400
I was thinking about how nice and quiet and peaceable it is out there in the woods.

02:16.600 --> 02:22.746
I was at a place the other day, an old house seat, where years ago there used to be a family lived there.

02:23.198 --> 02:28.985
And all the old buildings was gone, but the old smokehouse, it was still part of the old smokehouse there.

02:29.005 --> 02:34.732
And while I was standing around there, just looking the old place over, there was a lot of thought going through my mind.

02:35.593 --> 02:37.475
And at the same time, I was listening.

02:38.076 --> 02:39.658
And I could hear the birds out there.

02:39.698 --> 02:43.382
I could hear an old quail, an old rooster quail over there way across the field going.

02:45.545 --> 02:47.727
And then you could hear another one over on the other side of the field.

02:47.747 --> 02:48.328
He'd answer him.

02:50.654 --> 02:57.445
And I just couldn't help but thinking about that time a crow flew over and he was going, quark, quark, quark.

02:57.465 --> 02:59.148
He was squawking about something.

02:59.168 --> 03:02.294
But everything was just as quiet and peaceable around this old field.

03:02.995 --> 03:04.257
I looked out across the town.

03:04.277 --> 03:06.601
The old place was growing up.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.686
And that's the way most people speak of it, is growing up.

03:09.706 --> 03:13.793
Little pine trees, grass, everything was very peaceable.

03:14.178 --> 03:16.721
Little pine trees that's coming right out through the grass there.

03:17.802 --> 03:19.484
And it was really something to see.

03:19.865 --> 03:26.193
But this thing was so quiet and peaceful there, I sit down there under an old pine tree standing there.

03:26.213 --> 03:27.995
I'd been standing there for years and years.

03:28.816 --> 03:33.161
I imagine that one time or other little kids played around there that lived there in this house.

03:33.261 --> 03:36.145
I wondered about all those things.

03:36.165 --> 03:40.911
And I was sitting there with this old pine tree, friends, and I noticed little things falling.

03:41.071 --> 03:42.092
Well, I knew what they were.

03:42.342 --> 03:44.386
And I just wonder if any of you out there listening to me.

03:45.087 --> 03:46.970
There was a seed out of the pine cone.

03:47.411 --> 03:53.842
You know, a pine cone comes on a tree, and it grows to a certain stage, and then it busts open, you know, and spreads out.

03:54.223 --> 03:56.147
I know you've seen pine birds all spread out.

03:56.187 --> 03:58.090
I've seen little trinkets and things made out of them.

03:58.610 --> 04:03.655
Well, these little seeds have one wing on them, and the wind blows through the pine trees.

04:03.695 --> 04:04.997
You've heard it blowing through the trees.

04:05.777 --> 04:07.459
Well, the wind's doing her part, too.

04:07.499 --> 04:14.066
She gets these little seeds and carries them way off, no telling how far, sometimes hundreds of yards away from this tree, and then they fall to the ground.

04:14.867 --> 04:17.049
They sprout and come up and go into a tree.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.392
There's a long story connected to all that.

04:19.412 --> 04:22.295
I'd love to have time to tell it all to you, but I haven't got that much time.

04:22.315 --> 04:24.697
We're going to feature our fiddle player here on this next tune.

04:25.618 --> 04:27.520
It's the one that he won the contest with,

04:28.073 --> 04:31.858
And it's really a popular tune among all hoedown fiddle players.

04:31.878 --> 04:35.483
I want all you old-timers to just gather yourself up there and listen the way Jack does it.

04:35.883 --> 04:39.348
Listen to The Mockingbird.

04:40.550 --> 07:36.218
[Music.]

07:36.218 --> 07:38.128
Thank you, Jack.

07:38.148 --> 07:43.075
You know, boy, when he was a quivering that fiddle there, he reminded me of a bowl of this nervous pudding.

07:43.356 --> 07:46.160
I'm telling you, that's really some fiddling there, buddy.

07:46.821 --> 07:49.184
You know, you keep on, you'll be as good as me.

07:49.505 --> 07:50.166
Good or bad.

07:51.568 --> 07:52.189
Thank you, Jack.

07:52.229 --> 07:52.850
Thank you a lot.

07:53.230 --> 07:57.136
Well, getting back to that pine cone, I can't help but think about that pine burr.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.740
Some people call pine burr, pine cones, all the same thing.

08:00.378 --> 08:04.823
But the little seeds blow out there and they take roots there.

08:04.863 --> 08:06.005
And, I mean, they're hard to see.

08:06.025 --> 08:10.891
If you don't know what you're looking for, you'll never in the world find one, especially after it hits in the grass.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.293
Boy, it's just like hunting a needle in a haystack.

08:13.354 --> 08:14.335
But it does its part.

08:14.415 --> 08:20.522
It falls down and gets down in amongst this grass and takes roots there and comes on up and makes a little small pine tree.

08:20.542 --> 08:26.990
And until this little tree is, it's got to have a lot of age on it before you can hardly find it unless you really know what you're looking for.

08:27.030 --> 08:29.693
You have to get down in there and scratch around in the grass to find it.

08:30.854 --> 08:40.707
Now, this guy come along a few days after I was at this old house place, and for some reason, I don't know, he got careless, but this fire got into this old field.

08:41.668 --> 08:43.350
And, friends, you know how an old field is.

08:43.390 --> 08:48.677
It's grown up in grass, and usually grass is knee-deep and sometimes deeper.

08:49.418 --> 08:52.702
And then certain times of year, this grass gets dead and dry.

08:52.723 --> 09:00.793
And the smallest of sparks will set it on fire, and you do have a bad fire there because these little pine trees, thousands of them down under there,

09:01.111 --> 09:02.092
They haven't got a chance.

09:02.132 --> 09:03.534
They can't run and get out of the way.

09:03.835 --> 09:07.340
You just can't realize how much stuff it destroys.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.463
Just from one guy getting careless with a match.

09:10.264 --> 09:12.988
And, well, we just got to do something about it.

09:13.048 --> 09:15.271
I hope you friends out there realize these things.

09:16.433 --> 09:19.297
And you can help me keep these little trees.

09:19.377 --> 09:20.659
I'll help you and you help me.

09:20.679 --> 09:24.204
It's the same old case that you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours, see?

09:24.685 --> 09:27.068
And then we'll have a lot better fishing and hunting

09:27.436 --> 09:28.337
All that sort of stuff.

09:28.357 --> 09:36.249
Well, it's time for some music here now, and here's Jack to do his tune, The Lonesome Whistle.

09:36.389 --> 09:48.607
I was riding number nine, and it's south from Caroline.

09:48.887 --> 09:55.637
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.

09:55.617 --> 09:58.982
I got in trouble, had to roam.

09:59.002 --> 10:02.607
I left my gal, I left my home.

10:02.968 --> 10:10.058
I heard that long, wham, wham, the whistle blows.

10:10.078 --> 10:12.962
Just a kid acting smart.

10:13.483 --> 10:16.948
I went and broke my darling's heart.

10:17.509 --> 10:23.177
I guess I was too young to know.

10:23.579 --> 10:30.973
They took me off the Georgia main, rocked me to the ball and chain.

10:30.993 --> 10:44.659
I heard that long wham, wham, the whistle blow.

10:45.179 --> 11:13.110
All alone I bear the shame i'm a number not a name. I heard that long wham, wham, the whistle blow. All I do is sit and cry when that evening train goes by. I heard that long wham, wham, the whistle blow.

11:13.613 --> 11:26.047
I'll be locked here in the cell till my body's just a shell and my hair turns whiter than snow.

11:27.529 --> 11:30.793
I'll never see that gal of mine.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.377
I'm in Georgia doing time.

11:34.897 --> 11:40.684
I heard that long, wham, wham, the whistle blows.

11:42.858 --> 11:44.019
Well, thank you, Jack.

11:44.039 --> 11:44.380
Thank you.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.063
That's mighty good singing, my boy.

11:47.083 --> 11:47.684
Thank you a lot.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.767
Friends, we're running out of time.

11:50.787 --> 11:52.249
Yeah, let me get my watch out here.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.612
That watch runs when I run.

11:54.892 --> 11:55.153
Yeah.

11:55.753 --> 11:57.075
I got a minute or two left here.

11:57.295 --> 11:58.677
That's time enough to tell you, friend.

11:59.097 --> 12:03.703
You think about that story I told you about the old house seat and the grass and the little pine trees and everything.

12:04.143 --> 12:04.884
It's really nice.

12:05.865 --> 12:07.187
It's something wonderful.

12:07.207 --> 12:07.347
It's

12:07.867 --> 12:09.249
It's just like putting money in the bank.

12:09.269 --> 12:10.611
Take care of these little pine trees.

12:10.651 --> 12:19.565
Because when you're laying up in the bed asleep at night, peaceably, dreaming, while these little pine trees is growing, they're growing bigger and bigger.

12:20.086 --> 12:22.169
And they're worth more money and more money to you.

12:22.189 --> 12:23.190
That's money in your pocket.

12:23.671 --> 12:25.855
And if you get a lot of money, I'll get some of it.

12:26.075 --> 12:27.557
And I'll pass it on to the next man.

12:27.597 --> 12:28.198
He'll get a little.

12:28.519 --> 12:30.321
First thing you know, we'll all get something out of it.

12:30.962 --> 12:31.683
Keep that in mind.

12:32.124 --> 12:35.950
Before I go, I've got a thought here I'd like to leave with you.

12:36.149 --> 12:36.750
I like it.

12:37.151 --> 12:39.755
I want you to see what you think about it.

12:39.775 --> 12:42.259
Live and let live is an old, old saying.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.686
That goes for little trees just like it does for man.

12:46.706 --> 12:51.855
So let's respect God's trade that man and nature plant and keep fire out.

12:52.275 --> 12:55.761
Amen.

13:06.676 --> 13:08.838
Well, friends, that takes care of this little program.

13:09.519 --> 13:10.299
Visit here with you.

13:10.860 --> 13:11.460
We've got to go.

13:12.321 --> 13:14.023
We'll be coming your way again real soon.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.945
Listen to your local announcer, and he'll let you know the exact date and time.

13:17.826 --> 13:29.156
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:30.637 --> 13:34.541
Remember, friends, only you can prevent grass and wood fires.

13:34.981 --> 14:12.622
[Music.]
