This is a very old ballad, Keep Your Garden Clean, an old English ballad.

00:07.686 --> 00:30.257
Come all you pretty families Who flourish in your prime Be sure you keep your garden clean Let no one take your time

00:30.727 --> 00:41.661
In June grows a primrose, but it's no flower for me.

00:43.062 --> 00:56.599
I'll pluck up my primrose and plant a willow tree.

00:58.553 --> 01:18.418
To show to all the world that I loved a false young man.
