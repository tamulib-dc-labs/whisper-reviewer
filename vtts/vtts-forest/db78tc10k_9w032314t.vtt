Once again, the Texas Forest Service brings you 15 minutes with Charlie Adams and his Western All-Star.

00:43.727 --> 00:44.868
Howdy, friends and neighbors.

00:44.888 --> 00:50.254
This is John Scoggin, and here to start off the program is Charlie and the boys with I Get So Lonely.

00:57.473 --> 01:25.742
Baby man, I get so lonely when I dream about you. Can't do without you, that's why I dream about you. If I could only put my arms about you, life would be so fair. 
If you were there, we two could hug and kiss and never tire. I'm on fire, you are my one desire. I get so lonely when I dream about you.

01:25.992 --> 01:30.097
Why can't you be there?

01:30.117 --> 01:36.284
Tossing and turning in my slumber, holding you, it seems.

01:37.765 --> 01:44.593
I give you kisses without number, but only in my dreams.

01:44.613 --> 01:49.198
Oh, baby, mine, I get so lonely when I dream about you.

01:49.364 --> 02:17.650

[Music.]

02:37.711 --> 02:45.904
Baby, man, I get so lonely when I dream about you, can't do without you.

02:46.445 --> 02:48.489
That's why I dream about you.

02:48.509 --> 02:54.679
If I could only put my arms about you, life would be so fair.

02:55.460 --> 02:59.927
If you were there, we too could hug and kiss and never tire.

03:00.728 --> 03:01.910
I'm on fire.

03:02.411 --> 03:04.174
You are my one desire.

03:04.154 --> 03:07.859
I get so lonely when I dream about you.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.883
Why can't you be there?

03:12.365 --> 03:18.814
Tossing and turning in my slumber, holding you it seems.

03:20.316 --> 03:26.585
I give you kisses without number, but only in my dreams.

03:27.346 --> 03:32.052
Oh baby mine, I get so lonely when I dream about you.

03:32.183 --> 03:43.678
And without you, that's why I dream about you If I could only put my arms about you, life would be so fair.

03:43.678 --> 04:00.719
[Silence.]

04:00.719 --> 04:27.553
[Music.]

04:27.736 --> 04:30.760
Thank you.

04:56.339 --> 05:21.148
so so

05:31.321 --> 05:49.629
Well, yes, sir.

05:49.649 --> 05:54.216
You know, Charlie, I hate to tell you this, but I'm actually beginning to like your music.

05:54.697 --> 05:55.999
Well, thanks a lot, John.

05:56.059 --> 05:57.902
Man, if that's coming from you, you know that's

05:58.338 --> 06:01.064
Mouse is about a full-size compliment.

06:01.084 --> 06:01.585
Yes, sir.

06:01.846 --> 06:03.209
I think I'm beginning to like it.

06:03.269 --> 06:07.018
So while I'm feeling this away, how about another little song?

06:07.398 --> 06:09.643
Do you know I'll Tickle Your Toesies?

06:09.984 --> 06:10.666
Do we know it?

06:10.686 --> 06:17.882
Well, then that's one of our Columbia records.

06:22.958 --> 06:30.052
I'll tickle your toes when we rub our noses tonight under the moon.

06:30.072 --> 06:35.523
You will say, baby, let's get ready for the honeymoon.

06:37.046 --> 06:42.216
It'll be thrilling if you're willing when we build a crew.

06:42.871 --> 06:48.859
Cause I'll tickle your toes when we rub our noses tonight under the moon.

06:49.540 --> 06:59.213
Now I never went to high school and I never went to college, but I'm a loving fool.

07:00.214 --> 07:04.660
And that don't take any knowledge, I'll tickle your toes when we rub our noses. You just wait and see.

07:10.124 --> 07:19.078
The love you've been saving is the kind I've been craving, cause you're the one for me.

07:19.078 --> 07:46.712
[Music.]

07:46.712 --> 08:18.606
I'll tickle your toes when we rub our noses tonight under the moon. The love you've been saving is the kind I've been craving.
I can't get started too soon. It'll be thrilling if you're willing when we fell in cool. Cause I'll tickle your toes when we rub 
our noses tonight under the moon. Now i never went to high school and i never went to college. But I'm a loving fool,

08:24.543 --> 08:27.109
That don't take any knowledge.

08:27.971 --> 08:31.900
I'll tickle your toes, when we rub our noses.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.684
You just wait and see.

08:34.927 --> 08:38.455
The love you've been saving is a kind I've been craving, for

08:38.475 --> 08:39.818
you're the one for me.

08:47.172 --> 08:52.780
Well, Charlie, would you like to know something about how the Texas Forest Service uses airplanes to spot forest fires?

08:52.941 --> 08:53.461
How about that?

08:53.481 --> 08:54.663
I sure would, John.

08:54.683 --> 09:05.780
Well, Charlie, it all started back in the spring of 1943 when the Texas Forest Service and the Civil Air Patrol put their heads together and decided to try patrolling the forest with an airplane.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.242
How about it?

09:07.262 --> 09:08.564
And it seemed like a good idea.

09:08.684 --> 09:15.154
So for about 42 hours, Texas Forest Service observers flew with the CAP pilots to try it out.

09:15.725 --> 09:21.713
And the trial was successful, and it was economical, too, so a full-scale test was set up.

09:21.733 --> 09:29.303
An active unit of CAP was organized on January 4, 1944, and nine planes were made available to the CAP.

09:30.004 --> 09:33.209
Two-way radios were borrowed from the Army Air Force.

09:33.229 --> 09:39.257
They were installed in the airplanes, and the first full-scale aerial patrol of our Texas forests got underway.

09:39.938 --> 09:43.723
During the next 14 months, this patrol flew 1,000 hours.

09:44.142 --> 09:49.648
That was just the beginning and from that start has grown the Texas Forest Service's own aerial patrol.

09:50.408 --> 09:58.036
Several radio equipped airplanes are now owned by the Forest Service and the pilots are regular employees of the service.

09:58.056 --> 10:07.446
Other airplanes are under contract and during this year, these planes will fly several times the number of hours of patrol as was flown that first year.

10:07.466 --> 10:12.411
That original test has now become a full scale standard operation.

10:12.509 --> 10:14.032
Well, thanks for the information.

10:14.092 --> 10:15.394
I sure didn't know about that.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.721
And I don't have to ask if it worked.

10:18.741 --> 10:24.030
But just a few minutes ago, well, then we heard those airplanes will then report all those fires that were taking place.

10:24.131 --> 10:25.894
Yes, it really works, Charlie.

10:26.415 --> 10:29.320
And speaking of work, it's time that you did some.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.362
So play, Charlie.

10:30.743 --> 10:33.488
Well, here's Joy going to fail to do poor hobos.

10:40.370 --> 10:47.494
Thank you.

12:43.591 --> 12:56.474
You've heard one of the ways your Texas Forest Service helps to protect your forests, but in spite of their use of the latest, most modern methods of detection and suppression of forest fires, they still need your help.

12:56.634 --> 13:04.048
Be sure to break your mats, use your ashtray, crush your smokes, and be sure your campfires are dead out.

13:04.068 --> 13:07.033
Remember, only you can prevent forest fires.

13:12.818 --> 13:20.199
Charlie Adams and his Western All-Stars have been presented by the Texas Forest Service, a part of the Texas A&M college system.

13:20.219 --> 13:25.996
The program was written and produced by Chester O'Donnell and has been brought to you as a public service feature.

13:26.417 --> 13:28.262
Your announcer has been John Scoggin.

13:28.262 --> 13:38.000
