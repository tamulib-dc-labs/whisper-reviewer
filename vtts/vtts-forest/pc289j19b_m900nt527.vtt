00:02.967 --> 00:06.974
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:06.994 --> 00:08.657
Hello there, folks.

00:08.677 --> 00:11.803
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:12.343 --> 00:17.192
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:17.212 --> 00:21.520
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:21.920 --> 00:24.064
Today, it's James Arness.

00:24.044 --> 00:31.695
And here he is, taking time out of his busy schedule as Marshal Matt Dillon to talk a bit about forest fires.

00:31.715 --> 00:35.741
You know, Smokey, I've seen some mighty bad forest and range fires in my time.

00:35.761 --> 00:41.749
And I know what the fellas who had to fight them meant when they said if we could just get our hands on whoever let this fire get away.

00:42.573 --> 00:47.881
There's no tougher, more frustrating job than fighting a wild running forest or range fire.

00:47.901 --> 00:54.270
We ought to keep this in mind every time we strike a match outdoors, whenever we light up a smoke or whenever we use a campfire.

00:54.731 --> 01:02.002
Wildfires caused by carelessness kill not only the grass and the trees, but wildlife too, and sometimes human beings as well.

01:02.643 --> 01:05.627
Carelessness with fire is bad business.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.471
And it's against the law, so all of us should keep this in mind, too.

01:08.631 --> 01:09.472
Thank you, Marshal.

01:09.833 --> 01:10.894
I mean, Mr. Arness.

01:11.475 --> 01:14.399
Carelessness with fire is bad business.

01:15.060 --> 01:18.485
Everyone pays for such carelessness one way or another.

01:19.326 --> 01:25.695
Now the Sons of the Pioneers here are going to sing an old favorite of yours, Whispering Wind.

01:25.695 --> 01:35.459
[Music.]

01:35.459 --> 01:56.826
All day through there's an ooh Like the sign of a soul in distress. Nighttime blue

01:57.312 --> 02:23.944
Rings an ooh As it sings of a loneliness. Just like a prayer Set adrift in the air, Calling me home again.

02:24.717 --> 02:44.059
Whispering wind comes a wing and a melody to welcome me back.

02:44.059 --> 02:58.197
Whispering wind, keep on singing.

02:58.197 --> 03:06.529
I'm coming to someone who cares.

03:08.051 --> 03:16.924
Stars a-shining the prairie skies.

03:17.845 --> 03:20.509
Guide my steps onto Paradise.

03:27.543 --> 03:42.362
Whispering wind, softly callin', oh weary one, hurry on home.

03:47.675 --> 03:49.778
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:50.319 --> 03:52.582
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:53.082 --> 03:57.929
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

03:57.989 --> 04:03.396
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:03.977 --> 04:16.534
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember...

04:16.852 --> 04:20.939
Only you can prevent forest and range fires.

04:21.200 --> 04:30.397
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:30.417 --> 04:34.444
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:34.805 --> 04:39.433
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:39.433 --> 04:57.937
[Music.]
