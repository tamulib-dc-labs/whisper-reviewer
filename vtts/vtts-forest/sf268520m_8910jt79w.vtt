00:00.000 --> 00:10.763
[Silence.]

00:10.763 --> 00:14.781
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:15.304 --> 00:16.409
Hello there, folks.

00:16.730 --> 00:20.065
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:20.416 --> 00:25.462
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:25.482 --> 00:29.387
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:29.767 --> 00:33.572
Today, it's Dale Robertson of Wells Fargo fame.

00:33.592 --> 00:39.939
Here's a man who's at home anywhere, acting before the cameras or out in the forest building a campfire.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.142
He sure knows his stuff.

00:42.162 --> 00:47.048
I don't go in for funny business, Smokey, when I'm using fire in the forest, and that goes for all my friends.

00:47.737 --> 00:51.041
We enjoy cooking out over an open fire under the trees.

00:51.061 --> 00:53.503
In many picnic areas, fireplaces are provided.

00:53.864 --> 00:58.669
If not, we build our own little fire, making sure first that an open fire is allowed.

00:58.689 --> 01:07.698
We try to be careful every step of the way, clearing the leaves and the grass down to the dirt in a space about six feet across, using rocks as our fireplace and keeping the fire small.

01:08.339 --> 01:11.422
We never go off and leave the fire, not even for a moment.

01:11.442 --> 01:16.748
When we're through with our cooking or roasting marshmallows, we put the fire out, dead out, with plenty of water.

01:17.453 --> 01:21.940
Incidentally, that's a good rule for everyone when it comes to matches, smokes, or campfires.

01:22.140 --> 01:23.282
Be careful.

01:23.302 --> 01:24.584
Don't let them go out alone.

01:24.764 --> 01:25.906
Thank you, Mr. Robertson.

01:26.267 --> 01:30.453
I hope everyone will be as careful as you are in keeping his campfire safe.

01:31.074 --> 01:38.145
Now, how about just sitting back and listening to the Sons of the Pioneers here as they do the Chant of the Wanderer?

01:38.362 --> 02:06.343
Take a look at the sky where the whippoorwill trills, And the mountain so high where the cataract spills, Take a look at the falls and the rippling rills, Hear the wanderlust calls of the whispering hills. The rippling rills, the cataract spills, the whippoorwill trills.

02:07.302 --> 02:12.590
The rippling rills, the cataract spills, the whippoorwill trills.

02:12.630 --> 02:17.617
The rippling rills, the cataract spills, the whippoorwill trills.

02:17.637 --> 02:22.204
Let me live on the range where the tumbleweeds grow.

02:22.244 --> 02:27.112
Let the silver sand change where the prairie winds blow.

02:28.073 --> 02:32.820
Let the wanderers sing where the wanderers go.

02:32.800 --> 02:37.239
Let the melody ring, for he's happy I know.

02:37.279 --> 02:41.376
The wanderers go, the prairie winds blow, the tumbleweeds grow.

02:42.453 --> 02:47.778
The wanderers go, the prairie winds blow, the tumbleweeds grow.

02:47.798 --> 02:52.503
The wanderers go, the prairie winds blow, the tumbleweeds grow.

02:52.803 --> 02:57.388
Let me follow the trail where the buffalo roam.

02:58.068 --> 03:03.353
Let a silver cloud sail where the satin sun shone.

03:03.373 --> 03:08.038
That's a lobo wolf wail in a broken heart tone.

03:08.018 --> 03:28.018
Let it storm, let it gale, still the prairie's my home. A broken heart tone, the satin sun shone, the buffalo roam. 
A broken heart tone, the satin sun shone, the buffalo roam. The rippling rills, the cataract spills, the whippoorwill trills.

03:28.370 --> 03:33.760
The wanderers go, the prairie winds blow, the tumbleweeds grow.

03:33.780 --> 03:39.451
A broken heart tone, the saddened sun shone, the buffalo roam.

03:41.795 --> 03:46.363
The prairie's my home.

03:49.409 --> 03:51.593
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:52.012 --> 03:54.578
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:55.259 --> 04:01.834
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:01.854 --> 04:08.890
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:09.106 --> 04:28.177
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:28.558 --> 04:32.785
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

04:33.068 --> 04:46.707
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame. That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:46.707 --> 05:05.244
[Music.]
