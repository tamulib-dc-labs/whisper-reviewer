00:00.000 --> 00:21.412
[Music.]

00:21.412 --> 00:23.555
Well, howdy, friends.

00:23.575 --> 00:27.240
It's your old neighbor, Jelly Elliott, the three Knotheads.

00:27.260 --> 00:31.386
Now, Sue, we want you to come right on down the trail here and join us under the old pine tree.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.370
We're going to be with you here for about 14 and a half minutes.

00:34.991 --> 00:39.938
Just rootin' and tootin' and carryin' on, sure, and Agnes, doing a little pickin' and singin' here.

00:40.218 --> 00:45.646
A few old corny tunes, some good and some ain't so good and some worse than that.

00:45.666 --> 00:47.188
Well, just stick around there, friends.

00:47.208 --> 00:48.870
Let's come right on down the trail.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.552
Well, all right.

00:52.093 --> 00:52.553
Yes, sir.

00:52.994 --> 00:55.217
Here we go again, friends, for another spasm.

00:55.738 --> 01:03.509
Brought to you with the best wishes and compliments made possible by the State Forestry Service and Uncle Sam's Forestry Service.

01:05.091 --> 01:08.777
We're going to do our best to, we're going to endeavor.

01:09.057 --> 01:10.279
What does endeavor mean?

01:10.379 --> 01:11.521
I done forgot.

01:11.541 --> 01:14.385
But I looked that up last week, and now I done forgot again.

01:14.445 --> 01:15.967
But anyhow, that's what we're going to do.

01:16.047 --> 01:17.389
We're going to sing.

01:17.521 --> 01:20.769
We're going to start things off here featuring Robert, our fiddle player.

01:20.789 --> 01:29.590
He's got a new string on his fiddle, and he's going to just wear all the bug fuzz off of it right now with a tune called Old Joe Clark.

01:29.590 --> 02:17.545
[Music.]

02:17.545 --> 02:18.406
Thank you, Robert.

02:18.426 --> 02:19.247
Thank you there, buddy.

02:19.628 --> 02:20.709
That's pretty good fiddling.

02:20.730 --> 02:21.110
You know what?

02:21.130 --> 02:22.853
That's almost as good as I could do.

02:23.213 --> 02:25.937
I think I ought to play the fiddle, Tom, huh?

02:26.017 --> 02:28.641
Yeah, y'all ought to let me play the fiddle.

02:28.661 --> 02:29.282
That'd burn it.

02:29.322 --> 02:30.884
I bet I'd get a lot of requests.

02:30.904 --> 02:36.532
Friends, if y'all would like to have me play the fiddle one time, write to me.

02:36.552 --> 02:38.815
Just write me a penny postcard or letter.

02:38.835 --> 02:39.496
Bye, George.

02:40.598 --> 02:43.922
I don't give a cat hair what these boys say.

02:44.003 --> 02:45.004
I'll play it anyhow.

02:45.389 --> 02:46.491
I bet I do, Slim.

02:46.551 --> 02:48.193
Slim says I won't get no requests.

02:48.213 --> 02:49.735
Friends, we'd like to hear from you.

02:49.755 --> 02:53.100
If any postcard or letter will do it, just sit down and write us.

02:53.601 --> 02:57.446
Jelly Elliot and the three Knotheads in care of the station that you're now listening to.

02:57.507 --> 03:02.494
Just send it to the station that you've got tuned in there, and we'll get it.

03:02.514 --> 03:03.575
We'd like to have it, too.

03:04.216 --> 03:12.809
You know, I... Friends, I wanted to talk to you here just to Mike, dab and have two dabs about water.

03:13.530 --> 03:13.950
Water.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.092
Now, you might...

03:15.325 --> 03:18.768
Wonder what in the world has water got to do with woods?

03:18.788 --> 03:19.589
Woods.

03:19.609 --> 03:21.091
Well, it's got a lot to do with it.

03:21.131 --> 03:23.994
Woods has got a lot to do with the water, too.

03:24.234 --> 03:28.518
I was, I bought a camp one time and wasn't no trees.

03:28.799 --> 03:29.800
Nowhere around.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.823
And I dug and dug and dug.

03:33.103 --> 03:36.827
I think we put down about seven wells and never did get no water.

03:37.808 --> 03:41.611
And finally just give up the idea and quit.

03:41.631 --> 03:42.893
We put up a system.

03:43.113 --> 03:44.134
Had to to get water.

03:44.772 --> 03:54.741
And now, since I got back up here in the woods where I belong, well, one of them forestry boys was out there the other day, and we got to talking about digging wells.

03:55.342 --> 03:59.325
And I told him about that terrible experience I'd had with digging a well, couldn't get no water.

03:59.886 --> 04:03.209
And he told me, he said, well, Jelly, that's the simplest thing you ever heard of.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.131
He said, I'll tell you why you didn't get any water.

04:05.651 --> 04:06.372
And I said, why?

04:06.392 --> 04:09.615
He said, somebody's cut off the water table leg.

04:10.155 --> 04:11.877
I've never heard tell of a water table.

04:12.245 --> 04:14.688
having a table or much less a leg.

04:14.748 --> 04:17.692
I didn't know what he was talking about, but he knew.

04:18.513 --> 04:21.457
He told me it was just as plain as anything.

04:21.517 --> 04:23.379
I could see it after he told me.

04:23.399 --> 04:31.890
He said that the timber's all cut off, the pasture's overgrazed, the range is all burned off, and that lowers the water table.

04:31.955 --> 05:00.932
the water table that's what he called it the water level i reckon is what he meant that's what i took it to be anyhow it makes the rain run off too fast and the ground can't soak it up like it used to there's not enough roots and and cover and foliage down there and leaves and all that sort of stuff to hold the water there it runs off it gets away for it it goes in the ground i know it i've seen it happen since he mentioned it to me i've seen it happen one time up in the hills and the pine woods there it had the prettiest pine

05:01.250 --> 05:26.515
trees in there and had a spring down there and had it all curbed in and boy that was the coolest best water you ever seen and they come in there and just cut every sapling in there cut all the trees down and that burn if the spring didn't go dry yeah and i wondered why and now i know since that forestry boy told me the water run off them hills them old poor hills water run off fast didn't have time soaking the ground there wasn't no water

05:27.288 --> 05:32.795
Friends, when you keep down far and keep the fire out of the timber and keep it growing, you get a blanket on the ground.

05:32.815 --> 05:37.660
See, leaves and all that, you know, a leaf mold, a lot of people call it.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.822
Well, that holds the water.

05:39.322 --> 05:41.064
It's just like pouring water on a table.

05:41.084 --> 05:44.669
You can take a table and tilt it up to a slope, and you pour water on it.

05:45.109 --> 05:45.650
And what does it do?

05:45.690 --> 05:46.851
It runs right off.

05:46.871 --> 05:48.093
Ain't no water left on the table.

05:48.153 --> 05:50.135
But you can spread a blanket on there, a wool blanket.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.758
Just spread the blanket on the table and pour a bucket of water on the blanket.

05:53.099 --> 05:53.619
What does it do?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.962
It'll take it a week to dry off of that tabletop.

05:56.212 --> 05:57.274
Same thing with the ground.

05:57.314 --> 05:58.977
That's the reason why you can't get no well of water.

05:59.378 --> 06:02.003
Now, the only way to stop that is just stop the forest fires.

06:02.384 --> 06:06.712
Yeah, don't burn off all the grass and the foliage and cut down all the trees and everything.

06:06.732 --> 06:07.573
Let's play another tune.

06:07.894 --> 06:08.996
What do you say I'll sing a song?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.860
I'll sing one about water.

06:11.421 --> 06:13.004
Y'all furred or guinea?

06:13.284 --> 06:15.228
Okay, that makes it unanimous for them.

06:15.248 --> 06:16.310
Me and you are furred.

06:16.590 --> 06:17.031
Here we go.

06:17.111 --> 06:18.574
I'm going to sing Deep Water.

06:18.574 --> 06:40.711
[Music.]

06:40.711 --> 07:08.389
I'm drifting into deep water. I'm starting to care for you. You're getting me in deep water. Be careful what you do. You want a romance but I'm seeking love.

07:08.707 --> 07:15.555
I know I'll regret it when it ends.

07:15.575 --> 07:18.999
I'm drifting into deep water.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.584
Why can't we just be friends?

07:25.647 --> 07:27.469
There we are, drifting into deep water.

07:27.509 --> 07:30.472
But there'll be no deep water if we haven't got any woods.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.755
No leaves on the ground, no grass, no nothing.

07:33.416 --> 07:34.697
That's just funny.

07:34.947 --> 07:36.409
But it's just plain.

07:36.469 --> 07:37.590
It's easy to understand.

07:37.610 --> 07:41.074
You take a farmer, a hill farmer, that farms in the hills.

07:41.494 --> 07:44.998
You never see him plow his rolls up and down the hill, because if he did, what'd happen?

07:45.158 --> 07:46.400
Wash off all of his land.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.423
All wash off and go out in the ocean and do nobody no good.

07:49.463 --> 07:49.964
What does he do?

07:49.984 --> 07:52.146
He plows his rolls around the hill.

07:52.186 --> 07:53.568
That's to keep it from washing off.

07:53.888 --> 07:59.354
Well, that's the trees and the shrubbery and undergrowth and all that sort of stuff, roots and things.

07:59.374 --> 08:03.099
They act as the same purpose with water, with water.

08:03.119 --> 08:04.380
They keep it on the ground.

08:04.782 --> 08:24.221
I believe it's been figured out where in the woods, 90% of the water soaks in the ground, 10% runs off, and where it's cut over clean, no roots, no grass, no nothing, or 90% of the water runs off and 10% soaks in the ground, or vice versa, or something like that.

08:24.361 --> 08:25.623
That's figures on it.

08:25.663 --> 08:26.684
That's straight figures.

08:26.704 --> 08:27.785
That's it.

08:28.505 --> 08:31.108
So that's plain.

08:31.328 --> 08:34.131
I hope that that's understandable.

08:34.499 --> 08:35.340
It is.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.282
That's the way it is, though.

08:36.382 --> 08:38.685
I know all of you know that already.

08:38.706 --> 08:40.428
You just haven't stopped to think about it.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.632
So stop and think about it, friends.

08:42.672 --> 08:44.174
Be careful with your fires.

08:44.194 --> 08:47.319
And don't let them get out and burn up all the timber there.

08:47.719 --> 08:49.923
I'm telling you, lumber is sky high right now.

08:50.283 --> 08:51.726
And you know what the reason for that is?

08:52.066 --> 08:53.128
Scarcity.

08:53.148 --> 08:53.949
There's no lumber.

08:54.430 --> 08:56.493
Scarcity of anything runs the demand up.

08:56.513 --> 08:57.394
Let's sing another song.

08:57.475 --> 08:58.136
Who's going to sing?

08:58.176 --> 09:01.561
Slim, you're going to watch his fiction to yodel, friends.

09:01.641 --> 09:02.903
And when he yodels...

09:03.102 --> 09:04.123
He yodels.

09:04.143 --> 09:07.266
I'm telling you, this is going to be pedestal, friend.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.648
Slim's going to yodel a little bit.

09:09.688 --> 09:11.950
He's going to do one of Hank Williams' tunes.

09:11.970 --> 09:16.674
It made Hank Williams a steak, and maybe Slim can make a hamburger out of it.

09:16.694 --> 09:24.240
Here we go, and it's Lovesick Blues.

09:25.662 --> 09:31.827
I got a feeling called the blues Oh, Lord, since my baby said goodbye

09:33.123 --> 09:37.029
Lord, I don't know what I'll do.

09:37.049 --> 09:39.553
All I do is sit and sigh.

09:39.954 --> 09:44.561
Oh, Lord, that last long day she said goodbye.

09:45.282 --> 09:48.407
Well, Lord, I thought I would cry.

09:49.268 --> 09:51.051
She'll do me, she'll do you.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.894
She's got that kind of loving.

09:53.195 --> 09:57.882
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy.

10:01.658 --> 10:21.118
I hate to think it all over. I've lost my heart it seemed. I've grown so used to you somehow, but I'm nobody sugar daddy now. 
I'm lonesome. I've got the lovesick blues.

10:24.676 --> 10:29.001
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal.

10:29.041 --> 10:32.164
That's what's the matter with me.

10:32.184 --> 10:36.048
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal.

10:36.328 --> 10:38.310
But she don't care about me.

10:39.772 --> 10:43.596
Thought I've tried and I've tried to keep her satisfied.

10:43.916 --> 10:46.419
But she just wouldn't stay.

10:47.620 --> 10:50.363
And now that she is leaving.

10:51.355 --> 10:54.121
This is all I can say.

10:54.682 --> 10:57.608
I've got a feeling called the blues.

10:57.628 --> 11:02.478
Oh, Lord, since my baby said goodbye.

11:02.498 --> 11:04.201
Lord, I don't know what I'll do.

11:04.822 --> 11:08.831
All I do is sit inside.

11:09.191 --> 11:11.997
Oh, Lord, that'll last long day she said goodbye, well, Lord, I thought I would cry.

11:16.820 --> 11:42.523
She'll do me, she'll do you. She's got that kind of lovin'. Lord, I love to hear when she calls me Sweet Daddy. Such a beautiful dream. 
I hate to think it all over I've lost my heart, it seems. I've grown so used to you somehow, but I'm nobody's sugar daddy now. I'm lonesome. 
I've got the lovesick blues.

11:45.490 --> 11:56.185
Thank you, Slim.

11:56.205 --> 11:57.146
Thank you, Bear, buddy.

11:57.587 --> 11:58.488
That's pretty good.

11:58.508 --> 12:01.572
You must have greased that yodel not lately, huh?

12:02.553 --> 12:03.154
What'd you do?

12:03.535 --> 12:04.977
Kill hogs or something?

12:05.477 --> 12:06.799
You done pretty good there.

12:06.819 --> 12:09.102
How about send me a mess of chitlins, buddy?

12:09.964 --> 12:13.308
Friend, yeah, we want to hear from you now.

12:13.348 --> 12:14.049
Don't forget that.

12:14.089 --> 12:14.670
Write us a

12:14.988 --> 12:16.309
penny postcard or letter.

12:16.349 --> 12:24.618
We always out in the woods roaming around just like the rest of the varmints and we like to hear from you occasionally.

12:25.038 --> 12:26.620
Write us a penny postcard or letter.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.844
Just send it to Jelly Elliott and Three Knotheads in care of the station that you're now listening to.

12:31.745 --> 12:39.012
And don't forget, friends, how important water is with timber or timber is with water, rather.

12:39.753 --> 12:41.234
You got to have timber to have water.

12:41.254 --> 12:43.797
Why don't you know, don't you remember a long time ago

12:44.148 --> 12:48.895
Well, Grandpa, he used to get water, just the finest kind of water, 12, 15 feet deep.

12:49.355 --> 12:52.420
And nowadays, you have to get an artesian well.

12:52.460 --> 12:58.048
You got to get a deep water well and go down like you're digging oil well to get a little dab of water.

12:58.068 --> 13:02.294
And then if you ain't careful and get a man knows what he's doing, he'll go dry in the summer.

13:02.754 --> 13:06.139
That's because there's no timber, just like that forestry boy says.

13:06.558 --> 13:09.402
If you'll get a hold of him, he's around there in your neighborhood.

13:09.442 --> 13:19.718
He's always ready to help you with your timber problems in any way and fire problems and help you to keep them from getting out and keep the fire from burning up the woods and everything.

13:19.738 --> 13:21.922
He's a fine feller, just a good old country boy.

13:21.962 --> 13:23.244
He might have on a tie.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.365
Don't pay no attention to that.

13:24.406 --> 13:25.768
We got to go, friends.

13:25.788 --> 13:27.310
We've run plumb out of time here.

13:27.350 --> 13:29.874
Stood up here just like a leather head and run out of time.

13:30.395 --> 13:33.139
But I'd like to leave a thought for the day with you before we go.

13:33.912 --> 13:40.723
A good way to keep the water clean and flowing is to keep the timber green and growing.

13:40.783 --> 13:42.986
Friends, that takes up all the time I got today.

13:43.367 --> 13:46.332
Gonna have to shove off here, but we'll be back with you.

13:46.792 --> 13:50.498
So just stay tuned to the station and listen to the announcer, and he'll let you know.

13:50.799 --> 13:54.925
And remember, friends, only you can prevent wood spars.
