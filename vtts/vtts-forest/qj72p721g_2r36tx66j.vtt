00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
[Silence.]

00:11.523 --> 00:16.248
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:16.268 --> 00:17.669
Hello there, folks.

00:17.869 --> 00:21.332
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:21.773 --> 00:26.798
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:26.818 --> 00:31.682
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:32.143 --> 00:37.028
Today, it's Raymond Burr, known to millions as Perry Mason.

00:37.648 --> 00:40.551
I've asked him to take our case to the people.

00:44.767 --> 01:00.852
Ladies and gentlemen, if just once you had to work side by side with desperate firefighters, feeling the relentless heat, choking up with smoke, knowing the panic that the flaming monster forest fire sometimes sets up in a man,

01:01.456 --> 01:07.382
Why, then I'm sure you'd think twice about flipping a lighted match or cigarette into dry grass or leaves.

01:07.402 --> 01:29.185
If just once you had to walk the silent, desolate trail that is any trail through the black and gray dust of burned-over land, if you could see the pathetic remains of wild birds, of squirrels and rabbits and sometimes deer that couldn't run quite fast enough, well, then I think you would be very careful with your campfire, with any outdoor fire.

01:30.413 --> 01:36.622
Dried stream beds, eroded soil, dead and dying trees.

01:36.642 --> 01:39.847
These are the price of human carelessness and thoughtlessness.

01:41.149 --> 01:44.153
Ladies and gentlemen, these things I know.

01:44.173 --> 01:50.482
Because long before I became Perry Mason, I fought many fires in the forests of the Northwest.

01:50.502 --> 01:55.149
And believe me, fire uncontrolled is an awful thing.

01:56.030 --> 01:56.691
Thank you, sir.

01:57.093 --> 02:06.045
Smokey, there's no doubt Mr. Burr has the feel of the outdoors, so we're sure he'll like the song about the land beyond the sun.

02:06.065 --> 02:24.028
Every day the skies are blue And the grazing's good there too. It's a way off in that land beyond the sun.

02:28.328 --> 02:46.337
Where the cool, clear waters flow And the tumbleweeds don't blow, Gonna rest there when the last big roundup's gone.

02:50.755 --> 03:08.663
When I lay me down at night and the prairie stars are bright on the end of the land beyond the sun.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.976
Come on, old horse, you're kind of dragging.

03:15.697 --> 03:25.250
I know you're tired, but so am I. The road is long and it's uphill, too, but we're gonna make it, boy, and that's for true.

03:25.270 --> 03:33.722
We gotta keep moving till our work's all done, and we'll head into the land beyond the sun.

03:34.158 --> 03:42.771
Al and me, we ought to be there about sundown.

03:45.014 --> 03:53.667
When the big boss counts the cowpokes one by one.

03:55.249 --> 03:59.035
They've all hit the glory trail.

04:00.618 --> 04:14.003
But I'll join them without fail when I head into that land beyond the sun.

04:20.041 --> 04:24.227
Well, that's it for now, folks, and thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:24.247 --> 04:29.274
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:29.314 --> 04:34.781
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:34.801 --> 04:43.353
This is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:43.954 --> 04:48.360
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear,

04:48.577 --> 04:52.723
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:53.324 --> 04:57.411
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:57.811 --> 05:02.158
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

05:02.158 --> 05:10.805
[Music.]
