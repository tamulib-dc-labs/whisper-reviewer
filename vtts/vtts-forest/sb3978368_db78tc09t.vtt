00:37.342 --> 00:46.396
Today, we present the first program in a new series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

00:46.416 --> 00:56.612
In Beaver Dam Forest, an ever-freshening evening wind picks up some of last year's dry leaves and swirls them about, among the trees and across the dirt roads in the forest.

00:56.632 --> 01:03.062
The thin strands of telephone wires begin to swing, and at this moment, someone, somewhere along the line,

01:03.312 --> 01:10.424
reaches for the handle of an old-fashioned wall telephone, still in use in many rural areas, and cranks it hard.

01:10.444 --> 01:13.149
One long crank, three short ones.

01:15.633 --> 01:20.982
Bells ring out in every lookout and guard station, in every nearby farm home.

01:21.002 --> 01:27.092
In the one farm kitchen for which the special ring is intended, a white-haired little old lady answers her phone.

01:33.029 --> 01:33.530
Hello?

01:34.291 --> 01:36.554
This is Sarah McDonald talking.

01:36.574 --> 01:37.496
Who?

01:37.516 --> 01:37.937
Who?

01:38.798 --> 01:42.904
Lamb's sakes, I declare that wind is picking up and off, isn't it?

01:42.924 --> 01:45.328
Hold on a minute, dearie, I'll just touch the window.

01:48.252 --> 01:50.997
Hello, this is me again, Sarah McDonald.

01:51.658 --> 01:53.060
Oh, it's you, Molly.

01:53.661 --> 01:57.066
Well, I think that's mighty nice you're calling to see how I am.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.870
Truth to tell, I don't feel well at all.

02:00.451 --> 02:01.753
Small trouble, Molly.

02:02.003 --> 02:05.936
Like I was telling Mr. McDonald, just the other night it was.

02:05.956 --> 02:09.528
I don't know what we'll do if I come down real bad and... Hello?

02:09.548 --> 02:11.254
Hello, Mrs. McDonald?

02:11.673 --> 02:14.137
Now, who in the world stopped breaking in, Molly?

02:14.157 --> 02:16.541
Oh, Mrs. McDonald, I'm awfully sorry.

02:16.561 --> 02:18.825
This is June Cameron, Ranger Scott Sneed.

02:19.186 --> 02:20.568
I've just got to talk to you.

02:20.769 --> 02:21.891
Why, hello, dearie.

02:22.151 --> 02:24.896
Now, Molly, you just hang on whilst I talk to June.

02:25.236 --> 02:26.138
What is it, child?

02:26.178 --> 02:27.861
I'm trying to locate Uncle Bill.

02:28.202 --> 02:29.604
I need your help.

02:29.624 --> 02:30.365
There, there.

02:30.446 --> 02:31.507
Now, what's the trouble?

02:31.527 --> 02:35.434
A big pine tree has crashed down on our recreation hall here at Pine Lake Camp.

02:35.594 --> 02:36.516
Dear, dear, anybody.

02:36.496 --> 02:37.157
get hurt?

02:37.177 --> 02:41.000
No, but the wires from the power plant are down, too, and we won't have any lights.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.862
Well, Uncle Bill will know what to do.

02:43.242 --> 02:44.764
Did you try the ranger station?

02:44.784 --> 02:45.684
It's no use.

02:45.945 --> 02:47.346
The ranger is out in the forest.

02:47.746 --> 02:52.571
I know he'll be in touch with Hawk Tower by radio, but our line from the capture of the tower must be down.

02:52.931 --> 02:55.273
I tried to get Joe there and... Hello?

02:55.633 --> 02:56.334
Hello, June?

02:56.374 --> 02:58.976
Oh, dear, now her line is out, too.

02:59.617 --> 03:01.319
Molly, I'll just have to call you later.

03:01.939 --> 03:04.081
Dear me, what is that Hawk Tower ring?

03:04.461 --> 03:05.102
Oh, here it is.

03:05.538 --> 03:07.220
Two shorts and one long.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.281
Now, if I can only get that boy.

03:09.321 --> 03:27.178
As Mrs. McDonald tries to contact Hawk Tower, Ranger Bill and his young assistant Sam, their day's work accomplished, make their weary way along a distant forest trail.

03:27.198 --> 03:29.840
Well, there's the truck, Ranger Bill.

03:29.860 --> 03:31.942
Boy, am I glad to see it, too.

03:31.962 --> 03:32.963
You're tired, eh, Sam?

03:33.938 --> 03:36.622
Well, marking timber all day isn't exactly child's play.

03:36.743 --> 03:39.287
But we sure kept ahead of the loggers, didn't we, Ranger?

03:39.307 --> 03:40.329
Yes, Sam.

03:40.349 --> 03:42.552
The trees we marked will keep them pretty busy for a while.

03:45.036 --> 03:46.979
Seems that wind's building up.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.383
Gee, just look at those black clouds in the west.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.347
Somebody's gonna get wet.

03:51.367 --> 03:53.110
I don't like the way things are looking over there.

03:54.472 --> 03:58.959
Sam, you load the marking axe and other equipment while I try to raise Joe at Hawk Tower on our portable radio.

03:58.979 --> 03:59.440
Yes, sir.

04:02.609 --> 04:03.871
SP7 to Hawk Tower.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.174
SP7 to Hawk Tower.

04:07.056 --> 04:07.877
Come in, Hawk Tower.

04:10.721 --> 04:12.283
Holy smoke, Ranger Bill.

04:12.584 --> 04:14.326
Look what I found here by the road.

04:14.707 --> 04:15.748
An Indian arrowhead.

04:15.828 --> 04:16.189
Look.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.773
Say, that is a beauty, Sam.

04:18.793 --> 04:19.934
SP7 to Hawk Tower.

04:20.155 --> 04:22.298
Gee, my first Indian arrowhead.

04:22.678 --> 04:24.040
How did it get here, Ranger Bill?

04:24.161 --> 04:27.005
Well, there were Indians all through this country two to three hundred years ago.

04:27.746 --> 04:30.270
This little spot here might have been one of their overnight camps.

04:31.591 --> 04:31.992
Hello?

04:32.292 --> 04:32.873
Hawk Tower.

04:33.614 --> 04:34.435
Hello, Hawk Tower.

04:35.416 --> 04:36.698
I wonder if Joe's getting us.

04:36.718 --> 04:40.623
Gosh, an Indian Arrowhead more than 200 years old.

04:40.643 --> 04:41.864
That's hard to believe.

04:43.486 --> 04:44.808
Hawk Tower to SB7.

04:45.569 --> 04:46.870
Hawk Tower to SB7.

04:47.311 --> 04:48.272
Hello, Ranger Bill.

04:48.693 --> 04:50.815
I can hardly hear you, but listen.

04:50.835 --> 04:53.138
They're in trouble at Pine Lake Camp and need your help.

04:53.539 --> 04:54.180
Can you hear me?

04:54.500 --> 04:55.702
Come in.

04:55.722 --> 04:57.143
SB7 back to Hawk Tower.

04:57.724 --> 04:59.046
You're coming in clear here, Joe.

04:59.426 --> 04:59.987
Go ahead.

05:00.980 --> 05:02.442
Hawk Tower back to SP-7.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.245
It's the Wind Ranger, Bill.

05:04.586 --> 05:06.128
It blew down a big tree.

05:06.489 --> 05:09.934
Knocked out the power line and our own phone line between the camp and the tower.

05:10.455 --> 05:11.717
Mrs. McDonald called me.

05:12.198 --> 05:12.538
Come in.

05:13.220 --> 05:13.700
Hello, Joe.

05:14.441 --> 05:15.944
Now listen carefully.

05:15.964 --> 05:17.847
Sam and I will head for Pine Lake Camp.

05:18.288 --> 05:19.950
You come down off the tower.

05:19.970 --> 05:23.396
Now follow the phone line from Hawk Tower down to the camp.

05:23.416 --> 05:27.082
Fix the broken line if you can and then join us at camp for further orders.

05:27.102 --> 05:27.983
Did you get that, Joe?

05:28.418 --> 05:29.439
Okay, Ranger Bill.

05:29.820 --> 05:30.641
I'll meet you at camp.

05:30.961 --> 05:31.662
Hawk tower off.

05:32.483 --> 05:33.244
SP-7 off.

05:35.006 --> 05:36.107
Okay, Sam.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.550
Put that Indian arrowhead away and let's get going.

05:38.570 --> 05:45.718
It'll be dark before we get to camp.

05:46.639 --> 05:56.130
SP-7 off.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.389
Here's the camp ranger, Bill.

06:03.850 --> 06:05.632
Golly, it's pitch black.

06:05.652 --> 06:07.695
No light showing anywhere in this rain.

06:08.236 --> 06:09.498
Wow, what a night.

06:10.039 --> 06:11.421
Say, where is everybody?

06:11.441 --> 06:13.684
The youngsters must all be in their cabins.

06:13.704 --> 06:16.288
I'll just turn the trucks or our headlights around the recreation hall.

06:17.570 --> 06:17.990
There we are.

06:20.254 --> 06:24.360
Well, there's the big tree that blew down on the recreation hall.

06:25.722 --> 06:26.984
No real harm done, I'd say.

06:27.204 --> 06:28.526
Say, here comes somebody.

06:28.786 --> 06:30.209
She doesn't look like June, though.

06:30.509 --> 06:31.230
Oh, that's not June.

06:31.784 --> 06:32.866
Hello there, young lady.

06:33.587 --> 06:34.749
Are you Ranger Bill?

06:34.909 --> 06:35.550
That's right, miss.

06:35.951 --> 06:36.792
Mrs. Sam Freeman.

06:37.233 --> 06:38.675
June is busy with the campers.

06:39.236 --> 06:40.678
Some of them are pretty frightening.

06:41.099 --> 06:42.441
Well, I'm Penny Perkins.

06:42.461 --> 06:43.142
How do you do?

06:43.162 --> 06:45.646
I'm a counselor, too, and June and I are good friends.

06:46.487 --> 06:49.051
Well, I've been kind of frightened, too.

06:49.231 --> 06:50.473
Oh, come on, now.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.996
We'll fix the power line in a jiffy.

06:52.316 --> 06:54.459
Soon as the lights come on, everything will be all right.

06:54.560 --> 06:54.960
You'll see.

06:55.401 --> 06:57.885
I was in the recreation hall when the tree fell on it.

06:58.706 --> 06:59.968
Oh, it was terrible.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.569
Here's June now.

07:02.170 --> 07:02.890
Hello, Uncle Bill.

07:02.971 --> 07:04.052
Hello, Sam.

07:04.072 --> 07:04.592
Oh, hi, June.

07:04.612 --> 07:06.755
Oh, I'm awfully glad you're here, Uncle Bill.

07:06.935 --> 07:08.596
We came as soon as we got your message, June.

07:09.297 --> 07:10.759
You've had a pretty rough time, haven't you?

07:10.939 --> 07:12.961
Oh, it hasn't been any fun, I can tell you.

07:13.461 --> 07:15.664
The camp director's away, and I've been in charge.

07:16.104 --> 07:19.588
Oh, Uncle Bill, everything went wrong, the wind and the lights.

07:19.608 --> 07:21.890
Oh, now, June, it's not your fault.

07:22.511 --> 07:25.013
Please don't... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, cut it out, both of you.

07:25.894 --> 07:28.257
And there's no sense of us all standing out here in the rain.

07:28.938 --> 07:29.398
Look, June.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.642
You go along and take care of your campers.

07:31.662 --> 07:35.768
And, Penny, suppose you get the fire going in the recreation hall and make some nice hot cocoa.

07:36.168 --> 07:37.731
We'll all be needing it in a little while.

07:38.051 --> 07:41.997
Oh, but that big old tree lying up there on the roof, won't it crash through?

07:42.017 --> 07:44.140
Now, there's nothing to worry about, Penny.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.402
We'll get the tree off the roof.

07:45.862 --> 07:46.463
Now, go on.

07:46.483 --> 07:46.764
Go on.

07:46.824 --> 07:47.645
Get going, both of you.

07:48.526 --> 07:49.207
We'll see you later.

07:49.768 --> 07:54.094
Gee, I wonder how Joe is making out Ranger Bill.

07:54.475 --> 07:57.940
It's going to be plenty tough following that phone line through the woods in the dark.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.402
Now, Joe has his flashlight along.

07:59.585 --> 08:00.267
He'll be all right.

08:01.450 --> 08:04.038
Well, now, we've been standing around palavering long enough.

08:04.760 --> 08:05.662
Let's go to work, boy.

08:05.923 --> 08:11.258
Okay, Ranger.

08:11.399 --> 08:11.940
Okay.

08:20.797 --> 08:30.571
Well, I got here in time for the refreshments anyway.

08:30.931 --> 08:32.834
You made good time fixing that phone line, Joe.

08:33.114 --> 08:34.776
Oh, it wasn't a tough job, Ranger Bill.

08:35.277 --> 08:39.883
All I had to do was connect the two ends of the phone line where it broke, just the way you taught Sam and me.

08:39.944 --> 08:40.324
Fine.

08:40.490 --> 08:44.177
Well, this is a happy ending to a not-too-perfect day, I'd say.

08:44.338 --> 08:47.905
What I want to know, Ranger Bill, is just why that big tree blew over.

08:48.225 --> 08:51.191
Smaller trees around camp took the force of the wind all right.

08:51.392 --> 08:53.356
Yes, Ranger Bill, what about that?

08:53.616 --> 08:59.528
Well, I think you'll all be surprised to learn that that big pine tree was doomed to die a long time ago.

09:00.368 --> 09:03.152
Then it wasn't just the wind alone, Uncle Bill?

09:03.472 --> 09:04.033
No, June.

09:04.594 --> 09:07.979
The wind was just the final step in the downfall of a fine old tree.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.502
Well, now, here's the story as I see it.

09:11.203 --> 09:15.670
There was a pretty bad forest fire years ago before this camp was even built.

09:15.690 --> 09:17.913
Now, the fire killed a lot of small trees outright.

09:18.674 --> 09:23.160
Some of the big timber, like the pine tree, was wounded or scarred at the base.

09:23.180 --> 09:24.322
The fire left its mark.

09:25.023 --> 09:29.970
And into the wound, probably blown in by a gentle wind, came little specks of disease.

09:30.558 --> 09:34.404
And they went to work on the stout heart of the tree and gradually destroyed the heartwood.

09:35.185 --> 09:36.948
And the heartwood gives the tree its strength.

09:37.428 --> 09:38.089
Oh, I see.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.633
It's kind of like disease in human beings, isn't it?

09:40.693 --> 09:41.435
Exactly, Sam.

09:42.316 --> 09:49.387
But that kind of disease, although it is an enemy of the forest, doesn't compare with the other disease and insect enemies which give us real concern.

09:49.587 --> 09:53.613
You mean more trees are going to fall on our recreation hall, Ranger Bill?

09:53.633 --> 09:56.818
No, I don't mean right here, Penny.

09:57.170 --> 10:02.936
but I've seen some forest areas that looked as though a terrible fire had swept through and killed all the trees.

10:02.956 --> 10:07.861
And yet, bark beetles, one of the worst forest pests, had done the damage.

10:07.941 --> 10:14.187
Fire is a destructive agency, but actually, insects and diseases cause more damage to our forests than fire.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.690
Well, that's hard to believe, Uncle Bill.

10:16.730 --> 10:17.911
That's true, though, June.

10:17.931 --> 10:22.376
Ranger Bill, I've been looking at this Indian arrowhead I found, and it set me thinking.

10:22.596 --> 10:23.917
Oh, let me see it, Sam.

10:24.478 --> 10:24.578
What?

10:25.267 --> 10:27.089
Just what were you thinking, Sam?

10:27.109 --> 10:32.896
Well, back in the days when the Indians lived around here, weren't there insects and forest diseases here then?

10:33.437 --> 10:34.598
That's a mighty good question.

10:34.858 --> 10:36.981
Here, Uncle Bill, let me fill your cup again.

10:37.141 --> 10:38.803
Oh, thanks, June.

10:38.823 --> 10:42.247
This cocoa penny made is really tough.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.508
Get back to your question, Sam.

10:44.570 --> 10:49.435
When the Indians roamed these woods, there were insect pests and some pretty bad disease epidemics, too.

10:50.296 --> 10:54.261
But the Indians were few in number compared to the present population in this country.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.921
With the white man came destructive cutting of the forest.

10:58.502 --> 11:03.129
More and more forest fires, greater and greater use of the land.

11:03.149 --> 11:05.232
Now, the whole natural setup is different today.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.437
The white man, frankly, is responsible for that.

11:08.457 --> 11:13.545
But people have to eat, Uncle Bill, and we do need wood for homes and a great many other things.

11:13.685 --> 11:14.827
Well, of course we do, Joan.

11:15.428 --> 11:20.996
But one of the prices we have to pay is the constant fight against insect pests and disease.

11:21.016 --> 11:22.358
And there's even more to this story.

11:23.215 --> 11:28.420
Since Indian days, some very bad insects and diseases have been brought into the United States.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.382
And they've raised real problems, I can tell you.

11:30.402 --> 11:32.564
You mean someone actually brought them in?

11:33.105 --> 11:34.687
Or who would do anything like that?

11:35.487 --> 11:36.929
It wasn't intentional, Penny.

11:37.750 --> 11:40.452
I'm thinking of chestnut blight, for example.

11:40.472 --> 11:44.056
It came from Asia, before our present plant quarantine laws came into being.

11:44.937 --> 11:49.101
And it's just about wiped out all of this country's wonderful chestnut trees.

11:49.121 --> 11:51.163
And then there's the gypsy moth, from France.

11:51.751 --> 11:54.835
And it's now killing forest and shade trees over a large area.

11:56.057 --> 12:00.403
I could name a lot more that are a real headache to forest fires throughout the country.

12:00.423 --> 12:03.067
But can something be done about from Uncle Bill?

12:03.247 --> 12:03.768
Yes, June.

12:04.368 --> 12:07.232
A great deal of the damage can be prevented.

12:07.252 --> 12:15.524
First, we try to kill the insects and rid the forest of disease by direct attack on them, felling and burning the infected trees, or through the use of chemical spray.

12:16.645 --> 12:21.572
But the best and least expensive way is just to take good care of the forest.

12:22.075 --> 12:27.382
to keep the trees healthy and strong, so they'll be able to withstand the attacks of their insects and disease enemies.

12:28.503 --> 12:34.871
Well, here in Beaver Dam Forest, we're trying to keep the natural balance through proper cutting practices and other good forest management.

12:37.855 --> 12:40.538
I guess I've been talking long enough now, and it is getting late.

12:41.139 --> 12:43.181
We'd better be rolling along, ladies.

12:43.201 --> 12:44.703
I don't think you'll have any more trouble tonight.

12:44.903 --> 12:46.325
Oh, don't go.

12:46.345 --> 12:48.267
Oh, gee, it's been nice here before the fire.

12:48.648 --> 12:51.171
Oh, can't we have a little song before you leave, Uncle Bill?

12:51.370 --> 12:56.255
You said yourself that a campfire isn't really a campfire unless there's music.

12:56.355 --> 12:58.617
Well, so I did, Joan, but it is late.

12:58.638 --> 13:00.179
Wait a minute, Ranger Bill.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.942
All right, Sam, here's your chance.

13:03.322 --> 13:05.585
Get out that harmonica of yours and give us a treat.

13:05.945 --> 13:07.947
You've been practicing all winter.

13:07.967 --> 13:08.488
Now give.

13:08.548 --> 13:10.209
Oh, yes, Sam.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.471
Well, okay.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.053
Ranger Bill, didn't you say something about rolling along?

13:14.574 --> 13:16.496
How about a little salute to the young ladies?

13:17.037 --> 13:18.458
Oh, wonderful.

13:18.792 --> 13:22.795
Good night, Uncle Bill.

13:22.815 --> 13:24.057
Night, Ranger Bill.

13:24.157 --> 13:24.617
Night, Joe.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.018
Night, Joe.

13:29.521 --> 13:30.982
All's well that ends well.

13:31.843 --> 13:35.927
And so we'll leave Ranger Bill and his young friends until next time.

13:35.947 --> 13:40.651
Be sure to join them when they set out to help that nice old lady, Mrs. McDonald.

13:40.671 --> 13:44.354
They're going to run into plenty of trouble because of a very stubborn man.

13:44.794 --> 13:48.057
The story, Old McDonald Had Some Wood.

13:48.610 --> 13:53.159
Bill Scott, Forest Ranger, comes to you with the cooperation of the Forest Service, U.S.

13:53.199 --> 13:54.662
Department of Agriculture.

13:54.682 --> 13:59.232
Bill Scott is written by Bill Berghoffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokaw.

13:59.693 --> 14:04.763
Your narrator has been Al Reilly.

14:17.602 --> 14:32.168
THE END

14:54.743 --> 14:57.818
The End
