00:27.807 --> 00:31.392
Bill Scott, Forest Ranger!

00:38.822 --> 00:46.052
Today, we present the fifth program in a new series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

00:46.913 --> 00:54.523
Our scene is the interior of the little cabin perched high on the top of Hawk Tower, fire sentinel of a large part of Beaver Dam Forest.

00:54.638 --> 01:00.871
Ranger Bill and Sam have made a surprise call on the Ranger's other assistant, Joe, on duty as fire lookout.

01:01.612 --> 01:10.831
While Ranger Bill's experienced eye takes in the appearance of the cabin and the condition of the tower man's equipment, Sam and Joe stand silently, watching the Ranger's every move.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.715
It's warm in the cabin,

01:13.268 --> 01:17.115
Strong summer sun beats down on the metal roof and walls.

01:17.135 --> 01:22.465
And in the distance, waves of shimmering heat seem to rise from the dry forest itself.

01:22.485 --> 01:24.188
There's no doubt about it.

01:24.208 --> 01:26.152
This is fire weather.

01:26.172 --> 01:27.775
Bad fire weather.

01:27.795 --> 01:31.682
But if Ranger Bill is really concerned, he doesn't seem to show it.

01:31.797 --> 01:34.541
You're doing a real good job keeping this cabin clean, Joe.

01:34.921 --> 01:35.762
Thank you, Ranger Bill.

01:36.043 --> 01:37.345
Equipment's in fine shape, too.

01:38.106 --> 01:39.748
I like to see a polished fire finder.

01:40.188 --> 01:40.990
Keeps it from rusting.

01:41.951 --> 01:46.537
Joe must have seen us coming up the trail and cleaned up everything before we got here.

01:46.898 --> 01:47.999
I did not, Sam.

01:48.420 --> 01:53.446
If I'd known Ranger Bill was going to inspect today, I'd have put a pot of coffee on the stove for him.

01:53.867 --> 01:55.109
Just relax, Joe.

01:55.129 --> 01:56.050
Sam's kidding you.

01:56.468 --> 01:58.550
And I'm not going to stay long enough to have coffee.

01:58.751 --> 02:00.593
But I didn't know you were coming, Ranger Bill.

02:00.893 --> 02:01.574
Honestly.

02:01.594 --> 02:02.815
Of course not.

02:02.835 --> 02:03.736
Now, where's your log?

02:03.896 --> 02:04.257
Log?

02:04.717 --> 02:11.485
Oh, oh, you mean the book that Joe uses to recall the smoke he sees, the action he takes, phone calls, and stuff like that.

02:12.306 --> 02:13.287
There it is, Ranger Bill.

02:13.347 --> 02:13.527
Where?

02:13.747 --> 02:14.768
Right near the fire finder.

02:14.929 --> 02:15.429
Oh, yes, thanks.

02:16.470 --> 02:22.577
Oh, by the way, while I check the log, Sam, you help keep Joe's sharp lookout for any sign of smoke in the forest.

02:23.182 --> 02:24.884
I'll have to tell you how dry it is out there.

02:25.044 --> 02:25.605
Yes, sir.

02:26.445 --> 02:27.547
Say, there's my friend.

02:27.907 --> 02:30.069
Funny-looking flying contraption again, Sam.

02:30.470 --> 02:31.651
What are you talking about?

02:31.851 --> 02:32.532
Look over there.

02:33.072 --> 02:33.773
Out of the forest.

02:34.053 --> 02:35.114
That big farm there.

02:35.475 --> 02:36.236
See that airplane?

02:36.616 --> 02:37.457
Airplane?

02:37.477 --> 02:39.339
Why, Joe, that's a helicopter.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.360
Oh, sure, I know it.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.562
But it is a funny-looking contraption.

02:42.923 --> 02:44.004
It's been around all week.

02:44.404 --> 02:46.767
Oh, Chuck Evans finally got his helicopter, eh?

02:47.067 --> 02:47.868
Who's Chuck Evans?

02:48.008 --> 02:49.129
Very good friend of mine, boys.

02:49.650 --> 02:51.872
He and I palled around a lot when we were at college.

02:52.156 --> 02:54.459
Chuck took agriculture while I was studying forestry.

02:54.779 --> 02:56.801
Oh, is that his farm way over there?

02:57.082 --> 02:57.502
Yes, Joe.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.845
Done a swell job of building it up, too.

03:00.686 --> 03:03.008
Chuck is one of your real modern farmers, you might say.

03:03.529 --> 03:08.494
Practices soil conservation, uses the latest farm equipment, and he does a bang-up job.

03:08.755 --> 03:12.279
But the helicopter, that's not part of his farm equipment, is it?

03:12.299 --> 03:13.960
Chuck plans to use it that way, Sam.

03:14.481 --> 03:19.447
For spraying insecticides on his crops, sowing grass seed on his pastures, things like that.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.728
And, of course, to travel it.

03:21.232 --> 03:23.075
He'll have fun and still use it to work with.

03:23.455 --> 03:23.876
Oh, look.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.458
He's headed out into the forest.

03:25.518 --> 03:27.501
Golly, he flies low, doesn't he?

03:27.521 --> 03:29.905
That plane just seems to skim the treetops.

03:29.925 --> 03:31.587
That's one of the features of a helicopter.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.730
Its ability to fly low and it slows down.

03:33.750 --> 03:34.371
Say, wait a minute.

03:34.872 --> 03:35.873
Do you see what I see?

03:36.014 --> 03:36.634
What is it, Joe?

03:36.654 --> 03:37.436
Do you mean the plane?

03:37.496 --> 03:38.057
No, no, no.

03:38.077 --> 03:39.158
Let me have your binoculars, Joe.

03:39.338 --> 03:39.939
Here you are, sir.

03:41.021 --> 03:41.822
Let me adjust them.

03:42.528 --> 03:43.329
Good gravy.

03:43.389 --> 03:43.670
Smoke.

03:43.810 --> 03:45.273
Well, Ranger Bill, let me see.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.034
Here are the glasses.

03:46.054 --> 03:47.336
I'm going to look carefully.

03:47.356 --> 03:48.919
Right where Chuck Evans has started to circle.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.161
He must have seen it then, too.

03:50.522 --> 03:51.183
Oh, I see it.

03:51.203 --> 03:51.544
I see it.

03:51.804 --> 03:53.787
It looks like a thin column of mist.

03:53.807 --> 03:55.310
Oh, and it's miles from here.

03:55.430 --> 03:57.794
Yes, I place it way off there in the Deer Creek country.

03:58.516 --> 03:59.718
Couldn't be in a worse place.

04:00.018 --> 04:03.665
Golly, there isn't a road or trail into that area, is there, Ranger Bill?

04:03.765 --> 04:05.127
No, Sam, and that's the trouble.

04:05.798 --> 04:10.382
There's a fire in there in just about the most valuable watershed and timber area in Beaver Dam Forest.

04:10.582 --> 04:10.883
Golly.

04:11.043 --> 04:14.926
If it should blow up, I just don't know what... I'd like to get my hands on the bird who started it.

04:15.226 --> 04:18.890
I'm afraid this is the one case in ten where a human being is not at fault.

04:19.110 --> 04:19.670
Oh, sure.

04:19.991 --> 04:22.453
That dry lightning we had here several days ago.

04:22.573 --> 04:24.194
Yes, lightning must have stuck a tree.

04:24.715 --> 04:27.958
The fire has probably been smoldering ever since and has just broken out.

04:27.978 --> 04:33.022
But I recorded all the lightning strikes I saw, and I've checked them every day since.

04:33.082 --> 04:35.164
Now it's possible to miss one or two, Joe.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.929
This one is just one that showed up.

04:37.631 --> 04:38.533
Well, we've got to get busy.

04:39.315 --> 04:42.383
It'll take hours to get back in there on Deer Creek and... Look, Ranger Bill.

04:42.724 --> 04:45.050
Mr. Evans' helicopter's headed straight this way.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.053
Good work.

04:46.815 --> 04:48.900
I bet Chuck wants to make sure that we've seen the smoke.

04:49.471 --> 04:51.194
Now, Joe, you get to your phone.

04:51.234 --> 04:53.098
No, no, no, better use the radio.

04:53.118 --> 04:56.044
Get a bearing from Devil's Knob Tower and locate your fire.

04:56.064 --> 04:59.591
Then contact that trail building crew at Twin Fox and head them onto the fire.

04:59.611 --> 05:03.439
But, Ranger Bill, they're all of 15 miles from Deer Creek.

05:03.459 --> 05:03.739
I know.

05:03.759 --> 05:06.385
And they'll have at least a 10-mile hike into the area.

05:06.425 --> 05:07.106
I know that, boy.

05:07.246 --> 05:09.150
We've just got to hope they'll get there in time.

05:09.586 --> 05:11.168
Sam and I will head in, too, from here.

05:11.589 --> 05:12.170
Here he comes.

05:12.490 --> 05:13.492
Mr. Evans, I mean.

05:13.952 --> 05:15.955
Golly, he's flying close to the tower.

05:15.975 --> 05:17.037
I can even see him now.

05:17.457 --> 05:18.218
He knows I'm here.

05:18.799 --> 05:20.702
Probably has seen my pickup truck down below.

05:20.922 --> 05:22.765
See, he's pointing back toward the smoke.

05:23.045 --> 05:24.688
Hawk Tower to Devil's Knob Tower.

05:24.988 --> 05:25.689
Hawk Tower to Devil's Knob Tower.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.512
Chuck is headed back to his farm.

05:27.532 --> 05:28.093
Come on, Sam.

05:28.573 --> 05:29.114
No, wait.

05:29.134 --> 05:29.394
Joe.

05:29.615 --> 05:29.935
Yes, sir?

05:30.256 --> 05:31.618
I'm trying to get Devil's Knob.

05:31.678 --> 05:32.980
Well, carry on as I told you, Joe.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.825
And if the smoke builds up, get as many men on their way to that fire as you think are needed.

05:37.109 --> 05:37.970
Now stay with it, boy.

05:38.050 --> 05:38.411
Yes, sir.

05:38.811 --> 05:40.173
Hawk Tower to Devil's Knob.

05:40.854 --> 05:41.996
Let's go, Sam.

05:42.016 --> 05:43.098
There's no time to spare.

05:43.198 --> 05:43.658
Okay.

06:03.747 --> 06:05.530
Now that's Chuck Evans' place just ahead there.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.555
We haven't wasted much time as yet.

06:07.855 --> 06:09.779
Oh, I see him, Ranger Bill, in that field there.

06:10.340 --> 06:12.503
Isn't that Mr. Evans standing near the plane?

06:12.623 --> 06:13.445
That's Chuck, all right.

06:14.026 --> 06:15.689
And he hasn't cut the plane's motor either.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.690
That's good.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.994
Golly, don't drive too close, Ranger Bill.

06:19.656 --> 06:20.397
Well, here we are.

06:22.961 --> 06:23.602
Hello, Bill.

06:23.803 --> 06:25.465
I had a hunch you'd ride this way.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.487
Made good time, too.

06:26.848 --> 06:29.192
I never could outsmart you, Chuck, could I?

06:29.212 --> 06:30.454
I take it you know why I'm here.

06:30.856 --> 06:33.980
Oh, by the way, this is Sam Freeman on a summer job with me.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.922
Oh, hello, Mr. Evans.

06:35.082 --> 06:36.284
Nice to know you, Sam.

06:36.304 --> 06:37.505
Well, Ranger, what are we waiting for?

06:37.526 --> 06:38.367
Well, what do you think, Chuck?

06:39.248 --> 06:41.231
Can we make it into Deer Creek in this plane of yours?

06:41.571 --> 06:43.134
Holy smoke, Ranger Bill.

06:43.374 --> 06:46.158
Is that the idea, to go to the fire in the helicopter?

06:46.178 --> 06:47.460
That's it, Sam.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.641
But it's really up to Chuck here.

06:49.422 --> 06:51.566
As I said, what are we waiting for?

06:51.586 --> 06:54.069
Seriously, though, Bill, I think we can make it.

06:54.089 --> 06:55.271
I don't know about the land.

06:55.391 --> 06:56.813
Well, it's worth a gamble, Chuck.

06:57.113 --> 07:01.018
I don't mind telling you we've got to get to that fire in a hurry if we're not to have a mess on our hands.

07:01.058 --> 07:02.620
I'll get the fire to us, Ranger Bill.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.402
Right, and bring that long rope, too, will you?

07:04.623 --> 07:05.924
How about the boy, Bill?

07:05.944 --> 07:06.585
Will he be all right?

07:06.886 --> 07:08.067
Don't worry about Sam, Chuck.

07:08.087 --> 07:09.028
He's as good as they come.

07:09.549 --> 07:11.852
It'll be quite an experience for him as well as for all of us.

07:12.072 --> 07:13.794
And you say that's pretty bad fire.

07:13.895 --> 07:15.677
It's been great country for a fire, eh, Bill?

07:15.717 --> 07:17.079
Well, not if we catch it quickly, Chuck.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.982
What I'm thinking about are the things at stake.

07:20.002 --> 07:21.544
A fine timber that might burn up.

07:21.584 --> 07:23.347
I've got a stake in that forest, too, Bill.

07:23.767 --> 07:25.129
The water I get from that forest.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.003
Mighty important to me.

07:27.064 --> 07:30.291
It takes only one bad fire sometimes to wipe out a watershed.

07:30.471 --> 07:32.556
You've ruined it for years.

07:32.576 --> 07:33.498
Here you are, Ranger Bill.

07:33.518 --> 07:33.939
Now, fine.

07:34.099 --> 07:39.211
Backpack pump filled with water, shovel, axe, cross-cut saw, fire rake, oh, and the rope.

07:39.471 --> 07:40.233
Just right, Sam.

07:40.353 --> 07:41.897
Now, listen to me, both of you.

07:41.917 --> 07:43.040
I'll get in the plane first.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.603
Here, let me carry some of these tools.

07:45.072 --> 07:52.641
Now watch carefully how I approach the plane, and when I get in and signal to you, you approach it in the same way, from down front and one at a time, okay?

07:52.662 --> 07:53.422
Okay, Chuck.

07:53.442 --> 07:55.365
Oh, look, Ranger, Bill, he's bent way over.

07:55.385 --> 07:58.629
Well, that's to keep clear of the main rotor, that overhead propeller.

07:58.649 --> 08:00.591
All right, Sam, Chuck is signaling to us.

08:00.611 --> 08:01.893
Go ahead.

08:01.913 --> 08:02.534
Way over now.

08:03.195 --> 08:04.156
Go in from the front.

08:04.176 --> 08:07.841
Yes, sir, I'm going.

08:07.861 --> 08:08.842
Get him back there.

08:08.862 --> 08:10.624
We'll let the range have the seat up front with me.

08:11.009 --> 08:11.610
Here he comes.

08:11.751 --> 08:12.733
Here are the rest of the tools.

08:13.194 --> 08:13.936
You all right, Sam?

08:13.956 --> 08:14.818
I think so, sir.

08:14.878 --> 08:15.900
Fasten your seatbelt, Bill.

08:15.940 --> 08:16.822
We're ready to take off.

08:17.042 --> 08:17.644
All set, Chuck.

08:19.949 --> 08:21.092
Well, we're off the ground.

08:21.132 --> 08:23.517
This plant handles our weight easily.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.239
All right, Sam.

08:24.259 --> 08:24.900
Relax.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.984
Don't have to hang on to my shoulders so hard anymore.

08:28.324 --> 08:30.988
I didn't realize I was hanging on, Ranger Bill.

08:31.008 --> 08:32.350
Gee, this is all right.

08:32.910 --> 08:35.314
Funny I didn't feel any forward motion at all.

08:35.734 --> 08:38.538
No, it's quite different from riding in an ordinary plane.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.241
Well, how long will it take us to get there, Chuck?

08:40.321 --> 08:41.583
Oh, just a matter of minutes.

08:41.603 --> 08:43.345
You watched me when I flew over before.

08:43.325 --> 08:45.749
Golly, that's something, isn't it, Ranger Bill?

08:46.009 --> 08:49.575
Compared to the time it will take our firefighting crews to get there on foot.

08:49.715 --> 08:51.397
It may make all the difference in the world.

08:51.558 --> 08:56.505
Well, if a plane can save so much time in getting to a fire, why don't they use planes more?

08:56.565 --> 08:58.148
Well, they do, Sam, in a number of places.

08:58.468 --> 09:02.735
Particularly in the mountains of the west, in the lake states, even parts of the south.

09:02.915 --> 09:05.699
I suppose you've got the smoke jumpers in mind, and regular planes.

09:05.719 --> 09:05.940
Right.

09:06.060 --> 09:06.881
Smoke jumpers?

09:06.941 --> 09:07.422
Who are they?

09:07.502 --> 09:10.647
They're firefighters, Sam, who go to forest fires by parachute.

09:10.707 --> 09:10.767
Oh!

09:11.168 --> 09:12.950
That must take a lot of courage.

09:13.191 --> 09:14.112
They're brave, all right.

09:14.512 --> 09:18.818
And as well-trained for their double job of parachuting and firefighting as any men in the world.

09:18.918 --> 09:22.903
And they do a great job of putting out fires while the fires are still small, I've heard.

09:23.184 --> 09:26.067
Smoke junkers have been in the picture for a number of years.

09:26.088 --> 09:27.610
It's the use of the helicopter that's newer.

09:28.631 --> 09:30.694
Well, there's our fire just ahead, Chuck.

09:31.354 --> 09:32.236
Can you get us any lower?

09:32.376 --> 09:34.639
We'll be okay if we don't hit any down drafts.

09:34.659 --> 09:36.802
We've been pretty lucky about the wind so far.

09:37.282 --> 09:39.105
Wind's beginning to come up, though.

09:39.125 --> 09:40.326
Just look at those treetops below.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.007
You see them move?

09:41.442 --> 09:42.464
What next, Bill?

09:42.484 --> 09:45.568
Well, I'd like to get down a little closer to the fire, Chuck.

09:45.588 --> 09:46.069
Can you make it?

09:46.089 --> 09:48.112
And then we can kind of hover over it.

09:48.432 --> 09:49.053
We'll try it.

09:49.233 --> 09:49.975
Well, that's fine, Chuck.

09:49.995 --> 09:50.535
That's fine.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.058
Just hold it there if you can.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.782
Well, the fire still can find it.

09:54.802 --> 09:55.843
Just that big old snag.

09:56.424 --> 09:56.865
Can you see it?

09:57.125 --> 09:58.267
Look, Ranger Bill.

09:58.287 --> 10:00.150
Some burning stuff just fell to the ground.

10:00.470 --> 10:02.413
Hey, it set the grass on fire.

10:02.433 --> 10:03.515
Well, we got here in time.

10:03.815 --> 10:05.197
Well, what are we going to do about it, Bill?

10:05.417 --> 10:07.160
There's no place to land anywhere close.

10:07.180 --> 10:08.121
Look out, Mr. Evans.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.483
We're going to hit a tree.

10:09.503 --> 10:09.724
Oh!

10:09.904 --> 10:09.964
Oh!

10:15.007 --> 10:16.349
Well, that was a close one, Chuck.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.492
Better stay up here a minute.

10:18.512 --> 10:19.453
What are you going to do, Bill?

10:19.794 --> 10:22.638
That fire will make headway if you don't get down there on it right away.

10:22.938 --> 10:24.000
Sam, where's that long rope?

10:24.380 --> 10:25.261
Here it is, Ranger Bill.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.384
Steve, what are you doing?

10:27.404 --> 10:30.048
Just putting some moths in it, handholds, it's all.

10:30.228 --> 10:32.552
Say, you might get down like that at that.

10:33.072 --> 10:35.396
Work down close again, Chuck, but be careful, though.

10:35.616 --> 10:37.919
There's a spot right here where the trees aren't so high.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.421
I can hold it here a bit.

10:39.601 --> 10:39.962
Oh, good.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.145
Sam, let me have the hand tools, will you?

10:42.597 --> 10:43.998
I can toss them down without hurting them.

10:44.459 --> 10:46.421
We're at about 22 feet, Bill.

10:46.441 --> 10:47.863
Well, first the axe.

10:48.223 --> 10:49.744
There she goes.

10:49.765 --> 10:50.285
Now the shovel.

10:51.687 --> 10:52.467
Now the firing.

10:53.208 --> 10:53.789
Now that does it.

10:54.670 --> 10:56.311
Now I'll just tie this rope to the seat here.

10:57.633 --> 10:59.475
Now help me on with this pump on my back, will you, Sam?

10:59.495 --> 11:01.477
That fire's beginning to go places, Ranger.

11:01.497 --> 11:04.039
Well, I think I can hold her if this just works.

11:04.060 --> 11:05.841
Sam, you stay with Chuck.

11:05.861 --> 11:06.322
No, sir.

11:06.402 --> 11:06.462
No.

11:06.695 --> 11:07.316
What's that?

11:07.877 --> 11:11.501
I'm sorry, Ranger Bill, but... Gosh, I want to go, too.

11:11.521 --> 11:12.563
Better let him go, Bill.

11:13.063 --> 11:16.648
I think you'll need him down there, and I can hold a plane on this spot.

11:16.668 --> 11:18.511
Well... Okay.

11:19.592 --> 11:20.814
I'll go first.

11:20.834 --> 11:22.316
You'll follow me when I wave to you, Sam.

11:23.037 --> 11:25.400
There may be a little drop at the end of the rope, so be careful.

11:25.861 --> 11:25.961
Okay.

11:25.981 --> 11:27.142
Teddy does it, Bill.

11:27.162 --> 11:27.743
Thanks, Chuck.

11:28.264 --> 11:29.225
I think this will work.

11:30.126 --> 11:32.569
I don't mind telling you you've helped to turn the trick today.

11:32.910 --> 11:33.951
I'll stand by for you.

11:34.832 --> 11:35.233
Well...

11:35.281 --> 11:36.883
We'll hike out after the job is done.

11:36.903 --> 11:37.564
No need to do that.

11:37.584 --> 11:38.506
You've been swell, Chuck.

11:38.746 --> 11:39.127
Okay.

11:39.587 --> 11:40.789
Slide out the door now.

11:41.270 --> 11:41.971
Good luck, Bill.

11:42.572 --> 11:43.193
Watch him, Sam.

11:43.613 --> 11:46.397
There he goes, hand over hand down the rope.

11:47.759 --> 11:48.741
He's going to let go.

11:48.781 --> 11:49.442
There!

11:49.522 --> 11:50.704
He made it, Mr. Evans.

11:50.724 --> 11:52.206
He made it fine.

11:52.226 --> 11:53.127
He's on his feet now.

11:53.147 --> 11:53.949
He's waving to us.

11:54.189 --> 11:55.931
Easy does it, Sam.

11:55.951 --> 11:57.374
Good luck, fella.

11:57.394 --> 11:57.994
Thank you, sir.

11:58.535 --> 12:00.138
Well, here I go.

12:01.099 --> 12:01.940
That's it, Sam.

12:02.842 --> 12:03.803
Slowly does it.

12:04.610 --> 12:05.311
A drop.

12:05.331 --> 12:06.012
Get your knees up.

12:07.473 --> 12:08.294
Ah, good boy.

12:09.195 --> 12:09.876
You all right, Sam?

12:10.396 --> 12:11.638
Yes, sir.

12:11.658 --> 12:13.219
A little wind knocked out of me, that's all.

12:13.660 --> 12:14.601
Fine.

12:14.661 --> 12:15.962
I've got the tools all together here.

12:16.563 --> 12:19.627
We'll wet this grass fire down first, make our fire line.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.929
Then we'll knock that old snag down and out.

12:22.810 --> 12:26.935
We'll save this watershed, boy, you and I, before the crew even has time to get here.

12:27.215 --> 12:28.196
Then you don't mind?

12:28.536 --> 12:31.039
Well, you don't mind my mutiny up there in the helicopter?

12:31.219 --> 12:31.880
Mind, Sam?

12:32.461 --> 12:33.722
I wouldn't have it any other way.

12:34.546 --> 12:35.808
Well, come on, we've got work to do.

12:36.469 --> 12:38.132
I'll use the pump and you get busy with the rake.

12:38.272 --> 12:38.833
Yes, sir.

12:39.594 --> 12:41.097
All right, you old rascal.

12:41.517 --> 12:43.120
Fire, here we come.

12:50.752 --> 12:52.555
Fire, here we come.

13:07.604 --> 13:17.717
And so, we leave Ranger Bill and Sam to finish the job at hand, the job of saving the precious forest watershed from destruction.

13:17.737 --> 13:27.790
Next week, the last one that Joe, Sam, and June will spend with Ranger Bill this summer, we'll join our friends as they enjoy a farewell dinner of barbecued steaks.

13:28.551 --> 13:35.320
There'll be some laughs and some excitement, too, as our young friends find themselves trapped by a landslide.

13:35.961 --> 13:37.122
Be sure to listen.

13:38.215 --> 13:43.183
Bill Scott, forest ranger, comes to you with a cooperation of the Forest Service, U.S.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.304
Department of Agriculture.

13:44.865 --> 13:49.873
Bill Scott is written by Bill Berghoffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokaw.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.657
Your narrator has been Al Reilly.

13:52.877 --> 14:07.159
The End

14:07.460 --> 14:09.150
Come on.
