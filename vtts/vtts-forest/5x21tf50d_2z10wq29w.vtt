WEBVTT

00:17.412 --> 00:28.582
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:28.963 --> 00:30.664
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:30.684 --> 00:32.446
That was how he got his name.

00:33.027 --> 00:33.807
Hi there, friends.

00:33.927 --> 00:35.929
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:36.510 --> 00:38.872
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:38.892 --> 00:43.056
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:44.277 --> 00:46.339
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:47.264 --> 00:51.251
That's because we kept fires from running wild through here.

00:51.271 --> 00:55.779
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:56.640 --> 01:02.650
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the Sons of the Pioneers.

01:03.632 --> 01:06.657
They came up today by way of the wagon road.

01:12.526 --> 01:18.155
Wagon wheel.

01:18.255 --> 01:22.862
Wagon wheel.

01:23.944 --> 01:27.550
Keep on a turning.

01:29.653 --> 01:34.481
Wagon wheel.

01:35.422 --> 01:39.529
Roll along.

01:40.859 --> 01:45.864
And sing your song.

01:46.905 --> 01:50.910
Carry me over.

01:52.752 --> 01:58.478
Carry me over the hill.

01:58.498 --> 02:00.220
Go long, mule.

02:00.340 --> 02:03.743
There's a steamer at the landing.

02:03.763 --> 02:07.187
Waiting for this cotton to lower.

02:08.450 --> 02:12.176
Why don't you go along, mew?

02:12.276 --> 02:14.800
A boss is understanding.

02:14.820 --> 02:21.169
There's a pasture at the end of each road.

02:21.189 --> 02:24.674
Wagon wheel.

02:24.935 --> 02:32.987
Rollin', rollin', rollin', wagon wheel.

02:33.007 --> 02:37.073
Keep on a turnin'.

02:44.157 --> 02:47.785
Roll along.

02:50.070 --> 02:55.843
Sing your song.

02:55.984 --> 03:00.073
Wagon we'll carry.

03:09.335 --> 03:20.313
Wagon wheels carry me home.

03:20.513 --> 03:27.124
Wagon wheels carry me home.

03:28.747 --> 03:29.748
Wagon wheel.

03:31.271 --> 03:33.975
Well, there's one thing about those wagon traveling days.

03:34.546 --> 03:46.198
If a fella got careless and tossed his rolled cigarette into the dried grass or leaves while it was still lit, and if it started to fire, well, he couldn't have gotten very far down the road without seeing it.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.301
It's different today.

03:49.021 --> 03:58.772
With our fine highways and high-speed cars, folks who are thoughtless or careless with their smokes have started a forest or range fire and have never known what they did.

04:00.013 --> 04:03.777
Now, I'm not trying to say that we should go back to the old horse and wagon days.

04:04.786 --> 04:11.456
What I'm getting at, of course, is that every car and truck on the road today have one or more ashtrays in them.

04:12.498 --> 04:20.010
And I'm thinking it's the duty of every American to use them in their travels, just as they do at home.

04:20.030 --> 04:23.295
Speaking of traveling, have you ever been to Dakota Land?

04:24.617 --> 04:27.281
Let me take you there.

04:27.301 --> 04:32.329
We've reached the land of desert sweet, where nothing grows for man to eat.

04:32.714 --> 04:37.960
The wind, it blows with feverish heat across the plains so hard to beat.

04:37.980 --> 04:44.287
Oh, Dakota land, sweet Dakota land, as on the fiery soil I stand.

04:44.468 --> 04:54.539
I look across the plains and wonder why it never rains till Gabriel blows his trumpet sound and says the rain's just gone around.

04:54.559 --> 04:57.102
We have no wheat, we have no oats.

04:57.284 --> 05:04.938
We have no corn to feed our shoats, our chickens are so very poor, they beg for crumbs outside the door.

05:05.438 --> 05:15.917
Oh, Dakota land, sweet Dakota land, as on thy fiery soil I stand, I look across the plains and wonder why it never rains.

05:16.218 --> 05:21.884
Till Gabriel blows his trumpet sound and says the rain's just gone around.

05:22.225 --> 05:24.467
Our horses are of bronco race.

05:24.847 --> 05:27.590
Starvation stares them in the face.

05:27.610 --> 05:29.933
We do not live, we only stay.

05:30.273 --> 05:32.596
We are too poor to get away.

05:33.056 --> 05:36.800
Oh, Dakota land, sweet Dakota land.

05:37.521 --> 05:39.784
As on that fiery soil I stand.

05:39.904 --> 05:43.828
I look across the plains and wonder why it never rains.

05:44.095 --> 05:50.562
Till Gabriel blows his trumpet sound and says the rain's just gone around.

05:53.385 --> 06:02.034
You know, friends, it's when the rain's just gone around, anywhere in this country, in the grass and leaves are dry as toast.

06:02.054 --> 06:05.798
That's when it's most dangerous to turn fire loose.

06:05.818 --> 06:13.005
And a cigarette thrown out of a moving car window, landing in fuel like that, only needs a little breeze to set a fire off.

06:14.150 --> 06:14.871
It can happen.

06:15.632 --> 06:16.333
It does happen.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.856
It's probably happening right now.

06:20.399 --> 06:21.520
I've seen it for myself.

06:23.122 --> 06:25.966
Say, the sons of the pioneers are motioning over there.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.368
I wonder what they want.

06:27.388 --> 06:32.335
Come on, folks, saddle up and join us on a little ride, or just hike along if you prefer.

06:33.096 --> 06:38.824
On foot or on horseback, now that's the way to really get close to the outdoors, the slow and easy way.

06:39.715 --> 06:45.948
Many times we've traveled down the canyons, getting off whenever we wanted to take a look around or just arrest our horses.

06:46.689 --> 06:50.998
Then we'd have a smoke, crushing the butt on a rock.

06:51.018 --> 06:56.148
You know, the last thing that we'd look at as we remounted was the rock where we'd crushed out our smoke.

06:57.010 --> 07:00.357
The sons of the pioneers have made this a habit.

07:09.601 --> 07:27.087
When chores are over at our ranch house on the plains, and all I've got to do is lay around.

07:27.353 --> 07:52.517
I saddle up my pony And go ridin' down the trail To watch the desert sun go down Ridin' down the canyon

07:53.442 --> 08:05.040
To watch the sun go down, a picture that no artist e'er could paint.

08:09.447 --> 08:19.382
Ooh, white-faced Cataloan on the mountainside.

08:19.717 --> 08:31.511
I hear a coyote whining for its mane.

08:31.531 --> 08:35.776
Cactus plants are blooming.

08:35.796 --> 08:41.023
Sagebrush everywhere.

08:41.043 --> 08:46.129
Granite spires are standing for us.

08:52.066 --> 09:14.982
you most, it's heaven to be riding down the trail when the desert sun goes down.

09:15.002 --> 09:16.605
Say, can't you just picture that?

09:17.446 --> 09:26.540
riding down the canyon with the last rays of the sun, lighting the sky with a color that's a mixture of red and gold.

09:26.560 --> 09:33.050
It's hard to believe, maybe, but you get that same kind of glow from a big forest fire.

09:33.070 --> 09:40.322
That's why we've got to be so careful with our smoking when we're outdoors, with our matches, cigarettes, and pipe ashes.

09:41.323 --> 09:45.630
We've got to stamp them out, crush them out, put them dead out.

09:46.420 --> 09:50.588
whether we're walking, riding, or however we're traveling.

09:50.608 --> 09:54.556
And another thing... Talking about traveling, Billy, now take Suge Fisher here.

09:54.596 --> 09:56.560
He's our bass-playing Romeo.

09:56.780 --> 09:58.203
He has really been around.

09:58.744 --> 10:03.874
I sure do do a lot of moving around, Lloyd, but I'll tell you one cotton-picking thing.

10:04.535 --> 10:06.819
I always use my ashtray in the car.

10:06.839 --> 10:08.783
When I'm a traveling boy, I punch out.

10:09.269 --> 10:17.008
Well, what Shug's saying is he always uses his ashtray, never tosses his matches or smokes out of the car.

10:17.489 --> 10:19.354
That's just what I said.

10:19.374 --> 10:21.279
Yeah, you sure did.

10:21.299 --> 10:23.464
Now, now go to traveling, Don Juan.

10:31.966 --> 10:36.153
Don Juan, he's a gentleman from Mexico.

10:36.954 --> 10:40.720
Don Juan has to moot your way to Romeo.

10:40.740 --> 10:45.568
He sets a senorita's heart to flame across the Rio Grande.

10:45.588 --> 10:49.174
He has a manner that the pretty dark-eyed gals can understand.

10:50.656 --> 10:54.683
I'm a hot tamale from old Mexico, just a senorita's dream.

10:54.899 --> 10:58.966
On a buckskin horse, I'm a total horse, but as a lover, I am supreme.

10:59.446 --> 11:03.874
Got the cutest thing in old Mexico in my fancy store-bought clothes.

11:03.894 --> 11:06.037
Just too divine and a cut of shine.

11:06.057 --> 11:07.760
It doesn't matter where I go.

11:08.341 --> 11:15.272
Don't go!

11:15.292 --> 11:15.793
Don't go!

11:16.870 --> 11:21.016
Now, I pack a gun, but that's all in fun, cause I couldn't even hit the floor.

11:21.436 --> 11:25.362
But I'll tell you, pals, I can move the gals like they've never been moved before.

11:25.943 --> 11:29.828
And the clumsy way you court today only fills me with disgust.

11:30.289 --> 11:34.394
Why can't we, can I, as I pass them by, another maiden bites the dirt?

11:34.555 --> 11:42.085
Young Ma!

11:43.229 --> 11:47.334
Now to tell the tale on the Chisholm Trail, how I charmed the grizzly bear.

11:47.774 --> 11:51.679
She was so beguiled by my pretty smile and the way that I combed my hair.

11:52.199 --> 11:56.224
And a bobcat lay in a tree one day just to take me by surprise.

11:56.624 --> 12:00.469
She dreamed of her and began to fur when I looked into her eyeballs.

12:00.509 --> 12:04.053
Don Juan, he's a gentleman from Mexico.

12:04.894 --> 12:08.638
Don Juan, that's the Moochie Wayne Romeo.

12:08.959 --> 12:12.763
He's at the Signorita's heart to flame across the Rio Grande.

12:13.199 --> 12:18.485
He has a manner that the pretty dark-eyed gal can understand.

12:18.525 --> 12:29.538
Well, look who's coming up the trail now.

12:29.558 --> 12:34.304
Big as life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all togged out in dungarees.

12:35.105 --> 12:37.688
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

12:37.708 --> 12:42.413
He's the popular candidate, the people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:42.983 --> 12:46.613
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.678
Hello there, folks.

12:48.698 --> 12:58.765
I'm sure counting on your support in my campaign against carelessness with fire, especially the fire in lighted cigarettes, cigars, and in pipes.

12:59.150 --> 13:05.318
There's a responsibility that goes with smoking, whether you smoke indoors or outdoors.

13:05.338 --> 13:13.830
That responsibility is to make sure every time that your smoke is out, dead out, when you're through with it.

13:13.850 --> 13:15.772
Well, I'll be seeing you.

13:16.393 --> 13:17.975
And there he goes down the trail.

13:18.556 --> 13:19.497
Thank you, Smokey.

13:20.699 --> 13:23.823
Well, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:24.844 --> 13:27.688
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine trees.

13:28.478 --> 13:37.470
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:38.432 --> 13:49.908
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:50.509 --> 13:57.338
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest, woods, and range fires.

13:57.976 --> 14:06.809
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, growlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:06.889 --> 14:10.956
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:11.296 --> 14:15.482
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:16.063 --> 14:20.490
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:20.470 --> 14:34.378
He's prowlin' and the growlin' and the sit in the air He can find the fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name

14:42.475 --> 14:51.237
Oh.
