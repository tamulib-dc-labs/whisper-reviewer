00:07.000 --> 00:20.105
[Music.]

00:20.105 --> 00:28.602
The Texas Forest Service of A&M College brings you a story about barbed wire.

00:36.191 --> 00:39.395
Texas in the early days was a land of open range.

00:39.836 --> 00:41.698
Cattle roamed wherever they pleased.

00:42.168 --> 00:44.451
Fences were few and a long way apart.

00:45.193 --> 00:48.738
Oh, occasionally somebody did a little fencing.

00:48.758 --> 00:56.990
There was a cattleman in northwestern Texas who owned 10,000 head of cattle and only 320 acres of land.

00:57.010 --> 01:07.025
One day he said to his wife, Mary, them consorn cattle of ours is always hanging around the house here, and I'm getting tired of it.

01:07.426 --> 01:11.432
They seem to think they ain't another acre of land around here to graze on.

01:11.750 --> 01:16.335
I'm going to put up a rail fence all around our property and keep them out.

01:16.355 --> 01:18.336
I won't have them bothering me.

01:18.957 --> 01:21.780
Well, that was the way most people looked on the range.

01:22.360 --> 01:27.265
And if anyone had wanted to fence the huge areas of grazing land, it would have been almost impossible.

01:27.826 --> 01:36.334
The only fences known were the rock and rail fences, and there weren't enough rocks and timber in many parts of the state to build even a fence around a house.

01:36.354 --> 01:40.238
Then in the year 1857 occurred a significant event.

01:40.707 --> 01:45.433
A Swiss named Greninger was working in the old iron foundry in Austin.

01:45.453 --> 01:50.379
He had a house with a small orchard and garden near Waller Creek.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.046
One evening, he was sitting at home on the front porch of his house when he heard a voice out in front.

01:55.066 --> 01:56.447
Hey there, Greninger.

01:56.928 --> 01:57.589
Are you home?

01:57.909 --> 01:58.430
Yeah.

01:58.830 --> 02:00.733
Come on up and sit down, Mr. Becker.

02:00.973 --> 02:02.175
I don't mind if I do.

02:02.936 --> 02:05.199
Say, I got something I want to ask you.

02:05.219 --> 02:06.600
If I can help you, I will.

02:07.121 --> 02:09.364
Well, some of the neighbors have been talking...

02:09.682 --> 02:11.705
They said something ought to be done about it.

02:12.386 --> 02:16.533
What's this about some kind of fence you've put up around your peach trees?

02:16.553 --> 02:18.697
It's a new fence I have made at the foundry.

02:19.197 --> 02:25.407
I have twisted two wires tightly together and put sharp pieces of hoop iron between the wires every few inches.

02:25.427 --> 02:30.475
It is to keep the cows from coming in and pushing down my peach trees or stepping on my watermelons.

02:30.496 --> 02:34.542
I don't see why you have to wind those pieces of sharp iron into the fence.

02:34.842 --> 02:36.904
That cuts up everybody's cows.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.408
It is the only way to teach the cows to stay out of my orchard and garden.

02:40.988 --> 02:45.072
If I did not have the bits of iron to stick them, they would go on through the fence.

02:45.273 --> 02:47.595
Well, some of the neighbors don't like it.

02:47.615 --> 02:52.040
Then, too, some of the youngsters from around here have been getting hurt on the fence.

02:52.060 --> 02:57.485
Howard Jones' youngest boy got all scratched up, not to mention getting his pants tore.

02:57.866 --> 02:59.988
Why did he have to come through the fence?

03:00.008 --> 03:00.989
Well, I don't know.

03:01.149 --> 03:02.250
I didn't ask Howard.

03:02.568 --> 03:07.172
Well, it looks as if I'll have to take down my fence and let the cows and the boys go through.

03:07.893 --> 03:09.494
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.

03:10.195 --> 03:18.142
Tell the other people that I'll take down the fence as soon as I can get... And so ended the first story of barbed wire.

03:18.162 --> 03:23.987
But in a few years, several patents were issued in the East to inventors of various kinds of barbed wire.

03:24.647 --> 03:31.393
Because Texas was a fertile field for fencing, it was to be expected that a salesman should soon appear there to sell the wire.

03:31.913 --> 03:32.414
H.B.

03:32.474 --> 03:37.320
Sanborn, representing the two partners Joseph F. Glidden and I.L.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.225
Elwood, was probably the first barbed wire agent to come to Texas.

03:41.826 --> 03:45.791
John W. Gates was also credited with being an early barbed wire salesman.

03:46.531 --> 03:53.280
Many of the Texas people were skeptical of this new invention, and sometimes they had to be convinced it would work.

03:54.340 --> 03:59.591
I forgot to tell you, Pete, there's a drummer's come to town to sell some newfangled fencing wire.

04:00.052 --> 04:00.874
Did you hear about it?

04:00.974 --> 04:01.676
No, I didn't.

04:01.696 --> 04:03.319
I just come to town.

04:03.680 --> 04:07.107
Well, he has, and he's trying to show how good it is.

04:07.127 --> 04:11.657
He's got a fence corral he made out of some of this here wire down at the fur end of town.

04:11.637 --> 04:14.040
You're gonna put some longhorns in it pretty soon.

04:14.441 --> 04:15.983
Wanna go down and have a laugh at it?

04:16.163 --> 04:16.984
I sure do.

04:17.505 --> 04:18.346
Which way'd they go?

04:18.366 --> 04:18.967
Down this way?

04:19.127 --> 04:21.470
Yeah, yeah, it's just down here and around the corner.

04:21.490 --> 04:25.956
Oh, any fool ought to know that a critter can't be stopped by a couple of strands of wire.

04:26.677 --> 04:31.083
Boy, I've seen a steer tear right through the side of a wood corral like it wasn't even there.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.248
Oh, trust some city drummer to come in with a fool notion like that.

04:35.465 --> 04:38.992
Yeah, I reckon he's got the idea that these here are tame cows.

04:39.573 --> 04:44.963
It might stop the milk cows they raise up east, but not the sort of beef we got around this country.

04:44.983 --> 04:50.132
He had some of the ranchers around here get a hold of 25 of the wildest critters they could find.

04:50.152 --> 04:51.034
Hey, there they are now.

04:51.214 --> 04:53.218
They're just herding the cows in the gate of the corral.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.688
Them cattle are a wild-looking bunch, all right.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.431
Look at that drummer over there in a derby hat.

05:02.233 --> 05:03.575
He's getting ready to start them running.

05:04.336 --> 05:07.561
But the steers are only making a little pass at the fence this time.

05:07.581 --> 05:09.764
Hey, did you see that red spotted one?

05:09.785 --> 05:13.030
He got his nose stuck with some of those little stickers in the wire that time.

05:13.831 --> 05:15.013
Oh, they're getting mad now.

05:15.453 --> 05:16.956
Hey, watch them go right through it this time.

05:17.577 --> 05:18.899
Uh-oh, they're heading for it now.

05:19.339 --> 05:21.262
They're going to trump that fence right down.

05:23.286 --> 05:25.329
Well, I'll be doggone.

05:26.290 --> 05:27.392
It stopped them.

05:27.929 --> 05:29.491
stuffed them dead in a mackerel.

05:30.412 --> 05:38.180
Two measly strands of war with some stickers on it.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.062
Yes, it stopped the cattle all right.

05:40.483 --> 05:45.288
More and more of the ranchers began buying the new wire to fence in pastures.

05:45.308 --> 05:50.954
It was one way to improve the grade of cattle by keeping scrubby stray cattle away from the herd.

05:50.974 --> 05:54.779
The wire held cattle to their own range so they were more easily found.

05:55.740 --> 05:57.902
But something else came with the fence.

05:58.237 --> 06:00.901
The fence cutter and trouble.

06:04.506 --> 06:09.272
When a man fenced land in, he fenced everybody else out.

06:09.292 --> 06:12.677
Men had taken it for granted that the range was free to everyone.

06:13.238 --> 06:17.183
Nobody had worried much about who owned the land he had been using to graze his cattle.

06:18.084 --> 06:20.768
Now the fences were tightening in the open range.

06:21.372 --> 06:24.698
Some of the ranchers refused to submit to this new practice.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.945
Cowboys saw their jobs vanishing if wire fence were used to control the herds.

06:29.687 --> 06:34.535
So, men began riding at night to cut their neighbor's fences.

06:34.555 --> 06:35.898
Neighbor turned against neighbor.

06:36.419 --> 06:38.622
Friend turned against friend.

06:38.642 --> 06:44.072
All over Texas flared up a series of feuds known as the Fence-Cutting War.

06:48.322 --> 06:54.189
Say, Harry, did you hear that Bill Manners of the Diamond A is a-looking for Joe Stevens of the Y Bar?

06:54.709 --> 06:55.410
Is that so?

06:55.671 --> 06:56.672
What happened, George?

06:57.212 --> 07:00.777
Well, I hear that Joe cut the Diamond A's new barbed wire fence.

07:01.337 --> 07:09.667
Joe claimed that he needed water for his stock, and Bill Manners of the Diamond A had built the fence all around the water hole so Joe's cattle couldn't get to it.

07:10.208 --> 07:13.992
Well, does Bill Manners really own all that land he's got fenced in?

07:14.309 --> 07:15.191
Well, I don't know.

07:15.331 --> 07:16.413
He claims he does.

07:16.894 --> 07:20.580
Of course, he might have included a little land on top of what he's paid for.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.004
Anyway, the water hole's in the middle of it.

07:23.365 --> 07:28.174
Joe Stevens been using that hole quite a few times for watering his stock, hasn't he?

07:28.695 --> 07:30.057
Yep, he has, Harry.

07:30.391 --> 07:38.946
He's got a waterhole all his own, but it dries up pretty frequent, and he's been in the habit of herding his stock over to the waterhole with a diamond A whenever he needed it.

07:39.547 --> 07:44.897
Now, Bill Manners has fenced in his place because he says he's trying to improve the grade of his stock.

07:44.917 --> 07:48.383
Yeah, I knew he'd shipped in some of that blooded stock.

07:48.937 --> 08:04.414
Well, now, what made Bill Manor especially mad was that when Joe Stevens and his Y-Bar boys cut the fence and turned their cows into the water hole, they stampeded that blooded stalk of Bill's, and now it's scattered from here to breakfast all over the country.

08:04.434 --> 08:10.560
And on top of it, Joe's boys set fire to a lot of Bill's fence posts, and you know how hard posts are to get around here.

08:11.041 --> 08:14.344
Well, George, I reckon you can't blame him for being some mad.

08:14.604 --> 08:17.087
There's been a lot of fence cutting around here lately.

08:17.422 --> 08:20.226
Some rightly and some wrongly, I guess.

08:20.887 --> 08:24.953
I think some of these fence cutters do it out of just plain meanness, too.

08:24.974 --> 08:28.479
Yeah, at least Joe Stevens thought he was in the right, though.

08:28.940 --> 08:32.184
But some of the night riders cut fences out of pure cussedness.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.409
And a lot of them are getting organized now in the bands.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.093
Those are the ones I think something should be done about.

08:38.514 --> 08:43.041
Yeah, I heard a Texas Ranger give a description of that kind of fence cutter.

08:43.645 --> 08:50.252
He said a fence cutter is a fellow who spends his time raising a few cattle and a whole lot of disturbance.

08:50.933 --> 08:57.160
He spends so much time attending sidewalk conventions that he doesn't have any time to fix up his home.

08:57.180 --> 09:02.646
He said some of the landowners are abused for wanting to do as they please with their own land.

09:02.666 --> 09:07.070
But a fence cutter's idea of liberty is to do as he pleases with his neighbor's land.

09:08.452 --> 09:09.433
That's pretty good.

09:09.970 --> 09:13.295
Well, I reckon Joe Stevens ain't a typical fence cutter.

09:13.776 --> 09:16.521
He probably did have some reason for what he done.

09:16.741 --> 09:17.222
Yeah.

09:17.823 --> 09:21.890
You know, I wished we could keep him from getting into a shooting scrape over this argument.

09:22.671 --> 09:24.935
Say, there comes Bill Manners now.

09:25.696 --> 09:27.178
Howdy, boys.

09:27.198 --> 09:28.240
Why, howdy, Bill.

09:28.400 --> 09:28.861
Howdy.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.165
Seen Joe Stevens in town?

09:31.846 --> 09:32.908
Why, no, Bill.

09:32.948 --> 09:33.008
No.

09:33.578 --> 09:35.761
But why don't you settle your fuss peaceable?

09:36.341 --> 09:37.983
Have a drink with us and take it easy.

09:38.524 --> 09:40.146
No, thanks, boys.

09:40.166 --> 09:44.390
There's one way to settle a fence cutter, and I figure on taking him easy.

09:44.411 --> 09:46.693
He's carried nippers for the last time.

09:46.713 --> 09:48.395
I hate to see you do this, Bill.

09:48.996 --> 09:50.317
Well, so long, boys.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.461
Think I'll take a look for him over at the livery stable.

09:54.182 --> 09:55.023
So long, Bill.

09:55.744 --> 09:58.387
You know, Harry, he's gonna run into trouble, all right.

09:58.867 --> 10:02.291
I think I saw Joe Stevens going into the livery stable a while back.

10:02.752 --> 10:03.012
Yep.

10:03.413 --> 10:04.955
Barriers are coming out there now.

10:06.036 --> 10:07.257
All right, fence cutter.

10:07.678 --> 10:09.339
Go for your gun.

10:12.423 --> 10:13.524
I'll be a son of a gun.

10:14.184 --> 10:14.965
Look at that, will you?

10:16.287 --> 10:16.647
Hmm.

10:17.548 --> 10:19.470
Reckon they both lost that argument.

10:27.499 --> 10:30.822
The war between the fence builders and the fence cutters continued.

10:31.291 --> 10:39.743
The fence builders said they wanted to build up their herds and protect them from cattle thieves, and they said the fence cutters couldn't bear to see someone else own property.

10:40.404 --> 10:47.954
The fence cutters, on the other hand, claimed that many ranchers were fencing in roads, water holes, and lands which didn't belong to them.

10:48.675 --> 10:55.966
Fence cutting became so common that there were organizations of men who claimed that they would cut every fence in the state.

10:55.986 --> 11:00.572
A correspondent from Brown County reported that the fence troubles in that county had ceased,

11:00.923 --> 11:03.830
because there were no more fences left in the county to be cut.

11:04.693 --> 11:11.510
In many sections, business was almost stopped, and investors of capital were frightened away from Texas.

11:11.530 --> 11:13.355
Immigration to the state nearly stopped.

11:14.077 --> 11:14.578
Then...

11:14.963 --> 11:23.797
One day in the year 1884, newspaper editor Tom Berry came running into Steve Pierce's general merchandise store.

11:23.817 --> 11:27.884
Hey, Steve, I just got news that they passed the law down at Austin against fence cutting.

11:27.944 --> 11:28.424
That's so?

11:28.725 --> 11:29.366
When did you hear it?

11:29.746 --> 11:30.147
Just now.

11:30.187 --> 11:31.970
I thought I'd run over and tell you about it.

11:32.030 --> 11:33.713
I've got to go back and write it up for the tribute.

11:33.913 --> 11:35.115
What's the law say?

11:35.095 --> 11:42.265
Well, it makes fence-cutting a felony instead of a misdemeanor, and it says that you have to put a gate every three miles in a fence.

11:42.285 --> 11:46.791
Then, too, it says you can't fence land unless you own or lease it, and you can't obstruct public roads.

11:46.992 --> 11:49.555
I reckon it's a good thing they finally passed a law like that.

11:49.956 --> 11:51.939
It should stop a lot of the scrapping around here.

11:52.339 --> 11:52.599
Yeah.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.204
Well, I've got to go over and set this up in type so it'll be in tonight's paper.

11:56.365 --> 11:56.845
See you later.

11:57.426 --> 12:01.592
Oh, by the way, I guess this will probably increase your sales of barbed wire...

12:09.402 --> 12:15.711
And so ends the story of the Texas fence-cutting war and the early days of barbed wire.

12:16.512 --> 12:21.739
Fence-cutting gradually died out except in a few sections where it continued for a number of years.

12:22.500 --> 12:30.231
Today, barbed wire fences and the more recent woven wire fences are a familiar sight in almost every part of Texas.

12:30.251 --> 12:34.737
Thousands upon thousands of miles of fence stretch across the state.

12:34.757 --> 12:36.760
Wire fence needs fence posts.

12:37.060 --> 12:46.800
Mesquite and cedar posts in West Texas, Post Oaks and Bodark in Central Texas, pine and hardwoods in East Texas are used to support the fences.

12:46.820 --> 12:49.045
Millions of fence posts are in use today.

12:49.413 --> 12:58.244
Thousands of Texas farmers produce fence posts for use on their own farms and ranches and for sale throughout the state, adding to their income.

12:58.945 --> 13:02.850
Ten million fence posts are cut each year from our East Texas forests.

13:03.310 --> 13:06.574
Millions more come from our other timber regions.

13:06.594 --> 13:10.459
The sale of these posts means income to many farmers

13:10.810 --> 13:22.062
wages to the people who cut and haul them.

13:22.082 --> 13:35.417
A constant supply of timber can build a greater Texas.

13:40.342 --> 13:45.227
