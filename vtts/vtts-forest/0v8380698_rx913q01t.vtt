00:05.595 --> 00:35.097
[Music.]

00:35.097 --> 00:39.382
Thank you, boys, thank you.

00:39.603 --> 00:41.225
Howdy friends, how y'all?

00:41.245 --> 00:43.928
Yes, sir, by George, here it is, the old wood rider again.

00:43.968 --> 00:48.594
Jelly Elliott, you guessed it, that's it, and the three knotheads, the knotiest of knotheads.

00:49.835 --> 00:53.880
Yes, sir, we're sitting here on the big old pine tree, friends, just having a big time.

00:54.381 --> 01:01.830
We want to talk to you a little bit here and yonder and about, and hither-sither and yonder, about the woods and the forest and things.

01:02.350 --> 01:11.802
And then, friends, we wanted to remind you, too, that we've come to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.625
Now, we're going to get into a tune here.

01:13.645 --> 01:16.729
I don't know anything else to do, so we're going to bring Jack.

01:18.751 --> 01:21.114
Jack, he's coming up here and playing an old hold down.

01:21.175 --> 01:22.616
You're in good tune there, Jack.

01:22.636 --> 01:24.919
That's perfect, son.

01:24.959 --> 01:25.500
That's good.

01:25.520 --> 01:25.881
That's good.

01:25.901 --> 01:26.562
Here we go.

01:26.582 --> 01:27.683
Cotton-eyed Joe.

01:30.481 --> 02:36.530
[Music.]

02:36.530 --> 02:39.858
Lord have mercy.

02:39.878 --> 02:41.081
Think I'm out of wind, don't you?

02:41.883 --> 02:43.066
I ain't the wind out of me.

02:43.146 --> 02:46.814
I'm telling you, that boy really made the bug for us fly there on that fiddle.

02:47.155 --> 02:48.859
That's all right there, Jack, son.

02:48.899 --> 02:51.265
Remind me to raise your wages there.

02:51.498 --> 02:52.679
Another hamburger.

02:52.699 --> 02:55.443
Yeah, I'm liable to start paying you any time.

02:55.463 --> 03:01.590
Well, friends, I just wanted to remind you, neighbors, that this is a new series here.

03:01.610 --> 03:06.195
It's about the woods, you know, and the outdoors, and the God-given woods.

03:06.215 --> 03:09.660
You know, that's something God put here for us, friends, for us to use.

03:09.700 --> 03:14.265
The streams and the lakes and the wildlife and all that sort of stuff is out there in the woods.

03:14.285 --> 03:17.929
And he intends for us to use it right and protect it.

03:17.949 --> 03:18.450
And, uh,

03:18.869 --> 03:22.033
But first, I guess I better introduce these not heads.

03:22.593 --> 03:23.815
I better do it, I reckon.

03:23.895 --> 03:28.080
I'm going to start with this fine-looking young man over there on the steel guitar.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.823
I'm telling you, that boy plays a mess of guitar.

03:30.843 --> 03:39.793
He's got a whole lap full of guitar there, and when we can get him to play loud enough, it sounds fairly well, but half the time he can't hear.

03:39.813 --> 03:41.195
Oh, he's a fine boy, though.

03:41.235 --> 03:42.056
He's a fine boy.

03:42.276 --> 03:44.439
He's the only boy his mama's got named Herman.

03:44.679 --> 03:45.820
Herman plays the steel.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.581
Herman?

03:48.991 --> 03:51.154
Was that a call?

03:51.174 --> 03:52.756
Ain't that awful, I'm telling you.

03:52.776 --> 03:53.918
Oh, well, that's all right.

03:53.958 --> 03:54.839
Good for you, Herman.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.221
He'll do better next time, friends.

03:56.241 --> 03:56.762
Bear with him.

03:56.782 --> 03:57.583
He's just learning.

03:58.144 --> 03:58.805
And let's see.

03:58.825 --> 03:59.726
We've got Jack over here.

03:59.746 --> 04:00.567
Jack plays a fiddle.

04:00.587 --> 04:03.091
Now, Jack has won a lot of championships.

04:03.111 --> 04:06.896
He won the Southern Championship for hold-down fiddle playing, friends.

04:06.916 --> 04:09.019
And I think Jack is a fine fiddle player.

04:09.039 --> 04:11.603
And I believe if you'll stay tuned, you'll find out for yourself.

04:11.623 --> 04:12.624
It's Jack Youngblood.

04:12.645 --> 04:16.770
Give us a chord on that fiddle, Jack.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.952
Oh, Lord.

04:18.404 --> 04:21.449
I declare it looks like I'm going to have to feed these boys in spite of everything.

04:22.130 --> 04:25.897
And then we have here, we have a poet.

04:26.097 --> 04:27.660
He's good at poetry.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.303
He got two flowers and a hint.

04:29.583 --> 04:30.465
Oh, no, that ain't right.

04:30.485 --> 04:31.286
He writes poetry.

04:31.326 --> 04:32.148
That's what it is, yeah.

04:32.408 --> 04:35.313
Yeah, he plays the guitar, the starvation box.

04:35.333 --> 04:41.003
He sings, he yodels, he runs foot races, and he kind of raveled at the end.

04:41.219 --> 04:44.505
But he sings pretty fair, and he writes poetry.

04:44.525 --> 04:46.208
And we're liable to let him write.

04:46.248 --> 04:47.731
No, I ain't gonna let you say nothing today.

04:47.771 --> 04:49.474
No, no, you ain't gonna say no poetry today.

04:49.494 --> 04:50.736
No, no, not today, Lewis.

04:50.756 --> 04:52.179
Maybe in the next program.

04:52.239 --> 04:53.822
I might let you do something on the next program.

04:53.842 --> 04:54.563
You can't ever tell.

04:54.864 --> 04:56.026
Lewis writes a lot of poetry.

04:56.306 --> 04:57.689
Then that is Lewis Millett.

04:57.729 --> 04:59.532
Give us a card on that guitar.

04:59.512 --> 05:08.705
Here's a tune here, let's play a tune, what y'all say?

05:08.725 --> 05:15.936
You know, I got a friend, a boy that's not even in this country, he's a good friend of mine, and I want to tell you about him, but first we better play a tune here.

05:15.976 --> 05:18.059
We're going to do a tune, I'm going to try to sing it, friend.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.803
Don't hold this against me, it hurts me worse than it does you.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.427
It's a little ditty called A Phrase.

05:34.105 --> 06:00.366
How much I care Afraid I'll need you And you won't be there I'd love to take you Into my heart But something tells me We would only part

06:00.346 --> 06:07.113
I loved them all, just one love for gold.

06:08.915 --> 06:14.962
I paid the call, and it hurt me so.

06:14.982 --> 06:22.910
A heart gets careless when vows are made.

06:22.930 --> 06:25.493
I want to love you.

06:27.886 --> 06:32.091
But I'm so afraid.

07:03.256 --> 07:09.845
I love too long, just one love ago.

07:11.447 --> 07:18.978
I paid the cost, and it hurts me so.

07:18.998 --> 07:27.269
A heart gets careless when vows are made.

07:27.290 --> 07:31.255
I want to love you, but I'm so

07:36.837 --> 07:38.579
Thank you, boys.

07:38.599 --> 07:39.099
Thank you.

07:39.119 --> 07:39.780
There it is, friend.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.001
That's the best I can do.

07:41.021 --> 07:41.522
I'm scared.

07:41.542 --> 07:41.922
I'm afraid.

07:41.942 --> 07:42.543
That's me?

07:43.083 --> 07:43.584
Scared.

07:44.044 --> 07:47.167
Friends, I wanted to tell you about my buddy there, Tom, friend of mine.

07:47.187 --> 07:49.970
Tom, now, as I told you, he's over yonder.

07:50.010 --> 07:52.532
He's across the ocean over there.

07:52.552 --> 07:54.334
But you know, I get a lot of letters from Tom.

07:54.955 --> 07:57.277
I get a lot of letters from him from time to time.

07:57.297 --> 08:05.545
And every letter I get from him, every letter, he keeps talking about the woods back home, wishing he could be back here with me hunting and fishing.

08:05.963 --> 08:13.692
hoping that nobody's been careless with the fire in his neck of the woods and around his favorite fishing hole and streams and things.

08:13.712 --> 08:19.298
You know, Tom and me spent lots of time in the woods and on the creek bank fishing and all that sort of stuff.

08:19.839 --> 08:22.582
And, well, he's a fine boy.

08:22.602 --> 08:23.423
Tom's a good boy.

08:24.804 --> 08:28.208
He tells me in some of his letters, friends, you'd be surprised that every time

08:28.660 --> 08:29.801
I get a letter from him.

08:29.821 --> 08:40.173
He tells me about new shipments of supplies coming in from the state and how he kind of goes over there and pats on the wooden crates that this stuff is nailed up in, you know.

08:41.855 --> 08:42.937
That's something to think about.

08:43.858 --> 08:47.482
He sort of touches them, you know, and he says it's just got the touch of home.

08:48.183 --> 08:50.886
And he knows that comes from back home.

08:50.906 --> 08:54.510
Well, the same thing with his rifle stock there, too.

08:54.550 --> 08:55.191
He says he...

08:55.593 --> 09:03.341
Kind of likes to snuggle it up against his cheek because he knows just what the tree looks like that that rifle stock is made from.

09:03.361 --> 09:09.208
And, friends, I'm doing my best to keep Tom's wood safe for him when he comes back.

09:09.348 --> 09:16.676
And just like he's doing in his own way, he's trying to keep us safe and everything over here.

09:17.577 --> 09:19.459
And bye, George, friends.

09:19.479 --> 09:24.064
We just got to all put in together and help Tom along with all the other Toms to have us.

09:24.635 --> 09:28.519
some place to come back here to fish and hunt and everything.

09:28.539 --> 09:37.267
I hope everybody realizes just how much that our forests and woods mean to our men across the ocean over there.

09:38.108 --> 09:44.053
Friends, did you know, did you know that it takes about 500,000 trees a year?

09:44.313 --> 09:50.499
Now get this right, it takes about 500,000 trees a year to make the rifle stocks.

09:50.619 --> 09:51.300
It's Tom and

09:51.618 --> 09:54.202
them boys is using over that.

09:54.222 --> 09:55.324
Well, it does.

09:55.344 --> 10:02.174
And another thing, it takes a quart of pulpwood for every 90,000 rounds of ammunition that them boys use.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.161
And another thing, friends, here's something else maybe you didn't know.

10:06.761 --> 10:12.310
To create one airplane, now mind you, to create one airplane, it takes about 10 big trees.

10:13.268 --> 10:16.874
Oh, friends, we've got to take care of these woods and forests and things.

10:17.014 --> 10:18.136
We've just got to take care of them.

10:18.156 --> 10:18.616
We need them.

10:19.097 --> 10:20.800
You know it, and I know it.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.122
Let's all get together.

10:22.142 --> 10:22.562
We can do it.

10:22.763 --> 10:23.544
Here's another tune.

10:23.604 --> 10:24.205
Features Herman.

10:24.225 --> 10:24.545
Yes, sir.

10:24.566 --> 10:27.630
Herman on his double-belly children's steel guitar there.

10:27.650 --> 10:40.390
It's a little thing called Steel in the Blues.

12:26.227 --> 12:45.938
All right, Ted.

12:47.962 --> 12:49.584
That was mighty fine there, Herman.

12:49.945 --> 12:51.407
We hope everybody enjoyed it.

12:52.096 --> 12:57.124
Friends, you know we're about to run out of time here, and the boys and myself sitting here on this old pine tree, we're going to have to shove off.

12:57.144 --> 13:01.811
We'll saddle up our stick horses and move along and get along down the trail.

13:01.832 --> 13:10.666
But before I go, friends, there's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you here, and I'd like for you to take it seriously and study it over.

13:11.427 --> 13:14.912
For there are bullets, supply crates, and rifle butts.

13:14.932 --> 13:16.435
Our men depend on the wood.

13:17.316 --> 13:19.740
So be careful with fire whenever you're out.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.484
You'll be helping deliver the good.

13:23.586 --> 13:29.779
Well, friends, there it is.

13:29.899 --> 13:35.610
It kind of winds up our intercession with you.

13:35.631 --> 13:38.877
We've enjoyed being with you, and we hope that you've enjoyed being with us.

13:39.346 --> 13:42.310
Friends, we'd like to have you tune us in again sometime.

13:42.330 --> 13:43.873
You'll listen to their local announcer.

13:43.893 --> 13:45.756
He'll let you know when we'll be back.

13:45.796 --> 13:59.897
We'd like to remind you again, too, maybe, that this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own state forest service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:59.917 --> 14:04.003
Remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fire.

14:04.003 --> 14:44.562
[Music.]

14:44.562 --> 15:20.000
[Silence.]
