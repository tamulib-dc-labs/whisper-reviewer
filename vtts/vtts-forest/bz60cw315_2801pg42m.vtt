WEBVTT

00:21.158 --> 00:22.422
Well, howdy, friends.

00:22.442 --> 00:23.104
How are y'all?

00:25.251 --> 00:27.699
We'd like to come in and visit with you there for a little while.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.666
If you ain't doing nothing, ain't too busy.

00:30.488 --> 00:34.662
We're just sitting here on the old pine tree down by the trail here.

00:34.979 --> 00:37.463
And we'd sure like to come in this way.

00:37.483 --> 00:40.528
Or better still, you just come on down the trail and visit with us.

00:41.409 --> 00:45.216
Yeah, we got a big pot of old country coffee here made out here in the woods.

00:45.516 --> 00:47.880
We're going to be with you for 14 and a half minutes.

00:47.900 --> 00:53.409
Brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's forestry service.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.294
We're going to start things off here with Robert.

00:56.594 --> 00:58.237
Robert and his strata potato fiddle.

00:59.319 --> 01:01.442
That ain't a violin, is it?

01:02.232 --> 01:04.807
Well, I used to play a corn song fiddle.

01:05.028 --> 01:09.171
Here we go, Robert playing Barrick Creek Hall.

02:21.950 --> 02:25.194
Well, thank you, Robert.

02:25.214 --> 02:26.276
Thank you a whole lot there.

02:26.556 --> 02:31.242
Friends, that was Robert Shivers, the one and only Robert Shivers doing the Bear Creek Talk.

02:31.262 --> 02:31.562
Bear.

02:32.103 --> 02:33.225
You know, that can remind me of something.

02:33.245 --> 02:33.485
Bear.

02:35.267 --> 02:37.951
Friends, have you ever met that character, Smokey Bear?

02:38.632 --> 02:39.272
Smokey Bear.

02:40.574 --> 02:42.937
Ah, boy, that's some character, that Smokey Bear.

02:43.298 --> 02:49.746
He's all dressed up with pants and a forest ranger's hat on top of his head and...

02:50.182 --> 02:53.366
Boy, that's a forest fire prevention bear.

02:54.267 --> 02:55.429
You know how that got started?

02:55.469 --> 02:56.610
I'm going to tell you how it got started.

02:56.931 --> 02:58.212
I'm going to tell you just how it got started.

02:58.933 --> 03:01.296
And I know how it got started.

03:01.677 --> 03:02.998
Now, you may not believe this.

03:03.018 --> 03:05.001
It sounds like one of them fish tales, you know.

03:05.241 --> 03:06.303
You always lose a basin.

03:06.543 --> 03:08.806
But this is the truth.

03:08.826 --> 03:14.914
Old Smokey Bear, that Smokey Bear, he helped out in this forest fire business.

03:15.514 --> 03:16.816
It happened several years ago.

03:17.837 --> 03:19.159
Several years back there.

03:19.342 --> 03:24.109
There was a big fire just carrying on and ranging there on the hills and the hills.

03:24.710 --> 03:28.335
And there's about 200 men out there fighting that fire.

03:29.016 --> 03:31.280
Well, they got up there on a stretch along the ridge.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.783
This was in the mountain country there.

03:33.803 --> 03:40.253
And they got up there on the side of one of them young mountains, hills, some people call them, young mountains, I call them.

03:40.418 --> 03:44.943
They got on up there, and they just couldn't hold that fire nowhere.

03:44.963 --> 03:49.728
It just had them whipped, and they had fought till their tongues was hanging out down to their belt line.

03:50.589 --> 03:51.930
Boy, the chances were slim.

03:52.991 --> 03:55.193
I'm telling you, they didn't have much chance for that fire.

03:55.794 --> 03:58.297
Time was short, and the fire was rolling plenty fast.

03:59.818 --> 04:07.927
And the best fire boss they had and the best crew they had, they sent them up on the ridge, and they was ready up there to do or die.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.328
And if they lost that fire,

04:09.713 --> 04:13.077
Boy, I'm telling you, they just didn't know what to do.

04:13.517 --> 04:16.020
They wasn't going to catch up for a long while.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.561
Now that's the kind of country it was.

04:17.742 --> 04:28.833
When they finally sweated up on top of them hills up there and got up there, them firefighters and the firefighter boss there and all, they got up there, they found some four-legged firefighters.

04:28.853 --> 04:31.096
Boy, that was a big bear country up there.

04:31.116 --> 04:34.439
It was up in them hills, you know, them mountains and all, lots of bear up there.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.902
When they got up there, they found a bear trail.

04:37.473 --> 04:40.437
Boy, it was a mile and a half long, right up to the side of that ridge.

04:40.917 --> 04:43.721
And when they went up there, you know what they found, friends?

04:43.741 --> 04:48.847
They found a bunch of bear up there, and them bear was going and coming just as fast as they could.

04:48.867 --> 04:55.555
They was going down to the side of that little mountain creek there and wetting their feet and coming back up there and walking up and down that trail.

04:55.575 --> 05:00.682
And if it hadn't been to them bear, well, they ain't no telling where that fire went.

05:01.062 --> 05:01.843
Just ain't no telling.

05:02.515 --> 05:08.843
Yeah, them bears would go down to the water hole and wet their feet, and here they'd come, right back up the trail, just up paddling back and forth up and down that trail.

05:10.224 --> 05:10.965
Boy, that's something.

05:11.626 --> 05:17.673
Now, that was enough to let them forestry boys set a backfire and stop that fire.

05:18.614 --> 05:22.719
Now, them bears saved the day, and that's where Smokey Bear come in.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.401
That's how they got acquainted with Smokey Bear.

05:24.702 --> 05:26.023
And they thought enough of him, friends.

05:26.043 --> 05:26.764
They thought enough of him.

05:26.784 --> 05:27.465
They got a nightie.

05:28.226 --> 05:29.147
So they dressed him up.

05:29.431 --> 05:39.068
They just dressed him up in a suit and put one of them firefighters, them forestry boys' hats on him, and that's the program, to cut down woods fires.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.190
Say, what am I talking about?

05:40.210 --> 05:42.294
That's what I'm up here for.

05:42.334 --> 05:46.782
That's what we, that's us, ain't it, to prevent woods fires.

05:47.167 --> 05:48.710
Well, that's how the story got started.

05:48.931 --> 05:49.772
Here's the next tune.

05:50.053 --> 05:54.602
Here's the next tune, and I believe Slim's going to sing this next tune.

05:54.642 --> 06:08.010
He's going to sing one of them love songs, and the name of it is I Loved and Lost.

06:17.170 --> 06:27.082
I've loved and loved, I'm sad and blue.

06:27.102 --> 06:36.955
I've paid the call for loving you.

06:36.975 --> 06:44.224
Someday I know the tide will turn.

06:45.402 --> 07:09.486
And you will learn You've loved and loved Something always happens When you don't play the game on the square You'll find your heart is breaking

07:10.158 --> 07:33.415
And your lover won't be there I've tried so hard But all in vain I loved and loved But I'm not to blame

07:33.935 --> 07:35.917
Thank you, Slim, I loved and lost.

07:35.937 --> 07:54.957
Friends, this Smokey Bear deal here that I was telling you about, that little old bear with the forestry pants on and the hat on top of his head there, you'll see him in the post offices and you'll see him in the railroad stations and you'll see him on posters and signs throughout the country.

07:54.977 --> 07:56.879
Yeah, and you'll see him in streetcars.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.423
You'll see Smokey Bear all about, hither, thither, and yon.

08:01.084 --> 08:02.305
Now, Smokey Bear...

08:02.875 --> 08:06.239
is used in helping prevent forest fires.

08:06.259 --> 08:06.900
And so are we.

08:07.901 --> 08:10.023
That's what we're here for.

08:10.043 --> 08:16.931
To try to get the subject over to help prevent woods fires.

08:17.051 --> 08:17.832
Yeah, that's right.

08:18.233 --> 08:30.807
And Smokey Bear, along with us, is just to sort of help you to remember, to break your matches in two, to be sure they're out, to put out their camp fires, warming fires, and all that sort of stuff.

08:31.597 --> 08:33.520
Brush fires and everything.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.703
Be careful, friends.

08:35.083 --> 08:36.686
I'm telling you, that's terrible.

08:36.846 --> 08:39.551
Let the woods burn off there and burn off all the young terminators.

08:39.571 --> 08:40.733
Let's play another tune here.

08:40.774 --> 08:41.976
I believe we'll get Robert.

08:41.996 --> 08:47.045
Robert, the boy, plays a fiddle to come up here and play a little bit on a fiddle and sing a little dab, dab, and have two dabs.

08:47.526 --> 08:50.431
And what have you chosen for today, son?

08:50.451 --> 08:52.074
Oh, yeah, that's a thing.

08:52.134 --> 08:53.396
But we got to leave anyhow.

08:53.416 --> 08:56.001
But Robert says, please don't leave me.

09:01.077 --> 09:19.923
Please don't leave me anymore, darling Partings are so sad, my dear You're the only one that I love, darling Can't you tell that I'm sincere?

09:20.184 --> 09:24.570
We were happy once, my dear Happy as could be

09:24.550 --> 09:33.862
Now that we have things matched up, just stay here with me and love me as you did before.

09:34.102 --> 09:36.905
For I'm so in love with you.

09:38.487 --> 09:39.929
Thank you, Robert.

09:39.949 --> 09:40.249
Thank you.

09:40.269 --> 09:40.710
There it is.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.312
Please don't leave me, darling.

09:42.933 --> 09:44.475
Robert Shivers doing the vocal line.

09:44.835 --> 09:49.821
Friends, you know, I just come back from the stock show, big stock show.

09:49.921 --> 09:52.785
Boy, I really had a swell trip.

09:53.255 --> 09:55.597
I really had a big time, too.

09:56.018 --> 09:58.060
I'm just all pepped up over it.

09:58.140 --> 10:03.245
I think I'm going to go back home there on that old poor farm and start all over again.

10:03.265 --> 10:09.431
Boy, I never saw so many fine cows and stuff, stock.

10:09.551 --> 10:11.633
Boy, they had them out there.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.255
Man, I'm telling you, it's really something.

10:14.315 --> 10:22.283
And I got around there and got to visiting there with them old boys that raised them fine cows and yearlings and things and got to talking to them.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.027
There was one or two there that I knew.

10:25.307 --> 10:26.749
I used to know them a long time ago.

10:27.471 --> 10:33.119
And I asked them, when I used to know them, they were just old poor boys like myself.

10:33.179 --> 10:42.153
They were just living from one day to the next and had a few old poor scony cows running out there in the woods and they didn't have a dime.

10:42.173 --> 10:46.380
And boy, they was driving good cars and dressed nice and

10:46.748 --> 10:48.950
Why, their kids even had on shoes.

10:49.190 --> 10:49.911
That's the truth.

10:50.351 --> 10:50.752
They did.

10:50.792 --> 10:51.753
Their kids had on shoes.

10:51.793 --> 10:55.796
I asked them, I said, boy, where in the world did you get in all the money?

10:55.836 --> 10:58.519
They strike oil on your place or something?

10:58.539 --> 11:00.721
And, boy, they told me.

11:00.741 --> 11:06.186
They just built good pastures, and they got bloodied stock, and that was the answer to it.

11:06.907 --> 11:15.895
And I can remember the day when them same folks, every spring, spring come, yeah, boy, when spring come, you could smell grass burning in the woods because they'd burn the woods off.

11:16.313 --> 11:18.715
You know, and they said they cut out all that.

11:19.196 --> 11:23.440
And they got blooded stock, built good pastures, and kept the fire out of the pastures.

11:24.241 --> 11:27.244
And that's the result of what they got.

11:27.644 --> 11:28.926
Fine cows.

11:28.946 --> 11:30.427
Well, we're going to play another tune here.

11:30.507 --> 11:33.350
I believe, what do we got lined up here this time?

11:33.370 --> 11:34.211
Have we got a tune lined?

11:34.431 --> 11:37.614
We can do just a jerk, jerk, and have two jerks of a hoe down here, Robert.

11:37.895 --> 11:45.122
If you don't care, son, how about let's do just a little bit of ragtime and here we go.

12:00.205 --> 12:07.436
Red panel, it's on panel.

12:08.297 --> 12:13.465
My favorite thing.

12:13.485 --> 12:18.492
My favorite thing.

12:18.512 --> 12:27.005
You ought to hear me play that other thing.

12:27.025 --> 12:28.187
Boy!

12:37.786 --> 12:45.836
Thank you, Robert.

12:45.856 --> 12:46.477
Thank you.

12:46.497 --> 12:48.319
Friends, we've run plumb out of time.

12:48.379 --> 12:50.441
Plumb out of time here for today.

12:50.522 --> 12:53.645
But you listen to your announcer and he'll let you know just what day we'll be back.

12:54.246 --> 12:56.389
Yeah, and he'll tell you all about it.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.811
Write us a penny postcard or letter.

12:57.831 --> 12:59.152
We want to hear from you, friends.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.795
We just love to get that fan mail.

13:02.676 --> 13:07.202
And we enjoy sitting here under the old pine tree picking and singing these songs for you.

13:07.402 --> 13:17.055
And we hope that you get some benefit out of the few hints and things that we've told you about here pertaining to your forest and pastures and things of that kind.

13:17.075 --> 13:18.376
It's just really a fine thing.

13:19.298 --> 13:19.618
It is.

13:19.918 --> 13:20.740
That's all there is to it.

13:21.360 --> 13:27.148
I had a lot more I wanted to tell you about pastures, driving down the road and seeing nice pastures outside the road there.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.271
Nice cattle, boy, just round, slick, fat.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.554
And, boy, I mean, that guy knows his business.

13:32.574 --> 13:36.378
And another thing, he don't get out there and burn it off every spring so them cows will have a place to graze.

13:36.658 --> 13:38.600
And you better not let no fire get over in there.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.362
He'll shoot you at your tooth.

13:40.762 --> 13:44.687
Boy, he gets fighting mad if you let fire get out in his pasture.

13:45.167 --> 13:46.569
So keep that in mind, friends.

13:46.609 --> 13:47.129
Think it over.

13:47.369 --> 13:51.093
We've got to go now, but before we go, I'd just like to leave this thought for the day with you.

13:51.754 --> 13:54.597
They say a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

13:55.558 --> 13:56.359
But I say...

13:57.048 --> 14:00.812
A cow on a good pasture is worth 10 in the brush.

14:03.495 --> 14:07.200
Well, friends, we've enjoyed visiting with you today for this 14 and a half minutes.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.001
We'll be back.

14:08.341 --> 14:10.163
Just listen to the announcer and he'll let you know.

14:10.584 --> 14:13.347
Remember, friends, we'd like to have a penny postcard or a letter from you.

14:13.367 --> 14:14.488
So write to us, won't you?

14:15.349 --> 14:19.714
Remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

14:40.990 --> 14:41.518
Bye.
