00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[Silence.]

00:10.000 --> 00:26.000
[Music.]

00:26.000 --> 00:34.813
The Texas Forest Service of A&M College brings you The Trouble at the French Legation.

00:45.391 --> 00:55.285
In the year 1843, the Count Alphonso de Saligny was in Austin representing the Republic of France as charge d'affaires to the Republic of Texas.

00:55.305 --> 01:01.734
The Count lived in the French legation, the most imposing house in Austin, attended by his servant, Philippe.

01:02.536 --> 01:06.501
Philippe was also in charge of his master's stable of horses.

01:06.521 --> 01:09.846
One day, Philippe was humming a tune as he entered the stable.

01:12.138 --> 01:18.407
Qu'est-ce que c'est?

01:19.248 --> 01:20.490
What is happening here?

01:23.334 --> 01:24.135
Oh, a pig.

01:24.857 --> 01:28.422
One of the pigs have been keeping a bullock and eating our corn.

01:29.263 --> 01:29.864
Get out, pig.

01:30.244 --> 01:30.925
Alon, go.

01:32.027 --> 01:34.030
So, you will not leave?

01:35.071 --> 01:35.332
Bien.

01:36.253 --> 01:40.339
I will show you what happens to pigs who eat up the corn belonging to Monsieur de Saligny.

01:40.960 --> 01:46.346
Wait until I get my gun down from the rack and your master, the hotel keeper, can serve you at his supper table.

01:47.428 --> 01:50.391
Now, pig, you have eaten your last bite.

01:50.391 --> 02:00.503
[Music.]

02:00.503 --> 02:01.184
Hey, Philippe.

02:02.245 --> 02:03.346
Yes, Mr. Bullock?

02:03.366 --> 02:05.669
Have you seen one of my pigs up this way?

02:06.210 --> 02:07.351
A pig?

02:07.371 --> 02:08.352
Yes, a pig.

02:08.652 --> 02:13.456
John Parker said he thought he saw one of my pigs coming up the road towards the legation.

02:13.476 --> 02:13.917
Oh, yes.

02:14.257 --> 02:14.717
A pig.

02:14.998 --> 02:16.018
Well, did you see it?

02:16.719 --> 02:19.702
Yes, I... It's... Well, hurry up, man.

02:19.762 --> 02:20.522
Quit your stuttering.

02:20.562 --> 02:21.463
Where is it?

02:22.144 --> 02:23.605
I believe it's in the stable.

02:24.286 --> 02:24.806
In the stable?

02:24.846 --> 02:25.927
What's it doing in the stable?

02:26.007 --> 02:27.508
Nothing, Mr. Nothing.

02:27.528 --> 02:30.471
Well, I'll get it out of there.

02:30.491 --> 02:30.911
Yes.

02:31.572 --> 02:32.172
There it is.

02:33.093 --> 02:35.435
Why, what's the matter with it?

02:35.455 --> 02:36.696
Looks as though it's been shot.

02:37.297 --> 02:37.877
What happened?

02:38.258 --> 02:38.558
I...

02:38.993 --> 02:40.815
I shot it.

02:40.835 --> 02:41.256
Shot it?

02:42.217 --> 02:43.859
What did you shoot it for?

02:43.879 --> 02:49.086
It was eating up the corn belonging to my master, the cCunt of Saligny, but it's a linea and it would not leave.

02:49.126 --> 02:55.634
Well, of all the stupid things to do, I'll teach you not to shoot my pigs.

02:55.934 --> 02:56.895
How do you like this?

02:57.436 --> 02:57.897
And this?

02:58.337 --> 02:59.178
And this?

02:59.198 --> 02:59.659
And this?

03:00.400 --> 03:00.580
And this?

03:00.580 --> 03:12.659
[Music.]

03:12.659 --> 03:14.121
Good evening, Monsieur Bullock.

03:14.962 --> 03:19.788
Well, Count Saligny, have you come over to pay me for the pig which your servant shot?

03:19.808 --> 03:23.573
No, no, I have come over to spend a quiet evening at your inn.

03:23.994 --> 03:27.999
Well, you owe me the price of my pig, and I want my payment for it.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.103
Is it not enough that you have thrashed my servant, Philippe?

03:31.644 --> 03:33.847
He was protecting my property from your pig.

03:34.467 --> 03:36.490
He didn't have any right to shoot my pig.

03:36.757 --> 03:38.640
Just because it ate a little of your corn?

03:39.180 --> 03:41.283
Why don't you feed your own pigs enough?

03:41.784 --> 03:44.588
Then they wouldn't have to come to my stable and eat up my corn.

03:45.289 --> 03:47.652
I should sue you for damages to my servant.

03:47.672 --> 03:50.395
Well, I won't pay you for any damages to your servant.

03:50.756 --> 03:55.122
He got what he deserved for shooting my pig, but I will collect for my pig.

03:55.142 --> 03:56.624
You still have your servant.

03:56.644 --> 03:58.827
And you can still have your pig.

03:58.847 --> 04:01.270
You can serve him as ham at your hotel.

04:01.911 --> 04:03.473
You haven't lost anything by it.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.644
That was too valuable a pig to serve at the hotel.

04:06.664 --> 04:11.931
Pigs always seem to be the most valuable to their owners after they have been accidentally killed.

04:12.171 --> 04:13.693
That wasn't any accident.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.856
Your servant meant to do that.

04:15.876 --> 04:20.102
And I have instructed him to shoot any other pigs who come in and eat up my corn.

04:20.823 --> 04:27.371
Well, Count, if that's the way you feel about it you can stay out of the Bullock Inn from now on.

04:27.391 --> 04:29.134
You are operating a public place.

04:29.494 --> 04:30.996
It is open to everyone.

04:32.545 --> 04:34.788
It is open to everyone but you.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.129
Now you get out.

04:36.430 --> 04:38.272
This is an insult to me and to France.

04:38.832 --> 04:43.118
And after all that my government is planning on doing for the Republic of Texas.

04:43.138 --> 04:46.702
I shall see the Secretary of State and demand an official apology.

04:46.702 --> 04:55.332
[Music.]

04:55.332 --> 04:59.417
Mr. Secretary, the French charge affair is waiting to see you.

04:59.437 --> 05:00.358
Oh, but I haven't come in.

05:03.207 --> 05:04.709
Good morning, Count of Saligny.

05:05.110 --> 05:07.073
Good morning to you, Monsieur Secretary.

05:07.614 --> 05:08.195
I have a chair.

05:09.197 --> 05:09.577
Thank you.

05:10.198 --> 05:14.104
I've been wanting to see you again about the loan which we wish to receive from your government.

05:14.625 --> 05:18.992
I have been drawing up my recommendations to send to my government.

05:19.012 --> 05:24.441
As you of course know, the Republic of Texas is in rather a difficult situation just now.

05:24.461 --> 05:28.928
The Texas Exchequer bills are being discounted in New Orleans to about half of their value.

05:29.330 --> 05:35.758
Now, if we can get the $7 million from France, which we've requested, it'll bring our credit up into rather good shape.

05:36.458 --> 05:43.307
As soon as we've settled with the Mexican government, so we won't have to support a large army, we'll be able to start meeting our obligations.

05:43.967 --> 05:48.112
And I think you'll find that our trade with France will be extremely valuable.

05:48.352 --> 05:50.315
That may well be, Mr. Secretary.

05:50.956 --> 05:56.362
I will consider all these things which you have told me when I forward my recommendations to France.

05:56.382 --> 05:58.965
Now, there is something else which I wish to discuss with you.

05:59.013 --> 06:00.235
What can I do for you?

06:00.515 --> 06:02.297
I have been grossly insulted.

06:02.317 --> 06:06.303
Monsieur Bullock, who is proprietor of the Bullock Inn, has forbidden me to enter his hotel.

06:07.124 --> 06:08.826
In fact, he threw me out of it last night.

06:09.347 --> 06:10.368
Why has he done that?

06:10.688 --> 06:12.611
A ridiculous affair over a pig.

06:13.072 --> 06:13.472
A pig?

06:13.913 --> 06:17.838
Yes, one of his pigs came into my stable and was eating up my corn.

06:17.858 --> 06:22.104
My servant tried to make the pig leave, and when it would not, he shot the pig.

06:22.124 --> 06:24.767
Monsieur Bullock found out about it and struck my servant.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.019
And he demanded payment for the pig.

06:27.039 --> 06:28.943
Well, did you pay him?

06:28.963 --> 06:29.243
No.

06:29.424 --> 06:30.666
Why should I?

06:30.686 --> 06:33.352
His pig was trespassing on my property.

06:33.372 --> 06:37.821
If we should allow such things to happen, the French delegation would be overrun with pigs.

06:37.841 --> 06:39.164
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

06:39.404 --> 06:43.853
I want an official apology from your government for this insult to me and to my country.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.994
And I want permission to patronize the Bullock Inn.

06:47.375 --> 06:50.860
Well, I don't see why you should want to go back to the inn after this has occurred.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.584
It happens that I like to spend my evenings there.

06:54.005 --> 06:54.786
Nom de nom.

06:55.186 --> 07:01.015
That monsieur Bullock, for all his outrageous conduct, serves an excellent glass of poignet.

07:01.383 --> 07:06.111
Well, I don't see how I can justify making an official apology for such a small thing.

07:06.131 --> 07:07.192
A small thing?

07:07.934 --> 07:11.960
Is the friendliness of the Republic of France for the Republic of Texas a small thing?

07:12.641 --> 07:19.392
You have been asking France for a loan of seven million dollars, but you cannot please her representative by granting this small request?

07:19.672 --> 07:22.497
I don't believe I should get officially mixed up in it.

07:22.517 --> 07:22.998
Very well.

07:23.739 --> 07:25.602
Well, I have been insulted in this country.

07:25.919 --> 07:27.221
I've been refused an apology.

07:27.701 --> 07:28.663
Therefore, I shall leave.

07:29.163 --> 07:31.546
Monsieur Secretary, I, I bid you adieu.

07:31.546 --> 07:40.898
[Music.]

07:40.898 --> 07:41.279
Philippe.

07:42.140 --> 07:43.001
Oui, Monsieur de Saligny.

07:43.382 --> 07:45.464
You will pack up all our possessions.

07:45.484 --> 07:48.328
Tomorrow we leave for a New Orleans in the United States.

07:48.348 --> 07:49.169
We're leaving, Monsieur?

07:49.610 --> 07:52.373
I've been refused an apology by the Republic of Texas.

07:52.393 --> 07:53.715
I can no longer remain here.

07:54.185 --> 07:56.067
But what shall we do with this house?

07:56.087 --> 07:57.428
Will you shut up the legation?

07:57.448 --> 07:58.709
Yes, we will lock the door.

07:59.550 --> 08:01.052
I will be sorry to leave this house.

08:01.612 --> 08:03.654
It's so much like the houses of France.

08:04.355 --> 08:05.316
It cannot be helped.

08:05.716 --> 08:10.480
If I cannot be accorded the treatment which my position demands, I am better off not to stay.

08:11.201 --> 08:12.502
You will like New Orleans, I believe.

08:12.923 --> 08:17.627
There are many pretty French girls there, and there will be no attacks upon the town by the Mexicans.

08:18.028 --> 08:20.530
If you say so, monsieur, I'm sure it must be.

08:20.530 --> 08:35.663
[Music.]

08:35.663 --> 08:38.546
Well, and how do you like New Orleans by now, Philippe?

08:39.066 --> 08:40.107
It is very nice.

08:40.547 --> 08:42.709
You like the music, the gaiety here?

08:43.270 --> 08:45.632
It is almost like Paris, monsieur.

08:45.652 --> 08:48.334
I believe you have found someone in whom you are interested.

08:48.735 --> 08:51.377
I saw you walking in the street last night with a pretty young thing.

08:51.818 --> 08:53.119
She is more pretty shoe, monsieur.

08:53.699 --> 08:57.443
Well, I am afraid you will have to say goodbye for a while to your little cabbage, Philippe.

08:57.983 --> 08:59.485
I have been recalled to Texas.

08:59.985 --> 09:01.146
When do you plan to go, monsieur?

09:01.366 --> 09:02.127
In a week.

09:02.147 --> 09:04.489
It will take me that long to straighten out my affairs.

09:05.161 --> 09:07.145
You are not happy?

09:07.166 --> 09:08.769
It will be sad to leave, my friend.

09:09.170 --> 09:11.535
Why do you not take her to the priest?

09:11.555 --> 09:17.649
After a suitable ceremony, I believe I could arrange transportation for you both back to Austin with me.

09:17.669 --> 09:18.992
Ah, you're very kind, mister.

09:18.992 --> 09:29.663
[Music.]

09:29.663 --> 09:31.967
Philippe, does your new wife like Austin?

09:32.207 --> 09:33.569
Ah, very well, monsieur.

09:33.589 --> 09:35.051
We're very happy here.

09:35.071 --> 09:37.936
You have put the legation back into excellent condition.

09:38.317 --> 09:39.458
The house is spotless.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.341
You are to be complimented.

09:41.361 --> 09:42.103
Merci, monsieur.

09:42.764 --> 09:44.426
I have a message to deliver to you.

09:44.446 --> 09:45.127
Yes, yes.

09:45.147 --> 09:45.548
From whom?

09:45.828 --> 09:47.050
From innkeeper Bullock.

09:47.271 --> 09:49.093
What does that scoundrel want from me now?

09:49.454 --> 09:52.439
He desires to have you as a guest for dinner this evening.

09:52.839 --> 09:54.121
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

09:54.141 --> 09:54.842
Come on.

09:54.863 --> 09:57.747
He says to tell you that as a friendly gesture,

09:57.727 --> 10:00.670
He'll be pleased to serve you an excellent slice of ham.

10:01.370 --> 10:05.694
Not from the same... No, monsieur, not from the same pig.

10:05.714 --> 10:08.116
Did he mention our recent difficulty?

10:08.276 --> 10:08.716
Oui, monsieur.

10:09.137 --> 10:13.240
He says that he is willing to overlook the entire affair if you are.

10:13.260 --> 10:13.981
And how about you?

10:14.601 --> 10:15.702
Remember that he struck you.

10:16.343 --> 10:19.886
He's also serving my wife and me in the kitchen at the inn.

10:19.986 --> 10:23.329
It appears that this is in the nature of being an apology.

10:23.349 --> 10:25.831
I can at least be as generous as he is.

10:25.851 --> 10:26.251
Very good.

10:26.652 --> 10:27.092
I accept.

10:27.697 --> 10:32.323
Will you tell Monsieur Bullock that I will arrive at the Bullock Inn promptly at 8 o'clock?

10:32.343 --> 10:33.084
I will tell him, Monsieur.

10:33.544 --> 10:34.646
And Philippe?

10:35.126 --> 10:35.507
Oui, Monsieur.

10:36.047 --> 10:40.153
Will you take a box of the new Cuban cigars to Monsieur Bullock?

10:40.173 --> 10:40.633
Oui, Monsieur.

10:42.756 --> 10:46.120
Of course, there are some things which I have not forgotten.

10:46.140 --> 10:49.504
I have not yet received an official apology from the Secretary of State.

10:50.525 --> 10:54.210
I am afraid that my recommendations to my government were quite clear.

10:54.865 --> 10:57.968
I doubt if France will ever loan the money to Texas now.

10:57.988 --> 10:59.509
It is unfortunate, monsieur.

11:00.130 --> 11:18.085
Yes, a $7 million loan is quite a price to pay for the attack of one small pig on the property of the French legation.

11:18.105 --> 11:23.590
That is all that history and legend tell us about that ridiculous affair known as the pig episodes.

11:24.329 --> 11:32.680
As a result of this incident, the financially embarrassed Republic of Texas did not receive the $7 million loan from France.

11:34.442 --> 11:42.973
The historic French legation still stands in East Austin on Robertson Hill, near the corner of San Marcos and East 6th Street.

11:42.993 --> 11:46.218
The house, now privately owned, is the oldest in Austin.

11:46.938 --> 11:54.268
It is in the provincial French cottage style of architecture, with double doors and with locks and hinges bought from France.

11:54.788 --> 11:58.893
The doors are of barrel design and swing on serpentine hinges.

11:58.913 --> 12:00.815
Construction was begun in 1841.

12:00.895 --> 12:09.126
The French legation was then the only building to be built by a foreign government on Texas soil.

12:09.126 --> 12:17.556
[Music.]

12:17.556 --> 12:22.602
This building, now more than a hundred years old, is defying time and the weather.

12:23.071 --> 12:28.118
Made from hand-sawn oak and stoutly constructed, it is even yet in good repair.

12:28.719 --> 12:33.045
Through the years, the forests of Texas have furnished material for the houses.

12:33.686 --> 12:37.011
Texas today has nearly two million houses.

12:37.412 --> 12:43.660
Three-quarters of these, or nearly one and a half million houses, are built from lumber grown in Texas.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.364
The other half million houses also have wood in them.

12:46.805 --> 12:49.669
Wooden floors, doors, window sash, and trims.

12:50.138 --> 13:00.013
2,000 retail lumber dealers in Texas distribute Texas lumber to the far corners of the state, handling millions of dollars' worth of wood from Texas forests.

13:00.033 --> 13:01.676
According to Director W.E.

13:01.756 --> 13:10.449
White at the Texas Forest Service, thousands upon thousands of new homes are being built this year from Texas timber to help relieve the housing shortage.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.093
But even this is not enough.

13:13.113 --> 13:18.762
More and more Texas timber must be grown if the people of the state are to have houses in which to live.

13:19.417 --> 13:21.280
We need homes.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.502
Homes need lumber.

13:23.123 --> 13:33.900
Texas must protect its lumber from fire and use it wisely.

13:34.881 --> 13:45.137
A constant supply of timber can build a greater Texas.
