00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
[Silence.]

00:08.000 --> 00:24.483
[Music.]

00:24.483 --> 00:46.153
Howdy friends! yes sir this is your range rider Jelly Elliott and the three Knotheads sitting right here under the old pine tree down by the trail and 
we'd like to have you come down visit with us for the next 14 and a half minutes. We're going to be around play a few tunes here we've got a lot of things 
we want to talk to you about so just stick around make yourself at home.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.308
Well, thank you, boys.

00:56.348 --> 00:57.729
Thank you, yes, sir.

00:57.749 --> 01:01.773
And, uh, by George, a pleasant day to all of you out there, friends.

01:01.793 --> 01:06.097
We're just receiving a lot of fan mail, just getting a lot of cards and letters.

01:07.218 --> 01:10.661
And, boy, we've really got a good offer here for you.

01:10.681 --> 01:12.623
I'm going to tell you all about it in just a few minutes.

01:12.683 --> 01:19.689
It's something extra special, and I wish that it was so that I could personally put one of these books in every home.

01:19.729 --> 01:22.071
I'm going to tell you all about it in a few minutes.

01:22.091 --> 01:23.953
We're going to do several...

01:23.933 --> 01:38.550
Good old hymns today and I want all you old timers just to gather around there and just make yourself comfortable and 
stay with us because we're going to tell you just how the forest and the flame comes in with the Bible.

01:38.817 --> 01:42.240
And we're going to let you know more about that in just a minute.

01:42.280 --> 01:46.405
First, we're going to get things started off here with, I believe, one of Red Foley's tunes.

01:46.425 --> 01:48.727
And Red does a mighty good job on this tune.

01:48.747 --> 01:50.329
And we're going to try to do it.

01:50.349 --> 01:51.630
We've had a lot of requests for it.

01:51.650 --> 01:52.451
So here it is.

01:52.871 --> 01:53.932
And I'll try to sing it.

01:53.952 --> 01:58.657
Lay Down Your Soul.

02:00.499 --> 02:04.243
As you travel the highway, some cool brother go slow.

02:04.683 --> 02:07.626
There's a dangerous curve ahead.

02:08.028 --> 02:19.506
Take the straight and the narrow road, don't turn from the way, at his feet give up your sins, lay down your soul, lay down your soul before your maker. 
Lay down your wordly... Let Jesus know you need his mercy. At his feet give up your sins, lay down your soul.

02:33.965 --> 02:35.848
Journey to Beulah land.

02:35.868 --> 02:37.570
Don't fall by the way.

02:37.971 --> 02:42.256
Every sin's on every hand.

02:42.276 --> 02:43.859
Be led by temptation.

02:44.399 --> 02:46.142
Hear the angels sing.

02:46.162 --> 02:47.904
Let his feet give up your sin.

02:48.105 --> 02:49.807
Lay down your soul.

02:49.827 --> 02:53.652
Lay down your soul before your maker.

02:53.993 --> 02:54.994
Lay down your wordly... Let Jesus know you need his mercy.

03:02.298 --> 03:29.605
At his feet give up your sins, lay down your soul. Take your burdens and worries lay them all at his feet. He will lead the pain to bear. put your trust 
in the savior and his glory you'll see. at his feet give up your sins. Lay down your soul. Lay down your soul before your maker. lay down your worldly...

03:33.803 --> 04:02.865
Let Jesus know you need his mercy. At his feet give up your sins. Lay down your soul. Well thank you boys. thank you. Robert was helping me there on the course of that tune friends 
and we sincerely hope that you enjoyed it just a whole lot there. Now friends i want to tell you about a fella that i know most of you already know 
this if you just stop to think. Tell you about the fella that used to set the woods on fire. Every year he'd

04:03.132 --> 04:04.073
Burn up the woods.

04:04.694 --> 04:06.697
And somehow or another, he just quit.

04:07.418 --> 04:07.919
He quit.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.681
He just quit all that foolishness.

04:10.302 --> 04:21.478
Now, he didn't quit because somebody told him that he was doing the wrong thing, that he was doing a lot of harm, or he didn't quit because his wife used to fuss at him about it, and all that sort of stuff.

04:21.539 --> 04:22.740
That ain't the reason he quit.

04:23.982 --> 04:31.553
But he quit because he had, that man was a God-fearing man, and he finally got the word of God right, and

04:32.157 --> 04:40.107
He got it from his preacher, and he thought enough about the sins of woods burning to preach a whole sermon about it.

04:40.168 --> 04:49.560
This preacher did out there in that little old country church on a Sunday morning, and everything peaceful and quiet out there in the country.

04:49.580 --> 04:55.027
And this preacher preached a whole sermon on woods burning and how it comes into the Bible there.

04:55.508 --> 05:01.135
He tells all about the trees and the woods and what happens to them when you burn them up and abuse them and waste them.

05:01.790 --> 05:05.654
And the Bible uses fire as a sign of wickedness.

05:05.874 --> 05:06.816
We all know that.

05:07.737 --> 05:11.120
And that's why that man quit burning the woods.

05:11.140 --> 05:17.267
Isaiah said, For wickedness burneth as the fire, it devoureth as the briar and the thorns.

05:17.287 --> 05:23.234
Yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

05:23.254 --> 05:29.020
Through the wrath of the Lord the host is the Lamb darting, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire.

05:29.060 --> 05:30.902
No man shall spare his brother.

05:31.439 --> 05:33.061
Now that's it.

05:33.081 --> 05:33.622
And in St.

05:33.662 --> 05:39.168
John, in the Revelation, it says, Hurt not the earth nor the trees.

05:40.410 --> 05:44.755
And in Exodus, it's written just as plain as the nose on your face.

05:44.775 --> 05:57.730
If a fire break out, catch us in the thorns, so that the stacks of corn of the standing corn, or the fields, be consumed therewith, he that kindleth the fire shall surely make restitution.

05:58.511 --> 06:01.294
Now that's it, friends, just in plain

06:01.595 --> 06:21.156
english and writing and you can see it for yourself and it all ties in and it all adds up and all of you know that we don't have any of the big timber anymore the big old timber it's all gone you know the great big old virgin pines and all that they all gone they've just been

06:21.507 --> 06:24.450
cut down and nobody's planted them back and they're gone.

06:24.531 --> 06:27.374
It all adds up and it's right in the Bible there.

06:27.394 --> 06:28.655
It's fulfilling.

06:28.675 --> 06:29.857
We've got to do something about it.

06:30.197 --> 06:31.399
Here's another song, friends.

06:31.419 --> 06:34.262
I believe Robert and Slim's going to sing this one.

06:34.282 --> 06:38.147
Another beautiful old hymn that we've picked out for you today.

06:38.167 --> 06:39.168
We hope you enjoy it.

06:39.188 --> 06:42.672
They're going to do a duet on this tune.

06:43.040 --> 06:48.391
And I want to dedicate it to all the mothers out there listening.

06:48.411 --> 06:49.934
And my mother likes this tune.

06:50.115 --> 06:50.736
God bless her.

06:50.836 --> 06:54.524
I hope she's listening and enjoys it too.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.690
And they're going to sing What a Friend We Have in Jesus.

06:59.554 --> 07:04.204
What a friend we have in Jesus.

07:05.787 --> 07:30.259
All our sins and griefs to bear What a privilege to carry Everything to God in prayer

07:37.141 --> 07:56.601
we often forbear oh what needless pains we bear all because we do not care

08:01.036 --> 08:09.250
Everything to God in prayer.

08:10.732 --> 08:11.734
Well, thank you, boys.

08:11.794 --> 08:12.195
Thank you.

08:12.235 --> 08:16.362
I hope that you all enjoyed that fine old hymn there.

08:16.662 --> 08:24.152
And it's just, tell you, it brings back old days when we used to have the old day singing and the dinner on the ground.

08:24.853 --> 08:28.558
You know, really, everybody just had a swell time then.

08:28.638 --> 08:31.683
You know, friends, I told you we had something for you here free.

08:31.743 --> 08:32.404
It's all free.

08:32.424 --> 08:33.345
We want you to have it.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.069
We really want you to have it.

08:36.089 --> 08:43.038
Your State Forest Service boys there and Uncle Sam's Forest Service has made it possible for you to have this little book.

08:43.859 --> 08:46.483
And it tells all about FARC.

08:46.700 --> 08:50.385
Now this new book does.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.668
And how it's written in the Bible there.

08:52.688 --> 08:57.975
It mixes the trees and the forest fires and wood fires and all that right into the Bible.

08:59.417 --> 09:03.823
And just how you're supposed to take care of these trees and keep them free from fires.

09:03.843 --> 09:07.328
And your own state forestry service there will send you one of these little books.

09:07.388 --> 09:11.273
Now this is a real fine book with a lot of pictures and

09:11.590 --> 09:16.074
Boys, you'll really value this book a whole lot, and we want you to have it.

09:16.094 --> 09:18.176

A nice book, and we want you to have it.

09:43.884 --> 09:47.728

State Forestry boys, they want you to have it.

09:53.274 --> 09:55.257
So just write me a penny postcard or letter.

That's all you got to do.

Address your penny postcard or letter to Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads in care of the station which you're now listening, and we'll send you this little book.

10:04.107 --> 10:06.409
We're going to feature Deacon on this next tune.

10:06.449 --> 10:08.311
It's a mighty pretty tune.

10:08.331 --> 10:10.774
Deacon does a good job on Hawaiian numbers,

10:11.108 --> 10:16.255
And he's going to do this next tune for all the friends out there that likes Hawaiian music.

10:16.275 --> 10:19.110
He's picked out a pretty tune, How Are You Now?

10:19.110 --> 11:37.812
[Music.]

11:37.812 --> 11:38.573
Thank you, Deacon.

11:38.593 --> 11:38.913
Thank you.

11:38.933 --> 11:39.414
There it is.

11:39.434 --> 11:40.115
How are you now?

11:40.175 --> 11:41.116
Ain't that a pretty tune?

11:42.097 --> 11:43.599
Deacon does a good job on it, too.

11:44.620 --> 11:51.187
Friends, you just notice when you go to church there on Sunday, you just notice how often the preacher there, he'll mention about fire.

11:53.210 --> 11:55.092
That's something to be dreaded.

11:55.172 --> 11:58.676
I'll tell you, everybody dreads fire.

11:58.756 --> 12:05.203
You can find a man, I don't care how brave he is, he might stand up and fight a den of wildcats or a circle saw.

12:05.223 --> 12:07.566
But when the fire turns up there, well, he

12:07.799 --> 12:08.640
He'll shun that.

12:09.281 --> 12:13.966
That's one thing that'll make the bravest man in the world run this far.

12:13.986 --> 12:18.051
And you'll find it all along in the Bible, just like we just got through telling you there.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.815
And we want you to have this little book that I was telling you about.

12:20.855 --> 12:22.697
It's all free, and we want you to read it.

12:23.478 --> 12:34.071
And when you get through reading it and all, maybe there's some friend of yours that possibly didn't get one or maybe missed out on this broadcast and didn't know about it and all, you can pass it on to him.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.933
I know you'll want him to read it.

12:36.638 --> 12:40.263
All you do to get this book, friends, don't forget is just write to me.

12:40.824 --> 12:45.309
Write to Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads in care of the station that you're now listening to.

12:45.329 --> 12:50.997
And we'll just be glad to send you this little book.

12:51.017 --> 12:52.499
It just don't cost you a thing.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.184
So keep that in mind.

12:56.204 --> 12:57.085
And sit down right now.

12:57.105 --> 12:57.806
Don't put it off.

12:58.286 --> 13:02.071
Sit down right now and write us a penny postcard or letter and let us send you this little book.

13:02.492 --> 13:03.253
We want you to have it.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.116
Well, we're about to run out of time here.

13:07.136 --> 13:08.437
We're just about to run out of time.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.919
We're going to have to shove on down the trail.

13:10.999 --> 13:14.643
We've enjoyed sitting around here under the old pine tree, though, playing for you, friends.

13:14.663 --> 13:18.367
And we come to you just ever so often here on this same station.

13:18.947 --> 13:24.252
And if you listen to the announcer, when we go off there, he'll let you know just what day we'll be back.

13:24.272 --> 13:28.557
And we'd sure like to have you come down the trail there with us and set a spell.

13:29.197 --> 13:33.021
And we'll play the request that you like to hear for a try.

13:33.592 --> 13:36.676
And don't forget to get them cards and letters in the mail today.

13:36.756 --> 13:37.657
We want to hear from you.

13:37.697 --> 13:41.382
Just send them to Jelly Elliott and the Three Knot Heads and carry the station in which you're now listening.

13:41.723 --> 13:45.187
We're going to have to go, friends, but before we go, I'd like to leave this thought for the day.

13:46.569 --> 13:50.053
Like that poet fellow says, only God can make a tree.

13:50.714 --> 13:58.384
Well, it looks like we ought to be able to carry out our end of the load and keep fire from burning it up.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.242
Friends, we've really enjoyed visiting with you.

14:01.763 --> 14:04.507
Hope that you've enjoyed it just half as much as we have.

14:05.869 --> 14:09.895
And don't forget, this is Jelly Elliott, the old woods rider, and we'll be back with you.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.319
Just listen to the announcer, and he'll let you know.

14:12.339 --> 14:17.058
Friends, in the meantime, remember, only you can prevent woods fires.

14:17.078 --> 14:44.303
[Music.]
