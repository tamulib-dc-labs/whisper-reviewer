00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
[Silence.]

00:14.000 --> 00:33.750
[Music.]

00:33.750 --> 00:25.244
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:25.664 --> 00:27.266
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:27.306 --> 00:28.948
That was how he got his name.

00:29.649 --> 00:30.390
Hi there, friends.

00:30.470 --> 00:32.372
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:32.993 --> 00:34.795
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:35.396 --> 00:39.240
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:40.322 --> 00:42.424
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:43.349 --> 00:46.792
That's because we kept fires from running wild through here.

00:46.812 --> 00:51.256
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:52.097 --> 00:57.662
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the Sons of the Pioneers.

00:58.163 --> 01:03.668
They've been waiting for you to get settled so they can do this song especially for you.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.930
Buffalo, buffalo.

01:07.331 --> 01:10.234
Buffalo, buffalo.

01:10.433 --> 01:16.541
They're gone from the plains of Montana.

01:16.561 --> 01:18.323
Buffalo, buffalo.

01:19.244 --> 01:24.391
There's none left in old Idaho.

01:24.411 --> 01:26.574
Buffalo, buffalo.

01:27.495 --> 01:31.460
No longer there's thunder.

01:31.640 --> 01:36.827
Just bleached bones lie under the snow.

01:36.887 --> 01:39.090
Buffalo, buffalo.

01:39.712 --> 01:43.097
Buffalo, buffalo.

01:44.019 --> 01:50.028
The great shaggy herds fed the Indians.

01:50.048 --> 01:52.292
Buffalo, buffalo.

01:52.312 --> 01:57.520
From the Sioux down to old Mexico.

01:57.580 --> 01:59.683
Buffalo, buffalo.

02:00.645 --> 02:04.150
Now Fermi went sighing.

02:05.345 --> 02:16.419
Tell of the diet they... buffalo, buffalo. Buffalo, buffalo.

02:17.841 --> 02:24.609
Many a humpback bull felt the arrow sting.

02:26.131 --> 02:33.040
Winchesters blazed away to down the prairie king.

02:36.631 --> 03:05.659
Where is the thrill of the rumbling? Buffalo, buffalo. Of ten million holes pounding on. Buffalo, buffalo. A few lines of history Will tell of the mystery. They're gone. Buffalo, buffalo. Buffalo, buffalo.

03:05.977 --> 03:09.520
Buffalo.

03:10.141 --> 03:10.702
Buffalo.

03:12.163 --> 03:16.027
Buffalo.

03:16.047 --> 03:16.647
Buffalo.

03:17.688 --> 03:23.414
Buffalo. Golly, there's a lot of tradition back of the buffalo, that grand old animal of the plains.

03:24.695 --> 03:28.379
And thanks to folks who look ahead, the buffalo is still around.

03:30.141 --> 03:33.664
There are a lot of things in the American scene that are worth preserving, aren't there?

03:34.925 --> 03:35.646
On the other hand,

03:35.980 --> 03:38.564
There's one particular thing I'm thinking about.

03:38.584 --> 03:42.950
If we could just do away with it, it would be wonderful.

03:42.970 --> 03:47.497
I'm talking about setting the woods on fire, either carelessly or intentionally.

03:48.278 --> 03:50.621
Yes, I said intentionally.

03:50.641 --> 03:56.530
The sad fact is that a lot of the forest fires we still have in this country are deliberately set.

03:57.812 --> 04:01.617
Deliberately set by folks who probably don't realize the damage they're doing.

04:02.778 --> 04:08.266
For instance, some folks still think they can get rid of the boll weevil and other crop pests by burning the woods.

04:09.328 --> 04:10.710
Well, it just doesn't work that way.

04:11.631 --> 04:18.421
All that happens is that the pests get a little warm because they've dug down into the ground or into wet, rotting stocks.

04:19.823 --> 04:27.073
With other folks, it's more or less a habit or custom that has passed down from one generation to another.

04:27.093 --> 04:30.979
I'm sure that people like that could put their energy to better purpose.

04:31.482 --> 04:32.824
if they just think about it.

04:34.306 --> 04:40.575
Yes, sir, keeping the woods from wildfire is a full-time job, just like raising a good crop of anything.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.599
Remember the boy who found that out?

04:45.141 --> 04:57.979
Come, Georgia boy, come listen to my song concerning the man who made no corn, the reason why I cannot tell, for I am sure that he worked right well.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.822
In September, his corn was knee-high.

05:02.283 --> 05:04.566
In October, he laid it by.

05:04.947 --> 05:08.132
In November, there came a great frost.

05:08.152 --> 05:13.239
And you can't tell how much he lost.

05:13.259 --> 05:18.507
In the winter, I was told, he went a-courtin' very bold.

05:18.788 --> 05:26.059
When his courtship first began. My kind sir, did you make any corn?

05:26.039 --> 05:53.667
No kind miss was his reply. Long ago I laid it by. It wasn't worthwhile to strive in vain For I didn't expect to make one grain. 
My kind sir, you ask me to wed. If that is your way, we'll have no bread. Single I am, and single I'll remain. For a lazy man I won't maintain.

05:53.883 --> 05:56.747
For a lazy man I won't maintain.

06:00.933 --> 06:04.899
You know, most folks believe laziness is a habit.

06:04.919 --> 06:06.882
I suppose it is.

06:06.902 --> 06:10.187
But it's one that can be broken, just like any other bad habit.

06:11.169 --> 06:13.512
And you can't help but admire a man who does it.

06:15.034 --> 06:21.544
I think you'll agree that deliberately setting the woods on fire is about as bad a habit as anyone can get into.

06:22.891 --> 06:29.537
We can only hope that folks who still do that will work as hard as they can to quit it.

06:29.557 --> 06:30.919
What do you think, Loanne?

06:30.939 --> 06:38.166
Yes, Billy, it's hard to believe that in this day and time, anyone would go out and set the woods on fire deliberately.

06:38.186 --> 06:51.058
Now, I can understand how some folks might feel they got a good reason for doing it, but honestly, if they'd only stop and think, if they'd only take a little time to study the whole business carefully,

06:51.528 --> 06:53.871
they had realized themselves that they were doing wrong.

06:54.853 --> 07:00.481
Now, in the old days of the West, there were killers, gunmen who spread fear and heartache across the land.

07:01.282 --> 07:05.789
They actually slowed down progress in the building of our country.

07:05.809 --> 07:10.136
In these times today, folks have learned to get along together.

07:10.156 --> 07:18.548
For the most part, we respect each other and each other's property, whether it's a man's home, his fields, or his woods.

07:19.456 --> 07:27.964
It seems to me that today anyone who sets the woods on fire is still a killer of a sort, whether he means to do it or not.

07:29.065 --> 07:40.056
I really feel very strong about this subject.

07:40.076 --> 07:45.902
Boots and Stetson and six guns and the lilies grow high.

07:47.907 --> 07:58.203
They grow for a man with a gun swinging hand that before his time must die.

07:58.223 --> 08:05.014
They grow in the trail he has traveled, a trail well spattered with lead.

08:06.416 --> 08:10.121
They weep for the graves of the many men.

08:10.562 --> 08:15.670
They weep for the men now dead.

08:16.882 --> 08:25.357
He rides along lonely, no friends, but only the lilies growing high.

08:25.377 --> 08:35.554
All men seem to fear him, not one will go near him, and he knows the reason why.

08:35.574 --> 08:38.940
His name and fame spread before him.

08:39.612 --> 09:02.565
Like a carpet of death he knows. One day he'll be slow on the draw And then for him a lily will grow. A woman may love him Though she knows soon above him The lilies grow with high.

09:02.984 --> 09:11.513
Then like the lily, she'll bow down her head, bow down her forehead and cry.

09:13.214 --> 09:20.582
On some boot hill they will lay him, and a headboard will sway in the wind.

09:21.843 --> 09:30.932
A lily will nod and gently weep for another gunman's head.

09:32.903 --> 09:43.757
Boots and Stetsons and six guns and the lilies grow high.

09:44.518 --> 09:45.259
Thank you, fellas.

09:46.340 --> 09:49.664
You know, friends, we get so much from our woods and forests.

09:50.466 --> 09:55.993
Lumber and pulpwood, rosin, turpentine, and other forest products.

09:57.034 --> 10:01.780
They give us outdoor fun and hunting and fishing, picnicking and camping.

10:03.008 --> 10:08.293
And, of course, they hold the land that gives us steady supplies of good, clean water.

10:09.715 --> 10:15.601
We just can't afford to have these values damaged or destroyed, deliberately or any other way.

10:16.822 --> 10:22.288
The law, I'm glad to say, is getting stronger and stronger on this point as time goes on.

10:22.308 --> 10:31.497
And since forest fire prevention is getting stronger backing from the law, it seems to me that some folks ought to get with it or smarten up, as the saying goes.

10:32.438 --> 10:33.640
How about that, Hugh Farr?

10:34.321 --> 10:42.632
It seems to me, and I've been around quite a bit, that most folks want to get on the right road of living and stay on it.

10:42.652 --> 10:55.729
I'm willing to bet that when the guy who burns the woods for one reason or another finally realizes it's a sin to let fire run wild, he'll end up by getting on the right road, too.

10:56.317 --> 10:59.286
My Lord, it's so high.

10:59.406 --> 11:00.249
Can't get over it.

11:00.289 --> 11:01.392
So wide.

11:01.413 --> 11:02.275
Can't get around it.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.399
So low.

11:03.419 --> 11:04.201
Can't get under it.

11:04.221 --> 11:05.726
You must come in at the door.

11:05.746 --> 11:07.170
My Lord, it's too high.

11:08.467 --> 11:09.328
Can't get over it. Too wide, too.

11:09.348 --> 11:10.149
Can't get around it.

11:10.290 --> 11:11.251
Way too low.

11:11.351 --> 11:12.132
Can't get under it.

11:12.152 --> 11:13.975
You must come in at the door.

11:13.995 --> 11:15.236
Good morning, brother.

11:15.256 --> 11:16.118
I'll do.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.480
Tell me where you bound.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.080
Do tell.

11:18.221 --> 11:21.505
Tell me if you're heading for some far enchanted ground.

11:21.645 --> 11:23.348
My Lord, it's so high.

11:23.368 --> 11:24.229
Can't get over it.

11:24.249 --> 11:25.290
So wide.

11:25.391 --> 11:26.232
Can't get around it.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.133
So low.

11:27.113 --> 11:28.114
Can't get under it.

11:28.134 --> 11:29.877
You must come in at the door.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.419
The Baptists go by water.

11:31.439 --> 11:32.080
Ship ahoy.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.382
The Methodists go over land.

11:33.402 --> 11:34.003
Can't sail.

11:34.223 --> 11:37.628
I'll get there by the grace of God and we'll all go hand in hand.

11:37.648 --> 11:39.230
My Lord, it's so high.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.091
Can't get over it.

11:40.131 --> 11:41.193
So wide.

11:41.213 --> 11:42.054
Can't get around it.

11:42.094 --> 11:43.076
So low.

11:43.196 --> 11:43.977
Can't get under it.

11:43.997 --> 11:45.679
You must come in at the door.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.242
The heavenly cruise at work.

11:47.262 --> 11:47.842
Hard work.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.244
Morning, noon, and night.

11:49.264 --> 11:49.845
No rest.

11:49.865 --> 11:52.709
If you find a sinner on the wrong road, brother, put him on the road.

11:52.729 --> 11:53.250
That's right.

11:53.370 --> 11:53.931
My Lord, it's

11:53.911 --> 11:54.813
Too high.

11:54.973 --> 11:55.955
Can't get over it.

11:55.975 --> 11:56.936
Too wide.

11:56.976 --> 11:57.938
Can't get around it.

11:57.958 --> 11:58.840
Too low.

11:58.980 --> 11:59.841
Can't get under it.

11:59.901 --> 12:01.604
You must come in at the door.

12:01.705 --> 12:03.147
I've told you once, poor sinner.

12:03.167 --> 12:03.768
Yes, sir.

12:03.788 --> 12:05.130
And I'll tell you twice.

12:05.150 --> 12:05.651
Two times.

12:05.671 --> 12:09.037
You'll never get to heaven through the open door, playing cards and shooting dice.

12:09.117 --> 12:10.740
My Lord, it's so high.

12:10.860 --> 12:11.782
Can't get over it.

12:11.842 --> 12:12.904
So wide.

12:12.924 --> 12:13.806
Can't get around it.

12:13.826 --> 12:14.687
So low.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.189
Can't get under it, you must come in at the door.

12:17.209 --> 12:18.631
My Lord, it's too high.

12:18.851 --> 12:19.672
Can't get over it.

12:19.752 --> 12:20.593
Too wide, too.

12:20.833 --> 12:21.614
Can't get around it.

12:21.654 --> 12:22.755
And way too low.

12:22.855 --> 12:29.261
Can't get under it, you must come in at the door.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.303
Well, look who's coming up the trail now.

12:31.323 --> 12:35.647
Big as life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all tugged out in dungarees.

12:36.468 --> 12:38.610
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

12:39.050 --> 12:44.455
He's the popular candidate, the people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:45.160 --> 12:48.585
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:48.605 --> 12:50.507
Hello there, friends.

12:50.888 --> 12:53.191
Today I just want to say thanks.

12:53.211 --> 12:59.700
Thanks to all of the good people who are supporting me in this campaign against forests and wood spires.

13:00.041 --> 13:04.587
Especially the JPs, the justices of the peace, and the court judges.

13:04.921 --> 13:11.430
They're the men who have to enforce the laws against careless, thoughtless, or illegal use of fire.

13:11.450 --> 13:18.219
I know that they're as anxious as I am that people be careful and sensible in using fire outdoors.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.764
Well, I'll be seeing you.

13:21.784 --> 13:24.087
And there he goes down the trail.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.470
Thank you, Smokey.

13:26.490 --> 13:29.494
Well, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:30.395 --> 13:33.139
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine trees.

13:33.980 --> 13:43.053
You know, friends, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:43.974 --> 13:55.290
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:56.031 --> 14:02.721
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest, woods, and range fires.

14:03.376 --> 14:11.917
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:12.418 --> 14:16.348
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:16.729 --> 14:21.300
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:21.280 --> 14:25.507
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

14:26.088 --> 14:30.074
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin the air.

14:30.695 --> 14:34.741
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

14:35.122 --> 14:39.449
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:39.449 --> 14:58.144
