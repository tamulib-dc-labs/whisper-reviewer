00:18.425 --> 00:25.274
The Texas Forest Service of A&M College presents an incident in the history of the Texas Navy.

00:29.941 --> 00:38.412
The year was 1843 and the Republic of Texas had been going through a long period of war with the Mexican Centralist government.

00:38.432 --> 00:46.103
Santa Ana's forces had repeatedly attacked Texas and the attempt to blockade the ports of Texas to stop the flow of supplies.

00:46.336 --> 00:48.999
So the Texas Navy had been organized.

00:49.019 --> 00:50.661
It had two purposes.

00:50.681 --> 01:03.194
First, to keep the sea lanes open for supply ships to Texas, and secondly, to cause so much disturbance to Mexico that it would not have the opportunity to send soldiers and supplies to attack Texas.

01:03.214 --> 01:07.318
Texas had an ally in its fight against the Mexican centralist government.

01:07.338 --> 01:13.204
The state of Yucatan in the south was also trying to gain its permanent independence from the Mexican government.

01:13.792 --> 01:19.659
It was to the advantage of Texas to help the Yucatan government, thus dividing the power of the Mexican army.

01:20.319 --> 01:27.928
Yucatan had even paid a rental fee to Texas for the use of the Texas Navy in carrying the war to Mexican ports.

01:27.948 --> 01:36.297
But in the year 1843, the Texas Navy had been laid up in the ports of Galveston and New Orleans for two years.

01:36.958 --> 01:42.364
The Texas government had not appropriated enough money to repair the ships and pay the wages of the sailors.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.178
Commodore E.W.

01:44.238 --> 01:55.355
Moore of the Texas Navy was in his hotel room in New Orleans on the morning of February 24, 1843, when he received two callers.

01:55.375 --> 01:57.999
You are Commodore Moore of the Texas Navy?

01:58.019 --> 02:00.843
Commodore Moore or Captain Moore, whichever you please.

02:01.545 --> 02:04.709
I am Colonel James Morgan, and this is Mr. William Bryan.

02:04.770 --> 02:06.312
Glad to know you, gentlemen.

02:06.332 --> 02:07.213
What can I do for you?

02:07.594 --> 02:08.976
We've just arrived from Houston.

02:09.260 --> 02:12.805
We've been named as naval commissioners by the 7th Texas Congress.

02:13.386 --> 02:17.673
We've been given powers by the Congress in a secret act to do whatever we see fit with the Navy.

02:17.693 --> 02:22.480
Then I hope you see fit to give me some more money to get these ships in seagoing condition.

02:22.500 --> 02:28.930
I've been trying to get President Houston to send me enough money to get the ships repaired for nearly a year, and I'm still waiting.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.193
To what condition are the ships in now?

02:31.394 --> 02:35.520
I'll tell you, Mr. Bryan, they couldn't be in much worse shape and still stay afloat.

02:35.855 --> 02:40.219
The officers and men have been paid only three times in the last two years.

02:40.239 --> 02:43.942
I don't know how you can expect me to keep a navy going without any money.

02:43.962 --> 02:46.325
What do you advise doing with the ships, Captain?

02:46.365 --> 02:50.368
Go back down to Yucatan, Mr. Bryan, as I should have done two years ago.

02:50.388 --> 02:57.455
As long as Yucatan is fighting for freedom against Santa Ana and his centralist army, we're able to rent them our ships for $8,000 a month.

02:58.216 --> 03:03.060
General Parraza of the Yucatan army just arrived in New Orleans yesterday bringing me some money.

03:03.563 --> 03:06.229
I signed another treaty with him to use our ships.

03:06.249 --> 03:08.334
How many ships could you put into the fight, Captain?

03:08.835 --> 03:13.726
I've got the ship Austin, commanded by Lieutenant Gray, and the brig Wharton by Commander Lothrop.

03:15.249 --> 03:20.261
By the way, just what is in this secret act that the Congress passed?

03:20.281 --> 03:22.686
I'm sorry, but we can't tell you all the provisions.

03:23.037 --> 03:28.535
Brian, I think you and I had better send a letter back to the Secretary of the Navy and ask his advice in this matter.

03:28.555 --> 03:29.879
I think you're right, Morgan.

03:30.019 --> 03:33.992
Well, I hope you gentlemen get more response out of the government than I have.

03:41.633 --> 03:45.317
Well, Captain Moore, we've received instructions from the Secretary of the Navy.

03:45.337 --> 03:47.879
Is it good news or bad, Colonel Morgan?

03:48.200 --> 03:49.141
Bad, I'm afraid.

03:49.701 --> 03:57.149
We've received instructions that we are to suspend you from all command and order you to report an arrest back to the Navy Department.

03:57.169 --> 04:02.254
I might as well tell you, Captain, that President Houston has given us something else to hold over your head if we need it.

04:02.394 --> 04:03.315
What is it?

04:03.335 --> 04:06.838
It's a proclamation declaring that you and all of your men are pirates.

04:06.858 --> 04:11.623
It invites any nation to capture you and return you and your vessels to the port of Galveston for trials.

04:12.447 --> 04:16.511
Of course, we're not supposed to publish this paper unless we find it necessary to bring you to terms.

04:16.931 --> 04:19.513
I might have expected something like this.

04:19.533 --> 04:24.358
If I obey this order and leave the vessels in the port of New Orleans, every officer under me will resign.

04:24.878 --> 04:29.182
The vessels will be left at the mercy of the sailors, who will be sure to mutiny and destroy the ships.

04:29.722 --> 04:33.265
They threatened to do that once before when I couldn't pay them their wages.

04:33.285 --> 04:34.667
What do you think we should do, Brian?

04:35.267 --> 04:38.030
Captain Moore may be right about the ships.

04:38.050 --> 04:40.632
It seems to me we should try to get them back to Galveston.

04:41.067 --> 04:46.573
Then the officers and men could be demobilized there, where we'd have a chance to keep an eye on the ships.

04:46.593 --> 04:48.976
What do you say to Mr. Bryan's suggestion?

04:48.996 --> 04:52.140
Captain, would you promise to take the ships back to Galveston?

04:52.280 --> 04:56.164
Well, it looks as though I'll have to give up my hopes of sailing to Yucatan.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.429
I certainly must tell you, though, I'm doing this against my better judgment.

05:00.449 --> 05:05.435
I believe that an attack on the Mexican Navy would hold off Santa Ana from attempting to come north with another army.

05:06.677 --> 05:07.057
All right.

05:07.357 --> 05:07.678
All right.

05:07.778 --> 05:09.240
I'll take the ships to Galveston.

05:09.300 --> 05:09.520
Good.

05:09.540 --> 05:09.640
Good.

05:09.957 --> 05:12.242
I think that I'll sail along with you.

05:12.262 --> 05:14.147
Save the government the cost of my transportation.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.873
You want to come along by ship two, Brian?

05:17.234 --> 05:18.537
No, I'll go overland.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.882
I never was too much of a sailor.

05:20.902 --> 05:22.405
You go ahead and take the ship back.

05:22.766 --> 05:24.069
When do you think we can get started?

05:24.250 --> 05:28.860
I should say that we should be into the Gulf by April the 15th and standing toward Galveston.

05:37.244 --> 05:38.566
Is that you, Captain Moore?

05:38.746 --> 05:39.207
Yes.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.289
Yes, will you come on up, Colonel Morgan?

05:41.610 --> 05:43.953
I can hardly recognize you in this fog.

05:43.973 --> 05:44.614
Where are we?

05:44.634 --> 05:47.458
We're still standing off bellies.

05:47.478 --> 05:49.200
Is that another schooner I see over there?

05:49.601 --> 05:53.005
Yes, she's the Rosario, three and a half days out of Campeche.

05:53.446 --> 05:58.192
She just anchored there to await the lifting of the fog, and she brings bad tidings from Yucatan.

05:58.693 --> 06:00.355
What's happening in Yucatan now?

06:00.375 --> 06:04.180
The Yucatan Army and Santa Ana are about ready to declare peace with each other.

06:04.548 --> 06:09.936
Then, as soon as Santa Ana can get his forces together, he's going to invade Texas by way of Galveston.

06:09.956 --> 06:13.440
Santa Ana is trying to get the Yucatan army to join him against Texas.

06:14.342 --> 06:15.964
That's a bad situation.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.206
I'm really concerned about it.

06:17.326 --> 06:21.191
It hasn't helped things any to have me sitting in port with the Texas fleet.

06:21.211 --> 06:28.201
You remember I told you that the Yucatan government sent me some money as a rental fee for our fleet and that I signed a treaty with them to blockade the Mexican ports?

06:28.562 --> 06:29.924
Yes, yes, I remember.

06:30.084 --> 06:33.829
Well, they say now that I'm a traitor because I haven't done anything to earn the money.

06:34.214 --> 06:37.899
In fact, the Yucatan government is accusing me of taking a bribe from Santa Ana.

06:38.419 --> 06:42.304
They say that's why I haven't been blockading the Mexican ports for the last two years.

06:42.324 --> 06:46.209
You really think that the Mexican central government will attempt to invade us again then?

06:46.389 --> 06:47.891
Of course I do.

06:47.911 --> 06:50.715
You can talk to the master, the schooner Rosario, yourself if you want to.

06:51.456 --> 06:53.378
If what you say is true, we're in for a fight.

06:53.999 --> 07:01.268
If they would invade Galveston, at the same time start another offensive against San Antonio, we'd be in a worse position than we were at San Jacinto.

07:01.771 --> 07:03.092
What do you think we should do?

07:03.112 --> 07:07.496
As far as I personally am concerned, I'm in arrest and on my way to Galveston.

07:07.716 --> 07:09.297
Oh, come, come now, Captain.

07:09.718 --> 07:11.359
Let's forget that for a moment.

07:11.379 --> 07:13.101
Could we do anything to stop such an attack?

07:13.241 --> 07:15.102
If you want my advice, I'll give it to you.

07:15.783 --> 07:24.931
I don't know what your powers are under this secret act that the 7th Congress passed, but if it gives you the wide powers that I suspect it does, this is what you can do.

07:24.951 --> 07:30.816
Give me permission to sail to Telchak with the Austin and Wharton to engage and destroy the Mexican ship Moctezumi.

07:31.319 --> 07:34.923
It's there with some smaller vessels to take the Mexican army to Yucatan.

07:35.464 --> 07:39.329
Then we can hurry to Campeche and attack the main Mexican squadron there.

07:39.349 --> 07:43.714
I believe that if I start this attack, the smaller Yucatan ships that are in the harbor there will help us.

07:44.014 --> 07:45.055
What effect will that have?

07:45.196 --> 07:52.665
If we can prevent the Mexican army from bringing any more men or supplies to Yucatan, I believe the Yucatan army can capture the Mexican army in Yucatan.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.588
They should be able to keep the Mexican army out after that.

07:56.007 --> 08:00.153
As long as they can do that, they aren't going to make peace with the Mexican central governments.

08:00.173 --> 08:01.175
Blended.

08:01.195 --> 08:05.581
And as long as Yucatan is still fighting them, Mexico won't be able to attack Texas.

08:05.601 --> 08:06.583
That's the way I see it.

08:07.524 --> 08:12.131
I think the situation is sufficiently grave for me to use my full power as naval commissioner.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.755
I say, let's go to Yucatan.

08:14.775 --> 08:19.061
Before I do that, I'm going to take steps to clear my own name.

08:19.081 --> 08:23.668
I assume that President Houston, as soon as he hears about this, will denounce me as a priority.

08:24.323 --> 08:31.794
I'm going to send a letter to the Texas Times by way of the Schooner Rosario, saying that I'm going down to attack the Mexican squadron.

08:31.814 --> 08:37.984
And I'm going to say that I'm going down there with your full consent, as you believe it's the best thing that can be done for the country.

08:38.004 --> 08:38.925
Go ahead.

08:38.945 --> 08:39.847
You have my permission.

08:40.648 --> 08:44.373
I've made up my mind to save the Republic of Texas, if I can.

08:44.393 --> 08:47.378
And I hope we get a chance to strike a blow at the Mexican Navy.

08:55.087 --> 08:58.952
It appears that we'll be able to engage the enemy in a few minutes, Lieutenant Gray.

08:59.212 --> 08:59.593
Yes, sir.

08:59.993 --> 09:02.517
It's unfortunate that we lost the Yucatan ship to Stern.

09:03.017 --> 09:05.921
They couldn't keep up with us when we put on extra sail to catch the Mexicans.

09:06.101 --> 09:07.783
Well, at least they're with us in spirit.

09:08.224 --> 09:09.546
We have the warden with us anyway.

09:10.407 --> 09:14.392
We were lucky in getting the Yucatan Army to start fighting the Mexican Central Government again.

09:14.773 --> 09:17.076
I imagine that was Colonel Morgan's work, wasn't it, Captain?

09:17.116 --> 09:17.756
Yes, it was.

09:18.357 --> 09:19.559
They were mighty pleased to see us.

09:19.879 --> 09:24.385
When the Mexican ship fired on us the other day, it gave them an excuse to stop any peace conferences.

09:25.208 --> 09:28.632
Yeah, Morgan will be able to see the battle today from the waterfront.

09:28.812 --> 09:30.815
The men are ready at their battle stations.

09:30.835 --> 09:32.777
I can begin firing immediately at your command.

09:32.817 --> 09:35.020
Have you identified the Mexican war schooner for certain?

09:35.280 --> 09:36.702
I'm quite sure it's the Ahuela.

09:37.182 --> 09:39.244
The steam frigates are the Moctezuma and Guadalupe.

09:39.505 --> 09:42.809
And we're fortunate they have only three ships today as against our two.

09:43.349 --> 09:46.633
We'll give them a run for their money today, even if we are outgunned.

09:46.653 --> 09:49.176
Have the signalmen stand by for relaying orders to the warden.

09:49.316 --> 09:49.917
Aye, aye, sir.

09:50.521 --> 09:52.749
Signalman, ready at your station.

09:53.290 --> 09:54.033
Aye, aye, sir.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.919
Starboard battery, ready.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.344
Starboard battery, ready.

09:57.886 --> 09:59.552
Starboard battery, fire.

09:59.572 --> 10:01.358
Starboard battery, fire.

10:14.534 --> 10:17.057
Lieutenant Gray, how many times have we been struck?

10:17.077 --> 10:19.481
We've received 17 shots in the hull and rigging.

10:20.062 --> 10:22.064
Most of them are from the Guadalupe's Long 68.

10:22.745 --> 10:23.807
Keep on firing.

10:29.414 --> 10:31.858
Captain, the enemy's steam frigates are grouping closer together.

10:31.938 --> 10:33.119
That's what I've been waiting for.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.483
They are course right between the two of them.

10:35.503 --> 10:39.388
When we get between them, fire both the larboard and the starboard batteries at them.

10:39.408 --> 10:42.432
We'll only have a few seconds of firing, but we'll make the most of it.

10:49.111 --> 10:51.254
Captain Moore, the rigging is in dangerous condition.

10:51.534 --> 10:54.097
With the wind freshening, I'm afraid to risk staying on this course.

10:54.117 --> 10:57.782
If we wear ship to relieve the strain on our rigging, the Mexican ships will get away from it.

10:57.802 --> 11:02.007
That's true, but if we keep on our present course, we'll lose our sails and possibly a mast.

11:02.027 --> 11:04.270
There's nothing else to do then.

11:04.290 --> 11:06.994
Give orders to wear ship and present our larboard batteries.

11:07.014 --> 11:07.454
Aye, aye, sir.

11:13.342 --> 11:13.482
The End

11:15.790 --> 11:18.072
Captain, I believe the Mexican ships are drawing away.

11:18.613 --> 11:19.774
Looks as if they had all they want.

11:20.075 --> 11:21.977
Well, we'll have to let them go.

11:21.997 --> 11:23.698
We can't chase them with our rigging gone.

11:24.399 --> 11:29.224
I can't understand why they don't just stay out of range and peck away at us with their 68-pounder.

11:29.525 --> 11:31.767
It has twice the range of our 24-pounder.

11:31.787 --> 11:33.990
I guess they've just decided they don't want to fight anymore.

11:34.370 --> 11:35.231
We got them bluffed out.

11:35.351 --> 11:38.314
Yes, I think we'll be able to come and go as we please now.

11:39.215 --> 11:42.098
Signal Commander Lothrop of the Wharton that he's not to chase them.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.662
We'll go on back to Compeche and see how Colonel Morgan liked the fight.

11:52.375 --> 11:57.541
Colonel Morgan brought word that President Houston had denounced them all as pirates.

11:57.561 --> 11:59.083
But he had good news, too.

11:59.504 --> 12:02.507
Santa Ana was withdrawing all his forces from Yucatan.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.870
The naval attack had been a success.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.324
Commodore Moore and the Texas Navy returned to Texas.

12:16.344 --> 12:20.509
He requested a trial by court-martial to prove his innocence of the piracy charged.

12:21.012 --> 12:27.761
But he was so popular with the Texans living along the coast that the Texas government was not anxious to press charges.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.964
Finally, the trial was held.

12:29.984 --> 12:34.811
Moore was acquitted of all charges except that of disobedience to orders.

12:34.831 --> 12:38.436
The Texas Navy was never used against the Mexican government again.

12:39.016 --> 12:41.620
The ships were either sold or broken up.

12:42.140 --> 12:52.194
Eventually, an appropriation of $20,000 was made by Texas to reimburse Commodore Moore for back pay and for the money he had personally advanced to operate the fleet.

12:53.015 --> 12:56.499
And so ends the story of the Texas Navy.

13:05.391 --> 13:06.713
In those early days...

13:06.929 --> 13:10.935
Ships were built largely of stout wooden planks and timbers.

13:10.955 --> 13:13.379
Wood was used in nearly every part of a ship.

13:13.980 --> 13:21.692
Today, wood remains an important material in shipping, with thousands of feet of lumber being used in the construction of steel ships.

13:21.712 --> 13:26.479
More than 300,000 feet of lumber go into the ways for the building of a large cargo ship.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.463
Many small boats are built largely of wood.

13:30.325 --> 13:31.867
According to Director W.E.

13:31.947 --> 13:33.730
