00:00.000 --> 00:14.274
[Music.]

00:14.274 --> 00:16.706
Talking By Wire.

00:19.551 --> 00:19.951
Hello?

00:20.593 --> 00:23.472
This is the Texas Forest Service of A&M College calling...

00:23.472 --> 00:41.942 
[Music.]

00:41.942 --> 00:46.323
75 years ago, Texans were without many of the conveniences of today.

00:46.864 --> 00:48.887
Motor cars were unknown.

00:48.907 --> 00:54.095
Airplanes, sound motion pictures, and radio broadcasting were almost undreamed of.

00:54.115 --> 00:56.278
And even the commoner facilities were missing.

00:56.839 --> 00:58.962
Take, for instance, communication.

00:59.380 --> 01:10.490
When the housewife wanted to order groceries, call a physician, or tell a choice bit of gossip to her friends, she must either send her young son down with a message or get ready for visiting in sally forth herself.

01:11.251 --> 01:18.958
Most business houses depended upon errand boys to carry orders, requests, and information to their customers and associates in the same town.

01:19.699 --> 01:25.764
And newspapers depended upon their reporters getting to the scene of news stories by foot or by horse.

01:25.784 --> 01:28.527
But some of the newspaper editors were not satisfied.

01:28.962 --> 01:40.795
One morning in the year 1876, in a newspaper office in Galveston, the two partners, Colonel Alfred H. Below and Willard Richardson, were just starting work for the day.

01:42.040 --> 01:47.004
Alfred, I see we've got a news story on this new invention by a man named Elisha Gray.

01:47.485 --> 01:50.387
That's what he calls the telephone, isn't it?

01:50.407 --> 01:52.629
Yes, we're running the article in today's paper.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.691
Gray's from Chicago, isn't he?

01:54.911 --> 01:55.632
So it says.

01:56.213 --> 02:02.538
I've read where Thomas Edison and a fellow named Bell have been working on the same thing, a way of talking over wires.

02:03.279 --> 02:05.541
I guess it isn't too far-fetched at that.

02:06.221 --> 02:10.225
A hundred years ago, who would have believed there would be such a thing as the telegraph?

02:10.795 --> 02:12.958
And now we're getting a chance to use it every day.

02:13.559 --> 02:18.527
Well, the wonderful discoveries of the last 50 years have almost prepared us to believe anything.

02:19.208 --> 02:27.161
But we must admit that we're being put to a strong test when we're called upon to believe that the sound of a human voice can be sent over the wires.

02:27.181 --> 02:34.913
Well, I don't know very much about electricity, but I'm willing to bet that someday we'll actually be able to talk into one of those instruments...

02:35.213 --> 02:38.837
and make ourselves understood to anybody who owns one.

02:38.857 --> 02:40.940
I don't see any practical good out of it, though.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.102
We have telegraph lines now.

02:43.823 --> 02:48.789
If you want to send a message to another town, we run down to the telegraph office and give them the message.

02:49.330 --> 02:53.775
How much better off will we be if we hear the man talk when we get there?

02:53.795 --> 02:59.101
I grant you that it would be interesting to hear the man's voice, but I can't see any special advantage.

02:59.561 --> 03:02.605
But what if you didn't have to go down to the telegraph office?

03:03.142 --> 03:07.367
I'll wager that someday people will have this telephone in their own homes.

03:08.068 --> 03:11.012
You wouldn't need a telegraph operator to send the message for you.

03:11.032 --> 03:14.376
You'd just speak on the telephone to the person yourself.

03:14.396 --> 03:16.399
I don't see how it would work out.

03:16.419 --> 03:18.502
Think of how many wires you'd have to string up.

03:19.062 --> 03:22.126
You'd have to arrange for wires to everyone you wanted to talk to.

03:22.527 --> 03:27.293
I think they'll probably have some kind of an arrangement like they do now in telegraph stations.

03:28.066 --> 03:35.033
They could have a central point where a wire to one person's house could be connected with the wire running to somebody else's house.

03:35.053 --> 03:40.779
Or if you wanted to talk to some other town where the telephone people could connect you to the wire leading to the other town.

03:41.279 --> 03:45.363
Well, it may work, but I still think it's stretching the imagination a little.

03:46.084 --> 03:48.887
Think of what it would mean for the newspaper man.

03:48.907 --> 03:58.056
If I wanted to get the facts for a newspaper article, all I'd have to do would be to telephone the people concerned at their homes or business houses and verify the story.

03:58.627 --> 04:01.330
Save sending a correspondent over to write the article.

04:02.010 --> 04:04.453
I can see all the money it would save us and time.

04:04.773 --> 04:08.417
Don't you think it would be too expensive for most people to afford?

04:08.437 --> 04:13.161
Well, if enough people would pay for the service, I should think it could be quite reasonable in price.

04:14.162 --> 04:18.647
I know that if they ever bring any telephones to Galveston, I'm going to have one put in my house.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.749
What about the telegraph?

04:20.769 --> 04:24.332
I'm just getting used to it now, and you're ready to tell me it's old-fashioned.

04:24.713 --> 04:28.296
I think the telegraph will become even more useful as time goes on.

04:28.681 --> 04:31.424
and I don't think the telephone will replace it.

04:31.444 --> 04:38.791
A telegraph will probably be more accurate, and especially for business firms, it'll be very useful because they'll have a written record of the messages.

04:39.432 --> 04:45.098
But I think the telephone will be mighty handy around town, especially when you want to talk to somebody yourself.

04:45.478 --> 04:50.043
Well, I'm not such an old man yet, and I'm going to say we won't make any more progress.

04:50.744 --> 04:57.591
But if you ever get one of those things put in your house, and if I'm still around, I want to be the first person to talk to you.

04:57.591 --> 05:05.958
[Music.]

05:05.958 --> 05:08.782
Nettie, do you think you can spare me for a month or so?

05:09.143 --> 05:09.964
Why, Alfred?

05:10.304 --> 05:12.367
Do you plan on making a business trip?

05:12.387 --> 05:14.611
I've half of mind to go up to Philadelphia.

05:15.212 --> 05:21.841
They're having the centennial exposition up there, you know, and I think it'd be well if I went up to see what's going on in the world now.

05:22.102 --> 05:23.764
I think it would be nice if you went.

05:24.183 --> 05:25.966
Would you like another cup of coffee?

05:26.347 --> 05:27.108
Yes, please.

05:27.729 --> 05:32.877
You know, they've been sending us a lot of stories about some of the new inventions, and I'd like to see them myself.

05:33.678 --> 05:37.024
I believe a newspaper man should know a little something of what he's writing.

05:37.705 --> 05:38.967
You go along if you like.

05:39.288 --> 05:40.690
No, you go ahead and go.

05:41.291 --> 05:47.361
I have enough to do now to keep me busy, and I'll get a lot more done if you're out from under my feet for a while.

05:47.882 --> 05:49.925
But just don't stay away too long.

05:49.925 --> 06:19.178 
[Music.]

--> 06:21.882
Come in and get your fortune told, Madame Olga

06:21.922 --> 06:25.228
Will tell you past, present and future right this way, mister.

06:25.248 --> 06:26.370
Not just now, thanks.

06:28.914 --> 06:33.461
Get them while they're hot.

06:33.481 --> 06:35.364
Tend the sweet corn on the cob.

06:35.384 --> 06:37.928
Guaranteed to get butter smeared from one ear to the other.

06:38.309 --> 06:39.150
Have one, mister?

06:39.491 --> 06:40.272
No, thank you.

06:40.512 --> 06:46.502
[Music.]

06:47.208 --> 06:49.371
And under one of those shells is a small black pea.

06:49.432 --> 06:53.458
And to the lady or gentleman who tells me under which shell it is, I will give five silver dollars.

06:53.578 --> 06:55.301
I repeat, five silver dollars.

06:56.062 --> 06:57.745
How about you trying your luck, sport?

06:57.785 --> 06:58.626
No, thanks.

06:58.646 --> 07:01.330
But can you tell me where the telephone is being exhibited?

07:01.350 --> 07:02.532
Straight ahead on the left side.

07:02.873 --> 07:06.747
And now, ladies and gents, I repeat, if any of you can point out to me which one of these...

07:06.747 --> 07:12.672
[Music.]

07:12.672 --> 07:18.602
In this tent you will see one of the marvels of the century, a demonstration of the telephone.

07:18.943 --> 07:22.529
You will actually see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears.

07:22.629 --> 07:24.052
I'd like a ticket, please.

07:24.072 --> 07:24.733
Oh, yes, sir.

07:24.813 --> 07:25.655
Here you are, mister.

07:25.975 --> 07:33.448
And another gentleman is just going in to witness the marvel of the century, a demonstration of the telephone on which you can actually talk to another.

07:33.448 --> 07:46.408
[Music.]

07:47.671 --> 07:49.092
Good morning, Mr. Below.

07:49.192 --> 07:49.653
You're next.

07:49.953 --> 07:50.774
Good morning, Lem.

07:51.154 --> 07:51.975
Shave as usual.

07:52.095 --> 07:53.196
Yes, sir, and a shave it is.

07:53.717 --> 07:56.480
I just now got through putting another cake of soap in your shaving mug.

07:56.900 --> 08:00.203
Yes, I always try to keep all of my customers' mugs in apple pie order.

08:00.443 --> 08:01.004
Good enough.

08:01.464 --> 08:03.026
How's the family these days, Lem?

08:03.046 --> 08:04.708
Oh, fine, fine.

08:04.728 --> 08:06.950
Say, I heard you just now got back from Philadelphia.

08:07.170 --> 08:08.651
Yes, I got back yesterday.

08:08.811 --> 08:10.974
Must have been a mighty fine celebration they had up there, huh?

08:11.434 --> 08:13.476
Yes, I had a very pleasant time.

08:13.895 --> 08:16.479
I saw some new inventions that really took my eye.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.142
Lean right back there, Mr. Below.

08:18.924 --> 08:19.485
Ah, there you are.

08:20.306 --> 08:23.251
Somebody said you saw this here new telephone work up there.

08:23.491 --> 08:24.313
Yes, I did.

08:24.333 --> 08:28.720
I'm going to get one in my house as soon as I can so I can talk to the office.

08:29.241 --> 08:32.106
It'll probably be a year or two before I can get the material.

08:32.407 --> 08:33.248
I'm gonna have it.

08:33.649 --> 08:34.310
You don't mean it.

08:34.771 --> 08:36.955
Well, I can't understand how in the world it can work.

08:37.256 --> 08:40.782
They say all you have to do is run some wire, like in the telegraph, and you can talk.

08:41.062 --> 08:41.683
Is that right?

08:41.703 --> 08:42.565
That's right.

08:42.585 --> 08:46.652
And what I can't understand is how they're going to run wires all around to carry the talking.

08:46.902 --> 08:50.587
I'll bet it'll take a million wood poles to carry those wires all over.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.630
Don't sound practical to me.

08:52.870 --> 08:56.816
Well, I think we have all the timber we need in East Texas for poles.

08:56.856 --> 08:57.898
Maybe so, maybe so.

08:58.398 --> 09:05.008
Of course, I don't mean to argue with you, but I doubt if I ever live to see the day when you can talk to anybody around without ever going out of your house.

09:05.028 --> 09:09.354
Well, I'm not going to argue with you either, as long as you've got that razor in your hand.

09:09.354 --> 09:16.504
[Music.]

09:17.142 --> 09:20.707
How long will it be before we can try out this telephone, Alfred?

09:20.727 --> 09:25.253
It should be just a few minutes, as soon as these men get through connecting up the wires outside.

09:25.634 --> 09:27.016
How do you make it work?

09:27.036 --> 09:28.137
Do you think I can do it?

09:28.257 --> 09:30.220
Why, there's nothing to it, Nettie.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.744
All you have to do is crank this little knob.

09:32.764 --> 09:35.087
It makes the bell ring on the other end.

09:35.107 --> 09:40.715
Then you just lift up this little thing, oh, by the way, it's called a receiver, and talk into the mouthpiece.

09:41.216 --> 09:45.141
Then you put the receiver against your ear, and you hear the other person talk.

09:45.273 --> 09:48.336
Is the mayor going to be down to the newspaper office to try it out?

09:48.536 --> 09:50.718
Yes, he said he wanted to talk over it.

09:50.738 --> 09:53.481
I understand there are going to be quite a few other people down there, too.

09:54.102 --> 09:57.305
But the one I want to talk to is Will Richardson.

09:57.325 --> 10:06.414
A couple of years ago, before I went to the Centennial in Philadelphia, he said that if I ever got one of these things in my house, he wanted to be the first to talk to me.

10:06.434 --> 10:13.120
You know, Alfred, I was just thinking, if some of the other women around here had telephones in their houses,

10:13.522 --> 10:19.048
I could talk to them as long as I wanted without ever having to get dressed up for visiting.

10:19.528 --> 10:24.253
I can see where the telephone is going to be very popular with the women folks.

10:25.394 --> 10:26.896
It's all ready to go, Colonel.

10:27.016 --> 10:28.518
We have the wires connected.

10:28.838 --> 10:30.960
Well, here we go, Nettie, and I hope it works.

10:31.561 --> 10:36.606
I hate to think what Richardson's going to say if it doesn't.

10:36.626 --> 10:37.026
Hello?

10:37.847 --> 10:38.228
Hello?

10:40.250 --> 10:41.411
Oh, nobody answers.

10:41.431 --> 10:42.432
I'll try ringing again.

10:43.913 --> 10:45.555
Just a minute there, Colonel.

10:45.575 --> 10:47.016
This wire's come loose again.

10:47.096 --> 10:48.438
We'll have it fixed in a jiffy.

10:48.778 --> 10:49.179
All right.

10:49.999 --> 10:51.261
I hope they get it working this time.

10:51.361 --> 10:52.582
Patience, Alfred.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.025
I'm sure they'll get it ready right away.

10:55.525 --> 10:56.446
All ready, Colonel.

10:56.466 --> 10:56.967
Below.

10:57.027 --> 10:57.908
Will you try it now?

10:58.268 --> 10:58.669
All right.

11:01.732 --> 11:02.112
Hello?

11:02.733 --> 11:03.073
Hello?

11:04.635 --> 11:04.995
Hello?

11:05.696 --> 11:06.737
Is that you, Richardson?

11:07.598 --> 11:08.219
What's that?

11:08.239 --> 11:09.080
What does he say?

11:09.620 --> 11:11.662
He says I'm hollering too loud in his ear.

11:12.343 --> 11:13.144
Hello, Richardson.

11:13.681 --> 11:15.504
What do you think of the invention now?

11:17.286 --> 11:19.790
Pretty good, isn't it?

11:19.810 --> 11:25.097
Yes, and I'll bet it isn't long until every newspaper in the country will have one.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.299
That's what I said.

11:26.319 --> 11:26.739
Alfred.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.223
Just a second, Richardson.

11:29.243 --> 11:30.344
Hold on for a second.

11:31.005 --> 11:32.788
My wife wants to ask me something.

11:33.549 --> 11:34.170
What is it, Nettie?

11:34.450 --> 11:35.892
It just came to me, Alfred.

11:36.533 --> 11:39.437
Now I can call you home when it's time for supper.

11:40.959 --> 11:49.523
[Music.]

11:49.523 --> 11:59.222
This was the story of the first telephone line in Texas.

11:59.242 --> 12:04.532
In the year 1878, Colonel Alfred H. Below made the first telephone call in the state.

12:05.173 --> 12:12.207
Credit for the invention of the telephone was finally given to Alexander Graham Bell, whose first patents date from 1876.

12:12.558 --> 12:18.205
but the pioneering work of Elisha Gray, Thomas A. Edison, and others is recognized.

12:18.225 --> 12:28.377
The first telephone exchange in Texas was opened in Galveston on August 21, 1879, and the first long-distance line was between Galveston and Houston in 1883.

12:28.477 --> 12:35.866
Today, there are more than a thousand telephone exchanges in the state, with nearly a million telephones.

12:35.886 --> 12:38.329
Telephone lines use a lot of telephone poles.

12:38.731 --> 12:48.763
Millions of telephone poles produced in East Texas go into the state's extensive telephone system, helping to carry the messages which bind the state so closely together.

12:49.464 --> 12:54.631
These telephone poles are an important source of income to East Texas timberland owners.

12:54.651 --> 12:56.553
Poles bring a high price on the market.

12:57.034 --> 13:03.642
Timberland owners who selectively cut pole material from their pine stands usually make money from their timber crop.

13:03.959 --> 13:10.848
By practicing good forestry, they can keep their timberlands continually producing timber for the industries of the state.

13:10.848 --> 13:15.894
[Music.]

13:19.894 --> 13:24.855
A constant supply of timber can build a greater Texas.

13:24.855 --> 13:35.566
[Music.]

13:35.566 --> 13:41.014
This transcription has been brought to you by the Texas Forest Service of A&M College, W.E.

13:41.074 --> 13:46.382
White director, as a part of the public service activities of the radio station to which you are listening.

13:47.063 --> 13:48.766
