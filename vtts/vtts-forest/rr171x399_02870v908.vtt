Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear Hello there, folks.

00:10.512 --> 00:14.458
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:15.220 --> 00:21.329
Those singing friends of mine, the sons of the pioneers, have a song for you.

00:21.349 --> 00:26.718
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:27.199 --> 00:29.262
Today it's Ward Bond.

00:29.545 --> 00:35.051
And here we are, sitting in the shade of a covered wagon out on the plains.

00:35.632 --> 00:38.636
Mr. Bond, it's good of you to let us visit.

00:39.377 --> 00:45.243
You know, Smokey, getting around the way I do, I've seen some mighty big forest and prairie fires.

00:45.944 --> 00:54.635
They got started in every case because some farmer or rancher was careless in clearing land or in burning the brush or debris.

00:55.295 --> 00:57.578
A little horse sense would have prevented those fires,

00:58.098 --> 01:01.501
Those folks should have plowed a good fire line around the area.

01:02.162 --> 01:06.447
They should have had some help at hand and a supply of water, as well as the proper tools.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.169
They should have waited until the weather was right.

01:09.730 --> 01:14.655
And some of them, as they sadly realize now, should have checked on the law.

01:14.675 --> 01:19.940
In many cases, you need to get a burning permit from your local fire warden or your ranger.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.644
The cost of fighting those fires and the damage they did came high.

01:24.145 --> 01:27.328
It's too bad that some folks always have to learn the hard way.

01:27.646 --> 01:28.988
Thanks, Mr. Bond.

01:29.709 --> 01:37.820
I sure hope folks will really take your message to heart and be careful when they burn brush and other debris.

01:37.840 --> 01:45.430
Now, before you move on with your wagon train, the Sons of the Pioneers here have an appropriate song for you.

01:45.450 --> 01:48.574
It's called Chant of the Plains.

01:53.633 --> 02:21.733
I need you.

02:22.068 --> 02:24.270
Far in the distance, hear that note.

02:24.350 --> 02:31.677
It's born of a call in a savage throat who waits a mate's reply.

02:31.737 --> 02:33.879
Listen to the moaning of the wind on its way.

02:33.899 --> 02:36.142
Everything he touches, see it bend and sway.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.424
Seem to pledge your love and send him on his way.

02:38.444 --> 02:44.109
That's why I need you.

02:46.051 --> 02:49.915
All through the prairie I wander.

02:50.452 --> 02:53.678
Night falls and I long for you.

02:55.461 --> 03:04.899
Everything here in God's garden shares my longing too.

03:04.919 --> 03:07.123
Listen to the prairie weave a song from a whale.

03:07.263 --> 03:09.447
Listen to him blend up with a nightingale.

03:09.507 --> 03:12.493
Winging up a ball for the dark clouds sail and fly.

03:17.671 --> 03:27.006
Listen to the rhythm of the padded feet Stealing through the desert hear his wild heartbeat Searching for his love and my heart repeats his cry

03:32.572 --> 03:34.874
Far in the distance, hear that note.

03:34.894 --> 03:37.877
It's born of a call in a savage throat who waits.

03:38.438 --> 03:42.141
A mate's reply.

03:42.161 --> 03:44.143
Listen to the moaning of the wind on its way.

03:44.523 --> 03:46.465
Everything he touches, see it bend and sway.

03:46.706 --> 03:48.727
Seen to pledge your love and send him on his way.

03:48.748 --> 03:54.053
That's why I need you.

03:58.497 --> 04:00.739
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:00.938 --> 04:03.742
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:03.762 --> 04:09.169
You know it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:09.229 --> 04:14.997
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:15.718 --> 04:30.658
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and range fires.

04:30.638 --> 04:39.411
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowling and a-growling and a-sit in the air.

04:39.952 --> 04:43.978
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

04:44.358 --> 04:48.985
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:57.352 --> 04:58.718
.

04:58.738 --> 05:05.505
