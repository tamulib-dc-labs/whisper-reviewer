00:03.710 --> 00:07.662
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:08.664 --> 00:10.028
Hello there, folks.

00:10.570 --> 00:14.682
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:14.780 --> 00:20.008
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:20.409 --> 00:26.038
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:26.499 --> 00:29.864
Today it's... Say, who are you today, Red?

00:30.245 --> 00:31.286
Freddy the Freeloader?

00:31.667 --> 00:32.709
Clem Cadiddlehopper?

00:33.129 --> 00:33.991
Willie Lump Lump?

00:34.632 --> 00:37.136
No, Smokey, you'll have to settle for Red Skelton.

00:37.156 --> 00:39.660
A guy that loves the outdoors and everything that goes with it.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.783
The green grass, the trees.

00:42.083 --> 00:45.028
the water running clear and the wild animals and the birds.

00:45.608 --> 00:53.100
And every time I hear or read about a forest burning, I'm sure most people feel the same about this as I do.

00:53.841 --> 01:02.174
The most important thing for all of us, for each and every one of us, to lend a helping hand in keeping forests clear from fires.

01:02.194 --> 01:10.707
As I see it, well, it's kind of a personal responsibility that goes along with being an American, to be careful with fires outdoors, with our matches,

01:11.058 --> 01:14.544
or smokes, with campfires, any fire.

01:15.085 --> 01:16.869
It's a very serious business, Smokey.

01:17.450 --> 01:20.215
Forest fires is no joking matter.

01:20.235 --> 01:21.537
Thanks, Mr. Skelton.

01:22.058 --> 01:26.587
Now Lloyd Perryman and the Sons of the Pioneers want a word with you.

01:27.168 --> 01:29.792
Fred, have you ever been to a cowboy jubilee?

01:30.514 --> 01:32.057
We think you'd like it.

01:32.077 --> 01:33.960
Hey, just listen, and we'll show you what we mean.

01:37.990 --> 01:45.497
Come on and throw away your troubles, cast them to the moon, and sell all your birdies for free.

01:45.517 --> 01:49.440
Cause there's a great day coming, can't you hear them all humming?

01:49.460 --> 01:53.023
It's a Cowboy Jubilee.

01:53.043 --> 02:07.356
If you've got lots of leisure time and nothing else to do, and want to be happy as we, just grab your hat, get your boots on pretty soon, you'll be long gone to the Cowboy Jubilee.

02:07.336 --> 02:30.272
Just hear that cowboy band a-playin.' You know your blues won't mean a thing when you get in the swing. A cowboy's life is for me. Soon all you care's you'll be sheddin' And like me you'll be headin' to that cowboy jubilee.

02:30.272 --> 03:00.977
[Music.]

03:00.977 --> 03:03.364
Just hear that cowboy band a-playing

03:03.800 --> 03:31.294
See the couples out there swaying. You know your cruise won't mean a thing When you get in the swing. A cowboy's life is for me. Soon all you care is you'll be shedding And like me you'll be heading To the Cowboy Jubilee. Cowboy Jubilee. Thanks, fellas.

03:31.314 --> 03:33.216
You know, I was just thinking

03:33.466 --> 03:35.548
about what Red Skelton said.

03:36.589 --> 03:39.792
Forest fires are no joking matter.

03:40.533 --> 03:42.975
Believe me, that's right.

03:42.995 --> 03:46.058
Forest fires are serious business.

03:47.219 --> 03:49.522
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:50.182 --> 03:52.725
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:53.506 --> 03:59.391
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

03:59.411 --> 04:03.135
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to.

04:03.385 --> 04:06.308
that make these get-togethers possible.

04:06.328 --> 04:25.289
So until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:25.629 --> 04:30.034
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear,

04:30.250 --> 04:34.997
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:35.017 --> 04:39.104
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:39.164 --> 04:41.507
That's why they call him Smokey.

04:41.527 --> 04:43.891
That was how he got his name.

04:43.891--> 05:03.719
Ooh.
