Hello there, folks.

00:10.809 --> 00:14.353
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:14.894 --> 00:20.081
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:20.622 --> 00:25.989
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:26.589 --> 00:31.776
Today it's that family man, Ozzie Nelson, who feels very strongly

00:32.161 --> 00:34.303
about his weekends in the country.

00:34.824 --> 00:37.527
Yes, sir, Smokey, and that goes for all the Nelsons.

00:37.828 --> 00:39.510
Harriet, David, Ricky, and me.

00:40.411 --> 00:47.939
Ever since the boys were little fellas, we've headed for the outdoors every weekend we could make it, and the heavy traffic never stopped us.

00:47.959 --> 00:53.085
We're kind of a camping-out family, and it's helped keep us close together through the years.

00:53.105 --> 00:57.791
It's also developed in each one of us the good habit of always being careful with fire outdoors.

00:58.932 --> 01:01.375
When the boys were younger, we used to make a game of it.

01:01.844 --> 01:07.091
Everybody checking up on everybody else to make sure no one was careless with his match or the campfire.

01:07.992 --> 01:17.145
We've seen the results of fire running wild, Smokey, and we prefer the beautiful, green, productive forest to black ghosts of trees on an ugly landscape.

01:17.986 --> 01:20.850
I'm sure every weekend camper feels the same way.

01:20.870 --> 01:22.171
Thank you, Ozzie Nelson.

01:22.852 --> 01:30.703
Now the Sons of the Pioneers here have a song about another kind of ghost and about... Well, you tell them, Lloyd...

01:31.038 --> 01:34.004
Mr. Nelson, you mentioned weekend traffic.

01:34.024 --> 01:48.192
That reminds us of the heavy traffic on the trails years ago when great clouds of dust rolled upwards to the sky.

01:48.212 --> 01:52.962
Rolling dust, rolling dust, rolling dust, rolling dust.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.911
Rollin' dust, rollin' dust, rollin' dust.

02:04.931 --> 02:09.862
They ride along the fading trails of long, long of gold.

02:10.583 --> 02:15.895
And sparks of hoofbeats glitter in the shadows as they go.

02:16.313 --> 02:30.023
Out across the backlands where the dust has laid so long, you'll see them loping through the night and hear their writing song.

02:30.043 --> 02:32.348
Rolling dust, rolling dust, rolling dust.

02:35.163 --> 02:56.935
The years are long and many since they rode down into town It's now just weeds and wormy boards and shacks all tumble down For once they stood up to the bar and pretty girls discussed

02:56.915 --> 03:04.117
They now hear ghostly laughter through a veil of heavy dust.

03:04.137 --> 03:07.988
Rolling dust, rolling dust, rolling dust.

03:11.056 --> 03:32.558
you see them in the history books or in the cloudy sky their fame will live forever their ghost will never die plunging through the night winds they ride because they must

03:33.213 --> 04:02.038
Oh, deep down in some lonely grave They long since turned to die Rollin' dust, rollin' dust Rollin' dust, rollin' dust Rollin' dust, rollin' dust Rollin' dust, rollin' dust Rollin' dust

04:04.094 --> 04:06.277
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:06.297 --> 04:08.661
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:08.681 --> 04:14.068
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:14.108 --> 04:20.037
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:20.057 --> 04:28.549
Until we say hello there again, this is Smokey and his pals, the sons of the pioneers, asking you to always remember...

04:28.883 --> 04:32.807
Only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:32.827 --> 04:37.011
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

04:37.592 --> 04:41.556
Crowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:42.276 --> 04:46.400
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:46.420 --> 04:51.145
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:54.729 --> 04:55.009
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

04:58.735 --> 04:59.076
.

04:59.096 --> 04:59.498
.

04:59.598 --> 05:09.049
