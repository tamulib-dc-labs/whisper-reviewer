00:00.000 --> 00:09.127
[Silence.]

00:09.127 --> 00:13.163
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:13.919 --> 00:15.661
Hello there, folks.

00:15.681 --> 00:19.505
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:20.146 --> 00:25.531
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:25.952 --> 00:31.197
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:31.738 --> 00:39.406
Today, it's a fellow who rides high in the saddle, a big man and a fine actor, George Montgomery.

00:40.187 --> 00:41.428
Well, hello there, Smokey.

00:42.050 --> 00:46.617
Say, Smokey, when are you going to do something about these range fires that we've been having?

00:47.278 --> 00:54.128
You know, it seems to me that they're just as important to keep these wildfires off the range as it is to keep them out of the woods and forest.

00:55.009 --> 01:02.661
Well, you know, I've seen thousands of acres of good grassland go up in smoke just because someone was careless with a match or a cigarette.

01:03.722 --> 01:06.927
You know, fire doesn't respect anything once it gets going.

01:07.666 --> 01:16.779
I've known range fires to kill livestock, destroy supplies of hay and grain, burn down ranch buildings, or even take human lives.

01:18.001 --> 01:20.364
You know, you'd think that folks would be a lot more careful, wouldn't you?

01:21.245 --> 01:22.647
Well, what's your answer to that, Smokey?

01:22.988 --> 01:25.692
You've just given it, Mr. Montgomery.

01:25.712 --> 01:30.258
Folks have got to be more careful with fire outdoors.

01:30.278 --> 01:32.421
Now the boys here have a song for you.

01:32.722 --> 01:33.623
Go ahead, Lloyd.

01:34.193 --> 01:36.965
Here's a little reminder of the days when you rode the range.

01:37.588 --> 01:40.018
All right, boys, let's yippee-yi, yippee-yo.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.885
I was born to the saddle.

01:48.186 --> 01:50.709
I'll die punching cattle, I know.

01:50.929 --> 01:53.513
Yippee-i, yippee-oh, yippee-oh.

01:53.833 --> 01:55.836
I'll roam on forever.

01:55.856 --> 01:58.319
My home is wherever I go.

01:58.579 --> 02:01.423
Yippee-i, yippee-oh, yippee-oh.

02:01.443 --> 02:08.773
If the grass gets too short and the water hose dry, I'll stay in the saddle and root hog or die.

02:09.193 --> 02:14.100
I'm heading my pony for old Arizona goodbye.

02:14.140 --> 02:15.962
Yippee-i, yippee-oh, yippee-oh.

02:15.942 --> 02:18.590
I was born to the saddle.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.255
I'll ride till I die.

02:20.535 --> 02:26.172
The night heard the cattle way up in the sky.

02:27.029 --> 02:30.554
When the last trail is traveled, it won't matter then.

02:31.074 --> 02:34.699
I'll live in the memory of places I've been.

02:34.879 --> 02:37.503
Yippee-yi, yippee-yo, yippee-yo.

02:37.743 --> 02:39.565
I was born to the saddle.

02:39.786 --> 02:42.749
I'll die punching cattle, I know.

02:42.770 --> 02:45.553
Yippee-yi, yippee-yo, yippee-yo.

02:45.573 --> 02:47.315
I'll roam on forever.

02:47.536 --> 02:50.239
My home is wherever I go.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.362
Yippee-yi, yippee-yo, yippee-yo.

02:52.342 --> 03:00.615
If the grass gets too short and the water holds right, I'll stay in the saddle and root hog or die.

03:01.015 --> 03:08.527
I'm heading my pony for old Arizona goodbye.

03:08.667 --> 03:18.062
Now you take the cities with mansions and homes, all crowded together with no room to roam.

03:18.818 --> 03:26.891
And I'll take the ranges, the tall prairie hay, and mountains a hundred and ten miles away.

03:27.432 --> 03:29.315
Yippee-i, yippee-o, yippee-o.

03:29.495 --> 03:34.323
I was born to the saddle, I'll die punchin' cattle, I know.

03:34.383 --> 03:37.168
Yippee-i, yippee-o, yippee-o.

03:37.328 --> 03:42.136
I'll roam on forever, my home is wherever I go.

03:42.216 --> 03:43.999
Yippee-i, yippee-o.

03:44.890 --> 03:52.488
If the grass gets too short and the water holds dry, I'll stay in the saddle and root hog or die.

03:52.909 --> 03:59.524
I'm head my pony for old Arizona goodbye.

04:03.419 --> 04:05.223
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.069
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:08.550 --> 04:14.163
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:14.243 --> 04:20.517
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:20.497 --> 04:40.311
So, until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the sons of the pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and range fires.

04:40.443 --> 04:49.876
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:49.896 --> 04:53.961
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

04:54.362 --> 04:59.008
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:59.008 --> 05:06.000
[Music.]
