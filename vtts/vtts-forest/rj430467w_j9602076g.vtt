00:03.490 --> 00:07.515
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:08.196 --> 00:09.497
Hello there, folks.

00:09.898 --> 00:13.182
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:13.582 --> 00:18.528
Those singing friends of mine, the sons of the pioneers, have a song for you.

00:18.928 --> 00:23.434
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:23.954 --> 00:27.719
Today, it's a wonderful friend of mine, Roy Rogers.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.342
And here he comes now.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.173
Well, welcome to the ranch, Smokey.

00:35.534 --> 00:40.240
Seems to me that the last time we got together was at Madison Square Garden when I had the rodeo there.

00:40.460 --> 00:48.030
Yes, and you took time out to talk to a lot of boys and girls about forest fire prevention.

00:48.050 --> 00:52.256
I just want to tell you, Roy, how much good your words have helped.

00:53.117 --> 00:53.798
Every day.

00:54.014 --> 01:01.086
More and more boys and girls, and grown-ups too, are enlisting in the battle against forest fires.

01:01.326 --> 01:02.488
Well, that's what it takes, Smokey.

01:02.889 --> 01:04.512
Everyone pitching in to prevent them.

01:05.153 --> 01:16.191
Every year, wildfires burn up millions of our trees, they damage our valuable watersheds, they destroy the food and homes of wildlife, and they desecrate the God-given beauty of our great outdoors.

01:16.171 --> 01:19.581
You know, Smokey, I've thought a great deal about this.

01:19.601 --> 01:28.806
When we're careless with fire, when we let it run wild and become its slave rather than to remain its master, we do ourselves and others a great injustice.

01:28.826 --> 01:30.130
It's really kind of sinful.

01:30.582 --> 01:37.135
If all of us would just think about it in this way, maybe we could have a lot fewer forest fires starting through carelessness.

01:37.276 --> 01:38.157
Thank you, Roy.

01:38.518 --> 01:47.376
Now, here are your singing pals, the sons of the pioneers, with an old favorite, Cowboy Camp Meeting.

01:50.950 --> 02:08.807

03:49.443 --> 03:51.747
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:52.448 --> 03:54.951
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:55.353 --> 04:01.519
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:01.579 --> 04:08.625
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:08.646 --> 04:24.060
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember only you

04:24.479 --> 04:27.305
can prevent forest and range fires.

04:27.545 --> 04:36.342
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowling and a-growling and a-sniff in the air.

04:36.903 --> 04:40.991
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

04:41.352 --> 04:45.981
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:54.702 --> 05:02.552
Oh
