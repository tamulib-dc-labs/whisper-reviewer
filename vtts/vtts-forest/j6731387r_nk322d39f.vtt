00:08.114 --> 00:12.179
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:13.041 --> 00:14.242
Hello there, folks.

00:14.302 --> 00:17.386
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:17.867 --> 00:22.914
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:23.334 --> 00:28.321
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:28.862 --> 00:32.046
Today, it's that well-known actor, Dick Powell.

00:32.819 --> 00:36.284
Mr. Powell, what are you doing here in this forestry office?

00:36.304 --> 00:38.366
Just looking for some color for a new show, Smokey.

00:38.907 --> 00:39.949
But never mind about me.

00:40.710 --> 00:43.654
Look at this message that's just come in from one of the forest districts.

00:44.174 --> 00:44.635
I'll read it.

00:45.857 --> 00:52.245
The fire that started yesterday outside the forest boundary was caused by children playing with matches.

00:52.265 --> 00:58.233
We have 343 men on the fire, and the burned area now is 1,260 acres.

00:58.253 --> 01:02.539
The fire is threatening two communities, and eight homes already have been burned.

01:03.363 --> 01:07.548
Not much progress in controlling the fire because everything is very dry.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.932
We'll not know how much more land will burn until the day is over.

01:12.254 --> 01:14.176
End of message.

01:14.196 --> 01:17.680
Smokey, I understand many forest fires start this way.

01:17.700 --> 01:26.030
And it seems to me that every parent, every grown-up has a real responsibility to keep youngsters from playing with matches or fooling around with any fire.

01:26.050 --> 01:27.112
Yes, Mr. Powell.

01:27.592 --> 01:32.458
It takes only a small hand, unfortunately, to start a big fire.

01:33.282 --> 01:36.887
But now the Sons of the Pioneers have a special song for you.

01:36.907 --> 01:37.909
How about it, Lloyd?

01:38.330 --> 01:44.799
It's in the Zane Gray tradition, Dick, and it's called Move Along, You Lazy Cattle.

01:47.303 --> 01:51.489
Leave a long way to go, tell me why are you so slow?

01:51.930 --> 01:55.155
Move along, lazy cattle, move along.

01:55.709 --> 02:00.048
And you're not coming back, it's a shame but it's a fact.

02:00.289 --> 02:03.643
Move along, lazy cattle, move along.

02:04.197 --> 02:07.181
This is the last trail you travel over.

02:07.241 --> 02:09.384
Fill up on sage and clover.

02:09.424 --> 02:11.567
Move on, you prairie rover.

02:11.587 --> 02:12.368
Move on.

02:13.029 --> 02:18.077
And when you're all steak and stew together, I'll still be pounding leather.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.879
Move on, you cattle.

02:19.899 --> 02:21.842
Move along.

02:21.862 --> 02:26.568
There's a range far away where we'll all meet some sweet day.

02:26.588 --> 02:28.471
Move along, lazy cattle.

02:28.491 --> 02:29.833
Move along.

02:30.404 --> 02:34.750
For we're bound to meet again, so goodbye until then.

02:34.991 --> 02:38.175
Move along, lazy cattle, move along.

02:38.997 --> 02:41.941
This is the last trail you'll travel over.

02:42.021 --> 02:44.164
Fill up on sage and clover.

02:44.224 --> 02:46.368
Move on, you prairie rover.

02:46.408 --> 02:47.149
Move on.

02:47.850 --> 02:52.897
And when you're all steak and stew together, I'll still be found in leather.

02:52.937 --> 02:56.142
Move on, you cattle, move along.

02:56.611 --> 03:00.937
There's a range far away where we'll all meet some sweet day.

03:01.458 --> 03:04.422
Move along, lazy cattle, move along.

03:05.563 --> 03:09.689
For we're bound to meet again, so goodbye until then.

03:10.170 --> 03:13.174
Move along, lazy cattle, move along.

03:13.895 --> 03:16.839
This is the last trail you'll travel over.

03:16.899 --> 03:19.062
Fill up on sage and clover.

03:19.122 --> 03:21.245
Move on, you prairie rover.

03:21.305 --> 03:22.146
Move on.

03:22.531 --> 03:27.778
And when you're all steak and stew together, I'll still be pounding leather.

03:27.798 --> 03:29.481
Move on, you cattle.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.662
Move along.

03:31.624 --> 03:32.885
Move along.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.330
Move along.

03:36.350 --> 03:44.361
Move along.

03:44.381 --> 03:45.303
Thank you, boys.

03:45.944 --> 03:52.032
You know, it seems to me here's a real job for our junior forest rangers.

03:52.282 --> 03:57.228
to stop other boys and girls from playing with matches.

03:57.248 --> 03:58.890
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:59.371 --> 04:02.034
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:02.054 --> 04:07.661
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:07.701 --> 04:13.969
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:14.405 --> 04:28.606
Until we say hello there again, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:28.866 --> 04:33.072
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

04:33.338 --> 05:03.058
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

05:03.308 --> 05:03.685
Bye.
