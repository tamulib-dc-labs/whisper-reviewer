00:35.182 --> 00:43.079
Today, we present the third program in a new series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, Forest Ranger. A scene 
is a rocky ledge high above the little town of Fairview, just outside of Beaver Dam Forest. Ranger Bill Scott and his

00:50.274 --> 00:55.705
young assistant, Sam, are sitting on the big rock, taking it easy. They have just finished a sandwich lunch after a hard 
morning's work of exploring and mapping the land about them. Now as we join them, Sam reaches into his pocket, pulls out

01:01.993 --> 01:09.325
his harmonica, moistens his lips, and starts to play. Ranger Bill, puffing on his pipe, smiles at the music, and yet it's 
obvious his thoughts are elsewhere. He keeps looking off to the north, where a strange formation of dark clouds has

01:17.659 --> 01:22.907
begun to take shape. His smile suddenly gives way to a tightening of his lips as he expertly pounds out his pipe ashes upon 
the rock and crushes them with the heel of his boot. A slight frown creases his now serious face. But Sam, not noticing,

01:35.640 --> 01:38.247
plays on.

01:43.120 --> 01:43.821
There. Now that that's out of my system, I'm ready to go to work again, Ranger Bill. Well, I'm afraid we're through here 
for today, Sam. But I thought we were going to put the full day in on this survey for the Fairview Town Council. Well, it'd

01:55.886 --> 01:58.812
be foolish to get started again with that storm coming up. Say, I hadn't noticed it before. Could be a bad storm, too, huh, 
Ranger Bill? Maybe. Maybe. And it's a local one, unfortunately. And from what we've seen of this watershed area, a local

02:06.788 --> 02:12.015
storm won't help things much, will it? After the general rains we've had, too. You're right, Sam. All this watershed 
land above Fairview has been suffering some pretty rough treatment through the years. There's been too much timber cut

02:20.626 --> 02:22.248
off. The range areas have been overgrazed. And that big fire that whipped through here last year didn't help a bit 
either. Just like that Rockville area, isn't it, Ranger Bill? Golly, I'll never forget that flood last summer and the

02:31.446 --> 02:36.413
way we kept the water out of the sawmill. No, that's a bit different, Sam. The conditions are about the same, but there's 
no big man-made reservoir between this highland and Fairview, remember? The folks at Rockville had plenty of time to

02:46.467 --> 02:49.932
get out of town before the dam gave way. Yes, it's different here. But I don't understand, Ranger Bill. Well, look, Sam, 
the danger of a terrible flash flood building up here and rushing down on Fairview with hardly any warning is very great.

03:03.550 --> 03:09.321
You know, it doesn't take much when the soil is poor and protective covering of grass, bushes, and trees is almost gone. 
One heavy downpour of rain sometime and look out. But Fairview's had other floods in the past. That's why the town

03:16.299 --> 03:19.222
council plans to do something about it, isn't it? Mm-hmm. You told me that it has cost them plenty to repair the damage to 
roads and bridges and homes each time. That's really why we're here. Yes, Sam. Mayor Arnold and the Fairview town

03:28.994 --> 03:37.143
council made up their minds years ago to buy up all of this tax-delinquent, clear-cut, burned and eroded land here on the 
watershed. To plant it all up and make a community forest out of it. But as so often happens, they haven't done much more

03:41.347 --> 03:44.632
than that. I hoped our survey here would help, Sam, and yet I don't know. Wow, it's really going to rain, isn't it? See, I 
just felt the first drop. Let's get out of here, Ranger Bill. I want to radio Joe on Hawk Tower first. You know, Sam, it's a

03:57.770 --> 04:02.297
fine idea for a ranger to let somebody know where he is and what he's doing all the time. Yes, sir. It's a good thing we've 
got the radio hooked up inside the truck cab. Come on, let's get in before we get soaked. Okay. I'll turn the set on and let

04:12.329 --> 04:14.211
her warm up a bit. There we are. It's raining hotter and hotter every minute. Think we're in for a cloudburst, Ranger 
Bill? It looks that way, Sam. Well, I'm going to try Hawk Tower. SP-7 to Hawk Tower. SP-7 to Hawk Tower. Come in, Hawk

04:28.445 --> 04:29.186
Tower. Hawk Tower back to SP-7. Come in, Ranger Bill. Boy, his signal's fine. Hello, Joe. Looks like our work here is 
washed up for today. We'll be heading back to the Ranger Station. You have anything to report? Come in. That must be a bad

04:43.861 --> 04:46.504
storm where you and Sam are. I can see the heavy black clouds from the tower. It's clear and dry here. I have nothing to 
report. Oh, oh, no. No, wait. I almost forgot. June won't be with us for supper tonight. She called the tower and said

04:57.997 --> 05:03.343
she's going to Fairview to spend the night with her friend, Penny Perkins. Penny's folks are away. Did you get that? Come 
in. Did you see that lightning flash, Ranger Bill? Say, isn't it dangerous using the radio? Say, let's get out of here,

05:13.371 --> 05:14.472
huh? In a few minutes, Sam. Okay, Joe, I'll try to call you later. SB7, clear with Hawk Tower. Hawk Tower off. Oh, so June's 
headed for Fairview, is she? If we don't get started soon, Ranger Bill, we'll be floating down Devil's Run. There's

05:30.749 --> 05:32.851
water under our car wheels right now. We're on our way, Sam.

05:39.387 --> 05:41.050
Hey, where are you going? The road to the ranger station is off the other way. Well, I've changed my mind about going back 
to the station. But why? Well, boy, I just don't like the way things look, that's all. But you're heading right down along

05:50.124 --> 05:52.708
Devil's Run, Ranger Bill. That's right. There's an old logging road down the ravine, Sam. It might get us to Fairview 
faster than any other road we could take. What do you mean? It might get us there faster. Well, I haven't been over it in

06:01.621 --> 06:04.045
some time, Sam. There may be a tree across it or something. Worth a chance, though, with a storm building up every minute. 
Hmm, this road runs pretty close to the stream in places, doesn't it? See, that's funny. There was no stream on Devil's

06:16.316 --> 06:19.220
Run this morning. Rainwater has to go somewhere, Sam. With most of the forest covering gone, well, what's to hold it 
back? Golly, I see what you mean. I've got to speed this truck up a bit. Holy smoke, the water's building up too, Ranger

06:29.438 --> 06:32.523
Bill. What you're witnessing, Sam, is the beginning of a flash flood. And I'm afraid this is just the beginning. The 
water will really get high downstream. And Fairview is downstream. Yes, and the Perkins place, remember, is right on

06:42.620 --> 06:46.026
the edge of Devil's Run above the town. Say, June might be there. June and Penny Perkins too, Sam. Well, I just hope we get 
there in time. The

06:54.093 --> 07:03.665
truck speeds wildly down the rough logging road. Precious minutes pass by. Meantime, far downstream, the 
accumulation of runaway rainwater from all parts of the overcut, overgrazed and burned watershed fills up into a

07:05.848 --> 07:17.383
frightening flood, overflowing the banks of Devil's Run. It fills the basement and beats away at the bottom floor of the 
Perkins home. It throws huge rocks and uprooted trees against the bridge that ties the main highway to the town of

07:21.529 --> 07:27.280
Fairview. Here and there, water covers the narrow wood grove, but the ground beneath is hard and the truck moves on and on 
through the water.

07:42.794 --> 07:44.837
Finally, the way is easier. The road dips downward and just out of reach are the swollen waters of Devil's Run. Won't be 
long now, Sam. We're almost there. Golly, look at that high water, will you? Good thing we're above Devil's Run. Say,

07:58.217 --> 08:00.401
it's not raining very hard anymore. Yeah, but there's more water coming down out of the hills every minute, though. Oh. 
That's got me worried, Sam. I don't mind telling you. You mean you're worried about June and Penny? Perkins Place is just

08:09.094 --> 08:11.097
across Devil's Run. The water must be very high right there now. There's only one way to get across. That's the bridge, 
and I'm wondering... Holy smoke! Look, Ranger Bill. What? Up ahead. Oh, yes, I see. Two people right on the road near the

08:21.386 --> 08:23.489
edge of the rising water. They're waving at us to stop. It's June, Ranger Bill. One of them is June, but that's not Penny 
with her. It's a man. It's the mayor of Fairview. Yeah, Mayor Arnold. Right across the flood from them is the Perkins

08:32.984 --> 08:34.827
place. Golly, where is Penny? I'd better stop the car before I skid into them.

08:44.101 --> 08:44.822
Hi there, June. Hello, Mayor Arnold. Oh, Uncle Bill, I'm so glad you're here. Ranger, this is bad, mighty bad. Where's 
Penny, June? She's there, over there across Devil Drunk, in her house. Holy smoke, that place is almost underwater.

08:59.263 --> 09:01.185
We've got to get that girl out of there. Come on, let's drive down to the bridge and try getting across to her. Oh, the 
bridge washed out, Uncle Bill. I couldn't get across. That's right, Ranger. I met this young lady on this side of the

09:07.975 --> 09:11.019
bridge just before it collapsed. I see. I was checking on the flood. Well, sir, most of the folks are working right in 
town. I don't believe any of them realize Miss Perkins is trapped in her home, and we can't get word to them. Oh, Uncle

09:21.175 --> 09:23.037
Bill, what are we going to do? There now, June, we'll figure something out. Golly, if you only had your new horse, Sparks, 
here, Ranger Bill, he could swim you across, I bet. Yes, I think Sparks could do it at that. Sam, you've given me an idea.

09:35.227 --> 09:37.794
Ranger, if you can get that young lady out of there. Why, the whole town of Fairview will never forget it. No, sir. You've 
got my word as mayor for that. How about doing something about those hills back up there that caused this year after year?

09:48.023 --> 09:49.885
How about that community forest, Mayor? Anything, Ranger. I promise that I'll do anything for you. Sam, get that rope 
out of the truck and hurry. Yes, sir. Look, Uncle Bill, they're at Penny's house. That water's already up to the second

09:57.756 --> 10:00.880
floor, and it's still going up. That's not what I mean. Look, there's a white sheet of something being waved up and down 
from that bedroom window. Good. Penny must see us, then. Here's the rope, Ranger Bill. Will it be long enough? I think so.

10:12.836 --> 10:13.677
Now listen, all of you. I'm going to tie one end of this rope to my belt and try to get across to Penny. Now, you three will 
have to drag us back through the water if I make it. Now, tie the other end to a tree, Sam. I'm going to take off my shirt and

10:23.279 --> 10:25.682
these heavy boots. But, Uncle Bill, you can't swim across there. The current is too strong. I'm ready now. No, I know 
that, June. I'm going upstairs a ways and let the current work me to Penny's house as I swim. Good man, let me do it at that.

10:38.477 --> 10:39.698
Well, here goes. And keep a tight hold on that rope, do you hear? Good luck, Ranger. Yes, Uncle Bill, good luck. Oh, golly, 
he's going way upstream, isn't he? He's not underestimating the strength of the current, that's all. There he goes into

10:50.300 --> 10:51.502
the water. Boy, what a dive. Now he's swimming. Man, what powerful strokes. He doesn't seem to be making much headway, 
though. Don't say that, girl. He'll make it. I know he will. Oh, you bet he will. Look, he's headed right for the place. Oh,

11:03.682 --> 11:05.445
please, please, make it work, Uncle Bill. Please. He's done it. Hooray. He's done it. Look, he's right over the front 
porch now. There. Look, he's swimming toward the window where the white sheet is. Look, Penny's coming out of the

11:12.075 --> 11:13.598
window. Ranger Bill's tying the rope around her waist, too. He's waving at us. He wants us to start pulling. Come on, now. 
Get a good tight grip on it. All right, now. Pull. There. Pull. That's it. They're coming. We're doing it. Swirl. Pull. Be

11:26.839 --> 11:27.501
careful. Penny's underwater. No, no. The ranger's lifting her up as high as he can. Come on now. Just a little walk. Oh, 
hard. Come on. Oh, boy. Here they come. All right. Hold on. Don't pull anymore. They're standing up. Penny, she looks all

11:40.023 --> 11:41.565
in. No wonder. That was tough going. Say, Ranger Bill has lifted her up in his arm. He's carrying her into shore. Nice 
going, Ranger. Nice work. Uncle Bill, what's the matter with Penny? Her eyes, they're closed, and her face is so pale. I

11:57.247 --> 11:58.689
think she's fainted, that's all, June. Put her down now. There. Now keep your eye on her, June. Got to get her to a warm 
place as soon as we can. Sam, get the truck, will you? We'll drive to Tom Glover's ranch outside the flood area. Here's

12:11.941 --> 12:14.123
your shirt, Ranger Bill, and I'll be right back. Ranger Scott? Yes, Mayor Arnold? I meant what I said, Ranger. We're 
going to take over that watershed land. We're going to put in some emergency trenches, plant grass and trees. We're

12:24.775 --> 12:27.478
going to have a community forest here, believe me. We're going to tame the devil in Devil's Run, and we'll have you to 
thank for it. Well, that's fine, Mayor. Someday your children and their children will be thanking you for making

12:34.900 --> 12:41.406
Fairview a safer and happier and better place to live in. A community forest can do that, Mayor. Well, here comes Sam now. 
Look, Penny is opening her eyes. Are you all right, Penny? Oh, there, there, Penny. Don't say a word. Just lie quietly.

12:53.216 --> 12:53.776
You'll be fine. All right, Mayor. Give me a hand here. June, you ride in front with me and old Penny. Sam, hop on and back. 
Right, Ranger Bill? Well... We're all set. So long, Mayor. Goodbye, Ranger. And God bless you. And

13:11.658 --> 13:22.888
so, Fairview has finally learned its lesson. And Mayor Arnold has taken it to heart. You have just heard the third in a new 
series of programs on forest conservation with Bill Scott, Forest Rangers. Don't fail to hear next week's story when

13:34.604 --> 13:40.891
our friends ride the range in search of a terrible killer on the loose. Ranger Bill's fine horse, Sparks, has a part in the 
adventure. Until then, adios, so long for a while. Bill Scott, forest ranger, comes to you with the cooperation of the

13:50.803 --> 13:56.109
Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Bill Scott is written by Bill Burgothen and produced for radio by Van 
Rensselaer Brokaw. Your narrator has been Al Reilly. The
