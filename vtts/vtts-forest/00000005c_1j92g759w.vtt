00:35.182 --> 00:43.079
Today, we present the third program in a new series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

00:43.980 --> 00:49.592
A scene is a rocky ledge high above the little town of Fairview, just outside of Beaver Dam Forest.

00:50.274 --> 00:55.705
Ranger Bill Scott and his young assistant, Sam, are sitting on the big rock, taking it easy.

00:55.803 --> 01:01.973
They have just finished a sandwich lunch after a hard morning's work of exploring and mapping the land about them.

01:01.993 --> 01:09.325
Now as we join them, Sam reaches into his pocket, pulls out his harmonica, moistens his lips, and starts to play.

01:11.028 --> 01:17.638
Ranger Bill, puffing on his pipe, smiles at the music, and yet it's obvious his thoughts are elsewhere.

01:17.659 --> 01:22.907
He keeps looking off to the north, where a strange formation of dark clouds has begun to take shape.

01:23.849 --> 01:31.329
His smile suddenly gives way to a tightening of his lips as he expertly pounds out his pipe ashes upon the rock and crushes them with the heel of his boot.

01:32.131 --> 01:34.978
A slight frown creases his now serious face.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.247
But Sam, not noticing, plays on.

01:43.120 --> 01:43.821
There.

01:44.342 --> 01:47.850
Now that that's out of my system, I'm ready to go to work again, Ranger Bill.

01:47.870 --> 01:49.793
Well, I'm afraid we're through here for today, Sam.

01:50.094 --> 01:55.505
But I thought we were going to put the full day in on this survey for the Fairview Town Council.

01:55.886 --> 01:58.812
Well, it'd be foolish to get started again with that storm coming up.

01:59.193 --> 02:01.297
Say, I hadn't noticed it before.

02:01.798 --> 02:03.762
Could be a bad storm, too, huh, Ranger Bill?

02:04.062 --> 02:04.263
Maybe.

02:04.283 --> 02:04.403
Maybe.

02:04.906 --> 02:06.768
And it's a local one, unfortunately.

02:06.788 --> 02:12.015
And from what we've seen of this watershed area, a local storm won't help things much, will it?

02:12.035 --> 02:13.737
After the general rains we've had, too.

02:13.838 --> 02:15.460
You're right, Sam.

02:15.480 --> 02:20.166
All this watershed land above Fairview has been suffering some pretty rough treatment through the years.

02:20.626 --> 02:22.248
There's been too much timber cut off.

02:22.289 --> 02:24.231
The range areas have been overgrazed.

02:24.937 --> 02:28.322
And that big fire that whipped through here last year didn't help a bit either.

02:28.342 --> 02:30.945
Just like that Rockville area, isn't it, Ranger Bill?

02:31.446 --> 02:36.413
Golly, I'll never forget that flood last summer and the way we kept the water out of the sawmill.

02:36.693 --> 02:38.115
No, that's a bit different, Sam.

02:38.776 --> 02:45.626
The conditions are about the same, but there's no big man-made reservoir between this highland and Fairview, remember?

02:46.467 --> 02:49.932
The folks at Rockville had plenty of time to get out of town before the dam gave way.

02:50.907 --> 02:52.350
Yes, it's different here.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.734
But I don't understand, Ranger Bill.

02:54.934 --> 03:02.448
Well, look, Sam, the danger of a terrible flash flood building up here and rushing down on Fairview with hardly any warning is very great.

03:03.550 --> 03:09.321
You know, it doesn't take much when the soil is poor and protective covering of grass, bushes, and trees is almost gone.

03:10.432 --> 03:13.816
One heavy downpour of rain sometime and look out.

03:13.836 --> 03:16.279
But Fairview's had other floods in the past.

03:16.299 --> 03:19.222
That's why the town council plans to do something about it, isn't it?

03:19.743 --> 03:19.883
Mm-hmm.

03:19.903 --> 03:25.530
You told me that it has cost them plenty to repair the damage to roads and bridges and homes each time.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.332
That's really why we're here.

03:27.732 --> 03:28.273
Yes, Sam.

03:28.994 --> 03:37.143
Mayor Arnold and the Fairview town council made up their minds years ago to buy up all of this tax-delinquent, clear-cut, burned and eroded land here on the watershed.

03:37.844 --> 03:40.287
To plant it all up and make a community forest out of it.

03:41.347 --> 03:44.632
But as so often happens, they haven't done much more than that.

03:45.773 --> 03:48.938
I hoped our survey here would help, Sam, and yet I don't know.

03:48.958 --> 03:51.041
Wow, it's really going to rain, isn't it?

03:51.522 --> 03:53.745
See, I just felt the first drop.

03:53.765 --> 03:55.067
Let's get out of here, Ranger Bill.

03:55.227 --> 03:57.130
I want to radio Joe on Hawk Tower first.

03:57.770 --> 04:02.297
You know, Sam, it's a fine idea for a ranger to let somebody know where he is and what he's doing all the time.

04:02.397 --> 04:04.300
Yes, sir.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.064
It's a good thing we've got the radio hooked up inside the truck cab.

04:07.765 --> 04:09.728
Come on, let's get in before we get soaked.

04:09.848 --> 04:10.729
Okay.

04:12.329 --> 04:14.211
I'll turn the set on and let her warm up a bit.

04:15.632 --> 04:16.013
There we are.

04:16.293 --> 04:18.455
It's raining hotter and hotter every minute.

04:18.855 --> 04:20.737
Think we're in for a cloudburst, Ranger Bill?

04:20.898 --> 04:21.838
It looks that way, Sam.

04:22.739 --> 04:24.041
Well, I'm going to try Hawk Tower.

04:25.122 --> 04:26.323
SP-7 to Hawk Tower.

04:27.244 --> 04:28.405
SP-7 to Hawk Tower.

04:28.445 --> 04:29.186
Come in, Hawk Tower.

04:30.027 --> 04:31.568
Hawk Tower back to SP-7.

04:31.969 --> 04:32.809
Come in, Ranger Bill.

04:33.050 --> 04:35.052
Boy, his signal's fine.

04:35.072 --> 04:35.652
Hello, Joe.

04:36.593 --> 04:38.335
Looks like our work here is washed up for today.

04:38.915 --> 04:40.497
We'll be heading back to the Ranger Station.

04:40.898 --> 04:42.019
You have anything to report?

04:42.560 --> 04:43.841
Come in.

04:43.861 --> 04:46.504
That must be a bad storm where you and Sam are.

04:46.524 --> 04:49.147
I can see the heavy black clouds from the tower.

04:49.167 --> 04:50.389
It's clear and dry here.

04:50.869 --> 04:51.930
I have nothing to report.

04:52.411 --> 04:53.132
Oh, oh, no.

04:53.152 --> 04:54.213
No, wait.

04:54.233 --> 04:55.575
I almost forgot.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.557
June won't be with us for supper tonight.

04:57.997 --> 05:03.343
She called the tower and said she's going to Fairview to spend the night with her friend, Penny Perkins.

05:03.704 --> 05:04.765
Penny's folks are away.

05:05.105 --> 05:05.726
Did you get that?

05:06.006 --> 05:06.687
Come in.

05:07.325 --> 05:10.108
Did you see that lightning flash, Ranger Bill?

05:10.608 --> 05:13.011
Say, isn't it dangerous using the radio?

05:13.371 --> 05:14.472
Say, let's get out of here, huh?

05:14.492 --> 05:15.233
In a few minutes, Sam.

05:16.074 --> 05:18.016
Okay, Joe, I'll try to call you later.

05:18.576 --> 05:20.118
SB7, clear with Hawk Tower.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.540
Hawk Tower off.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.043
Oh, so June's headed for Fairview, is she?

05:26.124 --> 05:30.448
If we don't get started soon, Ranger Bill, we'll be floating down Devil's Run.

05:30.749 --> 05:32.851
There's water under our car wheels right now.

05:32.951 --> 05:34.092
We're on our way, Sam.

05:39.387 --> 05:41.050
Hey, where are you going?

05:41.610 --> 05:44.034
The road to the ranger station is off the other way.

05:44.054 --> 05:46.218
Well, I've changed my mind about going back to the station.

05:46.238 --> 05:46.758
But why?

05:47.119 --> 05:50.104
Well, boy, I just don't like the way things look, that's all.

05:50.124 --> 05:52.708
But you're heading right down along Devil's Run, Ranger Bill.

05:52.848 --> 05:53.268
That's right.

05:53.769 --> 05:55.672
There's an old logging road down the ravine, Sam.

05:56.193 --> 05:58.857
It might get us to Fairview faster than any other road we could take.

05:59.137 --> 05:59.638
What do you mean?

05:59.678 --> 06:01.361
It might get us there faster.

06:01.621 --> 06:04.045
Well, I haven't been over it in some time, Sam.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.039
There may be a tree across it or something.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.664
Worth a chance, though, with a storm building up every minute.

06:09.204 --> 06:14.393
Hmm, this road runs pretty close to the stream in places, doesn't it?

06:14.413 --> 06:15.755
See, that's funny.

06:16.316 --> 06:19.220
There was no stream on Devil's Run this morning.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.644
Rainwater has to go somewhere, Sam.

06:21.664 --> 06:24.949
With most of the forest covering gone, well, what's to hold it back?

06:24.969 --> 06:27.173
Golly, I see what you mean.

06:27.193 --> 06:28.615
I've got to speed this truck up a bit.

06:29.438 --> 06:32.523
Holy smoke, the water's building up too, Ranger Bill.

06:33.064 --> 06:36.530
What you're witnessing, Sam, is the beginning of a flash flood.

06:36.550 --> 06:38.193
And I'm afraid this is just the beginning.

06:39.114 --> 06:40.997
The water will really get high downstream.

06:41.017 --> 06:42.580
And Fairview is downstream.

06:42.620 --> 06:46.026
Yes, and the Perkins place, remember, is right on the edge of Devil's Run above the town.

06:46.426 --> 06:48.089
Say, June might be there.

06:48.290 --> 06:49.912
June and Penny Perkins too, Sam.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.797
Well, I just hope we get there in time.

06:54.093 --> 07:03.665
The truck speeds wildly down the rough logging road.

07:04.026 --> 07:05.307
Precious minutes pass by.

07:05.848 --> 07:17.383
Meantime, far downstream, the accumulation of runaway rainwater from all parts of the overcut, overgrazed and burned watershed fills up into a frightening flood, overflowing the banks of Devil's Run.

07:17.482 --> 07:21.509
It fills the basement and beats away at the bottom floor of the Perkins home.

07:21.529 --> 07:27.280
It throws huge rocks and uprooted trees against the bridge that ties the main highway to the town of Fairview.

07:27.300 --> 07:34.613
Here and there, water covers the narrow wood grove, but the ground beneath is hard and the truck moves on and on through the water.

07:42.794 --> 07:44.837
Finally, the way is easier.

07:44.857 --> 07:49.144
The road dips downward and just out of reach are the swollen waters of Devil's Run.

07:50.546 --> 07:52.288
Won't be long now, Sam.

07:52.308 --> 07:53.010
We're almost there.

07:53.210 --> 07:55.393
Golly, look at that high water, will you?

07:55.834 --> 07:57.496
Good thing we're above Devil's Run.

07:58.217 --> 08:00.401
Say, it's not raining very hard anymore.

08:00.541 --> 08:03.265
Yeah, but there's more water coming down out of the hills every minute, though.

08:03.586 --> 08:04.227
Oh.

08:04.247 --> 08:05.368
That's got me worried, Sam.

08:05.408 --> 08:06.410
I don't mind telling you.

08:06.430 --> 08:08.613
You mean you're worried about June and Penny?

08:09.094 --> 08:11.097
Perkins Place is just across Devil's Run.

08:11.431 --> 08:13.614
The water must be very high right there now.

08:13.634 --> 08:15.037
There's only one way to get across.

08:15.718 --> 08:17.781
That's the bridge, and I'm wondering... Holy smoke!

08:17.881 --> 08:18.722
Look, Ranger Bill.

08:18.802 --> 08:18.983
What?

08:19.063 --> 08:19.543
Up ahead.

08:19.984 --> 08:21.366
Oh, yes, I see.

08:21.386 --> 08:23.489
Two people right on the road near the edge of the rising water.

08:23.509 --> 08:24.531
They're waving at us to stop.

08:24.611 --> 08:26.013
It's June, Ranger Bill.

08:26.033 --> 08:28.557
One of them is June, but that's not Penny with her.

08:28.577 --> 08:29.639
It's a man.

08:29.999 --> 08:31.742
It's the mayor of Fairview.

08:31.762 --> 08:32.964
Yeah, Mayor Arnold.

08:32.984 --> 08:34.827
Right across the flood from them is the Perkins place.

08:34.987 --> 08:36.650
Golly, where is Penny?

08:37.030 --> 08:38.873
I'd better stop the car before I skid into them.

08:44.101 --> 08:44.822
Hi there, June.

08:45.343 --> 08:46.284
Hello, Mayor Arnold.

08:46.304 --> 08:48.948
Oh, Uncle Bill, I'm so glad you're here.

08:49.188 --> 08:51.291
Ranger, this is bad, mighty bad.

08:51.612 --> 08:52.313
Where's Penny, June?

08:52.633 --> 08:56.419
She's there, over there across Devil Drunk, in her house.

08:56.539 --> 08:59.102
Holy smoke, that place is almost underwater.

08:59.263 --> 09:01.185
We've got to get that girl out of there.

09:01.205 --> 09:03.409
Come on, let's drive down to the bridge and try getting across to her.

09:03.569 --> 09:05.271
Oh, the bridge washed out, Uncle Bill.

09:05.792 --> 09:06.894
I couldn't get across.

09:06.974 --> 09:07.735
That's right, Ranger.

09:07.975 --> 09:11.019
I met this young lady on this side of the bridge just before it collapsed.

09:11.140 --> 09:11.460
I see.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.842
I was checking on the flood.

09:13.143 --> 09:16.027
Well, sir, most of the folks are working right in town.

09:16.368 --> 09:21.155
I don't believe any of them realize Miss Perkins is trapped in her home, and we can't get word to them.

09:21.175 --> 09:23.037
Oh, Uncle Bill, what are we going to do?

09:23.138 --> 09:25.100
There now, June, we'll figure something out.

09:25.120 --> 09:30.829
Golly, if you only had your new horse, Sparks, here, Ranger Bill, he could swim you across, I bet.

09:30.849 --> 09:32.451
Yes, I think Sparks could do it at that.

09:33.562 --> 09:35.207
Sam, you've given me an idea.

09:35.227 --> 09:37.794
Ranger, if you can get that young lady out of there.

09:37.814 --> 09:40.442
Why, the whole town of Fairview will never forget it.

09:40.462 --> 09:41.324
No, sir.

09:41.344 --> 09:43.310
You've got my word as mayor for that.

09:43.570 --> 09:47.301
How about doing something about those hills back up there that caused this year after year?

09:48.023 --> 09:49.885
How about that community forest, Mayor?

09:50.206 --> 09:51.027
Anything, Ranger.

09:51.227 --> 09:52.930
I promise that I'll do anything for you.

09:53.110 --> 09:54.572
Sam, get that rope out of the truck and hurry.

09:54.692 --> 09:55.052
Yes, sir.

09:55.393 --> 09:57.736
Look, Uncle Bill, they're at Penny's house.

09:57.756 --> 10:00.880
That water's already up to the second floor, and it's still going up.

10:01.020 --> 10:02.162
That's not what I mean.

10:02.182 --> 10:06.628
Look, there's a white sheet of something being waved up and down from that bedroom window.

10:06.648 --> 10:07.429
Good.

10:07.449 --> 10:08.270
Penny must see us, then.

10:08.971 --> 10:10.092
Here's the rope, Ranger Bill.

10:10.373 --> 10:11.114
Will it be long enough?

10:11.614 --> 10:12.035
I think so.

10:12.836 --> 10:13.677
Now listen, all of you.

10:14.028 --> 10:17.712
I'm going to tie one end of this rope to my belt and try to get across to Penny.

10:17.732 --> 10:20.395
Now, you three will have to drag us back through the water if I make it.

10:21.116 --> 10:23.259
Now, tie the other end to a tree, Sam.

10:23.279 --> 10:25.682
I'm going to take off my shirt and these heavy boots.

10:25.702 --> 10:28.445
But, Uncle Bill, you can't swim across there.

10:28.465 --> 10:29.887
The current is too strong.

10:29.947 --> 10:30.828
I'm ready now.

10:31.488 --> 10:32.770
No, I know that, June.

10:32.790 --> 10:36.114
I'm going upstairs a ways and let the current work me to Penny's house as I swim.

10:36.254 --> 10:38.196
Good man, let me do it at that.

10:38.477 --> 10:39.698
Well, here goes.

10:40.218 --> 10:42.142
And keep a tight hold on that rope, do you hear?

10:42.463 --> 10:43.325
Good luck, Ranger.

10:43.365 --> 10:45.389
Yes, Uncle Bill, good luck.

10:45.409 --> 10:47.794
Oh, golly, he's going way upstream, isn't he?

10:47.814 --> 10:50.280
He's not underestimating the strength of the current, that's all.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.502
There he goes into the water.

10:51.743 --> 10:53.046
Boy, what a dive.

10:53.166 --> 10:54.168
Now he's swimming.

10:54.188 --> 10:55.511
Man, what powerful strokes.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.315
He doesn't seem to be making much headway, though.

10:58.814 --> 10:59.956
Don't say that, girl.

10:59.996 --> 11:00.517
He'll make it.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.158
I know he will.

11:01.178 --> 11:02.059
Oh, you bet he will.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.662
Look, he's headed right for the place.

11:03.682 --> 11:05.445
Oh, please, please, make it work, Uncle Bill.

11:05.565 --> 11:05.825
Please.

11:05.845 --> 11:06.266
He's done it.

11:06.486 --> 11:07.047
Hooray.

11:07.067 --> 11:07.648
He's done it.

11:07.688 --> 11:09.411
Look, he's right over the front porch now.

11:09.511 --> 11:09.731
There.

11:09.992 --> 11:12.055
Look, he's swimming toward the window where the white sheet is.

11:12.075 --> 11:13.598
Look, Penny's coming out of the window.

11:13.858 --> 11:16.001
Ranger Bill's tying the rope around her waist, too.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.163
He's waving at us.

11:17.263 --> 11:18.345
He wants us to start pulling.

11:18.505 --> 11:18.886
Come on, now.

11:18.926 --> 11:20.388
Get a good tight grip on it.

11:20.408 --> 11:20.909
All right, now.

11:21.170 --> 11:21.570
Pull.

11:21.751 --> 11:22.031
There.

11:22.612 --> 11:22.712
Pull.

11:23.030 --> 11:23.652
That's it.

11:23.672 --> 11:24.373
They're coming.

11:24.413 --> 11:25.035
We're doing it.

11:25.055 --> 11:25.656
Swirl.

11:25.677 --> 11:26.057
Pull.

11:26.839 --> 11:27.501
Be careful.

11:27.681 --> 11:28.704
Penny's underwater.

11:28.724 --> 11:29.265
No, no.

11:29.305 --> 11:31.250
The ranger's lifting her up as high as he can.

11:31.350 --> 11:31.792
Come on now.

11:31.852 --> 11:33.075
Just a little walk.

11:33.095 --> 11:33.776
Oh, hard.

11:33.796 --> 11:34.137
Come on.

11:34.458 --> 11:34.919
Oh, boy.

11:35.160 --> 11:35.741
Here they come.

11:36.122 --> 11:36.423
All right.

11:36.724 --> 11:37.125
Hold on.

11:37.165 --> 11:38.007
Don't pull anymore.

11:38.027 --> 11:38.929
They're standing up.

11:40.023 --> 11:41.565
Penny, she looks all in.

11:41.685 --> 11:42.246
No wonder.

11:42.306 --> 11:43.268
That was tough going.

11:43.688 --> 11:45.711
Say, Ranger Bill has lifted her up in his arm.

11:46.051 --> 11:47.794
He's carrying her into shore.

11:47.814 --> 11:48.935
Nice going, Ranger.

11:49.076 --> 11:49.977
Nice work.

11:50.718 --> 11:52.380
Uncle Bill, what's the matter with Penny?

11:52.821 --> 11:56.286
Her eyes, they're closed, and her face is so pale.

11:57.247 --> 11:58.689
I think she's fainted, that's all, June.

11:59.771 --> 12:00.391
Put her down now.

12:01.833 --> 12:02.915
There.

12:02.935 --> 12:03.916
Now keep your eye on her, June.

12:04.617 --> 12:06.400
Got to get her to a warm place as soon as we can.

12:07.361 --> 12:08.663
Sam, get the truck, will you?

12:09.318 --> 12:11.821
We'll drive to Tom Glover's ranch outside the flood area.

12:11.941 --> 12:14.123
Here's your shirt, Ranger Bill, and I'll be right back.

12:14.704 --> 12:15.345
Ranger Scott?

12:15.925 --> 12:16.646
Yes, Mayor Arnold?

12:17.087 --> 12:18.208
I meant what I said, Ranger.

12:18.608 --> 12:20.771
We're going to take over that watershed land.

12:20.791 --> 12:24.334
We're going to put in some emergency trenches, plant grass and trees.

12:24.775 --> 12:27.478
We're going to have a community forest here, believe me.

12:28.059 --> 12:33.084
We're going to tame the devil in Devil's Run, and we'll have you to thank for it.

12:33.104 --> 12:33.925
Well, that's fine, Mayor.

12:34.900 --> 12:41.406
Someday your children and their children will be thanking you for making Fairview a safer and happier and better place to live in.

12:41.426 --> 12:44.108
A community forest can do that, Mayor.

12:44.128 --> 12:45.189
Well, here comes Sam now.

12:45.209 --> 12:48.071
Look, Penny is opening her eyes.

12:48.091 --> 12:49.493
Are you all right, Penny?

12:49.633 --> 12:50.573
Oh, there, there, Penny.

12:51.394 --> 12:52.095
Don't say a word.

12:52.115 --> 12:53.196
Just lie quietly.

12:53.216 --> 12:53.776
You'll be fine.

12:55.498 --> 12:56.038
All right, Mayor.

12:56.519 --> 12:57.179
Give me a hand here.

12:58.340 --> 13:00.482
June, you ride in front with me and old Penny.

13:01.183 --> 13:02.163
Sam, hop on and back.

13:02.224 --> 13:03.004
Right, Ranger Bill?

13:03.585 --> 13:03.945
Well...

13:04.432 --> 13:05.133
We're all set.

13:06.214 --> 13:06.854
So long, Mayor.

13:07.475 --> 13:08.335
Goodbye, Ranger.

13:09.296 --> 13:11.598
And God bless you.

13:11.658 --> 13:22.888
And so, Fairview has finally learned its lesson.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.772
And Mayor Arnold has taken it to heart.

13:26.792 --> 13:33.578
You have just heard the third in a new series of programs on forest conservation with Bill Scott, Forest Rangers.

13:34.604 --> 13:40.891
Don't fail to hear next week's story when our friends ride the range in search of a terrible killer on the loose.

13:41.912 --> 13:45.056
Ranger Bill's fine horse, Sparks, has a part in the adventure.

13:46.177 --> 13:49.701
Until then, adios, so long for a while.

13:50.803 --> 13:56.109
Bill Scott, forest ranger, comes to you with the cooperation of the Forest Service, U.S.

13:56.129 --> 13:57.210
Department of Agriculture.

13:57.891 --> 14:03.497
Bill Scott is written by Bill Burgothen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokaw.

14:03.815 --> 14:06.379
Your narrator has been Al Reilly.

14:06.979 --> 14:33.096
The End
