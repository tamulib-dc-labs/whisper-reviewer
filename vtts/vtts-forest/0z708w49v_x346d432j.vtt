00:18.037 --> 00:29.649
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:30.010 --> 00:33.533
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

00:34.134 --> 00:38.118
Hi there, friends, I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodman.

00:38.138 --> 00:40.401
Glad you could come up this way on up the trail.

00:40.521 --> 00:45.506
So how about having a seat beside me here on this log, right under the old pine tree.

00:45.526 --> 00:47.368
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:48.175 --> 00:50.839
That's because we've kept fire from running wild through here.

00:52.140 --> 00:57.467
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:57.488 --> 01:02.915
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there, the Sons of the Pioneers.

01:02.935 --> 01:05.138
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail, too.

01:05.238 --> 01:10.645
And now that you're here and comfortably settled, they're going to start off this little outdoor get-together of ours.

01:10.665 --> 01:14.250
So just relax and let's hear some mighty fine singing, huh?

01:21.470 --> 01:49.975
In Sierra Nevada Close to heaven That's where I want to be Clouds drift by In Sierra Nevada

01:50.900 --> 01:58.952
Where my new love is there waiting for me?

02:02.695 --> 02:13.611
Will I find my love waiting with teardrops in her eyes for a lover who's been too long away?

02:14.392 --> 02:26.830
Or will this trail I'm riding bring an end to all her size for this time I'm coming back to stay way up high?

02:28.565 --> 02:56.985
In Sierra Nevada Clouds drift by By my true love and me Will I find my love waiting With teardrops in her eyes For a lover who's been too long away

02:58.703 --> 03:28.187
Trail that I'm riding Bringing in to all her size For this time I'm coming back to stay Way up high In Sierra Nevada Clouds drift by By my true love and me

03:33.162 --> 03:37.306
Sierra Nevada, that's the big mountain country.

03:38.167 --> 03:44.074
Lots of folks find the kind of outdoor recreation they want among the towering peaks and the glacier runs.

03:45.035 --> 03:48.518
Others in the birch and spruce and hemlock of the late states.

03:49.119 --> 03:54.425
And New England, where the cold, clear lakes and fast-running streams give up bass and trout.

03:55.406 --> 04:01.212
Yes, sir, all over this great country of ours, more and more folks are getting outdoors all the time.

04:01.613 --> 04:05.736
For the Sunday picnic or to camp or to hike along woodland trails.

04:06.477 --> 04:09.039
And in the winter to do a bit of snowshoeing or skiing.

04:10.120 --> 04:17.887
Now who can measure the value of our parts for the inspiration they give all of us and the recreation they provide?

04:17.907 --> 04:20.649
Isn't it fine when we're out doing these things I'm talking about?

04:21.830 --> 04:24.432
It's when you want to get outdoors and can't.

04:24.452 --> 04:26.194
Well, sir, that's hard to take sometimes.

04:26.994 --> 04:28.776
The sons of the pioneers have been through this.

04:29.476 --> 04:31.418
They call it the faraway blues.

04:34.553 --> 04:34.873
.

04:34.893 --> 04:35.094
.

04:35.114 --> 04:58.840
.

05:01.199 --> 05:01.539
.

05:01.559 --> 05:02.260
.

05:02.280 --> 05:30.126
.

05:45.007 --> 06:13.613
Yes, sir, it's an awful feeling when you want to get outdoors and camp.

06:14.538 --> 06:16.601
Now, what do you like best?

06:16.621 --> 06:20.047
Roasting a nice, thick, juicy steak over an open pass?

06:21.109 --> 06:25.376
Spreading your sleeping bag down on a soft spot under the trees?

06:25.396 --> 06:29.262
Or is it enough for you just to ride along tree-shaded forest roads?

06:30.384 --> 06:32.868
There's no end to the pleasure you can find outdoors.

06:33.910 --> 06:37.656
East to his own taste and his own favorite spot.

06:37.676 --> 06:41.102
Now, a fellow I know says Wyoming is where his heart is.

06:42.365 --> 07:03.597
There's a home in Wyoming Far across the great divide Skies are brighter Hearts are lighter And the trail is open wide There's a girl in Wyoming

07:04.100 --> 07:15.780
Wyoming, neath the prairie stars that shine, let me wander way out yonder.

07:16.250 --> 07:44.670
to that old sweetheart of mine through the purple sage once more we'll ride ride ride down the sunset trail together side by side all alone in Wyoming

07:44.954 --> 08:14.050
We will plan a nest or two Just a home in old Wyoming In the land where dreams come true And I'll bet when that fellow finally gets to go to Wyoming, all along the way he'll find little spots along the highway and in the forest and woods to eat his lunch or put up a tent for the night.

08:14.873 --> 08:17.836
That's where the state and federal forest and park men come in.

08:18.657 --> 08:23.282
They help provide some mighty fine recreation areas for your use and mine.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.105
And they ask so little in return.

08:27.146 --> 08:30.870
Only that we help keep these places as clean as we like to find them.

08:31.711 --> 08:35.395
To treat them kind of like our home away from home.

08:35.415 --> 08:42.923
You know, when you toss down trash and cans and bottles, you make it mighty tough on the men who have to clean up after you.

08:43.595 --> 08:52.628
They could be doing much more worthwhile things, maintaining the trails or improving the forest generally for even more effective use.

08:52.648 --> 08:53.289
Things like that.

08:54.371 --> 09:01.822
Yes, sir, it's up to you and me not to be either a firebug through carelessness or a litterbug through thoughtlessness.

09:03.123 --> 09:07.069
I think those are the sentiments of the sons of the pioneers, too.

09:07.089 --> 09:07.950
Am I right, Lloyd?

09:08.271 --> 09:11.796
Well, Billy, when the boys and I are out on the trail, we play a little games.

09:12.181 --> 09:24.444
The first one of us that gets caught tossing down a candy wrapper, paper sack, tobacco can, or anything out here in the woods, he gets to do the cooking for two days straight and the cleaning up after meals.

09:25.065 --> 09:31.337
Then the rest of us can take it easy around the campfire and sing the kind of song that just fits the outdoors.

09:35.468 --> 09:40.052
An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day.

09:41.794 --> 09:45.697
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way.

09:47.960 --> 09:54.446
When, oh, at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw a plowin' through the ragged sky.

09:56.407 --> 10:00.832
And up the cloudy drawl.

10:04.034 --> 10:04.615
I-A-B-I

10:08.965 --> 10:14.412
Rose heard in the sky.

10:17.036 --> 10:22.103
Their friends were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel.

10:23.244 --> 10:28.191
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel.

10:29.453 --> 10:33.158
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky.

10:33.498 --> 10:36.222
For he saw the riders coming high.

10:37.450 --> 11:03.660
And he heard their mournful cries I-A-I-O Ghost riders in the sky As the riders loped on by him He heard one call his name

11:04.282 --> 11:23.231
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our race, then, cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride a-trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies.

11:23.692 --> 11:23.792
I am.

11:31.298 --> 11:41.753
Riders in the sky.

11:54.671 --> 11:55.793
Riders in the sky.

11:57.295 --> 12:01.120
Well, I know one fellow who always keeps his feet solidly on the ground.

12:01.673 --> 12:03.876
and has a way of asking us to do the same.

12:04.557 --> 12:11.225
He's Smokey Bear, coming up the trail right now, big as life and with a special message for it.

12:11.245 --> 12:12.526
Hello there, folks.

12:13.427 --> 12:16.331
Are you going picnicking or camping this weekend?

12:16.952 --> 12:22.779
Well, have a good time, but be extra careful with fire.

12:22.799 --> 12:31.309
There's nothing that can destroy a pretty picnic area or campground faster than fire turned loose by some careless,

12:31.745 --> 12:33.927
or unthinking person.

12:33.947 --> 12:43.057
So whenever you're outdoors, whether it's on a picnic, camping, or just driving through the country, be careful.

12:43.858 --> 12:48.923
Be careful with your matches and smokes and your campfire.

12:50.045 --> 12:52.808
Well, I'll be seen here.

12:54.049 --> 12:56.051
And there he goes on down the trail.

12:56.772 --> 12:57.853
Thank you, Smokey.

12:59.470 --> 13:03.054
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:04.135 --> 13:06.878
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:07.619 --> 13:17.010
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service and the station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:17.751 --> 13:22.196
So until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:22.896 --> 13:27.942
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:29.052 --> 13:30.433
Well, so long for now.

13:30.573 --> 13:40.302
From Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and from those wonderful fellows who sing your favorite songs of the outdoors the way you like to hear them, the sons of the pioneers.

13:40.322 --> 13:48.449
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowling and a-browling and a-sniffing the air.

13:49.030 --> 13:52.853
He can find a fire before he starts to flame.

13:53.233 --> 13:57.237
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

13:57.773 --> 14:05.943
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, growlin' and a-growlin' and a-slippin' the air.

14:06.623 --> 14:10.308
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:10.668 --> 14:14.713
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:15.273 --> 14:19.258
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:19.475 --> 14:36.910
Growlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear

14:36.890 --> 14:40.899
Prowlin' and the growlin' and the sniffin' the air.

14:41.601 --> 14:45.249
He can find a fire before it starts to slain.

14:45.690 --> 14:49.819
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.
