00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
[Silence.]

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
Timber!

00:18.000 --> 00:29.967
[Music.]

00:29.967 --> 00:32.198
Bill Scott, Forest Ranger!

00:32.198 --> 00:38.894
[Music.]

00:38.894 --> 00:47.086
Today, we present the final program in this second series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

00:47.106 --> 00:48.888
Our scene is Beaver Dam Forest.

00:49.469 --> 00:54.116
It is a late summer day and the sun is about to set in golden glory.

00:54.136 --> 00:58.923
Outwardly, the forest and all of its living plants and creatures seem at peace with the world.

00:59.624 --> 01:07.315
And yet, on the narrow woods road that runs along Storm Creek, small pebbles and bits of soil have been rolling down from above all day.

01:07.632 --> 01:10.155
a danger signal of more serious things to come.

01:10.936 --> 01:25.276
But Ranger Bill's niece, June, his two young assistants, Joe and Sam, have no knowledge of what's taking place above Storm Creek as they travel along the forest highway in the pickup truck.

01:25.296 --> 01:34.348
Even though this is the last day the three will spend on Beaver Dam Forest this summer, they seem unusually gay in spirit, excited, and downright frisky.

01:35.459 --> 01:39.104
Boy, won't Ranger Bill be surprised?

01:39.124 --> 01:41.467
I just want to see his face, that's all.

01:41.487 --> 01:42.568
A surprise party.

01:42.909 --> 01:44.350
Uncle Bill will be pleased.

01:44.631 --> 01:45.191
Oh, sure.

01:45.252 --> 01:46.433
Ranger Bill deserves it.

01:46.673 --> 01:51.199
He's always doing something for other people, and it's about time someone did something for him.

01:51.319 --> 01:54.063
I don't think Uncle Bill will ever think about that at all.

01:54.083 --> 01:54.604
Jesus.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.087
Hasn't everybody been wonderful?

01:57.247 --> 01:57.988
You bet, June.

01:58.408 --> 02:00.471
Just look at the stuff back there in the truck.

02:00.839 --> 02:05.405
Homemade bread, lemon pie, and homemade root beer from the McDonald's.

02:05.425 --> 02:08.970
Mmm, potato salad, coleslaw, and fresh fruit from Mr. Evans.

02:09.010 --> 02:11.052
And that gallon of ice cream from Mayor Arnold.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.075
Oh, boy, I can't wait.

02:13.315 --> 02:15.598
There seems to be an awful lot for just the four of us.

02:15.618 --> 02:17.180
Golly, the folks were generous.

02:17.260 --> 02:19.744
We'll do away with all of it, don't you worry.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.426
You just wait and see.

02:21.446 --> 02:23.749
Do you think Uncle Bill is wondering why we're so late?

02:24.209 --> 02:25.050
Mmm, I don't know.

02:25.311 --> 02:30.137
He told me to take it easy, to bring Joe down from Hawk Tower, and to pick you up at camp.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.860
Sure, but look at the stops we made.

02:32.161 --> 02:35.587
At the McDonald's and Mr. Evans' farm and Mayor Arnold's office.

02:35.607 --> 02:36.769
Stop worrying, June.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.895
Ranger Bill knows we can take care of ourselves.

02:40.015 --> 02:41.938
And that's one thing this summer's given me.

02:42.319 --> 02:44.483
More confidence than I've ever had before.

02:44.583 --> 02:46.807
Oh, it has been a wonderful summer, hasn't it?

02:46.827 --> 02:48.430
Golly, the things we've learned.

02:48.410 --> 02:53.536
Not only how to take care of ourselves, but also how important forests really are.

02:53.837 --> 02:55.359
I know what you mean, Joe.

02:55.379 --> 02:58.162
As Ranger Bill says, there's certainly more than timber in trees.

02:58.322 --> 03:00.385
Wood for a thousand uses.

03:00.405 --> 03:01.006
And water.

03:01.126 --> 03:01.827
To drink.

03:01.847 --> 03:03.028
For irrigation.

03:03.048 --> 03:04.811
And to provide electrical power.

03:04.931 --> 03:05.552
Yes.

03:05.572 --> 03:07.134
And food for livestock.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.116
And food and shelter for wildlife.

03:09.136 --> 03:10.318
Don't forget recreation.

03:10.498 --> 03:12.240
Outdoor fun and relaxation.

03:12.322 --> 03:18.229
But it takes planning, June, and good care to keep the soil fertile and the land producing.

03:18.249 --> 03:22.874
Hey, we sound like a forestry encyclopedia comes to life.

03:22.894 --> 03:25.477
Well, it's not as funny as it may sound, Joe.

03:25.797 --> 03:31.343
We need our forests so very much, but we've just got to take care of them, keep them green and growing.

03:31.363 --> 03:36.329
We certainly were tender feet, yeah, before we met Ranger Bill, weren't we, Sam?

03:36.989 --> 03:40.253
I feel like a wise old woods veteran now, yes, sir.

03:40.233 --> 03:42.355
My, aren't you two really something?

03:42.515 --> 03:43.817
We didn't mean to brag, June.

03:44.277 --> 03:48.221
It's just that, well, as Sam said, we've got real confidence now.

03:48.502 --> 03:49.343
Sure, that's it.

03:49.723 --> 03:56.250
I bet you couldn't lose us in a forest anymore, and I bet there are a few tough situations that we couldn't get out of either.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.353
Well, I wonder what Uncle Bill would think if he heard you two now.

03:59.753 --> 04:01.075
Oh, don't mind her, Joe.

04:01.295 --> 04:02.697
She's jealous, that's all.

04:02.837 --> 04:06.400
Say, look at that sun over there, and it's sinking pretty fast.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.962
We are running late, aren't we?

04:07.942 --> 04:10.205
It'll be dark before we get to the ranger station.

04:10.365 --> 04:12.427
Aha, fear not, little ones.

04:12.447 --> 04:13.288
I have a plan.

04:14.450 --> 04:15.871
Ah, here's the turn I've been looking for.

04:19.776 --> 04:21.338
Sam, where are you going?

04:21.358 --> 04:23.240
Oh, I'm taking a shortcut, June, that's all.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.044
It'll get us to the ranger station in half the time it would take on the highway.

04:27.325 --> 04:30.468
Hey, this is the logging road along Storm Creek, isn't it?

04:30.488 --> 04:31.269
Oh, that's right, Joe.

04:31.590 --> 04:32.711
A real shortcut.

04:33.031 --> 04:35.134
I was over it last year during the big fire.

04:35.414 --> 04:36.075
Last year?

04:36.460 --> 04:37.563
I don't know, Sam.

04:37.803 --> 04:41.693
Ranger Bill has warned us about traveling on roads that we're not sure of.

04:41.753 --> 04:45.823
Maybe we'd better go back to the highway, Sam, even if it does take longer that way.

04:46.084 --> 04:48.470
Golly, don't you have any confidence in this, June?

04:48.490 --> 04:51.978
Well, I... Sure, this is a cinch to get us back in a hurry.

04:51.998 --> 04:53.963
Now, you just relax, June.

04:54.112 --> 04:54.994
Well, all right.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.561
Say, isn't that the most beautiful sunset we've had all summer?

04:59.922 --> 05:01.424
Gee, it's something all right.

05:01.445 --> 05:01.865
Sam.

05:02.126 --> 05:02.667
Yes, June?

05:02.907 --> 05:04.710
Sam, I'm not worried anymore.

05:05.011 --> 05:05.752
Oh, swell.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.775
I told you we'd be all right coming this way.

05:07.976 --> 05:08.677
Hold everything.

05:08.857 --> 05:09.438
What is it?

05:09.458 --> 05:10.360
Look, up ahead there.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.141
Good gravy.

05:11.181 --> 05:14.226
It's a big uprooted tree lying right across the road in front of us.

05:14.246 --> 05:15.208
Say, I'd better stop.

05:20.099 --> 05:22.623
Golly, it is a big tree, isn't it?

05:22.644 --> 05:23.645
What are we going to do?

05:24.246 --> 05:25.849
Gee, I don't know.

05:25.869 --> 05:27.252
Let's go back to the highway, Sam.

05:27.292 --> 05:28.995
There's no place to turn around in June.

05:29.335 --> 05:31.299
We're right on the top of the cliff.

05:31.319 --> 05:33.262
And it's too far to back up all the way.

05:36.148 --> 05:36.849
What was that?

05:37.750 --> 05:38.271
Hey, look.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.255
Look at that.

05:40.275 --> 05:43.120
Yeah, all those rocks and that dirt coming down on the road.

05:43.370 --> 05:44.411
I don't like this, Sam.

05:44.832 --> 05:46.674
That's the result of the fire last year.

05:46.694 --> 05:47.616
Sam, I'm frightened.

05:47.636 --> 05:48.657
Oh, now, June.

05:49.338 --> 05:49.939
Hey, quick!

05:49.959 --> 05:50.840
Get behind the truck!

05:51.220 --> 05:51.661
Look out!

05:52.041 --> 05:53.023
It's a landslide!

05:53.243 --> 06:04.437
And it's right behind us!

06:04.457 --> 06:04.738
June!

06:05.138 --> 06:05.399
June!

06:05.619 --> 06:07.501
Are you all right?

06:07.521 --> 06:08.623
I... I wasn't here.

06:08.643 --> 06:09.524
I'm okay, too.

06:10.405 --> 06:11.807
Golly, were we lucky.

06:12.108 --> 06:13.911
Not a scratch on us or the truck.

06:13.932 --> 06:15.675
And just look at those big rocks.

06:15.915 --> 06:17.458
Oh, but what a mess we're in.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.340
Just the same.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.683
Cray blocking us in front.

06:19.723 --> 06:21.646
Heavy boulders blocking us in the back.

06:21.887 --> 06:22.809
Now what?

06:22.829 --> 06:25.794
I guess we'd better co-range a bill on the shortwave radio.

06:25.814 --> 06:27.197
Yeah, I suppose we'd better.

06:27.397 --> 06:29.459
Well, there goes our surprise party.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.603
Ranger Bill probably will come and help us out of this mess.

06:32.963 --> 06:36.467
He'll see the food and... Oh, doggone the luck anyway.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.009
Call him, Sam.

06:38.029 --> 06:39.831
Maybe everything will work out yet.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.172
Oh, you're swell, June.

06:41.512 --> 06:46.238
Instead of laughing at us for talking so big and acting so mighty, you aren't laughing at all.

06:46.258 --> 06:47.819
Oh, we're all in this together, Sam.

06:47.839 --> 06:50.102
Well, I've learned a lesson, believe me.

06:50.122 --> 06:52.445
And Joe, I'm afraid it was all my fault.

06:52.465 --> 06:53.866
Oh, stop it, both of you.

06:54.287 --> 06:55.648
Sam, call Uncle Bill.

06:55.628 --> 06:57.270
I hope his set's on, that's all.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.392
Well, here goes.

06:59.412 --> 07:02.515
Let her warm up a bit first.

07:02.535 --> 07:04.497
Okay, now.

07:04.537 --> 07:06.499
SP-7 to Beaver Dam Ranger Station.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.082
SP-7 to Beaver Dam Ranger Station.

07:09.423 --> 07:10.484
Come in, Ranger Station.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.806
Ranger Station, back to SP-7.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.748
All right, go ahead, Sam.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.111
Gee, it's almost as though he expected us to call.

07:17.952 --> 07:19.413
Ranger Bill, we're in trouble.

07:19.433 --> 07:20.414
Come in.

07:20.434 --> 07:21.175
Go ahead, Sam.

07:21.295 --> 07:22.176
Golly, he's a problem.

07:22.882 --> 07:26.226
We're on the Storm Creek Road, Ranger Bill, on the edge of the cliff.

07:26.606 --> 07:28.048
Nearly got caught in a landslide.

07:28.369 --> 07:31.492
The truck's blocked by a big tree in front and rocks in the back.

07:31.773 --> 07:33.034
We can't move either way.

07:33.354 --> 07:34.015
Come in, please.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.478
Cut your way out.

07:36.498 --> 07:37.179
Is there anything else?

07:37.559 --> 07:37.860
Come in.

07:38.220 --> 07:39.962
Cut your way out?

07:39.982 --> 07:40.763
What does he mean?

07:41.104 --> 07:43.527
Holy smoke, are we dumb?

07:43.547 --> 07:44.047
Why, sure.

07:44.408 --> 07:48.953
We've got a two-man crosscut saw in the truck, and we can use the saw to cut our way out.

07:49.233 --> 07:50.695
You'd better answer, Ranger Bill, Sam.

07:51.215 --> 07:53.058
SP-7 back to Ranger Station.

07:53.399 --> 07:55.342
Okay, Ranger Bill, we'll make it all right.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.005
SP-7 off.

07:57.025 --> 07:57.686
That's the stuff.

07:58.287 --> 07:59.469
Don't waste time getting here.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.112
Ranger Station off.

08:01.753 --> 08:05.239
Oh, boy, weren't we the prize dumbheads, though?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.464
See, everything's gonna be all right after all.

08:08.731 --> 08:10.675
Hurry, boys, let's get out of here.

08:10.695 --> 08:13.561
It's getting dark and we still have a surprise party on our hands.

08:13.581 --> 08:15.124
Well, I'll get the sauce, Sam.

08:15.144 --> 08:19.373
It's a victory, but we can cut it so that the top end will slide over the cliff.

08:19.814 --> 08:21.738
That'll clear her out of the way, yes, sir.

08:21.798 --> 08:22.900
Well, then, come on, let's go.

08:22.920 --> 08:23.922
Oh, let's go.

08:35.056 --> 08:38.741
Boy, that was some workup, but we certainly did it, didn't we, June?

08:38.801 --> 08:40.222
I'm proud of both of you.

08:40.242 --> 08:41.184
There she blows.

08:41.724 --> 08:43.226
There's our ranger station ahead.

08:43.727 --> 08:46.290
Drive to the back, Sam, where Uncle Bill won't see us.

08:46.310 --> 08:47.431
Then we'll get busy.

08:47.451 --> 08:50.915
I just hope Mr. Glover sends those steaks in time as he promised.

08:50.935 --> 08:51.977
Say, that's funny.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.260
No lights are on in the ranger station.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.801
No lights are showing anywhere.

08:55.821 --> 08:57.604
Well, we'll drive on back anyway.

08:58.024 --> 08:59.486
Say, I wonder where Ranger Bill is.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.308
Oh, he must be around somewhere, Sam.

09:01.328 --> 09:03.351
Don't worry, unless he sees us first.

09:03.371 --> 09:04.472
All right, we can stop here.

09:09.008 --> 09:10.212
All right, you two.

09:10.232 --> 09:11.356
I'll hunt up Ranger Bill.

09:11.637 --> 09:12.781
You get going with the supper.

09:13.202 --> 09:15.329
Well, it's about time you got here.

09:17.135 --> 09:19.664
Hey, where'd all you folks come from?

09:19.684 --> 09:21.550
They were hiding behind the woodchips.

09:21.817 --> 09:22.317
Yeah.

09:22.878 --> 09:24.400
Well, I'll be doggone.

09:24.420 --> 09:26.181
Look, there's Mr. and Mrs. Glover.

09:26.321 --> 09:27.423
And Penny Perkins.

09:27.443 --> 09:29.324
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

09:29.385 --> 09:30.566
And the McDonald's, too.

09:30.706 --> 09:31.567
And Mayor Arnold.

09:31.587 --> 09:32.227
You bet.

09:32.247 --> 09:34.390
And Mr. Evans, how did you get here?

09:34.470 --> 09:35.391
It was easy, June.

09:35.611 --> 09:40.095
After you left my place, I just cranked up the helicopter and, well, it only took me a few minutes.

09:40.596 --> 09:41.457
I don't get it.

09:41.897 --> 09:42.938
I just don't get it.

09:43.218 --> 09:48.183
We planned this as a surprise party for you, Ranger.

09:48.203 --> 09:50.766
Now, you really didn't think you could fool the Ranger, did you, Sam?

09:50.886 --> 09:50.946
No.

09:51.196 --> 09:52.678
Gee, Rancher, I guess not.

09:53.019 --> 09:54.361
Oh, we should have known better.

09:54.421 --> 09:55.582
Well, here, here, here, now.

09:55.983 --> 09:56.504
Brighten up.

09:56.584 --> 09:58.266
Everyone's in on this party.

09:58.286 --> 10:05.817
Now, you two boys have done such a fine job all summer, and you too, June, at your camp, that all of these good friends of yours planned this long before you did.

10:06.138 --> 10:08.321
Land sakes, what are we waiting for?

10:08.341 --> 10:11.526
With all this talking going on, our body won't get anything to eat at all.

10:11.786 --> 10:13.949
You're absolutely right, Mrs. McDonald.

10:13.969 --> 10:14.690
Let's get going.

10:14.730 --> 10:15.772
I'm kind of hungry myself.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.254
But we have to fix supper yet.

10:17.386 --> 10:18.511
Well, it's all fixed, June.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.907
Tom and Betty Glover brought over a big section of barbecued beef.

10:21.928 --> 10:23.937
And you've got prepared food in the truck.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.248
Tables all set alongside the ranger station, so...

10:26.583 --> 10:27.264
Come on, let's go.

10:33.972 --> 10:42.762
Let me tell you, folks, this is the best meal I've had in a long, long time.

10:42.802 --> 10:44.484
I guess that goes for all of us, Mayor Arnold.

10:44.704 --> 10:48.809
Gosh, it's sure going to be tough leaving all of you good people.

10:48.869 --> 10:49.610
None of that, Sam.

10:49.950 --> 10:55.096
Now, you and Joe have Forestry College ahead of you, and there'll be more summers between sessions.

10:55.116 --> 10:55.577
Well, now,

10:55.895 --> 10:58.098
How about a little tune on that harmonica of yours, Sam?

10:58.679 --> 11:01.985
This'll be one farewell banquet that won't have speeches, I'm glad to say.

11:02.185 --> 11:03.427
Hold on a minute, Ranger.

11:03.487 --> 11:04.228
Not so fast.

11:04.969 --> 11:06.051
All right, Mr. McDonald.

11:06.452 --> 11:10.658
I'm not much of a speech maker, Mr. Mayor, but here goes.

11:11.660 --> 11:16.748
Ranger Scott, all these folks kind of elected me to say a few words before we wind up tonight.

11:17.509 --> 11:20.674
And I'm thinking this is as good a time as any to say them.

11:20.694 --> 11:20.934
Oh, come on.

11:20.954 --> 11:21.295
Well...

11:21.899 --> 11:25.042
No, no, Mr. Mac, there's no need for you.

11:25.062 --> 11:25.583
Quiet, man.

11:25.703 --> 11:27.604
Just listen.

11:27.624 --> 11:40.056
Here we are, a mayor of a town, a young rancher and his wife, a young and up-and-coming farmer, a schoolgirl, two schoolgirls, counting you, Miss June, and Sarah and myself, farmers too.

11:40.076 --> 11:45.642
Then there's you, a forest ranger, and the two boys who are planning to go places in forestry.

11:46.723 --> 11:49.665
What brought us all together?

11:49.685 --> 11:50.286
Well, sir...

11:51.160 --> 11:52.582
It was a forest.

11:52.602 --> 11:57.908
But more than that, it was what you're trying to do to help the forest service all better.

11:57.928 --> 11:58.708
Everybody better.

11:59.309 --> 12:00.410
I've made our paths cross.

12:01.712 --> 12:03.894
I just want to say we're mighty proud it happened.

12:04.915 --> 12:08.820
We know now how important it is to manage the forest for the good of all of us.

12:09.560 --> 12:14.686
To keep it safe from overcutting, from bugs and fire, from overgrazing.

12:16.328 --> 12:20.813
And if ever you want to teach other folks the same lesson, you're just calling us.

12:21.248 --> 12:23.250
Ranger Bill, Scott.

12:23.270 --> 12:25.734
We're your friends in the Friends of the Forest.

12:27.135 --> 12:29.638
Well, that's about all I've got to say.

12:33.543 --> 12:34.184
Thank you.

12:35.105 --> 12:35.946
Thank you, Mr. Mac.

12:36.987 --> 12:39.430
Thanks to all of you.

12:39.450 --> 12:42.394
Well, Sam, how about that harmonica now?

12:42.414 --> 13:08.155
Okay, sir. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and auld lang syne?

13:08.155 --> 13:13.260
And as the strains of Auld Lang Syne blend with the night air surrounding the Beaver Dam Ranger Station,

13:13.628 --> 13:23.221
We say so long for a while to Ranger Bill, to June, Joe, and Sam, to all of their good friends, until another time.

13:23.241 --> 13:30.250
Participating in this series on forest conservation have been the following members of the radio workshop of the New York City Board of Education.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.433

13:32.453 --> 13:34.275
Sam was played by Bob Dash.

13:34.295 --> 13:36.278

13:36.781 --> 13:45.674
Other members of the cast included Stan Gurell, Evelyn Leisner, Ilsa Bestman, Philip Gittleman, Alan Roman, Dick Gebhardt, Bob Jasinski, Ruth Ullman, and Dan Melnick.

13:46.155 --> 13:49.700
Sound effects were handled by Dwayne Marshall, Al Argoff, and Tom Connors.

13:50.201 --> 13:52.725
Music was the responsibility of Tom Hartley.

13:52.745 --> 13:54.588
Robert Napier was our harmonica player.

13:55.089 --> 13:57.612
Our engineers were Al Weintraub and Joe Skolnick.

13:58.434 --> 14:04.943
Bill Scott, forest ranger, featuring Glenn Woods as Ranger Bill, has come to you with the cooperation of the Forest Service, U.S.

14:04.983 --> 14:06.045
Department of Agriculture.

14:06.464 --> 14:11.670

14:13.732 --> 15:20.995
