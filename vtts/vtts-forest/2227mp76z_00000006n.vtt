00:00.000 --> 00:08.350
[Silence.]

00:08.350 --> 00:12.408
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:13.071 --> 00:14.718
Hello there, folks.

00:14.738 --> 00:18.073
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:18.391 --> 00:24.101
those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:24.121 --> 00:29.970
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:29.990 --> 00:42.211
Today it's Billy Gray, one of America's favorite teenagers and a very wise young fella who joins his father in knowing what's best.

00:42.231 --> 00:43.032
Say, Billy,

00:43.147 --> 00:49.853
When you asked me to join you for a malted here in the drugstore, I wasn't so sure it was a good idea.

00:50.734 --> 00:56.500
I was afraid your friends would hoot and holler when they saw you talking to a bear, but they've been real nice.

00:57.020 --> 01:00.343
Boy, everyone knows you, Smokey, and what you stand for.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.726
And that goes for the teenagers especially.

01:02.746 --> 01:05.308
We don't goof off all the time, believe me.

01:05.328 --> 01:11.314
I'll bet there isn't a boy or a girl anywhere who doesn't have a pretty good idea of what our forests mean to us and to the welfare of our country.

01:11.564 --> 01:19.253
Those of us who are lucky enough to get into the forest, hunting, fishing, and camping, naturally we have a more personal feeling about the forest values and benefits.

01:19.974 --> 01:26.862
We have a special reason to keep the trees green and growing, and the wildlife and their homes free from wildfire.

01:26.882 --> 01:35.753
You might say we have a personal responsibility to be careful with fire, with matches, smokes, campfires, any fire when we're outdoors, even just driving along.

01:36.654 --> 01:41.520
Yes sir, Smokey, I think you can count on America's young people doing their part in preventing forest fires.

01:41.905 --> 01:44.971
We've got too big a stake in our forest not to.

01:44.991 --> 01:46.274
Now for that chocolate malt.

01:46.294 --> 01:47.075
What'll you have, Smokey?

01:47.656 --> 01:50.903
Well, I'll take wild cherry, Billy.

01:50.923 --> 01:54.429
And then I'll have to be getting back along the timber trail.

01:54.991 --> 01:59.760
You know my friends here, the sons of the pioneers, they love the forest too.

02:02.946 --> 02:03.086
Timber!

02:03.106 --> 02:03.247
Timber!

02:03.267 --> 02:03.407
Timber!

02:05.918 --> 02:11.847
The mountains high, down the canyons wide.

02:11.867 --> 02:17.696
Let me roam and ride, ride through timber.

02:17.716 --> 02:28.652
When the day is done, by the campfires gleam, let me lie and dream, dream of timber.

02:29.474 --> 02:35.082
Tall timbers calling, and the echoes ringing.

02:35.230 --> 02:56.293
for nature sings a song along the timber trail. Blue shadows falling down the canyon's veil and the whispering pines entwine along the timber trail. 
High in the sky

02:56.611 --> 03:19.868
The love song of the trees Will blend and win Its way out on the breeze Tall timbers callin' Timbers and the echoes ring For all nature sings a song 
Along the timber trail High in the sky afar

03:19.848 --> 03:25.414
The love song of the trees will blend and win.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.057
It's way out on the breeze.

03:28.077 --> 03:33.183
Tall timbers callin' and the echoes ring.

03:33.924 --> 03:39.130
For nature sings a song along the timber trail.

03:39.911 --> 03:42.334
The timber trail.

03:42.354 --> 03:44.556
Timber!

03:48.417 --> 03:50.460
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:51.060 --> 03:53.263
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:53.844 --> 03:59.411
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

03:59.451 --> 04:05.799
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.502
Until we say hello there again...

04:08.600 --> 04:24.162
and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:24.462 --> 04:33.258
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowling and a-growling and a-sniffing the air.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.867
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:38.228 --> 04:42.685
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:42.685 --> 05:01.262
[Music.]

05:01.262 --> 05:10.000
[Silence.]
