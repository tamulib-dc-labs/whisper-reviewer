00:28.060 --> 00:29.051
Caught!

00:29.071 --> 00:30.932
Forest Rangers!

00:37.544 --> 00:44.433
Today we present the fourth program in a new series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:44.453 --> 00:46.656
Our scene is Beaver Dam Forest.

00:46.676 --> 00:55.929
The golden light of early morning streams through the trees as three riders make their cautious way toward the open range that marks the forest boundary.

00:55.949 --> 01:00.615
Ranger Bill is astride his spirited young horse Sparks, son of Daisy.

01:00.697 --> 01:11.712
His forestry aides, Joe and Sam, less used to the saddle than the Ranger, are riding a pair of wise old ponies.

01:11.732 --> 01:20.684
As the three horses move along slowly, Joe and Sam edge their mounts closer and closer to Ranger Bill, as though fearful of being left behind.

01:21.585 --> 01:28.594
In the distance, crows wing their way above the treetops, and the sound of their call drifts back to the silent riders.

01:28.878 --> 01:32.083
Joe and Sam stir uneasily on their saddles.

01:32.103 --> 01:34.527
They keep eyeing Ranger Bill's rifle in its scabbard.

01:35.389 --> 01:40.698
The ranger, alert to every sound and movement in the forest, stares intently at the ground.

01:41.459 --> 01:43.543
Suddenly, his body stiffens.

01:44.424 --> 01:47.870
With a gentle tug, he stops his horse and springs lightly to the ground.

01:48.952 --> 01:49.593
All right, boys.

01:50.214 --> 01:50.735
Pile off.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.940
Well, here's what we're looking for.

01:54.764 --> 01:56.470
That carnival lion came this way.

01:56.871 --> 01:58.115
Oh, you found a track.

01:58.136 --> 01:59.039
Is that it, Ranger Bill?

01:59.059 --> 01:59.320
That's right.

01:59.340 --> 02:00.704
Gee, where is the track, Ranger Bill?

02:01.427 --> 02:02.149
I don't see anything.

02:02.250 --> 02:02.771
Oh, here, Sam.

02:03.173 --> 02:03.735
Look here, Joe.

02:04.357 --> 02:05.681
You see the soft spot on the ground?

02:06.063 --> 02:06.203
Uh-huh.

02:06.223 --> 02:07.086
You see the big print?

02:07.623 --> 02:08.805
It's pretty fresh, too.

02:09.465 --> 02:13.771
Golly, I think maybe he's right around here, somewhere close by.

02:14.052 --> 02:15.493
Here's another print.

02:15.514 --> 02:18.017
Oh, he's headed for the open range again, isn't he, Ranger Bill?

02:18.157 --> 02:19.178
That's what I figure, Sam.

02:20.300 --> 02:24.445
Well, boys, believe it or not, those are the tracks of a lion you're looking at.

02:24.465 --> 02:27.389
Wow, and an African lion at that.

02:27.830 --> 02:27.910
Yes.

02:27.890 --> 02:33.377
Oh, I don't mind telling you I'd rather be up on Hawk Tower right now than trailing a mean old lion.

02:34.298 --> 02:36.360
This happens to be a mean young lion, Joe.

02:37.141 --> 02:38.503
You know something, Ranger Bill?

02:38.783 --> 02:39.424
What's that, Sam?

02:39.885 --> 02:41.507
It just doesn't seem real, all this.

02:41.907 --> 02:47.454
You, Joe, and I out here in Beaver Dam Forest trailing an honest-to-goodness lion.

02:47.474 --> 02:50.678
It doesn't make sense, and yet it is true, isn't it?

02:50.698 --> 02:51.739
I'm afraid it is, Sam.

02:53.021 --> 02:56.445
I've been thinking that I've done a lot of strange things as a forest ranger, but...

02:57.117 --> 03:00.149
Well, this doesn't seem quite real to me either.

03:00.169 --> 03:01.253
Easy, easy, Sparks.

03:01.273 --> 03:01.916
Take it easy, boy.

03:03.743 --> 03:05.872
Well, boys, we'd better be getting along.

03:05.892 --> 03:07.277
Let's just follow these tracks along.

03:07.297 --> 03:08.241
We can lead the horses.

03:09.183 --> 03:12.506
Not far to the boundary in the fence line along the open range.

03:12.526 --> 03:12.847
Come on.

03:15.890 --> 03:22.416
All I can say is that any fellow who'd let a wild lion loose ought to be... Well, something ought to be done about him.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.338
Don't be too hasty in passing judgment, Joe.

03:25.259 --> 03:28.022
I happen to know the owner of the carnival that that lion belongs to.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.064
His name is Davis.

03:30.084 --> 03:33.908
And I know that Mr. Davis is concerned as anyone about the animal getting loose.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.793
Because he's a cattle raiser himself.

03:36.033 --> 03:39.684
Just how did the lion escape from that railroad car in town, Ranger?

03:40.325 --> 03:41.529
Somebody was careless, I guess.

03:42.632 --> 03:45.420
You see, Sam, this lion was just brought into the country.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.205
Pretty wild and untrained, I'd say.

03:47.675 --> 03:49.717
And the first real chance he got, he broke out.

03:51.279 --> 03:52.259
Oh.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.421
Well, we're still on his trail.

03:54.161 --> 03:55.122
You see those tracks, boys?

03:55.463 --> 03:56.123
Yeah.

03:56.143 --> 03:59.987
It was a good thing that farmer saw him or we'd never have found his track, I'll bet.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.850
Say, do you think he's really dangerous, Ranger Bill?

04:02.870 --> 04:04.552
Well, he could be, Sam.

04:04.572 --> 04:08.996
There are about a hundred men looking for him, including Mr. Davis and his crew.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.438
Well, there's no telling what a wild lion will do when he's cornered.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.260
Well...

04:13.628 --> 04:17.732
Here's the fence marking the boundary between the Beaver Dam Forest and the private range on the other side.

04:18.112 --> 04:20.094
Gee, this is the first time I've been here.

04:20.114 --> 04:21.355
What do we do now, Ranger Bell?

04:23.037 --> 04:23.918
No more tracks, eh?

04:25.119 --> 04:27.722
He must have jumped the fence, and that means he's taken to the open range.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.445
That's not so good, but come on, boys.

04:32.086 --> 04:33.667
We'll work down along the fence line.

04:33.687 --> 04:35.649
There's a gate about a quarter of a mile south of here.

04:36.570 --> 04:38.932
In the saddle with you, boys.

04:38.952 --> 04:40.113
Easy does it, Sparks.

04:40.133 --> 04:40.934
Take it easy, horse.

04:42.015 --> 04:42.876
You boys all right?

04:43.160 --> 04:47.165
Keep your eyes and ears open, boys.

04:47.185 --> 04:49.528
No telling what we may find from here on out.

04:49.548 --> 04:52.671
Gee, who owns that range land across the fence, Ranger Bill?

04:53.052 --> 04:54.474
A fellow by the name of Tom Glover.

04:55.235 --> 04:59.780
He and his wife, Betty, have just taken over this land and the old house that goes with it.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.562
They're a nice young couple just starting out.

05:02.023 --> 05:02.984
Gee, that's Tom.

05:03.004 --> 05:04.626
What do you mean by that, Sam?

05:04.646 --> 05:08.270
Well, I think that's mighty poor grassland I try to make a living on, that's all.

05:08.290 --> 05:09.331
Ah, you're learning, Sam.

05:10.193 --> 05:13.116
Yes, Tom Glover's going to have quite a job building up this range.

05:13.872 --> 05:15.294
It's had a lot of abuse through the years.

05:15.695 --> 05:17.577
Oh, it's been overgrazed, is that it?

05:17.717 --> 05:18.198
Yes, Joe.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.262
Too many cattle have been put on this grass.

05:21.282 --> 05:25.949
In addition, they've been allowed to graze too early in the spring and too late in the fall.

05:25.969 --> 05:29.514
The grass is another natural feed, just haven't had a chance to restore themselves.

05:29.714 --> 05:34.201
Well, then that means someone's got to plant new grass and restore this range artificially.

05:34.301 --> 05:34.942
That's right, Sam.

05:35.262 --> 05:37.185
Was Tom Glover going to do that, Ranger Bill?

05:37.786 --> 05:42.192
Well, I'm afraid Tom is making the same mistake others have made.

05:42.661 --> 05:45.125
I think he's carrying too many cattle here.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.989
I've talked a bit with him, but... Easy, Sparks.

05:48.510 --> 05:49.111
Easy, easy.

05:49.692 --> 05:50.773
Hold it, boys.

05:50.793 --> 05:54.179
Listen.

05:54.199 --> 05:55.961
Oh, that's just an old cow mooing.

05:56.242 --> 05:57.684
Sure, but she's in trouble of some kind.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.088
Hey, you don't think that line could have... I'm going to find out.

06:00.548 --> 06:01.450
Let's head for the gate, boys.

06:01.830 --> 06:03.032
Keep up with Sparks if you can.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.414
All right, boys, come on.

06:04.815 --> 06:05.496
Come on, get up, get up.

06:21.845 --> 06:23.267
There's Ranger Bill, Sam.

06:23.567 --> 06:24.949
Just up ahead there.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.191
And there's the cow.

06:26.251 --> 06:28.975
Look, Ranger Bill's kneeling down by something on the ground.

06:29.315 --> 06:31.077
See, it's a calf.

06:31.118 --> 06:31.939
Whoa there, boy.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:34.462 --> 06:34.883
Hi, boys.

06:35.824 --> 06:37.286
Golly.

06:37.306 --> 06:39.048
Oh, the lion got the calf.

06:39.829 --> 06:41.171
See, is it dead, Ranger Bill?

06:41.692 --> 06:43.454
I'm afraid so, Sam.

06:43.634 --> 06:44.415
Oh, gosh.

06:44.435 --> 06:45.457
I don't like the looks of this.

06:46.418 --> 06:48.561
Seems to me that lion is killing in his blood.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.622
Pretty obvious he didn't want this calf of food.

06:52.283 --> 06:53.464
I wonder if... What, Ranger Bill?

06:54.064 --> 06:58.368
Well, I was wondering if this was his first kill, and I just hope that... Someone's riding this way, Ranger Bill.

06:58.649 --> 06:59.369
Oh, I see him, Joe.

07:00.050 --> 07:00.931
Looks like Tom Glover.

07:01.131 --> 07:04.894
Gee, I feel sorry for him just starting out and all of this now.

07:04.914 --> 07:06.356
Golly, look at him come.

07:06.416 --> 07:09.319
Hello, Tom.

07:10.279 --> 07:11.781
Another one, huh?

07:11.801 --> 07:12.562
I'm sorry, Tom.

07:12.982 --> 07:15.224
This makes the third calf he's brought down, Ranger.

07:15.925 --> 07:17.226
It's enough to get a man down.

07:17.546 --> 07:17.827
I know.

07:17.847 --> 07:19.408
I know, Tom.

07:20.232 --> 07:24.903
Tom, I'd like you to meet my two young assistants, Joe McGuire and Sam Freeman.

07:24.963 --> 07:25.966
Hi, Mr. Blumberg.

07:25.986 --> 07:26.627
Howdy, boys.

07:27.710 --> 07:29.394
Doggone a luck anyhow.

07:29.434 --> 07:30.316
Don't worry, Tom.

07:30.336 --> 07:31.980
We'll get that lion before too long.

07:32.348 --> 07:34.191
A lot of folks are out after them, you know.

07:34.211 --> 07:38.879
Yeah, but in the meantime, I could be getting in some good licks at reseeding this section of my range.

07:38.899 --> 07:39.159
I know.

07:39.199 --> 07:41.884
Instead of chasing a wild critter all over the country.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.587
Oh, that's too bad, Mr. Glover.

07:44.268 --> 07:49.116
You know, we were talking about that before, about the need to bring back good grass on this range.

07:49.296 --> 07:50.318
That's what I aim to do.

07:50.598 --> 07:52.281
Fine, Tom, but what about your stock?

07:53.003 --> 07:57.690
I guess you're planning to get rid of some of your cattle, aren't you, until this part of your range is ready again?

07:57.710 --> 08:00.874
No, I just thought I'd bunch them all up there at the north end.

08:01.155 --> 08:03.118
Well, the grass is pretty good yet.

08:03.138 --> 08:05.641
I just can't afford to sell any of my stock rangers.

08:05.761 --> 08:08.285
Well, Tom, I don't see how you can afford not to.

08:08.826 --> 08:12.631
Excuse me, Ranger Bill, but don't you think we ought to get back on the trail of the lion?

08:12.892 --> 08:13.893
Oh, of course, Sam.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.497
Tom, this is your lion, and we're at your service.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.461
What would you like us to do now?

08:18.942 --> 08:19.883
Just a minute, Ranger.

08:20.404 --> 08:23.448
What did you mean I can't afford to keep all my stock?

08:23.468 --> 08:27.273
Well, suppose we hit the saddle, Tom, and we can see what we're talking about as we move along.

08:27.934 --> 08:29.195
That lion can't be far off.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.096
Okay, Ranger.

08:30.136 --> 08:46.197
Now, Tom, to get back to what we were talking about, your plan to improve this part of your range is fine, but the rest of it, well, I just don't think it's so good.

08:46.801 --> 08:48.763
You've got too many cattle, Tom, that's all.

08:49.444 --> 08:52.007
They haven't been able to get enough feed on all of your land.

08:52.047 --> 08:56.472
Now you propose to concentrate the same number of stock on just part of your range.

08:56.492 --> 08:58.174
Well, Tom, don't you see what's going to happen?

08:58.895 --> 09:01.518
Hmm, yeah, I see what you're driving at.

09:01.538 --> 09:07.044
You'll be ruining the only good section of land you've got left, because there won't be enough food to go around.

09:07.064 --> 09:08.987
The cattle will still be hungry and underfed.

09:09.908 --> 09:14.353
Well, sure, you'll be restoring this part, but you'll lose out in the long run.

09:14.373 --> 09:16.335
I never thought about it that way.

09:16.754 --> 09:19.478
But look, man, who'd buy the cattle I was willing to sell?

09:20.099 --> 09:21.941
You know yourself, they're pretty scrawny.

09:22.141 --> 09:23.303
Yes, sir.

09:23.683 --> 09:25.406
Say, those were gunshots.

09:25.426 --> 09:27.028
The shooting is off there to the north.

09:27.148 --> 09:28.029
Holy smoke.

09:28.510 --> 09:31.414
My wife Betty is up at the north end of the range where most of our cattle are.

09:31.714 --> 09:31.875
Oh, God.

09:31.895 --> 09:33.056
I left her there standing guard.

09:33.176 --> 09:34.438
Oh, Mrs. Glover may be in trouble.

09:34.939 --> 09:35.840
All right, Sparks.

09:35.860 --> 09:36.321
Get up.

09:36.481 --> 09:36.761
Come on.

09:36.801 --> 09:37.282
Come on.

09:37.602 --> 09:37.843
Get up.

09:37.863 --> 09:38.003
Get up.

09:53.491 --> 09:55.253
Can you see my wife anywhere, Ranger?

09:55.593 --> 09:57.215
Way over there to the left, Tom.

09:57.235 --> 09:57.916
Near that thicket.

09:59.538 --> 10:00.719
The liar must be in the thicket.

10:01.000 --> 10:01.841
Be careful, Betty.

10:01.861 --> 10:02.421
We're coming.

10:02.622 --> 10:04.043
She's raising the gun to her shoulder.

10:04.704 --> 10:05.445
She's going to shoot.

10:07.287 --> 10:07.828
Easy, Sparks.

10:08.388 --> 10:09.049
Easy, easy, boy.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.010
Hold it now.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.772
Are you all right, Betty?

10:12.593 --> 10:13.494
I got him, Tom.

10:13.835 --> 10:14.716
I got him.

10:14.736 --> 10:16.037
Nice going, Mrs. Glover.

10:17.058 --> 10:19.081
Are you sure you're all right, Betty?

10:20.422 --> 10:21.844
I think so, Tom.

10:22.432 --> 10:23.674
Oh, but I'm glad you're here.

10:24.555 --> 10:26.959
Yeah, that big cat's done for.

10:26.999 --> 10:29.644
Took a lot of courage, Mrs. Glover.

10:30.044 --> 10:30.645
Yes, sir.

10:31.066 --> 10:32.749
Bet he's got plenty of that all right.

10:33.610 --> 10:36.154
He was headed straight for me, and I just had to shoot him.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.458
Well, I don't think he could have taken him alive, Mrs. Glover.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.343
Oh, the boys have caught up with us.

10:43.606 --> 10:44.989
Gee, who shot him, Ranger Bill?

10:45.169 --> 10:46.171
This lady here, Joe.

10:46.752 --> 10:47.453
Meet Mrs. Glover.

10:47.873 --> 10:49.536
Oh, I'm proud to meet you, ma'am.

10:49.887 --> 10:51.970
Golly, he was a big fellow, wasn't he?

10:52.330 --> 10:53.411
This is Sam, Mrs. Glover.

10:53.832 --> 10:54.893
These boys work with me.

10:55.074 --> 10:55.774
Hello, boys.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.056
How do you do, Mrs. Glover?

10:57.196 --> 10:59.739
Well, Tom, that's the end of the killer.

11:00.620 --> 11:07.709
You can get back to your regular work now, and we'll be getting back to ours after I've sent word around that the chase is over.

11:07.729 --> 11:13.256
Joe here should be up on Hawk Tower right now looking out for forest fires instead of hunting lions with us.

11:13.817 --> 11:15.119
Wait just a minute, Ranger.

11:15.559 --> 11:16.941
We got the lions, sure, and...

11:17.478 --> 11:19.701
But I'm really no better off than I was before.

11:19.841 --> 11:20.822
How do you mean?

11:20.842 --> 11:23.005
I've still got a tough problem facing me.

11:23.085 --> 11:27.912
And, well, I'd appreciate it if you could help me out on the answers.

11:27.932 --> 11:29.834
That's not as tough as it seems, Tom.

11:30.855 --> 11:31.296
Well, now, look.

11:31.656 --> 11:34.280
You were wondering about selling some of your cattle, weren't you?

11:35.161 --> 11:36.803
And you've agreed that's the thing to do?

11:37.123 --> 11:38.185
How can you, Tom?

11:38.285 --> 11:39.026
Who'd buy them?

11:39.426 --> 11:41.629
I'm looking to the ranger for that answer, Betty.

11:41.910 --> 11:46.776
Tom, you remember the old saying, it's an ill wind that blows no good?

11:47.245 --> 11:50.330
Sure, but I can't see what that's got to do with myself.

11:50.350 --> 11:55.658
Well, look, Tom, this whole business with its wild lion does have a happy side to it, I'm glad to say.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.362
Now, I know Mr. Davis pretty well.

11:58.662 --> 12:01.026
He's the owner of the carnival that the lion belonged to.

12:01.046 --> 12:01.767
That's right, Sam.

12:02.528 --> 12:04.051
And he's also a cattle buyer.

12:04.511 --> 12:09.258
Now, he owns some fine feedlats where range cattle are fattened up for market.

12:09.278 --> 12:10.901
Say, that's mighty interesting.

12:10.961 --> 12:15.548
But still, what does that... Now, look, Tom, I talked with Mr. Davis last night when the lion got away.

12:15.950 --> 12:19.733
Now, he told me he'd make it up to anyone who suffered any damage because of the lions.

12:19.873 --> 12:20.734
Oh, that's swell.

12:21.094 --> 12:22.556
He'll pay for the calves, then.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.238
And he also told me he was looking for stocks to buy.

12:26.199 --> 12:28.661
Now, I'm sure he'll take yours, Tom, and at a good price, too.

12:29.381 --> 12:31.043
In fact, I'll call him right away.

12:31.063 --> 12:33.264
Gosh, I don't know what to say, Ranger.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.006
Now, there's no need to say anything, Tom.

12:35.887 --> 12:37.528
You'll be all right, you and Mrs. Glover.

12:38.949 --> 12:41.932
You're on your way to building up your grassland, and your herd as well.

12:42.792 --> 12:45.855
And you'll find that even with fewer cattle, you'll be getting better beef

12:46.460 --> 12:49.424
better calves, and better money.

12:49.444 --> 12:51.908
Because you'll be restoring and maintaining your grasslands.

12:53.951 --> 12:55.454
Well, let's go, boys.

12:55.994 --> 12:56.836
Easy, Sparks.

12:56.856 --> 12:57.777
Take it easy, boy.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.181
Goodbye, Mrs. Glover.

13:01.062 --> 13:02.885
So long, Tom.

13:02.905 --> 13:04.127
Goodbye, Ranger.

13:04.147 --> 13:04.948
Goodbye, boys.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.111
Thanks for everything.

13:07.131 --> 13:09.114
Oh, gee, look at them back there.

13:09.575 --> 13:11.598
Mr. Glover's got his arm around his wife.

13:11.918 --> 13:13.300
They're a fine couple, all right.

13:14.122 --> 13:15.724
And like many Americans before them,

13:16.430 --> 13:18.552
They're making their home on the rings.

13:18.572 --> 13:20.734
Oh, boy, that's my cue, Ranger Bill.

13:21.095 --> 13:23.177
Come on, Harmonica, do your stuff.

13:24.038 --> 13:40.935
And so Ranger Bill's experience once again has brought new hope to those who depend upon nature's bounty for their happiness and livelihoods.

13:42.080 --> 13:48.930
You've just heard the fourth in a new series of programs on forest conservation with Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

13:48.950 --> 13:54.337
Next week, we're in for another exciting adventure when one of the worst enemies of the forest strikes home.

13:54.357 --> 13:59.545
We'll be joining Ranger Bill and his young assistants again in a story called Wings Over the Forest.

14:00.146 --> 14:06.074
Bill Scott, Forest Ranger, comes to you with a cooperation of the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture.

14:06.455 --> 14:11.682
Bill Scott is written by Bill Berghoffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokaw.

14:11.830 --> 14:14.015
Your narrator had been Whitburner.

14:14.215 --> 14:30.109
The End
