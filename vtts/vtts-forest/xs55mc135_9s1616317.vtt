00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
[Silence.]

00:13.000 --> 00:37.000
[Music.]

00:37.000 --> 00:39.318
Well, all right there, boys.

00:39.358 --> 00:40.059
Thank you a lot.

00:40.079 --> 00:40.780
Thank you a lot.

00:41.121 --> 00:42.563
Howdy, friends.

00:42.583 --> 00:43.504
How are you all today?

00:44.581 --> 00:45.803
Yeah, you guessed it again.

00:45.843 --> 00:46.243
It's me.

00:46.423 --> 00:50.950
Sure enough, Jelly Elliott and all the Knotheads gathered up here under the old pine tree.

00:50.970 --> 00:52.732
We've been hoping you'd come our way again.

00:53.213 --> 00:55.235
Now that you have, we'll just set a spell.

00:55.315 --> 00:55.796
Relax.

00:56.677 --> 00:59.181
We've got some mighty nice tunes picked out here for you.

00:59.802 --> 01:01.364
We hope that you're going to enjoy them.

01:01.404 --> 01:06.771
We've got a little chatter about the woods and forests and things in general that we want to talk to you about.

01:06.791 --> 01:11.297
But first, here's Bob with his fiddle doing an old fiddle tune Down Yonder.

01:11.297 --> 02:20.802
[Music.]

02:20.802 --> 02:21.623
Well, all right.

02:21.643 --> 02:22.223
Thank you, Bob.

02:22.244 --> 02:22.624
Thank you.

02:22.664 --> 02:27.449
I know all you old-timers out there enjoyed that old hoedown down yonder.

02:27.469 --> 02:29.591
Friends, I wanted to tell you about Smokey Bear.

02:29.611 --> 02:33.776
I know most all of you have seen Smokey Bear, probably on posters one place or another.

02:34.556 --> 02:44.827
Well, now, friends, when you see Smokey in his hat and his dungarees, I want you to think of me, too, because both Smokey and me, we're in the same business.

02:44.987 --> 02:46.829
We're on the same side of this team.

02:46.849 --> 02:50.353
We're both fighting for the same thing, the same cause, and all that.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.863
And we want you folks to join that team.

02:54.063 --> 02:55.885
We want you to join us.

02:55.905 --> 02:58.208
I saw something happen the other day, and I wanted to tell you about it.

02:58.648 --> 03:07.578
It was a little girl, looked to be about seven or eight years old, and her daddy and her mother was walking along down the street, and they was coming straight towards me.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.743
Well, sir, the father was smoking a cigarette.

03:12.524 --> 03:19.632
When they got along just about even with me, and there were several people standing around, well, this man, the daddy,

03:20.303 --> 03:23.086
threw his cigarette down there on the sidewall.

03:24.107 --> 03:38.703
Well, they walked several feet on further, and the little girl snatched her hand loose from her daddy, and she whirled around, and she run back there where her daddy had threw this cigarette down, and she stomped it and just ground it down into this concrete sidewall.

03:38.723 --> 03:40.125
Then she went back to her daddy.

03:40.145 --> 03:42.548
Of course, her daddy and mother stopped to see what she was doing.

03:43.529 --> 03:48.394
And she went back to her daddy, and boy, she got on to him.

03:48.654 --> 03:49.315
She told him.

03:49.733 --> 03:57.660
She told him, said, Daddy, you know very well that Smokey Bear wants you to be sure that your cigarette is out, dead out, before you throw it away.

03:58.561 --> 04:01.243
He said, you must not be so careless anymore.

04:01.263 --> 04:05.086
Well, friends, if I'd have been that daddy, I'd have felt like dropping through a nail hole.

04:05.106 --> 04:08.229
And I imagine he felt the same way because he sure turned red.

04:09.230 --> 04:14.374
And, well, he took the little girl's hand and they went on down the street.

04:14.394 --> 04:19.639
Well, I reckon there was 20 or 30 people around there on the street that saw this little show

04:20.277 --> 04:22.399
And it was really interesting.

04:22.419 --> 04:24.161
And that made me mighty proud, friends.

04:24.201 --> 04:25.642
It made me feel mighty good.

04:26.323 --> 04:33.410
That's a good sign that the youngsters are really getting more and more educated to this business of preventing forest and woods fires.

04:34.832 --> 04:40.658
And when I think of it, it was a concrete sidewalk that that fellow threw the cigarette down on.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.820
There was no fire danger whatsoever.

04:42.840 --> 04:47.044
But still, I think of it being such a wonderful thing that this little girl

04:47.564 --> 04:52.991
and Smokey must have reached some kind of agreement to convert her daddy.

04:53.011 --> 04:54.253
Anyhow, here's the next tune.

04:54.633 --> 05:01.503
Here's Charlie to sing this next song, and I want to dedicate this especially from me to every one of you out there listening.

05:01.703 --> 05:03.265
I love everything about you.

05:03.926 --> 05:11.496
[Music.]

05:11.898 --> 05:27.578
I love the dimple in your dimple cheeks, every twinkle in your eyes of blue. I love every little word I hear you speak. I love everything about you.

05:30.983 --> 05:39.235
I love every curl upon your golden head, every little place you put your shoes.

05:39.255 --> 05:42.520
I love every kiss upon your lips of red.

05:42.540 --> 05:47.608
I love everything about you.

05:50.031 --> 05:51.433
Yes, I do.

05:53.957 --> 05:55.219
Yes, I do.

05:57.848 --> 06:04.335
Yes, I love everything about you.

06:04.355 --> 06:10.261
I love every freckle on your turned up nose.

06:10.281 --> 06:13.265
Every little thing you say or do.

06:13.285 --> 06:17.770
I love you from your head to the tip of your toes.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.953
I love everything.

06:21.355 --> 06:38.892
about you.

06:38.892 --> 07:01.687
[Music.]

07:01.687 --> 07:05.352
I love the dimple in your dimple cheeks,

07:05.372 --> 07:09.557
Every twinkle in your eyes are blue.

07:09.577 --> 07:12.722
I love every little word I hear you speak.

07:13.443 --> 07:18.049
I love everything about you.

07:19.190 --> 07:25.158
I love every curl up on your golden head,

07:25.178 --> 07:28.082
Every little place you put your shoes.

07:29.260 --> 07:54.981
I love every kiss upon your lips of red. I love everything about you. Yes I do. Yes I do. Yes I love everything about you.

07:56.783 --> 08:04.052
I love every freckle on your turned-up nose, every little thing you say or do.

08:05.153 --> 08:08.997
I love you from your head to the tip of your toes.

08:09.018 --> 08:16.486
I love everything about you.

08:17.968 --> 08:19.009
Thank you, Charlie, thank you.

08:19.029 --> 08:20.511
That was mighty nicely done there.

08:20.531 --> 08:22.293
Don't forget, friends, that's from me to you.

08:23.054 --> 08:24.556
Now, I got some rules here.

08:24.616 --> 08:26.318
Smokey, he's got some rules that, uh,

08:26.787 --> 08:28.069
I want to pass on to you.

08:28.469 --> 08:30.011
And here's just a few simple rules.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.715
If you'll practice, I think you'll come out a lot better.

08:32.735 --> 08:36.040
You crush out your smokes at home and outdoors.

08:36.060 --> 08:37.502
That's rule number one.

08:37.882 --> 08:40.105
Number two, break your matching tube.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.649
When you do that, you know it's out.

08:42.669 --> 08:43.490
Here's number three.

08:43.931 --> 08:45.833
Drown your campfire, friends.

08:45.853 --> 08:48.497
Drown them and make sure they're dead out.

08:48.517 --> 08:49.318
Here's number four.

08:49.899 --> 08:50.840
Use care in burning.

08:50.920 --> 08:55.446
First of all, have plenty of help and tools, water handy.

08:55.466 --> 08:56.608
Be careful when you burn.

08:56.875 --> 09:02.546
Always get in touch with your local fire warden and notify them you're going to burn.

09:02.606 --> 09:04.750
Here's the next tune, and Herman's going to play this one.

09:05.391 --> 09:06.954
The Steel Guitar Rag.

09:06.954 --> 09:58.537
[Music.]

09:58.537 --> 10:00.819
Thank you, Herman.

10:00.839 --> 10:18.436
Thank you, boys.

10:18.456 --> 10:21.880
That was very nicely wrapped up there, the old Steel Guitar Rag.

10:21.900 --> 10:28.206
Friends, this is the last program in this series, and I wanted all the boys and myself to tell you

10:28.422 --> 10:31.285
goodbye here before we finish the program.

10:31.305 --> 10:35.931
And I'm going to bring them all up here one at a time and let them tell you goodbye in their own words.

10:36.471 --> 10:41.697
So I'll start out with Herman, the boy that plays the steel guitar and has played all these tunes for you.

10:41.717 --> 10:44.761
And Herman certainly hopes that you've enjoyed his steel playing.

10:44.801 --> 10:47.308
So I'm going to let Herman tell you goodbye for this time.

10:47.308 --> 11:01.075
[Music.]

11:01.075 --> 11:01.836
Thank you, Herman.

11:01.896 --> 11:02.317
Thank you.

11:02.637 --> 11:04.420
That was mighty nice, buddy.

11:04.440 --> 11:09.587
Then we'll drop over to Bob, Bob Henderson, who plays the champion hoedown fiddle.

11:10.248 --> 11:14.294
And I'm going to get Bob to come up here and tell you goodbye in his own way.

11:14.294 --> 11:23.768
[Music.]

11:23.768 --> 11:25.811
Well, Bob, that sounds mighty good there, boy.

11:26.952 --> 11:30.357
Then we got Ray that plays the rhythm guitar and sings a lot of songs.

11:30.792 --> 11:34.376
And Ray hopes that you've enjoyed his songs and his rhythm playing.

11:35.397 --> 11:38.760
So I'm going to get Ray to say goodbye for this time in his own way.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.363
[Music.]

11:42.363 --> 11:43.204
Well, thank you, Ray.

11:43.264 --> 11:43.625
Thank you.

11:43.645 --> 11:45.667
That was a sort of a short goodbye there, wasn't it?

11:46.167 --> 11:48.770
Then we got Charlie Stuckey back off over in the corner.

11:48.810 --> 11:50.572
Charlie Stuckey is stuck in the corner.

11:52.654 --> 11:55.877
Yeah, we're going to get Charlie to... He plays the bass fiddle, you remember?

11:56.157 --> 11:58.099
Charlie does and sings a lot of songs and

11:58.467 --> 12:04.841
Charlie says that he hopes you've enjoyed his songs and his bass playing, so I'll ask Charlie to say goodbye in his own way this time.

12:04.841 --> 12:10.465
[Music.]

12:10.465 --> 12:12.308
Sounded more like a bee in a jug, didn't it?

12:12.829 --> 12:13.730
Well, thank you, Charlie.

12:13.790 --> 12:14.451
Thank you a lot.

12:14.471 --> 12:17.476
And me, friends, I don't never say goodbye.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.920
I just don't believe in saying goodbye.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.445
About all I can say to you this time, friends, on this series...

12:23.864 --> 12:26.828
to let you know that it's me, Jelly Elliott, is Suey!

12:28.510 --> 12:30.051
And I'll be seeing you again soon.

12:30.552 --> 12:34.877
Friends, we've run out of time here under the old pine tree, and we're going to have to go.

12:34.897 --> 12:39.583
But here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you for the last time on this series.

12:40.364 --> 12:44.468
Until we meet again, my friends, I wish you happiness and health.

12:45.249 --> 12:47.492
Please keep in mind the things I've said.

12:47.894 --> 13:02.315
and help protect your forest wealth.

13:02.675 --> 13:07.322
Well, friends, we've certainly enjoyed this little visit with you, and we hope that you've enjoyed it.

13:07.342 --> 13:11.568
As I told you, this is the last program in this series, but we'll be back.

13:11.588 --> 13:13.210
We hope to see you again soon.

13:14.388 --> 13:28.026
Friends, don't forget that this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:28.046 --> 13:32.572
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

13:32.592 --> 14:09.995
[Music.]
