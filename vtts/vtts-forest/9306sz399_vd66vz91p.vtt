00:00.000 --> 00:14.408
[Silence.]

00:14.408 --> 00:40.000
[Music.]

00:40.000 --> 00:42.812
Thank you, boys, thank you.

00:43.028 --> 00:43.589
Howdy, friends.

00:43.609 --> 00:44.751
How y'all?

00:44.771 --> 00:45.052
Yes, sir.

00:45.112 --> 00:48.238
Now that we're together again, I've been wishing we'd get together.

00:48.258 --> 00:50.462
Just pull up a chair there and relax.

00:50.482 --> 00:53.247
We're going to play some of these old corny hillbilly tunes for you.

00:53.648 --> 00:55.832
And we got a few things we want to talk to you about.

00:56.192 --> 00:58.236
The woods, you know, the woods out in...

00:58.469 --> 00:58.910
Woods.

00:59.130 --> 01:00.032
Yes, sir.

01:00.052 --> 01:08.946
And don't forget, friends, that these programs is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own state forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service.

01:08.966 --> 01:18.942
Here we go, the first tune featuring Herman Populus, yes, sir, on his little steel guitar playing the Roadside Rag.

01:18.942 --> 02:16.617
[Music.]

02:16.617 --> 02:20.102
Well, all right, sold out, Doc.

02:20.142 --> 02:21.344
Another soul made happy.

02:22.505 --> 02:22.946
Yes, sir.

02:23.266 --> 02:26.651
Friends, I guess you recognize we've got some new Knotheads here.

02:27.072 --> 02:28.393
Yeah, we've got some new Knotheads.

02:28.433 --> 02:33.981
And I guess before we get any further into this thing here, I may as well introduce you to them.

02:34.001 --> 02:36.364
I wish it was so you could see them.

02:36.384 --> 02:39.990
But you sure be surprised.

02:40.010 --> 02:42.773
But I'll start with Ray.

02:42.813 --> 02:46.118
Ray plays the rhythm guitar, and he sings a lot of nice songs.

02:46.199 --> 02:49.985
And he's going to sing some songs for you from time to time here on these programs.

02:50.306 --> 02:51.468
And I know you're going to enjoy them.

02:51.829 --> 02:52.950
Yes, it's Ray Parker.

02:52.970 --> 02:53.211
Ray.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.174
Hi there, friends.

02:56.336 --> 02:56.917
Thank you, buddy.

02:56.937 --> 02:57.658
Thank you.

02:57.678 --> 03:02.787
And then, of course, friends, I know you recognize that steel, steel guitar back there in the back.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.029
I know you recognize that.

03:04.049 --> 03:04.991
That is Ms.

03:05.111 --> 03:06.133
Populus' little boy.

03:06.213 --> 03:08.697
Herman Peek by Pook by Poodle Doodle Populus.

03:12.119 --> 03:13.843
Ain't that puny, I'm telling you.

03:14.304 --> 03:15.988
Then we got a fiddle player over here.

03:16.770 --> 03:17.652
We got a fiddle player.

03:17.812 --> 03:27.093
As I've said before, he sold garden seed from house to house for three weeks to get this fiddle, and he got it, and he learned to play it.

03:27.414 --> 03:28.175
And here he is.

03:28.195 --> 03:29.318
It's Bob Henderson.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.013
That sounds pretty good, son.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.535
What is that, cross-court?

03:35.497 --> 03:36.978
Then we got a man with a burden.

03:37.159 --> 03:39.802
Yes, there's always got to be somebody with a burden.

03:39.822 --> 03:40.963
And it ain't me this year.

03:41.364 --> 03:43.987
No, sir, it's Charlie Stuckey with the bass fiddle.

03:44.007 --> 03:44.327
Charlie?

03:47.171 --> 03:47.551
Thank you.

03:47.772 --> 03:48.693
Thank you, Charlie.

03:48.713 --> 03:49.093
Thank you.

03:50.014 --> 03:53.278
Now that you know the voice, friends, well, I'm glad to know you.

03:53.999 --> 03:55.201
Now let's put them all together.

03:55.321 --> 04:01.228
Put them all together, and here we go with Bob Henderson leading off here with a little old hoedown called Fire on the Mountain.

04:01.228 --> 04:57.884
[Music.]

04:57.884 --> 05:00.176
Thank you, Bob, thank you.

05:00.196 --> 05:02.820
That's what I call real hoedown fiddling now.

05:03.241 --> 05:04.583
That's all right there.

05:04.603 --> 05:08.128
Friends, you know, it's kind of funny how I run into these Knotheads.

05:08.589 --> 05:11.994
I found these boys, we all run together out on a big fire.

05:12.014 --> 05:13.436
We was all fighting fire.

05:13.777 --> 05:16.501
I'm telling you, it was sort of a squally time there.

05:16.521 --> 05:17.382
It was really bad.

05:17.402 --> 05:20.507
The wind was blowing, and the fire was really going strong.

05:20.791 --> 05:23.614
And these boys was right out there fighting that fire.

05:23.635 --> 05:26.118
And, well, everybody was out there.

05:26.138 --> 05:32.946
And when I found them out there fighting fire and found out they could fiddle as well as they could fight fire, well, we got together right then.

05:33.747 --> 05:40.295
But getting back to the fire, I learned something on this fire, friends, that I didn't even know myself.

05:40.315 --> 05:42.858
And I want to pass it on to you folks in just a minute.

05:42.898 --> 05:46.022
But first, we're going to feature Charlie Stuckey here on the bass fiddle.

05:46.383 --> 05:47.524
I mean, Charlie's going to sing.

05:47.977 --> 05:49.761
But he plays the bass fiddle.

05:50.282 --> 05:52.868
And, Charlie, you want me to play the bass fiddle for you?

05:52.888 --> 05:53.449
No, that's all right.

05:53.469 --> 05:53.709
Okay.

05:53.910 --> 05:54.872
All right, you play the bass fiddle.

05:54.892 --> 06:02.408
Here's Charlie to sing, My Baby Lied to Me.

06:02.557 --> 06:08.265
Last night I got a phone call from my honeybee.

06:08.666 --> 06:12.031
She said, oh, Charles, my darling, won't you listen to me?

06:12.371 --> 06:15.977
I've got to break the date that we had tonight.

06:16.017 --> 06:19.382
I've suddenly caught the measles and my face looks aside.

06:19.682 --> 06:23.147
You'd better not come over or you'll get them too.

06:23.127 --> 06:40.663
I've got to hang up now remember I love you. She lied and lied and lied and cried and cried and cried and tried and tried and tried to make a fool of me 
but I was at the window when I saw her holding tight and I know my baby lied to me.

06:40.663 --> 07:03.208
[Music.]

07:04.859 --> 07:12.391
I got up and put my coat on and hurried over to see whether or not my sugar babe was lying to me.

07:12.792 --> 07:16.438
I looked in at the window and I got a great surprise.

07:16.498 --> 07:20.064
She didn't have the measles, there's no spots before my eyes.

07:20.445 --> 07:26.715
I looked a little closer and then I could see there was another man my baby lied to

07:26.695 --> 07:27.517
to me.

07:27.998 --> 07:35.512
She lied and lied and lied and lied and cried and cried and cried and cried and tried and tried and tried to make a fool of me.

07:35.913 --> 07:42.105
But I was at the window when I saw her holding tight and I know my baby lied to me.

07:45.325 --> 07:46.046
Thank you, Charlie.

07:46.106 --> 07:46.506
Thank you.

07:46.526 --> 07:47.067
There it is.

07:48.048 --> 07:49.130
My baby lied to me.

07:49.190 --> 07:50.031
That's awful, ain't it?

07:50.652 --> 08:07.553
Friends, I wanted to tell you about this woods fire, forest fire, and all the things that happened when we was out there fighting this fire and the things that burned and things that I hadn't quite thought of before in connection with these woods fires and all that sort of thing.

08:07.593 --> 08:08.113
The smoke.

08:08.394 --> 08:10.677
The smoke was so bad, friends, you know, it was awful dry.

08:10.697 --> 08:14.381
And the smoke was so bad that airplane travel was cut down.

08:14.401 --> 08:15.062
That's facts.

08:15.278 --> 08:16.540
They couldn't see where they was going.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.882
The smoke was so thick.

08:18.022 --> 08:24.632
And pilots that was being trained by Uncle Sam last time, they couldn't go up and train on account of the smoke being so thick.

08:24.652 --> 08:26.094
Now, did you ever stop to think of that?

08:26.495 --> 08:32.764
I never had before, but after I run into it, well then, it's just plain as a nose on your face.

08:33.588 --> 08:59.308
Defense goods was delayed. Everything was shut down. There it was really bad and there was a defense plant right near this woods fire there, and men had 
to leave their jobs important jobs to come out and help fight fire and on top of that this defense factory itself was in danger and for a while there it 
was kind of tough going. I'll tell you it looked like we was fighting a losing battle and and

08:59.575 --> 09:01.939
I'll tell you it was rough.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.081
I just wished it was so.

09:03.702 --> 09:08.751
I don't like to see a fire, but I wished it was so everybody could see a fire of this kind.

09:09.211 --> 09:17.866
I'll guarantee you you'd be more careful with your fires and matches and cigarettes and things of that kind if you could see the things that I've seen this year.

09:18.367 --> 09:19.889
Friends, it was really rough.

09:20.691 --> 09:24.958
I know I was right there among it, and I know I can tell you just how it happened.

09:25.276 --> 09:28.220
And after this fire had gone on, the little trees died.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.902
Everything died.

09:29.922 --> 09:34.748
And there was a picnic, was a public picnic grounds there that this fire went through.

09:35.408 --> 09:41.316
And now, this picnic grounds, friends, is why a polecat wouldn't even walk through it.

09:41.876 --> 09:44.840
Much less somebody go out to picnic and spread out a lunch and all.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.342
It's completely ruined.

09:46.362 --> 09:48.344
All the little trees are dead.

09:48.364 --> 09:50.226
Even the big trees are dead.

09:50.246 --> 09:54.051
And there was a, on this particular fire, friends, there was a forester.

09:54.773 --> 10:01.862
a forester, went through there and took a sample of 20 trees, 20 big pine trees.

10:01.882 --> 10:03.003
He took a sample.

10:03.023 --> 10:05.446
And out of the 20 trees, there were 19 dead.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.188
Now, can you imagine that?

10:07.669 --> 10:08.690
Well, that actually happened.

10:08.970 --> 10:09.691
That's a fact.

10:10.212 --> 10:10.772
It sure did.

10:11.493 --> 10:13.356
Everything's lost.

10:13.376 --> 10:17.220
I mean, they lost the beauty, and there's no picnic grounds left.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.302
There's no campgrounds.

10:18.322 --> 10:19.643
There's no little timber left.

10:19.663 --> 10:20.584
There's nothing left.

10:20.604 --> 10:22.907
And it was really bad.

10:23.168 --> 10:23.548
I just...

10:24.507 --> 10:28.612
Had it on my mind and I wanted to pass it on to you.

10:28.632 --> 10:30.735
Because the squirrels lost their homes.

10:30.775 --> 10:32.157
The birds lost their homes.

10:32.998 --> 10:33.999
Everything was lost.

10:34.019 --> 10:37.223
There's no way you can win with fire, I'll tell you.

10:37.824 --> 10:41.548
If fire, loose fire like that, it just costs.

10:41.568 --> 10:44.072
I don't care how small a fire it is or how big it is.

10:44.732 --> 10:45.613
Everybody loses.

10:45.634 --> 10:47.356
You lose, I lose, we all lose.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.699
Because after all, we all depend on it.

10:50.339 --> 10:52.422
And I know that you'll help me

10:52.908 --> 11:12.274
in the future to be more careful with cigarettes, matches, and campfires and picnic fires and all that sort of thing, because this very fire that got 
started here that caused all this damage and shut this factory down for one full day, and some of them lost more than that, was caused from carelessness.

11:12.674 --> 11:14.637
Pure carelessness was all it caused.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.460
So be more careful, friends.

11:17.701 --> 11:18.362
I know you will.

11:18.902 --> 11:19.804
Here's another tune.

11:20.424 --> 11:21.666
I believe Bob Henderson's going to

11:21.848 --> 11:22.530
Sing this one.

11:22.550 --> 11:23.232
Is that right, Bob?

11:23.252 --> 11:23.934
You're going to warble?

11:24.576 --> 11:28.026
I thought I'd tell you what he's going to do before he started so you'll know what he's doing.

11:28.046 --> 11:34.103
He's going to sing a little tune called Tugboat.

11:34.103 --> 12:42.545
[Music.]

12:42.545 --> 12:46.130
Thank you, Bob.

12:46.150 --> 12:49.334
I thought you was going to sing there, boy, but that fiddling was all right.

12:49.574 --> 12:55.101
Friends, we're about to run out of time here, but before we go, I got just a little thought for the day I'd like to leave with you.

12:55.702 --> 13:00.348
Now, here's something to remember, friends, a lesson we must learn.

13:00.368 --> 13:06.156
Not only trees and land gets hurt, but we suffer, too, when forests burn.

13:12.194 --> 13:35.805
well friends we gotta go that takes up all our time for this time but the local announcer will let you know when we'll be back and don't forget friends this program is made possible and brought to you the best wishes and compliments of your own state forest service and uncle sam's forest service remember friends only you can prevent forest fires

13:35.805 --> 14:21.761
[Music.]

14:21.761 --> 14:36.000
[Silence.]
