00:10.848 --> 00:38.658
[Music.]

00:38.658 --> 00:41.362
Oh, boy, we're really feeling good here today, friends.

00:41.382 --> 00:44.466
Here it is once again, time for Jelly Elliott and the three knotheads.

00:44.887 --> 00:52.558
Just sitting here under the old pine tree, showing out and showing our ignorance and having a good time and really enjoying ourselves.

00:52.598 --> 00:57.024
We'd like for you to sit around a spell there and enjoy yourselves with us.

00:57.084 --> 01:00.228
If you can, we'd like to have you listen.

01:00.248 --> 01:04.294
We got a few tunes here all lined up, and we've been practicing and

01:04.780 --> 01:21.051
The first one features Robert in his strata potato garden seed fiddle on a tune called Lone Star Rag.

01:21.051 --> 02:03.910
[Music.]

02:03.910 --> 02:29.313
Thank you, boys, thank you.

02:29.653 --> 02:33.597
Well, George, you know I like to never got in the right key, did I?

02:33.830 --> 02:39.655
That bass fiddled, I'm telling you, I was trying to get the thing under my chin, and couldn't make it.

02:39.675 --> 02:42.738
Well, there it was, anyhow, the old Long Star Rag.

02:42.758 --> 02:52.186
You know, I got a little story here, friends, I wanted to pass on out to you that I, the list that I know that happened up in our neck of the woods.

02:52.206 --> 03:03.076
It was a man and his wife lived up there, pretty close neighbors there, and they were mighty nice people, just good old-fashioned, good-hearted country people.

03:03.096 --> 03:03.516
And, uh,

03:04.222 --> 03:16.778
So the missus, she decided there one day that her and the old man, they were kind of getting behind with their charity and first one thing or another, and she figured it was about time for them to do something for the community.

03:17.900 --> 03:25.750
Well, the graveyard, the country graveyard there, it had kind of gone lacking, and she figured it needed cleaning off.

03:26.731 --> 03:30.516
So they figured it would be a good thing to go down and clean off the graveyards.

03:31.340 --> 03:36.527
It had a lot of grass and weeds and stuff growed up on it, so the old man, he got some holes and shovels and things.

03:36.547 --> 03:40.532
They went down and looked it over and decided, well, the quickest way to get it cleaned would be just burn it off.

03:41.273 --> 03:47.882
Well, it happened to be dry, and the old man, he looked around, you know, and there didn't seem to be too much wind.

03:47.902 --> 03:51.467
So he got over on one side of the graveyard and set her on fire.

03:51.487 --> 03:55.051
Got him some grass and got it to burn it good and just strode it all across there.

03:56.073 --> 04:00.098
Well, friends, sure enough, it happened, as it happens lots of times.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.355
There was more wind than they thought there was.

04:02.916 --> 04:07.140
First thing he knew, the graveyard was clean all right, but so was the whole country around there.

04:07.640 --> 04:12.125
And he'd come out near getting up into the little old town, our little town up there.

04:12.646 --> 04:14.327
He'd come out near getting into the town.

04:14.688 --> 04:24.798
We had to get out all the Forrester boys there and myself, along with the people that lived around the community and people that lived there in the little old town, and we had a hard time putting the fire out.

04:25.599 --> 04:29.123
Well, they started out to do a good deed,

04:29.508 --> 04:33.394
But it ended up doing an awful lot of damage.

04:33.934 --> 04:39.843
Just think of all the little timber, little trees, young trees that were sent to the graveyard.

04:39.863 --> 04:40.925
It sure was.

04:40.945 --> 04:41.445
Lots of them.

04:41.986 --> 04:44.450
Now, those people had a good thing at heart.

04:44.470 --> 04:50.959
And you know, friends, when you start to burn anything and you look around, look up at the treetops and all, there don't seem to be much wind.

04:51.327 --> 04:54.390
But you just start a little fire there, as you've probably already done.

04:54.871 --> 04:57.734
And notice how fast that thing will go crawling on the ground.

04:57.754 --> 04:58.374
It'll get gone.

04:58.394 --> 04:59.536
It don't take much wind.

04:59.556 --> 05:03.620
Just a real light breeze will really spread fire out.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.203
And you just got to be careful with it.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.444
You can't be too careful.

05:08.024 --> 05:10.467
You ought to have some water around there.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.309
Be sure there's help.

05:12.389 --> 05:14.691
You can get help immediately if you need it.

05:14.711 --> 05:16.713
And you just can't be too careful.

05:17.354 --> 05:18.195
That's the point.

05:18.850 --> 05:22.615
We just got to be more careful with these forests and grass and woods fires.

05:22.635 --> 05:23.556
That's all there is to it.

05:23.776 --> 05:26.520
I wanted to tell you some more, but I guess I better play another tune here.

05:27.441 --> 05:29.243
We're going to get Slim to come up here.

05:29.644 --> 05:30.966
Slim, he's the only boy Ms.

05:31.006 --> 05:32.708
Watts got named Slim.

05:32.728 --> 05:34.250
And he's going to sing this next tune.

05:34.310 --> 05:35.491
It's a mighty pretty tune.

05:35.532 --> 05:37.194
And friends, we hope you enjoy it.

05:37.214 --> 05:39.036
Just a Closer Walk with Thee.

05:39.036 --> 05:47.673
[Music.]

05:47.673 --> 05:57.446
I am weak, but thou art strong.

06:00.089 --> 06:07.199
Jesus, keep me from all wrong.

06:10.563 --> 06:15.570
I'll be satisfied as long.

06:16.985 --> 06:24.677
As I walk, let me walk close to thee.

06:28.283 --> 06:34.553
Just a closer walk with thee.

06:38.139 --> 06:43.988
Grant this Jesus is my plea.

06:49.756 --> 07:13.047
Let me walk close to thee. Let it be, dear Lord, let it be. When my feeble life is o'er,

07:18.359 --> 07:43.388
for me will be no more. Guide me gently safely o'er to thy kingdom sure to thy shore.

07:45.764 --> 08:11.485
Just a closer walk with thee. Grant it Jesus is my plea. I'll be satisfied as long

08:14.452 --> 08:25.546
As I walk, let me walk close to thee.

08:25.566 --> 08:26.707
Thank you, Slim, thank you.

08:27.428 --> 08:34.517
Well, you know, there's a lot of things here about fires and all that sort of stuff, fires in particular.

08:34.537 --> 08:40.645
They get loose and run wild through the woods just because some people are just not careful enough.

08:41.266 --> 08:42.067
with trash.

08:42.267 --> 08:43.428
You take like the trash.

08:43.729 --> 08:48.834
You tell Junior to get the trash and carry it out in the backyard and do away with it.

08:48.894 --> 08:49.214
Burn it.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.417
Well, naturally, that's what he's going to do.

08:51.557 --> 08:53.539
The first thing he thinks of is burn the trash.

08:53.559 --> 08:59.004
And he goes out there, little fella, just as honest as he can be about it, you know, and trying to help Mama.

08:59.044 --> 09:05.491
And he runs out and pours the trash out there on the ground, sticks a match to it, and then he's got to go on and play Mama Peg or a game of ball or something.

09:05.511 --> 09:06.312
First thing you know,

09:06.562 --> 09:13.033
The backyard catches a fire, and it spreads off out through the edge of the woods, and then the whole countryside is burned off.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.796
Oh, you just can't be too careful.

09:14.836 --> 09:20.947
Friends, there's a few rules, a few simple rules that you can go by that will help us.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.472
I say us because we are all in this thing.

09:23.492 --> 09:24.774
One of us can't do it.

09:24.794 --> 09:25.695
Two of us can't do it.

09:25.716 --> 09:26.918
It takes all of us.

09:26.938 --> 09:28.300
There's a few little simple rules.

09:28.820 --> 09:30.142
First, you get a permit.

09:30.162 --> 09:36.130
If the state law is required, you get this permit from your local fire warden or the forester fellow there.

09:36.150 --> 09:38.693
That forester fellow, he'll be glad to help you.

09:38.713 --> 09:42.979
And then when you go to burn brush or anything of that kind, pile it in small piles.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.721
You can do a much better job burning it.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.143
It'll burn up better and quicker.

09:46.604 --> 09:49.828
You don't have all those big chunks and old burn-ins laying around the thing.

09:50.369 --> 09:51.811
Pick a sort of a damp day.

09:52.411 --> 09:56.637
Or you might hitch old roadie to the turning plow there and plow fur around.

09:57.538 --> 09:58.219
It'll keep the

09:58.435 --> 09:59.797
fire from scattering out.

10:00.438 --> 10:02.221
Burn late in the afternoon.

10:02.241 --> 10:04.364
Have plenty of tools and water.

10:04.384 --> 10:08.650
Be sure that your neighbor knows you're going to burn, and so he might run in and help you.

10:08.951 --> 10:15.961
Shucks, I guess y'all already know all this stuff, friend, but I'm just merely reminding you of it, and just please be careful of them fires.

10:15.981 --> 10:16.782
Here's the next tune.

10:16.802 --> 10:17.864
We're going to feature Charlie.

10:18.264 --> 10:20.868
That's the only boy Miss Tyler's got named Charlie.

10:21.109 --> 10:22.751
He's going to play the steel here.

10:22.771 --> 10:25.455
A beautiful Hawaiian tune, Hawaiian Sunset.

10:25.455 --> 12:29.973
[Music.]

12:29.973 --> 12:31.415
Thank you, Charlie.

12:31.755 --> 12:32.936
Friends, we've run out of time.

12:32.956 --> 12:34.959
The old clock on the wall is caught up with us.

12:34.979 --> 12:37.842
We're going to have to saddle up our horses and shove off down the trail.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.565
We've enjoyed sitting here on the pine tree with you.

12:40.585 --> 12:43.648
And here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you.

12:43.889 --> 12:44.910
I want you to think about it.

12:45.891 --> 12:55.742
Now, you folks that live out near the fields and woods and you've got some burning to do, remember that fire can be good or bad.

12:56.503 --> 12:58.545
And it's always up to you.

12:59.673 --> 13:14.879
Well, friends, this brings this little session to a close here.

13:14.899 --> 13:17.884
We've really enjoyed sitting here in the old pine tree playing for you.

13:18.445 --> 13:21.090
We've done our best to play the tunes that you want to hear.

13:21.458 --> 13:33.055
Now don't forget, friends, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:33.616 --> 13:38.303
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:38.303 --> 14:10.257
[Music.]
