00:01.735 --> 00:05.282
This is a fragment of another very old English ballad, that's all I remember.

00:06.425 --> 00:07.387
Love Lie William.

00:08.449 --> 00:15.203
There's a tree in father's garden.

00:15.223 --> 00:21.195
Love Lie William says she...

00:21.530 --> 00:33.370
Where young men and young maidens, they wait there for me.

00:33.430 --> 00:45.310
Where my father lies in love, brave deeds for to do.

00:46.049 --> 01:01.645
With a long and silver dagger, keep his true love through.
