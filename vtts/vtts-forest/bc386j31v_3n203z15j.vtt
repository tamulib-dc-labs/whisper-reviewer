00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
[Silence.]

00:05.000 --> 00:31.553
[Music.]

00:31.553 --> 00:33.035
Oh!

00:34.456 --> 00:35.097
Thank you, boys.

00:35.117 --> 00:35.458
Thank you.

00:35.478 --> 00:36.078
That's your friends.

00:36.098 --> 00:36.659
You guessed it.

00:36.959 --> 00:37.900
Here it is once again.

00:37.940 --> 00:39.542
Time for Jelly Elliot and the Knotheads.

00:39.562 --> 00:46.571
We're sitting here under the old pine tree, just relaxed and enjoying ourselves, and that's what we want you to do for the next few minutes.

00:47.071 --> 00:51.356
Just gather yourself up there and sit down and take it easy for a few minutes there.

00:51.396 --> 00:58.084
We're going to play a few tunes here and have a little chatter with you and all this sort of stuff and things and

00:58.773 --> 01:00.519
Speaking of stuff, here it is.

01:00.559 --> 01:02.726
We got a little stuff right here to start things off.

01:02.806 --> 01:03.830
It features Jack.

01:03.850 --> 01:10.993
Jack Youngblood, the fiddle player, doing an old-timer call the 8th of January.

01:10.993 --> 02:10.245
[Music.]

02:10.245 --> 02:11.767
Well, all right there, Jackson.

02:11.787 --> 02:13.008
Thank you a lot there, buddy.

02:13.428 --> 02:16.932
That's what I call real hoedown fiddle playing there.

02:16.952 --> 02:17.272
Yes, sir.

02:17.372 --> 02:20.355
You know, friend, I was just thinking about something.

02:21.717 --> 02:23.439
That is my friend Smokey Bear.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.762
Ain't no Smokey Bear and me are real good friends.

02:27.772 --> 02:31.496
I know a lot of you out there don't quite understand that.

02:31.997 --> 02:35.841
Smokey Bear is really a live bear, a real live bear.

02:36.061 --> 02:37.002
He and I are pals.

02:37.042 --> 02:38.444
We're both in the same boat.

02:39.485 --> 02:43.810
We're both after these forest and woods fires.

02:43.910 --> 02:45.432
We're after them with all four feet.

02:45.532 --> 02:48.715
Friends, we're trying to put them out, stop them.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.677
They're dangerous.

02:49.737 --> 02:50.738
They're wasteful.

02:50.758 --> 02:53.181
They're everything.

02:53.341 --> 02:56.164
I know a lot of you have seen Smokey Bear's pictures.

02:56.184 --> 02:57.205
He's all dressed up,

02:57.961 --> 03:27.023
dungarees, he's got a hat on, and you see him on these picture posters out in the woods and in the bus stations and post offices and around, all over the 
country. Now he's out there on these posters reminding folks to be careful with their matches, cigarettes, campfires, and to use the ashtrays in the car. 
That's just Smokey just like me and i get up here and tell you how to be careful and beg you to be careful and

03:27.239 --> 03:31.104
with your matches and cigarettes, campfires, all that sort of stuff.

03:32.405 --> 03:36.070
And friends, I do want you to know there is a real live Smokey Bear.

03:37.732 --> 03:42.297
Right now, he's up in Washington up there at our capital in the zoo.

03:43.999 --> 03:46.082
And that's his home there.

03:46.122 --> 03:47.083
He lives there.

03:47.103 --> 03:50.768
Of course, now and then, he stops and poses for a few pictures.

03:50.788 --> 03:52.690
He's up there for everybody to see.

03:53.885 --> 03:57.268
And I'd like to tell you how Smokey Bear come to be in the zoo in Washington.

03:58.009 --> 04:03.474
They had an awful fire in New Mexico, and the forestry boys found little Smokey.

04:03.494 --> 04:08.279
He was all that was left alive where these woods had burned over.

04:08.299 --> 04:20.331
The smokes, the old stumps and logs and chunks and things were still smoking, and they heard a pitiful sound over in the edge of the woods there, 
and they went over and looked, and there was poor little Smokey up a sapling there with

04:20.885 --> 04:22.707
About half his hair seems off.

04:22.727 --> 04:29.133
His feet was burned where he'd been running, trying to get out of it in the fire and burned the bottom of his feet.

04:29.153 --> 04:31.274
And the poor little fellow was in bad shape.

04:32.415 --> 04:33.436
So they got him down.

04:34.177 --> 04:42.184
Well, the boys, they took him in and doctored him all up there and tried to save his life.

04:42.244 --> 04:45.888
The state game boys, they gave them permission to keep him, keep Little Smokey.

04:45.928 --> 04:46.468
So they did.

04:46.488 --> 04:49.491
They kept him, took mighty good care of him, and...

04:50.011 --> 04:57.459
Then in turn, they give him to the Washington Zoo out there, where everybody that happens to visit the zoo can go out and see him.

04:57.479 --> 05:01.543
In other words, anybody has got a chance to go see Smokey.

05:01.643 --> 05:05.587
So if you happen to be up in Washington for any reason, go by and see Smokey.

05:05.607 --> 05:07.469
You'll see him for yourself.

05:07.489 --> 05:15.517
I just didn't want people to see Smokey on a poster and think, well, he's just a make-believe bear, because there is a real live Smokey, and he's my buddy.

05:16.098 --> 05:16.799
I'll guarantee you.

05:16.819 --> 05:18.060
Here we'll go with another tune.

05:18.614 --> 05:20.562
I guess I'll try to get through this one, friends.

05:21.828 --> 05:24.258
Don't none of you laugh at me, because it's the best I can do.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.190
It's a little tune called Hang Your Head In Shame.

05:27.190 --> 05:45.887
[Music.]

05:45.887 --> 05:49.498
Well does your conscience ever bother you

05:50.407 --> 06:16.093
every time you hear my name? Try and think of all that I've gone through, and hang your head in shame. Well, someone came along and took my place. 
Then you gave me all the blame. Well, you should go somewhere and hide your face

06:16.816 --> 06:20.317
And hang your head in shame. 

06:20.317 --> 06:38.000
[Music.]

06:38.000 --> 06:46.556
Now when you said I was the only one was it just a little game?

06:46.616 --> 07:09.250
Think of all the harm that you have done, and hang your head in shame. Well, you don't miss me since we've been apart. I wish that I could say the same. 
Think of how you broke my trusting heart,

07:09.871 --> 07:13.175
and hang your head in shame.

07:15.138 --> 07:15.698
Yes, sir.

07:15.718 --> 07:16.659
Thank you, boys.

07:16.679 --> 07:17.000
Thank you.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.025
You know, I ought to dedicate that to all the fellas out there that gets careless and lets the wood burn.

07:21.065 --> 07:21.526
You know that?

07:21.926 --> 07:22.927
Yes, sir, really ought to.

07:23.969 --> 07:26.772
Yeah, that reminds me of carelessness and all that sort of stuff.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.574
Friends, I am just chugged full of stories.

07:28.594 --> 07:30.977
You know, I'm in this thing every day, every day.

07:31.438 --> 07:32.619
And I hear these stories.

07:32.639 --> 07:33.921
Well, I pay attention to them.

07:34.289 --> 07:35.871
because I'm interested in the woods.

07:35.951 --> 07:37.813
I live in the woods, and I want good woods.

07:37.873 --> 07:40.095
I want lots of woods, bigger woods, more woods.

07:40.796 --> 07:42.798
We'll have better hunting, better fishing, everything.

07:43.159 --> 07:53.350
You know, I know of a case where there's a bunch of Girl Scouts, and they had a troop, so they kind of made themselves up a Smokey Bear fan club about my buddy up there, Smokey Bear.

07:54.471 --> 08:04.262
And they were out camping one time, and they went off up the creek on a hike, and they came upon a camp where some fellas had been fishing

08:04.883 --> 08:09.228
And they had made coffee early that morning before they went out fishing.

08:09.248 --> 08:16.576
And they were in such a hurry to get off fishing and all that nobody taking a second thought and they didn't clean around their fire and they left it burning.

08:17.236 --> 08:23.964
Well, these girls come along just in time to catch this fire as it was beginning to spread out through the woods.

08:23.984 --> 08:26.106
So they put the fire out.

08:26.126 --> 08:30.451
They all pitched in there, these girls did, and put the fire out and they dug a ditch around the fire.

08:30.471 --> 08:32.773
Didn't take long and they dug a ditch around the fire.

08:33.134 --> 08:34.215
And then they left a note.

08:34.600 --> 08:40.768
They left a note at these fellas' camp, warning them about this carelessness, you see.

08:41.208 --> 08:45.894
And they told them on this note that Smokey Bear didn't like such a carelessness.

08:46.715 --> 08:50.180
And can you imagine how those fellas felt when they come back?

08:50.620 --> 08:52.943
I bet you they felt whipped down.

08:53.003 --> 08:53.905
I know I would have.

08:53.945 --> 08:56.668
I'd have been so ashamed I couldn't have faced the public again.

08:57.309 --> 09:00.633
I know of another case that happened about little old Smokey.

09:01.094 --> 09:04.438
There was some fellas' camp fishing, and...

09:05.363 --> 09:34.307
It was over the weekend, so when they broke camp and started home on a Sunday afternoon, they stopped at a place on the way in to get a cold drink 
or something, and when they all got out of the car, they looked in the window there, and there was a great big picture poster of Smokey, you know, 
saying stop woods fires, stop forest fires, and all that stuff, and one of these fellas pulled off his hat and started scratching his head, and he said, 
did we put that camp fire dead out before we left there?

09:34.810 --> 09:36.732
Well, all the other fellows, they began to think.

09:36.752 --> 09:38.754
They were looking at Smokey there.

09:39.375 --> 09:43.559
And after a while, they admitted that they didn't remember whether they had or not.

09:43.999 --> 09:48.664
So they didn't do a thing but get in their car, turn around, and go back 20 or 30 miles.

09:49.525 --> 09:57.173
And sure enough, when they got back, the coffee grounds and dishwater, they had poured coffee grounds and dishwater on them, but it hadn't put it completely out.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.474
The fire wasn't dead out.

09:58.534 --> 10:03.940
And when they drove up, the fire had kind of kenneled back up and was beginning to spread out into thick pine needles.

10:05.135 --> 10:06.637
So they got back just in time.

10:06.677 --> 10:08.399
Now, this fire could have been very bad.

10:08.439 --> 10:11.644
They admitted it could have been an awful fire because the wood was dry right then.

10:11.684 --> 10:12.985
It hadn't rained in several weeks.

10:14.007 --> 10:16.250
Yes, sir, friends, you just can't be too careful.

10:16.290 --> 10:21.677
And remember, my buddy and me, Smokey Bear and Jelly Elliott, let's stop wood fires.

10:21.757 --> 10:22.378
Here we go, boys.

10:22.398 --> 10:23.199
Let's go with another.

10:26.259 --> 11:33.728
[Music.]

11:33.728 --> 11:41.755
All right there, boys.

11:41.775 --> 11:42.336
Thank you a lot.

11:42.376 --> 11:42.996
Thank you a lot.

11:43.016 --> 11:46.219
That was, friends, an old steel tune called the Panhandle Rag.

11:46.780 --> 11:48.982
Get a lot of requests for that tune from time to time.

11:50.423 --> 11:54.587
And we're always glad to do it every time we have a chance.

11:55.408 --> 12:00.912
Friends, don't forget about me telling you about Smokey and inviting you to go by at the zoo in Washington and see him.

12:01.753 --> 12:03.735
He's a cute little fella.

12:04.745 --> 12:09.632
He's getting up big now, and he's just about a grown man.

12:10.513 --> 12:12.796
And he really, he's proud of himself.

12:13.217 --> 12:17.903
You can look at him and tell that he's proud them forestry boys saved his neck.

12:17.923 --> 12:22.690
And don't forget, friends, every time you see a picture of Smokey Bear, think about what I'm telling you.

12:22.710 --> 12:23.871
Be careful with your fires.

12:24.612 --> 12:25.393
I know you will.

12:25.413 --> 12:26.475
Friends, we've run out of time.

12:26.655 --> 12:27.797
We've got to go.

12:27.817 --> 12:32.203
Before we go, here's just a little thought I'd like to leave with you from Smokey and me.

12:32.223 --> 12:34.566
Smokey Bear and me, we don't ask for so much.

12:35.457 --> 12:38.320
And it's all for your own very good.

12:38.340 --> 12:41.204
Just be careful with matches, campfires and such.

12:42.004 --> 12:44.968
Keep fire out of the forest and wood.

12:45.028 --> 12:59.524
Well, there it is, friends.

12:59.544 --> 13:00.165
We've got to go.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.785
We've really enjoyed sitting here under the old pine tree visiting with you.

13:06.628 --> 13:08.151
And we like to come your way.

13:08.852 --> 13:10.996
And we like to have you come our way.

13:11.016 --> 13:13.620
You listen to the announcer and he'll let you know when we'll be back.

13:14.001 --> 13:18.007
And we'd love to have you come down and listen to us a while.

13:19.329 --> 13:28.144
Friends, don't forget our program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own state forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service.

13:28.310 --> 13:33.626
with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:33.646 --> 13:40.547
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:40.547 --> 14:35.608
[Music.]

14:35.608 --> 14:49.000
[Silence.]
