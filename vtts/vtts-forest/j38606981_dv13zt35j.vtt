00:13.345 --> 00:23.677
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:24.098 --> 00:25.880
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.582
That was how he got his name.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.063
Hi there, friends.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.686
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:31.706 --> 00:33.589
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:34.209 --> 00:39.976
And just across the trail there are those masters of songs about America's great outdoors.

00:39.996 --> 00:41.698
The Sons of the Pioneers.

00:41.999 --> 00:49.247
Well, Billy, since we're going to be dealing with fire from above in this program, Tommy Doss and the rest of us want to set the stage properly.

00:50.289 --> 00:55.655
Now, let's keep in mind that it was the good Lord who gave us our woods, forests, grass, and shrubs.

00:56.576 --> 01:03.284
It was he who gave us all the natural wealth and beauty that we love so dearly and are trying so hard to protect.

01:05.927 --> 01:10.352
The prairie sun...

01:10.703 --> 01:19.832
Sends down its rays to warm my heart through every day.

01:20.673 --> 01:33.325
The starlight beams that guides my way are just the touch of God's hand.

01:33.926 --> 01:40.052
The scattered pearls of morning blue

01:40.589 --> 01:46.655
The rainbow mist on hills of blue.

01:47.376 --> 01:53.202
The silver veil of moonbeams too.

01:53.862 --> 01:57.246
The touch of God's hand.

01:58.907 --> 02:04.753
The desert breeze that brushed my hair.

02:05.654 --> 02:09.718
The leap that fell from me.

02:09.901 --> 02:24.076
Who knows where the scent of wild flowers in the air is just the touch of God's hand.

02:25.417 --> 02:38.170
The wasteland call that fills the sky, the hum of wild wings sailing by.

02:38.723 --> 03:08.207
The warm earth bed on which I lie Is just the touch of God's hand The desert yields a water pool Where wild things meet their throats to cool And I'm a carefree

03:09.385 --> 03:18.339
Happy fool, I know the touch of God's hand.

03:18.359 --> 03:24.288
The rain that falls, I love so dear.

03:25.209 --> 03:30.938
And joy is mine just living here.

03:31.627 --> 03:37.635
I know God must be standing near.

03:38.396 --> 03:43.463
I felt the touch of his hand.

03:44.985 --> 03:53.697
I felt the touch of God's hand.

03:53.717 --> 03:54.899
Touch of God's hand.

03:55.980 --> 03:58.123
Boys, you certainly did set the stage right.

03:58.627 --> 04:03.612
Because today we're going to talk a little bit about fire that flashes down from the heavens.

04:04.653 --> 04:05.073
Lightning.

04:06.374 --> 04:09.937
In the West, lightning is a major cause of forest fires.

04:10.958 --> 04:14.161
But for the nation as a whole, that just doesn't hold true.

04:15.162 --> 04:20.848
Except for the West, lightning ranks as a very minor cause of forest fires.

04:20.868 --> 04:26.693
But talking about lightning, it's often associated with mountaintops, which reminds me of a little song.

04:28.428 --> 04:58.080
I'll go up on the mountaintop And grow me a patch of kale I'll make me a jug of molasses too For to sweeten up Liza Jane Oh, little Liza, oh, little Liza Jane Oh, little Liza, she died on the train Now come along, sweet Liza Jane Just come along with me We'll go up on that mountaintop Some pleasure's there to see

04:59.123 --> 05:06.033
Oh, little Liza, oh, little Liza Jane, oh, little Liza, she died on the train.

05:07.295 --> 05:11.021
I'll eat when I am hungry and I'll drink when I am dry.

05:12.082 --> 05:18.132
Now, if a tree don't fall on me, I'll live until I die.

05:19.634 --> 05:26.464
Oh, little Liza, oh, little Liza Jane, oh, little Liza, she died on the train.

05:26.798 --> 05:29.821
Oh, little Dizer, oh, little Dizer, Jim.

05:30.802 --> 05:35.726
Oh, little Dizer, she died on the train.

05:35.746 --> 05:38.689
Of course, I'm not going to let a tree fall on me if I can help it.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.612
Don't you let one fall on you either.

05:42.632 --> 05:45.435
But we were talking about lightning-caused forest fires.

05:46.476 --> 05:54.443
You know, the forestry boys, along with weathermen and other scientists, private as well as government, are trying to do something about lightning fires.

05:55.537 --> 05:58.141
In fact, there's a project going on in the western forest.

05:58.602 --> 06:01.406
They call it Operation Skyfire.

06:01.426 --> 06:05.913
They're trying to find out the origin and life history of lightning storms.

06:06.894 --> 06:15.627
They want to know how lightning develops and how it behaves so that one day they can really do something about preventing lightning-caused fires.

06:16.909 --> 06:24.801
I want to tell you a little bit about how they're working at this, but first here's the Sons of the Pioneers expressing in song how they feel about the west.

06:28.949 --> 06:31.936
Lordy, but I'm feeling mighty happy.

06:32.658 --> 06:35.224
Do you wonder why I feel this way?

06:36.227 --> 06:39.094
Everywhere I turn, my eyes are wasted.

06:39.395 --> 06:46.484
And that is why I'm here to say I'm glad I was born in the heart of the West.

06:46.504 --> 06:49.088
The West is in my soul.

06:50.049 --> 06:53.534
I'm glad I'm living where life's at its best.

06:53.554 --> 06:56.157
The best old ranges roll.

06:57.158 --> 07:00.382
I'm up with the lark at the break of each dawn.

07:00.763 --> 07:03.867
I ride till the sun turns gold.

07:04.201 --> 07:25.855
In the sky he always was and he always will because the West is in my soul.

07:39.233 --> 07:45.846
I'm glad I was born in the heart of the West, the West is in my soul.

07:46.888 --> 07:53.361
I'm glad that I'm living where life's at its best, the best old ranger's road.

07:53.881 --> 07:57.325
I'm up with the lark at the break of each dawn.

07:57.685 --> 08:01.470
I ride till the sun turns gold.

08:01.490 --> 08:11.141
In the sky he always was and he always will because the west is in my soul.

08:11.161 --> 08:12.863
Thank you, fellas.

08:12.883 --> 08:13.664
Now, where were we?

08:14.525 --> 08:15.306
Oh, yes.

08:15.326 --> 08:16.467
Operation Skyfire.

08:17.448 --> 08:19.230
This is an interesting project, all right.

08:20.105 --> 08:30.056
As I've said, the foresters are in it, and cooperating with them are scientists from several universities, private research foundations, and other government agencies.

08:30.076 --> 08:34.782
They've got a mobile laboratory that can scoot from one area to another during the lightning season.

08:35.683 --> 08:48.137
And they're making cloud surveys from a number of fire lookouts with the forest guards who are stationed on the towers, making notes on clouds and cloud formations, how they form and how fast they move and things like that.

08:48.978 --> 08:50.120
It's a great work, all right.

08:50.941 --> 08:55.807
And I hope the boys are successful in finding out the answers to these lightning fires in the West.

08:57.129 --> 08:58.471
How do you feel about that, Lloyd?

08:58.851 --> 09:04.259
Yes, I'm sure glad studies are going on to try to cut down on lightning fires.

09:04.279 --> 09:14.252
Now, the average American can't do much about lightning, of course, but he... Oh, no, but he can sure do something about the matches and the smokes and his outside fires.

09:14.272 --> 09:15.694
Like I've always said, Lloyd...

09:16.096 --> 09:23.806
The fellow who ain't careful how he handles fire while he's still alive may have his hands full of it when he's dead.

09:23.846 --> 09:25.568
Say, you sound like a preacher, you.

09:26.009 --> 09:28.332
Well, we can't have enough of this kind of preachment.

09:28.612 --> 09:29.113
No, sir.

09:29.894 --> 09:35.261
Let's get right with ourselves and live a good, clean life when it comes to being careful with fire.

09:35.942 --> 09:40.949
Now I tell you... All right, boys, let's go to the camp meeting.

09:40.969 --> 09:42.711
I saw...

09:45.880 --> 10:04.834
And I got the word I know that it's right And have you heard?

10:05.371 --> 10:11.420
I'm going to ride the cowboy camp.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.663
Ride the cowboy camp.

10:13.683 --> 10:15.546
Ride the cowboy camp.

10:15.806 --> 10:18.490
Ride on the golden range up in the sky.

10:18.510 --> 10:21.555
Up in the sky, way up in the sky.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.718
Yes, we'll ride the cowboy camp.

10:23.738 --> 10:25.981
Yes, sir, way up in the sky.

10:26.041 --> 10:30.248
Brother Buffalo Bell and Sister Lou is going to beat our brother like me and you.

10:30.328 --> 10:33.893
And old Miss Carson, he will too, way up in the sky.

10:36.202 --> 10:43.516
Right on the golden range up in the sky.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.662
Way up in the sky, way up in the sky.

10:46.682 --> 10:50.850
Yes, we're riding cowboy, can't be swept in the sky.

10:51.150 --> 10:55.799
Little David slew that johnson tall, proved right with mud for big and small.

10:55.819 --> 10:58.885
He'll play as far as I recall, way up in the sky.

10:58.925 --> 10:59.526
He's gonna play.

10:59.506 --> 11:26.323
Play, cowboy, can't meet him Play, cowboy, can't meet him Play, cowboy, can't meet him Play on the golden harp up in the sky Up in the sky, up in the sky Yes, we're clear to cowboy, can't meet him Way up in the sky, cowboy Way up in the sky, cowboy, can't meet him Way up in the sky Always

11:29.375 --> 11:41.311
Up in the way, up in the sky.

11:44.916 --> 11:47.240
Cowboy camp meeting.

11:47.260 --> 11:52.667
That's sure the place where a fella can get up on his feet and make a strong point or two for a good cause.

11:53.628 --> 11:56.192
Now, Brother Farr, you were going strong there.

11:56.628 --> 12:00.735
But here's a fella coming up the trail now who might give you a good run for your money.

12:01.557 --> 12:06.005
He's got his ranger's hat and shovel, and he's all togged out as usual in dungarees.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.051
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

12:09.692 --> 12:15.663
He's the popular candidate, the people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:15.683 --> 12:18.147
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for him.

12:18.734 --> 12:20.878
Hello there, folks.

12:20.898 --> 12:28.191
If you give me your support, I promise you we can put a real dent in nine out of every ten forest fires.

12:28.512 --> 12:35.425
You see, for the country as a whole, that's how many fires each year are man-caused, mostly through carelessness.

12:35.705 --> 12:37.148
Nine out of ten.

12:37.550 --> 12:42.457
How about backing me up in preventing man-caused forest fires?

12:42.477 --> 12:43.599
Here's how.

12:43.619 --> 12:48.285
Be careful with your matches, your smokes, and with outdoor fires.

12:48.305 --> 12:55.956
We can't prevent lightning fires, you and I, but we can sure strike at those that are man-caused.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.061
Well, I'll be seeing you.

12:59.081 --> 13:00.623
And there he goes down the trail.

13:01.564 --> 13:02.646
Thank you, Smokey.

13:04.364 --> 13:08.128
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:09.369 --> 13:12.072
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:12.753 --> 13:23.264
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:23.284 --> 13:30.912
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman and those masters of outdoor songs.

13:31.195 --> 13:36.064
The Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:36.665 --> 13:42.314
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:42.335 --> 13:46.622
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

13:46.822 --> 14:04.830
Growlin' and a-growlin' and a-stiffin' the air He can find the fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear

14:04.810 --> 14:18.668
Crowlin' and a-growlin' and a-stiffin' the air He can find the fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name

14:28.402 --> 14:35.374
Oh.
