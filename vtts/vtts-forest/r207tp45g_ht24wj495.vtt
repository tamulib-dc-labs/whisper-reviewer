00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
[Silence.]

00:15.000 --> 00:23.897
[Music.]

00:23.897 --> 00:26.487
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:26.867 --> 00:28.610
That's why they called him Smokey.

00:28.650 --> 00:30.412
That was how we got his name.

00:30.893 --> 00:31.874
Hi there, friends.

00:32.034 --> 00:34.738
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:34.758 --> 00:37.942
Glad you could come this way up the trail again today.

00:37.962 --> 00:43.910
So how about having the same old seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:43.930 --> 00:45.732
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:46.488 --> 00:49.451
That's because we kept fires from running wild through here.

00:50.612 --> 00:56.538
Well, sir, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:56.558 --> 01:00.581
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there.

01:00.601 --> 01:01.863
The sons of the pioneers.

01:02.303 --> 01:04.545
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail, too.

01:04.645 --> 01:10.691
And now that you're here and comfortably settled, they're going to start off this little outdoor get-together of ours.

01:10.931 --> 01:14.475
So just relax and let's hear some mighty fine singing.

01:14.495 --> 01:14.875
Huh?

01:19.664 --> 01:27.498
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did right, uh-huh.

01:27.518 --> 01:35.833
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did right, a sword and pistol by his side, uh-huh.

01:44.133 --> 01:48.080
And he rode up to Mrs. Mouse's door, uh-huh.

01:50.083 --> 02:00.842
He rode up to Mrs. Mouse's door and he knocked so hard that he made it roar, uh-huh.

02:08.720 --> 02:14.868
Oh, he took Mrs. Mousy on his knee, uh-huh.

02:14.968 --> 02:19.755
He took Mrs. Mousy on his knee, uh-huh.

02:20.436 --> 02:32.432
He said, Mrs. Mousy, won't you marry me? Uh-huh.

02:32.935 --> 02:38.963
And now before I can answer that, uh-huh.

02:41.006 --> 02:48.315
Now just before I can answer that, I'll have to see my Uncle Rat, uh-huh.

02:57.185 --> 03:00.850
Now what will the wedding supper be? Uh-huh.

03:05.276 --> 03:08.160
What will the wedding supper be?

03:08.961 --> 03:12.005
Two blue beans and a black-eyed pea, uh-huh.

03:21.298 --> 03:25.704
Now a little piece of cornbread lying on the ship, uh-huh.

03:29.163 --> 03:32.609
A little piece of cornbread lying on the shelf, uh-huh.

03:32.889 --> 03:40.757
If you want any more, just sing it yourself, cause I'm tired, uh-huh.

03:50.519 --> 03:52.482
Froggy with a courtin'.

03:52.502 --> 03:54.225
That's a real fine song, isn't it?

03:55.218 --> 04:05.032
Now, today for this last get-together, friends, that you're having for a while under the old pine tree, we want to salute all of Smokey Bear's junior forest rangers.

04:05.894 --> 04:09.960
You know, they're the boys and girls who are helping Smokey prevent forest fires.

04:10.921 --> 04:17.311
They're on Smokey's team, and they've got a special certificate and a membership card to prove it.

04:17.331 --> 04:22.218
Now, all of these junior forest rangers have to take a pledge, which I think everyone ought to take.

04:22.859 --> 04:23.740
It goes like this.

04:24.344 --> 04:38.199
I give my pledge as an American to save and faithfully to defend from waste the natural resources of my country, its soil and minerals, its forests, waters, and wildlife.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.783
Those words are full of meaning, aren't they, friend?

04:42.884 --> 04:53.035
And when the boys and girls have taken that conservation pledge and have become members of Smokey Bear's Junior Forest Rangers Club, they go to work preventing forest fires.

04:53.639 --> 04:56.925
And what a wonderful job they're doing.

04:56.945 --> 04:59.971
I know, because Smokey Bear has told me so.

04:59.991 --> 05:02.316
And I've got some further proof, too.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.919
But we'll get into that a little bit later.

05:04.460 --> 05:08.788
Right now, would you like to hear about the adventures of a little friend of mine?

05:08.808 --> 05:10.652
He's Guffy the Goofy Goblin.

05:11.189 --> 05:39.610
Guppy the Goofy Gobbler was silly as a clown. He'd come in for breakfast when the sun was going down. All of the other turkeys would use his feeding tray And if he just came near it, they'd chase him right away. But Guppy didn't mind at all when he kept getting thinner

05:40.096 --> 05:45.686
For when Thanksgiving came, they picked the fat ones out for dinner.

05:46.186 --> 05:51.956
So Guffy, the goofy gobbler, should really get three cheers.

05:51.976 --> 05:57.826
Now just let him stay goofy, and he'll live a hundred years.

05:57.846 --> 06:03.015
But Guffy didn't mind at all when he kept getting thinner.

06:03.451 --> 06:08.696
For when Thanksgiving came, they picked the fat ones out for dinner.

06:09.397 --> 06:15.283
So Guffey, the goofy gobbler, should really get three cheers.

06:15.303 --> 06:20.929
Now just let him stay goofy, and he'll live a hundred years.

06:23.712 --> 06:24.153
Yes, sir.

06:24.773 --> 06:27.016
He might live to be a hundred years old.

06:27.436 --> 06:29.338
Of course, that's doing it the hard way, you know.

06:29.959 --> 06:31.180
Starving himself to death.

06:32.695 --> 06:38.081
But we were talking about Smokey's Junior Forest Rangers and the good work they're doing.

06:38.922 --> 06:43.168
For instance, a mother of two children in Albuquerque, New Mexico, had this to say.

06:44.129 --> 06:51.658
Since our children have become Junior Forest Rangers, they keep sharp eyes on their father's and my cigarettes on our many camping trips.

06:52.739 --> 06:55.683
Consequently, we parents have grown more careful ourselves.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.188
And from Modesto, California, came this word from another mother.

07:01.079 --> 07:05.546
It's amazing how much more alert children are than grown-ups.

07:05.566 --> 07:10.454
Since Scotty promised to help Smokey, there never is a cigarette thrown from our car anymore.

07:11.195 --> 07:13.359
We really get told.

07:13.379 --> 07:14.861
Of course, the fathers are in this, too.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.807
I have this report from one in Ohio, and here's what he says.

07:19.749 --> 07:26.239
The other day, just as we started on a drive, I saw my youngster run to the car and try to remove the ashtray.

07:27.361 --> 07:28.723
I asked him what he was doing, and he

07:28.940 --> 07:36.651
told me that if I was going to use that ashtray, he was going to make sure that it was clean so there would be enough room to put cigarettes.

07:36.671 --> 07:43.722
He told me he didn't want me to have to empty it on the road and possibly start a fire with the hot ashes.

07:43.742 --> 07:49.530
And here's a case, friends, where a whole school of children have pledged their support to Smokey.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.714
They wanted Smokey to visit them.

07:51.734 --> 07:54.978
They said they were Smokey's friends and helpers.

07:54.998 --> 07:58.103
As they put it, they wanted to feel a bear like Smokey.

07:59.416 --> 08:02.219
You see, friends, they are youngsters who are blind.

08:04.061 --> 08:08.647
And isn't there a wonderful lesson in all of this for us grown-ups?

08:08.667 --> 08:18.258
It looks like with the children showing us the way, we ought to pitch in and help them help Smokey do his job of preventing forest and woods fires.

08:18.858 --> 08:28.309
You know, Billy, we've had a lot of requests from the good people listening to these forest fire prevention shows to do Smokey the Bear all the way through, and that's just what we're going to do right now.

08:29.015 --> 08:36.154
We'd like every one of Smokey's Junior Forest Rangers and their moms and dads, too, to know that we're doing this especially for them.

08:36.635 --> 08:38.119
Golly, that's fine, fellas.

08:38.580 --> 08:39.122
Let's hear it.

08:44.253 --> 08:52.587
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

08:53.208 --> 09:01.542
He can find a fire before it starts to flame, that's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

09:01.843 --> 09:10.277
With a ranger's hat and shovel and a pair of dungarees, you will find him in the forest always sniffin' at the breeze.

09:10.679 --> 09:19.358
People stop and pay attention when he tells them to beware, cause everybody knows that he's the fire preventin' bear.

09:19.899 --> 09:28.418
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

09:28.398 --> 09:33.087
I can find a fire before it starts to flame.

09:33.147 --> 09:37.115
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

09:37.135 --> 09:41.804
Yeah, that's why they call me Smokey, and that's how I got my name.

09:42.224 --> 09:46.272
You can take a tip from Smokey that there's nothing like a tree.

09:46.589 --> 09:50.755
Cause they're good for kids to climb in and they're beautiful to see.

09:51.196 --> 09:59.708
You just have to look around you and you'll find it's not a joke to see what you'd be missing if they all went up and smoked.

10:00.309 --> 10:09.002
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

10:09.067 --> 10:13.232
Well, I can find a fire before it starts to flame.

10:13.672 --> 10:17.817
Ooh, that's why they called him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

10:17.957 --> 10:22.902
Yeah, that's why they called me Smokey, and that's how I got my name.

10:22.922 --> 10:26.907
You can camp up on his doorstep, and he'll make you feel at home.

10:27.427 --> 10:31.632
You can run and hunt and ramble anywhere you care to roam.

10:31.898 --> 10:36.308
He will let you take his honey and pretend he's not so smart.

10:36.689 --> 10:41.359
But don't you harm the trees, for he's a ranger in his heart.

10:41.379 --> 10:49.958
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

10:50.258 --> 10:54.388
I can find a fire before it starts to flame.

10:54.909 --> 10:58.919
That's why they called him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

10:59.099 --> 11:03.671
Yeah, that's why they called me Smokey and that's how I got my name.

11:04.132 --> 11:08.402
If you've ever seen the forest when a fire is running wild.

11:08.382 --> 11:12.750
And you love the things within it like a mother loves her child.

11:13.131 --> 11:17.319
Then you know why Smokey tells you when he sees you passing through.

11:17.780 --> 11:21.668
Remember, please be careful, it's the least that you can do.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.577
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

11:26.843 --> 11:30.947
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

11:31.587 --> 11:35.651
Why, I can find a fire before it starts to flame.

11:35.671 --> 11:39.934
Ooh, that's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

11:40.115 --> 11:48.162
Yeah, that's why they call me Smokey, and that's how I got my name.

11:48.182 --> 11:55.348
And here he is, comin' up the trail now, big as life, Smokey Bear, with a special message for just about everybody.

11:55.598 --> 11:57.021
Big and little alike.

11:57.923 --> 12:00.668
Hello there, folks.

12:00.688 --> 12:04.515
I guess I'm just about the luckiest bear that ever lived.

12:04.916 --> 12:16.138
Of course, I'm thinking about all the friends I've got and my wonderful helpers, the junior forest rangers, with their mothers and dads pitching in, too.

12:16.490 --> 12:26.946
I know the junior forest rangers are going to help me put an end to these stupid and unnecessary forest, woods, and range fires some fine day.

12:27.687 --> 12:28.869
That's what it's going to take.

12:29.570 --> 12:37.902
Every one of us working together to stop forest fires before they get started by being careful all the time.

12:38.844 --> 12:45.754
You've got to remember always that only you can prevent forest fires.

12:46.544 --> 12:49.328
Well, I'll be seen.

12:51.010 --> 12:52.892
And there he goes down the trail.

12:53.413 --> 12:54.354
Thank you, Smokey.

12:55.896 --> 12:59.581
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:00.562 --> 13:05.368
Thanks a lot for joining us in these little outdoor get-togethers under the old pine tree.

13:06.369 --> 13:16.382
You know, it's been your own State Forestry Department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that have made these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:17.240 --> 13:23.525
Until some fine day when we may say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:24.226 --> 13:29.370
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:30.571 --> 13:41.881
Well, so long for a while from Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and from those wonderful fellas who sing your favorite songs of the outdoors the way you like to hear them, the sons of the pioneers.

13:42.562 --> 13:46.605
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear,

13:46.872 --> 14:04.206
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air. He can find a fire before it starts to flame. That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name. Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear

14:04.355 --> 14:21.570
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air. He can find a fire before it starts to flame. That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name. Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear

14:21.888 --> 14:39.255
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air. He can find a fire before it starts to flame. That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name. Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear

14:39.235 --> 14:52.333
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air. He can find a fire before it starts to flame. That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.
