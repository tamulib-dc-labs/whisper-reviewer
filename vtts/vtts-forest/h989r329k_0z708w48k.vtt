00:12.738 --> 00:19.385
Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:25.752 --> 00:32.680
Today we present the fifth in our series on forest conservation, featuring Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:34.182 --> 00:36.464
Our scene is Beaver Dam Forest.

00:36.484 --> 00:41.530
Here in this thriving forest community, there is an exciting, unending struggle for existence.

00:41.881 --> 00:46.850
Plants and animals compete among themselves against each other for life and supremacy.

00:47.612 --> 00:57.170
It's the job of Ranger Bill Scott to referee this competition, to handle the forest in such a way that there is truly survival of the fittest among the plants and animals.

00:57.811 --> 01:03.822
The ranger's job is one of service to the forest itself, to his fellow citizens who reap the forest's wealth.

01:04.814 --> 01:13.165
As our story opens, we find our young friends, Joe and Sam, hiking down a pretty woods road deep within the Beaver Dam Wildlife Management Area.

01:13.185 --> 01:20.635
They're on their way to keep an appointment with Ranger Bill and his niece, June, following a rather mysterious telephone call from the ranger.

01:21.496 --> 01:30.147
As they rapidly stride along, Joe, who talked with Ranger Bill, is besieged with questions by Sam, who is very curious about that phone call.

01:30.852 --> 01:33.539
Golly, Joe, is that all Ranger Bill said?

01:33.559 --> 01:35.604
Just that we should meet him at the Black Hawk Trail?

01:35.965 --> 01:36.527
Nothing else?

01:36.948 --> 01:39.875
Well, what about Smokey, that little bear cub we found in the cave?

01:40.437 --> 01:42.803
Ranger Bill was gonna take us to see Smokey today.

01:42.823 --> 01:43.905
Oh, I can't seem to remember.

01:44.407 --> 01:46.853
Ranger Bill spoke pretty fast, and he said...

01:46.833 --> 01:47.634
Hey, wait a minute.

01:48.174 --> 01:50.476
There's Ranger Bill off the road there at the end of the woods.

01:50.857 --> 01:51.817
Yeah, I see him.

01:51.838 --> 01:52.838
June is with him.

01:52.858 --> 01:53.879
Hello there, Ranger Bill.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.020
Hi, June.

01:55.120 --> 01:55.561
Hello, boys.

01:55.581 --> 01:56.602
What's up, Ranger Bill?

01:56.902 --> 01:57.943
What are we meeting here for?

01:57.983 --> 02:00.225
We thought you'd let us visit Smokey today, Ranger Bill.

02:00.265 --> 02:00.705
Where is he?

02:00.726 --> 02:01.266
Can we see him?

02:01.326 --> 02:01.947
No, no, no.

02:01.967 --> 02:03.228
One question at a time, boys.

02:03.928 --> 02:07.812
Well, it looks as though Smokey just wasn't anchoring to see any visitors today.

02:07.832 --> 02:09.553
Well, what do you mean by that, Ranger Bill?

02:09.573 --> 02:10.715
He's gone, Sam.

02:11.095 --> 02:11.715
Smokey's gone.

02:11.916 --> 02:12.016
Gone?

02:12.036 --> 02:12.937
Gone where?

02:12.957 --> 02:16.840
Well, a little rascal broke out of his wire pen at the game warden station early this morning.

02:16.820 --> 02:19.424
And he was last seen heading in this direction.

02:19.444 --> 02:20.806
That's why I asked you to meet me here.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.067
Well, what are we waiting for?

02:22.448 --> 02:23.710
Let's get going and find Smokey.

02:23.730 --> 02:24.010
Sure.

02:24.330 --> 02:26.253
He can't get very far, can he, Ranger Bill?

02:26.333 --> 02:27.435
With that broken leg of his.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.499
Well, happy to say that Smokey's leg wasn't broken after all, Sam.

02:30.839 --> 02:32.422
Just a pretty bad spring.

02:32.442 --> 02:37.268
Bad enough, though, that he still ought to be taking it easy a while and not go wandering off through the woods.

02:37.288 --> 02:38.430
You mean he's not strong enough.

02:38.710 --> 02:39.612
Is that it, Uncle Bill?

02:39.672 --> 02:40.232
Yes, June.

02:40.693 --> 02:43.537
Don't forget, Smokey can't do much more than just hobble along.

02:43.717 --> 02:45.780
He's favoring that bagged leg of his, you see.

02:46.199 --> 02:51.712
But without protection by a mother bear, he's liable to be hurt by a big wildcat, maybe, or some other animal.

02:51.732 --> 02:53.717
Oh, that would be terrible, Uncle Bill.

02:53.777 --> 02:54.278
I'll say.

02:54.860 --> 02:55.822
What about some hunter?

02:55.982 --> 03:00.934
Yes, I don't doubt that some thoughtless hunter might take a shot at Smokey for the little bearskin he'd get off him.

03:01.420 --> 03:03.545
But let's not worry about that, huh, Sam?

03:03.565 --> 03:06.592
I think maybe we can find Smokey before any harm comes to him.

03:06.692 --> 03:07.674
Golly, I hope so.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.378
Come here, the three of you.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.563
Now look down here on that soft dirt on the trail.

03:12.004 --> 03:12.485
What do you see?

03:12.726 --> 03:16.014
Well, it looks as though some barefooted kid put his foot down right there.

03:16.354 --> 03:18.700
No, it's more like a handprint, Uncle Bill.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.682
Hey, wait a minute.

03:19.662 --> 03:21.525
That's Smokey's track, isn't it, Ranger Bill?

03:21.685 --> 03:23.267
Well, each of you is right in the way.

03:23.548 --> 03:27.233
That is Smokey's footprint, though it does look a bit like a youngster's foot or hand.

03:27.253 --> 03:28.896
There's another one just ahead there.

03:28.916 --> 03:31.660
Well, then, let's just roll along and stop worrying, huh?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.002
I'm still on this trail, Ranger Bill.

03:33.342 --> 03:34.704
Smokey's tracks roll along here.

03:34.744 --> 03:35.505
Good boy, Joe.

03:35.565 --> 03:36.046
Stay with him.

03:36.246 --> 03:37.028
We're right behind you.

03:37.188 --> 03:37.749
Ranger Bill.

03:38.149 --> 03:38.650
Yes, Sam.

03:38.984 --> 03:43.052
Why do you call this part of Beaver Dam Forest the wildlife area?

03:43.072 --> 03:45.538
Isn't the whole forest one big wildlife area, really?

03:45.798 --> 03:47.081
Well, that's a good question, Sam.

03:47.702 --> 03:55.879
I guess I can best answer it by saying that this particular section of Beaver Dam Forest is the center of our wildlife management activities.

03:56.163 --> 04:08.243
Now, we picked this as the wildlife area because, well, because conditions here are what you might call ideal for protecting and maintaining our wildlife population, the animals, birds, and fish.

04:08.423 --> 04:11.008
What do you mean by ideal conditions, Uncle Bill?

04:11.028 --> 04:11.669
Just a minute, June.

04:11.929 --> 04:13.692
Joe, can you still see Smokey's tracks?

04:13.712 --> 04:14.413
Yes, sir.

04:14.433 --> 04:17.058
We're in his trail, all right, and I'm listening to what you're saying, too.

04:17.258 --> 04:19.882
Well, keep a sharp eye on him just the same.

04:19.902 --> 04:21.445
Now, June, to answer your question...

04:21.998 --> 04:24.742
All wild things need food and cover.

04:24.762 --> 04:26.384
That's a place to hide and live.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.188
And we have that fine combination right here.

04:29.448 --> 04:32.172
I've been noticing how thick the trees are growing all along here.

04:32.793 --> 04:35.897
I suppose the animals can hide in these woods and be safe from their enemies.

04:35.917 --> 04:36.518
Huh, Ranger Bill?

04:36.718 --> 04:37.259
Yeah, that's it.

04:37.679 --> 04:42.446
Then, too, there are little openings here and there where the weeds, berries, and the grasses grow.

04:43.026 --> 04:46.271
And that happens to be the best feeding places for the animals.

04:46.291 --> 04:51.718
Such as lots of tender maple and willow shoots for the deer to eat and thick trees and brambles for cover.

04:52.154 --> 04:56.602
Aspen trees for the beaver to feed on and plenty of wood that they can use to build their homes.

04:57.544 --> 05:03.054
And fine, clear, running streams that the animals and birds can drink from and the fish can live in.

05:03.074 --> 05:04.296
How is the fishing here, Ranger?

05:04.376 --> 05:06.440
Mighty good, Sam, mighty good.

05:06.460 --> 05:11.489
But that's only because we take good care of the whole watershed in this wildlife area.

05:11.509 --> 05:14.314
Now, we sell timber that should be cut, of course.

05:14.716 --> 05:22.704
but we never forget for a moment that we're also growing deer, squirrels, beaver, fish, and other wildlife, as well as the trees in this area.

05:22.724 --> 05:26.348
Now I know what you mean, Uncle Bill, when you talk about wildlife management.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.650
It all adds up to this, June.

05:28.190 --> 05:34.157
We try to maintain a balance between the food in the forest and the number of animals that have to live on that food.

05:34.817 --> 05:41.204
Now, if there are too many animals, the food runs out, the forest is damaged, and the animals may even starve.

05:41.404 --> 05:43.346
What do you do in a case like that, Ranger Bill?

05:43.386 --> 05:43.947
Well, Sam...

05:44.602 --> 05:49.447
When something like that happens, we arrange what we call regulated hunts in the wildlife area.

05:50.107 --> 05:53.531
And we hold those hunts in cooperation with the local game officials.

05:53.551 --> 05:53.911
Sure.

05:54.311 --> 05:57.655
That way there's enough food to go around and the herd stays healthy and happy.

05:57.775 --> 05:58.615
Exactly, Sam.

05:58.736 --> 05:59.436
Uncle Bill?

05:59.456 --> 05:59.897
Yes, June?

06:00.117 --> 06:03.080
There's no regulated hunt going on right now, though, is there?

06:03.100 --> 06:05.242
Still worrying about Smokey, hmm?

06:05.262 --> 06:08.585
No, child, any hunting that may be going on in here now would be illegal.

06:09.045 --> 06:12.769
And we don't tolerate hunting that isn't supervised or that's out of season.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.724
Uncle Bill, did you hear that?

06:14.744 --> 06:16.928
Yes, June, I did.

06:16.948 --> 06:18.010
That sounds like a horse.

06:18.070 --> 06:18.972
Now, you're back, Sam.

06:19.252 --> 06:21.156
What would a horse be doing right out here in the woods?

06:21.436 --> 06:24.702
Well, suppose we walk over there where that sound's coming from and find out, huh?

06:24.722 --> 06:26.305
Well, what about Smokey, Uncle Bill?

06:26.325 --> 06:27.808
Oh, we won't take but a few minutes, June.

06:28.329 --> 06:31.956
I think you'll all be interested in what we find out there a little bit.

06:32.611 --> 06:34.894
Why, it is a horse.

06:34.914 --> 06:36.396
A beautiful old horse.

06:36.417 --> 06:37.238
Look at her come.

06:37.478 --> 06:38.580
She knows you, Ranger Bill.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.561
She won't dump this thing.

06:39.661 --> 06:40.242
Will she, Ranger Bill?

06:40.262 --> 06:41.464
No, Joe, just stand still.

06:41.844 --> 06:44.448
Old Daisy's coming over to pay her respects to us.

06:45.369 --> 06:47.633
Ah, good girl.

06:47.933 --> 06:48.835
Good old Daisy.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.577
Glad to see me, huh, lady?

06:50.597 --> 06:51.138
Oh, look.

06:51.418 --> 06:52.880
She's shaking her head up and down.

06:53.241 --> 06:55.284
Why, she's rubbing her nose against you, Uncle Bill.

06:55.304 --> 06:55.785
Good girl.

06:56.305 --> 06:57.727
How about some sugar, hmm?

06:57.747 --> 06:59.069
There you are, Daisy.

06:59.089 --> 07:00.572
Oh, sorry, it's the loose kind, lady.

07:00.932 --> 07:02.314
Couldn't get any lump sugar today.

07:02.648 --> 07:08.637
Why, Uncle Bill, you must have known you were coming to this spot today, carrying that sugar in your pocket and all.

07:08.657 --> 07:09.639
Of course I did, June.

07:09.939 --> 07:11.301
Whose horse is this, Ranger Bill?

07:11.341 --> 07:13.304
Yeah, and what's it doing out here in the forest?

07:13.404 --> 07:14.867
Well, Daisy's my horse, Sam.

07:15.347 --> 07:18.873
And she's out here because she loves the forest just about as much as we do.

07:19.093 --> 07:20.956
You used to ride a Ranger Bill, is that it?

07:21.216 --> 07:26.625
Well, before I got my truck, Joe, I used Daisy to get around to my jobs in the forest.

07:26.645 --> 07:28.808
But I haven't ridden Daisy for some years now.

07:29.092 --> 07:29.793
Her work's over.

07:30.434 --> 07:31.135
She's retired.

07:31.435 --> 07:32.036
Oh, I get it.

07:32.517 --> 07:35.180
Daisy's living a life of ease now.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.743
Well, that's it, Sam.

07:36.763 --> 07:38.685
She's really earned her rest, I can tell you that.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.848
But why do you keep her penned up, Ranger Bill?

07:41.129 --> 07:43.271
Wouldn't she have more fun just roaming through the forest?

07:43.612 --> 07:44.934
I don't think so, Joe.

07:45.675 --> 07:50.161
No, she's happiest right here in this fine pasture we've fenced off and fixed specially for her.

07:50.441 --> 07:51.643
Right, Daisy?

07:51.663 --> 07:56.770
Now, there's good food here, and that little shelter over there keeps her dry and warm and safe during storms.

07:57.037 --> 08:01.282
Daisy has a food and cover, Uncle Bill, just as you told us the wild animals need.

08:01.422 --> 08:02.884
Yes, June, that's it.

08:02.904 --> 08:06.788
Wild animals and domestic animals, too, like cattle, sheep, and the rest.

08:07.189 --> 08:11.273
Well, they all need food and cover, just as we human beings do.

08:11.293 --> 08:15.118
But to get back to what Joe said... You mean about letting Daisy roam the woods?

08:15.138 --> 08:15.318
Uh-huh.

08:15.698 --> 08:16.920
Oh, I take it back, Ranger Bill.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.182
A good pasture is the place for Daisy.

08:19.563 --> 08:23.447
Well, that's fine, but I wish a lot of farmers and ranchers would see the light, too, Joe.

08:24.749 --> 08:25.930
Look, let me put it this way.

08:26.635 --> 08:29.460
Cows in particular make mighty poor foresters.

08:30.062 --> 08:34.731
No, they trample and nibble young broadleaved trees and keep them from growing.

08:34.751 --> 08:37.636
You see, cows should really be fenced out to keep the woodland growing.

08:38.257 --> 08:40.882
But on the other hand, woodlands make poor pastures too.

08:41.504 --> 08:44.830
You know, one acre of improved pasture like this one of Daisy's

08:45.130 --> 08:50.616
It's worth anywheres from 5 to 25 acres of pasture in the woods all around us.

08:50.736 --> 08:55.361
But what about the cattle on the western ranges, where we get most of our meat and leather from, Rangers?

08:55.441 --> 08:56.782
Well, that's a little different, Sam.

08:57.543 --> 09:01.006
What you've got there are large areas of grasslands throughout the forest.

09:01.707 --> 09:09.856
And there's a balance between food and the number of animals on the land that should be maintained, as we try to do with wildlife in the forest.

09:09.876 --> 09:12.218
But you see, overgrazing doesn't pay anyway.

09:12.704 --> 09:13.986
Oh, Uncle Bill.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.768
Wasn't that a gunshot?

09:15.788 --> 09:16.709
Hey, there it goes again.

09:17.130 --> 09:18.431
Oh, Smokey, Uncle Bill.

09:18.451 --> 09:20.113
Somebody shot Smokey.

09:20.153 --> 09:21.295
I hope not, June.

09:21.315 --> 09:22.456
We'd better get back on the trail.

09:22.496 --> 09:22.917
Come on.

09:23.177 --> 09:23.698
Come on.

09:23.718 --> 09:24.299
Let's hurry.

09:26.441 --> 09:33.170
Oh, if anybody hurts Smokey.

09:33.190 --> 09:35.493
If anybody hurts Smokey, I'll... All right, all right.

09:35.713 --> 09:36.454
Now, let's slow down.

09:36.474 --> 09:38.256
We're getting close to where those shots came from.

09:40.396 --> 09:41.738
June, don't look so excited.

09:41.758 --> 09:43.280
Just take it easy.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.241
Yeah.

09:44.681 --> 09:45.743
June's right, Ranger Bill.

09:46.324 --> 09:50.549
Anybody that would shoot a crippled little bear ought to be... Well, he ought to be shot himself.

09:50.889 --> 09:51.470
Quiet, all of you.

09:51.490 --> 09:52.411
What is it, Ranger Bill?

09:52.551 --> 09:54.093
Quick now, get behind this big tree here.

09:54.113 --> 09:54.314
Hurry.

09:55.435 --> 09:56.677
Oh, why is Smokey?

09:56.817 --> 09:58.719
Oh, he's all right, Uncle Bill.

09:58.819 --> 09:59.620
He's all right.

09:59.641 --> 10:00.782
Golly, look at him come, will you?

10:01.223 --> 10:03.806
And you said he couldn't make good time on three legs, Ranger Bill.

10:03.846 --> 10:04.727
He's scared, Sam.

10:04.787 --> 10:05.408
Good and scared.

10:05.808 --> 10:07.170
We can't keep that pace up long.

10:07.190 --> 10:07.731
What do we do?

10:07.911 --> 10:08.772
He's almost up to us.

10:08.872 --> 10:10.234
Look, he stopped.

10:10.349 --> 10:11.651
He's looking back.

10:11.671 --> 10:13.574
Oh, the poor little frightened thing.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.437
Hey, what is he doing that for, Ranger Bill?

10:15.978 --> 10:18.982
Licking his nose that way and running his paw over his face.

10:19.323 --> 10:20.505
Oh, that little rascal.

10:21.366 --> 10:22.428
I believe I know why.

10:22.728 --> 10:23.409
No, but wait a minute.

10:23.429 --> 10:24.691
Let me get my jacket off.

10:24.872 --> 10:26.214
He started up again, Ranger Bill.

10:26.374 --> 10:27.616
He's traveling slower, though.

10:27.636 --> 10:28.217
Here he comes.

10:28.477 --> 10:29.258
Get him, Ranger Bill.

10:29.318 --> 10:29.739
Get him.

10:31.382 --> 10:33.365
Oh, you got him, Uncle Bill.

10:33.385 --> 10:34.386
Don't hurt him.

10:34.406 --> 10:35.568
Please don't hurt him.

10:35.588 --> 10:36.169
I won't do.

10:36.249 --> 10:36.830
Now, don't worry.

10:37.391 --> 10:38.112
All right, fella.

10:38.345 --> 10:40.208
Come on, let me get this jacket off your head, Smokey.

10:41.490 --> 10:43.112
You ought to be getting used to this by now.

10:43.894 --> 10:44.214
There.

10:44.835 --> 10:47.199
You think we ought to find who shot at Smokey?

10:47.219 --> 10:48.481
I think I know who shot at him.

10:48.501 --> 10:49.082
What do you mean?

10:49.602 --> 10:54.630
Well, Smokey, you little rascal, I reckon I'd have done the very same thing to you.

10:54.830 --> 10:55.932
Why, Uncle Bill...

10:56.249 --> 10:57.712
You would have shot Smokey.

10:57.732 --> 10:59.274
Now, Smokey wasn't shot, June.

10:59.315 --> 11:02.641
He was shot at, let's say, with the bullets going well above his head.

11:02.961 --> 11:04.524
How do you know all that, Ranger Bill?

11:04.584 --> 11:07.169
Now, look here at Smokey's nose where he was licking so hard.

11:07.730 --> 11:07.950
No, no, no.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.232
Take it easy, Smokey.

11:09.292 --> 11:10.194
No one's going to hurt you.

11:11.396 --> 11:13.600
Why, there's some kind of gummy substance on his nose.

11:13.620 --> 11:14.061
That's right.

11:14.221 --> 11:15.684
Yellowish, sticky stuff.

11:16.065 --> 11:16.886
That's honey, June.

11:17.407 --> 11:19.050
Bears love honey more than...

11:19.486 --> 11:20.187
Anything else?

11:20.347 --> 11:21.529
I don't get it, Granger, Bill.

11:21.970 --> 11:25.936
Smokey just couldn't resist getting some honey, so he made a raid on a beehive.

11:25.956 --> 11:26.917
Holy cow!

11:26.937 --> 11:28.219
But those shots we heard.

11:28.239 --> 11:32.025
Well, the beehive that Smokey probably raided happens to belong to Mr. Jenkins.

11:32.606 --> 11:35.871
His place is up ahead, just outside the wildlife boundary.

11:35.891 --> 11:40.838
No, Mr. Jenkins is one of our best cooperators, and that's why I'm pretty sure that he didn't shoot to kill.

11:41.319 --> 11:43.502
He was just chasing Smokey off his property.

11:44.410 --> 11:45.972
Gee, that's bad.

11:45.992 --> 11:48.715
Well, I think we'll just pay a little visit to Mr. Jenkins.

11:48.936 --> 11:54.883
But, Uncle Bill, if Mr. Jenkins didn't mean to hurt Smokey... I'm not going to arrest Mr. Jenkins, if that's what you're thinking, June.

11:55.344 --> 11:58.808
I just want to thank him for making it so easy for us to capture Smokey again.

11:59.309 --> 12:05.717
And this time, we'll make sure Smokey doesn't get away until he's big enough and strong enough to really take care of himself in the woods.

12:06.498 --> 12:08.660
Well, suppose we travel along now, huh?

12:08.680 --> 12:09.321
Ranger Bill.

12:09.762 --> 12:10.603
Yes, sir?

12:10.623 --> 12:12.325
Well, Joe and I...

12:12.929 --> 12:15.873
We promised to be back at camp early today.

12:16.734 --> 12:19.897
I think maybe we'd better start back, if you don't mind.

12:19.917 --> 12:21.319
Sure, Sam, go on back.

12:21.339 --> 12:25.584
But what are you two youngsters looking so glum about?

12:26.085 --> 12:28.548
Haven't you had lots of fun today, the way everything turned out?

12:28.568 --> 12:29.489
Oh, sure, Ranger Bill.

12:29.969 --> 12:30.951
And we learned a lot, too.

12:30.971 --> 12:33.774
But, well, that's the trouble, kind of.

12:34.074 --> 12:35.816
I don't understand, Joe.

12:36.137 --> 12:41.383
What Joe's trying to say, Ranger Bill, is, well, we're going back home next week.

12:41.937 --> 12:46.001
Camp will be over, and we've only got one more day off to be with you and June.

12:46.202 --> 12:46.522
Well?

12:46.902 --> 12:52.228
What if you're too busy to bother with us and... Ah, you know, nothing to be mooning about.

12:52.789 --> 12:55.772
No, we'll get together next week and have a really swell time.

12:55.792 --> 12:56.272
You'll see.

12:56.933 --> 13:01.057
I promise you I'm not going to let anything interfere with our meeting once again before you leave.

13:01.498 --> 13:05.442
No, sir, not even a big, rip-roaring forest fire will stop our getting together.

13:06.183 --> 13:06.503
Okay?

13:06.803 --> 13:08.065
Okay, Ranger Bill.

13:08.165 --> 13:08.265
Okay.

13:09.224 --> 13:36.143
Well, when Ranger Bill says that not even a big, rip-roaring forest fire will keep him from seeing his friends once again, that's something all right.

13:36.545 --> 13:39.449
because forest fires a mighty bad business.

13:40.610 --> 13:48.800
Be sure to be with us next week when we join Ranger Bill, June, Joe, and Sam in the final exciting forest adventure of this series.

13:50.162 --> 13:56.630
Bill Scott, Forest Ranger, comes to you with the cooperation of the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture.

13:57.531 --> 14:02.717
Bill Scott is written by Bill Bergoffen and produced for radio by Van Renssela Brokhan.

14:03.558 --> 14:05.961
