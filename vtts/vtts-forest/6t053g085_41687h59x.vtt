00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
[Silence.]

00:14.000 --> 00:30.625
[Music.]

00:30.625 --> 00:34.253
Bill Scott, Forest Ranger!

00:41.669 --> 00:49.005
Today, we present the fifth program in a new series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, Forest Rangers.

00:49.559 --> 00:57.549
are seen as the interior of the little cabin perched high on the top of Hawk Tower, fire sentinel of a large part of Beaver Dam Forest.

00:57.569 --> 01:03.736
Ranger Bill and Sam have made a surprise call on the ranger's other assistant, Joe, on duty as fire lookout.

01:04.457 --> 01:13.688
While Ranger Bill's experienced eye takes in the appearance of the cabin and the condition of the tower man's equipment, Sam and Joe stand silently, watching the rangers every move.

01:14.429 --> 01:15.550
It's warm in the cabin,

01:16.103 --> 01:19.347
Strong summer sun beats down on the metal roof and walls.

01:19.987 --> 01:25.294
And in the distance, waves of shimmering heat seem to rise from the dry forest itself.

01:25.314 --> 01:26.695
There's no doubt about it.

01:27.036 --> 01:28.978
This is fire weather.

01:28.998 --> 01:30.600
Bad fire weather.

01:30.620 --> 01:34.324
But if Ranger Bill is really concerned, he doesn't seem to show it.

01:34.664 --> 01:37.407
You're doing a real good job keeping this cabin clean, Joe.

01:37.788 --> 01:38.629
Thank you, Ranger Bill.

01:38.889 --> 01:40.491
Equipment's in fine shape, too.

01:40.471 --> 01:42.575
I like to see a polished fire finder.

01:43.015 --> 01:43.817
Keeps it from rusting.

01:44.778 --> 01:49.346
Joe must have seen us coming up the trail and cleaned up everything before we got here.

01:49.727 --> 01:50.829
I did not, Sam.

01:51.249 --> 01:56.278
If I'd known Ranger Bill was going to inspect today, I'd have put a pot of coffee on the stove for him.

01:56.699 --> 01:57.740
Just relax, Joe.

01:57.961 --> 01:59.423
Sam's kidding you.

01:59.443 --> 02:01.407
And I'm not going to stay long enough to have coffee.

02:01.627 --> 02:03.430
But I didn't know you were coming, Ranger Bill.

02:03.771 --> 02:04.291
Honestly.

02:04.452 --> 02:05.213
Of course not.

02:05.581 --> 02:06.562
Now, where's your log?

02:06.723 --> 02:07.083
Log?

02:07.564 --> 02:14.313
Oh, oh, you mean the book that Joe uses to record the smoke he sees, the action he takes, phone calls, and stuff like that.

02:15.154 --> 02:16.135
There it is, Ranger Bill.

02:16.195 --> 02:16.376
Where?

02:16.576 --> 02:17.597
Right near the fire finder.

02:17.757 --> 02:18.238
Oh, yes, thanks.

02:19.280 --> 02:26.009
Oh, by the way, while I check the log, Sam, you help keep Joe's sharp lookout for any sign of smoke in the forest.

02:26.029 --> 02:27.751
Don't have to tell you how dry it is out there.

02:27.911 --> 02:28.472
Yes, sir.

02:29.313 --> 02:30.375
Say, there's my friend.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.938
Funny-looking flying contraption again, Sam.

02:33.188 --> 02:34.469
What are you talking about?

02:34.669 --> 02:35.370
Look over there.

02:35.891 --> 02:36.872
Out of the forest.

02:36.892 --> 02:37.953
That big farm there.

02:38.313 --> 02:39.054
See that airplane?

02:39.454 --> 02:40.275
Airplane?

02:40.295 --> 02:42.117
Why, Joe, that's a helicopter.

02:42.137 --> 02:43.178
Oh, sure, I know it.

02:43.478 --> 02:45.400
But it is a funny-looking contraption.

02:45.740 --> 02:46.841
It's been around all week.

02:47.222 --> 02:49.584
Oh, Chuck Evans finally got his helicopter, eh?

02:49.884 --> 02:50.705
Who's Chuck Evans?

02:50.825 --> 02:51.946
Very good friend of mine, boys.

02:52.467 --> 02:54.709
He and I palled along a lot when we were at college.

02:55.089 --> 02:57.972
Chuck took agriculture while I was studying forestry.

02:57.992 --> 02:59.634
Oh, is that his farm way over there?

02:59.914 --> 03:00.375
Yes, Joe.

03:00.935 --> 03:02.757
Done a swell job of building it up, too.

03:03.445 --> 03:05.829
Chuck is one of your real modern farmers, you might say.

03:06.349 --> 03:11.557
Practices soil conservation, uses the latest farm equipment, and he does a bang-up job.

03:11.577 --> 03:14.802
But the helicopter, that's not part of his farm equipment, huh?

03:15.122 --> 03:16.785
Chuck plans to use it that way, Sam.

03:17.286 --> 03:22.273
For spraying insecticides on his crops, sowing grass seed on his pastures, things like that.

03:22.293 --> 03:24.096
And, of course, to travel in.

03:24.116 --> 03:26.179
He'll have fun and still use it to work with.

03:26.210 --> 03:26.711
Oh, look.

03:26.952 --> 03:28.315
He's headed out into the forest.

03:28.335 --> 03:30.139
Golly, he flies low, doesn't he?

03:30.340 --> 03:32.725
That plane just seems to skim the treetops.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.429
That's one of the features of a helicopter.

03:34.509 --> 03:36.554
Its ability to fly low and at slow speed.

03:36.574 --> 03:37.216
Say, wait a minute.

03:37.697 --> 03:38.719
Do you see what I see?

03:38.840 --> 03:39.461
What is it, Joe?

03:39.481 --> 03:40.323
Do you mean the plane?

03:40.343 --> 03:40.884
No, no, no.

03:40.924 --> 03:41.967
Let me have your binoculars, Joe.

03:42.187 --> 03:42.769
Here you are, sir.

03:43.811 --> 03:44.573
Let me adjust them.

03:45.380 --> 03:46.201
Good gravy.

03:46.221 --> 03:46.502
Smoke.

03:46.642 --> 03:47.503
Where, Ranger Bill?

03:47.523 --> 03:48.104
Let me see.

03:48.264 --> 03:48.865
Here are the glasses.

03:48.885 --> 03:50.167
I'm going to look carefully.

03:50.187 --> 03:51.750
Right where Chuck Evans has started to circle.

03:51.830 --> 03:52.972
He must have seen it then, too.

03:53.352 --> 03:53.833
Oh, I see it.

03:54.013 --> 03:54.354
I see it.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.217
It looks like a thin column of mist.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.120
Oh, and it's miles from here.

03:58.260 --> 04:00.624
Yes, I place it way off there in the Deer Creek country.

04:01.345 --> 04:02.847
Couldn't be in a worse place.

04:02.867 --> 04:06.473
Golly, there isn't a road or trail into that area, is there, Ranger Bill?

04:06.593 --> 04:07.995
No, Sam, and that's the trouble.

04:08.600 --> 04:13.228
There's a fire in there in just about the most valuable watershed and timber area in Beaver Dam Forest.

04:13.268 --> 04:13.709
Golly.

04:13.870 --> 04:18.037
If it should blow up, I just don't know what... I'd like to get my hands on the bird who started it.

04:18.057 --> 04:21.724
I'm afraid this is the one case in ten where a human being is not at fault.

04:21.964 --> 04:22.505
Oh, sure.

04:22.826 --> 04:25.290
That dry lightning we had here several days ago.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.334
Yes, lightning must have struck a tree.

04:27.314 --> 04:55.650
The fire has probably been smoldering ever since and it's just broken out. But i recorded all the lightning strikes i saw, and i've checked them every day 
since. Now it's possible to miss one or two, Joe. This is one is just one that showed up. Well we've got to get busy. It'll take hours to get back in there 
on deer creek and... Look ranger bill. Mr. Evans' helicopter's headed straight this way. Good work. I bet Chuck wants to make sure that we've seen the smoke. 
Now Joe you get to your phone... no no no better use the radio,

04:55.816 --> 04:58.862
Get a bearing from Devil's Knob Tower and locate your fire.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.409
Then contact that trail building crew at Twin Fox and head them onto the fire.

05:02.429 --> 05:06.257
But, Ranger Bill, they're all of 15 miles from Deer Creek.

05:06.277 --> 05:06.557
I know.

05:06.577 --> 05:09.223
And they'll have at least a 10-mile hike into the area.

05:09.243 --> 05:09.924
I know that, boy.

05:10.064 --> 05:11.968
We've just got to hope they'll get there in time.

05:12.404 --> 05:13.986
Sam and I will head in, too, from here.

05:14.407 --> 05:15.308
Here he comes.

05:15.328 --> 05:16.310
Mr. Evans, I mean.

05:16.790 --> 05:18.573
Golly, he's flying close to the tower.

05:18.793 --> 05:19.855
I can even see him now.

05:20.275 --> 05:21.056
He knows I'm here.

05:21.617 --> 05:23.540
Probably has seen my pickup truck down below.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.583
See, he's pointing back toward the smoke.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.526
Hawk Tower to Devil's Knob Tower.

05:27.806 --> 05:28.507
Hawk Tower to Devil's Knob Tower.

05:28.527 --> 05:30.330
Chuck is headed back to his farm.

05:30.350 --> 05:30.911
Come on, Sam.

05:31.411 --> 05:31.932
No, wait.

05:31.952 --> 05:32.192
Joe.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.054
Yes, sir?

05:33.074 --> 05:34.436
I'm trying to get Devil's Knob.

05:34.496 --> 05:35.798
Well, carry on as I told you, Joe.

05:36.178 --> 05:39.643
And if the smoke builds up, get as many men on their way to that fire as you think are needed.

05:39.927 --> 05:40.788
Now stay with it, boy.

05:40.868 --> 05:41.229
Yes, sir.

05:41.650 --> 05:42.992
Hawk Tower to Devil's Knob.

05:43.673 --> 05:44.835
Let's go, Sam.

05:44.855 --> 05:45.916
There's no time to spare.

05:46.036 --> 05:46.417
Okay.

06:06.568 --> 06:08.331
Now that's Chuck Evans' place just ahead there.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.649
Well, we haven't wasted much time as yet.

06:10.669 --> 06:12.591
Oh, I see him, Ranger Bill, in that field there.

06:13.171 --> 06:15.314
Isn't that Mr. Evans standing near the plane?

06:15.434 --> 06:16.835
That's Chuck, all right.

06:16.855 --> 06:18.517
And he hasn't cut the plane's motor either.

06:18.537 --> 06:18.977
That's good.

06:19.538 --> 06:21.820
Golly, don't drive too close, Ranger Bill.

06:22.481 --> 06:23.222
Well, here we are.

06:25.784 --> 06:26.405
Hello, Bill.

06:26.605 --> 06:27.947
I had a hunch you'd ride this way.

06:28.307 --> 06:29.288
Made good time, too.

06:29.548 --> 06:31.350
Well, I never could outsmart you, Chuck, could I?

06:32.011 --> 06:33.272
I take it you know why I'm here.

06:33.674 --> 06:36.558
Oh, by the way, this is Sam Freeman on a summer job with me.

06:36.839 --> 06:37.740
Oh, hello, Mr. Evans.

06:37.900 --> 06:39.102
Nice to know you, Sam.

06:39.122 --> 06:40.323
Well, Ranger, what are we waiting for?

06:40.344 --> 06:42.046
Well, what do you think, Chuck?

06:42.066 --> 06:44.069
Can we make it into Deer Creek in this plane of yours?

06:44.389 --> 06:45.931
Holy smoke, Ranger Bill.

06:46.192 --> 06:48.976
Is that the idea, to go to the fire in the helicopter?

06:48.996 --> 06:50.278
That's it, Sam.

06:50.298 --> 06:51.459
But it's really up to Chuck here.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.903
As I said, what are we waiting for?

06:54.404 --> 06:56.907
Seriously, though, Bill, I think we can make it.

06:56.927 --> 06:59.631
I don't know about the landing, but...

06:59.948 --> 07:03.833
I don't mind telling you we've got to get to that fire in a hurry if we're not to have a mess on our hands.

07:03.873 --> 07:05.476
I'll get the fire to us, Ranger Bill.

07:05.536 --> 07:07.218
Right, and bring that long rope, too, will you?

07:07.438 --> 07:08.640
How about the boy, Bill?

07:08.760 --> 07:09.401
Will he be all right?

07:09.702 --> 07:10.883
Don't worry about Sam, Chuck.

07:10.903 --> 07:11.845
He's as good as they come.

07:12.405 --> 07:14.889
It'll be quite an experience for him as well as for all of us.

07:14.909 --> 07:16.531
And you say that's pretty bad fire.

07:16.571 --> 07:18.474
It shouldn't trade country for a fire, eh, Bill?

07:18.534 --> 07:20.597
Well, not if we catch it quickly, Chuck.

07:20.617 --> 07:22.419
What I'm thinking about are the things at stake.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.362
A fine timber that might burn up.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.165
I've got a stake in that forest, too, Bill.

07:26.585 --> 07:27.947
The water I get from that forest.

07:28.298 --> 07:29.841
Mighty important to me.

07:29.861 --> 07:33.108
It takes only one bad fire sometimes to wipe out a watershed.

07:33.349 --> 07:35.373
Ruin it for years.

07:35.393 --> 07:36.315
Here you are, Ranger Bill.

07:36.335 --> 07:36.756
Now, fine.

07:36.936 --> 07:42.267
Backpack pump filled with water, shovel, axe, cross-cut saw, fire rake, oh, and the rope.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.049
Just right, Sam.

07:43.169 --> 07:44.291
Now, listen to me, both of you.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.855
I'll get in the plane first.

07:46.195 --> 07:47.438
Here, let me carry some of these tools.

07:47.890 --> 07:55.463
Now watch carefully how I approach the plane, and when I get in and signal to you, you approach it in the same way, from down front and one at a time, okay?

07:55.483 --> 07:56.164
Okay, Chuck.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.207
Oh, look, Ranger, Bill, he's bent way over.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.453
Well, that's to keep clear of the main rotor, that overhead propeller.

08:01.473 --> 08:03.015
All right, Sam, Chuck is signaling to us.

08:03.436 --> 08:04.718
Go ahead.

08:04.738 --> 08:05.359
Way over now.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.982
Go in from the front.

08:07.002 --> 08:10.668
Yes, sir, I'm going.

08:10.688 --> 08:11.349
Get him back there.

08:11.690 --> 08:13.493
We'll let the range have the seat up front with me.

08:13.810 --> 08:14.412
Here he comes.

08:14.613 --> 08:15.536
Here are the rest of the tools.

08:16.017 --> 08:16.759
You all right, Sam?

08:16.800 --> 08:17.642
I think so, sir.

08:17.783 --> 08:18.726
Fasten your seatbelt, Bill.

08:18.766 --> 08:19.649
We're ready to take off.

08:19.849 --> 08:20.471
All set, Chuck.

08:22.759 --> 08:23.922
Well, we're off the ground.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.828
This plant handles our weight easily.

08:26.370 --> 08:27.052
All right, Sam.

08:27.092 --> 08:27.634
Relax.

08:28.255 --> 08:30.802
You don't have to hang on to my shoulder so hard anymore.

08:31.142 --> 08:34.050
I didn't realize I was hanging on, Ranger Bill.

08:34.070 --> 08:35.173
Gee, this is all right.

08:35.714 --> 08:38.140
Funny I didn't feel any forward motion at all.

08:38.581 --> 08:41.268
No, it's quite different from riding in an ordinary plane.

08:41.389 --> 08:43.073
Well, how long will it take us to get there, Chuck?

08:43.153 --> 08:44.256
Oh, just a matter of minutes.

08:44.236 --> 08:45.958
You watched me when I flew over before.

08:46.279 --> 08:48.823
Golly, that's something, isn't it, Ranger Bill?

08:48.843 --> 08:52.508
Compared to the time it will take our firefighting crews to get there on foot.

08:52.528 --> 08:54.230
It may make all the difference in the world.

08:54.391 --> 08:59.278
Well, if a plane can save so much time in getting to a fire, why don't they use planes more?

08:59.358 --> 09:00.940
Well, they do, Sam, in a number of places.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.546
Particularly in the mountains of the west, in the lake states, even parts of the south.

09:05.747 --> 09:08.451
I suppose you've got the smoke jumpers in mind and regular planes.

09:08.471 --> 09:08.731
Right.

09:08.871 --> 09:09.692
Smoke jumpers?

09:09.752 --> 09:10.313
Who are they?

09:10.333 --> 09:13.458
They're firefighters, Sam, who go to forest fires by parachute.

09:13.558 --> 09:13.618
Oh.

09:14.003 --> 09:15.765
That must take a lot of courage.

09:15.905 --> 09:16.926
Oh, they're brave, all right.

09:17.327 --> 09:21.632
And as well-trained for their double job of parachuting and firefighting as any men in the world.

09:21.732 --> 09:25.717
And they do a great job of putting out fires while the fires are still small, I've heard.

09:26.077 --> 09:29.001
Smoke junkers have been in the picture for a number of years.

09:29.021 --> 09:30.422
The use of the helicopter that's newer.

09:31.443 --> 09:33.506
Well, there's our fire just ahead, Chuck.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.188
Can you get us any lower?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.451
We'll be okay if we don't hit any down drafts.

09:37.471 --> 09:39.633
We've been pretty lucky about the wind so far.

09:40.094 --> 09:41.235
Wind's beginning to come up, though.

09:41.856 --> 09:43.137
Oh, just look at those treetops below.

09:43.157 --> 09:43.858
You see them move?

09:44.243 --> 09:45.284
What next, Bill?

09:45.304 --> 09:47.386
Well, I'd like to get down a little closer to the fire, Chuck.

09:48.407 --> 09:48.888
Can you make it?

09:48.908 --> 09:50.930
And then we can kind of hover over it.

09:51.250 --> 09:51.751
We'll try.

09:52.031 --> 09:52.792
Well, that's fine, Chuck.

09:52.812 --> 09:53.353
That's fine.

09:53.513 --> 09:54.854
Just hold it there if you can.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.219
Well, the fire's still confined to just that big old snag.

09:59.239 --> 09:59.960
Can you see it?

09:59.980 --> 10:00.860
Look, Ranger Bill.

10:01.081 --> 10:02.943
Some burning stuff just fell to the ground.

10:03.283 --> 10:05.045
Hey, it set the grass on fire.

10:05.245 --> 10:06.306
Well, we got here in time.

10:06.747 --> 10:07.988
What are we going to do about it, Bill?

10:08.228 --> 10:09.970
There's no place to land anywhere close.

10:09.990 --> 10:10.951
Look out, Mr. Evans.

10:10.971 --> 10:12.513
We're going to hit a tree.

10:12.773 --> 10:12.833
Oh!

10:17.808 --> 10:19.150
Well, that was a close one, Chuck.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.292
Better stay up here a minute.

10:21.312 --> 10:22.273
What are you going to do, Bill?

10:22.614 --> 10:25.437
That fire will make headway if you don't get down there on it right away.

10:25.737 --> 10:26.819
Sam, where's that long rope?

10:27.179 --> 10:28.080
Here it is, Ranger Bill.

10:28.661 --> 10:29.962
See, what are you doing?

10:30.223 --> 10:33.006
Just putting some nuts in it for handholds, that's all.

10:33.026 --> 10:35.329
Say, you might get down like that at that.

10:35.889 --> 10:38.392
Work down close again, Chuck, but be careful, though.

10:38.412 --> 10:40.735
There's a spot right here where the trees aren't so high.

10:41.216 --> 10:42.237
I can hold it here a bit.

10:42.417 --> 10:42.757
Oh, good.

10:43.538 --> 10:44.980
Sam, let me have the hand tools, will you?

10:45.415 --> 10:47.258
I can toss them down without hurting them.

10:47.278 --> 10:49.321
We're at about 22 feet, Bill.

10:49.341 --> 10:50.944
Well, first the axe.

10:50.964 --> 10:51.545
There she goes.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.127
Now the shovel.

10:54.489 --> 10:56.052
Now the firing.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.474
Now that does it.

10:57.494 --> 10:59.117
Now I'll just tie this rope to the seat here.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.282
Now help me on with this pump on my back, will you, Sam?

11:02.322 --> 11:04.225
That fire's beginning to go places, Ranger.

11:04.285 --> 11:05.968
Well, I think I can hold her if this just works.

11:06.869 --> 11:08.652
Sam, you stay with Chuck.

11:08.672 --> 11:09.313
No, sirs.

11:09.496 --> 11:10.658
What's that?

11:10.678 --> 11:13.843
I'm sorry, Ranger Bill, but gosh, I want to go, too.

11:13.903 --> 11:15.846
Better let him go, Bill.

11:15.866 --> 11:19.451
I think you'll need him down there, and I can hold a plane on this spot.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.314
Well, okay.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.638
I'll go first.

11:23.658 --> 11:25.120
You'll follow me when I wave to you, Sam.

11:25.861 --> 11:28.225
There may be a little drop at the end of the rope, so be careful.

11:28.626 --> 11:28.726
Okay.

11:28.746 --> 11:29.607
Steady does it, Bill.

11:29.988 --> 11:31.049
Thanks, Chuck.

11:31.069 --> 11:32.031
I think this will work.

11:32.932 --> 11:35.396
I don't mind telling you you've helped to turn the trick today.

11:35.717 --> 11:36.758
I'll stand by for you.

11:37.640 --> 11:37.900
Well...

11:38.099 --> 11:39.700
We'll hike out after the job is done.

11:39.720 --> 11:40.381
No need to do that.

11:40.401 --> 11:41.302
You've been swell, Chuck.

11:41.562 --> 11:41.942
Okay.

11:42.403 --> 11:44.044
Slide out the door now.

11:44.064 --> 11:44.785
Good luck, Bill.

11:45.385 --> 11:45.966
Watch him, Sam.

11:46.426 --> 11:49.209
There he goes, hand over hand down the rope.

11:50.550 --> 11:51.551
He's going to let go.

11:51.571 --> 11:53.513
There, he made it, Mr. Evans.

11:53.533 --> 11:54.353
He made it fine.

11:55.034 --> 11:55.915
He's on his feet now.

11:55.955 --> 11:56.875
He's waiting to us.

11:56.895 --> 11:57.916
Easy does it, Sam.

11:58.757 --> 12:00.178
Good luck, fella.

12:00.198 --> 12:00.819
Thank you, sir.

12:01.339 --> 12:02.921
Well, here I go.

12:03.902 --> 12:04.742
That's it, Sam.

12:05.643 --> 12:06.604
Slowly does it.

12:07.445 --> 12:08.126
A drop.

12:08.146 --> 12:08.807
Get your knees up.

12:10.289 --> 12:11.090
Ah, good boy.

12:11.991 --> 12:13.112
You all right, Sam?

12:13.132 --> 12:14.434
Yes, sir.

12:14.454 --> 12:16.437
A little wind knocked out of me, that's all.

12:16.457 --> 12:16.757
Fine.

12:17.458 --> 12:18.780
I've got the tools all together here.

12:19.361 --> 12:22.425
We'll wet this grass fire down first, make our fire line.

12:23.005 --> 12:24.748
Then we'll knock that old snag down and out.

12:25.629 --> 12:29.754
We'll save this watershed, boy, you and I, before the crew even has time to get here.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.016
Then you don't mind?

12:31.336 --> 12:33.840
Well, you don't mind my mutiny up there in the helicopter?

12:34.040 --> 12:35.261
Mind, Sam?

12:35.281 --> 12:36.523
I wouldn't have it any other way.

12:37.347 --> 12:38.608
Well, come on, we've got work to do.

12:39.289 --> 12:41.070
I'll use the pump and you get busy with the race.

12:41.090 --> 12:41.631
Yes, sir.

12:42.411 --> 12:43.913
All right, you old rascal.

12:44.313 --> 12:45.914
Fire, here we come.

12:54.762 --> 12:58.265
Fire, here we come.

12:59.266 --> 13:06.392
Fire, here we come.

13:10.422 --> 13:20.537
And so, we leave Ranger Bill and Sam to finish the job at hand, the job of saving the precious forest watershed from destruction.

13:20.557 --> 13:30.592
Next week, the last one that Joe, Sam, and June will spend with Ranger Bill this summer, we'll join our friends as they enjoy a farewell dinner of barbecued steaks.

13:31.353 --> 13:38.143
There'll be some laughs and some excitement, too, as our young friends find themselves trapped by a landslide.

13:38.764 --> 13:39.906
Be sure to listen.

13:41.017 --> 13:45.982
Bill Scott, forest ranger, comes to you with a cooperation of the Forest Service, U.S.

13:46.022 --> 13:47.103
Department of Agriculture.

13:47.683 --> 13:52.668
Bill Scott is written by Bill Bergoffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokaw.

13:53.209 --> 13:55.045
Your narrator has been Al Reilly.

13:55.045 --> 15:31.646
