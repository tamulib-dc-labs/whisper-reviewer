00:31.435 --> 00:33.277
Forest Rangers!

00:35.020 --> 00:47.956
Today, we present the third program in a new series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, Forest Rangers.

00:48.857 --> 00:55.145
A scene is a rocky ledge high above the little town of Fairview just outside of Beaver Dam Forest.

00:55.165 --> 01:00.632
Ranger Bill Scott and his young assistant Sam are sitting on the big rock taking it easy.

01:00.730 --> 01:06.917
They have just finished a sandwich lunch after a hard morning's work of exploring and mapping the land about them.

01:06.937 --> 01:14.326
Now as we join them, Sam reaches into his pocket, pulls out his harmonica, moistens his lips, and starts to play.

01:16.008 --> 01:22.636
Ranger Bill, huffing on his pipe, smiles at the music, and yet it's obvious his thoughts are elsewhere.

01:22.656 --> 01:27.902
He keeps looking off to the north, where a strange formation of dark clouds has begun to take shape.

01:28.878 --> 01:36.371
His smile suddenly gives way to a tightening of his lips as he expertly pounds out his pipe ashes upon the rock and crushes them with the heel of his boots.

01:37.172 --> 01:40.678
A slight frown creases his now serious face.

01:40.698 --> 01:48.551
But Sam, not noticing, plays on.

01:48.571 --> 01:49.473
There.

01:49.493 --> 01:52.858
Now that that's out of my system, I'm ready to go to work again, Ranger Bill.

01:53.039 --> 01:55.122
Well, I'm afraid we're through here for today, Sam.

01:55.186 --> 02:00.651
But I thought we were going to put the full day in on this survey for the Fairview Town Council.

02:01.011 --> 02:03.954
Well, it would be foolish to get started again with that storm coming up.

02:04.354 --> 02:06.456
Say, I hadn't noticed it before.

02:07.037 --> 02:08.918
Could be a bad storm, too, huh, Ranger Bill?

02:09.219 --> 02:09.519
Maybe.

02:10.219 --> 02:11.901
And it's a local one, unfortunately.

02:12.101 --> 02:17.226
From what we've seen of this watershed area, a local storm won't help things much, will it?

02:17.246 --> 02:18.947
After the general rains we've had, too.

02:19.047 --> 02:20.689
You're right, Sam.

02:20.709 --> 02:23.151
All this watershed land above Fairview has been...

02:23.418 --> 02:25.380
Suffering some pretty rough treatment through the years.

02:25.860 --> 02:27.482
There's been too much timber cut off.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.444
The range areas have been overgrazed.

02:30.245 --> 02:33.608
And that big fire that whipped through here last year didn't help a bit either.

02:33.628 --> 02:36.251
Just like that Rockville area, isn't it, Ranger Bill?

02:36.731 --> 02:41.716
Golly, I'll never forget that flood last summer and the way we kept the water out of the sawmill.

02:41.876 --> 02:44.078
Well, that's a bit different, Sam.

02:44.098 --> 02:51.045
The conditions are about the same, but there's no big man-made reservoir between this highland and Fairview, remember?

02:51.616 --> 02:55.181
The folks at Rockville had plenty of time to get out of town before the dam gave way.

02:56.303 --> 02:57.425
Yes, it's different here.

02:57.705 --> 03:00.129
But I don't understand, Ranger Bill.

03:00.289 --> 03:08.902
Well, look, Sam, the danger of a terrible flash flood building up here and rushing down on Fairview with hardly any warning is very great.

03:08.922 --> 03:16.052
You know, it doesn't take much when the soil is poor and protective covering of grass, bushes, and trees is almost gone.

03:16.072 --> 03:19.277
One heavy downpour of rain sometime and look out.

03:19.297 --> 03:21.420
But Fairview's had other floods in the past.

03:21.687 --> 03:24.671
That's why the town council plans to do something about it, isn't it?

03:25.191 --> 03:25.332
Mm-hmm.

03:25.352 --> 03:30.979
You told me that it has cost them plenty to repair the damage to roads and bridges and homes each time.

03:31.399 --> 03:32.801
That's really why we're here.

03:33.202 --> 03:33.742
Yes, Sam.

03:34.463 --> 03:42.653
Mayor Arnold and the Fairview town council made up their minds years ago to buy up all of this tax-deliquent, clear-cut, burned and eroded land here on the watershed.

03:43.354 --> 03:45.777
To plant it all up and make a community forest out of it.

03:46.979 --> 03:50.243
But as so often happens, they haven't done much more than that.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.784
I hope our survey here would help, Sam, and yet I don't know.

03:54.804 --> 03:57.047
Wow, it's really going to rain, isn't it?

03:57.067 --> 03:58.749
See, I just felt the first drop.

03:59.329 --> 04:00.611
Let's get out of here, Ranger Bill.

04:00.771 --> 04:03.314
I want a Radio Joe on Hawk Tower first.

04:03.334 --> 04:07.859
You know, Sam, it's a fine idea for a Ranger to let somebody know where he is and what he's doing all the time.

04:07.959 --> 04:09.881
Yes, sir.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.644
It's a good thing we've got the radio hooked up inside the truck cab.

04:13.365 --> 04:15.347
Come on, let's get in before we get soaked.

04:15.447 --> 04:15.848
Okay.

04:18.150 --> 04:19.892
I'll turn the set on and let it warm up a bit.

04:21.205 --> 04:21.906
There we are.

04:21.926 --> 04:24.109
It's raining hotter and hotter every minute.

04:24.489 --> 04:26.512
Think we're in for a cloudburst, Ranger Bill?

04:26.532 --> 04:27.493
It looks that way, Sam.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.757
Well, I'm going to try Hawk Tower.

04:30.777 --> 04:31.958
SP-7 to Hawk Tower.

04:32.919 --> 04:34.061
SP-7 to Hawk Tower.

04:34.121 --> 04:34.862
Come in, Hawk Tower.

04:35.723 --> 04:37.245
Hawk Tower, back to SP-7.

04:37.645 --> 04:38.486
Come in, Ranger Bill.

04:38.707 --> 04:40.729
Boy, his signal's fine.

04:40.749 --> 04:41.330
Hello, Joe.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.574
Looks like our work here is washed up for today.

04:44.594 --> 04:46.716
We'll be heading back to the ranger station.

04:46.736 --> 04:47.738
You have anything to report?

04:48.318 --> 04:48.799
Come in.

04:49.538 --> 04:51.921
That must be a bad storm where you and Sam are.

04:52.241 --> 04:54.864
I can see the heavy black clouds from the tower.

04:54.884 --> 04:56.125
It's clear and dry here.

04:56.606 --> 04:58.248
I have nothing to report.

04:58.428 --> 04:59.949
Oh, no, no, wait.

04:59.969 --> 05:01.331
I almost forgot.

05:01.351 --> 05:03.313
June won't be with us for supper tonight.

05:03.754 --> 05:09.120
She called the tower and said she's going to Fairview to spend the night with her friend, Penny Perkins.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.541
Penny's folks are away.

05:10.881 --> 05:11.782
Did you get that?

05:11.802 --> 05:12.323
Come in.

05:13.096 --> 05:15.900
Did you see that lightning flash, Ranger Bill?

05:16.401 --> 05:18.825
Say, isn't it dangerous using the radio?

05:19.186 --> 05:20.287
Say, let's get out of here, huh?

05:20.307 --> 05:21.048
In a few minutes, Sam.

05:21.890 --> 05:22.431
Okay, Joe.

05:22.891 --> 05:23.833
I'll try to call you later.

05:24.394 --> 05:25.976
SB-7, clear with Hawk Tower.

05:26.637 --> 05:27.398
Hawk Tower off.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.161
Oh.

05:29.181 --> 05:30.904
So June's headed for Fairview, is she?

05:31.945 --> 05:36.613
If we don't get started soon, Ranger Bill, we'll be floating down Devil's Run.

05:36.633 --> 05:38.736
There's water under our car wheels right now.

05:38.836 --> 05:39.998
We're on our way, Sam.

05:45.243 --> 05:47.486
Gee, where are you going?

05:47.506 --> 05:49.989
The road to the Ranger Station is off the other way.

05:50.009 --> 05:52.091
Oh, I've changed my mind about going back to the station.

05:52.131 --> 05:52.672
But why?

05:53.012 --> 05:55.855
Well, boy, I just don't like the way things look, that's all.

05:56.036 --> 05:58.739
But you're heading right down along Devil's Run, Ranger Bill.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.179
That's right.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.582
There's an old logging road down the ravine, Sam.

06:02.123 --> 06:04.786
It might get us to Fairview faster than any other road we could take.

06:05.066 --> 06:05.587
What do you mean?

06:05.607 --> 06:07.329
It might get us there faster.

06:07.569 --> 06:10.052
Well, I haven't been over it in some time, Sam.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.439
There may be a tree across it or something.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.642
Worth a chance, though, with this storm building up every minute.

06:15.162 --> 06:20.128
Hmm, this road runs pretty close to the stream in places, doesn't it?

06:20.148 --> 06:22.271
Steve, that's funny.

06:22.291 --> 06:24.974
There was no stream on Devil's Run this morning.

06:25.234 --> 06:26.896
Rainwater has to go somewhere, Sam.

06:27.657 --> 06:30.881
With most of the forest covering gone, well, what's to hold it back?

06:30.961 --> 06:32.503
Golly, I see what you mean.

06:33.203 --> 06:34.605
I've got to speed this truck up a bit.

06:35.530 --> 06:38.575
Holy smoke, the water's building up too, Ranger Bill.

06:39.096 --> 06:41.861
What you're witnessing, Sam, is the beginning of a flash flood.

06:42.583 --> 06:45.127
And I'm afraid this is just the beginning.

06:45.147 --> 06:46.910
The water will really get high downstream.

06:47.071 --> 06:48.634
And Fairview is downstream.

06:48.674 --> 06:52.100
Yes, and the Perkins place, remember, is right on the edge of Devil's Run above the town.

06:52.501 --> 06:54.344
Say, June might be there.

06:54.384 --> 06:55.987
June and Penny Perkins too, Sam.

06:56.969 --> 06:58.872
Well, I just hope we get there in time.

07:00.472 --> 07:10.104
The truck speeds wildly down the rough logging road.

07:10.124 --> 07:11.946
Precious minutes pass by.

07:11.966 --> 07:23.340
Meantime, far downstream, the accumulation of runaway rainwater from all parts of the overcut, overgraved, and burned watershed fills up into a frightening flood, overflowing the banks of Devil's Run.

07:23.658 --> 07:27.202
It fills the basement and beats away at the bottom floor of the Perkins home.

07:27.682 --> 07:32.868
It throws huge rocks and uprooted trees against the bridge that ties the main highway to the town of Fairview.

07:33.469 --> 07:41.358
Here and there, water covers the narrow woods road, but the ground beneath is hard, and the truck moves on and on through the water.

07:49.066 --> 07:50.728
Finally, the way is easier.

07:51.063 --> 07:56.751
The road dips downward and just out of reach are the swollen waters of Devil's Run.

07:56.771 --> 07:57.973
Won't be long now, Sam.

07:58.493 --> 07:59.234
We're almost there.

07:59.635 --> 08:01.618
Golly, look at that high water, will you?

08:02.058 --> 08:03.721
Good thing we're above Devil's Run.

08:04.462 --> 08:06.665
Say, it's not raining very hard anymore.

08:06.805 --> 08:09.829
Yeah, but there's more water coming down out of the hills every minute, though.

08:09.849 --> 08:10.009
Oh.

08:10.510 --> 08:11.632
That's got me worried, Sam.

08:11.672 --> 08:12.673
I don't mind telling you.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.896
You mean you're worried about June and Penny?

08:15.337 --> 08:17.240
Perkins Place is just across Devil's Run.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.703
The water must be very high right there now.

08:19.919 --> 08:21.361
There's only one way to get across.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.144
That's the bridge, and I'm wondering... Holy smoke!

08:24.164 --> 08:25.005
Look, Ranger Bill.

08:25.085 --> 08:25.325
What?

08:25.345 --> 08:25.826
Up ahead.

08:26.286 --> 08:27.668
Oh, yes, I see.

08:27.688 --> 08:29.790
Two people right on the road near the edge of the rising water.

08:29.810 --> 08:30.831
They're waving at us to stop.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.052
It's June, Ranger Bill.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.876
One of them is June, but that's not Penny with her.

08:34.896 --> 08:35.957
It's a man.

08:36.317 --> 08:38.059
It's the mayor of Fairview.

08:38.079 --> 08:39.280
Yeah, Mayor Arnold.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.163
Right across the flood from them is the Perkins place.

08:41.323 --> 08:43.345
Golly, where is Penny?

08:43.365 --> 08:45.167
I'd better stop the car before I skid into them.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.201
Hi there, June.

08:51.701 --> 08:52.482
Hello, Mayor Arnold.

08:52.623 --> 08:55.306
Oh, Uncle Bill, I'm so glad you're here.

08:55.566 --> 08:57.969
Ranger, this is bad, mighty bad.

08:57.989 --> 08:58.670
Where's Penny, June?

08:59.010 --> 09:02.815
She's there, over there across Devil Drunk, in her house.

09:02.915 --> 09:05.699
Holy smoke, that place is almost underwater.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.581
We've got to get that girl out of there.

09:07.601 --> 09:09.804
Come on, let's drive down to the bridge and try getting across to her.

09:09.944 --> 09:11.686
Oh, the bridge washed out, Uncle Bill.

09:12.186 --> 09:13.308
I couldn't get across.

09:13.388 --> 09:14.129
That's right, Ranger.

09:14.389 --> 09:17.413
I met this young lady on this side of the bridge just before it collapsed.

09:17.553 --> 09:17.873
I see.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.255
I was checking on the flood.

09:19.572 --> 09:22.458
Well, sir, most of the folks are working right in town.

09:22.799 --> 09:27.528
I don't believe any of them realize Miss Perkins is trapped in her home, and we can't get word to them.

09:27.628 --> 09:29.492
Oh, Uncle Bill, what are we going to do?

09:29.773 --> 09:31.516
There now, June, we'll figure something out.

09:31.576 --> 09:37.027
Golly, if you only had your new horse, Sparks, here, Ranger Bill, he could swim you across, I bet.

09:37.248 --> 09:38.931
Yes, I think Sparks could do it at that.

09:40.042 --> 09:41.263
Sam, you've given me an idea.

09:41.684 --> 09:44.267
Ranger, if you can get that young lady out of there.

09:44.287 --> 09:46.630
Why, the whole town of Fairview will never forget it.

09:46.930 --> 09:47.551
No, sir.

09:47.811 --> 09:50.014
You've got my word as mayor for that.

09:50.054 --> 09:53.658
How about doing something about those hills back up there that caused this year after year?

09:54.619 --> 09:56.361
How about that community forest mayor?

09:56.742 --> 09:57.583
Anything, Ranger.

09:57.743 --> 09:59.465
I promise that I'll do anything for you.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.127
Sam, get that rope out of the truck and hurry.

10:01.207 --> 10:01.908
Yes, sir.

10:01.928 --> 10:02.669
Look, Uncle Bill.

10:02.989 --> 10:04.270
There are Penny's house.

10:04.290 --> 10:06.453
That water's already up to the second floor.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.554
And it's still going up.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.535
That's not what I mean.

10:08.736 --> 10:09.036
Look.

10:09.252 --> 10:13.138
There's a white sheet of something being waved up and down from our bedroom window.

10:13.158 --> 10:13.438
Good.

10:13.979 --> 10:14.840
Penny must see us then.

10:15.501 --> 10:16.643
Here's the rope, Ranger Bill.

10:16.903 --> 10:18.125
Will it be long enough?

10:18.145 --> 10:18.545
I think so.

10:19.367 --> 10:20.729
Now listen, all of you.

10:20.749 --> 10:23.753
I'm going to tie one end of this rope to my belt and try to get across to Penny.

10:24.314 --> 10:26.998
Now you three will have to drag us back through the water if I make it.

10:27.679 --> 10:29.101
I'll tie the other end to a tree, Sam.

10:29.862 --> 10:32.025
I'm going to take off my shirt and these heavy boots.

10:32.285 --> 10:35.069
But Uncle Bill, you can't swim across there.

10:35.089 --> 10:36.532
The cards are too strong.

10:36.572 --> 10:37.453
I'm ready now.

10:38.114 --> 10:38.955
No, I know that you'll.

10:39.307 --> 10:42.690
I'm going upstream a ways and let the current work me to Penny's house as I swim.

10:42.830 --> 10:44.792
Good man, that may do it at that.

10:45.053 --> 10:46.254
Well, here goes.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.756
And keep a tight hold on that rope, do you hear?

10:49.076 --> 10:49.977
Good luck, Ranger.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.539
Yes, Uncle Bill, good luck.

10:52.039 --> 10:54.261
Oh, golly, he's going way upstream, isn't he?

10:54.441 --> 10:56.764
He's not underestimating the strength of the current, that's all.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.145
There he goes into the water.

10:58.666 --> 10:59.687
Boy, what a dive.

10:59.727 --> 11:00.527
Now he's swimming.

11:00.808 --> 11:02.149
Man, what powerful slope.

11:02.169 --> 11:03.971
He doesn't seem to be making much headway, though.

11:04.311 --> 11:05.432
What if he swept past the house?

11:05.412 --> 11:06.614
Don't say that, girl.

11:06.634 --> 11:07.174
He'll make it.

11:07.234 --> 11:07.815
I know he will.

11:07.835 --> 11:08.716
Oh, you bet he will.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.338
Look, he's headed right for the place.

11:10.358 --> 11:12.201
Oh, please, please, Mr. Work, Uncle Bill.

11:12.221 --> 11:13.482
He's done it.

11:13.502 --> 11:14.344
He's done it.

11:14.364 --> 11:16.086
He's right over the front porch now.

11:16.186 --> 11:16.426
There.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.729
Look, he's swimming toward the window where the white sheet is.

11:18.749 --> 11:20.271
Look, Penny's coming out of the window.

11:20.532 --> 11:22.694
Ranger Bill's tying the rope around her way, too.

11:22.714 --> 11:23.856
He's waving at us.

11:23.936 --> 11:25.037
He wants us to start pulling.

11:25.178 --> 11:27.080
Come on, now, get a good tight grip on it.

11:27.100 --> 11:27.601
All right, now.

11:27.981 --> 11:28.422
Pull.

11:28.442 --> 11:29.263
There.

11:29.283 --> 11:29.383
Pull.

11:29.944 --> 11:30.304
That's it.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.085
Come on, Uncle Bill.

11:31.145 --> 11:32.167
We're doing it.

11:32.407 --> 11:32.787
Pull.

11:33.108 --> 11:33.208
Pull.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.336
Be careful.

11:34.356 --> 11:35.337
Penny's underwater.

11:35.357 --> 11:35.958
No, no.

11:36.138 --> 11:37.960
Ranger's lifting her up as high as he can.

11:38.040 --> 11:38.521
Come on, now.

11:38.541 --> 11:39.422
Just a little walk.

11:39.542 --> 11:40.863
Oh, come on.

11:41.164 --> 11:41.684
Oh, boy.

11:41.844 --> 11:42.465
Here they come.

11:42.845 --> 11:43.386
All right.

11:43.406 --> 11:43.847
Hold on.

11:43.867 --> 11:44.728
Don't pull anymore.

11:44.748 --> 11:45.488
They're standing up.

11:46.389 --> 11:47.030
Oh, poor Penny.

11:47.270 --> 11:48.392
She looks all in.

11:48.412 --> 11:49.032
No wonder.

11:49.052 --> 11:50.033
That was tough going.

11:50.414 --> 11:52.456
See, Ranger Bill has lifted her up in his arm.

11:52.797 --> 11:54.018
He's carrying her into shore.

11:54.579 --> 11:55.740
Nice going, Ranger.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.701
Nice work.

11:57.161 --> 11:59.564
Uncle Bill, what's the matter with Penny?

11:59.584 --> 12:03.128
Her eyes are closed, and her face is so pale.

12:03.918 --> 12:06.503
I think she's fainted, that's all, June.

12:06.523 --> 12:07.145
Put her down now.

12:08.508 --> 12:09.590
There.

12:09.610 --> 12:10.672
Let's keep your eye on her, June.

12:11.394 --> 12:13.177
Got to get her to a warm place as soon as we can.

12:14.119 --> 12:15.462
Sam, get the truck, will you?

12:16.123 --> 12:18.769
We'll drive to Tom Glover's ranch outside the flood area.

12:18.789 --> 12:20.933
Here's your shirt, Ranger Bill, and I'll be right back.

12:21.535 --> 12:22.156
Ranger Scott?

12:22.777 --> 12:23.479
Yes, Mayor Arnold?

12:23.920 --> 12:25.082
I meant what I said, Ranger.

12:25.349 --> 12:27.312
We're going to take over that watershed land.

12:27.592 --> 12:31.117
We're going to put in some emergency trenches, plant grass and trees.

12:31.578 --> 12:34.301
We're going to have a community forest here, believe me.

12:34.882 --> 12:37.866
We're going to tame the devil in Devil's Run.

12:37.886 --> 12:39.428
And we'll have you to thank for it.

12:39.929 --> 12:41.731
Well, that's fine, Mayor.

12:41.751 --> 12:47.479
But someday your children and their children will be thanking you for making Fairview a safer and happier and better place to live in.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.944
A community forest can do that, Mayor.

12:50.964 --> 12:52.266
Well, here comes Sam now.

12:52.286 --> 12:52.386
Look.

12:52.653 --> 12:54.696
Penny is opening her eyes.

12:54.856 --> 12:56.338
Oh, you're all right, Penny.

12:56.538 --> 12:57.419
Oh, there, there, Penny.

12:58.240 --> 12:58.941
Don't say a word.

12:58.961 --> 12:59.982
Just lie quietly.

13:00.002 --> 13:00.643
You'll be fine.

13:02.346 --> 13:02.906
All right, Mayor.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.028
Give me a hand here.

13:05.189 --> 13:07.352
June, you ride in front with me and old Penny.

13:08.053 --> 13:09.014
Sam, hop on and back.

13:09.094 --> 13:09.835
Right, Ranger Bill?

13:10.536 --> 13:13.139
Well, we're all set.

13:13.159 --> 13:13.760
So long, Mayor.

13:14.381 --> 13:15.242
Goodbye, Ranger.

13:16.183 --> 13:19.808
And God bless you.

13:26.335 --> 13:33.645
And so, Fairview has finally learned its lesson, and Mayor Arnold has taken it to heart.

13:33.665 --> 13:41.536
You have just heard the third in a new series of programs on forest conservation with Bill Scott's Forest Rangers.

13:41.556 --> 13:47.825
Don't fail to hear next week's story when our friends ride the range in search of a terrible killer on the loose.

13:48.846 --> 13:53.092
Ranger Bill's fine horse, Sparks, has a part in the adventure.

13:53.112 --> 13:54.975
Until then, adios,

13:55.411 --> 13:56.613
So long for a while.

13:57.694 --> 14:03.002
Bill Scott, forest ranger, comes to you with the cooperation of the Forest Service, U.S.

14:03.022 --> 14:04.124
Department of Agriculture.

14:04.805 --> 14:10.794
Bill Scott is written by Bill Burgorfen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokaw.

14:10.814 --> 14:13.858
Your narrator has been Al Riley.
