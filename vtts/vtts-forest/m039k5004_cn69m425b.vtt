WEBVTT

00:37.173 --> 00:41.058
Thank you, boys, thank you.

00:41.078 --> 00:42.220
Howdy, friends, how are y'all?

00:42.300 --> 00:54.235
Yes, here it is again, your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott and the Knothead, sitting here under the old pine tree, and we're going to play a few tunes for you, and we've got a few things we want to talk over with you about the woods, and first one thing and another.

00:54.536 --> 00:58.641
So just pull up the chair and make yourself comfortable there, and we'll do our best to

00:58.874 --> 00:59.415
Amuse you.

00:59.576 --> 01:00.077
Play for you.

01:00.097 --> 01:01.180
Here we go with the first tune.

01:01.220 --> 01:03.968
It features Bob Henderson, the fiddle player here.

01:03.988 --> 01:05.231
And he's going to do a hoedown.

01:06.655 --> 01:10.104
Charlie, if you let me have that bass fiddle, I'll do my best to play some of it.

01:10.124 --> 01:15.178
Bob Henderson's going to do a little thing called Sally Good.

01:28.692 --> 01:47.983
Oh, bring it up!

02:16.972 --> 02:17.793
Thank you, Bob.

02:17.853 --> 02:18.173
Thank you.

02:18.193 --> 02:20.836
There it was, friend, a little thing called Sally Gooden.

02:21.617 --> 02:22.979
You think I'm out of wind, don't you?

02:23.499 --> 02:24.801
Well, I ain't the wind out of me.

02:25.461 --> 02:33.790
You know, friends, this business of tree planting, tree planting, I wanted to talk over that situation with you, this tree planting.

02:33.810 --> 02:37.374
Now, there's a lot of people that are really interested in planting trees.

02:37.955 --> 02:42.480
The state nurses are really hard-pressed to supply all the tree demands.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.443
I mean, little trees for the people that want them.

02:46.334 --> 02:56.830
Now, there's one thing of planting trees, but another thing, just as important, is to protect them and keep them going until they get up where they can kind of take care of themselves.

02:57.711 --> 03:02.658
And so grazing won't hurt them and other things, for example.

03:02.678 --> 03:04.381
But fire, that's the thing.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.903
Now, that's the bad thing.

03:05.963 --> 03:07.866
That's the enemy, fire.

03:07.886 --> 03:09.508
Now, there was a lumber company.

03:09.548 --> 03:14.275
I know of a lumber company that is doing a lot of good planting in one part of the state.

03:14.856 --> 03:16.138
And there's another company.

03:16.574 --> 03:21.962
They had a lot of land that really needed tree planting, but they wasn't doing any planting.

03:21.982 --> 03:25.086
So I asked the woods boss why, how come they wasn't planting?

03:25.567 --> 03:37.284
And he told me that his company, along with a lot of others, that owners in that section, they was afraid to plant little trees because they were still having so many fires.

03:37.324 --> 03:42.852
For some reason or other that he didn't know why, they just was afraid to plant.

03:43.355 --> 03:44.336
Now, ain't that something?

03:44.576 --> 03:49.722
One section of the state was getting good money for pulpwood and paying good wages.

03:49.802 --> 03:55.948
Everybody was working, plenty of jobs, and they was really planting trees on their land and building it up.

03:56.309 --> 04:00.353
And right over there in the other section, well, it's a shame, ain't it?

04:00.734 --> 04:01.494
Don't you agree with me?

04:01.695 --> 04:02.035
Yes, sir?

04:02.455 --> 04:03.056
I do.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.518
I expect we better sing a song here.

04:04.718 --> 04:06.660
In fact, we, Ray Parker, that is.

04:06.700 --> 04:11.505
Ray's going to sing a pretty tune here, Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way.

04:12.160 --> 04:31.097
Now, darling, this is my desire To set your little old heart on fire And do the things that lovers always do So put your little hand in mine

04:41.607 --> 04:44.916
a little closer.

04:44.936 --> 04:49.910
Well, there ain't no use to stay so far away.

04:49.950 --> 04:53.559
I'd like to touch your lips through mine.

04:53.579 --> 04:57.490
I'd like to win your love divine and let old mother

05:12.860 --> 05:28.918
Now my baby, take a chance, cause I'm a achin' for old man.

05:29.118 --> 05:34.424
I know that you were meant for me to love.

05:34.444 --> 05:36.066
You know your heart is

06:08.260 --> 06:09.361
Thank you, Ray, thank you.

06:09.401 --> 06:12.045
I think that is mighty nicely done there, buddy.

06:12.065 --> 06:15.589
Yes, you know, friends, I'll just stand over there thinking.

06:15.609 --> 06:22.198
Here a while back, a friend of mine, Jim Lankford, he's a farm forester, and some folks call them service foresters.

06:22.598 --> 06:35.415
Well, me and him went out to school, a little school out in the country, and Jim give them kids a mighty nice talk on trees and what they meant in terms of money and protection and land from...

06:35.986 --> 06:42.231
all that erosion and everything, you know what all it meant, the shelter for the stock and all that sort of stuff.

06:43.092 --> 06:54.442
Well, at the end of Jim's talk, when he got through there, just before he got through rather, he reached in his pocket and he pulled out a real little live tree, a little bitty pine tree.

06:54.522 --> 06:57.645
I didn't even know he had it in his pocket, but he did.

06:57.665 --> 07:01.388
He had a real little live tree and he held it up high there where all the kids could see it.

07:02.028 --> 07:05.031
Nice little seedling there, I guess about three inches

07:05.298 --> 07:07.061
Now, that's mighty small, ain't it?

07:07.181 --> 07:08.523
But that's what he had in his pocket.

07:09.384 --> 07:16.755
And he held it up high, and he said to them kids, and he said, boys and girls, this little tree belongs to you.

07:16.775 --> 07:24.627
It don't matter whose land it grows on, and it'll mean real money to you if you're protected from fire.

07:24.647 --> 07:26.650
And I thought that meant a whole lot.

07:26.670 --> 07:30.636
That was covering a lot of territory, and it had a lot of meaning to it.

07:31.297 --> 07:33.600
And did you ever stop to think of that, friend?

07:33.884 --> 07:44.379
You can go into a section of the country where they have lots of timberland and everybody's working and there's a lot of jobs and everybody's on the payroll.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.162
And that means a whole lot.

07:46.202 --> 07:47.905
Just stop and think a minute what that meant.

07:47.965 --> 07:50.048
I think Jim had something there.

07:50.068 --> 07:53.974
And there was one little fella in the crowd there, one little fella in school.

07:54.955 --> 07:58.641
He carried his, he carried Jim's story home with him to his father.

07:59.462 --> 08:03.047
And he told the whole story and the

08:03.230 --> 08:09.997
It was a gospel, because this boy's father told Jim what happened, and Jim told me to pass it on to you friends out there.

08:11.638 --> 08:12.779
Oh, yeah, where was I now?

08:12.799 --> 08:13.120
Oh, yeah.

08:13.820 --> 08:19.866
Now, this little boy's daddy, he didn't impress too easily.

08:19.927 --> 08:27.174
He came from a long line of folks who believed it right and proper to burn the woods and all that sort of thing.

08:27.574 --> 08:31.498
Might do some good by killing boll weevils and snakes and ticks and

08:31.647 --> 08:57.823
rats and all that sort of thing now can you imagine that well anyway he believed in these things you know and this man told his little boy he said that any fire that he set out any fire he set out wouldn't hurt nothing and it wouldn't hurt anything and uh that his father ahead of him burned and his grandfather burned and his great grandfather burned and he figured he ought to burn too

08:58.563 --> 09:01.587
Well, I'm laughing, friends, but it's really not funny.

09:01.687 --> 09:02.428
It's funny in a way.

09:02.448 --> 09:04.831
In another way, it's not funny.

09:04.851 --> 09:10.478
Now, they burned the same land many, many years before him.

09:11.559 --> 09:14.503
Well, in a few days, the time was right.

09:14.523 --> 09:23.454
So this man, strong fire, crosses one side of his woods along the edge there and started to burn it.

09:23.494 --> 09:25.296
When the youngster come home from school,

09:25.748 --> 09:52.498
he run out there and looked the situation over right quick and he run out there ahead of the fire and scrambled around there and dug in the grass and his daddy was standing over there looking at him and he dug around in the grass a few minutes and fooled around and directly he got up and stood up kind of had a smile on his face and he went over to where his daddy was went right straight over to his daddy and uh he had still had this grin on his face and he told his daddy he says daddy

09:53.305 --> 09:56.628
He said, that fire may not hurt the big trees too much.

09:57.870 --> 09:59.692
And there are your trees.

09:59.952 --> 10:06.759
But in that grass is hiding these little trees that someday are going to be my trees.

10:06.779 --> 10:07.980
And here's one of them.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.226
And he pulled that little tree out of his pocket and showed it to his daddy.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.388
Well, I thought that was pretty cute.

10:15.408 --> 10:16.028
It really was.

10:16.048 --> 10:17.830
That little boy was thinking.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.672
That boy, that had impressed.

10:19.692 --> 10:22.435
What Jim had told him had impressed on his mind

10:22.887 --> 10:27.796
And right away, his daddy, he, I don't know, you know how the kids are.

10:27.876 --> 10:30.441
I got some of my own, and they can kind of get next to you.

10:30.501 --> 10:34.889
So his daddy got busy and got out there, and they put out the fire.

10:35.290 --> 10:37.955
And he stopped the fire from burning.

10:37.975 --> 10:43.746
Well, so friends, that little child done something there that me or probably nobody else could have done.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.431
And I think it's a wonderful thing.

10:46.968 --> 10:50.576
And that broke a bad, fire-setting habit of his daddy's.

10:50.596 --> 10:53.784
That was something that I guess me or nobody else could have done.

10:53.884 --> 10:55.508
I think that was mighty nice, don't you?

10:55.949 --> 10:59.818
Here's another tune, and Herman's going to play this on his little steel guitar.

10:59.838 --> 11:01.602
It's a little thing called Cracker Jacket.

11:47.752 --> 12:10.801
Well, thank you, Herman, thank you.

12:10.821 --> 12:14.146
You know, friends, I just can't get that story out of my mind.

12:14.466 --> 12:16.729
The little boy in the little pine tree there.

12:17.300 --> 12:21.726
You know, I guess it goes back to the old saying, the child will lead them.

12:22.447 --> 12:23.749
You know, that's a funny thing.

12:24.249 --> 12:29.136
Sometimes I look at the kids around these schools and I think how they're being mistreated.

12:29.196 --> 12:30.117
Have you ever thought of that?

12:30.598 --> 12:41.473
How the grown people will go out and carelessly let fire get out in the woods and burn up all the little trees and things that these kids are going to have to suffer for, that they're going to need after they grow up.

12:41.493 --> 12:44.016
Had you ever thought of it along that line?

12:44.182 --> 12:45.363
Well, that's something to think of.

12:45.383 --> 12:46.645
We've run out of time, friends.

12:46.665 --> 12:49.808
Before we go, here's just a little thought for the day I'd like to leave with you.

12:50.669 --> 12:55.635
Hidden in the grass are the little trees that can bring forests back on poor land.

12:56.196 --> 12:59.700
With protection from fire, they'll grow into cash.

12:59.720 --> 13:00.661
Come on now, friends.

13:00.861 --> 13:01.902
Lend nature a hand.

13:03.985 --> 13:05.727
All right.

13:05.747 --> 13:06.848
All right.

13:14.506 --> 13:17.910
Well, friends, that takes up all the time we've got today, but we'll be back with you.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.413
The local announcer will let you know the exact date.

13:21.094 --> 13:32.708
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:33.749 --> 13:38.816
Remember, friends, only you can prevent grass and woods fires.

13:38.836 --> 13:42.420
I love you.

14:08.962 --> 14:09.776
Thank you.
