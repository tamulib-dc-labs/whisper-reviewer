00:02.579 --> 00:06.227
Smokey the bear Smokey the bear

00:07.490 --> 00:08.812
Hello there, folks.

00:09.473 --> 00:12.797
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:13.338 --> 00:18.585
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:18.605 --> 00:23.251
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:23.692 --> 00:25.354
Today, it's Art Linkletter.

00:26.035 --> 00:29.539
Gee, Mr. Linkletter, thanks for inviting me to your house party.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.263
You sure have a lot of fun at these parties.

00:32.984 --> 00:36.028
We like to make people happy, Smokey, and to have fun.

00:36.481 --> 00:38.944
Sometimes, though, we do get serious.

00:38.964 --> 00:45.731
As you know, I talk with many little boys and girls, and lately I've been telling them about our beautiful forests and all the things we get from them.

00:46.051 --> 00:51.997
Wood for our homes and furniture, wood for the paper we write on, wood for the pencils we write with.

00:52.538 --> 01:00.987
Water to drink and to swim in and fish in, deer and squirrels and other wild things that give us so much enjoyment all come from the forests.

01:01.220 --> 01:05.626
The small trees in the forest are something like children, just as boys and girls are.

01:05.906 --> 01:07.248
They need a good start in life.

01:08.008 --> 01:09.911
Little trees need care and protection.

01:10.672 --> 01:13.435
The worst threat to these little trees is fire.

01:13.455 --> 01:15.197
In a forest fire, they don't have a chance.

01:15.898 --> 01:21.565
That's why, Smokey, I tell little boys and girls not to play with matches or with any fire.

01:21.986 --> 01:26.872
They can hurt themselves and burn the little trees in the forest if they fool around with matches.

01:26.892 --> 01:29.235
Little boys and girls should always keep this in mind.

01:29.705 --> 01:33.129
It takes only one tree to make a million matches.

01:33.149 --> 01:37.574
It takes only one match to destroy a million trees.

01:37.594 --> 01:38.755
Thanks, Mr. Linkletter.

01:39.316 --> 01:45.302
This kind of serious talk today can mean a lot of happiness for growing up boys and girls in years to come.

01:45.963 --> 01:54.312
Talking about trees, my friends here, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a beautiful song about a tree, a redwood tree.

01:57.734 --> 02:10.506
Here in the hush of the redwood trees.

02:10.526 --> 02:23.418
Here where the ages pass.

02:23.438 --> 02:26.121
Here in

02:29.392 --> 02:50.286
of the redwood trees here where there's peace at last see

02:50.789 --> 03:14.410
See how they raised their lofty heads and see how they've learned to pray.

03:14.430 --> 03:18.754
God must have stood

03:19.628 --> 03:47.543
Where I'm standing now and talked With the redwood tree Like he talks with me

03:52.518 --> 03:54.840
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.602
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:57.622 --> 04:02.827
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:02.867 --> 04:09.072
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:09.092 --> 04:22.103
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember...

04:22.572 --> 04:26.957
Only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:26.977 --> 04:35.648
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowling and a-growling and a-slip in the air.

04:36.309 --> 04:40.253
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:40.614 --> 04:44.939
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:44.939 --> 05:05.692
