Smokey the bear Smokey the bear Hello there, folks. This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear. Those singing 
friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you. But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big

00:18.605 --> 00:23.251
star? Today, it's Art Linkletter. Gee, Mr. Linkletter, thanks for inviting me to your house party. You sure have a lot of 
fun at these parties. We like to make people happy, Smokey, and to have fun. Sometimes, though, we do get serious. As you

00:38.964 --> 00:45.731
know, I talk with many little boys and girls, and lately I've been telling them about our beautiful forests and all the 
things we get from them. Wood for our homes and furniture, wood for the paper we write on, wood for the pencils we write

00:46.051 --> 00:51.997
with. Water to drink and to swim in and fish in, deer and squirrels and other wild things that give us so much enjoyment all 
come from the forests. The small trees in the forest are something like children, just as boys and girls are. They need a

01:05.906 --> 01:07.248
good start in life. Little trees need care and protection. The worst threat to these little trees is fire. In a forest 
fire, they don't have a chance. That's why, Smokey, I tell little boys and girls not to play with matches or with any fire.

01:21.986 --> 01:26.872
They can hurt themselves and burn the little trees in the forest if they fool around with matches. Little boys and girls 
should always keep this in mind. It takes only one tree to make a million matches. It takes only one match to destroy a

01:33.149 --> 01:37.574
million trees. Thanks, Mr. Linkletter. This kind of serious talk today can mean a lot of happiness for growing up boys 
and girls in years to come. Talking about trees, my friends here, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a beautiful song about a

01:45.963 --> 01:54.312
tree, a redwood tree.

01:57.734 --> 02:10.506
Here in the hush

01:57.734 --> 02:10.506
of the redwood trees.

02:10.526 --> 02:23.418
Here where the ages pass.

02:23.438 --> 02:26.121
Here in

02:29.392 --> 02:50.286
of the redwood trees

02:29.392 --> 02:50.286
here where there's peace at last

02:29.392 --> 02:50.286
see See how they raised their lofty

02:50.789 --> 03:14.410
heads and see how they've

02:50.789 --> 03:14.410
learned to pray.

03:14.430 --> 03:18.754
God must have stood Where I'm standing

03:19.628 --> 03:47.543
now and talked With the redwood

03:19.628 --> 03:47.543
tree

03:19.628 --> 03:47.543
Like he talks with me

03:52.518 --> 03:54.840
Well, that's it for now, folks. Thanks a lot for spending this time with us. You know, it's your own State Forestry 
Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that

04:02.867 --> 04:09.072
make these get-togethers possible. Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, 
this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember... Only you can prevent forest and

04:22.572 --> 04:26.957
woods fires. Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowling and a-growling and a-slip in the air. He can find the fire before 
it starts to flame. That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:49.765 --> 04:49.845
Ooh.

04:53.639 --> 05:01.692
Thank

04:53.639 --> 05:01.692
you.
