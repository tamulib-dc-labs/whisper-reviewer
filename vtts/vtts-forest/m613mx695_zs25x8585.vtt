WEBVTT

00:34.321 --> 00:35.943
Thank you, boys.

00:35.963 --> 00:36.543
Thank you.

00:36.563 --> 00:37.124
Howdy, friends.

00:37.144 --> 00:37.685
How are y'all?

00:38.466 --> 00:39.727
George, glad to see you today.

00:40.388 --> 00:43.271
Yes, it's time again for Jelly Elliot and the Three Knothead.

00:43.291 --> 00:52.021
We're sitting here under the old pine tree, friends, with our fiddles and guitars and what have you here, and we're going to play some tunes for you in just a few minutes.

00:52.621 --> 00:57.747
We think maybe you'll like this program we've got lined up for you today, so just drag up a chair there and relax and

00:57.980 --> 00:59.041
Set a spell with us.

00:59.061 --> 01:02.845
We're going to talk a little bit about the woods, first one thing or another.

01:03.245 --> 01:07.970
But to get the program really started off with a bang here, we're going to bring Jack up.

01:07.990 --> 01:14.797
Jack, our champion, hold-down fiddle player, and he's doing an old-timer called Fire on the Mountain Jive.

01:14.817 --> 01:23.025
Oh, baby, I want you.

01:23.005 --> 01:25.047
Get on up there.

01:25.207 --> 01:50.852
Yeah.

01:56.114 --> 02:25.041
I'll tell you, sir, I'm going to make the first floor stop.

02:26.945 --> 02:55.568
The End

02:55.700 --> 03:06.593
Well, thank you there, Jack.

03:06.613 --> 03:07.794
That is a fine job.

03:07.814 --> 03:10.878
That's what I call real hoedown fiddle playing, friends.

03:11.298 --> 03:12.980
And we do hope that you enjoyed it.

03:13.481 --> 03:18.206
Now, friends, if you ain't doing nothing for a few minutes, I got something here I'd just like to talk over with you.

03:18.807 --> 03:19.808
And I want you to hear it.

03:20.429 --> 03:21.370
It's really amazing.

03:21.923 --> 03:30.938
You take out in the forest of the Rocky Mountains in the west and in the northwest, there's a lot of forest fires out there start from lightning.

03:30.958 --> 03:33.382
Now, that's not the case here in the south.

03:33.403 --> 03:37.750
Right here in the south, friends, nearly all the fires in the woods are man-cold.

03:38.491 --> 03:40.334
And they're not all by carelessness either.

03:41.015 --> 03:46.665
Friends, we've got a record here in the south for more deliberate burnings.

03:46.898 --> 03:49.661
of the woods than anywhere in the country.

03:49.681 --> 03:51.383
Now, ain't you ashamed of that?

03:51.403 --> 03:52.063
I am.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.685
That makes me feel mighty bad.

03:54.266 --> 03:54.886
It really does.

03:55.407 --> 03:57.869
The South has got a record.

03:57.889 --> 04:06.298
Us Southerners has got a record here of more deliberate setting the woods on fire than any other place in the country.

04:06.318 --> 04:08.660
I'm really ashamed of it, and I know you are.

04:09.721 --> 04:16.348
And to tell you the truth and be honest about it, I was sort of surprised when I learned this, too, and I

04:16.582 --> 04:19.126
Figured maybe some of you out there would be.

04:19.146 --> 04:26.918
And I'll guarantee you that it makes me want to work even harder than I have worked in the past to keep fire out of the woods.

04:26.938 --> 04:31.746
Because, you know, friends, us southerners down here, we kind of got to stick together.

04:31.766 --> 04:39.077
I tell you, friends, this deliberate, intentional burning out in the woods is a mighty bad thing.

04:39.097 --> 04:42.102
That's where people just go out and set fire to the woods just for meanness.

04:42.122 --> 04:43.304
They slip around.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.766
They're a coward to start with.

04:45.185 --> 04:50.290
deep down inside their coward, because if they wasn't, why would they slip around to do these things?

04:50.330 --> 05:00.100
They go out and do them at night, and they'll figure out all kinds of ways to set the woods on fire and not be on the scene when the fire boys get there to try to put it out.

05:00.561 --> 05:11.532
Sometimes they get it in for the fire boys, or they get sore at somebody or something, and they go out and burn the woods off, which is an ignorant thing to do, because after all, he's biting a hen that feeds him.

05:12.073 --> 05:14.415
Nine out of ten's got children they're raising a family.

05:15.037 --> 05:17.802
And in turn, them poor little old kids will have to suffer for it.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.228
Friends, this intentional burning really gets my go.

05:21.769 --> 05:22.390
It really does.

05:23.032 --> 05:25.917
Just deliberately stepping on fire.

05:26.658 --> 05:33.070
More than half of the fires in our woods today is caused from just deliberate setting the woods on fire.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.236
Now, we've got to stop that, friends.

05:36.977 --> 05:38.580
Now, we can't do nothing about lightning.

05:40.265 --> 05:45.499
But we just got to see God's light and quit this deliberate setting the woods on fire.

05:45.519 --> 05:48.547
Here we go with the next tune, and Lewis is going to sing this one.

05:49.128 --> 05:51.976
It's a mighty putty tune, gets a lot of requests for it.

05:51.996 --> 05:53.039
Lewis does a good job.

05:53.079 --> 05:55.084
Here it is, it's called Crossroads.

06:03.856 --> 06:08.226
I'm standing at the crossroads.

06:08.246 --> 06:12.315
I'll go the way the wind blows.

06:12.696 --> 06:18.709
What you say will show the way to me.

06:20.613 --> 06:29.084
I'm asking for the last time for you to say you'll be mine.

06:29.104 --> 06:37.555
Your answer, dear, will make it clear to see.

06:37.575 --> 06:44.764
And if you say we're through, then I'll stop loving you.

06:46.718 --> 06:53.089
Oh, I'll find someone who'll bring me peace of mind.

06:53.670 --> 06:57.757
So please say yes or no, dear.

06:57.958 --> 07:02.245
That's all I want to know, dear.

07:02.265 --> 07:06.332
I'm standing at the crossroad.

07:06.633 --> 07:09.638
Which way do I go?

07:23.422 --> 07:50.661
And if you say the truth Then I'll stop loving you

07:53.830 --> 07:55.151
fine.

07:55.392 --> 07:59.997
Someone who'll bring me peace of mind.

08:00.017 --> 08:04.001
So please say yes or no, dear.

08:04.342 --> 08:08.366
That's all I want to know, dear.

08:08.667 --> 08:13.152
I'm standing at the crossroads.

08:13.172 --> 08:17.416
Which way do I go?

08:20.360 --> 08:20.980
Thank you, Lewis.

08:21.020 --> 08:21.361
Thank you.

08:21.381 --> 08:22.682
That's mighty nice job there.

08:22.762 --> 08:23.483
Crossroads.

08:23.750 --> 08:24.751
I'm pretty tuned.

08:24.791 --> 08:25.592
I sort of like that.

08:25.612 --> 08:26.574
Didn't you like it, friend?

08:27.895 --> 08:33.442
Well, friends, we was talking about lightning in the West and that sort of stuff.

08:33.462 --> 08:36.346
Well, we can't do much about lightning.

08:36.886 --> 08:38.168
We know that.

08:38.188 --> 08:42.073
But we sure can about this deliberate setting the woods on fire.

08:42.093 --> 08:42.674
By hand.

08:44.235 --> 08:45.557
Now, we can do something about that.

08:45.597 --> 08:51.124
You know, it seems a shame that the law has to come in and take part on this thing.

08:51.644 --> 08:55.970
and chase around after these folks that slip around and set the woods on fire.

08:56.571 --> 09:14.715
It'd be much better if they'd change their ways themselves and wake up and come to their senses, because you take the people here in the South, they're all sensible people, and they know when they're doing wrong, when they're doing right, and there's no need for anything like that.

09:15.843 --> 09:16.624
And you know it.

09:16.664 --> 09:17.786
You can feel it yourself.

09:17.826 --> 09:24.215
You know just as well when you go out there to do something like this, you can feel something pulling you back, telling you not to do it.

09:24.235 --> 09:24.856
Don't do that.

09:24.996 --> 09:25.477
Don't do it.

09:26.438 --> 09:30.805
But still, you'll force yourself on and go on out and do it.

09:30.825 --> 09:32.467
Friends, we just got to stop that.

09:33.228 --> 09:37.795
If not for your own sake, if you don't care nothing about yourself, think of the kids.

09:37.815 --> 09:40.178
We want them to have things better than we're having.

09:40.719 --> 09:44.905
I know I want my kids to enjoy things and have

09:45.138 --> 09:46.700
Better and more than I've had.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.765
And I know you feel the same way about your kids.

09:50.526 --> 09:53.111
If you don't have kids, about your friend's kids.

09:54.893 --> 10:00.222
And I know that a man knows when he's doing wrong because I have done things wrong and I knew it when I was doing it.

10:01.003 --> 10:04.328
And I know there's a lot of you out there the same way.

10:04.348 --> 10:06.371
It's come to the point where they've got bloodhounds.

10:06.392 --> 10:09.897
They often bring them in to track these fellas down.

10:10.417 --> 10:13.301
And he'll try to cover up his tracks.

10:13.962 --> 10:17.988
You know, I'll just bet you a guy that does those sort of things, I'll bet you he sleeps awful.

10:18.528 --> 10:20.311
I'll bet he rolls and tumbles all night.

10:21.012 --> 10:23.916
He ought to, but I know his conscience is bothering him.

10:24.697 --> 10:26.700
If it's not, it should.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.102
It just ain't no good, friends.

10:28.723 --> 10:35.753
Not for the man who does it, his kids, his wife, his community, the South as a whole, or the woods, industry, or nothing.

10:35.773 --> 10:38.196
There's nothing that gets any good out of burning the woods.

10:38.682 --> 10:39.583
You just can't win.

10:39.623 --> 10:40.624
You haven't got a chance to win.

10:42.265 --> 10:46.489
Friends, we can't blame it on lightning for these fires here in the south.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.471
We just got to look closer to earth.

10:49.152 --> 10:55.918
We got to look to ourselves and throw a cold eye on these fellas that just deliberately set the woods on fire.

10:56.939 --> 10:57.840
And we got to stop it.

10:58.981 --> 11:04.326
These fellas that set the woods on fire for their own selfish reasons and all that sort of stuff, we got to wake them up.

11:04.386 --> 11:05.627
You help me and I'll help you.

11:06.367 --> 11:06.968
And let's do it.

11:07.201 --> 11:10.150
Here we'll go to the next tune, and Herman's going to play this one.

11:10.170 --> 11:10.953
Herman Popliss.

11:11.735 --> 11:15.327
He's going to do a steel tune here called The Steel Boogie, Herman.

11:15.848 --> 11:18.055
The Steel Boogie

11:51.785 --> 12:05.001
¶¶

12:32.386 --> 12:46.782
Thank you, Herman.

12:46.802 --> 12:49.706
That's what I call mighty fine steel playing there, son.

12:50.106 --> 12:53.710
And I know a lot of our friends out there really enjoyed that tune a whole lot.

12:55.012 --> 12:57.535
We enjoyed playing it for you, friends.

12:57.555 --> 12:59.577
Well, neighbors, let me get out my old watch here and see.

13:00.358 --> 13:01.039
Friends have got to go.

13:01.059 --> 13:02.140
We've run out of time here.

13:02.474 --> 13:05.939
But before I go, here's just a little thought I'd like to leave with you.

13:06.439 --> 13:10.545
You can sort of turn it over there in your head and see what you think about it.

13:10.565 --> 13:16.532
It's our own hands that kill the trees, fish, and game, and start forest fires that are so frightening.

13:17.393 --> 13:23.682
So let's put the blame where it belongs, my friend, on ourselves, you and me, not on lightning.

13:25.204 --> 13:25.324
Ho!

13:25.344 --> 13:27.807
Ho, ho, ho!

13:39.127 --> 13:46.434
Well, friends, there it is all through today, but we'll be coming your way again soon.

13:46.854 --> 13:50.157
Listen to your local announcer and he'll let you know when.

13:50.177 --> 14:00.728
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own state forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

14:01.428 --> 14:05.472
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fires.
