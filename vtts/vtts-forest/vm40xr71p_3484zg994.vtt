00:04.891 --> 00:08.937
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:09.918 --> 00:11.340
Hello there, folks.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.945
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:15.285 --> 00:20.432
Those singing friends of mine, the sons of the pioneers, have a song for you.

00:20.753 --> 00:26.140
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:26.120 --> 00:35.792
Today, it's that wonderful fella they call Jingles, Mr. Andy Devine, who knows why it's so important to be careful with fire.

00:36.172 --> 00:37.133
Hello, Smokey.

00:37.394 --> 00:38.215
Hi, fella.

00:38.675 --> 00:43.821
You know, I spend a lot of my time out of doors on the range and in the woods.

00:43.841 --> 00:51.030
I've seen what can happen when fellas aren't careful, especially in clearing new ground and burning brush.

00:51.500 --> 01:04.826
I've seen brush-burning fires get away and run wild, killing little trees and damaging the big ones, destroying their nests of birds and wildlife, messing up the land generally.

01:04.846 --> 01:10.757
Well, it's not too tough to be careful if we just remember to be careful.

01:10.906 --> 01:21.165
You know, it's a good idea if you're going to burn brush or any debris to pick a time late in the day when the weather's not too dry and the wind is down.

01:21.185 --> 01:24.571
Plow or scrape a safety line around the brush pile.

01:25.052 --> 01:28.899
Have plenty of tools, water, help handy.

01:28.919 --> 01:31.363
And always check the local laws on burning.

01:31.904 --> 01:32.425
Say...

01:32.928 --> 01:35.834
Talking about the law, there goes Wild Bill.

01:36.255 --> 01:38.860
Hey, Wild Bill, wait for me.

01:39.241 --> 01:40.484
Hold on, Andy.

01:40.504 --> 01:43.270
The sons of the pioneer here want a word with you.

01:43.290 --> 01:47.258
Well, Andy, now, before you head out, we'd like to tell you about the Cherokee Strip.

01:50.900 --> 02:15.928
In old Oklahoma they tell of a land That's famous for lizards and white diamond sand. They climb for their water 
and dig for their wood On ten million acres that ain't any good. Come along with me to a land that is fair, Where 
the ants and the grasshoppers nest in your hair. They drink from a jug and they shoot from the hip

02:15.908 --> 02:19.434
And they have lots of fun on the Cherokee Strip.

02:19.755 --> 02:28.890
Come a-tie-ie, yippee-i-o-t-o-t-e-ay, i-o-t-o-t-e-ay.

02:28.910 --> 02:32.556
It's hotter than blazes from morning till night.

02:32.596 --> 02:35.822
The prairie dog bark in the sand, it can't bite.

02:36.303 --> 02:39.368
In all of the desert, this land is the worst. Where hornet toads starve and snakes die of thirst. 

02:39.770 --> 02:57.398
Come a-tie-ie, yippee-i-o-t-o-t-e-ay, i-o-t-o-t-e-ay. I bought me a section of cactus and sage, an old old be shanty that's battered with age.

02:57.879 --> 03:04.630
Give me a bushel of corn and a plow, and I'll be rich hungry in ten years from now.

03:04.610 --> 03:28.356
Come a-tie-ie, yippee-i-o-t-o-t-e-ay, i-o-t-o-t-e-ay. Whenever I die you can bury my bones And cover me over with Malapai stones 
And right on my tombstone he came here to stay But he never stopped wishing he'd have died on the way

03:30.580 --> 03:55.390
Come a-tie-ie, yippee-i-o-t-o-t-e-ay, i-o-t-o-t-e-ay. This wonderful country of pleasure and ease I'm always so hungry I'm weak in the knees. 
With sand in my whiskers and holes in my clothes, how I keep living, the lord only knows. Come a-tie-ie, yippee-i-o-t-o-t-e-ay, i-o-t-o-t-e-ay.

04:00.533 --> 04:07.305
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:07.325 --> 04:12.914
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:12.954 --> 04:19.065
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:19.366 --> 04:36.131
So until we can say hello there again and pay another little visit with another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the sons of the pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and range fires.

04:36.552 --> 04:40.918
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

04:41.185 --> 04:45.356
prowling and a-growling and a-slip in the air.

04:45.938 --> 04:50.029
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:50.430 --> 04:55.043
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:55.043 --> 05:02.000
