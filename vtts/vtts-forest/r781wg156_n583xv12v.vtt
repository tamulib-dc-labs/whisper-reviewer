00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
[Silence.]

00:19.000 --> 00:28:000
[Music.]

00:28:000 --> 00:36.917
Once again, the Texas Forest Service brings you 15 minutes with Charlie Adams and his Western All-Stars.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.059
Howdy, friends and neighbors.

00:38.079 --> 00:43.048
This is John Scoggin, and here to start off the program is Charlie and the boys with I Get So Lonely.

00:43.048 --> 00:50.352
[Music.]

00:50.352 --> 00:54.761
Baby, man, I get so lonely when I dream about you.

00:55.242 --> 00:56.645
Can't do without you.

00:57.146 --> 00:59.109
That's why I dream about you.

00:59.130 --> 01:05.823
If I could only put my arms about you, life would be so fair.

01:05.843 --> 01:08.428
If you were there, we two could hug and kiss it.

01:08.408 --> 01:14.038
Never tire, I'm on fire, you are my one desire.

01:14.418 --> 01:20.609
I get so lonely when I dream about you, why can't you be there?

01:21.751 --> 01:28.442
Tossing and turning in my slumber, holding you is seen.

01:28.422 --> 01:36.289
I give you kisses without number, but only in my dreams.

01:36.309 --> 01:40.573
Oh, baby, mine, I get so lonely when I dream about you.

01:40.593 --> 01:42.514
I can't do without you.

01:42.534 --> 01:44.936
That's why I dream about you.

01:44.956 --> 01:50.108
If I could only put my arms about you, life would be so fair.

01:50.108 --> 02:28.000
[Music.]

02:28.000 --> 02:34.490
Baby, man, I get so lonely when I dream about you. 

02:34.490 --> 02:38.490
Can't do without you. That's why I dream about you. 

02:38.490 --> 02:43.398
If I could only put my arms about you, life would be so fair.

02:43.398 --> 02:50.067
If you were there, we too could hug and kiss and never tire.

02:50.828 --> 02:52.050
I'm on fire.

02:52.490 --> 02:54.113
You are my one desire.

02:54.493 --> 02:57.918
I get so lonely when I dream about you.

02:58.318 --> 03:01.903
Why can't you be there?

03:02.923 --> 03:08.253
Tossing and turning in my slumber, all in you it seems.

03:10.571 --> 03:16.820
I give you kisses without number, but only in my dreams.

03:17.840 --> 03:22.245
Oh, baby, man, I get so lonely when I dream about you.

03:22.006 --> 03:23.187
Can't do without you.

03:23.627 --> 03:25.670
That's why I dream about you.

03:25.690 --> 03:32.418
If I could only put my arms about you, life would be so fair. Yeah!

03:35.521 --> 03:39.426
Hey, John, quit fooling around with that radio and come over here and announce this program.

03:39.794 --> 03:40.797
Don't you know we're on there?

03:41.980 --> 03:42.481
Woodville.

03:42.822 --> 03:43.885
I'm now over Livingston.

03:44.347 --> 03:46.312
Smoke about five miles east of Carter.

03:46.773 --> 03:48.277
Any reports in that area on fire?

03:48.337 --> 03:49.461
Over.

03:49.481 --> 03:51.526
6-7 Charlie will check with the crew leader.

03:51.546 --> 03:51.987
Stand by.

03:52.008 --> 03:53.652
4-2-8 Woodville.

03:57.496 --> 04:01.480
Watkins, our pilot reports spotting a fire from the air about five miles east of Corrigan.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.962
What in the world are you listening to, John?

04:04.382 --> 04:12.430
Well, Charlie, that's one of the Texas Forest Service Air Patrol pilots reporting into district headquarters that he spotted a possible forest fire.

04:14.192 --> 04:15.613
Stand by while the pilot makes a check.

04:16.033 --> 04:16.934
It may be a wildfire.

04:16.954 --> 04:18.295
I sure didn't know that.

04:18.315 --> 04:19.677
Now what happened?

04:20.017 --> 04:20.718
Well, listen.

04:20.738 --> 04:21.098
Let's see.

04:21.999 --> 04:22.419
Roger.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.660
I'll check on it.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.521
6-7, Charlie.

04:24.822 --> 04:25.502
Over.

04:25.642 --> 04:26.423
KKB-828.

04:26.487 --> 04:30.432
Looks like we must have found one all right, but they'll take care of it in a hurry.

04:31.013 --> 04:34.317
You mean he'll put out the fire just from his airplane?

04:34.357 --> 04:38.042
Well, no, Charlie, but he will help the crew leader on the ground spot it in a hurry.

04:38.583 --> 04:45.252
Say, that is pretty slick, but I never knew the Texas Forest Service used airplanes to hunt forest fires.

04:45.712 --> 04:48.616
Always thought they used lookout towers in the woods.

04:48.636 --> 04:53.963
Well, they do use towers some, Charlie, but now they're making more and more use of airplanes.

04:54.095 --> 05:01.705
It's quicker and more accurate and cheaper to use airplanes for such work, and when visibility is poor from the towers, they're almost a must.

05:02.506 --> 05:14.863
And, Charlie, not only do they use airplanes, but they also use about every other modern forest fire detection and suppression method, like jeeps and tractors, two-way radios, and a lot of other things that I don't even know about.

05:15.364 --> 05:19.509
Why, one of these days, they'll probably be using television to watch for fires.

05:19.529 --> 05:20.210
No fooling.

05:20.691 --> 05:22.313
Well, that's downright interesting.

05:22.630 --> 05:24.472
Say, how about telling me more about it, John?

05:24.492 --> 05:25.393
Well, I'll tell you what.

05:25.433 --> 05:33.363
You go ahead and play a tune for the folks, and I'll listen in on this Texas Forest Service radio and see what the pilot finds out about that fire he's checking.

05:33.863 --> 05:36.166
All right, I guess we'll play that old number title.

05:36.186 --> 05:37.587
6-7, Charlie.

05:37.607 --> 05:39.349
6-7, Charlie.

05:39.390 --> 05:40.030
Go ahead, Wendell.

05:42.193 --> 05:44.375
I'm over the fire now.

05:44.395 --> 05:47.519
It's only about a half acre in size, but it's spreading fast.

05:47.919 --> 05:50.983
Looks like it caught from one of the farmer's fields where it was burning brush.

05:51.301 --> 05:55.767
Location is block 843, grid A, able B, under the 3.

05:56.908 --> 05:57.970
Roger, 6-7, Charlie.

05:58.210 --> 06:00.253
I'll get Tom on the job right away.

06:00.273 --> 06:01.394
Over to 4-2-8, Woodville.

06:01.855 --> 06:02.776
4-2-8, Woodville.

06:03.056 --> 06:03.477
Go ahead.

06:04.438 --> 06:07.142
Watkins says the fire's a small one but spreading fast.

06:07.162 --> 06:14.632
You see there, Charlie, only two or three minutes from the time the pilot first spotted the smoke and the firefighting crew is on its way now.

06:14.652 --> 06:14.912
Yep.

06:15.230 --> 06:18.278
Man, with these airplanes and radio, it doesn't take long.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.922
It sure beats the old way, doesn't it?

06:19.942 --> 06:21.005
You're so right.

06:21.025 --> 06:23.091
Now, what about that song you were going to play?

06:23.311 --> 06:25.337
Gosh, yes, I plumb forgot all about it.

06:25.597 --> 06:30.049
Well, here's an old one called Way Down Yonder with Red on the piano, and here it is.

06:30.049 --> 08:21.220
[Music.]

08:21.220 --> 08:24.136
Well, yes, sir.

08:24.156 --> 08:28.623
You know, Charlie, I hate to tell you this, but I'm actually beginning to like your music.

08:29.084 --> 08:30.386
Well, thanks a lot, John.

08:30.426 --> 08:35.353
Man, if that's coming from you, you know, that amounts to about a full-size compliment.

08:35.373 --> 08:35.894
Yes, sir.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.496
I think I'm beginning to like it.

08:37.516 --> 08:41.202
So while I'm feeling this away, how about another little song?

08:41.452 --> 08:43.981
Do you know I'll Tickle Your Toesies?

08:44.001 --> 08:44.623
Do we know it?

08:44.643 --> 08:51.867
Well, then, that's one of our Columbia records.

08:56.622 --> 09:02.248
I'll tickle your toes when we rub our noses tonight under the moon.

09:03.489 --> 09:08.815
You would say, baby, let's get ready for the honeymoon.

09:10.276 --> 09:15.982
It'll be thrilling if you're willing when we build and cool.

09:16.002 --> 09:21.728
Cause I'll tickle your toes when we rub our noses tonight under the moon.

09:22.449 --> 09:25.532
Now I never went to high school.

09:25.698 --> 09:32.767
And I never went to college, but I'm a loving fool.

09:32.787 --> 09:35.170
And that don't take any knowledge.

09:36.032 --> 09:39.496
I'll tickle your toes when we rub our noses.

09:39.596 --> 09:41.859
You just wait and see.

09:42.740 --> 09:48.668
The love you've been saving is a kind I've been craving, cause you're the one for me.

09:48.668 --> 10:16.550
[Music.]

10:16.550 --> 10:23.447
I'll tickle your toes when we rub our noses tonight under the moon

10:24.305 --> 10:29.473
The love you've been saving is a kind of been craving, is a kind of been craving.

10:29.593 --> 10:33.118
I can't get started too soon.

10:33.138 --> 10:39.167
It'll be thrilling if you're willing when we build it cool.

10:39.187 --> 10:45.876
Cause I'll tickle your toes when we rub our noses tonight under the moon.

10:45.896 --> 10:52.506
Now I never went to high school and I never went to college.

10:52.992 --> 10:58.900
But I'm a lovin' fool, and that don't take any knowledge.

10:59.702 --> 11:06.411
I'll tickle your toes, but when we rub our noses, you just wait and see.

11:06.431 --> 11:11.719
The love you've been savin' is a kind I've been cravin', cause you're the one for me.

11:15.044 --> 11:18.088
Yeah, ho, a good toesy!

11:18.288 --> 11:23.715
Well, Charlie, would you like to know something about how the Texas Forest Service uses airplanes to spot forest fires?

11:23.855 --> 11:24.296
How about that?

11:24.416 --> 11:25.497
I sure would, John.

11:25.537 --> 11:36.611
Well, Charlie, it all started back in the spring of 1943 when the Texas Forest Service and the Civil Air Patrol put their heads together and decided to try patrolling the forest with an airplane.

11:36.631 --> 11:37.933
And it seemed like a good idea.

11:38.013 --> 11:44.921
So for about 42 hours, Texas Forest Service observers flew with the CAP pilots to try it out.

11:44.941 --> 11:46.303
And the trial was successful.

11:46.722 --> 11:49.986
And it was economical, too, so a full-scale test was set up.

11:50.666 --> 11:58.655
An active unit of CAP was organized on January 4, 1944, and nine planes were made available to the CAP.

11:58.675 --> 12:01.779
Two-way radios were borrowed from the Army Air Force.

12:01.799 --> 12:08.186
They were installed in the airplanes, and the first full-scale aerial patrol of our Texas forests got underway.

12:08.206 --> 12:11.970
And during the next 14 months, this patrol flew 1,000 hours.

12:12.389 --> 12:17.717
That was just the beginning, and from that start has grown the Texas Forest Service's own aerial patrol.

12:18.458 --> 12:25.828
Several radio-equipped airplanes are now owned by the Forest Service, and the pilots are regular employees of the service.

12:25.849 --> 12:34.301
Other airplanes are under contract, and during this year, these planes will fly several times the number of hours of patrol as was flown that first year.

12:34.942 --> 12:39.308
That original test has now become a full-scale standard operation.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.304
Well, thanks for the information.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.026
I sure didn't know about that.

12:43.046 --> 12:50.795
And I don't have to ask if it works, but just a few minutes ago, well, then we heard those airplanes will then report all those fires.

12:50.815 --> 12:58.263
And as I circled the area, I saw the tom that plowed a fire lane all the way around, and is now completely under control.

12:58.283 --> 12:59.345
Roger, 6-7, Charlie.

12:59.725 --> 13:01.187
Continue your patrol.

13:01.207 --> 13:01.687
Will do.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.891
There's smoke about 20 miles northeast of here.

13:04.911 --> 13:08.215
We'll investigate and report 6-7, Charlie, over and out.

13:08.279 --> 13:10.047
Yes, it really works, Charlie.

13:10.549 --> 13:13.381
And speaking of work, it's time that you did some.

13:13.441 --> 13:14.526
So play, Charlie.

13:26.285 --> 13:38.227
You've heard one of the ways your Texas Forest Service helps to protect your forests, but in spite of their use of the latest, most modern methods of detection and suppression of forest fires, they still need your help.

13:38.929 --> 13:45.561
Be sure to break your match, use your ashtray, crush your smokes, and be sure your campfires are dead out.

13:46.202 --> 13:49.288
Remember, only you can prevent forest fires.

13:54.652 --> 14:01.904
Charlie Adams and his Western All-Stars have been presented by the Texas Forest Service, a part of the Texas A&M College System.

14:01.924 --> 14:08.876
The program was written and produced by Chester O'Donnell and has been brought to you as a public service feature.

14:08.896 --> 14:09.752
Your announcer has been John Scoggin.

14:09.752 --> 14:20.752
[Music.]
