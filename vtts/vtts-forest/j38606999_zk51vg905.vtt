Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear Hello there, folks.

00:17.391 --> 00:20.515
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:21.076 --> 00:26.123
Those singing friends of mine, the sons of the pioneers, have a song for you.

00:26.143 --> 00:29.988
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:30.428 --> 00:34.613
Today, it's that wonderful fella everybody loves, Walter Brennan.

00:35.374 --> 00:36.356
Hello, Mr. Brennan.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.138
Hello yourself there, young fella.

00:38.911 --> 00:42.556
Say, you look a lot like that talking bear folks call Smokey.

00:42.576 --> 00:46.340
He wears those blue jeans and that ranger's hat there, too.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.002
You can't be, though.

00:48.022 --> 00:50.025
Smokey Bear's got no reason to come visiting me.

00:51.046 --> 00:56.333
Why, I'm one of the carefulest fellas in the world when it comes to smoking or using fire of any kind in the woods or near them.

00:57.855 --> 01:01.199
You might not guess at the look at me, but I own some timber.

01:01.219 --> 01:03.822
And I've seen what happens when someone lets fires get out.

01:04.882 --> 01:07.345
I've seen how wildfire can kill the little trees.

01:07.765 --> 01:08.967
Why, they just don't have a chance.

01:09.948 --> 01:15.735
And how it can kill the damaged big trees, too, and destroy the homes of the wild things, like the birds and the squirrels and the like.

01:17.137 --> 01:26.788
Yes, sir, I know what wildfire can do, and if I catch anyone around my woods not being careful with fire, why, I'll... Say, who are you, anyway, and what's your business with me?

01:27.190 --> 01:29.616
You better speak up, son, because I've got to be heading down the canyon.

01:29.917 --> 01:31.701
I am Smokey Bear, Mr. Brennan.

01:31.982 --> 01:37.094
I came visiting just to thank you for being one of the carefullest fellers in the world.

01:37.115 --> 01:41.385
How about letting the sons of the pioneers here go riding down the canyon with you?

01:52.537 --> 02:08.807
chores are over at our ranch house on the plains and all I've got to do is lay around

02:09.445 --> 02:31.318
I saddle up my pony and go riding down the trail to watch the desert sun go down.

02:31.378 --> 02:31.538
Riding

02:32.395 --> 03:00.917
Down the canyon to watch the sun go down A picture that no artist e'er could paint Ooh, white-faced Cataloan on the mountainside

03:01.555 --> 03:12.506
I hear a coyote whining for its mane.

03:12.526 --> 03:17.531
Cactus plants are blooming.

03:17.551 --> 03:22.757
Sagebrush everywhere.

03:22.777 --> 03:27.782
Granite spires are standing all alone.

03:35.373 --> 03:52.504
It's heaven to be riding down the trail when the desert sun goes down.

03:56.635 --> 03:58.577
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:58.898 --> 04:00.940
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:01.380 --> 04:06.166
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:06.206 --> 04:11.452
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:11.972 --> 04:23.385
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember...

04:23.365 --> 04:27.532
Only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:28.293 --> 04:36.807
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowling and a-growling and a-sit in the air.

04:37.488 --> 04:41.414
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

04:41.434 --> 04:46.302
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:54.432 --> 05:02.653
Thank you.
