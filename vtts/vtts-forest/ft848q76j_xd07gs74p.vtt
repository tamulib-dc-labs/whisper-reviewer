WEBVTT

00:13.413 --> 00:26.825
Well, howdy, friends.

00:26.845 --> 00:31.250
This is the old woods rider, Jelly Elliott and Three Knot Heads.

00:31.270 --> 00:33.852
We'd like to come in and visit with you a while there.

00:33.872 --> 00:41.479
Or better still, we'd like for you to come down the trail and set with us a spell here under the old big pine tree right down there.

00:42.455 --> 00:44.517
by the side of the creek.

00:44.537 --> 00:53.627
We're going to be with you for the next 14 1⁄2 minutes, brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service.

00:53.647 --> 00:54.148
Yes, sir.

00:54.829 --> 00:56.911
And we're going to try to do some picking and singing here.

00:57.492 --> 01:07.543
And we've just got gloms and gloms and oodles and oodles and oodles of nice fan mail, some of the nicest cards and letters that you've ever seen.

01:07.563 --> 01:12.428
We've got them from big, little, old, and young, and we really appreciate them a whole lot.

01:12.779 --> 01:21.812
We want you to know right now, friends, right out of the deepest of our hearts, all of us, the three knotheads and myself, we appreciate this fan mail.

01:21.852 --> 01:22.173
Robert?

01:22.994 --> 01:23.435
Slim?

01:23.995 --> 01:24.356
Deacon?

01:24.797 --> 01:27.120
Yes, sir, we really appreciate it.

01:27.420 --> 01:34.471
And friends, don't tell nobody, but we've had lots and lots of cards and letters here asking us something.

01:34.972 --> 01:36.694
And I'm going to tell you about it in just a minute.

01:37.096 --> 01:38.780
But right now we're going to play a tune.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.181
Yes, sir.

01:39.221 --> 01:42.127
I don't know anything else to do but play a tune or a game of mumble peg.

01:42.147 --> 01:44.512
And I don't feel in the mood for mumble peg.

01:44.632 --> 01:46.296
I feel a song coming on.

01:46.396 --> 01:47.358
I want to sing.

01:47.378 --> 01:48.501
I can feel it just as plain.

01:48.621 --> 01:50.124
I know it just as well as a grown man.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.147
And here it is.

01:51.427 --> 01:53.091
I found her little footprints in the snow.

01:54.414 --> 01:54.514
Music

02:08.112 --> 02:11.756
Well, some folks like the summertime when they can stroll about.

02:12.357 --> 02:15.600
Strolling through the metagreen, it's pleasure, there's no doubt.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.705
Give me the good old wintertime when snow's on the ground.

02:19.845 --> 02:23.590
I found a winter snow on the ground.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.092
I traced a little footprints in the snow.

02:26.353 --> 02:27.394
In snow.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.757
I found a little footprints in the snow.

02:29.777 --> 02:31.098
In snow.

02:31.118 --> 02:34.802
God bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way.

02:34.942 --> 02:35.503
I found a

02:38.774 --> 02:51.608
Yeah, that's you, boy.

02:54.011 --> 02:57.174
When I went to see, hey, there was a big round moon.

02:57.494 --> 03:01.479
Her mother said she'd just stepped out, she'd be retarded, said.

03:01.499 --> 03:04.943
Trained her little footprints, I found them in the snow.

03:05.203 --> 03:08.106
I found them when the snow was on the ground.

03:08.575 --> 03:11.700
I traced her little footpants in the snow.

03:12.021 --> 03:15.487
I found her little footpants in the snow.

03:16.268 --> 03:19.955
God bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way.

03:20.616 --> 03:32.997
I found her when the snow was on the ground.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.957
Now she's up in heaven, she's with that angel band.

03:42.977 --> 03:46.843
Someday I'm gonna meet her in the promised land.

03:46.863 --> 03:50.527
Every time the snow falls, it brings back memories.

03:50.547 --> 03:54.132
Found her when the snow's on the ground.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.996
I'd trace to let her put prints in the snow.

03:57.016 --> 03:57.617
In the snow.

03:57.901 --> 04:00.626
I found her little footprints in the snow.

04:00.647 --> 04:01.709
There she goes.

04:01.729 --> 04:05.456
Got just that happy day when Natalie lost her way.

04:05.616 --> 04:10.045
I found her little footprints in the snow.

04:10.146 --> 04:11.388
All right, there it is, friends.

04:11.448 --> 04:13.572
I found her little footprints in the snow.

04:13.593 --> 04:16.198
And we do hope that you enjoyed it.

04:16.218 --> 04:17.480
Yeah, that's an old timer.

04:17.581 --> 04:19.825
I know that you've heard it time after time.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.830
And maybe a lot of you out there enjoyed it.

04:22.890 --> 04:23.491
We hope so.

04:23.952 --> 04:24.973
Had a lot of requests for it.

04:24.993 --> 04:26.374
Don't forget, friends, you can write to us.

04:26.415 --> 04:30.980
Just send your fan mail to Jelly Elliott and the Three Knot Heads in care of the station that you're now listening.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.063
I'm going to tell you all about this picture in just a minute.

04:33.783 --> 04:34.905
Did I say picture?

04:34.925 --> 04:35.526
Oh, excuse me.

04:36.327 --> 04:39.791
Friends, I wanted to tell you a story about a fellow, two fellows, two of them.

04:39.811 --> 04:43.936
They lived there pretty close to me and the Knot Heads, me and the Three Knot Heads, out there in the country.

04:44.416 --> 04:45.778
Yeah, well...

04:46.163 --> 04:54.614
Back out there, we lived so far back out in the woods of Sunset, between our house and town, and these two fellas lived out there, and one of them cleared the new ground.

04:54.635 --> 04:56.096
We went down there and helped him one day.

04:56.557 --> 04:58.159
Helped him clear his new ground.

04:58.360 --> 05:01.664
And one day, he went down there and the new ground was going to burn it off.

05:02.145 --> 05:08.273
And his neighbor just over the fence there, hollered at him, told him, said, say, neighbor, he said, you're doing the wrong thing there.

05:08.455 --> 05:10.037
You're doing the wrong thing.

05:10.057 --> 05:12.980
And he told him, he said, why don't you mind your own business?

05:13.000 --> 05:19.927
He said, nobody's going to tell me when and how and where to burn my own property.

05:19.947 --> 05:22.749
So the neighbor, he just went to the house and hitched up old Rhodey.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.111
That was his mule.

05:24.151 --> 05:25.732
He had the mule named Rhodey.

05:25.753 --> 05:32.599
He just hooked up old Rhodey and got a turn fly and went down there right quick and plowed him a good wide fire lane around his whole place there.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.322
Because he knew what was fixing to happen.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.125
Sure enough, he went on down there and set that new ground on fire.

05:38.594 --> 05:48.506
Well, this fellow that lived next door to him there, he had two old not-hitted boys, and they got them some wet toe sacks and a couple of buckets of water or two or three, and they got down there and got ready because they were scared of what was going to happen.

05:49.387 --> 05:58.337
And friends, sure enough, he set that new ground on fire, and the wind kind of switched around there a little bit, and first thing you know, he had his barn full of hay and corn and stuff, and it was all good dry stuff.

05:58.618 --> 06:02.582
Spark got in there and burned up his barn, burned it to the ground.

06:02.602 --> 06:07.268
He didn't save not one oat seed, nothing, burned it up.

06:07.653 --> 06:08.954
And liked to burn up his house.

06:08.974 --> 06:11.237
Would have had him been for his neighbor there and them two boys.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.698
They pitched in there and helped him.

06:13.799 --> 06:16.342
Now, that was honoring this one.

06:16.522 --> 06:21.427
I'm telling you, some people just, I guess they get too old to learn or something.

06:21.707 --> 06:23.248
They just have to learn the hard way.

06:23.328 --> 06:24.590
I guess that's all it is.

06:24.610 --> 06:25.691
They just have to learn the hard way.

06:25.991 --> 06:26.832
Here's another tune.

06:26.852 --> 06:28.053
Slim's going to sing this one.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.435
It's a sad song.

06:29.455 --> 06:30.616
It's a pretty song, though.

06:31.096 --> 06:32.778
It's sad, but it's pretty.

06:32.798 --> 06:34.480
I never did like these sad songs.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.002
But anyhow, Slim sings them.

06:37.319 --> 06:44.950
And ain't nothing I can do about it, because if it was, I ought to hit him on his not head, but I guess I can't.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.272
He's bigger than me.

06:46.292 --> 06:52.821
Here's Slim to sing Unfaithful One.

06:57.328 --> 07:04.899
Unfaithful one, your tears are falling.

07:04.919 --> 07:05.760
Yes, darling.

07:05.780 --> 07:07.242
At last you're paying.

07:10.681 --> 07:36.351
For now you find you were mistaken.

07:39.487 --> 07:47.439
Thought your game was almost wild.

07:47.459 --> 07:55.151
The tide has turned and left you weeping.

07:56.513 --> 08:04.044
Go on and cry, unfaithful wild.

08:04.505 --> 08:06.608
Unfaithful wild.

08:08.613 --> 08:29.794
The world has ended It ended like it was begun It started with a careless promise

08:34.229 --> 08:52.727
unfaithful one you're weeping for your castle like broken hearts come

09:00.065 --> 09:16.361
Ain't now rebuilding Go on and cry Unfaithful one Thank you, Slim, thank you.

09:16.381 --> 09:17.122
There it is, friends.

09:17.222 --> 09:18.203
Unfaithful one.

09:18.644 --> 09:19.985
That's a mighty pretty tune.

09:21.046 --> 09:22.087
Just listen to the words there.

09:22.487 --> 09:24.790
And if you like it, just write us a penny-fourth card a letter.

09:24.810 --> 09:26.111
We'd be glad to do it again for you.

09:26.431 --> 09:26.912
No kidding.

09:26.932 --> 09:29.194
We got a lot of cards and letters here saying,

09:29.377 --> 09:31.521
Why don't you and the boys have a picture made?

09:31.962 --> 09:33.384
We'd like to have a picture.

09:33.404 --> 09:34.205
We want a picture.

09:34.746 --> 09:36.750
We got insects in the garden.

09:36.790 --> 09:37.952
We got roaches in the kitchen.

09:37.972 --> 09:39.054
We'd like to have it.

09:40.737 --> 09:41.518
No kidding, friends.

09:41.538 --> 09:43.041
We've had a lot of requests for a picture.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.265
Well, now, here's news for you.

09:45.665 --> 09:46.427
Free news.

09:46.447 --> 09:47.088
It's all free.

09:47.348 --> 09:48.130
Don't cost you a thing.

09:48.951 --> 09:54.000
Your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's forestry service has made it possible

09:54.318 --> 09:59.565
For you to have a picture of the three knotheads and myself, absolutely free.

10:00.286 --> 10:03.932
Now, all you do to get this picture, here's all you do, friends.

10:03.952 --> 10:04.693
Now, listen to this.

10:05.273 --> 10:07.577
Just write us a penny postcard or a letter.

10:08.338 --> 10:09.019
Is that fair enough?

10:09.279 --> 10:24.240
Now, if you want a picture, just sit down right now, write a penny postcard or a letter, and put on there very plainly your name and address, and we'll send you a picture of the three knotheads and myself right here in action, right here on the station.

10:24.490 --> 10:28.154
Just blowing our top and showing our ignorance and having a good time.

10:28.694 --> 10:29.315
And we'd like that.

10:29.615 --> 10:30.796
It's a mighty good picture, too.

10:31.097 --> 10:34.540
You can put it out in the garden, keep the insects off the turnips and all that sort of stuff.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.624
Put it in the kitchen, keep the mice, rats, and rodents.

10:38.644 --> 10:39.745
Where'd I get that at?

10:39.906 --> 10:41.087
Rodents.

10:42.348 --> 10:43.509
Somebody must have told.

10:44.070 --> 10:45.171
Somebody did tell me that.

10:45.371 --> 10:46.472
Anyhow, it's good.

10:47.133 --> 10:48.454
And we'd like for you to have the picture.

10:48.474 --> 10:51.257
Now, if you want the picture, friends, don't forget.

10:51.575 --> 10:56.081
that all you got to do is just sit down and write us a penny postcard or letter, and we'll send you the picture.

10:56.883 --> 10:57.183
Free.

10:57.383 --> 10:57.904
That's all free.

10:58.144 --> 11:02.130
Friends, you know, I just can't get my mind off of this fire proposition.

11:02.170 --> 11:09.901
That leatherhead, he went ahead and set his new ground on fire there, and his neighbor over there was trying to tell him all the time not to do it.

11:09.921 --> 11:15.770
It was hot and dry and windy that day, and Dad blamed his leatherhead at the time.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.532
He should have known better than that.

11:18.288 --> 11:20.010
They'll burn off of new ground.

11:20.050 --> 11:27.921
Anybody knows to make little bitty brush heaps and burn them off late in the evening when it's sort of damp, more or less damp.

11:27.981 --> 11:30.805
Well, you could call it damp, and still it's not damp.

11:30.825 --> 11:31.966
The brush heaps will burn.

11:32.026 --> 11:34.590
They'll burn good, but still there's no wind.

11:34.630 --> 11:47.367
It's very quiet, and you can have two or three buckets of water sitting around there, and you might invite your neighbors over that night and have popcorn popping or candy pulling or something like that sort of help you if the fire gets out.

11:47.549 --> 12:15.953
Because, friends, that timber, that little old timber, them little old bitties, little old timber, them little old bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber, them little bitties, little old timber,

12:16.304 --> 12:17.731
Did you ever stop to think of that?

12:18.053 --> 12:19.057
Well, that's right.

12:19.078 --> 12:23.519
And I know all of you out there has got nice families, and you love your children.

12:23.620 --> 12:24.323
I love mine.

12:25.163 --> 12:27.546
And we got to see that they have some timber.

12:27.566 --> 12:31.632
And the only way that they're going to have timber is you and me to see that they do have it.

12:32.033 --> 12:33.094
So keep that in mind.

12:33.395 --> 12:34.476
Let's play another tune here.

12:34.496 --> 12:36.719
Robert, how about a little bit of a hoedown here, buddy?

12:36.739 --> 12:37.841
We haven't played a hoedown.

12:38.161 --> 12:42.287
You know that's a tune that we haven't played in a long time, and we've had a lot of requests for it.

12:42.307 --> 12:44.250
Here we go, and it's way down yonder.

12:44.530 --> 12:50.158
¶¶

12:52.619 --> 12:57.651
Woo!

13:21.745 --> 13:23.888
Robert, thank you there, buddy.

13:24.329 --> 13:27.112
I'm telling you, that was way down yonder.

13:27.133 --> 13:29.936
Played way down yonder, too, wasn't it there, buddy?

13:29.956 --> 13:34.623
That was all right, too, and I know a lot of them old-timers out there.

13:35.044 --> 13:40.832
You take them old fellas sitting out there with a little dab of that gray hair mixed in up there.

13:40.852 --> 13:41.813
You know, that's an honor.

13:42.181 --> 13:44.564
I'm telling you, that gray hair is really honored.

13:44.584 --> 13:46.186
That's something to be proud of.

13:46.206 --> 13:49.650
Friends, we've enjoyed visiting with you today, and we've run out of time.

13:49.670 --> 13:53.615
We're going to have to shove off here, saddle up our stick horses, and ride on down the trail.

13:54.616 --> 13:57.339
Well, we're going to have to leave the old pine tree today, but we'll be back.

13:57.359 --> 13:59.382
You just listen to the announcer, and he'll tell you what day.

13:59.422 --> 14:05.269
Now, don't forget, if you want a picture of the three knotheads and myself, all you do is write us a penny postcard or letter.

14:05.529 --> 14:08.593
That's Jelly Elliott and the three knotheads in care of the station that you're now listening.

14:09.029 --> 14:16.920
And friends, don't forget for the last 14 and a half minutes we've been brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your State Forestry Service and Uncle Sam's Forestry Service.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.884
Now before we go, I'd like to leave a thought for the day with you.

14:19.904 --> 14:26.933
When it comes to using fire in or near the woods, it's sure better to be safe than sorry.

14:28.616 --> 14:33.282
Remember friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

14:44.568 --> 14:46.697
And to it!
