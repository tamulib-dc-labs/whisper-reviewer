00:00.00 --> 00:08.000
[Silence.]

00:08.452 --> 00:32.192
[Music.]

00:32.870 --> 00:34.192
All right.

00:34.252 --> 00:34.914
Thank you, boys.

00:34.954 --> 00:35.414
Thank you.

00:35.555 --> 00:36.236
Howdy, friends.

00:36.256 --> 00:37.057
How are y'all?

00:37.077 --> 00:37.498
Yes, sir.

00:38.820 --> 00:45.973
It's me again, if you don't mind, the old woods rider himself, Jelly Elliott, and all the Knotheads gathered up here under the old pine tree.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.078
And we are mighty glad you've come our way.

00:49.138 --> 00:53.506
We've got some nice tunes picked out for you today that we hope you're going to enjoy.

00:53.886 --> 00:57.212
We're going to start things off with Bob playing Black Mountain Rag.

00:57.973 --> 02:35.213
[Music.]

02:35.213 --> 02:39.378
Thank you, Bob.

02:39.498 --> 02:40.179
Thank you a lot.

02:40.279 --> 02:49.390
You know, friends, it's really interesting to me, and I know it's interesting to a lot of y'all, at how people are taking a hand in this forestry work.

02:49.410 --> 02:57.039
Now, the forestry boys, the boys that I have dealings with every day and every night, they're very happy about the whole thing.

02:57.059 --> 03:00.883
In fact, everybody's concern is happy, and I'm happy.

03:01.319 --> 03:06.324
They're getting more and more careful every day, and they're getting more and more forestry-wise.

03:06.344 --> 03:08.306
We're really proud of that, ain't you?

03:08.667 --> 03:09.448
Well, I know you are.

03:09.848 --> 03:12.691
We've come a long ways in the last few years, friends.

03:13.372 --> 03:14.093
We really have.

03:14.973 --> 03:16.035
All right, that's fine.

03:16.415 --> 03:18.637
But we've still got a long way to go.

03:19.398 --> 03:21.641
Now, take this story about Tom, Dick, and Harry.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.983
I know most of you heard about Tom, Dick, and Harry.

03:24.243 --> 03:25.565
There was a Tom Smith.

03:25.645 --> 03:26.626
I knew Tom Smith.

03:27.407 --> 03:30.550
Well, Tom went fishing one day, and he was very careful.

03:31.019 --> 03:32.401
He put out every match.

03:32.481 --> 03:35.586
Every time he lit a cigarette, he put out the match, was very careful.

03:35.726 --> 03:42.556
He stomped the cigarette and was real sure it was dug into the ground real good and well put out.

03:42.576 --> 03:44.138
He was awful careful.

03:44.158 --> 03:53.551
Well, on his way home, driving down alongside the highway, he sees a little small fire just starting alongside the highway where somebody had thrown a match or a cigarette.

03:54.032 --> 03:55.574
Well, what did Tom do?

03:55.594 --> 03:56.255
He drove on.

03:56.656 --> 03:57.677
That's what he did, friends.

03:57.717 --> 03:58.258
He really did.

03:59.420 --> 04:00.681
Now there was Dick Brown.

04:01.042 --> 04:01.882
He went camping.

04:01.982 --> 04:03.124
He went out camp fishing.

04:04.104 --> 04:08.689
Now Dick done a wonderful job of keeping his campfire safe.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.493
He cleaned back all the leaves and sticks and everything, and he was very careful.

04:13.073 --> 04:17.738
When he got ready to break camp and leave, he made sure that it was dead out.

04:17.758 --> 04:22.822
In fact, he carried several buckets of water up the hill to be sure that this fire was dead out.

04:23.803 --> 04:27.587
But on his way out of the woods and all, he passed another campground.

04:27.905 --> 04:29.527
where other people had been camping.

04:30.488 --> 04:33.071
And he saw a deserted little campfire.

04:33.171 --> 04:34.212
It was still smoking.

04:35.393 --> 04:36.895
Well, what did he do?

04:36.915 --> 04:40.659
Well, he drove right on, went on home.

04:40.679 --> 04:41.980
Well, there was Harry Green.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.342
Harry was a farmer.

04:43.402 --> 04:47.946
Harry had a nice little farm, and he was a good farmer and a good citizen, a fine fellow.

04:47.966 --> 04:54.213
And he had a field that he was planning to burn the trash off, a new ground, in other words, friends.

04:54.233 --> 04:55.575
To most of you, it's a new ground.

04:55.595 --> 04:56.916
To me, it's just a plain new ground.

04:57.385 --> 05:08.479
Well, Harry had cleaned up this new ground, and he was getting ready to burn it off and plow it up and start planting it in a crop, you see, and had it ready.

05:09.521 --> 05:11.163
New place to farm, in other words.

05:12.505 --> 05:16.790
So he went out and he plowed a good fire line all the way around the whole field.

05:17.852 --> 05:21.557
And he had all the piles made up nice there in little small piles.

05:22.338 --> 05:25.722
And he was going to burn, and he decided to burn on Saturday afternoons.

05:26.461 --> 05:35.530
But he didn't tell the local forestry boys, the local fire warden, or any of the forestry boys, he didn't tell them he was going to burn.

05:35.550 --> 05:36.251
And what happened?

05:37.352 --> 05:39.774
Well, friends, that makes a mighty interesting story.

05:39.954 --> 05:42.837
But right now, I guess we're going to play a tune.

05:42.857 --> 05:45.960
And we're going to feature Charlie on this next tune, Charlie Stuckey.

05:45.980 --> 05:48.843
Boy plays the bass fiddle, and he sings it very nicely, too.

05:49.363 --> 05:56.350
And he's going to sing a song called Give a Little and Take a Little.

05:57.342 --> 06:01.448
Give a little take, a little take, a little kiss from me.

06:02.729 --> 06:07.236
Take a little give, a little give, a little kiss to me.

06:07.957 --> 06:11.782
You're the one, the only one, the girl I'm thinking of.

06:13.244 --> 06:16.348
Don't you be afraid, let's make a little trade.

06:16.428 --> 06:19.873
Let's give a little take, a little love.

06:19.853 --> 06:48.173
Give a little, take a little, won't you give your heart to me Take a little, give a little, I will give you mine, you see Don't be shy, you know that I am true as the stars above Just come into my arms, let's share each other's charms Let's give a little, take a little, love guitar solo

06:51.376 --> 07:14.027
Give a little take, a little take, a little kiss from me.

07:14.107 --> 07:18.092
Take a little give, a little give, a little kiss to me.

07:19.372 --> 07:36.116
You're the one, the only one, the girl I'm thinking of Don't you be afraid, let's make a little trade Let's give a little, take a little, love Give a little, take a little, won't you give your heart to me?

07:37.377 --> 07:47.151
Take a little, give a little, I will give you mine, you see Don't be shy, you know that I am true as the stars above

07:47.587 --> 07:49.330
Just come into my arms.

07:49.370 --> 07:51.072
Let's share each other's charm.

07:51.092 --> 07:55.559
Let's give a little, take a little love.

07:55.639 --> 08:00.065
Thank you, Charlie.

08:00.126 --> 08:00.526
Thank you.

08:00.546 --> 08:01.187
There it is.

08:01.207 --> 08:03.451
Give a little and take a little.

08:04.172 --> 08:06.475
That's a pretty good thing to remember, ain't it?

08:06.575 --> 08:08.137
That's the way we got to go through life.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.281
Giving a little and taking a little.

08:10.301 --> 08:13.746
Friends, I was talking about this farmer, Harry Green, you know.

08:13.766 --> 08:14.607
Well, Harry Green...

08:15.312 --> 08:22.343
He was the boy that took all the care in the world, but he didn't notify that he was going to burn on Saturday.

08:22.363 --> 08:31.416
Well, sir, I was right up in the fire tower that day with the dispatcher when he spotted two smokes, a little smoke and a big one.

08:31.436 --> 08:34.881
They were in different directions from the tower and miles apart.

08:35.002 --> 08:36.884
It was a long ways apart.

08:36.904 --> 08:39.328
Well, sir, there was only one fire crew available.

08:39.815 --> 08:44.762
and the dispatcher took the only action any sensible human being could have taken.

08:44.982 --> 08:45.343
Listen.

08:46.144 --> 08:48.367
Longville Tower to fire crew number three.

08:48.387 --> 08:49.829
Ralph, I got a couple of smokes.

08:50.029 --> 08:50.970
One's pretty big.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.072
We'd better hit it.

08:52.092 --> 08:54.215
Section 8, Township 3, Range 2.

08:54.595 --> 08:55.817
They're logging in that area.

08:55.837 --> 08:56.338
Get going.

08:57.539 --> 08:58.581
Okay, Longville.

08:58.701 --> 09:00.824
Section 8, Township 3, Range 2.

09:01.465 --> 09:02.166
We're on our way.

09:02.186 --> 09:02.987
Unit 4 out.

09:04.269 --> 09:07.974
Now, that crew had a long way to go, about 20 miles.

09:07.994 --> 09:09.636
And finally, they called in.

09:10.713 --> 09:12.295
Unit 4 to Longville Tower.

09:13.176 --> 09:14.759
Joe, this is Ralph.

09:14.779 --> 09:15.960
Do you know where we are?

09:16.421 --> 09:19.385
Right in the middle of Harry Green's form.

09:19.405 --> 09:21.869
He's clearing and burning a new field.

09:21.889 --> 09:25.354
Best job of keeping the fire safe I've seen.

09:25.374 --> 09:30.181
Green's mighty sorry you forgot to call us and let us know he was going to burn today, so here we are.

09:32.143 --> 09:36.590
Now that was a 20-mile run to a false alarm fire.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.494
Burning up gas paid for by the taxpayers.

09:39.574 --> 09:40.315
That's you and me.

09:41.425 --> 09:43.808
Pying up men and equipment.

09:43.828 --> 09:45.409
What do you want us to do now, Joe?

09:46.290 --> 09:48.453
Hang around here or start on back there?

09:48.473 --> 09:49.434
Calling Longville.

09:49.554 --> 09:50.815
Rock Creek to Longville.

09:51.496 --> 09:55.420
Joe, that little smoke's filling up mighty fast, mighty fast.

09:56.021 --> 09:57.883
I think the fire's really cut loose.

09:58.703 --> 09:59.865
Better send someone on it.

10:00.525 --> 10:02.528
Rock Creek out.

10:02.548 --> 10:03.909
Did you get that, Ralph?

10:03.929 --> 10:05.751
That little smoke is a big one now.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.414
It's in section 10, Township 9, range 2.

10:08.754 --> 10:09.475
On your way, boy.

10:11.092 --> 10:12.374
Golly, Joe.

10:12.875 --> 10:15.519
That's 40 miles from Green's place.

10:15.539 --> 10:16.501
But we're heading out.

10:16.581 --> 10:19.205
Call you later.

10:19.225 --> 10:25.816
Well, friends, when the crew got to the real fire, they had a roaring devil on their hands.

10:26.537 --> 10:28.160
Well, they put it out finally.

10:28.941 --> 10:32.467
But a lot of fine timber was lost and burned.

10:32.547 --> 10:34.450
The soil was damaged.

10:34.470 --> 10:37.335
A lot of dollars went up in smoke and ashes.

10:38.699 --> 10:42.505
And that's what I mean when I say we all gotta help.

10:42.525 --> 10:44.328
Then help some more.

10:44.348 --> 10:44.909
All the way.

10:45.550 --> 10:46.251
All the time.

10:46.912 --> 10:47.954
Here's the next tune.

10:47.974 --> 10:50.297
Features Herman on a steel guitar.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.321
In fact, Herman's stealing.

10:52.341 --> 10:58.210
He's stealing the blues.

11:04.619 --> 11:19.287
so

11:27.991 --> 11:46.793
guitar solo

11:58.062 --> 12:16.618
Thank you boys, thank you.

12:16.799 --> 12:18.602
Friends, that is actually what happened.

12:18.886 --> 12:22.992
You just made a trip with me up into one of the fire towers.

12:23.012 --> 12:24.634
Now you know what goes on up there.

12:25.055 --> 12:26.918
That is what actually happened.

12:26.938 --> 12:31.043
Friends, we've run out of time, and we're going to have to go as bad as we hate to.

12:31.063 --> 12:35.570
We're just going to have to leave you here under the old pine tree, but we'll be back.

12:35.590 --> 12:41.839
Before we go, though, here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you, and I do hope you'll keep it in mind.

12:42.981 --> 12:46.125
However careful with fire we may be,

12:46.747 --> 12:49.694
There will always be those who are not.

12:49.714 --> 12:52.060
So sometimes we have double duty to do.

12:52.742 --> 12:53.323
Let's do it.

12:54.085 --> 13:04.350
And thanks a lot.

13:07.975 --> 13:13.663
Well, friends, we've enjoyed the visit here under the old pine tree with you, and we'll be back your way soon.

13:13.703 --> 13:19.390
If you'll listen to the local announcer, he'll let you know the exact date and time.

13:19.410 --> 13:32.127
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:34.537 --> 13:39.925
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

13:39.945 --> 14:16.908
[Music.]
