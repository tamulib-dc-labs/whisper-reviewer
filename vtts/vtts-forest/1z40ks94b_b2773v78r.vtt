00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
[Silence.]

00:20.703 --> 00:32.316
He can't find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:32.677 --> 00:34.359
That's why they called him Smokey.

00:34.379 --> 00:36.061
That was how he got his name.

00:36.481 --> 00:37.522
Hi there, friends.

00:37.542 --> 00:39.585
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:40.045 --> 00:42.608
I'm glad you could come up this way up the trail again today.

00:42.909 --> 00:45.211
So how about having a seat beside me?

00:45.231 --> 00:48.575
Right here on the log under the old pine tree.

00:48.595 --> 00:50.237
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:51.112 --> 00:54.056
You know, that's because we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:54.838 --> 00:59.745
We thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:59.765 --> 01:05.614
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there, the Sons of the Pioneers.

01:05.634 --> 01:07.797
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail, too.

01:07.897 --> 01:14.007
And now that you're here and comfortably settled, they're going to start off this little outdoor get-together of ours.

01:14.127 --> 01:17.592
So just relax and let's hear some mighty fine singing, huh?

01:21.723 --> 01:28.518
Pecos Bill was quite a cowboy down in Texas, and a western superman to say to least.

01:29.300 --> 01:36.677
He was the roughest, toughest critter, never known to be a quitter, cause he never had no fear of man or beast.

01:36.978 --> 01:44.469
So Yippee-I-A-I-A, Yippee-I-O, heard it up the critter west of the Alamo.

01:45.330 --> 01:52.401
Pecos roped a raging cyclone out of nowhere, and he straddled it and settled down with ease.

01:52.902 --> 02:00.172
And as that cyclone bucked and flitted, Pecos rolled a smoke and lit it, and he tamed that ordinary wind down to a breeze.

02:00.713 --> 02:04.639
So Yippee-I-A-I-A, Yippee-I-O,

02:04.619 --> 02:08.965
For the toughest critter west of the Alamo.

02:08.985 --> 02:12.870
Once a plant of rustle stole the herd of cattle.

02:12.890 --> 02:16.575
But they didn't know the herd they stole was built.

02:16.595 --> 02:20.740
So when he caught them crooked villains, Pecos knocked out all their feelings.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.884
And that's the reason that there's gold in them there here.

02:24.625 --> 02:26.508
Yippee-i-ay.

02:26.648 --> 02:29.271
Yippee-i-oh.

02:29.351 --> 02:32.095
For the toughest critter west of the Alamo.

02:34.032 --> 02:41.262
Pecos lost his way while traveling on the desert.

02:41.422 --> 02:42.163
Water.

02:43.746 --> 02:50.074
It was 90 miles across the burning sand.

02:50.154 --> 02:52.317
Water.

02:52.338 --> 02:59.888
He knew he'd never reach the border if he didn't get some water.

03:01.319 --> 03:05.365
So he got a stickin' duck the real grand.

03:20.647 --> 03:27.917
While a tribe of painted Indian did a war dance, Pecos started shootin' up their little gang.

03:28.184 --> 03:35.089
He gave them redskins such a shake-up that they jumped out from their makeup, and that's the way the painted desert got its name.

03:36.267 --> 04:03.169
Yippee-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi

04:03.723 --> 04:11.594
As the emblem of the Lone Star, Texas.

04:12.295 --> 04:15.079
Pecos Bill sure had it rough already.

04:15.099 --> 04:22.229
But his problems were nothing at all compared to the folks who have had to live through and live down a bad range fire.

04:23.231 --> 04:30.321
When fire runs wild through the dry grass and pastures or across the open range, you've really got a terrible mess on your hands.

04:30.976 --> 04:36.241
There are a number of reasons, of course, why grass and brush and range fires are such bad business.

04:37.142 --> 04:43.528
Those fires destroy the food that the livestock, and in some cases the wildlife, need for life itself.

04:44.629 --> 04:53.237
And when you cut down on the supply of food for a man's livestock, you can imagine what that does to the livelihood of the farmer or rancher.

04:53.257 --> 05:00.223
And range fires have a nasty way of just sweeping everything in their path, valuable equipment as well as buildings.

05:00.575 --> 05:02.397
Sometimes the animals themselves.

05:03.638 --> 05:08.203
We all have a part to play in cutting down on grass and range fires.

05:08.223 --> 05:18.333
The land may not be ours, sure, but the meat and dairy products and leather that land produces come to our table and homes eventually.

05:18.353 --> 05:26.582
And I'm thinking that when we help to prevent these fires, whether they're forest fires or range fires, we're not only helping yourselves.

05:27.507 --> 05:33.035
We're keeping America green and producing for our children and those who will follow them as well.

05:34.297 --> 05:39.825
What youngster doesn't like to saddle up his pony and ride the beautiful ring?

05:39.845 --> 05:42.168
That's what makes him so tired at night.

05:42.188 --> 05:51.642
Close your sleepy eyes, my little buckaroo.

05:51.892 --> 06:09.276
While the light from western skies is shining down on you Don't you know it's time for bed Another day is through

06:09.610 --> 06:31.382
So go to sleep, my little buckaroo Don't you realize, my little buckaroo It was from a tiny acorn

06:31.801 --> 07:00.222
That the oak tree grew And remember Buffalo Bell Was once a kid like you So go to sleep My little buckaroo Mmm

07:00.640 --> 07:06.727
Soon you're gonna ride the range like grown-up cowboys do.

07:09.070 --> 07:17.180
Don't you think it's time you were rounding up a dream or two?

07:17.720 --> 07:25.129
So go to sleep, my little buckaroo.

07:30.205 --> 07:49.207
And you know, friends, talking about range fires, they're mighty serious for another reason, and that's water.

07:50.368 --> 07:58.457
When fire strips the grass and brush off the land, that upsets the water storage and supply balance, just like a forest fire does.

07:59.095 --> 08:04.963
You get erosion and, during heavy rainstorms, pretty bad floods sometimes.

08:04.983 --> 08:08.248
There's no doubt about it, friends, the choice is always our own.

08:08.949 --> 08:13.976
Whether the land produces good, clear water or poor, muddy water.

08:13.996 --> 08:20.426
And the difference very often is whether we keep fire from running wild across the land or not.

08:20.446 --> 08:26.214
Lloyd Pearman was telling me a while back about some of the experiences he had and the rest of the boys, too.

08:26.955 --> 08:29.018
Suppose you tell our friends all about it, Lloyd.

08:29.302 --> 08:32.527
We've known good days on the range and bad ones, Billy.

08:33.228 --> 08:37.635
The bad ones come when there's been no rain for as long as a man can remember.

08:37.735 --> 08:45.888
And as if that wasn't bad enough, some fella goes careless on us and tosses a live match into the dry grass or brush.

08:46.609 --> 08:50.415
Or he goes off and leaves a little fire burning and what happens?

08:51.256 --> 09:03.271
You end up with a big old fire running wild, eating up that dry grass, often burning up stacks of hay in ranch buildings, and even cattle sometimes when they run crazy in the smoke.

09:03.291 --> 09:05.614
We've lost our jobs after a big range fire.

09:06.394 --> 09:08.898
Sure makes a fellow sad as well as mad.

09:09.478 --> 09:14.344
And you get sick at heart wondering how folks can be so doggone careless.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.266
I know what you mean, Lloyd.

09:17.007 --> 09:19.170
Carelessness with fire costs plenty.

09:20.045 --> 09:25.431
And the person who is careless, he pays his share, too, in one way or another.

09:25.451 --> 09:43.892
But now, how about you and the other Sons of the Pioneers taking us along with you as you head back to the lone trade?

09:43.912 --> 09:48.718
Oh, carry me back

09:50.926 --> 10:14.689
And when I die, you can bury me.

10:15.833 --> 10:35.462
Beneath the western sky On the long prairie I'm a roving cowboy

10:35.847 --> 10:52.388
Far away from home, far from the prairie that I used to roam.

10:52.368 --> 11:04.073
Where the doggies wander and the wind blow stream.

11:04.093 --> 11:13.212
Oh, my heart is yonder on the lone prairie.

11:15.335 --> 11:31.673
oh carry me back to the lone prairie where the coyotes are

11:31.653 --> 11:58.892
Let the wind blow sweet And when I die You can bury me Beneath the western sky On the lone prairie

12:02.011 --> 12:14.811
On the long prairie.

12:14.831 --> 12:15.231
Yes, sir.

12:16.814 --> 12:19.698
And now just look, will you, who's coming up the trail.

12:19.718 --> 12:26.208
It's Smokey Bear who's got just as much interest in stopping range fires as he has in preventing forest fires.

12:27.490 --> 12:29.453
Hello there, folks.

12:30.462 --> 12:36.110
Do you know what causes more pasture and range fires than any other single thing?

12:36.991 --> 12:43.800
It's the careless flipping of a match or cigarette into dry grass, leaves, or brush.

12:44.801 --> 12:50.108
You just can't be too careful with fire in range country.

12:50.128 --> 13:00.402
Please keep in mind the simple rules of safety about breaking your match in two, taking full care with every campfire, brush,

13:00.652 --> 13:02.715
or clearing fire.

13:02.735 --> 13:07.822
Above all, don't be a careless match or cigarette flipper.

13:09.084 --> 13:11.767
Well, I'll be seen.

13:11.807 --> 13:14.491
And there he goes down the trail.

13:15.132 --> 13:17.295
Thank you, Smokey.

13:17.315 --> 13:20.880
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:21.741 --> 13:24.585
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:25.466 --> 13:29.832
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service,

13:30.115 --> 13:35.221
and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:35.241 --> 13:39.445
Until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:40.106 --> 13:45.852
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent grass, brush, and range fire.

13:47.194 --> 13:55.803
Well, so long for now from Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those wonderful fellas who sing your favorite songs of the outdoors the way you like to hear them.

13:56.143 --> 13:57.625
The Sons of the Pioneers.

13:58.212 --> 14:02.100
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.509
Howlin' and a-browlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:06.990 --> 14:10.919
He can find a fire before he starts to flame.

14:11.299 --> 14:15.428
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:15.813 --> 14:24.008
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, growlin' and a-growlin' and a-snippin' the air.

14:24.569 --> 14:32.764
He can find a fire before it starts to flame, that's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his aim.

14:33.345 --> 14:37.332
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:37.632 --> 14:41.495
Crowlin' and a-growlin' and a-snippin' the air.

14:42.176 --> 14:45.839
He can find a fire before it starts to fling.

14:46.220 --> 14:50.243
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:50.784 --> 14:54.667
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.991
Crowlin' and a-growlin' and a-snippin' the air.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.415
He can find a fire before it starts to fling.

15:03.796 --> 15:07.639
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

15:07.639 --> 15:45.056
[Music.]

15:45.056 --> 16:04.000
[Silence.]
