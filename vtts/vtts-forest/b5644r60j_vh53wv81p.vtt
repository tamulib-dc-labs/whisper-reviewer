00:00.000 --> 00:30.000
[Music.]

00:30.000 --> 00:32.460
All right, boys, thank you a lot, thank you a lot.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.243
Yes, a friend, you guessed it, that's right.

00:34.824 --> 00:38.269
Time once again for your old woods rider, Jelly Elliot and the Three Knotheads.

00:38.930 --> 00:41.093
Friends are sitting here under the big old pine tree.

00:41.153 --> 00:43.977
The pine needed to have fallen, and we're just having a big time.

00:44.395 --> 00:47.560
We're just hoping that you'd pull up a chair and relax there for just a little while.

00:48.381 --> 00:51.987
Because the boys and myself have got a few things here which we just got to tell you.

00:52.007 --> 00:52.948
That's all there is to it.

00:52.988 --> 00:53.749
So stick around.

00:54.270 --> 00:54.711
Relax.

00:55.772 --> 00:57.375
We'll start off here with a good tune.

00:57.415 --> 00:58.176
Features Jack.

00:58.196 --> 01:01.381
It's an old timey hoedown, breakdown, they used to call them.

01:01.421 --> 01:03.504
Then they got fancy and started calling them hoedowns.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.846
But they're still breakdowns.

01:04.886 --> 01:06.789
And Jack really fiddles a breakdown.

01:06.829 --> 01:09.794
And here he is with one of his outstanding breakdowns.

01:09.854 --> 01:10.896
Fast Train Blues.

01:10.996 --> 01:12.478
Yeah.

01:21.149 --> 01:31.681
I'm thirsty, Jack.

01:31.902 --> 01:34.164
Whee!

01:34.184 --> 01:49.823
[Music.]

01:49.803 --> 01:52.129
Oh, son, you got the first line.

01:52.189 --> 01:54.755
Oh, go that one, sir, boy.

01:54.795 --> 01:58.384
Go that one, though.

01:58.505 --> 02:06.765
That boy sure pulled a lost his boat.

02:07.285 --> 02:26.504
Oh, he's going to Holland there, son.

02:26.584 --> 02:35.453
Hot.

02:35.433 --> 02:52.374
Well, all right there, Jack.

02:52.394 --> 02:53.195
Thank you there, buddy.

02:53.555 --> 02:56.078
Son, that really makes a goose bump raise up on me.

02:56.719 --> 02:57.640
I'm telling you the truth.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.582
That's mighty fine fitting.

02:59.602 --> 03:04.208
Friends, this is the last program in this series, and I want to

03:04.424 --> 03:09.892
the boys to all come up and say goodbye to you, so I'll... in their own fashion, of course.

03:10.713 --> 03:12.475
And I'll start off with Herman.

03:12.515 --> 03:18.003
Herman Poppolis plays his steel guitar over there, and Herman plays a lot of steel.

03:18.023 --> 03:21.147
So I'm going to ask Herman to say goodbye to you in his own way.

03:21.207 --> 03:21.508
Herman?

03:25.974 --> 03:26.955
Thank you, Herman, thank you.

03:26.975 --> 03:27.756
There he is, friend.

03:27.796 --> 03:28.557
He's pulling off.

03:29.258 --> 03:30.039
Thank you a lot, Herman.

03:30.119 --> 03:32.743
Then we'll get over here to Jack, our ho-down fiddle player...

03:32.960 --> 03:36.364
Of course, Jack plays a lot of fiddle, sings songs and all that sort of stuff.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.507
And we think Jack is an outstanding fiddle player.

03:38.547 --> 03:39.328
Jack Youngblood.

03:39.348 --> 03:46.097
Jack, say goodbye to him, son.

03:46.117 --> 03:47.398
Well, thank you, Jack, thank you.

03:47.418 --> 03:48.500
There it is.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.462
That's mighty fine, buddy.

03:51.063 --> 03:55.849
And then, of course, friends, due to circumstances beyond my control, here's the poet, Lewis.

03:55.869 --> 03:59.193
Lewis, as usual, he's got a poem, so he's wanting to read it.

03:59.254 --> 04:00.435
So here's Lewis Millett.

04:00.854 --> 04:05.220
Harding is such sweet song, so be careful with fire in the woods and forest.

04:05.761 --> 04:09.286
Don't get your feet wet and hope that all the kids will be good in school and all the... Wait a minute.

04:09.306 --> 04:10.207
That's enough, brother.

04:10.228 --> 04:10.748
That's enough.

04:10.808 --> 04:11.529
Thank you, Lewis.

04:11.589 --> 04:11.950
Thank you.

04:11.970 --> 04:14.734
That was a mighty fine for him.

04:15.655 --> 04:21.664
But speaking of that business about being careful with the fire in the woods and all that sort of stuff, he's got something there, friends.

04:22.673 --> 04:23.995
And that's what I've been telling you.

04:24.296 --> 04:27.922
Every time we come to you down the air lanes there, I tell you to be careful.

04:27.962 --> 04:37.137
I beg you to be careful with your fire in the woods and your cigarettes and mashes and the woods fires burning off your new grounds and brush heaps and all that sort of stuff.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.599
You know all these things, friends.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.082
I've told them over and over to you.

04:40.102 --> 04:41.063
Of course, you already knew it.

04:41.103 --> 04:42.586
I was just reminding you.

04:42.606 --> 04:43.107
That's all.

04:44.329 --> 04:45.070
And I...

04:45.505 --> 04:54.958
I really hope that you people out there have enjoyed our programs as much as we've enjoyed bringing them to you because we have a swell time.

04:54.978 --> 04:59.825
The boys and myself, we live just the kind of life that you hear on these programs.

04:59.985 --> 05:01.367
We do.

05:02.088 --> 05:04.131
We try to get all out of life we can.

05:04.671 --> 05:05.452
We like the woods.

05:05.793 --> 05:10.519
And I don't believe there's a human being living that don't like to go out in the woods.

05:10.860 --> 05:11.861
I just don't believe there is.

05:12.822 --> 05:14.685
That's a funny thing.

05:14.902 --> 05:20.310
But everybody's got a certain amount of that instinct of some kind.

05:20.410 --> 05:20.791
I don't know.

05:20.871 --> 05:22.794
I guess you'd call it animal instinct or something.

05:22.814 --> 05:24.997
They just love to get out in the woods.

05:25.017 --> 05:26.259
And we've got nice woods.

05:26.299 --> 05:31.707
We've always had nice woods throughout this good old United States in some sections.

05:32.268 --> 05:33.510
And we want to take care of them.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.672
We want them bigger and better.

05:35.433 --> 05:37.897
And God put them here for us to enjoy and use.

05:38.658 --> 05:39.700
And we've got to be careful with them.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.721
We've got to take care of them.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.023
We've got to stop all this food stuff.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.142
You're driving down the highway.

05:44.562 --> 05:46.044
Put your cigarettes in the ashtray.

05:46.424 --> 05:48.086
Put your matches in the ashtray.

05:48.147 --> 05:52.352
Out in the woods, be sure your matches and cigarettes are dead out before you leave them.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.916
Be careful with your fires and all that sort of stuff.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.379
Well, I've been telling you that every day.

05:58.419 --> 06:00.582
Friends, remember that.

06:00.602 --> 06:01.443
Here's the next tune.

06:01.483 --> 06:03.586
I'm going to get the little girls to help me sing this one.

06:03.626 --> 06:07.851
They're here with me today under the old pine tree for the last program in this series.

06:08.412 --> 06:09.613
Surely June is...

06:10.353 --> 06:13.056
and baby Joe is 10.

06:13.737 --> 06:18.522
And we'd gather around the camp that night and sing songs.

06:18.542 --> 06:24.108
We're gonna try to sing one for you today, friends, on this last program, just like we would do it around the camp there.

06:24.128 --> 06:28.853
Now, I'm gonna get the guitar and get over here where they are, where I can sit down, and I'll be right with you in just a minute.

06:29.033 --> 06:29.734
Well, now, let's see.

06:29.774 --> 06:32.456
If you girls are about ready there, we'll start.

06:32.536 --> 06:33.998
I think it'd be mighty nice.

06:34.619 --> 06:37.983
to sing a pretty old hymn here for this last program in this series.

06:38.003 --> 06:38.764
Y'all want to do that?

06:39.345 --> 06:39.485
Yes.

06:39.505 --> 06:40.447
Okay, I'll tell you what we'll do.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.929
We'll sing I'll Fly Away.

06:41.949 --> 06:42.289
You ready?

06:42.329 --> 06:42.750
Here we go.

06:44.151 --> 06:59.091
Some glad morning when this life is o'er I'll fly away To a home on God's celestial shore

07:03.273 --> 07:12.872
I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.

07:12.892 --> 07:21.549
When I die, hallelujah, by and back, I'll fly away.

07:22.451 --> 07:25.737
When the shadows of the slapping

07:31.775 --> 07:40.464
Like a bird from prison boys this long, I'll fly away.

07:43.427 --> 07:50.634
I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.

07:50.654 --> 07:59.503
When I die hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away.

07:59.888 --> 08:25.508
Just a few more weary days and then I'll fly away To a land where joy shall never end I'll fly away I'll fly away, oh glory I'll fly away

08:27.682 --> 08:38.475
When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away.

08:38.495 --> 08:40.738
Well, well, well, now ain't that nice.

08:40.778 --> 08:42.059
Thank you a lot there, girls.

08:42.119 --> 08:43.141
That was mighty pretty.

08:44.302 --> 08:47.947
Yes, sir, I hope everybody out there enjoyed it as much as we did.

08:48.387 --> 08:50.890
Doing it for you, friends, little girls and myself.

08:51.411 --> 08:52.452
They're a little bitty tot.

08:53.874 --> 08:54.955
Friends, you know...

08:55.643 --> 08:58.627
As I told you, this is the last program in this series.

08:59.588 --> 09:11.403
You know, I just want to right now officially declare war on public enemy number one with us, and that is fire.

09:11.423 --> 09:15.027
Now, we want all of you to join in and help us, friends, and I know you will.

09:15.908 --> 09:17.270
We want to keep these fires out.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.653
I want you to tell folks about it.

09:20.133 --> 09:21.175
You can do your part.

09:21.896 --> 09:22.596
I'll do mine.

09:22.777 --> 09:23.738
We'll all pitch in.

09:23.778 --> 09:24.739
We'll all do our part.

09:25.141 --> 09:29.667
It's just little simple things to do, and you know it as well as I do.

09:29.687 --> 09:30.749
So what do you say we do then?

09:31.850 --> 09:51.477
Now, you know, friends, if you friends out there like these little get-togethers that we have with you, if you like them and you want us to continue coming to you through the radios and all that sort of stuff, if you'll give us a little cooperation and be careful with your cigars, cigarettes, and all that sort of stuff.

09:51.517 --> 09:54.000
In other words, help us to cut out these fires.

09:54.638 --> 09:58.041
These unnecessary fires, it costs the government so much.

09:58.061 --> 10:01.305
In the state, everybody loses when we have a wildfire.

10:01.485 --> 10:03.787
Everybody, you and me, our children.

10:04.568 --> 10:05.489
You can't win.

10:05.509 --> 10:06.530
There's not a chance to win.

10:06.630 --> 10:15.699
So if you'll cooperate with us and the average will show it up there in the books and things where we're doing some good, well, then we'll be coming to you more often.

10:16.119 --> 10:17.941
And that'll tickle the boys and myself to death.

10:18.442 --> 10:21.945
And it'll be money in my pocket, your pocket, everybody's pockets.

10:22.583 --> 10:23.204
Don't you see?

10:23.304 --> 10:25.548
I mean, it's really something worth thinking about.

10:26.309 --> 10:30.936
And our nation is getting more and more wise to that fact every day.

10:30.956 --> 10:32.659
But we still have some few left.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.922
Just got to wake up to the fact.

10:34.942 --> 10:36.605
Now, they just haven't stopped to realize.

10:36.825 --> 10:42.695
And if by chance I could get in contact with these particular people and get them switched over, wouldn't that be nice?

10:42.715 --> 10:43.296
It sure would.

10:43.316 --> 10:44.197
Think about it, friends.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.060
Here's the next tune featuring Jack.

10:46.411 --> 10:48.113
Jack, our fiddle player.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.636
Jack, you want to do a good job on this last one on these series, boy.

10:51.016 --> 10:52.138
How about, I'll tell you what we'll do.

10:52.158 --> 10:52.758
I'll tell you what we'll do.

10:52.778 --> 10:56.583
Let's play that old, forever favorite fiddle tune, Down Yonder.

10:56.603 --> 10:59.046
Here we go, son.

10:59.126 --> 11:20.744
[Music.]

11:20.744 --> 11:28.146
Officer Santiago.

11:28.386 --> 11:34.035
Alistair.

11:41.322 --> 11:54.893
Thank you.

12:01.808 --> 12:17.433
That's what I call some fine fiddling there, Jackson, old boy.

12:17.854 --> 12:18.475
Thank you a lot.

12:19.076 --> 12:24.384
Well, friends, we're about to run out of time here under the old pine tree we're going to have to shove off down the trail.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.808
Here's my little thought I want to leave with you.

12:27.689 --> 12:29.352
We've certainly enjoyed being with you.

12:30.428 --> 12:35.656
And if we've done any real good, it'll sure show up in the records, my friend.

12:37.378 --> 12:40.843
With less foul in forest and woods.

12:40.863 --> 12:54.303
Well, there it is, friend.

12:54.844 --> 12:55.825
All over and done with.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.309
The last program in this series.

12:59.707 --> 13:03.271
Sure do hope that we can come your way again some of these days.

13:03.291 --> 13:03.952
Maybe we will.

13:04.032 --> 13:04.793
You can't ever tell.

13:06.295 --> 13:18.490
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:20.512 --> 13:25.539
Remember, friend, only you can prevent forest and woods fire.

13:25.799 --> 14:14.123
[Music.]
