00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
[Silence.]

00:17.000 --> 00:31.452 
[Music.]

00:31.452 --> 00:37.058
The Texas Forest Service of A&M College brings you a story about a fabulous treasure in the ground.

00:37.598 --> 00:41.382
A story drawn from the pages of history and the folklore of Texas.

00:41.782 --> 00:47.088
A story about... The Lost San Saba Mine.

00:53.374 --> 01:01.442
Hundreds of years ago, to be exact in the year 1756, Don Bernardo de Miranda was Lieutenant General of the province of Texas.

01:02.013 --> 01:06.359
The Spanish government had heard strange tales about the wealth of the new world.

01:06.379 --> 01:11.005
Travelers had brought back stories of rivers of silver, of golden nuggets.

01:11.025 --> 01:14.750
The Spanish government decided to explore these wonderful riches.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.674
Miranda was ordered to set out with an expedition.

01:17.694 --> 01:24.122
He left the city of San Fernando, now known as San Antonio, and journeyed for eight days toward the northwest.

01:24.878 --> 01:28.563
There he came upon the Cerro de la Magre, Almagre Hill.

01:29.224 --> 01:34.672
After examining the hill and the cave which he found, Miranda sent back the following report.

01:36.414 --> 01:44.946
The mines which were in the Cerro de la Magre are so numerous that I guarantee to give to every settler of the province of Texas a full claim.

01:45.652 --> 01:52.419
The principal vein is more than two dollars in width, and in its westward lead appears to be of immeasurable thickness.

01:53.059 --> 01:56.142
There are all the natural requirements for a settlement of workers.

01:56.843 --> 02:03.970
Pasturage for livestock, plenty of wood for mine timbers, water for mining operations, and irrigable soil.

02:04.510 --> 02:09.315
Miranda eventually returned to San Fernando with three pounds of ore to be assayed.

02:09.916 --> 02:13.539
Sure enough, the ore showed a good percentage of silver.

02:13.559 --> 02:15.321
Miranda wanted to return to the mines.

02:15.706 --> 02:20.312
but some doubt was raised if the ore sample were representative of the mine.

02:20.332 --> 02:30.164
It was suggested that 30 mule loads of ore be carried from the mines for assaying with the citizens who had staked out claims to pay for the cost of transportation.

02:30.184 --> 02:34.350
This, said Miranda, would be too expensive for the citizens.

02:34.370 --> 02:37.894
A great deal of haggling occurred between Miranda and the others.

02:37.914 --> 02:39.957
There, history deserts us.

02:39.977 --> 02:43.401
It is not known whether such a mine were ever operated or not.

02:43.401 --> 02:51.312
[Music.]

02:51.312 --> 02:57.359
But again, the pages of history open for a brief moment to give us a glimpse of the secret of James Bowie.

02:58.240 --> 03:10.255
One day in November in the year 1831, an expedition of treasure hunters under the leadership of James Bowie was making its way through the Indian country near San Saba Fort.

03:10.275 --> 03:14.400
Bowie's brother, Rezin Bowie, was also a member of the party.

03:17.300 --> 03:23.694
Why, what's the matter, Rezin?

03:24.456 --> 03:30.389
Well, Jim, we set out from San Antonio nearly three weeks ago, and you said we only had to come 150 miles.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.075
Why haven't we found the old mine yet?

03:33.095 --> 03:35.781
I have to examine the nature of the country, Rezin.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.251
Well, you better hurry up, Jim.

03:38.272 --> 03:41.039
I don't like to tarry around here any longer than I have to.

03:41.420 --> 03:45.751
You know, that Comanche we saw last night told us there were some hostile Indians around here.

03:45.932 --> 03:47.034
Don't worry about it.

03:47.576 --> 03:49.922
I know what these lypan Indians are like.

03:50.189 --> 03:54.834
Well, didn't I stay with them myself for months until they showed me where they got that Spanish stuff?

03:55.155 --> 03:57.778
Yeah, but I don't think you'd better run into them again.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.802
You know, Chief Three Hands is after your scalp since you run out on them.

04:01.862 --> 04:05.246
We'll get the silver located and get out of here before too long.

04:05.466 --> 04:06.908
Just as soon as... Hey, boy!

04:07.248 --> 04:08.149
The Indians are coming.

04:08.169 --> 04:09.871
They just shot Jones.

04:09.891 --> 04:12.154
I saw him fall off his horse with an arrow through it.

04:12.394 --> 04:13.055
All right, men.

04:13.215 --> 04:13.936
Give it to them.

04:13.956 --> 04:15.117
There they come over the hill.

04:15.117 --> 04:22.117
[Gunshots.]

04:22.117 --> 04:43.158
[Music.]

04:43.158 --> 04:46.555
Well, I guess the Indians have left us for good.

04:46.935 --> 04:48.558
That was a long fight.

04:49.239 --> 04:50.942
How do we stand, Rezin?

04:51.074 --> 04:53.820
Well, Buckhannon's leg is too bad for him to ride.

04:54.482 --> 04:57.529
We'll have to stay here for at least a week till he gets well enough to ride.

04:57.810 --> 04:59.594
The other three fellows aren't hurt so bad.

05:00.035 --> 05:01.759
Well, we don't have any medicine.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.625
Better put a poultice on Buckhannon's leg.

05:05.347 --> 05:09.336
Boil up some live oak bark and put some charcoal and some meal in it.

05:09.839 --> 05:14.005
After you've bandaged it on, sew some buffalo skin over the bandage.

05:14.025 --> 05:16.970
I guess that's about the best we'll be able to do.

05:16.990 --> 05:18.492
What do we do after his leg heals up?

05:19.033 --> 05:20.775
What can we do now?

05:20.795 --> 05:23.079
We'll just have to hobble back San Antonio.

05:23.079 --> 05:32.032
[Music.]

05:32.032 --> 05:36.759
Down through the years come stories of people finding silver and gold in this region.

05:37.881 --> 05:38.462
One day

05:38.797 --> 05:43.281
Captain Ben McCullough of the Texas Rangers called two of his men into the office.

05:44.142 --> 05:48.025
Dave, I want you and Bill to do some scouting for Indian signs.

05:48.606 --> 05:51.508
Go to the Upper Colorado and work on west from there.

05:51.528 --> 05:51.969
All right.

05:52.129 --> 05:53.150
Any more trouble up there?

05:53.350 --> 05:56.673
I got a report they've been making a few raids up there, Bill.

05:56.693 --> 05:59.075
Thought you boys might go up and see what it's all about.

05:59.215 --> 06:01.077
We'll get started early tomorrow morning.

06:01.097 --> 06:02.318
All right, Dave.

06:02.338 --> 06:04.159
And don't let any Indians lift your scalp.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.340
So long, boys.

06:05.561 --> 06:06.321
So long, Captain.

06:06.381 --> 06:07.082
Be seeing you.

06:07.082 --> 06:16.242
[Music.]

06:16.242 --> 06:19.346
Dave, Dave, are you awake?

06:19.366 --> 06:21.950
Yes, yes, I guess so.

06:21.970 --> 06:25.054
This last week of riding has got me all wore out.

06:25.074 --> 06:26.035
You been up long?

06:26.075 --> 06:26.876
About 20 minutes.

06:27.557 --> 06:28.638
I've been looking for the horses.

06:28.699 --> 06:29.900
I can't find them in this fog.

06:30.281 --> 06:31.923
Sure is foggy out all right.

06:32.443 --> 06:35.147
Wait till I get my boots on and I'll help you hunt.

06:35.167 --> 06:37.050
We'll be sort of out of luck if we don't find them.

06:37.610 --> 06:38.892
About out of water, too.

06:38.892 --> 06:48.271
[Music.]

06:48.271 --> 06:51.537
Dave, my tongue feels like it's a yard long and made out of sand.

06:51.837 --> 06:54.041
We don't sight the horses or some water pretty soon.

06:54.121 --> 06:55.584
I'm going to be done for.

06:56.365 --> 06:59.511
I thought for sure we'd find the horses yesterday after the fog lifted.

06:59.531 --> 07:01.795
Well, maybe we'll be able to see something from this hilltop.

07:02.336 --> 07:03.258
Nothing in back of us.

07:03.999 --> 07:06.784
Second we should say it'll be see the other side.

07:06.844 --> 07:07.565
Yeah, look.

07:08.086 --> 07:10.110
They see that winding line of green down there.

07:10.390 --> 07:11.933
Why, it's sure enough a stream of water.

07:11.933 --> 07:20.080
[Music.]

07:20.080 --> 07:24.245
Ah, that's the best tasting water I ever came across.

07:25.186 --> 07:25.287
Yeah.

07:25.307 --> 07:28.751
Well, if it hadn't have been for this dream, we'd have been goners.

07:28.771 --> 07:31.474
Say, what's that shiny stuff down at the bottom of the pool?

07:31.815 --> 07:33.096
No, no.

07:33.116 --> 07:34.378
Looks just like gold.

07:35.620 --> 07:39.064
Say, Bill, you don't think it is gold, do you?

07:40.125 --> 07:42.308
By gollies, it sure is gold.

07:43.009 --> 07:45.732
We've lost our horses, our saddles, and our guns.

07:46.393 --> 07:48.636
But we've found something better than all of them.

07:49.122 --> 07:49.663
Gold.

07:49.783 --> 07:50.544
It sure is.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.727
Look how heavy it is.

07:52.868 --> 07:56.994
If we can ever get back to civilization, we can get an outfit together and come out here and get this stuff.

07:57.975 --> 07:59.518
I'm going to fill my pockets with it.

07:59.878 --> 08:01.501
If we make it back, we can have it assayed.

08:01.761 --> 08:04.565
Bill, Bill, look over at that crotch in the tree.

08:05.367 --> 08:06.528
What's that sticking out of it?

08:06.849 --> 08:07.850
It's a miner's pick.

08:08.591 --> 08:10.294
It's pointing right toward this pool.

08:11.536 --> 08:14.320
I guess we weren't the first ones to find this river of gold.

08:14.320 --> 08:21.117
[Music.]

08:21.117 --> 08:23.961
The rangers found their way back to civilization all right.

08:24.742 --> 08:31.533
They walked until they saw Pack Saddle Mountain looming up in the distance, and they used it as a landmark to get back home.

08:31.553 --> 08:37.461
A mineral expert told them the gold they had found was drift gold, washed downstream from a mother lode.

08:38.182 --> 08:41.888
The two rangers went back to search for the river of gold and the mother lode.

08:41.908 --> 08:49.960
They found Pack Saddle Mountain, but never in their searching did they again find the old prospector's pick and the golden pool.

08:49.960 --> 09:00.757
[Music.]

09:00.757 --> 09:04.263
This time our treasure appears as the Blanco Mine.

09:04.964 --> 09:08.049
It is said that a Spaniard by the name of Blanco found the mine.

09:08.690 --> 09:11.234
Again, it was lost to the knowledge of man.

09:11.254 --> 09:15.361
Then one day a man came into a Texas town looking for Jim Rowland.

09:15.381 --> 09:16.623
Yeah, I'm Jim Rowland.

09:16.963 --> 09:18.285
What can I do for you?

09:18.305 --> 09:19.487
My name is Cheney.

09:19.928 --> 09:21.110
Can I buy you a drink?

09:21.290 --> 09:22.332
I've got one.

09:22.352 --> 09:25.056
Well, I guess I might as well get down to business.

09:25.177 --> 09:26.038
I might as well.

09:26.423 --> 09:29.767
I hear that you know the location of the old Blanco mine.

09:29.787 --> 09:31.670
I know the location of a mine.

09:31.690 --> 09:34.653
Whether it's the Blanco mine is a matter of opinion.

09:34.673 --> 09:39.639
A fellow down the street was telling me that a man named Larimore found it and showed it to you.

09:39.860 --> 09:40.921
Yeah.

09:40.941 --> 09:41.982
Yeah, Larimore found it.

09:42.423 --> 09:45.707
He was up on Pack Saddle Mountain one day hunting javelinas.

09:46.268 --> 09:48.230
His dogs ran three of them into a den.

09:48.631 --> 09:52.435
When he smoked them out of the den, he found it was an old mine with minerals showing.

09:53.096 --> 09:56.160
Later on, I helped him take about 100 pounds of mineral out of there...

09:56.731 --> 09:59.115
It was lead with a strong percentage of silver in it.

09:59.936 --> 10:03.802
I'm offering you $1,000 to show me the location of that mine.

10:03.822 --> 10:05.645
That's quite a bit of money.

10:05.665 --> 10:09.210
Of course, the mine might be worth a whole lot more than that to you.

10:09.511 --> 10:11.334
I'm willing to take the chance.

10:11.354 --> 10:14.859
You'll get $1,000 for only pointing out the location to me.

10:14.879 --> 10:16.862
Well, I guess there's nothing holding me up.

10:17.423 --> 10:20.087
Larimore got disgusted with this country and left.

10:20.107 --> 10:21.810
He'll never want to do anything with the mine.

10:22.617 --> 10:27.182
Before he left, he told me he was going to leave that mine so well hidden that nobody could find it.

10:27.522 --> 10:30.726
He turned to mountain gullies so it would fill up the mine with silk.

10:30.746 --> 10:32.688
But can you still find the mine?

10:32.708 --> 10:32.888
Yeah.

10:34.490 --> 10:38.194
I carved my initials on the rock that he used to seal up the entrance.

10:38.214 --> 10:43.960
Rowland, I'll give you the thousand dollars for just showing me the location of that rock with your initials.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.942
Mister, you've bought yourself a rock.

10:47.980 --> 10:58.811
Listen, Rowland, we've been walking around this packed saddle mountain until I'm tired of it.

10:59.251 --> 11:00.652
Are you sure you know where you're going?

11:00.853 --> 11:02.114
I know where I'm going already.

11:02.134 --> 11:03.555
Well, I'm tired of fooling around.

11:03.655 --> 11:04.436
I'm tired, too.

11:05.117 --> 11:07.960
You show me that thousand dollars and I'll show you the mine.

11:08.100 --> 11:08.800
No, I know you don't.

11:09.141 --> 11:10.662
I'm paying in advance.

11:10.682 --> 11:14.947
You'll get your money after you show me where that rock with your initials on it is located.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.468
Then you won't find out from me.

11:16.938 --> 11:18.019
I'm going back home.

11:18.019 --> 11:26.051
[Music.]

11:26.051 --> 11:30.977
Say, Rowland, whatever happened to that fellow who's going to buy the old blank old mine from you?

11:31.098 --> 11:32.379
Oh, you mean Cheney.

11:32.399 --> 11:33.921
Yeah, I guess that's his name.

11:34.142 --> 11:41.912
Well, after we got up to Pack Saddle Mountain, he wouldn't show me the thousand dollars until after I showed him the location of the rock marking the entrance.

11:42.553 --> 11:45.057
I got mad and came home.

11:45.077 --> 11:45.257
Heh, heh.

11:45.608 --> 11:48.252
You know, he was a blamed fool.

11:48.272 --> 11:56.103
Just to think, at the very minute I told Cheney to hand over them thousand dollars, I was a-standing right on top of that mine.

11:56.103 --> 12:03.493
[Music.]

12:03.493 --> 12:06.497
This was not the last story of the mysterious mine.

12:07.198 --> 12:11.464
Every few years, there have been new tales arising to stir man's desire.

12:11.950 --> 12:15.975
Sometimes this legendary treasure appears as the Lost San Saba Mine.

12:16.615 --> 12:23.843
Sometimes it is called the Lost Bowie Mine, the Lizard Mine, Los Almagras, or Las Amarias.

12:23.863 --> 12:33.354
But always it is a great treasure there for the taking, awaiting the day when some lucky man may find it.

12:33.354 --> 12:39.521
[Music.]

12:39.521 --> 12:41.383
So much for the ghostly treasure.

12:41.785 --> 12:45.410
let us turn to the more practical wealth which Texans have already found.

12:45.951 --> 12:57.426
Texas has mines which are of real importance to the people of the state, not perhaps so fantastic nor so rich as the lost San Saba mine, but still producing valuable minerals.

12:57.446 --> 13:08.721
Texas mines produce mercury, silver, salt, fuller's earth, graphite, gypsum, clay, asphalt, bituminous rock, coal, limestone, granite, and sand.

13:08.741 --> 13:10.864
Most mines require mine timbers,

13:11.182 --> 13:16.107
Stout wooden timbers to keep the earth in place as the miners take out the hidden riches.

13:16.127 --> 13:23.634
Since long before the days of Miranda, wooden timbers and wooden construction have been vitally important in mining.

13:23.654 --> 13:25.176
According to Director W.E.

13:25.256 --> 13:34.485
White of the Texas Forest Service, thousands of trees from the forests of Texas are cut for mine timbers for use in the state and outside the state.

13:35.206 --> 13:38.269
Other trees are made into lumber to build mine buildings.

13:38.553 --> 13:42.358
and homes for the miners, and into railway ties for mine tracks.

13:43.139 --> 13:49.106
In addition to aiding mining operations, mine timbers bring a cash income to the timberland owners of the state.

13:49.907 --> 13:56.314
Thus, Texas forests work hand in hand with another Texas industry to benefit the people of the state.

14:01.100 --> 14:05.185
A constant supply of timber can build a greater Texas.
