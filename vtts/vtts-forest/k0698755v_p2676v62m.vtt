00:00.000 --> 00:15.337
[Silence.]

00:15.337 --> 00:27.072
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:27.472 --> 00:30.937
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

00:31.317 --> 00:35.302
Hi there, friends, I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:35.322 --> 00:38.226
Glad you could come this way up the trail again today.

00:38.246 --> 00:43.413
So how about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:43.433 --> 00:45.175
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:46.015 --> 00:49.880
That's because we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:49.900 --> 00:54.706
Well, sir, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:55.347 --> 01:00.373
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there, the Sons of the Pioneers.

01:00.993 --> 01:03.276
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail, too.

01:03.817 --> 01:08.763
Now that you're here and comfortably settled, well, here's Lloyd Perryman to speak for the boys.

01:09.164 --> 01:10.085
Well, how do, folks?

01:10.125 --> 01:13.609
This first song we're going to do deals with a couple of outlaws.

01:14.028 --> 01:19.356
It's like what happens when a careless man and nature team up to create wildfire.

01:19.376 --> 01:26.246
Only this is a story about a man who is turned outlaw and a Lobo wolf who is an outlaw from birth.

01:26.967 --> 01:40.887
The Lobo is practically extinct now because the ranchers hunted him down in the old times because of his great ability to kill large numbers of cattle and sheep and even a lot of the wildlife in the prairie country.

01:40.907 --> 01:41.588
This man

01:41.956 --> 01:52.572
is trying to make friends with the Lobo Wolf because he believes that if he can follow the Lobo, that he will guide him up through the shadows, through the foothills, to a safe place from his pursuers.

01:53.093 --> 01:59.682
The song is called Outlaws.

01:59.702 --> 02:10.078
Outlaw. Lobo.

02:15.335 --> 02:18.831
Lo, bo, wild wolf

02:19.300 --> 02:48.328
Outlaw of your tribe. Fear not this outlaw, Lobo. Turn not from my side. I know you're lonesome. Come show me where you hide. Just two lonesome outlaws, Lobo, wandering far and wide.

02:48.308 --> 02:57.762
Lobo, wild wolf, what crime did you do?

02:57.782 --> 03:00.927
Are you really outlaw, Lobo?

03:01.588 --> 03:04.172
Are the stories true?

03:05.434 --> 03:12.004
They call you devil, a clever devil too.

03:13.165 --> 03:20.724
Then wait for this outlaw lobo and I'll follow you.

03:26.038 --> 03:30.128
Ooh, lobo, wild wolf, outlaw lobo.

03:38.697 --> 03:44.628
Ooh, lobo. Where can we go and never hear?

03:44.648 --> 03:48.174
There's the outlaw.

03:48.194 --> 03:54.866
Lobo, wild wolf, go you silently.

03:56.368 --> 04:03.000
Off to the foothills in the shadow of each tree.

04:04.111 --> 04:11.180
You know there's danger, the danger I can't see.

04:12.141 --> 04:16.527
But you're not the outlaw, lobo.

04:16.867 --> 04:19.651
This time they want me.

04:25.097 --> 04:28.962
Ooh, lobo, wild wolf, outlaw, lobo.

04:31.085 --> 04:31.165
Ooh lobo. 

04:37.726 --> 04:56.873
Run, run, run, lobo, and hide. Outlaw.

04:57.854 --> 05:00.578
Wonderful song, isn't it?

05:00.598 --> 05:01.940
You know, I was just thinking, friend.

05:02.621 --> 05:07.227
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could really outlaw wildfire and make it stick?

05:08.506 --> 05:13.794
I think maybe that'll happen sometime, but it'll take folks being more careful than ever to bring it about.

05:15.236 --> 05:21.366
Have you ever given much thought to what happens to the wild things in the woods and forest when fire runs through?

05:22.568 --> 05:30.740
Well, sir, fire robs them of their source of food when it destroys the trees and shrubs and other plants that they get their food from.

05:30.760 --> 05:35.087
And sometimes a fast-running fire will kill young and adult animals alike.

05:36.080 --> 05:40.145
And in almost every forest and woodland there are hollow trees.

05:40.165 --> 05:45.711
Now we call them den trees because the birds and small animals make their homes in them.

05:45.731 --> 05:48.254
Fire destroys these homes of the wildlife.

05:49.395 --> 05:53.079
The fish in the streams feel the effects of forest fires too.

05:53.099 --> 05:56.663
Often the heat is so intense it kills the fish outright.

05:56.683 --> 05:58.605
And then there's the silt and the debris.

05:59.346 --> 06:02.209
Now when these get into the streams the water is polluted.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.833
Please think about these things next time you're outdoors.

06:05.999 --> 06:09.909
have to use fire in one form or another, will you?

06:09.929 --> 06:16.386
Now the sons of the pioneers are going to express their own feelings about what happens to the wildlife when a forest burns.

06:16.406 --> 06:21.038
It's an instrumental number and they call it Blues in A. Ready, boys?

06:21.038 --> 07:48.009
[Music.]

07:48.009 --> 07:55.165
You know, friends, there's no end to the damage a forest fire can do.

07:56.107 --> 08:00.253
We've talked about what it does to the timber and water and to the wildlife.

08:01.034 --> 08:07.243
But what about the effect of fire on the beauty of our forests and on the recreational areas?

08:07.263 --> 08:10.067
In a very short time, we, through carelessness,

08:10.385 --> 08:14.990
can destroy what took nature many, many years to build up.

08:15.010 --> 08:20.617
When fire strikes, the beauty of the forest is replaced by a raw, frightful mess.

08:21.538 --> 08:26.323
Favorite picnic and hunting areas and peaceful camping spots are often ruined.

08:27.444 --> 08:29.487
You know, friends, it all comes down to this.

08:30.147 --> 08:31.769
I know you've heard me say it before.

08:32.450 --> 08:36.835
It doesn't matter who we are or what we do or what our special interests are.

08:37.676 --> 08:39.598
When the woods and forests burn,

08:39.848 --> 08:45.314
We lose, you and I. Everyone loses when fire burns.

08:45.915 --> 08:47.376
Well, you can say that again, Billy.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.980
Everyone does lose when fire burns.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.343
I had a real dose of this a while back.

08:53.363 --> 08:54.964
Had planned a fishing trip for weeks.

08:55.064 --> 09:02.392
Finally, the big day came, and I headed up to a favorite spot of mine where the water always ran clear and fast through the forest.

09:02.853 --> 09:03.373
And the trout?

09:04.014 --> 09:07.017
Brother, I never missed bringing home a full catch.

09:07.658 --> 09:09.400
But this time I'm telling you about, well,

09:10.055 --> 09:12.578
When I saw the old place, it just made me heart sick.

09:13.059 --> 09:15.522
You can't imagine how awful it was, Billy.

09:15.542 --> 09:19.127
Some careless guy let a fire get away in that country.

09:19.908 --> 09:26.276
My favorite fishing stream was just a dry, pebbly run in a forest that had become a graveyard of trees.

09:26.377 --> 09:32.485
And there was the remains of a deer, a big fella at that, laying across the trail.

09:32.505 --> 09:38.813
And all I could think of was, how in the name of heaven can a person be so careless?

09:39.232 --> 09:42.397
Come on, boys, let's sing.

09:43.038 --> 10:08.935
Take a look at the sky where the whippoorwill trills And the mountains so high where the cataracts build. Take a look at the falls and the rippling rills. Hear the wanderlust calls of the whispering hills. The rippling rills, the cataracts build, the whippoorwill trills.

10:09.708 --> 10:15.074
The rippling rills, the cataracts build, the whippoorwill trills.

10:15.094 --> 10:20.099
The rippling rills, the cataracts build, the whippoorwill trills.

10:20.119 --> 10:24.905
Let me live on the range where the tumbleweeds grow.

10:25.325 --> 10:29.910
Let the silver sand shake where the prairie winds blow.

10:30.551 --> 10:32.593
Let the wanderer sing where the wanderers go.

10:32.573 --> 10:39.763
Let the melody ring, for he's happy I know.

10:39.803 --> 10:43.708
The wanderers go, the prairie winds blow, the tumbleweeds grow.

10:44.209 --> 10:50.437
The wanderers go, the prairie winds blow, the tumbleweeds grow.

10:50.457 --> 10:55.003
The wanderers go, the prairie winds blow, the tumbleweeds grow.

10:55.203 --> 11:00.078
Let me follow the trail where the buffalo roams.

11:00.680 --> 11:05.234
Let a silver cloud sail where the satin sun shone.

11:05.937 --> 11:08.284
Let the lobo wolf wail

11:09.091 --> 11:15.279
A broken heart tone. Let it storm, let it gale, till the prairie's my home.

11:15.299 --> 11:20.265
A broken heart tone, the satin sun shone, the buffalo roam.

11:20.285 --> 11:26.152
A broken heart tone, the satin sun shone, the buffalo roam.

11:26.172 --> 11:29.817
The rippling rills, the cataracts build, the whippoorwill trills. 

11:29.797 --> 11:59.702
The wanderers go, the prairie winds blow, the tumbleweeds grow. A broken heart tone, the satin sun shone, the buffalo roam. That kind of song makes me think about how lonesome and dreary it is when you walk through a burned forest or woodland. The prairie's my home.

12:00.644 --> 12:04.710
There'd be a lot less forest fires if we practiced what Smokey Bear preaches.

12:05.731 --> 12:07.634
And here he is now, coming up the trail.

12:08.235 --> 12:09.116
Let's listen, huh?

12:10.398 --> 12:13.562
Hello there, folks.

12:13.582 --> 12:17.928
Seems like I'm always asking you good people to do something.

12:17.948 --> 12:21.032
But then, it's for your own good.

12:21.052 --> 12:24.137
Now I've got a special request.

12:24.157 --> 12:30.145
If you're a fisherman or a hunter, a person who likes to picnic or camp outdoors,

12:30.580 --> 12:37.447
or if you make your living out of the forest, take a long look in the nearest mirror.

12:38.448 --> 12:39.349
Will you do that?

12:40.530 --> 12:44.794
Now, ask the person you see in that mirror this question.

12:46.115 --> 12:51.480
Are you always careful with fire outdoors?

12:51.500 --> 12:55.925
I sure hope the answer is yes.

12:55.945 --> 12:59.288
Well, I'll be seen here.

13:00.365 --> 13:02.887
And there it goes down the trail.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.209
Thank you, Smokey.

13:05.229 --> 13:09.033
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:09.973 --> 13:12.696
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:13.617 --> 13:22.805
You know it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:23.685 --> 13:28.630
Until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear said.

13:28.650 --> 13:30.051
Remember, only we.

13:30.368 --> 13:33.792
you and I can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:34.954 --> 13:45.888
Well, so long for now from Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and from those wonderful fellows who sing your favorite songs of the outdoors the way you like to hear them, the sons of the pioneers.

13:46.469 --> 13:50.554
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

13:50.872 --> 14:03.717
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name

14:04.034 --> 14:12.227
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:12.968 --> 14:16.633
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:17.014 --> 14:21.060
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:21.581 --> 14:25.587
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:25.853 --> 14:29.638
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:30.279 --> 14:34.065
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:34.445 --> 14:38.431
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:39.012 --> 14:43.238
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:43.218 --> 14:56.316
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:56.316 --> 15:31.000
[Music.]

15:31.000 --> 15:47.000
[Silence.]
