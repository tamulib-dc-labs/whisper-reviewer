00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
[Silence.]

00:08.000 --> 00:22.323
[Music.]

00:22.323 --> 00:24.386
Well, howdy, friends.

00:24.406 --> 00:27.250
Let's see, here it is time again.

00:27.270 --> 00:30.795
This old Jelly Elliott and the three knothead.

00:30.815 --> 00:34.600
Sitting here on the old pine tree down the trail here.

00:34.620 --> 00:39.507
We're just glad as we can be that you've come our way for the next 14 minutes.

00:39.527 --> 00:47.237
We're going to play you some of these hillbilly tunes, maybe some of them that you'll like, some new ones, some old ones, and some old ones.

00:47.257 --> 00:48.319
So just stick around.

00:48.359 --> 00:49.360
Stay with us, Spell.

00:52.613 --> 01:03.630
Well, we're just as glad as we can be to be back here with you, friends, and we're mighty glad to have all of you come along down the trail with us.

01:04.351 --> 01:12.263
Yeah, we come along just every so often here, same station, same place here.

01:12.464 --> 01:21.237
Yeah, we come to you, friends, through the courtesy and wishes and possibilities and functions and posknowledge of the

01:21.740 --> 01:29.505
Forestry Service, State Forestry Service, you know, them forestry boys and Uncle Sam's Forestry Service.

01:29.975 --> 01:39.908
Yeah, we got a lot that we're going to tell you here in a few minutes or discuss or in trust or something other with you in just a minute.

01:39.928 --> 01:41.450
First, we're going to play a hoedown here.

01:41.470 --> 01:42.971
We're going to get Bob.

01:43.232 --> 01:43.672
Robert.

01:44.313 --> 01:44.794
Robert.

01:44.814 --> 01:45.735
Yeah, me too.

01:45.755 --> 01:46.916
I love who?

01:47.117 --> 01:47.878
No, I don't.

01:47.898 --> 01:48.198
Yeah.

01:48.699 --> 01:50.982
Well, Robert's going to play a hoedown here.

01:51.122 --> 01:53.745
All you old timers, this is played especially for you.

01:53.825 --> 01:55.768
I know there's a lot of you old hoedown breakdown.

01:55.808 --> 01:57.670
They call them hoedowns nowadays, but

01:58.072 --> 01:59.324
There ain't nothing but a breakdown.

01:59.647 --> 02:00.798
Here's Robert to play one.

02:00.818 --> 02:01.686
Sally Gooden.

02:53.624 --> 03:00.238
Well, thank you, Robert.

03:00.258 --> 03:00.679
Thank you.

03:00.980 --> 03:01.821
There it was, friends.

03:01.842 --> 03:03.906
There's an old ditty there called Sally Gooden.

03:03.966 --> 03:06.592
I know all of you out there remember old Sally Gooden.

03:07.133 --> 03:11.282
Yeah, I can remember a long time ago, Mama used to get the old fiddle out, you know.

03:11.302 --> 03:12.865
You ought to hear Mama play a fiddle.

03:13.148 --> 03:19.934
Oh, boy, she's one of the few that I've ever seen can play a fiddle, play a hoedown, and sing and dance.

03:20.315 --> 03:23.157
Dance this regular old flat foot tap dance.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.158
All at the same time.

03:24.899 --> 03:25.960
She's quite a character.

03:25.980 --> 03:36.450
You know, I can remember when I was a little boy, she used to get out the old fiddle, and I'd get the guitar, and boy, we'd play Sally Goodman, Leather Britches, and all them old tunes like that.

03:37.030 --> 03:42.295
Yeah, and you know, that was about 50, 40 years ago too, wasn't it?

03:42.595 --> 03:47.740
Well, you know, I was just thinking, and I don't want to think too hard.

03:47.800 --> 03:48.941
I'll probably get hurt.

03:49.762 --> 03:59.211
It's a hard matter for me to think, but speaking about old times and way back there, these forest fires and things, that all ties in together.

03:59.311 --> 04:03.455
Ticks and snakes and weevils, you know, bull weevils, all that sort of stuff.

04:04.456 --> 04:11.202
I can remember a long time ago, my grandfather, every year he used to go out there and burn off the

04:11.536 --> 04:25.373
turn roads and burn off all the woods around the place and burn up all the timber and all, called himself burning off the, killing the ticks, killing the ticks out of the woods so they wouldn't eat up the cows and all that sort of stuff.

04:25.994 --> 04:28.497
And I'll declare, I just think now how foolish that was.

04:28.517 --> 04:36.868
Of course, my grandpa was a very sensible man, but in one way, but he didn't have too much sense when he thought he could burn up the ticks by burning off the wood.

04:37.523 --> 04:42.489
Why, to burn up the ticks, he'd have to catch all the cows and burn them up.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.554
Did you know, friends, that turtles have ticks on them?

04:46.574 --> 04:47.355
That's a fact.

04:47.395 --> 04:49.197
So help me, turtles have ticks on them.

04:49.677 --> 04:53.101
The way to kill ticks is to dip the cows, not burn off the wood.

04:53.121 --> 04:57.306
You burn up all the timber trying to kill the ticks, and that's the foolishest thing.

04:57.326 --> 04:58.428
You can't burn up ticks.

04:59.088 --> 05:00.009
Snakes.

05:00.029 --> 05:02.232
Now, a lot of people burn off the woods and

05:02.600 --> 05:06.023
And on account of snakes, they claim they're killing off the snakes.

05:06.264 --> 05:10.568
Why, you never burn up a snake unless you hem him up in a brush heap and burn him up in there.

05:11.248 --> 05:12.189
And then you have to watch him.

05:12.209 --> 05:13.010
He'll come out of there.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.854
I guarantee you can set a brush heap on fire and say, snake, now he'll come out.

05:17.334 --> 05:18.155
You have to throw him back.

05:18.335 --> 05:19.456
You can't burn up snakes.

05:19.496 --> 05:20.377
They burn off the wood.

05:20.397 --> 05:24.221
They go in a hole, and they go up in old holler, dirty logs.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.584
It's wet in there, and you get up in there and wait till the fire's over, and then he comes out.

05:28.765 --> 05:29.586
And weevils.

05:29.988 --> 05:30.308
Yeah.

05:30.489 --> 05:35.555
Now, Grandpa used to claim if he'd burn off the woods all around the field, well, he'd burn up the weevils.

05:35.575 --> 05:37.958
And I declare the bull weevils eat up the cotton every year.

05:38.078 --> 05:40.001
The more he'd burn, the more bull weevils it was.

05:40.021 --> 05:41.342
You can't burn up bull weevils.

05:41.362 --> 05:42.804
They're out there in them cotton patches.

05:43.585 --> 05:49.853
They're holed up in them faulty bulls and things that fell off there, and they go down in the ground.

05:50.153 --> 05:51.515
And I'll tell you something else you can do.

05:51.535 --> 05:58.043
You can go out in the woods, around the turn roads, and you can dig into an old, wet, soggy stump, and you'll find them boll weevils in there.

05:58.063 --> 06:00.326
Now, you can't burn up one of them kind of stumps.

06:00.346 --> 06:02.168
You can't hurt a boll weevil by burning.

06:02.689 --> 06:03.770
That's foolish.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.774
You burn up thousands of dollars there.

06:06.794 --> 06:14.423
Maybe it's your own property, but you burn up thousands of dollars worth of timber to try to raise a 10-cent stalk of cotton.

06:14.443 --> 06:19.249
Now, friends, getting serious, that's a serious proposition, if you'll just stop to think.

06:20.022 --> 06:31.132
If you'll handle, if you've got a five-acre track of timber there, and you'll get a hold of that old forestry boy there in your neighborhood, he's around there somewhere, and he's a country boy too.

06:31.152 --> 06:32.494
I'll tell you that before you start.

06:32.514 --> 06:40.681
He's a good country boy, and he's put there, he's hired by your government and your state to work for you, to help you.

06:41.262 --> 06:47.127
Now, friends, we know that timber is one of the best crops that we've got.

06:47.410 --> 06:50.833
And it'll bring a lot of fun, jobs, and real money to a community.

06:51.073 --> 06:51.814
You all know that.

06:51.974 --> 06:54.897
Well, I could stand here and tell you 30 minutes.

06:55.057 --> 07:03.304
I could talk 30 minutes and who all gets a little dab out of a dollar made off of a saw log or a stick of pulpwood.

07:03.324 --> 07:08.188
It goes right on up to Wall Street in Washington and back down here and back up there and back and forward.

07:09.049 --> 07:12.632
And you just, well, I just ain't got time to tell you all about it.

07:12.672 --> 07:13.733
We're going to play a tune.

07:13.753 --> 07:15.595
Slim, you going to sing this next song?

07:15.676 --> 07:18.925
Yeah, you're going to sing this song for all of the mothers.

07:18.945 --> 07:21.653
And we do hope that there's a lot of them out there listening.

07:21.673 --> 07:23.418
And mothers, we'd like to hear from you too.

07:23.458 --> 07:26.426
And here's Slim to sing a song especially for you.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.993
And it's Rockin' Alone in an Old Rockin' Chair.

07:38.660 --> 07:58.170
I saw She seems so neglected by those who should care

08:00.361 --> 08:22.386
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair Her hands were callous, wrinkled and old A life of hard work was the storm

08:26.213 --> 08:41.024
I think of angels as I see her there, rocking alone in an old rocking chair.

08:42.587 --> 08:45.994
Oh, I look at her.

08:46.430 --> 08:58.526
And I think what a shame, the ones who forgot her, she loves just the same.

08:59.307 --> 09:07.999
Oh, I think of Angel as I see her there.

09:07.979 --> 09:18.885
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair.

09:18.905 --> 09:19.927
Well, there it is, mothers.

09:20.007 --> 09:21.832
We hope that you've enjoyed that tune.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.237
Slim sang it, and we'd like to do it again for you.

09:24.318 --> 09:25.380
We'd like to hear from you.

09:26.069 --> 09:28.533
Well, we're going to get Slim to come up here next, I believe.

09:28.573 --> 09:29.114
No, Robert.

09:29.154 --> 09:30.776
Robert's going to sing this next time.

09:30.816 --> 09:31.197
Yes, sir.

09:31.257 --> 09:34.141
He's going to come up here and give forth with a sad little ditty.

09:34.161 --> 09:35.924
Robert's got a cultivated voice.

09:36.024 --> 09:39.990
It's all been broke up and heard and everything, plowed and all.

09:40.010 --> 09:43.014
And he's going to strain forth here with this next tune.

09:43.996 --> 09:44.837
And...

09:45.391 --> 09:49.495
Before he does, though, friends, I would like to remind you again about them fires.

09:49.556 --> 09:55.402
They're burning off the woods to kill weevils and snakes and things like that, and to scare off the ghosts.

09:55.522 --> 10:08.796
I've heard of such a thing as people being scared of spirits, haints, ghosts, and things, and they burn off all the brush and undergrowth and stuff around the house to keep the ghosts and spirits and haints scared off.

10:08.837 --> 10:09.838
Ain't that silly?

10:09.858 --> 10:11.680
That's just plain ignorance.

10:11.700 --> 10:12.040
Yeah.

10:12.357 --> 10:13.338
He better watch out.

10:13.358 --> 10:18.566
The booger will catch him all right if he ain't got no more sense than that, to try to burn off the woods to scare off the ghost.

10:19.147 --> 10:21.711
Something glob will catch him and won't turn him loose either.

10:21.991 --> 10:23.894
Robert, you ready to sing?

10:23.934 --> 10:24.655
What you going to sing?

10:25.496 --> 10:26.718
No, no, no.

10:26.738 --> 10:28.581
I want you to sing right now.

10:28.601 --> 10:29.622
You going to sing right now?

10:29.642 --> 10:32.226
Oh, you going to sing tomorrow night and right now too, huh?

10:32.246 --> 10:33.267
Oh, that's the name of the tune.

10:33.287 --> 10:34.970
Here's Robert here to sing tomorrow night.

10:34.970 --> 10:44.048
[Music.]

10:44.048 --> 11:07.390
Tomorrow night you'll have another sweetheart Tomorrow night you'll have somebody new I'm a fool to think you're indiscreet heart

11:07.758 --> 11:37.765
Would ever love someone with love that's true You love me in your mind and not your heart, dear And you'll change your mind tomorrow night For I see you smiling at another

11:37.745 --> 11:47.299
Another love you'll have tomorrow night

12:17.452 --> 12:45.400
Tonight we are together, but I know, dear And others' arms are sure to hold you tight For I see you smiling at another And others love you how tomorrow

12:45.818 --> 12:50.885
Thank you, Robert, thank you.

12:50.905 --> 12:58.776
There it is, friends, Robert Chivers, one of the pine knots, knotheads, that is, doing some horror knots.

12:58.796 --> 12:59.257
Excuse me.

13:00.018 --> 13:02.822
Muswaller knot, there it goes again, trying to take part in the program.

13:04.043 --> 13:04.464
Let's see.

13:04.904 --> 13:08.129
Yeah, friends, we'd like to hear from you.

13:08.489 --> 13:14.037
If you like this mess up here, this is about the best we can do.

13:14.287 --> 13:16.230
We're not ashamed of it a bit.

13:16.550 --> 13:17.932
We ain't bragging about it, though.

13:18.012 --> 13:22.037
And if you like it, wouldn't like to hear some more of it, we'd like to hear from you.

13:22.518 --> 13:24.561
Just write us a penny postcard or letter.

13:25.342 --> 13:27.024
Just sit down there and take a minute off.

13:27.044 --> 13:30.409
Any of you little rabbit twisters out there going to school would like to hear a tune.

13:30.749 --> 13:32.311
Just write us a card or letter.

13:32.331 --> 13:36.837
Address your fan mail to Jelly Elliott and the three knotheads.

13:36.857 --> 13:37.578
Three knotheads.

13:37.598 --> 13:38.960
That's easy to remember, ain't it?

13:38.980 --> 13:40.562
And I mean they're knotheads, too.

13:40.582 --> 13:42.505
Their heads look like a sack of hickernuts.

13:42.805 --> 13:43.546
That's the truth.

13:43.566 --> 13:46.149
These are knotheadless old boys, including myself.

13:47.631 --> 13:48.653
We'd like to hear from you.

13:48.673 --> 13:49.794
Just write to us.

13:49.834 --> 13:52.918
Send it to the station that you're now listening to.

13:53.078 --> 13:54.620
And don't forget, we'll be back with you.

13:55.061 --> 13:56.563
Yeah, we'll be back.

13:56.623 --> 14:01.429
So you listen to your announcer, and he'll let you know just what day we're going to be back here.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.954
Here's just a little thought I'd like to leave with you before we go.

14:05.455 --> 14:08.138
A burning woods is a burning change.

14:09.535 --> 14:12.220
Friends, that takes up all the time we've got today.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.203
We've got to move on down the trail.

14:14.243 --> 14:18.109
We've really enjoyed sitting here under the old pine tree playing for you.

14:18.750 --> 14:30.270
And again, we want to tell you that it's made possible for us to play for you on these programs by your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's forestry service.

14:30.290 --> 14:35.138
And now remember, friends, that only you can prevent wood stars.

14:35.138 --> 14:55.466
[Music.]
