00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
[Silence.]

00:13.000 --> 00:27.284
[Music.]

00:27.284 --> 00:35.158
The Texas Forest Service of A&M College presents a dramatization of an incident in early Texas history in the year 1836.

00:35.358 --> 00:37.993
Mr. Booth's Sawmill.

00:37.993 --> 01:02.266
[Music.]

01:02.266 --> 01:03.307
All right, Jack.

01:03.327 --> 01:04.949
Have the men drive that piling deep.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.611
We want it strong enough to hold.

01:06.671 --> 01:07.673
Yes, sir, Mr. Booth.

01:07.913 --> 01:08.634
It's steady.

01:08.654 --> 01:11.697
You won't have to worry about having your sawmill shaking off this piling.

01:12.058 --> 01:14.321
This cypress will hold anything we want to put on it.

01:14.341 --> 01:14.621
Good.

01:15.102 --> 01:17.184
I want to start cutting lumber as soon as possible.

01:17.485 --> 01:20.348
Some of the settlers are putting in orders for boards already.

01:20.368 --> 01:23.692
I hope we get a chance to finish it, but I'm a fear to trouble.

01:23.712 --> 01:24.653
What's the matter?

01:24.673 --> 01:26.936
Have you heard anything more about that Mexican general?

01:27.016 --> 01:27.417
Yes.

01:27.697 --> 01:31.041
An Indian came through last night heading over back towards New Orleans.

01:31.021 --> 01:36.009
He said Santa Ana had taken Goliad and General Houston was falling back after burning the town.

01:36.290 --> 01:38.954
The Indians said Houston had lost most of his men.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.637
He had only 400 to begin with.

01:41.418 --> 01:43.141
Well, I hope the Indian's wrong.

01:43.161 --> 01:46.547
You don't know these days what to believe with all these wild stories around.

01:47.108 --> 01:50.373
The settlers are all afraid to do much because of the Indians in the north.

01:50.393 --> 01:53.198
I was hoping that Santa Ana would decide to let us alone.

01:53.178 --> 01:59.972
Well, he probably thinks he'll have to do something now after we declared Texas a republic last month and elected Burnett president.

02:00.494 --> 02:03.640
He may lose his hold on all of Mexico if he lets Texas break off.

02:03.841 --> 02:05.143
Just a minute, Mr. Booth.

02:05.745 --> 02:09.172
Hey, Zeke, will you cut that cross piece off flesh with the other side?

02:09.352 --> 02:10.174
Sure will, Jack.

02:10.272 --> 02:16.479
I tell you, Mr. Booth, if we still had a man like old President Victoria running Mexico, we probably wouldn't be having any trouble now.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.762
We got along all right under him.

02:18.782 --> 02:21.085
Yes, he did whatever he could for us.

02:21.105 --> 02:28.794
But when Santa Anna got in power, called himself dictator, and scrapped the Constitution of 1824, I knew we were going to have our hands full.

02:29.255 --> 02:31.397
He's taken away any liberties we did have.

02:31.417 --> 02:32.158
Say, Jack.

02:32.178 --> 02:32.959
Yes, Zeke.

02:32.979 --> 02:35.402
He wants this flanking bolted down and should manail it.

02:35.467 --> 02:36.749
What do you think, Mr. Booth?

02:37.430 --> 02:39.713
Well, I should think we'd better bolt it.

02:39.733 --> 02:43.458
It will probably hold down the vibration a little and it won't pull apart easily.

02:43.518 --> 02:44.599
Bolt it down, Zeke.

02:44.879 --> 02:45.580
All right, Jack.

02:45.881 --> 02:53.952
You know, Mr. Booth, I still can't see why President Burnett moved the capital from Washington up on the Brazos River down to Harrisburg.

02:53.972 --> 03:00.620
He probably wants to have the government headquarters close to the sea now so he can get men and supplies from New Orleans if he needs them.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.862
I suppose so.

03:01.842 --> 03:04.807
It probably don't make the people over in the west feel any better.

03:05.247 --> 03:07.431
Of course, we're close here to the Louisiana border.

03:07.871 --> 03:11.857
I hope we get some news soon that Sam Houston is chasing them back out of the country.

03:11.877 --> 03:15.823
Otherwise, all the settlers will be packing up their belongings and clearing out of the country again.

03:16.044 --> 03:17.907
They've done that often enough already.

03:17.927 --> 03:19.429
That isn't going to do any good.

03:19.409 --> 03:23.853
My wife was trying to talk me into moving back across the border into Louisiana again last night.

03:24.094 --> 03:27.096
But I told her it's time we stood up to Santa Ana once and for all.

03:27.317 --> 03:30.840
Well, we licked them once at Nacogdoches, and we can do it again if we have to.

03:31.180 --> 03:35.044
Yeah, the trouble was that we didn't catch enough of Santa Ana's men that last time.

03:35.064 --> 03:38.708
Well, it might be that General Houston's got them on the run again by this time.

03:39.048 --> 03:39.549
Might be.

03:40.590 --> 03:43.172
Say, Mr. Booth, look at that rider coming down the trail.

03:43.232 --> 03:44.633
He's whipping his horse to a lather.

03:44.774 --> 03:45.855
He's sure enough in a hurry.

03:46.115 --> 03:47.256
What if there's anything wrong?

03:55.285 --> 03:56.186
What's your hurry?

03:56.707 --> 03:57.468
Santa Ana.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.451
He's moving up with nearly 2,000 men.

04:00.052 --> 04:02.156
General Sam Houston has fallen back this way.

04:02.736 --> 04:05.921
We're going to try to stop the Mexicans on the Trinity or the Santa Center.

04:06.182 --> 04:07.343
Where is Santa Ana now?

04:07.363 --> 04:09.467
Don't know for sure, but we heard he left, Gonzales.

04:09.767 --> 04:10.949
Is the town still standing?

04:11.229 --> 04:12.491
I think they burned it.

04:12.511 --> 04:15.977
We'll need all the volunteers we can get this time or he'll burn us all out.

04:15.997 --> 04:17.639
Where are we supposed to meet Houston?

04:17.659 --> 04:22.086
The settlers are all heading straight west of here, but Houston may still be south nearer to Harrisburg.

04:22.488 --> 04:27.433
If you keep them down on this trail, there'll be somebody on the way to tell you where to go, or there'll be signs left.

04:27.954 --> 04:29.575
Are there any more settlers up this road?

04:29.875 --> 04:32.258
There's another camp on the far side of this hill.

04:32.278 --> 04:32.999
Are you going on?

04:33.239 --> 04:35.481
I've got orders to get everybody who'll join us.

04:35.501 --> 04:37.783
If you're going, take all the shot and powder you have.

04:38.304 --> 04:39.225
I'm heading on now.

04:39.745 --> 04:40.086
Get in!

04:43.329 --> 04:45.051
Hey, what do we do, Mr. Booth?

04:45.391 --> 04:47.373
Well, looks like my sawmill will have to wait.

04:47.613 --> 04:49.355
We've got a more important job to do.

04:49.936 --> 04:51.297
Give me your attention, men.

04:51.665 --> 04:54.248
Seemed like this time I got to stop Santa Ana for good.

04:54.849 --> 04:56.330
Who wants to go help Sam Houston?

04:58.673 --> 05:04.339
Throw your tools in the shed, then, and some of you load the food and the gunpowder and bullets in the wagon.

05:04.660 --> 05:05.180
Let's go.

05:05.220 --> 05:08.904
Henry, help me with these sides of bacon.

05:08.904 --> 05:28.688
[Music.]

05:28.688 --> 05:30.571
Hey, mister, which way is Sam Houston?

05:30.731 --> 05:31.993
He's still south of here.

05:32.013 --> 05:34.698
Take the next fork to the left and straight on.

05:34.718 --> 05:36.200
You'll run into somebody up there.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.433
Maybe Santa Ana.

05:37.433 --> 05:50.503
[Music.]

05:50.503 --> 05:53.788
General Houston, 15 more volunteers have joined us from New Orleans.

05:54.089 --> 05:54.409
Good.

05:54.794 --> 05:56.117
How many does that make us now?

05:56.278 --> 05:58.143
783, all told, sir.

05:58.363 --> 05:59.125
Officers and men.

05:59.506 --> 06:01.452
We can use every man we can get.

06:02.254 --> 06:04.098
I figure the enemy has upwards of 1,500.

06:04.179 --> 06:07.287
Well, assign these men to Burleson.

06:07.407 --> 06:07.888
Yes, sir.

06:07.909 --> 06:08.330
And Horton.

06:08.490 --> 06:08.871
Yes, sir.

06:09.188 --> 06:11.070
Are there any changes in the enemy's position?

06:11.370 --> 06:12.091
No, sir.

06:12.111 --> 06:17.055
Our scouts say the right flank of their infantry is still extended to occupy the bank of the San Jacinto.

06:17.076 --> 06:19.758
Their left is secured by cavalry and a low fortification.

06:20.158 --> 06:24.282
The artillery is in the center and occasionally firing at us, but we're still out of range.

06:24.543 --> 06:25.103
Very good.

06:25.804 --> 06:29.047
Now, when we begin the attack, I expect to drive them back.

06:29.067 --> 06:33.091
To stop any retreat, I want you to send some men to cut Vince's bridge.

06:33.671 --> 06:36.154
It's about eight miles from here, so they'd better start at once.

06:36.494 --> 06:37.575
I'll send them right out, sir.

06:37.994 --> 06:40.878
Then at half past three o'clock, we'll parade the men.

06:40.898 --> 06:43.082
We'll march them into the following plan for attack.

06:43.823 --> 06:46.086
Burleson and his first regiment in the center.

06:46.847 --> 06:49.772
Sherman with his second regiment on the left wing.

06:49.792 --> 06:52.776
The artillery under Harkley will be on the right of the first regiment.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.483
And Millard with his four companies of infantry will be on the right.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.269
The cavalry under Lamar will be on our extreme right.

07:01.289 --> 07:02.010
Do you have that clear?

07:02.130 --> 07:02.871
Quite clear, sir.

07:03.222 --> 07:12.019
At half past four o'clock, our cavalry will be dispatched to the front on the enemy's left to attract his attention, to cover our artillery and giving us time to start the forward movement.

07:12.019 --> 07:19.706
[Music.]

07:19.706 --> 07:22.010
Forward men, follow me.

07:22.010 --> 07:38.153
[Sound effects.]

07:38.153 --> 07:39.054
Miller.

07:39.074 --> 07:40.036
Yes, Colonel Hockley.

07:40.196 --> 07:41.738
Lamar is moving up with his cavalry.

07:41.798 --> 07:46.544
We'll have to take our six-pointers up to 200 yards of the enemy and give them the grape and canister.

07:46.564 --> 07:46.985
Yes, sir.

07:47.225 --> 07:48.247
All right, men, forward.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.676
The regiment's ready, Colonel Sherman.

07:54.756 --> 07:55.236
Very good.

07:55.256 --> 07:55.997
Peabody.

07:56.017 --> 07:56.818
Just a moment, Sherman.

07:57.099 --> 07:58.320
Yes, sir, General Houston.

07:58.461 --> 07:59.702
I'll lead the infantry charge.

08:01.024 --> 08:06.051
Men, we will advance within point-blank range before firing.

08:06.807 --> 08:07.648
No more quick.

08:07.809 --> 08:08.369
Time.

08:10.773 --> 08:11.014
Fire!

08:11.254 --> 08:22.191
General Houston, that musket fire is for us.

08:22.471 --> 08:23.874
We'll keep on until we're nearer.

08:24.454 --> 08:26.357
I'll give the order to fire in just a moment.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.881
All right, men.

08:29.903 --> 08:31.245
Fire!

08:37.030 --> 08:38.592
Peabody, General Houston is wounded.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.975
Take care of him.

08:40.995 --> 08:41.776
Go on, Sherman.

08:41.816 --> 08:46.962
Don't stop for me.

08:46.982 --> 08:51.587
Watch out, Colonel, behind that... It's all right, Peabody.

08:51.828 --> 08:53.490
I got him.

08:53.510 --> 08:55.832
It looks as if the enemy's dropping back, Colonel Peabody.

08:55.993 --> 08:56.974
I think we're making progress.

08:57.835 --> 09:00.838
Hey, the enemy's cannon ain't doing him much good in this skirmish.

09:00.858 --> 09:03.882
If Lamar gets through the line fast enough, we'll soon flush him out of cover.

09:04.621 --> 09:05.972
The enemy's dropping back over there.

09:06.517 --> 09:07.344
We're turning his plank.

09:07.565 --> 09:09.703
Tell Captain Fox to keep his company and cut him off.

09:09.703 --> 09:36.177
[Music.]

09:36.177 --> 09:41.163
General Houston, I have the report on the enemy's losses and ours.

09:41.183 --> 09:41.764
Yes, Horton?

09:42.225 --> 09:51.036
The enemy suffered 630 kills, 208 wounded, and 730 prisoners, including President General Santa Ana and General Kaz.

09:51.056 --> 09:52.598
And our own losses?

09:52.898 --> 09:55.442
Two kills and 23 wounded, sir.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.643
Six mortally.

09:56.663 --> 09:57.644
Very light losses, sir.

09:58.345 --> 10:03.552
For that, we must give our grateful thanks to that being who rules the destinies of nations.

10:04.628 --> 10:09.947
and has, in the time of our greatest need, enabled us to arrest a powerful invader.

10:09.947 --> 10:39.779
[Music.]

10:39.779 --> 10:43.746
Lucky we got the men all back from the army before the cold weather set in, Jack.

10:43.766 --> 10:44.768
Yes, it is, Mr. Booth.

10:45.149 --> 10:47.994
At least we've been able to get the dam built and the mill ready to go.

10:48.455 --> 10:54.165
If we'd had to wait until spring to build the dam, it'd have been a whole lot more hotter, what with the spring floods and all.

10:54.325 --> 10:57.731
Well, we should get quite a few boards sawed yet this year.

10:57.751 --> 11:02.580
I figure we should be able to cut at least 1,200 board feet a day with this power saw if we try it.

11:03.286 --> 11:08.013
Over around New Orleans, there are mills like this that put out as much as 1,500 feet.

11:08.613 --> 11:11.658
We'll get 1,500 feet a day from this one, too.

11:11.678 --> 11:13.400
Aren't we about ready to turn it loose?

11:13.801 --> 11:16.024
We're just tightening up the bolts before we start cutting.

11:16.464 --> 11:20.149
I told Zeke to check it all over before he saw the first log.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.671
Zeke, how's it coming?

11:21.691 --> 11:22.993
Just about ready, Jack.

11:23.013 --> 11:23.774
I'll be up in a minute.

11:24.395 --> 11:26.458
I'll get the first log in position, Mr. Booth.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.599
Henry, George, let's get ready with the log.

11:29.679 --> 11:30.621
We'll get her up, Jack.

11:30.661 --> 11:31.182
Just a minute.

11:31.542 --> 11:32.885
Careful with that butt in, George.

11:32.925 --> 11:33.987
It's about to roll off.

11:34.367 --> 11:35.009
Steady there.

11:35.449 --> 11:35.830
Steady.

11:36.171 --> 11:36.752
That's better.

11:36.772 --> 11:37.954
It's all right, Jack.

11:37.974 --> 11:40.218
I'll check the machinery all over and ever bolt tight.

11:40.499 --> 11:41.661
All right.

11:41.681 --> 11:41.981
Ready?

11:42.943 --> 11:43.664
Start her going.

11:43.684 --> 11:45.207
Let's see those boards come off.

11:45.207 --> 11:55.741
[Sound effects.]

11:55.741 --> 12:25.113 
[Music.]

12:25.113 --> 12:31.347
You have been listening to the dramatization of Mr. Booth's Sawmill, an episode in early Texas history.

12:31.968 --> 12:43.915
This mill, built in 1836 by Mr. Robert E. Booth at the head of Adams Bayou, six miles southeast of Orange, Texas, was one of the early sawmills of Texas.

12:44.587 --> 12:57.889
From this small beginning has come the present logging and lumbering industry of Texas, which now employs more than 30,000 men and brings $30 million in wages to the state every year.

12:58.710 --> 13:03.037
There are now nearly 700 sawmills in Texas.

13:03.057 --> 13:09.868
On these sawmills depend many other Texas industries, factories which produce boxes and baskets,

13:10.304 --> 13:17.241
Furniture, barrels and kegs, woodenware, tool and broom handles, toys and bobbledies.

13:17.261 --> 13:23.756
A large part of Texas lumber is being used to construct thousands of new homes each year.

13:23.777 --> 13:28.127
A constant supply of timber will build a greater Texas.

13:29.137 --> 13:50.807
[Music.]
