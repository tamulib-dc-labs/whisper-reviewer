00:00.000 --> 00:13.868
[Silence.]

00:13.868 --> 00:40.025 
[Music.]

00:40.025 --> 00:40.726
Thank you, boys.

00:40.806 --> 00:41.628
Thank you a whole lot.

00:41.648 --> 00:42.249
Howdy, friends.

00:42.269 --> 00:42.910
How are y'all?

00:42.930 --> 00:47.016
Yesterday, it's me again, the old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, and the Knotheads.

00:47.457 --> 00:50.942
Sitting here under the big old pine tree, we're going to be with you for another spell.

00:51.003 --> 00:57.373
So drag up a chair there and relax and try to enjoy these tunes we're going to play for you.

00:57.393 --> 00:59.276
We'll do our best to play them our best.

00:59.396 --> 01:06.387
And we've got a few things we wanted to talk over with you and discuss about the woods and forest and hither, thither, and yon.

01:06.890 --> 01:08.296
We're gonna start off with Bob.

01:08.316 --> 01:14.520
Bob Henderson playing his little fiddle, playing an old hoedown tune called the Mississippi Sawyer.

01:14.520 --> 02:11.437
[Music.]

02:11.437 --> 02:12.578
Well, thank you, Bobby.

02:12.678 --> 02:13.319
Thank you, boys.

02:13.740 --> 02:15.842
Let's just dedicate that tune to Mississippi.

02:16.122 --> 02:17.124
Mississippi saw you.

02:17.464 --> 02:22.470
I'm telling you, you find some of the finest people over there in Mississippi just as friendly and nice.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.572
You know, that reminds me, friends.

02:25.093 --> 02:28.577
American people are the friendliest people in the world.

02:28.597 --> 02:29.918
We all brag about that.

02:29.938 --> 02:30.399
We know it.

02:30.860 --> 02:33.883
They're usually just downright neighborly.

02:34.184 --> 02:43.114
A fellow's car, if he can't get it started in the morning, a cold morning and all, well, the neighbor, he don't mind a bit in the world getting his out and going up there in the cold.

02:43.614 --> 02:46.978
Give him a hand, push him, pull him, and help him get started.

02:47.618 --> 02:50.962
Pull him out if he happens to get in the ditch, bogged down or something.

02:50.982 --> 02:54.806
He'll walk two miles to help him get out of the ditch.

02:55.747 --> 03:01.153
If a man's house catches on fire, well, everybody run, break his neck, getting up there to help him.

03:01.522 --> 03:04.365
Get his stuff out and try to put the fire out.

03:04.385 --> 03:16.697
What I can't understand is, though, I just can't understand why the same concern that we got for people and their property don't always apply to their forest lands, woods lands, too.

03:17.618 --> 03:20.020
But, you know, it don't for some reason or other.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.022
Had you ever thought about that?

03:22.042 --> 03:30.330
Now, I know, friends, that the American people are very neighborly, and they're always ready to help their neighbors.

03:31.728 --> 03:35.693
I went to see a fellow one time about a fire, a little fire.

03:35.713 --> 03:37.976
He owned a small farm.

03:37.996 --> 03:45.486
And his farm was right in the big middle of some mighty fine woods, an awful big woods, thousands of acres.

03:45.506 --> 03:48.991
And he was sitting right in the middle of it and had a fire got out over there.

03:49.772 --> 03:56.321
And I just felt like in my own mind that this particular man was the cause of it.

03:56.341 --> 03:57.722
Of course, he wouldn't admit to it.

03:57.762 --> 04:00.486
When I went over and talked to him, you know, he wouldn't say that he did.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.090
He wouldn't say he did at all.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.295
Of course, I guess that's quite natural, you know.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.918
But I asked him, well, I talked to him a long time.

04:09.938 --> 04:14.403
In fact, I wound up eating dinner with him there, had dinner with him, and talked to him a long time.

04:15.545 --> 04:25.456
And I asked him in the conversation, I asked him one time, I said, suppose somebody come along and pull such a job on your land, set your place on fire.

04:26.598 --> 04:30.422
And he got kind of mad about it, and he said, well, I'll tell you.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.521
Said, I'd feel him full of birdshot.

04:33.823 --> 04:34.724
Now, that's funny, ain't it?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.567
It's funny, but it ain't so funny.

04:37.588 --> 04:40.451
Because we're all in this forest fire business.

04:41.352 --> 04:45.638
And when the woods or the forest burn, we all suffer one way or the other.

04:46.459 --> 04:48.321
Timber is money.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.784
It's money any way you figure it.

04:50.805 --> 04:58.975
You've got to have the timber to have houses, kitchen shelves, floors to walk on, walls, roofs over your head, pencils for the kids at school,

04:59.292 --> 05:07.519
paper for them to write on, for them to get an education, and just thousands and thousands of other things I could stand up here and mention to your friends.

05:07.539 --> 05:08.720
Well, you already know that.

05:09.241 --> 05:10.181
We need this timber.

05:10.221 --> 05:12.483
We've got to protect it.

05:12.503 --> 05:21.771
And the only way we can protect it is for you and me and everybody to pitch in and everybody help one another just like you would if your neighbor's house was burning down.

05:22.192 --> 05:24.254
Do the same way about these woods fires.

05:24.774 --> 05:28.337
Because, friends, it don't matter whose timber burns, we lose.

05:28.705 --> 05:30.348
Now, here's the next tune here.

05:30.368 --> 05:35.118
I think this is an appropriate tune for this particular program here.

05:35.138 --> 05:41.470
In fact, we're going to get ready to come up here and do the Shotgun Boogie.

05:41.490 --> 05:48.604
There it stands in the corner with the barrel so straight I looked out the window and over the gate.

05:50.170 --> 05:52.754
The big fat rabbits are jumping in the grass.

05:52.974 --> 05:55.578
Wait till they hear my old shotgun blast.

05:55.598 --> 06:00.726
Shotgun boogie, I done saw your track.

06:00.746 --> 06:05.813
Look out, Mr. Rabbit, when I cock my hammer back.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.497
Well over on the ridge is a scaly bark.

06:08.697 --> 06:11.161
Hickering up so big, you can see them in the dark.

06:11.361 --> 06:13.785
The big fat squirrel, they scratch and they fight.

06:13.805 --> 06:17.410
I'll be on that ridge before daylight with the shotgun boogie. All I need is one shot.

06:21.659 --> 06:24.497
Look out and push your tail, tonight you'll be in the barn.

06:24.497 --> 06:42.196
[Music.]

06:42.196 --> 06:44.941
Well, I met a pretty girl, she was tall and thin.

06:45.161 --> 06:47.586
I asked her what you had, she said a Fox 410.

06:47.846 --> 06:50.211
I looked her up and down, said, boy, this is love.

06:50.251 --> 06:53.076
So we headed for the brush to shoot a big fat dove.

06:53.336 --> 06:57.083
Shotgun boogie, boy, the feathers flew.

06:58.425 --> 07:02.112
Look out, Mr. Dove, when she draws her beat on you.

07:03.475 --> 07:06.219
I sat down on the log and took her on my lap.

07:06.239 --> 07:08.923
She said, wait a minute, bud, you got to see my pap.

07:08.943 --> 07:11.767
He's got a 16-gauge choke down like a rifle.

07:11.987 --> 07:14.611
He don't like a man that's gonna trifle.

07:14.831 --> 07:18.777
Shotgun boogie, draws a beat so fine.

07:20.079 --> 07:23.003
Look out, big boy, it's loaded all the time.

07:23.003 --> 07:39.807
[Music.]

07:39.807 --> 07:43.695
Well, I called on her pap like a gentleman order.

07:43.715 --> 07:46.762
He said, no brush hunter's gonna get my daughter.

07:46.802 --> 07:49.227
He cocked back the hammer right on the spot.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.953
When the gun went off, I outrun the shot.

07:52.414 --> 07:53.817
Shotgun boogie.

07:54.739 --> 07:56.262
I wanted wedding bells.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.651
I'll be back, little girl, when your pappy runs out of shells.

08:03.601 --> 08:04.242
Thank you, Ray.

08:04.262 --> 08:04.602
Thank you.

08:04.642 --> 08:08.367
I think that'd be a good idea when he runs out of shells.

08:08.387 --> 08:09.829
Thank you there for that song, buddy.

08:10.370 --> 08:12.893
One time I went out on a small fire.

08:12.953 --> 08:13.794
It wasn't too big.

08:14.555 --> 08:17.999
And we had it pretty well under control.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.382
And an old man come by.

08:21.243 --> 08:24.307
His land was joining the land where this fire was.

08:24.367 --> 08:26.110
And we just about had it under control.

08:26.150 --> 08:27.391
And he stopped.

08:27.411 --> 08:31.937
And he kind of said it in a joking way, talking to me.

08:32.356 --> 08:34.659
But he was sort of serious about it, too.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.485
He told me, he said, Jelly, why don't you boys just let that fire burn?

08:39.246 --> 08:45.755
He said, maybe it'll kill off some of these ticks and snakes and boll weevils and stuff out there and all.

08:46.937 --> 08:51.403
Well, we went on taking care of the fire, and he drove on up to his house.

08:51.543 --> 08:59.034
And a little breeze come up and blew some sparks over across a small branch that was run down through there.

08:59.054 --> 09:01.958
It was right on the land line there.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.996
And blew a spark over on his land.

09:05.557 --> 09:12.868
And he had some beautiful little pine trees out there that he was very proud of and was taking good care of them.

09:12.888 --> 09:13.970
And he looked down there.

09:13.990 --> 09:15.853
It was kind of down the hill from his house.

09:15.873 --> 09:19.238
And he looked down there and seen smoke coming up out of his patch.

09:19.258 --> 09:20.740
And boy, here he come.

09:20.905 --> 09:23.227
You're talking about a man crying and hollering.

09:23.568 --> 09:25.349
Now, he was hollering like a tired coon.

09:25.389 --> 09:27.011
He was wanting us to get that fire out.

09:27.712 --> 09:29.253
Oh, he was suffering.

09:29.273 --> 09:32.897
He was just raising sand, and he was in there himself doing everything he could.

09:33.037 --> 09:42.146
He had a flap and a fire rake, and he was flapping part of the time and scratching with his rake part of the time and trying to get this fire out.

09:42.166 --> 09:47.892
Well, that just goes to show you, friends, I can't quite understand

09:48.378 --> 10:02.193
Now, this old man, an old settler there, had been there all of his life, he still had the attitude and kind of felt like that it was all right as long as this fire was across the line over on the other man's land.

10:02.673 --> 10:07.919
But when it got over on his there running wild, well, he went running wild with it.

10:07.979 --> 10:09.400
He started having spasms.

10:09.681 --> 10:11.002
He wanted us to get it put out.

10:11.222 --> 10:13.265
And, of course, we did.

10:13.285 --> 10:16.528
But, friends, it don't make any difference whose side the

10:16.846 --> 10:18.408
fence the fire zone.

10:18.829 --> 10:24.155
A fire don't have any respect for a landline or a fence or anything like that.

10:24.215 --> 10:26.398
It knows no boundary lines at all.

10:26.418 --> 10:33.287
When it gets started, it burns everybody's land that gets in its way if it's not taken care of and stopped.

10:33.307 --> 10:34.248
And we can stop it.

10:34.909 --> 10:36.030
The people can stop it.

10:36.091 --> 10:38.393
The forestry boys can't do it by themselves.

10:38.974 --> 10:40.837
I know of lots of cases.

10:40.917 --> 10:46.684
I've been right behind cars driving down the highway when there'd be just a small little fire started side the road

10:46.985 --> 10:48.507
And cars just zizzing by.

10:48.567 --> 10:50.429
Nobody paid any attention to it.

10:50.449 --> 10:54.133
Well, I can't help but notice those sort of things, friends, because I'm in this.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.136
And I want you to get in it with me.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.620
It takes all of us, and we can all do the job.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.342
I guarantee you, we can all do the job.

11:02.563 --> 11:05.787
Well, I guess we better play another tune here.

11:05.807 --> 11:07.268
Here's Herman to do the next tune.

11:07.769 --> 11:09.411
It's a steel guitar tune.

11:09.431 --> 11:10.833
Herman does a good job on it.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.975
It's a little thing called Southlands.

11:12.975 --> 12:13.216
[Music.]

12:13.216 --> 12:26.491
Well, all right there, Herman.

12:26.531 --> 12:27.512
Thank you a lot, buddy.

12:27.552 --> 12:29.815
That was mighty nicely done there, Southlands.

12:30.395 --> 12:31.637
Friends, we've run out of time.

12:31.657 --> 12:35.321
We're going to have to go out from under the old pine tree, but we'll be back.

12:35.781 --> 12:37.283
The announcer will let you know when.

12:37.921 --> 12:44.310
But before we go, friends, here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you, and I'd like for you to keep it in mind and turn it over.

12:45.111 --> 12:49.778
When timber burns, I don't care whose or even where it might be.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.682
It just adds up to this one thing.

12:53.303 --> 12:54.966
We're losers, you and me.

12:54.966 --> 13:08.515
[Music.]

13:08.515 --> 13:09.536
Well, friends, that's it.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.359
We've got to go.

13:11.379 --> 13:16.066
We've certainly enjoyed our little visit with you, and we hope that you'll come our way again soon.

13:16.647 --> 13:20.593
Listen to the local announcer, and he'll let you know the exact date and time we'll be back.

13:21.314 --> 13:33.932
Don't forget, friends, that this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:35.920 --> 13:41.661
Remember friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

13:41.661 --> 14:24.000
[Music.]
