00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
[Silence.]

00:08.000 --> 00:25.647
[Music.]

00:25.647 --> 00:26.888
Well, howdy, friends.

00:27.109 --> 00:27.769
How y'all?

00:28.870 --> 00:38.501
This the old friend, Woods Rider, Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads, sitting here on the old pine tree, and we'd like for you to come down the trail.

00:39.181 --> 00:47.670
Just come right on down, make yourself at home, pull up your knot there, pine knot, that is, knot, pine knot, and make yourself at home.

00:47.690 --> 00:50.994
Now, we're going to sing a few of the songs.

00:51.014 --> 00:52.195
We're going to get serious.

00:52.529 --> 00:57.956
Some nonsense and some sense none and... Nonsense, yeah, that's it.

00:57.976 --> 00:59.065
So just pull up a chair there and make yourself at home.

00:59.065 --> 01:08.849
[Music.]

01:08.849 --> 01:08.909
Oh!

01:08.989 --> 01:10.311
Well, all right there, friends.

01:10.331 --> 01:21.625
This next 14 and a half minutes here with the three knotheads and myself, Jelly Elliott, that is, is brought to you the best wishes and compliments from your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's forestry service.

01:21.993 --> 01:30.312
Friends, we got something here that we're going to, you know, this program here just about winds up things and all, you know.

01:30.332 --> 01:33.379
We've been with you here for a long time, and it about winds up things.

01:33.399 --> 01:36.305
Well, I better not get into that now, so I'll sing first.

01:36.325 --> 01:37.147
And here's mine.

01:37.628 --> 01:40.575
There's a Big Rock in the Road.

01:40.575 --> 01:54.933
[Music.]

01:54.933 --> 02:24.754
There's a big rock in the road And it's that block in the road. A lot of careless hopes have found it So you'd better go round it. There's a big rock in the road. There's a hole under the rock. And it's cold under the rock. And they say if you fall in it That your life won't last a minute. There's a big rock in the road.

02:25.240 --> 02:47.485
We'll leave the darkness behind you. Shine your light up ahead. You don't want troubles to find you. Leave the sight that's ahead. There's a big rock in the road. It's that block in the road.

02:47.802 --> 02:54.074
If you're not very humble, then you're liable to stumble on that red big old rock from the road.

02:54.755 --> 02:55.336
Ho!

02:55.336 --> 03:40.435
[Music.]

03:40.435 --> 04:09.868
There's a big rock in the road And it's that block in the road. A lot of callous folks have found it, So you'd better go round it. There's a big rock in the road. There's a hole under the rock And it's cold under the rock. And they say if you fall in it That your life won't last a minute. There's a big rock in the road.

04:10.608 --> 04:14.678
Well, leave the darkness behind you.

04:14.698 --> 04:16.923
Shine your light up ahead.

04:18.266 --> 04:21.655
You don't want trouble to find you.

04:22.096 --> 04:25.123
Just change the life that you've led.

04:25.542 --> 04:29.366
There's a big rock in the road.

04:29.386 --> 04:33.089
And it's a sad block in the road.

04:33.109 --> 04:36.893
If you're not very humble, then you'll liable to stumble

04:36.993 --> 04:42.438
On that great big old rock in the road.

04:42.458 --> 04:43.239
Well, all right.

04:43.279 --> 04:43.899
Thank you, boys.

04:43.919 --> 04:45.481
There's a big rock in the road.

04:47.243 --> 04:51.186
It sure is a big rock in the road.

04:51.206 --> 04:53.068
Friends, you know, I tell you.

04:54.989 --> 04:59.354
This is the last time that we'll be on the air here for, I guess.

05:00.295 --> 05:01.537
Now, understand I'm guessing.

05:03.179 --> 05:07.804
Last time we'll be here under the old pine tree visiting with you for a spell.

05:09.045 --> 05:12.169
And then three Knotheads and myself.

05:12.930 --> 05:14.512
Now, we'll be missing you.

05:14.952 --> 05:16.094
We'll miss you a whole lot.

05:16.594 --> 05:19.057
We got to move along down the trail.

05:19.558 --> 05:20.759
Get on downstream.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.983
You know, the fish, they come upstream and then they go downstream.

05:24.487 --> 05:25.508
Well, that's the way we are.

05:25.588 --> 05:28.312
We come up with the fish and go down with the fish.

05:28.332 --> 05:29.273
We've got to move along.

05:30.674 --> 05:34.659
And this is the last program, I imagine, for some time.

05:34.839 --> 05:35.981
I just don't know.

05:36.121 --> 05:39.024
You can't ever tell what is in the future.

05:39.044 --> 05:42.509
That's why they have fortune tellers to tell what's in the future.

05:42.529 --> 05:45.552
But who knows whether they can tell it or not.

05:45.572 --> 05:53.802
Now, this radio station here that we're playing on now, and the State Forester Service and Uncle Sam's Forester Service,

05:54.777 --> 05:57.862
And the good Lord is willing, we'll be back.

05:59.043 --> 06:00.025
Yes, sir, we'll be back.

06:00.125 --> 06:11.262
If they're all willing and everything can get together and all willing, we'll be back to play a few of these old corny hillbilly tunes for you and telling you a few things, hither, thither, and yon about this, that, and the other.

06:11.803 --> 06:14.246
And the woods, woods, you know, that's the woods.

06:14.287 --> 06:15.328
We love the woods.

06:15.408 --> 06:16.630
Everybody loves the woods.

06:16.650 --> 06:17.311
You love them.

06:17.632 --> 06:21.898
They ain't no used to stand up there with your bare face hanging out and say you don't, of course you do.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.450
Everybody loves the wood.

06:23.630 --> 06:24.792
We've got to take care of them.

06:25.774 --> 06:28.558
If we don't take care of them, won't nobody take care of them.

06:28.579 --> 06:31.163
It's left up to us, and we're going to take care of them.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.224
We're going to do our part.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.507
Are you going to do yours?

06:34.148 --> 06:35.870
Yeah, you're going to do your part.

06:36.812 --> 06:37.633
I knew you would.

06:37.774 --> 06:38.695
I knew you would.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.238
Everybody will.

06:40.258 --> 06:46.047
The good old woods, you go out on the fish bank of fishing, and...

06:46.415 --> 06:49.878
You just love to go out there where everything's green, the flowers.

06:49.919 --> 06:54.944
In the early spring of the year, you go out there and the violence is blooming and the dogwoods is putting out everything.

06:54.964 --> 06:55.764
Ain't that nice?

06:56.365 --> 06:59.228
Oh, that's the finest life in the world.

06:59.268 --> 07:01.290
Just think of the millionaires.

07:01.310 --> 07:02.011
Millionaires.

07:02.151 --> 07:05.654
It's got money that they couldn't spend the principal off of.

07:05.975 --> 07:07.596
I mean, they couldn't spend the interest off of.

07:08.137 --> 07:12.321
They just give half of it to be out there where them dogwoods is blooming.

07:12.554 --> 07:13.875
And the violence is blooming now.

07:14.056 --> 07:15.237
Let's keep it that way, Frank.

07:15.257 --> 07:18.741
The only way to keep it that way is keep the forest fires out.

07:18.761 --> 07:19.762
Fires.

07:19.782 --> 07:20.823
That's what does it.

07:21.004 --> 07:21.825
Fires.

07:21.845 --> 07:25.068
Who wants to go out and sit down in the woods where the fire's been through that?

07:25.429 --> 07:26.910
Burn up all that brush.

07:27.411 --> 07:28.512
The briars.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.675
You go through there and the briars stick you and all that.

07:31.215 --> 07:32.096
That's all right, though.

07:32.497 --> 07:33.298
It's mighty fine.

07:33.338 --> 07:34.819
It's better than having them burnt.

07:35.140 --> 07:35.981
Let's play another song.

07:36.141 --> 07:37.262
Slim's going to sing one.

07:37.732 --> 07:40.256
Slim's going to sing one of his own tunes, friends.

07:40.276 --> 07:44.843
He wrote this tune, and we're going to publish it some of these days, If You'll Only Say You Care.

07:44.843 --> 07:57.523
[Music.]

07:57.523 --> 08:03.132
What have I done to you, my darlin'

08:03.584 --> 08:29.001
To make you treat me so unfair? You still could be my only true love If you will only say you care. You broke my heart and left me crying

08:29.285 --> 08:35.400
But you will pay for doing wrong.

08:35.881 --> 08:42.517
To treat me right, you were not trying.

08:42.537 --> 08:45.143
You told me lies.

08:46.005 --> 08:47.108
I should have known.

08:48.927 --> 08:55.154
My heart for you, my dear, is bleeding.

08:55.754 --> 09:01.941
For you were wrong in leaving me.

09:02.802 --> 09:09.329
My love, someday there you'll be needing.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.992
You'll want me back.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.715
Just wait and see.

09:16.670 --> 09:28.808
You could have had my love forever, the love I give so fair and square.

09:29.770 --> 09:39.184
I pray that you won't have to suffer if you will only

09:39.670 --> 09:44.957
say you care.

09:44.977 --> 09:45.958
Well, thank you, Slim.

09:45.978 --> 09:46.619
Thank you, friends.

09:46.659 --> 09:47.920
That was Slim's own tune.

09:47.961 --> 09:52.807
He wrote that tune all by his little old T-90s himself.

09:53.828 --> 09:55.090
That's a pretty tune, Slim.

09:55.410 --> 09:57.673
I kind of like that, and I know our friends liked it.

09:58.254 --> 10:01.037
Friends, I told you this was our last program here for a while.

10:01.938 --> 10:08.867
And I'd like to remind you again, friends, we offered you this little book, this little book, you know, the book I told you about.

10:09.320 --> 10:15.267
That connects and ties in the Bible with these forest fires.

10:15.628 --> 10:18.171
That's happening all over the country.

10:18.191 --> 10:19.672
All over the country.

10:19.692 --> 10:20.934
It ties it all in there.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.337
A lot of pictures, a lot of scriptures from the Bible.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.539
And I wish you had this little book.

10:25.740 --> 10:30.706
I just wish it was possible so I could come out there and hand each and every one of you one of these little books.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.588
Because I'd like for you to have it.

10:33.349 --> 10:35.491
Now you can get our picture too.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.494
The three knotheads and myself.

10:37.874 --> 10:38.635
That's Jelly Elliott.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.268
and the three knotheads.

10:40.288 --> 10:43.332
You can get the book and the picture free.

10:43.352 --> 10:51.724
All you have to do to get this book and picture of the three knotheads and myself is just sit down right now and write us a penny postcard or a letter.

10:51.744 --> 10:56.050
A penny postcard will do the job saying you want the book and the picture.

10:56.070 --> 11:00.977
Address it to Jelly Elliott and the three knotheads in care of the station that you're now listening to.

11:01.548 --> 11:11.398
Now, friends, all of you out there, this is our 13th week here, and we wind this thing up here, and we got to move along, and I'm sure sorry, and I hope that you are too.

11:12.059 --> 11:27.535
Now, you loggers out there, hunters, fishermen, campers, farmers, schoolteachers, business folks, school kids, everybody, sports and supposed to be sports, young and old, you got to do your part.

11:27.555 --> 11:29.277
You got to shoulder your part of the wheel.

11:29.797 --> 11:31.980
Now, that's what it's got to be.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.001
That's what it's going to take.

11:34.363 --> 11:46.559
If every man, woman, child will just do her his part in preventing these woods fires, boy, we'll sure cut down the size and number.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.101
I mean, that's right.

11:48.942 --> 11:55.631
I told you all about it in the future programs, and I wish I had time to go on and on, but I haven't.

11:55.671 --> 11:56.592
I got to go, friends.

11:57.253 --> 11:58.555
Now, that's what it's got to be.

11:58.703 --> 12:00.909
That's what has got to be done.

12:00.929 --> 12:01.691
And we can do it.

12:02.774 --> 12:03.216
Let's do it.

12:04.018 --> 12:06.204
Friends, we've run out of time here.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.691
No, we've got just a minute or two.

12:08.831 --> 12:10.536
Excuse me, I looked at the clock wrong.

12:10.887 --> 12:14.230
We've got time for a little bit of a musical tune here.

12:14.250 --> 12:18.855
Let's do a little bit of a musical, and we'll get Robert and his fiddle here.

12:19.616 --> 12:21.238
I can't see that clock very well.

12:21.618 --> 12:27.072
I don't know just how much time we've got, but Robert's going to come up here and do just a dab, dab, and a half, two dabs of Ida Red.

12:27.072 --> 12:56.249 
[Music.]

12:56.249 --> 13:00.491
My old maid just promised me when she died she'd set me free.

13:00.511 --> 13:03.916
She lived so long, head got bald, she took notes and I'd die at all.

13:04.377 --> 13:06.139
Ida Red, Ida Red, I'm a plumb fool for Ida Red.

13:06.139 --> 13:28.552
[Music.]

13:28.552 --> 13:34.720
That was a little dab dab and a half two dabs of Ida Red.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.583
I wish we had time to play it all.

13:37.225 --> 13:40.751
I just wish we had time to play it on and on and on and on and on.

13:40.771 --> 13:43.416
We really enjoyed being with you these 13 weeks.

13:43.531 --> 13:50.458
And I hope the Lord and everybody's concerned is willing for us to come back and be with you if we ever in your community come to see us.

13:50.478 --> 13:53.401
Friends, I'd like to leave you with just a little thought for the day.

13:55.122 --> 14:02.089
It's just like the good book says, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.

14:03.010 --> 14:11.058
And don't forget, friends, we've been brought to you for the last 14 and a half minutes by your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's forestry service.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.880
Keep that in mind, friends.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.593
Keep down the forest fires.

14:14.994 --> 14:19.248
Remember, only you can prevent forest fires.

14:19.248 --> 14:30.571
[Music.]
