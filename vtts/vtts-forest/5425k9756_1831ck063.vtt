00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[Silence.]

00:10.000 --> 00:28.482
[Music.]

00:28.482 --> 00:30.865
Bill Scott, Forest Ranger!

00:30.865 --> 00:37.949
[Music.]

00:37.949 --> 00:44.297
Today we present the fourth program in a new series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:44.877 --> 00:47.080
Our scene is Beaver Dam Forest.

00:47.100 --> 00:56.351
The golden light of early morning streams through the trees as three riders make their cautious way toward the open range that marks the forest boundary.

00:56.371 --> 01:01.037
Ranger Bill is astride his spirited young horse Sparks, son of Daisy.

01:01.118 --> 01:07.885
His forestry aides, Joe and Sam, less used to the saddle than the ranger, are riding a pair of wise old ponies.

01:12.150 --> 01:21.099
As the three horses move along slowly, Joe and Sam edge their mounts closer and closer to Ranger Bill, as though fearful of being left behind.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.847
In the distance, crows wing their way above the treetops, and the sound of their call drifts back to the silent riders.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.864
Joe and Sam stir uneasily on their saddles.

01:32.525 --> 01:34.949
They keep eyeing Ranger Bill's rifle in its scabbard.

01:35.811 --> 01:41.120
The ranger, alert to every sound and movement in the forest, stares intently at the ground.

01:41.881 --> 01:43.945
Suddenly, his body stiffens.

01:44.846 --> 01:49.354
With a gentle tug, he stops his horse and springs lightly to the ground.

01:49.374 --> 01:51.157
All right, boys, pile off.

01:52.659 --> 01:54.362
Well, here's what we're looking for.

01:55.186 --> 01:56.889
That carnival lion came this way.

01:57.430 --> 01:58.531
You found a track.

01:58.551 --> 01:59.513
Is that it, Ranger Bill?

01:59.833 --> 02:01.095
Where is the track, Ranger Bill?

02:01.836 --> 02:02.558
I don't see anything.

02:02.738 --> 02:03.179
Here, Sam.

02:03.579 --> 02:04.140
Look here, Joe.

02:04.761 --> 02:06.083
You see the soft spot on the ground?

02:06.704 --> 02:08.227
See the big print?

02:08.247 --> 02:09.248
It's pretty fresh, too.

02:09.889 --> 02:10.410
Golly.

02:11.351 --> 02:12.814
Maybe he's right around here.

02:13.214 --> 02:14.216
Somewhere close by.

02:14.496 --> 02:15.298
Here's another print.

02:16.059 --> 02:18.463
He's headed for the open range again, isn't he, Ranger Bill?

02:18.583 --> 02:20.586
That's what I figured, Sam.

02:20.566 --> 02:24.794
Well, boys, believe it or not, those are the tracks of a lion you're looking at.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.841
Wow, and an African lion at that.

02:28.782 --> 02:33.813
I don't mind telling you I'd rather be up on Hawk Tower right now than trailing a mean old lion.

02:34.754 --> 02:37.039
This happens to be a mean young lion, Joe.

02:37.154 --> 02:38.937
You know something, Ranger Bill?

02:39.197 --> 02:39.838
What's that, Sam?

02:40.299 --> 02:41.941
It just doesn't seem real, all this.

02:42.322 --> 02:47.250
You, Joe, and I out here in fever-damn forests trailing an honest-to-goodness lion.

02:47.891 --> 02:51.096
It doesn't make sense, and yet it is true, isn't it?

02:51.116 --> 02:52.157
I'm afraid it is, Sam.

02:53.459 --> 02:59.448
I've been thinking that I've done a lot of strange things as a forest ranger, but this doesn't seem quite real to me either.

03:00.610 --> 03:01.692
Easy, easy, Sparks.

03:01.712 --> 03:02.453
Take it easy, boy.

03:04.087 --> 03:06.290
Well, boys, we'd better be getting along.

03:06.310 --> 03:07.672
Let's just follow these tracks along.

03:07.692 --> 03:08.654
We can lead the horses.

03:09.615 --> 03:12.179
It's not far to the boundary in the fence line along the open range.

03:12.940 --> 03:14.141
Come on.

03:14.322 --> 03:22.834
All I can say is that any fellow who'd let a wild lion loose ought to be... Well, something ought to be done about him.

03:22.874 --> 03:24.777
Don't be too hasty in passing judgment, Joe.

03:25.698 --> 03:29.023
I happen to know the owner of the carnival that that lion belongs to.

03:29.043 --> 03:29.824
His name is Davis.

03:30.412 --> 03:34.079
And I know that Mr. Davis is concerned as anyone about the animal getting loose.

03:34.700 --> 03:36.223
Because he's a cattle raiser himself.

03:36.483 --> 03:40.130
Just how did the lion escape from that railroad car in town, Ranger?

03:40.751 --> 03:41.973
Somebody was careless, I guess.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.841
You see, Sam, this lion was just brought into the country.

03:45.961 --> 03:47.644
Pretty wild and untrained, I'd say.

03:48.113 --> 03:50.137
And first real chance he got, he broke out.

03:51.759 --> 03:53.843
Well, we're still on his trail.

03:54.584 --> 03:55.546
You see those tracks, boys?

03:55.866 --> 03:56.127
Yeah.

03:56.588 --> 04:01.015
It was a good thing that farmer saw him or we'd never have found his track, I'll bet.

04:01.035 --> 04:03.219
Hey, do you think he's really dangerous, Ranger Bill?

04:03.440 --> 04:04.241
He could be, Sam.

04:05.022 --> 04:08.448
There are about a hundred men looking for him, including Mr. Davis and his crew.

04:09.570 --> 04:13.217
There's no telling what a wild lion will do when he's cornered.

04:13.237 --> 04:13.497
Well...

04:14.084 --> 04:18.148
Here's the fence marking the boundary between the Beaver Dam Forest and the private range on the other side.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.291
Gee, this is the first time I've been here.

04:20.531 --> 04:23.454
What do we do now, Ranger Bell?

04:23.474 --> 04:25.516
No more tracks, eh?

04:25.537 --> 04:30.021
He must have jumped the fence, and that means he's taken to the open range.

04:30.041 --> 04:31.863
That's not so good, but come on, boys.

04:32.504 --> 04:34.106
We'll work down along the fence line.

04:34.126 --> 04:36.088
There's a gate about a quarter of a mile south of here.

04:37.009 --> 04:37.890
In the saddle with you, boys.

04:39.392 --> 04:40.533
Easy does it, Sparks.

04:40.553 --> 04:41.354
Take it easy, horse.

04:42.435 --> 04:43.416
You boys all right?

04:43.565 --> 04:45.768
Okay, Ranger Bill.

04:45.808 --> 04:47.590
Keep your eyes and ears open, boys.

04:47.610 --> 04:49.472
No telling what we may find from here on out.

04:49.993 --> 04:53.076
Gee, who owns that rangeland across the fence, Ranger Bill?

04:53.497 --> 04:54.918
A fellow by the name of Tom Glover.

04:55.659 --> 04:59.003
Me and his wife, Betty, have just taken over this land and the old house that goes with it.

05:00.225 --> 05:02.407
They're a nice young couple just starting out.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.408
Gee, that's Tom.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.170
What do you mean by that, Sam?

05:05.190 --> 05:08.494
I think that's mighty poor grassland I try to make a living on, that's all.

05:08.674 --> 05:09.756
Ah, you're learning, Sam.

05:10.637 --> 05:13.420
Yes, Tom Glover's going to have quite a job building up this range.

05:14.328 --> 05:15.750
Had a lot of abuse through the years.

05:16.130 --> 05:18.013
Oh, it's been overgrazed, is that it?

05:18.133 --> 05:18.614
Yes, Joe.

05:19.555 --> 05:21.277
Too many cattle have been put on this grass.

05:21.718 --> 05:25.543
In addition, they've been allowed to graze too early in the spring and too late in the fall.

05:26.404 --> 05:30.390
The grass is another natural seed, just haven't had a chance to restore themselves.

05:30.410 --> 05:34.635
Well, then that means someone's got to plant new grass and restore this range artificially.

05:34.655 --> 05:35.617
Oh, that's right, Sam.

05:35.637 --> 05:37.639
Oh, is Tom Glover going to do that, Ranger Bill?

05:38.220 --> 05:42.546
Well, I'm afraid Tom is making the same mistake others have made.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.585
I think he's carrying too many cattle here.

05:45.605 --> 05:48.911
I've talked a bit with him, but... Easy, Barks.

05:48.931 --> 05:49.552
Easy, easy.

05:50.093 --> 05:50.634
Hold it, boys.

05:51.215 --> 05:54.602
Listen.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.385
Oh, that's just an old cow mooing.

05:56.645 --> 05:58.108
Sure, but she's in trouble of some kind.

05:58.268 --> 06:00.953
Hey, you don't think that line could have... I'm going to find out.

06:00.973 --> 06:02.236
Let's head for the gate, boys.

06:02.256 --> 06:03.458
Keep up with Barks if you can.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.061
All right, boys, come on.

06:05.201 --> 06:06.103
Come on, get up, get up.

06:22.283 --> 06:23.724
There's Ranger Bill, Sam.

06:24.004 --> 06:24.945
Just up ahead there.

06:25.286 --> 06:26.487
And there's the cow.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.409
Look, Ranger Bill's kneeling down by something on the ground.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.511
See, it's a calf.

06:31.551 --> 06:32.752
Whoa there, boy.

06:32.772 --> 06:34.774
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:34.794 --> 06:35.294
Hi, boys.

06:36.255 --> 06:37.696
Golly.

06:37.716 --> 06:40.239
Oh, the lion got the calf.

06:40.259 --> 06:42.100
See, is it dead, Ranger Bill?

06:42.120 --> 06:43.181
I'm afraid so, Sam.

06:43.602 --> 06:44.843
Oh, gosh.

06:44.863 --> 06:45.884
I don't like the looks of this.

06:46.844 --> 06:48.806
Seems to me that lion is killing in his blood.

06:49.987 --> 06:52.189
Pretty obvious he didn't want this calf of food.

06:52.658 --> 06:53.900
I wonder... What, Ranger Bill?

06:54.500 --> 06:58.806
Well, I was wondering if this was his first kill, and I just hope that... Someone's riding this way, Ranger Bill.

06:59.026 --> 06:59.807
Oh, I see him, Joe.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.389
Looks like Tom Glover.

07:01.569 --> 07:05.214
Gee, I feel sorry for him just starting out and all of this now.

07:05.334 --> 07:06.876
Golly, look at him come.

07:09.079 --> 07:09.760
Hello, Tom.

07:10.701 --> 07:12.263
Another one, huh?

07:12.283 --> 07:13.004
I'm sorry, Tom.

07:13.425 --> 07:15.668
This makes the third cap he's brought down, Ranger.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.670
It's enough to get a man down.

07:17.991 --> 07:18.271
I know.

07:18.291 --> 07:19.813
I know, Tom.

07:20.738 --> 07:25.355
Tom, I'd like you to meet my two young assistants, Joe McGuire and Sam Freeman.

07:25.556 --> 07:26.399
Hi, Mr. Lunder.

07:26.419 --> 07:27.082
Howdy, boys.

07:28.166 --> 07:29.873
Doggone the luck anyhow.

07:29.993 --> 07:30.776
Don't worry, Tom.

07:30.796 --> 07:32.402
We'll get that lion before too long.

07:32.787 --> 07:34.630
A lot of folks are out after them, you know.

07:34.650 --> 07:39.316
Yeah, but in the meantime, I could be getting in some good licks at reseeding this section of my range.

07:39.336 --> 07:39.637
I know.

07:39.657 --> 07:42.320
Instead of chasing a wild critter all over the country.

07:42.541 --> 07:44.023
Oh, that's too bad, Mr. Glover.

07:44.704 --> 07:47.087
You know, we were talking about that before.

07:47.107 --> 07:49.571
About the need to bring back good grass on this range.

07:49.731 --> 07:50.752
That's what I aim to do.

07:51.033 --> 07:52.635
Fine, Tom, but what about your sparks?

07:53.442 --> 07:57.888
I guess you're planning to get rid of some of your cattle, aren't you, until this part of your range is ready again?

07:58.148 --> 08:01.292
No, I just thought I'd bunch them all up there at the north end.

08:01.312 --> 08:03.555
Well, the grass is pretty good yet.

08:03.575 --> 08:06.078
I just can't afford to sell any of my stock ranges.

08:06.178 --> 08:08.721
Well, Tom, I don't see how you can afford not to.

08:09.262 --> 08:13.086
Excuse me, Ranger Bill, but don't you think we ought to get back on the trail of the lion?

08:13.307 --> 08:14.348
Oh, of course, Sam.

08:14.829 --> 08:16.851
Tom, this is your land, and we're at your service.

08:17.776 --> 08:19.358
What would you like us to do now?

08:19.378 --> 08:20.299
Just a minute, Ranger.

08:20.839 --> 08:23.883
What did you mean I can't afford to keep all my stock?

08:23.903 --> 08:27.707
Well, suppose we hit the saddle, Tom, and we can see what we're talking about as we move along.

08:28.368 --> 08:29.629
That lion can't be far off.

08:29.909 --> 08:30.550
Okay, Ranger.

08:30.590 --> 08:46.568
Now, Tom, to get back to what we were talking about, your plan to improve this part of your range is fine, but the rest of it, well, I just don't think it's so good.

08:47.257 --> 08:49.859
You've got too many cattle, Tom, that's all.

08:49.879 --> 08:52.442
They haven't been able to get enough feed on all of your land.

08:52.482 --> 08:56.966
Now you propose to concentrate the same number of stock on just part of your range.

08:56.986 --> 08:58.607
Well, Tom, don't you see what's going to happen?

08:59.328 --> 09:01.950
Hmm, yeah, I see what you're driving at.

09:01.970 --> 09:07.475
You'll be ruining the only good section of land you've got left because there won't be enough food to go around.

09:07.495 --> 09:09.437
The cattle will still be hungry and underfed.

09:10.437 --> 09:14.341
Sure, you'll be restoring this part, but you'll lose out in the long run.

09:14.801 --> 09:16.723
I never thought about it that way.

09:17.210 --> 09:20.536
But look, man, who'd buy the cattle I was willing to sell?

09:20.556 --> 09:22.380
You know yourself, they're pretty scrawny.

09:22.580 --> 09:23.021
Yes.

09:24.284 --> 09:25.867
Hey, those were gunshots.

09:25.887 --> 09:27.450
The shooting is off there to the north.

09:27.610 --> 09:28.953
Holy smoke.

09:28.973 --> 09:31.878
My wife Betty is up at the north end of the range where most of our cattle are.

09:32.119 --> 09:32.279
Oh, God.

09:32.299 --> 09:33.522
I left her there standing guard.

09:33.622 --> 09:34.884
Oh, Mrs. Glover may be in trouble.

09:35.405 --> 09:36.067
All right, Sparks.

09:36.287 --> 09:36.908
Get up, Sparks.

09:36.928 --> 09:37.269
Come on.

09:37.289 --> 09:38.070
Come on.

09:38.090 --> 09:38.231
Get up.

09:38.251 --> 09:38.391
Get up.

09:53.947 --> 09:55.689
Do you see my wife anywhere, Ranger?

09:56.030 --> 09:57.331
Way over there to the left, Tom.

09:57.692 --> 09:58.353
Near that thicket.

09:59.995 --> 10:01.437
The liar must be in a thicket.

10:01.457 --> 10:02.278
Be careful, Betty.

10:02.298 --> 10:03.059
We're coming.

10:03.099 --> 10:04.500
She's raising the gun to her shoulder.

10:05.141 --> 10:05.902
She's going to shoot.

10:07.725 --> 10:08.265
Easy, Sparks.

10:08.826 --> 10:10.027
Easy, easy, boy.

10:10.047 --> 10:10.869
Hold it now.

10:11.289 --> 10:12.190
Are you all right, Betty?

10:12.210 --> 10:13.932
I got him, Tom.

10:14.273 --> 10:15.174
I got him.

10:15.194 --> 10:16.496
Nice going, Mrs. Glover.

10:17.998 --> 10:19.540
Are you sure you're all right, Betty?

10:21.122 --> 10:22.283
I think so, Tom.

10:22.870 --> 10:24.132
Oh, but I'm glad you're here.

10:25.013 --> 10:27.416
Yeah, that big hat's done for.

10:28.678 --> 10:30.481
Took a lot of courage, Mrs. Glover.

10:30.501 --> 10:31.082
Yes, sir.

10:31.522 --> 10:33.205
Bet he's got plenty of that all right.

10:34.046 --> 10:36.790
He was headed straight for me, and I just had to shoot him.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.893
Well, I don't think he could have taken him alive, Mrs. Glover.

10:40.135 --> 10:44.100
Oh, boys, you caught up with us.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.442
Gee, who shot him, Ranger Bill?

10:45.622 --> 10:46.604
This lady here, Joe.

10:47.185 --> 10:47.886
Meet Mrs. Glover.

10:48.166 --> 10:49.748
Oh, I'm proud to meet you, ma'am.

10:50.429 --> 10:52.472
Golly, he was a big fellow, wasn't he?

10:52.705 --> 10:53.866
This is Sam, Mrs. Glover.

10:54.267 --> 10:55.328
These boys work with me.

10:55.508 --> 10:56.209
Hello, boys.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.491
How do you do, Mrs. Glover?

10:57.651 --> 11:00.194
Well, Tom, that's the end of the killer.

11:01.075 --> 11:06.722
You can get back to your regular work now, and we'll be getting back to ours after I've sent word around that the chase is over.

11:08.184 --> 11:13.710
Joe here should be up on Hawk Tower right now looking out for forest fires instead of hunting lions with us.

11:14.251 --> 11:15.573
Wait just a minute, Ranger.

11:15.993 --> 11:17.195
We got the lions, sure.

11:17.215 --> 11:20.158
But I'm really no better off than I was before.

11:20.198 --> 11:20.839
How do you mean?

11:21.123 --> 11:27.891
I've still got a tough problem facing me, and, well, I'd appreciate it if you could help me out on the answers.

11:28.311 --> 11:30.274
Well, it's not as tough as it seems, Tom.

11:31.275 --> 11:34.739
Well, now, look, you were wondering about selling some of your cattle, weren't you?

11:35.600 --> 11:37.242
And you've agreed that's the thing to do?

11:37.542 --> 11:38.644
How can you, Tom?

11:38.724 --> 11:39.465
Who'd buy them?

11:39.865 --> 11:42.328
I'm looking to the ranger for that answer, Betty.

11:42.348 --> 11:47.234
Tom, do you remember the old saying, it's an ill wind that blows no good?

11:47.694 --> 11:48.115
Sure.

11:48.195 --> 11:48.295
Sure.

11:48.578 --> 11:50.761
But I can't see what that's got to do with myself.

11:50.781 --> 11:56.109
Well, look, Tom, this whole business with its wild lion does have a happy side to it, I'm glad to say.

11:57.370 --> 11:59.093
Now, I know Mr. Davis pretty well.

11:59.113 --> 12:01.456
He's the owner of the carnival that the lion belonged to.

12:01.496 --> 12:02.217
That's right, Sam.

12:02.978 --> 12:04.481
And he's also a cattle buyer.

12:04.961 --> 12:08.907
Now, he owns some fine feedlots where brained cattle are fattened up for market.

12:09.287 --> 12:11.350
Say, that's mighty interesting.

12:11.811 --> 12:16.037
But still, look, Tom, I talked with Mr. Davis last night when the lion got away.

12:16.388 --> 12:20.292
Now, he told me he'd make it up to anyone who suffered any damage because of the lions.

12:20.312 --> 12:21.213
Oh, that's swell.

12:21.534 --> 12:22.855
He'll pay for the calves, then.

12:23.035 --> 12:25.698
And he also told me he was looking for stocks to buy.

12:26.619 --> 12:29.822
Now, I'm sure he'll take yours, Tom, and at a good price, too.

12:29.842 --> 12:30.944
In fact, I'll call him right away.

12:31.504 --> 12:33.647
Gosh, I don't know what to say, Ranger.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.468
Now, there's no need to say anything, Tom.

12:36.349 --> 12:37.991
You'll be all right, you and Mrs. Glover.

12:39.393 --> 12:43.217
You're on your way to building up your grassland, and your herd as well.

12:43.237 --> 12:46.260
And you'll find that even with fewer cattle, you'll be getting better beef

12:46.915 --> 12:49.077
better calves, and better money.

12:49.898 --> 12:52.360
Because you'll be restoring and maintaining your grasslands.

12:54.401 --> 12:55.903
Well, let's go, boys.

12:56.423 --> 12:57.044
Easy, Sparks.

12:57.284 --> 12:58.365
Take it easy, boys.

12:59.406 --> 12:59.606
All right.

12:59.626 --> 13:00.647
Goodbye, Mrs. Glover.

13:01.507 --> 13:03.309
Go long, Tom.

13:03.329 --> 13:04.530
Goodbye, Ranger.

13:04.590 --> 13:05.391
Goodbye, boys.

13:05.811 --> 13:06.812
Thanks for everything.

13:07.553 --> 13:08.273
Oh, gee.

13:08.614 --> 13:09.534
Look at them back there.

13:09.995 --> 13:12.337
Mr. Glover's got his arm around his wife.

13:12.357 --> 13:13.738
They're a fine couple, all right.

13:14.559 --> 13:16.180
And like many Americans before them,

13:16.885 --> 13:18.628
They're making their home on the ring.

13:19.149 --> 13:21.192
Oh, boy, that's my cue, Ranger Bill.

13:21.553 --> 13:25.058
Come on, Harmonica, do your stuff.

13:25.078 --> 13:41.425
And so Ranger Bill's experience once again has brought new hope to those who depend upon nature's bounty for their happiness and livelihoods.

13:42.518 --> 13:49.394
You've just heard the fourth in a new series of programs on forest conservation with Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

13:49.414 --> 13:54.425
Next week, we're in for another exciting adventure when one of the worst enemies of the forest strikes home.

13:54.846 --> 14:00.038
We'll be joining Ranger Bill and his young assistants again in a story called Wings Over the Forest.

14:00.524 --> 14:06.521
Bill Scott Forest Ranger comes to you with a cooperation of the Forest Service, the United States Department of Agriculture.

14:06.882 --> 14:12.037
Bill Scott is written by Bill Bergoffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokant.

14:12.378 --> 14:14.263
Your narrator has been Whit Vernon.

14:14.263 --> 15:16.259
[Music.]

15:16.259 --> 15:57.000
[Silence.]
