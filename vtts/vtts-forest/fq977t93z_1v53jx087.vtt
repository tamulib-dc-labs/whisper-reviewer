WEBVTT

00:16.957 --> 00:25.290
Hell, hell, hell, sure.

00:25.310 --> 00:27.794
Well, howdy, friends and neighbors.

00:27.814 --> 00:31.239
It's your old friend Kelly Elliott, the three knothead.

00:31.259 --> 00:33.863
Yeah, we're just sitting here under the old big pine tree.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.407
Got our fiddles and guitars.

00:36.427 --> 00:37.970
Yeah, we're going to play you a few tunes.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.677
Got a few words here I want to say to you about the woods.

00:43.568 --> 00:43.969
Woods.

00:43.989 --> 00:45.030
You know what that is.

00:45.050 --> 00:45.410
Woods.

00:45.430 --> 00:46.111
Sure, Woods.

00:46.131 --> 00:47.253
That's where we come from.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.014
Woods, you know.

00:49.375 --> 00:49.756
Yes, sir.

00:49.776 --> 00:51.118
That's what we're going to talk to you about.

00:53.080 --> 00:53.881
Well, all right.

00:53.901 --> 00:54.522
Thank you, boys.

00:54.542 --> 00:54.923
Thank you.

00:55.483 --> 00:56.184
Yep, yep.

00:56.224 --> 01:00.610
We gathered around here just like we had good sense, and we're going to play a few tunes for you.

01:00.630 --> 01:02.512
Friends, we'd like to hear from you.

01:02.532 --> 01:04.615
We'd like to have a few chords and letters.

01:05.017 --> 01:12.011
We come to you just ever so often right here on this same station, right here, same place.

01:12.171 --> 01:19.966
If you'll just listen to the announcer here, he'll let you know just exactly what day we'll be back in case you like it and would like to have some more of it.

01:20.026 --> 01:21.068
We'd like to have you listen.

01:21.723 --> 01:22.985
It's brought to you, friends.

01:23.065 --> 01:29.073
It's made possible for the boys and myself sitting here under the pine tree to fiddle for you.

01:29.153 --> 01:37.864
I mean, pick and sing for you by the State Forestry Service and also Uncle Sam's Forestry Service.

01:38.225 --> 01:40.568
Slim's going to start things off, friends.

01:40.828 --> 01:46.716
Slim, he does all the tear-jerking tunes and all that sort of stuff, and he's going to sing one here this time.

01:47.137 --> 01:49.620
It's a little diddy called Tennessee Saturday Night.

01:55.945 --> 01:59.911
Now listen while I tell you about a place I know.

01:59.971 --> 02:03.616
Way down in Tennessee where the tall corn grow.

02:03.937 --> 02:07.242
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pine.

02:07.262 --> 02:09.926
The moon's a little bashful and it's sunshine.

02:11.007 --> 02:14.312
Civilized people live there all right.

02:14.552 --> 02:18.038
They all go native on a Saturday night.

02:18.278 --> 02:22.364
The music is a fiddle and a jack guitar.

02:22.404 --> 02:25.108
They get the kicks from an old fruit jar.

02:25.983 --> 02:29.590
They do the boogie to an old square dance.

02:29.610 --> 02:32.736
So what's this little couple looking for you, man?

02:33.016 --> 02:36.583
Somebody takes a brogan, knocks out the light.

02:36.843 --> 02:40.230
They all go native on a Saturday night.

02:42.233 --> 02:42.574
Well, sure, yeah.

03:14.971 --> 03:28.633
Well, when they really get together, there's a lot of fun.

03:28.673 --> 03:32.579
Cause they don't know the other teller acts of gun.

03:32.699 --> 03:35.123
Everybody does his best to act as well.

03:35.761 --> 03:39.587
There's gonna be a funeral if they start to fight.

03:39.807 --> 03:43.332
They struggle and they shuffle to raw daylight.

03:43.632 --> 03:47.097
They all go native on a Saturday night.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.923
Well, now you've heard my story about this place I know.

03:51.223 --> 03:54.989
Way down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows.

03:55.189 --> 03:57.853
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pots.

03:57.833 --> 04:06.061
Well, all right.

04:06.081 --> 04:15.470
Excuse me.

04:15.550 --> 04:18.633
Oh, Lord.

04:18.653 --> 04:21.295
Yeah, my swallow-naught's trying to take part in the program here.

04:21.796 --> 04:25.299
You know, friends, I'll just tell you right now.

04:25.319 --> 04:27.081
I'll just, uh,

04:27.500 --> 04:34.408
Well, you know, me and the boys here, me and the three knotheads, we live out on Eight and Plum.

04:34.929 --> 04:35.529
Eight and Plum.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.692
Most everybody knows where Eight and Plum is.

04:37.732 --> 04:40.756
That's eight miles out Plum in the country.

04:40.776 --> 04:46.122
Yeah, we live out there, and we roam around in the woods all the time.

04:46.182 --> 04:51.148
Yeah, we're out fishing and hunting and roaming around the woods all the time.

04:51.168 --> 04:51.629
Robert.

04:51.849 --> 04:53.831
Robert and his strata potato fiddle.

04:54.352 --> 04:57.135
Robert, a lot of fiddle players, plays the violin.

04:57.402 --> 04:59.264
and all that sort of stuff, but Robert don't.

04:59.284 --> 05:01.347
He plays a fiddle, playing violin.

05:01.387 --> 05:19.950
Cabbage down.

05:28.115 --> 05:36.208
Throw that horse here!

05:36.629 --> 05:49.650
Throw that horse here!

05:57.207 --> 06:03.095
Well, yeah, there it is, friends, bottle them cabbage on.

06:03.135 --> 06:04.217
Everybody likes cabbage.

06:04.237 --> 06:08.363
The reason I like cabbage so well is I can taste them three days after I eat them.

06:08.383 --> 06:09.304
Hell, they might be fine.

06:09.444 --> 06:13.550
You know, I wanted to talk to you fellas that work out in the woods.

06:13.570 --> 06:19.017
I was out there the other day where they was cutting paperwood, pulpwood, some people call it, paperwood.

06:19.138 --> 06:23.704
That's the wood they make paper out of to write on and print newspapers and

06:24.275 --> 06:28.339
and all that sort of stuff, bags and things.

06:28.919 --> 06:31.822
Paper, you know, paper wood, that's what it is.

06:31.862 --> 06:36.126
Well, I was out there the other day, and it was kind of chilly that morning.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.908
It was kind of chilly.

06:37.968 --> 06:51.480
I was going squirrel hunting, and it was kind of chilly, and them fellas built a fire right there where they was working, right close by, and the wood was thick there, and a lot of dead brush, and

06:52.051 --> 06:58.557
leaves and grass and stuff, and they built them a fire to warm, to warm while they was waiting for the truck to come by and pick them up.

06:59.358 --> 07:12.129
And when the truck come by to pick them up, he stopped, blowed the horn, and they all jumped up and run off and left the fire, just left it there, went on down the road two or three miles to where they was cutting, cutting wood.

07:13.010 --> 07:20.877
Now, they never did stop to think that they run off and left that fire burning there, and they work out there in the woods, make a living, cutting wood.

07:21.312 --> 07:29.701
That's how they feed their families and buy their little children school clothes and books and pencils and things and educate them.

07:30.622 --> 07:35.747
That's how they live and support their family and all.

07:35.768 --> 07:37.449
And they run off and left that far.

07:38.190 --> 07:44.637
That far could have very easily got scattered out through the woods there and burn up all the timber, shut down their job,

07:45.325 --> 07:51.411
And then their children come on and growed up, and there wouldn't have been no timber there because it had all been burned up.

07:51.431 --> 07:53.173
That fire would burn up all the young timber.

07:54.254 --> 07:57.136
Now wasn't that a very silly thing to do?

07:57.156 --> 07:58.157
That was plumb silly.

07:58.257 --> 08:05.024
Now they were supposed to have been grown men and had reasonable sense, and they run off and left that fire burning.

08:05.044 --> 08:06.766
That was the silliest thing I ever seen.

08:06.786 --> 08:14.573
When it wouldn't have took but a minute to put it out, raked all the leaves back from around it, they could have just took their foot and scraped all the leaves back away from that fire.

08:14.873 --> 08:17.676
It couldn't have got out and burned up all the timber.

08:17.696 --> 08:25.844
Why, there's no telling how much timberland that very little fire that they built there to warm their hands would have burned up and burned off.

08:25.864 --> 08:29.628
Now, there's not but one way to stop that, friends, and that's you and me.

08:30.329 --> 08:32.371
We just have to watch that sort of thing.

08:32.391 --> 08:39.398
Now, if you see a fellow jump up and run off and leave his fire like them fellows did the other morning, they was waiting for that truck to come by and pick him up.

08:39.418 --> 08:42.842
It don't cost you nothing to take a minute's time and go over and put out the fire.

08:42.902 --> 08:44.003
Don't just say, well,

08:44.152 --> 08:45.494
Heck, that ain't my worry.

08:45.514 --> 08:46.715
They went off and left it there.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.677
I ain't going to put it out.

08:47.737 --> 08:48.458
I didn't build it.

08:48.959 --> 08:49.259
No.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.943
That's just cutting off your nose to spite your face.

08:52.003 --> 08:56.208
Don't be so jealous or nitwit there.

08:56.228 --> 08:57.069
Go over and put it out.

08:57.089 --> 08:58.091
Don't take but a minute.

08:58.131 --> 09:00.774
Maybe they forgot, which they shouldn't have done.

09:00.815 --> 09:04.479
Understand I'm not trying to hold them up, but it takes us all.

09:04.820 --> 09:07.243
It takes us all, not just one or two, but all of us.

09:07.263 --> 09:10.988
And we all got to pull together to stop these forest fires, and we got to stop them.

09:11.008 --> 09:11.849
We're going to stop them.

09:12.170 --> 09:13.011
They got to be stopped.

09:14.206 --> 09:16.108
Let's play another thing.

09:16.128 --> 09:19.693
I'm telling you, I'm getting plum petered out here.

09:20.013 --> 09:22.576
I think I got the sick ailment don't or something here.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.179
I want to go back to the woods.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.982
I'm tired of fooling around here.

09:27.062 --> 09:28.143
I'm plum give out.

09:28.243 --> 09:30.146
I'm telling you the truth.

09:30.746 --> 09:34.291
Here where they built this town, friends, we come to town today.

09:34.311 --> 09:40.298
We come to town today, and here where they built this town, it's a doggone good thing they built a town here.

09:40.801 --> 09:42.523
Because they'd have never plowed this ground.

09:42.723 --> 09:45.225
That's the hardest ground I ever walked on up and down.

09:45.685 --> 09:46.586
What are we going to sing?

09:46.746 --> 09:47.908
Oh, I'm going to sing, ain't I?

09:48.308 --> 09:49.629
Oh, yeah, friends.

09:49.649 --> 09:50.390
I'm going to sing.

09:51.110 --> 09:51.711
I'm going to sing.

09:51.751 --> 09:55.334
We didn't run over this tune, but we're fixing to run over it now.

09:55.474 --> 09:57.236
It's going to get butchered up.

09:57.256 --> 09:58.537
Robert's going to take it off.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.418
It's a pretty tune.

09:59.438 --> 10:02.081
To all you little girls out there, and I've got two of them.

10:02.441 --> 10:03.121
God bless them.

10:03.682 --> 10:07.025
And they done sweet little things.

10:07.145 --> 10:09.067
To all you little girls out there, here it is.

10:09.087 --> 10:10.268
And it's baby girl.

10:18.466 --> 10:48.102
Your two bright eyes, they shine like diamonds I long to see your hair in curls I'd give the world to hold you darling And to call you baby girl

10:49.820 --> 10:55.729
I have the picture, dear, you gave me.

10:57.471 --> 11:03.420
My Bible holds you a little curl.

11:05.303 --> 11:11.592
In dreams it seems again I hold you.

11:13.107 --> 11:18.552
As I call you baby girl.

11:19.014 --> 11:19.978
Well, Mr. Anderson.

12:21.940 --> 12:50.935
You soon will grow to be a lady And go out in this great wide world No matter, darling, when I meet you I'll still call you baby girl

12:52.552 --> 13:21.107
You say you long to see your daddy I know you'll never prove untrue The years seem oh so long, my darling Since I've been away from you

13:23.821 --> 13:24.782
Well, thank you, boys.

13:24.802 --> 13:25.143
Thank you.

13:25.163 --> 13:30.951
I hope all you little girls out there listening enjoyed that tune as much as I enjoyed singing it for you.

13:30.971 --> 13:32.894
Now, we'd like to have you tune us in again.

13:33.274 --> 13:35.778
We'll be back on this same station again.

13:35.818 --> 13:41.005
You can listen to your announcer, and he'll let you know just exactly what day we'll be back.

13:41.025 --> 13:42.227
And we'd like to have you listen.

13:42.267 --> 13:49.918
Now, again, you log haulers out there, and you pup woodcutters, and you fellas that's hewing cross ties and all that sort of stuff, I've done it all, yes, sir.

13:49.938 --> 13:52.782
The first job I ever had in my life was hewing cross ties, and

13:52.981 --> 14:00.972
July and August, right out in a briar patch, and it was so hot, I could see little scorpions and things jumping around in there.

14:01.232 --> 14:03.636
You want to be careful with them fires.

14:03.776 --> 14:07.441
Don't just stand up there like a nitwit and burn up your own job.

14:07.481 --> 14:09.123
That beats anything I've ever seen.

14:09.143 --> 14:12.287
That's as bad as a man setting fire to his own house.

14:12.307 --> 14:13.589
So don't do that, friends.

14:14.090 --> 14:15.251
We've run out of time here.

14:15.271 --> 14:19.217
We're going to have to go, but before we go, I'd like to leave a final thought with you.

14:19.918 --> 14:21.520
The only way to keep timber...

14:21.854 --> 14:25.722
markets going is to keep timber growing.

14:25.742 --> 14:27.425
We've got to go friends, but we'll be back.

14:27.525 --> 14:28.627
Yes, sir.

14:28.647 --> 14:34.499
We've been brought to you by your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's forestry service.

14:34.599 --> 14:35.741
I want to thank you for listening.

14:35.761 --> 14:38.266
We'll be back under this same old pine tree.

14:38.687 --> 14:41.432
Just listen to your announcer and he'll let you know.
