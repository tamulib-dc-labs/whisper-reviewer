00:00.000 --> 00:12.468
[Silence.]

00:12.468 --> 00:13.169
Hello, friends.

00:13.229 --> 00:18.894
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

00:18.914 --> 00:30.565
When you consider that nine out of every ten forest and woods fires is started carelessly or otherwise by just plain folks, well, it makes a fellow feel that he's come from a long line of foolish people, don't it?

00:31.166 --> 00:33.188
So let's cut out this foolishness.

00:33.208 --> 00:35.930
Let's start a long line of careful people instead.

00:36.871 --> 00:37.432
We can do it.

00:37.452 --> 00:42.036
Just remember that only we, you and I, can prevent forest fires.

00:42.036 --> 01:01.304
[Silence.]

01:01.304 --> 01:01.965
Hello, friends.

01:01.985 --> 01:07.670
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

01:07.690 --> 01:14.817
When it comes to protection against wildfires, the best insurance I know is being prepared instead of waiting until it's too late.

01:15.237 --> 01:21.103
Apply a rake or fire line around your place, your hay field, or anything else you'd hate to get burned up.

01:21.123 --> 01:25.767
That's one of the best ways I know, to save yourself, your neighbor, a lot of money.

01:25.987 --> 01:29.050
Remember, only you can prevent wildfires.

01:29.050 --> 01:45.213
[Silence.]

01:45.213 --> 01:45.914
Hello, friends.

01:45.934 --> 01:51.221
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

01:51.241 --> 01:55.748
Did you know that nearly 20,000 forest fires start each year from carelessness?

01:56.489 --> 01:58.071
With burning trash or brush?

01:58.531 --> 01:59.332
Well, that's a fact.

01:59.833 --> 02:01.475
So please be careful.

02:01.495 --> 02:04.820
If you've got any burning to do, pick the right day in the weather.

02:05.221 --> 02:07.624
Plow or rake a good line around it.

02:07.644 --> 02:09.887
Have tools, water, and help handy.

02:10.137 --> 02:11.980
Tell the fire warden when you're going to burn.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.126
Because remember, only you can keep fire from running wild.

02:16.126 --> 02:31.268
[Silence.]

02:31.268 --> 02:31.909
Hello, friends.

02:31.929 --> 02:37.677
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

02:37.697 --> 02:39.520
You can take my word for it.

02:39.618 --> 02:49.074
It ain't no fun fighting forest fires, but more important than that, when forests burn, valuable timber's lost and jobs too.

02:49.094 --> 02:51.158
So please keep this in mind.

02:51.178 --> 02:58.490
For the good of our country, its strength and its security, and for your own good, be careful with your matches and smokes.

02:58.671 --> 03:01.896
And remember, only you can prevent forest fires.

03:01.896 --> 03:11.731
[Silence.]

03:11.731 --> 03:17.340
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

03:17.761 --> 03:20.125
This is about a forest fire.

03:20.145 --> 03:21.728
It doesn't take much to start it.

03:22.289 --> 03:30.202
Some dry grass, a leaf or a dry twig, one tiny spark and a bit of a breeze, and the little fire grows big.

03:30.222 --> 03:33.688
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

03:33.688 --> 03:51.877
[Silence.]

03:51.877 --> 03:59.325
Hello, friends.

03:59.345 --> 04:04.311
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliot, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

04:05.011 --> 04:09.536
If you're going hunting, fishing, or camping anytime soon, I wish you'd keep this in mind.

04:10.117 --> 04:13.741
Now, it doesn't take much to start a roaring forest fire.

04:13.761 --> 04:17.565
I know, because I've seen it happen, and I've fought many a fire.

04:17.585 --> 04:19.487
So please be careful.

04:19.670 --> 04:21.898
Put out your warming fire, your campfire.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.045
Put it dead out every time.

04:24.547 --> 04:27.317
Remember, only you can prevent forest fires.

04:27.317 --> 04:43.936
[Silence]

04:43.936 --> 04:45.057
Hello, friends.

04:45.077 --> 04:50.402
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

04:50.923 --> 04:53.725
Now, I'm a country boy, and I know what I'm talking about.

04:54.486 --> 04:56.488
Forest fires are mean business.

04:57.049 --> 05:02.374
They can sure ruin the land, start erosion, and cause floods.

05:02.394 --> 05:04.816
I've seen it happen time and time again.

05:05.196 --> 05:08.580
So please be careful with fire, always.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.142
Remember, only you can prevent forest fires.

05:11.142 --> 05:29.971
[Silence.]

05:29.971 --> 05:31.073
Hello, friends.

05:31.093 --> 05:36.042
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

05:36.723 --> 05:44.958
When it comes to forest and woods fires, did you ever stop to think how foolish a man is, burning up what God intended to grow and prosper?

05:45.699 --> 05:50.848
Think about that, friends, and remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

05:50.848 --> 06:05.695
[Silence.]

06:05.695 --> 06:06.877
Hello, friends.

06:06.897 --> 06:13.409
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

06:13.429 --> 06:18.538
If you're going hunting soon, remember the woods and the forest that give you the game that you're hunting.

06:19.099 --> 06:22.385
Remember, we get timber and water and other things from them.

06:22.986 --> 06:27.214
And remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fire.

06:27.214 --> 06:44.052
[Silence.]

06:44.052 --> 06:45.094
Hello, friends.

06:45.114 --> 06:50.502
This is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, hoping you'll stop whatever you're doing for just a little bit and listen.

06:51.363 --> 07:01.478
Now, I know that hunters and fishermen don't mean to be careless, but the records show that they get a little excited after they've hooked a nice fish, shot a buck, or a squirrel.

07:02.299 --> 07:05.023
That's when they usually get careless with their matches and smoke.

07:05.844 --> 07:07.807
Now, don't you be one of these careless ones.

07:08.608 --> 07:11.713
Remember, only you can prevent forest fires.

07:11.713 --> 7:24.000
[Silence.]
