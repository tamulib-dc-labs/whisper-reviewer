00:39.772 --> 00:40.733
Thank you, Heidi, friend.

00:40.753 --> 00:42.475
How are you all?

00:42.495 --> 00:45.198
Hope everybody's feeling fine today, and you guessed it again.

00:45.819 --> 00:55.471
It's your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott, and all the knotheads gathered up here under the old pine tree, and we're going to play some tunes that we've had lots and lots of requests for, and we do hope that you're going to enjoy them.

00:55.511 --> 01:01.878
So just relax, and here we go with the first one, featuring Bob and his strata-potato fiddle, and it's a chicken song.

01:01.898 --> 01:03.180
Yes, sir, Chicken Reel.

01:18.635 --> 01:20.983
Go ahead and go ahead and go.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.350
Well, thank you, Bobby.

01:57.390 --> 01:57.971
Thank you, boy.

01:58.312 --> 02:00.454
Bob didn't forget to put that bandy in there, did he?

02:01.536 --> 02:02.316
Well, that's all right.

02:02.577 --> 02:04.960
Friends, I wanted to tell you about a couple of my uncles.

02:04.980 --> 02:09.285
I got two uncles, and there's really a lot of difference in them, and I wanted to tell you about them.

02:09.365 --> 02:09.866
Uncle Ed.

02:10.747 --> 02:13.630
Uncle Ed there, I got an Uncle Charlie, and I got Uncle Ed.

02:13.751 --> 02:22.501
Well, Uncle Ed, he's one of those fellas, for an example, that he still got it in his head that he's got to burn every year.

02:22.521 --> 02:23.843
I don't know why.

02:24.262 --> 02:27.726
It seems that Uncle Ed would learn, but he still burns.

02:28.447 --> 02:32.372
And every year when he gets ready to burn, he takes no precautions whatsoever.

02:32.412 --> 02:34.055
He clears a new ground or anything.

02:34.095 --> 02:37.419
He just gets out there and burns when the notion strikes him.

02:38.620 --> 02:43.126
And as I said, it looks like that he would learn someday.

02:43.507 --> 02:53.880
Now, I don't care if these two uncles of mine are listening because it'll do Uncle Charlie some good, and it won't hurt Uncle Ed any more than he's already hurt himself.

02:54.265 --> 02:57.069
so I guess it don't make any difference.

02:57.089 --> 03:01.654
As I said, he's been one of these old-fashioned wood burners for years and years, ever since I can remember.

03:02.115 --> 03:06.640
He burns for snakes and bull weavers and ticks, and then he burns just to be burning.

03:07.562 --> 03:11.927
I guess he just likes to smell the leaves burning or something, I don't know.

03:11.947 --> 03:16.813
He never plows a fire lane, and he always waits for a good dry day.

03:16.913 --> 03:18.315
Now, as I said, he burns for

03:18.683 --> 03:20.045
We'll say snakes.

03:20.065 --> 03:24.733
Who ever heard of burning off 40 acres of land there to try to burn up one or two snakes?

03:25.134 --> 03:26.376
And he can't do it to start with.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.079
The snake's got more sense than he's got.

03:28.119 --> 03:30.643
He'll go in a hole and the fire passes over, he comes out.

03:31.544 --> 03:36.152
Well, he was going to burn for, if he goes to burn for, we'll say for bull weevils.

03:36.537 --> 03:45.509
Well, a bull weaver, he'll take his whole family in the fall, and he'll find him a good old wet, soggy, doughty chunk and get just as far down in it as he can get, and there's where he'll stay.

03:46.129 --> 03:49.354
Fire and sleet and snow or nothing else is going to harm him.

03:49.394 --> 03:51.997
In the spring, he's ready to go again, him and his whole family.

03:52.898 --> 03:54.640
Well, you take burning for ticks.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.963
That's the most impossible thing I ever heard of.

03:56.984 --> 04:01.529
Well, you'd have to catch all the varmints and everything and clean them up ticks first.

04:01.549 --> 04:03.051
Even turtles have snakes on them.

04:03.071 --> 04:04.333
So, you see, that's impossible.

04:04.533 --> 04:05.995
Possible to burn for ticks.

04:06.175 --> 04:26.440
I mean the snake the turtles have ticks on them Well, I get excited about these things friends don't hold it against me I can't help it but uncle ed is one of those kind of fellas He burned every year now he ought to learn better because uncle ed I know friends he's in the family and I know uncle ed has spent a lot of money for fines and

04:26.757 --> 04:37.020
And for cost of putting out fire and letting it run wild, burning up other people's fence, he'd have to go over and rebuild their fences and buy a new post and all that sort of thing.

04:38.215 --> 04:40.939
But you can go to Uncle Ed's place, friends.

04:40.959 --> 04:44.544
You can go to his house, and you can just look around the surroundings.

04:44.564 --> 04:47.828
His house and surroundings will tell you just what sort of fellow he is.

04:48.229 --> 04:50.192
He's got old, poor, run-down land.

04:50.212 --> 04:55.759
There's gullies washed down through it that's impossible to plow within 100 yards of them.

04:55.779 --> 04:57.722
And his house there looks like an old barn.

04:57.802 --> 05:03.430
He don't believe in painting, I don't guess, because there's never been a drop of paint on the house unless somebody...

05:03.730 --> 05:25.502
threw it on accidentally there's something because he don't believe in those things well you can look at his place and tell the old barns is run down and stock is poor his old mules don't look like they could pull a plow which they couldn't if he plowed more than an inch deep and all that sort of thing and his cows his milk cows everything well you can just look at the place and you you can tell that uncle ed is one of those kind of fellows

05:26.225 --> 05:31.611
I got another uncle, but first I want to tell you about this tune here that I believe Bob's going to sing.

05:32.212 --> 05:33.554
And it's a mighty pretty tune.

05:33.594 --> 05:34.975
Bob does a good job on it.

05:34.995 --> 05:37.038
It's a mean woman with green eyes.

05:44.367 --> 05:51.355
It takes a mean woman with a green eye to make me want to change her name.

05:59.857 --> 06:01.101
My baby's jealous.

06:01.302 --> 06:02.907
She says that I'm her man.

06:03.188 --> 06:06.640
She done and blow her lid, but she didn't hurt again.

06:06.660 --> 06:10.834
She's a mean woman with the green eyes.

06:11.617 --> 06:12.921
Oh, Lordy, what a gal.

06:43.360 --> 06:51.111
It takes a mean woman with a green eye to make me want to navigate.

06:51.131 --> 06:58.081
It takes a mean woman with a green eye to start my blood to circulate.

06:58.662 --> 07:00.785
Well, my baby ain't no doctor.

07:01.065 --> 07:02.888
She ain't no doctor's nurse.

07:30.712 --> 07:32.795
Thank you, Bob.

07:32.995 --> 07:54.927
Thank you.

07:55.047 --> 07:56.449
That was very nicely done, Nick.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.349
Yes, sir, that was all right.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.072
Now, friends, you've heard about my Uncle Ed.

08:00.553 --> 08:02.636
I wanted to tell you a little dab here about Uncle Charlie.

08:03.077 --> 08:05.821
Uncle Charlie is my favorite uncle.

08:05.861 --> 08:11.270
I don't mind telling you that because Uncle Charlie, he's a very prosperous man.

08:11.971 --> 08:16.798
And Uncle Charlie's found out years ago that it don't pay to burn for snakes, ticks, and bull eagles.

08:17.519 --> 08:19.422
So, I mean, he's learned all these things.

08:20.204 --> 08:24.951
Now, when Uncle Charlie clears him a new ground, he clears it off good.

08:25.184 --> 08:34.576
and he clears it just like most anybody else would, except he makes very small brush piles because he's learned by making small brush piles that it will completely burn up.

08:34.656 --> 08:42.766
He don't have all these old charted-over chunks to contend with all the year and finally have to hook up to the wagon and haul them out to get rid of them.

08:43.387 --> 08:50.756
By making these small piles, you can take better care of it and keep it raked up in a closer pile and burn up everything in it.

08:50.776 --> 08:52.639
I was over at Uncle Charlie's house the other day.

08:52.839 --> 08:54.381
I go by and visit him pretty often.

08:55.289 --> 09:01.117
Well, I say the other day, it was in the spring, and I was helping him do some clearing and burning.

09:01.157 --> 09:02.439
I went out there and helped him a while.

09:03.380 --> 09:07.726
Well, he got ready to burn off this new ground, and I happened to be over there.

09:08.727 --> 09:12.292
Well, Uncle Charlie had plowed a safety line all the way around the whole thing.

09:12.392 --> 09:21.364
Everything that he was going to burn, he got out there with his mules, and he plowed a good fire lane, a good, wide fire lane, something that he was sure a fire couldn't jump over.

09:22.238 --> 09:29.488
And he hooked the mules to a slide, and he had a lot of water haul down there, two or three barrels of water.

09:29.969 --> 09:35.477
Had plenty of buckets there, and he had some tools, rakes and shovels and fire flaps and that sort of thing.

09:36.418 --> 09:41.646
And then he invited some of the neighbors to come over that day when he was going to burn, had them standing by.

09:41.726 --> 09:45.491
Everybody was chewing the rag around there and just kind of enjoying it.

09:45.511 --> 09:49.697
It was sort of a country get-together there, in other words.

09:50.437 --> 09:56.045
Well, Uncle Charlie always waits for the proper day to burn, and he had picked out this day, and sure enough, it was just right.

09:56.065 --> 10:02.553
It wasn't too dry, and it wasn't but just a little bit of a breeze blowing, and it wasn't too hot that day.

10:02.994 --> 10:06.419
Well, everything was ready to start burning, to start to fire.

10:06.519 --> 10:11.245
In other words, we was all going to start setting brush heaps around and everything, and Uncle Charlie held up the whole bunch.

10:11.265 --> 10:13.188
He said, wait just a minute.

10:13.208 --> 10:17.113
Well, he run up to the house right quick and made a phone call.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.435
He called the forestry office.

10:18.905 --> 10:21.808
told the boys that he was going to burn right then.

10:21.948 --> 10:27.413
Now, he had called them several days before and told them he was planning on burning, but he didn't know exactly what day.

10:27.833 --> 10:34.719
So he went up there and called the forestry office and told them he was fixing to burn right then, and he wanted to notify them before he started.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.102
So that's exactly what he'd done.

10:38.142 --> 10:41.065
That's what everybody should do, and Uncle Charlie did that.

10:42.146 --> 10:44.548
Well, that burning went off, friends, just one, two, three.

10:44.568 --> 10:45.549
I mean, it was perfect.

10:46.650 --> 10:48.912
Uncle Charlie has got a nice place.

10:49.330 --> 10:52.715
He's got a place that I'd be proud to own or anybody would be proud to own.

10:53.176 --> 10:54.978
He's got some fine stock.

10:55.359 --> 10:58.283
He's got a good start of cattle on improved pasture.

10:58.684 --> 11:00.787
And everybody's going in for improved pastures.

11:00.807 --> 11:03.430
You can just ride through the country and see them all up and down the road.

11:04.332 --> 11:06.014
Well, Uncle Charlie's got a nice place.

11:06.355 --> 11:08.718
And his place, friends, you can look at his place.

11:08.738 --> 11:15.608
You can look at Uncle Charlie's barns and his pastures and his new grounds and his fences and his gates and all that sort of thing.

11:15.993 --> 11:21.341
And you can just about sum up in your own mind just what sort of fellow Uncle Charlie is.

11:22.022 --> 11:27.190
He's plenty full of goodness, friends, and he's a real uncle, and I'm really proud of Uncle Charlie.

11:27.230 --> 11:29.433
Here's the next tune, friends, and it features Herman.

11:29.653 --> 11:34.120
Herman is going to play the Blue Steel Blues.

12:13.857 --> 12:14.463
.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.877
.

12:40.823 --> 12:42.585
Thank you, Herman.

12:42.625 --> 12:42.925
Thank you.

12:42.945 --> 12:44.607
That's fine steel playing there, buddy.

12:44.868 --> 12:50.835
Now, friends, you can drive through the country and you can just look at the homes and you can tell just about what sort of family lives in them.

12:51.095 --> 12:52.997
Just by Uncle Charlie and Uncle Ed here.

12:53.258 --> 12:54.499
And I want you to keep it in mind.

12:54.799 --> 12:55.881
Friends, we've run out of time.

12:55.901 --> 12:56.802
We've got to go here.

12:57.202 --> 13:01.908
But before we go, here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you.

13:01.928 --> 13:07.354
The good Lord surely had this plan in his mind when he put land and trees here for us.

13:07.537 --> 13:12.002
Not to abuse or not to burn over in hate, but to protect and use right.

13:12.343 --> 13:14.606
That's our trust.

13:25.519 --> 13:29.844
Well, friends, that brings to a close our little visit with you today here under the old pine tree.

13:30.405 --> 13:33.088
And we do hope that you've heard something that you like.

13:34.672 --> 13:46.297
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:46.678 --> 13:47.340
We'll be back.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.845
Listen to the local announcer, and he'll let you know when.

13:51.057 --> 13:54.628
Friends, remember, only you can prevent woods fires.

13:55.651 --> 14:04.780
Now let's go home.

14:19.492 --> 14:34.935
Thank you.
