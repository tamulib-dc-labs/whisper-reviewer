WEBVTT

00:38.506 --> 00:40.789
Well, thank you, boys.

00:40.809 --> 00:41.370
Howdy, friends.

00:41.390 --> 00:41.931
How are y'all?

00:42.232 --> 00:42.612
Yes, sir.

00:42.632 --> 00:43.654
Here it is once again.

00:43.754 --> 00:45.497
Time for Jelly Elliot and the Knoth Head.

00:45.977 --> 00:52.327
Friends, we're right here today sitting under a big old oak tree right out here on the bank of good old Washtenaw River.

00:53.128 --> 00:59.177
And we're going to come your way there for the next few minutes, coming to you direct from this old oak tree.

00:59.197 --> 00:59.958
So just relax.

01:00.018 --> 01:00.880
Pull up a chair there.

01:01.821 --> 01:04.345
First thing we're going to do is take and yodel the team here.

01:04.848 --> 01:06.952
We get a lot of requests to this tune, so here we go.

01:06.992 --> 01:08.655
I'm going to try to sing it myself.

01:08.675 --> 01:09.456
Deep Water.

01:11.941 --> 01:21.438
I'm drifting into deep water.

01:21.458 --> 01:24.443
I'm starting to care for you.

01:25.283 --> 01:30.309
You're getting me in deep water.

01:30.389 --> 01:36.036
Be careful what you do.

01:36.097 --> 01:39.521
You want a romance, but I'm seeking love.

01:40.162 --> 01:44.107
I know I regret it when it ends.

01:46.430 --> 01:49.533
I'm winding up in deep water.

01:50.435 --> 01:53.198
Why can't we just be friends?

01:54.511 --> 01:57.554
Well, there it is, friends.

01:57.595 --> 01:58.656
It's kind of short and sweet.

01:58.676 --> 01:59.717
Thank you a lot there, boys.

02:00.197 --> 02:07.866
Now, friends, for a long, long time, you know, the Knotheads and myself, we've been coming and visiting with you in your homes out there, through your radios and all that.

02:08.187 --> 02:11.490
But today, today, I want you to come out and visit with me.

02:11.510 --> 02:14.213
I think it's time for you to come over to my house.

02:14.233 --> 02:16.536
Now, George, I've been coming to see you a long time, so...

02:16.904 --> 02:18.986
We've made all kinds of arrangements.

02:19.026 --> 02:21.929
We've run a wire, run a wire way out there.

02:22.250 --> 02:27.235
You know, we're back here about six miles from the main highway, right on the banks of the Ouachita River.

02:27.275 --> 02:28.156
That's the hook or hold.

02:28.897 --> 02:33.121
And we got a wire run out here, friends, for these electric equipment and stuff and things.

02:34.022 --> 02:36.585
And I just want you to come out and visit with me.

02:36.665 --> 02:39.047
I'm standing here on the bank of the river, and I can look around.

02:39.147 --> 02:40.349
I can see pine trees.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.371
There's some pine trees here.

02:42.551 --> 02:43.192
Not too many.

02:43.732 --> 02:44.413
Mostly oak.

02:44.849 --> 02:47.152
Moss hanging from all the oak trees.

02:47.713 --> 02:49.134
It's really pretty.

02:49.154 --> 02:50.676
It's a lot prettier in the spring.

02:50.696 --> 02:52.839
I wish you could come out in the spring.

02:52.859 --> 03:00.789
Well, it's really beautiful out here in the spring when the trees are full of green leaves and you can hear the birds singing along about corn planting time.

03:00.809 --> 03:02.030
You can hear the red bird.

03:06.716 --> 03:07.557
Everybody hears that.

03:07.577 --> 03:09.279
They know it's time to go to planting corn.

03:10.761 --> 03:11.281
Yes, sir.

03:11.301 --> 03:11.802
That's right.

03:12.322 --> 03:18.181
Well, friends, I just wanted to kind of give you a picture of my home out here.

03:18.201 --> 03:18.963
Here's the next tune.

03:19.244 --> 03:20.127
All right, George, here we go.

03:20.588 --> 03:21.672
And Herman's going to play this.

03:21.692 --> 03:25.183
This is a little old steel tune called Railroad, and let's have a son.

03:42.983 --> 03:44.527
.

03:44.547 --> 03:44.747
.

03:45.750 --> 03:57.921
.

04:17.746 --> 04:28.142
Well, son, that's what I call railroading.

04:28.623 --> 04:31.387
Yes, sir, that's a mighty good steel tuner.

04:31.407 --> 04:36.335
I've been telling you from time to time that I live out in the woods, and I know a lot of you out there don't believe it.

04:36.355 --> 04:37.336
But it's right.

04:37.357 --> 04:40.041
And I would just love to have any of you, all of you.

04:40.081 --> 04:42.825
I wish it was possible that you could come out here and visit with me.

04:43.649 --> 04:45.531
We got a nice place out here.

04:45.551 --> 04:46.752
We think we like it.

04:46.812 --> 04:49.855
It's something I've wanted all my life, and I've got it.

04:49.875 --> 04:51.477
And I'm really happy over it.

04:51.497 --> 04:56.703
And I'd just like for all my friends to be able to come out here and share it with me.

04:56.723 --> 04:57.523
We really enjoy it.

04:57.563 --> 05:00.146
Now, right now, my wife's up there at the camp, Delora.

05:00.627 --> 05:02.729
She's at the camp right now, frying fish.

05:02.749 --> 05:05.592
We're going to have, we've got some friends here today visiting with us.

05:06.353 --> 05:08.975
And we're fixing to have a big fish fry.

05:08.995 --> 05:10.757
And everybody enjoy it.

05:11.258 --> 05:13.420
And I wish that you could come out and eat fish with us.

05:13.906 --> 05:15.308
because we've got some nice ones.

05:15.748 --> 05:19.132
Washtenaw River's got a lot of them, and we're getting more every day.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.654
I'm going to tell you some more about that, too.

05:21.636 --> 05:24.419
And the lowest-frying fish, some of the friends are sitting around.

05:24.439 --> 05:30.406
There's some of them on logs around here, and some sitting on sawhorses, and some of them's walking around here in the leaves.

05:30.426 --> 05:33.671
You can hear the leaves, because there's a lot of dead leaves on the ground.

05:33.691 --> 05:38.116
Got a little breeze blowing today right out across the hooker hole here, and it's just a little bit chilly.

05:38.136 --> 05:41.700
Not too much, but you can kind of feel it.

05:41.721 --> 05:42.141
And, uh,

05:42.593 --> 05:44.176
Everything's shaping up Monday night.

05:45.257 --> 05:49.124
Right here where I'm standing, friends, I can look across the river over there.

05:49.144 --> 05:51.568
We have a reserve, a game reserve.

05:51.648 --> 05:55.494
I can look over there, and you heard that noise in the background.

05:55.514 --> 05:56.716
That's my horse.

05:56.736 --> 06:00.122
He just seen something that he didn't seem to like so well.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.143
But that's all right, Bob.

06:01.183 --> 06:02.405
Everything will be all right, son.

06:02.646 --> 06:04.368
He's standing by, friends, believe it or not.

06:04.649 --> 06:07.774
I have him tied right here within 20 feet of myself.

06:08.581 --> 06:11.104
But as I was telling you, I can look across the reserve over there.

06:11.144 --> 06:19.474
Lots of times I can sit down right here on my step and sit here and watch squirrels playing over there, running up and down the bank.

06:19.514 --> 06:21.216
And I can see an old dead tree over there.

06:21.236 --> 06:24.239
There's a hoot owl dimmed in that old tree.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.122
And at night out here, when we're sitting out on the porch, you can hear him.

06:28.304 --> 06:32.409
And, well, I just wish you could be here.

06:32.449 --> 06:33.630
Let's play another tune, boys.

06:33.670 --> 06:36.293
I hope that you've kind of got a layout as to what this

06:36.610 --> 06:38.152
camp looks like out here, friends.

06:38.292 --> 06:39.673
Well, boys, I'll tell you what let's do.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.896
Let's just all gather up here and go and talk something.

06:41.916 --> 06:43.278
What do you think about it, Jack?

06:43.298 --> 06:44.078
I'll tell you what you do.

06:44.359 --> 06:48.503
You start blowing the horn there, Jack, and get the dogs gathered up, and I'll see what I can do, and we'll just go.

06:48.824 --> 06:55.191
Yeah, yeah.

06:55.431 --> 06:58.855
Yeah, yeah.

06:59.122 --> 07:04.249
Is all the dogs here?

07:04.269 --> 07:06.752
Yeah, I believe they're here, Jack.

07:06.812 --> 07:08.675
Let's go, son.

07:08.735 --> 07:15.744
I believe he's got a trail there, Jack.

07:15.904 --> 07:22.853
He's got a trail.

07:22.933 --> 07:26.678
Pull the door.

07:26.698 --> 07:27.880
Pull the door.

07:27.860 --> 07:33.126
That's a cold trail, Jack.

07:33.286 --> 07:37.371
Oh, yeah.

07:37.551 --> 07:42.757
Oh, he's going now, Jack.

07:42.797 --> 07:51.567
He's going to trim in a minute.

07:52.628 --> 07:53.749
Woo!

07:53.729 --> 07:57.178
Oh, man, he's gon' see him there.

07:57.198 --> 08:01.710
There's them little pups in here.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.958
Yeah, there's them puppies.

08:05.018 --> 08:09.510
Get out of here, puppy!

08:09.490 --> 08:31.182
Okay, I guess that takes care of that.

08:31.242 --> 08:38.873
Now that we've got the fox trees and colts and everything, why you boys just drag up a chunk and sit down there and be real quiet because I've got some more

08:39.055 --> 08:40.577
things here I want to get off my chest.

08:41.738 --> 08:50.009
Neighbors, we gather up here on the bank of the river a lot of times, and we just have more fun with these fiddles and guitars of picking and singing.

08:50.029 --> 08:55.676
In fact, we get a lot of inspirations for some of the songs that we write right here on the bank of the river.

08:55.696 --> 08:59.481
And if you was out here, you could probably do the same.

09:00.802 --> 09:04.307
Years ago here, why, it was a little different.

09:05.047 --> 09:05.468
And, uh,

09:06.376 --> 09:08.678
But now, there's no fires go through here.

09:08.878 --> 09:11.801
We haven't had any fires through here in years.

09:11.821 --> 09:14.003
And our fish are getting more plentiful.

09:14.023 --> 09:15.284
Our game is more plentiful.

09:16.125 --> 09:20.209
And, well, it just, everything is better.

09:20.229 --> 09:22.031
Everybody's working that wants to work.

09:22.051 --> 09:25.334
They're working because there's plenty of jobs in the timber around here.

09:26.014 --> 09:28.096
We have sawmills out here.

09:28.497 --> 09:29.658
A lot of people work there.

09:29.798 --> 09:31.860
Everybody works hand in hand.

09:31.880 --> 09:32.801
And it's mighty nice.

09:32.861 --> 09:35.083
And I just wish everybody could

09:35.367 --> 09:38.270
see this thing and get together and work together.

09:39.031 --> 09:40.253
It'd be so much nicer.

09:41.134 --> 09:43.596
And we're growing little trees here.

09:45.298 --> 09:49.844
We got lots of old fields that set out here with little trees, little pine trees.

09:49.864 --> 09:53.788
I've got two little girls, two little knotheads, and they're off at school right now.

09:54.269 --> 09:55.670
They're off at school.

09:55.690 --> 10:04.260
And it's mighty nice, friends, to go out here and look around and see these little pine trees coming along and go to school to pick up the kids and see them little fellas running around the schoolhouse there.

10:05.202 --> 10:10.030
And it's mighty nice to know that these little pine trees is growing up with them little kids.

10:10.952 --> 10:14.297
I tell you, it makes you have a good feeling.

10:14.317 --> 10:23.613
And getting back to this river out here and camp, as I told you a while ago, we sit here sometimes, look across the river and see squirrels playing over there.

10:24.334 --> 10:31.125
And then it's a common thing to walk out here on the porch and hear something over in the reserve go like this.

10:33.535 --> 10:42.465
You know what that is?

10:43.066 --> 10:44.347
That's a squirrel.

10:44.367 --> 10:46.650
He's seen something over there.

10:46.670 --> 10:50.935
He might have looked over here and seen us, and he didn't like our look.

10:50.955 --> 10:52.537
That all sounds good to me, friends.

10:52.557 --> 10:53.738
That's music to my ears.

10:55.140 --> 10:56.421
Yes, sir, and...

10:57.093 --> 11:01.759
We, as I said, we want to invite any and all of you out here to see us any time.

11:01.779 --> 11:06.104
We'll be glad to have you all we ask, just to be careful with your cigarettes and matches.

11:06.524 --> 11:07.225
Well, let's see.

11:07.245 --> 11:08.687
We've got another tune coming up here.

11:09.027 --> 11:11.030
It's an old-timey waltz tune.

11:11.050 --> 11:16.096
Now, we've got some old-timers visiting with us today, and we think you'll like it too, and here's Jack the Fiddly for you.

11:16.116 --> 11:17.117
Jack does a good job.

11:17.157 --> 11:18.679
The Wednesday night waltz, Jack.

11:54.215 --> 12:11.551
All that money for it, sir.

12:11.952 --> 12:23.142
All that money for it.

12:36.065 --> 12:38.368
Thank you, Jack, thank you.

12:38.388 --> 12:41.151
That was a mighty pretty old waltz there.

12:41.171 --> 12:42.593
It just never will get old.

12:43.614 --> 12:49.822
Now, before we go, friends, there's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you here, and I'd like for you to thank it over.

12:51.063 --> 13:00.935
Now that you know firsthand how my place looks, I'm hoping you'll understand why I keep hammering at wild wood fires.

13:01.416 --> 13:03.338
They're bad for any man's land.

13:03.942 --> 13:27.180
Well, friends, that kind of brings to a close our little visit here with you under the old oak tree and the moss hanging around right on the back of the good old Washtar River.

13:27.701 --> 13:28.983
We have sure enjoyed it.

13:29.003 --> 13:30.405
We hope that you have, neighbors.

13:31.128 --> 13:32.651
We hope you'll come to see us again.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.013
Listen to your local announcement.

13:34.033 --> 13:36.618
He'll let you know when we'll be back.

13:36.638 --> 13:46.857
Remember, friends, this program is made possible and brought to you the best weekly compliments from your own forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:47.518 --> 13:51.145
Remember, neighbors, only you can prevent forest fires.
