00:09.000 --> 00:24.839
[Music.]

00:24.839 --> 00:26.149
Well, howdy, friend. How are y'all?

00:27.172 --> 00:29.397
This is Jelly Elliott, and the three Knotheads.

00:29.417 --> 00:30.780
That's the old wood driver.

00:31.435 --> 00:41.652
We're going to be sitting with you for a spell here about the next 14 and a half minutes, brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from the State Forestry Service and Uncle Sam's Forestry Service.

00:41.672 --> 00:46.680
We're just sitting here under the old pine tree down the trail, so just come right on down here.

00:47.121 --> 00:47.982
Make yourself at home.

00:48.002 --> 00:49.605
We'd like to have you stick around with us.

00:49.625 --> 00:52.009
We're going to pick and sing.

00:52.069 --> 00:52.550
Hey!

00:53.491 --> 00:54.092
Yes, sir.

00:54.212 --> 00:55.755
I'm telling you, we just...

00:55.735 --> 00:57.638
Oh, we're feeling fine today.

00:57.758 --> 01:05.129
All the boys who's gathered up here just like they had good sense, and we're going to play and sing some of the songs that we've got a lot of requests for.

01:05.229 --> 01:06.671
First, we're going to sing a song here.

01:07.693 --> 01:08.734
Deacon ought to sing a song.

01:09.215 --> 01:10.417
I think he ought to, too.

01:10.998 --> 01:12.780
All right, you want to open up that?

01:12.800 --> 01:13.922
All right, we'll just do that then.

01:13.942 --> 01:18.729
We'll feature Deacon on this first tune with his double-barrel Ethiopian steam-heated butane-burning guitar.

01:18.789 --> 01:22.755
He's got a lap full of it, and here it goes with a little bit of the Roadside Rag.

01:22.755 --> 02:04.096
[Music.]

01:31.975 --> 01:42.820
Yeah.

02:04.096 --> 02:10.686
Well, all right there, Deacon.

02:10.706 --> 02:11.367
Thank you, buddy.

02:11.408 --> 02:16.075
There it was, friends, a Roadside Rag right here on the side of the trail under the old pine tree.

02:16.435 --> 02:23.827
And we hope that you enjoyed that tune a whole lot and will write to us a penny postcard or a letter will do the job, and we'll be glad to play it again for you.

02:24.128 --> 02:25.209
Deacon will be mighty glad.

02:25.229 --> 02:25.650
Huh, Deacon?

02:25.950 --> 02:26.511
Yes, sir.

02:26.772 --> 02:27.673
Yeah.

02:29.115 --> 02:30.778
That was mighty weak there, buddy.

02:32.615 --> 02:35.338
That reminds me of that fried chicken we had today.

02:35.939 --> 02:37.140
Fried fish we had.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.261
Boy, I'm telling you.

02:38.522 --> 02:46.090
You know, friends, I wanted to tell you all a little incident that happened to me here just a day or two ago.

02:46.110 --> 02:46.911
I went out here.

02:47.132 --> 02:50.936
I went out traveling around with the local state forestry feller.

02:51.156 --> 02:55.281
You know what that feller, the forestry feller, the state forest feller?

02:56.206 --> 02:59.330
We went out there to a farmer's house that had some woods.

02:59.470 --> 03:04.656
He had some woods, and he'd sent that state forester fellow word to come out there and see him.

03:04.857 --> 03:05.577
He wanted to see him.

03:05.617 --> 03:07.880
So we went out there, and we got out there.

03:07.920 --> 03:17.292
He wanted that state forester to look over his timber, look it over there and look around and see if he had anything that was worth cutting there, selling.

03:17.312 --> 03:22.458
You know, he wanted to see if it was ready to cut or sell and what would do to cut and what wouldn't.

03:22.778 --> 03:25.842
He just had a bunch of mixed woods there, pine trees.

03:26.142 --> 03:28.626
Timber mixed with hardwood, all kinds, you know.

03:28.666 --> 03:33.012
And I know all of you know what, just ordinary mixed wood.

03:33.913 --> 03:38.640
And that forestry feller, I'm telling you, we walked all over it.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.202
We went out there and walked around over it.

03:40.623 --> 03:42.746
And he surprised me and that farmer both.

03:43.828 --> 03:44.348
He sure did.

03:44.769 --> 03:50.337
He told that farmer, he says, feller, you got a crop of timber here that's ready for cutting right now.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.360
It's ready to harvest.

03:52.380 --> 03:53.702
And we went all over these woods.

03:54.509 --> 03:57.133
And he showed him there how much good timber he had.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.716
Pointed out the trees to cut and all that.

03:59.756 --> 04:02.080
Which ones not to cut and everything.

04:02.100 --> 04:05.885
And all along through the woods there, though, he kept shaking his head.

04:05.905 --> 04:07.046
He kept shaking his head.

04:07.127 --> 04:13.375
And he looked like he was satisfied, but he was dissatisfied or disappointed or something.

04:13.736 --> 04:15.658
I didn't know what in the world was the matter with him.

04:15.698 --> 04:18.683
And I asked him, I said, I stood as long as I could.

04:18.703 --> 04:20.505
And I said, what's the matter with you, fella?

04:20.585 --> 04:22.388
What you shaking your head about?

04:22.408 --> 04:24.010
I was talking to that forestry fella.

04:24.783 --> 04:26.946
And he said, boy, he said, just look here.

04:27.346 --> 04:31.211
Just look what the hogs and the cattle is doing to this timberland here.

04:32.352 --> 04:36.978
He says they're just tromping it down so hard that it would do for concrete.

04:36.998 --> 04:38.620
A tree couldn't come up if it wanted to.

04:38.780 --> 04:39.521
And he said, look here.

04:39.541 --> 04:46.670
And he showed me there some little young trees where a cow or a horse or something would come along there and bit the top out of it.

04:46.690 --> 04:47.691
Young timber.

04:47.711 --> 04:48.332
That was bad.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.694
He didn't like that so much.

04:50.535 --> 04:50.875
And...

04:51.023 --> 04:55.309
We fooled around there, and he told that farmer it had been burned off two or three times.

04:55.690 --> 04:57.052
You could tell it had been burned off.

04:57.312 --> 05:02.379
Some of the timber was mighty scrubby and looked awful sickly and everything.

05:02.399 --> 05:06.626
That's the ones he wanted to cut most of all, the forest fellow did.

05:06.646 --> 05:13.736
He told that farmer that he could sure make his woods pay off if he'd keep the fires and the cows out of them.

05:13.756 --> 05:16.660
And then he promised, he told that farmer, he said, now I'll be back.

05:17.315 --> 05:20.178
to help you mark these trees that ought to be cut.

05:20.318 --> 05:25.804
And the farmer promised him, he said, well, he said, if you're good enough to do that, he says, I'll fence it.

05:25.824 --> 05:26.345
I'll fence it.

05:26.385 --> 05:30.389
I'll build a fence around it and keep stock out, keep stock out.

05:31.130 --> 05:44.925
And I promised him, I promised both of them, I told him, I said, well, if y'all gonna do that, if you're gonna fence it, I told the farmer, if you're gonna fence it, I told that forest fellow, if you're gonna come back and help him look at it and cut it and see if he gets another crop here in a few years' time,

05:45.192 --> 05:47.282
Well, I'll be good enough to tell everybody about it.

05:47.322 --> 05:48.648
And so I've kept my word.

05:49.332 --> 05:52.165
And I'm sure that Forrester fellow has kept his.

05:52.651 --> 05:53.773
Now, it's up to the farmer.

05:53.973 --> 05:57.057
I don't know what he's done, whether he's built a fence or not, but I hope he does.

05:57.077 --> 05:57.498
Excuse me.

05:57.618 --> 05:58.859
Bass fiddle like fell down.

05:58.879 --> 06:01.984
I'm telling you, I have more trouble than this blooming bass fiddle.

06:02.084 --> 06:04.146
Anybody play a bass fiddle will do anything.

06:04.167 --> 06:05.608
Here's the next tune I'm going to sing.

06:05.669 --> 06:06.610
I can feel it coming on.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.472
I feel just as plain as a grown man.

06:08.492 --> 06:10.455
I'm going to sing a sad song here.

06:10.475 --> 06:18.726
I do all the heavy opera singing on the program here, friends, as you've already noticed in future programs, that I do all the opera singing.

06:18.746 --> 06:22.371
Here's the opera song here, The Kind of Love I Can't Forget.

06:28.325 --> 06:53.944
The kind of love I can't forget dear was the love you gave to me. I've had my chance and now I suffer.

06:54.245 --> 06:58.084
My heart is filled with misery.

06:58.908 --> 07:02.888
Your truly fond and faithful heart, dear

07:03.627 --> 07:20.790
Should have never known distress, And in my sorrow I am weeping. To you, sweetheart, I will confess. So why not take me back again, dear?

07:22.272 --> 07:30.883
We could live so happily. The kind of love I can't forget, dear

07:31.454 --> 07:34.137
Was the love you gave to me.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.621
Thank you, boys, thank you.

07:37.641 --> 07:40.024
There it is, the kind of love I can't forget.

07:40.805 --> 07:41.826
Boy, that's it, ain't it?

07:41.846 --> 07:43.228
The kind of love I can't forget.

07:43.268 --> 07:46.131
That's the kind, that's it.

07:46.151 --> 07:49.174
There's a lot of things I can't forget, though, friends.

07:49.255 --> 07:49.995
I'm telling you.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.697
Now, getting serious here.

07:52.658 --> 07:54.501
Now, this business is about growing timber.

07:54.901 --> 07:55.522
Good timber.

07:56.863 --> 07:58.305
It's just as simple as...

07:58.724 --> 08:05.115
It's just as simple as going out to the water shelf and water bucket and getting a drink of water once you get on to it.

08:06.458 --> 08:08.321
And anybody can do it.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.625
Why, anybody with half cents and one eye.

08:11.306 --> 08:15.914
Can't you stop there a minute and realize what it means to grow a good crop of timber?

08:15.975 --> 08:18.980
All you got to do is just keep the fire out of it.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.282
That's the main thing.

08:20.302 --> 08:21.905
That one word, fire.

08:21.925 --> 08:23.027
F-I-R-E.

08:23.497 --> 08:24.318
F-I-R-E.

08:24.338 --> 08:31.688
That's a four-letter word, but boy, it can destroy more than any other hundred-word letter that I know of.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.710
That's the worst thing that I know of.

08:33.791 --> 08:34.572
Fire.

08:34.592 --> 08:36.594
Everybody dreads fire.

08:36.614 --> 08:42.943
And just think, I know that you've seen in the past what fire I'll do to woods.

08:42.963 --> 08:45.266
Boy, you've just got to keep it out of the woods.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.749
Now, you can learn to grow a crop of timber.

08:49.012 --> 08:57.566
You can learn to grow copper timber just like you grow turnip greens, collards, and corn, cotton, potatoes, and anything, only it's a lot less work.

08:57.586 --> 08:58.367
It's a lot less work.

08:59.389 --> 09:02.233
Now, you can get one of your local forest boys to come out there.

09:02.293 --> 09:03.315
He'll come out to your house.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.520
You just send him word or write him, and he'll come.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.682
It won't cost you a thing.

09:08.082 --> 09:15.294
He'll be glad to come, and he's just an old country boy, just an old knot-headed country boy, and he'll come out there, and he'll tell you, friends.

09:15.314 --> 09:16.015
He'll show you.

09:16.332 --> 09:17.253
He's been trained.

09:17.273 --> 09:20.097
He already was raised in the woods to start with.

09:20.357 --> 09:22.340
You'd be surprised at what that boy knows.

09:23.481 --> 09:27.286
Just call him, write him, or send him word to come out to your house.

09:28.027 --> 09:40.884
And he'll be glad to come out there and show you and tell you and show you the points in keeping out the cows and hogs and how to cut your trees, when to cut them, which ones to cut, which ones to leave, the right time.

09:41.445 --> 09:43.167
Now, that's a way to get a steady...

09:43.703 --> 09:45.647
Steady crop of cash money.

09:45.787 --> 09:46.308
So try it.

09:46.749 --> 09:47.110
Let's see.

09:47.150 --> 09:47.771
We got here.

09:47.811 --> 09:49.374
We got several minutes left here.

09:49.474 --> 09:50.737
Time enough for another tune.

09:51.378 --> 09:53.842
And so I believe we're going to get Slim.

09:53.863 --> 09:55.466
Slim's going to come up here and sing a song.

09:55.806 --> 09:58.552
Yeah, he's going to sing one of Hank Williams' tunes here, friends.

09:58.572 --> 09:59.874
And here he is to do it.

09:59.894 --> 10:03.501
Slim doing Wedding Bells.

10:09.016 --> 10:14.707
I have the invitation that you sent me.

10:17.051 --> 10:22.461
You wanted me to see you change your name.

10:24.765 --> 10:27.210
I couldn't stand to see you wed another,

10:32.000 --> 10:54.649
but dear I hope you're happy just the same. Yes darling I hope you're happy. I planned a little cottage in the valley. I even bought a little band of gold.

10:55.118 --> 11:08.571
I thought someday I'd place it on your finger, But now the future looks so dark and cold. Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel

11:18.490 --> 11:47.788
that should be ringing now for you and me, but down the aisle with someone else you're walking. Those wedding bells will never ring for me. I fancy that I see a bunch of roses

11:50.063 --> 11:58.093
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair.

11:58.113 --> 12:04.341
While the organ plays, I love you truly.

12:05.583 --> 12:11.430
Please let me pretend that I am there.

12:17.536 --> 12:42.615
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel Ever since the day you set me free. I knew someday that you would wait another. Those wedding bells will never ring for me.

12:45.160 --> 12:45.841
Thank you, Sam.

12:45.881 --> 12:46.161
Thank you.

12:46.181 --> 12:48.464
There it is, friends, of Hank Williams' Wedding Bells.

12:48.504 --> 12:54.250
Now, I told you here at the beginning of the program, and I told you on the future program, the one before this, about the pictures.

12:54.270 --> 12:57.093
Now, we've got lots of requests for them, and they're yours.

12:57.373 --> 12:58.695
Free for the asking.

12:58.715 --> 12:59.756
That's all you've got to do.

12:59.776 --> 13:01.678
Sit down and write us a penny postcard or letter.

13:01.959 --> 13:11.389
Address your fan mail to Jelly Elliott and the three Knotheads in care of the station that you're now listening to, and we'll send you a picture of myself and the three knotheads.

13:11.649 --> 13:14.172
Be glad to, and we'd like for you to have this picture.

13:14.641 --> 13:15.706
and see what we look like.

13:17.194 --> 13:18.701
Don't be surprised, friend.

13:18.721 --> 13:22.761
I'm telling you, yeah, but we want you to have this picture, and if you want it,

13:22.910 --> 13:26.014
Just write us a penny postcard or letter saying, send me the picture.

13:26.034 --> 13:30.560
Put your name and address very plainly on the card or letter and address it to Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.541
Friends, we've run out of time.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.282
We're going to have to go.

13:32.582 --> 13:33.864
Got to shove on down the trail.

13:33.904 --> 13:37.048
We've really enjoyed visiting with you here under the old pine tree.

13:37.488 --> 13:38.289
And we'll be back.

13:38.389 --> 13:39.871
Listen to the announcer and he'll let you know.

13:40.232 --> 13:50.445
I'd like to tell you, friends, for the last 15, 14 and a half minutes, the Cowboys and myself has been brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's forestry service.

13:50.985 --> 13:52.427
Now, here's a little thought for the day.

13:53.183 --> 14:01.177
If you take care of your woods, you can eat your cake and have it too.

14:01.197 --> 14:05.534
Remember friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

14:05.534 --> 14:44.498
