00:00.000 --> 00:20.270
[Music.]

00:20.270 --> 00:32.817
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:33.218 --> 00:35.040
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.903
That was how he got his name.

00:37.283 --> 00:38.245
Hi there, friends.

00:38.385 --> 00:40.507
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodman.

00:41.168 --> 00:44.052
Glad you could come up this way again today up with the trail.

00:44.553 --> 00:49.820
So how about having a seat beside you here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:49.840 --> 00:51.722
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:52.462 --> 00:55.446
You know, that's because we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:56.668 --> 01:01.134
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

01:01.154 --> 01:07.001
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there, the Sons of the Pioneers.

01:07.582 --> 01:10.686
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail, too, again today.

01:10.706 --> 01:16.274
And now that you're here and comfortably settled, they're going to start off this little outdoor get-together of ours.

01:16.334 --> 01:20.359
So just relax and let's hear some mighty fine singing, huh?

01:22.600 --> 01:49.131
Simmer on, roll on To my lonely song. Carry me away From these skies of gray. Though I'm feeling blue, I'll roll on with you

01:59.843 --> 02:08.226
through the ocean blue, simmer on, roll on.

02:08.226 --> 02:33.000

02:33.000 --> 02:42.219
Oh, I'm feeling blue.

02:42.239 --> 02:44.803
I'll roll on with you.

02:44.823 --> 02:55.062
Through the ocean blue, simmer on.

03:01.690 --> 03:12.305
You know, friends, if there's any one particular thing that's the most important thing our forests and other so-called wild lands give us, it's water.

03:12.325 --> 03:20.256
Now, how can you put the price on a glass of water when you're thirsty or on the water that goes into cooking just about every meal?

03:20.276 --> 03:29.790
Now, you can measure the amount of water that creates power and that they run into fields to irrigate the crops or into the factories to turn out useful products of all kinds.

03:31.053 --> 03:36.860
When you put all this together, you come up with a lot of water and a money value that runs into millions of dollars.

03:37.861 --> 03:41.866
But when you get right down to it, remember this simple fact.

03:41.886 --> 03:43.868
Without water, we just couldn't live.

03:44.989 --> 03:54.160
Of course, we all know that, but the point I want to make is that we're almost completely dependent upon the forests and grass and brush-covered lands for the water we use.

03:55.361 --> 03:59.406
You know the old saying, you never miss the water until the well runs dry.

04:00.263 --> 04:06.131
Now, isn't that a pretty good reason for protecting these lands which give us our water supplies?

04:06.151 --> 04:12.400
So the next time you're down to the creek or lake to do a little bit of fishing, why, just give these things a little thought, will you?

04:13.962 --> 04:27.722
Well, I might have gone fishing Got a-thinking it over The road to that river Is a mighty long way It must be the season

04:28.360 --> 04:53.389
No rhyme or reason Just taking it easy It's my lazy day Well, never mind calling Cause I ain't a-coming Just get you on by me Stay out of my way Just a little deep thinking Would sure drive me drinking

04:54.213 --> 04:59.239
Just taking it easy, it's my lazy day.

04:59.960 --> 05:05.807
Well, finding it's easy just to mind my own business.

05:05.827 --> 05:10.492
I'm keeping my nose out of everyone's way.

05:11.733 --> 05:16.179
Ain't taking no water, ain't hiring no people.

05:17.380 --> 05:23.427
Just taking it easy, it's my lazy day.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.156
Yes, sir.

05:26.176 --> 05:31.802
Now I'll tell you what we could do right out here alongside the trail while we're taking it easy and kind of lazy like.

05:32.743 --> 05:34.945
I want you to do something, friends.

05:34.965 --> 05:36.867
Press your hand right here on the ground.

05:38.108 --> 05:43.313
Isn't the ground soft and kind of spongy under these trees when you press your hand down on it like that?

05:44.194 --> 05:54.544
Well, sir, that's because there are leaves and needles on top and just under it, more leaves and needles in various stages of decay until it goes back to the rich, poorest soil.

05:55.469 --> 06:01.537
Now, when rain hits soil like this or snow melts on top of it, the water kind of settles into it.

06:01.557 --> 06:07.265
Some of it is absorbed and stored for gradual release to the streams and lakes.

06:07.285 --> 06:10.069
Now, on the other hand, take that bare spot over there.

06:10.089 --> 06:13.293
I'm sure you know what's going to happen when rain hits that spot.

06:13.313 --> 06:15.216
There's nothing to absorb the raindrops.

06:15.236 --> 06:20.042
They just rush off bare land like they do the paved streets and sidewalks in the city.

06:21.136 --> 06:28.967
Now, if you get a heavy rain on land that's not protected by trees or grass or brush, why, you're bound to get erosion and even floods.

06:30.268 --> 06:34.514
I think this is something that everybody ought to be interested in.

06:34.534 --> 06:38.960
It helps you appreciate the value of water and where it comes from.

06:38.980 --> 06:42.505
Now, the sons of the pioneers there, they know the value of water, I'll bet.

06:42.885 --> 06:43.786
How about it, Lloyd?

06:44.287 --> 06:48.152
Well, sir, the boys and me, we sure do know the value of water.

06:48.693 --> 06:50.215
We've learned it the hard way, Billy.

06:50.600 --> 06:55.246
Out in the mountains or on the range when everything was dry as dust.

06:55.266 --> 06:57.508
No rain for long, long weeks.

06:57.969 --> 07:08.822
Why, we've known times when we'd crawl down to any little old water hole and sop up the mud and what little water was there and wring it through our kerchiefs to get those few precious drops.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.566
Yes, we know the value of water, all right.

07:13.207 --> 07:14.869
Water, water, water.

07:16.520 --> 07:26.235
All day I've faced the barren ways without the taste of water.

07:26.255 --> 07:28.138
Cool water.

07:28.438 --> 07:37.272
Old Ann and I, that's what we're trying for.

07:37.372 --> 07:39.916
Water.

07:41.598 --> 07:45.244
Cool, clear water.

07:48.481 --> 07:51.345
Don't you listen to him, Dan.

07:51.365 --> 07:52.987
He's a devil, not a man.

07:53.187 --> 07:57.353
And he spreads the burning sand with water.

07:57.373 --> 08:07.766
Dan, can you see that big green tree where the water's running free and it's waiting there for me and you?

08:08.767 --> 08:13.193
The nights are cool and I'm a fool.

08:13.213 --> 08:16.918
Each time's a pool of water.

08:17.978 --> 08:37.506
But with the dawn I'll waken yon and carry on to water, cool, clear water.

08:42.532 --> 09:12.353
Then he's the devil out of man And he spreads the burning sand with water Then can you see that big green tree Where the water's running free And it's waiting there for me And you, water The shadows sway and seem to say Tonight we pray for water Ooh, water

09:13.109 --> 09:29.855
And way up there, he'll hear our prayer and joy.

09:31.357 --> 09:38.248
Water, water, clear water.

09:39.569 --> 09:46.976
You know, I never understood until you explained a while back to Lloyd just why you fellas put such feeling into that song.

09:48.157 --> 09:56.245
I guess it takes going without something, like water, to give you the inspiration to express yourself as you fellas do in that song.

09:57.686 --> 10:00.589
Well, look who's coming up the trail here big as life.

10:01.270 --> 10:04.853
It's Smokey Bear, a friend of all who love the forest.

10:04.873 --> 10:06.555
And he's got a special message for us.

10:07.902 --> 10:10.305
Hello there, folks.

10:10.325 --> 10:11.966
Do me a little favor, will you?

10:12.667 --> 10:24.220
Next time you turn on the faucet to get a drink of water or to fill a cooking pot or to take a bath, think a little bit about where that water comes from.

10:24.240 --> 10:33.370
Think about how it started in the forest as little drops of melting snow or as a spring or a little stream.

10:34.075 --> 10:41.545
Remember always that it takes a protective cover of grass or brush and trees to feed you the water you use.

10:42.466 --> 10:46.912
And that's why you've got to be careful with fire outdoors.

10:48.094 --> 10:50.817
Well, I'll be seeing you.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.422
And there he goes down the trail.

10:54.442 --> 10:55.363
Thank you, Smokey.

10:56.465 --> 10:58.067
Now, friends, just settle back.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.590
You're going to enjoy a mighty wonderful number.

11:00.651 --> 11:04.015
It's an Indian song, a favorite with the Sons of the Pioneer.

11:04.889 --> 11:06.985
It's called Blue Juniata.

11:12.702 --> 11:40.414
Wild roved an Indian maid, bright Alfarata, Where sweep the waters of the blue Juniata. Swift as an antelope through the forest goin' Loose were her jetty locks in wavy tresses flowin'. Wild roved an Indian maid, bright Alfarata

11:40.394 --> 11:46.168
Where sweep the waters of the blue Juniata.

11:47.812 --> 11:52.824
Gay was the mountain song of bright Alfarata.

11:53.406 --> 11:58.538
Where sweep the waters of the blue Juniata.

11:58.788 --> 12:03.616
Strong and true my arrows are in my painted quiver.

12:04.417 --> 12:09.886
Swift goes my light canoe, adown the rapid river.

12:10.086 --> 12:21.825
Wild roved an Indian maid, bright Alfarata, where sweep the waters of the blue Juniata.

12:22.835 --> 12:27.926
Bold is my warrior brave, the love of Alfarata.

12:28.427 --> 12:33.939
Proud waves his snowy plume along the Juniata.

12:33.959 --> 12:39.190
Soft and low he speaks to me, then his war cry soundin'.

12:39.170 --> 12:44.882
Rings his voice in thunder loud from height to height, resounding, bounding.

12:45.022 --> 12:56.506
Wild roved an Indian maid, bright Alfarata, where sweep the waters of the blue Juniata.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.909
Water.

12:57.929 --> 12:59.873
Water.

12:59.893 --> 13:00.013
Water.

13:06.372 --> 13:09.877
Well, friends, I guess it's time for you to be heading back down the trail.

13:10.718 --> 13:13.962
Certainly glad you could drop by for just a little while.

13:13.982 --> 13:23.514
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service and the station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:24.435 --> 13:29.422
Until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:29.442 --> 13:34.388
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:36.106 --> 13:45.595
Well, so long for now from Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and from those wonderful fellas who sing your favorite songs of the outdoors the way you like to hear them.

13:45.615 --> 13:47.176
The Sons of the Pioneers.

13:47.476 --> 13:55.764
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:56.465 --> 14:00.168
He can find a fire before he starts to flame.

14:00.528 --> 14:04.712
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:05.047 --> 14:13.223
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a'growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:13.944 --> 14:17.591
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:17.992 --> 14:22.019
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:22.560 --> 14:26.548
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:26.832 --> 14:30.637
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:31.238 --> 14:35.044
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:35.424 --> 14:39.390
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:39.991 --> 14:44.217
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:44.197 --> 14:57.430
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:57.430 --> 15:34.000
