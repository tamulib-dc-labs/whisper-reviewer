00:12.400 --> 00:24.374
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:24.755 --> 00:26.457
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:26.497 --> 00:28.219
That was how he got his name.

00:28.739 --> 00:29.560
Hi there, friends.

00:29.700 --> 00:30.702
I'm Billy Johnson.

00:30.742 --> 00:32.584
You're singing with me.

00:32.604 --> 00:34.907
Glad you could come this way up a trail again today.

00:35.447 --> 00:39.572
So how about having a seat beside me here on the log under the old pine trees?

00:40.497 --> 00:43.387
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:43.407 --> 00:47.140
That's cause we kept fires from running wild around here.

00:47.160 --> 00:52.819
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out again today for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:53.322 --> 00:57.227
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail.

00:57.387 --> 00:58.488
Sons of the Pioneers.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.891
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail, too.

01:01.492 --> 01:05.016
Now that you're here, let's start off this little outdoor get-together of ours.

01:05.056 --> 01:08.681
So just relax and let's hear some mighty fine singing, huh?

01:11.284 --> 01:15.229
Hold him down, burn his hide.

01:15.209 --> 01:21.837
There's extra pay for every day, so hold that critter down, burn his high, hold him down.

01:22.719 --> 01:26.684
It's round-up time and the weather's fine and the strays must all be branded.

01:27.044 --> 01:30.989
The irons try and the gogies try, but the old man has commanded.

01:31.009 --> 01:38.719
So all day long I sing this song, hold that critter down, hold him down, burn his high.

01:39.121 --> 01:45.771
There's extra pay for every day, so hold that critter down, burn his hide, holding down.

01:46.572 --> 01:50.317
I'll head for town when the boss comes round with the back pay that he owes me.

01:50.598 --> 01:54.423
Get drunk to sin with my old pal Jim and land where the bouncer throws me.

01:54.704 --> 02:02.395
Then bet him ten he can't do it again, so hold that critter down, holding down, burn his hide.

02:02.797 --> 02:09.446
There's extra pay for every day, so hold that critter down, burn his hide, hold him down.

02:10.227 --> 02:14.192
I'll be back next day with ten minutes' pay left from the check that I drew.

02:14.452 --> 02:18.658
The boss says, son, you're a son of a gun, but I wish that I was like you.

02:18.678 --> 02:22.142
So I'll burn hair for next month's hair and hold that critter down.

02:22.342 --> 02:25.707
Hold him down, burn his hide.

02:26.588 --> 02:32.736
There's extra pay for every day, so hold that critter down, burn his hide, hold him down.

02:33.982 --> 02:44.272
Hold that critter down.

02:44.292 --> 02:49.336
The boys roll that song just about as fast as a fire runs wild through the forest or woods.

02:50.357 --> 02:53.580
Now there's one critter we all ought to lend a hand and hold him down.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.183
Wildfire.

02:56.203 --> 03:00.787
Someone once said, to stage a forest fire you need only a few things.

03:01.348 --> 03:01.828
A forest,

03:02.467 --> 03:09.434
the right atmospheric conditions, and a spark, either from a lightning bolt or a match in the hands of a fool or a knave.

03:10.355 --> 03:11.376
The formula is simple.

03:12.116 --> 03:17.021
The wonder is that we do not have more and bigger fires.

03:17.041 --> 03:28.212
Well, sir, when you consider we still have in the neighborhood of 190,000 forest and wood fires in this country every year, I think you'll agree that's too many.

03:28.232 --> 03:32.136
And whether they're big or small, the damage they do to our timber resources

03:33.078 --> 03:34.620
Well, sir, it's a crying shame.

03:35.501 --> 03:44.733
Because when trees burn, it's not only lumber that goes up in smoke, it's part of the very strength and security of our nation.

03:44.753 --> 03:53.104
When these trees burn, it's the same as burning up money and jobs, and the very foundation of homes and communities.

03:53.124 --> 04:02.697
I want to tell you some more about this, but I see the sons of the pioneers have their hearts set on the beauty of Oklahoma, the state of rolling plains and heavily wooded mountains.

04:03.183 --> 04:03.984
Go ahead, boys.

04:11.618 --> 04:22.677
The everlasting hills of Oklahoma They hold a million treasures to be found

04:26.538 --> 04:51.027
Golden grain on hills of green Wave to valleys, cool and clean Too bad some foes have never teemed The everlasting hills of Oklahoma

04:58.955 --> 05:19.073
The everlasting tales of Oklahoma Are told in clouded statues in the sky Pioneers who long have gone

05:19.306 --> 05:38.175
Their wagon wheels still rumble on when thunder feels and falls upon the everlasting hills of Oklahoma.

05:46.627 --> 05:59.567
The everlasting fame of Oklahoma will live in names of men she claims her own.

06:00.728 --> 06:13.748
Some were right and some were wrong in history's pages, frozen songs.

06:13.947 --> 06:30.488
Oh, hail them now, for they all belong to the everlasting hymn of all.

06:44.474 --> 06:47.919
Well, sir, I'm sure the folks in Oklahoma are mighty proud of that, too.

06:49.061 --> 06:53.168
You know, friends, it really doesn't matter who you are or where you live.

06:53.849 --> 06:57.815
When trees burn, it affects you in one way or another.

06:57.835 --> 07:05.026
Supposing you're a farmer in Kansas or a railroad worker in Seattle or a housewife in Brooklyn.

07:05.047 --> 07:09.514
What does a forest fire burning, say, in Oregon or Mississippi have to do with you?

07:10.435 --> 07:12.338
The answer, my friend, is plenty.

07:13.212 --> 07:14.774
Just think about your own home.

07:14.794 --> 07:16.296
You're mighty proud of it, I know.

07:16.896 --> 07:21.322
And you've spent a lot of money to make it attractive and livable.

07:21.342 --> 07:24.105
But what's helped to make it so?

07:24.125 --> 07:26.869
Wood in all its forms.

07:26.889 --> 07:32.535
Wood from the very forests, perhaps, that are blazing in Oregon or Mississippi.

07:32.556 --> 07:34.478
Oh, we're all in this, all right.

07:34.498 --> 07:35.719
Every one of us.

07:35.739 --> 07:37.882
Whoever we are, wherever we live.

07:38.943 --> 07:42.848
Whether it's in Colorado or Michigan or in Virginia...

07:43.216 --> 08:12.227
In the blue-red mountains of Virginia On the trail of the lonesome pine In the pale moonshine Our hearts entwined Where she carved a name And I carved mine, oh, June Like the mountains, I'm blue Like the pine I am lonesome for you In the blue-red mountains of Virginia

08:12.629 --> 08:16.114
On the trail of the lonesome pine.

08:16.154 --> 08:21.021
Oh, Jew, like the mountains, I'm blue.

08:21.742 --> 08:27.471
Like the pine, I am lonesome for you.

08:27.491 --> 08:30.355
In the blue rich mountains of Virginia.

08:31.476 --> 08:37.565
On the trail of the lonesome pine.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.189
You know, talking about pine trees in Virginia...

08:40.422 --> 08:44.025
All through the south and pretty much everywhere the trees grow.

08:44.726 --> 08:47.669
Do you know what suffers most when the forest or woods burns?

08:48.649 --> 08:53.013
It's the little trees just getting started in life.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.076
Next time you're out in the woods, search out those little fellas.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.678
Seedlings, we call them.

08:58.498 --> 09:01.861
You'll find them hidden in the grass if you look real close.

09:01.881 --> 09:08.067
Now those are the little trees that will grow into our future supply of timber if they're just given the chance.

09:08.772 --> 09:11.636
You see, it doesn't take a big fire to kill those little trees.

09:12.597 --> 09:20.909
The ground fires of the east and south, usually not very dramatic fires, do terrible damage to the seedlings.

09:20.929 --> 09:26.737
Why, it picks them off as clean as you do a platter of tender southern fried chicken.

09:26.757 --> 09:35.890
But seriously, friends, forest and woods fires, no matter how big or how small they are, give our timber resources an awful beat.

09:35.910 --> 09:38.053
We've just got to keep them from getting started.

09:38.725 --> 09:39.806
Don't you agree, Lloyd?

09:40.166 --> 09:42.269
We've seen those things, Billy, close up.

09:42.889 --> 09:47.013
We've had a full dose of fighting forest fires, the boys and myself.

09:47.574 --> 09:50.837
And if we never have to fight another one, it'll be too soon.

09:51.718 --> 10:04.851
You know, if folks could just realize the sweat and back-breaking work and heartbreak, too, that goes with forest fire fighting, I'm sure they'd be careful with fire every time they use it outdoors.

10:05.607 --> 10:26.460
If they had to walk through a burned forest and see for themselves the awful damage that wildfire does, well, let's sing a song, boys.

10:26.480 --> 10:31.648
Oh, sun goes down, work's all done.

10:31.966 --> 10:35.371
Evens here at last.

10:35.812 --> 10:39.738
Moon comes up behind the hills I love.

10:40.519 --> 10:46.367
And I'm ridin' home.

10:47.369 --> 10:51.936
See that lonesome now.

10:51.956 --> 10:58.265
I'm down that lonesome trail.

10:58.285 --> 10:59.106
I'm down the trail.

10:59.126 --> 10:59.627
I'm down the trail.

11:12.213 --> 11:16.418
Sit down, doggies, rest a while.

11:16.979 --> 11:20.423
I'll be back tomorrow morn.

11:21.184 --> 11:24.949
And take you down to where the water's cool.

11:25.630 --> 11:32.859
But now I'm ridin' home.

11:32.879 --> 11:36.884
See that lonesome down.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.406
I'm down that lonesome down the trail.

11:41.120 --> 11:57.282
He's riding home.

12:07.497 --> 12:08.578
He's riding home.

12:09.723 --> 12:16.410
And coming our way up the trail is Smokey Bear, big as life with a special message for me.

12:16.430 --> 12:18.372
Hello there, folks.

12:19.293 --> 12:20.734
Here's something to think about.

12:21.755 --> 12:27.581
Somewhere in this country, day in and day out, a forest or woodland is on fire.

12:28.202 --> 12:28.722
That's right.

12:29.183 --> 12:34.168
There's an average of 500 forest fires every day in the United States.

12:34.989 --> 12:39.173
In a year's time, these fires destroy enough saw timber trees

12:39.355 --> 12:53.596
to build 86,000 five-room houses, enough pulp-sized trees each year to supply newsprint to every newspaper in the country for 12 months, and millions of little trees.

12:53.957 --> 12:58.143
Tomorrow's timber go up in flames at the same time.

12:58.163 --> 13:00.907
So please be careful.

13:00.927 --> 13:06.375
Remember, only you can prevent forests and wood fires.

13:06.811 --> 13:09.575
Well, I'll be seen.

13:10.756 --> 13:12.598
And there he goes down the trail.

13:13.279 --> 13:14.221
Thank you, Smokey.

13:15.402 --> 13:25.175
Friends, you know it's your own state forestry department along with the United States Forest Service and this station you're listening to that makes these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:25.936 --> 13:29.881
Until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:30.542 --> 13:35.468
Remember, only we, you and I, can't prevent forest and woods fires.

13:36.393 --> 13:41.881
Well, so long for now from Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and the Sons of the Pioneers.

13:41.901 --> 13:50.713
Smokey the Fair, Smokey the Fair, growlin' and a-growlin' and a-slippin' the air.

13:50.733 --> 13:54.558
He can find a fire before he starts to flame.

13:54.939 --> 13:58.965
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

13:59.545 --> 14:03.531
Smokey the Fair, Smokey the Fair.

14:03.680 --> 14:07.627
Rowling and the growling and the sniffing the air.

14:08.288 --> 14:11.974
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.218
That's why they call him Smokey.

14:14.238 --> 14:16.361
That was how he got his name.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.825
Smokey the Bear.

14:19.106 --> 14:20.929
Smokey the Bear.

14:21.213 --> 14:50.713
Crowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear Crowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name
