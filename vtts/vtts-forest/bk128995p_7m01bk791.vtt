00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
[Silence.]

00:14.000 --> 00:21.305
Timber! Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:21.305 --> 00:31.325
[Music.]

00:31.325 --> 00:39.938
Today we present the third program in our series on forest conservation, featuring Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:39.958 --> 00:45.866
Our scene is Beaver Dam Forest, lying green and peaceful under the hot mid-morning sun.

00:45.886 --> 00:48.330
But to the south, great black clouds have been gathering,

00:48.547 --> 00:52.713
And right now we're starting to roll faster and faster toward Beaver Dam Forest.

00:52.733 --> 00:58.301
If Ranger Bill had known this, he probably wouldn't have brought his three young companions into the forest this day.

00:58.321 --> 01:00.344
As matters stand, here they are.

01:00.364 --> 01:08.015
Ranger Bill, his niece June, their two young friends, Joe and Sam, on the west bank of the rapidly flowing Big Creek.

01:08.035 --> 01:12.241
High above towers the great concrete dam of Beaver Dam Lake.

01:12.262 --> 01:16.748
As the four look up at the imposing man-made structure, June shivers ever so slightly.

01:17.183 --> 01:19.086
Her action doesn't escape Ranger Bill.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.450
He gently places his hand on the girl's shoulder.

01:21.911 --> 01:23.012
Something bothering you, June?

01:23.313 --> 01:27.059
I was just thinking how awful it would be if that dam should suddenly give way.

01:27.259 --> 01:28.261
Hey, that's an idea.

01:28.821 --> 01:31.746
And with us standing right here below it, holy mackerel.

01:31.766 --> 01:32.668
Take it easy, Joe.

01:32.708 --> 01:33.589
You too, Jane.

01:34.075 --> 01:37.461
I don't want you to think that there's much danger in that dam busting loose just like that.

01:37.481 --> 01:39.725
But dams do break sometimes, don't they, Ranger Bill?

01:39.825 --> 01:40.727
Yes, Sam, they do.

01:41.047 --> 01:45.215
Sometimes, in spite of all the care and skill that they're built with, dams do give way.

01:45.295 --> 01:46.277
How come, Ranger Bill?

01:46.357 --> 01:49.182
Well, there's one reason in particular that I want to tell you about, Joe.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.323
In a way, that's why we stopped off here on our way to the sawmill.

01:52.424 --> 01:54.066
I thought we were going swimming in the lake.

01:54.266 --> 01:55.287
Well, that too, Sam.

01:55.808 --> 01:56.929
I'm just hoping there'll be time.

01:57.149 --> 02:00.854
You're going to tell us about forests and water as you mentioned to me coming out here today.

02:00.874 --> 02:03.277
How forests and waters are related.

02:03.598 --> 02:04.499
Is that it, Uncle Bill?

02:04.619 --> 02:05.880
Yes, June, it is.

02:05.900 --> 02:06.361
Now, look, Joe.

02:06.441 --> 02:07.322
Yeah, Ranger Bill?

02:07.362 --> 02:09.405
I want you to dig down into the soil with your hands.

02:09.445 --> 02:10.186
You mean here?

02:10.346 --> 02:10.887
Yeah, that's right.

02:10.967 --> 02:11.768
Dig deep.

02:11.788 --> 02:12.088
Okay.

02:12.409 --> 02:14.291
Now, grab some of that rich dirt down there.

02:14.731 --> 02:15.352
Use both hands.

02:15.372 --> 02:16.013
Don't be afraid.

02:16.769 --> 02:21.116
Lift it all up with the leaves on top, just as it is on the forest floor, and don't shake it up.

02:22.058 --> 02:24.923
Okay, now what, Ranger Bill?

02:24.983 --> 02:30.352
Sam, suppose you fill your hands with that plain dirt and sand from this bare spot by the creek.

02:30.372 --> 02:31.354
Right, Ranger Bill.

02:31.374 --> 02:34.339
June, will you take this old hat of mine and dip it in a little water, will you?

02:34.505 --> 02:35.708
Hey, what gives, Ranger Bill?

02:36.289 --> 02:37.492
Oh, this poor hat.

02:37.512 --> 02:38.474
All right, Uncle Bill.

02:39.236 --> 02:40.158
Here's the water.

02:40.178 --> 02:42.924
Now pour some of that water on the plain dirt that Sam's got.

02:42.945 --> 02:43.466
Slowly now.

02:43.786 --> 02:44.588
That's it.

02:44.608 --> 02:44.789
Good.

02:45.190 --> 02:46.733
Hey, the water's running off this dirt.

02:47.094 --> 02:48.377
Right over the sides of my hands.

02:48.778 --> 02:50.322
And it's carrying a lot of the dirt with it.

02:50.462 --> 02:50.522
Oh.

02:50.502 --> 02:52.525
Look, it's just like mine.

02:52.545 --> 02:55.849
All right, June, now pour some of the water on that forest soil that Joe's holding.

02:56.330 --> 02:56.770
That's right.

02:56.911 --> 03:00.856
This water's gone down into this soil I've got, but nothing else is happening.

03:00.876 --> 03:01.997
Well, just give it time, Joe.

03:02.158 --> 03:05.983
Wait, I feel it now, but it's just a drop at a time.

03:06.003 --> 03:06.283
That's right.

03:06.303 --> 03:07.264
Not like Sam's at all.

03:07.405 --> 03:10.269
Yes, and the drops are clear, aren't they?

03:10.889 --> 03:14.815
All that's coming through the bottom of Joe's hands are those drops of clean water.

03:15.035 --> 03:16.877
All right, fellas, you can get rid of that stuff now.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.581
Now, this was just kind of a rough experiment.

03:20.101 --> 03:21.724
But tell me, does any of it make sense to you?

03:21.784 --> 03:22.565
Sure, Ranger Bill.

03:22.925 --> 03:28.835
That plain dirt I had from the bare spot can't take in water any better than, well, the sidewalk's back home.

03:29.235 --> 03:30.016
It runs right off.

03:30.597 --> 03:34.784
But the soil that Joe had from the forest floor works just like a sponge.

03:34.824 --> 03:35.846
That's just it, Sam.

03:36.386 --> 03:38.670
Good forest soil is like a sponge.

03:39.050 --> 03:43.197
You see, it holds the water it can take, and then it lets some of the extra water loose.

03:43.558 --> 03:44.539
But gradually...

03:44.840 --> 03:46.101
That's the whole thing in a nutshell.

03:47.222 --> 03:51.906
You see, that's why rainwater will run off an open field quicker than it'll run off a good forest floor.

03:52.847 --> 04:00.914
That's why forests are so important in protecting water supplies and keeping water clean and pure and in regulating the flow of streams like Big Creek here.

04:01.074 --> 04:06.199
A fellow doesn't realize when he drinks nice, clean water at home that he may have the forest to thank for it.

04:06.219 --> 04:08.921
Well, more than drinking water alone comes out of the forest, Sam.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.083
What about irrigation water?

04:11.103 --> 04:13.345
You know, that's mighty important to folks in the dry country.

04:13.814 --> 04:17.783
and water for power and for the streams and lakes that give all of us so much fun and sport.

04:18.465 --> 04:26.243
Now, that dam up there provides a double use of forest water, you see, for power and for recreation, you know, for camping and picnicking and the like.

04:26.623 --> 04:29.089
Oh, then that building near the dam, across the creek,

04:29.390 --> 04:32.254
Is that the powerhouse, Uncle Bill, where they generate electricity?

04:32.294 --> 04:33.356
Yes, June, it is.

04:33.376 --> 04:36.922
And the recreation area is opposite the powerhouse on our side of the lake.

04:37.202 --> 04:38.524
Hey, that sounds like thunder.

04:38.744 --> 04:40.126
I'm afraid that's just what it is, Joe.

04:40.547 --> 04:44.053
Well, well, well, look at those clouds beginning to boil up from the south over the dam, will you?

04:44.573 --> 04:48.139
You know, it might be a bad storm coming up, but nothing for us to get excited about.

04:48.299 --> 04:51.244
Why, the sky was so blue and clear just a few minutes ago.

04:51.284 --> 04:53.507
It doesn't take long for a storm to come up sometimes.

04:53.639 --> 04:55.803
I reckon we had better be moving along, though.

04:55.823 --> 04:58.227
Oh, gee whiz, now there goes our swim in the lake.

04:58.367 --> 04:59.710
Holy cow, it's starting to rain.

04:59.930 --> 05:01.032
Where we go, Ranger Bill?

05:01.132 --> 05:05.059
Let's see, we can't make it across Big Creek to the powerhouse, and it's too far to the road to our car.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.143
Same thing goes for that picnic shelter up on the lake.

05:07.584 --> 05:08.245
I've got it.

05:08.265 --> 05:09.748
Come on and watch your step, all of you.

05:10.008 --> 05:12.132
Boy, oh boy, he's really coming down now.

05:12.192 --> 05:13.234
Where we going, Ranger Bill?

05:13.534 --> 05:16.239
There's a big cave down the creek a ways, a big old bear den.

05:16.259 --> 05:17.722
Hot dog, this is the life.

05:17.842 --> 05:17.942
Whoa.

05:17.922 --> 05:19.724
What are you carrying in that knapsack, June?

05:20.205 --> 05:21.346
My swimsuit and rope.

05:21.447 --> 05:22.208
I'll carry it, June.

05:22.608 --> 05:23.249
That's it.

05:23.269 --> 05:23.689
Give it here.

05:23.810 --> 05:24.691
We're almost there now.

05:24.871 --> 05:26.633
Did you say it was a bear den, Uncle Bill?

05:26.653 --> 05:27.775
Yes, but don't worry, June.

05:27.855 --> 05:29.257
I don't think the bears use it anymore.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.659
Rain, rain, go away.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.120
Come again some other day.

05:32.321 --> 05:32.962
Ah, here we are.

05:33.182 --> 05:34.604
Now duck your heads and get in quick.

05:34.624 --> 05:35.244
You first, June.

05:35.505 --> 05:36.266
That's the girl.

05:36.286 --> 05:36.847
You next, Sam.

05:36.867 --> 05:37.127
Go on.

05:37.147 --> 05:39.089
Doesn't look like much of a cave to me, Ranger Bill.

05:39.109 --> 05:39.951
It gets bigger inside.

05:39.971 --> 05:40.812
Get going now.

05:40.832 --> 05:41.372
Now you, June.

05:41.473 --> 05:42.013
Roger.

05:42.033 --> 05:42.894
Hurry, Uncle Bill.

05:43.095 --> 05:44.316
It's awful dark in here.

05:44.376 --> 05:45.117
I'm coming, June.

05:45.298 --> 05:47.220
Gee, it's dry anyway.

05:47.200 --> 05:50.005
Doggone, this flashlight of mine, I can hardly see with it.

05:50.425 --> 05:52.569
Yeah, well, we don't mind the dark, Ranger Bill.

05:52.689 --> 05:54.572
No, we don't mind the dark, much.

05:54.592 --> 05:55.073
Ranger Bill?

05:55.354 --> 05:56.375
Yes, Sam?

05:56.395 --> 05:59.721
I was just thinking about what June said, about the dam breaking, maybe.

06:00.121 --> 06:01.163
We're still right below it.

06:01.243 --> 06:02.065
Quiet, Sam.

06:02.085 --> 06:03.207
No, no, no, that's all right, Joe.

06:03.727 --> 06:06.111
I don't want you youngsters worrying about Beaver Dam going out.

06:06.171 --> 06:06.893
I'm certainly not.

06:08.936 --> 06:13.123
But this is a mighty bad storm, and I'm wondering about what's happening south of here, at Rockville.

06:13.576 --> 06:16.660
I'm wondering how that dam above Rockville at the reservoir is taking this storm.

06:16.700 --> 06:17.321
I know the town.

06:17.541 --> 06:18.822
It's outside Beaver Dam Forest.

06:18.842 --> 06:19.183
That's right.

06:19.263 --> 06:20.524
Why are you worried about it, Ranger Bill?

06:20.584 --> 06:24.089
Well, there's been a lot of timber cutting going on around Rockville in recent years, Joe.

06:24.109 --> 06:25.590
Well, what's wrong with that, Ranger Bill?

06:26.211 --> 06:29.515
People need houses and other things made out of wood these days.

06:29.535 --> 06:32.499
And you said yourself that forests should be cut to provide that wood.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.141
Sure, Sam, I did.

06:34.161 --> 06:39.347
But you see, a great deal of this logging at Rockville has been taking place on the private land that's in the town watershed.

06:39.901 --> 06:43.747
And that's one place where there's more reason for careful cutting than in almost anywhere else.

06:44.328 --> 06:46.451
You see, it's not been selective logging by any means.

06:46.512 --> 06:47.433
I've got it, Ranger Bill.

06:48.014 --> 06:51.479
Those folks have gone out overboard and been cutting the trees and the watershed.

06:51.580 --> 06:51.880
Mm-hmm.

06:51.900 --> 06:56.608
And that's taken away some of the power of the land to hold and let go of the water gradually, as you showed us.

06:56.868 --> 06:57.589
Right, Ranger Bill?

06:57.729 --> 06:59.112
Yes, Joe, that's it.

06:59.132 --> 07:00.534
What's happening at Rockville is this.

07:01.315 --> 07:03.959
With so many trees gone, the soil has started to wear away.

07:04.580 --> 07:05.622
Now, we call that erosion.

07:06.293 --> 07:10.082
Well, every rainfall makes a big dent in the heavily logged sections of that watershed.

07:10.743 --> 07:16.377
The water comes down, and it hits the bare ground solid wherever there's no trees or brush to hold it back.

07:16.397 --> 07:24.235
Gathers up all the loose leaves, loosens more and more soil each time, and takes every shortcut it can along the logging roads and places where the logs were pulled out.

07:24.670 --> 07:30.859
And it plunges down carrying soil, sticks, rocks, everything it can move, all down into the town reservoir.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.425
Well, doesn't the reservoir fill up with all that stuff then, Ranger Bill?

07:34.445 --> 07:37.349
Well, that's exactly what's happening at Rockville, Sam.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.953
The silt, as we call it, has been piling up in the reservoir.

07:40.434 --> 07:43.118
Some of the town folks know that the trouble has been building up for them.

07:43.469 --> 07:45.994
but there isn't very much that they can do about it.

07:46.014 --> 07:50.964
You see, as I said, the worst logging has been going on in those parts of the watershed that the town doesn't own.

07:50.984 --> 07:52.587
What's going to happen there, Ranger Bill?

07:52.767 --> 07:58.900
Well, Joe, I'm afraid it won't take many storms like this one to bring Rockville River to a dangerous flood condition.

07:58.920 --> 08:05.713
You see, with all that pressure of mud and silt, plus the usual flow of water, plus the extra water that a storm like this brings down...

08:06.217 --> 08:09.080
Well, the dam might not stand up under it all.

08:09.300 --> 08:12.664
Gee, and if the dam goes, the town will be flooded.

08:12.684 --> 08:14.045
That's just what I'm afraid of, Joe.

08:14.446 --> 08:16.648
Well, gosh, now I feel better about Beaver Dam.

08:17.189 --> 08:18.730
Nothing like that's been happening here.

08:19.091 --> 08:20.772
Water is a precious thing, Sam.

08:21.473 --> 08:25.097
It's worth giving the forest watershed every bit of care and protection possible.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.240
Say, June, you haven't said a word for some time.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.381
What's the matter, young lady?

08:29.401 --> 08:32.865
Oh, I've been listening, Uncle Bill, but... Uh-oh.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.523
Well, I'm awful, uncomfortable in these wet clothes.

08:37.305 --> 08:38.286
This looks bad, June.

08:38.306 --> 08:39.868
You better go to the back of the cave.

08:40.148 --> 08:43.532
Just take off that wet shirt you've got on and get into that dry robe of yours.

08:43.552 --> 08:44.553
You should have thought of this sooner.

08:44.813 --> 08:46.135
Go on now.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.017
Here's your knapsack, June.

08:48.037 --> 08:48.718
Thanks, Joe.

08:48.998 --> 08:51.421
Now, don't you go out and leave me alone in this cave.

08:51.521 --> 08:52.142
We won't, June.

08:52.162 --> 08:52.542
Don't worry.

08:52.983 --> 08:56.827
Gosh, to get back to Rockville Dam, that can be bad business, eh, Ranger Bill?

08:57.007 --> 08:59.410
A lot more serious than those townspeople realize it.

08:59.862 --> 09:04.610
As soon as we can get out of here and back to the car, I want to check with the ranger station about this storm at Rockville.

09:04.630 --> 09:06.372
Going to use your shortwave radio ranger, Bill?

09:06.473 --> 09:07.134
That's right, Sam.

09:07.514 --> 09:10.519
You see, I make it a point to call in every once in a while when I'm out like this.

09:10.840 --> 09:11.721
Uncle Bill!

09:11.741 --> 09:12.623
Uncle Bill!

09:12.643 --> 09:13.524
Something's happened to June.

09:13.644 --> 09:14.285
I'm coming, June.

09:14.646 --> 09:15.407
Stay here, fellas.

09:15.978 --> 09:17.259
June, where are you?

09:17.279 --> 09:18.241
What's the matter?

09:18.261 --> 09:20.863
Oh, Uncle Bill, there's some kind of animal in here.

09:21.304 --> 09:26.550
I was getting into my robe when my foot hit something soft and it growled and I fell down.

09:27.070 --> 09:28.392
Oh, I guess I screamed.

09:28.672 --> 09:29.433
I got to my feet.

09:29.793 --> 09:30.875
Stand perfectly still, June.

09:31.095 --> 09:32.136
Let's find out what's in here.

09:32.256 --> 09:34.198
Oh, it can't be very big, Uncle Bill.

09:34.218 --> 09:35.540
It didn't bite me or anything.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.101
Hey, what goes on back there?

09:37.122 --> 09:37.922
It's all right, fellas.

09:37.962 --> 09:38.843
Come on in if you want to.

09:40.345 --> 09:40.585
Uh-huh.

09:41.346 --> 09:42.087
There you are.

09:42.539 --> 09:44.042
Over against the wall, huh, fella?

09:44.203 --> 09:45.104
What is it, Uncle Bill?

09:45.365 --> 09:46.067
I can't tell.

09:46.387 --> 09:46.908
Do you know?

09:47.409 --> 09:48.011
Yes, indeed.

09:48.472 --> 09:49.654
Now, let me have that wet shirt, June.

09:49.835 --> 09:50.516
Yes, Uncle Bill.

09:50.576 --> 09:50.957
Here it is.

09:51.197 --> 09:51.438
Thanks.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.082
I wish I could see better in here.

09:53.262 --> 09:54.144
What happened, Ranger Bill?

09:54.164 --> 09:54.685
Where's June?

09:54.845 --> 09:56.629
There's some kind of animal in here, Sam.

09:56.709 --> 09:57.511
I fell over in.

09:57.531 --> 09:57.972
Wow.

09:58.072 --> 09:59.134
Quiet now, all of you.

09:59.154 --> 10:03.163
I just want to drop this shirt on the little fella.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.492
Oh, careful, Uncle Bill.

10:05.512 --> 10:06.694
I've got him.

10:06.734 --> 10:07.696
Strong little rascal.

10:07.716 --> 10:08.718
What is it, Ranger Bill?

10:08.738 --> 10:10.020
It's just a little bear cub, Sam.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.423
Oh, boy, a bear cub.

10:11.443 --> 10:13.045
Let's take him outside where we can look at him.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.271
I don't think this little fellow wants to get out into that storm any more than we do.

10:16.391 --> 10:18.415
Well, it was beginning to let up when we came back here.

10:18.495 --> 10:18.816
Oh, good.

10:18.876 --> 10:19.777
Let's go outside, then.

10:20.839 --> 10:21.701
Uh-huh.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.464
I believe the storm has gone past us.

10:23.849 --> 10:25.031
Yes, it's clear outside.

10:25.111 --> 10:26.072
Then what are we waiting for?

10:26.473 --> 10:27.214
Let's get out of here.

10:27.734 --> 10:28.455
You first, June.

10:28.515 --> 10:29.937
That suits me just fine.

10:30.719 --> 10:33.382
Who said that bears don't use this old cave anymore?

10:33.402 --> 10:39.050
If it weren't for everything being so wet, you'd never know that we had a bad storm at all.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.753
Yes, the sun's out again.

10:41.634 --> 10:42.875
Oh, look, Uncle Bill.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.420
One of the bears' little leg is sticking out of the lumberjack shirt.

10:46.921 --> 10:48.083
It's sort of odd, isn't it?

10:48.443 --> 10:49.785
Should it be bent back that way?

10:50.146 --> 10:50.666
No, June.

10:51.347 --> 10:53.350
Looks like this little fellow's got a broken leg.

10:53.785 --> 10:55.228
That's why he holed up in this cave.

10:55.729 --> 10:57.533
You know, I'll bet he was more scared than you were.

10:57.914 --> 10:58.816
Oh, poor fellow.

10:59.137 --> 11:01.742
I think we'll just take this cub over to the wildlife preserve.

11:02.324 --> 11:03.907
Our game warden will fix him up fine.

11:04.549 --> 11:06.212
Now, here, let me get this thing off your head, fella.

11:06.673 --> 11:08.076
Easy does it.

11:08.116 --> 11:09.520
No, no, no, no one's going to hurt you.

11:09.540 --> 11:10.923
Oh, isn't he pretty?

11:11.063 --> 11:12.486
Oh, let's give him a name.

11:12.466 --> 11:13.227
I know.

11:13.528 --> 11:14.649
We'll call him Smokey.

11:14.669 --> 11:15.430
Smokey?

11:15.450 --> 11:16.732
What kind of a name is that?

11:16.752 --> 11:20.778
That's the name of the bear on those forest fire prevention posters at the ranger station.

11:21.198 --> 11:23.562
And this bear looks exactly like that bear.

11:23.582 --> 11:24.563
So why not call him?

11:24.583 --> 11:25.585
Okay, Smokey it is then.

11:25.605 --> 11:25.905
Fine.

11:26.646 --> 11:29.510
But now I want to get back to that car and report to the station.

11:29.530 --> 11:31.273
Think you can make it in that robe you've got on, June?

11:31.493 --> 11:32.154
Sure, Uncle Bill.

11:32.174 --> 11:32.735
I'm all right.

11:32.835 --> 11:34.918
Let me carry a Smokey, will you, Ranger Bill?

11:35.439 --> 11:36.200
There you are, Joe.

11:36.220 --> 11:36.821
Be careful, though.

11:37.121 --> 11:37.642
Don't drop him.

11:38.022 --> 11:38.303
Okay.

11:38.323 --> 11:38.423
Okay.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.854
SP-7 to M-5.

11:50.455 --> 11:51.757
SP-7 to M-5.

11:52.238 --> 11:54.921
Ranger Scott calling Beaver Dam Ranger Station.

11:54.942 --> 11:55.743
Come in, M-5.

11:56.664 --> 11:57.725
No answer, Ranger, Phil.

11:58.126 --> 12:00.630
Wait, wait, they're coming on now.

12:00.650 --> 12:02.092
M-5, back to SP-7.

12:02.733 --> 12:04.435
Golly, we glad to hear from you, Ranger.

12:04.836 --> 12:06.598
There's all kinds of trouble at Rockville.

12:06.758 --> 12:09.282
The dam's gone and the town's under 10 feet of water.

12:09.302 --> 12:10.544
They need all the help they can get.

12:10.864 --> 12:11.065
Over.

12:11.485 --> 12:12.366
Just what I was afraid of.

12:13.188 --> 12:14.590
SP-7, back to M-5.

12:15.150 --> 12:16.332
Okay, Mac, we're on our way.

12:16.773 --> 12:17.674
SP-7 off.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.080
I'll tell him you're coming.

12:19.100 --> 12:19.821
M5 off.

12:19.981 --> 12:22.225
Ranger Bill, did you say we're on our way?

12:22.385 --> 12:23.527
Does that mean we can go, too?

12:23.707 --> 12:24.468
Yes, Joe, it does.

12:24.589 --> 12:25.891
Unless I miss my guests there.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.975
A lot of those folks at Rockville will be needing lumber for temporary shelter.

12:29.456 --> 12:33.563
The sawmill is right in the path of the flood, and I'm sure that you, Sam, and I can really help out there.

12:33.643 --> 12:34.985
Gee, we'll be glad, Ranger Bill.

12:35.005 --> 12:35.606
What about me, Uncle Bill?

12:35.866 --> 12:36.828
Can't I go, too?

12:37.168 --> 12:39.211
I'm afraid not, June.

12:39.472 --> 12:41.034
Looks like you're getting a cold, young lady.

12:41.735 --> 12:45.501
I think we'll just drop you and Smokey off at the game warden's house on our way back to Rockville.

12:46.055 --> 12:46.816
All right, everybody.

12:47.077 --> 12:48.499
Hop in the car and let's get going.

13:02.081 --> 13:11.556
All right.

13:18.758 --> 13:22.263
Well, that's a bit of adventure Joe and Sam didn't figure on.

13:23.124 --> 13:29.974
But I know they'll be doing a good job when we join them once again in next week's story about singing saws.

13:31.316 --> 13:39.367
Bill Scott, forest ranger, comes to you with the cooperation of the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture.

13:39.387 --> 13:44.334
Bill Scott is written by Bill Bergoffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokhahne.

13:46.457 --> 13:48.360
Your announcer is Bob Geist.

13:50.452 --> 14:07.266
