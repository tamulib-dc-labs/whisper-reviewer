00:20.097 --> 00:32.650
He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name Hi there friends, I'm Billy Johnson, you're singing with me

00:32.650 --> 00:35.133
Glad you could come this way up the trail again today.

00:35.193 --> 00:40.621
So how about having the same old seat here beside me, here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:41.282 --> 00:43.124
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:43.825 --> 00:46.569
That's cause we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:47.470 --> 00:51.936
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:52.296 --> 00:57.744
Of course, when I say we, I'm including those fellas just across the trail there, the sons of the pioneers.

00:57.764 --> 01:02.590
They've been waiting for you to come up the trail too, and now that you're here and comfortably settled...

01:02.823 --> 01:09.472
They're going to start off this little outdoor get-together of ours, so just relax and let's hear some mighty fine singing, huh?

01:13.258 --> 01:32.425
See them tumbling down Pledging their love to the ground Lonely but free I'll be found

01:32.793 --> 02:00.488
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds. I'm a lonely cowboy riding all day long. Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song.

02:06.273 --> 02:18.369
Nights underneath the prairie moon, I ride alone and sing a tune.

02:19.390 --> 02:30.525
See them tumbling down, pledging their love to the ground.

02:33.509 --> 02:57.964
Lonely but free I'll be found drifting along with the tumbling, tumbled weeds. Cares of the past are behind. Nowhere to go but I'll find

02:58.822 --> 03:20.374
just where the trail will wind, drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds. I know when night has gone, let anew...at dawn.

03:28.252 --> 03:48.808
I'll keep crawling along, deep in my heart is a song, here on the range I belong, drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

03:56.247 --> 04:00.772
That song, Tumbling Tumbleweed, is a classic among range songs, isn't it?

04:01.913 --> 04:09.441
Talking about the range, friends, have you ever stopped to think how important the range lands are to the economy of our nation?

04:09.461 --> 04:17.749
In the West especially, the whole agricultural economy is based largely on irrigation and livestock production.

04:17.769 --> 04:19.611
And the range plays a big part in both.

04:20.352 --> 04:23.115
Grazing lands not only provide food for the livestock,

04:23.737 --> 04:26.219
And the big game animals come into this, too, of course.

04:26.740 --> 04:30.543
But those lands are important water-yielding lands as well.

04:30.563 --> 04:34.767
Now, many of the Western Range areas are tied in pretty closely with the forests.

04:34.787 --> 04:39.331
And it's just as important to protect the range as it is the forest.

04:39.351 --> 04:41.773
Now, the sons of the pioneers know that, if anyone does.

04:41.853 --> 04:44.955
In fact, this talk of the range sort of has them going.

04:44.995 --> 04:46.797
So come on, boys, let's hear it.

04:50.820 --> 04:53.743
If you like a lot of room around to roam in,

04:54.230 --> 05:15.057
where any place you stop your hearts at home in, if you like to see a campfire in the goman, there's an open range ahead. If you like the sound of lazy cattle lowing 
where miles of sage and tumbleweeds are growing then it's time you knew the only place you're going is an open range ahead.

05:15.357 --> 05:41.432
Up in the sky keep the bright sun shining. Out of the west let a clean wind blow. Here in your heart there'll be no more pining for somewhere else to go. 
If you like to hear the prairie wind a-wailin' and watch the snowy clouds above us sailin' you can bet your life your heart will soon be trailin'

05:41.733 --> 06:09.225
To an open range ahead. Up in the sky keep a bright sun shining. Out of the west let a clean wind blow. Here in your hearts there'll be no more pining for somewhere else to go. 
If you like to hear the prairie wind a-wailin' And watch the snowy clouds above us sailin' You can bet your life your heart will soon be trailin'

06:09.425 --> 06:12.328
to an open range ahead.

06:12.949 --> 06:20.098
To an open range ahead.

06:20.899 --> 06:22.801
Yes, sir, open range ahead.

06:23.902 --> 06:26.465
Now, it's a little different in the East and the South.

06:27.266 --> 06:37.879
You don't have the big herds of cattle and the great bands of sheep, of course, that you do in the West, but just the same, grazing and livestock production are mighty important to the farmers.

06:38.872 --> 06:43.299
And you know, an interesting and very encouraging thing has been happening in recent years.

06:44.040 --> 06:51.952
For a long time in the East and South, livestock were just turned loose into the woods to scrape up as much grass and other food as they could get.

06:53.133 --> 07:01.125
Now, this didn't help the woods very much, especially where the hardwood trees grow, and it didn't help the livestock put on much weight either.

07:01.145 --> 07:06.313
Well, what's been happening is the farmers have been going more and more into regular pastures, and

07:06.563 --> 07:14.435
Their investment in building up those pastures is paying rich dividends and better livestock and better forestry.

07:14.455 --> 07:15.937
Now let's travel to the Midwest.

07:16.278 --> 07:25.572
You know, that's where the big feeding lots are, the livestock that have spent most of the time on the range and still need fattening up before they go to market.

07:25.592 --> 07:26.513
And that reminds me.

07:27.893 --> 07:32.624
I drove a herd of cattle down from old Nebraska way.

07:33.366 --> 07:37.595
That's how I'd come to be in the state of Iowa.

07:38.377 --> 07:40.602
I met a gal in Iowa.

07:40.783 --> 07:42.747
Her eyes were big and blue.

07:43.081 --> 07:47.387
I asked her what her name was, she said Sioux City Sue.

07:47.988 --> 07:52.313
Now Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue.

07:53.175 --> 07:55.478
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue.

07:55.998 --> 08:02.267
Swap a horse and dog for you, oh Sioux City Sue, Sioux City Sue.

08:02.908 --> 08:07.133
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue.

08:07.794 --> 08:12.160
Now I'm admitting I owe a lot to you.

08:12.477 --> 08:16.767
Cause I come from Nebraska to find Sioux City Sue.

08:17.389 --> 08:21.699
I'm gonna rope and tie her up, I'll use my old lasso.

08:22.301 --> 08:27.052
I'm gonna put my brand on my sweet Sioux City Sue.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.338
Oh, Sioux City Sue.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.864
Sioux City Sue.

08:31.884 --> 08:34.306
Your hair is red, your eyes are blue.

08:34.946 --> 08:37.228
Swap my horse and dog for you, oh.

08:37.449 --> 08:39.871
Sioux City Sue.

08:39.891 --> 08:41.372
Sioux City Sue.

08:41.752 --> 08:47.477
There ain't no gal as true as my sweet Sioux City Sue.

08:49.659 --> 08:50.260
Yes, sir.

08:51.240 --> 08:56.265
And now, friends, getting back to this business of the range and pastures and grass.

08:57.726 --> 08:58.887
Someone once wrote,

08:59.305 --> 09:11.638
He that can make two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before deserves good of mankind and does essential service to his country.

09:11.658 --> 09:20.186
The fellow who wrote that really knew what he was talking about because grass is much more than pretty green stuff growing on the range or in pastures.

09:20.206 --> 09:24.411
It's food for the table, meat and milk and other dairy products.

09:25.272 --> 09:27.574
It's leather for clothing and shoes and gloves.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.702
and it's jobs for thousands of people.

09:31.823 --> 09:37.550
It's the difference between thriving communities in many places or run-down towns.

09:37.570 --> 09:41.734
It's part of the backbone of America, part of her strength and security.

09:42.495 --> 09:51.484
That's what grass is, a wonderful resource worth looking after, worth protecting, especially against fire.

09:51.504 --> 09:54.928
I'll bet if anyone knows the value of good grass and good range,

09:55.347 --> 09:57.049
It's the sons of the pioneers.

09:57.550 --> 09:58.391
How about it, fellas?

09:58.791 --> 10:03.416
You can bet your life we know the value of the grass growing fresh and green.

10:04.197 --> 10:08.262
We've ridden through it sometimes when it's a high at touched or stirrups.

10:08.282 --> 10:09.323
Now, that's really something.

10:09.343 --> 10:14.209
When you're traveling good range, cattle nice and fat, plenty of food to go around.

10:15.030 --> 10:19.195
When we ride the range, Billy, here's a song we'd roll out over the grassy meadows.

10:22.685 --> 10:26.792
Trail Herd and Cowboy, hop on your pony, singin' ho.

10:26.872 --> 10:29.496
Healy-yay, healy-o.

10:29.516 --> 10:33.483
Start ridin' now, boy, we'll make San Antonio singin' ho.

10:33.583 --> 10:36.208
Healy-yay, healy-o.

10:36.308 --> 10:43.340
Long weary days and a dusty road to travel, but we'll make the boss pay for all this battle, drive and trattle.

10:43.360 --> 10:47.286
High, hard and carefree, Trail Herd and Cowboy singin' ho.

10:47.386 --> 10:48.388
Healy-yay, ho.

10:48.368 --> 11:00.575
Keep moving, doggies, time is a-wastin, singing ho, healy-yay, healy-o. I'm not impatient, but why don't you hasten singing ho, healy-yay, healy-o.

11:03.641 --> 11:06.748
You ought to know that a certain someone's waiting.

11:06.728 --> 11:13.901
You ought to know that to captivate and come to skate and arms will unfold, there's a trail herding cowboy singing ho, healy-yay, healy-o.

11:16.987 --> 11:21.555
One little gogie is straight from his mother singing ho, healy-yay, healy-o.

11:23.058 --> 11:29.530
Trail herding cowboy, there goes another singing ho, healy-yay, healy-o.

11:29.510 --> 11:33.976
Delio, follow the doggies through endless days of sunshine.

11:34.137 --> 11:37.942
When this drive is over, we'll take our fun time all at one time.

11:37.962 --> 11:43.870
Makes me a happy trail, herding cowboy singing ho, healy-yay, healy-o.

11:48.637 --> 11:52.663
Delio, roll along.

11:52.683 --> 11:54.445
Well, look who's coming up the trail now.

11:54.586 --> 11:59.112
Biggest life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all togged out in dungaree.

11:59.682 --> 12:02.705
It's Smokey Bear, friend of all who love the forest.

12:03.145 --> 12:05.547
And he's got a special message for us.

12:05.567 --> 12:07.489
Hello there, folks.

12:08.130 --> 12:14.475
You know, when I was just a little bear cub, I loved rolling around in the fresh green grass.

12:15.216 --> 12:17.038
That's what grass meant to me then.

12:17.598 --> 12:18.899
Something to have fun in.

12:19.580 --> 12:26.746
Of course, now that I'm a grown bear, I know that grass is more important than just to look at or have fun in.

12:26.766 --> 12:28.508
I know that grass

12:28.775 --> 12:37.425
in a lot of places is food and jobs and the difference between life and death for animals and human beings.

12:37.445 --> 12:46.615
That's why the grass and fields and on the range should be kept green and fresh and not destroyed by careless fire.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.857
I hope you agree with me.

12:48.877 --> 12:51.620
Well, I'll be seeing you.

12:52.301 --> 12:54.323
And there he goes on down the trail.

12:55.004 --> 12:56.065
Thank you, Smokey.

12:57.226 --> 13:00.649
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:01.390 --> 13:04.072
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:04.853 --> 13:14.102
You know, it's your own state forestry department along with the United States Forest Service and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:14.903 --> 13:19.287
Until we say hi to each other again, please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:20.007 --> 13:25.933
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent grass, brush, and range fires.

13:27.314 --> 13:36.467
Well, so long for now from Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and from those wonderful fellows who sing your favorite songs of the outdoors the way you like to hear them.

13:36.488 --> 13:38.510
The Sons of the Pioneers.

13:38.531 --> 13:46.783
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:47.524 --> 13:51.249
He can find a fire before he starts to flame.

13:51.590 --> 13:55.836
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

13:56.069 --> 14:04.302
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:04.923 --> 14:08.628
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

14:09.029 --> 14:13.035
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:13.596 --> 14:17.622
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:17.872 --> 14:35.256
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear

14:35.236 --> 14:48.250
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name

14:48.250 --> 15:25.000
