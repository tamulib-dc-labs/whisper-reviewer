00:00.000 --> 00:23.000
[Silence.]

00:23.000 --> 00:37.207
[Music.]

00:37.207 --> 00:45.097
The Texas Forest Service of A&M College brings you a story about barbed wire.

00:46.198 --> 00:55.890
Texas in the early days was a land of open range.

00:56.351 --> 00:58.253
Cattle roamed wherever they pleased.

00:58.688 --> 01:01.671
Fences were few and a long way apart.

01:01.691 --> 01:04.594
Oh, occasionally somebody did a little fencing.

01:05.274 --> 01:13.502
There was a cattleman in northwestern Texas who owned 10,000 head of cattle and only 320 acres of land.

01:13.522 --> 01:23.532
One day he said to his wife, Mary, them consorn cattle of ours are always hanging around the house here, and I'm getting tired of it.

01:23.932 --> 01:27.936
They seem to think they ain't another acre of land around here to graze on.

01:28.253 --> 01:32.857
I'm going to put up a rail fence all around our property and keep them out.

01:32.877 --> 01:34.839
I won't have them bothering me.

01:35.479 --> 01:38.302
Well, that was the way most people looked on the range.

01:38.862 --> 01:44.327
And if anyone had wanted to fence the huge areas of grazing land, it would have been almost impossible.

01:44.347 --> 01:51.854
The only fences known were the rock and rail fences, and there weren't enough rocks and timber in many parts of the state to build even a fence around a house.

01:52.875 --> 01:56.758
Then in the year 1857 occurred a significant event.

01:57.228 --> 02:01.954
A Swiss named Greninger was working in the old iron foundry in Austin.

02:01.974 --> 02:06.900
He had a house with a small orchard and garden near Waller Creek.

02:06.921 --> 02:11.226
One evening, he was sitting at home on the front porch of his house when he heard a voice out in front.

02:11.607 --> 02:12.948
Hey there, Greninger.

02:13.449 --> 02:14.070
Are you home?

02:14.430 --> 02:14.951
Yeah.

02:15.351 --> 02:17.254
Come on up and sit down, Mr. Becker.

02:17.514 --> 02:18.696
I don't mind if I do.

02:19.457 --> 02:21.359
Say, I got something I want to ask you.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.121
If I can help you, I will.

02:23.662 --> 02:25.885
Well, some of the neighbors have been talking...

02:26.185 --> 02:28.227
They said something ought to be done about it.

02:28.908 --> 02:33.052
What's this about some kind of fence you've put up around your peach trees?

02:33.072 --> 02:35.214
It's a new fence I have made at the foundry.

02:35.715 --> 02:41.340
I have twisted two wires tightly together and put sharp pieces of hoop iron between the wires every few inches.

02:41.941 --> 02:46.726
It is to keep the cows from coming in and pushing down my peach trees or stepping on my watermelons.

02:47.006 --> 02:51.130
I don't see why you have to wind those pieces of sharp iron into the fence.

02:51.329 --> 02:53.431
That cuts up everybody's cows.

02:53.451 --> 02:56.915
It is the only way to teach the cows to stay out of my orchard and garden.

02:57.516 --> 03:01.580
If I did not have the bits of iron to stick them, they would go on through the fence.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.122
Well, some of the neighbors don't like it.

03:04.143 --> 03:07.886
Then, too, some of the youngsters from around here have been getting hurt on the fence.

03:08.587 --> 03:14.013
Howard Jones, youngest boy, got all scratched up, not to mention getting his pants tore.

03:14.393 --> 03:16.235
Why did he have to come through the fence?

03:16.876 --> 03:17.517
I don't know.

03:17.557 --> 03:18.838
I didn't ask Howard.

03:19.038 --> 03:23.685
Well, it looks as if I'll have to take down my fence and let the cows and the boys go through.

03:24.426 --> 03:26.029
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.

03:26.710 --> 03:34.041
Tell the other people that I'll take down the fence as soon as I can get... And so ended the first story of barbed wire.

03:34.682 --> 03:41.171
But in a few years, several patents were issued in the East to inventors of various kinds of barbed wire.

03:41.191 --> 03:48.302
Because Texas was a fertile field for fencing, it was to be expected that a salesman should soon appear there to sell the wire.

03:48.417 --> 03:48.938
H.B.

03:48.998 --> 03:53.845
Sanborn, representing the two partners Joseph F. Glidden and I.L.

03:54.026 --> 03:57.751
Elwood, was probably the first barbed wire agent to come to Texas.

03:58.352 --> 04:03.040
John W. Gates was also credited with being an early barbed wire salesman.

04:03.060 --> 04:09.830
Many of the Texas people were skeptical of this new invention, and sometimes they had to be convinced it would work.

04:11.012 --> 04:16.180
I forgot to tell you, Pete, there's a drummer who's come to town to sell some newfangled fencing work.

04:16.598 --> 04:17.459
Did you hear about it?

04:17.479 --> 04:18.201
No, I didn't.

04:18.481 --> 04:19.803
I just come to town.

04:20.184 --> 04:23.028
Well, he has, and he's trying to show how good it is.

04:23.629 --> 04:28.036
He's got a fence corral he made out of some of this here wire down at the far end of town.

04:28.397 --> 04:30.941
He's gonna put some longhorns in it pretty soon.

04:30.961 --> 04:32.824
Wanna go down and have a laugh at him?

04:32.844 --> 04:33.525
I sure do.

04:34.046 --> 04:34.847
Which way'd they go?

04:34.908 --> 04:35.529
Down this way?

04:35.649 --> 04:37.772
Yeah, yeah, it's just down here and around the corner.

04:38.033 --> 04:42.640
Oh, any fool ought to know that a critter can't be stopped by a couple of strands of wire.

04:42.940 --> 04:47.566
Why, I've seen a steer tear right through the side of a wood corral like it wasn't even there.

04:48.567 --> 04:51.651
Oh, trust some city drummer to come in with a fool notion like that.

04:52.191 --> 04:56.096
Yeah, I reckon he's got the idea that these here are tame cows.

04:56.116 --> 05:01.463
It might stop the milk cows they raise up east, but not the sort of beef we got around this country.

05:01.483 --> 05:06.549
He had some of the ranchers around here get a hold of 25 of the wildest critters they could find.

05:06.569 --> 05:07.530
Hey, there they are now.

05:07.731 --> 05:12.036
They're just herding the cows in the gate of the corral.

05:12.792 --> 05:15.174
Them cattle are a wild-looking bunch, all right.

05:15.775 --> 05:18.717
Look at that drummer over there in a derby hat.

05:18.757 --> 05:20.079
He's getting ready to start them running.

05:20.859 --> 05:24.082
But the steers are only making a little pass at the fence this time.

05:24.102 --> 05:25.643
Hey, did you see that red spotted one?

05:26.304 --> 05:29.547
He got his nose stuck with some of those little stickers in the wire that time.

05:30.348 --> 05:31.969
Oh, they're getting mad now.

05:31.989 --> 05:33.470
Hey, watch them go right through it this time.

05:34.171 --> 05:35.392
Uh-oh, they're heading for it now.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.754
They're going to tromp that fence right down.

05:39.796 --> 05:41.938
Well, I'll be doggone.

05:42.627 --> 05:44.409
It stopped them.

05:44.429 --> 05:46.911
Stopped them dead in a mackerel.

05:46.931 --> 05:53.297
Two measly strands of wire with some stickers on it.

05:54.719 --> 05:56.581
Yes, it stopped the cattle all right.

05:57.001 --> 06:01.806
More and more of the ranchers began buying the new wire to fence in pastures.

06:01.826 --> 06:06.690
It was one way to improve the grade of cattle by keeping scrubby stray cattle away from the herd.

06:07.491 --> 06:11.335
The wire held cattle to their own range so they were more easily found.

06:12.209 --> 06:14.772
But something else came with the fence.

06:14.792 --> 06:21.018
The fence cutter and trouble.

06:21.038 --> 06:25.783
When a man fenced land in, he fenced everybody else out.

06:25.803 --> 06:29.747
Men had taken it for granted that the range was free to everyone.

06:29.767 --> 06:33.711
Nobody had worried much about who owned the land he had been using to graze his cattle.

06:34.592 --> 06:37.255
Now the fences were tightening in the open range.

06:37.876 --> 06:40.621
Some of the ranchers refused to submit to this new practice.

06:41.242 --> 06:46.191
Cowboys saw their jobs vanishing if wire fence were used to control the herds.

06:46.211 --> 06:51.059
So, men began riding at night to cut their neighbor's fences.

06:51.079 --> 06:52.923
Neighbor turned against neighbor.

06:52.943 --> 06:55.126
Friend turned against friend.

06:55.146 --> 07:00.576
All over Texas flared up a series of feuds known as the fence-cutting war.

07:04.825 --> 07:10.711
Say, Harry, did you hear that Bill Manners of the Diamond A is a-looking for Joe Stevens of the Y Bar?

07:11.232 --> 07:11.913
Is that so?

07:12.193 --> 07:13.715
What happened, George?

07:13.735 --> 07:17.839
Well, I hear that Joe cut the Diamond A's new barbed wire fence.

07:17.859 --> 07:26.669
Joe claimed that he needed water for his stock, and Bill Manners of the Diamond A had built the fence all around the water hole so Joe's cattle couldn't get to it.

07:26.689 --> 07:30.393
Well, does Bill Manners really own all that land he's got fenced in?

07:30.874 --> 07:31.855
Well, I don't know.

07:31.875 --> 07:32.976
He claims he does.

07:33.445 --> 07:37.090
Of course, he might have included a little land on top of what he's paid for.

07:37.650 --> 07:39.513
Anyway, the water hole's in the middle of it.

07:39.893 --> 07:45.440
Joe Stevens has been using that hole quite a few times for watering his stock, hasn't he?

07:45.460 --> 07:46.982
Yep, he has, Harry.

07:47.002 --> 07:55.673
He's got a water hole all his own, but it dries up pretty frequent, and he's been in the habit of herding his stock over to the water hole with a diamond A whenever he needed it.

07:55.990 --> 08:01.414
Now, Bill Manners has fenced in his place because he says he's trying to improve the grade of his stock.

08:01.435 --> 08:04.870
Yeah, I knew he'd shipped in some of that blooded stock.

08:05.474 --> 08:20.471
Well, now, what made Bill Manor especially mad was that when Joe Stevens and his Y Bar boys cut the fence and turned their cows into the water hole, they stampeded that blooded stock of Bill's, and now it's scattered from here to breakfast all over the country.

08:20.951 --> 08:27.078
And on top of it, Joe's boys set fire to a lot of Bill's fence posts, and you know how hard posts are to get around here.

08:27.578 --> 08:30.862
Well, George, I reckon you can't blame him for being some mad.

08:31.142 --> 08:33.625
There's been a lot of fence cutting around here lately.

08:33.925 --> 08:36.749
Some rightly and some wrongly, I guess.

08:37.410 --> 08:41.476
I think some of these fence cutters do it out of just plain meanness, too.

08:41.496 --> 08:44.981
Yeah, at least Joe Stevens thought he was in the right, though.

08:45.462 --> 08:51.911
But some of the night riders cut fences out of pure cussedness, and a lot of them are getting organized now in the bands.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.615
Those are the ones I think something should be done about.

08:55.035 --> 08:59.562
Yeah, I heard a Texas Ranger give a description of that kind of fence cutter.

09:00.166 --> 09:07.433
He said a fence cutter is a fellow who spends his time raising a few cattle and a whole lot of disturbance.

09:07.453 --> 09:13.059
He spends so much time attending sidewalk conventions that he doesn't have any time to fix up his home.

09:13.699 --> 09:18.704
He said some of the landowners are abused for wanting to do as they please with their own land.

09:19.204 --> 09:24.950
But a fence cutter's idea of liberty is to do as he pleases with his neighbor's land.

09:24.990 --> 09:25.971
That's pretty good.

09:26.491 --> 09:29.815
Well, I reckon Joe Stevens ain't a typical fence cutter.

09:30.295 --> 09:33.058
He probably did have some reason for what he done.

09:33.258 --> 09:33.739
Yeah.

09:34.319 --> 09:38.424
You know, I wished we could keep him from getting into a shooting scrape over this argument.

09:39.185 --> 09:42.188
Say, there comes Bill Manners now.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.690
Howdy, boys.

09:43.710 --> 09:44.731
Why, howdy, Bill.

09:44.911 --> 09:45.371
Howdy.

09:46.132 --> 09:47.694
Seen Joe Stevens in town?

09:48.355 --> 09:49.596
Why, no, Bill.

09:50.099 --> 09:52.862
But why don't you settle your fuss peaceable?

09:52.882 --> 09:54.504
Have a drink with us and take it easy.

09:55.045 --> 09:56.206
No, thanks, boys.

09:56.687 --> 10:00.312
There's one way to settle a fence cutter, and I figure on taking him easy.

10:00.932 --> 10:02.895
He's carried nippers for the last time.

10:03.235 --> 10:04.917
I hate to see you do this, Bill.

10:05.518 --> 10:06.840
Well, so long, boys.

10:07.460 --> 10:09.983
Think I'll take a look for him over at the livery stable.

10:10.724 --> 10:11.565
So long, Bill.

10:12.266 --> 10:14.909
You know, Harry, he's going to run into trouble all right.

10:15.410 --> 10:18.814
I think I saw Joe Stevens going into the livery stable a while back.

10:19.275 --> 10:19.515
Yep.

10:19.951 --> 10:21.473
There he is, they're coming out there now.

10:22.554 --> 10:25.858
All right, fence cutter, go for your gun.

10:28.941 --> 10:30.062
I'll be a son of a gun.

10:30.703 --> 10:31.504
Look at that, will you?

10:33.026 --> 10:33.166
Hmm.

10:34.087 --> 10:35.989
Reckon they've both lost that argument.

10:35.989 --> 10:44.038
[Music.]

10:44.038 --> 10:47.342
The war between the fence builders and the fence cutters continued.

10:47.828 --> 10:56.898
The fence builders said they wanted to build up their herds and protect them from cattle thieves, and they said the fence cutters couldn't bear to see someone else own property.

10:56.918 --> 11:05.187
The fence cutters, on the other hand, claimed that many ranchers were fencing in roads, waterholes, and lands which didn't belong to them.

11:05.207 --> 11:12.115
Fence cutting became so common that there were organizations of men who claimed that they would cut every fence in the state.

11:12.415 --> 11:20.352
A correspondent from Brown County reported that the fence troubles in that county had ceased because there were no more fences left in the county to be cut.

11:21.234 --> 11:28.048
In many sections, business was almost stopped and investors of capital were frightened away from Texas.

11:28.068 --> 11:30.373
Immigration to the state nearly stopped.

11:30.522 --> 11:40.075
Then, one day in the year 1884, newspaper editor Tom Berry came running into Steve Pierce's general merchandise store.

11:40.255 --> 11:44.440
Hey, Steve, I just got news that they passed the law down at Austin against fence-cutting.

11:44.460 --> 11:44.941
That's so?

11:45.242 --> 11:45.882
When did you hear it?

11:46.263 --> 11:46.703
Just now.

11:46.723 --> 11:48.486
I thought I'd run over and tell you about it.

11:48.546 --> 11:50.248
I've got to go back and write it up for the tribute.

11:50.428 --> 11:51.670
What's the law say?

11:51.650 --> 11:58.418
Well, it makes fence-cutting a felony instead of a misdemeanor, and it says that you have to put a gate every three miles in a fence.

11:58.799 --> 12:03.325
Then, too, it says you can't fence land unless you own or lease it, and you can't obstruct public roads.

12:03.525 --> 12:06.468
I reckon it's a good thing they finally passed a law like that.

12:06.488 --> 12:08.471
It should stop a lot of the scrapping around here.

12:08.851 --> 12:09.592
Yeah.

12:09.612 --> 12:12.716
Well, I've got to go over and set this up in type so it'll be in tonight's paper.

12:12.896 --> 12:13.377
See you later.

12:13.938 --> 12:18.163
Oh, by the way, I guess this will probably increase your sales of barbed wire.

12:18.163 --> 12:25.940

12:25.940 --> 12:33.011
And so ends the story of the Texas fence cutting war and the early days of barbed wire.

12:33.031 --> 12:39.020
Fence cutting gradually died out except in a few sections where it continued for a number of years.

12:39.040 --> 12:46.753
Today, barbed wire fences and the more recent woven wire fences are a familiar sight in almost every part of Texas.

12:46.773 --> 12:50.619
Thousands upon thousands of miles of fence stretch across the state.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.483
Wire fence needs fence posts.

12:53.598 --> 13:02.626
Mesquite and cedar posts in West Texas, Post Oaks and Bodark in Central Texas, pine and hardwoods in East Texas are used to support the fences.

13:03.326 --> 13:05.368
Millions of fence posts are in use today.

13:05.969 --> 13:14.776
Thousands of Texas farmers produce fence posts for use on their own farms and ranches and for sale throughout the state, adding to their income.

13:15.477 --> 13:19.380
10 million fence posts are cut each year from our East Texas forests.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.963
Millions more come from our other timber regions.

13:23.062 --> 13:38.480
The sale of these posts means income to many farmers, wages to the people who cut and haul them.

13:38.500 --> 13:42.257
A constant supply of timber can build a greater Texas.
