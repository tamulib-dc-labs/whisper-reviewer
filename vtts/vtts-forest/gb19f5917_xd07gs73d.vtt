WEBVTT

00:35.013 --> 00:38.779
Well, thank you, men.

00:39.140 --> 00:39.961
Thank you.

00:39.981 --> 00:41.143
Yep, friends, here it is.

00:41.343 --> 00:44.708
Once again, you guessed it, time for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knothead.

00:44.809 --> 00:48.855
Just a sitting here under the old pine tree, taking life easy.

00:49.436 --> 00:50.998
I mean taking life easy.

00:51.119 --> 01:00.994
Ain't it nice to sit out under the old pine tree and just relax and breathe that good, pure, clean air that sifted through them pine needles?

01:01.215 --> 01:02.657
Oh, man, that is something.

01:03.042 --> 01:07.368
You don't know what you've missed, for instance, until you find out that you haven't been under that old pine tree.

01:07.388 --> 01:10.693
Here we go with the first tune, and we're really feeling good.

01:10.773 --> 01:14.539
Robert, that boy, is feeling fine, just like peaches and cream.

01:14.579 --> 01:16.402
And here it is, Liberty.

01:30.543 --> 01:30.703
Liberty.

01:31.865 --> 01:52.438
Roll that horse first.

02:11.487 --> 02:15.773
What, no shaving a haircut, Robert?

02:16.054 --> 02:19.539
You forgot that ought to make him come back up here and do shaving a haircut.

02:19.559 --> 02:21.141
Come on up here and do shaving a haircut.

02:23.424 --> 02:23.665
That's it.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.847
Now, that's a little better.

02:24.867 --> 02:25.668
Thank you, Robert.

02:25.708 --> 02:26.589
Thank you a whole lot.

02:26.970 --> 02:35.402
You know, friends, I've been talking a long time, and you just don't have no idea whether you've done any good or not, and

02:36.091 --> 02:46.573
you just keep i just keep on telling you though hoping maybe somebody will hear some of it and maybe get a few ideas good ideas that i hope

02:46.672 --> 02:58.444
And all that, you know, I run into people on the street and they'll shake hands with me and pat me on the back and say, Jelly, I listen to every broadcast and you're really the best I ever heard.

02:58.464 --> 03:00.906
Well, I appreciate that to a certain extent.

03:00.926 --> 03:03.288
And of course, it makes you feel pretty good.

03:03.729 --> 03:07.592
But still, you hear that so much, so much, every day, every day.

03:07.873 --> 03:16.341
And then you go on down the street and you run into a fellow and he shakes hands with you, you know, and he says, you know, I've been listening to your programs and I just thought you boys was

03:16.878 --> 03:23.126
Just there having a big time, just carrying on more or less, just a bunch of fun and foolishness.

03:23.667 --> 03:29.955
But he says, you know, you mentioned one day there, you mentioned something about improving pastures.

03:29.975 --> 03:32.438
And he said, you know, I'll be honest with you.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.081
He said, that kind of got me to thinking.

03:35.101 --> 03:38.946
And he said, when I got home, I couldn't, I just kept thinking about it.

03:38.966 --> 03:40.388
I couldn't get it off my mind.

03:40.823 --> 03:44.330
And he said, I decided that you had a good point there.

03:44.351 --> 03:46.675
And he says, you know, Jelly, he was talking to me.

03:46.696 --> 03:47.838
Jelly, that's me.

03:47.858 --> 03:54.793
He says, I've just got to admit that I thought it was a good idea, and I've got an improved pasture.

03:55.334 --> 04:00.064
I fenced up my pasture, and I pulled my cows out of the woods and put them in this pasture.

04:00.652 --> 04:03.297
And he told me, he said, you'd be surprised.

04:03.637 --> 04:07.023
He says, of course, this was several years back, friends.

04:07.043 --> 04:13.614
And he said, you'd be surprised at how much better cattle I'm raising and how much better my timber looks.

04:13.634 --> 04:19.825
He went into details to tell me how the young timber was coming on, the cows and hogs and things like that.

04:20.294 --> 04:45.593
they wasn't there to eat them and they grew up into little little trees and and was just growing along fine didn't any of them get bit down or nipped down he told me he's keeping the fire out of them and that man was just tickled to death and he went on to tell me he said you know and some of my neighbors has kind of noticed my improvements and uh they they've started the same thing and uh it's it's really it's really good this man told me he went on to tell me he says you know

04:45.573 --> 04:51.920
One or two acres of improved pasture will support a cow the year round.

04:51.940 --> 04:56.205
Now, this is his figures along with, well, this is really something.

04:56.245 --> 04:56.946
Now, listen to this.

04:57.026 --> 05:08.619
One or two acres of improved pasture will support a cow year round when it takes 15 or 20 times as many acres of unimproved woods range to provide enough food for one cow.

05:08.639 --> 05:10.781
And then she don't get it the year round.

05:10.801 --> 05:11.462
Ain't that awful?

05:11.746 --> 05:12.688
Think that over.

05:12.708 --> 05:14.552
Here's the next team Slim's going to sing.

05:14.993 --> 05:16.376
Got a lot more I wanted to tell you here.

05:17.378 --> 05:18.680
No, you're going to sing, Slim.

05:18.720 --> 05:19.923
You're going to sing, yeah.

05:20.043 --> 05:22.548
I got your mind made up that you're going to sing here.

05:22.568 --> 05:24.332
Here are the requests.

05:24.352 --> 05:29.282
Tennessee, Saturday night.

05:31.456 --> 05:48.267
Now listen while I tell you about a place I know Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows Hidden from the world in a bunch of pine The moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines Civilized people live there all right

05:48.247 --> 05:51.350
They all go native on a Saturday night.

05:51.690 --> 05:55.094
The music is a fiddle and a crack guitar.

05:55.354 --> 05:58.337
They get the kicks from an old fruit jar.

05:58.637 --> 06:01.480
They do the boogie to an old square dance.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.723
The woods is full of couples looking for romance.

06:04.743 --> 06:07.826
Somebody takes a brogan and knocks out the lights.

06:08.046 --> 06:11.109
They all go native on a Saturday night.

06:11.730 --> 06:13.712
Well, all right, yeah.

06:13.732 --> 06:13.832
Yeah.

06:22.655 --> 06:35.483
Well, here's that shivers, boy.

06:46.583 --> 06:52.851
Well, when they really get together, there's a lot of fun.

06:53.111 --> 06:56.595
Cause they all know the other fella packs a gun.

06:56.756 --> 06:59.699
Everybody does his best to act just right.

06:59.779 --> 07:02.903
There's gonna be a funeral if they start a fight.

07:03.124 --> 07:06.207
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.632
They all go native on a Saturday night.

07:09.912 --> 07:12.936
Well, now you've heard my story about this place I know.

07:13.276 --> 07:14.818
Way down in Tennessee where

07:14.798 --> 07:27.711
Well, all right there.

07:28.011 --> 07:36.179
Thank you, Slim.

07:36.199 --> 07:40.603
That was Slim, 1001 Watts Watts, singing that Tennessee Saturday night.

07:40.904 --> 07:46.429
Friends, when you own your own land, well, you're your own landlord, and you're the master.

07:46.869 --> 07:47.510
You're the boss.

07:48.471 --> 07:50.613
Now, you can do whatever you please on that land.

07:51.814 --> 08:00.061
Just do anything that you want to, as long as you don't affect the other fellow, the other people, or the other people's land.

08:00.081 --> 08:02.784
Now, that's about burning.

08:02.804 --> 08:05.586
When you start to burn, well, you can burn yours off if you want to.

08:06.347 --> 08:08.129
The point I want to get over is this, friends.

08:08.729 --> 08:09.730
The important thing

08:10.013 --> 08:16.649
is that a lot of our biggest and worst woods fires here in the south start with such burning.

08:17.552 --> 08:26.554
Now, it's usually more than one man's land that's hit by such fires as these, and that's the real danger, because more and more folks don't want their land burned off.

08:26.872 --> 08:32.359
You can drive down the road today, and you'll notice on the side of the road, you can see it anywhere, in any section of the country.

08:32.719 --> 08:37.345
Where they've tore down the old house, the unpainted old house, used to sit there.

08:37.405 --> 08:38.526
You can see it in progress.

08:38.546 --> 08:41.069
You can see part of them tore down, partly tore down.

08:41.089 --> 08:45.214
You can see where they're building back a nice, modern, new house there.

08:45.234 --> 08:51.141
Well, friends, if you look right the other side of that house, you'll notice that man has a nice, fenced-up pasture with some good-looking...

08:51.425 --> 08:53.307
cattle are grazing around on it.

08:53.327 --> 09:09.147
I'll guarantee you, you're going down the road a little further, and you'll see that old unpainted house is standing there, and Joe Blow lives in it, and he don't care if that house is good enough for him, and if you'll just notice what few cows he's got, if he's got any, he's out there hustling and scuffling for a living out in them woods, and that's right.

09:09.268 --> 09:11.050
I mean, you already know that.

09:11.070 --> 09:18.259
There's no use of me going into that, but we just got to do more about this burning, and

09:18.610 --> 09:22.795
More and more folks are going in for these improved pastures.

09:22.955 --> 09:35.290
In the hill country, the heavy grazing, burning, that ruins the power of the land to hold the good water that the Lord sends down for us to use.

09:35.310 --> 09:41.256
And we get terrible flash floods in some sections of the country where people do these sort of things.

09:41.637 --> 09:44.280
People suffer pretty bad from some of them, too.

09:44.513 --> 09:46.656
Of course, there's a lot of you out there that already know that.

09:46.676 --> 09:49.260
You might have had it happen to you at one time or other.

09:49.280 --> 09:53.986
And it's happening more and more frequently because these lands have been abused.

09:54.006 --> 10:02.859
And you're just going to have to pitch in there and help us to try to take care of that sort of thing, friends, in our coastal plains country as well as in the hills.

10:02.879 --> 10:08.407
We are gradually coming to see that these improved pastures is the answer to a lot of things.

10:08.427 --> 10:12.693
Now, we can have good cattle, good timber, better kind of living all around.

10:13.093 --> 10:14.335
We just put out a little.

10:14.534 --> 10:20.324
and change some of these old foggy ideas and ways of thinking.

10:21.306 --> 10:23.930
Friends, there's a few that haven't changed their mind yet.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.593
There is a few, I'm sorry to say.

10:26.014 --> 10:28.438
But they're gradually coming on across, and they will.

10:28.658 --> 10:30.381
Here's the next team Slim's going to sing it.

10:30.742 --> 10:32.745
A little ditty called Mississippi.

10:36.556 --> 10:49.637
By the end of my crooked letter, crooked letter I, crooked letter, crooked letter I, I'm back, I'm back, I'm Mississippi, flowing down in New Orleans.

10:50.039 --> 10:56.973
Well, it flows right by my Tennessee home, where history was made by Steamboat Bill.

10:57.013 --> 11:01.862
M-E-M-P-H-I-S, Memphis is a town I mean.

11:02.744 --> 11:08.475
Way down yonder in the land of cotton, the hopes like mine are never forgotten.

11:08.495 --> 11:11.541
What a wonderful thrill it is to be.

11:12.044 --> 11:32.230
down in memphis tennessee where by the end of my crookie letter crookie letter right crookie letter crookie letter right i'm back i'm mississippi flowing down to new orleans

11:49.372 --> 11:57.007
Way down yonder in the land of cotton, folks like mine are never forgotten.

11:57.027 --> 12:09.270
What a wonderful thrill it is to be down in Memphis, Tennessee, where by the end of my crooked letter, crooked letter I, crooked letter, crooked letter I.

12:09.605 --> 12:12.568
Humpback, humpback, I miss sippy.

12:12.809 --> 12:15.011
Flowing down to New Orleans.

12:15.111 --> 12:22.500
Flowing, flowing down to New Orleans.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.581
Well, thank you, Slim.

12:23.641 --> 12:24.082
Thank you.

12:24.262 --> 12:25.123
Thank you a whole lot.

12:25.263 --> 12:26.344
Friends, we've run out of time.

12:26.364 --> 12:27.385
We've got to go.

12:27.405 --> 12:28.547
We've got to move along here.

12:28.907 --> 12:34.914
But before we go, here is just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you and I'd like for you to consider.

12:35.635 --> 12:38.498
Now, you can have good timber and good cattle, too.

12:39.457 --> 12:43.924
if you build a good pasture and separate those two.

12:53.999 --> 13:01.110
Friends, we've run out of time here under the old pine tree and we got to shove off the knotheads and myself, Jelly Elliot that is, and the three knotheads.

13:01.360 --> 13:09.035
We've been brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service.

13:09.055 --> 13:15.347
Now, friends, we'll be back with you, so listen to your announcer, and he'll let you know the exact date and time.

13:15.367 --> 13:19.555
Remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

13:31.482 --> 13:34.371
Lombo, chums, lombo.
