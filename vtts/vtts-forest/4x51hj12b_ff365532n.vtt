Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.390
Hello there, folks.

00:22.851 --> 00:26.695
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:27.176 --> 00:32.262
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:32.723 --> 00:37.749
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:38.349 --> 00:44.777
Today, it's Michael and Sarah, or Cochise, as he's known to millions.

00:44.797 --> 00:45.478
Cochise is...

00:45.728 --> 00:52.338
It was good of you to meet me here in the forest, along the trail, but why have you built a fire?

00:52.358 --> 00:54.881
Cochise does not have a fur coat as you do, Smokey.

00:56.023 --> 01:01.110
It was cold in the forest, so I built this fire to warm by just as many hunters and fishermen do.

01:02.312 --> 01:11.365
But see how carefully I have built it, how I have scraped the leaves and pine needles away and cleared a space a good four feet across down to the bare earth.

01:12.340 --> 01:18.631
I have kept the fire small because that is all one needs to stay warm or even for cooking.

01:18.651 --> 01:27.346
Hunters and fishermen and others would be wise to do as Cochise does when they build a warming fire or a campfire in the forest or near grassland.

01:27.366 --> 01:30.992
My people never leave a fire alone, untended, even for one minute.

01:31.854 --> 01:35.901
And we always put our fires out with water, plenty of water.

01:36.488 --> 01:43.457
And that way, the trees are kept green and growing, and the homes of the wild animals and birds are kept free from wild fire.

01:44.619 --> 01:49.926
These are things all of us must do because it is foolish and dangerous to be careless with fire.

01:51.788 --> 01:54.972
But tell me, Smokey, why did you want to see Cochise?

01:54.992 --> 02:00.259
To ask your help in preventing forest fires, Cochise, as you have just done.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.941
Thank you very much.

02:02.642 --> 02:06.327
Mr. Ancer, the Sons of the Pioneers have a special song for you.

02:07.015 --> 02:14.247
It's not Cherikawa, more on the Cherokee side, about a beautiful Indian maiden called Nahani.

02:18.835 --> 02:30.053
Long ago t'was here I know, lived the fairest Indian maid, daughter of a chieftain brave.

02:31.096 --> 02:34.260
Here beside the lake she stayed.

02:35.302 --> 02:39.147
Far and near the waters clear.

02:39.308 --> 02:43.413
Blessed her from their deep domain.

02:43.433 --> 02:46.778
Blessed her with this lovely name.

02:49.382 --> 02:56.091
Honey, it must be she is heaven's daughter.

02:57.252 --> 03:04.223
For her eyes and the skies form the lake's clear water.

03:05.725 --> 03:13.217
Sunlight plays dancing rays while the nipples bless her.

03:14.379 --> 03:22.011
On the shore evermore where the waves caress her.

03:23.999 --> 03:30.627
Far along the shimmering shore, the shallow waters clear.

03:32.108 --> 03:39.016
Echo to her lovely voice as she is drawing near.

03:39.737 --> 03:46.345
See her smile all the while for the sunbeams totter.

03:47.540 --> 03:56.368
To be gay all the way, honey, clear water.

03:56.889 --> 04:00.492
Honey.

04:00.853 --> 04:04.676
Honey.

04:05.937 --> 04:07.819
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.662
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:11.082 --> 04:13.885
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department.

04:14.253 --> 04:16.677
along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:16.737 --> 04:22.847
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to, that make these get-togethers possible.

04:22.867 --> 04:40.497
So until we say hello there again, and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:40.949 --> 04:49.800
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-stip in the air.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.505
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:54.565 --> 04:59.211
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

05:00.393 --> 05:09.083
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,

05:09.451 --> 05:11.108
Thank you.
