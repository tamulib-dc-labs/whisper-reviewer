00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
[Silence.]

00:18.526 --> 00:27.377
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.339
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:29.359 --> 00:31.522
That was how he got his name.

00:31.542 --> 00:32.503
Hi there, friends.

00:32.523 --> 00:34.445
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:34.906 --> 00:36.588
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:37.188 --> 00:41.033
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:42.234 --> 00:45.138
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:45.158 --> 00:47.841
That's because we kept fires from running wild through here.

00:48.428 --> 00:53.379
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:53.399 --> 00:59.894
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the sons of the pioneers.

00:59.914 --> 01:03.282
They've been waiting for you to get settled so they can do this song for you.

01:05.472 --> 01:33.235
Farewell, old rains, my work is through There's a roundup in the sky I give my pony back to you There's a roundup in the sky I'm gonna burn my brand

01:33.518 --> 01:56.320
On the silvery high Of a shootin' star And take a ride To a land beyond the great divide There's a roundup in the sky It longed, oh gee

01:57.869 --> 02:23.907
I'll be there soon.

02:24.548 --> 02:26.290
There's a roundup

02:26.472 --> 02:56.412
In the sky You know I hate to leave Old pal but still I just can't wait For the night until I'll be herding stars With Buffalo Bill At the roundup In the sky Get along Go here

02:57.303 --> 03:02.210
Up the trail, high tail, get along, doggie.

03:02.250 --> 03:13.224
There's a roundup in the sky.

03:13.244 --> 03:15.728
Roundup in the sky.

03:15.748 --> 03:18.131
That sort of gives us a look into the future, doesn't it?

03:18.531 --> 03:21.315
From the cowboy's point of view.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.737
Well, talking about the future...

03:23.324 --> 03:29.309
Isn't that really the best reason we ought to be careful with our fire in woods and forests?

03:29.329 --> 03:30.930
Now, take the little trees, for example.

03:31.271 --> 03:33.693
The little fellas that are just starting to grow.

03:34.794 --> 03:37.296
They're nestled down in the grass and weeds.

03:38.197 --> 03:42.280
In many places, you've got to look doggone close to even see them.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.141
And do you know something?

03:44.322 --> 03:50.787
It's those little fellas, tomorrow's trees, that take the worst beating when fire runs wild through the fields and woods.

03:51.988 --> 03:52.909
Look at it this way.

03:53.412 --> 04:01.280
Shouldn't we be as concerned about the children of the forest, the little trees, in a way, as we are about our own youngsters and their future?

04:02.521 --> 04:05.964
I think so.

04:05.984 --> 04:10.449
Hush, little baby, don't say a word.

04:11.510 --> 04:16.074
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

04:17.576 --> 04:21.900
If that mockingbird don't sing...

04:22.488 --> 04:26.992
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.

04:27.032 --> 04:37.882
And if that diamond ring turns brass, Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.

04:39.023 --> 04:49.373
If that looking glass gets broke, Papa's gonna buy you a belly gold.

04:52.002 --> 04:55.947
Yes, sir, what wouldn't we do for our young?

04:55.967 --> 05:01.474
We work for them, we plan for them, with the hope that their future will be bright.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.179
Forests are bound to be part of that future.

05:06.101 --> 05:12.549
We've got to keep them growing and productive so that our children will enjoy them and profit from them as we do today.

05:13.771 --> 05:20.119
In fact, you could say that the little trees and our youngsters are growing together for mutual benefit and good in the future.

05:21.162 --> 05:26.029
We've just got to keep the little trees growing and free from fire.

05:26.049 --> 05:27.631
They don't ask for much, really.

05:27.651 --> 05:35.221
Just the soil to suit their needs, a little rain or snow to satisfy the thirst, and a little care and thoughtfulness from us humans.

05:36.363 --> 05:38.766
Not to mention the light and heat of the sun.

05:39.587 --> 05:45.195
The sun which means so much to all living things, whether it be trees or man.

05:52.668 --> 05:56.696
Keep on moving, keep on moving.

05:56.756 --> 06:04.631
We've been following the sun ever since this day begun.

06:05.773 --> 06:12.446
And we're weary.

06:12.466 --> 06:13.849
Keep on moving, keep on moving.

06:14.572 --> 06:27.552
Till the fading western light brings the shelter of the night so dreary.

06:28.373 --> 06:36.445
Keep a movin', keep a movin', followin' the sunrise.

06:42.871 --> 06:50.499
those mountains from our way.

06:51.881 --> 07:10.341
Wheels are turning, hearts are yearning, following the sun all day, all day.

07:10.361 --> 07:11.342
People moving,

07:12.537 --> 07:14.540
Keep on moving.

07:14.560 --> 07:28.638
Every day and everywhere, there's been something in the air growing stranger.

07:28.758 --> 07:30.840
Keep on moving.

07:30.921 --> 07:32.082
Keep on moving.

07:32.635 --> 07:54.762
For we haven't heard a sound And the silence all around spells danger Keep a-movin', keep a-movin' Followin' the sun

08:00.884 --> 08:08.672
Move those mountains from far away.

08:10.334 --> 08:18.903
Wheels are turning, hearts are yearning.

08:18.923 --> 08:25.390
Followin' the sun all day, all day.

08:31.428 --> 08:43.406
I was talking about the little trees.

08:44.167 --> 08:46.991
Let's think about them in terms of future usefulness.

08:47.772 --> 08:58.768
These little trees that are growing today, some of them so small you could cup them in the palm of your hand, represent our future supply of lumber, paper, and thousands of other forest products.

08:59.795 --> 09:07.063
They must serve one day to hold the land in place, the land from which we get our water to help prevent erosion and floods.

09:08.305 --> 09:18.477
Someday they'll provide food and shelter for wildlife, and they'll be the trees under which our children and our grandchildren will spread their picnic lunch or set up an outdoor camp.

09:19.658 --> 09:27.287
In view of this, we must do everything we can to keep our little trees free from injury and destruction by careless fire.

09:28.128 --> 09:32.115
The sad fact is that millions of little trees are lost each year.

09:32.996 --> 09:33.778
Isn't that right, Lloyd?

09:34.098 --> 09:40.329
It's really kind of sad, Billy, thinking about the millions of little trees that burn up each year because folks get careless.

09:41.150 --> 09:44.957
Now, some things can get away from a forest fire if they've got legs or wings.

09:45.598 --> 09:48.122
That is, if they can move faster than the flames do.

09:48.923 --> 09:51.367
But the little trees, they can't take off and run.

09:51.768 --> 09:52.870
They're rooted there.

09:53.457 --> 10:05.050
And I guess the choice is nearly always ours, whether they get a chance to grow into big timber and serve a useful purpose, or whether they get badly scorched by fire or burn up completely.

10:06.071 --> 10:09.595
Of course, the wind plays a big part in all this, too.

10:09.615 --> 10:13.959
But the wind we'd like to sing about right now is a gentle whispering wind.

10:14.847 --> 10:22.789
[Music.]

10:23.967 --> 10:45.587
All day through there's an ooh Like the sign of a soul in distress Nighttime blue

10:45.972 --> 11:12.672
Rings and oohs As it sings of a loneliness Just like a prayer Set adrift in the air Calling me home

11:13.546 --> 11:34.238
Whispering wind comes a-wingin' a melody to welcome me there.

11:44.360 --> 11:55.394
I'm coming to someone who cares.

11:57.056 --> 12:05.647
Stars a-shine in the prairie skies.

12:06.869 --> 12:12.696
Guide my steps on to pass.

12:16.540 --> 12:39.252
Well, look who's coming up the trail now.

12:39.772 --> 12:42.536
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

12:42.556 --> 12:43.898
He's the popular candidate.

12:44.080 --> 12:47.123
The people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:47.824 --> 12:51.447
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:51.467 --> 12:52.949
Hello there, folks.

12:53.409 --> 12:59.355
I just want to say that when you support my campaign, you're striking a real blow for justice.

12:59.795 --> 13:06.882
Justice to millions of little trees whose main purpose in life is to grow up and serve you and your family.

13:07.343 --> 13:11.607
Next time you're out in the woods or forest, look up some of those little fellas.

13:11.857 --> 13:21.010
tomorrow's trees, and you'll see for yourself why it's so important to be careful with your matches, smokes, and outdoor fires.

13:22.492 --> 13:24.154
And there he goes down the trail.

13:24.995 --> 13:26.117
Thank you, Smokey.

13:27.378 --> 13:36.311
You know, friends, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:37.272 --> 13:41.037
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman,

13:41.270 --> 13:48.950
And those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:48.970 --> 13:54.283
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:54.888 --> 14:17.402
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear. Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find a fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear

14:17.382 --> 14:30.031
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin the air He can find the fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name

14:30.766 --> 14:50.553
[Music.]

14:50.553 --> 15:02.000
[Silence.]
