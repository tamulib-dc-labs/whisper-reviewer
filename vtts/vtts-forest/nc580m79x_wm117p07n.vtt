00:36.397 --> 00:39.285
Forrest Rangers!

00:45.745 --> 00:53.920
Today, we present the final program in this second series on forest conservation, featuring Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

00:53.940 --> 00:56.284
Our scene is Beaver Dam Forest.

00:56.304 --> 01:00.272
It is a late summer day, and the sun is about to set in golden glory.

01:00.993 --> 01:05.762
Outwardly, the forest and all of its living plants and creatures seem at peace with the world.

01:06.463 --> 01:09.829
And yet, on the narrow woods road that runs along Storm Creek,

01:10.214 --> 01:17.772
Small pebbles and bits of soil have been rolling down from above all day, a danger signal of more serious things to come.

01:17.792 --> 01:28.358
But Ranger Bill's niece, June, his two young assistants, Joe and Sam, have no knowledge of what's taking place above Storm Creek as they travel along the forest highway in the pickup truck.

01:32.000 --> 01:41.217
Even though this is the last day the three will spend on Beaver Dam Forest this summer, they seem unusually gay in spirit, excited, and downright frisky.

01:42.395 --> 01:45.940
Boy, won't Ranger Bill be surprised?

01:45.980 --> 01:48.184
I just want to see his face, that's all.

01:48.344 --> 01:49.405
A surprise, Potty.

01:49.766 --> 01:51.188
Uncle Bill will be pleased.

01:51.248 --> 01:52.009
Oh, sure.

01:52.089 --> 01:53.271
Ranger Bill deserves it.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.534
He's always doing something for other people.

01:55.875 --> 01:58.038
It's about time someone did something for him.

01:58.158 --> 02:00.381
I don't think Uncle Bill will ever think about that at all.

02:00.942 --> 02:01.824
Jesus.

02:01.844 --> 02:03.947
Hasn't everybody been wonderful?

02:04.067 --> 02:05.249
You bet, June.

02:05.269 --> 02:07.592
Just look at the stuff back there in the truck.

02:07.572 --> 02:12.216
Homemade bread, lemon pie, and homemade root beer from the McDonald's.

02:12.236 --> 02:15.840
Mmm, potato salad, coleslaw, and fresh fruit from Mr. Evans.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.881
And that gallon of ice cream from Mayor Arnold.

02:18.602 --> 02:19.903
Boy, I can't wait.

02:20.184 --> 02:22.406
There seems to be an awful lot for just the four of us.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.007
Golly, the folks were generous.

02:24.087 --> 02:25.388
We'll do away with all of it.

02:25.408 --> 02:26.549
Don't you worry.

02:26.609 --> 02:27.891
You just wait and see.

02:28.291 --> 02:30.593
Do you think Uncle Bill is wondering why we're so late?

02:31.194 --> 02:31.894
Mmm, I don't know.

02:32.155 --> 02:37.039
He told me to take it easy, to bring Joe down from Hawk Tower, and to pick you up at camp.

02:37.019 --> 02:42.225
Sure, but look at the stops we made at the McDonald's and Mr. Evans Farm and Mayor Arnold's office.

02:42.445 --> 02:43.627
Stop worrying, June.

02:43.987 --> 02:46.830
Ranger Bill knows we can take care of ourselves.

02:46.850 --> 02:48.773
And that's one thing this summer's given me.

02:49.153 --> 02:51.315
More confidence than I've ever had before.

02:51.416 --> 02:53.658
Oh, it has been a wonderful summer, hasn't it?

02:53.678 --> 02:55.560
Golly, the things we've learned.

02:55.580 --> 03:00.546
Not only how to take care of ourselves, but also how important forests really are.

03:00.526 --> 03:01.809
I know what you mean, Joe.

03:02.210 --> 03:05.036
As Ranger Bill says, there's certainly more than timber in trees.

03:05.156 --> 03:06.860
Wood for a thousand uses.

03:07.241 --> 03:07.963
And water.

03:07.983 --> 03:11.671
To drink, for irrigation, and to provide electrical power.

03:11.791 --> 03:12.393
Yes.

03:12.413 --> 03:13.756
And food for livestock.

03:13.996 --> 03:15.981
And food and shelter for wildlife.

03:16.001 --> 03:17.184
Don't forget recreation.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.108
Outdoor fun and relaxation.

03:19.088 --> 03:25.176
But it takes planning, June, and good care to keep the soil fertile and the land producing.

03:25.256 --> 03:28.660
You sound like a forestry encyclopedia comes alive.

03:29.761 --> 03:32.345
Well, it's not as funny as it may sound, Joe.

03:32.645 --> 03:38.092
We need our forests so very much, but we've just got to take care of them, keep them green and growing.

03:38.232 --> 03:42.617
We certainly were tender feet, yeah, before we met Ranger Bill, weren't we?

03:42.838 --> 03:43.218
Bam.

03:43.839 --> 03:46.342
I feel like a wise old woods veteran now.

03:46.362 --> 03:47.023
Yes, sir.

03:47.223 --> 03:48.825
My, aren't you two really sad?

03:48.805 --> 03:50.667
We didn't mean to brag, Jim.

03:51.128 --> 03:55.052
It's just that, well, as Sam said, we've got real confidence now.

03:55.332 --> 03:56.553
Sure, that's it.

03:56.573 --> 04:02.780
I bet you couldn't lose us in a forest anymore, and I bet there are a few tough situations that we couldn't get out of either.

04:03.100 --> 04:06.664
Well, I wonder what Uncle Bill would think if he heard you two now.

04:06.684 --> 04:07.926
Oh, don't mind her, Joe.

04:08.146 --> 04:09.908
He's jealous, that's all.

04:09.928 --> 04:12.791
Hey, look at that sun over there, and it's sinking pretty fast.

04:13.271 --> 04:14.813
We are running late, aren't we?

04:14.793 --> 04:17.222
It'll be dark before we get to the ranger's station.

04:17.242 --> 04:18.988
Aha, fear not, little ones.

04:19.310 --> 04:20.173
I have a plan.

04:21.317 --> 04:22.963
Ah, here's the turn I've been looking for.

04:26.538 --> 04:28.000
Sam, where are you going?

04:28.160 --> 04:30.102
Oh, I'm taking a shortcut, Joan, that's all.

04:30.442 --> 04:33.866
It'll get us to the ranger station in half the time it will take on the highway.

04:34.026 --> 04:37.269
Hey, this is the logging road along Storm Creek, isn't it?

04:37.289 --> 04:38.130
Oh, that's right, Joe.

04:38.430 --> 04:39.551
A real shortcut.

04:39.852 --> 04:41.954
I was over it last year during the big fire.

04:42.234 --> 04:42.795
Last year?

04:43.576 --> 04:44.436
I don't know, Sam.

04:44.657 --> 04:48.601
Ranger Bill has warned us about traveling on roads that we're not sure of.

04:48.621 --> 04:52.765
Maybe we'd better go back to the highway, Sam, even if it does take longer that way.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.282
Golly, don't you have any confidence in it, June?

04:55.302 --> 04:58.866
Well, I... Sure, this is a cinch to get us back in a hurry.

04:58.886 --> 05:01.028
Now, you just relax, June.

05:01.048 --> 05:01.848
Well, all right.

05:02.789 --> 05:06.713
Say, isn't that the most beautiful sunset we've had all summer?

05:06.773 --> 05:08.214
Gee, it's something all right.

05:08.274 --> 05:08.735
Sam?

05:08.975 --> 05:09.475
Yes, June?

05:09.736 --> 05:11.838
Sam, I'm not worried anymore.

05:11.858 --> 05:12.578
Oh, swell.

05:12.638 --> 05:14.620
I told you we'd be all right coming this way.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.521
Hold everything.

05:15.701 --> 05:16.622
What happened?

05:16.642 --> 05:17.263
Look, up ahead there.

05:17.283 --> 05:18.003
Good gravy.

05:18.023 --> 05:20.866
It's a big uprooted tree lying right across the road in front of us.

05:21.086 --> 05:22.127
Say, I'd better stop.

05:30.646 --> 05:32.552
Gee, I don't know.

05:32.712 --> 05:34.096
Let's go back to the highway, Sam.

05:34.136 --> 05:35.902
There's no place to turn around in June.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.787
We're right on the top of the cliff.

05:38.169 --> 05:40.114
And it's too far to back up all the way.

05:43.003 --> 05:43.705
What was that?

05:44.708 --> 05:45.330
Hey, look!

05:45.597 --> 05:46.638
Look at that.

05:47.099 --> 05:49.723
Yeah, all those rocks and that dirt coming down the road.

05:50.303 --> 05:51.285
I don't like this, Sam.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.488
It's the result of the fire last year.

05:53.508 --> 05:54.389
Sam, I'm fighting.

05:54.409 --> 05:55.551
Oh, now, June.

05:56.131 --> 05:57.713
Hey, quick, get behind this truck.

05:58.114 --> 05:58.555
Look out.

05:58.915 --> 06:11.292
It's a landslide, and it's right behind us.

06:11.312 --> 06:13.134
June, June, are you all right?

06:14.396 --> 06:14.997
I wasn't here.

06:15.449 --> 06:16.419
I'm okay, too.

06:17.248 --> 06:18.642
Golly, were we lucky.

06:18.942 --> 06:20.604
Let her scratch on us or the truck.

06:20.764 --> 06:22.507
And just look at those big rocks.

06:22.767 --> 06:25.190
Oh, but what a mess we're in just the same.

06:25.230 --> 06:28.494
Trey blocking us in front, heavy boulders blocking us in the back.

06:28.735 --> 06:29.416
Now for it.

06:29.676 --> 06:32.600
I guess we'd better call Ranger Bill on the shortwave radio.

06:32.620 --> 06:33.961
Yeah, I suppose we'd better.

06:34.542 --> 06:36.625
Well, there goes our surprise party.

06:36.645 --> 06:39.489
Ranger Bill probably will come and help us out of this mess.

06:39.829 --> 06:43.354
He'll see the food and... Oh, doggone the luck anyway.

06:43.534 --> 06:44.455
Oh, calm, Sam.

06:44.896 --> 06:46.738
Maybe everything will work out, yes.

06:46.718 --> 06:48.042
Oh, you're swell, June.

06:48.362 --> 06:52.915
Instead of laughing at us for talking so big and acting so mighty, you aren't laughing at all.

06:53.095 --> 06:54.679
Oh, we're all in this together, Sam.

06:54.699 --> 06:56.544
Well, I've learned a lesson, believe me.

06:56.965 --> 06:59.251
And Joe, I'm afraid it was all my fault.

06:59.332 --> 07:00.755
Oh, stop it, both of you.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.500
Sam, call Uncle Bill.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.122
I hope his set's on, that's all.

07:04.563 --> 07:05.284
Well, here goes.

07:06.286 --> 07:09.490
Let her warm up a bit first.

07:09.871 --> 07:10.371
Okay, now.

07:11.313 --> 07:13.897
SP-7 to Beaver Dam Ranger Station.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.939
SP-7 to Beaver Dam Ranger Station.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.902
Come in, Ranger Station.

07:17.922 --> 07:19.605
Ranger Station, back to SP-7.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.828
All right, go ahead, Sam.

07:21.868 --> 07:24.792
It's almost as though he expected us to call.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.074
Ranger Bill, we're in trouble.

07:26.294 --> 07:26.715
Come in.

07:27.961 --> 07:29.143
Sam.

07:29.223 --> 07:31.266
Road, Ranger Bill, on the edge of the cliff.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.108
Nearly got caught in a landslide.

07:33.429 --> 07:36.553
The truck's blocked by a big tree in front and rocks in the back.

07:36.833 --> 07:38.095
We can't move either way.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.057
Come in, please.

07:39.938 --> 07:41.540
Cut your way out.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.762
Is there anything else?

07:42.782 --> 07:42.982
Come in.

07:43.283 --> 07:45.025
Cut your way out?

07:45.045 --> 07:45.806
What does he mean?

07:46.086 --> 07:48.550
Holy smoke, are we dumb?

07:48.610 --> 07:49.091
Why, sure.

07:49.471 --> 07:54.018
We've got a two-man crosscut saw in the truck, and we can use the saw to cut our way out.

07:54.298 --> 07:55.740
You'd better answer, Ranger Bill, Sam.

07:56.260 --> 07:58.123
SP-7, back to Ranger Station.

07:58.443 --> 08:00.847
Okay, Ranger Bill, we'll make it all right.

08:00.867 --> 08:01.568
SP-7 off.

08:02.069 --> 08:03.331
That's the stuff.

08:03.351 --> 08:05.274
Don't waste time getting here.

08:05.294 --> 08:06.796
Ranger Station off.

08:06.817 --> 08:10.322
Oh, boy, weren't we the prized dumbheads, though?

08:11.043 --> 08:13.527
See, everything's gonna be all right after all.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.602
Hurry, boys.

08:14.622 --> 08:15.465
Let's get out of here.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.653
It's getting dark, and we still have a surprise party on our hands.

08:18.673 --> 08:19.776
Well, I'll get the sauce, Sam.

08:20.197 --> 08:24.449
It's a big tree, but we can cut it so that the top end will slide over the cliff.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.815
That'll clear her out of the way, yes, sir.

08:26.875 --> 08:27.758
Well, then, come on.

08:27.818 --> 08:28.259
Let's go.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.001
Let's go.

08:40.085 --> 08:43.829
Boy, that was some work-off, but we certainly did it, didn't we, Joy?

08:43.869 --> 08:45.571
I'm proud of both of you.

08:45.631 --> 08:46.732
There she blows.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.293
There's our ranger station ahead.

08:48.774 --> 08:50.976
Drive to the back, Sam, where Uncle Bill won't see us.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.458
Then we'll get busy.

08:52.518 --> 08:55.881
I just hope Mr. Glover sends those fakes in time as he promised.

08:56.181 --> 08:57.022
Hey, that's funny.

08:57.062 --> 08:59.325
No lights are on in the ranger station.

08:59.385 --> 09:00.806
No lights are showing anywhere.

09:00.866 --> 09:02.648
Well, we'll drive on back anyway.

09:03.128 --> 09:04.550
Say, I wonder where Ranger Bill is.

09:04.570 --> 09:05.991
He must be around somewhere, Sam.

09:06.392 --> 09:08.374
Don't worry, unless he sees us first.

09:08.394 --> 09:09.535
All right, we can stop here.

09:17.648 --> 09:20.460
Well, it's about time you got here.

09:22.348 --> 09:24.497
Where did all you both come from?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.646
They were hiding behind the woods.

09:26.896 --> 09:27.918
Yeah.

09:27.938 --> 09:29.240
Well, I'll be doggone.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.263
Look, there's Mr. and Mrs. Glover.

09:31.403 --> 09:32.484
And Tony Perkins.

09:32.504 --> 09:34.107
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

09:34.447 --> 09:35.749
And the McDonald's, too.

09:35.769 --> 09:36.651
And Mayor Arnold's.

09:36.671 --> 09:37.312
You bet.

09:37.332 --> 09:39.515
And Mr. Evans, how did you get here?

09:39.535 --> 09:40.476
It was easy, June.

09:40.677 --> 09:45.184
After you left my place, well, I just cranked up the helicopter and, well, it only took me a few minutes.

09:45.664 --> 09:46.946
I don't get it.

09:46.966 --> 09:48.028
I just don't get it.

09:48.308 --> 09:53.216
We planned this as a surprise party for you, Rangers.

09:53.236 --> 09:56.160
Now, you really didn't think you could fool the Ranger, did you, Sam?

09:56.140 --> 09:57.762
See, Rancho, I guess not.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.504
Oh, we should have known better.

09:59.524 --> 10:00.666
Well, here, here, here, now.

10:01.066 --> 10:01.567
Brighten up.

10:01.647 --> 10:02.809
Everyone's in on this party.

10:03.510 --> 10:13.903
You two boys have done such a fine job all summer, and you two dudes, you can't, but all of these good friends are your time this long before you did.

10:14.083 --> 10:18.990
You're absolutely right, Mrs. McDonald.

10:19.010 --> 10:20.832
Let's get going, Mr. McDonald.

10:22.567 --> 10:23.591
It's all fixed soon.

10:23.811 --> 10:26.702
Tom and Betty Glover brought over a big section of barbecued beef.

10:26.983 --> 10:28.589
And you've got prepared food in the truck.

10:29.010 --> 10:30.957
Tables all set alongside the ranger station.

10:31.645 --> 10:42.917
Come on, let's go.

10:42.998 --> 10:47.823
Let me tell you, folks, this is the best meal I've had in a long, long time.

10:47.863 --> 10:49.565
I guess that goes for all of us, Mayor Arnold.

10:49.765 --> 10:53.769
Gosh, it's sure going to be tough leaving all of you good people.

10:53.789 --> 10:54.991
Uh-uh, none of that, Sam.

10:55.011 --> 11:00.136
Now, you and Joe have Forestry College ahead of you, and there'll be more summers between sessions.

11:00.156 --> 11:00.657
Well, now,

11:00.974 --> 11:03.176
How about a little tune on that harmonica of yours, Sam?

11:03.757 --> 11:07.040
This'll be one farewell banquet that won't have speeches, I'm glad to say.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.522
Hold on a minute, Ranger.

11:08.562 --> 11:09.282
Not so fast.

11:10.043 --> 11:11.505
All right, Mr. McDonald.

11:11.525 --> 11:15.709
I'm not much of a speech maker, Mr. Mayor, but here goes.

11:16.730 --> 11:22.536
Ranger Scott, all these folks kind of elected me to say a few words before we wind up tonight.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.978
And I'm thinking this is as good a time as an insane.

11:25.999 --> 11:26.560
Well...

11:26.928 --> 11:30.972
No, no, Mr. Mack, there's no need for it.

11:31.052 --> 11:43.884
Here we are, a mayor of a town, a young young kid, a wife, young, and up-and-coming farmer, a schoolgirl, two schoolgirls, got in the museum, and saw in the shop on the street.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.046
Then there's you, a forestry.

11:45.206 --> 11:47.208
Then there's you, a forestry.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.929
And there's no forestry.

11:49.990 --> 11:52.913
What brought us all together?

11:52.933 --> 11:55.876
Well, sir, it was a forest.

11:55.896 --> 11:56.817
But more than that,

11:57.151 --> 12:01.176
It was what you're trying to do to help the forest service all better.

12:01.196 --> 12:02.017
Everybody better.

12:02.578 --> 12:04.961
I've made our plans for it.

12:04.981 --> 12:08.165
I just want to say we're mighty proud it happens.

12:08.185 --> 12:12.131
We know now how important it is to manage the forest for the good of all of us.

12:12.811 --> 12:17.958
To keep it safe from overcutting, from bulging, fire, from overgrazing.

12:19.600 --> 12:25.588
And if ever you want to teach other folks the same lesson, you're just calling us, Ranger Bill Scott.

12:26.497 --> 12:30.546
We're your friends in the friends of the forest.

12:30.566 --> 12:32.931
Well, is that all we got to say?

12:36.859 --> 12:37.421
Thank you.

12:38.363 --> 12:39.305
Thank you, Mr. Mack.

12:40.247 --> 12:40.888
Thanks all.

12:42.732 --> 12:45.177
Well, Sam, how about that harmonica now?

12:45.658 --> 12:46.480
Okay, sir.

12:49.345 --> 13:14.728
This time blend with the night air surrounding the Beaver Dam radio station.

13:15.097 --> 13:23.027
We say so long for a while to Ranger Bill, to June, Joe, and Sam, to all of their good friends, until another time.

13:24.729 --> 13:31.737

13:32.278 --> 13:37.765
