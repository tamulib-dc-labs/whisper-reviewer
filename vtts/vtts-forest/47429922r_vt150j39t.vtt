00:05.768 --> 00:09.738
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:11.222 --> 00:12.926
Hello there, folks.

00:12.946 --> 00:16.656
This is Smokey, the forest fire preventin' bear.

00:17.024 --> 00:22.431
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:22.932 --> 00:28.399
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:28.960 --> 00:31.363
Today, it's James Garner.

00:31.383 --> 00:39.353
Mr. Garner, as Brett Maverick, you have many adventures out in the wide open spaces, and you get around quite a bit.

00:39.957 --> 00:44.302
Have you ever run into a real mean forest fire?

00:44.322 --> 00:49.048
No, Smokey, I've been pretty lucky that way, and yet for my own part, it hasn't been all luck.

00:49.068 --> 01:01.323
You see, my pappy told me years ago, son, he said, there are three things you've got to always be careful about, wine, women, and fire outdoors, especially fire, because that's the toughest to control if you let it get the best of you.

01:02.444 --> 01:04.947
Well, sir, I've tried to do what my pappy told me.

01:04.987 --> 01:08.952
Since I'm outdoors so much, I'm really careful about my matches and smoke.

01:09.640 --> 01:14.725
I guess you know, Smokey, that as Brett Maverick, I try to keep my gambling on a sure-thing basis.

01:15.346 --> 01:17.468
That's another reason why I never fool around with fire.

01:18.389 --> 01:20.792
No one can afford to gamble with fire.

01:20.812 --> 01:24.235
Thanks, Mr. Garner, for those helpful words.

01:24.255 --> 01:27.058
Now Lloyd here wants a word with you.

01:27.078 --> 01:30.982
If Maverick is looking for new territory, Mr. Garner, we've got a suggestion.

01:31.563 --> 01:38.550
How about the trail that winds down along the sleepy Rio Grande?

01:39.357 --> 01:46.864
I ride along a dreamin' of the western plains and the days I spent along the Rio Grande.

01:48.025 --> 01:56.273
Dreamin' of my saddle days and the pony I used to ride as I got her to herd that wore the Bar X brand.

01:56.293 --> 02:08.925
I'd like to be a ridin' over the plains tonight down along the sleepy Rio Grande and see the lazy cattle in the pale moonlight

02:09.428 --> 02:38.473
As I gallop for the sand. Where the stars light up the trail that leads the way to home, tumbleweeds a-rollin' over every sandy dome, I'd like to be 
a-ridin' over the plains tonight Down along the sleepy Rio Grande I long to hear the whistle of the Whippoorwill And to hear the bobcat callin' to 
his mate

02:39.652 --> 02:43.658
I long to hear the clink of spurs as I gallop along the trail.

02:44.059 --> 02:47.223
I should be there and it's mighty hard to wait.

02:48.305 --> 03:04.950
I'd like to be a-riding over the plains tonight, down along the sleepy Rio Grande, and see the lazy cattle in the pale moonlight as I gallop for the sand.

03:06.027 --> 03:09.913
Where the stars light up the trail that leads the way to home.

03:10.474 --> 03:14.560
Tumbleweeds are rolling over every sandy dome.

03:14.580 --> 03:18.545
I'd like to be a-riding over the plains tonight.

03:19.307 --> 03:22.752
Down along the sleepy Rio Grande.

03:23.653 --> 03:25.295
Thanks, fellas.

03:25.315 --> 03:30.343
Golly, you know, I sure would like to have known the maverick boys, Pappy.

03:30.363 --> 03:33.107
He always talked good sense to his boys.

03:33.808 --> 03:34.549
He was right.

03:34.765 --> 03:38.288
and warning them against carelessness with fire.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.651
Well, that's it for now, folks.

03:42.351 --> 03:45.674
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

03:45.694 --> 03:51.659
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

03:51.699 --> 03:58.145
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

03:59.046 --> 04:04.350
So until we say hello there again and pay another little visit,

04:04.685 --> 04:19.337
To another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the sons of the pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:19.638 --> 04:24.027
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

04:24.277 --> 04:28.423
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' in the air.

04:29.164 --> 04:33.150
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:33.510 --> 04:35.513
That's why they call him Smokey.

04:35.533 --> 04:37.857
That was how he got his name.

04:37.857 --> 04:57.644
[Music.]

04:57.644 --> 05:05.000
[Silence.]
