00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
[Silence.]

00:07.000 --> 00:21.344
[Music.]

00:21.344 --> 00:22.546
Well, howdy, friends.

00:24.248 --> 00:26.011
Esther, this is your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott and.

00:26.212 --> 00:33.523
The Three Knotheads. Won't you just gather up a chair there and sit down and set a spell with us.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.386
We sitting out here on the old pine tree.

00:35.406 --> 00:44.820
We're going to be with you for the next 14 and a half minutes, and we're going to do our best to play a few tunes that you like to hear, the ones we get the most requests for.

00:45.621 --> 00:47.925
I want you to know to start with that

00:48.783 --> 00:49.524
Yes, sir.

00:49.544 --> 00:56.210
It's all brought to you, friends, with the best wishes and compliments from your state forestry service and Uncle Sam's forestry service.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.532
And we just want you to enjoy it.

00:58.732 --> 01:01.395
And enjoy it.

01:01.435 --> 01:01.935
That's it.

01:01.955 --> 01:03.256
Get your enjoys out of it.

01:03.276 --> 01:06.860
We're going to start off here with a lively little hip to diddy here.

01:06.980 --> 01:08.281
Robert plays on his fiddle.

01:08.982 --> 01:10.263
It's a breakdown.

01:10.283 --> 01:13.626
He's going to do one here that some of the boys cooked up around here.

01:13.646 --> 01:16.849
It's called Bear Creek Hollow.

01:16.849 --> 01:59.928
[Music.]

01:59.928 --> 02:03.435
Well, thank you, Robert.

02:03.455 --> 02:04.156
Thank you.

02:04.176 --> 02:05.158
There it was, friends.

02:05.519 --> 02:05.739
Uh-oh.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.424
Something went wrong with the broadcasting system here.

02:08.785 --> 02:09.666
Look out there, Deacon.

02:09.706 --> 02:15.037
You'd probably get blowed up there, son, and blow a fuse and strip a cog or something.

02:15.057 --> 02:20.046
Friends, you know, as I told you a while ago at the State Forestry Service,

02:20.330 --> 02:26.421
And Uncle Sam's Forestry Service makes it possible for us to come up here and pick and sing and show our ignorance for you.

02:27.182 --> 02:28.325
And we want you to enjoy it.

02:28.345 --> 02:33.734
But we want to tell you a thing or two or discuss a thing or four with you here along as we go.

02:34.496 --> 02:39.064
And the thing that we wanted to talk about today is...

02:39.398 --> 02:41.501
Got a lot to do with the woods.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.824
We got to take care of the woods.

02:43.844 --> 02:44.826
That's all there's to it.

02:45.487 --> 02:51.295
And we're just straining every point to try to do just that.

02:51.315 --> 02:55.962
Now, there's a lot of, you know, there's just a world of good people.

02:56.823 --> 02:59.807
But there's always something to take the joy out of life.

03:00.008 --> 03:04.414
And that is we got a few leatherheads mixed in with all these good people.

03:04.975 --> 03:06.537
And that's where the law comes in.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.885
The law knows a thing or two about this forest or two.

03:11.228 --> 03:18.661
It's funny how some folks are, friends, and I know most all of you out there, maybe you got a fellow there in your community.

03:18.681 --> 03:19.402
It's the same way.

03:19.482 --> 03:21.706
I don't know, but you could have, might have.

03:22.267 --> 03:30.302
Some of them get up on the wrong side of the bed in the mornings, and they're just grouchy and mad about something, no telling what.

03:30.322 --> 03:31.123
There ain't no...

03:31.373 --> 03:33.195
Tell him, don't make much difference.

03:33.215 --> 03:34.056
He's just mad.

03:34.856 --> 03:37.979
And he's mad at himself.

03:37.999 --> 03:41.323
And he goes out and sets the woods on fire.

03:41.343 --> 03:42.203
Just for meanness.

03:42.223 --> 03:42.984
Pure meanness.

03:43.785 --> 03:44.466
He don't care.

03:44.586 --> 03:46.327
He just set them on fire.

03:46.367 --> 03:47.989
Just something to be mean, see.

03:48.870 --> 03:50.271
And he says, oh, that dickens.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.733
Pappy burned the woods off.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.855
And grandpappy burned the woods off.

03:53.935 --> 03:54.996
And that's good enough for me.

03:55.076 --> 03:56.137
I'll burn them off, too.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.398
I don't care who likes it.

03:58.593 --> 04:06.070
And now that feller, it gets up in the morning like that, and he got mad about something or somebody, and he took it out on the woods.

04:06.090 --> 04:08.395
Now, he didn't do nothing but bring it.

04:09.157 --> 04:10.560
He just done the wrong thing.

04:10.962 --> 04:18.811
Now, that fellow's in jail right now, and that's the only place that he can go where he can't get up on the wrong side of the bed.

04:19.451 --> 04:26.979
It's just not good sense to go out throwing fires all over the woods, friends, and most folks is getting where they just ain't putting up with it.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.541
That's all there is to it.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.083
They just ain't going to have it no more.

04:30.143 --> 04:34.928
We're getting a shortage of timber and everything, and they just ain't going to have it.

04:36.005 --> 04:48.121
So I'm just going to tell you, friends, warn you, tell you, or I'm trying to get you stated here, that you just don't go around burning up man's woods anymore and get by with it.

04:48.441 --> 04:50.844
Well, that's just like going out and setting fire to his barn.

04:50.884 --> 05:01.658
You go out nowadays and let the fire get out over into a man's pasture or his wood land and burn it off, and boy, he'll have you arrested and put in a tent of pantry, a tent of pantry.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.239
Let's play another tune here.

05:03.259 --> 05:07.964
You know, we haven't done a hymn in some time, fellas.

05:07.984 --> 05:11.367
Y'all want to gather up around here just like you had good sense and do a hymn?

05:11.607 --> 05:12.788
All right, I'll tell you what we'll do.

05:13.369 --> 05:19.454
Robert and Slim and myself, we're going to gather up here, friends, and do our best to sing a very beautiful old hymn.

05:20.115 --> 05:22.237
Yes, sir, I can remember a long time ago.

05:22.277 --> 05:24.459
Used to go out to the little old country church.

05:24.479 --> 05:25.480
Still go out there.

05:25.981 --> 05:29.704
Yeah, and every now and then it comes time to sing this song.

05:30.022 --> 05:58.847
this beautiful old hymn I know a lot of you will enjoy it so here we go: Where Could I Go but to the Lord? 
Living below in this old sinful world, hardly a comfort can afford, striving alone to face temptation, so where could I go but to the Lord?

06:04.750 --> 06:08.316
Where could I go?

06:08.336 --> 06:11.320
Where could I go?

06:11.781 --> 06:29.188
Seeking a refuge for my soul, Needing a friend to save me in the end, Where could I go but to the Lord?

06:32.645 --> 06:38.893
Neighbors are kind, I love them, every one.

06:39.654 --> 06:45.501
We get along in sweet accord.

06:46.622 --> 06:59.158
But when my soul needs manna from above, where could I go but to the Lord?

07:00.573 --> 07:04.178
Where could I go?

07:04.198 --> 07:07.642
Where could I go?

07:07.663 --> 07:29.652
Seeking a refuge for my soul, Needing a friend to save me in the end, Where could I go but to the Lord?

07:30.695 --> 07:32.958
Ain't that a pretty old tune, I'm telling you.

07:33.018 --> 07:37.043
That just makes a goose bumps raise up on my neck.

07:37.063 --> 07:42.851
And I guess the more I sing it and the more I hear it, the better it is.

07:44.172 --> 07:51.442
Robert was leading us on that song there, friends, and if you like it, write us a penny postcard or letter and we'll be glad to do it again sometime for you.

07:52.463 --> 07:53.244
Sure will.

07:53.805 --> 07:56.008
After all, that's what we up here for.

07:56.148 --> 07:57.850
One of the things we up here at the

07:58.184 --> 08:07.015
Try to play and sing some of the songs that you like to hear and bring a few thoughts along to you to sort of help you there with the woods and all.

08:07.055 --> 08:11.000
That's the object is to take care of the woods and the forest and all.

08:11.060 --> 08:15.906
Now, we was talking about that fellow gets up on the wrong side to bed every morning.

08:16.447 --> 08:17.328
That's bad.

08:17.408 --> 08:19.370
I know a fellow one time.

08:19.390 --> 08:24.917
I knew of a case where a fellow, there was a couple of fellows had some sheep.

08:25.488 --> 08:26.229
Had some sheep.

08:26.329 --> 08:27.430
Bad sheep, you know.

08:28.171 --> 08:31.934
And I guess they've raised about 30 cents worth of wool on each sheep.

08:32.995 --> 08:39.521
And these two fellows went together and they hired a fellow to go out there and set the woods on fire.

08:40.342 --> 08:42.604
Well, he didn't know it, you know.

08:42.664 --> 08:47.709
He figured, well, here's me a chance to pick up some easy money right quick here.

08:47.729 --> 08:50.812
So, heck, he just got him a pocket full of matches and went out there.

08:50.872 --> 08:53.655
And, boy, he had the woods on fire all over the country.

08:54.209 --> 08:57.013
And there was a little old airplane circling around up there.

08:58.395 --> 09:02.701
I guess he figured they was looking for rabbits running out ahead of the fire.

09:02.721 --> 09:10.612
And by George, in a couple of days, the car drove up there in front of his house and got him.

09:11.573 --> 09:13.837
I mean, they put the handcuffs on that dude.

09:14.477 --> 09:16.761
And they didn't only get him.

09:16.781 --> 09:20.746
They fooled around there and went and got these two fellas that hired him.

09:20.766 --> 09:20.987
Yeah.

09:21.527 --> 09:21.988
Yeah.

09:22.222 --> 09:25.245
It took more sheep to get them out of what they got into.

09:25.325 --> 09:30.190
That airplane fooling around up there had taken a picture of him down there setting the woods on fire.

09:30.690 --> 09:35.135
Boy, they had their goods on that gentleman, and they really stuck him.

09:35.595 --> 09:39.399
Well, now, that poor devil, he never did stop to think what he was doing there.

09:39.820 --> 09:40.801
See?

09:40.821 --> 09:45.806
If he'd have just stopped and taken a second thought, he thought he was going to make some quick, easy money there.

09:46.366 --> 09:50.170
And by George, it cost him more than he could make in three years to get out of all that.

09:50.588 --> 09:53.351
In fact, I don't know whether he's out of it yet or not.

09:53.371 --> 09:55.513
He may still be in it.

09:55.533 --> 09:59.256
So you can't get by like that, friends, not anymore.

09:59.677 --> 10:06.563
Of course, right now, the people has smartened up to the fact, and they're just planting pine trees all over the country.

10:06.603 --> 10:13.570
And by George, you fool around there and let fire get out into them pine trees, and they realize what it means and all, and they'll sure make it rough for you.

10:14.211 --> 10:15.632
So you better watch that.

10:16.253 --> 10:19.836
And boy, the law is on their side.

10:20.710 --> 10:23.174
Boy, it's just got to stop.

10:23.214 --> 10:24.436
That's all there is to it.

10:24.456 --> 10:32.289
And they really, the Justice of the Peace and judges, oh, they're really cooperating with the local forestry boys.

10:33.010 --> 10:36.396
And for the good of the community, they realize what it is.

10:37.177 --> 10:43.828
And setting up, they've got heavy fines and jail sentences set up for these guys that set the woods on fire.

10:44.328 --> 10:45.891
So you better be careful, friends.

10:46.411 --> 10:54.621
I just want to warn you, be careful about them forest fires because you'll probably mess around there and have a terrible time getting out of it.

10:55.042 --> 10:56.523
They're really cracking down on it.

10:56.944 --> 10:58.265
Let's sing another song here.

10:58.966 --> 11:01.730
Clem, what are we going to sing this time?

11:02.531 --> 11:03.252
All right.

11:03.272 --> 11:04.693
That just fits the thing, don't it?

11:05.154 --> 11:08.818
Let's just dedicate that to that leatherhead that set them woods on fire out there.

11:08.838 --> 11:11.061
Here it is, and it's a Columbus Stockade Blues.

11:11.762 --> 11:22.304
[Music.]

11:22.304 --> 11:50.387
Way down in Columbus, Georgia, won't be back in Tennessee. Way down in Columbus, Docky, friends have turned their backs on m. Go and leave me if you wish to. Never let me cross your mind. In your heart, you love another.

11:54.383 --> 11:57.812
Leave me, darling, I don't mind.

11:58.834 --> 12:09.220
Last night as I'll be sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms. When I woke.

12:10.111 --> 12:12.757
I was mistaken,

12:13.960 --> 12:16.505
I was peeping through the bar.

12:17.929 --> 12:23.181
Go and leave me if you wish to.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.027
Never let me cross your mind.

12:26.007 --> 12:32.015
In your heart, you love another.

12:32.035 --> 12:37.363
Leave me, darling, I don't mind.

12:38.184 --> 12:39.586
Yeah, there it is, friends.

12:39.606 --> 12:40.687
That's an old-timer.

12:40.988 --> 12:42.790
We still get a lot of requests for it, too.

12:43.431 --> 12:45.394
Now, don't forget, friends, we'd like to hear from you.

12:45.734 --> 12:47.577
Just drop us a penny postcard or a letter.

12:48.215 --> 12:53.221
to Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads in care of the station that you're now listening to.

12:53.842 --> 12:55.103
And don't forget, we'll be back.

12:55.464 --> 13:05.857
And if you want to know when we'll be back, just listen to the announcer just as soon as we go off there here, and he'll let you know just exactly what day we'll be back, time and all that stuff and things, you know.

13:05.877 --> 13:09.701
And later, we'd like to have everybody listen.

13:11.023 --> 13:15.268
And we'll play a few of these tunes, and we hope that you'll like some of them.

13:15.890 --> 13:20.595
Friends, I'd like for all of you to get acquainted with your forestry boys out there.

13:20.655 --> 13:32.688
Now, them old not-headed boys running around out there in the woods like a chicken with his head cut off, them poor devils, I'm telling you, too, that's the hardest work in the world is fighting them fires out there.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.671
And I'd like for you to get acquainted with them boys.

13:34.711 --> 13:35.872
They can help you a whole lot.

13:35.892 --> 13:38.635
You'd be surprised at how much they can help you.

13:38.655 --> 13:39.296
We got to go.

13:39.316 --> 13:40.617
We've run out of time here.

13:41.478 --> 13:45.222
But before we go, friends, I'd like to leave you with just a little thought for the day.

13:46.045 --> 13:49.093
One tree can make a million matches.

13:49.113 --> 13:51.620
One match can destroy a million trees.

13:52.422 --> 13:56.593
Friends, we've really enjoyed playing for you and hope that you've enjoyed listening to it.

13:57.134 --> 14:01.506
And remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

14:01.506 --> 14:38.000
[Music.]
