00:05.212 --> 00:10.959
Hello there, folks.

00:11.360 --> 00:14.844
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:15.405 --> 00:20.231
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:20.612 --> 00:25.117
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:25.518 --> 00:27.140
Today, it's Clint Walker.

00:27.781 --> 00:34.189
And here we are, just where you might expect to find Cheyenne Bodie, out on the range.

00:34.456 --> 00:36.318
He's Brandon Cattle.

00:36.338 --> 00:37.780
Hi, Smokey.

00:37.800 --> 00:41.284
If you're worrying about this Brandon fire of mine, forget it.

00:41.304 --> 00:44.588
I'm always careful with fire when I'm working or traveling on the range.

00:45.309 --> 00:47.071
Grass is too valuable.

00:47.091 --> 00:54.179
This food for livestock is covered for the soil and a protector of water supplies to be burned up foolishly.

00:54.199 --> 00:58.003
And often, it isn't grass alone that burns when fire runs wild.

00:58.764 --> 01:02.168
Buildings, animals, even human life can be destroyed.

01:02.873 --> 01:05.578
That's why everyone should be careful with fire outdoors.

01:06.019 --> 01:09.025
With their matches, smokes, any fire.

01:09.045 --> 01:11.670
You see, I'm on your side, Smokey.

01:12.091 --> 01:13.995
Makes me real proud, Mr. Walker.

01:14.656 --> 01:19.686
And now my friends here, the sons of the pioneers, are going to do a favorite of yours.

01:20.267 --> 01:22.131
Tumble and tumbleweed.

01:32.523 --> 02:00.555
Fledging their love to the ground Lonely but free I'll become Drifting along with the tumbling, tumbling I'm a lonely cowboy Riding

02:05.767 --> 02:17.127
Tumble weeds around me sing their lonely song.

02:18.890 --> 02:30.711
Nights underneath the prairie moon, I ride alone and sing a tune.

02:33.796 --> 02:57.137
See them tumbling down Pledging their love to the crowd Lonely but free I'll be found Drifting along with the tumbling, tumbling

02:59.665 --> 03:29.622
of the past are behind Nowhere to go but I'll find Just where the trail will whine Drifting along with the tumbling, tumbleweeds I know when night has gone

03:30.361 --> 03:57.027
That a new world born at dawn I'll keep rolling along Deep in my heart is a song Here on the range I belong

03:57.935 --> 04:08.042
drifting along with the tumbling, tumbling.

04:08.543 --> 04:10.127
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:10.448 --> 04:12.433
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:12.818 --> 04:17.282
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:17.322 --> 04:22.387
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:22.968 --> 04:34.579
Until we say hello there again, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you can prevent forest and range fires.

04:34.859 --> 04:39.163
Smokey the Bears, Smokey the Bears,

04:39.447 --> 04:53.102
Crowlin' and a-growlin' and a-slip in the air He can find the fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name

05:01.385 --> 05:09.673
The End
