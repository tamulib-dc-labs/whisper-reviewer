00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
[Silence.]

00:12.000 --> 00:24.353
Timber! Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

00:24.353 --> 00:30.373
[Music.]

00:30.373 --> 00:37.541
Today we present the fourth in our series of programs on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, Forest Ranger.

00:38.882 --> 00:42.306
Our scene is Rockville, a little town near Beaver Dam Forest.

00:43.028 --> 00:47.013
From overhead a sullen, cloud-filled sky looks down upon a scene of desolation.

00:47.534 --> 00:59.649
Water is everywhere, swirling through the streets, over the tops of stranded automobiles, around the small boats carrying the last of the townspeople and their pet dogs, cats and canaries to higher ground and safety.

00:59.669 --> 01:03.674
In one respect at least, good fortune has smiled upon Rockville.

01:04.134 --> 01:07.078
Not one life, human or animal, has been lost.

01:07.835 --> 01:20.226
For a long time now, Ranger Bill and his two young friends, Joe and Sam, have been working like Trojans alongside the mill crew, defending the valuable sawmill against the onrushing floodwaters of swollen Rockville River.

01:20.246 --> 01:29.254
As they work, piling sandbag upon sandbag on the bank of the threatening river, Ranger Bill pauses now and again to comfort the two lads and praise them for their labor.

01:29.274 --> 01:30.636
You're doing a swell job, Joe.

01:31.116 --> 01:32.357
How do you feel?

01:32.377 --> 01:33.278
I'm okay, Ranger Bill.

01:33.798 --> 01:35.100
Hand me another sandbag, Sam.

01:35.220 --> 01:35.580
Okay.

01:36.281 --> 01:36.901
Here you are, Joe.

01:37.081 --> 01:37.842
How about you, Sam?

01:38.328 --> 01:39.852
Haven't you and Joe had enough for a while?

01:40.112 --> 01:41.957
You've been going for quite a spell now, you two.

01:42.017 --> 01:43.040
Quit?

01:43.060 --> 01:44.864
We've got old man River just about licked.

01:45.145 --> 01:45.927
Oh, no, sir.

01:45.967 --> 01:47.370
That goes for me too, Ranger Bill.

01:47.831 --> 01:50.498
We're going to see this job through, Sam and I. Good boys.

01:50.839 --> 01:52.202
And it shouldn't be too long now.

01:52.418 --> 01:56.246
Just as soon as they're sure these sandbags will hold the water back, they're going to start the mill.

01:56.346 --> 01:56.847
Good boy.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.051
Then we'll get to see the big saw at work, huh?

01:59.212 --> 02:03.921
Well, this mill's got as important a job to do right now, boys, as it had to oral during the war.

02:03.941 --> 02:05.905
I'm mighty glad they've got enough logs on hand.

02:05.925 --> 02:08.029
This is a real emergency, isn't it, Ranger Bill?

02:08.049 --> 02:08.570
You bet, Joe.

02:08.590 --> 02:09.432
It certainly is.

02:09.648 --> 02:16.219
A lot of these Rockville folks have been flooded out of their homes, and they certainly need lumber badly for temporary shelter until this water runs off.

02:16.339 --> 02:18.102
Where did they get all those logs?

02:18.122 --> 02:20.926
They're stacked behind the mill and in this little pond back of us.

02:20.946 --> 02:23.971
Well, most of them are from the farm woodlands around Rockville, Sam.

02:24.833 --> 02:25.434
Oh, all right, Joe.

02:25.674 --> 02:27.197
Put another sandbag up here on top.

02:27.537 --> 02:28.519
Now lift it easily now.

02:28.999 --> 02:30.041
Bend your knees as I showed you.

02:30.422 --> 02:31.263
That's it.

02:31.283 --> 02:31.784
Now lift now.

02:32.024 --> 02:33.306
Keep your back straight.

02:33.326 --> 02:36.211
I don't want you youngsters to strain yourselves.

02:36.231 --> 02:36.752
I've got it.

02:37.255 --> 02:37.918
Fine.

02:37.938 --> 02:39.847
These are pretty nice logs, aren't they, Ranger Bill?

02:39.988 --> 02:40.570
Big and all.

02:41.193 --> 02:42.861
They're a fine lot of logs, Sam.

02:43.060 --> 02:47.626
Good indication that the farmers who cut and sold that timber really used their heads as well as their hands.

02:47.646 --> 02:49.048
What do you mean by that, Ranger Bill?

02:49.249 --> 02:52.994
Well, just that they didn't cut all their small trees, only those that were ready for cutting.

02:53.014 --> 02:53.715
I get it.

02:54.036 --> 02:58.201
You mean the farmers saved their little trees for another crop as you showed us in Beaver Dam Park?

02:58.462 --> 03:00.425
Then they'll have trees growing for years.

03:00.445 --> 03:01.186
Well, that's it, Joe.

03:01.586 --> 03:09.237
Unfortunately, most farmers and other forest land owners, especially the owners of small timber areas, are not doing too good a job of handling their timber timber.

03:09.790 --> 03:16.039
We've got to help those folks who just don't seem to realize how important and valuable their timber is to them and their community.

03:16.579 --> 03:18.923
No, we've got to help them to keep their timber producing.

03:18.963 --> 03:19.644
Ranger Bill, look there.

03:19.664 --> 03:20.525
Yeah, what's the matter, Sal?

03:20.545 --> 03:22.227
The water doesn't seem to be rising anymore.

03:22.267 --> 03:23.209
Say, you're right, Joe.

03:24.010 --> 03:24.571
We've licked her.

03:24.851 --> 03:25.932
We've licked the flood, men.

03:25.952 --> 03:26.974
We've licked the flood.

03:27.034 --> 03:27.875
We've licked her.

03:27.895 --> 03:29.978
Golly, this sure is exciting.

03:30.238 --> 03:32.101
What about the sawmill, Ranger Bill?

03:32.381 --> 03:33.463
Can we watch them, can we?

03:33.563 --> 03:34.845
What do you say, Ranger Bill?

03:34.865 --> 03:36.707
Let's watch them go to work on those logs.

03:36.768 --> 03:39.291
You boys are certainly bears for punishment, aren't you?

03:39.271 --> 03:42.094
Don't you want to sit down and take it easy for a little while?

03:42.114 --> 03:43.475
Both certainly earned a rest, you know.

03:43.676 --> 03:44.997
I am kind of tired of that.

03:45.077 --> 03:45.938
Oh, sure you're tired.

03:46.218 --> 03:49.702
Come on, let's sit down here by the mill pond for a few minutes.

03:49.722 --> 03:50.483
There, that feel better?

03:50.543 --> 03:51.584
Oh, boy.

03:51.604 --> 03:53.085
It does feel good to sit down again.

03:54.387 --> 03:57.290
Oh, look, fellas, they're storing the logs moving from the pond up to the mill.

03:57.490 --> 03:59.852
Why do they store logs in the mill pond range as well?

03:59.872 --> 04:04.778
Well, Sam, in logging seasons, trees and logs are usually cut faster than the mill can use them.

04:04.798 --> 04:06.139
So they've got to be stored.

04:06.507 --> 04:10.651
Sometimes they put them in a log yard, sometimes in a mill pond like this.

04:10.952 --> 04:13.414
You see, mill pond storage has its advantages, all right.

04:13.454 --> 04:17.118
They sure move those logs fast as that chain go up, going up into the mill.

04:17.158 --> 04:18.239
Well, that's one advantage.

04:18.599 --> 04:22.603
Another is that the wet logs don't split or crack like dry logs do.

04:22.623 --> 04:28.770
Then, too, the water washes off the logs, gets rid of gravel and stones that can injure a saw if it runs into them.

04:28.790 --> 04:29.210
Think.

04:29.230 --> 04:30.291
Think what's that, Ranger Bill?

04:30.532 --> 04:31.212
The saw stopped.

04:31.453 --> 04:32.454
I've gone to luck.

04:32.474 --> 04:33.915
There's something the matter with that saw.

04:33.895 --> 04:56.072
if it's what i think it is i hope they have extra saw teeth around come on boys let's see what the trouble is just as i thought some of the saw teeth have been damaged you see that boys

04:56.440 --> 04:58.764
So one of the men now are replacing the bad teeth with new ones.

04:58.785 --> 05:00.508
Golly, I never knew you could do that.

05:00.728 --> 05:03.053
Put new ones in a saw.

05:03.193 --> 05:04.676
Well, it's a good thing you can, Joe.

05:05.197 --> 05:08.924
Otherwise, you'd have to replace the whole saw, and that's usually a pretty tough job.

05:09.485 --> 05:11.429
Look how fast that man's working, Ranger Bill.

05:11.569 --> 05:14.635
Well, he knows how important it is to keep the mill going right now, Sam.

05:14.834 --> 05:17.037
Oh, here comes Tom Roberts, the mill boss.

05:17.057 --> 05:19.139
He can tell us all about that store.

05:19.159 --> 05:19.560
Hello there, Ranger.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.881
Hello there, Tom.

05:21.202 --> 05:24.386
Certainly appreciate the help you fellas gave us with those sandbags.

05:24.446 --> 05:25.147
I'm glad to help.

05:25.167 --> 05:27.409
Tom, we were just wondering what happened to that store.

05:28.030 --> 05:33.116
The usual thing, Ranger, is somebody drove a big nail into a tree when it was small.

05:33.757 --> 05:35.579
Then the tree grew bigger, of course.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.563
The nail was covered up under new bark and wood.

05:39.083 --> 05:44.649
A log without nail deep in it came into this mill and a saw ran against the nail and blew it.

05:44.669 --> 05:45.711
Oh, it's a shame.

05:45.731 --> 05:47.953
Half a dozen good saw teeth wrecked just like that.

05:49.175 --> 05:52.198
Bad business driving nails or shooting bullets into a tree.

05:52.539 --> 05:53.540
That's tough luck, Tom.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.362
Could have been lots worse, Ranger.

05:55.382 --> 05:55.943
I guess so.

05:56.363 --> 05:59.046
At least we got a fair supply of extra teeth here in the mill.

05:59.787 --> 06:04.112
What's worrying me is what we'll do if anything really serious goes wrong.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.306
Our supply house is pretty well underwater down by the river.

06:07.346 --> 06:09.851
We'll keep our fingers crossed for luck, Mr. Roberts.

06:09.891 --> 06:10.392
We certainly will.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.234
That's the stuff, boy.

06:11.695 --> 06:15.162
Our folks need lumber so badly we can't afford to have many shut down.

06:15.663 --> 06:17.166
Well, I've got to get back to work.

06:17.186 --> 06:18.229
Okay, we'll see you, Tom.

06:18.329 --> 06:19.792
It's got her going again, Ranger Bill.

06:20.052 --> 06:21.115
The saw's working again.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.299
Now let's move back here out of the way, fellas.

06:23.667 --> 06:26.011
Boy, look how that saw eats into the log, will you?

06:26.251 --> 06:33.223
Ranger Bill, what do you call the man who's running the saw and working all those levers that make the log move back and forth every time he saws aboard?

06:33.463 --> 06:34.565
He's the head sawyer, Joe.

06:35.026 --> 06:37.049
Just about the most important fellow in the mill.

06:37.710 --> 06:40.314
And that's the saw carriage that his log is on.

06:40.655 --> 06:43.519
Why does he keep turning the log on the saw carriage, Ranger Bill?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.823
Well, to get the most clear lumber that he can, Sam.

06:46.304 --> 06:48.207
That's where the sawyer's skill really comes in.

06:48.490 --> 06:52.237
Clear boards are worth more money than boards with knots or other defects in them.

06:52.257 --> 06:54.661
Why should he be so careful now, Ranger Bill?

06:54.681 --> 06:59.970
The folks in Rockville won't care if there's a knot or two in these boards, just so they have some shelter for a while.

07:00.051 --> 07:02.375
You're certainly a stickler for detail, aren't you, Sam?

07:02.936 --> 07:07.804
Well, the truth is, though, that the Sawyer's doing as skillful a job as he's learned through the years.

07:07.824 --> 07:09.908
It doesn't take him any longer to do a good job.

07:10.276 --> 07:13.440
And he's going to turn out the best lumber he can, no matter what it's used for.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.022
What are those other saws, Ranger Bill?

07:15.182 --> 07:15.983
The smaller ones.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.627
Oh, you mean the edger and the trimmer saws, Joe.

07:18.647 --> 07:18.947
That's it.

07:18.967 --> 07:19.748
Is that what you call them?

07:19.768 --> 07:20.229
That's right.

07:20.289 --> 07:23.273
The edger, you see, cuts the bark and rough edges from the boards.

07:23.633 --> 07:25.756
And the trimmers cut the boards in the proper length.

07:26.116 --> 07:26.958
Now, any more questions?

07:26.978 --> 07:27.699
Yes, I have one.

07:28.279 --> 07:30.742
What do they do with all the sawdust and other stuff that's left?

07:30.963 --> 07:34.968
Well, most of the waste in this mill, other than the sawdust, goes down to the boiler room, Sam.

07:35.208 --> 07:35.729
Oh, I know.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.352
They burn it for steam and power to run the mill.

07:38.432 --> 07:38.933
That's right.

07:39.250 --> 07:48.902
However, in many places, they're beginning to find new uses for sawdust and other wood waste, for fuel to heat homes and wood alcohol and other chemicals, you know, plastics and the like.

07:49.764 --> 07:53.348
Now, there's certainly more than wooden boards and trees, and don't you boys ever forget that.

07:53.428 --> 07:54.510
Sure, I know, Ranger Bill.

07:54.830 --> 07:56.612
How about telephone poles?

07:56.632 --> 07:56.973
That's it.

07:57.454 --> 07:58.054
Fence posts?

07:58.114 --> 07:58.595
Oh, I know.

07:58.695 --> 07:59.516
Railroad ties?

07:59.777 --> 08:00.077
Mm-hmm.

08:00.097 --> 08:00.938
Newspapers?

08:01.390 --> 08:04.255
Cardboard boxes, and sure, the pencils we used in school.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.702
Yes, and don't forget products like rosin and turpentine from our southern trees.

08:07.762 --> 08:09.926
Say, what about Christmas trees, Rainier Bill?

08:09.946 --> 08:11.669
What would we ever do without Christmas trees?

08:11.869 --> 08:13.052
Holly and stuff like that.

08:13.532 --> 08:14.735
Yes, and mistletoe, Joe.

08:15.115 --> 08:16.057
Say, that rhymes.

08:16.478 --> 08:17.860
Here Joe is some mistletoe.

08:19.003 --> 08:21.407
Well, you youngsters certainly get the idea, all right.

08:22.535 --> 08:26.779
Yeah, golly, you know, Ranger Bill, we sure get a lot of things from our forests, don't we?

08:26.799 --> 08:28.841
Yes, and it's not all wood, Joe, hmm?

08:28.861 --> 08:29.421
No, sir.

08:29.722 --> 08:32.544
Boy, look how fast they're moving those boards out of here, Ranger Bill.

08:32.905 --> 08:34.026
Are they going right into town?

08:34.126 --> 08:34.947
Yes, Sam, they are.

08:35.367 --> 08:39.150
I reckon the carpenters are putting that green lumber to use just as soon as it reaches them.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.072
What do you mean by green lumber, Ranger Bill?

08:41.292 --> 08:46.057
Well, normally, Joe, you see, lumber is dried out, or seasoned as we call it, before it's used.

08:46.717 --> 08:48.879
And it's green lumber as it comes from the saw.

08:48.939 --> 08:50.601
Well, how do they season lumber?

08:50.750 --> 08:54.595
Well, sometimes they stack it in open places where the air can get at it.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.640
You see, that way it takes about three months to a year to dry the lumber out thoroughly.

08:59.041 --> 09:03.767
Or they can put it in heated ovens or dry kills to do the same job in a much shorter time.

09:03.947 --> 09:06.691
And the best lumber to use is seasoned lumber then, huh, Ranger Bill?

09:06.711 --> 09:07.351
That's right, Sam.

09:07.632 --> 09:10.936
But as you say, we certainly can't be too particular in this emergency.

09:11.537 --> 09:14.040
And, you know, maybe those boards won't be wasted either.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.784
Maybe they'll be put to further use when this emergency is over.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.186
Ranger Bill, look up there.

09:18.526 --> 09:19.187
What's the matter, Joe?

09:19.267 --> 09:22.772
That big leather belt that's going round and round up there, just over our heads.

09:23.013 --> 09:24.154
Isn't it acting kind of crazy?

09:24.635 --> 09:25.637
Oh, oh, that's the main belt.

09:25.657 --> 09:27.039
It runs the whole works here in the mill.

09:27.259 --> 09:29.903
Of course, it wobbles a bit sometimes, but... Say, wait a minute.

09:30.223 --> 09:30.904
You're right, son.

09:31.465 --> 09:31.766
Tom!

09:32.146 --> 09:33.348
Tom Roberts, stop the mill!

09:33.448 --> 09:36.072
Stop her!

09:36.252 --> 09:37.274
What's the trouble, Ranger?

09:37.574 --> 09:42.241
Tom, you can certainly thank Joe here for preventing what might have been a pretty serious accident.

09:42.261 --> 09:43.723
Just take a look at this main belt here.

09:44.058 --> 09:45.220
Holy smoke.

09:46.261 --> 09:50.007
A couple more turns and she'd have snapped right in two.

09:50.027 --> 09:51.309
Somebody might have got hurt at that.

09:51.450 --> 09:52.211
That's right, Tom.

09:52.651 --> 09:53.853
Just beginning to tear apart.

09:54.755 --> 09:56.237
It's the oldest section of our belt.

09:56.978 --> 09:59.883
The laces are worn pretty badly.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.726
Well, I'm afraid that does it.

10:02.246 --> 10:07.575
Putting in new saw teeth wasn't so bad, but fixing this belt, that's something else again.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.057
She's really sunk now.

10:09.297 --> 10:10.960
She don't have any replacement here, Tom?

10:11.260 --> 10:12.522
Oh, that's pretty tough.

10:12.822 --> 10:15.286
Our main supply's underwater, as I told you.

10:15.306 --> 10:15.386
Oh.

10:15.707 --> 10:18.611
Well, I guess we'll have to shut down for the rest of the day.

10:19.132 --> 10:21.235
I'll have to send over to Northville for what we need.

10:21.255 --> 10:22.016
Sir, wait a minute, Tom.

10:22.177 --> 10:22.597
Yeah?

10:22.617 --> 10:23.839
I've got an idea now.

10:23.899 --> 10:24.160
Well?

10:24.320 --> 10:25.442
I think you can fix that belt.

10:25.922 --> 10:26.543
How, Ranger?

10:26.744 --> 10:31.871
Well, now, all you need is some good, strong leather strips to lace those two ends of the belt together, right?

10:31.891 --> 10:33.814
Sure, sure, but that's what I've been talking about.

10:33.854 --> 10:34.916
But where are we going to get it?

10:34.936 --> 10:35.938
Now, wait a minute, Tom.

10:35.958 --> 10:36.238
Joe?

10:36.623 --> 10:37.104
Sam?

10:37.124 --> 10:37.965
Yes, Ranger Bill?

10:38.266 --> 10:40.350
Now, those boots you have on, they're pretty new now, aren't they?

10:40.570 --> 10:41.251
Good leather and all?

10:41.532 --> 10:42.494
Sure they are, Ranger Bill.

10:42.854 --> 10:45.619
And you can have them if it'll help you get the mill running again, huh, Sam?

10:45.719 --> 10:46.280
You bet.

10:46.461 --> 10:52.151
Well, we won't need the boots themselves, boys, but what Tom can use are those leather laces that you've got in your boots, you see?

10:52.692 --> 10:54.595
I'm pretty sure they'll do the trick.

10:54.615 --> 10:55.297
How about it, Tom?

10:55.537 --> 10:58.041
Just as a temporary repair job.

10:58.061 --> 10:59.244
Why, of course, Ranger.

10:59.444 --> 11:00.606
Now, tell me something.

11:00.873 --> 11:03.235
Why didn't I think of that?

11:03.255 --> 11:07.138
You can have mine just as soon as I can get them right out of my boots, Mr. Roberts.

11:07.198 --> 11:09.800
Well, you boys certainly come through in the clinches, all right.

11:09.820 --> 11:10.661
They certainly do, Tom.

11:10.741 --> 11:13.964
Hey, Bob, you, Jim, get going on this belt.

11:14.084 --> 11:15.465
Pull out those old laces.

11:15.565 --> 11:16.586
Some new ones are coming up.

11:16.646 --> 11:17.707
Here's mine, Mr. Roberts.

11:17.727 --> 11:18.308
And mine, too.

11:18.748 --> 11:19.449
Thank you, fellas.

11:20.109 --> 11:23.732
I'll see that you get new boot laces just as soon as I can break away from here.

11:23.752 --> 11:25.333
No, that's okay, Mr. Roberts.

11:25.353 --> 11:28.576
Well, Tom, it's unlikely that you'll have any more trouble with the mill today.

11:29.197 --> 11:30.778
I think we'd better be running along now.

11:31.180 --> 11:31.861
Good luck, Tom.

11:32.061 --> 11:34.705
Much obliged, Ranger, for everything.

11:34.725 --> 11:37.268
We'll have this mill going again in a jiffy.

11:37.308 --> 11:38.470
Thanks to you and the boys.

11:38.590 --> 11:53.390
We'll see you, Tom.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.633
Well, it's been a mighty full day, hasn't it, Joe?

11:56.033 --> 11:58.116
The storm that worked out with the sandbags...

11:58.248 --> 11:59.550
All that trouble at the sawmill?

11:59.710 --> 12:00.972
It's been swell, Ranger Bill.

12:01.352 --> 12:03.956
We've really got a story to tell back when we get back to camp.

12:03.976 --> 12:07.741
Well, maybe I can get your camp director to let you off on your dishwashing job tonight.

12:07.861 --> 12:08.983
Oh, don't do that, Ranger Bill.

12:09.383 --> 12:11.726
The dishes will be a cinch after what we've done today.

12:11.747 --> 12:13.108
Sam and I won't mind that at all.

12:13.269 --> 12:15.592
You know, Sam's been pretty quiet the last few miles.

12:16.113 --> 12:16.974
He isn't asleep, is he?

12:17.054 --> 12:17.434
Who, me?

12:17.575 --> 12:18.536
Oh, no, sir.

12:18.556 --> 12:19.457
Ah, there you are, Joe.

12:19.858 --> 12:21.660
I've been thinking about Smokey Ranger Bill.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.882
Oh, the little bear cub.

12:22.902 --> 12:23.623
We found the cave.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.043
Uh-huh.

12:25.185 --> 12:26.767
Well, I'll tell you what you do, you know.

12:27.368 --> 12:27.428
Ah.

12:27.678 --> 12:29.100
You think he'll be all right, Ranger Bill?

12:29.120 --> 12:30.722
I mean, will his broken leg heal all right?

12:31.704 --> 12:33.767
I'm pretty sure that Smokey will be okay, Sam.

12:34.288 --> 12:35.229
Say, I've got an idea.

12:35.269 --> 12:37.492
How would you two youngsters like to see Smokey again?

12:37.512 --> 12:38.534
Oh, gee, that'd be great.

12:38.574 --> 12:39.876
Okay, it's a date, then.

12:39.896 --> 12:43.120
You know, we'll go visiting Smokey and our wildlife area on your next day off.

12:43.541 --> 12:45.604
I think maybe June will be right along with us, too.

12:45.704 --> 12:47.567
Gee, that'll be swell, Ranger Bill.

12:48.729 --> 12:51.713
Well, there's your Pine Lake cap.

12:51.733 --> 12:53.696
I just want to tell you something, boys.

12:53.716 --> 12:55.879
For the way you pitched in today and the grand job you did,

12:56.669 --> 12:58.492
My hat's off to both of you.

12:58.512 --> 13:02.880
Golly, Ranger Bill, coming from you, that's a swell compliment.

13:02.900 --> 13:03.261
Thanks.

13:03.681 --> 13:06.346
Yeah, thanks a million, Ranger Bill.

13:07.748 --> 13:08.630
We'll be seeing you.

13:09.011 --> 13:10.694
Okay, be seeing you, boys.

13:10.914 --> 13:11.735
So long, Ranger Bill.

13:11.896 --> 13:13.058
Take good care of yourselves.

13:13.118 --> 13:15.522
Okay, thanks.

13:22.690 --> 13:41.393
Well, all's well that ends well.

13:41.913 --> 13:45.778
And Joe and Sam certainly deserve that nice salute from Ranger Bill.

13:46.568 --> 13:54.502
Next time, we'll join our friends out on the forest trail once again with Smokey Bear, the principal actor in an exciting adventure.

13:54.522 --> 14:00.673
Bill Scott, forest ranger, comes to you with the cooperation of the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture.

14:01.735 --> 14:06.022
Bill Scott is written by Bill Beroffen and produced for radio by Van Rensselaer Brokhahne.

14:06.603 --> 14:08.627
Your announcer has been Bob Geist.

14:08.627 --> 14:29.000
