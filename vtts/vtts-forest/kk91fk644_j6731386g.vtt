00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
[Silence]

00:10.000 --> 00:38.380
Hey!

00:38.380 --> 00:39.381
Thank you, boys, thank you.

00:39.762 --> 00:48.735
Well, friends, here it is once again, time for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads, just sitting here in the old pine tree, nothing else to do, so we thought we'd just stop by and play you a few tunes.

00:49.676 --> 00:52.219
We'd like to have you set a spell there and listen.

00:53.061 --> 00:59.029
We've got a few things here that we want to talk to you about and with and stuff and things, and

00:59.684 --> 01:02.289
You know, there's something I want to get off of my mind right now.

01:02.309 --> 01:05.234
You boys is always kidding me about not playing.

01:05.254 --> 01:06.396
You know, I can play more.

01:06.416 --> 01:06.737
I do.

01:06.797 --> 01:09.001
I play more music than all y'all put together.

01:09.602 --> 01:10.083
That's right.

01:10.224 --> 01:11.686
You don't believe it.

01:11.706 --> 01:13.690
Well, I got the biggest instrument up here, ain't I?

01:14.391 --> 01:15.353
I got the bull fiddle.

01:16.315 --> 01:18.679
I guess that takes care of that.

01:18.699 --> 01:19.060
Let's see.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.907
I believe Charlie Lush, you play a tune here on your steel guitty there.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.876
On this steel guitty, that's Charlie Tyler.

01:25.937 --> 01:27.221
He plays the steel guitar.

01:27.241 --> 01:34.062
He's going to play one here that we get lots of requests for from time to time, the old Steel Guitar Rag.

01:34.062 --> 02:55.447
[Music.]

02:55.447 --> 02:58.771
Thank you, Charlie.

02:58.831 --> 02:59.171
Thank you.

02:59.191 --> 03:00.873
I'm glad I got off of that in time.

03:00.913 --> 03:02.295
I finally just quit.

03:02.315 --> 03:09.243
You know, friends, I just wanted to just talk to you here just a minute about warming fires and campfires and things like that.

03:09.844 --> 03:12.047
You know, that's a dangerous thing.

03:12.787 --> 03:16.712
People don't stop to think just how dangerous warming fires and campfires are.

03:16.752 --> 03:21.758
They really set a lot of woods on fire with campfires and warming fires.

03:22.396 --> 03:28.683
He'd take a lot of fellas out there on the side of the highway early in the mornings, waiting on their riders to go to work.

03:28.723 --> 03:34.710
It's cold in the wintertime, and they're waiting there, you know, and they build up a fire.

03:34.730 --> 03:40.777
And then here comes along their rider, and they jump up and run, get in the car, and go off and leave the fire burning.

03:40.817 --> 03:41.718
That's bad business.

03:42.238 --> 03:42.839
Bad business.

03:42.859 --> 03:50.488
Because it don't take just a few leaves, and usually when it's cold, the leaves are falling, and he might have it cleaned off, pretty clean around there.

03:50.508 --> 03:51.829
But after he leaves a few...

03:52.163 --> 03:56.469
Goes on to work, a few leaves will fall off the trees, and the fire gets spread out there.

03:56.489 --> 04:00.274
Don't take but one leaf to do it, you know, and set the woods on fire.

04:00.294 --> 04:01.816
You can't be too careful with them.

04:01.936 --> 04:10.347
You kids out there, you little rabbit twisters, when you're sitting inside the road waiting for the school bus in the morning, you build your fire there to keep warm until the school bus gets there.

04:10.707 --> 04:15.173
Whenever you start, when you go to get on that bus, you just, that bus driver will wait for you.

04:15.394 --> 04:16.395
You put out that fire.

04:16.595 --> 04:18.778
Make sure it's taken care of before you leave.

04:19.096 --> 04:21.199
And he'll respect you for it, too.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.624
He'll really say, well, now, there's a kid that's really thinking ahead.

04:24.644 --> 04:25.706
That's a smart kid.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.208
I'll guarantee you that's what he'll say.

04:28.610 --> 04:30.112
And you take campfire.

04:30.192 --> 04:45.995
Now, everybody gets in that act, somewhere along the line, because I guess just about everybody, three-thirds of them anyhow, at some time or other, gets a chance to go out on the creek bank of fishing and build a campfire.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.297
That's something.

04:47.648 --> 04:53.479
Well, anyhow, I wanted to tell you a story about a fellow here that liked to burn himself up one time, but I'll tell you that in just a minute.

04:53.499 --> 04:56.325
Here's the first tune, and Slim's going to sing this one.

04:56.345 --> 05:01.935
It's called Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do.

05:02.877 --> 05:06.484
Well, why don't you love me like you used to do?

05:06.903 --> 05:09.708
How come you treat me like a worn-out shoe?

05:10.169 --> 05:13.174
My hair is still curly and my eyes are still blue.

05:13.675 --> 05:16.480
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

05:16.920 --> 05:23.652
Ain't had no loving like a hugging and a kissing in a long, long while.

05:23.672 --> 05:29.923
We don't get nearer for closer than a country mile.

05:31.034 --> 05:47.980
Why don't you spark me like you used to do? And say sweet nothings like you used to coo? I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through. Why don't you love me like you used to do?

05:47.980 --> 06:23.819
[Music.]

06:23.819 --> 06:28.564
Well, why don't you be just like you used to be?

06:29.225 --> 06:31.927
How come you find so many faults with me?

06:32.368 --> 06:35.171
Somebody's changed, so let me give you a clue.

06:35.711 --> 06:38.494
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

06:38.895 --> 06:45.622
Ain't had no loving like a hugging and a kissing in a long, long while.

06:45.642 --> 06:51.548
We don't get nearer for closer than a country mile.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.203
Why don't you say the things you used to say?

06:56.504 --> 06:59.587
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay?

06:59.747 --> 07:03.231
My hair is still kinky and my eyes are still blue.

07:03.251 --> 07:11.821
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

07:12.341 --> 07:15.845
Well, sir, had me fooled there for a minute, but that come out pretty good.

07:15.885 --> 07:16.606
That's Slim.

07:17.387 --> 07:17.867
That's Slim.

07:18.068 --> 07:20.510
A thousand and one watts during that tune.

07:20.550 --> 07:21.271
Why don't you love me?

07:21.491 --> 07:22.092
You know, I...

07:22.696 --> 07:25.380
I was thinking about this fellow that, like, burned himself up.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.783
It's kind of funny, but it's serious.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.286
It's really a serious proposition.

07:29.326 --> 07:30.788
I know this happened.

07:30.948 --> 07:32.731
I know this little incident happened.

07:32.831 --> 07:34.734
If y'all ain't doing nothing, friends, I'd like to tell you about it.

07:35.134 --> 07:37.838
This leatherhead was set down on the side of the road one morning.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.719
Early he was waiting.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.601
He was going to hunt.

07:40.162 --> 07:41.323
He had his two-hole gun.

07:41.343 --> 07:42.064
He was going to hunt.

07:42.685 --> 07:43.927
And he built a little fire.

07:43.947 --> 07:45.269
It was cold and dry.

07:45.790 --> 07:49.395
And he backed off there and built him a fire to warm him.

07:49.831 --> 08:00.063
And about the time he got the warming pretty good, but along comes the man he was going hunting with, so he just hopped in the car with him, and they drove on down through the woods there, and got down to where they was going to camp.

08:00.083 --> 08:04.167
They was going to stay a couple of nights down there and do some hunting.

08:04.187 --> 08:06.830
He never thought anymore about this little warming fire that he built.

08:06.850 --> 08:14.539
He just set a few little old twigs on fire there to kind of warm his toes, and they got out there and pitched their camp, set up the tent and everything.

08:15.059 --> 08:20.065
Build a campfire, as usual, that's about the first thing you do when you go out on a camp, you know, is build a campfire.

08:20.085 --> 08:23.208
And he built a fire there and set the coffee pot on, and they had coffee.

08:23.849 --> 08:29.635
So then they figured they'd go on off through the woods there and see if they couldn't kill some meat for supper, or dinner, rather.

08:30.056 --> 08:33.640
So they went hunting and never thought any more about it.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.505
Well, he was slipping along through the woods hunting, and he smelled smoke.

08:38.525 --> 08:40.948
And he didn't think much of it at first, but

08:41.300 --> 08:43.443
First thing you know, he could smell smoke stronger.

08:43.463 --> 08:46.768
And he looked up and the wind had come up and got started to blowing.

08:46.828 --> 08:49.352
And you know how wind will do sometimes.

08:49.392 --> 08:51.715
It'll come up in just a matter of a few minutes.

08:52.296 --> 08:54.619
And he looked and here come the fire.

08:54.639 --> 08:56.201
The woods was on fire.

08:56.362 --> 08:58.525
All ahead of him, the woods was just burning over.

08:59.105 --> 09:04.734
Well, he knew he had to get out from in front of that fire or either get his tail feathers scorched there.

09:04.754 --> 09:07.898
And so he taken off down through the woods.

09:08.283 --> 09:13.790
And he didn't go but a little piece till he run right into another fire.

09:13.810 --> 09:17.875
That poor man, he thought he was in an awful mess, which he was.

09:17.895 --> 09:20.217
He was in a tight spot, fire on both sides.

09:20.838 --> 09:37.378
Well, what actually happened, friends, is he went off out there in the woods hunting, and his fire that he had built to warm his toes, it got loose, and wind come up and come down through the woods meeting him, and the fire he'd gone off and left at the camp had done burnt up his camp, burnt up the tent and everything he had, and...

09:38.135 --> 10:06.825
had the woods all on fire and you know that man he was in the serious spot he finally just throwed down his gun and he had a new jacket and he wrapped up his head and all to keep from swallowing too much of the smoke and the blaze and all and he finally got out of the fire but he lost his gun and in the wrangle there he lost his gun and half of his belongings his coat and he had a serious accident there and

10:07.295 --> 10:11.260
Now, that's silly, that's plum silly, but that actually happens.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.523
You might be sitting there laughing about it right now.

10:13.543 --> 10:16.066
Well, it's kind of funny, but it's so true.

10:16.747 --> 10:19.451
And he burned up his hunting spot.

10:19.491 --> 10:21.013
He didn't have any place to hunt.

10:21.033 --> 10:22.274
He had to leave then.

10:22.795 --> 10:25.178
They would have run all the wildlife out.

10:25.198 --> 10:29.944
Burned up his camping equipment, along with all that little timber that he destroyed.

10:30.802 --> 10:31.983
You think about that, friends.

10:32.023 --> 10:33.545
Be careful with them fires out there.

10:33.565 --> 10:34.606
Here's the trio.

10:34.766 --> 10:36.567
All three of them is going to sing this next one.

10:36.988 --> 10:38.529
Meet Me Somewhere In Your Dreams.

10:45.796 --> 10:57.687
Softly tonight when the world is at rest, meet me somewhere in your dreams.

10:58.409 --> 11:22.273
Where lovers find only true happiness Meet me somewhere in your dreams. We'll take a trip in old memories here, Drifting down life's golden stream.

11:23.755 --> 11:29.612
I still have you and our old rendezvous.

11:30.354 --> 11:37.174
Lead me somewhere in your dreams.

11:37.174 --> 12:04.002
[Music.]

12:04.002 --> 12:28.592
We'll take a trip in old memories here, Drifting down life's golden stream. I still have you and our old rendezvous Meet me somewhere in your dreams.

12:29.011 --> 12:31.815
Well, all right there, boys, thank you.

12:31.835 --> 12:35.541
That was, friends, the three of them, three Knotheads, doing meet me somewhere in your dreams.

12:36.002 --> 12:38.265
Friends, the old clock on the walls caught up with us again.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.710
About everything we could do, it's caught right up with us, and we're going to have to shove off.

12:42.331 --> 12:46.137
But we've enjoyed sitting here under the old camp, the old pine tree with you.

12:46.157 --> 12:50.103
Here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave for you to think over and consider.

12:52.346 --> 12:58.275
Warming in campfires can be a lot of fun, but you don't forget to put them dead out

12:58.458 --> 12:59.760
when you're all done.

13:08.932 --> 13:11.255
Well, friends, we're going to have to go, but we'll be back with you.

13:11.816 --> 13:15.540
If you'll listen to your station announcer, he'll let you know the exact date and time.

13:16.301 --> 13:19.826
We'll be glad to come your way again here under the old pine tree.

13:19.846 --> 13:22.069
We'd like to have you listen.

13:23.112 --> 13:35.871
Friends, don't forget that this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service, with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:36.973 --> 13:43.042
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:44.044 --> 14:10.951
[Music.]
