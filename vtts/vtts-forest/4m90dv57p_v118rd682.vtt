00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
[Silence.]

00:06.916 --> 00:39.080
[Music.]

00:39.080 --> 00:40.121
That's right there.

00:40.141 --> 00:40.742
Thank you, boys.

00:40.802 --> 00:41.483
Thank you a lot.

00:42.524 --> 00:43.305
There it is, friend.

00:43.325 --> 00:43.746
Yes, sir.

00:43.866 --> 00:46.569
Once again, it's time for Jelly Elliot and the Three Knotheads.

00:46.709 --> 00:50.214
Come to you here sitting under the old pine tree just having a big time.

00:50.714 --> 00:58.684
We're really enjoying ourselves, and we hope that you'll come in and stay with us for this next few minutes here, and we'll try to show you a good time.

00:58.704 --> 01:01.087
Yes, sir, just showing our ignorance and having a big time.

01:01.127 --> 01:07.855
So just pull up a chair and sit down and relax there, and the boys and myself are going to dish out some of these old billy tunes here.

01:08.071 --> 01:10.244
Maybe you might hear one you'd like here.

01:10.606 --> 01:11.612
So don't tune us off.

01:11.632 --> 01:12.940
Stay there for just a few minutes.

01:13.383 --> 01:15.415
Here we go with the first tune that features Jack.

01:15.800 --> 01:23.352
This is Jack Youngblood with his cornstalk fiddle, with a tune that Jack has won a lot of popularity with.

01:23.452 --> 01:26.697
It's a tune called, Oh, Joe Clark, Jack!

01:26.717 --> 02:32.972
[Music.]

02:32.972 --> 02:36.612
Well, thank you there, Jack, old buddy.

02:36.992 --> 02:40.536
That was Jack Youngblood there, friends, and his fiddle to an old Joe Clark.

02:40.636 --> 02:43.519
That's a mighty fine care note.

02:43.769 --> 02:46.252
Friends, you know, Lewis has been working mighty hard.

02:46.272 --> 02:48.895
He's been backed off over in the corner writing him a poem.

02:49.877 --> 02:57.086
He's a poet in the aggregation, and he writes a poetry from time to time.

02:57.146 --> 02:59.709
He's got one here, friends, he said is really good.

03:00.330 --> 03:01.151
Are you ready, Lewis?

03:01.171 --> 03:02.352
I've been waiting a week, Jenny.

03:02.372 --> 03:03.774
Well, let's hear that poem.

03:03.794 --> 03:09.421
Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep and can't tell where to find them.

03:10.382 --> 03:13.506
That's because her old man's quit burning the woods

03:13.975 --> 03:22.091
And the grass is so good and the sheep are so fat that Bo Peep can't tell them from hogs.

03:23.193 --> 03:25.096
Let's give them a card in G there, boys.

03:25.858 --> 03:28.343
I declare that you tell that.

03:29.344 --> 03:31.268
Can't tell the sheep from the hogs.

03:31.829 --> 03:32.551
Lewis, come here.

03:32.891 --> 03:36.979
For your benefit and Bo Peep's benefit, don't you know the difference between the sheep and the hogs?

03:37.111 --> 03:44.019
A hog goes... That's a little hog, sir, not a big one.

03:44.039 --> 03:47.562
And a sheep goes... He's lost.

03:47.943 --> 03:49.725
That's an underfed sheep I'm talking about.

03:50.145 --> 03:55.751
You know, come to think of it, kind of on the serious side there, I believe he's got something.

03:55.771 --> 03:56.372
Sure do.

03:58.955 --> 04:01.478
Well, he has, just come to think of it.

04:01.498 --> 04:05.582
You can kind of change it around there and put it to suit yourself and all...

04:06.625 --> 04:13.195
you take there's still a lot of people that burns their pastures and places for their stock.

04:14.116 --> 04:16.079
Well, I wouldn't do it.

04:16.900 --> 04:21.867
I wouldn't burn even if I had a pasture and I had it full of stock.

04:21.887 --> 04:25.733
You burn your pasture over like that and you got a background there that's black.

04:25.753 --> 04:27.215
Black because it's burned over.

04:27.796 --> 04:33.344
Friends, you know the nation is going for better and bigger, fatter livestock.

04:33.444 --> 04:33.845
Every day.

04:34.045 --> 04:34.826
The whole nation.

04:34.946 --> 04:35.367
Not just

04:36.106 --> 04:39.592
the particular community where you live, but everywhere.

04:39.612 --> 04:44.580
People are trying to raise bigger and better cows and hogs and all that sort of stuff.

04:44.680 --> 04:50.109
So they've got into the thing of improved pasture.

04:50.129 --> 04:51.431
Improved pasture.

04:51.451 --> 04:52.633
Well, that's what they call it.

04:52.673 --> 04:59.825
But the thing is, just putting it mild, is they fence up their pasture and they keep fire out of it and they take care of it.

05:00.345 --> 05:02.569
Some of them sow grass seeds in there.

05:03.410 --> 05:07.516
Friends, you can drive down the highway and you'll see a pasture full of nice fat cattle.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.279
You think that over.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.862
Here's another tune here.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.466
And I guess I'm going to have to sing this one.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.489
Sure enough, I lost my go-ahead sheet here.

05:15.509 --> 05:16.951
Just a minute, I'll have it back over.

05:16.971 --> 05:17.873
There it is right there.

05:17.893 --> 05:18.494
Oh, I got it.

05:18.514 --> 05:19.796
I got it.

05:19.816 --> 05:20.517
I'll tell you the truth.

05:20.557 --> 05:21.558
I just can't sing a word.

05:21.618 --> 05:23.942
I sang by letter, friends.

05:23.962 --> 05:25.665
I'm sorry, but that's the way I sang.

05:25.725 --> 05:26.466
I sang by letter.

05:26.686 --> 05:27.508
Letter fly.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.129
And here it is.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.312
Where is your heart tonight?

05:37.143 --> 05:43.117
Where is your heart tonight?

05:43.137 --> 05:48.570
You look at me with eyes that do not see.

05:52.482 --> 06:13.748
Some love faith must have stole it from me Tomorrow you'll be different I'm hoping You let me know that everything's alright

06:14.403 --> 06:25.697
But now, though I'm holding you tight, I'm wondering, dear, where is your heart tonight?

06:26.018 --> 06:26.961
Well, Jack, boys!

06:52.237 --> 07:09.562
Well, you seem so strange tonight You pay no debt to anything I say Where is your heart tonight?

07:12.106 --> 07:18.295
It seems to be a million miles away

07:18.747 --> 07:37.735
Love words that I say don't seem to reach you You're in the little dream world of your own And now though I'm holding you tight

07:38.086 --> 07:45.653
I'm wondering, dear, where is your heart tonight?

07:45.673 --> 07:46.454
Well, there it is.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.455
Thank you, boys.

07:47.495 --> 07:48.456
Thank you a lot, friends.

07:48.476 --> 07:48.936
There it is.

07:48.996 --> 07:51.759
Where is your heart tonight?

07:51.779 --> 07:54.601
Yeah, that's a pretty nice tune there.

07:55.122 --> 07:56.143
I wish I could sing it.

07:58.465 --> 08:04.670
I was talking about burning over these pastures and things like that before I was so rudely interrupted by myself.

08:05.551 --> 08:07.553
But, you know, getting back to that point, friends,

08:08.292 --> 08:16.764
A lot of people still have the idea that they have to burn these pastures and grazing land for their cattle and sheep and what have you.

08:17.245 --> 08:21.611
I wouldn't do it myself, and I wouldn't advise you to do it.

08:21.631 --> 08:28.581
And then you take there's a lot of people that they want to burn their land over so their stock will have a place to graze.

08:28.601 --> 08:33.268
Well, that's all right if they want to burn theirs over and they see fit to burn it over.

08:33.608 --> 08:34.590
Well, that's their business.

08:35.111 --> 08:36.072
You go ahead and burn it.

08:36.845 --> 08:40.632
But the trouble is, a lot of them don't respect the property rights of the others.

08:41.954 --> 08:45.139
Now, you know, if you burn yours over, that's all right.

08:45.180 --> 08:46.923
You may see fit to burn yours.

08:46.943 --> 08:56.980
But maybe your neighbor over there, he don't want his burned, you see, and you're careless with it, and you let it get out over there into his pasture and burn his over, and he don't want to burn it over.

08:57.854 --> 09:08.603
Well, friends, just putting it mild in a way that everybody can understand it, it's the same thing if you'd go up to his house and just go on in the kitchen in there and get you a sack of flour and take it over to your house.

09:08.623 --> 09:17.090
It all adds up to the same thing because he probably has stock, too, or maybe if he don't have a short to his name, he don't want it burned.

09:17.110 --> 09:24.817
Maybe he's got a bunch of little bitty pine trees there that he wants to keep, don't you see, and start it into a forest.

09:24.837 --> 09:27.439
And maybe you don't even see them because they're not

09:27.875 --> 09:29.317
above the grass.

09:30.218 --> 09:33.122
So you just think about those things there.

09:33.142 --> 09:36.467
And after all, we're all in the same kittle, friends.

09:36.527 --> 09:39.171
We're all in the same pot, the same sack.

09:39.791 --> 09:42.736
Pull one of us out, we'll all fall out.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.097
We got to pull this thing together.

09:44.158 --> 09:49.885
You know, if we got a rope tied to a tree or a building or something, I'll go out there and I'll pull on the rope.

09:50.566 --> 09:52.028
And never could I break the rope.

09:52.649 --> 09:56.835
But I'll guarantee you, if all you guys will pitch in and help me, we all get a hold of that rope.

09:57.237 --> 09:58.098
We'll break her.

09:58.318 --> 09:59.459
Yes, sir, we can break it.

09:59.979 --> 10:03.563
And that is exactly what we've got to do, break the rope.

10:03.583 --> 10:08.727
We've got to break these fires in the woods and on this pasture land's north.

10:10.129 --> 10:12.290
There's nobody I don't care who he is.

10:12.310 --> 10:18.956
If he's never owned a calf in his life and he sees beautiful cattle outside the road, he'll take the second look.

10:18.976 --> 10:24.782
He might tell his wife, if he has a wife, ain't them pretty cows, just look, young, ain't that pretty, honey?

10:24.802 --> 10:26.383
I wish I had some of them.

10:26.870 --> 10:29.593
Yeah, everybody wishes they had some.

10:29.613 --> 10:32.057
Well, we better get into another tune here.

10:32.077 --> 10:34.660
So we're going to feature the steel man this time, Herman.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.441
Herman Popley.

10:36.042 --> 10:38.625
And Herman does a good job on this next tune, I think.

10:39.125 --> 10:43.591
So if you'll stick around there just a minute and see what you think about it, I believe you'll like it too.

10:43.611 --> 10:52.482
It's an old steel standard called the Texas Playboy Ride.

10:52.643 --> 10:54.565
Herman Popley

11:04.433 --> 11:08.807
I'll turn around!

11:38.167 --> 11:47.653
Oh, my God.

12:06.618 --> 12:10.583
Well, all right there, Herman.

12:10.603 --> 12:11.884
Thank you a lot there, buddy.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.327
That was mighty good steel playing.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.850
I really do like that.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.111
Friends, we've run out of time.

12:18.852 --> 12:22.897
The old clock on the wall says the knotheads and myself have got to get going.

12:22.917 --> 12:30.786
But before we go, here's just a little old thought, thought for the day, that I'd like to leave with you, and I do wish you'd think it over.

12:31.567 --> 12:32.848
Just kind of keep it in mind.

12:33.469 --> 12:34.330
Twist it around me.

12:35.272 --> 12:40.437
It's a good idea when you're burning for grass that the land you burn is your own.

12:41.678 --> 12:46.663
Because your fire and someone else's timber don't mix, my friends.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.946
And you'll reap whatever you've sown.

13:04.141 --> 13:05.262
Well, friends, there it is.

13:06.153 --> 13:13.326
Hester, brings to a close another little visit with you with the Knotheads and myself, Jelly Elliott and the Knotheads.

13:13.346 --> 13:18.936
Now, we've enjoyed sitting here under the old pine tree playing for you, and we hope that you've enjoyed it.

13:18.956 --> 13:20.278
We'll be back, too, friends.

13:20.359 --> 13:22.442
We'll be back to try to entertain you.

13:22.462 --> 13:28.954
If you'll listen to your local announcer, he'll let you know the exact day, time, and so forth and stuff and things.

13:30.082 --> 13:43.547
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:45.550 --> 13:50.740
Remember, friends, only you can prevent grass and woods fires.

13:50.740 --> 14:32.000
[Music.]

14:32.000 --> 14:42.000
[Silence.]
