00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
[Silence]

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
[Music.]

00:19.758 --> 00:27.488
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:27.889 --> 00:29.611
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:29.651 --> 00:31.974
That was how he got his name.

00:31.994 --> 00:32.896
Hi there, friends.

00:32.996 --> 00:35.740
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.103
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:38.123 --> 00:43.590
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:43.610 --> 00:45.493
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:46.594 --> 00:49.478
That's cause we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:50.572 --> 00:56.278
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:56.298 --> 01:03.124
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the Sons of the Pioneers.

01:03.144 --> 01:04.206
Hi, fellas.

01:04.226 --> 01:04.886
Well, hi, Billy.

01:05.507 --> 01:07.929
Will you just take a look at Dale Warren here?

01:08.290 --> 01:10.292
What are you looking so serious about, Dale?

01:10.872 --> 01:16.077
Well, his first song we're going to do, Over the Santa Fe Trail, makes a fellow think a bit.

01:16.097 --> 01:18.840
The days of moving to new settlements in this country are over.

01:19.428 --> 01:21.910
There are few lands left to conquer.

01:21.930 --> 01:25.614
So everyone has to do the best he can with the land he has.

01:25.634 --> 01:30.778
He's got to protect it, use it properly, respect the other fellow's land, too.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.781
Well, now that was spoken like a true philosopher, Dale.

01:34.021 --> 01:34.662
Let's sing, huh?

01:37.764 --> 01:48.574
There's an old prairie schooner When the next wave

01:49.195 --> 02:18.915
Over the Santa Fe Trail With its captain and crew Pushing on, going through Over the Santa Fe Trail Isle nearing 49ers

02:19.435 --> 02:23.460
Sailed away in mighty liners.

02:25.223 --> 02:32.472
Over the sagebrush sea.

02:32.492 --> 02:36.277
Sailed away to far off lands.

02:36.818 --> 02:40.683
Through the rolling burning sand.

02:42.926 --> 02:44.768
Out on the lawn.

02:49.270 --> 03:04.655
There's an old prairie schooner wending its way over the Santa Fe Trail.

03:06.898 --> 03:14.130
With its captain and crew pushing on going.

03:16.523 --> 03:26.014
Over the Santa Fe Trail.

03:26.034 --> 03:33.043
Anchors away at each break of day.

03:35.085 --> 03:41.252
Old Captain Kidd never did it that way.

03:41.873 --> 03:46.058
There's an old prairie schooner

03:47.253 --> 04:04.555
That was fine, fellas.

04:05.916 --> 04:14.647
While you were singing, I was thinking about what Dale Warren said about a man using his land properly and protecting it.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.129
You know, I grew up on a farm.

04:16.936 --> 04:24.226
We used to have a clean-up time in the spring and in the fall, working a little new ground and clearing up the brush here and there.

04:25.427 --> 04:32.977
I remember we used to get the neighbors in to help us, and then we'd help them, especially at burning time.

04:32.997 --> 04:43.872
Back of all this, of course, was the wonderful cooperation on all sides, cooperation in putting as much land as possible to good use, cooperation in protecting the land,

04:44.223 --> 04:49.690
and seeing to it that the brush fires didn't spread to the woods or into neighboring fields and woods.

04:50.952 --> 04:55.638
Most of the brush piles we'd burn right to the ground, watching them carefully all the way.

04:57.039 --> 05:06.391
And then I remember we'd leave one or two small ones standing, so the rabbits and sometimes even birds would have a kind of a winter refuge.

05:06.411 --> 05:11.698
How many times I've peeked into one of those brush piles, looking for Mr. Rabbit...

05:12.826 --> 05:16.954
Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Rabbit, your tail's mighty white.

05:17.896 --> 05:22.284
Yes, bless God, been getting out of sight.

05:23.006 --> 05:25.651
Every little soul gonna shine, shine.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.557
Every little soul gonna shine along.

05:29.298 --> 05:33.366
Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Rabbit, your coat's mighty gray.

05:33.802 --> 05:38.149
Yes, bless God, been out for a day.

05:38.890 --> 05:41.495
Every little soul gonna shine, shine.

05:41.515 --> 05:44.620
Every little soul gonna shine along.

05:45.421 --> 05:49.508
Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Rabbit, your ears mighty long.

05:50.329 --> 05:55.017
Yes, bless God, been put on wrong.

05:55.233 --> 05:58.017
Every little soul gonna shine, shine.

05:58.417 --> 06:01.161
Every little soul gonna shine along.

06:01.902 --> 06:05.907
Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Rabbit, your ear's mighty thin.

06:06.809 --> 06:11.134
Yes, bless God, been splitting the wind.

06:11.775 --> 06:14.419
Every little soul gonna shine, shine.

06:14.799 --> 06:17.723
Every little soul gonna shine along.

06:21.408 --> 06:21.949
I wonder...

06:22.368 --> 06:26.833
Does a rabbit hear a whistling sound when the wind blows past those long years?

06:28.335 --> 06:32.980
You know, it's the wind that usually stirs up trouble with brush fires.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.663
I know of one case that happened recently.

06:35.683 --> 06:40.389
A farmer left his brush fire in the field unattended for just a little while.

06:40.409 --> 06:43.632
The wind came up and blew sparks into a nearby haystack.

06:44.734 --> 06:52.122
From the haystack, the fire spread into the woods, destroying valuable timber, and before the fire was brought under control,

06:52.270 --> 06:55.134
it actually threatened the destruction of several communities.

06:56.497 --> 07:04.529
I'd like to pass on to you what the state and federal forestry boys prescribe as good safety rules in burning brush.

07:04.549 --> 07:09.076
Before I do that, however, here's some music, as only the Sons of the Pioneers can do it.

07:09.677 --> 07:27.235
[Music.]

07:27.235 --> 07:39.702
Who are the skies?

07:39.722 --> 07:44.653
Who are the signs of a night when

07:50.641 --> 08:00.756
Oh, Charlie, who are the hills?

08:02.438 --> 08:11.392
Who are the thrills of a nightbird calling?

08:12.013 --> 08:17.020
Every beating heart beats a rhythm that is blue.

08:17.405 --> 08:22.273
And the moon has cast a blue reflection in the dew.

08:23.154 --> 08:36.895
So the wind, while on its way, seems to cry and sigh and say, Blue.

08:36.915 --> 08:42.083
Blue prairie.

08:42.163 --> 08:43.345
Blue echoes ring.

08:46.852 --> 09:13.247
And the moon has cast a blue reflection in the dew So the wind while on its way seems to cry and sigh and say

09:26.255 --> 09:48.557
Blue Prairie.

09:50.379 --> 09:52.101
Now for those brush burning rules.

09:52.841 --> 09:53.562
Number one.

09:54.368 --> 09:59.435
Find out if your state laws require permits for burning brush or debris.

10:00.276 --> 10:03.541
If so, get one from your local fire warden or ranger.

10:04.142 --> 10:10.431
Number two, have plenty of health, plenty of tools and water handy.

10:10.451 --> 10:18.583
Number three, never burn slash leaves, grass, or brush in unusually dry, hot, or windy weather.

10:19.865 --> 10:20.886
That's it, friends.

10:20.906 --> 10:24.291
The ABCs of safety in burning brush or debris

10:25.756 --> 10:27.498
I'm sure a lot of you know this already.

10:28.118 --> 10:30.180
It's just a question of following through.

10:31.602 --> 10:43.253
I'm sure no one wants consciously to jeopardize or destroy the resources that give us so much in jobs, useful products, money, and beauty.

10:43.273 --> 10:50.580
Talking about beauty, let's listen to the Sons of the Pioneers just across the trail there.

10:50.600 --> 10:55.425
There's a rainbow over the rain

10:56.215 --> 10:59.640
And the skies are blue again.

10:59.660 --> 11:03.165
The rolling thunder spills in the far-off hills.

11:03.425 --> 11:06.229
There's a rainbow over the rain.

11:06.970 --> 11:13.920
Hear the cowboys, yippee-yo, while the dogees mill and moan.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.645
The sun is riding high in the prairie sky.

11:17.685 --> 11:20.890
There's a rainbow over the rain.

11:21.747 --> 11:27.654
I've been told there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow lane.

11:28.595 --> 11:35.904
But I found that trail just a magic veil that's born in the sun and rain.

11:35.924 --> 11:42.152
It's a grand and glorious day, and the clouds have rolled away.

11:42.873 --> 11:46.677
The fading thunder spills in the far-off field.

11:46.817 --> 11:50.742
There's a rainbow over the rain.

11:51.498 --> 12:09.962
¶¶

12:19.527 --> 12:25.894
I've been told there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow lane.

12:26.635 --> 12:33.943
But I found that trail just a magic veil that's born in the sun and rain.

12:34.103 --> 12:40.450
It's a grand and glorious day and the clouds have rolled away.

12:41.131 --> 12:44.995
The fading thunder spills in the far off hills.

12:45.035 --> 12:47.678
There's a rainbow over the rain.

12:48.603 --> 12:54.149
There's a rainbow over the rain.

12:55.551 --> 12:57.453
Well, look who's coming up the trail now.

12:57.973 --> 13:00.316
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

13:00.916 --> 13:05.642
He's the popular candidate, the people's choice for support this year and every year.

13:06.362 --> 13:09.686
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.348
Hello there, folks.

13:11.928 --> 13:16.213
I sure need your support in this campaign against forest fires.

13:16.430 --> 13:17.852
You farmers especially.

13:18.252 --> 13:24.681
You folks more than anyone else know what fire can do to the woods when it's allowed to run wild.

13:24.701 --> 13:27.424
I don't have to tell you how to burn brush.

13:28.165 --> 13:31.329
All I'm asking is that you never take a chance.

13:31.750 --> 13:34.954
Have plenty of help, tools and water handy.

13:34.974 --> 13:38.779
Please don't burn on dry, windy days.

13:38.799 --> 13:40.642
Well, I'll be seeing you.

13:41.543 --> 13:43.826
And there he goes down the trail.

13:43.846 --> 13:44.867
Thank you, Smokey.

13:46.045 --> 13:56.899
You know, friends, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:56.919 --> 14:09.175
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman and those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

14:09.195 --> 14:15.563
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest, woods, and range fires.

14:16.133 --> 14:25.153
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:25.173 --> 14:29.162
He can find a fire before he starts to flame.

14:29.483 --> 14:33.973
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:34.139 --> 14:38.248
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

14:39.070 --> 14:42.818
Prowlin' and the growlin' and the sniffin' the air.

14:43.459 --> 14:47.528
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

14:47.869 --> 14:52.519
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:52.519 --> 15:11.143
[Music.]

15:11.143 --> 15:25.000
[Silence.]
