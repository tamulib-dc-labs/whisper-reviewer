00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
[Silence.]

00:13.000 --> 00:22.000
[Music.]

00:22.000 --> 00:31.171
Once again, the Texas Forest Service brings you 15 minutes with Charlie Adams and his Western All-Stars.

00:31.191 --> 00:32.293
Howdy, friends and neighbors.

00:32.313 --> 00:38.442
This is John Scoggins, and here's Charlie and his gang with their brand-new Columbia recording dry in Texas.

00:40.852 --> 00:47.582
Gee, but it's dry in Texas, not a cloud in the sky in Texas.

00:48.563 --> 00:56.194
Although we drill for water, binding water's mighty part, we keep hitting our wells all over our backyards.

00:56.214 --> 01:03.805
Oh, gee, but it's dry in Texas, with the sun shining high to vex us.

01:03.785 --> 01:07.628
It hadn't rained in 20 years if you but knew the fact.

01:07.889 --> 01:11.392
So pity us poor Texans, we can't wash your Cadillac.

01:11.412 --> 01:15.055
My oh my, but it's dry in Texas.

01:15.716 --> 01:19.459
Every day it comes a duster, but it never ever rains.

01:19.799 --> 01:23.503
It's drier than a filibuster on them Texas plains.

01:23.743 --> 01:27.546
Oh gee, but it's dry in Texas.

01:27.566 --> 01:31.530
And the beat of the heat near wrecks us.

01:31.510 --> 01:35.218
When a little brother first felt rain, he fainted, and it's true.

01:35.638 --> 01:39.226
We had to throw sand in his face to bring that young'un to.

01:39.426 --> 01:44.777
My, oh my, but it's dry in Texas.

01:47.660 --> 01:50.544
Gee, but it's dry in Texas.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.710
Don't know why it's so dry in Texas.

01:55.591 --> 01:59.596
There's not a single blade of grass, but just a lot of sand.

01:59.616 --> 02:03.662
You never see a wetback, cause they walk the Rio Grande.

02:03.682 --> 02:06.826
Oh, gee, but it's dry in Texas.

02:07.547 --> 02:11.052
And the beat of the heat near wrecks us.

02:11.521 --> 02:15.586
When Ringling Brothers came to town, the heat was at its worst.

02:15.606 --> 02:19.250
The circus lost three camels, they just up and died of thirst.

02:19.290 --> 02:22.854
My, oh my, but it's dry in Texas.

02:23.635 --> 02:27.319
The plains were flat and dusty and the sand is smooth as silk.

02:27.699 --> 02:31.283
It got so dry that all the cows were giving powdered milk.

02:31.624 --> 02:34.707
Oh gee, but it's dry in Texas.

02:35.508 --> 02:37.410
It's so dry you could fry in Texas.

02:39.668 --> 02:43.393
Too darn dry for humans, rattlesnakes, or horned frogs.

02:43.854 --> 02:47.339
It even got so hot that all the trees were chasing dogs.

02:47.439 --> 02:50.764
My, oh, my, but it's dry in Texas.

02:51.104 --> 02:55.170
It's kind of dry.

02:55.190 --> 02:58.094
You know, Charlie, I got a confession to make here.

02:58.154 --> 03:01.339
I didn't used to care for Western music very much, but

03:01.842 --> 03:05.668
After hearing you play like that, well, I've decided that I was all wrong.

03:05.968 --> 03:06.889
Well, thank you, John.

03:06.909 --> 03:08.472
It is dry, isn't it?

03:10.174 --> 03:14.641
Well, it's kind of dry but mighty pretty, and I did like it.

03:15.201 --> 03:20.469
But there's one kind of music that I don't like, and that's the sound of a forest fire running wild.

03:20.489 --> 03:28.761
You know, each year the Texas Forest Service has a lot of trouble with wildfires, and a big part of this trouble comes from escaped field and brush fires.

03:29.230 --> 03:33.855
Last year about a third of the East Texas forest fires started from such burning.

03:34.736 --> 03:41.302
Many acres of our forest lands and ranges as well as fences and buildings are burned from this source.

03:41.322 --> 03:47.048
Now it may be that you folks listening are among the lucky ones who have never had any trouble like that.

03:47.068 --> 03:50.111
You know fires are tricky and they're hard to control.

03:50.131 --> 03:57.178
Some farmers have lost their barns or fences and homes in escaped field fires and the real tragedy of it is that

03:57.378 --> 04:02.183
Such losses are entirely unnecessary and can be prevented so easily.

04:02.203 --> 04:09.651
John, did you say that a third of the forest fires last year were caused by brush and grass fires just getting out of control?

04:09.851 --> 04:11.914
Well, not exactly, Charlie.

04:12.374 --> 04:17.720
I said from escaped field and brush fires, and that includes trash fires.

04:17.740 --> 04:25.208
Escaped fires usually mean someone was careless and didn't watch what they were doing, or they didn't take the proper precautions.

04:25.441 --> 04:36.458
Well, I thought you meant that the fire got too big and too, well, just too big to handle and got away from the one thing that was doing the burning.

04:36.498 --> 04:38.722
Yeah, well, that sometimes happens, too.

04:38.962 --> 04:44.811
And, Charlie, if you'll play us a tune, I'll tell you how easy it is to prevent those fires from escaping.

04:45.032 --> 04:51.702
Well, that's cheap enough to pay for such good information, so here goes with Kenneth Frazier on the guitar doing Country Gentleman.

04:51.702 --> 07:09.709
[Music.]

07:09.709 --> 07:19.206
Now neighbors we know there's going to be some field burning so I'm going to give you a few very simple suggestions

07:19.726 --> 07:23.511
to the people who feel that you've just got to burn your fields.

07:23.531 --> 07:26.955
And by following them, you'll at least keep the fires in your own property.

07:27.235 --> 07:28.737
That sounds like a good deal to me.

07:28.777 --> 07:30.619
At least they won't be burning out their neighbors.

07:30.719 --> 07:31.280
That's right.

07:31.380 --> 07:31.861
That's right.

07:31.901 --> 07:37.067
Now, the first thing is to plow at least a six-foot fire break all around the field that you're going to burn.

07:37.628 --> 07:43.555
And you'll probably be plowing this field later anyway, so that won't mean any extra work for you.

07:43.575 --> 07:49.682
Or if you prefer, plow two narrow lanes parallel with each other and carefully burn out the area between them.

07:50.135 --> 07:54.100
That way you'll have a wide firebreak that should stop the field fire.

07:54.961 --> 08:01.469
When you're burning, have plenty of tools handy, rakes, buckets, wet sacks, anything else that'll put out a fire.

08:01.489 --> 08:07.036
Be prepared so that you can protect your home, barn, fences, and other properties.

08:07.056 --> 08:09.278
Tell your neighbors you're going to burn your field.

08:09.299 --> 08:12.583
Maybe they'll want to help you too, and you can help them when they burn.

08:13.584 --> 08:18.690
Set your fire from the edges of your firebreaks and burn against the wind.

08:19.497 --> 08:25.826
Burn your brush in small piles and a few piles at a time and don't get too many going at once.

08:25.846 --> 08:29.191
And they're too hard to watch when you have too many piles burning at one time.

08:30.172 --> 08:34.618
And when you start your field or brush fire, never leave it unwatched.

08:34.638 --> 08:38.043
Stay with it until it's out, dead out.

08:38.063 --> 08:39.385
Don't burn on windy days.

08:39.465 --> 08:42.149
The safest time is late in the evening or at night.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.131
And don't take chances.

08:44.432 --> 08:45.353
It never fades.

08:45.552 --> 08:47.797
Say, that is good advice, all right.

08:47.817 --> 08:51.465
And now here's another tune to help pay... Well, it didn't pay you for it, John.

08:51.485 --> 08:52.387
We just hope it will.

08:52.427 --> 08:58.380
Anyway, here it is, our brand-new Columbia record, Waltzing With Sin.

08:58.380 --> 09:22.272
Someday you'll find that the world that you love, no true love knows nothing, just roaming about.

09:22.272 --> 09:29.059
While parting with people with a cold heart within.

09:30.240 --> 09:38.870
And while you are dancing, you'll waltzing with sin.

09:38.890 --> 09:46.097
You're Satan, made over in perfect disguise.

09:46.938 --> 09:48.820
Unfaithful, unfaithful, and oh so unwise.

09:54.318 --> 10:01.764
I pity the heart of the next guy you win.

10:01.784 --> 10:08.223
Like me, he'll be losing while waltzing with sin.

10:08.223 --> 10:44.692
[Music.]

10:44.692 --> 11:01.737
You're Satan made over in perfect disguise, unfaithful, unworthy, and oh so unwise. I pity the heart

11:01.737 --> 11:14.137
of the next guy you win. Like me, he'll be losing while waltzing with sin.

11:14.137 --> 11:16.621
All right, thank you, Charlie.

11:17.602 --> 11:24.372
Now for your neighbors living in one of the East Texas counties, please notify your district forester that you're going to burn.

11:25.213 --> 11:34.726
If you don't do this, one of our airplanes or towers will spot the smoke and you'll soon have a firefighting crew and equipment right there with you.

11:34.747 --> 11:38.592
Now this is an unnecessary trip and it costs you and other taxpayers money.

11:39.297 --> 11:46.050
So you'll be helping your neighbor, your community, your state, and yourself if you'll allow these few suggestions.

11:46.090 --> 11:47.973
Now, how about, Charlie, one more number?

11:48.013 --> 11:49.356
Well, John, what do you say?

11:49.376 --> 11:53.484
Let's get this steel guitar player, Lefty Mason over there.

11:53.544 --> 11:55.187
He's not doing much over there.

11:55.207 --> 11:55.808
So what do you say?

11:55.828 --> 11:57.812
Let's get him on this steel guitar rack.

14:20.960 --> 14:28.398
Charlie Adams and his Western All-Stars have been presented by the Texas Forest Service, a part of the Texas A&M College System.

14:28.999 --> 14:34.773
The program was written and produced by Chester O'Donnell and has been brought to you as a public service feature.

14:35.254 --> 14:37.399
Your announcer has been John Scoggin.

14:37.399 --> 15:08.000
