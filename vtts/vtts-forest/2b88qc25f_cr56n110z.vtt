00:17.767 --> 00:25.139
Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:25.159 --> 00:34.314
Today we present the final program in this series on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, forest ranger.

00:34.334 --> 00:37.860
Our scene is the little ranger station deep within the Beaver Dam Forest.

00:38.581 --> 00:44.871
It is here that Ranger Bill has asked Joe and Sam to meet him and his niece June on the boy's last day in the forest.

00:45.661 --> 00:50.208
As we join them, it's apparent that something exciting is in the air.

00:50.228 --> 00:53.994
Though he tries to hide it, Ranger Bill has a strange tenseness about him.

00:54.614 --> 01:02.667
His glance keeps darting out of the window toward the tops of the trees which are being whipped about wildly by a strong, unrelenting wind.

01:02.687 --> 01:13.403
Sitting at the Ranger Station radio with receiver wide open is the Beaverdam fire dispatcher, Mac, who listens quietly as Ranger Bill tells his young friends of the danger which faces the forest this day.

01:13.423 --> 01:14.284
I might as well tell you.

01:14.888 --> 01:17.971
forest and the air are very dry today, boys.

01:17.991 --> 01:20.955
We're up against what we might call a bad fire day.

01:20.975 --> 01:23.277
And that's why I asked you to meet me here.

01:23.297 --> 01:25.460
Yes, I'm standing by for anything that might happen.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.304
But, Ranger Bill, there's been no rain since that big storm we got caught in.

01:29.324 --> 01:30.986
And that means there's been no lightning either.

01:31.606 --> 01:33.068
I've always thought that lightning... Yes, I know.

01:33.088 --> 01:36.091
You've always thought that lightning causes most of our forest fires.

01:36.131 --> 01:36.752
Is that it, Joe?

01:36.872 --> 01:37.273
Yes, sir.

01:37.833 --> 01:40.476
Well, that's something you ought to get straight in your mind right now, son.

01:41.077 --> 01:43.039
Lightning is bad at times.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.444
especially in the West during the summer storms.

01:45.464 --> 01:46.546
But, now, get this.

01:47.107 --> 01:52.718
Lightning isn't responsible for more than one-tenth of all the forest fires we have in this country year after year.

01:52.738 --> 01:58.790
Golly, you mean that all the rest, nine out of every ten fires, are started by human beings like us here?

01:58.910 --> 01:59.611
That's right, Sam.

02:00.152 --> 02:03.559
Nine out of every ten forest fires are caused by man.

02:03.539 --> 02:07.187
And most of them start simply as a result of carelessness or thoughtlessness.

02:07.768 --> 02:10.353
Somebody tosses a lighted match or cigarette away.

02:10.694 --> 02:13.500
A camper leaves his campfire without being sure it's dead out.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.224
Things like that.

02:15.244 --> 02:17.208
Well, that's the sort of thing we're on guard against today.

02:17.228 --> 02:17.990
Devils, now fire.

02:18.010 --> 02:19.112
Look out to M5.

02:19.212 --> 02:20.154
Devils, now fire.

02:20.194 --> 02:21.216
Look out to M5.

02:21.277 --> 02:21.497
Come in.

02:22.608 --> 02:26.554
I know m5 back to devil's knob.

02:27.195 --> 02:38.693
I mean Bob Just found and gave me a reading I can give you his reading in mind, too, okay Let's have them Bob come in The reading from Hawk Tower is 10 degrees.

02:38.874 --> 02:40.296
Oh my reading is a hundred

02:45.811 --> 02:47.259
10 degrees from Hawk Tower.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.593
Your reading is 190 degrees.

02:49.613 --> 02:50.840
Okay, Bob, stay with it.

02:51.202 --> 02:52.449
M5 off.

02:52.469 --> 02:53.475
Devil's knob off.

02:54.569 --> 02:56.231
Let's have the location of that fire, Mac.

02:56.631 --> 02:57.732
Look what Mac's doing, Sam.

02:58.093 --> 02:59.955
He's working on that big map in front of him.

02:59.975 --> 03:00.415
Oh, I get it.

03:00.755 --> 03:02.577
The lookout towers are marked on the map.

03:03.038 --> 03:04.539
See, there's Hawk Tower.

03:04.559 --> 03:08.644
And Mac's drawing a line from the tower in the direction the lookout sighted the smoke.

03:08.664 --> 03:09.264
That's right.

03:09.625 --> 03:14.630
And now he's drawing a line from Devil's Knob in the direction that Bob was looking when he saw the smoke.

03:14.690 --> 03:16.872
Those were really compass readings Bob gave Mac.

03:17.052 --> 03:17.393
Sure.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.015
Don't you see where the two lines cross?

03:20.236 --> 03:21.897
That's where the fire must be.

03:21.917 --> 03:22.858
Well, there it is, Ranger.

03:23.099 --> 03:23.479
Yes.

03:23.881 --> 03:24.743
Yes, I see, Mac.

03:25.063 --> 03:29.272
The two lines of sight cross right there, just about in the center of the wildlife area.

03:29.312 --> 03:30.575
Just off Blackhawk Trail.

03:30.635 --> 03:31.577
Blackhawk Trail?

03:32.058 --> 03:34.282
Why, that's where we were last week, isn't it, Ranger Bill?

03:34.503 --> 03:35.345
Yes, Sam, it is.

03:35.365 --> 03:39.313
And Daisy, your old horse Uncle Bill, her pastor's in there somewhere.

03:39.433 --> 03:40.515
Say, that's right, Ranger.

03:40.696 --> 03:41.477
Daisy is in there.

03:41.517 --> 03:42.379
I know it, Mac.

03:42.359 --> 03:43.862
I've been thinking about Daisy.

03:43.882 --> 03:45.204
We've got to get her out somehow.

03:45.224 --> 03:47.368
I'll send the road crew to fight the fire, Ranger.

03:47.589 --> 03:49.993
Okay, but send some of our volunteer firefighters too, Mac.

03:50.494 --> 03:53.179
Since we're closer to the fire than anyone else, we'll leave from here pronto.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.461
Okay, boys, let's go.

03:54.481 --> 03:55.964
Uncle Bill, I want to go too.

03:56.385 --> 03:58.408
I won't get in the way, I promise.

03:58.428 --> 04:00.773
I'll carry water or messages, anything.

04:01.173 --> 04:02.997
Oh, please let me go, Uncle Bill.

04:03.077 --> 04:03.658
Well...

04:03.908 --> 04:04.710
All right, June.

04:05.111 --> 04:06.314
I believe you can't help it back.

04:06.655 --> 04:06.976
Come on.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.299
Come on, let's go.

04:08.320 --> 04:19.268
Come on, let's go.

04:27.145 --> 04:30.231
All right, boys, you can stop here.

04:30.271 --> 04:30.892
This is it.

04:30.912 --> 04:32.555
The fire's heading right toward us, Ranger Bill.

04:32.816 --> 04:33.437
What do we do?

04:33.617 --> 04:35.060
Well, let's size up things, first of all.

04:35.501 --> 04:36.984
Now, I want you to keep your heads, boys.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.927
Stay calm and don't get excited.

04:38.947 --> 04:40.230
Oh, we're not scared, Ranger Bill.

04:40.510 --> 04:41.252
Not with you here.

04:41.272 --> 04:41.733
Oh, fine.

04:42.154 --> 04:43.276
Now, here's the way it looks for me.

04:44.037 --> 04:46.622
We came here just about at the head or front of the fire.

04:47.193 --> 04:53.408
That's whipping along pretty fast, but if the wind doesn't get any stronger, we should be able to hold the fire until the other firefighters get here.

04:53.428 --> 04:55.052
What about Daisy, Uncle Bill?

04:55.072 --> 04:58.640
Well, that pasture of Daisy's is about a quarter of a mile behind us, June.

04:58.660 --> 05:01.126
But our first job is to try and stop this fire.

05:01.146 --> 05:02.670
If we do that, Daisy will be safe.

05:03.359 --> 05:05.103
The best way to bring her out is this way, you see.

05:05.584 --> 05:09.171
Now, Joe, you and Sam have those fire rigs I gave you, don't you?

05:09.191 --> 05:10.154
Well, we'll work together then.

05:10.434 --> 05:14.984
The fire hasn't jumped the trail, so we'll work away from the trail and try to keep the fire headed this way.

05:15.064 --> 05:15.906
What do you want us to do?

05:16.728 --> 05:19.714
I've got this water pump strapped to my back, so I'll go first, Sam.

05:20.032 --> 05:22.014
I'll spray water all along the front of the fire.

05:22.274 --> 05:24.937
That'll help cool it a bit, but it won't stop it.

05:24.957 --> 05:27.219
Now, you and Joe follow right close behind me, you got it?

05:27.739 --> 05:31.222
Break a line or path clear of all the needles, leaves, twigs, and everything else.

05:31.363 --> 05:32.504
How deep down, Ranger Bill?

05:32.524 --> 05:33.665
Well, right down to the dirt, Joe.

05:34.145 --> 05:37.148
What you and Sam have to do is cut off the fuel supply.

05:37.168 --> 05:41.692
The fire's feeding on leaves and twigs, you see, and if you take its food away, it's bound to die down.

05:42.813 --> 05:46.697
Lucky thing for us, though, it's still a ground fire and hasn't jumped up to the tops of the trees.

05:47.251 --> 05:49.836
Oh, a crown fire would be mighty bad medicine.

05:49.996 --> 05:52.160
What should I do with this canvas bucket, Uncle Bill?

05:52.180 --> 05:54.724
There's a little stream off there on the other side of the trail, June.

05:55.085 --> 05:57.890
I want you to keep this backpack pump of mine supplied with water.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.956
Now, don't try to carry too much at a time, but keep it coming.

06:01.957 --> 06:04.101
Keep your eyes on the fire and on the trail every minute.

06:04.121 --> 06:04.742
Do you hear, June?

06:05.163 --> 06:09.030
Now, if the fire jumps the trail, you race right back to us just as fast as you can.

06:09.050 --> 06:10.653
Oh, be careful, Uncle Bill.

06:10.673 --> 06:11.875
All right, fellas, let's go.

06:12.428 --> 06:13.989
The fire's right about up to us.

06:14.009 --> 06:16.011
Golly, this is hard work.

06:16.031 --> 06:16.331
Yeah.

06:16.992 --> 06:19.694
Oh, I'd like to get my hands on the guy who started this fire.

06:19.795 --> 06:29.003
On the way out here, Ranger Bill said it must have been some careless smoker... ...hacking along the trail... ...who tossed a lighted match or a cigarette down into the dry needles.

06:29.023 --> 06:31.425
The ranger's going to investigate when the fire's controlled.

06:31.485 --> 06:32.506
Less talking, boys.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.246
Save your strength.

06:33.266 --> 06:34.047
Yes, sir.

06:34.067 --> 06:36.009
You're doing a fine job, both of you.

06:36.029 --> 06:36.389
That's it.

06:36.449 --> 06:38.871
Now, make sure that you rake right down to the dirt, boys.

06:39.372 --> 06:40.613
You better go back a bit, Sam.

06:40.913 --> 06:43.039
Try to make you a fire line about two feet wide.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.945
We don't want the fire to jump over it.

06:45.025 --> 06:45.967
Okay, Ranger Bill.

06:46.349 --> 06:47.893
Hello, where are you?

06:47.913 --> 06:48.595
Over here, June.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.741
The wind's getting stronger, isn't it, Ranger Bill?

06:50.761 --> 06:51.824
It seems to be a bit.

06:51.844 --> 06:53.008
Here's the water, Uncle Bill.

06:53.028 --> 06:54.492
Well, you made it in good time, June.

06:55.013 --> 06:56.357
I've just about run out of water.

06:56.725 --> 06:59.008
Yeah, I'll kneel down to save you taking the pump off my back.

06:59.569 --> 07:01.511
You pour the water into the tank, you got it?

07:01.531 --> 07:02.453
All right, Uncle Bill.

07:02.653 --> 07:04.195
Now, you keep moving right along, boys.

07:04.556 --> 07:07.059
It's hot up against the fire, I know, but stay with it.

07:07.079 --> 07:07.880
Okay, Ranger Bill.

07:08.441 --> 07:10.664
Oh, I'm worried about Daisy, Uncle Bill.

07:10.684 --> 07:12.326
Why doesn't that fire still get here?

07:12.346 --> 07:13.748
We should be here soon, June.

07:13.768 --> 07:16.692
Won't Daisy be fighting, Uncle Bill, with the smoke and all?

07:16.712 --> 07:19.035
Danger is no stranger to fire this day, Daisy.

07:19.476 --> 07:22.259
Don't forget that she carried me to lots of them in the old days.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.943
No, I'm counting on Daisy not to get too scared.

07:25.092 --> 07:27.056
But more than Daisy is at stake here, my dear.

07:27.316 --> 07:27.797
I know.

07:27.837 --> 07:32.826
The young trees and the soil, food for the animals and their homes, going up in smoke.

07:33.408 --> 07:36.253
Oh, forest fires are terrible, aren't they, Uncle Bill?

07:36.333 --> 07:37.135
Yes, June, they are.

07:37.475 --> 07:41.683
So unnecessary when you realize that just a moment's care could prevent this sort of thing.

07:42.085 --> 07:42.505
There.

07:42.926 --> 07:44.588
I've poured in all the water, Uncle Bill.

07:44.768 --> 07:45.949
I'm going after some more.

07:45.969 --> 07:47.310
Now be very careful, June.

07:47.350 --> 07:47.731
Remember.

07:47.751 --> 07:48.572
I'll be all right.

07:48.732 --> 07:50.494
Don't worry, Uncle Bill.

07:50.514 --> 07:51.114
I'll take care of myself.

07:51.134 --> 07:52.195
Look back there, Ranger Bill.

07:52.435 --> 07:53.176
Toward the trail.

07:53.436 --> 07:55.058
The fire's jumped across the trail now.

07:55.118 --> 07:56.800
June's over that way, isn't she, Ranger Bill?

07:56.820 --> 07:56.980
Come on.

07:57.000 --> 07:57.280
Hurry.

07:57.721 --> 07:58.722
Bring your tools.

07:58.742 --> 07:59.543
Okay.

07:59.563 --> 07:59.763
June.

08:00.384 --> 08:01.224
June, where are you?

08:01.244 --> 08:02.406
Go on and find her, Ranger Bill.

08:02.586 --> 08:04.007
We'll stay here and fight the fire.

08:04.328 --> 08:05.168
No, Sam.

08:05.188 --> 08:06.810
I'm sure June saw the break over.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.693
She must have headed further back into the forest.

08:09.014 --> 08:11.177
Now, what we have to do is stop the spread of this fire.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.823
We've got to get both sides of the trail to work on now.

08:15.384 --> 08:16.566
Can you boys stay with it a while?

08:16.606 --> 08:17.548
You bet, Ranger Bill.

08:17.808 --> 08:19.310
You're doing a swell job, boys.

08:19.451 --> 08:22.516
Where are those firefighters that Mac was sending in here, Ranger Bill?

08:22.996 --> 08:24.118
When are they going to get here?

08:24.218 --> 08:25.621
They had a long way to come, Sam.

08:26.101 --> 08:28.205
Here, let me take your rake a minute, boy.

08:28.225 --> 08:29.447
I'm almost out of water anyway.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.330
I'll give you a rest.

08:31.350 --> 08:32.612
That's all right, Ranger Bill.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.991
I can keep on raking and... Hello!

08:36.011 --> 08:37.073
Yo, Ranger!

08:37.414 --> 08:38.236
Ranger!

08:38.256 --> 08:39.738
Hey, it's your fire crew, Ranger Bill.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.281
They've come, they've come.

08:41.301 --> 08:42.283
Right there, over this way.

08:42.604 --> 08:43.085
Over here.

08:43.305 --> 08:43.786
Oh, boy.

08:44.026 --> 08:44.668
Here they come.

08:45.068 --> 08:46.411
Right through the burn plate.

08:48.475 --> 08:50.519
Mike, what are you doing here?

08:50.539 --> 08:52.182
I hope you don't mind me.

08:52.202 --> 08:55.528
Far above the devil's house said this fire was spreading all over the country.

08:55.711 --> 08:57.754
Well, I was worried about you and Daisy.

08:57.774 --> 08:59.416
Also, the rest of the forest is clear.

08:59.997 --> 09:03.402
No other fire anywhere, so I left one of the guards at the station and joined the crew.

09:03.562 --> 09:04.123
Okay, Mac.

09:04.643 --> 09:06.686
Now, this fire's got a big spread, huh?

09:06.706 --> 09:08.208
About how far back would you say?

09:08.228 --> 09:10.611
It's well into the section where Daisy's pasture is, Ranger.

09:10.992 --> 09:12.274
I was hoping you'd get her out by now.

09:12.414 --> 09:13.155
Poor Daisy.

09:13.475 --> 09:15.077
We had our hands full right here, Mac.

09:15.378 --> 09:16.479
Where's your niece, Ranger Bill?

09:16.740 --> 09:17.741
She came out here with you.

09:17.761 --> 09:18.783
I'm not sure, Mac.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.326
Back of her somewhere in the unburned area, I think.

09:22.087 --> 09:23.048
I'm going to look for her now.

09:23.649 --> 09:24.250
All right, men.

09:24.584 --> 09:25.806
We'll split the crew right here.

09:26.186 --> 09:27.849
Work both ways against the fire.

09:27.869 --> 09:28.570
You got it?

09:31.634 --> 09:31.994
Wait a minute.

09:32.455 --> 09:33.116
All of you.

09:33.136 --> 09:33.517
What's that?

09:33.537 --> 09:34.498
It's June Ranger, Bill.

09:34.758 --> 09:36.381
It's June and she's riding Daisy.

09:36.601 --> 09:37.162
Good girl.

09:37.662 --> 09:38.363
Good girl.

09:40.186 --> 09:42.028
Hello, Uncle Bill.

09:42.048 --> 09:42.589
Hello, everybody.

09:42.629 --> 09:43.611
Oh, sorry, Uncle Bill.

09:43.631 --> 09:44.912
I hope you don't mind what I say.

09:44.953 --> 09:45.333
Mind?

09:45.754 --> 09:47.436
I bless your heart, June.

09:47.416 --> 09:49.139
You've saved the day, that's what you've done.

09:49.460 --> 09:51.023
Getting yourself and Daisy out this way.

09:51.464 --> 09:52.887
I saw the fire jump the trail.

09:53.227 --> 09:55.572
And before I knew it, it was heading right for me.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.916
So I dropped the bucket and ran and ran.

09:58.277 --> 10:01.684
And before I knew it, I was at the pasture and there was Daisy.

10:01.844 --> 10:05.070
The fire was beginning to burn the fence on the other side of the pasture.

10:05.050 --> 10:07.994
So I let Daisy out and got on her back and rode this way.

10:08.415 --> 10:11.119
I knew I'd find you in here where the fire hadn't reached yet.

10:11.139 --> 10:13.122
And well, oh, here we are.

10:13.302 --> 10:17.067
All right, get to work, men.

10:17.808 --> 10:27.522
Let's put this fire up.

10:28.764 --> 10:34.973
All right.

10:42.665 --> 10:45.028
Oh, quiet, baby.

10:45.388 --> 10:47.230
Everything's all right now.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.032
Fire's out, back on the road.

10:49.392 --> 10:51.094
Just about ready to head for home again.

10:51.455 --> 10:54.798
Joe and I, we're ready to head for home too, Ranger Bill.

10:55.579 --> 10:57.421
The camp bus will be waiting for us.

10:57.902 --> 11:01.726
We don't know how to say it, Ranger Bill, but, well, it's been swell knowing you.

11:02.447 --> 11:03.188
You too, June.

11:03.448 --> 11:07.392
Golly, we've learned so much here in Beaver Dam Forest and all.

11:07.773 --> 11:11.777
Look, fellas, I reckon we all feel the same way about this.

11:12.736 --> 11:15.720
There's really no need to say anything.

11:15.740 --> 11:16.861
Let me shake your hand, Sam.

11:18.343 --> 11:19.024
Yours too, Joe.

11:20.366 --> 11:20.466
Okay.

11:20.486 --> 11:20.706
There.

11:22.469 --> 11:24.812
All right, now, get going before you miss your bus now.

11:24.992 --> 11:25.953
Goodbye, Joe.

11:26.614 --> 11:27.696
Goodbye, Sam.

11:27.736 --> 11:28.617
Goodbye, Ranger Bill.

11:29.278 --> 11:29.979
Goodbye, Ranger Bill.

11:29.999 --> 11:30.720
So long, fellas.

11:31.180 --> 11:32.202
Have a nice trip home, will you?

11:32.222 --> 11:33.363
We'll write to you, Ranger Bill.

11:33.964 --> 11:34.705
Honest, we will.

11:34.745 --> 11:35.927
Sure, you keep in touch with me.

11:36.047 --> 11:36.487
Don't forget.

11:36.928 --> 11:37.569
So long, boys.

11:37.649 --> 11:38.910
So long.

11:39.211 --> 11:40.853
Oh, jeepers, Uncle Bill.

11:41.002 --> 11:42.324
Aren't they swell?

11:42.584 --> 11:43.666
They're good boys, all right.

11:44.727 --> 11:45.709
You want to know something, June?

11:45.909 --> 11:46.630
What, Uncle Bill?

11:47.571 --> 11:54.141
Well, I hope that you and Joe and Sam really have learned something about forest conservation.

11:54.161 --> 12:01.591
You know, it seems to me, June, that American youngsters have a real responsibility in protecting and keeping our forests and woodlands growing.

12:02.572 --> 12:05.517
They ought to realize how important our forests are to all of us.

12:06.177 --> 12:07.279
In fact, to each one of us.

12:08.153 --> 12:18.711
American boys and girls have such a big stake in our God-given natural resources that they ought to do everything in their power to safeguard them against all their enemies, natural and human alike.

12:19.813 --> 12:25.002
And that goes for all the Joes and Sams and Junes in this wonderful country of ours.

12:25.022 --> 12:26.464
I know what you mean, Uncle Bill.

12:28.367 --> 12:29.549
Okay, Daisy.

12:29.569 --> 12:31.813
We're going home now, too.

12:31.833 --> 12:32.254
Come on.

12:41.127 --> 13:05.835
And so we conclude this series of programs on forest conservation featuring Bill Scott, forest ranger.

13:06.794 --> 13:13.423
