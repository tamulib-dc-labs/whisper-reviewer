00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
[Silence.]

00:07.000 --> 00:35.047
[Music.]

00:35.047 --> 00:36.690
Thank you, boys.

00:36.710 --> 00:37.130
Thank you.

00:37.411 --> 00:38.112
Howdy, friends.

00:38.212 --> 00:38.513
Let's see.

00:38.533 --> 00:42.439
Here it is again at your old woods rider, Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads.

00:42.820 --> 00:53.477
We're going to be with you here for a spell, so just pull up a pine knot and sit down there and try to make yourself comfortable and take it to the backer and enjoy things for a spell here.

00:53.778 --> 00:59.826
Yeah, this is a new series of, it's a new series, that's what it is, and we want all of you to listen.

00:59.886 --> 01:03.431
We might say or do something here that you'd like, and you wouldn't want to miss it.

01:03.751 --> 01:19.132
Just relax there, and while the boys and myself whip up a few of these old corny hillbilly tunes, and we got a few things here we want to discuss with you about the woods in general, and the forest, and stuff like that, you know, woods.

01:19.533 --> 01:22.857
We all woods, country boys, live out in the woods, and

01:23.377 --> 01:25.580
and therefore we can talk about woods.

01:25.600 --> 01:32.448
And don't forget, friends, this program is brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your state forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service.

01:32.468 --> 01:34.050
Here's the first tune, features Robert.

01:34.391 --> 01:38.956
The boy with the fiddle, that is, some people plays a violin, Robert plays a fiddle.

01:39.277 --> 01:47.727
He plays an old hoedown called Old Joe Clark.

01:47.747 --> 02:58.433
[Music.]

02:58.433 --> 03:01.116
Well, thank you, Robert.

03:01.136 --> 03:01.497
Thank you.

03:01.517 --> 03:04.160
You know Robert really plays that new fiddle, don't he?

03:04.180 --> 03:05.361
He's getting better all the time.

03:05.421 --> 03:07.103
I believe he'll eventually learn.

03:07.123 --> 03:08.365
Robert's got a new fiddle.

03:08.405 --> 03:13.631
He's been selling garden seeds around through the country and got him a brand new fiddle.

03:13.651 --> 03:17.435
Oh, yeah, I guess I better tell you all about these knotheads, tell you who they are.

03:18.276 --> 03:22.922
Well, I'll start out with Robert and his new, let's see, flower seed fiddle.

03:23.022 --> 03:24.023
Robert Shivers.

03:24.063 --> 03:25.825
Give me a note on that new fiddle, Robert.

03:27.543 --> 03:28.824
Is that what that was, a note?

03:30.566 --> 03:32.447
I'm telling you, that is awful, ain't it?

03:32.487 --> 03:33.528
That's pitiful.

03:33.548 --> 03:36.171
Well, then we'll take the steel man over here.

03:36.191 --> 03:47.661
I'm telling you, friends, that boy has got, that thing is standing up on three legs, and he's got two or three steel bars there and a handful of picks, and it's a three-barrel rig.

03:47.681 --> 03:48.782
That's what it is.

03:48.842 --> 03:51.204
It's got three nets.

03:51.224 --> 03:56.049
I don't know how in the world that boy managed to buy all the strings that goes on that thing, but he's up here.

03:56.129 --> 03:57.010
It's Charlie Tyler.

03:57.030 --> 03:57.550
Charlie?

03:59.707 --> 04:01.290
All aboard for all points south.

04:01.350 --> 04:02.733
Now, here he is.

04:03.815 --> 04:04.977
Oh, boy, old Shorty.

04:05.237 --> 04:05.999
Shorty Slim.

04:06.299 --> 04:08.363
It's Slim Watts, 1,001 Watts.

04:08.383 --> 04:08.724
Slim.

04:10.908 --> 04:12.872
That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

04:12.892 --> 04:14.375
Yeah, I kind of like that.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.677
Tell you what we'll do, Slim.

04:15.717 --> 04:17.260
How about unless you sing a song?

04:17.560 --> 04:19.002
We'll get Slim to sing a song.

04:19.302 --> 04:31.479
You know, friends, before Slim sings this song, I just wanted to tell you that, as I've already told you before, this is a new series of programs featuring stories about the woods and outdoors and things like that.

04:31.519 --> 04:36.086
You know, I'd look terrible down there in the bank trying to talk to a banker because I don't know nothing about banking.

04:36.526 --> 04:40.592
But I do live out in the woods, and I can talk to you about the woods and the forest and all that.

04:40.632 --> 04:44.918
I know a pine tree from an ellum and a sass-grass and all that, you know, and

04:45.320 --> 04:47.483
Have to drink that satchafras tea every spring.

04:47.523 --> 04:49.847
Yeah, I know the woods, and I'm going to tell you.

04:49.867 --> 04:51.149
You know, I live out in the woods.

04:51.169 --> 04:51.730
That's the truth.

04:51.850 --> 04:52.651
But I've been around.

04:52.691 --> 04:53.652
I've been a few places.

04:54.113 --> 04:57.298
Yeah, I've been to Forest Wham, and I've been to Gorham.

04:58.239 --> 05:00.403
Gorham, that reminds me.

05:00.423 --> 05:00.983
Yeah, Gorham.

05:01.504 --> 05:03.006
Yeah, I knew a man from Gorham.

05:03.527 --> 05:05.430
He bought a pair of pants, and he wore them.

05:06.071 --> 05:10.678
He stooped and laughed and felt a draft, and he knew right where he tore them.

05:10.698 --> 05:11.479
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

05:11.830 --> 05:14.813
I've been around, but I want to tell you what I saw the other day.

05:14.833 --> 05:23.183
Before I tell it, though, here's Slim, that long, ichibod-crane-disconnected-looking fellow with one of Red Foley's tunes called Cincinnati Dancing Pig.

05:23.183 --> 05:35.396
[Music.]

05:35.396 --> 05:40.842
Cincinnati's dancing pig, He's the barnyard, Mr. Big.

05:41.294 --> 05:46.805
Cincinnati's dancing pig with his riggedy-jig, jiggedy-jig, jigga-jig-jig.

05:46.846 --> 05:53.159
Children yell and clap and sing when he does his buck and wink.

05:53.840 --> 05:59.372
Cincinnati's dancing pig with his riggedy-jig, jiggedy-jig, jigga-jig-jig.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.458
Dancing bears and kangaroos.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.295
Have the lot on the ball.

06:05.656 --> 06:11.602
But until you've seen this remarkable pig, you ain't seen nothing at all.

06:12.743 --> 06:18.369
From Duluth to Birmingham, say, he's the pork chop dapper Dan.

06:18.989 --> 06:24.275
But he's the keenest hog, what I am, Cincinnati dancing pig.

06:24.575 --> 06:27.358
With his riggedy jig, jiggy jig, jig.

06:27.358 --> 07:05.847
[Music.]

07:05.847 --> 07:08.233
Cincinnati's dancing pig.

07:08.894 --> 07:11.377
He's the barnyard, Mr. Big.

07:12.038 --> 07:14.502
Cincinnati's dancing pig.

07:14.522 --> 07:18.347
With his riggedy jig, jiggedy jig, jigga, jig, jig.

07:18.567 --> 07:21.551
Children yell and clap and sing

07:21.571 --> 07:24.075
When he does his buck and wing.

07:24.716 --> 07:27.199
Cincinnati's dancing pig.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.023
With his riggedy jig, jiggedy jig, jigga, jig, jig.

07:30.560 --> 07:36.530
Dancing bears and kangaroos have a lot on the ball.

07:36.730 --> 07:42.620
But until you've seen that remarkable pig, you ain't seen nothing at all.

07:43.702 --> 07:49.412
From Duluth to Birmingham, say, he's the pork chop dapper dance.

07:49.831 --> 07:55.257
But he's the keenest hog, what I am, Cincinnati's dancing pig.

07:55.637 --> 08:00.823
With his riggity-jig, jiggy-jig-jig.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.164
Thank you, Slim, thank you.

08:02.184 --> 08:04.667
There it is, friends, Cincinnati's dancing pig.

08:05.828 --> 08:08.231
Friends, you know, timber is just like steel.

08:08.471 --> 08:12.215
And coal and oil and gas and all that sort of stuff.

08:12.235 --> 08:16.940
Now, it's a material, and it's a material that our nation needs a lot of.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.062
In fact, we couldn't have too much.

08:19.936 --> 08:21.357
but we don't have enough.

08:22.018 --> 08:24.040
We need it for war and for peace.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.621
We need it all times.

08:25.861 --> 08:27.022
Everybody needs it.

08:27.342 --> 08:28.904
Just can't do without it.

08:28.924 --> 08:32.327
We need the woods and the forest to have more of this lumber.

08:32.347 --> 08:33.188
Got to have more.

08:33.788 --> 08:34.969
And other wood products.

08:36.430 --> 08:40.554
Oh, I could stand up here and talk for two days and couldn't mention all of them.

08:40.574 --> 08:42.356
It's a mighty important thing, friends.

08:43.116 --> 08:46.739
I'll tell you, you just got to realize it and think more about it.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.622
Because in war alone,

08:49.822 --> 08:58.113
In war alone, this last world war, it took 1,500 board feet of lumber just to house every fighting man that went overseas.

08:58.453 --> 08:59.615
Friends, can you imagine that?

08:59.635 --> 09:01.758
1,500 board feet.

09:01.778 --> 09:02.439
Well, that's right.

09:02.639 --> 09:05.002
That's government figures on that.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.664
And that's how much it takes.

09:07.125 --> 09:12.692
You wouldn't want him to have to sleep out in the rain, stay out of doors and all, would you?

09:13.233 --> 09:16.618
Well, there's one way you can help, and that's to help protect the forest and woods.

09:16.698 --> 09:17.719
Keep the timber growing.

09:18.830 --> 09:26.441
A forever man that went overseas in World War II, it took 300 board feet of lumber to box up his supplies.

09:26.921 --> 09:31.307
His shooting arms and things, and his skillet, and tin cup, and all that stuff.

09:31.808 --> 09:33.370
That's right, 300 board feet.

09:33.390 --> 09:34.832
You know what a board foot is, don't you?

09:34.852 --> 09:35.994
Well, that's a foot of board.

09:36.134 --> 09:38.518
I mean, no, wait, that's a, well, it's a chunk.

09:38.538 --> 09:40.380
It's a piece of lumber.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.884
It's a, well, I'll tell you what it is.

09:43.465 --> 09:44.366
I know, don't I?

09:44.386 --> 09:45.628
Sure I know, yeah, yeah.

09:45.748 --> 09:46.609
Don't you know, Slim?

09:46.949 --> 09:47.310
You know?

09:47.690 --> 09:48.111
Huh?

09:48.563 --> 09:49.064
You do.

09:49.084 --> 09:50.405
Everybody knows?

09:50.465 --> 09:51.246
You sure you know?

09:52.588 --> 09:52.948
I know.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.210
I know I know.

09:54.490 --> 09:54.830
Let's see.

09:54.891 --> 10:02.159
A board foot is a board 12 inches wide, 12 inches long, and 1 inch thick.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.322
That's what it is.

10:04.802 --> 10:05.643
Thought I didn't know.

10:06.785 --> 10:07.726
That's what it is, friends.

10:07.746 --> 10:13.753
But it's taken 300 board feet of lumber for every box that crated up these soldier supplies.

10:13.773 --> 10:16.176
It took 50 board feet a month.

10:16.196 --> 10:16.697
Now think of that.

10:16.737 --> 10:17.878
50 board feet a month.

10:18.567 --> 10:29.624
After they got him overseas to keep him supplied that they send his groceries to him and all he took that much Now did you ever stop thinking that I didn't I'll be honest with mine.

10:29.684 --> 10:30.966
I'll be plain and frank.

10:30.986 --> 10:46.009
I never thought of that But that's that's what it takes Now we need lots more pulpwood There's a lot of sections of the country where we have pulpwood trees I mean pulp mill wood paper mills no and

10:46.327 --> 10:47.449
We need a lot more of that.

10:47.489 --> 10:53.158
That plays an important part in the powder that goes into the rifle ammunition and stuff like that.

10:53.518 --> 10:54.359
Oh, friends, that's right.

10:54.399 --> 10:56.683
It takes plenty of wood for war, all right?

10:56.723 --> 11:12.267
But we need our forests for other things, too, to protect the soil, to keep down erosion and floods for the wild animals, birds and fish and all that sort of stuff, fishing and hunting and picnicking and fish for food and all that sort of stuff.

11:12.837 --> 11:17.803
And then I'll just tell you, we just need our forest.

11:18.264 --> 11:20.707
Our country needs our woods and forest.

11:20.727 --> 11:23.991
The nation's strength and well-being depends a lot on it.

11:24.011 --> 11:27.736
Now, we just got to take care of them and protect them and keep them green and growing.

11:27.996 --> 11:28.937
And everybody can help.

11:29.598 --> 11:32.522
Now, here's Charlie to do the next tune on his steel giddy.

11:32.882 --> 11:35.706
Here, he's going to do a little tune called Panhandle Rag.

11:35.706 --> 12:18.000

12:18.000 --> 12:22.777
Well, old Panhandle Rag, there it is, friends.

12:22.797 --> 12:24.559
We hope that you've all enjoyed that.

12:25.060 --> 12:26.382
Panhandle Rag.

12:26.402 --> 12:28.845
Now here is just a little thought for the day.

12:29.213 --> 12:30.536
that I'd like to leave with you.

12:31.197 --> 12:38.493
When they cut off Samson's hair, that's Samson the Great, the fellow that they mention in the Bible, he got as weak as a baby.

12:38.513 --> 12:39.816
Well, a country's just like that.

12:41.119 --> 12:47.172
Now, if we want to keep our nation strong, we've just got to keep our woods and forests green and growing.

13:01.107 --> 13:03.089
Well, friends, we've run out of time here.

13:03.569 --> 13:05.671
We're going to have to move along down the trail.

13:05.691 --> 13:12.237
We've really enjoyed sitting here under the old pine tree and playing for you, and we hope that you've enjoyed it.

13:12.257 --> 13:14.299
And, friends, don't forget to tune us in.

13:14.319 --> 13:16.681
The announcer will let you know when we'll be on the air again.

13:17.442 --> 13:28.812
And this program comes to you with the best wishes of your State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:29.613 --> 13:30.574
And remember, friends,

13:30.976 --> 13:32.249
Only you can prevent forest fires.

13:32.249 --> 14:07.000
[Music.]
