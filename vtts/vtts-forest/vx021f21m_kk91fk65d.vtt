WEBVTT

00:32.212 --> 00:42.406
Well, howdy, friends.

00:42.426 --> 00:42.987
How y'all?

00:43.247 --> 00:44.108
Yes, here it is.

00:44.188 --> 00:56.064
Once again, time for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knot Heads, brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your state forest service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

00:56.545 --> 01:00.150
Now, we're going to do our best to play a few tunes here that you're going to like.

01:00.170 --> 01:01.071
We hope you like them.

01:01.355 --> 01:02.676
We'll do our best on them.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.278
They're going to be corny, I'll tell you right now.

01:05.619 --> 01:09.162
They are going to be corny, but we'll do our best.

01:09.182 --> 01:11.664
Now, we're sitting right here under the old pine tree.

01:12.084 --> 01:15.507
There's nothing else to do but to do a little picking and the singing.

01:15.527 --> 01:19.751
So I don't know anything else to do here under the old pine tree, sitting on the pine knot, slim.

01:20.672 --> 01:21.933
Kick that pine knot over there, buddy.

01:22.473 --> 01:23.014
Yeah, slim.

01:23.194 --> 01:25.536
That's my right-handed left-handed man, slim.

01:25.556 --> 01:27.878
Hey, you're going to kick the pine knot out of the way, and Robert's coming.

01:27.978 --> 01:29.159
I mean, no, wait, excuse me.

01:29.239 --> 01:30.180
I'll take it all back.

01:30.447 --> 01:39.040
Miss Tyler's little boy, Miss Tyler's little boy Charlie's coming up with his three neck steel giddy playing a little tune called This Is Southland.

02:02.560 --> 02:15.270
We can't get myself.

02:28.987 --> 02:31.971
Well, thank you, Charlie.

02:32.271 --> 02:33.292
Thank you there, my boy.

02:33.352 --> 02:35.195
That's mighty fine carrying on there.

02:35.555 --> 02:39.500
Little tune there called This Is Southland.

02:40.181 --> 02:53.077
Friends, you know, as I told you before, this program is brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your state forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service through the cooperation and the goodwill of the station that you're now listening to.

02:53.097 --> 02:57.462
And now we just want to talk just a little dab, dab and a half, two dabs to you women out there.

02:57.882 --> 02:58.403
You ladies.

02:58.906 --> 03:04.715
I'm telling you, you just don't realize what a hole you got on us men, but you really got a hole.

03:04.755 --> 03:05.496
That's right.

03:06.077 --> 03:07.539
I just don't know what we'd do without them.

03:08.501 --> 03:10.023
Now, I'll tell you the truth.

03:10.083 --> 03:15.712
Now, just laying all jokes aside, no kidding, the ladies usually get their way around.

03:16.554 --> 03:17.796
And they do.

03:17.916 --> 03:19.178
They usually get their way around.

03:19.959 --> 03:22.523
So I just want to appeal to you ladies.

03:22.543 --> 03:25.087
Now, you ladies listen just a little bit here.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.090
I want to talk to you just a minute.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.653
And I'll own up to mine.

03:28.733 --> 03:29.635
I know I'm weak.

03:30.436 --> 03:31.919
And you're strong.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.365
Now there's Mama.

03:34.685 --> 03:38.353
Mama over there, every time I write her, Lord, God bless her.

03:39.014 --> 03:41.940
Every time I write her a letter and say, Mama, I'm coming home.

03:42.376 --> 03:49.985
She bakes me a great big old chocolate cake about three feet deep, I'm telling you, friends, and it'll just melt in your mouth.

03:50.366 --> 03:52.028
Well, she gets me home there.

03:52.048 --> 04:09.649
You know, I get home just to having a big time and everything, and after I get full of cake and coffee and all that, son, I want you to build a shed back on the barn, or I want you to recover the smokehouse or something, and son gets out there with a hammer and nails, and he does it.

04:09.933 --> 04:11.534
Now, that's the way it comes out.

04:11.554 --> 04:13.056
Now, you ladies all know that.

04:13.076 --> 04:15.998
I'm not yawning or nothing like that, but that's right.

04:16.018 --> 04:21.923
Now, I'm appealing to you to help us prevent these forest fires, these wood fires, wild fires.

04:22.283 --> 04:33.113
When the old man gets his two-hole gun and he goes out to hunt, he hunts them ducks, say, two in a bunch or something of that kind, squirrels, possums, anything of that kind.

04:33.313 --> 04:39.038
When he goes to hunt, the last thing you do, you kiss him goodbye and you'll say, honey, be careful.

04:39.058 --> 04:39.518
Why, sure.

04:39.768 --> 04:41.073
Honey, be careful.

04:41.093 --> 04:42.719
That's what my wife tells me.

04:42.739 --> 04:46.512
Why not tell him, honey, be sure and don't set the woods on fire.

04:46.533 --> 04:47.777
Same thing, same thing.

04:48.138 --> 04:49.423
He's liable to get out there.

04:49.724 --> 04:55.312
like a lame fool in a hailstorm and get lost and set the woods on fire and burn yourself up.

04:55.332 --> 04:56.734
But you ladies, you can help.

04:57.014 --> 04:57.575
You know it.

04:57.695 --> 04:59.818
You're standing there laughing at me right now.

05:00.138 --> 05:01.821
Standing there laughing at me, but you can help.

05:02.201 --> 05:03.123
And you know it.

05:03.143 --> 05:04.905
You know you got the ruling hand.

05:04.925 --> 05:10.593
So when that old man goes a squirrel hunting or a possum hunting or something, tell him, honey, be careful with the forest fire.

05:12.155 --> 05:14.298
You're going to sing this next one, ain't you, shorty?

05:14.318 --> 05:15.800
He's going to sing a little diddy call.

05:16.241 --> 05:17.082
That's all.

05:17.939 --> 05:22.907
Some people go to school trying to learn how to teach.

05:22.927 --> 05:27.976
Some people go to school trying to learn how to teach.

05:27.996 --> 05:35.188
But if you can't preach, brother, without going to school, you ain't no preacher.

05:35.208 --> 05:38.473
You're an educated fool, and that's all.

05:38.814 --> 05:40.817
That's all, brother.

05:40.837 --> 05:44.263
Yes, that's all.

05:44.363 --> 05:44.503
Uh-huh.

05:46.863 --> 05:54.136
You better change the way living for the good Lord, see, that's all.

05:54.156 --> 05:55.979
Well, all right, then.

05:57.201 --> 05:58.403
Now, I know a fella.

05:59.265 --> 05:59.565
I know it, too.

05:59.585 --> 06:01.148
He's a mighty fine man.

06:01.168 --> 06:02.310
Yeah, he lives in the third house.

06:02.330 --> 06:05.656
He's trying to save all the money he can.

06:07.078 --> 06:11.065
When that old undertaker lets the man down.

06:11.770 --> 06:16.195
Where's he gonna spend his money under the ground?

06:16.255 --> 06:18.397
And that's all.

06:18.437 --> 06:19.858
That's what I'm talking about.

06:19.878 --> 06:23.021
Yes, that's all.

06:25.744 --> 06:30.349
You better change your way living for the good Lord.

06:30.369 --> 06:32.691
See, that's all.

06:32.771 --> 06:34.653
Well, that's all, brother, that's all.

06:34.673 --> 06:35.594
Come get yourself.

06:36.215 --> 06:38.217
Now, man, come from markets.

06:38.838 --> 06:45.835
So some people say, but in the Holy Bible, it don't tell it that way.

06:45.895 --> 06:50.265
Well, if you believe the monkey tale, and some people do,

06:50.870 --> 06:56.680
Then, brother, I had better be the monkey than you, and that's all.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.763
Well, that's all.

06:59.264 --> 07:04.233
Yes, that's all.

07:04.974 --> 07:14.430
You better change the way living, for the good Lord say that's all.

07:14.410 --> 07:17.394
My little song is finished.

07:18.175 --> 07:20.217
My little song is through.

07:20.237 --> 07:25.224
I didn't necessarily mean to sing this little song to you.

07:25.484 --> 07:38.260
But if you don't like the way my little song goes, it's a mighty good sign I've been a-trumpin' on your toes in that song.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.745
Yes, that song.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.607
I want to tell you about the wood fire, boy.

07:44.482 --> 07:57.235
Well, thank you, Slim, thank you.

07:57.496 --> 07:58.497
That's all.

07:58.517 --> 07:59.458
That's all she wrote.

07:59.478 --> 08:00.319
Come get your saddle.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.723
You ladies out there, I want to talk strictly to you.

08:04.783 --> 08:09.669
Tell the old man to get out, because I just want to talk strictly to you ladies.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.750
Now, you can help.

08:11.551 --> 08:13.813
You can really help 100% with it.

08:14.030 --> 08:17.014
help us with these wood spires and forest fires.

08:17.034 --> 08:19.317
Now you can stay after that old man, the old Nott Head.

08:19.838 --> 08:29.872
You can stay after him to be careful with his smoking and all that sort of stuff, his matches and things when you're out picnicking in the woods, or even just out driving along.

08:29.912 --> 08:34.318
He might light a cigarette and flip the match out the window, you know, and it'll light in the grass.

08:35.019 --> 08:39.565
Certain times of the year to light the grass on the shoulder of the highway and get a fire started.

08:39.663 --> 08:46.411
And first thing you know, it'll burn off acres and acres of land there, timberland, before we can get it stopped.

08:46.431 --> 08:47.972
And you can stop that.

08:47.992 --> 08:49.794
You can help us stop it a whole lot.

08:49.854 --> 08:50.575
You know you can.

08:50.755 --> 08:52.497
Yes, sir, you know you can.

08:52.517 --> 08:53.879
And it's up to you to help us.

08:53.899 --> 08:54.780
We want you to help us.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.942
We're pleading to you to help us.

08:56.962 --> 08:58.164
You stay after the children.

08:58.224 --> 09:01.528
You get after them kids to be mighty careful with matches and fire.

09:01.548 --> 09:04.311
In the first place, they shouldn't be playing with matches and fire.

09:04.331 --> 09:05.712
You know that, too, don't you?

09:05.732 --> 09:06.413
Yeah, you know it.

09:07.186 --> 09:11.671
you can help us a lot here with these forest fires, woods fires.

09:11.691 --> 09:22.543
Ladies, when you go out on a picnic on the fish bank creaking, I mean the creek bank fishing, just appoint yourself fire warden on that little get together.

09:22.563 --> 09:26.708
And see that the fire is well out when you leave and all.

09:26.728 --> 09:32.094
And you know, you can tell Junior to run down that creek and get a bucket of water and pour on the fire, and he'll do it.

09:32.114 --> 09:35.758
When if Daddy tells him, Junior, you go down that creek and get a bucket of water,

09:35.941 --> 09:40.206
Well, Daddy turns around about three times, and Junior forgets it, and that's the end of it, you see?

09:40.586 --> 09:41.467
But not you ladies.

09:41.727 --> 09:46.052
No, sir, when you start out to do something, you get it done.

09:46.072 --> 09:51.437
I'm not trying to put a feather in your hat, no, but that's just plain fact, just like the nose on your face.

09:51.457 --> 09:55.642
And you all know it, all of you out there listening, you know that I'm telling you the truth.

09:56.603 --> 10:01.468
Now, there's a lot of you ladies out there that belong to clubs and organizations.

10:01.488 --> 10:03.190
You're doing a wonderful job.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.172
You're really doing a wonderful job.

10:05.388 --> 10:07.350
And we're really proud of you.

10:07.370 --> 10:09.472
But all we need is just more of it.

10:09.593 --> 10:10.534
That's what we need.

10:10.614 --> 10:11.154
More of it.

10:11.174 --> 10:12.496
We've got to have more of it.

10:12.936 --> 10:14.798
And you can do your part.

10:14.818 --> 10:17.801
You might think, well, me by myself, I can't do nothing.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.723
No, maybe you can't.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.747
But your little two bits worth will go a long ways, ladies.

10:22.927 --> 10:23.888
It'll go a long way.

10:24.348 --> 10:25.530
And you just think that over.

10:26.030 --> 10:28.012
Now we're going to do another tune here.

10:28.032 --> 10:28.573
Let's see.

10:28.593 --> 10:29.774
I believe the trio.

10:29.955 --> 10:30.395
Robert?

10:30.415 --> 10:30.775
Robert?

10:30.956 --> 10:32.037
Robert's going to sing.

10:32.397 --> 10:33.799
All you girls, gather around.

10:34.139 --> 10:35.040
Girls, gather around.

10:35.240 --> 10:39.030
Yep, here's the old maid's heartthrob to do the next tune.

10:39.070 --> 10:49.958
He's going to sing, Robert the Boy with the Fiddle, doing a tune called Hopeless Love.

10:53.887 --> 11:20.029
A hopeless love now burns within me You sure have told me from the start A love I thought would bring no sorrow But now it's locked away deep in my heart Memories always stay to haunt me

11:20.009 --> 11:39.517
Dreams that make my night so long Hopeless days of want and worry Hopeless love that was all wrong Hey, all right, Mr. Tyler.

11:39.537 --> 11:39.677
My, my.

11:39.697 --> 11:40.178
Look here.

11:40.198 --> 11:40.819
Look here.

11:58.096 --> 12:19.542
Well, thank you, Robert.

12:19.582 --> 12:20.383
Thank you there, son.

12:20.403 --> 12:21.624
That's mighty well done.

12:21.644 --> 12:22.646
Mighty well done.

12:22.686 --> 12:24.848
Hope you ladies out there enjoyed that especially.

12:24.868 --> 12:28.052
I guarantee you we're talking strictly to the ladies today.

12:28.505 --> 12:30.827
After all, they're the backbone of the nation.

12:30.847 --> 12:37.533
They can help us 100% with these forest fires, woods fires, wildfires, the old lady, the kids, and everybody concerned.

12:38.354 --> 12:41.537
Ladies, here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you.

12:42.198 --> 12:42.798
Please listen.

12:43.839 --> 12:54.089
If the ladies, bless them, got behind forest fire prevention throughout the land, we'd cut down the careless fires to beat the band.

12:55.590 --> 12:55.650
Go!

12:55.670 --> 12:57.432
Down the hill!

13:04.533 --> 13:06.035
Friends, we've run out of time here.

13:06.055 --> 13:06.976
We're going to have to go.

13:07.897 --> 13:21.153
We would like to remind you, though, that this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your state forest service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:21.473 --> 13:22.294
Tune us in again.

13:22.314 --> 13:27.420
The announcer will let you know the exact date, and we'd like to have you listen right as a card.

13:28.181 --> 13:32.987
Remember, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:35.600 --> 13:43.996
Well, all right, Hill.

13:44.016 --> 13:47.202
Well, go down.

13:47.222 --> 13:52.292
Well, Mr. Tyler, sorry, Tyler.
