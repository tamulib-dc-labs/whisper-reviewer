00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
[Silence.]

00:11.000 --> 00:19.000
[Music.]

00:11.438 --> 00:23.053
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:23.433 --> 00:25.096
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:25.136 --> 00:26.818
That was how he got his name.

00:27.399 --> 00:28.180
Hi there, friends.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.202
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:30.883 --> 00:32.545
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:33.226 --> 00:38.353
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:38.373 --> 00:40.095
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:41.054 --> 00:45.039
That's because we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:45.059 --> 00:49.605
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:50.567 --> 00:56.495
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the sons of the pioneers.

00:57.916 --> 00:59.839
Hey, you fellas, what's going on over there?

01:00.545 --> 01:05.577
Well, Billy, it's a swell day for a picnic out here, so we've brought along food and all the fixin'.

01:05.658 --> 01:12.574
Hot dogs, hamburgers, buns for toastin', pickles, tater salad, pie, tea for Suge Fisher, our bass player, and coffee for the rest of us.

01:13.296 --> 01:17.727
All we need now, fellas, is a good cookin' fire, so how about throwin' another log on?

01:25.520 --> 01:52.337
Throw another log on the fire. Keep my golden memories aglow. I don't see the face of my loved one When the logs are burning low.

01:54.376 --> 02:24.383
Throw another log on the fire. Bring back all the sweetest days I've known. When our hearts were young in the springtime And her love was mine alone. Now there's nothing left

02:24.768 --> 02:52.412
But the embers. Springtime seems so long ago. Throw another log on the fire. Keep my golden memories aglow. Now there's nothing left

02:53.000 --> 02:55.684
But the embers.

02:56.885 --> 03:02.613
Springtime seems so long ago.

03:03.815 --> 03:09.182
Throw another log on

03:09.203 --> 03:13.168
Keep my golden memories aglow.

03:23.408 --> 03:30.298
I'm sure that every one of you at one time or another has enjoyed a campfire out in the woods or in a forest.

03:31.480 --> 03:42.856
That is, of course, after the excitement of getting the fire started is over and the breeze has shifted in the right direction so the smoke doesn't get in your eyes and your hot dogs and hamburgers haven't fallen into the fire.

03:43.998 --> 03:48.825
Seriously, though, doesn't food taste wonderful when you cook it over an outdoor fire?

03:49.970 --> 03:58.608
Of course, it takes a little experience to build a campfire right, just as it takes experience to do a good cooking job outdoors.

03:58.628 --> 04:04.300
Now, the real experts along this line are the men who live in the woods most of the time, the lumberjacks.

04:05.917 --> 04:10.082
Come all you sons of freedom that run the Saginaw stream.

04:10.502 --> 04:14.407
Come all you roving lumberjacks and listen to my theme.

04:14.828 --> 04:19.032
We'll cross the Tittabawassee where the mighty waters flow.

04:19.052 --> 04:23.097
We'll range the wild woods over and once more a-lumbering go.

04:23.117 --> 04:24.899
And once more a-lumbering go.

04:24.919 --> 04:27.022
Once more a-lumbering go.

04:27.362 --> 04:32.228
We'll range the wild woods over and once more a-lumbering go.

04:32.579 --> 04:40.552
With our axes on our shoulder, we'll make the woods resound, and many a tall and stately tree will tumble to the ground.

04:40.933 --> 04:53.153
With our axes on our shoulder, to our boot tops deep in snow, we'll range the wild woods over, and once more a-lumbering go, and once more a-lumbering go, and once more a-lumbering go.

04:53.234 --> 04:57.141
We'll range the wild woods over and once more a-lumbering go.

04:58.483 --> 05:02.871
You may talk about your farms, your houses and fine ways.

05:02.891 --> 05:07.559
And pity us poor shanty boys while dashing in our sleighs.

05:08.180 --> 05:11.927
Around the good campfire at night we'll sing while wild winds blow.

05:12.127 --> 05:15.934
And we'll range the wild woods over and once more a-lumbering go.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.178
And once more a-lumbering go.

05:18.158 --> 05:25.851
Once more a-lumbering go, and we'll range the wild woods over, and once more a-lumbering go.

05:27.494 --> 05:31.881
What a colorful bunch the early day lumberjacks were.

05:31.901 --> 05:39.434
But just like the lumberjacks of today, they were mighty careful with their campfire, with any fire in the forest.

05:39.454 --> 05:40.977
They have to be.

05:40.997 --> 05:42.900
Their very livelihood depends on it.

05:44.045 --> 05:48.730
You can always tell a good woodsman by the way he builds and handles his campfire.

05:49.831 --> 05:53.314
He always keeps his fires small, especially for cooking.

05:54.115 --> 05:56.978
He never goes off and leaves it unattended.

05:56.998 --> 05:59.580
He puts it out, dead out, when he's through with it.

06:00.882 --> 06:05.626
All of us would do well to follow the example of the professional woodsman.

06:05.646 --> 06:09.250
If we do, the woods and forest will always be a happy place.

06:10.451 --> 06:12.533
And I think the Sons of the Pioneers agree with me.

06:14.251 --> 06:20.177
Now, prairie folks assure you there ain't nothing that'll cure you any quicker than the medicine they fix up for themselves.

06:20.197 --> 06:26.524
With their sulfur and molasses, pepper tea and mustard plasters and their camper bags and flannel rags that line the bunkhouse shelf.

06:26.544 --> 06:31.169
But here's one remedy that they use that never fails to chase the blues.

06:32.010 --> 06:40.039
Just try it for yourself and see the world get brighter.

06:40.593 --> 06:46.083
When you get weary of trouble and care, here's what a cowhand would say,

06:46.804 --> 06:52.314
Cast your eye on the sun, the sky. Yippee-ay your troubles away.

06:53.115 --> 06:56.201
When you cut loose, watch your troubles famoose.

06:56.221 --> 06:58.705
Skies will be cloudy or gray.

06:59.427 --> 07:05.217
No reason why you should worry or cry. Yippee-ay your troubles away.

07:05.703 --> 07:08.428
Scatter your woes with the sunrise.

07:09.010 --> 07:11.174
Everything's rosy and swell.

07:12.076 --> 07:14.601
Just sing a note through that lump in your throat.

07:14.861 --> 07:18.028
Greet the dawn with a cowboy yell.

07:18.509 --> 07:21.214
Here's what to do when you're lonely and blue.

07:21.565 --> 07:30.851
Make it a wonderful day. Cast your eye on the sun and the sky. Yippee-ay your troubles away. 

07:30.851 --> 07:43.000
[Music.]

07:43.000 --> 07:50.371
Scatter your bows with the sunrise Everything's rosy and swell

07:50.371 --> 08:20.243
Just sing a note through that lump in your throat Read the dawn with a cowboy yell. Here's what you do when you're lonely and blue. Make it a wonderful day. Cast your eye on the sun and the sky. 
Yippee-ay your troubles away. Yippee-ay your troubles away. You know, it's usually when we're having a good time that we're apt to get a little careless

08:21.775 --> 08:24.800
Take the case of that party of fishermen in California a while back.

08:25.541 --> 08:27.904
They had a wonderful weekend camping and fishing.

08:28.966 --> 08:32.130
On their way home, they stopped in a little town to pick up some tobacco.

08:33.392 --> 08:36.197
In the store window, there was a picture of Smokey Bear.

08:37.378 --> 08:43.207
One of the fellas turned to the other and said, Say, are you sure we put out our campfire?

08:43.227 --> 08:45.490
They all looked at one another and weren't quite sure.

08:46.732 --> 08:50.618
So those good people headed some 20 miles back to their camping spots.

08:51.357 --> 08:58.648
Sure enough, in spite of the coffee grounds and dishwater that they'd dumped on the fire before they left, some hot coals were still burning.

08:59.389 --> 09:04.136
And at one corner, the fire was beginning to break away in the pine needles.

09:04.156 --> 09:06.980
Well, sir, this time they put their fire out right.

09:08.562 --> 09:10.845
I think those fishermen were pretty lucky, don't you?

09:12.307 --> 09:15.252
Some people don't get a second chance.

09:15.272 --> 09:18.276
That's why everybody should do the job right the first time.

09:19.808 --> 09:22.195
Well, would you look who's coming up the trail now?

09:22.215 --> 09:26.126
Big as life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all talked out in dungarees.

09:26.848 --> 09:29.194
It's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

09:29.866 --> 09:31.608
Hello there, friends.

09:31.969 --> 09:37.375
I just passed a fellow on the trail who sure knows his beans about campfires.

09:37.395 --> 09:44.864
He built his fire in a spot that he had cleared down to dirt about six feet across, and he was putting it out when I saw him.

09:45.145 --> 09:53.275
He was soaking the little fire with water, all the time stirring the coals and turning the embers over and over to soak them on all sides.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.958
He even watered the earth around the fire.

09:56.258 --> 09:59.462
He wasn't taking any chances on his fire getting away.

09:59.943 --> 10:00.623
No, sir.

10:01.324 --> 10:03.747
Well, I'll be seeing you.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.349
And there he goes down the trail.

10:06.110 --> 10:07.231
Thank you, Smokey.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.694
Campfires.

10:10.515 --> 10:14.540
They can be a great help and a lot of fun, all right.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.985
But we've just got to be careful with them.

10:18.005 --> 10:22.350
And you know, it's a funny thing about campfires, the way they affect people.

10:23.512 --> 10:25.794
Lloyd Pearman has some thoughts on this, too.

10:25.815 --> 10:34.204
There's something about a campfire burning low in the dark of night that makes you feel, well, kind of good and easy and warm inside.

10:34.244 --> 10:41.211
I've seen men that you could hardly get along with in daylight go sort of mellow sitting around a campfire.

10:41.231 --> 10:48.719
Makes you think back on the day that's just passed, and it's the good things that happened that come to your mind mostly.

10:48.739 --> 10:51.983
Makes you want to sing just the way you feel.

10:57.059 --> 11:22.628
When shadows creep where weary birds are nesting, and twilight bids the sleepy rose good night, when drowsy breezes speak to you of resting, do they whisper that

11:23.300 --> 11:48.362
The world's all right? When you come to the end of the day, And the night calls your worries away,

11:52.527 --> 12:20.863
do you ever watch the setting sun and dream of things that you might have done? Do you turn from your work with a smile? Do you feel that its all worthwhile

12:27.205 --> 12:55.103
As you dream the twilight hours away When you come to the end of the day?

12:58.458 --> 13:07.467
You know, friends, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:08.428 --> 13:19.799
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:19.819 --> 13:25.545
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:26.133 --> 13:35.344
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:35.364 --> 13:39.149
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

13:39.490 --> 13:43.695
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

13:44.256 --> 13:48.681
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.907
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

13:53.047 --> 13:57.513
Each can find the fire before it starts to flame.

13:57.893 --> 14:02.219
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:02.219 --> 14:21.334
[Music.]

14:21.334 --> 15:21.000
[Silence.]
