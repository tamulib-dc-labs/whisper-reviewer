00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
[Silence.]

00:17.000 --> 00:30.592
[Music.]

00:30.592 --> 00:43.227
The Texas Forest Service of A&M College presents The Three Trees, a dramatization of an incident which happened, so the legend goes, at Galveston Island in the year 1821.

00:43.328 --> 00:54.321
There, at the town known as Campeche, was the stronghold of that fearless rover of the seas, the buccaneer Jean Lafitte.

01:00.595 --> 01:10.754
Here, where the Isle of Galvez shines, a silver line between the Azure Gulf and Emerald Bay, here for a moment shows the pageant of a mimicked court.

01:11.495 --> 01:16.444
Here gleam the light of Orient jewels and the sheen of Orient fabric.

01:16.897 --> 01:24.634
Hear the strange perfumes of fallen spices linger on the air, and red gold sparkles booty from the sea.

01:25.456 --> 01:32.712
And from his tower, Lafitte, the debonair, laughs and flings his blood-red standard out.

01:39.695 --> 01:41.962
Welcome, Lieutenant Carnet.

01:41.982 --> 01:44.671
Welcome to Campeche and to Maison Rouge.

01:44.751 --> 01:45.494
Thank you, Lafitte.

01:46.056 --> 01:47.440
An interesting place you have here.

01:47.902 --> 01:53.299
A comfortable retreat for myself and my men when we come back from a sea voyage.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.449
Fetch the lieutenant a chair.

01:55.909 --> 01:58.411
This is my first opportunity to see this part of the coast.

01:59.132 --> 02:01.154
I must say I enjoy the experience.

02:01.174 --> 02:03.096
We have a pretty island here.

02:03.116 --> 02:07.060
Not perhaps the cosmopolitan, nor cultured life of New Orleans.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.104
But we are moonlit nights, and a fresh breeze to satisfy a sailor's heart.

02:12.685 --> 02:15.047
Won't you try some of our fresh fruit?

02:15.067 --> 02:17.169
I'll have a man bring in a basket.

02:17.189 --> 02:20.893
Francois, fetch in a basket of fruit for this officer.

02:21.233 --> 02:23.235
Please, mon capitaine.

02:23.215 --> 02:27.362
And how does the United States of America find itself these days?

02:27.382 --> 02:32.532
It'll find itself, I believe, in better position when I've accomplished my present mission.

02:32.552 --> 02:35.557
But it's not necessary to rush immediately into the purpose of my visit.

02:36.078 --> 02:37.100
Come, come, man.

02:37.300 --> 02:44.633
Since when as an officer in the United States Navy had to fear the proprieties, state what is in your mind.

02:44.663 --> 02:49.716
I'm commissioned by my government to request that you leave this island, taking your men and ships.

02:50.017 --> 02:51.180
Sacre bleu.

02:51.561 --> 02:52.062
But why?

02:52.544 --> 02:55.752
Am I not on present good terms with your government?

02:55.812 --> 03:01.407
It's unfortunate that as long as you remain here, your men become involved in piracy against our ships.

03:01.387 --> 03:07.137
You refer, I suppose, to Brown when he stripped the American vessel near the Sabee River.

03:07.157 --> 03:11.064
You know I am sure that he has operated against my order.

03:11.084 --> 03:13.448
I had him hanged before the American schooner.

03:13.729 --> 03:17.335
Police arrived here to investigate the matter.

03:17.355 --> 03:20.701
President Madison was convinced I had no fault.

03:20.761 --> 03:24.508
Another of your cruisers has scuttled an American vessel in Matagorda Bay.

03:24.488 --> 03:36.158
Even though these offenses against American ships are committed contrary to your orders, it's, well, it's the opinion of the American government that there'll be less danger of losing American ships if you move farther from our shores.

03:36.178 --> 03:36.979
C'est possible.

03:37.459 --> 03:38.480
Perhaps you are right.

03:38.981 --> 03:42.584
But it will be with great sadness that I leave Campeche.

03:43.084 --> 03:45.587
I will not be taking my Catherine with me.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.689
Ah, here is Antoine with the fruit.

03:48.709 --> 03:50.031
Dans les tables, Antoine.

03:50.411 --> 03:51.092
Et merci.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.854
Ã€ votre service, mon capitaine.

03:54.070 --> 03:56.693
Will you try this melon, Lieutenant Carney?

03:57.134 --> 04:01.159
It is of the finest grown, and perhaps a glass of bouvrier?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.181
Thank you.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.522
I shall appreciate refreshments.

04:03.562 --> 04:05.645
It was stout word getting over the bar.

04:06.226 --> 04:08.649
I shall have entertainment for you soon.

04:08.669 --> 04:10.832
I will arrange singing and music.

04:10.852 --> 04:18.963
We have an unsavory rascal who knows little of Haydn or Mozart, but plays an amusing gipsy dance on his violin.

04:19.023 --> 04:20.685
I'm sure it'll be most pleasant.

04:20.665 --> 04:24.371
But now, Lieutenant Carney, to get back for a moment to business.

04:25.032 --> 04:30.782
I suppose there is little hope of the American government changing its official mind about me.

04:30.802 --> 04:32.445
Very little, I fear.

04:32.465 --> 04:37.594
We've not forgotten the service you did in coming to the aid of General Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans.

04:37.962 --> 04:39.605
But we must protect ourselves.

04:39.965 --> 04:41.287
That was only spot.

04:41.487 --> 04:43.871
The British hadn't learnt of Indian fighting.

04:44.392 --> 04:52.585
I'll never forget the scene when they marched in even road in their red-white monkey suits towards us behind our bales of cotton.

04:53.066 --> 04:56.291
They had few targets for their musket balls that day.

04:56.411 --> 04:58.895
Without you, General Jackson would have been lost.

04:58.915 --> 05:01.759
And now you ask me to leave Campeche?

05:02.144 --> 05:03.508
When must I sail?

05:03.528 --> 05:05.453
At the earliest possible time.

05:05.473 --> 05:08.642
I shall require about two months to arrange my affair.

05:08.863 --> 05:12.433
Well, it will, of course, be necessary for me to return here to witness your departure.

05:12.453 --> 05:17.166
I must be able to assure the American government that you have actually sailed.

05:17.146 --> 05:23.218
And if I don't, you will probably bring the full force of your Navy ships down here to drive me out.

05:23.238 --> 05:24.821
Well, it is agreed.

05:24.841 --> 05:28.147
And now permit me to present something more pleasant than business.

05:28.729 --> 05:32.556
If you will step outside, we will have the entertainment begin.

05:43.049 --> 05:45.673
Lieutenant Fanny, I am nearly ready.

05:46.194 --> 05:50.581
I will instruct my men to burn the settlement, and we will sail with the tide.

05:50.701 --> 05:53.525
I'm sorry to see this little village go up in smoke, Lafitte.

05:54.026 --> 05:56.590
With it goes my career, I am afraid.

05:56.610 --> 06:01.238
I feel that never again will life hold for me what it has in the past.

06:01.258 --> 06:04.703
First I leave Barataria, now Campeche.

06:04.683 --> 06:07.246
Who knows where fate shall lead me?

06:07.266 --> 06:09.730
I wish you'd settle down to acquire a life, Lafitte.

06:10.230 --> 06:13.915
Surely you can carve a career in some more respectable pursuit?

06:13.935 --> 06:15.878
The sea has been my life.

06:15.898 --> 06:16.979
But enough of that.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.524
If you will pardon me, I will address the men.

06:21.846 --> 06:23.027
Attention, mes amis.

06:23.588 --> 06:29.796
As you know, we have been commanded by the government of the United States of America to abandon this coast.

06:30.277 --> 06:32.580
The time has come when we must separate.

06:33.016 --> 06:36.399
I have already distributed your fair share of our wealth.

06:36.840 --> 06:44.887
To those of you who have already spent, lost or wasted your money, I will give an amount which will take you back to New Orleans.

06:47.790 --> 06:54.617
To further ensure the American government that we are finally abandoning Campeche, we will burn the town.

06:54.637 --> 06:57.319
Every building is to be destroyed before we leave.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.222
The wards of the harbour must also go.

07:00.202 --> 07:06.931
I myself will then sail in my brig the Pride with Black and Bill Cochrane following me in command.

07:07.631 --> 07:12.217
Black will name those of you we desire to sail with us in the Pride.

07:12.237 --> 07:18.746
If those men do not desire to throw in their lot with me, I shall accept volunteers.

07:18.766 --> 07:20.328
I'll sail with you, Lafitte.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.210
Put down John Watkins' name.

07:22.190 --> 07:25.354
It appears that some of you still hold faith to me.

07:25.734 --> 07:27.797
Now, men, set fire to the town.

07:27.937 --> 07:29.559
La Maison Rouge, I see?

07:29.920 --> 07:37.970
Yes, my Red Manchant, too.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.354
And so, Lieutenant Carney, ends completion.

07:41.374 --> 07:44.137
I wish you fair weather, Lafitte, and a good sailing breeze.

07:45.959 --> 07:48.062
The End

07:55.332 --> 07:58.738
Look, Robert, Lafitte is mounting to the quarter-deck.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.703
I wonder what our destination will be, Seurat.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.847
Perhaps he'll tell us now.

08:03.867 --> 08:04.949
We've been at sea a day.

08:05.009 --> 08:06.131
It's time we knew more.

08:09.437 --> 08:12.042
Men, I want to tell you my plan.

08:12.545 --> 08:15.432
We have shipped together again, for better or worse.

08:16.053 --> 08:19.802
All of you aboard the Pride because you prepare to sail again with me.

08:20.323 --> 08:27.600
It is my plan to sail toward Yucatan, and it is my hope that we soon capture a Spanish merchantman.

08:30.027 --> 08:35.357
Fewer Spanish ships sail in these waters than we started relieving them of their cargoes.

08:35.377 --> 08:40.065
But if we go on south, there are sure to be some pretty targets for our guns.

08:40.727 --> 08:44.794
Any prizes we take will be distributed, as we have always done.

08:45.355 --> 08:49.082
Most of you still have a fair amount of doublons from other raids.

08:49.568 --> 08:53.254
Ship's rules will be obeyed now as in the past.

08:53.274 --> 08:55.817
I will deal with any cases of disobedience.

08:56.438 --> 09:06.173
And to those of you who might entertain thoughts of mutiny to steal my gold, I might tell you that I have brought very little wealth with me.

09:06.193 --> 09:08.477
My respects, Captain Lafitte.

09:08.497 --> 09:10.460
And where is your great treasure?

09:10.960 --> 09:12.503
My greatest treasure?

09:13.384 --> 09:18.732
My greatest treasure is buried at the foot of the three trees.

09:29.225 --> 09:31.649
Robert, did you hear what Lafitte said?

09:31.849 --> 09:33.131
About the treasure, Seurat?

09:33.151 --> 09:33.471
Yes.

09:33.932 --> 09:35.154
It must be great wealth.

09:35.895 --> 09:39.240
Lafitte has never wasted all the golds and jewels from his share.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.543
I wish I had the treasure of which he speaks.

09:42.264 --> 09:43.846
Search for it, Robert.

09:43.866 --> 09:47.552
It would be necessary to jump ship at the next port and return to Campeche.

09:47.892 --> 09:48.673
Why not?

09:48.693 --> 09:49.835
But if we're discovered.

09:49.915 --> 09:52.098
Who is there to discover us?

09:52.118 --> 09:57.426
Lafitte has given orders that every man must forever leave Campeche.

09:57.446 --> 09:58.928
As soon as we have found it,

09:59.228 --> 10:02.432
can go on to New Orleans, then east.

10:02.452 --> 10:04.895
Lafitte will never know until we are far away.

10:05.716 --> 10:07.918
Too far for him to ever find us again.

10:08.018 --> 10:09.080
How can we leave the ship?

10:09.700 --> 10:13.885
There is a possibility that we will find a Spanish ship soon near Yucatan.

10:14.746 --> 10:19.572
Once we have captured her, Lafitte will want to put into port to dispose of some of the booty.

10:20.473 --> 10:25.459
We can watch our chance until another ship is ready to sail for New Orleans, some nearby port.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.763
Then we can desert ship and sign on to the other ship.

10:29.418 --> 10:32.568
Once in New Orleans, we can go overland to Campeche.

10:32.708 --> 10:40.693
I'm with you, Sir Ron, on my oath.

10:45.635 --> 10:47.357
We're nearly at the Three Trees, Saron.

10:47.678 --> 10:52.044
Well, this is an easier way to get gold than by taking it from a Spaniard.

10:52.064 --> 10:56.229
I wonder what Lafitte will say when he finds we've been to the Three Trees before him.

10:56.249 --> 10:58.032
Hey, little Lord, what can he say?

10:58.352 --> 11:01.036
It may be ten years before he returns to this spot.

11:01.136 --> 11:03.339
These cursed shovels are heavy.

11:03.359 --> 11:05.341
I'll rest a moment before I go on.

11:05.361 --> 11:07.384
I can hardly wait to see the treasure.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.488
I'll go along to discover the spot.

11:10.508 --> 11:12.431
Come along as soon as you catch your breath.

11:12.611 --> 11:13.212
May we...

11:17.613 --> 11:18.755
Rich, rich.

11:19.436 --> 11:22.240
No more days on the ocean sea for me.

11:22.260 --> 11:25.645
No more cutlasses and gunfire from the Spanish ships.

11:25.665 --> 11:27.928
No more working in the rigging and nasty weather.

11:28.789 --> 11:32.154
I think I shall settle in New Orleans.

11:32.174 --> 11:36.120
A fine cloak and hat and a ruby ring on my finger.

11:36.841 --> 11:39.525
I shall call myself a gentleman.

11:39.545 --> 11:43.671
Ladies shall smile at me on the streets and... Robert, come here.

11:44.112 --> 11:44.953
Coming, Seurat.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.301
Here I am, Saron.

11:47.321 --> 11:48.462
What is it?

11:48.482 --> 11:50.764
Look what is under the three threes.

11:51.405 --> 11:53.206
A white cross.

11:53.226 --> 11:55.028
Yes, a white cross.

11:55.829 --> 11:58.832
And see what the letters say.

11:58.852 --> 12:02.335
Here lies buried Catherine.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.037
Born 1799.

12:04.137 --> 12:08.361
Departed this life 1820.

12:08.561 --> 12:14.046
The greatest treasure of Jean Lafitte.

12:26.733 --> 12:32.479
And so ends the legend of Jean Lafitte and the Three Trees.

12:33.601 --> 12:37.926
Lafitte sailed to the south, and little is known of him from that time on.

12:38.646 --> 12:44.813
Lafitte's ship, the Pride, was a 14-gun brig built of stout wooden planks and timbers.

12:45.394 --> 12:52.622
In those days, wood was used in nearly every part of a ship, the hull, masts, yards, booms,

12:53.024 --> 12:56.850
Bowlsprit, decking, cabins, chairs, tables, and bunks.

12:57.591 --> 13:02.018
Today, wood remains an important material in shipping.

13:02.639 --> 13:07.968
Texas shipyards use huge quantities of lumber in the building of steel ships.

13:07.988 --> 13:14.819
More than 300,000 feet of lumber go into the ways for the building of just one cargo ship of the Liberty class.

13:14.839 --> 13:17.243
And many small boats are built largely of wood.

13:17.712 --> 13:28.686
The shipbuilding industry rapidly expanded during the war in the Texas cities of Orange, Seabrook, Rockport, Port Arthur, Corpus Christi, Brownsville, Beaumont, Houston, and Galveston.

13:28.706 --> 13:36.376
Millions of board feet of Texas timber are used in piling for harbors, in construction of wharves, shipping offices, and warehouses.

13:36.857 --> 13:39.640
Texas now has 14 deepwater ports.

13:40.081 --> 13:45.508
Galveston, Houston, Texas City, Beaumont, Port Arthur, Orange, Port Natchez, Sabine Pass,

13:45.488 --> 13:50.356
Corpus Christi, Freeport, Aransas Pass, Ingleside, Brownsville, and Port Isabel.

13:50.937 --> 13:59.371
Six of them are situated 15 to 55 miles inland on deep water channels that cut through the easily excavated earth of the coastal plain.

14:00.052 --> 14:04.600
Together they constitute one of the greatest shipping communities on any coastline in the world.

14:05.041 --> 14:08.005
Communities whose homes are built largely of wood.

14:08.707 --> 14:11.952
Texas manufactured products are shipped all over the world.

14:12.320 --> 14:17.188
Wooden containers made from Texas timber are needed for shipping these products.

14:17.669 --> 14:26.745
Boxes, baskets, barrels, kegs, crates, cardboard boxes, and paper cartons are all made in Texas to safely carry Texas products overseas.

14:27.406 --> 14:33.957
And hundreds of thousands of tons of wood and pulp and paper products are shipped from these same ports.

14:40.366 --> 14:49.918
A constant supply of timber can build a greater Texas.

14:49.938 --> 14:55.205
