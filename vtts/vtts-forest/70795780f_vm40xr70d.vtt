WEBVTT

00:31.418 --> 00:35.884
Well, howdy friends, how are y'all?

00:36.224 --> 00:40.430
Yeah, here it is once again, time for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knot Heads.

00:41.431 --> 00:47.299
We're sitting here under the old pine tree just mowsing, sitting around, you know, nothing to do.

00:47.319 --> 00:53.848
We've been out cruising around over the woods and all wound up back here and we got the fiddle tars and the pick fiddles and

00:54.183 --> 00:57.488
things here with us, and we're going to play a few tunes for you.

00:57.948 --> 00:59.591
Right here under the old pine tree.

01:00.072 --> 01:03.016
I know you can hear the breeze blowing through the pine tree.

01:03.036 --> 01:04.618
The wind is really fine.

01:04.638 --> 01:05.660
It tastes good.

01:05.700 --> 01:06.761
I wish you was here with us.

01:07.102 --> 01:08.924
Here's the first tune, featured Robert.

01:09.525 --> 01:12.850
Robert with his fiddle, his strata potato, Beaumont rag.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.307
Hey, Slim, look out here.

01:47.328 --> 01:48.039
Let's go, boy.

01:48.202 --> 01:48.405
Oh, man.

02:25.223 --> 02:28.489
Well, thank you, Robert, thank you.

02:28.870 --> 02:31.715
I'm telling you, that Robert is really getting on the ball.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.258
That boy's really fine.

02:33.679 --> 02:35.722
He's getting better every minute.

02:36.003 --> 02:43.997
You know, friends, north, south, east, and west, friends, they sure getting tree planting wise.

02:44.138 --> 02:47.063
I'm telling you, they really getting tree planting wise.

02:48.140 --> 02:49.862
That's pretty wonderful, too.

02:49.882 --> 02:50.784
That's pretty nice.

02:51.144 --> 03:04.463
Considering how we need the growback forest to replace all those trees that's plumbed, gone, and cut down, you know, and all where they got the deal about they cut down the old pine tree and hauled it away to the mill.

03:04.483 --> 03:05.745
Well, it's cut down and gone.

03:06.065 --> 03:09.670
But there's a lot of people planting that old pine tree back.

03:09.690 --> 03:16.139
You know, friends, I know a young married couple here a few years ago, just a few years back.

03:16.159 --> 03:18.062
Now, they got married, and...

03:18.498 --> 03:22.024
They really had big ideas, as every married couple's got.

03:22.044 --> 03:24.447
You know, when they first get married, they really got big ideas.

03:25.108 --> 03:29.235
Well, they lived there for a while, you know.

03:29.275 --> 03:34.623
And first thing you know, they had something running around the house besides the picket fence.

03:34.643 --> 03:35.885
Well, they had little Junior.

03:35.945 --> 03:38.429
Little Junior, he was running around the house there.

03:38.690 --> 03:41.113
Well, of course, they was really proud of Junior.

03:41.454 --> 03:44.238
And, of course, they wanted Junior to have the best.

03:44.318 --> 03:45.400
The best wasn't good enough.

03:45.886 --> 03:49.634
Well, there were poor people, just like myself, and all those country people.

03:49.654 --> 04:03.203
They didn't have a lot, and they wanted Junior to have a good education and everything, so they was just figuring how in the world, what we're going to do and how we're going to do when Junior gets old enough to go to college.

04:03.908 --> 04:09.914
They finally fell on the idea of planting pine trees.

04:09.934 --> 04:13.357
They lived there, you know, where pine trees grew good.

04:13.417 --> 04:17.841
There was a good soil and everything for pine timber, but it just didn't happen to be any.

04:17.861 --> 04:20.643
It had been cut off years before their time.

04:20.663 --> 04:28.471
So they fell on the idea of growing a pine forest, you know, and so they planted about 40 acres there.

04:28.491 --> 04:29.912
Yeah, they got them.

04:29.972 --> 04:33.375
They consulted their state forest and nursery, you know, and

04:33.710 --> 04:57.118
planted there about 40 acres and boy it grew off there and it was really looking nice just coming right along with that little junior and they figured that'd be the thing to do that grow up this forest there along with junior and by the time junior got ready to go to college the timber would be ready to cut and they'd cut the timber and that'd be the answer to their problem is to send a junior to

04:57.470 --> 04:59.952
School, don't you see, out to college and everything.

04:59.992 --> 05:05.837
That would really be just the same thing as having money in the bank or paid up policy or something.

05:05.857 --> 05:07.999
So they had everything.

05:08.019 --> 05:10.381
They just had the situation well in hand.

05:10.602 --> 05:15.306
You know, before I get into this story, Clem, I think you ought to sing a song.

05:15.486 --> 05:19.830
I'm still going to continue this story about this young married couple because I know this thing to happen.

05:20.150 --> 05:22.232
Oh, the three of you, this is awful, friends.

05:22.252 --> 05:23.473
Three of them are going to sing it once.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.755
Here it is, Faded Love.

05:35.489 --> 05:58.982
I look at the letters that you wrote to me

05:59.603 --> 06:21.004
that i am thinking of as i read the lines that me were so sweet i remember our faded love i miss you darling more

06:22.503 --> 06:46.317
every day as heaven would miss the stars above with every heartbeat i still think of you and remember i faded love

07:10.951 --> 07:22.926
I think of the past and of the pleasures we've had as I watch the mating of the dove.

07:22.946 --> 07:23.306
I hear you now.

07:24.648 --> 07:31.236
It was in the springtime when we said goodbye.

07:31.797 --> 07:36.503
I remember I faded love.

07:38.474 --> 07:50.809
I miss you, darling, more and more every day as heaven would miss the stars above.

07:52.171 --> 08:07.890
With every heartbeat I still think of you and remember our faded love and remember our

08:10.807 --> 08:18.196
Sweet tune there called Fated Love, and Slim and Robert and Charlie doing the vocal on it.

08:18.236 --> 08:19.298
Hope you enjoyed it a whole lot.

08:19.538 --> 08:21.921
You know, I just been thinking.

08:21.941 --> 08:26.287
I backed off over in the corner, and all this time while the boy was singing, I was thinking.

08:26.307 --> 08:26.927
I'm trying to think.

08:27.408 --> 08:29.070
I'm surprised I didn't get hurt.

08:29.090 --> 08:32.895
But I wanted to finish this story about this young married couple.

08:32.975 --> 08:36.079
This young couple had planted these pine trees.

08:36.119 --> 08:36.780
They got in

08:37.047 --> 08:45.380
contact with their state nursery there, you know, the forestry boys, and planted these little old trees and their little old scrawny things.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.664
Well, so was little Junior, his little old scrawny thing.

08:48.004 --> 08:51.811
They growed up together, and they was right proud of the whole deal.

08:52.592 --> 08:53.613
And I was, too.

08:54.174 --> 08:58.481
And we was all kind of watching this forest and the little old young'un there.

08:58.501 --> 09:00.304
He's a cute little fella.

09:00.993 --> 09:04.959
And then one day, friends, now this is a sad ending, but it's the truth.

09:05.680 --> 09:11.648
One day, some leatherhead out of town come driving down the highway sightseeing, you know, had his family out driving.

09:12.229 --> 09:16.275
He drove down the highway and flipped a lighted cigarette out the window.

09:16.595 --> 09:19.680
And now he had a cigarette tray right there in his car.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.502
There's no car made that I know of.

09:21.562 --> 09:26.589
It hadn't got a big, comfortable, handy cigarette tray in it.

09:27.751 --> 09:30.595
Got a cigarette tray right there at your fingertips.

09:30.963 --> 09:34.890
Instead of him using the cigarette tray, he threw the cigarette out the side.

09:35.591 --> 09:55.047
It caught the shoulder of the highway on fire, and the shoulder of the highway spread on into this young forest that was growing up with this youngster, and before we knew it, it had such a hold on us that all the neighbors and myself, we gathered up, we fought the fire, friends, we tried to stop it, but it had too big a lead on us, we just couldn't do nothing with it.

09:56.225 --> 09:57.948
You should have seen the results.

09:57.968 --> 09:58.609
It was awful.

09:59.010 --> 10:00.272
It was just terrible.

10:00.352 --> 10:04.198
Now, there sat this young married couple down there, squalling, crying.

10:04.238 --> 10:04.939
I don't blame them.

10:05.020 --> 10:06.602
I sat down there and cried with them.

10:07.123 --> 10:08.806
It was a sight to see.

10:08.826 --> 10:11.791
They'd worked so hard to this point, and then it got burned off.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.414
But they didn't give up, friends.

10:13.434 --> 10:14.455
They didn't give up.

10:14.475 --> 10:16.459
They went right back and tried it again.

10:16.799 --> 10:17.701
It's just like you or me.

10:17.721 --> 10:20.525
If our house burns down, we can't afford to move out under a shade tree.

10:20.545 --> 10:21.507
We've got to build another house.

10:22.094 --> 10:23.518
And they done the same thing.

10:23.538 --> 10:24.962
Now, here's the next tune.

10:24.982 --> 10:26.166
Let's see.

10:26.808 --> 10:27.851
I believe it's still, man.

10:27.891 --> 10:28.212
Charlie.

10:28.232 --> 10:30.679
Yeah, Miss Tyler's little boy.

10:30.699 --> 10:31.943
Charlie's going to sing this one.

10:31.963 --> 10:34.450
Here it is, my little rock candy baby.

10:40.538 --> 10:46.111
She's my little rock candy baby, way down in Arkansas.

10:46.632 --> 10:53.046
There's heaven in her eyes, she's my paradise, she's gonna be my all.

10:53.066 --> 10:58.699
Together we'll stroll in the evening, right down Little Rock Lane.

10:58.679 --> 11:04.364
Happy we'll be, my baby and me, my little rock candy baby.

11:04.985 --> 11:10.990
I can see her standing by my side, she's holding to my hand.

11:11.350 --> 11:16.895
Says I do as she replies to the parson in command.

11:16.915 --> 11:22.801
Well, I know I'll always love her, I long for her each day.

11:23.461 --> 11:27.825
I'm gonna go back to old Arkansas, my little rock candy baby.

11:52.139 --> 11:59.290
I can see her standing by my side, she's holding to my hand.

11:59.470 --> 12:05.199
She says I do as she replies to the parson in command.

12:05.259 --> 12:11.288
Well, I know I'll always love her, I long for her each day.

12:11.849 --> 12:17.337
I'm gonna go back to old Arkansas, my little rock candy baby.

12:18.177 --> 12:19.900
Well, all right there, Charlie boy.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.182
Thank you a whole lot there.

12:21.482 --> 12:27.832
Hope you friends enjoyed that little ditty called My Little Rock Candy Baby, done by the one and only Charlie Tyler.

12:28.072 --> 12:30.196
Here's just a little thought for the day, friends.

12:30.216 --> 12:34.442
We're about to run out of time, and I want to leave this little thought with you before we have to shove off here.

12:36.165 --> 12:44.438
For our own well-being and the country's sake, let's keep careless fires down and give the trees a break.

12:53.918 --> 12:55.801
Well, friends, we've run out of time here.

12:55.821 --> 12:56.762
We're going to have to go.

12:57.143 --> 13:02.951
We've enjoyed our little visit with you here under the old pine tree, and we hope that you've enjoyed it too.

13:02.971 --> 13:04.453
We want you to tune us in again.

13:04.533 --> 13:09.741
Listen to your station announcer, and he'll let you know the exact date and time that we'll be back.

13:09.761 --> 13:22.980
And don't forget this program, friends, is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your state forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:23.213 --> 13:29.666
And remember, friends, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:29.686 --> 13:30.490
Hey!

13:53.167 --> 13:53.589
.

13:53.610 --> 13:53.710
.

13:53.730 --> 14:00.409
.
