00:20.703 --> 00:27.053
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:27.434 --> 00:29.157
That's why they call him Smokey.

00:29.177 --> 00:30.900
That was how he got his name.

00:31.420 --> 00:32.242
Hi there, friends.

00:32.342 --> 00:34.285
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman.

00:34.906 --> 00:36.649
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:37.270 --> 00:42.318
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:42.338 --> 00:44.021
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:45.002 --> 00:47.807
That's cause we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:48.715 --> 00:54.408
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:54.428 --> 01:04.210
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the Sons of the Pioneers.

01:12.070 --> 01:21.422
Let me ride on the train.

01:33.468 --> 01:59.526
Where the coyotes wail in the globulin' For it's there that my heart's at home For it's there that my heart

02:03.151 --> 02:32.989
In the night In the night Let me rest Let me rest With a blue sky For my ceiling Tell the wind's lullaby

02:33.982 --> 03:03.381
Come stealing From the hills Where my heart's at home Wake with the song Wake with the sun Saddle to men Cattle to ten Plenty to be done

03:07.208 --> 03:23.412
Let me live on the range where a man has moved.

03:30.580 --> 03:50.909
And dream of his love in the gloaming in the hills of old Wyoming.

03:50.929 --> 03:54.073
In the hills of old Wyoming.

04:03.183 --> 04:09.910
Wyoming.

04:09.930 --> 04:13.193
Well, sir, I promised you some songs and a bit of storytelling.

04:14.395 --> 04:15.356
Here's a little story.

04:16.237 --> 04:19.860
Not exactly a nice story, but I think you ought to know about it.

04:21.142 --> 04:24.525
This happened just a little while back in heavy-tempered country.

04:25.907 --> 04:31.873
A forest fire running wild raced 14 miles all in the early morning hours.

04:32.343 --> 04:34.865
through the timber and through a little logging town.

04:35.966 --> 04:39.930
It swept the sawmill that the folks depended upon for their living.

04:39.950 --> 04:43.454
It burned up logging trucks and destroyed a dozen or more homes.

04:44.635 --> 04:49.539
All the folks in town, nearly a thousand of them, had to be evacuated.

04:49.620 --> 04:55.765
For 14 miles, that fire blazed a mile-wide strip of logged off land and green timber.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.468
And do you know how the fire started?

04:59.579 --> 05:02.882
Someone went off and left a warming fire without putting it out.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.525
It could have been a youngster waiting for the school bus.

05:07.586 --> 05:10.809
Might have been a couple of early rising hunters.

05:10.829 --> 05:13.592
It could have been some loggers waiting for the ride to the job.

05:15.053 --> 05:18.636
Well, whoever left their warming fire without putting it out?

05:18.656 --> 05:22.440
What a terrible price to pay for carelessness.

05:22.460 --> 05:28.185
Land once green and productive, like the early day traveler found in the state of Illinois.

05:30.258 --> 05:35.007
Way down upon the Wabash, such land was never known.

05:35.969 --> 05:42.020
If Adam had passed over it, the soil he'd surely own.

05:42.040 --> 05:47.170
He'd think it was the garden he played in when a boy

05:47.487 --> 05:52.595
and straight pronounce it Eden in the state of Illinois.

05:53.056 --> 06:03.614
Then move your family westward, good health you will enjoy, and rise to wealth and honor in the state of Illinois.

06:04.836 --> 06:13.630
T'was here the Queen of Sheba came with Solomon of old, with a donkey load of spices, pomegranates,

06:14.032 --> 06:16.014
And fine gold.

06:16.575 --> 06:22.481
And when she saw this lovely land, her heart was filled with joy.

06:23.302 --> 06:28.187
Straightway she said, I'd like to be a queen in Illinois.

06:28.668 --> 06:30.890
Then move your family westward.

06:31.171 --> 06:33.193
Good health you will enjoy.

06:33.233 --> 06:38.979
And rise to wealth and honor in the state of Illinois.

06:40.361 --> 06:42.503
She's bounded by the Wabash.

06:42.972 --> 06:44.901
the Ohio and the lakes.

06:45.825 --> 06:50.788
She's crawfish in the swampy lands, the milk sick and the shakes.

06:51.713 --> 07:02.223
But these are slight diversions, and take not from the joy of living in this garden land, the state of Illinois.

07:02.743 --> 07:14.434
Then move your family westward, good health you will enjoy, and rise to wealth and honor in the state of Illinois.

07:14.454 --> 07:19.358
Of course, everybody loves his own state.

07:20.063 --> 07:23.847
Wonderful things in pretty land to be found in every state.

07:25.228 --> 07:27.310
All the more reason we've got to take care of them.

07:28.712 --> 07:40.464
I know what a temptation it is on a cold morning to start a little fire alongside the road to keep your hands and feet warm, waiting for the school bus or a ride or that hunting partner of yours.

07:41.565 --> 07:44.788
Now, in some states, it's against the law to even have a warming fire.

07:45.359 --> 07:51.465
and it would be a very good idea for you to check with your local fire warden or ranger on that.

07:51.485 --> 07:55.849
And certainly it's against the law in every state to go away and leave a burning fire.

07:57.090 --> 07:58.932
You want to say something on this subject, Lloyd?

07:59.332 --> 08:10.803
All this talk about school buses, logging trucks, and the like reminds us of an early-day form of travel, back when there was no smooth, fast highways and no airmail service.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.425
That was back in the days, as the records will show,

08:13.979 --> 08:18.895
when we had a lot less carelessness with fire than we seem to be having today.

08:18.915 --> 08:24.192
Of course, there were a lot less people around when the Pony Express was running with Bill Cody in the saddles.

08:28.492 --> 08:50.989
in every corner of this world they boast of men's abode from captain blood and mr mud to england's kings of old by every place i've ever been they think their man's the best but listen while i introduce an old man from the west a thunderbolt bus and then a big cloud of dust and outrides roadie of the pony express

08:51.155 --> 08:57.963
Totin' the male beside him, he knows the trail to guide him, Cody of the Pony Express.

08:58.464 --> 09:05.993
Now the Indians wait by the canyon's gate to take Bill by surprise, but they'll never beat the Mustang feet of the fastest horse alive.

09:06.294 --> 09:14.064
So over the rim, he's runnin', racin' the wind, he's comin', Cody of the Pony Express.

09:14.084 --> 09:17.668
I once saw Cody fight his way through a thousand Indian braids.

09:17.648 --> 09:21.613
Riding on a two-ton buffalo's back, he's jumped, dug an Indian's grave.

09:21.633 --> 09:25.518
Then he took a half hitch in a buffalo's tail, and he swung him around and around.

09:25.538 --> 09:29.363
He said, step up, coach, you wildgaloops, I'll moor you down.

09:29.383 --> 09:36.653
A thunderbolt bust, and then a big cloud of dust, and out rides roadie up the Pony Express.

09:36.633 --> 10:03.889
Totin' the mail beside him, he knows the trail to guide him Cody of the Pony Express Now the engines wait for the canyon's gate to take Will by surprise But they'll never beat the Mustang beat of the fastest horse alive So does the rim, he's runnin', racin' the wind He's comin', Cody of the Pony Express Cody of the Pony Express

10:08.155 --> 10:12.582
That Bill Cody, or Buffalo Bill as he is best known, sure got around.

10:13.443 --> 10:18.591
He was a real outdoors man and a great friend of the early day foresters.

10:18.611 --> 10:23.177
He knew how valuable our forests and rangelands were in the building of the nation.

10:24.379 --> 10:33.192
So he was in complete sympathy with the principles of forest conservation and with keeping our timber and grasslands free from wildfire.

10:33.212 --> 10:37.639
You can bet your life that when Bill Cody made a little fire to cook on or to warm himself,

10:37.923 --> 10:45.573
He took every precaution possible to keep that fire safe, and he put it out, dead out, when he was through with it.

10:45.593 --> 10:54.746
The days of Buffalo Bill are legend now, but the need for playing it safe with fire, especially warming fire, is even more important today.

10:55.587 --> 11:02.496
Let's face it, today there are more people using more products from forest and rain, so we've just got to be extra careful.

11:03.658 --> 11:04.639
Think about this, will you?

11:05.294 --> 11:11.502
while we do a bit of traveling with the Sons of the Pioneers.

11:12.684 --> 11:18.131
I'll hop up on my pony and I'll ride away down the trail to San Antone.

11:18.952 --> 11:24.720
I can see her standing waiting by the garden gate and she waits for me alone.

11:25.730 --> 11:28.799
Through the plains and o'er the hills we'll ride, ride, ride.

11:29.140 --> 11:32.009
I won't rest until I have her by my side.

11:32.310 --> 11:35.018
Roll on, little pony, let that old wind moan.

11:35.479 --> 11:40.414
I'm heading back to San Antonio, down the trail to San Antonio.

11:41.879 --> 11:47.889
I just received a letter from my gal in San Antone that said that she would be my bride.

11:48.611 --> 11:54.561
I know she really loves me and her heart is true, so I guess I'd better take a ride.

11:55.242 --> 12:00.811
I'll hop up on my pony and I'll ride away down the trail to San Antone.

12:01.673 --> 12:07.583
I can see her standing waiting by the garden gate and she waits for me alone.

12:08.542 --> 12:11.686
Through the plains and over the hills we'll ride, ride, ride.

12:12.007 --> 12:14.890
I won't rest until I have her by my side.

12:15.231 --> 12:17.994
Roll on, little pony, let that old wind roll.

12:18.455 --> 12:22.040
I'm heading back to San Antonio.

12:22.060 --> 12:30.290
Down the trail to San Antonio.

12:30.310 --> 12:32.653
Well, would you look who's coming up the trail now.

12:32.854 --> 12:36.979
Big as life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all togged out in dungarees.

12:37.634 --> 12:39.777
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

12:40.157 --> 12:44.823
He's the popular candidate, the people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:45.664 --> 12:48.887
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:48.907 --> 12:50.609
Hello there, friends.

12:51.090 --> 12:56.036
Do you know that I'm the only candidate in the country that's completely nonpartisan?

12:56.056 --> 12:57.097
Yes, sir.

12:57.117 --> 13:02.123
I'm the only one who's qualified to get the support of youngsters as well as growing up.

13:02.558 --> 13:09.787
So all you folks who build a warming fire now and then, I need your help, no matter how young or old you are.

13:10.268 --> 13:13.893
I need your help in keeping that fire from running wild.

13:14.313 --> 13:15.815
Can I count on your support?

13:16.456 --> 13:17.197
I hope so.

13:17.958 --> 13:21.102
Well, I'll be seeing you.

13:21.122 --> 13:22.724
And there he goes down the trail.

13:23.565 --> 13:24.626
Thank you, Smokey.

13:26.209 --> 13:29.713
Well, friends, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:30.368 --> 13:32.992
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:33.973 --> 13:42.605
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:43.487 --> 13:54.302
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:54.763 --> 13:56.325
Remember, only we.

13:56.744 --> 14:00.870
you and I can prevent forest, woods, and range fires.

14:01.190 --> 14:10.322
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, growlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:10.342 --> 14:14.127
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

14:14.488 --> 14:18.593
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:19.254 --> 14:23.680
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

14:23.660 --> 14:32.491
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

14:32.592 --> 14:34.855
That's why they call him Smokey.

14:34.875 --> 14:50.595
That was how he got his name.

14:50.879 --> 14:54.139
Oh, my God.
