WEBVTT

00:10.780 --> 00:12.437
All right, here we go.

00:35.789 --> 00:39.695
Well, thank you, boys.

00:39.735 --> 00:40.396
Thank you a lot.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.298
Friends, you guessed it.

00:41.318 --> 00:41.738
Yes, sir.

00:42.039 --> 00:44.563
It's time once again for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads.

00:44.863 --> 00:51.594
Friends, we're coming to you right out from under the big old oak tree out here on the bank of good old Ouachita River.

00:51.874 --> 00:52.275
Yes, sir.

00:52.295 --> 00:56.341
The Knotheads and myself are just having a big time, and we hope that you are.

00:56.782 --> 01:01.189
Now, we've got some tunes all lined up here for you, friends, on the program that we think you're going to like.

01:01.456 --> 01:05.868
So if you ain't doing nothing for a few minutes, well, just drag up a chair there and relax and enjoy it.

01:05.888 --> 01:06.831
Here we go with the first one.

01:06.871 --> 01:08.074
It's kind of an old-timer.

01:08.596 --> 01:11.725
Yes, sir, don't guess it'll ever get old, and Jack does a mighty good job on it.

01:11.745 --> 01:13.710
It's called Ida Red, Jack.

01:15.513 --> 01:18.617
Oh, really, son, I see.

01:18.637 --> 01:39.426
The chicken and the bread taste nothing out, no granny, will you, don't bite, no town, no.

01:39.826 --> 01:41.048
Hey!

01:45.584 --> 01:51.438
Whoa, Bob!

01:51.458 --> 02:01.703
Whoa!

02:05.986 --> 02:26.222
Oh, pity out there, son, pity out.

02:26.607 --> 02:32.014
Well, all right, Ted Jackson, that's mighty fine fiddle play in there, son.

02:32.034 --> 02:33.095
Thank you a whole lot.

02:33.115 --> 02:34.998
Now, you boys be real quiet there now.

02:35.038 --> 02:38.623
Just see how quiet you can be, because I got something on my chest here that I want to get off.

02:38.703 --> 02:44.730
You know, I'm standing here, friends, right on the bank of the Ouachita River, leaned up against a little post oak tree.

02:45.251 --> 02:46.673
It's full of moss.

02:47.614 --> 02:48.455
It really is pretty.

02:49.076 --> 02:52.220
It's a lot prettier, though, in the spring of the year.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.403
And, well, I just saw...

02:55.244 --> 02:57.026
Bass strike out there in the river.

02:57.247 --> 03:02.033
Along about this time of day, they usually strike more.

03:02.053 --> 03:05.998
Speaking of times, I can't help but think how times is changing.

03:06.940 --> 03:13.769
Right here in this particular place, friends, it ain't been many years ago, that people would burn these woods over every year.

03:14.730 --> 03:15.151
Every year.

03:15.191 --> 03:16.092
They never missed a year.

03:16.132 --> 03:23.682
They thought they had to burn them over for the ticks and snakes and boll weevils, red bugs, insects.

03:24.353 --> 03:28.397
Now, they thought they had to burn these woods to get rid of these insects.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.539
And I can't help but think how times is changing.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.681
They don't do that anymore.

03:33.442 --> 03:37.126
There hasn't been a fire in this section around here in years.

03:37.847 --> 03:43.092
We got some of these pretty timbers as there is anywhere because we'll keep the fire out of it.

03:43.112 --> 03:47.116
That's about the foolishest thing I ever heard of, burning the woods to burn up.

03:47.196 --> 03:50.399
Can you imagine somebody burning up the woods to burn up a boll weevil?

03:51.180 --> 03:53.162
The boll weevil's got more sense than he has.

03:53.699 --> 03:57.703
He'll get down in an old, wet, soggy chunk, and there's where he'll stay.

03:57.783 --> 04:00.686
You can burn and re-burn, but you'll never burn up that bo weevil.

04:01.607 --> 04:11.717
And another thing you can remember back, I know a lot of you can, when they used to burn to get rid of these snakes and bo weevils, they still had them every year.

04:12.438 --> 04:14.580
They never did get rid of them.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.623
So it was all a foolish thing.

04:16.643 --> 04:20.146
And then think of all the good timber that they burned up.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.968
Well, if they hadn't burned years ago,

04:22.775 --> 04:33.647
If they had to handle the woods years ago like they handle them now, and are learning to handle them, why, we'd have some of the finest timber in the world, which we have got some, but we need more.

04:34.448 --> 04:39.273
And we've got to take care of this young timber to take the place of the old timber that we cut off.

04:40.895 --> 04:46.301
I've known of cases where a man wanted to burn all around his house to get rid of the snakes.

04:46.341 --> 04:47.342
He was afraid of snakes.

04:48.123 --> 04:52.107
Well, when he goes out and sets fire to the grass patch or the woods,

04:52.441 --> 04:53.863
The snake, he knows what to do.

04:54.303 --> 04:59.611
He goes down in a hole, and the fire passes over, and after the fire's gone, well, he comes out of the hole.

05:00.011 --> 05:05.058
You come along down through there, and the ground's black, and he's black, and you step on him, and he bites you.

05:05.078 --> 05:06.400
So you just can't win.

05:07.501 --> 05:09.444
It just don't pay to burn the woods.

05:10.605 --> 05:19.277
As I was saying, I'm here on the bank of the river, friend, and I am right on the bank of Ouachita River, right here in the woods where I love it.

05:19.577 --> 05:21.840
I really do love it, and I wish that all of you

05:22.124 --> 05:23.365
Loved it as well as I do.

05:24.106 --> 05:27.970
If you did, I'll guarantee you that you'd take better care of the woods.

05:29.272 --> 05:33.376
Be careful with your matches and cigarettes, campfires, all that sort of stuff.

05:33.957 --> 05:36.900
Now you think that over, friends, and keep it in mind.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.442
Times is changing.

05:38.462 --> 05:45.550
Well, I wanted to tell you some more about that, but I guess we better, the boys is frowning at me here, so I guess I better let one of them sing, Louis especially.

05:45.968 --> 05:50.093
He's a gouging in my ribs here, so here he goes for the tune he does a good job on.

05:50.554 --> 05:50.934
How?

05:51.675 --> 05:53.297
Oh, yes, just a minute, son, just a minute.

05:53.317 --> 05:54.498
I'll get to go ahead and see it out of the way.

05:54.759 --> 05:56.761
Lewis is going to do How, Can I Be Sure?

06:05.252 --> 06:12.921
You only want to break my heart once more

06:13.525 --> 06:20.397
But promises that you'll keep every vow.

06:21.541 --> 06:29.435
You told me that you loved me so many times before.

06:29.755 --> 06:38.009
So how can I be sure you love me now?

06:38.029 --> 06:45.422
Sometimes I dream I'm in your arms embraced.

06:46.060 --> 06:53.229
And oh how happy you once made me there.

06:54.291 --> 07:01.961
But every time I trust in you, another takes my place.

07:02.361 --> 07:09.891
So how can I be sure you really care?

07:19.321 --> 07:40.283
Thank you.

07:43.283 --> 07:51.593
And I'm only sure I'll never love anew.

07:51.613 --> 07:59.982
Your memory is in my heart to stay.

08:00.002 --> 08:06.810
And foolish me, I'll still be here with open arms for you.

08:07.617 --> 08:16.348
For how can I be sure you'll stay away?

08:16.368 --> 08:17.509
Well, all right there, Lewis.

08:17.530 --> 08:18.411
Thank you, son.

08:18.511 --> 08:19.592
Thank you.

08:19.612 --> 08:21.735
Yeah, that's pretty good carrying on there.

08:21.755 --> 08:23.637
If y'all don't mind, friends, I'll have a seat here.

08:25.039 --> 08:28.183
And, of course, it's going to take several minutes to get this over with.

08:29.485 --> 08:35.712
Yes, they're thinking about burning the woods over, though, friends, for boll weevils, ticks, and snakes, and all kinds of insects.

08:35.732 --> 08:36.173
That's...

08:36.541 --> 09:00.557
so silly you know as i said times is changing you know there's still a lot of people burn because their grandfather burned and their great grandfather burned he thought it was right he really did and they're burning because he burned and they still think it's right but it's not right it's wrong see times is changing we're learning more and more about these things every day just like a piece of a machinery

09:00.993 --> 09:02.936
They perfect it better and better every day.

09:02.956 --> 09:08.306
Automobiles 10 years ago wouldn't make over 25 or 30 miles an hour, but now they'll go over 100.

09:08.406 --> 09:09.708
That's just cruising speed.

09:10.229 --> 09:11.471
I mean, they're getting bigger and better.

09:11.972 --> 09:14.196
Well, the same thing applies to the woods.

09:14.216 --> 09:24.334
We're learning more and more about these pine trees and how to grow them, how to take care of them, how to get the most out of them, when to cut them, when they'll bring the most money, all that sort of stuff.

09:24.685 --> 09:32.854
And you don't see many people that burns the woods for ticks and snakes and boll weevils anymore where they've got things to catch them with and they've got different poisons to kill them.

09:33.534 --> 09:40.742
And it's foolish to start with because you can't burn up a tick or a boll weevil or a snake or anything like that.

09:40.762 --> 09:41.022
Why ticks?

09:41.042 --> 09:44.486
That's the foolishest thing I ever heard of, burning the woods to kill ticks.

09:44.506 --> 09:47.829
Maybe you do kill a few ticks, but what if you do?

09:47.849 --> 09:54.456
Why, you'd have to get out and burn up all the turtles and catch all the deer and burn them up and you'd have to catch the rabbits and squirrels

09:54.875 --> 10:00.622
Everything cause all kinds of animals that roam around in the woods has got a few ticks on them But what is a tick?

10:00.642 --> 10:18.385
I've had lots of them bite me Ain't no reason for me to go out and set the woods on fire and try to burn them up No, I believe I'd prefer scratching a little bit than setting the woods on fire And I believe friends if you'll just sit down there and think about it and think how many

10:19.040 --> 10:20.442
Little trees you destroy.

10:21.002 --> 10:22.604
And then think of other things.

10:22.644 --> 10:25.228
There's the food that's in the woods for the wildlife.

10:25.268 --> 10:26.129
Now you take hogs.

10:26.169 --> 10:27.050
I got some hogs.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.472
I got some grunters around here.

10:28.492 --> 10:29.793
I got some prize hogs.

10:30.594 --> 10:31.595
Friends, that's no kidding.

10:31.635 --> 10:33.718
I raise prize hogs out here at the hooker hole.

10:34.239 --> 10:36.201
They go around two, two at a time.

10:36.221 --> 10:38.163
They pair off.

10:38.183 --> 10:48.456
And the reason I call them prize hogs, one of them will stick his nose under a root, and when he does, it raises his hind feet up off the ground, and the other one hops up on his

10:48.807 --> 10:52.491
hips there, and it prizes a root up out of the ground.

10:52.511 --> 10:54.694
And I call them prize holes.

10:55.735 --> 10:56.877
Friends, you can't win.

10:57.697 --> 10:59.620
Times is changing.

10:59.640 --> 11:05.867
And that old way of burning for ticks and snakes and seed ticks and things, times has changed.

11:05.887 --> 11:07.048
Well, here we go with another tune.

11:07.069 --> 11:15.979
This one features Herman, our little steel guitar player, and he's doing an old steel standard steel guitar rag, Herman.

11:19.435 --> 11:26.865
Come on, Hamilton, son.

11:26.925 --> 11:44.650
Let's go there, little boy.

12:01.505 --> 12:12.695
My mercy, son, Mr. Dottie!

12:13.536 --> 12:15.558
Woo-hoo!

12:16.459 --> 12:29.571
Woo-hoo!

12:44.519 --> 12:48.042
Well, all right there.

12:48.062 --> 12:50.244
Son, that is what I call a mess of steel.

12:50.745 --> 12:52.947
That was his, I'm telling you, that was all right.

12:52.987 --> 12:53.868
Thank you a lot, Herman.

12:54.388 --> 12:55.670
Friends, we're running out of time.

12:56.370 --> 12:57.371
And we've got to go, you know.

12:57.772 --> 13:00.414
There comes a time when all good things come to an end.

13:00.434 --> 13:01.575
Well, this one's got the end, too.

13:02.336 --> 13:03.437
We're going to have to go, friends.

13:03.457 --> 13:08.642
But before we go, there's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you, friends, before we go.

13:09.723 --> 13:12.526
I'm telling you what I know, believe it or not.

13:12.546 --> 13:14.087
You can call me friend or liar.

13:14.708 --> 13:31.232
But it's just as true as I'm standing here that you can't ever win with wildfowl.

13:48.357 --> 13:52.823
Well, friends, that brings to an end our little visit here with you under the old oak tree.

13:53.724 --> 13:56.147
We sure have enjoyed it, and we hope that you have.

13:56.548 --> 13:57.429
We'll be back soon.

13:57.890 --> 13:59.572
Listen to the announcer, and he'll let you know.

14:00.733 --> 14:13.009
Friends, don't forget this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

14:13.029 --> 14:17.335
Remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

14:17.855 --> 14:19.613
All right, boys, let's go home here.
