00:00.000 --> 00:16.653
[Music.]

00:16.653 --> 00:22.653
The Texas Forest Service of A&M College brings you the story of Texas oil.

00:23.254 --> 00:39.586
[Music.]

00:39.586 --> 00:50.887
It was in the year 1867 that two men, Amory Starr and Peyton Edwards, were on a hunting trip in Nacogdoches County, about 15 miles southeast of the town of Nacogdoches.

00:51.428 --> 00:53.231
I guess I'll have to agree with you, Peyton.

00:53.572 --> 00:55.735
We haven't been very lucky today, that's for sure.

00:56.216 --> 00:59.542
I certainly hope we find a little something to shoot at tomorrow.

00:59.562 --> 01:02.067
Our trip's going to be kind of a failure as far as hunting goes.

01:02.333 --> 01:06.246
Yeah, and we didn't do too good a job picking a place to camp for the night either.

01:06.647 --> 01:08.253
Look how the water is in this stream.

01:08.474 --> 01:10.942
Seems to have a coat of grease of oil floating over.

01:10.962 --> 01:12.106
Yeah, it sure does.

01:12.126 --> 01:13.390
I wonder what causes that.

01:13.522 --> 01:14.664
I can't figure it out.

01:14.764 --> 01:17.128
There doesn't seem to be any oil above or below here.

01:17.349 --> 01:19.893
You suppose it's oil seeping out of the ground here?

01:20.494 --> 01:21.256
It might be.

01:21.536 --> 01:24.461
I haven't heard of any oil being found much down here in Texas.

01:24.842 --> 01:28.268
Of course, they've been getting it out of wells up there in Pennsylvania, or so I hear.

01:28.528 --> 01:29.730
You know what I think I'll do?

01:30.392 --> 01:33.337
I think I'll dig a few holes right around here in the ground tonight.

01:33.838 --> 01:36.863
I'd just like to see if any oil seeps into them by morning.

01:37.602 --> 01:41.227
You go ahead, and while you are doing that, I'm going to rustle up some food for us.

01:41.467 --> 01:42.929
Hand me over to that coffee pot, will you?

01:42.929 --> 01:49.198
[Music.]

01:49.198 --> 01:50.800
Hey, Amory, wake up.

01:50.820 --> 01:51.622
Got something to show you.

01:53.264 --> 01:53.344
Huh?

01:53.364 --> 01:53.905
Oh, good morning.

01:54.225 --> 01:54.866
What is it, Peyton?

01:55.046 --> 01:58.151
Well, them holes you dug last night, they've just about filled up with something.

01:59.092 --> 01:59.873
Let me take a look at them.

02:00.834 --> 02:02.537
Well, I'll be doggone.

02:02.617 --> 02:04.099
They sure have.

02:04.383 --> 02:07.406
Hey, looks like it's oil floating on top of some water there.

02:08.046 --> 02:09.747
Yep, it sure is.

02:09.848 --> 02:11.169
Hand me that can now, will you?

02:11.189 --> 02:11.869
What are you going to do?

02:12.650 --> 02:15.172
I think I'll skim it off and take it back to Nacogdoches with us.

02:15.692 --> 02:17.714
We might be able to sell it to the general store.

02:17.734 --> 02:19.175
Oh, what did anybody use it for?

02:19.536 --> 02:20.537
Well, I don't know.

02:20.877 --> 02:22.198
There ought to be some use for it.

02:22.718 --> 02:25.641
Chances are it'll be all right for harness oil.

02:30.745 --> 02:34.288
This, then, was the first commercial discovery of oil in Texas.

02:34.707 --> 02:40.643
For the next 25 years, oil wells were drilled in Texas, but production was small.

02:40.663 --> 02:45.115
There was San Antonio in 1889, McLennan County in 1890.

02:45.195 --> 02:51.231
Then came the year 1894.

02:55.328 --> 02:57.471
See, Pat, did you hear what happened to the Corsicana well?

02:57.652 --> 02:58.453
No, I didn't, George.

02:58.493 --> 02:58.994
What was it?

02:59.174 --> 03:02.480
Well, you knew the city was drilling artesian well to get city water, didn't you?

03:02.700 --> 03:04.463
Yeah, I knew they were after better water.

03:04.823 --> 03:05.745
Well, they hit oil.

03:06.406 --> 03:07.508
Oil?

03:07.528 --> 03:10.452
Well, I guess the city officials are pretty happy about that, aren't they?

03:10.472 --> 03:12.556
No, they're all disappointed because they wanted water.

03:12.896 --> 03:13.978
They're about to give up.

03:14.262 --> 03:17.309
All the people from miles around have been coming down to see the oil well.

03:17.710 --> 03:20.657
They can't seem to resist lighting matches to see if it's really oil.

03:21.278 --> 03:24.024
Managed to burn down three derricks already.

03:24.044 --> 03:25.888
Well, what does the city intend to do about it?

03:25.908 --> 03:28.514
Well, the city officials are bound and determined to get water.

03:28.935 --> 03:31.461
They're talking about casing the well to keep the oil out.

03:31.441 --> 03:33.203
Down to 2,200 feet now.

03:33.564 --> 03:35.526
What do the drilling contractors say about it?

03:35.546 --> 03:36.928
About to go crazy.

03:36.948 --> 03:39.751
After losing those three derricks, they're almost bankrupt.

03:39.771 --> 03:45.418
Well, maybe the city fathers want water, but sounds to me like there might be more money in the oil.

03:45.938 --> 03:51.905
Now, if we could drill just as close as possible to their well, George, we could... Now, you don't need to say another word, Pat.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.487
I'm convinced already.

03:53.507 --> 03:55.710
You and me are heading for Corsicana.

04:00.787 --> 04:04.232
The Corsicana strike started another flurry of drilling.

04:04.252 --> 04:08.758
1898, the first Texas refinery.

04:09.078 --> 04:11.281
1900, the Powell Field.

04:13.024 --> 04:19.432
And 1901, Captain Anthony F. Lucas was drilling in the spindletop field near Beaumont.

04:19.432 --> 04:26.962
[Music.]

04:26.962 --> 04:28.565
You better change the bit, Jack.

04:28.585 --> 04:29.646
All right, Captain Lucas.

04:30.014 --> 04:33.118
I think we'll have to run another section of the four-inch pipe in, too.

04:33.659 --> 04:34.621
How deep does that make us?

04:35.241 --> 04:38.446
About 1,160 feet.

04:38.466 --> 04:40.409
I've been noticing some oil is showing on the ditch.

04:41.691 --> 04:44.314
Yes, I've noticed it, but I don't think it means anything.

04:44.815 --> 04:46.477
Hope we get a real show pretty soon.

04:47.259 --> 04:51.685
I still think there's oil here at Spindletop, even if our other wells don't show anything.

04:52.446 --> 04:55.330
I want to go on down until I know whether or not...

04:58.955 --> 04:59.997
Hey, watch out, Captain.

05:00.097 --> 05:01.439
She's blowing in.

05:01.459 --> 05:02.480
Get back out of the way, men.

05:02.680 --> 05:03.962
Stay clear of the rocks and fight.

05:04.143 --> 05:05.164
What do you think it is, Captain?

05:05.224 --> 05:05.825
Only gas?

05:05.865 --> 05:07.527
No, no, there it is.

05:07.547 --> 05:09.550
That's the oil starting to come in now.

05:09.711 --> 05:11.854
By gollies, it sure is.

05:11.974 --> 05:14.497
Why, it's Spartan oil 200 feet high.

05:14.518 --> 05:18.263
Now I guess this is the biggest oil strike Texas has ever seen.

05:18.263 --> 05:26.000
[Music.]

05:26.000 --> 05:28.017
It was a big strike.

05:28.283 --> 05:31.407
Everybody in the oil business started talking about Texas.

05:31.787 --> 05:35.211
People came by the thousands to Beaumont to make some easy money in oil.

05:35.672 --> 05:38.215
More and more oil was being produced.

05:38.235 --> 05:40.417
But the Spindletop field was not alone.

05:40.778 --> 05:46.044
Nearly every year brought the discovery of new oil fields in Texas.

05:46.064 --> 05:49.228
1902, Hardin County.

05:49.597 --> 05:52.880
1904, Petrolia Field in Clay County.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.342
Every year, new fields.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.784
Every year, cheaper prices.

05:56.064 --> 06:00.248
Marion County, Electra Field, Moran and Strawn and Ranger Field.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.811
1920 with Burke Burnett and Desdemona.

06:03.211 --> 06:06.635
1920, nearly 100 million barrels of oil.

06:06.895 --> 06:09.358
Fabulous riches earned by enterprising companies.

06:09.778 --> 06:14.203
And hanging on the fringes of the oil industry were the get-rich-quick promoters.

06:19.516 --> 06:23.602
You know, I think there's a nice little deal that's just suited to our talents, Spike.

06:24.022 --> 06:25.104
Let's hear about it, Harry.

06:25.525 --> 06:27.487
It's this big oil boom down in Texas.

06:27.928 --> 06:29.510
It's about time we got in on it.

06:30.031 --> 06:31.152
Well, how do we go about it?

06:31.373 --> 06:37.221
Well, probably the best way to pay somebody a few dollars for an option on some land.

06:37.802 --> 06:40.265
Doesn't make any difference where the land is or what it is.

06:40.706 --> 06:42.148
Just so we get an option on it.

06:42.635 --> 06:46.720
Then we'd form a company and sell a lot of stock to the suckers up north.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.883
Yeah, sounds good to me.

06:49.344 --> 06:51.446
You figure on drilling for oil then?

06:51.667 --> 06:52.067
Drill?

06:52.568 --> 06:54.450
What do we want to drill for?

06:54.891 --> 06:59.296
We'll get some nice gilt-edged stock certificates printed up on some fancy paper.

06:59.937 --> 07:01.860
And that'll look good to the suckers.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.583
All you need is a fast line and some fancy certificates.

07:04.643 --> 07:06.485
And you clean up.

07:06.505 --> 07:08.908
After that gold mining stock, this should be simple.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.110
Yeah, it should be.

07:10.512 --> 07:15.560
You know, all these stories of oil strikes in the papers make good advertising for us, too.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.223
It should be easy money for a while.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.425
Easy money?

07:18.445 --> 07:31.005
Listen, Spike, I'll bet we unload a million dollars worth of phony paper before we're through.

07:31.025 --> 07:34.891
There were many people all right who lost their money in oil and oil stocks.

07:35.191 --> 07:36.874
But a lot of people made money, too.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.011
More and more wells were drilled.

07:39.411 --> 07:41.875
In 1920, the Mahea Field opened up.

07:42.376 --> 07:44.859
Every year or two came reports of other fields.

07:45.300 --> 07:52.691
Big Lake, Powell Field, Wortham, Howard County, Winkler and Raccoon Bend, Sugar Lake, Van Zandt County and Pettis.

07:53.512 --> 08:02.425
1930, and Dad Joyner discovered the East Texas Field, the biggest of them all, in Rusk County.

08:02.445 --> 08:03.146
More oil.

08:04.268 --> 08:05.089
More wells.

08:05.761 --> 08:06.642
Cheaper prices.

08:07.223 --> 08:08.044
More production.

08:08.544 --> 08:09.305
More wells.

08:09.725 --> 08:10.486
More fields.

08:10.927 --> 08:11.788
More oil.

08:12.429 --> 08:13.810
Rock bottom prices.

08:13.830 --> 08:22.700
300 million barrels of oil at 10 cents a barrel.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.542
The entire industry suffered.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.087
Then in 1931, Governor Ross S. Sterling took action.

08:30.209 --> 08:34.013
Commissioner, this situation in the East Texas oil field is reaching a crisis.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.205
There's considerable unrest and even threats of blowing up the wells and pipelines.

08:38.605 --> 08:47.857
Well, Governor, it's been the opinion of the Railroad Commission that if we could limit the amount of oil produced to the market demand, the entire situation would improve.

08:48.378 --> 08:52.683
According to the conservation law, the commission is only authorized to prevent physical waste.

08:53.625 --> 08:57.449
I still can't see how limiting production to market demand is justified.

08:57.730 --> 09:02.616
Well, the commission has reason to believe that oil is now being taken out of the ground too fast.

09:02.866 --> 09:08.531
The combined gas pressure and water pressure that forces the oil to the surface is dropping too rapidly.

09:09.112 --> 09:14.657
If the oil were taken from the ground more slowly, we could probably recover from half to three quarters of it.

09:15.298 --> 09:20.523
But if we let the pressure lose force too fast, we'll probably only be able to get a quarter of it.

09:21.163 --> 09:25.908
In other words, we'll lose nearly three quarters of the oil in the ground and we'll never be able to recover it.

09:26.709 --> 09:30.072
Well, whether or not you're right, Commissioner, I'm going to have to do something.

09:30.372 --> 09:34.919
For the time being, I'll expect the commission to issue orders on how much oil is to be produced.

09:35.761 --> 09:38.225
I'll be responsible myself for enforcing the orders.

09:39.146 --> 09:43.813
I'm going to order National Guard troops into East Texas and declare a state of martial law.

09:51.746 --> 09:57.375
The East Texas field was put under martial law, and all wells there were shut down.

09:57.878 --> 10:01.143
But the United States Supreme Court said this action was illegal.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.366
Troops were withdrawn.

10:03.386 --> 10:11.317
Then, for several years, the Railroad Commission tried to hold down oil production in the face of a large number of injunctions and court trials.

10:11.337 --> 10:25.236
Eventually, the governor called the legislature into a special session, and the Texas legislature added to the law the statement that the production of any more oil than could be sold on the market or than could be transported was waste.

10:25.705 --> 10:31.775
This new definition of waste gave the Railroad Commission the authority it needed to prevent the physical waste of oil.

10:32.376 --> 10:34.619
Prices increased with the controlled production.

10:35.300 --> 10:41.671
And the East Texas field, because of the stable production, continued to produce oil.

10:41.691 --> 10:45.337
Much more oil was being recovered than anyone had believed possible.

10:46.759 --> 10:48.562
Then came the year 1941.

10:48.622 --> 10:53.583
War.

10:53.583 --> 11:09.884
Oil had been used in the First World War, but in 1941, on the eve of the biggest struggle the world had ever known, oil assumed a role of tremendous importance.

11:09.884 --> 11:19.217
[Music.]

11:19.217 --> 11:23.202
General, it's going to take a lot of gasoline and oil to fight this war.

11:23.654 --> 11:29.481
To the extent to which we're mechanizing the army, we'll have to supply a lot of trucks and tanks and airplanes.

11:30.042 --> 11:33.205
We've got to figure on the Navy using a lot of oil, too.

11:33.225 --> 11:36.189
There'll soon be a terrific number of diesel-powered craft afloat.

11:36.589 --> 11:37.610
Yes, that's right, Major.

11:38.371 --> 11:41.195
But I think the United States can supply the oil.

11:41.915 --> 11:47.502
You know, we can count on nearly 750 million barrels of oil a year from Texas alone.

11:54.535 --> 11:56.738
Texas oil helped win the war all right.

11:57.199 --> 12:02.548
Millions upon millions of barrels of gasoline, oil, and diesel fuel were used.

12:02.568 --> 12:06.394
The petroleum industry now holds a vital place in the economy of the state.

12:07.115 --> 12:10.019
In the old days, nearly all derricks were built of wood.

12:10.720 --> 12:14.186
Even today, wood and oil have much in common.

12:14.206 --> 12:18.573
In fact, oil may have been wood at some time in the history of the earth.

12:19.334 --> 12:21.437
It is thought that in many cases,

12:21.822 --> 12:31.731
Oil may have originated from ancient forests which have been changed by the centuries through natural destructive distillation into the oil pools of today.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.594
Wood is now used in many ways to help the oil industry.

12:35.174 --> 12:42.141
Wood is used for forms for the concrete derrick and machinery foundations, for derrick flooring and for pipe racks.

12:42.161 --> 12:50.749
More wood is used for crating machinery, for piling for offshore drilling, and for railway ties for spur tracks running to oil refineries.

12:51.252 --> 12:56.219
Wooden telephone poles carry telephone lines along oil pipelines.

12:56.239 --> 12:57.741
According to Director W.E.

12:57.821 --> 13:12.281
White of the Texas Forest Service, millions of bored feet of Texas timber are used for houses for employees of the oil industry, for warehouses and office buildings, bringing an income to the timberland owners of the state.

13:13.082 --> 13:20.753
Thus, the forests of Texas work hand-in-hand with another Texas industry to benefit the people of the state.

13:22.893 --> 13:39.750
A constant supply of timber can build a greater Texas.

13:39.770 --> 13:48.058
