WEBVTT

00:14.678 --> 00:39.461
Sold out, Doc.

00:39.501 --> 00:40.602
Another soul made happy.

00:40.642 --> 00:41.783
How do you do, friends?

00:42.218 --> 00:43.440
Yes, sir.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.381
How do you do?

00:44.741 --> 00:46.303
Well, yes, sir, you guessed it again.

00:47.184 --> 00:51.750
It's Jelly Elliott, the old woods rider, and all the knotheads gathered up here on the old pine tree.

00:52.611 --> 01:03.785
We're going to be coming your way for the next few minutes, so gather yourself up there and take it easy in a good easy chair and pour yourself a cup of coffee or anything there and relax for just a few minutes.

01:03.805 --> 01:07.770
We're going to play some of these tunes that we've had most requests for.

01:09.016 --> 01:13.322
Here we go with the first one, and I think it features Bob on his strata-potato fiddle.

01:13.342 --> 01:14.483
Yes, sir.

01:14.503 --> 01:18.589
I've heard of strata-various fiddles, but Bob's got a strata-potato fiddle.

01:18.649 --> 01:20.371
And here he goes with Bill Cheatham.

01:28.702 --> 01:36.492
Hear that, boss!

01:51.642 --> 01:51.822
.

01:51.842 --> 01:51.883
.

01:52.083 --> 01:52.323
.

01:52.344 --> 02:06.715
.

02:09.884 --> 02:14.754
Thank you, Bob, and thank you, boys.

02:14.994 --> 02:16.097
That was Bill Cheatham.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.041
Only it was a little too short there, Bob.

02:18.401 --> 02:19.263
You ought to kept going.

02:19.864 --> 02:25.496
Now, friends, I want to bring in these forestry boys right on this particular incident here.

02:25.516 --> 02:30.947
They're trained to do special jobs of managing forest and woodland and...

02:31.383 --> 02:33.186
For all kinds of good.

02:33.367 --> 02:35.591
They're trained and they know what they're doing.

02:35.611 --> 02:40.641
They're not out cutting a tree for trying to get a squirrel or something like that.

02:41.022 --> 02:48.075
They're in this thing for the timber, the water, wildlife, the grazing, recreation, and all that sort of stuff.

02:49.422 --> 02:58.131
But today, friends, I wanted to talk to you about a local forester, or a farm forester, or some of the folks know these fellas as service foresters.

02:58.151 --> 03:00.233
And I want to tell you all about this local forester.

03:00.834 --> 03:02.816
He's a human being just like you and me.

03:02.836 --> 03:05.138
He's a regular fella, just an old country boy.

03:05.158 --> 03:08.882
In fact, he's got to be a country boy to know what he knows.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.824
And I want to tell you all about him.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.287
He's doing a job not for himself.

03:14.650 --> 03:16.733
But it's for you and for me.

03:16.753 --> 03:17.875
And I want to tell you all about it.

03:17.895 --> 03:19.157
But first, here's the tune.

03:19.178 --> 03:21.121
I'm going to sing this next one for you, friends.

03:21.141 --> 03:22.663
Here it is.

03:22.683 --> 03:24.106
Wandering what's over the hill.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.583
Wandering down.

03:39.676 --> 04:08.080
Wondering what's over the hill Don't know what I'm searching for Don't know that I ever will Someday I'll find Someone who's kind

04:13.460 --> 04:28.296
will be mine I'll wander down the railroad track and I'll find what's over the hill

04:52.627 --> 04:53.769
.

04:53.789 --> 04:55.172
.

04:55.192 --> 04:59.219
.

04:59.319 --> 05:13.504
.

05:30.595 --> 05:49.515
Don't know what I'm saying

05:53.208 --> 06:10.086
know that I will someday I'll find someone who's kind someone to

06:23.195 --> 06:28.164
And I'll find what's over the hill.

06:30.628 --> 06:31.670
Well, there it is, friends.

06:31.690 --> 06:32.331
Thank you, boys.

06:32.352 --> 06:33.854
Thank you a lot.

06:33.874 --> 06:41.608
I'm just wondering if you people know or realize what a good friend you have there in your community, and that's your farm forester.

06:41.628 --> 06:43.351
Most people call them farm foresters.

06:43.812 --> 06:47.599
Some of them call them local forestry, and some of them calls them forestry boys.

06:48.068 --> 06:53.616
Friends, I wanted to tell you about a little trip I was taking the other day with a local forester, Jim Langford.

06:54.097 --> 06:55.960
You know, Jim and me is pretty good friends.

06:56.601 --> 07:04.612
And Jim comes by and picks me up a lot of times when he goes out on different calls and to different places to check on different things.

07:05.334 --> 07:09.500
Now, Jim has went through college, and he's studied all this sort of thing.

07:09.540 --> 07:10.461
He's been in the woods.

07:10.481 --> 07:11.803
He's born and raised in the woods.

07:11.823 --> 07:14.447
He's a country boy, and he knows what he's doing.

07:15.355 --> 07:19.600
Well, when we got there, when we got to where we was going, we found that it was a farmer.

07:20.220 --> 07:22.303
Farmer had called us.

07:22.783 --> 07:31.733
But when we got there, we checked and found out it was the farmer's 13-year-old boy who put his daddy up to ask Jim to come out there and look over this woodland.

07:32.394 --> 07:33.575
That little boy.

07:33.595 --> 07:34.556
And why did he do it?

07:34.596 --> 07:37.319
Because he's getting it in school, and he studies it.

07:37.400 --> 07:44.147
In fact, I'll tell you, friends, you know, the kids is a lot smarter nowadays, and people give them credit for being.

07:44.212 --> 07:45.313
The kid was smart.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.134
He was really smart.

07:46.575 --> 07:49.058
So he got his daddy to call Jim out.

07:49.078 --> 07:51.201
So Jim and me went out.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.884
Jim come by and pick me up, and we went out to see this farmer.

07:54.686 --> 07:56.808
And we went all over the woods.

07:56.828 --> 08:04.298
Jim and me and the kid and his daddy went all over the woods, in the hardwoods and in some places, young pine and others.

08:04.318 --> 08:09.004
And, well, he had a mixed variety of timber there.

08:08.984 --> 08:15.895
Now, this farmer told Jim how he hated to have him waste time and come out there and all this sort of stuff.

08:15.915 --> 08:21.404
And Jim just laughed a little, and he told him, he said, look, friend, he said, this is my job.

08:21.424 --> 08:25.030
And he said, if I can really help you, I won't be wasting any time.

08:25.891 --> 08:29.397
In fact, I'm tickled to death to come out if I can help you.

08:29.417 --> 08:34.785
So the farmer said that he'd been offered what he thought was a pretty good price.

08:35.406 --> 08:36.628
In fact, quite...

08:37.182 --> 08:40.087
some money for this hardwood.

08:40.908 --> 08:42.972
Well, he wasn't going to touch the pines at all.

08:42.992 --> 08:44.354
He was just going to sell the hardwood.

08:44.835 --> 08:48.240
He was going to wait for these pines to grow up the soil timber.

08:48.260 --> 08:50.163
And the timber was awful thick, friends.

08:50.183 --> 08:51.245
It was awful thick.

08:51.766 --> 08:58.317
Well, so when Jim walked through it and all, he looked it over and he showed this farmer how to measure trees.

08:58.617 --> 09:01.903
He showed him how to measure trees and how to figure out how much he had.

09:02.824 --> 09:03.325
And, uh,

09:04.688 --> 09:10.000
And all these young pines, he told the farmer, he says, you ought to thin them out.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.282
You ought to sell them.

09:11.302 --> 09:12.445
Sell off the pulpwood.

09:12.465 --> 09:13.467
He says, they're too thick.

09:14.129 --> 09:16.053
Well, the farmer wouldn't have any part of it.

09:16.113 --> 09:24.030
He didn't agree with Jim until Jim finally reached in his pocket and he pulled out a little gadget there he called an increment borer.

09:24.010 --> 09:27.955
Well, friends, that increment bore, I mean, that's a four-bit word there.

09:27.975 --> 09:34.624
It ain't a thing in the world but a bore, a bracing bit thing that you drill a hole in the tree, in the side of the tree.

09:34.664 --> 09:43.496
It don't hurt it a bit, don't hurt it a bit, but it brings out, it brings out, not sawdust, it brings out, I wish I could show you what the thing is.

09:43.536 --> 09:45.158
It's kind of hard to explain.

09:45.138 --> 09:49.503
But I know what it is, and so Jim brought that thing out, and he bored a hole inside of it there.

09:49.523 --> 09:50.944
It's kind of a drill, is what it is.

09:51.365 --> 09:54.368
He drilled a hole inside a few of these tight-growing pines.

09:55.069 --> 09:56.691
Of course, don't hurt them like I told you.

09:56.971 --> 10:02.497
And they come out with a regular core, a little section of wood from the bark to the heart of the tree.

10:03.498 --> 10:06.381
Now, you could see the growth of the tree.

10:06.401 --> 10:11.567
Well, you could count the rings that mark the year, just like a stump after a tree's cut out.

10:12.256 --> 10:15.340
Well, there it was, plain as the nose on your face.

10:15.360 --> 10:23.873
The trees Jim drilled with this increment bore, they had just about stopped growing from all the competition.

10:23.893 --> 10:25.295
They were too thick, in other words.

10:25.675 --> 10:31.344
Now, that convinced the farmer that he ought to thin them out and let the others grow into saw timber.

10:31.604 --> 10:41.959
Well, to make a long story short, Jim showed the farmer how to mark the trees that ought to be cut and how to advertise his timber for sale.

10:42.698 --> 10:50.327
And that farmer, believe it or not, friends, ended up with twice as much cash than what he had offered before.

10:50.988 --> 10:54.893
And that first offer he had was for all the hardwood timber.

10:55.734 --> 11:07.508
When the logging was all over, he still had hardwood left, a good stand, a fine, thinned-out pine stand, which will really be worth a lot more in a few years.

11:08.247 --> 11:17.768
But what tickled me most was how Jim convinced the woods owner that he needed to do a better job of protecting his woods from fire.

11:18.423 --> 11:23.391
Jim had noticed, just like I did, that a lot of the trees were fire-scarred.

11:23.652 --> 11:26.256
In other words, there'd been fire through there and scarred the trees.

11:26.276 --> 11:27.799
Well, Jim noticed that, and I did, too.

11:28.340 --> 11:29.462
Well, there's no doubt about it.

11:30.123 --> 11:33.969
You just can't have good forest management without good fire protection.

11:34.370 --> 11:35.412
Now, here's the next tune.

11:35.472 --> 11:42.844
It's going to feature Herman on his little steel guitar, and it's called Railroading.

11:45.558 --> 11:52.817
Let's switch it.

12:28.471 --> 12:37.080
Oh!

12:55.977 --> 12:57.239
All right there.

12:57.259 --> 12:57.860
Thank you, Herman.

12:57.900 --> 12:58.481
Thank you a lot.

12:58.501 --> 12:59.863
There it was, friends, railroadin'.

12:59.883 --> 13:02.588
We've run out of time and we've got to go here on the old pine tree.

13:03.048 --> 13:06.133
But before we go, here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you.

13:06.694 --> 13:07.956
See your local forester.

13:08.497 --> 13:15.268
If you've got any woodland problems, his advice is always available and he'll be glad to help you solve them.

13:22.218 --> 13:31.170
Friends, we've really enjoyed to visit with you here under the old pine tree.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.132
We hope you'll come our way again soon.

13:33.533 --> 13:38.439
If you'll listen to the local announcer, he'll let you know the exact date and time that we'll be back.

13:38.459 --> 13:50.875
Don't forget, friends, these programs is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own state forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service with the courtesy of the station that you're now listening to.

13:52.525 --> 14:21.553
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

14:26.630 --> 14:33.298
you
