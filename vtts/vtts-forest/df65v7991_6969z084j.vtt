00:00.000 --> 00:14.375

00:14.375 --> 00:39.535
[Music.]

00:39.535 --> 00:40.997
Well, all right there.

00:41.037 --> 00:41.677
Thank you, boys.

00:41.737 --> 00:42.138
Thank you.

00:42.278 --> 00:42.879
Howdy, friends.

00:42.899 --> 00:43.439
How are y'all?

00:43.459 --> 00:43.820
Yes, sir.

00:43.840 --> 00:44.480
You guessed it.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.724
It's your old woods rider again, Jelly Elliott and the Knotheads.

00:47.744 --> 00:54.151
Sitting here under the old pine tree, we're going to play a few tunes for you, friends, and we got a little chatter.

00:54.171 --> 00:59.937
We want to talk to you about things in general in the woods and the forest and all that sort of stuff.

00:59.957 --> 01:06.825
So just gather yourself up there and pile yourself in a chair and rest for a few minutes while Bob Henderson, our

01:07.413 --> 01:12.542
A champion hold-down fiddle player gets started off here with a little tune called Leather Britches.

01:12.542 --> 02:18.912
[Music.]

02:18.912 --> 02:20.874
Well, thank you, Bob.

02:20.955 --> 02:26.041
I know all you old-timers out there remember that old leather britches, and Bob really done a good job on it.

02:26.281 --> 02:27.382
Thank you a lot there, Bob.

02:27.783 --> 02:36.454
Now, friends, every once in a while, around hunting and fishing time, the woods are awful dry and tender.

02:36.554 --> 02:40.078
It's not always that way, but sometimes it is.

02:40.158 --> 02:43.102
No rain, sometimes for months and weeks.

02:43.122 --> 02:45.004
The woods are awful dry and crisp.

02:45.693 --> 02:49.798
The little sticks and leaves and limbs all on the ground are awful dry.

02:51.119 --> 03:09.940
Then the folks who are responsible for taking care of the forest and woods, the forestry boys, state and federal, well, they get together with the 
fish and game boys that looks after the fish and game, and they have to take actions that some folks resent sometimes.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.983
Now, mind you, I said some folks resent sometimes.

03:13.958 --> 03:30.174
They find that they've got to close down the hunting season temporarily or hold it up for a few days until it comes to rain and wets the woods 
where the fire danger won't be so awful bad until it's over, in other words.

03:30.194 --> 03:34.018
Now, this is not unreasonable when you consider what's at stake.

03:35.059 --> 03:36.701
The timber's got to be considered.

03:37.562 --> 03:42.246
The folks' jobs that work in the woods has got to be considered.

03:42.266 --> 03:42.987
And the land...

03:43.388 --> 03:50.635
In the future, good hunting, wildlife itself, and all that sort of thing.

03:50.676 --> 03:53.378
When you take all this into consideration, it's not so bad.

03:54.279 --> 04:02.528
Closing season sometimes is necessary because the records show that you get more fires when hunting season starts.

04:04.089 --> 04:12.518
You can't close your eyes to the fact that when you get more people out in the woods that there's bound to be more chances of fire.

04:13.240 --> 04:25.319
So if you just stop there a minute and think, sometimes cutting the season a little short or putting it off for a few days until it rains and all, it ain't near as bad as going out there hunting and let it burn over and then there won't be no hunting at all.

04:26.021 --> 04:29.246
Well, if you boys are ready here, I guess we better play another tune here.

04:29.266 --> 04:31.690
I believe Charlie's going to sing this next one for you, friends.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.895
He does a lot of good job on it, and I think you're going to like it.

04:34.915 --> 04:39.863
Charlie says, I Don't Like this Kind of Living.

04:39.883 --> 04:44.341
[Music.]

04:44.341 --> 05:11.164
I just don't like this kind of living. I'm tired of doing all the giving. I give my all and sit and yearn, I get no loving in return, 
and I just don't like this kind of living. Why do we stay together?

05:11.284 --> 05:13.926
We always fuss and fight.

05:14.648 --> 05:43.390
You ain't never known to be wrong And I ain't never been right. Please tell me where you think we're going cause I ain't got no way of knowing. 
When things start running smooth and free, you all ride off and you pick on me, and I just don't like this kind of living.

05:43.927 --> 06:20.883
[Music.]

06:20.883 --> 06:42.975
I just don't like the things you're doing. Your evil heart will be your ruin when things go wrong you go your way. You leave me here to pay and pay and i just don't like this kind of living.

06:44.845 --> 06:49.993
They say this road of love is long, it's rocky and it's rough.

06:50.794 --> 06:56.383
But if this road don't start to get smooth, I've traveled it long enough.

06:56.703 --> 07:06.398
Why don't you act a little older and get the chip off of your shoulder?

07:08.470 --> 07:11.415
I've told you once and now I'll tell you twice.

07:11.795 --> 07:14.159
You better start to treat me nice.

07:14.239 --> 07:18.465
Cause I just don't like this kind of living.

07:21.089 --> 07:23.072
Thank you, Charlie, thank you.

07:23.092 --> 07:26.438
Speaking of I don't just like this kind of living, I know a feller.

07:27.519 --> 07:29.903
I'm just sitting there thinking about a feller I know.

07:29.923 --> 07:33.208
And I bet he don't like the kind of living he's doing right now.

07:33.228 --> 07:36.553
No, sir, friends, cause this feller that I know about, he's in jail right now.

07:37.495 --> 07:38.997
But you know what that rascal did?

07:40.058 --> 07:53.472
He deliberately, deliberately went out during one of the worst fire seasons that we've had in years, and he set at least 10 fires in one of the best 
hunting woods there was anywhere in the country.

07:53.492 --> 07:58.178
Well, so they got him, and I mean they took him to court and threw the book at him.

07:58.778 --> 08:02.883
He had to pay a heavy fine, and he's doing a whole year in jail.

08:03.543 --> 08:04.565
I mean a whole year.

08:04.605 --> 08:06.827
That's 365 days.

08:07.364 --> 08:09.868
Or it's 8,760 hours.

08:10.950 --> 08:11.451
Think of that.

08:11.931 --> 08:16.939
Or it's 535,600 minutes that he's spending.

08:16.959 --> 08:20.204
And I bet you them minutes seems like years to him.

08:20.225 --> 08:21.006
Don't you know they do?

08:22.308 --> 08:26.975
He's doing what they call protective custody.

08:26.995 --> 08:28.738
That's a long time, though, a year.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.301
8,760 hours.

08:30.321 --> 08:33.726
Boy, that's a long time.

08:34.685 --> 08:38.851
But the most interesting thing is why he's in jail in the first place.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.036
Now, you know why he set the woods on fire, friend?

08:42.817 --> 08:43.679
Well, he got mad.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.543
Yeah, he got mad.

08:46.563 --> 08:47.625
You know why he got mad?

08:48.346 --> 08:52.612
Because they went and closed the hunting season temporarily.

08:52.633 --> 09:03.409
Closed the hunting season for a few days until it rained and got the woods damp, which really made the hunting a lot better because you can't go out 
in the woods when the woods is dry and you can't slip up on a...

09:03.912 --> 09:07.238
Crawling and slipping along through the dry leaves, making a lot of racket.

09:07.258 --> 09:08.740
You can't kill nothing to start with.

09:09.481 --> 09:10.964
Well, believe it or not, friends, that's right.

09:12.326 --> 09:20.921
It didn't matter to him that there was enough fires already all over the country without adding to the risk more.

09:21.802 --> 09:23.305
No, it didn't make him any difference.

09:23.656 --> 09:27.841
I mean, you could say that he was very ignorant.

09:27.961 --> 09:30.504
It didn't matter to him what these fires were doing.

09:30.885 --> 09:34.870
Trees burning, burning up the wildlife, burned up homes.

09:35.310 --> 09:37.973
I know of one case where a poor old lady got burned up.

09:38.033 --> 09:46.664
She was out fighting fire trying to save her own home, and her dress got afire, and it burned her to such an extent she died in the hospital the next day.

09:47.285 --> 09:49.547
Now, all these sort of things didn't matter to this fellow.

09:50.288 --> 09:53.292
Now, he got mad just because the hunting season was put off.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.960
And it put him to a little inconvenience.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.685
And he thought they ought to go ahead and open it and let him go on with his hunting.

10:01.586 --> 10:08.293
Well, it was going to open anyway, but it was going to open later when it come a rain, see, and wet the woods and everything.

10:08.313 --> 10:13.919
The hunting would have been better, and there wouldn't have been near so much risk of fire in the woods, burning up the wildlife.

10:14.901 --> 10:20.066
Fire kills more squirrels and game, and all the hunters in the world put together.

10:20.146 --> 10:21.608
Did you ever stop to think of that?

10:22.178 --> 10:26.343
Well, just think what one fire can do going down through, I'd say, over a 300-acre.

10:27.084 --> 10:29.347
There's a lot of 300-acre fires in the woods.

10:29.728 --> 10:32.371
And think how much game that destroys and kills and all.

10:32.411 --> 10:36.556
When you can hunt there the rest of your life, you never would kill it all out.

10:36.576 --> 10:37.658
Well, so that's what happened.

10:37.998 --> 10:40.061
And this guy got mad, but he's paying for it.

10:40.101 --> 10:41.723
Now he won't get to hunt any at all.

10:42.327 --> 10:52.980
So, friends, just remember always that when it's necessary to hold up a hunting season or a fishing season for a few days, that there's a lot more at stake than our own selfish part alone.

10:53.341 --> 10:54.662
So keep that in mind.

10:54.682 --> 10:57.966
Here's another tune, and Herman's going to do this one on his steel guitar.

10:58.026 --> 11:00.409
And Herman wrote this tune himself.

11:00.429 --> 11:02.932
We think it's pretty nice, and maybe you'll like it too.

11:03.012 --> 11:04.654
He calls it the steel boogie.

11:04.715 --> 11:05.095
Herman?

11:05.095 --> 12:48.704
[Music.]

12:48.704 --> 12:49.625
Well, thank you, Herman.

12:49.665 --> 12:50.066
Thank you.

12:50.086 --> 12:50.647
There it is.

12:50.707 --> 12:51.668
Herman's on tune.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.411
He calls it the steel boogie.

12:53.431 --> 12:55.514
We hope that you like it, friends.

12:55.534 --> 12:57.296
Neighbors, we're running out of time here.

12:57.737 --> 12:59.459
Today we've got to go.

12:59.479 --> 13:03.004
But here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you before we go.

13:04.126 --> 13:16.804
When there's been no rain for a long, long spell and they've postponed the hunting season, just keep in mind it's for the trees, land, and jobs, and the wildlife as well.

13:16.970 --> 13:21.879
That's the reason.

13:32.518 --> 13:37.627
Well, friends, we've got to bring this little visit to a close, but we'll be back with you again soon.

13:37.647 --> 13:41.273
You listen to the local announcer and he'll let you know the exact time.

13:41.894 --> 13:54.326
Don't forget, friends, that this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:56.128 --> 14:00.292
Remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

14:00.312 --> 14:34.694
[Music.]
