00:11.911 --> 00:17.218
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:17.238 --> 00:18.519
Hello there, folks.

00:18.860 --> 00:22.084
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:22.485 --> 00:27.591
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:27.611 --> 00:32.718
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:33.118 --> 00:35.421
Today, it's Danny Thomas.

00:37.882 --> 00:42.530
Mr. Thomas, I appreciate your taking time to see me, but why here?

00:43.271 --> 00:46.737
Why this patch of woods alongside a beautiful golf course?

00:46.957 --> 00:49.100
Wouldn't you be more comfortable in the clubhouse?

00:49.721 --> 00:54.750
After all, I just want to get your views on preventing forest fires.

00:54.770 --> 00:55.631
Why meet here?

00:55.771 --> 00:59.658
Well, I'll tell you, Smokey, but let's talk about forest fires first.

01:00.279 --> 01:02.843
Now, they're mighty serious business and no one should joke about them.

01:03.498 --> 01:11.267
As you know, I've done a lot of traveling around the country entertaining, and I've seen many states that'd give anything to have some of their favorite forests green again.

01:12.408 --> 01:14.951
We mustn't take our forests and woodlands for granted, you know.

01:14.971 --> 01:20.097
They mean too much to us with their timber and wildlife for recreation and as a source of water.

01:21.079 --> 01:27.326
We can't afford to be careless with fire in the forest, no matter how much better off we may seem to be at times.

01:27.506 --> 01:32.492
Well, thank you, Mr. Thomas, but you still haven't told me why you picked this meeting place.

01:32.658 --> 01:36.003
Why, you see, Smokey, these woods are a regular old golf ball trap.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.506
I've pulled many of my shots into here time and again.

01:38.526 --> 01:41.851
Why, there must be dozens of good golf balls lying around hidden.

01:41.871 --> 01:45.696
I thought maybe with your woods, Savvy, you might help me look around a bit before it gets dark.

01:46.918 --> 01:49.121
And, Smokey, you can call me Danny.

01:49.141 --> 01:49.882
Sure thing.

01:50.703 --> 01:51.124
Danny.

01:51.985 --> 01:57.012
And while you two are hunting golf balls, the boys and I will cover up for you with a bit of yippy-eyed.

01:58.696 --> 02:04.586
Now, prairie folks assure you there ain't nothing that'll cure you any quicker than the medicine they fix up for themselves.

02:04.606 --> 02:10.917
With their sulfur and molasses, pepper tea and mustard plasters in their camphor bags and flannel rags that line the bunkhouse shelf.

02:10.937 --> 02:15.585
But here's one remedy that they use that never fails to chase the blues.

02:16.386 --> 02:24.400
Just try it for yourself and see the world get brighter.

02:24.937 --> 02:30.404
When you get weary of trouble and care, here's what a cowhand would say.

02:31.125 --> 02:36.633
Cast your eye on the sun and the sky, yippy-eye your troubles away.

02:37.394 --> 02:39.897
When you cut loose, watch your troubles flammoose.

02:40.458 --> 02:43.001
Skies won't be cloudy or gray.

02:43.682 --> 02:49.510
No reason why you should worry or cry, yippy-eye your troubles away.

02:49.912 --> 02:52.657
Scatter your woes with the sunrise.

02:53.219 --> 02:55.443
Everything's rosy and swell.

02:56.285 --> 02:58.790
Just sing a note through that lump in your throat.

02:59.050 --> 03:02.217
Greet the dawn with a cowboy yell.

03:02.678 --> 03:05.423
Here's what to do when you're lonely and blue.

03:05.673 --> 03:34.245
Make it a wonderful day Cast your eye on the sun and the sky If the eye your troubles away Scatter your woes with the sunrise Everything's rosy and swell

03:34.445 --> 03:41.335
Just sing a note through that lump in your throat, greet the dawn with a cowboy yell.

03:41.355 --> 03:47.044
Here's what to do when you're lonely and blue, make it a wonderful day.

03:47.945 --> 03:56.318
Cast your eye on the sun and the sky, yippee-i, your troubles away, yippee-i, your troubles away.

03:59.639 --> 04:02.243
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:02.263 --> 04:04.746
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:05.127 --> 04:10.755
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:10.795 --> 04:16.603
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:17.124 --> 04:28.380
Until we say, hello there again, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember, only you

04:28.782 --> 04:31.586
can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:32.227 --> 04:41.062
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniff in the air.

04:41.643 --> 04:45.749
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:45.789 --> 04:50.757
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:58.448 --> 04:59.712
.

04:59.732 --> 04:59.973
.

05:00.936 --> 05:07.378
