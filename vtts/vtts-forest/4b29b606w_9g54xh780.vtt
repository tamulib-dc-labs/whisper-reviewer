00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
[Silence.]

00:14.000 --> 00:41.000
[Music.]

00:41.341 --> 00:43.306
Oh, now, thank you, boys, thank you.

00:43.326 --> 00:44.429
Howdy, friends, how y'all.

00:44.489 --> 00:45.391
Jesse, you guessed it.

00:45.452 --> 00:48.138
It's your old woods rider again, Jelly Elliot and the Knotheads.

00:48.700 --> 00:57.763
Sitting here under the big old pine tree, and we're going to be playing some tunes for you in just a few minutes, and we want to talk to you about first one thing or another in the woods.

00:58.098 --> 01:03.349
and such as you like, and we want you to relax for a spell there and just take it easy for a few minutes.

01:03.389 --> 01:12.850
We're going to get things started off here with Bob Henderson, our hoedown fiddle player, playing an old standard hoedown, a little thing called Old Joe Clark.

01:12.850 --> 02:20.483
[Music.]

02:20.672 --> 02:22.736
Thank you, Bob.

02:22.776 --> 02:23.457
Thank you, boys.

02:23.497 --> 02:24.899
There it was, old Joe Clark.

02:25.319 --> 02:30.086
You know, friends, I just had a little story here on my mind I wanted to tell you about.

02:30.606 --> 02:35.072
I wanted to tell you about a woods fire, a forest fire that I went on myself.

02:35.172 --> 02:38.497
I was there, and I saw what happened.

02:38.517 --> 02:44.224
And I just wish it was so that all of you could have seen the things that I seen out on this particular fire.

02:44.725 --> 02:46.127
Friends, this fire was raging.

02:46.187 --> 02:48.750
It was the worst fire I've ever seen.

02:49.220 --> 02:54.226
I've heard of worse fires, but this wouldn't beat anything I ever seen.

02:54.246 --> 02:58.190
There was trees there, friends, big grown trees falling in every direction.

02:58.210 --> 02:59.111
The wind was high.

02:59.612 --> 03:06.700
We had three big crews of men and all the help we could get out there trying to slow it down and head it off.

03:06.760 --> 03:10.504
And I'm telling you, it was really panicky around there for a while.

03:10.524 --> 03:15.970
Three of the boys, three of the men, that nearly lost their lives in this very fire.

03:16.355 --> 03:29.878
In one case, there was a tree burned down, a grown tree, big tree, I'd say four foot through, burned down and hit the ground right side of two of these fellows, and they almost lost their lives.

03:29.898 --> 03:32.822
One of the men almost lost his eyesight in this very fire.

03:33.243 --> 03:37.350
All three of them went to the hospital, and I'm telling you, friends,

03:38.512 --> 03:43.037
What I saw there that day was enough to make a believer out of anybody.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.880
There was a deer running ahead of the fire.

03:45.900 --> 03:50.686
Every once in a while you'd see deer just streaking out ahead of that fire, just running for dear life.

03:51.026 --> 03:55.171
The little ones would get scorched in the fire, and you could hear them ablating and running.

03:55.191 --> 04:00.077
You could see the squirrels traveling through the top of the trees trying to get out of the way.

04:00.097 --> 04:06.544
And these fellows had almost lost their lives, friends, was caused from some careless...

04:06.878 --> 04:10.063
fire being set out as to backfire.

04:11.125 --> 04:18.858
Some person got panicky and thought he was doing the right thing, and he set some fire and hemmed these fellows in between the two fires.

04:19.359 --> 04:20.220
And that's what happened.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.486
That's the point that I wanted to bring out.

04:23.506 --> 04:27.773
And that's my little sermon today, if you want to call it that.

04:28.107 --> 04:36.515
I just want to explain and tell you how important it is to know what you're doing before you go setting out fire to try to stop fire.

04:36.795 --> 04:39.998
That can be a very, very serious proposition.

04:40.178 --> 04:41.859
It can cause lots of damage.

04:41.879 --> 04:46.503
And I'm going to tell you about a scene I was on myself.

04:46.604 --> 04:48.005
I was there and seen this happen.

04:48.045 --> 04:49.906
I want to tell you about it in just a few minutes.

04:50.347 --> 04:53.089
But first, I guess we better play a team here.

04:53.109 --> 04:57.253
And Ray Parker is going to step up here to Mike Ackerphone and sing this one for you, friends.

04:57.537 --> 05:04.844
Don't Just Stand There.

05:04.864 --> 05:10.911
When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there.

05:10.931 --> 05:16.556
When you see that moon above, don't just stand there.

05:16.576 --> 05:19.459
You gotta laugh and dance and sing.

05:19.479 --> 05:22.122
You gotta get that gallery.

05:22.482 --> 05:26.987
When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there.

05:36.333 --> 06:01.243
Well then, baby, you're out with the wrong one. When you feel like you're in love, hold her tighter. And the moon and stars above will all shine brighter. 
You gotta laugh and dance and sing. You gotta get that gal a ring. When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there.

06:01.243 --> 06:23.026
[Music.]

06:23.026 --> 06:43.347
When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there. When you see that moon above, don't just stand there. You gotta laugh and dance and sing. You gotta 
get that gal a ring. When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there.

06:49.621 --> 07:16.000
When the moon is shining bright in your Saturday night, if you're not having any fun, well then baby you're out with the wrong one. When you feel like you're in love, hold her tighter, 
and the moon and stars above will all shine brighter, you gotta laugh and dance and sing, you gotta get that gal a ring. When you feel like you're in love, don't just stand there.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.341
Thank you, Ray.

07:21.381 --> 07:21.722
Thank you.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.424
That was mighty nicely done there, buddy.

07:23.884 --> 07:29.551
Friends, you know many people use fire without knowing how, and that's the point I wanted to get over to you.

07:29.571 --> 07:43.008
I know of one case where the state lost some equipment by a man setting out what he thought was a backfire and getting this piece of equipment hemmed in between the two fires, and the men almost lost their lives.

07:43.028 --> 07:49.075
They had to jump off of the plows and the tractors and run for their life and get out of the way and naturally lost the equipment.

07:49.375 --> 07:50.656
Well, now that cost a lot of money.

07:50.696 --> 07:52.438
That piece of equipment cost a lot of money.

07:52.498 --> 07:57.984
That was caused from somebody getting panicky and trying to use fire and didn't know how to use fire.

07:58.004 --> 08:05.771
It's a natural instinct for anybody to protect their home or their land, but there's a right way and then there's lots of wrong ways.

08:06.352 --> 08:12.338
I know of another case, friends, where we was called on a fire, and I went out with the boys to this fire.

08:12.358 --> 08:15.501
Well, when we got out there, the fire was going pretty good.

08:15.818 --> 08:19.242
And it was headed for a man's pasture that he had just seeded down.

08:19.302 --> 08:22.906
He had an improved pasture, and it was headed for his pasture.

08:22.926 --> 08:27.711
Well, right away, the crews got in there to fighting this fire, trying to take care of it and get it headed off.

08:27.731 --> 08:35.480
And this farmer got panicky, and he got out there and was going to backfire to keep it from getting into his pasture and wound up burning up everything.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.322
We couldn't do anything about it.

08:37.342 --> 08:41.607
The boys, it was just too much for him because he'd set out more fire there than we had equipment.

08:41.857 --> 08:44.099
to take care of on this particular fire.

08:44.400 --> 08:49.505
So that's another case where a man got panicky and thought he was doing good when he wasn't.

08:49.525 --> 08:50.807
He burned up the whole place.

08:51.067 --> 08:53.930
Burned up his pasture and all that.

08:53.950 --> 08:54.931
And he done it himself.

08:56.153 --> 08:59.316
Now, friends, you got to be careful with fire.

08:59.737 --> 09:01.999
And you go out there, call yourself backfiring and all.

09:02.039 --> 09:04.942
If you don't know how to backfire, that's a serious proposition.

09:04.962 --> 09:07.465
You can burn up half the country.

09:07.485 --> 09:11.830
And if you go out to help these forestry boys, in a lot of cases I know of

09:12.012 --> 09:14.575
volunteers going out to help these forestry boys.

09:15.015 --> 09:18.900
Well, by all means, don't go out there and go to setting backfires.

09:18.920 --> 09:27.990
If there's any backfiring to be done, you let them do that because they know what they're doing, and they know where to put them and where they'll do best, and they know how to take care of it.

09:29.171 --> 09:31.694
And, of course, they appreciate the help.

09:32.074 --> 09:33.516
They appreciate help any time.

09:33.596 --> 09:37.260
But the best help you can give them is to not let the fires get started.

09:37.409 --> 09:38.870
That's the best tip you can give them.

09:39.171 --> 09:43.195
Friends, you can always get good advice from the farm forester.

09:43.795 --> 09:49.421
Now, you don't have to take my word alone for it, because I've got my friend up here today, Jim Langford.

09:50.362 --> 09:52.705
He's a local forester, and he's right here with me.

09:53.005 --> 09:54.546
Now, ain't I right about that, Jim?

09:55.908 --> 09:57.670
You're right as rain, Jelly.

09:58.410 --> 10:05.037
As foresters, we're anxious and willing to help anyone who's interested in growing more and better timber.

10:05.877 --> 10:10.523
And forest fire prevention definitely is part of our job.

10:11.144 --> 10:17.232
Because, well, you just can't grow good timber where fires run wild.

10:17.973 --> 10:19.976
Fire kills the little trees.

10:20.777 --> 10:23.720
It slows up the growth of those not killed.

10:23.741 --> 10:28.967
And it scars them up so badly, the insects and disease usually take over.

10:29.788 --> 10:33.994
And as you've said, Jelly, if anyone wants help or advice,

10:34.396 --> 10:43.129
as to where and how to locate fire lines, I'd say the fellow to call on is the local or service forester.

10:43.149 --> 10:52.162
Being prepared for that bad fire situation is good insurance, and just like any other insurance, it's good to have it before it's too late.

10:53.164 --> 10:53.805
Thank you, Jim.

10:53.845 --> 10:54.486
Thank you a lot.

10:54.526 --> 10:59.453
Now, there, friends, is some good, solid, sound advice, and I do hope that you'll pay attention to it.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.516
Jim knows what he's talking about.

11:01.636 --> 11:04.200
He's spent a lifetime at this sort of thing, and he knows.

11:05.260 --> 11:13.388
And like he says, when fire goes through this young timber, it usually burns up the biggest part of it and kills it dead.

11:13.528 --> 11:18.993
What it don't kill, it stunts the growth of it so bad that it takes years for it to get over it.

11:19.013 --> 11:23.697
And then it scars it up and leaves it badly burned and insects come in and take over.

11:24.058 --> 11:27.081
You pay attention to what Jim Lankford had to say there, friends.

11:27.101 --> 11:28.622
Well, we're going to do another tune here.

11:29.022 --> 11:29.843
We've got another tune.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.825
This is a steel tune featuring Herman.

11:32.193 --> 11:36.470
Herman on his little steel guitar, doing the steel guitar ramble.

11:36.651 --> 11:51.012
[Music.]

11:55.598 --> 12:04.798
Thank you.

12:24.370 --> 12:34.845
Well, thank you, Herman.

12:34.865 --> 12:35.826
Thank you a lot.

12:35.846 --> 12:38.049
That was, friend, the steel guitar ramble.

12:38.570 --> 12:41.915
Well, friends, we're running out of time, and we've got to shove off here.

12:42.356 --> 12:43.497
But we'll be back with you.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.141
The local announcer will let you know when.

12:46.161 --> 12:49.866
Friends, there's a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you right now.

12:50.086 --> 12:51.188
I want you to listen to it.

12:51.758 --> 12:58.010
Protect your land and your home beforehand, and you won't have sorrows or woes.

12:58.030 --> 13:00.836
It's the very best kind of insurance.

13:00.856 --> 13:12.619
Be prepared, as the saying goes.

13:16.396 --> 13:23.545
Well, friends, we've really enjoyed this little visit with you, and we hope that you have heard something that will interest you and you'll keep it in mind.

13:24.767 --> 13:26.389
We'll be coming your way again soon.

13:26.429 --> 13:27.971
The announcer will let you know when.

13:28.432 --> 13:37.864
And don't forget, neighbors, that this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service

13:38.182 --> 13:42.987
with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:43.007 --> 13:46.932
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

13:48.113 --> 14:20.256
[Music.]

14:20.256 --> 14:30.00
[Silence.]
