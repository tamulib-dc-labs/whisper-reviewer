00:15.269 --> 00:19.015
All right, let's go!

00:19.055 --> 00:19.435
Ho!

00:19.656 --> 00:19.836
Ho!

00:19.856 --> 00:20.216
Ho!

00:20.257 --> 00:20.637
Ho!

00:20.898 --> 00:21.178
Ho!

00:21.218 --> 00:37.783
Ho!

00:40.396 --> 00:41.925
All right, sold out, Doc.

00:41.965 --> 00:43.212
Another soul made happy.

00:43.232 --> 00:43.816
Howdy, friend.

00:43.856 --> 00:44.459
How are y'all?

00:44.801 --> 00:45.968
Hope you're feeling fine.

00:46.431 --> 00:47.014
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.562
Well, you guessed it again.

00:48.643 --> 00:53.708
It's your old woods rider himself, Jelly Elliot and the Knotheads, sitting here under the big old pine tree.

00:54.309 --> 00:56.812
And we've been hoping that you'd come this way again.

00:57.412 --> 00:59.815
And now that you're here, just set a spell and relax.

00:59.935 --> 01:10.487
Pull up a chair there and make yourself comfortable while me and the boys whip up a few of these old hillbilly tunes and dish out a little chatter about things in general out in the woods and forests.

01:10.467 --> 01:16.016
We're going to get things started off here with the first tune that features Bob on his fiddle.

01:16.337 --> 01:17.279
It's an old-timer.

01:17.359 --> 01:21.346
I know all you old-timers out there really enjoy this, so you listen close.

01:21.366 --> 01:25.152
Here's Bob to do this old-timer of the Wednesday night waltz.

01:49.617 --> 02:09.824
Yes, Mr. Raymond.

02:09.944 --> 02:17.734
Wash me around here, Jenny.

02:20.532 --> 02:35.942
Uh huh.

02:43.972 --> 02:47.840
Thank you, boys, and thank you, Bob, a whole lot.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.724
Y'all kind of cut that one short there, didn't you?

02:50.345 --> 02:55.054
That's the Wednesday night waltz, and we do hope that all of you old-timers enjoyed it a whole lot.

02:55.074 --> 02:57.880
Friends, we're going to dedicate this whole program to the women.

02:58.636 --> 03:03.362
All you women out there, sweet things, we're going to dedicate this whole program to you.

03:03.783 --> 03:13.877
Because you know why, friends, one reason why is the women, they play a bigger part in this forest fire prevention business than most folks realize.

03:13.897 --> 03:15.259
Did you ever stop to think of that?

03:15.559 --> 03:17.502
The women really play a big part in it.

03:17.662 --> 03:22.729
In fact, of course, they always speak of the man around the house wearing the pants.

03:22.809 --> 03:24.932
Well, he does wear the pants.

03:24.952 --> 03:27.816
But I'll tell you one thing Mama has a lot to do with.

03:28.117 --> 03:29.238
what's going on.

03:29.258 --> 03:30.539
She sure does.

03:30.559 --> 03:36.865
They realize that they've got a definite responsibility to prevent these forest fires.

03:36.885 --> 03:38.847
Now, a woman knows the value of things.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.208
Did you ever stop to think of that?

03:40.268 --> 03:40.949
I know you have.

03:41.009 --> 03:42.810
You men out there, you won't acknowledge it.

03:42.830 --> 03:44.912
You won't admit it or anything like that.

03:44.952 --> 03:45.533
I won't either.

03:45.553 --> 03:46.294
I'm a married man.

03:46.334 --> 03:47.595
I got a wife and two children.

03:48.756 --> 03:55.062
But, you know, about, I'd say, I'd say three-thirds of the time, she's right.

03:55.082 --> 03:55.542
And, uh,

03:56.011 --> 03:59.075
These women, they realize the value of things.

03:59.095 --> 04:01.878
A forest is more than just a thing of beauty to them.

04:02.519 --> 04:12.470
It's lumber, and it's furniture, and it's pencils and paper for the kids to go to school, and it's kitchen shelves, and it's kitchen tables.

04:13.171 --> 04:16.114
Well, it's a lot of things that they realize that you don't.

04:17.075 --> 04:17.656
Maybe you don't.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.797
You men I'm talking about.

04:18.897 --> 04:20.359
You don't realize it, and they do.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.862
And they know that trees...

04:23.315 --> 04:29.785
like their own children, must be protected and be allowed to grow up strong and healthy and amount to something.

04:30.406 --> 04:33.651
Now, they look to the future more than the men do.

04:33.671 --> 04:37.036
Through their clubs and by themselves, they're doing a wonderful job.

04:37.637 --> 04:43.446
They're behind tree planting, and they're behind these forester boys in preventing fires.

04:43.466 --> 04:47.112
They're behind them 100%.

04:48.593 --> 04:50.155
I'll tell you a story about a fellow.

04:50.416 --> 05:07.139
I wanted to tell you a story about a fellow that was careless with a fire, and he let it get out into some newly planted trees, and it burned it off, and the police got him and got him up there in the court and all, and they didn't know how to find him or just exactly what to do, and his wife stepped up and said, I'll tell you what to do, Judge.

05:07.159 --> 05:11.766
Said, you just find him to replant these trees, replant them.

05:12.303 --> 05:19.374
Well, it was kind of funny that she stepped in and said that, and so the old judge, he kind of snickered under his breath, and he said, well, that's the fine.

05:19.394 --> 05:20.075
So what did she do?

05:20.115 --> 05:22.298
She got out there and helped him replant all these trees.

05:22.819 --> 05:23.480
Ain't that nice?

05:23.540 --> 05:24.802
That is really fine.

05:24.822 --> 05:29.349
Here's the next tune, and I believe Charlie's going to sing this little tune.

05:29.369 --> 05:32.775
We'll dedicate this from the wives to the husbands.

05:32.795 --> 05:34.277
That's how much I love you.

05:35.675 --> 05:59.860
Now if I had a nickel, I know what I would do I'd spend it all for candy and give it all to you I'd spend it all for candy and give it all to you Cause that's how much I love you, baby That's how much I love you

06:02.337 --> 06:09.493
Now if you were a kitten with pretty glossy fur, I'd pick you up and stroke you and listen to you purr.

06:09.714 --> 06:13.181
I'd pick you up and stroke you and listen to you purr.

06:13.402 --> 06:16.549
Cause that's how much I love you, baby.

06:17.035 --> 06:34.217
that's how much i love you

06:41.369 --> 06:44.955
Now if you were a tiger, I'd hang around your den.

06:45.255 --> 06:48.981
I'd pester you, my honey, until you let me in.

06:49.001 --> 06:52.487
I'd pester you, my honey, until you let me in.

06:52.767 --> 06:55.812
Cause that's how much I love you, baby.

06:56.553 --> 06:59.378
That's how much I love you.

07:01.231 --> 07:16.253
Now if you were a horsefly and I an old grey mare I'd stand and let you bite me and never move a hair I'd stand and let you bite me and never move a hair Cause that's how much I love you, baby

07:16.233 --> 07:34.107
that's how much i love you

07:44.330 --> 07:48.033
Now if you want to marry, now let me tell you what.

07:48.053 --> 07:51.817
We'll go and find the parson and let him tie the knot.

07:51.837 --> 07:55.460
We'll go and find the parson and let him tie the knot.

07:55.660 --> 07:59.464
Cause that's how much I love you, baby.

07:59.484 --> 08:04.388
That's how much I love you.

08:04.408 --> 08:05.469
Well, thank you, Charlie.

08:05.569 --> 08:06.911
Thank you a lot.

08:06.931 --> 08:11.755
We dedicate that from all the wives to the husbands.

08:12.967 --> 08:21.200
You know, friends, I know of a case happening about a lady that lived out in the edge of the woods.

08:21.220 --> 08:24.265
The reason I say the edge of the woods, their place joined the woods.

08:25.327 --> 08:32.198
And you know how a woman is about getting out in the yard and raking up all the leaves and the trash and stuff and pile it up and burn it.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.642
Well, that's what she was going to do.

08:34.662 --> 08:35.823
She was cleaning yards.

08:35.843 --> 08:39.970
You know, that's nothing to the ladies to clean yards.

08:40.372 --> 08:43.156
because every so often they'd get out and clean yards.

08:43.176 --> 08:45.380
Well, this particular lady was cleaning yards.

08:46.301 --> 08:53.813
She cleaned up all the trash, the leaves and the rubbish and all that sort of stuff, and she took a lot of pains to burn it in the right place.

08:53.833 --> 08:59.862
And she was sure that she wasn't going to leave the fire unprotected or anything like that, so she stayed with it.

09:00.343 --> 09:06.312
She sat right there with it with the rake in her hand, one of these old-timey rakes, you know, that she raked the yards with.

09:07.355 --> 09:09.677
Well, she was staying there watching her fire burn.

09:09.697 --> 09:15.622
She had it going pretty good, and they had quite a young baby in the house, and it was asleep.

09:16.463 --> 09:19.966
About that time, she heard the baby start crying.

09:19.986 --> 09:21.888
So she called to her husband.

09:21.908 --> 09:27.453
Well, he was sitting around inside the house in the shade, lazy rascal, reading the paper.

09:27.473 --> 09:32.738
And he's sitting around there reading, and she called to him and told him to come and watch the fire.

09:32.758 --> 09:33.659
The baby was crying.

09:33.699 --> 09:35.100
She wanted to go inside the house.

09:35.924 --> 09:37.046
He said, all right, honey.

09:37.266 --> 09:38.708
He hollered back, all right, honey.

09:38.788 --> 09:46.098
Well, she figured he'd come on around there and watch the fire, so she went in to see what was happening to the baby.

09:46.118 --> 09:52.527
And so she looked after him, and she'd come back out, come back out expecting to see her husband around there with the rape.

09:52.547 --> 09:54.069
But lo and behold, he wasn't there.

09:54.570 --> 09:56.873
He was still around there buried up in that newspaper.

09:56.913 --> 09:59.637
He'd found something that was awful interesting to him.

10:00.038 --> 10:01.180
And what did she find?

10:01.240 --> 10:02.281
She found the fire.

10:02.682 --> 10:08.991
The sparks had blown out over the fence there into the grass and weeds and had set the woods on fire.

10:09.011 --> 10:10.674
And it was going.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.376
Well, I mean, business picked up then.

10:13.778 --> 10:17.624
And I mean, business really picked up then.

10:17.664 --> 10:19.667
So she hollered to him to come here quick.

10:20.228 --> 10:24.514
And he threw that newspaper down and he come running quick.

10:24.534 --> 10:29.742
So they called in to the forestry boys and they come out on the job and went to work right away.

10:30.025 --> 10:33.470
And it just so happened that they didn't lose but very little acreage.

10:33.810 --> 10:38.616
But that just shows you how little things like that can happen so sudden-like.

10:38.636 --> 10:41.019
Now, she was only gone for just a minute or two there.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.723
And the fire got out in the woods.

10:43.743 --> 10:47.047
And she was very careful to be sure that they didn't get in the woods.

10:47.328 --> 10:48.770
But still, they did get in the woods.

10:48.790 --> 10:50.392
You just can't help it.

10:50.412 --> 10:53.356
And believe me, friends, that husband really got a tongue lashing.

10:53.416 --> 10:55.058
Now, she really bawled him out.

10:55.098 --> 10:57.461
And as far as I know, he's still in the doghouse.

10:58.523 --> 10:59.644
Here's the next tune.

10:59.945 --> 11:03.315
And I believe this features Herman on his little steel guitar.

11:03.335 --> 11:07.587
He's going to play especially for the wives, my little girl.

11:08.209 --> 11:13.043
.

12:39.490 --> 12:40.471
Well, thank you, Herman.

12:40.491 --> 12:41.132
Thank you, boys.

12:41.533 --> 12:44.216
Ladies, don't forget this program was dedicated to you.

12:44.236 --> 12:45.237
God bless you.

12:45.257 --> 12:46.358
Friends, we've run out of time.

12:46.378 --> 12:46.999
We've got to go.

12:47.019 --> 12:51.625
And before we go, here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.828
The woman, bless them, sure help out.

12:54.669 --> 12:59.254
You can call on them any day to work against man-caused forest fires.

12:59.795 --> 13:01.717
They'll do it the woman's way.

13:02.378 --> 13:06.984
Hey!

13:07.004 --> 13:07.084
Hey!

13:09.865 --> 13:18.858
Well, friends, that brings to a close our little visit with you here under the old pine tree.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.321
We certainly hope that you've enjoyed it.

13:21.422 --> 13:21.962
We have.

13:23.244 --> 13:27.450
And maybe that you'll remember some of the things we've told you.

13:27.470 --> 13:39.147
Don't forget, friends, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station

13:39.346 --> 13:41.089
that you're now listening to.

13:41.109 --> 13:47.682
We'll be back with you soon, listen to the announcer, and he'll let you know when.

13:47.702 --> 14:01.489
Remember friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

14:22.445 --> 14:27.038
Bye.
