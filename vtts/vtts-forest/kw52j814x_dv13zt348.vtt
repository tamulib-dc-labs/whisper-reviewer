00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
[Silence.]

00:19.000 --> 00:32.397
[Music.]

00:32.397 --> 00:33.367
Pioneer of the pines.

00:33.367 --> 00:40.387
[Music.]

00:40.387 --> 00:53.342
Your Texas Forest Service of A&M College presents a dramatization of an episode in the life of Dr. Charles Holmes Herty, recognized as the discoverer of the use of southern pine in the manufacture of newsprint.

00:57.946 --> 01:01.450
We take you now to a place near Lufkin, Texas.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.473
It is the morning of May 27, 1939.

01:04.154 --> 01:26.080
Ladies and gentlemen, we are assembled here at the site of the South's first commercial newsprint mill to witness the unveiling of a bronze plaque honoring Charles Holmes Herty, whose experiments in the use of southern pine have made this mill possible.

01:26.887 --> 01:30.893
Dr. Herty was born in the Piney Woods section of Georgia.

01:31.714 --> 01:38.704
His success in making newsprint from southern pines had created for the South a new industry.

01:39.685 --> 01:42.369
It was on a hot summer day in 1927.

01:43.611 --> 01:53.645
While sitting in his New York office, Dr. Herty conceived the idea of making newsprint from southern pines.

01:53.665 --> 01:55.307
Oh my, it's hot today.

01:56.063 --> 01:58.747
Yes, New York seems to be getting hotter every summer.

01:59.728 --> 02:02.192
You'd better take the rest of the afternoon off, Miss Miller.

02:02.432 --> 02:04.255
There's a telephone, Dr. Herty.

02:04.275 --> 02:04.996
Who will answer it?

02:05.237 --> 02:06.599
There's another mail delivery.

02:06.619 --> 02:07.520
Oh, it's all right.

02:07.620 --> 02:08.541
I'll be here.

02:09.283 --> 02:12.027
I'll sit and read that new bulletin which just came in.

02:12.647 --> 02:15.051
I have an appointment in town this evening anyway.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.833
Ah, I see there's a story in the Bulletin on pine.

02:19.814 --> 02:20.395
Yeah, let's see.

02:21.456 --> 02:27.562
Pine trees are probably too resinous for consideration in the manufacture of white paper.

02:28.543 --> 02:29.825
Hmm.

02:29.845 --> 02:34.650
Oh, Miss Miller, before you go, would you get me my file on resin and turpentine?

02:35.290 --> 02:36.452
It's in the old files.

02:38.013 --> 02:43.519
Yeah, whoever wrote this article hasn't heard that healthy pine trees have very little resin and turpentine.

02:44.984 --> 03:11.667
I think you could carry on for a few days.

03:11.798 --> 03:14.607
Yes, and you'd better take a rest while you're there, too.

03:14.788 --> 03:17.998
Well, now, I may be 60, but I'm not going up.

03:18.038 --> 03:19.162
You'd better be on your way.

03:19.423 --> 03:21.630
I'll probably be out of the office for a few days.

03:22.272 --> 03:24.880
I'll leave an address where you can reach me in Georgia.

03:34.867 --> 03:35.768
afternoon, Judge.

03:35.788 --> 03:38.252
I just thought I'd drop in and see how you are.

03:38.312 --> 03:40.074
Doc, where did you come from?

03:40.274 --> 03:41.376
It's good to see you.

03:41.636 --> 03:44.721
I haven't seen you since that forest conservation meeting.

03:44.741 --> 03:45.882
Sit down, Doc.

03:45.902 --> 03:48.045
It's so internally stuffy in New York.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.490
I thought this would be a good time to get back to the Pliny Woods.

03:52.151 --> 03:54.073
And then, too, I... Yes, I knew it.

03:54.113 --> 03:56.977
You didn't come down just for a vacation.

03:56.997 --> 03:57.819
What's on your mind?

03:57.939 --> 04:02.004
Well, I was reading something the other day, and it started me thinking.

04:02.144 --> 04:02.545
I...

04:02.693 --> 04:05.957
Oh, by the way, how are the pine trees growing out on your farm?

04:06.197 --> 04:08.480
I have a stand which needs thinning.

04:08.500 --> 04:13.826
It costs money to thin wood, though, and the timber you cut out is too small for saw logs.

04:13.846 --> 04:16.008
Yes, that's just the problem.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.392
What can you do with trees too small for saw logs?

04:19.412 --> 04:21.194
They aren't much use down here.

04:21.254 --> 04:26.220
Of course, up north in the spruce country, they make newsprint from the small trees.

04:26.740 --> 04:30.404
But newsprint is white, and these pines have yellow wood.

04:30.545 --> 04:32.287
Yes, that's just what I've been thinking about.

04:32.867 --> 04:38.194
I'm not so sure that our so-called yellow pine couldn't be used in the manufacture of newsprint.

04:39.035 --> 04:40.336
How about thinning your woods?

04:40.677 --> 04:43.600
Keep the sawdust from each tree separate and send it to me, hmm?

04:43.620 --> 04:45.763
That sounds a bit fantastic, Doc.

04:46.544 --> 04:48.546
I suppose you're starting on a new experiment.

04:49.606 --> 04:51.730
That's a small wood lot that I have.

04:51.770 --> 04:53.433
Guess it won't break me to have it thin.

04:54.135 --> 04:55.838
I'll sell it for firewood.

04:55.878 --> 05:02.971
It'll help me in my work, and if I'm successful, you won't have to sell your small trees for firewood.

05:02.991 --> 05:04.955
I'll be looking for the samples.

05:04.975 --> 05:07.039
I think I'll drive out to the Piney Woods.

05:07.079 --> 05:08.121
Care to come along?

05:15.340 --> 05:20.607
Gentlemen, I ask only a chance to test the southern pine in your paper-making machinery.

05:21.288 --> 05:25.654
No, everybody knows that yellow pine won't bleach white enough for newsprint.

05:28.798 --> 05:31.763
There's no yellow hardwood in young, healthy trees.

05:32.183 --> 05:33.585
Their wood is white.

05:33.605 --> 05:36.269
Maybe not as white as spruce, but white enough and cheaper.

05:36.549 --> 05:39.373
Trees with all that gum are not fit for paper-making.

05:42.003 --> 05:50.314
It takes 50 to 60 years for a Canadian spruce to grow to a size that a southern pine reaches in from 12 to 15 years.

05:51.035 --> 05:55.581
At the rate we're gobbling up newsprint, the available spruce will soon be cleaned off.

05:55.601 --> 06:00.507
Not to speak of the $170 million it's costing annually to import this paper.

06:00.527 --> 06:04.312
Why should we test the pine that grows so fast in the southern swamps?

06:04.853 --> 06:07.176
Suppose it works as you claim it will.

06:07.196 --> 06:10.660
Where would that put us with our money invested in spruce holdings?

06:13.610 --> 06:15.774
You've heard my story, Mr. Spence.

06:16.895 --> 06:19.239
What say you for the Castanio Mills, hmm?

06:19.800 --> 06:20.481
All right.

06:20.501 --> 06:20.842
All right.

06:21.183 --> 06:21.764
Bring a sample.

06:28.034 --> 06:32.361
So, Dr. Garvin, my first tiny experiment at the Castanio Mills was a success.

06:33.223 --> 06:37.710
Now I'm asking your chemical foundation for money for a laboratory.

06:38.062 --> 06:43.708
If you can bleach that southern pine, you've discovered something that'll revolutionize the paper industry, Herty.

06:44.189 --> 06:51.877
You can count on the Chemical Foundation for $50,000 for a laboratory if someone else will furnish that $20,000 annually for its operation.

06:52.919 --> 06:55.742
I'm wondering if you might not get the state of Georgia to help you.

06:56.463 --> 07:01.268
I think I'll drop down to Atlanta and have a talk with the boys in the legislature.

07:09.618 --> 07:10.459
Hello, Doc.

07:10.619 --> 07:12.342
I see you're still around.

07:12.362 --> 07:15.486
Haven't got the money yet for that paper-making laboratory?

07:15.506 --> 07:20.352
No, but I don't think I'll have to wait long, what with the depression hitting everyone.

07:20.372 --> 07:26.140
You know, even some of you legislators have wood lots that will, well, could be making you money.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.403
Cutting firewood isn't very profitable.

07:29.412 --> 07:32.036
I've succeeded in bleaching the southern pine.

07:32.456 --> 07:34.920
It'll be necessary to make some further tests.

07:35.380 --> 07:38.104
I'll have a talk with some of the men who have woodlots.

07:38.665 --> 07:41.769
You know, the people of this state could use some extra money.

07:41.789 --> 07:45.995
They can't get much more than survival on what they're going to get for cotton.

07:46.015 --> 07:48.940
You know, you've almost become a lobbyist on the subject.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.403
I'll appreciate any help you can give me.

07:51.974 --> 07:55.537
It would mean more money for the people of the South and cheaper paper for everyone.

07:56.278 --> 08:06.366
Now, it would help a lot if you could bring the matter up before the legislature ends.

08:06.566 --> 08:10.550
Thank you, gentlemen.

08:10.570 --> 08:12.692
I am sure you won't be sorry.

08:12.712 --> 08:14.453
Better get started right away, Doc.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.074
I could use some extra money.

08:16.915 --> 08:19.878
I have a right nice stand of pine waiting for you.

08:19.898 --> 08:21.559
And a lot of new ones coming off.

08:23.210 --> 08:24.932
Here's another offer to help, Doc.

08:25.012 --> 08:27.596
You seem to sold everyone on making paper out of pine.

08:28.117 --> 08:34.345
This one's from a Canadian paper mill, the Beaver Wood Fiber Company, a third bowl candidate, says.

08:35.046 --> 08:37.509
Better write them that we'll be up the last of October.

08:38.270 --> 08:41.715
Yes, it looks as though we'll have our first big run yet in 1933.

08:41.795 --> 08:46.481
How much pulp will it take, Doc?

08:46.801 --> 08:51.748
Oh, I'd say not less than 25 tons of chemical and mechanical pulp together.

08:52.066 --> 08:55.510
It'll have to be mixed with three times that much water.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.873
You mean we'll have to haul the water up to Canada too?

08:57.993 --> 09:02.819
Yes, the pulp will have to be kept under refrigeration to prevent spoiling.

09:03.059 --> 09:04.601
What do we do with the paper from this run?

09:04.881 --> 09:12.870
I have promised the daily newspapers of Georgia the first paper for use in special editions on all Georgia pine newsprint.

09:12.890 --> 09:14.412
We'd better get our men together.

09:14.510 --> 09:20.098
We'll have to divide into two shifts and work day and night for the next few weeks to get that pulpwood ready.

09:20.118 --> 09:23.083
Suppose you see if you can get some extra help, hmm?

09:23.103 --> 09:24.105
I'll go talk with the men.

09:30.514 --> 09:35.942
I'll just make out this bill of Layton, and we'll be ready to roll as soon as the Fruit and Vegetable Express arrives.

09:36.804 --> 09:39.648
What do you want me to call that, what you put in those cars?

09:39.989 --> 09:40.990
Pulp of Wood.

09:41.847 --> 09:44.531
Oh, P-U-L-P of wood, all right.

09:44.732 --> 09:47.016
I understand you have 75 tons of water in it.

09:47.456 --> 09:48.799
Thought you might want to call it water.

09:49.780 --> 09:50.461
Here you are, Doc.

09:50.582 --> 09:51.022
Good luck.

09:51.183 --> 09:52.124
Here comes your train.

10:00.338 --> 10:00.698
Come in.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.665
Oh, I didn't know you were dizzy.

10:04.966 --> 10:05.687
That's all right.

10:05.907 --> 10:08.690
Henry here just stopped in to tell me that the Popwood came in.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.952
Do you know Mr. Zeman, our superintendent?

10:11.152 --> 10:12.954
Mr. Zeman, how do you do?

10:12.974 --> 10:17.379
Sorry to have to tell you this, but we've just had a rush order for paper from one of our best customers.

10:17.879 --> 10:20.442
It looks as though we'll have to postpone the run for a few days.

10:21.102 --> 10:23.064
Let's see, this is Saturday.

10:23.084 --> 10:25.146
We ought to be finished by Tuesday.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.469
Suppose we set November 1st for the test run.

10:27.969 --> 10:30.332
You'll have time for any preliminary tests that you want to make.

10:30.612 --> 10:31.493
Oh, that'll be fine.

10:32.134 --> 10:33.555
I'll be ready when you are.

10:42.158 --> 10:44.041
Jim, is the stock chest full of pulp?

10:44.161 --> 10:45.523
Yes, it's filled to the brim.

10:45.823 --> 10:46.605
How about you, man?

10:46.625 --> 10:49.749
Has all the spruce pulp been washed out of that equipment?

10:49.769 --> 10:50.170
Yes, so ready.

10:50.210 --> 10:51.292
Bring on the plan.

10:51.312 --> 10:53.174
Are you ready, Dr. Hardy and Mr. Ball?

10:53.595 --> 10:58.022
Dr. Hardy and I will stand up on the balcony where we can watch the paper machine.

10:58.042 --> 11:01.367
You know, Doctor, I think I'm as excited about this test run as you.

11:01.887 --> 11:05.994
It's hard to believe that at last a test run is being made under commercial conditions.

11:06.955 --> 11:11.642
I guess you know how much the success of this run will mean to the people of the South.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.464
Say, say, isn't that wire beginning to look milky?

11:15.664 --> 11:16.986
Yes, and it's getting thicker.

11:17.286 --> 11:19.790
The vacuum gauge on the suction couch shows 13.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.174
At 15, the sheet will have the right thickness and ready to go.

11:23.254 --> 11:24.836
Now the gauge is beginning to fall.

11:25.237 --> 11:27.359
It looks as though the superintendent has stopped the machine.

11:27.820 --> 11:31.725
He told me he was not going to let the experiment begin until he was sure everything was ready.

11:31.745 --> 11:33.968
Maybe we ought to step down and see what the trouble is.

11:36.158 --> 11:38.441
Yes, that was a long 15-minute wait.

11:39.502 --> 11:41.064
Say, the wire's getting milky again.

11:41.084 --> 11:42.065
The sheet's getting thicker.

11:42.105 --> 11:43.767
Looks as though it'll stick this time.

11:44.147 --> 11:45.529
That goes into the second press.

11:45.589 --> 11:46.089
It's holding.

11:46.430 --> 11:47.771
See it go through those press rolls?

11:47.952 --> 11:49.814
It's on the way back to the stock chest.

11:50.394 --> 11:55.720
Now comes the real test to see if it has sufficient strength to stand the tension as it passes to the drying rolls.

11:55.741 --> 11:58.063
Let's move down to the rolls where we can watch for the paper.

11:59.265 --> 12:00.186
There comes the paper.

12:00.346 --> 12:01.407
It's going on the reel.

12:03.260 --> 12:06.425
Here it is, pure white and smooth surface.

12:06.445 --> 12:07.767
We're going to lick it, Doctor.

12:08.848 --> 12:16.099
And so we have the story of Dr. Herty's success in opening a new field in the newsprint industry.

12:16.840 --> 12:24.771
Today, May 27, 1939, we're dedicating this plaque.

12:24.791 --> 12:32.743
In reality, we're dedicating the beginning of a new industry to the memory of Dr. Charles Herty.

12:33.078 --> 12:40.190
The pioneer of the pines.

12:42.053 --> 12:46.941
You have been listening to a dramatization of an episode in the life of Dr. Charles Holmes Hurtie.

12:47.582 --> 12:55.795
Dr. Hurtie did not live to see the newsprint industry flourish in the South that he loved, but his discoveries have since been put to good use.

12:55.859 --> 12:59.071
Dr. Hurtie's successful newsprint run was made in 1933.

12:59.191 --> 13:05.835
In 1935, a mill making brown craft paper was started in Savannah, Georgia.

13:06.305 --> 13:09.250
Within two years, a dozen mills were being built in the South.

13:09.871 --> 13:16.381
It was in December 1938 that the necessary funds were raised for the first newsprint mill making white paper to be built.

13:16.962 --> 13:28.279
Lufkin, Texas was selected for the new industry's first unit because that area provided an abundance of timber, an adequate water supply, and a cheap fuel source of natural gas.

13:28.259 --> 13:37.091
The Lufkin Mill was dedicated on May 27, 1939, and made the first run of Southern Pine newsprint on January 17, 1940.

13:37.211 --> 13:51.651
A large pulp mill located near Houston, which had been operating since 1937, added a new unit soon after this, and began production of a special machine-coated book paper and other high-grade paper stock from Texas timber.

13:51.631 --> 13:55.937
These two mills are helping supply the paper needs of the Southwest.

13:56.417 --> 14:00.042
Together they represent an investment of more than $15 million.

14:00.583 --> 14:06.350
These two mills produce more than $14 million worth of pulp and paper products each year from Texas timber.

14:07.031 --> 14:13.960
A timber market is provided for timberland owners who wish to improve their woodlands by thinning out the poor, crooked and diseased trees.

14:14.400 --> 14:20.288
Thousands of men are employed in the mills and in the woods receiving millions of dollars in wages each year.

14:22.748 --> 14:26.422
A constant supply of timber can build a greater Texas.

14:28.490 --> 14:32.927
This transcription was presented by the Texas Forest Service of A&M College.
