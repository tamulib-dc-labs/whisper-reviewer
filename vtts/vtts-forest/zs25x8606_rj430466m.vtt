00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
[Silence]

00:12.514 --> 00:19.000
[Music.]

00:19.000 --> 00:24.365
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

00:24.386 --> 00:26.007
That's why they called him Smokey.

00:26.047 --> 00:27.749
That was how he got his name.

00:28.310 --> 00:29.311
Hi there, friends.

00:29.331 --> 00:32.034
I'm Billy Johnson, your singing woodman.

00:32.054 --> 00:34.536
Glad you could come this way up the trail.

00:34.556 --> 00:38.721
How about having a seat beside me here on this log under the old pine tree?

00:39.982 --> 00:41.884
Mighty pretty out here in the forest, isn't it?

00:42.927 --> 00:46.912
That's because we've kept fires from running wild through here.

00:46.932 --> 00:51.417
You know, we thought you might enjoy taking time out for a few moments of song and storytelling.

00:52.398 --> 00:58.104
Just across the trail there are those masters of song about America's great outdoors, the Sons of the Pioneers.

00:58.945 --> 01:01.148
Looks like the boys are all ready.

01:01.168 --> 01:02.589
What are you fellas going to do, Lloyd?

01:02.870 --> 01:06.774
We're going to sing about an old-timer that we'd do well to copy today.

01:07.495 --> 01:09.357
He loved the outdoors just as we do.

01:10.079 --> 01:17.169
He was a good woodsman, among other things, and wherever he traveled, he left his mark as a good woodsman.

01:17.189 --> 01:20.534
A clean camp, a dead fire.

01:20.554 --> 01:21.936
He was an old pioneer.

01:21.936 --> 01:33.131
[Music.]

01:33.131 --> 01:36.576
At a low where buffalo were grazing,

01:38.024 --> 01:41.890
Ranges getting smaller every day.

01:43.272 --> 01:46.897
Cities roar where 44s were blazing.

01:48.460 --> 01:52.446
Trails new have taken you away.

01:54.969 --> 02:04.183
Old pioneer, trailblazing buckaroos.

02:05.041 --> 02:10.508
Where are you riding?

02:10.528 --> 02:16.536
Where have you gone?

02:16.596 --> 02:31.656
O pioneer, Sky trails have taken you Somewhere out yonder

02:31.872 --> 02:57.728
Galloping on. Shining out yonder in the heavens blue, I see a distant star. Sometimes I wonder if it isn't you Beckoning me from afar.

02:58.720 --> 03:09.295
Old pioneer, trailblazing buckaroo,

03:09.315 --> 03:14.662
Where are you riding?

03:14.682 --> 03:18.568
Where have you gone?

03:18.608 --> 03:23.074
Where have you gone?

03:28.775 --> 03:30.197
The Old Pioneer.

03:31.560 --> 03:35.246
Back in his day, the forest and grassland were apparently unlimited.

03:36.528 --> 03:44.361
The old pioneer was always conscious of these natural resources, and usually he was mighty careful with fire.

03:44.381 --> 03:47.506
He knew intimately the danger of letting fire get loose.

03:48.407 --> 03:54.377
He carefully watched over every fire he built, and he put his fires completely out when he was through with them.

03:55.387 --> 04:00.913
Now today, we don't have the limitless areas of forest and grasslands.

04:00.933 --> 04:05.477
That's all the more reason why we should be more careful than ever with our fires.

04:06.618 --> 04:08.820
I'm thinking especially about trash fires.

04:09.801 --> 04:17.890
You know those fires we build around the house to get rid of papers and cardboard boxes, leaves, containers of all kinds, and other trash.

04:19.091 --> 04:25.377
You'd be surprised to know how many grass and woods fires get started because someone is careless in burning trash.

04:27.027 --> 04:32.756
I'd suggest, if you have to burn trash at all, that you do it in a safe container of some sort.

04:32.776 --> 04:36.642
And, of course, it's always a good idea to check the local fire regulations.

04:37.723 --> 04:43.692
And if you do that, you're likely to save yourself some real grief and argument.

04:43.712 --> 04:51.404
Talking about argument, I'm reminded how old-timers used to debate the relative merits of their hound dogs.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.866
Do you remember Old Blue?

04:54.668 --> 05:00.385
I've raised a dog and his name was Blue, and I bet you five dollars he's a good one, too.

05:00.927 --> 05:02.853
Go on, Blue, I'm coming, too.

05:03.435 --> 05:06.163
Go on, Blue, I'm coming, too.

05:06.751 --> 05:09.294
Shouldered my axe and a-tooted my horn.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.618
Going to get me a possum in the new ground corn.

05:12.638 --> 05:16.482
Go on, Blue, I'm coming too.

05:16.502 --> 05:18.785
Old blue tree then I went to see.

05:18.805 --> 05:21.688
There sat the possum in the simmon tree.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.873
Go on, Blue, I'm coming too.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.356
Possum clumped down on the swinging limb.

05:28.836 --> 05:29.978
Blue barked the possum.

05:30.018 --> 05:31.299
Possum growled at him.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.783
Go on, Blue, you good dog, you.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.786
He grinned at me, I looked at him.

05:38.427 --> 05:40.732
I shook him blue, tucked him in.

05:41.192 --> 05:43.276
Go on, Blue, you good dog, you.

05:44.579 --> 05:50.450
I baked that possum good and brown, and I laid them sweet potatoes round and round.

05:50.791 --> 05:54.257
Come on, Blue, you can have some, too.

05:54.608 --> 05:57.252
Blue, what makes your eyes so red?

05:57.572 --> 06:00.176
I run them possum till I'm almost dead.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.421
Go on, Blue, I'm coming too.

06:03.441 --> 06:08.768
Go on, Blue, I'm coming too.

06:08.789 --> 06:10.411
Old Blue was a good dog, all right.

06:11.793 --> 06:13.355
But to get back to trash fires.

06:13.375 --> 06:18.743
Seriously, friends, I know of one case where a homeowner left a little trash fire unattended.

06:19.344 --> 06:23.670
He heard his phone ring or something, and the wind scattered the fire around.

06:24.494 --> 06:29.040
In a matter of hours, that wildfire did unbelievable damage.

06:29.060 --> 06:31.864
It burned more than 100 acres of fine woodland.

06:32.826 --> 06:38.854
The cost of controlling the fire and the damage to the trees and ground cover ran into thousands of dollars.

06:40.136 --> 06:43.280
I don't know how many young quail and small animals were destroyed.

06:43.661 --> 06:44.682
It was a very hot fire.

06:46.224 --> 06:50.350
I'm sure we can all learn a lesson from the unfortunate experience of that homeowner.

06:51.697 --> 06:52.939
But how about a little music?

06:52.959 --> 06:56.304
The Sons of the Pioneers do an instrumental number that's a favorite of mine.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.668
Go ahead and shine, boys.

07:00.631 --> 08:41.784
[Music.]

08:41.784 --> 08:42.771
Shine.

08:42.791 --> 08:48.137
I know that a lot of folks like to shine things up around the house in the spring and in the fall.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.872
That's when I make a raid on all the accumulated trash.

08:52.934 --> 08:56.599
But what we've got to remember, though, is that fire is bad business.

08:57.881 --> 09:02.247
It's bad business, that is, when you stop being its master.

09:02.267 --> 09:06.373
There's an old saying that goes like this as I remember it.

09:06.393 --> 09:08.756
Fire under control is a good servant.

09:09.998 --> 09:12.621
Fire out of control is a bad master.

09:13.923 --> 09:15.646
That goes for trash fires especially.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.348
Don't you think so, Lloyd?

09:17.564 --> 09:23.294
Well, Billy, on this subject of trash fires, we have got a real expert in the sons of the pioneers.

09:23.314 --> 09:24.917
He's Shug Fisher, our bass player.

09:24.937 --> 09:25.959
So go ahead, Shug.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.542
Let's have some words of wisdom.

09:27.822 --> 09:28.744
Thank you, Lloyd.

09:28.764 --> 09:29.405
That's all right.

09:29.425 --> 09:32.350
You folks have got to be careful of burning trash.

09:32.617 --> 09:38.543
In fact, you've got to be careful with any fire outdoors.

09:38.583 --> 09:43.487
They ought to use proper... That's receptacles.

09:43.507 --> 09:45.769
Yeah, receptacles, whatever you can.

09:45.970 --> 09:48.692
Oh, now, that was real fine, Shug, real, real good.

09:48.732 --> 09:54.758
Now, what Shug's been telling us, folks, is that we've really got to be careful burning trash or anything outdoors.

09:55.258 --> 09:59.002
Shug is a 100% Smokey Bear supporter.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.544
Oh, Shug, Shug, don't look so downhearted.

10:01.624 --> 10:02.505
You made your point.

10:02.485 --> 10:04.167
Yeah, but I was... All right.

10:04.188 --> 10:07.853
Well, let the people in on what a wonderful, tough guy you really are.

10:07.913 --> 10:08.554
It's true, folks.

10:08.754 --> 10:11.078
You ain't heard nothing till you hear this boy roar.

10:11.779 --> 10:20.231
I'm tough as a boot and a wild galoot and a son of a lone prairie.

10:20.251 --> 10:23.616
He's tough as a boot and a son of a lone prairie.

10:23.933 --> 10:27.282
I'd drink raw liquor of my trigger, hence quicker than a human eye can see.

10:27.302 --> 10:29.629
You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar.

10:29.769 --> 10:31.354
You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar.

10:31.414 --> 10:32.998
You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar.

10:35.577 --> 10:39.206
Once Jesse James took careful aim with 60 rounds of lead.

10:39.226 --> 10:42.012
Once Jesse James took 60 rounds of lead.

10:43.055 --> 10:46.382
On my chest they cracked, they all bounced back and killed poor Jesse James.

10:46.483 --> 10:51.154
You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar.

10:51.174 --> 10:54.261
You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar.

10:54.241 --> 10:58.106
When my teeth I gnash like a lightning flash, the sparks fly everywhere.

10:58.126 --> 11:02.052
Like a lightning flash, the sparks fly everywhere.

11:02.072 --> 11:05.537
I can roar so loud that a thunder cloud will burst in trembling air.

11:05.557 --> 11:12.066
You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar.

11:12.206 --> 11:17.273
When they made this land, they needed a plan for the toughest man to be.

11:17.333 --> 11:20.738
They needed a plan for the toughest man to be. So the rest of them came, and they built the frame, and the assembled. 
You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar. You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar. 

11:21.140 --> 11:36.553
Now taking this time to explain this rhyme in a manner unprophane.

11:36.573 --> 11:40.060
He's taking his time in a manner unprophane.

11:40.293 --> 11:42.375
I'm a warning you, Skar's a black guy.

11:42.415 --> 11:43.996
So smile when you say my name.

11:44.016 --> 11:47.619
You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar.

11:47.639 --> 11:52.464
You ain't heard nothing until you hear him roar.

11:54.085 --> 11:57.268
Oh, I ain't really tough.

11:58.109 --> 12:00.691
But we should all do like Smokey says.

12:02.112 --> 12:08.798
What Shug's trying to say is Smokey Bear wants all of us, everyone, to help him prevent careless fires.

12:09.233 --> 12:10.715
That's just what I said.

12:11.035 --> 12:12.277
You sure did.

12:13.038 --> 12:13.879
He sure did.

12:15.081 --> 12:17.164
Well, look who's coming up the trail now.

12:17.184 --> 12:21.509
Big as life with his ranger's hat and shovel and all togged out in dungarees.

12:22.210 --> 12:25.034
He's the friend of all who love the outdoors.

12:25.054 --> 12:29.580
He's the popular candidate, the people's choice for support this year and every year.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.925
He's Smokey Bear with a special message for us.

12:33.546 --> 12:35.308
Hello there, folks.

12:35.508 --> 12:41.054
Do you want to help me score a real victory in this campaign against forest fires?

12:41.074 --> 12:43.736
Well, be extra careful burning trash.

12:44.117 --> 12:48.521
That is, if your local laws permit such burning in the first place.

12:48.541 --> 12:53.766
If they do, and you have to burn trash, keep your fire small.

12:53.786 --> 12:56.369
Never go off and leave it unattended.

12:56.389 --> 12:58.591
Have tools and water handy.

12:58.972 --> 13:05.278
If you'll do these things, I promise you we'll have less woods and forest fires starting up.

13:05.444 --> 13:06.745
From trash fires.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.349
Well, I'll be seeing you.

13:10.369 --> 13:12.031
And there he goes down the trail.

13:12.692 --> 13:13.693
Thank you, Smokey.

13:15.254 --> 13:18.538
Well, I suppose it's time for you to head back down the trail, too.

13:19.379 --> 13:22.181
Thanks a lot for joining us under the old pine tree.

13:23.203 --> 13:32.312
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the United States Forest Service, and this station you're listening to that make these little outdoor get-togethers possible.

13:33.254 --> 13:44.656
Until we say hi to each other again, this is Billy Johnson, your singing woodsman, and those masters of outdoor songs, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to please keep in mind what Smokey Bear says.

13:45.237 --> 13:51.048
Remember, only we, you and I, can prevent forest and woods fires.

13:51.068 --> 13:55.937
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear

13:56.187 --> 14:09.488
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air He can find the fire before it starts to flame That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name

14:09.687 --> 14:13.834
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

14:14.395 --> 14:18.341
Prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

14:19.142 --> 14:23.049
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

14:23.409 --> 14:28.017
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

14:28.017 --> 14:46.128
[Music.]

14:46.128 --> 14:55.000
[Silence.]
