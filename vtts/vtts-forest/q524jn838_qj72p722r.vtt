00:03.524 --> 00:05.668
This is Smokey the forest...

00:05.668 --> 00:13.384
[Silence.]

00:13.384 --> 00:17.533
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear.

00:17.733 --> 00:19.736
Hello there, folks.

00:19.756 --> 00:23.120
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:23.821 --> 00:28.928
Those singing friends of mine, the Sons of the Pioneers, have a song for you.

00:29.469 --> 00:34.235
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:34.616 --> 00:36.739
Today, it's Hugh O'Brien.

00:36.759 --> 00:39.943
Hugh's just finished another scene as Wyatt Earp.

00:39.923 --> 00:44.670
Here he comes, tall, strong, and gosh, you look serious.

00:45.231 --> 00:49.278
Hey, Mr. O'Brien, you can take your hands away from those guns now.

00:49.578 --> 00:51.321
It's me, Smokey.

00:51.341 --> 00:54.045
All right, Smokey, relax.

00:54.065 --> 00:59.995
I was just thinking about that report you gave me to read on fires that are started in our forests.

01:00.015 --> 01:04.682
It makes a fellow mad to know that people will deliberately set fire to the forest or range.

01:05.557 --> 01:13.467
Every year, there are around 30,000 of these fires set maliciously or because the guilty ones don't realize the harm they're doing.

01:13.487 --> 01:18.273
The senseless waste of our natural resources must be stopped, and they can be stopped.

01:18.293 --> 01:26.483
If the people and communities where this is going on will just speak up against it, and if our law enforcement officers will follow through to the full extent of the law.

01:27.043 --> 01:30.147
It's good to have you on our side, Mr. O'Brien.

01:30.683 --> 01:34.227
These fellows here, the Sons of the Pioneers, feel the same.

01:34.768 --> 01:37.671
They're going to sing about an old-time bandit.

01:42.237 --> 01:57.214
Long, long ago in old Wyoming lived a maid Fair as the sweetest flower blooming in the shade. She loved a bandit bold who roamed the prairie o'er, And every night she'd listen for his call.

01:57.481 --> 02:26.155
Then far to the west his voice came ringing Riding the wild horse he came singing, Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay. Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay He brings a token of his love. Swift as the wind he goes, High in the hills he knows she's waiting, Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay. Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay.

02:27.130 --> 02:30.621
One day he rode away but never to return.

02:31.243 --> 02:34.513
Danger was waitin' now, his love must ever yearn.

02:35.135 --> 02:38.866
Long days and lonely nights, she waited all in vain.

02:38.886 --> 02:41.494
Till winter passed and summer came again.

02:42.689 --> 03:08.190
Till every night when the moon came shining For his song her heart was pining, Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay. Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay, He brings a token of his love. Swift as the wind he goes, he goes high in the hills He knows she's waiting, Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay. Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay.

03:09.082 --> 03:27.917
One night an angel brought a message from her love. Told her he waited in the starlit sky above. Softly she closed her eyes and bade the angel go, And then the whole world echoed to his song.

03:28.252 --> 03:57.921
For straight down a moonbeam he came ridin' Out of the sky on a winged horse glidin' Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay. Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay, He brings a token of his love. Swift as the wind he goes, High in the hills he knows she's waitin' For his Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay. Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay. Healy-ole-yip-i-ole-yay.

03:59.200 --> 04:06.996
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:07.357 --> 04:09.641
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:09.942 --> 04:15.513
You know, it's your own state forestry department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:15.553 --> 04:21.225
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:21.543 --> 04:27.063
until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star.

04:27.083 --> 04:33.325
This is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember.

04:33.794 --> 04:38.198
Only you can prevent forest and range fires.

04:38.218 --> 04:46.887
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin' the air.

04:46.967 --> 04:51.492
He can find the fire before it starts to flame.

04:51.852 --> 04:56.156
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:56.156 --> 05:14.101
[Music.]
