00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
[Silence.]

00:09.000 --> 00:39.620
[Music.]

00:39.620 --> 00:45.449
Yes, sir, friends, it's Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads, sitting here under the old pine tree.

00:46.991 --> 00:48.273
Just having a good time.

00:48.994 --> 00:51.698
Yeah, we hope that you will have one with us.

00:52.499 --> 00:54.001
We don't mind if you do.

00:54.021 --> 00:57.606
Drag up a chair there and relax and sort of enjoy yourself.

00:57.646 --> 01:01.312
I believe you'll feel more like going about your work after this is over.

01:02.133 --> 01:06.960
You can appreciate life more after you hear this spasm.

01:07.480 --> 01:17.638
Friends, don't forget that the boy from myself, Jelly Elliott and the Knotheads, that is, is brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service.

01:17.658 --> 01:19.301
Now, we got some tunes lined up here.

01:19.321 --> 01:20.604
First, we feature Jack.

01:20.624 --> 01:23.369
We think Jack is one of the outstanding fiddle players of the country.

01:23.689 --> 01:27.396
And here he is with a little ditty called, the Tennessee Wagner.

01:27.396 --> 02:32.505
[Music.]

02:32.505 --> 02:34.423
Get out of the way there, boy.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.603
Quiet Wolf, Tennessee Wagner.

02:37.404 --> 02:39.187
No, Lewis, get away now, you bother me.

02:39.207 --> 02:40.989
We don't want to hear none of that poignant stuff.

02:41.290 --> 02:42.732
Can't stand it right on the start line.

02:42.752 --> 02:44.515
You promised I could read it on this program.

02:45.296 --> 02:47.119
Well, okay, go ahead then, Lewis.

02:47.139 --> 02:50.063
Here's Lewis with one of his poems.

02:51.125 --> 02:53.709
Jack and Jill ran up the water.

02:53.729 --> 02:58.977
The pop let a trash bar run wild in the woods, something he shouldn't have ordered.

03:00.070 --> 03:01.051
Corny!

03:01.191 --> 03:01.792
Ha, ha, ha!

03:02.132 --> 03:04.235
Well, you ate that awful!

03:04.275 --> 03:08.059
Did you ever... And you call that a poet?

03:08.079 --> 03:14.707
Well, you know, come to think of it, by George, I believe that knothead has got something there.

03:14.727 --> 03:19.833
Now, you know, Jack and Jill's papa, he shouldn't have let the trash fire run wild out there.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.057
He should have taken better care of that, but I...

03:23.813 --> 03:32.567
Not only does it come to think of it now and get down to brass tacks, it don't only ruin things, it sets a poor example there in front of the kid.

03:33.107 --> 03:34.490
He ought to be ashamed of his sex.

03:35.531 --> 03:37.875
And it didn't do the woods no good either.

03:37.895 --> 03:42.101
That reminds me about some friends I knew one time.

03:42.121 --> 03:43.283
I knew a family of people.

03:43.343 --> 03:47.910
There was a man and his wife and two young'uns, a little boy and a little girl there.

03:48.772 --> 03:52.217
And one spring there, they decided to clean up around the place.

03:52.687 --> 04:00.420
Well, you know how it looks every spring, the leaves and old dead grass around and everything, and you know how papers collect and everything around the place.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.543
Well, they decided to clean up.

04:02.563 --> 04:04.166
Everybody went to work around there.

04:04.487 --> 04:08.213
Mom and Pop and sister and brother, they all started.

04:08.233 --> 04:11.578
Pop and little boy, Junior, they went to work outside the house.

04:12.079 --> 04:14.083
Mom and the daughter, they went to work in the house.

04:14.203 --> 04:16.787
I mean, they was going to clean up in general their whole city.

04:17.510 --> 04:22.258
Well, Pop, he gets out there and he rakes up all the leaves, him and Junior, and little piles and things.

04:22.278 --> 04:26.545
And then they had a little wash place over there, side of a field of old dead grass there.

04:26.565 --> 04:28.669
The winter rains had kind of washed it out there.

04:28.689 --> 04:33.797
And you know how it's just a habit to kind of rake up the leaves and pile them in a wash place where the

04:34.199 --> 04:35.681
Well, the rains have washed it away.

04:35.721 --> 04:38.706
That's just a habit, I guess, but it's sort of a windrow style.

04:39.247 --> 04:43.975
Well, they pile up the old loose papers and the dry leaves and all that sort of stuff around, you know.

04:44.375 --> 04:48.342
And, of course, he made these in small piles out there.

04:48.922 --> 05:01.202
And then the next thing, it never occurred to him that the fire that he was going to set out there might break out, you see, because he was careful to make it in little piles and things, especially with all four of them.

05:01.570 --> 05:04.244
Well, at the house, you know, they figured they could take care of it.

05:04.686 --> 05:05.490
Well, they sure did.

05:05.510 --> 05:06.636
They taken care of everything.

05:06.737 --> 05:07.742
They really cleaned up.

05:07.762 --> 05:09.370
They made a clean clean.

05:09.923 --> 05:14.930
Mom, she ended up inside by putting ashes in a pasteboard box.

05:14.990 --> 05:17.213
Now, I've seen people do that, haven't you?

05:17.554 --> 05:19.817
Put ashes in a pasteboard box.

05:19.837 --> 05:21.940
Now, she thought the ashes was out, but they wasn't.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.082
There was some coals.

05:23.102 --> 05:26.006
You'll be surprised how long you can keep live coals.

05:26.026 --> 05:34.698
Did you ever go to bed at night and you pile ashes over the coals in the fireplace and you sleep good all night and get up the next morning and drag the ashes off and there's live coals?

05:34.758 --> 05:35.739
Well, that's what Mom done.

05:35.779 --> 05:37.602
She put these coals in this pasteboard box.

05:37.885 --> 05:41.529
And then they carried them out there and strolled them around in these leaves and things, and that started to fire.

05:41.770 --> 05:43.392
Well, it's time for another tune here, friends.

05:43.432 --> 05:45.174
And here we go with a good old tune.

05:45.234 --> 05:46.475
Don't look like it'll ever get old.

05:46.696 --> 05:48.798
I found her little footprint in the snow.

05:57.188 --> 05:58.830
Oh, boy.

06:01.055 --> 06:08.668
Well, some folks like to summertime naked and stroll about.

06:08.902 --> 06:37.845
Oh, look out there, Jack!

06:41.572 --> 06:56.246
Now when I went to see her, there was a big round moon.

06:56.767 --> 07:00.255
Mother said she'd just stepped out, she'd be returning soon.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.523
I found her little footprints.

07:02.543 --> 07:04.747
I found them in the snow.

07:04.767 --> 07:07.431
Found her when the snow's on the ground.

07:08.653 --> 07:11.297
I traced her little footprints in the snow.

07:11.537 --> 07:12.619
In the snow.

07:12.739 --> 07:15.424
I found her little footprints in the snow.

07:15.444 --> 07:16.585
Where'd she go?

07:16.786 --> 07:20.772
God bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way.

07:20.992 --> 07:23.657
I found her when the snow's on the ground.

07:23.837 --> 07:27.002
Now, fill it, Jack.

07:26.982 --> 07:44.684
Well, now she's up in heaven, she's with that angel band.

07:45.064 --> 07:48.468
Someday I'm gonna meet her in the promised land.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.433
Every time the snow falls, it brings back memories.

07:53.037 --> 07:56.741
I found her when the snow was on the ground.

07:56.961 --> 07:59.643
I traced her little footprints in the snow.

07:59.844 --> 08:00.885
In the snow.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.908
I found her little footprints in the snow.

08:03.928 --> 08:05.149
Oh, there'd she go.

08:05.169 --> 08:09.053
I blessed that happy day when Nellie lost her way.

08:09.233 --> 08:12.376
I found her when the snow was on the ground.

08:13.137 --> 08:14.618
Well, all right there, boys.

08:14.658 --> 08:15.259
Thank you a lot.

08:15.299 --> 08:16.880
That's Marty Fire and Carino.

08:16.900 --> 08:17.441
Now, let's see.

08:17.461 --> 08:17.941
Where was that?

08:17.961 --> 08:18.882
Oh, yeah.

08:18.902 --> 08:21.745
Yeah, I was telling about these friends of mine who really clean

08:22.062 --> 08:49.167
clean house. They didn't only clean house they clean place around there. Well sir friends to make a long story short mom she thought the cold was out and 
poppy take them out and throw them around and leave. Junior he is a meddling around in the house they're making a clean sweep and you run across some old 
firecrackers that was left over from the fourth of July and he wanted to see if they was any good so he scattered them around in all the fire see if they'd 
go off. And first thing they knew the leaves out there side of the old field had spread out into the field

08:49.467 --> 08:56.013
and was burning it over, headed right straight for a nice patch of timber out there with a lot of little young pine trees coming on that they really valued.

08:56.514 --> 09:04.581
And they all run out there to put it out, and while they were gone, the firecrackers exploded on the other side of the house, or something exploded over there, and set all that on fire.

09:04.601 --> 09:12.729
Well, to make a long story short, friends had taken all the neighbors in the neighborhood to rush in there and help these people to save their house and outfit.

09:13.330 --> 09:14.811
Now, that's what happened.

09:15.392 --> 09:17.854
So you just can't be too careful with fire.

09:18.273 --> 09:23.120
I'm telling you, you've heard the old expression about never play with fire.

09:23.140 --> 09:26.144
Friends, that's one of the truest sayings that I ever heard.

09:26.164 --> 09:27.365
Never play with fire.

09:28.226 --> 09:30.570
By George, it'll take your life.

09:30.610 --> 09:31.311
No warning.

09:31.331 --> 09:32.312
It never warns you.

09:32.392 --> 09:33.233
It don't bark.

09:33.253 --> 09:34.134
It ain't like a dog.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.558
A dog will bark at you and you know to run.

09:36.578 --> 09:37.519
The fire don't bark.

09:37.639 --> 09:38.380
It don't say nothing.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.001
It'll get you.

09:39.882 --> 09:42.165
Friends, that's what happened to these people.

09:43.507 --> 09:47.993
And I'll just pass that on to you so that you can guard against things of this sort.

09:48.260 --> 09:50.763
and not let these kind of things happen to you.

09:50.783 --> 09:52.285
You just can't be too careful.

09:52.345 --> 09:56.890
Now, these people, if they hadn't have been in such a hurry, I think it was the next day.

09:57.351 --> 09:58.833
Yeah, I'm sure it was the next day.

09:58.873 --> 10:09.746
It'd come a good rain, settled everything, and these people wouldn't have had all this trouble if they hadn't have been in such a hurry for this house cleaning and General Burney.

10:10.507 --> 10:12.569
Friends, you just can't be too impatient.

10:12.589 --> 10:16.514
I mean, don't get too impatient to get a fire job done, ever.

10:16.534 --> 10:17.575
That's the wrong thing.

10:17.943 --> 10:19.084
Don't let this happen to you.

10:19.104 --> 10:19.905
Well, let's see.

10:19.965 --> 10:21.627
I guess we'd better get Herman up here.

10:22.048 --> 10:22.448
Yes, sir.

10:22.649 --> 10:24.210
Miss Populus' little boy, Herman.

10:24.230 --> 10:25.632
That's our favorite son, Herman.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.377
And he's going to play the guitar, the steel guitar, that is.

10:29.397 --> 10:35.364
He calls it the steel guitar ramble.

10:35.524 --> 12:27.777
[Music.]

12:27.777 --> 12:28.418
Thank you, Herman.

12:28.438 --> 12:29.479
Thank you a lot.

12:29.499 --> 12:35.967
Well, friends, I told you about my friends there, what happened to them, and I hope that you'll remember that and never let anything like that happen to you.

12:36.807 --> 12:37.328
Got to go.

12:37.368 --> 12:41.072
We've enjoyed sitting here under the old pine tree and playing for you, friends.

12:41.092 --> 12:44.175
And we hope that you'll come to see us again sometime.

12:44.195 --> 12:46.698
We'll come knocking on your door one of these days.

12:47.119 --> 12:49.502
You listen to the announcer, he'll let you know when we'll be back.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.584
We got to go, as I told you.

12:51.604 --> 12:56.730
But before we go, friends, here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you, and I wish you'd think it over.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.113
Seriously.

12:59.133 --> 13:03.477
Weeds and trash around the house don't look very good, as anyone can see.

13:04.278 --> 13:06.561
But if burning's the answer to getting rid of the stuff,

13:06.997 --> 13:08.439
Call your warden or the lack.

13:08.919 --> 13:09.820
Get him to agree.

13:17.749 --> 13:22.855
Well, friends, there it is.

13:22.875 --> 13:23.676
We've got to go now.

13:23.776 --> 13:29.442
We've enjoyed being here with you, and we hope to see you again real soon.

13:29.462 --> 13:32.085
Now, if you listen to the announcer, he'll let you know when we'll be back.

13:32.605 --> 13:36.750
Friends, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments

13:37.085 --> 13:45.558
of your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service, with the cooperation, of course, of the station that you're now listening to.

13:45.578 --> 13:52.709
Remember, friends, only you can prevent grass and wood fires.

13:52.709 --> 14:30.414
[Music.]
