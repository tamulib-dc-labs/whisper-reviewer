[Music.]

00:15.151 --> 00:19.899
Smokey the bear, Smokey the bear.

00:19.919 --> 00:21.582
Hello there, folks.

00:21.602 --> 00:25.108
This is Smokey, the forest fire-preventing bear.

00:25.128 --> 00:29.916
Those singing friends of mine, the sons of the pioneers, have a song for you.

00:30.297 --> 00:34.885
But first, how about joining us on a little visit to a big star?

00:34.905 --> 00:36.748
Today, it's Dinah Shore.

00:37.409 --> 00:40.855
Miss Dinah, you keep telling folks to see the USA.

00:41.155 --> 00:45.700
How about telling them to be careful with matches and smokes while they're doing it?

00:46.421 --> 00:48.002
I'll be proud to, Smokey.

00:48.022 --> 00:50.145
This is a beautiful country we live in.

00:50.165 --> 00:58.274
The forests and the grasslands, the clear lakes and fast-running streams help to make her beautiful and so enjoyable for all of us.

00:58.294 --> 01:01.297
But we must keep these resources free from careless fire.

01:01.978 --> 01:05.501
Friends, every car has at least one ashtray.

01:05.521 --> 01:08.324
Let's remember to use it every time we have a smoke.

01:08.344 --> 01:10.707
Let's go on seeing the USA and loving her.

01:11.108 --> 01:12.890
But let's protect her at the same time.

01:13.270 --> 01:14.131
Thank you, Dinah.

01:14.652 --> 01:17.315
The Sons of the Pioneers here feel just as you do.

01:17.816 --> 01:20.939
Listen while they sing The Touch of God's Hand.

01:23.522 --> 01:37.538
The prairie sun sends down its ray to warm my heart through every day.

01:38.159 --> 01:50.871
The starlight beams that guides my way are just the touch of God's hand.

01:51.432 --> 02:03.964
The scattered pearls of morning blue, the rainbow mist on hills of blue,

02:04.720 --> 02:24.147
The silver veil of moonbeams too Is just the touch of God's hand. The desert breeze that brushed my hair,

02:24.700 --> 02:43.992
the leave that fell from who knows where, the scent of wild flowers in the air is just the touch of God's hand.

02:44.427 --> 02:50.374
The wasteland call that fills the sky,

02:51.195 --> 02:57.021
The hum of wild wings sailing by,

02:57.882 --> 03:09.135
The warm earth bed on which I lie is just the touch of God's hand.

03:10.752 --> 03:36.405
The desert yields a water pool, where wild things meet their throats to cool, and I'm a carefree, happy fool I know the touch of God's hand

03:37.111 --> 03:43.158
The rain that falls, I love so dear,

03:43.979 --> 03:50.727
And joy is mine just living here,

03:50.747 --> 03:56.334
I know God must be standing near,

03:57.135 --> 04:01.860
I felt the touch of his hand.

04:03.683 --> 04:04.924
I felt

04:05.225 --> 04:11.100
The touch of God's hand

04:12.177 --> 04:14.079
Well, that's it for now, folks.

04:14.099 --> 04:16.042
Thanks a lot for spending this time with us.

04:16.362 --> 04:21.048
You know, it's your own State Forestry Department, along with the Forest Service, U.S.

04:21.088 --> 04:25.994
Department of Agriculture, and this station you're listening to that make these get-togethers possible.

04:26.535 --> 04:37.729
Until we say hello there again and pay another little visit to another big star, this is Smokey and his pals, the Sons of the Pioneers, asking you to always remember.

04:37.709 --> 04:40.534
Only you can prevent forest and woods fires.

04:40.634 --> 04:49.508
Smokey the Bear, Smokey the Bear, prowlin' and a-growlin' and a-sniffin the air.

04:49.969 --> 04:53.915
He can find a fire before it starts to flame.

04:53.935 --> 04:58.823
That's why they call him Smokey, that was how he got his name.

04:58.823 --> 05:17.107
