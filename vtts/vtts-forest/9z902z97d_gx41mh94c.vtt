WEBVTT

00:34.237 --> 00:37.661
Well, thank you, boys.

00:37.681 --> 00:38.622
Thank you a whole lot.

00:38.942 --> 00:39.663
How are you, friends?

00:39.683 --> 00:40.123
How are y'all?

00:40.544 --> 00:41.505
Yes, hereby, George.

00:41.525 --> 00:41.985
Here it is.

00:42.086 --> 00:45.009
Once again, time for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads.

00:45.549 --> 00:49.534
Sitting here under the old pine tree, just relaxing, having a good time.

00:50.395 --> 00:53.618
And we do hope that you'll stand by there for a few minutes.

00:54.139 --> 00:57.402
If you ain't got nothing to do, stick around a few minutes.

00:57.422 --> 00:58.604
We'd like to have you listen.

00:58.984 --> 01:02.708
We'll do our best to play some of these old corny hillbilly tunes that

01:03.177 --> 01:04.960
Well, you might like one of them.

01:05.020 --> 01:06.763
Now, we'll be on for several minutes.

01:07.644 --> 01:10.188
If you don't like it to start with, don't get excited.

01:10.228 --> 01:11.530
Just keep us tuned here.

01:11.590 --> 01:12.892
We'll be on for a long time.

01:12.952 --> 01:14.655
Maybe you'll get to like it before it's over with.

01:16.157 --> 01:17.599
So here we go with the first tune.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.083
Features our little steel man.

01:20.103 --> 01:31.581
That's her Mrs. Poplin's favorite son, Herman, with his double-barreled Ethiopian steam-heated butane-burning guitar and the blue steel blues.

01:52.807 --> 02:08.217
Thank you.

02:24.059 --> 02:28.164
All right, son, thank you a lot there.

02:28.505 --> 02:33.251
Friends, that was Herman doing the blues to your blues.

02:33.271 --> 02:34.693
That's mighty fine, Herman.

02:34.713 --> 02:37.897
Remind me to call you back up here in just a few minutes, son, to do another.

02:38.878 --> 02:45.106
Then, I wanted to tell you a little story here, if you all ain't doing nothing and you don't mind.

02:45.787 --> 02:52.075
If you got just a few minutes, I wanted to tell you a little story here about a man that went through the woods just deliberately.

02:53.152 --> 02:55.875
setting the woods on fire.

02:55.895 --> 02:56.776
Now, I know him.

02:56.796 --> 02:57.537
I know him, yeah.

02:58.017 --> 03:03.983
I know him, and that's why I know so much about it, you see, because I know the man.

03:04.003 --> 03:06.866
He went through the woods just deliberately setting them on fire.

03:08.428 --> 03:09.989
Well, the fire broke out.

03:10.070 --> 03:17.337
The fire boys spotted the smoke, called in the fire boys, the crew, you know, that goes around and plows a

03:17.789 --> 03:24.779
the fire lanes and get the flaps and the wet toe sacks and what have you and beat out the fire and put it out, you see.

03:24.799 --> 03:26.261
Them's the boys that really swept.

03:26.602 --> 03:31.429
Well, anyway, I know all about this particular case, and I wanted to pass it on to you, neighbors.

03:31.509 --> 03:34.433
I thought maybe you'd be interested in this little story.

03:34.453 --> 03:38.880
I know all about it, and it's interesting to me, and I thought maybe you'd like to hear about it.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.422
Well, we called in the bloodhound.

03:40.975 --> 03:46.001
The fire broke out, and nobody knew where or where what goes, you see.

03:46.361 --> 03:56.692
But the fire boys found some tracks in the mud right there where this particular guy that set these woods on fire just deliberately was running.

03:57.233 --> 04:06.824
I mean, a thief, I don't care how bad he is or how many pistols he totes or carries or how many machine guns, he's a coward.

04:07.264 --> 04:08.365
He's always a coward.

04:08.385 --> 04:09.767
He'll run for dear life.

04:10.338 --> 04:13.061
And that's what this particular character was doing.

04:13.081 --> 04:16.224
He had set these woods on fire, and he was running for dear life.

04:16.825 --> 04:19.668
And we found his track, or at least they did.

04:19.688 --> 04:20.970
Well, we got the bloodhounds.

04:22.091 --> 04:24.634
And a bloodhound, friends, is a hound dog.

04:25.114 --> 04:29.959
A lot of people refer to a hound dog, well, he's just an old hound dog.

04:29.979 --> 04:31.341
Well, that's what he is.

04:31.361 --> 04:34.705
But he's got his points the same as you've got your points.

04:34.725 --> 04:35.926
He's got a wonderful nose.

04:35.966 --> 04:37.968
He's a nice dog.

04:37.988 --> 04:39.670
He don't mean no harm to nobody.

04:40.527 --> 04:43.994
or nothing like that, but he's a good dog.

04:44.014 --> 04:48.783
Well, we got the hound dogs, and we brought them in on the scene, or they did.

04:49.124 --> 05:02.130
I want to tell you all about this hound dog story, so you dog lovers out there, stay tuned here just a minute while we fiddle up another tune here, and I think this tune here is very appropriate for this particular program.

05:02.363 --> 05:05.348
And maybe you'll agree with me if you'll just stay tuned there and listen.

05:05.989 --> 05:10.215
And we're going to call Jack up here with the help of all the boys and myself, the knotheads, that is.

05:10.616 --> 05:12.138
I'm going to hunting with you, Jack.

05:12.218 --> 05:13.059
Blow the horn, son.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.421
Blow the horn while I'm getting ready.

05:15.603 --> 05:16.805
Yeah, call the dogs, son.

05:16.845 --> 05:17.847
Call them up here.

05:17.867 --> 05:20.731
Help, help, help, whoo!

05:20.751 --> 05:23.275
Well, the dogs is coming, and we're getting ready here, friends.

05:23.295 --> 05:25.418
We're going to have a fox chase.

05:25.438 --> 05:26.941
And we're going to call Jack in.

05:27.021 --> 05:28.803
Here we go, son.

05:28.824 --> 05:29.805
Fox chase.

05:32.654 --> 05:34.976
Blow the horn, Jack.

05:35.056 --> 05:36.217
Blow the horn.

05:36.658 --> 05:37.638
I'm calling, dog.

05:37.839 --> 05:38.760
Blow the horn.

05:39.000 --> 05:39.600
Call them.

05:39.640 --> 05:39.941
Help!

05:39.981 --> 05:40.281
Help!

05:40.341 --> 05:40.881
Help!

05:41.142 --> 05:41.342
Woo!

05:41.382 --> 05:42.022
Help, Red.

05:42.042 --> 05:42.283
Help!

05:42.303 --> 05:42.823
Help!

05:42.883 --> 05:43.043
Help!

05:43.103 --> 05:43.884
Help!

05:44.865 --> 05:53.633
I hear one of them come out from the house.

05:53.793 --> 05:57.236
Yeah, they come out from the house.

05:57.256 --> 05:58.257
There they come.

05:58.277 --> 05:59.038
They're coming.

05:59.218 --> 06:01.480
They're going to move.

06:02.759 --> 06:03.862
It rings up.

06:03.882 --> 06:05.906
Whoo!

06:06.568 --> 06:09.575
There's them little pups out here.

06:09.595 --> 06:11.038
Oh, my goodness gracious.

06:11.078 --> 06:12.742
There's him fires.

06:12.762 --> 06:14.085
Get out of here.

06:14.453 --> 06:17.378
We don't want them fights.

06:17.398 --> 06:18.781
There we go.

06:18.821 --> 06:20.083
Whoo!

06:20.103 --> 06:34.148
Uh-oh, that's old Blue.

06:34.188 --> 06:35.230
He's got a tail, boy.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.192
He smells him.

06:36.745 --> 06:44.373
Oh, he's got him going now, boy.

06:44.393 --> 06:47.196
Oh, there's them young dogs there.

06:47.216 --> 06:51.521
That's them puppies.

06:51.641 --> 06:59.048
Oh, they got him, ain't they?

06:59.068 --> 07:02.232
Oh, he's lost his tail.

07:02.252 --> 07:03.273
Oh, he got a little off there.

07:03.293 --> 07:03.673
Let's go.

07:03.693 --> 07:04.054
Let's go.

07:04.114 --> 07:05.335
Let's train him, son.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.806
Oh, they got him now.

07:12.367 --> 07:27.806
Well, friends, there it is.

07:28.146 --> 07:31.570
Just a little dab, dab and a half, two dabs of the fox chase.

07:31.590 --> 07:33.272
We like to never trade that rounder.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.355
I'm telling you, that was one of them hill coons.

07:35.757 --> 07:36.819
He's long-legged.

07:36.879 --> 07:38.281
He run a long time.

07:39.522 --> 07:42.266
But old Tiger, he finally treated him.

07:42.366 --> 07:44.229
I'm telling you, that's a good dog.

07:45.090 --> 07:45.511
Oh, me.

07:46.212 --> 07:49.577
Well, I just wanted to tell a story here.

07:51.399 --> 07:52.621
Not a fib now, friends.

07:52.681 --> 07:53.082
Not a fib.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.904
A story.

07:54.924 --> 08:03.416
About a fellow I knew that just deliberately set fire over the woods there.

08:03.436 --> 08:05.359
And how he hurt everybody.

08:06.520 --> 08:16.412
I mean, this particular character, friends, I can't call names because it would be embarrassing to his kin people and all that sort of stuff, so I don't call any names.

08:16.532 --> 08:21.357
But this particular incident, this guy went through the woods and just sat on fire.

08:22.599 --> 08:28.586
Well, we got the bloodhound, and they got on his trail.

08:28.606 --> 08:35.734
That's all they knew was to trail this particular character of this scent that they smelled, which was his feet,

08:36.254 --> 08:38.356
So we had a fine chase.

08:38.396 --> 08:39.197
They carried me.

08:39.377 --> 08:40.819
I was in this chase, neighbors.

08:41.299 --> 08:41.800
I was there.

08:42.220 --> 08:43.041
I was right along with them.

08:43.101 --> 08:44.262
I was following these dogs.

08:44.903 --> 08:45.523
And here they went.

08:47.245 --> 08:49.668
They were arguing about all this sort of stuff, you know.

08:50.188 --> 08:53.251
Over hills and down through the valleys, we swam creeks.

08:53.331 --> 08:56.915
We waded slews and first one thing enough.

08:56.935 --> 09:00.959
And finally, we come up to a little shack out in the woods.

09:01.820 --> 09:05.704
Well, them old dogs, they come on up there, you know, and there's where they treed.

09:05.988 --> 09:10.592
I mean, they bathed the tree, or whatever you want to call it, but that's where it rose in.

09:10.632 --> 09:11.693
That's as far as it went.

09:13.514 --> 09:19.479
Well, we went in, and this particular guy was there, and he admitted the whole thing.

09:21.441 --> 09:35.353
Well, friends, to make a long story short, this very guy that deliberately went out and struck a man set fire to the wood, burned up all the little trees, the squirrels, the coons, the possums, the fox,

09:36.059 --> 09:36.880
everything.

09:38.681 --> 09:41.084
Boy, I'm telling you, it beats anything.

09:41.224 --> 09:42.685
But he burned up the whole thing.

09:43.006 --> 09:46.609
The little trees, little pine trees coming there, struggling.

09:46.749 --> 09:51.334
I mean, the Lord put them there for us, for you, for me.

09:51.354 --> 09:54.096
And he goes out there and sets it on fire and burns up the whole thing.

09:55.598 --> 09:59.321
Well, the bloodhounds trailed him down, and we found him there in the shack.

09:59.782 --> 10:00.262
I was there.

10:00.722 --> 10:02.044
Of course, I was just with him.

10:03.725 --> 10:04.446
And when we

10:05.101 --> 10:14.331
talked to the man, and after everything was thrashed out and all, the fire boomerang had come right back to his own front door, and he lost as much as anybody else.

10:15.272 --> 10:18.175
I can't figure these things out, neighbors, and maybe you can.

10:18.255 --> 10:19.196
Think it over, will you?

10:19.416 --> 10:20.357
Here's the next tune.

10:21.539 --> 10:26.023
And this is the nice tune, and the boys and myself try to do a good job on it.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.745
We're going to get serious here for a minute.

10:27.945 --> 10:30.688
So if you ain't doing nothing, pull up here and listen there.

10:30.969 --> 10:32.070
I believe you'll like it.

10:32.530 --> 10:33.331
We hope you do.

10:33.672 --> 10:34.973
Where could I go?

10:35.172 --> 10:36.033
but to the Lord.

10:42.400 --> 10:51.270
Living below them this old sinful world, hardly a comfort can afford.

10:52.551 --> 11:01.821
Striving alone to face temptation soar, where could I go but to the Lord?

11:02.948 --> 11:05.712
Where could I go?

11:05.732 --> 11:07.734
Where could I go?

11:08.355 --> 11:13.582
Seeking a refuge for my soul.

11:13.602 --> 11:18.749
Needing a friend to save me in the end.

11:18.769 --> 11:21.953
Where could I go but to the Lord?

11:44.596 --> 11:49.905
Neighbors of kind, I love them, everyone.

11:49.925 --> 11:55.033
We get along in sweet accord.

11:55.053 --> 12:03.487
But when my soul needs manners from above, where could I go but to the Lord?

12:05.510 --> 12:08.134
Where could I go?

12:08.154 --> 12:10.418
Oh, where could I go?

12:10.398 --> 12:16.685
Seeking a refuge for my soul.

12:16.705 --> 12:21.110
Leading a friend to save me in the end.

12:21.131 --> 12:27.258
Where could I go but to the Lord?

12:28.279 --> 12:28.960
Thank you, boys.

12:29.000 --> 12:29.360
Thank you.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.321
There it is, friends.

12:30.361 --> 12:33.064
That's an old tune that'll never get old there.

12:33.104 --> 12:35.387
Where could I go but to the Lord?

12:35.707 --> 12:37.890
I don't know of any better place to go.

12:38.883 --> 12:42.406
Friends, we've run out of time here in spite of everything we can do.

12:42.687 --> 12:44.788
The old clock on the wall says we've got to go.

12:45.649 --> 12:50.274
So before we go, though, here's just a little thought that I'd like to leave with you.

12:51.074 --> 12:58.501
And I would like for you to keep this in mind, all you little rabbit twisters out there, mom and daddy and all of you.

12:58.521 --> 13:08.130
A fellow who deliberately causes fire to break out, he may think no one's got him in sight, but the Lord

13:09.595 --> 13:10.896
He knows what's going on.

13:11.877 --> 13:16.101
Someday, he'll make that feller act right.

13:17.522 --> 13:32.275
Well, there it is, friends.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.219
Our little old visit has come to an end with you.

13:36.259 --> 13:38.961
We've enjoyed sitting here under the old pine tree.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.582
picking and yodeling for you.

13:41.622 --> 13:46.649
We do hope that you've enjoyed it and will come our way next time we come your way.

13:47.250 --> 13:50.335
Oh, you're good neighbors, all of you.

13:51.276 --> 13:55.041
Friends, don't forget the announcer will let you know when we'll be back.

13:55.061 --> 14:04.555
This program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service.

14:06.598 --> 14:09.943
Remember, friends, only you

14:10.193 --> 14:13.671
can prevent woods firing.

14:13.873 --> 14:14.095
Hallelujah!

14:41.345 --> 14:43.086
Thank you.
