00:05.785 --> 00:33.410
[Music.]

00:33.410 --> 00:35.051
Thank you there, knotheads.

00:35.932 --> 00:38.675
Boys, thank you, men.

00:39.035 --> 00:40.236
Friends, here it is once again.

00:40.276 --> 00:44.000
Time for Jelly Elliott and the Three Knotheads are sitting here under the old pine tree.

00:44.380 --> 00:45.541
Just hooping and hollering.

00:45.561 --> 00:49.365
We're going to holler real loud so that you can hear it way out there.

00:49.705 --> 00:51.687
Turn the radio up real loud.

00:51.727 --> 00:55.230
Maybe the old man down there in the field plowing can hear some of it.

00:55.250 --> 00:58.052
We're going to get Robert with his garden seed fiddle.

00:58.313 --> 01:02.016
And here he is to make a lot of its fly and its Dragging the Boat.

01:04.561 --> 02:06.593
Yeah, let's go.

02:06.593 --> 02:09.798
I like that.

02:09.818 --> 02:13.663
I'm telling you, that shaving haircut business, they done went up to $2.06.

02:13.703 --> 02:15.686
Oh, boy.

02:16.647 --> 02:17.949
Dragging the Boat.

02:18.390 --> 02:25.059
Friends, you know, it's really amazing how a lot of wood fires get started.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.621
It's really funny.

02:27.442 --> 02:30.927
You take, you got a lot of people that burns off the woods to kill the ticks.

02:30.947 --> 02:31.789
Can you imagine that?

02:31.809 --> 02:32.369
Kill the ticks.

02:32.389 --> 02:34.913
They'd have to burn up all the cows and the turtles and

02:35.315 --> 02:37.098
And just a lot of stuff to kill a tick.

02:37.118 --> 02:38.620
You can't kill ticks with fire.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.183
They burn off the woods to kill boll weevils.

02:41.684 --> 02:43.567
The boll weevils got more sense than the man had.

02:43.587 --> 02:46.791
He goes down in an old wet chunk and you never could burn him out of there.

02:47.232 --> 02:48.874
And they burn the woods off to kill snakes.

02:48.894 --> 02:53.641
Well, the snake, he runs in a hole and the fire passes over and he comes out and you step on him and he bites you.

02:54.102 --> 02:54.963
That takes care of that.

02:55.904 --> 02:56.886
It just can't be done.

02:56.906 --> 02:59.770
You know, I knew a fellow one time, friends, up there in the country.

03:00.475 --> 03:02.761
He'd been in town all day, and he was rushing home.

03:02.821 --> 03:05.869
He was tired, wanting to get home, just like all the rest of us country boys.

03:05.889 --> 03:07.694
We'd go to town, we'd come home, give out.

03:08.255 --> 03:15.514
Well, he was on his way home, and as he'd come by his neighbor's house, one of his neighbor's old Darmanerca hens flew out ahead of him, and he'd kill that chicken, run over him.

03:15.916 --> 03:17.619
Well, he didn't know that, though.

03:17.639 --> 03:21.845
He told me himself after it was all over, we got everything squared away.

03:22.226 --> 03:24.449
He told me he didn't know he'd run over that chicken.

03:24.469 --> 03:27.093
He'd have been glad to stop and paid his neighbor for him.

03:27.113 --> 03:35.967
But his neighbor got awful mad about it, and he slipped off down there in the back of the field, and he took a puff or two off his cigarette and thought he got the direction of the wind.

03:35.947 --> 03:37.169
But it'll fool you, friends.

03:37.209 --> 03:38.291
It'll fool you bad, too.

03:38.712 --> 03:54.698
So he set a little fire there and some grass in the edge of his field with the wind he figured right, and it would go on over into his neighbor's pasture there and go through the pasture and on out into the woods and just burn off, see, and he'd get revenge for that

03:54.965 --> 03:57.228
guy running over his dominecker hen.

03:57.689 --> 04:00.413
But instead of that, friends, it's just like it's often happened.

04:00.633 --> 04:03.277
The wind blows from a lot of directions at one time.

04:03.597 --> 04:05.260
Maybe you don't realize that, but they do.

04:05.660 --> 04:14.072
And the wind switched, and the fire come back through his own field up towards his house, burned up his chicken house, and some of his hens smothered from the smoke.

04:14.813 --> 04:18.238
And the neighbors come in, and right away they

04:18.488 --> 04:20.711
started fighting the fire to keep it out of the woods.

04:21.032 --> 04:27.061
They didn't pay much attention to the chicken house because he could build back another chicken house there within a few hours time.

04:27.081 --> 04:31.588
But it'd take him several years to grow back another forest there, woods.

04:31.608 --> 04:33.230
So they fought the fire.

04:33.250 --> 04:37.016
But it was some wranglement around there trying to get that fire put out.

04:37.176 --> 04:41.323
And that was all he was cutting off his nose to spite his face, friends.

04:41.343 --> 04:42.985
That's what he was doing.

04:43.005 --> 04:46.791
Now he went down there, called himself going to get revenge on his neighbor.

04:47.395 --> 04:49.037
which was a very wrong thing to do.

04:49.137 --> 05:01.511
If he'd have hailed his neighbor down or even sent him word that he'd run over one of his fine hens and he wanted $2 or $5 or whatever his price might be on the chicken, well, his neighbor would have been glad to pay him for it.

05:01.591 --> 05:08.919
He wasn't thinking about running over a chicken, had his mind on some of his business, and he just wasn't paying attention and didn't even know that he'd run over the chicken.

05:08.939 --> 05:13.865
Then this man goes and burns up his own chicken house now trying to get even with the other fella.

05:14.225 --> 05:15.106
Can you imagine that?

05:15.567 --> 05:16.828
Well, that actually happened.

05:17.298 --> 05:18.919
Things like that happens every day.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.542
They do, for a fact.

05:21.562 --> 05:23.063
Friends, let's just watch that stuff.

05:23.303 --> 05:25.525
We don't want nothing like that to happen to us.

05:25.545 --> 05:28.288
Now don't you know that man was a laughing stock of the country around.

05:28.408 --> 05:31.550
Everybody poked fun at him and laughed at him about it.

05:31.571 --> 05:32.852
Wouldn't you feel mighty little?

05:33.492 --> 05:33.853
I would.

05:34.773 --> 05:37.015
So be careful with those sort of things.

05:37.035 --> 05:39.037
Here's Slim to sing this next tune.

05:39.417 --> 05:43.101
It is a tearjerker, so get out your squall rags and get ready to weep.

05:43.121 --> 05:46.984
Slim's gonna give forth with a sad little thing called I'll Be True.

05:46.984 --> 05:56.937
[Music.]

05:56.937 --> 06:17.528
Please come back to me, my darling. Has your love grown dead and cold? You know that I love you, darling,

06:19.364 --> 06:49.101
More than this world and all this gold. Every night I pray for you dear. It makes no difference where you roam. May the good Lord up in heaven

06:50.465 --> 07:12.743
Protect and guide your footsteps home. Till the end of time, my darlin' Till the stars no longer shine

07:13.567 --> 07:28.870
I'll be true to you, my darling. Love you till the end of time.

07:28.870 --> 07:40.094
[Music.]

07:40.094 --> 08:01.900
I'll be waiting for you, darling With tear-dimmed eyes from day to day, Even though in death I'm taken

08:02.960 --> 08:26.723
From this world no more to stay Then at last way up in heaven. The angels there will hear my vow

08:26.939 --> 08:44.087
that I will always love you darling. I love you then as I do now. Till the end

08:46.328 --> 09:10.142
of time my darling, till the stars no longer shine, I'll be true to you my darling, love you till

09:11.371 --> 09:16.862
The end of time.

09:16.882 --> 09:17.583
Thank you, Slim.

09:17.683 --> 09:18.585
Thank you there, buddy.

09:18.605 --> 09:20.529
That's mighty fine carrying on.

09:20.549 --> 09:21.811
That's all right.

09:22.513 --> 09:25.919
Friends, you know people are getting more and more wise every day.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.062
They're smart enough.

09:27.422 --> 09:27.923
That's right.

09:28.004 --> 09:28.585
They really are.

09:28.625 --> 09:31.611
They're waking up to the fact that we've got to take care of this timber.

09:31.931 --> 09:32.873
We've got to have it.

09:33.325 --> 09:37.771
And they're getting more careful with their trash burning and all that sort of thing.

09:37.811 --> 09:44.178
That's really nice, too, friends, because every time we have a fire, regardless of how small it is, it costs.

09:44.198 --> 09:44.719
It costs.

09:44.759 --> 09:47.943
Now, you can just put that in your pipe and smoke it.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.785
But, friends, we're not careful enough.

09:49.805 --> 09:52.288
We've got to be a lot more careful.

09:52.309 --> 09:53.170
That's all there is to it.

09:53.210 --> 10:00.719
We've got to realize that this timber and this pulpwood and other forest products, that we're getting more and more important, all of us.

10:00.739 --> 10:02.421
We've just got to have it for our country.

10:02.654 --> 10:03.835
And everybody.

10:03.855 --> 10:06.538
And after all, the country is everybody.

10:06.558 --> 10:07.359
And that's us.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.041
You and me.

10:09.061 --> 10:10.142
And we've got to take care of it.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.206
I can't do it by myself and you can't do it by yourself.

10:13.266 --> 10:15.669
But, boy, we can all get together and do it.

10:15.689 --> 10:17.411
I'll guarantee you.

10:17.431 --> 10:22.676
Now, friends, you know, when you take care of a little old patch of wood there, it can really swell your bank account.

10:23.357 --> 10:23.778
It can.

10:24.118 --> 10:24.979
If it's handled right.

10:25.640 --> 10:26.981
And if it's protected from fire.

10:27.242 --> 10:29.404
Now, that's where your local forestry boy comes in.

10:29.764 --> 10:30.265
Right there.

10:30.548 --> 10:36.894
When you get ready to cut this timber, you need some cash, you say, well, I can sell off a few of these trees out there down in the pasture.

10:36.914 --> 10:39.116
Go down and cut them biggest ones.

10:39.136 --> 10:42.759
Well, if you'll call in that local forestry boy, maybe you shouldn't cut the biggest ones.

10:42.779 --> 10:46.362
He'll come down and help you, and I'll guarantee you, friends, you'll come out winter.

10:46.482 --> 10:50.826
You'll wind up with more cash and still have good trees left and all that sort of thing.

10:51.587 --> 10:52.868
So consult him.

10:53.228 --> 10:55.971
That's what he's out there for, and he'll be mighty glad to help you.

10:56.211 --> 10:57.873
Here goes me, friends.

10:57.893 --> 10:59.374
I'm knocking at your door.

11:08.973 --> 11:35.301
I'm knockin' at your door again, my darling. I'm knockin' at your door, please let me in. I've got to make you realize, my darling 
Had no one else who's ever meant for me. Well, you told me once, sweetheart, you'd always loved me And that no one else could ever come between

11:36.412 --> 11:39.816
But last night I saw you, darling, with another.

11:41.397 --> 11:44.521
And now today my heart is set in blue.

11:44.781 --> 12:04.508
[Music.]

12:04.508 --> 12:13.917
Well, I'm knocking at your door again, my darling, to return the letters that you wrote to me.

12:13.937 --> 12:21.644
I won't ever need them now, my little darling, for I'm sailing far across the deep blue sea.

12:24.386 --> 12:25.727
Well, thank you, boys.

12:25.747 --> 12:26.088
Thank you.

12:26.108 --> 12:26.848
There it is.

12:26.908 --> 12:28.870
The best I can do, I'm knocking at your door.

12:28.970 --> 12:31.933
Friends, the old clock up here says we got to shove off.

12:33.078 --> 12:36.082
Got to get out from under the old pine tree and move along down the trail.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.446
We've really enjoyed visiting with you.

12:38.866 --> 12:42.151
Here's just a little thought for the day that I'd like to leave with you, friends.

12:42.692 --> 12:44.494
Think this over now.

12:44.514 --> 12:52.085
Burning for things such as snakes, ticks, and bull weevil don't do any good, and besides, it's plumb evil.

12:53.507 --> 12:54.228
Ho!

12:54.248 --> 12:54.328
Hey!

12:54.348 --> 12:56.030
All right, let's go again.

12:56.050 --> 12:58.073
Hang on the bandwagon down there.

12:58.314 --> 12:59.355
There we are to go.

13:01.394 --> 13:12.707
Friends and knotheads and myself have really enjoyed visiting with you today, and the knotheads, myself, Jelly Elliott, that is.

13:12.727 --> 13:16.111
We've really enjoyed it a whole lot, and we hope you've enjoyed it.

13:16.131 --> 13:28.785
And don't forget, friends, that we are brought to you with the best wishes and compliments of your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:29.204 --> 13:32.347
He'll, the station announcer will let you know when we'll be back, friends.

13:32.407 --> 13:33.348
Tune us in, won't you?

13:33.628 --> 13:38.410
Remember, friends, only you can prevent woods fires.

13:38.410 --> 14:02.00
[Music.]
