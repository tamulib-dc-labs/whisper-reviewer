00:40.902 --> 00:42.164
Hello, all right.

00:42.184 --> 00:42.805
Thank you, boys.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.086
Thank you a lot and howdy, friends.

00:44.106 --> 00:45.188
How are y'all?

00:45.208 --> 00:46.069
Yep, you guessed it.

00:46.129 --> 00:50.535
It's me again, Jelly Elliott, the old woods rider, and all the knotheads.

00:50.555 --> 00:53.239
Friends, we're gathered up here under the big old pine tree again.

00:53.299 --> 00:59.908
We're fixing to play a few tunes for you, and we've got a few things we want to talk over with you about the woods and the forest and such.

01:00.749 --> 01:05.796
So just pull up a chair there and relax, and we'll do our best to play some of these tunes that you

01:06.232 --> 01:10.645
We're going to start off with Bob Henderson here, our hoedown fiddle player.

01:10.705 --> 01:13.393
And by the way, Bob is a champion hoedown fiddle player.

01:14.055 --> 01:15.218
And he's going to cut loose here.

01:15.258 --> 01:18.187
We'll just dedicate this tune to the state of Arkansas.

01:18.207 --> 01:20.072
It's called the Arkansas Traveler.

01:39.627 --> 01:40.391
Thank you.

02:13.765 --> 02:14.686
Well, thank you, Bob.

02:14.726 --> 02:17.609
Thank you a lot there for Arkansas Traveler.

02:17.629 --> 02:21.093
Now, friends, I wanted to talk to you a little bit here about carelessness.

02:21.113 --> 02:22.394
Just a little about carelessness.

02:23.135 --> 02:28.300
I wanted to talk to you about people, how careful some people are, yet at times they're careless.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.864
Now, you just stop and think there with me just a minute, and you know yourself.

02:32.004 --> 02:38.811
You're probably, you sitting right there listening to me, you're probably just as careful as you can be, but at times you get careless.

02:38.831 --> 02:42.355
And I know of a story of three loggers here, as I

02:42.908 --> 02:44.810
was going to tell you about these three loggers.

02:45.531 --> 02:47.353
I guess you think I know a lot.

02:47.373 --> 02:49.976
Well, I do about the woods because I'm in the woods.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.458
Every day I live in the woods.

02:51.478 --> 02:52.339
I stay in the woods.

02:52.439 --> 02:55.343
And I know of these cases that I tell you about.

02:55.403 --> 02:57.265
I know of them happening.

02:57.285 --> 03:00.769
This particular case, there were three men there that made their living in the woods.

03:00.829 --> 03:01.490
They were loggers.

03:02.351 --> 03:06.937
And they caught their rider every morning side of the road, side of the highway.

03:07.758 --> 03:09.760
And it come a little cold snap.

03:10.263 --> 03:13.667
just a little cold snap, and it was kind of cool this particular morning.

03:14.348 --> 03:16.450
So they decided they'd build them a fire.

03:16.470 --> 03:21.236
Now, mind you, keep in mind that these three men were grown, intelligent men and made their living in the woods.

03:22.217 --> 03:25.500
And they were going to build them a warming fire there.

03:25.520 --> 03:32.769
So they cleaned off a big place there where they'd be sure that this fire wouldn't get out because, after all, they didn't want the woods to burn over.

03:32.809 --> 03:34.190
They were very much against it.

03:35.272 --> 03:39.156
Well, after they went to all this trouble to clean off this place to build a fire, then they were

03:39.372 --> 03:49.705
they built their fire right up against a big old dead snag there so that the snag would reflect the heat out against them, which I've seen that happen lots of times.

03:49.785 --> 03:51.007
I've even done it myself.

03:51.668 --> 03:53.711
Years ago, I've done it myself.

03:53.731 --> 03:58.797
Well, they sat around there by the fire and kept warm until their ride come along.

03:58.817 --> 04:02.061
But when their ride come along, they knew they didn't have anything to worry about.

04:02.101 --> 04:08.029
At least they thought they didn't because they'd cleaned off the ground perfectly all around there and there wasn't a chance for a spark to get out.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.107
and get the woods on fire.

04:10.627 --> 04:13.731
So they had everything well under control, they thought.

04:14.512 --> 04:19.377
So when their ride come along, well, they run out and got in the truck and went on to the woods.

04:19.397 --> 04:28.367
And three days later, friends, three days later, after these fellows had built this fire, well, we got a call on a fire, a woods fire.

04:29.088 --> 04:30.049
So we went out there.

04:30.689 --> 04:32.451
And that's where it started from.

04:32.511 --> 04:35.835
I want to tell you just how it got started and all about it in just a minute.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.438
But I guess we better play a tune along about now

04:38.806 --> 04:42.210
So we're going to call Charlie up to the microphone here, Charlie Stuckey.

04:42.670 --> 04:44.552
He does a good job on this tune here.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.375
And the name of it is, I Made a Mistake.

04:54.804 --> 05:01.431
I made a mistake and I'm sorry.

05:01.451 --> 05:05.235
Sorry as sorry can be.

05:07.747 --> 05:20.044
I didn't know you were fooling, making believe you loved me.

05:20.064 --> 05:29.738
You gave all your love to another and left me for somebody new.

05:32.536 --> 05:38.678
I've made a mistake and I'm sorry.

05:38.999 --> 05:42.833
Sorry for me, not for you.

06:11.146 --> 06:11.788
.

06:11.808 --> 06:12.550
.

06:12.570 --> 06:24.345
.

06:34.113 --> 06:46.549
If I had only known you were teasing, I'd have kept all my love from you.

06:46.569 --> 06:56.121
I wouldn't be here alone, agreeing, crying my eyes out for you.

06:58.953 --> 07:24.128
Give all your love to another And left me for somebody new I made a mistake And I'm sorry Sorry for me, not for you Thank you, Charlie, thank you.

07:24.148 --> 07:25.350
That's a mighty nice tune.

07:25.370 --> 07:27.593
Now, I think I'll just dedicate that tune to these

07:27.826 --> 07:30.789
Three loggers here that made a mistake.

07:30.869 --> 07:32.771
They made a mistake, a bad one.

07:32.791 --> 07:37.215
As I told you, they built that fire upside that dead tree, big old snag there.

07:37.855 --> 07:43.821
And it never once occurred to them that after they were gone that the tree would burn down, but it did.

07:43.921 --> 07:51.148
Three days later, the tree burned down and fell out in the woods, out where it wasn't cleaned off, and it set the woods on fire.

07:51.849 --> 07:54.371
Well, we got a call on this fire.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.492
We spotted the fire.

07:55.532 --> 07:56.533
The airplane found it.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.061
And it was raging.

07:58.121 --> 07:59.343
It was really going to town.

08:00.885 --> 08:10.697
And we had to send the biggest equipment that the forestry boys has got out on this particular job because it happened to be in a heavy, dense woods.

08:11.357 --> 08:15.082
And we got out there, and it was awful dry at this particular time.

08:15.142 --> 08:16.524
It was awful dry.

08:16.544 --> 08:18.446
And the woods was really burning.

08:18.466 --> 08:23.432
And you know how it is, friends, when it's real dry and been dry for several months or several weeks.

08:23.648 --> 08:28.195
Through the summer, you can take an old rotten, doughty chunk, and it'll burn for two or three weeks.

08:28.736 --> 08:29.437
I'll guarantee you.

08:29.497 --> 08:35.486
In fact, it'll just burn on and on and on until it rains and puts it out, or until it finally burns up.

08:35.986 --> 08:44.980
Well, what happened was we went on this fire, and we got out there, and all we could do was plow a fire lane around it and stop it from spreading or going any further.

08:45.340 --> 08:46.202
And that's what we did.

08:46.282 --> 08:49.466
We plowed a fire lane around it and stopped it.

08:49.927 --> 08:51.850
Well, we went back to investigate,

08:52.302 --> 08:54.324
to see where this fire originated.

08:54.885 --> 09:00.470
And that's where it come from, these three boys building a warming fire upside of this old dead tree.

09:01.191 --> 09:03.253
Well, that's not the end of that story, friends.

09:03.273 --> 09:04.314
It goes on and on.

09:05.335 --> 09:08.558
Do you know that, of course, we couldn't put the fire out?

09:08.959 --> 09:14.124
Why, it would have taken half of the water it was in the ocean, and there's no way for us to get it up there to put it out.

09:14.144 --> 09:18.348
All we could do, as I told you, is plow a fire laying around it and keep it from spreading.

09:19.049 --> 09:21.972
Well, several days later, a wind come up.

09:22.154 --> 09:23.216
and set a new fire.

09:23.676 --> 09:29.585
Well, we had to go back to this fire several times before it finally rained and put it out and stopped it.

09:30.226 --> 09:31.528
Well, that cost a lot of money.

09:31.628 --> 09:36.975
It cost the forestry boys lots of money, and it cost the taxpayers.

09:36.995 --> 09:38.397
It cost the landowners.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.842
It cost these boys that was making their living in the woods.

09:41.862 --> 09:47.971
It cost them because it injured the timber, and it just cost everybody.

09:48.192 --> 09:49.053
Everybody loses.

09:49.133 --> 09:50.575
When you have a fire in the woods,

09:50.892 --> 09:54.837
It don't make any difference who owns the land or who owns the timber.

09:55.718 --> 09:56.940
That's beside the point.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.241
Everybody loses.

09:58.342 --> 10:01.746
I lose, you lose, our kids lose, and everybody loses.

10:01.766 --> 10:02.507
You can't win.

10:03.488 --> 10:08.114
So that's one of the things that happens through carelessness.

10:08.715 --> 10:12.700
Now, these boys, they really thought they were doing the right thing.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.944
And in their own heart, they thought they was doing right.

10:15.984 --> 10:16.545
But you see,

10:16.964 --> 10:17.705
They didn't.

10:17.905 --> 10:19.366
They made one little mistake there.

10:19.466 --> 10:21.408
As Charlie was singing about, they made a mistake.

10:21.528 --> 10:24.051
They shouldn't have ever built that fire up against that dead tree.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.535
And I'll tell you, friends, it's a tough job fighting these fires.

10:28.875 --> 10:29.496
It really is.

10:29.696 --> 10:33.260
Now, on this particular fire, we lost between 600 and 800 acres.

10:33.820 --> 10:34.581
Now, imagine that.

10:35.242 --> 10:41.888
Just on account of one little mistake these loggers made where we lost between 600 and 800 acres.

10:41.908 --> 10:46.212
I say we because I'm just as much in it as anybody else, and you are too.

10:46.563 --> 10:47.884
So, friends, you got to think.

10:47.904 --> 10:48.225
Think.

10:48.245 --> 10:51.629
That's the thing that folks has got to do, is think.

10:51.649 --> 10:55.873
When fire burns, it's just like burning lots of dollar bills, because it's jobs.

10:56.414 --> 10:58.316
And let's be practical about it.

10:58.336 --> 10:59.237
Keep fire down.

10:59.658 --> 11:04.463
Here we go with the next tune, and I believe Herman's going to be featured on this tune with his little steel guitar.

11:04.883 --> 11:08.627
In fact, he's doing that old steel standard, the steel guitar rag.

11:08.988 --> 11:09.128
Herman?

11:11.150 --> 11:12.512
All more now.

11:12.532 --> 11:18.923
Pull it south.

11:19.424 --> 11:35.993
Ready, ready.

11:46.790 --> 11:53.053
Bye.

12:35.693 --> 12:41.201
Well, all right.

12:41.261 --> 12:41.942
Thank you, Herman.

12:41.962 --> 12:42.363
Thank you.

12:42.943 --> 12:45.127
I guess that old tune will never get old.

12:45.147 --> 12:46.509
This old steel guitar rag.

12:46.829 --> 12:48.892
Friends, we've run out of time and we've got to go now.

12:49.213 --> 12:52.037
We're going to pack up our stick horses and shove on.

12:52.097 --> 12:54.440
But I've got a thought here that I'd like to leave with you.

12:55.121 --> 12:57.845
And it's about a forest fire.

12:57.865 --> 13:00.269
It doesn't take much to start it.

13:00.289 --> 13:02.992
Some dry grass, a leaf, or a dry twig.

13:03.834 --> 13:04.755
One tiny spark.

13:05.191 --> 13:08.757
bit of a breeze, and the little fire grows big.

13:22.181 --> 13:24.765
Well, friends, we've certainly enjoyed this little visit with you.

13:25.086 --> 13:27.811
We hope that you'll come our way again sometime.

13:27.951 --> 13:30.355
The local announcer will let you know when we'll be back.

13:31.263 --> 13:43.703
Friends, don't forget that this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own State Forest Service and Uncle Sam's Forest Service with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

13:45.626 --> 13:50.454
Remember, friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

13:50.474 --> 13:50.554
Hey!

14:20.453 --> 14:31.847
Thank you.
