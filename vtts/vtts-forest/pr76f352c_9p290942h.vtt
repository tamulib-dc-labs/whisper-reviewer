00:34.523 --> 00:36.647
Well, howdy, friends.

00:36.727 --> 00:37.188
How y'all?

00:38.330 --> 00:41.035
I'm telling you, these boys all feeling good.

00:41.055 --> 00:43.720
Yeah, that's the carrying on around here in the hollering and shouting.

00:44.220 --> 00:44.902
That's your friends.

00:44.922 --> 00:47.526
This is Jelly Elliott and the three knotheads coming to you.

00:48.208 --> 00:51.754
Sitting here under the old pine tree, we're going to come in and play a few tunes for you.

00:51.794 --> 00:52.616
So don't go away.

00:52.656 --> 00:55.080
Drag up a chair there and make yourself comfortable.

00:55.887 --> 01:00.395
Relax, sir, and try to enjoy it, and we'll do our best to try to play it the way that you will enjoy it.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.661
We got some tunes lined up here for you, and here we are with the first one.

01:03.701 --> 01:05.966
Features our fiddle player, Jack.

01:05.986 --> 01:07.448
Yes, sir, Jack's got his fiddle.

01:08.170 --> 01:08.550
Got a new one.

01:08.571 --> 01:09.592
Yeah, got a new one.

01:09.813 --> 01:11.215
Got him a new one, 90 years old.

01:11.276 --> 01:12.458
Ain't full-grown, is it, Jack?

01:12.498 --> 01:14.081
Here he is with an old-timer.

01:14.121 --> 01:16.525
Now, all you old-timers will remember this one I know.

01:16.806 --> 01:19.110
The old hen cackle and the rooster lady...

01:26.684 --> 01:29.527
Uh-oh.

01:30.769 --> 01:42.862
That's your rooster.

01:43.863 --> 01:50.110
That's your under-fist dominance.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.866
Ha, ha, ha!

01:53.889 --> 02:00.252
How about you, baby?

02:04.062 --> 02:18.223
That's old Rhode Island red.

02:18.243 --> 02:19.846
Yeah.

02:19.886 --> 02:23.030
There's a bandie.

02:23.050 --> 02:27.156
Uh-oh, that dog gave me.

02:27.257 --> 02:27.577
Ho!

02:27.597 --> 02:32.164
That's good, Jack.

02:32.304 --> 02:32.905
Ho!

02:35.416 --> 02:54.278
Well, see, there it was, friends, from the bandit on up to the old dominecker.

02:54.298 --> 02:58.203
Yeah, we even had that underfed dominecker in there, didn't we?

02:58.223 --> 03:00.906
You know, excuse me.

03:00.926 --> 03:04.630
Friends, I just want you sportsmen out there, you fellas that hunt and fish,

03:05.318 --> 03:06.700
You're out in the woods occasionally.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.243
In fact, I guess you're out in the woods more often than anybody else.

03:11.084 --> 03:13.027
I just want to congratulate you, fellas.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.310
Yes, sir, I'm talking strictly to you.

03:16.330 --> 03:21.256
For the way that you've acted this year with your fires out in the woods.

03:21.276 --> 03:24.439
Your campfires and cigarettes and matches and things of that kind.

03:25.781 --> 03:27.843
Fellas, it's really dropped off considerably.

03:28.063 --> 03:34.971
I mean, the fires in the woods, the wood fires caused, man caused wood fires from hunters and fishermen, campfires and that sort of thing.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.944
Really dropped off this year, and I am proud of it.

03:38.964 --> 03:39.885
And I know you are.

03:40.425 --> 03:43.308
That's the reason why I was so anxious to pass it on to you.

03:43.328 --> 03:46.091
But it's nothing like perfect yet.

03:46.111 --> 03:47.513
We've got to have it even better.

03:48.073 --> 03:51.797
But you've really been swell, and my thanks goes out to you.

03:52.438 --> 03:54.901
We've just got to keep it up and do even a better job.

03:55.962 --> 04:00.547
But we need it all over the country, not only here but over there and everywhere.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.810
We need it for the wildlife, for the fishing.

04:05.090 --> 04:09.657
Fishing especially, because, I mean, the poor old fish, they're really mistreated.

04:09.677 --> 04:10.639
They've been mistreated.

04:10.719 --> 04:12.942
I know of one place in particular.

04:13.603 --> 04:19.532
A fellow bought a bunch of land, and he was going to make a farm out of it.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.497
And I know this man real well.

04:23.238 --> 04:32.312
And there was a creek run through his land that he bought there, and he went down, and naturally he wanted to clear off this creek bottom land because it was the richest.

04:33.170 --> 04:35.713
So he gets in there, and he cuts all the timber.

04:36.935 --> 04:40.259
Left this little bare creek running through the field.

04:40.820 --> 04:45.606
Friends, I used to fish in that little old creek before this man cut all this timber, and it was good fishing.

04:45.646 --> 04:48.390
You could go down and catch them good bull brim there.

04:48.450 --> 04:49.351
I mean, they were fine.

04:49.511 --> 04:49.952
Good eating.

04:50.412 --> 04:53.696
Now that good creek water there, and that's really fine eating.

04:54.537 --> 05:02.107
Believe it or not, friends, in about three years after he cleaned all the timber from around this little stream, there wasn't any fish.

05:02.127 --> 05:02.788
Right now,

05:03.140 --> 05:06.384
You can't find a minner in there.

05:06.404 --> 05:10.470
Well, he goes in there first and cuts all the timber down and sets it on fire.

05:10.490 --> 05:12.693
Of course, that's the quickest way he figured to get rid of it.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.415
So he did.

05:14.435 --> 05:14.936
Burned it up.

05:14.956 --> 05:15.396
What'd he do?

05:15.436 --> 05:17.219
He wound off all the fish.

05:17.239 --> 05:17.780
Well, it's bad.

05:17.820 --> 05:22.366
I got some more I want to tell you about that same thing here, but I guess we better do another tune here.

05:22.926 --> 05:25.410
And I believe Jack's going to come up and sing this next tune.

05:25.990 --> 05:29.555
Jack does a pretty good job on this tune sometimes.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.678
I hope this is one of the times that he does.

05:31.895 --> 05:33.492
Here he is with a nice tune.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.796
It's a sin to love you like I do.

05:41.378 --> 06:02.914
it's a sin to love you like i do dear oh why must i worry over you i love you too and i know that you have been untrue dear it's a sin to love you like i do

06:04.396 --> 06:26.168
When we met, you seemed so sweet and fair, dear I could not help love you from the start Oh, if I had only known back there, dear You would someday break my lonely heart

06:47.900 --> 07:16.945
It's a sin to love you like I do, dear Oh, if I could break love's change in two I would say a fun goodbye to you, dear It's a sin to love you like I do When we met, you seemed so sweet and fair, dear

07:17.532 --> 07:23.380
I could not help love you from the start.

07:23.400 --> 07:33.554
Oh, if I had only known back there, dear, you would someday break my lonely heart.

07:34.796 --> 07:36.518
Well, hello right there, Jack.

07:36.799 --> 07:37.480
Thank you, buddy.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.221
Thank you a lot.

07:38.261 --> 07:40.103
That was mighty fine carrying on there.

07:40.704 --> 07:44.950
You know, friends, we was talking about cleaning off the woods around a stream.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.392
I know of a particular place.

07:46.861 --> 07:49.184
I guess you people think I know a lot.

07:49.985 --> 07:51.807
Well, I do, because I stay in the woods.

07:51.867 --> 07:57.533
I mean, you get a chance, maybe, some of you, get a chance to go out in the woods maybe once a week, maybe once a year.

07:57.774 --> 07:58.875
But I stay out there.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.756
I'm there every day.

08:00.377 --> 08:03.060
And I see these things happening, and I'm interested in them.

08:03.540 --> 08:05.623
So naturally, I try to find out more about them.

08:06.083 --> 08:10.088
But I know of a case where a fellow was out squirrel hunting.

08:10.669 --> 08:11.029
And, uh,

08:11.465 --> 08:15.431
on the bank of a good fishing stream where the white perch was really biting good.

08:15.512 --> 08:18.156
I was catching them there myself, my wife and me.

08:18.176 --> 08:20.339
And there was a fellow come out there squirrel hunting.

08:20.359 --> 08:36.045
He was walking down the bank of this stream, and he heard something going... You ever hear anything go like that?

08:36.966 --> 08:37.888
Well, that's what he heard.

08:37.908 --> 08:38.569
That's a squirrel.

08:38.920 --> 08:41.043
In case any of you don't know what it is, that's what it was.

08:41.083 --> 08:42.124
It was a squirrel.

08:42.144 --> 08:45.429
So he went slipping down the bank of the lake there to get this squirrel.

08:46.230 --> 09:06.818
He saw the little old squirrel, and he was sitting up there in the tree right close to a hole, and he's going... You know, when they get up close to their hole and they see something that they're afraid of, they'll sit there right still, you know, and they'll look at you, and they'll go... You can scare him, just slap your hands on your pants out of the way, and he'll go...

09:07.304 --> 09:08.586
And in that hole, he's going.

09:08.846 --> 09:09.707
Well, that's what he done.

09:09.727 --> 09:11.309
He run in that hole.

09:11.329 --> 09:15.995
Well, this fellow, he looked the thing over there, and he decided, well, I got to have that squirrel.

09:16.055 --> 09:20.620
So first thing popped in his mind, smoke him out.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.403
So that's what he undertaken to do.

09:22.463 --> 09:28.991
He dug him up some leaves and sticks and vines and things there and built a fire in his hollow tree.

09:29.471 --> 09:34.037
Well, it created an awful smoke, and the smoke was just boiling out up the top of the tree there.

09:34.658 --> 09:38.882
Well, he never stopped to think the squirrel had more sense than he did.

09:38.902 --> 09:46.369
When the smoke got to going up through the tree and all, the little old squirrel slipped out the hole while he was bowed down there crumbling up leaves and things, crambling them into a hole at the bottom.

09:46.389 --> 09:50.013
The squirrel slipped out the hole up the top, went on off down through the wood.

09:51.294 --> 09:58.721
Well, he smoked and smoked, and he couldn't smoke him out, and he finally got disgusted with the whole works and decided he'd just go to the house and give it up.

09:58.741 --> 09:59.562
And that's what he done.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.003
He went off and left it.

10:01.456 --> 10:05.602
Well, fire got out there and burned off all up and down the lake there, friends.

10:05.662 --> 10:07.605
It just made it black.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.448
It was a bad fire.

10:09.468 --> 10:13.013
The forestry boys, they got on the job and finally got it stopped.

10:13.033 --> 10:15.477
But it's taken a lot of work, taken a lot of time.

10:16.238 --> 10:19.042
Sometime in the night before these boys got this fire out.

10:19.062 --> 10:20.705
Well, the man didn't get his squirrel.

10:21.426 --> 10:25.732
These ashes blew over in this stream, and they ruined the fishing.

10:26.253 --> 10:27.695
You couldn't catch a white perch there.

10:27.715 --> 10:30.079
For months after that, you couldn't catch no kind of fish.

10:30.481 --> 10:32.283
Friends, you know ashes make lye.

10:32.643 --> 10:35.106
Did any of you ever make any homemade hominy?

10:35.646 --> 10:36.968
You know how you make homemade hominy.

10:37.468 --> 10:48.940
Well, you take some oak ashes and put them in a sack or something, and you put you on a tub or pot or go out and get the wash pot, put you some corn in there and some water, and you get you a sack of ashes.

10:48.980 --> 10:57.689
And these ashes, they go through some kind of procedure there of lye or something that eats all the eyes and the skin off of that corn.

10:57.889 --> 10:59.931
You old-timed out there, you know what I'm talking about.

11:00.400 --> 11:05.705
Well, that's bound to be mighty powerful stuff to eat the skin off of a grain of corn and eat the eyes out of.

11:05.725 --> 11:07.106
What do you think it'll do to a fish?

11:08.207 --> 11:10.650
That makes sense, don't it?

11:10.710 --> 11:13.833
A lot of people never stop thinking about that, but that's a fact.

11:13.853 --> 11:14.213
It'll do it.

11:14.253 --> 11:15.374
Now, what do you think, them ashes?

11:15.394 --> 11:17.236
That's why we haven't got any fish.

11:17.256 --> 11:19.298
I mean, that's why we've got such a scarcity of them.

11:19.898 --> 11:22.061
People never stop to think about these things.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.902
Neighbors, we've got to be careful of these fires.

11:23.962 --> 11:26.665
If we don't, we're going to ruin our fishing, timber, we'll ruin everything.

11:27.986 --> 11:29.007
I know you'll help me, friend.

11:29.027 --> 11:29.968
Let's stop it.

11:30.235 --> 11:31.518
We'll just do that rare thing.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.379
Here's the next team.

11:33.381 --> 11:35.886
And it features Herman on his little steel guitar here.

11:36.528 --> 11:38.712
Herman's sitting over there just like a tree full of hoodowns.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.558
And here he goes with the Georgie steel rag.

11:43.642 --> 11:47.089
Oh, yeah, boy.

11:47.109 --> 11:47.670
Hi, mister.

12:36.166 --> 12:39.990
Herman, that's mighty fine steel playing there, buddy.

12:40.030 --> 12:41.511
You sure play a mess of steel.

12:41.551 --> 12:42.232
Thank you a lot.

12:43.293 --> 12:47.156
Well, friends, it looks like the old clock on the wall is about to catch up with us again.

12:47.537 --> 12:50.740
Yeah, it's still a-ticking and a-talking going around and around.

12:52.121 --> 12:53.983
We've enjoyed this visit here with you, though.

12:54.824 --> 13:04.233
Before we take off, neighbors, there's just one little thought here that I'd like to leave with you, and you can kind of toss it around there in your mind and think it over.

13:04.253 --> 13:05.734
You can take my word for it.

13:05.967 --> 13:11.974
You sportsmen out there that fire on the land and fish in the streams don't agree.

13:11.994 --> 13:30.996
So if you'll keep wildfire out of the woods, we'll have lots better fishing, you and me.

13:31.921 --> 13:33.624
Well, friends, there it is.

13:33.644 --> 13:38.211
Kind of brings to a close another little visit with you here on the old pine tree.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.779
We really have enjoyed it a whole lot, and we hope that you have.

13:42.799 --> 13:44.481
We'll be coming back your way, too.

13:45.163 --> 13:48.027
If you'll listen to the announcer, he'll let you know when we'll be back.

13:49.790 --> 13:59.025
And don't forget, neighbors, this program is made possible and brought to you with the best wishes and compliments from your own state forest service and Uncle Sam's forest service.

13:59.444 --> 14:02.151
with the cooperation of the station that you're now listening to.

14:03.796 --> 14:08.509
Remember friends, only you can prevent forest fires.

14:36.485 --> 14:39.930
Woo!
