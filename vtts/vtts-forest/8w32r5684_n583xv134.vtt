00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
[Silence.]

00:13.000 --> 00:26.000
[Music.]

00:26.000 --> 00:28.628
Talking by wire.

00:31.412 --> 00:31.813
Hello?

00:32.454 --> 00:35.000
This is the Texas Forest Service of A&M College calling...

00:35.000 --> 00:52.000
[Music.]

00:52.000 --> 00:58.709
75 years ago, Texans were without many of the conveniences of today.

00:58.729 --> 01:00.251
Motor cars were unknown.

01:00.752 --> 01:05.937
Airplanes, sound motion pictures, and radio broadcasting were almost undreamed of.

01:05.957 --> 01:08.660
And even the commoner facilities were missing.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.842
Take, for instance, communication.

01:11.260 --> 01:23.095
When the housewife wanted to order groceries, call a physician, or tell a choice bit of gossip to her friends, she must either send her young son down with a message or get ready for visiting and sally forth herself.

01:23.115 --> 01:30.824
Most business houses depended upon errand boys to carry orders, requests, and information to their customers and associates in the same town.

01:31.565 --> 01:37.633
And newspapers depended upon their reporters getting to the scene of news stories by foot or by horse.

01:37.653 --> 01:40.356
But some of the newspaper editors were not satisfied.

01:40.808 --> 01:52.624
One morning in the year 1876, in a newspaper office in Galveston, the two partners, Colonel Alfred H. Below and Willard Richardson, were just starting work for the day.

01:53.887 --> 01:58.854
Alfred, I see we've got a news story on this new invention by a man named Elisha Gray.

01:59.355 --> 02:01.758
That's what he calls the telephone, isn't it?

02:01.939 --> 02:04.863
Yes, we're running the article in today's paper.

02:04.903 --> 02:06.545
Gray's from Chicago, isn't he?

02:06.766 --> 02:07.507
So it says.

02:08.088 --> 02:15.138
I've read where Thomas Edison and a fellow named Bell have been working on the same thing, a way of talking over wires.

02:15.158 --> 02:17.401
I guess it isn't too far-fetched at that.

02:18.102 --> 02:22.088
A hundred years ago, who would have believed there would be such a thing as the telegraph?

02:22.675 --> 02:24.819
And now we're getting a chance to use it every day.

02:25.420 --> 02:30.390
Well, the wonderful discoveries of the last 50 years have almost prepared us to believe anything.

02:31.072 --> 02:38.667
But we must admit that we're being put to a strong test when we're called upon to believe that the sound of a human voice can be sent over the wires.

02:39.048 --> 02:41.292
Well, I don't know very much about electricity.

02:41.727 --> 02:50.017
but I'm willing to bet that someday we'll actually be able to talk into one of those instruments and make ourselves understood to anybody who owns one.

02:50.718 --> 02:52.821
I don't see any practical good out of it, though.

02:53.321 --> 02:54.963
We have telegraph lines now.

02:55.664 --> 03:00.650
If you want to send a message to another town, we run down to the telegraph office and give them the message.

03:01.191 --> 03:05.636
How much better off will we be if we hear the man talk when we get there?

03:05.656 --> 03:11.143
I grant you that it would be interesting to hear the man's voice, but I can't see any special advantage.

03:11.326 --> 03:14.371
But what if you didn't have to go down to the telegraph office?

03:15.192 --> 03:19.919
I'll wager that someday people will have this telephone in their own homes.

03:19.939 --> 03:22.883
You wouldn't need a telegraph operator to send the message for you.

03:22.904 --> 03:26.249
You'd just speak on the telephone to the person yourself.

03:26.269 --> 03:28.272
I don't see how it would work out.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.916
Think of how many wires you'd have to string up.

03:30.936 --> 03:34.000
You'd have to arrange for wires to everyone you wanted to talk to.

03:34.381 --> 03:39.088
I think they'll probably have some kind of an arrangement like they do now in telegraph stations.

03:39.912 --> 03:46.098
They could have a central point, but a wire to one person's house could be connected with the wire running to somebody else's house.

03:46.899 --> 03:52.625
Or if you wanted to talk to some other town, why the telephone people could connect you to the wire leading to the other town.

03:53.125 --> 03:57.930
Well, it may work, but I still think it's stretching the imagination a little.

03:57.950 --> 04:00.112
Think of what it would mean for the newspaper man.

04:00.773 --> 04:09.902
If I wanted to get the facts for a newspaper article, all I'd have to do would be to telephone the people concerned at their homes or business houses and verify the story.

04:10.490 --> 04:13.834
save sending a correspondent over to write the article.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.597
I can see all the money it would save us in time.

04:16.617 --> 04:19.860
Don't you think it would be too expensive for most people to afford?

04:20.281 --> 04:25.026
Well, if enough people would pay for the service, I should think it could be quite reasonable in price.

04:26.007 --> 04:30.912
I know that if they ever bring any telephones to Galveston, I'm going to have one put in my house.

04:30.932 --> 04:32.133
What about the telegraph?

04:32.634 --> 04:36.178
I'm just getting used to it now, and you're ready to tell me it's old-fashioned.

04:36.578 --> 04:40.142
I think the telegraph will become even more useful as time goes on.

04:40.544 --> 04:43.347
and I don't think the telephone will replace it.

04:43.367 --> 04:51.276
A telegraph will probably be more accurate, and especially for business firms, it'll be very useful, because they'll have a written record of the messages.

04:51.296 --> 04:56.963
But I think the telephone will be mighty handy around town, especially when you want to talk to somebody yourself.

04:57.323 --> 05:01.908
Well, I'm not such an old man yet, and I'm going to say we won't make any more progress.

05:02.589 --> 05:09.437
But if you ever get one of those things put in your house, and if I'm still around, I want to be the first person to talk to you.

05:16.403 --> 05:20.652
Annette, do you think you can spare me for a month or so?

05:21.013 --> 05:21.815
Why, Alfred?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.899
Do you plan on making a business trip?

05:24.260 --> 05:26.464
I've half a mind to go up to Philadelphia.

05:27.066 --> 05:33.700
They're having the centennial exposition up there, you know, and I think it'd be well if I went up to see what's going on in the world now.

05:33.980 --> 05:35.644
I think it would be nice if you went.

05:36.029 --> 05:38.191
Would you like another cup of coffee?

05:38.211 --> 05:38.972
Yes, please.

05:39.593 --> 05:45.499
You know, they've been sending us a lot of stories about some of the new inventions, and I'd like to see them myself.

05:45.519 --> 05:48.862
I believe a newspaper man should know a little something of what he's writing.

05:49.563 --> 05:50.784
You go along if you like.

05:51.145 --> 05:52.526
No, you go ahead and go.

05:53.127 --> 05:59.193
I have enough to do now to keep me busy, and I'll get a lot more done if you're out from under my feet for a while.

05:59.714 --> 06:04.078
But just don't stay away too long.

06:08.193 --> 06:11.389
Come on.

06:11.409 --> 06:11.571
Come on.

06:31.109 --> 06:33.753
Come in and get your fortune told, Madame Olga.

06:33.773 --> 06:37.078
We'll tell your past, present and future right this way, mister.

06:37.098 --> 06:40.344
Not just now, thanks.

06:40.444 --> 06:45.171
Get them while they're hot.

06:45.251 --> 06:46.914
Tender sweet corn on the cob.

06:47.234 --> 06:49.758
Guaranteed to get butter smeared from one ear to the other.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.000
Have one, mister?

06:51.341 --> 06:58.332
No, thank you.

06:59.037 --> 07:01.259
Under one of those shells is a small black pea.

07:01.280 --> 07:05.304
And to the lady or gentleman who tells me under which shell it is, I will give five silver dollars.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.146
I repeat, five silver dollars.

07:07.907 --> 07:09.289
How about you trying your luck, Spurt?

07:09.629 --> 07:10.149
No, thanks.

07:10.490 --> 07:13.153
But can you tell me where the telephone is being exhibited?

07:13.193 --> 07:14.374
Straight ahead on the left side.

07:14.715 --> 07:23.104
And now, ladies and gents, I repeat, if any of you can point out to me which one of these...

07:25.548 --> 07:30.778
You will see one of the marvels of the century, a demonstration of the telephone.

07:30.798 --> 07:34.344
You will actually see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears.

07:34.484 --> 07:35.967
I'd like a ticket, please.

07:35.987 --> 07:36.588
Oh, yes, sir.

07:36.648 --> 07:37.810
Here you are, mister.

07:37.830 --> 07:45.244
And another gentleman is just going in to witness the marvel of the century, a demonstration of the telephone on which you can actually talk.

07:49.932 --> 07:58.170
Thank you.

07:59.517 --> 08:00.939
Good morning, Mr. Below.

08:01.039 --> 08:01.499
You're next.

08:01.799 --> 08:02.640
Good morning, Lem.

08:03.001 --> 08:03.842
Shave as usual.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.043
Yes, sir, and a shave it is.

08:05.564 --> 08:08.327
I just now got through putting another cake of soap in your shaving mug.

08:08.347 --> 08:12.051
As I always try to keep all of my customers' mugs in apple pie order.

08:12.311 --> 08:12.851
Good enough.

08:13.312 --> 08:14.854
How's the family these days, Lem?

08:14.894 --> 08:15.895
Oh, fine, fine.

08:16.576 --> 08:18.798
Say, I heard you just now got back from Philadelphia.

08:19.018 --> 08:20.500
Yes, I got back yesterday.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.842
Must have been a mighty fine celebration they had up there, huh?

08:23.283 --> 08:25.305
Yes, I had a very pleasant time.

08:25.741 --> 08:28.326
I saw some new inventions that really took my eye.

08:28.666 --> 08:29.988
Lean right back there, Mr. Bielow.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.311
Ah, there you are.

08:32.152 --> 08:35.118
Somebody said you saw this here new telephone work up there.

08:35.338 --> 08:36.159
Yes, I did.

08:36.179 --> 08:41.068
I'm going to get one in my house as soon as I can so I can talk to the office.

08:41.088 --> 08:45.436
It'll probably be a year or two before I can get the material, but I'm going to have it.

08:45.456 --> 08:46.197
Ah, you don't mean it.

08:46.548 --> 08:48.792
Well, I can't understand how in the world it can work.

08:49.093 --> 08:52.619
They say all you have to do is run some wire, like in the telegraph, and you can talk.

08:52.920 --> 08:53.401
Is that right?

08:53.561 --> 08:54.182
That's right.

08:54.422 --> 08:58.189
And what I can't understand is how they're going to run wires all around to carry the talking.

08:59.311 --> 09:02.437
I'll bet it'll take a million wood poles to carry those wires all over.

09:03.379 --> 09:04.641
Don't sound practical to me.

09:04.621 --> 09:08.666
Well, I think we have all the timber we need in East Texas proposed.

09:08.686 --> 09:09.747
Maybe so, maybe so.

09:10.228 --> 09:16.716
Of course, I don't mean to argue with you, but I doubt if I ever live to see the day when you can talk to anybody around without ever going out of your house.

09:16.836 --> 09:28.350
Well, I'm not going to argue with you either, as long as you've got that razor in your hand.

09:29.005 --> 09:32.450
How long will it be before we can try out this telephone, Alfred?

09:32.590 --> 09:37.097
It should be just a few minutes, as soon as these men get through connecting up the wires outside.

09:37.498 --> 09:38.459
How do you make it work?

09:38.880 --> 09:39.981
Do you think I can do it?

09:40.102 --> 09:42.085
Why, there's nothing to it, Nettie.

09:42.105 --> 09:44.288
All you have to do is crank this little knob.

09:44.628 --> 09:46.932
It makes the bell ring on the other end.

09:46.952 --> 09:52.560
Then you just lift up this little thing, oh, by the way, it's called a receiver, and talk into the mouthpiece.

09:53.081 --> 09:56.987
Then you put the receiver against your ear, and you hear the other person talk.

09:57.119 --> 10:00.183
Is the mayor going to be down to the newspaper office to try it out?

10:00.383 --> 10:02.125
Yes, he said he wanted to talk over it.

10:02.505 --> 10:05.929
I understand there are going to be quite a few other people down there, too.

10:05.949 --> 10:08.653
But the one I want to talk to is Will Richardson.

10:09.173 --> 10:18.244
A couple of years ago, before I went to the Centennial in Philadelphia, he said that if I ever got one of these things in my house, he wanted to be the first to talk to me.

10:18.264 --> 10:24.932
You know, Alfred, I was just thinking, if some of the other women around here had telephones in their houses...

10:25.351 --> 10:30.899
I could talk to them as long as I wanted without ever having to get dressed up for visiting.

10:31.380 --> 10:36.087
I can see where the telephone is going to be very popular with the women folks.

10:37.249 --> 10:38.771
It's all ready to go, Colonel.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.334
We have the wires connected.

10:40.694 --> 10:42.798
Well, here we go, Nettie, and I hope it works.

10:43.398 --> 10:45.702
I hate to think what Richardson's going to say if it doesn't.

10:48.466 --> 10:48.867
Hello?

10:49.688 --> 10:50.069
Hello?

10:52.092 --> 10:53.253
Oh, nobody answers.

10:53.273 --> 10:54.295
I'll try ringing again.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.382
Just a minute there, Colonel.

10:57.402 --> 10:58.863
This wire's come loose again.

10:58.923 --> 11:00.305
We'll have it fixed in a jiffy.

11:00.625 --> 11:01.025
All right.

11:01.826 --> 11:03.108
I hope they get it working this time.

11:03.208 --> 11:04.429
Patience, Alfred.

11:04.889 --> 11:06.871
I'm sure they'll get it ready right away.

11:07.352 --> 11:08.293
All ready, Colonel.

11:08.313 --> 11:09.774
Be low, but try it now.

11:10.115 --> 11:13.558
All right.

11:13.578 --> 11:13.959
Hello?

11:14.559 --> 11:14.920
Hello?

11:16.461 --> 11:16.802
Hello?

11:17.542 --> 11:18.583
Is that you, Richardson?

11:19.444 --> 11:19.885
What's that?

11:20.065 --> 11:20.926
What does he say?

11:21.466 --> 11:23.508
He says I'm hollering too loud in his ear.

11:24.189 --> 11:24.990
Hello, Richardson.

11:25.527 --> 11:29.112
What do you think of the invention now?

11:29.132 --> 11:30.133
Pretty good, isn't it?

11:31.655 --> 11:36.922
Yes, and I'll bet it isn't long until every newspaper in the country will have one.

11:36.942 --> 11:38.144
That's what I said.

11:38.164 --> 11:38.585
Alfred.

11:39.426 --> 11:40.727
Just a second, Richardson.

11:41.088 --> 11:42.189
Hold on for a second.

11:42.850 --> 11:45.374
My wife wants to ask me something.

11:45.394 --> 11:46.015
What is it, Nettie?

11:46.275 --> 11:47.717
It just came to me, Alfred.

11:48.358 --> 11:53.104
Now I can call you home when it's time for supper.

12:01.994 --> 12:11.070
This was the story of the first telephone line in Texas.

12:11.090 --> 12:16.459
In the year 1878, Colonel Alfred H. Below made the first telephone call in the state.

12:16.962 --> 12:23.151
Credit for the invention of the telephone was finally given to Alexander Graham Bell, whose first patents date from 1876.

12:24.452 --> 12:30.060
But the pioneering work of Elisha Gray, Thomas A. Edison, and others is recognized.

12:30.080 --> 12:40.995
The first telephone exchange in Texas was opened in Galveston on August 21, 1879, and the first long-distance line was between Galveston and Houston in 1883.

12:41.600 --> 12:47.674
Today, there are more than a thousand telephone exchanges in the state with nearly a million telephones.

12:47.694 --> 12:50.079
Telephone lines use a lot of telephone poles.

12:50.680 --> 13:00.823
Millions of telephone poles produced in East Texas go into the state's extensive telephone system, helping to carry the messages which binds the state so closely together.

13:01.208 --> 13:05.854
These telephone poles are an important source of income to East Texas timberland owners.

13:06.475 --> 13:08.838
Poles bring a high price on the market.

13:08.858 --> 13:15.227
Timberland owners who selectively cut pole material from their pine stands usually make money from their timber crop.

13:15.888 --> 13:25.641
By practicing good forestry, they can keep their timberlands continually producing timber for the industries of the state.

13:28.204 --> 13:30.287
Music

13:31.938 --> 13:47.436
A constant supply of timber can build a greater Texas.

13:47.456 --> 13:52.862
This transcription has been brought to you by the Texas Forest Service of A&M College, W.E.

13:52.922 --> 13:58.789
White director, as a part of the public service activities of the radio station to which you are listening.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.599
Your announcer is Brits Cooler.

14:01.180 --> 14:03.545
