00:09.060 --> 00:13.120
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.060 --> 00:34.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.880
And here are your hosts.

00:43.580 --> 00:44.840
This is David Cruz.

00:45.120 --> 00:45.720
And Daryl Lane.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.400
One of the most honored and respected of today's science fiction authors is the English writer

00:50.400 --> 00:51.320
Brian Aldis.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.240
His first science fiction story was published in 1954, and since then he's won every award

00:56.240 --> 00:58.840
the field has to offer, both in this country and throughout Europe.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.260
Aldis is a craftsman of the highest order.

01:01.560 --> 01:06.140
The attention he gives to style, character and structure demonstrates the literary polish

01:06.140 --> 01:09.040
that often distinguishes British science fiction from American.

01:09.460 --> 01:13.060
He's written a few non-science fiction novels, in fact, that have been bestsellers in England.

01:13.780 --> 01:17.320
We asked him why he chose to concentrate his career in science fiction rather than mainstream

01:17.320 --> 01:17.820
literature.

01:18.880 --> 01:25.220
Well, I regard myself as a writer, and this difference that seems to be so apparent to

01:25.220 --> 01:27.680
other people is not so apparent to me.

01:29.080 --> 01:35.920
I'm interested in a kind of literature of ideas, and sometimes that strays to one side

01:35.920 --> 01:38.840
of the science fiction fence, and sometimes to another.

01:40.540 --> 01:45.960
But it's not as though one day I'm riding a horse and the next day I'm riding a cow.

01:47.240 --> 01:55.880
It's just that I'm in the same vehicle all the time, but sometimes the identification

01:55.880 --> 01:56.980
marks change.

01:58.060 --> 01:59.540
That's the way I see it.

02:00.620 --> 02:05.000
In some of his personal essays on science fiction, Aldis tells of how he was introduced

02:05.000 --> 02:09.140
to the field as a child through Lurid pulp magazines he found at Woolworth's.

02:09.660 --> 02:13.920
His family disapproved of his reading such literature, but Aldis was fascinated and wouldn't

02:13.920 --> 02:14.420
give it up.

02:14.740 --> 02:17.520
He explains why he was so drawn to science fiction at an early age.

02:18.360 --> 02:25.960
I believe it was really that I never had a firm conviction as a child that the world

02:25.960 --> 02:29.040
was, as all the grown-ups claimed it to be.

02:29.980 --> 02:37.060
It seemed to me that it was a much more interesting place than any of them believed, or that they

02:37.060 --> 02:39.960
sought to deny it was an interesting place at all.

02:40.480 --> 02:46.620
They were all busy working in their shops and making their money and leading their routine

02:46.620 --> 02:47.240
lives.

02:48.560 --> 02:56.200
I was a bit of a scapeologist when I was a child.

02:57.400 --> 03:06.320
I picked up a phrase from an old cowboy movie where one of the wrestlers says out of the

03:06.320 --> 03:11.020
corner of his mouth, let's go while the gogings good.

03:12.280 --> 03:19.800
And that became a kind of motto for me and at the age of four I was the hottest wrestler

03:19.800 --> 03:24.700
in East Deer of Norfolk and I used to go while the going was good.

03:26.360 --> 03:32.780
So I had that streak of wildness in me I suppose you could say.

03:34.120 --> 03:38.760
Aldis' streak of wildness later led to unique experiments in some of his science fiction

03:38.760 --> 03:39.200
novels.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.660
He gained a reputation as an innovator, as a science fiction author who wasn't afraid

03:43.660 --> 03:47.440
to introduce new styles and concepts into a fairly traditional field.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.380
Two good examples of his innovative techniques were the novels report on probability A in

03:52.380 --> 03:54.880
Barefoot in the Head, published in the late 60s.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.980
Their complex styles were avant-garde and confusing to many science fiction readers.

03:59.540 --> 04:04.000
We asked Aldis if he deliberately sought to open up science fiction or enlarge its boundaries

04:04.000 --> 04:05.080
with such experiments.

04:06.260 --> 04:12.080
Would you understand that it's not exactly a motive in writing to expand the field?

04:13.540 --> 04:21.460
I think what you think you're doing at the time is trying to find a little, how should

04:21.460 --> 04:22.380
we mix the metaphor?

04:22.800 --> 04:29.920
Trying to find a little breathing space where the ground isn't too trampled already by the

04:29.920 --> 04:31.280
hordes of other writers.

04:32.880 --> 04:43.660
So you seek out, I suppose, the perimeters of the field as it's currently defined.

04:44.900 --> 04:51.200
And in that way if you accidentally extend it well, that's very nice.

04:52.160 --> 04:56.940
And of course some people are grateful to you and other people are very cross with you for

04:56.940 --> 04:58.860
doing it because they say you're breaking the rules.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.280
Next time we'll talk with Brian Aldis about some of his works.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:13.900 --> 05:18.240
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:57.640 --> 05:58.120
Thank you.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:19.820 --> 06:25.260
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.660
And here are your hosts.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.400
This is Daryl Lane.

06:35.660 --> 06:36.380
And David Cruz.

06:36.880 --> 06:41.360
In 1973, Brian Aldis published a book on the origin and history of science fiction entitled

06:41.360 --> 06:42.440
Billion Years Spree.

06:42.900 --> 06:46.600
He gave us an interesting account of the reasons he wrote the book, including some comments

06:46.600 --> 06:48.700
on one of his novels, Barefoot in the Head.

06:49.560 --> 06:56.420
Well, I'd written a novel called Barefoot in the Head and it really didn't receive

06:57.400 --> 07:01.700
very kind initial attention, although the premise was simple enough.

07:03.040 --> 07:08.220
Barefoot in the Head was about the world stopped in its tracks by drugs.

07:08.520 --> 07:16.260
This was the late 60s, remember, when the Flower Power people had been around and we

07:16.260 --> 07:27.060
had had all this love in stuff and towards the end of the 60s the bills, as we say in

07:27.060 --> 07:32.640
England, the checks were coming in for all that kind of stuff and they were already finding

07:32.640 --> 07:38.960
the foetuses in the trash cans of Heat Ashbury so that Barefoot in the Head was an ambivalent

07:38.960 --> 07:40.740
book written in a difficult language.

07:41.180 --> 07:47.040
But I poured into it all I knew about A, science fiction and B, writing.

07:49.820 --> 07:58.340
I was a little surprised at the tepid response it got, the angry response it got, the anonymous

07:58.340 --> 07:58.800
letters.

07:59.060 --> 08:02.420
So I thought, well, let's me finish with the science fiction field.

08:03.780 --> 08:09.540
And I thought, well, before I leave it I ought to write down all that I know and love

08:09.540 --> 08:12.960
about it before I forget.

08:14.220 --> 08:19.300
And so really I settled down with that in mind to write Billionaire Spree and also to have

08:19.300 --> 08:24.820
an argument as I raised my hat and left the science fiction or community.

08:26.500 --> 08:34.300
But by the time I got to the end of the thing, you know, three years had passed and just

08:34.300 --> 08:37.120
writing the book turned me on to science fiction again.

08:38.060 --> 08:41.440
Billionaire Spree is full of Aldous's personal but fascinating ideas.

08:42.040 --> 08:46.920
One provocative idea, heresy to some science fiction fans, was that Hugo Gernsback, the

08:46.920 --> 08:50.140
father of modern science fiction, was a disastrous influence on the field.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.240
We asked Aldous what he meant by that.

08:52.940 --> 08:59.040
Well, as you probably know, that I did say something of that sort and since then people

08:59.040 --> 09:04.140
have been threatening to break my legs and my arms and shoot me and hang me and kick

09:04.140 --> 09:07.680
me out of the science fiction field and all sorts of things like that.

09:08.540 --> 09:21.100
But I guess that what I was worried about was the way science fiction was segregated

09:21.680 --> 09:34.120
by Gernsback into a magazine so that if you wanted to find science fiction you had to

09:34.120 --> 09:42.880
make a astounding or amazing or staggering which had a huge three-dimensional title with

09:42.880 --> 09:53.060
rivets in it and that resulted in a mono culture and we all know that there are dangers in

09:53.060 --> 09:54.080
mono culture.

09:55.240 --> 10:03.180
And I simply thought that the science fiction would be better as an uncaged animal that

10:03.180 --> 10:05.940
could rove at large where it would.

10:07.600 --> 10:15.160
But nowadays people complain that science fiction is segregated and that people think you're

10:15.160 --> 10:21.180
funny if you read it and that it has to have a special place in a bookshop right next to

10:21.180 --> 10:25.080
weirdo cult books about flying saucers or whatever.

10:25.920 --> 10:31.080
Well my answer to that is that yes, I agree, I think that's too bad.

10:31.080 --> 10:37.120
I think science fiction is much better than that but the reason why it is there is because

10:37.120 --> 10:40.980
of the segregation that was introduced by Hugo Gernsback.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.760
That was my argument.

10:43.940 --> 10:48.140
Anyone seeking to gain a perspective on science fiction and fantasy should read Billion Year's

10:48.140 --> 10:52.280
Spree, a personal but fascinating account of the field by one of science fiction's true

10:52.280 --> 10:52.840
men of letters.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.120
Tomorrow more with Brian Aldis.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.940
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

11:06.940 --> 11:11.260
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:53.360 --> 11:57.340
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:13.460 --> 12:18.920
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.340
And here are your hosts.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.860
This is David Cruz.

12:30.200 --> 12:30.780
And Darrell Ang.

12:31.180 --> 12:35.220
Brian Aldis does unexpected but fascinating things in his science fiction stories.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.760
Though Aldis is often an innovator, he also understands and cherishes the traditions of

12:39.760 --> 12:40.380
science fiction.

12:40.820 --> 12:45.320
Aldis has demonstrated his fondness for science fiction's past by redoing some of its classic

12:45.320 --> 12:45.720
novels.

12:46.200 --> 12:50.740
An island called Moro, for instance, was based on H. D. Wells, the island of Dr. Moro.

12:50.740 --> 12:55.540
In his book, Frankenstein Unbound, drew on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, published in 1818,

12:55.980 --> 12:57.800
which some call a first science fiction novel.

12:58.320 --> 13:02.160
Aldis relates the impulse behind his writing of Frankenstein Unbound.

13:03.360 --> 13:10.380
I think that I write about the things that fascinate me most, and I'm kind of a literary

13:10.380 --> 13:18.100
man, and I certainly much admire Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

13:18.100 --> 13:24.720
It's the most remarkable work for anyone, at least for a young lady, not quite touching

13:24.720 --> 13:25.200
18.

13:26.580 --> 13:35.940
And when I had the impulse to write Frankenstein Unbound, it was really an exegetical impulse

13:36.920 --> 13:48.080
to draw everybody's attention, if possible, to the excellence of that original novel, which,

13:48.080 --> 13:54.640
rather than pilloried by the filmmakers, who've seen nothing better in it than a stupid,

13:54.820 --> 13:57.580
shambling and inarticulate monster.

13:58.380 --> 14:09.700
I wanted to restore the monster to his true evil power as an articulate feeling and maimed

14:09.700 --> 14:16.140
by the being worthy of our compassion and perhaps our hatred.

14:17.740 --> 14:22.520
Aldis says there was a true creative impulse behind Frankenstein Unbound, but that wasn't

14:22.520 --> 14:23.800
so for an island called Moro.

14:24.860 --> 14:33.980
I have to admit that later on I did the same thing with Wells' Island of Dr. Moro, and

14:33.980 --> 14:37.360
that was, I believe, an advice.

14:38.180 --> 14:48.120
It's one of the few novels I've written that didn't begin with some kind of genuine lust

14:48.120 --> 14:54.480
to create, will to create, with fire in my stomach.

14:55.600 --> 15:00.200
I just thought it was something I could do, and that was too tiny a motive, I believe,

15:00.300 --> 15:02.200
for the book that I eventually turned out.

15:02.900 --> 15:11.220
I don't believe that it supersedes or in any way aids the Wells' version.

15:12.060 --> 15:19.000
The funny thing is, I have to say, that that novel was extremely well received in this country

15:19.000 --> 15:20.240
and in Great Britain.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.520
Another Aldis tribute to science fiction's past is his novella, The Saliva Tree.

15:25.860 --> 15:30.740
It's a playful book, a clever tribute to H.G. Wells, who happens to be an unseen character in it.

15:30.740 --> 15:35.300
It's about an invisible alien monster ravaging the countryside of late Victorian England.

15:35.740 --> 15:40.340
Invading monsters and invisibility are two of Wells' themes, of course, and during the story,

15:40.480 --> 15:43.840
all of Wells' themes and the titles of his books are somehow worked in.

15:44.480 --> 15:49.680
The story's main character, Gregory Rolls, has been writing letters to H.G. Wells about the happenings in the countryside.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.500
Wells comes to meet Rolls as the story ends.

15:53.500 --> 16:03.680
Our central character is about to relate to H.G. Wells the horrific events that have gone on down on the farm.

16:05.120 --> 16:14.580
And in those events are really the germs for all of Wells' science fiction.

16:15.760 --> 16:22.620
I mean, you know, there's a kind of a joke on H.G. Wells there.

16:22.900 --> 16:30.540
I mean, we all owe a great debt to H.G. Wells because he preempted almost all of the science fiction themes.

16:31.360 --> 16:37.460
And so in a way, The Saliva Tree is a kind of horrific joke to show that in fact,

16:37.460 --> 16:44.880
Wells didn't have any original ideas. They were all given to him by this guy who knocks on the door at the end of the story.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.480
More on the works of Brian Aldis next time.

16:55.640 --> 17:01.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

17:01.140 --> 17:04.440
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:07.460 --> 17:37.440
The show is about the story of a man who was born in the United States in the United States.

17:50.900 --> 17:54.860
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:11.120 --> 18:16.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.920
And here are your hosts.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.700
This is Daryl Lane.

18:26.940 --> 18:27.660
And David Cruz.

18:28.160 --> 18:32.440
English science fiction author Brian Aldis sometimes writes books which are difficult to categorize.

18:32.440 --> 18:39.360
Aldis has written familiar science fiction such as his first novel, which was published in this country in 1959 as Starship.

18:39.860 --> 18:43.240
But many of his novels are experimental or avant-garde in both theme and structure.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.480
Report and Probability A published in 1969 is a good example of this type.

18:48.040 --> 18:55.100
A 1976 novel, though, The Melasia Tapestry, is one of his most unique novels, a strange but richly rewarding book.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.000
And it completely resists categories.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.900
It could be called science fiction, but it's not quite that.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.540
Some might say it's fantasy, but it's not that either.

19:02.820 --> 19:05.480
Aldis talks about the inspiration behind the book.

19:06.440 --> 19:12.120
The model I had was a pictorial one.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.320
That's often the case.

19:15.240 --> 19:22.080
Well, in several of my novels, I start from a pictorial beginning.

19:23.080 --> 19:37.040
And my pictorial beginnings with Melasia were the etchings which the Italian artist, the Baroque artist, G.B.T. Epileaux, made at the end of his life.

19:37.990 --> 19:52.880
Towards the end of his life, he retired and he started etching these mysterious little pictures of wizards,

19:52.880 --> 20:08.940
Monte Banks, soldiers, punchinellos, people being dug out of the ground from graves, owls, serpents burning on altars,

20:09.380 --> 20:12.820
all sorts of mysterious symbols in these lovely little pictures.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.880
And no one's actually figured out what they meant to be.

20:15.880 --> 20:25.160
It's like a science fictional alternative world where magic rules, I suppose you'd say,

20:26.040 --> 20:29.160
and I suppose that was one of the things I liked about them.

20:30.240 --> 20:38.700
So I thought, well, if no one else can reconstruct this world to their satisfaction, I'll have a go at it.

20:39.960 --> 20:48.700
And so I started writing short stories around the more haunting of these etchings of T.E.E.P.E.L.O.S.

20:49.680 --> 20:55.780
Melasia itself is a grand city which exists in what appears to be an alternate universe, suggestive of Earth's ancient past.

20:56.180 --> 20:59.840
There is no technology to speak of, sorcery of a limited sort seems to work,

21:00.160 --> 21:04.020
and there are all manner of exotic creatures such as flying beings which resemble humans.

21:04.020 --> 21:08.800
The novel's main concern is art, an unusual theme for a science fiction or fantasy book,

21:09.060 --> 21:11.060
seemingly more appropriate for a romantic poet.

21:11.500 --> 21:15.720
Aldous told us that the theme of art came out of a serious illness he had while writing the book.

21:16.740 --> 21:21.620
The effect of this internal complaint I had, this hepatitis,

21:25.400 --> 21:30.320
made me feel that, well, my lifespan was limited,

21:31.120 --> 21:37.900
and I'd frolicked about a good deal and had written some books that I perhaps didn't take as seriously as I should do,

21:39.280 --> 21:45.820
and that what I dearly loved was writing, and that I wanted to make a statement about art.

21:48.320 --> 21:53.020
And really, Melasia is, it's all about art from the title onwards.

21:53.020 --> 22:04.340
In other words, if the book has a power, it is the power of meditations on the nature of art,

22:04.600 --> 22:10.960
which is at once to transfigure, and at the same time to petrify.

22:10.960 --> 22:20.920
And as you know, Melasia itself is a city-state under a curse of zero change.

22:22.260 --> 22:26.500
Well, that's like a work of art, it's like Tia Pello's little etchings.

22:27.320 --> 22:32.740
They may be forever enigmatic to us, but they're forever unchanging.

22:33.560 --> 22:37.320
The Melasia Tapestry by one of the masters of modern science fiction,

22:37.320 --> 22:40.640
a difficult novel to categorize but a fascinating one to read.

22:41.020 --> 22:43.320
More with author Brian Aldous on our next show.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:53.300 --> 22:56.020
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:56.020 --> 22:59.260
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:41.980 --> 23:46.160
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:02.260 --> 24:04.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

24:04.820 --> 24:07.720
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.140
And here are your hosts.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.380
This is David Cruz.

24:18.640 --> 24:19.240
And Daryl Lane.

24:19.700 --> 24:23.160
Brian Aldous' latest science fiction novel is the masterful achievement

24:23.160 --> 24:25.840
of an author who is at the height of his very awesome powers.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.480
It's called Heliconia Spring, and it's the first volume of a trilogy

24:29.480 --> 24:31.460
about an earth-like planet called Heliconia.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.140
Aldous tells us about the planet and the books.

24:35.640 --> 24:40.720
Heliconia is the name of a planet that's really much like Earth,

24:41.060 --> 24:43.900
and a lot of earth-like things go on there.

24:44.900 --> 24:51.040
But it is the child of binary suns,

24:51.080 --> 24:57.780
and it takes two and a half thousand years to go around the primary.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.160
I mean two and a half thousand Earth years.

25:04.840 --> 25:09.760
Which is to say that between one winter and the next,

25:10.820 --> 25:17.180
you can have a whole lot of civilizations doing a whole lot of declining and falling,

25:18.480 --> 25:21.380
and of course, falling and rising.

25:22.460 --> 25:32.520
And so that these three long volumes really just cover parts of one of Heliconia's great years.

25:33.520 --> 25:41.720
So there's at once this marvellous continuity, as I see it, of one year,

25:42.740 --> 25:45.900
and yet of many generations and many cultures.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.360
And that's the basic plan of the book.

25:50.840 --> 25:54.000
They're simply titled, The First One's Heliconia Spring.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.180
That's the one that's out.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.620
The one I'm writing is Heliconia Summer.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.380
And after that, I go on to Heliconia Winter.

26:03.820 --> 26:07.280
After centuries of a deadening winter, spring is coming to Heliconia,

26:07.660 --> 26:11.300
and the primitive men of the planet are waking up to the greater possibilities of life,

26:11.720 --> 26:15.600
to higher aspirations and knowledge, to the construction of a new civilization.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.660
The first volume traces the life of a nomadic hunter named Uli and his descendants.

26:21.540 --> 26:24.780
Because the first volume is about the sun bursting out.

26:25.940 --> 26:30.480
The first volume is just stacked full of things bursting out,

26:30.900 --> 26:34.260
and people bursting out, animals bursting out.

26:35.580 --> 26:37.680
It's a great bursting out novel.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.960
Circling Heliconia is a satellite from Earth,

26:48.360 --> 26:53.000
a huge observation station which monitors everything that happens in Heliconia and beams it to Earth.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.140
Aldous spent a painstaking four years on the book, striving for accuracy and realism.

26:59.300 --> 27:04.100
Well, I hope people will find that it's full of reality.

27:04.860 --> 27:08.680
That's why I say the moral of it should be mere existence,

27:09.100 --> 27:14.260
because I think they recognize their own lives passing through the book.

27:15.580 --> 27:22.900
And the other motive I had was that I grew rather alarm

27:22.900 --> 27:30.320
that the way so much science fiction, since it's become more popular,

27:31.400 --> 27:37.420
has been full of, what shall we say, fantasy, wish fulfillment.

27:38.480 --> 27:46.920
I didn't like that. I think that science fiction should reflect the facts of life,

27:48.120 --> 27:50.380
the hard facts of life.

27:51.020 --> 27:57.960
It shouldn't just be some nonsense about one guy against a malign empire

27:57.960 --> 28:02.600
who goes out and kills the chief baddie.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.520
I thought it should have a little more contact for reality.

28:07.300 --> 28:11.020
And moreover, I'll sound old fashioned if I say this,

28:11.020 --> 28:16.480
but I think that sort of thing is better for the nation's youth

28:17.020 --> 28:23.140
than the old hogwash about telepathic dragons and all the rest of it.

28:29.580 --> 28:32.140
Heliconia Spring is a remarkable and unique achievement

28:32.140 --> 28:34.540
by a man who is not just a great science fiction writer,

28:34.820 --> 28:36.600
but one of the finest writers of our time.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:46.920 --> 28:49.300
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:49.640 --> 28:52.960
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:11.020 --> 29:15.620
Thank you.
