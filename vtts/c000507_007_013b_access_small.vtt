WEBVTT

00:01.900 --> 00:04.920
All glass line of graphics handles is my work.

00:06.180 --> 00:10.980
But that's enough to keep Audrey quite busy.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.820
But that's what it's all about.

00:17.900 --> 00:18.420
Okay.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.380
Don't ask me.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.160
The title comes from a song by The Beatles, if you don't know that.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.400
We always get funny responses when we make phone orders to our wholesalers or whatever.

00:28.400 --> 00:33.260
If somebody hasn't heard the name of the company, we always have to spell it out.

00:34.820 --> 00:38.620
I chose the G.O. just because I like the way the letter forms go together.

00:39.780 --> 00:42.620
So our logo is a G and an O that are intertwined.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.060
What's on your ring?

00:44.600 --> 00:48.000
Well this ring is my single, my signature.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.720
It's almost a brand.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.460
It's a combination of a W and an M put together.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.020
Originally it was more calligraphic and feeling.

00:57.020 --> 00:59.380
It was the flowing M and a W combined.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.200
And as I got into doing more and more science fiction, the edges on my signature got harder

01:04.200 --> 01:04.600
and harder.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.300
Now it's more of a hard edge type of thing.

01:09.380 --> 01:10.780
Who knows, maybe it'll change in the future.

01:11.140 --> 01:17.320
I had someone tell me by the way that my paintings wouldn't be worth much because I didn't sign

01:17.320 --> 01:21.140
them with my full name that I used this signature that was like a brand.

01:21.140 --> 01:26.780
And for three paintings, four paintings, I signed my name full out.

01:27.000 --> 01:27.980
I signed it Waylon.

01:28.980 --> 01:33.480
And that was the White Dragon, the other two Dragon books I did for Amicafry and a book

01:33.480 --> 01:34.280
by Paul Anderson.

01:35.100 --> 01:38.880
But after doing those, it just didn't feel right to sign my name.

01:39.060 --> 01:40.820
It just wasn't my signature to me.

01:40.880 --> 01:46.440
So I went back to using this MW in a circle and that's the way it's going to stay no

01:46.440 --> 01:47.680
matter what anybody says I guess.

01:49.380 --> 01:50.440
Definitely your prior?

01:50.440 --> 01:51.000
Yeah.

01:52.280 --> 01:56.020
Yeah, well I found it has made a bit of difference really in terms of sales of my artwork.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.580
So I shouldn't have listened to that person's advice.

02:01.340 --> 02:03.080
Let's go ahead and move on down.

02:05.080 --> 02:05.440
Okay.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.420
Yeah, let's start with Arthur's work.

02:10.860 --> 02:14.000
How did you get contacted to do this particular one?

02:15.460 --> 02:16.440
They just called me up.

02:16.740 --> 02:17.400
They wanted to do it.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.640
I said, sure.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.220
I'm a real fan of 2001.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.560
That's probably my favorite movie of all time.

02:26.920 --> 02:31.780
And so I really wanted to do the cover to that particular book.

02:32.000 --> 02:40.480
But the problem is they weren't sure how they wanted to try to sort of present the book

02:40.480 --> 02:42.120
to the public.

02:42.340 --> 02:45.400
So I did probably 12 concepts for that cover.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.720
And I was equally disposed to all the different ways of approaching it.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.460
And they chose this one.

02:52.580 --> 02:57.140
Originally I thought of composing it so that the spaceship looked like a baby's rattle

02:57.580 --> 02:59.020
in the hands of the baby.

02:59.100 --> 02:59.900
But they didn't go for that.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.500
They wanted a more front and center.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.800
So there it is.

03:04.980 --> 03:08.960
But I probably would have chosen not to have the spaceship in the painting at all and

03:08.960 --> 03:10.760
to amplify this concept more.

03:11.580 --> 03:14.720
But it's the first painting I did that was almost entirely airbrushed.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.840
This is a whole airbrush around here.

03:16.980 --> 03:20.760
It's really just a spaceship that is put in by hand as it were.

03:24.340 --> 03:28.560
Strangely enough, I didn't care a whole lot for the book or not as much as I had hoped

03:28.560 --> 03:28.900
I would.

03:29.540 --> 03:34.120
I felt that Arthur didn't answer many of the important questions raised in both the books.

03:35.100 --> 03:39.560
The motivation of the aliens, what the ultimate destiny of Earth would be, et cetera, et cetera.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.740
None of that was answered.

03:40.740 --> 03:43.720
And that left me feeling a little bit upset.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.080
But I enjoyed doing the painting.

03:47.960 --> 03:48.480
Okay.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.980
What about the gold and green?

03:52.660 --> 03:57.620
You've been doing the Piper stuff ever since they came out.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.840
The beginning, right, since they started reprinting.

04:01.120 --> 04:06.580
The concept behind this is that the fuzzies are not indigenous to this planet.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.280
They've crash-landed from their alien species even to this alien planet.

04:10.960 --> 04:18.180
And they've lost the entire record of their previous world in the ship, which was buried

04:18.180 --> 04:18.980
in a landslide.

04:20.040 --> 04:26.440
And so a lot of what this book has to do about is the succeeding loss of knowledge from generation

04:26.440 --> 04:31.600
to generation, each younger generation learns a little bit less than the previous one about

04:31.600 --> 04:33.720
their previous lifestyle, their technology, and everything.

04:33.720 --> 04:38.300
And that's what's symbolized by this bright red butterfly that's flying out of reach of

04:38.300 --> 04:39.840
this younger fuzzie here.

04:40.920 --> 04:48.140
The golden dream is, in fact, the hope that someday the fuzzies will have picked up the

04:48.140 --> 04:50.860
distress call before it was cut off by the landslide.

04:51.460 --> 04:55.140
And will one day come to rescue the ones that have been stranded on this planet.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.580
And that's why this one is off looking towards the sky.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.880
That's pretty much what's involved in this painting.

05:01.880 --> 05:07.440
And I like exploring the environment, coming up with the different plants and all that kind of stuff.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.560
That one won the Hugo, right?

05:11.580 --> 05:15.980
Well, you win a Hugo for the work you've done over the period of a year or whatever.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.680
You know, as a best artist or whatever.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.760
So it's not for this particular piece.

05:19.860 --> 05:24.000
This one best show at the World Science Fiction Convention.

05:25.100 --> 05:28.540
That's where I saw this one at Denvention.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.220
And this one was for Delaney's book.

05:31.220 --> 05:33.520
Yeah, this is a curious story to it.

05:34.140 --> 05:38.920
Byron Price, the publisher, called me up and told me he was doing a book of short stories

05:38.920 --> 05:40.280
by Samuel R. Delaney.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.700
He said, I could do anything I wanted for the cover.

05:43.020 --> 05:43.780
So I said, great.

05:44.040 --> 05:50.820
You know, I sat down and I came up with, oh, maybe eight really, what's the word?

05:52.100 --> 05:56.800
I felt they were spectacular concepts for this cover, but they were rather semi-mystical

05:56.800 --> 05:57.280
and feeling.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.280
And they didn't go for any of them.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.080
And so they sent me a sketch of what they wanted for the cover.

06:02.220 --> 06:07.180
And it showed a man coming into a porthole on one side and a woman in a lacy nightgown

06:07.180 --> 06:09.660
on the other, on the back cover, waiting for a man to come home.

06:10.960 --> 06:11.920
It was terrible.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.300
So this is what they got.

06:14.860 --> 06:20.380
And I joked with them and said that, well, it will really be liberated when they put

06:20.380 --> 06:22.440
the woman on the front for a change and the man on the back.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.820
But they're both coming home from work.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.440
In essence is what they're doing.

06:27.140 --> 06:29.660
And then granted, you see raw space behind them.

06:29.740 --> 06:33.200
But that's, you know, I say it's because there's a glass and clothes bubble on the outside.

06:34.880 --> 06:38.440
But the other reason I have for doing this painting is I was driving down the highway

06:38.440 --> 06:40.820
once and I went under a bridge on either side of the bridge.

06:40.960 --> 06:47.000
I had these signs with these yellow and black marks on them, you know, on either side.

06:47.100 --> 06:55.160
And I was struck just by the imagery of these symmetrical orange and black stripes on either

06:55.160 --> 06:55.780
side of this bridge.

06:56.300 --> 07:00.180
That's pretty much how the composition for the painting came about was just that mental

07:00.180 --> 07:05.780
image and then constructing the lights to give the feeling that this painting has.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.740
There's a little bit of very much work in this painting also, especially just the creative

07:11.740 --> 07:14.880
glare effect around the lights and the background here.

07:16.220 --> 07:19.040
Okay, this is one of my buddy's favorites over here.

07:19.980 --> 07:25.180
Yeah, this was an illustration for a poem by Robert E. Howard that never got published.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.360
And hence the name of the painting is the Mad Poet.

07:29.260 --> 07:38.080
And what you have here is a man in a dark room being illuminated by Luna, the moon.

07:38.460 --> 07:43.120
And the substance of his mad dreams is seen in the floating smoke.

07:44.460 --> 07:48.280
And there's all those little demons and creatures in the smoke there coming out of the candle.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.200
That's, the light has been extinguished also.

07:51.400 --> 07:56.720
It's all symbolic, metaphorical stuff indicating a state of mind.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.060
But these are all paintings.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.640
By the way, I didn't use any models for anything.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.920
Used a model for that one there.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.260
But you know, you asked me about that, you know.

08:11.380 --> 08:12.780
I just wanted to point that out.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.800
Amazing dragon.

08:15.800 --> 08:24.120
And this painting here was commissioned from me by TSR Hobbies who has bought out Amazing

08:24.120 --> 08:24.860
Stories magazine.

08:25.220 --> 08:30.140
And they wanted to kick off their new acquisition as it were with a cover that symbolized both

08:30.720 --> 08:32.380
elements of fantasy and science fiction.

08:32.600 --> 08:36.320
So I used the astronaut as a symbol of science fiction and dragon as a symbol of fantasy.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.740
Just put them together in a visually interesting way.

08:41.620 --> 08:42.820
Sounds easy, doesn't it?

08:43.820 --> 08:46.980
It's really, yeah, it took a long time, definitely.

08:49.800 --> 08:53.340
Also, I'd always wanted to develop a black dragon after doing the white dragon.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.860
And this was the first opportunity I had to do that.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.540
So that is another reason why I wanted to do the painting.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.020
Equal opportunity for dragons.

09:02.980 --> 09:03.700
Excuse me.

09:09.060 --> 09:12.920
This fellow looks a little like you.

09:13.920 --> 09:14.360
He doesn't really.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.460
I mean, he doesn't have my profile.

09:15.720 --> 09:16.320
Everyone says that.

09:16.460 --> 09:17.120
Why I don't know.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.900
He just came out of my head.

09:19.140 --> 09:23.160
So it could be, there's some of me in there.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.580
But it wasn't my intention to do so.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.200
So if that's true, it's accidental.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.640
You are in CJ Cherry's cover on it.

09:31.660 --> 09:31.800
Yeah.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.620
Out of around 200 paintings, I've put myself in three of them, I think.

09:36.240 --> 09:36.700
Three or four.

09:39.020 --> 09:39.840
That I know about.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.920
I mean, maybe unintentionally, I put myself in there.

09:43.380 --> 09:46.400
I was away in England for six weeks or so.

09:46.540 --> 09:51.820
And I hadn't touched a pencil to a paper or brush to canvas or anything that whole time.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.520
I didn't even think about painting.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.760
Well, I mean, I did when I went to an art gallery or whatever.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.200
But I didn't think about myself painting at all.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.800
And when I came back quite frankly, I wasn't sure I still had it in me.

10:01.420 --> 10:05.380
I felt very strange when I came back after all that time.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.400
And I sat down, this pain just kind of came out of me without any effort at all.

10:09.620 --> 10:11.700
And it really felt good.

10:11.940 --> 10:15.580
It was just a reassurance I needed to get back into doing what I was doing.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.380
So I had a really good feeling about it.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.120
Well, after that long period, after a couple of months, who knows?

10:23.620 --> 10:23.940
I don't know.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.020
I don't take anything for granted.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.000
But, right.

10:27.780 --> 10:29.900
I feel like a lot of my work is just trial and error anyway.

10:30.340 --> 10:32.760
I don't know.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.600
I have bad memory about a lot of things.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.120
Some things I've got a good photographic memory towards.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.640
Visual information.

10:41.160 --> 10:47.960
But it's about procedures and conceptual things.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.140
Sometimes I'm pretty forgetful.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.120
So I have to, you know, who knows?

10:51.920 --> 10:55.000
That's why a lot of my artwork looks different from one piece to the other.

10:55.140 --> 10:59.240
It's because I think it's more that I forget from one painting to another how to do a painting

10:59.240 --> 11:02.020
than it is that I deliberately try to vary it.

11:02.820 --> 11:07.140
There are artists like Norman Rockwell who developed a stylistic technique for doing a

11:07.140 --> 11:08.720
painting back when they were 18 or something.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.520
They never varied from that for the entire lifetime.

11:10.980 --> 11:13.680
It was always, you did this, then you did this, then you did this, then you did this,

11:13.680 --> 11:14.960
then you did this, then you did this, then you did this, then you did this, then you

11:14.960 --> 11:15.360
did this and you had a painting.

11:16.940 --> 11:19.220
And I never have a set standard.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.880
I never have a set procedure.

11:21.660 --> 11:25.180
The way I did this painting is totally different from the way I did this one from the way I

11:25.180 --> 11:26.660
did that one from that from that from that.

11:27.980 --> 11:34.220
I mean, I think I have it down to about eight different approaches now probably, but it

11:34.220 --> 11:35.020
doesn't make it easier.

11:35.500 --> 11:40.660
It definitely adds time to the time it takes to do a painting and the mental anguish also.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.380
You said you used a model on this one.

11:49.580 --> 11:50.180
No, not this one.

11:50.320 --> 11:50.900
This one.

11:51.300 --> 11:57.060
He's the same model for both figures because they are supposed to be twins, but she's a

11:57.060 --> 11:57.660
girl named Carrie.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.800
She posed for me for that particular painting.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.080
And not for this one I did.

12:04.060 --> 12:06.180
There's hardly a need to because she's all covered in armor.

12:11.720 --> 12:12.900
This one here is Amazon.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.720
And just for the benefit of anyone listening to this, we're talking about Amazons and Amazons

12:16.720 --> 12:16.980
too.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.800
These are both books about women warriors.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.140
You can see quite a variation in color, can't you?

12:23.360 --> 12:24.460
From this to this.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.900
Look at the color of the moon here and the yellowish cast here.

12:26.980 --> 12:27.780
It's been completely lost.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.480
That's something that it's hard for an artist to deal with.

12:30.580 --> 12:35.400
It's a loss of quality and reproduction on book covers.

12:36.860 --> 12:37.640
Yeah, I've heard this one.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.640
There's not much you can do about it.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.720
I've heard that some of the publishers are going to try and switch over to a laser printing

12:41.720 --> 12:43.080
method, which is much more accurate.

12:43.600 --> 12:43.960
Maybe so.

12:44.080 --> 12:44.820
And it's going to result from that.

12:46.980 --> 12:48.960
Did you're doing this one?

12:49.940 --> 12:51.300
Is that what brought you to the cycle?

12:52.320 --> 12:52.720
Yes.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.660
Sometimes I've found that I've become a bargaining chip for the publishers.

12:58.920 --> 13:05.940
They'll tell an author, well, if you let us shave $1,000 off of the money, our royalties

13:05.940 --> 13:08.420
that we're supposed to pay for a particular job will let you have a way on the cover.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.040
So you sell more books anyway and get the money back.

13:11.700 --> 13:15.180
So we'll take the money off your advance and just add percentage on your royalties.

13:15.180 --> 13:19.360
And they'll agree to that in advance because the authors polish on the cover by me.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.780
And I think that happened in this particular instance.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.940
Well, actually, I shouldn't say that because I don't know for certain.

13:24.180 --> 13:25.400
It's just been a rumor that I heard.

13:27.260 --> 13:30.500
These are both books about women warriors.

13:30.800 --> 13:36.940
And I use the moon as a symbol of femininity, both in this case and in this one here where

13:36.940 --> 13:40.920
you have the moon beginning to eclipse the sun.

13:40.920 --> 13:46.040
It's a symbol of femininity, over-masculinity here because they're attacking a ship.

13:46.160 --> 13:54.740
There was indeed a Chinese, a female pirate in the China seas in the 1800s who did terrify

13:54.740 --> 13:58.720
and plunder many ships with their crew.

13:59.640 --> 14:04.140
And she in fact retired to live a long life in China.

14:04.420 --> 14:08.760
But is that that vague concept that brought about this pain?

14:09.780 --> 14:11.720
Yeah, I'm going to buy the upgrade of that one.

14:12.560 --> 14:21.140
I was thinking that just to carry this idea on further, when I read about this particular Chinese,

14:21.980 --> 14:26.080
female Chinese pirate and her crew of Amazons,

14:27.880 --> 14:32.580
plundering Portuguese and Spanish ships in the China seas among Japanese ships or whatever,

14:32.720 --> 14:35.880
I thought how interesting their armor must have looked because they would have acquired

14:35.880 --> 14:39.360
different bits and pieces from all these different types of countries.

14:40.220 --> 14:45.540
And so she's got a Portuguese dagger and a western style chainmail and yet this one has

14:45.540 --> 14:50.520
a more Japanese type of covering over the upper part of her torso.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.940
And this is more oriental in feeling this armor here and here also.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.360
You do much study in ancient weaponry and stuff like that?

14:58.360 --> 14:59.080
Not a whole lot.

14:59.640 --> 15:03.780
When I go to another country or something, I'll go to a museum to try to pick up,

15:04.180 --> 15:05.680
well not just another country.

15:05.820 --> 15:10.100
When I go anywhere that has an armor museum, I'll try to go and see it and study it.

15:10.180 --> 15:14.740
But it's almost always buying class cases so you can't get a good photograph of it and all that.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.040
So I have to rely on my memory mostly.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.740
I've got a few books on it that help bring back my recollection of what it looked like.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.760
The best thing about going, I remember the first time I went to a museum that had armor in it,

15:25.820 --> 15:30.240
just to look at the armor and what a revelation was to see how it's strapped up from behind.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.680
I mean obviously you can't always show somebody from the front.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.680
If you don't know how it ties together in the back, you really suck.

15:37.920 --> 15:41.640
The way that it buckles up and everything behind the legs and all that.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.960
That was really important to me to figure that out.

15:44.040 --> 15:48.020
But once I saw how it goes, generally, that's pretty much the same for all armor.

15:48.700 --> 15:52.000
You never want to fight somebody and have somebody come from behind you with you and have armor on.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.680
It's only a tank from the front.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.340
Generally, yeah, that's true.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.000
Don't forget 12, 30 days.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.240
Gee, 12, 30.

16:04.260 --> 16:05.200
No, no, it's a long time.

16:05.320 --> 16:05.960
Just don't forget.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.640
I think we're about finished here.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.160
Let me turn myself off.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.660
Never again will that happen.

16:19.040 --> 16:19.680
No way.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.720
When you paint a cover like this, you retain all the ranks, right?

16:22.840 --> 16:23.160
Absolutely.

16:24.660 --> 16:30.880
All I sell is the first one-time non-exclusive North American English language

16:30.880 --> 16:34.400
paperback cover art rights or hardcover art rights or whatever.

16:34.920 --> 16:35.900
Everything else is mine.

16:36.740 --> 16:39.200
I have an agent in Germany who sells European rights.

16:39.380 --> 16:43.560
I sell rights to companies in Japan or whatever, and they'll be able to use the artwork.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.740
Otherwise, it's not much of a living.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.920
That is pretty much how you have to supplement it.

16:51.060 --> 16:52.480
And then the final sell, the artwork.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.700
We'll bring in added revenues, but...

16:59.160 --> 17:03.340
I'm being told time and time again that I'm pretty much at the top of my profession.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.520
If this is the top, it doesn't say much for it, you know,

17:06.560 --> 17:10.800
because there isn't a tremendous amount of money to be made doing paperback covers or book covers.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.800
Unless you're exceedingly fast and you can turn them out.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.800
Now, the guy who did the cover for Shogun and a bunch of other books,

17:17.880 --> 17:20.420
he does over 100 covers a year.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.100
So if he makes 1,500 a cover,

17:25.700 --> 17:27.680
he's making a pretty respectable living.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.860
But I do 2 to 4 a month tops.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.600
That's one quarter of his output.

17:36.160 --> 17:41.100
Does your revenue come back from the publishers coming in the form of royalty or just a straight payment?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.040
It's a straight payment.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.020
There have been publishers that have tried to get not publishers.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.960
There have been a couple of small publishers that talk to royalties.

17:50.460 --> 17:55.220
And some artists, ridiculously enough, are fighting for that, for a royalty type of system.

17:55.440 --> 17:59.400
But publishers are really never going to go for that because they don't want the added bookkeeping.

17:59.780 --> 18:03.660
I mean, it's already a nightmare for the authors to try to collect from their royalties,

18:03.680 --> 18:06.200
but the artists would be totally ridiculous.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.560
I want my money now.

18:10.720 --> 18:15.120
I'm not going to trust them to pay me because I've had too many times when I've had royalty arrangements,

18:15.120 --> 18:18.500
either as an author or as an artist in a few other books,

18:19.820 --> 18:23.440
that I've had the higher lawyers to go out to the publishers to collect and everything.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.300
By the time I'd go through all this rigmarole,

18:27.060 --> 18:29.320
I might as well have just thrown it away.

18:30.200 --> 18:34.620
I've lost more than I've gained, so I definitely would not want to see a royalty system.

18:35.780 --> 18:42.540
And I think that if a publisher wants to institute some way of paying an artist back for a book that sells really well,

18:42.540 --> 18:44.300
they've got to just have a bonus type of thing.

18:44.400 --> 18:48.940
If you do really good, you get paid a straight fee, but if it gets on the best or less, you get an added fee or whatever.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.400
That'd be a good way to do it.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.300
You've written some also?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.420
Well, I have a book on my own artwork called Wonder Works,

18:56.520 --> 18:58.760
and it's got a little bit of writing by me in there.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.600
And we're starting to work on the second Wonder Works now.

19:05.100 --> 19:10.020
In fact, I just picked up my quote for the opening page in my second book.

19:10.860 --> 19:14.480
I feel like I'm really on my way to getting the book done now.

19:16.440 --> 19:20.860
If words weren't going to go for the peer, would you pay?

19:20.900 --> 19:21.240
Absolutely.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.800
That's the limitation of doing book covers,

19:24.940 --> 19:32.020
is that you do have graphic design considerations in terms of the type, the title, and all that kind of stuff.

19:32.960 --> 19:36.080
I'm probably less constrained by that than other artists,

19:36.200 --> 19:38.640
because they're willing to kind of work around how I do it.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.220
But I'm always unconscious of it.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.860
So things get bottom weighted so that there's room on top for type.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.120
And I'm used to it.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.300
It's a constant challenge.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.920
When I'm doing a wrap-around cover, one that goes over the spine onto the back,

19:53.260 --> 19:56.900
then I get a chance to do a horizontal format, and I get a lot of those jobs.

20:00.060 --> 20:04.600
I make sure to take once or twice a year an assignment where I'm doing interior illustrations,

20:04.720 --> 20:06.340
where I don't have to be worried about type at all.

20:06.340 --> 20:12.660
And if I ever get a chance to do things for myself, of course, then I don't have to worry about type either.

20:13.720 --> 20:14.760
But I don't.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.160
I never give myself time to do something just for myself, unfortunately.

20:18.600 --> 20:22.560
I mean, all my illustrations are for myself, because I consider myself an illustrator more than anything.

20:22.760 --> 20:31.440
But I would like to do something where I don't have to worry about any consideration at all, type,

20:31.440 --> 20:37.900
or design format, or public standards of taste, or decency, or anything.

20:38.200 --> 20:44.160
I'm just completely paying exactly what comes into my mind, exactly the way I see it, without any considerations.

20:44.480 --> 20:44.980
What's my...

20:46.700 --> 20:49.300
Do you have to consider doing an art book along those lines?

20:51.340 --> 20:51.780
No.

20:52.740 --> 20:53.440
Not really.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.820
It's out of my...

20:55.820 --> 20:58.760
I wouldn't consider it simply because I wouldn't give myself the time to.

20:58.760 --> 21:05.560
There's too many good books I want to illustrate that I wouldn't want to take the amount of time it would take to do a whole art book

21:06.600 --> 21:09.020
of just pieces I've done entirely for myself.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.760
It would be a 25-year process, probably, to do something like that.

21:14.700 --> 21:15.100
And...

21:16.840 --> 21:18.060
That's a right time to...

21:18.060 --> 21:21.380
I don't know. I don't think I'd want to be involved in something that long-term.

21:21.740 --> 21:26.720
I don't think I'll even be... I'm not even sure I'll be painting, you know, that long for now.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.940
I may develop another interest between now and then.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.160
So who knows?

21:30.640 --> 21:31.900
Can you show me how to write a picture?

21:33.040 --> 21:34.200
A pair of hot scenes?

21:34.200 --> 21:35.740
One hopes you won't give it up entirely.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.040
I doubt it. I don't think I'll ever give up illustrating.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.240
I certainly won't give up painting, and...

21:44.380 --> 21:47.220
One thing I know I'll always be doing is rendering a human figure.

21:47.380 --> 21:50.480
That's probably the core of my interest in art.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.700
So I'll be kicking around for a few years to come anyway.

21:56.820 --> 21:58.220
Thank you.
