00:04.120 --> 00:04.440
Okay.

00:08.300 --> 00:17.920
Take a listen. Okay, Darryl? What? Oh. Testing, one, two, three, four. Testing,
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Testing. How's Darryl? Does it sound

00:17.920 --> 00:26.580
okay? That's what you always hear Darryl. Once he starts talking, it's loud. Oh,
wait a minute. Okay, try again. Testing, one, two, three, four. There it is.

00:27.080 --> 00:36.920
Hello, testing. Hello, hello. Testing, four, three, two, one. Four, three, two,
one testing. Testing some more, one, two, three, four, four, three, two, one. I

00:36.920 --> 00:41.500
think we can adjust the rest of it when we, that's tops. Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:54.820 --> 01:01.400
Your name is pronounced Saberhagen, correct? Saberhagen, yes. I have a tendency
to say Saberhagen. I guess other people do too. Well, there are many variations.

01:01.880 --> 01:11.660
Yeah. But Saberhagen is what they taught me when I was a kid. Yeah, that's good.
I guess that's it. Yeah. Oh, we ready? Are we rolling? Yeah, we're rolling. Oh,

01:11.740 --> 01:20.920
should we go? Uh, yeah. Um, did you tell them what basic format of this is going
to be? Uh, what do you mean? I don't know how we're going to do the interview.

01:21.040 --> 01:32.060
Oh, I thought we were. Oh, yeah. Uh, Mr. Saberhagen, could you tell us some
things about your, your origins as a writer? I, I, do I understand it that you

01:32.060 --> 01:41.580
did not start out as a science fiction writer? Uh, Saberhagen. Saberhagen. Let
me try again. Sorry, did you? Did I say Saberhagen? Yeah. Sorry, okay. Uh, Mr.

01:41.700 --> 01:50.700
Saberhagen, would you tell us a little about your origins as a writer? Uh, I
understand that you did not start out writing science fiction. Well, no, they,

01:50.700 --> 02:03.160
the first thing I wrote and sold was, uh, science fiction. And, actually, I did,
my writing career did start with science fiction, and, um, through this I got a

02:03.160 --> 02:13.720
job at Encyclopedia Britannica. I was on the editorial staff for five or six
years. They were bringing out their, uh, in the early, in the late 60s and early

02:13.720 --> 02:26.680
70s, they had this complete revision of the whole, whole set. And they hired
many writers and editors for that. Uh, no, I, um, I started writing before I

02:26.680 --> 02:32.240
was, uh, before I got into, uh, I can't say I got into fandom. Uh,

02:36.820 --> 02:46.480
writing, writing science fiction was, was where it started. Okay, uh, you said
you did not, you, you didn't come out of the, the fan structure of science

02:46.480 --> 02:53.640
fiction? You weren't one of them? No, I, I had, I had, uh, written and sold, uh,
a story, or a couple of stories, I guess, before I knew there were such things

02:53.640 --> 03:05.180
as, as fan clubs and, uh, conventions and all this. Did you read much science
fiction before you started writing it? Yeah, I, I read, when I, when I was very

03:05.180 --> 03:15.520
young, when I was like eight or nine years old, I came upon this, uh, old pulp
magazine, secondhand magazine someplace, and there were a couple of stories in

03:15.520 --> 03:25.780
there that really impressed me. And I think they scared the daylights out of me,
actually. And I was, magazines of that kind were prohibited from, for a while

03:25.780 --> 03:37.000
from being brought into the house. Because I guess I was sort of turned inside
out by some of these things. But, uh, then I, I just, you know, kind of went

03:37.000 --> 03:46.700
away from it for a few years. And when I was about 16, I started, uh, haunting
the secondhand magazine shops, which they then had in Chicago. And, uh, picking

03:46.700 --> 03:59.820
up old copies of Astounding, and, uh, which, as it was then called. And then I,
I didn't really get into writing, uh, until later on. I was in the, in the Air

03:59.820 --> 04:14.040
Force in my twenties, and I would, I had a lot of time on my hands. I would make
a stab at it now and then. And, uh, still, I guess I didn't have access to a

04:14.040 --> 04:30.960
typewriter and, uh, all this privacy and so on. And, still nothing really came
of it. And I was in, uh, let's see, I was almost 30 before I actually, uh,

04:32.600 --> 04:41.580
sat down and seriously wrote a, wrote a story and, and really typed out the
manuscript properly and, and got it. Got it, got it, went and sent it off to be

04:41.580 --> 04:53.820
sold. And then I, I started selling. I didn't sell everything I wrote, but I, I
started selling some things right away. And from then on, it's been my main

04:53.820 --> 05:06.040
occupation. Well, not always a full-time job, but it's, it's what I've done.
You've never done any mainstream writing at all that was published? Uh, no, I

05:06.040 --> 05:10.480
don't, uh, I

05:10.480 --> 05:20.720
guess when, when you say mainstream, I guess I'm, I'm coming to think, uh, more
and more of mainstream as a, uh, as kind of an offshoot of, uh, of writing or

05:20.720 --> 05:31.020
literature or whatever you call it, where you're, you're limited to, uh, to
things that could only happen with a high probability in the, in the next block,

05:31.060 --> 05:42.760
in the next two months or something like that. And I think if you, if you look
back historically, uh, most of the literature has really been, been wide open.

05:42.920 --> 05:52.080
You're allowed to use ghosts. You're allowed to use, uh, go to other planets.
You can do all these, uh, all these things. We've somehow turned this around

05:52.080 --> 06:02.700
and, and put this in a, uh, its own little ghetto. But I think it's, it really
should be the other way. Um, would you be able to say anything about why it was

06:02.700 --> 06:09.640
science fiction that made you, would you say science fiction made you become a
writer or would you have done so otherwise? What, what was it about the field

06:09.640 --> 06:23.380
that, that detracted you and, and made you decide to, to try your hand at it? I
guess just the, the freedom of ideas of, um, being able to put in, uh, not, of

06:23.380 --> 06:34.840
not being limited to, uh, the next block or the next two months. And the, uh,
the book I just finished, uh, for Ace, it's called Octagon. And it's probably as

06:34.840 --> 06:46.460
close to a mainstream, uh, thing as I've ever done. It's, it's, uh, set in the
very near future. And it's about, largely about computers and programming and

06:46.460 --> 06:57.280
people who play games with computers. And I, I guess when I started to write it,
it was, it was still science fiction. And by the time it's published, it may be,

06:57.420 --> 07:06.960
uh, uh, a little, just a little out of date even. I don't know. A lot of
readers, uh, you probably know this. A lot of readers associate you, of course,

07:07.000 --> 07:13.900
with the Berserker series. Yeah. And I think you might, to some readers, you
might be typed. You know, as, you know, Fred Saberhagen, the Berserker author.

07:14.140 --> 07:21.240
Uh-huh. Does that, uh, does that bother you? Have you tried to, uh, or please
you? Have you tried to overcome that, or? I mean, I'm talking about readers who

07:21.240 --> 07:29.920
don't know you very well. Obviously, you're, the body of your work is very
flexible. You've done many things. Yeah. Um, I think what, uh, what's got the

07:29.920 --> 07:42.880
biggest reader response by far is the, uh, the Dracula books I've done. Uh, I
get more, uh, more letters and, uh, mail and sometimes more money for, for one

07:42.880 --> 07:53.260
of those. And then for the, uh, you know, all the Berserkers. Uh, the Berserkers
have been around a long time and a lot of people have, uh, have picked up on

07:53.260 --> 08:04.420
them over the years. But they're, uh, they're not really what's, what sells the
most books now. Uh, the response, you talk about reader response to the Dracula

08:04.420 --> 08:14.140
material, uh, I guess there's no way of your knowing this, but would those be
science fiction readers responding? Or, uh, because I've, when I see, sometimes

08:14.140 --> 08:21.040
when I see lists of your published work, they often leave the Dracula material
off of it because, I guess, you know, it's not considered a hard science

08:21.040 --> 08:31.320
fiction. Yeah, some people, sometimes you see it on the fantasy, uh, uh, shelf
in the bookstore. Sometimes you see it in occult. Sometimes, sometimes you see

08:31.320 --> 08:41.920
it on the new shelf where all the, the, uh, uh, the zombies and, and, uh,
haunted babies and all these, all these modern, uh, recent things, uh, appear.

08:42.880 --> 08:49.700
Uh, I don't, I don't really care as long as people are reading it. Uh, I don't
know if they're science fiction readers. Some of them think they're vampires.

08:50.720 --> 09:02.260
Uh, you get a pretty good, maybe some of them are vampires. You get a pretty
good letter here and there, uh, which I don't answer as a rule. Now, there have

09:02.260 --> 09:10.460
been four of those books, right, beginning with the Holmes Dracula file? No,
the, the Dracula tape is the first one, which is a recounting of the original,

09:10.680 --> 09:21.820
Bram Stoker's original Dracula story. Only seen from the view of, point of view
of the count. And there's Holmes Dracula, and an old friend of the family, and

09:21.820 --> 09:37.540
Thorn, which is out now. And I'm talking to, about, to, uh, Jim Bain, the, uh,
editor at, uh, Tom Doherty Associates now about another. Um,

09:40.380 --> 09:47.220
I think, I'm not sure what, I'm not sure about that one yet, but we're talking
about it. Well, as long as we brought up that, the home, the Dracula material,

09:47.460 --> 09:59.140
um. Yeah, how is it that you got interested in, uh, that, one of the more
famous, uh, possibly mythological, possibly not mythological creatures? Well, I,

09:59.140 --> 10:09.260
I, it started, I just sat down one day, and just, just for fun, I, I, uh, wanted
to reread the original Dracula, which I had read once before, years, years

10:09.260 --> 10:22.120
earlier. And it's, I think it's not all that, that good a book, really, apart
from this, this titanic, uh, devilish, central character. And, uh, but it, it

10:22.120 --> 10:31.200
struck me more and more as I, as I read through it, that, uh, Dracula was hardly
ever on stage. And this thing, everybody's talking about him, and he's almost

10:31.200 --> 10:35.120
always off somewhere doing something nobody quite knows what.

10:38.140 --> 10:46.640
So I guess maybe I had Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead on my mind, or
something like that. But I, I just thought, what would it look like from, uh,

10:47.280 --> 10:58.720
from the chief villain's point of view? So, uh, off I went. It was, it was, uh,
an awful lot of fun to write, and it just seemed to go right along. And then,

10:58.920 --> 11:10.560
uh, the, uh, time came to think about doing a sequel for it, and it occurred to
me that nobody had ever put Holmes and Dracula in the same book up to that

11:10.560 --> 11:21.560
point, as far as I knew. And it, it seemed to me they, this would be very
interesting, it's as if they represented the two, two sides of the human psyche,

11:21.840 --> 11:32.160
or, or, uh, you know, the intellect and the, the dark side. And here they were,
they were contemporaries, they were in the same, same city in the same year,

11:32.420 --> 11:44.180
and, uh, uh, everybody knew about them both, and still they'd never, uh, you
know, they just completely, um, missed each other. So I decided I had to try to

11:44.180 --> 11:55.860
make contact there someplace. Yeah, I, I rather enjoyed, uh, the, sort of the
contest, Will's, uh, Holmes' great intelligence against, uh, Dracula's great

11:55.860 --> 12:05.020
experience. And, uh, especially if I remember correctly, one point where they're
in, uh, I believe it's in Holmes' study, and he's trying to coerce Dracula into

12:05.020 --> 12:11.800
doing something, he's protecting himself with a gun. Uh huh. And, of course,
Dracula goes, well, that's not going to do anything to me, and Holmes shoots

12:11.800 --> 12:25.940
him, and it's wooden bullets. Sorry. That was a, that was a marvelous scope of,
of ingenuity on your part. I like it. Um, did you research the, uh, the, the,

12:25.940 --> 12:34.620
the character of Dracula? You must have researched him fairly extensively. Uh,
yes, I, I, I did what I could. I looked up the, uh, you know, the historical,

12:34.900 --> 12:46.080
uh, sometimes you find, once you know his, his, uh, his other names and titles
and so on, sometimes you find references to him in these, these state historical

12:46.080 --> 12:57.520
articles in, in Britannica or somewhere else, uh, you know, known as this, uh,
uh, prince who was rather hard on his people and, and, uh, everyone else who

12:57.520 --> 13:08.860
came in the region. And, but you don't connect this, this guy with, uh, the, the
one in the legend. Uh, uh, what, what is the character that Dracula is based on?

13:09.060 --> 13:18.260
He's, uh, what was his name? Oh, I can't, it's, it's Vlad, uh, Tepes or Tepesh
or something like, I can't really pronounce it the, uh, uh, way it should be.

13:18.260 --> 13:33.520
But he was a, uh, a prince of, uh, Wallachia or Wallachia in, uh, not in
Transylvania, but, but very near to there. Uh, he lived in the 15th century. And

13:33.520 --> 13:45.560
he finally married the sister of the King of Hungary. Uh, like I go into some of
this in, uh, in Thorn and the, uh, one that's out now. He, he was imprisoned by

13:45.560 --> 13:51.920
the King of Hungary, supposedly for 12 years. And during this period, he somehow
married the King's sister.

13:54.580 --> 14:02.160
And from then on, the name of the King's sister was expunged from all the
records. So we, I don't think anybody knows now today even what her name was.

14:04.120 --> 14:14.700
And then Dracula was released and he was restored to power as, as a prince. And
then he was assassinated, uh, within a few months after that, I believe. And,

14:14.700 --> 14:26.280
uh, if his history goes on in this world from that point, uh, it's, uh, not
verified by the history books. But there, there certainly was a real, uh, real

14:26.280 --> 14:36.340
character. And then, then you get all these, these, uh, horror stories, atrocity
stories about him. Uh, many of which were, were really composed by his, his

14:36.340 --> 14:46.580
political enemies of the time. So, it's, he was certainly pretty nasty, but
it's, it's doubtful if he was really as, as bad as all the stories would have

14:46.580 --> 14:57.300
it. He had rather bad public relations. Yeah, I guess. Uh, in, in Thorn you had
sort of a dual storyline, uh, following, uh, some of the goings on back in the

14:57.300 --> 15:06.720
15th century. And then another story happening in the present. Yeah. Um, why'd
you decide to write it that way? Well, I, there's a couple of reasons. I like to

15:06.720 --> 15:18.440
do it that way because, uh, I think it moves, everything moves faster. If you
can switch from one, one group of characters to another, or from the same

15:18.440 --> 15:27.500
character at one time to another time. And a lot of the, the housekeeping
things, people moving around and getting ready for the next scene. And so a lot

15:27.500 --> 15:42.200
of that can go on off stage. And you just pick up where something is, is really
about to happen again. Um, and in effect it was like two, two short books. One,

15:42.200 --> 15:54.340
one set in modern times and one in the 15th century, as you point out. And this
makes one sizable book. And one sizable book sells better than, than two short

15:54.340 --> 16:04.780
books, I'm, I'm pretty sure. People seem to like, uh, big books, other things
being equal. Empire of the East is the, uh, certainly the best, best seller I've

16:04.780 --> 16:17.780
had, uh, so far. And it's really three, three short books rewritten and put into
one volume. You said, pardon me. You said that reader response for Dracula. Do

16:17.780 --> 16:25.560
that again. You need some time to chop that. Okay. You said that reader response
to the Dracula material was pretty high. Um, would you have written four books?

16:26.020 --> 16:33.360
Were it not, was it reader response that made, that caused you to write the
four? Would you have stopped it earlier? I don't know. It's, it's hard to say. I

16:33.360 --> 16:46.780
would, I would, um, sometimes you're wondering, should I write this book next or
that book? And, uh, meaning, uh, this idea or that idea. And if, if the editor

16:46.780 --> 17:00.400
calls up and says, uh, will you do us another book about Dracula? Then you
naturally are nudged into picking that idea over, over some other one. Uh, so I

17:00.400 --> 17:11.740
think it's a, kind of a mixed situation. Let's go on to the Berserker material
for just a little bit. Um, what got you started on that series? Do you remember

17:11.740 --> 17:22.700
the impetus or the idea that's caused that? Yeah, that's, that's one of the, uh,
one of the standard questions that I'll interview. Uh, I was writing, uh, very,

17:22.900 --> 17:36.000
let's see, back very early, uh, in the early 1960s. I was writing short stories,
most of which were being published in Galaxy or, uh, Worlds of If, Worlds of

17:36.000 --> 17:49.160
Tomorrow. Fred Pohl was the editor then. Um, and I had this good idea for a
short, kind of a puzzle short story. Um, how is the hero who is out in his one

17:49.160 --> 18:00.860
-man spaceship going to put together some kind of a, a, uh, device? Well, he has
an intelligent animal to help him. How is he going to use this, not, not really

18:00.860 --> 18:12.440
intelligent, but, uh, moderately for animal. Uh, how is he going to use this,
uh, moronic, uh, assistant of his and a few standard parts and put together some

18:12.440 --> 18:23.140
kind of a, uh, computing device that will play a game, you know, resembling
checkered or something like that. Yeah, it got fairly involved. Well, anyway, I

18:23.140 --> 18:33.440
had this, this is the, the idea. I had an idea how we should do that. This is
how it started. And I got about halfway through the story and, uh, I said, well,

18:33.520 --> 18:43.460
what sort of a villain will I have? And I said, I know what sort of villain I'll
have. I'll have this giant robotic spaceship, 50 miles in diameter, et cetera,

18:43.560 --> 18:55.100
et cetera. And it just, uh, you know, I just looked around and there it was. And
I don't know that story is, is, uh, still being reprinted, by the way. It's

18:55.100 --> 19:09.940
probably earns me more money this year than it did for first year it was, uh,
published. Uh, Fred Pohl really, uh, liked the berserker. He didn't, he bought

19:09.940 --> 19:17.500
the story. He wasn't all that crazy about the story, but he liked the berserker.
And he said, why don't you do some more berserkers and have somebody go on one

19:17.500 --> 19:27.780
of these things and, uh, so on. And, and it's just, uh, there for a while about
all I wrote was berserkers. Did you use the term berserker in that story? I

19:27.780 --> 19:39.500
thought that story was the game, wasn't it, if I recall? No, that story was
called, uh, uh, I called it, well, I had two titles. I was, I was going to call

19:39.500 --> 19:51.460
it To Move and Win. And Fred retitled it. He didn't like that. And he called it
Fortress Ship, which always struck me as, as something is not quite right,

19:51.640 --> 20:03.500
because the, uh, the thing was neither a fortress nor a ship. Uh, so it's, it
appears under, under, uh, two or three different titles in different collections

20:03.500 --> 20:12.000
and so on. The game came along much, much later. The term berserker though, did
you use that from the very beginning? That appears in the first, it says men

20:12.000 --> 20:22.960
called it, a berserker. Now, I, now I suppose I'd put, uh, people called it a
berserker, right. Would you, uh, could you say a little bit about the origin of

20:22.960 --> 20:35.760
that term? Um, well, it, it just seemed to, to pop up and, and naturally attach
itself. Of course, the, the berserkers historically are the, uh, Norse, uh,

20:36.520 --> 20:47.100
warriors who would, who would go mad and, and, uh, run around killing people
until they were killed. And I don't know why it, it just seemed to come along

20:47.100 --> 20:50.820
with the, uh, with the original concept and I used it.

20:54.500 --> 21:02.480
Um, I, I, I was kind of curious about this. Have you ever worked out any sort of
a timeline for your berserker material? It almost seems to me like a future

21:02.480 --> 21:10.640
history. Is it, was it menace such or could it be that way if somebody worked
out? I guess it could be. I, what I've, what I've tried to do is, is, is just

21:10.640 --> 21:22.640
always leave plenty of room in every direction. I have this, this war going on
for thousands of years and over the, at least a good part of the galaxy. And

21:22.640 --> 21:32.020
I've never really, uh, I guess if you asked me about two, two different stories,
I could probably tell you which one was supposed to come ahead of the other one.

21:32.020 --> 21:43.400
Um, but, uh, I just wanted to avoid being, uh, being too limited. Fred, Fred
Pohl thought I, uh, was about to wipe out all the berserkers there at one point.

21:43.520 --> 21:56.860
I did a story called Stone Place, where this huge berserker fleet was destroyed.
But I took care that, uh, some of them got away at least. Yeah. Of course, many

21:56.860 --> 22:03.600
of the stories are related. I recall some of them you'll, you'll end a story and
then pick, pick it up sometime later. Sometimes, yeah, sometimes the same, uh,

22:04.080 --> 22:14.840
characters, uh, uh, come and go. Uh, Johan Carlson and, uh, several others. And,
and, uh, it's kind of, uh, kind of fun to do that. I don't know if I'm going to

22:14.840 --> 22:27.760
write another, um, right now I don't have any, any special urge to write another
berserker story. You know, they don't know if they ever will or not. Hmm. Uh,

22:27.880 --> 22:36.160
what about the origin? The, the idea that, um, of course, the idea behind the
berserker, the way I read it, is that there's been this tremendous war, who

22:36.160 --> 22:44.440
knows how far in the past. And the berserkers are the remnants of one of the,
one of the races had built these computer robotic creatures to destroy life.

22:44.600 --> 22:53.420
Right. Um, do you think that, uh, a civilization that advanced would still have
violent, murderous tendencies, or would they tend to be more specific if they've

22:53.420 --> 23:03.900
gotten that? Well, the only advanced civilization we know of has, from time to
time, uh, violent, murderous tendencies. And I, I don't see why, uh, why we have

23:03.900 --> 23:14.120
to rule it out for, uh, for others. But isn't it, isn't it the human race, the
men in your, the whole series that, I get the impression if it weren't for the

23:14.120 --> 23:20.980
human race against the berserkers, that they, they've retained their ability to
make war. Yes. The other, the other races of the galaxy might have been wiped

23:20.980 --> 23:32.380
out by the berserkers. Yeah, that's, that's part of the background of the, of
the series. At least the races that we've, so, so far encountered. Um, I'm, I'm

23:32.380 --> 23:41.320
always trying to leave, uh, leave the door open for, uh, you know, I can, I can
say, well, it really wasn't entirely that way. There was an exception here or

23:41.320 --> 23:49.120
there somewhere. I was just curious because some people, I think it was, uh,
Norman Spinrad we talked to not too long ago, and he said any race that, uh,

23:50.180 --> 23:56.420
that becomes sufficiently advanced, you know, space travel and all, you know,
far out that they could not be violent because they couldn't have gotten that

23:56.420 --> 24:04.440
far, they would have destroyed themselves before then. Well, I don't know.
We're, here we are. We're on the verge of, of space travel and, uh, we're

24:04.440 --> 24:16.760
certainly, uh, violent, uh, from time to time at least. And it's just not in our
best interest to destroy ourselves and I don't, I don't think we will. We could

24:16.760 --> 24:24.900
have some nasty wars, but I don't think we're going to wipe ourselves out. Uh,
one of the stories, I had a specific question on one of your stories that

24:24.900 --> 24:32.320
interested me, uh, I think it was called In the Temple of Mars. Uh-huh. Where
you use the, the background there of Chaucer's Night's Tale. Why, uh, what made

24:32.320 --> 24:41.460
you do that? I was very curious about that. I, I guess I was just, had been
reading Chaucer probably and, and when something, uh, something grabs you or, or

24:41.460 --> 24:54.780
moves you or, or seems very intriguing, then the tendency is just to, to put it
into a story. And, and, uh, I think stories, stories profit by having, uh,

24:55.660 --> 25:08.900
different elements from, from different, uh, fields of ideas, uh, tied together.
Tied together, not just mixed, but somehow tied, tied together. Mm-hmm. And one

25:08.900 --> 25:16.640
of the novels too, I think, Brother Assassin, um, premise there is time travel.
Yeah. This particular area, this particular planet, I guess. Okay, yeah, the,

25:16.640 --> 25:24.040
the only, uh, I didn't, I didn't want, I, things would just get away from me, I
thought, if I had time travelers all over the galaxy and Berserkers at the same

25:24.040 --> 25:34.220
time. Uh, so I, I limited time travel in the Berserker universe to this one, one
world. Yeah. You know, one of the questions I had though about the, the

25:34.220 --> 25:42.940
particular encounter with the Berserkers there, uh, two things that to me were a
little unique. Uh, number one, there was a Berserker android, or pretty close to

25:42.940 --> 25:47.620
one. He could pass with the Monks Cow and so forth.

25:45.920 --> 25:52.600
But also at the end, the one Berserker that he implied that he had almost achieved life,

25:53.160 --> 25:56.900
that he had reached the point where he could appreciate what life was and he wasn't going to destroy it.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.060
That was the idea, yeah.

25:58.920 --> 26:03.460
Could you explain how, in other words, a machine, what he's been around so long,

26:03.600 --> 26:06.760
the evolution of machine intelligence to the point where...

26:06.760 --> 26:09.560
Well, he has, as I recall it, first about the android.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.760
I do have the androids in other stories.

26:12.300 --> 26:22.160
 Part of the, part of the rules of the game is that if a
human being gets a good close look at one, he's not fooled by it. He can't, uh,

26:23.200 --> 26:34.040
uh, uh, about the robot achieving life. I think the idea was that he, he had
through his, his time traveling, uh, uh, there through so many, I forget how

26:34.040 --> 26:46.020
many thousands of years, he had accumulated some kind of, of, uh, I forget what
I call it, evolutionary energy or something or other. It had acted on him as

26:46.020 --> 26:54.160
nothing else would have and he, he did become alive. Or it didn't come alive.
Was, does that answer the question? Yeah. I found that interesting. I hadn't

26:54.160 --> 26:59.640
noticed that in any of, any of your other, uh, stories or novels. No, he's the
only one. He's the only one that ever happened. In other words, it would be only

26:59.640 --> 27:09.480
that particular unit of the Berserkers, not the, uh. Oh, not the whole, uh, not
the whole, uh, uh, uh, uh, assembly of them, no. Another question on that novel

27:09.480 --> 27:19.600
I had, the, uh, two of the characters, I think it was Vincenzo and Brother
Jovan. Mm-hmm. Um, I notice, uh, in many of your works, you will use actual

27:19.600 --> 27:28.140
historical incidents or frameworks. Were either of those characters based on
actual historical people? Well, yeah, Vincenzo is, is Galileo, of course. And

27:28.140 --> 27:38.120
Brother Jovan is, uh, Francis of Assisi. I had suspected, I wanted to confirm.
Who were, of course, of course, were really several hundred years apart. But I,

27:38.120 --> 27:44.680
I kind of wondered what would happen, uh, it's like Holmes and Dracula, you
know, I wondered what would happen if I, if I could bring them together and, uh,

27:44.820 --> 27:57.960
get some kind of a spark from it. Yeah. Did you have any more on the Berserker
material? Uh, really one, but it's not for the tape. I'll ask you later. Just

27:57.960 --> 28:04.900
some point that I don't understand. And somebody else who read it, probably,
everybody probably doesn't have been me. Well, if you want, if you want to bring

28:04.900 --> 28:15.540
it up now. Okay, well, okay. Um, it's about, uh, it's on, it's in Berserker Man.
That was the latest one, right? Uh, yeah. Well, Ultimate Enemy, I think,

28:15.760 --> 28:23.460
actually, but that's a collection. Yeah, this is a collection. And, uh, I forget
which, I think, I forget which one has come out more recently, really. Okay.

28:23.560 --> 28:34.380
This one has stories that go further back, back in the 60s. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Um, the suit, Lancelot? Lancelot, yes, the, the suit of armor that, uh, Michelle

28:34.380 --> 28:51.120
wears, yeah. Um, at the end of the, uh, let me back up. Um, in Berserker Man, at
the end of it, um, where Michelle and Lancelot, the, uh, suit of armor that he

28:51.120 --> 29:02.460
wears. Yeah. Um, they approach the core... Of the galaxy. Of the galaxy. And
they, uh, he meets, is that a collection of individuals who are living there in

29:02.460 --> 29:15.300
the core? It's, uh, it's, it's a collection of representative individuals from
different, uh, the different intelligent races, or at least some of them, around

29:15.300 --> 29:25.600
the galaxy. And there's one spot left open, you know, one, the siege perilous,
one chair is still, uh, still to be occupied. And this is for Michelle. And what

29:25.600 --> 29:35.660
happens next, I really don't know. But presumably the whole, whole galaxy, you
know, the life in the galaxy moves up to some higher, higher level that we can't

29:35.660 --> 29:48.520
understand at this point. The one Berserker he was pursuing in there. Yes. Uh,
once it, uh, what exactly happened to it? I got the, uh, some, or, uh, I assumed

29:48.520 --> 30:00.960
that it realized what was there. Uh, well, it was, it was trying to reach this,
uh, this one remaining, uh, well, it, it didn't, it didn't know. At first it

30:00.960 --> 30:15.180
didn't know it was there, and, uh, then it was trying to, to fill this one
remaining, uh, slot there. And it couldn't do it, it just ground to a halt on

30:15.180 --> 30:26.060
the way. And possibly the realization that the Berserkers could never attain
that level? Uh, I guess something like that. I, I don't, I don't always think

30:26.060 --> 30:36.160
all these things out consciously, I guess, but they... Sometimes it's better not
to nail it down. Uh, I think maybe it's better for the writer not to nail it. I

30:36.160 --> 30:46.520
think it's a part, really part of the job of the, uh, you know, critics and
teachers and reviewers and whatever they... Um, to look into things and, and

30:46.520 --> 30:56.940
find things there that the, uh, the writer didn't know about. Seriously. In
other words, once the writer has finished the work, it's no longer part of his

30:56.940 --> 31:08.140
responsibility to, uh, to elucidate or explain, it's up to the readers and...
Basically, I think, yes, it's, uh, um, he can talk about it if he feels like as

31:08.140 --> 31:17.500
I'm talking about it now. But it's really not, his job is really done, and it's,
it's, uh, if other people want to take it seriously, then it's, it's their job

31:17.500 --> 31:29.020
to, uh, to work on it some. Um, interpretation will be left up to the individual
reader. Yeah, or the, the, uh, readers who get together and, and, uh, act as a

31:29.020 --> 31:38.680
group if they want to do that. Well, okay, on that point, just, let me follow
that up just for one more point here. Um, science fiction, it seems to me that

31:38.680 --> 31:49.560
there's one unique thing about the field, uh, the interaction between author and
fan. Like, maybe at the conventions and so forth, it seems to me that in no

31:49.560 --> 31:59.020
other area of writing I can think of is there such a, an interaction, you know,
between authors and fans. Uh, aren't you asked, I mean, if you go to

31:59.020 --> 32:06.380
conventions, maybe fan mail and so forth, aren't you pestered or asked by fans,
uh, what did you mean, what are you gonna do here? I mean, in other words, in no

32:06.380 --> 32:12.200
other field of writing besides science fiction is there that kind of interplay?
Yeah. Doesn't that make science fiction author kind of special in his? Yeah,

32:12.360 --> 32:22.200
there is, uh, often the fans, often the fans don't say, what are you going to
do? They, they come up and tell you what you did or they, uh, what you should

32:22.200 --> 32:34.460
have done or something or other. Uh, yeah, some, some are, are very, uh, um,
very intelligent and, and see things that, uh, as I say, the writer, writer

32:34.460 --> 32:46.720
himself doesn't see anything. Uh, do we have a, uh, break? Sure. Break it down.
Oh! We're still here. We're here. Are we here? I'm here. Testing one, two, three

32:46.720 --> 32:48.520
here. We're all here. We're all here. Very good.

32:52.520 --> 33:02.360
In your book, Empire of the East, the, uh, three separate stories were published
separately, weren't they? Uh, yeah, there were, originally there were three

33:02.360 --> 33:14.980
books, uh, The Broken Lands, uh, The Black Mountains, and Changeling Earth. And
they came out some years earlier, uh, with, split up among two different

33:14.980 --> 33:30.220
publishers, as it happened, the way, uh, problems of publishing and everything
being what they are. And then, uh, not long ago, uh, Jim Bain, uh, called me up

33:30.220 --> 33:35.040
and said, why don't you take these three books, and,

33:35.200 --> 33:38.700
uh, rewrite them, make a bigger ending.

33:41.480 --> 33:56.280
The ending, ending you've got is too, too small for, for one giant book. Rewrite
them, and, uh, we'll publish them in one volume. And they did. And he did. And

33:56.280 --> 34:10.800
even the, uh, big trade edition, it sold very well. And this one is, is doing
very well, and, uh, I'm very happy I got it. And I got a chance to, uh, to redo

34:10.800 --> 34:20.280
it just the way I wanted it. Now, the reason I was asking is, uh, the main
character in the first book is Rolf. Yeah. And, but in the, in the second two

34:20.280 --> 34:28.340
books, the main character shifts to, uh, Chuck. And I was just wondering if that
was because there was a time difference between, when you originally wrote them.

34:28.620 --> 34:40.980
Well, no, I think maybe what it is, is, uh, people, villains, or people with a
good touch of villainy in them are more fascinating to me, at least. And I, I, I

34:40.980 --> 34:53.160
seemed to do better with vampires, berserkers, uh, villainous, uh, warlords and
so on. And I just seemed to wind up approaching things from that point of view.

34:53.840 --> 35:01.680
Well, did that, did that sort of grow as you, as you went through the series?
Like, at the beginning, you know, the first book, I thought Chuck was going to

35:01.680 --> 35:09.480
be the, you know, the really bad guy. And I was fascinated to watch him. And I
don't suppose you could say he was turned into the hero or the good guy, but he

35:09.480 --> 35:18.600
still changed and got a definite, did that grow as you wrote or did you plan
that? No, that, that grew. Um, when I started, I, I didn't, uh, when I started,

35:18.700 --> 35:26.680
I knew I was fairly sure I was going to do a trilogy. And I started the first
book, I knew pretty well how the first book was going to end, but I had no idea

35:26.680 --> 35:35.700
how the trilogy was going or, or who Ardna was going to turn out to be, you
know, if we ever solved the problem. So, and as I went along, it, it just seemed

35:35.700 --> 35:49.600
to, you know, straighten itself out or, or take the form that it did. I have to
ask something about Ardna and the change. Um, maybe this isn't. Yeah. I'm out.

35:49.940 --> 36:01.840
Yeah. Okay. That's okay. I was asking him a question. You are? That's right.
Okay. Yeah. Uh, the power that you call Ardna in the book, Empire of the East.

36:02.440 --> 36:12.660
This may not be a fair question to ask of an author, but, um, I was puzzled by
what Ardna was. Uh, I know what his function was to initiate the change, I

36:12.660 --> 36:22.100
suppose, way back. Yeah. But was he, was he sort of a supercomputer? Yeah. A
machine, in other words. That's, well, that, but then he, uh, he had become more

36:22.100 --> 36:33.000
as, as, as the, when the world changed, uh, and these, the, the powers of magic and so on became effective, 
then he could be more than a machine.

36:35.200 --> 36:39.520
Just as a draught could be more than a dog and so on.

36:39.520 --> 36:47.120
So in other words, the change, in addition to, I think what it did was, was to alter the structure of atoms and so forth.

36:47.500 --> 36:52.460
Nuclear energy was impossible and magic came into being and so forth.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.600
So there were widespread changes.

36:55.480 --> 36:55.700
Yeah.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.660
And Ardna's...

36:56.660 --> 37:03.860
It's almost something like Larry Nibbins' magic goes away on the...

37:03.860 --> 37:04.320
Not quite.

37:05.020 --> 37:20.220
But at the end of that book, I got the impression that with the battle between Ardna and Orcus and I guess the annihilation of both, that magic and science or magic and technology now would both work or be blended in a new order of things.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.120
Yeah, that was the idea.

37:21.620 --> 37:28.820
The world was changing again and at least for a time, both of these kinds of powers would be functional.

37:30.340 --> 37:32.620
You said that that's been your biggest seller, Empire of the East?

37:33.220 --> 37:33.660
Yeah.

37:34.340 --> 37:35.060
Well, it's...

37:35.060 --> 37:44.280
Well, it hasn't been out in this form as long as some of the other books have, but it certainly, you know, certainly took off there, yeah.

37:46.280 --> 37:50.660
One thing I notice in the overall body of your work is your...

37:51.480 --> 37:53.880
What to me is an incredible flexibility.

37:54.380 --> 38:00.920
It seems to me like you write hard science fiction, you write science fantasy, you write social or soft science fiction.

38:01.460 --> 38:04.840
You write horror, I think, and specimens was sort of a horror story.

38:06.520 --> 38:11.500
Do these stories just come to you or do you deliberately set out to do different kinds of things?

38:12.260 --> 38:14.820
Oh, I set out to do different kinds of things, yeah.

38:16.220 --> 38:16.860
Deliberately, I mean.

38:16.900 --> 38:20.300
Oh, yeah, depending on what the idea is that you start with.

38:22.820 --> 38:27.860
I wouldn't want to do a hard science fiction story about Dracula.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.400
I think probably it would be impossible.

38:30.120 --> 38:43.260
So if you want to write about Dracula, you have to accept at least part of the rules of the supernatural story.

38:44.660 --> 38:47.900
What about that book when I enjoyed very much specimens?

38:49.080 --> 38:54.600
It seemed to me that that was an attempt to write a horror story with a haunted house and underneath.

38:54.780 --> 38:57.940
But it's also the science fiction at the end when you realize the creatures from outer space.

38:57.940 --> 39:05.480
Yeah, it was an attempt to write a good grade B movie plot and nobody has bought it yet to make a good grade B movie.

39:05.820 --> 39:11.300
But there's a new ace edition coming out in a few months here and maybe somebody will.

39:12.480 --> 39:18.060
But in other words, your intent was to, you know, the horror realm, to do something of that sort.

39:18.180 --> 39:25.320
Yeah, just kind of a fun story, if you can call it that, of menace to be overcome.

39:25.900 --> 39:31.080
The old house in the story, by the way, really exists in Lombard.

39:31.760 --> 39:40.180
When we were dead three years ago, when we lived in Chicago, we were looking for houses in the area there.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.320
And that was one that we looked at.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.260
Another one, another book too, that to me was...

39:47.260 --> 39:49.860
I don't know if the present owners have read the book or not, probably.

39:50.700 --> 39:51.280
Go ahead.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.680
Had I not known you had written it, I wouldn't have guessed you did.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.600
The Love Conquerors All.

39:59.620 --> 40:06.000
To me, that was sort of in the tradition of space merchants, social science fiction, extrapolating and current tendencies.

40:06.860 --> 40:10.560
What was it again, the origin, I guess, the impetus, the interest in that kind of thing?

40:10.560 --> 40:17.520
The impetus, I guess it was the controversy about abortion and sex.

40:18.980 --> 40:24.620
Things were bombarded, questions were faced with all the time here.

40:26.760 --> 40:33.780
And I just tried to, you know, the traditional science fiction writers viewpoint,

40:34.260 --> 40:40.320
take a look at everything, turn everything inside out and see how it looks from the other point of view.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.760
Would I misread that book to call it a dystopia?

40:46.980 --> 40:51.660
It certainly was not a very pleasant society, I guess.

40:53.960 --> 40:59.940
I don't know, it has not been one of my best-selling books, apparently.

41:00.160 --> 41:04.300
I was going to ask about reader response to that, how it had sold.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.200
It's not sold all that well, I don't know.

41:10.320 --> 41:14.180
I expect it's going to be kept in print, maybe with a different cover.

41:15.380 --> 41:18.620
Sometimes those things have an effect.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.240
I thought you had fun writing that.

41:20.720 --> 41:25.440
I enjoyed the way you would turn around, well, I don't know everything, the vocabulary,

41:25.800 --> 41:29.540
the little everyday expressions that people used based on this kind of society.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.420
Did you have fun constructing all of that and writing that?

41:31.420 --> 41:34.400
The word repression is almost an obscenity.

41:34.400 --> 41:38.460
And instead of curse words, you would use chastity or purity.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.660
Was that fun to dream all that up and write?

41:43.140 --> 41:49.660
I don't remember that as fun in the sense that Dracula tape was fun.

41:51.280 --> 41:59.620
It was more, I think I felt more seriously there that I was trying to get at something serious

41:59.620 --> 42:03.240
by approaching it in this backward way.

42:06.840 --> 42:12.520
In a sense, it's always fun to work at something you like to do.

42:15.220 --> 42:23.200
Would you say that of your work, that book might be the closest to having a message or a theme to it?

42:23.700 --> 42:30.720
Well, I hope it doesn't sound like a preachment of any kind, because that's pretty deadly.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.720
I suppose maybe it's...

42:36.220 --> 42:45.320
You get into the question of does art carry messages and is what we're doing art or what are we doing?

42:48.000 --> 42:52.420
Basically, I'm just trying to write what I think are good stories,

42:54.260 --> 42:57.580
and the rest of it take care of itself, I guess.

42:57.940 --> 43:01.460
The reason I ask, I guess I would have called the book satire in a lot of ways,

43:01.520 --> 43:07.260
and it seems to me a satirist almost by definition has a moral purpose, whether it's obvious or not.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.540
Would I be wrong in calling it satire in some ways?

43:14.860 --> 43:20.240
No, I think that's your department, really.

43:20.720 --> 43:26.020
Whether it's satire or what it is, I think as I said, I think I've done my job when I've written it.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.620
So I wouldn't say you're wrong.

43:31.180 --> 43:32.460
Classify it however you will.

43:33.620 --> 43:38.440
Okay, my favorite book of your work, this is just my personal opinion, is The Mask of the Sun.

43:39.620 --> 43:40.820
I enjoyed reading that very much.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.540
It seems to me you had to do... I don't know, maybe you are knowledgeable in the field,

43:46.600 --> 43:50.220
but did you have to do research on the Incas, the past, the culture you're writing about?

43:50.500 --> 43:53.300
I didn't actually go there. My wife has been there.

43:54.540 --> 43:58.140
She spent a little time in Peru before we were married,

43:58.840 --> 44:05.860
and she had some slides and some books and could answer some questions, and that helped a lot.

44:06.580 --> 44:19.720
I've never been there, but I was intrigued by this, what if possibility if the first Spanish expeditions of conquest had failed

44:19.720 --> 44:28.900
as they came so close to failing, several points, and we might have a situation where Peru would have turned out something like Japan

44:30.400 --> 44:40.600
being exposed to western civilization, but not overwhelmed by it, and going on developing their own way for hundreds of years afterward.

44:43.360 --> 44:48.980
Okay, that and Brother Assassin I think would be your major works which deal with time travel, right?

44:53.060 --> 44:55.040
I can't think of any other at the moment.

44:55.920 --> 45:02.700
Yeah, that's the... you use time travel simply as a science fiction device, an area of speculation,

45:02.960 --> 45:06.360
or is it something that you think has possibilities?

45:07.640 --> 45:11.200
Is any time travel work fantasy? I think Larry Niven said that.

45:11.460 --> 45:14.200
If you deal with time travel, you're dealing with fantasy because it's impossible.

45:16.320 --> 45:20.820
Well, I would hesitate to say what's physically ultimately impossible.

45:25.600 --> 45:35.280
I don't think we really begin to know yet what things the universe can produce in the way of just physical effects

45:35.280 --> 45:37.980
and conditions and so on.

45:41.620 --> 45:50.300
It's hard to see logically how a time travel story can be constructed

45:50.300 --> 45:54.640
because go back and murder your grandfather and all that cliches.

45:56.340 --> 46:01.580
But I think it's very useful as a device.

46:03.460 --> 46:10.660
I've just finished editing a book for Ace. It's called Spade Full of Spacetime.

46:12.980 --> 46:24.360
I have stories from 12, 13 different writers in there about probing the past, not by means of a time machine.

46:24.360 --> 46:31.100
I ruled out time machines and simply getting in your... whatever, and going back to an earlier year.

46:31.900 --> 46:44.120
I wanted people to, to think about, uh, scientific
investigations of the past and however, however they could, uh, could do it

46:44.120 --> 46:55.580
without, uh, without simply going back. And I think I got some very good stories
in there. Not quite as, as, uh, much hard science as I hope to get, but I think

46:55.580 --> 47:07.220
it'll be very interesting when, uh, when it comes out. Uh, when you start
writing a story, do you first develop the characters and then form the story

47:07.220 --> 47:18.140
around them or, uh, form the story and then develop the characters for it? Or
how do you do that? I think I have the story first. And somebody, uh, James

47:18.140 --> 47:27.380
Jones or somebody, I think, said that, uh, every writer has his stock company
of, of characters. They, it's like an actor, group of actors, they, they sort of

47:27.380 --> 47:38.960
change their names and, and faces a little bit and come on and perform. And I,
sometimes I suspect I have a, uh, I hope they're versatile. They don't, they

47:38.960 --> 47:50.440
don't always come out the same. But the, the idea comes first for the
characters, for me. How far ahead do you plan works in progress? Do you, what,

47:50.480 --> 47:59.920
do you have a list of works that you're going to write? Do you work by schedule
or by mood or? Well, I, I work by, uh, schedule when I have a chance and kids

47:59.920 --> 48:10.920
are all off at school. It's the best time. And, uh, I have, in the back of my
mind, I have a, uh, sort of a list of things to be done. And then I have things

48:10.920 --> 48:19.140
that I have contracted to do. And, of course, they have, that takes on a new
form of reality then. You have to really start at it. But there's no, seems to

48:19.140 --> 48:27.020
be no shortage of ideas. Are we still having one? Yeah. Why don't we check? Did
you drop on your tape? We just have a few more minutes. We're going to put on

48:27.020 --> 48:29.400
one more tape and catch a little bit more. Is that okay? Okay. Yeah.
