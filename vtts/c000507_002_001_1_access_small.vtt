WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:03.860
Okay, I guess the tape is rolling, so we might as well start.

00:05.880 --> 00:10.960
First of all, I wondered how you became involved in science fiction when you were younger.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.340
Did you read it a lot when you were young?

00:13.280 --> 00:18.400
Yes, I started reading science fiction, I suppose, about the earliest form of literature

00:18.400 --> 00:19.160
that I read.

00:19.840 --> 00:28.780
I never made a mental distinction between science fiction, fantasy, anything of that

00:28.780 --> 00:36.000
nature because my parents brought it to me to read and I just simply regarded it as the

00:36.000 --> 00:39.380
most interesting reading material that I had accessible.

00:41.160 --> 00:46.540
So naturally when I began turning to writing, that's what I wrote.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.600
Why did you start writing science fiction?

00:54.260 --> 00:57.240
Well, actually they took my television program off the air.

00:59.340 --> 01:05.780
Our television, at that time I was ten, television hadn't been around in private homes very long.

01:06.480 --> 01:11.980
I had just time enough to get thoroughly addicted to television science fiction and then it

01:11.980 --> 01:14.420
ran at this course and it was gone from the air.

01:14.720 --> 01:21.060
So I, you know, set up a morning and went into the bedroom, picked up a tablet and pencil

01:21.060 --> 01:22.640
and started writing my own novels.

01:25.700 --> 01:30.580
Your first published novel, I think, was the 1976, The Gate of Iporell?

01:30.780 --> 01:31.600
Yes, yes.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.560
Have you published any stories before then?

01:35.180 --> 01:41.380
No, not for one of trying, but I've never regarded myself as a short story writer.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.280
I don't tend to think in that convenient length.

01:46.920 --> 01:58.240
Consequently, I wrote novels and novels and novels and was actually turned in Brothers

01:58.240 --> 02:04.500
of Earth first and since there seemed to be some question about it being a little long

02:05.100 --> 02:15.260
as many of my works didn't be, I very, very quickly wrote Gate of Iporell while I was

02:15.280 --> 02:19.860
teaching school, etc. and managed to get it finished inside two months.

02:23.600 --> 02:30.480
One thing I wondered is, you said that you didn't distinguish between science fiction

02:30.480 --> 02:35.360
and the other reading that you did, but I wonder why you didn't do some other kind of

02:35.360 --> 02:36.900
writing instead of science fiction?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.540
I think you could have been a writer in almost any area that you tried.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.720
Why? I don't write the other things because I don't like them in general.

02:46.280 --> 02:53.700
I find that, I suppose the only thing outside of science fiction that I've ever tried in

02:53.700 --> 02:59.420
my hand at writing has been mystery and I don't care for the modern fashion of the

02:59.420 --> 03:06.760
novels and I've always viewed them as a great deal more fun to read than they are to write

03:07.820 --> 03:15.620
mostly because you have to be extremely controlled and I suspect that mystery writers have to

03:15.620 --> 03:20.240
know who did it and I'd rather not know the end of my books.

03:22.820 --> 03:29.200
The other thing that I've tried in my hand at is historical fiction and I find again that

03:29.200 --> 03:33.200
the straight jacket because you're rather well held with what happened whether or not

03:33.200 --> 03:34.560
it makes artistic sense.

03:36.160 --> 03:40.220
So just for the sheer pleasure of writing I prefer science fiction.

03:42.520 --> 03:46.560
Okay, was it Donnie Wilhelm that published that first book?

03:47.020 --> 03:47.520
Yes it was.

03:49.520 --> 03:55.020
Have you established any contact or made any attempts or was that the first one that you'd sent out?

03:55.020 --> 04:00.360
No, you mean with other publishing houses and what have you?

04:00.840 --> 04:02.260
No, with Don Wilhelm.

04:02.960 --> 04:13.820
Well actually I grew fascinated with Walheim as an editor because I had gone through my library

04:13.820 --> 04:19.420
finally after seven years of trying to sell things and I thought well there must be a system to this.

04:19.420 --> 04:26.700
You see I had no professional help at all and I began searching my library to see what editor had published

04:26.700 --> 04:34.120
the majority of works and writers that I liked figuring that we might have something in common as far as taste goes.

04:34.920 --> 04:47.200
So I began researching Don Wilhelm to see what his preferences were, where we differed and where we were similar

04:47.200 --> 04:55.360
and so I began to conclude more and more that we were fairly well syntactical when it came to taste.

04:55.740 --> 05:00.640
Not quite the same all the way down the line but generally there's a broad area of overlap.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.480
So I found him very easy to work with.

05:06.980 --> 05:10.300
Okay I just had one more question on your back and so forth.

05:12.580 --> 05:20.560
Do you identify or do you think there are any influences either writers or anything in your back?

05:20.600 --> 05:24.500
I guess in terms of science fiction writers that had any influence on you in the way you write?

05:26.060 --> 05:34.340
Well it's very difficult to pin it down because I am one of the most Catholic science fiction readers you're likely to find.

05:34.420 --> 05:37.900
I read everything I can get my hands on and always have on the speed reader.

05:38.900 --> 05:48.880
But classically speaking I suppose that our Puglius Virgilius Morrow is one of the outstanding influences on my writing

05:48.880 --> 05:55.420
simply because he's one writer that I spent an enormous amount of time with, at least historically speaking,

05:56.720 --> 05:59.160
when I was doing my studies.

06:00.260 --> 06:05.740
In terms of science fiction writers that have had a great deal of influence on me,

06:05.860 --> 06:22.760
I can remember some of the early works that I read were Heinlein, Asimov, Norton, Harry Bates, Howard, Robert Howard.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.620
It was very difficult in the town that I grew up in to find any science fiction.

06:27.820 --> 06:33.220
Jack Williamson was one and Edgar Rice Burroughs and so on.

06:35.220 --> 06:43.940
By the time that, you see I kept getting run out of the store they would locate a juvenile back there in the science fiction section

06:43.940 --> 06:52.720
and immediately they would begin to suggest that possibly I should be looking at the Dick and Jane novels somewhere else.

06:53.660 --> 07:02.700
So I did have a little difficulty with the library and in bookstores trying to get out with science fiction books undetected.

07:05.440 --> 07:11.960
Okay, I think you said you'd sent out a Written Brothers of Earth before Gated of Ibrell,

07:12.040 --> 07:18.440
but I still wanted to ask why you so early got into writing the, I guess I would call it heroic fantasy,

07:18.540 --> 07:23.760
I'm not sure that's how you'd identify the Gated of Ibrell, but why did you sort of begin with that kind of a...

07:24.440 --> 07:29.500
Well, I didn't. They weren't the first books that I had written.

07:30.580 --> 07:39.180
There are others which are tentative efforts that didn't pan out in one way or another.

07:39.200 --> 07:45.520
Everybody, I won't say everybody, but a majority of writers tend to have them.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.340
My first love is really technology.

07:48.340 --> 08:01.760
The only thing is that I had been out of the technological mainstream while they had made numerous scientific advances that I was not current with.

08:02.440 --> 08:13.860
And it annoys me a great deal to feel that I'm writing something that is not technically accurate, or that I have glossed over something.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.960
It irritates me personally to postulate, well, for instance, we have a gravity field here which keeps everyone's feet on the deck.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.040
I want to know how it works.

08:27.880 --> 08:34.920
So, consequently, I wrote heroic fantasy while I was doing a great deal of reading in Scientific American.

08:35.960 --> 08:49.220
Also, heroic fantasy is an area where I have a good deal of expertise since I have a major in classics, history, archaeology, anthropology, this sort of thing.

08:49.880 --> 08:58.060
But I had always been a sort of a hobbyist and a little more than a hobbyist since it was one of my fields in the history of technology.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.200
Okay, I'm not sure I'm going to pronounce some of these names right.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.420
So after I hear you pronounce them, we'll get them right when we do the show.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.500
But I guess it's Morgane.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.240
I still have a little puzzlement about her.

09:17.420 --> 09:23.500
Was she a creature or a force existing before the call or the call?

09:23.640 --> 09:24.660
I'm not sure how that's pronounced.

09:25.340 --> 09:38.180
Well, actually, there's some of this that I'm not about to give away as regards to the history of Morgane because that it gets into the possibility of a book that I'm working on at the moment.

09:38.760 --> 09:46.420
The first set of the books, the gate books, involves much more the character of Vanya, who is a medieval man.

09:47.660 --> 10:00.800
I have to take his viewpoint or they cease to be heroic fantasy and they begin to be a science fiction novel, pure and simple, because Morgane is far more technologically sophisticated than he is.

10:00.920 --> 10:05.180
And if it were told from her viewpoint, it would begin to be a thing of numbers and calculus.

10:08.420 --> 10:12.560
Morgane is far more advanced, exactly where she comes from and what she is.

10:12.700 --> 10:22.640
I've preferred to leave to the reader's estimation, although I will say that your surmises are fairly well down the center.

10:24.740 --> 10:28.400
Okay, that's why I wasn't sure. I thought maybe I'd missed something. I thought you were being a little ambiguous.

10:28.400 --> 10:43.500
It is deliberately vague, partially because the character of Morgane has evolved as I've done it, also partially because I have wished to keep those books as heroic fantasy.

10:44.380 --> 10:56.480
For the reason that the technology of the gates is so vague that, again, I prefer to know how things work and since that one is far more fantastical than some of the other technology I work with, I prefer to keep it in the realm of fantasy.

10:58.700 --> 11:03.180
Okay, you also just said that you might be working where you are working on some more books that might involve that material.

11:03.400 --> 11:07.840
I was going to ask, did you, when you started the first book, did you have the idea of a trilogy?

11:09.080 --> 11:21.020
No, actually the first book, Quit, where it quit, except that they had been entered into the books and print of the series, which rather surprised me.

11:21.020 --> 11:24.380
And so I thought, well, why not?

11:26.240 --> 11:38.200
For a little while I found it relaxing and to a certain extent still do, to alternate both my reading and my writing of hard tech with fantasy,

11:38.480 --> 11:48.240
because I do produce at an enormous rate compared to some other writers who may labor one or two years on a book.

11:49.800 --> 11:55.540
Well, a good deal of anyone working on a book for one or two years is not writing time, it's thinking time.

11:56.940 --> 12:04.760
And because physically to write it down takes a precious little while, you can write any given book down in less than a month, you could just think of that.

12:05.940 --> 12:14.140
So I found that to give my imagination a rest, as it were, it does really help to shift gears between books.

12:14.140 --> 12:20.000
That's why I tend to do things which are radically different one from the other.

12:20.180 --> 12:35.660
I may worry over a similar theme, I may do it once in science fiction and once in fantasy, thus providing endless amusement or fodder for reviewers who are trying to find some sort of a common theme.

12:35.660 --> 12:42.680
Well, basically it's just that I just finished working with that and was still rattling around in my head, so I did it in a different medium,

12:42.680 --> 12:49.000
just as an artist tends to paint a lot in blue because that's the color they had last on their palette.

12:49.740 --> 13:03.180
There's any particularly deep significance to some of these similarities, just that some of the works were done in sort of opposition to each other, different types, different styles.

13:05.660 --> 13:09.920
Was there any reader response that made you continue with that series?

13:10.380 --> 13:12.520
Well, there has been a great deal of reader response.

13:13.580 --> 13:22.000
I think that I had a great deal of fun writing it.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.320
I look back on it and decide I had a great deal of fun writing it.

13:27.320 --> 13:36.080
Sometimes the character of Morgane irritated me so much that I was just about ready to give up, throw in the towel while I was creating it.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.100
I think I tend to sympathize much more with Vanya.

13:42.180 --> 13:53.280
But yes, there has been a very strong reader response to it and I've always had a really great affection for this trilogy myself.

13:53.280 --> 14:01.540
It's one of the few works that I have really felt that I could go back to and possibly do another three books.

14:05.020 --> 14:18.680
Usually when you've written three books on anything, you tend to be burned out on it because while the reader may devour it in a single night or series of nights and it's gone for the writer,

14:19.320 --> 14:26.620
you had to live with it constantly for the better part of the year on each segment.

14:29.430 --> 14:37.820
For some curious reason, the more game books are one of the only ones that I really find easy to return to.

14:39.980 --> 14:45.540
You mentioned that Vanya was a medieval man and of course heroic fantasy.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.180
I guess a lot of the elements go back to the medieval formulas.

14:49.300 --> 15:06.700
But it seems to me that you have in some ways reversed the normal formula in making the heroic part of the book, the woman, and her sidekick, but her helper, I guess the male.

15:06.700 --> 15:13.520
I heard some readers respond that they were not surprised at that, but it was a little unusual to have the male in that position.

15:14.300 --> 15:26.040
Well, I think that there is some literary tradition for it. The notion of courtly love, I suppose, is one possibility.

15:28.520 --> 15:51.240
There is also the fact that in terms of the age at which those characters were created, I had really conceived those characters when I was about probably fourteen.

15:53.120 --> 16:00.720
Again, I think the reason why it's much easier for me to return to those is because they almost come out of my extreme youth.

16:01.720 --> 16:06.940
I suppose one always has an affection for things of that sort. They are sort of archetypal with us.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.900
In one form or another, they are very early creations of mine.

16:14.520 --> 16:23.320
As such, that was the time at which I was really just beginning to toy with being able to do male characters at all.

16:24.520 --> 16:34.580
Of course, the version that is in print was done completely separate from any of the earlier works.

16:34.580 --> 16:45.140
I didn't look at or refer to the earlier works when I did Gator Vigrell. I just sort of remembered it a long time ago.

16:45.260 --> 16:50.540
But I suppose that's the reason that the characters formed the way they did.

16:50.540 --> 17:04.400
There is also the fact that, I think, that it, artistically, to me, made a fairly interesting story in terms of the relationship between the two characters.

17:04.800 --> 17:12.040
The fact that Zanya's best-setting sin, if you will, is arrogance, pride, and temper.

17:13.300 --> 17:24.000
If you can conceive of any situation for a medieval man in which arrogance, pride, and temper are going to get a little frayed, it's this sort of situation.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.980
Okay. I'm going to go ahead and move on to a whole new topic.

17:32.420 --> 17:40.160
I think one of the things that impressed me the most, and I'm sure it impresses most of your readers greatly, is your construction of alien cultures.

17:42.100 --> 17:49.380
I was curious as to whether you use models or analogs for them, or do you create them out of thin air?

17:51.240 --> 17:58.220
Yes and no and both. One of my areas of study, as aforementioned, is anthropology.

17:59.860 --> 18:12.580
I've also done a great deal of study in ecology, biology, genetics, although strictly as an amateur in that field because it is very complex.

18:16.800 --> 18:32.880
In a way, I do take some items from the knowledge that I have of earthly animals, cultures, communities, ecosystems, and so on.

18:33.800 --> 18:54.980
But most of my knowledge of human culture is, again, rather strange in that I know the prehistoric or bronze age that holds span up to the Iron Age much better than I do, say, later periods.

18:56.220 --> 19:22.120
So a great deal of what I know about human history is so basic or lies so far back down the time track that a divergence from what happened at any given point is going to produce massive alterations in an urban culture much further along the line.

19:23.280 --> 19:35.280
Consequently, for instance, when I did the Fated Sun novels, which are basically a desert culture, I did not pattern it off any modern desert culture about which I know, frankly, nothing.

19:36.280 --> 19:59.120
I patterned it strictly by taking what I know about desert survival and earlier nomadic cultures here on earth contrived a biology that would work under the extreme conditions that I postulated.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.180
And then green elements from here and there.

20:04.160 --> 20:13.340
It's very strange that I now get letters from people that say that it very closely resembles a modern terrestrial nomadic culture.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.940
But this is strictly a surprise to me.

20:17.120 --> 20:22.600
I suppose it just says that I knew something about the very ancient ones.

20:29.120 --> 20:41.480
Why does then, I guess in many of your books, I would even say the majority, you somehow in the book have a theme or a motif of alien human closeness.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.620
You know, sometimes your humans have actually become part of an alien civilization.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.640
If they don't, at least they become very close to it.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.660
Why does that fascinate you so much?

20:54.240 --> 21:02.820
Well, partly I suppose it's what I said earlier that one tends to toss one idea around until you've got that color completely off your palate.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.780
I don't know how long it will continue to fascinate me.

21:07.900 --> 21:12.640
I suppose there's a limit to how much one can say about any given thing.

21:13.980 --> 21:17.540
And not all of my novels involve aliens.

21:18.020 --> 21:24.060
Among those novels I count some that are not yet published but are only partially complete.

21:24.060 --> 21:29.360
If I say that I have about 13 works in progress at the moment, you may understand.

21:32.540 --> 21:37.600
So what is on the stands is sort of the tip of the iceberg, at least as far as my body at work.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.180
But indeed I do a great deal of it.

21:41.180 --> 21:49.100
I think part of the fascination for it lies in the fact that I myself have been a lifelong student of cultures.

21:50.020 --> 21:57.720
And if there's anything that I can conceive of that is slightly stranger than being lost in Greece and unable to speak the local dialect,

21:58.300 --> 22:04.720
it's being lost somewhere else and in even worse shape and managed, managing to survive it.

22:05.340 --> 22:13.880
It pleases me also because it is a type of conflict that one can develop that does not involve necessarily everyone taking sides,

22:13.940 --> 22:18.660
lining up and starting to shoot at each other, although this sometimes does happen.

22:20.820 --> 22:23.860
It is a way to...it's sort of like the man against nature story.

22:24.040 --> 22:28.860
You have a very exciting story about a man who is simply trying to survive in a hostile environment.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.860
Well, some environments don't involve icebergs, they involve cities.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.860
They involve cultures that you've never met before.

22:37.580 --> 22:49.640
And I do hope, just as a matter of practical philosophy, that one thing this age of ours has begun to produce is an understanding in the human race

22:49.640 --> 22:56.220
that we can not only get along with each other, we can get along with other creatures on the same planet.

22:56.220 --> 23:01.960
Perhaps it is the final lesson that any species learns before they are fit to set foot in space.

23:02.660 --> 23:08.960
At least I hope this is the case, which may guarantee the peaceful intention of potential neighbors.

23:10.780 --> 23:14.240
I think you've sort of answered my next question, which was going to be,

23:15.380 --> 23:19.520
if you deliberately counterpointed alien and human cultures,

23:21.340 --> 23:27.840
you just suggested there would be a value to that, that we should learn to live with other species and so forth.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.760
That would be a fair statement that you do counterpoint deliberately.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.780
Yes, one of the most difficult things on the face of the earth, for instance,

23:38.080 --> 23:43.900
is for two people who do not speak each other's language well to communicate.

23:43.900 --> 23:53.400
It's also certainly true as diplomats have discovered for centuries that you can speak someone else's language perfectly

23:53.400 --> 24:01.940
and still have trouble getting your point across, simply because language extends into time, history,

24:02.760 --> 24:09.820
and accumulated meanings, as well as it does just the present meanings which are contained in the dictionary.

24:09.820 --> 24:20.060
Context and history have a great bearing on language, so that when you begin to talk about the difficulties

24:20.060 --> 24:27.260
of communicating species to species where you may even have a totally different psychology,

24:28.180 --> 24:30.120
your problems are much more severe.

24:30.900 --> 24:38.800
It is also an area of ongoing research in the scientific community of the studies that are done with primates,

24:38.800 --> 24:41.580
the studies that are done with dolphins and with whales.

24:43.580 --> 24:50.880
Mankind as a whole, outside of the science fiction field, is finally beginning to wake up to the fact

24:50.880 --> 24:57.340
that you do not necessarily have to think like a human being to be, quote, intelligent.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.900
That intelligence is a function of many different things.

25:01.820 --> 25:11.480
Anyone who has ever taught in school will rapidly come to the conclusion that intelligence is not a quantity

25:11.480 --> 25:13.700
that can be neatly assessed.

25:14.500 --> 25:22.840
It has to do with the spatial perceptions in relationships, with the ability to compare and to analyze.

25:23.100 --> 25:26.160
Human intelligence is made up of many, many different factors.

25:26.160 --> 25:35.160
One may be particularly gifted in one or more of them, not so gifted in others, and it makes for a great range of abilities.

25:35.700 --> 25:40.880
Even more so when you're dealing with different species who may have completely different environments,

25:42.740 --> 25:50.880
whose visual range may be different, some may see for instance into the infrared,

25:52.700 --> 25:58.740
some may hear sounds which are not audible, so on and so forth, just biologically speaking.

25:59.280 --> 26:06.860
So you may have a psychology and a history that are very, very different from anything that we're anticipating,

26:06.860 --> 26:09.100
simply because of a biological barrier.

26:12.180 --> 26:15.100
Okay, I guess I'll just move on to a question.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.580
The question is on a few of your works.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.320
Obviously I'm not going to be able to hit all of your works.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.320
We don't have time to do that, but there were a few of them I wanted to single out.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.400
I think it's pronounced the pride of Chen'er.

26:25.600 --> 26:25.880
Chen'er.

26:26.080 --> 26:26.500
Chen'er.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.160
The pride of Chen'er.

26:29.320 --> 26:35.160
Okay, let me just ask you this question first of all.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.180
Is it the honey?

26:36.820 --> 26:37.300
Honey.

26:39.100 --> 26:46.780
I somehow received the impression their society, their physical makeup was in some ways based on lions.

26:47.140 --> 26:47.780
Yes, absolutely.

26:49.320 --> 27:02.340
This is one case where I've taken the species of lions and in a very simple way devised a culture of an advanced species

27:02.340 --> 27:11.560
which very closely parallels the biology and if you will, social patterns of a lion pride.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.660
The title of the book of course is a three-way pun.

27:17.660 --> 27:23.940
Meaning the pride of lions, the pride of the race and the name of the ship.

27:24.240 --> 27:24.960
And the ship, yes.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.620
Out of which are involved together.

27:28.740 --> 27:33.400
And also that would be why the females are the ones who go space faring and the males stay at home.

27:33.640 --> 27:38.640
Yes, among the lions you will notice it is the females who do the hunting.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.480
Okay, I'm proud of myself.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.220
I figured that out.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.860
Tally, they're the human in that book.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.060
Of course he is totally alone.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.460
He's a very pitiful creature.

27:51.700 --> 27:54.140
You know, the only one of his kind I guess until the end of the book.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.200
Very unheroic.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.960
And you know, it's a while.

28:00.780 --> 28:06.680
All of a sudden I realize I'm reading the book from an alien point of view and here's a human being and I'm feeling sorry for him which is unusual.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.960
I guess I was just for the line of the story.

28:12.200 --> 28:16.040
Do you do that on purpose to give us a different perspective on humanity?

28:16.540 --> 28:19.420
Have you ever seen a baboon react to a leopard?

28:20.420 --> 28:20.640
No.

28:20.860 --> 28:23.420
It's raw terror.

28:24.300 --> 28:29.760
A primate nervous system is not really set up to be setting in the center of a pride of lions.

28:31.060 --> 28:41.820
It's really one of the most unkind things I believe that you could do to a human being as far as social patterns would be to drop them right into the middle of a feline culture.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.640
Because the moves are all wrong.

28:48.180 --> 28:53.700
Well for instance, Tally being a primate smiles.

28:55.020 --> 28:57.740
And of course this is exactly the wrong thing to do.

28:57.860 --> 28:59.560
You know what a lion does when it smiles.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.000
It's not a friendly gesture.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.860
Every gesture he makes is wrong.

29:05.880 --> 29:11.620
Every gesture they make is wrong at least as far as he's concerned.

29:12.220 --> 29:18.220
He is however a very heroic human being if you just simply analyze what he has done.

29:19.420 --> 29:23.920
He has managed to survive a very horrendous situation.

29:24.760 --> 29:30.880
He has managed to collect himself with some dignity out of a situation which would have broken drastically.

29:32.420 --> 29:36.800
Any average individual would have definitely come out of it damaged.

29:38.400 --> 29:49.160
He's been forced to take horrendous decisions and he's been dumped into a situation where even his personal value is of some question.

29:50.380 --> 30:02.980
And yet he manages to stand up on his own feet and confront the honey captain with a here I am come and see if you can do something about it kind of attitude.

30:02.980 --> 30:07.980
Which is of course what wins the captain's respect in the beginning.

30:08.940 --> 30:25.980
He calms down a little bit as you will see when he begins trying to deal with and doing what any sensible person would do when confronted with a situation where you suspect that the beings around you are at least essentially friendly.

30:25.980 --> 30:32.460
And there's no need to provoking something that would be a total misunderstanding.

30:33.280 --> 30:45.360
So he does remain a little bit quiet but he's quiet partially because he's smart and is trying to absorb more data than he gets out.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.220
Okay I see that now.

30:49.680 --> 30:55.200
I suppose yeah in terms of what where he was I guess he was sort of courageous individual.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.440
Let me move on for just a second to down below station.

31:01.020 --> 31:06.640
The plotting and the setting of that novel has impressed me a great deal.

31:06.640 --> 31:18.000
Did you use a strict extrapolation to devise the society and the company and the merchants and the way you set that book up?

31:19.520 --> 31:23.660
Yes I follow the NASA reports.

31:25.360 --> 31:33.400
I'm a great supporter of the space program and I do follow it very very closely.

31:33.400 --> 31:45.780
And one of the things that has always interested me is the economic mechanisms, the reason for going into space, the reason for colonization.

31:46.760 --> 32:00.600
I also recall being taught some rather inaccurate things when I was back in primer school about the altruistic motives for colonization.

32:01.000 --> 32:14.120
To hear some of the old tales I heard the Greeks all went out and colonized the Mediterranean just because it was there or just because they felt it would be a noble thing to do.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.660
Which is very far from the truth, it was economic necessity.

32:19.900 --> 32:24.480
Many of them were getting out of Greece because the pressures at home were incredible.

32:26.220 --> 32:43.560
In this particular instance I simply took the situation that we presently have and as a background for the novel I simply extrapolated our present situation for over a couple of hundred years.

32:45.220 --> 33:00.600
This is pretty well what I see going on based on modern economic necessity and a little bit of altruism in the sense that science and science for the sake of science will continue.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.500
If you like we've already launched the first star probe.

33:04.300 --> 33:11.740
Our problem is that right now we haven't got the budget or the research to enable them to do a loop and come back to us.

33:12.300 --> 33:18.500
But I imagine that early in the next century there will be such probes launched.

33:20.480 --> 33:24.220
Was that more difficult to plot and harder to write than your others?

33:24.560 --> 33:26.380
It was a bear. It really was.

33:27.100 --> 33:34.800
I think because it was sort of a collection of all the things that I had been trying to do up to that point.

33:34.940 --> 33:40.360
All the research, all the reading that I had been doing and trying to rationalize this universe at mine.

33:41.400 --> 33:45.780
To give it some sort of scientific accuracy.

33:46.720 --> 33:50.020
The one thing you have to grant me is faster than light travel.

33:50.520 --> 33:57.600
Everything else I designed is at least within near reach of our capabilities.

34:01.740 --> 34:11.120
The plot is necessarily complex because we're dealing here with the future of the human race.

34:12.720 --> 34:18.420
The human race is actually the character in this novel in one odd sense.

34:19.720 --> 34:24.320
There are a number of specimens of it who are not too nice.

34:25.340 --> 34:32.500
Fortunately there are some who are at least in my own estimation good people.

34:33.860 --> 34:41.140
The novel follows the activities of a great many of them at a very hazardous moment for humanity.

34:41.880 --> 34:46.320
Part of humanity is literally breaking free of earth.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.420
Never to come back again.

34:50.040 --> 34:58.540
In which another portion of humanity is trying to retain their heritage.

34:59.240 --> 35:03.840
And to try to reach an accommodation between what they were and what they are.

35:04.900 --> 35:14.620
And manage to deal with the new realities that they're meeting at the same time.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.260
This probably isn't a fair question to ask an author.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.940
I've had a number of them say make up your own mind.

35:25.020 --> 35:29.630
In terms of who you side with, if you side with anybody, I was probably more...

35:30.200 --> 35:33.040
I identified more with Cygni Mallory than anybody in the book.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.740
Would that be anywhere near what you intended?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.320
To a certain extent, yes.

35:38.320 --> 35:44.900
Cygni Mallory is a very enigmatic individual in some ways.

35:45.900 --> 35:51.120
She's difficult even for her creator to get a handle on.

35:52.140 --> 35:54.520
There are a number of things going on with her.

35:55.240 --> 36:04.660
To a certain extent, it disturbs me that she is as heroic as she is.

36:04.660 --> 36:11.760
Because when you analyze what she does, you really have to line her up on the side of the not nice people.

36:14.340 --> 36:20.820
On the other hand, if you got into an argument with her on morality,

36:22.160 --> 36:28.560
she would point to the morality that created the ghastly situation on the station.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.640
And ask who got the better results.

36:34.080 --> 36:39.760
So Mallory is forever dealing in very, very uncomfortable paradoxes.

36:39.920 --> 36:43.840
Often even the author does not like what Mallory does.

36:44.500 --> 36:49.860
But sometimes it is the most direct solution that saves the greatest number of lives.

36:51.480 --> 36:56.580
She is, as I say, sort of an uncomfortable figure.

36:57.260 --> 37:03.280
As that history of that world develops in subsequent books,

37:05.700 --> 37:12.620
I think it will become clear that Mallory's influence persists among those people,

37:12.840 --> 37:14.680
and it is not always a wholesome one.

37:15.600 --> 37:20.920
Mallory, as Mallory, can be a very palatable, very appealing individual.

37:20.920 --> 37:25.700
The problem is that some people persist in following her policies,

37:26.940 --> 37:29.140
and come to less happy results.

37:31.180 --> 37:37.320
So it is a kind of a novel that lays the foundation for a good many things.

37:38.020 --> 37:44.020
And for instance, the security organization in The Fated Sun,

37:44.840 --> 37:48.640
the rather sinister daegas I believe his name is,

37:49.960 --> 37:52.900
is several centuries down the road Mallory's creation.

37:56.300 --> 37:58.700
Okay, that's interesting. I was just going to move on to that.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.700
Let me give you one more question on Down Below Station.

38:01.820 --> 38:04.300
Well, in fact, it applies to Fated Sun too, in a couple of your other books.

38:05.120 --> 38:08.620
You've already mentioned the fact that we have to give you the faster-than-light travel.

38:11.000 --> 38:16.220
Still, concerning the so-called jump in the space battles in Down Below Station,

38:17.300 --> 38:20.880
I don't think I've read any more convincing space battles than those.

38:23.860 --> 38:27.040
And the faster-than-light travel, the jump and so forth,

38:27.600 --> 38:32.460
you didn't make any attempt at all to, I guess you can't back it up or prove anything there,

38:32.540 --> 38:37.540
but there was enough science behind that, or I don't know how you did it when it was convincing.

38:39.060 --> 38:44.260
Well, I worked very hard at it. I always loved Doc Smith.

38:47.220 --> 38:58.500
And one of the things that I always felt that I would like to bring back to the field of science fiction, if I could, was the, was the space yarn.

38:59.260 --> 39:06.860
I mean, for a long time now, science fiction, we've been on planets, we've built cities, we've gotten so earthbound

39:06.860 --> 39:15.680
that a lot of the romance of space flight itself has gone unexpressed in literature.

39:16.620 --> 39:28.000
And I wished to be able to develop a mechanism which would enable me to write oddly enough after working my brains out on it,

39:28.480 --> 39:34.020
this simple kind of story that I used to enjoy when I was young.

39:35.080 --> 39:44.800
And I suddenly realized that I was in up to my neck in relativistic time, all sorts of things.

39:45.480 --> 39:55.620
One of the things that fascinated me when I began to work out the battles, and even there I took some shortcuts as anyone who wants to get in and argue it,

39:55.740 --> 40:00.580
I will freely admit that there were some things I had to do for artistic value.

40:02.240 --> 40:10.100
But one of the things that I began to discover was that in terms of being on one of those ships in the battle,

40:10.680 --> 40:16.520
that suddenly in a very practical way I was up against the Einsteinian stoppage of time.

40:17.980 --> 40:26.400
Because when you are traveling near sea, near the speed of light, aboard one of those ships, all time has stopped.

40:26.400 --> 40:33.500
You exist at one moment, traveling forever. If you send a message, it can go no faster than you do.

40:34.180 --> 40:36.460
You and that message will arrive at the same time.

40:36.780 --> 40:46.480
So essentially you exist in a frozen segment of time, an event horizon which is perpetuating itself across the system in which you're operating.

40:47.520 --> 40:57.560
And I began to find that a rather mind-bending concept, particularly when I was trying to plot out the strategy.

40:58.780 --> 41:05.960
If your enemy exists as an event horizon, and you exist as another one, how thick and few are going to figure out where he is.

41:08.840 --> 41:11.960
Okay, listen, David has to flip the tape about something.
