Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.900 --> 00:34.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.720
And here are your hosts.

00:43.760 --> 00:52.000
This is David Carson. And David Crews. Few characters in either science fiction
or fantasy have been as fascinating to readers as Conan the Barbarian. Conan is

00:52.000 --> 00:59.940
the creation of Robert E. Howard, a writer of the 1930s who lived in Cross
Plains, Texas. Howard filled the pulp magazines of his day with westerns,

01:00.100 --> 01:07.680
detective stories, horror stories, science fantasy, just about anything that
would sell. But he became best known for his tales of heroic fantasy,

01:07.920 --> 01:16.660
particularly the ones that involved Conan. Conan was a giant barbarian who lived
a swashbuckling life in the mythical Hyborian age that Howard created. There is

01:16.660 --> 01:25.680
nothing fancy or subtle about Conan. He survives and flourishes by pure muscle
and swordplay. Howard's writing was colorful and exciting and perfectly matched

01:25.680 --> 01:26.160
his hero.

01:32.100 --> 01:40.560
Howard committed suicide in 1936 at the age of 30. He left a number of
unfinished Conan manuscripts and story ideas. And the character of Conan was so

01:40.560 --> 01:49.080
appealing to readers that authors have recently been writing new material on him
or finishing Howard's own incomplete stories. Noted science fiction and fantasy

01:49.080 --> 01:57.000
author L. Sprague de Camp has written Conan stories and become interested enough
in Howard's life to write a biography of him. We asked de Camp if Howard was

01:57.000 --> 02:06.420
anything like Conan. Well, everybody knows that Conan is an idealization of
Howard. In other words, the kind of person that Howard thought he would have

02:06.420 --> 02:22.640
liked to have been the ruthless, domineering, footloose, irresponsible
adventurer. Actually, Robert was no respecter of laws and regulations. But the

02:22.640 --> 02:33.180
key word here is idealization. De Camp says Howard and Conan were nothing alike.
Actually, Robert was just the opposite type. Except for hot tempers and

02:33.180 --> 02:48.980
chivalrous attitude toward women, they had nothing in common. Robert, Howard,
was shy, bookish, compassionate, extremely polite.

02:54.140 --> 03:08.160
And socially timid. And he's so law-abiding that he wouldn't cut across the
neighbor's lot even, although everybody else across the lanes did. He was just

03:08.160 --> 03:18.780
about as different from the character Conan in the stories as a person could be.
De Camp believes Howard yearned to live in a past age, some more heroic time

03:18.780 --> 03:29.960
than the present. Well, Robert was always talking a lot about how he wished that
he thought he'd have been really in his element if he'd been born on the Texan

03:29.960 --> 03:43.280
frontier in the 19th century or in some barbarian society like the ancient Gauls
or Goths or somebody. Well, I think he'd have had a very unpleasant surprise

03:43.280 --> 03:58.520
because it wasn't his temperament at all. He was a shy, bookish introvert.
Finally, De Camp reveals that Howard had a serious mental problem. He had an

03:58.520 --> 04:09.660
outsized monkey on his back and he was doomed from some way back. He'd planned
his suicide ever since he was a little boy. He told his mother when he was a

04:09.660 --> 04:19.960
little kitty that, Mama, when you die, I want to die with you. And the foolish
woman, I think, probably sort of giggled and encouraged him. It was long planned

04:19.960 --> 04:28.680
and several people knew about it, but they didn't do anything. The only thing
you could have done with Robert was if you'd gotten him to a good shrink early

04:28.680 --> 04:39.360
enough, quite a good many years before he actually killed himself, why,
something might have been done. But that, of course, is uncertain. Howard wrote

04:39.360 --> 04:48.820
some 21 Conan stories, most of which appeared in Weird Tales in the 1930s. Only
one novel, Conan the Conqueror, was published, and that was some time after

04:48.820 --> 04:51.740
Howard's death. More next time about Robert E. Howard.

04:59.180 --> 05:07.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:07.040 --> 05:07.800
Odessa, Texas.

05:52.940 --> 05:56.900
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.660 --> 06:18.040
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.440
And here are your hosts.

06:27.060 --> 06:35.400
This is David Crews and David Carson. There are subcategories coming under the
general headings of science fiction and fantasy. One of the most popular these

06:35.400 --> 06:44.040
days is heroic fantasy. It's sometimes called sword and sorcery, a term that
almost serves as a definition for the genre. It deals with heroic barbarians

06:44.040 --> 06:52.740
swinging large bloody swords and sorcerers conjuring up all manner of demons.
And as we've said, it's popular nowadays, particularly the Conan stories of

06:52.740 --> 07:02.440
Robert E. Howard. We asked an authority on heroic fantasy, L. Sprague de Camp, to
tell us why the form is so fascinating to readers. I think that part of the

07:02.440 --> 07:21.320
popularity of the genre was a reaction to certain trends in fiction following
the Second World War, such as the fondness for heavily subjective psychological

07:21.320 --> 07:36.720
or psychiatric stories, and stories, very sentimental stories, stories
glorifying the little man, the anti-hero, you know, that hopeless little jerk

07:36.720 --> 07:46.400
who can't do anything right and who has no brains or brawn or character and
whose only function is to suffer and suffer. Well, I think people got sort of

07:46.400 --> 07:59.400
tired of that after a while. So then between the paperback publication of the
Conan stories, for which I can claim the credit, I'm the one who sold them, and

07:59.400 --> 08:14.260
the paperback publication of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, which was the other
major factor in launching this boom, why that got people to reading heroic

08:14.260 --> 08:19.560
fantasy on a large scale, which they are still doing.

08:28.260 --> 08:35.860
De Camp has written his own sword and sorcery, but he's also worked on the Conan
material of Robert E. Howard. He tells us how he was introduced to Howard's

08:35.860 --> 08:49.080
stories of Conan. I went up to New York in, it was around the end of 1950, and,
uh, let me see, I think it was, uh, I think it was a naval war game at Pratt's

08:49.080 --> 08:59.960
apartment or something. No, it wasn't. It was a party at Pratt's apartment. And,
uh, he handed me a copy of Conan the Conqueror, bound in hardback, published by

08:59.960 --> 09:10.040
Gnome Press. And he said, here, take this along, I think you might find it
interesting. I don't care much for it myself, but who knows. So I took it. It

09:10.040 --> 09:20.160
seems that, uh, Martin had, um, by inadvertence, sent, uh, Fletcher two review
copies, and Fletcher gave me one. So I started reading it on the train going

09:20.160 --> 09:30.680
home and was hooked right away. Kept on until I'd read the thing through, and
then I read it through again. Howard died in the 1930s, but de Camp became so

09:30.680 --> 09:39.640
involved with the character of Conan that he started to edit some of Howard's
papers and to write his own Conan stories. And then a year later, I found some,

09:39.800 --> 09:54.980
I learned about some unpublished Conan manuscripts in the custody of, uh, the
agent for the Howard literary estate. And, uh, I read them, and arrangements

09:54.980 --> 10:05.880
were made with the Howard heirs and, uh, the agent for me to edit them for
public, and arrange for publication. And from then on, things have, uh, things

10:05.880 --> 10:09.740
have gone on, uh, on and on, and built up from that.

10:17.680 --> 10:26.560
De Camp has written original Conan material, but he's also finished incomplete
Howard stories and edited others. De Camp is also technical advisor to a movie on

10:26.560 --> 10:35.100
Conan that will premiere this week. It's entitled Conan the Barbarian, and it
will show you what heroic fantasy is all about. More about Robert E. Howard next

10:35.100 --> 10:35.400
time.

10:42.600 --> 10:50.520
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:50.520 --> 10:51.280
Odessa, Texas.

11:34.740 --> 11:37.980
Coming up next is the
Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:53.820 --> 11:59.080
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:01.860 --> 12:03.480
And here are your hosts.

12:08.420 --> 12:16.500
This is David Carson. And David Crews. Robert E. Howard, the creator of Conan the
Barbarian, was a paradox. He was brought up on the arid plains of west-central

12:16.500 --> 12:25.160
Texas, lived in the small country town of Cross Plains, and hardly did any
traveling, and he died by his own hand at the age of 30. Yet Howard wrote heroic

12:25.160 --> 12:32.460
stories that were set in the mythical age after the fall of Atlantis. He was
fascinated with the misty, cold northern landscape in which he set his tales.

12:33.000 --> 12:41.480
Conan, his greatest creation, was a barbarian from the north, a giant who strode
across the Hyborian age wielding a bloody broadsword. But Howard's life was a

12:41.480 --> 12:50.680
quiet one. He was introverted, bookish, and shy. As far as we know, he was never
in a brawl or fight of any kind. Why did Howard create Conan and place him in a

12:50.680 --> 12:59.760
mythical northern landscape? What sort of mind would conceive of a barbarian
hero, a loner who spurns civilization? We spoke with Dr. Charlotte Laughlin, a

12:59.760 --> 13:07.480
professor at Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas, not far from Howard's
home in Cross Plains. Dr. Laughlin is intimate with Howard's life and has done

13:07.480 --> 13:16.120
research for a Howard biography. She believes there are some reasons for
Howard's obsession with Conan. I think that, again, it was a sort of explanation

13:16.120 --> 13:26.180
for why he did not fit in with other people. He liked to believe, I am the last
barbarian. It's because, in my type, we'll prevail. He liked to believe that the

13:26.180 --> 13:34.720
other people had a veneer of civilization on them that got them away from the
basics that were really important. And if you've read his correspondence with

13:34.720 --> 13:46.080
Lovecraft, they had long arguments about the physical versus the intellectual
needs of a society. And Howard would say that in the tough country where he

13:46.080 --> 13:55.920
lived, you had to be physically fit. And he spent a great deal of his life, his
adult life, trying to be physically fit, boxing and working out and that sort of

13:55.920 --> 13:56.120
thing.

14:02.600 --> 14:11.100
Howard also was fascinated with the legendary past of Britain, especially with
the savage Picts and the early heroes of Celtic myth. Some of his Conan stories,

14:11.220 --> 14:20.320
such as Across the Dark River, have ancient Britain as their setting. We asked
Dr. Laughlin why Howard was so drawn to this material. He claimed that he was

14:20.320 --> 14:28.320
full-blood Irish and they were the Irish kings, like some other people we know
claimed to be. But there's no evidence that he certainly was not full-blood

14:28.320 --> 14:37.220
Irish. People have traced his genealogy. But this was part of his image of
himself. He was trying to project other people and trying to create for himself.

14:38.560 --> 14:49.220
There again, he wrote at one time that he wrote about the barren, cold,
windswept, damp areas, even though he lived here. I think that, again, might be

14:49.220 --> 14:57.400
a sort of wish fulfillment. Who wouldn't like to be someplace where it's cold on
a day like this? He wanted to be away from where he was because I don't think we

14:57.400 --> 15:07.200
can underestimate the anger and frustration that was boiling around in Robert
Howard all the time. I see it in all of his poetry and a great deal of his

15:07.200 --> 15:10.560
fiction.

15:11.540 --> 15:19.640
Cross Plains neighbors say that he had a, there was a big tree stump out by his
yard. And I believe it was a sledgehammer, not an axe. And sometimes in the

15:19.640 --> 15:25.720
middle of the day, he would go out there, you know, and you could just see that
he was so tense. And he would take that sledgehammer and he would just wham it

15:25.720 --> 15:35.800
and wham it and wham it on this tree stump. That a tremendous amount of anger,
he didn't fit in with other people. He wanted to be somewhere else. So he wrote

15:35.800 --> 15:38.740
about something that was like nothing he had experienced.

15:45.760 --> 15:54.720
Howard wrote reams of fantasy in the pulp era of the 1930s, most of it for Weird
Tales. We asked Dr. Laughlin why Howard wrote fantasy. Did he have the talent to

15:54.720 --> 16:02.440
write more realistic fiction that might have gotten him out of the pulp ghetto?
He may have had the talent, but I certainly don't believe he was capable of

16:02.440 --> 16:11.220
writing realistic fiction. He was not that closely tied to reality himself. I
don't believe he ever could have written realistic novels. He had to write

16:11.220 --> 16:15.620
fantasies of some sort. More about Robert E. Howard next time.

16:22.640 --> 16:30.480
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:30.480 --> 16:31.240
Odessa, Texas.

17:14.640 --> 17:18.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:34.340 --> 17:39.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.080
And here are your hosts.

17:48.620 --> 17:58.560
This is David Crews. And David Carson. Fantasy writer Robert E. Howard grew up in
the 1920s and the 1930s in the small Texas town of Cross Plains. But he wasn't

17:58.560 --> 18:07.220
like other small town boys. He kept to himself quite a bit. He read a lot and
used a vivid imagination to create his memorable heroic fantasies, foremost of

18:07.220 --> 18:15.720
which are the stories of Conan the Barbarian. Howard died in 1936, but some of
the people in Cross Plains still remember him clearly. We spoke with two of

18:15.720 --> 18:23.620
Howard's friends, Jack Scott, the editor of the Cross Plains newspaper, and
Leroy Butler, Howard's next-door neighbor. Butler remembers a time when he and

18:23.620 --> 18:31.620
Howard were still children, and they bought some swords from a mail-order
company in New York. But we ordered those things, and we'd get out in the

18:31.620 --> 18:44.120
backyard and wrap a bandana hankie around our heads like a pirate, and we'd get
out and fence with those things. Of course, we didn't dare, you know, hit each

18:44.120 --> 18:54.020
other with them, because they'd have gone through you. But we did that quite a
bit. We had an immense live oak tree in our backyard, and we'd get out there and

18:54.020 --> 18:59.380
shade of that old tree and pretend

18:59.380 --> 19:15.600
that we were back maybe in the dark ages or something, or in the time of the
Spanish main, things like that. But he had things like that on his mind all the

19:15.600 --> 19:24.420
time. Butler says that Robert was a loner dedicated to his writing. Robert never
married. He never seemed interested in girls.

19:27.560 --> 19:37.180
And he did have one girlfriend there in Cross Plains for a time. I'd see him out
in the car driving around once in a while. But I don't think that lasted long.

19:37.180 --> 19:54.520
He was just wrapped up in his work, writing those stories. And he had a glassed
-in back porch on the southeast side of the house there. And it wasn't too far

19:54.520 --> 20:05.080
from my mother's bedroom. And a lot of times at night, he'd wake her up with
that typewriter clacking, you know, at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. Some

20:05.080 --> 20:11.260
inspiration, he'd probably be laying there in bed and think of something, and
he'd get up and write it down right quick.

20:14.160 --> 20:27.060
And he just worked all the hours. Jack Scott also comments on Howard's unusual
personality. Howard was a little on the odd side. He wasn't intimate with very

20:27.060 --> 20:38.580
many people. He was rather aloof. But he was a big, robust man. To me, he was a
combination of Edgar Allen Poe and Jack London, if you can imagine that two

20:38.580 --> 20:52.220
together. In 1936, when Howard's mother was dying of a terminal illness, Howard
took his own life. I remember the morning he killed himself very well. I heard

20:52.220 --> 21:01.560
on the street that Robert Howard had just shot himself. But I immediately jumped
in my car and ran down there and got down there. And a few neighbors had

21:01.560 --> 21:13.900
gathered. It wasn't generally known over town, but the old justice of the peace
was standing there on the gallery, the front porch. And when I walked up, he

21:13.900 --> 21:23.920
called me and said, Come here, Jack. And I stepped up there, and he took me into
the bedroom. And he pointed to an old Underwood typewriter that had four lines

21:23.920 --> 21:36.660
written on it there. And Howard had, when he had been told that his mother
wouldn't live throughout the day, he went to this typewriter, wrote these four

21:36.660 --> 21:47.060
lines, and walked outside and sat down in his car and shot his head off. And
this old JP asked me what these four lines meant. They said, I'm sure you've

21:47.060 --> 21:55.960
read them, All fled, all done. So let me on the pyre. The feast is over. The
lamps expire. More about Robert E. Howard next time.

22:02.800 --> 22:10.760
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:10.760 --> 22:11.500
Odessa, Texas.

22:52.720 --> 22:56.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:12.640 --> 23:17.800
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:20.620 --> 23:22.160
And here are your hosts.

23:26.700 --> 23:35.000
This is David Carson. And David Crews. Will Conan the Barbarian ever die, or will
he go on forever? A large portion of the fantasy section of bookstores these

23:35.000 --> 23:43.180
days is filled with books about Conan, the heroic barbarian created by the late
Robert E. Howard. Howard devised a mythical era for his hero and called it the

23:43.180 --> 23:51.760
Hyborian Age. The period falls somewhere between the fall of Atlantis and the
beginnings of recorded history. Conan is a giant barbarian from Cimmeria, a

23:51.760 --> 24:00.060
region to the north of the more civilized Hyborian kingdoms. With his huge
sword, he is an irresistible force that no man can stand up to. Howard wrote

24:00.060 --> 24:08.960
some 21 Conan stories in the 1930s, most published in the pulp magazine Weird
Tales. They trace the life of the barbarian from his teenage years to his later

24:08.960 --> 24:17.420
maturity when he became a king. The tales are full of lusty, bloody adventure,
pure escape fantasy that appeals to man's primal instincts. Conan battles

24:17.420 --> 24:26.260
warriors, sorcerers, and monsters of all shapes. He's a thief, a soldier, a
swashbuckling pirate, and a king. The Conan stories are so popular that a number

24:26.260 --> 24:33.120
of publishing houses have been putting them out. And a number of different
authors have been writing Conan stories. Howard left many gaps in the life of

24:33.120 --> 24:40.500
Conan, and various contemporary writers have been filling those gaps with
original stories. L. Sprague de Camp was the first author to do that. These

24:40.500 --> 24:49.440
stories done by other writers are called pastiches, and established writers such
as de Camp, Andrew J. Offutt, Poul Anderson, Lin Carter, and Bjorn Nyberg have

24:49.440 --> 24:57.660
done them. We went to Robert E. Howard's home territory, the Brownwood Cross
Plains area of west central Texas, to speak with Dr. Charlotte Laughlin and Dr.

24:57.820 --> 25:06.280
William Kreider. Dr. Laughlin has done research for a biography of Howard, and
Dr. Kreider teaches science fiction and fantasy at Howard Payne University. Dr.

25:06.440 --> 25:17.380
Kreider explains what a pastiche is. Well, in the sense that we've been talking
about it, it's where one writer takes a character and a world, like the Hyborian

25:17.380 --> 25:28.380
Age, created by another writer, and writes new stories with the same character
and the same setting. And he gets the full credit for the story, but the other

25:28.380 --> 25:43.340
writer has created the character and the historical setting. Also, de Camp did
something similar, where he took incomplete Howard stories and changed them into

25:43.340 --> 25:52.920
Conan stories, which would be a pastiche of a slightly different kind, but it's
the same principle operating.

26:01.780 --> 26:09.860
The biography of Howard, entitled Dark Valley Destiny, has been written by L.
Sprague de Camp and his wife Catherine, and will probably be out sometime in the

26:09.860 --> 26:17.900
next year. The book will mainly be a psychological study of Howard, which
attempts to explain why he wrote the kind of material he did. Conan has been so

26:17.900 --> 26:25.640
popular that a major movie about him, entitled Conan the Barbarian, is
premiering this week across the country. It was filmed in Spain by director John

26:25.640 --> 26:32.800
Milius and produced by De Laurentiis, and has muscle man Arnold
Schwarzenegger playing Conan. Early reports indicate that it does a marvelous

job of conveying the atmosphere of sword and sorcery essential to a Conan
adventure. Laughlin and Kreider talk about the movie and about Conan's

26:39.920 --> 26:53.520
popularity. If this is a huge success, like Star Wars, let's say, that could
give even more impetus to this kind of thing, and we may see Howard going on

26:53.520 --> 27:04.580
forever with these pastiches being done by... I think it's possible that they
would be continued, because the original idea was to fill out Conan's life, you

27:04.580 --> 27:13.000
know, have his life completely covered by the pastiches from, I don't know if he
went to his boyhood, but certainly all of his adult life when he was an old King

27:13.000 --> 27:20.740
Conan. And it's already gone beyond that. They filled out his life, and then
they're going back to, you know, this stage in his life. He did such and such.

27:21.540 --> 27:30.500
So certainly they're not going to stop with what would be the chronological life
of Conan. So the potential to go on beyond is there. The potential to keep Conan

27:30.500 --> 27:34.960
alive and adventuring is definitely there. We should be hearing a lot more from
Conan.
