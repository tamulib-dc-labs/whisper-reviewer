WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:03.840
Okay, I guess the tape is rolling, so we might as well start.

00:05.900 --> 00:10.960
First of all, I wondered how you became involved in science fiction when you were younger.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.320
Did you read it a lot when you were young?

00:13.320 --> 00:18.400
Yes, I started reading science fiction as opposed to about the earliest form of literature

00:18.400 --> 00:19.140
that I read.

00:19.620 --> 00:26.040
I never made a mental distinction between science fiction and fantasy.

00:27.540 --> 00:34.760
Anything is that nature because my parents brought it to me to read, and I just simply

00:34.760 --> 00:39.400
regarded it as the most interesting reading material that I had accessible.

00:41.160 --> 00:46.540
So naturally, when I began turning to writing, that's what I wrote.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.620
Why did you start writing science fiction?

00:54.300 --> 00:57.240
Well, actually, they took my television program off the air.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.420
Our television, at that time, I was 10.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.740
Television hadn't been around in private homes very long.

01:06.600 --> 01:11.960
I had just time enough to get clearly addicted to television science fiction, and then it

01:11.960 --> 01:14.400
ran at this course, and it was gone from the air.

01:14.640 --> 01:20.860
So I, you know, a set of mourning and went into the bedroom, picked up a tablet and

01:20.860 --> 01:22.580
then started writing my own novels.

01:25.680 --> 01:30.440
Your first published novel, I think, was the year 1976, the date of April?

01:30.840 --> 01:31.580
Yes, yes.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.500
Have you published any stories before then?

01:35.220 --> 01:41.380
No, not for one of trying, but I've never regarded myself as a short story writer.

01:41.760 --> 01:50.800
I don't tend to think in that convenient length, and consequently, I wrote novels.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.140
And novels, and novels.

01:53.760 --> 02:02.060
And it was, actually, turned in brothers very first, and since they seem to be some question

02:02.060 --> 02:11.260
about it being a little long, as many of my works didn't be, I very, very quickly wrote

02:11.260 --> 02:19.140
the date of April while teaching school, et cetera, and managed to get it finished inside

02:19.140 --> 02:19.780
two months.

02:23.540 --> 02:30.680
One thing I wondered is, you said that you didn't distinguish between science fiction and

02:30.680 --> 02:31.740
the other reading that you did.

02:32.480 --> 02:36.880
But I wonder why you didn't do some other kind of writing instead of science fiction.

02:36.880 --> 02:40.560
I think you could have been a writer in almost any area that you tried.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.380
I don't write the other things because I didn't like them.

02:45.300 --> 02:53.160
In general, I find that I suppose the only thing outside of science fiction that I've

02:53.160 --> 02:55.220
ever tried in my hand at writing has been mystery.

02:57.020 --> 03:04.780
And I do care for the modern science, though, and I've always viewed them as a great deal

03:04.780 --> 03:10.500
and more fun to read than they are to write, mostly because you have to be extremely

03:10.500 --> 03:11.180
controlled.

03:12.580 --> 03:16.720
And I suspect that mystery writers have to know who did it.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.240
And I'd rather not know the end of my books.

03:22.920 --> 03:27.080
The other thing that I've tried in my hand at is historical fiction.

03:28.060 --> 03:32.020
And I find, again, that's a straight-jacket because you're rather well-held with what

03:32.020 --> 03:34.580
all happened, whether or not it makes artistic sense.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.220
So just for the sheer pleasure of writing, I'd prefer science fiction.

03:42.580 --> 03:43.060
Okay.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.520
Was it the only real one that published that first book?

03:47.040 --> 03:47.460
Yes, it was.

03:49.580 --> 03:52.760
Have you established any contact or made any attempts?

03:52.880 --> 03:55.020
Or was that the first one that you'd sent out?

03:55.580 --> 03:55.780
No.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.340
You mean with other publishing sources and what have you?

04:00.340 --> 04:03.160
Yeah, I would send it with that.

04:03.160 --> 04:13.200
Well, actually, my group's been estimated with Rohan as an editor because I had gone through

04:13.200 --> 04:17.300
my library finally after seven years of trying to sell things and I thought, well, there

04:17.820 --> 04:19.300
must be a system to this.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.700
You see, I had no professional help at all.

04:22.820 --> 04:29.400
And I began searching my library to see what editor had published the majority of works

04:29.400 --> 04:33.680
and writers that I liked, figuring that we might have something in common as far as taste

04:33.680 --> 04:34.020
goes.

04:35.340 --> 04:46.340
So I began researching Don Rohan to see what his preferences were, where we differed and

04:46.340 --> 04:47.200
where we were similar.

04:47.740 --> 04:53.980
And so I began to conclude more and more that we were fairly well-centedical when it came

04:53.980 --> 04:59.760
to taste, not quite the same all the way down the line, but generally there's a broad

04:59.760 --> 05:00.660
area of overlap.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.400
So I found it very easy to work with.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.240
Okay, I just had one more question on your back end and so forth.

05:12.760 --> 05:20.300
Do you identify or do you think there are any influences, either writers or anything in

05:20.300 --> 05:23.800
your back, or I guess in terms of science fiction writers, that did any influence on you

05:23.800 --> 05:24.500
and the way you write?

05:25.880 --> 05:31.740
Well, it's very difficult to put a pin it down because I am one of the most Catholic science

05:31.740 --> 05:35.920
fiction writers, readers who are likely to find, I read everything I can get my hands

05:35.920 --> 05:37.880
on and noise and have on the speed reader.

05:40.040 --> 05:46.820
But classically speaking, I suppose that our poopliest or jilliest model is one of the

05:46.820 --> 05:52.580
outstanding influences on my writing simply because he's one writer that I spent an enormous

05:52.580 --> 05:59.160
amount of time with, at least historically speaking, and when I was doing my studies.

06:00.600 --> 06:16.800
In terms of science fiction writers that have had a great yellow influence on me, I can

06:16.800 --> 06:22.660
have a hairy bait, a power, rubber tower.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.600
It was very difficult in the town that I grew up in to find any science fiction.

06:27.820 --> 06:33.220
Jack Williams was one and Edgar Rice Burroughs and so on.

06:35.160 --> 06:41.840
But the time that you see I kept getting run out of the store, they would locate a juvenile

06:41.840 --> 06:47.180
back there in the science fiction section and immediately they would begin to suggest

06:47.180 --> 06:52.740
that possibly I should be looking at the Dick and Jane novels somewhere else.

06:53.940 --> 07:00.260
And so I did have a little difficulty both in library and in bookstores trying to get

07:00.260 --> 07:02.740
out of science fiction books undetected.

07:07.420 --> 07:11.480
Okay, I think you said you'd sit out or written brothers of earth before Gated

07:11.480 --> 07:17.380
of Abrail, but I still wanted to ask why you so early got into writing the, I guess I

07:17.380 --> 07:20.180
would call it a heroic fantasy, I'm not sure that's how you'd identify with Gated

07:20.180 --> 07:23.940
of Abrail, but how did you sort of begin with that kind of a?

07:23.940 --> 07:26.060
Well, I didn't.

07:27.140 --> 07:29.480
They weren't the first books that I had written.

07:30.860 --> 07:39.160
There are others which are tentative efforts that didn't tan out in one way or another,

07:39.400 --> 07:39.840
everybody.

07:40.460 --> 07:45.500
I won't say everybody, but a majority of writers tend to have them.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.360
My first love is really technology.

07:49.020 --> 07:58.720
The only thing is that I had been out of the technological mainstream while they had made

07:58.720 --> 08:01.720
numerous scientific advances that I was not current with.

08:02.420 --> 08:09.300
And it annoys me a great deal to the old that I'm writing something that is not technically

08:09.300 --> 08:09.820
accurate.

08:09.820 --> 08:13.880
So, or that I have glossed over something.

08:16.060 --> 08:22.280
It irritates me personally to postulate well, for instance, we have a gravity field here

08:22.280 --> 08:23.880
which keeps everyone's feet on the deck.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.960
I want to know how it works.

08:27.980 --> 08:34.400
So consequently I wrote heroic fantasy while I was doing a great deal of reading in scientific

08:34.400 --> 08:35.020
American.

08:36.640 --> 08:42.660
Also heroic fantasy is an area where I have a good deal of expertise since I have a major

08:43.400 --> 08:49.200
in classic history, archaeology, anthropology, this sort of thing.

08:49.900 --> 08:56.080
But I'd always been a sort of a hobbyist and a little more than a hobbyist since it was

08:56.080 --> 08:58.080
one of my fields in the history of technology.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.200
Okay, I'm not sure I'm going to pronounce some of these names right.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.380
So after I hear you pronounce them, we'll get them right when we do the show.

09:09.680 --> 09:13.140
I guess it's more gain.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.260
I still have a little puzzlement about her.

09:17.420 --> 09:23.400
Was she a creature or a force existing before the call or the call?

09:23.660 --> 09:24.620
I'm not sure how that's pronounced.

09:24.620 --> 09:31.220
They're called, well actually, now there's some of this I'm not about to give away as

09:31.220 --> 09:37.060
regards to the history of more gain because that gets into the possibility of a book that

09:37.060 --> 09:38.200
I'm working on at the moment.

09:38.960 --> 09:45.620
The first set of books, the gate books, involves much more the character of Vanya, who is a

09:45.620 --> 09:46.440
medieval man.

09:47.660 --> 09:53.720
I have to take his viewpoint or they cease to be heroic fantasy and they begin to be

09:53.720 --> 09:58.400
a science fiction novel, pure and simple because more gain is far more technologically

09:58.400 --> 10:03.660
sophisticated than he is and if it were told from her viewpoint it would begin to be

10:03.660 --> 10:05.200
a thing of numbers and calculus.

10:07.980 --> 10:13.280
More gain is far more advanced, exactly where she comes from and what she is I've preferred

10:13.280 --> 10:22.060
to leave to the readers' estimation or I will say that your surmises are fairly well

10:22.060 --> 10:22.680
down the center.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.180
Okay, that's why I wasn't sure.

10:26.340 --> 10:27.260
I thought maybe I missed something.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.520
I thought you were being a little ambiguous.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.160
It is deliberately vague.

10:31.580 --> 10:38.400
Firstly because the character of more gain has evolved as I've done it also partially

10:38.400 --> 10:45.420
because I have wished to keep those books as heroic fantasy or the reason that the

10:45.420 --> 10:50.420
technology of the gate is so vague that again I prefer to know how things work and since

10:50.420 --> 10:55.060
that one is far more fantastical than some of the other technology I work with I prefer

10:55.060 --> 10:56.580
to keep it in the realm of fantasy.

10:58.740 --> 11:02.140
Okay, you also just said that you might be working or you are working on some more books

11:02.140 --> 11:03.200
that might involve that material.

11:03.200 --> 11:07.500
I was going to ask, did you, when you started the first book, did you have the idea of

11:07.500 --> 11:07.920
a trilogy?

11:09.180 --> 11:17.620
No, actually the first book quit where it quit except that they had been entered into the

11:17.620 --> 11:21.620
books and print of theories which rather surprised me.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.360
And so I thought, well, why not?

11:26.240 --> 11:31.940
For a little while I have found it relaxing and to a certain extent still do.

11:32.760 --> 11:41.200
To alternate both my reading and my writing of hard tech with fantasy because I do produce

11:41.200 --> 11:48.180
at an enormous rate compared to some other writers who may labor one or two years on a book.

11:49.840 --> 11:54.560
Well a good deal of anyone working on a book for one or two years is not writing time,

11:54.560 --> 11:55.520
it's thinking time.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.660
And because physically to write it down takes a precious little while, you can write any

12:01.660 --> 12:03.460
given book down in less than a month.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.700
You can just think of that.

12:05.760 --> 12:13.060
So I have found that to give my imagination a rest as it were, it does really help to shift

12:13.060 --> 12:14.140
gears between books.

12:14.760 --> 12:20.000
That's why I tend to do things which are radically different from the other.

12:20.180 --> 12:24.960
I may worry over a similar theme, I may do it once in science fiction and once in fantasy,

12:25.780 --> 12:34.680
thus providing endless amusement or fodder for reviewers who are trying to find some sort

12:34.680 --> 12:35.700
of a common theme.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.300
Well basically it's just that I've just finished working with that and the storytelling

12:39.300 --> 12:40.360
around in my head.

12:40.560 --> 12:46.560
So I did it in a different medium just as an artist may tend to paint a lot in blue because

12:46.560 --> 12:48.960
that's the color they had last on their palette.

12:49.620 --> 12:55.260
I don't think there's any particularly deep significance to some of these similarities

12:55.260 --> 13:01.980
just that some of the works were done in sort of opposition to each other, different

13:01.980 --> 13:03.200
types, different styles.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.960
Was there any reader response that made you continue with that series?

13:10.500 --> 13:12.500
Well there has been a great deal of reader response.

13:13.540 --> 13:19.180
I think that there is a list.

13:20.180 --> 13:22.000
I had a great deal of fun writing it.

13:23.900 --> 13:27.280
I looked back on it and decided I had a great deal of fun writing it.

13:27.460 --> 13:32.520
Sometimes the character of Morgane Eurotated me so much that I was just about ready to

13:32.520 --> 13:36.040
give up throwing the towel while I was creating it.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.120
I think I tend to sympathize much more with Vanya.

13:42.160 --> 13:48.360
But yes there has been a very strong reader response to it and I've always had a really

13:48.360 --> 13:53.220
great affection for this trilogy myself.

13:53.820 --> 14:00.280
It's one of the few works that I have really felt that I could go back to and possibly

14:00.280 --> 14:01.520
do another three books.

14:05.020 --> 14:11.540
Usually when you've written three books on anything you tend to be burned out on it.

14:12.340 --> 14:17.480
Because while a reader may devour it in a single night or series of nights and it's

14:17.480 --> 14:25.960
gone for the writer, you had to live with it constantly for better part of the year on

14:25.960 --> 14:26.620
each segment.

14:28.820 --> 14:36.500
So for some curious reason, Morgane books are one of the only ones that I really find

14:36.500 --> 14:37.780
easy to return to.

14:40.240 --> 14:47.120
You mentioned that Vanya was a medieval man and of course Eurotated me so I look back

14:47.120 --> 14:48.220
to the medieval formulas.

14:49.360 --> 14:55.940
But it seems to me that you have in some ways reversed the normal formula and making the

14:56.560 --> 15:02.240
I guess the heroic part of the book, the woman and I don't know what you'd want to call

15:02.240 --> 15:06.700
her, not sidekick but her helper, I guess the male.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.780
I think some readers respond that they were not surprised at that but it was a little

15:11.780 --> 15:13.560
unusual to have the male in that position.

15:13.560 --> 15:21.300
Well, I think that there is some literary tradition for it.

15:21.920 --> 15:26.120
The notion of courtly love is one possibility.

15:29.240 --> 15:42.540
There is also the fact that in terms of the age of which those characters were created

15:44.720 --> 15:54.760
I had really conceived both characters when I was about probably 14 and again I think

15:54.760 --> 15:59.080
a reason why it's much easier for me to return to those because they almost come out

15:59.080 --> 16:04.980
of my extreme youth and there's one always has an affection for things of that sort.

16:05.180 --> 16:06.900
They are sort of archetypal with us.

16:06.900 --> 16:12.920
But in one form or another they are very early creations of mine.

16:13.780 --> 16:21.560
And as such, that was the time at which I was really just beginning to toy with being

16:21.560 --> 16:23.300
able to do male characters at all.

16:24.220 --> 16:33.680
Of course, there was the version that is in print was done completely separate from any

16:33.680 --> 16:34.580
of the early works.

16:34.580 --> 16:38.100
I didn't look at it for refer to the earlier works.

16:39.100 --> 16:45.120
When I did this, when I did Kate of Israel, I just sort of remembered it a long time ago.

16:45.300 --> 16:50.460
But I suppose that's the reason that the characters flowed away they did.

16:51.240 --> 17:02.220
There's also the fact that I think that artistically to me made a fairly interesting story in terms

17:02.220 --> 17:08.480
of the relationship between the two characters, the fact that Ghania's best setting scene,

17:08.480 --> 17:12.060
as you will, is arrogance, pride and temper.

17:13.400 --> 17:20.940
And if you can conceive of any situation for a medieval man in which arrogance, pride and

17:20.940 --> 17:24.180
temper are going to get a little afraid, it's the sort of situation.

17:27.820 --> 17:31.000
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and move on to a whole new topic.

17:32.380 --> 17:36.440
I think one of the things that impressed me the most, and I'm sure it impresses most

17:36.440 --> 17:40.060
of your readers rightly, is your construction of alien cultures.

17:42.120 --> 17:48.680
And I was curious as to whether you use models or anilons for them or do you create them

17:48.680 --> 17:49.400
out of thin air.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.640
Yes, and no, and both.

17:54.480 --> 17:58.480
One of my areas of study is for mentioned is anthropology.

17:59.900 --> 18:10.040
I have also done a great deal of study in ecology, biology, genetics, although strictly

18:10.040 --> 18:13.040
as an amateur, and that feels because it is a very complex one.

18:17.000 --> 18:29.060
And in a way, I do take some items from the knowledge that I have, earthly animals, cultures,

18:29.720 --> 18:32.940
communities, ecosystems, and so on.

18:34.360 --> 18:41.780
But most of my knowledge of human culture is, again, rather strange.

18:41.780 --> 18:52.620
And I know the prehistoric or bronze age that holds span up to the iron age, much better

18:52.620 --> 18:55.020
than I do say later periods.

18:56.240 --> 19:04.780
So a great deal of what I know about human history is so basic or lies so far back down

19:04.780 --> 19:14.120
in the time track that a divergence from what happened at any given point is going to

19:14.120 --> 19:22.080
produce massive alterations in an urban culture much further along the line.

19:23.020 --> 19:28.220
Consequently, for instance, when I did the Faded Sun novels, which are basically a desert

19:28.220 --> 19:34.700
culture, I did not pattern it off any modern desert culture about which I know Frank

19:34.700 --> 19:34.860
Lee.

19:35.060 --> 19:35.300
Nothing.

19:36.260 --> 19:42.300
I patterned it strictly by taking what I know about desert survival.

19:43.800 --> 19:56.320
And earlier, nomadic cultures, your honor, can thrive a biology that would work under

19:56.320 --> 19:59.160
the extreme conditions that I postulated.

19:59.160 --> 20:03.140
And then grew elements from here and there.

20:04.180 --> 20:09.680
It's very strange that I now get letters from people that say that it very closely resembles

20:09.680 --> 20:13.360
a modern, to-restrialed, nomadic culture.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.900
But this is strictly a surprise to me.

20:17.100 --> 20:22.600
I suppose it just says that I knew something about the variation once.

20:25.400 --> 20:25.880
Okay.

20:29.020 --> 20:36.460
Why does then, I guess in many of your books, I would even say the majority, you somehow

20:36.460 --> 20:41.520
in the book have a theme or motif of alien human closeness.

20:43.160 --> 20:48.040
You know, sometimes your humans have actually become part of an alien civilization if they

20:48.040 --> 20:49.660
don't at least they become very close to it.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.720
That is that fascinating to you so much.

20:54.200 --> 21:00.620
Well, partly I suppose it's what I said earlier that one can't to toss one idea around until

21:00.620 --> 21:02.820
you've got that color completely off your palate.

21:04.920 --> 21:09.420
I don't know how long it will continue to fascinate me, I suppose there's a limit to

21:09.420 --> 21:12.760
how much one can say about any given thing.

21:13.900 --> 21:18.860
And not all of my novels involve aliens among those novels.

21:19.080 --> 21:25.380
I can't some that are not yet published but are only partially complete if I say that

21:25.380 --> 21:29.320
I have about 13 works in progress at the moment you may understand.

21:32.240 --> 21:36.840
But so what is on the stands is sort of the tip of the iceberg, at least as far as my

21:36.840 --> 21:37.540
body work.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.200
But indeed I do a great deal of it.

21:41.600 --> 21:48.000
I think part of the fascination for it lies in the fact that I myself have been a lifelong

21:48.000 --> 21:54.280
student of cultures and if there's anything that I can conceive of that is slightly stranger

21:54.280 --> 21:59.720
than being lost in Greece and unable to speak the local dialect, it's being lost somewhere

21:59.720 --> 22:04.820
else and an even worse shape and managed managing to survive it.

22:05.580 --> 22:10.160
It pleases me also because it is a type of conflict that one can develop that does not

22:10.160 --> 22:15.840
involve necessarily everyone taking sides lining up and starting to shoot at each other.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.640
Although this sometimes does happen.

22:20.760 --> 22:25.220
It is a way to get sort of like the man against nature stories, you can have a very exciting

22:25.220 --> 22:28.820
story about a man who is simply trying to survive in a hostile environment.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.820
Some environments don't involve icebergs, they involve cities.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.880
They involve cultures that you've never met before.

22:38.020 --> 22:44.160
And I do hope just as a matter of practical philosophy that one thing this age of ours

22:44.160 --> 22:52.560
is begun to produce is an understanding in the human race that we can not only get along

22:52.560 --> 22:56.180
with each other, we can get along with other creatures on the same planet.

22:56.560 --> 23:01.680
Perhaps it is the final lesson that any species learns before they are fit to set foot in

23:01.680 --> 23:02.020
the space.

23:02.720 --> 23:08.540
At least I hope this is the case which may guarantee the peaceful intention of potential

23:08.540 --> 23:08.940
neighbors.

23:10.820 --> 23:16.180
I think you have so much to answer my next question which is going to be if you deliberately

23:17.580 --> 23:19.480
counterpointed alien in human cultures.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.900
You just suggested there would be a value to that.

23:25.260 --> 23:27.840
We should learn to live with other species and so forth.

23:28.580 --> 23:32.760
That would be a fair statement that you do counterpoint, liberty.

23:34.160 --> 23:38.860
One of the most difficult things on the face of the earth for instance is for two people

23:39.340 --> 23:43.900
who do not speak each other's language well to communicate.

23:44.820 --> 23:51.680
It is also certainly true as diplomats have discovered for centuries that you can speak

23:51.680 --> 23:56.600
someone else's language perfectly and still have trouble getting your point across.

23:57.270 --> 24:05.420
Simply because language extends into time, history and accumulated meanings as well as

24:05.420 --> 24:12.860
it does just the present meanings which are contained in the dictionary, context and history

24:12.860 --> 24:20.200
have a great bearing on language so that when you begin to talk about the difficulties

24:20.200 --> 24:27.240
of communicating species to species where you may even have a totally different psychology

24:27.240 --> 24:30.120
that your problems are much more severe.

24:31.020 --> 24:35.440
It is also an area of ongoing research in the scientific community.

24:35.960 --> 24:41.060
It is the studies that are done with primates, the studies that are done with dolphins and

24:41.060 --> 24:41.580
with whales.

24:43.660 --> 24:50.840
Mankind as a whole outside of the science fiction field is finally beginning to wake up to the fact

24:50.840 --> 24:56.640
that you do not necessarily have to think like a human being to be, quote,,

24:56.880 --> 24:57.320
intelligent.

24:58.020 --> 25:05.260
That intelligence is a function of many different things and anyone who has ever talked in school

25:06.620 --> 25:13.740
will rapidly come to the conclusion that intelligence is not a quantity that can be neatly assessed.

25:14.320 --> 25:21.960
It has to do with the spatial perceptions and relationships with the ability to compare

25:21.960 --> 25:22.840
and grant a lot.

25:23.020 --> 25:26.200
Human intelligence has made up of many many different factors.

25:26.860 --> 25:34.200
One may be particularly gifted in one or more of them, not so gifted in others and it makes for a great

25:34.200 --> 25:35.200
range of abilities.

25:35.880 --> 25:40.260
Even more so when you are dealing with different species who may have completely different

25:40.260 --> 25:50.360
environments, whose visual range may be different to the, some may see, for instance, into the

25:50.360 --> 25:55.380
infrared, some may hear sounds which are not audible.

25:56.200 --> 26:01.680
So on and so forth, just biologically speaking, so you may have a psychology and a history

26:01.680 --> 26:08.580
that are very different from anything that we are anticipating simply because of a biological

26:08.580 --> 26:09.140
barrier.

26:12.260 --> 26:12.620
Okay.

26:12.940 --> 26:15.140
I guess I'll just move on to a question.

26:15.340 --> 26:16.520
Questions on a few of your works.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.300
Obviously I'm not going to be able to hit all of your works.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.100
We don't have time to do that, but there were a few of them all wanted to sing along.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.400
I think it's pronounced the pride of Chinner.

26:26.060 --> 26:26.420
Chinner.

26:26.660 --> 26:28.080
Yes, the pride of Chinner.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.400
Okay.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.400
Let me just give you, ask you this question.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.220
First of all, is it the honey?

26:37.020 --> 26:37.700
Honey, really.

26:39.440 --> 26:46.400
I somehow receive the impression their society, their physical makeup was in some ways based on

26:46.400 --> 26:46.760
lions.

26:47.120 --> 26:47.800
Yes, absolutely.

26:49.060 --> 26:55.140
This is one case where I've taken the species of lions.

26:55.860 --> 27:04.140
And in a very simple way, devised a culture of an advanced species which, which very closely

27:04.140 --> 27:13.060
parallels the biology and if you will, social patterns of a lion pride, the title of the

27:13.060 --> 27:14.600
books, of course, is three-way pun.

27:17.540 --> 27:23.920
Meaning the pride of lions, the pride of the race and the name of the ship?

27:24.500 --> 27:24.940
Yes.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.640
How the creature involved together?

27:29.040 --> 27:33.100
And also that would be why the females are the ones who go space-faring in the male stay

27:33.100 --> 27:33.400
at home.

27:33.680 --> 27:33.860
Yes.

27:35.300 --> 27:38.660
Among the lions you will notice that the females do the hunting.

27:40.420 --> 27:41.500
Okay, I'm proud of myself.

27:41.720 --> 27:42.240
Think of that out.

27:43.540 --> 27:45.840
But Ty, they're the human in that book.

27:48.060 --> 27:50.020
And of course he is totally alone.

27:50.260 --> 27:51.480
He's very pitiful creature.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.100
You know, the only one of his kind, I guess, until the end of his book.

27:56.100 --> 27:56.740
Very unheroic.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.800
And you know, it's a lot of stuff I realize.

28:01.960 --> 28:05.320
I'm reading the book from an alien point of view and here's a human being and I'm feeling

28:05.320 --> 28:06.700
sorry for him, which is unusual.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.000
I guess that was just for the line of the story.

28:12.220 --> 28:15.960
Do you do that on purpose to give us a different, maybe perspective on humanity?

28:16.620 --> 28:18.960
I've never seen a bad-boone react to it.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.400
No, it's raw terror.

28:24.280 --> 28:29.460
It primates nervous system is not really set up to be setting in the center of a pride of

28:29.460 --> 28:29.780
lions.

28:31.080 --> 28:36.000
It's really one of the most unkind things I believe that you could do to a human being

28:36.000 --> 28:41.860
as far as social patterns would be to drop them right into the middle of a feline culture.

28:44.380 --> 28:46.620
Because the moves are all wrong.

28:48.200 --> 28:53.720
Well, for instance, Polly being a primate smiles.

28:55.260 --> 28:57.720
And of course this is exactly the wrong thing to do.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.580
You know what a lion does when it smiles.

28:59.860 --> 29:00.980
It's not a friendly gesture.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.820
Every gesture he makes is wrong.

29:05.820 --> 29:11.580
Every gesture they make is wrong at least as far as he's concerned.

29:11.580 --> 29:18.180
He is, however, a very heroic human being if you just simply analyze what he has done.

29:19.460 --> 29:23.940
He has managed to survive a very horrendous situation.

29:24.520 --> 29:30.220
He has managed to collect himself with some dignity out of a situation which would have broken

29:30.220 --> 29:36.960
drastically in a average individual would have definitely come out of it damaged.

29:38.360 --> 29:46.440
He's been forced to take horrendous decisions and he's been dumped into a situation where even his

29:46.440 --> 29:49.160
personal value is of some question.

29:50.380 --> 30:00.320
And yet he manages to stand up on a sign beaten and confront the honey captain with a here I am

30:00.320 --> 30:05.960
come and see if you can do something about it kind of attitude which is of course what wins the captain's respect.

30:06.900 --> 30:16.300
In the beginning he calms down a little bit as you will see when he begins trying to deal with him doing what any

30:16.300 --> 30:24.860
sensible person would do when confronted with a situation where you suspect that the beings around you are at least

30:24.860 --> 30:32.500
sensually friendly and there's no need provoking something that would be a total misunderstanding.

30:33.160 --> 30:45.480
So he does remain a little bit quiet but he's quiet partially because he's smart and is trying to absorb more data than he gets out.

30:47.800 --> 30:55.220
Okay I see that now and I suppose yeah in terms of what where he was I guess he was sort of courageous individual.

30:55.940 --> 30:58.460
Let me move on for just a second to damn the station.

31:00.800 --> 31:06.580
The plotting in a setting of that novel is impressed me a great deal.

31:07.460 --> 31:18.040
Did you use a strict extrapolation to advise the society and the company and the merchants and the way you set that book up?

31:19.220 --> 31:33.460
Yes I follow the NASA reports. I'm a great supporter of the spacecraft and I do follow it very very closely.

31:34.440 --> 31:45.370
And one of the things that is always interested me is the economic mechanisms the reason for going into space, the reason for colonization.

31:46.410 --> 32:04.290
I also recall being cops and rather inaccurate things when I was back in chemistry roll about the altruistic motives for colonizations to hear some of the old tales I heard.

32:04.450 --> 32:14.110
The Greek call went out and colonized the Mediterranean just because it was there or just because they felt it would be a noble thing to do.

32:14.110 --> 32:17.710
Which is very far from the truth it was economic necessity.

32:19.810 --> 32:24.570
Many of them were getting out of Greece because the pressures at home were incredible.

32:26.190 --> 32:43.550
In this particular instance I simply took the situation we presently have and as a background or the novel I simply extrapolated our present situation over the couple of hundred years.

32:45.490 --> 33:00.610
This is pretty well what I see going on based on modern economic necessity and a little bit of altruism and the sense that science and science with the sake of science will continue.

33:01.150 --> 33:11.710
If you like we've already launched the first star probe. Our problem is that right now we haven't got the budget or the research to enable them to do a loop and come back to us.

33:12.290 --> 33:18.730
But I imagine that really in the next century there will be such proplotions.

33:20.450 --> 33:24.170
Was that a bit more difficult to plot and harder to write than you others?

33:24.570 --> 33:34.790
It was a bear. It really was. I think because it was sort of a collection of all the things that I had been trying to do up to that point.

33:35.030 --> 33:40.350
All the research, all the reading that I had been doing and trying to rationalize this universe of mine.

33:41.710 --> 33:57.610
To give it some sort of a scientific accuracy. The one thing you have to grant me is faster than light travel. Everything else I designed is at least within near reach of archaic abilities.

33:57.610 --> 34:11.090
The plot is necessarily complex because we're dealing here with the future of the human race.

34:12.610 --> 34:18.530
The human race is actually the character in this novel in one odd sense.

34:19.230 --> 34:32.430
There are a number of specimens that are not too nice. Fortunately there are some who are at least in my own estimation, good people.

34:33.830 --> 34:41.190
And the novel follows the activities of a great many of them at a very hazardous moment for humanity.

34:41.190 --> 34:49.410
That at which part of humanity is literally breaking free of earth, never to come back again.

34:50.330 --> 35:03.830
And in which another portion of humanity is trying to retain their heritage and to try to reach an accommodation between what they were and what they are.

35:03.830 --> 35:14.610
And manage to deal with the new realities that are meeting at the same time.

35:16.710 --> 35:21.870
Okay, this probably isn't a fair question to ask an author. I've had a number of them say, make up your own mind.

35:24.610 --> 35:33.030
But in terms of who you side with, if you side with anybody, I was probably more identified more with Sydney Mallory than anybody in the book.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.730
Would that be anywhere near what you intended?

35:36.930 --> 35:44.890
To a certain extent, yes. Sydney Mallory is a very inagmatic individual in some ways.

35:46.090 --> 35:51.090
She's difficult to, even for a creator to get a handle on.

35:52.330 --> 36:04.670
There are a number of things going on with her. To a certain extent, it disturbs me that she is as she really cares as she is.

36:04.950 --> 36:11.770
Because when you analyze what she does, you really have to line her up on the side of the not nice people.

36:14.890 --> 36:32.630
On the other hand, if you got into an argument with her on morality, she would point to the morality that created the ghastly situation on the station and asked who got the better results.

36:34.250 --> 36:43.750
So Mallory is forever dealing in very, very uncomfortable paradoxes. Often even the author does not like what Mallory does.

36:44.630 --> 36:49.970
But sometimes it is the most direct solution that saves the greatest number of lives.

36:51.490 --> 36:56.570
She is, as I say, sort of an uncomfortable figure.

36:57.570 --> 37:14.610
As that history of that rural develops in subsequent books, I think it will become clear that Mallory's influence persists among those people and it is not always a whole for one.

37:15.570 --> 37:29.050
Mallory can be a very palatable, very appealing individual. The problem is that some people persist in following her policies and come to less happy results.

37:30.630 --> 37:52.790
So it is a kind of a novel that lays the foundation for a good many things. And for instance, the security organization in the faded sun, the weather sinister degus, I believe, is named is, is several centuries down the road Mallory's creation.

37:56.350 --> 38:01.710
Okay, that is interesting. I was just going to move on to that. Let me give you one more question on down below station.

38:01.730 --> 38:08.610
In fact, it applies to faded sun too in a couple of your other books. You have already mentioned the fact that we have to give you the faster the night travel.

38:11.170 --> 38:20.830
Still, considering the so-called jump and the same space battles in down below station, I don't think I read any more convincing space battles than those.

38:24.490 --> 38:32.450
The faster the night travel, the jump and so forth, you didn't make any attempt to that and I guess you can't back it up or prove anything there.

38:33.230 --> 38:37.430
There was a much science behind that or a myth that I don't know how you did it, where it was convincing.

38:39.210 --> 38:44.330
Well, I worked very hard at it. I always loved Dr. Smith.

38:46.930 --> 38:58.490
And one of the things that I always felt that I would like to bring back to the field of science fiction, if I could, was the space yarn.

38:59.450 --> 39:14.310
I mean, for a long time now, science fiction, we've been on planets, we've built cities, we've gotten so earthbound that a lot of the romance and space flight itself has gone down.

39:14.310 --> 39:33.970
I'm unexpressed in literature. And I wish to be able to develop a mechanism which would enable me to write oddly enough, after working my brain cell on it, the simple kind of story that I used to enjoy when I was young.

39:35.090 --> 39:44.890
And I suddenly realized that I was in my neck in a relativistic kind of all sorts of things.

39:45.430 --> 40:00.590
One of the things that fascinated me when I began to work out the battles, and even there I took some shortcuts as anyone who wants to cut in an argument, I will freely admit that there were some things I had to do for artistic value.

40:02.490 --> 40:16.550
But one of the things that I began to discover was that in terms of being on one of those ships in the battle, that suddenly in a very practical way, I was up against the Einsteinian stoppage of time.

40:18.010 --> 40:26.430
Because when you are traveling near sea, near the speed of light, a board one of those ships all time has stopped.

40:26.850 --> 40:33.490
You exist at one moment, traveling forever. If you send a message, it can go no faster than you do.

40:34.190 --> 40:46.530
And that message will arrive at the same time. So essentially you exist in a frozen segment of time, an event horizon which is perpetuating itself across the system in which you're operating.

40:47.550 --> 40:57.590
And I began to find that a rather mind-bending concept, particularly when I was trying to plot out the strategy.

40:58.550 --> 41:05.910
If your enemy exists as an event horizon and you exist as another one, how thickens you are going to figure out where he is.

41:08.810 --> 41:11.610
Okay, listen, David has to flip the tape about.
