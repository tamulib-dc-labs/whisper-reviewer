00:08.600 --> 00:12.540
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.260 --> 00:33.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.980
And here are your hosts.

00:41.820 --> 00:48.620
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Chad Oliver has never really been able to
devote himself fully to writing science fiction, though he's been publishing it

00:48.620 --> 00:55.740
for over 30 years. He's also a teacher, a professor of anthropology at the
University of Texas at Austin. As is true with many science fiction authors,

00:55.940 --> 01:02.560
Oliver's start as a writer resulted from his fascination with reading science
fiction. As a teenager, he discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs in his lush Martian

01:02.560 --> 01:11.380
stories and tried to get his hands on everything Burroughs published. Because of
the addiction to Burroughs, one time when I was in a newsstand, I saw a copy of

01:11.380 --> 01:26.220
the big old fat Amazing Stories. It had a cover story by Burroughs called Tiger
Girl, and also a story by Eando Binder. You remember him? Or rather, you

01:26.220 --> 01:35.480
remember them, Earl and Otto, called Adam Link Saves the World. Anyway, I bought
the copy of Amazing because I wanted to read the Burroughs story, and I figured,

01:35.560 --> 01:46.280
well, I might as well read all this other stuff, too. And there was a story in
there by Edmond Hamilton called Treasure on Thunder Moon, which I read and was

01:46.280 --> 01:54.380
immediately hooked. I thought this was, you know, the greatest thing I had ever
read, maybe the greatest thing anybody had ever written. And I decided, well, by

01:54.380 --> 02:05.920
golly, the thing to be is to be a professional writer and to write science
fiction. And I got a second-hand portable typewriter, and I taught myself to

02:05.920 --> 02:20.720
type, and I wrote something every week between the time I was 14 and when I was
21 when I sold my first story, and sent it all off. Editors were just immensely

02:20.720 --> 02:32.440
helpful. I never got form rejection slips, even at 14 years old. And you can
imagine the kind of junk you were writing at 14. But people like Sam Merwin, for

02:32.440 --> 02:42.180
example, would write me little notes, you know, we can't use this but keep
trying and so forth. And in effect, what really happened was that I got hooked

02:42.180 --> 02:53.800
on science fiction, and I just thought science fiction writers must be gods, and
I wanted to be one. And I figured that's as close to a god as I could get. So I

02:53.800 --> 02:58.720
went at it, and I kept writing until I sold my first story. And I've sold every
one I've written since.

03:06.240 --> 03:13.120
But Oliver was also pursuing an academic career, and he took a master's degree
in English from the University of Texas. His master's thesis was written on

03:13.120 --> 03:19.860
magazine science fiction, the first academic thesis written on that particular
subject. With a degree in English, you might have expected Oliver to become an

03:19.860 --> 03:30.960
English teacher or a full-time writer of science fiction. We asked him why he
didn't become either. Actually, I was briefly. After I got my MA, I taught

03:30.960 --> 03:41.820
English at the university for one year. And there were two troubles that were
involved in that situation. From my point of view, I don't know what troubles

03:41.820 --> 03:53.200
the students had. But the two troubles were basically that by the time I had
started to teach English, I was so much into anthropology that I already knew

03:53.200 --> 04:04.580
that that's what I wanted to do. And I really was just teaching the English
because I had told Ransom I would. And the other aspect of it was there's

04:04.580 --> 04:13.160
nothing like teaching freshman English for a year to convince you that that's
not what you want to do for the rest of your life. So that was the end of it. I

04:13.160 --> 04:22.120
left, then went to UCLA to graduate school in anthropology. I know that doesn't
answer the question about why I didn't become a full-time professional writer,

04:23.020 --> 04:34.620
but I'm not sure I can answer that question. And Tony Boucher once said to me,
sooner or later, you're going to have to choose. And I never did. And I suppose

04:34.620 --> 04:44.540
that one reason was that I was, particularly at that time, when I was, you know,
100 years younger than I am now, I was just as interested in anthropology as I

04:44.540 --> 04:54.600
was in writing. And I really wanted to teach anthropology. And so I tried to do
both, doubtless, within different success. More with science fiction author Chad

04:54.600 --> 04:55.420
Oliver next time.

05:02.600 --> 05:10.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:10.580 --> 05:11.340
Odessa, Texas.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.180
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:16.960 --> 06:22.280
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:24.980 --> 06:26.620
And here are your hosts.

06:30.480 --> 06:38.480
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. Chad Oliver has been publishing science
fiction for more than three decades. His novels include Shadows in the Sun, The

06:38.480 --> 06:44.960
Winds of Time, The Shores of Another Sea, and Giants in the Dust. He's also had
a couple of short story collections published, but he's always had to do his

06:44.960 --> 06:52.620
writing in his spare time. Professional anthropologist. He teaches anthropology
at the University of Texas at Austin, and he's also chairman of the anthropology

06:52.620 --> 07:05.480
department. Actually, I was chairman of the department of anthropology from 1967
to 1971. And when I resigned, I swore I would never do it again under any

07:05.480 --> 07:19.020
circumstances whatsoever. And so here I am in the third year of my second
chairmanship, and I figure I've got one year to go, and then somebody else is

07:19.020 --> 07:27.680
going to take over. And hopefully I can get back to writing, not on a full-time
basis, but I can sure write more than I can when I'm tied up with the

07:27.680 --> 07:35.700
chairmanship. It's really a full-time job. With a distinguished career at the
University, Oliver still spends time writing science fiction. We asked him why?

07:36.060 --> 07:50.580
For the money? No, I really think that writing is something you have to do. And
at any rate, that's the way it is with me. When I go a certain length of time

07:50.580 --> 08:03.980
without writing anything or trying to write something, I get actually physically
uncomfortable. And it's definitely a labor of love. I think of myself as an

08:03.980 --> 08:14.520
anthropologist who occasionally writes a story. I think that way down the
street, wherever it is I really live, what I am is a writer who got interested

08:14.520 --> 08:26.880
in anthropology rather than the other way around. And it means more to me, I
think. It's more gratifying to me than anything else I'd say. I just told a

08:26.880 --> 08:42.980
story to Analog, a story called "Ghost Town". It's going to be out in either the
September or October issue. And I was thrilled when Analog did it. And it's

08:42.980 --> 08:50.820
almost like I'd never told a story before. And it's infinitely important than
the other things that I did to me.

08:58.220 --> 09:05.360
Oliver is recognized for his use of anthropology and science fiction, and is
probably the first science fiction author to do so. He's even had one of his

09:05.360 --> 09:15.500
novels, Shadows in the Sun, reviewed in an anthropology journal. We asked him if
the use of anthropology was deliberate. To some extent, but it was certainly

09:15.500 --> 09:25.760
nothing that I sat down and planned. You know, like, here's an effective way to
teach anthropology, that I'm going to do it through science fiction. I really

09:25.760 --> 09:35.520
think that the actual truth of the situation is that any writer writes about all
the things that they know. And one of the things that I knew was anthropology.

09:36.020 --> 09:47.200
So it's more or less natural that a fair amount of my opinion is rooted in
anthropology. But by no means all of it. And it's too short of it. Particularly

09:47.200 --> 09:58.920
the stories that I like the most. I don't know whether anybody else likes it. It's kind of a story that doesn't have 
to be about anthropology at all. Although, you know, I don't even go on about this.

10:01.740 --> 10:08.700
But at the point of the influence that you can frequently ask much at the same time,

10:08.700 --> 10:09.480
and I'm just going to start with a question.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.660
Among them, what does it mean to be human?

10:13.300 --> 10:15.220
Where are we going and where are we going?

10:16.320 --> 10:24.520
And it seems to me that if you're involved seriously in the field, you tend to fall into the other one.

10:25.500 --> 10:30.040
I would guess, I don't know whether anybody's ever actually counted it up.

10:23.300 --> 10:40.360
But I suppose something like 50% of my
perhaps is rooted directly in anthropology. But 50% it isn't. We'll continue

10:40.360 --> 10:41.900
talking with Chad Oliver on our next show.

10:48.840 --> 10:56.680
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:56.680 --> 10:57.420
Odessa, Texas.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.980
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:04.620 --> 12:09.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.300
And here are your hosts.

12:39.960 --> 12:47.760
The idea is to have mankind start fresh, to see if he'll make the same mistakes
or take some alternate evolutionary path. With that plan in mind, the humans are

12:47.760 --> 12:55.380
left on the planet with no technological aid whatsoever. Varnum himself is a
throwback, a tough hunter who hasn't succumbed to the softness and lethargy of

12:55.380 --> 13:01.900
the rest of humanity. When the humans reach the point where they begin to
domesticate animals and practice agriculture, Varnum stops them. We asked Oliver

13:01.900 --> 13:10.040
why. Wouldn't Varnum's action and effect prevent civilization from developing?
Well, actually, the funny thing about Giants in the Dust, there are lots of

13:10.040 --> 13:20.160
funny things about Giants in the Dust, including the fact that that's not my
title. And I haven't the faintest idea of what Giants in the Dust means in the

13:20.160 --> 13:30.860
context of that particular novel. I called it Go Back, Go Back. But it's about a
kind of anthropology that most people are not familiar with. You know, almost

13:30.860 --> 13:43.920
all the anthropology in science fiction comes out, really, of the old Franz Boas
Ruth Benedict cultural relativism position. And there's a whole new school in

13:43.920 --> 13:54.460
anthropology, if you can call it a school, and not just in anthropology, because
it gets into sociobiology and all sorts of things, which states, in effect, you

13:54.460 --> 14:03.820
know, that there's more to human beings at birth than just being the traditional
tabula rasa, that there's some things built in. And what I was trying to do in

14:03.820 --> 14:14.420
Giants in the Dust, or what was going on there, was really to take the old deal
about, suppose you took 50 people, 25 male, 25 female, and you cast them away on

14:14.420 --> 14:25.540
the traditional desert island. What would happen to them if they could somehow
survive from infancy and grow into adulthood? And one possibility that hasn't

14:25.540 --> 14:37.920
been considered is that we have a kind of culture-building device within us, and
that we would recreate a good deal of culture much more quickly than is usually

14:37.920 --> 14:50.680
assumed. And I was playing around with that idea in Giants in the Dust. And the
reason why Varnum stops these various inventions and things is because he wants

14:50.680 --> 15:01.520
to give it time to unfold to see what will happen. But you may recall Varnum's
the only character in the book who retains any memory. And at the end of the

15:01.520 --> 15:13.500
book, he finally decides that ethically, the only thing he can do is to tell
him, tell the other people, what he remembers of the culture back on Earth, and

15:13.500 --> 15:17.500
to give them a fair shot at what's going on.

15:27.400 --> 15:38.460
We should not have developed our present civilization with its high level of
technology. No, I wasn't. I think you can construct an argument to the effect

15:38.460 --> 15:49.380
that people in other kinds of societies, particularly hunting and gathering
societies, have some things that we don't have. It's not all one-sided.

15:49.800 --> 16:01.640
Civilization is not an unmixed blessing. And people who live in those band
type of societies, they tend to be freer from stress. They tend to have fewer

16:01.640 --> 16:13.600
emotional problems than people who live in societies such as our own. And so I
don't think it's a completely insane argument to say, you know, maybe we'd all

16:13.600 --> 16:23.620
be better off if we were still hunters and gatherers. But no, it's not a
position I would advocate because I don't think it's a, it's not a realistic

16:23.620 --> 16:28.660
proposition outside the world of fantasy. More with Chad Oliver next time.

16:35.700 --> 16:43.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:43.580 --> 16:44.320
Odessa, Texas.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.800
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:49.440 --> 17:54.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.100
And here are your hosts.

18:03.220 --> 18:11.060
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. In a recent science fiction story, Chad
Oliver raises an interesting question. Can man colonize in space? Well, the human

18:11.060 --> 18:18.260
race split into two separate species, spacers and earthers. The story is
entitled, "Meanwhile Back on the Reservation", and has appeared in the 1981

18:18.260 --> 18:25.680
edition of Analog Magazine. As the title suggests, Earth becomes sort of a
reservation containing the backwash of human culture, while the other worlds,

18:25.760 --> 18:32.760
colonized by humans, become the progressive mainstream of mankind's culture. We
asked Oliver if he thought such a situation could occur as we move out into

18:32.760 --> 18:47.060
space. I think it's possible. I think it's possible. Really, the genesis of,
meanwhile, back on the reservation was twofold. And one was simply the kind of

18:47.060 --> 18:58.100
reaction that builds up in you when everybody talks about, hey, you know, here's
the glorious future coming onward to the stars, everybody. When you stop and

18:58.100 --> 19:13.000
realize everybody's not going. And in fact, 99.99% of the human population will
live and die on this planet. And you've got to wonder, well, what about them?

19:13.260 --> 19:25.180
Aren't they people too? And it's anthropological, I think, primarily in the
sense of they're in the same boat that so-called primitive peoples are on this

19:25.180 --> 19:38.060
planet today. That the march of culture, for want of another term, has passed
them by to some extent. And they're sort of islands that are left in the stream

19:38.060 --> 19:48.380
and left behind. And yet they have all the problems of living the face that
anybody else does. And I was just trying to raise the question, well, all right,

19:48.460 --> 19:56.480
what about the people who stay behind? Do we just write them off? Are they
ciphers? Or aren't they just as important as somebody that goes off to Alpha

19:56.480 --> 19:57.820
Centaurus or someplace?

20:03.560 --> 20:10.260
Oliver's been publishing science fiction for over 30 years. And for a good part
of that time, he's lived in Austin, Texas, and taught anthropology at the

20:10.260 --> 20:16.800
University of Texas. Oliver goes on to talk about Meanwhile Back on the
Reservation and reveals some interesting information about his background as a

20:16.800 --> 20:25.440
science fiction writer and also about science fiction writers in Texas. The
other thing that was involved in that story was that I had not written any short

20:25.440 --> 20:41.020
fiction in a while. And I got mixed up with the Turkey City Group in Austin,
which has been a source of untold joy in my life. And a number of people who

20:41.020 --> 20:51.260
were involved in that group, Lisa Tuttle and Howard Waldrop and a number of
others, had urged me to try to do something again, not wait so long between

20:51.260 --> 21:04.040
stories. And meanwhile, back on the reservations, actually the first story I
ever wrote that I submitted to a criticism from other writers. And I learned a

21:04.040 --> 21:15.580
lot from them. And it was a very rewarding experience. And I can't tell you what
a thrill it is for me to be living in some place like Austin and to find a whole

21:15.580 --> 21:25.240
colony of professional science fiction writers there. And not just there, but
the fact that they're so good. You know, for something like 20 years, I was all

21:25.240 --> 21:34.120
alone in Texas. The closest thing there was to a science fiction convention or
gathering in the old days was when Walt Miller and I got together for a six-pack

21:34.120 --> 21:47.020
of beer in Kyle. And this is a brand-new experience for me. And it's comparable
only to the situation I was in when I was in Los Angeles in graduate school. And

21:47.020 --> 21:56.520
Ray Bradbury and Chuck Beaumont and Bill Nolan and Dick Matheson and all of us
would get together and talk about stories. But we never criticized each other's

21:56.520 --> 22:05.060
manuscripts in a more or less formal session like that. Instead, you know,
somebody would write something, and if there was somebody they liked, they'd

22:05.060 --> 22:13.500
take a, hey, look at this, you know, you think I can do anything with it. And
then 20 years more or less by myself, really. More next time with Chad Oliver.

22:21.060 --> 22:28.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:28.840 --> 22:29.580
Odessa, Texas.

23:14.660 --> 23:18.620
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:34.360 --> 23:39.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:42.540 --> 23:44.080
And here are your hosts.

23:48.140 --> 23:56.220
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. The Shores of Another Sea, Chad Oliver's
1971 science fiction novel, was partially based on the author's experience when

23:56.220 --> 24:03.720
he did some anthropological research in Africa. The novel concerns alien
contact, a standard science fiction theme. The contact is made when some aliens

24:03.720 --> 24:11.060
land in a remote area of Africa. And the aliens are very cautious. They don't
present themselves to humans. They use baboons at first, studying them and

24:11.060 --> 24:18.220
taking over their bodies in order to approach men without being detected. But a
man named Royce Crawford, a scientist studying the baboons, becomes aware of the

24:18.220 --> 24:25.600
aliens' presence. He can't go for help, though, because a storm washes out the
roads and isolates him from civilization. We asked Oliver if the setting was

24:25.600 --> 24:42.780
based on the time he spent in Africa. Yes, it was. The Shores of Another Sea is
at least rooted in the 17 months or so that I spent in Kenya in East Africa when

24:42.780 --> 24:57.860
I was on a research job with a people called the Kamba. And some aspects of The
Shores of Another Sea are real. Some are invented, as is true in any fiction.

24:58.140 --> 25:12.640
But to be specific, the storm and the rains and the isolation that form a major
part of The Shores of Another Sea, that all happened. And I was marooned for a

25:12.640 --> 25:23.280
period of some weeks at what was that? I forget what I called it in the novel. I
may even have used its real name, which was the Derajani Research Station. And

25:23.280 --> 25:35.900
when those rains came down, they simply knocked out all communications. And the
thought just occurred to me. You know, suppose you were going to contact this

25:35.900 --> 25:46.900
Earth and you had to begin somewhere. Would you really plunk your ship down in
the middle of New York City the way they always do? Or would you try it first in

25:46.900 --> 25:56.240
a controllable type of situation where you could deal with small numbers and
related species? And wouldn't it be interesting if you started off with some

25:56.240 --> 26:05.700
other form of primate like a baboon? And that's where The Shores of Another Sea
came from. But if you go back and read the book, or at least if I go back and

26:05.700 --> 26:15.020
look at it, what I see are all kinds of detailed memories of what actually
happened in Kenya, right down to the level of the pipe tobacco I was smoking

26:15.020 --> 26:20.100
there, which was called Sweet Nut and came in a yellow tin and was perfectly
awful.

26:30.440 --> 26:37.620
At one point in the novel, Royce Crawford has a huge water buck in the sights of
his rifle. He's always dreamed of shooting this animal, but he chooses not to.

26:37.860 --> 26:49.800
We asked Oliver if Crawford's decision resulted from his experiences with the
aliens. Sure. The scene in which the would-be hunter finally has a chance to

26:49.800 --> 27:02.600
shoot the animal that he's always dreamed about and elects to let it go free,
that's an analog of what is going on in the rest of the book as well, which is

28:11.960 --> 28:14.420
Odessa, Texas.
