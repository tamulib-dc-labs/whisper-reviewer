00:02.520 --> 00:03.080
Another month.

00:05.540 --> 00:08.780
Alrighty. Let's see here.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.660
Jackie, do you see that?

00:14.460 --> 00:20.280
That's all there is. We have to turn the heated down.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.240
That's all there is.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.500
You say it hasn't been too cold out there?

00:27.180 --> 00:27.560
Excuse me?

00:27.560 --> 00:29.520
You say it hasn't been very cold out there?

00:29.720 --> 00:32.100
No, not really. We had one slight fall of snow

00:36.000 --> 00:38.420
about a week or more ago, and that was it.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.540
It's kind of a handy place to be.

00:40.740 --> 00:45.520
We're up at about 1800 feet, which is just below the snow line.

00:45.660 --> 00:48.220
The snow line, we're in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.

00:49.140 --> 00:50.620
So we'd get pretty high.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.900
But the snow line is something like, oh, 10 miles away.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.760
Go up in the snow if you want, but you don't have it on top of you.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.580
We're in the other direction. We're not that high from San Francisco.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.220
Alrighty. I've got a technical problem on this end.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.520
Alright, let's see if that cured it up.

01:09.100 --> 01:09.480
What's that?

01:10.280 --> 01:10.820
The loop.

01:12.040 --> 01:12.760
Do we have a loop?

01:14.020 --> 01:15.360
I don't detect one now.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.420
Oh, yeah, I guess I still got one here.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.740
Let's see if that got rid of it.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.040
Is that better?

01:23.780 --> 01:24.180
Nope.

01:25.540 --> 01:26.780
Alright, now let's see if it's gone.

01:27.360 --> 01:27.740
It's gone?

01:28.400 --> 01:30.820
Yeah, it's gone. Count to five for me, please.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.320
One, two, three, four, five.

01:33.680 --> 01:34.520
Looks good.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.200
Alrighty.

01:36.540 --> 01:37.000
I get it right.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.300
Yeah, we got it. We got it. We got it.

01:40.740 --> 01:42.560
Test, test, test, test.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.940
Test, test, test, test, test.

01:45.080 --> 01:45.480
Alright.

01:49.120 --> 01:49.520
Alrighty.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.640
You said it hadn't been too cold out there, didn't you?

01:54.140 --> 01:54.480
Right here?

01:54.940 --> 01:55.180
Yeah.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.620
No, it's been very mild here.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.120
Okay.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.180
We, uh...

02:04.180 --> 02:08.040
When we first arrived, we, uh...

02:08.040 --> 02:09.340
We thought it was a little chilly.

02:12.380 --> 02:16.300
Until we heard that Orlando had minus 29 the previous night.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.220
And then we didn't feel it was chilly.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.040
Okay, we've got the tape recorder rolling.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.260
Just one more time if you'd count to three for me, please.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.700
Oh, how about one, two, three?

02:29.580 --> 02:31.480
One, two, three. Looks good.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.360
I'm not getting a little louder.

02:34.360 --> 02:34.940
I'm not getting a little louder.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.400
That's the way it's supposed to be.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.900
I think a little louder if this is faint.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.640
No, that's pretty good.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.740
We're far and beyond where we were as far as audio recording goes.

02:44.740 --> 02:49.420
Now we do all sorts of mixing and jump with this in the studio

02:49.420 --> 02:51.040
after we get through recording it.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.480
I have every confidence in American media.

02:55.360 --> 02:55.860
Good.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.400
Alright, we're gonna go ahead and get started.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.160
Okay.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.220
Okay. Alright.

03:12.220 --> 03:14.220
How did you get interested in writing?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
It was too long ago to remember.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.220
When I left school at...

03:23.140 --> 03:25.660
when I was 16 and wanted to be a writer then,

03:26.620 --> 03:30.980
I guess it was something that I always enjoyed doing as a kid at school.

03:31.620 --> 03:35.000
You know, the essays and the story writing exercises you get.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.500
And when I left school I told the world I was gonna be a writer.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.400
And you could think of a good idea until somebody said,

03:44.460 --> 03:50.860
well, with all the accumulated wisdom and experience of 16 years,

03:50.980 --> 03:54.220
what are you gonna write about that the world is breathlessly waiting to hear?

03:55.460 --> 03:57.220
And I hadn't thought about that.

03:57.380 --> 03:58.460
The answer was not a lot.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.780
So I went away into engineering and electronics and computers and things like that

04:03.780 --> 04:05.000
for something like 20 years.

04:06.400 --> 04:13.160
And I suppose the interest in writing probably never went away.

04:13.900 --> 04:19.140
And 20 odd years later, that situation had changed a lot.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.700
I'd spent a lot of that time.

04:20.740 --> 04:24.700
I started off as an electronics engineer and then a computer designer

04:24.700 --> 04:27.320
and then went into selling computer systems.

04:29.720 --> 04:36.400
And not the blue boxes you see at work that print out payrolls and things.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.220
I'm not talking about business computers,

04:38.460 --> 04:45.900
but the real-time scientific systems that might go into scientific research laboratories

04:45.900 --> 04:50.160
are connected up to instruments to collect all the data

04:50.160 --> 04:52.040
and turn them into pictures on screens.

04:52.040 --> 04:58.400
And the sort of computers you'd find in particle accelerator installations

04:58.400 --> 05:00.840
or observatories.

05:01.300 --> 05:08.620
In other words, all my customers were scientists, physicists, biologists, chemists, and so forth.

05:09.400 --> 05:15.020
And the kind of system we're talking about ranged up to several million dollars.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.040
And when somebody's buying a system of that size,

05:18.040 --> 05:21.380
it's not the kind of thing that you sell in a one-half hour sales call

05:22.120 --> 05:27.520
and say, sign the paper, you're frequently working with them for 12, maybe 18 months

05:28.800 --> 05:31.300
before a contract is finalized.

05:31.920 --> 05:36.400
During that time, you have to try and understand a lot of what they're doing

05:36.400 --> 05:44.460
in terms of to be able to put together and recommend the right sort of system for their needs.

05:44.460 --> 05:48.020
In other words, you get to know a little bit of what they're all doing.

05:48.980 --> 05:52.840
And I found it fascinating, a fascinating world that they lived in.

05:56.540 --> 06:01.660
You also get to know them socially, how they think, how they take, what makes them laugh.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.600
Very interesting as people.

06:04.460 --> 06:08.380
And I found 20 years later that there were a lot of interesting things to put here

06:08.380 --> 06:11.040
to write about and form the basis of stories.

06:11.040 --> 06:16.240
So I didn't particularly set out to be a science fiction writer.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.800
I suppose I became one by accident.

06:18.660 --> 06:23.420
I just always wanted to write and started writing stories about the little bit of life

06:23.420 --> 06:28.920
that I'd had some personal experience of and was told I was a science fiction writer.

06:29.140 --> 06:29.840
And I said, how's that?

06:30.280 --> 06:34.080
They said, well, the publisher is publishing it under their science fiction input.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.980
So we guess you have to be so I said, OK.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.820
And it kind of started out like that.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.280
OK. Could you hold for just a second here?

06:42.500 --> 06:45.480
I've got to take care of a slight flutter in one of my machines.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.760
OK. Hang on. I'll be right back with you.

06:51.860 --> 06:52.380
Still here.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.900
OK. You've covered a lot of the background already.

06:56.300 --> 06:56.980
Is there a problem?

06:58.060 --> 07:00.480
I'm just getting a funny scraping noise off of real type.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.740
So it's not going to be really picking up anyway.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.580
So we'll just leave it.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.420
Are we going away?

07:05.680 --> 07:07.560
No, it's sitting there just scraping away.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.520
But the heck with it.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.760
You've covered a lot of the background stuff, like I said.

07:13.820 --> 07:16.620
So I'll think I'll go right into some other stuff.

07:20.140 --> 07:25.520
Associating with the scientists as you were, I guess that gave you a lot of the background material that you use in your stories.

07:25.960 --> 07:26.300
Yeah.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.660
Well, that provided more to trigger.

07:32.200 --> 07:37.520
The stimulation to take an interest in that kind of work, I guess reading provided a lot of it.

07:38.760 --> 07:44.880
But that kind of material is easy to read when you have a vested interest in understanding it,

07:44.940 --> 07:51.720
because you have business relationships that will profit from that understanding.

07:51.940 --> 07:57.420
In other words, it's reading with a purpose, a clear-cut purpose rather than just out of curiosity.

07:57.420 --> 08:01.700
It's a way of dealing with the idea of a way of killing time.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.680
But luckily it became a little more than that.

08:08.580 --> 08:11.500
Do you usually do a lot of back-up here?

08:14.260 --> 08:17.560
Most of your stories, I guess, would be called hard science fiction.

08:17.880 --> 08:18.020
Yeah.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.900
Do you do a lot of research whenever you do write a story?

08:22.540 --> 08:23.180
Yeah, I do.

08:25.540 --> 08:31.280
I suppose I read quite a lot, and I suppose the bulk of my reading is nonfiction.

08:31.760 --> 08:39.440
So even casual reading in a way becomes what might be termed non-specific research.

08:39.660 --> 08:43.100
In other words, information that just gets stored away and comes out later,

08:43.100 --> 08:47.200
although I didn't study it for any particular reason at the time.

08:49.420 --> 08:55.380
But while I was, before I became a full-time writer, I was still working in the computer business.

08:55.640 --> 09:02.200
I used to, I made use of my customers pretty freely as consultants, which was kind of handy.

09:02.420 --> 09:08.340
I found that I had customers who were brain surgeons and other customers who studied pieces

09:08.340 --> 09:13.460
of rock brought back from the Apollo missions and other guys who were building in,

09:13.460 --> 09:16.180
or investigating machine intelligence.

09:16.440 --> 09:22.940
And just about any of the topics, or the favorite themes of science fiction that you could take out of a hat,

09:24.440 --> 09:29.260
the chances were sort of not 10 to 1, I had a customer specializing in that field.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.720
And I just had to, if I needed some background information on a particular topic,

09:34.300 --> 09:38.980
I could almost guarantee I had a phone number in my diary as a guy who could talk all day about it.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.180
And they love doing it as well, I used to call them and they'd say,

09:44.200 --> 09:45.420
I'd like to come and talk to you tomorrow.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.100
Well, we're a little busy, but what's it about?

09:49.300 --> 09:52.100
Oh, I need some help with the book I'm working on.

09:52.220 --> 09:54.280
Well, why didn't you say so? What times do you want to show up?

09:54.540 --> 09:55.620
And they talk all day.

09:56.680 --> 10:07.820
And I think this is one of the interesting sides of selling computers into this kind of area.

10:07.820 --> 10:14.960
You can imagine some of these specialists, they talk to bacteria all day long or whatever

10:14.960 --> 10:18.000
and they end up shutting the back rooms of universities.

10:18.920 --> 10:23.040
And maybe there are four people on the planet they can talk to who understand their language.

10:23.440 --> 10:33.060
And sometimes they find it hard to believe that somebody from the world outside that has walked in off the street

10:33.060 --> 10:40.760
is sincerely interested to sit down and talk to them and is curious and he wants to know what they're doing,

10:40.900 --> 10:41.860
wants to have it explained.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.440
And it was a very pleasant way to work a living.

10:46.080 --> 10:54.120
You not only gain customers, in many instances I found you gain friends as well.

10:56.260 --> 11:04.380
It's a very pleasant combination to build a life around where the things you like doing,

11:07.420 --> 11:14.280
the kind of work that you like to do, the kind of activity that you like to do is also part of a process

11:14.280 --> 11:17.880
of making friends and not only that somebody is prepared to pay you to do it.

11:18.820 --> 11:20.620
I found that a very pleasant situation.

11:21.820 --> 11:28.040
Your first novel, in fact I believe it was the first thing that you wrote was In Hair of the Stars, wasn't it?

11:28.040 --> 11:28.260
Yes it was.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.320
It's a science fiction detective story.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.000
Yes.

11:33.580 --> 11:37.200
How did you come to write that book?

11:38.400 --> 11:41.420
Well, I think that sums it up pretty well.

11:41.420 --> 11:53.600
It reflects I think the way I see science which is indeed as a wonderful, ongoing, never-ending detective story.

11:55.280 --> 12:05.040
And I suppose I got a little bit dissatisfied with some of the depictions of science and scientists that I'd seen in fiction.

12:07.160 --> 12:18.820
I found the impression or the suspicion in some cases that perhaps the people who had written some of the fiction

12:18.820 --> 12:25.960
certainly would perhaps not have worked in a scientific field or spoken to a scientist for a long, long time

12:25.960 --> 12:30.560
and maybe generations of people had reinforced each other's cliches.

12:30.560 --> 12:37.280
And scientists were always eccentric and they wore odd colour shoes and they drew cabbages that ate people

12:37.280 --> 12:39.520
and they wanted to conquer the world or something.

12:40.800 --> 12:50.620
And there are these kind of cute public impressions of scientists as people who run down the street with no clothes on, shouting Eureka

12:56.660 --> 13:04.320
or have you read phrases like it came to him in a flash and you read on

13:04.320 --> 13:10.280
and what came to him in a flash would have been enough to keep Einstein busy for the next 20 years.

13:10.980 --> 13:23.820
And real science, there are insights, there are strokes of genius, but the overwhelming bulk of the work is done by a lot of unsung heroes,

13:24.020 --> 13:32.160
a lot of people doing nothing really dramatic or exciting but just meticulously sifting through details and collecting information.

13:33.380 --> 13:41.760
For generations and for centuries, all different parts of the world and it's really like putting together a huge jigsaw puzzle,

13:41.900 --> 13:48.420
lots of people cutting out pieces and twisting them round and every now and again somebody will take a huge chunk in this corner

13:48.420 --> 13:51.760
and see that it fits with a huge chunk down there and that's a breakthrough.

13:52.360 --> 13:56.480
And so it goes on and it really is a detective story.

13:56.780 --> 13:59.380
I think it's a far more exciting one than most detective fiction.

13:59.380 --> 14:11.860
And I wanted to write a story that attempted to depict it in this kind of way and hopefully would convey some of the excitement that personally I feel when I look at this whole thing.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.900
I believe so.

14:13.900 --> 14:28.780
I think that, I thought that, yeah, let's make it a detective story, but if we want a detective mystery that is going to be sufficiently intriguing

14:28.780 --> 14:34.160
to motivate the large proportion of the scientific community as happened in Inherit the Stars,

14:34.860 --> 14:41.020
we want something a little more original and exciting than bodies in the library or footprints in the flower bed.

14:42.440 --> 14:46.960
So we invented Charlie and the aliens and the rest I suppose you know.

14:49.280 --> 14:55.660
Basically it was an attempt to depict science as it is or at least as I perceive it.

14:56.420 --> 15:07.460
And at the same time we've added into a story that people who were non-scientists, non-specialists would find stimulating and rousing to the curiosity

15:08.120 --> 15:17.180
even if without trying to turn it into a 250 page lab report or something like that.

15:17.620 --> 15:32.760
Yeah, I believe, I don't know if I'm reading this into your work or not, but some of what I'm feeling is that your writing is sort of almost a celebration of learning, the learning process.

15:32.760 --> 15:37.860
Yes, I think it's one of the most exciting processes anybody can experience.

15:38.720 --> 15:50.840
I think it's very sad that in large sections of our culture we should have evolved the attitude that learning is something you endure until you leave school

15:50.840 --> 16:03.800
and then it ceases with that or I think education and living are just different aspects of the same process that never ends.

16:07.540 --> 16:18.300
In the minds of a lot of people the two teams seem to have separated out and for some reason learning is looked upon as hard work

16:18.300 --> 16:22.460
and unpleasant and something that you steer clear of unless you can't avoid it.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.500
I think that's very, very sad.

16:25.080 --> 16:30.240
No reason why it should be so, I think it's just a consequence of cultural expectations.

16:30.580 --> 16:35.680
A lot of people expect it to be hard work and tedious and sure enough it is.

16:37.340 --> 16:43.960
In your stories I've noticed that you really flesh out the futures that you create with a lot of detail.

16:48.660 --> 16:49.900
I lost my question.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.340
You were saying about the future.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.300
Yeah, let me just rephrase it here.

16:59.180 --> 17:02.000
I notice in your stories that you really fleshed them out with a lot of detail.

17:03.840 --> 17:08.140
Does that simply just make the story more realistic?

17:11.520 --> 17:14.840
I don't know if there's any particular purpose in doing that.

17:14.840 --> 17:26.260
I try and use as much detail as I feel is needed to convey whatever meaning I'm trying to convey at that particular part of the book.

17:30.060 --> 17:35.780
In fact, some parts I got over very quickly because there's really not a lot to say.

17:39.980 --> 17:45.240
I don't know if you have any specific examples in mind that we could talk about more particularly.

17:47.440 --> 17:55.980
I think the short answer is I simply make descriptions, etc. as detailed as I feel they need to be to say what I want to say.

17:56.480 --> 18:02.680
I was remembering one particular instance when Hades traveling from England to the United States

18:02.680 --> 18:09.920
and he opens up his briefcase and plugs in his video phone to the plane and makes this long distance call right there.

18:11.200 --> 18:22.620
It seems so natural that it just creates a very realistic atmosphere for your story.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.520
Yeah, I like to do things like that.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.500
I see what you mean by detail now.

18:28.500 --> 18:38.060
I think these kinds of details do matter because if we're putting a story into a futuristic setting,

18:39.900 --> 18:49.800
I think the little details of background such as if the guy needs to make a phone call, how does he go about it if he needs to render CAD,

18:50.800 --> 18:59.100
these matter because if the story is being told in the future, the whole of the background has to be consistently futuristic.

19:01.280 --> 19:09.320
I've come across a number of instances which in my opinion are a little flawed because I've dealt with an AW.

19:11.300 --> 19:20.320
A writer may have seized on a particular thought, maybe a new scientific idea or a machine or whatever,

19:21.460 --> 19:29.300
develops that very well but kind of gets hung up on it and in the background everything else that's going on hasn't changed since 1980.

19:33.120 --> 19:38.400
I think just stop typing for the five minutes it takes just to think about a situation.

19:38.640 --> 19:45.960
The guy's going to make a phone call just like stop and think how he might make that and think about it for five minutes

19:45.960 --> 19:55.900
and then maybe show it in a way different to what would have been the impulsive thing to do in the first couple of seconds.

19:56.720 --> 20:04.080
It's worth the effort, I don't think it radically changes the story but it does give it that finishing polish as it were at least in that sense.

20:05.580 --> 20:09.560
I try to do this in all the stories and I find the readers like it.

20:09.560 --> 20:25.520
I think the people who write to me and the people that I meet, one of the gratifying things I observe in the readership that I have is that

20:25.520 --> 20:36.960
it is not confined to what might be termed the hardcore science fiction reader who buys anything new that appears on the science fiction section of the bookstores.

20:38.680 --> 20:52.960
I suppose people who might be termed younger professional people in their late 20s, 30s, 40s in all manner of professions not necessarily to do with the scientists, teachers, lawyers, doctors, so forth

20:54.260 --> 21:03.440
who typically would say gee I used to read science fiction when I was at college or when I was at university but I kind of grew out of it.

21:04.540 --> 21:10.020
I can't relate to the way out galaxies light years away anymore or aliens running around with ray guns.

21:10.820 --> 21:16.080
Today I have a family, a career, a mortgage, my feet are solidly on the surface of this planet.

21:17.080 --> 21:26.920
But they seem to like stories that don't kind of try and take them to the other side of the universe a million years from now but maybe just stretch the future 20 or 30 years.

21:26.920 --> 21:36.660
And they find names in the book like IBM and Papers and Boeing, familiar places and grabs them.

21:36.880 --> 21:42.060
They say well this I can relate to it's the world that I live in just stretched a little bit.

21:42.240 --> 21:48.700
The connection is not broken, the economics and the politics have evolved and what I read in the papers I can still see the connections.

21:48.700 --> 21:52.800
And it could be the world my kids go up in and I like it.

21:52.800 --> 22:07.960
And if it has that effect on that far off the market of readership then I'm perfectly happy to continue doing that in addition to the reason that I enjoy the stories better myself for doing that.

22:09.960 --> 22:14.220
I wouldn't be misreading and saying you're an optimistic person would I?

22:15.300 --> 22:16.200
I think I am.

22:17.380 --> 22:21.040
And notice your stories tend to be rather optimistic.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.240
Sure, why not?

22:25.220 --> 22:26.800
Good question, why not?

22:28.400 --> 22:35.520
I think there's enough doom and gloom around I try and contribute something to counterbalance all that. I think it's needed.

22:38.200 --> 22:42.660
You probably would hold a great hope for the human potential then.

22:44.540 --> 22:46.460
Excuse me, I missed the question.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.920
You probably would hold a great hope for the human potential.

22:50.340 --> 23:07.580
Oh I think it's unlimited. It doesn't guarantee we'll use it correctly and wisely at all. There's no guarantee of that but I have no doubt that the potential exists and the choice is entirely up to us.

23:08.400 --> 23:21.460
And I think that in itself is grounds for optimism. It means that we're not pawns that are pushed around by fate or magical, mystical forces that we have no control over our future.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.480
I think that would be a very depressing thought.

23:24.840 --> 23:28.700
I think it underlies a lot of the philosophies that we hear astounded.

23:29.480 --> 23:37.300
I want to excuse to quit trying to write everything off as futile.

23:38.140 --> 23:50.720
I don't subscribe to this at all. I think that in the same way that the individual future lies in his or her hands and I think they have infinite potential to build upon.

23:50.720 --> 23:58.240
I think the only resource that we're short on in some quarters is positive thinking and the right attitude of mind.

23:59.280 --> 24:02.360
Nothing else. And I think collectively the same is true.

24:04.060 --> 24:14.700
I think that there is a human tendency to be too conscious of our failings and our faults and our mistakes which have happened.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.780
It would be silly to deny that.

24:18.300 --> 24:25.260
But I think by and large we've achieved some remarkable and wonderful things as well and continue to do so.

24:25.420 --> 24:31.240
And I think when I look at the bottom line of the balance sheet, I'm pretty proud to be a member of the human race.

24:38.580 --> 24:41.840
Okay. We're just commenting on here. I happen to agree with you.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.760
Could you hold for just a second here? We're going to shut the machine down.

24:47.420 --> 24:52.500
Zero just said go ahead and continue. He just stopped and I had just stopped the machine to find out what it was that he said.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.780
That was sort of redundant on my part. Okay. Machines crank back up and.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.060
We're rolling again.

25:02.120 --> 25:13.000
Okay. In your novel, Thrice Upon a Time, you base the story around a device that can send messages back in time to itself 24 hours in the past.

25:13.340 --> 25:17.400
And then by that process just keep sending it back to itself and back to itself.

25:18.780 --> 25:24.800
I've been reading recently about several scientists who are speculating about real possibilities of time travel.

25:24.800 --> 25:25.280
Yeah.

25:27.380 --> 25:34.540
Was your novel, your novel really was written before those came out. It's sort of prophetic in a way.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.900
Maybe that's where they got it from.

25:39.260 --> 25:41.220
Well, I don't know whether it's prophetic or not.

25:41.700 --> 25:51.920
Well, as is elaborated in the book itself, if something like that ever became a fact, there are some pretty interesting problems that are going to have to be solved.

25:52.660 --> 25:59.920
And our ideas of logic and cause and effect are going to have to undergo some pretty interesting revisions.

26:00.400 --> 26:04.360
So I'm certainly not setting myself up as a prophet saying yes, it'll happen.

26:05.620 --> 26:13.820
Maybe I don't know. I think history has shown that impossible or it'll never happen are very dangerous phrases to use in any context.

26:14.660 --> 26:22.260
As far as I was concerned, it was just a fun basis for a story, certainly not an original one.

26:22.940 --> 26:28.320
Although I did, I was trying, I don't suppose any of the things I've written about have been original in essence.

26:28.600 --> 26:33.360
I'd try and approach them from hopefully fresh and different angles.

26:34.160 --> 26:41.000
But for some time, for a number of years, in fact, before I wrote Thrice Upon a Time, I'd been wanting to write a timeshap or book for a number of reasons.

26:41.900 --> 26:58.360
Firstly, I wanted to attempt to face up to the paradoxes, the logical paradoxes, once and for all, and answer them without top-outs, without convenient coincidences,

26:59.400 --> 27:06.360
and without obliging characters who just happened to do the right thing to make everything come out the way the author said.

27:10.540 --> 27:20.020
And secondly, I wanted to get away from this kind of cliche of some kind of a conjurer's box, described or described as whatever,

27:20.200 --> 27:23.480
that you jump into and you jump out of and you're in some other time.

27:25.320 --> 27:34.220
We seem too many conjurer's boxes and it seemed to me unrealistic that if I ever built a box like that and I thought it was going to take me to another time,

27:34.220 --> 27:36.900
I certainly would jump into it and press the button.

27:37.960 --> 27:43.000
I mean, I would conduct a long series of tests and experiments first and none of that here I was ever thinking to do this.

27:43.740 --> 27:55.020
And it seemed to me reasonable to say if we're going to make the speculation of influencing the past, it seemed to me to be reasonable to speculate

27:55.020 --> 28:05.220
that if we're going to make that assumption anyway, that before we move structured objects and people back into another time,

28:05.520 --> 28:08.820
we probably learn how to inject energy first.

28:09.880 --> 28:17.640
And if you can send energy back in time, you can obviously switch the energy on and off and modulate it and send information.

28:18.500 --> 28:22.500
In other words, you can send messages to yourself if you like.

28:23.360 --> 28:33.220
I didn't want it to be a million years or a billion years or some huge span of time where really nothing that you did could make any difference.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.520
How about a lab bench experiment, ten minutes?

28:36.480 --> 28:41.560
You can just send a little signal back to yourself ten minutes ago and change what you've already done.

28:41.860 --> 28:45.520
This is interesting. You're hard up against the paradoxes now.

28:45.680 --> 28:49.300
You can't find a way around them or duck them.

28:49.300 --> 28:51.220
You've got to answer the question, what happened?

28:52.420 --> 28:59.960
The logic of the whole situation becomes absolutely...it drives you to the point of insanity trying to figure it out.

29:00.540 --> 29:09.860
I found the only way to do it was to think in terms of the simplest possible lab bench experiment that you could devise and strip away all the complications

29:09.860 --> 29:15.820
to just get the logic right and then elaborate it back up to the level that would make a story interesting.

29:16.540 --> 29:20.180
The simplest situation that you can think of is a button and a lamp.

29:20.520 --> 29:24.800
When you push the button, the lamp comes on. It couldn't get much simpler than that.

29:25.760 --> 29:37.960
The only different thing here is the lamp comes on ten seconds before you press the button because the signal goes back in time.

29:38.340 --> 29:41.900
The question is obvious, what happens? I wait until the lamp comes on.

29:42.700 --> 29:47.300
Ten seconds later it's time to press the button. It's not going to press it. Nobody could make me.

29:47.420 --> 29:53.060
I didn't want mystical forces compelling people to do something they didn't want to do.

29:55.880 --> 30:00.140
I wanted to preserve human free will. So what happens? I don't press the button.

30:00.900 --> 30:08.260
Conversely, I can say, well, the lamp didn't come on, but I'm going to press the button anyway.

30:08.260 --> 30:14.620
What happens? So those are two situations, one being the inverse of the other.

30:14.760 --> 30:22.820
If you can explain what happens, you can answer any time travel paradox because every one is an elaboration of one of those situations or the other.

30:23.540 --> 30:37.500
It's not good enough to, for example, wait for the lamp to come on and say,

30:37.500 --> 30:46.460
hey, what's this? Press the button. That doesn't get you out of it because, you're a scientist, you're going to repeat your experiment under conditions where that could happen.

30:46.600 --> 30:52.160
You lock the door and set it up again. You go out of the room and have the computer press the button.

30:52.320 --> 31:02.500
But eventually you would test it time and time and time again and if accidents happened that got you out of a mess for the first time, you could eliminate them the next time.

31:02.500 --> 31:08.040
And eventually you have to face up to that question, what happens? That's what I wanted to do.

31:08.220 --> 31:25.420
And the third thing I wanted to do was to tell a story in which the time machine itself and the staggering conceptual changes in physics and philosophy that are implied are relevant to the story that's being told.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.960
There's an integral part of it. If you took them away, there wouldn't be any story.

31:31.840 --> 31:49.100
I think in too many stories, time machines are used like Starships. They're just a device, a vehicle to get some characters into an unusual environment and then tell a pretty routine story that would stole them from Greek mythology or European medieval history.

31:49.720 --> 31:53.380
And the technology doesn't come into the story at all. They could have gone the on a greyhound bus.

31:54.340 --> 32:17.640
I didn't want to do that. And so the story was about some physicists who had stumbled upon this phenomenon and had realized that if what they were seeing meant what they thought it meant, it meant that they could actually inject information into the past and change the past with all the questions that implied.

32:19.660 --> 32:28.580
And being proceeded to test this phenomenon and the pains and very, very strange results.

32:29.400 --> 32:37.900
And yet they're convinced that behind all this there is some consistent system of super logic that does make sense and they're trying to figure out the rules of it.

32:40.540 --> 32:46.000
And of course there's an unspoken or unwritten invitation for the reader to participate.

32:46.740 --> 32:56.020
And again, I suppose it's a kind of a detective story. Not so much of who's done it, but how is it done to see if the reader can figure out the rules before the characters do?

32:59.180 --> 33:08.340
It is something that I noticed when I was reading the novel is that there are no unresolved paradoxes in it. You do sew them all up neatly before the end of the novel.

33:08.540 --> 33:12.880
Well that was one of the goals of writing the book. And I think it worked.

33:13.180 --> 33:20.220
The people who seem to know what they're talking about and have commented are pretty satisfied. So that made me pretty satisfied.

33:21.000 --> 33:30.660
There are a couple of silly things in there which don't really affect the physics of the time machine.

33:31.200 --> 33:40.140
There was a big fusion planned up in Scotland and I don't know why due to a lapse of concentration on my part in one chapter it had moved to another part of Scotland.

33:40.660 --> 33:46.460
We'll fix that when the book's next reprinted. There was an eagle eyed Scotsman wrote to me and picked that out.

33:50.760 --> 33:58.600
It started off on the soul way first and ended up on the Murray first or the other way round. I got it on the wrong first in one chapter.

33:59.020 --> 34:02.940
Well maybe for one of your future novels you'll have to explore matter transmitters.

34:03.540 --> 34:05.340
Yeah, yeah well it's a...

34:07.340 --> 34:17.500
Yeah that's another possibility. I did explore that in a short story I wrote called Assassin which was in the Stella anthology series. Stella number four.

34:20.820 --> 34:24.740
This was exploring the possibility of matter transmission and of course people.

34:26.320 --> 34:33.400
You can instantly get somebody from here to there but in fact what appears there is a copy of them so you've now got two of them.

34:34.360 --> 34:39.780
If the other one decides to come back the same way you're getting rapidly multiplying problems literally.

34:41.540 --> 34:44.060
Stella Assassin was a story that played around with that book.

34:44.900 --> 34:46.220
I must have missed that one.

34:46.220 --> 34:49.200
Since Stella four it came out a couple years ago.

34:49.620 --> 34:57.060
Okay. You've written a sequel to the Inherit the Stars called the General Giants of Ganymede.

34:57.060 --> 35:03.360
Did you intend to follow the story in Inherit the Stars with a sequel or was it from Reader Demand or what?

35:04.220 --> 35:10.940
A bit of both. When I wrote Inherit the Stars I had three books in mind. I had a trilogy in mind.

35:12.060 --> 35:17.820
So I put the hooks in...although Inherit the Stars was a complete story in itself.

35:18.380 --> 35:24.300
It didn't leave the reader hanging. It started and told and finished a story.

35:24.840 --> 35:33.260
Nevertheless there were a couple of hooks in there that invited some questions which were paved the way to a follow up book.

35:36.140 --> 35:49.480
My thinking at the time was I'll go that far but I won't write the second book until I have some feedback as to how the readers liked the first one.

35:50.540 --> 35:55.200
I got a lot of mail and they all liked it and a lot of them said in their letters will there be a follow up?

35:55.360 --> 35:58.700
They picked out the hooks. So I wrote the General Giants.

36:00.480 --> 36:05.960
And they wanted another one and I did have a trilogy in mind when I wrote it.

36:06.080 --> 36:12.640
And the third one in that series is now written. It's called Giant Star and it will be...it's a July title.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.940
So it should start to appear in the bookstores around June.

36:17.160 --> 36:20.280
It's the third and last. There won't be any more in that series.

36:21.400 --> 36:26.180
So it ties up a few of the loose ends. Tells another story.

36:30.540 --> 36:34.980
Continues with the characters we met in the previous two books.

36:35.120 --> 36:38.600
Both the Terrestrial and the Ae of Characters and introduces some new ones.

36:39.780 --> 36:44.760
And I don't think there can be a fourth one because I don't think there's any more to be said. It wraps it all up.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.560
Are you working on any new projects?

36:51.020 --> 36:54.860
I'm working on the...as I say, Giant Star will be out in June-July.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.180
And I'm currently working on the one after that.

36:59.260 --> 37:03.140
Which I don't have a title for yet because I always think of the title as last.

37:04.860 --> 37:08.340
And I don't know when it'll be on sale because I don't know when I'll finish it.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.220
Probably sometime this spring.

37:12.060 --> 37:15.740
What type of story is it without giving away any of the plot details?

37:15.920 --> 37:18.360
Well, it's...how can we sum it up?

37:25.540 --> 37:26.180
It's...permissive.

37:27.240 --> 37:35.120
Well, the background to the story is that we're in the second half of the next century.

37:36.320 --> 37:42.600
And some decades previously, in other words, in about...about around the year 2020,

37:44.100 --> 37:47.340
a robot star probe was sent out.

37:52.440 --> 37:58.860
Programmed to tour a number of stars and simply to search for habitable planets and generally explore.

37:59.500 --> 38:03.460
Send down surface probes, atmospheric probes, things like that.

38:03.900 --> 38:04.940
Radio everything back.

38:07.940 --> 38:15.080
And the political situation on Earth was looking very, very grave at that time.

38:15.340 --> 38:20.100
I am an optimist but I can still invent rule of all three scenarios for a story, though it's fiction after all.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.520
The optimism may turn out to be unjustified yet.

38:23.520 --> 38:37.480
But towards the closing years of this project, in other words, obviously you don't build a ship like that overnight,

38:38.260 --> 38:48.900
and when it was well along the way towards being completed, it was modified to be capable of making people.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.540
Let me qualify that as a strange thing to say.

38:53.200 --> 38:57.720
We'll read a lot of stories about starships that go on long voyages that take maybe centuries

38:57.720 --> 39:02.840
and inevitably they've got frozen bodies or bodies in suspended animation or something like that.

39:04.940 --> 39:08.580
But when you think about it, it seems rather an inefficient way to send...you know,

39:08.580 --> 39:12.440
you're not doing anything, the machines can fly the ship, the computers can get it there.

39:13.120 --> 39:17.940
The people aren't doing anything about...except, you know, just lying there freezing.

39:17.940 --> 39:23.960
So, you know, why not let the machines fly the ship and make the people when you get there?

39:24.700 --> 39:31.400
If we look at the progress made in molecular biology and genetic engineering in the last couple of decades,

39:32.220 --> 39:39.100
we already manufactured quite complex organic molecules to specifications such as drugs and certain anaesthetics.

39:39.900 --> 39:44.780
If we just extrapolate that a little further, it's to say you couldn't make a complete set of human DNA.

39:45.480 --> 39:51.620
In other words, instead of sending bodies and all the support equipment to freeze them and taking up all the space,

39:51.700 --> 40:03.020
why not just store all the genetic information necessary to make people electronically in the computers

40:03.900 --> 40:10.480
and create them when you have found the planet that the instruments say they could survive on?

40:12.100 --> 40:17.480
And, you know, let's imagine for a sake of argument that ten light years away you found the planet.

40:17.660 --> 40:22.680
Well, if the robot ship got there and sent back a signal saying, started the experiment,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.660
well, ten years later the signal gets to Earth.

40:27.340 --> 40:32.580
And even if they responded instantly, the ship's been in orbit for twenty years doing nothing,

40:32.680 --> 40:33.720
just waiting for a reply.

40:33.840 --> 40:39.920
Well, the ultimate test of whether or not a planet is inevitable is to set up a colony and try it.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.060
And so we could have used those twenty years.

40:44.240 --> 40:55.520
So here is the interesting possibility of a race that evolves from a first generation of embryos

40:55.520 --> 41:01.360
that were created and nurtured and raised by computers and robots, a machine-raised race.

41:02.320 --> 41:09.620
And when you think about it, the relationship between the children and the machines does not really have to be a cold

41:09.620 --> 41:10.800
and sinister one at all.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.940
It could be quite a charming and amusing one.

41:16.800 --> 41:24.060
And the interesting thoughts that the book starts to play with is, here is a race of kids that are being raised by

41:27.100 --> 41:34.500
some very rational, direct, down-to-earth entities who don't double talk or deceive

41:34.500 --> 41:38.540
or have all these layers of human game-playing that we have to contend with.

41:39.960 --> 41:50.560
And they're being raised completely without any exposure to the conditioning of conditioned adults

41:50.560 --> 41:54.920
with their prejudices and hatreds and taboos.

41:55.440 --> 41:59.920
And a lot of the other nonsense is that make life so complicated in our society.

42:01.900 --> 42:06.460
And also, they're not a primitive society, they're a very high-technology society.

42:06.660 --> 42:12.120
They arrive with some of the most advanced equipment and technology ever devised.

42:16.380 --> 42:22.100
While they were in orbit and growing up serenity, the machines were down on the surface,

42:22.260 --> 42:27.140
preparing surface bases, manufacturing facilities and industries and so forth.

42:27.140 --> 42:35.100
So by the time they actually enter adolescence and the races, the generations I should say,

42:35.160 --> 42:44.140
that follow thereafter, all of their material needs are provided by highly automated means.

42:44.800 --> 42:51.260
In terms of their productivity relative to their numbers, everyone is a millionaire.

42:53.700 --> 42:57.620
And let's imagine that a mission from Earth eventually shows up.

43:00.640 --> 43:04.760
Virtually, you know, a big mission. This is usually a 20-year voyage, maybe.

43:05.740 --> 43:09.580
So we're talking about a spaceship that maybe houses 20,000 people,

43:09.960 --> 43:16.000
a space colony with engines, with its government, its military, its church organizations,

43:16.000 --> 43:23.320
its commercial institutions, the whole of society in miniature with its time-proved mechanisms

43:23.320 --> 43:26.680
for controlling and subordinating a population.

43:27.620 --> 43:37.220
Which traditionally, a ruling elite through history is imposed itself by restricting the flow of wealth

43:37.220 --> 43:42.140
and by offering protection either from real or imagined threats.

43:42.700 --> 43:50.480
But how do you control a race of millionaires who don't need your wealth

43:50.480 --> 43:53.580
and the idea of restricting anything has never occurred to them?

43:55.320 --> 43:59.060
Of restricting the supply of anything. They don't need you to protect them from anybody.

43:59.880 --> 44:04.020
And none of the tricks or the psychology or the scare tactics work.

44:05.400 --> 44:12.000
So what happens when a race of machine-raised people eventually collides with a race with people-raised people?

44:12.860 --> 44:14.540
And that's really what the story is all about.

44:16.520 --> 44:20.140
Alright, let's hold for just a second. Crank the machine back up here.

44:22.300 --> 44:22.780
Okay.

44:25.400 --> 44:27.020
Shut the machine back up.

44:27.440 --> 44:32.060
Okay, I'll go ahead and ask the question and then we'll just splice this into this show when we do it.

44:34.120 --> 44:38.260
In your novel, Two Faces of Tomorrow, you explore the future of machine intelligence.

44:39.080 --> 44:42.480
How far away do you think we might be from intelligent computers?

44:46.980 --> 44:49.620
I don't know that I have an answer to that.

44:52.720 --> 44:57.680
Two Faces was not intended to be prophetic in any way.

44:57.680 --> 45:07.160
Nothing that I write in the fiction sense is I simply sketch possibilities of what might be, not predictions of what will be.

45:08.960 --> 45:13.820
Putting a time limit on it, it's an awkward thing to be asked to do.

45:16.900 --> 45:20.320
I'm sort of thinking about this.

45:20.420 --> 45:33.580
My mind is going back over the number of confident predictions that have been made in the past on various topics that proved disasterously wrong either one way or the other.

45:33.580 --> 45:48.820
But I see no reason in principle why artificial systems of some kind, not necessarily what we'd call computers.

45:49.020 --> 45:53.800
In other words, electronics of some form inside a box of some form.

45:53.800 --> 46:11.220
But simply man-made systems should not in principle be capable of all of the feats that are performed by the human mind.

46:11.220 --> 46:22.580
In other words, thinking in the sense that we normally use the word and all its connotations in everyday conversations.

46:27.200 --> 46:35.860
We have a system already in existence, a physical system that can think the human brain itself.

46:38.120 --> 46:55.580
We could turn the question around a little and say if the human brain is a physical system that can think, is there any reason to suppose that some other system shouldn't be capable of doing likewise?

46:55.800 --> 47:00.420
And I see my answer is absolutely no reason why not.

47:01.720 --> 47:04.900
I don't see anything unique that sets the human brain.

47:05.020 --> 47:07.080
The question really becomes metaphysical.

47:07.340 --> 47:22.720
I think the question what lurking behind or beneath the surface of this whole debate is do we feel that the human mind can be adequately accounted for by the familiar laws of physics and no more?

47:23.460 --> 47:32.940
Or does the phenomenon of mind require something extra, some life force, some mystical agency and so on, all of what you like?

47:34.560 --> 47:39.660
And depending how we answer that question I think that will shape our answer to the artificial intelligence issue.

47:40.440 --> 47:44.700
Personally, I feel that the human mind requires nothing extra to account for it.

47:45.660 --> 47:57.160
To that being so, there's no reason why an equally complex system that happened to have come from some other origin than natural evolution.

47:58.080 --> 48:04.820
In other words, having been conceived and built by human beings shouldn't be capable of the same thing.
