Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.520 --> 00:33.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.280
And here are your hosts.

00:42.860 --> 00:50.160
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Few individuals have had the impact on
science fiction that Damon Knight has. He's written quality short stories and

00:50.160 --> 00:57.940
novels, of course, since his first published work over 40 years ago in 1941. But
he's done so much else for the field. He's recognized as the first, and perhaps

00:57.940 --> 01:04.560
still the best, critic of science fiction. He founded the Science Fiction
Writers of America, and he initiated the Milford Science Fiction Writers

01:04.560 --> 01:12.160
Conference for authors of science fiction. He's also one of the premier editors
in science fiction, having constructed enough anthologies to fill a library. We

01:12.160 --> 01:18.120
spoke with Knight recently and asked him how he got his start in science
fiction. I thought that might come up, and I was rooting about it a little

01:18.120 --> 01:18.520
yesterday.

01:21.520 --> 01:31.440
Actually, I was thinking, what if you asked me to what do I attribute my
gigantic success? I would have to say mostly luck. I can trace my career back

01:31.440 --> 01:41.800
through a series of just astounding coincidences, really unlikely things, all
the way back to Hugo Gernsback. And I can demonstrate that at each of these

01:41.800 --> 01:49.840
points, if something rather unlikely had not happened, I wouldn't be doing what
I'm doing. For instance, if Hugo Gernsback had not come to this country from

01:49.840 --> 01:55.680
Luxembourg when he was 14 and started a magazine called Amazing Stories in 1926,

01:58.040 --> 02:05.280
you'll see as I go on that none of the other things could have happened. So here
I am, a 13-year-old kid in Hood River, Oregon, reading science fiction

02:05.280 --> 02:17.160
magazines, really turned on by them. And through the back pages of one of these
magazines, Super Science Stories, then edited by Frederick Bull, I found out

02:17.160 --> 02:26.660
about fanzines and wrote away for a few. And this boy got into correspondence
with the Futurians. The Futurians were a group of young science fiction fans who

02:26.660 --> 02:34.340
later became some of the major writers and editors in the field. At the time,
they included Frederick Pohl, Donald A. Walheim, Cyril Kornbluth, and Robert W.

02:34.520 --> 02:45.120
Lowndes. I was trying to write some stories, and I sent a couple to Lowndes, who
was then acting as a sort of half-assed literary agent. And all these things

02:45.120 --> 02:56.400
added up together until Donald A. Walheim got an offer from a publisher to edit
a new science fiction magazine. He had no budget whatever for stories. And he

02:56.400 --> 03:05.140
knew about me from Lowndes. Lowndes wrote to me saying, Will you donate this
story to the first issue of Super, a stirring science story? And of course I

03:05.140 --> 03:15.260
said yes. I would have paid for the privilege. And as a consequence of that, the
Futurians invited me to come and be a Futurian, and live in one of their

03:15.260 --> 03:25.720
communal dwellings in New York when I was 18. Terribly unlikely thing. Just a
series of them, even as far as it's gone. And I lived there a couple of years

03:25.720 --> 03:40.140
doing a little illustration for magazines and trying to write, not repeating
very much. And then in 1943, again, it was Fred Pohl, got me a job at Popular

03:40.140 --> 03:49.760
Publications where he was working. I needed an assistant editor. And he knew I
would work cheap. So he got me an interviewer. I got the job. Spent about a year

03:49.760 --> 03:58.940
there. And I'm perfectly convinced now, looking back, that it was that training
at Popular Publications that enabled me to write fiction professionally. It was

03:58.940 --> 04:06.800
a training that you couldn't get in any school then. I doubt if you could get it
now. But it just kind of soaked in because I was reading The Slush Pile, the

04:06.800 --> 04:14.080
unsolicited manuscripts, and it became perfectly obvious after a while what the
difference was between the stuff we were rejecting and the stuff we were

04:14.080 --> 04:17.560
printing. So when I quit that job, I started writing.

04:26.760 --> 04:34.140
Knight began publishing science fiction stories, many of which have become
classics today. But he also continued his editing and considers such work as the

04:34.140 --> 04:43.660
ideal training ground for young science fiction writers. If I could recommend a
writing course, a training course for young writers, I would certainly say it's

04:43.660 --> 04:52.500
too bad that those pulp magazines don't exist anymore. If you could possibly get
an editorial job or anything of that kind, even a terrible job in the Reading

04:52.500 --> 04:56.580
Sea Literary Agency to grab it. More with Damon Knight next time.

Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:17.600 --> 06:22.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.120
And here are your hosts.

06:31.140 --> 06:39.080
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Damon Knight's apprenticeship to science
fiction came as a member of the Futurians, a group of fans in the 1930s who

06:39.080 --> 06:47.000
later became some of the principal editors and writers in the field. Knight has
written a book about the Futurians, published in 1977. He reminisces about the

06:47.000 --> 06:59.760
group. Well, the Futurians were a very informal organization of science fiction
fans who were trying to become professionals. And in some cases had had little

06:59.760 --> 07:09.420
bits of success here and there in published stories. And I told you that Walheim
was editing a magazine. Before him, Pohl had become an editor. And after him,

07:09.580 --> 07:19.060
Lowndes also became an editor. And they were writing and publishing a little
bit, not much. And to save money, because they were all very poor, they lived in

07:19.060 --> 07:30.940
a communal apartment. At that time in New York, in the late 30s and early 40s,
there were lots of apartments that were very cheap. I forget now. I think the

07:30.940 --> 07:41.400
rental might have been about 30 bucks for a four-bedroom railroad flat. If you
had four people living there, it was quite cheap. And we divided up the

07:41.400 --> 07:52.280
household booties. Well, we did the cooking and I did the dish washing, which I
hated. We were dirt poor. We really didn't have any money at all. We rolled our

07:52.280 --> 07:59.160
own cigarettes and we bought the cheapest wine we could find, which was
something like 85 cents a gallon.

08:02.480 --> 08:12.100
Our major entertainment was walking down from 102nd Street or 103rd, if I was
down, to Times Square. And looking at the bright lights and having a cup of

08:12.100 --> 08:14.460
coffee in the cafeteria and walking home.

08:36.960 --> 08:44.780
Before Knight became recognized as an author of science fiction, he worked on
fanzines, as an editor, and as a book reviewer. Out of his experiences as a book

08:44.780 --> 08:51.280
reviewer, Knight developed some critical principles that he applied to science
fiction. And he actually became the first, and probably still the best, critic

08:51.280 --> 09:00.140
of the field. Knight talks about that period of his development in the 1940s
when he began writing criticism. I was trying to write fiction at that time and

09:00.140 --> 09:09.260
not succeeding. I couldn't finish stories. I didn't have any idea of how you got
to the end of the story. But I was extremely critical and starting, like any

09:09.260 --> 09:12.640
other bright 17 or 18-year-old fan.

09:15.580 --> 09:26.000
The first stuff I did for fanzines was not critical in the usual sense. I mean,
it wasn't book reviews or that kind of thing. But it was parody, mostly. The

09:26.000 --> 09:39.160
things that I thought were really outstandingly dumb in the magazine, funny
enough to parody. And I did a lot of that. But when I say a lot, I lie because I

09:39.160 --> 09:49.740
only published two issues of my fanzines and did very little for other
magazines. And it was much later, about 1945, I think, that I did a long

09:49.740 --> 10:01.040
critical essay about Van Gogh for one of Larry Shaw's amateur magazines. And
that was really the first critical work in the usual sense that I did. Knight's

10:01.040 --> 10:08.360
criticism and book reviews were published in 1967 as a book entitled In Search
of Wonder, a landmark since it was the first book of its kind. What Knight

10:08.360 --> 10:14.560
basically tried to do in his criticism was raise science fiction writing to a
higher level, to establish standards for it that would make it the equal of

10:14.560 --> 10:22.940
mainstream literature and quality. Well, that was my position then. I didn't see
any reason why science fiction shouldn't be as good as any other kind of fiction

10:22.940 --> 10:26.380
can be. I don't think now that it ever has been.

10:29.500 --> 10:41.020
And I still have a few doubts now about whether it can be. But at that time, as
you say, my effort was to try to raise the standards, improve the breed, mainly

10:41.020 --> 10:46.420
by shooting purples. On our next show, we'll continue our conversation with
Damon Knight.

10:53.800 --> 11:01.620
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

11:01.620 --> 11:02.360
Odessa, Texas.

11:24.260 --> 11:25.720
Withodore Macchiã,

11:42.660 --> 11:42.660
Texas.

11:47.440 --> 11:51.480
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:07.220 --> 12:12.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.860
And here are your hosts.

12:21.040 --> 12:29.060
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Damon Knight's influence on science fiction
is indisputable, and it's made itself felt in many different ways. Knight was

12:29.060 --> 12:38.100
the originator of the Science Fiction Writers of America, for example, back in
1965. We asked him how the organization came about. About ten years earlier it

12:38.100 --> 12:47.380
must have been, and there was an effort to form a guild of science fiction
writers. And I went to one or two of their meetings, and it was pitiful because

12:47.380 --> 12:59.420
they used the parliamentary procedure, and they had 50 people all arguing. And
they finally hammered out a set of bylaws and elected officers, and then nothing

12:59.420 --> 13:08.060
happened. The officers all went home and just died. And I realized at that time
that there was a very easy way to do it. You didn't have to have the big

13:08.060 --> 13:16.620
meetings, and you didn't have to have all that apparatus. One person could do
it. But I didn't think I was conspicuous enough at that time. I didn't think

13:16.620 --> 13:34.400
anybody knew who I was. Later on, I was becoming more visible, and I realized
that I probably could do it. The precipitating event was by receiving in the

13:34.400 --> 13:47.780
same week three requests for anthology reprints for flat Cs, which I thought was
unfair to the author. So I wrote a flyer, the one-page thing, advising authors

13:47.780 --> 13:56.220
not to sign agreements for flat C anthology reprints, and saying, if you'd like
more information of this kind, send in your three bucks and become a charter

13:56.220 --> 14:06.640
member of SFWA. A flock of responses. And when I had about 78, I declared them
the charter members and wrote a set of bylaws and sent that around, and we were

14:06.640 --> 14:13.880
more or less in business. The Science Fiction Writers of America has helped
authors in various ways. For example, by helping them get better contracts from

14:13.880 --> 14:20.980
publishers, by fighting legal battles, and providing encouragement and
professional recognition. Another thing Knight was responsible for was to act as

14:20.980 --> 14:28.380
the co-founder of the Milford Science Fiction Writers Conference in 1956. The
Milford Conference was conceived by Knight and Judith Merrill as an aide to

14:28.380 --> 14:35.400
science fiction writers. It provided them with an opportunity to have their work
read and criticized by other professional science fiction writers. Knight talks

14:35.400 --> 14:45.040
about how the Milford Conference began. Well, this was in the mid-50s. And for
some reason, Judy Merrill and I got to talking about the idea of having a

14:45.040 --> 14:54.380
writer's conference in Milford, Pennsylvania, which is a very small town in the
Poconos. It was sort of the way you might talk about building a boat in your

14:54.380 --> 15:06.580
basement. And nothing was done about this until Judy and I went to the Worldcon
in Detroit, I think it was, and discovered that we were much more better than we

15:06.580 --> 15:17.100
realized. So that energized us, and we thought that possibly if we invited
people to Milford, they could actually come. And we sent out invitations. We got

15:17.100 --> 15:29.820
Jim Bush to join the masthead, lend it more respectability. And this was the
year in which the Worldcon, the following year, Worldcon was in New York. So it

15:29.820 --> 15:43.040
was easier for people to get out there directly afterwards. And we got 40
people. Just amazing. It was quite intense. We had evening discussions that went

15:43.040 --> 15:50.280
on for several hours. People raising the forest of hands to do the next to
speak. Quite exciting.

16:01.460 --> 16:08.020
A regular feature of the conference was the workshop, in which authors would
submit manuscripts and have them criticized by other members of the conference.

16:08.280 --> 16:15.720
Damon Knight and his wife, Kate Wilhelm, now conduct the Clarion Workshop in
science fiction and fantasy. The Clarion Workshop is based on the same idea as

16:15.720 --> 16:22.500
the Milford Workshop, though attending writers are beginners for the most part,
and Knight and Wilhelm are the teachers. Professional writers of science fiction

16:22.500 --> 16:28.860
and beginning writers, too, who have hopes of becoming established
professionals, have a great deal to thank Damon Knight for. We'll talk with

16:28.860 --> 16:30.760
Damon Knight about one of his novels on our next show.

16:37.740 --> 16:45.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:45.640 --> 16:46.400
Odessa, Texas.

17:04.520 --> 17:10.440
The Science Fiction Radio Show,

17:40.500 --> 17:44.480
coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:00.180 --> 18:05.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.880
And here are your hosts.

18:14.180 --> 18:23.300
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. Damon Knight's best science fiction has a
real cutting edge to it, some sort of satire, irony, or social criticism. A good

18:23.300 --> 18:31.020
example is a second novel published in 1959 as The People Maker, but reissued
under Knight's preferred title, A for Anything. The story focuses on the

18:31.020 --> 18:38.740
question of how society would change if a matter duplicator were suddenly given
to mankind. The duplicator, called the gizmo, can copy anything, a tool, a

18:38.740 --> 18:46.480
building, a weapon, a vehicle, even a human being. Optimists may think society
would be enormously benefited from such a device, but that's not the way it

18:46.480 --> 18:53.780
turns out in Knight's novel. Quite the reverse. The social structure becomes
futile, with a few rich and powerful families controlling everything through the

18:53.780 --> 19:01.460
power of the gizmo. And slavery is a fact of life, too. The majority of the
people are poor and exploited by the powerful. For most of the novel, it seems

19:01.460 --> 19:09.000
the protagonist, the son of a rich and powerful gizmo owner, will aid in a slave
revolt which will overthrow the oppressive society. But on the final page of the

19:09.000 --> 19:16.180
novel, he shoots the wise old slave who has been leading the revolt, and chooses
to remain a rich tyrant. It's got to be one of the most depressing endings a

19:16.180 --> 19:24.940
science fiction novel ever had. We asked Knight why he produced it. Well, what
you're talking about, the ending that you expected, is the cliché ending.

19:26.080 --> 19:35.740
Romantic and sentimental. So I wanted to do a realistic ending. I thought that
the happy ending to that, you know, a conventional, quote, happy ending to that

19:35.740 --> 19:43.700
novel would have been false. And this was one of the things that interested me
in writing the novel in the first place. You know, anything I've done, in fact,

19:43.700 --> 19:55.160
except for the lapsing. I was trying to do science fiction realistically. I
thought that was part of the new wave. It wasn't called that then, but the wave

19:55.160 --> 20:05.420
of realism that came in the 50s. And I was awfully excited, still am, of the
romantic clichés of science fiction. We asked Knight why such a marvelous device

20:05.420 --> 20:17.160
as the gizmo would result in a tyrannical, slave-oriented society. Well, I
thought it was logical. I was counterpunching in that novel against some other

20:17.160 --> 20:29.080
treatments of the same device, the same gadgets that had been published before,
which I thought were cop-outs. For instance, George Oaks Smith wrote one in

20:29.080 --> 20:37.600
which the matter-type duplicator was invented. And, of course, chaos ensued, and
he rescued the world by inventing a kind of currency that couldn't be

20:37.600 --> 20:48.740
duplicated. And that was one too many rabbits out of the hat, I thought. So,
again, I just wanted to do it realistically. It seemed to me that if I had made

20:48.740 --> 21:04.800
a good case, that, in fact, slavery would be the result, I admit that it was an
imaginative projection. I don't necessarily defend the idea that that's what

21:04.800 --> 21:15.080
would happen in practice. And another writer, several years later, wrote a story
in response to that one, which really delighted me. I liked its dialogue aspect

21:15.080 --> 21:27.400
of science fiction, in which he showed that a good marketer, a good businessman,
could get along perfectly well and make money, even if there was a matter

21:27.400 --> 21:36.560
-duplicated. Marvelous story. We compared Knight's novel with Pole and
Kornblues' The Space Merchants, also published in the 1950s, and also a sharp

21:36.560 --> 21:47.060
criticism of society. We asked him if criticism of that sort was normal in
science fiction of the 50s. No, I think Fred Bowles and Kornblues' The Space

21:47.060 --> 22:01.560
Merchants, a gravy planet that was published in the magazine, was a stunning
rejection of the kind of thematic cliché that had been dominant in science

22:01.560 --> 22:12.160
fiction up until that time. And there had been social satire in science fiction
for a long time before during science fiction. And the magazine published some

22:12.160 --> 22:21.300
of it, but it was pretty remote. It didn't have the cutting edge that the gravy
planet had. More with Damon Knight next time.

22:28.320 --> 22:36.180
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:36.180 --> 22:51.660
Odessa, Texas. The Science

22:51.660 --> 22:58.320
Fiction Radio Show,

23:20.740 --> 23:24.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:40.420 --> 23:45.740
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.120
And here are your hosts.

23:54.400 --> 24:02.800
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. A clever, sharp wit characterizes the
science fiction of Damon Knight. His work is for the thinking reader, the type

24:02.800 --> 24:10.740
who appreciates irony, satire, unexpected twist and plot and ending. Much of his
fiction is characterized by a critical or negative tone. His stories, for

24:10.740 --> 24:18.260
example, seldom have happy endings. We asked him if he was a pessimistic person.
I'm not a pessimistic person in my daily life.

24:21.540 --> 24:32.160
I hate the word optimistic, but I'm cheerful most of the time. And I have a lot
of fun. I don't worry too much about disasters in the future. I certainly don't

24:32.160 --> 24:48.500
enjoy seeing people flip on banana peels. But I like irony and surprising people
in his stories. I dislike very much the story that says everything is going to

24:48.500 --> 24:56.740
be rosy and says it in a very implausible way and everybody laughs it up. I
don't know why. One of the stories in which Knight surprises his readers is

24:56.740 --> 25:05.100
entitled To Serve Man. It concerns a race of aliens who arrive on the Earth and
immediately put their superior technology to work to benefit the human race. One

25:05.100 --> 25:12.880
of the humans' chances on a book of the aliens. He works hard to translate it
and renders the title as To Serve Man. Everyone is pleased at the aliens' great

25:12.880 --> 25:20.240
generosity and kindness until they find out on the last page of the story that
the volume is a cookbook. Another witty effort is a story called The Country of

25:20.240 --> 25:29.020
the Kind. It takes place in a future world in which the entire human race is
kind, humane, and benevolent. Except for one single individual, a throwback, who

25:29.020 --> 25:36.000
is miserable because his violence and cruelty are tolerated by the general
society around him. The story almost makes you feel sorry for the cruel and

25:36.000 --> 25:43.660
destructive man, since his insane actions have absolutely no effect on the
blandness he's surrounded by. Knight's latest work, a novel entitled The World

25:43.660 --> 25:51.880
and Thorin, is one that he spent some 15 years on. It seems a departure from his
previous writing, and in fact the Berkeley paperback edition is labeled fantasy.

25:52.180 --> 26:03.900
But Knight disagrees with that designation. In the little introductory section
of the chapter, I thought I had laid out more or less what happened. But someone

26:03.900 --> 26:04.780
was about to go nova.

26:09.420 --> 26:23.880
People made a spaceship out of the Earth and propelled it out of the solar
system. And also went underground to accommodate the increasing population. Put

26:23.880 --> 26:35.160
the planet under the control of a central computer. And when there was a war
which destroyed civilization, the complete control was turned over to the

26:35.160 --> 26:51.880
computer, was directed to do whatever was necessary for the welfare of human
beings. And since the computer had not been told what welfare meant to human

26:51.880 --> 27:04.100
beings, it had to try to figure out what was the best society. And therefore,
having sealed up these caverns in order to prevent another war, it promoted the

27:04.100 --> 27:15.540
growth of different kinds of cultures, each one in each full cavern, hoping to
find out eventually what the best one was. Hope was passed. But that was the

27:15.540 --> 27:24.600
world in which the novel takes place. I really thought I had indicated that
sufficiently, but perhaps not. The world in Thorin is an episodic narrative. The

27:24.600 --> 27:32.200
protagonist, a lame young man named Thorin, journeys through caverns under the
Earth. And each cavern contains a separate race and a separate culture. And

27:32.200 --> 27:38.400
Thorin has an adventure of sorts with each one of them. Some of the episodes
seem like complete short stories, and we asked Knight if they were published

27:38.400 --> 27:48.060
separately. That's right. Fred Thorin ran, I think, three of them in Galaxy. And
you have to go pretty far back in the files to find them, because it did take me

27:48.060 --> 27:55.620
15 years to finish it. The world in Thorin doesn't have the bite or the satire
that characterizes much of Knight's work, but it's an enjoyable and exciting

27:55.620 --> 28:00.980
novel. And this is what readers have come to expect of Damon Knight, one of the
all-time masters of science fiction.
