00:09.360 --> 00:13.260
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.480
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.780
And here are your hosts.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.160
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.260
For 40 years a high school science teacher in Massachusetts has been writing first class

00:47.260 --> 00:51.340
science fiction, and in the early 1950s he published one of the classic novels in the

00:51.340 --> 00:51.640
field.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.960
That man is Harry C. Stubbs, better known as Hal Clement.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.400
Though he's produced relatively few novels, Clement has a high reputation among his peers

00:59.400 --> 00:59.800
and readers.

01:00.440 --> 01:04.600
He writes solid, highly crafted pieces of literature, all with a characteristic Clement

01:04.600 --> 01:07.220
trademark, scientific accuracy and realism.

01:07.620 --> 01:10.540
He has a reputation as one of the best of all hard science fiction writers.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.700
We asked him why he writes the way he does.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.820
I'm not sure I'm a good enough psychoanalyst to answer that.

01:18.280 --> 01:24.360
I just feel that I have trouble writing something unless I can more or less convince myself

01:24.360 --> 01:25.680
that it might happen.

01:26.460 --> 01:34.060
The best example, I guess, was my attempt a few years ago to write a story for an anthology

01:34.060 --> 01:35.760
of vampire tales.

01:36.260 --> 01:40.140
When I had finished it, I discovered that it was a science fiction story.

01:41.940 --> 01:48.180
I counted for everything that happened on a scientific basis, and I wasn't happy about

01:48.180 --> 01:50.460
it until I could account for them that way.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.240
Clement's first story, entitled Proof, was published by the great science fiction editor

01:55.240 --> 01:57.000
John W. Campbell in 1942.

01:57.880 --> 02:01.080
Clement says that Campbell helped him a great deal, especially since the two of them have

02:01.080 --> 02:02.820
similar ideas concerning science fiction.

02:04.220 --> 02:07.140
We're both materialists, I guess.

02:07.360 --> 02:13.000
We felt that the universe does run by rule, and we felt that a story was most believable

02:13.000 --> 02:20.380
when it matched those rules, at least as we, we, meaning humanity in general, currently

02:20.380 --> 02:21.120
understood them.

02:22.020 --> 02:26.240
Clement's best known work, a genuine science fiction classic, is Mission of Gravity, published

02:26.240 --> 02:28.680
serially by Campbell in the early 1950s.

02:28.820 --> 02:32.080
His most recent novel, which came out in 1981, is Nitrogen Fix.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.220
And his emphasis on hard science is obvious in the book.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.420
It's a convincingly realistic account of what the earth might be like if all the oxygen

02:39.420 --> 02:40.600
were removed from the atmosphere.

02:40.940 --> 02:43.240
The result, he thinks, might be an atmosphere of nitrogen.

02:44.340 --> 02:46.280
The idea itself does not know.

02:46.540 --> 02:53.300
It was used many years ago in a story called The Mightiest Machine by John Campbell, which

02:53.300 --> 02:59.140
someone invented a catalyst which permitted the direct combination of nitrogen and oxygen

02:59.140 --> 03:01.780
to nitrogen pentoxide.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.860
I was more careful quantitatively than John was.

03:05.860 --> 03:12.160
He had the snowflakes of nitrogen pentoxide drifting out of the sky and bursting into

03:12.160 --> 03:13.900
flame as they hit organic matter.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.040
It oxidized it.

03:15.280 --> 03:22.340
The red-brown gases that rose when the high oxides of nitrogen got reduced by other things

03:22.340 --> 03:29.040
like organics and the streams fuming as the oxides of nitrogen boiled into them.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.680
There's a very impressive book, beautiful adventure story.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.540
But unfortunately, there isn't that much oxygen in the earth as an atmosphere.

03:35.820 --> 03:39.460
You couldn't have made that much nitrogen pentoxide.

03:40.020 --> 03:44.320
And I had to tone everything down a good deal and have the worst of it have happened in

03:44.320 --> 03:49.340
the past and try to figure out what the final results would have been, or intermediate results

03:49.340 --> 03:52.020
anyway, a couple of thousand years after things had started.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.520
Clement explains how he got started writing science fiction 40 years ago.

03:57.160 --> 04:03.020
Rather gradually, I was reading the stuff originally and started, I think, with the Buck Rogers

04:03.020 --> 04:03.860
comic strip.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.720
And I discovered there were magazines.

04:07.140 --> 04:15.360
I began telling the stories that I'd read in magazines to friends on the grade school

04:15.360 --> 04:18.360
playground and to boy scouts at campfires.

04:19.020 --> 04:24.980
Then I began correcting some of the errors that I spotted in the stories and eventually

04:24.980 --> 04:26.740
began trying to write my own.

04:27.380 --> 04:30.420
He's been writing his own very successfully for a long while now.

04:30.820 --> 04:34.020
Yet his total output is not great because he can't devote all his time to it.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.600
It's been a hobby all along.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.840
And in the last few years, there somehow seems to have been less and less time.

04:42.100 --> 04:45.940
I've been doing more work connected with my profession of high school science teaching.

04:46.660 --> 04:50.620
I'm currently president-elect of the New England Association of Chemistry Teachers.

04:50.860 --> 04:54.300
I have an awful feeling that's going to take a lot of my time for the next two and a half

04:54.300 --> 04:54.560
years.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.440
Join us next time for more about Hal Clement.

05:04.940 --> 05:09.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:09.040 --> 05:13.240
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.280
Coming up next...

05:54.280 --> 05:57.320
Next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:13.020 --> 06:17.940
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.200
And here are your hosts.

06:24.660 --> 06:26.180
This is David Carson...

06:26.180 --> 06:26.840
and Daryl Lane.

06:27.180 --> 06:31.140
Nothing is more typical of popular science fiction than alien creatures, and no one is

06:31.140 --> 06:33.740
more adept at inventing aliens than author Hal Clement.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.080
If there were such a thing as an authority on aliens, Clement would certainly qualify.

06:38.820 --> 06:41.940
Besides the weird creatures that turn up in his own work, he's written a fascinating

06:41.940 --> 06:44.940
essay in the subject entitled The Creation of Imaginary Beings.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.140
How does he go about developing the psychology of an alien creature?

06:48.820 --> 06:58.220
I am not sure, first of all, that an intelligent being's psychology would be all that different

06:58.220 --> 06:59.520
from the human one anyway.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.960
It is going to depend on the being's motivation.

07:02.660 --> 07:06.580
Presumably, the creature will be driven so as to survive.

07:07.300 --> 07:14.160
He or she or it, or they, if they have several sexes, are going to have drives to find food,

07:14.160 --> 07:15.380
to avoid pain.

07:16.100 --> 07:24.180
If they do have sexes, they will have drives to use them, exercise them, and all of those

07:24.180 --> 07:30.660
will tend to provide motivation recognizably similar to those of humanity.

07:31.540 --> 07:34.800
Clement is a science teacher and a writer of very realistic science fiction.

07:35.280 --> 07:40.060
Yes, and as you might expect, his aliens, as strange as they may be, are logically constructed

07:40.060 --> 07:41.580
from sound scientific principles.

07:42.280 --> 07:46.360
His mesclinite aliens, for instance, from the novel Mission of Gravity, live on a world

07:46.360 --> 07:47.660
of extremely heavy gravity.

07:48.260 --> 07:52.880
As a result, they are loaded to the ground and solidly built with many legs, similar to caterpillars.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.300
Right, he always attempts to construct his aliens from the particular environment they exist in.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.180
In other words, their world determines what they'll be like.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.640
We asked Clement what he thought of aliens in science fiction movies.

08:04.140 --> 08:05.080
How realistic are they?

08:06.000 --> 08:11.580
I haven't seen by any means all of the movie science fiction things.

08:12.080 --> 08:22.180
The one that was called Alien, I gather, was very impressive, but was so mostly by avoiding

08:22.180 --> 08:29.600
detailed portrayal of his or its or her nature, which of course is a perfectly good trick.

08:30.600 --> 08:41.540
I can't think of any alien I have seen in a movie who was really believable in character, believably alien.

08:42.120 --> 08:53.580
There were several unnamed species in the bar scene in the first of the shows, the Star Wars,

08:54.840 --> 09:04.420
where the scous was good, the arguing back and forth in a completely unintelligible language

09:04.420 --> 09:08.460
produced a very impressive and funny scene.

09:08.820 --> 09:13.120
But again, you can't really tell what the personalities of the creatures were like.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.960
They were very much like drunks in a terrestrial bar.

09:17.340 --> 09:20.420
I think a good job was done, but I wouldn't say they were really alien.

09:27.940 --> 09:32.140
In response to those who say his own aliens are convincingly realistic in their psychology,

09:32.780 --> 09:34.780
Clement reveals the secret of how he constructs them.

09:35.440 --> 09:43.340
For those people who say that my aliens are noticeably alien, not human in psychology,

09:43.340 --> 09:45.880
I'm afraid I have a rather cynical answer.

09:46.480 --> 09:53.740
My secret for making a being seen non-human is to make him act rationally.

09:54.660 --> 09:58.120
For example, I can be fairly specific about this one.

09:58.560 --> 10:07.240
In the sequel to Mission of Gravity, Starlight, at one point I had one of my masternites driving one of these giant tanks

10:07.240 --> 10:12.660
along a completely unknown territory, and nothing was happening.

10:13.260 --> 10:20.960
He wanted to get somewhere, and he gradually began going a little faster and a little faster as a human being would do.

10:21.860 --> 10:28.100
Then he suddenly realized what he was doing and slowed down again, which is of course the rational thing to do.

10:28.540 --> 10:33.600
My own suspicion is that nine human beings out of ten would not have slowed down until they'd run into something.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.900
We'll have more on Hell, Clement, tomorrow.

10:43.360 --> 10:48.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:48.780 --> 10:51.940
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:39.820 --> 11:43.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.520
And here are your hosts.

12:12.580 --> 12:13.820
This is Daryl Ames.

12:14.860 --> 12:21.000
The April 1953 issue of Astounding Science Fiction contained the beginning of a serial which was to become a Science Fiction Classic.

12:27.260 --> 12:33.660
The story is standard fare for Science Fiction, space exploration by Earthmen which results in contact with an alien culture.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.840
What sets the novel apart from others of its type though is its hard science background.

12:45.840 --> 12:51.940
The planet is called Mesclun, one of the most famous worlds in science fiction. We asked Clement how he developed it.

13:14.100 --> 13:24.440
So I went to work. I am, as I say, a rather firm materialist. I have serious doubts and things like gravity screens, anti-gravity machines.

13:25.180 --> 13:29.860
The only thing I could think of which would produce such a variation was rapid spin.

13:30.560 --> 13:35.280
And this was before you could steal time on computers because they hadn't been invented.

13:35.420 --> 13:43.140
I had a good deal of slide rule work and also some consultation with such astronomy texts as I could get hold of.

13:43.140 --> 13:48.020
And I came up with what seemed to be a valid planet at the time.

13:49.140 --> 13:57.660
Mesclun spins so rapidly that it's flattened to a disc shape and the gravity varies from three times that of Earth at the equator to 650 times at the poles.

13:58.320 --> 14:04.340
Men from Earth have sent an exploratory probe to Mesclun's surface but they can't get it back because of the incredibly heavy gravity.

14:04.620 --> 14:09.260
So they enlist the help of some native Mesclunites who resemble 15 inch long caterpillars.

14:09.260 --> 14:15.780
The story itself is a fascinating one but equally fascinating as the scientific detail Clement provides a setting for the narrative.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.640
The gravity is so heavy, for example, that a fall of a few inches would crush your mesculinite.

14:21.040 --> 14:26.460
The mesculinites are so used to staying close to the ground that to see one of them climbing anything would drive the others mad.

14:33.880 --> 14:38.720
Clement has written of something he calls the game by which he means a contest between writer and reader.

14:39.020 --> 14:44.040
In the game a reader of a science fiction story tries to find statements or ideas which conflict with current science.

14:44.620 --> 14:47.780
The writer, on the other hand, tries to make as few slips as he possibly can.

14:48.420 --> 14:52.180
Clement says that a group of very intelligent readers played the game with mission of gravity.

14:53.740 --> 15:01.180
Somebody was playing the game. I believe it was a group of members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Science Fiction Society.

15:01.600 --> 15:07.120
It's just for short. And they began taking Mesclun apart mathematically.

15:07.760 --> 15:15.160
I understand from some of them the planet actually should come to a sharp edge at the equator instead of a smooth curve.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.580
But I am not a good enough mathematician myself to check up on this point.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.700
Clement wrote a sequel to Mission of Gravity which came out in 1970.

15:30.540 --> 15:34.860
It's called Starlight and it continues this strange relationship between mesculinites and humans.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.520
He explains why he did the sequel.

15:37.120 --> 15:43.620
In a sense I was talked into it. I'm very uneasy about sequels and series stories in general.

15:43.800 --> 15:48.360
My experience has been with reading them but I was always disappointed by the later ones.

15:48.360 --> 15:55.820
I formed my opinion of what things were like and the later stories usually changed those opinions and disappointed me.

15:56.400 --> 16:00.200
The Mission of Gravity sequel came as a result of a conversation.

16:01.300 --> 16:10.800
I think at one of the New York conventions a fan said something and I can't now remember exactly what it was

16:10.800 --> 16:16.620
which sounded like a good idea to use the Mastronites and I built it up from there.

16:17.320 --> 16:20.760
Mission of Gravity is probably the best of all hard science fiction novels.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.980
Any serious reader of science fiction should be familiar with it.

16:31.340 --> 16:36.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:36.700 --> 16:39.900
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
