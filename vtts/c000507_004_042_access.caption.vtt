coming up next is the science fiction radio show so stay with us

00:28.580 --> 00:33.940
this is the science fiction radio show a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy

00:36.620 --> 00:38.360
and here are your hosts

00:42.180 --> 00:50.440
this is daryl lane and david carson in 1979 two remarkable science fiction
novels that seemed to share a number of amazing coincidences were published one

00:50.440 --> 00:57.900
of the novels was the fountains of paradise the hugo award winner for that year
its author was british writer arthur c clark the other was web between the

00:57.900 --> 01:05.840
worlds its author was charles sheffield also british besides the fact that both
authors were british both novels treated an identical theme satellites in

01:05.840 --> 01:12.980
geosynchronous earth orbit or space elevators neither author knew that someone
else is working with the same idea but sheffield doesn't believe it's that

01:12.980 --> 01:22.760
startling a coincidence it's not really very surprising because the idea has
been around a long time the idea was proposed back in 1960 and i read of it in

01:22.760 --> 01:34.440
1960 in 1966 i read of it which was the first time it was published in the west
a russian called art sutanov published it in 1960 but he published it in russian

01:34.440 --> 01:43.980
in a publication that no one ever saw or heard of but i remember the 1966
publication in science magazine and thinking that's a neat idea and putting it

01:43.980 --> 01:55.640
off in the back of my head and uh presumably several others had noticed it and
thought of it at the same time and it's coincidence that clark and i should

01:55.640 --> 02:06.760
write the books so close together but in a sense uh if the books hadn't been
written so close together they would not both have been written because when

02:06.760 --> 02:16.800
somebody has written a book on a subject like that there's a tendency for other
people not to write uh with that same technological development sheffield says

02:16.800 --> 02:24.480
there was something coincidental about his discovery before publication of
either book that clark had done the same thing that he had the coincidence was

02:24.480 --> 02:33.840
that after as i had reached the point where i'd sent my manuscript off to ace
books and a friend of mine said that he heard that clark had written this book

02:33.840 --> 02:44.760
which was then available in galleys in which he had a space elevator and when i
read the book i i i sent clark my manuscript and he wrote back and said he was

02:44.760 --> 02:56.060
fascinated but he wasn't that surprised and when i read his book i realized what
he meant by that what he meant was that when you get right down to it the basic

02:56.060 --> 03:08.680
physics dictates what the uh structure must be like and it's very natural to
have your hero previously making a bridge of a bridge builder because this is in

03:08.680 --> 03:19.480
a sense a bridge from the earth up to orbit uh we had both in fact chosen heroes
with very similar names that was a coincidence his hero was called morgan mine

03:19.480 --> 03:29.320
was called merlin and before they built the space elevator they had both been
the world's leading builder of bridges sheffield goes on to relate some of the

03:29.320 --> 03:39.880
less obvious similarities about the two novels but there were some other rather
strange coincidences that were not obvious from the from reading the books one

03:39.880 --> 03:54.720
of them was when i was thinking of my of my principal character i had as a model
for him a 19th century english engineer called brunel well it turned out that

03:54.720 --> 04:04.760
clark actually had brunel in his book and references to him and that's an odd
coincidence that is perhaps explained by the fact that the clark came from

04:04.760 --> 04:13.420
england and so did i and we were sensitive to the english engineering tradition
that's the only way i can explain that but there were a number of coincidences

04:13.420 --> 04:24.300
it's not too surprising that we should write books in which the beanstalk or
space elevator looks very similar but there are other things that that are a bit

04:24.300 --> 04:33.680
more surprising than that but as one of my as one of my characters it keeps on
saying in a different book uh the laws of probability don't just permit

04:33.680 --> 04:42.900
coincidences they absolutely require them and to me it's not that surprising
that clark and i should have written the same book at the same time not the same

04:42.900 --> 04:50.720
book if you follow me but books with with a similar theme science fiction
readers should feel fortunate coincidences or not that both of these remarkable

04:50.720 --> 04:51.700
novels were published

04:58.480 --> 05:06.300
this has been the science fiction radio show a production of the permian basin

you

06:25.900 --> 06:27.480
and here are your hosts

06:31.580 --> 06:39.740
this is david carson and daryl lane charles sheffield belongs to that small
subgroup of science fiction authors who are practicing scientists hal clement

06:39.740 --> 06:47.020
robert forward fred hoyle and soon carl sagan will be some other authors in the
group sheffield who has a degree in theoretical physics and works for the earth

06:47.020 --> 06:54.860
satellite corporation in washington dc has published such popular novels as web
between the worlds site of proteus and my brother's keeper in addition to

06:54.860 --> 07:05.160
numerous short stories we asked him how he found time to be a scientist and a
science fiction author well i don't write as much as uh as what my wife would

07:05.160 --> 07:16.900
call real writers write uh full-time writers should be able to produce a lot
more than i do one reason i produce as much as i do produce is because i enjoy

07:16.900 --> 07:27.360
it i consider it a form of pleasure and relaxation and so i do it for choice
when i'm not doing other things but i feel that that if i didn't have a job i

07:27.360 --> 07:37.600
might write a lot more but i would probably enjoy it a lot less and in terms of
somebody who is prolific i don't produce much at all if you look at the

07:37.600 --> 07:49.660
productivity of well now i have to think of somebody who's prolific i suppose
andy offutt has written a couple of hundred books probably uh cj cherry produces

07:49.660 --> 08:01.360
i think probably three books a year jack chalker produces probably five books a
year silverberg when he was writing full time produced lord knows how many words

08:01.360 --> 08:12.040
a year one and a half million two million something like this uh in terms of
productive people i have a minute output when we remarked that many readers

08:12.040 --> 08:19.180
liked his fiction so well they'd wish he'd take up writing full time and produce
more of it he had an interesting response i appreciate the compliment but i

08:19.180 --> 08:32.060
suspect that that if i had more time i wouldn't write that much more i would
find other ways of of doing things i probably if i had half a day to write uh in

08:32.060 --> 08:43.020
other words if i worked half time at my job instead of full time i would produce
more but i might saturate because it would cease to be enjoyable after doing it

08:43.020 --> 08:54.260
for a certain period each day the definition that people use of a real writer is
somebody who has to write who will starve if they can't write and will write

08:54.260 --> 09:03.140
even if they have to starve i don't know if that makes sense by those terms i
don't consider i'm a real writer at all because although i like to write it's

09:03.140 --> 09:14.840
not the top of my priority of things i want to do and the scientific work
occupies a higher slot uh marion zimmer bradley said that when when she had to

09:14.840 --> 09:25.360
choose between uh a marriage and her writing or anything else in her writing her
writing wins that it's the most important thing in her life i just don't have

09:25.360 --> 09:37.340
that much uh attachment to it and i think the fact that i didn't write for so
long that i started uh for no particular reason after not writing for a long

09:37.340 --> 09:47.840
time may maybe uh one of the reasons i don't consider i'm a a true writer i
never felt the urge to write when i was young i never felt that fiction was

09:47.840 --> 10:01.460
something i had to do but many writers have that and it dominates their lives
finally we asked sheffield if he had fun writing i think i do i i certainly love

10:01.460 --> 10:12.280
to sit down and write i i often don't have time to do it but that's a different
consideration i find that that the several things that help me one is that i

10:12.280 --> 10:25.360
don't have to do it that uh that i'm doing it as a hobby another is that i write
lots of non-fiction and when i write non-fiction i'm constrained in what i can

10:25.360 --> 10:34.980
think in other words if you're writing respectable science you somewhat have to
put yourself into a into an acceptable framework and if you think outrageous

10:34.980 --> 10:44.120
thoughts you can't really write them down or you have to limit yourself whereas
in fiction you can think the most outrageous thoughts imaginable and generally

10:44.120 --> 10:55.840
speaking the more outrageous they are the more people like them so i do enjoy
writing this

11:50.260 --> 11:54.180
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:09.840 --> 12:15.200
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.580
And here are your hosts.

12:23.740 --> 12:31.700
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. Marion Zimmer Bradley's latest novel is a
fantasy epic that deals with the legends of King Arthur. It's entitled The Mists

12:31.700 --> 12:38.940
of Avalon, and it's recently been published in a hardcover edition by Alfred A.
Knopf. There are numerous retellings of the Arthurian material, some scholarly,

12:39.200 --> 12:46.680
some pure fantasy, but The Mists of Avalon is different. In the first place,
it's built around a strong thesis, that the rise of Arthur as a Christian king

12:46.680 --> 12:54.780
in a male-dominated society, coincided with the passing away of the old pagan
religion of the Celtic Druids, which was female-oriented. And secondly, Bradley

12:54.780 --> 13:03.220
concentrates her narrative on the women of the Arthurian legends. These would
include Guinevere, Arthur's wife and queen, Ygrine, his mother, Viviane, the

13:03.220 --> 13:11.160
lady of the lake and high priestess of Avalon, and Morgaine, or Morgan Le Fay,
sorceress and wizard lady. Bradley tells us how she came to write the book.

13:12.140 --> 13:21.040
Well, all my life I've been fascinated by King Arthur, but even more, I've been
fascinated by Morgan Le Fay. Mallory didn't approve of her, and she's been

13:21.040 --> 13:31.480
treated as a sort of evil sorceress, you know, quote-unquote. And you can hear
the capital letters all the way from Texas, I'm sure. So I started wondering who

13:31.480 --> 13:39.560
Morgan Le Fay and the lady of the lake really were. And there were a lot of
books on the search for the historical Arthur, but I started out on the search

13:39.560 --> 13:50.980
for the historical Morgan Le Fay. How did she get into the legends? And it led
me into the byways of pagan religions, into Druidism, into, I don't mean the

13:50.980 --> 14:06.200
modern thing, but what Caesar wrote about, and enormous amounts of ancient, you
might say ancient culture. So I finally came up with the realization that the

14:06.200 --> 14:19.520
whole Arthurian cycle is based upon the shift from Druidical and Celtic
religions to Christianity. And in the Celtic culture and the Celtic mythology

14:19.520 --> 14:29.180
and the Celtic religion, women were preeminent, whereas in Christianity, St.
Jerome and St. Augustine tried to convince every woman that she should be

14:29.180 --> 14:38.240
constantly doing penance and covered with shame for the very fact that she was a
woman. And that ghastly culture shock, I think, pervaded the whole Arthurian

14:38.240 --> 14:47.360
mythos. Mallory didn't get hold of it until later. The novel is remarkable for
its wealth of detail and its attention to character, both strong points in all

14:47.360 --> 14:54.520
of Marion Zimmer Bradley's work. All of the characters from the Arthurian
legends come alive in the novel, people like Merlin, Gwaine, and Galahad.

14:54.980 --> 15:02.660
Lancelot is in the novel, of course, and his love of Guinevere is sensitively
handled by Bradley. Bradley talks about the ideas beneath the novel. I took one

15:02.660 --> 15:15.820
element of fantasy, the idea that as our beliefs in the world change, our world
changes with it. The idea that people used to act and believe as if the world

15:15.820 --> 15:22.760
were the center of the universe, and now we know that the sun is at the center
of our galaxy, but that we're way out on the edge of it, and that changes our

15:22.760 --> 15:34.360
relationship to ourselves and our world. When people believed that the source of
life was just the mother, that was one belief system which very firmly and

15:34.360 --> 15:45.820
deeply pervaded their consciousnesses. And then when the idea came that the
mother was incidental, that man was created in God's image and women was just a

15:45.820 --> 15:58.600
poor imitation, it must have been a monster culture shock. And so I gave the
idea that the world actually changed at that time, that the religion, the idea

15:58.600 --> 16:09.460
of only having one God instead of a pantheon of God, changed people's minds. So
I took one fantasy element, the idea that as these old worlds, as people's ideas

16:09.460 --> 16:19.960
changed, the world changed too. So the world where the elves lived sort of went
into another dimension, being replaced by a world of pagan religion. And then

16:19.960 --> 16:28.960
when the world changed again, the world of pagan religion, what I call the world
of Avalon, went into the mists. Anyone who likes fantasy, or anyone who enjoys

16:28.960 --> 16:36.080
reading about King Arthur, will be fascinated with the mists of Avalon. And the
fascination should last for a long while too. In its hardcover format, the novel

16:36.080 --> 16:38.780
is over 800 pages. The word epic describes it well.
