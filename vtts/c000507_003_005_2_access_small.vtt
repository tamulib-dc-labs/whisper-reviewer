WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:06.020
Okay, the tapes are rolling and I believe I see the needles moving.

00:06.280 --> 00:15.040
Okay, since the Siege of Wonder came out, we haven't seen anything, any novels or short

00:15.040 --> 00:15.640
stories either.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.400
We talked about this while ago, but this is for the tape.

00:20.660 --> 00:26.240
Do you plan to do any more writing or have you outgrown that?

00:26.320 --> 00:26.800
Is that gone?

00:27.340 --> 00:34.260
Oh no, gosh, it's like being a Catholic.

00:34.740 --> 00:38.000
You're not, no one has ever, never a Catholic again.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.380
You just don't happen to be doing it at any one time.

00:41.480 --> 00:49.700
I certainly desperately hope to keep writing and put something together, which will be

00:49.700 --> 00:50.540
a good piece of work.

00:51.500 --> 00:58.840
Right now, as I said, the time, I hope I'm becoming also a better lawyer, a more able

00:58.840 --> 01:03.980
attorney, and that means I can do more and I am expected to do more and I want to.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.320
Also, we now have three children instead of two.

01:09.480 --> 01:16.480
That all presents a lot of breaks in the day and a reduction of available time.

01:16.480 --> 01:24.560
It's rather difficult to be turning over a consistent plot line in your mind when somebody

01:24.560 --> 01:28.420
insists just because they're paying you much, much money an hour to think about their problem.

01:29.060 --> 01:33.820
It's kind of difficult to maintain the threat of your character's problems in your mind,

01:33.860 --> 01:37.600
so when you're ready to sit down, you at least have, if you don't know what's going to happen

01:37.600 --> 01:43.580
next, at least you remember what just happened by the same token, organization of children,

01:45.940 --> 01:52.260
things like that, charming little people like that make it kind of difficult to write some

01:52.260 --> 01:55.260
bitter and black stuff that I've done before.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.300
So, time has changed, people have changed, and the environment has changed, and I certainly

02:03.300 --> 02:07.380
have every intention of sticking at it until it comes together again.

02:07.720 --> 02:12.220
I can't really conceive of any time when I just pack up the typewriter forever and say,

02:12.220 --> 02:15.160
that's it for me, there's no more point in all this.

02:17.040 --> 02:21.280
I've never allowed that, I think to come back to something I already mentioned, I've never allowed

02:21.280 --> 02:27.020
the writing, although it has probably been the most important part of my life for a great

02:27.020 --> 02:37.560
many years, in one sense or another, it has never dominated to the extent that I really

02:37.560 --> 02:43.220
had to do a good job, or to the extent that failure in any kind of time frame was to be

02:43.220 --> 02:44.180
a personal disaster.

02:45.320 --> 02:51.440
I remember the biographies of the great writers of the 1930s, and the commitment to those

02:51.440 --> 02:56.580
stuff, and indeed the commitment to great many writers who do what I'd say do it for real,

02:57.500 --> 03:03.240
and boy, even great ones very often come to a pretty sad end.

03:05.220 --> 03:10.340
It's a hard regiment, I'm sure everybody realizes it.

03:14.880 --> 03:19.060
It's a little daunting even now, maybe even especially now.

03:23.620 --> 03:33.180
You mentioned your lawyer and that, oh, okay, I go to science fiction conventions, and there

03:33.180 --> 03:38.760
are not a lot of lawyers there, in fact, there are very few, it just doesn't seem that people

03:38.760 --> 03:40.900
who are into that are into science fiction.

03:41.580 --> 03:48.440
How did your bosses, your peers, the people that you work with at your law firm, how did

03:48.440 --> 03:52.560
they take your, when you published The Siege of Wunder, then knowing what you'd done, how

03:52.560 --> 03:53.340
did they view that?

03:53.460 --> 03:53.820
I'm curious.

03:54.340 --> 03:57.900
Well, they viewed it with a great deal of favor because I bought the drinks for that time.

04:00.240 --> 04:09.640
The law firm I'm with right now has a very good mix of personality and achievements on

04:09.640 --> 04:15.260
field or another, and it happens to be mine, and it's regarded certainly without the least

04:15.260 --> 04:23.740
of the law, but I think what I have to be a little, you know, the firm itself attracts

04:24.400 --> 04:27.800
people with different abilities, perspectives and personalities.

04:29.160 --> 04:35.220
The idea of the New York law firm or the organization where the large law firm, we only have about

04:35.220 --> 04:44.340
20 folks in ours, and as an organization, I think it still cultivates individuality, and

04:44.340 --> 04:45.740
it happens to be evidence of mine.

04:46.140 --> 04:50.520
So it's, gosh, I'm the guy that interviewed him read the books.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.920
They told me they enjoyed it.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.200
Like I said, I was buying.

04:56.060 --> 04:57.700
It fits in very well.

04:57.860 --> 05:03.480
It's not, and again, going back to what I just said, it does not dominate my life.

05:03.500 --> 05:11.140
I've not allowed it to, nor have I sought a situation where it could if I wasn't paying

05:11.140 --> 05:15.900
attention or where I would feel that that would be the thing to do.

05:16.680 --> 05:21.340
So I certainly would be very insulted if anybody called it a hobby or dabbling.

05:21.640 --> 05:28.480
I don't believe it's that, but what I'm in the law firm, I trust I'm regarded as a lawyer

05:29.140 --> 05:36.840
who has written some books rather than a writer who does his for living right now.

05:38.020 --> 05:46.640
Do you actively or just somewhat keep up with fantasy and science fiction in its current state now?

05:47.140 --> 05:48.040
Regrettably not.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.720
No, I'm a very slow reader.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.060
I just don't have enough time.

05:57.080 --> 06:05.940
My primary reading category has always been history, still is, but I'm just trying to read

06:05.940 --> 06:10.300
as much as I possibly can of whatever curiosity interests me rather.

06:11.280 --> 06:20.980
So I try to mix it in with a pretty fair cross-section of, I don't want to say popular science,

06:21.180 --> 06:27.100
but a comprehensible science, history, novels, magazines, that sort of thing.

06:27.380 --> 06:30.660
I still read as much as I can, but it's not a great deal.

06:31.180 --> 06:32.840
Not as much nearly as much as I'd like.

06:32.840 --> 06:45.040
And of course what's happening in science fiction, I've really been out of that as much as I was ever truly in it for quite some time.

06:45.320 --> 06:52.700
So as far as the latest, latest, Asia in plot or aspect, I really couldn't help you there.

06:53.360 --> 07:03.740
I just along with the science fiction writers association for a while went to a little minor convention here during an argument.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.200
That was about it, really. Not an argument, man.

07:14.160 --> 07:22.760
Have you ever considered, if you do, write science fiction again, maybe combining your legal mind with the future anyway,

07:22.940 --> 07:26.340
maybe not science fiction, but the future? There's not been much of that done.

07:26.860 --> 07:34.740
Well, I hate to say it, but on the latest attempt on the book that I'm trying to do now, I've really broken myself down.

07:34.740 --> 07:42.960
I'm trying to get away from what I've done. I realize there's very often only a very few kinds of characters that I have in the prior four books.

07:43.880 --> 07:49.700
And the latest one, I'm trying to make the guy a little more of a positive personality.

07:50.300 --> 07:55.700
And as it's turned out, at least in the latest beginning, the fellow attorney general of the United States.

07:56.120 --> 08:02.640
So I guess that means something. I'm a little embarrassed by it, but it's something different.

08:04.260 --> 08:07.660
At least he's the attorney general of what's left of the United States.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.560
Have you ever read any books by Charles Harness?

08:12.700 --> 08:13.380
Yeah, I haven't.

08:13.560 --> 08:21.520
Okay. He's a patent lawyer, and he's one of my very favorite. He's one of these, another one of these people that produces a lot of books.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.840
He's produced six now, and he's about 65.

08:24.180 --> 08:27.980
But he has one that just came out called the Venetian Court, which is from a short story.

08:27.980 --> 08:38.680
I think it's about, I think it's in the near future, whenever if you violate a patent, or if you go around something that's patented and you do it anyway,

08:38.920 --> 08:42.840
that you get the death penalty and the lawyer argues the case.

08:43.580 --> 08:47.240
And he writes, he has some short stories that are pretty interesting about lawyers.

08:47.940 --> 08:54.560
And other than that, I don't think there's any other, there are very few lawyer protagonists or lawyer situations in science fiction.

08:54.560 --> 09:03.880
I really, none spring to mind that in my experience, that the guy, by the way, in this latest story, even though he is a lawyer or an attorney general,

09:04.420 --> 09:13.100
it's not going to be a law of story. He's going to have that position as much for symbolistic purposes as anything else.

09:15.400 --> 09:22.920
But it's not going to be real, what we do, courtroom battle in the past, future, or side time.

09:24.160 --> 09:30.380
If that may be an area, the last thing I want to get into is coming over from the law and writing to the court.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.260
I'm also afraid I just might get into second defending prostrations again, too.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.100
I'm not sure I could do that, especially.

09:40.020 --> 09:44.100
Okay, that's the end of my question list, so I'll turn the tapes off.

09:45.040 --> 09:50.580
I want to ask you just a couple of things off the cuff. When you were in law, you went to New York University.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.340
Where did you live? Did you live right by the University, right on Washington Square?

09:54.560 --> 09:55.900
Right on Washington Square.

09:56.200 --> 10:02.800
Well, I stayed, I had friends that lived in the village on 4th Street right there, just that side of 6th Avenue.

10:02.800 --> 10:07.380
We stayed there part of one summer and really had a great time.

10:08.440 --> 10:12.960
Well, it's a weird neighborhood as you recall. When were you there?

10:13.280 --> 10:16.280
This would have been the summer of 1976.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.920
Okay, well I was there from 1968 to 1971.

10:23.660 --> 10:29.300
The problem, of course, being in school is you got a lot to do. You don't have much money, even if you did have the time.

10:30.080 --> 10:34.800
And the law school itself is pretty much a closed little society. A lot of folks commute it.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.400
You're sure the tape isn't on?

10:39.820 --> 10:41.220
Yeah, no problem.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.240
Real dull bunch of people.

10:47.940 --> 10:56.300
Real, very much interested in Wall Street or Wall Street or Righteousness, hopefully combining the two.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.500
I don't know how they're going to do that.

10:58.180 --> 11:01.300
I was in a very good scholarship group, so I was fortunate in that aspect.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.220
I had some people I got along with.

11:04.580 --> 11:09.620
But, you know, it also had the classic New York syndrome, the world end at the Hudson River.

11:10.320 --> 11:14.500
Maybe to stand high enough, you can see the John Hancock, Karen Chicago and Golden Gate Bridge.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.520
And of course, everybody knows there's nothing in between.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.580
Very provincial.

11:20.460 --> 11:25.980
So that's, you know, there's a lot of good stuff around there, a lot of very exciting stuff.

11:26.180 --> 11:31.500
But as far as my day-to-day environment, pretty discouraging at all.

11:32.360 --> 11:37.040
I have a friend who went, she was, she's my age.

11:39.540 --> 11:44.220
She's a Columbia religion undergraduate.

11:44.980 --> 11:48.500
And then she messed around her husband with the grad school and all.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.340
He's a psych prof.

11:49.860 --> 11:52.820
And she's now in her third year at the University of Texas Law School.

11:53.240 --> 11:57.860
And it's been real interesting to see her, to see how she has changed because of law school.

11:58.000 --> 11:58.840
And she knows it.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.260
And just getting in that mindset.

12:01.760 --> 12:07.740
And I think her assessment of some of the people that was pretty dull, I think that's pretty true, by and large.

12:08.160 --> 12:08.760
Yeah, it is.

12:08.940 --> 12:12.880
And I'll tell you, the change in thinking, here's so much about thinking like a lawyer.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.580
It's not that much of a change.

12:14.920 --> 12:19.120
It becomes a little bit of a change because it's surrounded by the secret language.

12:19.320 --> 12:24.560
You know, you're picking up a couple of Captain Midnight words, nobody else, you know, the guy on the street doesn't know.

12:25.320 --> 12:30.180
You're learning things between you think about it, aren't terribly complicated, but by the same second they're a little artificial.

12:31.340 --> 12:37.660
So that, again, is unique because the average show doesn't know it.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.280
So you know something he doesn't.

12:39.280 --> 12:49.080
And as far as the techniques of thinking go, gee, the only real trick is just to think very carefully, logically and analytically.

12:49.560 --> 12:55.580
And if you do that, you know, and start with first things first, I mean, that's the great secret.

12:56.660 --> 13:06.940
As far as the business of the Socratic Method in class, you know, thinking like a lawyer, I really think it's considerably overblown.

13:08.860 --> 13:11.900
But don't tell her I may be wrong or if I'm right, that's what the maker said.

13:13.540 --> 13:16.540
I was glad you mentioned to talking about Kenyon.

13:16.660 --> 13:18.100
I had a friend that went to Kenyon.

13:18.900 --> 13:20.160
His name was Aaron Burke.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.220
I think he would have graduated quite a bit.

13:22.340 --> 13:22.860
You knew Aaron Burke?

13:23.160 --> 13:23.520
Yeah.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.200
Wait a minute, and he would have been a year older than me?

13:26.480 --> 13:28.080
Yeah, at least, uh-huh.

13:28.460 --> 13:29.280
Aaron the Baron?

13:29.740 --> 13:31.680
I didn't know him as Aaron the Baron.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.580
Dark hair always looks like they'll really burn down.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.900
Yeah, that's Aaron.

13:35.900 --> 13:36.920
Yeah, he was in my clinic.

13:37.640 --> 13:37.920
Oh, wow.

13:38.420 --> 13:46.440
He was a, let's see, when I was a senior in college, I was working in, I'm a chemist,

13:46.480 --> 13:51.000
and I was working in a lab for a professor in Aaron Post-Oct.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.500
This was at Rice.

13:53.900 --> 13:54.400
Yeah, right.

13:54.540 --> 13:55.840
He was in chemistry with a brilliant guy.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.860
Oh, very bright.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.280
Oh, I miss him.

13:58.620 --> 14:04.760
I learned a lot from him as far as chemistry and what I do, and then he was just a pretty nice guy.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.300
I saw him last in 1972.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.180
Oh, amazing.

14:10.980 --> 14:17.380
I'm glad I mentioned it then, because he always talked about Kenyon, and that's, it's a small world.

14:17.820 --> 14:18.780
Yeah, I should say.

14:19.020 --> 14:22.140
The Baron was, he was really quite a figure there.

14:22.440 --> 14:28.980
As far as I remember, he had three pair of jeans, two T-shirts, one change of linen, and a suit.

14:29.060 --> 14:29.740
He got his good will.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.140
I never saw him in his suit.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.720
Well, maybe he hadn't got a good will yet.

14:36.120 --> 14:41.540
It's really a, that's what I meant to say, I'm sure he's straightened out by the time he got out back in the real world,

14:41.720 --> 14:45.520
but that's along the lines of what I was talking about, the exit trophy of the place.

14:46.860 --> 14:50.740
Really, first-rate lines, not terribly stable though.

14:51.480 --> 14:56.580
Yeah, we had some, we used to play a lot of racquetball in the summers,

14:56.580 --> 15:04.120
and had some pretty amazing times at night, and got the munchies a lot at late hours, and that was a good time.

15:04.200 --> 15:04.740
I miss Aaron.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.860
That's, I'm glad I mentioned him.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.580
Okay, I'll let you go.

15:10.860 --> 15:11.720
I appreciate it.

15:11.760 --> 15:20.900
I was going to ask you to, if I could beg your indulgence, could I possibly send my four books and have them autographed?

15:20.940 --> 15:21.380
Oh, God.

15:21.380 --> 15:26.560
And I will put in the return postage and the label and all that, and I would be,

15:27.580 --> 15:28.480
Oh, well thank you.

15:28.540 --> 15:29.560
I do appreciate that.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.720
It's been really nice.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.980
I've gotten a kick out of this.

15:35.560 --> 15:40.300
It's nice to be able to talk to the people who might marvel at what they write, and I reread the stuff.

15:41.340 --> 15:46.940
I don't know how many times I've reread it now, but I wanted to reread it this week, and it's been great.

15:46.940 --> 15:51.460
And from a fan, please hurry up and write another one.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.540
That's exactly the encouragement I need.

15:54.980 --> 15:57.180
I think you might like the new one.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.260
Can I tell you what it's about?

15:58.340 --> 15:59.500
Yeah, I'll go right ahead.

15:59.780 --> 16:11.540
Okay, well, the idea is based upon what happens if for some one reason or another, the very finest portion of humanity simply leaves the planet.

16:13.120 --> 16:22.180
For one reason, I don't know exactly why they get fed up with things, but the very best of the doctors, scientists, God, I guess even the best lawyers can find them.

16:23.640 --> 16:27.640
For over a period of a few years, they just begin leaving and they're gone.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.620
And then afterwards, people realize that A, they are gone.

16:31.520 --> 16:41.500
B, that by leaving, it's the best of left, and what does that mean?

16:41.500 --> 16:42.740
It's very fine folks.

16:44.960 --> 16:56.540
And things after that for either because they left or because people think this is the result of their leaving, it just gets progressively worse and worse and worse.

16:57.280 --> 17:06.120
And after a period of about 40 or 50 years, however, they gradually stabilize after a lot of the usual chaos in this book.

17:06.960 --> 17:12.160
And that's why the heroes, the Attorney General of what's left of the United States, they only go to Chicago.

17:12.980 --> 17:16.740
I'm also having enough guts to actually put the story in real world parts.

17:19.040 --> 17:28.120
And a lot of the action resolves, not the gift of leaving, but the things finally beginning to calm down when it suddenly turns out that they're coming back.

17:32.060 --> 17:32.540
Okay.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.840
Are you think you'll submit it to Dawn?

17:36.660 --> 17:38.300
Well, I was real fortunate.

17:38.480 --> 17:49.500
One of those little stories that when I was a Kenyan, again, I was not in the English section because an English major, because I really thought they were much too intelligent, good for me.

17:50.940 --> 17:56.980
They had a novel, an apographer novel named Tom Fleming to speak to the Honors English section.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.100
I weeled in my way into a reception.

18:01.040 --> 18:03.820
I couldn't get into seminary and running at the time.

18:04.620 --> 18:09.180
But I, Madam, talked to him briefly and we had often discussed some of the problems.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
My first one had already come out by that time.

18:11.560 --> 18:26.960
He recommended his agent in New York, Malcolm Rees, at Paul Reynolds Agency, who I then saw and as it turned out, Rees, first of all, was just one of the people who I was talking to.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.180
I was a really first-rate guy, a real gentleman, I've met in my life.

18:30.900 --> 18:38.500
And he liked science fiction because he'd edited the Paul from the 30s and unknown to me is son had graduated from Kenyan a year or two ahead of me.

18:39.020 --> 18:41.520
So we had it off pretty well and he tried to pedal.

18:42.080 --> 18:51.100
I believe the day start didn't get anywhere and very graciously turned it back to me to just sell to Wolheim and not take a commission.

18:51.100 --> 18:59.200
And then he managed to sell Siege of Wunder to Double Day.

19:00.580 --> 19:04.600
The gentleman died after that but his son is now carrying on.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.320
And so I've got a name back there.

19:08.440 --> 19:13.380
Hopefully they'll remember me and if I get something I'll send it out to them and I'll circulate it around and see what happens.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.920
Great. We'll be watching for it.

19:18.540 --> 19:21.560
Thanks for keeping a lookout on the ones you have so far.

19:23.220 --> 19:29.540
Okay, thanks. It's been great. I'll send you the books within a couple of weeks and I do appreciate that.

19:30.320 --> 19:37.480
Okay, great. Have a good trip to Reno and we'll talk to you later, Mark. Good night now.
