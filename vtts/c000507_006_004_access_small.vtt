00:08.840 --> 00:12.760
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.380 --> 00:33.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.960
And here are your hosts.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.220
This is Daryl Lane.

00:43.320 --> 00:43.940
And Bill Vernon.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.340
You'll sometimes find that collectors of science fiction and fantasy books are into

00:47.340 --> 00:48.020
comics also.

00:48.380 --> 00:52.620
In fact, collecting comics is becoming a more widespread hobby all the time, and often

00:52.620 --> 00:56.300
you'll find collectible comics at a specialty store that handles science fiction, fantasy,

00:56.540 --> 00:57.500
and gaming material.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.900
Bob Wayne owns such a store in Fort Worth, Texas, called Fantastic World's Bookstore,

01:02.060 --> 01:03.220
and he also collects comics.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.320
When he asked him how an interested newcomer might get into comic book collecting, he had

01:07.320 --> 01:08.240
some words of caution.

01:09.100 --> 01:13.580
Well, the first recommendation I make to people is they come in and say, I read that

01:13.580 --> 01:17.960
a so-and-so comic book has gone up a thousand percent in two years.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.760
What comic book would you recommend that I should start collecting?

01:21.620 --> 01:28.220
I tell people that they really shouldn't be buying comics unless they enjoy reading comics.

01:28.900 --> 01:35.160
If there's nothing in that comic that they enjoy reading, then they're making a mistake

01:35.160 --> 01:39.780
getting into comics because there are other things they could invest money in that the

01:40.320 --> 01:43.320
people will not laugh at you when you go to the bank and tell them that you want to use

01:43.320 --> 01:44.020
it for collateral.

01:44.880 --> 01:49.420
So if a comic book has an investment, it's the kind of thing that's really been overplayed

01:49.420 --> 01:50.500
in the media to some extent.

01:50.980 --> 01:54.960
I mean, it sounds real good for the few comics that have appreciated a great deal in value,

01:55.460 --> 01:59.400
but speaking from experience, a bank does not really think that that's the kind of collateral

01:59.400 --> 02:00.800
they want to hold for a loan.

02:00.800 --> 02:05.280
So stocks and bonds still sound preferable to me as investments.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.040
But what if someone did take up comic book collecting?

02:08.380 --> 02:09.800
What about storing and preserving them?

02:10.340 --> 02:19.280
If you're going to keep a kind book for a collection, it's important to handle it carefully,

02:20.460 --> 02:26.180
and if you're going to keep it, you should bag it up, at least in a plastic bag.

02:26.660 --> 02:35.220
If you have a comic book that's worth over $50, $100, you might want to invest in bags

02:36.260 --> 02:40.960
of a type of plastic in which a lot of the things that would be in a plastic that would

02:40.960 --> 02:45.660
potentially cost the comic to an entry rate in 50 or 100 years would be neutralized.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.940
If you want to go further along, if you have comic books that are worth hundreds of dollars,

02:50.400 --> 02:55.220
there are things in the paper, the process of making pulp paper that will eventually

02:55.220 --> 02:55.980
cause it to rot.

02:56.100 --> 03:03.780
You can have this deacidified, but there's no point in doing this with just every comic

03:03.780 --> 03:04.440
book on the shelf.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.940
Actually, if you don't have any errors and you don't plan to be donating these to a

03:08.940 --> 03:13.140
library or something, the comic books that they're handled properly are going to outlive

03:13.140 --> 03:13.980
you most likely.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.900
There's no real danger involved.

03:17.540 --> 03:24.480
They should be kept away from high humidity and excessive extremes of temperature.

03:24.480 --> 03:28.920
They're kept in a dry and cool place and kept out of direct sunlight.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.180
Wayne pointed out to us that there's been a big change in the comic book industry in

03:38.180 --> 03:40.820
the past few years, one that will affect collectors.

03:41.880 --> 03:46.360
The biggest thing that's happened in comic books recently, probably the biggest thing

03:46.360 --> 03:52.200
that's happened since comic books began, is that the ownership of some of the characters

03:52.720 --> 03:59.700
is now being held by the individual creators in much the same way that a publisher does

03:59.700 --> 04:02.940
not own a novel by Isaac Asimov.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.000
Isaac Asimov would own the copyright.

04:05.780 --> 04:11.640
Now, comic books are coming out where the writer or the artist or both own the copyright

04:11.640 --> 04:16.360
to the character and the publisher is publishing it for them in the same kind of relationship

04:16.360 --> 04:18.600
that a book publisher has with a novelist.

04:18.600 --> 04:25.700
This is a complete change in the former system of the publisher owning everything, everything

04:25.700 --> 04:30.740
being done on a work for higher basis as though the artist was just coming in and doing the

04:30.740 --> 04:34.440
same type of function as sweeping the floors inside the corporate offices.

04:35.640 --> 04:42.260
This is going to be a change, it's going to become more and more evident in the next

04:42.260 --> 04:46.580
few years and it's going to create a lot of more excitement within the comic book field.

04:47.180 --> 04:50.060
We'll talk more about comics with Bob Wayne on our next show.

04:57.100 --> 05:01.480
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:01.480 --> 05:05.680
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.560
Thank you.

05:49.460 --> 05:53.620
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:09.260 --> 06:14.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:17.380 --> 06:18.820
And here are your hosts.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.740
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

06:24.920 --> 06:28.680
We're talking with Bob Wayne, comic book collector and owner of the Fantastic World's Bookstore

06:28.680 --> 06:29.660
in Fort Worth, Texas.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.320
Comic book collecting has become a rage recently.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.500
The prices of some collectible comics have risen almost 1000% in just a few years.

06:36.680 --> 06:40.560
On our last show, Bob Wayne explained some things about comic book collecting and advised

06:40.560 --> 06:43.860
the unwary newcomer to be extremely cautious when entering the field.

06:43.860 --> 06:47.920
He also mentioned a big change that's taken place recently in the publishing of comic books.

06:48.400 --> 06:52.800
The one who creates and draws a strip has complete rights over his work, just like the author of a novel.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.440
This means a comic book artist could change publishing companies and move to where he can get the best contract.

06:58.040 --> 07:01.420
We asked Wayne what this change would mean to collectors and he gave us an interesting answer.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.420
I have to go back a little bit.

07:04.680 --> 07:10.620
The other thing that has changed the comic industry is the change in distribution where, at one time,

07:10.620 --> 07:15.520
all the comic books were pretty much available at 7-Eleven's and drug stores.

07:16.100 --> 07:22.340
And at 7-Eleven bought them from a distributor, the same people used to that handle TV guide and time magazine and such things.

07:23.120 --> 07:27.440
And they got a bundle of comic books in and what they didn't sell, they sent back for credit.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.900
And this meant that the publishers had to print just like on anything else.

07:32.900 --> 07:39.200
They had to print, you know, let's say 500,000 and they sold 200,000 and 300,000 got thrown away.

07:40.720 --> 07:49.320
With the rise of specialty shops that sell comic books and science fiction books, those shops order their comics in a different fashion.

07:49.460 --> 07:54.380
They order them non-returnable. They get a better discount, but they have to keep everything they order.

07:55.520 --> 08:01.740
And it's now to the point where a lot of comic titles are being published only in the non-returnable format.

08:01.740 --> 08:08.120
So if a person is only buying their comic books at a 7-Eleven or in a small town that doesn't have a specialty store,

08:08.540 --> 08:10.640
there are a number of titles they would never have seen.

08:11.100 --> 08:20.200
In fact, there are titles that are being published only for specialty store distribution that are selling better than some of the comic books that have distribution in both forms.

08:20.740 --> 08:29.580
Examples of this would be Camelot 3000 from DC Comics, which takes the King Arthur saga, brings it back to life, but in the year 3000.

08:29.580 --> 08:38.940
Star Slayer from Pacific Comics just moving to another company called First Comics, which takes a man from out of the past and springs him into the future,

08:39.460 --> 08:44.380
where he goes around and finds alien menaces and zooms from galaxy to galaxy.

08:45.460 --> 08:49.340
These titles are only published in specialty stores.

08:49.340 --> 08:57.260
And the thing with the book like Star Slayer, which is written and drawn by Mike Grell, who used to work for DC Comics doing The Warlord,

08:57.660 --> 09:00.760
is that Mike Grell owns the copyright to Star Slayer.

09:02.080 --> 09:10.460
And the fact that Mike Grell owns the copyright means that when his contract with the publisher Pacific Comics expired with issue number 6,

09:10.460 --> 09:17.940
he was able to find a better deal and make more money from himself and take it to First Comics, a new publishing company out of Chicago,

09:18.680 --> 09:20.420
for starting with issue number 7.

09:31.460 --> 09:36.620
Wayne says this change, which allows a comic book character to switch publishing companies, is a very recent one,

09:36.620 --> 09:39.760
and he likens it to the situation that exists in book publishing.

10:00.840 --> 10:04.940
Some of the ramifications of this new situation should be obvious to collectors.

10:04.940 --> 10:11.440
One difference may well be that a collector devoted to a particular character or artist will have to follow him through a number of publishing companies.

10:11.900 --> 10:16.360
Perhaps a collector will be required to buy more issues too in order to acquire a complete set of something.

10:16.960 --> 10:22.780
Also, it should be more difficult to locate and catalog characters and artists, since they will probably be spread out over more companies.

10:23.120 --> 10:27.460
But for dedicated comic book collectors, the new situation may be a beneficial one after all.

10:27.740 --> 10:33.220
Sure, with more competition, there will likely be more comics and more artists, and therefore more material for collectors to work with.

10:40.180 --> 10:45.620
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

10:45.880 --> 10:48.780
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.940
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:55.520 --> 12:00.840
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.140
And here are your hosts.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.100
This is Darrell Lane and David Carson.

12:11.700 --> 12:16.000
Poetry and science fiction, two unlikely candidates for a merger, but they go together very well.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.920
As practitioners of the art and members of the Science Fiction Poetry Association will tell you.

12:20.120 --> 12:26.260
The Science Fiction Radio Show spoke with some people in the Science Fiction Poetry Association about what exactly Science Fiction Poetry is.

12:26.260 --> 12:30.860
Gene Van Troyer, Science Fiction Author and Editor of a mainstream literary magazine, responds.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.080
Well, it's been around for quite a while.

12:33.300 --> 12:37.980
It's only been really in recent years that the term Science Fiction Poetry came into usage.

12:38.120 --> 12:45.700
I think about 1974 was when the term was first used and it was coined by, well, it wasn't coined by anybody,

12:45.880 --> 12:54.800
but it was just used as a label by Peter Dillingham, who was an early prosodist and theorist of Science Fiction Poetry.

12:54.800 --> 13:04.240
And Stephen Gregg, who edited Eternity Science Fiction, which was the first Science Fiction magazine to really incorporate poetry as an integral part of its format.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.760
What is Science Fiction Poetry?

13:07.480 --> 13:15.300
Well, I really can't say what Science Fiction Poetry is in terms of a definition because no one has ever defined science fiction or poetry.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.040
So Science Fiction Poetry has no real definition.

13:18.040 --> 13:28.820
But I generally tend to class Science Fiction Poetry as something containing an element which is usually associated with Science Fiction.

13:29.480 --> 13:36.100
In other words, a speculative element of outer space or of biology or of time or whatnot.

13:36.660 --> 13:38.880
So that's my loose definition.

13:39.460 --> 13:47.160
It's important to realize that what we now are calling Science Fiction Poetry has been written in the so-called mainstream for a long time.

13:47.160 --> 13:56.380
William Blake is a really primary example of someone who wrote mystical poetry, but in order to do it, he created alternate worlds

13:56.380 --> 14:06.800
and an ability to travel between this world or the world of London that he knew and his imaginary England, which he called Albion.

14:07.380 --> 14:14.380
Well, that's fantasy. That's Science Fiction. That's alternate world imagination.

14:16.360 --> 14:24.940
In more modern times, there's W. H. Auden, who has written a number of poems which would be scientifically oriented as well as Science Fiction Poetry

14:24.940 --> 14:31.100
because they speculate about eventual results of scientific discoveries.

14:31.820 --> 14:40.640
One of the most striking examples of what I would call Science Fiction Poetry is something that was done by Richard Wilbur, a well-established mainstream poet.

14:40.640 --> 14:47.800
This poem is called The Mind Reader. This is a poem about a person who actually reads minds and he makes his living by reading minds.

14:48.640 --> 14:56.300
Now, I don't think Richard Wilbur would call it Science Fiction, although maybe in the back of his mind he's working with the idea that, well, this is usually a Science Fiction theme.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.500
But it's really a very well-done poem.

14:59.380 --> 15:08.300
The point about Science Fiction Poetry and mainstream poetry is that to be a good poem, a Science Fiction Poem must first be a good poem.

15:08.300 --> 15:16.000
And then content-wise, it diverges from what we normally recognize or would normally class as mainstream poetry.

15:25.060 --> 15:33.980
The Science Fiction Poetry Association was founded in 1978 by Suzette Hayden Elgin, a mainstream novelist, who saw there was no meeting point for poets in the Science Fiction field.

15:33.980 --> 15:43.060
There are a number of well-known Science Fiction writers who are members of the Science Fiction Poetry Association. Theodore Sturgeon, Ursula Le Guin, Gregory Benford, Ed Bryant, and Gene Wolfe are a few.

15:43.640 --> 15:49.460
We asked Bob Frazier, editor of the Science Fiction Poetry Association newsletter, to tell us what the newsletter accomplishes.

15:50.020 --> 16:00.120
At the moment, the newsletter seems to be the focus of the organization because we don't have any great amount of business that is important to us.

16:00.120 --> 16:16.480
We're sort of like a very small, non-profit organization, just basically people getting to know each other and setting up workshops at conventions, doing readings, teaching each other a little bit about poetry, helping each other find good markets.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.940
We'll talk more about poetry and science fiction on our next show.

16:26.600 --> 16:35.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.920
The show is a production of the Science Fiction Poetry Association, produced by Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:21.380 --> 17:25.380
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:40.980 --> 17:46.280
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.560
And here are your hosts.

17:54.660 --> 17:56.700
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

17:57.060 --> 18:04.720
We are speaking with some of the members of the Science Fiction Poetry Association, practicing poets and science fiction authors who feel that poetry and science fiction go well together.

18:05.380 --> 18:11.760
We asked Bob Frazier, editor of the Science Fiction Poetry Association newsletter, Starline, if most of the group's members are science fiction fans.

18:12.760 --> 18:31.300
It seems to work out that way, but percentage-wise it's probably, well, 75%, I would say, but I should think it should be 90% in one sense, and I feel it shows that we do have at least 25% membership of people who are just interested in poetry altogether, which is healthy.

18:31.560 --> 18:38.540
I mean, we're not trying to be separate from the mainstream of literary mainstream with poetry, that's for sure.

18:39.260 --> 18:42.520
What's the difference between regular poetry and science fiction poetry?

18:43.360 --> 19:04.600
Well, there's several arguments about that. I think my basic viewpoint is that if it's science fiction or fantasy poetry, if it's published within that genre, and because a lot of the poetry really doesn't necessarily have to have unicorns or spaceships in it, a lot of it can be about very peripheral things.

19:04.980 --> 19:06.600
I'd call them speculative things.

19:07.460 --> 19:10.080
We asked Frazier for an example of something speculative.

19:11.080 --> 19:19.520
Well, have you ever picked up a telephone and heard someone talking on the line somewhere far in the distance? It's another conversation between two other people.

19:20.080 --> 19:28.920
Well, say you wrote a poem about that in the context of like there were telephone ghosts that kind of live in the telephone line, okay?

19:29.380 --> 19:41.220
That would be a mainstream poem, or it could be a science fiction poem, because it deals sort of in that the same realm that imagination, that fantastic imagination is in.

19:48.580 --> 19:56.560
We asked Gene Van Troyer, science fiction poet and author, if there was anything in style or technique that distinguished regular poetry from science fiction poetry.

19:57.500 --> 20:13.040
Any style can be used. You can use it in very rigidly metered and rhymed poetic forms, which we usually call traditional poetic forms, sestinas, sonnets, villainils, and so forth.

20:13.300 --> 20:24.020
Or it can use the free verse or modern poetic techniques that you would see, say, William Carlos Williams using or Charles Olson using.

20:24.580 --> 20:29.140
We asked Bob Frazier to give us some titles of books and magazines that contain science fiction poetry.

20:30.200 --> 20:37.660
I suggest a book called Holding Your Aid Hands. It's been reprinted as a paperback by Doubleday last year.

20:37.960 --> 20:44.140
Originally it was published in 1969. The editor is Edward Lucy Smith, and it's a collection of science fiction poetry.

20:46.020 --> 20:53.160
An international collection, actually, although not widely international as British and I think some Australian authors and American authors in it.

20:55.460 --> 21:08.400
There's an anthology of poetry coming out from a man here in Denver, Steve Razznick Tim, and it's an offshoot of a magazine he's been editing of speculative poetry for three or four years.

21:08.960 --> 21:16.820
It's called The Umbrellan Anthology, and it will use poetry out of what I see as the history of science fiction poetry.

21:18.360 --> 21:30.300
There's also coming up, an anthology in a couple of years by Bruce McAlister and Dick Allen, who are both writers of science fiction poetry and both people who work in academic jobs in the United States,

21:31.040 --> 21:35.800
which is going to attempt to do the same thing, create a comprehensive anthology of some sort.

21:37.280 --> 21:42.880
And there is Starline, which is our newsletter, which publishes original poetry.

21:42.880 --> 21:49.780
Markets, we have a workshop in there. We have news related to science fiction and poetry.

21:50.640 --> 21:56.140
We have letter columns and everything that basically ties our organization together.

21:56.780 --> 22:00.100
We'll conclude our discussion of science fiction and poetry on our next show.

22:06.360 --> 22:15.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:03.120 --> 23:07.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:22.700 --> 23:28.000
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.280
And here are your hosts.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.080
This is Derek from The Crescent of Science Fiction Radio Show.

23:37.860 --> 23:42.900
This will be our final show on science fiction and poetry and on the Science Fiction Poetry Association.

23:53.320 --> 24:00.180
They publish a newsletter, meet occasionally at science fiction conventions, read each other's poems, and help each other find markets for their work.

24:09.540 --> 24:23.300
Yes, today science has found some things about the universe, especially let's use physics as an example, or found some things because science has become so specialized.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.840
And that any scientist today is almost a specialist in his field.

24:28.220 --> 24:34.380
We're discovering the real depths of a lot of science, including psychology, but let's pick physics, okay.

24:34.380 --> 24:45.500
They've come up against things like black holes, singularities, monopoles, and these are things which cannot be systematically and rationally explained.

24:46.360 --> 24:57.580
And you will find in the scientific texts that are discussing these possibilities, these kind of rips in Einsteinian space-time continuum, or however you want to look at them, they're anomalies.

24:59.120 --> 25:10.860
The science books are using, like Carl Sagan will use a poem, for example, to help explain, to help visualize what it could possibly be or how it exists.

25:11.560 --> 25:22.420
And because poetry can in a small space deal with something which can be abstract, it doesn't always have to be abstract and doesn't have to be unreadable and doesn't have to be boring,

25:22.420 --> 25:28.020
but because it can deal with some things that are abstract in a small amount of space.

25:28.880 --> 25:38.600
Poetry can be, or poetic talk, even if it's in a prose sense or even in a speech, can deal with abstract things nicely.

25:46.140 --> 25:53.720
Gene Van Troyer, author and poet in the science fiction field, sees science fiction poetry as a significant recombining of two things that should go together.

25:54.500 --> 26:05.860
I think one thing that's important to distinguish also is that science fiction poetry itself, I think, represents a refusion of science and poetry.

26:06.700 --> 26:22.940
Up until the last decade, as a matter of fact, it was very vogue-ish, very fattish for poets and poetry-type people to view poetry and art and science as mutually exclusive.

26:23.680 --> 26:34.480
And this is a totally artificial separation because poetic expression comes from the same wellsprings that the ordering process we see in science comes from.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.340
It's the need to put order on the universe.

26:37.700 --> 26:43.500
Well, in the Renaissance, you didn't see this really drastic split between science and art.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.640
They were viewed as being the same thing.

26:46.040 --> 26:54.320
But I mentioned William Blake earlier, and it seems to me that around the time of William Blake, disillusionment with the industrial revolution in science was already setting in,

26:54.400 --> 26:57.560
and William Blake is rabidly anti-science.

26:59.080 --> 27:06.820
Personally, I feel that he was mistaken in this particular aspect, but he looked around the world that he saw and things were terrible.

27:07.360 --> 27:15.480
People were enslaved almost by the industrial system, and he was just rabidly opposed to it because it oppressed the spirit, it oppressed the soul.

27:15.480 --> 27:27.980
Well, now, I think this is a forerunner of the split that gradually grew from about the latter part of the 18th century up until the present time in the 20th century.

27:28.300 --> 27:37.920
But it's gradually coming back together, and you see a lot more science showing up in poetry and poets feeling much more confident about expressing things out of science in their poetry,

27:38.280 --> 27:42.060
as well as scientists falling back on poetry to explicate things.

27:49.080 --> 27:57.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.980
Thank you.
