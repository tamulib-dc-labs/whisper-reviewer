Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.360 --> 00:33.740
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.120
And here are your hosts.

00:43.480 --> 00:51.740
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. Warren Norwood, a newly emerged science
fiction writer who is a finalist in the balloting for the 1983 John W. Campbell

00:51.740 --> 00:59.920
Award, the award given annually to the best new writer. Norwood hit the scene
with his first novel in a series dubbed The Windhover Tapes. Volume 1 is An

00:59.920 --> 01:09.020
Image of Voices, Volume 2 Flexing the Warp, and Volume 3 Fize of the Gabriel
Ratchets. The protagonist is Gerard Manley, a spacefaring diplomat who journeys

01:09.020 --> 01:17.200
in a sentient craft called the Windhover. We asked Norwood if by any coincidence
the series had anything to do with Gerard Manley Hopkins, the 19th century

01:17.200 --> 01:24.100
English poet. Yeah, it's my left-handed salute to the old man. I mean, I think
he was a poet who was probably 100 years ahead of his time.

01:27.800 --> 01:36.780
He's not one of those poets that you walk around reciting verses to at people's
parties, but I think he did marvelous. I think he took marvelous chances with

01:36.780 --> 01:45.560
the language and marvelous chances with poetry, and some of it is just, you
know, it's breathtaking. But no one's going to read a tribute to Gerard Manley

01:45.560 --> 01:58.460
Hopkins. So when I sat down to do the story, I had already decided that I was
going to name the ship Windhover, which is his most famous poem, The Windhover.

01:59.760 --> 02:07.160
And it just seemed, you know, the natural thing to do, to name the character
Gerard Manley, and especially since he is interested in poetry, right? And then

02:07.160 --> 02:18.180
in the second book, when Gerard finds himself at the end of his road and thinks
this is going to be it, it's going to be all over, he writes a poem to GM, which

02:18.180 --> 02:30.160
is himself, right? But it's also the poem to Gerard Manley Hopkins. And it
echoes the language of The Windhover, Hopkins' The Windhover. It echoes that

02:30.160 --> 02:38.140
language and asks some of the same questions only from Gerard's point of view
rather than from Hopkins' point of view. So yeah, it's all very intentional. I

02:38.140 --> 02:46.740
mean, with 54-hour minor in English, it's hard to be unintentional about things
like that. So the series is filled with all sorts of allusions to Hopkins that

02:46.740 --> 02:54.440
should please any English major. We were curious about the type of audience at
which Norwood was aiming. After all, not all readers are English majors. I think

02:54.440 --> 03:04.640
it was Raymond Chandler, but I'm not sure who said that I write first to
entertain myself and hope that others are entertained. I had a certain audience

03:04.640 --> 03:16.480
awareness in that when I went back and did the second draft, I simplified the
language somewhat from the original draft because I thought I had gotten too

03:16.480 --> 03:29.260
carried away. But I didn't write it thinking of a specific audience. For those
books, I really didn't have an audience in mind. It was just a story that I had

03:29.260 --> 03:40.240
been thinking about for eight or nine months, and I wanted to tell. And that
seemed more important. And then when I made the decision about how to tell the

03:40.240 --> 03:49.800
story, I knew, without deliberating on it a great deal, that I had limited my
audience. But I thought, well, I'm willing to take the chance because I figured

03:49.800 --> 03:54.200
I needed something to break into the market, and I think you have to take
chances to do that.

04:04.760 --> 04:13.300
Manley is a galactic diplomat in An Image of Voices, although he abandons this
role in the subsequent novels. Say galactic diplomat to a science fiction fan,

04:13.440 --> 04:23.960
and he'll respond, Retief, meaning Keith Laumer's famous protagonist. We asked
Norwood if Retief influenced the character of Gerard Manley. I tried to make

04:23.960 --> 04:38.580
Gerard not like Retief, right, while still maintaining that intergalactic
diplomat role. I tried to make him a very different kind of diplomat. But there

04:38.580 --> 04:45.780
were times, in fact, in the first draft, there are sections where it got a
little Retief-like, kind of unconsciously, and then I had to go back and say,

04:45.860 --> 04:53.420
gee, I think I read this somewhere before, and I didn't write it. And then you
have to go back and clean things up. More with Warren Norwood on our next show.

05:00.740 --> 05:08.460
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:08.460 --> 05:09.220
Odessa, Texas.

05:52.760 --> 05:56.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.480 --> 06:17.860
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.260
And here are your hosts.

06:26.460 --> 06:33.480
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon. The cover on each novel in Warren Norwood's
Science Fiction series, The Windhover Tapes, features a complimentary blurb

06:33.480 --> 06:40.500
written by Anne McCaffrey, the author of the famous dragon books. McCaffrey
wrote in a blurb on the back of the first novel, An Image of Voices, that she

06:40.500 --> 06:48.440
had known of Norwood's ambitions for four years. We asked Norwood about his
relationship with Anne McCaffrey. I was a book salesman for Ballantine.

06:49.260 --> 06:59.900
Ballantine Del Rey did the McCaffrey dragon books, among others. And when she
did the first promotion tour around the country for the hardcover edition of

06:59.900 --> 07:09.220
White Dragon, I cornered the Del Rey direct salesman and said, If you don't get
her into some of my wholesale accounts, you know, I'm going to break your knees.

07:10.100 --> 07:17.880
Besides, I want to meet her. I mean, there's other reasons besides. So I got her
into, I think, three of the accounts, and then we took her to the airport

07:17.880 --> 07:25.820
together, and her plane was an hour and a half late. So we sat in the bar in the
airport drinking Coors beer, which is one of her favorites, and she can't get in

07:25.820 --> 07:35.920
Ireland, and listening to Annie tell stories, which is a marvelous experience in
and of itself. When she came back the following year for the paperback tour for

07:35.920 --> 07:44.340
White Dragon, my wife and I picked her up at the airport, took her to the hotel
in Dallas, which was on fire at the time, so that was all very exciting. She was

07:44.340 --> 07:54.300
extremely tired. It was the 23rd day of a 28-day tour in 31 cities or something
like that, and she was beginning. So we ended up staying until like 1 or 2 o

07:54.300 --> 08:01.960
'clock in the morning because she couldn't sleep and just talking and chatting,
and then I took her around all the next day with a case of Coors beer iced down

08:01.960 --> 08:10.080
in the back and about three melons all diced up because you can't get fresh
melon in Ireland either, right? So she munched on melon and drank Coors beer all

08:10.080 --> 08:16.360
day while we toured Dallas and Fort Worth and visited bookstores and radio
stations and developed a grand rapport and ended up at the airport drinking

08:16.360 --> 08:25.980
Coors beer and having a wonderful time. So we corresponded then fairly
regularly. I say fairly regularly three or four times a year after that, and

08:25.980 --> 08:33.660
after I'd finished the book and Bantam had bought it, they said, you know, who
do you know? And I said, well, the author I know best is Anne McCaffrey, and so

08:33.660 --> 08:41.200
I asked her, I said, you know, would you read it? And she said yes, and then she
said those wonderful things, and I don't remember anything for about a week

08:41.200 --> 08:51.320
after getting that letter, you know. Annie's letter was as much of a high as the
sale, right, because it was some kind of confirmation that I had in fact done it

08:51.320 --> 08:55.600
right. Yeah. It was as much of a high as the sale was itself.

09:21.780 --> 09:27.960
Norwood originally envisioned the Windhover Tapes as a trilogy, and he wrote it
as such. But then it was announced later that the series would be four books

09:27.960 --> 09:37.640
long, a tetralogy. We asked Norwood why the change. Anne McCaffrey. It's Anne
McCaffrey's fault. I don't blame it on Annie. She wrote after she, she has read

09:37.640 --> 09:45.180
all the books in manuscript now. When after she finished the third book, she
wrote me this long, long letter asking me this whole list of questions. She

09:45.180 --> 09:51.080
said, you have answered all the main questions in the story. I'm not objecting
to that, but I want to know this, and I want to know that, and I want to know

09:51.080 --> 09:56.360
this, and I want to know that, and are you ever going to talk about this, and
are you ever going to talk about that? And she said, either write me a long

09:56.360 --> 10:07.160
letter back or write another book. So I laughingly shared that letter with my
editor and started thinking about the answers to those questions, but it hadn't

10:07.160 --> 10:14.380
gotten beyond that point until the first book started to sell really well. And
then my editor said, gee, you ought to think about the fourth book. And I said,

10:14.480 --> 10:22.460
well, the only way I'll do a fourth book if it's the final book, because I don't
want an endless series. If I can make this the final book, and under these

10:22.460 --> 10:30.440
conditions, then I will write it, and I will answer Annie's question. So the
fourth book is going to be to answer Annie's questions. I mean, that's what

10:30.440 --> 10:38.260
started the whole thing. It's Anne McCaffrey's fault. Bless her heart. We'll
have more with Warren Norwood on our next show.

10:45.500 --> 10:53.340
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:53.340 --> 10:54.100
Odessa, Texas.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.360
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:03.140 --> 12:08.560
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.960
And here are your hosts.

12:17.280 --> 12:25.840
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. A number of people write poetry. They do so
for various reasons, among them for escape, as a creative outlet, or for self

12:25.840 --> 12:32.920
-expression. Quite a few science fiction writers compose poetry as well. Gene
Wolfe, Ray Bradbury, and Michael Bishop, for instance. But it's virtually

12:32.920 --> 12:41.200
impossible to make a living solely by writing and selling poetry. A few
magazines and anthologies purchase poems, but the pay is a pittance. The poets

12:41.200 --> 12:47.800
among us must write it for love, not money. But one science fiction writer,
Warren Norwood, has chosen a different tack. As we discussed previously, his

12:47.800 --> 12:56.480
Windhover series owes a lot to the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. Norwood, a poet
as well as a writer, inserts his own poems in his novels. Fury comments on this

12:56.480 --> 13:08.000
practice. Oh, yes, yes. One of the modus operandi in the very beginning was to
bootleg the poetry into the story. In fact, it was the Tenderfoot cycle of poems

13:08.000 --> 13:16.320
which helped me formulate how I wanted to put the story together. And all the
Tenderfoot poems aren't in there, fortunately.

13:19.200 --> 13:29.940
But that was part of what I wanted to do in the books because I thought, again,
that was something else that was... I was taking enough chances. I thought, I'll

13:29.940 --> 13:33.600
take one more. I'll go ahead and try this and see what happens.

13:36.320 --> 13:45.060
I've been writing poetry since I was nine, so I obviously believe in it in some
form or another. So I thought, why not do that and see if we can make it work?

13:45.180 --> 13:54.040
And I was very fortunate and found an editor who believed in it after having
talked to several others who did not believe in it at all. We wondered if

13:54.040 --> 14:07.240
writing poetry helped Norwood write fiction. I think so because if you write
poetry regularly and try constantly to improve it, then you're constantly

14:07.240 --> 14:16.520
working with the language. You're constantly trying to squeeze from the language
as much meaning as possible. So it makes you extremely cognizant of words and

14:16.520 --> 14:28.060
their meanings and their subtleties and shades of meanings. I think that writing
poetry can also hurt your prose. I think that you can, in fact, get too poetic.

14:28.060 --> 14:37.920
You're trying to put too much in. You're trying to make your prose too poetic. I
think it's... I marvel at some of the stuff that Gene Wolfe writes. I mean, I

14:37.920 --> 14:54.880
think some of his prose just blows me away. But at the same time, I think that
sometimes he sticks with a level of writing that is almost too poetic for the

14:54.880 --> 15:03.520
part of the story he's trying to tell, that instead of doing it in rhythms, he's
so caught up in that rhythm, so caught up in that level, that poetic level, that

15:03.520 --> 15:11.300
he can't bring it down to a faster, cleaner action scene where you get out of
that and you sweep the reader along and then pull them back up to another poetic

15:11.300 --> 15:24.260
height. And so I think, you know, this is not to criticize Gene Wolfe, but it's
to say that I think that because he is a poet and because he is so poetically

15:24.260 --> 15:34.720
involved with the language that it has detracted a little bit from what he might
have otherwise done with the story. Of course, all this is envy on my part

15:34.720 --> 15:44.400
because if I could write prose like Gene Wolfe writes, I would be a very happy
man. Gerard Manley, Norwood's protagonist in the Windhover tape series, analyzes

15:44.400 --> 15:50.940
poetry for many worlds in his spare time with the help of his sentient ship,
Windhover. We asked Norwood if there are present-day computers capable of

15:50.940 --> 16:03.100
analyzing poetry in the same fashion. Very crude ones at this stage of the game,
but there's been work that's been done on that. Several universities have done

16:03.100 --> 16:15.300
experimental programming with programming computers to write poetry, programming
computers to translate poetry, and it's all at a very crude level so my

16:15.300 --> 16:24.960
extrapolation of that is a big stretch, but I thought given the progress of
technology that in 7,000 years it seemed reasonable that we'd figure out how to

16:24.960 --> 16:28.620
do it. We'll have more with Warren Norwood on our next show.

16:35.780 --> 16:43.760
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:43.760 --> 16:44.520
Odessa, Texas.

17:28.120 --> 17:32.080
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:47.860 --> 17:53.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.640
And here are your hosts.

18:02.080 --> 18:08.460
This is Daryl Lane. And to Bill Vernon. Warren Norwood's series, The Windhover
Tapes, is an imaginative blend of hard science and characterization. The

18:08.460 --> 18:17.200
protagonist is Gerard Manley, a space-faring diplomat and scholar. Much of the
first two volumes is written in a unique style, internal dialogue between Manley

18:17.200 --> 18:26.040
and his self. Manley recalls dreams in the early volumes. These allow him to
reconstruct his past, a past detailed in the third volume, Fize of the Gabriel

18:26.040 --> 18:39.240
Ratchets. We asked Norwood if he dreams as Manley does. I dreamed a great deal
from the time I, well, from somewhere in the middle of Vietnam until about six,

18:39.380 --> 18:49.460
seven years afterward. And I think that's the major influence on Gerard's
dreams. And they were very vivid and they were very recallable in the same way

18:49.460 --> 18:57.560
that he recalls them, where I could, they would start as fragments when I woke
up and then I could pull them back. I could bring more pieces back into the

18:57.560 --> 19:07.480
dream. That kind of faded off after about six, seven years after I got back from
Vietnam and I don't do nearly as much of it. But that's where it came from, that

19:07.480 --> 19:19.560
process came from. And then in Gerard's case, it's part of what he suspects and
it's, he's getting a mirror image of what was a prescient talent and his

19:19.560 --> 19:25.980
prescience in effect kind of turned around and giving him a way to look back
into his past, warped by the mind wipers.

19:47.080 --> 19:54.400
Norwood does not write science fiction in the lecture mode. Rather, he allows
the context of the story to explain itself. He relies on other devices as well.

19:55.000 --> 20:05.980
I did what a great number of science fiction writers do and that is I built on
what had gone before and there's such a huge basis now of groundwork that has

20:05.980 --> 20:14.360
been done for us that we don't have to spend a lot of time explaining how this
works and how that works and, you know, oh, actually, this warp takes us through

20:14.360 --> 20:22.880
tachyon space, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? We
can just use key words and key concepts and the reader has already been grounded

20:22.880 --> 20:34.360
in that and then you can spend more time telling the story instead of having
more time explaining all the mechanical functions. There's a hard science,

20:34.480 --> 20:42.520
there's a big hard science story that I really want to write but I don't think I
have the skills yet as a writer to do it so I'm saving that one for when I'm

20:42.520 --> 20:51.160
better trained in my craft. We mentioned that Norwood's series is a character
study as well. A good example is Norwood's treatment of Manley's relationship

20:51.160 --> 20:59.540
with his wife, ShRil. Manley meets ShRil early in the first volum, An Image of
Voices. She is a researcher on the planet Moseen, there to research universal

20:59.540 --> 21:07.940
legends among civilized worlds. Manley shares this interest too. Manley and ShRil
slowly fall in love. In the second volume, Flexing the Warp, they marry in an

21:07.940 --> 21:15.280
elaborate ceremony. A good bit of Flexing the Warp deals with ShRil's
pregnancy. This is certainly a novelty in a science fiction work. The details

21:15.280 --> 21:23.220
are so vivid and realistic that we had to ask Norwood if he had gone through a
pregnancy himself. Through the pregnancy and through a miscarriage before it, so

21:23.220 --> 21:32.320
that I took all that and you write what you know and so I put that in there
because those were very important times of my life when they happened. I was

21:32.320 --> 21:40.660
there when my daughter was born in the delivery room and that's why we got to
have the big group scene when CrRina is born and I thought, everybody ought to

21:40.660 --> 21:49.380
get to share this experience because it was really a lot of fun. And one of
those, again, one of those gratifying things is to have a fan come up and say,

21:50.180 --> 21:58.320
gee, I really like, female fans especially, you really got that down, I really
understand that. Or husbands come up and say, my wife was like that when she was

21:58.320 --> 22:09.760
pregnant. I mean, Gerard makes a wonderful comment in there that maybe women
change species when they're pregnant. There's some biological basis for that. On

22:09.760 --> 22:11.520
our next show, more with Warren Norwood.

22:18.600 --> 22:26.540
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:26.540 --> 22:27.300
Odessa, Texas.

23:14.200 --> 23:18.180
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:33.980 --> 23:39.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.780
And here are your hosts.

23:48.180 --> 23:56.360
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. Ever wonder how an author goes about writing
a book, how the storyline develops, where characters come from? We had occasion

23:56.360 --> 24:08.160
to ask these questions of science fiction writer Warren Norwood. Character with
a problem. That's how most of my stories begin, is character with a problem. I

24:08.160 --> 24:20.960
write short stories that are unsaleable because the characters have problems
that are either so bizarre or so obscene. Or something else that, even though

24:20.960 --> 24:26.500
the problem gets resolved by the end of the story that no one's really
interested, that's fine because I just write them for fun. They're characters

24:26.500 --> 24:33.940
who pop into my head with this particular problem and I let them run through
that section of their lives until they solve the problem. And then they go back

24:33.940 --> 24:41.260
in the drawer and I've gotten them out of my head, which is the most important
thing. But I start with a character with a problem and very shortly thereafter,

24:41.820 --> 24:55.780
I say shortly, usually in terms of two to three weeks for a novel length work, I
have a very good idea of how the story ends. So I have a beginning and an ending

24:55.780 --> 25:03.480
and the middle is just, it's like standing, I remember as a kid standing the
first time we went through Tennessee and standing on one of those overlooks and

25:03.480 --> 25:10.380
looking out across to the mountains on the other side and there was nothing but
fog and mist in the bottom. Well, that's kind of how I feel when I get ready to

25:10.380 --> 25:16.360
start a novel. I know where I am and I know where the mountain is on the other
side, but what's in the middle there, I don't know, except you have to go down

25:16.360 --> 25:25.980
and you have to come back up in order to get there. And then that middle
resolves itself in a very vague way as I begin the story. Norwood then told us

25:25.980 --> 25:35.680
that after the story is set, the characters often develop lives of their own.
And I found the more that I try to put my characters through paces in the middle

25:35.680 --> 25:44.720
to do certain things, the less cooperative they become. So what I try to do then
is tap them back in the line when they start pushing the plot too far away. I

25:44.720 --> 25:52.020
think I'll never get to the end this way if you guys keep going left, edge a
little right and make me happy. So I nudge them back to the right a little bit

25:52.020 --> 25:59.460
and then they head back there and then they go way off too far to the right and
then you have to nudge them back to the left. It's a strange process. Especially

25:59.460 --> 26:06.140
when they come alive in the back of your head and they start saying things and
doing things that you didn't expect them to do. An example of this process can

26:06.140 --> 26:14.500
be seen in ShRil, the lead female character in Norwood's Windhover tape
series. ShRil's pregnancy is a perfect example of that. I mean, she wasn't

26:14.500 --> 26:20.080
supposed to get pregnant for another six months in this story because I had to
get them where they were going first, right? I was going to have her get

26:20.080 --> 26:27.540
pregnant someplace safe. Oh, no, she had to get pregnant. And then she and
Gerard had to argue about it and then I was angry at both of them and then I had

26:27.540 --> 26:33.960
to back off and take five pages out of the manuscript and say, wait a minute.
Take them back to the beginning of that scene and say, it's your problem. You

26:33.960 --> 26:40.220
work it out. I'll write it down. You just tell me what to write down. And so I
let them argue about the problem and solve their difficulties and it was all

26:40.220 --> 26:49.740
fine. And I learned a valuable lesson. Keep your cotton-picking hands off their
lives when they're doing it themselves. Norwood recently published a novel with

26:49.740 --> 26:58.080
Ralph Mylius called The Seren Cenacles. The independence their characters
achieved caused interesting problems for the co-authors. When Ralph and I did

26:58.080 --> 27:12.320
our book, one of the things that happened was we started with a male protagonist
and then a minor protagonist who was female. And she came alive for me about the

27:12.320 --> 27:21.380
same time that he came alive for Ralph. And so Ralph was writing the first draft
and he was putting words in her mouth and then when I was reading it and getting

27:21.380 --> 27:27.900
ready to write the second draft, she was in the back of my head screaming, no,
no, no, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't react like that. So I'd get on the phone

27:27.900 --> 27:34.980
to Ralph and I'd say, Kalissae says that she wouldn't react like this. And he
said, well, we'll work it out tomorrow at our story conference. And we'd sit

27:34.980 --> 27:42.140
there for eight hours trying to hash out dialogue between a character who was
alive in his head and a character who was alive in my head. And he had to have

27:42.140 --> 27:51.520
enough sense of that to go back then and write first draft material based on
what I had told him about a character who was living in my head. The only thing

27:51.520 --> 27:59.700
that saved us was that some character didn't come alive that way for both of us,
right, who then would have been schizophrenic. He'd have been alive one way in

27:59.700 --> 28:04.500
Ralph's head and another way in my head and we'd probably had to, you know, do
something. We'd have to divide him into two characters.
