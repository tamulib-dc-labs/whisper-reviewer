00:11.500 --> 00:18.460
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.460 --> 00:20.680
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:24.020 --> 00:27.180
This is David Cruz and David Carson.

00:31.940 --> 00:36.880
The topic for this show will be the writers of hard science fiction and we will also have an

00:36.880 --> 00:38.820
interview with science fiction author, Hal Clement.

00:40.220 --> 00:44.480
Science, of course, is at the core of science fiction. It's the main point of distinction from

00:44.480 --> 00:49.100
fantasy and other forms of imaginative literature. There have always been science fiction authors

00:49.100 --> 00:53.640
who include science and technology in their stories, of course, but there's only a handful of

00:53.640 --> 00:58.280
writers who demand that a science fiction story have a solid, significant, and accurate scientific

00:58.280 --> 01:03.460
base. These authors form a group writing what many readers call hard science fiction.

01:04.740 --> 01:08.940
Now, hard science fiction is an ambiguous term, but I don't think it's yet been replaced with

01:08.940 --> 01:16.640
anything more useful. We might try to define what we mean precisely by hard science fiction. A lot

01:16.640 --> 01:24.160
of stories deal in psychology or social structures, something like this, whereas a hard science

01:24.160 --> 01:31.440
story, hard science fiction story, would deal basically with the basic sciences first. I think

01:31.440 --> 01:38.420
it would have to deal in astronomy, chemistry, biology, physics, astrophysics, the motion of

01:38.420 --> 01:43.660
planets and stars, and things like this as a base for the story to be built upon.

01:45.020 --> 01:49.100
Yeah, I think a hard science story has to be more than just a gimmick story, where there's some

01:49.100 --> 01:55.120
kind of minor extrapolation or some new weapon or some minor thing that would form the basis of

01:55.120 --> 01:59.620
the story. It has to be the important of the plot. It has to be integral to what's happening in the

01:59.620 --> 02:05.660
story, I think, for it to count as a hard science fiction story. And of course, when you look back

02:05.660 --> 02:10.220
on the history of science fiction, we still have some authors today working who would be, I guess,

02:10.220 --> 02:17.580
from the Golden Age of science fiction writers who have strong scientific backgrounds, Arthur C.

02:17.820 --> 02:23.640
Clark, for instance, Paul Anderson, Isaac Asimov. All of them either have degrees in science or are

02:23.640 --> 02:32.780
highly trained in science. You mentioned Arthur C. Clark. We might note his novels, Fountains of

02:32.780 --> 02:38.340
Paradise, in which he had a geosynchronous satellite connected to the Earth, and rendezvous with

02:38.340 --> 02:45.240
Rama, which deals with an artificial world. Yes, and both Paul Anderson and Isaac Asimov both have

02:45.240 --> 02:51.900
stories which have a good hard science background to them. Asimov, having a degree in biochemistry,

02:52.180 --> 02:57.660
and Anderson having a background in engineering, they both have a rather good scientific background

02:57.660 --> 03:05.520
to build hard science fiction stories around. And then beginning in the early 60s and through most

03:05.520 --> 03:10.060
of that decade, there was a new influence in science fiction, what many critics call the new wave.

03:10.920 --> 03:16.720
And the soft sciences became important at that time, psychology, sociology, things of that sort.

03:16.940 --> 03:22.700
And the emphasis in science fiction came to be placed on character, on character development,

03:23.040 --> 03:28.280
social development, and so forth. In fact, a noted Australian critic of science fiction, George

03:28.280 --> 03:34.100
Turner recently stated this. He said that Clement's mission of gravity may survive on sheer elegance

03:34.100 --> 03:40.080
of conception, but that the scientific expertise required for such work limits proliferation.

03:40.900 --> 03:44.960
The interest of the hard science novel is mainly intellectual, and the form probably

03:44.960 --> 03:51.540
represents a dead end, even though it still survives. And it seems to be surviving rather well. We

03:51.540 --> 03:56.780
have some new authors who have come into the science fiction field, who are writing very good hard

03:56.780 --> 04:01.840
science stories, and they have a good background in science, and they seem to write very intelligent

04:01.840 --> 04:07.700
work, very interesting stories. It would seem like Mr. Turner's quote really is not true, it's just

04:07.700 --> 04:12.120
not coming true. In fact, some of those authors have been winning Hugo's and Nebula's. Joe Halliman

04:12.120 --> 04:17.500
comes to mind. He has a BA in physics and astronomy. He's done postgraduate work in mathematics,

04:18.180 --> 04:24.500
computer science, statistics. He's edited the magazine, Astronomy, and has won both the Hugo

04:24.500 --> 04:30.300
and Nebula for his work, The Forever War, which was based on a very hard scientific concept.

04:31.320 --> 04:36.280
Dr. Jerry Pernell, who has a degree in engineering. He's worked on space research projects. He's

04:36.280 --> 04:41.080
worked on both the Mercury and Apollo projects. He's writing science articles as well as science

04:41.080 --> 04:48.260
fiction. In fact, it's been noted that he writes on the same level as Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov when

04:48.260 --> 04:53.780
it comes to relating scientific concepts to the layman so that he can understand some of the more

04:55.700 --> 04:58.240
intricate interplays in some of the various scientific fields.

04:58.940 --> 05:02.780
Yeah, that's interesting. A lot of these new writers, such as Pornell and so forth,

05:03.520 --> 05:09.240
as Asimov has done, they write science columns for magazines and science fiction books and so

05:09.240 --> 05:14.620
forth, which indicates their interest in that subject. We should also mention John Barley,

05:15.560 --> 05:19.900
a very highly considered science fiction writer who's only, he's written three novels so far,

05:19.960 --> 05:26.280
a number of short stories, but he was trained in physics and in such a novel as Titan and the

05:26.280 --> 05:33.060
sequel to it, Wizards. That training in physics is very evident as he sets up an artificial world

05:33.060 --> 05:37.000
similar to a Dyson sphere and makes it work scientifically, very accurately.

05:37.680 --> 05:42.500
Another person would be James Hogan. All of his novels are extremely scientific.

05:43.480 --> 05:49.640
The one that comes to mind is The Two Faces of Tomorrow with a computer that's very, very believable

05:49.640 --> 05:53.260
because it's so logical and just an extrapolation of what we know now.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.980
Yeah, I like the way in that book too that he'll, in fact, all of his books, he'll get in

05:58.440 --> 06:05.780
all sorts of extrapolation on present technology. For instance, the mass driver he has in that book.

06:06.460 --> 06:09.760
I think that's considered to be possible today. Some of the scientists are looking at.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.540
There are models being built right now that are working mass drivers.

06:14.160 --> 06:22.000
Also, Hogan, we can't neglect his book Thrice Upon a Time. I think it's the only book I can think of

06:22.000 --> 06:27.580
where time travel is made to be, to seem at least, scientifically feasible.

06:28.100 --> 06:33.240
And we certainly need to mention Charles Sheffield. He has a master's in math, a PhD in theoretical

06:33.240 --> 06:37.080
physics, and he's the president of the American Astronautical Society.

06:38.100 --> 06:43.840
Yeah, mostly he's been writing short stories, mostly for analog, but his big novel so far

06:43.840 --> 06:48.420
is The Web Between the Worlds, published a couple of years ago, very highly received by readers.

06:48.960 --> 06:56.280
He's also interested in the L5 Society and space colonies. Some of his work is dealt with the

06:56.800 --> 07:02.200
problems of population on Earth and the possibility that we could build these huge colonies

07:03.040 --> 07:06.660
orbiting the Earth that would allow us to release some of our population pressures.

07:08.180 --> 07:12.100
Probably the most popular of the hard science fiction authors is Hal Clement.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.840
The Science Fiction Radio Show talked with Hal Clement about his work.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.140
You are considered one of the best of the hard science fiction writers.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.220
Why is scientific realism so important in your work?

07:23.180 --> 07:30.020
I'm not sure I'm a good enough psychoanalyst to answer that. I just feel that I have trouble

07:30.020 --> 07:36.400
writing something unless I can more or less convince myself that it might happen. The best

07:36.400 --> 07:44.780
example, I guess, was my attempt a few years ago to write a story for an anthology of vampire tales.

07:45.340 --> 07:49.160
When I had finished it, I discovered that it was a science fiction story.

07:51.200 --> 07:57.400
I counted for everything that happened on a scientific basis, and I wasn't happy about it

07:57.400 --> 08:02.840
until I could account for them that way. Much of your early work was published by John Campbell,

08:02.980 --> 08:06.140
who is noted for his desire for scientific accuracy in the stories he printed.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.180
Did he have much to do with the type of stories that you wrote?

08:10.080 --> 08:16.120
Yes, very certainly it did. John was the one who bought my first several stories.

08:16.840 --> 08:22.600
I knew him quite well, talked to him quite often. Well, I didn't always agree with him. We

08:22.600 --> 08:26.940
both felt that there were rules and that they ought to be followed.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.600
What kind of rules were those?

08:30.180 --> 08:37.160
Well, I mean rules of the universe. We were both materialists, I guess. We felt that the

08:37.160 --> 08:44.420
universe does run by rule, and we felt that a story was most believable when it matched those

08:44.420 --> 08:50.320
rules, at least as we, we meaning humanity in general, currently understood them.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.140
How did you get started writing?

08:52.980 --> 08:58.320
Rather gradually, I was reading the stuff originally and started, I think, with the

08:58.320 --> 09:07.140
Buck Rogers comic strip, and I discovered there were magazines. I began telling the stories that

09:07.140 --> 09:14.220
I'd read in magazines to friends on the great school playground and to boy scouts at campfires.

09:14.900 --> 09:21.400
Then I began correcting some of the errors that I spotted in the stories, and eventually began

09:21.400 --> 09:26.540
trying to write my own. In your novel, Mission of Gravity, it's been noted that you took great

09:26.540 --> 09:31.360
care in designing the world of mescaline. How did you go about designing the world of mescaline?

09:32.360 --> 09:39.740
It was mostly slide rule work. Part of it was my contrary nature. I had read stories in which

09:39.740 --> 09:45.260
planets had extra heavy gravity, stories in which the planets had very light gravity, and

09:45.630 --> 09:51.800
it seemed sort of, of course, there could be no planet with the varying gravity, and I took the,

09:51.940 --> 09:59.540
of course, as a challenge. So I went to work. I am, as I say, a rather firm materialist. I have

09:59.540 --> 10:06.100
serious doubts in things like gravity screens, anti-gravity machines. The only thing I could

10:06.100 --> 10:12.560
think of, which would produce such a variation, was rapid spin. And this was before you could steal

10:12.560 --> 10:19.400
time on computers because they hadn't been invented. I had a good deal of slide rule work, and also

10:19.400 --> 10:25.780
some consultation with such astronomy texts as I could get hold of. And I came up with what seemed

10:25.780 --> 10:31.580
to be a valid planet at the time. There have been errors discovered in it since, I'm afraid.

10:32.680 --> 10:36.060
Does that have reference to the afterward in the book, Mission of Gravity, where you play what

10:36.060 --> 10:42.980
you call the game? Yes. Somebody was playing the game. I believe it was a group of members of the

10:42.980 --> 10:50.360
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Science Fiction Society. It was for short. And they began

10:50.360 --> 10:55.700
taking Mesquite and Apartheid mathematically. I understand from some of them that the planet

10:55.700 --> 11:02.300
actually should come to a sharp edge at the equator instead of a smooth curve. But I am not a good

11:02.300 --> 11:08.500
enough mathematician myself to check up on this point. One particular point about the Mescalonites,

11:09.280 --> 11:13.580
possibly through my own ignorance, I was never able to tell how they conversed with each other.

11:14.180 --> 11:21.180
They used a vocal language sound. They didn't breathe as we did. I tried to account for their

11:21.180 --> 11:28.000
having vocal apparatus by its developing from a swimming siphon analogous to those of our own

11:28.000 --> 11:34.700
squid. Some people say that your alien psychology is too human, and other people say that you create

11:34.700 --> 11:40.040
a very alien psychology for your aliens. How do you go about developing the psychology for your

11:40.040 --> 11:52.500
aliens? Well, I am not sure, first of all, that an intelligent being's psychology would be all

11:52.500 --> 11:58.200
that different from the human one anyway. It is going to depend on the being's motivation. Presumably,

11:58.400 --> 12:05.600
the creature will be driven so as to survive. He or she or it, or they, if they have several

12:05.600 --> 12:13.520
sexes, are going to have drives to find food, to avoid pain. If they do have sexes, they will

12:13.520 --> 12:21.840
be have drives to use them, exercise them, and all of those will tend to provide motivation

12:23.100 --> 12:29.200
recognizably similar to those of humanity. I have a book that's just come out, The Nitrogen

12:29.200 --> 12:37.760
Fix, in which my alien does not have sex, and I spent a good deal of time trying to find

12:38.600 --> 12:45.260
an alternative drive which would be as powerful. I think I found it, but I'm not going to go into

12:45.260 --> 12:51.980
about here. I'd rather you brought the book and decided for yourself. The planning part

12:52.620 --> 13:00.200
depended on that belief, mostly. I felt that the drives could be at least understood by a human

13:00.200 --> 13:09.280
being. For those people who say that my aliens are noticeably alien, not human in psychology,

13:09.640 --> 13:18.360
I'm afraid I have a rather cynical answer. My secret for making a being seem non-human is to

13:18.360 --> 13:26.080
make him act rationally. For example, I can be fairly specific about this one, in the sequel to

13:26.080 --> 13:32.420
Mission of Gravity, Starlight. At one point I had one of my master knights driving one of these

13:32.420 --> 13:40.480
giant tanks along completely unknown territory, and nothing was happening. He wanted to get

13:40.480 --> 13:47.240
somewhere, and he gradually began going a little faster, and little faster as a human being would do.

13:48.360 --> 13:53.660
Then he suddenly realized what he was doing and slowed down again, which is of course the rational

13:53.660 --> 13:59.180
thing to do. My own suspicion is that nine human beings out of ten would not have slowed down until

13:59.180 --> 14:04.160
they'd run into something. What caused you to write the sequels to both Mission of Gravity and Needle?

14:04.760 --> 14:11.640
In a sense, I was talked into it. I'm very uneasy about sequels and series stories in general. My

14:11.640 --> 14:17.580
experience has been reading them, but I was always disappointed by the later ones. I formed my

14:17.580 --> 14:22.860
opinion of what things were like, and the later stories usually changed those opinions and

14:22.860 --> 14:31.300
disappointed me. The Mission of Gravity sequel came as a result of a conversation I think at one of

14:31.300 --> 14:38.760
the New York conventions, a fan said something, and I can't now remember exactly what it was,

14:38.760 --> 14:45.760
which sounded like a good idea to use the master knights, and I built it up from there. I can be

14:45.760 --> 14:53.980
much more specific about the Needle sequel. There was one particular science fiction fan who was

14:53.980 --> 14:59.460
always asking me when it was going to come out. Every time I met him at a convention, when is the

14:59.460 --> 15:06.300
Needle sequel coming? How? Finally, he changed his tactic. One fine day at a Philadelphia convention,

15:06.940 --> 15:13.240
he walked up to me and said, how? You promised if I stopped smoking, you would write a sequel to

15:13.240 --> 15:19.760
Needle. I've stopped, get at it. Well, I had no recollection of ever making such a deal, but I

15:19.760 --> 15:29.160
couldn't spoil any such success story, so I got to work on it. Not very fast, but I got a little done.

15:29.440 --> 15:34.040
Then I was telling this same story at another convention, I think at Toronto two or three years

15:34.040 --> 15:40.800
later, and Judy Lynn Delray of Delray Books overheard me, and the next thing I knew I had signed a contract.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.120
So he got what he wanted anyway.

15:54.740 --> 15:58.780
There was sort of a tongue-in-cheek style to your short story, The Critical Factor,

15:59.120 --> 16:03.520
where there are beings living in the earth beneath us who are just as unaware of us as we are

16:03.520 --> 16:08.640
unaware of them. What type of psychology and physiology did you develop for creatures that

16:08.640 --> 16:15.420
could flow through solid rock? It was written long enough ago now, so I'm afraid I don't recall all

16:15.420 --> 16:25.680
the details of what led up to it. The idea of having creatures not understanding or not being

16:25.680 --> 16:32.620
aware of others has been part of my basic science fiction frame for a long time, and I think it's

16:32.620 --> 16:37.980
a very likely sort of thing, though I don't like to go into anything as extreme as the fourth dimension.

16:39.280 --> 16:46.140
The idea of something which could soak through rock, well, I have had courses in things like

16:46.140 --> 16:51.560
seismology, although I never specialized in any of the geological sciences. I know a reasonable

16:51.560 --> 16:59.240
amount of chemistry, and this just seemed like a perfectly possible situation to me, and it was fun

16:59.240 --> 17:05.960
figuring out what would happen when a creature like this encountered an open space where gravity

17:05.960 --> 17:10.960
could take over, meaning a creature like that had never felt the force of gravity before. Right,

17:12.140 --> 17:17.100
which of course a fish wouldn't have either, and I may possibly have considered intelligent

17:17.100 --> 17:22.060
fish when I was planning that story, but as I say, it was so long ago now I don't really remember.

17:22.060 --> 17:27.860
This was 27 years ago, I don't recall. You wrote most of your short stories early on, didn't you?

17:29.960 --> 17:36.960
Yes, it's been a hobby all along, and in the last few years there somehow seems to have been less

17:36.960 --> 17:42.060
and less time. I've been doing more work connected with my profession of high school science teaching.

17:42.700 --> 17:47.360
I'm currently president-elect of the Knowing and Association of Chemistry Teachers, and I have an

17:47.360 --> 17:50.780
awful feeling that's going to take a lot of my time for the next two and a half years.

17:51.380 --> 17:55.960
Yes, it sounds like that might take up a lot of your time. I find Needle one of your most

17:55.960 --> 18:02.120
fascinating books. It's been said by whom I don't know that a good science fiction mystery could not

18:02.120 --> 18:07.740
be written. John Campbell used to make that claim, and I suspect that Needle was written at least

18:07.740 --> 18:15.720
partly to try to prove John wrong. When it was coming out as a cereal, he made one of his trips

18:15.720 --> 18:23.700
to the Greater Boston area. The first of the two parts of the cereal was on the stands then,

18:24.220 --> 18:31.620
and he began to talk about it to an MIT audience, got a loud scream of, don't give the solution away.

18:32.140 --> 18:37.480
He admitted that he was wrong about science fiction mysteries not being possible.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.720
The detective in the Needle is a symbiot living in its host body.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.800
Where did you come up with that, dear? It's really a unique idea.

18:44.800 --> 18:51.700
Well, the idea is really not very new. The basic notion of what you might call possession has been

18:51.700 --> 18:59.480
part of the human mythology probably since long before we learned to write, and many science

18:59.480 --> 19:06.000
fiction stories prior to Needle had had this, that, or the other sort of creature entering the human

19:06.000 --> 19:13.340
body and doing various things. The one I can remember most vividly was by Nathan Shockner,

19:13.340 --> 19:21.520
two-part cereal called Infra Universe, which appeared in the December 1936, January 1937,

19:21.640 --> 19:26.940
issues of astounding stories. One reason that I, that good in the memory is I have the December

19:26.940 --> 19:32.200
36 astounding open in front of me at the moment. At the moment, I've been reading old collection

19:32.200 --> 19:40.800
stuff, and that had virus-like creatures moving into the human body and taking control. Again,

19:40.800 --> 19:47.020
I was more materialistic. I didn't think that such a creature could take over as easily as was

19:47.020 --> 19:52.040
suggested in some of these stories, and I felt that the hunter would have to have to do quite a

19:52.040 --> 19:58.320
job of work before he had any real effect of communication to say nothing of control in his

19:58.320 --> 20:02.820
host. Yes, and all the time I was reading the Needle, I was wondering why doesn't he vibrate

20:02.820 --> 20:08.420
his ear, and then that's what you have him do in the sequel. Eventually, yes, the idea has worked out.

20:10.420 --> 20:14.040
Well, I have to admit that that idea didn't occur to me until later.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.480
I will just have to admit that it didn't occur to the hunter either.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.100
Yes, well, both you and the hunter probably think along the same lines.

20:21.520 --> 20:31.940
Yes, I'm not the sort of craftsman who can come up with a personality totally different from my own

20:31.940 --> 20:36.960
and make it sound believable. There are people who are much better at that art than I am.

20:37.860 --> 20:44.960
Robert Heinlein, for example, can write Stranger in a Strange Land, become practically a god to the

20:44.960 --> 20:51.520
hippies, and then write Starship Trooper and have everybody thinking he's a Nazi. And this,

20:51.680 --> 20:58.060
in my opinion, neither of them reflects his own beliefs, he simply shows his skill at the character

20:58.060 --> 21:05.160
portrayal. I can't do that. I can't come close to it. No, but you do have some of the best aliens

21:05.160 --> 21:08.800
I've ever read. Do you have any authors that you think put together good aliens?

21:09.720 --> 21:16.820
Well, my favorite, I think, is Paul Anderson. He's done a good deal of this sort of thing, too. We have

21:17.920 --> 21:25.880
worked together to a certain extent. We collaborated by mail in putting together the planetary system

21:25.880 --> 21:31.980
in which his novel Fire Time took place. I supposedly have rights to a few planets in the

21:31.980 --> 21:36.640
same system, and if time ever permits, I may write some stories about them.

21:38.100 --> 21:42.480
Aside from aliens in particular, do you have any authors whom you think are writing good, hard

21:42.480 --> 21:50.400
science? Well, Paul still comes to mind, first of all. Arthur Clark, of course, knows his

21:50.940 --> 21:55.760
relevant space science very thoroughly, and he doesn't do silly things like having spaceships

21:55.760 --> 22:01.300
fall into the sun when their engines quit. Isaac Asimov, although he doesn't write very much

22:01.300 --> 22:09.440
science fiction now, seldom makes really serious science mistakes in it. A lot of the new writers,

22:09.740 --> 22:16.460
I'm sorry to say, I can't cite my name. Several of them are pretty good, but my memory for names

22:16.460 --> 22:20.620
is terrible, and it's the start of the school year, and I'm currently trying to learn the names

22:20.620 --> 22:27.320
of about 75 students of my own. Back to the subject of aliens again, do you think anybody's ever put

22:27.320 --> 22:35.040
together a good alien for the movies? I haven't seen by any means all of the movie science fiction

22:35.040 --> 22:46.300
things. The one that was called alien, I gather, was very impressive, but was so mostly by avoiding

22:46.300 --> 22:53.800
detailed portrayal of his or its or her nature, which of course is a perfectly good trick.

22:54.680 --> 23:04.900
I can't think of any alien I have seen in a movie who was really believable in character,

23:05.080 --> 23:11.020
believably alien. Now, what was his name, Yoder, or something like that, and the empire strikes back,

23:11.140 --> 23:17.200
was funny and good as far as, I guess, as he went. Who else?

23:19.180 --> 23:26.940
Now, that's pretty well. That's the only one I can think of who was very impressive. There were

23:26.940 --> 23:39.600
several unnamed species in the bar scene in the first of the shows, the Star Wars, where

23:40.160 --> 23:49.160
the disguise was good, the arguing back and forth in a completely unintelligible language

23:49.840 --> 23:56.680
produced a very impressive and funny scene. But again, you can't really tell what the personalities

23:56.680 --> 24:02.900
of the creatures were like. They're very much like drunks in a terrestrial bar. I think a good

24:02.900 --> 24:07.900
job was done, but I wouldn't say they were really alien. And what do you, I don't know,

24:07.980 --> 24:20.960
what can be done? The movie, the visual field, either movies or TV, represents quite a different

24:20.960 --> 24:27.880
problem from the writing one. And I know just enough about it to realize what the difference is.

24:27.880 --> 24:32.360
I would question my own ability to write a good TV script or a movie script,

24:33.240 --> 24:42.520
because you are depending a great deal on what the customer sees, rather than on the words you can

24:43.240 --> 24:50.280
use, the paragraphs you can build to explain what the background situation is. I don't know how that

24:50.280 --> 24:56.980
problem is solved, really. Possibly with a lot of money. Well, that certainly helped.

24:58.320 --> 25:03.900
But I don't think money is the whole answer to a problem like that. You need somebody who

25:05.040 --> 25:11.940
has not merely an imagination, but a skill in the field. He has to have experience. He has to

25:12.680 --> 25:19.960
have knowledge, which I think probably can only come from experience, of what those visual

25:19.960 --> 25:30.260
media can and can't do, and in what ways practically they differ from the written word. And here I'm

25:30.260 --> 25:36.340
quite aware of my own limitations, and I shouldn't even try to tell what those differences are,

25:36.380 --> 25:41.540
because most of them I probably don't even recognize. Yes, I see what you mean now.

25:42.320 --> 25:48.440
In your current book, The Nitrogen Fix, how did you come up with the idea about the oxygen being

25:49.060 --> 25:54.340
gone from the Earth's atmosphere, or at least bonded with nitrogen? That's right. The idea itself

25:54.340 --> 26:01.360
is not no. It was used many years ago in a story called The Mightiest Machine by John Campbell,

26:01.680 --> 26:08.740
which someone invented a catalyst which permitted the direct combination of nitrogen and oxygen to

26:08.740 --> 26:15.220
nitrogen and dioxide. Actually, such a catalyst wouldn't work, apparently.

26:15.220 --> 26:19.360
Nearly as I've been able to figure out from the available free energies concerned.

26:19.800 --> 26:25.880
But with a little juggling and having life forms involved, which can balance off the

26:27.200 --> 26:31.660
decrease in free, the increase in free energy in one place with a decrease in another,

26:32.220 --> 26:39.220
it seemed possible to me. Also, again, I was more careful quantitatively that John was. He had the

26:39.220 --> 26:45.660
snowflakes of nitrogen and dioxide drifting out of the sky and bursting into flame as they hit

26:45.660 --> 26:52.740
organic matter and oxidized it. The red-brown gases that rose when the high oxides of nitrogen got

26:52.740 --> 27:00.480
reduced by other things like organics and the streams fuming as the oxides of nitrogen

27:01.140 --> 27:04.560
boiled into them. There's a very impressive book, beautiful adventure story,

27:04.560 --> 27:09.160
but unfortunately there isn't that much oxygen in the air as in the atmosphere. You couldn't have

27:09.160 --> 27:16.200
made that much nitrogen and dioxide. And I had to tone everything down a good deal and have the

27:16.200 --> 27:21.240
worst of it have happened in the past and try to figure out what the final results would have been,

27:21.280 --> 27:25.200
or intermediate results anyway, a couple of thousand years after things had started.

27:26.220 --> 27:31.860
But I'd been working on that quantitatively for a long time because I can remember giving a talk

27:31.860 --> 27:38.500
on the general subject to a local college somewhere about the winter of 1958-59.

27:39.340 --> 27:42.960
Oh, I see. You've been working on the basic outline of this book for a long time.

27:43.320 --> 27:43.980
Yes, indeed.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.520
Are you working on anything new right now?

27:46.960 --> 27:53.380
Only in the sense that whenever I think of some idea which might be useful, I stick it on a three

27:53.380 --> 27:59.260
by five card and put it where I can find it again. When the pile of cards gets high enough,

27:59.260 --> 28:04.260
I start spreading it out and seeing if they can be put into any sort of rational sequence.

28:04.880 --> 28:09.980
School has just started in the last couple of weeks and I really haven't time to do very much

28:09.980 --> 28:15.380
of that for a while. Won't have for a few months. I won't have time. Well, Christmas vacation will

28:15.380 --> 28:17.160
be the first time I can do very much on that line.

28:31.600 --> 28:36.940
The works of Hal Clement and others who write hard science fiction are truer to the appellation

28:36.940 --> 28:42.620
science fiction than many others who write in the genre. Fiction that is not said in either our

28:42.620 --> 28:48.440
present or the known past can easily become unrealistic. But with the governing effect of

28:48.440 --> 28:52.460
scientific background, the fantasies of the future are given plausibility.

28:53.240 --> 28:58.660
Perhaps this combination of fantasy and plausibility is what draws so many humans

28:58.660 --> 29:01.440
to the imperian realms of science fiction.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.300
This is David Cruz.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.180
And David Carson.

29:13.540 --> 29:18.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

29:18.900 --> 29:24.740
Association in conjunction with KOCV FM and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
