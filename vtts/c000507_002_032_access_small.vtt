Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.800
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.100
And here are your hosts.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.060
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

00:46.440 --> 00:50.600
Philip Jose Farmer has been a mainstay science fiction writer since 1952.

00:51.140 --> 00:55.540
He has written over 40 novels and over 80 short stories focusing on a wide variety of

00:55.540 --> 00:55.920
subjects.

00:56.520 --> 01:01.980
These range from Tarzan to the afterlife, from sex-crazed aliens to a star-faring Catholic

01:01.980 --> 01:02.400
priest.

01:02.920 --> 01:07.380
Farmer's most famous works are the River World series, The World of Tears series, his

01:07.380 --> 01:10.980
erotic fantasy novels, and the story, later a novel, The Lovers.

01:11.460 --> 01:13.740
We asked Farmer how he started writing science fiction.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.120
I started reading science fiction when I was seven years old.

01:18.380 --> 01:19.740
I'm 63 now.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.660
And I knew I always wanted to be a writer.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.540
Although I didn't do much about it for many years.

01:28.820 --> 01:34.540
The funny thing is I actually intended to become a mainstream writer, that is, to write

01:35.320 --> 01:37.920
stories which are not in particular genre.

01:38.900 --> 01:45.040
But I somehow or other just drifted into science fiction and sold my first science fiction

01:45.040 --> 01:46.400
story in 1952.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.740
That was called The Lovers.

01:49.000 --> 01:56.900
It was a novel that was published in a magazine, and it's generally credited with breaking

01:58.500 --> 02:02.100
taboos against the mature use of sex in science fiction magazines.

02:03.480 --> 02:07.700
We asked Farmer if he consciously set out to break taboos by writing The Lovers.

02:08.880 --> 02:14.780
No, I had an idea for a story, and I couldn't write it unless I broke the taboos.

02:14.860 --> 02:21.140
I didn't really consciously set out to do it because I had the idea, and I thought it

02:21.140 --> 02:21.480
was terrific.

02:21.480 --> 02:25.860
On the other hand, I knew I was going to have a lot of trouble getting accepted, and I did.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.740
I did have a lot of trouble.

02:30.720 --> 02:37.180
The first editor I sent it to, John Campbell, who was the editor of The Stounding, was the

02:37.180 --> 02:39.120
most prestigious and highest paying market.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.940
Naturally, I sent it to him first.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.580
And he returned it with a comment that I'm not a editor.

02:46.420 --> 02:53.000
I sent it to Horace Gold, who was editing Galaxy, which was equally prestigious and had

02:53.000 --> 02:54.980
about the same word rates.

02:55.780 --> 02:58.860
His comments were something like John Campbell's.

02:59.880 --> 03:06.440
Then I sent it to Samuel Mayn, who was editor of a magazine called Starling Stories.

03:06.440 --> 03:13.600
And he immediately accepted it and knew it was a revolutionary breakthrough.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.480
He published it and I was on my way.

03:19.060 --> 03:25.640
Accepted the next story I wrote was also equally revolutionary, and it took me a year before

03:25.640 --> 03:28.040
I could get anybody to accept it.

03:30.280 --> 03:34.780
Farmer is also interested in religion in its varied forms and has used it in his works.

03:35.900 --> 03:39.400
My interest in religion has manifested itself throughout all my work.

03:41.520 --> 03:46.540
Although a lot of people, when they say the name Farmer, immediately think of sex in both.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.400
Fact is I've written much more about religion than about sex.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.160
Or sometimes both at the same time.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.280
Some in some respects.

03:58.860 --> 04:01.900
Second religion are two sides of the same coin.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.280
In certain fields of activity.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.040
But religion is only one of many themes.

04:14.500 --> 04:19.160
Farmer feels that he may have labored in relative anonymity for years because his writings are so varied,

04:19.160 --> 04:20.660
but he has his reasons.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.180
Tomorrow we continue with more on Philip Jose Farmer.

05:53.620 --> 05:57.800
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.720 --> 06:17.940
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.280
And here are your hosts.

06:27.060 --> 06:29.480
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.240
We're continuing our interview with Philip Jose Farmer.

06:32.660 --> 06:36.980
We want to explore here some background related to one of Farmer's major themes, religion.

06:37.700 --> 06:43.400
As Farmer allowed earlier, he considers himself a writer of religious themes even more so than a writer of sexual themes.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.980
His own religious background is quite checkered.

06:45.980 --> 06:52.840
I was sent to Sunday school when I was very little and I became interested in the Bible and I read it on my own.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.660
And I even read the Book of Mormon, which was about nine years old.

06:57.960 --> 07:09.240
And I always wrestled all my life with the problems of immortality, predestination, grace, gastro-life and all that sort of stuff.

07:09.240 --> 07:17.320
I was raised as a Christian scientist until the time I was about twelve.

07:18.620 --> 07:30.500
And then I was sent to a Presbyterian church where there was a conflict between Christian science and the Presbyterian idea of predestination.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.720
And then when I was about sixteen, I guess I became an atheist.

07:36.180 --> 07:43.960
Now I've gone through atheism, through agnosticism, and then I was converted to the disciples of Christ.

07:45.520 --> 07:52.140
And then I backslid, gone from grace, as the theological term goes.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.800
And then I lapsed back into agnosticism.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.400
And what are Farmer's present beliefs?

07:59.400 --> 08:05.100
My present situation is that without immortality life has no meaning.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.780
If there's a creation there must be a creator.

08:09.680 --> 08:16.980
But I've come tremendously interested in what is sometimes referred to as myth.

08:16.980 --> 08:24.280
And it isn't really like the Muslims, the Muslims Sufism school.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.560
Then a lot of related stuff like that.

08:31.600 --> 08:37.740
You might see right now I'm in a sort of limbo heading towards something I don't know what.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.740
The concept of an afterlife appears repeatedly in Farmer's works.

08:41.740 --> 08:48.520
Well, if you think about it, there could be a million different possibilities in an afterlife of their work.

08:49.520 --> 09:00.340
But one of my perhaps unstated themes is that immortality may not depend upon a supernatural being.

09:02.380 --> 09:08.720
It's in the evolutionary drive of man for him to invent immortality himself.

09:10.880 --> 09:15.860
Well, the drawback to that is those people who are already dead will remain dead, right?

09:16.240 --> 09:26.760
That doesn't correspond to the religious idea of immortality where everybody is raised from the first human being to the last one.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.480
I like to do a lot of variations on that.

09:30.920 --> 09:34.880
I have a new book called The Unraising Mask.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.900
That's the quotation from Moby Dick.

09:37.780 --> 09:45.520
And this is concerned with theology, afterlife, immortality.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.300
You might call it a philosophical, theological space opera.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.820
Many of Farmer's first works had the central theme of religion.

10:10.440 --> 10:16.100
The lovers and a woman a day deal with a future amalgamation of church and state called the Sturge.

10:16.320 --> 10:22.280
A popular character, Father John Carmody, is a planet hopping Catholic priest who has appeared in several short stories.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.900
We learn about his former life and conversion in the excellent novel Night of Light.

10:27.620 --> 10:31.400
Inside, Outside is a wild tale about the afterlife and immortality.

10:31.840 --> 10:36.900
It is in fact the predecessor to the famous River World series, which we will discuss in our next show.

10:56.900 --> 11:26.880
The Unraising Mask

11:35.320 --> 11:39.300
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:54.560 --> 11:59.880
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.180
And here are your hosts.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.280
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.140
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

12:11.660 --> 12:17.840
Having looked into Philip Jose Farmer's feelings on religion and immortality, we began a look today at the River World series.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.440
Farmer explains the basis of the story.

12:44.360 --> 12:55.940
The main mystery behind the whole thing was why were all these people resurrected? Who did it and how?

12:57.040 --> 13:03.420
But the River World concept is so big that Farmer's managed only to scratch the surface in the four main novels of the series.

13:03.420 --> 13:15.480
There are so many themes that I wanted to explore during the course of those four novels, but I couldn't do it because I would have slowed the story down too much.

13:16.360 --> 13:22.640
It wasn't taking too many sidetracks, you might say, and I'd still be working on that particular series.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.760
What else is left? Listen to Farmer as he gives us an inkling of what he would like to cover.

13:28.760 --> 13:36.640
I didn't go into any detail on how you could work out viable societies with people from every place and every time.

13:37.840 --> 13:47.220
I also wanted to bring up in depth what would happen to famous people on that planet.

13:49.400 --> 13:59.360
Carl Marx, for instance, what would he think of what happened to his ideas about communism on the planet Earth after he died?

14:01.420 --> 14:12.560
Leonardo da Vinci, his ideas about art, plus the fact that he's on a planet where there are very few pigments available, for instance, for him to paint.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.560
What would he do there?

14:17.480 --> 14:29.100
I also wanted to bring up various figures from science and the military and philosophy and so forth, show what they would do there.

14:29.620 --> 14:41.940
One of the things about the river world was that although you were resurrected there in a useful body of your own, as it was in 25, or earlier, if you died before 25,

14:44.660 --> 14:52.100
if, for instance, you were 83 when you died and when your mind is still 83 and you have 83 years of experience on Earth behind you,

14:54.860 --> 15:04.740
no, is your character formed? Are you going to go through perhaps a thousand years being the same person? Or are you going to improve?

15:05.520 --> 15:08.420
And is the magic labyrinth the last word on the river world?

15:09.220 --> 15:18.920
I made a lot of people mad at me. Because of that last sentence or your paragraph, I should say, I wrote in the magic labyrinth.

15:18.920 --> 15:33.180
Everything seems to have been settled. Everything has been cleared up. And then one of the characters, the kind of minor one, Peter J. Striggett,

15:33.460 --> 15:39.860
he's celebrating with the others in the misty tar when he thinks he hears a football outside in the hallway,

15:41.300 --> 15:46.900
goes out, comes back, and says to the others, I didn't see anyone. It must have been my imagination.

15:47.660 --> 15:53.060
A lot of readers got mad at me because they thought, oh no, he's going to write another one. He's leaving a loophole.

15:53.140 --> 15:57.360
Well, I am leaving a loophole. I don't know whether I'll go through it or not.

15:57.360 --> 16:05.660
But it's quite possible that the magic labyrinth wasn't the final one in that series before.

16:05.980 --> 16:15.320
That everything that our protagonist learns and everybody else learns is quickly untrue or half-true.

16:16.240 --> 16:22.120
So the river world novels may or may not be finished, but we do have some more side stream stories to anticipate.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.660
More on Farmer tomorrow.

16:31.180 --> 16:36.540
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:36.800 --> 16:39.700
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.340
The Science Fiction Radio Show

17:27.340 --> 17:29.000
So stay with us.

17:44.380 --> 17:49.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.980
And here are your hosts.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.180
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.800
Our show today continues the discussion with Philip Jose Farmer.

18:05.160 --> 18:11.120
A major incident in Farmer's career began when Venus on the Half Shell, a novel written under the pseudonym Kilgore Trout,

18:11.520 --> 18:15.680
appeared in the pages of fantasy and science fiction in late 74, early 75.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.220
Of course, Kilgore Trout is the creation of author Kurt Vonnegut Jr.

18:19.840 --> 18:25.380
The character Trout is an impoverished, underappreciated science fiction writer who appears in a number of Vonnegut's novels.

18:25.380 --> 18:28.360
We asked Farmer if he identifies with Kilgore Trout.

18:55.520 --> 19:00.480
We're being taken due to our inexperience with various publishers and agents.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.840
Also, I had a tough time getting any recognition.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.100
So I guess that's why I identified with him.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.840
Most of the fact is he's a great character.

19:12.360 --> 19:17.180
Vonnegut did not appreciate the reviews given Venus on the Half Shell, either pro or con,

19:17.360 --> 19:20.840
because most of the reviewers approached the work as if Vonnegut were the author.

19:20.840 --> 19:25.560
This cost Farmer the opportunity to write another novel under the Kilgore Trout pseudonym.

19:51.100 --> 19:56.420
When I applied for permission to write The Son of Jimmy Valentine, which I really would have loved to,

19:56.660 --> 20:03.000
I could have had a lot of fun with it, he said no, which is his prerogative.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.660
We asked if The Son of Jimmy Valentine was Kilgore Trout's one erotic novel.

20:10.140 --> 20:18.220
It was not only his one and only specifically erotic book, it was also his only non-science fiction book.

20:19.220 --> 20:25.320
Farmer obviously enjoys writing about fictional authors who in turn write about their own fictional authors and so on.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.660
Listen as he describes what writing as Kilgore Trout started.

20:29.500 --> 20:38.100
In the Venus on the Half Shell, the protagonist, Simon Lagstaff, had his favorite science fiction author.

20:38.900 --> 20:45.000
Just as in Vonnegut's books, Elliott Rose Water lost the Kilgore Trout,

20:45.100 --> 20:48.520
the greatest living writer in any field.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.120
He should have been president of the US, he couldn't have solved all the problems.

20:51.940 --> 21:02.280
Well anyway, in Venus on the Half Shell, Simon Lagstaff liked to read the science fiction works of a fellow called Jonathan Swiss Summers the Third.

21:03.060 --> 21:08.380
And I describe his various works as a Ralf item and give the titles.

21:09.640 --> 21:23.460
But Jonathan Swiss Summers, who's a fictional author, wrote about a giant German shepherd police dog whose IQ had been raised to about 200 in a laboratory and he became a private detective.

21:24.580 --> 21:34.900
Now, I plan eventually on writing a book by Ralf von Baubau, this dog, under the name Ralf von Baubau.

21:36.520 --> 21:48.760
And then maybe I'll end the cycle by having Ralf von Baubau write about a human named Vonnegut or something like that and completing it, going right back to Vonnegut again.

21:49.900 --> 21:58.020
Farmer conceded with the extended family group called the Vold Newton family in which many great historical and fictional characters are descended from the scarlet Pimpernel.

21:58.680 --> 22:04.620
Thus Kilgore Trout is related to Sherlock Holmes, Doc Savage, Sam Spade and James Bond among others.

22:05.260 --> 22:08.180
We will look into this aspect of Farmer's writing some more tomorrow.

22:14.920 --> 22:24.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:08.180 --> 23:12.000
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:27.260 --> 23:32.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:32.540 --> 23:36.840
And here are your hosts.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.960
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.340
This show will conclude our interview with Philip Jose Farmer.

23:47.920 --> 23:54.280
Yesterday we discussed Farmer's pension for writing under pseudonyms, as it turns out this practice has a very desirable side effect.

23:55.460 --> 24:04.100
One of the funny things about this is that I found out that I could use the fictional author device to break a writing block.

24:04.380 --> 24:10.480
I had a writing block once, that terrible thing that sometimes happens to writers.

24:11.780 --> 24:14.480
They don't know what caused this for some reason.

24:15.220 --> 24:19.820
They might have many ideas, be eager to go, but when they sit down in front of a typewriter nothing happens.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.540
Well, that happened to me once.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.160
I never thought it would. I thought it was immune to such a thing.

24:27.820 --> 24:28.300
But it did.

24:29.240 --> 24:33.800
And after a wrestling for two months and getting no place, I had an idea.

24:35.460 --> 24:45.280
I sat down with the typewriter and wrote a story, not by Philip Jose Farmer, but by David Copperfield, I'd say.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.760
I don't remember which particular nominative.

24:49.920 --> 24:55.980
The story poured out. Very good. I thought so anyway.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.480
When I'd completed that, the writing block was gone.

25:01.020 --> 25:06.600
See, I wasn't writing then as me, or Philip Jose Farmer, but as a Gilbert Trout.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.380
And I was in his shoes. I had no trouble.

25:10.380 --> 25:18.540
The funny thing about this is, it's a psychological trick that I'm conscious of.

25:21.060 --> 25:22.440
And yet it works.

25:24.300 --> 25:29.020
It's not like I'm trying to trick my unconscious, but I must be doing it one way or another.

25:31.940 --> 25:37.900
I don't know if anybody else has ever broken a writer's block in that manner, but I recommend trying it.

25:39.180 --> 25:43.840
Farmer has also written several books featuring Tarzan or Tarzan-like characters.

25:44.420 --> 25:46.420
Tarzan Alive is Tarzan's biography.

25:47.100 --> 25:52.260
The erotic novel A Feast Unknown and its clean sequels The Mad Goblin and Lord of the Trees

25:52.260 --> 25:55.680
feature thinly veiled versions of Tarzan and Doc Savage.

25:56.220 --> 26:02.300
Lord Tiger, the Opar books, and the Adventures of the Peerless Peer also have Tarzan-like protagonists.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.480
We asked Farmer when he developed his interest in Tarzan.

26:06.360 --> 26:14.660
I first read Tarzan when I guess I was about seven or eight years old, and I became wrapped up in that early age with the words of,

26:14.660 --> 26:17.480
like your eyes swirls.

26:19.220 --> 26:24.360
But when I started college, I kind of lost interest and didn't read him anymore.

26:29.980 --> 26:34.780
But later Farmer picked up on Tarzan again. This time he saw Tarzan in a different light.

26:35.920 --> 26:48.800
When I started reading the books about Tarzan again, and this time, although I still kept a lot of my childhood interest in him,

26:50.300 --> 26:55.240
I began seeing things in Tarzan, for instance, that had not been seen before.

26:56.760 --> 27:06.240
It was not just a child who'd been cast away and raised by great apes and then become a creature of the jungle,

27:06.240 --> 27:18.180
then returned to claim his fortune. He was sort of an archetype of many, many heroes from classical myth.

27:19.420 --> 27:24.060
And now I'm sure that when Burroughs wrote this, he didn't know what he was doing, but he did it unconsciously.

27:24.680 --> 27:27.600
I think it's the creation of Tarzan and the Stroke of Genius.

27:28.540 --> 27:34.800
Burroughs is not a great writer, but he has created a great character just like Aikon and Doyle.

27:35.340 --> 27:39.960
He created a great character, Sherlock Holmes.

27:41.060 --> 27:48.760
Philip Jose Farmer, an author with a seemingly endless supply of unique ideas who appears just now to be gaining widespread acceptance.

27:55.820 --> 28:01.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:02.040 --> 28:04.920
