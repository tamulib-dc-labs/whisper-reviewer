00:08.740 --> 00:12.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.380 --> 00:33.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.140 --> 00:38.020
And here are your hosts.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.360
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.660 --> 00:47.520
Harry Harrison is one of the pioneers of adventure science fiction.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.280
His death row trilogy, written in the 1960s, is a prime example.

00:51.840 --> 00:56.440
Recently Harrison completed another adventure series entitled To The Stars, a trilogy comprising

00:56.440 --> 00:58.260
Homeworld, Wheelworld and Starworld.

00:58.380 --> 01:02.480
In Homeworld we find a 500 year distant Britain under the heels of a strong government.

01:02.900 --> 01:07.540
In Wheelworld we find a planet whose harsh conditions are reminiscent of earlier Harrison novels.

01:07.980 --> 01:11.320
In the final novel Starworld we find America 500 years from now.

01:11.540 --> 01:15.040
As it turns out Harrison wrote the middle installment, Wheelworld, first.

01:15.660 --> 01:21.180
The trilogy came about through the inability I have to just take the situation as set.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.340
I know what I got the idea from when I was in California on the freeway with my friend

01:26.340 --> 01:27.020
Brian Aldous.

01:27.380 --> 01:30.840
We were in a horrible little English sprite which was about 8 inches high and 2 feet wide

01:30.840 --> 01:33.140
and it goes a maximum of 50 miles an hour.

01:33.540 --> 01:39.220
And we're turning along five lane freeway, California 5, great big articulated trucks

01:39.220 --> 01:41.740
with trails going by with 14 foot high wheels.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.220
I'm looking at the bottom of hubcaps, you know, trying to keep this thing going straight.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.920
And God I had a vision at that point of a world where trucks ran forever on and on and

01:50.920 --> 01:52.060
on, through and around the whole planet.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.580
I said, how can we do that?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.920
So I had to develop a whole plant and a culture to get them there.

01:57.260 --> 02:00.620
And by the time I'd done it and written the book, they had to say, I feel it's incomplete.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.780
How did they get there in the first place?

02:03.100 --> 02:04.540
And what happened to that revolution afterwards?

02:04.720 --> 02:06.500
And I said, you're right, I've got so much plotting in here.

02:06.980 --> 02:08.700
I have a whole book before and a book afterwards.

02:09.320 --> 02:13.540
So I took the character, he'd ride this plant for nameless reasons and it ended with the

02:13.540 --> 02:14.940
revolution which is going wrong.

02:15.380 --> 02:19.540
So I went back and told you how he got there, which took on earth and I closed the book

02:19.540 --> 02:20.540
together in the final one.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.360
They came out different, the one middle one was written first.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.340
They had to be a different aspect, you know, then the third one of course put the first

02:27.340 --> 02:27.840
two together.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.420
Harrison was able to assemble a number of his plot devices in this series and there

02:32.420 --> 02:34.160
was a message as is usual for Harrison.

02:34.920 --> 02:39.520
I use different things at different times and they're high technology and enjoyment

02:39.520 --> 02:44.560
of technology and a little bit of politics and the first one is some ways like a make-room,

02:44.680 --> 02:48.500
make-room and so where are we going to go if we don't get a hold of technology and what

02:48.500 --> 02:49.180
we can do.

02:49.660 --> 02:55.980
If you notice there's a very, the first book shows you how rotten Britain will be five

02:55.980 --> 02:59.920
hundred years from now, the third book, how rotten America will be five hundred years

02:59.920 --> 03:05.580
from now and all done for good intentions with lack of knowledge of how to go about

03:05.580 --> 03:08.620
taking care of helping people and they're both rotten worlds.

03:09.140 --> 03:11.000
So there again the admonitory thing is being shaken.

03:11.320 --> 03:16.540
No, this is you, you must get technologies involved, you must do somehow, not guess,

03:16.540 --> 03:19.580
you must just somehow do a better job of ruling the world, you know.

03:20.140 --> 03:25.860
We're in a technological world and nobody in the British Parliament or the American Senate

03:25.860 --> 03:27.960
or legislation knows anything about science.

03:28.800 --> 03:35.520
I mean we, a bunch of ex-lawyers and politicians, politicians have one motivation life, that's

03:35.520 --> 03:36.320
to get reelected.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.880
Look at the whole mix and trouble came about because all he wanted to do was be reelected

03:40.400 --> 03:42.720
and just didn't care what you do and that's the wrong thing.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.940
I'm not saying, I can't see any easy answers to it, I'm just saying that there are answers.

03:45.940 --> 03:50.480
We are now a technology revolution, we now are going into the computer world and no one

03:51.080 --> 03:55.240
has consistently thought what will happen to most people and in a way behind all the

03:55.240 --> 03:57.420
adventure stories there is a consideration of those problems.

03:58.120 --> 04:02.680
Harrison told us that the grim future depicted in the To the Stars trilogy has its roots

04:02.680 --> 04:04.160
in Orwell's 1984.

04:05.040 --> 04:12.340
The first book plot wise and character wise is a tip of the hat, another head to George

04:12.340 --> 04:13.300
Orwell's 1984.

04:14.280 --> 04:18.600
I even used the word, leaders for pint and their, his thing, they were drinking leaders

04:18.600 --> 04:19.280
instead of pints.

04:19.580 --> 04:25.420
I used the word proles, I put the clues in there for you to find and the brother-in-law

04:25.420 --> 04:33.680
character is the same torturer character from Brian O'Brien, no Brian, no Brian was

04:33.680 --> 04:34.080
the other fellow.

04:34.660 --> 04:40.540
It is the man who knows he's evil and is in charge of an evil society and that's why

04:40.540 --> 04:41.240
he's in the first book.

04:41.940 --> 04:46.720
But having not killed him off in the first, he has to appear again and then you get what

04:46.720 --> 04:49.860
I thought was the only truthful ending and ambiguous ending to the third one.

04:49.860 --> 04:53.060
People hate me for what happened, I said that's what life is.

04:53.620 --> 04:57.160
Science fiction gives you easy answers but in real life there are no easy answers.

04:58.220 --> 05:00.260
We'll have more with Harry Harrison on our next show.

05:07.540 --> 05:12.440
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:12.440 --> 05:16.240
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:07.680 --> 06:11.740
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:27.360 --> 06:32.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.000
And here are your hosts.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.620
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.980
Science Fiction author Harry Harrison writes many styles of science fiction.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.020
One of these is adventure science fiction.

06:49.680 --> 06:53.580
Here he tells us how he came to write Planet of No Return, the sequel to an earlier effort,

06:53.780 --> 06:54.620
Planet of a Damned.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.840
The experiences of publishing produced strange offspring.

07:00.780 --> 07:03.220
I wrote Planet of a Damned years ago.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.920
In a way it's death will one more time, with slight differences.

07:07.460 --> 07:11.400
I wrote Death of a Five or Six Times and one guy is another until I decided to break out

07:11.400 --> 07:12.380
and do Bill a Galactic Hero.

07:13.220 --> 07:20.460
And did that, it was completely into itself and then a few years ago publisher was doing

07:20.460 --> 07:23.960
these illustrated books which really aren't just juveniles, it's what they are.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.000
They are really short novel pictures in them for kids.

07:28.660 --> 07:33.020
And unlike most science fiction writers I ran out of money at the time and he said,

07:33.060 --> 07:34.340
how do you do an illustrated book for me?

07:34.380 --> 07:37.160
I said no, he said we'll give you X number of thousand dollars and I said yes.

07:38.400 --> 07:43.680
And I shopped around my older books and I saw I could do a sequel, a fast paced adventure

07:43.680 --> 07:45.700
book with a little content as well.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.440
There's a little bit about women's rights in there if you look closely at the end.

07:49.580 --> 07:52.000
You know, they're all male fascist swineys guy.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.980
I'd love to kill each other.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.200
And a little bit of plot and mystery plot.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.460
It's been an option for a film to make a nice fast film.

07:57.580 --> 08:01.100
You know, it was not a bad book, it's a juvenile, done for a certain market.

08:01.580 --> 08:04.100
Not ashamed of it or proud of it, just a book I did and there it is.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.800
Humor is another Harrison trademark.

08:07.380 --> 08:10.340
The Technicolor Time Machine is a vintage Harrison humor novel.

08:10.660 --> 08:13.460
Yet when he began it Harrison intended for it to be quite serious.

08:14.560 --> 08:19.400
In the Technicolor Time Machine I applied this very, very serious book.

08:19.940 --> 08:27.040
Time travel and I got this pop-up, so a tan camera and back facing this great big nine-foot tall

08:27.040 --> 08:28.320
fly can I start to laugh.

08:28.780 --> 08:33.900
And it came out funny but if you look there's a very solid time travel plot which could be a serious book.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.780
Except I say in real life I started laughing and I'm laughing why shouldn't the readers laugh

08:37.780 --> 08:40.040
and the way the thing went it took off that way.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.580
And I think it had that serious structure beneath it.

08:43.080 --> 08:47.220
But Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers on the other hand was intended to be funny from a start.

08:48.220 --> 08:53.660
Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers was just, I was feeling a deadly mood one day and I was so tired of rubbish.

08:54.220 --> 09:01.760
I was so tired, you know, dear old Doc Smith wrote his space operas back in the 30s and 40s.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.800
That's a long time ago and at the period form of art I think it's dead.

09:06.240 --> 09:11.240
But I keep seeing certain writers who shall be nameless rehashing old space operas.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.320
I said oh I had enough of this.

09:13.320 --> 09:18.180
So I said why not just put the boot to all the space operas one time have fun doing it.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.580
And I made internal parodies of everyone I could think of.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.380
People accused me of hating Doc Smith.

09:23.540 --> 09:24.860
I said no I don't like, I love Docs.

09:24.920 --> 09:25.900
I'm like, we're bringing Doc Smith.

09:26.380 --> 09:28.120
But I just don't, I think the feel is dead.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.920
I'd like to put a tombstone over it.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.000
Not that you ever can in fiction.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.240
There's still going on doing it anyway.

09:32.380 --> 09:33.520
But I enjoy myself.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.360
The reeds enjoy it.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.120
I mean the two kind of rears.

09:36.260 --> 09:39.120
Some say you're hating Doc Smith, you know, they chase me around.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.340
Others say, I feel a whole bunch here.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.560
You know, so there it is.

09:43.880 --> 09:44.860
It takes your choice.

09:46.060 --> 09:49.760
One of Harrison's latest novels is actually science fiction, but it's being marketed as

09:49.760 --> 09:50.680
a mainstream book.

09:51.360 --> 09:56.700
A rebel in time was a definite attempt to, between myself and the publisher, I had the

09:56.700 --> 09:57.040
idea.

09:57.480 --> 10:03.120
I saw the idea as being something that the non-science fiction reader would buy.

10:03.960 --> 10:08.200
Science fiction sells 20% of all fiction in the United States in paperback which is not

10:08.200 --> 10:08.620
bad.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.200
But being a writer I see 80% more I could sell.

10:12.780 --> 10:13.960
And publishers like to sell more too.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.400
So we talked about the novel.

10:15.580 --> 10:19.040
I said it's pure science fiction, but it starts out as a mystery novel.

10:19.540 --> 10:23.560
And it's a good core of the way into it before the science fiction element is brought in.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.840
And it's a science fiction element that the reader will accept, any general reader.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.340
And that time he's trapped.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.620
10, 20 years ago I couldn't have done that.

10:30.960 --> 10:34.180
Because I had no big name and the reeds would not have bought it.

10:35.220 --> 10:37.180
Now I have enough readers around.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.660
They'll see my name on it.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.900
They'll look at it, open it, maybe buy.

10:39.980 --> 10:40.760
The science fiction reader is.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.740
So I don't think we'll lose one science fiction reader by packaging it that way.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.320
We might pick up a lot of other readers which make me happy, my publisher happy, my wife

10:48.320 --> 10:50.380
happy, my children, my bank manager.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.820
You know all the things we want to make happy.

10:52.740 --> 10:55.260
We'll talk with Harry Harrison about short stories on our next show.

11:01.940 --> 11:07.300
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

11:07.300 --> 11:11.120
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

12:00.420 --> 12:04.380
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:20.040 --> 12:25.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.680
And here are your hosts.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.000
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

12:36.220 --> 12:40.000
Although Science Fiction author Harry Harrison is noted for his many fine novels, he's an

12:40.000 --> 12:41.720
accomplished short story writer as well.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.660
He gave us some thoughts on short stories.

12:44.180 --> 12:49.060
In science fiction, unlike a lot of other fiction, there are people who write both short stories

12:49.060 --> 12:49.660
and novels.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.200
Most, some can, but a lot of them can.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.320
And very simply, it is least residual.

12:56.160 --> 13:01.640
A short story is a one-idea story with a single gimmick or device or a turn of plot.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.360
You write that to length and stop it at two or three or four or five thousand words.

13:06.740 --> 13:08.900
If it's complicated, it goes to ten thousand novelette.

13:09.480 --> 13:14.680
As opposed to a novel, which is a complex thought that requires modifications, more than

13:14.680 --> 13:18.340
one idea, ramifications, and then it goes to novel length.

13:19.860 --> 13:23.060
And many times I first started writing, I had short story ideas.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.900
And they're very good to do.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.280
They go in the magazines, they go in anthologies, read, recognize your name.

13:29.020 --> 13:32.100
And deliberately between novels would do a half dozen short stories.

13:33.040 --> 13:36.480
Unhappily, after a number of years of writing, you find publishers want to give you more

13:36.480 --> 13:37.760
money for novels.

13:38.420 --> 13:39.360
And they really do.

13:39.980 --> 13:43.000
The word rate per word in the novel is about ten times the short story.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.700
And I find myself telling to cook one novel at the end of the other.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.920
I've written a short story in three or four or five years, which I think the shame is

13:50.920 --> 13:54.480
I have four collections of short stories out all selling quite nicely.

13:54.660 --> 13:57.060
And they've been apologizing about 22 languages.

13:57.340 --> 14:00.300
One of Harrison's best known short stories is rescue operation.

14:00.860 --> 14:04.880
It tells about an alien that crash lands in Yugoslavia and of the alien's fate in the

14:04.880 --> 14:06.880
hands of an ignorant superstitious priest.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.900
Harrison's travels in Yugoslavia inspired this story.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.060
Rescue operation came out.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.600
Everything in there I know except the alien.

14:15.440 --> 14:19.400
In Yugoslavia, most broken down country in Western Europe, they have peasants there,

14:19.820 --> 14:22.560
which are much more broken down than German peasants.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.460
They have deeply religious, simple, mindless, stupid people burning peasants within ten

14:29.460 --> 14:30.640
miles of a nuclear reactor.

14:31.180 --> 14:33.100
Perfect analog of our world.

14:33.540 --> 14:38.600
Instead of northern civilized countries, southern poor, uncivilized countries, all in one country.

14:39.640 --> 14:44.240
And having been in the middle of this and having had a number of desperately awful things

14:44.240 --> 14:48.180
happen to me and my family down there, the children got scarlet fever, had injections

14:48.760 --> 14:51.680
with blunt needles, had a carium screaming, you know, sort of thing.

14:52.260 --> 14:54.880
And I got living in that desperate, awful world.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.700
And there it got in the background was there.

14:58.140 --> 15:02.220
And then the thought, instead of arriving in Central Park in front of the White House,

15:02.540 --> 15:04.920
the alien from space arrived there.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.240
Voila.

15:06.460 --> 15:07.280
You know, complete.

15:07.660 --> 15:08.700
Just a matter of riding it.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.960
Another well-known Harrison short story is Mute Milton, the story of a black man whose

15:21.960 --> 15:24.500
bus stops in a small southern town a few years ago.

15:24.900 --> 15:28.380
This moving gut-wrenching story was inspired by an incident in Harrison's life.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.640
Harrison's anger, which comes across clearly in the story, was genuine.

15:32.580 --> 15:37.040
Living in Scandinavia, but now this dates two or three or four years, and the dings

15:37.040 --> 15:38.220
are absolutely colorblind.

15:39.840 --> 15:44.360
That in fact in those days, really certain kind of girls only date black men.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.820
They all go, look, just look down upon them.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.580
There were about four black men in the whole country, you know.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.320
And you know, you just have this very easy to be pro-race, anti-race, if you're in a

15:51.320 --> 15:52.440
country with no race problems.

15:53.340 --> 15:58.000
But living there, the children growing up there, and Martin Luther King was shot, and

15:58.000 --> 16:02.220
a newspaper called me and asked me what my opinion on it, you know, and all horrified.

16:02.780 --> 16:07.480
And then I pick a copy of Newsweek up, and they had some great big belly Alabama.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.360
I photographed him with a shotgun in one hand, a nose picker in the other, and his belly

16:11.360 --> 16:16.720
hanging over his belt, you know, saying, well, just one more nigger to me.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.420
And I just, my white heat engulfed my mind.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.860
You know, one of America's, he got a Nobel Prize earlier than that.

16:23.220 --> 16:26.080
You know, one of America's, well, I was very proud when he came over there.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.180
Then Scandinavia, he's an American getting a prize for doing something really good in

16:30.180 --> 16:31.320
the world, being honored for it.

16:31.800 --> 16:37.920
And I saw red, and the idea came to me, you know, the story just began to put into a story

16:37.920 --> 16:41.600
that rage I had, that strong feeling.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.700
And if I write, I can do that, well, then you're successful story.

16:51.380 --> 16:56.760
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:56.760 --> 17:00.580
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:50.160 --> 17:54.120
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:09.820 --> 18:15.140
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.460
And here are your hosts.

18:23.500 --> 18:27.460
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane, a regional science fiction anthology.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.800
What in the world is that?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.220
Well, it's a collection of science fiction stories written by folks from a particular

18:32.220 --> 18:33.140
area of the country.

18:33.340 --> 18:37.240
Ah, you mean like New York, where science fiction really started, or like California,

18:37.340 --> 18:38.500
where all the writers live?

18:39.020 --> 18:41.560
Well, yes, but try Texas, because that's where the first one came out.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.480
The first regional science fiction anthology was Lone Star Universe, and it was built

18:45.480 --> 18:47.620
as speculative fiction and fantasy by Texans.

18:47.620 --> 18:52.500
Oh, that's the book edited by George Proctor and Stephen Utley that came out in 1976.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.300
It's that collection of 17 short stories written by Texans.

18:56.380 --> 18:56.620
Right.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.640
We got to talk to George Proctor and we asked him how the book came about.

19:00.920 --> 19:07.560
One day, a bunch of us who had just made their first sales were sitting around laughingly

19:08.300 --> 19:11.860
saying, yeah, one day there's gonna be enough writers in Texas that we can put out our own

19:11.860 --> 19:14.860
anthology and to hell with all these people that'll buy our stories.

19:16.220 --> 19:22.720
And as it was, I think that was Howard Waldrop was there, Stephen Utley, Buddy Saunders,

19:22.860 --> 19:25.080
and we're just sitting around joking, putting a fanzine together.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.060
And I guess I was the only person that really sort of took it seriously.

19:34.320 --> 19:39.780
And as it was, Stephen and I put a proposal together and sent it first to a man out in

19:39.780 --> 19:40.480
Midland, Odessa.

19:41.200 --> 19:46.200
His name escapes me now, but he was doing Texana type books.

19:47.260 --> 19:55.820
And he came back and liked the idea, but wasn't going to pick it up and suggested we send it to Heidelberg Press in Austin.

19:55.980 --> 19:58.660
And we did and they picked it up.

19:59.020 --> 20:08.900
And by that time, there were enough known writers in Texas and award winners that it really did seem feasible and seem like a good idea.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.100
And that put together.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.520
Sort of interesting.

20:17.000 --> 20:29.240
It makes for a lot of jokes, you know, regional science fiction, but our thought was, you know, Texana's in and here's this whole realm that's never been really looked at.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.120
And what's funny is it sparked a lot of other regional science fiction books.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.820
It was the first and everybody chuckled and laughed.

20:38.060 --> 20:42.780
And then there was about five that came out on its heels because it had never been thought of.

20:43.400 --> 20:48.760
And what was funny is that I meet new editors in New York.

20:50.840 --> 20:58.120
And they know my name be a lone star universe rather than some of the novels I've done, which is surprising.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.800
But again, New York is surprised by new ideas.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.580
And that's, I think, the reason it was noticed.

21:08.860 --> 21:09.740
And that's why it's so interesting.

21:13.440 --> 21:19.140
Hey, I know a lot about science fiction and I have this vast collection of science fiction books.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.080
Well, maybe it's only half vast.

21:21.420 --> 21:25.240
But anyway, I've never seen a copy of Lone Star Universe, let alone heard of it.

21:25.360 --> 21:25.780
What gives?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.420
There's a good reason for that.

21:27.780 --> 21:30.260
Proctor told us that the book received only limited distribution.

21:31.460 --> 21:36.280
Heidelberg stopped publishing as best I can tell just about the time they brought out the book.

21:37.500 --> 21:42.140
There were big plans to do posters and everything to go with the book.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.040
Full posters of the cover, which the cover is gorgeous.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.660
It's one of those double take covers.

21:49.360 --> 21:53.360
And as it was, they sort of went out of business about that time.

21:54.240 --> 21:59.040
And far as I know, only a few thousand were distributed and they're still sitting in a warehouse somewhere.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.260
Making a scarce item.

22:04.460 --> 22:09.640
It's surprising that you go to conventions, large conventions in and out of state.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.380
And there will always be several people asking me how you get a copy of the book.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.720
It's rare because it was not distributed.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.140
And there's apparently tons of the books still around.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.520
You just can't get ahold of them.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.620
It's a nice item to have for a collector.

22:25.640 --> 22:28.260
Well, you can bet I'm going to be on the lookout for that book.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.720
In the meantime, we'll have more about Lone Star Universe on our next show.

22:39.100 --> 22:44.520
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:44.780 --> 22:47.660
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:38.100 --> 23:42.020
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:58.260 --> 24:03.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.440
And here are your hosts.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.680
This is Daryl Lane.

24:12.860 --> 24:13.460
And Bill Vernon.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.960
Last time we talked about Lone Star Universe, the first regional science fiction anthology.

24:18.280 --> 24:23.360
Edited by George Procter and Stephen Utley, Lone Star Universe is a collection of short stories written by Texans.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.820
The anthology is a sought after collector's item.

24:25.940 --> 24:29.780
It's not readily available because it was poorly distributed when it was published in 1976.

24:30.380 --> 24:36.260
We talked with one of the editors, George Procter, and we asked him if the book might someday be reprinted, perhaps as a paperback.

24:37.120 --> 24:42.820
I don't think so because I think it is, you know, it's a limited item to Texana.

24:43.240 --> 24:48.660
I really think it has more value as Texana than it does to the science fiction field.

24:48.660 --> 24:52.220
As a whole, those science fiction collectors want it because it is a first.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.540
The stories are good.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.080
I think there's a wide variety of stories.

25:00.880 --> 25:08.060
Science fiction reviews that I saw of it, their complaint was that there was a wide variety of stories in there.

25:08.260 --> 25:10.160
It wasn't all nuts and bolts.

25:10.360 --> 25:13.520
It wasn't all new way, but there was everything.

25:13.520 --> 25:21.420
And that's the whole idea of the book was to show the diversity of the science fiction writers in this state.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.760
I think it did that well.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.660
I think it produced good stories by everybody that was in there.

25:28.580 --> 25:32.560
Procter told us that editing a second volume of Lone Star Universe is not out of the question.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.620
There may or may not be.

25:36.620 --> 25:45.900
It depends on, you know, I know of one person now who has his editor for a Texas publisher.

25:47.640 --> 25:58.340
And he has mentioned in passing that he'd like to get a hold of the first book since it never was really distributed.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.360
It's maybe buy them all out if possible.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.200
Well, they're not that'll ever happen.

26:03.960 --> 26:04.900
It's something else.

26:05.000 --> 26:05.780
But yeah, why not?

26:05.880 --> 26:06.360
It was fun.

26:07.660 --> 26:10.420
The people who got it seemed to enjoy it.

26:10.660 --> 26:15.920
And I still think if it would get some sort of distribution, it would be a money making book in Texas.

26:15.920 --> 26:34.660
Just the charisma of the state and the chauvinistic attitude of Texans, which is equivalent to New York, we're just larger.

26:37.140 --> 26:38.360
We buy Texana.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.800
Whether we read it or not, we buy it.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.740
And I think there's a market for it.

26:52.540 --> 27:00.740
So Proctor feels that Lone Star Universe might be more in demand as a collector's item for collectors of Texana than his reading material for science fiction readers.

27:01.140 --> 27:04.640
We ask him why Texas seems to be spawning so many new science fiction writers.

27:05.300 --> 27:06.560
They've always been around.

27:07.220 --> 27:10.220
They've never been noted as Texan before.

27:10.220 --> 27:22.780
And I think early 70s to mid 70s, we had a lot of fans who turned professional, started selling their stories.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.960
They were friends from all over the state.

27:25.740 --> 27:31.720
They suddenly became a very large group that we're selling and we're noticeable.

27:34.680 --> 27:44.180
That this group was here, had made it, gave a lot of other folks who wanted to write incentive to do it.

27:44.280 --> 27:55.000
And you've got suddenly a whole second wave of Texas writers coming out, meeting them here for the first time, that have just begun to sell their first stories or their first novel.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.720
But you've suddenly got a second wave of Texas science fiction writers, which is kind of nice.

27:59.780 --> 28:04.660
Texas writers have been rearing their heads recently and Lone Star Universe is an excellent anthology of their work.

28:05.260 --> 28:10.560
Other regions are producing a lot of science fiction these days, notably Oregon, Florida, upstate New York and New Orleans.

28:11.160 --> 28:15.860
But it was the Texans, with their bigger than life state and their pride, who produced the first regional anthology.

28:22.600 --> 28:31.800
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
