Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.660 --> 00:33.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.780 --> 00:38.280
And here are your hosts.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.460
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

00:44.980 --> 00:47.180
James Gunn approaches science fiction from many angles.

00:47.660 --> 00:51.840
He writes it, he teaches it, and he's published important historical and critical material

00:51.840 --> 00:52.560
in science fiction.

00:53.080 --> 00:57.760
Some of Gunn's better known novels include the Joymakers, the Immortals, the Listeners,

00:57.920 --> 00:58.640
and the Dreamers.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.100
The Immortals was the basis for the television show of a few years back, The Immortal.

01:03.820 --> 01:07.480
Gunn's critical work, in addition to numerous essays, consists of two major publications,

01:08.260 --> 01:12.840
Alternate Worlds, a 1975 history of science fiction, and The Road to Science Fiction,

01:13.060 --> 01:16.860
a four-volume anthology that includes Gunn's essays on the definition of science fiction

01:16.860 --> 01:18.020
and its historical development.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.160
Gunn's criticism is valuable because it not only comes from someone who knows the field,

01:22.280 --> 01:25.880
but also because Gunn is a scholar and professor at a major university.

01:26.260 --> 01:29.200
He brings the insight of a professional academic to the field.

01:29.550 --> 01:33.200
We talked with Gunn about how he divides himself between being both a writer and a teacher.

01:33.780 --> 01:36.380
We asked him if he'd ever considered writing as a full-time career.

01:36.980 --> 01:43.560
I did, as a matter of fact, write full-time for a period of a little more than three years,

01:43.780 --> 01:56.520
a year, in 1948-49, and I went back to school then and got a master's degree, but I continued

01:56.520 --> 02:05.280
to write, and then after I'd worked for this paperback publisher, after I got my master's

02:05.280 --> 02:10.280
degree, worked for a paperback publisher for a year and a half, I found out that I'd sold

02:10.280 --> 02:13.860
four stories that I hadn't known about and decided to go back to full-time writing.

02:14.580 --> 02:26.500
So I did write full-time from the fall of 1942 until the late summer of 1948.

02:26.520 --> 02:34.760
I did write a book in 1955, and really much of the groundwork for the later books that

02:34.760 --> 02:41.640
I published and the success that I had, I think, especially it was, was based upon that

02:42.300 --> 02:47.440
freelance period. I didn't make a lot of money at it, you know, below the poverty level,

02:47.820 --> 02:56.500
but my needs were fairly simple at that time, and what it later paid off in the late 1950s

02:56.520 --> 03:01.880
was, in the sense that the stories that I wrote appeared in books, and some of them

03:01.880 --> 03:03.760
even were made in the movies and all that sort of thing.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.980
Gunn explains how I became involved in teaching.

03:07.840 --> 03:15.960
It was after 1955, or in the fall of 1955, after my wife and I had moved back to Lawrence,

03:16.100 --> 03:23.640
Kansas, simply as a place to live, that I got involved almost by accident with teaching

03:23.640 --> 03:28.920
at the university, from which I'd gotten my two degrees, the University of Kansas, and

03:29.350 --> 03:34.760
became involved with other aspects of the university, edited the alumni magazine for

03:34.760 --> 03:41.440
three years, and then became director of public relations for the university for twelve years,

03:41.660 --> 03:46.700
before returning to full-time teaching and writing in 1970.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.900
Gunn had always intended to write science fiction criticism.

03:50.780 --> 03:59.540
But looking back upon it, I know, I think right from the beginning, I had the feeling

03:59.540 --> 04:07.800
that I wanted to do criticism in the area. My first ten stories, for instance, were

04:07.800 --> 04:19.800
published under a pseudonym of Edwin James, using, I began to use my own name with the

04:19.800 --> 04:26.220
reason I can remember now for doing that, was the fact that I thought I would write

04:26.220 --> 04:32.860
criticism about science fiction, and I wanted to save my real name for that. But after ten

04:32.860 --> 04:39.400
stories, I decided that was foolish, and I ought to use my real name for everything.

04:40.780 --> 04:48.580
But looking back upon it, I think the academic interest was there right from the beginning.

04:49.360 --> 04:53.980
Beginning next time, we'll talk with James Gunn about his writing, both the stories and

04:53.980 --> 04:54.580
the criticism.

05:01.780 --> 05:06.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:06.140 --> 05:10.340
Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:43.340 --> 05:46.140
Thank you.

05:57.180 --> 06:01.140
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:16.800 --> 06:26.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy. And here are your hosts.

06:31.140 --> 06:36.300
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Anne. James Gunn, author, critic and teacher of science fiction,

06:36.660 --> 06:40.920
has written some valuable books on the definition and historical development of science fiction.

06:41.260 --> 06:45.400
He's examining some big questions in this work, things like what is science fiction,

06:45.740 --> 06:48.520
what makes it different from other literature, and where it comes from.

06:48.640 --> 06:53.180
And since Gunn is a professor at the University of Kansas, besides being a long time author

06:53.180 --> 06:57.640
of science fiction, he combines a scholar's objectivity and a creator's understanding

06:57.640 --> 06:59.080
in answering these questions.

06:59.660 --> 07:04.820
Alternate Worlds, published in 1976, is his first major critical work. Gunn explains its

07:04.820 --> 07:05.140
origin.

07:06.060 --> 07:12.520
I had, when I first went back to full-time teaching, had been asked if I would teach

07:12.520 --> 07:17.920
a science fiction course, which is different from the experience at most universities,

07:17.920 --> 07:27.340
where there is some resistance to the notion of doing that. And I accepted because I had

07:27.340 --> 07:32.360
the feeling that there wasn't a good history of science fiction, and that this course would

07:32.360 --> 07:44.220
give me the incentive to write it. So I sat down and wrote very fast, and ended up with

07:45.160 --> 07:57.140
13 chapters representing about 13 lectures for the 14-week semester. And these chapters

07:57.340 --> 08:05.240
or these lectures became the 13 chapters in a book of mine, which appeared in about,

08:05.520 --> 08:14.240
I guess, 75, after some delays, as Alternate Worlds, the illustrated history of science

08:14.240 --> 08:20.580
fiction. But as it won consequence of its publication, I got a call one day from an

08:20.580 --> 08:27.760
editor at New American Library who was admiring it and asked me if I'd like to do a book

08:27.760 --> 08:39.220
for them. And I knew also that I really felt the need for anthologies which covered more

08:40.020 --> 08:49.260
than the brief span of the 20s to the 60s, which most anthologies did, and there really

08:49.260 --> 08:54.520
wasn't much in the 20s or 30s most of it, appeared, covered the period of the 40s and

08:54.520 --> 09:04.400
50s. So I said yes, and I sent them a proposal for the first volume of the Road Science Fiction.

09:04.540 --> 09:13.360
At that time, all we knew that there would be would be one volume which covered the period

09:13.360 --> 09:22.940
from the earliest prehistory of literature, not to mention science fiction, up to 1900

09:23.720 --> 09:32.560
and the H.G. Wells' early stories and novels. The volume used a unique and valuable approach

09:32.560 --> 09:37.100
to science fiction criticism. It was an anthology of stories, but each story was accompanied

09:37.100 --> 09:41.560
by an essay which covered the story's importance and also discussed the period of science fiction

09:41.560 --> 09:45.200
history to which it belonged. Gunn explains how that volume led to others.

09:45.920 --> 09:51.880
By the time I got finished with the manuscript, I had felt that it really, unlike most books,

09:52.040 --> 09:55.900
came out even better than I thought it was going to, and I proposed that we go ahead

09:56.500 --> 10:04.040
with a second and third volume. They said, let's wait and see how this does, and eventually

10:04.040 --> 10:12.720
after it had done better than they thought, they agreed that I could go on to volume two

10:12.720 --> 10:25.120
and three, which covered the period from 1900 to approximately 1940, and then from 1940

10:25.120 --> 10:34.020
to 1970, or actually late 1976. Gunn has recently published a fourth volume in the

10:34.040 --> 10:37.540
science fiction series and says that it's now finished. The title for the entire series

10:37.540 --> 10:41.100
is the Road to Science Fiction, and it stands as a major work of science fiction criticism.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.240
We'll talk some more about it with James Gunn next time.

10:51.400 --> 10:55.680
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

10:55.680 --> 10:59.880
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.640
Thank you.

11:44.280 --> 11:48.180
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:04.140 --> 12:09.180
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.500
And here are your hosts.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.660
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.980
James Gunn is noted not only as an author of science fiction, but as a critic of the

12:23.980 --> 12:26.380
field and as a chronicler in the story of its development.

12:26.680 --> 12:31.140
Gunn has recently completed the last volume in his four volume series, The Road to Science

12:31.140 --> 12:35.520
Fiction. In this unique work, he traces the development of science fiction from the very

12:35.520 --> 12:38.200
beginning of recorded literature until the present day.

12:38.540 --> 12:42.520
What's different and valuable about Gunn's approach in the road to science fiction is

12:42.520 --> 12:46.320
that he uses the actual literature itself, from tales belonging to the ancient world

12:46.320 --> 12:47.300
and modern short stories.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.840
But each literary selection is accompanied by an essay which discusses the work's importance

12:51.840 --> 12:54.760
and deals with the historical period to which it belongs.

12:55.260 --> 12:58.740
When using the volumes then, a reader not only is getting some good science fiction,

12:58.740 --> 13:02.600
but he's picking up an education relating to the definition and development of science

13:02.600 --> 13:02.960
fiction.

13:03.500 --> 13:08.320
Except for the last one, each volume is also organized around a particular thesis or point.

13:08.920 --> 13:12.340
The first one, for instance, develops the idea that before real science fiction could

13:12.340 --> 13:15.400
exist, mankind had to recognize the concept of change.

13:16.380 --> 13:23.040
It seems to me that the essential nature of science fiction is that it deals with change.

13:23.930 --> 13:30.860
In fact, in order for us to recognize a story or a novel as being science fiction, we have

13:30.860 --> 13:38.060
to identify that part of it which is different from here and now, our everyday world.

13:39.880 --> 13:46.840
And so it deals with how people would react in changed circumstances.

13:48.940 --> 13:56.740
So, up to approximately the time of the Indesta Revolution, the very concept of change itself

13:57.310 --> 14:00.780
was alien to human minds.

14:02.170 --> 14:11.520
It seems to me, looking back over the history of humanity, that mostly people saw change

14:11.520 --> 14:23.100
as being only the eternal circle of the seasons changing from spring to summer to fall to

14:23.100 --> 14:24.620
winter and back again.

14:25.420 --> 14:31.840
And it wasn't until the Indesta Revolution and, of course, the scientific perceptions

14:32.060 --> 14:41.360
that preceded it and accompanied it, which began to create change that people saw could

14:41.360 --> 14:47.780
be beneficial and in which they could, over which they might be able to exercise some

14:48.040 --> 14:48.400
control.

14:48.660 --> 14:57.540
That is, it was man-made change created by human desires and intelligence and it could

14:57.540 --> 15:01.800
be controlled by humanity's exercise of intelligence.

15:02.380 --> 15:10.600
And it seems to me that science fiction was the literary response to that recognition.

15:11.660 --> 15:15.760
The next two volumes develop other ideas that Dunn believes are essential to the development

15:15.760 --> 15:20.460
of science fiction, the notion, for instance, that mankind is a species rather than isolated

15:20.460 --> 15:22.040
tribes or nations or races.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.460
But the last volume is a bit different. This is because it deals with the most recent science

15:26.460 --> 15:29.800
fiction stories and it's more difficult to tell which ones will be important.

15:30.880 --> 15:36.960
In the more current story, this is much more difficult to determine. You can't really say

15:36.960 --> 15:44.240
what stories are important until much after they've been published and you can't certainly

15:44.240 --> 15:49.660
say which are typical until you decide what the period really stands for.

15:50.080 --> 15:56.400
So what I did in the fourth volume was to select stories that I thought dealt with the

15:58.720 --> 16:05.840
literary uses of science fiction. And so that, the volume is primarily concerned not with

16:05.840 --> 16:10.800
questions of generic importance but the question of literary uses.

16:11.780 --> 16:15.560
Gunn has performed a valuable service to the field with the four volumes in his The Road

16:15.560 --> 16:16.680
to Science Fiction series.

16:17.060 --> 16:21.160
By defining science fiction, by demonstrating what makes it different from other types of

16:21.160 --> 16:25.580
literature and by revealing its origins, he's made science fiction more understandable

16:26.020 --> 16:27.140
and more respectable.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.860
Next time we'll talk with Gunn about his own fiction.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

16:41.660 --> 16:45.860
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:30.060 --> 17:33.920
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:49.660 --> 17:59.260
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy. And here are your hosts.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.900
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

18:06.180 --> 18:10.480
In much of his science fiction, James Gunn examines the question of what makes man happy.

18:11.220 --> 18:15.620
He extrapolates a future which seems plausible from current social conditions and asks the

18:15.620 --> 18:17.600
standard science fiction question, what if?

18:17.960 --> 18:23.040
In his 1963 novel The Joymakers, he fills out the question by asking what if man discovered

18:23.040 --> 18:27.180
a drug that would make him perfectly happy, even though it would remove him from the real

18:27.180 --> 18:27.560
world.

18:27.560 --> 18:32.380
Gunn answers the question by saying that man would probably accept the opportunity, and

18:32.380 --> 18:34.700
then he shows what happened to man in society as a result.

18:36.240 --> 18:43.940
Ultimately, as it worked out in the novel, it turned out that the people who wanted happiness

18:45.900 --> 18:55.000
to get what they want, since what one can get in the external world is limited by the

18:55.000 --> 18:59.980
number of people, and the number of people who want this particular thing, ultimately

19:00.440 --> 19:08.440
they get what they want by being fed illusions that they get what they want. And ultimately

19:08.440 --> 19:17.980
everybody ends up floating in amniotic cells living on dreams of success and accomplishment

19:17.980 --> 19:25.160
fed by a machine, which I eventually worked out to be that you are happy when you don't

19:25.160 --> 19:32.660
want anything anymore. And it occurred to me that that is the same as death, and ultimately

19:32.660 --> 19:40.840
the equation for that is that happiness equals death, and that life is still wanting something.

19:41.760 --> 19:47.240
One of Gunn's more recent books, The Dreamers, also published in Paperback as The Mind Master,

19:47.240 --> 19:52.000
also presents a society in which man has presumably achieved perfect happiness.

19:52.620 --> 19:57.280
And he does so through chemical memory. Any possible experience can be felt by an individual

19:57.280 --> 20:01.840
if he is injected with the DNA or RNA of someone who has actually undergone that experience.

20:02.440 --> 20:17.080
It is a comment on the fact that dreaming itself is a non-survival characteristic. It may be

20:17.080 --> 20:22.420
satisfying, ultimately the most satisfying experience, but as perhaps I said in The

20:22.420 --> 20:30.440
Joymakers is perhaps repeated here in a different way, that ultimate satisfaction or dreaming

20:31.360 --> 20:43.580
is a death activity, and that survival demands something less than total satisfaction.

20:44.480 --> 20:49.580
Both The Joymakers and The Dreamers, along with many of Gunn's other books, consist of

20:49.580 --> 20:54.780
a series of related novellas, rather than being a straightforward novel. Gunn says that he

20:54.780 --> 20:58.760
started this practice years ago, not long after he began writing science fiction for

20:58.760 --> 21:03.280
a couple of reasons. It allowed him to be paid twice, since he could publish each novella

21:03.280 --> 21:07.300
separately in a magazine before putting it with other novellas to make up a whole novel.

21:08.180 --> 21:18.920
And as a consequence, I have since that time mostly written my novels in the form of publishable

21:18.920 --> 21:25.520
fragments or individual stories. And in a way I think it's worked rather well, because

21:25.520 --> 21:34.800
in The Joymakers I was able to use as a framework, as a subject matter, really an idea rather

21:34.800 --> 21:42.520
than a person or a group of people. And so this novel, which extended over about 200

21:42.520 --> 21:47.940
years, picked up several different people, but basically was about one thing, the science

21:47.940 --> 21:54.280
of happiness. And similarly, the immortals, which also continued for about 200 years,

21:54.460 --> 22:04.300
and the listeners, which took, have covered about 150 years. And all of these seemed to

22:04.300 --> 22:09.240
me to focus on an idea, which is what science fiction mostly does.

22:10.340 --> 22:12.540
We'll continue with the work of James Gunn next time.

22:19.880 --> 22:24.220

23:34.780 --> 23:39.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

This is Daryl Lane.

23:49.960 --> 23:50.580
And Bill Vernon.

23:51.140 --> 23:54.900
The science fiction of James Gunn is based on strong, clear ideas that are developed

23:54.900 --> 23:56.840
in stories with a good deal of action in them.

23:57.020 --> 24:02.380
One of his better known books, a 1962 novel entitled The Immortals, is based on a classic

24:02.380 --> 24:07.500
science fiction premise. What if immortality were possible? What would it do to society

24:07.500 --> 24:08.480
and to human nature?

24:08.900 --> 24:13.460
The novel focuses on Marshall Cartwright, who is immortal, and a search forum by Leroy

24:13.460 --> 24:17.440
Weaver, a dying millionaire who wants Cartwright's blood so that he himself can be immortal.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.320
But the novel is more than a chase or a search.

24:21.620 --> 24:28.000
Certainly, the notion of the search for the immortal, the person that I call Cartwright,

24:29.380 --> 24:37.020
Marshall Cartwright, was in there to provide a core of interest. But I was primarily interested

24:37.640 --> 24:46.620
in the novel on the impact of the possibility of immortality on society itself, and interested

24:46.620 --> 24:56.120
in dealing with those kinds of impulses that people have relating to immortality and longevity.

24:56.980 --> 25:01.860
By examining people's reactions to immortality, Gunn hopes to make a point about human nature.

25:02.440 --> 25:09.160
And in a certain sense, the immortals embodies as well as anything else that I've written,

25:10.020 --> 25:18.460
my basic philosophical position in my work that can be traced through almost all of it,

25:18.460 --> 25:27.700
I suspect, that there are no real villains in life. There are only people who want the

25:27.700 --> 25:34.740
same things everybody else wants, but who are willing to do to get them things that

25:34.740 --> 25:45.420
other people are not willing to do. And that the best things in life can be wanted too

25:45.420 --> 25:54.000
much, that if you anything that is considered good can be an evil. And I suppose one of

25:54.000 --> 26:01.960
the basic concepts with which I began the immortals was the concept that everybody thinks

26:01.960 --> 26:09.900
that it would be wonderful to live forever. But what if you had a man who accidentally

26:10.280 --> 26:16.760
could live forever, but who also whose blood could rejuvenate other people, and his life

26:16.760 --> 26:24.720
would be made miserable. And from there, of course, the entire extrapolation about the

26:24.720 --> 26:36.400
ways in which society, knowing the possibility of immortality, would force people, would force

26:36.400 --> 26:46.400
society to pour more and more and more money into medicine until the law of diminishing

26:46.400 --> 26:54.600
returns would mean that half of the world would be devoted to medicine and everybody

26:54.600 --> 27:05.560
else would be starving in the slums. Gun does indeed show the negative effects of

27:05.560 --> 27:10.480
the inequality, cause medical costs to rise drastically, and would also create a society

27:10.480 --> 27:14.480
so obsessed with seeking to live forever that it would forget to live for now.

27:15.060 --> 27:19.540
In 1969 there was a television series based on the immortals. We asked Gun what he thought

27:19.540 --> 27:19.820
of it.

27:20.660 --> 27:27.660
Well I thought it was a total disaster, and that's not uncommon of course, but the resemblances

27:28.400 --> 27:38.120
between the novel and the book are very slight. My book starts with the immortal being a drifter

27:38.120 --> 27:45.080
who comes in and sells a pint of blood, and then disappears for the rest of the novel

27:45.080 --> 27:53.960
until the very end. And the television series is all about the immortal and his being pursued,

27:53.960 --> 28:02.000
and eventually it turns into simply another search for the papers, another fugitive. Somebody

28:02.000 --> 28:05.520
is being chased, but it makes no real difference why he's being chased.

28:12.860 --> 28:17.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

28:17.640 --> 28:21.460
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.020
Thank you.
