This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.700
And here are your hosts.

00:44.240 --> 00:52.860
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. For 20 years, Roger Zelazny has been
writing science fiction and fantasy. He tells us why and how he became a science

00:52.860 --> 00:59.320
fiction writer. Well, it's a funny thing. I was

00:59.320 --> 01:08.760
originally a reader of science fiction from about the age of 11 on through high
school. And during that period, I did write a lot of science fiction stories,

01:08.800 --> 01:23.140
which I tried to sell, but I was like in my early teens. And I didn't really
meet with any success at that point. And I decided, actually before that, that

01:23.140 --> 01:32.860
I'd wanted to be a writer. I wasn't, it wasn't necessarily science fiction that
I had in mind, though. It was science fiction stories that I was writing during

01:32.860 --> 01:40.480
the period I was reading them. When I went to college, I stopped reading science
fiction, just to concentrate on the material I had there. And I wrote poetry,

01:40.500 --> 01:50.900
actually, exclusively. I decided that I was going to start writing again as soon
as I got out of college and had some time. And at that point, I wasn't

01:50.900 --> 02:06.960
absolutely certain what it was that I would try writing. But when the
opportunity finally presented itself in early 1962, I decided it might be easier

02:06.960 --> 02:17.740
for me to break into science fiction since I had read so much of it in the past.
I knew the area, so I decided I'd try there first. And I went out and re

02:17.740 --> 02:29.140
-familiarized myself with science fiction. And then I began writing and
submitting the stories. And after about six or seven weeks, I sold my first one.

02:30.820 --> 02:42.100
And I sold 16 others that year, so I stayed with it. Zelazny has always been
recognized as a stylist, a writer to whom craftsmanship is important. His

02:42.100 --> 02:49.880
characters have depth, and his prose is coherent and flexible. Right. And that's
an important point to make. Science fiction has traditionally been a field in

02:49.880 --> 02:57.820
which style and character were secondary to plot and idea. Zelazny's college
background in his major field of study, English, may have had some influence on

02:57.820 --> 03:10.160
his writing. As an undergraduate, I was a psychology major. And I decided I did
not really want to work as a psychologist. And it occurred to me somewhere along

03:10.160 --> 03:21.580
the line that if I were simply going to be teaching and writing with the aim in
mind of eventually writing full time, I might as well teach something that would

03:21.580 --> 03:32.540
be a little more fun than psychology. So I switched to English and took my
graduate work in English and comparative literature. As a result of this

03:32.540 --> 03:43.180
background, Zelazny says, his stories had some characteristics not common to
traditional science fiction. I suppose having grown up on the earlier sort of

03:43.180 --> 03:55.420
science fiction, the space opera sort of thing of the 30s and 40s too, and the
harder science stories of the 40s and some of the sociological science fiction

03:55.420 --> 04:10.740
of the 50s, and having a background in literature, there's a natural tendency,
whether it's conscious or not, to want to do something different than things

04:10.740 --> 04:21.420
that had gone before. As a consequence, my stories, well, the first ones were
basically gimmick stories because it was the easiest way to break in. It was

04:21.420 --> 04:30.660
about all that I was capable of doing at the time. But when I began writing at
greater length and when I was a bit sure of myself, I would think of the

04:30.660 --> 04:39.740
characters first, so the stories tended to have more, I suppose, in the way of
psychological motivation rather than just external characterization.

04:42.120 --> 05:00.480
And my writing itself, possibly because of the years I'd spent writing poetry
and reading general literature, tended to be a bit different from some of the

05:00.480 --> 05:06.900
earlier things which were kind of journalistic in character. More next time
about Roger Zelazny.

06:29.740 --> 06:35.200
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.760
And here are your hosts.

06:44.040 --> 06:52.040
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Science fiction authors sometimes write
fantasy, and fantasy authors sometimes write science fiction. Roger Zelazny

06:52.040 --> 07:02.780
writes both. He talks about the differences between the two forms. I do make the
distinction myself. I mean, in a science fiction story, everything, I feel,

07:03.580 --> 07:16.900
should be explainable in terms of natural laws or extensions of natural laws as
we understand them now. Whereas in a fantasy story, it's part of the rules of

07:16.900 --> 07:25.540
the game, so I feel there are no compunctions against invoking the supernatural
or bringing in magic and things of that sort.

07:28.280 --> 07:39.180
And so basically a science fiction story, things are ultimately explainable in a
fantasy story. They're explainable really in terms of something that isn't

07:39.180 --> 07:44.380
explainable. So you've got more of the... You've got the...

07:46.440 --> 07:58.460
The less rational background if you push things far enough in a fantasy story.
Zelazny says he writes some of his books so that they can be read either way. I

07:58.460 --> 08:01.500
also believe in mixing the two.

08:05.000 --> 08:17.100
Well, Lord of Light, for instance, was a book which... Where I intentionally
wrote it to be taken two ways. A fantasy fan could read it as a piece of

08:17.100 --> 08:29.040
fantasy. Whereas a science fiction fan also had options available to him. Any
single item which occurs in there, which is of an unusual nature, is that

08:29.040 --> 08:39.000
there's ultimately an explanation available for it if the person cares to use
it. If he doesn't, that's fine too. Zelazny makes an interesting point about

08:39.000 --> 08:46.460
science fiction. He says that sometimes a science fiction story will become a
fantasy story after a certain amount of time. And he uses one of his own

08:46.460 --> 08:59.600
stories, A Rose for Ecclesiastes, as an example. It's kind of funny too because
I think the first story for which I became known was a piece called A Rose for

08:59.600 --> 09:00.400
Ecclesiastes.

09:05.400 --> 09:18.580
And one of my reasons in writing this is because I was very fond of the earlier
space operas and things like this where they played John Carter of Mars. And I

09:18.580 --> 09:30.920
had always wanted to do something set on the Mars which existed in these earlier
stories. And I knew at the time I wrote it that it was scientifically impossible

09:30.920 --> 09:39.960
at that point. We already knew enough about Mars to know that the temperature
was not the same as I had it in the story, that the atmosphere was not the same

09:39.960 --> 09:49.620
and so forth. But it was close enough to the point where this knowledge was just
becoming current that I could still get away with doing a thing like that. So I

09:49.620 --> 10:04.140
intentionally wrote that and wrote it in the fashion I did. It was a kind of
exercise in nostalgia on my part. I'd always wanted to do a story set on that

10:04.140 --> 10:14.100
kind of Mars. And I knew that if I waited another year or so I wouldn't be able
to. The same with Venus for my story, The Doors of His Face, The Lamps of His

10:14.100 --> 10:23.980
Mouth. At that point we already were aware that the surface temperature was
about 900 degrees. But still there were these, there was this whole traditional

10:23.980 --> 10:38.000
body of science fiction literature which had a vast watery world, misty and so
forth, that I really had wanted to use at least once in my life. So I did those

10:38.000 --> 10:52.040
two stories as a kind of tribute to the earlier things. But then again I wrote
them the way I was writing then rather than in the older style. So reading them

10:52.040 --> 11:02.600
now they'd have to be regarded as fantasy rather than science fiction because
science has already demonstrated that those circumstances don't prevail. More on

11:02.600 --> 11:03.620

12:22.280 --> 12:27.640
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.140
And here are your hosts.

12:36.360 --> 12:45.020
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Many science fiction and fantasy authors
these days write novels in series, in three, four, and sometimes five book sets.

12:45.020 --> 12:52.960
Jack Chalker's Well World series, or Elizabeth Lynn's trilogy, The Chronicles of
Tornor, are two good examples. It's a commercially attractive idea, for one

12:52.960 --> 13:00.320
thing. If readers like the first book, then there's a ready-made market for the
following ones. And, of course, it also allows an author the scope to pursue a

13:00.320 --> 13:08.240
theme in greater depth and length than a single book would allow. And the extra
depth can give an epic quality to the series. One of the best of the series is a

13:08.240 --> 13:17.260
set of five books by Roger Zelazny, a science fantasy adventure called, simply,
The Amber Series. The first volume is entitled, Nine Princes in Amber, and it

13:17.260 --> 13:27.620
was published in 1971. The other four, The Guns of Avalon, Sign of the Unicorn,
The Hand of Oberon, and The Courts of Chaos. Zelazny calls the book something

13:27.620 --> 13:36.720
besides science fantasy. Whenever I try anything of this sort, I try to give it
an extra twist, is what it is. Basically, I look at it myself as a kind of

13:36.720 --> 13:49.080
heroic fantasy, with a few variations that don't usually occur in that sort of
literature. One of the variations Zelazny develops in the books is what's called

13:49.080 --> 14:07.440
the pattern. It is a kind of archetypal design which exists in the real world,
amber, of which our own earth and a great variety of shadings and variations

14:07.440 --> 14:25.000
thereof exist. Amber is the real world, and the others are referred to as
shadow, our shadow in the stories. The background, the basis of reality in amber

14:25.000 --> 14:34.280
is this design called the pattern, which was inscribed by an ancestor of the
clan,

14:36.100 --> 14:49.540
about whom the story is told. Only a person of the blood of the royal family of
amber is able to walk this pattern and not be destroyed by it. And in the course

14:49.540 --> 15:05.860
of walking the pattern, at some point in his early life, the amberite acquires
the ability to walk through the various shadow worlds. which surround amber, so

15:05.860 --> 15:16.200
that he can travel through an infinity of possibilities to virtually any world
he desires. The basic plot of the series consists of a struggle for the throne

15:16.200 --> 15:24.460
of amber, and in the process, our earth is threatened with destruction, since
we're only a shadow of the real world of amber. In the struggle, the main

15:24.460 --> 15:32.480
character, Corwin, keeps traveling between our earth and amber. Technology
doesn't work in amber, so the people there fight with swords and magic. For this

15:32.480 --> 15:41.140
reason, the books are called science fantasy, or as Zelazny said, heroic
fantasy. They've been very popular, too. Zelazny says the readers have responded

15:41.140 --> 15:51.120
enthusiastically. I have gotten more fan letters on the amber books than
anything else I've ever written. There was a period of a couple years there

15:51.120 --> 15:59.740
where I was getting several letters a week on the amber books. The narrative was
concluded with an exciting climax in the fifth book, The Courts of Chaos.

16:00.160 --> 16:07.080
Because of the wide reader response, though, and because there were some
unanswered questions in that last book, a sixth novel on amber is a possibility.

16:08.200 --> 16:18.800
There is possibly a sixth one. I have made no commitments. I do not have a plot.
But I've been talking about it and thinking about it, publisher.

16:21.520 --> 16:32.840
And it is possible when I get a few things out of the way that I'm writing now
that I might go on and do a sixth one. But so far as the five books that now

16:32.840 --> 16:44.320
exist are concerned, that story is told. That was the story I had in mind.
Anything which would continue, the series would probably take off in a new

16:44.320 --> 16:50.180
direction. It could possibly be from another character's point of view. More
about Roger Zelazny next time.

18:18.620 --> 18:20.220
And here are your hosts.

18:24.380 --> 18:32.340
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. One of the more interesting time travel
books in recent years is Roadmarks by Roger Zelazny. Though time travel is one

18:32.340 --> 18:42.880
of the traditional science fiction themes, Zelazny doesn't often write that type
of story. I have always attempted to avoid time travel stories because I don't

18:42.880 --> 18:56.960
like the paradoxes involved. In fact, the only thing I can think of that I had
done in the past was a short story called Divine Madness. I said that I really

18:56.960 --> 19:00.820
wouldn't write a time travel story unless I came up with a new gimmick.

19:05.180 --> 19:20.160
Well, for Roadmarks, I thought I had something just in the image of time
considered as a superhighway, basically, and withouts for the paradoxes in the

19:20.160 --> 19:36.240
Everett Wheeler parallel world sort of situation. And it was really the image of
the road that fascinated me and led to my writing that particular book. Time is

19:36.240 --> 19:43.940
conceived as a superhighway in Roadmarks, with the exits leading to different
eras throughout time. Zelazny has an interesting story to tell regarding the

19:43.940 --> 19:58.920
origin of the idea behind Roadmarks. I got the idea for that book here in New
Mexico, really. One Sunday I was just out for a drive on I-25, which is a nice

19:58.920 --> 20:01.940
highway

20:01.940 --> 20:14.320
-type road. I took a turn off and drove for a few minutes, and the road rapidly
degenerated until, within a matter of minutes, I was on a dirt road, and I

20:14.320 --> 20:26.720
passed through a place that I couldn't even find on the map. It was a little
village where there was a horse pulling a wagon and no overhead electrical lines

20:26.720 --> 20:39.880
in sight. It was almost as if I had driven back through time into the 19th
century. There were log buildings, and somewhere

20:39.880 --> 20:47.640
around there something started to click, and as I drove back again, the road
improved and improved until finally I was on the superhighway. I started working

20:47.640 --> 21:00.880
out just the mechanisms for the idea of driving through time, which I used in
Roadmarks. Actually, by the time I got home, I had a number of the situations

21:00.880 --> 21:04.060
worked out, and I sat down and began writing it.

21:10.800 --> 21:18.700
The protagonist is a man named Red Dorakeen. He travels up and down this highway
of time in a battered old pickup. And when he's not trying to avoid and outwit

21:18.700 --> 21:25.740
some assassins who are after him, he's running guns to the Greeks back in the
past at Marathon. And there's something else in the book that's a recurring

21:25.740 --> 21:33.780
motif or symbol. Huge dragons that float above the road occasionally. Their
function is not clear, but they seem to have some responsibility for the road.

21:34.040 --> 21:48.460
Oh, they were simply to represent the dark forces, which I tend to bring in any
fantasy novel. In a story like this, there has to be a point where you have to

21:48.460 --> 22:00.780
ultimately reach something that's basically unexplainable. Namely, where did the
road come from and how did it come to function the way that it did? And in

22:00.780 --> 22:12.480
making a decision on that, I could go either way. I could find some science
fiction trappings and explain it, or I could leave it intentionally something

22:12.480 --> 22:24.060
shadowy and with a more fantasy background. If I did that, I'd decide I needed
some symbol to invoke as an ultimate creator of the road, so hence the dragons

22:24.060 --> 22:33.280
and then their tie in with red. Roadmarks, published in 1981, is a different
sort of time travel story, tending toward the fantasy rather than the science

22:33.280 --> 22:41.160
fiction end of the spectrum. And since Roger Zelazny is responsible for it, it's
highly enjoyable. And we'll have more on Roger Zelazny on our next show.

This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

24:10.260 --> 24:11.800
And here are your hosts.

24:16.100 --> 24:23.720
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. Writer Roger Zelazny has won numerous
awards in the field of science fiction and fantasy, and he's been writing it for

24:23.720 --> 24:31.720
some 20 years. So, Zelazny has a scholarly background which often shows up in his
books, the way he uses mythology, for instance, in novels like Lord of Light or

24:31.720 --> 24:40.260
This Immortal, or psychology and The Dream Masters. He has a master's degree in
literature, and his knowledge of history is extensive. He's read deeply in the

24:40.260 --> 24:47.880
mythologies and early literature of mankind, and he also reads a great deal of
modern literature, both science fiction and otherwise. He has some interesting

24:47.880 --> 24:57.300
ideas on science fiction and fantasy and its place in the modern world. Science
fiction is a special genre to him for a few basic reasons. It is, for one

24:57.300 --> 25:06.460
reason, one of the few special places where you still deal with characters

25:07.640 --> 25:20.500
other than those which occur in the modern realistic or naturalistic novel.
Going back to the critic Northrop Frye, who spoke of broke characters into

25:20.500 --> 25:32.060
various modes, science fiction is one of the few places outside of, say, modern
poetry, where a writer can deal with characters in what he called the high

25:32.060 --> 25:41.680
mimetic or the mythic modes, that is, characters who are greater than their
fellow man, or characters who are godlike sometimes. Sometimes in that science

25:41.680 --> 25:52.460
fiction does deal with mutants and aliens and sentient computers and cyborgs and
robots, what have you, just whole categories of beings which are different than

25:52.460 --> 26:01.220
the characters you meet with in a naturalistic or realistic novel. So in that
sense, and I think this is one of the great virtues of science fiction, it gives

26:01.220 --> 26:04.640
the writer more scope for exploration in terms of character.

26:16.080 --> 26:24.060
Besides the freedom or scope that science fiction provides for a writer, it also
has one other quality that Zelazny feels differentiates it from general or

26:24.060 --> 26:36.800
mainstream literature. I think that science fiction is still, basically for all
of the experimentation that went on in the 60s, a bastion of storytelling. The

26:36.800 --> 26:47.280
idea is not necessarily the hero anymore, as it was in the days Kingsley Amos
referred to it as being such back in the 40s, and perhaps the 50s, but we have

26:47.280 --> 26:57.860
real characters now, and ideas are handled in a more sophisticated fashion. The
writing has also improved from a stylistic standpoint, but basically I think if

26:57.860 --> 27:10.300
you looked at the area, well, even statistically, there are more examples of
straightforward storytelling in science fiction than you might find in general

27:10.300 --> 27:21.580
fiction at large. So that is another reason I am very fond of science fiction
because I am basically a storyteller no matter what I do with mythology or

27:21.580 --> 27:32.900
writing devices. Does Zelazny think science fiction will ever merge with general
literature and gain a wider acceptance? I don't think it will necessarily be

27:32.900 --> 27:46.520
merged with the mainstream, and I also do not think that this is necessarily a
bad thing at all. It was Santayana who said about something else entirely, but

27:46.520 --> 27:58.420
which I think is apropos, that to attempt to give such things a wide currency is
to be willing to denature them in order to boast that they've been propagated. I

27:58.420 --> 28:10.840
think science fiction will always have its devotees in that they will grow in
number just as the population itself increases, but I don't know that the

28:10.840 --> 28:19.280
percentage is ever going to increase that greatly. The chances are pretty good
that science fiction has at least a few more readers and fans than it would have

28:19.280 --> 28:25.420
had had Zelazny not taken it up. His works stand as an advertisement for the
quality and value of good science fiction.
