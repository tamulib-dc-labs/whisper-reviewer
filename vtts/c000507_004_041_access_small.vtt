Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.700 --> 00:34.000
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.280
And here are your hosts.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.700
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.620
Charles Sheffield is a relatively new name in the field of science fiction, but he's

00:48.620 --> 00:51.140
published first class stories and novels since 1976.

00:52.060 --> 00:55.680
Sheffield is a practicing scientist and as you might expect his work can be categorized

00:55.680 --> 00:56.580
as hard science fiction.

00:56.900 --> 01:01.280
His novels include Sight of Proteus, Web Between the Worlds and My Brother's Keeper.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.900
He's also had three volumes of short stories published.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.660
We spoke with Sheffield recently and asked him how he first got involved in science fiction.

01:08.460 --> 01:15.840
I read it from the time I was about 13 or 14 years old, but where I was living the idea

01:15.840 --> 01:18.060
of fandom was unknown at the time.

01:18.320 --> 01:25.960
I was raised in East Yorkshire in England and so far as I knew for a long time, in fact,

01:25.960 --> 01:30.820
until I went off to the university, I was the only person I knew who read science fiction.

01:32.040 --> 01:37.040
And then when I got to the university, I found it was not all that uncommon, but at least

01:37.040 --> 01:44.080
until I was 18, it was a private activity and there was no organized effort.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.640
There were no groups of people discussing it, there were no conventions or anything like

01:47.640 --> 01:47.900
that.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.680
It was a solitary reading activity.

01:50.680 --> 01:58.740
And I got into it simply because I was interested in science and it was the only type of writing,

01:59.020 --> 02:03.340
apart from science fact, that appealed to someone interested in science.

02:04.460 --> 02:06.020
There wasn't much of it around, of course.

02:06.660 --> 02:12.540
The period I'm talking about, there were no English magazines that I recall and about

02:12.540 --> 02:19.080
the only things that came over from the United States were astounding, which then became analog

02:19.080 --> 02:26.920
and galaxy and occasionally amazing stories and fantastic stories and that was about it.

02:28.140 --> 02:32.780
We asked Sheffield if he had had a long apprenticeship with rejection slips before selling his first

02:32.780 --> 02:33.220
story.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.420
It was a reasonably long one.

02:36.860 --> 02:41.360
I can't say that I had an endless string of rejections.

02:41.440 --> 02:48.500
I started to write in 76 and didn't have any previous background of trying to write fiction

02:48.500 --> 02:49.260
of any kind.

02:50.200 --> 02:58.260
So I wasn't too discouraged because I realized in my first story or two that I was evolving

02:58.260 --> 02:58.720
rapidly.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.020
In other words, I could reread things of a few months before and say, my lord, no wonder

03:04.020 --> 03:05.040
nobody would buy that.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.080
But once Sheffield hit his stride, his stories became familiar to readers of the science

03:09.080 --> 03:09.740
fiction magazines.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.660
They were always exciting and inventive.

03:11.920 --> 03:15.640
Sheffield, as we mentioned earlier, belongs to that small group of science fiction writers

03:15.640 --> 03:17.060
who are practicing scientists.

03:17.060 --> 03:21.080
He has a degree in theoretical physics and is a vice president of the Earth Satellite

03:21.080 --> 03:22.940
Corporation of Washington, D.C.

03:23.180 --> 03:24.940
We asked him what the corporation does.

03:25.640 --> 03:32.780
What we do is we take information from satellites that look at the Earth as opposed to looking

03:32.780 --> 03:41.780
out in space somewhere and we use that information in looking for natural resources on the Earth

03:41.780 --> 03:44.300
and in measuring them and monitoring them.

03:44.300 --> 03:49.960
So for instance, we have exploration programs in which we look for oil and gas and minerals

03:49.960 --> 03:50.900
around the world.

03:51.080 --> 03:58.360
We have other projects in which we analyze the condition of surface water or of land

03:58.360 --> 03:58.780
use.

03:59.060 --> 04:04.020
We're just finishing a big project for the state of Pennsylvania looking at their abandoned

04:04.020 --> 04:06.020
mine lands to see what condition they're in.

04:06.820 --> 04:14.280
And that's done sometimes from aerial observations in aircraft, but mostly we use satellite data.

04:15.160 --> 04:24.260
And the company is now approaching 13 years old and in a sense was started too soon.

04:24.420 --> 04:29.280
I was there at the beginning, but our first few years were very difficult because we found

04:29.280 --> 04:34.040
that we were in a field in which almost no one knew what we were doing and we would spend

04:34.040 --> 04:40.360
lots of our time trying to explain to people the potential that we believed we could see

04:40.360 --> 04:40.980
in the field.

04:40.980 --> 04:46.900
Well now, enough people have seen examples of it that we find it much easier.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.780
So things have become much smoother for the company in the last few years.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.420
Next time we'll talk with Charles Sheffield about his work.

05:02.740 --> 05:07.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:07.080 --> 05:11.280
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.020
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:21.740 --> 06:27.040
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.360
And here are your hosts.

06:35.880 --> 06:36.960
This is Daryl Lane.

06:37.000 --> 06:37.620
And Bill Vernon.

06:38.120 --> 06:42.540
Charles Sheffield's popular and provocative 1979 novel, The Web Between the Worlds, concerns

06:42.540 --> 06:43.800
a so-called space elevator.

06:44.220 --> 06:47.000
A space elevator is a satellite that is tethered to the Earth.

06:47.420 --> 06:51.000
Of course it would always remain above the same spot on the Earth's surface, or in other

06:51.000 --> 06:52.860
words, it would be in geosynchronous orbit.

06:53.340 --> 06:57.100
Sheffield has his engineers build a satellite in the tether, which is hundreds of kilometers

06:57.100 --> 06:58.460
long, out in space.

06:58.460 --> 07:02.460
The end of this beanstalk, as it's called, is then guided toward a point on the Earth's

07:02.460 --> 07:02.780
equator.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.020
A huge hole is waiting for it.

07:05.320 --> 07:09.440
As the end of the beanstalk enters the hole, millions of tons of dirt and rock are exploded

07:09.440 --> 07:11.000
over it, firmly anchoring it.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.140
Since Sheffield is a practicing physicist, he describes the whole touchy operation in

07:15.140 --> 07:16.600
believable scientific language.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.920
We ask him, though, if this method of anchoring a space elevator is a feasible one.

07:28.960 --> 07:34.380
In other words, what you've got to do is to make sure there's just enough mass at the

07:34.380 --> 07:35.640
bottom sitting there.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.540
Now, there's several ways you could propose to do that.

07:38.720 --> 07:48.540
One is to build the satellite from orbit at synchronous altitude down to the Earth, and

07:48.540 --> 07:55.280
then anchoring it is an easier job because you can put material into it a little at a

07:55.280 --> 07:55.560
time.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.900
You can bootstrap if you like.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.300
You can make a very small cable and gradually build up to a larger one.

08:00.960 --> 08:08.880
I think that the technology we will have in 100 years' time, though, is such that things

08:08.880 --> 08:14.860
we now consider hair-raising and scary and difficult, people will take for granted.

08:15.900 --> 08:20.780
To give an analogy, I like to quote, if you told people 100 years ago that there'd be

08:20.780 --> 08:26.380
hundreds of tons of metal up above the cities, they'd say, well, you could never sleep at

08:26.380 --> 08:29.360
night because you'd be afraid they'd fall on top of you all the time.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.040
But now people just curse aircraft because of the noise.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.560
They don't actually think that there's hundreds of tons of metal suspended up there.

08:37.060 --> 08:43.540
And we're not in constant fear of things collapsing because we have some trust in the

08:43.540 --> 08:44.140
technology.

08:44.640 --> 08:50.140
I believe 100 or 150 years from now, things we now consider hair-raising and scary will

08:50.140 --> 08:57.920
be commonplace, which is why I chose a more way out method of anchoring the beanstalk

08:57.920 --> 08:59.640
than the simplest one.

09:00.560 --> 09:04.220
Though the book deals with numerous scientific concepts and theories, it's an exciting

09:04.220 --> 09:06.840
fast-paced story that should please any reader of science fiction.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.500
One of the non-human characters in the book is a giant squid named Caliban.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.360
Caliban seems to be intelligent.

09:12.820 --> 09:16.480
He lives on the artificial water world of Atlantis and communicates with humans with

09:16.480 --> 09:17.260
the aid of a computer.

09:17.260 --> 09:20.900
We asked Sheffield who he got the idea of using a giant squid as a character.

09:21.580 --> 09:25.880
I needed, well, for several reasons.

09:26.020 --> 09:32.480
One is I'm very interested in cephalopods in the squid and the octopus because they are

09:32.480 --> 09:35.000
the most advanced invertebrate animals.

09:35.920 --> 09:40.560
And I had known for quite a while that squids and octopus are supposed to be very smart

09:40.560 --> 09:41.040
creatures.

09:42.040 --> 09:51.020
So when I wanted a very difficult being to communicate with, the obvious first thought

09:51.020 --> 09:54.580
which many people do is to have a computer as a character.

09:55.280 --> 10:02.080
But I felt since I had a water world in Atlantis, it would be more interesting for me to create

10:02.080 --> 10:10.640
a situation in which the sea creature, Caliban, communicates with the humans only with the

10:10.640 --> 10:11.520
help of a computer.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.680
In other words, the computer is an essential part of the communication process.

10:17.180 --> 10:22.180
And the relationship between the computer and Caliban is a very complex one that even

10:22.180 --> 10:25.480
the human characters in the book, so they don't totally know what's going on.

10:25.980 --> 10:33.080
I simply felt that was more interesting than perhaps having a computer as an instrument.

10:33.340 --> 10:39.020
A smart computer has been done quite a lot, but I felt the computer and cephalopod combination

10:39.020 --> 10:42.180
hadn't been done anywhere that I could see and was a more interesting thing to write

10:42.180 --> 10:42.520
about.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.920
We'll continue our talk with Charles Sheffield on our next show.

10:53.100 --> 10:57.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

10:57.420 --> 11:01.640
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.580
Thank you.

11:50.780 --> 11:54.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:10.640 --> 12:15.740
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.080
And here are your hosts.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.560
This is Bill Vernon.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.400
And Daryl Lane.

12:26.560 --> 12:31.060
Charles Sheffield's most recent science fiction novel, published in 1982, is entitled My

12:31.060 --> 12:33.920
Brother's Keeper, and it's a departure from his normal style.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.940
It's a fast-paced book, as all of Sheffield's works are, but it's set in the very near

12:37.940 --> 12:39.460
future and it reads like a spy novel.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.820
Sheffield talks about it.

13:16.900 --> 13:22.880
The Science Fiction aspects of the story concerns introsomatic chips, tiny microcomputer devices

13:22.880 --> 13:26.820
which are implanted in the human body to control various physiological functions.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.540
Twin brothers named Leo and Lionel are the main characters in the story.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.720
Leo leads an exciting life of intrigue and danger as a government agent involved with

13:34.720 --> 13:35.720
the introsomatic chips.

13:35.720 --> 13:40.220
And Lionel is a conservative man who is a world-renowned concert pianist, hard of the

13:40.220 --> 13:41.180
adventuresome type.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.980
After a helicopter accident involving the two brothers, Leo is dying.

13:45.480 --> 13:49.120
He is saved, in a sense, by a brilliant doctor or scientist who removes part of his brain

13:49.120 --> 13:50.380
and attaches it to Lionel's.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.600
Their personalities are sort of integrated then, and they slowly become one new person.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.460
What had been happening through the book is that it begins.

13:59.920 --> 14:04.900
Lionel, although he is the one with the consciousness, he's the one who thinks he knows who he is,

14:04.900 --> 14:10.240
when they recover consciousness, has always been the subordinate partner.

14:10.880 --> 14:15.520
His brother Leo had always been the stronger personality, the more outgoing one, and really

14:15.520 --> 14:16.340
the dominant one.

14:16.960 --> 14:23.180
Now through the book, Lionel is gradually taking on more of his brother's characteristics.

14:24.140 --> 14:30.200
And certainly at the beginning of the book, Lionel would never have dreamed of going off

14:30.200 --> 14:33.200
and chasing danger because it wasn't his disposition.

14:33.200 --> 14:39.480
So that by the end, they have somewhat fused in personality to the point where it's Leo

14:40.040 --> 14:47.360
who is really driving them along to go out and go after the criminals for the same reason

14:47.360 --> 14:51.740
he had always done it, which is that it was the best form of excitement.

14:52.120 --> 14:57.260
He got excitement from it, and he said at the end that there's really no thrill like it,

14:57.280 --> 14:58.820
which is this type of chase.

14:58.820 --> 15:02.920
But that in a sense is Leo's personality speaking by that point.

15:03.860 --> 15:10.520
Lionel was the somewhat quiet and retiring twin, but by the end of the book,

15:11.800 --> 15:16.320
it's no longer Lionel who is making most of the decisions.

15:16.680 --> 15:20.380
Leo has again become the dominant twin in a psychological sense.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.140
That's the thing I had in mind.

15:30.540 --> 15:34.120
The brain operation which joins the two brothers is not feasible presently,

15:34.340 --> 15:37.340
but Sheffield says it may not be too long before the technique becomes possible.

15:37.600 --> 15:42.560
This is a typical Sheffield story and then it's based on techniques or devices that are just over the horizon

15:42.560 --> 15:44.940
that may be possible in a decade or two.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.880
Right. Sheffield is a convincing extrapolator too,

15:48.080 --> 15:51.340
because he is a practicing scientist with a PhD in theoretical physics.

15:51.720 --> 15:55.200
We ask Sheffield if he writes his stories to seriously examine such concepts,

15:55.520 --> 15:57.280
or if he's just playing around with wild ideas.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.320
It depends on the story.

16:00.920 --> 16:10.340
If I believe that the device is technologically possible and that someday we will have it,

16:10.860 --> 16:14.420
then I try to develop the consequences of that rather seriously.

16:15.020 --> 16:20.540
And in a sense I'm attempting prediction as opposed to writing entertainment.

16:21.120 --> 16:26.360
But on the other hand, if I don't really believe something is likely to happen at all,

16:26.360 --> 16:29.200
then I'm writing for the fun of it.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.680
I'm writing and don't expect to be taken seriously.

16:33.380 --> 16:36.560
We'll continue our conversation with Charles Sheffield on our next show.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.960
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:46.300 --> 16:48.880
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:48.880 --> 16:52.080
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:43.380 --> 17:46.400
The next episode will be about the science fiction radio show.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.060
We'll be back with a new episode of the science fiction radio show.

17:47.060 --> 17:47.600
Stay with us!

18:03.520 --> 18:08.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.020
And here are your hosts.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.720
This is Daryl Lane.

18:18.840 --> 18:19.440
And Bill Vernon.

18:19.840 --> 18:23.120
One of the more fascinating collections of fantasy stories to come out in recent years

18:23.120 --> 18:26.040
is Charles Sheffield's 1982 book, Erasmus Magister.

18:26.320 --> 18:30.240
Sheffield is a scientist and he's noted as an author of hard science fiction stories,

18:30.640 --> 18:35.920
but he also writes in various styles and on unexpected subjects, as Erasmus Magister demonstrates.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.960
The title refers to the main character in all of the book's stories, Erasmus Darwin,

18:40.560 --> 18:43.460
who lived in England's 18th century and was the grandfather of Charles Darwin.

18:43.700 --> 18:46.460
We asked Sheffield if Erasmus was a real historical figure.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.400
Yes, I've been interested in him for a long time.

18:51.120 --> 18:57.460
As somebody I found much more fascinating as a personality than his grandson Charles Darwin.

18:58.120 --> 19:03.400
Erasmus Darwin I had known about since I first went to Cambridge,

19:03.660 --> 19:07.120
because he attended the same college at Cambridge as I did,

19:07.540 --> 19:10.860
and there were books about him in the library and so on.

19:11.220 --> 19:13.580
And so I have an early fascination with him.

19:13.860 --> 19:17.860
And I found him especially interesting because he did so many different things.

19:18.620 --> 19:25.500
And was a poet and a philosopher and an inventor and a famous physician.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.500
And he used just a fascinating combination.

19:28.820 --> 19:36.700
I decided that what I would try to do would be to have him apply his powers of observation,

19:37.040 --> 19:40.720
which were famous throughout Europe in his day.

19:40.720 --> 19:48.060
He was noted for being able to diagnose diseases by looking at people and observing them closely.

19:48.620 --> 19:54.340
I decided that that power of observation would serve him well if he had to solve other mysteries.

19:55.340 --> 19:58.160
He was also a person who was strongly rationalistic.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.300
He didn't believe in supernatural explanations.

20:00.920 --> 20:07.400
So I decided there that it would be logical for him, through his powers of observation and deduction,

20:07.400 --> 20:14.820
to seek and find rational explanations to things that everyone else in the story thought were supernatural,

20:15.120 --> 20:16.100
which was very reasonable.

20:16.260 --> 20:20.820
200 years ago, people were very ready to believe supernatural answers to most things.

20:21.240 --> 20:24.580
So that was the logic behind the stories.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.500
There are three stories in the volume.

20:26.860 --> 20:30.220
The Devil of Malcourc, the Treasure of Odorex, and the Lambeth of Mortal.

20:30.640 --> 20:34.280
And they're extremely difficult to categorize. Sheffield talks about them.

20:34.280 --> 20:40.340
They were published in different places, and it's an interesting point.

20:40.860 --> 20:45.000
The first one was published as a fantasy in Fantastic Stories.

20:46.540 --> 20:51.060
The second one was published in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine.

20:52.740 --> 21:00.300
And the third one, in Time, I'm talking now, in Data Publication, was published in Fantasy and Science Fiction.

21:01.020 --> 21:06.720
Now, in practice, the Devil of Malcourc was the last one written.

21:06.940 --> 21:11.960
That's the first one in the Erasers' Magister, but I wrote that last.

21:12.420 --> 21:19.580
But I was not quite sure when I was writing them, whether I was writing science fiction or fantasy,

21:19.980 --> 21:22.180
or some type of historical detective.

21:22.860 --> 21:25.940
And I finally decided it really didn't make any difference.

21:25.940 --> 21:30.820
I was trying to tell a story about what I consider to be a very interesting real person,

21:31.440 --> 21:35.680
and I tried to get the facts about Erasmus Darwin accurate,

21:35.920 --> 21:41.660
so that I was not doing any distortion to his beliefs and views or life history.

21:41.920 --> 21:47.000
But I permitted myself license when it came to the things that happened to him.

21:47.620 --> 21:51.300
So it was interesting. It was a very interesting set of stories to write.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.000
Sort of very difficult to write. I don't know why.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
Perhaps because I was trying to put myself back in the 18th century framework.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.100
In each story, there is an apparently supernatural happening or creature

22:03.100 --> 22:05.060
that puzzles or bedevils some part of England.

22:05.520 --> 22:09.960
The first story, the Devil of Malcourc, for instance, deals with what we today call a Loch Ness Monster.

22:10.340 --> 22:13.380
The stories are delightful reading. They're exciting, highly literate,

22:13.600 --> 22:17.160
and convincingly communicate the atmosphere of the 18th century English countryside.

22:17.660 --> 22:20.320
A reader of science fiction will find them to be different fare, certainly,

22:20.640 --> 22:22.820
but all the more enjoyable and refreshing because they are.

22:22.820 --> 22:27.220
Sheffield says there will be more Erasmus Darwin stories too, so keep an eye out for them.

22:27.460 --> 22:30.340
We'll finish our conversation with Charles Sheffield on our next show.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:40.460 --> 22:43.020
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:43.020 --> 22:46.240
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.040
The next episode will be about the science fiction radio show.

23:41.220 --> 23:41.600
We'll be back with a new episode of the science fiction radio show.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.220
Stay with us!

23:58.060 --> 24:03.220
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.560
And here are your hosts.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.920
This is Bill Vernon.

24:13.140 --> 24:13.780
And Daryl Lane.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.380
Though Charles Sheffield is noted as an author of hard science fiction stories,

24:17.720 --> 24:20.800
he sometimes writes narratives which are fantastic or humorous.

24:20.800 --> 24:24.920
His stories on Erasmus Darwin, for example, are illustrations of historical fantasy,

24:25.260 --> 24:27.500
but he's also done a series of stories that are pure humor.

24:28.020 --> 24:31.320
And at least once, that humor had a larger purpose or message to it.

24:31.740 --> 24:33.720
The story entitled The Man Who Stole the Moon,

24:33.920 --> 24:37.740
which appeared in the December 1980 edition of the Science Fiction Paperback magazine,

24:37.980 --> 24:41.340
Destiny's, made a serious comment on the United States space program.

24:41.640 --> 24:45.380
But it did so in a humorous way, with a clever twist on one of Robert Heinlein's

24:45.380 --> 24:47.280
classic short stories, The Man Who Solved the Moon.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.180
We asked Sheffield if he meant that story to have a strong message,

24:50.540 --> 24:52.400
and if he's had much reader response to it.

24:53.100 --> 24:58.740
It was very much influenced by Heinlein's story, The Man Who Solved the Moon,

24:59.380 --> 25:01.300
and it was preaching a bit.

25:02.140 --> 25:04.980
And I think that's an example where you said there was a message,

25:05.160 --> 25:08.040
and I said I was preaching, but I haven't really had any response.

25:09.500 --> 25:13.520
And I'm not quite sure what response I would expect for that.

25:13.520 --> 25:18.000
I think that most people who read it and approve of it

25:18.000 --> 25:24.200
are already upset that the way we seem to be unable to have an effective space program.

25:24.500 --> 25:28.480
So the only sort of letters I might think I would get would be people who would agree with it.

25:29.240 --> 25:34.020
The humorous series that he's done involves two bumbling lawyers named Henry Carver and Waldo Burmeister.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.860
These stories seem to have no messages or preaching at all.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.820
They're pure farcical humor, cleverly done and chock-full of puns.

25:40.820 --> 25:43.480
A couple of their titles indicate their farcical nature,

25:43.920 --> 25:46.060
the Dalmatian of Faust and Parasites Lost.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.200
Sheffield calls the stories his sewage series.

25:49.580 --> 25:50.320
We ask him why.

25:52.020 --> 26:00.580
Well, because the two of the first three involved...

26:00.580 --> 26:02.420
Well, let me put it differently.

26:03.100 --> 26:06.560
The first one of all was one involving the Matting Link,

26:06.680 --> 26:09.800
which was not particularly loathsome in any way.

26:09.800 --> 26:18.280
But then the next one was about one of the lawyers who was working in charge of the sewers on a space station.

26:18.420 --> 26:21.460
That was Dinsdale Descent, and duly falls into the sewer.

26:23.440 --> 26:28.000
Then another one, which is the Dalmatian of Faust,

26:28.100 --> 26:30.780
the same individual again falls into a different sewer.

26:32.140 --> 26:44.900
And generally speaking, I regard those stories as stories in which I take ideas that people have said are gross and unpleasant and loathsome and disgusting,

26:45.360 --> 26:46.700
and put them into stories.

26:47.560 --> 26:52.700
And one evening at dinner, we made a long list of things that people found generally distasteful,

26:53.060 --> 26:57.560
and the suggestion was I should just write my way through the list until I got to the end.

26:57.560 --> 27:03.760
And I find that that's all right to a limited extent if you're writing what you hope a humorous story is,

27:03.840 --> 27:07.500
like Parasite's Lost is about a truffle pig,

27:08.000 --> 27:18.940
and the Deemos Plague is another in a series in which a man has to safeguard two large pigs, taking them out to Mars.

27:19.720 --> 27:26.340
The stories generally are not intended to have any message, as you might say, the man who stole the moon has,

27:26.340 --> 27:28.360
or any redeeming features.

27:28.540 --> 27:31.260
I just write them because I find them amusing.

27:31.780 --> 27:35.320
It's very hard to tell whether readers find them amusing or not.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.520
We ask Sheffield if he'll write any more of these humorous stories.

27:39.140 --> 27:45.340
Well, I have one that's sitting there somewhat, I've got about eight pages, and I stopped and did other things.

27:45.340 --> 27:50.420
A story called Space Opera, which involves the same characters,

27:50.800 --> 28:01.640
and what happens when this producer decides to stage a modern opera which has been written.

28:01.800 --> 28:07.620
It's called Balaclava, and they decide to stage it in free fall with the charge of the light brigade and other complications.

28:08.140 --> 28:11.640
But I haven't written the rest of it because I've been too busy writing other things.

28:11.640 --> 28:15.380
It's sitting there over on the desk there, and sometime I'll write it.

28:15.620 --> 28:20.760
But I write those occasionally with no fixed timetable, just when I feel like it.

28:21.660 --> 28:26.380
Let's hope Charles Sheffield gets some more of these stories out. Humor and science fiction can be refreshing.

28:33.560 --> 28:38.920
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:38.920 --> 28:42.120
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.260
The Science Fiction Radio Show
