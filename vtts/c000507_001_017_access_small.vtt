00:01.240 --> 00:06.660
An evening for James Blige, presented at the Institute of Contemporary Arts at London,

00:07.240 --> 00:09.620
February 19 1976.

00:43.580 --> 00:54.400
James Blige, an American writer, died here in London on the 30th of July, last year.

00:56.540 --> 01:08.820
He left a large and distinguished body of work behind him, and I am as convinced as his fellow of all his other admirers are,

01:09.820 --> 01:25.080
that at least some of that work is similar by originality of imagination, by intelligence, and by a mysterious sense of style,

01:25.080 --> 01:33.580
that is certain, to form a feminine part of our literary heritage.

01:34.660 --> 01:42.200
A week before his death, he had run a large and devoted fellow of the New York,

01:43.240 --> 01:53.540
not only here but in the United States and increasingly throughout the rest of the world, as his work became more and more widely translated.

01:56.540 --> 02:01.920
I first got to know him, and this gives me a chance, very briefly, to introduce myself.

02:02.440 --> 02:10.140
I work in favor and favors, and many long years ago, in the early 50s, when I first joined the firm,

02:10.780 --> 02:22.960
I did serve a hard-rearing and secret vice, which was a Persian force, on 6th and it didn't at first frighten me that I could persuade him

02:23.620 --> 02:31.540
to take favor in favor to embark on the transcription, but I was in bolden to share my hand when I discovered that Jesse Faber,

02:32.120 --> 02:42.160
the founder of the firm, shared my own secret passion, and I happened to know that a friend of mine, Bruce Montgomery,

02:42.540 --> 02:47.980
who worked in a painting, who was the director of the story, along with the student of Edmund Crispin,

02:47.980 --> 03:00.980
he too shared that passion, and with Jeffrey Devers' enthusiastic support, I asked Crispin if he would put together for us an

03:00.980 --> 03:09.740
anthology of science fiction stories, which he did, and the thought that I think become, in a very light, a classic anthology,

03:09.980 --> 03:17.080
that is, F, which has been followed up by many successors, when we outnodged the F-6 settlement, eventually, 8.

03:18.900 --> 03:24.780
And in that Boolean collection of short stories, in fact, many of my major people were to see,

03:24.780 --> 03:32.920
I'd say in a Boolean journey, well, a long years ago, in Alberta, by a particular new name to me at that time, James Lish,

03:33.860 --> 03:40.760
a case of conscience. So, it was through both the F-6 and the case of conscience that the name James Lish

03:40.760 --> 03:49.600
both made an impact on my mind, and it's quite appropriate that today we should be remembering Jim Lish,

03:50.360 --> 03:57.540
since it's due to Crispin that it happened, and Crispin, who has been very, very serious to him,

03:58.200 --> 04:07.740
made a moment to cover it, and early this morning, he got married, and I was able to, and we could get together one morning,

04:07.920 --> 04:12.820
and I know he's with us all the time, so it's a nice, it's a nice, it's a nice...

04:14.700 --> 04:20.520
Well, as a publisher, that might be a little bit of a crowd about this with other books,

04:20.620 --> 04:26.860
and the first books had turned up from a medical earsemen from home, which had helped me spellbind,

04:27.020 --> 04:32.600
and I'm afraid very, very, very, that kind of are useless, so rather her boring meeting

04:32.600 --> 04:38.100
when I saw a disability in an earsemen from home, we published that, and it was followed in due course,

04:38.100 --> 04:46.420
by their whole wonderful switches and flight sequence of novels, which is in effect the greater and higher star trek.

04:47.780 --> 04:57.080
I personally met Jim first of all in New York in the middle of the 1950s, and he made a non-forgetful impression

04:57.080 --> 05:03.440
that more of a moon-like face with enormous glasses through which he slightly gobbled at you,

05:04.560 --> 05:11.080
and at first he didn't make very much impression, but as you talk to him the next thing in the evening

05:11.080 --> 05:17.780
you realize that he was an extraordinary wide originality and range and interest,

05:18.500 --> 05:24.120
and I looked to him very much and on a later book from an English I stayed with Jim and his wife, Julie,

05:24.280 --> 05:30.040
in an apartment near Washington, which was happily interested, but the most beautiful cast.

05:31.740 --> 05:39.640
And very shortly after that, in fact, they decided to leave America, come down and sit here,

05:40.440 --> 05:50.500
near Hindi, in the James Valley, and I think it's true to say Jim settled down most happily here and felt in a way,

05:50.680 --> 05:57.520
he'd at last found his spiritual home. But of course, once they moved to him, and I saw a lot more of them,

05:57.520 --> 06:03.580
and I realized more and more and more how very wide and the leader of it, curious,

06:03.980 --> 06:09.020
was the range of Jimblish's interest and abilities and attainment.

06:09.680 --> 06:18.540
Right apart from science fiction, he was a musical scholar, he was a great connoisseur of beer,

06:19.540 --> 06:25.040
and I'm quite certain that where he still alive, he'd be an ardent campaigner for the campaign for real ale.

06:26.080 --> 06:34.260
He was in fact a first great James Jones scholar, and unfortunately his premature death got short,

06:34.400 --> 06:38.960
his brain refutation in that field, he regularly attended to a band of his life,

06:39.120 --> 06:47.340
the James Jones conferences and the Congresses, and was taken with the utmost respect by the great James Jones scholars of today,

06:47.460 --> 06:54.480
like Richard Ehrman and Thys Hart, and was making contributions towards the strange and important

06:54.480 --> 07:00.200
field of literary scholarship. He educated as a scientist and he knew about physics and of course,

07:00.620 --> 07:05.920
about metaphysics as well, he was learned in the works of the 1912 team,

07:06.480 --> 07:16.660
but as a whole of what I might call near-fantasy literature, he was fascinated by black magic,

07:16.960 --> 07:21.960
witchcraft and white magic, though I hate the word, he didn't believe any of it,

07:21.960 --> 07:26.440
and indeed his premature death got short, there wouldn't be enough to pair the book,

07:27.320 --> 07:31.380
in that case a great big non-fiction history of witchcraft and black magic.

07:32.300 --> 07:39.000
Here, my only faint, plainly shadow of footnote immortality I got myself,

07:39.600 --> 07:45.020
it's a gem, because in Black Easter, I made the parents,

07:45.020 --> 07:51.860
you know my parents are happy to say, it's a little powerful, wise, white magician, part of Monty.

07:53.960 --> 07:59.180
All this time, when Jim and I were living in the Thames Valley near Harpston,

07:59.860 --> 08:09.480
I realized that Jim, who had previously suffered from cancer and the guarantee that this was pre-tropical,

08:09.480 --> 08:16.540
was again, I'm afraid, clearly moving into the closing years of his life,

08:17.140 --> 08:23.660
and he'd orchestrated for his last illness, was the most amiss friendliness and fortitude,

08:24.280 --> 08:29.480
and with a nail of all, with a rare pincher to scorn be with and enjoy his talk in his company,

08:30.380 --> 08:36.460
he was buried, and I can't imagine a more suitable place, he was buried in some cross church yard in Oxford,

08:37.500 --> 08:46.440
and the very heart of Oxford itself, and not very far from the prison, where his great-grandfather Roger Bacon

08:48.200 --> 08:51.380
had been incarcerated for a number of years.

08:52.400 --> 08:57.060
It wasn't always better fitting and suitable, resting place for him, the idealized there,

08:57.680 --> 09:04.740
and as he had buried, I thought to myself that his range of interest and his knowledge and his wisdom

09:04.740 --> 09:11.920
and the amount of instruction and pleasure he'd given to so many people entitled him to,

09:12.740 --> 09:15.560
to the title of Dr. Mirabilis.

09:17.200 --> 09:24.380
Now, tonight we have a number of, I mean, and very distinguished people, many from the world of 1906,

09:24.700 --> 09:30.440
and they're not in town, isn't that well, and they will all come here to pay tribute to Jim Bliss.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.260
Jim Bliss is life and his works.

09:34.780 --> 09:38.800
Now, first of all, I'm going to ask Peter Nichols of the Science Fiction Foundation,

09:39.820 --> 09:42.600
and his students, to join me on the platform.

09:44.840 --> 09:50.520
Now, Peter Nichols will, first of all, tell us what he remembers about Jim personally,

09:51.400 --> 09:57.240
and after that I will introduce and say something about what was to Jim,

09:57.240 --> 10:01.080
the most important novel of the whole lot, the one I was here with read.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.060
That's his novel about Roger Bacon, Dr. Mirabilis.

10:06.980 --> 10:12.180
Jim Brown, more than six months ago, which was long enough, it seems to me, to the period of mourning to be over,

10:12.940 --> 10:18.120
and the way I understand it, we're here tonight, some of his friends and very many of his readers,

10:18.660 --> 10:21.320
to talk about his achievements and the certain amount he was.

10:22.100 --> 10:27.580
But not only is he tall, but he's a great real nostalgia, because his books are still very much alive.

10:29.240 --> 10:34.160
Not many of the people here tonight have mourned him for very long, which has been an exception, in fact,

10:34.720 --> 10:37.920
because he didn't come to New England with his work, Judy, until 1968.

10:39.060 --> 10:43.320
And by that time, of course, he was going well established in the science fiction world,

10:44.300 --> 10:47.100
and had been publishing his stories close to 40 years.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.400
His first was in 1940, and it was only 19.

10:51.800 --> 10:57.440
You can get something of the flavor of Jim's early days in science fiction, including the period when he worked as a woodland,

10:57.540 --> 11:03.540
Scott Merritt of Slippery, as you see in New York, while reading the Domenites chapter in the book, Harry's Cartographers.

11:04.940 --> 11:11.100
In that chapter, Domenite spends a lot of time talking about the young SF fans of writers who lived in New York in the 40s,

11:11.100 --> 11:13.560
and founded a group called the Futurians.

11:14.280 --> 11:20.620
It included Domenite and SF, Dan Wilhelm, Robert Mines, Fred Paul, Judy Morrill, and Sarah Cumbeth.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.960
The very night tells it that there are rather shabby years.

11:24.800 --> 11:32.600
A group of rather only-mated and shy young people, gauche, lonely, and in several cases prone to disastrous first marriages,

11:33.420 --> 11:37.480
and all the things that emerges between the lines rather than in the of the night's article.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.300
Nothing thought seems to have endured the period. I don't think they did.

11:41.960 --> 11:47.820
And from the point of view of his development as a writer, the thought was more slow time for him,

11:47.900 --> 11:49.820
though he had other improvements to his credit.

11:50.880 --> 11:55.260
He went to fly a light plane, which is a fact that's still up in the library publicized about him.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.440
He got a science degree at Lutkes.

11:58.760 --> 12:04.560
He did very little work as a practicing scientist, and he dropped his postgraduate research to Columbia to become a writer.

12:05.820 --> 12:09.180
There's only stories for the first ten years or so you're not very distinguished.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.220
Jim was obviously a slow and careful loner of his craft, advancing it by imperceptible degrees,

12:16.720 --> 12:19.560
but there only really was this to be the momentum of a juggernaut.

12:20.520 --> 12:29.180
And only one to come together for him in the 50s helped as he was in middle with John W. Campbell's sympathetic assistance.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.660
Now, if you look at the chronology, it's interesting.

12:33.260 --> 12:39.580
The old key short stories, later to be collected as a novel of them come home, began to appear in 1950.

12:40.720 --> 12:47.980
The story of Bill Nstok, later part of the novel of Titan's daughter, appeared in 1952, as did surface tension.

12:48.720 --> 12:53.560
Later a part of Lee Searle's novel, The Sidley of Stars, which is really more of a collection of short stories,

12:54.140 --> 12:56.220
and also the novel of Jacob Evers in that year.

12:57.020 --> 13:02.620
A case of conscience, originally appeared in 1953, as did the story Common Time.

13:04.100 --> 13:10.760
The short story, Beep, a very good one, might have become part of Jim's most recently published novel, The Queen Cunks of Time,

13:11.300 --> 13:20.660
appeared in 1954, a very fine short story, A Work of Art, which features a future incarnation of his favourite composer, Richard Strauss, appeared in 1956.

13:22.000 --> 13:31.520
What come right here for anyone familiar with Jim's work is what the most amazing of which years, those years from 1950 to 1955 were,

13:32.020 --> 13:35.380
more especially as Jim was not a full time writer then.

13:35.760 --> 13:41.740
Indeed, he told me he used to write in the train commuting backwards and forwards to his job in New York, that's how a case of conscience got written.

13:43.020 --> 13:47.000
You can't help noticing too how life is here, when Jim Bacon was.

13:47.560 --> 13:54.220
He never met a piece of good prose going to waste. Again and again, the better stories re-emerged some years later,

13:55.100 --> 14:00.780
carefully and thoughtfully integrated into a mildew work, and often slightly rewritten in the process.

14:02.400 --> 14:07.820
I met Jim in 1971, by which time his literary career was by no means over,

14:08.700 --> 14:15.120
but had been badly slowed down by ear health worry, and it has to be said, a very severe writer's block.

14:16.420 --> 14:22.320
He never quite recovered from the cancer that first afflicts him in the mid-1960s, and of course his field was all founded,

14:22.460 --> 14:25.700
although it was another and quite different form of cancer that killed him.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.260
But in the 70s we did see the die-out of judgement, mid-summer century.

14:31.140 --> 14:38.780
And I think we ought to mention those briskly written Star Trek books, which Jim always referred to disparagingly as his bread and butter,

14:38.780 --> 14:44.220
for which we're very often written with a great deal of dash and skill, and gave a lot of people a lot of pleasure.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.980
He was certainly indirectly responsible for getting me my present job.

14:50.100 --> 14:54.460
I saw an advertisement in The Times which read, Wanted, Administrator for Science, Fiction, Foundation.

14:55.660 --> 15:02.720
I was convinced that it had to be a joke, or some sort of ghastly, hole-in-corner operation run by a bunch of eccentrics.

15:03.700 --> 15:09.040
Nonetheless, I did inquire, and when I learned that James Mish was one of the prominent founders of the organization,

15:09.380 --> 15:11.380
I instantly and enthusiastically applied.

15:12.660 --> 15:21.680
Because Jim, along with Alfred Bester, Fred Poe, and Sue Caldwell, was one of the four writers who had most kindred my enthusiasm for SF

15:21.680 --> 15:24.480
when I began to read it in the early 50s.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.740
And I've had no cause other since to change my mind.

15:27.740 --> 15:33.800
I still believe that those four men did more than any others to improve the standards of magazine SF

15:33.800 --> 15:39.200
and to widen its range at a period of time when that kind of reform was badly needed.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.380
I met Jim, soon after I got the job, and he became good friends.

15:45.440 --> 15:50.040
He was rather a shy man who, because of his illness, looked a little older than he was.

15:50.940 --> 15:52.400
Indeed, he looked rather frail.

15:53.120 --> 15:59.800
But after a while, as Charles intimated, he found a sort of consciousness of his expression rather than his physical appearance.

16:00.140 --> 16:04.020
He had very sharp eyes, which always looked very directly at you when he talked,

16:04.540 --> 16:08.260
and he had a grin which appeared and disappeared with startling suddenness.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.700
He was a serious man, but far from solemn.

16:12.560 --> 16:17.240
He had a strong mischievous streak, which could emerge in some moods as cutting irony,

16:17.740 --> 16:23.420
and even as a kind of wild capering like some wise fool, a jester out of Shakespeare.

16:24.900 --> 16:29.020
Otherwise, remember him singing in a cracked voice, a Strauss Aireen.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.780
It wasn't supposed to be sung by Clifton Mestra.

16:32.420 --> 16:37.580
He sang at first, as it normally was sung, and then as he thought it should be sung,

16:37.760 --> 16:39.260
in the second version, it was very much better.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.300
There was an extraordinary performance.

16:42.300 --> 16:46.640
A few years ago, he played the Wizard of Oz at a convention fancy dress competition,

16:47.080 --> 16:50.200
and he was splendidly, if unexpectedly, right to the part.

16:51.360 --> 16:55.860
He drank a fair amount, but in the several drinking sessions I had with him,

16:56.280 --> 16:58.640
he was always very much soberer than me at the end.

16:59.460 --> 17:01.080
In fact, his capacity was legendary.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.580
Even Harry Harrison had to admit defeat on one occasion.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.240
And that was only the day before Jim had to go into hospital to have half of a lung removed.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.680
He was amazing. He smoked heavily, too.

17:13.520 --> 17:19.520
I report these things one order to make Jim out to be some kind of wild rake, which he certainly was not.

17:20.320 --> 17:24.200
In fact, he was very much a gentleman in the old fashioned and best sense of that word.

17:25.380 --> 17:30.660
I really want to stress the paradox that Jim, behind what was often quite literally a smokescreen,

17:31.280 --> 17:34.760
was a very sober man indeed. His passions were intellectual.

17:35.700 --> 17:39.640
At a party he wasn't enjoying, he could look polite but bored for hours,

17:39.840 --> 17:43.100
or silently drift away like one of the cats that he so much loved.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.720
But when the talk got good, you couldn't get Jim to go to bed.

17:47.260 --> 17:50.160
He'd talk until the sun rose again in the morning, and often did,

17:50.500 --> 17:54.020
and less forced as usual to give up by the lesser stamina of others.

17:55.060 --> 17:58.960
He'd talk about general relativity, James Joyce, politics, mediaeval,

17:59.080 --> 18:02.520
scholasticism, science fiction, poetry, music, cabardages, or kings.

18:03.180 --> 18:09.580
In fact, Jim was a wholly traditional scholar, who seldom had the opportunity to practice his scholarship,

18:09.760 --> 18:14.880
except in his fiction, where sometimes he used to downright wickedly and inappropriately,

18:15.740 --> 18:21.700
as in the Star Trek novel Spock Must Die, where the secret intergalactic communications code

18:21.700 --> 18:25.420
is based with insane irrelevance and the Josian language of film becomes weak.

18:27.980 --> 18:31.840
I'm not going to talk about Jim's science fiction. I'll move up to Mark Abner, who's coming on later,

18:32.640 --> 18:34.560
beyond saying that he was an important pioneer.

18:35.700 --> 18:40.320
He was one of the very few members of his generation who continuously and consciously endeavored,

18:40.440 --> 18:44.380
with a great deal of success, to raise the intellectual standards of SF,

18:44.800 --> 18:48.620
to sharpen its scientific accuracy, and to increase, especially,

18:48.860 --> 18:51.120
the range and depth of its metaphysical speculation.

18:52.520 --> 18:56.440
I will to finish by saying a few words about the book of Jim's of our most value,

18:57.100 --> 19:03.040
Dr. Mirabilis, which he began to write in the late 50s, while he was becoming increasingly a sick man,

19:03.860 --> 19:06.660
which was finally published after many difficulties in 1965.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.960
My friendship with Jim dates for safety from the time of our first meeting,

19:12.720 --> 19:18.000
when I told him that Dr. Mirabilis was my favorite of all his novels, and he was quite delighted.

19:19.240 --> 19:24.720
I know now that I didn't know then, it was of all his books, it was the one to which he had the most passionate commitment,

19:25.500 --> 19:27.700
and yet, it hasn't ever been very popular.

19:28.640 --> 19:33.940
He used to complain, in fact, about the popularity of his much-unapologized short story, surface tension.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.860
He couldn't see why it was so successful, when, for example, Dr. Mirabilis was not.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.120
I know why, but it's very obvious.

19:42.640 --> 19:47.960
But just the same, I think that Dr. Mirabilis is the closest thing to a great novel with Jim Mirabilis.

19:48.900 --> 19:52.000
I actually think it is a great novel, it's not a word you use readily,

19:52.640 --> 19:55.460
but despite its flaws, some of which are obvious, it's a great novel,

19:56.040 --> 20:00.040
and I think that very slowly it will come to be seen as a classic historical novel.

20:01.160 --> 20:06.960
If you don't know it, it's a fictional biography of the 13th century film-age and scientist, Roger Bacon.

20:08.220 --> 20:12.460
As Jim says in the introduction, there's so little known about the facts of Bacon's life,

20:13.120 --> 20:17.640
that this book is in fact a fiction, rather than a biography, but what a fiction.

20:18.920 --> 20:22.700
The reason why it will never become very popular is that it's very difficult,

20:23.520 --> 20:26.880
and the reason why it's difficult is also the reason why it's great.

20:27.880 --> 20:33.640
The book undertakes a conceptual loop, unlike anything else I've ever come across in historical fiction.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.640
Let me explain.

20:37.100 --> 20:41.940
In the most popular kind of historical fiction, you get an adventure story,

20:42.080 --> 20:46.540
staged in an imaginary past, with some colourful stage settings, some exotic clothes,

20:47.260 --> 20:48.420
and perhaps some swordplay.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.380
The psychology, however, is contemporary.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.160
The characters behave in a way that is familiar to modern readers,

20:55.900 --> 20:59.040
acting on letters with which the modern reader can easily identify,

20:59.040 --> 21:02.580
and this, by the way, is usually also true of science fiction.

21:03.920 --> 21:08.060
A much better kind of historical novel, such as those written by Arthur Bacon,

21:09.480 --> 21:13.360
who, by the way, was among the Baron Odus, one of the two leaders, I believe,

21:13.620 --> 21:16.360
who advised Papers to buy Dr. Neublas in the first place.

21:17.720 --> 21:22.640
Bacon always strolled to accuracy, not only at historical events and plays in speech,

21:23.460 --> 21:25.900
but also at the accuracy of psychology and feeling.

21:26.540 --> 21:32.800
Duggan, for example, understood very well that it was useless trying to use later concepts of romantic love

21:32.800 --> 21:36.340
in dealing with, say, the sexual life of the mangrove sex and king.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.080
Which went one step further?

21:40.560 --> 21:43.900
In Dr. Neublas, he goes deeper than questions of dress or setting,

21:44.380 --> 21:46.780
or even psychological and physical motivation.

21:47.780 --> 21:52.800
He tries to move the reader into understanding how, 700 years ago,

21:52.800 --> 21:57.060
the farthest man of the age envisaged the nature of the universe.

21:57.680 --> 22:02.260
He takes this, that is, directly into questions of philosophy and metaphysics.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.800
And these aren't irrelevant, hard-barre questions, as he shows.

22:07.980 --> 22:11.500
The teachings of the Church at that time and the nature of God and His creation

22:12.060 --> 22:16.180
had a quite direct effect on what could or could not happen in everyday life.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.740
There was a certain kind of thinking, for example,

22:19.740 --> 22:25.880
that we would saw what we now think of as being experimental science as unnecessary or even evil,

22:26.600 --> 22:29.300
hence the slowness of advances in medicine, for instance.

22:30.800 --> 22:35.160
Dr. Neublas is an effect, a novel, about the creation of science.

22:36.280 --> 22:41.200
The word science, or slentia, existed then, but it meant something quite different.

22:42.880 --> 22:47.980
Bacon, along with Peter Peregrine and some other figures such as Don Skaters and William Mavocan,

22:47.980 --> 22:52.580
who don't come into Bush's book because they were both born when Webster Bacon was quite an old man.

22:54.180 --> 22:57.720
These figures didn't invent experimental science per se,

22:58.000 --> 23:02.400
because they always existed in some form or another, sometimes called craft,

23:03.220 --> 23:05.120
sometimes magic and sometimes alchemy.

23:05.780 --> 23:11.360
Now, what was known to be especially Bacon was to invent a world thinking about the universe,

23:11.560 --> 23:17.260
which gave an intellectual shape, a method of organization, and a conceptual framework,

23:17.260 --> 23:24.480
within which experimental science could become more than a series of randomly collated facts and findings.

23:25.040 --> 23:31.660
And it's very typical of Jim that he chose to write on the conceptual organizer rather than the experimenter.

23:32.420 --> 23:37.460
It literally closed down that aspect of the Bacon myth that stresses his experimental work.

23:38.540 --> 23:43.080
Indeed, he points out that a larger part of Bacon's experiments were carefully repetitive testing,

23:43.080 --> 23:48.100
as the earlier experiments, many of them reported in Aristotle, rather than original work.

23:49.340 --> 23:54.280
He does, however, allow that part of the myth, which emits to Bacon's invention of gunpowder,

23:54.580 --> 23:56.020
he allows that to be possibly true.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.700
Well, interestingly, he puts the invention down to a vision, which I think would be led to us in a minute,

24:01.440 --> 24:04.860
after all gunpowder had been previously known in China and in the Middle East.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.500
We all have been calling it a new discovery.

24:08.840 --> 24:14.480
Something you may be familiar with, a third-rate book called The History of Western Philosophy, written by Bertrand Wessel.

24:15.860 --> 24:16.780
Wessel comments,

24:18.020 --> 24:21.760
Bacon was not to my mind so scientific as is sometimes thought.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.780
And the instance is the prior existence of gunpowder as an example of what he means.

24:27.660 --> 24:29.360
The myth seems stupid in this.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.820
Dr. Moabless is an amazingly fit of scholarship in thought,

24:34.040 --> 24:39.760
to a man with absolutely no formal trunnion philosophy, very little trunnion in the history of science,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.300
and at the time he began writing it, no Latin.

24:43.660 --> 24:48.020
And yet, Wessel thought the essence of Bacon's work, which Bertrand Wessel could not see.

24:49.140 --> 24:54.480
Wessel did this in part by putting himself in command of the obscure and difficult jargon of the medieval schoolmen,

24:55.360 --> 24:56.560
and understanding it.

24:57.460 --> 25:01.180
He's even over to show in the most amazing single passage of the book,

25:02.040 --> 25:05.780
that when Bacon wrote a lot, it was then called The Multiplication of Species,

25:06.520 --> 25:08.760
he was really talking about the propagation of force.

25:10.800 --> 25:17.860
In this work, Bacon made the conceptual leap forward which carried him up to envisaging a space-time continuum in the 13th century,

25:18.440 --> 25:19.980
a magical framework of the universe,

25:21.160 --> 25:24.620
in fact, a thinking which Bertrand would learn from his materialist activity.

25:25.660 --> 25:27.760
To me, the whole book is absolutely gripping.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.600
I granted difficulty,

25:30.440 --> 25:34.760
but the difficulty is so much a part of the performance that nobody could surely regret it.

25:35.580 --> 25:40.080
And in effect, this difficulty stems from the relation between the word and the thing.

25:41.180 --> 25:42.780
It isn't only a question of vocabulary,

25:43.800 --> 25:46.640
it's a question of the world picture which entail that vocabulary.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.500
Wessel seduces us into the money of the man,

25:51.780 --> 26:00.340
most notably when he gives us in full detail the own examination in which Roger Bacon wins his secular master of arts at the University of Paris.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.440
I skip a bit here, many of them.

26:05.900 --> 26:11.480
The only comparison I can think of for Jim's book is women golden with the inheritors,

26:12.100 --> 26:14.680
which is also a novel about conceptual breakthrough,

26:15.240 --> 26:16.560
and also a difficult novel,

26:16.560 --> 26:18.860
as such novels must always be,

26:19.660 --> 26:24.500
because the attempt is to create a truly alien mode of thought in modern language,

26:25.240 --> 26:28.240
a language which is itself molded by the way we think.

26:29.300 --> 26:34.880
The inheritors by golden tells of neolithic men beginning to conceptualize their universe,

26:35.660 --> 26:37.820
in a sense what the marvelous does the same,

26:38.500 --> 26:40.020
only though alarmingly,

26:40.260 --> 26:42.720
in that its period is so worth being close to our own.

26:44.040 --> 26:48.020
There is a popular and sentimental view that humanity doesn't really change much,

26:48.200 --> 26:51.760
and that we're all subject to the same kinds of feelings, the same ways of thinking,

26:51.860 --> 26:53.400
and have been for thousands of years,

26:54.640 --> 26:56.800
partly true, but not wholly true.

26:57.780 --> 27:03.620
Reading Dr. Meeabless is an admirable collective for those who take a sentimental view about the continuity of history.

27:05.060 --> 27:07.880
It is of course SF as well as very historical fiction.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.980
Conceptual breakthrough has always been the basic subject of SF,

27:12.900 --> 27:17.420
and it's present as much in Dr. Meeabless's In The Seedling Stars, more so in a way.

27:18.360 --> 27:23.100
Certainly, if the way we think changes as much in the next 700 years,

27:23.500 --> 27:25.840
as this shows them to have changed in the last 700,

27:27.280 --> 27:31.020
and according to Alvin Totler, the weight of change is itself accelerating,

27:31.840 --> 27:35.000
then most science fiction set in the future is fatuously limited,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.420
simply in creating worlds which are too much like our own.

27:39.980 --> 27:43.060
Finally, Roger Bacon must be said is James Bish,

27:44.460 --> 27:47.460
and therefore all the more admirable for nothing when to the heroic.

27:48.720 --> 27:53.140
He is shown to be a fumbling, thick-skinned, and awkward man in human relations,

27:53.960 --> 27:55.620
a slow and repetitive thinker,

27:56.520 --> 27:59.400
a man who doesn't always realize the importance of his own ideas,

28:00.520 --> 28:03.280
a man obsessed by partly useless activity,

28:03.960 --> 28:07.240
such as a kind of encyclopedic finalist without opinions,

28:07.500 --> 28:11.080
such as might be expected from an accountant rather than a great thinker.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.200
Bacon is shown to be very much a man of his time,

28:14.760 --> 28:18.620
whose acts of moral courage are occasionally balanced by acts of moral cowardice.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.080
I don't mean that Roger Bacon is modeled on the author.

28:22.980 --> 28:26.920
I do mean that the author was obviously enormously attracted by the achievements

28:26.920 --> 28:29.500
and even the presumptive personality of Bacon,

28:30.040 --> 28:34.060
and therefore much to his credit that he did not sentimentalize the man

28:34.060 --> 28:37.860
whom he must surely have seen as a kind of medieval alter ego.

28:38.920 --> 28:43.380
Anyone who knew Jim must necessarily be especially moved by his account of Roger,

28:44.140 --> 28:46.680
because there were so many traces of the author there,

28:47.560 --> 28:50.100
rigorously distanced throughout a trace of self-indulgence.

28:51.180 --> 28:53.200
I first read the book many before I met Jim,

28:53.940 --> 28:57.160
and even then I knew as to be one of the most exceptional novels I'd ever read.

28:58.620 --> 29:03.900
Now after it was written, Jim made it retrospectively the first part of the trilogy,

29:04.320 --> 29:06.980
whose overall title is After Such Knowledge.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.580
Bruce himself described the theme of the trilogy as,

29:12.860 --> 29:14.580
is the desire for secular knowledge,

29:15.460 --> 29:17.260
let alone the acquisition and lucidate,

29:17.520 --> 29:21.260
and misuse of the mind, and perhaps even actively evil.

29:22.900 --> 29:25.840
Certainly this film plays a prominent role in Dock and the Rivaless,

29:25.840 --> 29:29.580
and also in Black Easter, The Diath of Judgment and Case of Conscience,

29:29.780 --> 29:30.820
the other books in the series.

29:32.360 --> 29:36.300
The title After Such Knowledge comes from T. S. Eliot's poem, Juantium,

29:37.160 --> 29:40.920
and I read the lines because they sound like wishes seen beautifully

29:40.920 --> 29:44.100
and in a more lucid and symbolic way than he does himself,

29:44.660 --> 29:46.200
they're from the third stanza of the poem.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.640
After Such Knowledge, What Forgiveness?

29:51.580 --> 29:55.200
Think now, history has many cunning passages,

29:55.900 --> 29:57.980
contrived corridors and issues,

29:58.700 --> 30:01.020
deceives with a whispering ambitions,

30:02.080 --> 30:03.680
guides us by vanities.

30:04.360 --> 30:08.000
Think now, she gives when our attention is distracted,

30:08.820 --> 30:12.300
and what she gives, gives with such subtle confusions

30:12.300 --> 30:14.820
that the giving famishes the craving.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.180
Gives too late what's not belated,

30:18.180 --> 30:23.160
or is still believed in memory only, reconsidered passion.

30:24.020 --> 30:29.440
Gives too soon into recans what thought can be dispensed with

30:29.440 --> 30:31.800
till the refusal propagates a fear.

30:32.480 --> 30:36.320
Think, now the fear, no courage, serves us.

30:37.840 --> 30:42.660
Thus the musings stone-sad and ironical of T. S. Eliot's Old Man.

30:43.740 --> 30:46.560
There are thoughts that can readily be found in much of Bush also,

30:47.120 --> 30:50.400
but my own theory is that he thought the girl in yours worth the candle.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.660
He knew the dangers of the acquisition of knowledge,

30:54.140 --> 30:57.160
the guilt that goes evading the apple, but he loved it anyway.

30:58.220 --> 31:00.900
Roger Bacon dreams at one point, which would be led to,

31:00.980 --> 31:03.040
of modern war, of Armageddon.

31:04.160 --> 31:07.060
And he understands the vision as a possible result of his work,

31:07.800 --> 31:10.140
but the sheer intellectual passion and devotion,

31:10.660 --> 31:13.160
even the love with which he throws himself into the law,

31:13.160 --> 31:14.340
and the need to spot the dangers,

31:15.220 --> 31:18.600
shows clearly enough that the emotional commitment of the orphan married.

31:19.380 --> 31:21.120
Even if he was intimately,

31:21.680 --> 31:24.860
and he was placing his status as quickly as possible away from knowledge,

31:25.500 --> 31:27.780
and back to the innocent joys of the original garden,

31:28.960 --> 31:30.740
we might have shown the fear of man,

31:31.120 --> 31:33.380
that Bishop Mast was ready to make the best of it,

31:33.840 --> 31:36.920
to risk that macphugiveness, which in his case, of course,

31:37.040 --> 31:38.120
is only meddling in God.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.040
And that's most of all.

31:40.040 --> 31:43.680
I'd like to say this is rather an academic sort of introduction for you,

31:43.780 --> 31:46.160
but I don't apologise because he himself

31:46.800 --> 31:50.760
was primarily an academic sort of man in the very best sense.

31:51.780 --> 31:53.560
He never talks down or let down.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.220
He is seen and realized that the reader or listener

31:56.220 --> 31:57.780
would be as intelligent as himself.

31:58.740 --> 32:00.660
I appreciated the compliment as his friend,

32:00.900 --> 32:03.880
and I'm sure you already did too, whether it was his friends or readers.

32:04.740 --> 32:06.940
I shouldn't distinguish between friends and readers.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.260
I thought myself to be his friend before I'd run with him,

32:10.440 --> 32:12.200
and I know that many others thought the same.

32:13.020 --> 32:17.260
Now I understand that we'll read the next track from Duncan O'Robble this.

32:20.620 --> 32:21.500
All right.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.180
Roger Bacon, still a young man,

32:25.340 --> 32:26.740
but already making a name for himself,

32:26.920 --> 32:29.320
goes to Paris University in the hope of being allowed to teach

32:29.320 --> 32:30.760
our aesthetic philosophy then.

32:31.660 --> 32:33.940
This, of course, is Paris in the 13th century.

32:33.940 --> 32:37.620
A mixture of filth and finery, reason and bigotry,

32:38.080 --> 32:40.260
the whole of disease and disputation scholars.

32:41.140 --> 32:43.820
University is burdened with ages-old philosophies,

32:44.240 --> 32:46.800
aimlessly re-quoted and reinterpreted by commentators.

32:47.660 --> 32:50.940
In this unlikely place, Bacon discovers a group of proto-scientists,

32:51.480 --> 32:54.100
and attends one of their clandestine alchemical matinees.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.860
However, Matamars, Maters, go awry,

32:58.640 --> 33:01.780
and most of those persons are rendered unconscious by the fumes from one of the experiments.

33:02.740 --> 33:05.940
Bacon eventually attends with him that night, still feeling ill,

33:06.540 --> 33:09.520
and begins to reread his copy of The Secret of Secrets,

33:09.920 --> 33:12.220
a letter to Alexander the Great from his teacher, Aristotle.

33:13.500 --> 33:17.500
In it, are descriptions of the means whereby certain elements may be attained,

33:18.200 --> 33:20.720
including personal, political, and military power.

33:21.740 --> 33:23.580
What we would recognize as formulae.

33:24.380 --> 33:25.840
Bacon reflects on what he has read,

33:26.540 --> 33:29.560
and gradually the voice of his inner self begins to debate with him,

33:29.560 --> 33:32.320
that prefaces one of the major crises in his life.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.500
Yet these matters, and the most secret of secrets of this kind,

33:38.900 --> 33:40.920
have always hidden from the rank and file of philosophers,

33:41.900 --> 33:44.580
and particularly so often, then began to abuse science,

33:45.200 --> 33:48.940
telling to evil what God granted in full measure for the safety and advantage of man.

33:49.920 --> 33:53.500
Until he should strive that the wonderful and ineffable utility

33:53.500 --> 33:55.760
and splendor of experimental science may appear,

33:55.760 --> 34:00.180
and the pathway of a seantier universalist be again opened.

34:01.500 --> 34:02.780
And that's by being,

34:03.860 --> 34:04.360
Downhole!

34:05.280 --> 34:05.980
Lord, you shouted.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.740
He swallowed and resumed his perch on the stool.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.420
What a doubt, dower, he said quietly.

34:14.600 --> 34:18.120
I demand that answer, in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord.

34:19.720 --> 34:21.140
For a while there was no answer,

34:22.220 --> 34:24.780
and there had been noted within the darkness beyond the candle flame

34:24.780 --> 34:26.820
there were strange and lawless patches of color,

34:27.360 --> 34:28.320
pulsing and delusive.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.980
Moreover, his givingness was worse.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.440
Was that still a sweet vitriol,

34:33.920 --> 34:36.000
or was he in truth working too long as willing?

34:36.720 --> 34:38.800
I am the raven of Elias.

34:40.660 --> 34:42.420
That is blasphemous and untrue.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.880
Hacharski, tell me who thou art.

34:47.320 --> 34:48.180
I am the man.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.100
What man is this?

34:51.020 --> 34:53.380
Tell me thy signification, else I'll exorcise thee straight.

34:54.780 --> 34:55.780
Thou art the man.

34:57.960 --> 34:58.740
Speak on.

35:00.140 --> 35:04.640
Thou art the man shall bring back into the world the seantier universalist.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.720
Thou shalt make a written edifice unto the glory of thy Lord.

35:09.880 --> 35:12.920
All the help I shall give thee, that be required.

35:14.800 --> 35:15.200
How?

35:16.940 --> 35:19.380
As food brought unto Elias in the desert,

35:19.380 --> 35:21.900
thy nativeness shall touch heaven,

35:22.480 --> 35:26.600
and on its proudly written knowledge is power.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.260
These cadences were putting into sleep.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.620
Almost he failed to see the trap,

35:32.840 --> 35:35.620
the self-same trap into which the builders of Babel had fallen.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.840
Nay, moral philosophy is the pinnacle

35:40.380 --> 35:42.360
for the ways nothing can touch heaven.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.940
How dost thou know, O Jehovah's...

35:47.640 --> 35:50.380
For by the light of knowledge the Church of God is governed.

35:51.220 --> 35:53.340
The common work for the faithful is regulated.

35:54.140 --> 35:56.040
The conversion of unbelievers is secured,

35:56.500 --> 35:58.280
and those who persist in their malice

35:58.940 --> 36:01.960
can be held in check by the excellence of knowledge.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.400
So that they may be driven off from the borders of the Church

36:05.400 --> 36:07.940
in a better way than by the shedding of Christian blood.

36:10.100 --> 36:13.340
And this is the meaning of that saying, knowledge is power.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.720
All matters requiring the guidance of knowledge

36:16.720 --> 36:18.480
are reduced to these four heads,

36:18.740 --> 36:21.340
and no more, the self-same.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.840
It is strange and horrifying to hear a discourse

36:24.840 --> 36:26.440
when these matters weighty and unusual

36:26.440 --> 36:30.540
in that same, remote, bodyless, tumours wine.

36:31.220 --> 36:33.260
So it's saying only to an ear itself,

36:34.540 --> 36:37.020
the pages of the secrets of secrets wavered

36:37.020 --> 36:39.720
and blared before him, and he closed the book.

36:40.340 --> 36:41.700
He could think of nothing else to ask.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.180
But, he was suspended in ecstasy of disbelief.

36:46.180 --> 36:49.480
In that emptiness, the self sang suddenly.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.340
Time is...

36:53.340 --> 36:55.000
Yes, Lord Jesus,

36:55.680 --> 36:57.560
it is a subject of notion,

36:58.640 --> 36:59.520
but I don't.

37:00.180 --> 37:01.880
Time was...

37:01.880 --> 37:02.820
the same was self.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.720
Time was...

37:05.720 --> 37:06.780
behind the voice of music,

37:06.920 --> 37:09.140
what you seem to hear in this mirroring of echoes.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.140
He's just a very bad guy, he used to be a baby,

37:12.860 --> 37:13.740
he said, stunning.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.520
But the words came forth,

37:17.200 --> 37:18.480
over the middle slurred.

37:19.680 --> 37:22.380
Where I know that time is single and linear,

37:22.980 --> 37:25.400
and given up one age belonging to all ages.

37:26.260 --> 37:27.780
This is the necessary conclusion,

37:28.700 --> 37:31.000
doubted by no one skilled his philosophy.

37:31.860 --> 37:34.800
No easy to pose to sacred writers,

37:35.040 --> 37:35.820
that there's an adopter,

37:35.820 --> 37:38.340
but the agreement with every one,

37:38.760 --> 37:40.980
who tries to find his vaccine with me?

37:42.140 --> 37:42.260
Who?

37:44.380 --> 37:45.140
The moment home,

37:46.080 --> 37:47.340
points to the candle flame,

37:47.560 --> 37:48.660
but doubt fell down,

37:48.780 --> 37:49.640
like a fisherman's float,

37:49.820 --> 37:50.440
lure the bubbles.

37:51.800 --> 37:52.940
When the self spoke again,

37:53.200 --> 37:55.240
its distant sign of displace was as terrible

37:55.240 --> 37:57.040
as the strokes of a gong of bars.

37:58.540 --> 38:00.200
Time is past!

38:01.360 --> 38:02.700
The candle went out.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.020
When from the darkness,

38:05.300 --> 38:06.740
their loads rank upon rank

38:06.740 --> 38:08.600
of armored men with thousand faces,

38:08.900 --> 38:09.840
and the faces were sheep,

38:10.400 --> 38:12.120
and the faces of demons too bright

38:12.120 --> 38:13.460
in their chain to look upon,

38:13.620 --> 38:14.900
masked under the invisible sun,

38:15.540 --> 38:17.140
passing in their thousands as men

38:17.140 --> 38:19.040
who marched to the last great engagement.

38:20.120 --> 38:22.220
And with them, thousands on horseback,

38:22.780 --> 38:24.940
and more unanimals not yet seen in the world,

38:25.680 --> 38:27.520
and many bearing strange engines,

38:28.180 --> 38:29.880
and that their heads was anti-Christ,

38:30.640 --> 38:31.820
yet in a trotling,

38:32.580 --> 38:34.100
always terrible post-tranquil,

38:34.940 --> 38:36.260
so that each man was no bigger

38:36.260 --> 38:37.000
than a grain of millet,

38:38.080 --> 38:39.520
and that even this Emmett army

38:39.520 --> 38:40.760
was turned out of sight,

38:41.380 --> 38:43.660
as an image vanishes when the glass is turned,

38:44.500 --> 38:45.740
and north left behind,

38:45.980 --> 38:47.700
for the white cats of some torrent,

38:48.220 --> 38:49.700
stretching to the far horizon,

38:49.700 --> 38:50.980
as if one looked in vain

38:50.980 --> 38:52.820
across a straight up coming invader.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.780
Things moved like levires

38:55.780 --> 38:56.900
beneath the waters,

38:57.840 --> 38:59.160
with the rangeens,

38:59.680 --> 39:00.420
and the women in them,

39:01.240 --> 39:02.440
and the dragons in the air

39:02.440 --> 39:03.880
like the dragons of the Ethiopians,

39:04.020 --> 39:05.160
yet there were men in them,

39:05.600 --> 39:07.300
and there were males under the earth,

39:07.360 --> 39:08.480
and men were the men,

39:08.640 --> 39:10.520
all in men with terrible circumstances,

39:11.380 --> 39:13.000
and one wearing a cow cane

39:13.000 --> 39:14.160
and stoned upon a headlamp

39:14.160 --> 39:15.200
about the white waters,

39:15.980 --> 39:17.160
and how about such glasses

39:17.160 --> 39:18.360
that mirrors were necessary

39:18.360 --> 39:19.720
to show forth these things,

39:20.720 --> 39:21.740
and the mirrors turned,

39:22.500 --> 39:23.820
and there across the white waters

39:23.820 --> 39:25.000
was the self-sane army

39:25.000 --> 39:25.880
both close again,

39:26.540 --> 39:28.140
yet every now, yet now,

39:28.320 --> 39:30.100
every man was as great as a giant

39:30.100 --> 39:30.940
across that distance,

39:31.620 --> 39:32.980
so that every link in the mail

39:32.980 --> 39:33.680
could be counted,

39:34.720 --> 39:35.840
and the mirrors moved,

39:36.020 --> 39:36.860
and the head of him,

39:36.980 --> 39:38.520
the cowl, appeared in the air

39:38.520 --> 39:39.280
above the army,

39:39.940 --> 39:41.280
greater than any of they,

39:41.880 --> 39:42.900
and verming as it were,

39:43.060 --> 39:44.060
the flowers said a furnace,

39:45.080 --> 39:45.980
yet was not there,

39:47.080 --> 39:47.920
and many of those giants

39:47.920 --> 39:48.840
threw down their engines

39:48.840 --> 39:49.640
at war and fled,

39:50.160 --> 39:51.060
yet the host came on,

39:51.900 --> 39:52.780
and he made in the air

39:52.780 --> 39:53.600
certain compositions

39:53.600 --> 39:54.500
which a man might know

39:54.500 --> 39:55.480
only by smelling them,

39:56.060 --> 39:56.860
or not at all.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.060
But on came that inexhaustible host,

40:00.640 --> 40:02.180
and that their head was anti-Christ,

40:03.300 --> 40:04.160
and he and the cowl

40:04.160 --> 40:05.000
held out his hand

40:05.000 --> 40:05.860
under the white waters,

40:06.640 --> 40:07.160
and he was farming

40:07.160 --> 40:08.160
with certain crystals

40:08.160 --> 40:09.000
like salt painter

40:09.000 --> 40:09.720
for the Dunheap,

40:10.440 --> 40:11.680
and he wrapped the crystals

40:11.680 --> 40:12.820
in a scrap of parchment

40:12.820 --> 40:14.060
without any writing on it,

40:14.680 --> 40:15.680
and cast it into the wind

40:15.680 --> 40:16.160
and crying,

40:16.840 --> 40:18.880
whoop-a-roop-a-roop-a-roop-a-roop-a-roop-a-roop-a-roop,

40:18.900 --> 40:19.780
come here to us,

40:19.880 --> 40:21.000
more like a do-me-up,

40:21.360 --> 40:22.440
hip-side a cop-son,

40:23.200 --> 40:24.200
where I told that army

40:24.200 --> 40:25.000
was seen to fall

40:25.000 --> 40:26.460
in a single flash of lightning,

40:27.100 --> 40:28.460
and when the roar was such sharp

40:28.460 --> 40:29.640
thunder that the cowl flew

40:29.640 --> 40:30.540
from the skull of him

40:30.540 --> 40:31.200
that it cried out,

40:32.120 --> 40:33.760
and he fell dwindling away

40:33.760 --> 40:35.940
to nothing like an ever-bamming lamp

40:35.940 --> 40:37.180
cast into the sea.

40:39.220 --> 40:40.720
After that, for a long time,

40:41.240 --> 40:43.100
it was darkness and silence,

40:44.120 --> 40:45.280
but it was not the nothingness

40:45.280 --> 40:47.280
of sleep in which the consciousness

40:47.280 --> 40:48.940
of time itself was obliterated.

40:49.880 --> 40:50.540
So, in an instant,

40:50.780 --> 40:51.400
the night is gone

40:51.400 --> 40:52.780
that wakeful men could rise full.

40:53.840 --> 40:54.760
Time passed,

40:55.480 --> 40:56.740
but what had been smarted

40:57.280 --> 40:58.460
and that sable silence

40:58.460 --> 40:59.300
could not be known,

41:00.160 --> 41:02.220
nor words spoken reached the ears,

41:03.080 --> 41:04.600
nor any touch penetrated.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.140
Then he mourned,

41:07.740 --> 41:08.080
and heard,

41:09.040 --> 41:10.380
and confused glint past

41:10.380 --> 41:11.640
before his closed glids.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.360
And while it was gone,

41:13.360 --> 41:14.840
in any of the darkness,

41:15.060 --> 41:15.820
he almost awoke,

41:16.460 --> 41:17.980
drawing a breath for me to discover

41:17.980 --> 41:19.420
that he could hardly breathe,

41:20.320 --> 41:21.620
and when he was soaked in sweat,

41:22.500 --> 41:23.840
someone mourned near him,

41:24.500 --> 41:25.340
and there was an answer.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.240
He understood neither.

41:28.820 --> 41:29.520
Now, however,

41:30.560 --> 41:31.580
he could fall into truth.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.660
Now, while at Magadladen,

41:35.780 --> 41:36.700
and Richard Cutter,

41:36.900 --> 41:38.620
drawn me here on the platform,

41:38.980 --> 41:40.640
where there was a short musical interval,

41:40.640 --> 41:44.860
that reminded us of Jim's very great devotion to music,

41:45.160 --> 41:46.680
and his great interest in music,

41:46.740 --> 41:48.280
which was of very scholarly interest.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.200
First of all,

41:50.760 --> 41:52.080
we play a short extract

41:52.080 --> 41:54.060
from a very rarely performed opera

41:54.060 --> 41:55.480
by Bavitra Strauss,

41:55.780 --> 41:56.860
the Egyptian heroine,

41:56.920 --> 41:58.860
which was Jim's favorite opera.

41:59.960 --> 42:00.680
And after that,

42:00.760 --> 42:01.420
there will be a record

42:01.420 --> 42:03.740
which is of even greater rarity,

42:04.520 --> 42:07.300
and of very considerable personal interest.

43:40.640 --> 44:10.600
The film is a short film

44:10.600 --> 44:10.620
where the film was shot in the city of Magadladen,

44:17.320 --> 44:31.860
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

44:31.860 --> 44:32.020
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

44:32.020 --> 44:34.280
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

44:34.280 --> 44:38.540
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

44:38.560 --> 44:40.420
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

44:40.420 --> 45:07.240
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:07.240 --> 45:07.300
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:07.300 --> 45:07.500
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:07.500 --> 45:08.380
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:08.380 --> 45:09.060
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:09.060 --> 45:10.400
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:10.400 --> 45:32.580
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:32.580 --> 45:32.860
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:32.860 --> 45:32.960
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:32.960 --> 45:34.600
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:35.780 --> 45:39.300
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:39.300 --> 45:40.380
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:40.380 --> 45:49.340
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:54.980 --> 45:58.220
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

45:58.220 --> 46:00.920
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

46:00.920 --> 46:00.980
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

46:00.980 --> 46:02.620
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

46:02.620 --> 46:06.860
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

46:06.860 --> 46:10.200
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

46:10.200 --> 46:10.360
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

46:10.360 --> 46:40.340
and it was shot in the city of Magadladen,

46:40.340 --> 46:43.160
In the 1940s, James Blosch and some friends

46:43.900 --> 46:46.400
started to build a small record company,

46:46.640 --> 46:47.520
Van Ralf Records,

46:48.400 --> 46:50.340
and this record, the one they're going to hear now,

46:50.520 --> 46:52.580
is the very first record they ever made.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.840
It's the Tecateur of Guatemala

46:54.840 --> 46:57.720
by a son, Son Wilkins, tellin',

46:57.720 --> 46:59.400
and the player needs to go to Munich.

48:10.340 --> 48:40.320
The Tecateur of Guatemala

48:40.320 --> 49:10.300
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:19.720 --> 49:21.760
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:21.760 --> 49:22.460
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:22.460 --> 49:22.740
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:22.740 --> 49:23.360
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:23.360 --> 49:24.740
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:24.740 --> 49:25.260
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:25.260 --> 49:26.440
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:26.440 --> 49:26.620
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:26.620 --> 49:27.180
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:27.180 --> 49:27.700
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:27.700 --> 49:28.520
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:28.520 --> 49:30.520
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:30.520 --> 49:34.140
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:39.560 --> 49:40.000
The Tecateur of Guatemala

49:40.000 --> 49:41.140
Now, not without that,

49:41.240 --> 49:42.540
I think we should kind of joint me.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.620
Now, now, now, I'm going to talk principally

49:45.620 --> 49:47.280
about Jim Beasch as a scientist

49:48.380 --> 49:49.780
and Richard Kuyper,

49:49.820 --> 49:51.540
maybe for one of his best men

49:51.540 --> 49:53.300
and Mr Mark Woodworks,

49:54.160 --> 49:55.300
one that I've referred to

49:55.300 --> 49:57.540
in my introduction, a case of conscience.

49:58.240 --> 49:58.900
Well, we just, people,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.420
talk slightly, it's rather more mixed than that.

50:02.820 --> 50:08.420
James Bush had many of the characteristics of the writers who appeared in the 40s and

50:08.420 --> 50:12.300
in the early 50s and changed the nature of science fiction.

50:13.360 --> 50:19.160
Like many of the best of them, he had received a scientific education and no science fiction

50:19.160 --> 50:24.980
writer had a greater respect for what Jim called the science in science fiction.

50:26.620 --> 50:33.240
He produced his cultural knowledge in his character, what is sometimes called hard and sapphire dealers.

50:34.120 --> 50:41.580
He was good at inventing credible hardware such as Ice 4, which was used in the building of the

50:41.580 --> 50:44.140
Bridge on Jupiter in the National House Stars.

50:45.040 --> 50:49.620
And the sun material was used for the bones of swimming in the Seeding Program.

50:50.860 --> 50:56.780
It was in Seeding Program also, however, he gave the word panterky to indicate an alternative

50:56.780 --> 51:01.300
strategy to what Jack Williamson had called much earlier terraforming.

51:03.100 --> 51:09.420
Many of his SF fictions were derived from what he called the Black and Dark Equations,

51:10.300 --> 51:16.960
which had been fictionally justified in the building of the Jupiter Bridge and which led to the construction of the Spindig.

51:16.960 --> 51:23.140
Amazing. Perhaps the most famous, or one of the most famous, of the fictional interstellar

51:23.140 --> 51:28.240
drives and the chief narrative power in the what can't be known as the Settles in Flight series.

51:30.060 --> 51:32.240
The Black and Dark form of it comes up again and again.

51:33.080 --> 51:41.020
It is the basis of the development of BSP in Jack of Eagles and the direct communicator for talking

51:41.020 --> 51:47.360
about interstellar distances was one of numerous spin-offs from the original equation.

51:49.660 --> 51:52.180
But there is much more to a Jim Bresch than this.

51:53.580 --> 51:59.580
In him, this respect for the facts and possibilities of science is part of a broader passion for

51:59.580 --> 52:05.420
intellectual knowledge and sometimes of a search for ultimate truth.

52:06.420 --> 52:09.380
This preoccupation appears again and again in the fiction.

52:10.560 --> 52:16.380
To up the end of his most popular story, Selfistension, the dying pirate says,

52:16.880 --> 52:19.400
there is nothing that knowledge cannot do.

52:20.300 --> 52:25.220
In Earthman Come Home, John Malfee says to the assembled Oakley Moors,

52:26.120 --> 52:31.240
that's the priceless coin, gentlemen, the universal coin, human knowledge.

52:32.140 --> 52:36.720
And then in Dr. Milagales, he found what he'd opened on his deathbed,

52:37.440 --> 52:43.720
asking God to forgive him for having pursued power and intellectual truth instead of only the latter.

52:44.840 --> 52:50.920
And then in Black Easter, the protagonist has sacrificed everything in pursuit of knowledge.

52:52.720 --> 52:59.660
This concern with intellectual truth is closely linked with the problem of moral choice in the existence of evil.

53:02.080 --> 53:07.520
The question is dramatized in the Jesuit intelligence of Willis Sanchez,

53:08.160 --> 53:10.080
the scientist priest in the case of conscience.

53:12.060 --> 53:17.060
In Jim's system of thought, in the scarring, to give us one of his favorite words,

53:17.940 --> 53:24.220
it wasn't merely justifiable if it was necessary sometimes to help people who offended the ghosts,

53:24.520 --> 53:26.280
the intellectual and the moral code.

53:27.320 --> 53:31.580
John Malfee said, the first freedom is freedom to hope.

53:32.580 --> 53:39.220
In a personal letter from Jim, one of the matters, he described John Malfee as one of his favorite characters.

53:41.200 --> 53:44.220
The people who were hated often appeared as snakes.

53:45.320 --> 53:51.380
In early technology, in the model of life of the stars, the most hated figure is Frank Loetz,

53:52.020 --> 53:54.920
the manager of the most evil of the tramp cities.

53:55.800 --> 53:59.880
But instead of hearing that, he has no more feeling than a snake.

54:00.940 --> 54:04.420
And then in the later technology, in the model of case of conscience,

54:05.240 --> 54:10.820
it seems that the product of the fertilized egg may return to the seamless planet of Lycia

54:10.820 --> 54:14.700
and begin to play the role of the first of all snakes.

54:16.800 --> 54:21.140
I said a very late with Jim on one of those famous mornings,

54:21.840 --> 54:27.200
and it is currently the characteristics of various kinds of snakes,

54:28.600 --> 54:30.220
happily without naming any names.

54:31.860 --> 54:37.340
The catalog of snake-like furlings seemed to be almost interminable.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.640
Now, I almost ended down all this,

54:42.020 --> 54:45.400
who was cramping down some little pretty nipples in a nearby corner.

54:46.700 --> 54:47.720
I said almost.

54:49.500 --> 54:52.920
I thought that I supposed was the traditional Christian bill,

54:53.500 --> 54:55.400
that one should hate the same and not the same.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.780
And I tried to support my arguments,

54:58.080 --> 55:01.920
but I rather badly remembered the quotation from O'Feller.

55:03.680 --> 55:04.340
Jim said,

55:04.420 --> 55:06.980
If O'Feller could support my case better if I used a different text,

55:07.500 --> 55:10.920
and it promptly delivered a long and full quotation in Italian.

55:12.940 --> 55:14.620
When he finished, I asked him what it was.

55:15.480 --> 55:18.880
The time it was from Baruto's libretto, for Verdi's Attello,

55:19.780 --> 55:23.460
and it has been a superior to the Shakespearean verses, from which it was derived.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.160
I thought somewhat cut down,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.720
particularly as I knew Jim as Pranley, Stiles and Jim and Opperman.

55:31.640 --> 55:34.200
I noted that a considerable time after this,

55:34.840 --> 55:37.900
I reviewed some of Jim's short stories for the fanzine cypher.

55:38.820 --> 55:41.160
I said, as a tribute to Jim's art,

55:41.160 --> 55:43.780
that one couldn't help hating the people,

55:44.520 --> 55:49.920
who were responsible for the evil happenings in such stories as tomb tappel.

55:51.480 --> 55:53.840
I said to Friendly that Fran Lassif and Jim

55:54.840 --> 55:57.400
told my attention that evening, some years before,

55:58.160 --> 56:01.080
and pointing out that I had changed sides, since I last discussed it.

56:03.740 --> 56:07.260
Things like this made Jim a very formidable friend.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.840
It was alarming when he indicated,

56:09.840 --> 56:15.320
in a few casual words, that he was totally master of a complete field of knowledge,

56:16.060 --> 56:18.340
which one had hitherto been scarcely aware of.

56:19.400 --> 56:22.340
It was even more alarming when he indicated in a few more words,

56:23.040 --> 56:25.060
that he considered this obscure field of knowledge

56:25.060 --> 56:28.300
to be helpful and relevant to whatever it was he was trying to talk to him about.

56:30.100 --> 56:32.500
I remember the first British Melfed Conference.

56:33.780 --> 56:37.460
Jim came in with a well-worn, over-staffed tashac case.

56:38.420 --> 56:40.480
I imagined that it was crammed on manuscripts

56:40.980 --> 56:43.480
of Jim's Athlean night notes upon them.

56:44.940 --> 56:47.880
He sat there with the felt surgical scar on his neck.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.540
The gin and tonic held him in hand.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.540
The tending so much, you could hear the eyes clippin' against the glass.

56:54.580 --> 56:56.300
He would sit out on the other hand,

56:57.000 --> 56:59.560
and would be drew continuously by the section of his cheeks.

57:00.840 --> 57:02.240
And that slightly wrapped his eyes,

57:02.840 --> 57:05.560
it was so terrible intent, and so terribly sincere,

57:05.560 --> 57:06.840
and so terribly honest.

57:08.920 --> 57:11.460
I'm not thinking that if a special part of heaven was set aside

57:11.460 --> 57:12.960
for science fiction people,

57:14.140 --> 57:16.540
then Jim would have a seat around at the very top.

57:17.720 --> 57:18.860
He'd be served at the side,

57:19.880 --> 57:22.580
because he'd put the fuel of gold into more science fiction letters

57:22.580 --> 57:23.820
than any man would ever do.

57:27.540 --> 57:30.940
Jim won't seem to act on a mostly quote, I think, tupperism.

57:40.180 --> 57:42.140
Shteghe, and it's probably long,

57:43.140 --> 57:43.820
here's the lithium,

57:44.760 --> 57:48.380
hands over the gift that he's promised to give to the priest.

57:51.960 --> 57:54.660
It was only a short journey to the clearing,

57:55.700 --> 57:57.620
where the mighty spindle of the ship

57:57.620 --> 57:59.840
stood nearly to weave its way

57:59.840 --> 58:02.580
back through the genodesics of deep space

58:02.580 --> 58:04.640
to the sun that shone on Peru.

58:06.020 --> 58:08.120
There was even some sunlight here,

58:08.380 --> 58:11.560
piercing now and then through low scudding clouds,

58:12.260 --> 58:13.740
which is a delay in the morning,

58:14.400 --> 58:16.300
and we'd begin again soon enough.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.220
The baggage went on board,

58:19.420 --> 58:21.100
so we lay and we had any fuss.

58:22.180 --> 58:25.780
Shteghe, the specimen, the poem, the tapes, the special reports,

58:26.040 --> 58:29.760
the recording, the sample cases, the slide boxes, the variants,

58:30.600 --> 58:33.500
the type cultures, the press, the plants, the animal cages,

58:33.500 --> 58:35.740
the tubes of soil with chunks of ore,

58:36.360 --> 58:39.780
the lithium manuscripts in their atmospheres of helium.

58:40.540 --> 58:45.700
Everything was lifted recklessly by the cranes and swung inside.

58:47.480 --> 58:50.200
Our grandstee went up the creek still up first.

58:50.460 --> 58:52.620
We'd replay this following him, a barracks bag,

58:52.780 --> 58:53.840
slung over one shoulder.

58:54.420 --> 58:58.500
On the ground, Clevo was stirring in some last minute bit of beer,

58:58.500 --> 59:02.520
something that seemed to require delicate, almost reverent,

59:02.640 --> 59:06.300
begging down before the cranes could be allowed to take it

59:06.300 --> 59:08.160
in their indifferent grip.

59:09.200 --> 59:14.280
Clevo was politically motherly about his electronic operations.

59:15.600 --> 59:18.440
Leith Sanchez took advantage of the delay

59:18.440 --> 59:22.900
to look around once more at the more margins of the forest.

59:24.100 --> 59:26.540
At once, he saw Shteghe.

59:27.480 --> 59:30.880
The lithium was standing at the entrance to the path

59:30.880 --> 59:33.580
the earth and the sea served to take him through the city

59:33.580 --> 59:34.620
to reach the ship.

59:35.060 --> 59:36.580
He was carrying something.

59:37.860 --> 59:39.600
Clevo swore under his breath

59:39.600 --> 59:42.700
and undid something he had just done to do it in another way.

59:43.460 --> 59:45.800
Leith Sanchez raised his hand.

59:46.900 --> 59:50.200
Immediately, Shteghe walked toward the ship.

59:50.800 --> 59:52.620
He looked low through his strides,

59:52.740 --> 59:55.480
which nevertheless seemed almost leisurely.

59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.220
I wish you a good journey, the lithium saying,

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.060
whatever you may go.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.240
I wish all soldiers may lead back to this world of some future time.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.000
I have brought you a gift that I sought before to give you,

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.720
if the moment is now appropriate.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.160
Clevo had straightened up and was now growing up suspiciously at the lithium.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.560
He said he did not understand the language.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.980
He ran over to find anything to which he could object.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.040
He simply stood there and radiated his unwelcomeness.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.080
Thank you, Leith Sanchez said.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.880
This creature of Satan made him miserable all over again,

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.280
making him feel he was tired being alone.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.600
But how could Shteghe learn?

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.360
The lithium was holding out to the small vars,

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.200
sealed at the top, and provided the two jiffy-looping handles.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:59.200
The greenery-prostlum in which it had been made

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.000
still carried inside it under the glaze, the fire, which had formed it.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.440
It was irresistible, alive, with man-cruising festoons,

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.360
and cruelly-wound bones, and the foam of a hole

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.900
which had made any quarter of grease that bound in his tray, being shown.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:22.580
If you see it beautifully, you can imagine, no, this was it too.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.880
Certainly, one could not make a lamp of it,

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:29.620
or feed it with leftover bits and put it in the refrigerator,

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.660
besides it would take up too much space.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.620
This is the gift, Steghe said.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.300
It is the finest container yet to come out of Kharadesh to Kirtan.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.920
The material of which it is made

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.720
includes traces of every element to be found in lithium,

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.740
even including iron.

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:56.440
And thus, as you see, it shows the colors of every shade of emotion and of thought.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:00.800
On earth, it will tell earthmen much of lithium.

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.400
You will be unable to analyze it, which Steghe said.

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.580
It is too perfect to destroy, too perfect even to open.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.660
Ah, but we wish you to open it.

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:17.860
Steghe said, for it contains our other gift.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:19.840
Another gift?

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.140
Yes, and the more important one.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.900
It is a fertilized living egg of our species.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.740
Take it with you, while the time in each earth is well hatched,

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.440
and when you're ready to blow up the human world's tray

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.980
in a marvelous world, the container is the gift of all of us.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.340
But the child inside is my gift, for it is my child.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:51.900
Appalled, Ruth Stancher took the ground and crumbled hands of those

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.160
who expected it to explode as indeed he did.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.220
It shook with subdued flame in his grip.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.140
Goodbye, Steghe said.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.520
The child and walked away, back towards the entrance to path,

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.600
clinging to what Steghe showed in his eyes.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.340
Now, what was there a lot about the food, to be said?

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.280
That snake couldn't have made a bigger thing out of it,

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.620
he'd been handing it over on a platter,

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.640
and all the time it was only a jet?

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.480
Ruth Stancher did not answer.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.600
He could not have spoken even to himself.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.260
He turned away and began to serve the kids,

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.260
craving the vows carefully in one ear though.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.600
It was not the gift he had hoped to bring into the whole city

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.200
to the grand indulgence of all mankind,

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.520
no, but it was all he had.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:50.380
While he was still coming, a shadow passed rapidly over the whole,

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:56.220
King Louis's last crate being worn amoth with the whole by a crane.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.020
When he was in the oar lock,

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.740
a rising wind of the ship's neons generated the lantern.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:05.980
A man's shadow's sunlight was cast ahead of him,

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.340
he could not his shadow on his deck.

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:14.160
After a moment, a second shadow overlaid and blurred his own,

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:18.620
cleavered, when the light dimmed and went out.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.080
The air-locked door slammed.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:32.340
John Bernard and Josephine Saxton are coming on the platform now.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.160
One of John's most intense and private passions was for Petrie,

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.160
not only the Petrie of other people, but his own Petrie.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.640
Though it's not very long ago, man,

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.800
if you do get Petrie himself and some of it was published,

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.200
all over the American magazines, most came from magazines,

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.080
but a few times from some of the prestigious academic reviews.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.920
John Bernard was a person with LeBart James Blish himself,

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.440
and his only name was Oven,

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.440
and then he would be with Petrie and James Blish.

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:16.520
It is perhaps not as widely recognized among his leadership

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:21.860
as it should be that as well as a masterly writer prose,

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.820
the last from the last James Blish,

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.180
apparently a considerable range and power

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.140
was a compact, condensed and highly personal approach.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.100
I was, as Charles has just said,

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:41.780
little intending to preface this short reading

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.940
with some comments of my own,

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:49.580
but I feel it is best that this little known aspect

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.520
of James's work speak on its own behalf.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.180
I have been fortunate in being given by Judith Blish

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.820
a collection of his poems which she assures me

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.580
will now be his own great favorites.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.360
This is called Orcs in Phoenix.

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:13.390
Singly quoted, lack-stopping mother of unicorns,

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.980
lifting your helix-scrooge's savers from the waterless,

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.800
worthy poise, bleeped and shy to haunt the remote empty quarter,

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.300
virgin in abe, illusive, gentle of legend,

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.060
antelope horse of sweet and measureless dream

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.260
we have trapped you now in our industrial desert.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:38.160
Outside your home of toll

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.540
and imprisoned zodiac ministers breathe poison

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.060
in the mid-dirt-classy drops,

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.920
the new tombs of St. Maddoine Sully

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.240
are waiting in earthquake.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.300
We, the new love of tombs,

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.200
stare and fall to believe

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.920
our girls' lackless need of the far-from-heaven giggle

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.020
to see you wonder and laugh at your story.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.660
You who shall shake your beauty forever in the protection.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.040
This, called Son of the Eye,

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:19.460
includes some of the most famous anagrams in all of history,

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.880
those in which Galileo confuses his discoveries

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.620
concerning the natures of the planets.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.760
Son of the Eye.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.120
How can a tae-ran-ne, ian, first-reli, guinta

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.280
or ian?

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.460
Women then, forgive me,

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.400
make sure, though those captures are

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.820
and the streets are fostered are

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.140
my body's world-line stardust yours,

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:46.140
excelsiating the fabulous 11th companion of Ganymede

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.620
sneaking the sit from the chas.

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.520
All of us, lete, covite,

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.380
I understood that was,

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.360
at the stall of its geodesic,

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:56.680
not flinging before,

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.740
except in phrase where

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.620
he be much removed,

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.560
is not, nor am I, much afraid.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.140
In your room, now, come over,

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.220
if I ask you, that I talk mountain.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.760
It is my star's removing-tot.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.620
I am stalled as old as Ireland,

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.520
as green as Comet's hair,

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.180
caught from the Jovian shoulder,

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:23.540
parametric to his customary need.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.960
The placer does not change.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.740
He is quick, subtone, quicker,

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.100
and the cusps of the darker square.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.800
Forgive me, I shake my name and hope.

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.340
Not changing the word,

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.720
quintiae, figuras, and latero,

01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:44.700
nato, ha-mol, said Alice.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:50.140
This is called theory of the right action.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.200
The poem and twisted consciousness

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.080
is known with the mason's square,

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.220
and both its journey armed

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.000
to be taken through each sentence

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.120
with a lifted lead.

01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:09.000
The drawing where she is the thing done,

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.060
the indifusible stone joined at the carpenter,

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.860
whose shop is drawn by toky loss of blood.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.180
That does be true in our memory.

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.380
Stick heart,

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.540
plays no toll,

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.880
if it were to hold the stone,

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:25.860
and also the oil, but just coming

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:27.340
but it was in the crowd,

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.280
it shied its hat,

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.460
and so it speak in her ear to

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.300
mutter out the clarion-headed hunt,

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.020
freight it, and wear a little spear,

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.560
in which it was just entered

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.460
a lice of green salt.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.200
And this is called,

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.560
probably this is also its first line.

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.660
Tabby, there,

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.480
saw this up,

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.460
his thirsty sickness punished.

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:57.900
With such cheer,

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.540
he watched the dripping tar

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.820
tick in the way,

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.040
as though an actor whipped,

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.480
that was anew,

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.860
the dead, not tragic,

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.420
in the tear that we are,

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.240
spoken by fruit affairs,

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.200
and so that time issues

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.240
in the hands that once had loved.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.580
And death,

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.640
the open word,

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.780
with planets to destroy,

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:22.680
after a loop,

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.260
so generous of gold and miserly of water.

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.680
And the beef-coast bridge,

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:30.660
father of God's,

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.640
dream of swords,

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.420
pure of a silver child,

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.220
content to yield up his small joy.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.960
And as a particular favor,

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.780
I have asked the chairman

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.280
to move me to add,

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.520
to be of use for Columbus, by Jim,

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.720
something which I did not know

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.220
until he was no longer with us,

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.280
he's very dearly loved.

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:56.000
And it sounds somewhat of what I would like to say,

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:57.960
but I feel it better,

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.840
simply, to read you,

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:02.860
the name for the maker,

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:03.820
for whom you've done far.

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:06.960
With that,

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.160
he lay loose and gladness,

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.020
and tublif,

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.240
now with great sickness,

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.100
and favorite with enmity,

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.100
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.300
My presence here is all vain,

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:23.480
Larry, this false world is perthensitary,

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.240
that flesh is brackled,

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.460
a fiend is sleeved.

01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.900
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.840
The state of man does change,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.260
and very no sound,

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.340
no sick, no blood, no sorrow,

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.300
no dust, and merry no look today.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.760
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.840
No state, and earth, to stand is sicker.

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.260
As would be when we were just the whichers,

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.380
and we missed this world's vanity.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.680
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.800
And to that death go so,

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.280
and this state is princess,

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:58.880
prelate, and peristate,

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.900
with rich and poor all at all degree.

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:04.980
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:07.420
It takes the nights into the field,

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.420
and I am it under her own shield.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.080
Victor deals that armily.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.380
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.060
That strong unmasked filter,

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.200
and takes on another's breast,

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.740
so come the baby full of the enmity.

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.900
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.320
He takes the champion in the store,

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.460
and the captain close it in the tower,

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.800
the lady in power full of beauty.

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.040
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.220
This bear is no lord for his presence,

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.280
nor clack for his intelligence,

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.960
his office bright may no man be.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.340
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.660
At magicians and astrologers,

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.000
retards, magicians, and theologians,

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.860
then help this no concluciancy.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.960
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.900
In merees and in his practitioners,

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.080
leeches, surgeons, and physicians,

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.480
the self for dead may not simply.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.280
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:10.020
In seeing that knackers among the lay,

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.160
place here the pageants sing words to grave,

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.320
spares his noct there fatality.

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.380
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.900
Then he must roam her brother chain,

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.240
he will not let me live alone.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.240
Of course, I man his next baby.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.740
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.920
Since for the bed-dive,

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.960
only this man bestest that we

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.320
for death dispel after our death,

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.560
but if may we,

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:48.280
Tim of Mott is controlled by me.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.480
Incomprehensibly,

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.900
our ancestors preferred

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.640
future factions of the evolution.

01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.360
They were inbound

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.740
wrapped in sheets of lead

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.720
to a stork in coffins and a bolt.

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.260
When nighttime came,

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.980
I went to grow into a stork,

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.220
a leaf, a flower,

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:12.960
and a game of corn.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.860
Thank you, James Blige.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.400
Greater than his axe,

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:19.040
to me is another thing,

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.260
is greater than his sword, a glint,

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.400
so some of the works,

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.760
which James Blige left behind

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.600
in the London death,

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.140
and which are, as yet, unopened.

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.060
A few months before his death,

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:37.900
about ten months,

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.160
so to remember,

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.320
James Blige asked me

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.880
to collaborate on another thing.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.660
It was a science fiction novel,

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.140
and he's been nursing the idea

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.260
for about a year.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.880
After consideration,

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.520
about a minute,

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.540
I can sense it.

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.500
James was not only a writer,

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.920
he was a mixed-rude teacher and critic,

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.080
and I thought well enough

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.100
it was his mind to not show me it.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.760
He thought well enough was my work

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.380
to believe that we could

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.140
make a great success of the project,

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.360
with enthusiasm, our work began.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.960
This evening, I'm about to meet

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.720
James Shortpeace, his hero,

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:26.800
engaged to me, to ask what I thought of it.

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.200
This is a talk of the message.

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:32.320
I've chosen it because it was a typical piece of hair

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.040
I've had to burn myself.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.020
Those who knew the idea

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.120
would be surprised, or so he felt.

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.860
A great joke, which we should,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.740
with the certainty,

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.780
with our universe, with another guest,

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:49.500
which bits have been written by Richard Stock.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.640
I was, actually,

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:55.200
this is a little infrastructure,

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.180
you see, I was this evening

01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:59.100
to a good work from James Joyce.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.760
I had read other things to James Bliss on occasion,

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:07.440
and he said that he loved to listen to my voice

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.540
because of, I presume, what he imagined

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:11.980
to be its most accent.

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:15.180
I practiced reading the famous

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:18.080
Anna Livia passage in a Welsh accent,

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.940
and somehow it left me a sense of meaning.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.520
So that is why I show,

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.920
I feel this little reading of a work

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.580
which I'm left to complete by myself, perhaps.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.140
From the plots, plans, outlines,

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.660
discussions, and ideas

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.980
which so excited our imagination

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:40.500
in the blatant sense,

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.500
before I fully realised that I would be less

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.840
if you were to go for this jargon

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.540
literally on my own trip.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.300
There's a quote at the beginning

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.140
of this particular little chapter.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.200
The great spirit that moves the world

01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.580
is that long ago,

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.160
you could not possibly have lived as long as this.

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.080
It's a quote from the most American Indian

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.240
by far, of course.

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:11.240
Soon, you did not know what you had expected

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.260
and used the power to the vessel to be like,

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.900
but you were none of us to take you back

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:17.580
by the simplicity of this one.

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:20.560
Soon, you came to the other transpire

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.460
to a drop concerning two airbeds side by side.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.480
Your power source was visible,

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.780
no other ammunition,

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:31.220
even the entrance pro-touch fans without guidance.

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.760
Only this was clearly heard of her.

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.840
The airbeds, too, became almost impossible to see

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.760
in the light from the bare cabin outside.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.780
There was a faint difference in the world index of reflection

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.640
and that was all.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:48.080
The pilot went on one, and when she did,

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.640
I could have stretched the deck by real stress and anchors.

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.260
He laid on the side on the other,

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.640
with his not-touching self.

01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:58.840
Proud of the car works, she asked him.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.600
He looked surprised.

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.500
After a projection, he said,

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:04.020
what else?

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.240
She could think of all kinds of...

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:11.080
Then I thought that he thought leaving the body behind.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.500
Such would be infactical.

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.760
He felt silent, and the pilot was doing nothing but over.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.300
Fortunately, she already knew why intercoms is trouble,

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.120
as opposed to interstellar, had survived the talk.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.900
It was because of the nation on Titan,

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.320
which represented another much-public,

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.120
which desired most extreme physical separation

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.500
from all other enclosures.

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:37.300
The Titanianism was nothing of an exchange

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.520
managed by the ideal.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.820
With an exchange for a few supplies,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.280
they could not manufacture on their giant moon

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.860
with towering, sphincter, personal contracts.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:50.000
Their philosophy, which was called stochasticism,

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.740
held that already things happened at random,

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:55.840
and which was only a feature of entropy,

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.100
that most events are undesirable.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.600
Therefore, they chose to hold many of the events

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.220
in their lives to a minimum,

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.900
and to a relatively structure of few they had to allow.

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.300
It was with the evening in their touch with them

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.280
that the limited research into the Durban system had evolved,

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:18.320
almost casually, by curiosity as an opportunity.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.920
How long would the journey take, she said, eventually?

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.340
The question is unreal.

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:29.320
The pilot closed his eyes and print to fell into deep relaxation,

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.160
leaving the profound but with great slowness.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.360
After three moments, a soft violet light

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.660
grew around his crown.

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.560
At first, she wasn't sure of this,

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.720
but at the same time, a light with same color

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.580
ensured the black and the victor

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.520
got moving both in partially.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:49.140
However, his aura was both more intense

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.320
and more localized in the human motion.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.680
It blended blood, jewelry and foreground white around his eyes,

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.640
and then blue up half his head began to go blue.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.780
Now, a green, green cloak,

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:04.700
seething into yellow around his chest and crown,

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.640
and into orange, all his lips were between his arms and hands.

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:10.760
His legs began to radiate profound redness,

01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:12.980
and at last he speak to this brown-haired female book.

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:18.000
Clearly, this radiance had to become from within him.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.040
They could see the eye that was rest upon him,

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.500
the knowingness they were arriving from the end manifest.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.860
She realized suddenly that he was frozen clear of the orbit.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.060
Oh, many people could let it say that was well known,

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.480
though she had never before seen anyone do it.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.840
That, a grandmum had said,

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.400
was because we all have the gift,

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.280
we are just enticed to use it.

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.160
Now, as it seems obvious here,

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.500
but it did explain why I had not anchored himself.

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.940
Was this what was called freefall?

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.120
She did not feel that she herself was falling.

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.320
Completed, they all had become arduous,

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.560
though she could not actually sense anything.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:59.600
Now, not factually, there seemed to be a soft warmth inside her,

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.720
just under her necklace.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:04.320
The skin of the vessel would make these chairs as safe as possible.

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:08.100
Clearly, though she could see the pilot as well as before

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:09.480
through his rainbow-caucas,

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.880
she could no longer see a tall outside the ship,

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:15.020
though its investiture was a plumber of the tool,

01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.880
no matter any sensation of motion.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.380
After a timeless, indefinite period,

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.860
the two others since the third of Angler gone,

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.460
and the rest of the two other to the way they had been is on,

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:27.900
and with them the sensation of shoes felling

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.820
which she regretted without knowing why.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.400
But she had no time to think about it,

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.480
for over her head, in her very face,

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.220
the great rainbow storm that was due

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:37.480
to raise down in silence.

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.400
Well, it was certainly more interesting

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.860
the ways of traveling and being squashed

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:43.220
into a harsher spatial tool.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.880
It was then to her, in a perfect benefit,

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.180
that the end manifest could not be persuaded

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:51.500
to transmit anything more complex than small,

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.140
dissociated molecules.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.760
Crossing over those hundreds of millions of miles

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.240
that way, she had to, could be even gellered

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.720
and arrived in an underground car.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.500
The landscape outside was stormy,

01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:06.620
and the rock would be like the ferns of the world,

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.840
except that there was no dust.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.060
So that the light was violent and brilliant,

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.720
the shadows were ink-black,

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.400
and there was a sharp horizon.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.160
She understood that that was because there is no air.

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.400
Why then were the rocks in here

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.600
every bit as well,

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.940
what existed here to a world first?

01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:33.540
We hope that evening wouldn't be complete

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:36.440
without a brief reminder of two great interests

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.560
of James Gersh,

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.480
which have both been referred to before this evening.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.120
The first of theirs is the work of James Dright.

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.740
Well, since, as you've heard,

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.400
Josephine Taksson felt she must decline

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.100
the responsibility of reading James Gersh,

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.320
who better than James Gersh?

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.520
So we're going to have a brief extract

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.200
from that famous recording of Gersh

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.080
leading the end of Anna Liddy up to Arabelle.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.980
Subdu your naish, a hungry creature.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.040
What is it that a black body grows?

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.280
And that Dwyer Gray asks them for our cauldrons.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.620
And you mean them tarpy and limes and Gregory?

01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:23.760
I mean my punk oil, the four of them, and the roar of them.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.860
The drapes, that's three on the list.

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:27.740
And old Johnny will do the along with them.

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.680
Is that the true big pleasure of the aunt?

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:32.380
Far, far.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.900
What if I were both coasting my education

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:38.660
or a glow I behold within a hedge

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.700
for my gary to come back to the innu?

01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:43.440
Where to the honey of the moon, Lord?

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.140
Die is little eat, die.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:48.440
We see that wonder in your eyes.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:51.680
We'll meet again, we'll part once more.

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:54.580
The spot I'll sleep if we are real fine.

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.860
My chaq shines high where the blue necks upset.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.220
Forgive me quick, I'm going.

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:01.060
Go die.

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.200
And you pluck your match, project me not.

01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:05.440
You're even Lord.

01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:07.500
So safe to jog with them.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:12.480
My sight of swimming ticker only by the shabbos for this place.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.380
I saw them, smoldering her by and away, my van away,

01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:20.400
totally out to black mine.

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.680
Oh, I bet she was the queer-owns,

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:26.660
the ocean-y-ho, the analytical thinker-toes.

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.780
And sure she was the queer-own dance-toot,

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.000
the old deathly dumpling,

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.980
the sister father of fingers and dracogills.

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.180
Daffodil and Gamble, you are no gangsters.

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.580
How did he seven dimes to wavin'

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.780
and every dimes had of seven crutches?

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.160
And every crutch had of seven hues?

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.600
And each you had a different crime?

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.740
Stunts for me and suffer for you?

01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:51.020
And the doctors billed for George on?

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.820
Before, before, the marriage is market's cheap,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.100
I fell on earth like any intrudin' capitalist even.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.940
And their pink, illumin'y creamy burdening,

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:02.820
and their precious Indian nose

01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:05.320
that had naked mass who was despised,

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.680
then all the laws was fair,

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:08.880
to tell them land,

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.580
teams of times and happy returns

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:12.940
was the same in you.

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:15.700
All the ego was here at all,

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.100
and the laws,

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.660
living in pure abundance to be.

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.880
Not many sting would cite the ex-place,

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.820
but how much decorators make each one in person

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:28.120
blabbing with that nature in the east collide,

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:31.260
out in your sunscreen to the Arabian,

01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.980
your Koscivi's eblin' insist,

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:36.880
he had backcourt paps on him,

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.260
paps-lums, croissants,

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:40.960
who know,

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.100
things of his bosom,

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.960
not say this,

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.080
and who,

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:46.960
who,

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.420
that all known,

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:49.120
what,

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:51.220
is chittering doctors of?

01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:52.160
What?

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.060
I'm here with the doctors of,

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.120
the chittering doctors of,

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.720
chittering that seed-nice-backed-talk,

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.680
or are we not gone a-home,

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:07.280
back-torn-below-own,

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.780
can't hear the back-of-back

01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:12.420
all the listening-offers of?

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.940
Oh, tough-taker,

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.580
white-gloose won't lose,

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:22.640
I feel at all as Yander Allen,

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.040
a ten-ton-duck-sharmershimp,

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.460
all living as doctors of,

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.080
dark-hawks of Europe,

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:35.040
my whole head-horned,

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.720
I feel as heavy as Yander Stone,

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.980
telling me of Sharm in the Sharm,

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.280
who knows Sharm in Sharm,

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.300
the living sons and doctors of,

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:49.800
night-night,

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.720
family-family, family-own,

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:58.520
family-family, family-family,

01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:58.780
family-family, family-family,

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:00.380
the family-telling-back-of-out,

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.960
the family-telling-back-of-out,

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.380
now you know.

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.940
I'm not that way confused yet,

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:10.900
no, James Blush,

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.680
and a very different one.

01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:16.200
We are moving northwards from Dublin in the District,

01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:17.780
to Belfast in the Lagon,

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:20.180
in fact, we're moving to Bob Shaw,

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:21.760
one of the most distinguished

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.540
of our science fiction writers here in this country,

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:27.180
and he's going to talk about beer.

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:32.300
I don't know if anybody realizes it,

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.500
but when Judy was master-mining,

01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:38.240
it's easy when we're hopping together,

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:42.940
she assigned different tasks to different people,

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.820
and she told me I was to speak about beer,

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:52.560
and I'm wondering why I was chosen for this particular job.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.100
It may have been because a couple of years ago

01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.960
at a convention, I was seen

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.800
standing holding a pint of beer,

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:08.060
but I'd like to hasten to add

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.860
that this beer didn't belong to me,

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.520
I was mining it for somebody else.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.780
In fact, it belonged to Harry Harrison,

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.460
who had just stepped upstairs to write a novel.

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:29.460
Actually, the subject isn't in a good mood to Jim,

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:30.440
as we all know,

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.540
and I first met him, and I expected him to be

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:38.480
a very grim, very serious type of person in all levels,

01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:40.800
and he was on the get-in,

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.180
and cropped up a lot in his work.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.640
I mean, I presumed he'd find such a man

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.800
actually set to Jim.

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.900
Don't worry about on the get-in,

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.300
this won't be the end of the world.

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:58.300
In fact, there was a long, long connection

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.680
to SF fighters and beer.

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.220
It's fairly unobtrusive,

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.560
but thinking back on it,

01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.300
it's done like this gracefully,

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.480
but then,

01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:12.980
sadly, of course,

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:16.180
introduced beer to Mars in his books.

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:18.660
Well, Beer-Kynes,

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:21.300
he complained a lot about Asmone

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:24.080
stirring the desert with beer-Kynes,

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:29.140
and spoiled the literary ancient fragile tempest,

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:33.580
and then in science fiction family in the 50s,

01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.800
I seen the member, there was actually a project

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.300
to build a pile of beer-Kynes

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:39.780
which had expanded right up to a moon.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.700
I'm talking about Jim,

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.720
he liked beer,

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.140
and he brought bottles of beer along

01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:48.920
from the conventions,

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.000
carefully chosen,

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:54.560
but then it said a lot

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.540
for causing political paces

01:29:56.540 --> 01:30:00.020
that he even learned to like English pub beer,

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.100
and this is quite a feat for an American

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:06.040
who's used all his life

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.120
to the tune of the Fizzing Drink

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.920
which is served up in American bars

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.240
and given into the name of beer.

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.140
The girth which exists between

01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:20.660
that kind of beer and all,

01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:23.200
it's summed up in a conversation,

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.600
a three-corner conversation,

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:26.920
Jim and I were having a new fan

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.580
at the Coventry,

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.800
and this chap is a keen member of camera

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.340
in the campaign for AOL,

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.740
and he's describing a beer he's got

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.200
in a pub which he's recommending,

01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:42.160
and he started off describing this pint,

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:44.020
he said it was a bit sour,

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:45.680
lukewarm,

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.520
he had this a pancake, perfect!

01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:51.840
And Jim,

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.560
he knew enough to agree with him

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:57.060
because he hadn't liked

01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.380
learned to appreciate our kind of beer,

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:01.120
and

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.760
I mean, he understood through that

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:08.340
a dedicated boozer

01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:10.840
isn't put off a drink just because

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.380
it doesn't taste very nice,

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:18.900
and sometimes we have to force ourselves,

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:22.980
and it's quite often in my life

01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:24.420
things I might enjoy myself

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:25.880
and going through hell,

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.760
and I don't want to run over time

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:35.080
on perhaps a lot of trivial aspects

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.520
of what we were talking about this evening,

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.480
but I got one fine beer store about Jim

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.060
and it goes back to the time

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.840
two years ago when four

01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:50.180
SCF riders were commissioned

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:51.720
by the Arts Council of Great Britain

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.940
to do a week-long tour of the Northeast,

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:55.860
giving time to the people

01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:56.180
and folks,

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:01.280
and Mark Adelard was one who was there,

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:05.300
and then one or two nights in that week

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:09.380
Mark and I put away quite a lot of beer

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:10.320
and other drinks,

01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:13.960
and we were further enough,

01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:16.580
the organizers of that,

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.040
otherwise very good week,

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.920
had made the gasky error

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.780
of putting it into a Tampant Hotel,

01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:27.560
and the lady who ran it

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:30.180
was a well-appearance chemical type,

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.820
and Mark and I

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:36.580
arrived home one night about two,

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.340
one morning about two,

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.200
and we had forgotten our keys,

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:44.580
and I remember very well that last walk up to the hotel,

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:49.480
because we tipped into and against each other at every step,

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:53.220
and it was strange this sequence bumping in detail,

01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:55.160
which went on the whole way along that street,

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.580
but we couldn't help it.

01:32:57.660 --> 01:32:58.780
We got to the hotel,

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.640
and one of these places made up of

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:04.040
what had formerly been a role of private houses,

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:05.940
all joined together,

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:09.100
and all the entrances seated up tight,

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.220
except the one which was first used to the hotel,

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.700
and Mark and I hadn't our keys,

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.200
but we tried all the other doors,

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.740
any of which hadn't been open for years,

01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.160
but we didn't have the faces

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.700
later on in the pub or the hotel,

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:25.360
and finally had to move to Gore,

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.780
and she came out in her nightgown

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:30.500
and pulled us off very, very severely,

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.060
so that was a good time that week,

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:38.540
but it was hard, and she wasn't going to put up with people who drank a lot,

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.780
because they're having like that in her premises.

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.020
And the next day,

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.440
that was the fourth day of the week,

01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:48.780
Jim was arriving,

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.180
and I was told into the owner of the hotel,

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.100
Arkham and Lobby, and Jim,

01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:59.580
he decided to go into part two of the telling off,

01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:01.500
and to really go on and on,

01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:03.320
but she didn't like the losers,

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.080
and this is a tempered heart,

01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:09.040
and then just that moment Jim came into the hall,

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.040
and he was bit tired,

01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.260
he had travelled up from London,

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:14.640
and he was wearing a black coat

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:19.480
and a black pole neck shirt,

01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:22.020
and his fur hat pulled down,

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:24.720
and he looked remarkably aesthetic,

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:30.000
and the aunt lady looked at him and said,

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.320
is this Mr. Brish?

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:32.960
I said yes, that's Mr. Brish,

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.200
and said, is he a minister?

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:38.640
I said no,

01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:41.840
but he has written books with the outlawedliest religion,

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:45.240
and I just lit up with this auntie,

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.980
bashed across the lobby,

01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:50.360
and said, Mr. Brish, come with me,

01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:51.480
and I'll get you a key,

01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.700
and she went to Bathway,

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.320
and he put her hands up and said,

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.540
can you get a drink here anywhere?

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:03.920
I said, can you, there are not even one of us,

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:10.120
and that's a sad and lonely aspect of Jim's character.

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:12.740
I appreciate all of our suggestions much,

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:18.120
but it's been covered very adequately by other speakers,

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.660
so I'll stand by, thank you.

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:28.220
I'm not going to go to the end and listen to James Fish himself.

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:34.240
In 1959, he won for the first time with Hugo,

01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:37.780
the supreme accolade in the science fiction world,

01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:39.960
and the following year, 1960,

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:42.240
he was invited to be guest of honor

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.580
at the Science Fiction Convention of Pittsburgh,

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.780
Pippcom, 1960,

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.580
and happily, a recording was made there

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:52.060
and it is guest of honor speech,

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:55.340
and here are a few brief extracts from it.
