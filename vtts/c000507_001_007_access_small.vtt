00:04.000 --> 00:07.740
One is in the Conan novel you did, Conan the Rebel.

00:08.140 --> 00:12.240
I was interested in how you got involved in writing that on the Conan series.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.840
Oh, this was very simple.

00:19.020 --> 00:25.960
One day the telephone rang and I picked it up and there was Elsprake the camp at the

00:25.960 --> 00:27.040
other end of the line.

00:28.060 --> 00:33.800
He was involved in a project to generate a few more Conan novels and would I be interested?

00:35.720 --> 00:45.700
Well, I'd always enjoyed Conan and without going into detail I ended up thinking what

00:45.700 --> 00:47.140
the Dickens why not do it.

00:47.740 --> 00:50.680
And I had fun doing it.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.060
You know, it didn't pretend to be literature or anything.

00:54.060 --> 01:00.760
It was just a squashbuckler but I enjoyed doing it and I hope readers have enjoyed reading it.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.220
Okay, fine.

01:04.720 --> 01:09.460
We would also like to know about the work you're presently doing.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.620
You know, what kinds of books you have, what you're working on now and what kind of future

01:12.620 --> 01:14.900
plans for things to write that you have.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.400
Well, it's a little difficult to say.

01:21.400 --> 01:30.720
After finishing that Conan book, which I did almost two years ago, I did practically

01:30.720 --> 01:31.640
no writing.

01:32.460 --> 01:40.660
I was engaged in other things until just very recently.

01:40.660 --> 01:44.820
So at the moment I'm in the middle of a novel.

01:47.060 --> 01:49.960
No, not the middle, the early part of the novel.

01:50.360 --> 01:56.480
It's going to occupy me for until the middle of summer at least.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.120
It's what my wife calls the kitchen sink novel.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.080
You throw everything in including the kitchen sink.

02:08.280 --> 02:12.440
And that's really about all I can say about it now.

02:14.280 --> 02:19.000
You don't have any kinds of movie rights on any of your books presently?

02:19.400 --> 02:22.540
No, it's merely one that I've contracted to do.

02:23.280 --> 02:29.800
It would be nice if movie rights or something like that sold but nothing like that is on the horizon yet.

02:31.800 --> 02:38.700
Okay, and my third question would be from your standpoint, having written ever since

02:38.700 --> 02:43.460
the 1940s and given the huge amount of your life that you've given to science fiction.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.880
In fact, you were president of the science fiction writers of America also.

02:48.300 --> 02:54.120
Do you think science fiction has changed as you look around right now?

02:54.120 --> 02:58.420
How does the field of science fiction look to you in contrast to when you started writing?

03:00.300 --> 03:08.580
Oh yes, I've been a great many changes back around 1940 or so.

03:10.660 --> 03:18.240
Well, practically all you could get unless you heart back to a few writers like Wells and Byron.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.980
Practically all you could get was in a few pop magazines.

03:31.160 --> 03:36.540
Nowadays, of course, there's an overwhelming flood of it.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.920
It is not possible to read all which appears.

03:45.380 --> 03:50.880
And also, of course, it's no longer disrecatable.

03:50.940 --> 03:53.700
It's become quite respectable.

03:55.800 --> 04:07.000
You know, when I was your age, it was unthinkable that anybody could arrange a telephone interview with one of the writers of it

04:07.000 --> 04:10.280
under the auspices of a college for heaven's sake.

04:11.740 --> 04:16.140
Good Lord, this was pop fiction that was beyond the pale.

04:18.280 --> 04:24.380
Nowadays, it's being taught in college courses and all this other stuff, you know.

04:29.160 --> 04:33.620
And it has sort of...

04:33.620 --> 04:36.060
But actually all this is kind of trivial.

04:36.500 --> 04:48.100
I think the important thing is that the basic concepts have sort of permeated the public mind.

04:48.100 --> 05:02.720
And I think people are aware in that nowadays in a way that they never used to be aware.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.200
But the future is going to be different from the past.

05:07.320 --> 05:15.220
It may be better, it may be worse, whatever, but it's going to be different and in very fundamental ways.

05:18.820 --> 05:24.320
And they tend to accept this, be prepared for it.

05:29.640 --> 05:33.220
And then also you'll get...

05:37.580 --> 05:39.220
Well, if I want...

05:39.960 --> 05:54.160
I often say that perhaps the most important public service that science fiction is doing is by casting a certain glamour over science and technology.

05:54.160 --> 06:05.000
It recruits a lot of young people into these fields and heaven knows we need an awful lot of scientists and technologists.

06:10.560 --> 06:20.020
Okay, that's basically one of the things we do in our class too, is try to get the students to see what science fiction has contributed, you know, toward making people aware of the future.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.060
Very good. Excellent.

06:22.060 --> 06:24.560
Okay, listen, that would probably be a good place to stop.
