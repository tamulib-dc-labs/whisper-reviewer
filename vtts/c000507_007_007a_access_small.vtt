00:01.500 --> 00:05.260
I'll ask you first of all, Warren, just to give us a little bit about your background,

00:05.980 --> 00:10.740
kind of how you grew up and what might have influenced you to be a writer and why a science

00:10.740 --> 00:11.520
fiction writer.

00:16.040 --> 00:21.340
When I was 11 years old, we moved to Texas and at that time I had been writing a little

00:21.340 --> 00:23.460
poetry for a couple years.

00:24.420 --> 00:28.660
And the first summer we moved to Texas, we didn't know anyone and didn't know any place

00:28.660 --> 00:34.820
to go and my father parked me and my brother at a boys club, Panther Boys Club in Fort

00:34.820 --> 00:35.280
Worth, Texas.

00:35.940 --> 00:38.080
And it was a blockbuster summer for Texas.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.280
I mean, they were trying to bust the top out of the thermometer.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.480
There was no air conditioning in the Panther Boys Club.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.780
We used to go down the airfare, cut off blue jeans, shorts, no shirt, no shoes, no socks,

00:46.080 --> 00:47.920
brown bag lunch and a quarter for a Coke, right?

00:48.040 --> 00:48.440
And that was it.

00:49.380 --> 00:53.180
And the only cool place in the building was the north side of the building in the library,

00:53.200 --> 00:54.320
which had a cement floor.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.520
It was the only cool spot in the building and I loved to read and went in the library

00:58.520 --> 01:01.880
and all along the bottom shelf in the library was Tom Swift and Tom Swift, Jr.

01:02.500 --> 01:07.280
And that summer I read them all, went back to school in the fall, discovered Space Cadet

01:07.280 --> 01:09.140
by Robert Heinlein and I was hooked.

01:10.760 --> 01:11.640
Absolutely hooked.

01:13.620 --> 01:18.580
And then science fiction reading formed probably on the average about 50% of my recreational

01:18.580 --> 01:21.320
reading for the rest of my life to this stage anyway.

01:22.340 --> 01:30.680
I started trying to write stories that may or may not have been science fiction or horror

01:30.680 --> 01:37.200
or cult after about the seventh grade when a teacher read in two parts Edgaron Poe's

01:37.200 --> 01:38.360
Cascofa Montillado.

01:39.320 --> 01:45.240
And for years I turned out terribly Poe-esque, grotesque, horror, gore stories.

01:48.080 --> 01:52.320
The words weren't any good but which were great fun, which were great fun to turn in

01:52.320 --> 01:52.660
in class.

01:52.920 --> 01:56.580
You know, you have to write, the teacher would say write a page of description and I write

01:56.580 --> 02:01.720
to write this lurid scene of grotesque, you know, body in the grave, Edgaron Poe description.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.420
I guess it was great early training for doing that.

02:06.280 --> 02:15.440
I didn't start trying seriously to write science fiction until about 1977, 1978 and thought,

02:15.560 --> 02:18.440
you know, I've been reading so much that I really ought to try writing some of it.

02:18.540 --> 02:21.400
I had written a war novel which is unpublishable.

02:21.860 --> 02:23.960
It's written in seven different styles.

02:25.660 --> 02:30.120
But it was the first novel that I wrote so I decided to write this science fiction novel.

02:34.440 --> 02:41.720
And discovered how little I knew about, intuitively, about the storytelling process.

02:42.720 --> 02:47.720
That the writing had always been very easy for me but how little, intuitively, I knew

02:47.720 --> 02:48.940
about the storytelling process.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.080
And so I forced myself to finish that terrible book.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.220
It has an abbreviated ending.

02:54.420 --> 02:57.740
I finally decided that, you know, the bomb would blow up and they would all disappear

02:57.740 --> 02:59.340
because I couldn't cope with them anymore.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.900
But I forced myself to finish it.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.960
And then I tried my hand at some fantasy because I was reading a fair amount of fantasy at

03:05.960 --> 03:08.460
the time and decided that I really liked science fiction better.

03:09.020 --> 03:16.760
So when I got the opportunity to quit my full-time job and only have to work part-time and write

03:16.760 --> 03:22.600
for a year, which was a contract my wife and I agreed to, then I said, you know, I'm going

03:22.600 --> 03:25.420
to give it my best shot in science fiction.

03:25.880 --> 03:30.080
And this is the genre that I've loved so I might as well do everything I can to make

03:30.080 --> 03:30.380
it work.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.760
And that's where the Windhover books came from.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.960
Okay, I've got to ask.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.240
It's the Windhover books.

03:40.260 --> 03:42.880
The hero's name is Gerard Manley.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.120
I'm not an English major but...

03:46.120 --> 03:47.140
Don't hit me.

03:47.260 --> 03:47.520
Don't hit me.

03:47.660 --> 03:47.760
You know.

03:49.060 --> 03:49.520
So...

03:49.520 --> 03:51.000
The clues are pretty evident.

03:51.000 --> 03:51.440
Yes.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.720
That slightly reminiscent of something.

03:56.260 --> 03:57.320
And is this...

03:57.320 --> 03:58.400
This was obviously delivered.

03:58.660 --> 04:00.620
Are you interested in Hopkins, the poet?

04:00.980 --> 04:03.140
Yeah, it's my left-handed salute to the old man.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.440
I mean, I think he was a poet who was probably a hundred years ahead of his time.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.820
He's not one of those poets that you walk around reciting verses to at people's and

04:13.820 --> 04:14.520
being parties.

04:15.180 --> 04:16.600
But I think he did marvelous...

04:16.600 --> 04:21.040
I think he took marvelous chances with the language and marvelous chances with poetry

04:21.560 --> 04:23.860
and some of it is just, you know, it's breathtaking.

04:25.260 --> 04:28.060
But no one's going to read a tribute to Gerard Manley Hopkins.

04:29.380 --> 04:37.160
So when I sat down to do the story, I had already decided that I was going to name the

04:37.160 --> 04:40.720
ship Windhover, which is his most famous poem, the Windhover.

04:41.980 --> 04:45.400
And it just seemed, you know, the natural thing to do, the name the character Gerard

04:45.400 --> 04:48.600
Manley, especially since he is interested in poetry, right?

04:49.060 --> 04:55.880
And then in the second book, when Gerard finds himself at the end of his road and thinks

04:55.880 --> 05:00.840
this is going to be it, it's going to be all over, he writes a poem to GM, which is himself,

05:01.140 --> 05:01.300
right?

05:01.420 --> 05:04.180
But it's also the poem to Gerard Manley Hopkins.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.800
And it echoes the language of the Windhover.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.360
Hopkins the Windhover.

05:11.360 --> 05:16.760
It echoes that language and asks some of the same questions only from Gerard's point of

05:16.760 --> 05:18.400
view rather than from Hopkins' point of view.

05:19.020 --> 05:20.200
So yeah, it's all very intentional.

05:20.380 --> 05:24.280
I mean, with 54-hour minor in English, it's hard to be unintentional about things like

05:24.280 --> 05:24.580
that.

05:26.260 --> 05:29.320
This is kind of a cheap shot.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.660
I read that.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.440
Theokong to cheaper ones.

05:33.640 --> 05:34.080
Yeah.

05:35.900 --> 05:41.380
What about, you know, all the 15-year-old kids that read for four hours and toss the

05:41.380 --> 05:46.120
book, you know, I guess basically the question is to what audience do you write or do you

05:46.120 --> 05:46.940
write for yourself?

05:49.900 --> 05:55.520
I think it was Raymond Chandler, but I'm not sure who said that I write first to entertain

05:55.520 --> 05:57.340
myself and hope that others are entertained.

05:59.300 --> 06:04.380
I had a certain audience awareness in that when I went back and did the second draft,

06:04.660 --> 06:12.860
I simplified the language somewhat from the original draft because I thought I had gotten

06:12.860 --> 06:13.700
too carried away.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.800
But I didn't write it thinking of a specific audience.

06:20.620 --> 06:28.100
Whereas, in the book that Ralph and I wrote together, we were aiming in a sense at an

06:28.100 --> 06:31.400
audience that starts with those 12, 13, 14-year-olds.

06:31.480 --> 06:36.140
We wanted to pick up the space opera buffs and then also write things for, you know,

06:36.160 --> 06:39.120
the older audience at the same time, trying to do both things at the same time.

06:39.180 --> 06:43.800
And it was a way of stretching to be able to do both, to keep the language simple and

06:43.800 --> 06:47.700
yet to deal with complex ideas and keep the story moving so that if you didn't want to

06:47.700 --> 06:49.840
deal with the complex ideas, you could just go through the story.

06:50.720 --> 06:55.280
But for those books, I really didn't have an audience in mind.

06:55.380 --> 06:58.600
It was just a story that I had been thinking about for eight or nine months and I wanted

06:58.600 --> 06:59.000
to tell.

06:59.860 --> 07:04.820
And that seemed more important.

07:05.020 --> 07:10.640
And then when I made the decision about how to tell the story, I knew without deliberating

07:10.640 --> 07:14.280
on a great deal that I had limited my audience.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.940
But I thought, well, I'm willing to take the chance because I figured I needed something

07:17.940 --> 07:21.560
to break into the market and I think you have to take chances to do that.

07:22.580 --> 07:23.920
It was much appreciated.

07:24.060 --> 07:24.920
I really enjoyed it.

07:25.260 --> 07:27.520
I'm glad that you stuck to your guns.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.440
This seems like as good a place as any to ask this question on the back of an image

07:35.440 --> 07:35.900
of voices.

07:36.100 --> 07:40.020
There's a quote from Anne McCaffrey out on Onaborn's ambitions for four years.

07:40.020 --> 07:45.320
So what was your relationship with Anne McCaffrey and had you corresponded with her?

07:45.560 --> 07:47.820
I was a book salesman for Ballantine.

07:48.980 --> 07:53.100
Ballantine Delray did the McCaffrey Dragon books, among others.

07:54.240 --> 07:59.160
And when she did the first promotion tour around the country for the hardcover edition

07:59.160 --> 08:05.920
of White Dragon, I cornered the Delray direct salesman and said, if you don't get her into

08:05.920 --> 08:08.740
some of my wholesale accounts, you know, I'm going to break your knees.

08:09.640 --> 08:10.680
Besides, I want to meet her.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.760
I mean, there's other reasons besides.

08:13.260 --> 08:17.940
So I got her into, I think, three of the accounts and then we took her to the airport together

08:17.940 --> 08:20.040
and her plane was an hour and a half late.

08:20.280 --> 08:24.440
So we sat in the bar in the airport drinking Coors beer, which is one of her favorites

08:24.440 --> 08:29.140
and she can't get in Ireland and listening to Annie Tell Stories, which is a marvelous

08:29.140 --> 08:30.300
experience in and of itself.

08:31.340 --> 08:37.120
When she came back the following year for the paperback tour for White Dragon, my wife

08:37.120 --> 08:40.880
and I picked her up at the airport, took her to the hotel in Dallas, which was on fire

08:40.880 --> 08:41.400
at the time.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.460
So that was all very exciting.

08:43.420 --> 08:44.720
She was extremely tired.

08:44.780 --> 08:50.000
It was the 23rd day of a 28 day tour and night, you know, in 31 cities or something like that.

08:50.000 --> 08:50.660
And she was beginning.

08:51.540 --> 08:54.940
So we ended up staying until like one or two o'clock in the morning because she couldn't

08:54.940 --> 08:56.680
sleep and just talking and chatting.

08:56.760 --> 09:01.780
And then I took her around all the next day with a case of Coors beer iced down in the

09:01.780 --> 09:06.960
back and about three melons all diced up because you can't get fresh melon in Ireland.

09:06.960 --> 09:07.560
Either right.

09:07.780 --> 09:11.380
So she munched on melon and drank Coors beer all day while we toured Dallas and Fort Worth

09:11.380 --> 09:15.280
and visited bookstores and radio stations and developed a gram rapport and ended up

09:15.280 --> 09:17.840
at the airport drinking Coors beer and having a wonderful time.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.320
So we corresponded then fairly regularly.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.780
I say fairly three or four times a year after that.

09:25.260 --> 09:29.400
And after I finished the book and Banna McBaudet, they said, you know, who do you know?

09:29.760 --> 09:32.700
And I said, well, the author I know best is Emma Caffrey.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.340
So I asked her, I said, you know, would you, would you read it?

09:35.760 --> 09:36.820
And she said, yes.

09:37.460 --> 09:39.420
And then she said those wonderful things.

09:39.460 --> 09:42.160
And I don't remember anything for about a week after getting that letter, you know,

09:43.020 --> 09:43.660
it's floating.

09:44.060 --> 09:45.040
Yes, yes, yes.

09:45.220 --> 09:49.520
It was, Annie's letter was, was as much of a high as the sale.

09:50.240 --> 09:50.640
Right.

09:50.760 --> 09:54.220
Because it was some kind of confirmation that I had in fact done it right.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.260
It was as much of a high as the sale was itself.

09:59.000 --> 09:59.400
Right.

10:01.620 --> 10:06.480
The format that you use in the two books is like a diary.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.200
And then you've got this internal dialogue.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.420
How did you develop that approach?

10:13.480 --> 10:14.700
Years of talking to myself.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.300
That's that's really it.

10:18.540 --> 10:22.560
I mean, I know a lot of writers who talk to themselves, who when they sit at the typewriter,

10:22.700 --> 10:26.740
talk, carry on conversations and go down the road by themselves in the car and carry on

10:26.740 --> 10:28.860
conversations with themselves, work out problems that way.

10:29.720 --> 10:35.580
And I thought, there's so much of me in Gerard, although there's a great deal of Gerard

10:35.580 --> 10:40.280
that isn't me, there's so much of me in him that it just seemed natural, given what had

10:40.280 --> 10:41.080
happened to him.

10:41.620 --> 10:47.360
So let him do this same thing, except to make it a little more formal and have him address

10:47.940 --> 10:49.240
himself as self.

10:51.200 --> 10:57.780
Part of that is part of how that happened to him is explained in the third book.

10:58.260 --> 11:03.020
What brought him to that point where he really began to talk to himself.

11:03.300 --> 11:06.120
That's how he got that quote unquote self reliance.

11:06.700 --> 11:06.820
Right.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.860
Is explained in the third book because of what happened to him in the missing 10 years.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.640
I can't give away the plot now.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.380
OK, because the next question I had the quote from page 200 in this one.

11:18.870 --> 11:23.320
I don't know exactly when I started talking to self and the second person, but by the

11:23.320 --> 11:27.200
time I ascended from puberty, the habit was firmly set and accepted.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.640
I was going to ask you if that was autobiographical.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.780
Yeah, probably, probably.

11:35.020 --> 11:41.200
I would catch myself doing it sometimes aloud and sometimes just to myself to the point

11:41.200 --> 11:42.690
where I no longer thought about it.

11:42.690 --> 11:49.590
But only usually instead of saying self, although I say self now, which I didn't

11:49.590 --> 11:50.950
used to do after having written the book.

11:51.090 --> 11:51.750
Now I say self.

11:51.990 --> 11:53.190
I don't know.

11:53.310 --> 11:54.790
And it's life imitating art.

11:55.850 --> 11:57.050
But it's usually Norwood.

11:57.270 --> 11:57.810
You dummy.

11:59.090 --> 12:00.730
It's Norwood this and Norwood that.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.170
And that's how I do.

12:02.290 --> 12:06.530
But I carry on the same kinds of conversation that Gerard did, although I don't ask

12:06.530 --> 12:08.670
Norwood to do the same kinds of things that he has self.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.690
I kind of know the answer to this, but we'll get it on tape anyway.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.490
The two books have a lot of poetry.

12:18.330 --> 12:20.270
So apparently you write poetry yourself.

12:20.750 --> 12:24.850
And I was going to ask you if maybe since it's difficult to sell poetry or to

12:24.850 --> 12:28.850
publish it in a lot of places, maybe this kind of lets you put some of your

12:28.850 --> 12:29.770
published somewhere.

12:30.030 --> 12:30.570
Oh, yes.

12:30.750 --> 12:30.870
Yes.

12:31.250 --> 12:35.470
One of the motives up a brandy that in the very beginning was to bootleg the

12:35.470 --> 12:36.630
poetry into the story.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.370
In fact, it was the tenderfoot cycle of poems, which.

12:42.690 --> 12:45.310
Helped me formulate how I wanted to put the story together.

12:46.090 --> 12:48.370
And all the tenderfoot poems aren't in there, fortunately.

12:50.130 --> 12:50.570
But.

12:51.590 --> 12:55.850
Part of that was part of what I wanted to do in the books, because I thought.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.030
Again, that was something else that there was.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.210
I was taking enough chances.

13:01.550 --> 13:02.690
I thought, I'll take one more.

13:03.370 --> 13:05.730
I'll go ahead and try this and see what happens.

13:08.430 --> 13:10.370
I've been writing poetry since I was nine.

13:10.370 --> 13:12.810
So I obviously believe in it in some form or another.

13:13.030 --> 13:17.110
So I thought, why not do that and see if we can make it work?

13:17.410 --> 13:21.870
And I was very fortunate and found an editor who believed in it after having

13:21.870 --> 13:24.230
talked to several others who did not believe in it at all.

13:25.670 --> 13:27.330
They won't know if it's Wussy's time.

13:27.690 --> 13:28.830
No, no, no.

13:29.090 --> 13:34.170
In fact, Judy Lindell Ray, who I had known because I worked for Ballantyne,

13:34.970 --> 13:36.210
had read the book.

13:36.710 --> 13:38.090
She was the first one to read the manuscript.

13:38.730 --> 13:42.910
And she wrote me this long, two-page detail letter about why she hated the book.

13:44.890 --> 13:45.290
And.

13:46.750 --> 13:47.550
It didn't.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.650
It didn't affect the way I felt about Judy Lind.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.950
But she said, you know, you really just put this in the bottom door, right?

13:54.050 --> 13:54.330
Another one.

13:54.890 --> 13:56.250
Well, of course, I couldn't do that.

13:56.470 --> 14:01.270
But what I did was eventually I took Judy Lind's letter back out of the door and

14:01.270 --> 14:02.790
read it and reread it and reread it.

14:02.850 --> 14:07.770
And then in the query letters, trying to get people to read the manuscript, took

14:07.770 --> 14:10.510
all those things that she hated and wrote them as if they were a list of positive

14:10.510 --> 14:11.550
attributes for the book.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.330
And so in effect, Judy Lind helped me sell the book, right?

14:14.410 --> 14:18.090
She taught me, you know, she gave me the information I needed on how to sell the

14:18.090 --> 14:18.270
book.

14:18.310 --> 14:21.010
So I took that whole list of things that she didn't like, said, this is what it is.

14:21.030 --> 14:21.590
And this is great.

14:22.050 --> 14:24.750
And that's what got Karen Haas had banned them to read it.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.210
And she liked all those things that Judy Lind didn't.

14:27.230 --> 14:27.890
So it worked.

14:28.370 --> 14:30.890
So I have to thank Judy Lindell Ray for helping me sell that book.

14:32.250 --> 14:36.990
We talked to Ardith Mayer last night and she said that she wrote poetry for many

14:36.990 --> 14:37.350
years.

14:37.350 --> 14:42.370
She feels very strongly that having written poetry really helped her prose

14:42.370 --> 14:45.610
writing because of the economy of words and that sort of thing.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.070
Do you, has that helped you with your prose?

14:48.830 --> 14:50.690
Didn't think that experience bright poetry.

14:51.270 --> 15:00.410
I think so because if you write poetry regularly and try constantly to improve

15:00.410 --> 15:04.190
it and you're constantly working with the language, you're trying to constantly

15:04.190 --> 15:08.390
trying to squeeze from the language as much meaning as possible.

15:08.550 --> 15:12.710
So it makes you extremely cognizant of words and their meanings and their subtleties

15:12.710 --> 15:13.550
and shades of meanings.

15:15.570 --> 15:19.190
I think that it can, that writing poetry can also hurt your prose.

15:19.910 --> 15:22.730
I think that you can in fact get too poetic.

15:22.950 --> 15:24.330
You're trying to put too much in.

15:24.430 --> 15:26.210
You're trying to make your prose too poetic.

15:27.050 --> 15:31.130
I think it's, I marvel at some of the stuff that Gene Wolf writes.

15:31.130 --> 15:35.490
I mean, I think some of his prose just blows me away.

15:37.330 --> 15:46.750
But at the same time, I think that sometimes he sticks with a level of writing that is

15:47.770 --> 15:51.690
almost too poetic for the part of the story he's trying to tell that instead of

15:51.690 --> 15:56.470
doing it in rhythms, he's so caught up in that rhythm, so caught up in that level,

15:56.470 --> 16:01.910
that poetic level that he can't bring it down to a faster, cleaner action scene

16:01.910 --> 16:05.310
where you get out of that and you sweep the reader along and then pull them back up

16:05.310 --> 16:06.390
to another poetic height.

16:07.070 --> 16:12.490
And so I think, you know, this is not to criticize Gene Wolf, but it's to say that

16:12.490 --> 16:19.830
I think that because he is a poet and because he is so poetically involved with

16:19.830 --> 16:25.490
the language that it has detracted a little bit from what he might have

16:25.490 --> 16:26.630
otherwise done with the story.

16:27.470 --> 16:31.710
Of course, all this is envy on my part because if I could write prose like Gene

16:31.710 --> 16:34.090
Wolf's writing, I would be a very happy man.

16:36.150 --> 16:42.430
I was reading the books, especially an image of voices because George

16:42.430 --> 16:46.990
R. Rol changed quite a bit in the second book, but it was reminisce,

16:47.390 --> 16:50.370
the situation of reminisce of a riteef, Lommer's riteef.

16:50.630 --> 16:52.250
You read the riteef.

16:52.730 --> 16:53.610
Years ago, yes.

16:54.370 --> 16:54.970
Years ago.

16:56.270 --> 17:02.850
And I tried not, I tried not to make Gerard not like riteef, right?

17:04.710 --> 17:08.370
While still, you know, maintaining that, you know, intergalactic

17:08.370 --> 17:12.470
diplomat role, I tried to make him a very different kind of diplomat.

17:13.890 --> 17:18.110
But there were times, in fact, in the first draft, there are sections where it

17:18.110 --> 17:21.150
got a little riteef-like kind of unconsciously.

17:21.170 --> 17:24.050
And then I had to go back, so gee, I think I read this somewhere before.

17:24.050 --> 17:24.770
I did, I did.

17:25.070 --> 17:26.910
And then you have to go back and clean things up.

17:29.050 --> 17:33.050
Pete, there were, they weren't characters, but the computers were, were

17:33.050 --> 17:36.730
a pretty big element in the book, which I think is real.

17:36.850 --> 17:39.990
I think the computers are going to be that important in the future, but you

17:39.990 --> 17:43.810
seemed at home with computers and the jargon and that sort of thing.

17:43.850 --> 17:45.790
So are you a computer freak?

17:47.290 --> 17:52.790
The interesting part of that is that when I wrote those books, all my

17:52.790 --> 17:57.030
knowledge of computers came from books, right?

17:57.230 --> 18:00.630
I had no real firsthand experience with computers.

18:01.250 --> 18:05.210
It was all from books and a lot of reading about them and what they could

18:05.210 --> 18:08.110
do and what they couldn't do, what the latest developments were.

18:09.450 --> 18:14.690
Having a year after I finished the third book, I now have my own home computer

18:14.690 --> 18:19.690
and I do my word processing and I think I would have a more difficult time now

18:21.190 --> 18:25.650
pulling it off the same way because I know too many specifics that I didn't

18:25.650 --> 18:26.510
know before, right?

18:26.790 --> 18:30.450
In a sense, I was safer with the generalities and approaching it that way.

18:30.890 --> 18:37.270
And I was safe from the language and syntax of talking about computers.

18:37.810 --> 18:42.310
And I've had several, one of the most pleasing things is reactions is I've

18:42.310 --> 18:48.930
had several computer programmers and program analysts tell me that they

18:48.930 --> 18:52.850
really enjoyed the computer part, which means that I did my job as a writer.

18:53.070 --> 18:56.630
I got through that part of it and yet I didn't slow everybody down with the

18:56.630 --> 18:57.210
technical ease.

18:57.310 --> 19:00.570
So I made it believable for the people who knew and understood and I also

19:00.570 --> 19:04.310
made it acceptable to the people who didn't and who aren't comfortable with it.

19:04.990 --> 19:10.750
Are there any modern day precedents for the linguistic analysis by computers

19:10.750 --> 19:12.690
and the poetry analysis by computers?

19:15.390 --> 19:17.650
Very crude ones at this stage of the game.

19:17.650 --> 19:20.190
But there's been work that's been done on that.

19:22.730 --> 19:27.010
Several universities have done experimental programming with programming

19:27.010 --> 19:32.570
computers to write poetry, programming computers to translate poetry.

19:34.270 --> 19:36.430
And it's all at a very crude level.

19:36.510 --> 19:39.610
So my extrapolation of that is a big stretch.

19:39.950 --> 19:45.070
But I thought given the progress of technology that in 7000 years it seemed

19:45.070 --> 19:46.970
reasonable that we'd figure out how to do it.

19:48.190 --> 19:49.550
I might just do that.

19:49.670 --> 19:49.910
Okay.

19:50.550 --> 19:56.430
And whenever Manly was in the Fed Center rehab, he teaches a little class in

19:56.430 --> 19:56.730
writing.

19:57.310 --> 20:00.930
And the reason was that it was to help the guests put some of their thoughts and

20:00.930 --> 20:02.870
feelings down on paper for therapy.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.490
Is writing kind of therapeutic to you?

20:07.110 --> 20:08.690
Yeah, it's a form of therapy.

20:08.890 --> 20:10.110
It's a form of catharsis.

20:11.070 --> 20:15.230
It's a way of exercising your own demons.

20:16.310 --> 20:20.470
You get to take this demon and give it to someone else and make them deal with it.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.250
And then you get it out of your own head and you don't have to worry about it.

20:23.350 --> 20:27.470
And then if it gets loose with them and runs over them, that's okay, because it's

20:27.470 --> 20:28.410
them, it's not you.

20:29.110 --> 20:30.910
And so yeah, it's always been that way for me.

20:31.050 --> 20:35.510
Poetry was that way especially because it's an extremely emotional form when

20:35.510 --> 20:35.990
you're young.

20:36.710 --> 20:41.270
And so it allows you to get, allows you a place to let go of those emotions where

20:41.270 --> 20:44.070
otherwise you might not have a socially acceptable outlet.

20:44.790 --> 20:46.630
So it's always been that for me.

20:47.070 --> 20:52.170
Has there ever been any precedent for psychologists using writing for people

20:52.170 --> 20:55.650
that have been through bad situations to exercise their demons like?

20:55.790 --> 20:56.210
Oh, yes.

20:56.510 --> 20:56.750
Yes.

20:56.970 --> 20:57.130
Yes.

20:57.310 --> 21:05.830
In fact, I participated in a course that was very, that was partially based on

21:05.830 --> 21:10.410
an idea at the Federal Correctional Institute in Fort Worth, where we got all

21:10.410 --> 21:14.790
these minimum security prisoners to work out some of their demons and creative

21:14.790 --> 21:15.170
writing.

21:15.810 --> 21:20.930
And the scene, the whole thing on pleasant when Gerard is in the rehab center is

21:20.930 --> 21:24.350
based on some things that we did when I was down at Fort Hood, where they had a

21:24.350 --> 21:32.470
little program for long term rehabilitation, rehabilitation patients in the

21:32.470 --> 21:35.590
hospital at Fort Hood, where they were doing some of that.

21:35.690 --> 21:37.430
And then I got to participate in a little bit of that program.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.870
And that's where the idea came from.

21:42.850 --> 21:43.250
Okay.

21:44.090 --> 21:47.910
Flexing the war, Delta, I guess I should, is it Shereel?

21:48.010 --> 21:48.950
I called her Shereel.

21:49.190 --> 21:49.970
That's, that's it.

21:50.330 --> 21:50.550
That's it.

21:50.690 --> 21:50.910
Okay.

21:50.990 --> 21:51.190
Good.

21:51.530 --> 21:54.330
I realized that that's the first time I'd ever pronounced that word aloud.

21:55.490 --> 22:00.170
Flexing the war dealt a great deal with Shereel's pregnancy and I've been through

22:00.170 --> 22:00.950
two pregnancies.

22:01.630 --> 22:03.450
So it was very real.

22:03.630 --> 22:07.950
And most science fiction books, I mean, you either use the auto woman or something

22:07.950 --> 22:12.670
or it's no big deal, but it, but there was a lot of human, human emotion and love

22:12.670 --> 22:13.450
and that sort of thing.

22:13.510 --> 22:14.350
And I hadn't seen it before.

22:14.490 --> 22:16.110
Have you been through first hand pregnancy?

22:16.470 --> 22:17.610
I mean, it's very realistically.

22:17.950 --> 22:18.270
Yes.

22:18.590 --> 22:18.850
Yes.

22:19.130 --> 22:19.250
Yes.

22:20.890 --> 22:24.110
Through the, through the pregnancy and through a miscarriage before it.

22:24.790 --> 22:27.930
So that I took all that and, you know, you write what you know.

22:27.930 --> 22:31.310
And so I put that in there because those were, those were very important times

22:31.310 --> 22:32.990
of my life when they happened.

22:33.690 --> 22:37.410
I was there when my daughter was born in the delivery room and that's why we got,

22:37.510 --> 22:40.850
you know, we got to have the, the big group scene when, when Serena is born.

22:41.090 --> 22:43.750
And I thought, you know, everybody ought to get to share this experience

22:43.750 --> 22:45.670
because it was really, it was really a lot of fun.

22:46.150 --> 22:50.970
And I, one of those, again, one of those gratifying things is to have a fan come

22:50.970 --> 22:55.050
up and say, you know, gee, I really liked, you know, female fans, especially.

22:55.270 --> 22:56.410
You really got that down.

22:56.410 --> 22:59.810
I really understand that our husbands come up and say, my wife was like

22:59.810 --> 23:00.650
that when she was pregnant.

23:02.510 --> 23:05.870
I mean, Joy makes a wonderful comment in there that he, you know, maybe women

23:05.870 --> 23:08.110
change species when they're pregnant.

23:08.830 --> 23:10.910
There's some biological basis for that.

23:11.450 --> 23:13.030
I read that all after my wife.

23:13.850 --> 23:19.670
My secretary, in fact, she looks to me for, for what can she read in science fiction?

23:19.890 --> 23:20.950
Cause she's not well versed.

23:21.050 --> 23:24.590
So I recommended these and told her it was a, it was really a love story,

23:24.630 --> 23:26.230
especially saying, well, she was just amazed.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.950
Science fiction could be a love story.

23:28.150 --> 23:28.650
Oh, really?

23:28.830 --> 23:29.930
And she's going to read it.

23:30.090 --> 23:34.810
So I'm anxious to see her reaction to it.

23:35.590 --> 23:36.430
Um, okay.

23:36.510 --> 23:37.290
I have a comment.

23:37.510 --> 23:41.190
So I'm going to, I'm going to, I say the series is a people story.

23:41.190 --> 23:42.310
It's not a hardware story.

23:42.710 --> 23:49.910
Uh, you don't, you don't explain your warps, uh, the ghosts, uh, how, why

23:49.910 --> 23:53.470
there's so many cross fertile bipeds around us, where they're just there.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.030
And we just accept that.

23:55.130 --> 23:56.930
And then I have parenthetically my applause.

23:57.510 --> 24:02.270
Um, do you consider, uh, okay.

24:02.330 --> 24:05.290
Did you ever think about explaining these things or you just decide,

24:05.930 --> 24:09.930
hang on, make this a science fiction book and we're not going to explain all

24:09.930 --> 24:14.470
this shit, how the, how we do this and that people know it's a book.

24:14.730 --> 24:19.810
So, yeah, I did what a great number of science fiction writers do.

24:19.930 --> 24:22.470
And that is, I, I built on what had gone before.

24:22.930 --> 24:26.870
And there was, there's, there's such a huge basis now of groundwork that has

24:26.870 --> 24:31.050
been done for us that we don't have to spend a lot of time explaining how

24:31.050 --> 24:32.750
this works and how that works.

24:33.070 --> 24:36.150
And, you know, oh, actually this warp takes us through techie on space,

24:36.290 --> 24:37.850
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

24:38.090 --> 24:43.290
We can just use keywords, uh, and key concepts and the reader has already

24:43.290 --> 24:44.310
been grounded in that.

24:45.610 --> 24:49.290
And then you can spend more time telling the story instead of having more

24:49.290 --> 24:52.850
time, spend more time explaining all the, all the mechanical functions.

24:53.430 --> 24:57.570
Uh, there's a hard science, there's a big hard science story that I really

24:57.570 --> 25:00.370
want to write, but I don't think I have the skills yet as a writer to do it.

25:00.410 --> 25:05.430
So I'm saving that one for when I'm, when I'm better trained in my craft.

25:06.850 --> 25:07.290
Okay.

25:07.430 --> 25:12.630
Manly also dreams a lot or so a lot of them, maybe flashbacks and things, but,

25:12.690 --> 25:16.330
but there are dreams and he replaced the dream that wouldn't be nice to be able

25:16.330 --> 25:21.570
to do that, to keep replaying and focusing on the details and he interprets them.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.210
But do you dream a lot?

25:23.390 --> 25:25.130
Did this, uh, this has happened to you?

25:26.670 --> 25:32.150
I dreamed a great deal from the time I, well, from somewhere in the middle

25:32.150 --> 25:37.190
of Vietnam, uh, until about six, seven years afterward.

25:37.550 --> 25:40.430
And I think that's the major influence on George dreams.

25:41.210 --> 25:46.230
Uh, and they were very vivid and they were very recallable in the same

25:46.230 --> 25:49.750
way that he recalls them where I could, I could, they would start as fragments

25:49.750 --> 25:52.250
when I woke up and then I could, I could pull them back.

25:52.690 --> 25:54.770
I could bring more pieces back into the dream.

25:55.970 --> 26:00.230
That kind of faded off after about six, seven years after I got back from Vietnam.

26:00.230 --> 26:05.130
And I don't do nearly as much of it, but that's where it came from.

26:05.430 --> 26:06.910
That, that process came from.

26:07.250 --> 26:11.050
And then in Gerard's case, it's, it's, it's part of what he suspects.

26:11.050 --> 26:16.850
And it's, it's, he's getting a mirror image of what was a prescient talent.

26:17.110 --> 26:20.350
And his prescientism is in effect kind of turned around and giving him a

26:20.350 --> 26:24.170
way to look back into his past warped by the mind wipers.

26:26.070 --> 26:26.510
Okay.

26:27.270 --> 26:31.190
Um, at this point, I'll ask you then, uh, how's the tape doing?

26:32.490 --> 26:37.030
The, uh, the cover, uh, I, Gerard doesn't look like that to me.

26:37.190 --> 26:38.250
No, captain space.

26:38.610 --> 26:38.750
Get it.

26:38.750 --> 26:39.670
The real is not right.

26:39.790 --> 26:43.810
Except I noticed there's one detail that she didn't have this little, it looks

26:43.810 --> 26:48.110
like after the fact penciled on tank top story.

26:48.530 --> 26:50.370
Now I'm not an art critic.

26:50.550 --> 26:53.930
What do you think that that might have been an add on a little, a little red tank top?

26:54.310 --> 26:59.890
Cause otherwise she looks just, she has little stars and little skirt and all that,

27:00.110 --> 27:01.970
but that looks like it might have been added.

27:02.350 --> 27:07.270
So what, I liked, I liked Larkin's interpretation of Cherelle, but her

27:07.270 --> 27:08.850
idea is interpretation of Gerard.

27:09.350 --> 27:11.950
I mean Gerard, what little description you get.

27:12.030 --> 27:16.310
He's getting a little pot belly and he's getting a little bald and he doesn't

27:16.310 --> 27:21.710
look like captain space cadet, but when they showed me the original cover,

27:21.910 --> 27:26.130
which did not have a little red tank top, I said, for my five years

27:26.130 --> 27:29.010
experience in book hoe sailing, you're going to have a problem selling this

27:29.010 --> 27:35.610
book because book hoe sailors are on the whole more conservative in their

27:35.610 --> 27:37.610
buying habits than bookstores.

27:38.770 --> 27:40.270
And they said, Oh no, no, no, don't worry about it.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.150
And I said, you're going to have a problem.

27:42.230 --> 27:42.770
They said, don't worry about it.

27:42.810 --> 27:44.510
We want to hear it's too late to change it.

27:44.670 --> 27:48.670
When one of the largest wholesalers in the country who had sold about 3,500

27:48.670 --> 27:54.050
copies of the first book refused to order the second book, they literally

27:54.050 --> 27:57.450
stopped the presses while the book was printed.

27:57.570 --> 28:00.450
They hadn't bound it yet, but they had printed 90,000 covers.

28:01.110 --> 28:05.150
They trashed 90,000 covers, pulled the artwork, put on this little red

28:05.150 --> 28:09.290
acetate tank top, reshot the cover and reprinted it.

28:10.090 --> 28:12.630
And then in order to go out and sell it to these people who had refused to

28:12.630 --> 28:16.390
buy it, you know, originally they shot Xeroxes of it and the red acetate

28:16.390 --> 28:17.850
turns black on the Xerox, of course.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.190
So it looks like she's all covered up.

28:19.450 --> 28:22.270
So everybody bought the book then and then they, when it came in and they,

28:22.330 --> 28:24.770
and they put it out, so many people started looking at, you can see through

28:24.770 --> 28:25.010
that.

28:25.210 --> 28:30.390
So it's a rather bizarre story, but the things that happen on covers are bizarre.

28:30.730 --> 28:30.830
Right.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.030
The cover of the third book has nothing to do with the story.

28:36.230 --> 28:39.690
And the woman looks just like, I mean, looks just like Sheryl,

28:39.850 --> 28:41.010
except it's supposed to be Ferry Peg.

28:41.550 --> 28:44.150
And here's the grand high muckety muck of Ribble Galaxy, you know, the

28:44.150 --> 28:47.910
number one titular head of the whole place who never gets naked, except when

28:47.910 --> 28:49.050
she gets in the bathtub, right?

28:49.350 --> 28:51.790
Standing there on a loincloth and a halter top, right?

28:52.070 --> 28:52.570
There's three?

28:52.930 --> 28:53.390
No, two.

28:53.710 --> 28:54.590
She only has two.

28:54.770 --> 28:55.410
Yeah, she only has two.

28:55.970 --> 28:56.330
Yeah.

28:56.570 --> 28:57.270
Yeah, I've got it here.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.710
Well, let's look at our radio.

28:59.950 --> 29:00.370
Yeah, yeah.

29:00.830 --> 29:03.390
We'll show that we, we'll hold this up to the microphone.

29:03.390 --> 29:06.970
So all the whole radio audience can see what it looks like.

29:09.390 --> 29:13.170
But it looks almost like Teresa in the face.

29:16.370 --> 29:16.810
Wow.

29:17.850 --> 29:18.290
Okay.

29:18.810 --> 29:22.510
Did any, did any cover, would there accidentally be a dozen or so copies

29:22.510 --> 29:25.250
without the little acetate tank top that got out?

29:25.570 --> 29:27.470
No, there were some copies of the cover.

29:27.790 --> 29:28.230
Right.

29:28.330 --> 29:31.650
I have, I think I have three or four copies of the cover without the tank top.

29:31.650 --> 29:33.230
So you have a hang on to those.

29:33.390 --> 29:37.730
Yeah, but the best part was they, the bookstore at the University of Texas

29:37.730 --> 29:41.930
in Arlington asked them for a blow up of the cover to do a big window display

29:41.930 --> 29:44.790
because I used to work there and they give me a big promotion for each book.

29:45.150 --> 29:48.490
And when they did the blow up, they did the original artwork without the tank top.

29:48.490 --> 29:50.810
And when the manager of the store saw it, he said, we can't put that in the window,

29:50.970 --> 29:51.110
right?

29:51.510 --> 29:53.470
I mean, it's things like 24 by 36.

29:53.690 --> 29:54.870
He said, we can't put this in the window.

29:55.350 --> 29:58.970
So they took it back to the, to the, to the art department and they cut out a

29:58.970 --> 30:02.530
little red acetate blouse and they just kind of slapped it on there and stuck it

30:02.530 --> 30:02.910
in the window.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.390
So I have, I have a blow up of the original.

30:09.430 --> 30:09.890
Okay.

30:10.230 --> 30:11.770
You, do you work part time now?

30:11.870 --> 30:12.470
Is that for Bantam?

30:12.710 --> 30:14.810
I know I used, I did until February.

30:14.890 --> 30:16.550
I worked part time for Bantam.

30:16.570 --> 30:21.430
Was there any coincidence that you worked for Bantam and Bantam published your novels?

30:22.110 --> 30:23.370
No, no.

30:26.110 --> 30:31.530
It, it might have helped in, in, in getting it read because when I wrote to Karen Haas

30:31.530 --> 30:35.330
at Bantam, I noted, I told her that I was working part time for Bantam.

30:35.430 --> 30:38.730
So it probably didn't hurt in getting it read, but she wouldn't have bothered if it,

30:38.950 --> 30:40.510
just because I worked for Bantam.

30:41.870 --> 30:43.470
It was nice working for Bantam.

30:43.570 --> 30:46.270
When the books came out though, because you helped get distributed your own book.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.750
I was putting books at the Osford, Worth airport.

30:48.990 --> 30:53.050
So my book got on the bestseller rack and, you know, it's, you know, it's good.

30:53.050 --> 30:55.770
You know, it was, it was great in terms of sales of the book.

30:55.930 --> 31:00.670
I mean, we sold an enormous number of books at the DFW airport because we put them all

31:00.670 --> 31:04.010
out there and mass numbers on the rack, which sells X number of books anyway.

31:04.250 --> 31:07.810
And then I autographed every one of those crazy things and put little tags on there

31:07.810 --> 31:09.330
to tell people that they were autographed.

31:09.770 --> 31:13.850
He was telling me that he was, he was through the airport and saw the autographed book.

31:14.830 --> 31:16.550
I wondered what, how they did happen.

31:18.070 --> 31:22.610
There's another, there's an interesting, I guess it's a market employee.

31:22.610 --> 31:25.810
And these books I had not seen before, maybe it's just because I haven't seen

31:25.810 --> 31:30.770
that many varieties of books, but where you have excerpts from the next book in there.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.010
Did you, did you have a hand in there?

31:33.050 --> 31:34.470
No, no, that's Bantam.

31:35.090 --> 31:38.430
Well, Bantam has been doing it for, for some number of years.

31:39.530 --> 31:47.050
They will do excerpts from one book, like one Western and another Western.

31:48.570 --> 31:52.290
Sometimes they will do one particular mainstream novel that they're pushing

31:52.290 --> 31:57.030
hard, it's going to be a lead title they'll do in books for two or three months preceding.

31:57.090 --> 31:58.510
They'll put a little excerpt in the back.

32:01.250 --> 32:05.010
I don't know, I can't think off the top of my head of any other series where they've

32:05.010 --> 32:06.150
done that same kind of thing.

32:07.410 --> 32:09.170
But they just said, we're going to do it.

32:09.530 --> 32:10.610
And I said, that's fine.

32:10.750 --> 32:14.650
The only, my only objection is that those are never, they're never corrected.

32:15.290 --> 32:17.550
They're never the corrected manuscript that they use.

32:17.610 --> 32:20.050
So it's full of typos and all kinds of crazy things.

32:20.050 --> 32:21.110
And they just stick it in the back.

32:22.870 --> 32:26.050
It is, at least on the first one was called the Windhover trilogy.

32:26.550 --> 32:29.470
And as George said, it's, I think, I don't think they ever did.

32:29.590 --> 32:30.810
I think they always called it a series.

32:31.010 --> 32:31.750
Okay. Yeah.

32:31.930 --> 32:34.010
I called it a trilogy fool that I was.

32:34.150 --> 32:36.410
I called it a trilogy because that's how I thought about it.

32:36.430 --> 32:37.750
But they always called it a series.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.930
Why did you decide to go on with another one?

32:40.090 --> 32:41.390
But it's just necessary for.

32:42.310 --> 32:44.030
Or is it Anne McCaffrey?

32:44.250 --> 32:45.330
It's Anne McCaffrey's fault.

32:45.490 --> 32:46.430
I'm not blaming on any.

32:46.850 --> 32:50.630
She wrote after she, she has read all the books in manuscript now.

32:51.010 --> 32:53.050
I went after she finished the third book.

32:53.170 --> 32:56.150
She wrote me this long, long letter asking me this whole list of questions.

32:56.310 --> 32:58.490
She said, you have answered all the main questions in the story.

32:58.570 --> 33:01.810
I'm not objecting to that, but I want to know this and I want to know that.

33:01.990 --> 33:03.170
I want to know this and I want to know that.

33:03.250 --> 33:04.570
And are you ever going to talk about this?

33:04.710 --> 33:05.590
And are you ever going to talk about that?

33:06.030 --> 33:09.010
And she said, either write me a long letter back or write another book.

33:10.230 --> 33:14.030
So I laughingly shared that letter with my editor and.

33:15.750 --> 33:18.650
Started thinking about the answers to those questions, but it hadn't gotten

33:18.650 --> 33:21.730
beyond that point until the first book started to sell really well.

33:22.310 --> 33:24.770
And then my editor said, gee, you ought to think about the fourth book.

33:25.190 --> 33:28.530
And I said, well, the only way I'll do a fourth book if it's the final book,

33:28.530 --> 33:30.470
because I don't want an endless series.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.910
If I can make this the final book and under these conditions, then I will,

33:34.990 --> 33:37.070
I will write it and I will answer Annie's question.

33:37.630 --> 33:40.330
So the fourth book is going to be to answer any questions.

33:41.230 --> 33:42.990
I mean, that's what started the whole thing.

33:43.870 --> 33:44.850
Dan McCaffrey's fault.

33:46.090 --> 33:46.690
Buzzer heart.

33:47.570 --> 33:51.850
You have, you apparently have other things going on now.

33:52.350 --> 33:54.650
Science fiction, I assume science fiction works.

33:55.370 --> 33:57.090
Would you want to share any of that with us?

33:57.230 --> 33:58.050
What you're working on?

33:59.690 --> 34:06.350
Yeah, I finished a book in October with a man who's been my best friend

34:06.350 --> 34:10.210
since we were 12 years old, Ralph Mylis, called the Sarencennacles,

34:10.250 --> 34:11.950
which has nothing to do with the series.

34:12.730 --> 34:15.570
It has to do with Ralph spending three years in the desert in Saudi Arabia

34:15.570 --> 34:18.330
and baking his brain and coming back and thinking he wanted to write

34:18.330 --> 34:21.250
science fiction after 20 years as being a successful accountant.

34:22.570 --> 34:26.190
And I'll have better sense in that and understanding the financial side of this world.

34:27.210 --> 34:31.410
We wrote that in, took most of last year to write that.

34:32.490 --> 34:38.870
I just finished the fourth book in the series, finished the next little

34:38.870 --> 34:41.070
last draft right before I came here to AggieCon.

34:41.930 --> 34:46.890
And I have a proposal in front of Bandim now for a new series called

34:46.890 --> 34:52.750
the Double Spiral War, which is going to involve a lot of my experiences

34:52.750 --> 34:55.750
in Vietnam, but also a lot of my reading on wars in general.

34:58.930 --> 35:05.950
It's really a kind of, it's a 485,000 story about a war, but it breaks neatly

35:05.950 --> 35:11.190
into five sections because of the scope of the war.

35:12.870 --> 35:19.310
And it's a viewpoint on war that I wanted to use in telling a story

35:19.310 --> 35:22.950
about a war that I really haven't seen done the way I wanted it to do.

35:23.430 --> 35:24.890
And why, what the way I wanted it done.

35:25.310 --> 35:27.990
So that's probably going to be my next project.

35:28.210 --> 35:34.230
Is it going to be closer to forever war or build with Lactic Hero or Starship Troopers

35:34.790 --> 35:36.850
or it's going to be something different?

35:37.390 --> 35:39.190
Well, I hope it's going to be something different.

35:41.650 --> 35:49.110
Just the first, the first chapter in the first book opens up with the leader

35:49.110 --> 35:55.250
of the opposition, who by the end of that chapter has become a very sympathetic

35:55.250 --> 36:02.210
character. I expect the readers to really like him because he is a very human

36:05.450 --> 36:10.670
compassionate individual, but because of what happens to him and because personally

36:10.670 --> 36:15.110
and politically. I mean, he ends up being the antagonist.

36:15.150 --> 36:16.790
He's on the wrong side of the fence.

36:17.910 --> 36:21.610
But part of what I want to do is to show that you can be on the wrong side of the

36:21.610 --> 36:23.310
fence and be a good guy, quote unquote.

36:24.130 --> 36:30.610
You can be a lovable, likable human being with all those positive traits we think

36:30.610 --> 36:38.410
of in people and be on the wrong side in the wrong place and end up having to pay

36:38.410 --> 36:45.430
for it. And so I'm starting that book from the viewpoint of this very likable

36:45.430 --> 36:46.270
antagonist.

36:50.490 --> 36:52.990
Okay, I'll ask you kind of a general question.

36:52.990 --> 37:03.710
And you distributed books, whatever your job with Ballantyne was, what's the

37:03.710 --> 37:09.070
future going to be like for the genre of science fiction next five or 10 years?

37:09.390 --> 37:11.370
Books are getting pre-dammed expensive.

37:12.630 --> 37:16.510
You don't just go in and save your pocket change, buy them anymore.

37:17.450 --> 37:23.130
Is there going to be more, fewer big companies, but fewer companies controlling

37:23.130 --> 37:25.750
all publishing? What is your outlook on it?

37:26.590 --> 37:28.430
All right, excuse me.

37:28.450 --> 37:28.990
I don't know.

37:29.930 --> 37:35.130
I've been in the book business since 1969 and I've decided that the only constant

37:35.130 --> 37:42.170
is change. And I've decided that if a rumor comes along about some change in the

37:42.170 --> 37:45.570
industry, the more absurd the rumor, the better its chances of coming true.

37:46.990 --> 37:51.470
It's extremely difficult industry to predict on a short term basis.

37:51.650 --> 37:55.470
It looks to me like for a short term, we are going to have fewer companies,

37:55.650 --> 38:06.330
fewer markets, more formula type science fiction, less science fiction that

38:06.330 --> 38:08.910
stretches, that reaches out.

38:08.970 --> 38:10.290
But I think that will change.

38:10.450 --> 38:11.910
I don't think that's a permanent condition.

38:12.030 --> 38:14.550
I think that's part of the temporary flux that the market is in.

38:15.250 --> 38:18.230
I think we will see houses like Tor get stronger.

38:18.950 --> 38:20.830
They are very financially stable.

38:21.030 --> 38:22.970
They have done well with the books that they've done.

38:23.070 --> 38:23.870
They will get stronger.

38:24.330 --> 38:29.050
I think other smaller companies will in one way or another begin to fill the

38:29.050 --> 38:32.110
vacuum that's been left by all this conglomeratization.

38:33.330 --> 38:38.150
And that we will see again another expansion, whether it takes three years or

38:38.150 --> 38:39.490
five years, I have no way of knowing.

38:39.770 --> 38:41.330
But I think we'll see another expansion.

38:41.970 --> 38:45.030
The thing that scares me is what you mentioned first, and that is the price of

38:45.030 --> 38:45.310
the books.

38:45.790 --> 38:49.190
I figured out when I was running a retail store about seven, eight years ago that

38:50.490 --> 38:53.990
somewhere in the like 1990 that the average paperback book was going to cost

38:53.990 --> 38:54.850
$10.97.

38:55.430 --> 38:59.410
But then the average retail clerk at the same time was going to be make like

38:59.410 --> 39:00.690
2250 an hour.

39:00.690 --> 39:01.730
All right.

39:01.970 --> 39:05.030
If assuming it's a certain level of inflation.

39:07.210 --> 39:11.770
The question is, will we be able to overcome those same psychological barriers

39:11.770 --> 39:14.830
that we overcame with gasoline and the rising price of bread?

39:15.690 --> 39:18.970
I mean, I can remember buying bread for 10 cents a loaf and I can remember buying

39:18.970 --> 39:20.370
gas for 17 cents a gallon.

39:21.130 --> 39:21.150
Right.

39:22.070 --> 39:26.930
Now, you know, we rejoice if we can get gas and then 91 cents, 89 cents and

39:26.930 --> 39:29.790
everybody rushes to the corner for 89 cents a gallon gasoline and it'll go back

39:29.790 --> 39:30.990
up to a dollar or something again.

39:31.470 --> 39:35.330
And if we can overcome that psychological barrier of 10.97 for a paperback,

39:36.530 --> 39:38.790
maybe, maybe we'll survive, but I don't know.

39:39.050 --> 39:42.590
That's the part that scares me is the inflation prices as much as anything

39:42.590 --> 39:42.870
else.

39:42.930 --> 39:46.390
But I think what part of what we'll see is more and more of a shift over to the

39:46.390 --> 39:50.690
trade paperbacks that they will take the place of most of the hard covers

39:51.250 --> 39:55.990
because the hard covers will just get too expensive and people regardless of the

39:55.990 --> 40:00.370
ratio, people will just be unwilling to pay hard cover prices.

40:00.370 --> 40:02.930
So we'll see more trade paper.

40:03.250 --> 40:09.010
We'll see more new books done in trade paper by lesser known authors that

40:09.010 --> 40:12.250
might have been done in hard cover at one time by double day or Berkeley or

40:12.250 --> 40:13.010
someone else.

40:13.930 --> 40:16.450
And that may take some of the pressure off the market.

40:17.250 --> 40:19.250
So trade paperbacks are here to stay?

40:19.610 --> 40:20.910
I think so, yes.

40:21.330 --> 40:25.410
I think I think the thing that will cinch it and I keep waiting for

40:26.030 --> 40:29.430
publishers are not very progressive people, but I keep waiting for the

40:29.430 --> 40:34.250
publishers to do and trade back, trade paper publishing what they did years and

40:34.250 --> 40:36.070
years ago in mass market publishing.

40:36.190 --> 40:40.290
And that is go to a standard size because what will cinch the market is when

40:40.290 --> 40:43.790
they go to a standard trade size, the same way they did with a mass market size,

40:43.890 --> 40:47.310
that means that all those places out there that you can put those books will

40:47.310 --> 40:51.670
go to a standard size rack, which means they can be handled in the same way,

40:51.690 --> 40:55.610
which means they can get much deeper into the distribution channels, which

40:55.610 --> 40:58.590
means they'll get much wider distribution and better sales.

40:58.590 --> 40:59.190
Right.

40:59.650 --> 41:04.350
And until they do that, until the publishers finally beat their heads

41:04.350 --> 41:07.970
against each other and are willing to settle on a size, they're going to limit

41:07.970 --> 41:09.530
the saleability of those things.

41:09.530 --> 41:10.310
But I think they will.

41:10.450 --> 41:12.390
I think the market will demand that they do that.

41:12.750 --> 41:15.190
And when they do, then we will see a new class.

41:15.570 --> 41:17.750
We will have an a sense mass market trade books.

41:18.690 --> 41:19.710
They will be bigger.

41:19.890 --> 41:25.030
They'll be slightly better bound, maybe slightly better paper, bigger type

41:25.030 --> 41:29.350
faces anyway, easier to read and they'll come in standard sizes and they'll show

41:29.350 --> 41:33.170
up in racks to be a rack of mass market books and a rack of trade books.

41:34.210 --> 41:36.210
And that's the direction I think they have to go.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.190
You remember all the different sizes mass market books.

41:38.350 --> 41:38.470
Yeah.

41:38.610 --> 41:43.970
You know, if you're any collector knows, right, they, as a collector, I know you

41:43.970 --> 41:48.790
said in one book that it looks like that's that may trade paperbacks may save

41:48.790 --> 41:50.890
the industry, but as a collector, I hate you.

41:51.510 --> 41:52.970
But if they're here, they're here.

41:52.970 --> 41:53.690
I like it.

41:53.730 --> 41:59.290
But yeah, I have, I have Larry Newman's, the magic goes away.

41:59.510 --> 42:03.150
And it's, damn it's, I could barely get it on my shelf and then I've got some

42:03.150 --> 42:05.550
little ones and there's all different sizes.

42:06.370 --> 42:10.630
Well, if you look, even, even with the standardization of size on mass market

42:10.630 --> 42:13.690
books, if you look at mass market books, they are different sizes, right?

42:13.910 --> 42:16.450
Not widths, but heights, right?

42:17.110 --> 42:19.650
Ban, even in the Bantam line, there are different heights.

42:19.650 --> 42:24.570
And what they have started to do is they've knocked off like an eight or three

42:24.570 --> 42:29.630
sixteenths of an inch from what was their standard height because they figured

42:29.630 --> 42:34.490
if they, if they knocked off three sixteenths of an inch on each book and

42:34.490 --> 42:39.630
they were doing a printing of 250,000 books that for the same amount of money,

42:39.630 --> 42:43.150
they were getting like an extra 5,000 books out of the same roll of paper.

42:43.830 --> 42:45.830
Now, paper's gotten extremely expensive, right?

42:46.530 --> 42:50.870
So if you can get an extra 5,000 books out of that same roll of paper, right?

42:51.130 --> 42:55.030
You've saved some money and it's, but it really messes up your shelf when you

42:55.030 --> 42:57.790
have a series and they stair step along the shelf.

42:58.910 --> 43:03.330
I have two copies of Bill DeGalactico, the first edition that Harry signed

43:03.330 --> 43:07.490
yesterday and one of them is at least a quarter of an inch is not more higher.

43:07.690 --> 43:11.530
I mean, they, it's the same edition of the same book, same printing.

43:11.530 --> 43:12.030
Yeah.

43:12.050 --> 43:14.690
And Ace Doubles, my Ace Doubles.

43:14.870 --> 43:15.070
Yeah.

43:15.150 --> 43:16.870
Kind of stair step like that too.

43:17.150 --> 43:17.590
It's interesting.

43:17.890 --> 43:18.650
Jagged Peaks.

43:19.050 --> 43:20.610
Any questions, Mr. Carson?

43:21.790 --> 43:22.390
Hmm.

43:23.250 --> 43:24.330
No, no.

43:24.670 --> 43:26.390
Well, maybe one.

43:29.210 --> 43:31.110
You didn't ask me writing questions.

43:32.570 --> 43:34.890
No, no mechanics thereof.

43:35.330 --> 43:37.370
Just a few mechanics type questions.

43:37.370 --> 43:42.910
Whenever you start to write something like the windhover, what came first?

43:43.350 --> 43:48.470
Characters, plot, character with a problem.

43:50.190 --> 43:54.410
That's, that's how most of my stories begin as character with a problem.

43:55.330 --> 43:59.250
I write short stories that are unsayable because the characters have

43:59.250 --> 44:04.230
problems that are either so bizarre or so obscene.

44:06.250 --> 44:10.610
Or something else that even though the problem gets resolved by the end of the

44:10.610 --> 44:13.450
story that no one's really interested, that's fine because I just write them for

44:13.450 --> 44:13.730
fun.

44:13.830 --> 44:17.710
They're characters who pop into my head with this particular problem and I let

44:17.710 --> 44:21.250
them run through that section of their lives until they solve the problem and

44:21.250 --> 44:24.430
then they go back in the drawer and I've gotten them out of my head, which is the

44:24.430 --> 44:25.170
most important thing.

44:25.650 --> 44:33.890
But I start with a character with a problem and very shortly thereafter, I

44:33.890 --> 44:37.030
have two to three weeks for a novel length work.

44:37.430 --> 44:40.710
I have a very good idea of how the story ends.

44:41.830 --> 44:45.530
All right, so I have a beginning and an ending and the middle is just, it's like

44:45.530 --> 44:45.990
standing.

44:46.410 --> 44:49.130
I remember as a kid standing and the first time I went through Tennessee and

44:49.130 --> 44:53.230
standing on one of those overlooks and looking out across to the mountains on

44:53.230 --> 44:55.850
the other side and it was nothing but fog and mist in the bottom.

44:56.010 --> 44:58.450
Well, that's kind of how I feel when I get ready to start a novel.

44:58.870 --> 45:01.990
I know where I am and I know the mountain is on the other side, but what's in

45:01.990 --> 45:02.430
the middle there?

45:02.790 --> 45:05.190
I don't know, except you have to go down and you have to come back up in order

45:05.190 --> 45:05.630
to get there.

45:06.390 --> 45:11.510
And then that middle resolves itself in a very vague way as I begin the story.

45:12.650 --> 45:17.750
And I found the more that I try to put my characters through paces in the

45:17.750 --> 45:20.930
middle to do certain things, the less cooperative they become.

45:21.350 --> 45:24.930
So what I try to do then is tap them back in the line when they start pushing

45:24.930 --> 45:26.530
the plot too far away.

45:26.830 --> 45:28.430
I think I'll never get to the end this way.

45:28.490 --> 45:31.510
If you guys keep going left edge, little right, make me happy.

45:32.130 --> 45:34.850
So I'd nudge them back to the right a little bit and then they head back

45:34.850 --> 45:37.550
and then they go way off too far to the right and you have to nudge them back

45:37.550 --> 45:38.030
to the left.

45:38.750 --> 45:42.810
It's a strange process, especially when they come alive in the back of your

45:42.810 --> 45:45.730
head and they start saying things and doing things that you didn't expect them

45:45.730 --> 45:46.070
to do.

45:46.590 --> 45:48.630
Sheryl's pregnancy is a perfect example of that.

45:49.270 --> 45:52.210
I mean, she wasn't supposed to get pregnant for another six months in this

45:52.210 --> 45:54.670
story because I had to get them where they were going first, right?

45:55.050 --> 45:57.310
I was going to have her get pregnant someplace safe.

45:57.950 --> 46:01.110
Oh, no, she had to get pregnant and she and Gerard had to argue about it.

46:01.110 --> 46:02.770
And then I was angry at both of them.

46:02.830 --> 46:05.550
And then I had to back off and take five pages out of the manuscript, say,

46:05.570 --> 46:08.370
wait a minute, take them back to the beginning of that scene, say, it's your

46:08.370 --> 46:10.970
problem, you work it out, I'll write it down.

46:11.090 --> 46:12.230
You just tell me what's right now.

46:12.450 --> 46:15.550
And so I let them argue at the problem and solve their difficulties and it was

46:15.550 --> 46:15.990
all fine.

46:16.530 --> 46:18.690
And I learned a valuable lesson.

46:18.810 --> 46:22.330
Keep your cotton picking hands off their lives when they're doing it themselves.

46:23.350 --> 46:25.070
When they're struggling with it themselves.

46:26.230 --> 46:29.250
When you get your characters going, they become their own little entities.

46:29.850 --> 46:30.430
Oh, yes.

46:30.430 --> 46:31.190
Oh, yes.

46:31.410 --> 46:36.750
They, when Ralph and I did our book, one of the things that happened was we had,

46:36.850 --> 46:43.490
we started with a male protagonist and then a minor protagonist who was female.

46:44.670 --> 46:49.750
And she came alive for me about the same time that he came alive for Ralph.

46:50.610 --> 46:51.630
And so he was right.

46:51.750 --> 46:54.730
Ralph was writing the first draft and he was putting words in her mouth.

46:54.910 --> 46:57.370
And then when I was reading it and getting ready to write the second draft,

46:57.430 --> 46:58.870
she was in the back of my head screaming.

46:58.870 --> 47:00.270
No, no, no, I wouldn't say that.

47:00.270 --> 47:01.630
I wouldn't, I wouldn't react like that.

47:01.950 --> 47:05.350
So I'd get on the phone to Ralph and I'd say, Calissa says that she wouldn't

47:05.350 --> 47:06.230
react like this.

47:06.750 --> 47:09.330
And he said, well, we'll work it out tomorrow at our story conference.

47:09.410 --> 47:12.470
And we'd sit there for eight hours trying to hash out dialogue between a

47:12.470 --> 47:15.850
character who was alive in his head and a character who was alive in my head.

47:16.010 --> 47:21.030
And he had to have enough sense of that to go back then and write first draft

47:21.030 --> 47:24.830
material based on what I had told him about a character who was living in my

47:24.830 --> 47:25.070
head.

47:25.590 --> 47:28.670
The only thing that saved us was that some character didn't come alive that

47:28.670 --> 47:30.410
way for both of us, right?

47:30.570 --> 47:32.050
Who then would have been schizophrenic.

47:32.670 --> 47:35.350
He'd have been alive one way and Ralph said it another way in my head.

47:35.470 --> 47:37.050
We'd probably had to do something.

47:37.250 --> 47:38.650
We'd have to divide him into two characters.

47:40.710 --> 47:41.550
Bizarre, bizarre.

47:42.370 --> 47:42.750
Interesting.

47:43.070 --> 47:43.270
Yeah.

47:44.090 --> 47:44.410
Yeah.

47:44.610 --> 47:46.790
That's something that always ceases to amaze us.

47:47.230 --> 47:49.950
We never ceases to always ceases.

47:52.590 --> 47:57.510
Just the writing process and not being writers, but being extremely interested

47:57.510 --> 47:58.190
in the process.

47:58.550 --> 48:01.530
And we've heard time and time again how the characters just take over and

48:01.530 --> 48:03.070
that's just that blows us away.

48:03.390 --> 48:07.230
I can think of characters and I can think of stories and that's where it stops.
