WEBVTT

00:06.360 --> 00:14.040
It's only costing me about $3 to get 30 copies of say 6 10 page fans in Anzapa.

00:14.500 --> 00:20.020
I can afford $3 but I can't afford what Bruce is spending on this and Bruce is unemployed

00:20.020 --> 00:20.700
at the moment.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.980
He's supposed to be going overseas and he's also furnishing a new house.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.940
I'm not that dedicated.

00:31.060 --> 00:37.820
So the panel obviously doesn't think then that the possibility of video cassette fans

00:37.820 --> 00:38.480
ends is on.

00:38.660 --> 00:39.720
I think it's quite likely now.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.540
Just imagine it's very good.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.440
You can have it.

00:44.440 --> 00:48.580
The members are now in the hands of the alternative culture.

00:48.860 --> 00:51.180
They will not go back to the people who put up the money.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.960
In another two years you will probably be able to get the money back.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.080
I think it's viable.

01:01.740 --> 01:07.160
At the World Convention last year there was a section on the techniques.

01:07.500 --> 01:13.260
A whole session in the convention very very popular on the techniques of animation.

01:14.220 --> 01:16.800
This was a terrific crowd getter.

01:17.620 --> 01:20.160
The videotape at the moment is unreal to fandom.

01:20.800 --> 01:28.020
I'm lucky because I'm studying videotape and things like that and I have access to

01:28.020 --> 01:28.900
machines and tape.

01:29.260 --> 01:30.300
It doesn't cost much.

01:31.260 --> 01:32.660
But yeah, that's what it is.

01:32.980 --> 01:37.820
Sir, are we talking about fandom or communication technology?

01:37.920 --> 01:38.260
Oh god.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.420
We're talking about communication.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.920
We're talking about communication amongst bands.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.580
That's right.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.500
Practicality of communication.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.160
As a matter of fact, the best method of communication amongst bands isn't fan-seeing

01:52.160 --> 01:52.580
at all.

01:52.740 --> 01:53.840
It's only one side of it.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.020
The other one is conventions.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.640
For those people who would like to have a bird's-eye view of the Australian conventions,

02:00.840 --> 02:05.420
I've got the Australian Convention handbooks here as from the National Convention number

02:05.420 --> 02:05.860
three.

02:07.420 --> 02:11.180
And if anybody would like to have a look at these after the panel, I've got only two

02:11.180 --> 02:12.700
left to be able to give to them.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.820
It's now the 19th Somerset Place Melbourne.

02:17.100 --> 02:17.980
You may have remembered.

02:19.120 --> 02:25.500
This is Eastercon 72, the 10th Australian Science Fiction Convention at Melbourne University,

02:25.720 --> 02:27.940
cheaply memorable for the complete absence of laboratories.

02:31.700 --> 02:38.260
Eastercon 73, Mini-Melcon 71, Etherline 2, Journal of the Melbourne Science Fiction.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.100
I don't believe it.

02:39.320 --> 02:39.500
Never was.

02:39.500 --> 02:45.660
Eastercon 1968, 7th Australian Science Fiction Convention 1966, which started off the modern

02:45.660 --> 02:46.160
Renaissance.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.000
Bow, everybody.

02:49.480 --> 02:50.580
Bow your heads in reverence.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.060
The Wolf Convention Program book for last year.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.380
Containing Harlan Ellison's signature.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.200
Oh, wow.

03:03.860 --> 03:05.780
It's a small signature too.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.260
Can you stand in there, sir?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.460
It also has to put his hand prints in there.

03:13.660 --> 03:17.440
Art Plate from the 9th Australian Science Fiction Convention handbook.

03:18.420 --> 03:19.220
I knew it.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.080
Yes, Lou?

03:24.640 --> 03:25.080
20 questions.

03:29.860 --> 03:35.300
Yes, Lou?

03:35.300 --> 03:36.600
I've got a fan.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.080
Now, this thing called communication.

03:39.640 --> 03:46.780
Is it more important to them to communicate and give feedback, or have they considered

03:47.700 --> 03:49.100
writing in other fields?

03:49.240 --> 03:51.860
What their attitude would be to writing in these other fields?

03:52.000 --> 03:58.600
Would they decline to write, say, a column in a newspaper or some other magazine?

03:58.880 --> 04:00.600
Railway, but lack of sleep.

04:02.460 --> 04:07.700
Yeah, well, I for one have thought of the idea of writing professionally.

04:08.780 --> 04:09.540
Hasn't everybody.

04:10.720 --> 04:15.860
Also, it's one stage I applied for a cadet journalist, but decided against it because

04:15.860 --> 04:18.140
of the rat race, as it really is.

04:20.240 --> 04:24.120
Writing-wise, not much otherwise.

04:24.120 --> 04:30.280
I wouldn't like films and photography and stuff like that.

04:30.580 --> 04:34.320
But some of those things, I don't do it for communication.

04:34.740 --> 04:40.000
That's done for my satisfaction, whereas fanzine is done for feedback.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.020
It's very strange.

04:42.440 --> 04:42.740
Paradox.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.040
There's other satisfaction which doesn't require feedback.

04:46.380 --> 04:50.900
Yeah, well, to answer Lou's question for myself, as Lou knows,

04:51.760 --> 04:54.240
Liam and I are doing some work at the moment outside.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.300
Our side-fanzine is complete.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.020
It's a very strange thing.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.780
Cancer is a very finished thing that we're doing.

05:03.340 --> 05:09.580
But from what we've been doing, and I've been writing some short stories,

05:09.700 --> 05:10.760
which are pretty terrible at the moment.

05:14.180 --> 05:19.300
Yeah, I think there's probably more satisfaction in doing something which I know

05:19.300 --> 05:23.580
could appeal to a larger audience than in doing a fanzine.

05:23.780 --> 05:24.640
Fanzines are easy.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.800
Fanzines are very easy to write.

05:30.160 --> 05:35.740
But to write anything outside that feels this hard.

05:36.020 --> 05:41.340
I personally don't think that I spend much time on the fanzine.

05:41.580 --> 05:44.800
I don't want to try and get a perfect looking thing.

05:48.060 --> 05:51.160
Sometimes I do a second draft.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.160
Sometimes I just whack it up straight there.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.540
I've got my little bottle of Corfu.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.620
I like sniffing it, as Michael Cooney would say.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.860
And that's all there is to it.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.020
I can whack out a stencil in about 12 minutes or something.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.100
Do you think you would get that kind of satisfaction that you get out of fanzines?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.500
I don't know if I get it.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.180
If I get it, I get a satisfaction out of fanzines now.

06:12.180 --> 06:13.160
You're upsetting me.

06:13.820 --> 06:16.120
Well, look, we're going to have to wind this panel up.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.380
So I think we'll just finish with Bruce Gillespie.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.280
Feel right to...

06:20.280 --> 06:26.560
Just making one point about this business of challenge in fanzines.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.920
People contribute to fanzines on several levels,

06:32.060 --> 06:33.880
one of which is just a fun thing.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.940
And they do something without being terribly self-critical about what they do.

06:37.940 --> 06:41.980
Other people use fanzines to cut their literary teeth

06:41.980 --> 06:45.820
to find out the limits of what they can and can't do

06:45.820 --> 06:48.380
to improve their writing and so forth.

06:48.780 --> 06:52.880
As a matter of fact, some of the most popular science fiction authors,

06:53.320 --> 06:57.740
some of our best authors, Ted White, Harlan Ellison, are fans

06:57.740 --> 06:59.780
and cut their literary teeth.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.060
It's all in the business, isn't it?

07:03.060 --> 07:03.320
Yeah.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.740
Some of these people that earn their living by writing,

07:08.880 --> 07:10.080
which is the only real test,

07:10.900 --> 07:15.440
are fans and learn to write within fanzines.

07:15.780 --> 07:17.940
I think the term is worth fans, surely.

07:18.420 --> 07:20.900
No, ah, this is still a fan.

07:21.040 --> 07:21.920
He wouldn't go to conventions.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.380
Are we hiding? You still a fan?

07:24.720 --> 07:25.740
No, I'm not a fan.

07:26.960 --> 07:27.540
What are you?

07:29.360 --> 07:31.240
He's a proper company for his reporting.

07:32.720 --> 07:37.260
Just because you're taking conventions,

07:37.660 --> 07:42.240
I mean, I don't like fanzines, but I...

07:42.800 --> 07:44.860
I don't think there are a lot of things that fans...

07:44.860 --> 07:47.940
I don't consider myself a fan, probably a lexed fan,

07:48.180 --> 07:49.040
you know, like a lexed Catholic,

07:50.080 --> 07:52.480
it still hangs onto you.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.640
They leave charisma there.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.680
What turns you on as meaning the people?

07:57.040 --> 07:58.600
No, is it the people?

07:58.600 --> 08:01.000
No, it's a...

08:01.000 --> 08:03.620
I think once you've read Science Fiction

08:03.620 --> 08:05.480
and been part of fan,

08:05.960 --> 08:07.760
if you've done it at all seriously,

08:08.740 --> 08:11.560
it never fully lets you go.

08:11.700 --> 08:12.260
You can't escape.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.600
Suffer withdrawals from Science Fiction.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.180
I've got to go to the office to cut that literary paper

08:19.000 --> 08:20.700
for Leicester Cones magazine.

08:22.780 --> 08:24.480
Lots of fans cut their paper

08:24.480 --> 08:27.560
in Leicester Cones magazine before they were on the fanzines.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.060
That's true.

08:30.100 --> 08:33.640
In every old, amazing, there was a little bit of fanzine.

08:34.180 --> 08:37.200
Well, look, if David Grigl or Ken Ford won anything else to say,

08:37.300 --> 08:41.000
just before we round off this panel...

08:41.000 --> 08:41.460
I'm struck.

08:41.780 --> 08:46.340
I would say that I don't think fandom is a way of life.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.220
I don't think fandom is a goddamn hobby.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.560
But your boss goes straight to his death.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.560
I think that...

08:53.560 --> 08:57.460
I think with Bill Wright that fandom is a process that we all go through.

08:57.860 --> 08:59.840
You know, I'd go through it.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.620
Some of us don't go through it, though.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.660
But I also like to add my little personal little one.

09:05.820 --> 09:06.960
Fan of the bloody nuisance.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.900
Well, that's a good concluding note.

09:10.300 --> 09:10.640
Yeah, true.

09:15.140 --> 09:16.180
Turn these off, please.

09:16.200 --> 09:16.860
We'll end this.

09:17.340 --> 09:18.580
Let's bring round some cheers.

09:20.340 --> 09:22.060
It's good fun.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.480
I'm a bit of a masterclass.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.500
Make them all clap us, Mr Chairman.

09:26.040 --> 09:26.660
Can I give us a clap?

09:33.780 --> 09:35.480
Of science fiction writers,

09:36.260 --> 09:39.260
if every one's agreeable to that.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.640
In about ten minutes time.

09:45.140 --> 09:47.640
I've been asked to moderate this...

09:48.580 --> 09:49.400
...thrilling panel.

09:50.780 --> 09:52.420
The subject of which I've forgotten.

09:52.620 --> 09:55.140
I think it's something to do with ethnic Aussie SF.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.300
Or words to that nature.

09:58.060 --> 10:03.020
The gentleman on my right is Mr Eric Harris Harris.

10:03.940 --> 10:06.320
A resident of South Australia.

10:07.960 --> 10:14.480
And an author of some note, if you know your vision of tomorrows.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.680
Eric had several stories in the early issues.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.100
He also published a book on astronomy.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.060
I have a faintest idea what his occupation is.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.340
But that doesn't really matter.

10:28.180 --> 10:30.260
This gentleman here is Wynne Whiteford.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.340
And the hobbyist team, John Foester.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.500
Earlyist John Ozzie.

10:35.020 --> 10:35.620
Right.

10:36.460 --> 10:39.420
As regards ethnic Australian SF,

10:40.760 --> 10:45.360
I will now pass you over firstly to John Foester to hear his comments on the subject.

10:47.260 --> 10:51.000
I think it must have been a conventional long time ago.

10:52.420 --> 10:56.480
Well perhaps it was even before we had conventions again that...

10:56.480 --> 11:01.480
...this subject arose certainly not for the first time.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.640
But I think the first time, if I can recall,

11:06.200 --> 11:08.800
and there was a little bit of chat to and fro,

11:09.420 --> 11:11.520
probably involving Lee Harding.

11:12.180 --> 11:14.420
And I think also involving John Baxter.

11:15.420 --> 11:20.620
About the problem of writing uniquely Australian SF.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.760
And Mervyn Barrett.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.220
Who of course is always sensible about these things.

11:29.260 --> 11:32.420
He wrote briefly suggesting that...

11:33.180 --> 11:38.700
...we shouldn't be concentrating on Australian, uniquely Australian SF.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.660
Mervyn always likes to think cosmically.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.200
And so in this particular case he said,

11:46.680 --> 11:48.340
gentlemen let us think globally.

11:48.820 --> 11:52.260
Let us try to write uniquely Terran SF.

11:53.800 --> 11:59.460
Now I think that what Mervyn said is actually quite relevant to what's going on here today.

12:01.780 --> 12:07.700
There are lots and lots of ethnic SF types around.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.220
There's American SF, there's British SF,

12:12.220 --> 12:17.400
there's German SF, there's certainly Polish and Eastern European SF.

12:18.740 --> 12:22.380
And all of these are very, very distinguishable.

12:22.820 --> 12:25.040
Perhaps with a few very notable exceptions.

12:26.320 --> 12:34.960
And to add one other uniquely nationalistic kind of SF doesn't seem to me to add very much to the pool.

12:34.960 --> 12:40.960
And what we do need to do perhaps is to write a science fiction.

12:41.600 --> 12:47.680
Which is suitable for everyone, not just for one country.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.800
Over and out.

12:51.140 --> 12:51.320
Right.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.680
Well, I think we should consider the two types,

12:57.700 --> 13:05.200
or the two distinct types of writing Australian SF.

13:05.480 --> 13:12.040
If it comes to that, there is the form which utilises local background colour.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.100
This is the simplest form.

13:15.160 --> 13:19.680
And this applies really only if you're writing for local markets.

13:19.680 --> 13:27.160
Because you haven't got much chance of selling a science fiction novel on the international market.

13:27.560 --> 13:31.120
That is say based in Australia.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.440
Although Cordway and Smith did it rather successfully.

13:36.100 --> 13:43.820
I'm going to ask Eric now, who has written science fiction for the local market.

13:43.820 --> 13:49.520
And if he could tell me if he's found it effective or not.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.480
Well quite frankly I have not found it effective.

13:54.360 --> 13:58.460
The general tendency seems to be amongst publishers anyway,

13:58.640 --> 14:01.240
that we're not going to take a chance on the local boys.

14:01.980 --> 14:08.400
The reason for this is pretty well understood by everybody that's attempted to write science fiction for a local market.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.800
Or for that matter any form of writing for the local market.

14:11.800 --> 14:16.280
That you have the problem of distribution.

14:16.800 --> 14:22.260
You have the problem of working in your own genre so to speak.

14:23.040 --> 14:29.860
And the problem of distribution more or less rules out any hope of either launching a magazine,

14:30.420 --> 14:34.520
contributing to a magazine specifically for Australian conditions.

14:34.520 --> 14:39.800
Or for that matter of writing for Australian conditions for an overseas market.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.740
Except in a very limited sphere.

14:42.260 --> 14:45.580
Which we attempted to do in the Lake Lamented Vision.

14:47.120 --> 14:52.700
I think there are a very large number of people throughout the world that are interested in the exotic.

14:52.940 --> 14:54.520
And the exotics anywhere where you're not.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.480
And that of course includes Australia.

14:56.760 --> 15:00.500
And there's no doubt about it there isn't an abysmal ignorance of Australia.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.520
And particularly the urban Australia scene.

15:02.660 --> 15:09.160
It'll only be the generally understood comic science fiction side.

15:09.340 --> 15:14.040
If you like of the outback with camels and the didgeridoo's and such like.

15:15.020 --> 15:23.920
But on the whole, no I don't think that we do have any satisfactory outlet for local Australian talent.

15:26.200 --> 15:32.560
I suppose that as I said before that the exotics always where you're not.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.560
And therefore there will be a limited amount.

15:34.940 --> 15:39.760
But as John pointed out a full novel length science fiction.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.260
The general idea is to write it in the neighbourhood of the novella.

15:44.100 --> 15:48.720
And this of course limits you to a certain extent.

15:48.720 --> 15:57.260
To develop a theme fully to understand the Australian background is very unlikely to be done in anything under 8000 words.

15:58.020 --> 16:03.160
And once you do that I'm afraid you'll have to rely upon an international market and not a local market.

16:03.580 --> 16:07.240
I know I've tried very hard particularly in the sphere of children science fiction.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.100
And in this alone you've got to be extremely careful anyway.

16:11.500 --> 16:17.020
And the background here is far too localised.

16:17.020 --> 16:21.420
Our children are urban. They are in fact world urbanites already.

16:22.120 --> 16:29.640
And fast losing whatever Australian characteristics that they would be able to recognise in a children's novel.

16:30.900 --> 16:35.400
I was speaking now in writing for children but the same thing also applies to adult science fiction.

16:37.220 --> 16:46.020
No quite frankly I don't see that the local market is going to be much of an outlet for budding science fiction writers of any style.

16:46.020 --> 16:49.680
The avant-garde or the old stuff.

16:51.660 --> 16:59.760
Well considering the second aspect I know one writer, a very prominent science fiction writer in this country

16:59.760 --> 17:11.540
who to me constantly infuses Australian characteristics into his stories.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.480
This of course is Bert Chandler.

17:15.060 --> 17:25.640
And he operates in the tried and proven way of supposedly writing about the far future

17:27.080 --> 17:30.780
and at the same time writing about the here and now.

17:30.780 --> 17:42.180
His rim world stories as most of you know are really very fanciful variations on his own experience

17:42.880 --> 17:47.900
on the coastal run around Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand.

17:48.500 --> 17:53.120
His characters many of them are just about as strion as you can get.

17:54.600 --> 18:01.940
But because these stories are not localised and recognisably Australian because they are set in the far, far future

18:02.800 --> 18:09.540
Bert is obviously finding a way of writing a form of Australian science fiction.

18:10.060 --> 18:15.280
He has a novel coming from Ren Publishers in Melbourne, a new firm, paperback publisher

18:15.280 --> 18:19.100
which is an expansion of his story The Better Pill which is in vision.

18:19.100 --> 18:28.960
And it is a novel about a futuristic Australia which was not accepted by any publisher overseas

18:28.960 --> 18:37.160
which I think seems to indicate the point that you must write globally for science fiction.

18:38.260 --> 18:44.800
Now when you've been writing stuff many, many years ago when you're overseas in America and in England

18:44.800 --> 18:48.120
did you consciously at any time when you were working for those markets

18:48.780 --> 18:51.080
try to inject Australian elements into your writing?

18:52.520 --> 19:00.320
Well no, frankly no. I think economically you have only one major market that is America

19:00.320 --> 19:04.560
for the simple reason that you've got a population of a couple of hundred millions

19:05.660 --> 19:13.360
and this is about the only one where you can get a magazine with circulation approaching a couple of hundred thousand.

19:15.620 --> 19:23.900
Now this is a part of thinking not only science fiction but other types of magazines that I have contributed to.

19:24.780 --> 19:34.240
I think that what it is possible to do is what Frank Reining did in one story that comes very much to mind

19:34.240 --> 19:42.620
the place of the throwing stick. I don't know if you remember that. I think it appeared in... was it Galaxy?

19:44.560 --> 19:46.760
Fantastic Universe and then a New World in England.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.520
That's right, certainly in one of the American ones first.

19:49.520 --> 19:57.540
Now that, this, some of you may remember, dealt with the Warmer Rocket Range

19:59.480 --> 20:04.600
extrapolated a little bit into the future where a large rocket was going up

20:04.600 --> 20:16.800
and an Aboriginal managed to get down near the launching pad and throw a boomerang into the vines that controlled the direction of the rocket

20:16.800 --> 20:27.600
so that you had the most primitive type of weapon destroying or ranking probably the most advanced type of about the place.

20:27.880 --> 20:33.460
Now that in a sense was a bit of a gimmick story. It was essentially Australian

20:33.460 --> 20:36.300
because it's the only place where you could have that sort of thing happening.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.420
So that's another special case.

20:44.820 --> 20:51.500
Do you think there's any point in exploring the exotic part of Australia for overseas markets?

20:52.000 --> 20:59.540
I mean like having a spaceport in the centre of Australia, do you think overseas that this is what it would accept?

20:59.800 --> 21:02.640
This is a reasonable extrapolation and marketing gimmick?

21:02.980 --> 21:08.980
Just possible, but I think that frankly I think it strange the credibility gap a bit far.

21:09.940 --> 21:19.900
I think you'd, again, to have the heavier spaceports where in countries where most of the space development is taking place.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.020
I don't think it would include Warmer there.

21:24.420 --> 21:28.220
I think the Australian locale in this case is a once only job.

21:28.580 --> 21:28.740
Yes.

21:28.860 --> 21:32.500
You might get away with it once and it's about all. And if you've done it well nobody else can do it.

21:32.560 --> 21:32.840
That's right.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.180
Yes, nobody else can introduce a Warmering letter.

21:37.840 --> 21:49.380
John, do you think there's a quality about any Australian science fiction writing which does set it apart from the American or British equivalent?

21:51.680 --> 21:57.860
Well, it seems to me that there's scarcely enough Australian science fiction to do this.

21:58.820 --> 22:13.280
And if you were to try and summarize it, I think it's really a matter of saying that most Australian writers have their work published in British magazines.

22:14.280 --> 22:26.580
And consequently the sort of fiction that seems to represent Australian science fiction is the sort of stuff that appeals to British editors.

22:28.100 --> 22:36.000
Now, it may appeal to British editors either because they like to see the colonials making good,

22:37.460 --> 22:43.360
or it may appeal to the British editors because it didn't appeal to the American editors who pay a lot more.

22:45.060 --> 22:52.440
Now, if it's the case that it didn't appeal to the American editors, then of course one could assume that,

22:54.120 --> 23:02.220
or one could assume in the days when there were a lot more American editors that perhaps the stories were so attention grabbing.

23:04.140 --> 23:10.840
Nowadays, when there are fewer editors and the prejudices might be very difficult to get around,

23:11.820 --> 23:17.940
it may be a different matter, but of course then there are no British magazines nowadays, apart from New World.

23:19.060 --> 23:29.000
I think it's fair enough to say that in the past, most Australian science fiction has been written by people who don't make the full time thing of it

23:29.000 --> 23:32.280
with the way even some of the British writers have done.

23:33.280 --> 23:39.060
Bert Chandler is about the nearest and of course he does quite well without the science fiction.

23:46.480 --> 23:54.660
Because I think the ideal thing is to sell a story in America first and then later in Britain, sometimes you can bring that off,

23:54.660 --> 24:01.040
but you get about five times as much of it in the States as John has pointed out.

24:02.580 --> 24:11.540
But one thing that I think, Garmin, is that it is a field where editor contact is pretty important.

24:12.600 --> 24:20.300
If you can actually rough a story out and then contact the editor either by phone or else take the thing along to him

24:20.300 --> 24:22.280
just in a rough day up full and talk it over with him.

24:23.300 --> 24:26.640
And then sure, the sale, now you can't do this from a distance.

24:28.620 --> 24:35.680
Now I found that I was having to operate this way in America, to some extent, and then later when I went to England,

24:36.820 --> 24:42.180
I found that I sold mostly to Carnell because I could go along and actually talk to him or ring him up.

24:43.300 --> 24:53.060
Now this seems a tremendous amount of possible lost time in duplicating a story that may have been put in by somebody else.

24:53.820 --> 24:56.960
Well perhaps one that you've never heard of but the editor may know.

24:58.580 --> 25:05.080
I think it's fairly important to be absolutely sure that you're selling the thing before you start to reveal that thing.

25:07.380 --> 25:12.080
I've got one little point about that and this is very important for everybody to pay very great attention

25:12.080 --> 25:15.380
to. I once wrote a very short story called The Superdense Man.

25:16.020 --> 25:23.400
I thought it was extremely good. I sent it to America and they told me, yes, this is a little bit too, it needs pruning.

25:23.660 --> 25:28.680
You're obviously a young author and this needs pruning. I wasn't young, I'm in my 50s, but it said it needs pruning.

25:28.940 --> 25:33.700
So it got sent back, at least the rejection slip had a pen and ink sign on the editor on it.

25:34.040 --> 25:39.620
I sent it to Michael Moorcock before New World took its first plunge and he said, very good Eric,

25:39.620 --> 25:46.600
but it's a little bit too broad approach. It needs a secondary theme. It needs to be a little bit larger.

25:47.160 --> 25:55.160
I sent it to the ABC, exactly the length that it was. And it was very important. It's the same story and it wasn't touched.

25:55.840 --> 26:03.360
Yes Ron, I always make a practice of giving it a far more copy than he needs so that he can cut a bit out to please himself

26:03.360 --> 26:06.900
and he still doesn't really have a story.

26:07.580 --> 26:14.120
But now, there's been a lot of talk about loyalty in Australian professional magazine again and all that sort of thing.

26:14.320 --> 26:25.140
Well, I'm really sure if I was the editor of such a magazine I would not consider trying to get it off the ground

26:25.140 --> 26:30.680
using stories by local writers, using an Australian low car.

26:30.680 --> 26:36.120
Every second or third issue I might like to do this, put in a story like that.

26:36.500 --> 26:45.340
But I can't see a magazine using the work of Australian writers who wrote solely about Australian problems,

26:45.500 --> 26:49.620
Australian futures and Australian environment. It wouldn't be exotic enough.

26:53.440 --> 26:57.320
John, what do you think are the hopes for an Australian magazine?

26:59.020 --> 27:07.120
Well, you ask me this at each successive conventionally. It's quite obvious you're not satisfied with the answer.

27:07.440 --> 27:15.240
Get more doom laden. But on that particular facet of it, we would need stories from overseas writers as well, wouldn't we?

27:20.300 --> 27:24.500
Frankly, I've said this at the other conventions, so you know already.

27:24.980 --> 27:32.060
You can't make a go of it in Australia in the Orthodox way. You can't do it with a newsstand magazine.

27:33.060 --> 27:37.200
Now, if anything should convince people of that, it's what happened with rats.

27:38.620 --> 27:45.080
Rats, I don't think, has got many claims with all due respect to the editors.

27:45.620 --> 27:53.260
And the many authors whose work has appeared in there who are in this hall today, myself except the professor.

27:54.800 --> 27:59.360
I don't think the rats had a terribly perfect... that had my villain with pessimistic.

27:59.360 --> 28:07.580
Has a very professional attitude towards either the writers or the readers for that matter.

28:07.660 --> 28:11.820
Certainly it's improved as time's gone by. They proved it could be done.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.080
They proved it could be done if you were willing to lose that many hundred dollars a month it could be done.

28:18.080 --> 28:28.020
And frankly, I think that rats showed that something which had rather broader appeal than a science fiction magazine still couldn't succeed.

28:30.060 --> 28:38.600
Consequently, if you're trying to sell something in a science fiction line, you'd probably have to give it a title like,

28:39.140 --> 28:43.960
very small, that is science fiction, then about two inch letters, four of it.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.000
And a science fiction forum.

28:46.500 --> 28:53.620
Perhaps people might just confuse it with another magazine and you get your money that way.

28:54.420 --> 29:01.720
I really feel that at a time when England can't support a science fiction magazine,

29:02.300 --> 29:06.520
talk about Australia doing it is really getting way out.

29:06.740 --> 29:12.880
If you consider just the sales that amazing and fantastic have in the States.

29:14.480 --> 29:22.400
And the fact that in Australia magazine would have additional problems of distribution over and above those,

29:22.560 --> 29:24.820
which amazing and fantastic fact.

29:25.480 --> 29:31.280
I think it's quite obvious that an orthodox approach to a science fiction magazine in Australia just wouldn't succeed.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.100
I don't think that an orthodox one would succeed either.

29:36.260 --> 29:44.620
But it might have a better chance and that would be to try to do it in the form of a little literary magazine,

29:45.700 --> 29:47.180
except that you pay the authors.

29:49.160 --> 29:57.620
And this, that's a possibility provided you're willing to put a $1.50 or $2 price tag on it.

29:57.620 --> 30:06.660
And since Vertex has done just that, put the price on it, and it's published some pretty dreadful material,

30:06.880 --> 30:09.060
but I don't think it'll survive.

30:09.600 --> 30:16.440
But if Vertex does survive, then it suggests that there's possibly a market for a high priced magazine,

30:16.980 --> 30:25.020
in which case Australia might succeed, provided that you're willing to sell about 150 copies in Australia and the rest in America.

30:27.620 --> 30:36.960
Merrick, have you had any experience submitting to the local fiction type magazines like the KG Murray chain or any of those people?

30:37.520 --> 30:39.260
What sort of response have you had from them?

30:39.780 --> 30:47.460
Very generous and on the whole, where they criticise, quite constructive and useful criticism, also a couple of sales.

30:50.300 --> 30:59.200
On the whole, I think that the KG Murray and that type of magazine is a very good outlet for anybody attempting to break into a market.

30:59.300 --> 31:06.740
In fact, it's one of the easiest ways, I would say, as far as local publishers are concerned for anything of book length,

31:07.100 --> 31:09.620
so I'd say you've got a different story.

31:10.480 --> 31:15.800
Harking back to John's discussion of the possibility of an Australian magazine,

31:16.480 --> 31:26.720
I really do feel that a shot in the arm, such as has been given by the literary grants recently by this present government,

31:27.380 --> 31:34.060
might have some sort of formal approach to get some form of subsidy for this sort of thing.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.300
Quite obviously any art form these days requires heavy subsidy, I think.

31:37.300 --> 31:44.200
The fact that the Lolli Shops and the big stores are absolutely chock-a-block full of science fiction

31:44.200 --> 31:51.760
and most of it rehash from way back seems to suggest to me that there's an eager public waiting to read this stuff.

31:52.560 --> 32:02.320
And as they are doing so, the problems are mainly distribution and or virtually taking a financial chance.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.620
Now, quite obviously we can't do this, as you say, any magazine as you do like this,

32:05.680 --> 32:08.660
is bound to fly for a few months and then hit the deck.

32:09.240 --> 32:17.080
But with a government subsidy, and this I think requires some careful thought on the part of people that are not only writers,

32:17.280 --> 32:27.440
but aspiring writers, to lobby or to, in some, if you like, a quasi-official sense,

32:27.440 --> 32:33.620
say this convention or any convention for that matter, to make some approach to some official in this respect,

32:33.760 --> 32:39.760
to say, well, is it possible to have a literary shot in there, somewhat similar to the Council of Arts,

32:40.160 --> 32:43.340
the job that was done for New Worlds in England?

32:44.980 --> 32:47.580
What do you think is possible, is it that John? Do you think it's...

32:49.060 --> 32:56.760
Well, after handing out one and a half million, they're probably willing to throw a few hundred in the direction of science fiction.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.940
But then Bert Chandler, as I said, doesn't need it.

33:03.500 --> 33:11.200
The approach that's being used by the federal government is, I think, to support ventures which have been started.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.520
And this seems to me to make some sort of business sense.

33:17.720 --> 33:23.760
How do the rest of you feel about the rather sharp division here between science fiction and other material?

33:24.260 --> 33:28.000
Do you think a blurring of that line of demarcation might help?

33:29.020 --> 33:32.140
I think if you found that sort of thing in some of Koji Murray's publications,

33:32.340 --> 33:37.540
how men has been running things that you can only call science fiction stories for quite a long while.

33:38.460 --> 33:42.100
I think the Tenth and Mortal is one I remember missing about ten years ago.

33:42.520 --> 33:48.700
Oh, they do, do it steadily. They've even published Jack Waddon's.

33:48.700 --> 33:49.020
That's right.

33:49.020 --> 34:00.580
Waddon, when David Brodick was editing, the whole business of Australian science fiction and how it actually works out,

34:00.620 --> 34:05.800
I think is best demonstrated by a little chore I had several months ago.

34:05.920 --> 34:06.420
Wake up, Robin.

34:08.360 --> 34:16.680
I was engaged for a couple of months working on a projected multimedia spectacle,

34:16.680 --> 34:19.620
as it was called at one stage, with a theatre in Melbourne.

34:20.260 --> 34:25.760
Now, initially, two writers were engaged to work up a synopsis,

34:26.440 --> 34:30.680
sort of utilising all these elements, live actors, music and screens.

34:31.700 --> 34:35.900
And I submitted a synopsis and the other writer submitted a synopsis

34:35.900 --> 34:41.900
and we had a meeting at the table one night and the synopsis passed around and we also commented on it.

34:41.900 --> 34:50.340
And the other writers' synopsis included among its plot gimmicks,

34:50.620 --> 35:00.900
Ares Rock, an aboriginal dance, various, or a magician, a medieval magician,

35:01.600 --> 35:04.240
but I don't think the Opera House came into it.

35:04.600 --> 35:09.780
But we had much talk and to do about this and in half an hour,

35:09.780 --> 35:16.360
we decided that although the arts, people in charge of artistic grants,

35:16.420 --> 35:22.680
would be terribly pleased to see so much Australia scattered through the production,

35:23.060 --> 35:29.160
that when you have an opportunity like this, it's best to go the whole hog and do something

35:29.160 --> 35:35.480
which has meaning for everybody rather than which will just appeal to a minority.

35:36.260 --> 35:40.500
And so all those ideas were tossed out and we immediately went to work on

35:40.500 --> 35:44.880
something with much broader scope which would be completely Australian

35:44.880 --> 35:53.120
in the people working on the production and we were confident that this was sufficient,

35:53.680 --> 36:01.980
that why limit yourself to just one small thing when you can reach a whole audience?

36:01.980 --> 36:05.520
And I think this is something science fiction does and has to do,

36:05.620 --> 36:10.800
that it has the ability to reach past national barriers and someone in Russia

36:10.800 --> 36:14.940
or South Africa can read a story written by somebody in America

36:14.940 --> 36:19.800
and the national characteristics don't contribute all that much to a success.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.820
Are there any questions from the audience?

36:23.080 --> 36:23.500
Yes sir.

36:24.280 --> 36:28.720
One aspect that worries me about this is the colonial question about should there be

36:28.720 --> 36:31.680
something Australian in the future and there's all concepts,

36:31.800 --> 36:48.740
it seems to me that the concept of insisting that science fiction be a part of

36:48.740 --> 36:52.980
Australia's and Australian countries and so on is that another critical matter

36:52.980 --> 36:54.520
to stay from the sort of nature of this?

36:54.660 --> 36:54.940
Yes.

36:55.140 --> 37:00.400
It's one thing that's good enough for us to go on to try to have magazines and so forth

37:00.400 --> 37:05.540
that use Australian authors because it may well be that Australian authors are restricted

37:05.540 --> 37:09.160
from the opportunities that other authors may have elsewhere in the world

37:09.160 --> 37:13.140
and it's so worth what providing for them but it's quite a different matter

37:13.140 --> 37:15.360
to do so with the sort of paper on the emphasis.

37:15.360 --> 37:19.280
I think what Bert Chandler has done is very good.

37:19.380 --> 37:22.800
I don't think Bert is doing it out of patriotic way but that's because it's so convenient.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.120
How do you do it quite well?

37:24.720 --> 37:31.140
Well I think in all high expectations what Wyn was saying that the two distinct forms

37:31.140 --> 37:35.780
that we're familiar with, American science fiction and British science fiction,

37:37.520 --> 37:42.280
were created by markets, not by individual writers or any patriotism.

37:42.280 --> 37:49.720
It was the editors who helped to form the particular literary climate

37:50.280 --> 37:56.780
and until we have a consistent publishing field here,

37:57.320 --> 38:01.340
we will continue to ape overseas styles.

38:01.980 --> 38:05.420
But if we had a really dynamic, John W. Campbell working in Australia,

38:05.940 --> 38:09.180
he would help to create a form of science fiction,

38:09.180 --> 38:14.340
I'm sure it would be easily recognisable as different to the overseas.

38:14.580 --> 38:14.800
Yes Bill?

38:14.880 --> 38:18.300
Could I bring up a point on that just before we hit that?

38:18.400 --> 38:19.000
Why don't we touch that?

38:20.420 --> 38:25.760
On this point about the two different types of science fiction developing in America and in England,

38:26.480 --> 38:29.500
I think the American one was governed largely by people like Campbell

38:30.460 --> 38:36.620
and the other editors at Femin, the other editors of the major papers there, Poucher.

38:38.180 --> 38:46.000
In England I think it was set mainly by that little scoring list that used to appear in New Worlds.

38:46.760 --> 38:52.740
You know where each story was rated first, second, third, fourth, fifth for the stories for the previous issue.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.420
Can't it have made them up you know?

38:56.680 --> 38:58.300
Well no, he took a bit of notice on that.

39:00.260 --> 39:02.120
I know he might have had to build them up a bit.

39:02.360 --> 39:03.200
I think he had to.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.740
I think he did get some replies.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.940
He used to write and tell me the actual percentage of readers who actually wrote letters into that thing.

39:10.940 --> 39:15.080
Yeah there wasn't many but I think he did have a sort of a proper feedback there.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.180
I think he did.

39:16.180 --> 39:16.900
I think he did on top of John Brunner.

39:16.980 --> 39:17.880
Oh that doesn't seem true.

39:19.220 --> 39:20.780
I think he did actually.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.240
It's not one of those, anyway.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.360
He took them seriously.

39:24.620 --> 39:26.040
Well I wouldn't say that.

39:26.180 --> 39:27.160
I wouldn't exaggerate myself.

39:27.460 --> 39:32.000
Well the stories I always liked, we always wound up down the bottom of those things you know that's it.

39:32.000 --> 39:32.820
I don't know if you like the story.

39:32.860 --> 39:34.100
Ryan Aldis Ballard and all of that.

39:34.460 --> 39:35.640
Bill what were you going to say?

39:36.260 --> 39:44.440
The point that I had to make was that we had a very little distinctive culture of our own.

39:44.720 --> 39:49.680
We're virtually an ex-clay of the European American culture.

39:51.160 --> 39:56.400
And that if we're going to produce anything distinctively Australian,

39:56.400 --> 39:59.660
sort of degenerate things that are a bit huge,

39:59.800 --> 40:00.680
that we're used to.

40:01.480 --> 40:05.300
Yes but Bill, this is purely the background.

40:06.120 --> 40:14.280
I do maintain that there are things with the national character which are valid and which will come out in a story of right,

40:14.360 --> 40:19.540
whether it's said 200 years in the future, it will come out but not until there's a market to develop it.

40:20.580 --> 40:28.140
The people in the megalopolis of Toronto are very much the same sort of people there are in the megalopolis of Melbourne.

40:29.380 --> 40:31.140
You say that Bill, can I hear it again?

40:32.880 --> 40:34.520
I've written it many times but I'm not sure.

40:34.540 --> 40:39.600
I've written it in the Megalopolis of London before you guys came out to the hysterics.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.620
I'd like to answer you on one of those points.

40:42.780 --> 40:45.620
I was many years ago in the megalopolis of London

40:45.620 --> 40:49.640
and at that particular time they were doing a serial called Journey into Space

40:49.640 --> 40:54.640
and it had a jazzy position between Mars and Australia.

40:54.980 --> 40:57.940
They were a very clever and interesting one too.

40:58.720 --> 41:04.380
And one of the characters in there, Mitch, was, I've never, Australia is just cardboard characters as far as I'm concerned,

41:04.840 --> 41:09.900
but I remember being completely thrilled by this Australian background.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.880
I don't know whether an Australian author wrote this particular thing,

41:12.880 --> 41:16.080
but nevertheless there's no argument about it.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.560
You do write best about that which you know.

41:19.340 --> 41:23.420
And if you know the Australian locale you can write far more convincingly than you would say in America.

41:24.080 --> 41:24.220
Good.

41:24.760 --> 41:26.760
I'm going to wind this up in a moment.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.000
We've got time for one more question.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.060
Here's Ken.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.120
We've got that already, Ken.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.380
Yeah, that's what I reckon.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.660
Any dissension on that point?

41:58.680 --> 42:00.640
No, I consider Jack Wattons an Australian.

42:01.260 --> 42:01.860
Yes, I do.

42:03.000 --> 42:10.960
Okay, well thank you John, Wyn, Eric and thank you Lee for vacating this so the next program item can go on as scheduled.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.440
Thank you for your attention.

42:18.520 --> 42:25.500
Here's a lecturer at Linda's University and she's going to be speaking on Children's Fantasy.

42:33.500 --> 42:38.360
I asked but it should be said that I don't know very much about science fiction before I started.

42:39.200 --> 42:40.620
And so I'm saying it.

42:41.980 --> 42:48.320
I read science fiction a bit but I couldn't profess to be expert about it in any way at all.

42:50.620 --> 42:59.380
But it occurred to me that readers of science fiction might be aware that they have some things in common with readers of fantasy,

43:00.820 --> 43:06.520
but that they might be less aware that they have the same things in common with readers of children's books.

43:08.360 --> 43:14.660
The title of a collection of essays that arose out of the MLA's forum on science fiction,

43:15.020 --> 43:20.940
which was edited by Thomas Clairison in 71, is I think interesting in this respect.

43:21.400 --> 43:24.260
It's called SF, The Other Side of Realism.

43:26.300 --> 43:30.960
And the title of a more recently published collection of essays on children's literature,

43:31.820 --> 43:40.100
also arising out of an MLA seminar, The Seminar on Children's Literature, was The Great Excluded.

43:41.740 --> 43:51.000
Now the definite article used in both of those titles indicates, I think, a degree of unawareness of each other among the two groups.

43:52.480 --> 43:59.200
It seems to me that we may be involved in the same difficulties and engaged in the same struggle

43:59.200 --> 44:03.180
without benefiting from mutual support and encouragement.

44:05.060 --> 44:12.520
So I'm here today not as an expert on science fiction, which I couldn't claim to be but to express,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.440
and I hope illicit, feelings of solidarity.

44:18.280 --> 44:27.400
The introductory essay in that Clairison collection begins with the point made by Fred Poll at the MLA SF forum in 68.

44:28.380 --> 44:34.500
The point that, and I quote, it didn't matter what had been written in the field of science fiction.

44:34.820 --> 44:41.700
The real difficulty in obtaining a critical hearing, particularly among librarians and academics at all levels,

44:42.400 --> 44:49.940
lay in that from 1926, when Hugo Gernsback founded Amazing Stories, the first pulp devoted exclusively to the genre,

44:49.940 --> 44:57.940
until the 1940s at least, SF had lived amid garish covers and poor prints and rough edges,

44:58.580 --> 45:04.880
so that you usually carry them home under your coat because you didn't want anyone to know what you were reading.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.220
That situation is quite familiar to me and to students in my children's literature course.

45:12.540 --> 45:15.640
They tend to carry their books around under their coat too.

45:16.620 --> 45:21.320
But the important phrase is the real difficulty in obtaining a critical hearing.

45:22.680 --> 45:31.520
And it arose, I think, out of being identified in the critical mind with popular rather than with serious literature.

45:32.560 --> 45:35.860
And this is a difficulty which children's literature also faces,

45:36.840 --> 45:42.000
although it has the support of some librarians who are known as children's librarians,

45:42.800 --> 45:47.660
and some academics like myself who are known as our expert on kiddie lit.

45:49.940 --> 45:53.840
It's not discussed in histories of 20th century literature,

45:54.100 --> 46:03.660
nor do works of children's literature any more commonly than science fiction books turn up on academic English courses devoted to the modern novel.

46:05.960 --> 46:10.620
The other similarity between the position of science fiction and the position of children's literature

46:10.620 --> 46:16.540
is indicated by that title of the Clairson collection of essays, The Other Side of Realism.

46:18.440 --> 46:27.600
In fact, although like SF, children's books, especially written for children, can be traced back earlier to the early 18th century.

46:27.800 --> 46:31.980
In fact, Golliver's travels is a very interesting text for the history of both our genres.

46:32.680 --> 46:40.040
The concept of children's literature dates from exactly the same period, that is the 1870s and 1880s,

46:40.780 --> 46:43.060
as does the concept of science fiction.

46:43.660 --> 46:52.960
And it was affected in exactly the same way by the acceptance of realism as a criterion for seriousness in the novel.

46:53.560 --> 46:59.400
In fact, I was very, very struck when I read this in Clairson's own essay in this collection.

47:01.140 --> 47:09.220
This paragraph, he points out that the realist doctrine, we might call it,

47:09.420 --> 47:16.670
was in fact based at least in the way that Zola argued for it on some analogy with scientific procedure,

47:17.540 --> 47:22.160
so that the modern realist novel could have been called science fiction, but it wasn't.

47:22.800 --> 47:32.200
Instead, he said, that name has been given to a kind of fantasy which took shape as a diverse, recognisable genre during the same period,

47:32.340 --> 47:37.000
which saw the rise of literary realism 1870 to 1910.

47:37.820 --> 47:42.460
It made use of such established conventions as the imaginary voyage and the utopia,

47:42.960 --> 47:47.260
and had seen earlier expression in the works of such authors as Mary Shelley and Poe,

47:47.260 --> 47:55.240
but it didn't coalesce into a distinctly separate modern fantasy until the last decades of the 19th century.

47:56.240 --> 47:59.400
The parallel with children's literature is very, very exact.

47:59.680 --> 48:07.740
In fact, I opened the very first lecture I ever gave at Fender's on children's literature by pointing to just that period as a period of crisis.

48:09.660 --> 48:17.520
It certainly was decisive in the development of 20th century prose fiction and attitudes towards it.

48:18.860 --> 48:27.120
In England, the advocate of that new wave fashion as it then was of realism was Henry James,

48:27.740 --> 48:36.620
and from the point of view of children's literature, the opposition between Henry James and Robert Louis Stevenson is most instructive.

48:36.620 --> 48:44.620
From the point of view of science fiction, I suppose it's the opposition between James and H.G. Wells, which is illuminating.

48:46.960 --> 48:56.440
Now at the time that realism was adopted from France into English criticism, it seemed to mean two disparate things.

48:57.380 --> 49:02.600
First, that the artist should aim for very similitude in presentation.

49:02.600 --> 49:13.280
And secondly, that novels should include previously prohibited material, which at that time largely referred to sex and the working class.

49:14.980 --> 49:27.860
Now, as far as the requirement for various similitudes concerned, it's only really checkable, if you think about it, in novels about contemporary life.

49:29.100 --> 49:38.760
Novels set in the past, in the future, or in some completely imaginary world, are simply not checkable for their very similitude.

49:39.760 --> 49:44.220
And Henry James demanded that novels be checkable in this way.

49:44.780 --> 49:52.180
He liked, he said, to be able to say yes or no at any stage of reading a novel.

49:52.180 --> 50:05.700
And he suggested that this is how novels should be read, dispassionately, objectively, with the reader keeping a sufficient distance from the book to be able to judge its truth.

50:06.680 --> 50:11.580
In other words, I presume its truth to life in what was being presented.

50:13.860 --> 50:18.840
Now you can see how this rules out fantasy, which is not about real life by definition.

50:19.520 --> 50:27.020
And you can see also how it rules out the historical novel, which might have been checkable once, but no longer is.

50:27.920 --> 50:33.220
And an SF book, which is set in the future, is in a very odd position in this argument.

50:34.380 --> 50:41.280
It perhaps can be seen in retrospect to have been a very good book, or it can become a very good book.

50:41.800 --> 50:46.920
But it can't be a good book, or be known to be a good book at the time of publication.

50:48.840 --> 50:56.640
Well that's an absurd situation, since the book hasn't changed, nor has the literary value by which it's being measured, that of being true to life.

50:57.260 --> 51:01.540
So if the book hasn't changed and the values haven't changed, how can it get better?

51:02.120 --> 51:04.920
Or qualify in any other way for being called good?

51:06.640 --> 51:13.480
And I think that the tendency to make the value of SF dependent on the accuracy of its predictions

51:13.480 --> 51:22.240
was a somewhat indefensible critical attitude which was brought about by pressure from that criterion of being true to life.

51:22.680 --> 51:29.740
Which was an effect again of the rise to dominance of realism as the definition of a serious novel.

51:30.760 --> 51:33.100
A novel that could be considered as a work of art.

51:35.080 --> 51:42.960
The criticism of children's literature has been forced into some equally absurd postures you'll be glad to know, by this pressure from realism.

51:43.480 --> 51:51.940
If you read books about children's literature and turn to the chapter on fantasy, you'll almost invariably find the critic expending a great deal of energy,

51:52.300 --> 51:58.280
explaining how it is that fantasy is good for children, though not good for adults.

51:59.100 --> 52:09.340
They will tell you that children like fantasy and adults don't, and probably explain this with some reference to the recapitulation theory of human development.

52:09.340 --> 52:19.300
That is the theory sometimes called the culture epoch theory where each individual recapitulates the development of the species as a whole.

52:20.040 --> 52:23.220
Thus, according to this theory, children are like primitives.

52:23.740 --> 52:34.800
They're ignorant and curious about the world and seek explanations in fantasy because they cannot differentiate between a plausible and an implausible explanation.

52:36.220 --> 52:45.540
And you'll notice in passing that this assumes that children like fantasy because they believe it's true, whereas adults dislike it because they know it's not.

52:47.980 --> 52:51.460
There's a great deal of interesting discussion hinging on that too.

52:52.420 --> 53:01.380
For the moment, all I wish to point out is that critics of children's literature have come up with elaborate explanations for what may not be the case at all,

53:01.380 --> 53:13.480
namely that children like fantasy and adults don't, largely because they've been unwilling to face the fact that fantasy had been merely abandoned by influential writers and critics

53:13.480 --> 53:19.660
when they adopted the somewhat narrow version of realism which flourished in the first half of this century.

53:20.620 --> 53:28.300
And this seems to me to be exactly comparable to the reaction of SF critics who were willing to have the excellence of SF as literature,

53:28.300 --> 53:38.340
depend on the accuracy of its predictions, so that it could be seen, at least in retrospectives, having been true to life, or being true to life.

53:40.300 --> 53:46.520
Now, the second aspect of realism that I mentioned was the inclusion of previously prohibited material.

53:48.800 --> 53:56.520
Now, that was advocated by Henry James in an essay that he published on the brink of this century in 1899 called The Future of the Novel.

53:57.500 --> 54:03.580
And he complained about the absence of sex, which by the way he called, quote,

54:03.920 --> 54:09.940
the great relation between men and women, the constant world renewal, in the English novel.

54:10.740 --> 54:20.540
The reason he advanced was that the English novel had been handicapped by its family readership, by what he called the presence of the ladies and the children,

54:20.540 --> 54:26.100
by whom he said, in other words, I mean the reader, irreflective and uncritical.

54:28.460 --> 54:35.640
The Future of the Novel, which he also called, in other words, the great prose fable,

54:36.140 --> 54:42.320
rested, according to James, on what it decided to do with respect to the young.

54:43.260 --> 54:46.740
He declared, in fact, by what it decides to do with respect to the young,

54:46.740 --> 54:53.440
the great prose fable will, from any serious point of view, practically see itself stand or fall.

54:54.660 --> 55:01.720
And in fact, what James was recommending was that the children be sent away to play with their mothers, of course,

55:02.260 --> 55:05.720
so that the serious novelist could be free to talk about sex.

55:07.740 --> 55:13.640
And since he classed all but novels about contemporary life, non-serious or romances,

55:13.640 --> 55:18.640
that included Jules Verne and H.G. Wells as well as Robert Louis Stevenson.

55:19.980 --> 55:24.740
This exclusion has done incalculable harm to children's reading.

55:25.660 --> 55:31.760
Books were divided then into serious literature for adults, one might almost say adult males only,

55:32.540 --> 55:41.300
and the rest, and the rest, seeing themselves as popular literature, defined themselves thus in negatives.

55:43.640 --> 55:47.440
Now, since James made so much of his case rest on the young,

55:48.040 --> 55:52.780
it's not surprising that the effect was most noticeable in the area of children's literature.

55:53.660 --> 55:59.880
Since serious novels were defined as dealing with sex, children's literature was defined as not dealing with sex,

56:00.480 --> 56:05.360
which has been kept out of children's books successfully for most of the last 70 years.

56:05.960 --> 56:12.760
And the fuss you might have noticed in the press recently about what's called the new realism in children's books

56:13.640 --> 56:21.760
has been, in fact, an attempt to reintroduce topics such as sex, politics, satire and so on into children's books,

56:22.120 --> 56:26.800
and thus catch up 70 years later with serious adult fiction.

56:28.280 --> 56:31.680
Now, one expects that reaction in children's literature,

56:32.240 --> 56:39.040
but it's surprising that I've found that something very similar seemed to happen in science fiction.

56:39.920 --> 56:45.520
Until the last few years, I understand sex has been strikingly absent from science fiction,

56:45.860 --> 56:50.320
and there too has fairly recently, that isn't the last decade, made a comeback.

56:50.980 --> 56:55.160
Someone might be able to put me right on that point, but it's what I've gathered from my recent reading.

56:56.000 --> 57:02.260
I think it's an indication of the pervasiveness of that elitist critical doctrine of James's,

57:02.260 --> 57:11.360
that it so successfully preempted the topic of sex from all other modes of serious writing, except the so-called realistic.

57:14.300 --> 57:22.600
Well, having sketched some ways in which I believe that the rise of realism had a similar impact on the genre of children's literature,

57:23.020 --> 57:25.200
and on the one hand, and science fiction on the other,

57:26.440 --> 57:30.260
I'd now like to turn to some of the effects of that joint exclusion.

57:31.080 --> 57:35.100
And it seems to me that they are by and large, though not wholly bad,

57:36.060 --> 57:43.700
and that for that reason, it is proper to try to achieve serious critical consideration for our respective genre,

57:44.020 --> 57:51.580
rather than to give away the whole business of literary criticism, and especially academic literary criticism, as a bad elitist job.

57:53.520 --> 58:01.580
Now, the worst effect, I think, of being identified as popular, rather than as serious, seems to me to be conservatism.

58:04.000 --> 58:12.540
John would get defined by publishers, bookshops, and exchanges, by an estimation which they make of a book's market.

58:13.900 --> 58:19.260
If you go into a book exchange looking for Dune, you go to the science fiction section.

58:19.260 --> 58:26.860
But where do you find war and peace? In the war book section? And crime and punishment in the murder mystery section?

58:28.480 --> 58:35.260
Now, all the sections say science fiction, war, murder, romance, historical, children, and so on.

58:36.080 --> 58:42.460
And the market for each is predicted by the publisher, and a book which has no predictable market,

58:42.460 --> 58:50.460
and yet is clearly not serious literature, on which you might be prepared to take a risk for prestige reasons,

58:50.860 --> 58:58.300
for instance, that it's fantasy, but it seems to be written towards adults or something, will have great difficulty in getting published at all.

58:59.400 --> 59:05.260
You see, Mr Swift, all books about little people go into the children's section, and children are just not interested in politics,

59:05.260 --> 59:10.480
so I'm afraid, Mr Swift, that although we thought your travel book was just fascinating, we have to turn it down.

59:14.060 --> 59:22.320
So, stereotypes of an audience get built up by people who are obviously not willing to risk money backing an experiment

59:22.320 --> 59:27.540
in something that's meant to be popular, whoever heard of an unpopular, popular novel.

59:28.520 --> 59:30.760
And so, second-hand shots, I suppose.

59:32.900 --> 59:37.660
And in fact, these stereotypes limit what reaches the audience,

59:37.660 --> 59:44.220
and in turn make the audience more limited in its tastes, and so become self-fulfilling.

59:45.760 --> 59:51.280
And all this operates against the emergence of outstanding or revolutionary writers,

59:51.520 --> 59:56.300
and this operates against development, change, and advances in the genre.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:04.340
So, being identified as popular rather than serious literature can have the effect of making a genre as a whole,

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:09.260
conservative and discouraging of experiment, which I think is a bad thing.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.500
Another effect is to encourage the idea that popularity is an index of merit.

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:26.560
And I think this might, if I understand your program correctly, be reflected in your procedure for awarding your Dittmar awards on the basis of a majority vote.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:36.180
Now, you might argue that anyone interested in coming to the conference must be an expert in the sense of having read a fair amount of science fiction.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:44.140
But I suggest to you that that isn't a criteria used elsewhere for selecting people whose judgment you can trust.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.240
Criticism is, I think, a very practical business.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:56.540
We read the critics or reviewers whose judgment we've learned to trust in the expectation that they'll help us enjoy books.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:11.900
We select those critics on the basis of experience, that is, the critics who produced more recommendations which turned out to be fulfilled in our experience of the book subsequently.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.800
And we discriminate between critics and reviewers constantly on those grounds.

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:22.880
And the grounds that the critics offer to us are not those of popularity.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:29.560
I don't think we'd be much influenced by a reviewer who says, read this because a million other people have read it.

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:38.560
No matter how many copies are, for instance, an Agatha Christie novel is sold, we won't believe that it's a better novel than crime and punishment on those grounds.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:49.700
Now, in the field of children's books, all sorts of peculiar arguments are constructed to explain why popularity should be taken into account.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:02:01.960
It's suggested, for instance, that since children's tastes are absolutely different from adults' tastes, there's no way of finding out what's best for them other than by observing their own preferences.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:11.500
Thus, there was some official critical justification at hand for those who protested against the dropping of Enid Blyton from children's libraries.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.280
But children love her books, was the cry.

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:22.040
You'd never hear people seriously argue that children should have lollies for breakfast just because that's what they'd prefer.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:27.800
The reason being that people know that something other than taste is involved, nutrition.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:39.120
And some children's literature critics try to make use of this analogy by talking about a healthy, emotional and intellectual diet for the proper mental development of children.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.620
And I'm afraid that sort of talk makes me feel a bit sick.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:03:00.640
I think, however, that one can construct an argument without having recourse to that analogy on the ground, that it's better in the long run for people to have experience of a variety of tastes, and even that some tastes are more satisfying than others.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:09.700
So the child who gets a proper balanced, nutritious diet, all tasting of lollies, is still being deprived.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:19.880
I believe you've probably come across arguments of that sort in relation to the supposed dehydrated, carefully selected tablet-formed meals of the supposed future.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:33.100
But the general point is, of course, that are made in those books, and that I'm making now, is that tastes can develop and they can improve, and that in our ordinary behaviour we assume that to be so.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:44.360
Even if you find some people, and some of them I'm afraid, colleagues of mine in English departments, arguing that all taste is relative and dig Gustavus Nornes Distruthandum.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.700
And therefore, that popularity is not necessarily the best index of merit.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:57.900
What we look for is qualified critics, the critics that we have learnt from our experience, that we can trust their judgement.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:17.000
Now genres such as children's literature and science fiction, which were some 70 years ago or so pushed willy-nilly into the class of popular literature, have, I'm suggesting, suffered from the temptation to regard popularity as an index of merit.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:33.680
So on these and other grounds, I think it's vital to keep fighting for critical recognition for the best books in our genres, and not to give up and disgust, no matter how irrational or prejudiced the opposition may be.

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:52.920
Now within children's literature, the impression I have after a few years fairly intensive reading and teaching, is that the majority of the best books published for children over the last 40 or 50 years have been fantasy of one kind or another.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.960
And the reasons for this are not far to seek.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:06.460
Phantasists found it virtually impossible to find an audience elsewhere, that is to get their work published except as children's literature.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:12.600
So fantasists, no matter how good, were forced to write for children.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:23.840
A realistic writer's work could get published as an adult book, even if it concerned a child or an adolescent, like a book like The Catcher in the Rye is a case in point.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.020
But a fantasist could not.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:38.400
And on the other hand, it's also true that fantasy was so despised, that one could get away with a great deal by writing in fantasy which one could not get away with in realism for children.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:49.020
So a writer who wanted to write for children would be likely to turn to fantasy to escape the cramping restrictions placed on pseudo realism for children.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:06:02.220
Now when I think of these best works over the last 50 years, I find that titles that come most readily to mind tend not to be works in science fiction.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.020
But if anything, they're oriented towards the past and towards historical fantasy.

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:20.760
I'm thinking of not only writers like Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, but Philip of Pierce from Tom's Midnight Garden, Alan Garner's Owl Service, Elador, Moon of Gomrath,

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:32.880
William Main's Earth Fasts, Lucy Boston's Green No Books, Mary Norton's Borrowers Books, and most recently, Russell Holman's Marvellous Book, The Mouse and His Child, which I recommend.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:42.180
Now I'm afraid that the reason for the absence of science fiction from the list is not far to see either.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:57.080
And that is this outlet. The outlet for adult science fiction was available in the magazines, which you've just been talking about, and which have played such an important part in the development of your genre.

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:12.200
And the depressing thing is that when writers can get the adult audience, especially if it's the adult male audience, that is what they'll go for, and leave second-rateers to fall back on writing for children.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:24.400
I say especially in adult male audience because we might compare the situation in children's literature of science fiction with that of the historical novel, the straight historical novel.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:34.280
You'll remember that the historical novel was disqualified in the same way that SF Set in the Future was disqualified from Consideration as True to Life.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.080
And you'll remember further that the genres pushed out into the popular literature category got market-typed.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:50.200
Well, it seems clear to me that science fiction got market-typed as male, and the historical novel got market-typed as female.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:59.300
The readership of science fiction is, I think, still largely male, and that of the historical novel is females and children.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:07.620
The historical novel has in fact flourished much more in children's literature than has, until recently, science fiction.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:17.780
And that clearly shows, I think, that where a genre is relegated to women and children readers, writers would have soon write for children as for women.

01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:27.240
But where they have an opportunity to write for a male adult audience, they will take it more readily and not entertain the possibility of writing for children.

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:39.060
And I suspect, although I might again be corrective, that the slow trickle of women writers into the field of science fiction has increased the chances of science fiction getting written for children,

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:47.260
since that's another amiable feature of the influence of sex stereotypes on reading habits that it's assumed that women will want to write for children.

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:58.340
Although I haven't come across as yet any work of science fiction for children, which is as good as the fantasy works which I cited earlier,

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:02.020
I have come across some ones that I think are very good.

01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:12.720
And one of the features which makes books less than first-rate, I think, is the assumption that issues must be simplified for children.

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:23.780
And one side effect of this is that you tend to get very clear statements of the going themes and perhaps prejudices in books for children,

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.420
which is in often itself to make them interesting, reading.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:38.280
So I thought that it would be of some interest to compare, in some detail, two children's books, which both seem to me to be very good, though not of the first rank,

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:47.160
one of which is science fiction, though not purely science fiction, and the other, historical fantasy.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.880
Both of these are described as mixtures, incidentally, in their blurbs.

01:09:52.060 --> 01:10:01.360
The science fiction book is described as a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, and the historical fantasy is described as a mixture of fantasy and truth.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:13.400
Now these two books, that's Madeline Lengel's Wrinkle in Time, which some of you might know, and Pauline Clark's The Twelve and the Genie,

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:21.560
both came out about ten years ago, I think in the same year, and Madeline Lengel's book won the Newbury Medal, the children's books in America,

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:24.720
and Pauline Clark's The English Medal, the Carnegie Medal.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.300
So I think they're very comparable as books.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:44.420
Now Madeline Lengel's book, A Wrinkle in Time, concerns three children who go on a quest through a tesseract or wrinkle in time in search of a scientist who's the father of two of them.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:53.860
They have to rescue their father from the dark planet Camazots, which is in the power of an evil force, customarily referred to as it.

01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:11.100
They're given some initial assistance by three aliens, I suppose they are, who in the form that they most frequently materialize before the children are three rather comic old women, which is really Mrs. What's It, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:28.380
Now apart from rescuing their father, the children are, in this action, participants in a wider struggle between the evil force represented by it and the rest of the universe, which is trying to resist being engulfed.

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:42.420
And we gather, though it's not explained, that merely getting their father back alive constitutes a major, though temporary, victory in this ongoing struggle, something like Don Kirk, in fact.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:49.500
Now the twelve of them, the genie, also involves three children and a rescue mission.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:12:12.820
One of these children finds in these three are siblings. One of them finds in the attic of their New Yorkshire home an old bundle containing twelve century old wooden soldiers, which he unexpectedly discovers a capable of coming to life, and that they have lengthy and interesting histories of former campaigns,

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:26.380
and names such as Buttercrashie and Gravy and Cheehee and Stumps and so on, and that they were formerly protected by some children, or at least humans, that they refer to as the genie.

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:31.220
And this child, Max, who discovers them, they refer to as the new genie.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:40.880
And Max and his sister, two of the children, become protectors of the gallant troupe. The troupe is known as the twelve, the children as the genie.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:56.520
They learn, however, that the toys of the former property of the Bronte family, who invented the stories and endowed the toys with the history that the toys recount to them, and whose former home, Horworth, is nearby.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:21.280
The existence of the soldiers, however, is a matter of historical interest, especially to literary academics, and an American professor offers to buy them for five thousand pounds, and the third child of the family, an older boy, who along with his parents and everyone else doesn't know of the special properties of animation of the soldiers, writes offering to sell them.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:31.580
And as the prospect of being sent to some American museum doesn't appeal to the twelve, the two children determine to return the soldiers to their former home at Horworth instead.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:48.940
But fittingly, the soldiers must be allowed to retain their dignity, freedom and independence by making the massive two or three mile trek themselves, at night and in secret, because the place is soon swarming with reporters and people both greedy and curious.

01:13:49.820 --> 01:14:04.440
And the mission is accomplished, as is the mission in wrinkle in time, with some nasty moments and mishaps, and the toys are returned to the Horworth nursery, where they are frozen wooden soldiers with featureless faces by day and living personalities by night.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:26.180
Now, the way that these two stories, which are both very interesting and readable, reveal some of the common places, as it were, of the genres to which they belong, is likely through theme and characterization, rather than through plot, as have indicated both plots are structured on the old rescue quest motif.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.620
But consider first the themes and characterization of a wrinkle in time.

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:44.380
The central character in that novel is a pubescent girl, who is introduced as a plain, awkward, misfit, warmly attached to her family, but not a failure at school.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:55.380
She has in fact the classical, ugly duckling attributes, raises on her teeth and mouse brown hair, and we can predict, I think, from these props that she will turn out to be a swan.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.580
The sibling to whom she is particularly attached, and with whom she shares her adventure, is her baby brother, Charles Wallace.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:19.780
Again, we can deduce that he is introduced as having, that he is special, from the fact that he is introduced as having the local reputation of being subnormal in the neighborhood, and we can deduce from that the fact that he is indeed a genius.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:35.780
But just in case we're in any doubt on that point, the third page of the story, when nothing much has appeared except Meg's thoughts as she gets out bed on a windy night, her reflections are extended to include the following reminiscence.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:54.660
Thinking about Charles Wallace, how did Charles Wallace always know about her? How could he always tell? He never knew or seemed to care what Dennis or Sandy were thinking. It was his mother's mind, and Meg's, that he probed with frightening accuracy.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:07.660
Was it because people were a little afraid of him, that they whispered about the Murray's youngest child, who was rumored to be not quite bright? I've heard that clever people often have subnormal children. Meg had once overheard.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:14.180
The two boys seemed to be nice, regular children, but that unattractive girl and the baby boy certainly aren't all there.

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:25.160
It was true that Charles Wallace seldom spoke when anybody was around, so that many people thought he'd never learn to talk. And it was true that he hadn't talked at all until he was almost four.

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:30.940
Meg would turn white with fury when people looked at him and clucked, shaking their heads sadly.

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:38.900
Don't worry about Charles Wallace, Meg, her father had once told her. Meg remembered it very clearly because it was shortly before he went away.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:43.660
There's nothing to matter with his mind. He just does things in his own way and in his own time.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.460
I don't want him to grow up to be dumb like me, Meg had said.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:56.920
Oh my darling, you're not dumb. Her father answered, you're like Charles Wallace. Your development has to go at its own pace. It just doesn't happen to be the usual pace.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:05.120
How do you know, Meg had demanded, how do you know I'm not dumb? Isn't it just because you love me? I love you, but that's not what tells me.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.700
Mother and I have given you a number of tests, you know.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:17.400
Yes, that was true. Meg had realized that some of the games her parents played with her were tests of some kind, that there had been more for her and Charles Wallace than for the twins.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:32.660
IQ tests, you mean? Yes, some of them. Is my IQ okay? More than okay. What is it? That I'm not going to tell you, but it assures me that both you and Charles Wallace will be able to do pretty much whatever you like when you grow up to yourselves.

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:37.700
You just wait till Charles Wallace starts to talk. You'll see how right he'd been.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:45.100
So of course, the two children are more than very intelligent. They're super intelligent.

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:52.520
There are, as you gather, two other siblings, twins who are nearly normal and don't therefore figure in the story very much.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:56.940
The third participant in the adventure is, in fact, from another family.

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:05.900
In fact, from an underprivileged family of 11 children, which we learn within the first dozen lines of dialogue out here at Peers.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.360
He's challenged in the woods by Meg and Charles Wallace going off to see Mrs. Watsett.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.500
And he's asked why he's there, and he answers, I just came to get away from my family.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:25.760
Charles Wallace nodded. What kind of family? They all have running noses. I'm third from the top of 11 kids. I'm a sport.

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.380
At that, Charles Wallace grinned widely. So am I.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:36.740
I don't mean like in baseball, Calvin said. Neither do I. I mean like in biology, Calvin said suspiciously.

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.740
And of course, Charles Wallace knows just what he's talking about.

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:46.000
Now, Calvin, I think he's 14, his description of his family is,

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:50.320
Ronnie knows nothings among whom he is a sport because he's bright.

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:57.200
Seems to me to be somewhat callow, but I accept it in reading the story because the boy's only 14.

01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:03.780
And since this book already presents itself as one in which family solidarity is emphasised,

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:11.340
one assumes that his contempt for his own ordinary family and his admiration for the special Murray family

01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:14.360
will be straightened out sometime later in the story.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:21.660
But what happens immediately is that the highly intelligent special Murray family takes into its bosom

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:28.100
and treats him like an orphan. The genius infant Charles Wallace invites him to dinner

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:34.700
and when Calvin denies an account of the invitation not issuing from Charles Wallace's mother,

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.420
who does after all, scientist or no scientist, have to do the cooking, Charles Wallace replies,

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:44.880
oh, she'd be delighted. Mother's all right. She's not one of us, but she's all right.

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:51.320
What about Meg? Meg has it tough, Charles Wallace said. She's not really one thing or the other.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.400
What do you mean one of us, Meg demanded? What do you mean I'm not one thing or the other?

01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.460
Not now, Meg, Charles Wallace said. Slowly, I'll tell you about it later.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:12.140
So the trio who are selected for the adventure consists of two male children who belong to a select group of geniuses

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:16.900
and a girl who has it tough because she's neither clearly exceptional nor clearly ordinary.

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:22.260
And what happens is, of course, that the girl becomes the heroine of the adventure.

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:28.080
An adolescent love relationship develops between herself and the 14 year old Calvin.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.380
The genius infant gets sucked in by the monster and has to be rescued along with the father.

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:39.240
Note that he gets sucked in precisely because he's the most intelligent and the most special of the trio.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:44.960
The girl manages to pull off the rescue of both father and then subsequently brother

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:51.920
because out of all of them, father, Calvin, Charles Wallace and herself and the father,

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:56.380
she is the one who has a gift which the monster has not got.

01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:00.220
She's told this, but she's not told what the gift is.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.800
And here's the climax. I bet you've guessed it already.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:10.040
When she has returned to the central chamber where the giant exposed brain, which is it,

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.460
has Charles Wallace imprisoned.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.320
There was a sudden sucking and she was within.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.920
It was as though the wind had been knocked out of her.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.640
She gasped for breath, for breath in her own rhythm, not the permeating pulsing of it.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:29.480
She could feel the inexorable beat within her body controlling her heart, her lungs, but not herself.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.080
Not Meg. It didn't quite have her.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:37.860
She blinked her eyes rapidly and against the rhythm until the redness before them cleared and she could see.

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:45.520
There was the brain. There was it lying, pulsing and quivering on the days, soft and exposed and nauseating.

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:48.540
Charles Wallace was crouched beside it.

01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:54.460
His eyes still slowly twirling, his jaw still slack as she'd seen him before,

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.680
with the tickiness for it reiterating the revolting rhythm of it.

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:02.020
As she saw him, it was again as though she had been punched in the stomach,

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:07.560
but she had to realise afresh that she was seeing Charles and yet it was not Charles at all.

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.220
Where was Charles Wallace? Her own beloved Charles Wallace.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.540
What is it that I've got that it hasn't got?

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.800
You have nothing that it hasn't got, Charles Wallace said proudly.

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.060
How nice to have you back dear sister. We've been waiting for you.

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:25.860
We knew that Mrs. Watson would send you. She's our friend, you know.

01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:31.340
From a pouring moment Meg believed and in that moment she felt her brain being gathered up into it.

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:34.700
No, she screamed at the top of her lungs. No, you lie.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.480
For a moment she was free from its clutches again. As long as I can stay angry enough it can't get me.

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:43.060
Is that what I have that it doesn't have?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.100
Nonsense, Charles Wallace said. You have nothing that it doesn't have.

01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:52.660
You're lying, she replied, and she felt only anger towards this boy who was not Charles Wallace at all.

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:57.760
No, it wasn't anger, it was loathing. It was hatred, sheer and unadulterated.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.560
And as she became lost in hatred she also began to be lost in it.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:06.560
The red miasma swam before her eyes, her stomach churned in its rhythm,

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.900
her body trembled with the strength of her hatred and the strength of it.

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:13.540
With the last vestige of consciousness she jerked her mind and body.

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.960
Hate was nothing that it didn't have. It knew all about hate.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.680
You're lying about that and you're lying about Mrs. Watson, she screamed.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.100
Mrs. Watson hates you, Charles Wallace said.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.200
And that was where it made its fatal mistake.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.980
For as Meg said automatically, Mrs. Watson loves me.

01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:37.220
That's what she told me, that she loves me. Suddenly she knew. She knew. Love.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:40.540
That was what she had that it didn't have.

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:45.100
She had Mrs. Watson's love and her father's and her mother's

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:48.000
and the real Charles Wallace's love and the twins and aunt Beese.

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:50.220
And she had her love for them.

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.600
And that of course is what she uses.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:00.320
So it's love. Family love which achieves the rescue.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:05.800
And that's what Meg has, that her male partners in adventure do not.

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.620
They have brains, she has love.

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:16.800
And in the final family reconciliation, Calvin is included as one of the elite Murray family,

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.220
which now has everything.

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.240
There are a number of points which I think are worth noting.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:30.080
But perhaps I should talk about them after I've outlined the character and theme of Pauline Clark's book, The Twelve Magini.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.580
The central character in this book is the young boy.

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.500
Once again, it's a young boy who has special gifts of intuition,

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.360
which make him the person for whom the toy soldiers come alive.

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:49.700
Once again, he's presented as intelligent, but this time just ordinarily intelligent, not a genius.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.920
Once again, there's an older sister who shares the adventure.

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:57.740
Once again, what they have to offer is distinguished carefully.

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.720
He is more intense in his reaction to the toy soldiers, more passionate.

01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:06.220
She is more careful, thoughtful and tender.

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:13.180
And once again, there's also a 14-year-old boy involved, this time as a said, a sibling.

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:17.520
And this book, an English book, avoids sex completely.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:24.520
The older sibling is in fact the one who threatens the safety of the twelve and is an airing child.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.980
You know, the typical childhood airingness, meanness, money-grubbing,

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:32.240
slightly bullying of younger siblings.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:41.340
The explanation of the soldiers coming alive that is offered is that the genius of the Brontes brought them to life.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.660
A metaphor for creativity, in fact, made actual and literal.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.390
But the children of the story, Max and Jane, are not geniuses.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.380
So why do the soldiers come to life for them?

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.080
And the explanation is predictable again.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:04.800
And when Max finally reads the Brontes' juvenile with the invented history of the toy soldiers called the young men,

01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:06.040
he reflects.

01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:11.260
And the genius imagined them all so real, he thought to himself, that the young men,

01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:15.640
that's the soldiers' name for themselves, still remember, they're still alive.

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.220
Could this be what it was?

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.360
And then he felt thinking of them in turn and which he loved best.

01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:26.940
He told Jane and his mother that nobody could love anything more than he loved the twelve now.

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.360
And this was true.

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:34.420
He wondered if this was another reason why they were so lively, because he loved them and they trusted him.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:43.400
And so it's again, the power of love coupled with the creative imagination which comes into play.

01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:50.060
There is a somewhat religious cast to the twelve and the genius, which is also present in a wrinklin' time.

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:59.200
In the twelve and the genius, a friendly parson is allowed to see the twelve's triumphal re-entry into Harworth's parsonage.

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:04.820
And the parson, Mr. Harworthson, thought, I cannot believe it, and yet here they are before my eyes,

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.600
such is the power of genius to make things alive.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.220
So do the creative genius echo their creator.

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:17.920
And this is a chord which is also struck in a wrinkle in time when Mrs. Watsit, the comforter,

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.660
explains that the children are not alone in their fight.

01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:27.300
And when not alone you know children came Mrs. Watsit, the comforter,

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:33.300
all through the universe it's being fought, all through the cosmos, and my, but it's a grand and exciting battle.

01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:40.180
I know it's hard for you to understand about size, how there's very little difference in the size of the tiniest microbe in the greatest galaxy.

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.980
You think about that, you think about that, sorry, and maybe it won't seem strange to you

01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:48.660
that some of our very best fighters have come right from your own planet.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.320
And it's a little planet, dears, out on the edge of a little galaxy.

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.820
You can be proud that it's done so well.

01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:58.420
Who of our fighters been, Calvin asked?

01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:01.320
Oh, you must know them, dear Mrs. Watsit said.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:04.280
Mrs. Who's spectacles shone out at them triumphantly,

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.400
and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.680
Jesus, Charles Wallace said, why of course, Jesus.

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:15.880
Of course, Mrs. Watsit said, go on, Charles, love, there were others.

01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:19.320
All your great artists, there have been lights for us to see by.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.780
Leonardo da Vinci, which Calvin suggested tentatively, and Michelangelo,

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:29.080
and Shakespeare, Charles Wallace called out, and Bach, and Puster, and Madame Curie, and Einstein.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:37.240
Now Calvin's voice rang with confidence, and Schweitzer, and Gandhi, and Buda, and Beethoven, and Rembrandt, and St. Francis, and so on.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:44.980
The family background in the 12th and the genie is comfortable, intelligent, middle class,

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.780
but it's much less important there than in wrinkled in time.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:54.000
And there is no, I'm glad to say, Cinderella-type rescue of a working class child

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.360
displaced out of its proper intelligence.

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:02.860
The genie at first.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.760
A funny name, it's always all it is, that soldiers give max.

01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:13.700
It gradually exposes its other conventional meanings of genius, a very creative intelligence,

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:19.080
and then the root sense, which is related to generate and creating life.

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:25.860
In fact, I have to say that although I consider both books good, I do consider the 12 and the genie better.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:30.580
Because it's a subtler book, I find it less offensive in its social attitudes,

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.220
and less partisan about the values it espouses.

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:40.500
Madeleine Lengel places so much emphasis on the superiority of brains in the early part of the book

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:45.800
that she has to make the apotheosis of the power of love very melodramatic

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.940
in order to counterbalance the emphasis of the earlier book.

01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:55.840
Now, although you might think it's a large conclusion to draw from illustrations just from two books,

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:02.440
I think that difference does arise from the fact that the science fiction writer writing for children

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:08.700
is aware that there is an alternative adult audience somewhere else for science fiction

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:15.500
and therefore is much more inclined to oversimplify and overdramatize when writing for children

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:19.940
than the writer of fantasy, historical fantasy, who has no real alternative.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:21.940
Thanks for listening.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:46.860
I'm going to go back to the way you think of...

01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.040
...Ruthard was very bad stuff.

01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:53.120
I didn't get past all the few pages.

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:57.240
What I really liked was that it was a great author and thought that I can't write.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.060
Yes, quite.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:03.020
Yes, quite. I had my book and I only read two or three of each of their books,

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.680
and I thought they were good.

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:09.760
The reason I chose the Madeleine Lengel book was because of the exact parallel in time

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.780
and treatment and things like that.

01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:14.380
I don't think I chose it as a prejudice choice.

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.620
Now let me see.

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:24.140
Yes, all I can say is that I do think the Darden and Orton and Dainlana are quite good,

01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:26.260
but I've only read one or two of each of their books.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:32.600
What are the reviews on the Madeleine Faraway tradition here?

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:35.280
Hmm, yeah.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:36.640
Yeah.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:42.260
Sorry, I can't really answer that with very much immediate knowledge,

01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:44.120
I never read it since I was a kid.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:53.280
I think, I remember rightly, people do seem to think that's Enid Bynan's best writing.

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.880
That's where she wrote the best.

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:04.320
What people object to is largely the limited vocabulary of her books

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:09.440
and the somewhat unhappy social attitudes that some of them present.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:13.040
Do you think they're not unlike the social attitudes of the Madeleine Lengel book, actually,

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.940
and that you find all over children's fiction,

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:21.660
but that Enid Bynan seemed to have less and less to redeem her?

01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:24.100
The point is that she wasn't sort of banned,

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:26.460
she just sort of fell off the bottom of the list,

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.760
where librarians have only a certain amount of money to buy books each year,

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.620
where the standard of children's literature has been rising over the last 20 years.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:43.060
She has simply gone down in merit as well as everything else because she's been surpassed, that's all.

01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:45.480
But apart from not buying new things,

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:48.060
but also around the old stuff, right?

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.500
They said it wasn't going to be replaced, yeah.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.060
I said they didn't actually take it out of the show?

01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:58.220
No, no, but you know, as books wear out, they weren't replaced, yeah.

01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:02.180
You compare English, French and insurance literature

01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:06.500
as being popular but not good because of that,

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:12.420
but in English, Christianity and other literature as being popular but not good because of that, yeah.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:15.980
We still find that there's an amount of Anglican Christianity in that as well.

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:20.700
Why not be involved in children's literature because of this topic?

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:26.640
Yeah, probably because children's libraries perhaps have less funds,

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:32.380
you know, that the collection will be smaller you'll find in the children's library than in adult library,

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:38.620
and granted that they have small funds, they feel that they have to be careful in their choosing.

01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:44.820
But it's also the fact that children's librarians feel, you know, the ones that I've talked to

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:50.100
feel that they have an important responsibility in selecting books for children,

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:55.260
you know, that you can in fact influence children's tastes by the range of what is available to them.

01:33:55.260 --> 01:34:01.100
And, you know, I think one would have to agree a child who never gets near, you know,

01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:04.120
any great selection of books is being deprived in some way.

01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:11.180
Agreed, and yet I think that if you take out the children's libraries and watch children's like,

01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:14.380
you're going to be able to work with them like this, yeah.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:20.420
Oh, yes, that would certainly be true if you use that as a criterion for putting things out.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.260
I mean, it doesn't work the other way.

01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:29.300
A book being popular doesn't mean that it's good, but it doesn't mean that it's bad either.

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:33.440
And to hear some of the elitist critics talk, you would think that it did.

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.820
You would, and you know, that strongly suggested by Henry James' attitude in that essay,

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:46.340
The Future of the Novel, you know, he seemed absolutely dismayed that the novel was galloping so in popularity.

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:53.140
He thought that simply being popular would reduce its chances of being art.

01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:56.060
Now, we don't call that, obviously.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:06.160
Oh, I think that there's nothing attaching to the form, you know, of pictures with balloons and so on,

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:09.200
that makes it good, bad or indifferent.

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.260
I believe we have exactly the same potentiality for being good, bad and indifferent comics

01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:18.140
as poorly text books have of being good, bad and indifferent.

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.780
Who? Dr. Rose?

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:26.180
Oh, I see, yeah.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:26.640
You read that?

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.540
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:37.320
Well, I think that, oh, a lot of the funny things that people say when they're talking about

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:45.460
children's books and children's reading have arisen out of the circumstances that I've been talking about.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.420
That is, they've been forced into an almost indefensible position.

01:35:51.680 --> 01:36:01.300
That, and the very fact that they feel very proper responsibility may make them all anxious about this or that or the other being good for children.

01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:12.200
Would I be right in thinking that in general, Australian writers of children's books are doing better at the

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:21.320
in satisfaction of how before you was not really too happy about how well you were doing that?

01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:28.480
They're doing jolly well, as you're probably thinking of the fact that I, for example, won the Carnegie Prize last year.

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:36.600
The peculiar situation with children's books is that it is so very international.

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:44.900
The translation activity, for instance, in children's books is much, much higher than it is in adult novels of any kind.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:50.120
And it's quite interesting to speculate about that.

01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.780
I'm not quite sure why it comes about.

01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:58.480
It may be because there's no children's books aren't likely to be offensive in any way at all.

01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:01.460
I don't really know, but in fact children's books travel.

01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:12.680
And of course the well-meaning people who promote children's books are also in favour of other general good ideas like international understanding.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:18.200
So they want kids to read books about how children live in other countries and things like this.

01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:20.120
All those sorts of factors might contribute.

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:31.520
I see Tolkien just recently translated as French, the one prize last year, the best quality of children's literature.

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.140
Do you think in Toghane, you know the reason in a children's book?

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:40.520
Well, I actually don't like the whole definition of a genre.

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:49.780
I think somebody in the panel before was wondering what we might gain from going for breaking down the boundaries,

01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:52.920
breaking down the notion that we have a specific genre.

01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:56.500
I'm very much in favour of that as far as children's books are concerned.

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:10.220
I was just thinking you're not only talking about the city of the town, the village, the ends of the carapace,

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:17.720
the city of the kids, the town of the recommended by adults and children.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:18.560
Oh, I see.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.820
I think I was really...

01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:21.480
No, quite.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.960
And you see this withholding from children of horrific material, I think,

01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:31.260
because only produced of massive underground in horrific material.

01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:33.560
You know that...

01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:37.420
Listen to children's playground rhymes.

01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:42.200
You wouldn't get anything more horrific than some of them.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:58.920
You were making about the professional librarians setting themselves up to form the public taste

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.960
and to form the taste of the children.

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:10.900
And it could go too far, but I think there are some dangers in seeking to do this.

01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:18.120
I know you can't go completely in the other direction and allow the level of taste to find itself.

01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:21.640
And as professionals, just follow the popular trend,

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:26.620
to start to be about the children's book of general.

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:36.140
I think that this is virtually the reason for the existence of the fandom such as ours

01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:43.700
in the... I've noticed that in over a decade of contact with a certain fandom

01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:53.600
that there is a continuous tension between those people that read what the literary call

01:39:53.600 --> 01:40:02.780
badly written books, which are very popular and which cater to a low level of public taste.

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:08.340
And books which they consider works of high artistic standard

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:15.180
and which the people who enjoy the more popular and badly written stuff find jolly hard to read.

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:23.320
And the fact that the literati discuss amongst themselves become a litis group in fact.

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:24.540
I see.

01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:32.580
One thing I've noticed in recent years is that the tendency for the two groups to more or less come together

01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:40.160
is the gradual increase in the taste and the gradual appreciation of qualities in the bad books

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:48.160
that the father literati of qualities make them good.

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.800
Well, they're in a series.

01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:50.640
They're horrible.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.740
In fact, they're just the nonsense.

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.200
Yes, of course.

01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:58.380
There's obviously a little private dispute in there somewhere, but...

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.860
I think that a cult, and I don't mean that as a pejorative word,

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:08.580
is just what you get.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:15.460
Like, you know, that Tolkien has a massive, sort of fairly private following.

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:19.600
It's just what you get when something is excluded from proper recognition

01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:23.460
and people feel that it ought to be talked about.

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:26.520
Sorry.

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:27.100
Be careful.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:28.340
Yeah.

01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:32.200
But I would like to...

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:39.180
I would like such groups not to turn their back on the possibility that what they actually want

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:45.460
is critical recognition for the genre, which once achieved, they can then dissolve themselves.

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.680
I mean, at least in a sense you can.

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.560
That is, to regard yourself as a pressure group.

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:59.560
You see, although I have started up a special course at Linder's called Children's Literature,

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:02.260
and that amounts to acknowledging that it is separate,

01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:06.640
I've done that because it's the only way I could get to teach it in a university at all.

01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:16.020
What I hope in time is that I will be able to persuade my colleagues to consider books like Alice in Wonderland

01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:19.920
when they're making up 19th century novel courses, you see.

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.180
And if that happens, then my course can go away,

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.920
because Children's Literature will have its proper place.

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.840
And I hope that you would feel the same about science fiction.

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:37.860
I was inspiring right before Children's fiction, or even Children's Science fiction,

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.800
and I have to say that it is a children's editor who has done it, rather than a child.

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:43.760
A child, yeah.

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.960
I was told when I was in London, I used to get into a school board, and it had too much social content.

01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:51.600
Yeah.

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.140
And children, simply love it.

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:56.860
I know you've heard the story over and over again.

01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:58.620
It was a bit of a children they love.

01:42:58.620 --> 01:42:59.060
Yeah.

01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:00.340
It was a bit of a children they don't like.

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:04.760
But these are children with too much social content.

01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:05.560
That's right, yes.

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:08.120
We all know children aren't interested in politics.

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:12.480
You should examine again the politics of any school.

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.820
Yeah, yes, quite.

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:20.360
I think those sorts of stereotypes are very limiting and harmful, you know.

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:29.300
I wanted to speak before, and I don't know if I can hear you.

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:31.960
Um, there we go.

01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:34.140
APPLAUSE

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.260
Friends like that.

01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:46.880
I was very interested in the way we referred to the fact that the fantasy writer doesn't have an outlet like the Science fiction writer,

01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:49.500
and turns to children's fantasy.

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:57.380
I also think there's another aspect here that there are some Science fiction writers who write children's books

01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:01.460
but choose to write in fantasy when they write for children.

01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:06.040
Especially when we're in the children's fiction, she writes our excellent Science fiction.

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:11.280
And speaking of herself as a writer, when I do write for children,

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.780
I would really prefer to write in fantasy,

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:21.060
because I want you to strip away the pseudo-philosophical pretensions of Science fiction,

01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:28.580
the mind game and all that goes with it, and bring it down to children's fiction.

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.800
It's very restrictive.

01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:37.680
I see. To try and do Science fiction at a lower level, you think, is not really on.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:44.220
Because once the ideas have to lose their complexity, they lose their interest.

01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:46.040
Yes, quite.

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:50.160
That's why there is love for the Science fiction writer.

01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.120
Yes, quite.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.960
I think there are some ideas which are at the same time simple and mind-boggling.

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.040
The books that I recommend, and highly The Mouson, His Child,

01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:08.080
is very much concerned with the idea of infinity.

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:12.000
It's a beautiful book. Really marvellous.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:20.280
Do you think we've got a right to counter-jazzing on children's fiction?

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:27.780
I can see maybe that Ed's a stupid name in the first, or you obviously read it.

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.500
I like it.

01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:30.760
I like it.

01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:40.840
It's more or less just plain plain.

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:48.280
That's what I was talking about today, but I am interested in old books that come out with a puffin on its cover,

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:50.760
or dragon on, you know.

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.920
In fact, that's how it happens often.

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.660
People submit a manuscript, and to their surprise, to get a letter saying it's been referred to the children's editor.

01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:04.640
When the Ocean of Great Books, there were two of them in America which were published just in novels.

01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:05.400
That's right.

01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:06.760
Which have a toughening print.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.340
That's right, yes. And it's gone the other way too.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:15.120
There are some, I think there was one prize-winning book, I think by Rue Mcgarden recently,

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.060
that appeared as an adult novel in America, and as a children's book in England.

01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:20.580
It shows how old.

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.000
But it goes the other way too, I'm afraid.

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.600
The next time you find out the story, the rather fine time originally children's novels,

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:32.760
and the coming adult novels quite effectively,

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:37.880
that probably weren't children's novels in the first place in front of the judges,

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:39.480
and the complexity of ideas.

01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:41.200
Well, they probably were, you see.

01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:44.700
It's just a publicly wondrous meeting, how much complexity children enjoy.

01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:46.780
I think that's really the safest.

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.520
I think I can probably use a hundred items on this.

01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:52.440
Yes, yes.

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:53.220
Yes.

01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:54.100
Well, I'm using three.

01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:58.180
What do you see?

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:01.940
I was going to ask you about talking down.

01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:08.080
Would you imagine that somebody who's been writing books for adults,

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.120
and consciously tries to write for a child,

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.240
probably does what you were suggesting, which is underage,

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.480
and the complexity of the content.

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:19.080
Yes, quite so.

01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.560
I would swear to that.

01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:26.140
I actually invite the students in my course,

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:27.540
who are third and fourth year students,

01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:31.280
to write stories if they want to, children's stories,

01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:32.260
for their assignments.

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:35.120
We have behind us the eminence to hiding,

01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:39.520
though I haven't been able to see converting something written originally into adult things,

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.480
and talking to children.

01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:43.540
He was talking about it.

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:47.040
Well, it sounded very much like putting it down to a little over.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:47.620
Quite, yes.

01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:51.660
I think that the degree of self-consciousness is...

01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:53.520
I've found that in thinking of it,

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.980
as children's book I found another literature.

01:47:57.580 --> 01:47:58.400
That's a sweet story.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.140
I'm not going down.

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:02.980
I'm not necessarily going down.

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.620
Might be going across.

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.960
Yes, quite.

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:11.240
Because it's easy to, for an established author,

01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.060
to run a fairly high-minded line, like C.S. Lewis does.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:15.900
He says,

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:20.300
what happens is you want to write a book, you write it,

01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:22.060
and you find that it's come out a children's book.

01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:24.880
I think that's a bit rubbishy, actually,

01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:30.500
because at least the Narnia books are among the most talking-down books that I know.

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:33.820
I think they're very good, but they're also extremely patronizing.

01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:57.000
The children don't mind it.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.320
I have to make a science question, right?

01:48:58.580 --> 01:48:58.800
Yes.

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.780
I carefully avoided actually drawing any lines

01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:03.500
because I wouldn't know how to do it myself.

01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:09.440
If there are a lot of better questions, I'm really going to end this here.

01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:13.080
Thank you for a very interesting talk with C.S. Lewis.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:52.200
alone

01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:01.000
and organized the extension of this.

01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:05.460
Unfortunately, unfortunately the show must go on

01:50:05.690 --> 01:50:09.600
and it must remain now contributed to the movement.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:13.880
So that's worth doing, I'll be the first to think.

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:47.780
I should have written this in my own language.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.220
As is the word.

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:56.000
Commonly experienced by general practitioners in the same age.

01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:59.120
Dependent diet, for one.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.520
But, as I've been on the search for this job,

01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:07.160
I must find out,

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:10.480
the search will become a disgrace.

01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:15.000
And the supernatural vampire,

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:18.120
which you must agree has such little creed,

01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:19.020
is quite impossible.

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.980
This is a thing of myth and legend.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.720
Grossly distorted by, oh yes, first life, tonight.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:28.620
Life's a place, watch out.

01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:34.400
Now, this is what you might call a traditional vampire.

01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:37.340
I'm glad to be.

01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:39.840
Thanks for the money you need to.

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:43.600
But I have a focus too.

01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:45.400
There you are, typical cave.

01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:49.180
Garp, the eye, the teeth.

01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:52.920
A definitely nasty piece of work.

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:56.700
But unfortunately the facts have been distorted in time.

01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:00.280
But the answer's come clearer with,

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:02.420
you apply a little medical science to the man.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:06.700
Traditionally vampires spend very evil lives,

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:08.200
commit suicide,

01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:12.180
or even then, don't know who took them.

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.380
And rise to the dead.

01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:17.860
With actual fact, medical science proves slightly otherwise.

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.520
Vampirin, obviously a disease.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:24.360
Transmitted, we nearly know the population.

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:28.700
In fact, we're going to describe its entire process.

01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:36.240
The vampire's course of the season begins with a bit of it.

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.160
And then the first symptom is had it on the set.

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:41.340
He dies.

01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:43.560
And I'm quite certain that place,

01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:46.460
when I ask, why doesn't the vampire die

01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.260
when in fact he apparently rises from the dead beginning?

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:51.220
Now it's as simple as he doesn't die.

01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:54.260
Now, actual fact that for the disease,

01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:57.040
obviously the metabodyte process is quite severely.

01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:59.960
He tends to go into a comatose state,

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:06.500
a deep comatose state sufficient to be called to explain the animation.

01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:10.640
The Russians prefer to call such a state anabiosis,

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:12.780
literally without life in the Greek.

01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:15.980
Other terms, hyperbiosis, well, I'm alive.

01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:18.980
And the one I prefer is cryptobiosis,

01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:20.140
hidden life.

01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:23.780
Because in fact, while apparently dead, it's alive.

01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:26.940
Now, a person in the cryptobiosis state,

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.040
what does one do with it?

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:31.960
So you put it on the tomb, or a crypt, or in the grave.

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:36.400
Now the second symptom is had it on set.

01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:41.660
Basically, the comatose state is not a permanent one.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:43.540
The person thinks they wake up.

01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:50.240
Now, if a person wakes up from apparently a dead state,

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:50.960
or if they're having a buried,

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.220
they're not going to get buried very far.

01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:57.000
Unless of course, as the ones who do,

01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:59.900
they come from the upper strata of society,

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:01.960
where in fact they're not buried in the ground,

01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:04.540
but buried in tombs or crypts.

01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.420
They find the buried and they get out of here.

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:09.360
So much was blue blood.

01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:15.180
Now, the other interesting feature of this disease is

01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:16.320
it's not a simple disease.

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:19.320
One would say it's like radiation, as it obviously is.

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:22.860
We're going to see the central nervous system side effect.

01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:25.680
Psychotic mania, next slide please.

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:30.380
This is not quite a traditional vampire, but you know,

01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:31.880
it's quite a certain thing.

01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:38.040
You have psychosis coming from the effects on the nervous system.

01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:42.560
The other mechanism is by a rabdo-type virus,

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:44.660
which presumes the car.

01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:46.420
Very well presumed to.

01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:51.320
It moves into a liver and attacks one of the RNA or DNA cofactors.

01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:52.940
Preferably a liver liver cell.

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:55.120
None of that goes for what biochemical in a liver.

01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:56.860
You can say anything about it.

01:54:57.260 --> 01:54:59.900
So you have these two diseases in the working concert

01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:04.640
that produce a single coherent system of symptoms.

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:11.280
Now, a lot of the side effects of amycomnesia

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:13.560
will obviously be central nervous effects,

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:14.560
and quite severe.

01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:20.080
Traditionally vampires are quelled by the power of the cross.

01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:21.540
Obviously, monsters.

01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:23.960
But if you think about it,

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:26.120
I don't think it's central nervous system in value,

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:31.760
so you would get things like intense morbid phobias

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:33.900
of religious symbols.

01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:36.900
So, fear of the cross.

01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:39.540
Possibly also fear of consecrated grammar.

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:42.720
I believe waiters.

01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:46.860
Additionally, as for things like running water,

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:47.900
obviously a bit.

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.000
Once of course they're disorientated so severely they can't swim.

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:54.780
Other side effects are quite interesting.

01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:59.220
The vampire, because he spends so much time in a microbiotic state,

01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:01.780
has his life span extended quite considerably.

01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:04.700
So in fact you get the apparent longevity of the vampire.

01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:12.520
And the other interesting effects is that the vampire is produced,

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:15.640
is brought into the state of actual hysterical strength.

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:17.920
Hysterical strength is one of the most curious cases

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:21.720
where the attainment of mouse-wives who involved in the pro-accident

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:24.940
and had a child in fact underneath the smarished car

01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:28.040
are quite capable of picking up and moving a car

01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:30.320
usually with about a tonne.

01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:34.680
Normally they end up with a lot of problems before it's in the bloodstream.

01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:39.500
But these creatures live in a state of perpetual hysterical strength.

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.160
Their metabolic states are greatly enhanced

01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:44.600
so they're much more biologically efficient.

01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:47.320
And being much more biologically efficient

01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:49.020
they become very difficult to kill.

01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:51.580
Being at simple wounds is a kill.

01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.860
Ordinary people are in fact short.

01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:58.660
It takes very massive wounds to destroy the vampire.

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:01.500
Therefore, decapitation is staking the heart.

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.120
Because the disease is so pernicious,

01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.820
viruses will last for a long time,

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:11.200
the only way to get rid of a vampire is to consume and pile that fire.

01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:15.580
The poor peasant vampires are presumably quite contained

01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:16.860
in very few other...

01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:17.900
The second and third side please.

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:23.380
This tends to ram the point over a little too hard.

01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:29.740
It does produce the effect of massive wounding.

01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:33.600
See about the focus of that something.

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:45.080
Vampirism we can now see just simply.

01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:46.640
Oh yes, the others are interesting,

01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:48.960
but there are three theories about why they're quite rare.

01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:51.380
One is the co-effect of fear generation.

01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:56.640
Which is very nice because it explains why it's taking the war

01:57:57.380 --> 01:57:58.360
taking it to the mountain.

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:02.600
The situation is that what happens when blood is in some particular

01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:05.460
because if somebody enzymes the package of axes

01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:07.480
then the blood is simply congealed.

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:08.820
So why do they need blood?

01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:14.620
The co-effect is a super molecule easily taken in the elementary canal.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.260
The other one is the hemolytic acid.

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:21.060
This one assumes that the blood can be cut out of the elementary canal.

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:24.120
One is to inject it all over the form of a tube tube.

01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:27.060
The third one is the cyclone to the game.

01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:31.680
Blood has got so many coronations in life.

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.360
The person who finds the periodicity dies.

01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:36.820
He obviously needs more life.

01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:39.080
So how do they go out and draw blood?

01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:43.980
The adaptions of being a vampire are quite severe.

01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:45.980
Many people can't stand this training.

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:51.400
Riding with him occasionally can stand currently and then take his blood.

01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:54.780
The ones in the base of that can survive longer.

01:58:54.780 --> 01:59:01.500
Also, the simple adaptions survive close to two to one.

01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:04.960
This is the director, regional anti-vampire control.

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.240
For night and blue enforcement activities,

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:09.940
attack and destroy the vampire now.

01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:21.040
The volume of the clock is very high.

01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:25.780
A modern man might be the most likely antelope to survive this disease.

01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:27.800
So if you wait...

01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:38.840
So much for psychology.

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:45.020
Where does that rest all at?

01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:54.020
Strike, but remember, only a massively destructive room can destroy a vampire.

01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:59.940
Stay and then watch out for the demonic spirit of the vampire.

02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:22.660
The next slide please.

02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:26.960
This is where we really go to ground.

02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:32.420
Next slide please.

02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:36.840
This is moving up the date.

02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:38.220
Next slide.

02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:41.840
Protections and things to come.

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:46.980
Obviously, the human future lies in space.

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.200
Mrs. Evian, next slide please.

02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:54.800
With focus, slide please.

02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:02.280
This is moving right along.

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:03.600
Polo type module.

02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:08.340
Next please.

02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:11.220
You've got to bang through all these clothes quickly.

02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.480
Just keep banging away.

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:14.240
Oh, I love that.

02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:17.300
Ah, the good old moon.

02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:18.820
A nice dead wall.

02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:20.840
Very little activity going on.

02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:22.260
A few odd things about it though.

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:25.320
A nice wall.

02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:25.960
A little different.

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:27.660
Change of scenery.

02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:31.460
This is what we hope to be doing.

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:33.120
Look, feel like a trailer.

02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:35.780
Continue.

02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:39.420
Now, this is moving out a little further.

02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:41.380
Some new real estate.

02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:43.800
I think it's a cool projection.

02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:45.440
Next slide, project theme, of course.

02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:47.020
American stuff, NASA.

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:49.360
A couple of blokes of Mars.

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:50.200
Please continue.

02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:54.400
Same again, going down.

02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:55.740
Actually, that's a Viking.

02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:02.920
I think the Moon Machine, I take it.

02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:07.940
Ah, well, keep flicking it, please.

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:10.540
Abstract out as one or not.

02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:14.600
This, of course, is Phobos, the moon,

02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:15.920
the planet is Mars.

02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:18.060
Interesting planet.

02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:20.160
Very low pressure.

02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:21.580
Lots and lots of dust.

02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:23.400
A lot of the weather is controlled by energy

02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:24.260
getting into that dust.

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:26.360
That's why it rises.

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:28.940
Jaws heat energy, just about the place.

02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:29.440
Continue.

02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:32.520
Up next.

02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:35.220
Any old common old garden asteroid

02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:36.380
being visited by Earthlings.

02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:38.060
Continue.

02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:42.840
Ah, yes.

02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:43.860
Venus.

02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:46.460
Very good if we'd done this one.

02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:48.700
Not quite as it would look, but

02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:50.260
optically that is.

02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:52.300
This would probably be completely blacked out.

02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:56.320
One more thing, pointy thing, like finger.

02:02:56.940 --> 02:03:00.340
Lightning, if you assume this was taken in infrared.

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:02.800
This has got a surface temperature around 1,000 degrees.

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:04.740
We have 700 degrees cold.

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:07.640
That would be about 450 degrees, say,

02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:08.980
centigrade.

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:09.840
Quite warm.

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:11.520
Atmospheric pressure.

02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:13.880
I had a guess, it was about 60 atmospheres.

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:16.120
A lot of difficulties.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.280
A YET classified as

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:22.080
a pyrolysis, which means hot and deep.

02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:24.020
Boys are hot and boys are deep.

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:27.320
Atmospheres would be like plastic

02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:28.220
or interesting stuff.

02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:30.060
Optically, it would be quite wild.

02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:33.460
Because of any light

02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:35.560
would be quite some peculiar angles.

02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:36.060
In fact,

02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:38.860
it's important you go and see.

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.540
But if you imagine a surface of a spear,

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:43.000
like a ball, and a light ray coming down,

02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:45.040
instead of going straight down to the surface

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:46.100
as would a normal light,

02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:47.360
and a light ray in an atmosphere like ours,

02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:49.520
it would be quite severely instead of landing

02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:51.000
at the point where it came straight in at,

02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:52.620
it would land somewhere on the other side.

02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:53.980
It would go out

02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:57.700
and land on that side.

02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:01.520
If anything, we're living in a planet like that,

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:03.060
it would have to use a sonar type system,

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:05.120
as would things like dolphins,

02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:06.680
oceanic creatures.

02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:07.340
Continue, please.

02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:11.040
That was going to come first.

02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:11.800
That's Venus orbit.

02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:12.360
Please continue.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:14.400
Jupiter.

02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:15.640
Continue.

02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:18.380
Let's have the solar system sat in.

02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:19.760
This one came out beautifully.

02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:21.300
How does this one look?

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:24.260
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:25.460
Okay, hang on.

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.360
Saturn again, on Titan.

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:31.080
Setting our size of week chart is absolutely beautiful.

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:32.920
Maybe we can't put it on my projection,

02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:33.540
but not too high.

02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:35.220
Saturn again, that looks better.

02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:37.140
Nice stuff. Continue.

02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:39.720
Seventh plane of the solar system.

02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:42.460
This planet has had a bad deal from science fiction.

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:45.500
Now I know, great science fiction stories are out here on Uranus.

02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:46.760
Continue.

02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:50.520
But Neptune's had a better deal.

02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:52.140
It's mentioned in a couple.

02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:55.860
Actually, that's why Uranus is a better deal.

02:04:56.020 --> 02:04:56.860
It's got about five moons.

02:04:57.740 --> 02:04:59.140
All got beautiful Latin names.

02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:00.580
Whereas,

02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:04.700
Neptune's got two, Triton and Neread.

02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:06.640
Continue.

02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:09.260
This is where we get out into the world.

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:11.140
That is the truth.

02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:13.460
Stars, continue.

02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:14.840
Just hammer away.

02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.440
This is where science fiction is going to go.

02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:16.960
Oh no.

02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:20.380
That is North America, would you believe?

02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:21.600
No.

02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:25.080
I shall demonstrate if I had a long point of things.

02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:25.440
I don't.

02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:26.400
Oh, you!

02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:32.140
What do you believe is the goal for Mexico?

02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:33.200
If you could say.

02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:33.980
No.

02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:34.620
I don't.

02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:40.920
Down to the river, you have to worry.

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:43.400
Continue, please.

02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:45.100
Some of these are incredibly beautiful.

02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:47.480
The focus is, that's the horse head nebula.

02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:49.220
A horse head.

02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:50.400
Continue.

02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:53.400
Andromeda, of course.

02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:55.280
Anyone can recognize the andromeda glance.

02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:58.020
It's only one and a half million light years away.

02:05:58.420 --> 02:05:59.100
So it's a long walk.

02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:03.960
This is called the Dumbbell Nebula in Valpeca.

02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:06.420
Dumbbells.

02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:06.820
Continue.

02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:10.520
That is the crap nebula.

02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:12.500
Absolutely swishable piece of work.

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:15.980
It keeps a lot of boffins busy because there's got all sorts of nice things going on in there.

02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:17.160
Lots of hot gas.

02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:20.700
A pulsar in here which is probably a neutron star.

02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:23.060
Having written an essay on it earlier this year, I should know.

02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:24.900
These are stars.

02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:26.340
Square things. Continue.

02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:29.780
Another galaxy.

02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:30.880
Very sweet. Continue.

02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:31.020
Continue.

02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:36.420
I would say smudgy stuff.

02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:38.320
That'd be...

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:38.760
That's a nebula.

02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:41.420
Continue.

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:45.260
Nebula's gas. Gas is bodies filled with...

02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:47.880
This is called the Rosetta Nebula in Monoceros.

02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:49.680
It's an absolutely beautiful figure.

02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:50.280
It was in focus.

02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:52.020
It's really swishable.

02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:52.800
Continue, please.

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.380
Another typical nebula.

02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:58.420
You might find anywhere in the universe.

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.600
Ah, what a great...

02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:04.560
Now this is the Pliadix.

02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:05.300
It's the same system.

02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:07.860
Which if you get a clear enough night you can see 21.

02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:10.380
These are blue stars.

02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:11.220
They're quite hot.

02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:14.080
They've only got a lot of expectancy to a mere few million years.

02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:16.360
They'll blow out beautifully in the night but quite soon.

02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:18.300
If you hang around long enough you can see them go.

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:19.760
Right.

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:21.880
That's also incredibly beautiful in focus.

02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:23.360
Another typical galaxy.

02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:24.920
Galaxies are quite interesting.

02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:28.400
It looks very much like you to have in life anywhere in the universe.

02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:31.380
You have to have galaxies.

02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:33.920
So if you move to another universe somewhere

02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:35.160
and it hasn't got galaxies,

02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:37.640
your chance of finding any life there are pretty miserable.

02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:40.780
Especially intelligent life.

02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:42.240
There's a beautiful paper.

02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:43.660
Scientific paper, mind you.

02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:44.440
Quite technical.

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:47.900
Approves the universe like what we see

02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:49.520
because we happen to be here.

02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:52.920
Because we live in a universe that's got galaxies

02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:55.420
and it's isotopically distributed.

02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:57.620
It means they're having to be intelligent beings.

02:07:57.940 --> 02:07:58.380
Hens are two different things.

02:07:58.380 --> 02:07:59.820
There's a different universe who can look out and say

02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:01.500
huh, why are we here?

02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:04.100
And the answer is because we're in a universe

02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:04.700
that's us,

02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:06.820
comically distributed and it's got galaxies.

02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:08.480
That's the answer kids.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.580
And I published a paper out of it too.

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:12.020
Bloody.

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:14.580
Anyway, continue please.

02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:17.220
This is a nice quick trip.

02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:18.200
Oh, right.

02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:18.920
I mean, yes.

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:20.640
That's something which I can't remember.

02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:21.860
Too many slides.

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.080
Continue please.

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:25.720
Ah, now we're really rooting them right along.

02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:27.960
This is a man going on long slides.

02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:29.020
Oh.

02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.540
Would you believe it?

02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:30.960
Continue.

02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:34.520
A bopstar.

02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:36.580
Actually, this is I think,

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:38.420
literally, 20 interesting ones.

02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:40.100
A blue, white,

02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:42.140
dwarf star and a large, red giant.

02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:43.780
None of the theoretical reasons are known.

02:08:43.940 --> 02:08:44.840
Well, sure system line.

02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:45.700
Very funny.

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.520
That one is either Zeta Algyri

02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:50.680
or Zeta Kansai.

02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:51.880
It's Algyri, remember?

02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:52.560
Continue.

02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:55.440
This is a swish.

02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:57.180
This is a hypothetical planet

02:08:57.700 --> 02:08:59.260
that is around a star

02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:00.640
that has gone nova.

02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:03.300
And in fact, the bright bit is the nova

02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:05.080
and the black chunk of red stuff

02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:06.860
is the planetary nebula formant.

02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:08.760
This planet would be hypothetically

02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:10.000
about the position of that planet

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.300
Pluto, the solar system.

02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:11.760
Continue.

02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:15.600
Now this of course is beta-wire

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:16.780
relying on the side.

02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:21.660
The slides were dropped earlier in the evening

02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:24.460
and a great chunk of them have been missing.

02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:27.400
And it's been a bit difficult

02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:28.720
to put them all together again in a hurry.

02:09:29.540 --> 02:09:31.940
Beta-wire is a nice binary star.

02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:33.640
It's sufficiently close

02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:35.440
for there to be an exchange of gases

02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:37.020
between the two stars.

02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:38.920
And because this tends to spin out,

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:40.240
you have to spin because they're turning

02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:42.400
on one another and you get

02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:44.120
this spiral coming out.

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:45.840
It must be a really fabulous sight.

02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:49.140
But here's present theory

02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:50.880
so there's not much chance of them in planets

02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:51.460
but then again,

02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:54.020
we might not be able to present theories yet.

02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:54.380
Continue.

02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:58.700
Now this is data cancerite.

02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:00.280
Obviously,

02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:03.700
a rather miserable place.

02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:04.500
Continue.

02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:09.060
Ah, that's well over.

02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:10.620
That's Mercury lying on the side.

02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:13.100
That is a Mercury in mountain.

02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:15.200
That is a solar sun.

02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:16.760
And that is a Mercury in plane.

02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:17.140
Continue.

02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:20.280
Ah, yes.

02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:22.280
Now this one is interesting

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:24.560
because this is one of your common

02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:25.760
or gone hypothetical planets

02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.020
going around out for Centauri.

02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:29.400
This one is a real pity about the focus

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.460
because very fascinatingly,

02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:33.600
there is a constellation up here.

02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:34.980
That constellation,

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.640
which we see in our skies

02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:38.520
and called Cassiopeia.

02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:39.080
In fact,

02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:43.140
on the planet going around out for Centauri,

02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:45.040
the stars would be very much as we see them

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:46.140
in the constellations.

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:47.340
Except in this case,

02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:48.360
there is a seventh star

02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:49.280
to our sun.

02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.480
People suggested that this constellation

02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.160
as seen from

02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:56.580
Centauri planets should be called the switch-flate.

02:10:57.140 --> 02:10:58.340
Actually, Stephen Dole called that.

02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:00.100
Must check away when he called that.

02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:01.660
Probably Vicious America, which he is.

02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:03.600
Vicious but he is American.

02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:04.820
Continue.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.620
Get even more viewers if you go along.

02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:07.960
Yes.

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:09.900
Here is one of your common or gone.

02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:12.920
Planets with intelligent life.

02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:14.100
It is not one of ours.

02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:16.520
Because of Britt's paint in this damn thing,

02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:18.120
you have got a Jotrelbank-type telescope

02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:21.480
and you have an alien spacecraft taking off.

02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:24.280
Actually, there is an alien city in things down here too.

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:26.040
Ha-ha, of course.

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.040
A PMG tower,

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.400
GPO-type tower, London.

02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:30.280
Hmm.

02:11:31.420 --> 02:11:32.820
How much imagination is in this game?

02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:33.700
Continue.

02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:38.560
Ah, now we can get on very seriously all night.

02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:42.560
That is a sort of primordial depiction

02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:44.680
of extraterrestrial life.

02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:46.520
And then you may have a perspective.

02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:47.600
Looks beautiful.

02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:50.300
Ah, that looks obviously focused.

02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:53.380
That is like a galaxy as seen from a planet.

02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:56.240
Going from a star along with a whole new galaxy.

02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:57.560
As one can guess.

02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:00.220
You have your great, ready-to-go galaxy here

02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:01.500
and these things here are the other stars.

02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:05.620
Perhaps one would say a globular cluster

02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:09.120
moving outside a galaxy.

02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:11.300
Of course, there is a pretty high velocity star.

02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:13.880
This means they travel a couple of hundred kilometers per second

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:15.600
that are moving out of the galaxy

02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:18.020
so they might have moved out an evolved life.

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:19.100
Continue.

02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:24.460
Now, this is getting really alien and alien life.

02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:28.960
This is a planet where there is great masses of carbon tetraploid.

02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:31.940
That is a glob of carbon tetraploid going up or an alien.

02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:35.180
There is more glob of carbon tetraploid than alien.

02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:37.880
A moon of some description.

02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:40.280
And of course, obviously, as you all guessed by now,

02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:44.240
this is a star inside probably a globular cluster like that.

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:47.420
Inside globular cluster, stars are sufficiently close to be

02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:48.720
within life months of one another.

02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:54.500
Which means that if there are any civilizations out there,

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.040
they would have a great chance to get around

02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:59.180
and form galactic empires.

02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:03.760
Because it would be quite easy to build interstellar space systems

02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:05.240
that can get out there.

02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:09.640
It will start as only a few light months away as opposed to light years.

02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:15.780
The only trouble is, the good guesses are globular clusters are old,

02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:19.120
which means they didn't have the heavy elements that we've got.

02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:23.600
That's to say, elements heavy in iron, uranium, cobalt, nickel.

02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:27.200
They probably couldn't form a machine civilization since we could.

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:29.280
But they might struggle along with plastics

02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:31.020
and there is a lot of things you can do with biology.

02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.440
You can build rockets to go along.

02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:34.580
Yes, I wouldn't...

02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:38.940
If you can guess this one, you could go off with not so much a bang,

02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:40.940
but a... other musiating sound.

02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:42.420
Continue!

02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:46.180
Ah yes, more extraterrestrial life.

02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:46.680
I guess.

02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:50.520
The next one, please.

02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:54.560
Oh, wrong one.

02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:57.420
These are typical pieces of extraterrestrial life.

02:13:58.020 --> 02:13:59.600
One of your typical Niven puppeteers.

02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:01.960
Puppeteers, they are interesting.

02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:04.560
I thought they seemed to be quite acceptable for the Valiant life,

02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:08.160
except there are some nasty things about them from a biological point of view.

02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:13.600
I mean, apart from the fact that you've got these eyes on the end of these...

02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:17.020
The idea of a mouth as an organ manipulation is very good.

02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:21.980
I must grant Nivens showing the incredible, the good originality in doing that.

02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:25.540
The three legs are a real foul up, though.

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:29.340
There are other problems involved.

02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:31.820
Basically, reproduction.

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:35.780
Niven is very coy about the reproduction of puppeteers.

02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:38.080
And if you're trying to work out how they do it,

02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:40.100
it's no wonder he's so coy about it.

02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:45.760
He implies that they are females of the species and are non-sentient.

02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:48.160
Actually, I wonder about that, Niven,

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.460
because the kizindi, or zindi, as one might say,

02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:55.000
presumably is supposed to pronounce the K,

02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:59.000
but unfortunately, because he's used a letter like K,

02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:02.580
which is silenced in a lot of uses, I tend to suppress his K.

02:15:03.020 --> 02:15:03.660
So I say zindi.

02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:07.600
Actually, there is a CZ sound in some of European languages,

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:10.620
which would be pronounced chun, which would be pronounced chinti,

02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:12.960
or a few accent dachsh, and for that, ha!

02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:14.020
It becomes kitty.

02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:16.960
So much for Larry Niven.

02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:19.980
He's going to rip some great chunks out of him later on.

02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:22.400
But anyway, as I said, ah yes, non-sentient.

02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:25.000
Because obviously the brain must get in the way,

02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:26.400
if you've got to have a womb in there somewhere,

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:27.560
so they've got to be non-sentient.

02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:31.260
Anyway, non-sentient female sex, that sounds suspicious to me.

02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:33.200
Obviously, a hang-up somewhere.

02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:34.980
Continue.

02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:37.600
This is where they go off.

02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:38.800
Praise yourselves, folks.

02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:41.320
Get out of the way, will you?

02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:45.240
Now you can go on your slides for a minute.

02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:46.060
Next slide, please.

02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:47.360
You're kidding, of course.

02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:51.040
Now I'll ask you to go on your slides.

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:55.420
This is to give you some irritation, here's a mammal.

02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:59.760
You're, of course, niggering it for the wrong reasons,

02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:04.960
because biologically speaking, mammals aren't all equipped with these.

02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:08.980
Well, gentlemen, try to look down their vests and check on them.

02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:13.420
In actual fact, mammals aren't mammals,

02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:16.020
not because they've got boobs, but because they've got hair.

02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:16.960
See?

02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:17.740
Well, it's a mammal.

02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:19.700
We can't see that slide, actually.

02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:27.260
Now, interestingly enough, there's no biological reason

02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:29.940
why you couldn't have a species, in fact,

02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:31.760
where the males didn't have mammary glands.

02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:36.000
And in fact, looking at what happens at the pre-cellular level,

02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:40.180
where you can, in fact, do some interesting evolutionary experimental work

02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:43.320
on raw biochemical, which has been done,

02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:45.140
I mean, this is the first time you're going to hear it, folks.

02:16:45.980 --> 02:16:48.660
I mean, you know, John Foistler said last night on television

02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:51.840
that science fiction was only 30 years behind science,

02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:53.000
while I'm going to catch up.

02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:57.600
One could have mammary males.

02:16:58.160 --> 02:16:58.820
Continue, please.

02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:00.480
Thanks for the memory.

02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:04.320
This is one of your other biologically interesting things.

02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:09.660
The ancients in their way tended to mug up these creatures

02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:13.740
like the oranthrops, so I can say normal, all the oranthrops,

02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:16.980
in other words, a bird man, a man with wings who flies.

02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:19.920
Very unsound, unstable.

02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:21.780
We can also do a sorts of thing too.

02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:23.300
Ah, yes, spinny and flurries.

02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:27.400
It was once pointed out to me that in the Edgar Wright horror story,

02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:30.260
the Martians must all be reptiles,

02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:31.520
when they were reproduced by eggs.

02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:34.140
Therefore, there's no need for these birds to have boobs.

02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:38.920
So, all those busty birds of boob and parra-soob.

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:39.680
Or they're half.

02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:42.320
In fact, they're a fake.

02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:44.040
Oh, my God.

02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.000
Edgar Wright's borrows his imagination was working overtime

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:49.740
for the wrong reasons.

02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:53.340
Continue.

02:17:55.940 --> 02:17:58.000
Now, this is beautiful.

02:17:58.580 --> 02:17:59.920
Now, everyone knows that science fiction

02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:01.020
writes its own science fiction.

02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:03.780
Why do they not realise that science writes its own science fiction too?

02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:06.500
Now, this is what one would call a common old garden.

02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:10.620
This is your photon-rotation-rotation-rotation principle

02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:14.220
that you have a really great type of light down here somewhere,

02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:15.880
and you square out lots of light,

02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:17.780
and it moves forward in the opposite direction.

02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:20.400
A typically spied idea.

02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:21.500
Next slide, please.

02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:25.880
A technical diagram of a photon-rotation,

02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:27.460
which the numbers haven't come out yet.

02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:28.620
Now, this.

02:18:29.220 --> 02:18:30.160
Oh, bloody hell.

02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:37.240
This is a reflective dish.

02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:38.880
Engines.

02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:42.860
Oh, bugger, I was saying.

02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:44.620
There's a little chuck-a-rocket.

02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:46.300
A life support unit up there somewhere,

02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:49.380
and a long thin thing for supporting it all.

02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:52.080
Now, the photon-rotation-rotation is a nice idea.

02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:54.220
Anyone can look at the calculations,

02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:56.620
and they can show you that a photon-rotation-rotation

02:18:56.620 --> 02:18:58.120
will get very close to the velocity of light.

02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:00.480
Therefore, it won't be taken advantage of all the little ballistic effects,

02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:01.600
like time dilation.

02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:03.360
The fact that the rocket gets shorter,

02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:06.720
actually, that's why, because it means you can invent problems

02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:07.920
for physics students which say,

02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:10.580
how can you get a battleship through a pair of barn doors?

02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:12.460
It doesn't move fast enough,

02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:15.820
and it shrinks down, and it takes through the barn doors.

02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:17.240
This is going to be exciting for all of you.

02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:23.000
You must admit, there's some beautiful realistic problems.

02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:24.640
There's one published in the Australian,

02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:26.760
in which some guy worked out as follows.

02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:29.220
Cinderella goes to the ball on the far side,

02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:31.300
which, of course, is only a light hour away from the Earth.

02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:34.060
Midnight, she's got to leave the ball,

02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:35.200
so she takes off fast.

02:19:35.780 --> 02:19:37.040
In a non-accelerating rocket,

02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:39.140
the acceleration power of the cat-guy can go in.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.020
But troubles back to the Earth.

02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:41.980
Now, the thing that does,

02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:45.420
Cinderella's made it back in time before the witching hour on Earth,

02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:46.540
her time, they say,

02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:47.760
was she turned into a pumpkin.

02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:49.980
First, she turned into a pumpkin.

02:19:49.980 --> 02:19:51.620
Second, she had to squiggle.

02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:53.580
She said, it's much better as a pumpkin.

02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:55.620
Next slide, please.

02:19:57.580 --> 02:19:59.220
Oh, no. Great.

02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:01.960
This is an absolutely beautiful slide,

02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.200
which is on a photon rocket

02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:05.100
that has come to

02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:07.860
has arrived in a planetary system

02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:09.700
that is a mere 30 light years away

02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:10.780
from the Trippin nebula,

02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:13.340
which has always colored stuff down here.

02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:15.360
An absolutely beautiful piece of nebula,

02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:16.980
it's an absolutely beautiful piece of work.

02:20:16.980 --> 02:20:18.740
I'll give a plug for the boxers' camera on too.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:19.140
Up.

02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:22.220
Continue, please. I'm shouting about that.

02:20:23.220 --> 02:20:23.900
Ha ha ha!

02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:25.100
Hold it right there.

02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:27.200
That's a good stuff.

02:20:46.980 --> 02:21:01.810
Right.

02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:22.560
It comes in a single quantum mechanics.

02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:24.220
And you can do a lot of things with this quantum mechanics,

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:25.880
but I'm teaching it in a visible physics degree.

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:27.260
Who's here too?

02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:28.980
Yes.

02:21:30.420 --> 02:21:31.460
Okay, you have this.

02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:33.060
Anyway, here you can read the writing, you know,

02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:34.960
but according to the geometry ideas it weighs,

02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:36.700
because this establishment then,

02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:38.100
that's the state that can go through walls

02:21:38.100 --> 02:21:39.460
bigger than four inches,

02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:42.120
or 0.1 meter.

02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:44.240
That's

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:46.960
there is objects whose associated weight

02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:48.540
functions decreased to about 1.

02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:50.860
2.7

02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:52.040
of their full amplitude,

02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:53.780
at about 1,

02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:56.920
about a tenth of a meter from the boundary.

02:21:57.100 --> 02:21:58.080
No, that's not true.

02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:00.580
It's too big or something like that.

02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:02.760
And this establishes them quite easily,

02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:04.780
because you work out what the mass of a ghost is.

02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:06.960
And it goes up to

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:09.440
about

02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:10.560
10 to the

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.200
minus 16 for an electron.

02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:14.660
And that's about a mass

02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:16.440
of about 10 to the minus 40 kilogram.

02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:18.640
They're quite light.

02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:20.360
Now, the ghost will have got this.

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:20.920
What happens?

02:22:21.660 --> 02:22:23.760
Any ghost that comes out of dead body,

02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:25.200
as they want to do,

02:22:25.580 --> 02:22:26.540
is quite easily accelerated.

02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:29.140
In fact, the energy to accelerate a ghost

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:30.260
to escape from oxygen,

02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:31.860
in finally,

02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:33.980
10 to the minus 38 joules.

02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:36.460
In fact, any part of the breath will accelerate a ghost

02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:37.340
clean off the earth.

02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:40.020
In fact, even the sunlight will squeeze a ghost off the earth.

02:22:40.020 --> 02:22:42.060
So the only ghost we'll ever do,

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:44.740
are in fact the ghost that's trapped inside old buildings,

02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:46.220
dungeon,

02:22:46.940 --> 02:22:47.840
gets down to speed,

02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:48.860
or get caught up in chains.

02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:50.260
And they're stuffed.

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:54.340
Now, ghost trapped in this unfortunate manner,

02:22:55.060 --> 02:22:55.900
are forced to remain,

02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:58.580
because after they've got caught up in the open air from oxygen,

02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:00.760
they soon become a kind of

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:01.540
rotative effect.

02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:02.580
And it makes an increase.

02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:05.700
It makes the magic ring get out.

02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:07.320
It's got all that

02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:08.940
so in fact,

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.400
if you want to lay a ghost inside,

02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:14.720
what you're going to do is calm down.

02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:16.320
It's not like I'm in an armor place,

02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:16.680
you know.

02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:18.600
Think about it, Mark.

02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:19.840
You've made some good of it.

02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:21.660
You need to like share it with them.

02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:26.080
This is the gym, Mark.

02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:26.460
This is the gym.

02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:28.580
There's some nice side effects in this,

02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:30.940
which I can't go all the way through, unfortunately.

02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:32.380
But in actual fact,

02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:34.420
you'll remember what Peter Donahue said about

02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:35.540
red-roof ghosts inside.

02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:37.680
In fact, this area does it quite nicely.

02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:41.220
Because ghosts are wandering around the place,

02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:42.940
oh yeah, you can all sorts of interesting things.

02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:43.880
About the real infection,

02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:45.380
the vision of the surface of ghosts.

02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.640
Must be less than any percent,

02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:49.300
or it might never be seen at all.

02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.260
So ghosts can only be seen

02:23:52.260 --> 02:23:53.740
under the movement of a core elimination.

02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:55.300
The human's trying to float down,

02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:57.480
and the water's out there, and you can push them to give the water.

02:23:57.760 --> 02:23:59.140
I got to hang up.

02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:01.220
I assume you can,

02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:02.240
but it will be more soon.

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:03.200
Also more than a month.

02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:07.460
You said plenty here in Europe.

02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:10.300
The other little things about this

02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:11.720
that they give is scattered radiation.

02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:13.580
And because ghosts obviously

02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:15.560
are parking in a great void out there,

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.340
the interesting effect is

02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:20.040
the scattering of shot-grain radiation

02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:21.660
by ghosts in flight to the universe

02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:22.860
would, well, therefore,

02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:25.080
be a major source of cosmic radiation.

02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:28.260
I don't think so far

02:24:28.260 --> 02:24:29.820
why I strongly should explain this to you,

02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:30.660
but unfortunately,

02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:33.360
they've been too little accounted for some reason.

02:24:36.220 --> 02:24:37.100
Also, obviously,

02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:38.960
the absolute temperature

02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:40.380
of our space is up.

02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:42.240
3 degrees Celsius at stand 12.

02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:44.300
And 3 is mostly except for the room.

02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:46.760
And just to talk about it now,

02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:48.880
it's possible the reason ghosts are cold

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:49.600
is because there's something

02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:50.760
that's in the space now.

02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:53.540
The air is quite, obviously, door is great.

02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:54.520
It's true.

02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:56.760
If this is called a deadly set thing,

02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:58.420
that was a ghost that actually cooled up the light,

02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.900
you know, the last thing I mentioned

02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:02.140
was that down at the end of the atmosphere,

02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:04.040
and it's like, oh, I'm going to do it one time.

02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:07.960
Yes, it's rather like that thing.

02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:10.700
That record goes up to say that ghosts only walks.

02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:13.420
When it's not over here,

02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:13.920
that doesn't mean

02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:15.420
when it's down, you're in Australia.

02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:18.380
It goes up.

02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:19.960
It's got a fantastic timing, I tell you.

02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:21.280
But even so,

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:22.800
ghosts are, I guess,

02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:25.260
there's some really, there's some really good stuff about ghosts.

02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:27.200
But because they're properties,

02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:29.260
it's possible that some

02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:31.360
they have certain figures.

02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:33.120
In other words, there are six differences

02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:35.180
on my imagination.

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:36.500
But you can be ghosts.

02:25:37.620 --> 02:25:38.060
It's up to you.

02:25:39.220 --> 02:25:41.540
And this would be the asymmetric way

02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:42.380
it functions, correct?

02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:44.080
Let me die of statistics.

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:47.340
Particles of various statistics would come up

02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:47.900
in some schools.

02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:49.500
And the other ones, the states,

02:25:50.060 --> 02:25:52.040
would be one in which ghosts are often spin,

02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:54.100
would be pinnaged up to what you find

02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:54.840
in the energy sector,

02:25:55.380 --> 02:25:56.420
which can be of no use.

02:25:57.520 --> 02:25:59.440
This is a highly satisfactory disposition.

02:26:00.020 --> 02:26:00.960
Why do you do it with physicists?

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:03.420
Why would my world be

02:26:03.420 --> 02:26:05.440
in this multitude of state and place

02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:07.280
and all the others hope you achieve?

02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:08.540
See, there's hope here.

02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:09.400
You're in an afterlife.

02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:11.520
Now, I think we've got to go on.

02:26:12.300 --> 02:26:13.260
This is sort of where I'm on.

02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:17.720
My sleep's on the paper.

02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:19.420
Ah, yes, there's more slide.

02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:20.040
It's locked out.

02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:21.040
I want a slide.

02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:24.140
Ah, yes.

02:26:24.980 --> 02:26:26.880
This is where we've got the extra dress to stay to be going

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:28.240
to extra dress to your technology.

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:30.680
The stuff which you can build if you've got the brains

02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:32.280
to boot from the time you're doing it.

02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:33.640
Ah, yes.

02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:36.620
This would be a typical monolith

02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:38.160
in orbit over a moon.

02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:40.640
What can't a moon be done?

02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:42.600
Heaven knows what a monolith does.

02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:43.700
They didn't bother to explain it.

02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:46.140
It's made for a lovely spot.

02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:46.640
Continue.

02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:51.020
Aha, a ring world with a pair of dirty digits.

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:52.840
I know those dirty digits they are,

02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:53.760
but not to worry about.

02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:56.500
I wouldn't talk too much.

02:26:57.700 --> 02:26:59.180
Now, the Niven's ring, of course,

02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:00.140
was a beautiful thing.

02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:02.180
I mean, it makes a lovely painting good stuff.

02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:06.180
But unfortunately,

02:27:06.380 --> 02:27:07.500
it's a lousy concept.

02:27:08.640 --> 02:27:10.260
I mean, okay,

02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:11.460
how do you build a ring?

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:13.900
One thinks to oneself.

02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:14.780
One could, you know,

02:27:14.780 --> 02:27:16.040
actually build tidal effects.

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:18.540
Tidal effects are sort of easy to imagine.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.940
You just simply take a can of water,

02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:23.480
roll it on a bit of string,

02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:26.280
and see if you can make it go rigid.

02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:28.300
In fact, the ring like that

02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:29.580
has to do things like

02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:31.380
staying rigid.

02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:34.540
The tidal effects are quite miserable.

02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:37.740
Putting it all together is horrible.

02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:38.900
Text light please.

02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:43.380
This is a better idea.

02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:45.200
So, Bruce and he is always best.

02:27:45.580 --> 02:27:47.300
Freeman Dyson's original idea was

02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:49.500
see Dyson decided to basically

02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:51.180
sneak into it and come think about it.

02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:52.860
If you want to reason out a problem,

02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:55.040
you do it in a nice, simple fashion.

02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:56.300
And he said, right,

02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:59.480
if there exists very large technologies

02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:00.140
in the universe,

02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:02.100
what are they like on the moon?

02:28:02.260 --> 02:28:02.980
What can they handle?

02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:06.140
He talked about in terms of imagining simple ideas.

02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:07.640
So he just simply said, right,

02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:08.940
let's take the mass of Jupiter.

02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:10.660
You can know what the mass of Jupiter is.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.680
And you take the output of the energy from the sun.

02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:15.060
And for most figures, you can work out something like

02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:17.100
Dyson's speed.

02:28:17.540 --> 02:28:19.800
He definitely didn't say, haha, he's got the Dyson's speed.

02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:22.000
He said, aha, and wrote it up in science.

02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:22.700
And got published.

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:25.760
It's fine. Actually, Dyson's an interesting quote.

02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:26.500
It's a digress.

02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:29.080
He's only got a PhD.

02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:31.140
In order to read, no one is degree at all.

02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:32.420
He's a proper Princeton.

02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:34.480
He's an advanced institute.

02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:36.660
You know, an institute of advanced studies.

02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:37.980
He must be a damn bright bugger.

02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:41.480
Anyway, to continue with the Dyson group,

02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:43.080
what he did was he just simply considered

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:45.780
if you smeared out all the mass of Jupiter

02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:47.260
into a thin sphere.

02:28:47.660 --> 02:28:49.220
The sphere was wrong. It was actually a thin shell.

02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:51.420
About two meters thick.

02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:52.760
Between the two, he said,

02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:54.500
I'm not going to put your speed on one side

02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:55.380
and bang your head on the other.

02:28:56.900 --> 02:28:57.980
How funny do you think it is?

02:28:59.020 --> 02:28:59.380
But,

02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:02.020
when people wrote in and said, aha,

02:29:02.020 --> 02:29:04.000
you build a thing like this around the stone

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.600
with four parts, because of tidal effects,

02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:06.880
he said, aha, of course you're right.

02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:09.540
So what he said is you have a lot of these things floating

02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:11.780
around the place like this, which is a ruddy-voked cylinder,

02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:12.480
no less.

02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:15.100
And if you say that this cylinder is about a mile in diameter,

02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:17.160
and say 10 miles long, which allows the sense of scale,

02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:20.400
if you say it's 10 miles long and about 20 miles long,

02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:21.260
you're probably better off.

02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:24.240
A thing like that, you can fill up no in.

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:25.960
You know, it's just diabolically easy.

02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:26.760
Just put it on layers.

02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:30.240
Now, let's see, what is the area of a thing like that?

02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:33.660
It's obviously about something like 2 pi r by L long.

02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:35.440
That's a good surface area to do.

02:29:36.180 --> 02:29:37.480
Well, let's say, what's that work?

02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:39.660
It's about 10 miles in diameter.

02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:41.740
It's about 5 miles.

02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:42.540
That's about, um,

02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:46.100
that's 30, and it's about 20 miles.

02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:47.900
That's 600.

02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:50.480
600 square miles on one level.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.120
And if you move the levels in,

02:29:52.420 --> 02:29:54.460
you admittedly lose your surface area,

02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:55.440
but you gain a lot.

02:29:56.080 --> 02:29:58.080
If you've thought about spinning an object like this,

02:29:58.200 --> 02:29:59.060
so that the outer layer,

02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:00.200
uh,

02:30:01.320 --> 02:30:03.480
with centrifugal force, which would throw you out

02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:04.980
because it's spinning around,

02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:08.040
you had an internal force

02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:10.620
of one gravity.

02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:12.200
As you work in the center,

02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:13.480
you have lesser gravities,

02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:15.900
and when you're in fact in store,

02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:16.980
what's the machinery?

02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:19.960
Uh, things like park lanes,

02:30:20.140 --> 02:30:21.520
for example, if you wanted to build one inside.

02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:23.820
It would be damn interesting to have a park,

02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:25.740
you know, like a great open park,

02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:27.420
like a forest built artificially,

02:30:27.420 --> 02:30:28.800
inside a cylinder,

02:30:29.460 --> 02:30:31.580
where in fact you had conditions of 10 gravities.

02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:34.260
I mean, models, you effectively fly through trees.

02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:36.200
That's what I've idea of, though.

02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:37.220
I like it.

02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:37.700
Continue.

02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:41.720
Stop!

02:30:45.460 --> 02:30:46.260
Later away.

02:30:57.420 --> 02:30:57.880
Keep your colours.

02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:02.240
More powerful than automotive.

02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:07.200
More buildings than a single...

02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:10.720
What a man!

02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:12.600
Yes, it's Superman!

02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:15.360
Rain-stained from another planet who came to earth

02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:16.420
with powers and abilities.

02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:16.860
Ah!

02:31:19.540 --> 02:31:22.120
Who could change the force of white rivers,

02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:24.500
and steal in his bare hands,

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.700
and who disguised as Clark Kent

02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:28.740
Miles Manage reporter for a great man's

02:31:28.740 --> 02:31:29.700
of violence at Newstay first,

02:31:30.060 --> 02:31:32.100
fights a never-ending battle for truth,

02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:34.400
justice, and the American world.

02:31:37.220 --> 02:31:39.000
You're going to have to have an action ready for that.

02:31:39.540 --> 02:31:41.140
You all want to know how Superman works?

02:31:41.660 --> 02:31:42.360
I'm going to tell you.

02:31:43.780 --> 02:31:45.060
He works fully on out, I think.

02:31:47.540 --> 02:31:50.440
He's going to describe what Superman does,

02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.860
and I know he would definitely want to know

02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:53.020
how Superman works.

02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:54.280
What do you think we'll do anyway?

02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:56.680
You can brag about it.

02:31:56.680 --> 02:31:57.880
He's going to break down exactly what he does

02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:59.500
and work out how he has to do it.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:05.320
Right!

02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:07.800
He can ban the steal of violence and he can steal anything.

02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:10.320
He can set an app, set a business, and make full-fledged

02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:11.780
a single ban. He can work out how to make

02:32:11.780 --> 02:32:12.880
multiple-mode money.

02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:15.340
He can look like a typical figure for a work of money,

02:32:15.440 --> 02:32:16.380
which I have involved in the do.

02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:19.660
He can probably help you find a typical work of money figure.

02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:22.380
Money, things.

02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:26.460
God, it's not one of those people who just

02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:27.100
like war.

02:32:27.900 --> 02:32:29.480
It's just a fun thing to be found out.

02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:30.780
Right!

02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:33.040
Now,

02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:36.380
I said I'll take pictures out of Mary Hill and I will.

02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:38.740
Mary Hill and I have a very cool thing about

02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:39.000
Superman.

02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:41.920
He called it Man in the Spirit, War on the Cleaning.

02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:42.820
Fishy.

02:32:44.240 --> 02:32:45.380
Ah, Fishy and then.

02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:47.340
That's got it.

02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:50.520
Right, his marketing hypothesis was

02:32:50.520 --> 02:32:52.140
that Superman is too strong, too powerful.

02:32:52.600 --> 02:32:54.560
He would tend to rip a female apart

02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:55.720
if he was copulating with it.

02:32:56.780 --> 02:32:58.700
He would ejaculate at loose, transonic

02:32:59.060 --> 02:33:00.540
velocities and punch holes in it.

02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:02.940
That's what I'm saying.

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:05.100
Superhuman power being more powerful

02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:06.780
in local roads would tear a way through

02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:09.500
a delicate body and leave a perpetrator to the city.

02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:10.920
But you'd then undergo

02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:11.740
um,

02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:14.200
sepsis and dying quite horrible.

02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:16.520
And in fact, if those guys were little

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:18.340
superhuman sperms could in fact get round

02:33:18.340 --> 02:33:20.320
and fertilize them on the snuffle of the good times.

02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:21.020
He was human.

02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:24.760
I mean, the sperms, the life-threatening, he was fertilizing human hate.

02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:25.760
And um,

02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:28.120
John H. Redwood.

02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:31.680
I think I'm not going to throw up.

02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:33.460
I'm not going to throw up.

02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:33.880
Now,

02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:36.020
in beauty and in fact, the main

02:33:36.020 --> 02:33:38.280
is stupid and it's um, it's humanoid.

02:33:38.940 --> 02:33:40.760
I mean, you've noticed the human point.

02:33:41.580 --> 02:33:42.240
Okay, Rose!

02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:42.980
Give it back!

02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:53.820
That's the kind of people that

02:33:54.460 --> 02:33:56.340
they're more powerful

02:33:57.580 --> 02:33:58.340
than a locomotive.

02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:01.240
They're able to leave

02:34:01.240 --> 02:34:02.020
tall buildings

02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:02.860
in a single bound.

02:34:03.700 --> 02:34:05.460
Look, I'm a guy. It's a bird.

02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:07.000
It's a pig! It's Superman!

02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:08.520
Yes, it's Superman.

02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:11.220
A strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth

02:34:11.220 --> 02:34:13.020
with powers and abilities far beyond

02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:14.160
those of mortal men.

02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:15.460
Superman,

02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:18.080
who can change the course of mighty rivers,

02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:20.360
then steal in his bare hands.

02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:22.580
And who disguised as Clark Kent,

02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:24.140
mild-mannered reporter for

02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:25.460
a great man to follow the newspaper,

02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:28.060
fights a never-ending battle for truth,

02:34:28.340 --> 02:34:30.160
justice, and the American...

02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:32.300
Oh, I don't know.

02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:33.860
Now, but he's killing me.

02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:35.220
Look, I don't know.

02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:37.300
He says all the maximums are cut in half.

02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:40.120
Cut on maximums is a lot more.

02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:41.480
I don't know.

02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:44.300
That's like when those dark-hats

02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:45.460
turned to the now-called

02:34:45.460 --> 02:34:46.260
human-dark-hats.

02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:50.140
Yeah, human-dark-hats are very good.

02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:51.220
Now, in dark-hats,

02:34:52.180 --> 02:34:53.920
those who saw the program

02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:55.440
Mr. Terrific, this is about

02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:57.080
a puny, full-retreat, few players, filled.

02:34:57.540 --> 02:34:59.760
And for one hour, he had the strength of a thousand men.

02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:01.100
Great stuff.

02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:03.660
Now, if you'd care to sit down and work out a power,

02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:05.620
but the realest weight

02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:07.860
of a man who had the strength of a thousand men

02:35:07.860 --> 02:35:09.900
on the train, and now he's in the plunge,

02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:11.860
he's like, well, put him in.

02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:13.640
A thousand times, come on, you're all in here.

02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:14.020
What?

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:18.140
You're working on every weight of a man.

02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:20.560
And you multiply the firm-stone,

02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:22.120
you divide it by a thousand.

02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:23.800
And you weigh the current weight of the ounce

02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:25.300
of an ounce and a half.

02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:27.480
So, give that an ounce and a half.

02:35:28.460 --> 02:35:30.600
So, right, let's give it

02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:32.140
the basic unit that we're going to work on.

02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:34.260
An empty unit, Mr. Terrific unit.

02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:34.900
One.

02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:37.300
Cut off with a thousand men.

02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:39.640
So, obviously, how about two men?

02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:41.340
Show us how to do it, will you?

02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:42.520
I'll give you a little more power.

02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:44.720
Now, let's take the right back to black.

02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:46.280
Black dwarf stars.

02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:48.700
Oh, I didn't want to give them.

02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:49.960
That's black dwarf planets.

02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:54.020
Now, we're taking you to really a neutron star.

02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:56.860
A typical neutron star is being taken

02:35:56.860 --> 02:35:59.220
massive as sun, and you can press it down

02:35:59.220 --> 02:35:59.860
to the sun's here.

02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:01.400
It's about that size.

02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:02.940
It's very massive.

02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:05.440
Now, what's the massive sun you've made here?

02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:07.700
Look at both gas models.

02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:09.540
You can put a back for that.

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:11.380
And it's in sun.

02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.180
You've got 333,500 times the mass in the air.

02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:18.360
Therefore, a neutron, you can worry,

02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:20.020
neutron planets, that's a safe.

02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:22.640
A neutron star is the whole far enough.

02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:23.800
We like a planet.

02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:26.420
You know, cool north and quiet down a bit.

02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:27.640
There's a planet.

02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:30.740
We like a planet, not a star anymore.

02:36:31.740 --> 02:36:32.920
You've got to set this back to the sun.

02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:33.420
We've got about three.

02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:36.060
Twenty-five minutes.

02:36:36.780 --> 02:36:38.800
And thirty-five thousand times

02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:40.560
the mass in the air.

02:36:41.880 --> 02:36:42.760
Press light, please.

02:36:44.220 --> 02:36:45.400
Killers watch, Mr. Black.

02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:52.080
Let's turn the model over.

02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:53.500
That's the first one.

02:36:54.060 --> 02:36:55.320
Back to the first, the other one.

02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:58.320
It shouldn't be in that place. Back to the other one, then.

02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:01.540
This one, yes.

02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:03.980
Superman.

02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:04.800
Okay.

02:37:08.420 --> 02:37:10.520
So, take the slide after this one.

02:37:10.580 --> 02:37:11.460
Not the one before it.

02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:14.360
Yes.

02:37:17.220 --> 02:37:17.860
No, no, no.

02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:18.600
I'm sorry. Get on, please.

02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:19.620
Superman in Australia.

02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:21.020
I'm sorry.

02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:25.040
You know, in the column,

02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:26.400
see, when I read the sort of stuff,

02:37:26.460 --> 02:37:27.660
they never bothered to rationalize

02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:28.620
how Superman works.

02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:30.640
Which was neat, because you could sort of...

02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:32.560
So, right, no way of knowing.

02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:33.260
It comes from Krypton.

02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:35.440
He's got all these superpowers, and that's it.

02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:37.080
If they got the work and they said,

02:37:37.140 --> 02:37:38.680
I would need the work, you know.

02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:40.780
They said Krypton's got a red sun,

02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:43.200
therefore the Kryptonians don't have superpowers

02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:44.120
and things like that.

02:37:45.300 --> 02:37:47.700
And he's got to be activated by yellow suns

02:37:47.700 --> 02:37:48.160
and things like that.

02:37:48.220 --> 02:37:49.500
You know, it's not really a nonsense.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.360
I mean, Kryptonite has Kryptonite work.

02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:53.660
It looks like a radioactive element, but they've no...

02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:55.100
Kryptonite is a universe, I mean.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:57.000
It's nothing like that.

02:37:57.560 --> 02:37:58.660
But we shall plan on.

02:38:00.100 --> 02:38:01.100
Put that slide out.

02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:02.100
Turn that slide down, please.

02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:04.760
There's some good view of it.

02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:05.800
It won't be in the future.

02:38:08.500 --> 02:38:08.860
Right.

02:38:10.740 --> 02:38:12.060
Their explanation for his suit,

02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:13.920
we hear, was that it comes from a heavier planet.

02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:15.920
We established it comes from a planet

02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:18.600
which we can say has got 300,000 pounds more gravity.

02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:19.740
See, it can't be a planet.

02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:20.700
It's nonsense.

02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:22.240
I mean, Jupiter's only got a surface gravity

02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:25.400
of about 4G or something.

02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:27.360
I mean, you know, 4 times stronger,

02:38:27.620 --> 02:38:28.880
you know, great stuff, back, back.

02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:31.960
If that's not being in steel bars and you're being...

02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:33.160
I think...

02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:35.100
Strong bits of wire, yes, it must be better.

02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:37.600
Right.

02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:40.000
But suns, obviously, nonsense.

02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:41.620
Nonsense. We'll come to that.

02:38:44.100 --> 02:38:44.900
Funny things.

02:38:46.140 --> 02:38:47.220
Yes, right.

02:38:47.220 --> 02:38:48.040
So, it's very...

02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:50.800
If it comes from a planet that's 300,000 times

02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:53.140
more massive as the surface gravity

02:38:53.140 --> 02:38:54.740
300,000 times out of the Earth,

02:38:55.340 --> 02:38:56.220
it has to be stronger.

02:38:56.540 --> 02:38:58.400
Not only do we have to be stronger, it has to be made tougher.

02:38:59.100 --> 02:39:00.380
Because otherwise, it would be on Krypton,

02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:02.640
and it would be tripled over in the flattened,

02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:03.760
you know, very thin paste.

02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:05.720
All over the planet, sir.

02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:08.980
In actual fact, you can work out that

02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:11.220
on a neutron star, if you drop

02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:12.600
something, you know,

02:39:12.980 --> 02:39:15.380
something like a small coin,

02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:17.940
in fact, it will liberate about as much energy

02:39:17.940 --> 02:39:19.540
as you can have a small nuclear weapon.

02:39:22.420 --> 02:39:23.440
But I think that makes

02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:25.780
a certain assumption, which I haven't had a chance to go over.

02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:27.640
I think that he can trip over

02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:28.760
on Krypton and survive,

02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:32.040
which means he can survive very powerful explosions,

02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:34.060
and bullets, and all sorts of things.

02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:35.460
Super-Sweeper comes easy,

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.240
because he falls 300,000 times faster.

02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:42.380
That means bloody fast reflexes.

02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:44.620
Between the entire surface system.

02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:45.900
He's speeded up.

02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:48.520
In fact, he would make 300,000 times

02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:49.600
faster than ordinary men.

02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:51.980
And if he had a nervous system comparable to ours,

02:39:52.140 --> 02:39:53.780
he'd be smarter, because he can think

02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:55.000
longer and faster.

02:39:55.640 --> 02:39:57.420
That means if he takes an hour to solve a problem,

02:39:57.540 --> 02:40:00.060
he'll take a human being 300,000 man-hours

02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:01.300
to think about it.

02:40:04.540 --> 02:40:05.400
X-ray vision.

02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:07.560
This one's almost easy, actually,

02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:09.520
because the optical tunnel affects the laser.

02:40:10.140 --> 02:40:12.360
So, actually, he's not looking at X-rays.

02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:14.200
His eyes are working like lasers.

02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:16.660
Now, if it's quite possible to think

02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:18.380
that he lives on a neutron star, we'll always grab it.

02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:20.400
Optical effects become quite weird.

02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:22.180
So, it would be quite natural

02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:24.520
for the inhabitants to develop

02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:26.460
eyes that would, in fact, be able to project.

02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:28.360
Work like a laser. Why not?

02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:30.280
I mean, it's there physically.

02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:33.120
I mean, the biology must take advantage of it somewhere.

02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:35.720
And let's see what happens.

02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:37.300
One of these other super-pads, flight.

02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:39.160
Now, flight is a funny thing,

02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:42.200
but we can get around that quite instantly.

02:40:43.220 --> 02:40:45.900
Now, all these big biological systems

02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:46.740
create this like

02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:49.460
men, animals, and dogs,

02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:51.340
and zebras and monkeys.

02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:52.740
This is the damn whatever they are.

02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:57.140
Biological evolution has to go on.

02:40:57.600 --> 02:40:59.620
I've got to go on in a gravitational field

02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:02.440
that is 300,000 times stronger than us.

02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:05.240
Matter doesn't behave like that,

02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:07.600
unless you invent something rather swan.

02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:10.460
And so, I invented a decay effect.

02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:13.520
I told the decay effect because I was too much

02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:15.300
to call it the jacarous effect.

02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:22.860
Anyway, that's a decay effect.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.460
A decay effect is one of the hypothetical effects

02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:26.620
which means that

02:41:28.020 --> 02:41:30.040
it stores up lots and lots of energy

02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:32.240
and it overcomes effects

02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:34.260
on very strong gravitational fields.

02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:36.160
So, matter can behave as if it were not

02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:37.600
in a strong gravitational field.

02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:39.800
Immediately.

02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:41.760
The planet can evolve.

02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:44.020
You can have ordinary biological evolution

02:41:44.020 --> 02:41:46.680
and by converting evolution you can get humanoid.

02:41:47.460 --> 02:41:48.560
Kryptonian, in other words.

02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:51.780
So, krypton exploded.

02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:52.980
Bang.

02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:55.960
Newtron starts, we don't know what exploded,

02:41:56.060 --> 02:41:57.760
it exploded, but you might get the occasional

02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:00.480
odd, straight, interesting element, like kryptonite.

02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:01.740
With a decay effect.

02:42:02.260 --> 02:42:03.460
Now, with the decay effect,

02:42:03.460 --> 02:42:05.860
we have a lot of interesting things to consider.

02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:09.520
Now, this means that Superman has got stored up in himself.

02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:10.960
Oh, for what? Energy.

02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:13.740
And this energy is quite simple.

02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:15.460
It means, in fact,

02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:17.460
that by him to survive on the Earth.

02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:19.020
I mean, he can...

02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:21.740
I mean, the point of fact, an ordinary man

02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:23.220
can leap quite readily into the Earth

02:42:23.220 --> 02:42:25.080
at a velocity of 1 meter per second.

02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:26.960
He can leap into the Earth

02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:29.640
at a velocity of about 300 kilometers per second.

02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:30.900
Actually, it's 333.

02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:33.520
But, this means

02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:35.240
it's about 30 times faster than

02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:36.340
he expected to watch him live the Earth.

02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:39.120
Which means he can hop around the planetary system quite happily.

02:42:39.860 --> 02:42:41.100
Which means he can really travel,

02:42:41.260 --> 02:42:43.160
but he's not really moving yet.

02:42:43.700 --> 02:42:46.360
With a cave field, you can do all the interesting stuff.

02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:49.200
A cave field would be a perfect safe gap

02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:49.960
for whatever he does.

02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:53.620
Now, the cave field, obviously, must be a response modulated.

02:42:54.060 --> 02:42:55.840
Which means that whatever runs up

02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:58.080
runs up in use, it modulates to overcome.

02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:01.220
Which means, in fact,

02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:03.380
he doesn't rip doors off a panel

02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:04.780
unless he needs to.

02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:06.960
It's when he leans on things,

02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:08.500
the response comes back.

02:43:09.020 --> 02:43:10.280
But then, to be rather new.

02:43:11.340 --> 02:43:13.440
This means he is virtually perfectly elastic.

02:43:14.720 --> 02:43:16.420
Elastic in the true physical sense.

02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:18.980
A claimant goes back to its original shape.

02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:20.440
Plastic means you take something,

02:43:20.620 --> 02:43:23.060
you deform it, and it remains conformed.

02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:25.780
Whereas elastic means it's in a certain state, shape.

02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:27.980
When you bash it, bang it, or jump on it,

02:43:28.060 --> 02:43:29.480
it returns to that original state.

02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:31.300
Perfectly elastic is invulnerable.

02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:33.340
Right, so we've got him invulnerable now.

02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:36.280
In fact, he can be just

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:38.420
merely invulnerable, and appear to have super strength.

02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:39.860
Because, you know, if he picks a car up

02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:41.500
and he's hit, aha, it's up there.

02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:43.980
And the car is saying, ah, you should be crushed to death.

02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:45.960
But the old cave effect is working way same.

02:43:46.160 --> 02:43:47.780
Right, if we keep pumping in the energy

02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:49.020
and keeping him in the same state,

02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:50.980
he would appear to be super strong.

02:43:51.420 --> 02:43:53.780
Because, in fact, all it's doing is he remains in the same state.

02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:55.520
The car can't fall, because it gets in the way.

02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:57.680
And the cave field keeps pumping in the energy

02:43:57.680 --> 02:43:59.100
and keeping him in the same state.

02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:01.320
Uninterested speculation.

02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:03.880
But, yes.

02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:07.080
Now, once we've got the cave effect there,

02:44:07.180 --> 02:44:07.780
the cave field,

02:44:08.380 --> 02:44:10.800
well, one, the effect, so we associate a field with it,

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:11.900
and get away and explain it.

02:44:12.180 --> 02:44:13.500
There's actually a thing called Wattless Power,

02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:14.840
which one finds about.

02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:17.680
What was powered interesting?

02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:19.240
It means you can pump energy in your system,

02:44:19.340 --> 02:44:20.980
and the Wattless Power doesn't do anything.

02:44:21.220 --> 02:44:22.160
It just sort of vanishes.

02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:23.720
You can take it out again,

02:44:24.140 --> 02:44:24.820
as though it's there.

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:28.140
So, in fact, the cave effect works like Wattless Power.

02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:31.800
And, well, I'll take you to the science of what was power,

02:44:31.900 --> 02:44:32.680
which I won't go into,

02:44:33.180 --> 02:44:34.480
because they tend to get rather confusing.

02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:37.640
But, effectively, with a cave field,

02:44:38.300 --> 02:44:39.440
and the associate cave effect,

02:44:39.700 --> 02:44:40.520
you can do most of the things.

02:44:40.800 --> 02:44:43.420
But, obviously, cave fields must have other side effects.

02:44:44.580 --> 02:44:45.900
And this is where kryptonite comes in.

02:44:46.260 --> 02:44:47.780
It's obviously affected by radiation.

02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:51.720
Now, here it comes in contact with the kryptonite radiation.

02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:53.480
It obviously does something that is cave field.

02:44:54.020 --> 02:44:56.780
It obviously draws energy back in the wrong direction.

02:44:57.200 --> 02:44:57.580
What do you do?

02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:00.060
We're getting somewhere.

02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:01.000
Very good tonight.

02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:02.400
Probably something to start with.

02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:04.380
Radiation obviously interferes with something.

02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:06.120
Now, a cave field must store information.

02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:07.040
It must also say,

02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:09.760
we're like Superman, so big, so tall, so such, such.

02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:10.280
Right.

02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:12.520
Now, this radiation seeps in,

02:45:12.660 --> 02:45:13.940
and it mucks up the information.

02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:15.960
So, right, Superman is 254.

02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:17.380
254.

02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:18.720
You've got to know that.

02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:19.920
Bang, it's in common.

02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:22.080
Right, that's red kryptonite.

02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:24.480
That's the other stuff I'm not going to bother about.

02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:26.840
But you get the tip of the idea.

02:45:27.260 --> 02:45:30.020
Now, again, activation effects by stellar spectra.

02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:31.560
Red suns were starved.

02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:32.960
Red suns are interesting.

02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:34.480
As far as I figure out,

02:45:34.540 --> 02:45:35.640
if kryptonite had a red sun,

02:45:36.380 --> 02:45:38.980
and it inhibited the cave field, as one might imagine,

02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:40.940
all the plutonium could cure that.

02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:44.300
So, obviously, the effect of a red sun

02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:45.660
must jam the spectral,

02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:47.840
must jam the level of the cave field.

02:45:47.900 --> 02:45:50.300
So, in fact, the Superman would really fly in the parks.

02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:51.820
A red sun.

02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:54.740
His cave field would jam at that level

02:45:55.140 --> 02:45:56.320
for a while, at this point.

02:45:56.840 --> 02:45:58.500
So, in fact, you couldn't even even fly around.

02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:01.820
And if you were up on the earth, going to jam,

02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:03.580
ah, yeah.

02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:06.840
Yeah, gold kryptonite's easy.

02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:10.060
It just simply jabs the input and output of energy.

02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:10.900
He's stuck.

02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:12.640
No superpowers, and he's gone.

02:46:13.540 --> 02:46:14.140
No worries.

02:46:14.140 --> 02:46:14.900
Family jam.

02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:16.980
Poisoning effects, right.

02:46:18.180 --> 02:46:19.960
But also, okay, question for you.

02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:21.000
What have I left out?

02:46:21.700 --> 02:46:22.040
Brain.

02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:24.600
Iron, hydrogen, grain, water.

02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:25.980
Why?

02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:26.520
How's it done?

02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:28.120
I'm fine now.

02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:30.620
Destroyers can't.

02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:31.940
Destroyers can't.

02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:33.180
That's why.

02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:33.660
Why?

02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:35.780
The blue straw is the Zara.

02:46:36.020 --> 02:46:36.880
You have no patience.

02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:37.780
Oh, yeah.

02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:39.820
How can we get far through the universe

02:46:39.820 --> 02:46:42.640
where we haven't looked at planets when they were with us?

02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:43.500
You didn't know how to read them.

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:44.340
I'll read bread.

02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:48.240
It's easy.

02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:50.200
If everyone's breathing, everyone's voice is gone.

02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:53.920
He would normally suffocate, except the cannibal will continue to destroy,

02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:54.820
or live in the state.

02:46:55.800 --> 02:46:56.880
He doesn't need to breathe.

02:46:57.180 --> 02:46:58.520
In other words, he's dying on the planet.

02:46:58.660 --> 02:46:59.860
That's right, he's dying on the planet.

02:47:00.500 --> 02:47:02.940
Earth, gold, kryptonite, iron, iron, iron, iron.

02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:05.200
He's invented it, isn't he?

02:47:05.260 --> 02:47:06.000
Pacing and cutting.

02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:11.520
Actually, I've taken all these speculations purely in terms of

02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:12.720
a neutron planet.

02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:16.600
The normal speculations, the normal speculations is in fact,

02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:18.840
neutron, see, talking with neutron planets,

02:47:18.940 --> 02:47:19.880
there's nothing he's known about them.

02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:20.500
They don't explode.

02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:23.160
But there is one bloody astronomical objective.

02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:26.480
We haven't seen, we think it's there, or was there,

02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:27.940
that did explode.

02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:29.380
None of the big bang.

02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:33.440
If kryptonite were the big bang, it might explain how well it's superpowered.

02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:36.140
Very quickly, that's what it looks like.

02:47:36.140 --> 02:47:39.980
It will also imply that in fact, as mass goes,

02:47:39.980 --> 02:47:43.140
he's got the mass of a galaxy's thought away inside him,

02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:44.440
which is in the form of energy.

02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:46.620
It's no wonder it's so bloody infrastructure,

02:47:46.820 --> 02:47:49.000
where you can't get enough energy up to a nuclear-rubble effect.

02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:52.480
Oh yeah, interesting effect when you look at it.

02:47:52.660 --> 02:47:53.020
Foundry.

02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:56.880
You have a potential barrier, or actually potential well,

02:47:57.080 --> 02:47:58.080
which has got so much potential,

02:47:58.320 --> 02:47:59.220
with anything that's very important.

02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:00.220
I mean, you know, it's like saying,

02:48:00.580 --> 02:48:01.780
you've got this incredibly deep well,

02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:04.540
and you walk up to the well, and you've topped something into it,

02:48:04.820 --> 02:48:06.120
and it's just forward, right?

02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:08.060
Yeah, it's like on top of a cliff,

02:48:08.060 --> 02:48:09.380
and it throws up the other cliff, and it goes like,

02:48:10.420 --> 02:48:12.600
sip, except in nuclear conditions,

02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:15.160
you get potential wells, and in fact, they're so deep,

02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:17.460
that in fact, you can't throw things into them,

02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:18.880
because they were black from it.

02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:21.480
So in fact, if he's got so much energy stored into it,

02:48:21.740 --> 02:48:24.260
he'll reflect the matter to what were there.

02:48:24.820 --> 02:48:26.360
This is the one that we need to be actually modulating.

02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:27.840
Otherwise, if he takes a step,

02:48:27.980 --> 02:48:29.200
he pushes it away with a floor underneath,

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.340
things like that, and he can just keep going,

02:48:31.460 --> 02:48:32.200
and it goes straight to the other.

02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:33.880
And that's being modulated.

02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:35.620
Ah yes, he's modulated, of course.

02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:38.440
It's made of, in fact, nothing's modulated.

02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:41.860
In fact, it's made of destructive forces.

02:48:42.700 --> 02:48:44.840
Not destructive, but it can quite easily

02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:47.760
make itself more like human beings.

02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:49.840
Ordinary human beings.

02:48:53.460 --> 02:48:55.760
Why? Why?

02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:56.760
Why have they?

02:48:57.540 --> 02:48:58.460
Why not?

02:49:01.420 --> 02:49:04.280
Why did you say that you're going to put a floor underneath?

02:49:05.980 --> 02:49:08.540
When he flies past the planet, he's going to red sun.

02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:10.640
Usually drops to the planet, he doesn't keep flying,

02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:11.280
like he said.

02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:15.020
Right, so, how can I have a DC-colored stuff like that?

02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:19.980
What probability would you say would it exist on the planet?

02:49:20.380 --> 02:49:23.500
I could say that it could be 350,000.

02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:26.060
One thing I don't have on the moon now is the planet.

02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:28.440
Right.

02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:31.540
So in fact, all those people who have been at the city

02:49:31.540 --> 02:49:34.420
with candor and a bottle will have a lot of tools.

02:49:34.420 --> 02:49:37.460
Not just that, but there's some from the visitors who have

02:49:37.460 --> 02:49:39.080
put the candor through the time barriers.

02:49:39.460 --> 02:49:41.360
Ah, why couldn't...

02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:42.060
Why fit?

02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:44.940
Do you see that, though?

02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:47.900
Not as Jim Harris as we fit.

02:49:49.260 --> 02:49:50.500
You're completely sick of it.

02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:53.200
We've got giants helping us.

02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:57.040
I think we're sort of...

02:49:57.040 --> 02:49:59.060
I thought you were going to put on a...

02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:02.140
I think we're going to put on some Andy Gromwells.

02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:05.660
Well, obviously, technology is the technology.

02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:08.060
Actually, we've thrown a slide. There's some interesting stuff.

02:50:08.300 --> 02:50:10.060
We'll put backwards, actually, rather than forwards.

02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:12.300
Okay.

02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:15.820
Superman typically breaking a chain of kryptonite.

02:50:17.780 --> 02:50:19.320
I'll go through them until you get through it.

02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:21.820
That's it.

02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:24.280
There should be three more after that, actually.

02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:24.980
You're all lying.

02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:27.220
I'm going to make the one you wouldn't want me to put in your bag.

02:50:29.140 --> 02:50:31.360
Well, this one shows Superman doing...

02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:32.340
Actually, this is incredible.

02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:35.180
A man who can do everything. Why doesn't he take over the world?

02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:36.480
Nothing to him.

02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:37.900
That's probably why.

02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:49.080
Because he's a kryptonite, a kryptonite of blow-gain.

02:50:52.780 --> 02:50:55.320
Actually, psychologically, the man would be incredibly interesting.

02:50:56.020 --> 02:50:58.120
Everyone says, you know, right, he can do everything,

02:50:58.380 --> 02:50:59.380
but where's the challenge?

02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:05.460
He's willing to help creatures which are, in fact,

02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:09.500
pathetically weak by his standards and incredibly moronic.

02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:16.720
Psychologies, but continue through the slides.

02:51:19.380 --> 02:51:20.960
Now we get to the funny one, I do.

02:51:21.360 --> 02:51:23.100
This is a funny one. I'll take three parts.

02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:24.180
That's the first one.

02:51:24.940 --> 02:51:26.000
Actually, it's the second one.

02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.160
There's someone off on the bloody slides.

02:51:29.460 --> 02:51:30.340
Show us the next one.

02:51:30.920 --> 02:51:32.160
That is the first slot.

02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:33.540
Show us the second one.

02:51:34.460 --> 02:51:35.280
That's the second one.

02:51:35.380 --> 02:51:36.500
We've proved it on the third one.

02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:41.580
The last one.

02:51:41.940 --> 02:51:44.240
Take that cassette off. We're going to go into the last one.

02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:45.820
We've been well-proven.

02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:47.760
They're quite fascinating stuff.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.020
The focus is off.

02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:50.800
Oh, yes, folks.

02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:53.040
I just had a time count.

02:51:53.720 --> 02:51:55.740
For those of you who attend the bank at 8 o'clock,

02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:57.700
you're going to intend to leave in half an hour later.

02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:02.640
We're sort of empirical type science.

02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:04.960
You know, sort of stuff you can work out

02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:08.120
if you look up the physics and the chemistry and the biology,

02:52:08.900 --> 02:52:11.200
and you want to back your brains out about it.

02:52:11.580 --> 02:52:15.340
But this kind of stuff, in fact, is what...

02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:17.300
Let's run the swab, though.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:19.380
They're all rather swab, actually.

02:52:19.840 --> 02:52:21.780
This is what you can do if you just use your imagination.

02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:24.740
What Brian Orles calls a Runcible Science Factor,

02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:29.480
as opposed to the empirical, which is more hard-line, rationalistic,

02:52:29.480 --> 02:52:32.840
and logical, which, of course, has got a lot of pleasure,

02:52:33.140 --> 02:52:34.520
but it's damn hard work.

02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:35.280
Continue.

02:52:35.660 --> 02:52:37.820
This stuff, of course, requires a lot more imagination.

02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:39.400
Now, let's go back to...

02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:42.700
Bishop Godwin's thing, very pretty, this weird idea.

02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:45.800
Quite squabbles of swans.

02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:49.380
Pegasus in, well, a boxy version.

02:52:50.140 --> 02:52:50.880
But to continue.

02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:54.880
Pretty bad, that one.

02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:56.820
It's quite a nice start, but...

02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:02.260
It includes a...

02:53:02.260 --> 02:53:03.980
Oh, well, let's go along.

02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:05.500
That's what the background feels, right?

02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:08.060
You're right. That is a flying elephant, of course.

02:53:11.460 --> 02:53:12.280
Flying elephant.

02:53:12.980 --> 02:53:13.380
Continue.

02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:16.480
Is it a directional record, please?

02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:18.180
Yes, it is, actually.

02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:21.740
That is a little fly...

02:53:21.740 --> 02:53:23.160
That one is a flying elephant.

02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:24.160
A flying elephant.

02:53:24.740 --> 02:53:26.200
About to swoop, actually.

02:53:27.080 --> 02:53:27.580
Continue.

02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:33.200
That one is up side down, but it probably doesn't matter with that one.

02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:34.840
Continue.

02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:38.760
That one is very pretty.

02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:41.240
Continue.

02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:47.380
Yes, an old crater.

02:53:49.060 --> 02:53:49.840
What a trot.

02:53:53.820 --> 02:53:55.260
Very nice.

02:53:58.240 --> 02:53:59.720
Another battle scene.

02:54:00.460 --> 02:54:03.660
A kind of armadillac, a few armadillas.

02:54:04.460 --> 02:54:06.860
Nasty growings in a groveiness.

02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:09.920
And armadillas.

02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:13.140
God, what a crowd.

02:54:15.020 --> 02:54:18.200
Much more like things rearing out of the ground like fish.

02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:20.340
Resting on top of one of them, obviously.

02:54:22.500 --> 02:54:22.940
Yeah.

02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:27.260
And these are mushroom type things which are floating in space, which is absolutely fantastic.

02:54:27.860 --> 02:54:29.720
That slide, Regento, is really stuffed up.

02:54:30.500 --> 02:54:32.980
It's pretty about that because they are very nice slides.

02:54:33.780 --> 02:54:35.140
That can't be...is that the last one?

02:54:35.440 --> 02:54:36.740
Well, is that on a little brook?

02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:38.140
Oh, that little brook. Yes, yes.

02:54:38.700 --> 02:54:39.360
Go ahead.

02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:46.840
It's actually a map of the galaxy, the diameter of about 10,000 light years,

02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:51.420
enlists the major astronomical objects within that space, centered on our sun.

02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:52.660
Continue.

02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:55.180
Here, these are our folks.

02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:58.520
That is a Dr. Who as William Hartnell.

02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:01.560
William Hartnell's Dr. Who.

02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:07.220
That's John Fertwee at a TARDIS console, modern version.

02:55:10.840 --> 02:55:13.000
I, Dalek, on what a high note.

02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:15.900
Next one, please.

02:55:16.060 --> 02:55:16.840
Oh, I'm fervent.

02:55:19.140 --> 02:55:20.260
More Daleks.

02:55:20.500 --> 02:55:21.200
Oh, beautiful.

02:55:26.740 --> 02:55:27.900
More Daleks again.

02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:31.660
It's quite discredited as well as Daleks.

02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:33.240
And then Dalek again.

02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:34.480
That's correct.

02:55:35.740 --> 02:55:36.820
What a green belt.

02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:39.340
That's Patrick Charlton's Dr. Who.

02:55:40.180 --> 02:55:44.940
This is a follow-up on Dr. Who and that's John Fertwee being supplied, right, Dalek?

02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:48.440
I doubt that Daleks is only supplied, but that's it, folks.

02:55:56.340 --> 02:56:00.740
The following knowledge missed up the verse in the Appleville,

02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:04.380
down which this presentation would have been impossible.

02:56:05.380 --> 02:56:09.680

02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:11.980

Thank you, the auction will now.

02:56:43.340 --> 02:56:49.680
Well, the first item on today's program is this deluxe edition of Skull Comics.

02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:51.480
Any offers?

02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:52.860
Ten cents, sir.

02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:54.640
No, sir.

02:56:55.540 --> 02:56:56.940
Tell them it's a big copy.

02:56:57.100 --> 02:56:59.400
The only one with a second page around the wrong way.

02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:01.440
Big mouth.

02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:02.980
Ten cents.

02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:05.540

That's a nice picture.

02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:11.580
That's a nice picture.

02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:14.040
That's a strange picture.

02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:15.560
Forty cents.

02:57:15.900 --> 02:57:16.420

02:57:30.340 --> 02:57:31.260
Right.

02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:36.480
Young lust.

02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:44.720
Don't be filthy. How much am I offered?

02:57:45.300 --> 02:57:45.520

02:57:57.560 --> 02:57:57.800

02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:04.060
Yes, forty-five cents. Do I hear anything more?

02:58:04.820 --> 02:58:05.020
No.

02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:07.600
God, sold to the man over there for forty-five.

02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:09.100
One number bill.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:10.800
Do they?

02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:11.720
What's your number bill?

02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:15.600
What's your number bill?

02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:16.500
Number six.

02:58:17.860 --> 02:58:17.960
Good.

02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:22.200
Right. How much am I bid for this Kona?

02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:23.280
Number six.

02:58:23.580 --> 02:58:24.640
Mine is a hundred dollars.

02:58:42.720 --> 02:58:43.320
Oh!

02:58:44.200 --> 02:58:45.040
What's your number?

02:58:45.260 --> 02:58:47.160
I think you make a ten cent interest.

02:58:47.540 --> 02:58:48.500
You know, they make you a good interest.

02:58:48.760 --> 02:58:49.760
Yes, I think so.

02:58:50.260 --> 02:58:51.100
He's doing himself.

02:58:51.860 --> 02:58:53.980
Now we have a Kona number seven.

02:58:53.980 --> 02:58:55.320
How much am I bid for this?

02:59:33.560 --> 02:59:34.200
Stop.

02:59:36.720 --> 02:59:38.700
Well, some of the small ones first.

02:59:39.700 --> 02:59:43.340

03:00:01.180 --> 03:00:03.540
Well, I think there are a couple of mine in there.

03:00:03.640 --> 03:00:05.720
So I'll throw in an autograph and push it up a bit.

03:00:06.580 --> 03:00:08.060
I think it's 50 cents.

03:00:08.060 --> 03:00:08.100

03:00:11.060 --> 03:00:12.180
I think it's 50 cents.

03:00:13.100 --> 03:00:13.440
Sorry.

03:00:14.340 --> 03:00:17.300
I think you should also come and tell me if you have any questions.

03:00:18.260 --> 03:00:19.940
We were also in the separate.

03:00:19.940 --> 03:00:21.520
We'll have to get you to the separate.

03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:23.000
I think it's broken up now.

03:00:23.160 --> 03:00:23.760
New worlds 18.

03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:25.540

I work after this actually.

03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:42.100
It's all about the stories.

03:01:42.200 --> 03:01:43.420
All about the stories, alright.

03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:44.560
Sex, he's storing them.

03:01:44.680 --> 03:01:46.160
He's just getting another 50 cent.

03:01:47.580 --> 03:01:49.000
They shouldn't know what to do.

03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:52.700

otherwise it should be open to everyone.

03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:24.060
We've got a lot of stuff going on here.

03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:26.540
We'll take one with a sign.

03:03:28.340 --> 03:03:31.400

It's a journey of nine for a dollar.

03:05:01.860 --> 03:05:03.020

Two dollars.

03:05:58.580 --> 03:05:59.920
That's why they don't send you copies.

03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:01.300
