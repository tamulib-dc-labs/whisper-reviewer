Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.100 --> 00:33.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.180 --> 00:37.660
And here are your hosts.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.940
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

00:44.520 --> 00:47.940
Clifford Simac is a veteran science fiction writer who has been producing short stories

00:47.940 --> 00:49.800
and novels continuously since 1938.

00:50.420 --> 00:55.400
Simac won the International Fantasy Award for his city series, Hugo Awards for his stories

00:55.400 --> 00:59.980
at the Big Front Yard, in the grotto of the Dancing Deer, and at the novel Way Station.

00:59.980 --> 01:04.300
And he was honored by his peers when they presented him with the Grandmaster Nebula Award.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.540
Simac's prolific output is remarkable when one learns that until his retirement a few

01:08.540 --> 01:10.740
years ago, he was a full-time newspaper man.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.500
We asked him how he decided to become a newspaper man.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.720
There was no decision because I think I'll always do what I want to write.

01:21.100 --> 01:26.520
And every review without a writing fiction or writing books or anything of that sort,

01:27.260 --> 01:31.040
it seemed to me that the way to write was to be a newspaper man.

01:33.340 --> 01:40.620
My mother, who was a very well-educated woman, had books in the house all the time and I

01:40.620 --> 01:41.100
read them.

01:42.020 --> 01:46.800
Now, we got a, despite the fact that we were poor, we got a daily paper.

01:49.200 --> 01:56.140
And she used to set the table by the light of a kerosene lamp and read it each evening

01:56.140 --> 01:57.440
after all the work was done.

01:58.480 --> 02:04.540
And I asked her at one time, I remember, if a newspaper carried all the news, printed

02:04.540 --> 02:05.960
all the news they were, was.

02:07.400 --> 02:15.580
And she, in the manner of that day, and because people were not as cynical as they are now,

02:15.820 --> 02:16.920
said, yes, that was true.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.580
And I asked her another question that I thought was important.

02:22.420 --> 02:25.820
I said, is all the news true?

02:26.180 --> 02:27.780
Is what the newspaper writes true?

02:28.360 --> 02:33.440
And again, with that rightly cynicism and faith that the people at that time had, she

02:33.440 --> 02:34.220
said, yes, it was.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.700
And that decided me, decided me to want to be a newspaper man.

02:40.680 --> 02:45.360
So, Simac did become a newspaper man, but eventually he found that the type of writing

02:45.360 --> 02:47.680
it required did not completely satisfy him.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.740
We asked him why he chose science fiction when he decided to write fiction.

02:52.500 --> 03:03.800
Because when I was a boy, I had read Jules Verne and I think H.G. Wells, although I don't

03:03.800 --> 03:10.780
actually remember any H.G. Wells works, but I must admit them, Edgar Allen Poe and Haggard.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.800
And I thought what a wonderful thing that was.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.780
I just had no interest in the field.

03:22.040 --> 03:27.060
I wanted to read it myself and I found out when I decided that I wanted to write, when

03:27.060 --> 03:32.880
I found out that newspaper didn't give me everything that I wanted in the writing field.

03:33.760 --> 03:41.860
I decided that on parts of my spare time, my writing, I naturally seemed to turn to science

03:41.860 --> 03:44.300
fiction because it was something I was quite aware of.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.620
I felt very sure that I could do the job of it.

03:49.520 --> 03:53.640
And I was quite fortunate, of course, because there was no competition at that time.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.920
If you could string the three sentences together and make a paragraph, somebody would buy the story.

04:10.680 --> 04:14.040
Simac's combination of professions is, on the surface, a strange mixture.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.880
After all, newspaper writing requires a lean, straightforward type of prose, whereas fiction

04:18.880 --> 04:20.160
requires much fuller writing.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.880
We asked Simac if he thought the styles required are significantly different.

04:24.420 --> 04:26.280
They are absolutely opposite.

04:27.840 --> 04:35.280
But I compartmentalized my life into two lives.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.620
When I went to work in the morning, I was the newspaper man.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.060
When I came home and sat down at my desk at night, I was a fiction writer.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.520
More on Clifford Simac in our next show.

04:58.740 --> 05:04.200
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

05:04.200 --> 05:07.340
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:12.780 --> 06:18.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.940
And here are your hosts.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.640
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

06:29.860 --> 06:35.020
Science fiction writer Clifford Simac has been publishing almost continuously every year since 1938.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.340
Right, but Simac's first stories were published several years earlier.

06:38.860 --> 06:42.200
Here he explains how his writing career got started and how it was temporarily stopped.

06:43.280 --> 06:47.860
I started my newspaper career in 1929.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.640
And my first short story appeared in, I think, 1931.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.640
And at that time I wrote several other short stories which were published.

07:03.540 --> 07:11.140
And at about that time the magazine, the all magazines, the science fiction magazines and all others

07:11.900 --> 07:15.180
ran at a hard time because the Great Depression came along.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.540
And so there was no market, or practically no market.

07:22.260 --> 07:31.920
So I dropped out and didn't do any more writing any other fiction writing of any kind until I think it was 37 or 38.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.800
And I started writing again because the magazines had come back.

07:37.580 --> 07:41.640
John Campbell had been named editor of a Stelman.

07:42.360 --> 07:46.360
And I felt fairly sure I could sell my work to John Campbell.

07:47.260 --> 07:48.820
So I started then again.

07:49.400 --> 07:58.200
And I think since 1938 to 1939, I think it's 37 or 38.

07:59.080 --> 08:03.900
There was only one year in which none of my work appeared.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.660
There was one year at this point.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.380
And I can't remember which year it was.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.260
And I have no idea why that occurred.

08:22.480 --> 08:28.100
So CIMEC became an early mainstay in John W. Campbell's stable of writers at Astounding Stories.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.020
We asked CIMEC why he thought his work appealed to Campbell.

08:31.660 --> 08:33.640
I've read a lot of John Campbell's work.

08:33.640 --> 08:50.500
And I knew it, John Campbell was a favorite of what we today call hard science fiction.

08:51.540 --> 08:54.720
And I thought that I could write that kind of science fiction.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.840
I did write what amounted to hard science fiction for some years.

08:58.840 --> 09:04.160
And then begin to turn it over to the softer science fiction, such most of which will.

09:05.060 --> 09:07.360
Well, most people write soft science fiction.

09:07.500 --> 09:13.160
They only a few in the old hands and maybe a few new beginners write the hard science fiction today.

09:20.060 --> 09:24.240
During the first few decades he wrote, CIMEC produced short stories almost exclusively.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.320
We asked him to tell us why he stuck to the short story form.

09:28.240 --> 09:33.740
A short story is the training ground for the novelist.

09:34.640 --> 09:41.380
You can learn a lot more from writing a short story than you can write a novel.

09:42.200 --> 09:47.060
It's shorter to write, somewhat easier to write.

09:47.960 --> 09:52.260
You don't have the time invested in a short story to do a novel.

09:52.260 --> 09:59.840
If you spend, as a beginner, probably six months or a year writing a novel,

10:00.060 --> 10:01.940
it fails when that's catastrophic.

10:03.360 --> 10:08.100
But during that same time you could write a half a dozen short stories

10:08.100 --> 10:13.400
and if only one of them sold, why okay, you have made a beginning.

10:14.320 --> 10:23.600
So it's the path that most people take to becoming, to becoming writers or long-going to work.

10:24.460 --> 10:31.760
And that doesn't apply only to the science fiction field but to any literature.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.320
More on Clifford CIMEC on our next show.

10:42.420 --> 10:44.980
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:45.320 --> 10:47.920
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:47.920 --> 10:51.060
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:32.140 --> 11:36.320
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:51.900 --> 11:57.220
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.520
And here are your hosts.

12:06.060 --> 12:08.000
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.700
Science Fiction author Clifford CIMEC has written numerous short stories and novels

12:11.700 --> 12:13.460
and he has won several awards in the field.

12:13.740 --> 12:16.940
Perhaps CIMEC's most famous and enduring work is his City Collection,

12:17.600 --> 12:21.300
a series of eight interconnected stories written in the 1940s.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.320
These stories featured mankind's reaction to a new situation,

12:24.320 --> 12:28.680
in man's relationship with an old friend, the dog, and a new one, the robot.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.940
CIMEC agreed when we call these stories a leap from his previous efforts.

12:34.060 --> 12:43.680
It was a leap because I always regard the city stories as a sort of watershed in my writing.

12:44.700 --> 12:53.020
I have been writing the early type of science fiction work up until then.

12:53.940 --> 13:02.680
And it seemed to me that something better could be done than was being done.

13:03.620 --> 13:10.200
Strangely enough, at about the same time, a number of other people seem to think the same thing.

13:11.620 --> 13:16.960
There's no accounting for something like that happening.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.940
We asked CIMEC what influenced him to write these revolutionary stories.

13:29.120 --> 13:43.900
I think it was my disillusion brought about by the war that made me write the City Series.

13:46.520 --> 13:50.960
It seemed to me that we were going through a horrible period in history

13:51.740 --> 13:56.280
and that much of human dignity had been shared away.

13:58.380 --> 14:03.720
That it was not the kind of world that we had lived in up until that time.

14:05.060 --> 14:08.480
And I found myself wanting to retreat from it.

14:09.480 --> 14:18.460
So I retreated from it mentally by going into another dimension, into another world,

14:19.680 --> 14:27.940
creating a sort of fantasy of myself and, as it turned out, others also were able to find some wreckage.

14:29.620 --> 14:41.460
I think if the City Series were ripped today, that they probably would not get the attention that they got back in the early 40s,

14:43.100 --> 14:52.620
I wrote them exactly the right type of stories, exactly the right time, without knowing I was doing it.

15:03.320 --> 15:09.640
John Campbell published the first seven City Stories, but he rejected the eighth. Here CIMEC tells us of its fate.

15:09.640 --> 15:16.580
The first seven were written fairly well one after the other.

15:17.900 --> 15:31.760
The eighth and final one, John Campbell turned down because he said he thought that he'd written it, he'd published enough of that of the City Series.

15:33.480 --> 15:41.420
And so when he rejected it, I simply threw it up on the shelf and figured it was one of my rejects.

15:42.940 --> 15:49.200
And then the writer took it down and I think I sold it to amazing stories.

15:51.100 --> 15:57.000
And I don't recall what they called it, but they put it out as one of their horrible titles.

16:00.800 --> 16:07.520
And then later on when it came out, it came out before my mind, it was, it joined the others.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.320
But it was the last one that was not published by a camera.

16:12.540 --> 16:15.080
On our next show, we'll talk about a ninth City Story.

16:21.760 --> 16:30.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:32.480 --> 17:38.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.680
And here are your hosts.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.240
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

17:49.440 --> 17:53.720
Science fiction writer Clifford Simac's most famous work is his story collection, City.

17:54.360 --> 17:59.060
This collection of eight connected short stories was first published as a body by Noam in 1952.

17:59.280 --> 18:05.200
Here's afterwards, Simac was persuaded to write a ninth City Story, Epilogue. Here he explains its genesis.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.440
Well, John Camel died.

18:10.000 --> 18:20.500
And of course all of us, all of us were shaken by his death because he was a comparatively young man and appeared to be in good physical condition.

18:23.000 --> 18:33.200
Some of the writers reverenced him. I'm not too sure I reverenced him, but I felt very kindly and totally, I was very badly hit by his death.

18:34.980 --> 18:42.400
And a group of the writers got together and said we'd have to put out a memorial to John Camel.

18:43.280 --> 18:55.200
And the best way to do it would be to put out the last issue of the oldest downing stories, not analog, but the oldest downing stories.

18:56.940 --> 19:10.720
And so they asked, I suppose there were a dozen or so people who had written for the oldest downing stories to write a story for the Memorial Lollies.

19:11.780 --> 19:22.220
And Harry Harris was the editor, told me, and he said, Cliff, if you will write a story, I wish you'd write another City Story.

19:25.520 --> 19:36.040
And I was reluctant to do that. I should have had a wait for it because it had been quite a number of years since I'd written a City Story.

19:37.580 --> 19:44.960
And I knew that I had, that I was a changed writer, but I was not the same man as I was when I'd written the stories.

19:47.300 --> 20:04.040
I worried a great deal about the propriety of writing another City Story because I figured that the last one, the last of eight, had wound up the story, the story of the Webster family, and that there was no need going further.

20:05.280 --> 20:15.140
But the more I thought about it, the more I began to see that if I was going to write something for that Memorial about volume, it should be a City Story.

20:17.100 --> 20:30.840
So for the first time, since I'd written them, I took down my copy of the book City and reread it, trying to catch the flavor and the spirit of the stories.

20:31.940 --> 20:42.960
And when I read the stories, I simply absolutely ate to rewrite them again because there are some awful clouties in them.

20:43.880 --> 20:51.840
But I knew even as I thought about that, that I couldn't do it because if I rewrote them, they wouldn't be a City Story.

20:54.120 --> 21:05.660
So I sat down and did my best to try to recreate the flavor of the other eight stories.

21:06.800 --> 21:12.220
I think I came very close to it, but not as satisfactorily as I've quite afforded to.

21:13.360 --> 21:17.260
Ace published the nine stories as a group for the first time in 1981.

21:17.260 --> 21:23.100
The robots in City are gentle, respectful entities. We asked Simac why he made them so.

21:24.260 --> 21:30.780
Most of the writers who had written robots before wrote of them as machines.

21:32.560 --> 21:38.060
And I wrote of them as surrogate human beings.

21:40.160 --> 21:50.800
I made them people with some of the biases and prejudices that the living human would have stripped away from them.

21:51.980 --> 21:56.940
And I tried to make them the kind of people that I would want to live with.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.600
More on Clifford Simac on our next show.

22:06.340 --> 22:15.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:59.920 --> 23:04.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:19.680 --> 23:24.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.300
And here are your hosts.

23:33.820 --> 23:34.900
This is Daryl Lane.

23:35.080 --> 23:35.700
And Bill Vernon.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.360
Science Fiction author Clifford Simac has been writing for more than 50 years.

23:39.580 --> 23:48.660
All his work, especially the well-known pieces such as City, A Choice of Gods, and Way Station, is characterized by a warm, sentimental flavor that never clois.

23:49.360 --> 23:53.760
Simac's Midwestern roots and values are evident in his work, and the reader is caught by their charm.

23:53.760 --> 23:57.340
We ask Simac if he purposely worked his philosophy into his works.

24:39.600 --> 24:43.600
Not all of Simac's characters are model citizens, but none are ever terribly evil.

24:44.260 --> 24:46.940
We ask Simac why evil plays so small a role in his work.

24:53.760 --> 25:05.440
I'm aware of friendship, love, and good fellowship, and honesty, truth.

25:07.280 --> 25:15.460
I get very concerned at times about the condition of the world, not only now, but in times past.

25:16.720 --> 25:23.300
And I know what there is evil, but I kept it at times late.

25:23.740 --> 25:31.820
Not consciously, but simply because I guess I didn't want to think about it.

25:31.840 --> 25:37.800
I concentrated on the things I said before on the things that seemed important to me.

25:45.460 --> 25:51.720
Did Simac ever dream back in his early writing days that science fiction would become a fixture in commercial literature?

26:16.240 --> 26:20.240
I was thinking around hoping nobody would notice you.

26:22.260 --> 26:27.020
You were the bottom of the heap. There's no question about it.

26:28.200 --> 26:34.680
You were much more despicable than maybe the pornographic writers of today.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.840
But we kept at it because we liked it.

26:41.500 --> 26:50.320
I think after a few years of it I'd begin to feel that probably it would develop in my head of future.

26:52.420 --> 27:03.180
But I never think that we would be putting out as great and suitable progress as we have.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.540
How does Simac want to be remembered as a writer?

27:07.300 --> 27:09.360
I don't know if I will be remembered.

27:10.840 --> 27:30.060
But if I am to be remembered as a writer, I'd like to be remembered as someone who votes honestly and who is more concerned with the heart and mind of humanity than with humanity's achievements.

27:37.400 --> 27:42.100
