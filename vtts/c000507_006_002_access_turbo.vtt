Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show so stay with us

00:27.820 --> 00:33.580
this is the Science Fiction Radio Show a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy

00:36.260 --> 00:37.980
and here are your hosts

00:41.520 --> 00:50.960
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson collecting is a hobby or an obsession that
many people engage in. Coins, stamps, antiques, people collect almost anything and

00:50.960 --> 00:58.120
science fiction fans are certainly no exception. There are a fair number of
science fiction collectors scattered around some are so called completists who

00:58.120 --> 01:04.900
accumulate anything related to the field while others concentrate on a
particular thing. Many science fiction collectors for example collect books

01:04.900 --> 01:11.940
either paperbacks or hardbacks or magazines having to do with science fiction or
fantasy. The Science Fiction Radio Show spoke with two serious collectors

01:11.940 --> 01:19.240
recently each with a different background in a different area of interest. The
first is John Marks, a chemistry professor at Texas Tech University in Lubbock,

01:19.240 --> 01:27.120
Texas. The second is Bob Wayne, the owner of fantastic worlds bookstore in Fort
Worth, Texas. We asked Bob Wayne what kind of science fiction material he collects.

01:27.120 --> 01:39.980
At this time my main collections I'm collecting things by Philip Jose Farmer
Michael Moorcock and Harlan Ellison and so i just concentrate you know

01:39.980 --> 01:48.540
essentially on finding things that i don't already have and i work off of
bibliographies and lists and try to find things are in in better condition than

01:48.540 --> 01:59.660
the ones i already have so looking for for for hardcover books that are you know
where they're published in small quantities and looking for paperback books that

01:59.660 --> 02:09.140
are published under pseudonyms or from small presses or the things that require
the most attention for finding them at inexpensive prices. John Marks goes about

02:09.140 --> 02:19.380
it a little differently. i started out with paperbacks and uh the digest
magazines i've gone back in uh terms of get it picking up the old pulp magazines

02:19.380 --> 02:29.120
to the point where now i have almost all of them that were ever published
starting back with Weird Tales in 1923 and Amazing Stories in 1926 i'm very

02:29.120 --> 02:39.100
proud of my complete collection of weird tales since i understand there's only
about 30 copies or so in existence and uh just about as good on astounding

02:39.100 --> 02:50.660
science fiction for example. Recently i have been branching out into hardbacks
also but i'm a long long ways from complete on that what about paperbacks well i

02:50.660 --> 03:01.080
have about 14, 15 000 is that enough for you we asked john marks if he picks up
all paperbacks or just certain kinds there's always a problem in making the

03:01.080 --> 03:11.080
where do you draw the line but i basically get everything that's clearly science
fiction um everything that's clearly fantasy i kind of draw the line someplace

03:11.080 --> 03:21.940
in the horror vein to one side and maybe fairy tales on the other side and uh
sometimes i'll draw the line at uh you know uh an atom bomb story that's setting

03:21.940 --> 03:32.480
them near future or something like that but basically i get every hard every
paperback in science fiction and fantasy. We asked Wayne what he would advise a

03:32.480 --> 03:40.060
reader who wanted to turn collector well first thing i would do obviously a
person is going to come in and say i want to start collecting has already read

03:40.060 --> 03:48.800
some stuff so i would say to them what have you read so far give me the name of
some authors that you've enjoyed some books that you've liked. I would

03:48.800 --> 03:59.540
springboard off of that to pointing out things that i would feel there would be
you know good collectible books within their field of interest so that was how

03:59.540 --> 04:08.280
you know i would handle that particular situation. We asked Marks the same
question and he had much the same answer. Probably what most people will do when

04:08.280 --> 04:18.060
they start is they will pick a favorite author or authors and try to get all the
books by that person somebody with a limited budget just starting think you know

04:18.060 --> 04:26.500
that's it's a pretty good first step to say for example get every book a copy of
some edition of every book that Robert A. Heinlein has written or Andre Norton

04:26.500 --> 04:36.440
or or you name it whoever whoever the person happens to like and uh once they do
that and if they if they start getting the collecting bug then pretty soon

04:36.440 --> 04:45.400
they'll want to trade in those later printings for first editions and uh then if
they've really gotten into it they'll want to trade in those first beat up first

04:45.400 --> 04:53.540
editions for better first copies of the first editions when they do it they'll
probably start expanding into into other authors, More on collecting on our next

04:53.540 --> 04:53.820
show.

05:01.300 --> 05:09.240
this has been the Science Fiction Radio Show a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:09.240 --> 05:26.380
Odessa Texas. 

05:33.220 --> 05:47.340


06:04.620 --> 06:06.620


06:34.620 --> 06:40.960
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. We are talking with two collectors of
science fiction books, John Marks, a chemistry professor at Texas Tech

06:40.960 --> 06:48.520
University, and Bob Wayne, owner of the Fantastic Worlds bookstore in Fort
Worth, Texas. We asked Bob Wayne what makes a book valuable, a collectible item.

06:49.160 --> 06:58.940
Well, from the simplest standpoint, what makes a hardback book collectible to
anyone is simply supply and demand, and that there are more people wanting the

06:58.940 --> 07:08.300
book than there are books available at cover price. Usually this doesn't take
place, obviously, until after the book is out of print. But oftentimes, science

07:08.300 --> 07:17.880
fiction fans will see a hardcover book and they'll say, hmm, well, if I wait a
year, I can buy that in paperback. And they'll pass the book up. And then when

07:17.880 --> 07:24.140
the book comes out in paperback, they read it and discover it's the greatest
thing since they put raisins in bread. So they go back and they want to buy it

07:24.140 --> 07:31.520
in hardcover for a durable copy. However, at this time, the publisher has
probably already either remaindered the book or allowed the book to go out of

07:31.520 --> 07:39.360
print when all the copies were sold by the people who did buy it in hardcover.
And the supply of people out there looking for the book and demanding, I want a

07:39.360 --> 07:49.100
copy of book X, and no books being available, forces the price up on the
collector's market. The other things that can cause a book to become valuable

07:49.100 --> 08:00.180
are usually errors in the same way that a stamp being printed upside down would
cause a stamp to be valuable. If a publisher decides to accidentally destroy all

08:00.180 --> 08:10.580
the copies of a book so that only a few hundred exist, or if only a few copies
are made with some variation that was corrected in another edition, this also

08:10.580 --> 08:20.080
can cause a book to be valuable. And then you also can have a situation where
you create a book just to make a book valuable. That would be the case whenever

08:20.080 --> 08:28.580
you have a strictly limited edition where it's signed and numbered. What would a
real prize be for the collector of hardback science fiction books? John Marks

08:28.580 --> 08:38.240
answers this one. Well, it depends on what you're talking about. For example,
here's an example a lot of people would know about. Frank Herbert's Dune,

08:38.440 --> 08:47.680
hardcover the first edition, is worth a great, great deal of money simply
because Dune wasn't that well known when it first came out, didn't attract that

08:47.680 --> 08:59.720
much attention until slowly over several years, and that first hardcover edition
is extremely hard to find. So that in good condition, I understand that a first

08:59.720 --> 09:07.940
edition is worth a thousand bucks. Well, I don't have a copy of it. I wouldn't
mind having a copy at all, although I wouldn't pay that money for it. But I know

09:07.940 --> 09:17.720
somebody who found one in the garage sale in Lubbock. That bugs the heck out of
me. It wasn't me. We asked Marks how much a valuable science fiction paperback

09:17.720 --> 09:28.340
might be worth. Well, I could tell you the highest price I've heard anybody
charge for anything, and that was, and I don't know that they got it, this was

09:28.340 --> 09:41.360
the asking price, was $175 for Cat in a Canary House by Kurt Vonnegut. And that
book, which is his only collection of short stories and which are all

09:41.360 --> 09:49.960
unabashedly science fiction, he vows he'll never allow reprints as long as he
lives, and there aren't all that many copies available, so the price of that

09:49.960 --> 09:58.140
thing has been really escalating. I got my copy for $3, I don't mind telling
you. With such prices for single books, collecting seems to be a good

09:58.140 --> 10:07.700
investment. We asked John Marks if it was. My advice to somebody who wants to do
that is you've got to know a heck of a lot about this field before you're likely

10:07.700 --> 10:18.800
to be very successful at it, going about it from that standpoint, because just
because something is old doesn't necessarily mean that it's especially valuable.

10:19.080 --> 10:27.720
And what's real, it would be really difficult from the investor's standpoint,
from somebody who knew very little about the field, is to know which books to

10:27.720 --> 10:36.100
pick up now because 10 years from now they're going to be worth a lot. In fact,
that's kind of hard for me to guess. And I certainly know more about it than a

10:36.100 --> 10:39.740
lot of people do. We'll continue with the subject of collecting on our next
show.

10:46.920 --> 10:54.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:54.700 --> 10:55.440
Odessa, Texas.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.320


11:20.300 --> 11:22.140


11:51.820 --> 11:52.480


12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:11.260 --> 12:20.980
and here are your hosts. This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

12:21.820 --> 12:27.740
John Marks a professor of chemistry at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. His
passion is collecting science fiction books and magazines, and he has many

12:27.740 --> 12:37.220
thousands of them. We asked him if he had an area of concentration in his
collecting. Well, I once gave a talk on this subject, and I titled it The

12:37.220 --> 12:50.560
Complete Science Fiction Collector, Confessions of a Pack Rat. In other words,
I'm very, very versatile and dabbling in my tastes. I don't like all kinds of

12:50.560 --> 13:02.240
things equally, but I collect anything that's published in the science fiction
and fantasy vein, I get my hands on, and then I can afford. Which means almost,

13:02.380 --> 13:13.820
I've got copies of almost every book that's been published. Why does John Marks
collect science fiction books? What's the fascination? Because it's there? Sure.

13:15.000 --> 13:23.200
That's actually, I suppose, a difficult question for anyone to answer. First of
all, you have to love books, or whatever you're collecting. I mean, this is the

13:23.200 --> 13:36.980
collector's mania. There's lots of people that collect anything from matchbooks
to old Avon bottles, for heaven's sakes. And I collect what I enjoy from other

13:36.980 --> 13:47.760
standpoints. I enjoy the artwork on them. I enjoy reading the things. I like to
read at least a representative book by any author that's important in the field,

13:47.780 --> 13:58.680
and so on. And I just love books. I love to handle them. I love to sort them,
catalog them, put them away, just look at them. And that's what I do with a fair

13:58.680 --> 14:09.240
portion of my spare time, I guess. But why collect science fiction books? Why
not coins or stamps or seashells? Because I love science fiction. Something we

14:09.240 --> 14:22.300
haven't gotten into the conversation yet is, here at Texas Tech, I also am
involved in helping the team teach the course in science fiction. We have a

14:22.300 --> 14:33.020
special course through our honors program, and there are three or four of us
every semester team teach this thing to a small group, and we try to teach them

14:33.020 --> 14:41.740
principles about writing also, so it's a creative writing course, very much a
discussion course, and so on. But I just love science fiction. I don't mind

14:41.740 --> 14:50.440
reading an occasional mystery, let's say. I haven't read a Western in 20 years,
but I've read lots of science fiction. Since that's what I like to read, that's

14:50.440 --> 15:00.980
what I like to collect. Also, I might say that many of the older science fiction
books are more valuable to collectors in general than many of those in other

15:00.980 --> 15:12.300
fields of, say, comparable age and publisher. We asked Marks which part of his
collection he's most proud of. My pulp magazines, I think, is sort of my own

15:12.300 --> 15:21.620
favorite among all the things. You know, people come into the house, visitors
that know nothing about science fiction, and I always trot them downstairs and

15:21.620 --> 15:31.860
show them the collection. Kind of funny to watch somebody, you hand them one of
those old pulp magazines, give them one that isn't crumbling too badly, and then

15:31.860 --> 15:39.960
they start looking at all the old ads from the 30s or whatever. It's kind of a
history lesson just to go through the things if they don't know the stories or

15:39.960 --> 15:50.300
care about that especially, why they find the ads more fascinating than
anything. But I started out in the terms of serious collecting with the

15:50.300 --> 16:01.760
magazines and the pulp especially, and those early ones especially are, there
just aren't very many copies around, and so that's kind of my favorite part of

16:01.760 --> 16:13.180
the collection. Would he sell his collection for a high enough price? Probably
not now. I do know somebody who retired and took a round-the-world trip on

16:13.180 --> 16:21.440
selling his. In the area John Marks concentrates on, paperbacks, pulps, and
magazines, he doubts there are many collections in the country except for

16:21.440 --> 16:22.660
libraries that surpass his.

16:29.700 --> 16:37.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:37.640 --> 16:42.520
Odessa, Texas.

16:45.740 --> 16:46.500


16:51.120 --> 16:51.760


16:56.960 --> 16:58.380


17:36.620 --> 17:39.420


17:52.420 --> 17:55.460
A commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:58.220 --> 17:59.860
And here are your hosts.

18:03.880 --> 18:11.940
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Bob Wayne owns a specialty bookstore in
Fort Worth, Texas called Fantastic Worlds. He sells almost anything related to

18:11.940 --> 18:18.840
science fiction or fantasy, including comics, gaming paraphernalia, and video
material. He is also a collector, principally of comics and hardback science

18:18.840 --> 18:26.100
fiction books. We spoke with him recently about his hardback collection. Just
asking questions a curious non-collector might think of. What, for instance,

18:26.260 --> 18:36.660
does he consider the ultimate for a hardback collector of science fiction? Well,
among the ultimate items to find in the hardcover field are some of the double

18:36.660 --> 18:48.340
-day hardcover books of recent years that had very small printings and, for one
reason or another, had very small distribution. Two that come to mind are Roger

18:48.340 --> 19:01.480
Zelazny's Nine Princes in Amber and Philip Jose Farmer's Flesh. And I would
be in the position of passing apocryphal, potentially, stories about why these

19:01.480 --> 19:11.680
books are in slow editions or small editions. But my understanding is that both
of these books were remaindered very quickly upon publication and had very

19:11.680 --> 19:27.180
little distribution outside of review copies and library copies. So those books
are both hard to find. I've only seen two copies of either of those books in the

19:27.180 --> 19:36.900
time that I've been collecting books and looking at hardcovers. It's about 69.
We also asked him if he ever made any accidental finds, any nuggets that he

19:36.900 --> 19:47.740
hadn't been expecting. I've had a number of strokes of what I would have to
consider luck as far as finding books that I consider to be quite valuable. I

19:47.740 --> 19:58.580
was at a book fair at one time with Louis Shiner, a short story writer who's
appeared in Omni and Cheyall and various magazines. And we were just looking

19:58.580 --> 20:09.540
through tons and tons of hardcover books, miles and miles of historical
romances. And we were giving up. And over in a little bitty pile on the side,

20:09.640 --> 20:18.380
there was a little bitty book. A little bit was sticking out. It looked
familiar. And it was a Gnome Press book written by Henry Kuttner under the name

20:18.380 --> 20:28.640
of Louis Paget called Robots Have No Tails that was in perfect condition. And
they had priced it at what I thought was the outrageous price of 40 cents. But I

20:28.640 --> 20:40.320
went on ahead and paid the 40 cents. That was a tough blow to pay that much
money for a book worth just, you know, 100, 200 times more than that. But I was

20:40.320 --> 20:51.520
able to tear loose the money. We wondered if there was any part of his
collection he's most proud of. I would have to say that there's not really any

20:51.520 --> 21:07.800
one item that I'm most proud of as far as being difficult to find. And I do have
a one-of-a-kind item in my collection that I purchased at an auction this last

21:07.800 --> 21:20.220
summer. It's a translation from the French of the book, Philip Jose Farmer
Conquers the Universe, that Philip Jose Farmer donated to an auction at a

21:20.220 --> 21:28.060
convention that my store sponsored in Dallas during the summer. And that has a
cover letter and it's signed by Philip Jose Farmer and a copy of the book in

21:28.060 --> 21:35.900
French that it was translated from. And it's a translation that the publisher
who has the option on this book, Berkley Books, has decided that they did not

21:35.900 --> 21:46.780
want to publish in that form. So that will be the only version of that in
English. So I suppose as far as a rarity, having the only copy floating around

21:46.780 --> 21:55.600
of that should be a novelty to some extent. Collecting in the science fiction
field is becoming a popular hobby among science fiction and fantasy fans. Fans

21:55.600 --> 22:03.500
will collect anything, too. Books, magazines, comics, movie memorabilia,
artwork, and so on. If you're interested, Bob Wayne can help you out with advice

22:03.500 --> 22:07.200
or material. Just contact the Fantastic Worlds Bookstore in Fort Worth, Texas.

22:14.560 --> 22:22.360
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:22.360 --> 22:23.100
Odessa, Texas.

22:54.640 --> 22:54.980


23:08.680 --> 23:14.160


23:28.100 --> 23:33.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:36.060 --> 23:37.780
And here are your hosts.

23:41.880 --> 23:49.540
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. Older readers and fans of science fiction
may be bewildered at what's happened to their field today. Science fiction is

23:49.540 --> 23:56.940
not found only in books and movies anymore. It's spilled over into role-playing
games like Dungeons & Dragons and into numerous video games for home television

23:56.940 --> 24:04.300
and computers. The market for materials related to these games is tremendous,
but so is the market for traditional science fiction books and magazines. Bob

24:04.300 --> 24:11.360
Wayne, owner of Fantastic Worlds Bookstore in Fort Worth, Texas, supplies
customers in both areas. We asked him to tell us about Fantastic Worlds.

24:12.480 --> 24:23.900
Fantastic Worlds Bookstore, the store that I own, started off, you know, two and
a half years ago. And we specialize in items of the fantastic. We have comic

24:23.900 --> 24:33.440
books, science fiction books, fantasy role-playing games, video games, and
science fiction movies on videotape. And all the other paraphernalia that you

24:33.440 --> 24:43.060
would expect in relation to those items. For example, lead miniatures for role
-playing games or dice. We have comics, bags to put comics in, boxes, posters,

24:43.340 --> 24:55.980
portfolios, movie posters. Just an assortment of things, you know, related. We
go all the way from talking animals like Garfield to Superman to Doctor Who and

24:55.980 --> 25:05.500
to Felix the Cat. Just a wide variety of things. All, the only common element is
that they're all science fiction, fantasy concepts to some extent.

25:14.860 --> 25:23.360
Wayne also collects both comics and science fiction hardbacks. We asked him to
tell us how he began his collection. The way I got started in collecting is

25:23.360 --> 25:35.260
actually the way I got started in reading. My paternal grandfather was a bus
driver. He used to pick up comic books that people left on the bus and bring

25:35.260 --> 25:43.060
them, you know, and I would get them from him. So I learned how to read when I
was about five years old by reading comic books that were left on buses. So

25:43.060 --> 25:55.600
everyone who rode on a bus through much of Texas in 1959, 1958, 1960, you know,
I'm in their debt for being able to read from an early age and for my love of

25:55.600 --> 26:05.660
comics and science fiction. And I went from that to keeping the comics that I
had read and putting them on a little shelf in my closet. And from that point,

26:05.720 --> 26:15.780
it began to snowball where, you know, I began picking up anything that I felt
was related to comics. And then I eventually got into science fiction reading

26:15.780 --> 26:25.080
when I met Fritz Leiber at a convention in 1968. Wayne says his collection led
into his becoming the founder and proprietor of Fantastic Worlds. He tells us

26:25.080 --> 26:36.780
how that happened. At one point, you know, I noticed that my personal taste in
comic books, the ones that I felt were the superior examples of comic books as

26:36.780 --> 26:47.460
an art, and the ones that seemed to be increasing in value on the collector's
market, had a lot in common. And I began to feel that there was the potential

26:47.460 --> 26:55.360
that if I picked up a couple of extra copies of the ones that I felt were really
good comics, that they would appreciate in value faster than just going in and

26:55.360 --> 27:06.660
buying a handful at random. And so I began to speculate in comic books by buying
them on the hope that someone would come along later and want to pay me more

27:06.660 --> 27:16.640
money for them than I had paid for them myself. And then I began to do the same
thing with science fiction books, but on the smaller margin. I began buying

27:16.640 --> 27:26.720
books from England, which were not generally available in this country in the
late 70s, and taking them to conventions and selling those. And I kept sending

27:26.720 --> 27:37.260
aside more and more extra comics and more and more books. And I realized that I
had to either buy myself a larger house to store all this stuff in than I was

27:37.260 --> 27:46.860
only using a couple of times a year, or going ahead and open a store for
retailing. I chose to open a store, you know, because this has much more tax

27:46.860 --> 27:49.280
advantages to owning a house just to store books in.

27:56.720 --> 28:04.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

28:04.560 --> 28:05.320
Odessa, Texas.
