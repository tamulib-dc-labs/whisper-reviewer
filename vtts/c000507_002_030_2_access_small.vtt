00:01.340 --> 00:05.880
You mentioned your, this isn't really a question, it's on, the tape is rolling, but you mentioned

00:05.880 --> 00:08.320
your dad gave you all those ace doubles when you were a kid.

00:08.500 --> 00:14.420
I'm a collector, I just threw blood, sweat and tears and finished my ace double collection.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.760
Do you still have it?

00:15.980 --> 00:17.720
Do you still collect books and that sort of thing?

00:17.720 --> 00:31.420
No, the practiccounties of career or such, I don't collect unfortunately or fortunately

00:32.030 --> 00:39.420
much of anything now because we're in the disposable society and unfortunately I've

00:39.420 --> 00:40.960
become a victim to that.

00:40.960 --> 00:51.980
But I'm just racing around so much, the trip to England in October, I live a good 45

00:51.980 --> 00:58.200
minutes to an hour drive from where I do most of my interviews in Hollywood and Invirons

00:58.200 --> 01:05.200
and so I'm racing around too much to collect and then I'm trying to get out every so often

01:05.200 --> 01:11.300
and see movies, maybe review a movie now and then to collect means to take up space

01:12.140 --> 01:19.780
and I have so much space taken up with interviews that I've done on tape with biographies that

01:19.780 --> 01:23.860
I have to read that they're just to put it colloquially now, there ain't enough room.

01:25.620 --> 01:31.100
Yeah, I think I understand, I haven't had to make the switch yet to throwing away my

01:31.100 --> 01:32.540
collection, I hope I don't have to.

01:33.500 --> 01:39.260
And I'm not, I tend to, oh, this is part of the interview, fine.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.640
Yeah, I know for sure.

01:41.140 --> 01:42.020
Is it on tape?

01:42.500 --> 01:44.780
This is on tape, we can shut it off if you want.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.900
No, no, this is fine, use whatever you want.

01:47.660 --> 01:56.600
In some ways I guess I tend to be materialistic but I look at maybe collecting unless one

01:56.600 --> 02:05.740
does it for investment reasons as a cumulative materialism whereby materialism, oh, how do

02:05.740 --> 02:10.080
we put it, you buy a television, you keep it for a year, maybe you get tired of it,

02:10.100 --> 02:13.220
you want a bigger television, you dispose of the previous television.

02:13.500 --> 02:18.360
But when you're collecting things you keep what you have before and add to it and I'm

02:18.360 --> 02:20.180
just not oriented that way.

02:22.060 --> 02:29.460
I'm interested in cars, I've had, could have had 40 cars in 14 years but I don't have all

02:29.460 --> 02:30.940
40 cars yet with me.

02:33.380 --> 02:38.540
Maybe your wisdom will rub off on me, yes I do have all these books.

02:39.240 --> 02:47.460
You used the word wisdom, I think there's a certain comfort in collecting.

02:47.460 --> 02:55.660
If I were a smoker, which I am not, I would, let's say I smoked pipes, I would probably

02:55.660 --> 03:02.280
find a great deal of satisfaction in using pipes that I'd gotten maybe 10 years before

03:02.280 --> 03:10.120
and maybe I was in Paris and I got this pipe in a special little store just off of Champs-les-Été

03:10.120 --> 03:12.740
and that would bring back memories.

03:12.740 --> 03:20.240
That kind of collecting might be nice but I'm living new things all the time and I don't

03:20.240 --> 03:24.700
really have time necessarily to rehash a lot of memories, although they can be very nice.

03:25.460 --> 03:30.620
I have some friends for example who, well and this is not again a plug for the magazine,

03:30.840 --> 03:36.380
but if I were a collector, let me rephrase that, to be a collector I'd have to have the

03:36.380 --> 03:43.120
room for it and some friends of mine have taken over it where Valentino's oldest state,

03:44.120 --> 03:52.740
Falkenslayer, it has 10 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, it's on 4 and a half acres of ground right

03:52.740 --> 03:57.080
in the middle of Beverly Hills, I couldn't afford the taxes on the thing but it's such

03:57.080 --> 04:02.420
a beautiful house, they've refurbished it, they collect and they also sell antiques.

04:02.420 --> 04:07.180
That house has a million dollars worth of antiques in it and I could see what that would

04:07.180 --> 04:14.080
be very pleasant because an antique is something that can be shown that adds beauty to a room

04:14.520 --> 04:19.880
and is also a good investment and I think I could probably, if I had the money, which

04:19.880 --> 04:23.880
I don't, tip over in that direction but not much else.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.160
Okay, back to the real world now I guess.

04:31.040 --> 04:37.180
This may be a difficult question and one way to answer because you are more or less out

04:37.180 --> 04:41.780
of science fiction but I will ask it first of all about the printed word science fiction

04:41.780 --> 04:45.440
then I'll ask it about the movies but where do you see science fiction going?

04:45.680 --> 04:50.180
You were involved in it for so many years, you went through the new wave and did a lot

04:50.180 --> 04:53.900
of editing on the tail end of that, where is it going now in your opinion?

04:54.600 --> 05:03.860
Well I think by virtue of Spielberg and Lucas in their areas of science fiction their taste

05:03.860 --> 05:12.380
being assimilated by people who see their movies and then those tastes are guided, guide what

05:12.380 --> 05:20.420
they buy, I think it's definitely going in the more traditional, the more space adventure

05:21.020 --> 05:24.720
and in the case of AT the more poignant science fiction.

05:25.160 --> 05:32.060
I think for example, Edgar Pangborn and what a wonderful writer he was did a classic science

05:32.060 --> 05:37.300
fiction book called Mirror for Observers and that has some of the most poetic, beautiful,

05:38.260 --> 05:45.000
moving, poignant science fiction writing that I've ever read in science fiction and some of the

05:45.000 --> 05:50.980
best writing I've ever read in any genre or even out of the genres and I would like to think that

05:50.980 --> 05:58.720
science fiction is definitely moving in that direction and let's face it, Star Wars, Empire

05:58.720 --> 06:08.820
Strikes Back, ET and Close Encounters obviously not in that order of release have made pretty close

06:08.820 --> 06:18.320
to worldwide now, golly, nudging a billion dollars at movie theaters and the spin-off,

06:18.660 --> 06:26.200
the paperback books have earned also an incredible amount of money now. Why are people going in that

06:26.200 --> 06:30.880
direction? They're going in that direction because they're not paying their money to see a movie that

06:30.880 --> 06:36.560
they hope to dislike, they're paying their money to see a movie that they hope to like and by the way

06:36.560 --> 06:43.560
the only reason those movies are succeeding is not because 200 million people have seen the movies,

06:43.940 --> 06:49.420
it's because maybe 50 million people have seen the movies and half of those people are seeing

06:49.420 --> 06:55.760
those movies two and three and four and sometimes seven, eight and ten times. The movie business I hit,

06:56.340 --> 07:04.560
a real out-of-the-ball park home run is based upon people going back to the theater and seeing the

07:04.560 --> 07:12.260
film again and again. Otherwise if you'd had only first time, only time viewers, ET would not have

07:12.260 --> 07:17.280
grossed according to the latest figures over 200 million dollars in this country alone.

07:19.540 --> 07:31.400
I keep using the word phase I realize. It's etched in my brain. In your opinion,

07:32.900 --> 07:38.840
is the spate of the science fiction movies the ones that you've mentioned, is that a phase in five

07:38.840 --> 07:45.600
years, ten years from now? Are we going to be going to some other genre movies that are going to be the

07:45.600 --> 07:49.040
current crazer? Do you think this is something that may stay with us for a while?

07:49.380 --> 07:51.200
When was Star Wars first released?

07:51.220 --> 07:52.640
That was 77.

07:53.480 --> 07:59.480
They asked the same question in the midst of that and it's been five years later. How much longer

07:59.480 --> 08:05.840
do we ask the same question? Next year we have a 1983, we have a revenge in the Jedi out. The second

08:05.840 --> 08:16.020
sequel to Star Wars, the third one in that series. Will that continue the cycle? Perhaps I think you

08:16.020 --> 08:23.740
have a phase when you have movies such as X-Caliber and Conan the Conqueror and as of the day to this

08:23.740 --> 08:29.880
interview, the forthcoming Beastmaster, you have a phase there that seems to give the impression

08:29.880 --> 08:34.820
that it's going to be nothing more than a phase, that a year or two it'll die out. X-Caliber made a

08:34.820 --> 08:42.800
lot of money. Conan made a lot of money initially but after the first couple of weeks or so and word of

08:42.800 --> 08:51.060
mouth got around about really what an atrocious picture it was, the drop-off in business from one

08:51.060 --> 08:57.160
week to the next was like 42, even 50 percent, maybe as low as 30 percent. So as soon as word of

08:57.160 --> 09:04.560
mouth got around the pictures died. Now I see that genre of sword and sorcery and so on being a phase.

09:05.180 --> 09:12.020
But what we're dealing with here is a brand of science fiction, a process science fiction that has

09:12.020 --> 09:19.120
actually been around 60 years for Pete's sake. Look again at Gernsback, look again at John W.

09:19.340 --> 09:25.860
Campbell. So if it's a phase I think it's going to be a pretty long-lived one. Yeah, it's a trend more

09:25.860 --> 09:32.160
than a phase. As far as I was concerned Star Wars with the exception of the the princess, now she

09:32.160 --> 09:37.480
wasn't a wallflower but otherwise it could have come straight out of the 20s or 30s. Yeah, oh totally,

09:37.720 --> 09:43.660
totally. So I think we're also in the midst I'm told of something of a nostalgia boom so maybe that

09:43.660 --> 09:49.140
fits in as well. I don't know. One thing that brought to mind when you were talking I find it

09:49.140 --> 09:56.160
ironic that in the written word fantasy is is outselling science fiction there are more fantasy

09:56.160 --> 10:00.360
titles than there are new science fiction titles. It's not in the movie field. Exactly, it's the

10:00.360 --> 10:07.760
opposite and the fantasy doesn't quite cut it for some reason. We know why I think in a novel we

10:07.760 --> 10:14.140
create the world in our minds through the the implements as it were the author's words. He helps

10:14.140 --> 10:21.480
as he gets started in that world but our minds fill in the gaps and in the movies it is such a

10:21.480 --> 10:28.540
literal view our minds can't fill in any of the gaps and the visions that have thus far been up on

10:28.540 --> 10:34.840
the screen have been imperfect and we don't have anything left to our imagination anymore.

10:38.600 --> 10:48.040
Does that make sense? Yeah, I like that. If I analyze it I think that's right. Conan just didn't

10:48.040 --> 10:55.140
quite cut it in the from the fantastic part the spirits the thing I really walked out in the

10:55.140 --> 11:05.000
film because what they did was they some of my prejudices are showing. It was so sexually

11:05.000 --> 11:11.380
explicit that scene by the fireplace where the woman turns into a witch and all or maybe she's a

11:11.380 --> 11:15.880
witch and I forget was she turned into a snake or a bird or whatever it was I tried to forget as

11:15.880 --> 11:24.580
I mean there they the movies today feel that unless they have a sexually explicit scene and you

11:24.580 --> 11:29.660
know I can prove this movie after movie after movie the world according to Garp for example which

11:29.660 --> 11:39.700
was a real disaster and some others and yet there's I remember so many people Fred Polan

11:39.700 --> 11:47.240
others telling me that to just stick in a sex scene in a science fiction film or or book just

11:47.240 --> 11:51.620
seems supposedly out of place because for so many years the genre didn't have any of that.

11:56.460 --> 12:07.660
Right. Okay I'm about at the end of my my questions that I've asked I was gonna come

12:07.660 --> 12:14.820
into you really like Edgar Pangborn and I don't I do too and I spider Robinson's editorializing

12:14.820 --> 12:19.520
few years ago turned me on to him and I really like him but very few people have ever heard of

12:19.520 --> 12:26.020
that. That's interesting yes they've heard of Clark they've heard of Asimov they've heard of Bradbury

12:26.020 --> 12:31.100
and so on but they haven't heard of Edgar Pangborn but I really I mean mirror for observers

12:31.100 --> 12:38.300
especially that beautiful last paragraph it was prose poetry for Pete Sack so much as science

12:38.300 --> 12:48.500
fiction is either quirky or nuts and bolts that I just I respond my own personal taste again or

12:48.500 --> 12:55.300
toward poetry and writing I try to have my own writing as poetic as possible whenever I can it's

12:55.300 --> 13:01.900
interesting I've interviewed movie stars and others and I've been interviewing them for so many

13:01.900 --> 13:09.880
years and I interviewed one of the kids on fame Lee Carriere the white kid who has the kind of the

13:09.880 --> 13:15.660
afro haircut nice kid so I interviewed him and somebody else had interviewed him and said oh

13:15.660 --> 13:20.900
he's so dull I mean ah how can you ever get an interview out of him so I went and interviewed him

13:20.900 --> 13:26.060
and I found them really terrific because he's quote if you will an intellectual sort of person

13:26.060 --> 13:32.500
and I probed that I didn't go the fan magazine route of well you know who's your girlfriend what's

13:32.500 --> 13:37.220
your favorite color what did you have for breakfast all that nonsense which you could find in any

13:37.220 --> 13:43.620
good biography anyway so why waste the person's time and your time so what I did was I probed the

13:43.620 --> 13:49.120
mind and the heart and the soul of the kid if I may refer to him as a kid he's about 22 years old

13:49.120 --> 13:56.200
compared to 40 years old he's a kid that's we said with respect anyway and I did an article based

13:56.200 --> 14:01.540
upon the interview sometimes I do Q&A which is kind of a routine way of doing it but if the interview

14:01.540 --> 14:07.140
is good enough it works but in this case the interview worked but I also wanted to add some

14:07.140 --> 14:16.140
my own insight into it and I ended up with a final paragraph let me see if I can find it hold on a

14:16.140 --> 14:16.400
second

14:31.040 --> 14:36.740
representative found it I hope this doesn't come off as corny I mean I may check it out and not read

14:37.300 --> 14:39.900
all right we don't we won't have to use it on anything

14:39.900 --> 14:44.680
oh my goodness

14:44.680 --> 14:59.440
oh I'd like to see her

14:59.440 --> 15:09.220
she is so nice I oh here it is okay by the way I also interviewed Rod Steiger and he's a prince too

15:11.140 --> 15:19.340
okay well corny or not here we go final paragraph my editorial comments not a quote

15:20.280 --> 15:26.260
when he was much younger Lee reached out plenty of times tentatively investigating the cardores of

15:26.260 --> 15:32.960
his mind and wanting to communicate his findings to his peers only to be rebuffed repeatedly

15:32.960 --> 15:39.920
that is no longer the case he has emerged from a kind of denny twisted battered and isolated cocoon

15:39.920 --> 15:46.440
in which he once had been entrapped the comparison is valid you know a caterpillar can only crawl

15:46.440 --> 15:52.740
susceptible to being stepped on by careless speed or sprayed with poisons but a butterfly is free

15:52.740 --> 15:59.320
it can soar it can reach up one could fantasize to the sky and beyond even to the gates of heaven

16:00.820 --> 16:10.480
well you know we're dealing with oh essentially quick journalism we're dealing with a short article

16:10.480 --> 16:17.400
we're not dealing with great art but what I try to do with my articles and the people I interview in

16:17.400 --> 16:23.640
that whole scene is not going there and hit on well I think I can summarize it this way

16:23.640 --> 16:29.120
Shirley Jones told me at a two-hour interview with her that was more like a conversation

16:29.120 --> 16:35.380
conversation keyword with a friend second keyword than an interrogation by a journalist

16:36.480 --> 16:41.240
and and I don't think just because you're doing an article on a film star that it should be

16:41.240 --> 16:47.940
kind of a seedy opportunistic article there should be an attempt whether it succeeds or

16:47.940 --> 16:54.380
fails is almost unimportant there should be an attempt to do something hopefully a little bit

16:54.380 --> 17:01.140
better hopefully a little bit more poignant but at least not predictable and not salacious in the

17:01.140 --> 17:08.000
sense of say the national inquirer all right yeah I imagine it's pretty hard to do oh it is and you

17:08.000 --> 17:14.040
don't want to force it it has to be natural so there's some ways that I handle articles for

17:14.040 --> 17:19.520
example and strictly the q&a format I did an interview of Cliff Robertson and of course some years

17:19.520 --> 17:24.500
ago four or five years ago he was involved in the business with David Bigelman the movie tycoon

17:24.500 --> 17:30.000
and the forgery thing and so forth I did that strictly as q&a because there what people were

17:30.000 --> 17:37.160
interested in reading about is what Cliff went through not what I might be able to interpolate

17:37.160 --> 17:45.540
into it so strictly q&a are the stars uh all I've ever interviewed is science fiction writers

17:45.540 --> 17:51.960
generally they're they're cerebral um science fiction right yes generally they are pretty well

17:51.960 --> 17:57.040
spoken although not all of them they may not have great voices or anything but they can express their

17:57.040 --> 18:03.460
ideas well are the stars um as bright a lot or as they are some of them uh you know kind of dumb I

18:03.460 --> 18:08.100
get the impression that there are some of them well I just don't understand the artistic talent

18:08.100 --> 18:13.180
really that sort of thing so I probably have a bad opinion of them but they don't seem too bright a

18:13.180 --> 18:20.500
lot well all right what what is the what are we actually saying there is something endemic

18:21.240 --> 18:30.600
to acting that draws stupid people or that I'm very prejudiced I think that's probably what it is

18:30.960 --> 18:35.740
that that is my question is that what we are saying if we are not saying that

18:36.500 --> 18:44.680
then the answer would be that there are no more stupid people or or empty or superficial people

18:44.680 --> 18:51.960
in this business than there are in any other what happens is let's put it this way and I think

18:52.680 --> 18:56.120
that I may suspiciously come close to patting myself in the back for a moment

18:56.560 --> 19:01.840
is that the average journalist and there are exceptions golly a number of exceptions but

19:01.840 --> 19:11.360
the average journalist will consider an interview with a star strictly as a job to be done in the

19:11.360 --> 19:19.080
course of business as in doing a newspaper and and they know know insult or sarcasm intended

19:19.080 --> 19:26.800
that they will not have an opinion of a star prior to the interview and they'll let that

19:26.800 --> 19:34.840
guide them during the interview any more interesting than the one you have no they will think as you

19:34.840 --> 19:42.840
do as you surmise that a star may be dumber than the rest of us so they ask dumb questions

19:44.200 --> 19:52.820
and the star will respond maybe dumbly what I try to do is not ask questions even at all

19:52.820 --> 19:58.000
although I ask questions because if you simply ask questions you are conducting an interview

19:58.000 --> 20:05.580
what I am doing with when I interview a star is to do a as to engage in a conversation let me try

20:05.580 --> 20:12.220
this on you that try my little pet theory this occurred to me generally the people I associate

20:12.220 --> 20:19.000
with the people I interview are I guess are left hemisphere people there that sort of thing whereas

20:19.000 --> 20:25.360
that I would the artistic talent is generally associated with the right hemisphere and more

20:25.360 --> 20:38.540
with creativity and that sort of thing maybe that's where my problem is science fiction writers are

20:39.600 --> 20:47.120
creative artistic out of the technical practical side of their head and movie stars are probably

20:47.120 --> 20:54.500
more creative out of the artistic side of their head I'm not a psychologist that's my layman's

20:54.500 --> 21:06.180
guess well let me let me give you I was just looking through something here while you were

21:06.180 --> 21:13.280
not great art but here's something that that red steiger said get it going back to what I said

21:13.280 --> 21:20.020
before he continued interrupting his own silence my thoughts quote pain has been my teacher but it

21:20.020 --> 21:27.280
is also a teacher that must be understood life is not a gift life is not a joy it is a battle when

21:27.280 --> 21:33.480
it lacks compassion it is an adventurous conflict when it has compassion when you realize that there

21:33.480 --> 21:38.120
has to be a certain amount of pain in the life you're leading and you accept this and when you

21:38.120 --> 21:43.280
accept it with intelligence and understand that every other human being has the same or similar

21:43.280 --> 21:49.500
burdens then the poetic quality that makes life soar can come in the being steiger stood stretching

21:49.500 --> 21:53.980
his legs he looked outside at the ways that were breaking the shore a few hundred feet from his

21:53.980 --> 22:00.120
malibu house then he turned and sat down again his eyes and 10 I mean I say to myself about myself

22:00.120 --> 22:07.320
good lord look at this curious piece called man man who knows that it's going to be a pain in the

22:07.320 --> 22:14.020
ass day but somehow we'll get through it and somehow we'll survive I'm amazed how many of us insist

22:14.020 --> 22:20.740
upon survival on stumbling forward I mean just insist upon this and then magically wonderously

22:20.740 --> 22:27.480
our fears enable us to discover beauty in our existence yes our fears fuel beauty and that can

22:27.480 --> 22:34.720
be a desire to survive at more than just an animalistic level to survive with courage with a measure

22:34.720 --> 22:44.180
of purpose that is beauty indeed now okay but not cheap interview material that's not my favorite

22:44.180 --> 22:54.320
color is red I had two eggs for breakfast or well I'm sleeping with so-and-so or whatever that is not

22:54.320 --> 22:59.460
it's not great art it can't be considered great writing or maybe even great interviewing

22:59.880 --> 23:06.260
but I think it's a cut above the national inquire well it obviously comes from his heart yes and um

23:06.860 --> 23:15.220
yeah I like that enough as the engineer said there are some exceptions yes and this I told him uh you

23:15.760 --> 23:20.880
speak extemporaneously as I hope to write after three drafts

23:24.320 --> 23:32.560
yeah I can believe it after what we just heard yep and then there are other people there are the

23:33.120 --> 23:42.960
giddy superficial quote starlet types but I got so mad well only insane people get mad

23:43.820 --> 23:51.900
uh I got so angry at a writer who wanted to write for my magazine and I won't name him for obvious

23:51.900 --> 23:58.140
reasons uh one of a friend of mine and I used a friend the word friend in this case in quotes

23:58.140 --> 24:04.340
he's more than the acquaintance but not an intimate friend but I used a friend in quotes okay a friend

24:04.340 --> 24:10.340
of mine is Scott Bayo who was on the happy day series for some years and then is now spun off into

24:10.340 --> 24:16.320
a separate series which he stars in called Junie Los Marchi he's gotten a lot of play as a teen

24:16.320 --> 24:22.640
idol type but I know him and I know his father Mario and the guy's a good kid he's uh he's got a

24:22.640 --> 24:29.380
lot of a lot of talent as an actor maybe a little less talent as a singer but that's developing too

24:29.380 --> 24:34.580
and a good individual an interesting person to interview and I just plain like him there's one

24:34.580 --> 24:41.020
writer who had been recommended to me I called him interested in having him write for me because he

24:41.020 --> 24:46.280
said that he was going to interview Scott Bayo and I've interviewed Scott enough that sometimes

24:46.280 --> 24:51.000
you want to hold off for a bit and get a new perspective and maybe have somebody else do it

24:51.000 --> 24:55.960
so I said well yeah fine I know him if you have any trouble getting in touch with him let me know

24:55.960 --> 25:00.520
but yeah why don't you consider writing a story or doing an interview and writing a story on Scott

25:01.160 --> 25:11.560
and uh he said yeah he said uh this this guy who is a teen idol who um is uh

25:12.540 --> 25:20.120
capitalizing on his teen idol success to cut a record or two uh he's really trying to rip off

25:20.120 --> 25:27.100
his fans and I said hold it wait a minute how do you know he says well that's what I think I said

25:27.100 --> 25:31.300
all right what do you base that upon have you ever interviewed him before and he said no

25:31.300 --> 25:37.980
I said how much have you studied what's inside his mind he said I I really haven't done that I

25:37.980 --> 25:43.660
read an article or two I said was that subject ever discussed he said no I said so you mean to tell me

25:43.660 --> 25:51.740
you're going into an interview with somebody with that kind of mindset at the beginning and and that's

25:51.740 --> 25:57.540
going to guide every one of your questions I said talk about predetering your case or his case or

25:57.540 --> 26:03.000
whatever I said I think that's canvas you will not write for us he said well do you want to publish

26:03.000 --> 26:09.080
have them then and I said all right it is just as dishonest it's it's well let me rephrase it

26:09.080 --> 26:16.660
it is dishonest to go into an interview with that perspective in mind based upon nothing but a kind of

26:17.460 --> 26:24.540
superficial impression that any interview can be twisted and shaped according to virtually any

26:24.540 --> 26:30.660
point of view if you want to do it that way it's it's not hard but are you interested in doing an

26:30.660 --> 26:35.780
interview according to a preconception of yours or you're interested in finding the truth because

26:35.780 --> 26:42.740
if you go into it with that hard-nosed and attitude you'll disregard the truth and and have that angle

26:42.740 --> 26:46.380
become a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy so that writer will never write for me

26:48.680 --> 26:57.860
very interesting let me uh by the way is it possible if I may I'd love to get if it's not too

26:57.860 --> 27:03.760
bloody expensive for you a copy of the whole interview and also a copy of the edited down one

27:03.760 --> 27:08.960
is that possible not for approval I hasten that no no that's very possible it takes us

27:08.960 --> 27:15.580
what three minutes to make a copy oh good okay um let me get your drink I think you gave it to me

27:15.580 --> 27:27.660
in Dallas but I better get it just fine 29438 promontory that's PROMONT ORY place uh it's a

27:27.660 --> 27:38.940
kora h-e-o-u-r-a california 91301 91301 okay fantastic oh yeah we'll get you a copy uh

27:38.940 --> 27:45.960
a bow version yeah no problem tell you what the we'll get you the original uh real quick

27:45.960 --> 27:52.000
the edited version good while let me ask you you'd mentioned a little bit when I talked to you in

27:52.000 --> 27:57.680
Dallas that you know some people and that sort of thing we have some people in our radio show

27:57.680 --> 28:04.400
that are really interested in the movies in that aspect and we okay the science fiction movies

28:05.560 --> 28:10.420
talk you know people who who produce them that sort of thing and you gave us the name of glenn

28:10.420 --> 28:15.580
camble with disney studios before yeah would it be possible for us to talk to you every once in a

28:15.580 --> 28:20.900
while and just uh see if you know somebody that's involved with this movie or that movie oh absolutely

28:20.900 --> 28:25.580
call me anytime and if I don't know I can suggest somebody who doesn't know and if I don't even know

28:25.580 --> 28:31.000
that I'll tell you great okay that's that's what we need we sure appreciate getting the chance to

28:31.000 --> 28:37.060
talk to you did make any sense this interview is this yes I'm so used to doing my own that uh

28:37.680 --> 28:42.800
I'm not sure how this turns out from your point oh I think it turned out great of course from the

28:42.800 --> 28:48.380
for the radio show we will we will concentrate more on the laser books and in the editing that

28:48.380 --> 28:54.920
sort of thing but uh it's just interesting to get into uh somebody else's mindset and uh

28:54.920 --> 28:59.780
it's it's very good for me especially to talk to another interviewer one that's got a lot more

28:59.780 --> 29:05.980
experience and how do I come off frankly if you were putting on the whole thing which you're not

29:05.980 --> 29:10.900
we know that because there's not a good time but if you were broadcasting the whole thing edited to

29:10.900 --> 29:18.600
eliminate the hems and the hams and so on how how how would I come off you come off as positive

29:18.600 --> 29:27.980
confident very on excruciatingly honest um very bright and uh humorous is this part on tape too

29:27.980 --> 29:35.020
this is this is on tape that part I like that okay tell you next next book right parents who have had

29:35.020 --> 29:39.440
some doubts about that part of that I talked to your dad one night I had a good conversation

29:39.440 --> 29:46.920
with him the terrific people they live with you well yes they do I know I was going to rephrase

29:46.920 --> 29:51.600
that somewhat self-defensively but you put it properly okay well great that's somebody to watch

29:51.600 --> 29:58.240
the house when you're in england and all those oh no no uh actually uh oh you might be interested

29:58.240 --> 30:04.920
now that I'm have you seen the preview to Beastmaster yes on the tube not in a movie but on the tube

30:04.920 --> 30:10.520
well the one I saw which was actually the preview was better than the whole movie world according to

30:10.520 --> 30:18.020
garb which is one of the world's worst uh the preview has got to be one of the most energetic

30:19.520 --> 30:24.680
interesting exciting enticing previews that I've ever seen in 30 years of movie going

30:25.400 --> 30:33.320
I mean the picture may be a total disaster but that preview is is classical in that it achieves

30:33.320 --> 30:40.880
the the result of giving a non-stop action filled impression to the to the viewer the engineer said

30:40.880 --> 30:47.280
do you remember the uh preview for the sword and sorcerer the sword and the sword and the sorcerer

30:47.280 --> 30:52.460
the second one who has apparently I didn't see it but apparently the preview was wonderful the

30:52.460 --> 30:59.600
movie was less than wonderful do you agree David it was far less than wonderful and on the other hand

30:59.600 --> 31:03.880
they'll they'll be previews of pictures and aren't so good and the picture turns out to be pretty good

31:04.460 --> 31:11.120
yeah as a matter of fact let's see what did I see no that was my wife an officer and a gentleman

31:11.120 --> 31:16.020
I didn't think it looked good in the previews and she said it wasn't any good as a movie so what can I

31:16.020 --> 31:19.960
tell you one picture that looked wonderful in the previews and always in the

31:19.960 --> 31:23.780
pro-scizely dull film uh French and the Tenderness Woman

31:23.780 --> 31:30.580
I never it never made it to the sticks out here that's right I read the book I love the book but

31:31.540 --> 31:35.780
didn't ever get to see the movie hey we don't want to continue to run up here Bill I can talk for

31:35.780 --> 31:40.240
another hour if you want I think that would be pointless from your point of view so I look forward

31:40.240 --> 31:45.680
to getting this I'm rather curious to see how illogical or whatever I turn out to be

31:46.020 --> 31:49.880
well thanks for being our guinea pig then and we've really enjoyed talking to you

31:51.240 --> 31:56.160
this fall sometime yeah these are our fall programs and we'll uh

31:56.160 --> 32:01.200
and if you want to call me back and add to it or if there are other no I would say other celebrities

32:01.200 --> 32:06.020
I'm not a celebrity if there are celebrities that you would like me to help you get in touch with

32:06.020 --> 32:10.800
you know within the right perspective and all just just call there's no problem great we sure

32:10.800 --> 32:13.680
appreciate it thanks Bill thank you Roger take care now bye bye
