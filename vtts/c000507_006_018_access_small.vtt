00:08.640 --> 00:12.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.820
And here are your hosts.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.100
This is Daryl Lane.

00:43.140 --> 00:43.760
And Bill Vernon.

00:44.340 --> 00:48.000
Donnelly Walheim is one of the versatile talents that science fiction occasionally produces.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.280
He's an author, editor, critic, and publisher of science fiction.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.440
And his influence on the field has been immense.

00:53.720 --> 00:58.500
He became involved in science fiction back in the early 30s, and many of the things he did had not been done before.

00:58.500 --> 01:03.320
He and Forrest Ackerman can be given much of the credit for starting fandom in the 1930s, for instance.

01:03.820 --> 01:06.660
And as an editor, he's been an innovator and creator many times over.

01:07.080 --> 01:13.580
In 1972, Walheim founded DAW Books, the first mass-market publishing house devoted entirely to science fiction.

01:14.020 --> 01:17.700
The word DAW, of course, comes from the initials of Donald A. Walheim's name.

01:18.180 --> 01:21.620
When we spoke with Walheim, we asked him if he would tell us about the beginning of DAW Books.

01:21.620 --> 01:25.660
Well, you know, I had been with A. Spokes for 19 and a half years.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.720
In fact, I was responsible for the founding of the company, though I didn't own it.

01:31.860 --> 01:35.960
And after the death of A. A. Wynn, who was his original publisher and owner,

01:37.340 --> 01:46.940
it passed into the hands of a group of Wall Street speculators who wanted to build up some kind of a conglomerate in the communications industry.

01:48.040 --> 01:58.220
Unfortunately, they made a number of bad mistakes, and in about three years, the company was run downhill to where they were in rather bad financial straits.

01:59.100 --> 02:05.580
And it was at that point, when it looked as if we were likely to have our doors closed at any minute or any day,

02:06.300 --> 02:12.580
that I got together and we talked, you know, I was thinking of the chance to do it, to get out and stop my own line.

02:12.580 --> 02:18.160
And the man who was the printer for A. Spokes came to me and said, you know, this is getting ridiculous.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.720
They owed him months and months of payment.

02:21.420 --> 02:23.960
He said, why don't we break loose and start our own company?

02:24.980 --> 02:28.000
Well, actually, that's put the idea in my head.

02:28.420 --> 02:30.460
But I didn't go into partnership with him.

02:30.740 --> 02:42.180
What I did is scout around and we were able to successfully leave A. and launch our own company under our name DAW Books,

02:42.180 --> 02:44.460
which is based on my initials.

02:44.560 --> 02:47.200
Walheim actually neither prints or markets his books.

02:48.120 --> 02:56.440
We made a very fine arrangement with the New American Library that publishes a signet book for distribution and for co-partnership,

02:56.540 --> 03:02.160
which means that in a sense I feed into their operations.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.040
I am my own editor, my own publisher.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.280
I'm an independent corporation, but they do our printing.

03:07.280 --> 03:11.540
They do our marketing and distribution and handle the minor details.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.360
And of course we pay them for this, but it's been a very profitable partnership between us.

03:16.920 --> 03:20.540
Walheim's wife, Elsie, helps him run DAW Books, so it's sort of a family affair.

03:21.260 --> 03:27.980
The odd thing about that was that originally my secretary from A. Spokes was going to come over with me.

03:28.620 --> 03:34.600
But she was a, she got a little panicky and was afraid to leave her, the staffer's job for one which was insecure.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.780
And she didn't come.

03:37.060 --> 03:40.580
Instead, my wife, who had many years ago before she married me,

03:41.180 --> 03:46.520
been president of her own small corporation in the manufacturing jewelry industry,

03:46.840 --> 03:52.840
knew the odds and ends of bookkeeping and management of her business, instead, you know, came with me.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.080
So she's working as my executive vice president.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.400
It's worked out marvelously.

03:57.540 --> 04:01.880
We're a husband and wife team that is really becoming one of the wonders of the industry.

04:02.780 --> 04:05.460
We asked Walheim how many books he puts out each year.

04:31.880 --> 04:38.660
We have other publishers that are now available again, or anthologies, or some of our annuals.

04:38.700 --> 04:42.780
We do several annuals, the year's best horror, year's best fantasy,

04:43.500 --> 04:47.060
and my own annual World's Best Science Fiction collection.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.280
That's always been one of our mainstays.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.680
More with Donal A. Walheim next time.

04:59.140 --> 05:02.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:02.460 --> 05:05.080
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

05:05.080 --> 05:08.220
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:01.720 --> 06:05.700
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:21.360 --> 06:26.640
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.940
And here are your hosts.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.960
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

06:37.200 --> 06:43.160
We're talking with Donal A. Walheim, Science Fiction author, editor, and presently the publisher of Daw's Science Fiction books.

06:43.580 --> 06:49.340
Daw's books is the only mass publisher devoted entirely to science fiction, and the company puts out some 60 titles each year.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.140
We asked Walheim how I select the books he'll publish.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.600
Is there a certain kind of story he looks for?

06:55.780 --> 07:02.740
Well, actually we try to be as varied as possible, but I go on, the premise in which I've always operated as an editor,

07:03.740 --> 07:05.440
if I like it I publish it.

07:06.600 --> 07:12.060
This is something which I sort of developed over the years, I've been almost 40 years as an editor,

07:12.780 --> 07:16.800
and I discovered that by good luck or bad luck or whatever you have it,

07:17.300 --> 07:22.720
I seem to be, what I like seems to be like what I write, at least 75% of the potential readers.

07:22.720 --> 07:27.080
So maybe I have good taste, maybe I have bad taste, I don't honestly know,

07:27.200 --> 07:31.500
but all I know is that what I like, I will find that my readers will generally like.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.260
So in science fiction, I like some good hardcore science fiction.

07:36.360 --> 07:44.260
I also like Good Adventure, the Edgar Rice borrows type.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.320
We do a series like that by Dray Prescott.

07:49.080 --> 07:56.880
And I like fantasy if it's nicely done, and I'm really quite, quite wide open in my taste.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.860
Walheim is noted as an editor and publisher who can spot new talent.

08:10.380 --> 08:15.240
In his over 40 years as an editor, he's been responsible for introducing many of today's big name writers to the field.

08:15.240 --> 08:19.200
Two of his fortunate finds at Daw Books have been CJ Sherry and Tanneth Lee,

08:19.580 --> 08:21.780
both of whom published their first novels for Walheim.

08:22.260 --> 08:24.360
We asked him how he locates writers of that caliber.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.900
Do they seek him out, or does he go looking for them?

08:27.600 --> 08:34.180
Both ways actually. We have an established image, people know what Daw Books are like,

08:34.280 --> 08:35.540
they know what they can expect from them.

08:35.540 --> 08:40.340
A lot of people who are faithful readers because they feel that almost every book that they buy,

08:40.340 --> 08:44.680
we got to know who writes it is going to be something they like because that tastes obviously similar to mine.

08:46.280 --> 08:52.480
We pride ourselves of being one of the very, very few companies that actually looks at and reads

08:52.480 --> 08:55.160
every unsolicited manuscript that comes in.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.860
We don't read it all the way through, but we look at it.

08:57.940 --> 09:02.020
Nothing goes through here without being inspected and read if it's possible.

09:02.620 --> 09:04.240
Now that's how we find new authors.

09:04.400 --> 09:08.040
We found CJ Sherry there, we found Tanneth Lee that way,

09:08.040 --> 09:14.960
we found well many other authors, Michael Foster and Doris Berserky and so on, Joe Clayton.

09:15.100 --> 09:20.520
They are people we found, but they submitted to us in the first place because they thought we were the kind of authors

09:20.520 --> 09:22.440
that was doing the kind of book they were writing.

09:23.140 --> 09:25.780
If we both agree, they're great.

09:32.800 --> 09:37.860
We asked Walheim if he ever suggests changes in an author's manuscript before he'll publish it.

09:38.660 --> 09:44.320
In a few instances we will suggest changes, but I don't really like that system.

09:45.260 --> 09:50.060
I pride myself in the fact that the people who become more or less regular contributors

09:50.860 --> 09:55.560
have gotten to know what I like and what I like is usually what they like.

09:55.560 --> 10:02.940
So we have a situation where I don't have to tell many authors to rewrite or anything like that.

10:03.140 --> 10:08.020
It's a project of course we'll discuss the possible terms of it before the thing is even written.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.200
There's a complete manuscript and I've read it and I like it.

10:11.900 --> 10:19.460
Great. I do very little actually in that sense of making an author revise and revise.

10:20.420 --> 10:24.780
What about suggesting to an author that he write a sequel or expand a novel into a trilogy?

10:26.020 --> 10:30.920
I usually do not. This is something that authors themselves come up with.

10:32.080 --> 10:36.960
Authors dream up trilogies and they'll submit a first novel so they're two more sequels.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.500
If I agree with it, I don't mind.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.720
We'll continue our conversation with Donnelly Walheim on our next show.

10:50.420 --> 10:52.980
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:53.280 --> 10:55.860
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:55.860 --> 10:59.040
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:45.740 --> 11:49.440
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:04.720 --> 12:10.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:13.180 --> 12:14.900
And here are your hosts.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.260
This is Daryl Lane.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.060
And Bill Vernon.

12:21.580 --> 12:24.880
Have you ever wondered what goes into the making of the Science Fiction paperback you just bought?

12:25.120 --> 12:28.500
You know that somebody wrote it and that some business enterprise printed it,

12:28.740 --> 12:31.120
but you probably don't think much beyond those general facts.

12:31.740 --> 12:35.580
It takes eight months usually for the typical paperback to complete the publishing cycle

12:35.580 --> 12:37.080
and a lot happens in that time.

12:37.080 --> 12:42.200
When we spoke with Donnelly Walheim, a pioneer fan, author and editor of Science Fiction,

12:42.620 --> 12:44.600
and now the publisher of Dahl Science Fiction books,

12:45.040 --> 12:48.060
we asked him if he would trace the publishing process through for us,

12:48.240 --> 12:50.260
beginning at the moment he receives a manuscript.

12:50.740 --> 12:51.420
Well, of course.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.700
As I said, I have a schedule of eight months ahead.

12:55.460 --> 12:59.880
Now, at the point that I like the manuscript, what I do is that

13:00.760 --> 13:06.280
is contact the author or the author's agent who ever submitted it and discuss contract

13:06.280 --> 13:09.860
and then we'll make up the contract which we sent to the author to be signed.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.640
We'll pay out the initial advance on that.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.440
And that will take about anywhere from three weeks to a month.

13:16.980 --> 13:18.920
And we put it in our inventory.

13:19.860 --> 13:21.940
The next step is selecting an artist for the cover.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.060
Walheim has an interesting method for that.

13:24.940 --> 13:30.760
If the book is on schedule, within about, well, let's say,

13:31.340 --> 13:33.200
within about two months or three months,

13:33.200 --> 13:39.340
I will take the manuscript and he have it copied, have it Xeroxed,

13:39.340 --> 13:44.420
and give a copy to an artist that I think would do the cover, the right cover for it.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.360
A number of different cover artists and some do better at certain types of stories than others.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.660
I prefer my artists to read the manuscript.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.980
If I want them to be actually science fiction readers to enjoy the subject,

13:57.800 --> 13:58.740
and they usually do.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.560
So if they get a cover, they get a manuscript,

14:01.560 --> 14:05.580
they will then have approximately one month to turn in the finished cover.

14:06.120 --> 14:10.020
What they will do is read it and then they will sketch out some possible covers,

14:10.120 --> 14:11.360
bring in the sketches.

14:12.020 --> 14:15.900
We will okay one of them or suggest changes.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.980
And they will have another couple of weeks to turn in the complete painting,

14:19.980 --> 14:22.700
which would be available at the end of that month.

14:23.720 --> 14:28.360
At that same time, we would then have to do and put together the copy for the cover,

14:28.360 --> 14:31.660
the material in the back cover, the titles and all that.

14:31.800 --> 14:40.640
We shall have to make out to a way, to an agency that does the layouts and picks type and all that.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.040
Then comes the important job of reading the manuscript to locate and correct errors.

14:46.300 --> 14:50.620
Meanwhile, we then have a month in which the book must be copy edited.

14:50.860 --> 14:54.520
That goes to an editor who goes over the manuscript making corrections,

14:55.200 --> 15:01.520
correcting spelling, correcting punctuation, making any minor changes that might be necessary.

15:02.260 --> 15:06.300
And I say minor because any major changes would be done by the author, never by the copy editor.

15:07.440 --> 15:15.120
So a month later, that manuscript would then go out to the production.

15:16.860 --> 15:21.520
Production as a man, this would go through the New American Library, you understand.

15:21.520 --> 15:25.300
But there's a man there who was an old friend of mine who worked for me,

15:25.340 --> 15:28.460
he's an ace in his working part at the New American Library now.

15:29.040 --> 15:36.060
He will design the book, he will determine the size type, the layout of the title page, the layout of pages,

15:36.340 --> 15:38.220
and we'll send it off to the printers.

15:39.280 --> 15:44.860
And we will next see in about, anywhere from two to five weeks,

15:46.040 --> 15:49.320
the galleys and proofs for the front.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.760
And by that time, it will be out a month ago.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.740
And the next thing we saw after that would be the book itself.

15:58.360 --> 16:05.020
This stretches out, so it's about five months involved in the actual production.

16:05.420 --> 16:12.020
But it's a leisurely pace, it stretches out, it works in very mechanically, and it just runs along.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.140
The paperback finally shows up in a bookstore or supermarket, of course,

16:16.440 --> 16:18.400
and in the case of dog books, it will be noticeable.

16:18.400 --> 16:23.740
That's because all dog books have bright yellow spines, so they'll stand out in the science fiction section of the bookstore.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.020
And a lot of intricate professional work lies behind that spine.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.940
We'll talk again with Don Delay-Walheim on our next show.

16:36.980 --> 16:39.380
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:39.740 --> 16:42.300
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:42.600 --> 16:45.500
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:27.080 --> 17:31.940
The next episode will be about the science fiction radio show.

17:31.940 --> 17:35.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:51.560 --> 17:56.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.000
And here are your hosts.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.200
This is Bill Vernon.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.060
And Daryl Lane.

18:07.280 --> 18:12.400
Since its inception in 1972, dog books has published some of the best science fiction being written today.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.900
For the founder of dog books, Don Delay-Walheim, it's been a satisfying and successful venture.

18:17.240 --> 18:24.280
So successful, in fact, that some people have wondered why dog books doesn't try hardback books in addition to the paperbacks it exclusively publishes.

18:24.760 --> 18:25.920
Walheim tells us why not.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.400
There's a couple of reasons for that.

18:28.580 --> 18:33.200
For one thing, I don't know the hardback field.

18:33.200 --> 18:39.680
I have, well, I've been an editor of pulp magazines and of paperback books,

18:40.260 --> 18:44.320
new stand-distributed books, since 1941.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.340
New York Times called me the dean of paperback editors.

18:48.780 --> 18:51.540
But to be frank, I have never been an editor of hardcover books.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.200
It's a somewhat different field.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.980
The marketing situation is different.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.880
The pricing situation is different.

18:58.260 --> 18:59.860
I would be sort of an amateur.

19:00.640 --> 19:05.620
And I don't believe in sticking my neck out into a field in which I really don't know what I'm doing.

19:06.860 --> 19:10.120
Now, I could, of course, make an arrangement with a hardcover publisher.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.120
But I don't see it.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.620
I don't believe in that a hardcover books sell that well.

19:17.600 --> 19:22.060
You print a week-well, after all, in paperbacks, you print by the tens of thousands of copies.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.680
In hardcover, you print one.

19:24.260 --> 19:27.160
Three thousand copies, five thousand, perhaps seven thousand.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.500
So hardcover editor comes in and says,

19:29.660 --> 19:30.800
gee, we've got a great item.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.100
It sells four thousand copies.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.320
Well, that's a joke to me.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.080
All right, there's money in it.

19:35.460 --> 19:37.200
But I don't need the headache.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.220
I don't want it.

19:38.580 --> 19:39.460
I don't see it.

19:41.380 --> 19:44.980
Other companies apparently do these things successfully.

19:45.280 --> 19:49.100
But that's because they're probably connected up with a hardcover publisher,

19:49.140 --> 19:50.440
people who know their business.

19:51.340 --> 19:54.000
I certainly don't feel that I wish to get involved.

20:04.420 --> 20:10.180
We asked Walheim how many copies of paperback science fiction books would have to sell before it generated a reasonable profit.

20:10.720 --> 20:16.440
That is very difficult to answer because it would depend on the size of the book and the price of the book.

20:16.880 --> 20:25.200
But very roughly, the average non-bestseller, say, book in the science fiction fantasy category,

20:26.420 --> 20:29.960
may do well at thirty thousand copies.

20:30.120 --> 20:34.280
In other words, by that point, it will have cleared its course and made a small profit.

20:34.780 --> 20:39.160
Obviously, if it makes fifty thousand, not sixty thousand, seventy five, or a hundred thousand, it's great.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.480
But the margin is quite low, surprisingly enough.

20:44.540 --> 20:48.500
And so it is not as risky as you may think.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.440
Finally, something of concern to all readers.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.800
What about the escalating prices of paperbacks?

20:53.800 --> 20:57.220
How long before high prices make a real difference and begin to hurt readers?

20:57.920 --> 20:59.540
I think it does make a difference.

20:59.640 --> 21:03.280
It hasn't affected science fiction, I think, because we have a very ardent audience.

21:04.020 --> 21:08.200
And in general, paperbacks are holding up much better than most of the book industry.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.960
But it does make a difference.

21:11.140 --> 21:14.660
The question of how far prices can go up is something I couldn't answer you,

21:14.700 --> 21:17.700
because this is, you know, economic speculation.

21:18.080 --> 21:18.840
Who in the heck knows?

21:18.840 --> 21:23.120
I mean, nobody can guess what the economy is.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.880
We all hope that the inflation will stop, and maybe it will.

21:27.040 --> 21:30.100
But if it doesn't, why, prices have to go up accordingly,

21:30.200 --> 21:34.180
because of the cost of paper, the cost of printers, the cost of binding,

21:34.360 --> 21:36.400
the cost of distribution, the cost of marketing.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.000
Everything goes up.

21:38.700 --> 21:42.740
And you've got to raise your price accordingly, or it's impossible to do business.

21:43.200 --> 21:47.240
We do try very hard to be conservative about pricing.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.680
We try to hold it back.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.600
We have discussions pretty regularly.

21:51.760 --> 21:55.260
I will sometimes suggest that a book should be, let us say, 250,

21:55.680 --> 21:58.120
and we'll have the head of marketing will come in and say,

21:58.240 --> 22:00.980
can't you make it 225, because you'd like to hold this down.

22:01.580 --> 22:02.980
And if it's practical, we will.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.720
If it's not practical, I can't.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.460
But the truth is that nobody wants to raise these prices,

22:08.700 --> 22:12.380
but we, you know, we get pressed, like anybody in any industry.

22:13.140 --> 22:16.440
We'll conclude our discussion with Donnelly Walheim on our next show.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:26.040 --> 22:28.660
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:28.660 --> 22:31.800
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:22.460 --> 23:26.440
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:42.080 --> 23:47.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.660
And here are your hosts.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.900
This is Daryl Lane.

23:56.980 --> 23:57.560
And Bill Vernon.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.540
Daw Books published some of today's most popular authors.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.040
We asked Donnelly Walheim, founder and editor of Daw Books,

24:04.320 --> 24:05.720
whose best-selling authors are?

24:06.260 --> 24:10.060
Well, our bestsellers are the John Norman Gore books,

24:11.480 --> 24:15.880
Andre Norton's novels, CJ Cherry does very nicely,

24:16.360 --> 24:18.840
Tammeth Lee goes back to press pretty continuously,

24:19.960 --> 24:26.740
and, uh, well, we have quite a number that do very nicely.

24:26.980 --> 24:30.880
Marion Zimmer Bradley, for instance, is always short,

24:31.220 --> 24:32.920
he kept continuously in print.

24:33.660 --> 24:36.700
We do Mike Moorcock books, and they're continuously in print.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.040
We do, well, well, many titles of that sort.

24:40.160 --> 24:44.380
So, uh, our bestseller is John Norman, of course.

24:44.380 --> 24:50.300
He sells by half a million at a book, and constantly in print.

24:51.460 --> 24:53.100
In addition to books by individual authors,

24:53.560 --> 24:55.900
Daw Books also publishes many anthologies each year.

24:56.140 --> 24:59.120
The best known is Daw's annual, The World's Best Science Fiction,

24:59.460 --> 25:02.340
published each year since Daw Books' inception in 1972.

25:03.580 --> 25:06.520
We asked Walheim if he selected the stories in his anthologies himself.

25:08.460 --> 25:12.680
Yes, it's a tough chore, and I work with Arthur Saha,

25:12.940 --> 25:14.580
who is an old-time science fiction fan,

25:15.700 --> 25:18.160
and a determined reader of everything that comes out.

25:18.920 --> 25:22.820
And so Saha does the first reading and sorts out the junk from the good ones,

25:23.400 --> 25:25.880
and gives me a list of what he thinks I should read.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.880
Well, that saves me an awful lot of work,

25:29.180 --> 25:32.440
and I sort through his recommended list,

25:32.440 --> 25:37.520
and finally we arrive at what we consider to be the ten best,

25:37.860 --> 25:40.300
and that creates our annual.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.180
Does he have any criteria he goes by?

25:43.740 --> 25:45.300
Yeah, if I like the story.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.700
Uh, basically, of course, it also is the originality of concept,

25:49.980 --> 25:53.300
and originality of plot, and of course, how well it's written.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.460
All these factors come into play.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.520
Well, generally speaking, if we had a really original idea,

25:59.520 --> 26:02.560
I would be strongly in favor of it.

26:02.740 --> 26:04.760
Unfortunately, science fiction being what it is,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.420
it's not too easy to come up with original ideas these days.

26:08.180 --> 26:11.680
We asked Walheim to tell us about some of the other anthologies Dogbooks puts out,

26:11.960 --> 26:13.940
and we also asked if his anthologies sold well.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.780
Uh, for us, they sell quite well.

26:17.660 --> 26:22.280
Uh, we have no problems with the annual.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.920
Uh, we reissue it, usually four years later,

26:25.920 --> 26:29.580
as Walheim's world's best series, five or four or six.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.800
Because you can't have a dated book.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.000
A dated book, it's prejudice is your dealer's.

26:34.700 --> 26:38.460
So our 1982 annual, which is coming out in a couple of months,

26:39.320 --> 26:41.200
Cross-Cubb is the best in 1981.

26:42.380 --> 26:45.900
Uh, other books, like the year's best horror stories,

26:46.100 --> 26:49.540
we are being edited for us by Carl Edward Wagner,

26:50.220 --> 26:53.140
who himself is a good name and a good writer in that field.

26:53.780 --> 26:58.740
Uh, year's best fantasy used to be edited for us by Limbe Carter,

26:58.820 --> 27:01.440
but now is being handled by Ross of Zaha directly.

27:03.560 --> 27:10.020
And, uh, Isaac Asimov is doing an encyclopedic study of the early days,

27:10.820 --> 27:14.020
beginning with 1939 and working up to the present,

27:14.280 --> 27:15.940
about two books a year.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.980
Well, Asimov presents the great SF stories.

27:20.200 --> 27:25.400
And, uh, I did one, one, one, uh, volume of Terra SF,

27:25.760 --> 27:28.560
which was the best stories from Eastern, from Western Europe,

27:29.240 --> 27:31.740
which is edited for me by a French science fiction fan

27:31.740 --> 27:34.900
that's familiar with the field and the mainstream range

27:34.900 --> 27:37.880
to get translations from all over, uh, Western Europe.

27:38.780 --> 27:42.400
Uh, I will probably continue that on, on a once every two years basis.

27:43.500 --> 27:44.820
So, uh, it works.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.420
Walheim has had a career in science fiction that's lasted over 50 years.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.780
In all aspects of science fiction, he's one of the pioneers of the field.

27:53.160 --> 27:57.560
He's been a fan, an author, a critic, an editor, and now with dog books, a publisher.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.600
As with few others, he's devoted his life to science fiction

28:00.600 --> 28:02.540
and left an indelible mark on the field.

28:09.700 --> 28:12.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:12.100 --> 28:15.040
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:15.040 --> 28:18.200
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:42.340 --> 28:43.740
Thank you.
