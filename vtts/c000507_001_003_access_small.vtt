00:09.560 --> 00:13.500
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:29.260 --> 00:34.620
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.460 --> 00:38.960
And here are your hosts.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.840
This is David Cruz.

00:45.100 --> 00:45.720
And Daryl Lane.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.360
One of the most honored and respected of today's science fiction authors is the English writer

00:50.360 --> 00:51.240
Brian Aldous.

00:51.700 --> 00:56.220
His first science fiction story was published in 1954, and since then he's won every award

00:56.220 --> 00:58.820
the field has to offer, both in this country and throughout Europe.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.200
Aldous is a craftsman of the highest order.

01:01.460 --> 01:06.060
The attention he gives to style, character and structure demonstrates the literary polish

01:06.060 --> 01:08.920
that often distinguishes British science fiction from American.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.920
He's written a few non-science fiction novels in fact that have been bestsellers in England.

01:13.620 --> 01:17.160
We asked him why he chose to concentrate his career in science fiction rather than mainstream

01:17.160 --> 01:17.620
literature.

01:18.640 --> 01:25.020
Well, I regard myself as a writer and this difference that seems to be so apparent to

01:25.020 --> 01:27.440
other people is not so apparent to me.

01:28.800 --> 01:35.700
I'm interested in a kind of literature of ideas and sometimes that strays to one side

01:35.700 --> 01:38.620
of the science fiction fence and sometimes to another.

01:40.260 --> 01:45.760
But it's not as though one day I'm riding a horse and the next day I'm riding a cow.

01:47.280 --> 01:55.700
It's just that I'm in the same vehicle all the time, but sometimes the identification

01:55.700 --> 01:56.760
marks change.

01:57.820 --> 01:59.340
That's the way I see it.

02:00.320 --> 02:05.060
In some of his personal essays on science fiction, Aldous tells of how he was introduced to the

02:05.060 --> 02:08.820
field as a child through Lurid pulp magazines he found at Woolworth's.

02:09.240 --> 02:13.540
His family disapproved of his reading such literature, but Aldous was fascinated and wouldn't

02:13.540 --> 02:14.020
give it up.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.080
He explains why he was so drawn to science fiction at an early age.

02:17.940 --> 02:25.460
I believe it was really that I never had a firm conviction as a child that the world

02:25.460 --> 02:28.480
was as all the grown-ups claimed it to be.

02:29.320 --> 02:36.400
It seemed to me that it was a much more interesting place than any of them believed or that they

02:36.400 --> 02:39.280
sought to deny it was an interesting place at all.

02:39.760 --> 02:45.840
They were all busy working in their shops and making their money and leading their routine

02:45.840 --> 02:46.460
knives.

02:47.800 --> 02:55.260
I was a bit of a scapeologist when I was a child.

02:56.640 --> 03:05.300
I picked up a phrase from an old cowboy movie where one of the wrestlers says out of the

03:05.300 --> 03:09.960
corner of his mouth, let's go while a goreng's good.

03:11.240 --> 03:18.640
And that became a kind of motto for me and at the age of four I was the hottest wrestler

03:18.640 --> 03:23.480
in East Deerham Norfolk and I used to go while the going was good.

03:25.140 --> 03:31.440
So I had that streak of wildness in me I suppose you could say.

03:32.740 --> 03:37.360
Aldous' streak of wildness later led to unique experiments in some of his science fiction

03:37.360 --> 03:37.800
novels.

03:37.800 --> 03:42.240
He gained a reputation as an innovator, as a science fiction author who wasn't afraid

03:42.240 --> 03:45.980
to introduce new styles and concepts into a fairly traditional field.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.840
Two good examples of his innovative techniques were the novels report on probability A in

03:50.840 --> 03:53.320
Barefoot in the Head published in the late 60s.

03:53.860 --> 03:57.360
Their complex styles were avant-garde and confusing to many science fiction readers.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.880
We asked Aldous if he deliberately sought to open up science fiction or enlarge its

04:01.880 --> 04:03.360
boundaries with such experiments.

04:04.540 --> 04:10.260
Would you understand that it's not exactly a motive in writing to expand the field?

04:11.680 --> 04:19.500
I think what you think you're doing at the time is trying to find a little, how should

04:19.500 --> 04:20.420
we mix the metaphor?

04:20.840 --> 04:27.860
Trying to find a little breathing space where the ground isn't too trampled already by the

04:27.860 --> 04:29.180
hordes of other writers.

04:30.580 --> 04:41.360
And so you seek out I suppose the perimeters of the field as it's currently defined.

04:42.440 --> 04:48.920
And in that way if you accidentally extend it well, that's very nice.

04:49.800 --> 04:54.500
And of course some people are grateful to you and other people are very cross with you for

04:54.500 --> 04:56.380
doing it because they say you're breaking the rules.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.720
Next time we'll talk with Brian Aldous about some of his works.

05:07.020 --> 05:11.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:11.140 --> 05:15.400
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:26.380 --> 05:56.360
Thank you.

06:00.680 --> 06:04.760
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:20.660 --> 06:26.040
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.460
And here are your hosts.

06:35.060 --> 06:36.180
This is Daryl Lane.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.140
And David Cruz.

06:37.640 --> 06:42.100
In 1973 Brian Aldous published a book on the origin and history of science fiction entitled

06:42.100 --> 06:43.180
Billion Years Spree.

06:43.620 --> 06:47.320
He gave us an interesting account of the reasons he wrote the book, including some comments

06:47.320 --> 06:49.420
on one of his novels, Barefoot in the Head.

06:50.240 --> 06:57.060
Well, I'd written a novel called Barefoot in the Head and it really didn't receive

06:58.000 --> 07:02.260
very kind initial attention, although the premise was simple enough.

07:03.580 --> 07:08.700
Barefoot in the Head was about the world stopped in its tracks by drugs.

07:09.040 --> 07:17.240
This was the late 60s, remember, when the Flower Power people had been around and we had had

07:17.240 --> 07:27.660
all this love in stuff and towards the end of the 60s the bills, as we say in England,

07:27.840 --> 07:33.220
the checks were coming in for all that kind of stuff and they were already finding the

07:33.220 --> 07:39.200
foetuses in the trash cans of Heat Ashbury so that Barefoot in the Head was an ambivalent

07:39.200 --> 07:40.980
book written in a difficult language.

07:40.980 --> 07:47.220
But I poured into it all I knew about A. science fiction and B. writing.

07:49.620 --> 07:57.680
And I was a little surprised at the tepid response it got, the angry response it got,

07:57.780 --> 07:58.840
the anonymous letters.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.460
So I thought, well, let's me finish with the science fiction field.

08:03.620 --> 08:10.160
And I thought, well, before I leave it I ought to write down all that I know and love about it

08:11.840 --> 08:12.880
before I forget.

08:13.980 --> 08:19.140
And so really I settled down with that in mind to write Billionaire Spree and also to have

08:19.140 --> 08:24.620
an argument as I raised my hat and left the science fiction or community.

08:26.300 --> 08:31.400
But by the time I got to the end of the thing, you know, three years had passed and

08:33.400 --> 08:36.860
just writing the book turned me on to science fiction again.

08:37.760 --> 08:41.080
Billionaire Spree is full of Aldous's personal but fascinating ideas.

08:41.700 --> 08:46.260
One provocative idea, heresy to some science fiction fans, was that Hugo Gernsback,

08:46.460 --> 08:49.660
the father of modern science fiction, was a disastrous influence on the field.

08:50.020 --> 08:51.760
We asked Aldous what he meant by that.

08:52.360 --> 08:58.460
Well, as you probably know, that I did say something of that sort and since then people

08:58.460 --> 09:03.480
have been threatening to break my legs and my arms and shoot me and hang me and kick

09:03.480 --> 09:06.980
me out of the science fiction field and all sorts of things like that.

09:07.960 --> 09:20.180
But I guess that what I was worried about was the way science fiction was segregated

09:20.180 --> 09:28.180
by Gernsback into a magazine so that if you wanted to find science fiction you had to

09:28.180 --> 09:39.620
go to a magazine that had a name like Astounding or Amazing or Staggering, which had a huge

09:39.620 --> 09:42.620
three-dimensional title with rivets in it.

09:44.440 --> 09:52.780
That resulted in a mono culture and we all know that there are dangers in mono culture.

09:53.780 --> 10:02.100
And I simply thought that the science fiction would be better as an uncaged animal that could

10:02.100 --> 10:04.480
rove at large where it would.

10:05.800 --> 10:13.120
But nowadays people complain that science fiction is segregated and that people think

10:13.340 --> 10:18.920
you're funny if you read it and that it has to have a special place in a bookshop right

10:18.920 --> 10:23.380
next to weirdo cult books about flying saucers or whatever.

10:24.040 --> 10:29.300
Well, my answer to that is that yes, I agree, I think that's too bad.

10:29.660 --> 10:31.980
I think science fiction is much better than that.

10:32.160 --> 10:38.300
But the reason why it is there is because of the segregation that was introduced by Hugo

10:38.300 --> 10:39.080
Gernsback.

10:39.660 --> 10:40.800
That was my argument.

10:41.820 --> 10:45.920
Anyone seeking to gain a perspective on science fiction and fantasy should read Billion

10:45.920 --> 10:50.200
Meier Spree, a personal but fascinating account of the field by one of science fiction's true

10:50.200 --> 10:50.760
men of letters.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.020
Tomorrow more with Brian Aldis.

11:00.200 --> 11:05.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

11:05.000 --> 11:08.880
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.900
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:16.880 --> 12:22.140
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.540
And here are your hosts.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.980
This is David Cruz.

12:33.320 --> 12:33.900
And Darrell Ang.

12:34.280 --> 12:38.280
Brian Aldis does unexpected but fascinating things in his science fiction stories.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.820
Though Aldis is often an innovator, he also understands and cherishes the traditions of

12:42.820 --> 12:43.400
science fiction.

12:43.400 --> 12:48.320
Aldis has demonstrated his fondness for science fiction's past by redoing some of its classic

12:48.320 --> 12:48.760
novels.

12:49.160 --> 12:53.720
An island called Moro, for instance, was based on H.G. Wells, the island of Dr. Moro.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.400
In his book, Frankenstein Unbound, drew on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, published in 1818,

12:58.900 --> 13:00.680
which some call a first science fiction novel.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.040
Aldis relates the impulse behind his writing of Frankenstein Unbound.

13:06.100 --> 13:13.120
I think that I write about the things that fascinate me most, and I'm kind of a literary

13:13.120 --> 13:13.680
man.

13:14.840 --> 13:20.150
And I certainly much admire Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

13:20.960 --> 13:27.180
It's the most remarkable work for anyone, not least for a young lady, not quite touching

13:27.180 --> 13:27.660
18.

13:28.980 --> 13:38.120
And when I had the impulse to write Frankenstein Unbound, it was really an exegetical impulse

13:38.660 --> 13:45.340
to draw everybody's attention, if possible, to the excellence of that original novel,

13:46.040 --> 13:54.020
which, as you know, has been slandered and pilloried by the filmmakers who've seen nothing

13:54.020 --> 13:59.380
better in it than a stupid, shambling and inarticulate monster.

14:00.260 --> 14:11.340
I wanted to restore the monster to his true evil power as an articulate feeling and maimed

14:11.340 --> 14:17.680
being worthy of our compassion, perhaps our hatred.

14:18.940 --> 14:22.900
Aldis says there was a true creative impulse behind Frankenstein Unbound.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.240
But that wasn't so for an island called Moro.

14:26.280 --> 14:34.220
I have to admit that later on I did the same thing with Wells' Island of Dr. Moro, and

14:35.060 --> 14:38.560
that was, I believe, an advice.

14:39.380 --> 14:49.160
It's one of the few novels I've written that didn't begin with some kind of genuine lust

14:49.160 --> 14:55.440
to create, will to create with fire in my stomach.

14:56.560 --> 15:01.080
I just thought it was something I could do, and that was too tiny a motive, I believe,

15:01.180 --> 15:03.020
for the book that I eventually turned out.

15:03.880 --> 15:11.920
I don't believe that it supersedes or in any way aids the Wells' version.

15:12.720 --> 15:18.100
The funny thing is, I have to say, that that novel was extremely well received.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.800
And in this country and in Great Britain.

15:22.180 --> 15:26.000
Another Aldis tribute to science fiction's past is his novella, The Saliva Tree.

15:26.360 --> 15:31.200
It's a playful book, a clever tribute to H.G. Wells, who happens to be an unseen character in it.

15:31.580 --> 15:35.680
It's about an invisible alien monster ravaging the countryside of late Victorian England.

15:36.200 --> 15:40.660
Invading monsters and invisibility are two of Wells' themes, of course, and during the story,

15:40.820 --> 15:44.140
all of Wells' themes and the titles of his books are somehow worked in.

15:44.140 --> 15:48.420
The story's main character, Gregory Rolls, has been writing letters to H.G. Wells

15:48.420 --> 15:49.940
about the happenings in the countryside.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.760
Wells comes to meet Rolls as the story ends.

15:53.840 --> 16:03.760
Our central character is about to relate to H.G. Wells the horrific events that have gone on down on the farm.

16:05.160 --> 16:14.460
And in those events are really the germs for all of Wells' science fiction.

16:16.020 --> 16:22.440
I mean, you know, there's a kind of a joke on H.G. Wells there.

16:22.720 --> 16:30.300
I mean, we all owe a great debt to H.G. Wells because he preempted almost all of the science fiction themes.

16:31.020 --> 16:37.080
And so in a way, the saliva tree is a kind of horrific joke to show that in fact,

16:37.480 --> 16:39.480
Wells didn't have any original ideas.

16:39.700 --> 16:44.400
They were all given to him by this guy who knocks on the door at the end of the story.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.920
More on the works of Brian Aldis next time.

16:54.880 --> 17:00.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

17:00.500 --> 17:03.700
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:17.920 --> 17:47.900
The Science Fiction Radio Show is a production of the Science Fiction Radio Show.

17:53.220 --> 17:57.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:13.160 --> 18:18.580
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.020
And here are your hosts.

18:27.580 --> 18:28.780
This is Daryl Lane.

18:29.100 --> 18:29.780
And David Cruz.

18:30.300 --> 18:34.540
English science fiction author Brian Aldis sometimes writes books which are difficult to categorize.

18:34.800 --> 18:41.440
Aldis has written familiar science fiction such as his first novel, which was published in this country in 1959 as Starship.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.320
But many of his novels are experimental or avant-garde in both theme and structure.

18:45.320 --> 18:49.580
Report on Probability A published in 1969 is a good example of his type.

18:50.160 --> 18:57.120
A 1976 novel though, The Melasia Tapestry, is one of his most unique novels, a strange but richly rewarding book.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.000
And it completely resists categories.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.900
It could be called science fiction, but it's not quite that.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.500
Some might say it's fantasy, but it's not that either.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.420
Aldis talks about the inspiration behind the book.

19:08.380 --> 19:14.080
The model I had was a pictorial one.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.180
That's often the case.

19:17.160 --> 19:23.960
Well, in several of my novels, I start from a pictorial beginning.

19:24.960 --> 19:38.720
And my pictorial beginnings with Melasia were the etchings which the Italian artist, the Baroque artist, G.B.T. Epileau, made at the end of his life.

19:39.700 --> 19:53.060
Towards the end of his life, he retired and he started etching these mysterious little pictures of women.

19:54.260 --> 20:10.380
Wizards, Monte Banks, soldiers, punchinellos, people being dug out of the ground from graves, owls, serpents burning on altars.

20:10.760 --> 20:14.200
All sorts of mysterious symbols in these lovely little pictures.

20:15.020 --> 20:17.240
And no one's actually figured out what they meant to be.

20:17.240 --> 20:30.480
It's like a science-fiction alternative world where magic rules, I suppose you'd say, and I suppose that was one of the things I liked about them.

20:31.560 --> 20:40.000
So I thought, well, if no one else can reconstruct this world to their satisfaction, I'll have a go at it.

20:41.200 --> 20:49.980
And so I started writing short stories around the more haunting of these etchings of T. Epileaus.

20:50.920 --> 20:56.940
Melasia itself is a grand city which exists in what appears to be an alternate universe, suggestive of Earth's ancient past.

20:57.440 --> 21:05.300
There is no technology to speak of, sorcery of a limited sort seems to work, and there are all manner of exotic creatures such as flying beings which resemble humans.

21:05.300 --> 21:12.400
The novel's main concern is art, an unusual theme for a science-fiction or fantasy book, seemingly more appropriate for a romantic poet.

21:12.840 --> 21:17.100
Aldous told us that the theme of art came out of a serious illness he had while writing the book.

21:18.020 --> 21:39.320
The effect of this internal complaint I had, this hepatitis, made me feel that, well, my lifespan was limited, and I'd froliced about a good deal and had written some books that I perhaps didn't take as seriously as I should do,

21:40.620 --> 21:47.280
and that what I dearly loved was writing, and that I wanted to make a statement about art.

21:49.660 --> 21:54.460
And really, Melasia is, it's all about art from the title onwards.

21:54.460 --> 22:12.400
In other words, if the book has a power, it is the power of meditations on the nature of art, which is at once to transfigure, and at the same time to petrify.

22:12.400 --> 22:22.340
And as you know, Melasia itself is a city-state under a curse of zero change.

22:23.740 --> 22:34.180
Well, that's like a work of art, it's like Tiepolo's little etchings. They may be forever enigmatic to us, but they're forever unchanging.

22:35.060 --> 22:42.100
The Melasia Tapestry by one of the masters of modern science fiction, a difficult novel to categorize but a fascinating one to read.

22:42.540 --> 22:44.760
More with author Brian Aldous on our next show.

23:05.180 --> 23:34.160
The Melasia Tapestry by one of the masters of modern science fiction, a difficult novel to categorize but a fascinating one to read.

23:48.600 --> 23:52.620
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

24:09.060 --> 24:14.400
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.900
And here are your hosts.

24:23.740 --> 24:25.120
This is David Cruz.

24:25.380 --> 24:25.980
And Daryl Lane.

24:26.380 --> 24:32.560
Brian Aldous' latest science fiction novel is the masterful achievement of an author who is at the height of his very awesome powers.

24:32.560 --> 24:38.200
It's called Heliconia Spring, and it's the first volume of a trilogy about an Earth-like planet called Heliconia.

24:38.540 --> 24:40.860
Aldous tells us about the planet and the books.

24:42.760 --> 24:50.600
Heliconia is the name of a planet that's really much like Earth, and a lot of Earth-like things go on there.

24:51.540 --> 25:04.340
But it is the child of binary suns, and it takes two and a half thousand years to go around the primary.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.780
I mean two and a half thousand Earth years.

25:11.560 --> 25:23.700
Which is to say that between one winter and the next, you can have a whole lot of civilizations doing a whole lot of declining and falling.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.880
And of course, falling and rising.

25:28.880 --> 25:38.940
And so that these three long volumes really just cover parts of one of Heliconia's great years.

25:40.000 --> 25:52.220
So there's at once this marvellous continuity, as I see it, of one year and yet of many generations and many cultures.

25:53.820 --> 25:56.640
And that's the basic plan of the book.

25:57.060 --> 26:01.420
They're simply titled, The First One's Heliconia Spring, that's the one that's out.

26:01.860 --> 26:08.500
The one I'm writing is Heliconia Summer, and after that I go on to Heliconia Winter.

26:22.220 --> 26:26.700
The first volume traces the life of a nomadic hunter named Yuli and his descendants.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.800
Because the first volume is about the sun bursting out.

26:32.560 --> 26:40.200
The first volume is just stacked full of things bursting out, and people bursting out, animals bursting out.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.560
It's a great bursting out novel.

26:51.440 --> 26:58.700
Circling Heliconia is a satellite from Earth, a huge observation station which monitors everything that happens in Heliconia and beams it to Earth.

26:59.120 --> 27:03.820
Aldous spent a painstaking four years on the book, striving for accuracy and realism.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.780
Well, I hope people will find that it's full of reality.

27:10.640 --> 27:19.920
That's why I say the moral of it should be mere existence, because I think they recognize their own lives passing through the book.

27:21.000 --> 27:35.960
And the other motive I had was that I grew rather alarmed at the way so much science fiction, since it's become more popular,

27:37.020 --> 27:43.060
has been full of, what shall we say, fantasy, wish fulfillment.

27:44.020 --> 27:55.960
I didn't like that. I think that science fiction should reflect the facts of life, the hard facts of life.

27:56.760 --> 28:08.080
It shouldn't just be some nonsense about one guy against a malign empire who goes out and kills the chief baddie.

28:08.760 --> 28:16.420
I thought it should have a little more contact for reality, and moreover, I'll sound old fashioned if I say this,

28:16.920 --> 28:27.640
but I think that sort of thing is better for the nation's youth than the old hogwash about telepathic dragons and all the rest of it.

28:34.540 --> 28:41.780
Hello, Coney, a spring is a remarkable and unique achievement by a man who is not just a great science fiction writer, but one of the finest writers of our time.

28:49.040 --> 28:58.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:11.780 --> 29:22.760
Thank you for watching.
