Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.500
And here are your hosts.

00:43.940 --> 00:49.240
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. British-born author James P. Hogan has gained a reputation

00:49.240 --> 00:52.260
as one of the premier writers of hard science fiction working today.

00:52.700 --> 00:57.440
He's published seven novels so far, including In Here at the Stars, The Gentle Giants of

00:58.140 --> 01:03.680
Giant Star, Thrice Upon a Time, The Two Faces of Tomorrow, and his latest voyage from yesteryear.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.700
Hogan tells us how he became an author.

01:06.780 --> 01:15.600
When I left school when I was 16 and wanted to be a writer then, I guess it was something that I

01:15.600 --> 01:22.180
always enjoyed doing as a kid at school. In the essays and the story writing exercises you get.

01:24.320 --> 01:27.860
And when I left school I told the world I was going to be a writer.

01:29.020 --> 01:37.400
And it seemed a good idea until somebody said, well, with all the accumulated wisdom and experience

01:37.400 --> 01:42.000
of 16 years, what are you going to write about that the world is breathlessly waiting to hear?

01:43.320 --> 01:46.360
And I hadn't thought about that and the answer was not a lot.

01:47.060 --> 01:52.460
So I went away into engineering and electronics and computers and things like that for something like

01:52.460 --> 02:01.580
20 years. And I suppose the interest in writing probably never went away.

02:02.460 --> 02:07.600
For 20 years, Hogan worked as a systems designer for computers and sold computers to scientists

02:07.600 --> 02:08.840
for use in their research.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.560
Associating with scientists as he did, Hogan was exposed to all sorts of current scientific

02:13.560 --> 02:18.020
research and he would make use of his scientific contacts when he began to write seriously.

02:19.160 --> 02:25.340
I made use of my customers pretty freely as consultants, which was kind of handy.

02:25.620 --> 02:31.960
I found that I had customers who were brain surgeons and other customers who were studied pieces of

02:31.960 --> 02:38.500
rock brought back from the Apollo missions and other guys who were building in or investigating

02:38.500 --> 02:45.140
machine intelligence. And just about any of the topics or the favorite themes of science fiction

02:45.140 --> 02:51.860
that you could take out of a hat, the chances were sort of not 10 to 1. I had a customer

02:51.860 --> 02:57.040
specializing in that field and I just had to, if I needed some background information on a

02:57.040 --> 03:02.220
particular topic, I could almost guarantee I had a phone number in my diary as a guy who could

03:02.220 --> 03:09.160
talk all day about it. And they love doing it as well. I used to call them and they like to come

03:09.160 --> 03:15.880
and talk to you tomorrow. Well, we're a little busy, but what's it about? Oh, I need some help with

03:15.880 --> 03:19.880
the book I'm working on. Well, why didn't you say so? What times do you want to show up? And they

03:19.880 --> 03:31.200
talk all day. I think this is one of the interesting sites of selling computers into

03:31.740 --> 03:39.460
this kind of area. You can imagine some of these specialists, they talk to bacteria all day long

03:39.460 --> 03:45.620
or whatever and they end up shutting the back rooms of universities. And maybe there are four

03:45.620 --> 03:52.300
people on the planet they can talk to who understand their language. And sometimes they find it hard

03:52.300 --> 04:00.100
to believe that somebody from the world outside that has walked in off the street is sincerely

04:00.780 --> 04:06.980
interested to sit down and talk to them and is curious and he wants to know what they're doing,

04:07.080 --> 04:11.840
wants to have it explained. So writing about his experiences with scientists,

04:12.340 --> 04:19.280
Hogan found that he was a science fiction writer. I didn't particularly set out to be a science

04:19.280 --> 04:25.480
fiction writer. I suppose I became one by accident. I just always wanted to write and started writing

04:25.480 --> 04:32.200
stories about the little bit of life that I'd had some personal experience of and was told I was a

04:32.200 --> 04:37.260
science fiction writer and I said, how's that? They said, well, the publisher is publishing it under

04:37.260 --> 04:42.560
their science fiction influence. So we guess you have to be so I said, okay. And it kind of started

04:42.560 --> 04:48.600
out like that. Hogan's books are scientifically accurate and highly realistic. He's been called

04:48.600 --> 04:53.160
The Man Who Put Science Back into Science Fiction. Next time we'll talk to James P. Hogan about some

04:53.160 --> 05:05.380
of his novels. This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin

05:05.380 --> 05:09.940
Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:51.440 --> 05:55.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show. So stay with us.

06:03.160 --> 06:03.880
You

06:11.580 --> 06:17.020
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.460
And here are your hosts.

06:25.880 --> 06:31.040
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. James P. Hogan's 1977 science fiction novel,

06:31.140 --> 06:35.620
Inherit the Stars, should be required reading for anyone who demands scientific accuracy in

06:35.620 --> 06:40.780
an exciting narrative. The book takes place some 50 years in the future. A skeleton inside a spacesuit

06:40.780 --> 06:45.580
is found on the moon. That's interesting enough. But what follows is even more provocative. The

06:45.580 --> 06:50.980
skeleton is a human one and it's been on the moon for 50,000 years. The scientific unraveling of this

06:50.980 --> 06:56.000
mystery forms the basis of the novel. It's like a detective story and Hogan talks about the origins

06:56.000 --> 07:05.100
of the idea. 2001 was one of the factors that inspired me to write Inherit the Stars. I love the

07:05.100 --> 07:12.180
idea of something being found, a mystery being uncovered in the course of lunar exploration

07:12.930 --> 07:18.180
that was sufficiently intriguing to motivate a lot of scientists into unraveling it.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.180
It seemed a good opportunity to set the scientific detective story that I wanted to write.

07:27.900 --> 07:32.280
You know, okay, let's have the detective story or the mystery that the detectives are trying to

07:32.280 --> 07:38.900
solve hinge around something that's turned up on the moon. Well, dead bodies are always pretty good

07:38.900 --> 07:47.860
for detective stories. It ought to be a more interesting dead body than the standard detective

07:47.860 --> 07:54.040
thriller. So let's make it 50,000 years old and human, which raises the whole, opens up the whole

07:54.040 --> 07:59.880
bag of worms. And let's just see how they unravel that. And I wanted the ending to be

08:02.400 --> 08:09.460
a bit of a twist, a bit unexpected, a bit of a surprise, but nevertheless plausible and

08:09.460 --> 08:13.940
rational within the context of the story. I didn't want to bring in mystical agencies or

08:18.360 --> 08:22.520
strange laws of physics or anything like this to hold it together.

08:23.440 --> 08:27.820
The entire scientific community of Earth starts to work on the baffling problem of the

08:27.820 --> 08:33.040
space-suited 50,000 year old human skeleton, which they name Charlie. They soon find remnants on the

08:33.040 --> 08:38.560
moon of Charlie's culture, a map of an unfamiliar planet, scraps of Charlie's diary in an unfamiliar

08:38.560 --> 08:43.800
language, and some technological artifacts. With such clues, the scientists begin to piece

08:43.800 --> 08:49.080
together the incredible story of who Charlie was and why he was human. Hogan says the book sort of

08:49.080 --> 08:54.160
defines what science is all about. It counters some of the distorted images of scientists Hogan has

08:54.160 --> 09:00.420
seen in fiction. Scientists were always eccentric and they wore odd colored shoes and they drew

09:00.420 --> 09:06.720
cabbages that ate people and they wanted to conquer the world or something. And there are these

09:06.720 --> 09:14.180
kind of cute public impressions of scientists as people who run down the street with no clothes

09:14.180 --> 09:29.700
on shouting Eureka. Or you read phrases like it came to him in a flash and you read on and

09:30.660 --> 09:35.600
what came to him in a flash would have been enough to keep Einstein busy for the next 20 years.

09:36.380 --> 09:44.340
And real science, you know, there are insights, there are strokes of genius, but the overwhelming

09:45.380 --> 09:51.380
bulk of the work is done by a lot of unsung heroes, a lot of people doing nothing really

09:51.380 --> 09:58.020
dramatic or exciting, but just meticulously sifting through details, collecting information.

09:59.020 --> 10:04.580
For generations and for centuries, all different parts of the world. And it's really like putting

10:04.580 --> 10:11.140
together a huge jigsaw puzzle, lots of people cutting out pieces and pushing them around and

10:11.140 --> 10:16.280
every now and again somebody will take a huge chunk in this corner and see that it fits with a huge

10:16.280 --> 10:22.980
chunk down there and that's a breakthrough. And so it goes on. And it really is a detective story.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.920
I think it's a far more exciting one than most detective fiction.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.620
We strongly recommend you read Inherit the Stars to find out the solution to the mystery

10:30.620 --> 10:35.800
surrounding Charlie. Hogan wrote two sequels to Inherit the Stars and all three form a trilogy

10:35.800 --> 10:41.120
that presents an awesome view of man's origins. Next time we'll talk with Hogan about those other two books.

10:48.400 --> 10:53.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

10:53.140 --> 10:57.000
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:40.280 --> 11:44.220
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:00.300 --> 12:05.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.000
And here are your hosts.

12:14.920 --> 12:20.080
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. James P. Hogan's science fiction novel Inherit the Stars

12:20.080 --> 12:23.580
was popular enough with readers to justify a sequel, two of them in fact.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.820
The first was entitled A Gentle Giant's of Ganymede and was published in 1978.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.980
Hogan explains why he wrote the book.

12:30.920 --> 12:36.460
When I wrote Inherit the Stars I had three books in mind. I had a trilogy in mind.

12:38.120 --> 12:43.460
So I put the hooks in, although Inherit the Stars was a complete story in itself,

12:44.000 --> 12:48.320
you know, it didn't leave anything, it didn't leave the reader hanging. It told and it started

12:48.320 --> 12:53.400
and told and finished a story. Nevertheless, there were a couple of hooks in there that invited

12:53.400 --> 13:03.900
some questions, which sort of paved the way to a follow-up book. And my thinking at the time was,

13:04.060 --> 13:11.800
I'll go that far, but I won't write the second book until I have some feedback as to how the

13:11.800 --> 13:19.600
readers liked the first one. And I got a lot of mail and they all liked it and a lot of them

13:19.600 --> 13:24.700
said in their letters, will there be a follow-up? They picked out the hooks. So I wrote The Gentle

13:24.700 --> 13:30.320
Giants. The Gentle Giants of the title are a race of aliens that first turned up in Inherit the

13:30.320 --> 13:34.880
Stars. In that book, scientists from Earth had discovered a wrecked spaceship on Ganymede,

13:35.160 --> 13:39.580
one of Jupiter's huge moons. And on it were the remains of prehistoric creatures from Earth,

13:39.580 --> 13:45.160
dinosaurs and the like. In The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, humans meet some live Ganymians who

13:45.160 --> 13:49.740
have returned to the solar system after a mishap in space kept them away for some 25 million years

13:49.740 --> 13:54.500
due to time dilation. It turns out that the Ganymians had been responsible for human evolution.

13:55.140 --> 13:59.140
They'd taken primitive hominids from Earth 25 million years ago and moved them to a planet

13:59.140 --> 14:04.760
called Minerva. Minerva was then one of the inner planets of our solar system, but it was destroyed

14:04.760 --> 14:08.920
in a tremendous war involving the human stock that had evolved from the Ganymian experiments.

14:09.660 --> 14:13.960
The second book ends with the Ganymians leaving the solar system in search of their own people,

14:14.240 --> 14:17.860
who migrated from Minerva millions of years before the war that destroyed the planet.

14:18.340 --> 14:20.300
Hogan says readers wanted a third book.

14:21.740 --> 14:28.040
And they wanted another one and I did have a trilogy in mind when I wrote it. And the third one

14:28.040 --> 14:34.180
in that series is now written. It's called Giant Star and it will be, it's a July title,

14:34.700 --> 14:41.040
so it should start to appear in the bookstores around June. It's the third and last, it won't be

14:41.040 --> 14:48.000
any more in that series. So it ties up a few of the loose ends, tells another story,

14:52.100 --> 15:02.620
continues with the characters we met in the previous two books, both the terrestrial and the

15:12.200 --> 15:12.720
one.

15:12.720 --> 15:17.480
Giant Star was published in 1981 and as Hogan said, it wraps up all the mysteries and loose ends

15:17.480 --> 15:22.540
raised in the first two books. And it presents an absolutely breathtaking concept of man's origins,

15:23.320 --> 15:28.040
explaining also where man gets his curious nature, his aggressiveness, and his incredible

15:28.040 --> 15:33.100
instinct for survival. Hogan talks about the underlying purpose of the whole trilogy.

15:33.960 --> 15:40.460
Basically it was an attempt to depict science as it is, or at least as I perceive it.

15:41.120 --> 15:46.640
And at the same time weave that into a story that people who were non-scientists, non-specialists,

15:46.720 --> 15:54.120
would find stimulating and arousing for the curiosity, even if

15:56.340 --> 16:02.400
without trying to turn it into a 250-page lab report or something like that.

16:03.460 --> 16:07.620
And stimulating the books certainly are. For sheer grandeur, the whole Minervan trilogy,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.740
as some have called it, is matched by a few other works in the field of science fiction.

16:12.120 --> 16:17.480
Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy comes to mind as a comparison, as does Olaf Stapleton's Arjan.

16:18.060 --> 16:22.700
James B. Hogan's Inherit the Stars, The General Giants of Ganymede, and Giant Star.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.160
Contemporary science fiction has little to offer that's any better.

16:33.420 --> 16:38.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:38.240 --> 16:42.100
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:24.640 --> 17:28.880
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:44.700 --> 17:50.020
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.400
And here are your hosts.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.880
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.020
Time travel is one of the traditional themes of science fiction.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.780
One of the best, certainly one of the most realistic time travel books,

18:08.160 --> 18:11.100
is James Hogan's Thrice Upon a Time, which came out in 1980.

18:11.960 --> 18:15.700
But for some time, for a number of years, in fact, before I wrote Thrice Upon a Time,

18:15.740 --> 18:19.040
I'd been wanting to write a time travel book for a number of reasons.

18:19.900 --> 18:27.560
Firstly, I wanted to attempt to face up to the paradoxes, the logical paradoxes,

18:27.880 --> 18:36.800
once and for all, and answer them without top-outs, without convenient coincidences,

18:37.780 --> 18:43.860
and without obliging characters who just happen to do the right thing to make everything come out

18:43.860 --> 18:54.340
the way the author said. And secondly, I wanted to get away from this kind of cliche of some kind

18:54.340 --> 19:01.180
of a conjurer's box, described or described as whatever, that you jump into and you jump out of

19:01.180 --> 19:07.380
and you're in some other time. We seem too many conjurer's boxes, and it seemed to me unrealistic

19:08.540 --> 19:13.240
if I ever built a box like that and I thought it was going to take me to another time,

19:13.860 --> 19:19.100
I certainly would jump into it and press the button. It would conduct a long series of tests

19:19.100 --> 19:22.120
and experiments first, and none of that here I was ever thinking to do this.

19:23.120 --> 19:27.780
Hogan wanted to avoid some of the cliches or formulas that characterized most time travel stories.

19:28.900 --> 19:34.560
I think in too many stories, time machines are used like Starships, they're just a device,

19:34.840 --> 19:41.640
a vehicle, to get some characters into an unusual environment, and then tell a pretty routine story

19:41.640 --> 19:47.920
that would stole them from Greek mythology or European medieval history, and the technology

19:47.920 --> 19:52.800
doesn't come into the story at all, they could have gone the on a greyhound bus. I didn't want to

19:52.800 --> 20:00.580
do that, and so the story was about some physicists who had stumbled upon this phenomenon and had

20:01.800 --> 20:07.560
realized that if what they were seeing meant what they thought it meant, it meant that they could

20:09.860 --> 20:15.040
actually inject information into the past and change the past with all the questions that

20:15.040 --> 20:26.520
implied, and being proceeded to test this phenomenon and the pains and very very strange results.

20:27.420 --> 20:30.900
The strange thing the physicists learn is that they can send messages into the past,

20:31.100 --> 20:36.300
not far into the past, maybe just 10 minutes. I didn't want it to be a million years or a billion

20:36.300 --> 20:43.580
years or some huge span of time where really nothing that you did could make any difference.

20:43.660 --> 20:49.360
How about a lab bench experiment, 10 minutes? Now you can just send a little signal back to

20:49.360 --> 20:54.500
yourself 10 minutes ago and change what you've already done. This is interesting, you're hard

20:54.500 --> 21:00.360
up against the paradoxes now, you can't find a way around them or duck them, you've got to

21:00.360 --> 21:06.680
answer the question what happened. The logic of the whole situation becomes absolutely,

21:07.800 --> 21:10.720
it's likely to the point of insanity trying to figure it out.

21:11.620 --> 21:15.660
It was the logic and the science implied by the time travel theme that fascinated Hogan.

21:16.340 --> 21:20.860
He wanted to approach the concept realistically. And it's so realistic that you feel after reading

21:20.860 --> 21:24.660
the book you could go down to Radio Shack and buy the parts to make a time travel machine.

21:25.320 --> 21:29.700
Recently a number of responsible scientists have been speculating on the actual possibility of

21:29.700 --> 21:34.880
time travel. We asked Hogan if he thought it would ever be a reality and if his book was meant to be

21:34.880 --> 21:41.760
prophetic. Well I don't know whether it's prophetic or not. Well as is elaborated in the book itself

21:42.440 --> 21:47.960
if something like that ever became a fact there are some pretty interesting problems

21:47.960 --> 21:54.460
that are going to have to be solved and our ideas of logic and cause and effect are going to have

21:54.460 --> 22:00.420
to undergo some pretty interesting revisions. So I'm certainly not setting myself up as a

22:00.420 --> 22:07.180
prophet saying yes it'll happen. Maybe I don't know I think history has shown that impossible

22:07.180 --> 22:11.460
or it'll never happen are very dangerous phrases to use in any context.

22:12.300 --> 22:14.120
Morals James P. Hogan next time.

22:21.200 --> 22:26.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

22:26.140 --> 22:30.000
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:12.740 --> 23:14.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

23:31.880 --> 23:37.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.300
And here are your hosts.

23:46.660 --> 23:51.000
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. Of all science fiction writers working today

23:51.000 --> 23:56.100
no one surpasses James P. Hogan in scientific accuracy and realism. Hogan's publisher

23:56.100 --> 23:59.940
Ballantine Books has advertised him as the man who put science back in science fiction.

24:00.420 --> 24:04.800
And after reading books like Thrice Upon a Time and The Two Faces of Tomorrow you realize how

24:04.800 --> 24:09.340
much he deserves that description. Hogan is also concerned with realism with the kind of

24:09.340 --> 24:13.360
everyday detail that makes his story even though it's set in the future a totally believable one.

24:13.700 --> 24:19.600
He explains why realistic detail is important. I think these kinds of details do matter because

24:20.700 --> 24:28.580
if we are if we're putting a story into a futuristic setting I think the

24:30.980 --> 24:36.340
little details of background such as if the guy needs to make a phone tour how does he go about

24:36.340 --> 24:43.720
it if he needs to render CAD these matter because if the story is being told in the future the whole

24:43.720 --> 24:51.460
back the whole of the background has to be consistently futuristic. I've come across a number

24:51.460 --> 24:57.860
of instances which are in my opinion a little flawed because uh spelt with an AW.

24:59.640 --> 25:07.500
But a writer may have seized on a particular thought maybe a new scientific idea or a machine

25:07.500 --> 25:14.840
or whatever. Develops that very well but kind of gets hung up on it and in the background

25:14.840 --> 25:18.220
everything else that's going on hasn't changed since 1980.

25:21.920 --> 25:27.080
And trying to I think just stop typing for the five minutes it takes just to think about a

25:27.080 --> 25:31.140
situation the guy's going to make a phone call just like stop and think how he might make that

25:33.060 --> 25:41.800
and think about it for five minutes and then maybe show it in a way different to what would

25:41.800 --> 25:45.340
have been the positive thing to do in the first couple of seconds.

25:54.120 --> 25:58.320
Hogan says that his readers appreciate his attention to realistic detail and accuracy.

25:58.700 --> 26:02.780
In fact he thinks he attracts some readers who don't normally read science fiction because of it.

26:03.840 --> 26:08.180
From the people who who write to me and the people that I meet

26:09.120 --> 26:15.940
one of the gratifying things I observe in the readership that I have is that very

26:16.620 --> 26:23.720
it is not confined to what might be termed the hardcore science fiction reader who buys

26:23.720 --> 26:30.060
anything new that appears on the science fiction section of the bookstores. But a lot of I suppose

26:30.060 --> 26:37.440
people who might be termed younger professional people in their late 20s 30s 40s in all manner

26:37.440 --> 26:43.380
of professions not necessarily to do with the scientists teachers lawyers doctors so forth

26:44.780 --> 26:50.840
who typically would say gee I haven't I used to read science fiction when I was at college or

26:50.840 --> 26:57.360
when I was at university but I kind of grew out of it. I can't relate to the way out galaxies

26:57.360 --> 27:02.780
like years away anymore or aliens running around with ray guns. Today I have a family

27:02.780 --> 27:09.760
of career of mortgage my feet are solidly on the surface of this planet but they seem to like stories

27:09.760 --> 27:15.360
that don't kind of try and take them to the other side of the universe a million years from now but

27:15.360 --> 27:21.920
maybe just stretch the future 20 or 30 years. They may find names in the book like IBM and

27:21.920 --> 27:29.700
Avis and Boeing familiar places and it kind of grabs them. They say well you know this I can relate

27:29.700 --> 27:34.920
to it's the world that I live in just stretched a little bit the connection is not broken the

27:34.920 --> 27:39.820
economics and the politics have evolved from what I read in the papers I can still see the connections

27:40.400 --> 27:46.360
and it could be the world my kids go up in and I like it. Hogan's latest novel Voyage from

27:46.360 --> 27:50.720
yesteryear is further in the future than his other books in the field of action is much broader

27:50.720 --> 27:55.760
but it's typically Hogan and his credibility. If you haven't been exposed to James P. Hogan's brand

27:55.760 --> 28:07.440
of science fiction you're missing something. This has been the science fiction radio show

28:07.440 --> 28:12.100
production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa

28:12.100 --> 28:13.560
College in Odessa, Texas.
