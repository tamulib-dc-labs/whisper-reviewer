00:01.180 --> 00:02.240
This is Daryl Lane.

00:02.520 --> 00:03.340
And this is Bill Vernon.

00:03.700 --> 00:06.560
And we'll be talking with some prominent authors about the New Wave in science fiction.

00:06.920 --> 00:11.400
The New Wave, which began in the mid-1960s, was simply a New Wave writing science fiction.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.880
Yes, and that newness was seen in many areas.

00:14.420 --> 00:16.940
There was often something unusual, for instance, about the style.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.480
Character and psychology were given much more emphasis.

00:20.180 --> 00:24.620
And also the New Wave treated themes such as sex and religion that science fiction hadn't really touched before.

00:25.020 --> 00:25.280
Right.

00:25.280 --> 00:30.020
And the authors who wrote about these themes were interested in changing the traditional science fiction formulas

00:30.020 --> 00:34.000
which had been around since the pulp era of the 1920s, 30s, and 40s.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.480
You know that type of story.

00:35.880 --> 00:41.200
It's one in which science is glorified and the hero rescues earth from hordes of menacing, bug-eyed monsters.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.900
Frederick Paul, who's been an author, an editor, and an agent in the field of science fiction,

00:47.280 --> 00:48.960
has a few things to say about that change.

00:49.840 --> 00:59.100
New Wave was an attempt, I guess, 15 years ago or more of a number of writers to break away from the traditional kinds of science fiction.

00:59.420 --> 01:01.760
In fact, most of them didn't want to call it science fiction anymore.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.560
They didn't want to call it speculative fiction or call it nothing at all.

01:06.200 --> 01:12.300
And they were interested primarily in writing about interspaces rather than outer space,

01:12.580 --> 01:18.060
and secondarily, a lot of them in things like the drug culture and rock music and so on.

01:18.060 --> 01:25.420
But in the rather bitter internal struggle that went on in science fiction,

01:25.680 --> 01:27.840
a lot of people take sides one way or the other.

01:28.560 --> 01:30.180
I think everyone was deeply affected.

01:30.880 --> 01:36.360
We'll need to remember here that New Wave wasn't really a planned and deliberate movement by a unified group of writers.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.360
One of the principal proponents of the New Wave, author Norman Spinrad,

01:40.840 --> 01:43.440
believes it was just a bunch of diverse writers doing their own thing.

01:43.440 --> 01:49.080
It was an old way, but there was never as a coherent philosophy in school of science fiction,

01:49.120 --> 01:51.700
but there was never a New Wave in the same sense.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.020
There were a lot of ways.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.120
There were a lot of different people doing a lot of different things.

01:56.060 --> 01:58.620
The people that were identified as New Wave were very diverse.

01:59.280 --> 02:06.300
What I was actually writing is very different to what Tom Dish was writing, or Boulard, or Zalazny and Delaney,

02:06.400 --> 02:08.000
were also identified as New Wave writers.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.880
This stuff is much more, you know, Zalazny and Delaney and myself and Boulard and all this and Mike.

02:16.980 --> 02:25.140
We were all, there were more differences between our work than between our work taking us to the talkality and the old stuff.

02:25.640 --> 02:30.100
There was more difference within the so-called New Wave than there was within the so-called old wave.

02:30.660 --> 02:34.660
But Spinrad also thinks the New Wave was tightly connected to what was happening in society.

02:34.660 --> 02:37.820
And of course this mirrored the cultural appointment at the time.

02:37.980 --> 02:43.540
It mirrored what was happening politically, it mirrored what was happening in music, it mirrored what was happening in movies.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.960
It was a phenomenon that went through the western civilizations, a whole.

02:48.780 --> 02:51.300
Some authors maintain that the New Wave is now dead.

02:51.860 --> 02:57.420
Five-time Hugo winner Larry Niven, the author of Ring World, thinks there's a good reason for its demise.

02:57.420 --> 03:05.760
The New Wave is a very persuasive thing and very easy to use to justify bad stories.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.400
I think that's what killed it.

03:08.880 --> 03:20.680
Not that increased characterization and experiments with typography and story format are a bad thing in themselves,

03:20.860 --> 03:24.620
but it's so easy to use New Wave to justify a bad story.

03:24.620 --> 03:27.020
It was bound to collapse.

03:33.400 --> 03:39.720
That may be so, but lots of others feel that the influence of the New Wave is still around, though its presence isn't as intense as before.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.780
It's left its mark on the field, no doubt about that.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.720
Science fiction has been broadened, maybe enhanced somehow because of it.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.480
Frederick Paul states it well.

03:49.100 --> 03:56.480
And the New Wave, if nothing else, taught a bunch of old dinosaurs like Asimov and Heinlein and Meeth,

03:57.280 --> 04:00.520
that there were nontraditional ways of constructing a novel.

04:00.980 --> 04:04.720
See, most of us had grown up when science fiction was in the pulp magazines,

04:04.840 --> 04:08.580
and most of it was written according to some variant of the pulp formula.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.780
It turned out that wasn't necessary.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.020
And I think the New Wave is responsible for teaching us that.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.520
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

04:24.820 --> 04:27.460
production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

04:27.700 --> 04:30.580
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:26.740 --> 05:29.680
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane and David Kershan.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.540
Of all the themes handled by science fiction authors,

05:32.920 --> 05:36.360
that of alien contact has been one of the most consistently popular and fascinating.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.100
For a good reason, too.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.840
Aliens have always been one of the biggest attractions of science fiction.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.220
Whether they be the hostile bug-eyed monsters of the old pulp magazines

05:45.220 --> 05:47.660
or the friendly creatures of close encounters of the third kind.

05:47.660 --> 05:52.340
And they become even more fascinating when you find them in what some people call a first contact story.

05:52.880 --> 05:57.560
First contact, as the term implies, describes the very first meeting between humans and an alien species.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.840
In the past, stories of alien contact were usually written as thrillers,

06:02.120 --> 06:04.780
with the sole and simple intention of scaring readers.

06:05.320 --> 06:09.360
H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds is probably the best example of that type of story.

06:09.860 --> 06:10.820
But that's changed.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.560
Many contemporary writers have provided more thoughtful treatments of aliens,

06:14.560 --> 06:18.240
deepening the realism and the significance of narratives of alien contact.

06:18.740 --> 06:22.240
Of course, before you can have a story of alien contact, you must first have some aliens.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.980
One of the most provocative descriptions of aliens in all of science fiction

06:25.980 --> 06:28.900
is found in Larry Niven's and Jerry Pranell's The Mote in God's Eye,

06:29.320 --> 06:32.060
considered by many to be the finest of all first contact stories.

06:32.580 --> 06:37.220
The success of this book is largely due to the unique and ingenious aliens, the Motees,

06:37.480 --> 06:39.000
the Niven created for the story.

06:39.520 --> 06:43.520
It's interesting, though, that Niven says he doesn't really create aliens for a story,

06:43.520 --> 06:45.660
but suggests that it's the other way around.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.160
But I always design aliens for themselves.

06:50.540 --> 06:54.480
I almost never design an alien to match a story.

06:55.140 --> 06:59.720
The story, some story, will eventually include the alien.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.700
The alien stands for itself.

07:02.540 --> 07:06.320
There are two particularly fascinating things that Niven incorporated into these Motees.

07:06.780 --> 07:08.300
One is the fact that they are not symmetrical.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.760
They have a head, torso, legs, and arms, as humans do,

07:11.760 --> 07:13.600
but the arms are disproportionate.

07:13.980 --> 07:16.240
One is small and thin, and the other is large and powerful.

07:16.760 --> 07:21.140
Right. Niven says he took that idea from studying the structures of living creatures on Earth.

07:21.760 --> 07:30.260
In that case, I had the idea that I was following a progression with a protozoan with an amoeba.

07:30.780 --> 07:33.800
You get radial symmetry inside and out.

07:35.020 --> 07:40.980
You move up a goodly distance, and you find starfishes with radial symmetry on the outside

07:40.980 --> 07:43.080
and bilateral symmetry on the inside.

07:43.340 --> 07:48.400
You move up a little further, and you find flat worms and worms of all stents.

07:49.420 --> 07:53.180
At the level of bilateral symmetry inside and out.

07:53.820 --> 07:58.120
Go as far as a human, and you find bilateral symmetry on the outside,

07:58.120 --> 08:03.500
and no symmetry, well, half symmetrical on the inside.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.000
The lungs look symmetrical, the kidneys look symmetrical,

08:07.560 --> 08:10.780
the intestines look like somebody dropped a plate of spaghetti.

08:11.340 --> 08:13.860
I tried to move on to the next step,

08:16.900 --> 08:19.460
bilaterally unsymmetrical on the outside,

08:20.040 --> 08:23.960
and I got the original Motee, which was the engineer's one.

08:23.960 --> 08:28.360
The other ingenious idea Niven developed for the Motees is the way they construct and use machines.

08:29.020 --> 08:34.120
They're highly skilled tool users, but they have no standard pre-manufactured machines, parts, or tools.

08:34.740 --> 08:38.560
They simply alter or reshape whatever they find around them at the time to suit their needs.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.680
And Niven says that particular idea just came to him.

08:42.180 --> 08:43.600
It seemed interesting and even logical.

08:44.440 --> 08:49.640
I was just playing with the ideas at that point, and that one seemed like a fun one.

08:49.640 --> 08:57.020
It also seemed likely enough, if you've got a critter with not much intelligence

08:57.020 --> 09:02.880
except in the direction of toolmaking and tool altering, then why not?

09:03.780 --> 09:08.720
The thing has to keep testing its ability, or it will lose it.

09:09.320 --> 09:13.980
It might as well be designing something every time it needs a specific machine.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.000
Besides the ingenuity Niven demonstrated in creating the Motees,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.900
he and Purnell also used some unexpected twists into the first contact theme.

09:22.640 --> 09:27.480
A reader interested in alien contact cannot afford to overlook the Motee in God's eye.

09:34.180 --> 09:36.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

09:37.060 --> 09:39.640
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

09:39.640 --> 09:42.780
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

10:52.160 --> 10:57.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.680
And here are your hosts.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.860
This is David Cruz. Today we begin an interview with author Larry Niven.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.080
Even a casual reader of science fiction, if asked to name his favorite authors,

11:19.540 --> 11:21.680
would almost certainly mention the name of Larry Niven.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.860
Niven's popularity rests on a solid and extensive body of work,

11:25.980 --> 11:29.200
but one particular novel seems to have captivated science fiction fans.

11:29.800 --> 11:35.340
That casual reader who named Niven as one of his favorite authors would likely pick Ringworld as Niven's finest work.

11:36.140 --> 11:39.800
The Ringworld is an immense ring, large enough to hold three million Earths.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.800
It has a thousand mile high wall on each side to hold in its atmosphere.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.540
It has continents and oceans.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.100
The Ringworld contains trillions of inhabitants of different species

11:49.100 --> 11:51.660
and derives energy from the sun at its center.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.920
Niven recalls where he obtained the idea for such a fantastic structure.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.840
Suddenly I ran across an article about Dyson Spears.

12:13.100 --> 12:19.960
A picture of that is a golf ball 93 million miles in radius with a sun at the center.

12:20.800 --> 12:25.580
And gravity generators all around the outside so he would live on the inside,

12:25.840 --> 12:30.480
terraforming it with oceans and soil and air.

12:31.760 --> 12:35.740
I ran across that and I didn't like it. I thought it could be improved.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.100
And I wound up with the Ringworld.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.020
Readers were fascinated with the Ringworld.

12:41.340 --> 12:44.320
So fascinated in fact that they studied the science behind it

12:44.320 --> 12:48.140
and wrote to Niven about what seemed to be errors or inconsistencies in the theory

12:48.140 --> 12:49.900
and design of the immense artifact.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.700
Column errors and elaborations because some of them don't really fit the errors.

12:55.940 --> 12:59.220
It's just something that hadn't gotten into the original book.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.520
One of the errors was spotted by some MIT students.

13:02.940 --> 13:05.200
It had to do with the instability of the Ringworld.

13:05.200 --> 13:10.360
I suspect that the Ringworld was unstable and I suspect that you need attitude jets.

13:11.020 --> 13:15.180
I was sure that the Ringworld was spinning fast enough to permit

13:15.180 --> 13:18.120
Blizzard RAM jets to be used as attitude jets,

13:18.240 --> 13:20.200
which means you don't have a fuel problem at all.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.640
You're burning the solar wind.

13:23.800 --> 13:28.340
But rapidly some MIT people demonstrated that the Ringworld was unstable

13:28.340 --> 13:32.040
and they were chanting it in the hall at the next Worldcon.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.260
The Ringworld is unstable. The Ringworld is unstable.

13:37.320 --> 13:43.700
It still took about seven years for anyone to figure out the exact numbers for the instability

13:43.700 --> 13:45.260
and they are horrifying.

13:46.880 --> 13:52.900
A major solar flare would have the Ringworld grinding against its sun in five years.

13:53.760 --> 13:58.720
Well, I worked it into a plot. That was one elaboration or error.

13:59.740 --> 14:04.320
Even teenage readers analyzed his Ringworld with a critical scientific eye.

14:05.180 --> 14:08.360
A high school class in Florida got to work on the Ringworld.

14:09.020 --> 14:16.860
And their conclusion was that the Ringworld's worst problem is that all the top soil would wind up in the oceans in about 3,000 years.

14:17.540 --> 14:21.980
There are no earthquakes on the Ringworld. No mountain building forces.

14:23.160 --> 14:27.740
But in a sequel, Ringworld engineers Niven attempted to correct such deficiencies.

14:27.740 --> 14:31.720
He devised a way to answer the criticism of the Florida high schoolers.

14:33.540 --> 14:42.300
Okay, that's a tough one. I set up a spill pipe system that runs the top, that runs the sea bottom mark from the sea bottoms

14:42.300 --> 14:45.720
under the Ringworld and up over the edge of the Ringwall.

14:47.560 --> 14:57.000
That even allows you some mind accumulation of useful metals.

14:57.880 --> 15:01.220
Fan response of that sort caused Ringworld engineers to be written.

15:01.780 --> 15:05.320
And although Niven once said he wouldn't write any more in the known space series,

15:05.500 --> 15:09.180
the body of stories to which Ringworld belongs, he's not so sure any more.

15:10.060 --> 15:17.640
I've given up saying that the known space series is dating. There's just no point in it.

15:17.760 --> 15:22.160
I've written five books worth of known space stories since I said that.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.360
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

15:31.700 --> 15:34.260
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

15:34.260 --> 15:37.440
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

16:39.180 --> 16:40.580
We'll see you soon with Terry Niven on our next show.

17:00.360 --> 17:06.180
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:09.180 --> 17:10.460
And here are your hosts.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.020
This is David Cruz. Today we continue our interview with author Larry Niven.

17:23.900 --> 17:29.020
Author Larry Niven has produced a body of science fiction that has made him one of the best selling authors in the field.

17:29.660 --> 17:32.980
A fairly large portion of his work falls into the known space series,

17:33.400 --> 17:38.080
a group of stories and novels with a consistent chronology and overall evolving pattern to them.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.680
Such a series is called a Future History.

17:41.360 --> 17:46.200
Niven believes there are some peculiar attractions a Future History has for a science fiction author.

17:46.840 --> 17:53.160
There had been Future Histories around, Poole Anderson and Robert Heinlein.

17:54.960 --> 18:01.240
And I tell you, I guess we each evolved the idea somewhat independently.

18:01.240 --> 18:06.740
And the idea is that if you carved out a consistent, workable future,

18:07.480 --> 18:10.100
it seems a shame to waste it on one story.

18:11.280 --> 18:19.660
You put it in the background because you want the background of a story to seem bigger than it is.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.040
So there are things that are simply unexplained.

18:25.760 --> 18:30.680
And if you think of more to say on a given subject, why you go with it?

18:30.680 --> 18:35.040
And if you think of a story that fits into the background of a previous story

18:35.040 --> 18:39.780
and allows you to elaborate on that background, sometimes you fall in love with the background.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.960
And presently you've got a bunch of stories that link.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.320
Ringworld is probably the best known story in Niven's Future History,

18:47.520 --> 18:51.200
but he's also written some best selling books that fall outside his known space series.

18:51.720 --> 18:57.360
Two of these, The Moat in God's Eye and Lucifer's Hammer, were written in collaboration with Jerry Pornell.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.000
Collaboration for a creative writer presents some problems.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.960
How is the work divided up, for instance?

19:03.420 --> 19:05.240
Is it hard to decide who writes what?

19:05.900 --> 19:09.480
Hard sometimes, but it always resolves.

19:10.280 --> 19:16.940
The question is who is most qualified to write a given scene that we have both decided needs writing?

19:17.780 --> 19:20.740
Before we start, we have the novel all laid out.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.680
We know what's going on virtually everywhere.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.800
And if we don't, it feels like we do.

19:27.660 --> 19:31.160
And if we find out we don't, we elaborate as we get to that section.

19:32.460 --> 19:35.940
Okay, the next question is who is qualified to write a given scene?

19:36.140 --> 19:37.100
Sometimes it's obvious.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.260
If we're dealing with a madman, he's mine.

19:41.020 --> 19:44.340
If we're dealing with military operations, it's Jerry's.

19:44.780 --> 19:46.620
Aliens are generally mine.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.740
Politics is generally Jerry's.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.480
Knowledge of history generally Jerry's.

19:53.480 --> 19:57.980
And a real evil son of a bitch Jerry usually creates him.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.080
And I usually run with him afterwards.

20:02.160 --> 20:07.340
But Niven resists classification, either as an author of future histories or as a collaborator.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.060
He sometimes branches out into seldom entered areas of science fiction.

20:11.540 --> 20:15.060
One of these areas is humor, something few science fiction writers attempt.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.340
What does he think his most successful piece of humor is?

20:18.340 --> 20:27.180
I suppose I could name, oh, man of steel, woman of queen eggs, which has gotten me the most laughs.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.400
I suppose everybody seems to have read it.

20:30.540 --> 20:33.100
And those who haven't have heard about it are cocktail parties.

20:34.080 --> 20:39.460
Niven's ready eye for humor can also be appreciated as he reveals that he's detected one of his own alien creations

20:39.460 --> 20:43.100
from Ringworld, a disguised Pearson's puppeteer here on Earth.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.720
I have reason to suspect the fair puppeteers on Earth.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.480
Look at the characteristics.

20:50.080 --> 20:50.880
Forget the shape.

20:51.020 --> 20:55.500
They must be masters of biology to hide that peculiar three-legged two-headed shape.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.120
But consider their characteristics.

20:58.380 --> 20:59.220
They are cowards.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.260
That is, they want everything utterly safe.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.440
No corners on anything.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.460
Everything is soft surfaces around the puppeteer world.

21:09.340 --> 21:11.880
They don't even keep their world near a sun.

21:11.880 --> 21:16.680
Regarding it is a runaway fusion reactor, which of course it is.

21:18.300 --> 21:26.680
So, desperate regard for safety, they plus an urge to meddle in the lifestyles of other species.

21:27.720 --> 21:33.560
Driving urge to meddle with practically no restraints attached.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.420
What does that remind you of?

21:36.080 --> 21:39.640
It seems nearly certain to me that Ralph Nader is a Pearson's puppeteer.

21:46.580 --> 21:49.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

21:49.460 --> 21:52.040
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

21:52.040 --> 21:55.200
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.680
