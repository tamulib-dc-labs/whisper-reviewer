Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.180 --> 00:33.520
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.860
And here are your hosts.

00:42.040 --> 00:49.600
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. Donald A. Wollheim is one of the versatile
talents that science fiction occasionally produces. He's an author, editor,

00:49.800 --> 00:56.620
critic, and publisher of science fiction. And his influence on the field has
been immense. He became involved in science fiction back in the early 30s, and

00:56.620 --> 01:03.960
many of the things he did had not been done before. He and Forrest Ackerman can
be given much of the credit for starting fandom in the 1930s, for instance. And

01:03.960 --> 01:12.200
as an editor, he's been an innovator and creator many times over. In 1972,
Wollheim founded DAW Books, the first mass-market publishing house devoted

01:12.200 --> 01:20.020
entirely to science fiction. The word DAW, of course, comes from the initials of
Donald A. Wollheim's name. When we spoke with Wollheim, we asked him if he would

01:20.020 --> 01:29.220
tell us about the beginning of DAW Books. Well, you know, I had been with Ace
Books for 19 and a half years. In fact, I was responsible for the founding of

01:29.220 --> 01:39.900
the company, though I didn't own it. And after the death of A. A. Wyn, who was
his original publisher and owner, it passed into the hands of a group of Wall

01:39.900 --> 01:51.000
Street speculators who wanted to build up some kind of a conglomerate in the
communications industry. And unfortunately, they made a number of bad mistakes.

01:51.320 --> 02:02.740
And in about three years, the company was run downhill to where they were in
rather bad financial straits. And it was at that point, when it looked as if we

02:02.740 --> 02:11.640
were likely to have our doors closed at any minute or any day, that I got
together and we talked, you know, I was thinking of the chance to get out and

02:11.640 --> 02:19.900
start my own line. And the man who was the printer for Ace Books came to me and
said, You know, this is getting ridiculous. They owed him months and months of

02:19.900 --> 02:30.160
payment. He said, why don't we break loose and start our own company? Well,
actually, that's put the idea in my head. But I didn't go into partnership with

02:30.160 --> 02:43.740
him. What I did is scout around and we were able to successfully leave Ace and
launch our own company under our name, DAW Books, which is based on my initials.

02:44.420 --> 02:53.640
Wollheim actually neither prints or markets his books. We made a very fine
arrangement with the New American Library that publishes the Signet Books for

02:53.640 --> 03:04.720
distribution and for co-partnership, which means that, in a sense, I feed into
their operations. I am my own editor, my own publisher. I'm an independent

03:04.720 --> 03:14.180
corporation. But they do our printing, they do our marketing and distribution
and handle the minor details. And, of course, we pay them for this. But it's

03:14.180 --> 03:23.200
been a very profitable partnership between us. Wollheim's wife, Elsie, helps him
run DAW Books, so it's sort of a family affair. The odd thing about that was

03:23.200 --> 03:33.740
that originally my secretary from Ace Books was going to come over with me. But
she got a little panicky and was afraid to leave an established job for one

03:33.740 --> 03:44.340
which was insecure, and she didn't come. Instead, my wife, who had, many years
ago before she married me, been president of her own small corporation in the

03:44.340 --> 03:54.720
manufacturing jewelry industry, knew the odds and ends of bookkeeping and
management of her business, instead, you know, came with me. So she's working as

03:54.720 --> 04:03.420
my executive vice president. It's worked out marvelously. We're a husband and
wife team that is really becoming one of the wonders of the industry. We asked

04:03.420 --> 04:13.920
Wollheim how many books he puts out each year. We do four new titles a month,
plus one full reissue of an old title that is sold well and is going out of

04:13.920 --> 04:26.660
stock. That means five releases, actually. But as far as new titles are
concerned, we do approximately 60. That may be novels, reprints of hardcover

04:26.660 --> 04:38.960
books, or new editions of books that have been sold out from other publishers
and are now available again, or anthologies, or some of our annuals. We do

04:38.960 --> 04:49.760
several annuals, the Year's Best Horror, Year's Best Fantasy, and my own annual
World's Best Science Fiction collections. That's always been one of our

04:49.760 --> 04:52.720
mainstays. More with Donald A. Wollheim next time.

04:59.560 --> 05:07.540
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show. A production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:07.540 --> 05:08.280
Odessa, Texas.

06:01.740 --> 06:05.660
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:21.320 --> 06:26.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.020
And here are your hosts.

06:34.880 --> 06:42.480
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. We're talking with Donald A. Wollheim,
science fiction author, editor, and presently the publisher of DAW Science

06:42.480 --> 06:50.760
Fiction Books. DAW Books is the only mass publisher devoted entirely to science
fiction, and the company puts out some 60 titles each year. We asked Wollheim how

06:50.760 --> 07:00.960
he selects the books he'll publish. Is there a certain kind of story he looks
for? Well, actually, we try to be as varied as possible, but I go on the premise

07:00.960 --> 07:11.740
in which I've always operated as an editor. If I like it, I publish it. This is
something which I sort of developed over the years. I've been almost 40 years as

07:11.740 --> 07:22.280
an editor. And I discovered that by good luck or bad luck or whatever you have
it, I seem to be, what I like seems to be liked by at least 75% of the potential

07:22.280 --> 07:30.780
readers. So maybe I have good taste, maybe I have bad taste. I don't honestly
know, but all I know is that what I like, I will find that my readers will

07:30.780 --> 07:44.540
generally like. So in science fiction, I like some good hardcore science
fiction. I also like good adventure, the sort of Edgar Rice Burroughs type. We

07:44.540 --> 07:56.900
do a series like that by Dray Prescott. And I like fantasy if it's nicely done.
And I'm really quite, quite wide open in my taste.

08:06.840 --> 08:14.200
Wollheim is noted as an editor and publisher who can spot new talent. In his over
40 years as an editor, he's been responsible for introducing many of today's big

08:14.200 --> 08:21.280
-name writers to the field. Two of his fortunate finds at DAW Books have been C.
 J. Cherryh and Tanith Lee, both of whom published their first novels for

08:21.280 --> 08:31.800
Wollheim. We asked him how he locates writers of that caliber. Do they seek him
out, or does he go looking for them? Both ways, actually. We have an established

08:31.800 --> 08:38.980
image. People know what DAW Books are like. They know what they can expect. We
have a lot of people who are faithful readers because they feel that almost

08:38.980 --> 08:47.780
every book that they buy, regardless of who writes it, is going to be something
they like because their tastes are obviously similar to mine. We pride ourselves

08:47.780 --> 08:56.780
of being one of the very, very few companies that actually looks at and reads
every unsolicited manuscript that comes in. We don't read it all the way

08:56.780 --> 09:05.160
through, but we look at it. Nothing goes through here without being inspected
and read, if it's possible. Now, that's how we find new authors. We found C. J.

09:05.300 --> 09:17.620
Cherryh there. We found Tanith Lee that way. We found many other authors, Michael
Foster and Doris Berserky and so on, Jo Clayton. They are people we found. But

09:17.620 --> 09:24.340
they submitted to us in the first place because they thought we were the kind of
publisher that was doing the kind of book they were writing. And if we both

09:24.340 --> 09:25.820
agree, they're great.

09:33.080 --> 09:43.140
We asked Wollheim if he ever suggests changes in an author's manuscript before
he'll publish it. In a few instances, we will suggest changes, but I don't

09:43.140 --> 09:54.160
really like that system. I pride myself on the fact that the people who become
more or less regular contributors have gotten to know what I like, and what I

09:54.160 --> 10:04.280
like is usually what they like. So we have a situation where I don't have to
tell many authors to rewrite or anything like that. If it's a project, of

10:04.280 --> 10:14.160
course, we'll discuss the possible turns of it before the thing is even written.
But if it's a complete manuscript and I've read it and I like it, great. I do

10:14.160 --> 10:24.480
very little, actually, in that sense of making an author revise and revise. What
about suggesting to an author that he write a sequel or expand a novel into a

10:24.480 --> 10:35.580
trilogy? I usually do not. This is something that authors themselves come up
with. Authors dream of trilogies, and they will submit the first novel

10:35.580 --> 10:43.740
and say there are two more sequels. If I agree with it, I don't mind. We'll
continue our conversation with Donald A. Wollheim on our next show.

10:50.520 --> 10:58.360
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:58.360 --> 10:59.100

11:30.580 --> 11:30.760


11:45.680 --> 11:49.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:05.280 --> 12:10.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:13.260 --> 12:14.940
And here are your hosts.

12:19.120 --> 12:25.800
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon. Have you ever wondered what goes into the
making of the science fiction paperback you just bought? You know that somebody

12:25.800 --> 12:33.380
wrote it, and that some business enterprise printed it, but you probably don't
think much beyond those general facts. It takes eight months, usually, for the

12:33.380 --> 12:41.580
typical paperback to complete the publishing cycle, and a lot happens in that
time. When we spoke with Donald A. Wollheim, a pioneer fan, author, and editor of

12:41.580 --> 12:48.860
science fiction, and now the publisher of DAW Science Fiction Books, we asked
him if he would trace the publishing process through for us, beginning at the

12:48.860 --> 12:59.520
moment he receives a manuscript. Well, of course. As I said, I have a schedule
of eight months ahead. Now, at the point that I write the manuscript, what I do

12:59.520 --> 13:08.840
then is contact the author or the author's agent, whoever submitted it, and
discuss contract, and then we'll make up the contract which we sent to the

13:08.840 --> 13:19.000
author to be signed. We'll pay out the initial advance on that, and that will
take about anywhere from three weeks to a month, and we put it in our inventory.

13:19.580 --> 13:30.740
The next step is selecting an artist for the cover. Wollheim has an interesting
method for that. If the book is on schedule, within about, well, let's say,

13:31.400 --> 13:42.620
within about two months or three months, I will take the manuscript, and have it
copied, have it Xeroxed, and give a copy to an artist that I think would do the

13:42.620 --> 13:53.180
cover, the right cover for it. A number of different cover artists, and some do
better at certain types of stories than others. I prefer my artists to read the

13:53.180 --> 14:01.540
manuscript. I prefer them to be actually science fiction readers to enjoy the
subject, and they usually do. So if they get a cover, they get a manuscript,

14:01.980 --> 14:10.040
they will then have approximately one month to turn in the finished cover. What
they will do is read it, and then they will sketch out some possible covers,

14:10.180 --> 14:21.180
bring in the sketches. We will okay one of them on guest changes, and they will
have another couple of weeks to turn in the complete painting, which would be

14:21.180 --> 14:30.220
available at the end of that month. At that same time, we would then have to do
and put together the copy for the cover, the material on the back cover, the

14:30.220 --> 14:42.920
titles and all that, which goes out to an agency that
does the layouts and type and all that. Then comes the important job of reading

14:42.920 --> 14:53.340
the manuscript to locate and correct errors. Meanwhile, we then have a month in
which the book must be copy edited. That goes to an editor who goes over the

14:53.340 --> 15:03.540
manuscript, making corrections, correcting spelling, correcting punctuation,
making any minor changes that might be necessary. And I say minor because any

15:03.540 --> 15:15.180
major change would be done by the author, never by the copy editor. So a month
later, that manuscript would then go out to production.

15:16.740 --> 15:25.100
Production, as a man, this would go through the American Library, you
understand. But there's a man there who was an old friend of mine who worked for

15:25.100 --> 15:35.420
me at Ace and who's working for the New American Library now. He will design the
book. He will determine the size type, the layout of the title page, the layout

15:35.420 --> 15:50.600
of pages, and will send it off to the printers. And we will next see in about
anywhere from two to five weeks the galleys and proofs of the front. And by

15:50.600 --> 16:03.480
that time, it would be out a month ago. And the next thing we saw after that
would be the book itself. This just stretches out. So we're about five months

16:03.480 --> 16:14.020
involved in the actual production. But it's a leisurely pace. It stretches out.
It works in very mechanically. And it just runs along. The paperback finally

16:14.020 --> 16:21.260
shows up in a bookstore or supermarket, of course. And in the case of DAW Books,
it will be noticeable. That's because all DAW Books have bright yellow spines,

16:21.440 --> 16:28.740
so they'll stand out in the science fiction section of the bookstore. And a lot
of intricate professional work lies behind that spine. We'll talk again with Donald

16:28.740 --> 16:29.940
A. Wollheim on our next show.

16:37.000 --> 16:44.800
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:44.800 --> 16:51.400
Odessa, Texas. 

16:51.400 --> 16:56.960


16:56.960 --> 17:15.420


17:31.800 --> 17:35.700
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:51.360 --> 17:56.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:59.340 --> 18:01.060
And here are your hosts.

18:05.060 --> 18:13.420
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. Since its inception in 1972, DAW Books has
published some of the best science fiction being written today. For the founder

18:13.420 --> 18:20.700
of DAW Books, Donald A. Wollheim, it's been a satisfying and successful venture.
So successful, in fact, that some people have wondered why DAW Books doesn't try

18:20.700 --> 18:30.260
hardback books in addition to the paperbacks it exclusively publishes. Wollheim
tells us why not. There are a couple of reasons for that. For one thing, I don't

18:30.260 --> 18:46.600
know the hardback field. I have, well, I've been an editor of pulp magazines and
of paperback books, newsstand distributed books, since 1941. The New York Times

18:46.600 --> 18:54.700
called me the dean of paperback editors. But to be frank, I have never been an
editor of hardcover books. It's a somewhat different field. The marketing

18:54.700 --> 19:04.200
situation is different. The pricing situation is different. I would be sort of
an amateur. And I don't believe in sticking my neck out into a field in which I

19:04.200 --> 19:14.600
really don't know what I'm doing. Now, I could, of course, make an arrangement
with a hardcover publisher. But I don't see it. I don't believe that a hardcover

19:14.600 --> 19:26.000
book sells that well. You print, well, after all, in paperback, you print by the
tens of thousands of copies. In hardcover, you print what? 3,000 copies? 5,000?

19:26.100 --> 19:34.720
Perhaps 7,000? So a hardcover editor comes in and says, gee, I've got a great
item. It sells 4,000 copies. Well, that's a joke to me. All right, there's money

19:34.720 --> 19:46.340
in it. But I don't need the headache. I don't want it. I don't see it. Other
companies apparently do these things successfully. But that's because they're

19:46.340 --> 19:54.080
probably connected up with a hardcover publisher, people who know their
business. I simply don't feel that I wish to get involved.

20:04.440 --> 20:13.300
We asked Wollheim how many copies a paperback science fiction book would have to
sell before it generated a reasonable profit? That is very difficult to answer

20:13.300 --> 20:24.540
because it would depend on the size of the book and the price of the book. But
very roughly, the average non-bestseller, say, book in the science fiction

20:24.540 --> 20:35.740
fantasy category, may do well at 30,000 copies. In other words, by that point,
it will have cleared its course and made a small profit. Obviously, if it makes

20:35.740 --> 20:50.000
50,000, not 60,000, 75,000 or 100,000, it's great. But the margin is quite low,
surprisingly enough. And so it is not as risky as you may think. Finally,

20:50.240 --> 20:56.940
something of concern to all readers, what about the escalating prices of
paperbacks? How long before high prices make a real difference and begin to hurt

20:56.940 --> 21:05.460
readers? I think it does make a difference. It hasn't affected science fiction,
I think, because we have a very ardent audience. And in general, paperbacks are

21:05.460 --> 21:14.140
holding up much better than most of the book industry. But it does make a
difference. The question of how far prices can go up is something I couldn't

21:14.140 --> 21:24.180
answer you because this is, you know, economic speculation. Who in heck knows? I
mean, nobody, nobody can guess what the economy is. We all hope that the

21:24.180 --> 21:33.660
inflation will stop. And maybe it will. But if it doesn't, why, prices have to
go up accordingly because of the cost of paper, the cost of printers, the cost

21:33.660 --> 21:41.760
of binding, the cost of distribution, the cost of marketing, everything goes up.
And you've got to, you've got to raise your price accordingly or you're, it's

21:41.760 --> 21:52.440
impossible to do business. We do try very hard to be conservative about pricing.
We try to hold it back. We have discussions pretty regularly. I will sometimes

21:52.440 --> 22:00.220
suggest that a book should be, let us say, $2.50. And we'll have the head of
marketing will come in and say, can't you make it $2.25 because you'd like to

22:00.220 --> 22:09.820
hold this down? And if it's practical, we will. If it's not practical, I can't.
But the truth is that nobody wants to raise these prices. But we, you know, you

22:09.820 --> 22:16.440
get pressed. Like anybody in any industry. We'll conclude our discussion with
Donald A. Wollheim on our next show.

22:23.240 --> 22:31.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin

This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.740
And here are your hosts.

23:55.580 --> 24:04.040
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. DAW Books, publishing some of today's most
popular authors. We asked Donald A. Wollheim, founder and editor of DAW Books,

24:04.220 --> 24:17.360
whose best-selling authors are. Well, our best-sellers are the John Norman Gor
books, Andre Norton's novels, C. J. Cherryh does very nicely, Tanith Lee goes

24:17.360 --> 24:31.680
back to press pretty continuously, and let's see, well, we have quite a number
that do very nicely. Marion Zimmer Bradley, for instance, is always short, kept

24:31.680 --> 24:43.420
continuously in print. We do the Mike Moorcock books, and they're continuously
in print. We do, well, many titles of that sort. So, our best-seller is John

24:43.420 --> 24:54.920
Norman, of course. He sells by half a million at a book, and constantly in
print. In addition to books by individual authors, DAW Books also publishes many

24:54.920 --> 25:04.000
anthologies each year. The best-known as DAW's annual The World's Best Science
Fiction, published each year since DAW Books' inception in 1972. We asked

25:04.000 --> 25:14.600
Wollheim if he selected the stories in his anthologies himself. Uh, yes. It's a
tough cure, and I work with Arthur Saha, who is an old-time science fiction fan

25:14.600 --> 25:24.720
and a determined reader of everything that comes out. And so Saha does the first
reading and sorts out the junk from the good ones and gives me a list of what he

25:24.720 --> 25:36.760
thinks I should read. Well, that saves me an awful lot of work, and I sort
through his recommended list, and finally, we arrive at a, what we consider the

25:36.760 --> 25:49.120
ten best, and that creates our annual. Does he have any criteria he goes by?
Yeah, if I like the story. Basically, of course, it also is the originality of

25:49.120 --> 25:59.500
concept and originality of plot, and of course, how well it's written. All these
factors come into play. Generally speaking, if it's got a really original idea,

25:59.900 --> 26:08.960
I would be strongly in favor of it. Unfortunately, science fiction being what it
is, not too many will come up with original ideas these days. We asked Wollheim

26:08.960 --> 26:20.640
to tell us about some of the other anthologies DAW Books puts out, and we also
asked if his anthologies sold well. For us, they sell quite well. We have no

26:20.640 --> 26:31.960
problems with the annual. We reissue it, usually four years later, as Wollheim's
World's Best Series five or four or six, because you can't have a dated book. A

26:31.960 --> 26:44.320
dated book prejudices your dealers. So our 1982 annual, which is coming out in a
couple of months, of course, covers the best in 1981. Other books, like the

26:44.320 --> 26:57.020
Year's Best Horror Stories, being edited for us by Karl Edward Wagner, who is
himself a good name and a good writer in that field. Year's Best Fantasy, used

26:57.020 --> 27:01.440
to be edited for us by Lin Carter, but now is being handled by Arthur Saha
directly.

27:04.460 --> 27:17.420
And Isaac Asimov is doing an encyclopedic study of the early days, beginning
with 1939 and working up to the present in about two books a year, called Asimov

27:17.420 --> 27:30.980
Presents the Great SF Stories. And I did one volume of Terra SF, which was the
best stories from Western Europe, which was edited for me by a French science

27:30.980 --> 27:40.960
fiction fan that's familiar with the field and managed to arrange to get
translations from all over Western Europe. I will probably continue that on a

27:40.960 --> 27:51.640
once-every-two-years basis. So it works. Wollheim has had a career in science
fiction that's lasted over 50 years. In all aspects of science fiction, he's one

27:51.640 --> 27:59.840
of the pioneers of the field. He's been a fan, an author, a critic, an editor,
and now, with DAW Books, a publisher. As with few others, he's devoted his life

27:59.840 --> 28:02.540
to science fiction and left an indelible mark on the field.

28:09.600 --> 28:17.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

28:17.500 --> 28:18.260
Odessa, Texas.

28:38.660 --> 28:41.460
