00:09.040 --> 00:13.000
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.760 --> 00:34.100
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.540 --> 00:38.380
And here are your hosts.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.620
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.840 --> 00:48.120
Here is Anthony as the author of over 30 science fiction and fantasy novels.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.060
His science fiction novels include Thone, Macroscope and the Omnivore series.

00:52.580 --> 00:56.060
Anthony's fantasy novels include Hassan and the well-known Xanth series.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.420
He's also written what he calls Science Fantasy.

00:58.920 --> 01:02.960
The best examples of this genre are his cluster novels and the associated three-volume tarot

01:02.960 --> 01:03.220
novel.

01:03.220 --> 01:07.260
Since Anthony writes both science fiction and fantasy, we ask him which one he prefers

01:07.260 --> 01:07.740
to write.

01:07.740 --> 01:14.240
For the challenge, for the sheer joy of getting in and tackling a difficult problem and surmounting

01:14.240 --> 01:16.580
it, science fiction is better.

01:18.380 --> 01:22.380
But if I need money, it's fantasy.

01:22.980 --> 01:26.020
I make my money on fantasy and it's very easy to do.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.520
So that it depends on what I really want.

01:30.620 --> 01:36.000
If I want to do something that I will feel will live after me and really be worth my

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
effort, then it is science fiction.

01:39.260 --> 01:44.020
But right now I would say about three quarters of my money is being made in a fantasy.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.900
So that it is a certain pleasure to be able to do something like that and just be richly

01:48.900 --> 01:49.900
rewarded for it.

01:50.340 --> 01:56.280
Not so much intellectually, but I can't just ignore the financial aspect.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.100
It's nice to be paid well as well.

01:58.860 --> 02:02.320
But once he starts writing on either genre, Anthony admits he enjoys it.

02:02.980 --> 02:06.640
Actually, I do enjoy each when I get into it.

02:07.900 --> 02:14.440
Whatever a genre or whatever project I get into, I do the very best I can and generally

02:16.600 --> 02:22.040
satisfied that I've done the best that I can in that particular genre.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.860
There are different thrusts, you might say.

02:25.660 --> 02:29.620
Right now, Anthony's fantasy commands a much larger audience than does his science fiction.

02:30.400 --> 02:37.420
For the decade or so that I wrote science fiction before I got into fantasy in any big way,

02:38.200 --> 02:45.500
I would have sales of 50,000, 60,000 copies, 100,000, and some over the years some of my

02:45.500 --> 02:47.440
better ones would build up beyond that.

02:47.940 --> 02:54.140
I've only been into fantasy for the past five years and they're already selling in the

02:54.140 --> 02:57.540
quarter million copies of class.

02:57.540 --> 03:06.680
I think my first recent fantasy, a spell for chameleon, has now sold about 280,000 copies.

03:07.260 --> 03:11.900
So it's just much, much bigger than the science fiction, much faster and much more.

03:12.980 --> 03:16.580
We ask Anthony what reason he gives for the popularity of fantasy in general these days.

03:17.340 --> 03:20.740
That's something that a lot of people are speculating on now.

03:21.480 --> 03:25.340
And my answer may be fairly simple and others may not agree with it.

03:25.340 --> 03:30.180
For a number of years there simply wasn't much market for fantasy and everybody knew it

03:30.180 --> 03:31.240
so nobody wrote it.

03:32.520 --> 03:38.100
Delray Books decided to take a plunge and get into fantasy in a big way.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.860
They went out and they tried to get new authors, they tried to get old ones to convert over

03:43.980 --> 03:46.780
and do serious, well-written fantasy.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.660
I was one of the ones that shifted over from science fiction to fantasy.

03:50.660 --> 03:57.980
And apparently it worked because now most of the best-selling fantasy is with this one publisher, Delray Books.

03:59.060 --> 04:03.580
I conjecture that they took the plunge and it worked.

04:04.020 --> 04:10.840
That when fantasy was given the same push as science fiction was, it had the same success and now is being carried on

04:10.840 --> 04:16.500
perhaps on momentum beyond the science fiction level.

04:16.500 --> 04:24.880
Now most people will tell you there's a deep philosophical aspect that somehow people crave fantasy when they don't crave science fiction

04:24.880 --> 04:34.760
but I don't see that the world has changed that much in five years to make people suddenly crave a genre that they didn't want before.

04:35.240 --> 04:44.240
I think again the answer has to be in the commercial aspect, in the push, in the advertising, in the promotion that they give the novels.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.820
I think people just didn't know about fantasy before.

04:48.680 --> 04:54.880
As I said, this is not an answer most people will give you and I'm not sure whether it's accurate, it's just my theory.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.700
More with Pierce Anthony on our next show.

05:04.840 --> 05:10.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

05:10.120 --> 05:13.300
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.700
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:17.680 --> 06:22.860
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:25.620 --> 06:27.220
And here are your hosts.

06:31.380 --> 06:32.680
This is Daryl Lane.

06:32.780 --> 06:33.460
And the Bill Vernon.

06:33.840 --> 06:39.660
Science Fiction and Fantasy author Pierce Anthony has written the enormously successful fantasy series popularly called the Xanth series.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.680
A Spell for Chameleon appeared in September 1977.

06:43.520 --> 06:50.860
It tells the story of Bink, a young man growing up in the enchanted land of Xanth, who is attempting to discover his unique individual magical ability.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.840
A Spell for Chameleon sets the stage for the succeeding Xanth books.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.820
It is an adventure fantasy loaded with humor, especially puns.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.760
When a Spell for Chameleon appeared in 1977, it was meant to be a standalone novel.

07:02.760 --> 07:12.040
However, as Anthony tells us, he came to write Two Sequels, the source of magic which appeared in February 1979, and Castle Rugna which appeared in July of that year.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.320
The editor also had to write his work.

07:35.940 --> 07:40.940
So before it was published, the editor said, will you do another fantasy for us?

07:41.380 --> 07:45.300
And he was not thinking of another in the same framework, and neither was I.

07:45.860 --> 07:56.540
But when I got to thinking about it and working out and trying to find another fantasy setup, I realized that there was more that I wanted to say about the land of Xanth.

07:56.580 --> 07:57.440
I sort of liked it.

07:57.940 --> 08:01.680
So I asked him if it would be alright to do another one in that framework.

08:02.060 --> 08:07.240
And I think a little bit reluctantly, the editor agreed, and we did it.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.140
And then the thing was almost the best seller.

08:10.340 --> 08:13.500
It did very well, and that pretty well established Xanth as a series.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.220
It just kept on going.

08:15.420 --> 08:18.980
We did a third one, said let's wrap it up as a trilogy and not do any more.

08:19.440 --> 08:23.120
Then the readers started demanding more and more and more and more.

08:23.120 --> 08:27.520
And finally, both the publisher and the author were...

08:28.480 --> 08:31.580
It's hard to say no when the readers are begging for more, really.

08:32.180 --> 08:36.000
And so we have gone along, and it's been very rewarding, actually.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.940
So there's the answer for those who say Pierre Xanthony doesn't know how many books were in a trilogy.

08:41.380 --> 08:43.460
It wasn't his intent to make the Xanth series a trilogy.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.560
At this time, Centaur Isle, Ogre Ogre, and Nightmare have been released, making a total of six in the series.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.840
Anthony told us that the series will probably go on indefinitely.

08:53.140 --> 08:56.100
At the time of the interview, only four Xanth novels had been published.

08:56.660 --> 08:59.000
Well, I think of it as an open-ended series.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.920
I've actually written seven.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.100
I'm finishing the seventh one now. I'm actually typing it right now.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.100
And I have two more that I'm thinking of.

09:10.820 --> 09:14.880
As you see, there are four in print, but there will be two more coming out later this year.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.880
I'm bringing it up to six, and then the seventh will appear about a year later.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.380
And I think as long as the market holds up, as long as there's demand,

09:23.560 --> 09:25.780
I'll probably do one more Xanth novel a year.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.040
Just indefinitely.

09:28.180 --> 09:32.740
When people get tired of Xanth and the sales go down, we'll quit.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.960
So it really has no end, I suspect.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.720
But it may go one novel a year for the next 20 years. I don't know.

09:40.520 --> 09:44.240
As the reader can well imagine, Anthony has a good time writing the Xanth novels.

09:44.720 --> 09:49.240
I say it's not what I regard great literature. It's not terrifically challenging.

09:50.040 --> 09:54.620
But it has two things going for it. One is that it pays very well,

09:54.760 --> 09:59.100
and that's all in a recession like this. It helps to have something you know will pay.

09:59.820 --> 10:02.680
And the other is that it is an awful lot of fun to do.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.000
I can just get there and sort of relax.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.320
You know, it's like being at home with your shoes off and just relaxing and enjoying yourself.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.620
I enjoy it more than just about anything else.

10:13.420 --> 10:20.520
But as I said, I like to do something with challenge so that I don't want to do nothing but Xanth.

10:20.880 --> 10:26.480
But in between other novels, it's very nice to come back and just let myself go

10:26.480 --> 10:30.960
and work out puns that nobody else would tolerate in Xanth.

10:30.960 --> 10:36.180
They're all right. And I probably enjoy writing them as much as my readers enjoy reading them.

10:37.020 --> 10:38.940
More about Piers and Anthony on our next show.

10:45.760 --> 10:48.180
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:48.540 --> 10:51.120
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:51.120 --> 10:54.300
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:43.340 --> 11:46.440
The next episode will be about the science fiction radio show.

11:46.680 --> 11:47.680
Stay with us!

12:03.620 --> 12:08.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.140
And here are your hosts.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.560
This is Bill Vernon.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.440
And Daryl Lane.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.720
Science Fiction and Fantasy author Piers Anthony has over 40 novels to his credit.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.720
One of his best series is the Cluster series, which Anthony calls Science Fantasy.

12:27.720 --> 12:33.100
It began as a designed trilogy comprising Cluster, Chaining the Lady, and Curly and Quest.

12:33.500 --> 12:38.080
But two additional related novels have been added to the list, Thousand Star and Viscous Circle.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.960
Central to this series of novels is the Tarot Religion,

12:41.320 --> 12:45.400
a much more sophisticated version of the Tarot fortune-telling cards which have been around hundreds of years.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.520
Anthony informed us that while he was researching the Cluster novels,

12:48.700 --> 12:51.480
he came across an interesting group who used Tarot cards.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.580
Here he tells us how material he got from that group got included in the Cluster novels.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.900
I was doing the research, see I work ahead.

12:59.560 --> 13:03.680
So I was doing research and looking at things and just studying things in general.

13:04.720 --> 13:10.640
I like to say now I learn more each year than I ever did in school or college, just because I like knowledge.

13:12.200 --> 13:20.720
And so I was working on the Cluster novels at this time, and this material suddenly gave a new direction to it.

13:20.720 --> 13:27.840
So I put in Tarot scenes, one major scene, one chapter in each of the Cluster novels.

13:28.460 --> 13:31.180
It had not originally been there, and I built.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.180
I merged the frameworks.

13:36.300 --> 13:43.080
Tarot is in the Cluster framework, and the Tarot material appears in the Cluster novels.

13:43.600 --> 13:50.120
It was a kind of a meeting, you might say, of two ideas, the Tarot idea and the framework that I had already developed.

13:52.460 --> 13:58.040
When the Cluster trilogy was completed, Anthony digressed to show the origin and original tenets of the Tarot religion.

13:58.620 --> 14:03.080
The books making up this history are God of Tarot, Vision of Tarot, and Faith of Tarot.

14:03.280 --> 14:07.340
But be aware that this is not a trilogy, although some reviewers have called it so.

14:07.660 --> 14:12.680
It is actually one long novel which was broken into three volumes, much to Anthony's displeasure.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.840
It was one quarter million word novel.

14:15.840 --> 14:21.060
I wrote it in one piece, and the publisher's balk at size.

14:21.220 --> 14:25.660
I don't know why in mainstream people can get quarter million word novels published in their best sellers,

14:26.300 --> 14:29.040
but in science fiction they wouldn't do it for me.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.260
They insisted on breaking it up.

14:33.820 --> 14:35.820
Well, my agent and I fought this.

14:36.340 --> 14:40.920
We even went to the extent of taking about a 30% cut in a payment

14:42.000 --> 14:45.640
for the sole reason to have it published as one novel.

14:46.520 --> 14:53.040
So they gave us the, I think they offered $15,000, and they cut it to $11,500 for it,

14:53.340 --> 14:56.500
and signed the agreement that they would publish it as one novel.

14:57.700 --> 15:00.580
Whereupon they broke it up into three.

15:00.760 --> 15:06.040
They didn't give me back the money, and the publisher published the first third of it,

15:06.100 --> 15:07.040
and went out of business.

15:07.040 --> 15:07.900
That was Joe.

15:08.780 --> 15:12.920
Joe was brought out by the combine that, you know, Berkeley was part of.

15:13.620 --> 15:17.220
Berkeley went ahead, published the other two novels in a different year

15:17.220 --> 15:19.940
so that I couldn't even get my novel published in one year.

15:20.540 --> 15:24.340
It bothered me because I feel that this is the major novel of my career.

15:24.860 --> 15:28.000
Split into three parts, and divided between two years.

15:28.780 --> 15:29.820
It washed me out totally.

15:30.020 --> 15:33.020
I had no chance to make a run for any awards or anything like that.

15:33.020 --> 15:38.120
It was simply gone, which is what tends to happen to my more important work.

15:39.920 --> 15:44.440
So I'm rather put out about this because I felt the major work of my career

15:44.440 --> 15:48.140
was virtually destroyed by the publisher.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.260
Not that the publisher set out to do that,

15:50.520 --> 15:53.600
but I mean by the publisher going out of business right in the middle of my novel

15:53.600 --> 15:56.560
by refusing to honor the original commitment.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.820
Part of the agreement was when they finally broke it up,

15:59.820 --> 16:03.300
I had to sign a paper saying, all right, if you've got to break it up, you've got to...

16:03.300 --> 16:07.400
but never will this be referred to as a trilogy, because it's not.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.040
See, I write, when I write a novel, it's complete.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.240
I tie up the loose ends.

16:12.100 --> 16:16.860
And to publish a third of a novel, and then call it a full novel in itself,

16:16.960 --> 16:18.140
that's just not the way I write.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.280
Other people write that way. I'm aware of it. I don't.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.780
I like to wrap up my loose ends.

16:22.780 --> 16:24.700
As it happened, I saw a review of it.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.800
The first third, the reviewer never even realized it was only a third of a novel.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.780
So apparently he's used to seeing these fragments.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.920
More about Pierce Anthony on our next show.

16:40.820 --> 16:43.340
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:43.660 --> 16:46.300
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:46.300 --> 16:49.460
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:26.600 --> 17:27.400
The Science Fiction Radio Show

17:27.400 --> 17:27.780
The program was produced by the University of Odessa

17:29.460 --> 17:31.240
and the University of Odessa University.

17:32.460 --> 17:36.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:52.460 --> 17:55.000
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.740
a commentary on Science Fiction and Fantasy.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.080
And here are your hosts.

18:06.340 --> 18:07.620
This is Daryl Lane.

18:07.780 --> 18:08.400
And Bill Vernon.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.720
Science Fiction and Fantasy author Pierce Anthony

18:10.720 --> 18:12.980
has been writing in these genres since the mid-60s.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.420
Anthony's apparent production was fairly low until 1977

18:16.740 --> 18:19.360
when his work began appearing with increasing frequency.

18:19.940 --> 18:23.480
Right. Since that apparently sudden explosion of effort in 1977,

18:23.480 --> 18:26.440
some 18 Anthony volumes have appeared in print for the first time.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.420
But Anthony did not suddenly begin writing in a brisk or pace.

18:29.780 --> 18:32.560
He told us that he had been blacklisted by the publishing industry

18:32.560 --> 18:35.780
in the early 70s because he had insisted on being paid fairly

18:35.780 --> 18:37.680
for his first published novel, Thone.

18:38.220 --> 18:40.360
The explosion of his works in print in 1977

18:40.360 --> 18:42.840
was a result of his overcoming the blacklisting.

18:43.000 --> 18:43.800
Here Anthony explains.

18:54.180 --> 18:58.100
I'll say 50% of my output was getting into print.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.340
But when I finally got through that,

19:00.500 --> 19:02.500
I finally became apparent to some of these publishers

19:03.060 --> 19:06.220
that I was the one that was right, you see.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.220
See, the word was being spread by the blacklisters

19:10.220 --> 19:12.400
how difficult a writer I was to deal with

19:12.400 --> 19:14.420
and don't deal with this guy and so on.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.300
It's just nothing but trouble.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.340
When I finally, when that passed,

19:19.420 --> 19:21.540
and I got to working with editors who knew me personally

19:21.540 --> 19:26.500
and knew what to sell, then I could sell everything I wrote.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.920
So now you're seeing everything I write

19:28.920 --> 19:30.180
and it looks like an explosion,

19:30.340 --> 19:32.680
but I always was writing at that pace.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.760
I just couldn't get it into print.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.120
Peer's Anthony is actually a known diploma

19:37.120 --> 19:40.000
utilizing only the author's first and second names.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.480
When we asked Anthony why he uses a pen name,

19:42.640 --> 19:44.660
we found out it's due to some long-range planning.

19:45.420 --> 19:48.540
I decided on that before I ever sold a thing

19:49.360 --> 19:51.360
and said, supposing I write,

19:51.640 --> 19:53.380
and just supposing I'm successful

19:53.380 --> 19:56.380
and just supposing I get to be famous.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.280
Oh, this was an awful lot of supposing.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.920
I mean, I hadn't even sold anything.

20:02.380 --> 20:03.740
I'd been trying for several years and hadn't.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.900
I've heard about writers such as John D. McDonald,

20:08.460 --> 20:09.340
a mystery writer,

20:10.400 --> 20:12.140
and he had to move several times

20:12.140 --> 20:14.900
because people would come in and just drop in.

20:15.020 --> 20:17.380
They would assume that he had nothing better to do

20:17.380 --> 20:19.920
than to talk with every fan that dropped in on his address.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.960
And so he would have to move so his address would be lost.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.560
It would take him two or three years to find him

20:24.560 --> 20:25.920
and then they'd take up his time again.

20:26.440 --> 20:30.100
Why have this happened to me if I ever get that well known?

20:30.900 --> 20:33.100
The answer was to use the pen name.

20:34.140 --> 20:37.120
So I set up with a pen name from the outset

20:37.120 --> 20:39.520
and it has protected me.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.620
I get a lot of fan mail.

20:40.860 --> 20:41.780
It goes through the publisher.

20:42.260 --> 20:44.260
I don't get many people dropping in on me

20:44.260 --> 20:45.340
because they can't find me.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.700
They can look up in the phone book.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.920
I don't know, maybe there's somebody locally called Anthony

20:49.920 --> 20:51.900
that keeps getting people dropping in on him.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.460
It's not me, you see.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.120
So I have protected myself.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.580
If I want someone to know who I am, I can tell them.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.260
But the stranger that just says,

21:01.340 --> 21:03.500
hey, gee, there's this writer, I think I'll drop in on him,

21:03.720 --> 21:05.160
he is unable to find me.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.680
And so now I'm beginning to approach the sort of success

21:10.600 --> 21:13.280
that the pseudonym was prepared for.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.180
I really never thought I would get there.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.660
It was just saying, suppose,

21:17.800 --> 21:19.840
and I planned well, I'm having more success

21:19.840 --> 21:21.580
than I really believed I would have.

21:21.980 --> 21:25.120
And now my pen name is serving to protect me,

21:25.720 --> 21:27.120
to protect my time, really.

21:27.660 --> 21:29.120
Not that I'm talking with people,

21:29.800 --> 21:31.820
but you know, there would be a lot of people

21:31.820 --> 21:32.900
that would just like to come.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.360
If there's a writer there, they won't even have read

21:35.360 --> 21:36.340
anything by that author.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.160
They say, gee, that's a writer, I'll go talk to him.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.260
But I don't need that sort of thing.

21:40.260 --> 21:43.080
I'm willing to talk to people that have read my works,

21:43.340 --> 21:45.800
that want to talk to me, ask me intelligent questions,

21:46.500 --> 21:47.940
that people more like you.

21:48.060 --> 21:51.040
You see, I'm not willing to talk to the man off the street.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.040
He just has heard that I'm a writer.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.920
He doesn't even know what I'm writing about.

21:57.560 --> 21:58.840
But just, if there's a writer,

21:59.020 --> 22:01.840
he just wants to go and talk to him and take up his time.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.940
So that's the reason.

22:05.060 --> 22:07.240
Again, a rather commercial reason, if you will.

22:09.580 --> 22:11.400
But I think it's factored.

22:12.420 --> 22:14.540
We'll have more about Piers Anthony on our next show.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:24.760 --> 22:27.340
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:27.340 --> 22:30.540
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:15.200 --> 23:19.160
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:37.900 --> 23:40.280
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.600
And here are your hosts.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.740
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

23:51.020 --> 23:53.680
The prolific science fiction and fantasy author Piers Anthony

23:53.680 --> 23:56.640
is often outspoken, and once he was even blacklisted

23:56.640 --> 23:57.880
by the publishing community.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.900
Anthony is a man with strong principles.

24:00.220 --> 24:02.400
One of his principles is that he responds to fan mail.

24:03.420 --> 24:06.060
It's a funny thing, I've never gone to a convention.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.720
I've never met people personally that way,

24:09.080 --> 24:11.660
mainly because I don't like to travel and I do like to write.

24:11.660 --> 24:14.020
But I do answer my mail.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.820
Yesterday, for last month, I simply went back

24:18.820 --> 24:20.340
and counted up the letters I had written.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.880
It was 64 letters.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.720
I had to take off whole weekend just to answer my fan mail.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.280
This is a problem, but if it gets much worse,

24:29.380 --> 24:31.640
I'm going to have to start smacking off on that

24:31.640 --> 24:35.040
because it takes me too long to finish a novel

24:35.040 --> 24:39.900
if I have to keep taking time off to answer the letters.

24:40.940 --> 24:43.160
But I am responsive. I do read them.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.660
I think about them each as an individual letter

24:46.360 --> 24:48.860
relating to what the fan has told me, what his needs are.

24:49.440 --> 24:52.440
One reason Anthony feels so strongly about responding to fan mail

24:52.440 --> 24:54.420
is that many of those who write them are children.

24:55.180 --> 24:56.860
You see, many of my letters are from children,

24:57.160 --> 24:58.900
9, 10, 11, 12 years old.

24:59.460 --> 25:03.860
And I think it's very important to them that I do answer them.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.420
When I was that age, I didn't like to be ignored

25:07.420 --> 25:09.820
when something was important to me.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.580
So I try to... It's a golden rule.

25:11.700 --> 25:14.540
I try to treat them as I wish I had been treated.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.800
And I don't...

25:19.800 --> 25:22.520
You might say, well, what does a guy ten years old have to tell me?

25:23.160 --> 25:25.740
Well, actually, he can tell me how he feels, how he reacts,

25:25.880 --> 25:29.180
how important it is, and what influence my novel has had on him.

25:29.540 --> 25:32.680
He will do so with a lot more tender than an adult will

25:32.680 --> 25:35.240
because he's not trying to impress me.

25:35.240 --> 25:36.740
He's just telling me what he likes.

25:36.820 --> 25:41.340
He doesn't have the art to be, you know, for duplicity.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.180
So that it's a little like animal psychology.

25:44.480 --> 25:46.940
You can see that human motives in animals

25:46.940 --> 25:49.140
because the animals don't know enough to conceal them.

25:49.820 --> 25:51.580
So I value these letters.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.880
I sometimes wish I just had more time.

25:54.260 --> 25:55.780
If I could have full time for writing

25:55.780 --> 25:58.460
and also full time for answering letters.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.820
So there is... It's been mostly this year,

26:03.000 --> 26:04.440
considerable correspondence developing.

26:05.160 --> 26:10.880
And I would say 50 or 60% of it is by people under the age of, say, 18.

26:11.260 --> 26:14.240
There's mostly young readers that I get.

26:21.460 --> 26:24.220
Pierce Anthony has a strong philosophical motive for writing.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.060
Making a living is part of the motive,

26:26.140 --> 26:28.360
but it's not the whole thing or even the most important part.

26:29.280 --> 26:33.740
I'd just like to think that I'm on Earth for some purpose

26:33.740 --> 26:35.400
other than just to feed my face.

26:35.860 --> 26:39.840
I want to do something and try to leave the universe a better place

26:39.840 --> 26:41.900
than it was when I came into it.

26:42.220 --> 26:45.080
If there's anything in my power I can do to improve things,

26:45.360 --> 26:46.580
then I want to do it.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.380
And I try to do this through the ability that I have,

26:49.500 --> 26:50.680
that as a writer.

26:51.600 --> 26:55.380
And so I want to write, in the guise of fiction,

26:55.380 --> 27:01.000
to write material that people will read and become better persons

27:01.000 --> 27:02.820
or get ideas that they wouldn't have.

27:03.080 --> 27:06.920
I've had some comments from fans saying that after reading some of my novels,

27:07.460 --> 27:09.500
they're thinking of the Splitting Finity series,

27:10.200 --> 27:12.520
they decided that honesty is the best policy.

27:12.580 --> 27:13.660
Now they admire honesty.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.560
Well, that pleases me.

27:15.660 --> 27:17.120
That's the kind of thing I want to do.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.480
The person was planning to be dishonest and he reads one of my novels

27:20.480 --> 27:24.640
and then he decides that he really would rather be honest.

27:24.640 --> 27:25.980
I believe in honesty.

27:26.140 --> 27:27.180
I want to encourage it.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.900
I think there should be more of it in the world.

27:29.580 --> 27:33.360
So I am trying to have a beneficial effect.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.020
You might say to justify my own existence.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.180
I'm making money out of it, yes.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.620
But while I'm making the money, I also want to do something that,

27:41.940 --> 27:45.900
well, when I die, I can look back and say I have done something useful in the world.

27:46.720 --> 27:50.800
So this is why I'm not satisfied just to write and get paid for it

27:50.800 --> 27:54.420
and not to worry about the theme or the content.

27:54.940 --> 27:57.600
I want to do something that I can be satisfied with,

27:57.760 --> 28:00.120
that I can be proud of, that will help people.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:10.380 --> 28:12.960
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:12.960 --> 28:16.160
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
