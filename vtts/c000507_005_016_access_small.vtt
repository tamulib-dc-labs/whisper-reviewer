00:01.980 --> 00:03.120
You might be in France already.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.720
No, I'm going to France on Monday.

00:05.360 --> 00:05.760
Oh, next week?

00:06.060 --> 00:06.260
Yeah.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.020
Okay, listen, I didn't hear what you told David.

00:08.180 --> 00:09.440
Did you have a few minutes now or should we?

00:09.440 --> 00:10.840
Yeah, I guess you might as well do it now.

00:10.980 --> 00:12.740
I mean, I might have a million things to do anyway.

00:13.040 --> 00:13.880
God knows when you get me.

00:14.060 --> 00:15.880
It's just going to be about ten minutes is all we need.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.040
Okay, is the tape running, David?

00:19.340 --> 00:19.900
Yeah, we're okay.

00:20.540 --> 00:21.620
Okay, we got the tape rolling.

00:22.660 --> 00:26.020
This is just ready to add to what we found out from you before about the book, You Know

00:26.020 --> 00:26.540
the Iron Dream.

00:26.980 --> 00:27.220
Right.

00:27.220 --> 00:30.600
I have a release here from Timescape, which is what I'm going on.

00:31.760 --> 00:38.040
Okay, from what I understand, the band in Germany came in late 1981, or 1981, rather.

00:38.620 --> 00:39.300
What does that...

00:39.300 --> 00:39.740
No, no.

00:42.940 --> 00:44.260
Well, I'm not...

00:44.260 --> 00:45.080
Is that what it says there?

00:45.160 --> 00:45.880
No, I'm not sure.

00:46.420 --> 00:49.300
The book was published in...

00:49.300 --> 00:50.160
Yeah, I guess it would be later.

00:50.340 --> 00:53.780
The book was published in Germany about February or so in 81.

00:53.780 --> 00:55.540
It was banned...

00:55.540 --> 00:56.980
And the partial...

00:56.980 --> 01:05.120
The initial case was instituted that summer, I believe, and then there were ministerial

01:05.120 --> 01:14.060
proceedings that went on until about February 82, at which point the book lost the second

01:14.680 --> 01:16.640
ministerial proceedings and was totally banned.

01:17.260 --> 01:18.180
So that's the time frame.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.280
Okay, could you explain to us briefly what the term ban means?

01:22.920 --> 01:26.320
Well, the term ban means you can't buy it, then you can't sell it.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.060
Simply.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.780
There are two kinds of bans.

01:30.940 --> 01:36.620
First of all, I believe it's in there, but basically the law states that anyone can complain

01:36.620 --> 01:43.540
to anyone, can complain to a police station, that a book or another work of art, for that

01:43.540 --> 01:45.360
matter, is unfit to the eyes of children.

01:45.360 --> 01:52.240
At which point a ministerial executive proceedings has started.

01:53.220 --> 01:57.340
During that proceedings, before anything is even decided, the book can still be sold,

01:57.860 --> 01:59.780
but it can't be displayed or advertised.

02:00.300 --> 02:04.480
In other words, you can buy it under the counters if it were condoms in the 1950s or something.

02:06.060 --> 02:12.100
Then a panel is selected of notable citizens or whatever, church leaders, youth group leaders,

02:12.700 --> 02:13.760
things like that.

02:13.760 --> 02:18.200
They form a kind of executive jury to rule on this.

02:18.880 --> 02:23.540
What happened with the iron dream is that the first time they did this, it was a tie

02:23.540 --> 02:24.820
and they couldn't come to a decision.

02:25.540 --> 02:31.160
They went back and did this procedure again and that commission banned the book, which

02:31.160 --> 02:32.680
means it's banned.

02:32.940 --> 02:33.900
You can't buy it.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.820
It is now being appealed to the courts.

02:38.860 --> 02:42.340
As far as you know, it's impossible to get a copy of it in Germany.

02:42.340 --> 02:47.500
Well, it's not quite impossible to get a copy of it because it was sold several months

02:47.500 --> 02:48.400
before this happened.

02:49.060 --> 02:54.280
There are a few copies, I don't know how many, probably several tens of thousands of copies

02:54.280 --> 02:57.860
drifting around that people have already bought, but you cannot buy it in Germany at

02:57.860 --> 03:01.660
this point in a bookstore or any place like that.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.980
Okay, I'm pretty sure I know your answer to this, but I'd like you to state it anyhow.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.900
What's your reaction to it, the ban?

03:10.400 --> 03:11.820
What's my reaction to the ban?

03:12.420 --> 03:14.260
My reaction to the ban is very complicated.

03:14.540 --> 03:18.860
First of all, it took ten years to get this book published in Germany.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.500
All my French friends said it would never be published in Germany.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.920
So when a Heineberg, you know, summoned up the courage to publish it, I was very pleased

03:27.920 --> 03:32.400
and I thought that this was going to, you know, that this represented the kind of maturity

03:32.400 --> 03:36.360
on the part of Germany that they're willing to look at this stuff and I felt very good

03:36.360 --> 03:38.480
about it being published there and I was a bit surprised.

03:39.260 --> 03:45.020
Now that it's banned, obviously I feel that, well, the book says it all.

03:45.180 --> 03:50.900
The book itself, in a way, is about why it was banned because it's the same sort of mentality

03:50.900 --> 03:58.460
that goes around banning books that resulted in a different kind of way in the Third Reich.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.680
It's not to say that all Germans are like this because the publisher has fought this

04:03.680 --> 04:05.340
all the way and is continuing to fight it.

04:05.340 --> 04:08.900
Most of the German newspapers, there's been a lot of coverage,

04:09.080 --> 04:10.920
supported the book against the ban.

04:12.660 --> 04:19.480
The German chapter of World SF had a vote and issued a public statement against the ban

04:19.480 --> 04:20.440
in supporting the book.

04:23.180 --> 04:28.280
So, you know, I think it's a very retrogressive thing and it says something about, I suppose,

04:28.460 --> 04:33.100
the German political and social system is that they do not understand the concept that is embodied

04:33.100 --> 04:35.620
in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

04:36.820 --> 04:41.840
And it's a particularly pernicious law because anything can be banned under this law

04:42.420 --> 04:46.820
or under the ground that it's not fit for children, even if it's not intended for children,

04:47.200 --> 04:50.460
which is exactly the kind of thing that the moral majority is trying to do here,

04:52.200 --> 04:54.380
which tells you what kind of people they are, too.

04:56.260 --> 05:02.200
OK, I don't see how it's possible to misunderstand your intention in the book and for anybody

05:02.200 --> 05:04.280
who could possibly admire Farrick Jagger.

05:04.720 --> 05:08.000
Do you think that any readers in Germany, young readers, would be in danger from reading it?

05:08.980 --> 05:15.820
Well, any. I mean, you know, you know, Hinkley certainly misunderstood St.

05:16.020 --> 05:20.480
Taxi driver, so there's always schizophrenics and maniacs around who can misunderstand anything.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.800
I mean, David Harwood's heard demons in his head.

05:23.980 --> 05:27.020
I mean, there are always completely crazy people who can read things out of something

05:27.500 --> 05:28.800
that were never in there.

05:28.800 --> 05:35.100
So, like, you want two people around, you know, psychotics who could get anything out of any book.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.080
But I don't see the book is written on two levels.

05:38.320 --> 05:43.040
The sophisticated readers, they understand what it is to begin with.

05:43.780 --> 05:50.600
The other level is that the kind of people who are into things like Terry Rodin and that kind of proto-fascist

05:51.120 --> 05:56.340
science fantasy, would start off reading the book, maybe identifying with Farrick Jagger,

05:56.340 --> 06:00.480
you know, a third of the way into it, and then suddenly realizing what it is they're identifying

06:00.480 --> 06:04.700
with. And so it becomes a kind of deprogramming experience for the kind of people that they

06:04.700 --> 06:12.020
claim would be harmed. I think it would be a very strongly anti-Nazi book, precisely for those

06:12.020 --> 06:15.840
kinds of young people who might have leanings in that direction, because they would then be confronted

06:15.840 --> 06:20.780
with what it is that they're really identifying with. So, no, I don't, you know, I think it is,

06:20.780 --> 06:28.100
I think it would be a more positive anti-Nazi deprogramming experience for the sort of naive

06:28.100 --> 06:37.140
reader who, you know, grew up on Terry Rodin and that kind of crap, rather than, you know,

06:37.280 --> 06:41.620
tend to make them identify. I don't think anybody can read the whole book and get through it and

06:41.620 --> 06:49.560
still identify with Farrick Jagger. Okay, just one more. I guess it's, yeah, the reaction to the

06:49.560 --> 06:53.020
Iron Dream and other European countries. I think, for instance, in France, you won the

06:53.020 --> 06:56.580
pre-apollo for it. It must have done over pretty well in rest of Europe, right?

06:56.880 --> 07:05.860
This book has been published now in the United States, Britain, France, Japan, Spain, Portugal,

07:06.380 --> 07:16.060
Argentina, Italy, forget where else, about eight different countries. It's been published in the

07:16.060 --> 07:25.340
Axis Powers, published in Argentina, and it's been extensively reviewed in about eight different

07:25.340 --> 07:33.240
countries. There's no, I have no instance where the book was misunderstood and was taken as anything,

07:33.440 --> 07:42.320
but an anti-Nazi and anti-fascist novel throughout the world. It's the only instance of it. In fact,

07:42.320 --> 07:48.760
in Germany itself, Stern Magazine, which is hardly a liberal publication over there,

07:49.080 --> 07:53.300
to like the Time Magazine of Germany or something like that, and I believe it's owned by

07:53.300 --> 07:58.400
Actual Springer for that matter, when they reviewed the book, they gave it a very favorable review

07:58.400 --> 08:03.640
in Germany. And what they said, among other things in their review, that it was something of a

08:03.640 --> 08:08.300
disgrace, that it took ten years for a book like this to be published in Germany, where it would be

08:08.300 --> 08:12.400
most useful to have it published. They sort of tried it in Germany itself, but they took ten

08:12.400 --> 08:18.280
years to publish a book. So even in Germany, the press did not take it in the wrong one.

08:20.440 --> 08:25.660
Okay, before I let you go, I just, I'd like to, I was curious, the movie, the movie rights to

08:25.660 --> 08:30.760
Bugjack Baron that you've sold, I read the piece in Starlog about it. How's that going? Is that

08:30.760 --> 08:35.340
look like it's going to go through? Yeah, that looks like a very strong project. The movie rights

08:35.340 --> 08:40.960
have, the book has been bought out. Harlem has had a third of the way through the script.

08:42.100 --> 08:47.580
Costa Garvers, as I understand it, is moving to California to start pre-production, because the

08:47.580 --> 08:53.960
book is going to be made in America, not in France. And I would expect that it would, that it will be

08:53.960 --> 09:02.620
made, talking about the start, starting shooting early next year, possibly this far. But of course,

09:02.620 --> 09:06.500
you never know what the shooting schedule is going to be until I finalize the script. But the thing

09:06.500 --> 09:12.400
is progressing, and I would expect it will be made. That's great. I was pleased to read that.

09:13.060 --> 09:19.680
And also, one more thing, the, this Timescape release on the Iron Dream said that your next

09:19.680 --> 09:24.100
book was The Void Captain's Tale. It's coming out in January. I'd assume then, since they're putting

09:24.100 --> 09:28.080
it out, that is a science fiction book. Yes, it's a science fiction book. It's a hard cover.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.520
Okay, maybe just one or two sentences on what it concerns?

09:32.820 --> 09:37.480
Oh my God, well, it's a very difficult book to describe in one or two sentences. It takes place

09:37.480 --> 09:48.540
entirely on, it's one week on a spaceship. It's about, it's about metaphysics, sex, and, and, and,

09:49.160 --> 09:55.360
and space travel. It's, it's predicated upon a faster than a light drive that is built around

09:56.140 --> 10:02.980
orgasm. And it's about a relationship between the captain of the ship and the pilot who is a kind

10:02.980 --> 10:13.040
of organic module in the star drive, who's, who is kind of electronically pushed to orgasm, which

10:13.580 --> 10:17.160
has to do with the mechanics of the star drive itself and the cycle, and it's a psychological

10:17.160 --> 10:23.340
story, but it's a sort of a love story between these two people. It is also written in a, it takes

10:23.340 --> 10:30.800
place about 3000, 4000 years in the future, and it is told by the captain of the spaceship

10:31.480 --> 10:36.280
in a sort of complicated diary, not in a diary format, but it's told by, by the character of the

10:36.280 --> 10:43.580
spaceship in his own language, which is a, an extrapolation of the situation in which

10:44.480 --> 10:48.800
human languages have sort of co-arrest into one language, except be everybody speaks a different

10:48.800 --> 10:55.260
dialect of this, of, of the same human lingo. And so it is a, it's written in a very experimental

10:55.260 --> 11:00.840
kind of prose. It's, it's, it's full of our foreign words and foreign expressions. And I think it,

11:00.860 --> 11:06.540
it represents something I haven't done since bug jack baron and something that nobody's really done

11:06.540 --> 11:12.620
since, since the sixties. It's written in a very, it's, it, the prose itself is, is future oriented

11:12.620 --> 11:16.640
and, and made up and is an integral part of the book.

11:18.460 --> 11:23.460
Okay, good. We'll look forward to that. Okay, listen, we'll, we'll send you these tapes on. I think

11:23.460 --> 11:26.980
probably we'll get two shows out of this one on what you'd given us earlier on the book, and then

11:26.980 --> 11:31.480
you're, you're, you know, your reactions to that band. By the way, the same issue of starlog that

11:31.480 --> 11:35.420
had that little piece in bug jack baron had a little article about us, if you're interested, it was

11:35.420 --> 11:41.380
a page afterwards. Okay, and I think there are two stations in New York now that carry us, one in

11:41.380 --> 11:47.640
Fredonia, one in green veil or green something. Yeah, so I don't think there's any of the

11:47.640 --> 11:51.740
metropolitan area that you could pick up, but when, when, if there ever are, we'll go ahead and send

11:51.740 --> 11:57.160
you the names of the stations. Do you have any idea when this is going to run? Let's see, okay,

11:57.240 --> 12:02.860
we're early June, probably July, mid-July, maybe the end of July. It'll be, I think your book comes

12:02.860 --> 12:07.580
out this month, uh, timescape, the paperback edition. So it might give a little boost to that

12:07.580 --> 12:12.220
if enough people listen to it. Listen, we appreciate your time again and hope you have a

12:12.220 --> 12:16.420
productive trip to France. Okay. And thank you very much again, Mr. Spindrap. By the way,

12:16.540 --> 12:21.480
I have one more little item which would be just relevance to you. Good. Is that my book, The

12:21.480 --> 12:27.240
Mind Game, is being done as a full 90-minute radio play in France this summer.

12:29.560 --> 12:34.940
A radio play? A radio drama, a radio play, yes. Our French national radio.

12:36.280 --> 12:40.320
Apparently they do stuff like that over there, which is kind of interesting. It's a good format for

12:41.040 --> 12:44.120
for many things. They're doing a 90-minute radio play.

12:45.840 --> 12:50.300
In France. That will be in France, right? It will be in France. Yeah, okay, there'd be no use for,

12:50.660 --> 12:54.660
I guess it won't be a script or anything available in English. Well, I guess it might be a script

12:54.660 --> 13:00.220
if somebody could, that could be translated, but the script will be in France. Okay, is there

13:00.220 --> 13:03.340
anything else? I mean, you might think of adding that we could, you know, little items that we

13:03.340 --> 13:10.200
stick to, you know, show? I do have a book on writing coming out in a form called Staying Alive,

13:10.360 --> 13:15.840
which is a collection of my Locust columns with a lot of additional material published by by Donning.

13:16.320 --> 13:24.080
And that'll be out around September, October. And also in the four will be The Children of

13:24.080 --> 13:28.120
Hamelin will be done by a small press outfit called Pequod Press. This is the thing that was

13:29.000 --> 13:33.240
a novel that was never been before before being published in book form. It was serialized in

13:33.240 --> 13:42.400
Los Angeles Free Press in about 1972 or so and was never published in book form anywhere. This will

13:42.400 --> 13:47.020
be its first book publication. That'll also be in a form. Yeah, I think we got some information

13:47.020 --> 13:52.080
from you on that one the last time we spoke with you. That's right. Yeah. Okay, listen, we've taken

13:52.080 --> 13:56.200
enough of your time, I guess. We better let you go. And again, we appreciate very much your time

13:56.200 --> 13:59.400
and we'll be sending the tapes on to you when the show is air. Okay, you're very welcome. Thank you.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.500
Have a good trip. Bye bye.
