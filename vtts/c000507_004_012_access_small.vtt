00:11.100 --> 00:18.200
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today, presented by the

00:18.200 --> 00:20.440
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.980
This is David Cruz and David Carson.

00:31.500 --> 00:37.460
On this program we will be talking with author Larry Niven. Niven first appeared in print in 1964,

00:37.980 --> 00:44.360
and by 1976 he had won the Hugo Award five times. He has written a set of stories set in what he calls

00:44.360 --> 00:52.040
which are a series of stories with a common background. He has also written several novels and stories

00:52.040 --> 00:57.360
not related to the known space series. Aside from science fiction, Niven has written a fantasy

00:57.360 --> 01:03.200
called The Magic Goes Away and co-authored with Jerry Pranell, a science fiction rendering of Dante's Inferno,

01:03.600 --> 01:08.700
entitled appropriately enough, Inferno. Other collaborations with Jerry Pranell include

01:08.700 --> 01:12.260
A Moat in God's Eye and the bestseller Lucifer's Hammer.

01:12.560 --> 01:17.800
Here's my first question to you Mr. Niven. I'd like to ask if you classify yourself as a hard science fiction writer

01:17.800 --> 01:19.240
in the tradition of Hal Clement?

01:19.980 --> 01:29.580
If you've got the class of Jaime, that's where I sit, yes. I would, I suppose all writers resist classification as best they can.

01:30.620 --> 01:39.600
I do other things too. Fantasy. Considerable fantasy, a great deal more hard science fiction,

01:40.300 --> 01:51.420
not much in the way of soft science fiction. Articles, speeches, I'm the guy who did a study of the medical problems

01:51.420 --> 01:58.920
of breeding Kryptonians called Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex, and I just published the only venture

01:58.920 --> 02:05.360
I've ever made into economics, a method which would also solve the problem of nuclear waste disposal.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.980
The idea is to turn the nuclear waste into coins. A healthy economy is one in which the money circulates fast.

02:15.160 --> 02:20.920
You mentioned that you had not written much in the area of soft science fiction. Do you think the new wave is past

02:20.920 --> 02:25.180
that fans and writers are turning back to strongly science-oriented stories?

02:25.180 --> 02:34.860
Yes, I do. However, the new wave was very good to me. When I was first getting started, I was the only new hard science fiction writer.

02:35.400 --> 02:45.600
The new wave is a very persuasive thing and very easy to use to justify bad stories. I think that's what killed it.

02:45.600 --> 02:57.980
Not that increased characterization and experiments with typography and story format are a bad thing in themselves,

02:57.980 --> 03:04.300
but it's so easy to use new wave to justify a bad story. It was bound to go out.

03:04.640 --> 03:09.220
How did you begin writing science fiction? Were you always a science fiction reader, a fan?

03:09.220 --> 03:17.300
Yes, and presently I found I was making up daydreaming stories that seemed worth writing.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.600
Did you tell the stories to others before you gained enough confidence to write them down?

03:22.020 --> 03:24.300
Yes, I've been a storyteller all my life.

03:25.180 --> 03:31.560
Do you have a large and involved fan following? Do you ever write specifically for them or do you write only what you want to?

03:31.560 --> 03:41.980
I mostly write for myself, for an imaginary reader who resembles me a great deal. Only he needs things explained to him.

03:43.580 --> 03:48.520
Beyond that, I sell it where I can and pick up readers where I can.

03:49.120 --> 03:54.080
Let's turn to your known space series for a moment. How did you get started writing a future history?

03:54.080 --> 04:02.060
Well, there had been future histories around. Poole Anderson and Robert Heinlein.

04:03.880 --> 04:10.200
I tell you, I guess we each evolved the idea somewhat independently.

04:10.640 --> 04:19.160
The idea is that if you carved out a consistent, workable future, it seems a shame to waste it on one story.

04:20.360 --> 04:28.780
You put in the background because you want the background of a story to seem bigger than it is.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.200
So there are things that are simply unexplained.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.940
And if you think of more to say on a given subject, why you go with it?

04:40.120 --> 04:46.540
And if you think of a story that fits into the background of a previous story and allows you to elaborate on that background,

04:46.540 --> 04:51.740
sometimes you fall in love with the background and presently you've got a bunch of stories that link.

04:52.740 --> 04:57.780
In the afterward of Ringworld Engineers, you said that your known space series was completed.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.460
Is that still true and if so, why?

05:01.000 --> 05:08.480
I've given up saying that the known space series is dating. There's just no point in it.

05:08.560 --> 05:13.020
I've written five books worth of known space stories since I said that.

05:14.200 --> 05:20.400
And besides that, I have no doubt that I'll come up with stories said in the Gildly Arms Times.

05:20.740 --> 05:29.180
I like writing science fiction detective stories. It's just hard work. I do not have a detective story in my head.

05:29.640 --> 05:35.180
It'll have to work. But that's the beginning of known space and I'll continue to work with it where it looks like fun.

05:35.860 --> 05:41.640
You have, as you mentioned, written science fiction detective stories and you've experimented with humor in science fiction.

05:41.640 --> 05:47.060
Is there any subject area that you think can't be handled well in the science fiction genre?

05:47.700 --> 05:57.560
No, I can't think of any. I guess I go along with the idea that there are these interlocked circles to represent various areas of fiction.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.620
They all swim in the sea of fantasy.

06:00.320 --> 06:05.820
Science fiction probably includes the entire portion of fantasy that is possible.

06:07.560 --> 06:12.100
And mainstream would be somewhere in there and nurse novels would be somewhere in that.

06:12.320 --> 06:22.500
There would be no subject you could treat in English that couldn't be treated in a science fiction format except fantasy and that would be treated in a fantasy format.

06:23.200 --> 06:28.780
Probably your best known work in the known space series is Ringworld. Can you tell us how that concept came about?

06:29.780 --> 06:41.360
Oh, I ran across the concept Dyson Sphere. Dyson the mathematician came up with the concept Dyson Shell and he was misunderstood to some extent.

06:41.800 --> 06:45.820
So presently I ran across an article about Dyson Sphere.

06:45.820 --> 06:58.800
I picture that as a golf ball 93 million miles in radius with a sun at the center and gravity generators all around the outside so you would live on the inside,

06:59.040 --> 07:03.760
tariff on it with oceans and soil and air.

07:05.280 --> 07:11.640
I ran across that and I didn't like it. I thought it could be improved and I wound up with the Ringworld.

07:12.720 --> 07:20.320
Freeman Dyson in commenting on your adaptation of his idea said that a great number of small Ringworlds would be better than the large one that you had.

07:20.320 --> 07:27.740
Believe I gave an acceptable answer to that in the Ringworld engineers, but in general he'd be right.

07:28.820 --> 07:38.000
It's just that the Ringworld engineers in particular are people who like dependable weapons of huge size.

07:38.940 --> 07:44.740
Many of your fans pointed out a number of mistakes and made many elaborations on the concept of the Ringworld.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.980
Can you tell us what some of them were and how they were corrected or worked into the sequel?

07:49.620 --> 07:56.080
For instance, I suspected the Ringworld was unstable and I suspected you'd need attitude jets.

07:56.840 --> 08:03.900
I was sure that the Ringworld was spinning fast enough to permit Bazar-Ramjet to be used as attitude jets,

08:04.020 --> 08:07.460
which means you don't have a fuel problem at all. You're burning the solar wind.

08:09.500 --> 08:17.940
But rapidly some MIT people demonstrated that the Ringworld was unstable and they were chanting it in the hall at the next Worldcon.

08:17.940 --> 08:21.180
The Ringworld is unstable. The Ringworld is unstable.

08:23.660 --> 08:31.280
It still took about seven years for anyone to figure out the exact numbers for the instability and they are horrifying.

08:31.600 --> 08:38.960
A major solar flare would have the Ringworld grinding against its sun in five years.

08:41.840 --> 08:46.920
Well, I worked in the plot. That was one elaboration or error.

08:48.760 --> 08:56.260
Another just can't be correct. It seems that there's too much twilight with the shadow squares set up the way I have them set up.

08:56.480 --> 09:04.300
You get too much of neither day nor night but twilight half the sun showing, part of the sun showing.

09:05.200 --> 09:12.740
The shadow squares ought to be set up with about five big shadow squares moving in a retrograde world.

09:14.760 --> 09:20.300
That way you get day and night setting much faster when it sets.

09:22.440 --> 09:27.120
Terminator line moves like a bat out of hell. It's still a little fuzzy, but it doesn't matter.

09:28.440 --> 09:39.720
Third point, somebody pointed out that the tensile strength necessary to hold the Ringworld together is on the order of the tensile strength of an atomic nucleus.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.760
It's a super strong force.

09:43.380 --> 09:51.340
Okay, I can live with that. I can postulate that. I knew scrypte would have to be stronger than any normal material already.

09:53.260 --> 09:59.820
Fourth point, some high school class in Florida got to work on the Ringworld.

10:00.560 --> 10:08.340
And their conclusion was that the Ringworld's worst problem is that all the top soil would wind up in the oceans in about 3,000 years.

10:08.840 --> 10:13.560
There are no earthquakes on the Ringworld. No mountain building forces.

10:16.040 --> 10:28.620
Okay, that's a tough one. I set up a spill pipe system that runs the sea bottom mark from the sea bottoms under the Ringworld and up over the edge of the Ringwall.

10:30.340 --> 10:39.980
That even allows you some mines, accumulation of useful metals.

10:41.320 --> 10:58.280
What else? Checking in my head, I find Frank Gisperic's suggestion that a machine building culture on the Ringworld which reached our level wouldn't have any petroleum products to use.

10:58.280 --> 11:02.480
They would wind up using alcohol, where we use gasoline.

11:03.640 --> 11:19.340
And fine, I can live with that. As a matter of fact, the sludge from making alcohol for automobiles, the sludge can be used to make plastics, maybe plastic like substances, maybe.

11:20.940 --> 11:27.920
The chemicals are just as elaborate as the residues from petroleum. What else?

11:29.080 --> 11:37.500
Still checking in my head, I pick up on other things I can't use such as Dan Alderson's solar system, which involves four Ringworlds.

11:38.200 --> 11:45.620
He's got three Ringworlds about the size of mine rotating orthogonally on frictionless bearings.

11:46.940 --> 11:53.540
And the fourth Ringworld is about the size of the orbit of Jupiter and inhabited by mesplanites.

11:54.040 --> 11:58.020
Mesplanites derived from a novel by Hal Klement, Mission of Gravity.

11:59.000 --> 12:10.240
And mesplanites require cold temperatures about those of the orbit of Jupiter as opposed to Jupiter, which has an internal source.

12:10.240 --> 12:19.500
Cold temperatures and heavy gravity. So his fourth Ringworld is the size of the orbit of Jupiter and spinning like a bat out of hell.

12:20.080 --> 12:28.040
I had it figured out that if they spun that Ringworld any faster, it would get nearer the speed of light and contract.

12:29.060 --> 12:35.920
Dan says I've misunderstood relativity, it would not contract. Okay, I still haven't figured out why not.

12:35.920 --> 12:43.840
Well, you obviously enjoy playing the game as how clinic calls it between your own scientific knowledge and that of your readers and peers.

12:44.340 --> 12:52.920
Absolutely. I incorporated everything that sounded good that I could use in elaborating the design of the Ringworld.

12:53.360 --> 12:58.320
What do you think about the current ideas for space habitats that are proposed by Gerardo Neal and others?

12:58.320 --> 13:09.320
I think they are grandiose and I certainly wouldn't stop him. But the space program seems to have fallen flat on its face at this point.

13:10.160 --> 13:18.400
We will have trouble reaching the moon again. Getting back to the moon is as big a problem as we can face.

13:20.100 --> 13:24.560
I resent having to say that, but I believe it's true.

13:26.080 --> 13:31.120
Let's turn for a moment to another of your novels, one written with Jerry Brunel, The Mode in God's Eye.

13:31.900 --> 13:36.680
How do you go about constructing an alien like the Moedys? Were you influenced by anyone in that area?

13:37.120 --> 13:50.360
The Moedys were, no, not in that case. In that case, I had the idea that I was following a progression with a protozoan with an amoeba.

13:50.360 --> 14:03.340
You get radial symmetry inside and out. Move up a goodly distance and you find starfishes with radial symmetry on the outside and bilateral symmetry on the inside.

14:03.580 --> 14:08.540
Move up a little further and you find flat worms and worms of all stance.

14:09.420 --> 14:24.040
At the level of bilateral symmetry inside and out, go as far as a human and you find bilateral symmetry on the outside and no symmetry, well, half symmetrical on the inside.

14:24.460 --> 14:31.420
The lungs look symmetrical, the kidneys look symmetrical, the intestines look like somebody dropped a plate of spaghetti.

14:31.420 --> 14:44.960
I tried to move on to the next step, bilaterally unsymmetrical on the outside and I got the original Moody, which was the engineer for me.

14:45.820 --> 14:54.400
But I always design aliens for themselves. I almost never design an alien to match a story.

14:54.400 --> 15:01.700
The story, some story will eventually include the alien. The alien stands for itself.

15:02.520 --> 15:11.620
I think that one of the outstanding aspects of the Moedys was their non-use of standardized machines. They would create whatever replacement parts that they needed on the spot.

15:12.420 --> 15:16.120
Do you recall what caused you to think along those lines for your alien society?

15:16.120 --> 15:26.040
I was just playing along. I was just playing with the ideas at that point and that one seemed like a fun one.

15:26.460 --> 15:39.400
It also seemed likely enough if you've got a critter with not much intelligence except in the direction of tool making and tool altering, then why not?

15:40.120 --> 15:50.620
The thing has to keep testing its ability or it will lose it. It might as well be designing something every time it needs a specific machine.

15:52.080 --> 16:01.740
The master can always stop it and have it reducing as if by assembly lines. If a master needs a lot of something fast.

16:02.880 --> 16:12.820
In Ringworld you developed something called the Tila Brown gene. Humans spread to be lucky. Was that just a story gimmick or were you extrapolating on the evolution of humanity?

16:15.820 --> 16:24.480
Partly that and partly you've got to remember the time I was writing. I was damn sick and tired of psychic powers showing up in stories.

16:25.400 --> 16:31.560
I did not believe in psychic powers at that time. I've been told they look pretty good now.

16:32.480 --> 16:45.960
But at the time I can see the Tila Brown gene as being the ultimate psychic power which you may interpret either as luck or as author control.

16:49.680 --> 17:00.120
In that sense it was something of a put on except that I can believe almost anything while I'm writing the story and I am able to extrapolate.

17:01.020 --> 17:14.080
So if Tila Brown is lucky certain things emerge and if she's just a statistical fool then something else emerges and that's that people will interpret anything that happens to her as luck.

17:14.820 --> 17:16.320
Defending their preconception.

17:17.860 --> 17:21.380
What do you consider to be your best work or your favorite work?

17:22.160 --> 17:32.880
No I couldn't tell you that. There is no way I can name a favorite work. My career is a progression for one thing.

17:33.460 --> 17:41.820
Take any novel or any important short story even out of that progression and it wanders away in a different direction.

17:43.260 --> 17:55.420
So I don't think I have a favorite story but I suppose I can name Inconton Moon which is virtually the only strictly love story I've ever done.

17:56.220 --> 18:00.660
And I suppose I could name Lucifer's Hammer which made me the most money.

18:02.900 --> 18:15.000
So a moat in God's eye may be that. I suppose I could name oh Man of Steel Woman of Kleenex which has gotten me the most laughs I suppose.

18:16.120 --> 18:20.440
Everybody seems to have read it and those who haven't have heard of out of the cocktail party.

18:23.780 --> 18:24.820
Or what?

18:26.840 --> 18:36.220
Jerry Purnell and I just recently wrote The Last Ten Minutes for a movie that had a good 90 minutes followed by a bad last 10 minutes.

18:37.160 --> 18:41.620
The last I've heard is they're not going to make the movie which is a dirty shame.

18:42.100 --> 18:46.260
That is they're not going to make the last 10 minutes hour away. They're going to fiddle with what they've got.

18:46.260 --> 18:49.480
And that's a really dirty shame. What they've got is garbage.

18:51.220 --> 19:00.680
I really hope they use that last 10 minutes and if they do I will get considerable enjoyment out of that and that will be my favorite you name it.

19:01.620 --> 19:07.740
You mentioned your collaboration with Jerry Purnell. Which do you prefer, writing alone or with another author?

19:07.740 --> 19:12.920
I prefer variety. I even prefer variety in my collaborators.

19:13.680 --> 19:18.720
I just finished a novel with a Stephen Barnes and we're starting another.

19:19.680 --> 19:24.920
A short one. And Jerry and I are starting another almost instantly.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.120
A novel about...

19:29.120 --> 19:37.640
Well we've designed an alien that could invade the Earth and also would want...

19:39.080 --> 19:46.180
It's tough to get an alien whom you could believe would want to invade the Earth from another star.

19:46.380 --> 19:49.900
Considering the distances involved and the energy involved.

19:49.900 --> 20:02.060
And the penalties for failure and the lack of the unlikelihood that it will do your home planet any good if you conquer something that is six light years away.

20:02.900 --> 20:07.700
Anyway we've designed one and we will be writing a novel about that.

20:08.880 --> 20:12.920
When writing in collaboration is it difficult to decide who writes what?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.960
Hard sometimes but it always resolves.

20:18.380 --> 20:25.200
The question is who is most qualified to write a given scene that we have both decided needs writing.

20:25.580 --> 20:28.540
Before we start we have the novel all laid out.

20:29.360 --> 20:34.680
We know what's going in virtually everywhere and if we don't it feels like we do.

20:35.520 --> 20:39.120
And if we find out we don't we elaborate as we get to that section.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.940
Okay the next question is who is qualified to write a given scene.

20:44.100 --> 20:48.300
Sometimes it's obvious. If we're dealing with a madman he's mine.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.100
If we're dealing with military operations it's Jerry.

20:52.720 --> 20:57.940
Aliens are generally mine. Politics is generally Jerry's.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.680
Knowledge of history generally Jerry's.

21:01.680 --> 21:09.360
And a real evil son of a bitch Jerry usually creates him and I usually run with him afterwards.

21:11.120 --> 21:17.860
Because Jerry has a lot of textbooks on psychology and PhD in psychology for that matter.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.900
Sorry doctorate in psychology.

21:22.140 --> 21:27.560
And when he's created a really evil son of a bitch he just hates him too much to work with him.

21:27.560 --> 21:33.400
I can usually do something. Horace Berry went that way and the rapist in Lucie's hammer.

21:34.940 --> 21:37.780
And a couple of the characters in Inferno.

21:38.340 --> 21:43.480
I understand that both you and Mr. Penel use computer word processors. How does that aid in your writing?

21:44.280 --> 21:51.820
It makes first draft a little faster but it makes corrections enormously faster.

21:52.620 --> 21:56.420
You get a more polished novel when I'm using word processors.

21:57.780 --> 22:00.920
It's polishing is just like sinking into the machine almost.

22:03.900 --> 22:10.120
The word processor seems like a magic typewriter. It does everything you would want a typewriter to do only it can.

22:10.520 --> 22:16.980
It can't erase full blocks of print at a time and then straighten up the page so it looks like you never made any corrections.

22:16.980 --> 22:25.000
But a word processor can do just that. And move blocks up and down the page. Up and down the manuscript.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.160
What do you think Mr. Nevin is the future of science fiction?

22:28.820 --> 22:32.800
Has fantasy begun taking over or is there a lot more hard science fiction to come?

22:33.500 --> 22:39.940
Hard to say. For one thing writers in general don't take orders where they're damn.

22:40.780 --> 22:46.160
The science fiction field is galloping off in all directions just as it always has.

22:47.020 --> 22:49.980
And the reader will make the final decision in most cases.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.920
What will be successful, it will depend on who buys what book.

22:57.020 --> 22:58.300
It's always been true.

22:59.500 --> 23:05.720
I understand that some of your works were involved several years ago with the animated Star Trek series. How did that come about?

23:05.720 --> 23:12.680
Oh it went like this. They were going to start a Star Trek cartoon.

23:14.380 --> 23:17.680
And the lady who was story editor got me involved.

23:19.580 --> 23:25.740
I tried to give them a story that involved a mini black hole and an outsider ship.

23:25.740 --> 23:35.460
I had the idea that Star Trek had been using many rubber suits for so long that they wouldn't realize how much more freedom they had with the animated version.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.660
That turns out not to be the case. They had some very good ideas.

23:41.780 --> 23:46.900
But that story turned out to be a little over the heads of their intended audience.

23:49.100 --> 23:58.140
So I want, it did incidentally wind up as the first version of the last part of a story called Order of the Soul.

23:59.920 --> 24:11.740
So I eventually wound up meeting Gene Roddenberry and he wound up suggesting why don't I take a story called Soft Weapon and turn it into a Star Trek version.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.560
And I did that and called it the Slaver Weapon.

24:18.760 --> 24:30.040
And fine, they eventually made a cartoon out of it. They also sold the right to turn that cartoon script into a story. They sold that to Ballantyne.

24:30.820 --> 24:40.540
I got mildly upset. The president of the Civil, who was Jerry Brunel at the time, got seriously upset and started making as many waves as he could.

24:41.280 --> 24:50.580
And what eventually happened was that they sent me a dollar for a check for two dollars and something, something, something, somewhere between two and three dollars.

24:52.380 --> 25:03.100
And Jerry, I don't know where the negotiations went, but Jerry wound up saying, OK, that defends the principle of the thing. We'll ask for more next time.

25:04.520 --> 25:19.000
And that's that for some years. By then I had written to Ballantyne and gotten a letter from Betty Ballantyne saying, hey, we won't ever use it. We promise, we see you're upset. We promise we won't ever do anything with this.

25:20.100 --> 25:28.900
A little later, the Ballantyne's got out of the Ballantyne Books business and into the business of printing illustrated stuff.

25:29.980 --> 25:43.040
And Judy Lindell Ray wound up in charge. And presently, presently I'm being offered two thousand bucks as advisors to Alan Dean Foster, who will turn my script into a novel.

25:45.360 --> 25:55.320
And I said, fine, what I really meant was acceptable. A few months later, I've got a letter from Judy Lind dropping the price to five hundred and I pulled my top.

25:55.720 --> 26:10.140
I said, A, I won't collaborate with you or Alan on anything of the kind. And B, you may not use anything from known space except what's in the script. And that is the way it happened.

26:10.680 --> 26:15.400
Are there any plans for Motion Picture or Television Adaptations of any of your works in the near future?

26:15.900 --> 26:30.460
Yes, there are. I just don't know how far they are going to go. But there is a group that owns an option on death by ecstasy and a guy who owns an option on the modian God's eye.

26:30.460 --> 26:49.000
And let's see, I've got a friend trying to get a public broadcasting system to make a TV version of Lucifer of In Constant Moon, which would be nice, all of which would be nice.

26:49.480 --> 26:53.280
Are there any contemporary writers that you particularly enjoy reading?

26:53.280 --> 27:08.820
Yes, I agree, many. Ursula Le Guin, John Varley, Poo Anderson, Jerry Pornell. How far do we go with this? I like the old ones and I like the new ones.

27:08.820 --> 27:27.680
I like about half of Harlan Ellison's stories, which is a better record than many writers have. I like a few of Bill Dick's stories. And I will probably buy the Last of the Dursire books by Gordie Dixon.

27:28.780 --> 27:48.340
In fact, it's Dan's certain I will read it. I'll buy it if it doesn't come free. I swamped in free books. I'm a Piers Anthony fan. I don't know how numerous we Piers Anthony fans are. I like the puzzles in his books.

27:48.340 --> 27:55.920
And his books are always jammed with puzzles and new ways of thinking and so forth.

27:56.420 --> 28:03.000
One last question. I don't suppose those Piers and puppeteers ever stuck you the formula for the general products whole, did they?

28:03.000 --> 28:19.780
No, I don't have the formula for the general products, though, but I have reason to suspect the pair of puppeteers on Earth. Look at the characteristics. Forget the shape. They must be masters of biology to hide that peculiar three-legged two-headed shape.

28:19.780 --> 28:36.300
But consider their characteristics. They are cowards. That is, they want everything utterly safe. No corners on anything. Everything is soft surfaces around the puppeteer world. They don't even keep their world near a sun.

28:36.960 --> 29:04.000
Regarding it as a runaway fusion reactor, which of course it is. So, desperate regard for safety, they plus an urge to meddle in the lifestyles of other species. Driving urge to meddle with practically no restraints attached. What does that remind you of? It seems nearly certain to me that Ralph Nader is a Piersan's puppet here.

29:15.900 --> 29:27.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, in conjunction with KOCV FM and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
