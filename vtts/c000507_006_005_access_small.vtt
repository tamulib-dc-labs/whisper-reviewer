Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.120 --> 00:33.420
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.720
And here are your hosts.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.680
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

00:44.140 --> 00:48.500
Michael Whalen. He has to be recognized as the hottest artist going in the science fiction and fantasy field.

00:48.800 --> 00:54.200
In the fall of 1983, he won the latest of several hugos, he's garnered his best artist doing science fiction and fantasy work.

00:54.740 --> 00:58.480
We spoke with Whalen recently and asked him when his interest in science fiction and fantasy art began.

00:59.160 --> 01:08.720
I think it developed when I was born. My father's always worked in the space industry, or in the missiles and space industry.

01:08.960 --> 01:16.080
So I had that input around me. He had always been reading science fiction since I was young.

01:16.200 --> 01:26.180
So I had the magazines around to look at and some of my earliest recollections are of looking at the covers of old amazing stories, magazines, or paperback books.

01:26.180 --> 01:37.740
In fact, some of them influenced me to a great deal. Before I could even read or write, I remember looking at some of those covers for hours and absorbing the visual feeling of the paintings.

01:38.660 --> 01:47.620
There were a few that were especially captivating for me. I remembered them to this day exactly what the paintings looked like.

01:47.620 --> 01:51.800
I could describe to you the compositions and some of the colors of the paintings.

01:52.900 --> 02:00.040
It's a funny thing at the last World Science Fiction Convention, I was walking down by one of the dealer's tables in the dealer's room.

02:00.160 --> 02:06.720
I just started going through some of the paperback books and I saw one of the covers that I remembered from when I was three years old or whatever.

02:07.480 --> 02:17.260
It was interesting to me because I hadn't been able, in retrospect, to pinpoint the exact time when I started really being fascinated by science fiction imagery.

02:18.080 --> 02:26.720
This book had been published in 1952 or 1953, so being born in 1950 pretty much establishes the beginning of that at around three years old or so.

02:28.560 --> 02:41.320
The fact that it meant so much to me that I remembered that exact cover until my present age, I said something about how it was just a part of me that that kind of imagery was important to me.

02:42.300 --> 02:49.700
Later when I began to read, I became an avid reader of all types of literature, but especially science fiction and fantasy.

02:50.680 --> 02:58.560
I had an interest in arts, so the two combined. It seemed natural to me to read and try to draw what I read.

02:59.040 --> 03:05.960
I would come home sometimes from science fiction movies or movies that I enjoyed and try to illustrate scenes that I'd seen in the movie from memory.

03:06.900 --> 03:10.140
That carried on pretty much into my college years.

03:20.940 --> 03:25.440
In college, Wayland had no plans on becoming an artist. He was, in fact, a pre-med student.

03:26.060 --> 03:35.180
In college, I had been laboring under the assumption that I had to have a real type of profession.

03:36.740 --> 03:45.720
This is largely due to the input from my parents, but I felt that I had to be something professional, like a lawyer, something respectable, which being an artist isn't.

03:48.680 --> 03:55.180
I was diverted during my college years into wanting to become a doctor, which is still a major interest in mine.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.840
Anatomy, physiology, and the sciences in general were always important to me.

04:00.520 --> 04:07.500
About three quarters of the way through my college education, I decided to abandon my pre-med training and go full scale.

04:07.880 --> 04:13.740
Well, actually, it wasn't until my last year of college that I decided full tilt to go into illustrating or painting.

04:13.740 --> 04:22.780
I graduated with a degree in painting. If I had taken one more course, I would have had a degree in biology with an emphasis on anatomy and physiology, human anatomy and physiology.

04:23.660 --> 04:27.280
Wayland pays special attention to the human form in his art. There's a reason for that.

04:27.960 --> 04:38.320
One of the jobs I had when I was putting myself through colleges working in the anatomy and physiology labs at the university I went to, preparing the cadavers for the classes.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.420
And during that time, I managed to get some work in doing medical illustrations.

04:42.860 --> 04:48.900
All this combined to really give me a good fundamental education in the way the body is made up.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.480
More next time with Michael Wayland.

04:58.640 --> 05:07.180
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:53.860 --> 05:54.380
The show is now available on the website.

05:54.380 --> 05:57.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:13.740 --> 06:18.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.120
And here are your posts.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.320
This is David Carson.

06:28.540 --> 06:29.160
And Daryl Lane.

06:29.360 --> 06:34.920
Hugo Award winning artist Michael Wayland has always been a reader of science fiction and fantasy. His love of the field inspires his work.

06:34.920 --> 06:38.320
Among other things, Wayland paints covers for science fiction and fantasy books.

06:38.700 --> 06:44.240
He's the most successful artist in his field right now, and if you're reading the science fiction at all, you've seen and admired one of his covers.

06:44.760 --> 06:48.700
How does Wayland come up with an idea for a book cover? Say for his well-known painting on Anne McCaffer.

06:50.360 --> 06:54.060
That's going back way. That's back in 77 or 78 when I did that.

06:54.860 --> 07:15.220
I read the book one time, just as a reader, and I go through it again the second time as an illustrator, making notes in margins about details of the way people and objects and things look, making sure that I try to catch all the details.

07:16.420 --> 07:27.000
So I don't make someone who's blonde, black-haired, or whatever, you know, because I like to be really true to the story as much as possible, especially if I'm taking a narrative approach to doing an illustration.

07:29.540 --> 07:43.460
After going through it that second time, I'll sit down and start to develop thumbnail sketches, which are just small drawings on scrap paper, actually, and try to find an idea of what I would like to illustrate from that book.

07:44.080 --> 07:54.900
There's usually something in any book, no matter how bad or good, that will make a good painting. It's a matter of digging through it and finding what I can do and what will motivate you to do a really good job.

07:56.360 --> 08:02.980
So I go through it and try to collate all my different ideas and put it together into a painting.

08:02.980 --> 08:16.260
That is a mysterious part that I can't really describe to you how that happens. I guess that's what makes me what I am, is that process there of distilling what I've read into something that's a visual image that captures what's in the book.

08:17.100 --> 08:23.740
That process takes a few days to do, and sometimes I get an instant image.

08:24.760 --> 08:33.280
The cover I just did for Robert A. Highline's book Friday, I had an instantaneous concept of what that cover was going to look like.

08:33.720 --> 08:47.740
As soon as I finished reading the book the first time, I had a perfectly clear idea of what Friday looked like, and I knew that the cover to this book had to be a portrait of this character because the character had such personality.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.740
The book was written around her personality, I think.

09:03.060 --> 09:06.200
If he ever gets any feedback from authors, whose book covers he's done?

09:07.300 --> 09:11.800
Yes, lots of time. In fact, with Friday I got a phone call from Robert A. Highline.

09:12.780 --> 09:22.680
A couple of months after I turned into the painting to Valentine Del Ray, they sent him a cover proof, which is a first run color tryout of what the cover is going to look like.

09:22.740 --> 09:34.960
He called me up to tell me it was a little flattery, I guess. He told me it was the best cover he ever had on a book of his, which is really quite a statement for someone who's been in the field as long as he has.

09:36.080 --> 09:44.940
To have an author tell me that I've captured a particular character or scene, exactly the way they had it in mind is probably, for me, the highest praise that an illustrator can get.

09:45.960 --> 09:52.560
That really had me floating up by the ceiling for a couple of weeks to think that he would bother to call me to tell me that.

09:53.640 --> 10:00.140
Sometimes before I do a painting I'll correspond with an author or talk to him or her on the phone to establish certain details.

10:00.140 --> 10:21.300
With the White Dragon, for example, I talked to Anne McCaffrey at length about the actual details of the dragons, as she saw the dragons in her book, whether they had forked tails or tails that ended in a point or whatever, or a barb or whatever, and what their skin was like and what the texture was, so that I could try to capture her image of what they looked like.

10:22.000 --> 10:32.080
It's kind of silly for someone who's an illustrator to try to make all that up when you can contact the author and get the details, if they're not in the book, straight from the person who found them out.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.720
We'll continue our conversation with Michael Whelan on our next show.

10:51.300 --> 10:51.660
The Texas.

11:40.340 --> 11:44.200
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:59.940 --> 12:05.180
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.520
And here are your hosts.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.580
This is Daryl Lane.

12:15.560 --> 12:21.600
Multiple award-winning science fiction artist Michael Whelan has done the cover art on many of the blockbusters in the science fiction and fantasy field recently.

12:22.060 --> 12:25.880
The cover painting for Anne McCaffrey's The White Dragon was probably his first well-known cover.

12:26.420 --> 12:33.100
Since then, he's done the art for Arthur Clark's 2010 Odyssey II, Robert Heinlein's Friday, and Isaac Asimov's Foundation's Edge.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.980
We asked Whelan if he has a favorite type of subject for his paintings.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.980
I think one thing that you can say about my work is that I try to cover all the fields.

12:41.940 --> 12:46.280
And that's because it's all, I don't have any particular favorite.

12:46.980 --> 12:49.540
I think I could say I have a favorite assignment each year.

12:50.280 --> 12:54.140
There's one assignment I get every year that's the one I look forward to.

12:54.500 --> 12:58.160
It's a regular thing now with the dog books, and that's the year's best horror story that's covered.

12:58.980 --> 13:01.380
It's a collection of horror stories, supposedly the year's best.

13:03.660 --> 13:05.600
And I have completely free reign.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.660
I often do with book covers, but especially with this one.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.280
And that's enjoyable to me.

13:13.580 --> 13:15.740
I like doing a good horror painting once in a while.

13:15.820 --> 13:18.180
I'm not a person who's interested in all the blood and guts.

13:20.460 --> 13:23.040
I equate that more with revulsion than I do with horror.

13:23.200 --> 13:23.640
They're different.

13:25.360 --> 13:29.740
But that is a lot of fun, and I've enjoyed doing that cover every year.

13:29.740 --> 13:31.640
That painting, I should say.

13:32.180 --> 13:35.780
I've come up with a few pretty scary ideas that never let me paint.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.100
Someday I'll do this for myself.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.680
That's only one aspect.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.540
I like, of course, the other aspects of science fiction and fantasy.

13:43.720 --> 13:50.360
I like the exploration of space, what they call hardware paintings with spaceships and all that.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.040
That's a lot of fun.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.780
I like to just kind of keep my fingers in all of it.

13:53.900 --> 13:58.560
I can't really say I have a, especially having a favorite field.

13:59.740 --> 14:04.000
Horror is one of them, and that particular job is probably my favorite assignment out of the year.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.940
But I can't say it's doing horror.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.240
It's something I like to do overdoing other things.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.540
We've all seen the God in attention getting covers in science fiction and fantasy books.

14:14.900 --> 14:17.320
Maybe you've even been influenced to buy a book because of its cover.

14:17.740 --> 14:20.180
We asked Waylon if a cover can sell a science fiction book.

14:20.980 --> 14:22.440
I honestly don't know.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.620
I really don't know.

14:24.860 --> 14:28.380
I've got, sometimes I think it makes a big difference, other times I don't.

14:29.720 --> 14:37.860
The fact that my career has gone where it has, and that sometimes I think it makes a big difference.

14:38.240 --> 14:43.060
The fact that I'm getting paid what I do and everything to do these covers,

14:43.220 --> 14:51.200
and that the publishers seem to think that my work sells books over just the title and the name of the author,

14:52.040 --> 14:55.100
makes me think sometimes that our work has a lot to do with that.

14:55.100 --> 14:59.320
There are other times when you'll see a bestseller that has an absolutely wretched cover,

14:59.660 --> 15:02.680
or has nothing but type on it that's selling quite well,

15:03.420 --> 15:06.780
then you think the cover art has absolutely nothing to do with it.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.120
So it's really hard to say.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.480
It's a balance, I think, between how famous the author is, how much publicity the book has gotten,

15:15.000 --> 15:21.220
and the expectations that people have had before the books have been published.

15:21.220 --> 15:28.520
A book like Foundations Edge, the foundation series by Isaac Jasmavich has a large readership.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.560
They've been waiting for this book and it's come out.

15:32.780 --> 15:39.760
They could have put a black cover with just the title Foundations Edge on it, and that thing would have sold off the shelf.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.120
But just to be sure, they've hired me to do the paperback cover for that book.

15:44.120 --> 15:57.480
But books that have very large publications have large budgets,

15:57.640 --> 15:59.860
and so they can afford to have a good cover for that.

16:00.740 --> 16:07.420
And I think that's why it's true, as the founder of Dell, he's asking the Dell Accord,

16:08.380 --> 16:10.100
don't remember his first name, anyway, he said,

16:10.820 --> 16:15.320
what you do is when you have a good painter, good cover artist,

16:15.560 --> 16:17.960
use them for your best book or your worst book.

16:18.940 --> 16:22.320
As the top cover artist working today, Waylon gets a lot of both types.

16:29.740 --> 16:32.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:32.080 --> 16:35.040
production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:35.280 --> 16:38.200
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.360
Thank you.

17:48.480 --> 17:54.440
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:57.060 --> 17:58.760
And here are your hosts.

18:02.980 --> 18:04.120
This is David Carson.

18:04.320 --> 18:04.920
And Daryl Lane.

18:05.200 --> 18:09.560
Richard Curtis is a New York literary agent who represents a number of today's most popular science fiction authors.

18:10.080 --> 18:14.840
He also writes a column for Locust Magazine, the best known publication in the science fiction and fantasy field.

18:15.120 --> 18:20.560
The column is called Agents Corner, and it's full of advice for any kind of author, not just science fiction and fantasy writers.

18:20.940 --> 18:22.700
We asked Curtis about the origin of his column.

18:22.700 --> 18:33.540
Well, about two and a half years ago, I was invited to address a group of authors,

18:34.160 --> 18:48.280
American Society of Journalists and Authors, and I chose to talk to them about certain contractual clauses that I thought might be pitfalls for most professional authors.

18:49.120 --> 19:00.460
In the questioning that followed, I found an appalling ignorance on the part of authors on the subject of contracts.

19:01.520 --> 19:07.580
And many of these people are highly respected professional journalists and book authors,

19:08.080 --> 19:17.340
and yet it was clear to me that they didn't know anything, or very much I should say, about how to read a contract, how to negotiate one,

19:17.340 --> 19:21.180
and how to alter a clause to their own benefit.

19:21.860 --> 19:28.940
And so I decided to write a column for the many other writers who probably are in the same position.

19:29.620 --> 19:38.680
And I asked Charles Brown, the editor of Locust, a publisher of Locust, I guess, whether he'd be interested in publishing it.

19:38.680 --> 19:51.800
And he was quite agreeable. And thereafter, a number of magazines, newsletters published by other writers groups such as Western Writers of America,

19:53.100 --> 20:01.600
romance writers of America, and mystery writers of America took on the column because they felt their authors were in the same position.

20:02.400 --> 20:06.320
We asked Curtis if he would mind telling us some of the science fiction authors he represents.

20:06.320 --> 20:13.520
Well, no, I don't mind at all. It's, I think, a fairly common knowledge in the science fiction community.

20:14.200 --> 20:34.480
We represent Harlan Ellison, Gregory Benford, Greg Behr, Elizabeth Lynn, Marta Randall, Barry Longhear, Warren Norwood, Jessica Sammonson.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.680
And I'd say three or four more.

20:44.220 --> 20:49.840
Since Curtis represents all sorts of authors who write for the paperbacks, we asked him about the popularity of genre literature,

20:50.080 --> 20:53.040
such as Westerns, romances, mysteries, science fiction, and so forth.

20:53.400 --> 20:57.800
The publishers, for instance, create the market for these books and thereby, in a sense, determine readers' taste.

20:57.800 --> 21:09.140
It's hard to say. Sometimes the publishers create the taste, and sometimes the market, the consumer, creates the demand.

21:10.020 --> 21:19.940
And sometimes it's the agent. For instance, I find myself very often in speaking to publishers, I find myself in a double role.

21:20.660 --> 21:30.020
I keep my ears open and try to listen to what a publisher tells me about what he's able to sell and what he's not able to sell.

21:30.460 --> 21:39.260
And so I have a kind of passive role in that I pass along to authors what the publishers tell me the market is doing.

21:39.260 --> 21:50.420
However, if I begin to notice a trend, I then try to help create a market by turning to other publishers and saying,

21:50.620 --> 22:02.540
listen, I've had lunch the last couple of months with four publishers, and they all tell me that hard science fiction is not as active as fantasy and source and sorcery.

22:03.580 --> 22:07.420
And so maybe you'd be interested in some source and sorcery.

22:07.420 --> 22:13.480
So an agent is in the position of shaping the market once it begins to detect the trend.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.500
More next time with Agent Richard Curtis.

22:23.660 --> 22:32.380
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:20.380 --> 23:24.340
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:40.460 --> 23:45.740
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.260
And here are your hosts.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.560
This is Daryl Lane.

23:55.800 --> 23:56.480
And David Carson.

23:56.860 --> 24:02.840
Richard Curtis has been a literary agent for over 25 years, and he represents some of today's most popular science fiction and fantasy authors.

24:02.840 --> 24:09.240
He also writes a column in the Science Fiction magazine, Locus, which contains all sorts of practical advice for writers of any genre.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.900
Many science fiction fans, of course, have often wondered if they could make it as writers.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.800
We asked Curtis if he had any advice for aspiring science fiction or fantasy authors.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.840
Always begin with the magazines.

24:21.020 --> 24:32.820
You're absolutely right about science fiction fans being more fanatic, but they are also fortunate in having a place with a writer.

24:32.840 --> 24:41.580
They can begin in the shorter media where most writers in other genres don't have the chance.

24:41.940 --> 24:46.920
I mean, there are very few places where a romance writer can contieve.

24:47.920 --> 24:56.280
You know, you can't write romance short stories unless you try to write for some of the Slicker Women's magazines.

24:56.560 --> 25:01.240
And they're, of course, very demanding in what they accept.

25:02.100 --> 25:11.120
There used to be Western magazines, many, many of them, but those, almost all of them, are gone now.

25:12.020 --> 25:22.520
Mystery magazines were still a couple of them, but it's not like what it used to be when I got into the business about 25 years ago.

25:22.520 --> 25:31.920
So one of the few remaining genres that invites new talent and cultivates it is science fiction,

25:32.060 --> 25:39.140
where you have very active magazine market and anthology market for original stories.

25:40.300 --> 25:45.220
Besides this advice, Curtis says there's one particular aspect of science fiction that can also help a beginning writer.

25:46.400 --> 25:54.080
You also have conventions, of course Western writers, romance writers, mystery writers also have their conventions,

25:54.480 --> 26:02.040
but certainly science fiction writers can out-convention anybody by ratio of 10 to 1.

26:02.480 --> 26:10.080
So there's a lot of interplay where authors are always talking to one another,

26:10.080 --> 26:19.420
meeting editors, meeting professional writers, and there's a much tighter unity than there is in any other genre.

26:20.020 --> 26:28.900
So I would definitely advise any aspiring science fiction writer to start writing in the magazine.

26:28.900 --> 26:41.260
In fact, even some of my well-known clients, I still tell them to continue writing for science fiction magazines,

26:41.480 --> 26:48.380
even though they may get peanuts for their work compared to what they can get writing books,

26:48.700 --> 26:57.680
because the exposure among both science fiction editors and science fiction fans is terribly important.

26:58.460 --> 27:03.140
Regular readers of science fiction and fantasy have certainly noticed a great number of trilogies in the past few years.

27:03.700 --> 27:07.760
Right, it almost seems as if authors plan on writing a three-book series when they begin a novel.

27:08.280 --> 27:11.680
We ask Curtis if he is an agent, like to receive trilogies from his authors.

27:12.400 --> 27:22.320
The beauty of a trilogy, of course, is from an agency point, is in the kind of package deal that one can make

27:22.320 --> 27:31.900
where you not only sign an autograph for a book, but you can sign him up for a sequel and a sequel after that.

27:32.740 --> 27:36.580
And the author knows where he's going to be two years from now.

27:36.660 --> 27:43.920
The publisher knows what he can expect over a couple of years, and unless the author one day runs out of steam

27:43.920 --> 27:48.900
or gets bored with the characters that he developed in book one or two,

27:50.600 --> 28:00.160
you can see a cumulative effect in the sales of a trilogy where publication of book two makes people scurry for book one,

28:00.440 --> 28:06.040
and publication of book three causes the publisher to reissue books one and two,

28:06.480 --> 28:11.820
and then they put them in a box set and they're reviewed as a whole.

28:12.100 --> 28:18.080
It's a very nice way of publishing books, but not everybody has a sequel in them.

28:25.460 --> 28:31.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:31.520 --> 28:34.600
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.480
Thank you.
