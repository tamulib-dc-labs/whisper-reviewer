WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:08.040
Okay, back up just a little bit and let's just change directions.

00:08.640 --> 00:09.000
Alright.

00:10.900 --> 00:18.460
There must be a bit of the actress in order to do the things on stage that you do.

00:19.740 --> 00:20.520
Of course.

00:21.280 --> 00:28.040
But actually, I think there's a bit of actress or actor in almost everyone who's into the

00:28.040 --> 00:31.080
fandom scene at all and even people who aren't.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.980
It's just a matter of whether we can actually do something with it or not.

00:35.180 --> 00:37.980
A lot of people just assume, well, that'll never happen.

00:38.060 --> 00:41.100
I'll never get to do anything with it and they forget about that part of their personality.

00:41.560 --> 00:42.500
I'm a little more stubborn.

00:42.680 --> 00:47.480
I intend to do it professionally eventually and to some extent I'm doing that now with

00:47.480 --> 00:53.420
my performing as a singer and dancer with the singing telegram companies and as a model

00:53.420 --> 00:54.140
and so forth.

00:54.140 --> 00:59.640
I've been in two science fiction movies as an extra, Loebens Run and Laid of Heaven,

00:59.900 --> 01:01.320
which both were a lot of fun.

01:02.040 --> 01:06.240
But it doesn't take an actor or an actress to do these kind of things and I've seen a

01:06.240 --> 01:11.740
lot of really wonderful skits and costumes and performances pulled off by people who

01:11.740 --> 01:15.980
had never even considered the idea of being professional actors or actresses.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.340
They just want to make it real.

01:17.680 --> 01:22.640
That's all acting ever was, was just trying to make something real and recreate something.

01:23.100 --> 01:26.360
It's just that what we do is a little different than your typical stage play.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.980
But it should be no less entertaining and we're trying to create it so that it's no

01:30.980 --> 01:31.700
less entertaining.

01:37.100 --> 01:42.540
When you got into this, were there any resources that you drew upon or to learn how to do what

01:42.540 --> 01:43.260
you're doing now?

01:43.620 --> 01:45.260
I still don't know what I'm doing now.

01:47.900 --> 01:53.400
I've learned a lot from other people and from lots of trial and error, mostly trial

01:53.400 --> 01:53.940
and error.

01:54.540 --> 02:00.140
I discovered fabric glue when I was in desperation and it works wonderfully on all kinds of things.

02:01.080 --> 02:05.360
When I started costuming, I really didn't know anything about sewing at all.

02:06.060 --> 02:11.640
The idea of making clothes was the farthest thing from my mind and it just happened that

02:11.640 --> 02:14.960
I needed a costume and I had to figure out how to create this thing that you couldn't

02:14.960 --> 02:17.160
possibly buy in a store by its very nature.

02:18.340 --> 02:21.240
The first costumes were very much trial and error.

02:21.860 --> 02:25.560
But since then I've learned a lot of shortcuts, shortcuts that an average seamstress would

02:25.560 --> 02:28.640
probably never use because they learned all the rules and I didn't.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.380
I try to pass on those shortcuts and a lot of the major conventions, they have workshops

02:34.940 --> 02:40.220
where they discuss costuming and shortcuts that other people have find and stage techniques

02:40.220 --> 02:45.560
and there are books and magazines out that cover costuming and make up and easy ways to

02:45.560 --> 02:46.520
do all these things.

02:47.020 --> 02:51.640
And eventually I did break down and take a class in costuming at my university because

02:51.640 --> 02:56.020
as a drama major I had to but by that time I pretty well had figured most of it out for

02:56.020 --> 02:56.440
myself.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.200
But there's some wonderful books you can get at the local library which can tell you how

03:02.200 --> 03:03.860
to do almost anything you want to do.

03:06.040 --> 03:11.220
This must be kind of infectious because you said you had a group that did this and you've

03:11.220 --> 03:15.940
had people that help you so you kind of get together with other people and they think

03:15.940 --> 03:19.000
this is nice and so you've got another convert to the...

03:19.000 --> 03:24.160
Oh yes, we don't have anyone who's ever met or joined our group that hasn't immediately

03:24.160 --> 03:25.460
ended up in a costume.

03:26.160 --> 03:31.520
Sometimes under protest the first time but they always end up under a costume and then

03:31.520 --> 03:37.420
they always want more and more costumes and the next thing you know we've got a whole

03:37.420 --> 03:38.480
new set of costumers.

03:38.960 --> 03:43.560
When we went to Boston we took five people in four different costume skits.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.100
These five people I was the only one who had ever been to a world com before.

03:48.580 --> 03:50.980
Most of them had never even been to a major convention before.

03:51.220 --> 03:53.680
All they knew was they wanted to do the masquerade.

03:54.020 --> 03:58.520
They loved science fiction and fantasy and fandom and they wanted to do the masquerade

03:58.520 --> 04:02.340
and they had a lot of creativity and they were willing to listen to suggestions and

04:02.340 --> 04:06.060
we all worked together and we came away with four awards.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.960
People who nobody had ever heard of before, we went up there to the world con and won

04:10.960 --> 04:12.080
four of the top awards.

04:12.740 --> 04:18.500
Best presentation overall, first runner up for best presentation, Star Wars special award

04:18.500 --> 04:21.440
prize and first runner up for best fantasy.

04:23.020 --> 04:25.800
And immediately everyone wanted to know about Texas.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.900
They had never realized there were so many costumers in Texas and these were all basically

04:29.900 --> 04:35.160
newbies and none of the costumes were extremely complex but the ideas around the costumes

04:35.160 --> 04:39.460
were good and good enough to catch the imagination of the audience and that's where it's at is

04:39.460 --> 04:39.980
the idea.

04:40.200 --> 04:46.380
If you've got an idea it doesn't matter if you're a virtuoso at the seamstress stuff

04:46.380 --> 04:50.280
as long as the idea is something that will catch and hold an audience.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.060
Use the term newbies.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.000
Newbies.

04:54.160 --> 04:54.500
Newbies.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.040
Newbies.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.120
She's been using a few fan, the fan vocabulary.

04:59.120 --> 04:59.780
Yeah that's why.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.640
Somebody just make a fan vocabulary dictionary.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.120
There is one I'm sure.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.280
I've seen one anyway.

05:05.740 --> 05:05.880
Yeah.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.060
Let's talk a bit about fandom.

05:12.040 --> 05:17.020
We're gonna have to give a, you have spoken to it on a couple of, let's stop the tape.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.780
There are actually several different level of fans.

05:24.420 --> 05:29.520
There are new fan which are people who just discovered that oh you mean there's somebody

05:29.520 --> 05:31.660
else that reads this stuff besides me.

05:32.220 --> 05:38.060
There are true fan who are the people who go to conventions on a live and die situation

05:38.060 --> 05:44.040
and fandom is a way of life and will sell whatever they can sell at the dealer's tables

05:44.040 --> 05:48.680
if they can make enough money to get back and forth between the conventions and who

05:48.680 --> 05:52.800
literally the convention society is their social life.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.680
Then there are a whole scope of people in between.

05:56.140 --> 06:00.600
There are what we call closet fans who are the people who read the books, who watch the

06:00.600 --> 06:05.360
shows, who go to the movies but who have absolutely no idea that there's any kind of organization

06:05.360 --> 06:06.280
out there whatsoever.

06:07.420 --> 06:12.980
There are the slightly organized fans which are people who realize that there is organization

06:12.980 --> 06:17.620
who maybe go to a con every now and then, who every now and then get a chance to meet

06:17.620 --> 06:21.100
their favorite author but who really aren't that much into the convention scene.

06:21.260 --> 06:24.180
It's just something that they like and every now and then they like to express the fact

06:24.180 --> 06:24.980
that they enjoy it.

06:25.460 --> 06:30.420
Then of course there are the professional fan which are people who through their professions

06:30.420 --> 06:34.860
one way or the other have somehow gotten tied up with the science fiction or fantasy genre

06:35.520 --> 06:40.660
and because they deal with it every day or part of every day and because they must like

06:40.660 --> 06:43.060
it or they wouldn't deal with it to some extent, they're fan too.

06:43.060 --> 06:48.380
A lot of the writers who write the stuff are actually fans who although they're professionals

06:48.380 --> 06:49.940
and write the things, they like it.

06:50.680 --> 06:56.440
If you like something then you're a fan of it by the strictest definition and it just depends

06:56.440 --> 06:57.880
on the level of that definition.

06:58.520 --> 07:03.280
Then of course there's always the subgenre that we try to ignore which is your space cadets.

07:04.460 --> 07:09.120
We call them space cadets because these are the kitty type mentalities.

07:09.120 --> 07:14.240
Fortunately most of them are children and unfortunately some of them aren't who think

07:14.240 --> 07:19.760
fans are just a way to play shoot them up Buck Rogers with other people and have missed

07:19.760 --> 07:23.620
the point of what fandom is about but they're a part of fandom too and you can't exclude them.

07:24.540 --> 07:27.900
There are many other levels of fandom that have no name.

07:28.540 --> 07:34.920
A person who just likes maybe one story or one aspect of fandom but they like that very much

07:34.920 --> 07:38.780
and they maybe illustrate it or try to copy it or something like that.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.960
They're a fan even though they may not realize it.

07:44.860 --> 07:46.240
Good explanation of fandom.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.340
Yeah that's another show to it's end.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.040
Yeah, you used it a whole show.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.020
And fan is the plural of fan.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.780
Right, fan is the plural of fan.

07:56.360 --> 07:56.580
Yeah.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.200
Otherwise we'll ask about filking then.

07:59.420 --> 08:01.660
Oh damn, we got to know about filksening.

08:02.900 --> 08:08.580
I'm curious, yeah tell us about filksening, the fact that it exists and what is it?

08:08.960 --> 08:17.820
Well basically like any other, when you take fandom as a microcosm of people and that this is their social life when they're at a convention

08:17.820 --> 08:23.160
you have to deal with the fact that social life includes entertainment.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.860
And if you're into science fiction and fantasy and you're doing something special like a convention

08:28.440 --> 08:32.400
you don't want to go out and entertain yourself by going to the local bar or the local disco.

08:32.620 --> 08:33.220
That's boring.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.180
You want to do something that's uniquely fandom.

08:36.300 --> 08:40.880
And so something that was developed through fandom is a thing called filksinging.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.600
Filksinging is folksinging sort of.

08:44.720 --> 08:53.960
Basically filksinging is a creation of songs that are performed by one person or many person on or off key.

08:53.960 --> 08:54.800
It makes no difference.

08:55.320 --> 09:02.020
That were written specifically for the audience of science fiction and fantasy listeners.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.760
And there are a lot of sing along songs.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.760
Some of them are very silly and very stupid but some of them are very serious and very beautiful.

09:09.320 --> 09:14.760
And it's a form of entertainment strictly for science fiction and fantasy audiences.

09:15.040 --> 09:21.100
You know you would never find them on the top ten unless all of a sudden the national fad happened to turn that direction.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.680
But a very viable art form.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.820
Now some of filksinging is very simple.

09:27.960 --> 09:35.200
It simply involves taking a tune from a normal song and changing the words around to have something to do with science fiction or fantasy.

09:35.740 --> 09:40.700
And usually those are funny and they're the kind that you can get a lot of giggles off and everyone joins in.

09:41.000 --> 09:50.480
But the more serious element is original songs that deal with very serious ideas like the fact that man's finally reaching for space

09:50.480 --> 09:58.820
and the Columbia's here or the fact that when are we really going to get to be dancing on the moon by the time it actually happens I'll be too old.

09:59.340 --> 10:00.800
And things like that.

10:01.180 --> 10:06.320
And filking is a whole type of folk singing strictly for fans.

10:07.340 --> 10:13.960
And some fans don't like it because they don't like the taking of other people's music and putting other lyrics to it.

10:13.960 --> 10:21.320
But for most fans it's a wonderful outlet for getting to know other people and just sit around at night when there's nothing else to do and sing songs

10:21.320 --> 10:28.340
and get a very close type of camaraderie that you only get in some other kind of very close knit group.

10:28.640 --> 10:36.260
Not all conventions have filksinging but the more intimate ones where it really is a social life type situation do.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.560
Because it's a very big part of the social life.

10:39.380 --> 10:47.520
Partying is a very big part of the social life too and that usually starts before and after the folk singing and is a whole separate thing altogether.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.080
But partying is a part of everybody's social life no matter what they do.

10:53.180 --> 10:54.880
Do you want to get back on the track now?

10:55.580 --> 10:57.260
No, no those are good.

10:58.440 --> 11:02.880
We're trying to do some more stuff on fandom because it is a big part of it.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.960
And fandom because you were in it.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.400
Remember what it was like before fandom?

11:07.920 --> 11:08.320
Oh yes.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.240
You know what there was such a thing?

11:09.420 --> 11:09.900
Oh yes.

11:10.060 --> 11:14.780
Well 95 or greater percent of the population lives in that particular area.

11:14.780 --> 11:16.000
Exactly, exactly.

11:16.620 --> 11:21.180
You know science fiction fandom is different than being a football fan.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.700
Oh much, oh much.

11:25.540 --> 11:28.560
So these shows are probably pretty interesting.

11:28.560 --> 11:40.860
There seems to be a bit of animosity, I don't know from the Trekkies versus the science fiction fans.

11:41.520 --> 11:48.540
I've seen it at science fiction conventions where Trekkie is synonymous with Kadele Dahl or something.

11:48.960 --> 11:55.140
Well actually you have to understand the history of that and I explain most of it.

11:55.140 --> 12:04.160
Basically what happened is in the beginning before there was Star Trek, which Star Trek is not just a history of media thing,

12:04.620 --> 12:12.120
you know a major phenomenon in media but it's also a main timeline, drawing line in the history of science fiction and fantasy fandom.

12:12.820 --> 12:24.400
And before Trekk there was still fandom but it was almost exclusively literary fandom strictly oriented towards the writers and the things they wrote.

12:24.400 --> 12:33.620
And very small groupings, you know conventions had maybe 200 people where nowadays it's not unusual to go to one with 8000.

12:34.720 --> 12:42.180
And it was a very small informal group of writers and the people who liked what they wrote who were their fans.

12:42.820 --> 12:50.960
Then Star Trek came along and all of a sudden a whole world of people who'd never occurred to them that such a thing as science fiction existed

12:51.560 --> 12:58.700
were exposed to it and they were exposed to it in such a way where they discovered that they liked it because it was people caring about people

12:58.700 --> 13:05.760
and it was exploring problems and situations that you can't explore in average everyday mundane life.

13:06.000 --> 13:13.800
You know like for example to quote one of the episodes in one of the episodes a man is brought face to face with his evil half

13:13.800 --> 13:19.320
and you have his good half and his evil half and he's forced to cope with the idea that they're both him.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.860
And it's done in a very graphic way that you could never do in a non-science fiction story.

13:24.440 --> 13:30.140
And so this caught a lot of people's imagination and a huge following grew up around the show.

13:30.480 --> 13:37.060
And then they discovered conventions. They started out by making their own Star Trek convention which was nothing but Star Trek

13:37.060 --> 13:40.960
and had none of the regular science fiction or fantasy with it.

13:40.960 --> 13:49.860
And then they started sort of moving in on the regular conventions where they'd start showing up because they would discover that science fiction was there too

13:49.860 --> 13:54.680
and they weren't just in love with Trek. It was just their first love and they discovered science fiction through it.

13:54.780 --> 14:00.880
I'm one of these. I had read it before but I didn't really discover science fiction instilled until Star Trek

14:01.480 --> 14:05.100
but I did not feel at this point that that makes me a Trekkie and I'll explain that in a minute.

14:05.100 --> 14:16.080
But they started moving in on the other types of fandom and the grassroots of fandom looked at this influx of video junkies

14:16.080 --> 14:23.440
and said, my God, these are the Trekkies, you know, and they treated them like a base level set because to them they were

14:23.440 --> 14:29.080
because they didn't start with the original literature. They started from the hand-fed media of television.

14:29.080 --> 14:37.020
Now since then that has died down for the most part because most Star Trek fans have just used that as a jumping board

14:37.020 --> 14:45.820
into the literary levels of science fiction and fantasy and while they're still Star Trek fans, they still are very much in love with all the other areas as well

14:45.820 --> 14:51.420
and therefore are not Trekkies and are not just going to die from Mr. Spock's ears or something.

14:51.800 --> 14:58.640
But we still have a large influx of the people who haven't discovered the literary branch of the genre and only know the media branch

14:58.640 --> 15:05.380
and it's still unfortunately largely looked down on by the people who are mostly into the literary branch.

15:07.200 --> 15:13.700
But it is changing every day because Star Trek is after all 11 years old

15:13.700 --> 15:20.880
and most of the people who were Trekkies have long ago changed where their influence is

15:20.880 --> 15:32.180
and so for the most part that kind of Ru-Ha-Ha is gone except by the die-hard fans who still feel that if there's more than 200 people

15:32.180 --> 15:35.280
and if you're not strictly there for the literature then you're not a true fan.

15:38.380 --> 15:39.120
15 years old.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.560
16 years old.

15:40.740 --> 15:41.700
Wasn't it fall of 66?

15:42.020 --> 15:42.840
66, yeah.

15:42.940 --> 15:44.680
Yeah, we're getting old.

15:45.000 --> 15:45.420
Yeah, yeah.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.280
And I didn't discover it until the first reruns.

15:50.640 --> 15:54.200
I was unfortunately a senior in high school when it started.

15:54.700 --> 15:55.580
Yeah, I was too.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.500
Or somewhere.

16:02.760 --> 16:10.500
See, we've covered costuming and we've covered masquerade and we've covered different kinds of costuming at cons.

16:13.820 --> 16:18.620
We've covered fandom, milk singing, what else?

16:18.880 --> 16:19.060
Pardon?

16:19.580 --> 16:19.920
Pardon?

16:20.180 --> 16:24.640
Is there anything that does anything occur to you that might not be obvious?

16:27.680 --> 16:28.500
Yeah, I got one.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.860
Let's go back to costuming for a little bit.

16:30.400 --> 16:37.200
Whenever you're putting a costume together, some of the accru-

16:37.200 --> 16:38.540
Accru-termists?

16:38.660 --> 16:39.320
Accru-termists, I think.

16:39.320 --> 16:46.480
Accru-termists that you are wearing are not your standard Fred's clothing store items.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.060
Where do you go about finding them?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.080
Anywhere I can.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.760
I love thrift stores.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.080
Thrift stores are wonderful.

16:53.420 --> 16:57.060
People turn junk into the thrift store that is some of the most beautiful brocades,

16:57.780 --> 17:01.740
something that will pass for a Celtic pendant that somebody's great-great-grandmother wore,

17:02.220 --> 17:03.380
and it's not in styles.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.500
They throw it out and it's wonderful on a costume.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.880
As a matter of fact, I started my jewelry collecting by going to thrift stores,

17:10.420 --> 17:11.560
and started a lot of-

17:11.560 --> 17:15.500
As a matter of fact, a lot of the costumes that I still use were gotten by going to a thrift store

17:15.500 --> 17:19.980
discovering somebody had made a dress and thrown it away because it wasn't in style,

17:19.980 --> 17:22.760
but it happened to be absolutely perfect for the year 1100.

17:23.240 --> 17:28.860
And so I would buy it for 50 cents and put some trim on it and redo it so it was exactly right.

17:28.980 --> 17:33.460
Take the zipper out and put lace in or ties to tie it up the back so it was proper.

17:33.460 --> 17:37.080
And I had a costume for 50 cents plus the cost of the trim.

17:38.820 --> 17:42.000
And there are places where you can get costume material.

17:42.260 --> 17:46.700
A lot of stores, costume stores have things you can use, but for the most part,

17:46.980 --> 17:49.220
it's just thrift stores, flea markets.

17:50.740 --> 17:57.240
If you're into a particular era, for example, there's a lot of medievalists who are very much in the medieval era

17:57.240 --> 17:58.520
for their fantasy costumes.

17:59.080 --> 18:02.740
You can get medieval jewelry shipped in from Scotland and England.

18:02.940 --> 18:08.320
As a matter of fact, when I have a dealer's table, I sell jewelry that is imported from Scotland and England

18:08.320 --> 18:11.000
that is recreations of the actual old jewelry.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.500
And the only place it would be popular is at conventions and medieval events,

18:15.760 --> 18:19.760
but here because the people can't find it, I'm doing them a service by supplying it.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.740
And there are other people who do the same sort of thing.

18:24.080 --> 18:28.240
Fabric outlets are wonderful when you are looking for a particular look of fabric.

18:28.900 --> 18:34.060
There are certain kinds of specialty stores that have certain special kinds of fabric design,

18:34.180 --> 18:37.700
just for costuming that are wonderful places to haunt.

18:38.140 --> 18:41.340
And just about every metropolitan area has one.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.260
You just have to really search to find where it is.

18:44.880 --> 18:49.660
Grodge sales are wonderful because the average non-fan mundane person,

18:49.660 --> 18:53.580
when they have something that's maybe strictly oriented towards costume,

18:53.700 --> 18:57.220
is not necessarily going to want to keep it around because they don't have anything they can do with it.

18:57.520 --> 19:02.400
And so you can get some really nice costume pieces for 50 cents a dollar, maybe $2.

19:03.620 --> 19:07.860
Johnny had to have a King Arthur outfit for the last play and it's all done

19:07.860 --> 19:11.900
and they don't want it anymore so it's out on the rack for sale and things like that.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.180
But a large part of it you have to create.

19:16.180 --> 19:19.160
And there are all kinds of shortcuts for creating it.

19:19.280 --> 19:24.560
I can make and have made on occasion, I've made armor for masquerade type costumes

19:24.560 --> 19:27.520
out of cardboard and wrapping paper foil.

19:27.900 --> 19:33.080
And on the stage you cannot tell that it is not really gold armor or silver armor or whatever.

19:33.760 --> 19:40.020
Wood putty, if there's something that you want that you can't make like the Boris paintings

19:40.020 --> 19:46.020
that are so well known, a lot of his characters wear jewelry that is impossible to really get created

19:46.020 --> 19:49.840
out of metal but it looks wonderful so you can make it out of wood putty and spray paint it

19:49.840 --> 19:51.860
or cover it with foil, it looks just like metal jewelry.

19:52.460 --> 19:57.620
There's a lot of shortcuts you can take and it's a lot of fun because you can just open up your imagination

19:57.620 --> 20:03.080
and let it run wild as far as, well let's see, this is the look I want, what can I use to make it out of?

20:03.380 --> 20:04.820
Oh well, let's try paper mache.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.240
Gee, that works.

20:06.780 --> 20:13.080
Or wood putty again like I said, all kinds of glues and resins.

20:13.080 --> 20:20.560
And of course you can go and use the things that they actually use in the studios and use things like latex

20:20.560 --> 20:27.300
and plaster but it takes a bit of training to learn how to use those although those are the most effective ways

20:27.300 --> 20:28.940
of making things that you can't buy.

20:31.060 --> 20:36.360
Of course there are those of us who go around and make things for people who can't make them themselves

20:36.360 --> 20:42.200
like if Johnny wants a cloak and he has no idea how to make the one, he can buy one from a person

20:42.200 --> 20:47.740
such as me who goes around making them simply because there is no place you can walk into the store and buy one.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.820
I mean there are no cloaks to fuzz and delts.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.880
Yes, Neiman Marcus, $5,000.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.680
That's about it, that's about it.
