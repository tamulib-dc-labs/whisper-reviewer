00:01.820 --> 00:13.800
Interview with Michael Collins coming in 3, 2, 1. My guest today is Michael
Collins, who was the command module pilot on Apollo 11, that historic flight 15

00:13.800 --> 00:23.600
years ago when man first walked on the surface of the moon. Mr. Collins, when
did you join the space program? I joined the space program in January of 1964,

00:25.600 --> 00:33.920
slightly over 20 years ago, although it doesn't seem that long. What was going
on in the space program at the time, and why were you motivated to go into it?

00:34.080 --> 00:47.640
Well, I joined right after Mercury and before Gemini, and that was in the days
when NASA was looking for test pilots to be astronauts, and I was a test pilot

00:47.640 --> 00:57.860
out at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and the idea of working for NASA and
flying a little higher and a little faster was very appealing to me. What was it

00:57.860 --> 01:09.540
like then to be an astronaut? They were very busy and they were very exciting
times. I was in the third group of astronauts. There first was a group of seven,

01:09.700 --> 01:22.940
then a group of nine, and then the third group of 14, making a total of 30
people. So we were small enough that we knew each other all very well, and we

01:22.940 --> 01:34.940
were working together very well as a team, and we were spending most of our time
in the early days looking at the design of the Gemini and the design of the

01:34.940 --> 01:44.720
Apollo to make sure that they made sense from the pilot's point of view, the
people who were going to be operating that very complicated equipment. We had

01:44.720 --> 01:54.260
more to do than there were hours in the day. It was very busy. We were doing a
lot of traveling. It was a very interesting and exciting time. You flew on one

01:54.260 --> 02:08.080
of the Gemini missions, right? Could you describe that? Yes, I flew with John
Young on Gemini 10 in July of 1966, and it was a three-day flight designed

02:08.080 --> 02:22.620
primarily to check out the practicality of various rendezvous procedures. We had
an Agena launched a couple of hours before us, and we took off from Cape Kennedy

02:22.620 --> 02:35.000
and found the Agena in the sky and rendezvoused and docked with it, and then we
used its power, its engine, to boost us up into a higher orbit where we found a

02:35.000 --> 02:48.220
second Agena, one that had been up there for several months and was electrically
dead, an inert Agena, and we made a rendezvous with it using entirely optical

02:48.220 --> 03:01.080
techniques. In other words, it didn't have any capability of responding to our
radar, so we made two rendezvous, one using radar with our own Agena and one

03:01.080 --> 03:13.720
without radar on this inert Agena, and then I made a spacewalk over to the
second Agena and retrieved from it a scientific package, which we returned to

03:13.720 --> 03:23.900
the Gemini and then subsequently back to Earth. It was a very, very busy flight.
We really had more to do in three days than we could shoehorn in, and it was

03:23.900 --> 03:33.860
very exciting. How do you compare spacewalking then to spacewalking now? For
example, the spacewalks that were conducted by Bruce McCandless and Pinky Nelson

03:33.860 --> 03:48.740
in previous space shuttle missions when they used the man-maneuvering units.
Well, our equipment was not nearly as fancy or good or complicated as the

03:48.740 --> 04:03.560
equipment they have now. We didn't know as many things. For example, instead of
that gigantic backpack, which McCandless wore, I had a small handheld gun-like

04:03.560 --> 04:18.600
device which squirted out little jets of cold gas. The difference is I had to
point it in precisely the right direction or I would miss my target or I would

04:18.600 --> 04:31.580
start, if I didn't hold it in proper alignment with my body, I would start
tumbling in the McCandless equipment. There are gyroscopes and automatic devices

04:31.580 --> 04:42.920
to prevent those things. So ours was very crude and rudimentary compared to the
equipment they have now. Of course, ours was also a lot smaller, which it had to

04:42.920 --> 04:51.100
be on the Gemini because it itself was a very small machine. Would you like to
spacewalk now with all this new technology? Oh, I would. I'd love to, yes. I

04:51.100 --> 04:52.160
think that would be wonderful.

04:54.800 --> 05:06.400
The backpack is almost a miniature spacecraft itself and I think it would be a
great deal of fun to motor scooter around the sky in the vicinity of the shuttle

05:06.400 --> 05:16.760
and I'd love to do that. Let's go back to the Gemini program. Well, the Gemini
program was a very nice program. It's not well remembered today because it fell

05:16.760 --> 05:28.120
in the shadow of Apollo, but we really could not have had Apollo or Apollo could
not have been as successful as it was had there not been a Gemini program.

05:29.180 --> 05:40.180
Gemini was required really to do three things. The first thing was to prove that
rendezvous and docking in space was practical because the Apollo scheme required

05:40.180 --> 05:51.480
that the Apollo spaceship break itself into two pieces, one piece to land on the
moon, the second piece to remain in lunar orbit. For this scheme to be

05:51.480 --> 06:03.880
successful, it was necessary that we have a safe and a practical rendezvous, a
procedure for bringing these two pieces back together. The second was to prove

06:03.880 --> 06:15.320
that you could stay in space for long enough in weightlessness to make the trip
from the earth to the moon and back again without any deleterious effect on the

06:15.320 --> 06:24.620
human body. And then the third thing was if you are going to go land on the
moon, you have to operate outside on the surface independent of the vehicle

06:24.620 --> 06:37.360
itself. And Gemini was designed to give us some experience in extravehicular
operations or spacewalking. Then those three things, rendezvous, long duration,

06:37.740 --> 06:50.900
and extravehicular activities were the main reasons for Gemini's being. And it
did prove that all three of those things were practical. And it led then very

06:50.900 --> 07:01.820
logically into Apollo. After Gemini, you began working in the Apollo program and
you became a specialist in the command module part of the Apollo equipment. What

07:01.820 --> 07:16.920
happened then? I was assigned to Apollo 11, the first lunar landing flight. It
was preceded by Apollo 7, 8, 9, and 10. 7 was a flight in earth orbit to prove

07:16.920 --> 07:30.720
that the command module was airworthy. 8 took the command module all the way to
the moon. 9 was back in earth orbit and introduced the lunar module along with

07:30.720 --> 07:43.580
the command module. 10 then took the lunar and command modules to the moon in a
dress rehearsal. And then 11 was the first lunar landing flight. So you can see

07:43.580 --> 07:55.840
we moved fairly quickly. Once we got into Apollo, we didn't waste much time in
landing. We just had four preliminary flights and we could not have moved that

07:55.840 --> 08:12.420
rapidly had we not built up a strong foundation of experience on the Gemini
program. Apollo 11 was a very exciting flight. It was, although it was followed

08:12.420 --> 08:22.500
by a number of other flights in many of our minds, it was sort of the
culmination or the apex or the apogee of the Apollo program because President

08:22.500 --> 08:37.200
Kennedy had said that before the end of the decade, we were to land a man on the
moon and return him safely to earth. And on Apollo 11, we did that even double.

08:37.340 --> 08:49.140
We landed two men on the moon and returned them safely to earth. So we felt that
we were fulfilling the presidential mandate and there was great attention and

08:49.140 --> 09:03.400
pressure brought to bear on us as the crew of Apollo 11. What was the historical
value of Apollo 11? One effect, I think, of the first lunar landing was to bring

09:03.400 --> 09:19.180
people of all nations closer together. For example, after the flight of Apollo
11, we three crew members took a very quick trip around the world. We visited,

09:19.580 --> 09:33.900
if I recall correctly, some 22 countries in slightly over a month's time. And we
noticed that everywhere we went, no matter what the country, no matter what its

09:33.900 --> 09:45.180
politics, the people there seemed to identify very closely with us and with the
Apollo program. They felt indeed a part of it. They felt part of humankind's

09:45.180 --> 09:56.520
first step out onto the surface of another planet. And I think that flight of
Apollo 11 did make the world a little bit smaller and a little bit friendlier

09:56.520 --> 10:08.940
and did give it a feeling of unity that had not existed before. Do you think it
was worthwhile going to the moon? Yes, I definitely think going to the moon was

10:08.940 --> 10:24.260
worth it. It's difficult to put numbers on things. The Apollo program costs
around $24 billion, which is a huge amount of money. There have been studies run

10:24.260 --> 10:36.540
which suggest that for every dollar you spend in the space program, there is a
fallout or a spin-off of several dollars of beneficial effects throughout our

10:36.540 --> 10:54.780
economy. People trace miniaturization, advances in electronics, the use of
exotic new materials, and a host of allied advances to the space program. I feel

10:54.780 --> 11:05.760
that the space program is paying for itself, and I feel that the lunar landing
was especially useful because I feel, I believe, that eventually we're going to

11:05.760 --> 11:15.600
leave this planet and we're going to go out through the universe, and we're
going to have, in the long run, a choice of either living here or living

11:15.600 --> 11:28.820
somewhere else. And if you believe that, then you have to get started on that
venture somewhere along the line, and taking that small step from Earth to Moon

11:28.820 --> 11:44.800
is a necessary part of that to be followed by a little bit longer step to Mars
and then perhaps to Titan, one of the satellites of Saturn, and on we go from

11:44.800 --> 11:54.540
there. Do you think we ought to go back to the Moon? I think there will be good
reasons for going back to the Moon, and in time astronomers would love to go to

11:54.540 --> 12:08.300
the Moon. If they could get over on the backside of the Moon, they wouldn't have
any interference from all the electromagnetic noise that we make here on Earth,

12:08.300 --> 12:20.980
and any information they received from the stars would be pure, unfiltered
information. and they'd love to put up a transparent dome on the far side of the

12:20.980 --> 12:32.220
Moon and quietly listen to what the universe is trying to tell us. In similar
fashion, people would like to mine the Moon. It's very rich in heavy elements

12:32.220 --> 12:44.980
such as titanium. Others would like to use those lunar materials to create a
miniature planet, a gigantic space station somewhere between the Earth and the

12:44.980 --> 12:57.680
Moon. Personally, if I were designing a program of exploration, I would rather
go learn a little bit more about Mars before I would return to the Moon. In

12:57.680 --> 13:07.760
fact, in your book, Carrying the Fire, you mentioned something about hoping man
would visit Mars in your lifetime, and you call that magic. So you still feel

13:07.760 --> 13:21.920
that way? Personally, I think there's a lot more to be learned by human beings
prowling around the surface of Mars. One Viking landing is like aliens

13:21.920 --> 13:32.120
sending one probe to Earth, and it lands in the middle of the Mojave Desert, and
therefore those people think they know all there is to know about Earth. They

13:32.120 --> 13:42.900
think it's homogeneously like the Mojave Desert. So I think there's a lot to be
learned by prowling around other regions on Mars and developing the capability

13:42.900 --> 13:59.620
for people to fly off on a long voyage. Mars would be about close to a two-year
trip. It's a, you know, that's right. It's about nine months minimum one way,

13:59.640 --> 14:06.920
and then if you want to spend any time there, the first thing you know is you've
almost used up two years. I've always thought I wanted to go to Mars. From the

14:06.920 --> 14:13.820
time I was a little kid, I wanted to go to Mars. I was never that interested in
the Moon, but I always wanted to go to Mars. And then you ended up going to the

14:13.820 --> 14:24.320
Moon instead. Yes, I got the wrong planet. Ended up with the Moon instead of
Mars. What do you think of the progress made in the space program today? Do you

14:24.320 --> 14:33.100
think we're going in the right direction? I think the shuttle is a wonderful
machine. The design of the shuttle is an excellent one, and it's performing

14:33.100 --> 14:48.340
magnificently, and I think it leads logically into a permanent station in Earth
orbit. So you are in favor of building the manned space station? Oh, yes, yes. I

14:48.340 --> 15:02.660
think it's a necessary step, and I think it's one that will probably pay its own
way. We're already discovering that there are certain advantages to

15:02.660 --> 15:15.960
weightlessness. We can purify pharmaceutical products. We can manufacture
perfect spheres of different materials, and already we're discovering practical

15:15.960 --> 15:26.920
ways of using weightlessness. And I think when we get a station that's able to
stay up in Earth orbit indefinitely, that those ways will multiply. Let's go

15:26.920 --> 15:36.440
back to Apollo 11. How did you get to the Moon? Could you describe that? When
it's about a quarter of a million miles away, and it takes about three days to

15:36.440 --> 15:49.000
get there, you leave Cape Kennedy and northeastern Florida, and in 10 or 11
minutes you find yourself in orbit around the Earth. You stay in orbit around

15:49.000 --> 15:58.720
the Earth for a couple of hours to make sure that all your equipment is
functioning properly, and then you reignite your rocket engine, and you speed up

15:58.720 --> 16:10.340
to around 25,000 miles an hour, which is the speed required to break the bond of
Earth's gravity. That then puts you on a trajectory which you hope will cause

16:10.340 --> 16:21.620
you barely to miss the Moon, some three days later. And during those three days
you're navigating, you're talking to people back on Earth who have very powerful

16:21.620 --> 16:31.000
radar sets, and you make sure that you're going right down the center line of
that imaginary highway, and if you're not you make some small corrections with

16:31.000 --> 16:44.340
your rocket engine to stay on the proper course. Then when you arrive at the
Moon, you just miss it a little bit. You go right ahead of it by about 60 miles,

16:44.420 --> 16:56.580
and as you skim by it, you ignite your engine again and you slow down so that
the Earth's or the Moon's gravity is now able to capture you, and after a little

16:56.580 --> 17:05.900
correction or two, you find yourself in a circular orbit about 60 miles above
the surface of the Moon. You spend a day there and make sure everything is

17:05.900 --> 17:16.780
working right, and then the lunar module separates from the command module, and
the lunar module with two people on board, in this case Neil Armstrong and Buzz

17:16.780 --> 17:32.220
Aldrin, descend rather leisurely and break to a halt and land while you whiz by
overhead. Then they proceed to explore the surface of the Moon for a couple of

17:32.220 --> 17:47.140
hours, get a little sleep, come on back, launch from the Moon, and find you as
you go by overhead. Once the two of you are docked, the lunar module is

17:47.140 --> 18:00.060
jettisoned and allowed to remain in orbit, and then you use the command module
engine to break the bond of lunar gravity, and again get yourself on a

18:00.060 --> 18:14.040
trajectory which will cause you to head back to Earth, and to just barely graze
the atmosphere of the Earth, come coasting in at a shallow angle, and get

18:14.040 --> 18:27.620
captured by Earth's gravity, and as the friction of hitting the atmosphere
increases, the spacecraft slows down, and eventually you open your parachutes

18:27.620 --> 18:38.620
and plop into the ocean some eight days after you began, and that's how you go
to the Moon, and that's what we did on Apollo 11. What were your feelings when

18:38.620 --> 18:47.060
Armstrong was making that first step on the Moon, and what were you thinking
about when you were there all alone in the command module with the Moon between

18:47.060 --> 19:00.580
you and everybody else? My concerns were really not for me and what was going on
inside the command module, but I was concerned about what might happen to

19:00.580 --> 19:17.440
Armstrong and Aldrin on the surface of the Moon, and then even more than that, I
was concerned about their ability to come back up in rendezvous and find me. The

19:17.440 --> 19:32.280
rendezvous procedure is a fairly complicated one when everything is working
exactly right, and if things start breaking, if the radar doesn't work properly

19:32.280 --> 19:41.560
or something else happens, if they get off late, there are a number of
variations on the theme which then ensue, and these can be extraordinarily

19:41.560 --> 19:54.360
complicated. So I was mostly concerned about rendezvous. When I heard that they
were out on the surface, that made me really feel good. I had a feeling of

19:54.360 --> 20:04.780
shared pride, just as the people here on Earth did, that everything seemed to be
going very successfully, but I still in the back of my mind had a nagging fear

20:04.780 --> 20:16.020
about the rendezvous and the docking. As far as my being alone, as I said
before, I rather enjoyed that, and I didn't have any concerns about that. It was

20:16.020 --> 20:27.640
a fun feeling to be over on the backside of the Moon all by myself, knowing I
was the only human in that part of the universe. Over on the other side there

20:27.640 --> 20:38.540
were three billion plus two, three billion on that funny little blue blob that I
could see when I swung around onto the front side, and then two down below me.

20:38.640 --> 20:47.360
But when I was over on the rear of the Moon, I had the whole universe to myself,
and I rather enjoyed that feeling. This concludes our interview for today with

20:47.360 --> 20:50.600
Michael Collins, Command Module Pilot on Apollo 11.
