00:08.980 --> 00:13.060
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.260
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.700
And here are your hosts.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.840
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.520
Philip Jose Farmer has been a mainstay science fiction writer since 1952.

00:53.040 --> 00:58.000
He has written over 40 novels and over 80 short stories focusing on a wide variety of subjects.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.700
These range from Tarzan to the afterlife, from sex-crazed aliens to a star-faring Catholic priest.

01:05.060 --> 01:10.940
Farmer's most famous works are the Riverworld series, the World of Tears series, his erotic fantasy novels,

01:11.400 --> 01:16.200
and the story, later a novel, The Lovers. We asked Farmer how he started writing science fiction.

01:16.840 --> 01:22.360
I started reading science fiction when I was 7 years old. I'm 63 now.

01:24.780 --> 01:30.360
And I knew I always wanted to be a writer, although I didn't do much about it for many years.

01:31.820 --> 01:40.980
The funny thing is I actually intended to become a mainstream writer, that is, to write stories which are not in particular genre.

01:42.080 --> 01:49.660
But I somehow or other just drifted into science fiction and sold my first science fiction story in 1952.

01:50.600 --> 01:57.700
That was called The Lovers. It was a novel-let which was published in a magazine,

01:57.900 --> 02:05.620
and it's generally credited with breaking the taboo against the mature use of sex in science fiction magazine.

02:07.340 --> 02:11.440
We asked Farmer if he consciously set out to break taboos by writing The Lovers.

02:12.900 --> 02:18.540
No, I had an idea for a story and I couldn't write it unless I broke the taboo.

02:18.720 --> 02:25.520
I didn't really consciously set out to do it because I had the idea and I thought it was terrific.

02:25.840 --> 02:29.980
On the other hand, I knew I was going to have a lot of trouble getting as accepted as I did.

02:30.980 --> 02:31.900
I did have a lot of trouble.

02:34.440 --> 02:39.020
The first editor I sent it to, John Campbell, who was the editor of The Stounding,

02:40.820 --> 02:45.360
was the most prestigious and highest paying market, so naturally I sent it to him first.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.200
He returned it with a comment that in a nausea editing.

02:51.040 --> 02:59.820
So I sent it to Horace Gold who was editing Galaxy, which was equally prestigious and had about the same rate rates.

02:59.820 --> 03:03.820
His comments were something like John Campbell's.

03:04.560 --> 03:11.300
Then I sent it to Samuel Mayans who was editor of a magazine called Starling Stories.

03:13.660 --> 03:18.600
He immediately accepted it and knew it was a revolutionary breakthrough.

03:19.580 --> 03:22.600
He published it and I was on my way.

03:22.600 --> 03:33.380
I accepted the next story I wrote was also equally revolutionary and it took me a year before I could get anybody to accept it.

03:35.560 --> 03:40.200
Farmer is also interested in religion and its varied forms and has used it in his works.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.920
My interest in religion has manifested itself throughout all my work.

03:46.920 --> 03:52.160
Although a lot of people when they say the name Farmer, they think of sex in both.

03:53.100 --> 03:57.060
Fact is I've written much more about religion than about sex.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.940
Or sometimes both at the same time.

04:02.020 --> 04:07.820
Something in some respects, sex and religion are two sides of the same coin.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.280
In certain fields of activity.

04:17.940 --> 04:20.220
But religion is only one of many themes.

04:20.780 --> 04:26.980
Farmer feels that he may have labored in relative anonymity for years because his writings are so varied, but he has his reasons.

04:27.720 --> 04:40.520
One of the reasons I've had trouble in the early days I think really becoming identified and getting a ban on the fallers is that I didn't beat on just one or two drums.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.360
I ranged all over the field.

04:43.940 --> 04:53.680
But I find out that if I do a variety of stuff and I don't get tired, each new novel is a new challenge.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.900
I'm not just working the same old theme again.

04:56.980 --> 05:00.080
Tomorrow we continue with more on Philip Jose Farmer.

05:07.520 --> 05:16.340
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:58.380 --> 05:59.680
The show is about the science fiction genre.

05:59.680 --> 05:59.960
The story is about the science fiction genre.

06:01.160 --> 06:05.360
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:20.600 --> 06:25.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:26.860 --> 06:30.380
And here are your hosts.

06:35.340 --> 06:37.680
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.480
We're continuing our interview with Philip Jose Farmer.

06:40.920 --> 06:45.300
We want to explore here some background related to one of Farmer's major themes, religion.

06:46.060 --> 06:51.820
As Farmer allowed earlier, he considers himself a writer of religious themes even more so than a writer of sexual themes.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.460
His own religious background is quite checkered.

06:54.460 --> 07:01.400
I was sent to Sunday School when I was very little and I came interested in the Bible and I read it on my own.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.280
And I even read the Book of Mormon, which was about nine years old.

07:06.620 --> 07:18.060
And I always wrestled all my life with the problems of immortality, predestination, grace, gastro-life and all that sort of stuff.

07:18.060 --> 07:26.240
I was raised as a Christian scientist up until the time I was about twelve.

07:27.520 --> 07:39.640
And then I was sent to a Presbyterian church where there was a conflict between Christian science and the Presbyterian idea of predestination.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.960
And then when I was about sixteen, I guess I became an atheist.

07:45.440 --> 07:53.360
Now I've gone through atheism through agnosticism and now I was converted to the disciples of Christ.

07:54.800 --> 08:01.700
And then I backslid, fell from grace, as the theological term goes.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.420
And then I lapsed back into agnosticism.

08:05.420 --> 08:08.080
And what are farmers present beliefs?

08:08.940 --> 08:14.960
My present situation is that without immortality life has no meaning.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.620
If there's a creation there must be a creator.

08:19.540 --> 08:26.920
But I've come tremendously interested in what to sometimes refer to as myth.

08:26.920 --> 08:34.400
It isn't really like the Muslims, the Muslims Sufism school.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.720
Then a lot of related stuff like that.

08:41.800 --> 08:48.080
Like here right now I'm in a sort of a limbo heading towards something I don't know what.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.160
The concept of an afterlife appears repeatedly in farmers' works.

08:52.160 --> 08:59.000
Well, if you think about it, there could be a million different possibilities in a natural life, in their work.

08:59.980 --> 09:10.980
But one of my perhaps unstated themes is that immortality may not depend upon a supernatural being.

09:13.100 --> 09:19.480
It's in the evolutionary drive of man for him to invent immortality himself.

09:19.480 --> 09:26.740
Well, the drawback to that is those people who are already dead will remain dead, right?

09:27.120 --> 09:37.780
That doesn't correspond to the religious idea of immortality where everybody is raised from the first human being to the last one.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.540
I like to do a lot of variations on that.

09:41.880 --> 09:46.020
I have a new book called The Unraising Mask.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.840
That's the quotation from the book.

09:48.800 --> 09:56.800
This is concerned with theology, afterlife, immortality.

09:58.040 --> 10:01.660
You might call it a philosophical theological space opera.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.480
Many of farmers' first works had the central theme of religion.

10:22.080 --> 10:27.840
The lovers and a woman a day deal with a future amalgamation of church and state called the Sturge.

10:28.040 --> 10:34.100
A popular character, Father John Carmody, is a planet-hopping Catholic priest who has appeared in several short stories.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.800
We learn about his former life and conversion in the excellent novel Night of Light.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.020
Inside Outside is a wild tale about the afterlife and immortality.

10:43.820 --> 10:48.940
It is in fact the predecessor to the famous River World series, which we will discuss in our next show.

11:08.800 --> 11:38.780
The Unraising Mask

11:50.660 --> 11:54.660
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio show, so stay with us.

12:10.280 --> 12:15.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.920
And here are your hosts.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.960
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.300
Having looked into Philip Hosey's farmer's feelings on religion and immortality,

12:31.660 --> 12:33.760
we began a look today at the River World series.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
Farmer explains the basis of the story.

12:37.280 --> 12:44.160
It concerns a planet in which there's a 10 million mile long river which follows the valley.

12:44.920 --> 12:55.320
And everybody has lived from about 150,000 B.C. to about 1983 A.D. was resurrected along the banks of the river

12:56.500 --> 12:59.260
and rejuvenated for them, looked like they were 25.

12:59.260 --> 13:08.360
And the main mystery behind the whole thing was why were all these people resurrected?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.340
Who did it and how?

13:13.400 --> 13:19.940
But the River World concept is so big that farmers managed only to scratch the surface in the four main novels of the series.

13:20.900 --> 13:26.620
There are so many themes that I wanted to explore during the course of those four novels,

13:26.620 --> 13:32.040
but I couldn't do it because I would have slowed the story down too much.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.740
It wasn't taking too many sidetracks, you might say.

13:35.860 --> 13:39.340
I'd still be working on that particular series.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.560
What else is left? Listen to farmer as he gives us an inkling of what he would like to cover.

13:45.680 --> 13:53.540
I didn't go into any detail on how you could work out viable societies with people from every place and every time.

13:53.540 --> 14:04.200
I also wanted to bring up in depth what would happen to famous people on that planet.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.080
Well, there's Carl Marx, for instance.

14:09.500 --> 14:16.540
What would he think of what happened to his ideas about communism on the planet Earth after he died?

14:18.780 --> 14:29.860
Leonardo da Vinci, his ideas about art, plus the fact that he's on a planet where there are very few pigments available, for instance, for him to paint.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.860
What would he do there?

14:34.540 --> 14:46.560
I also wanted to bring up various figures from science and the military, philosophy and so forth, and show what they would do there.

14:47.160 --> 14:59.560
Now, one of the things about the River World was that although you were resurrected there in a useful body of your own, as it was in 25, or earlier, if you died in 1425,

15:01.820 --> 15:09.800
if you're just, for instance, you were 83 when you were dying, and your mind is still 83 and you have 83 years of experience on Earth behind you.

15:12.220 --> 15:22.580
Now, is your character formed? Are you going to go through perhaps a thousand years being the same person, or are you going to improve?

15:23.100 --> 15:26.260
And is the magic labyrinth the last word on the River World?

15:26.260 --> 15:36.880
I made a lot of people mad at me. Because of that last sentence or paragraph I should say I wrote on the magic labyrinth.

15:37.220 --> 15:42.180
Everything seems to have been settled. Everything has been cleared up.

15:42.180 --> 15:58.060
And then one of the characters, the kind of minor one, Peter J. Strigat, he's celebrating with the others in the misty tar when he thinks he hears a football outside in the hallway.

15:59.360 --> 16:05.280
He goes out, comes back, says to the others, I didn't see anyone. It must have been my imagination.

16:06.060 --> 16:09.200
A lot of readers got mad at me because they thought, oh no, he's going to write another one.

16:10.020 --> 16:15.760
He's leaving a loophole. Well, I am leaving a loophole. And I don't know whether I'll go through it or not.

16:16.280 --> 16:33.100
But it's quite possible that the magic labyrinth wasn't the final one in that series before that everything that our protagonist learns and everything that everybody else learns is completely untrue.

16:34.780 --> 16:42.360
So the River World novels may or may not be finished, but we do have some more side stream stories to anticipate. More on Farmer tomorrow.

16:49.900 --> 16:58.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:03.100 --> 17:33.080
The story of the Fiction Fiction is a story about a man who was born in the middle of the world and who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who

17:40.200 --> 17:43.020
was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man who was a man him

17:43.020 --> 17:47.700
coming up next is the science fiction radio show so stay with us

18:03.380 --> 18:08.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.040
And here are your hosts.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.300
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.980
Our show today continues the discussion with Philip Jose Farmer.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.940
A major incident in Farmer's career began when Venus on the Half Shell,

18:27.940 --> 18:30.380
a novel written under the pseudonym Kilgore Trout,

18:30.760 --> 18:35.000
appeared in the pages of fantasy and science fiction in late 74, early 75.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.600
Of course, Kilgore Trout is the creation of author Kurt Vonnegut Jr.

18:39.220 --> 18:42.680
The character Trout is an impoverished, underappreciated science fiction writer

18:42.680 --> 18:44.820
who appears in a number of Vonnegut's novels.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.860
We asked Farmer if he identifies with Kilgore Trout.

18:48.900 --> 18:54.420
I was a fan of Vonnegut. I like all those books, but Kilgore Trout really turned me on

18:54.420 --> 18:59.240
because his early experiences, as a matter of fact his later ones,

18:59.460 --> 19:02.660
were like a lot of my early experiences.

19:03.020 --> 19:09.400
A lot of the experiences, like the other science fiction writers back in the old days

19:09.400 --> 19:13.560
weren't being paid much, and science fiction would look down upon.

19:14.600 --> 19:20.320
And we were being taken due to our inexperience with various publishers and agents.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.680
Also, I had a tough time getting any recognition.

19:26.420 --> 19:30.720
I guess that's why I identified with him. Plus, in fact, he's a great character.

19:32.420 --> 19:37.140
Vonnegut did not appreciate the reviews given Venus on the Half Shell, either pro or con,

19:37.340 --> 19:40.840
because most of the reviewers approached the work as if Vonnegut were the author.

19:41.460 --> 19:45.620
This cost Farmer the opportunity to write another novel under the Kilgore Trout pseudonym.

19:45.620 --> 19:54.860
I don't know what is the reaction to this art of the novel itself, but so many people thought that he'd written it.

19:55.060 --> 19:58.000
He was deluged, hundreds of maybe thousands of places.

19:59.340 --> 20:00.780
Then the reviews came out.

20:01.640 --> 20:07.540
Some said Venus on the Half Shell by Kilgore Trout was the worst thing he'd written,

20:07.660 --> 20:09.620
and others said it was the best thing he'd ever written.

20:11.400 --> 20:16.480
When I applied for permission to write The Sun of Jimmy Valentine, which I really would have loved,

20:17.140 --> 20:18.760
I could have had a lot of fun with it.

20:19.980 --> 20:23.380
He said no, which is his prerogative.

20:24.840 --> 20:29.100
We asked if The Sun of Jimmy Valentine was Kilgore Trout's one erotic novel.

20:30.700 --> 20:35.800
It was not only his one and only specifically erotic book.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.720
It was also his only non-fictional book.

20:39.900 --> 20:45.900
Farmer obviously enjoys writing about fictional authors who in turn write about their own fictional authors, and so on.

20:46.320 --> 20:49.260
Listen as he describes what writing as Kilgore Trout started.

20:50.140 --> 20:58.780
In the Venus on the Half Shell, the protagonist, Simon Lagstaff, had his favorite science fiction author.

20:59.660 --> 21:09.300
Just as in the Vonnegut book, the Elliott Rose Waterbust of Kilgore Trout was the greatest living writer in any field.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.920
He should have been President of the U.S. and couldn't have solved all the problems.

21:12.760 --> 21:23.200
Anyway, in Venus on the Half Shell, Simon Lagstaff liked to read the science fiction works of a fellow called Jonathan Swiss Somers the Third.

21:23.200 --> 21:29.340
And I describe his various works as an out-vitam and give the titles.

21:30.620 --> 21:44.560
But Jonathan Swiss Somers, who is a fictional author, wrote about a giant German shepherd police dog whose IQ had been raised to about 200 in a laboratory and he became a private detective.

21:45.660 --> 21:56.080
Now, I plan eventually on writing a book by Ralph von Baubau, this dog, under the name Ralph von Baubau.

21:57.820 --> 22:10.100
And then maybe I'll end the cycle by having Ralph von Baubau write about a human named vonnegut or something like that and completing it, going right back to Vonnegut again.

22:11.260 --> 22:19.420
Farmer conceded with the extended family group called the Vold Newton family in which many great historical and fictional characters are descended from the scarlet Pimpernel.

22:19.980 --> 22:26.080
Thus Kilgore Trout is related to Sherlock Holmes, Doc Savage, Sam Spade and James Bond, among others.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.680
We will look into this aspect of Farmer's writing some more tomorrow.

22:36.480 --> 22:45.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:28.840 --> 23:29.660
The show is a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with a series of episodes with

Greetings and welcome.

23:59.580 --> 23:59.640
Nothing to lose at all?

23:59.640 --> 24:01.420
And here are your hosts.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.640
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

24:09.200 --> 24:12.060
This show will conclude our interview with Philip Jose Farmer.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.720
Yesterday we discussed Farmer's pension for riding under pseudonyms.

24:16.020 --> 24:19.100
As it turns out this practice has a very desirable side effect.

24:20.280 --> 24:25.600
One of the funny things about this is that I found out that I could use the

24:26.180 --> 24:29.020
fictional author device to break a writing block.

24:29.360 --> 24:35.520
I had a writing block once, so that terrible thing that sometimes happens to writers.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.560
They don't know what's caused this for some reason.

24:40.240 --> 24:44.980
They might have many ideas, be eager to go, but when they sit down in front of a typewriter nothing happens.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.720
Well, that happened to me once.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.420
I never thought it would. I thought I was immune to such things.

24:52.420 --> 24:53.560
It was dead.

24:54.400 --> 24:59.120
And after wrestling for two months and getting no place, I had an idea.

25:00.800 --> 25:10.720
I sat down at the typewriter and wrote a story, not by Philip Jose Farmer, but by David Copperfield, I'd say.

25:11.660 --> 25:13.480
I don't remember which particular nom to call it.

25:15.760 --> 25:21.580
The story poured out. Very good. I thought so anyway.

25:23.100 --> 25:26.120
When I'd completed that, the writing block was gone.

25:26.640 --> 25:32.280
See, I wasn't writing then as me, Philip Jose Farmer, but as I say, Gilbert Trout.

25:33.580 --> 25:36.100
And I was in his shoes. I had no trouble.

25:36.100 --> 25:44.380
The funny thing about this is it's a psychological trick that I'm conscious of.

25:47.320 --> 25:48.320
And yet it works.

25:50.180 --> 25:54.560
It's not like I'm trying to trick my unconscious, but I must be doing it somewhere.

25:57.900 --> 26:03.900
I don't know of anybody else who's ever broken a writer's block in that manner, but I recommend trying it.

26:05.220 --> 26:09.900
Farmer has also written several books featuring Tarzan or Tarzan-like characters.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.540
Tarzan Alive is Tarzan's biography.

26:13.200 --> 26:18.400
The erotic novel A Feast Unknown and its clean sequels The Mad Goblin and Lord of the Trees

26:18.400 --> 26:21.840
feature thinly veiled versions of Tarzan and Doc Savage.

26:22.360 --> 26:28.500
Lord Tiger, the Opar books, and the Adventures of the Peerless Peer also have Tarzan-like protagonists.

26:28.980 --> 26:31.720
We asked Farmer when he developed his interest in Tarzan.

26:32.580 --> 26:36.240
I first read Tarzan when I guess I was about seven or eight years old.

26:36.420 --> 26:42.460
I became wrapped up in that early age with the words of, let your eyes swirl.

26:45.540 --> 26:50.720
But when I started college, I kind of lost interest in reading anymore.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.820
But later Farmer picked up on Tarzan again.

26:59.380 --> 27:01.260
This time he saw Tarzan in a different light.

27:02.420 --> 27:20.700
When I started reading the books about Tarzan again, and this time, although I still kept a lot of my childhood interest in him,

27:20.700 --> 27:21.900
I had not seen before.

27:23.380 --> 27:33.000
He was not just a child who'd been cast away and raised by great apes and then become a creature of the jungle,

27:33.500 --> 27:45.020
then returned to playing the torch, and he was sort of an archetype of many, many heroes from classical myth.

27:45.940 --> 27:50.940
And now I'm sure that when Burroughs wrote this, he didn't know what he was doing, but he did it unconsciously.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.520
I think the creation of Tarzan was just a genius.

27:55.600 --> 28:03.020
Burroughs is not a great writer, but he has a great character just like Akelin and Doyle is not a great writer,

28:03.180 --> 28:06.920
but he created a great character, Sherlock Holmes.

28:07.920 --> 28:15.840
Philip Jose Farmer, an author with a seemingly endless supply of unique ideas who appears just now to be gaining widespread acceptance.

28:23.360 --> 28:28.920
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:28.920 --> 28:32.120
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:36.920 --> 29:05.020
The show is a production of the science fiction series,
