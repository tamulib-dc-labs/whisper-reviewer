The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today, presented by the

00:18.260 --> 00:20.500
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.860 --> 00:27.040
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.420 --> 00:35.400
This edition of the Science Fiction Radio Show will be an interview with author Joe Haldeman.

00:36.840 --> 00:41.920
Joe Haldeman began publishing science fiction in the early 1970s and has already gained the highest

00:41.920 --> 00:47.800
acclaimed field offers to its authors. His first novel of the forever war, which came out in 1975,

00:48.440 --> 00:53.800
won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for that year. Since then, he's published two novels,

00:54.380 --> 00:58.020
Mindbridge and All My Sins Remembered, and a collection of short stories.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.500
Haldeman is noted for the strong scientific backgrounds in his work,

01:02.920 --> 01:05.500
but also for his sensitive treatment of human character.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.180
Your writing started out as a hobby that developed into a profession, didn't it?

01:25.020 --> 01:30.800
Well, yeah, although the development is fairly rampant, I always wrote ever since I was

01:30.800 --> 01:37.820
oh, in second or third grade. I wrote a lot of poetry. And well, when I was

01:38.980 --> 01:44.760
senior in college, my last semester, I took a creative writing course. I was in physics and

01:44.760 --> 01:51.340
astronomy, but I wanted to take something easy to fill out my 18 hours or so. And I wrote two

01:51.340 --> 01:58.660
science fiction stories. And eventually I sold both of them. I was drafted. And then when I came

01:58.660 --> 02:03.140
back from Vietnam, they gave you 30 days leave. And I just re-typed the stories then and sent

02:03.140 --> 02:09.280
them out. And one of them sold before I was out of the army. Then I don't know, I just,

02:10.280 --> 02:15.500
I never thought you could make very much money at it. But I sort of saw the source of beer money.

02:18.140 --> 02:24.560
And when I decided to drop out of graduate school and try a semester of writing full time,

02:24.680 --> 02:30.280
I sold my first novel about a couple of days after I dropped out. So I never went back.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.880
I tend to kind of cement things.

02:34.400 --> 02:42.540
Yeah. Yeah. So it's funny, coincidence has lots to do with it. There's an awful lot of luck in

02:42.540 --> 02:50.700
not getting started writing. Your first works, I had to do with war. You were in Vietnam and

02:50.700 --> 02:56.380
that must have had a significant impact on you. Oh, yeah. Well, it's, of course, it's the most

02:56.380 --> 03:02.800
dramatic thing that's ever happened to me. So it's the most obvious fuel for my fiction. Although I

03:02.800 --> 03:08.940
don't want to be typed as a writer about war or a half written two novels and edited one anthology

03:08.940 --> 03:16.000
about it. The old adage to write what you know and of the things I know that's one that's most

03:18.060 --> 03:24.020
universally interesting. In Infinite Dreams, which is a collection of stories you published

03:24.620 --> 03:34.100
in various publications since about 1972, war and violence linked with a change in mankind's

03:34.100 --> 03:40.880
behavior seem to be recurrent themes in some of these stories. Are you saying that sometimes

03:40.880 --> 03:48.500
man has to face violent conflicts in order to change his behavior? Well, I don't think I'm coming

03:48.500 --> 03:55.700
out and saying it that directly. I think it's obvious that confronting death on a daily basis

03:56.340 --> 04:03.180
changes people and sometimes radically for the worse. And that people who are totally dehumanized

04:03.180 --> 04:12.200
by war. But speaking racially, I don't think you could make such a broad statement. What's behind

04:12.200 --> 04:17.820
some of the things I'm writing is the hope that human nature eventually may improve to the point

04:17.820 --> 04:27.080
where we won't have wars. Find other ways to settle our differences. Well, actually, being in the

04:27.080 --> 04:35.960
army was an important effect on my writing aside from war, because I met a whole new class of people.

04:36.720 --> 04:45.000
That is all of my friends while I was growing up. It tended to be a white middle class, upper middle

04:45.000 --> 04:52.700
class kids, and they were successors, white middle class, upper class scientists, so forth.

04:53.820 --> 05:00.120
And it was just a mundane revelation to find that people who came from different backgrounds

05:00.120 --> 05:07.020
still had an awful lot in common with me. Most of the guys in my combat outfit were

05:07.020 --> 05:13.700
urban black high school, which were your high school dropouts. Yeah, it got along quite well.

05:14.580 --> 05:22.620
In both your novels, Mindbridge and Forever War, you have mankind united in the face of a crisis

05:22.620 --> 05:28.100
with an alien race. Do you think that we'll ever be able to progress without this sort of conflict

05:28.100 --> 05:35.920
spurring it on? I wonder whether, well, of course, it's a simplification, and it's an old

05:37.160 --> 05:41.820
theme in science fiction. That is everybody getting together because the Martians are after us.

05:43.260 --> 05:47.900
I wish I could say that I thought that we would be able to do this in the face of a less dramatic

05:47.900 --> 05:56.240
uniform enemy, that is obviously the combined threats of overpopulation and dwindling resources

05:56.240 --> 06:03.980
and industrial pollution are as threatening as either of the enemies in those two novels,

06:04.750 --> 06:09.680
but we can't make a coherent face against this enemy and fight it.

06:11.940 --> 06:18.600
It's just a way of making specific sort of a real but diffuse nightmare.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.520
In some of your stories that do deal with war and conflict,

06:23.520 --> 06:33.120
I think that's a story that's been heard on a personal level, where a man is

06:35.900 --> 06:46.940
hit by a laser mine and his leg is cut off and he's hurt personally. Does that relate

06:46.940 --> 06:51.260
to something in your own experiences? Well, I was wounded pretty severely,

06:51.900 --> 06:57.880
I was hospitalized for six months, and it was a boogie trap. I didn't set it off,

06:58.020 --> 07:03.880
somebody else did, but it was a pretty big one. I had over 200 separate wounds,

07:04.980 --> 07:10.260
but managed to come out of it all right after a few months of physical therapy.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.700
So it's, yeah, I draw on that experience. The one you're talking about is the mind of his own,

07:18.660 --> 07:25.400
but I think I've got other short stories like the private war, private jaco, they draw on that memory.

07:26.080 --> 07:32.800
Are you exercising some demons? I don't know whether I am or not. I think I'm just using

07:32.800 --> 07:40.280
available material. I don't think the demon is too easily exercised by fiction.

07:41.380 --> 07:44.540
That's a trueism that I don't think is always true.

07:45.540 --> 07:53.340
In your first novel, Forever War, it's a novel that deals with war on anagolactic or

07:53.340 --> 08:01.520
anagolactic level. Is it similar in some respects to Heinlein's Starship Troopers?

08:03.900 --> 08:08.520
Did you intentionally write it as sort of an answer to that, or has it just come about,

08:08.520 --> 08:15.980
did the work ended up that way? Well, there was no rough intention on my part. In fact, I didn't

08:15.980 --> 08:22.340
realize until I was about 70 or 80 pages into the book that many of the details were similar to

08:22.340 --> 08:28.920
Starship Troopers. Somebody else pointed that out when he read the manuscript. I wasn't doing an

08:28.920 --> 08:34.100
answer to Heinlein's book. I thought Heinlein's book was admirable in many ways, even though we have

08:34.100 --> 08:44.280
diametrically opposed philosophies. But no, it was, if there's any relation to any book,

08:44.440 --> 08:51.700
it is to my own first novel, Warrior, because it's an expansion into a science fiction universe

08:51.700 --> 09:03.600
of notions that I was trying to express in mainstream novel. Also, in Further War, you deal with

09:04.520 --> 09:11.000
time compression on the Starships. They travel off to battle at speeds near to that of light,

09:11.180 --> 09:16.180
and then when they return, hundreds of years have passed on the Earth. That's hard science.

09:17.300 --> 09:22.360
Many writers, if they're considered hard science or soft science, and some mix the two styles

09:22.360 --> 09:28.620
together, what part does hard science play in your writing? Well, I try to use it to make the

09:28.620 --> 09:35.480
worlds that are in an event more believable, at least to me, since I do have a background in science

09:36.600 --> 09:43.100
engineering. I think, well, the writer has to at least suspend his own disbelief while he's

09:43.100 --> 09:48.100
making up these stories, and it's easier for me to do it if it's on a fairly solid scientific

09:48.100 --> 09:54.380
foundation. Even though my science is rather old fashioned and probably rather sloppy, by

09:55.180 --> 10:02.060
real scientists' standards, it's still enough to convince me, so it's fulfilled its function.

10:03.560 --> 10:12.380
The, for instance, it goes deeper than just description, the time dilation in the Forever

10:12.380 --> 10:21.700
War, so it's scientifically accurate. Its main function is metaphorical, and that is to demonstrate

10:21.700 --> 10:26.980
how the soldiers who fight a war become isolated from the culture that they're supposed to be

10:26.980 --> 10:34.780
protecting, using a science-fictional device to exaggerate something that happens to every soldier.

10:37.120 --> 10:42.320
Yeah, and then that, when these soldiers leave and come back, the world they left isn't even the

10:42.320 --> 10:48.220
same world once they get back to it. Which is quite true. I remember when I came back from

10:48.220 --> 10:53.060
Vietnam, I was suddenly plunged into what was an alien culture, even though I'd only been

10:53.060 --> 11:01.900
a soldier for two years. A lot of things had changed, and, you know, it's not a great thing

11:01.900 --> 11:05.500
to come back. There were no victory parades, and that sort of thing.

11:10.720 --> 11:16.380
Yeah, the conflicts aside, Forever War and Mind Bridge have optimistic endings,

11:17.000 --> 11:23.500
but in your novel All My Sends Remembered, was that put together from a series of short stories?

11:24.280 --> 11:28.160
About half of it appeared as two novelettes, you know.

11:28.460 --> 11:35.520
Yeah, but in the end of it, the protagonist is just literally turned off and killed at the end of it.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.700
It's rather pessimistic ending.

11:39.480 --> 11:46.580
Well, it was planned all along that way. The story is about a bureaucracy that

11:46.580 --> 11:51.520
totally takes over a man's identity, and he doesn't really exist except as a tool for that

11:51.520 --> 11:56.100
bureaucracy. When it becomes an efficient tool, he's scrapped.

11:57.980 --> 12:05.060
Yeah, he's programmed to go out and do certain, I guess what you'd call, covert operations.

12:05.060 --> 12:14.300
Yeah, and he goes more or less against his will, that is to say, through very advanced techniques

12:14.300 --> 12:21.520
of conditioning. He's turned into a thoroughly different person. He was a Buddhist, a pacifist

12:21.520 --> 12:28.080
when he started out. He did not get the job he signed up for. They twisted him around into

12:28.680 --> 12:34.420
killing machines. And at the end of it, he rebelled against that?

12:34.680 --> 12:40.820
Yeah, finally. He was no longer suited their purpose and then they got rid of him.

12:42.640 --> 12:47.980
Jumping up to Mindbridge, it's dedicated to your teachers at the Iowa Writers Workshop.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.900
And the style of the novel is unusual. Is there a connection with that?

12:53.640 --> 13:00.780
Oh, not really. The connection is with John Dos Passos, actually. I read the USH

13:00.780 --> 13:06.660
Reliative some years before at Mindbridge and really was impressed by the way it worked and

13:06.660 --> 13:11.980
thought it would work really well in science fiction. So I tried it out in a rather long,

13:11.980 --> 13:19.480
short story to how it used a modest proposal. And it looked like it would work, so I went ahead

13:19.480 --> 13:26.120
and applied it to Mindbridge. I did do most of that book while I was studying at Iowa,

13:26.360 --> 13:35.280
and that's why I did a case. Yeah, you also used a lot of some humor to Howard Hughes'

13:35.400 --> 13:41.180
Amon's proposal. Do you find that a useful tool to get across your message?

13:41.180 --> 13:49.860
Yeah, sarcasm is the operative word. Yeah, I think even in a deadly serious book,

13:50.000 --> 13:57.580
there has to be some leavening of humor. A lot of science fiction is just too somber and full of

13:57.580 --> 14:06.900
message. I think my primary function is to be an entertainer. Humor is part of that.

14:08.080 --> 14:13.580
I also noticed in the dedication, a lot of the authors at the workshop were mainstream authors.

14:14.500 --> 14:20.380
What was their reaction to science fiction? Well, they were a little apprehensive about it.

14:20.540 --> 14:24.120
See, they didn't know I was a science fiction writer when I joined the workshop.

14:24.960 --> 14:32.040
So I joined on the basis of my first novel, which was not science fiction. And some of them were

14:32.040 --> 14:39.860
outwardly hostile towards science fiction, such as Stanley Elkin. Others were anywhere between

14:39.860 --> 14:45.840
apprehensive and slightly sympathetic. Stephen Becker, one of them, had actually had a few pieces

14:45.840 --> 14:54.360
in the magazine Fantasy and Science Fiction. In general, though, they thinly disguised attitude

14:54.360 --> 15:04.400
that this stuff was just commercial fiction and, therefore, beneath contempt. But they couldn't

15:04.400 --> 15:08.800
ignore the fact that I was making more money than most of them were with my science fiction.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.900
And that might have been a cause of tension in some cases.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.780
Yeah, that's a point that's kind of hard to argue with. Yeah.

15:16.860 --> 15:21.960
Yeah, that attitude is one I've never really been able to understand because some of our greatest

15:21.960 --> 15:28.880
novels are science fiction novels. So that's true. But the field is judged by its worst,

15:29.080 --> 15:35.980
not by its best. And people like that think of science fiction, they think in terms of great

15:35.980 --> 15:45.000
D movies and Lazy Television. They've never read much of the best of the field. It's pity.

15:46.400 --> 15:55.080
Back again to Mindbridge. A specific question about it. The alien race that created the Mindbridge,

15:55.320 --> 16:02.320
you suggest they commit racial suicide. Why do you think a supposedly advanced race would do

16:02.320 --> 16:10.920
something like that? I don't know. I was feeling well. They lived for millions or hundreds of

16:10.920 --> 16:16.760
millions or even billions of years, thoroughly, individually immortal. And it just wasn't anything

16:16.760 --> 16:25.440
else that they hadn't done except die. But I just that sort of throw away. There's I didn't put any

16:25.440 --> 16:33.140
deep thought into why they should do that. I just wanted the image of the light from their passing,

16:33.140 --> 16:38.800
fighting up the nights of Earth's fault. Humans were just the end of thought.

16:39.840 --> 16:46.180
Yeah, they supernovaed their star. Yeah. The sickness loop

16:48.200 --> 16:54.960
remains of their civilization. In tricentennial, when the starship returns to Earth,

16:55.760 --> 17:00.900
all of the humans are gone. It never returns, actually. It doesn't return. Okay. It's a

17:01.280 --> 17:07.780
shift in viewpoint. Oh, okay. What happened to the humans on the Earth? Some sort of a war.

17:09.040 --> 17:15.300
Okay. The it doesn't say anything except that there's no life left on Earth. And

17:15.860 --> 17:18.880
it looks pretty much like an ecological zero.

17:24.820 --> 17:29.900
And my other question about tricentennial is who were the beings in the glass and metal tubes?

17:30.900 --> 17:37.440
Well, those are the leftovers, the people who were on the L5 type colony. They're still there.

17:37.760 --> 17:43.860
Their society is a closed cycle agriculture society. And there's no reason that they would

17:43.860 --> 17:52.060
have to die when the Earth died. In various novels and stories that you've written, you've

17:52.060 --> 17:58.000
created some excellent aliens. How do you go about constructing your aliens? Not very logically. I

17:58.560 --> 18:06.160
haven't answered that before. And it's a hard thing to answer. I know, for instance, the LeVri in

18:07.020 --> 18:14.480
Mindbridge. I did have this notion of aliens who were shape changers who appeared as

18:14.480 --> 18:22.640
angelically beautiful creatures, but were ferocious killers, mindless killers. I wanted that image.

18:23.920 --> 18:29.460
But normally, I don't know the the Sik-Kang and all my sense of

18:29.460 --> 18:33.760
remembrance, I just thought I'd make a big bug that had a Jewish sense of humor.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.500
So that's all I just, everything else is decoration.

18:39.500 --> 18:44.500
You sort of close your eyes and see this critter and type it down.

18:46.820 --> 18:56.940
I have on occasion looked through books of animal anatomy and just glanced through biology and

18:56.940 --> 19:05.400
botany text books to try to be inspired by natural forms. But I don't have any algorithm that I

19:05.400 --> 19:13.480
know works for making monsters. In Mindbridge and Forever War, humanity has greatly changed at the

19:13.480 --> 19:21.060
end of both of the books, almost an evolutionary difference. Do you believe that we will radically

19:21.060 --> 19:27.120
have radically different natures in the future? I think it's quite possible, even say within the

19:27.120 --> 19:33.280
span of a century, so many of the things that determine human nature are things that can be

19:33.280 --> 19:45.540
mitigated by technology, such as the problem of dying so soon. That is, it's possible that we'll,

19:46.360 --> 19:52.020
in a couple of generations, be able to live a century, two centuries, maybe a thousand years,

19:52.180 --> 19:57.780
maybe as long as we care to. That'll radically change human nature because it will take the pressure

19:57.780 --> 20:09.280
off of individuals. There are other less so sanguine notions. It's possible that the sciences of

20:09.280 --> 20:18.720
communication will grow into a kind of sophisticated mind control, where it will be difficult for the

20:18.720 --> 20:23.420
individual to know exactly what is his idea and what has been induced by his own society.

20:24.200 --> 20:31.600
A sort of a sophisticated life-long brainwashing doesn't seem too unlikely, if you can argue that

20:31.600 --> 20:42.020
it's happening now. Similar to what Corn Lutheran Poel did in Space Merchants. Right. Space Merchants is

20:43.580 --> 20:52.680
chillingly prophetic novel, actually. They do love things with their heads. Those of us who

20:52.680 --> 21:00.260
stay away from the TV screen aren't as affected by others, but it is there. The novels and short

21:00.260 --> 21:06.660
stories that you've written, which one did you enjoy writing the most? I don't know, let me see.

21:08.760 --> 21:19.180
Strangely enough, I think I enjoyed most writing a pseudonymous adventure novel called Antares

21:19.180 --> 21:28.840
within, because it was so easy. Most of my writing was very difficult to do. And this is just setting

21:28.840 --> 21:34.800
a spy up and letting him knock the bad guys down and win in the end. It's all very pleasant.

21:35.860 --> 21:43.460
In terms of more serious work, I think Mindbridge was the most fun to write. I had the most latitude

21:43.460 --> 21:52.940
there. I also enjoyed that the most until this latest one. Yeah, I read Atar the Merman. Oh,

21:53.200 --> 21:59.720
God, I guess it was a couple of years back. When did you write that? Oh, I guess about 71.

22:01.320 --> 22:09.080
But that appeared to be the beginning of a series. Yes, that's right. The ideal was that

22:09.080 --> 22:14.400
I was going to write three or four, and then somebody else was going to pick it up. That's why

22:14.920 --> 22:22.280
it's not under my name. It's what they call a house name. And I got tired of the damn thing

22:22.280 --> 22:28.560
after two. I did write a third one and got paid for it, but it's pretty lousy and they

22:28.560 --> 22:36.240
didn't print it. And then the whole series just fizzled away. I guess they were working on a

22:38.340 --> 22:43.720
contemporary enthusiasm over dolphins. And when that started evaporating, they

22:44.230 --> 22:50.160
put the kibosh on the series. Or maybe they couldn't find anybody to continue it.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.420
Yeah, I would imagine writing a series book like that would be difficult.

22:56.120 --> 23:03.580
Well, the first one's easy. And in the case of Atar, the second one was pretty easy, too.

23:03.580 --> 23:13.320
But I've also done two Star Trek novels, which are sort of series things. It gets old real fast.

23:14.520 --> 23:20.360
You can't make up things. You have to be consistent with the canon that you've already established.

23:21.400 --> 23:26.820
And that can get real boring after about 100,000 orders. Terrific.

23:26.820 --> 23:34.820
Yeah, and the Star Trek material that you've written, the framework is already built and

23:34.820 --> 23:39.320
you have to build a story around the framework. Yeah, it's already established. That was sort

23:39.320 --> 23:46.000
of cute, though, writing the first one. I had fun because I'd been in the service during most of

23:46.000 --> 23:52.660
Star Trek. And so I had to treat it as a research project. And I would solve the TV show every

23:52.660 --> 23:58.760
afternoon. And then I read all the books and make charts and things like that and sat down and wrote

23:58.760 --> 24:07.100
the books. That was an odd thing. I had to sign a two-bub contract. Whereas I found the first one

24:07.100 --> 24:14.400
very interesting and fun to write. The second one was quite difficult to write. And the first one

24:14.400 --> 24:19.500
took three months and the second took nine. How did you get approached to write those?

24:20.400 --> 24:25.820
Well, it was just being in the right place the right time. In a way, Jim Blish was doing the

24:26.420 --> 24:30.140
series of these things. And I knew they were quite financially successful.

24:32.440 --> 24:38.980
And when Jim died, I was in correspondence with Fred Pole, who was his editor there.

24:40.040 --> 24:47.260
And I just apologized for being like a vulture circling over the corpse. But I asked whether

24:47.260 --> 24:54.760
anybody was picking up Jim's work and he said, why don't you give it a try? And actually, well,

24:54.840 --> 25:00.900
Jim was taking the scripts from the TV show and just turning them into short stories. Whereas he

25:00.900 --> 25:06.940
wanted me to do what Jim would have done if he had lived, which was write original novels around

25:06.940 --> 25:15.360
the Star Trek characters. One of them, the novels was a Planet of Judgment. Let's see. I read one

25:15.360 --> 25:20.700
of them. And that was one I had to do where they discovered, I guess, what would be sort of considered

25:20.700 --> 25:26.320
a Dyson Sphere. Yeah. Is that Planet of Judgment or is that the other one?

25:26.520 --> 25:32.740
World without end. I like doing the technical part of that. It's not a Dyson Sphere. Well,

25:33.420 --> 25:45.080
it is a hollowed out asteroid. Burnel Sphere is more proper name for it. But I tried to work out this

25:45.080 --> 25:53.000
alien science. I've got a notebook full of stuff about how flying aliens would build their cities.

25:54.020 --> 25:57.540
That part was fun enough. I had to amuse myself sometimes.

25:58.380 --> 26:05.560
As to your writing itself, how do you go about constructing your novels? Do you come up with

26:05.560 --> 26:11.300
an idea for the novel or characters and then work them into a particular setting or what?

26:11.980 --> 26:18.100
Well, the most consistent pattern I have is working out the actual structure,

26:18.800 --> 26:27.320
the way time is handled in the novel. It sounds rather dry, but I don't like to outline the story

26:27.320 --> 26:34.680
in any detail because then there are no surprises. So I start out with the structure of the viewpoint

26:34.680 --> 26:41.040
is handled and so forth. Start working and modify the structure as the story builds. Usually I

26:41.800 --> 26:48.020
have some vague idea of how it's going to end. That becomes less vague as the novel progresses.

26:49.940 --> 26:55.400
The short stories I normally start with the character who seems interesting. Make them do something.

26:58.060 --> 27:04.020
In other words, you set up sort of a lettuce work and then you let the story build itself on that.

27:04.020 --> 27:13.320
Yeah, that seems to work better for me. Although often the structure does have to be modified halfway

27:13.320 --> 27:18.020
through. I don't, you know, want to be hit into a procrastin bed by it.

27:19.900 --> 27:26.020
What is worlds about? It's a first part of a trilogy.

27:26.700 --> 27:30.340
Yeah, well it starts out about a century from now.

27:31.580 --> 27:37.900
And it's essentially the story of a woman who grew up, was born and grew up on a space colony,

27:38.560 --> 27:46.300
a space settlement. It is sent to Earth for a year of postgraduate work or finishing, if you want to call it that.

27:46.940 --> 27:51.980
Being set up for a political position as it lives on between this world and Earth.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.140
And various strange things happened to her in the year that she's here. It's sort of a

27:58.980 --> 28:07.920
old Geltung Suramath kind of a novel. She grows by being sort of bounced around by Earth.

28:09.960 --> 28:18.280
That's, uh, and the second novel, uh, Stars, takes over for the first one ends and takes her into all age.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.860
Will all three novels be following this one character?

28:24.420 --> 28:29.200
No, she dies in the second one. I think. I haven't finished the second one.

28:31.380 --> 28:35.200
That's an interesting way of writing. You, you discover it as you write it.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.320
Yeah, yeah, that's for me.

29:03.040 --> 29:08.680
Watch for Joe Haldeman's new novel, Worlds, the first part of a trilogy coming in March from Viking Press.

29:16.220 --> 29:19.380
This is David Cruz and David Carson.

29:20.400 --> 29:26.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

29:26.100 --> 29:31.940
Association in conjunction with KOCV FM and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
