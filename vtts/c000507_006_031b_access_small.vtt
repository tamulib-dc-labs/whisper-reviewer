00:02.360 --> 00:08.160
If a human brain is a physical system that can think, is there any reason to suppose

00:08.160 --> 00:17.620
that some other system shouldn't be capable of doing likewise? And I see my answer is absolutely

00:17.620 --> 00:24.360
no reason why not. I don't see anything unique that sets the human brain. I think the question

00:24.360 --> 00:28.920
really, it becomes metaphysical. I think the question, what lurking behind or beneath

00:28.920 --> 00:37.360
the surface of this whole debate is, do we feel that the human mind can be adequately

00:37.360 --> 00:45.520
accounted for by the familiar laws of physics and no more? Or does the phenomenon of mind

00:45.520 --> 00:51.960
require something extra, some life force, some mystical agency and soul, call it what you like?

00:53.300 --> 00:57.340
And depending how we answer that question, I think that will shape our answer to the

00:57.340 --> 01:02.620
artificially intelligent issue. Personally, I feel that the human mind requires nothing

01:02.620 --> 01:11.860
extra to account for it. That being so, there's no reason why an equally complex system that

01:11.860 --> 01:19.580
happened to have come from some other origin than natural evolution. In other words, having

01:19.580 --> 01:24.080
been conceived and built by human beings, shouldn't be capable of the same.

01:24.080 --> 01:32.380
And fading on, different design parameters. In other words, a system that's designed to

01:32.380 --> 01:39.800
be good in a particular area is usually pretty bad in others. A high level interceptor jet

01:39.800 --> 01:44.640
has got excellent speed and maneuverability, but it's not much good for hauling freight.

01:45.760 --> 01:50.460
And a school bus is pretty good for getting kids to school, but it won't win many trophies

01:50.460 --> 01:58.100
on a racing circuit. Blind light, whatever you're designing for, you try and trade off

01:58.100 --> 02:07.260
things so that the specification is maximized towards getting done the things that you want

02:07.260 --> 02:15.080
the system to do. And the panel is that you pay a page in areas that you don't want it to do.

02:17.420 --> 02:25.480
Some systems are designed to be compromised and they're designed to do a wide range of

02:25.480 --> 02:30.480
things moderately well, although I suppose you couldn't argue that they excel in versatility.

02:31.240 --> 02:36.240
And probably the most versatile system that we know is the human brain. It can do pretty

02:36.240 --> 02:43.040
well anything to a degree. And we're never satisfied with its performance in any one area,

02:43.040 --> 02:48.100
so we're continually building things like microscopes and telescopes and calculating

02:48.100 --> 02:57.440
machines to improve its scope. And each one of those additional devices will excel the human brain

02:57.440 --> 03:04.360
by many orders of magnitude in its own field of specialty and be absolutely useless for anything else.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.300
Alright, I believe Daryl has a few questions.

03:10.740 --> 03:17.180
Yeah, so the point I was leading up to is that the human brain seems to be specialized in versatility

03:17.180 --> 03:27.460
and it might well be that one of nature's basic trade-offs is that thinking big and thinking small

03:27.460 --> 03:36.040
are mutually exclusive. When you lift your arm to comb your hair it requires the coordinated action

03:36.040 --> 03:44.980
of about 40 separate muscles. Now if you had to consciously monitor every step of that sequence

03:44.980 --> 03:51.020
to lift your arm, you wouldn't get much else done. You certainly wouldn't build many cities

03:51.020 --> 03:56.700
or compose many symphonies or really be very much of a high level intelligent being at all.

03:57.380 --> 04:03.060
And it seems pretty inescapable that in the course of evolution what actually happens in practice

04:03.060 --> 04:09.800
is when you think lift your arm, one high level command triggers off the whole sequence of micro-instructions

04:09.800 --> 04:15.600
that are micro-coded into the nervous system. Which is analogous to many computer operations today.

04:17.200 --> 04:23.700
And you just think one thought consciously and the rest just takes place without any further intervention on your part.

04:24.480 --> 04:32.040
And it's easy to see the survival value of a process like that and why it would be reinforced in the process of evolution.

04:32.660 --> 04:42.640
So that the level at which the human brain is mechanical, a lot of arguments against artificial intelligence that I've heard

04:42.640 --> 04:50.600
they make the point that a computer is deterministic, that its circuits function exactly the way they're programmed mechanically

04:50.600 --> 04:56.980
and they don't have any variability or whimsical behavior built into them.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.460
But at its basic hardware level this is true of the human brain also.

05:01.440 --> 05:07.000
The basic neuron of the brain is every bit as mechanical as an integrated circuit chip.

05:07.900 --> 05:17.090
If the inputs that are, the sum of the inputs that are applied to it exceed a certain threshold it will fire and if they don't it won't.

05:18.560 --> 05:26.780
The variability becomes manifest through the complexity of the organization at a far higher level, properly if you will.

05:28.000 --> 05:41.760
But we as thinking conscious totalities we manipulate abstract symbols that represent the world that we perceive and the world we live in such as places, people, emotions and things.

05:42.320 --> 05:50.540
We are not consciously aware of the mechanically precise hardware level of operation of our brains.

05:50.540 --> 05:53.380
In other words our neurons or even that we have any.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.620
Whereas it was shut off from that level of operation.

05:56.940 --> 06:05.860
An interesting thought is that if we ever built a system that was capable of emulating the human brain in all its variety of versatility

06:05.860 --> 06:16.860
we might find that one of the trade-offs that it pays for being that versatile and that general is that it gets shut off from its hardware level too.

06:16.860 --> 06:23.200
And it can't calculate, it can't remember word for word a conversation it had last week.

06:27.340 --> 06:35.340
And perhaps if it wanted to calculate pie to a couple of thousand decimal places it would have to build itself a computer or buy one.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.580
That's another good reason for imagining that maybe you wouldn't call it a computer anymore.

06:41.560 --> 06:48.360
Perhaps we should call it a biologically reproduced artificial intelligence.

06:49.260 --> 06:54.940
And since computer people deny an acronym that would certainly be short to brain which would describe it pretty well.

06:57.860 --> 06:59.600
You planned that didn't you?

07:02.840 --> 07:05.140
I wrote it somewhere in an article a while ago.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.800
Alright here are some short questions which we may use as inserts.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.320
I'll try and give you answers a little shorter.

07:13.540 --> 07:14.600
No that's okay.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.380
Which novel is your best-selling novel?

07:20.060 --> 07:22.420
In Herod the Stars because it's been on sale the longest.

07:23.980 --> 07:26.180
And been translated into the most languages.

07:27.140 --> 07:28.880
So it's the most top is.

07:28.880 --> 07:50.100
The more recent ones are selling at a faster rate than in Herod the Stars did when it was first released.

07:50.880 --> 07:51.920
If that makes sense.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.260
Do you think you could write a fantasy story?

08:02.420 --> 08:09.660
Yeah but I don't know if it would be what a lot of people have in mind when they use the word fantasy.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.540
I discussed this with a number of editors.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.600
I suppose we ought to try and agree on the definition of fantasy firstly.

08:18.600 --> 08:37.260
I would offer that my interpretation of fantasy would be stories setting, times or places in which the laws of cause and effect don't work the way they do in the universe we know.

08:37.660 --> 08:41.060
And they're not simple extrapolations from the laws we know.

08:41.840 --> 08:49.180
In other words magic works or something akin to magic.

08:50.800 --> 08:58.200
The phenomena happened which to us would be inexplicable by our laws of physics and cause and effect and we would have to describe as magic.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.840
Is that a reasonably acceptable definition of what fantasy is?

09:03.700 --> 09:04.940
I believe so.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.860
Yeah I would say that.

09:08.860 --> 09:16.950
If we're going to write in that realm I would submit that surely the opportunity is for...

09:18.800 --> 09:29.560
Well the term itself is new but the purpose it serves and the way it serves it is not really.

09:30.560 --> 09:43.800
People from the beginnings of history have had a need or have got enjoyment from escapism.

09:46.600 --> 09:55.800
Escaping for a while out of their own humdrum lives, their own humdrum places and going to places new and places different.

09:57.700 --> 10:05.980
And writers have enjoyed or storytellers have been able to...

10:05.980 --> 10:18.900
I used stretch their imagination and exercised their creativity if they were able to break out of the limitations that are imposed by geography and history as they are.

10:19.520 --> 10:24.820
And the conventions and rules of society as they happen to exist.

10:25.740 --> 10:30.560
In other words you can do so much more if you never mind the constraints of helping.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.900
Let's imagine they might be somewhere else.

10:35.020 --> 10:41.920
And in centuries gone by when the world was only partly explored it was easy to do this by simply inventing places.

10:42.620 --> 10:50.400
I think Gulliver's travels or the Arabian nights or even to an island in the Pacific or an unexplored part of South America.

10:51.460 --> 10:57.280
But of course in these days with the whole world mapped and surveyed by satellites you really can't do that credibly.

10:57.740 --> 11:08.140
And the only dimensions left in which the writer can create new worlds and shed those constraints are the dimensions of space and time which really gives a science fiction.

11:09.720 --> 11:15.160
And if we agree on that I then suggest that the fantasy writer goes one step further.

11:16.040 --> 11:28.360
The fantasy writer not only discards the constraints of history and geography and society as they happen to exist in the real world.

11:29.040 --> 11:35.680
The fantasy writer also discards the constraints of the laws of physics as they operate in the real world.

11:36.630 --> 11:55.980
And my conclusion from that would be that if the opportunity for originality, creativity, imagination to go to its limit exist anywhere they should surely exist in the field of fantasy.

11:56.840 --> 12:02.080
The opportunity is for true originality greater in no other branch of literature.

12:02.080 --> 12:06.160
I think it's rather disappointing or rather surprising.

12:06.640 --> 12:18.760
Yet time and time and time again we see the same symbols of people in clothes and medieval hats that went out of style here hundreds of years ago.

12:19.360 --> 12:22.800
Living in tax prodigies and waving swords around.

12:23.980 --> 12:29.220
It seems to me that that opportunity is not being exploited at all in a lot of cases anyway.

12:32.080 --> 12:36.620
And a number of editors have asked me to write fantasy and I said well I think about it.

12:37.080 --> 12:43.700
If I did I think I would try and use that opportunity as I think it can be and should be.

12:44.200 --> 12:49.620
It could be used if we're just retelling medieval fairy tales.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.660
I think it's almost fantasy under false pretenses.

12:52.660 --> 12:58.280
It's not really recognizing or realizing the potential of what fantasy really is.

13:02.700 --> 13:10.000
I believe if you did write a fantasy novel it would be a different type than a lot of fantasy writers are used to reading.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.780
Yeah I think it would. Whether that would be popular or a lot I don't know.

13:14.980 --> 13:20.160
And if I'd asked at this stage what would it be about the only answer is I haven't the faintest idea because I haven't thought about it.

13:21.320 --> 13:32.680
But if I did sit down and seriously think about doing something in that area it would be with the considerations that I've just outlined taken into account.

13:34.420 --> 13:38.660
What might come out of it wouldn't have only noticed if it was that obvious. I suppose it wouldn't be fantasy.

13:40.540 --> 13:50.440
Right. Has anybody approached you about movie rights than your novel so far?

13:50.940 --> 13:55.260
Yeah we've talked to a number of companies to date and nothing's come out of it.

13:56.580 --> 13:58.540
Any particular story in particular?

14:00.080 --> 14:04.500
Oh inherit the stars, two faces mainly.

14:06.140 --> 14:07.600
I'd love to see inherit the stars.

14:07.980 --> 14:15.140
So with regards to the future who knows maybe. I think it's the only safe thing to say at this stage.

14:16.500 --> 14:23.960
We don't take that as an indication that anything is positively moving on that front at this point in time as far as I'm aware it is.

14:24.720 --> 14:29.520
Yeah I was just curious. This is what we probably show this just goes in our information file.

14:30.440 --> 14:37.520
We keep all the tapes that we tape, the master tapes are unedited. We copy them off on a copy tapes and edit those.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.940
Are we in interview time now or is this just chit chat?

14:41.220 --> 14:42.020
This is just chit chat.

14:42.180 --> 14:59.480
Oh it's just chit chat.

14:59.480 --> 15:06.340
I'm getting quite interested in two faces of tomorrow but I think in the end he decided not to go ahead.

15:06.700 --> 15:15.940
My own impression is, this is of course my own opinion, Erwin Allen has never been able to handle science fiction.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.820
He has never really got a grasp of it.

15:19.380 --> 15:25.560
Well I haven't been very impressed if we're not being broadcast if this is just between us.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.300
I'm not very impressed by many science fiction movies to be honest.

15:29.600 --> 15:35.520
Yeah, just out of curiosity, which one out of the science fiction movies would you find impressive?

15:36.380 --> 15:36.760
Which one?

15:37.080 --> 15:37.300
Yeah.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.260
I missed the question. Which one is there like?

15:39.540 --> 15:42.960
Which one would you think would be a good science fiction movie?

15:44.140 --> 15:44.840
Out of the books.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.520
No, out of the movies.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.540
What do you think would be a good science fiction movie?

15:50.020 --> 15:50.960
Which movies were good?

15:51.260 --> 15:51.440
Yes.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.420
I haven't seen many of them mainly because I don't like the ones I did see.

15:54.420 --> 16:02.360
I remember being very impressed by 2001.

16:04.280 --> 16:14.280
It's very in mind that it came out sometime around the mid-sectus and I thought that the technical detail and the authenticity was exceptional.

16:15.560 --> 16:25.160
And I was on the edge of my feet looking forward to a really, you know, the whole thing to develop into a really crisp story with a...

16:25.880 --> 16:31.100
I must confess I was a little let down. I didn't understand the ending. I don't know what happened.

16:32.020 --> 16:37.260
You know, Arthur went into this abstract symbolic kind of thing and it didn't mean anything to me.

16:37.560 --> 16:41.920
I had dinner one night without the clock and I said Arthur what did the ending of 2001 mean?

16:41.920 --> 16:42.940
And he said I don't know.

16:45.500 --> 16:51.500
It's...coubrekin that various movie people wanted to end it one way and somebody wanted to end it another way.

16:51.680 --> 16:55.640
And Arthur said he just walked away and let them tell it and he didn't ever understood what they ended up with either.

16:56.220 --> 17:06.920
So I think that's kind of a council or puts to rest a lot of the very, very ingenious interpretations that I've listened to from the most people.

17:07.580 --> 17:11.000
That's good. I'd had heard that story before. I'm going to remember that one.

17:11.000 --> 17:24.860
Yeah. But in fact, there's really no secret because I told Arthur this that 2001 was one of the factors that inspired me to write Inherit the Stars.

17:25.500 --> 17:39.080
I loved the idea of something being found, a mystery being uncovered in the course of lunar exploration that was sufficiently intriguing to motivate a lot of scientists into unraveling it.

17:39.880 --> 17:47.960
It seemed a good opportunity to set the scientific detective story that I wanted to write.

17:48.640 --> 17:56.680
You know, okay, let's have the detective story or the mystery that the detectives are trying to solve hinge around something that's turned up on the moon.

17:57.340 --> 18:01.300
Well, dead bodies are always pretty good for detective stories.

18:03.320 --> 18:08.640
It ought to be a more interesting dead body than the standard detective thriller.

18:08.880 --> 18:14.920
So let's make it 15,000 years old and human, which raises the whole, opens up the whole bag of words.

18:15.580 --> 18:17.200
And that's just the how they unravel that.

18:17.640 --> 18:26.400
And I wanted the ending to be a bit of a twist, a bit unexpected, a bit of a surprise.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.440
But nevertheless, plausible and rational within the context of the story.

18:31.560 --> 18:42.300
I didn't want to bring in mystical agencies or strange laws of physics or anything like this to hold it together.

18:42.900 --> 18:55.080
And you did what every good mystery writer does is give the reader enough information to solve the mystery himself if he's got the perception to do it.

18:55.080 --> 19:02.480
I think so. I think that's on his fiction too. I think Tony suspense, cheating and holding back information from the reader.

19:03.560 --> 19:14.880
Darling, that's good fiction. I think that if writers who do that, because they're trying to create an atmosphere of mystery and make the reader curious,

19:15.060 --> 19:17.800
I don't think that's a fair way of going about it.

19:18.360 --> 19:25.280
I think in fairness, as a courtesy to the reader, the reader should know as much as the characters know.

19:27.300 --> 19:32.920
And I think it's kind of weak where you know the character knows something and the writer won't tell you what it is.

19:33.560 --> 19:37.420
He's almost playing games with the reader. I know something you don't know.

19:38.280 --> 19:45.400
That's not fair. I think that this information becomes available to the characters so the reader should become aware of it.

19:45.400 --> 19:49.300
So the reader has the same opportunity as the character to figure it out.

19:51.000 --> 20:05.700
And the suspense and the reader's curiosity should be aroused by more skillful methods than simply depriving them of information and keeping them guessing.

20:05.700 --> 20:14.720
Well, of teasing them. Yes, they should be kept guessing, but not by being cheated.

20:19.320 --> 20:25.700
Yeah, I may have to retract my statement here about this not being used. That was such an extraordinarily good answer.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.080
We may incorporate that into a future program.

20:28.500 --> 20:33.520
Sure, I mean if you want to use that, that's fine. It's just when we were mentioning names like Arthur Clark and Irwin Allen,

20:34.480 --> 20:38.200
I think if we're going out in public, I'd rather just edit those out.

20:38.740 --> 20:46.420
Oh yeah, that's no problem. Now the thing on mystery writing, because we're going to eventually produce a program on science fiction detective stories,

20:46.480 --> 20:56.480
because there aren't a whole lot of them. And since we'll have this on our information tape, if we ever do, we'll call you up and tell you that we're doing it, and then we'll send you a copy tape of it.

20:56.480 --> 21:04.940
Oh well, I trust you integrity. But I think if we're talking about personal things that were said over lunch, you need confidence.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.460
I prefer not to go completely like that.

21:08.620 --> 21:09.480
No, we wouldn't do that.

21:09.800 --> 21:10.040
Okay.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.760
Well, I've exhausted my supply of questions.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.980
Personally, I happen to enjoy your work very, very much.

21:24.800 --> 21:25.360
Thank you.

21:25.360 --> 21:39.380
In fact, one of the things that, oh yeah, our students in our science fiction class that we're teaching this semester at the college are reading your novel, Inherit the Stars, is one of the novels for the class.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.380
I'm great to hear it.

21:41.700 --> 21:49.000
And this radio show will be aired the weekend before they meet in class, so they'll be hearing these conversations before we talk about it in class.

21:49.380 --> 21:49.600
Fine.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.460
It just so happens that it works out that way.

21:52.460 --> 21:59.180
Well, you can tell them if they enjoy it, they like the General Giants, and there's a third one in the pipeline, and it'll be out in-gen.

21:59.560 --> 21:59.760
Yeah.

22:00.820 --> 22:09.880
Now yeah, we've remarked that on some instances after reading some of your stuff, I wonder if we just can't go out to Radio Shack and buy enough parts to build some of those things.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.060
I get a lot of others like that.

22:14.900 --> 22:35.160
But I think it is rewarding that your comment on learning is one that appears frequently as well, that people do seem to find this kind of fiction stimulating, and that it gives them the urge to want to get up and get out and do something meaningful.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.300
And, well, surely that's a good thing.

22:40.300 --> 22:51.860
I think just my own observation would be that we're so bombarded by war and things that are going wrong and things don't work out.

22:52.660 --> 22:57.680
And yet, in your novel, as you show us society that if you work at it, things can work out.

22:58.060 --> 22:59.780
I think that's what I'm trying to say.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.400
I think it could, I think it can.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.500
It doesn't guarantee that it will.

23:04.820 --> 23:11.040
I think there is a borderline between optimism and naive innocence.

23:12.900 --> 23:24.400
I think it's kind of healthily optimistic to recognize that we, I think we have it in our, in our, in our future lives entirely in our own hands.

23:24.400 --> 23:34.300
But it's not a new observation these days to look out across the size of the universe we live in.

23:35.620 --> 23:43.860
And even really the pictures that we see through the palom or telescope and things like that really don't convey the vastness.

23:44.340 --> 23:51.820
Our own galaxy contains something like a couple of hundred billion stars, I believe.

23:52.800 --> 24:01.040
It's 100,000 light years in diameter, light would say to 100,000 years to cross just our galaxy.

24:02.100 --> 24:05.800
And that sounds what it is, an unimaginable distance.

24:06.180 --> 24:11.460
And yet, that galaxy, there are more galaxies than anybody can count.

24:11.900 --> 24:16.180
Gretel and Starr, the number of galaxies is just beyond counting.

24:16.180 --> 24:26.940
And the best analogy that modern science can come up with of the universe is that of a gas of galaxy molecules.

24:28.620 --> 24:35.900
Imagine the number of molecules swirling around in the room that you're sitting in.

24:35.940 --> 24:37.860
And imagine every one of those is a galaxy.

24:38.720 --> 24:42.200
And every one of those galaxies contains their hundred billion stars.

24:44.100 --> 24:48.300
And you happen to be on a little ball of mud that's attached to one of them.

24:49.140 --> 24:56.720
It ain't much. And I don't really feel anything intimidating about this.

24:57.120 --> 25:02.500
Yeah, we're insignificant in terms of the universe, but looked at in another way.

25:02.720 --> 25:06.260
It is very exhilarating and very liberating.

25:07.360 --> 25:15.540
Because what it really says is that we are not cogs in a cockwork machine that somebody has programmed the rules for.

25:16.260 --> 25:21.800
That we're doomed or not, depending on somebody else's whim.

25:22.780 --> 25:31.960
That we are a totally self-sufficient, self-determining species.

25:34.220 --> 25:40.220
And the limits to expansion and growth around us, potentially, are limitless.

25:41.480 --> 25:53.780
There are no limits, I believe, to how far and how high the human species can expand, both in terms of how far it can travel and the things it can achieve.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.200
I think it's entirely up to us.

26:00.740 --> 26:15.740
And I think it's an exercise in self-deception to rely on big brothers in the sky or magical forces to solve our problems for us or make our problems go away.

26:16.660 --> 26:17.580
They won't.

26:18.960 --> 26:25.860
But the realization that we have the ability and the opportunity to do it, I find is very exciting.

26:26.380 --> 26:34.720
But if we make a mess of it, and there's no guarantee that we won't, there's certainly no doubt that the universe won't miss us.

26:35.320 --> 26:40.880
If that one little speck of dust vanishes, the rest of the gas of galaxies isn't even going to see the difference.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.040
So it really is entirely up to us.

26:46.660 --> 26:50.260
And we hear a lot of talk about freedom these days.

26:50.740 --> 26:56.600
Of course, freedom and responsibility are different sides of the same coin.

26:57.000 --> 27:09.620
If you are totally free to determine your course of action and nobody places any constraints on you, then by the same token you are responsible for the consequences of those actions.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.880
And I think we've got that coin.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.660
I think we are totally free to do anything we choose.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.600
There are no constraints. There are no limits. I think we have the potential.

27:21.800 --> 27:36.100
We also have the responsibility to our thoughts, I think that's the thing that as a race week we need to wake up to and acknowledge because with the levels of power that we're beginning to harness and play with,

27:37.260 --> 27:39.240
it's becoming a very serious issue.

27:39.920 --> 27:56.060
I don't think the solution is to run away from the responsibility and go back to playing with windmills or wood burning stoves or primitive levels of existence as some people would advocate that we do.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.800
I think that's an abdication.

27:58.980 --> 28:19.340
I think we need to realize that the next run upwards on the ladder of evolution that we're on requires us to comprehend those forces that we're beginning to understand and learn how to use them responsibly.

28:22.340 --> 28:43.060
And I think that all the, you mentioned war a little while ago, yes we have the potential to wipe ourselves out and I think we also on the other side of the coin we also have the ability to solve the problems that a war would otherwise be fought over.

28:43.060 --> 29:09.900
It makes sense to me to talk about fighting a global war over a little bit of oil under the desert, a few metals and mineral ore in South Africa or something like that because the little pockets of energy that happened to be trapped around the surface of this planet are just our investment capital for starting the business.

29:10.820 --> 29:14.340
No business has to run forever on its investment capital.

29:14.820 --> 29:20.700
If that's just your startup capital you invest that and make the profit to pay your way as your business grows and expands.

29:21.940 --> 29:26.900
And I think that's true that with energy and with other resources too.

29:26.900 --> 29:45.120
I think resources only finite within the context of a given level of technology and when you go through a, when civilization goes through a phase change into the higher level of technology the resources that were previously finite seem to be relevant.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.100
It doesn't matter anymore.

29:47.700 --> 30:01.440
The economy in history depended on animal power and slaves, horses, how much wood you could carry and limited the extent to which earlier economies could be stretched.

30:02.080 --> 30:06.120
They're totally irrelevant in the context of today's high technology economy.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.320
We worry about oil and gas and things.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.880
I say yes they're finite and yes they won't last forever.

30:12.060 --> 30:21.340
I don't think it matters a damn because we're likely to, we could be, into technologies far more advanced in which fossil fuels are simply irrelevant.

30:21.620 --> 30:25.820
It's just not worth the cost or the messing around and drilling them out the ground anymore.

30:26.060 --> 30:27.940
I think that could happen long before they run out.

30:29.100 --> 30:41.180
So I don't particularly see that as an area to get concerned over unless people become trapped in the straight jacket of their own narrow short-term thinking.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.560
I believe it's worth fighting a war over.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.260
I don't think it is.

30:45.320 --> 30:48.540
Which is, again, not to say that everybody will see it that way.

30:51.580 --> 31:01.300
Yeah, I think lots of times we probably end up being manipulated by the media that we are bombarded with all the time.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.300
I miss that, Dave.

31:04.060 --> 31:08.060
Lots of times I think we're manipulated by the media that we're bombarded with all the time.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.620
You know, the newspapers and TV.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.820
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of this goes on.

31:12.420 --> 31:15.760
I'm not so sure that as much of it goes on as some people seem to think.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.040
I'm sure a lot of it does.

31:19.180 --> 31:26.000
I'm sure a lot of vested interests are tied up with stretching our existing technologies for a little while longer yet.

31:26.300 --> 31:38.440
A lot of money has been invested in refineries and tankers and mining rights and drilling rights and that kind of thing.

31:39.440 --> 31:44.940
I'm sure it's in the interest of a lot of powerful lobbies to keep us using those things for a while longer yet.

31:44.940 --> 31:47.920
I don't really see that as sinister or unethical.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.620
I suppose it is in some ways, but it's good business sense in other ways.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.280
We're taking the long term view.

31:54.380 --> 31:57.960
I think that when the need gets acute enough, then we will solve the problem.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.560
I have no doubt we have the ability to do it.

32:01.360 --> 32:04.840
I just hope that happens before anybody starts pressing button.

32:05.360 --> 32:14.640
Yeah, I think one of the best examples I could think of is, I believe it was Brazil that converted all their cars,

32:14.640 --> 32:19.680
most of their gas using cars to alcohol.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.220
Ford Motor Company is making the cars for them.

32:25.040 --> 32:25.960
And they did that.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.900
Of course, they have a fairly efficient form of government.

32:29.100 --> 32:29.460
It's a dictatorship.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.420
I don't think it could work.

32:31.740 --> 32:36.060
They have a different economic framework.

32:36.320 --> 32:37.620
It wouldn't work in the United States.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.340
They have a stricter form of government.

32:40.340 --> 32:41.740
They have the lower wages.

32:45.140 --> 32:49.160
I hesitate to use the word test because of its derogatory connotations.

32:49.480 --> 32:57.680
But a lot of human labor goes into harvesting the cane and the biomass that makes the alcohol.

32:57.960 --> 33:01.400
And human labor that is cheap and freely available, that low wages.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.420
And you can sell it at the pump for far less than you could sell it for in this country.

33:05.680 --> 33:08.660
Where do you get your army of laborers to harvest the stuff here?

33:09.300 --> 33:12.040
I think it's a very inefficient solution to the problem anyway.

33:13.500 --> 33:17.500
The value of liquid fuels and sources that they provide,

33:17.700 --> 33:21.620
the terms and storage of energy, and that they are portable and highly concentrated.

33:22.040 --> 33:27.340
I think that our high technology knows how,

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
and our investment capital will be far better

33:29.500 --> 33:36.400
put into developing nuclear processes planned out and using hydrogen-based economies.

33:37.200 --> 33:41.520
Yeah, I was reading something in the whole,

33:42.220 --> 33:49.940
as either popular mechanics or one of them, that theoretical hydrogen powered cars.

33:50.380 --> 33:53.740
Sure, I think lucky to experiment with hydrogen-fueled aircraft.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.900
And it burns clean, and I think there are some problems.

34:00.020 --> 34:03.040
This may have changed, but from something I read a while ago,

34:03.040 --> 34:10.260
I think that the storage efficiency in terms of the calories you store for town weight,

34:11.380 --> 34:13.360
not as high as you get from gasoline,

34:13.680 --> 34:19.320
but I think with the kind of development capital that they've been talking about,

34:19.480 --> 34:26.500
up until recently anyway, about putting into converting coal and things like that,

34:26.580 --> 34:29.780
to liquids, in what my opinion is a lot of nonsense.

34:29.780 --> 34:34.640
But I think it's probably an extremely important or a high-intensity appeal.

34:35.720 --> 34:43.080
A lot of people produce a lot of sums about to show you how much energy you could get from this source or that source,

34:43.240 --> 34:50.060
but a very important quantity that is not mentioned and recognized often enough is energy density.

34:52.460 --> 34:57.900
The density at which you harness energy is a very important indicator

34:57.900 --> 35:02.700
of how efficiently the efficiency of the process is.

35:02.940 --> 35:06.880
You're getting smarter things done more efficiently.

35:08.820 --> 35:15.900
For instance, as an example, a simple arithmetic would enable you to calculate how much wood you'd need to burn

35:15.900 --> 35:23.040
to lift 300 people across the Atlantic, or to release the energy to lift 300 people across the Atlantic.

35:23.040 --> 35:26.260
But now, outside, we're building a wood burning 747.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.460
It won't work. It's just not dense enough.

35:30.560 --> 35:35.000
You need jet fuel, a far more highly concentrated form,

35:35.160 --> 35:41.020
to make power plants small enough and light enough to lift themselves in a payload off the ground.

35:42.240 --> 35:49.540
Now, the density of nuclear processes is four millions of times higher,

35:49.540 --> 35:53.380
and in the case of fusion theoretically, trillions of times higher

35:53.380 --> 35:59.860
than anything you could get from rupturing any chemical bond, and I think it's a primary energy source.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.920
That's the way we have to go.

36:04.240 --> 36:11.580
And that's for storing the energy that, in a convenient form, for example, for transportation,

36:12.980 --> 36:17.200
hydrogen, cyan, and hydrolyquid hydrogen, or some form of hydrogen based on that,

36:18.100 --> 36:21.240
which is plentiful enough in the oceans.

36:23.000 --> 36:34.740
And if you look beyond, people think of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion as just another way of running a generating plant, but it's not.

36:35.860 --> 36:44.960
It is kind of a breakthrough into a whole realm of potential technologies that have the promise of springlining

36:44.960 --> 36:49.780
and cleaning up and generally compacting a whole range of industrial processes.

36:51.740 --> 37:00.020
For example, at the temperature of nuclear plasmas, sea water cracks firmly into hydrogen and oxygen,

37:01.780 --> 37:05.420
far more efficiently than it can be achieved by electrolysis.

37:07.040 --> 37:13.160
So as a byproduct of a nuclear process, you have the possibility of producing very, very cheap hydrogen

37:13.160 --> 37:15.160
on an industrial scale.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.940
De-sale the nation of sea water is another possibility, which this year we've seen the problems,

37:21.300 --> 37:29.700
the water problems associated with industry and agriculture, producing lots of fresh water and the energy to pump it the places it's needed.

37:30.720 --> 37:36.540
It is another whole area that is opened up when you can control energy at this volume and this density.

37:37.540 --> 37:39.500
Primary metals extraction is another.

37:40.860 --> 37:53.260
At the temperature of nuclear plasmas, 10, 100 million degrees Kelvin, any substance breaks down into raw atomic nuclei with all the electrons stripped off.

37:54.040 --> 38:04.620
Every compound breaks up into raw nuclei, which are highly charged and can therefore be separated very easily and very cheaply, magnetically.

38:06.560 --> 38:18.000
Every kind of desert rock sand construction debris contains traces of aluminum, titanium, copper, manganese, you name it,

38:18.480 --> 38:26.560
just about every important metal, but it's just not economic to try and extract it by conventional processes.

38:26.860 --> 38:28.800
But at nuclear temperatures that doesn't apply.

38:29.880 --> 38:40.360
So you can start shovel desert sand through a fusion plasma and then separate out the ions magnetically.

38:40.860 --> 38:44.500
And who needs South Africa for minerals? Get it all out of Arizona?

38:45.180 --> 38:45.720
True.

38:46.320 --> 38:57.140
And you have the potential perhaps for obsoleteing overnight all of our cumbersome and expensive primary metals processing and extraction industry.

38:57.140 --> 39:03.720
And when you develop that technology here, you can take it to the moon and that's how you build your space for the new starships.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.580
Yeah, I hope so.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.940
Of course, can we get carried away then?

39:11.460 --> 39:13.820
Yeah, I enjoy getting carried away though.

39:15.440 --> 39:22.080
Yeah, hopefully I've been talking with several writers and I really do enjoy it.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.440
It's very interesting to talk with somebody whose book you've read.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.860
And I'm beginning to get the writing bug myself.

39:31.940 --> 39:33.680
If I could only spell, I'd be alright.

39:34.360 --> 39:39.280
Well, like everything else, it's one of those things that nobody was born knowing.

39:40.580 --> 39:44.060
Shakespeare had to learn to spell once and Einstein had to learn to count.

39:45.680 --> 39:45.740
Yeah.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.160
Every expert in anything was a beginner sometime.

39:50.680 --> 39:51.760
A point well taken.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.700
Do you see yourself getting out to California in the foreseeable future?

39:56.540 --> 39:57.480
I don't know.

39:57.800 --> 40:02.240
A devil will be out there and I believe he lives less than 100 miles from where you are.

40:02.240 --> 40:07.400
Well, you know, it goes without saying if any of you find yourself over here with some time to spare,

40:07.580 --> 40:11.940
you're welcome to call us and see if we can get together or something.

40:12.760 --> 40:16.220
Oh yeah, I'd really like that.

40:16.380 --> 40:20.180
So consider that an open invitation if any of you and your friends are around this way.

40:20.360 --> 40:25.820
What if you ever get out toward Texas and in between nowhere and nowhere at all, that's where we are.

40:27.500 --> 40:34.640
I'd throw three Texas three times in November, always in the middle of the night it seems.

40:35.660 --> 40:39.280
Well, if you drove through the West part, you didn't miss anything, there wasn't anything there to see.

40:40.860 --> 40:42.240
I don't feel for that about it.

40:42.540 --> 40:47.320
Yeah, well actually I take it back, the country out here kind of grows on the air for a while.

40:47.380 --> 40:52.120
In fact, I think we probably have some of the most beautiful sunsets they'll ever find anywhere

40:52.120 --> 40:56.180
because of the inversion layers and stuff we get out here.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.000
Every color on the rainbow is up in the sky.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.520
Well, you see you're looking west to Adam and we got him right here.

41:02.700 --> 41:06.020
Yeah, oh yeah, it was dark a long time ago here.

41:10.460 --> 41:13.820
Are you going to be at the World Con in Denver?

41:14.700 --> 41:15.860
I haven't decided yet.

41:16.820 --> 41:17.400
I don't know.

41:18.220 --> 41:18.660
Maybe.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.820
Yeah, if you do go we will be there, at least if we have enough money we'll be there.

41:24.200 --> 41:29.280
Yeah, I'm not a good thing or a bad thing but it happens to be a fact.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.520
I'm really not a regular convention goer.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.900
I go to summits, I really enjoy them.

41:38.020 --> 41:42.800
I suppose probably the reason is, this is just a personal suspicion,

41:42.800 --> 41:50.180
but I think I got into being a science fiction writer from probably the diametrically the opposite direction

41:50.180 --> 41:53.180
from the majority of science fiction writers.

41:53.960 --> 42:00.840
I think it's more normal for young people to get interested in science fiction,

42:01.200 --> 42:06.160
typically through friends at college or university who eventually persuade them to go to a convention.

42:06.880 --> 42:13.820
And in a lot of cases they find an environment they enjoy, they find stimulating people they can relate to and it becomes a habit.

42:15.580 --> 42:22.500
And some of those form the ambition to want to contribute something to this genre themselves,

42:22.760 --> 42:25.040
so they start to write something and submit it.

42:25.600 --> 42:29.920
Some of them are lucky and accepted, then they try a novel.

42:30.660 --> 42:33.880
And ten years later there is another writer sitting up on the panel.

42:34.660 --> 42:40.880
And of course during that process the convention going to conventions and being part of conventions

42:40.880 --> 42:47.040
has already become part of a lifestyle that they've absorbed and I really never did.

42:47.760 --> 42:53.480
So I kind of go to them occasionally to see what's happening and to see people and to be sociable,

42:53.700 --> 43:02.060
but I suppose it never started out as part of a pattern of life in years away gone by.

43:03.020 --> 43:07.740
I've never been to a science fiction, well I guess you could call this a convention,

43:07.980 --> 43:11.580
they're having some sort of Star Trek gizmo and Dallas and I stopped by to see what it was.

43:12.640 --> 43:19.340
But I've never really been to a science fiction convention per se.

43:19.720 --> 43:24.640
Well I went to the World Times Boston last year, which was, I enjoyed them,

43:24.780 --> 43:30.740
the World Convention, well the one I've been to was the experience, was pretty huge.

43:30.740 --> 43:33.120
There's only 6,000 people there in several hotels.

43:34.500 --> 43:39.980
And you can spend a whole damn weekend looking for one person that you particularly wanted to meet.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.340
So they can be pretty overpowering.

43:43.680 --> 43:48.940
I've found the small local ones very enjoyable.

43:49.780 --> 43:54.100
Just sort of one day with a hundred or two people.

43:54.580 --> 43:58.100
And in that one day you see everybody and talk to everybody.

43:59.980 --> 44:01.800
There can be a lot of fun too.

44:02.300 --> 44:06.400
Yeah, it is a group that gets together in New Mexico.

44:08.080 --> 44:11.780
We're not too far from New Mexico, we measure things in Texas distances,

44:11.780 --> 44:14.200
so it's nothing to go 400 miles to see somebody.

44:16.340 --> 44:19.380
You couldn't drive out of England without falling off the edge.

44:19.380 --> 44:24.480
And then you go into the water and into the channel on the other.

44:26.140 --> 44:29.820
But now people out here don't take anything going to Dallas to go shopping.

44:31.180 --> 44:33.640
Don't even think twice about it.

44:34.300 --> 44:35.600
How far down is it?

44:36.680 --> 44:37.540
380 miles.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.760
Of course most of the time they fly up there.

44:41.480 --> 44:42.820
Texas has its own airline.

44:43.940 --> 44:46.920
Texas is a strange and wonderful place.

44:48.240 --> 44:52.160
But you can fly up to Dallas and back for 50 bucks.

44:54.520 --> 44:58.000
I'm reaching the point where if I have to get in the car it's a long way.

44:58.920 --> 45:04.420
One of the big attractions of moving to the town I'm living in now is...

45:04.420 --> 45:08.880
It's kind of one of those quite old-fashioned friendly towns.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.380
About 20,000-30,000 people maybe.

45:11.380 --> 45:15.080
But the sidewalks are busy with people.

45:17.400 --> 45:21.120
They shop, shops that are side by side.

45:21.360 --> 45:23.520
And the people stop and talk to you.

45:25.420 --> 45:27.260
And you can walk anywhere.

45:28.380 --> 45:29.380
It isn't like...

45:30.040 --> 45:33.920
I found Orlando was a little like a miniature Los Angeles.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.380
It was like an airport with houses on.

45:37.120 --> 45:39.380
And you couldn't do anything when you were getting in the car.

45:39.380 --> 45:40.840
And this is one of the things...

45:40.840 --> 45:42.940
I like this country. That's why I came to live here.

45:43.160 --> 45:48.520
But one of the aspects of a lot of Americans it is that I haven't got used to.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.200
And don't think I ever will.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.200
Is having to get in a car to do anything.

45:53.260 --> 45:54.380
And it is nice here.

45:54.580 --> 45:58.400
I think 80% of the places I want to go I can just put the jacket on and walk.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.360
Because we live in the town center.

46:01.900 --> 46:04.820
Yeah. Our society is built around the car.

46:05.140 --> 46:05.840
It really is.

46:05.840 --> 46:08.560
I guess that's probably okay if you grew up with it.

46:10.900 --> 46:12.920
It's kind of harder to get used to if you didn't.

46:13.580 --> 46:15.380
If I grew up in the center of London.

46:16.380 --> 46:18.400
You can walk anywhere you want to go.

46:18.540 --> 46:22.000
And if you don't want to walk there's lots of buses and lots of two subways.

46:23.700 --> 46:25.040
Most people didn't own a car.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.460
I never did till I moved out of London.

46:30.440 --> 46:32.060
I hear people...

46:32.060 --> 46:33.720
One person may own a couple of cars.

46:34.820 --> 46:37.800
One person may buy himself two or three cars just to keep him busy.

46:38.960 --> 46:40.820
Not anymore. They get too expensive.
