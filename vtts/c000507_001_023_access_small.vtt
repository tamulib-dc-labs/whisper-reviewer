00:08.860 --> 00:12.800
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.460 --> 00:38.060
And here are your hosts.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.060
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

00:44.620 --> 00:47.560
Ray Bradbury has tried just about every form of writing an author can undertake.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.620
Short stories, novels, poetry plays, even an opera.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.160
And he's also written numerous television and movie scripts.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.500
He used to write shows back in the 60s for Twilight Zone and offered Hitchcock.

01:12.420 --> 01:16.820
We asked Bradbury if he still does television scripts, particularly the kind that are written

01:16.820 --> 01:17.820
on cue with the deadline.

01:18.820 --> 01:21.160
Well, I tried never to do that anyway.

01:21.600 --> 01:29.520
I had a very friendly relationship with Alfred Hitchcock and all of his partners, Daryl

01:29.520 --> 01:31.560
Jones Harrison and Norman Lloyd.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.020
I'd go out and have a casual lunch, tell them an idea.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.720
They'd okay it.

01:36.740 --> 01:41.680
I'd go home and write it and come back with a finished script and we'd have another lunch.

01:42.040 --> 01:45.240
If they could argue me into any changes, I'd make them.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.880
And if I could argue them into the logic of my situation, it stayed the way it was.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.960
So it was a very amiable, very friendly thing.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.140
I never did a lot of scripts.

01:55.800 --> 02:01.880
I wouldn't let myself get bullied into being a full-time writer because no one remembers

02:01.880 --> 02:04.060
who writes scripts for television anyway.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.320
Bradbury still writes for television occasionally.

02:07.820 --> 02:11.800
Last year he had two shows that were successful, The Electric Grandmother and Any Friend of

02:11.800 --> 02:13.360
Nicholas Nicolby is a friend of mine.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.160
That last work is based on a play Bradbury had written.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.240
We asked him how many of his plays had been produced.

02:19.340 --> 02:25.180
Oh, I would say somewhere around 14 or 15 of them.

02:25.260 --> 02:26.960
Most of them I produced myself.

02:27.980 --> 02:32.380
Dan Limewine here on the coast recently, back east a few years ago.

02:33.140 --> 02:36.440
The Martian Chronicles which I produced here at a small theater.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.480
Fahrenheit 451, two years ago which turned out very well.

02:41.960 --> 02:46.360
The wonderful ice cream suit and six or seven of my one-act plays.

02:47.100 --> 02:52.260
I've had the Anthem Sprinters which is all of my Irish experiences.

02:53.300 --> 02:58.180
So I've had a lot of fun with it and I've made a lot of friends among actors.

02:58.680 --> 03:03.700
I've worked with a lot of good people including James Whitmore who appeared in my first one-act

03:03.700 --> 03:09.120
play here and had a benefit for the United Nations about 23 years ago.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.920
It's obvious from all of Bradbury's fiction that he is a lover of books.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.380
Fahrenheit 451 is a good example of that.

03:15.780 --> 03:20.080
We wondered then how he could devote so much energy to the visual arts like television or the movies.

03:21.220 --> 03:23.320
I grew up with all these loves.

03:23.480 --> 03:28.340
If I have any capacity at all it's to be in love in six or seven different ways.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.580
So I've always been madly in love with motion pictures.

03:31.900 --> 03:36.900
My mother was a fiend for them and took me to see hundreds of films.

03:37.480 --> 03:43.300
From the age of when I was two until up until I was 10, 11 or 12.

03:43.620 --> 03:49.780
So that never left me and I think I'm very fortunate to have a great love of films,

03:49.920 --> 03:55.420
a great love of libraries and books, a great love of radio and the famous people in radio.

03:55.700 --> 04:02.880
When I came west to live in Los Angeles I headed downtown immediately and got to know all the people

04:02.880 --> 04:09.940
on an old radio broadcast called Hollywood Hotel and Laurel Parsons became a friend to this

04:10.640 --> 04:19.580
13, 14 year old boy and I knew Burns and Allen during those years of 1934, 35, 36.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.500
I wrote scripts for them every week and handed them in.

04:23.680 --> 04:31.540
Of course I doubt if they even read them but they pretended that they did and they were very kind to me.

04:31.540 --> 04:37.920
And then I was in love with Orson Welles when he came on the scene in radio and suspense

04:38.560 --> 04:43.360
and Norman Corwin who became my friend when I was 27 years old.

04:43.760 --> 04:51.200
So I grew up then with a love of libraries, a love of radio, a love of films and I think I'm very lucky

04:51.200 --> 04:57.340
that I've been able to work in all of these different mediums and do rather well in each one of them.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.660
More next time with Ray Bradbury.

05:06.860 --> 05:11.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:11.700 --> 05:15.540
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:04.380 --> 06:08.320
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:31.980 --> 06:33.660
And here are your hosts.

06:37.780 --> 06:42.440
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Ray Bradbury, who most readers recognize as a

06:42.440 --> 06:47.020
Science Fiction author, has been writing poetry for most of his life. And he publishes it regularly too

06:47.020 --> 06:51.100
in all sorts of magazines every so often the poems are collected together in a single volume.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.780
There have been four of these collections so far. When elephants last in the doryard bloomed,

06:56.180 --> 07:01.280
where robot mice and robot men run around in robot towns, the haunted computer and the android pope,

07:01.280 --> 07:03.800
and most recently the complete poems of Ray Bradbury.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.220
We asked Bradbury when he sits down to write what determines what will come out,

07:22.420 --> 07:25.360
a story, a novel, a play, an opera, whatever.

07:31.280 --> 07:37.160
When I'm writing a poem, I'll say, oh my, this is too big for a poem. I may very well finish the poem,

07:37.220 --> 07:43.820
but then I sit down and turn it into a short story immediately, or on a rare occasion it turns into a

07:44.420 --> 07:50.140
stage play or a novel. But that doesn't happen as often. Most of the time I work in the short form.

07:51.640 --> 07:59.500
But quite often you take the simplest idea and it evolves from the poetry form

08:00.060 --> 08:06.860
into, well, I was, for instance, I was driving around in England a few years ago,

08:07.100 --> 08:15.720
and a chauffeur of our car was talking about driving in the Irish and funerals, the Irish wakes and what

08:15.720 --> 08:21.500
have you, and he told of this one wake of some friends of his in a small town in Ireland,

08:22.220 --> 08:28.620
where an English lord lived nearby. When he died, he went against the old saying,

08:28.620 --> 08:35.440
you can't take it with you, and he took with him all of his wine, and he had all the thousands of

08:35.440 --> 08:42.760
bottles of wine in his cellar poured into his grave. Well, it was such a great idea that I

08:42.760 --> 08:48.680
wrote it as a short story last week and sent it off, and it'll probably be in playboy sometime in

08:48.680 --> 08:53.940
the next three or four, five months. We asked Bradbury if he could name one or two of his favorite

08:53.940 --> 08:59.080
poems from his own work. At the time I write them, of course, I think each one is good,

08:59.120 --> 09:04.640
or I wouldn't have put it in the book. I try not to ever publish a poem or a short story that I've

09:05.580 --> 09:13.340
gotten tired of. With his incredibly busy schedule, will he continue to write poetry? Oh, yes, yes, yes.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.260
Those science fiction fans who might have been surprised that Bradbury writes poetry have

09:25.260 --> 09:28.900
another surprise ahead of them. When we asked Bradbury if there was a form of writing he hadn't

09:28.900 --> 09:35.960
tried yet, his answer contained a mild shocker. I can't think of anything offhand. Now that I'm

09:35.960 --> 09:43.080
working on this libretto for this opera, that sort of rounds out the list, I would, I'm working on

09:43.080 --> 09:49.060
a detective murder mystery novel now, which I've never done before, so it's a new, it's a change for

09:49.060 --> 09:55.680
me in the novel form. I've been a great lover and admirer of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler

09:55.680 --> 10:02.680
for the last 40 years or so, and I always wanted to do something in that field, but I was afraid to

10:02.680 --> 10:08.860
do it because I wasn't well enough educated, even though I'd read hundreds of novels in the field

10:08.860 --> 10:14.060
when I was younger. It didn't seem to get into my bloodstream, but now I think I'm old enough,

10:14.600 --> 10:20.820
and I hope I've learned my lessons, and when the novel comes out people will agree that it's at least

10:20.820 --> 10:25.760
an agreeable competitor in the field. Could he tell us when the novel might be published?

10:26.500 --> 10:32.460
No, I would say about a year from now. It's right up close to being finished. I've been working on

10:32.460 --> 10:39.320
seven or eight years, but you never know. I might finish it all in one week in the next week or two,

10:39.480 --> 10:45.640
and again, I may drag on for another six months. I'm not in charge. I don't make the decisions.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.840
We'll have more next time with Ray Bradbury.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

11:00.840 --> 11:04.640
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:55.220 --> 11:59.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:14.980 --> 12:20.160
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:22.940 --> 12:24.480
And here are your hosts.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.900
This is David Carson.

12:30.180 --> 12:30.740
And Darrell Lane.

12:30.740 --> 12:33.660
Ray Bradbury has always been impossible to categorize.

12:45.660 --> 12:50.940
We asked Bradbury if it ever bothers him to be labeled as a science fiction writer.

13:00.740 --> 13:06.020
There are still some teachers who think that science fiction isn't worth bothering with,

13:06.140 --> 13:11.280
and of course that drives me wild. So their opinion actually irritates me,

13:11.480 --> 13:16.680
because to me it's the central fiction of our time. We are science-oriented,

13:17.360 --> 13:23.100
technologically-oriented people, and there's nothing else to write about except human beings

13:23.640 --> 13:29.580
in some sort of relationship with their ideas, with their machine reads, with their technologies.

13:30.220 --> 13:37.300
All the major problems of our time right now are technological, scientific, moral problems.

13:37.900 --> 13:41.500
What do you do with the automobile? What do you do with nuclear power?

13:41.900 --> 13:48.520
What do you do with cloning? What do you do with DNA experimentation? All these

13:49.100 --> 13:54.980
problems that arise as soon as you invent something new. So all of our major problems right now,

13:54.980 --> 13:59.760
you can't name one that's not connected to a machine somewhere down the line.

14:00.860 --> 14:05.160
What about those hard-headed practical sort of people who have no use for imaginative literature

14:05.160 --> 14:12.020
and call it useless? Well, there's always been backtalk among intellectuals who don't stop and

14:12.020 --> 14:17.860
think what they're saying. It's a very dumb remark. I mean, if you don't have an imagination,

14:18.280 --> 14:24.860
you can't survive. If you don't have some sort of creative instinct in you, how do you think people

14:24.860 --> 14:30.740
survive book and vault? Those who survived survived with their imagination. A lot of them were able

14:30.740 --> 14:37.340
to imagine at times for a little while they were somewhere else. If you're in a jail and people

14:37.340 --> 14:43.340
are dying all around you, you damn well better have the power of imagination so that you can

14:43.340 --> 14:53.420
imagine a future where this will stop or you can imagine a present where you're not there for a

14:53.420 --> 14:59.440
horror that surrounds you. That's a huge thing to be able to do and a lot of people did it. It's

14:59.440 --> 15:08.040
remarkable. It's miraculous. But that's what a human being is, a miraculous animal in the history

15:08.040 --> 15:18.320
of the world who's able to survive. We asked Bradbury what part of his work he'd like to be

15:18.320 --> 15:25.180
remembered for one or two hundred years from now. Oh, I hope that something wicked this way comes.

15:25.460 --> 15:33.240
It's still around. I think it's a universal book. At least I hope it is. It deals with children and

15:33.740 --> 15:38.720
growing up and growing old and getting sick and dying. All the things that happened to all the

15:38.720 --> 15:46.180
people in the history of the world. I hope the book won't age. That it would be long to no special

15:46.180 --> 15:53.360
time but to all times. It's my favorite and I love it because I suppose I'm locked into it with my

15:53.360 --> 15:59.500
father. My father is the hero of the book and I didn't know that at the time I wrote it. One night

15:59.500 --> 16:05.240
I got up and wanted around the house and picked up the book and started to reread it and suddenly

16:05.240 --> 16:11.320
cried out and tears burst from my eyes and I realized that I'd written my father into the book as the

16:11.880 --> 16:18.920
as Mr. Holloway who is the hero of the entire structure of the book. So that's the reason,

16:19.200 --> 16:24.760
one of the reasons why I love it and I hope it'll have a little life after I'm gone.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.780
Something wicked this way comes is indeed a classic in the fantasy horror genre.

16:30.140 --> 16:34.060
And it will be out as a major Hollywood motion picture soon. It's being done by Walt Disney

16:34.060 --> 16:37.700
and Bradbury wrote the script for the screen version. It should be a great one. We'll conclude

16:37.700 --> 16:49.580
our conversation with Ray Bradbury on our next show. This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:49.940 --> 16:54.240
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa

16:54.240 --> 16:55.680
College in Odessa, Texas.

17:46.420 --> 17:50.320
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:06.020 --> 18:11.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.680
And here are your hosts.

18:19.800 --> 18:24.340
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Anyone familiar with the stories of Ray Bradbury will

18:24.340 --> 18:28.160
know that he occasionally writes something in praise of George Bernard Shaw. We asked him why

18:28.160 --> 18:33.680
he thought so much of Shaw. My God, he is of all the writers of our time just about,

18:34.500 --> 18:39.700
at least on the when you think of Irish English literature for the theater.

18:41.040 --> 18:48.360
He is the idea writer of all idea writers. He and G.K. Chesterton and a few others, but he sort of

18:48.360 --> 18:55.240
outraces and outpaces everyone. You name a subject and he just pretty well wrote about it 70 years ago,

18:55.680 --> 19:00.500
100 years ago, 90 years ago. He was interested in theology, he was interested in machinery,

19:01.080 --> 19:03.860
he was interested in the future, he was interested in biology.

19:05.480 --> 19:12.280
He had a far ranging curiosity about mankind and the future of mankind.

19:13.060 --> 19:21.080
So he wrote science fiction as well as doing theological studies and great characters from

19:21.710 --> 19:28.180
history like St. John. I'm so sorry that I never had a chance to get to Europe

19:29.620 --> 19:35.300
while he was still alive. What kinds of books would Bradbury choose to educate children today?

19:36.220 --> 19:42.660
Oh, I would recommend George Bernard Shaw as soon as someone was old enough. I don't think you can

19:42.660 --> 19:50.440
give Shaw to children nor can you give him to kids in high school. But as soon as people get into

19:51.200 --> 19:57.640
to college, then I would bring Shaw out and give them a complete education and ideas and how to

19:57.640 --> 20:05.620
think. And at the lower level, I imagine I would start them out with Jules Verne and H.C. Wells,

20:05.820 --> 20:14.740
the science fiction writers, because kids really are interested in ideas. And it's very playful,

20:15.040 --> 20:22.940
it's wonderful to have an interest in such things. And that's the reason why science fiction,

20:23.500 --> 20:27.840
during the last few years, has been so popular in the high schools and the junior high schools,

20:28.340 --> 20:34.840
that the kids recognize that these fictions deal with very real problems that must be solved.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.820
And you have the fun of playing with those toys inside your head.

20:46.680 --> 20:50.960
Of course, Bradbury is still going full speed writing his own fiction of all sorts.

20:50.960 --> 20:54.660
When we asked him what he was working on at the present time, he mentioned the usual things,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.120
such as poetry, short stories, and novel, even something unusual, a grand opera.

20:59.420 --> 21:02.640
But he's also shaping up something else that should be fascinating to all readers.

21:03.180 --> 21:11.000
Because I've written a sort of autobiographical charting of where I get my ideas and how I

21:11.000 --> 21:19.220
wrote all of my novels. I want to do a sort of book similar to, but certainly not equal to,

21:19.360 --> 21:27.660
the summing up by someone said, Mom. And I think ideas are fascinating. Where do you get a story

21:27.660 --> 21:33.420
idea and what do you do with it? And after all, I've written four or five hundred stories.

21:33.920 --> 21:38.920
So that would make, I think, an interesting book and not a boring one. I don't like to read

21:40.540 --> 21:44.520
autobiographies where they take a thousand pages to go through their childhood.

21:44.900 --> 21:51.660
I'm really not interested in the facts of people's lives. It's a rare person who can write about

21:51.660 --> 21:57.320
their childhood or their sexuality and be interesting and amusing. I don't care

21:58.100 --> 22:03.840
what kind of sex life anyone has had. I don't want to know a thing about George Burnary Shaw

22:03.840 --> 22:08.760
or someone said, Mom or Shakespeare and these others. I have no interest in their sex life.

22:09.160 --> 22:15.960
I have only a huge and pervading interest in their ideas, where they got them and what they did with

22:15.960 --> 22:22.380
them. So that's the kind of book I'm doing. You won't find a gossip in it. You won't find out anything

22:22.380 --> 22:31.700
horrendous about me or anyone else. Just how I stumble over things, pick myself up, dust myself off, and write a poem.

22:39.160 --> 22:43.320
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin

22:43.320 --> 22:47.800
Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:33.860 --> 23:37.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:53.700 --> 23:58.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.120
And here are your hosts.

24:07.320 --> 24:11.980
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon. Jessica Amanda Salmonson has been a professional writer

24:11.980 --> 24:16.180
and editor of fantasy for only a few years, but she's made her influence felt. In 1980,

24:16.320 --> 24:21.220
her first professional work, Amazons, an anthology she edited for Dahl Books, won an award as the

24:21.220 --> 24:26.020
best fantasy anthology of the year. And she's written three novels of heroic fantasy. Two of

24:26.020 --> 24:30.660
them involve a woman samurai warrior named Tomoi Gozen. The first one, entitled Tomoi Gozen,

24:30.760 --> 24:36.040
was published in 1981. The second, called the Golden Naginata, came out in 1982. She also edited

24:36.040 --> 24:41.820
another fantasy anthology in 1982 called Amazons 2, and she'll have much more work coming out in

24:41.820 --> 24:45.680
the future. We spoke with Salmonson recently about her involvement in the field of fantasy.

24:46.100 --> 24:49.560
We wondered if she grew up reading science fiction pulp magazines, as many contemporary

24:49.560 --> 24:57.080
authors have. I never liked the pulp particularly. I liked fairy tales when I was quite little, but

24:57.080 --> 25:03.500
somehow I never thought of them as being suitable for me as a teenage reader or as an adult reader.

25:04.040 --> 25:09.980
It took me a long time to connect and see that fantasy was really suited for adults as well.

25:10.640 --> 25:14.880
I think a lot of people feel that way about fantasy. They start reading science fiction,

25:16.400 --> 25:24.560
perhaps partly because it seems more adult than fantasy. I don't think that's at all true.

25:25.040 --> 25:31.580
Fantasy is a stronger symbolic meaning where science fiction in a lot of ways is a lot more

25:31.580 --> 25:40.700
simplistic. It's worldviews, feeling around for symbols that don't have an ancient heritage or

25:40.700 --> 25:46.680
ancient long existence in our subconscious and our culture. We ask her why fantasy,

25:47.060 --> 25:51.380
particularly heroic fantasy, is so popular these days. Why do people read it?

25:52.040 --> 25:55.160
I don't think you can generalize why people like it.

25:57.660 --> 26:06.140
I think for some people it has a very deep symbolic meaning in their personal daily lives.

26:06.140 --> 26:13.420
Obviously nobody is really a big, tough swords master who can win their way through any problem,

26:14.240 --> 26:21.660
but I think that there is a relationship between these fantasies and the real world that's not

26:21.660 --> 26:28.600
just escapists in that our daily lives are pretty dangerous and we somehow manage to survive and

26:28.600 --> 26:35.780
go to the end of our lives anyway. It's kind of, I suppose, burlesque and extreme,

26:36.460 --> 26:42.120
but the heroic fantasy world is very much like our own world and the dangers we manage to survive

26:42.120 --> 26:48.960
day after day. Also the amount of death and blood and gore that exists in these kinds of novels

26:49.540 --> 26:55.940
is to many people exploitative and grotesque. They don't like it. They don't know why so many

26:55.940 --> 27:01.440
other people do like it and they think very badly of that form of literature because it is so

27:02.000 --> 27:10.060
bloody. But to me, I think there is definitely that exploit to that aspect of it, but I think it's

27:10.060 --> 27:17.480
also, again, symbolic of the transience of our own life. At any moment, if you get smashed to

27:17.480 --> 27:23.180
smithereens in a car crash, life can just end suddenly. Even if you live a long life,

27:23.180 --> 27:29.800
any 80 years or 60 years, this is not a long time and the sudden death and the danger that these

27:29.800 --> 27:39.600
worlds represent is very much like our own world. They're very honest in a way. Finally, we inquired

27:39.600 --> 27:47.360
about the relation of fantasy and fairy tales. In most cases, I think one is the direct outgrowth

27:47.360 --> 27:57.040
of the other. But heroic fantasy probably has its most obvious roots in ancient epics from

27:57.040 --> 28:04.780
Gilgamesh or Jason and the Argonauts, anything like that. It's probably its most obvious roots,

28:05.100 --> 28:13.800
but in the nature of storytelling it's in prose form. It's more related to the fairy tales.

28:20.940 --> 28:25.760
