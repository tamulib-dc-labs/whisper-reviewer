00:09.320 --> 00:13.300
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:29.120 --> 00:34.500
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.380 --> 00:38.860
And here are your hosts.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.800
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.700
Elsprague De Camp's career as a writer of science fiction and fantasy is in its fifth

00:49.700 --> 00:50.040
decade.

00:50.500 --> 00:55.280
He started back in the late 1930s in the pulp magazines and has written continuously ever

00:55.280 --> 00:55.660
since.

00:56.020 --> 00:59.980
His collaborations with Fletcher Pratt occupy an important place in the body of his work.

00:59.980 --> 01:04.600
Among others, these would include the Harold Shea stories, the incomplete enchanter, the

01:04.600 --> 01:06.380
castle of iron, and wall of serpents.

01:06.840 --> 01:11.420
Another of his better known books is Less Darkness Fall, an account of a modern man

01:11.420 --> 01:16.460
who ends up in sixth century Rome trying to keep civilization alive as barbarism sweeps

01:16.460 --> 01:16.760
Europe.

01:17.240 --> 01:21.060
In recent years, the camp has gotten involved in the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard and

01:21.060 --> 01:22.860
has written some rousing sword and sorcery.

01:22.860 --> 01:26.320
We asked the camp to recall for us his beginnings as a writer.

02:02.920 --> 02:12.020
He wrote a couple of stories and I used to come in once twice in New York and I'd stay

02:12.020 --> 02:16.980
at the park and sit up late and plot a couple of these.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.700
I gave him some help with them.

02:20.340 --> 02:29.900
He sent them to a man named Hermane and the editor of the stounding and I saw that he

02:29.900 --> 02:30.300
could do it.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.200
Why can't I?

02:31.700 --> 02:36.520
So having plenty of time and time and I wrote a couple and sent them in.

02:37.140 --> 02:39.340
To my surprise, they were all.

02:40.840 --> 02:45.120
I continued to sell an occasional story to the pulp magazines while working at his regular

02:45.120 --> 02:45.200
store.

02:45.940 --> 02:49.120
Then something happened to change him into a full time writer.

02:50.420 --> 03:03.000
At the end of 1939, one of the editors on the Craze Journal in New York got fired in an

03:03.000 --> 03:04.220
economy purge.

03:17.060 --> 03:30.220
I was in the office and I was in the office and I was in the office and I was in the

03:30.220 --> 03:34.200
and I was in the office and I was in the office and I was in the office and I was in the office

03:34.840 --> 03:41.540
and in freelancing I heard about as much as I had been doing and I could be my own and

03:41.540 --> 03:42.780
work at my own pace.

03:42.980 --> 03:47.000
Work sitting down and working out all my old clothes.

03:48.140 --> 03:53.620
I was a couple of temporary jobs and I was in the second war and I was at the Naval

03:53.620 --> 03:54.160
Reserve.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.080
I've been at it for a sense.

03:57.660 --> 04:00.420
The camp is a professional writer in the truest sense of the word.

04:00.420 --> 04:05.720
He writes almost books on engineering to the definitive history of the Scopes trial,

04:06.440 --> 04:08.200
the biography of Charles Darwin for juveniles.

04:09.260 --> 04:16.920
Of course, remember that although people generally refer to me as the science fiction writer,

04:17.880 --> 04:22.600
the reason is mainly that I made my early reputation in that field.

04:22.600 --> 04:31.560
Actually, fiction is only about half of my output, rest being science, history, biography,

04:32.320 --> 04:33.840
literary, and so on.

04:34.840 --> 04:41.220
And of the fictional half, besides five historical novels that I've written,

04:42.200 --> 04:46.940
about half is science fiction and strict sense, and half is fantasy.

04:46.940 --> 04:52.560
It's only about a quarter of my output is really science fiction and strict sense.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.160
More on El Sprague to Camp next time.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:05.980 --> 05:08.620
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:08.940 --> 05:11.820
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:16.940 --> 05:46.920
The show is about the science fiction,

05:56.840 --> 05:58.200
the science fiction.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show. Stay with us.

06:18.020 --> 06:23.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.920
And here are your ho...

06:32.160 --> 06:33.200
This is Bill Vernon.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.120
And Daryl Lane.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.860
Humor is not common in science fiction and fantasy.

06:37.160 --> 06:37.960
That's understandable.

06:38.540 --> 06:41.960
Traditionally, science fiction is concerned with spaceships, aliens, high adventure,

06:42.460 --> 06:44.820
so much adventure and excitement that humor would seem out of place.

06:44.820 --> 06:48.420
But noted science fiction and fantasy author El Sprague to Camp,

06:48.660 --> 06:51.380
thinks that humor and science fiction can mix very well.

06:53.320 --> 07:00.960
Well, all I can say is that it is true that there aren't a great many humorous stories in that field.

07:01.440 --> 07:06.200
But then of course there aren't a great many humorous stories in any genre of fiction.

07:07.880 --> 07:11.220
Some people, some people do it and some people don't.

07:11.220 --> 07:17.380
Now back in before the first world, the second world war, pardon me, I'm not that old quite yet,

07:17.880 --> 07:25.860
but before the second world war, of the active science fiction writers in the country,

07:26.520 --> 07:31.860
there were only two who were considered humorous science fiction writers.

07:32.140 --> 07:34.960
And I was one and Henry Kutner was the other.

07:35.980 --> 07:45.500
Curiously enough, both Henry and I in our private lives were rather serious solemn fellows.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.800
Much of the Camp science fiction and fantasy is humorous.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.440
In one of the Harold Shea stories collected in the incomplete enchanter,

07:53.860 --> 07:58.180
the Camp delights in constructing episodes that show the incongruity of a 20th century man

07:58.180 --> 08:00.380
trying to survive in the world of Spencer's Fairy Queen.

08:00.740 --> 08:02.180
There's some funny stuff in there.

08:02.180 --> 08:06.360
At one point, Shea and his companions are captured by the blatant beast

08:06.360 --> 08:10.120
who threatens to devour them if they don't entertain them by resetting an epic.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.240
But all the epic Shea starts to recite such as Beowulf, the blatant beast already knows.

08:16.080 --> 08:21.300
In desperation, Shea launches into the ballad of Eskimo Nell, a body drinking song that goes on forever.

08:21.740 --> 08:26.980
In the first place, Shea is mortified by having to recite such a thing in front of his female companion,

08:26.980 --> 08:32.840
but the blatant beast lets his captives go and walks off slowly into the woods shaking its monstrous head.

08:33.200 --> 08:38.040
It's ridiculously incongruous, of course, and it can't maintain that's where the humor comes from.

08:38.760 --> 08:49.080
One of the basic elements of humor in my estimation is the element of surprise or incongruity.

08:49.080 --> 08:59.820
In other words, a derby hat on a London businessman is not funny because they all wear them.

09:00.380 --> 09:05.740
But a derby hat on Trudy, a Caesar is, you see, because it's incongruous.

09:06.040 --> 09:09.700
And that is a very considerable factor in humor.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.260
We asked to camp if there was anything that wouldn't mix well with humor.

09:14.260 --> 09:17.860
Maybe heroic sword and sorcery material like the Conan stories.

09:18.780 --> 09:23.960
Well, you couldn't get the same effect that Robert Howard did with his Conan,

09:24.180 --> 09:29.960
because in Robert Howard's original Conan stories there is hardly any humor.

09:30.580 --> 09:35.080
Only in a couple of stories is there a faint gleam of it here and there.

09:35.080 --> 09:44.280
And when I collaborate with President Day-Colon's stories, let us say Carter,

09:44.520 --> 09:52.840
why he has to call me down now and then because I just have a natural tendency to stick a little humor in now and then.

09:53.060 --> 09:59.600
I've been doing it so long it comes natural, but it should not be done because it spoils the general effect.

09:59.600 --> 10:09.140
Now, as for my own stories in that genre, well, I have no hesitation about putting in humor in and putting humor in.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.620
And my heroes are in general not supermen.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.320
They have to be pretty able fellows, but I try to make them realistic.

10:16.420 --> 10:21.680
That is with the usual assortment of virtues and vices and strengths and weaknesses.

10:22.920 --> 10:27.560
Because that's the kind of character that I personally find it easier to believe in when I read it.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.680
Humor takes many forms in the camp's work.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.420
He can use gentle satire, for instance, in a book like The Great Fetish.

10:34.720 --> 10:40.740
And don't forget his collection of humorous bar room tall tales done with Fletcher Pratt, tales from Gavagan's Bar.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.500
We're seeing more humor in science fiction today.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.680
I suspect L. Sprague the Camp's influence is being felt.

10:47.700 --> 10:50.040
More next time on L. Sprague the Camp.

10:57.560 --> 11:02.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

11:02.900 --> 11:06.080
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.080
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

11:57.320 --> 11:57.540
So, let's get started.

11:57.540 --> 11:58.400
So, stay with us.

12:14.360 --> 12:19.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.140
And here are your hosts.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.340
This is Daryl Lane.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.220
And Bill Vernon.

12:31.700 --> 12:37.100
One of the most successful collaborations in the field of science fantasy was the team of Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague the Camp.

12:37.400 --> 12:43.120
During the late 30s and through the 40s, they wrote a series of humorous stories about a young man named Harold Shea.

12:43.740 --> 12:48.080
Shea theorizes that there are an infinite number of worlds that exist all around us.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.020
And he finds a way to get to them using symbolic logic.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.440
He visits a number of fantastic places.

12:53.900 --> 12:57.260
The world of Norse mythology, for instance, and the world of Spencer's Fairy Queen.

12:57.900 --> 13:03.960
Sprague the Camp says that a friend named John Clark introduced him to Fletcher Pratt in the late 1930s.

13:05.020 --> 13:11.740
Fletcher was, at that time, an established and active writer, and I was a struggling young pro, you might say.

13:13.420 --> 13:19.000
So, John said to me, hey, Fletcher says he would like to see you. He has an idea for some stories.

13:19.660 --> 13:37.400
So I went around to Fletcher's and he proposed that he and I collaborate on a series of stories based upon this far-out theory that you can slip into any universe you want to by manipulating the symbols of symbolic logic.

13:37.600 --> 13:42.440
I had been studying symbolic logic a little with all its cuter symbols and things.

13:43.900 --> 13:50.960
So, okay, we went to it. And that is how the Five Herald Shea Stories originated.

13:51.840 --> 13:57.060
The Shea Stories appeared in pulp magazines beginning in 1940. They were later collected in three books.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.600
The Incomplete Enchanter, The Castle of Iron, and Wall of Serpents.

14:01.040 --> 14:09.580
The alternate universe as Shea enters are fantasy worlds where magic works, but they're all consistent logical places once you accept their magical framework.

14:09.580 --> 14:17.340
Right. Shea finds out that matches or guns just don't operate in these worlds. The camp says that such consistency is important to fantasy.

14:18.220 --> 14:33.780
Both Fletcher and I had long since agreed that, right from the start, that the most effective is that in writing fantasy, you have to be even more careful about internal consistency than you do in writing a realistic story.

14:33.780 --> 14:44.420
Because the reader's credulity is already stretched like a rubber band, you see, and if you put extra strain on it by having some obvious contradiction, it's going to snap.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.120
At that point, you'll probably stop reading.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.520
The camp explains how he and Pratt came up with their alternate worlds.

14:53.160 --> 15:02.420
Actually, I've always been a very heavy reader. I was reading Darwin's Origin of Species through at the age of seven, you know, and things like that.

15:02.420 --> 15:18.800
And I had a pretty good historical and mythological knowledge, but actually for the roaring trumpet, Fletcher knew a good deal more about that than I because he was an enthusiast for the Northern thing, as William Morris called it,

15:19.020 --> 15:25.980
and belonged to a group that got together in Boston and read Icelandic sagas to each other in the original.

15:28.220 --> 15:33.800
Well, therefore, he was way ahead of me in the matter of Norse mythology.

15:34.060 --> 15:44.720
Then the second story was laid in the world of Spencer's Fairy Queen, and I had never read the Fairy Queen, so I sat down and beautifully plowed right through it.

15:45.220 --> 15:54.840
I never did have quite the enthusiasm for it. That Fletcher did. I found it pretty tedious for long stretches, but nevertheless, he thought highly of it.

15:54.840 --> 16:11.160
And he went through it. And then for the third one, why we... I knew something about Oriostos Orlando Frioso, although I'd never read it through, but it wasn't very difficult to get hold of a set and read him.

16:12.060 --> 16:25.720
And that furnished the material layer. Well, then we... After the Second World War, we sent Harold to the world of the Finnish Kalevala,

16:26.440 --> 16:32.480
and that was simply a matter of getting the Everyman's Library edition and reading through that and taking notes.

16:33.360 --> 16:41.980
And we finally had him end up where he'd wanted to go all along, which is in the mythological Ireland of Kuhullen and Queen Maeve.

16:42.600 --> 16:49.440
And I already knew a fair amount about that, but I read up some more, so we got the stories.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.980
Next time we'll have more, and I'll sprake the camp.

17:00.500 --> 17:10.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
