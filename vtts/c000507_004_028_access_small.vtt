WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:05.180
Okay, we have tape throwing on this end. Let's start out. How much time do we have first?

00:05.620 --> 00:06.600
As much as you want.

00:06.900 --> 00:07.800
Oh wow, okay.

00:07.940 --> 00:10.900
We've got a rough cut at four o'clock, so we've got 55 minutes.

00:11.240 --> 00:17.740
Oh, that should be plenty of time. First, how did this project get started?

00:19.100 --> 00:24.820
The project got started. I was doing a half-hour situation comedy two years ago.

00:24.820 --> 00:30.760
I did the first four hours of this, the first two hours, first four episodes of the sitcom,

00:32.100 --> 00:37.600
and was fired by Warner Brothers after the show became a hit in the grand show business tradition.

00:38.220 --> 00:43.620
So I went surfing and I was sitting on the beach the next day. It was just about two years ago.

00:45.840 --> 00:52.680
And decided to write a show that if it ever got on the air, I would watch it. That was the basis of it.

00:52.680 --> 00:58.460
That I wanted to do something that I would watch, that I thought would be fun to see.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.760
And I started to kick around various elements of different things that I had liked,

01:04.840 --> 01:09.820
and different things that appealed to me, and that I was interested in.

01:10.260 --> 01:18.640
And it was a combination of things from the movie Butch and Sundance, and Star Wars, and Raiders, which were all very hot.

01:18.640 --> 01:27.320
And my kids were heavily into Dungeons and Dragons, and video games, stuff like that.

01:27.940 --> 01:38.900
And I thought of doing a medieval version, something that looked medieval, a medieval version of Butch and Sundance, essentially.

01:39.700 --> 01:49.800
That is characters who are set in a, what appears to be an historical setting, who have contemporary sensibilities.

01:50.600 --> 02:01.860
And that was the beginning of it. That was the first germ of what became Greystone's Odyssey, which was the name of the show until last fall.

02:01.860 --> 02:10.400
And I took these various notions over to a friend of mine at CBS, who was in charge of ordering scripts, and he responded to it right away.

02:11.420 --> 02:23.900
What I did was then started to create a world. I created a planet called Camerrand, and set all the action of this show on the continent of Apparance.

02:23.900 --> 02:33.800
Now, from my way of thinking, for all my staff, and for everybody who's written it, the planet of Camerrand is Earth, 500 million years in the future.

02:34.560 --> 02:44.100
Post-technology, and it has returned to, through an evolutionary process, what we know of as historically as the medieval times.

02:44.100 --> 02:59.160
But with twist, there are a lot of mutants. There is holdover technology, which is controlled by the wizards, who have access to the book, which is the source of knowledge and power.

03:01.220 --> 03:13.840
And that's basically what the framework is. Now, on the continent of Apparance, within that framework, there is a war taking place between the forces of the north and the forces of the south.

03:13.840 --> 03:24.760
The forces of the north being represented by Prince Dirk Blackpool, the bad guy, and the forces of the south being represented by Prince Eric Greystone. That's essentially what happened.

03:30.700 --> 03:33.880
Okay. How far have you gotten into production?

03:36.540 --> 03:50.200
We shot a pilot last year. CBS saw that and ordered seven additional episodes. I completed filming the eighth episode about two weeks ago, and we're in post-production now.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.340
Okay, then it's pretty well done. Do you have any projected air date?

03:55.340 --> 04:01.060
We will go on the air Saturday, March the fifth at eight o'clock on CBS.

04:04.040 --> 04:22.800
Okay. I thought, I saw something. CBS runs the gizmos where they say, you know, here's what's coming next month. And I thought I saw something that dealt with your program on there, but it was like a two-second micro blitz of a guy with a sword that was glowing, and he whooped around and then it was off.

04:22.800 --> 04:46.460
It's amazing that you actually saw that. I saw it too. I was skiing last week. I had no idea they were going to do that. There are two little clips, probably, it's almost subliminal, from an episode called The Rescue, where the wizard vector, well, this shows everything is so complicated.

04:46.460 --> 05:06.040
Prince Eric Greystone is hanging dangling at the end of a chain over a slime pit, which contains a slime monster. And the wizard vector sends this laser beam to the top of the chain, which heats the chain, and the heat begins to descend until it touches his hands, and he has to let go and fall into the pit.

05:06.840 --> 05:14.520
You saw the casting of that beam and the slow motion shot of Greystone falling towards the water.

05:16.920 --> 05:27.560
I knew it wasn't from any show that I had seen previously, and I knew it wasn't a cut from Star Wars, which CBS is hoping to show, so I knew it probably had to be your show.

05:27.560 --> 05:38.220
Well, that's very observant of you. This show does not look like anything you have ever seen on television. I guarantee you that it is very, very different. It's quite an adventure.

05:38.940 --> 05:42.140
Why don't you go into explaining a little bit of what the differences are?

05:43.540 --> 05:56.620
Well, everything is different. First of all, it breaks all the rules. You're not supposed to do period pieces on television. They don't work. Well, this isn't really a period piece, but it looks like one when you first see it.

05:57.620 --> 06:14.080
It's heavily costumed. The show deals with fantasy, which outside of Star Trek has not been very successful. There's a lot of science fiction overtones to it.

06:18.020 --> 06:30.740
It's episodic, but it's also a serial in the way that mash is. The war is the overlying thing, overriding thing, so each episode doesn't wrap up a problem neatly.

06:31.540 --> 06:49.700
It is shot with fog filters and half corals, which gives it a very storybook look. Nothing else on television does that. Everything about it is different. It's very hard to explain. There's humor in it, and yet people die.

06:49.700 --> 06:59.900
There are no jokes, but it's very funny. I can't think of anything that even compares to it.

07:01.620 --> 07:07.780
Did I read correctly that you made some references to mash? Are there some of the writers from mash working on the show?

07:07.780 --> 07:20.780
I produced mash in 1975-76 along with Bert Metcalf and Alan Katz, and I did 26 episodes of it. Nobody else on my staff worked on mash.

07:21.860 --> 07:32.160
That's where I remember seeing your name. I'm a big mash fan. You mentioned something about the effects. Does the show have quite a bit of a special effect on it then?

07:32.160 --> 07:53.900
Yeah. One of the episodes, I'm just looking at it today, called the Kidnap, has a special effect in every scene. It's an enormous amount of special effects, matworks, beam splitters, opticals, rotoscoping, a lot of it. It's a very, very expensive endeavor.

07:54.820 --> 08:01.920
I was just thinking, it must be pretty expensive to produce then.

08:02.740 --> 08:15.380
It's enormously expensive. It's the most expensive series that CBS has ever commissioned. It's a gamble. They should be commended for taking this gamble.

08:15.380 --> 08:24.460
For all the people who are fantasy and science fiction fans, they should write a thank you about the CBS because I don't know anybody else in television who would have attempted this.

08:26.680 --> 08:42.380
Yeah, ABC had a lot of hopes for Battlesmart Galactica, if you remember when that came on. The effects were fantastic, but the writing just kind of fell off and the show didn't hold up from the writing end of it.

08:42.380 --> 08:57.180
Yeah, you've got to start with solid scripts, solid characters, and hope that people respond to that first because as far as dazzling people with special effects, you go to the movies and you're going to see $20 million special effects.

08:57.840 --> 09:11.740
So we're not going to show anything that hasn't been seen before in films, but we have characters that no one's ever seen before in an interesting situation, I think. The classic situation. It's good against evil.

09:13.960 --> 09:21.580
Yeah, I'm a big fan of fantasy myself. Read a lot. Play Dungeons and Dragons. Oh, her.

09:26.120 --> 09:31.600
But what is the market that you're aiming at?

09:33.380 --> 09:40.640
George Lucas once said that Star Wars was designed for kids or anybody who's ever been one. You know, I think that's the market that I want.

09:42.200 --> 09:49.880
They're putting it on at eight o'clock, so it's a highly visual show, so hopefully it'll attract a young audience.

09:49.880 --> 09:59.680
But I think young adults and even not so young adults will respond to it because it can be viewed on different levels.

10:00.740 --> 10:09.480
When you have as broad a canvas as we have, you have the possibility, the opportunity to do parables.

10:10.720 --> 10:27.120
And everything is structured on various levels. You can interpret the stories, the lines on a sophisticated adult level, or you can just go straight ahead with the story and look at the monsters and the power sorts.

10:30.200 --> 10:37.860
I think it will appeal to a lot of people or it will appeal to no one. This show is either a rocket or a bomb. One or the other. It's not in between.

10:37.860 --> 10:39.620
I happen to like it.

10:40.880 --> 10:52.720
Okay. Yeah, I have, if I can express my own personal opinion here, I really have a hope for a fantasy or science fiction show.

10:53.340 --> 11:00.060
You know, a really good one to come on and they seem to have been lacking. Do you have any opinions as to why that might be?

11:00.060 --> 11:08.760
Yeah, everything out here is done by committee. Once you start with an idea, you can have a pure idea, a great idea.

11:09.260 --> 11:21.000
And you take it to one of the networks and you pitch it to a person at a network and that person makes changes along with his assistants and they all make changes because it's their money in the end.

11:21.000 --> 11:30.680
And then his boss will make changes and then his boss will make changes and then you go into, if you're working with a studio like I am, the studio will request changes.

11:32.420 --> 11:46.300
Actors then request changes. Directors make changes and it never stops. There's always groups of people who have input and the net effect is you end up with a watered down property.

11:46.300 --> 11:51.440
You know, I see things on the air and I say, my God, it's a great idea but the execution is so bad.

11:52.200 --> 12:02.460
And then I remember how this town works and realize why very few things come through with clarity and purity and it's because of interference.

12:03.480 --> 12:15.360
With Wizards and Warriors, I was extraordinarily fortunate in the gentleman at CVS that I first told the idea to go ahead within 30 seconds.

12:15.520 --> 12:25.880
It was an incredible meeting and all his assistants were dumbfounded. He understood it and he has shepherded the project.

12:25.880 --> 12:30.000
He shares the vision of the project with me. His name is Kimmel Masters, incidentally.

12:30.500 --> 12:41.020
And he has shepherded it through all this complicated process of writing and making pilots and then writing episodes and making them and all the pitfalls have been avoided.

12:41.880 --> 12:48.220
The show is exactly as I conceived it initially that day on the beach, maybe better.

12:50.160 --> 12:56.540
And that's the first time I've ever experienced that sort of thing in this business.

12:59.040 --> 13:07.820
Yeah, I know how difficult that must have been because of the convoluted process that things get from the idea stage to the actual finished product.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.480
We managed to avoid all of it.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.260
All right.

13:17.380 --> 13:22.120
Did I understand you that you do some or a lot of the writing?

13:22.820 --> 13:26.640
I wrote, let's see, I wrote four of the eight shows.

13:27.460 --> 13:30.980
The co-executive producer, Judith Allison, wrote one.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.060
A fellow named Bill Richmond wrote two of them.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.920
A fellow named Robert Earl wrote one.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.340
And those are the eight that are going out of here.

13:42.300 --> 13:47.100
Okay. Could you give me a brief rundown of how the script writing process goes?

13:48.760 --> 13:49.280
Yes.

13:51.540 --> 13:57.760
When we're working in production and I have a staff, as I did starting last July,

13:58.880 --> 14:04.980
there's me, Judith Allison, Bill Richmond, Robert Earl, and another wonderful writer named Paul Edwards.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.620
We all get in a room and sit down and start to talk about stories, possible stories.

14:11.420 --> 14:17.620
And when we seize on an idea that everybody agrees on, we start to work out the story, break it down into four acts,

14:19.080 --> 14:21.500
and then take one scene at a time.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.900
The first scene is this, the second scene is this, so on and so forth.

14:23.900 --> 14:28.020
The end of the first act is this, all the way through it until we have a completed story.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.080
And somebody takes notes.

14:30.600 --> 14:37.820
I get those notes, I get on the phone with the network, in this case CBS, and tell them the story.

14:38.280 --> 14:45.140
If they accept the story, we then go ahead to first draft, which is one individual writer will go ahead and write a complete first draft.

14:46.100 --> 14:50.720
We then take the first draft and in-house sit down and read it out loud.

14:51.240 --> 14:59.940
We split up the parts, everybody will play a character, and we actually do the play, as it were, in my office here.

15:01.040 --> 15:07.820
That's a system that Gene Reynolds instituted and maybe initiated on MASH, and I found it to be very successful,

15:07.820 --> 15:11.720
because then you're not hearing these lines for the first time and you don't have an actor say,

15:11.780 --> 15:14.840
my god, I can't say that, it's awful, because you've already said it.

15:15.620 --> 15:17.840
The answer can always be, well, I can say it if you can.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.520
And we do it that way.

15:20.640 --> 15:31.180
And the result of that meeting becomes the second draft, which is then sent to the network for their comments, suggested changes,

15:32.340 --> 15:39.260
and standards and practices, obviously, will take out anything that they find objectionable, or ask us to take it out.

15:39.740 --> 15:40.880
A lot of arguments there.

15:41.620 --> 15:44.600
And that's basically how it works when you're in production.

15:48.140 --> 15:51.260
Yeah, okay, I was tremendously interested in that myself.

15:54.960 --> 16:01.300
Give me a little bit of rundown on who's in the show, who's acting, what part, and stuff like that.

16:01.840 --> 16:09.040
Okay, Prince Eric Greystone is played by Jeff Conaway, who was on Taxi.

16:09.760 --> 16:14.140
I think that's probably what he's best known for, and he was also in Greece.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.000
He's done a whole bunch of stuff.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.060
Looks like a prince.

16:18.800 --> 16:27.240
His sidekick is a guy named Walter Okowitz, who had a series called The Last Resort a few years back.

16:27.740 --> 16:29.360
Very funny, very talented guy.

16:30.520 --> 16:38.220
Greystone's brother, Justin Greystone, is played by a guy named Jay Kerr, who is from Texas, relative newcomer.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.880
He's also a regular on The Young and the Restless, I think.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.420
Yeah, The Young and the Restless.

16:45.340 --> 16:46.940
Those are the good guys.

16:47.260 --> 16:57.040
Also on the good guy's side is the wizard Trey Quill, who's played by an actor named Ian Wolfe, who is probably the oldest living man on Earth.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.160
I'm not sure how old Ian is.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.500
Somewhere around 100.

17:03.800 --> 17:13.700
The King Baldor, who's the King of the threatened country in the South, is played by Tom Hill, and his wife Queen Latinia is played by Julie Payne.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.800
And the Princess Ariel is played by Julia Duffy.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.480
She's absolutely fabulous. You're going to love her.

17:21.220 --> 17:23.220
She was just in the blue and the gray.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.440
She was the romantic lead for Stacey Keach in that.

17:27.440 --> 17:38.200
On the bad guy's side, Prince Blackpool is played by an actor named Duncan Regare, who is going to be on the cover of People Magazine in April.

17:39.260 --> 17:48.020
Basically, the character of Prince Dirk Blackpool is, my concept was to write Darth Vader and to cast an extremely good looking guy.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.900
And the combination is devastating.

17:51.900 --> 18:00.040
The evil wizard Vector is played by Clive Reville and the witch Bethel is played by Randy Brooks.

18:00.860 --> 18:11.880
And there's another Blackpool brother, Jeffrey Blackpool, who appears occasionally is played by Tim Dunnigan, who was on a show last night called The A-Team, a movie that was on NBC.

18:12.960 --> 18:13.960
And that's the cast.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.040
Yeah, I saw A-Team last night. Was he the one they called Face?

18:19.040 --> 18:19.920
That's him.

18:20.420 --> 18:24.660
Yes, in fact, I was going to remark a while ago, but I didn't want to sidetrack what we were doing.

18:26.220 --> 18:32.220
Camille got by the closest word I've ever heard to getting, he said, mudsucker.

18:33.080 --> 18:33.300
Yeah.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.140
I've never heard anybody get closer.

18:38.820 --> 18:40.440
That's a great game we play out here.

18:40.700 --> 18:41.260
I love it.

18:41.820 --> 18:49.560
I think the worst pun I ever heard was Jim Henson's thing he's doing on Home Box Office.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.840
The lead character's name is Traveling Matt.

18:54.420 --> 18:56.160
That's got to be the worst pun I've heard.

18:56.680 --> 18:57.860
Oh, I've heard words for that.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.980
What do you think are the possibilities for a run on the show?

19:04.920 --> 19:06.580
Like I said, it's a rocket or a bomb.

19:06.880 --> 19:07.320
I don't know.

19:09.200 --> 19:14.400
It's very different. It's a unique, you know, it's all the things that people say television isn't.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.880
I don't know if anybody's going to like it.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.680
You know, you get tunnel vision, at least I do.

19:18.780 --> 19:24.200
When I get involved in a project this deeply, it's been two years now, you lose objectivity.

19:24.600 --> 19:31.280
And the best you can do is cling to your initial idea and the excitement that that idea generated

19:31.280 --> 19:34.940
and try and stay true to that, whether or not anybody else will like it.

19:34.940 --> 19:39.400
I absolutely don't know. But if they do, it'll be in large numbers.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.700
But if they don't, you'll never hear of me again.

19:44.780 --> 19:45.560
That's not true.

19:47.880 --> 19:48.740
Let's see.

19:50.540 --> 19:53.500
I think I've basically covered all the questions that I wrote down here.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.140
Is there anything else that you would have to say about it?

20:00.840 --> 20:10.320
I don't know. You know, it's really even difficult for me to talk about this show because it is an amalgam of so many different things.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.320
It has become something of its own, you know.

20:12.900 --> 20:18.720
It's very exciting. It's fun and it's fast.

20:22.740 --> 20:24.580
I just hope a lot of people watch it.

20:26.060 --> 20:32.500
Okay, well, I can tell you that I'll be glued to my tube with my video tape recorder going March the 5th.

20:32.500 --> 20:36.440
So will I. You'll get to see it a couple hours before I do though.

20:36.780 --> 20:39.040
Oh yeah, that's right. I was hitting you all there.

20:39.380 --> 20:42.140
But you will have seen it previous to that, I'm sure, a few times.

20:43.160 --> 20:48.220
Yeah, I've seen one of the shows 106 times yesterday.

20:50.420 --> 20:59.200
The pilot, which we, you know, in the pilot it was a completed story, a non-completed story.

20:59.260 --> 21:03.440
We had an open ending on it as to whether or not the princess was rescued.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.020
That's what makes for good pilots. People want to see the next one.

21:07.540 --> 21:11.940
So we had to go back and reshoot the end of it so we would have a complete episode.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.540
And it seems like I've been working on that one forever.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.300
I mean, I wrote it two years ago and I'm still working on it.

21:19.420 --> 21:21.600
As a matter of fact, we're still going to continue to work on it.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.480
I'm doing some voiceover work on it next week.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.580
I start to live with these things. They become a part of your life.

21:29.540 --> 21:38.080
One of the challenges, one thing that I found interesting in writing all these episodes was one of these self-imposed rules.

21:38.080 --> 21:47.000
I wanted the heroes at every act break, which is four times an hour, to be in a situation where they could not possibly survive.

21:48.060 --> 21:51.340
And then after the act break, find a way to have them survive.

21:51.860 --> 21:55.740
And we've managed to do that, but it's, I'll tell you, that's a challenge.

21:56.320 --> 22:03.200
You start out trying to think of a situation that somebody cannot get out of and then work backwards.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.780
That was a major time consumer.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.360
The cliffhanger.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.420
Yes, indeed. The old cliffhanger.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.660
You guys run into a lot of problems.

22:17.640 --> 22:22.720
There are snake-faced people, not only the wizards, but all these mutants and monsters running around.

22:22.980 --> 22:26.120
It's a rough life. It came our end.

22:27.900 --> 22:28.800
Sounds like it.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.840
I wonder if they need any special effects to get out of the hole.

22:38.080 --> 22:46.480
When the show hits the air, you know how the, I can't think of a good way to ask this one.

22:47.020 --> 22:55.940
When the show becomes popular, and it hits the air and people go, oh wow, you know this new show is on, it's called this fantasy fantastic stuff on it.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.860
What do you think the general public is going to gravitate toward first?

23:01.260 --> 23:03.220
The people. No question about it.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.800
In television, you're selling people. That's what it is.

23:09.480 --> 23:14.740
That's why certain actors endure, you know, because they're comfortable to have in your living room.

23:15.440 --> 23:23.900
There are certain television personalities, if you will, like Bill Bixby and James Garner and those people who go from one hit series to another.

23:25.820 --> 23:28.560
That's the first thing that people respond to is the people.

23:30.600 --> 23:34.840
And we have a varied and interesting group.

23:37.520 --> 23:42.180
After about it, it's the writing. It's a question of the stories. Are the stories in grossing? Do they hold your attention?

23:42.800 --> 23:45.860
Do you get bored? Do you go to sleep? Do you go to the refrigerator or the bathroom?

23:47.140 --> 23:50.140
You have to be able to hold people and entertain them.

23:51.420 --> 23:55.500
That's what this is all about. You know, it's a giant game, but we're trying to entertain people.

23:57.260 --> 23:58.300
Starting with me.

24:03.740 --> 24:04.620
Very good.

24:06.040 --> 24:06.800
All right.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.660
So this is probably a pretty dumb question, but I can ask it anyway.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.740
How do you know when you've got a good story idea?

24:22.340 --> 24:32.520
Well, it fulfills certain requirements. You know it when you hear it is all I can tell you after doing this for 14 years.

24:33.620 --> 24:42.240
This year, it's just, it's a story that grabs your attention. You start with one line, usually, with one sentence.

24:42.240 --> 24:50.920
You know, what if there was a nuclear device planted in the castle? That's one of the scripts that we did.

24:52.180 --> 25:04.980
We started with basic sentence and that was interesting to me that you could have some huge explosive device hidden in the good guy's castle that they can't find.

25:05.980 --> 25:15.540
And the ramifications of that, you know, that can't be turned off. You can't stop it unless you get this key that's in a place that's filled where one false move is certain death.

25:16.380 --> 25:20.740
So the heroes obviously have to go and get the key and then get back in time to shut the thing off.

25:22.560 --> 25:26.680
You just know it. I mean, that was instantly a story that I wanted to do.

25:26.680 --> 25:38.820
I think a good story idea begs the question, what happens then? That's when you know you have a good story.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.860
Okay, very good. Very interesting.

25:57.160 --> 26:04.400
I think I pretty well got it covered. I really wish you luck on your project and everything.

26:06.020 --> 26:13.220
And one of these days, I hope to get out there and do something or work for somebody one of these days if I can ever figure out how to do it.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.300
Come on out, give me a call.

26:15.880 --> 26:25.520
Okay, I'll do that. Listen, give me an address where I can send you a copy of the tape or send you a copy of the finished tape as it goes on there so you can hear what it sounds like.

26:25.520 --> 26:33.220
Okay, well you can just send it to the Burbank Studios in Burbank. It's 4,000 Warner Boulevard.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.400
4,000 Warner Boulevard. Okay.

26:35.780 --> 26:37.440
Burbank, California, it'll get to me.

26:37.660 --> 26:38.560
Okay, I'll do that.

26:39.040 --> 26:39.540
All right, David.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.180
Listen, sir, appreciate your time very much.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.060
Nice talking to you.

26:42.140 --> 26:42.640
Okay, bye-bye.
