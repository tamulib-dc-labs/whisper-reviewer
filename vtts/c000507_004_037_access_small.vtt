00:11.360 --> 00:18.580
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.580 --> 00:20.820
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.360
This is David Cruz and David Carson.

00:31.780 --> 00:34.240
The subject of this program is science fantasy.

00:35.560 --> 00:40.420
We won't be able to define that term to everyone's satisfaction. In fact, we won't even try to

00:40.420 --> 00:45.480
define it. But we can provide some elements or qualities that would need to be present in a

00:45.480 --> 00:50.800
work for it to be called science fantasy. Let's consider it first according to the implications

00:50.800 --> 00:55.180
of the term itself, a combination of science and fantasy.

00:55.960 --> 01:01.220
For purposes of delineation, consider first a book of very hard science fiction such as

01:01.220 --> 01:08.740
Tau Zero or Hal Clemett's Mission of Gravity that include elements of strict science extrapolation

01:08.740 --> 01:11.640
from well-known physics and astronomy.

01:12.340 --> 01:18.840
Yes, Tau Zero being based on relativity and the time compression and traveling at a very fast speed.

01:19.160 --> 01:27.000
And Mission of Gravity taking place on a planet where there is varying gravity due to a massive

01:27.000 --> 01:31.520
gravity of the planet, but it has a rapid spin allowing for greater gravitation at the poles,

01:31.700 --> 01:33.220
but a lesser gravitation at the equator.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.620
Both books, of course, have fascinating plots to them. They're very interesting to read.

01:40.380 --> 01:47.380
But neither book would work if it weren't for the science behind them. Both are very hard in their

01:47.380 --> 01:48.220
physical sciences.

01:49.140 --> 01:53.680
And although some readers might consider them fantastic, they are really not a part of that

01:53.680 --> 02:01.240
genre known as fantasy. Everything in those books is a strict extrapolation from well-known physics.

02:01.960 --> 02:06.400
On the other end of the scale, we might consider some books that are truly fantasy books.

02:06.960 --> 02:13.040
Things like The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. This is a strict fantasy. There's no science

02:13.040 --> 02:20.520
involved. It's all magic and sorcery. Creatures that are not anything known to humans today.

02:21.580 --> 02:28.080
The story is fantasy in its truest sense. There's no science fiction elements at all.

02:28.740 --> 02:33.200
And the same as in Conan the Barbarian series by Robert E. Howard.

02:33.780 --> 02:39.300
The hero is a brash barbarian who roamed the earth during the Hyborian Age.

02:39.920 --> 02:46.420
There's no science to the book at all. There's some remnants of factual history,

02:46.820 --> 02:48.220
but it's mostly just fantasy.

02:48.980 --> 02:53.860
And in between these two extremes, I guess you could call them the hard science and the pure fantasy.

02:55.060 --> 03:00.880
That's where science fantasy would exist. And I think we might look at almost the

03:00.880 --> 03:05.300
the epitome of science fantasy, a book by Rogers Alasney called Jack of Shadows.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.680
And the reason that's a good example of the genre we're considering on our show today

03:10.380 --> 03:17.340
is that it's exactly half science and half fantasy. The world that Jack lives on is,

03:17.540 --> 03:23.240
it doesn't rotate. It has one light side and one dark side. On the dark side, magic works.

03:24.980 --> 03:32.040
People have special powers that are pure wizardry, pure fantasy. But on the light side,

03:32.820 --> 03:37.300
the inhabitants have to go by the rules that we understand, the rules of science. Magic doesn't

03:37.300 --> 03:42.480
work. And by the fact the world does not rotate, these haves never meet, they never change.

03:42.700 --> 03:46.380
Although it's possible for inhabitants of either side to travel to the other side.

03:47.100 --> 03:54.000
This is brought into vivid focus when Jack, a character living on the dark side, a magical being

03:54.620 --> 03:59.900
travels to the light side. And in order to find some information which he has to extract from a

03:59.900 --> 04:05.660
computer, when the reader is reading this jump from the dark side to the light side, it's almost

04:05.660 --> 04:11.220
as if he's reading a different book. The change is so abrupt. Yes, it's an extremely abrupt

04:11.220 --> 04:19.740
transition from the dark side to the light. On the dark side, Zalazny is very skilled at relating

04:20.500 --> 04:27.720
strange creatures, alien environments. And you get used to a totally fantastic book with creatures

04:27.720 --> 04:32.600
you've never seen before, with heroic actions, with magic. And all of a sudden you're in a world

04:32.600 --> 04:37.620
where computers work, where Jack has got a job at university. Now he's there for a purpose,

04:37.620 --> 04:41.580
as you said, to gain information from the computer. But it's almost like you're reading a different

04:41.580 --> 04:47.600
book when you go from one half of the world of the world to the other. It's also, I think,

04:47.920 --> 04:53.820
the epitome of the attraction of this type of book when Jack uses some of his magical powers

04:53.820 --> 05:00.940
within the scientific background of the light side. And it's a lot of fun because all of a

05:00.940 --> 05:05.360
sudden you're introducing these fantastic elements into a logical and orderly scene.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.400
This is, I think, the attraction of the science fantasy for most people.

05:10.220 --> 05:13.460
It could be said to be sort of a wish fulfillment, couldn't it?

05:14.300 --> 05:20.320
I'd go along with that. I think it is. Everybody wants, especially as a child, as you're growing

05:20.320 --> 05:26.420
up, you want magic to work. And at least in some degree, we still retain that wish as we get older.

05:27.200 --> 05:34.360
This sort of brings that out. It lets you let magic work in your mind, at least, for a while.

05:35.740 --> 05:40.660
But Jack has a serious quest in that book. He's different than almost any other, well,

05:40.780 --> 05:45.900
he's different than any other dark sider in that he's restless. He wants answers to certain

05:45.900 --> 05:51.300
questions. And he sets out on a quest, well, it happens to be a quest of vengeance, but along

05:51.300 --> 05:58.040
the way, he has it elevated to another level of seriousness, whereby he travels to the center

05:58.040 --> 06:04.040
of the earth and destroys the huge machine which keeps the earth from spinning, which keeps one

06:04.040 --> 06:10.260
half in light and one half in darkness. And his intention in doing that is to, well, to destroy

06:10.260 --> 06:18.000
the world as it is. Art could be to create the world as he thinks it ought to be. Good point,

06:18.200 --> 06:24.000
because when he stops that machine, what he does is start the world spinning. And there's a series

06:24.000 --> 06:31.180
of light and dark, you know, day and night. And Jack realizes that what he's done is to blend magic

06:31.180 --> 06:36.600
and science. He says that magic will still belong to the dark, you know, to nighttime, whereas

06:36.600 --> 06:43.040
science will be in the light. It's sort of symbolic, I guess. Yes, doesn't Jack have a problem in

06:43.040 --> 06:49.000
determining which is real, the magic or the science in some part of that novel? Yeah, he asks one of

06:49.000 --> 06:56.400
his friends on the dark side called Morningstar, who is an amazing giant-like creature, non-human,

06:56.400 --> 07:01.320
totally. But he's very wise and he seems to have answers to most things. But Jack asks him,

07:01.480 --> 07:05.240
which is the correct way to be? Or which is the correct side to live on? Which is real?

07:05.760 --> 07:10.780
You know, the light side or the dark side? Science or magic? Morningstar simply tells him

07:10.780 --> 07:16.260
that both are correct. It depends on which way you look at it. And I think, therefore, the book is

07:16.260 --> 07:23.280
partly dealing with the two ways of approaching reality. Zalazny might be saying that you have

07:23.280 --> 07:30.280
to have some of both in order to be, well, I guess to have a balanced view on reality and on life.

07:30.640 --> 07:36.260
And in that sense, I think it's a symbolic book. Zalazny has also written a series of books based

07:36.260 --> 07:43.680
on alternate worlds called The Chronicles of Amber. This is a series of five novels, at least five so

07:43.680 --> 07:49.420
far. They are The Nine Princes in Amber, The Guns of Abelon, The Sign of the Unicorn, The Hand of

07:49.420 --> 07:56.520
Oberon, and The Courts of Chaos. This series is a prime example, I think, of science fantasy.

07:57.260 --> 08:04.860
It's a true adventure story all the way through it. It is one continuous story. The basis of the

08:04.860 --> 08:14.540
idea of the story is that the real world is a world called amber. And amber casts shadows of itself

08:14.540 --> 08:20.520
throughout what we would call alternate or parallel universes. The earth that we live on is but one

08:20.520 --> 08:26.280
of these shadow worlds of which there are an infinite number. This goes all the way until all order

08:26.280 --> 08:32.680
is lost and only chaos remains. This is the opposite end of the spectrum from the real world of amber.

08:33.100 --> 08:39.420
Amber is ruled by a family, a family of immortals. Oberon is the king, the father, but he has nine

08:39.420 --> 08:48.740
sons and I believe it's four daughters. They are all immortal. They all have the blood of amber in them.

08:49.520 --> 08:56.640
It's their blood and their power that keeps amber in existence along with this pattern which

08:58.060 --> 09:03.520
seems to be the force that keeps order in amber and therefore throughout the rest of all these

09:03.520 --> 09:08.340
alternate universes. The trouble starts when this family, when the father, the king Oberon,

09:08.340 --> 09:12.500
suddenly disappears and there's a struggle for power among the brothers to see who is going to

09:12.500 --> 09:20.720
become king. I think that Zalazny is very crafty in the way that he leads us into the story with

09:20.720 --> 09:26.400
the main character Corwin. He is at the very first of the series in the very first book Nine

09:26.400 --> 09:31.480
Princes and Amber. We wake up with Corwin in a hospital. He doesn't know who he is or what he is

09:31.480 --> 09:42.300
where he is and he bluffs his way into knowledge of who he is and as he learns we learn and begins

09:42.300 --> 09:50.020
the story in that manner as he wakes up on earth in a totally normal seemingly scientific sound

09:50.020 --> 09:58.180
logical atmosphere but in very short order things start happening that are totally fantastic

09:59.300 --> 10:05.620
and yet it's kept in balance because he is on this earth as he begins to leave it and go into

10:05.620 --> 10:11.360
the other alternate worlds. The blend is really well handled I think. With Zalazny I think it's

10:11.360 --> 10:16.000
important to realize that no matter what kind of book he writes there will always be an element of

10:16.000 --> 10:23.720
fantasy in it. He seems to enjoy working in that kind of field. In one of his most recent works,

10:23.720 --> 10:29.380
a novel called Roadmarks, he has people traveling down what appears to be a freeway

10:30.000 --> 10:36.320
but the exit ramps lead off to certain places in time and in space that could not possibly be

10:36.320 --> 10:40.900
along the road like one exit would be off to Babylon in the fifth century and then the next

10:40.900 --> 10:47.880
exit would be somewhere in the future in New York. It's a fascinating book following the travels of

10:47.880 --> 10:51.640
one specific character and the outcomes of his travels.

11:06.100 --> 11:11.180
Possibly one of the most eloquent of science fantasy writers is Jack Vance who is not known

11:11.180 --> 11:15.360
quite as well as some of the other writers but has written some fabulous science fantasy stories.

11:16.240 --> 11:20.360
Yeah his classic book I think in the field of science fantasy is called The Dying Earth

11:21.680 --> 11:26.760
published in 1950 although he was writing it through the mid-40s. For a number of years it

11:26.760 --> 11:33.600
existed more or less as an underground book as it's called meaning it was read mostly by people

11:33.600 --> 11:39.140
who were well into the field and understood most of the authors who were writing but

11:39.140 --> 11:45.160
the last few years Vance has gained a tremendous reputation but The Dying Earth is a collection

11:45.160 --> 11:51.800
of stories and Vance has used a particular environment for his stories in that book.

11:52.420 --> 12:00.500
He conceives of the earth as the title indicates dying. The sun is a red star which is almost out

12:00.500 --> 12:08.580
it's barely giving out any warmth. The earth is millions of years in the future the mountains

12:08.580 --> 12:16.160
are worn down the it's a very softened environment the forests are old decrepit there are only

12:16.160 --> 12:20.960
probably a few thousand people on the earth and they know that their time is approaching you know

12:20.960 --> 12:25.960
where their lives and their earth is going to going to end but the interesting part of that is that

12:26.820 --> 12:31.580
science is dead science has not been around for perhaps millions of years magic works

12:32.280 --> 12:36.940
and the people who are left on earth are mostly magicians they have spells

12:38.120 --> 12:43.960
they have tremendous powers that they use to either fight each other or get what they want whatever

12:46.400 --> 12:49.940
and Vance has written about six or seven stories around this particular

12:51.280 --> 12:56.180
in this particular environment and I might mention just a couple of the stories to illustrate

12:56.180 --> 13:01.880
why this can be called science fantasy in one of the first stories in the book there's a magician

13:01.880 --> 13:08.960
called pandalume who knows almost all of the spells who was a genius at magic he's admired by

13:08.960 --> 13:15.200
almost everybody who exists on earth and he is studying a brand new field that he's just discovered

13:15.200 --> 13:19.620
and he's fascinated with it and he says the the whole underpinning of the universe is based upon

13:19.620 --> 13:25.620
this field and it's called mathematics which is kind of interesting because here are magicians

13:26.400 --> 13:32.860
looking back and rediscovering a science which has not been around for millions of years in another

13:32.860 --> 13:40.260
story um ulandore there's a ruins of an ancient city which one of the magicians discovers and

13:40.260 --> 13:47.520
it's full of these metallic vehicles which we would recognize as cars or some kind of

13:48.300 --> 13:54.120
device of transportation he's fascinated with them learns how to use them again a reference to the

13:54.120 --> 13:59.500
past of the fact that science did once exist and in the last story in the volume perhaps one of the

13:59.500 --> 14:04.580
major ones called guy all of sphere now guy all is a hero a magician but a hero nonetheless

14:05.100 --> 14:12.520
who believes that magic is limited he gets tired of it he goes off on a quest to reach what is

14:12.520 --> 14:17.340
called the museum of man which is supposed to contain all of the knowledge of the human race

14:18.380 --> 14:25.540
he finds the museum and after a number of difficulties he learns that far in the past

14:25.540 --> 14:30.940
earthmen had the capacity to space travel to leave the planet and go to other places

14:32.040 --> 14:37.200
and since earth is dying since it's not going to last that much longer and since magic seems to be a

14:37.200 --> 14:42.080
dead end he decides to take up science and see if he can do something about getting people back off

14:42.080 --> 14:47.780
the earth so it's sort of an interesting approach to science fantasy and one would have to read

14:47.780 --> 14:52.880
vance to really appreciate the man's style the beauty of his language the the the brilliance of

14:52.880 --> 14:59.520
the way he describes things it's almost amazing that in just a few words he can paint such a vivid

14:59.520 --> 15:07.240
visual picture in the story lion the wanderer lion is a sort of vagabond he is enticed by a girl

15:07.240 --> 15:12.160
into going and trying to steal a tapestry which is guarded by tune the unavoidable

15:12.680 --> 15:18.520
and when lion creeps up upon where the tapestry is hung and jerks it aside tune is hiding behind

15:18.520 --> 15:24.840
it and lion runs off he's a very swift almost blindingly swift person and he runs away from him

15:24.840 --> 15:30.500
but tune is following him right on his heels and lion uses some magic a magical hoop which allows

15:30.500 --> 15:34.760
him to become invisible and he steps through it and vanishes and he's standing there thinking

15:34.760 --> 15:39.720
he's hiding and all of a sudden a voice from behind him says i am tuned the unavoidable

15:40.280 --> 15:45.360
and then the scene shifts back to the girl who has just received two long threads from the tapestry

15:45.360 --> 15:50.260
and a message from tune who said he's sending her these two long threads because of the two

15:50.260 --> 15:56.640
beautiful large golden eyes he's added to his cloak that kind of summary i don't think um

15:57.440 --> 16:02.960
can really convey to people the alianess that jack vance can uh can communicate in his writing

16:03.680 --> 16:09.280
Barry Malzberg a noted critic and author both of science fiction is has made the statement that

16:09.280 --> 16:15.920
jack vance is the greatest portrayer of total alianess in science fiction and i quote he is

16:15.920 --> 16:20.240
simply one of the best there ever has been at grasping that the material of science fiction

16:20.240 --> 16:26.480
will feel differently to those who live through it and has brought that difference alive and

16:26.480 --> 16:30.540
malzberg also feels that jack vance is one of the ten most important writers in the history of the

16:30.540 --> 16:35.280
field it's a shame that he's not better known but he's a very private person he hasn't publicized

16:35.280 --> 16:42.660
himself he hasn't um gone out of his way to uh to drum interest in his work but he has won both

16:43.240 --> 16:49.340
hugos and nebulas uh one of his hugos came in 1962 for the story the dragon masters

16:49.980 --> 16:54.400
which would also qualify as an excellent example of science fantasy um

16:55.860 --> 16:59.800
basically and briefly that the plot takes place place on a world called airlift

17:00.540 --> 17:05.520
it's a very bleak world in an unknown corner of the universe but it once was part of the human

17:05.520 --> 17:10.180
empire uh it's been cut off now because space travel has been forgotten and the people on this

17:10.180 --> 17:16.260
world have i guess degenerated into a sort of a middle ages type existence uh they live in castles

17:16.260 --> 17:22.920
they they breed animals they exist on agriculture they have sort of a futile existence but the animal

17:22.920 --> 17:28.800
that they breed mostly are uh is dragons and they breed all sizes of dragons dragons to fight with

17:28.800 --> 17:35.340
dragons to ride dragons to cultivate with uh a fascinating society advances built up and the

17:35.340 --> 17:43.220
conflict occurs when a a group of mutated humans come to the world and try to take off the men

17:43.220 --> 17:49.840
who are here as slaves and a war occurs between between this dragon culture and between these

17:49.840 --> 17:55.480
these men these mutated men who have space weapons a very interesting book and again in the in the

17:55.480 --> 18:01.380
style advances is famous for another author and macafe has written some books dealing with

18:01.380 --> 18:07.340
dragons in fact there are six of them in total the books are grouped into two trilogies one the

18:07.340 --> 18:12.800
dragonriders of per and the other a trilogy on the harper hall of pern through the different

18:12.800 --> 18:17.740
books you find out that early in pern's history or at least when mankind had been on pern they had

18:17.740 --> 18:23.960
to genetically alter some of the native life form which was a small dragon like creature not much

18:23.960 --> 18:30.560
bigger than a than a small bird they had to genetically alter the small dragons and make

18:30.560 --> 18:36.980
them into much larger dragons uh those familiar from from human mythology in order to fight an

18:36.980 --> 18:42.120
invading alien spore from what they call the red star it's actually a planet orbiting outside the

18:42.120 --> 18:48.360
orbit of pern the three books and the dragonriders of pern series are the dragonflight dragon quest

18:48.360 --> 18:53.700
and the white dragon and it follows the adventures of several of the main characters in the series

18:53.700 --> 19:00.360
that being florr who is the leader of brindon weir which is an enclave of dragons and flanore

19:00.360 --> 19:07.960
his brother and lesa who is the weirwoman are really the the driving force behind brindon weir

19:07.960 --> 19:13.320
the first book dragonflight is based around the adventures of those three characters and it picks

19:13.320 --> 19:18.300
up again in dragon quest and then goes on to white dragon which was a nationwide bestseller

19:19.180 --> 19:25.600
and it revolves around the adventures of jackson and his dragon named ruth and their adventures at

19:25.600 --> 19:31.120
brindon weir and again in another part of the planet one of the most interesting aspects of the

19:31.120 --> 19:36.540
novels is the bond between the dragons and their riders this bond is formed when the dragons are

19:36.540 --> 19:43.120
born and goes with them throughout both of their lives yeah at first jackson has to be careful how

19:43.120 --> 19:49.720
how he uses ruth the dragon he bonds himself with because he's a young lord and he's due to take

19:49.720 --> 19:59.500
over one of the holes or one of the almost like a feudal manner an organizational structure on the

19:59.500 --> 20:04.360
planet but he's not yet ready for that and he's not supposed to have a dragon of his own but he

20:04.360 --> 20:09.820
does bond himself to ruth and he and ruth become extremely close and we find out that the dragons

20:09.820 --> 20:16.640
are highly intelligent um they communicate telepathically with their human uh i guess you'd

20:16.640 --> 20:23.520
call them mates or bonders if you want to call them that uh and jackson teaches ruth various things

20:23.520 --> 20:30.440
he trains ruth to do what these dragons have been bred to do which is to fight the thread nobody knows

20:30.440 --> 20:35.740
this yet because ruth is different he is smaller and he's white but he does have special powers

20:36.820 --> 20:42.640
and as it turns out it's a fortunate thing that jackson did train ruth and that he did bond himself

20:42.640 --> 20:49.620
to him because uh there's a tremendous threat that comes from various places but mostly with the

20:49.620 --> 20:57.480
threads jackson and ruth are equipped to handle it and uh in fighting the threads it almost becomes

20:57.480 --> 21:04.500
a heroic task for jackson he saves the men of pern yes it's really an unusual incident that

21:05.220 --> 21:10.220
ruth was allowed to live he he wasn't really hatching out of his shell but jackson leaped into

21:10.220 --> 21:14.160
the the pit where the hatching was taking place and broke the shell and let him out

21:15.620 --> 21:22.040
her other trilogy revolves around the harper hall or the uh menstruals of pern which go about

21:22.040 --> 21:29.060
singing songs which carry about various information and are used as teaching tools and these stories

21:29.060 --> 21:37.180
revolve around uh robinton the master harper of pern are the leader of the menstruals and uh menoli

21:37.760 --> 21:44.600
his uh female apprentice who's the first girl in the harper hall in all those books i think

21:44.600 --> 21:49.600
mccaffrey has shown a tremendous talent at developing an entire world you know by the time you finish

21:49.600 --> 21:54.080
the pern books you feel it that you've been in a different place you know very different from earth

21:54.080 --> 21:59.740
totally believable um and that skill i think is reflected in the fact that she's won both a

21:59.740 --> 22:06.600
hugo and a nebula back in 60s 1967 and 68 and she was the first woman science fiction writer to win

22:06.600 --> 22:07.600
both of those awards

22:40.420 --> 22:41.820
um

23:11.420 --> 23:16.340
Another entirely different way almost of looking at science fantasy would be to simply consider

23:16.340 --> 23:18.240
the feeling or mood of a work.

23:18.240 --> 23:24.960
Is there an atmosphere for instance of melodrama? Is the conflict basic good versus evil with a

23:24.960 --> 23:30.800
totally black villain and a shining too good to be true hero? When you sense these qualities in

23:30.800 --> 23:33.120
a work you probably have something that can be termed science fantasy.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.360
What about Superman for instance? Is he a science fiction character or is he science fantasy?

23:41.360 --> 23:46.770
It's easy to see him as science fiction I think. After all he's an alien from another planet and

23:46.770 --> 23:54.150
the special powers that he has are simply due to the fact he's here on earth and his being,

23:54.370 --> 23:59.850
his metabolism, his alien structure allows him to fly and to perform superhuman feats but on

23:59.850 --> 24:03.850
his own planet he couldn't do those things. So we could look at that book simply as a book about

24:03.850 --> 24:09.310
an alien on earth and call it a science fiction book. But since it really doesn't have any scientific

24:09.310 --> 24:14.270
basis behind his powers are the abilities which he acquires simply by being under a different

24:14.270 --> 24:21.770
type of sun which really doesn't have any drastic difference in radiation between the red giant star

24:21.770 --> 24:27.390
which he is under and the yellow G type star of earth. There really is any scientific basis to

24:27.390 --> 24:33.130
his powers. I would say he's a fantasy character. I would say he's a fantasy character too but I

24:33.130 --> 24:38.210
would think it would be more based on the fact that he's a larger than life hero. He's not really

24:38.210 --> 24:43.450
an alien in the sense that we've come to know them in science fiction such as works by Larry Niven

24:43.450 --> 24:51.150
or by Hal Clement. It's really a human character and he's there as a hero that's his whole purpose.

24:52.350 --> 24:59.590
It's a melodrama in many ways. It's very very good against very very evil. It's really in that sense

24:59.590 --> 25:05.690
a fantasy creature. What about Star Wars? That's most people I would think would consider that to be a

25:05.690 --> 25:12.450
science fiction movie. It has spaceships, it has ray guns, all sorts of fantastic technologically

25:12.450 --> 25:19.390
looking devices. But it's really been put forward as a science fantasy. I mean once again you have

25:19.390 --> 25:25.930
a larger than life hero or heroes. One of the ultimate bad guys ever created by the cinema,

25:26.410 --> 25:34.530
Darth Vader. The science in it is really in the background. They have no real hard scientific

25:34.530 --> 25:41.150
explanation for the items, the scientific gadgets that they have. They simply turn them on and they

25:41.150 --> 25:49.910
work. That's an element of science fantasy. I think this gets us into the specific problems that

25:49.910 --> 25:56.490
you have when you're trying to define science fantasy. Technically speaking in Star Wars there's

25:56.490 --> 26:02.950
nothing there that cannot be explained by extrapolation of current known physics and science.

26:03.590 --> 26:11.430
There's just nothing there that is really a fantasy like say magic. It's all science fiction.

26:12.530 --> 26:21.470
However the story itself is flowing with fantasy elements in terms of style and the way it's formatted

26:21.470 --> 26:29.390
as almost a melodrama or a western or a soap opera in space. It's also an intentional blend of styles

26:29.390 --> 26:37.550
in things like for instance the lightsabers. The technology of science fiction is used there to

26:37.550 --> 26:43.870
create a saber that uses some sort of force field and yet you're still dealing with the stylistic

26:43.870 --> 26:49.990
element of a sword fight which gets you back into the fantasy realm. So it's an interesting blend

26:50.750 --> 26:56.590
of science fiction elements with the fantasy style and this too I think should be termed

26:56.590 --> 27:02.490
science fantasy. One other series of books that might be mentioned in this same stylistic category

27:02.490 --> 27:08.610
is another series of works by Jack Vance known as the the Chai series, Planet of Adventure,

27:08.830 --> 27:15.730
written between 1968 and 1970. Yeah that book has a almost a pure science fiction beginning.

27:16.050 --> 27:19.830
A scout ship is wrecked on another planet and it looks like it's going to be a straight science

27:19.830 --> 27:25.710
fiction adventure but very quickly you learned this is planet Chai. It really has no science to it.

27:25.710 --> 27:30.750
It becomes almost a sword and sorcery book. Although the the sorcery part is downplayed. It

27:30.750 --> 27:37.810
becomes mostly sword fights, adventure quests, saving maidens, etc. etc. by the hero Adam Wreath

27:37.810 --> 27:45.930
who is a full-blown hero much in the in the in the way that Superman or Luke Skywalker would be.

27:47.090 --> 27:51.770
And I think we have to mention some other names of authors who've written science fantasy.

27:53.150 --> 27:56.890
Elsprague the Camp and Fletcher Pratt for instance collaborated on a series of books.

27:57.830 --> 28:04.110
Lath Brackett wrote a series of a fact a trilogy of books based around a character Eric John Start.

28:04.730 --> 28:08.850
Even Robert Heinlein who most people would call a fairly classic science fiction writer

28:08.850 --> 28:14.910
tried his hand at one the science fantasy novel Glory Road back in 1963 which isn't bad.

28:15.670 --> 28:19.970
And you have Paul Anderson of course who wrote things like The High Crusade and Three Hearts

28:19.970 --> 28:26.210
and Three Lions that would be science fantasy. And probably one of the most recent entries or

28:26.210 --> 28:30.730
one of the most recent authors in science fantasy feel is Jack Chalker who's been writing a series

28:30.730 --> 28:36.670
of novels called the Well World novels with their protagonist Nathan Brazil. And also Philip

28:36.670 --> 28:43.150
Jose Farmer who wrote his River Whirl series in 1971 which has many aspects of science fantasy in it.

28:44.150 --> 28:50.050
I think everyone enjoys a rousing adventure tale especially when it includes magic, sword fights,

28:50.230 --> 28:55.930
unicorns, dragons and other such fantastic fare. When a fantasy adventure like that is combined

28:55.930 --> 29:00.810
with the more believable elements of science fiction the blend is somehow especially attractive.

29:01.830 --> 29:06.250
The worlds of science fantasy are quite unlimited and hopefully will continue to make their appearance

29:06.250 --> 29:07.850
on the science fiction bookcase.

29:19.590 --> 29:25.330
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction
