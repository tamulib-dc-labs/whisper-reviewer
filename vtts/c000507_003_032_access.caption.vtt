Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.040 --> 00:34.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.840
And here are your hosts.

00:43.900 --> 00:52.180
This is David Carson. And David Crews. Few characters in either science fiction
or fantasy have been as fascinating to readers as Conan the Barbarian. Conan is

00:52.180 --> 01:00.180
the creation of Robert E. Howard, a writer of the 1930s who lived in Cross
Plains, Texas. Howard filled the pulp magazines of his day with westerns,

01:00.340 --> 01:07.960
detective stories, horror stories, science fantasy, just about anything that
would sell. But he became best known for his tales of heroic fantasy,

01:08.300 --> 01:17.060
particularly the ones that involved Conan. Conan was a giant barbarian who lived
a swashbuckling life in the mythical Hyborian age that Howard created. There is

01:17.060 --> 01:26.160
nothing fancy or subtle about Conan. He survives and flourishes by pure muscle
and swordplay. Howard's writing was colorful and exciting and perfectly matched

01:26.160 --> 01:26.660
his hero.

01:32.620 --> 01:41.200
Howard committed suicide in 1936 at the age of 30. He left a number of
unfinished Conan manuscripts and story ideas. And the character of Conan was so

01:41.200 --> 01:49.800
appealing to readers that authors have recently been writing new material on him
or finishing Howard's own incomplete stories. Noted science fiction and fantasy

01:49.800 --> 01:57.780
author L. Sprague de Camp has written Conan stories and become interested enough
in Howard's life to write a biography of him. We asked de Camp if Howard was

01:57.780 --> 02:07.340
anything like Conan. Well, everybody knows that Conan is an idealization of
Howard. In other words, the kind of person that Howard thought he would have

02:07.340 --> 02:23.780
liked to have been the ruthless, domineering, footloose, irresponsible
adventurer. Actually, Robert was no respecter of laws and regulations. But the

02:23.780 --> 02:34.500
key word here is idealization. De Camp says Howard and Conan were nothing alike.
Actually, Robert was just the opposite type. Except for hot tempers and

02:34.500 --> 02:50.440
chivalrous attitude toward women, they had nothing in common. Robert Howard was
shy, bookish, compassionate, extremely polite,

02:55.700 --> 03:09.920
and socially timid, and so law-abiding that he wouldn't cut across the
neighbor's lot even, although everybody else across the lanes did. He was just

03:09.920 --> 03:20.680
about as different from the character Conan in the stories as a person could be.
De Camp believes Howard yearned to live in a past age, some more heroic time

03:20.680 --> 03:32.000
than the present. Well, Robert was always talking a lot about how he wished that
he thought he'd have been, really in his element, if he'd been born on the Texan

03:32.000 --> 03:44.400
frontier in the 19th century, or in some barbarian society like the ancient
Gauls or Goths or somebody. Well, I don't, I think he'd have had a very

03:44.400 --> 03:57.760
unpleasant surprise. Because it wasn't, it wasn't his temperament at all. He was
a, he was a shy, bookish introvert. Finally, De Camp reveals that Howard had a

03:57.760 --> 04:09.440
serious mental problem. He had an outsized monkey on his back, and he was, he
was doomed from some way back. He planned his suicide ever since he was a little

04:09.440 --> 04:19.460
boy. He told his mother when he was a little kid even, Mama, when you
die, I want to die with you. And the foolish woman, I think, probably sort of

04:19.460 --> 04:28.900
giggled and encouraged him. It was long planned, and several people knew about
it. But they didn't do anything. The only thing you could have done with Robert

04:28.900 --> 04:38.260
was, if you'd gotten him to a good shrink early enough, quite a good many years
before he actually killed himself, why, something might have been done. But

04:38.260 --> 04:49.580
that, of course, is uncertain. Howard wrote some 21 Conan stories, most of which
appeared in Weird Tales in the 1930s. Only one novel, Conan the Conqueror, was

04:49.580 --> 04:54.240
published, and that was some time after Howard's death. More next time about
Robert E. Howard.

05:01.640 --> 05:09.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:09.700 --> 05:10.460
Odessa, Texas.

06:01.660 --> 06:05.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:21.620 --> 06:27.100
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.520
And here are your hosts.

06:36.160 --> 06:44.660
This is David Crews and David Carson. There are subcategories coming under the
general headings of science fiction and fantasy. One of the most popular these

06:44.660 --> 06:53.380
days is heroic fantasy. It's sometimes called sword and sorcery, a term that
almost serves as a definition for the genre. It deals with heroic barbarians

06:53.380 --> 07:02.180
swinging large bloody swords and sorcerers conjuring up all manner of demons.
And as we've said, it's popular nowadays, particularly the Conan stories of

07:02.180 --> 07:11.960
Robert E. Howard. We asked an authority on heroic fantasy, L. Sprague de Camp, to
tell us why the form is so fascinating to readers. I think that part of the

07:11.960 --> 07:30.900
popularity of the genre was a reaction to certain trends in fiction following
the Second World War, such as the fondness for heavily subjective psychological

07:30.900 --> 07:35.640
or psychiatric stories,

07:35.960 --> 07:50.680
very sentimental stories, stories glorifying the little man, the anti-hero, that
hopeless little jerk who can't do anything right and who has no brains or brawn

07:50.680 --> 08:01.320
or character and whose only function is to suffer and suffer. Well, I think
people got sort of tired of that after a while. So they then, between the

08:01.320 --> 08:12.240
paperback publication of the Conan stories, for which I can claim the credit,
I'm the one who sold them, and the paperback publication of Tolkien's Lord of

08:12.240 --> 08:26.640
the Rings, which was the other major factor in launching this boom, why that got
people to reading heroic fantasy on a large scale, which they are still doing.

08:37.840 --> 08:45.440
De Camp has written his own sword and sorcery, but he's also worked on the Conan
material of Robert E. Howard. He tells us how he was introduced to Howard's

08:45.440 --> 08:59.260
stories of Conan. ...York in, uh, it was around the end of 1950, and, uh, let me
see, I think it was, uh, I think it was a naval war game at Pratt's apartment or

08:59.260 --> 09:09.880
something. No, it wasn't. It was a party at Pratt's apartment. And, uh, he
handed me a copy of Conan the Conqueror, found in hardback, published by Gnome

09:09.880 --> 09:19.660
Press. And he said, here, take this along. I think you might find it
interesting. I don't care much for it myself, but who knows? So I took it. It

09:19.660 --> 09:29.760
seems that, uh, Martin had, um, by inadvertence sent, uh, Fletcher two review
copies, and Fletcher gave me one. So I started reading it on the train going

09:29.760 --> 09:40.280
home and was hooked right away. Kept on until I'd read the thing through, and
then I read it through again. Howard died in the 1930s, but De Camp became so

09:40.280 --> 09:49.260
involved with the character of Conan that he started to edit some of Howard's
papers and to write his own Conan stories. And then a year later, I found some,

09:49.440 --> 10:04.620
I learned about some unpublished Conan manuscripts in the custody of, uh, the
agent for the Howard Literary Estate. And, uh, I read them, and arrangements

10:04.620 --> 10:15.960
were made with the Howard Ayers and, uh, the agent for me to edit them for
public, and arrange for publication, and on, things have, uh, things have gone

10:15.960 --> 10:19.340
on, uh, on and on, and build up from that.

10:27.100 --> 10:35.960
De Camp has written original Conan material, but he's also finished incomplete
Howard stories and edited others. De Camp is also technical advisor to a movie

10:35.960 --> 10:44.760
on Conan that will premiere this week. It's entitled Conan the Barbarian, and it
will show you what heroic fantasy is all about. More about Robert E. Howard next

10:44.760 --> 10:45.060
time.

10:52.300 --> 11:00.200
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

11:00.200 --> 11:00.960
Odessa, Texas.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:08.240 --> 12:13.640
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.040
And here are your hosts.

12:23.000 --> 12:31.060
This is David Carson. And David Crews. Robert E. Howard, the creator of Conan the
Barbarian, was a paradox. He was brought up on the arid plains of west central

12:31.060 --> 12:39.820
Texas, lived in the small country town of Cross Plains, and hardly did any
traveling, and he died by his own hand at the age of 30. Yet Howard wrote heroic

12:39.820 --> 12:47.140
stories that were set in the mythical age after the fall of Atlantis. He was
fascinated with the misty, cold northern landscape in which he set his tales.

12:47.720 --> 12:56.180
Conan, his greatest creation, was a barbarian from the north, a giant who strode
across the Hyborian age wielding a bloody broadsword. But Howard's life was a

12:56.180 --> 13:05.420
quiet one. He was introverted, bookish, and shy. As far as we know, he was never
in a brawl or fight of any kind. Why did Howard create Conan and place him in a

13:05.420 --> 13:14.520
mythical northern landscape? What sort of mind would conceive of a barbarian
hero, a loner who spurned civilization? We spoke with Dr. Charlotte Laughlin, a

13:14.520 --> 13:22.260
professor at Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas, not far from Howard's
home in Cross Plains. Dr. Laughlin is intimate with Howard's life and has done

13:22.260 --> 13:30.980
research for her Howard biography. She believes there are some reasons for
Howard's obsession with Conan. I think that, again, it was a sort of explanation

13:30.980 --> 13:41.000
for why he did not fit in with other people. He liked to believe, I am the last
barbarian. It's because, and my type will prevail. He liked to believe that the

13:41.000 --> 13:49.580
other people had a veneer of civilization on them that got them away from the
basics that were really important. And if you've read his correspondence with

13:49.580 --> 14:01.000
Lovecraft, they had long arguments about the physical versus the intellectual
needs of a society. And Howard would say that in the tough country where he

14:01.000 --> 14:10.880
lived, you had to be physically fit. And he spent a great deal of his life, his
adult life, trying to be physically fit, boxing and working out and that sort of

14:10.880 --> 14:11.100
thing.

14:17.580 --> 14:26.100
Howard also was fascinated with the legendary past of Britain, especially with
the savage Picts and the early heroes of Celtic myth. Some of his Conan stories,

14:26.260 --> 14:35.360
such as Across the Dark River, have ancient Britain as their setting. We asked
Dr. Laughlin why Howard was so drawn to this material. He claimed that he was

14:35.360 --> 14:43.700
full-blood Irish and they were the Irish kings like some other people we know
claim to be. But there's no evidence that he certainly was not full-blood Irish.

14:43.860 --> 14:54.020
People have traced his genealogy. But this was part of his image of himself. He
was trying to project other people and trying to create for himself. There

14:54.020 --> 15:04.920
again, he wrote at one time that he wrote about the barren, cold, windswept,
damp areas even though he lived here. I think that again might be a sort of wish

15:04.920 --> 15:12.720
fulfillment. Who wouldn't like to be someplace where it's cold on a day like
this? He wanted to be away from where he was because I don't think we can

15:12.720 --> 15:25.800
underestimate the anger and frustration that was boiling around in Robert Howard
all the time. I see it in all of his poetry and a great deal of his fiction.

15:26.760 --> 15:35.080
Cross Plains neighbors say that he had a, there was a big tree stump out by his
yard and I believe it was a sledgehammer not an axe. And sometimes in the middle

15:35.080 --> 15:41.540
of the day he would go out there, you know, and you could just see that he was
so tense and he would take that sledgehammer and he would just wham it and wham

15:41.540 --> 15:51.400
it and wham it on this tree stump. That a tremendous amount of anger he didn't
fit in with other people. He wanted to be somewhere else so he wrote about

15:51.400 --> 15:54.120
something that was like nothing he had experienced.

16:01.120 --> 16:10.120
Howard wrote reams of fantasy in the pulp era of the 1930s, most of it for Weird
Tales. We asked Dr. Laughlin why Howard wrote fantasy. Did he have the talent to

16:10.120 --> 16:17.880
write more realistic fiction that might have gotten him out of the pulp ghetto?
He may have had the talent but I certainly don't believe he was capable of

16:17.880 --> 16:26.660
writing realistic fiction. He was not that closely tied to reality himself. I
don't believe he ever could have written realistic novels. He had to write

16:26.660 --> 16:31.060
fantasies of some sort. More about Robert E. Howard next time.

16:38.040 --> 16:46.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:46.000 --> 16:52.340
Odessa, Texas. 

17:37.200 --> 17:41.460
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:57.240 --> 18:02.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.960
And here are your hosts.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.820
This is David Crews.

18:13.120 --> 18:13.780
And David Carson.

18:14.300 --> 18:20.700
Fantasy writer Robert E. Howard grew up in the 1920s and the 1930s in the small Texas town of Cross Plains.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.600
But he wasn't like other small town boys. He kept to himself quite a bit.

18:24.600 --> 18:32.240
He read a lot and used a vivid imagination to create his memorable heroic fantasies, for most of which are the stories of Conan the Barbarian.

18:32.920 --> 18:37.500
Howard died in 1936, but some of the people in Cross Plains still remember him clearly.

18:38.080 --> 18:44.860
We spoke with two of Howard's friends, Jack Scott, the editor of the Cross Plains newspaper, and Leroy Butler, Howard's next door neighbor.

18:45.380 --> 18:51.100
Butler remembers a time when he and Howard were still children and they bought some swords from a mail order company in New York.

18:52.120 --> 18:58.960
But we ordered those things and we'd get out in the backyard and wrap a band down a hamster around our hedge-like pirate.

19:00.260 --> 19:03.480
And we'd get out fence with those things.

19:04.260 --> 19:09.960
Of course we didn't dare, you know, hit each other with them because they were, they'd have gone through you.

19:11.840 --> 19:19.900
But we did that quite a bit. We had an immense live oak tree in our backyard and we'd get out there and shade that oak tree in.

19:22.780 --> 19:33.360
Pretend that we were back maybe in the dark ages or something or in the time of the Spanish man.

19:34.880 --> 19:40.800
Things like that. He had things like that on his mind all the time.

19:41.140 --> 19:44.400
Butler says that Robert was a loner dedicated to his writing.

19:45.420 --> 19:48.560
Robert never married. He never seemed interested in girls.

19:51.740 --> 19:58.560
And he did have one girlfriend there in Cross Plains for a time. I'd see him out in the car driving around once in a while.

19:59.420 --> 20:01.620
But I don't think that lasted long.

20:02.420 --> 20:07.400
He was just wrapped up in his, in his work writing those stories.

20:09.480 --> 20:15.860
And he had a blast-in-back porch on the southeast side of the house there.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.620
And it wasn't too far from my mother's bedroom.

20:22.460 --> 20:28.500
And a lot of times at night he'd wake her up with that typewriter clock in, you know, at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning.

20:28.500 --> 20:36.480
Some inspiration. He'd probably be laying there in bed and think of something and he'd get up and write it down right quick.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.280
And he just worked all hours.

20:42.400 --> 20:55.300
Jack Scott also comments on Howard's unusual personality. Howard was a little on
the odd side. He wasn't intimate with very many people. He was rather aloof. But

20:55.300 --> 21:07.900
he was a big, robust man. To me, he was a combination of Edgar Allen Poe and
Jack London, if you can imagine that two together. In 1936, when Howard's mother

21:07.900 --> 21:19.420
was dying of a terminal illness, Howard took his own life. I remember the
morning he killed himself very well. I heard on the street that Robert Howard

21:19.420 --> 21:30.640
had just shot himself. I immediately jumped in my car and ran down there and got
down there. A few neighbors had gathered. It wasn't generally known over the

21:30.640 --> 21:42.540
town, but the old justice of the peace was standing there on the gallery, the
front porch. When I walked up, he called me and said, Come here, Jack. And I

21:42.540 --> 21:53.580
stepped up there and he took me into the bedroom. And he pointed to an old
Underwood typewriter. It had four lines written on it there. And Howard had,

21:54.020 --> 22:06.620
when he had been told that his mother wouldn't live throughout the day, he went
to this typewriter, wrote these four lines, walked outside, sat down in his car

22:06.620 --> 22:17.740
and shot his head off. And this old JP asked me what these four lines meant.
They said, I'm sure you've read them. All fled, all done, so lift me on the pyre.

22:17.900 --> 22:23.600
The feast is over. The lamps expire. More about Robert E. Howard next time.

22:30.700 --> 22:38.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:38.700 --> 22:39.480
Odessa, Texas.

23:25.260 --> 23:29.280
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:45.520 --> 23:50.880
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.360
And here are your hosts.

24:00.000 --> 24:08.560
This is David Carson. And David Crews. Will Conan the Barbarian ever die, or will
he go on forever? A large portion of the fantasy section of bookstores these

24:08.560 --> 24:16.960
days is filled with books about Conan, the heroic barbarian created by the late
Robert E. Howard. Howard devised a mythical era for his hero and called it the

24:16.960 --> 24:25.800
Hyborian Age. The period falls somewhere between the fall of Atlantis and the
beginnings of recorded history. Conan is a giant barbarian from Cimmeria, a

24:25.800 --> 24:34.380
region to the north of the more civilized Hyborian kingdoms. With his huge
sword, he is an irresistible force that no man can stand up to. Howard wrote

24:34.380 --> 24:43.560
some 21 Conan stories in the 1930s, most published in the pulp magazine Weird
Tales. They trace the life of the barbarian from his teenage years to his later

24:43.560 --> 24:52.340
maturity when he became a king. The tales are full of lusty, bloody adventure,
pure escape fantasy that appeals to man's primal instincts. Conan battles

24:52.340 --> 25:01.500
warriors, sorcerers, and monsters of all shapes. He's a thief, a soldier, a
swashbuckling pirate, and a king. The Conan stories are so popular that a number

25:01.500 --> 25:08.600
of publishing houses have been putting them out. And a number of different
authors have been writing Conan stories. Howard left many gaps in the life of

25:08.600 --> 25:16.240
Conan, and various contemporary writers have been filling those gaps with
original stories. L. Sprague de Camp was the first author to do that. These

25:16.240 --> 25:25.540
stories done by other writers are called pastiches, and established writers such
as de Camp, Andrew J. Offutt, Poul Anderson, Lin Carter, and Bjorn Nyberg have

25:25.540 --> 25:34.080
done them. We went to Robert E. Howard's home territory, the Brownwood Cross
Plains area of west central Texas, to speak with Dr. Charlotte Laughlin and Dr.

25:34.240 --> 25:43.000
William Kreider. Dr. Laughlin has done research for a biography of Howard, and
Dr. Kreider teaches science fiction and fantasy at Howard Payne University. Dr.

25:43.160 --> 25:54.520
Kreider explains what a pastiche is. Well, in the sense that we've been talking
about it, it's where one writer takes a character and a world, like the Hyborian

25:54.520 --> 26:06.020
age created by another writer, and writes new stories with the same character in
the same setting. And he gets the full credit for the story, but the other

26:06.020 --> 26:21.720
writer has created the character and the historical setting. Also, de Camp did
something similar, where he took incomplete Howard stories and changed them into

26:21.720 --> 26:31.700
Conan stories, which would be a pastiche of a slightly different kind, but it's
the same principle operating.

26:40.880 --> 26:49.280
The biography of Howard, entitled Dark Valley Destiny, has been written by A.
Sprague de Camp and his wife Catherine, and will probably be out sometime in the

26:49.280 --> 26:57.600
next year. The book will mainly be a psychological study of Howard, which
attempts to explain why he wrote the kind of material he did. Conan has been so

26:57.600 --> 27:05.640
popular that a major movie about him, entitled Conan the Barbarian, is
premiering this week across the country. It was filmed in Spain by director John

27:05.640 --> 27:13.100
Milius and produced by De Laurentiis, and has muscle man Arnold
Schwarzenegger playing Conan. Early reports indicate that it does a marvelous

27:13.100 --> 27:20.520
job of conveying the atmosphere of sword and sorcery essential to a Conan
adventure. Loughlin and Kreider talk about the movie and about Conan's

27:20.520 --> 27:34.780
popularity. If this is a huge success, like Star Wars, let's say, that could
give even more emphasis to this kind of thing, and we may see Howard going on

27:34.780 --> 27:46.440
forever with these pastiches being done by... I think it's possible that they
would be continued, because the original idea was to fill out Conan's life, you

27:46.440 --> 27:55.300
know, have his life completely covered by the pastiches from, I don't know if he
went to his boyhood, but certainly all of his adult life when he was an old King

27:55.300 --> 28:03.400
Conan. And it's already gone beyond that. They filled out his life, and then
they're going back to, you know, this stage in his life. He did such and such.

28:04.280 --> 28:13.580
So certainly they're not going to stop with what would be the chronological life
of Conan. So the potential to go on beyond is there. The potential to keep Conan

28:13.580 --> 28:18.240
alive and adventuring is definitely there. We should be hearing a lot more from
Conan.

28:25.620 --> 28:33.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

28:33.900 --> 28:34.700
Odessa, Texas.
