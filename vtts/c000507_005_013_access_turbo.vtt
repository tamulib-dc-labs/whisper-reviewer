And here are your hosts.

02:58.760 --> 03:06.560
This is Daryl Lane. And David Crews. Norman Spinrad has strong opinions about
science fiction and its place in today's world. As a noted author who helped

03:06.560 --> 03:14.380
bring the science fiction new wave to this country, and as two-time president of
the Science Fiction Writers of America, Spinrad's ideas should be heard. One

03:14.380 --> 03:23.280
thing he feels strongly about is that science fiction has not been treated
fairly by book reviewers. As a category, you know, it is treated very unfairly

03:23.280 --> 03:35.040
and very cavalierly by the powers that be, which is mainly the New York Times
Book Review and the New York Review of Books and the so-called New York Literary

03:35.040 --> 03:43.140
Establishment, which really does have a very heavy effect on the way books are
published. These people, for instance, came down on the American Book Awards,

03:43.400 --> 03:52.140
succeeded in getting science fiction knocked out of the American Book Awards. A
real small clique of people in New York City who felt that it was really bad to

03:52.140 --> 03:59.780
have these awards given to things like science fiction, that it was bad to take
it away from a small jury which they could control and have thousands of people

03:59.780 --> 04:10.220
voting for. A very elitist, social fascist bunch of people who I have absolutely
no use for. And I'm sure they have no use for me. As president of the Science

04:10.220 --> 04:18.560
Fiction Writers of America, Spinrad has worked for some changes in the field.
One thing that I'm already halfway through getting done is to internationalize.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.680
It's to have an overseas region with an overseas director on our board of
directors. Because science fiction writing and publishing really is an

04:25.680 --> 04:34.180
international community. American writers sell their work all over the world.
English writers sell their work here. Foreign language writers have different

04:34.180 --> 04:41.180
problems. And we're all dealing with the same publishers. It certainly is an
international literature and it's a spirit of the future and the spirit of

04:41.180 --> 04:49.160
internationalism and so forth. I felt it should be an international
organization. That's one thing. The other thing that I want to do and halfway to

04:49.160 --> 04:56.640
doing is upgrading the Nebula Awards. We have moved it out of the Warwick Hotel.
We're moving it into a much bigger room in the world often, trying to make it

04:56.640 --> 05:06.620
into a more significant event than it has been. Again, orienting it towards the
world at large rather than towards the little in-group. Spinrad has always been

05:06.620 --> 05:12.820
concerned with the image science fiction has with the general public. He thinks
general readers should be made more aware of science fiction's unique

05:12.820 --> 05:21.740
possibilities and its genuine value. We asked him if science fiction movies have
a positive or negative influence on the public's image of the field. I don't

05:21.740 --> 05:31.940
know. I don't think they... Not really. I mean, the image of science fiction in
that respect has been very bad anyway. I don't think the movies really add to

05:31.940 --> 05:40.080
the image, but I don't think they detract from it either. If there are some
better, more sophisticated movies, they might help. As it is, it's just kind of

05:40.080 --> 05:48.380
neutral publicity, people more aware that it exists. I think it's positive and
will prove to be positive in the long range because a lot of people are being

05:48.380 --> 05:56.800
introduced to the imagery of science fiction with which they were unfamiliar
through these movies. And if you look at the evolution in the movies, you find

05:56.800 --> 06:03.380
that in the earlier science fiction movies, if you're going into space or
whatever it is, you had to spend like half an hour setting the thing. This is a

06:03.380 --> 06:11.260
spaceship. It takes off on the Earth. People float around it. You have to
familiarize the audience with all this unfamiliar imagery. Now they can just

06:11.260 --> 06:19.080
start a movie, bang, right off in a galaxy far away. Boom. Here's a spaceship in
the Stromo. Pow. Now, you know, that it was the first half hour of the

06:19.080 --> 06:26.620
conventional old-time science fiction movie is gone because people are now
familiar with this imagery. And I think these movies have brought a lot of new

06:26.620 --> 06:38.260
people into familiarity with these images. They made these images part of the
popular culture. These movies have been mainly aimed at kids and adolescents.

06:38.760 --> 06:48.600
Ten years from now, assuming that these people will ever read anything, they
will be ready to read science fiction of a more serious kind, assuming they're

06:48.600 --> 06:55.840
ready to read literature of a more serious kind at all, because they'll be
familiar with the material, familiar with the literature. It won't seem strange

06:55.840 --> 07:04.820
and weird to them because they will have grown up with it. That's why I think
magazines, even magazines like Starlog, in that sense, will have a long-term

07:04.820 --> 07:09.200
positive impact. More with Norman Spinrad on our next show.

08:09.300 --> 08:09.540
us.

08:25.440 --> 08:30.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.200
And here are your hosts.

08:40.040 --> 08:48.520
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. Norman Spinrad's best-known novel may be Bug
Jack Barron, a book which has stirred controversy in both England and America.

08:48.720 --> 08:56.740
It was published in this country in 1969, and it's a different sort of science
fiction novel. It's a good example of new-wave science fiction. Character and

08:56.740 --> 09:04.680
style are important, and it deals with social issues such as racism, the
establishment, drugs, the power of the media, and radical protests. There is

09:04.680 --> 09:11.520
also a good deal of sex and violence in the book, and the language is highly
colored. But Spinrad thinks the plot of the book conforms to traditional science

09:11.520 --> 09:21.000
fiction formulas. Actually, what I was trying to do in a way, the book has a
very traditional plot. As far as I was concerned, you know, it has a positive

09:21.000 --> 09:30.100
hero, it has a negative villain. The hero wins, the villain loses. All that
stuff that is considered, you know, the traditional way of plotting a book. And

09:30.100 --> 09:40.540
yet it's written in a different kind of way. It kind of takes that superficial
kind of plot and treats it in a realistic manner. The protagonist, Jack Barron,

09:40.600 --> 09:48.240
is a powerfully influential television star who has a talk show watched by 100
million people. He uses the show as a battlefield to oppose corrupt elements of

09:48.240 --> 09:55.980
society. Spinrad comments on Barron's use of power. The book is about power.

09:56.340 --> 10:07.220
It's about power itself is neutral as far as I'm concerned. It's what people do
with it that counts. Barron is a guy who likes power and keeps referring to it

10:07.220 --> 10:17.340
as a drug. And knows that he can become addicted to it. And for that reason, has
decided to stay away from it. Then he gets drawn back into playing with power

10:17.340 --> 10:26.400
because he comes to the conclusion that it's better for somebody who feels that
way about power to be wielding it than people who don't have any self

10:26.400 --> 10:36.460
-consciousness about the dangers of wielding power. So in that sense, it's a
comment on the power of the media, but it's also a comment on the morality of

10:36.460 --> 10:47.800
power, on the paradox of power, which is that if you leave power to be wielded
to be wielded by people who do not see the dangers, the personal dangers, the

10:47.800 --> 10:57.820
psychological dangers of being involved with it, then you end up with people
like Benedict Howitz, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon, who do not have self

10:57.820 --> 11:06.160
-consciousness about the personal dangers, the moral dangers of chasing after
power. Whereas somebody like Barron, who is certainly an imperfect person, as

11:06.160 --> 11:19.620
all people are, at least his saving grace, if he has one, is that he is well
aware of the personal dangers of being involved in a quest for power. When

11:19.620 --> 11:26.380
Spinrad tried to get the novel published in this country, he was unsuccessful,
so he tried in Britain. But there was an outcry in Parliament against the book.

11:26.540 --> 11:35.500
He relates the story for us. That novel had a lot of trouble. It was written
under contract to Doubleday, who then rejected it. You know, you have to

11:35.500 --> 11:41.880
remember the political climate of the era. They didn't reject it. They said,
we'll publish it if you cut out all the sex, all the swear words, and all the

11:41.880 --> 11:52.980
politics, which was, you know, the whole book. So it took a long time to resell
that book here. In the meantime, I took it to Milford, to a Milford conference,

11:53.160 --> 11:59.620
and Mike Moorcock was there, and he read it, and he locked it, and he serialized
it in New World, so his first publication was actually in England, in the

11:59.620 --> 12:10.000
magazine. Now, halfway through the serialization, I forget exactly which part,
part three, part four, W. H. Smith, which was the biggest distributor, still is

12:10.000 --> 12:18.660
the biggest distributor in England, refused to distribute the magazine because
of the book in it. Now, at that time, New World had an Arts Council grant. The

12:18.660 --> 12:28.640
Arts Council was an organ of the British government. Now, the Arts Council
supported the magazine against Smith publicly, and so the flap in Parliament

12:28.640 --> 12:37.920
arose when certain right-wing members of Parliament were aghast that an organ of
the British government, the Arts Council, was defending this kind of stuff, and

12:37.920 --> 12:47.160
that's how it became a parliamentary issue. Bug Jack Barron is being made into a
movie, with a screenplay by Harlan Ellison and direction by radical filmmaker

12:47.160 --> 12:51.560
Costa Gavras. It should be interesting. More with Norman Spinrad next time.

12:58.720 --> 13:06.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

13:06.700 --> 13:07.460

13:48.180 --> 13:52.160
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.780
And here are your hosts.

14:22.340 --> 14:31.320
This is Daryl Lane. And David Crews. Norman Spinrad's 1979 science fiction novel,
A World Between, signaled a change in his fiction. Spinrad's early work usually

14:31.320 --> 14:39.720
contained either subtle or overt criticism of various aspects of society. Bug
Jack Baron, The Men in the Jungle, and Agent of Chaos are good examples of this

14:39.720 --> 14:51.760
type. A World Between is also a socially oriented novel, but there's a different
element in it. Spinrad explains. I would say in general that up until, I guess,

14:51.900 --> 15:02.960
A World Between, really, a lot of my stuff was kind of critical fiction,
critical of this, critical of existing societies, critical of various things

15:02.960 --> 15:14.060
that were going on. A World Between is meant as a utopian novel, really, in any
kind of way. And it's a prescriptive kind of book. It's more of a, instead of

15:14.060 --> 15:23.060
presenting critical images of other things, the idea is to create a more
positive image of a more positive kind of future. I think if you spend enough

15:23.060 --> 15:36.320
time criticizing what exists, at some point you have some kind of moral
obligation to present something more positive and replace what you find

15:36.320 --> 15:36.620
negative.

15:41.360 --> 15:49.100
The setting for the novel is a fit one for a utopia. It takes place on the
planet Pacifica, a beautiful world of blue ocean and lush green islands that's

15:49.100 --> 15:56.540
been colonized by humans. Inhabitants of Pacifica live private lives in their
isolated islands. There are no large urban centers to cause pollution,

15:56.720 --> 16:04.120
overpopulation, or poverty. Even though they are physically isolated, the
Pacificans remain in close electronic contact with one another. They govern

16:04.120 --> 16:11.940
themselves, in fact, with a tight media web that allows them to vote immediately
on any issue of importance. But into this idyllic world comes two opposed

16:11.940 --> 16:20.460
political forces from Earth, bent on the ideological conquest of Pacifica. One
force is the Institute for Transcendental Science, a powerful organization whose

16:20.460 --> 16:32.060
goal is galactic unity under their control. They are extreme, and Spinrad says
they have two basic flaws. One is the unexamined, subtle male chauvinist bias to

16:32.060 --> 16:44.440
their culture. And the other one is the ultimate conviction that what they are
doing is the absolute most important thing in the universe, and that therefore

16:44.440 --> 17:00.020
they are morally entitled to run over other people's cultures and desires.
Absolutism, I guess, would be the, even the kind of theocratic absolutism, would

17:00.020 --> 17:08.840
be their flaw. The other force is the Femocrats, a militant women's liberation
group that is also an extreme. The struggle of these two groups for control of

17:08.840 --> 17:16.440
planets all across the galaxy is called the Pink and Blue War. It's clearly a
male-female conflict, and so far every planet the two sides have approached has

17:16.440 --> 17:25.400
ended up on one side or the other. But Pacifica is different. Spinrad's utopia
is a stable and intelligent one. The Pacificans reject both extremes and even

17:25.400 --> 17:32.780
change the minds of a few of the combatants. We asked Spinrad about reactions to
the book. How did women, for instance, respond to the Femocratic women's livers?

17:33.980 --> 17:47.840
The strange thing about the reaction to that book has been that a certain number
of men have reacted in a kind of male liberal guilt, male feminist kind of

17:47.840 --> 17:57.960
reaction against that. For the most part, women have liked the book. Women have
identified with it more than men. And actually, I even got one or two good

17:57.960 --> 18:06.800
reviews in feminist places. I think that's not quite what I expected, but that
seems to be the way it happened. I have not gotten heavy feminist flack from

18:06.800 --> 18:16.760
that. A little bit, but not much. Not much, because I think women who are
involved in feminism, or have been, or know women who are, can recognize a

18:16.760 --> 18:26.320
certain aspect of the feminist movement in the Femocrats. Whereas men who are
trying to show how liberated they are would not dream of admitting such a thing.

18:26.320 --> 18:31.560
A World Between. A different sort of book for Norman Spinrad. And we'll have
more on him tomorrow.

18:38.860 --> 18:46.700

This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.960
And here are your hosts.

20:01.960 --> 20:10.920
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. Norman Spinrad's most recent novel, Songs
from the Stars, was published by Simon & Schuster in 1980. The book describes a

20:10.920 --> 20:18.900
fragmented future society in a world devastated by nuclear war. This, of course,
is a typical Spinrad theme. But the novel also communicates the sense of wonder

20:18.900 --> 20:27.020
characteristic of good science fiction when it describes the marvels of contact
with an alien civilization. Society is split in two factions in Songs from the

20:27.020 --> 20:34.800
Stars. One faction is an Aquarian society which bans all technology, in fact
anything having to do with science, since this was what was responsible for

20:34.800 --> 20:42.280
almost destroying the Earth. And the other faction are the black scientists who
keep technology alive and maintain an illicit smuggling operation with the

20:42.280 --> 20:51.960
Aquarian society. Spinrad talks about these opposed factions. It's a book
against duality. I mean, you have two fragmented societies. They're both...

20:54.840 --> 21:05.920
Both are kind of like half-societies. So the Aquarian society there is a very
nice thing that works, except it really only works because it accepts something

21:05.920 --> 21:17.300
from the black scientists, which it doesn't want to admit that it's accepted.
And the black scientists are, again, another kind of absolutism, which

21:17.300 --> 21:20.860
doesn't...

21:20.860 --> 21:32.620
So it's a kind of a... It's a book about higher unity, I guess. As usual, with
Spinrad, the book's conflict reflects current social conditions. And then, you

21:32.620 --> 21:40.220
know, it mirrors the present thing in our society, where on the one hand you
have a great big space movement and people wanting to get into space and all the

21:40.220 --> 21:49.660
old people and all that stuff. On the other hand, you have a real atavistic neo
-Luddite movement, an anti-nuclear movement, which is really kind of willfully

21:49.660 --> 21:56.780
ignorant of a lot of things. In a way, these are the two things that could bring
about the crash.

21:59.940 --> 22:10.120
And... As well as what would survive it. So I think it's basically a book
about... The grand philosophical attempt of that book is to try and bridge the

22:10.120 --> 22:22.540
gap between science and reason and, you know, feeling, emotion, and mysticism.
And to... You know, to point to a higher unity between the two things and away

22:22.540 --> 22:31.160
from the false dichotomies and false dualisms, would seem to be really
destroying Western civilization. That's a long statement. The protagonist in the

22:31.160 --> 22:38.660
book is a laid-back Aquarian, Clear Blue Lou. Along with his girl and a
scientist, he travels up to a satellite circling the Earth. There, the three of

22:38.660 --> 22:46.560
them receive communication from some incredibly advanced alien civilizations in
another part of the galaxy. With the knowledge sent by the helpful aliens, it

22:46.560 --> 22:54.080
seems that humans will solve their own problems, unite, and start progressing
toward the stars once more. We asked Spinrad that if and when we contact an

22:54.080 --> 23:04.960
alien civilization, is it likely they will be helpful rather than hostile? As I
said in the book, I do believe that any civilization that's going to last a

23:04.960 --> 23:11.380
million years, it's going to be a million years or whatever, or even a hundred
thousand years more advanced than us, that have been around that much longer,

23:11.700 --> 23:20.640
that much more advanced science. If it's going to survive to that length of its
own history, it's got to solve it, you know, it's got to be, by that time,

23:21.880 --> 23:30.900
philosophically and emotionally pretty together or long since it destroyed
itself. I mean, we certainly will not survive a million years of our own history

23:30.900 --> 23:39.440
if it continues as it has, you know. In order that any civilization that
survives a million years of its own history has had to have gotten its

23:39.440 --> 23:53.200
political, psychological, and philosophical act together. And I don't see why,
you know. Yeah, and I do believe that if and when we run into that kind of

23:53.200 --> 24:02.760
really advanced civilizations, that they will, if not be directly actively
helpful, certainly will be benign and will not be interested in either eating us

24:02.760 --> 24:12.000
or conquering our planet or blowing us up or anything like that. Songs from the
Stars is a thoughtfully written book with a theme, but it's also good, exciting

24:12.000 --> 24:12.680
science fiction.

This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. James P. Hogan's latest novel, Voyage from
Yesteryear, is a fascinating blend of computers, space exploration, and genetic

25:54.760 --> 26:01.720
engineering. It's about a robot probe that discovers a habitable planet ten
light years from Earth, but it's different than the usual probe imagined by

26:01.720 --> 26:10.840
science fiction authors. Right. This one is equipped to manufacture human
beings. Hogan explains. We read a lot of stories about starships that go on long

26:10.840 --> 26:20.820
voyages that take maybe centuries, and inevitably they've got frozen bodies or
bodies in suspended animation or something like that. But when you think about

26:20.820 --> 26:28.360
it, it seems rather an inefficient way to send, you know, if they're not doing
anything, the machines can fly the ship, the computers can get it there. The

26:28.360 --> 26:38.040
people aren't doing anything about it except, you know, just lying there
freezing. So, you know, why not let the machines fly the ship and make the

26:38.040 --> 26:48.940
people when you get there? If we look at the progress made in molecular biology
and genetic engineering in the last couple of decades, we already manufacture

26:48.940 --> 26:58.100
quite complex organic molecules to specifications, such as drugs and certain
anesthetics. If we just extrapolate that a little further, who's to say you

26:58.100 --> 27:07.080
couldn't make a complete set of human DNA? In other words, instead of sending
bodies and all the support equipment to freeze them and taking up all the space,

27:07.240 --> 27:11.840
why not just store

27:11.840 --> 27:25.300
all the genetic information necessary to make people electronically in the
computers and create them when you have found a planet that the instruments say

27:25.300 --> 27:33.880
they could survive on? So the computers make a race of humans, raise them, and
place them on the planet. It sounds a bit mechanical, a little inhuman perhaps,

27:34.200 --> 27:48.780
but Hogan thinks it could work out beautifully. So here is the interesting
possibility of a race that evolves from a first generation of embryos that were

27:48.780 --> 27:59.960
created and nurtured and raised by computers and robots, a machine-raised race.
And when you think about it, the relationship between the children and the

27:59.960 --> 28:10.340
machines does not really have to be a cold and sinister one at all. It could be
quite a charming and amusing one. The interesting thoughts that the book starts

28:10.340 --> 28:17.300
to play with is, here is a race of kids that are being raised by some

28:17.300 --> 28:29.880
very rational, direct, down-to-earth entities who don't double-talk or deceive
or have all these layers of human game-playing that we have to contend with. And

28:29.880 --> 28:35.920
they're being raised completely without

28:35.920 --> 28:48.580
any exposure to the conditioning of conditioned adults with their prejudices and
hatreds and taboos and a lot of the other nonsenses that make life so

28:48.580 --> 28:58.160
complicated in our society. As you might expect, these machine-raised humans are
eventually contacted by humans from Earth. Let's imagine that a mission from

28:58.160 --> 28:59.620
Earth eventually shows up.

29:02.740 --> 29:12.640
Virtually, you know, a big mission. This is usually a 20-year voyage, maybe. So
we're talking about a spaceship that maybe houses 20,000 people, virtually a

29:12.640 --> 29:22.060
space colony with engines, with its government, its military, its church
organizations, its commercial institutions. The whole of society in miniature

29:22.060 --> 29:38.040
with its time-proved mechanisms for controlling and subordinating a population.
Which traditionally, a ruling elite through history has imposed itself by

29:38.040 --> 29:49.500
restricting the flow of wealth and by offering protection either from real or
imagined threats. And so what happens when a race of machine-raised people

29:49.500 --> 29:58.280
eventually collides with a race of people-raised people? And that's really what
the story's all about. The Voyage from Yesteryear will be out in paperback at

29:58.280 --> 30:01.980
the end of July. Next week we'll have a series of shows on the works of James B.
Hogan.

30:08.960 --> 30:16.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

30:16.780 --> 30:21.200
Odessa, Texas.
