00:01.220 --> 00:04.660
Just a brief statement on how you became a professional writer, the background that led

00:04.660 --> 00:05.080
you to it?

00:05.840 --> 00:09.780
Well, it's everybody's story is a long story.

00:11.200 --> 00:16.100
It's much easier for other people to summarize you than it is for you to summarize yourself.

00:16.500 --> 00:22.820
I conceived in college the ambition to be a professional writer of fiction.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.780
It was a number of years before I stumbled into writing fantasy.

00:26.780 --> 00:33.240
And that was a crucial thing for me because my writing got a great deal better when I

00:33.240 --> 00:34.140
started to write fantasy.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.560
But that had been about eight years.

00:39.220 --> 00:43.020
I had been writing as hard as I knew how for eight years before I started on fantasy.

00:43.700 --> 00:48.260
And from the time I started writing fantasy until I finally achieved a publication of

00:48.260 --> 00:50.680
some kind was another five years.

00:51.560 --> 00:59.820
So, I had a 13 year apprenticeship in a sense and then it's been only since then that I've

00:59.820 --> 01:01.400
been able to support myself as a writer.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.420
Did you grow up reading science fiction and fantasy?

01:05.020 --> 01:06.160
Well, actually no.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.620
Not for any other reason than in terms of what I call a historical accident.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.820
I was living in India because my parents were medical missionaries to India and we simply

01:15.820 --> 01:18.160
got on a very erratic supply of books.

01:18.540 --> 01:23.680
There was no one particular kind of thing that we got except mystery novels.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.020
Missionaries love to read mystery novels.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.220
I don't know quite why that is.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.100
But other than that, it was a random sampling of everything.

01:31.340 --> 01:38.020
I read Leon Urus and the Hardy Boys at the same time and I read Bomba the Jungle Boy

01:38.020 --> 01:43.100
and I read James Mitchell and a whole range of things, whatever I could get my hands on.

01:43.820 --> 01:49.680
Now, I loved every science fiction novel that I got my hands on, of which I can remember

01:49.680 --> 01:50.300
every one.

01:51.020 --> 01:53.100
There were three.

01:53.820 --> 01:56.480
I read three by the time I was a high school graduate.

01:57.060 --> 02:00.100
One was Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.700
One was A.J.

02:01.880 --> 02:06.000
Budri's Rogue Moon and one was Theodore Sturgeon's More Than Human.

02:07.180 --> 02:12.640
Now, it's just an accident that I happened to get to read three classics in the only

02:12.640 --> 02:14.240
three science fiction books I read.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.640
They made a great impression on me but that was all there was.

02:19.480 --> 02:24.460
Now, I came to the United States at the end of my high school days to start college and

02:24.460 --> 02:26.100
I wanted to read more science fiction.

02:26.740 --> 02:31.480
But I didn't know any people who read it so I didn't know any place to get information

02:31.480 --> 02:35.540
about what was worth reading and what I would do was wander into a drug store and pick up

02:35.540 --> 02:36.360
science fiction books.

02:37.780 --> 02:40.920
And you can get some remarkably bad books doing that.

02:41.480 --> 02:45.580
And the things that I picked up in the first couple of years in drug stores were so terrible

02:45.580 --> 02:47.320
that I stopped reading science fiction.

02:48.880 --> 02:53.540
And in fact, I didn't start reading science fiction again until I was finally in a position

02:53.540 --> 02:59.540
where I knew people who could make recommendations that had to separate out the real garbage

02:59.540 --> 03:00.500
from the good stuff.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.920
Were the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the first Chronicles?

03:09.360 --> 03:10.420
Was that your first published work?

03:10.960 --> 03:11.080
Yes.

03:11.740 --> 03:16.160
Well, actually I had a couple of letters to the editor published in the Avengers comic

03:16.160 --> 03:21.340
books back in the late 60s but that was the only other time my name was in print.

03:22.220 --> 03:25.160
I heard you talk about this, I think it was yesterday.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.620
You didn't have a lot of trouble getting that accepted.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.840
I had a great deal of trouble getting my break.

03:32.540 --> 03:38.320
Lord Files Bain was rejected by every fiction publisher in the United States and also by

03:38.320 --> 03:42.460
all the magazines that did serializations at that time and also by several agents.

03:42.700 --> 03:46.860
By the time I had finished having that book rejected, it had been rejected 47 times.

03:47.340 --> 03:50.260
It took three and a half years or so for me to do that.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.500
It was a very difficult process.

03:55.320 --> 03:59.440
In a lot of ways I was saved by happenstance.

04:01.700 --> 04:06.880
I went through the alphabet from A to Z with publishers and when I got to Z, I didn't know

04:06.880 --> 04:07.420
what else to do.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.680
I thought that it might work if I tried to send my book to British publishers.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.800
I mean, I didn't have anywhere else to turn at that point.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.280
So I sent away for a directory of British publishing so that I could begin going from

04:21.280 --> 04:22.080
A to Z in England.

04:22.080 --> 04:26.500
And while I was waiting for that book to come, I just couldn't bear to let my manuscript

04:26.500 --> 04:26.900
sit.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.900
So I resubmitted it to Valentine books.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.340
And the only reason I did that was because they published Lord of the Rings, which meant

04:38.340 --> 04:40.360
to me that they were a profitable company.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.620
If they were making some money, they had at least a slightly better chance that they'd

04:45.620 --> 04:46.980
take a wing on somebody like me.

04:47.980 --> 04:53.240
What I did not know was that since the last time I had submitted my book to Valentine,

04:53.500 --> 04:56.260
they had fired their entire editorial staff and had all new people.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.280
And essentially what they had was Lester and Judy Lynn Delray.

05:00.020 --> 05:03.440
And the Delray's jumped on Lord Fellsbane as soon as they got it.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.460
They knew almost immediately that they wanted to publish this material.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.540
It changed my life.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.260
But up until then it was an extremely difficult process.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.380
Okay, just one unfair question.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.320
I'm sure it's too general to be a really fair one.

05:21.480 --> 05:25.340
But was there a particular impetus behind that novel?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.040
Well, that is pretty general.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.860
I don't know what kind of impetus you're talking about.

05:31.500 --> 05:36.140
When you started to write, was there something in your mind that said, I want to write a

05:36.140 --> 05:39.360
novel of this type about Thomas Covenant, who's a leper and so forth?

05:39.980 --> 05:45.020
Well, there's the key thing for me about the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant was that

05:45.020 --> 05:48.780
my inspiration for it came from the end.

05:48.900 --> 05:52.900
The first idea that occurred for me for that book was for the climax of the power that preserves.

05:53.720 --> 06:01.160
Now, when I got a story going, I had an entire story ready to tell.

06:01.300 --> 06:06.780
And from that point of view, the impetus that got me going on Lord Fellsbane was the climax

06:06.780 --> 06:07.960
of the power that preserves.

06:07.960 --> 06:13.380
And that has been my pattern in all the Covenant books is that I have worked them all backwards.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.700
I mean, I don't write them backwards, but I plan them and arrange them backwards.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.640
The thing that inspires me to write the story comes at the end.

06:22.100 --> 06:30.000
So for the second Chronicles, it was the climax of White Goldweilder that convinced me that I wanted to write a second Chronicles.

06:30.460 --> 06:37.940
And essentially my method is that I have this climactic scene in mind and I have to add it to the story.

06:37.960 --> 06:42.080
And so the simple questions like who are these guys and how did they get into this mess?

06:42.720 --> 06:44.800
And I plan backwards on that basis.

06:44.980 --> 06:48.160
Well, in order for that to happen, these things must have happened first.

06:48.400 --> 06:53.860
And if those things must have happened first, then these kinds of people must have been doing those kinds of things.

06:54.640 --> 06:59.400
And I arrange everything backwards until I get to a point where I can start writing.

07:00.640 --> 07:05.480
Which means that the one thing that's absolutely clear to me the whole time when I'm working on these things,

07:05.500 --> 07:06.320
I know where I'm going.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.680
I know exactly what the purpose of all these events is.

07:09.900 --> 07:17.340
It's going to produce that result which you as a reader will finally come to at the end of 1500 pages or whatever.

07:19.280 --> 07:30.780
And in the case of the first Chronicles, it was that climactic scene where Thomas Covenant, who has been rejecting the importance of his fantasy experience,

07:30.960 --> 07:32.980
comes face to face with Lord Fowle.

07:32.980 --> 07:48.600
And the fact that he disbelieves in some way in the reality of the fantasy gives him the emotional power to not be crushed by Lord Fowle.

07:48.680 --> 07:56.780
He knows he doesn't need to be overwhelmed by evil because he denies its external reality.

07:56.780 --> 08:04.140
He knows there's evil in him, but he doesn't have to be overwhelmed by this externalization of evil.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.940
And that makes it possible for him to win.

08:06.920 --> 08:12.100
Well, I knew that was where I was going the entire time I worked on the first trilogy.

08:17.740 --> 08:24.880
I think in one of your glossaries at the end of one of the books, you had the land, you had it defined as a focal region of the earth.

08:25.480 --> 08:25.880
Yeah.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.800
You didn't have a particular spot or a where that the land is supposed to be located.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.440
Well, I know it's on a globe.

08:35.160 --> 08:45.460
You know, I mean, this is a world and the land is only, obviously, it's only a small continental portion of an entire world.

08:45.660 --> 08:49.120
When you get into the second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant and people start voyaging around,

08:49.120 --> 08:54.840
you at least get some sense that there are lots of other things going on in the world too.

08:55.560 --> 09:04.020
My perception of it is that the land is kind of like the arena in which the crucial issues for the whole world are fought out.

09:04.480 --> 09:11.300
And although they have amplifications and ramifications which affect events in other parts of the world

09:11.300 --> 09:15.280
and different things happen maybe because of what's happening in the land,

09:15.280 --> 09:18.660
but that everything focuses there.

09:20.320 --> 09:24.060
Now, this is a subtle question in some ways and it's crucial in others.

09:24.460 --> 09:31.600
In the one tree, the character is the Elohim who consider themselves to be very God-like, if not God itself.

09:33.660 --> 09:37.360
One problem for them is that the crucial events are happening somewhere else.

09:37.460 --> 09:43.300
They think, I mean, obviously, since we're crucial, if what's happening to you were really important, it would have been happening here instead of way over there.

09:44.260 --> 09:52.960
And that leads them into some decisions of questionable ethics.

09:53.640 --> 10:02.240
But for the thrust of the Covenant books as a whole, it is certainly true that the land is where the main battles are being fought.

10:02.940 --> 10:06.880
And other stuff feeds into that but is not central.

10:08.320 --> 10:13.720
A Covenant, at least in my experience with fantasy, I imagine for a lot of readers too,

10:14.220 --> 10:21.500
a Covenant is sort of an anti-hero, you know, being a leper for one reason, but also being a, doesn't want to be a hero in the first place.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.660
Why pick somebody that was not in the traditional?

10:25.940 --> 10:33.380
Well, for one thing, you know, I mean, I wasn't aware of the tradition. I had read Lord of the Rings, but other than that, I hadn't read much fantasy myself.

10:34.400 --> 10:38.880
So I wasn't making a conscious decision to go for or against anything normal.

10:39.060 --> 10:43.840
I was just trying to deal with something that seemed to me to be exciting and appropriate.

10:45.020 --> 10:50.360
Now, for me, the story started with the climax of the power that preserves.

10:50.520 --> 10:55.780
I have an unbeliever confronting the evil principle and rising above it.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.460
Well, I had that idea in my head for like three years before I ever had it.

11:00.460 --> 11:04.100
Before I could figure out who those guys were and how they got into that mess.

11:04.660 --> 11:09.480
That original idea, though it was very powerful to me, was also static. There was no story attached.

11:11.440 --> 11:21.460
I got a story when it occurred to me that the person who is going to go from the real world to the fantasy world and reject the fantasy world in favor of the real world

11:21.460 --> 11:27.920
should be somebody whose real world is unbearable and whose fantasy world is terrific.

11:28.980 --> 11:35.480
I mean, look at it the other way around. Suppose you have a terrific real life and you have these rotten fantasies.

11:36.840 --> 11:42.320
If you then say, I don't care about the fantasy, I'm going to stick with reality, what does that mean?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.860
You know, I mean, you just, that's normal self-interest.

11:46.160 --> 11:53.100
Anybody who has a terrible time in their nightmares and a wonderful time in the rest of their life is going to prefer the rest of their life.

11:53.920 --> 12:00.460
It only becomes a moral statement when you have somebody who really hates their life because their life is terrible.

12:02.280 --> 12:10.220
And their dreams are just wonderful and they still say, I'm going to reject the dream because I know the difference and even though reality is terrible,

12:10.500 --> 12:12.800
I'm going to still affirm reality.

12:14.000 --> 12:21.340
Now that may seem a little unbalanced or crazy to some people, but it is a moral statement of some kind because there's no self-interest in it.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.520
It's not something that you do to make yourself feel better.

12:24.620 --> 12:28.620
It's something that you do as an ideal or as a belief, a religious belief.

12:31.060 --> 12:33.920
And of course, whose real life could be lousier than a leper's.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.260
Now as soon as I thought of that, then I had a story.

12:37.980 --> 12:43.700
I had a fantasy world because all I had to do was invent a fantasy world that is the direct opposite of being a leper.

12:45.620 --> 12:50.220
And I had, you know, everything fell into place for me as soon as I thought of that kind of thing.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.120
I never intended that as an anti-hero kind of situation.

12:54.800 --> 13:00.180
From my point of view, the only thing that makes Covenant an anti-hero is that he doesn't want to be a hero.

13:00.420 --> 13:01.760
He's afraid of being a hero.

13:03.400 --> 13:10.260
But he is a hero from my point of view and I think most of my readers eventually get sucked into the point, even though they don't like him in the beginning.

13:10.840 --> 13:16.740
First they start to admit that he's got some reasons for what he does and then they start grudgingly to respect what he's doing.

13:16.740 --> 13:21.680
And before you know it, people end up liking him and identifying with him as if he were a normal hero.

13:22.860 --> 13:24.440
And that's certainly the way it is for me.

13:24.800 --> 13:34.240
I cared a lot about this character from the very beginning and I never worked with him as something that I would call anti-anything.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.020
I knew he was having a tough time.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.160
I know it was rotten to be in the position that he was in.

13:39.160 --> 13:46.720
And I knew from various kinds of studies and research what sorts of psychological problems people who suffer from.

13:46.740 --> 13:55.140
You know, what does it feel like to be despised by everybody around you for something that has nothing to do with what you did or didn't do?

13:55.620 --> 13:57.360
You just got this disease.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.200
You don't know why everybody hates you.

13:59.740 --> 14:03.880
That exerts a tremendous psychological stress and it doesn't make people beautiful.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.300
You don't become a nice guy just because you got leprosy.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.460
The pressure brings any kind of pressure.

14:10.860 --> 14:14.060
Brings out the flaws in human nature.

14:14.900 --> 14:19.500
That's where you find out that there are areas where you're weak and areas where you're not very graceful.

14:19.580 --> 14:25.100
It's when somebody puts a lot of pressure on you and you start to get a little nasty and you start to get a little impatient.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.700
You start to do this and start to do that.

14:27.760 --> 14:33.540
It seemed obvious to me, particularly at the beginning, that Copford is under tremendous psychological and emotional pressure.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.420
And he's not going to be a very likable guy.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.480
But what's going to happen, and of course I knew this all along,

14:39.480 --> 14:43.100
what's going to happen is that in the course of Coppins with this dilemma,

14:43.440 --> 14:49.500
he was going to essentially reintegrate his whole personality and become a constructive individual

14:49.500 --> 14:55.200
who does know what he cares about and who does love other people and who is willing to fight for that.

14:56.420 --> 14:59.600
So from my point of view, there was never any identification problem.

14:59.820 --> 15:03.060
I identified with him a lot from the beginning.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.700
For a reader, it's different.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.200
A reader doesn't know where I'm going.

15:06.660 --> 15:10.100
And so they have to kind of evaluate things as it goes along.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.960
And for many readers, in the beginning, Covenant is just very obnoxious.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.740
Then later they learn to kind of understand him a bit.

15:17.500 --> 15:25.720
I guess to me, one of the paradoxes, I guess it's a paradox, all six volumes is based upon is the idea that

15:26.460 --> 15:31.400
Covenant's power, his ability to combat despite Lord Fowler, is simply the fact that he is a leper

15:31.400 --> 15:34.860
and does have such a lousy life in the real world.

15:34.860 --> 15:35.720
That gives him a strength.

15:36.180 --> 15:38.520
Yeah, it gives him an emotional strength.

15:41.960 --> 15:48.740
What passes for magic in the Covenant books really is just an external expression of personality.

15:50.540 --> 15:56.020
The strength for magic always comes from inside the individual in this kind of world.

15:56.440 --> 16:03.320
And what creates emotional strength is what makes magic like Lord Morum

16:03.320 --> 16:08.160
who in the first Chronicles becomes the strongest of the Lords,

16:08.720 --> 16:11.940
really and does something that nobody else has been able to do in the end

16:11.940 --> 16:15.440
when he kills the giant raver that's attacking them.

16:16.980 --> 16:19.280
What's really an issue for there is emotional strength.

16:21.020 --> 16:23.680
It's not that you know more than somebody else does.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.860
You know more spells than somebody else does.

16:25.920 --> 16:31.660
Or you've studied a different book of Arcana and have learned different kinds of magic or anything else.

16:31.660 --> 16:34.720
In this kind of world magic doesn't hinge on that sort of thing.

16:34.860 --> 16:38.480
It hinges on the strengths and weaknesses of your own personality.

16:39.040 --> 16:46.040
And that's where the danger comes from of course because people who have that susceptibility to pressure

16:46.040 --> 16:51.660
to where like Kevin they crack when things get too bad, then they fall into despair

16:51.660 --> 16:54.620
and you get the same people who perform the ritual of desecration.

16:56.160 --> 17:01.540
The key issue is the personality of the person who has the power

17:01.540 --> 17:03.020
or their personality structure.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.240
You know how strong or how weak they are.

17:07.100 --> 17:12.620
And what Covenant becomes over the course of these six books

17:12.620 --> 17:15.420
is this incredibly strong personality.

17:16.540 --> 17:21.200
And eventually he becomes such a strong personality that in certain ways he doesn't need magic anymore.

17:21.200 --> 17:26.680
You'll find this when you've read through to the end of White Goldwilder

17:26.680 --> 17:32.220
that he dominates situations without using magic anymore

17:32.220 --> 17:41.160
because he has become such a strong structure internally, emotionally.

17:42.660 --> 17:48.760
I imagine one of the joys of being a fantasy writer is in naming things.

17:48.760 --> 17:53.160
And I've always been impressed with the way you pick names for things.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.580
And I wondered if that was something that comes naturally to you or you work at it?

17:57.680 --> 18:00.380
Well I'm always a little embarrassed because traditionally,

18:01.380 --> 18:07.160
I mean if you assume that tradition is Tolkien, then there's really a background for names.

18:07.400 --> 18:11.200
Certainly in Tolkien there is he involved an entire language of Elvish

18:11.200 --> 18:17.800
and worked out immensely elaborate structures which back up the names.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.760
And I have never been able to do that.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.900
As a matter of fact I have trouble with foreign languages of any kind

18:23.900 --> 18:27.580
and became that close to flunking college German and stuff.

18:28.760 --> 18:32.820
I do it by ear. It's a very much an intuitive kind of process for me.

18:33.480 --> 18:39.080
Now there are situations in which I beg, borrow or steal words

18:39.080 --> 18:41.520
that mean something that I use for names.

18:41.960 --> 18:46.000
Like for example all the names of the ravers

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
are words that have meaning.

18:49.740 --> 18:52.660
And I use those words because they mean something

18:53.280 --> 19:00.180
but also because those words have the right sound to my ear for what I want.

19:00.700 --> 19:04.240
So in those situations the name has to meet two criteria

19:04.240 --> 19:07.420
and the meaning has to be appropriate and it still has to sound right.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.460
Other than that I do it by sound.

19:10.660 --> 19:15.180
Certain kinds of combinations of sounds and whatnot sound good and strong and positive to me

19:15.180 --> 19:19.560
and they sound like good guys and other combinations of sounds sound like bad guys.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.560
You know I make it up.

19:24.980 --> 19:27.400
Now I try to make it up consistently obviously.

19:27.680 --> 19:33.280
Now for the example all the giants have names which are combinations of normal words.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.900
Salt, heart, foam, follower.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.500
You know those are all English words and you just string them together.

19:40.220 --> 19:43.180
So obviously when I'm making up names for my characters

19:43.180 --> 19:46.500
I'm not going to make up that kind of name for one giant

19:46.500 --> 19:51.180
and then make up a completely different, nonsense syllable kind of name for another giant.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.140
All the giants have the same kind of names.

19:54.340 --> 20:01.420
As it happens the ramen, the people in the first trilogy who work with the horses

20:02.100 --> 20:07.580
they all have names based on Indian words that I knew when I was a kid growing up in India.

20:07.660 --> 20:11.520
I just needed some sort of principle to help me pull it together

20:11.520 --> 20:14.760
so that I'm sure I'd be consistent about that name.

20:14.860 --> 20:18.320
So all those people have names that are based on Indian words.

20:20.460 --> 20:23.920
The blood guard and the Hiruchai all have names of a certain.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.740
Sometimes they have two syllables more often than not their one syllable words.

20:27.940 --> 20:34.240
You know brin, kale, kire, you know and they're all words that seem to me to be...

20:34.240 --> 20:36.520
They're full of consonants. They're fairly strong sounding.

20:36.520 --> 20:41.660
But they're not words that would carry any direct meaning in English.

20:42.600 --> 20:47.300
So I follow patterns but I am doing it by ear.

20:48.100 --> 20:52.040
I would imagine too that the name Covenant has meaning doesn't it?

20:52.440 --> 20:55.640
Oh well of course. I'm a religious background and everything else.

20:55.700 --> 21:00.660
You can't use a word like that around me without it carrying all kinds of connotations.

21:01.800 --> 21:05.480
One of which in the religious tradition is simply the

21:06.920 --> 21:10.800
the whole question of the difference in God's relationship to man

21:10.800 --> 21:13.000
between the old Covenant and the new Covenant.

21:13.160 --> 21:17.660
The term Covenant is used to refer to a relationship or a deal

21:18.580 --> 21:19.640
between God and man.

21:20.520 --> 21:25.320
One of the things you'll notice in the first trilogy is that Covenant is always trying to make deals with the land.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.860
You know, I'll do this if you'll do that or if you don't ask me to do this

21:28.860 --> 21:30.500
I won't ask you to do that sort of thing.

21:32.380 --> 21:36.300
Every deal that he makes is seduces him a step further

21:36.300 --> 21:42.380
but they always fail because he's using them as substitutes for real commitment.

21:43.320 --> 21:48.000
In a biblical tradition the first Covenant, the old Covenant, was the Covenant of Law

21:48.000 --> 21:51.620
in which God gives you a bunch of rules to live by and if you live by those rules

21:51.620 --> 21:53.880
you're going to go to heaven and everybody will be happy.

21:54.620 --> 21:59.620
As opposed to the new Covenant, the Christ Covenant, which is the Covenant of Grace

21:59.620 --> 22:04.200
where essentially says, you know, okay, we found out you can't live by the rules after all

22:04.200 --> 22:06.200
but I still want to give you some way to get to heaven.

22:06.660 --> 22:12.380
So we'll have this sacrificial kind of act and you know, I'll send my son to die for your sins

22:12.380 --> 22:16.040
and you can be forgiven for not living according to the rules.

22:16.500 --> 22:21.520
And that brings up the question of law in relation to man and what law can mean.

22:22.320 --> 22:27.100
And of course, particularly in the first trilogy, law is a very important concept for the lords.

22:27.740 --> 22:30.580
They mean something different than a set of rules.

22:31.340 --> 22:32.860
But in a way it is a set of rules.

22:32.980 --> 22:40.720
For them, law is the way nature works and you have to live your life in service to the way nature works

22:40.720 --> 22:46.160
and in harmony with the way nature works and if you become a corruptive or destructive influence

22:46.160 --> 22:48.200
then you're going against law.

22:49.640 --> 22:55.200
So, I mean, the thematic implications run in all kinds of directions.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.160
The same thing is true, of course, for the name Thomas.

22:57.400 --> 23:01.140
Thomas was the disciple of Christ who doubted Christ's resurrection,

23:02.960 --> 23:08.020
who doubted the fundamental religious idea on which 2000 years of Christian history was going to be built.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.800
Well, covenant, Thomas covenant, my character, is a doubter of a certain kind of sin.

23:13.940 --> 23:19.940
He takes the really key point and rejects it for a while.

23:19.940 --> 23:28.400
And that allows me to imply various sorts of religious implications which I like working with.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.880
Throughout all the books you have references, of course, to this long background.

23:35.100 --> 23:39.320
People like Barry Caffé and Kevin Landwaster and the ritual of desecration.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.720
Things that occurred well in the past.

23:41.620 --> 23:46.040
Is this a scheme that you worked out so you're like in the manner of Tolkien, a whole scheme,

23:46.180 --> 23:47.740
and you're just telling one little portion of it?

23:47.740 --> 23:49.500
Not in the manner of Tolkien.

23:49.940 --> 23:56.860
Tolkien really did work out a grand scheme and a lot of it he worked out before he ever decided to write Lord of the Rings.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.320
Or the Hobbit.

23:58.960 --> 24:08.120
This was his hobby, in a sense, was evolving this history of the elves in the world.

24:08.860 --> 24:11.000
Of which Middle-Earth is only a small part.

24:12.480 --> 24:18.960
And eventually he got attracted to the idea of taking a small portion of this entire world history

24:18.960 --> 24:22.580
and trying to write it down for other people to read to see if they would enjoy it.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.880
Not so for me.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.760
I started with the climax of the power that preserves.

24:29.520 --> 24:34.020
And I evolved everything else to try to aim toward that end.

24:34.480 --> 24:40.980
So for me, people like Kevin and Barak and everything else were things that I made up to say.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.400
I set up the issues that I wanted to focus in on in the power that preserves.

24:45.420 --> 24:51.800
This is one reason that I can't write spin-off stories or secondary tales.

24:51.900 --> 24:56.720
You'll never hear a short story from me about what some giant did over somewhere else

24:56.720 --> 24:59.320
or the adventures of so and so hidden over here.

25:00.420 --> 25:01.900
My brain doesn't work that way.

25:01.960 --> 25:06.660
I only made this stuff up because it goes to that focal point that I'm aiming at,

25:06.740 --> 25:08.380
the climax of the power that preserves.

25:08.380 --> 25:12.640
And the stuff that I made up fits that.

25:12.860 --> 25:15.360
It serves the purpose for which I intended it.

25:15.580 --> 25:18.180
But in my mind, it doesn't have a life of its own.

25:18.440 --> 25:22.340
The way Tolkien's whole history background had a life of its own.

25:23.160 --> 25:28.220
And so I just, I mean, they'll never be the Donaldson equivalent of a Silmarillion.

25:30.240 --> 25:34.140
Because I haven't created any of that kind of material and I'm not likely to.

25:35.980 --> 25:41.040
I imagine a lot of your readers, as I did, probably responded to the giants very positively.

25:42.220 --> 25:43.060
Excuse me.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.300
That's okay, we edit those out.

25:44.620 --> 25:44.980
Good.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.800
I guess how do I want to phrase this?

25:51.560 --> 25:53.020
Where did you get the giants from?

25:53.400 --> 25:55.740
I mean, in mythology and in legend, usually bad guys.

25:56.860 --> 25:57.840
Well, I knew that.

25:58.080 --> 26:04.060
So when I was originally planning the story, I wanted to reverse that and to have giants

26:04.060 --> 26:04.800
who are good guys.

26:05.820 --> 26:07.220
But that was as far as it went.

26:08.020 --> 26:14.740
In any creative project of this size, there are some things that you can track down and explain very clearly.

26:14.980 --> 26:18.980
And that there's other things that seem to happen by serendipity.

26:19.100 --> 26:20.340
There's an element of discovery.

26:21.600 --> 26:26.820
In any creative act, you discover your own material.

26:27.300 --> 26:30.660
And that's balanced off by lots of other kinds of things that you do.

26:32.340 --> 26:35.300
I knew that I needed characters in the story.

26:35.420 --> 26:37.860
They were going to be, I was going to call them giants.

26:37.980 --> 26:39.000
They were going to do this and that.

26:39.220 --> 26:41.340
I knew what their function was going to be in the story.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.440
I knew what was going to happen.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.080
I knew names for them.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.180
But the fact is that when I started writing Lord of the Files,

26:48.300 --> 26:52.020
I didn't have any idea what their personality was like.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.280
I just hadn't figured that out.

26:57.940 --> 27:00.340
So my method in writing is very subjective.

27:00.520 --> 27:03.960
Essentially, I start looking at everything through the eyes of my characters

27:03.960 --> 27:06.440
and I just try to see what they see and feel what they're feeling.

27:08.460 --> 27:13.640
It's a self-hypnosis kind of writing where we try to eliminate Steve Donaldson from existence

27:13.640 --> 27:18.080
and I have to page ties right into whatever the ideas are and I just try to write.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.860
Of course, that means I have to do a lot of rewriting later.

27:23.540 --> 27:26.660
But at the time, it's very subjective. It's very experiential.

27:27.780 --> 27:32.200
And me, Covenant and Elena were standing on the banks of the Salzies.

27:32.300 --> 27:35.340
When I first met a giant, this boat was sailing up the river

27:35.340 --> 27:38.040
and I'm just sitting there at the typewriter watching the boat come up the river.

27:39.740 --> 27:41.520
I knew it was going to be a giant on board.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.260
As the author, I had that one advantage over Covenant and Elena.

27:44.380 --> 27:45.760
I knew it was going to be a giant on board.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.480
But I'm just typing along on the thing.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.540
So this is what he looks like and I'm just typing away.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.780
I'm just seeing him come up the river.

27:53.020 --> 27:57.920
It's like he's coming up the river, this being projected on a screen on the edge of the type desk or something.

27:58.780 --> 28:00.280
It was a real discovery for me.

28:00.320 --> 28:04.500
I found out before he started to talk and I think, oh, these are kind of a nice guy.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.680
When I started getting into storytelling and all this, oh boy, I love these giants.

28:08.840 --> 28:09.580
This is great stuff.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.800
I didn't premeditate any of that.

28:13.160 --> 28:16.820
It was a real discovery for me and a very happy discovery.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.680
I had a wonderful time meeting giants for the first time.

28:21.840 --> 28:28.320
And that, of course, shaped the whole context of finding out about their personality,

28:28.420 --> 28:32.880
really cast a lot of light over all the things that they were then going to do in the story.

28:34.380 --> 28:38.500
And there were some things that I had worked out that I was going to have happen in the story,

28:38.540 --> 28:41.200
which at the time seemed purely mechanical.

28:41.740 --> 28:48.360
For example, this question of the destruction of the unhomed in sea reach that takes place in the Ill-Earth War,

28:49.620 --> 28:53.660
where a raver goes and essentially knocks off all the living giants.

28:56.260 --> 28:57.060
Excuse me.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.060
Now, I planned that for purely practical reasons.

29:02.320 --> 29:07.740
I knew that if I were Lord Fowle and I really wanted to march out there with my armies and defeat the lords,

29:07.740 --> 29:13.660
the one thing I could never do would be to leave a party of giants sitting behind me to attack me from the rear,

29:13.740 --> 29:15.820
just when I thought I had the giants where I wanted them.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.120
I mean, the lords where I wanted them.

29:17.460 --> 29:18.420
It's just craziness.

29:18.540 --> 29:20.720
The giants are over here, the lords are over there,

29:20.820 --> 29:23.920
and if I go fight the lords, these giants are just going to come plowing into me,

29:23.940 --> 29:24.940
and I'm never going to be safe.

29:25.620 --> 29:30.160
The only good way to attack the lords is to take care of the giants first.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.120
And I just knew that Fowle was going to do that.

29:33.140 --> 29:34.840
That saves perfectly logical time.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.860
He is going to do something about those giants,

29:36.980 --> 29:38.560
and he's going to make it so that they can't fight.

29:40.360 --> 29:43.060
But that's a very mechanical kind of storytelling decision.

29:43.620 --> 29:44.840
And it is years away.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.260
Actually, from my point of view, I'm still writing Lord Fowle's Bane.

29:47.380 --> 29:48.840
That's coming up in the future.

29:49.500 --> 29:53.460
When I meet Saul Fohmfoller and start to find out what giants I really like,

29:54.020 --> 30:00.420
this suddenly then becomes a very important and also painful part of the story,

30:00.600 --> 30:03.540
because suddenly, you know, I fall in love with this entire race of people,

30:03.540 --> 30:06.320
and I realize I'm down the line, I'm going to have them all killed off.

30:08.080 --> 30:12.860
It becomes emotionally central to the whole story.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
It becomes one of the really difficult things that all of the characters have to deal with.

30:17.780 --> 30:25.160
And that discovery of Fohmfoller coming up the river just sheds light and implications

30:25.160 --> 30:28.860
down the whole path of the story into things that I could never have foreseen.

30:31.380 --> 30:33.500
Okay, I nearly answered this, but let me ask anyhow.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.500
You had always intended from the moment you started,

30:37.720 --> 30:40.920
you had this image at the end of the Power of the Preserves ending that you started with.

30:41.180 --> 30:43.060
You had the idea of writing six books.

30:44.180 --> 30:44.980
Two trilogies.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.340
No, well, I started with the ending of the Power of the Preserves.

30:47.480 --> 30:48.120
That's three books.

30:49.400 --> 30:54.220
What happened was that as I was finishing working on the Power of the Preserves,

30:54.900 --> 30:57.800
I became dissatisfied isn't the right word.

30:57.800 --> 31:02.320
I think the first trilogy is perfectly authentic and satisfactory on its own terms.

31:03.120 --> 31:08.500
But I became aware that evil is a much more complicated question than that.

31:08.540 --> 31:13.540
Essentially what happens in the first Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is the Hitler situation.

31:14.120 --> 31:17.000
Hitler comes along, he raises a big army, he wants to conquer the world.

31:17.700 --> 31:22.240
The only thing you can do is to raise a big army yourself and try and stop him.

31:23.000 --> 31:28.600
You know, and it turns out whoever can put out the best muscle in the field is going to be the one who wins.

31:30.580 --> 31:33.200
Now as it happens in the case of Hitler, the good guy's won.

31:33.360 --> 31:36.340
And as it happens in the case of the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the good guys win.

31:36.420 --> 31:39.220
But just because you have more muscle doesn't make you the good guy or the bad guy.

31:39.300 --> 31:39.940
It's just muscle.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.780
And at a certain level that's a fairly simple minded kind of thing.

31:45.500 --> 31:50.420
Evil comes in many different guys's and not all of them are that clear or that obvious.

31:50.420 --> 31:54.140
And in a lot of the cases muscle doesn't have anything to do with it.

31:54.720 --> 31:57.680
Muscle isn't going to do us any good when we got Richard Nixon for president.

31:58.120 --> 32:04.560
Because the kind of unscrupulous thing that Richard Nixon is doing is something to which muscle is an inappropriate response.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.420
You know, they just don't connect.

32:08.020 --> 32:13.540
And when Lord Fowler does things other than field armies, muscle is not the answer.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.960
Well I got to thinking about things like that while I was finishing work on the power that preserves.

32:19.580 --> 32:24.340
And got another hot flash for what then became the ending of White Goldwielder.

32:26.560 --> 32:30.380
For what would happen well, if evil doesn't do that, what would it do and how would it work?

32:30.480 --> 32:36.160
And I got this really exciting kind of vision of the climax of the power that preserves.

32:36.320 --> 32:44.080
And then I was back where I was before where I had to plan backward to figure out what the whole situation had been and how it had come about.

32:49.720 --> 32:55.600
Okay, I also know the answer to this because I heard your speeches but I still think it's possible for you to give a brief answer.

32:57.360 --> 33:03.520
One of the people that asked you a question, I forget which section it was, that at the end of the first trilogy you give us hope, the good guys win.

33:04.860 --> 33:11.160
Here we have the second one and all of a sudden that's not fair, you know, evil's still there, we didn't win after all.

33:13.360 --> 33:19.360
At the end of the first trilogy you give us hope but then you start all over again and take it away from us.

33:20.700 --> 33:21.100
Why?

33:22.600 --> 33:27.980
Well for one thing, if evil has been defeated, you know, what you're going to do for a second trilogy.

33:28.760 --> 33:35.120
I mean from a perfectly practical point of view, some of these things are necessary.

33:36.220 --> 33:39.740
But, you know, there are lots of different answers and one of them is just a matter of perspective.

33:40.220 --> 33:50.600
This whole time differential thing that occurs between Covenant's world and the land, much, much, much, much more time is passing in the land than is passing in Covenant's life.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.520
And for the land it's been three and a half thousand years.

33:54.060 --> 33:56.420
Now how big of victory does it have to be?

33:57.060 --> 34:02.200
The fact is that nothing in life is absolutely permanent.

34:02.200 --> 34:06.900
And Covenant's previous victory provided two thousand years of peace and happiness.

34:09.360 --> 34:12.500
You know, we can't get fifteen years out of World War II.

34:13.480 --> 34:21.240
You know, we go through all of that and by, you know, oh, six years later we're in Korea and, you know, what, twelve years after that we're in Vietnam.

34:22.540 --> 34:28.140
You know, for us, when we win in the real world, when we win a victory, you know, it lasts for minutes.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.540
Covenant's victory lasted a long time.

34:31.660 --> 34:34.940
It is just not reasonable that that would last forever.

34:35.700 --> 34:40.500
In addition to that, I tried to make it clear in the first trilogy that Covenant was not killing Lord Fowle.

34:41.140 --> 34:49.140
You can't kill despite, because in the final analysis, despite is part of what it means to be human and you can't exterminate your own personality.

34:50.920 --> 34:55.180
What he does is masters it, in a sense, in the first trilogy.

34:56.560 --> 35:00.520
Defuses it for a while and, you know, like taking the venom out of snake fangs or something like that.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.980
Life becomes safe for a while, but it's just as sure as death and taxes.

35:05.740 --> 35:08.720
You know, this stuff is going to go back and it seems perfectly reasonable.

35:09.660 --> 35:12.860
Of course, from a reader's point of view, you know, Covenant, it's ten years.

35:13.380 --> 35:17.820
For a reader's point of view, it may very well have been five minutes since they finished reading The Power That Preserves.

35:17.820 --> 35:21.020
They pick up the wounded land and they find everything's going to hell in a handbasket.

35:21.100 --> 35:23.020
Essentially, what I've done is I've nuked the land.

35:24.320 --> 35:28.220
You know, so I can understand that for a reader, this can be a real shock.

35:29.180 --> 35:35.800
You have this victory at the end of The Power That Preserves and it's not, in some ways, it's not a very dramatic victory.

35:35.960 --> 35:41.040
Now, what I mean is that there's not a lot of emotional fanfare attached to the victory.

35:41.300 --> 35:43.480
You know, they don't have tick or tape parades.

35:43.480 --> 35:47.380
You know, they don't spend the way they do in Lord of the Rings.

35:47.460 --> 35:52.240
They don't spend fifty pages explaining what happened to everybody after the victory.

35:52.580 --> 35:57.740
They don't, you know, Covenant doesn't go back to Lord Morim and they don't fall on each other's arms and shake hands

35:57.740 --> 36:00.980
and given a feast and drink a bunch of toasts and all this other kind of stuff.

36:01.180 --> 36:02.300
There's not a lot of validation.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.080
Covenant wins. The land is safe. That's the end of the story.

36:06.620 --> 36:10.500
You know, Covenant wakes up in a hospital bed and smiles and decides it's okay to go on living.

36:10.500 --> 36:15.840
And then you go from there bingo-bango and, you know, from fictional terms it's ten years.

36:15.980 --> 36:19.260
From the reader's point of view it's five minutes and everything's been destroyed.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.660
You know, that's tough and I appreciate the position that puts a reader in.

36:23.900 --> 36:28.660
But you have to realize that from my position, it's a very natural storytelling development.

36:30.020 --> 36:32.480
And without it, there wouldn't be a story for me to tell.

36:34.660 --> 36:40.320
Okay, listen, how are we doing on time? I could talk for hours on this. I don't want to take too much of your time, are we?

36:41.040 --> 36:45.240
Well, that's pretty much up to you. I'll like and go on for another ten or fifteen minutes anyway.

36:45.380 --> 36:46.120
That's what I need if you could.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.620
Okay, thank you.

36:51.780 --> 36:56.120
The choice of white gold, I think it was in the one tree one of the, maybe it was said elsewhere,

36:56.200 --> 37:02.280
one of the characters says that white gold exists only in Covenant's ring, that it's a natural alliance of metals.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.540
Why did you choose that as your...

37:04.540 --> 37:09.540
Well, precisely because it is an alliance of metals. You're never going to find white gold or...

37:10.260 --> 37:15.960
I don't care what world it is. It's an alloy. People make white gold. It doesn't occur.

37:16.840 --> 37:23.580
And that makes it possible for me to hypothesize a world in which that particular technology does not exist.

37:26.280 --> 37:31.400
There's no gold at all in the first trilogy, but you do find in the second, if you travel around the world,

37:31.500 --> 37:37.060
that there are other cultures with different attitudes who have discovered gold, yellow gold.

37:37.910 --> 37:47.080
The Kemper in Brotharilmo uses gold as a magical thing.

37:47.880 --> 37:59.560
So the metals do physically exist on the planet, but it is a particular kind of alloy and that makes it...

37:59.560 --> 38:05.080
I can then plausibly claim that this alloy does not exist in that world.

38:05.740 --> 38:12.400
Now, that's from a pragmatic point of view. From a thematic point of view, it's really important that we're talking about something here

38:12.400 --> 38:22.140
that is a combination of materials. The wedding ring that Covenant carries is, like himself, a paradox of a certain sense,

38:22.180 --> 38:26.320
or symbolically a paradox. It is made out of disparate materials.

38:26.600 --> 38:31.320
It is one kind of metal and another kind of metal fused together,

38:31.320 --> 38:39.440
and that is what Covenant does essentially in the course of the story, is that he learns to fuse the disparate sides of his dilemma,

38:39.600 --> 38:44.000
what they call the impossibility of believing the land true and the impossibility of believing it false,

38:44.020 --> 38:47.620
and he finds a way to make those into one thing.

38:49.040 --> 38:59.700
And it is out of those kinds of paradoxes that his strength comes, and so, of course, a ring that is an alloy is symbolically apt for those sorts of issues.

39:01.520 --> 39:06.800
Okay, I think I've read this correctly, but I would like to ask you about it.

39:06.800 --> 39:11.300
Of course, the staff of law is one of the more important... what device is motifs?

39:11.660 --> 39:14.000
You have it destroyed in the first trilogy.

39:14.620 --> 39:17.780
At the end of the second trilogy, it's reforged in a sense.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.940
You have the appointed, is that the Elohim?

39:21.220 --> 39:21.580
Yeah.

39:22.260 --> 39:30.520
And Vane, okay. Did I read this correctly in that the appointer, the Elohim, they're sort of the matter of the earth, the essence of it.

39:30.520 --> 39:31.780
Vane is the structure.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.020
Well, energy and structure.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.140
Energy and structure.

39:35.480 --> 39:39.020
Yeah, that's the simple way to put it.

39:44.140 --> 39:50.660
Any principle of power, I think, has to have energy and structure.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.480
William Blake used to talk about this.

39:53.220 --> 39:55.340
Reason is the circumference of energy.

39:55.340 --> 40:05.780
And if you don't have both reason and energy, you don't have anything at all, because if reason doesn't restrict energy, then it just floats away and you don't have any energy.

40:06.940 --> 40:15.440
And if energy doesn't press against reason, then, you know, it's like a balloon. There's nothing happening. Reason is lying there dead.

40:16.820 --> 40:20.700
And I think it seems natural to me that it would be that way in any situation.

40:20.900 --> 40:31.700
You need structure or rules, balance, order, and you need energy which is contained within that in order for there to be any effectiveness.

40:32.320 --> 40:39.320
And this is, of course, is perfectly consistent with the whole concept of law that's posited throughout the first and second trilogies.

40:39.320 --> 40:49.640
In this particular case, there is one other element that goes into remaking a staff of law, and that is the element of intention which Lyndon Avery provides.

40:49.880 --> 41:03.640
She provides the sense of purpose for the melding, but without, you know, the perfect structure which the Urviles created when they made vain.

41:04.140 --> 41:14.820
And without this, you know, this totally unstructured kind of energy which the Elohim represent, you know, it wouldn't be possible to remake the staff of law.

41:15.260 --> 41:18.820
And after all, this is not just an ordinary tool of magic we're talking about here.

41:19.260 --> 41:29.800
It's explained over and over again throughout the series that the staff of law by its very nature supports and defends the natural order.

41:29.800 --> 41:37.940
And it's very hard to use the power that the staff represents to do anything which violates the natural order or natural law.

41:38.320 --> 41:42.980
And when the staff is broken, that inherently weakens the entire natural order.

41:43.800 --> 41:47.060
It's more than just a magical tool here.

41:47.200 --> 41:51.780
It's an expression of a certain aspect of the existence of this world.

41:51.780 --> 42:02.200
And to make something like that again, you know, requires an extraordinary combination of potentialities and purposes.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.320
Is that second staff going to be stronger than the first?

42:05.980 --> 42:07.920
Well, I think it's going to be different in some ways.

42:08.120 --> 42:11.780
I wouldn't want to say stronger or something.

42:11.780 --> 42:21.960
But in the back of my mind, for example, I think of it as a living staff rather than as a piece of wood which is being used.

42:22.620 --> 42:26.360
Because after all, vein and fendale both went in to make that.

42:26.820 --> 42:30.960
And it would not... I mean, I don't know everything that's going to happen in the future.

42:31.120 --> 42:36.160
I haven't tried to figure it out, but it would not surprise me to find that this staff had a mind of its own.

42:36.160 --> 42:46.780
If it comes back in future stories and that there are various ways in which dealing with it is very different than with the old staff.

42:47.680 --> 42:54.320
Okay, I know when you go to conventions and you talk to fans and they ask about your books and so forth.

42:54.460 --> 42:59.640
I'm sure they ask you about your style and your use of your vocabulary, your large vocabulary and so forth.

43:02.080 --> 43:07.140
I heard you say this yesterday, but I have sensed this myself even before I heard you say it.

43:08.100 --> 43:10.320
You must have fun with your choice of words.

43:11.380 --> 43:13.940
Yeah, fun not in any...

43:15.000 --> 43:18.300
I'm sure there are people who think that I have fun in the sense of,

43:18.500 --> 43:20.680
boy, I'm going to fool people with this word.

43:21.420 --> 43:24.620
Ha ha ha, those stupid readers. They'll never know what I'm talking about now.

43:27.000 --> 43:34.620
That's not it at all. I really am not trying to confuse the issue by the vocabulary that I use.

43:34.720 --> 43:44.600
It is intended to communicate and generally I find that the readers who do the work to figure out what these words mean,

43:44.640 --> 43:48.380
find that it does communicate, that it says what I mean.

43:48.380 --> 43:55.660
And there are plenty of circumstances where I can justify that even though the word is unfamiliar or maybe even unknown to people,

43:55.780 --> 43:59.120
it's actually more precise than the other choices that I have.

43:59.720 --> 44:09.420
But the thing that gets me involved in that in the first place is that just words themselves seem to me to be a happy thing.

44:09.920 --> 44:15.700
I love words. I get a great sense of pleasure out of discovering a word that I didn't know before

44:15.700 --> 44:19.180
and finding out what it means and finding out how it can be used.

44:19.780 --> 44:21.060
You know, that cheers me up.

44:23.000 --> 44:32.600
And there are lots of ways in which I think that if my readers could just hear those words in the spirit in which I put them in the prose,

44:33.100 --> 44:39.640
they would find, for example, that the Covenant books aren't as grim in mood as they think they are

44:39.640 --> 44:47.620
because I'm shooting out these little gleams of pleasure all the time.

44:48.720 --> 44:53.640
And I wish those could be received in the way they were meant because then people would...

44:54.700 --> 44:59.420
Well, like real Musgrave, you were at the panel yesterday, real is an interesting man.

44:59.720 --> 45:08.700
And there are times when he just laughs and chuckles and grins reading things in my books which are grim and he knows that they're grim.

45:08.700 --> 45:14.540
It's not like he's stupid or insensitive, but he's also picking up some of the other things that I'm trying to project as well.

45:14.620 --> 45:19.020
There is an element of joy in those books which balances a lot of the dismay.

45:20.140 --> 45:25.860
And from my point of view, unfortunately, it's conveyed in...it's like being conveyed in code.

45:26.980 --> 45:33.700
It's conveyed through my love of language and not everybody on the other end receives that message that I'm trying to put out.
