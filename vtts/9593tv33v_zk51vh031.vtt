WEBVTT

00:07.658 --> 00:17.992
[SPEAKER_00]: In honor of the veterans who have served our country, both past and present, First National Bank, a Franklin family community bank, proudly sponsors Veterans of the Valley.

00:18.493 --> 00:28.367
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1862, First National has provided local decision making and accessibility, as well as banking products and services to Brazos Valley citizens.

00:37.645 --> 00:50.490
you

00:57.811 --> 01:00.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us on another edition of Veterans of the Valley.

01:01.296 --> 01:04.561
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to be doing something a bit different from our standard program.

01:05.042 --> 01:07.565
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be talking about Project HOLD.

01:07.585 --> 01:13.193
[SPEAKER_01]: Project HOLD is the City of College Station's historic online library database.

01:13.714 --> 01:23.869
[SPEAKER_01]: They are archiving the history of College Station and the surrounding areas for everyone to access and enjoy at hold.cstx.gov.

01:23.849 --> 01:28.240
[SPEAKER_01]: With us today is Ann Boykin, Project Coordinator for Project Hold.

01:28.260 --> 01:29.262
[SPEAKER_01]: Ann, thank you for being with us.

01:29.302 --> 01:31.808
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kyle, and thanks to Tom for letting us come in here.

01:32.590 --> 01:34.956
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a little bit of background on Project Hold.

01:35.037 --> 01:44.026
[SPEAKER_01]: It started just a few years ago when we had done a series of oral histories and people decided that what are we going to do with it now?

01:44.066 --> 01:45.428
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we put it?

01:45.448 --> 01:49.692
[SPEAKER_01]: And the city did not have the facilities or the funding to have a museum.

01:49.792 --> 01:56.839
[SPEAKER_01]: So we already were using software to archive our just standard documents within the city.

01:56.859 --> 01:59.442
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using that to put our documents online.

01:59.422 --> 02:04.188
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just decided to make it digital and give it access to everyone, which is a great idea.

02:04.208 --> 02:11.657
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though we're more or less focusing on veterans and military type applications, Project Hold is far more reaching than that.

02:11.677 --> 02:14.621
[SPEAKER_01]: It covers the broad spectrum of everything that's going on in our area.

02:14.661 --> 02:15.062
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.

02:15.202 --> 02:20.008
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a laundry ticket from 1934 or 1968, it might be interesting to us.

02:21.029 --> 02:24.754
[SPEAKER_01]: We're open to anything and everything that documents our daily life, especially.

02:24.835 --> 02:25.576
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

02:25.757 --> 02:30.465
[SPEAKER_01]: You were kind enough to give us a pretty good broad spectrum of pictures that we're going to look at here.

02:30.485 --> 02:36.335
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these pictures, some of our viewers have already seen because those veterans have been on the show, but they're such good pictures.

02:36.736 --> 02:43.588
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to kind of reshow them again and let them see exactly what they're missing and what they can find out by just going to your website.

02:43.668 --> 02:44.069
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

02:44.089 --> 02:45.752
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and get to the pictures if we could.

02:45.872 --> 02:46.253
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

02:47.195 --> 02:48.318
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us what this picture is about.

02:48.338 --> 02:51.026
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously a lot of people should maybe be able to recognize this area.

02:51.047 --> 02:52.591
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a parade, downtown Bryan.

02:52.611 --> 02:54.938
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you recognize a few of the buildings there on Main Street.

02:55.179 --> 03:01.879
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were doing parades and kind of promotions to hopefully get more volunteers to go across World War I.

03:02.028 --> 03:06.193
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we talked about this earlier from the perspective of where this picture was taken.

03:06.233 --> 03:09.516
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this person would write about where the Palace Theater is now.

03:09.536 --> 03:10.197
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

03:10.217 --> 03:12.880
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back towards that intersection right there.

03:12.900 --> 03:13.060
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

03:13.461 --> 03:17.305
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is probably Main Street and I can't remember what that cross street is.

03:17.325 --> 03:17.846
[SPEAKER_01]: 26th?

03:18.607 --> 03:20.268
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it might be 26th Street.

03:20.649 --> 03:21.410
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's around 1914.

03:21.430 --> 03:21.950
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

03:22.351 --> 03:24.773
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another one of the gatherings.

03:24.794 --> 03:28.778
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a tank from World War I. Everybody's standing appropriately far back from it.

03:29.218 --> 03:30.600
[SPEAKER_01]: And the peak...

03:30.783 --> 03:32.748
[SPEAKER_01]: Peaked building in the right of your screen.

03:32.768 --> 03:33.449
[SPEAKER_01]: Down the lower right.

03:33.570 --> 03:36.176
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, lower right is the Aston building.

03:36.577 --> 03:40.286
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that should give everyone a perspective of where they were at there in downtown Bryan.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.331
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look like a paved street to me.

03:42.351 --> 03:44.977
[SPEAKER_01]: It still looks like it's pretty much compressed dirt right now.

03:46.421 --> 03:47.323
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's move on.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.036
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us who this is.

03:50.136 --> 03:52.059
[SPEAKER_01]: This young man we don't have a name for.

03:52.079 --> 03:53.421
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to have a name for him.

03:53.461 --> 04:04.437
[SPEAKER_01]: If you recognize the photograph, it was just one that was in a group of photographs that we scanned in, and we don't turn anything away, but I thought it was interesting, just his uniform and that they were living in tents.

04:04.497 --> 04:06.079
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this is maybe North Africa.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.105
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, it also gives a shot for the young people who watch the show.

04:10.246 --> 04:12.148
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how pictures kind of looked back in the days.

04:12.188 --> 04:15.353
[SPEAKER_01]: They would put the little borders on them and dress them up a little bit.

04:16.126 --> 04:21.820
[SPEAKER_01]: But like Anne said, if anyone knows where this picture came from or who this gentleman is, feel free to contact Anne.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.504
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they'd like to put a name to a face.

04:26.090 --> 04:29.578
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an honorable discharge for Luke Patronella from

04:29.845 --> 04:34.390
[SPEAKER_01]: the army after World War I, and I believe it's 1918.

04:34.430 --> 04:35.071
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

04:36.973 --> 04:41.658
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we go to the next document or the next picture, there's a little bit of a story between these two pictures.

04:41.918 --> 04:52.789
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he served in World War I, and here he's listed on this listing of gentlemen who served in World War II who did not make it back, and Luke Petronella died during World War II.

04:52.910 --> 04:54.872
[SPEAKER_01]: So he made it through WWI.

04:55.052 --> 04:57.034
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and there are a number of

04:57.284 --> 04:59.809
[SPEAKER_01]: names that are familiar around this area.

04:59.829 --> 05:05.820
[SPEAKER_01]: Carraba was one, and I'm going to forget some of them already.

05:05.840 --> 05:14.997
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was in a book that was given to us, and it documents veterans from Brazos County, Aggie veterans, and African American veterans, which is a rare thing for us to have.

05:15.198 --> 05:15.899
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

05:15.919 --> 05:16.440
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

05:16.420 --> 05:17.563
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of?

05:17.843 --> 05:23.136
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and this one is Mr. Thomas.

05:24.780 --> 05:28.168
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from Bryan, also served in World War II.

05:28.283 --> 05:30.065
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know if his family is still here in the area?

05:30.185 --> 05:31.267
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they are.

05:31.767 --> 05:33.289
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, that was Thomas Calhoun.

05:33.329 --> 05:35.312
[SPEAKER_01]: This young man is Fred Burrell.

05:35.853 --> 05:38.816
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's also from Bryan and served in World War II.

05:40.178 --> 05:42.241
[SPEAKER_01]: This gentleman was fairly well decorated.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.744
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would love to have some more history from the African-American.

05:44.764 --> 05:45.745
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I'd love to have more information.

05:45.865 --> 05:48.809
[SPEAKER_01]: This came from that yearbook that I was talking about.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.010
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.

05:52.373 --> 05:55.978
[SPEAKER_01]: This gentleman is Alphonse Hartle, sitting there in the Jeep with the

05:56.313 --> 06:01.722
[SPEAKER_01]: Cameron, earlier had taken some pictures of these German children, and it was interesting.

06:01.823 --> 06:06.350
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the soldiers, once they got to Germany, were able to buy cameras and start taking photographs.

06:06.391 --> 06:09.556
[SPEAKER_01]: His son lives here, and they gave us this photograph.

06:09.576 --> 06:12.621
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great picture of the German children sitting in the back of the American Jeep.

06:12.942 --> 06:13.162
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

06:16.127 --> 06:19.634
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Joe Bruce's group.

06:19.814 --> 06:20.515
[SPEAKER_01]: They were...

06:21.558 --> 06:29.249
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe when they were in Germany or flying over Germany, they were hit and they had to jump out.

06:29.549 --> 06:34.476
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a one and only jump, he said, and ended up in a German POW camp.

06:34.536 --> 06:37.821
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's the one kneeling in front, I believe, second from the right?

06:37.981 --> 06:38.382
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

06:38.402 --> 06:39.022
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that?

06:39.043 --> 06:44.971
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a navigator, I believe, on this plane and he's living here today.

06:46.193 --> 06:46.553
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

06:48.136 --> 06:49.098
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my dad.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.199
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on the show.

06:50.219 --> 06:52.163
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a striking gentleman, isn't he?

06:52.183 --> 06:53.104
[SPEAKER_01]: I put this in for fun.

06:53.445 --> 06:58.393
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally they got leave and they got to do something fun and he went on leave to Scotland.

06:58.413 --> 07:00.456
[SPEAKER_01]: Not your standard army apparel.

07:00.596 --> 07:01.478
[SPEAKER_00]: Not exactly.

07:01.658 --> 07:02.480
[SPEAKER_01]: Not exactly.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.443
[SPEAKER_01]: But we thought he looked cute.

07:04.743 --> 07:08.329
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I see this picture, I'm reminded of the old great movie Brigadoon.

07:08.409 --> 07:08.650
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

07:09.611 --> 07:12.536
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to go rent that tonight just because I see somebody in a kilt.

07:12.556 --> 07:14.920
[SPEAKER_01]: Or for all you Braveheart fans.

07:14.900 --> 07:19.644
[SPEAKER_01]: Cal Boykin, he was the A14th Tank Destroyer Battalion in the 7th Armored Division.

07:20.548 --> 07:22.277
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great, great picture.

07:23.827 --> 07:25.168
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a sad little picture.

07:25.188 --> 07:27.471
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a German child with a surrender flag.

07:27.491 --> 07:33.137
[SPEAKER_01]: This was given to us by Bill Adams, and I believe he was the gentleman who took the photograph.

07:33.598 --> 07:35.720
[SPEAKER_01]: That picture just speaks volumes.

07:35.900 --> 07:36.320
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.

07:36.341 --> 07:39.664
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does with just the little girl there and the white flag and the look on her face.

07:40.545 --> 07:48.313
[SPEAKER_01]: If the people at home can see the look on this little girl's face, it really... Anticipation and fear and happiness and everything all rolled into one.

07:48.333 --> 07:53.119
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in her face that there's a thousand different emotions going through her little mind right now.

07:53.319 --> 07:53.479
Exactly.

07:53.459 --> 07:54.741
[SPEAKER_01]: or when that picture was taken.

07:54.941 --> 07:55.742
[SPEAKER_01]: And explain this to us.

07:55.762 --> 08:00.048
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of our more interesting pieces of memorabilia that we photographed in the office.

08:00.068 --> 08:04.174
[SPEAKER_01]: Marguerite Anthony, who lives here, brought this to us.

08:04.374 --> 08:13.166
[SPEAKER_01]: Her father was in the CIC, the Counterintelligence Corps, that was in Germany right at the beginning of the occupation.

08:13.186 --> 08:19.635
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a piece of the toilet from Hitler's private bath at Eagles Nest.

08:19.615 --> 08:26.544
[SPEAKER_01]: And just one of your more unusual pieces of memorabilia that you don't see very often and we thought it'd be interesting to show.

08:26.725 --> 08:30.129
[SPEAKER_01]: And just that piece of memorabilia is actually here in the Brazos Valley.

08:30.350 --> 08:34.055
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

08:34.155 --> 08:40.463
[SPEAKER_01]: Her father, Bernie McClurkin, took quite a few photographs when they first entered Dachau.

08:40.964 --> 08:42.326
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the ovens.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.509
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

08:45.788 --> 08:46.609
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, next.

08:47.250 --> 08:47.971
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great picture.

08:48.231 --> 08:49.492
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Kyle's favorite.

08:49.673 --> 08:50.113
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.056
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Normandy invasion map.

08:52.096 --> 08:56.221
[SPEAKER_01]: This was loaned to us from Dr. Betloff.

08:57.082 --> 09:01.507
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in his book recently.

09:01.527 --> 09:04.911
[SPEAKER_01]: And that basically shows all the movements, true movements and the landing points.

09:04.931 --> 09:05.212
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

09:06.193 --> 09:10.598
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another one of Bernie McClurkin's photographs entering Dachau.

09:12.991 --> 09:18.645
[SPEAKER_01]: That had to be a strange feeling for those Army guys to go into that place for the first time, not knowing what was there.

09:18.966 --> 09:20.068
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.

09:20.088 --> 09:26.123
[SPEAKER_01]: And McClurkin was instrumental in gathering information that brought a lot of the Nazi war criminals to trial.

09:26.170 --> 09:28.753
[SPEAKER_01]: The SS and the Gestapo.

09:29.715 --> 09:36.343
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another great picture just because of the depth of field in it, just to let people know the perspective of where they were at.

09:36.363 --> 09:38.245
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're looking way down into a valley.

09:38.285 --> 09:39.888
[SPEAKER_01]: Way down into Oberammergau.

09:39.908 --> 09:43.032
[SPEAKER_01]: And these gentlemen, Bernie McClurkin is also in this photograph.

09:43.372 --> 09:46.376
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on their way walking up to Eagle's Nest.

09:46.396 --> 09:48.799
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of the three gentlemen, he's the one on the far left.

09:48.939 --> 09:49.059
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

09:49.079 --> 09:49.680
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

09:53.153 --> 10:06.326
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Lieutenant Colonel Rudder, who is, I believe this was taken just immediately after the Normandy invasion and surrounded by his troops and looks like they're kind of relaxing somewhat.

10:06.926 --> 10:10.590
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think possibly this was once they had ascended to the top of those cliffs?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.633
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, they're kind of gathering and collecting themselves, I would imagine.

10:13.653 --> 10:17.236
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, I guess back then he was Colonel Rudder and that's... Lieutenant Colonel, yes.

10:17.256 --> 10:19.739
[SPEAKER_01]: Lieutenant Colonel, where he circled his head there.

10:20.039 --> 10:21.220
[SPEAKER_01]: Rudder's Rangers.

10:23.225 --> 10:25.930
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another photograph with Bernie McClurkin.

10:26.010 --> 10:35.907
[SPEAKER_01]: They are walking up to the top of Eagle's Nest and they're being escorted by the gentleman in the center, an African-American who was Hitler's elevator operator.

10:36.128 --> 10:36.348
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

10:36.789 --> 10:37.871
[SPEAKER_01]: Very unusual photograph.

10:38.091 --> 10:40.075
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know any of the names of these individuals.

10:42.219 --> 10:42.319
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

10:42.339 --> 10:42.499
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

10:43.525 --> 10:45.768
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kozlovskys are an interesting couple.

10:45.788 --> 10:48.751
[SPEAKER_01]: They both served in the military and met towards the end of the war, I believe.

10:48.772 --> 10:49.693
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been on the show before.

10:49.713 --> 10:50.794
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been on the show.

10:50.814 --> 10:52.476
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was a nurse.

10:52.556 --> 10:53.537
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a pilot.

10:53.557 --> 10:55.420
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's in this, it's almost like a mash.

10:55.440 --> 11:03.370
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they had mash in World War II, but she's the nurse in the background of this surgical operation.

11:03.390 --> 11:03.610
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

11:04.451 --> 11:09.297
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's in the foreground here with her back to us, offloading a patient from one of the planes.

11:12.702 --> 11:15.471
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's here in this group of Russian soldiers.

11:15.491 --> 11:18.601
[SPEAKER_01]: This is taken close to the Alp River.

11:18.621 --> 11:21.008
[SPEAKER_01]: That's her in between the two Russians.

11:21.028 --> 11:21.349
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

11:22.774 --> 11:24.259
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting photograph.

11:24.279 --> 11:25.041
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great picture.

11:27.637 --> 11:31.063
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is her now husband Kozlowski shaving.

11:31.324 --> 11:35.371
[SPEAKER_01]: I always think daily pictures, you know, how do they manage, you know, what do they do?

11:35.432 --> 11:37.556
[SPEAKER_01]: Just shaving and getting dressed for the day.

11:37.836 --> 11:42.104
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know if, had they already met, like when this picture was taken, had he already met her?

11:42.244 --> 11:44.649
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they met briefly at a dance early on.

11:44.689 --> 11:47.935
[SPEAKER_01]: They never saw each other until at the end of the war where they got back together.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.037
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's the story.

11:49.169 --> 11:52.933
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but that's him basically getting his morning shave the best he can.

11:53.053 --> 11:57.017
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and here he is in the cockpit of C, I'm going to forget it, 21?

11:57.037 --> 11:58.318
[SPEAKER_01]: C-47.

11:59.440 --> 11:59.680
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.060
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

12:01.341 --> 12:03.444
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving the Aggie thumbs up there.

12:03.464 --> 12:04.685
[SPEAKER_01]: These are two local girls, Ms.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.506
[SPEAKER_01]: Landis and Ms.

12:06.026 --> 12:06.847
[SPEAKER_01]: Dowell.

12:06.867 --> 12:11.612
[SPEAKER_01]: They are mailing V-mail to Carol Landis' dad.

12:12.153 --> 12:14.535
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in front of the post office there at Northgate.

12:15.325 --> 12:16.868
[SPEAKER_01]: And the post office is still there.

12:16.888 --> 12:19.673
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look real close, you can see the windows and make out the building.

12:19.794 --> 12:21.597
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the post office that's over at Northgate.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.403
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bit of the home front.

12:24.423 --> 12:25.805
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is Carl Landis.

12:25.825 --> 12:28.951
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in front of his house on Dexter.

12:29.252 --> 12:32.558
[SPEAKER_01]: And he and his wife have both passed away in the last couple of years.

12:32.759 --> 12:33.580
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that house on Dexter?

12:33.601 --> 12:34.142
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it still there?

12:34.162 --> 12:34.883
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, still there.

12:35.284 --> 12:37.468
[SPEAKER_01]: She was my third grade teacher.

12:39.743 --> 12:41.266
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a Christmas card from the Pentagon.

12:41.286 --> 12:44.812
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this is around maybe 43 or so.

12:44.892 --> 12:52.285
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just an interesting wartime Christmas card with kind of a contradiction in terms there.

12:53.347 --> 12:56.132
[SPEAKER_01]: Merry Christmas from the Pentagon.

12:56.855 --> 12:57.316
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

12:57.876 --> 12:58.777
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a V-mail.

12:58.818 --> 13:00.480
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people haven't seen a V-mail before.

13:00.520 --> 13:13.036
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, letters were handwritten on special paper and then they photographed it, reduced it, folded it up and carried it over, you know, on planes so that it didn't take up so much space and it didn't weigh so much.

13:13.957 --> 13:14.077
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

13:14.558 --> 13:16.641
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's kind of an interesting concept.

13:16.661 --> 13:20.626
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably the first digital, they were thinking of emails.

13:21.026 --> 13:21.567
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

13:21.587 --> 13:22.869
[SPEAKER_01]: When they did this pretty much.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.010
[SPEAKER_01]: The precursor of email.

13:24.935 --> 13:27.340
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that's what a standard V-mail looked like back then.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.845
[SPEAKER_01]: V was for victory.

13:29.925 --> 13:30.306
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

13:31.067 --> 13:31.669
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's this gentleman?

13:31.709 --> 13:45.897
[SPEAKER_01]: Emilio Salazar, and he was working here on campus in the MSC and also at Cebisa, and he left to join the service, came back and went back to work at the MSC in Cebisa.

13:45.877 --> 13:46.999
[SPEAKER_01]: So did his duty and came back.

13:47.019 --> 13:48.942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe you said this was at Camp Bullis.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.204
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in San Antonio.

13:50.465 --> 13:55.093
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was given to us by his daughter.

13:56.976 --> 14:01.203
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave us quite a few pieces of memorabilia from their family, Dorothy Hernandez.

14:02.105 --> 14:03.888
[SPEAKER_01]: And is the rest of the family still here?

14:04.048 --> 14:04.349
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

14:05.310 --> 14:05.691
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

14:07.612 --> 14:12.483
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the ration books where you had to use ration stamps and some money to buy for things.

14:12.503 --> 14:21.081
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have the impression that a stamp, and you turn in a stamp and you got the item, but you also had to pay a little bit of money for it, you know, sugar, coffee,

14:21.415 --> 14:23.078
[SPEAKER_01]: Butter, gasoline.

14:23.098 --> 14:26.966
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the younger generations have never seen this type of thing.

14:26.986 --> 14:27.848
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.972
[SPEAKER_01]: All they're used to is their Master Carter visa.

14:30.052 --> 14:30.754
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

14:32.096 --> 14:34.100
[SPEAKER_01]: Or their Aggie Bucks, if it were.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.567
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our local veterans group in World War II.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.032
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have identification for the

14:40.012 --> 14:41.856
[SPEAKER_01]: gentlemen, but.

14:43.359 --> 14:45.283
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is another good reason if someone out there.

14:45.383 --> 14:48.509
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you recognize someone or anyone in the photograph.

14:48.589 --> 14:48.970
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

14:48.990 --> 14:56.465
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was your neighbor, if it was your uncle, your brother, please give Ann a call and let them know that the third guy from the right was my Uncle Billy or whoever it may be.

14:56.485 --> 14:56.786
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

14:58.069 --> 14:59.792
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to put some names to faces.

15:00.380 --> 15:11.595
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Katherine Parker, she's from Bryan, and she was out at Avenger Field studying to be a wasp and training, and I don't know any more about her story.

15:11.615 --> 15:23.350
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to have more information about her story, but the son of the commander of Avenger Field gave us a yearbook with a lot of the wasp information.

15:23.617 --> 15:35.490
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking the other day about the mascot for the wasp was the Fifi Nella, which was a cartoon character wasp that was drawn by Disney for the wasp.

15:35.510 --> 15:39.375
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually created by Walt Disney himself for that purpose.

15:39.395 --> 15:43.599
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that was his way of making his contribution, more or less.

15:43.619 --> 15:47.584
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an Avenger flying over, and you're going to know this better than I am, Kyle.

15:48.044 --> 15:53.050
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over the Majuro Islands, the Kwajalein Atoll, which is out in the South Pacific.

15:53.637 --> 15:58.502
[SPEAKER_01]: which is where I was at for about two and a half, three years, working for Armed Forces Radio and Television.

15:59.503 --> 16:03.327
[SPEAKER_01]: Majorelle's great, thousands of islands out there, and that does bring back a lot of memories.

16:03.347 --> 16:10.575
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always amazed when I look at this at how small that plane is, and this is what the WASP were training to fly.

16:13.538 --> 16:21.366
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a group of Civil Air Patrol out at Coulter Field here, and the, I don't know if you can see it, the hangar in the background is still out there at,

16:21.633 --> 16:24.936
[SPEAKER_01]: Up there at the top right looks like maybe the top of a Quonset hut.

16:24.996 --> 16:26.918
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's what I used to call it.

16:27.239 --> 16:28.720
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have names for these?

16:28.740 --> 16:29.421
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.

16:29.441 --> 16:30.762
[SPEAKER_01]: No names for these either.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.223
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, ladies and gentlemen out there.

16:32.504 --> 16:33.585
[SPEAKER_01]: Your work is cut out for you.

16:34.265 --> 16:37.829
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lots of names to put to those faces.

16:37.849 --> 16:40.672
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first Aggie muster on Anzio.

16:40.712 --> 16:41.252
[SPEAKER_01]: On Anzio.

16:41.292 --> 16:41.553
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

16:42.434 --> 16:43.515
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was 1943.

16:44.075 --> 16:46.077
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

16:46.097 --> 16:48.940
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know where this picture originated from or who donated it?

16:49.021 --> 16:50.847
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I do not.

16:52.292 --> 16:55.303
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing, no way to put names to the faces or anything like that?

16:56.748 --> 16:59.638
[SPEAKER_01]: A&M may have something in their archives that would identify them.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.206
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great picture also, especially if we could find the names to those faces.

17:05.306 --> 17:06.869
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an interesting photo.

17:06.889 --> 17:08.031
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Floyd Gravett.

17:08.071 --> 17:17.585
[SPEAKER_01]: His sister, Joanna Yeager, lives here, and she gave us an opportunity to scan in her whole scrapbook on her three brothers who all served.

17:17.625 --> 17:23.755
[SPEAKER_01]: Two were killed in action, and this brother, Floyd, was a Japanese prisoner of war for a number of years.

17:23.855 --> 17:25.137
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even know if he was...

17:25.117 --> 17:27.021
[SPEAKER_01]: alive for about three years.

17:27.262 --> 17:32.473
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was commenting earlier that it looks like a pretty nice bunk there, a nice wooden floor.

17:32.493 --> 17:33.094
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks clean.

17:33.174 --> 17:34.497
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks pretty healthy.

17:34.517 --> 17:37.604
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was obviously at the beginning of his interment.

17:37.624 --> 17:38.606
[SPEAKER_01]: The very beginning of his interment.

17:38.646 --> 17:40.329
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was moved around.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.454
[SPEAKER_01]: So the conditions, I would imagine, got worse.

17:42.594 --> 17:45.741
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was, I have seen a photograph of him when he came home.

17:45.721 --> 17:49.247
[SPEAKER_01]: Very thin, very undernourished, but he survived.

17:49.267 --> 17:53.534
[SPEAKER_01]: But from looking at this pick, you would think, gee, prisoner of wars don't have it that bad, but they really did.

17:53.595 --> 17:53.935
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

17:54.336 --> 18:00.847
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the type of letters that his family would get occasionally that were written by the Imperial Japanese Army.

18:00.867 --> 18:02.730
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that at the top.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.535
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you would do if you were at home and you got a telegram from the

18:05.768 --> 18:07.472
[SPEAKER_01]: Imperial Japanese Army.

18:07.492 --> 18:07.812
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

18:08.053 --> 18:11.580
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they were writing, you knew, was contrived.

18:11.620 --> 18:16.350
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't necessarily a normal letter from your son at war.

18:16.370 --> 18:17.653
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just tell by the verbiage.

18:17.673 --> 18:18.555
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

18:18.575 --> 18:19.938
[SPEAKER_01]: Would not have been his language.

18:20.299 --> 18:20.419
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

18:22.525 --> 18:23.848
[SPEAKER_01]: Western Union telegram.

18:23.908 --> 18:36.156
[SPEAKER_01]: Telegrams went back and forth, and my uncle used to send telegrams all the time to my grandmother, and she would nearly have a heart attack because Western Union was, you know, if you got a Western Union, then something wrong had happened, something bad had happened.

18:36.176 --> 18:40.526
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the major, quickest way of communicating.

18:40.887 --> 18:41.007
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

18:46.994 --> 18:51.459
[SPEAKER_01]: This is James L. Boone, Jr., who's still living here in College Station.

18:51.499 --> 18:58.226
[SPEAKER_01]: He is, in this photograph there, on the road to Baggio in the Philippines, Luzon.

18:58.787 --> 18:59.728
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one is he in this picture?

18:59.748 --> 19:00.829
[SPEAKER_01]: He is in the middle.

19:00.849 --> 19:05.314
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one, I think, with his leg crossed there, leaning up against the jeep or whatever that is.

19:05.334 --> 19:11.841
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a very narrow road and a very, very steep cliff.

19:11.861 --> 19:12.141
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

19:14.129 --> 19:18.316
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've jumped, obviously, now we're in color, so this is more or less along the Vietnam era.

19:18.336 --> 19:18.576
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

19:18.596 --> 19:24.686
[SPEAKER_01]: This is at the end of the Vietnam War, and this is Bill Bratty and his group.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.871
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Bratty is the red-haired one on the kind of back left.

19:28.772 --> 19:30.475
[SPEAKER_01]: He was class of 71 here at A&M.

19:30.515 --> 19:32.238
[SPEAKER_01]: He also attended consolidated schools.

19:33.921 --> 19:37.386
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a Cobra trainer at that time.

19:40.015 --> 19:43.923
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is Bill again in Alaska years later.

19:44.023 --> 19:45.506
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say post-Vietnam.

19:46.027 --> 19:46.669
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, quite a bit.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.573
[SPEAKER_01]: Things had changed considerably.

19:49.174 --> 19:55.006
[SPEAKER_01]: His group helped form the unit that rescued the hostages in Tehran.

19:55.026 --> 19:56.168
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

19:57.093 --> 19:59.095
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, this is a totally different setting.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.437
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing some other flying.

20:00.978 --> 20:05.003
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Russ Harvell, who's the back row, second from the right.

20:05.203 --> 20:08.607
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one holding the grenade launcher for you other guys at home.

20:08.687 --> 20:10.389
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that recognize that.

20:10.409 --> 20:11.190
[SPEAKER_00]: That recognize that.

20:11.430 --> 20:13.693
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is in Vietnam.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.576
[SPEAKER_01]: He's with his patrol there.

20:17.658 --> 20:23.725
[SPEAKER_01]: Russ volunteered in, I believe, 67 to go to Vietnam.

20:23.705 --> 20:26.213
[SPEAKER_01]: And his whereabouts now, is he deceased?

20:26.233 --> 20:26.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he around?

20:26.896 --> 20:28.340
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he lives here in Bryan.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.163
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so he's here.

20:29.223 --> 20:30.467
[SPEAKER_01]: He's alive and kicking.

20:30.528 --> 20:32.153
[SPEAKER_01]: The Harvell family has quite a few.

20:32.173 --> 20:34.862
[SPEAKER_01]: There are members that live here in College Station in Bryan.

20:36.968 --> 20:38.471
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of my favorite pictures.

20:38.912 --> 20:44.301
[SPEAKER_01]: This is General Woody B. Kyle, the Kyle Field family.

20:46.044 --> 20:50.172
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was that lanky guy to his left?

20:50.232 --> 20:51.414
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what caught my eye.

20:51.815 --> 20:58.086
[SPEAKER_01]: Don Wayne was filming the Green Berets in Hue, Vietnam, and that's where Kyle was.

20:58.106 --> 21:01.072
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would have been early 60s, mid-early 60s, maybe, something like that?

21:01.092 --> 21:01.272
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

21:02.753 --> 21:09.939
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought it was interesting because John Wayne was the major military supporter.

21:09.979 --> 21:10.439
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he was.

21:10.460 --> 21:13.502
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have expected him to take this picture and be there right with the guys.

21:14.303 --> 21:15.003
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

21:15.063 --> 21:16.004
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another great picture.

21:17.385 --> 21:24.511
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the grandson of Will and the late Kitty Whirly, Andrew Garza.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.874
[SPEAKER_01]: He is in Baghdad in one of the palaces.

21:27.934 --> 21:32.338
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's one of Saddam's palaces, one of his many palaces that they took over.

21:32.318 --> 21:35.424
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this young man served 15 months.

21:35.524 --> 21:45.563
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in a computer group and he came home in December and just left recently to go back for another 15 months.

21:45.944 --> 21:47.066
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so he's back on tour again.

21:47.086 --> 21:48.268
[SPEAKER_01]: He's back on tour.

21:49.092 --> 21:51.195
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a small group.

21:51.255 --> 21:52.757
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a sniper group.

21:53.278 --> 21:56.342
[SPEAKER_01]: The young man on the second from the right.

21:56.543 --> 21:57.524
[SPEAKER_01]: With the stripes on his face.

21:57.544 --> 22:01.109
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Sergeant Mark Michelle is our adoptive platoon soldier.

22:01.450 --> 22:07.238
[SPEAKER_01]: His mother and I have been in school since first grade together, and his grandfather was our family doctor, Dr. O.C.

22:07.258 --> 22:07.598
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooper.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.002
[SPEAKER_01]: So we adopted this group.

22:10.042 --> 22:11.143
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's Tom's doctor.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.185
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, J.F.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.947
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooper is Tom, I think, yes.

22:13.967 --> 22:14.408
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

22:14.388 --> 22:16.551
[SPEAKER_01]: team of brothers.

22:17.231 --> 22:20.776
[SPEAKER_01]: Very prominent family here in College Station and Bryan.

22:21.637 --> 22:29.987
[SPEAKER_01]: But Sergeant Mark Michelle has been stationed in Iraq for 15 months and we adopted them about a year ago, October.

22:30.828 --> 22:40.519
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is going to be presented, has been presented with a presentation at City Council last week.

22:40.539 --> 22:44.344
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, he's a really neat young man.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.644
[SPEAKER_01]: and we expect to see a whole lot more of him.

22:47.664 --> 22:54.695
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be in the service, I think, another year and a half, and they're stationed in Alaska now.

22:54.715 --> 22:55.997
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is his group again.

22:56.057 --> 23:00.964
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in the front row left, the 509th Infantry.

23:00.984 --> 23:01.165
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

23:01.866 --> 23:02.727
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice group picture.

23:02.867 --> 23:03.328
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

23:04.726 --> 23:09.072
[SPEAKER_01]: And I take it, and obviously if you're a sniper, you'll know this, but obviously there's something about wearing the sunglasses.

23:09.512 --> 23:12.376
[SPEAKER_01]: It all has to do with the sunglasses.

23:12.396 --> 23:13.758
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is that behind those Ray-Bans?

23:13.778 --> 23:14.178
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

23:14.639 --> 23:15.700
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.002
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some really great pictures.

23:17.042 --> 23:17.943
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing those.

23:17.963 --> 23:18.564
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're welcome.

23:18.684 --> 23:20.066
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy sharing them with people.

23:20.427 --> 23:25.333
[SPEAKER_01]: So what other things, obviously we just focused on this, but like I said earlier, Project Hold,

23:25.313 --> 23:28.058
[SPEAKER_01]: covers a really, really broad gambit of everything.

23:28.098 --> 23:28.939
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.523
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything else we can talk about?

23:31.543 --> 23:38.415
[SPEAKER_01]: Last summer, we focused on the 60s, and we have an exhibit that's going to come down soon at the conference center.

23:39.617 --> 23:47.009
[SPEAKER_01]: But we scanned in a lot of photographs from that era, and it doesn't seem like that long ago, but it was 40 years ago.

23:47.029 --> 23:47.710
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.

23:47.690 --> 24:12.988
[SPEAKER_01]: it's scary but it was my class but um we have just a wide variety we have a lot of infrastructure uh city of college station construction photos when city hall was being built the groundbreaking for that and um anything and everything right arts and culture yeah uh what would someone need to do if they've found an old box up in the attic or something that their their granddad passed away and they're

24:12.968 --> 24:19.779
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're looking through all this stuff, and my gosh, it's a shame that they're just gonna hopefully not just get rid of it.

24:19.799 --> 24:27.652
[SPEAKER_01]: If they plan to get rid of it, no matter what they do, let me see it first, I wanna go through it first, and we can scan things in and give it back to them.

24:27.672 --> 24:29.635
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, now you don't keep the originals, just let everyone know that.

24:29.655 --> 24:31.298
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't keep the originals, they can have them back.

24:31.278 --> 24:42.051
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also encouraging people to, especially if they have military veterans, to participate in the Veterans History Project through the Library of Congress.

24:42.332 --> 24:42.872
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

24:42.892 --> 24:45.195
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will accept originals and things like that.

24:45.215 --> 24:46.437
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can talk to them about that.

24:46.537 --> 24:51.002
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have just ways of documenting their family's history.

24:51.043 --> 24:55.288
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every member of their family can be online and see the same things.

24:55.308 --> 24:56.169
[SPEAKER_01]: They can share it with them.

24:56.730 --> 24:57.350
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

24:57.491 --> 24:59.513
[SPEAKER_01]: Annie, what about contact information?

24:59.830 --> 25:06.258
[SPEAKER_01]: You can contact me at City Hall, 764-3491, and also on our website.

[SPEAKER_01]: All the stacks go to the side, and we just sit and visit.

25:20.215 --> 25:21.498
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only got a few minutes left.

25:21.538 --> 25:22.199
