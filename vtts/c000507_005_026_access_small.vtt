00:01.020 --> 00:03.420
What, did you sort of want to say something about theâ€”

00:03.420 --> 00:11.120
When we first spoke of Jack early on in there, and I said that Jack had invited me over,

00:12.260 --> 00:14.700
and this was in 1975.

00:15.880 --> 00:20.740
I thought there maybe it was 1976, and I came over and Jack signed some of the books for

00:20.740 --> 00:20.900
us.

00:20.960 --> 00:29.000
We did a limited edition, signed numbered edition, and Jack lives up in the hills there

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
in the Bay Area, and his house is up on the side of a hill, and a long narrow winding

00:39.000 --> 00:41.720
driveway goes up through the trees to his house.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.980
I went up and met him and got to know him after a little while, and been over there a

00:48.980 --> 00:56.500
number of times since then, just to, I guess just to visit more than anything else.

00:57.880 --> 01:05.360
I've gotten to know him and his charming wife Norma, who is kind of the one of the

01:05.920 --> 01:10.940
background or the basis of the whole thing that goes on over there.

01:11.060 --> 01:18.580
They're really a partnership, Jack and Norma, and their son John, who's 22 or 23 now, and

01:19.180 --> 01:25.780
the three of them are a family unit, and they work together, and they're very close, three

01:25.780 --> 01:26.120
of them.

01:28.720 --> 01:37.180
Jack's quite, for a fellow who's completely unknown within the field, in terms of a personality,

01:37.300 --> 01:48.520
no one knows him, he never goes anywhere, Jack's really a social guy, and has a number

01:48.520 --> 01:55.200
of parties, and goes out quite a bit, and socializes quite a bit, with really a wide

01:55.200 --> 01:56.020
variety of people.

01:58.220 --> 02:08.500
Jack and Norma and John and I, and got to be quite good friends.

02:10.560 --> 02:16.080
Our friendship was really not, it just started with the book, I guess, and with publishing

02:16.080 --> 02:22.260
Jack, but that's just sort of, it's almost an excuse for us to be together, and we spent

02:22.260 --> 02:26.660
a lot of time together, and I'm not even sure what we talk about.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.200
A lot of what we talk about is illustration.

02:29.600 --> 02:39.040
Jack's a great lover of classical illustration, which is to say, a Beardsley, and Kay Nielsen,

02:41.120 --> 02:46.980
and Harry Clark, and people who were illustrating at the turn of the century, in the early 20th

02:46.980 --> 02:53.340
century, and I guess we spent a lot of time talking about that, and a lot of time just

02:53.340 --> 03:01.840
talking about anything but Jack's work, which we almost never discuss, it never comes up.

03:04.580 --> 03:11.720
And last year in Baltimore, Chuck came out here to Pennsylvania, where I am now, here

03:11.720 --> 03:18.420
visiting Chuck, and Jack came out and stayed with Chuck for a while, and they got to be

03:18.420 --> 03:18.960
good friends.

03:19.460 --> 03:25.260
They'd known each other only at a distance, and they spent, actually the three of us spent

03:25.260 --> 03:31.560
some time together, four of us, I should say, Norma was there, and somehow without,

03:32.240 --> 03:37.500
somehow without Norma sort of the key to this whole thing in a way that I can't explain,

03:37.500 --> 03:49.400
but in any case, Chuck and Chuck's wife, and myself, and Mara, and Jack and Norma, just

03:49.400 --> 03:55.320
got together and spent a lot of time together, and it's an unusual thing when something like

03:55.320 --> 04:00.640
a book, or I guess a work of art in a sense, brings people together and performs the basis

04:00.640 --> 04:06.260
of what later becomes very close friendship, and particularly in Jack's case, because Jack

04:06.260 --> 04:12.480
never discusses his work, and it doesn't care to, somehow once he's finished a piece,

04:12.680 --> 04:18.620
it's as if he's lost the ship, and the ship goes, sails away, and he's no longer a part

04:18.620 --> 04:20.040
of it, and that's how he feels.

04:21.740 --> 04:26.160
Of course, anyone wants to, you know, enjoy his recognition, and Jack should get more

04:26.160 --> 04:33.380
than he does, but Jack's life is not really, has very little to do with literature, except

04:33.380 --> 04:38.920
that he writes it, he doesn't associate with people who have to do with literature, his

04:38.920 --> 04:44.240
friends are from all walks of life, many of the musicians, because Jack himself is a musician,

04:44.420 --> 04:50.700
and enjoys music to a great extent, and you see that in his work, you see it showing up

04:50.700 --> 04:57.220
in his books, and time and time, and that's most of what I wanted to say, I just wanted

04:57.220 --> 05:11.700
to get a little of the personal in there, Jack's been a good friend, and he's been an

05:11.700 --> 05:21.420
unusual fellow, and it's an unusual kind of communication, and you, if you enjoy Jack's

05:21.420 --> 05:26.480
works like I do, would probably have the same sort of relationship or communication, because

05:26.480 --> 05:34.980
it's with that understanding of life that is the reason that you and I both enjoy Jack's

05:34.980 --> 05:41.060
works, because he sees things a certain way, and reacts to things a certain way, and just

05:41.060 --> 05:49.080
sees a certain colors or whatever, and life around them, and it's interesting and a pleasure

05:49.080 --> 05:54.060
to communicate with a person like that, because you can speak of certain things that normally

05:54.060 --> 06:00.480
might never come up in your life, otherwise, it may never come up in your casual conversation

06:00.480 --> 06:09.640
with your friends, or your business associates, or whatever, and Jack and Norma, and I and

06:09.640 --> 06:15.800
Chuck all share that kind of communication, it's sort of a rare thing, and not really

06:15.800 --> 06:18.340
something that can be surrounded or defined by words.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.660
Okay, that's very good. Listen, as long as you brought it up, can I shoot a couple more

06:23.660 --> 06:24.380
quick ones at you?

06:24.460 --> 06:24.880
Why not?

06:26.860 --> 06:32.140
When we spoke to him, I asked him a question about essentially like what do you want to

06:32.140 --> 06:37.040
be remembered for, or what's your conception of your own work, and so forth, and he replied

06:37.040 --> 06:41.120
in this way, and I think he was joking, he said, I want to be remembered as a rich science

06:41.120 --> 06:41.680
fiction writer.

06:43.580 --> 06:46.220
How would you respond to his conception of his own work?

06:46.680 --> 06:55.240
Well, Jack, he's stepping into a role there to avoid a question which I guess any writer

06:55.240 --> 07:02.260
might want to avoid, I don't know. I know Jack is offended by artists who take themselves

07:02.260 --> 07:08.840
too seriously, and that, as you know, is a real problem with artists and writers today,

07:08.840 --> 07:14.840
is once they take themselves seriously, then they're finished really. Most of them are

07:15.560 --> 07:22.820
finished as originators or as true artists. And so Jack refuses to take himself seriously

07:22.820 --> 07:32.840
and does not act like an artist, or plonk like an artist, or whatever, and as far as

07:32.840 --> 07:37.780
being a rich science fiction writer, I don't know. If Jack had wanted to be rich, he could

07:37.780 --> 07:44.120
have, he did some work in Hollywood and he could have stayed down there, or he could

07:44.120 --> 07:49.420
have gone through the motions like a lot of other writers and appeared on the shows and

07:51.600 --> 07:55.640
publicized his own work and promoted his own work, and he didn't do that, and this was

07:55.640 --> 08:02.000
by personal inclination and by choice. So as far as what he wants to be remembered for,

08:02.940 --> 08:09.740
Jack always says that he wants his work to stand for by itself, and I think he just

08:09.740 --> 08:16.800
wants to be remembered for his work. He refuses to pick favorites among his work. I know he

08:16.800 --> 08:23.520
likes his Demon Prince series a lot for good reason. He likes The Palace of Love, which

08:23.520 --> 08:31.980
is the third in that series. He likes the Eyes of the Overworld, the sequence of the

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
stories of the fellow Cougal, and that's partly because Cougal's a rascal and Vance

08:40.160 --> 08:47.140
and Stoff is a bit of a rascal, and Cougal's even more so. He's the kind of a rascal that

08:47.140 --> 08:52.060
Vance would like to be if he wasn't such a nice guy at heart.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.900
Would he mind if we put a quote like that on our show from you?

08:55.900 --> 09:08.240
Oh, not at all, Jack. In fact, if I were to sit here and insult Jack and call the guy

09:08.240 --> 09:15.340
a lot of names, he would probably enjoy hearing it on the radio simply as a practical joke.

09:16.960 --> 09:25.880
Those kind of situations occur in Jack's book where one person who was helpless to defend

09:25.900 --> 09:37.920
himself or reply gets smeared in public or private. I won't do that to Jack, but Jack

09:37.920 --> 09:39.160
certainly would not mind it.

09:40.260 --> 09:45.980
Okay, listen also, when I spoke with him, near the end of the interview I was asking

09:45.980 --> 09:49.440
about his future work and so forth, and he mentioned that book he just finished and what

09:49.440 --> 09:58.020
he might have planned. Just in your personal opinion, are there as many or are there some

09:58.020 --> 10:02.880
more really good books that he is going to be writing? I kind of got the impression he

10:02.880 --> 10:07.660
wondered if he still had it, if he could still write up to the standards he had set for himself.

10:08.380 --> 10:13.400
Well, that's, you know, every writer feels that, particularly when they're not finished

10:13.400 --> 10:21.120
with the work and Jack is finishing up this work and he's this lioness, this large fantasy

10:21.120 --> 10:29.740
work which takes place on earth. Lioness is kind of like Averon, it's some kind of mythical

10:30.400 --> 10:36.420
island offshore or Britain somewhere if you wanted to locate it. It's sometime in the

10:36.420 --> 10:43.400
far past and it's a magical place with elves and trolls and beings like that.

10:44.460 --> 10:52.940
And yeah, I think this is a major work and I think there will be a few more. Jack's writing

10:52.940 --> 11:00.720
fewer books but he's going to write just a few large major pieces now. He's kind of

11:00.720 --> 11:05.420
done fooling around. One of the reasons he's writing, he was writing all these kind of

11:05.420 --> 11:11.140
unrelated books and these books, they weren't short but they certainly weren't long, was

11:11.140 --> 11:18.680
that no one would pay him to do any differently and he was making money as a writer and no

11:18.680 --> 11:27.520
one would, until Berkeley gave him a reasonable advance on the work that he's doing now which

11:28.080 --> 11:33.260
allowed him to work for a year or two on it, uninterrupted. I mean there's economic reasons

11:33.260 --> 11:40.360
for this sort of thing. So he finally had the stature and found a publisher that believed

11:40.360 --> 11:47.580
in him. Don Mulheim also has done a good deal for Jack, put a lot of his books out, got

11:47.580 --> 11:53.840
them all back into print but Berkeley will be publishing this particular book and he's

11:53.840 --> 11:58.540
been able to do it so he's doing that. And Jack when he wrote the last two of the Demon

11:58.540 --> 12:03.980
Prince books, they all were the same. He re-read the first three and he thought, you know,

12:04.020 --> 12:11.640
God these are really good books and they are in fact astounding works of literature and

12:11.640 --> 12:16.540
he wondered if he could, if he was up to snuff, if he could still write like that and then

12:16.540 --> 12:20.680
he sat down and wrote two more and they were very different than the first three but they

12:20.680 --> 12:28.960
were as good. And in fact some people liked them better. I guess it's a matter of preference

12:28.960 --> 12:38.240
but I think what you heard was a writer just thinking to himself. I've read a little bit

12:38.240 --> 12:43.280
of the work that he's, that it's the thing that he's working on now and there's some

12:43.280 --> 12:46.920
tremendous stuff in there. That's all I can say about it.

12:47.880 --> 12:51.880
Okay, I can think of one more. This is sort of a personal opinion question too just between

12:51.880 --> 12:56.980
two Jack Vance fans. I suppose any writer has to put some of himself into his characters.

12:57.360 --> 13:03.580
You mentioned that maybe there's a little of Vance in Cougal for instance. In my reading

13:03.580 --> 13:08.600
of his work I would say that maybe in the Durdain trilogy the protagonist, Gastel Lettswain,

13:09.700 --> 13:14.160
of all the characters Vance has written about, to me that would seem closest to what I would

13:14.160 --> 13:17.180
conceive of him as being. How would you respond to that?

13:18.640 --> 13:27.340
Yeah, you've got it there and also there's a lot of Vance in Inferio, in the man and

13:27.340 --> 13:34.300
his son, you know, because Jack and Norma are both very close to their son John and Inferio

13:34.300 --> 13:39.660
in a sense was kind of written I think for John to read at some later date in his life.

13:39.660 --> 13:49.540
John and his son John doesn't read any of his father's books and I think Jack wrote that

13:49.540 --> 13:56.560
book for John and I would say yes. I'd say Durdain and Jack likes that series a lot and

13:56.560 --> 14:02.980
they're really mature works. Yeah, there's a lot of them in there because Jack is a musician

14:02.980 --> 14:11.000
and just a musician going out into the world and finding things out about himself and the

14:11.000 --> 14:20.900
world around him. But Cougal also, you know, Jack's a bit of a rascal and that part of

14:20.900 --> 14:22.860
him happens to be Cougal.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.700
Are you going to do Durdain by the way?

14:26.020 --> 14:26.280
Yeah.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.520
I'm looking forward to that one, that's probably my favorite.

14:30.480 --> 14:36.180
Yeah. Yeah, that's, some people feel that way. People really like that series.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.600
No, you're right. When you said it was a mature work, I think that's very subtle.

14:40.080 --> 14:44.300
Yeah. Yeah. Listen, our connection is kind of getting bad now anyhow and I think that's

14:44.300 --> 14:46.240
probably all the time we bettered.

14:46.240 --> 14:46.820
Very good.

14:47.180 --> 14:52.380
Just a second. David has, oh, David wants to know if you're going to do the hardcover

14:52.380 --> 14:53.140
blindness ever.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.720
Yeah, as a matter of fact we're planning to do that because Berkley's probably going

14:57.720 --> 15:02.440
to issue it as a trade paperback. So if it works out, yes, we are going to do a hardcover

15:02.440 --> 15:03.200
edition of that.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.600
And so theoretically yours would be the first hardcover?

15:05.900 --> 15:09.160
Yeah, it'll be the first edition also if we can precede them.

15:09.440 --> 15:09.720
Yeah.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.100
And it'll be a small edition, probably 700 copies, whatever.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.020
Yeah, we're going to stay on your mailing list then.

15:16.460 --> 15:16.600
Good.

15:17.060 --> 15:19.860
Listen, we sure appreciate your time again and thank you very much.

15:19.940 --> 15:20.220
Okay.

15:20.860 --> 15:21.880
Yeah. Okay.

15:22.140 --> 15:25.780
If you have any other questions or whatever just call me at home or call Chuck here.

15:25.940 --> 15:26.920
We might do that. Thank you.

15:26.920 --> 15:27.580
Very good.

15:27.740 --> 15:28.380
Thank you. Bye.
