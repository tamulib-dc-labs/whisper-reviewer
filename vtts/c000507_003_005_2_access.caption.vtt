00:05.740 --> 00:16.500
Okay. The tapes are rolling and I believe I see the needle's moving. Okay.
Since the siege of wonder came out, we haven't seen anything, any novels or short stories either.

00:17.800 --> 00:28.840
We talked about this a while ago, but this is for the tape. Do you plan to do
any more writing? Have you outgrown that? Is that gone? Oh, no. Oh gosh, it's

00:28.840 --> 00:33.760
like being

00:33.760 --> 00:46.760
a Catholic. No one is never a Catholic again. You just don't happen to be doing
it at any one time. I certainly, desperately hope to keep writing and put

00:46.760 --> 00:59.720
something together which will be a good piece of work. Right now, as I said, at
the time, I hope I'm becoming also a better lawyer a more able attorney and that

00:59.720 --> 01:14.440
means I can do more and I am expected to do more and I want to. Also we now have
three children instead of two and that all presents a lot of breaks in the day

01:14.440 --> 01:25.720
and a reduction of available time. It's rather difficult to be turning over a
consistent plot line in your mind when somebody insists just because they're

01:25.720 --> 01:33.980
paying you much too much money an hour to think about their problems. It's kind
of difficult to maintain the threat of your character's problems in your mind so

01:33.980 --> 01:41.500
that when you're ready to sit down, you at least have, if you don't know what's
going to happen next, at least you remember what's just happened. By the same

01:41.500 --> 01:54.700
token, organization of children and things like that, charming little people
like that make it kind of difficult to write some bitter black stuff that I've

01:54.700 --> 01:55.360
done before.

01:59.260 --> 02:07.340
And so, you know, times change, people change, and environments change, and I
certainly have every intention of sticking at it until it comes together again.

02:07.500 --> 02:18.500
I can't really conceive of any time when I just pack up a typewriter forever and
say, that's it for me. There's no more point in all this. I've never allowed

02:18.500 --> 02:26.660
that. I think to come back to something I already mentioned, I've never allowed
the writing, although it has probably been the most important part of my life

02:26.660 --> 02:39.540
for a great many years in one sense or another. It has never dominated to the
extent that, well, to the extent that I really had to do a good job or to the

02:39.540 --> 02:51.480
extent that failure in any given time frame was to be personal disaster. I
remember the biographies of the great writers of the 30s and those kind of those

02:51.480 --> 03:06.040
stuff, They tend to be a great many writers who do it, what I'd say, do it for
real. And boy, even the great ones very often come to a pretty sad end. It's a

03:06.040 --> 03:10.020
hard regiment. I'm sure everybody realizes.

03:15.020 --> 03:19.060
it's a little daunting even now maybe even personally now

03:23.520 --> 03:35.700
You mentioned you're a lawyer and that oh okay, I go to science fiction
conventions and there are not a lot of lawyers there in fact, there are very few

03:35.700 --> 03:48.320
it just doesn't seem that people who are into that or into science fiction, how
did your bosses, your peers, the people that you work with at your law firm, how

03:48.320 --> 03:55.880
did they take your, when you published the Siege of Wonder and knowing what you
had done, how did they view that? I'm curious. They viewed it with a great deal

03:55.880 --> 04:10.060
of favor because I bought the drinks for that time. The law firm I'm with right
now has a very good mix of personalities and achievements of one field or

04:10.060 --> 04:22.100
another. And it happens to be mine, and it's regarded certainly without the
least bit of law, but I think what I have to be a little, you know, the firm

04:22.100 --> 04:33.820
itself attracts people with different abilities, perspectives, and
personalities. The idea of the New York law firm, or the organization lawyer, to

04:33.820 --> 04:45.780
a large law firm, we only have about 20 folks in ours and as an organization I
think it still cultivates individuality and that happens to be evidence of mine

04:45.780 --> 04:57.700
so it's it's gosh some of the guys in an interview even read the books and they
tell me they enjoy it like I said but then I was buying so it fits in very well

04:57.700 --> 05:10.740
it's not and again going back to what I just said it does not dominate my life
I've not allowed it to um nor have I sought a situation where it could if I

05:10.740 --> 05:20.820
wasn't paying attention or where I would feel that that would be the thing to
do. So I certainly would be very insulted if anybody called it a hobby or

05:20.820 --> 05:34.660
dabbling. I don't believe it's that. But when I'm in the law firm, I trust I'm
regarded as a lawyer who has written some books rather than a has-been-writer

05:34.660 --> 05:48.560
who does it for a living right now. Do you actively or just somewhat keep up
with fantasy and science fiction in its current state now? Regrettably not, no.

05:49.180 --> 05:53.120
I'm a very slow reader. I just don't have enough time.

05:57.300 --> 06:09.220
My primary reading category has always been history, and still is, but I'm just
trying to read as much as I possibly can of whatever appears to be interesting

06:09.220 --> 06:24.740
rather. So I try to mix it in with a pretty fair cross-section of the I don't
want to say popular science, but say comprehensible science, history, novels,

06:26.140 --> 06:34.900
magazines, and sort of things. I still read as much as I can, but it's not a
great deal. Not nearly as much as I'd like. And, of course, what's happening in

06:34.900 --> 06:50.440
science fiction, I've really been out of that for as much as I was ever that are
truly in it for quite some time. So, as far as the latest region in the plot or

06:50.440 --> 07:02.220
aspect, I really couldn't help you there. I did belong to the Fine Fiction
Writers Association for a while, went to a little minor convention here in

07:02.220 --> 07:03.780
Oregon.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.760
So, that was about it, really. organization.

07:14.200 --> 07:24.160
Have you ever considered, if you do write science fiction again, maybe combining
your legal mind with the future, anyway, maybe not science fiction but the

07:24.160 --> 07:34.360
future? There's not been much of that done. Well, I hate to say it but on the
latest attempt on the book that I'm trying to do now, I've really broken myself

07:34.360 --> 07:44.420
down. I'm trying to get away from what I've done. I realize there's very often
only a very few kinds of characters that I have in the prior four books and in

07:44.420 --> 07:54.120
the latest one I'm trying to make the guy a little more of a positive
personality and as it's turned out at least in the latest beginning the fellow

07:54.120 --> 08:05.300
of the Attorney General of the United States so I guess that means something I'm
a little embarrassed by it but it's something different at least he's the

08:05.300 --> 08:16.540
Attorney General of what's left us of the United States. Have you ever read any
books by Charles Harness? Yeah, I haven't. Okay. He's a patent lawyer and he's

08:16.540 --> 08:25.040
one of my very favorite. He's one of these, another one of these people that
produces a lot of books. He's produced six now and he's about 65. But he has one

08:25.040 --> 08:35.120
that just came out called The Venetian Court, which is from a short story. I
think it's about, I think it's in the near future whenever, if you violate a

08:35.120 --> 08:44.960
patent or if you go around something that's patented and you do it anyway, that
you get the death penalty and the lawyer argues the case. And he writes, he has

08:44.960 --> 08:52.780
some short stories that are pretty interesting about lawyers. And other than
that, I don't think there's any other, there are very few lawyer protagonists or

08:52.780 --> 09:01.040
lawyer situations in science fiction. I really, none spring to mind that, in my
experience, that the guy, by the way, in this latest story, even though he is a

09:01.040 --> 09:16.280
lawyer, the attorney general. It's not going to be a law story, he's going to
have that position as much for symbolistic purposes as anything else. But it's

09:16.280 --> 09:29.020
not going to be real what if you do a courtroom battle in the past or future, or
side time. That may be an area, the last thing I want to get into is coming home

09:29.020 --> 09:36.660
from the law and writing the law office. I'm also afraid I just might get into
second defending frustrations again, too. I'm not sure I can do that

09:36.660 --> 09:37.060
potentially.

09:40.060 --> 09:49.060
Okay, that's the end of my question list, so I'll turn the tapes off. Okay. I
wanted to ask you just a couple things off the cuff. When you were in law, you

09:49.060 --> 09:55.940
went to New York University. Where did you live? Did you live right by the
university, right on Washington Square? Maiden Hall right on Washington Square.

09:56.340 --> 10:06.720
Well, I had friends that lived in the village on 4th Street right there, just
that side of 6th Avenue, and we stayed there part of one summer and really had a

10:06.720 --> 10:24.140
great time. Well, it's a weird neighborhood. When were you there? This would
have been the summer of 76. Okay, well, I was there from 68 to 71. um yeah the

10:24.140 --> 10:32.580
problem of course being in school is you've got a lot to do you don't have much
money even if you did have the time and the law school itself is pretty much a

10:32.580 --> 10:49.320
closed little society a lot of folks commuted um um you're sure the tape isn't
on? yeah no problem a real dull bunch of people uh real uh uh I was very much

10:49.320 --> 11:00.240
interested in Wall Street or righteousness, hopefully combining the two. I don't
know how they're going to do that. I was at a very good scholarship group, so I

11:00.240 --> 11:09.100
was fortunate in that aspect. I had some people that I really got along with.
But, you know, it also had the classic New York syndrome, the world ends at the

11:09.100 --> 11:15.580
Hudson River. Maybe if you stand high enough, you can see the John Hancock
básica in Chicago and the Golden Gate Bridge, and of course everybody knows

11:15.580 --> 11:28.520
there's nothing in between. very provincial so that's there's a lot of good
stuff around there a lot of very exciting stuff but as far as my day-to-day

11:28.520 --> 11:47.560
environment pretty discouraging I have a friend who went she's my she got a
she's a Columbia religion undergraduate and then she messed around. Her husband

11:47.560 --> 11:55.980
went to grad school. He's a psych prof. And she's now in her third year at the
University of Texas Law School. And it's been real interesting to see how she

11:55.980 --> 12:06.020
has changed because of law school and she knows it. Just getting in that
mindset. I think her assessment of some of the people that was pretty dull, I

12:06.020 --> 12:12.940
think that's pretty true, by and large. Yeah, it is. And I'll tell you, the
change of thinking, you hear so much about this, about thinking like a lawyer.

12:12.940 --> 12:20.460
it's not that much of a change. It becomes a little bit of a change because it's
surrounded by the secret language. You know, you're picking up a couple of

12:20.460 --> 12:27.580
Captain Midnight words that nobody else, you know, the guy on the street doesn't
know. You're learning things which, when you think about it, aren't terribly

12:27.580 --> 12:39.300
complicated, but by the same time, they're a little artificial. So that, again,
it's unique. The average Joe doesn't know it, so you know something he doesn't.

12:39.940 --> 12:52.220
And as far as the techniques of thinking go, gee, the only real trick is just to
think very carefully, logically, and analytically. And if you do that, and start

12:52.220 --> 13:05.740
with first things first, I mean, that's the great secret as far as the business
of the Socratic method in class and thinking like a lawyer. I really think it's

13:05.740 --> 13:16.920
considerably overblown. But don't tell her I may be wrong or if I'm right
that'll make her sad. I was glad you mentioned to talking about Kenyon I had a

13:16.920 --> 13:26.840
friend that went to Kenyon his name was Aaron Burke I think he would have
graduated Yeah. Wait a minute. And he would have been a year older than me? Yeah

13:26.840 --> 13:40.820
at least. Uh huh. Aaron the Baron? I didn't know him as Aaron the Baron. Yeah
that's Aaron. Yeah, he's a masternatic. Oh, wow. He was a, let's see, when I was

13:40.820 --> 13:54.560
a senior in college, I was working in, I'm a chemist and I was working in a lab
for a professor, an Aaron post-doctoral Dr. This was at Rice. Yeah, right, he

13:54.560 --> 14:03.960
was a chemist. He was a brilliant guy. Oh, very bright. Oh, I miss him. I
learned a lot from him as far as chemistry and what I do, and then he was just a

14:03.960 --> 14:18.180
pretty nice guy. I saw him last in 1972. Oh, amazing. I'm glad I mentioned it
then because he always talked about Kenyan, and it's a small world. Yeah, I

14:18.180 --> 14:29.100
should say. The Baron, he was really quite a figure there. As far as I remember,
he had three pair of jeans, two T-shirts, one change of linen, and a suit. He

14:29.100 --> 14:40.080
got his good will. I never saw him in his suit. Well, maybe he hadn't got his
good will yet. But that's what I meant to, I'm sure he straightened out from the

14:40.080 --> 14:49.680
time he got out back in the real world, but that's along the lines of what I was
talking about, the eccentricity of the place. Really, first-rate lines. Not

14:49.680 --> 15:01.500
terribly stable, though. Yeah. We had some, we used to play a lot of racquetball
in the summers and had some pretty amazing times at night and got the munchies a

15:01.500 --> 15:14.060
lot at late hours, and that was a good time. I miss Aaron. I'm glad I mentioned
him. Oh, good. Okay. I'll let you go. I appreciate it. I was going to ask you if

15:14.060 --> 15:24.740
I could beg your indulgence. Could I possibly send my four books and have them
autographed? Oh, God, sure. And I will put in the return postage and the label

15:24.740 --> 15:36.880
and all that. No, as well. Very fun. Well, thank you. I do appreciate that. It's
been really nice. I've gotten a kick out of this. It's nice to be able to talk

15:36.880 --> 15:44.960
to the people who might marvel at what they write. And I re-read the stuff. I
don't know how many times I've re-read it now, but I wanted to re-read it this

15:44.960 --> 15:57.060
week. And it's been great. And from a fan, please hurry up and write another
one. That's exactly the encouragement I need. I think you might like the new

15:57.060 --> 16:07.440
one. Can I tell you what it's about? Yeah, we'll go right ahead. Okay, well. The
idea is based upon what happens if for some one reason or another the very

16:07.440 --> 16:17.680
finest portion of humanity simply leaves the planet. For one reason, I don't
know exactly why they get fed up with things, but the very best of the doctors,

16:17.840 --> 16:28.500
scientists, god, I guess even the best lawyers can find them. For over a period
of a few years, they just begin leaving and they're gone and then afterwards

16:28.500 --> 16:38.780
people realize that that, A, they are gone, B, that by leaving, you know, if the
beds have left, then what does that make us, if we're left behind. Even though

16:38.780 --> 16:50.480
that includes, you know, the people who are left behind. The majority, this is
very fine folks. And things after that, either because they left or because

16:50.480 --> 17:02.740
people think this is the result of their leaving, it just it gets grossly worse
and worse and worse. After a period of about 40 or 50 years, however, they

17:02.740 --> 17:10.980
gradually stabilized after a lot of the, you know, the usual chaos in this book.
And that's why the heroes, the Attorney General of what's left the United States

17:10.980 --> 17:23.280
now only goes to Chicago. I'm also having enough guts to actually put the story
in real world bars. And a lot of the, the action revolves not the gift of

17:23.280 --> 17:28.120
leaving, But they were finally getting to calm down when it suddenly turned out
that they're coming back.

17:32.000 --> 17:44.600
Okay. You think you'll submit it to Daw? Well, I was real fortunate. One of
those little stories that when I was a Kenyan. Again, I was not in the English

17:44.600 --> 17:59.200
section because I really thought they were much too intelligent and good for me.
they had a novel to speak to the honors English section I wheedled my way

17:59.200 --> 18:08.700
into a reception couldn't get into the seminar he was running at the time but I
met him and talked to him briefly and we hit it off and discussed some of the

18:08.700 --> 18:21.600
problems because my first one was already coming out by that time he recommended
his agent in New York Malcolm Reese at Paul Reynolds agency, who I then saw. And

18:21.600 --> 18:31.480
as it turned out, Reese, first of all, was just one of the really first-rate
guys, one of the real gentlemen I've met in my life. And he liked science

18:31.480 --> 18:40.360
fiction because he'd edited his fall from the 30s, and unknown to me, his son
had graduated from Kenyon a year or two ahead of me. So we had it off pretty

18:40.360 --> 18:50.720
well, and he tried to peddle. I believe the Daystar didn't get anywhere, and
very graciously turned it back to me to just sell to olheim and not take a

18:50.720 --> 19:04.660
commission and then uh uh then he managed to uh sell uh siege of wonder to
double day uh the gentleman died after that but then his son is now carrying on

19:04.660 --> 19:12.560
and so i've got uh at least i've got a name back there and hopefully they're
remembering and if i get something i'll send it out to them and i'll circulate

19:12.560 --> 19:24.880
around see what happens. Well, great. We'll be watching for it. Well, thanks for
keeping a lookout on the ones you have so far. Okay, thanks. It's been great.

19:25.100 --> 19:36.980
I'll send you the books within a couple of weeks and I do appreciate that. Okay,
great. Have a good trip to Reno and we'll talk to you later, Mark. Great. Good

19:36.980 --> 19:37.840
night, now. Bye.
