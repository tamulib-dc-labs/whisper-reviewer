Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.740 --> 00:34.180
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.660
And here are your hosts.

00:43.380 --> 00:52.700
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. If there's such a thing as a science fiction
connoisseur, he would have to be a Jack Vance fan. Vance is a distinctive author

00:52.700 --> 01:01.060
who's been writing science fiction and fantasy since the 1940s. And even in a
field like science fiction, Vance's imagination is remarkable. His depiction of

01:01.060 --> 01:09.000
alien worlds, for instance, impresses any reader. He has a powerful, subtle
style, and with the colors and textures of his descriptions, and his careful

01:09.000 --> 01:16.440
attention to the resources of language, he can make you believe you're on
another planet, somehow involved in an alien culture. We might mention the

01:16.440 --> 01:26.080
Durdane trilogy, or the Four Novels of the Tschai, or Planet of Adventure series,
as examples of Vance's skill at creating alien environments and cultures. Vance

01:26.080 --> 01:29.500
always wanted to be a writer, and he chose science fiction for the simplest of
reasons.

01:30.900 --> 01:34.240
First, I had a quite the ideal of my life.

01:35.960 --> 01:42.200
I wanted to find some way of making a living where I could travel, be my own boss,

01:42.660 --> 01:52.140
work my own hours, and writing was the way that suggested itself.

01:53.700 --> 02:03.840
And so I kind of, even when I was only 10 or 12 years old,

02:04.500 --> 02:09.720
Well, I told myself I kind of liked to be
a writer, but I chose science fiction. I don't know, or fantasy, whatever you

02:09.720 --> 02:17.220
want to call it. When I was a kid, I'd done a lot of reading. Well, I'd done a
lot of reading in everything as far as I could.

02:21.000 --> 02:38.960
but I think I'm probably more touched by, or not influenced by the word, but
influenced, I guess you might say, by the fantasy and the so-called science

02:38.960 --> 02:49.340
fiction, rather than by much anything else. As we've said, Vance started back in
the 1940s in the pulp magazines, and his early work lacks the polish and

02:49.340 --> 03:01.500
distinctive flair that he's known for. I was learning my trade. I just got
started writing not as real young, you know, like some guys did. In fact, I was

03:01.500 --> 03:13.180
doing lots of other things. And then I decided I was going to be a writer, and I
started writing, and I had all the talents for it, I guess, apparently, but I

03:13.180 --> 03:25.000
didn't have the knack or the practice, or whatever you want to call it, of
putting the words together. And also, I was trying

03:25.000 --> 03:37.820
to write the wrong kind of story. Those days, the gadget story was very big. And
I was wasting a lot of time trying to write gadget stories on scientific

03:37.820 --> 03:56.500
breakthroughs and things like that, which is essentially kind of a lined alley,
I think. And it's a phase of the field which has mercifully gone over the hill.

03:57.300 --> 04:10.300
I've got a very good scientific background. It's not that I don't know science.
I do write. I was going to be a physicist, actually, for a while. In the 40s and

04:10.300 --> 04:27.420
50s, I was writing and experimenting, collecting rejection slips. And that was
an apprentice period in which I

04:27.420 --> 04:42.480
was paid not very much for, but, you know, checked once in a while. Essentially,
those 40s and 50s stories are not much good. They're not worth it. I'll just soon

04:42.480 --> 04:52.320
forget them. Vance's apprenticeship must have been well spent. The science
fiction and fantasy he's been writing ever since is masterful. In 1963, he won

04:52.320 --> 05:01.520
the Hugo Award for The Dragon Masters. And in 1966, he won both the Nebula and
Hugo Awards for The Last Castle. Tomorrow, more with Jack Vance.

05:09.280 --> 05:17.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:17.280 --> 05:18.060
Odessa, Texas.

05:26.200 --> 05:53.020


05:53.020 --> 05:57.700


05:57.700 --> 06:02.280
Coming up next is the Science
Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:17.920 --> 06:23.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.780
And here are your hosts.

06:32.680 --> 06:41.720
This is Daryl Lane and David Crews. Jack Vance has created a unique, vivid, and
fascinating body of science fiction and fantasy. He began his career in the pulp

06:41.720 --> 06:49.480
magazines of the 1940s, and he wrote the gadget stories that were popular then.
But over the years, he's developed a deeper, more subtle, and distinctive type

06:49.480 --> 06:57.500
of science fiction and fantasy. Yet the curious fact is that not many people,
even science fiction readers, have heard of Jack Vance. We asked him why he

06:57.500 --> 07:13.560
thought that was so. I think another thing, too, that I've developed rather
gradually and reached my presence, whatever you want to call it, by a kind of

07:13.560 --> 07:21.180
back way, inconspicuously. Clark is known for it in 2001.

07:23.480 --> 07:29.360
Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land, or whatever, children's books, or through
Campbell.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.360
And it's, uh...

07:40.060 --> 07:53.000
I've never been associated with anything that had any other publicity attached
to it. So that I just seemed to arrive on the scene. So it seems to me, if I

07:53.000 --> 08:08.500
were looking at my own career in this way, and then kind of quietly from, from,
uh, northeast somewhere. Rather than, uh, through, through having a movie or, or

08:08.500 --> 08:18.480
something or so. Lately, Vance has been writing three, four, and even five novel
series set on alien planets. He's noted for his imaginative descriptions of

08:18.480 --> 08:26.520
alien settings and cultures more than anything else. The four books in the Tschai
series, or the Durdane trilogy, are good examples of stories set in convincingly

08:26.520 --> 08:34.920
alien environments. Vance is also recognized for the stories in the Dying Earth
series. And don't forget, Vance has written excellent mystery fiction, even

08:34.920 --> 08:43.600
winning the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1960, for his
book, The Man in the Cage. Even though some readers talk of a unique Vance

08:43.600 --> 08:55.660
style, Vance himself says he has no particular style or writing characteristics.
I don't have any style. All I do is try to write whatever in the best possible

08:55.660 --> 09:08.340
way. Now, if, uh, you take the trouble to read, uh, some of my murder mysteries,
you'll find that they're, they're written in a different way. Everything you

09:08.340 --> 09:20.200
write, everything I write, everything anybody writes, the style, or the way the
words are put together, is part of the mood of the story. It, uh, it is part of

09:20.200 --> 09:32.120
the story itself. It's part of the complete, completed product. Now, when you
say, uh, why did I, how did I evolve this? That, that, that implies that I have

09:32.120 --> 09:49.940
one style that I use for everything from, uh, this, uh, early Dying Earth thing,
up to, uh, one of, well, this mystery story, uh, with locale in the countryside

09:49.940 --> 09:59.180
out here, called Fox Valley Murders. If you take the trouble to examine the way
the words are put together, you'll find it totally different. Also, like, is Bad

09:59.180 --> 10:09.760
Ronald, which is a suspense story. The way that the words go together are
different from the way the words go together, and you say, uh, oh, I don't know

10:09.760 --> 10:13.760
what. No, I don't have any style. 

10:19.800 --> 10:28.720
Vance considers himself a storyteller or entertainer, with no access to
grind. He's reluctant to provide explanations or analyses of his work. When

10:28.720 --> 10:37.260
asked about a particular character or episode in one of his works, Vance has a
characteristic reply. Well, I think everyone will have to answer that to

10:37.260 --> 10:45.220
themselves. Reading the science fiction of Jack Vance makes answering questions
like that worthwhile. More with Jack Vance tomorrow.

10:52.380 --> 11:00.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

11:00.420 --> 11:01.200
Odessa, Texas.

11:37.280 --> 11:37.580


11:41.620 --> 11:45.700
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:01.640 --> 12:06.940
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.380
And here are your hosts.

12:15.940 --> 12:25.080
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. The Dying Earth stories of Jack Vance, one
of the most exquisite creations in the realm of science fantasy. The setting for

12:25.080 --> 12:33.820
the stories is a bit unusual. It's Earth, but an Earth so many millions of
centuries into the future that it's almost dead. And so is the sun, sputtering

12:33.820 --> 12:41.840
like a candle ready to go out and bathing Earth in its final pale red light.
There are only a few people left on Earth, and most of these are sorcerers,

12:41.980 --> 12:51.880
since magic works and science has been forgotten. Vance says the dying Earth
stories are some of the earliest things he ever wrote. Well, the funny thing

12:51.880 --> 13:04.260
about it is that was written before I started selling. That was written at sea.
It was merchant sealant. And I had quite a bit of spare time, and I began

13:04.260 --> 13:10.520
writing these flamboyant,

13:10.600 --> 13:27.880
highly colored stories. But those were written, oh, very, very early. They were
written before I started selling. So they're just representative of a kind of

13:27.880 --> 13:31.080
rather early stage.

13:32.400 --> 13:45.140
And then when I started writing this so-called gadget fiction or other stuff, I
changed the style. The style of the Dying Earth stuff wasn't at all suitable for

13:45.140 --> 13:57.980
writing the stuff I began selling. The stuff I was selling was any good, because
it wasn't. But at least the style of the Dying Earth would have been absolutely,

13:58.220 --> 14:02.640
what's

14:02.640 --> 14:07.040
the word, incongruous. It wouldn't have fitted for any different style.

14:18.700 --> 14:26.680
Many readers believe the style of the stories, which Vance calls flamboyant and
highly colored, to be the most marvelous and vivid thing about them. It creates

14:26.680 --> 14:34.560
an exotic yet wistful atmosphere, somehow appropriate for a world on the edge of
extinction. Tim Underwood is a friend of Vance's, and along with Chuck Miller,

14:34.820 --> 14:42.480
publishes Vance's work in specially made collector's editions. The Underwood
Miller Publishing Company's first book was the Dying Earth. We asked Tim

14:42.480 --> 14:57.200
Underwood why. A lot of science fiction and fantasy, and sometimes the best of
it, does not get published in hardcover editions. And the Dying Earth was the

14:57.200 --> 15:11.140
first book we did, and it was just a book that is essentially a classic. It was
published in 1950 as a paperback, and it had never been in hardcover, and it's

15:11.140 --> 15:20.640
one of the outstanding books in the fantasy field, and 200 years from now people
will be reading it. And it had never been in a durable hardcover edition, and so

15:20.640 --> 15:21.420
we put it in one.

15:28.980 --> 15:37.640
Vance didn't write any new Dying Earth material for 15 years after the book's
original publication in 1950. We asked him if it was perhaps reader responses

15:37.640 --> 15:53.160
which caused him to take it up again. No, it's been, I don't, I just, well, we
wanted to do some more stuff in there. And this character was swarming around in

15:53.160 --> 15:53.580
my head.

16:10.680 --> 16:18.700
The character swarming around in his head was Cugel, a picaresque rogue who
survives on the Dying Earth through his wits and his nimble fingers. The Kugel

16:18.700 --> 16:27.320
stories were collected in 1966 in a book entitled The Eyes of the Overworld.
Since then, Vance has written other Cugel stories and says he'll do more in the

16:27.320 --> 16:31.800
future, so the Dying Earth isn't dead yet. More on Jack Vance tomorrow.

16:39.320 --> 16:47.200

17:48.220 --> 17:53.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.920
And here are your hosts.

18:02.260 --> 18:10.660
This is Daryl Lane and David Crews. Jack Vance is one of the major talents that
the field of fantasy and science fiction has produced. Tim Underwood, his friend

18:10.660 --> 18:21.940
and publisher, offers some reasons why. I think Jack has accomplished some
things with some of his works that have never been done before. And not only in

18:21.940 --> 18:23.660
terms of style, but in terms of feeling.

18:27.900 --> 18:41.540
He hearkens to a certain spirit, I think. I mean, a certain kind of person or a
certain kind of spirit is on his wavelength and responds strongly to his work.

18:43.240 --> 18:54.040
But the latter part of his work and the best of his work is extremely well
crafted. He's a craftsman, very well written, and accomplishes a lot of really

18:54.040 --> 19:03.460
unusual things in a very quiet way. Vance's accomplishments have been
impressive. His science fiction career spans almost 40 years and began back in

19:03.460 --> 19:11.520
the pulp era. He's won the major awards for a science fiction and fantasy
writer. One is the Hugo Award, awarded by readers, and the other is a Nebula

19:11.520 --> 19:19.520
Award, given by other writers. Some of his best-known work includes The Dying
Earth stories, which go all the way back to his beginnings as a writer in the

19:19.520 --> 19:33.680
40s, and more recently, The Five Demon Princes novels. Still, Vance hasn't
received much recognition. We asked Underwood why. My feeling is that one

19:33.680 --> 19:50.060
responds strongly to Vance, one who feels much the same way about the world that
he does. I think, why isn't he, though, as popular as, say, John Lycoray, who I

19:50.060 --> 20:04.740
think people respond to in the same way? Well, Vance is more of a rarefied
taste, I think, is the kind of things that he feels are important. The

20:04.740 --> 20:16.500
strangeness in the world about us and the unusual qualities of life itself,
those kind of considerations are not important to a lot of people. People who do

20:16.500 --> 20:26.560
feel these things strongly are going to like what Vance writes. They're going to
enjoy reading. They're going to enjoy the worlds that he's created. He's not

20:26.560 --> 20:38.940
done a lot of the things that make other writers successful, like he's never
stayed with one character, the way that, say, Laker Ray stayed with Smiley, or

20:38.940 --> 20:56.500
the way that someone writes a Doc Savage novel 15 times in a row or whatever. He
hasn't done that. And he hasn't had one hero that he's repeated for any great

20:56.500 --> 21:11.480
number of books, and he hasn't had one contemporary theme that appeals to
people, like the battle of the sexes or something like that. Those aren't Jack's

21:11.480 --> 21:23.780
themes. Jack's considerations and themes are enormously subtle and kind of a
rarefied nature. Vance has always been reluctant to discuss his own work or to

21:23.780 --> 21:35.600
offer any insights into his themes or intentions. Underwood suggests a reason.
Jack always says that he wants his work to stand for and by itself. I think he

21:35.600 --> 21:48.580
just wants to be remembered for his work. He refuses to pick favorites among his
work. I know he likes his Demon Prince series a lot for good reason. He likes

21:48.580 --> 22:03.200
The Palace of Love, which is the third in that series. He likes The Eyes of the
Overworld, the sequenced stories of the fellow Kugel. And that's partly because

22:03.200 --> 22:17.860
Kugel's a rascal, and Vance is often a bit of a rascal, and Kugel's even more
so. He's the kind of rascal that Vance would like to be if he wasn't such a nice

22:17.860 --> 22:18.560
guy at heart.

22:25.800 --> 22:33.820
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

23:14.860 --> 23:18.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:34.400 --> 23:39.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.160
And here are your hosts.

23:48.320 --> 23:57.340
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. In 1975, a science fiction and fantasy
publishing company was formed because two men wanted to get one particular

23:57.340 --> 24:04.360
science fantasy book between hardcovers. Tim Underwood, one of the men,
explains. In 1975,

24:07.060 --> 24:18.180
I decided I wanted to publish a book. Specifically, I wanted to publish The
Dying Earth in a hardcover form. And I was a used book dealer, and Chuck Miller

24:18.180 --> 24:29.520
was a used book dealer, dealing in rare and out-of-print books and some new
material. And we knew of each other. And I think we had bought and sold books

24:29.520 --> 24:41.940
from each other from time to time. And Chuck heard about, I may have mentioned
in a letter about The Dying Earth, and Chuck offered his expertise because he

24:41.940 --> 24:53.580
knew a good deal about certain parts of publishing industry, about distribution
and that end of it. And my experience, my limited experience, had to do with

24:53.580 --> 25:06.300
just graphically putting a book together. And so he suggested that we do the
book together. And so we did. And the interesting thing is that we never met

25:06.300 --> 25:12.580
each other until the book had already been published. And that was a year later
in 1976.

25:15.080 --> 25:27.240
And up to that time, we were literally exchanging thousands of dollars to the
mail and doing business without ever having met each other. We were, in a sense,

25:27.340 --> 25:37.100
complete strangers. But we had this one connection, and that is we both felt
strongly about this one work of Vance's The Dying Earth and about Vance's work

25:37.100 --> 25:47.100
in general and about, specifically about fantasy and science fiction and horror
and literature. Since that first book, the Underwood Miller Company has

25:47.100 --> 25:55.820
published some 50 books, all science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Their print
runs for each volume average 1,000 copies, hardly enough to compete with the

25:55.820 --> 26:06.140
large New York publishers. Underwood explains why. We're selling to collectors,
and the collectors are buying these books with the knowledge that they're going

26:06.140 --> 26:22.520
to go out of print and become valuable later on. Another reason is that Chuck
and I don't own a warehouse, and we are not in business to have a large

26:22.520 --> 26:32.620
inventory. We couldn't. We would make more money if we printed more books,
because as you print more books, the cost per book of manufacturing goes down

26:32.620 --> 26:33.280
dramatically.

26:36.980 --> 26:46.560
But we just simply can't afford to have a lot of books in inventory sitting
around. We can't afford it. Our books go out of print in about nine months, and

26:46.560 --> 26:57.000
this is just the opposite of a major manufacturer, like Dutton or Brown or
someone like that. They want their book to stay in print as long as possible,

26:57.580 --> 27:00.580
and we want our books to go out of print as soon as possible.

27:08.100 --> 27:16.980
Tim Underwood and Chuck Miller have a sincere interest in significant works of
science fiction and fantasy. It's just the pleasure of bookmaking. Just the

27:16.980 --> 27:28.660
pleasure. Chuck and I both take a great pleasure in making a good book, a book
that has its signature sewn, which is something that doesn't occur in general

27:28.660 --> 27:39.960
trade hardcover publishing anymore, a book that's printed on acid-free paper so
that in 20 or 30 years the paper won't turn brittle and brown, and just a well

27:39.960 --> 27:50.200
-made, well-bound book, attractively made and artistically put together. And
publishing a book like that, creating a book like that, is really a pleasure.

27:51.540 --> 27:58.600
Underwood and Miller are publishing books by many authors in beautifully
illustrated editions now. Anyone who likes fantasy and science fiction, and

27:58.600 --> 28:02.140
anyone who likes books, should search out some of their work and hold on to it.
