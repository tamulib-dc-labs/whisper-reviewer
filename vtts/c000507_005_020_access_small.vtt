Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.080
And here are your hosts.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.240
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

00:44.460 --> 00:47.860
Theodore Sturgeon is one of the finest writers science fiction and fantasy has ever produced.

00:48.280 --> 00:52.400
For 45 years Sturgeon has created imaginative fiction that is noted for its innovative themes

00:52.400 --> 00:53.440
and perfection of style.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.520
A large percentage of his works have become classics in the field.

00:57.080 --> 01:00.940
His novel More Than Human, for example, are the powerful short story Thunder and Roses.

01:00.940 --> 01:04.260
We spoke with Sturgeon recently and asked him to tell us how he became a writer.

01:04.920 --> 01:10.040
I began to write when I was an able seaman in the Virgin Marine.

01:11.420 --> 01:16.000
And how that came about was that I left home before I graduated from high school.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.020
It's a fascinating thing.

01:18.240 --> 01:23.300
I lecture at colleges and universities all over the United States and in England and in

01:23.300 --> 01:27.300
France and I have yet to get my high school diploma.

01:28.340 --> 01:30.980
Someday somebody will grant me an honorary high school diploma.

01:32.340 --> 01:35.600
But anyway, I was on the ship and you had a lot of time to read.

01:36.380 --> 01:42.420
And I conceived the idea of an absolutely foolproof crime that would net me thousands and thousands of dollars.

01:42.980 --> 01:44.560
And I even did research on it.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.400
I was on a coast-wise tanker.

01:47.880 --> 01:54.620
And as I was going up and down the coast, when we stopped at a port, I would send off a letter to the railroad.

01:54.620 --> 01:56.340
So it was one of those things that was involved.

01:56.620 --> 01:59.740
And the insurance companies, that was another in the Post Office, that was still another.

01:59.840 --> 02:04.300
I got all my research done as to how to commit this particular kind of robbery.

02:06.160 --> 02:10.560
And they let it carefully written so that nobody would know what I was up to.

02:12.020 --> 02:17.620
And when I had all my material, I found that I did not have the immoral courage to commit the crime.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.540
So I wrote it as a story.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.120
This was way back in the late 30s.

02:25.340 --> 02:28.400
And I sent my story off to a newspaper syndicate.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.160
I did not know anything about writing particularly.

02:31.560 --> 02:37.960
And they were buying 1500-word short, short stories that they published every day in the syndicate.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.000
And when I got up to New York in the ship, to my amazement, I got a letter of acceptance.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.920
And so I quit the sea and came ashore to be a writer.

02:50.480 --> 02:55.140
And I got my money not on acceptance, but on publication.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.260
And it was five whole dollars.

02:58.460 --> 03:02.500
And they would buy one and sometimes two stories a week, but no more.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.120
And so four and a half months or so, I lived on five and sometimes ten dollars a week.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.200
My room cost me seven.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.040
And whatever I saved, I could eat.

03:12.040 --> 03:16.740
And I learned a lot about being hungry and how to...

03:16.740 --> 03:20.160
Did you ever notice that the counter cake has no crust on the ends?

03:22.400 --> 03:26.240
That's what they do is chop them off and they sell them in their day-old store.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.240
And at that time you could get a whole shopping bag full of cake ends for a nickel.

03:31.260 --> 03:33.080
And I used to live on that.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.160
One time I got a whole shopping bag full and it was moldy, but I ate it anyhow.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.920
And I was so sick I didn't eat for three days, and so I saved myself some money.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.740
You know, like that.

03:43.340 --> 03:45.320
It was a hard school. It really was.

04:01.140 --> 04:04.520
Sturgeon persisted as a writer, though, earning his living writing pulp fiction.

04:05.060 --> 04:08.700
And pulp fiction, we should add, that surpassed almost anything else coming out in the pulp format.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.380
Then Sturgeon met someone who gave his career a big boost.

04:12.060 --> 04:19.100
Then I finally, after some months of that, and I think I went back to sea for a short while,

04:20.600 --> 04:25.240
I finally met John Campbell in 1939, early 1939.

04:26.240 --> 04:31.760
He was the editor of astounding science fiction and a wonderful fantasy magazine called Unknown.

04:33.440 --> 04:38.180
And so I started writing for him, and then after that it just exploded.

04:39.080 --> 04:45.400
One time I had four stories on the stands at the same time, and those two magazines, I had to get two new names.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.900
So it was an interesting beginning.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.660
On our next show we'll continue our conversation with Theodore Sturgeon.

05:00.180 --> 05:06.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:06.380 --> 05:09.260
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.640
Theodore Sturgeon

05:53.640 --> 05:54.240
Stay with us.

06:09.880 --> 06:15.160
This is The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:17.820 --> 06:19.480
And here are your hosts.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.480
This is Daryl Lane.

06:24.700 --> 06:25.400
And David Carson.

06:25.800 --> 06:30.320
Much of Theodore Sturgeon's early science fiction and fantasy was published in the pulp magazines of the 30s and 40s.

06:30.900 --> 06:34.260
Yet Sturgeon is known as one of the finest stylists science fiction has ever produced,

06:34.560 --> 06:37.560
and the pulps were not exactly a seedbed for perfection of style.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.940
When we spoke with Sturgeon we observed that he hardly belongs to the pulp category.

06:41.480 --> 06:46.800
Well you know, this is difficultly with a whole matter of categorization anyway.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.700
We're in the grip of the taxonomist.

06:50.940 --> 06:55.040
And people who put labels on things and stick them into cubby holes.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.400
Taxonomy has its uses. There's no question about that.

06:59.960 --> 07:04.100
You have to be able to find and retrieve information and that's what taxonomy is all about.

07:04.820 --> 07:09.080
But more and more there seems to come over our whole culture,

07:09.080 --> 07:12.200
the idea that if you can put a label on it you understand it.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.740
And that is not what taxonomy is for.

07:15.020 --> 07:18.400
Taxonomy is handles by which you can pick something up and look at it.

07:19.120 --> 07:24.560
But for so many people in so many ways the label is sufficient.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.320
You know, he's a Republican.

07:26.780 --> 07:32.740
His mother was a Jew or, yeah, he's a poet.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.160
He's an ethnic or whatever.

07:34.160 --> 07:39.880
They're all labels and it's a little effort made to understand what's under these labels.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.120
Pulp fictions have suffered from the same thing.

07:43.820 --> 07:47.840
Pulp actually referred to the kind of paper it was printed on, not to its quality.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.540
There was the pulps and there were the slicks.

07:50.660 --> 07:55.560
The slicks from magazines like The Saturday Evening Post and Collier's and The Hone Journal.

07:56.420 --> 08:01.700
Then the pulps were things like black masks and Air Wars stories and science fiction and fantasy and the like.

08:03.080 --> 08:09.440
But it's so easy for the taxonomists and for people who don't pay proper attention to what was going on

08:09.440 --> 08:14.880
to feel that pulp was a qualitative comment and slick was also qualitative.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.600
Slicked paper was better in literature than pulp paper.

08:19.160 --> 08:24.000
Some of the finest writing around is some of the best pulp writers as such.

08:24.300 --> 08:29.340
I mean, the best writers of the time began in pulp and they only gravitated to the slicks,

08:29.340 --> 08:31.720
not because they got better but because they got paid more.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.560
Red Bradbury is a perfect example of that.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.220
So is Dashiell Hammett and the like.

08:41.300 --> 08:44.200
We asked Sturgeon why he devoted himself to science fiction and fantasy.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.820
Why didn't he write regular or mainstream fiction?

08:47.480 --> 08:49.480
Well, first of all because I love the field.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.840
Because it's the only genre which has no limitations whatsoever.

08:54.980 --> 08:57.560
A lot of people there, the taxonomists are into it again.

08:57.560 --> 09:01.200
They feel that science fiction is the literature of the future and of space.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.460
Which is nonsense. It's true that a lot of it is.

09:04.620 --> 09:07.200
But you can write science fiction about the past.

09:07.420 --> 09:10.420
You can write science fiction about that marvelous place called other.

09:10.940 --> 09:14.720
Just another place that doesn't have any reference to where we go in the future.

09:16.760 --> 09:17.660
That's the best kind.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.580
That's the kind that I think one of the things that science fiction is for.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.200
If you don't like the government, go ahead and create a new kind of government.

09:24.340 --> 09:25.600
Give it a push and see how it works.

09:26.920 --> 09:32.840
You can study whole cultures and religions and also literature and art.

09:33.620 --> 09:35.460
I've gone into that in some of my stories.

09:36.060 --> 09:38.420
Which are essentially in places that occur just other.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.280
Not in the future or in the past necessarily.

09:41.880 --> 09:48.080
One of the very finest science fiction books around is by somebody I'm very proud to call one of my ex-students.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.960
It's called Wild Seed. It's by Octavia Butler.

09:52.720 --> 09:57.760
And it begins somewhere around the 17th century and goes up to about 1910.

09:58.540 --> 10:00.180
Which is highly future fiction.

10:01.300 --> 10:07.240
The totally original structure, original idea and beautifully written.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.080
That lady is tremendous. She really is. One of the big ones.

10:12.940 --> 10:17.520
When Sturgeon began publishing his fiction back in the late 30s, science fiction had not yet exploded.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.620
Most of it was still published in pulp magazines rather than books.

10:20.620 --> 10:25.840
The pulp authors were often writers who also wrote westerns, adventure fiction, detectives and so forth.

10:26.200 --> 10:31.300
Sturgeon contributed greatly to the growing popularity of science fiction and indeed helped usher it into its golden age.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.340
We'll talk about such matters on our next show.

10:40.420 --> 10:45.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

10:46.020 --> 10:48.900
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

10:48.900 --> 11:05.500
Music plays

11:32.600 --> 11:33.720
Music plays

11:33.720 --> 11:37.320
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.240
Music plays

11:52.000 --> 11:53.280
Music plays

11:53.280 --> 11:58.320
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.600
And here are your hosts.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.680
Music plays

12:06.680 --> 12:07.960
This is David Carson.

12:08.120 --> 12:08.760
And Daryl Lane.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.840
Theatre Sturgeon has influenced science fiction as few other writers have.

12:11.840 --> 12:18.700
He began publishing science fiction and fantasy in the late 1930s and quickly became recognized as one of the most unique stylists and thinkers in the field.

12:19.100 --> 12:22.200
We asked him if he associated with any other writers in those early days.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.620
Was there any sense of community or fellowship among science fiction writers?

12:26.340 --> 12:32.620
Oh sure. I am characteristically not a joiner as such.

12:32.620 --> 12:36.460
There was a group called the Hydro Club which was completely informal.

12:37.940 --> 12:41.460
And the rule one was that there are no rules for this organization.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.980
And an awful lot of people belong to the Hydro Club.

12:45.640 --> 12:55.460
And through that in the early years I got to know all sorts of people like Horace Golden and Fred Polan, Henry Cutner and so on.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.820
Well, the whole raft with those early writers, I think I knew them all.

13:01.600 --> 13:06.460
And there was a group there, Fred Polan's written about them called the Futurians.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.700
I was never involved in that particularly.

13:09.520 --> 13:15.280
I attended the very first Milford Science Fiction Writers Conference in Milford, New Jersey.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.900
I guess that was in 1951.

13:18.740 --> 13:21.140
And Judith Merrill, I was very close to.

13:23.820 --> 13:29.220
I knew virtually everybody in the field at that time except one or two of the West Coast people.

13:37.880 --> 13:43.960
Back in the 40s, Sturgeon's style and his innovative themes were startingly fresh in a field that was noted for its cliches and formulas.

13:43.960 --> 13:53.480
Science fiction author, critic and historian James Gunn has written that because of Theodore Sturgeon, other writers have been freer to write what they wish to write and were able to find a market for it.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.760
We wondered if Sturgeon were conscious of himself as having that kind of role.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.000
Not at all. Not at all.

13:59.880 --> 14:04.100
I tell you, the last few years have been real revelations to me.

14:06.480 --> 14:14.380
For one thing, I didn't realize that I had had so much personal impact on people until what was it, six years or so.

14:14.900 --> 14:24.040
Now, I went to Italy and a woman came up to me dragging an interpreter and the interpreter said, she doesn't speak any English, but there are two things that she wants to tell you.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.340
One of them is that you write women better than any other writer she knows.

14:28.180 --> 14:34.300
And the other thing is that because of something that you wrote, she did not kill herself one night.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.680
And the woman began to cry and the interpreter began to cry and I began to cry.

14:40.860 --> 14:42.800
And it was quite an experience.

14:43.900 --> 14:52.740
I suddenly realized that what I have done, apparently, I've been able to reach a great many people far deeper than I had any idea that I was doing.

14:52.740 --> 15:02.120
When I look back over the mail that I've gotten over the years, I realize how many people in how many different ways have told me that same kind of thing.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.220
It's extremely gratifying. It's also a little frightening.

15:05.940 --> 15:11.940
I mean, it's frightening enough to make you terrified or touching your typewriter.

15:13.240 --> 15:19.340
Barry Malzberg, another author and critic of science fiction, has called Sturgeon the most important science fiction writer of the 40s.

15:19.340 --> 15:27.600
Malzberg says that because of Sturgeon's style, his internalization or use of psychology in his quirky characters, he opened the door for everything that happened in the 50s.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.580
Sturgeon read Malzberg's assessment. His response is interesting.

15:31.140 --> 15:39.320
Yeah, I'll tell you quickly a story. A few years ago, there was a little boy who went to see his buddy. He was 67 years old.

15:39.820 --> 15:46.240
His mother told him back to be back before dark. And he was so busy playing with his friend that he looked out the window and saw it was dark.

15:46.240 --> 15:55.320
And he went rushing home. And like little kids will, he dragged his stick along a picket fence and when he got to the corner, he whined it against the lamp post.

15:55.780 --> 16:01.320
And immediately all the lights in the northeastern United States went out. Remember that one? That big blackout?

16:02.660 --> 16:06.280
He went rushing home to his mother, weeping and threw himself into her arms.

16:06.820 --> 16:13.740
And said, God, mommy, I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. But this is the way I felt when I first read things like this.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.140
More with Theodore Sturgeon next time.

17:15.260 --> 17:19.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:35.020 --> 17:40.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.600
And here are your hosts.

17:48.740 --> 17:49.760
This is Daryl Lane.

17:49.980 --> 17:50.640
And David Carson.

17:51.160 --> 17:55.340
Theodore Sturgeon is known as one of the finest short story writers who has ever written science fiction and fantasy.

17:55.800 --> 18:00.120
But he's also published novels. One of them, More Than Human, is a genuine science fiction classic.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.180
It came out in 1953 and won the International Fantasy Award in 1954.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.500
More Than Human is really three interconnected stories dealing with extra sensory powers.

18:08.500 --> 18:16.820
It depicts Sturgeon's impressionistic style, the coming together of six freaks, children who have latent side powers, but who are lost and ineffectual when they are alone.

18:17.260 --> 18:23.540
But as a group, a gestalt that functions as a single organism, they succeed and become symbolic of a new level of human maturity.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.320
Sturgeon talks about More Than Human.

18:25.900 --> 18:31.560
The springboard for that was in a book by Pearl Buck, which was called The Vision of Women.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.400
I read it so many years ago that I hardly remember the book at all.

18:35.260 --> 18:41.360
But there was one passage in there which described a monk who took care of some children in a cave in the woods.

18:41.940 --> 18:45.700
And they were uneducated and wild children that have died without him.

18:46.380 --> 18:51.340
And he was just an impoverished monk himself, and he took care of these raggedy little children.

18:51.980 --> 18:53.440
That image always stayed with me.

18:54.440 --> 19:09.100
And somehow that and the whole idea of what would happen if each of these children, coming from various places and being various kinds of children, had very special ESP talents.

19:10.300 --> 19:23.920
And again, it was a question of investigating what the impact would be on the world as a whole, as some of the newly recognized activities of the human mind came up.

19:25.320 --> 19:29.520
And this, of course, is, there are literally thousands of books that have been written on that theme since then.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.960
Sturgeon says the book has been his most popular among readers.

19:33.560 --> 19:40.500
When I sold Finnish and Israeli rights two years ago, it got into its 15th and 16th languages.

19:41.220 --> 19:44.520
And just how many editions I have, no idea, genuinely not.

19:45.320 --> 19:52.080
I know there are five or six English editions and several Spanish and a number of French and four Japanese editions.

19:52.400 --> 20:01.360
And I think I'm proudest of all of that if a novel can pass the language barrier and the cultural barrier and go into more editions.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.500
And I think that's a real achievement.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.900
Another Sturgeon novel is Venus Plus X, the book's strong on ideas.

20:14.440 --> 20:20.000
And the main idea is sexual stereotyping in our society, the seemingly predetermined roles men and women must take on.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.720
Sturgeon talks about the impetus behind Venus Plus X.

20:22.720 --> 20:31.540
That came about by I was leafing through a magazine and I saw an ad for a Volting's tire chain, weed tire chains.

20:32.500 --> 20:37.880
And there was a photograph of a girl in her underwear holding out a tire chain.

20:39.080 --> 20:43.240
And it stopped me calling. I said, what on earth has that got to do with a tire chain?

20:45.300 --> 20:50.900
Clearly, you know, it was a, it was a grabber by the advertising business that made you stop and look at the ad.

20:50.900 --> 20:55.060
But what has the girl with the clothes I've got to do with a tire chain?

20:55.940 --> 21:03.700
And I began to think, what kind of a civilization, what would it be like to live in a culture where there was no, there's no particular sexual bias at all?

21:04.340 --> 21:11.060
And so I started, first of all, creating a society in which there was no sexual at all.

21:11.820 --> 21:17.360
That people were, they generated like oysters, which can be both either male or female.

21:17.360 --> 21:22.380
But at the beginning, they're neither. And I couldn't make that work.

21:23.160 --> 21:30.220
So I went in another direction and created a race of people and each individual was both sexes.

21:32.820 --> 21:36.520
And therefore there was no sexual differentiation. They were just people.

21:37.720 --> 21:45.160
And it got into their love and marriage, their sexuality, also into their art, their literature, their architecture.

21:46.640 --> 21:52.900
And so, and I had a ball with that. Venus plus sex is not, you know, really a novel at all. It's a, it's a tractor.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.620
It's an exposition of the ideas that I was getting at the time.

21:57.180 --> 21:59.920
We'll continue our conversation with Theodore Sturgeon next time.

22:06.580 --> 22:15.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.020
Coming up next is The Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:23.600 --> 23:28.900
This is The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.200
And here are your hosts.

23:37.280 --> 23:43.060
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane, Science Fiction author Theodore Sturgeon as justly famous as an innovator.

23:43.480 --> 23:50.440
His innovations have come in various areas, but perhaps the most important is his introduction into the science fiction of themes that had never before been treated by the genre.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.680
Right. Taboo themes such as homosexuality and incest, among others.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.220
We ask Sturgeon if he deliberately shattered taboos.

23:58.160 --> 24:10.380
Yes, I have purposely broken taboos. And you know, I wrote the first stories in science fiction about homosexuality, for example, which dealt with homosexuality and with incest.

24:10.780 --> 24:15.260
And I had a three-prouder in omnie last year which dealt with cannibalism.

24:16.220 --> 24:21.300
But these stories were not about homosexuality and about incest and about cannibalism.

24:21.300 --> 24:29.000
And essentially they were about confrontation. All my life I've been infuriated by people who shuck away from an idea.

24:29.140 --> 24:33.940
I don't want to hear about that. Oh, don't tell me that. I don't want to hear it. You know, that always angers me.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.440
Because only by confrontation can we really learn anything.

24:38.740 --> 24:47.520
The whole history of, well, a subject like masturbation, for example, which absolutely terrified the three or four generations before mine,

24:47.520 --> 24:57.500
and preoccupied them too. The inventor of one of our more famous breakfast foods, he was a nutritional doctor.

24:58.580 --> 25:02.800
And he used to write in the Dietary and Medical Advice books for the home.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.520
And about 75% of them has to do with masturbation.

25:06.980 --> 25:13.520
And now it will make your hair fall out and give you a softening of the brain and tuberculosis and cancer and all kinds of things.

25:15.140 --> 25:25.320
Nowadays, with a little confrontation and a little research and study, you can read in the highest level of women's magazines,

25:25.860 --> 25:32.340
not only how to do it, but how to do it well. And it's become a totally accepted practice.

25:33.280 --> 25:41.540
But the horror that went on, because people would not confront it, would not find out what the truth was, caused so much frightful damage.

25:41.540 --> 25:55.080
I mean, people committed suicide over that. I had a relative whose whole life was absolutely made hell by his preoccupation with that.

25:56.480 --> 26:05.940
To be tempted and finally to yield and then feel guilty and feel guilty and so guilty that he would never tell anybody about it, it wrecked his whole life.

26:06.820 --> 26:07.860
Now people have got to confront.

26:08.960 --> 26:13.300
Sturgeon has confronted many controversial or painful ideas in his novels and short stories.

26:13.620 --> 26:15.320
He continues to tell us why he does so.

26:37.860 --> 26:42.940
So often people ask the next question, the one that follows and the one that follows until they suddenly come to a question.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.900
They don't want to ask because they're afraid they might get the answer.

26:46.680 --> 26:52.180
And there they stop. And then when you stop asking the next question, you die. You become a zombie.

26:52.920 --> 26:57.980
And join the ranks of the zombies you see marching around you where you've stopped asking the next question.

26:58.200 --> 27:05.000
It's a very symbol of life and of progress and of science and everything toward basic truth.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.220
When you ever reach basic truth, you'll find not a thing or a precept, but you'll find a process.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.680
You'll find something going on.

27:14.320 --> 27:17.200
And this is the way I've been thinking apparently all my life.

27:17.540 --> 27:23.100
I get very, very irritated when I find that people refuse to think beyond a certain point.

27:23.980 --> 27:30.020
There's a bumper sticker that goes around in the Bible Belt. God said it. I believe it. That settles it.

27:31.040 --> 27:34.840
When you see a bumper sticker like that, you just heard the crash of a closing mind.

27:36.340 --> 27:40.120
There's plenty of room out there to confront the whole idea of God and to go on with it.

27:40.440 --> 27:45.660
And that's the next question and the question that follows without committing any particular kind of sin.

27:53.100 --> 27:58.360
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

27:58.360 --> 28:01.540
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
