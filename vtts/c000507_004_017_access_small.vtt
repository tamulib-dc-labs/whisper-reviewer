00:08.720 --> 00:12.620
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.440 --> 00:33.740
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.220 --> 00:38.060
And here are your hosts.

00:50.180 --> 00:54.600
After writing nearly a hundred short stories, O'Donnell moved on to writing novels, and

00:54.600 --> 00:55.880
so far he's written six.

00:56.380 --> 01:01.220
These include Bandersnatch, Mayflies, War of Emission, and the Journeys of McGill Fian

01:01.220 --> 01:03.580
series, Caverns, Rees, and Lava.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.980
O'Donnell spent a good deal of time in Korea before and after college, and he majored in

01:07.980 --> 01:09.120
Chinese Studies at college.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.920
We asked him if having lived in the Orient influences his writing.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.920
Mayflies is O'Donnell's second novel.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.140
It's the story of a generation ship conveying thousands of settlers to a far destination.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.940
But the focus is on the computer that guides the ship.

03:21.340 --> 03:25.060
You see its core is a living human brain that has retained the memories of the time it was

03:25.060 --> 03:26.880
in the body of Dr. Gerard Medeclura.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.460
O'Donnell explains the genesis of this concept.

03:30.400 --> 03:36.620
Mayflies started all this, actually it was a workshop exercise.

03:37.100 --> 03:46.060
I was at the time in a workshop here in New Haven, and we had to do, oh I forget, a two-paragraph

03:46.060 --> 03:47.980
description of someone.

03:49.300 --> 03:58.280
And I described this character, Medeclura, who took more than the two paragraphs to describe

03:58.280 --> 03:58.560
the character.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.100
And I began on for about a page, and all of a sudden he died.

04:03.340 --> 04:07.380
And I took it into the workshop, and people said, well yes, those are nice paragraphs

04:07.380 --> 04:10.740
and very good description, but boy what have you done here?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.860
You've created a character and then killed him.

04:13.100 --> 04:13.460
What a waste.

04:14.040 --> 04:17.720
I got angry and said, well, you know, maybe I killed him, but it's not a waste.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.160
But I can make something of him.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.780
And they said, we dare you.

04:23.180 --> 04:28.040
And pretty soon Mayflies was underway with me trying to prove you could write a book about

04:28.040 --> 04:29.800
a protagonist who died on page one.

04:31.240 --> 04:36.060
And have that protagonist a very vital part of the entire story, rather than just a haunting

04:36.060 --> 04:36.540
memory.

04:37.440 --> 04:44.220
The only way to do that was of course to somehow keep him alive and one thing led to another.

04:44.460 --> 04:49.220
And the next thing I knew, Medeclura was a central computer on the Good Shit Night

04:49.220 --> 04:49.500
Flower.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.720
On our next show we'll talk more with Kevin O'Donnell Jr.

04:59.780 --> 05:04.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:04.560 --> 05:08.380
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.620
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:13.460 --> 06:18.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.040
And here are your hosts.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.500
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Anne.

06:29.800 --> 06:33.820
Bandersnatch, Science Fiction author Kevin O'Donnell Jr.'s first novel, made his paperback

06:33.820 --> 06:35.140
appearance in 1979.

06:36.240 --> 06:40.480
The first half of Bandersnatch depicts a 22nd century America deeply divided between the

06:40.480 --> 06:41.300
haves and the have-nots.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.060
A burgeoning bureaucracy strangles the have-nots.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.900
In five of O'Donnell's novels, the protagonist must contend with stultifying bureaucracies.

06:48.900 --> 06:52.980
When we ask O'Donnell if this represents a personal view, this is what he told us.

07:20.020 --> 07:24.980
It achieves a goal beyond its stated purpose, or it acquires a new goal.

07:25.860 --> 07:33.900
And that goal is to survive, to perpetuate itself, to expand, to get fat and strong and

07:33.900 --> 07:34.780
secure.

07:36.860 --> 07:41.620
It goes all the way back to Parkinson's Law, and the work expands until the time available

07:41.620 --> 07:43.420
and when it has, you hire two assistants.

07:46.020 --> 07:53.420
I think this is an inevitable trend in any bureaucracy, whether it's Western-style capitalism

07:53.940 --> 07:58.840
or Maoist communism.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.670
One of Mao's big campaigns was against bureaucracy.

08:02.640 --> 08:08.900
He was constantly railing against the way that no matter what he said, no matter what he did,

08:09.380 --> 08:11.100
the bureaucracy kept growing.

08:11.100 --> 08:18.440
It kept issuing new regulations and new rules, and here he was, the most powerful man in China,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.000
and he couldn't affect bureaucracy.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.920
So yeah, that's a very personal sort of point.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.040
A primitive planet is a setting for the second half of Bandersnatch.

08:28.220 --> 08:32.960
In a climactic struggle, the protagonist, also known as Bandersnatch, kills a monstrous,

08:33.080 --> 08:34.800
bear-like alien which has attacked him.

08:35.140 --> 08:39.220
Then he discovers the alien has a young cub which for some reason befriends him and becomes

08:39.220 --> 08:39.980
his sidekick.

08:39.980 --> 08:43.560
Well, Donald told us that the appearance and character of the cub were unplanned,

08:43.600 --> 08:44.620
had just sprang into being.

08:45.280 --> 08:49.900
A baby bear actually came about almost entirely by accident.

08:51.680 --> 08:58.540
I had had, you know, Bandersnatch wandering through this alien jungle.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.280
And I realized he needed like a...

09:05.280 --> 09:14.940
The way the story was going, he had to have this climactic battle sequence with a natural

09:14.940 --> 09:17.760
force, some sort of wild animal.

09:18.460 --> 09:24.320
And I hadn't had any wild animals, and they're really big enough for him.

09:27.340 --> 09:34.540
All of a sudden, off the page came this monstrous, bear-like animal that almost loomed up before him

09:34.540 --> 09:36.860
and started attacking him.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.340
And, well, he won.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.200
And there I was with a dead bear on the ground.

09:43.640 --> 09:49.680
And just sort of somehow my fingers kept going and there was a sound from the distance

09:49.680 --> 09:50.720
and it was the cub.

09:51.060 --> 09:55.120
And the next thing I knew, he had a sidekick as you put it.

09:55.860 --> 09:58.880
That was just accidental, really.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.420
Sidekicks are common in science fiction and fantasy.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.900
Here are Donald comments on the role of a sidekick.

10:05.460 --> 10:09.840
I think it helps when the protagonist has a sidekick of some sort.

10:13.140 --> 10:18.600
When you're writing science fiction, well, you know, why not give the hero an alien sidekick,

10:19.080 --> 10:20.660
Sam and the McGill fiend series?

10:22.360 --> 10:28.460
I think it lets you do a little exploring into alien psychology,

10:28.460 --> 10:37.760
and at the same time, it lets you keep making sort of mirror-like observations of human culture.

10:38.340 --> 10:40.460
More with Kevin O'Donnell Jr. on our next show.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.060
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:50.400 --> 10:52.980
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:52.980 --> 10:56.160
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.980
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:59.940 --> 12:05.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.440
And here are your hosts.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.820
This is Daryl Lane.

12:14.980 --> 12:15.560
And Bill Vernon.

12:16.020 --> 12:19.740
Kevin O'Donnell Jr. science fiction novel War of Omissions, published in 1982.

12:20.280 --> 12:25.120
In the book, O'Donnell describes a violent revolution which takes place in late 20th century America.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.060
This revolution begins in the northeast.

12:27.780 --> 12:31.660
O'Donnell presents the thoughts and actions of the participants on both sides of the revolution.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.320
We asked him what he was trying to get across in War of Omission.

12:35.480 --> 12:40.700
The modern-day recapitulation of the statements of power corrupt,

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
and absolute power corrupt, absolutely.

12:47.020 --> 12:54.180
I was trying to say, hey, it's real easy to say that the system stinks and we'll wipe it out.

12:54.180 --> 12:55.960
But what happens when you do wipe it out?

12:58.740 --> 13:06.420
You know, I think this is where every revolutionary since, you know, the French in 1787 is screwed up thoroughly.

13:07.100 --> 13:12.720
They say, well, you know, the present system is corrupt and it's bloated and it stinks and let's throw it out and we'll have paradise.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.600
I think that's stupid.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.400
I'm not a defender of the system.

13:18.400 --> 13:29.400
But I think the sort of sweeping, burn it down just doesn't work because, you know, you wind up building on rubble.

13:29.660 --> 13:34.060
You don't move into a structure that you can clean up and straighten out.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.000
You've got ashes.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.120
And I think really those two things were what the book was all about.

13:41.820 --> 13:47.120
The science-fictional element in War of Omission is the Tissere, a weapon the revolutionaries perfect

13:47.120 --> 13:50.340
which wipes out all objects in the target area instantaneously.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.120
It makes these objects disappear.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.380
Right, but it does something else as well.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.440
It wipes out the memory of the target area from everyone's minds.

13:58.120 --> 14:02.920
So if a person's house and family were deleted by a Tissere, neither he nor anyone else would have any memory of them.

14:03.100 --> 14:08.440
Most of the action, especially Tissere deletions, takes place in New Haven, the city where O'Donnell now lives.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.400
We asked O'Donnell if he enjoyed writing scenes in which New Haven gets destroyed.

14:12.780 --> 14:14.440
That generated an interesting sidelight.

14:14.440 --> 14:24.960
I was sort of offended by my publisher that they cut some references in there.

14:25.420 --> 14:26.860
We have a building here in town.

14:27.200 --> 14:33.880
It's the Knights of Columbus building and I think it's possibly the ugliest structure ever erected anywhere in America.

14:33.880 --> 14:46.920
It's a huge, towering, ugly brick building with massive turrets at each of the four corners of the building.

14:47.480 --> 14:54.780
It looks like it was designed to hold off an attack by mad and archers.

14:57.020 --> 15:00.060
I took great pleasure in destroying that in the book.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.560
Having it totally obliterated from the face of the earth.

15:04.060 --> 15:08.040
At one point I had a character bring it back and change his mind. It was so ugly.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.960
But the editor cut it right out.

15:12.460 --> 15:13.580
No, sorry, I can't do that.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.380
But it was fun taking out the rest in New Haven.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.940
The concept of the Tissere is the heart of War of Omission.

15:20.940 --> 15:24.300
Donal told us he put a lot of effort to make the Tissere believable.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.680
The hardest part was trying to make it plausible.

15:30.120 --> 15:37.080
A reviewer who has appeared that has really faulted the book on those grounds.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.320
For whatever reason that person did not believe the Tissere.

15:43.900 --> 15:48.620
I put so much effort into trying to make it believable.

15:48.620 --> 15:52.680
I think I put more effort into that than any other part of the book.

15:53.660 --> 15:55.440
Trying to make it seem very natural.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.340
And trying to provide possible explanations for why this happened.

16:00.540 --> 16:04.000
Sort of brief meditations on the nature of reality.

16:05.920 --> 16:13.700
For those who accepted the explanation, who believed the Tissere, I think the book worked.

16:13.700 --> 16:17.880
And I think if you can't believe that the book just falls flat.

16:18.620 --> 16:21.260
The Tissere is believable and War of Omission works.

16:21.740 --> 16:25.220
We'll look at Kevin O'Donnell Jr.'s Journeys of McGill Fee and Series on our next show.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:35.040 --> 16:37.620
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:37.620 --> 16:40.780
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:09.520 --> 17:13.680
Thank you for watching.

17:28.360 --> 17:32.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:48.260 --> 17:53.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:56.470 --> 17:57.720
And here are your hosts.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.160
This is Bill Vernon.

18:03.360 --> 18:03.940
And Daryl Lane.

18:04.160 --> 18:08.520
Science Fiction author Kevin O'Donnell Jr. has written many short stories plus six novels today.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.400
Three of his novels form a series.

18:10.400 --> 18:16.840
The series is called The Journeys of McGill Fee and the three installments are subtitled Caverns, Reefs and Lava.

18:17.180 --> 18:23.660
McGill Fee is a 21st century earthling who at age four days is swallowed by a mysterious, giant, amoebillite gastropod,

18:24.300 --> 18:27.920
which was sent by the even more mysterious far being Rhett's Glorin.

18:28.540 --> 18:32.900
The infant McGill remains in the gastropod precisely 71 hours and 24 minutes.

18:33.340 --> 18:36.540
Then he is discharged and the gastropod leaves the earth with no comment.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.620
McGill seems to be a normal lad.

18:38.620 --> 18:45.720
At age five, however, it is discovered that he has the flinger talent, the extremely rare ability to transmit people or objects

18:45.720 --> 18:52.520
instantaneously to distant destinations in the galaxy, providing the total mass of any load doesn't exceed 918 kilograms.

18:53.060 --> 18:58.240
Young McGill is enrolled in the Flinger Academy where he masters the art under the tutelage of experienced flingers.

18:58.540 --> 19:01.040
Then at age 17 he is certified as a flinger.

19:01.320 --> 19:06.420
But since McGill has puzzled about the motive of the far being for having the gastropod swallow him for three days,

19:06.420 --> 19:09.360
he vows to seek out the far being and ask him why.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.560
Another group is interested in McGill too, the organization.

19:13.140 --> 19:17.040
They reason that if the far being has something in store for McGill, then they want it too.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.180
The stage is set.

19:18.520 --> 19:23.260
Young McGill is mastering flinging while simultaneously learning about such things in life as romance,

19:23.780 --> 19:27.080
trying to live with the flinger bureaucracy and searching for the far being.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.040
All the while the sinister organization is after him.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.220
The series is obviously humorous, but it's serious as well.

19:33.220 --> 19:35.860
Hero Donald comments on his intention for the series.

19:36.500 --> 19:48.200
Well, my primary intent in the McGill fan series is to do something in life, fast-paced, adventuresome,

19:49.220 --> 19:59.100
that nonetheless shows a person of incredible talent growing up and the problems he faces.

20:02.740 --> 20:10.500
That aspect of attempts to take lower priority and the adventures of McGill being come first.

20:11.280 --> 20:17.360
I do want a book that people can sit down and read quickly and really enjoy.

20:17.880 --> 20:21.100
It's not a gloomy book.

20:21.920 --> 20:26.160
The Andrew Snatch and War of Omission are sort of downbeat books.

20:27.060 --> 20:34.080
Nape Lines is in a way upbeat, but it's got a lot of depressing stuff in it.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.440
Whereas McGill's fan is not.

20:38.860 --> 20:45.940
I do it partly to change the pace, to write a book that just moves right along with the art of finish.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.500
There's a lot of things happening.

20:49.580 --> 20:55.620
He has a very clear-cut hero who isn't unless human, has his problems.

20:56.540 --> 21:02.420
In the first book, Caverns, McGill takes charge of a ron-gon egg which hatches in book two, Reefs.

21:02.760 --> 21:07.400
He names the young reptilian ron-gon Sam, and Sam becomes McGill's sidekick.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.640
Hero Donald comments on Sam's role.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.020
Of course Sam, he's going to grow up so mixed up.

21:13.920 --> 21:19.220
Because he's being raised entirely on earth, well except for their excursions off-world.

21:19.360 --> 21:24.680
But he's being raised by a human being with very human values. But Sam is not human.

21:25.640 --> 21:35.100
When he gets to his tips to maturity, he's going to be, oh heavens, from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, he's going to be about 15 feet long.

21:36.100 --> 21:39.940
And he can stand about, oh, what, four and a half feet high at the shoulder?

21:41.180 --> 21:47.220
There's the back part of him, and his head will be pretty much about six feet off the ground.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.180
I mean, he's going to be big. He's going to be very alien-looking.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.860
And he's going to have a lot of trouble because he's neither one nor the other.

21:57.640 --> 22:02.540
He's not a ron-gon. He knows nothing of ron-gon culture.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.140
But he's not, and can never be a human being.

22:09.840 --> 22:13.080
I see lots of interesting problems ahead for Sam.

22:13.820 --> 22:17.140
More on Kevin O'Donnell Jr.'s The Journeys of McGill Fee and Next Time.

22:23.500 --> 22:32.600
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.120
Thanks for watching!

23:20.020 --> 23:23.960
Coming up next is The Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us!

23:47.900 --> 23:49.340
And here are your hosts.

23:53.660 --> 23:54.760
This is Daryl Lane.

23:54.860 --> 23:55.460
And Bill Vernon.

23:55.860 --> 24:02.380
Kevin O'Donnell Jr.'s Science Fiction Series, The Journeys of McGill Fee and His Highly Popular Adventure Yarn, Featuring the Young Flinger McGill Fee and,

24:02.600 --> 24:05.360
Who, after having developed his talent, is searching for the far-being.

24:05.740 --> 24:11.340
Not only must young Fee and Cope with his talent and life in general, he must avoid being captured by the organization.

24:11.340 --> 24:19.900
The series is humorous, but interspersed among the action and humor are the violent deaths of many of McGill's allies and friends, including his parents, his lovers, and his roommates.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.020
We asked O'Donnell why he so freely dispatches with most of McGill's acquaintances.

24:24.940 --> 24:27.980
Part of that is cold calculation on my part.

24:28.700 --> 24:37.700
That when you're writing a series, one of the real difficulties is convincing the reader that your hero is in danger.

24:38.180 --> 24:42.120
When you write one book, there's no problem, because the reader doesn't know how it's going to come out.

24:42.400 --> 24:51.600
But when you have a series, the reader says, well, hey, look, you know, he's been through 18 of these adventures now, and he's emerged on the gauge from everyone, so why worry?

24:52.120 --> 24:55.440
And, you know, the reader's emotional involvement in the story is lessened.

24:55.680 --> 25:06.580
But when it is a real danger, when people near and dear to them are dying, and in some cases dying horribly, it brings the threat much closer,

25:06.580 --> 25:07.680
and it makes it much more plausible.

25:09.820 --> 25:14.040
And at this point, McGill has lost a lot of people who are very close to him.

25:14.920 --> 25:19.480
His parents, Nadia, and Braestine, he's going to lose more.

25:21.280 --> 25:30.760
You know, as I say, part of it is cold calculation, but part of it is also realistic appraisal of the situation being him.

25:30.760 --> 25:41.660
He's got this talent, he's got this mysterious link with this even more mysterious alien being, and he has people hot on his trail.

25:44.260 --> 25:54.760
And it brings, you know, reader's credibility to have not only him, but all his friends coming to you safe and sound every time.

25:54.760 --> 26:03.020
You know, the organization, they may not be perfect, but they're not total amateurs, and they're going to be striking real close to home.

26:04.900 --> 26:09.400
And they have so far in the first three books, and they'll continue to.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.020
McGill encounters several types of aliens on his journeys.

26:13.460 --> 26:16.960
We ask O'Donnell for what purpose does he use alien characters in the series?

26:16.960 --> 26:22.740
In the series, I'm trying to make aliens who are comprehensible.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.180
And yet who are not human.

26:28.040 --> 26:37.020
I really think when we run into alien species, and sooner or later we will, they will have traits which we recognize as traits that we have.

26:38.620 --> 26:43.860
In lava, I've got these religious fanatics running around.

26:45.880 --> 26:57.640
I suspect that any sentient race we encounter will, at least in one stage of their development, have gone through an intensely religious period.

26:57.640 --> 27:10.280
But like still be religious today, if you can tell, but I think any sentient being has to wonder on its origin, how it came to be, why it came to be, who created the universe.

27:12.000 --> 27:27.660
So, you know, I'm trying to, not to mirror humanity, but to suggest that there are alternates with which we can have traits, attitudes in Donnell.

27:28.380 --> 27:34.760
So far, O'Donnell has written three books in the McGill-Phean series. Here's what O'Donnell said when we asked him if there would be any more in the series.

27:34.760 --> 27:46.600
Yes, definitely. At the moment is a McGill story, and from his childhood just been published in Berkeley Showcase.

27:48.480 --> 27:53.900
There will be more being books.

27:53.900 --> 28:03.620
At the moment, I'm saying seven more in the series will end soon. I'm glad to at least attend.

28:04.540 --> 28:09.800
Kevin O'Donnell Jr. will keep us entertained with the adventures of McGill-Phean for at least a while longer.

28:16.480 --> 28:25.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:50.960 --> 28:51.500
Thank you.
