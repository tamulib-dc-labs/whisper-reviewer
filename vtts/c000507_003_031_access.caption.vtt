00:01.500 --> 00:02.860
I'm like I reiterated things.

00:03.100 --> 00:05.040
Tell him anything about it.

00:05.860 --> 00:07.520
Transition to Scott Baum.

00:11.340 --> 00:16.460
We also had the opportunity to talk to another acquaintance of Robert E. Howard, Mr. Scott Baum.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.640
Nothing about Adam, his brother?

00:25.980 --> 00:28.260
Let me get things cranked up here.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.280
What are you going to ask me?

00:28.580 --> 00:43.720
That makes no difference. So... Okay. Basically,
well, how long have you been living in Cross Plains? I've been living in Cross

00:43.720 --> 00:58.660
Plains... I've lived here since 1922. That'll be about, good Lord, that's a
while isn't it. Yeah. I was a boy here and went to college and came back, took

00:58.660 --> 01:06.820
over the newspaper, got out of college one day and took over the newspaper for
the next, and been here all the while. I retired from the newspaper about eight

01:06.820 --> 01:20.380
or nine years ago. When did you first meet Mr. Howard? When did I first meet
him? Well, as a boy, I knew him here when he was a boy. Howard's about four or

01:20.380 --> 01:33.580
five years older than I am, four years, I guess. I guess he would be about, I'm
70 years old. Howard must be 74, 75 now, I think. OK. I could check that out

01:33.580 --> 01:41.120
for you, but possibly you got that information at hand. Yes. When did you...? I
knew him at...

01:43.500 --> 01:57.900
I started high school. Let's see. I came in here, moved here from a nearby
town and entered high school as about a sophomore. In those days, we only had 10

01:57.900 --> 02:07.020
grades here, and they were not affiliated, and Howard went down to Brownwood to
finish his high school work in order to be qualified, you know, to enter

02:07.020 --> 02:08.520
college. Yeah.

02:11.300 --> 02:23.220
When you came back to Cross Plains, after going to college and you started over
the newspaperâ€” That was in July, I took over the newspaper in July, 1930. Howard

02:23.220 --> 02:36.640
was here at the time. He was a young man some, I was 20 years old. Now Howard
must have been 24 or 5. He was writing for a bunch of pulp magazines, Just

02:36.640 --> 02:47.920
Getting Started. And very few people remember the names of those magazines, but
it was Storm Street and Smith. They published a number of magazines like Weird

02:47.920 --> 02:48.600
Tales.

02:51.000 --> 03:03.020
Weird Tales was one of them, I believe. And boxing and Wild West and a whole lot
of stuff like that. He mainly wrote for Weird Tales but he also occasionally

03:03.020 --> 03:12.660
wrote for... Is it in Ring or something? He occasionally wrote for a boxing
magazine too. Yeah, we were talking to Miss Laughlin, and she said sometimes he

03:12.660 --> 03:23.440
would go down the streets there shadowboxing and sort of doing a little... Yeah.
I imagine that's more or less exaggerated. He, Howard was was a little on the a

03:23.440 --> 03:32.320
little, uh, little, little on the odd side. He wasn't intimate with very many
people. They was rather aloof, but he was a big, robust man to me. He was a

03:32.320 --> 03:41.960
combination of, uh, Edgar Allen Poe and Jack London. If you could put the, you
can imagine that two together. Yeah, he had those books in his library. So I can

03:41.960 --> 03:54.100
imagine that pretty well. Uh, he was virile, robust, like, uh, Jack London. he
was a like Poe

03:54.720 --> 04:07.260
he wrote a few poems maybe you're familiar with the one called The Temptress The
Tempter he wrote a very good it reminds you of Poe's Raven something the meter

04:07.260 --> 04:20.780
of it is something like that he compares the tempter as a beautiful maiden who
lures him Her name is Suicide. Yeah, I do believe I have read that one. Yeah,

04:20.840 --> 04:30.900
I'm sure you've read it. Were very many people in cross-plains aware that Howard
was a writer? Oh, they all knew it. I published in the newspaper, you know,

04:31.000 --> 04:41.360
every once in a while. I'd say Robert Howard had a story this week, and Weird
Tales, or some other, those pub magazines. Yeah, they knew it. Yeah, yeah. I

04:41.360 --> 04:49.500
take it, being a small town, I guess just about everybody knew everything else.
Oh yeah, that's right. and his daddy was a doctor here country doctor general

04:49.500 --> 04:55.460
practitioner well thought off very popular and

04:55.460 --> 05:04.380
his father was proud of the fact that his son was a gifted writer he talked
about it yeah

05:08.200 --> 05:15.980
well let's see I'm about run through my gambit of questions here was there Is
there anything... any particular stories you know about Mr. Howard, being that

05:15.980 --> 05:33.720
you were a newspaper man and everything? He might have had some exploits out
there. I remember the morning he killed himself very well. It was a... I can't

05:33.720 --> 05:45.540
think just what it was. I know it's a warm season in the year. It must have been
summer. But anyway, early, sometimes 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning, I heard on

05:45.540 --> 05:54.960
the street that Robert Howard had just shot himself. But I immediately jumped in
my car and ran down there and got down there, and a few neighbors had gathered.

05:55.720 --> 06:06.920
It wasn't generally known over town, but the old justice of the peace was
standing there on the gallery, the front porch. And when I walked up, he called

06:06.920 --> 06:16.480
me and said, Come here, Jack. And I stepped up there and he took me into the
bedroom and he pointed to an old Underwood typewriter and it had four lines

06:16.480 --> 06:28.980
written on it there. And Howard had, when he had been told that his mother
wouldn't live throughout the day, he went to this typewriter, wrote these four

06:28.980 --> 06:40.020
lines and walked outside and sat down in his car and shot his head off. And this
old GP asked me what these four lines meant. I'm sure you've read them all flat,

06:40.200 --> 06:44.480
all done. So let me on the tire. The feast is over, the lamps expire.

06:47.200 --> 06:58.980
Yeah, we had read it. That's it. I'm sure you've read that. To me, I've been
told since then by Sprague de Kemp that the lines are not entirely original. But

06:58.980 --> 07:09.080
they were certainly original as far as I'd ever heard or anybody else I've ever
talked to except Sprague de Camp. Yeah, I imagine that was Howard's way of

07:09.080 --> 07:14.540
putting it. Yeah, that was his valedictory, his finale.

07:17.240 --> 07:24.560
Well, Mr. Scott, I can't think of anything else. Can you think of any other old
things? I'll tell you, you've got a fellow there in Odessa. I'll tell you, a

07:24.560 --> 07:27.720
young man there in Odessa, you can pick up on the telephone and call him and
knew him.

07:47.320 --> 07:58.540
...onward Howard. Have you talked to CS-4? Uh, no sir, we talked to Jack Scott.
Yeah, I know Jack. They're in crossplanes, and he referred us to you and your

07:58.540 --> 08:10.520
brother. Mm-hmm. And, uh, what we were mainly just looking for are just some,
uh, oh, some interesting stories or any reminisces you might have about Mr.

08:10.560 --> 08:20.480
Howard. Well, yes, I'd be glad to tell you what I know about him. I'll try to
think of some of the things that happened. He was, uh,

08:23.840 --> 08:33.400
an unusual fella. I know that. And, uh, have you read some of his stories? Yes,
I have. What type of person was he? Well, he was a kind of a loner.

08:36.420 --> 08:48.600
And uh... I'll just recount one incident. I don't think he ever went with a girl
at all. But he wrote some pretty outstanding stories.

08:53.800 --> 09:09.700
Well, as I'm saying, And I recall some of the stories he wrote when he was in
high school, and they were really outstanding, but he never did. He really

09:09.700 --> 09:22.560
wasn't in our group. He was kind of an outsider, yet he was readily accepted.
But I remember one time we were having a party, and I was running a little old

09:22.560 --> 09:36.940
rental store there in Cross Planes, and we were having a party upstairs and
Robert came and we were drinking some beer, chalk beer or something. That was

09:36.940 --> 09:38.860
way back before Prohibition, you know.

09:41.900 --> 09:55.480
And I know he got very upset about that he got a little bit tied in and he said
that he would kill anybody that interfered with his hands. if his hands ever got

09:55.480 --> 09:59.800
damaged by somebody else that he'd kill them.

10:03.220 --> 10:12.780
Hello. Yes, sir. And that was just kind of the kind of fellow he was, kind of
morose, and he

10:12.780 --> 10:17.160
thought he had a real bright future in the head of him. He's a writer. Yeah.

10:19.980 --> 10:30.840
And I don't think I ever saw him after that until I heard he had, I believe he
committed suicide, didn't he? Yes, sir, he did. In 1936. I knew his father real

10:30.840 --> 10:34.740
well. I didn't know his mother much. I know he was an only child, I believe.

10:40.180 --> 10:53.680
And he never did enter into any of our activities very much as I remember, so I
don't really know what I could say to you that would help young men. Well, what

10:53.680 --> 11:00.460
you've already told us is quite a bit of help. Why do you suppose he was such a
loner, being in from such a small town and usually everybody you know, does

11:00.460 --> 11:13.180
things so much together in a small town. I don't know. I don't know. He just, he
could've been a great author, I think. He had a, I don't remember even what kind

11:13.180 --> 11:28.460
of grades he made academically. I know I uh... took an idea he had for a story
and tried to write a theme on it and he had already turned the theme in and I

11:28.460 --> 11:40.900
got in big trouble there as you know of trying to steal his idea. And... that
kinda... I never did try that anymore again. But I know he could tell a story

11:40.900 --> 11:55.280
that But really, this was something about a bear... ...who got up in the attic
or something and broke through... ...and disturbed some poker players. But then,

11:55.420 --> 12:06.100
I really can't tell you very much about Robert. Come to think of it, there's
another rider, C.S. Boyd, I don't know whether you ever heard of him or not. Uh,

12:06.480 --> 12:20.220
no sir. In our town. Jack Scott didn't mention C.S. No, I don't believe so, no.
What did Jack tell you about him? Mostly he had worked a little bit for Jack on

12:20.220 --> 12:33.780
the newspaper and Jack talked about what type of person he was, a vigorous man
although he kept to himself quite a bit. I wish I could recall more about that

12:33.780 --> 12:45.200
party but I know he scared the hell out of all of us because he got real excited
and thought he was trying to damage his writing career or something by getting

12:45.200 --> 12:58.400
him full of beer. I don't recall exactly what, but anyway, he said he'd kill
anybody that damaged

12:58.400 --> 13:09.860
his hands in any way. I seem like I remember that pretty vividly. I don't know.
Maybe something happened there with his hands. Maybe we got in a wrass in the

13:09.860 --> 13:15.920
match or something, I don't know. But anyway, he wanted to write with his hands.

13:20.860 --> 13:28.020
That's very interesting. You don't happen to write like any other things that
you might have done with Howard back when y'all are living in Crossroads? Well,

13:28.080 --> 13:41.100
like I say, he wasn't in our group. We went fishing and we went swimming in the
mare over there and we hunted quail, but he was never one of us. And how he

13:41.100 --> 13:57.300
happened to be in this deal, I don't know. I don't think he ever had a date with
a girl. He was a nice looking guy. Very presentable and tall and well made. and

13:57.300 --> 14:07.740
even if I talk to you, I can't really tell you anything much that I remember
about him except that I remember him being a very outstanding, that he would

14:07.740 --> 14:17.340
have been a great writer, I think. Listen, what you've told me so far has been
quite helpful. We're putting together just bits and pieces of people who did

14:17.340 --> 14:29.040
know him along with some research that some other people have done. Uh-huh. And
I'd like to go ahead and put your recollections of that party and some of the

14:29.040 --> 14:30.440
other things you said into our program.

14:33.020 --> 14:45.940
Well, that's authentic, but I can't quite recall the details of what happened to
his hands. Maybe we were arm wrestling or something, I don't know. but he got

14:45.940 --> 14:59.300
very uptight about what might happen to one of his hands or his arms or
something. I guess that was the only time he ever had a drink of beer in his

14:59.300 --> 15:09.480
life. It sounded like what we were talking with some of the other people that he
might've been kind of insecure. Well, I think so. He was an only child, I know

15:09.480 --> 15:19.660
that. I don't know how close he was with his mother but I don't think his father
had anything to do with him. It was my kind of feeling, I don't know.

15:23.120 --> 15:36.420
Dr. Howard was a real fine man, though, and I don't know how close they were
together, but I think that he worshipped his mother was my impression in those

15:36.420 --> 15:50.700
years. And I don't know whether she died first or not, do you? Aye. She had gone
into a coma and was not expected to recover. Oh, well, now that's the reason for

15:50.700 --> 16:08.140
the suicide. Yes. Because he worshipped her. I know I can almost be sure of
that, that he worshipped his mother. Okay. And I know that her condition affects

16:08.140 --> 16:22.320
him very much. And I know that he was real afraid that something would happen
that he couldn't ride anymore. Whether it was mine or whether it was in his mind

16:22.320 --> 16:32.120
or whether it was in his fear that something would happen to his hands. But
that's it, I recall, more vividly than anything else, and I've often thought of

16:32.120 --> 16:45.800
it. I certainly do appreciate your talking with me. And I believe I was the one
that I believe that he could have strangled me to death there. I don't recall

16:45.800 --> 16:52.000
whether it was me or somebody else, but it seemed to me like his anger was
toward me.

16:55.800 --> 17:07.980
But I know he frightened the hell out of me. He was a very big and strong
fellow. Yes, very strong because uh, could have twisted your neck off Much like

17:07.980 --> 17:10.520
the heroes that he wrote about Mhm

17:14.100 --> 17:21.460
Alright, if you would, if you give me your address I'll send you a release form
and what that does is simply you give us permission to use what I've been taping

17:21.460 --> 17:31.280
Oh, well that doesn't matter to me, I don't care whether you use or not I'm just
trying to be honest with you Yeah I have no hold on it. You can quote me any way

17:31.280 --> 17:41.380
you want to. As I say, it's been a long time ago, but those are my
recollections, and I've often thought of them. You made a real strong impression

17:41.380 --> 17:53.440
on me that I was in real danger there. Well, fortunately, you made it through
it. Well, other things have happened to me that I guess are almost as dangerous,

17:53.440 --> 18:10.960
But then, anyway, that's what I remember about Robert. He drew all that with no
problems, apparently, and no attachments

18:10.960 --> 18:13.200
that I know of to anybody except...
