Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.960 --> 00:35.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:35.960 --> 00:42.560
And here are your hosts.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.640
This is Bill Vernon.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.640
And Darryl Lenn.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.280
Science Fiction writer George R.R. Martin recently had his third novel, Fever Dream, published

00:49.280 --> 00:51.680
in Hardcover by Poseidon Press.

00:51.680 --> 00:55.920
Fever Dream is a science fictional historical horror novel, which combines the vampire legend

00:55.920 --> 00:58.120
and Mississippi River boats in the antebellum south.

00:58.120 --> 01:02.120
Yes, Martin, why chose to write about a combination of vampires and river boats.

01:02.120 --> 01:05.120
The vampires came first as I was putting the book together.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.360
I had read a firm out about vampires.

01:08.360 --> 01:12.600
I had read other people's vampire novels, of course, Dracula, and the other books, too,

01:12.600 --> 01:13.600
recently.

01:13.600 --> 01:19.120
And I had wanted to do my own version of that legend for some time, because I had a few

01:19.120 --> 01:20.760
ideas about it.

01:20.760 --> 01:26.440
But I didn't want it to be just another Dracula book, just another rehash of the same old

01:26.440 --> 01:27.440
legend.

01:27.440 --> 01:32.440
As we've seen vampire books and the vampire books, they're essentially just the same thing

01:32.440 --> 01:33.840
spun over and over again.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.360
I think that's what tires them.

01:36.360 --> 01:40.200
And at the same time, I was going through all these thoughts about vampires, was the period

01:40.200 --> 01:42.960
that I was living in the Bugaiowa.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.840
I taught college there for three years.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.760
And the bugle, of course, is an old river town.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.400
It was once a big steamboat manufacturing center, and it's still very much a bug with

01:52.400 --> 01:57.720
the history of the great era of steam on the Mississippi.

01:57.720 --> 02:04.240
So it was during that period, while I was in the built that I got interested in the

02:04.240 --> 02:07.080
that period of history I got interested in the steamboat.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.840
I read a fair amount about them.

02:08.840 --> 02:13.640
And once I did, the two things just seemed to come together in my mind.

02:13.640 --> 02:21.080
There's a certain romanticism, I think, a dark romanticism that clings to both the

02:21.080 --> 02:23.120
old steamboats and vampires.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.320
They're both very attractive in a certain sense.

02:26.320 --> 02:33.440
The elegant vampire and the stately, intricate, gorgeous steamboat.

02:33.440 --> 02:45.800
But they also have dark sides too, first.

02:45.800 --> 02:50.280
In fever dreams, the protagonist, Captain Abner Marsh, owner of a failing steamboat company,

02:50.280 --> 02:55.760
the fever river packet line, realizes his lifelong dream of captaining a fast, luxurious steamboat

02:55.760 --> 02:58.760
when it becomes partners with the mysterious Joshua York.

02:58.760 --> 03:02.440
All Marsh has to do to maintain the partnership and keep the fancy steamboat.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.920
It's sail up and down the river and avoid questioning York's somewhat odd habits.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.720
But York begins bringing a board of strange retinue of acquaintances, all of whom have

03:10.720 --> 03:11.720
nocturnal habits.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.640
And of course, Marsh has difficulty staying his curiosity.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.440
As Marsh learns about York and his friends, he discovers they are vampires.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.720
Martin presents vampires in a manner never seen in fantasy.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.240
He explains them in rational terms.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.560
This meant including some of the legendary characteristics of vampires, but leaving

03:27.560 --> 03:28.560
others out.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.640
I wanted to have rationalized vampires.

03:31.640 --> 03:40.720
I wanted to have vampires that I thought could actually exist that were not based on

03:40.720 --> 03:43.480
vague supernatural legends in the down over the years.

03:43.480 --> 03:47.480
So I had to look at each of the particular beliefs associated with vampires.

03:47.480 --> 03:53.040
Now, see, is there any way that I could justify this in a rational manner?

03:53.040 --> 03:58.000
Now, obviously, something about vampires not coming out during day, which the vampires

03:58.000 --> 04:01.360
in my book, Fever Dream, do have that characteristic.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.720
Well, that's very easily explainable.

04:03.720 --> 04:08.800
It's just they're not turnal creatures.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.960
Their skin is extremely sensitive to ultraviolet, so they burn very badly.

04:12.960 --> 04:19.160
If they're exposed to daylight, so they avoid it.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.960
You can justify that easily.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.200
But you look at something that not reflected in mirrors.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.800
I mean, there's no way to justify not being respected mirrors scientifically.

04:27.800 --> 04:33.040
You have to rewrite essentially all the laws governing light and reflection and

04:33.040 --> 04:34.640
refractions, so on.

04:34.640 --> 04:38.240
That's strictly a supermatch on motif, so I had to get rid of that.

04:38.240 --> 04:42.160
Obviously, considering that the book is about vampires on the specific

04:42.160 --> 04:46.960
steamboats, I had to get rid of the one that said they can't cross running water as

04:46.960 --> 04:47.960
well.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.240
I'd say I'll up and down the steamboat all through the book.

04:51.240 --> 05:01.120
More on George Martin's Fever Dream on our next show.

05:01.120 --> 05:05.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:05.000 --> 05:09.520
Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:42.160 --> 06:02.160
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:02.160 --> 06:23.160
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:23.160 --> 06:28.800
And here are your hosts.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.880
This is Darryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

06:30.880 --> 06:34.820
Science Fiction writer George R.R. Martin's latest novel, Fever Dream, a science fictional

06:34.820 --> 06:39.320
historical horror effort, was recently published in Hardcover by Poseidon Press and distributed

06:39.320 --> 06:40.640
by Simon & Schuster.

06:40.640 --> 06:44.400
As we discussed in our last show, the book combines elements of the vampire legend and

06:44.400 --> 06:48.360
a marked twang-like presentation of Mississippi Riverboat lore.

06:48.360 --> 06:52.960
Joshua York, the partner of Captain Abner Marsh, is a vampire who has managed to concoct

06:52.960 --> 06:55.720
a potion which will alleviate the red thirst.

06:55.720 --> 06:59.280
The scourge which visits the vampires in Martin's novel periodically and drives him into

06:59.280 --> 07:03.960
an uncontrollable state of bloodlust, which can only be satiated by human blood.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.320
Preferably that from young, attractive, living humans.

07:06.320 --> 07:11.360
The humans, by the way, are deprecatingly referred to by some of the vampires as cattle.

07:11.360 --> 07:15.760
The existence of the potion is the key to Martin's novel, that gives the vampires a choice.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.520
They can continue feasting on the blood of the cattle, or they can finally quit terrorizing

07:19.520 --> 07:21.920
the human race and drink only the artificial brew.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.680
This choice is another element which separates Martin's vampires from those of traditional

07:25.680 --> 07:26.680
fantasy.

07:26.760 --> 07:31.200
I suppose as much as anything else, I mean the book is about vampires and Mississippi

07:31.200 --> 07:36.040
River Steamboats, but in a deeper sense, it's about moral choices.

07:36.040 --> 07:42.680
And one of the things that Joshua York, the vampire, says to Abner, Abner Marsh, protagonist

07:42.680 --> 07:47.040
and the abner later says back to him is, you make your choices.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.320
We all make our choices.

07:49.320 --> 07:54.280
If you take the traditional vampire thing, the traditional vampire leaves the traditional

07:54.280 --> 07:56.280
position of the vampire.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.480
You don't have choice.

07:59.480 --> 08:06.760
The vampire is an avatar of undying, ancient and absolutely black evil.

08:06.760 --> 08:16.000
Well, okay, fine, that makes her good entertainment, but as it interacts with the real world,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.200
kind of a hollow construct.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.200
The real world is made up of grades.

08:20.200 --> 08:26.200
We don't have absolute goods, and we don't have absolute evil.

08:26.200 --> 08:31.680
It's a good evil that we have, you know, resides in each of us, and it is a matter of moral

08:31.680 --> 08:32.680
choice.

08:32.680 --> 08:37.160
Damon Julian is a charismatic elder vampire who rejects the potion.

08:37.160 --> 08:40.800
He did make a choice, he wants to go, but he also makes the choice in terms of the book

08:40.800 --> 08:48.640
at the banquet when he essentially rejects what Joshua has to offer.

08:48.640 --> 08:55.080
And he states his opposition to Joshua with saying, you know, we are born, this is what

08:55.080 --> 08:58.560
we are born to be.

08:58.560 --> 09:05.640
Masters over humanity, people who take the lives of those inferior to us.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.040
And this is our nature.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.360
So he is making a choice there.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.760
He's rejecting Joshua's potion, he's rejecting the freedom from the red thirst that Joshua

09:14.760 --> 09:18.600
offers, and he's accepting what he thinks is.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.240
He's a purier nature.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.240
Martin told us that he found a close parallel between Julian's view of the human race,

09:26.240 --> 09:30.240
and slavery as it existed in the South at the time of the book, 1857.

09:30.240 --> 09:36.440
Of course there's also certain, you know, resonance is there with the whole slavery effect,

09:36.440 --> 09:39.520
which I tried to put through all the way through the book.

09:39.520 --> 09:47.880
It takes place in the antebellum South, late antebellum South, and slavery is for some

09:47.880 --> 09:54.200
other hot sand, and the whole master slave thing that existed between black and white and

09:54.200 --> 10:02.120
the South then, has a kind of fantasy, a flexure than relations between vampires and human beings.

10:02.120 --> 10:06.240
This parallel even strikes Abner Marsh as a story progresses.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.040
Abner Marsh is never an evil man.

10:09.040 --> 10:13.720
I think by nature he is a good man, but he is a man at the beginning of the book who's

10:13.720 --> 10:16.440
essentially just living his own life.

10:16.440 --> 10:23.560
And the great moral issues of his time, like slavery, are things he kind of hashes out

10:23.560 --> 10:31.520
over the dinner table, but never has any great personal involvement in.

10:31.520 --> 10:36.360
But as a result of the whole experience with the steamer fever dream, and the things

10:36.360 --> 10:40.960
happen to him, I think Marsh changes and becomes an essence man is much more aware of

10:40.960 --> 10:43.920
the necessity to make moral choices.

10:43.920 --> 10:53.840
We're on George Martin's fever dream on our next show.

10:53.840 --> 10:57.680
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

10:57.680 --> 11:05.200
Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:35.200 --> 11:51.360
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:05.200 --> 12:15.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:15.720 --> 12:21.440
And here are your hosts.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.480
This is Bill Vernon, and Darryl Lane.

12:23.480 --> 12:27.760
Science Fiction author George R.R. Martin's latest novelist fever dream, a science fictional

12:27.760 --> 12:31.640
historical horror story about vampires and Mississippi riverboats.

12:31.640 --> 12:56.920
Darryl Martin explains the title of the book.

12:56.920 --> 13:01.640
Okay that explains the origin of fever dream, but where did the oddly spelled fever originate?

13:01.640 --> 13:05.400
It has to do with Captain Marsh's birthplace.

13:05.400 --> 13:11.280
He was born in Galina, Illinois.

13:11.280 --> 13:17.040
And the river, Galina is located on a small tributary that comes off Mississippi, which originally

13:17.040 --> 13:24.080
was named the fever river, F-E-V-R-E river, in the early 1800s.

13:24.080 --> 13:29.200
And Marsh, of course, was born during that period and grew up calling it.

13:29.200 --> 13:35.680
In point of fact, and this is all historically true, the name of that river was changed

13:35.680 --> 13:41.560
to the Galina river fairly early on, because the town got respectable and they didn't want

13:41.560 --> 13:43.560
people thinking they were all sick there.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.440
But I thought there would be better to call it the Galina river.

13:46.440 --> 13:51.000
But Galina was a very important steveboat town, and the fever in its early days, today

13:51.000 --> 13:55.840
it's nothing but a creek, it's completely silted off and I've visited it and you can get

13:55.840 --> 13:59.560
a railroad, a habit, let alone a major steamer.

13:59.560 --> 14:07.160
But in the early 1800s, Galina was a major steveboat port, and the fever or the Galina river

14:07.160 --> 14:12.480
as it later became was a very bustling little tributary indeed.

14:12.480 --> 14:17.160
We asked Martin if there were actual steveboats as fast and as luxurious as the fever dream.

14:17.160 --> 14:22.760
The dimensions of the fever dream and the capacity of our engines and so forth are modeled

14:22.760 --> 14:25.800
very closely on the equips.

14:25.800 --> 14:31.200
In terms of the brook, the equips is the queen of the river, the fastest, largest, most luxurious

14:31.200 --> 14:37.760
boat, and it's the one Abner Marsh aspires to this place as fast as steamer on the river

14:37.760 --> 14:40.000
and that's why it builds the fever dream.

14:40.000 --> 14:50.080
The equips was a real historical boat of its era, the 1850s, and was considered the fastest

14:50.080 --> 14:51.080
boat of that era.

14:51.080 --> 14:58.280
It did indeed win a very famous steveboat race against the shot well.

14:58.280 --> 15:03.600
Some people, including Mark Twain, put forward evidence that the fever dream was in fact

15:03.600 --> 15:06.800
the fastest steamer ever on the river.

15:06.800 --> 15:12.880
The new related steamer is in the 1870s and the 1880s, that while they were not perhaps

15:12.880 --> 15:21.800
as fast as the fever dream and the brook or the equips in real life were even more luxurious

15:21.800 --> 15:30.960
like the J.M. White, very fast and incredibly luxurious steamer of the 1870s, 1880s.

15:30.960 --> 15:34.120
One of the interesting facts that strikes the readers, their riverboats, were extremely

15:34.120 --> 15:35.120
short-lived.

15:35.920 --> 15:41.560
That was one of the interesting things that turned up when I was researching at that kind

15:41.560 --> 15:42.560
of startle me too.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.200
I mean, there's such formidable looking structures.

15:45.200 --> 15:56.440
You'd think they'd be around for ages, but in fact, they had a shorter lifespan than the

15:56.440 --> 15:58.840
modern car.

15:58.840 --> 16:03.200
Martin headed to considerable research on steamboats to ensure the accuracy of historical details

16:03.200 --> 16:04.200
in fever dream.

16:04.760 --> 16:08.240
It took me two years to do fever dream altogether.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.280
The first year of that was largely research.

16:10.280 --> 16:13.480
So a lot of research did go into it.

16:13.480 --> 16:20.120
I think that's an necessity if you're going to adjust it to any sort of historical fiction.

16:20.120 --> 16:25.280
Peaver dream, of course, is historical horror, but I still thank you to all your readers

16:25.280 --> 16:31.280
that get them acturously in so far as a capable woman.

16:31.280 --> 16:40.600
Or with George Martin on our next show.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.480
This has been the science fiction radio show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

16:44.480 --> 16:48.960
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:14.480 --> 17:39.720
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

17:44.480 --> 18:04.000
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.680
And here are your hosts.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.760
This is Darryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.040
One of the most popular genres in mass market literature is the horror genre.

18:15.040 --> 18:19.360
We ask science fiction author George R.R. Martin, author of the recently published horror

18:19.360 --> 18:20.800
novel, Fever Dream.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.240
Why thanks to the horror genre is currently so successful?

18:24.240 --> 18:31.080
I think people may be going to horror because in horror novels we're scared, but we can

18:31.080 --> 18:35.000
kind of control the scares.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.440
And we can read the book and scare ourselves.

18:40.440 --> 18:44.920
But then we put down the book and we know that what we're afraid of vampires were wolves,

18:44.920 --> 18:53.240
haunted hotels, whatever is not real.

18:53.240 --> 18:57.520
And people don't mind dealing with that and kind of getting a little catharsis out of

18:57.520 --> 18:58.520
that.

18:58.520 --> 19:07.520
But they don't want to deal with real terrifying things, violence and streets and crime and

19:07.520 --> 19:10.040
crazed psychos out there.

19:10.040 --> 19:14.840
And the threat of nuclear holocaust and all of the other more real fears that also hang

19:14.840 --> 19:15.840
over us.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.200
I think that may be part of it.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.800
There are many creatures that embody horror in the literature.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.440
Ghosts, monsters, ghouls, werewolves, witches.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.440
But probably the most enduring image of horror is the vampire, the nocturnal stalker who drinks

19:27.440 --> 19:29.040
the blood of its unwary victims.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.360
The vampire legend spans many cultures.

19:31.360 --> 19:35.560
Here Martin tells us about the vampire legend and the reasons why the legend may be so popular

19:35.560 --> 19:37.760
even now.

19:37.760 --> 19:43.640
Vampires are an almost universal legend, which is one thing that turned out when I was researching

19:43.640 --> 19:46.880
fever dream.

19:46.880 --> 19:52.800
The vampires we're familiar with, of course, Dracula and his kin, so to speak, and all

19:52.800 --> 19:58.280
the books that are derived from that tradition are essentially retraces of Eastern European

19:58.280 --> 20:02.440
Romanian and Hungarian largely vampire legends.

20:02.440 --> 20:06.040
But if you look around the world, you'll find vampire legends everywhere.

20:06.040 --> 20:11.720
In China, in Africa, in the South seas, there are variants of the vampire legend.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.120
The details differ.

20:13.120 --> 20:20.120
But the basic vision of a nocturnal predator that trades on human beings is present in all

20:20.120 --> 20:21.720
of these.

20:22.720 --> 20:27.720
So that would lead you to wonder why do they have this universal appeal.

20:27.720 --> 20:35.000
The easy answer is to why they're appealing in our culture today in modern American mass

20:35.000 --> 20:40.120
society, I think, as the sexual nature of the vampire.

20:40.120 --> 20:48.040
The sexual symbolism embodied in Dracula and in the way it's been treated by Hollywood

20:48.040 --> 21:02.660
and the symbolism of vampires, the dubtor, is appealed something within us and makes

21:02.660 --> 21:10.400
gives legend a lot more resonances than say the werewolf legend or zombies or some of

21:10.400 --> 21:16.720
the other things that have never really achieved the popularity of the vampire legend.

21:16.720 --> 21:23.800
But then you could say well that's true for us, but it doesn't explain why the legend

21:23.800 --> 21:25.560
is so universal around the world.

21:25.560 --> 21:46.000
And indeed it doesn't, but I don't have an answer to that.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.200
One tells us here how we incorporated this universal transcultural concept of the vampire

21:50.200 --> 21:52.080
and fever dream.

21:52.080 --> 21:57.280
In terms of fever dream, I looked at that universality and I made it one of the bases when I started

21:57.280 --> 22:02.000
writing the novel, I said, what if the reason that these legends are universal is because

22:02.000 --> 22:03.760
they're all remembering the same thing.

22:03.760 --> 22:12.160
They're all remembering some kind of racial memory of a real man-like predatory animal,

22:12.160 --> 22:17.600
a drinking, that is somehow the basis for all the vampire legends.

22:17.600 --> 22:28.000
And that was the premise that I, of course, used in the fever dream.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.880
This has been the science fiction radio show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

22:31.880 --> 23:00.000
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
