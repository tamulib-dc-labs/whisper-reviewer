00:08.860 --> 00:12.860
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.580 --> 00:33.940
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.280
And here are your hosts.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.440
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.520
Locus is the trade newspaper in the science fiction field.

00:47.880 --> 00:52.060
1983 marked the 16th year of publication and Locus has won seven Hugo Awards.

00:52.220 --> 00:55.460
The founder of Locus is Charles Brown, whom we talked with recently.

00:55.880 --> 00:59.420
Here Brown tells us how and why he started Locus and how it has evolved.

00:59.420 --> 01:03.620
Well I started Locus in 1968.

01:04.820 --> 01:11.100
It started, one of the main reasons I started was I wanted to be able to learn how to write.

01:11.960 --> 01:15.520
I was a full-time fan, I could never seem to write anybody a letter.

01:16.380 --> 01:20.100
So I decided if I had myself a deadline at that time, it was over two weeks,

01:21.140 --> 01:25.100
I would get some experience with writing, I'll be able to write letters and things like that.

01:25.860 --> 01:31.000
Well it's fifteen years later, I still can't write letters, I'll just put out some magazines.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.460
It mainly evolved from being about fandom.

01:38.920 --> 01:43.800
It was done on every other weekend, it was written on Friday,

01:45.900 --> 01:49.940
stencils on Saturday, runoff and mail on Sunday.

01:50.920 --> 01:58.200
It was always every other weekend with a gang of people in the house helping out and things like that.

01:58.260 --> 01:58.980
It just kept growing.

02:00.680 --> 02:05.600
The one thing about our magazine is if you keep putting out issues you get more and more news.

02:07.280 --> 02:11.380
Gradually it changed over, more towards the professional side.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.720
Mainly because that's where my interests were.

02:16.060 --> 02:19.520
They were the people who responded more often than I was.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.080
Eventually it grew to a point where I couldn't print it anymore.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.900
We went to professional printing and it's been growing ever since.

02:29.540 --> 02:33.940
It's about the late of a short novel now, started out as just one page.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.960
So that's how it grew.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.740
Locus has grown to be a major force in the science fiction field.

02:40.740 --> 02:44.820
We asked Brown if in the early days he ever anticipated that Locus would get to be so important.

02:45.340 --> 02:50.500
Well no, it originally started out to only run for two years.

02:51.680 --> 03:00.560
One of the other things that started out was that this was a advertisement for the Boston group who was bidding for a world time.

03:02.260 --> 03:06.580
I just wrote the original and the Boston group put it out but that didn't work very well.

03:07.400 --> 03:11.460
At the end of two years they did win the convention, I think mainly because of Locus.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.940
But then we discovered that we were being nominated for a year ago.

03:17.560 --> 03:22.360
It seemed like it would be interesting to run it right through the Boston convention and try and win a year ago.

03:23.260 --> 03:25.560
Which we did and after that we just never stopped.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.440
But I never imagined it would grow that much.

03:31.220 --> 03:35.380
Brown worked for many years as an electrical engineer and produced Locus part time.

03:35.720 --> 03:36.720
Then that changed.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.620
There was a break in the engineering field in 1975.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.720
I got laid off for the first time in my life.

03:45.140 --> 03:50.340
I figured while I was waiting for the field to pick up again, I would try writing for the year.

03:51.760 --> 03:56.660
So I did. I wrote mostly nonfiction articles from magazines.

03:57.360 --> 04:02.860
I did Locus on the side and tried to build it up as much as possible.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.660
And eventually I discovered I didn't even have to go back to work.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.700
Every once in a while I get a call for an engineering job.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.560
I feel very good about that but I have no intention of doing that.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.540
One question that naturally springs to mind is, what is the origin of Locus?

04:21.540 --> 04:26.520
The name came from various points.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.000
Various things.

04:29.640 --> 04:35.160
Locus is the connecting point in a circle.

04:36.480 --> 04:44.400
We considered ourselves the connecting point for the science fiction professionals, fans and publishers.

04:45.260 --> 04:48.720
The other thing was just from the old Spanish phrase of L.R.C.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.700
The letter of comment.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.860
That's why the letter column is still called Locus for the capital of L.R.C.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.620
Join us on our next show when we'll talk more with Charles Brown.

05:07.660 --> 05:13.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:13.880 --> 05:16.780
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:30.620 --> 06:00.600
The Science Fiction Radio Show

06:00.600 --> 06:03.860
Next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:19.120 --> 06:24.920
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.220
And here are your hosts.

06:33.340 --> 06:34.560
This is Daryl Lane.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.260
And Bill Vernon.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.780
Locus is Science Fiction's leading trade magazine.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.540
It's written for professional writers and for serious readers.

06:41.060 --> 06:43.600
The professionals get information on prospective markets.

06:44.140 --> 06:47.920
The readers get up-to-date information on reviews, conventions and forthcoming books.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.780
But Locus has its roots in fandom.

06:50.280 --> 06:54.660
Charles Brown, its founder, editor and publisher, tells us how he discovered science fiction fandom

06:54.660 --> 06:56.360
soon after he began reading science fiction.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.440
Oh, I started reading science fiction.

07:00.460 --> 07:04.120
I was reading a founding in the 40s.

07:04.620 --> 07:08.620
And I started fandom all around 1949.

07:11.160 --> 07:19.960
By finding conventions listed in one of the magazines, Super Science Story, or something like that.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.580
I was to the 1950s convention.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.520
I was 12 years old when I went to this convention.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.220
I had a wonderful time.

07:29.340 --> 07:33.180
And I met all these old men, like Fred Cole and Bester Del Rey.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.040
They were old.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.260
Most of them were pushing 30.

07:38.700 --> 07:41.580
When you're 12, you don't think anybody's ever going to reach 30.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.040
It's really up there.

07:45.040 --> 07:52.040
And now it's frightening because I met two other people and they're considered the same age pretty much.

07:54.580 --> 07:56.680
But double-sword, silver fandom.

07:57.860 --> 08:01.040
And I put out my first fan scene about 1951.

08:03.480 --> 08:07.760
Dropped out again when I was in college.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.060
And things like that.

08:09.260 --> 08:12.020
And then she went back to the late 50s.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.680
So Brown has been involved in fandom since 1950.

08:16.340 --> 08:18.780
We asked him how fandom has changed through the years.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.300
1950, there were all these 13-year-old kids and I was right there.

08:25.740 --> 08:27.520
I was talking to Harlan Ellison today.

08:27.800 --> 08:35.020
He said the one thing he just came back from Australia, he was just a monarchy, an Australian convention.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.100
It's just like the American fandom of the 50s.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.940
There were all these 13-year-old kids and no women.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.740
They were all very sincere, very bright, and very socially inept.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.600
It's a pretty well-fandomed and most nice kid.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.240
Annually Brown conducts the Locust Poll.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.620
The Poll is a tally of readers' responses to such topics as favorite novels, short stories, artists, and so on.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.720
And it reveals some personal information as well.

09:09.260 --> 09:12.360
One bit of information is that the average Locust reader seems to be getting older.

09:13.140 --> 09:15.300
Our audience is always going to gotten older.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.960
Mainly because the audience has stayed with us.

09:19.760 --> 09:24.880
About 80% of the people who read Locust in 1968 still read Locust.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.420
Which of course keeps raising the ages.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.340
There are some new people, but not that many.

09:34.660 --> 09:39.220
What are the changes of course in the magazine?

09:39.420 --> 09:43.700
The magazine is no longer aimed at a teenage fan.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.020
It's aimed at professionals.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.020
Of course it means we attract the older professionals.

09:53.560 --> 09:59.620
I think there are probably no more than two or three professionals who are not the providers.

10:00.620 --> 10:03.320
Brown has been publishing Locust for 16 years.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.060
We ask him if he still gets satisfaction from it.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.240
I was looking at the Blue Lines for the new issue today.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.540
It was very exciting.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.260
The first time you see it come together.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.980
You see all the photographs together.

10:16.340 --> 10:18.620
All the stories in one place.

10:19.460 --> 10:20.160
The pieces.

10:23.820 --> 10:26.780
You still got a real thrill when you hold that first copy.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.880
I'll get my final copy tomorrow.

10:32.260 --> 10:36.220
I'll be down at the printer 8.30 in the morning watching it run off.

10:36.380 --> 10:38.900
I'll pull out a copy myself and stay put together.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.700
And then I'll have another copy.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.640
We'll have more with Charles Brown on our next show.

10:51.420 --> 10:54.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.400
A production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:57.400 --> 11:00.620
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.400
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.780
So stay with us.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.940
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.660
A commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:14.300 --> 12:14.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.000
And here are your hosts.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.200
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.420
Pick up a copy of Locust, Science Fiction's leading trade newspaper.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.820
Look inside the front page and you'll find a small box entitled Editorial Matters.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.800
In the editorial you'll find, among other acknowledgments,

12:35.040 --> 12:38.280
the names of people who helped collate, fold, and mail the copies of the issue.

12:38.460 --> 12:41.820
We asked Charles Brown, the founder, editor, and publisher of Locust,

12:41.820 --> 12:45.320
to describe how a typical Locust issue is put together prior to mailing.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.760
People come over to mail them.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.420
Well, it's not collated. It's mailing books.

12:51.540 --> 12:53.960
We get the picture back from the printer in the afternoon

12:53.960 --> 12:58.820
and one or two people may show up and help us put stamps on first-class copies.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.520
Then a larger crowd comes in the evening.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.300
You see over there's said dinner and sit around and drink and put out...

13:11.860 --> 13:14.860
We put all the labels on the thing and put it outside the order.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.280
And the chronological order by zip code.

13:18.620 --> 13:19.880
And there's fact-dots in.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.580
Usually we finish by about 10.30 or 11.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.080
Everybody sits around and talks about Science Fiction.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.420
Very few of the people are of what you call science.

13:30.580 --> 13:33.600
There almost all writers.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.960
In fact, we had a contest last year.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.280
It's the best first novel by a Locust co-lager.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.560
We did have three nominees.

13:44.420 --> 13:51.160
As far as I can tell, probably about 90% of the Locusts are collated with at least one novel.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.700
Locust has grown from a small fanzine to a professionally produced,

13:54.940 --> 13:56.360
nearly 50-page-long publication.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.500
We asked Brown if he plans to continue expanding Locusts.

13:59.660 --> 14:00.980
His answer may surprise you.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.620
Actually, I'd like to do the opposite.

14:03.620 --> 14:05.880
I do not want to expand the magazine at all.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.600
It will expand anyway. It always does.

14:08.900 --> 14:13.440
But I have no interest in doing a bigger magazine.

14:14.700 --> 14:18.680
In fact, I find a magazine too big now and the situation too bad.

14:20.380 --> 14:25.100
I really want to do a magazine for a limited number of people.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.860
Where I can do it all myself at home.

14:29.200 --> 14:34.760
I'm very frightened about getting to the point where I need a larger staff and an office.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.360
Everything is going at home right now.

14:39.760 --> 14:45.860
Some of the changes are always forced on us because there's more news that we feel we have to cover.

14:46.940 --> 14:50.740
As you probably noticed, we're doing a lot more international coverage lately.

14:52.800 --> 14:57.660
Covering the Soviet Union and the European Convention.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.960
And we've had articles on Chinese science.

15:03.440 --> 15:08.540
And I'm off to China next week to an other U.S. university,

15:08.780 --> 15:10.400
Shanghai, and South Korea, between there.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.640
Locust has caught seven Hugo awards so far.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.880
Is brown tiring and winning so many Hugo's?

15:32.540 --> 15:35.020
I don't get tired of winning them now. It's a lot of fun.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.500
There have been complaints but they don't bother me too much.

15:43.920 --> 15:48.060
I solved the problem with complaints. I sent Rachel out to pick them up every year.

15:51.820 --> 15:57.420
I won't stand for you as long as people vote for Locust, I'll gladly accept Hugo.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.540
Locust is a visible presence in the science fiction field.

16:01.740 --> 16:04.740
We asked Brown if it is a target for writers of crackpot letters.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.620
I tell you, I eat crackpot letters all the time.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.960
Really strange letters and we usually throw them out.

16:12.800 --> 16:18.020
The years we've collected all these really strange, far outlaid letters,

16:18.300 --> 16:20.840
ways waiting to publish them in a final issue.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.940
But it doesn't look like there will be a final issue with Locust.

16:25.260 --> 16:28.000
So there's no reason to keep them around anymore.

16:28.860 --> 16:31.920
If you're a serious science fiction fan, you need to be reading Locust.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.600
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.220
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:44.520 --> 16:47.700
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:01.920 --> 17:31.740
The Science Fiction Radio Show

17:34.440 --> 17:38.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:54.320 --> 17:59.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.960
And here are your hosts.

18:08.640 --> 18:09.720
This is Daryl Lane.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.360
And Bill Vernon.

18:10.840 --> 18:15.380
The late H.B.Piper created in his fiction a race of small, furry, sentient creatures called fuzzies.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.160
These cute aliens proved to be very popular with the fans.

18:18.620 --> 18:24.280
Fuzzy's figured in only two books, Little Fuzzy, and what was later called Fuzzy Sapiens, before Piper died.

18:24.820 --> 18:28.540
But according to Ardeth Mayhar, who recently wrote another installment in the Fuzzy saga entitled

18:28.540 --> 18:32.540
Golden Dream of Fuzzy Odyssey, the fuzzy series did not stop with Piper's death.

18:33.120 --> 18:37.260
Well, Mr. Piper died in 1966.

18:38.860 --> 18:42.000
A suicide, which was a very tragic thing.

18:42.760 --> 18:47.920
And he left a considerable literary estate.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.820
He had been writing rather successfully for a long time.

18:52.860 --> 18:57.040
There was sort of a hiatus there for a number of years

18:57.040 --> 19:01.420
until one of his friends, I believe it was Jerry Purnell, but I'm not certain,

19:02.080 --> 19:05.880
persuaded A's to purchase his literary estate.

19:06.380 --> 19:11.740
All the rights and all of his books and short stories and everything, which they did.

19:13.460 --> 19:23.040
And they reissued Little Fuzzy and Fuzzy Sapiens in a single volume under the fuzzy papers.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.680
And it was very successful.

19:25.340 --> 19:28.900
Had a built-in market of people who remembered the books.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.420
And so they decided that they wanted another book.

19:32.560 --> 19:40.960
So they turned to Mr. William Tuning, who wrote a third book, Fuzzy Bones, which I enjoyed very much.

19:41.260 --> 19:49.420
I based a great deal of the background of my book on the substructure that he had created for their historical background.

19:50.300 --> 19:54.240
After Tuning's effort, May Hart told us, she was asked to write a fuzzy novel.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.580
Here she tells us why.

19:56.600 --> 20:02.180
I believe it was Susan Allison, who was then the head science fiction editor at A's,

20:03.000 --> 20:06.660
decided that they wanted a book from the viewpoint of the little aliens.

20:08.020 --> 20:19.760
Well, my editor had just bought paperback rights to my first two double-day books.

20:19.820 --> 20:24.480
And she was in the process of putting them into production for A's.

20:24.900 --> 20:29.640
And she had had a great deal of back and forth conversation with my agent,

20:29.660 --> 20:33.480
who is still black staggered at how fast I am.

20:34.220 --> 20:38.880
And so one day the phone rang, that dear phone, it was Susan Allison.

20:39.760 --> 20:46.680
She said, would you be interested in writing a book to continue H. Bean Piper's fuzzy series?

20:46.820 --> 20:47.780
Are you familiar with mine?

20:47.960 --> 20:49.460
I said, yes, I've got my teeth on them.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.380
And she said, well, would you be interested?

20:51.740 --> 20:53.960
We want one from the viewpoint of the aliens.

20:54.800 --> 21:00.360
And she said, I shouldn't say this, but we were kicking it around the office

21:00.360 --> 21:03.560
and trying to figure who was extremely fast and partly alien.

21:03.740 --> 21:04.900
And naturally we thought of you.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.960
Well, I was flat, you know, because I am both.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.600
So I said, well, I'll tell you what, I will reread the books.

21:16.740 --> 21:24.420
And then I will write whatever feels comfortable so that I know how well I fit into a fuzzy skin.

21:24.420 --> 21:28.080
And you will be able to tell how well you like what I do.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.080
And then we'll go from there.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.100
To write about fuzzies, may her found it necessary to put herself in their place.

21:34.580 --> 21:35.880
This was in early February.

21:37.060 --> 21:42.380
So I sat down and it's a very funny thing.

21:42.560 --> 21:48.580
Becoming an alien is not all that difficult, but you have to have been a very peculiar child.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.880
You'll be able to do it well.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.980
So I remembered when I was two feet tall.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.500
I can remember back before I was two years old.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.220
I remembered how the world is full of shoes and kneecaps.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.720
You know, everything is tremendous.

22:06.140 --> 22:10.140
Shrubs or trees and trees are just something up there like clouds, you know.

22:10.500 --> 22:19.260
So I shrunk myself down to two feet tall and put myself on a world where everything thought I was delicious.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.000
And went from there.

22:23.060 --> 22:28.340
On our next show, we'll hear more from Ardath Mayhar on her writing of Golden Dream of Fuzzy Odyssey.

22:35.720 --> 22:41.180
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:41.440 --> 22:44.360
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.860
The next show is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.180
Stay with us!

23:53.180 --> 23:58.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.740
And here are your hosts.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.180
This is Bill Vernon.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.040
And Daryl Lane.

24:09.240 --> 24:12.720
H. Bean Piper's Fuzzy series was only two books long when he died.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.440
William Tuning wrote a third novel in this series called Fuzzy Bones.

24:16.440 --> 24:19.600
Then Ace Books asked Ardath Mayhar to write a fourth novel.

24:20.140 --> 24:24.400
Her continuation of the series, which came out in 1982, was called Golden Dream of Fuzzy Odyssey,

24:24.660 --> 24:26.120
and it's told from the viewpoint of the fuzzies.

24:26.360 --> 24:32.540
As we've learned in our last show, Mayhar used childhood memories to put herself mentally in the place of the two-foot-tall fuzzies.

24:32.820 --> 24:37.100
Mayhar's treatment of the fuzzies diverges quite a bit from the treatments given them by Piper and Tuning, though.

24:37.790 --> 24:47.360
The treatment of the fuzzies in both Piper and Tuning books is rather peripheral to the human story,

24:47.560 --> 24:54.940
and the fuzzies are given rather short shrift as sort of cutesy poo creatures.

24:55.920 --> 25:04.400
Okay, Mr. Tuning had set up that they had survived on this totally inimical planet for 1,200 years.

25:05.220 --> 25:10.320
So little helpless big-eyed cutesy poos don't survive for 1,200 years.

25:10.460 --> 25:15.560
You've got to have pretty bright, gritty little cats, or they're not going to make it.

25:25.900 --> 25:30.980
Mayhar also took the approach of answering some of the mysteries at which Piper and Tuning had only hinted.

25:30.980 --> 25:42.340
Well, I had some awfully neat questions to answer that had been set up in the other books and had never been addressed in those books.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.060
Why did they speak in ultrasonics?

25:47.020 --> 25:56.340
Why being obviously rational creatures capable of great affection were they sexually promiscuous?

25:57.000 --> 26:02.920
Oh, there were any number of questions that I had to answer.

26:03.000 --> 26:10.320
It was so funny because as I went, I just turned, okay, this is what they are, and I turned around and looked,

26:10.460 --> 26:13.220
and this was obviously the reason they were that way.

26:13.820 --> 26:19.740
They were sexually promiscuous, for instance, because when their spaceship crashed,

26:21.080 --> 26:24.780
a complement of only some 400 were aboard.

26:25.580 --> 26:30.320
And some half of those were subsequently killed in an earthquake.

26:31.240 --> 26:37.820
So you had a gene pool shared among something around 150 or 200 individuals.

26:38.260 --> 26:43.600
You had to spread your genetic heritage around.

26:44.140 --> 26:50.440
And so this would be a natural outgrowth of assigned breeding as long as they were in the original valley.

26:50.440 --> 26:56.200
And then when they went out, they retained this imperative from their leaders,

26:56.400 --> 26:58.980
you must do this for racial survival.

26:59.540 --> 27:02.220
There were any number of things like that.

27:02.740 --> 27:06.680
One of the reasons Mayhar was asked to write a fuzzy novel was that she can write at such a rapid pace.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.620
Ace needed the book as soon as they could get their hands on it.

27:10.100 --> 27:13.340
Here Mayhar comments on the production of Golden Dream, a fuzzy odyssey.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.960
Anyhow, they loved what I did.

27:16.220 --> 27:17.260
I loved what I did.

27:17.260 --> 27:20.460
I wrote that book, 100,000 words in six weeks.

27:22.760 --> 27:29.360
I sat on a wicker stool, which is now permanently imprinted on my derriere.

27:33.900 --> 27:38.340
My husband would come in, he would have left me sitting on the stool that morning.

27:38.580 --> 27:43.220
He'd come in that evening and say, you haven't eaten, have you?

27:43.820 --> 27:45.940
I'd say, eaten? What's eaten?

27:48.360 --> 27:50.300
But it was a lot of fun.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.680
Both the trade edition and the mass market edition of Golden Dream, a fuzzy odyssey,

27:54.860 --> 27:57.220
feature the same stunning Michael Whalen cover.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.380
We asked Mayhar if she had any input.

28:00.160 --> 28:08.100
No, but I knew it was going to be beautiful because Mike Whalen had done the covers for the Piper books and for the tuning book.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.040
And so I knew what he could do.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.740
We wondered if Mayhar would be willing to write another fuzzy novel.

28:13.500 --> 28:16.060
I just wouldn't mind at all writing another one.

28:16.060 --> 28:18.600
They're nice little people. They really are.

28:19.120 --> 28:23.220
On some of our future shows, we'll talk more with Ardath Mayhar about her other fiction.

28:30.820 --> 28:36.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:36.040 --> 28:39.340
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
