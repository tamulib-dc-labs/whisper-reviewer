Local Usage Element: [version history] 2025-07-19: WebVTT cleaned up by Corina Barr.

00:02.157 --> 00:04.440
Yeah, good stuff. And, you know, it only cost you about, so it's only costing me about $3 to get 30 copies of, I would say, 
six 10-page fans and, you know, Anne Zappa. Now, you know, I can afford $3, but I can't afford, I can't afford what Bruce is

00:14.552 --> 00:20.959
spending on this and Bruce is unemployed at the moment. And he's supposed to be going overseas and he's also furnishing a 
new house. Now, I'm not that dedicated.

00:30.951 --> 00:57.357
So, The panel obviously doesn't think, then, that the possibility of video cassette bandzines is on. Oh, I think it's 
quite likely, man. It's on... I think it's viable. At the World Convention last year there was a section on the techniques, a whole session in the convention, very very popular on the techniques of

01:01.842 --> 01:13.496
animation. This was a terrific crowd getter. The videotape at the moment is unreal to fandom. I'm lucky because I'm 
studying video tape and things like that, and I have access to machines and tape. It doesn't cost much. But yeah, that's

01:31.262 --> 01:33.265
what it is. Sir, are we talking about communications or communication technology? We're talking about communication 
amongst bands. That's right. Practicalities of communication? As a matter of fact, the best method of communication

01:48.169 --> 01:52.695
amongst fans isn't fan scenes at all. It's only one side, but the other one is conventions. For those people who would 
like to have a bird's-eye view of the Australian conventions, I've got the Australian Convention Handbooks here, as

01:56.800 --> 02:06.833
from the National Convention Number 3. And if anybody would like to have a look at these after the panel, I've got only 
2.2. It's an ad for 19 Somerset Place Melbourne, you may remember. This is Eastercon 72, the 10th Australian Science

02:19.249 --> 02:30.930
Fiction Convention at Melbourne University, cheaply memorable for the complete absence of laboratories.

02:31.687 --> 02:38.896
Eastercon 73, Mini Melcon 71, Etherline 2, Journal of the Modern Science Fiction. Eastercon 1968, 7th Australian 
Science Fiction Convention 1966, which started off the modern Renaissance. Bow everybody, bow your heads in

02:48.467 --> 02:50.710
reverence. The World Convention Program book for last year. Containing

02:54.094 --> 03:00.141
Harlan Ellison's signature. It's

03:00.526 --> 03:08.777
a small signature too.

03:10.860 --> 03:14.024
Put his hand prints in there. Art Plate from the 9th Australian Science Fiction Convention Handbook.

03:27.843 --> 03:27.883
Do How many panels have they considered? writing outside a ban. Now, this thing called communication, is it more 
important to them to communicate and give feedback or have they considered writing in other bills or what their

03:37.194 --> 03:52.475
attitude would be to writing in these other bills? Would they decline to write, say, a column in a newspaper or some other 
magazine? Right away about the lack of sleep. Yeah, well, I for one thought of the idea of writing professionally.

04:08.423 --> 04:09.845
Hasn't everybody. Also, it's one stage I applied for a cadet journalist, but decided against it because of the rat race, 
as it really is. Writing-wise, not much otherwise. I wouldn't mind films and photography and stuff like that. Some of

04:32.056 --> 04:40.445
those things, I don't do it for communication, that's done for my satisfaction, whereas fencing is done for feedback. 
It's very strange.

04:46.632 --> 04:59.667
Well, to answer Lee's question for myself, as Lee knows, Lee and I are doing some work at the moment, outside fencing is 
complete. I've

04:59.647 --> 05:14.162
been

04:59.647 --> 05:14.162
writing some short stories which are pretty terrible at the moment. Yeah, I think that there's probably actually more 
satisfaction in doing something which I know could appeal to a larger audience than in doing a fanzine. Fanzines are

05:23.943 --> 05:24.825
easy. Fanzines are very easy to write.

05:30.936 --> 05:36.646
But to write anything outside that field is hard. I personally don't. I think that I spend much time on the fans and I don't 
want to try and get a perfect looking thing. Sometimes I do a second draft and other times I just wake it up straight there.

05:53.301 --> 05:57.008
I've got my little bottle of Corfu, I like sniffing it as Michael Cooney would say. And that's all there is to it. I can 
whack out a stencil in about 12 minutes or something. Do you think you would get that kind of satisfaction that you get out

06:02.573 --> 06:09.900
of fanzines if you do something else? I don't know. If I get satisfaction out of fanzines now, you're upsetting me. What 
are you doing? Well, look, we're going to have to wind this panel up. So I think we'll just finish with Bruce Gillespie.

06:19.308 --> 06:20.089
You're all right. Just making one point about this business of challenge in fanzines. People contribute to fanzines on 
several levels, one of which it's just a fun thing and they do something without being terribly self-critical about

06:26.975 --> 06:38.005
what they do. Other people use fanzines to cut their literary teeth to find out the limits of what they can and can't do to 
improve their writing and so forth. As a matter of fact, some of the most popular science fiction authors, some of our

06:48.775 --> 06:56.982
best authors, Ted White, Harlan Ellison, are fans and cut their literary

06:56.962 --> 07:05.711
teeth. Some of these people that earn their living by writing, which is the only real test, are fans and learn to write 
within fanzines. I think the term is worth fanzines, surely? No, ah. This is still a fan. He wouldn't go to conventions.

07:22.267 --> 07:22.888
Are we hiding? You still a fan? No, I'm not a fan. What are you? He's probably come here for his morning, you know. Just 
because you've taken conventions, I mean, I don't like fancy articles. I... Bro, can I? There are a lot of things that

07:43.531 --> 07:45.513
fans didn't know. I don't consider myself a fan, I'm probably a latched fan. You know, I'm a latched Catholic. It still 
hangs on to you. They leave charisma there. What turns you on as meeting the people? No, is it the people? No, it's a... I

07:59.050 --> 08:12.511
think what you've read in Science Fiction has been part of fairing them, if you've done it at all seriously, it never 
fully lets you down. Some are withdrawals. They're from Science Fiction. I've come to all of this because I've cut the

08:15.856 --> 08:22.065
literary paper, the letter con of the magazine. Lots of fans cut their teeth to do that. They're called to make a dent 
before they were done fanzines. That's true. In every old amazing there was a little bit of fanzine. Well look, if David

08:34.214 --> 08:39.539
Greger or Ken Ford won anything else to say, just before we round like this. I'm struck dumb about it. I would say that I 
don't think fandom is a wild light. I don't think fandom is a goddamn hobby. I think that you agree with Bill Wright that

08:49.805 --> 08:57.533
Phantom is a process that we all go through. Some of us don't go through it though. But I also like to add my little personal 
little one. Phantom's a bloody nuisance. Well done, I think that's a good concluding note. Turn

09:10.505 --> 09:17.312
these off, we'll end this. We'll switch from three rounds and cheers. It's good fun. It's good fun. I'm a bit of a 
masochist. Make the ball clap, Mr. Chairman. Don't give us a clap. Yeah, come

09:27.011 --> 09:33.797
on, come on. On science fiction writers. If every one's agreeable to that. In about ten minutes time. I've been asked to 
moderate this thrilling panel. the subject of which I've forgotten, I think it's something to do with ethnic Aussie SF,

09:50.774 --> 09:57.402
or words to that nature. The gentleman on my right is Mr Eric Harris Harris, a resident of South Australia, and an author 
of some note, if you know your vision of tomorrows, Eric had several stories in the early issues, You've also published a

10:17.842 --> 10:20.665
book on astronomy, haven't you? That's right. I have a faintest idea what his occupation is, but that doesn't really 
matter. This gentleman here, you know, is Wynne Whiteford and the Holiesteam John Foester, earliest John Ozziean.

10:35.522 --> 10:36.143
Right. Now, as regards ethnic Australian SF, I will now pass you over firstly to John Foester to hear his comments on the 
subject. I think it must have been a conventional long time ago. Well, perhaps it was even before we had conventions

10:52.531 --> 11:14.865
again that this subject arose, certainly not the first time, but I think the first time, if I can recall, and there was a 
little bit of chat to and fro, probably involving Lee Harding, and I think also involving John Baxter. about the problem

11:15.824 --> 11:21.114
of writing uniquely Australian science fiction. And Mervyn Barrett, who of course is always sensible about these 
things, wrote briefly suggesting that we shouldn't be concentrating on Australia, uniquely Australian science

11:22.556 --> 11:39.047
fiction. Mervyn always likes to think cosmically. And so in this particular case he said, gentlemen, let us think 
globally. Let us try to write uniquely terren science fiction. Now, I think that what Mervin said is actually quite

11:54.080 --> 11:59.687
relevant to what's going on here today.

12:02.390 --> 12:07.857
There are lots and lots of ethnic science fiction types around. There's American science fiction, there's British 
science fiction, there's German science fiction, there's certainly Polish and Eastern European science fiction.

12:19.251 --> 12:22.635
And all of these are very, very distinguishable. perhaps with a few very notable exceptions. And to add one other 
uniquely nationalistic kind of science fiction doesn't seem to me to add very much to the pool and that what we do need to

12:26.472 --> 12:48.049
do perhaps is to write a science fiction which is suitable for everyone, not just for one country. Over and out. Right. 
Well, I think we should consider the two types, or the two distinct types of writing Australian

12:52.741 --> 13:06.550
SF if it comes to that. There is the form which utilises local background color. This is the simplest form and this 
applies really only if you're writing for local markets because you haven't got much chance of selling a science

13:12.225 --> 13:31.388
fiction novel on the international market that is say based in Australia. Although Cordway and Smith did it rather 
successfully. I'm going to ask Derek now who has written science fiction for the local market and if he could tell me if

13:35.887 --> 13:51.430
he's found it effective or not. Well quite frankly I have not found it effective. The general tendency seems to be 
amongst publishers anyway that we're not going to take a chance on the local boys. The reason for this is pretty well

14:04.827 --> 14:19.191
understood by everyone is attempted to write science fiction for a local market or for that matter any form of writing 
for the local market that you have the problem of distribution you have the problem of working in your own genre, so to

14:20.302 --> 14:46.039
speak, and the problem of distribution more or less rules out any hope of either launching a magazine, contributing to a 
magazine specifically for Australian conditions, or for that matter of writing for Australian conditions for an

14:20.302 --> 14:46.039
overseas market, except in a very limited sphere, which we attempted to do in the late lamented vision. I think there are 
a very large number of people throughout the world that are interested in the exotic and the exotics anywhere where

14:47.352 --> 14:54.624
you're not. And that of course includes Australia and there's no doubt about it. There isn't an abysmal ignorance of 
Australia and particularly the urban Australia scene. It'll only be the generally understood comic science fiction

15:02.657 --> 15:14.676
side, if you like, of the magma camels and the didgeridoo's and such like. But on the whole, no, I don't think that we do 
have any satisfactory outlet for local Australian talent.

15:26.733 --> 15:38.014
I suppose that, as I said before, that the exotic's always where you're not, and therefore there will be a limited 
amount, but as John pointed out, a full novel length novel length science fiction, the general idea is to write it in the

15:38.315 --> 16:03.283
neighbourhood of the novella and this of course limits you to a certain extent to develop a theme fully to understand the 
Australian background is very unlikely to be done in anything under 8,000 words and once you do that I'm afraid you'll

15:38.315 --> 16:03.283
have to rely upon an international market and not a local market. I know I've tried very hard particularly in the sphere 
of children's science fiction And in this alone, you've got to be extremely careful anyway, and the background here is

16:08.032 --> 16:17.060
far too localised. Our children are urban, they are in fact world urbanites already, and fast losing whatever 
Australian characteristics that they would be able to recognise in a children's novel. I'm speaking now and writing

16:31.413 --> 16:35.997
for children, but the same thing also applies to adult science fiction. No, quite frankly, I don't see that the local 
market is going to be much of an outlet for budding science fiction writers of any style, either the avant-garde or the

16:36.280 --> 16:49.792
old stuff. Well, considering the second aspect, I know one writer, a very prominent science fiction writer in this 
country, who to me, constantly infuses Australian characteristics into his stories, this of course is Bert Chandler.

17:15.317 --> 17:26.098
And he operates in the tried and proven way of supposedly writing about the far future. and at the same time writing about 
the here and now. His Rimworld stories, as most of you know, are really very fanciful variations on his own experience on

17:31.273 --> 17:48.037
the coastal run around Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. His characters, many of them are just about Australian as 
you can get, But because these stories are not localised and recognisably Australian, because they are set in the far,

17:54.563 --> 18:09.660
far future, Bert is obviously finding a way of writing a form of Australian science fiction. He has a novel coming from 
Wren Publishers in Melbourne, a new firm, a paperback publisher, which is an expansion of his story, The Bitter Pill,

18:10.220 --> 18:19.230
which is in vision. And it is a novel about a futuristic Australia. which was not accepted by any publisher overseas, 
which I think seems to indicate the point that you must write globally for science fiction. Now when you've been writing

18:38.373 --> 18:51.351
stuff many, many years ago when you're overseas in America and in England, did you consciously at any time when you were 
working for those markets try to inject Australian elements into your writing? Well, no, frankly, no. I think,

18:53.802 --> 19:04.655
economically, you have only one major market, that is America, for the simple reason that you've got a population of a 
couple of hundred millions. And this is about the only one where you can get a magazine with circulation approaching a

19:06.097 --> 19:13.486
couple of hundred thousand. Now, this applied, I think, in not only science fiction, but other. parts of magazines that 
I have contributed to. I think that what it is possible to do is what Frank Reining did in One Story that comes very much to

19:25.240 --> 19:37.539
mind, the place of the throwing stick. I don't know if you remember that, I think it appeared in Was It Galaxy? Fantastic 
universe and then a new world in England. That's right, certainly one of the American ones first. Well, now that, this,

19:50.258 --> 20:18.004
some of you may remember, I dealt with the warmer rocket range, extrapolated a little bit into the future, where a large 
rocket was going up and an aboriginal managed to get down near the launching pad and throw a boom ring into the vines that

19:50.258 --> 20:18.004
controlled the direction of the rocket so that you had a the most primitive type of weapon destroying or wrecking the 
probably the most advanced type about the place. Now that, in a sense, it was a bit of a gimmick story. It was essentially

20:30.989 --> 20:36.436
Australian because it's the only place where you could have that sort of thing happening.

20:39.600 --> 20:45.728
So that's another special case.

20:46.208 --> 20:49.172
Do you think there's any point in exploring the exotic part of Australia for overseas markets. I mean, like having a 
spaceport in the centre of Australia, do you think overseas investors would accept this as a reasonable extrapolation

20:51.946 --> 21:03.077
and marketing gimmick? Just possible, but I think that, frankly, I think it strains the credibility gap a bit far. I 
think you'd, again, have your spaceports where in countries where most of the space development is taking place. I

21:21.144 --> 21:23.146
don't think it would include women there. I think the Australian local in this case is a once only job. Yes. You might get 
away with it once and it's about all. And if you've done it well, nobody else can do it. That's right. Yes, nobody else can

21:35.500 --> 21:38.984
introduce a boomerang, not a prank. John, do you think there's a quality about any Australian science fiction writing 
which which does set it apart from the American or British equivalent?

21:52.164 --> 22:08.400
Well it seems to me that there's scarcely enough Australian science fiction to do this and if you were to try and 
summarize it I think it's really a matter of saying that Most Australian writers have their work published in British

22:09.308 --> 22:26.767
magazines and consequently the sort of fiction that seems to represent Australian science fiction is the sort of stuff 
that appeals to British editors. Now, it may appeal to British editors either because they like to see the Colonials

22:28.749 --> 22:36.497
making good or it may appeal to the British editors because it didn't appeal to the American editors who pay a lot more. 
Now, if it's the case that it didn't appeal to the American editors, then, of course, one could assume that, or one could

22:45.119 --> 23:02.443
assume in the days when there were a lot more American editors that perhaps the stories were so attention-grabbing. 
Nowadays, when there are fewer editors The prejudices might be very difficult to get around. It may be a different

23:11.909 --> 23:18.116
matter, but of course then there are no British magazines nowadays, apart from New Worlds. I think it's fair enough to 
say that in the past most Australian science fiction has been written by people who don't make the full-time thing of it

23:19.517 --> 23:33.293
the way even some of the British writers have done. Bert Chandler is about the nearest and of course he He does quite well 
without the science

23:36.923 --> 23:43.969
fiction. There's one, because I think the ideal thing is to sell a story in America first and then later in Britain. 
Sometimes you can bring that off, but you get about five times as much of it in the States as John has pointed out. But one

24:02.004 --> 24:06.508
thing that I think Germans have It is a field where editor contact I think is pretty important. If you can actually rough a 
story out and then contact the editor either by phone or else take the thing along to him just in a roughed out form and talk

24:12.995 --> 24:22.388
it over with him. And then sure on the sale, now you can't do this from a distance. Now I found that I was having to operate 
this way in America, to some extent. And then later when I went to England, I found that I sold mostly to Carnell. He goes, I

24:39.679 --> 24:42.262
could go along and actually talk to him or ring him up. Now, this saves a tremendous amount of possible lost time in 
duplicating a story that may have been put in by somebody else, or perhaps one that you've never heard of, but the editor

24:43.684 --> 24:57.043
may know. I think it's fairly important to be absolutely sure that you're selling the thing before you start, or I feel 
that way. I've got one little point about that and this is very important for everybody to pay very great attention to. I

25:12.557 --> 25:15.525
once wrote a very short story called The Superdense Man. I thought it was extremely good. I sent it to America and they 
told me, yes, This is a little bit, it needs pruning. You're obviously a young author and this needs pruning. I wasn't

25:25.827 --> 25:28.851
young, I'm in my 50s, but it said it needs pruning. So it got sent back, at least the rejection slip had a pen and ink signed 
on the editor on it. I sent it to Michael Moorcock before New World took its first plunge and he said, very good Eric, he

25:34.218 --> 25:43.270
said, but it's a little bit too broad approach. It needs a secondary theme. It needs to be a little bit larger. I sold it to 
the ABC, exactly the length that it was. And this is very important. It's the same story and it wasn't touched. I always

25:56.665 --> 26:07.074
make a practice of giving it a firm or copy than he needs so that he can cut a bit out to please himself and he still doesn't 
really harm your story. But now, there's been a lot of talk about loyalty in Australian, professional magazine again

26:07.534 --> 26:14.180
and all that sort of thing. Well, I'm really sure if I was the editor of such a magazine I would not consider trying to get it 
off the ground using stories by local writers using an Australian low car. Every second or third issue I might like to do

26:31.267 --> 26:43.142
this put in a story like that but I can't see a magazine using the work of Australian writers who wrote solely about 
Australian problems, Australian futures and Australian environment. It wouldn't be exotic enough.

26:53.973 --> 26:55.716
John, what do you think? Are there hopes for an Australian magazine? Well, you asked me this at each successive 
convention, Lee. It's quite obvious you're not satisfied with the answer. Get more doom laden. But on that particular

27:09.818 --> 27:17.871
facet of it, we would need stories from overseas writers as well, wouldn't we, to make it here? Frankly, I've said this at 
the other conventions, so you know already. You can't make a go of it in Australia in the orthodox way. You can't do it with

27:30.565 --> 27:32.307
a newsstand magazine. Now, if anything should convince people of that, it's what happened with rats. Rats, I don't 
think, has got many claims with all due respect to the editors and the many authors whose work has appeared in there, who

27:47.939 --> 27:50.301
are in this hall today. Myself, except the professor. I don't think that Rats had a terribly perfect, or that had, might 
be a little bit pessimistic. Has a very professional attitude towards either the writers or the readers, for that

27:59.951 --> 28:07.719
matter. Certainly it's improved as time's gone by. They proved it could be done. They proved it could be done, but if you 
were willing to lose that many hundred dollars a month, it could be done. And frankly, I think that Rats showed that

28:18.247 --> 28:28.143
something which had rather broader appeal than a science fiction magazine still couldn't succeed. Consequently, if 
you're trying to sell something in a science fiction line, you'd probably have to give it a title like, very small, that

28:30.326 --> 28:43.748
is science fiction, then about two-inch letters, four of them. and science fiction forum. People might just confuse it 
with another magazine and you get your money that way. I really feel that at a time when England can't support a science

28:55.089 --> 29:06.501
fiction magazine, talk about Australia doing it, is really getting way out. If you consider just the sales that amazing 
and fantastic have in the States, and the fact that in Australia, magazine would have additional problems of

29:14.947 --> 29:25.119
distribution over and above those, which amazing and fantastic fact. I think it's quite obvious that an orthodox 
approach to a science fiction magazine in Australia just wouldn't succeed. I don't think that an unorthodox one would

29:32.628 --> 29:44.903
succeed either, but it might have a better chance and that would be to try to do it in the form of a little literary magazine 
except that you pay the authors. And this, that's a possibility, provided you're willing to put a $1.50 or $2 price tag on

29:48.271 --> 29:57.461
it. And since Vertex has done just that, put the price on it, and it's published some pretty dreadful material models 
that I don't think it'll survive. But if Vertex does survive, then it suggests that there's possibly a market for a

30:09.628 --> 30:25.190
high-priced magazine, in which case Australia might succeed, provided that you're willing to sell about 150 copies in 
Australia and the rest in America.

30:27.734 --> 30:37.367
Eric, have you had any experience submitting to the local fiction type magazines like the KG Murray chain or any of those 
people? What sort of response have you had from them? Very generous and on the whole where they criticise quite

30:39.849 --> 30:47.602
constructive and useful criticism also a couple of sales.

30:50.728 --> 30:59.362
On the whole I think that the KG Murray and that type of magazine is a very good outlet for anybody attempting to break into 
a market. In fact it's one of the easiest ways I would say as far as local publishers are concerned for anything of book

31:00.719 --> 31:09.789
length so I say you've got a different story. Harking back to John's discussion of the possibility of an Australian 
magazine I really do feel that a shot in the, a literary shot in the arm such as has been given by the literary grants

31:10.790 --> 31:24.786
recently by this by this present government might have some sort of formal approach to get some form of subsidy for this 
sort of thing. Quite obviously any art form these days requires heavy subsidy, I think. The fact that the Lolli Shops and

31:38.242 --> 31:52.056
the big stores are absolutely chock-a-block full of science fiction and most of it rehash from way back seems to suggest 
to me that there's an eager public waiting to read this stuff. And as they are doing so, the problems are mainly

31:52.880 --> 32:02.411
distribution and or taking, virtually taking a financial chance. Now, of course, we can't do this. As you say, any 
magazine that you do like this is bound to fly for a few months and then hit the deck. But with a government subsidy, and

32:09.360 --> 32:20.693
this, I think, requires some careful thought on the part of people that are not only writers but aspiring writers to 
lobby, or to, in some, if you like, a quasi-official sense, say this convention, or any convention for that matter, to

32:20.892 --> 32:43.513
make some approach to some official in this respect, to say, well, is it possible to have a literary shot, and they are 
somewhat similar to the Council of Arts, the job that was done for new worlds in England. What do you think is possible to

32:45.455 --> 32:46.916
do that, John? Do you think it's... Well, after handing out one and a half million, they're probably willing to throw a 
few hundred in the direction of science fiction. But then Bert Chandler, as I said, doesn't need it. The approach that's

33:03.261 --> 33:13.216
being used by the federal government is, I think, to support ventures which have been started. And this seems to me to 
make some sort of business sense. How do the rest of you feel about the rather sharp division here between science

33:17.997 --> 33:24.588
fiction and other material? Do you think a blurring of that line of demarcation might help? I think if you find that sort 
of thing in some of Koji Murray's publications, man has been running things that you can only call science fiction

33:29.116 --> 33:37.590
stories for quite a long while. I think the Tenth and Mortal was one I remember missing about ten years ago. Oh, they do, do 
it steadily. They've even published Jack Waddon's when Damien Robert was editing. The whole business of Australian

33:53.187 --> 34:05.881
science fiction and how it actually works out, I think is best demonstrated by a little chore I had several months ago. 
Wake up, Robin. I was engaged for a couple of months working on a projected multimedia spectacle, as it was called at one

34:07.913 --> 34:19.806
stage, with a theatre in Melbourne. Now, initially, two writers were engaged to work up a synopsis, sort of utilising 
all these elements, live actors, music and screens. And I submitted a synopsis and the other writer submitted a

34:31.724 --> 34:41.858
synopsis and we had a meeting at the table one night and the synopsis passed around and we all sort of commented on it. And 
the other writer's synopsis included among its plot gimmicks is rock, an aboriginal dance,

34:42.398 --> 35:01.444
various or a magician, a medieval magician, but I don't think the Opera House came into it. But we had much talk and to do 
about this and in half an hour we decided that although the arts, the people in charge of artistic grants would be

35:04.864 --> 35:26.250
terribly pleased to see so much Australia scattered through the production, that when you have an opportunity like 
this, It's best to go the whole hog and do something which has meaning for everybody rather than which will just appeal to

35:26.568 --> 35:35.677
a minority. And so all those ideas were tossed out and we eventually went to work on something with much broader scope, 
which would be completely Australian in the people working on the production. And we were confident that this was

35:49.270 --> 35:56.457
sufficient, that why limit yourself to just one small thing when you can reach a whole audience. And I think this is 
something science fiction does and has to do, that it has the ability to reach past national barriers and someone in

36:02.206 --> 36:19.913
Russia or South Africa can read a story written by somebody in America and the national characteristics don't 
contribute all that much to a success. Are there any questions from the audience? Yes sir. One of the things that worries

36:24.618 --> 36:31.433
me about is this perennial question about should there be a state of concern in this area. And there's no concept to 
debate the country to want the more worthwhile aspect of satisfaction.

36:39.333 --> 36:41.695
on thinking that it may create. It seems to me that the concept of insisting that science fiction be about Australia's 
and Australia's context and so on, is that another principle that will stay for the sort of late criticism. It's one

36:56.148 --> 37:07.078
thing for us to go on to try to have magazines and so forth that use Australian authors, because they will be that 
Australian authors are restricted from the opportunities that other waters may have elsewhere in the world, and in

37:07.058 --> 37:11.984
so-so's worth while providing for them. But it's quite a different matter to do so with the sort of paperotic emphasis. I 
think what Bert Chandler has done is very good. I don't think Bert is doing it out of paperotic reason, but that's because

37:19.594 --> 37:22.818
it's so convenient. How do you do it, by the way? Well, I think, in all high expectations, what Wynn was saying, that the 
two distinct forms that we're familiar with, American science fiction and British science fiction, were created by

37:36.877 --> 37:42.282
markets, not by individual writers or any patriotism. It was the editors who helped to form the particular literary 
climate. And until we have a consistent publishing field here, we will continue to ape overseas styles. But if we had a

38:02.339 --> 38:05.702
really dynamic, John W. Campbell working in Australia, he would help to create a form of science fiction, I'm sure, 
which would be easily recognizable as different to the overseas. Yes, Bill? Look, could I bring up a point on that just

38:15.347 --> 38:18.632
before we... Just before we hit that point. ...while we touch that? On this point, about the two different types of 
science fiction developing in America and in England. Now, I think the American one was governed largely by people like

38:26.524 --> 38:34.255
Campbell and the other editors, the other editors of... the major papers there, Poucher. In England, I think that they 
were set mainly by that little scoring list that used to appear in New Worlds. You know where each story was rated first,

38:46.768 --> 38:52.796
second, third, fourth, fifth for the stories for the previous issue. Can't wind them up, you know. Well, he took a bit of 
notice on them. I know he might have had to build them up a bit. I think he had. I think he did get some replies. He used to

39:06.943 --> 39:11.231
write and tell me the actual percentage of readers who actually wrote letters into that thing. Yeah, there wasn't many, 
but I think he did have a sort of a type of thing back there. I think he did actually. It's one of those, anyway. He took them

39:23.835 --> 39:24.717
seriously. Well, I wouldn't say that. Well, the stories I always liked, we always wound up down the bottom of those 
things, you know, that's it. Yeah, perhaps you like them. Right, all this ballet and all that. Bill, what were you going

39:34.918 --> 39:37.603
to say?

39:44.688 --> 40:01.735
We're virtually an exclave of the European American culture, and that if we're going to produce anything 
distinctively Australian, sort of degenerates into one of the bare you could work here. Yes, but Bill, this is purely

40:01.915 --> 40:05.541
the background. I do maintain that there are things with the national character. which are valid and which will come out 
in a story of right, whether it's set 200 years in the future, it will come out, but not until there's a market to develop

40:09.713 --> 40:19.587
it. But the people in the megalopolis of Toronto are very much the same sort of people as there are in the megalopolis of 
Melbourne. You say that beautifully. Can I hear it again? I've written it many times, but I'm... I'd

40:37.692 --> 40:42.843
like to answer you on one of those points. I was many years ago in the Megapolis of London and at that particular time they 
were doing a serial called Journey into Space and it had a juxtaposition between Mars and Australia. Oh, the very, very

40:55.310 --> 40:58.073
clever and interesting one too. And one of the characters in there, Mitch, was, I never, Australia's just cardboard 
characters as far as I'm concerned, but I remember being completely thrilled by this Australian background. I don't

41:10.629 --> 41:16.136
know whether an Australian author wrote this particular thing, but nevertheless, there's no argument about it. You do 
write best about that which you know. And if you know the Australian locale, you can write far more convincingly than you

41:19.120 --> 41:24.145
would say in America. Good. I'm going to wind this up in a moment. We've got time for one more question. Here's Ken. We've

41:31.133 --> 41:47.811
got that already, Ken.

41:51.233 --> 41:56.624
Yeah, that's what I reckon. Any dissension on that point? No, I consider Jack Waddon as an Australian. Yes, I do. Okay, 
well thank you John, Wyn, Eric and thank you Lee. We're vacating this so the next programme item can go on as scheduled.

42:11.874 --> 42:13.056
Thank you for your attention.

42:15.955 --> 42:25.665
She's

42:15.955 --> 42:25.665
a lecturer at Linda's University and she's going to be speaking on children's fantasy.

42:33.973 --> 42:41.440
I ask that it should be said that I don't know very much about science fiction before I started and so I'm saying it. I read 
science fiction a bit, but I couldn't profess to be expert about it in any way at all. But it occurred to me that readers of

42:51.049 --> 43:06.769
science fiction might be aware that they have some things in common with readers of fantasy, but that they might be less 
aware that they have the same things in common with readers of children's books. The title of a collection of essays that

43:08.757 --> 43:21.114
arose out of the MLA's forum on science fiction, which was edited by Thomas Clarison in 71, is, I think, interesting in 
this respect. It's called SF, The Other Side of Realism.

43:26.982 --> 43:38.157
And the title of a more recently published collection of essays on children's literature, also arising out of an MLA 
seminar, The Seminar on Children's Literature, was the great excluded. Now the definite article used in both of those

43:40.271 --> 43:51.046
titles indicates, I think, a degree of unawareness of each other among the two groups. It seems to me that we may be 
involved in the same difficulties and engaged in the same struggle without benefiting from mutual support and

43:53.009 --> 44:03.464
encouragement.

44:05.768 --> 44:06.709
So I'm here today not as an expert on science fiction, which I couldn't claim to be, but to express, and I hope elicit, 
feelings of solidarity.

44:18.939 --> 44:27.391
The introductory essay in that Clairson collection begins with the point made by Fred Poll at the MLA SF Forum in 68. The 
point that, and I quote, It didn't matter what had been written in the field of science fiction. The real difficulty in

44:34.871 --> 44:59.258
obtaining a critical hearing, particularly among librarians and academics at all levels, lay in that from 1926, when 
Hugo Gernsback founded Amazing Stories, the first pulp devoted exclusively to the genre, until the 1940s at least, SF

44:34.871 --> 44:59.258
had lived amid garish covers and poor print and rough edges, so that You usually carry them home under your coat because 
you didn't want anyone to know what you were reading. That situation is quite familiar to me and to students in my

45:07.397 --> 45:12.363
children's literature course. They tend to carry their books around under their coat too. But the important phrase is 
the real difficulty in obtaining a critical hearing. And it arose, I think, out of being identified in the critical mind

45:23.316 --> 45:29.363
with popular rather than with serious literature. And this is a difficulty which children's literature also faces. 
Although it has the support of some librarians, who are known as children's librarians, and some academics like

45:36.909 --> 45:54.118
myself, who are known as our expert on kitty lit, it's not discussed in histories of 20th century literature, nor do 
works of children's literature any more commonly than science fiction books turn up on academic English courses

45:54.824 --> 46:03.755
devoted to the modern novel.

46:06.519 --> 46:16.832
The other similarity between the position of science fiction and the position of children's literature is indicated 
by that title of the Claeson Collection of Essays, The Other Side of Realism. In fact, although like SF, children's

46:18.905 --> 46:27.715
books, especially written for children, can be traced back earlier to the early 18th century. In fact, Gulliver's 
travels is a very interesting text for the history of both our genres. The concept of children's literature dates from

46:33.000 --> 46:43.251
exactly the same period, that is the 1870s and 1880s, as does the concept of science fiction. And it was affected in 
exactly the same way by the acceptance of realism as a criterion for seriousness in the novel. In fact, I was very, very

46:53.674 --> 47:02.447
struck when I read this in Clairson's own essay in this collection, this paragraph. He points out that the realist 
doctrine, we might call it, was in fact based at least in the way that Zola argued for it on some analogy with scientific

47:07.775 --> 47:22.149
procedure so that the modern realist novel could have been called science fiction, but it wasn't. Instead, he said, 
that name has been given to a kind of fantasy which took shape as a diverse recognizable genre during the same period

47:23.029 --> 47:37.343
which saw the rise of literary realism 1870 to 1910. It made use of such established conventions as the imaginary voyage 
and the utopia, and had seen earlier expression in the works of such authors as Mary Shelley and Poe, but it didn't

47:37.846 --> 47:55.450
coalesce into a distinctly separate modern fantasy until the last decades of the 19th century. The parallel with 
children's literature is very, very exact. In fact, I opened the very first lecture I ever gave at Fender's on

47:59.713 --> 48:07.924
children's literature by pointing to just that period as a period of crisis.

48:10.508 --> 48:17.558
It certainly was decisive in the development of 20th century prose fiction and attitudes towards it. In England, the 
advocate of that new wave fashion as it then was of realism was Henry James. And from the point of view of children's

48:28.536 --> 48:36.583
literature, the opposition between Henry James and Robert Louis Stevenson is most instructive. From the point of view 
of science fiction, I suppose, it's the opposition between James and H.G. Wells, which is illuminating.

48:47.653 --> 48:54.799
Now at the time that realism was adopted from France into English criticism, it seemed to mean two disparate things. 
First, that the artist should aim for very similitude in presentation. And secondly, that novels should include

49:03.902 --> 49:13.432
previously prohibited material, which at that time largely referred to sex and the working class. Now, as far as the 
requirement for various similitudes concerned, It's only really checkable, if you think about it, in novels about

49:22.403 --> 49:27.950
contemporary life. Novels set in the past, in the future, or in some completely imaginary world, are simply not 
checkable for their very similitude. And Henry James demanded that novels be checkable in this way. He liked, he said,

49:44.852 --> 49:49.879
to be able to say yes or no, at any stage of reading a novel. And he suggested that this is how novels should be read, 
dispassionately, objectively, with the reader keeping a sufficient distance from the book to be able to judge its

49:53.020 --> 50:05.854
truth. In other words, I presume its truth to life in what was being presented. Now, you can see how this rules out 
fantasy, which is not about real life by definition. And you can see also how it rules out the historical novel, which

50:19.897 --> 50:26.987
might have been checkable once, but no longer is. And an SF book, which is set in the future, is in a very odd position in 
this argument. It perhaps can be seen in retrospect to have been a very good book. Or it can become a very good book. But it

50:42.029 --> 50:47.237
can't be a good book or be known to be a good book at the time of publication. Well, that's an absurd situation, since the 
book hasn't changed, nor has the literary value by which it's being measured, that of being true to life. So if the book

50:57.332 --> 51:01.640
hasn't changed and the values haven't changed, how can it get better? Or qualify in any other way for being called good? 
And I think that the tendency to make the value of SF dependent on the accuracy of its predictions was a somewhat

51:14.420 --> 51:33.183
indefensible critical attitude which was brought about by pressure from that criterion of being true to life, which 
was an effect, again, of the rise to dominance of realism as the definition of a serious novel, a novel that could be

51:14.420 --> 51:33.183
considered as a work of art. The criticism of children's literature has been forced into some equally absurd postures, 
you'll be glad to know, by this pressure from realism. If you read books about children's literature and turn to the

51:43.816 --> 51:58.602
chapter on fantasy, you'll almost invariably find the critic expending a great deal of energy explaining how it is that 
fantasy is good for children, though not good for adults. They will tell you that children like fantasy and adults don't

51:58.970 --> 52:10.084
and probably explain this with some reference to the recapitulation theory of human development. That is the theory 
sometimes called the culture epoch theory where each individual recapitulates the development of the species as a

52:10.104 --> 52:19.797
whole. Thus, according to this theory, children are like primitives. They're ignorant and curious about the world and 
seek explanations in fantasy because they cannot differentiate between a plausible and an implausible explanation.

52:37.091 --> 52:47.944
And you'll notice in passing that this assumes that children like fantasy because they believe it's true, whereas 
adults dislike it because they know it's not. There's a great deal of interesting discussion hinging on that too. For

52:52.785 --> 53:17.155
the moment, all I wish to point out is that critics of children's literature have come up with elaborate explanations 
for what may not be the case at all, namely that children like fantasy and adults don't, largely because they've been

52:52.785 --> 53:17.155
unwilling to face the fact that fantasy had been merely abandoned by influential writers and critics when they adopted 
the somewhat narrow version of realism which flourished in the first half of this century. And this seems to me to be

53:21.196 --> 53:31.208
exactly comparable to the reaction of SF critics who were willing to have the excellence of SF as literature depend on 
the accuracy of its predictions. So that it could be seen at least in retrospect as having been true to life, or being true

53:32.850 --> 53:40.399
to life. Now the second aspect of realism that I mentioned was the inclusion of previously prohibited material Now that 
was advocated by Henry James in an essay that he published on the brink of this century in 1899 called The Future of the

53:47.830 --> 53:56.624
Novel. And he complained about the absence of sex, which by the way he called, quote, the great relation between men and 
women, the constant world renewal, in the English novel. The reason he advanced was that the English novel had been

54:12.265 --> 54:26.234
handicapped by its family readership, by what he called the presence of the ladies and the children, by whom, he said, in 
other words, I mean the reader, irreflective and uncritical. The future of the novel The future of the novel, which she

54:30.338 --> 54:42.394
also called, in other words, the great prose fable, rested, according to James, on, what it decided to do with respect to 
the young. He declared, in fact, by what it decides to do with respect to the young, the great prose fable will, from any

54:43.495 --> 54:53.528
serious point of view, practically see itself stand or fall. And in fact, what James was recommending was that the 
children be sent away to play. with their mothers, of course, so that the serious novelist could be free to talk about

55:00.663 --> 55:05.848
sex. And since he classed all but novels about contemporary life, non-serious or romances, that included Jules Verne 
and H.G. Wells as well as Robert Louis Stevenson. This exclusion has done incalculable harm to children's reading.

55:26.026 --> 55:34.458
Books were divided then into serious literature for adults, one might almost say adult males only, and the rest. And the 
rest, seeing themselves as popular literature, defined themselves thus in negatives. Now, since James made so much of

55:43.771 --> 55:53.164
his case rest on the young, it's not surprising that the effect was most noticeable in the area of children's 
literature. Since serious novels were defined as dealing with sex, children's literature was defined as not dealing

55:53.633 --> 56:05.395
with sex, which has been kept out of children's books successfully for most of the last 70 years. And the fuss you might 
have noticed in the press recently about what's called the new realism in children's books is in fact an attempt to

56:13.394 --> 56:28.619
reintroduce topics such as sex, politics, satire and so on into children's books and thus catch up 70 years later with 
serious adult fiction. Now one expects that reaction in children's literature but it's surprising that I've found

56:35.618 --> 56:39.164
that something very similar seemed to happen in science fiction. Until the last few years I understand sex has been 
strikingly absent from science fiction, and there too has fairly recently, that isn't the last decade, made a

56:40.286 --> 56:50.525
comeback. Someone might be able to put me right on that point, but it's what I've gathered from my recent reading. I think 
it's an indication of the pervasiveness of that elitist critical doctrine of James's that it so successfully

56:56.324 --> 57:11.620
preempted the topic of sex from all other modes of serious writing, except the so-called realistic.

57:14.744 --> 57:25.335
Well, having sketched some ways in which I believe that the rise of realism had a similar impact on the genre of 
children's literature and on the one hand and science fiction on the other, And I'd like to turn to some of the effects of

57:26.446 --> 57:30.491
that joint exclusion. And it seems to me that they are by and large, though not wholly, bad. And that for that reason, it is 
proper to try to achieve serious critical consideration for our respective genre, rather than to give away the whole

57:36.359 --> 57:51.880
business of literary criticism and especially academic literary criticism as a bad elitist job. Now, the worst 
effect, I think, of being identified as popular rather than as serious seems to me to be conservatism.

58:04.430 --> 58:12.990
John would get defined by publishers, bookshops and exchanges by an estimation which they make of a book's market. If 
you go into a book exchange looking for Dune, you go to the science fiction section. But where do you find war and peace? In

58:22.288 --> 58:23.469
the war book section? And crime and punishment in the murder mystery section? Now all the sections say science fiction, 
war, murder, romance, historical, children and so on. and the market for each is predicted by the publisher and a book

58:36.089 --> 58:58.418
which has no predictable market and yet is clearly not serious literature on which you might be prepared to take a risk 
for prestige reasons, for instance that it's fantasy but it seems to be written towards adults or something, will have

58:36.089 --> 58:58.418
great difficulty in getting published at all. You see Mr Swift All books about little people go into the children's 
section and children are just not interested in politics, so I'm afraid Mr Swift, that although we thought your travel

59:00.794 --> 59:12.947
book was just fascinating, we have to turn it down.

59:14.480 --> 59:27.697
So stereotypes of an audience get built up by people who are obviously not willing to risk money backing an experiment in 
something that's meant to be popular, whoever heard of a non-popular, popular novel. And so second-hand shots, I

59:29.059 --> 59:31.022
suppose. And in fact, These stereotypes limit what reaches the audience and in turn make the audience more limited in 
its tastes and so become self-fulfilling. And all this operates against the emergence of outstanding or

59:46.228 --> 59:56.788
revolutionary writers and this operates against development, change and advances in the genre. So being identified 
as popular rather than serious literature can have the effect of making a genre as a whole conservative and

59:58.591 --> 01:00:09.328
discouraging of experiment, which I think is a bad thing. Another effect is to encourage the idea that popularity is an 
index of merits. And I think this might, if I understand your program correctly, be reflected in your procedure for

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:26.995
awarding your DITMA awards on the basis of a majority vote. Now, you might argue that anyone interested in coming to the 
conference must be an expert in the sense of having read a fair amount of science fiction. But I suggest to you that that

01:00:37.418 --> 01:00:44.225
isn't a criteria used elsewhere for selecting people whose judgment you can trust. Criticism is, I think, a very 
practical business. We read the critics or reviewers whose judgment we've learned to trust. in the expectation that

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:58.271
they'll help us enjoy books more or enjoy more books. And we select those critics on the basis of experience. That is, the 
critics who produced more recommendations which turned out to be fulfilled in our experience of the book

01:01:02.577 --> 01:01:12.171
subsequently. And we discriminate between critics and reviewers constantly on those grounds. And the grounds that 
the critics offer to us are not those of popularity. I don't think we'd be much influenced by a reviewer who says, read

01:01:23.448 --> 01:01:29.581
this, because a million other people have read it. No matter how many copies are, for instance, an Agatha Christie novel 
is sold, we won't believe that it's a better novel than crime and punishment on those grounds.

01:01:41.343 --> 01:01:49.817
Now in the field of children's books, all sorts of peculiar arguments are constructed to explain why popularity should 
be taken into account. It's suggested, for instance, that since children's tastes are absolutely different from

01:01:50.759 --> 01:01:59.233
adults' tastes, there's no way of finding out what's best for them other than by observing their own preferences. Thus, 
there was some official critical justification at hand for those who protested against the dropping of Enid Blyton

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:11.669
from children's libraries. But children love her books was the cry. You'd never hear people seriously argue that 
children should have lollies for breakfast just because that's what they'd prefer. The reason being that people know

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:28.225
that something other than taste is involved, nutrition. And some children's literature critics try to make use of this 
analogy by talking about a healthy, emotional and intellectual diet for the proper mental development of children.

01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:43.883
And I'm afraid that sort of talk makes me feel a bit sick. I think, however, that one can construct an argument without 
having recourse to that analogy on the grounds that it's better in the long run for people to have experience of a variety

01:02:43.903 --> 01:03:01.247
of tastes, and even that some tastes are more satisfying than others. So the child who gets a proper balanced, 
nutritious diet, all tasting of lollies, is still being deprived. I believe you've probably come across arguments of

01:03:10.762 --> 01:03:20.076
that sort in relation to the supposed dehydrated carefully selected tablet-formed meals of the supposed future. But 
the general point is, of course, that are made in those books and that I'm making now is that tastes can develop and they

01:03:21.858 --> 01:03:33.615
can improve and that in our ordinary behaviour we assume that to be so. even if you find some people, and some of them, I'm 
afraid, colleagues of mine in English departments, arguing that all taste is relative and de Gustivus Norne's

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:44.385
district handle. And therefore, that popularity is not necessarily the best index of merit. What we look for is 
qualified critics, the critics that we have learned from our experience, that we can trust their judgment. Now genres

01:04:00.207 --> 01:04:17.355
such as children's literature and science fiction, which were some 70 years ago or so pushed willy-nilly into the class 
of popular literature, have, I'm suggesting, suffered from the temptation to regard popularity as an index of merit.

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:33.744
So on these and other grounds, I think it's vital to keep fighting for critical recognition for the best books in our 
genres and not to give up and disgust, no matter how irrational or prejudiced the opposition may be. Now, within

01:04:36.388 --> 01:04:44.440
children's literature, the impression I have after a few years' fairly intensive reading and teaching is that the 
majority of the best books published for children over the last 40 or 50 years have been fantasy of one kind or another.

01:04:53.046 --> 01:04:57.051
And the reasons for this are not far to seek. Fantasists found it virtually impossible to find an audience elsewhere, 
that is, to get their work published except as children's literature. So, fantasists, no matter how good, were forced

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:12.891
to write for children. A realistic writer's work could get published as an adult book, even if it concerned a child or an 
adolescent, like a book like The Catcher in the Rye is a case in point. But a fantasist could not. And on the other hand,

01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:38.845
it's also true that fantasy was so despised that one could get away with a great deal by writing in fantasy which one could 
not get away with in realism for children. So a writer who wanted to write for children would be likely to turn to fantasy

01:05:39.382 --> 01:05:49.117
to escape the cramping restrictions placed on pseudo realism for children.

01:05:51.921 --> 01:06:02.537
Now when I think of these best works over the last 50 years, I find that titles that come most readily to mind tend not to be 
works in science fiction. But if anything, they're oriented towards the past and towards historical fantasy. I'm

01:06:08.622 --> 01:06:12.505
thinking of not only writers like Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, but Philip of Pierce, Tom's Midnight Garden, Alan Garner's 
Owl Service, Elador, Moon of Gomorrah, William Main's Earth Fasts, Lucy Boston's Green No Books, Mary Norton's

01:06:12.545 --> 01:06:33.165
Borrowers Books, and most recently, Russell Holman's Marvellous Book, The Mouse and His Child, which I recommend. 
Now, I'm afraid that the reason for the absence of science fiction from the list is not far to see, either. And that is this

01:06:43.276 --> 01:06:44.999
outlet. The outlet for adult science fiction was available in the magazines, which we've just been talking about, and 
which have played such an important part in the development of your genre. And the depressing thing is that when writers

01:06:58.508 --> 01:07:12.346
can get the adult audience, especially if it's the adult male audience, that is what they'll go for, and leave 
second-rateers to fall back on writing for children. I say especially in adult male audience because we might compare

01:07:13.728 --> 01:07:24.803
the situation in children's literature of science fiction with that of the historical novel, the straight historical 
novel. You remember that the historical novel was disqualified in the same way that SF set in the future was

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:34.381
disqualified from consideration as true to life. And you remember further that the genres pushed out into the popular 
literature category got market typed. Well, it seems clear to me that science fiction got market typed as male and the

01:07:43.097 --> 01:07:50.790
historical novel got market typed as female. The readership of science fiction is, I think, still largely male, and 
that of the historical novel is females and children. The historical novel has in fact flourished much more in

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:08.458
children's literature than has, until recently, science fiction. And that clearly shows, I think, that when a genre is 
relegated to women and children readers, writers would assume right for children as for women. But where they have an

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:27.409
opportunity to write for a male adult audience, they will take it more readily and not entertain the possibility of 
writing for children. And I suspect, though I might again be corrected that the The slow trickle of women writers into

01:08:32.148 --> 01:08:39.140
the field of science fiction has increased the chances of science fiction getting written for children. Since that's 
another amiable feature of the influence of sex stereotypes on reading habits, that it's assumed that women will want

01:08:39.821 --> 01:08:47.575
to write for children.

01:08:50.272 --> 01:09:02.108
Although I haven't come across as yet any work of science fiction for children, which is as good as the fantasy works 
which I cited earlier, I have come across some ones that I think are very good. And one of the features which makes books

01:09:02.128 --> 01:09:13.123
less than first-rate, I think, is the assumption that issues must be simplified for children. And one side effect of 
this is that you tend to get very clear statements of the going themes and perhaps prejudices in books for children,

01:09:14.285 --> 01:09:27.561
which is in often itself to make them interesting reading. So I thought that it would be of some interest to compare in 
some detail two children's books, which both seem to me to be very good, though not at the first rank, one of which is

01:09:41.707 --> 01:09:47.395
science fiction, nor not purely science fiction, and the other, historical fantasy. Both of these are described as 
mixtures, incidentally, in their blurbs. The science fiction book is described as a mixture of science fiction and

01:09:52.081 --> 01:10:01.774
fantasy, and the historical fantasy is described as a mixture of fantasy and truth.

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:17.407
Now, these two books, that's Madeline Lengel's A Wrinkle in Time, which some of you might know, and Pauline Clark's The 
Twelve and the Genie, both came out about 10 years ago, I think in the same year. And Madeline Lengel's book won the

01:10:17.967 --> 01:10:24.877
Newbury Medal, the children's books in America, and Pauline Clark's the English Medal, Carnegie Medal. So I think 
they're very comparable as books. Now, Madeline Lengel's book, A Wrinkle in Time, concerns three children who go on a

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:44.412
quest through a tesseract or wrinkle in time in search of a scientist who's the father of two of them. They have to rescue 
their father from the dark planet Kamazotz, which is in the power of an evil force, customarily referred to as it.

01:10:55.226 --> 01:10:58.069
They're given some initial assistance by three Aliens, I suppose they are, who in the form that they most frequently 
materialise before the children are three rather comic old women, which is really Mrs. What's It, Mrs. Who and Mrs.

01:10:58.336 --> 01:11:11.298
Which. Now apart from rescuing their father, the children are in this action participants in a wider struggle between 
the evil force represented by it, and the rest of the universe, which is trying to resist being engulfed. And we gather,

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:40.649
though it's not explained, that merely getting their father back alive constitutes a major, though temporary, 
victory in this ongoing struggle. Something like Don Kirk, in fact. Now, the Twelve and the Genie also involves three

01:11:44.435 --> 01:11:49.723
children and a rescue mission. One of these children finds in these three are siblings. One of them finds in the attic of 
their New Yorkshire home, an old bundle containing 12 century old wooden soldiers, which he unexpectedly discovers a

01:11:55.686 --> 01:12:21.027
capable of coming to life, and that they have lengthy and interesting histories of former campaigns, and names such as 
Buttercrashie and Gravy and Cheehee and Stumps and so on, and that they were formally protected by some children, or at

01:12:21.344 --> 01:12:26.530
least humans, that they refer to as the genie. And this child, Max, who discovers them, they refer to as a new genie. And 
Max and his sister, two of the children, become protectors of the gallant troupe. The troupe is known as the 12, the

01:12:38.284 --> 01:12:41.087
children as the genie. They learn, however, that the toys of the former property of the Bronte family, who invented the 
stories and then doubt the toys with the history that the toys recount to them, and whose former home, Holworth, is

01:12:49.694 --> 01:12:57.038
nearby. The existence of the soldiers, however, is a matter of historical interest, especially to literary 
academics. And an American professor offers to buy them for 5,000 pounds. And the third child of the family, an older

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:21.303
boy, who along with his parents and everyone else doesn't know of the special properties of animation of the soldiers, 
writes offering to sell them. And as the prospect of being sent to some American museum doesn't appeal to the 12, the two

01:13:27.224 --> 01:13:32.570
children determined to return the soldiers to their former home at Horworth instead. But fittingly, the soldiers must 
be allowed to retain their dignity, freedom and independence by making the massive two or three mile trek themselves at

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:49.570
night and in secret because the place is soon swarming with reporters and people both greedy and curious. And the 
mission is accomplished, as is the mission in Wrinkle in Time, with some nasty moments and mishaps. And the toys are

01:13:56.289 --> 01:14:04.791
returned to the Harworth nursery, where they are frozen wooden soldiers with featureless faces by day and living 
personalities by night.

01:14:07.454 --> 01:14:20.494
Now, the way that these two stories, which are both very interesting and readable, reveal some of the common places, as 
it were, of the genres to which they belong is likely through theme and characterisation rather than through plot. As I

01:14:21.255 --> 01:14:26.302
have indicated, both plots are structured on the old rescue quest motif. But consider first the themes and 
characterisation of a wrinkle in time. The central character in that novel is a pubescent girl who's introduced as a

01:14:37.137 --> 01:14:44.567
plain, awkward, misfit, warmly attached to her family, but not a failure at school. She has in fact the classical, ugly 
duckling attributes, raises on her teeth, and mouse-brown hair, and we can predict, I think, from these props that

01:14:45.188 --> 01:14:55.461
she'll turn out to be a swan. The sibling to whom she's particularly attached, and with whom she shares her adventure, is 
her baby brother, Charles Wallace. Again, we can deduce that he is introduced as having, that he is special from the fact

01:15:07.192 --> 01:15:15.984
that he's introduced as having the local reputation of being subnormal in the neighborhood. And we can deduce from that 
the fact that he is indeed a genius. But just in case we're in any doubt on that point, the third page of the story, when

01:15:21.692 --> 01:15:36.692
nothing much has appeared except Meg's thoughts as she gets out of bed on a windy night, her reflections are extended to 
include the following reminiscence. thinking about Charles Wallace. How did Charles Wallace always know about her?

01:15:44.969 --> 01:15:45.971
How could he always tell? He never knew or seemed to care what Dennis or Sandy were thinking. It was his mother's mind and 
Meg's that he probed with frightening accuracy. Was it because people were a little afraid of him that they whispered

01:15:56.044 --> 01:16:02.713
about the Murray's youngest child who was rumoured to be not quite bright? I've heard that clever people often have 
subnormal children. Meg had once overheard. The two boys seemed to be nice, regular children, but that unattractive

01:16:08.514 --> 01:16:14.319
girl and the baby boy certainly aren't all there. It was true that Charles Wallace Seldom spoke when anybody was around, 
so that many people thought he'd never learn to talk. And it was true that he hadn't talked at all until he was almost four.

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:31.215
Meg would turn white with fury when people looked at him and clucked, shaking their heads, sadly. Don't worry about 
Charles Wallace, Meg. Her father had once told her. Meg remembered it very clearly because it was shortly before he went

01:16:35.956 --> 01:16:38.959
away. There's nothing to matter with his mind. He just does things in his own way and in his own time. I don't want him to 
grow up to be dumb like me, Meg had said. Oh my darling, you're not dumb. Her father answered, you're like Charles

01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:52.332
Wallace. Your development has to go at its own pace. It just doesn't happen to be the usual pace. How do you know Meg had 
demanded? How do you know I'm not dumb? Is it just because you love me? I love you, but that's not what tells me. Mother and I

01:17:05.675 --> 01:17:07.758
have given you a number of tests, you know. Yes, that was true. Meg had realized that some of the games her parents played 
with her were tests of some kind, that there had been more for her and Charles Wallace than for the twins. IQ tests, you

01:17:18.355 --> 01:17:19.316
mean? Yes, some of them. Is my IQ okay? More than okay. What is it? That I'm not going to tell you, but it assures me that both 
you and Charles Wallace will be able to do pretty much whatever you like when you grow up to yourselves. You just wait till

01:17:33.503 --> 01:17:35.565
Charles Wallace starts to talk. You'll see how right he'd been.

01:17:40.912 --> 01:17:44.135
So, of course, the two children are more than very intelligent. They're super intelligent. There are, as you gather, 
two other siblings, twins who are nearly normal, and don't therefore figure in the story very much. The third

01:17:53.714 --> 01:17:57.079
participant in the adventure is, in fact, from another family. In fact, from an underprivileged family of 11 children, 
which we learn within the first dozen lines of dialogue after he appears. He's challenged in the woods by Meghan Charles

01:18:06.874 --> 01:18:11.481
Wallace going off to see Mrs. Watsett. And he's asked why he's there, and he answers, I just came to get away from my 
family. Charles Wallace nodded. What kind of family? They all have running noses. I'm third from the top of 11 kids. I'm a

01:18:25.146 --> 01:18:25.827
sport. At that, Charles Wallace grinned widely. So am I. I don't mean like in baseball, Calvin said. Neither do I. I mean 
like in biology, Calvin said suspiciously. And of course, Charles Wallace knows just what he's talking about. Now,

01:18:39.889 --> 01:18:50.586
Calvin, I think he's 14, his description of his family is runny nose, nothings, among whom he is a sport because he's 
bright. seems to me to be somewhat callow, but I accept it in reading the story because the boy's only 14 and since this

01:18:51.106 --> 01:19:14.937
book already presents itself as one in which family solidarity is emphasised, one assumes that his contempt for his own 
ordinary family and his admiration for the special Murray family will be straightened out sometime later in the story.

01:19:16.283 --> 01:19:24.218
But what happens immediately is that the highly intelligent special Murray family takes into its bosom and treats him 
like an orphan. The genius infant Charles Wallace invites him to dinner, and when Calvin denies, on account of the

01:19:25.092 --> 01:19:41.900
invitation not issuing from Charles Wallace's mother, who does, after all, scientist or no scientist have to do the 
cooking, Charles Wallace replies, oh, she'd be delighted. Mother's all right. She's not one of us, but she's all right.

01:19:46.187 --> 01:19:47.028
What about Meg? Meg has it tough, Charles Wallace said. She's not really one thing or the other. What do you mean, one of 
us, Meg demanded? What do you mean I'm not one thing or the other? Not now, Meg, Charles Wallace said. Slowly, I'll tell

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:02.333
you about it later.

01:20:03.334 --> 01:20:17.256
So, so the trio who are selected for the adventure consists of two male children who belong to a select group of geniuses 
and a girl who has it tough because she's neither clearly exceptional nor clearly ordinary. And what happens is, of

01:20:18.299 --> 01:20:22.383
course, that the girl becomes the heroine of the adventure. An adolescent love relationship develops between herself 
and the 14-year-old Calvin. The genius infant gets sucked in by the monster and has to be rescued along with the father.

01:20:34.393 --> 01:20:39.438
Note that he gets sucked in precisely because he's the most intelligent and most special of the trio. The girl manages to 
pull off the rescue of both father and then subsequently brother because out of all of them, father, Calvin, Charles

01:20:47.881 --> 01:20:52.066
Wallace and herself and the father. She is the one who has a gift which the monster has not got. She's told this, but she's 
not told what the gift is. And here's the climax. I bet you've guessed it already. When she has returned to the central

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:12.729
chamber where the giant exposed brain, which is it, has Charles Wallace imprisoned. There was a sudden sucking and she 
was within. It was as though the wind had been knocked out of her. She gasped for breath, for breath in her own rhythm, not

01:21:19.334 --> 01:21:23.725
the permeating pulsing of it. She could feel the inexorable beat within her body, controlling her heart, her lungs, but 
not herself. Not Meg, it didn't quite have her. She blinked her eyes rapidly and against the rhythm until the redness

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:37.927
before them cleared and she could see. There was the brain, there was it lying, pulsing and quivering on the days, soft 
and exposed and nauseating. Charles Wallace was crouched beside it. His eyes still slowly twirling, his jaw still

01:21:49.544 --> 01:21:58.337
slack as she'd seen him before, with the ticking as for it reiterating the revolting rhythm of it. As she saw him, it was 
again as though she had been punched in the stomach, but she had to realise afresh that she was seeing Charles, and yet it

01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:07.600
was not Charles at all. Where was Charles Wallace? Her own beloved Charles Wallace. What is it that I've got that it 
hasn't got? You have nothing that it hasn't got, Charles Wallace said proudly. How nice to have you back, dear sister.

01:22:21.055 --> 01:22:22.096
We've been waiting for you. We knew that Mrs. Watson would send you. She's our friend, you know. From a pouring moment Meg 
believed, and in that moment she felt her brain being gathered up into it. No, she screamed at the top of her lungs. No, you

01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:34.857
lie! For a moment she was free from its clutches again. As long as I can stay angry enough, it can't get me. Is that what I 
have that it doesn't have? Nonsense, Charles Wallace said. You have nothing that it doesn't have. You're lying, she

01:22:47.533 --> 01:22:53.080
replied, and she felt only anger towards this boy who was not Charles Wallace at all. No, it wasn't anger. It was 
loathing. It was hatred, sheer and unadulterated. And as she became lost in hatred, she also began to be lost in it. The

01:23:02.178 --> 01:23:04.581
red miasma swam before her eyes. Her stomach churned in its rhythm. Her body trembled with the strength of her hatred and 
the strength of it. With the last vestige of consciousness, she jerked her mind and body. Hate was nothing that it didn't

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:15.617
have. It knew all about hate. You're lying about that and you're lying about Mrs. Wotsit, she screamed. Mrs. Wotsit 
hates you, Charles Wallace said. And that was where it made its fatal mistake. For as Meg said automatically, Mrs.

01:23:27.793 --> 01:23:31.017
Wotsit loves me. That's what she told me, that she loves me. Suddenly she knew. She knew. Love. That was what she had that 
it didn't have. She had Mrs. Wotsit love and her fathers and her mothers. and the real Charles Wallace's love and the

01:23:45.136 --> 01:23:50.302
twins and aunties, and she had her love for them. And that, of course, is what she uses.

01:23:55.728 --> 01:24:05.900
So it's love, family love, which achieves the rescue, and that's what Meg has, that her male partners in adventure do 
not. They have brains, she has love. And in the final family reconciliation, Calvin is included as one of the elite

01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:18.359
Murray family, which now has everything. There are a number of points which I think are worth noting, but perhaps I 
should talk about them after I've outlined the character and theme of Pauline Clark's book, The Twelve Magini. The

01:24:31.998 --> 01:24:34.802
central character in this book is the young boy. Once again it's a young boy who has special gifts of intuition which make 
him the person for whom the toy soldiers come alive. Once again he's presented as intelligent but this time just

01:24:44.401 --> 01:24:49.933
ordinarily intelligent not a genius. Once again there's an older sister who shares the adventure Once again, what they 
have to offer is distinguished carefully. He is more intense in his reaction to the toy soldiers, more passionate. She

01:25:03.437 --> 01:25:06.402
is more careful, thoughtful and tender. And once again, there's also a 14-year-old boy involved. This time, as I said, a 
sibling. And this book, an English book, avoids sex completely. The older sibling is, in fact, the one who threatens the

01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:24.675
safety of the 12 and is an airing child. You know, the typical childhood airingness, meanness, money-grubbing, 
slightly bullying of younger siblings. The explanation of the soldiers coming alive that is offered is that the genius

01:25:34.265 --> 01:25:41.412
of the Brontes brought them to life. A metaphor for creativity, in fact, made actual and literal. But the children of the 
story, Max and Jane, are not geniuses. So why do the soldiers come to life for them? And the explanation is predictable

01:25:54.124 --> 01:25:56.147
again. And when Max finally reads the Bronte's Juvenilia with the invented history of the toy soldiers called the young 
men, he reflects. And the genie imagined them all so real, he thought to himself, that the young men, that's the

01:26:07.283 --> 01:26:14.613
soldier's name for themselves, still remember. They're still alive. Could this be what it was? and then he felt 
thinking of them in turn and which he loved best. He told Jane and his mother that nobody could love anything more than he

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:27.105
loved the 12s now. And this was true. He wondered if this was another reason why they were so lively because he loved them 
and they trusted him. And he saw it again, the power of love coupled with the creative imagination which comes into play.

01:26:44.753 --> 01:26:50.120
There is a somewhat religious cast to the Twelve and the Genius, which is also present in A Wrinkle in Time. In the Twelve 
and the Genius, a friendly parson is allowed to see the Twelve's triumphal re-entry into Harworth's parsonage. And the

01:26:59.612 --> 01:27:07.842
parson, Mr. Haweson, thought, I cannot believe it, and yet here they are before my eyes, such is the power of genius to 
make things alive. So do the creative genie echo their creator. And this is a chord which is also struck in a wrinkle in

01:27:12.142 --> 01:27:22.152
time when Mrs. Watsit, the comforter, explains that the children are not alone in their fight. And we're not alone, you 
know, children came, Mrs. Watson, the comforter, all through the universe it's being fought, all through the cosmos,

01:27:23.667 --> 01:27:33.426
and my, but it's a grand and exciting battle. I know it's hard for you to understand about size, how there's very little 
difference in the size of the tiniest microbe in the greatest galaxy. You think about that, you think about that, sorry,

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:49.124
and maybe it won't seem strange to you that some of our very best fighters have come right from your own planet. And it's a 
little planet, dears, out on the edge of a little galaxy. You can be proud that it's done so well. Who are our fighters

01:27:55.662 --> 01:27:57.785
being? Calvin asked. Oh, you must know them dear, Mrs. Watson said. Mrs. Who's spectacles shone out at them 
triumphantly, and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. Jesus, Charles Wallace said.

01:28:10.746 --> 01:28:11.928
Why, of course, Jesus. Of course, Mrs. Watson said. Go on, Charles Love, there were others. All your great artists, 
there have been lights for us to see by. Leonardo da Vinci, with Calvin's suggested tentatively, and Michelangelo, and

01:28:19.928 --> 01:28:29.359
Shakespeare, Charles Wallace called out, and Bach, and Pasteur, and Madame Curie, and Einstein. Now Calvin's voice 
rang with confidence, and Schweitzer, and Gandhi, and Buddha, and Beethoven, and Rembrandt, and St. Francis, and so

01:28:35.646 --> 01:28:40.211
on.

01:28:40.231 --> 01:28:49.041
The family background in the 12 and the genie is comfortable, intelligent, middle class, but it's much less important 
there than in wrinkled in time. And there is no, I'm glad to say, Cinderella-type rescue of a working-class child

01:28:49.477 --> 01:29:03.034
displaced out of its proper intelligence.

01:29:03.955 --> 01:29:06.919
A funny name, is all it is, that the soldiers give Max. It gradually exposes its other conventional meanings of genius, a 
very creative intelligence, and then the root sense which is related to generate and creating life. In fact, I have to

01:29:21.037 --> 01:29:27.683
say that although I consider both books good, I do consider the twelve and the genie better because it's a subtler book. I 
find it less offensive in its social attitudes and less partisan about the values it espouses. Madeleine Lengel places

01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:44.138
so much emphasis on the superiority of brains in the early part of the book that she has to make the apotheosis of the power 
of love very melodramatic in order to counterbalance the emphasis of the earlier book. Now, although you might think

01:29:51.235 --> 01:30:11.138
it's a large conclusion to draw from illustrations just from two books, I think that difference does arise from the fact 
that the science fiction writer writing for children is aware that there is an alternative adult audience somewhere

01:29:51.235 --> 01:30:11.138
else for science fiction and therefore is much more inclined to oversimplify and overdramatize when writing for 
children than the writer of fantasy, historical fantasy, who has no real alternative. Thanks for listening.

01:30:41.442 --> 01:30:42.989
Yeah. I remember when I was, you know, you had to come home with that. I thought it was very bad stuff. I didn't get past all 
the few pages. What I really liked, it was Andrej Norsen and Robert Ackermann. Yes, quite. Yes, quite. I happened, I was

01:31:00.895 --> 01:31:04.779
born in Red Two or Three Beach in their books, and I thought they were good. The reason I chose the Madeline Lengel book was 
because of the exact parallel in time and treatment and things like that. I don't think I chose it as a prejudice choice.

01:31:15.329 --> 01:31:17.912
Now, let me see. Yes, all I can say is that I do think the Doctor Northman and Hannah and Hannah are quite good, but I've only 
read one or two of each of their books. What are the reviews on Imagine Faraway? Yeah, I can't really answer that with much

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:44.302
immediate knowledge either, because I've never read it since I was a kid. I think, I remember rightly, People do seem to 
think that that's Enid Biden's best writing. That's where she wrote the best. What people object to is largely the

01:31:57.858 --> 01:32:09.592
limited vocabulary of her books and the somewhat unhappy social attitudes that some of them present. Do you think not 
unlike the social attitudes of the Marilyn Engel book, actually, and that you find all over children's fiction?

01:32:18.862 --> 01:32:21.706
even if I can seem to have less and less to redeem her. The point is that she wasn't sort of banned. She just sort of fell off 
the bottom of the list where librarians have only a certain amount of money to buy books each year where the standard of

01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:36.687
children's literature has been rising over the last 20 years. She has simply gone down in merit as well as everything 
else because she's been surpassed that film. But apart from not buying new things, they also grabbed the old stuff,

01:32:44.266 --> 01:32:48.570
right? They said it wasn't going to be replaced, yeah. I said they didn't take it out of the show. No, no, but you know, as 
books wear out, they weren't replaced, yeah. You compared England flight and insurance literature, being popular,

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:07.347
but not good because of that. probably

01:33:08.592 --> 01:33:36.203
because children's libraries perhaps have less funds you know that the collection is will be smaller you'll find in the 
children's library than in adult library and granted that they have small funds they feel that they have to be careful in

01:33:36.183 --> 01:33:38.767
their choosing. But it's also the fact that children's librarians feel, you know, the ones that I've talked to feel that 
they have an important responsibility in selecting books for children, you know, that you can in fact influence

01:33:39.247 --> 01:33:55.830
children's tastes by the range of what is available to them. And, you know, I think one would have to agree a child who 
never gets near, you know, any great selection of books as being deprived in some way, I agree,

01:34:05.377 --> 01:34:15.434
and yet I think that if you take out the children's libraries and what children like, you're going to be able to work with 
them. Oh yes, that would certainly be true if you use that as a criterion for putting things out. I mean, it doesn't work

01:34:22.105 --> 01:34:23.287
the other way. A book being popular doesn't mean that it's good, but it doesn't mean that it's bad either. And to hear some 
of the elitist critics talk, you would think that it did. And that's strongly suggested by Henry. James's attitude in

01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:46.643
that essay, The Future of the Novel, he seemed absolutely dismayed that the novel was galloping so in popularity. He 
thought that simply being popular would reduce its chances of being art. Now, we don't call that obviously. Oh, I think

01:34:58.837 --> 01:35:09.396
that there's nothing attaching to the form of pictures with balloons and so on that makes it good, bad, or indifferent. I 
presume they have exactly the same potentiality for being good, bad, and indifferent comics as wholly text books have

01:35:09.636 --> 01:35:21.317
of being good, bad, and indifferent.

01:35:24.605 --> 01:35:41.247
a lot

01:35:24.605 --> 01:35:41.247
of the funny things that people say when they're talking about children's books and children's reading I have arisen 
out of the circumstances that I've been talking about. That is, they've been forced into an almost indefensible

01:35:45.568 --> 01:35:50.533
position. That and the very fact that they feel very proper responsibility may make them more anxious about this or that 
or the other being good for children.

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:09.090
Wouldn't it be right in thinking of the general Australian writers of children's books? are doing better in 
satisfaction before you were not really too happy about how well you were doing that. They're doing jolly well, as

01:36:22.396 --> 01:36:30.572
you're probably thinking of the fact that I haven't settled on the Carnegie Prize last year.

01:36:31.598 --> 01:36:36.784
that the peculiar situation with children's books is that it is so very international. The translation activity, for 
instance, in children's books is much, much higher than it is in adult novels of any kind. And it's quite interesting to

01:36:46.155 --> 01:36:50.240
speculate about that. I'm not quite sure why it comes about. It may be because children's books aren't likely to be 
offensive in any way or at all. I don't really know but in fact children's books travel. And of course the well-meaning

01:37:02.417 --> 01:37:12.851
people who promote children's books are also in favour of other general good ideas like international understanding. 
So they want kids to read books about how children live in other countries and things like this. All those sorts of

01:37:18.379 --> 01:37:20.742
factors might contribute. Well,

01:37:21.582 --> 01:37:40.651
I actually don't like the whole definition of a genre. I think somebody in the panel before was wondering if what we might 
gain from going for breaking down the boundaries, breaking down the notion that we have a specific genre. I'm very much

01:37:53.812 --> 01:37:56.716
in favour of that as far as children's books are concerned. I

01:37:56.736 --> 01:38:11.080
was just thinking, you

01:37:56.736 --> 01:38:11.080
know, because of the babbles on the wall of the city, of the towers on the edge, ends on the catapult. have been 
recommended by adults and children. Oh, I see. Yeah. Nothing on the grid. No, quite. And you see this withholding from

01:38:21.894 --> 01:38:31.327
children of horrific material, I think, has only produced a massive underground in horrific material. You know,

01:38:32.188 --> 01:38:37.576
listen to children's playground rhymes. You wouldn't get anything more horrific than some of them.

01:38:46.362 --> 01:39:06.565
What we were making about the provisional librarians setting themselves up to form the funding taste for all the places 
of children could go too far. in seeking to do this, I know you can't go completely in the other direction and allow the

01:39:08.603 --> 01:39:18.756
level of pacifism to find itself. And as professionals, just follow the popular trend to start to be a balance, 
particularly with the children's development agenda. I think that this is virtually the reason such as ours. I've

01:39:37.202 --> 01:39:44.196
noticed that in over a decade of contact with a certain family, there is a continuous tension between those people that 
read what the literati call badly written books which are very popular and which cater to a low level of public taste and

01:39:44.682 --> 01:40:06.488
books which they consider works of by artistic standard in which the people who enjoy the more popular and badly written 
stuff find jolly hard to read. And the fact that the literati discusses amongst themselves as a kind and elitist group in

01:40:16.670 --> 01:40:23.886
the family. I see. One thing I've noticed in recent years is that the tendency for the two groups to more or less come 
together is the gradual increase in the place. And the gradual appreciation of qualities in the bad books that are far

01:40:36.281 --> 01:40:51.460
the way around here, the qualities that make them good, the spiritual lens for the series, the moral world. In fact, 
thank you Mr. Constance. Yes, there's obviously a private dispute in there somewhere but I think that A cult, and I don't

01:41:02.746 --> 01:41:23.187
mean that as a pejorative word, is just what you get, like you know that the Tolkien has a massive sort of fairly private 
following, is just what you get when something is excluded from proper recognition and people feel that it ought to be

01:41:02.746 --> 01:41:23.187
talked about.

01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:27.211
Sorry? Yeah. But I would like such groups not to turn their back on the possibility that what they actually want is 
critical recognition for the genre, which once achieved, they can then dissolve themselves. I mean, at least in a sense

01:41:46.579 --> 01:41:52.429
you can, that is to regard yourself as a pressure group.

01:41:54.593 --> 01:42:04.950
You see, although I have started up a special course at Lenders called Children's Literature, and that amounts to 
acknowledging that it is separate, I've done that because it's the only way I could get to teach it in a university at all.

01:42:06.692 --> 01:42:20.044
What I hope in time is that I will be able to persuade my colleagues to consider books like Alice in Wonderland when 
they're making up 19th century novel courses, you see. And if that happens, then my course can go away because

01:42:20.345 --> 01:42:29.073
children's literature will have its proper place. And I hope that you would feel the same about science fiction. I was 
told

01:42:34.512 --> 01:42:54.208
by my mum that I spent it to a school board and it had too much social comfort. We all

01:42:54.374 --> 01:43:08.328
know children aren't interested in politics. You should examine again the politics of any school.

01:43:15.835 --> 01:43:20.500
I think those sorts of stereotypes are very limiting and harmful.

01:43:26.386 --> 01:43:38.122
I wanted to speak before, but I don't know

01:43:26.386 --> 01:43:38.122
where to interview. Friends like them. I was very interested in the way we referred to the fact that the fantasy writer 
doesn't have an athlete like the science fiction writer and turns to children's fantasy. I also think there's another

01:43:49.778 --> 01:43:55.566
aspect here that there are some science fiction writers to write to children's books, but choose to write in fantasy 
when they write to the children, as you know that we do. She writes an excellent science fiction and speaking of herself

01:44:03.615 --> 01:44:21.756
as a writer, when I do write to children, I would really prefer to write in fantasy because I want you to strip away the 
pseudo-philosophical pretensions of science fiction. the mind game and all that goes with it and bring it down to

01:44:21.736 --> 01:44:29.788
children's fiction itself. It's very restrictive. I see. To try and do science fiction at a lower level, you think, is 
not really on. Because once the ideas have to lose their complexity, they lose their interest. Yes, quite. And I think

01:44:46.434 --> 01:44:50.460
that's why there is not as much good science fiction. Yes, quite. I think there are some ideas which are, at the same time, 
simple and mind-boggling. The book that I recommended, Highly the Mousson, His Child, is very much concerned with the

01:45:01.596 --> 01:45:08.306
idea of infinity. It's a beautiful book, really marvellous. Do you think we've got a right to counter-casual 
children's literature? I'm afraid maybe that that's a stupid name because you obviously read it. I like the German

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:36.609
language. It's more or less just plain fancy literature. Oh, no, that's what I was talking about today, but I am 
interested in old books that come out with a puffin on its cover or a dragon on, you know. In fact, that's how it happens

01:45:51.718 --> 01:45:52.980
often. People submit a manuscript into their surprise to get a letter saying it's been referred to the children's 
editor. What are the issues with textbooks? There were two of them in America. That's right. That's right, yeah. And

01:46:08.043 --> 01:46:09.386
it's gone the other way too. There are some, I think there was one prize winning book, I think by Rue Mcgarden recently, 
that appeared as an adult novel in America, and as a children's book in England. It shows how often. But it goes the other

01:46:21.751 --> 01:46:39.979
way too, right?

01:46:39.959 --> 01:46:41.461
Well, there probably were, you see. It's just a publicly wondrous meeting, how much complexity children enjoy.

01:46:58.808 --> 01:47:02.873
I was going to ask you about talking down. Would you imagine that somebody who's been writing books for adults and 
consciously tries to write them for a child probably does what you're suggesting, which is underage, in terms of

01:47:03.333 --> 01:47:18.171
complexity? Yeah, quite so. I would swear to that. I actually invite the students in my course who are third and fourth 
year students to write stories, if they want to, children stories for their assignments.

01:47:45.704 --> 01:48:07.375
Yeah, I think that the degree of self-consciousness is... Might be

01:47:45.704 --> 01:48:07.375
going across.

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:14.526
Yeah, because it's easy to, you know, for an established author to run a sort of fairly high-minded line like C.S. Lewis 
does, you know, he says, oh, what happens is you want to write a book, you write it, and you find that it's come out a

01:48:14.566 --> 01:48:22.654
children's book, you know. I think that's a bit rubbishy, actually, because at least the Narnia books are among the most 
talking-down books that I know. And I mean, I think they're very good, but they're also extremely patronizing. The

01:48:34.645 --> 01:48:36.467
children don't mind it. I carefully

01:48:37.882 --> 01:49:04.530
avoided actually drawing any lines because I wouldn't know how to do it myself.

01:49:06.265 --> 01:49:18.970
Well, if there are a lot of better questions, I'm really going to end this

01:49:06.265 --> 01:49:18.970
here. Thank you for a very interesting talk.

01:49:32.725 --> 01:49:54.112
All in all,

01:49:32.725 --> 01:49:54.112
I was delighted to see that due to the strain and the work that you've been doing over the program, I just hope that that's 
the part of the way. Most unfortunately, that's what we would do. Definitely. I'm not sure. A lot. So I appreciate it,

01:49:57.996 --> 01:49:58.577
Adelaide. And thank you for your credit. And all the rest of your attention. Unfortunately,

01:50:02.054 --> 01:50:12.971
unfortunately, the show must go on and it must remain now contributed to its memory. So, that's what we're going to do. 
I'm going to play the first thing.

01:50:44.410 --> 01:50:56.002
Commonly

01:50:44.410 --> 01:50:56.002
experienced by general practitioners in the finance department. Depends on the diet of someone.

01:51:04.792 --> 01:51:07.735
But, as a legal researcher, I must find out.

01:51:13.418 --> 01:51:20.607
the supernatural vampire, which you must agree has such little creed, it's quite impossible. These are things that 
myth and legend grossly distorted by, oh yes, first life tonight. Lights, please, spots out. Now, this is what you might

01:51:29.998 --> 01:51:34.543
call a traditional vampire. I'm glad to be here. Pennsylvania needs you.

01:51:42.832 --> 01:51:44.013
Now focus too. Anyway, there you are. Typical cave. The work for teeth. A definitely nasty piece of work, but 
unfortunately the facts have been distorted in time. Ah, but the answer's come clearer with you apply a little medical

01:51:58.127 --> 01:52:02.651
science to the man. Traditionally, man fires spend very evil lives, commit suicide, or even than they were known to. And 
right in the day, with an actual fact, medical science proved slightly otherwise. Vampirin, obviously a disease,

01:52:18.678 --> 01:52:24.885
transmitted more than a million months of population. In fact, it won't be described as an entire process. The 
vampire's course of deceit begins with a bit of it. And then the first symptoms had it off the set. He dies. He's not quite

01:52:42.387 --> 01:52:44.809
such a man, please. One may ask, why does the man die when, in fact, he apparently rose from the dead beginning? Now, it's 
as simple as he doesn't die. Now, it's your fact that for disease, obviously the metabolic process is quite severely. He

01:52:58.264 --> 01:53:06.973
tends to go into a comatose state, a deep comatose state, sufficient to be called to surrender animation. The Russians 
prefer to call such a state anabiosis, virtually without life in the Greek. Other terms are hyperbiosis or unlife. And

01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:21.186
the one I prefer is cryptobiosis, signal life. Because in fact, while apparently dead, it's alive. Now, the person in 
the cryptobiosis state, what does one do with it? So you put it on the turn, or a crypt, or in the grave. Now, the second

01:53:34.665 --> 01:53:37.129
symptoms have their onset. Basically, the Cumberdough State is not a permanent one. The person thinks the way back. 
Now,

01:53:43.674 --> 01:53:54.325
if a person wakes up from apparently a dead state and they've been buried, they're not going to get very far. Unless of 
course, as the one who lived, they come from the upper strata of society, where in fact they're not buried in the ground,

01:53:54.805 --> 01:54:04.135
but buried in tombs or crypts. They find the buried and they get out of here. So much with blue blood. Now, the other 
interesting features of this disease is it's not a simple disease. One would say it's like radiation, as it obviously

01:54:17.116 --> 01:54:19.559
is. We're going to see the central nervous system side effects. Psychotic mania.

01:54:28.272 --> 01:54:32.698
This is not quite a traditional vampire, but, you know, it's quite a certain group. You have psychosis coming from the 
effects on the nervous system. The other mechanism is by a rabdo type virus. which pursues the cause, very well pursuant

01:54:43.175 --> 01:54:46.840
to it. It moves into the liver and attacks one of the RNA or DNA cofactors. Preferably the liver because none of that goes 
by chemical in the liver. You can say anything about it. So you have these two diseases that work in concert that produce a

01:54:57.553 --> 01:55:05.082
single coherent system of symptoms.

01:55:07.508 --> 01:55:14.957
Now, a lot of the side effects of anything is, well, obviously the central nervous effects are quite severe. 
Traditionally, vampires are quelled by the power of the cross. Obviously, monsters. But, if you think about it, a

01:55:22.387 --> 01:55:27.593
devil's central nervous system is bound to, what do you think? So, you would get things like intense morbid phobias of 
religious symbols. So, fear of the cross. Possibly also fear of consecrated ground. Are we waiting for this?

01:55:44.528 --> 01:55:48.033
Additionally, as for things like running water, obviously a bit. Once, of course, they're disorientated so severely 
they can't swim. Other side effects are quite interesting. The vampire, because he spends so much time in a

01:55:55.603 --> 01:56:02.092
crypto-biotics state, has his life span extended quite considerably. So in fact, you get the apparent longevity of the 
vampire. And

01:56:06.875 --> 01:56:15.828
the other interesting effects is that the vampire is produced, is brought into the state of actual hysterical 
strength. Hysterical strength is one of the most curious cases where the attainment of mouse-wives who involved in the

01:56:16.209 --> 01:56:28.146
color accident and had a child trapped underneath the smarged car are quite capable of picking up and moving a car. It 
usually weighs about a tonne. Normally they end up with a lot of problems before it's ended up with butts. These

01:56:36.743 --> 01:56:40.067
creatures live in a state of perpetual hysterical strength. Their metabolic states are greatly enhanced, so they're 
much more biologically efficient. And being much more biologically efficient, they become very difficult to kill.

01:56:50.097 --> 01:56:51.759
The mere simple wounds they've been killed. Ordinary people are effectual. It takes very massive wounds to destroy the 
environment. Therefore, decapitation is staking the heart. Because the disease is so pernicious, viruses will last

01:57:03.322 --> 01:57:12.937
for a long time, the only way to get rid of a vampire is to consume the power of that fire. The poor peasant vampires are 
presumably quite contained in very, you know, the second and the third side please. This tends to ram the point over a

01:57:19.908 --> 01:57:24.175
little too hard, I think. It does produce the effect of massive wounding. Um, what do you about the focus on that 
something? I'm using

01:57:37.419 --> 01:57:41.266
your hand now. Oh yes, that's good. That prism we can now see just simply. Oh yes, the others is interesting, but there are 
three theories about why they're going to pop up. One is the co-pact of fear which I mentioned. which is very nice because

01:57:52.495 --> 01:57:59.624
it explains why one is taking the oil, taking it for the matter. The situation is that what happens when blood is in the 
stomach is different because there's so many enzymes that act as an axis and the blood is simply congealed. So why do they

01:58:07.855 --> 01:58:09.477
leave blood? The co-fact is a simple molecule easily taken in The other one is the hemolytic fear. This one assumes that 
the blood can be cut in out of the hemolytic canal, which is injected all over it. The third one is super psychological

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:27.204
again. Blood has got so many coronations in life. The person who finds that he periodically dies, he obviously needs 
more life. So how do we go out and draw blood? The adaptions of being a vampire are quite severe. Many people can't stand

01:58:44.605 --> 01:58:49.871
this training. The ones in the base of that could survive longer. Also, a simple adaption to survive. This is the 
director, regional anti-vampire control. We're not law enforcement activities. Attack and destroy the vampire now.

01:59:17.579 --> 01:59:42.040
So

01:59:17.579 --> 01:59:42.040
much

01:59:17.579 --> 01:59:42.040
for psychology.

01:59:44.082 --> 01:59:46.084
Where's our restaurant?

01:59:48.106 --> 01:59:55.374
Strike, but remember, only a massively destructive ruin can destroy a man. Stay and live. Watch out for the demonic

01:59:57.637 --> 02:00:17.320
strength

01:59:57.637 --> 02:00:17.320
of the man.

02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:22.742
Right, next slide, please.

02:00:25.906 --> 02:00:31.935
This is where we really

02:00:25.906 --> 02:00:31.935
go off the ground. Next slide, please. This is moving up the date. Next slide. Protections and things to come. 
Obviously, the human future lies in space. This is a viewing next slide, please.

02:00:53.075 --> 02:01:04.458
Yes, moving right

02:00:53.075 --> 02:01:04.458
along, hollow type module. Next

02:01:04.999 --> 02:01:09.227
please. You've got to bang through all these clothes quickly. Just keep banging away. Oh, I love that. Ah, the good old 
moon. A nice dead wall. Brutal activity going on. A few odd things about it, though. But for the mass cons, isn't it? A nice

02:01:24.864 --> 02:01:25.465
wall. A little different. Change of scenery. Continue working. Ah, this is what we hope to be doing. Well, if you'd like 
to try it. Continue.

02:01:37.642 --> 02:01:39.585
Now, this is moving out a little further. It's a new real estate. I think it's a cool production. Not as far as project 
demos, of course. American stuff, NASA. A couple of loads of Mars. Please continue. Same again, going down. Actually,

02:01:55.048 --> 02:01:55.969
that's a Viking. I think

02:01:55.989 --> 02:02:02.839
I'm on a machine, I think.

02:02:09.046 --> 02:02:10.667
abstract out as bones or not. This of course is Phobos, the moon, planets Mars. Interesting planet, very low pressure, 
lots and lots of dust, a lot of the weather is controlled by energy getting into that dust. Quite interesting stuff.

02:02:25.661 --> 02:02:28.964
That's why it rises, absorbs heat energy, jumps about the place. Continue.

02:02:32.328 --> 02:02:32.628
A blank. Any old common old garden asteroid being visited by earthlings. Continue.

02:02:42.408 --> 02:02:43.061
Ah, yes. Venus. Very, very good if we'd done this one. Not quite as it would look, but, uh, optically that is. Uh, this 
would probably be completely blacked out. Um, one more thing, pointy thing, like, finger. Lightning would do it. If you

02:02:58.753 --> 02:03:03.660
assume this was taken in infrared, this has got a surface temperature around one moment. About 700 degrees cold, and 
that'd be about 450 degrees, say, uh, centigrade. Quite warm. Atmospheric pressure, how to guess, is about 60

02:03:10.710 --> 02:03:14.355
atmospheres. A lot of difficulties. A yank classified this, we classified it as pyrolysis, which means hot and deep. 
Always hot and deep. That must be like plastic or interesting stuff, optically being quite wild. Because of any light

02:03:31.210 --> 02:03:56.794
that we've been through quite some peculiar rain was in fact, uh, important you're going to see, but if you imagine a 
surface of a spear like a ball and a light ray coming down, instead of going straight down to the surface as would a normal

02:03:31.210 --> 02:03:56.794
light ray in an atmosphere like ours, it would be quite severely instead of landing at the point where it came straight in 
at, it would land somewhere on the other side, sort of to a view point, except it wouldn't make it. Go out and then that is

02:03:56.814 --> 02:03:59.496
the side. If anything, we're living in a planet like that, I'd have to use a sonar type system, as would things like 
Dolphin Oceanic, which is, continue please.

02:04:10.233 --> 02:04:14.219
That one's going to come first, that's Venus all the way, please continue. Jump it up, continue. This is how the solar 
system sat in, this one came out beautifully. How's focus going on the menu? Yeah, it is, isn't it? Okay, time on. Stacked

02:04:27.202 --> 02:04:30.269
down again, on Titan, setting off seismic charges. Absolutely beautiful. Here we come from on my projection, not to 
worry. I sat down again, that looked better. Nice stuff. Good to know. Seventh planet of the solar system. This planet

02:04:40.190 --> 02:04:42.696
has had a bad deal from science fiction. There are no great science fiction stories throughout Uranus. Continue. 
Neptune's had a better deal. It's mentioned in a couple. Actually, that's why Uranus is a better deal. It's got about

02:04:55.898 --> 02:04:57.020
five moons. I've all got beautiful Latin names. Whereas Neptune's got two tritons and a myriad. Continue. This is where 
we get out into the world. Uh, so to speak. Fact. Stars continue with you. Just hammer away. This is where science fiction

02:05:15.267 --> 02:05:17.170
is going to go. Oh, no. Uh, some of these are quite... That is North America, would you believe? No. It is. I shall 
demonstrate if I had a long pointy thing, which I don't. Oh, you... What do you believe is the Gulf of Mexico, if you could

02:05:27.927 --> 02:05:34.037
say so? No, I don't. Downes are everywhere, but not so worried. Continue, please. Some of these are incredibly 
beautiful. The focus is, that's the horse head nebula. A horse head. Continue. Andromeda, of course. Anyone can

02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:55.462
recognize the andromeda glance. It's only one and a half million light years away. So it's a long walk. This is called the 
dumbbell nebula in Volpeka. Dumb bells. Continue. That is the crap they've gone. Absolutely swishable piece of work.

02:06:13.103 --> 02:06:16.408
It keeps a lot of boffins busy because it's got all sorts of nice things going on in there. Lots of hot gas. A pulsar in there 
which is probably a neutron star. I haven't written an essay on it earlier this year, I should know. These are stars,

02:06:24.301 --> 02:06:26.103
except that we've got square things. Continue. Another galaxy. Very sweet. Continue. I

02:06:31.964 --> 02:06:37.232
would say Smudgey Starfleet. That'd be... That's a Nebula. Nebula's gas. Gasiest bodies filled with... This is called 
the Rosetta Nebula in Manosaurus. It's an absolutely beautiful figure. It was in focus. It's really small. Continue,

02:06:52.355 --> 02:06:53.477
please. Uh, not a typical nebula, as you might find anywhere in the universe. Ah, oh, whatever. Now this, this is the 
plight of the seven sisters, which if you get a clear enough night you can see twenty-one. These are blue stars, they're

02:07:09.522 --> 02:07:16.491
quite hot, they've only got a life expectancy of mere few million years, so they'll blow out beautifully in the night 
quite soon. If you hang around long enough you'll see them go. Right, that's also incredibly beautiful in focus.

02:07:22.419 --> 02:07:25.082
Another typical galaxy, galaxies are quite interesting. It looks very much like you'd have in life anywhere in in the 
universe, you have to have galaxies. So if you move to another universe somewhere, and it hasn't got galaxies, your

02:07:32.024 --> 02:07:39.154
chance of finding any life there are pretty miserable. Especially intelligent life. There's a beautiful paper, a 
scientific paper, mind you. It's quite technical. It proves that the universe is like what we see because we happen to be

02:07:44.923 --> 02:07:49.529
here. Because we live in a universe that's got galaxies, and it's isotopically distributed. It means that it happens to 
be intelligently in such a universe who can look out and say, huh, why are we here? And the answer is because we're in a

02:08:02.130 --> 02:08:07.781
universe that's us, traumically distributed, and it's got galaxies. That's the answer, kids. And I published a paper 
out of it, too. Bloody. Anyway, continue, please. This is a nice quick trip. Oh, right. I mean, yes. That's something

02:08:19.472 --> 02:08:20.815
which I can't remember. Timmy Slott. Continue, please. Ah, now we're really ruining the fight alone. This is a man going 
on a long slay trip. Would you believe it? Continue. He's got some men. Actually, this is, I think, literally. It's one of

02:08:37.713 --> 02:08:39.235
the interesting ones. A blue-white dwarf star and a large red giant. No theoretical reason to not wash your system 
light. Very funny. That one is either zeta-alguri or zeta-canstripe. It's alguri, remember? Continue. This is a

02:08:54.875 --> 02:08:55.616
squish. This is a hypothetical planet that is around a star that has gone nova. and in fact the bright bit is the number and 
the black chamber red stuff is the planetary nebula formant. This planet would be hypothetically about the position of

02:09:07.401 --> 02:09:11.517
our planet Pluto in our solar system. Continue. Now this, of course, is beta-wire relying on its side. These slides were 
dropped earlier in the evening, and the great changes are going to be missing, and it's been a bit difficult putting them

02:09:18.309 --> 02:09:28.842
all together again in a hurry. Beta-wire is a nice binary star. It's sufficiently close for there to be an exchange of 
gases. between the two stars, and because this tends to spin out, you have to spin because they're turning on one

02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:44.202
another, and you get this spiral coming out. It must be a really fabulous sight. Pity is, present theory says there's not 
much chance of them being planets, but then again, we might not take the present theories yet. Continue.

02:09:57.220 --> 02:09:58.883
Now this is zeta cancerite. Obviously, a rather miserable place. Continue.

02:10:07.570 --> 02:10:09.254
Ah, that's where they went. That's Mercury lying on the side. That is a Mercury mountain. That is a solar sun. And that is a 
Mercury plane. Continue. Ah, yes. Now this one is interesting because this is one of your common organic hypothetical

02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:27.092
planets going around for Centauri. This one is a real pity about the focus because, very fascinatingly enough, there is 
a constellation up here, that constellation, which we see in our skies and call Cassiopeia. In fact, On the planet going

02:10:41.135 --> 02:10:46.665
around Alpha Centauri, the stars will be very much as we see them, in the constellations. Except in this case, there is a 
seventh star. It's our sun. People suggested that this constellation, as seen from the Centauri planets, should be

02:10:49.870 --> 02:10:56.743
called the switchblade. Actually, Stephen Dole called that. Let's check away, if you want to call that. Probably the 
Vicious America, which he is. The Vicious Barclay is America. Continue. It gets even groovy as we go along. Yes. Here is

02:11:08.692 --> 02:11:10.153
one of your common old guys. Planets with intelligent life. It's not one of ours. Because a Brit painted this damn thing, 
you've got a Jottelbank type telescope, and you have an alien spacecraft taking off. Actually, there's an alien city

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:24.430
and things down here, too. Ha-ha, of course. A PMG tower, GPO type tower, London. Hmm. How much imaginations are we 
going? Continue. Ah, now we can get on extra-terrestrial life. That is a sort of primordial depiction of

02:11:39.516 --> 02:11:44.684
extra-terrestrial life. Didn't you, man, the suspects look beautiful. Ah, that looks almost too focused. That is like 
a galaxy as seen from a planet. Don't run a star along with Hulk from the galaxy, as one can guess. You have your great,

02:11:58.587 --> 02:12:02.914
ruddy, great galaxy here, and these things here are the other stars. Perhaps one would say a globular cluster moving 
outside the galaxy. Of course, there's a pretty high velocity start. This means they travel a couple hundred

02:12:11.673 --> 02:12:18.230
kilometers per second that are moving out of the galaxy, so they might have moved out and evolved life. Continue. Now, 
this is getting really aiding and aiding in life. This is a planet where there's great masses of carbon tetrachloride.

02:12:29.610 --> 02:12:32.174
That's a glob of carbon tetrachloride going up, or an alien. There's more gobs of carbon tetrachloride than an alien. A 
moon on some description. And, of course, obviously, as you've all guessed by now, this is a star inside probably a glob,

02:12:38.123 --> 02:12:44.373
a globular cluster, like that. Inside globular clusters, stars are sufficiently close to you within white months of 
one another. which means that if there are any civilizations out there, they would have a great chance to get around and

02:12:50.009 --> 02:12:59.363
form galactic empires. Because it would be quite easy to build interstellar space systems that can get out there. It 
will start as only a few light months away as opposed to light years. The only trouble is, the good guesses are, bombular

02:13:11.339 --> 02:13:19.175
clusters are old, which means they didn't have the heavy elements that we've got. That's to say, elements heavy in iron, 
uranium, cobalt, nickel. They probably couldn't form a machine civilization since we could. But they might struggle

02:13:27.793 --> 02:13:31.761
along with plastics and there is a lot of things you can do with biology. You can put rockers to go on. Yes, I would. If you 
can guess this one, you're good biologists. They'll go off with not so much a bang, but a... other musiating sound.

02:13:42.191 --> 02:13:44.433
Continue. Ah, yes. More extraterrestrial life. I guess. The next one, please. Oh, wrong one. These are typical pieces 
of extraterrestrial life. One of your typical Niven puppeteers. The properties are quite interesting. I thought they

02:14:02.271 --> 02:14:08.218
seemed to be quite acceptable form of alien life, except there are some nasty things about them from a biological point 
of view. I mean, apart from the fact that you've got these eyes on the end of these arms. The idea of a mouth as an organ

02:14:14.045 --> 02:14:17.209
manipulation is very good. I must grant the difference showing the incredible, the good originality in doing that. The 
three legs are a real foul up though. There are other problems involved. Basically, reproduction. Niven is very coy

02:14:32.782 --> 02:14:35.825
about the reproduction of puppeteers. And if you try to work out how they do it, it's no wonder he's so coy about it. He 
implies that they are females of the species of a non-sentient. Actually, I wonder about Larry Niven because they're

02:14:46.656 --> 02:14:50.820
chisindy. or zinty as one might say. Presumably it's supposed to pronounce the K but unfortunately because he used a 
letter like K which is silenced in a lot of uses, I tend to suppress his K. So I say zinty. Actually there is a CZ sound in some

02:15:04.675 --> 02:15:14.445
of the European languages which would be pronounced Cha, which would be pronounced Chinty, or if you accent Dutch and 
pull a ka, it becomes Kinty. So much for Larry Niven. We're going to rip some great chunks out of him later on. But anyway,

02:15:20.353 --> 02:15:22.556
as I said, oh yes, non-sentient. Because obviously the brain must get in the way if you've got to have a womb in there 
somewhere, so they've got to be non-sentient. Anyway, non-sentient female sex, that sounds suspicious to me.

02:15:32.168 --> 02:15:33.370
Obviously a hang-up somewhere. Continue. This is where they go off. Crazy cells, folks. Get out of the way, will you? 
Next slide, please. You're kidding, of course. Now I'm singing the song. This to give you some irritation is a mammal.

02:15:57.346 --> 02:16:03.214
You're, of course, sniggering it for the wrong reasons, because, biologically speaking, mammals I'm all equipped 
with these. Well, gentlemen, try to look down there best and check on them. In actual fact, mammals aren't mammals, not

02:16:11.524 --> 02:16:16.128
because they've got boobs, but because they've got hair. See? We can't see that slide. Now, interestingly

02:16:20.252 --> 02:16:29.721
enough, there's no biological reason why you couldn't have a species. In fact, when the males didn't have mammary 
glands, And in fact, looking at what happens at the pre-cellular level, where you can, in fact, do some interesting

02:16:32.303 --> 02:16:45.302
evolutionary experimental work on raw biochemical, which has been done, I mean, this is the first time you're going to 
hear it, folks. I mean, you know, John Poitzner said last night on television that science fiction was only 30 years

02:16:46.384 --> 02:16:55.257
behind science, behind everything you catch up. One could have memory miles. Continue, please. Thanks for the memory. 
This is one of your other biologically interesting things. The ancients in their way tended to mug up these creatures.

02:17:10.255 --> 02:17:13.759
Like, do you want antroops, so to say, all antroops? In other words, a bird man. A man with wings who flies. Very unsound. 
unstable. But we also do a sort of thing to, ah yes, spin your birds. It was once pointed out to me that in the Edgar Wright

02:17:24.833 --> 02:17:31.602
horror story, the Martians must all be reptiles when they were reproduced by eggs. Therefore, there's no need for the 
birds to have boobs. So, all those busty birds, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. In fact, they're a fake. Oh, my

02:17:43.557 --> 02:17:44.258
God. Edgar Rice Burroughs' imagination was working overtime for the wrong reasons.

02:17:53.131 --> 02:17:54.613
Continue. Now, this is beautiful. Now, everyone knows that science fiction writes his own science fiction. What they 
don't realise is that science writes his own science fiction too. Now, this is what one would call a communal garden.

02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:19.368
This is your Photon rocket work on a simple principle that you have a really great type of light down here somewhere and 
you square out lots of light and it moves forward in the opposite direction. A typically spot by there. Next slide

02:18:20.792 --> 02:18:22.095
please. A technical diagram on Aepoponics, which the numbers haven't come out yet. Now this... Ooh, bloody hell.

02:18:34.792 --> 02:18:37.475
This is a reflective dish. Engines... Oh, bugger us. There's a little shuttle rocket. Life support unit up there 
somewhere, and a long thin thing for supporting it all. Now the photo on rocket is a nice idea. Anyone can look at the

02:18:52.921 --> 02:19:01.799
calculations and they can show you that a photo on rocket will get very close to the velocity while therefore it won't 
take advantage of all the little ballistic effects like time dilation. The fact that the rocket gets shorter, actually

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:05.406
that's why. Because it means you can invent problems for physics students which say, how can you get a parachute through 
a pair of barn doors? It doesn't boom that fast enough. And it shrinks down and it hits through the barn doors. You must

02:19:21.049 --> 02:19:23.111
admit, there's some beautiful realistic problems. There's one published in the Australian in which some guy worked 
out as follows. Cinderella goes to the ball on the far side, which of course is only a wide hour away from Europe. Midnight

02:19:32.842 --> 02:19:35.305
she's got to leave the ball so she takes off fast. In a non-accelerating graphic, acceleration cars can't go in. that 
troubles back to Europe. Now the thing that does seem to have made it back in time before the witching hour on Earth, her

02:19:41.245 --> 02:19:47.993
time, I'm going to say, was she turned into a pumpkin? First, she turned into a pumpkin. Second, one she had to squintle. 
Sinners were much better as a pumpkin. Next slide. Oh, no. Right. This is an absolutely beautiful slide, which is on a

02:20:00.226 --> 02:20:05.792
photon rocket that has come to has arrived in a pantry system that is a mere thirty-one years away from the Trippin 
nebula, which has always colored stuff down here. An absolutely beautiful piece of nebula, it's an absolutely

02:20:13.952 --> 02:20:17.136
beautiful piece of work. I'll give a plug for the books that came from too. Continue, please. I'm chatting about that. 
Ha-ha-ha! Put it right there. This is good stuff.

02:20:46.795 --> 02:20:47.657
Right. A common organ, born to King Arthur style. What does one do? Naturally, one turns the exorcist. Nothing to worry 
about. Science has taken a hand. Well, naturally we just wrote a copy, part of a copy of course, of an article from Physics

02:20:57.646 --> 02:21:04.316
Fortan, 1972. I think you're not, this is for real.

02:21:09.725 --> 02:21:13.491
It can be quite easy to find out because it has got very well known property. Praying the contract through wall sticker 
and four inches of the lock once. It comes to this thing called quantum mechanics. And we can do a lot of things with

02:21:22.865 --> 02:21:27.391
quantum mechanics, but we'll see it in a little bit, too. Yes. OK, you have this. Anyway, here you're going to learn, you 
know, that quantum geometry idea is a wave mechanics. This established system, that's to say, it's going to go through

02:21:35.903 --> 02:21:42.412
walls bigger than 4 inches, or 0.1 meter. That's where his object, whose associated wave function was decreased to 
about 1. 2.7 got their full altitude at about one, about a tenth of a meter from the mound. And this establishes them quite

02:21:57.342 --> 02:22:04.972
easily, because you work out what the mass of a ghost is. And if it goes up to the bottom... about 10 to the minus 16 for 
neutrons. And that's about a mass of about 10 to the minus 40 kilograms. They're quite light. Now, first of all, this,

02:22:19.244 --> 02:22:21.828
what happens? Any ghost can come down a dead body as they want to do. It's quite easily accelerated. In fact, the energy to 
accelerate a ghost to escape from it, If only we could change the moment's 38 jewels. In fact, any part of brief will

02:22:34.467 --> 02:22:37.692
accelerate a ghost, clean off the earth. In fact, even the sunlight will squeeze a ghost off the earth. So the only ghost 
we'll add to it are in fact a ghost that's trapped inside an old building, dungeon, gets down to speed, or get caught up in

02:22:40.636 --> 02:22:49.108
chains. And they're stuffed! Now, ghosts trapped in this unfortunate man are forced to remain, because after they've 
been brought up, they've all come out from Austin. They soon kind of rose to a steep rate. And then Max's increase. Max's

02:23:04.109 --> 02:23:05.751
going to get out. He's going back. So in fact, if you want to lay a goat on Max's side, what you're going to do is calm it down. 
It's not like it wasn't in an armored race. You're going to sit there and you're going to think about the car and Max will go

02:23:18.571 --> 02:23:21.616
in. You need to watch out for him. There's some nice side effects in this, which I can't go all that too unfortunately. But 
in actual fact, you all know what Peter Dunn said about Red Room Ghosts. In fact, this out here does it quite nicely.

02:23:39.668 --> 02:23:46.154
Because ghosts are wandering around the place, oh yeah, you get all sorts of interesting effects about the real 
inflection of visions of the surface of ghosts. It must be less than any percent or it might never be seen at all. and said,

02:23:50.058 --> 02:23:54.429
''Gus, can only be seen by poor illumination. You should be trying to plot that. I'm going to push you to get to the wall.'' 
I said, ''Go to the wall.'...

02:24:04.294 --> 02:24:04.856
...The other little thing is about them is that they give you scatter radiation. And 
because, obviously, the parking is a great void out there, you have to see the fact that the scattering of shot by

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:25.752
radiation by ghosts and flies to the universe with, well, therefore, a major source of cosmic radio noise. Attempts 
made so far were as strong as to explain this, and unfortunately, if they did too little account of the contribution...

02:24:25.732 --> 02:24:45.327
Also, obviously, the absolute temperature of our space is about 3 degrees celsius at stand fault, and 3 is mostly except 
20 degrees. It's possible the reason ghosts are cold, because if something returns to them, it's very close.

02:24:52.795 --> 02:24:53.696
Obviously, the door is great. It's true. If this is going to be a certain thing, that was the ghost that actually pulled up 
the large, you know, velocity moment. Is that down to the energy in a couple of holes? Yes, it's rather like that thing.

02:25:08.152 --> 02:25:11.415
That record goes up to say that the ghost only walks. When it's not over here, that's in England, and when it's down here in 
Australia. That's got a fantastic timing, I tell you. But even so, ghosts, I guess there's some really, there's some

02:25:20.768 --> 02:25:25.394
really gassed up there. Because of their properties, it's possible that some might have certain figures. In other 
words, there are six differences in my mind. Imagine. Would you even be ghosts? It's okay. And this would be the

02:25:38.969 --> 02:25:45.560
asymmetric wave functions characterized by semi-guides for physics. Molecules are various and this is what happens 
in school. And the element of space would be one in which ghosts of opposite spin would be paired up to occupy the energy

02:25:48.685 --> 02:25:56.718
state of the moment, each carrying one state. This is a highly satisfactory disposition. Why do you have a physicist? 
Now, I think we've got to go on. This is a sort of wearing moment. What's next on the paper? Ah yes, there's more slides. I

02:26:20.626 --> 02:26:23.770
think it's more interesting to go along. Ah yes! This is going to be about the extraterrestrial stage, we're going to 
extraterrestrial technology. The stuff which you can build if you've got the brains to build them in time to do it in. Ah

02:26:33.224 --> 02:26:33.745
yes. This would be a typical monolith in orbit over a moon. I know it's dirty digits they are but not to worry

02:26:39.263 --> 02:26:50.828
about. I wouldn't talk too much. Now, Niven's ring, of course, was a beautiful thing. I mean, it makes lovely paintings 
of stars. But unfortunately, it's a lousy concept. I mean, okay, how do you build a ring? One thinks to oneself. One

02:27:14.288 --> 02:27:16.150
could, you know, actually a lot of tidal effects. Tidal effects are sort of easy to imagine. You just simply take a can of 
water, whirl it on it with a string, and... Steve, you could let it go rigid. In fact, a ring like that has to do things like

02:27:27.347 --> 02:27:32.700
staying rigid. The tidal effects are quite miserable. What do you know together is horrible? Next slide, please.

02:27:42.747 --> 02:27:43.649
It's a better idea. Simplicity is always best. Freeman Dyson's original idea was, see Dyson decided to basically sneak 
in to come think about it. If you want to reason out a problem, you do it in a nice, simple fashion. And he said, right, if

02:27:55.636 --> 02:28:00.807
there exists very large technologies in the universe, What are their upper limits? What can they gain? He talked about 
in terms of mass energy. Simple ideas. So he just simply said, right, let's take the mass of Jupiter. You can know what the

02:28:09.557 --> 02:28:10.658
mass of Jupiter is. And you take the output of the energy from the sun. And from those figures, you can work out something 
like... Dyson's speed. Except he didn't say, aha, he's got the Dyson's speed. He said, aha, and wrote it up in science and

02:28:20.289 --> 02:28:23.773
got published. It's fine. Actually Dyson's an interesting bloke, Diagress. He's only got a PhD. In ordinary degree, no 
honours degree at all, and he's a proper Princeton. He must be a damn bright bugger. Anyway, to continue with the Dyson

02:28:39.058 --> 02:28:47.530
route, what he did was he just simply considered if you smeared out all the mass of Jupiter into a thin sphere. A sphere is 
wrong, it's actually a thin shell, about two metres thick, which means the man could stand upright and put his feet on one

02:28:47.731 --> 02:28:55.903
side and bang his head on the other. a funny thing to do. When people wrote in and said, aha, you build a thing like this 
around the stone with four parts, because of tidal effects, he said, aha, of course you're right. So what he said is you

02:29:07.766 --> 02:29:12.533
have a lot of these things floating around the place like this, which is a ready-built cylinder, no less. And if you say 
that this cylinder is about a mile in diameter, say 10 miles long, which allows the sensors to go, if you say it's 10 miles

02:29:12.994 --> 02:29:21.346
long and about 20 miles long, you're probably better off. A thing like that, you can fill up knowing, you know, it's just 
diabolically easy, just put it on layers. Now let's see, what is the area of a thing like that? It's obviously about

02:29:30.786 --> 02:29:33.772
something like 2 pi r by L long. That's what you'd say it's here to do. Well, let's see, what's that we're going to weigh? 
It's about 10 miles diameter. It's about 5 miles, that's about... It's 30, if it's about 20 long, 600 square miles of one

02:29:43.657 --> 02:29:50.628
level. And if you move the levels in, you admittedly lose your surface area, but you gain a lot. If you thought about 
spinning an object like this over the outer layer with centrifugal force, which would throw you out because it's

02:29:56.257 --> 02:30:09.057
spinning around, you had an internal force of One gravity. As you work in the center, you have lesser gravities. Where 
you can, in fact, install lots of machinery. Things like park lanes, for example, if you wanted to build on that side. It

02:30:22.383 --> 02:30:29.512
would be damned interesting to have a park, you know, like a great open park, like a forest, built artificially, inside a 
cylinder. Where, in fact, you had conditions of 10 gravities. I mean, marvelous, in fact, technically flying through

02:30:32.355 --> 02:30:34.458
trees. That's what I've idea of, though. I like it. Continue.

02:31:00.775 --> 02:31:34.118
Powerful gunner on the motor. The building had a single... What a man! Yes, it's Superman! A strange figure from another 
planet who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities... You can break down exactly

02:31:34.947 --> 02:32:00.128
what he does and work out how he has to do it.

02:32:04.833 --> 02:32:28.962
Right! He can bend the steel bars and he can screw it to anything he wants. He can set them up so he can make full tools in the 
single band. He can work half of them... Now, I said I'd take pictures out of Mary Hill and I will.  Mary Hill and I have a very cool thing about this man. He called it, Mary was a dear woman of cleanliness. Tissue. Tissue,

02:32:43.985 --> 02:32:44.506
baby. Ah, Tissue, then. That's good. Right. I thought that this was a superman. He was too strong, too powerful. He would 
tend to rip a female apart if he was cockulating with it. He would ejaculate at loose transonic velocities and punch

02:32:57.027 --> 02:33:01.572
holes in it. Superhuman power being more powerful in locomotives would tear away through a delicate body and leave a 
preference to sit. But you then undergo I think on that one for a while.

02:33:33.308 --> 02:33:41.239
Now, including the fact that the man is stupid and he's a human or a young, he's noticeably human. Okay,

02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:53.617
Rose! Give it back! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leave trial buildings at a single bound. It's Superman! 
Yes, it's Superman! Strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those

02:34:09.097 --> 02:34:14.966
immortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, then steal in his bare hands. And who disguised as 
Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great Metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth,

02:34:21.034 --> 02:34:30.568
justice, and the American... Now, when you think you need food, get a phone number and say, oh, the master is cooking, I 
should be saying that. That's not a master menu, that's like more. That's like one of those cakes and we never thought

02:34:43.224 --> 02:34:48.933
we'd want to go to the supermarket. Yes, we want to go to the grocery store. Now we go to the grocery store. Well, those of 
you who saw the program Mr. Terrific, this is about a punitive or reticule clay field. And for one hour, you have the

02:34:57.666 --> 02:35:00.790
strength of a thousand men. Great stuff. Now, if you care to sit down and work out howl, but the relative weight of a man who 
had the strength of a thousand men on the ground, you know, the traction down to his planks, He said, well, come around

02:35:10.424 --> 02:35:13.790
here, there's a thousand times stronger water here. What? Go out and look the way for the sign. You're working on every 
way of a man. And you multiply the current stroke by, you divide it by a thousand. And you're going to go out and look the way

02:35:19.219 --> 02:35:20.761
for the sign. You're working on every way of a man. And you multiply the current stroke by, you divide it by a thousand. And 
you're going to go out and look the way for the sign. And you're working on every way of a man. So, give me the answer now. So,

02:35:29.695 --> 02:35:31.557
Ryan, just give us the basic unit. They work on it. An empty unit, and this is the terrific unit. One. It's kind of worth a 
thousand minutes. So, obviously, how about two minutes? So, so, two, three, and two. Obviously, no problem. Now, let's

02:35:43.412 --> 02:35:44.874
face it, right back to Blackmore. Blackmore stars. Four of you, I think. That's Blackmore stars. Now, we're thinking 
it's really a neutron star. A typical neutron star would be to take the mass of the Sun and compress the mass of the Sun to

02:35:55.227 --> 02:36:01.016
the Earth. It's about the mass of the Sun. It's pretty massive. Now, what's the mass of the Sun in mid-Earth? Look at both 
gasmobbies. One of the useful facts about this thing. And it said, Sun, you've got 333,500 times the mass of the Earth.

02:36:16.721 --> 02:36:20.627
Therefore, krypton is a word, a neutron plant, that's a saying. A neutron starts to evolve far enough to be like a planet, 
you know, cool north and quiet and down a bit. There's a planet. We need to be like a planet, not a star anymore. You've got

02:36:32.399 --> 02:36:36.183
to set the gravity back to three. Twenty-one hundred and thirty-three thousand and five hundred times the gravity of 
this whole universe. First light, please. Kill us once, Mr. Barger.

02:36:50.189 --> 02:37:12.045
So take the slide after this one, not

02:36:50.189 --> 02:37:12.045
the one before

02:36:50.189 --> 02:37:12.045
it.

02:37:13.915 --> 02:37:17.399
Yes.

02:37:17.419 --> 02:37:18.461
You know what I'm saying, don't you? Superman in Australia. Now in the comic, if I remember the sort of stuff, they never 
bothered to rationalise how Superman works. Which was neat, as you could sort of say, right? No way of knowing. The comic

02:37:31.938 --> 02:37:33.540
should have been cooked on. He's got all these superpowers, and that's it. But they got to work and they said, like, how 
does he work, you know? I said, Krypton's got a red sun, therefore the Kryptonians don't have superpowers and things

02:37:39.388 --> 02:37:44.214
like that. And he's got to be activated by yellow suns, and he's like, it's, you know, it's obviously no suns. I mean, 
Krypton, like, how does Kryptonite work? It looks like a radioactive element, but they've no Kryptonite in the

02:37:51.524 --> 02:37:55.028
universe. I mean, it's mountains, actually. But we shall fly on. But that's my idea. I don't know if I've been up to this. 
This is a good view of what you can get at. Right. Their explanation for his suit, we hear most certainly comes from a

02:38:10.871 --> 02:38:14.054
heavier planet. We established it comes from a planet which we can say has got 300,000 times more gravity. See, it can't 
be a planet. It's nonsense. I mean, Jupiter's only got a surface gravity of about, oh, about 4G or something. I mean, you

02:38:26.146 --> 02:38:29.069
know, four times stronger, you know, great stuff, fast, fast. If that's not bending steel bars in your band, I'd say, 
Storm bits of wire, yes, must be there. Right. But sons, obviously monsters, monsters, we'll come to that. Funny

02:38:43.555 --> 02:38:46.178
things. Yes, right. It's true. If it comes from a planet that's 300,000 times more massive as it goes, it serves very 
300,000 times out of the earth, it has to be stronger. Not only is it going to be stronger, it has to be made tougher.

02:38:59.416 --> 02:39:02.640
Because otherwise, if you were on crypto, on crypto, it would be flattened. You know, very thin paste. All over the 
planet, sir. In fact, you can work out that on a neutron star, if you drop something like a small coin, in fact, it will

02:39:07.588 --> 02:39:20.532
liberate about as much energy as you have a small nuclear weapon.

02:39:22.604 --> 02:39:26.192
But I think that makes certain assumptions, which I haven't had a chance to go into. A paper where he can trip over on 
Cripple and survive, which means he can survive very powerful explosions and bullets and all sorts of things. Super

02:39:34.451 --> 02:39:39.904
speed becomes easy because he falls 300,000 times faster. That means bloody fast reflexes between the entire nervous 
system is speeded up. In fact, you would think 300,000 times faster than ordinary men. And if you had a nervous system

02:39:50.141 --> 02:39:55.209
comparable to ours, you'd be smart because you can think longer and faster. That means if you take an hour to solve a 
problem and take a human being, 300,000 man hours to think about it. X-ray vision. This one's almost easy, actually,

02:40:06.295 --> 02:40:12.623
because the optical tunneling effects of lasers are not looking at X-rays. His eyes are working like lasers. Now, if 
it's quite possible to think that he lives on a neutron star, we'll always gather it. Optical effects become quite

02:40:19.031 --> 02:40:20.572
weird. So it would be quite natural for the inhabitants to develop eyes that would, in fact, be able to project. Well, 
quite likely, so why not? I mean it's there physically, I mean the biology must take advantage of it somewhere. And let's

02:40:34.475 --> 02:40:36.097
see what happens. One of these other superpants flies. Now, flies are a funny thing, but we can get around that quite 
instantly. Now, all these big biological systems, creatures like men, animals, and dogs, and zebras and monkeys, this

02:40:43.268 --> 02:40:55.848
and that, whatever you like to call it. Biological evolution has to go on. It's got to go on in a gravitational field that 
is 300,000 times stronger than us. Matter doesn't behave like that unless you invent something rather smart. And so, I

02:41:08.345 --> 02:41:10.588
invented a k-effect. I told the k-effect because I was too much to call it the jacarice effect. Anyway,

02:41:15.655 --> 02:41:23.364
back to the k-effect. The k-effect is one of the hypothetical effects which means that It stores up lots and lots of 
energy and it overcomes effects on very strong gravitational fields so that matter can behave as if it were not in a

02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:37.847
strong gravitational field. Immediately, the planet can evolve. You can have ordinary biological evolution and by 
converging evolution you can get humanoids. Kryptonians, in other words. So, Krypton exploded, bang. Newtron stars,

02:41:54.703 --> 02:41:56.808
we don't know what exploded, they exploded. We might get the occasional odd, straight, interesting elements, like 
kryptonite with a K effect. Now, with the K effect, we have a lot of interesting things to consider. Now this means that

02:42:06.865 --> 02:42:11.109
Superman has got stored up in himself and all four of his energy. And this energy can be used quite simply. It means, in 
fact, that by him to survive on the Earth, I mean he can... I mean, the point of fact, an ordinary man can leap quite readily

02:42:14.673 --> 02:42:25.264
into the Earth at a velocity of 1 meter per second. He would leap into the Earth at a velocity of about 300 kilometers per 
second. Actually, it's 333. But this means it's about 30 times faster than he expected us to live the Earth. Which means

02:42:37.058 --> 02:42:40.242
he could hop around the pantry system quite happily. Which means he can really travel, but he's not really moving yet. 
With a K-field, he could do all the interesting stuff. A K-field would be a perfect safe gap for whatever he does. Now, the

02:42:51.356 --> 02:42:53.799
K-field, on the other hand, must be a response modulated. Which means that whenever it runs up in use, it modulates to 
overcome. which means that in fact, he doesn't rip doors off a panel unless he needs to. It's when he leans on things, the

02:43:05.714 --> 02:43:10.625
response comes back for them to be rather human. This means he is virtually perfectly elastic. Elastic in the true 
physical sense. A claimant goes back to its original shape. Plastic means you take something you need to form it and it

02:43:19.453 --> 02:43:23.381
remains conformed. Whereas elastic means that if it's in a certain state shape, and you bash it, bang it, or jump on it, it 
returns to that original state. Perfectly elastic. It's invulnerable. Right, so we've got an invulnerable map. In

02:43:34.312 --> 02:43:39.318
fact, he can be just merely invulnerable on the view that he has super strength. Because, you know, if you fix a car, it's 
up there. And the car is saying, ah, you should be crushed to death. But the old cave effect is working way same. Right. We

02:43:46.807 --> 02:43:49.150
keep pumping in the energy and keeping him in the same state. He would appear to be super strong. Because, in fact, all 
it's doing is he remains in the same state. The car can't fall because it gets in the way. And the cave field keeps pumping

02:43:56.058 --> 02:43:59.282
in the energy and keep him in the same state. Uninterested speculation. Yes. Now, once we've got the kaiting effect 
there, the kaiting, well, one, the effect so we associate a field with it and get away with explaining it. There's

02:44:12.392 --> 02:44:16.179
actually a thing called wattless power, which one finds about. wattless power is interesting. It means you can pump 
energy in your system and the wattless power doesn't do anything. It just sort of vanishes. But you can take it out again

02:44:22.771 --> 02:44:25.716
as though it's there. So in fact the k-effect works like what was power. People are not setting the signs for what was 
power, which I won't go into, because they tend to get rather confusing. But effectively, with a k-field, and the

02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:41.310
socio-k-effect, you can do most of the things. But obviously k-fields must have other side effects. And this is where 
kryptonite comes in. It's obviously affected by radiation. Now, when it comes in contact with kryptonite radiation,

02:44:48.775 --> 02:44:53.543
it obviously does something that is K-field. It obviously draws energy back in the wrong direction. What do you do? Aha! 
We're getting somewhere. Very kryptonite. Probably something to start with. Radiation obviously interferes with

02:45:03.119 --> 02:45:04.542
something. Now, a K-field must store information. It must also, right? Superman is so big, so tall, so such is actually 
right. Now this radiation seeps in and it mucks up the information. So the right superman is 264. He's got two numbers.

02:45:19.039 --> 02:45:19.440
Bang! He's in trouble again. Right, that's very good to know. That's the other stuff I'm not going to bother about that. 
But you get the tip of the idea. Maybe an activation effect by stellar spectra. Red suns were stark. Red suns are

02:45:32.418 --> 02:45:33.719
interesting. As far as I figure out, E.C. don't have a red sun. And it inhibited the K effect, as one might imagine. All the 
plutonics would cure that. So obviously, the effect of a red sun must jam the spectral, must jam the level of the K thing.

02:45:47.955 --> 02:45:50.698
So in fact, the superman would really fly in the past. a great sun. It's kind of filled with jam at that level for a while, I 
guess. So, in fact, you couldn't really even fly around. And if you were up in the earth in a jam, ah, yeah. Yeah, don't cook

02:46:05.663 --> 02:46:07.427
the night's easy. It just simply jabs the input and output of energy. He's stuck. No superpowers in this. Go on. No 
worries, permanently jammed. Poisoning effects, right. Very awesome there. Okay, question for you. What have I left

02:46:20.756 --> 02:46:44.543
out? Brain. I'm Eugene Gray. Why? Why? Why the dope? I know. Destroy his plans. It was easy. 
He would normally suffocate, except the cannibal would continue to restore for a living

02:46:49.168 --> 02:46:55.015
to stay. He doesn't need to breathe. In other words, he's dying all the time. That's right, he's dying all the time. He's 
in bed, isn't he? Actually, I've taken all these speculations purely in terms of a nuclear plant. The normal

02:47:13.197 --> 02:47:20.195
speculation is, in fact, neutron... See, talking with neutron planets, there's nothing to know about them. They don't 
explode. But there is one bloody astronomical objective. We haven't seen, we think it's there, or was there, that did

02:47:23.865 --> 02:47:28.176
explode. None of the big bang. If Krypton were the big bangers, he might explain how all his superpowers very quickly. It 
would also imply, in effect, that as mass goes, he's got the mass of a galaxy stored away inside him, which is in the form of

02:47:36.259 --> 02:47:44.693
energy. It's no wonder he's so bloody indestructible. You can't get enough energy up to a nuclear rungly fixin'. Oh 
yeah, interesting effect from nuclear physics. Boundaries. You have a potential barrier, or actually a potential

02:47:54.006 --> 02:47:58.492
well, which has got so much potential. If anything, it's very important. I mean, you know, it's like saying, you've got 
this incredibly deep well, and you walk up to the well, and you've topped something into it, and it just fall away, right?

02:48:07.222 --> 02:48:08.203
You know, it's like on top of a cliff. So it's like, you know, when it goes out, it's simple. Except, in nuclear 
conditions, you get potential wells, and in fact, they're so deep, they, in fact, you can't throw things into them,

02:48:10.866 --> 02:48:18.996
because they look black from them. So in fact, if he's got some of the energy stored into it, he'll reflect matter to our 
world there. This is one of the reasons we actually modulate it. Otherwise, if he takes a step, he pushes the weight of the

02:48:26.989 --> 02:48:33.515
floor underneath it, things like that, and he can just keep going to go structure here. He has to be modulated. Ah, yes, 
he's modulated, of course. This means that he's maxed. Because he's modulated, he's making the changes of the

02:48:38.199 --> 02:48:48.308
structure he's causing, not the structure he wants, he can quite easily make himself sport, make with human beings. 
What do we do?

02:48:53.864 --> 02:48:54.245
Why? Why? I don't

02:48:55.950 --> 02:49:01.386
know. When

02:49:01.754 --> 02:49:08.761
he flies past the planet, he's got a red sun. He usually drops to the planet. He doesn't keep flying, like he said. Right, 
sir. How can I have a DC-colored stuff like that? What probability would you say would exist on a planet like this? I could

02:49:20.672 --> 02:49:22.233
technically, 353,000. I don't have on a Earth planet this is the planet. Right. So if I know those people who have been at 
the Sydney candle in a bottle, we'll have a lot of trouble. Not just that, but there's some from a visitor who's been

02:49:34.766 --> 02:49:40.052
through the time there. Ah, why couldn't you? You might be. Do you see that, though? That's why. Not as Jim Harris, let's 
be fair. You're a complete seeker. You've got giants, haven't you? Actually,

02:49:54.708 --> 02:50:05.984
we've turned the slides. They're some interesting stuff. Quick backwards, actually. I'm going forward. Okay, 
superman typically writing a change of kryptonite. I'll go through them until he gets real easy. There should be three

02:50:21.792 --> 02:50:27.386
more after that, actually.

02:50:29.451 --> 02:50:31.476
Well, this won't show Superman doing that. Actually, this is incredible. A man who can do everything. Why doesn't he 
take over the world? I mean, there's nothing there. That's probably why. Because

02:50:38.331 --> 02:50:49.991
he's a kryptonian, he's a kryptonian to a bloke. Yeah, actually psychologically, the man would be incredibly 
interesting. I mean, everyone says, you know, right, you can do everything, but you know, where's the challenge? He's

02:51:01.415 --> 02:51:09.693
willing to help creatures which are, in fact, pathetically weak by his standards and incredibly moronic.

02:51:14.684 --> 02:51:18.512
Psychologies, but continue to this life. Now we get to the funny one I do. This is a funny one I took in three parts. That's 
the first one. It actually is the second one. That's the one with the bloody slides. Show us the next one. That is the first

02:51:31.288 --> 02:51:32.351
slide. Show us the second one. That's the second one. That's the third one.

02:51:39.552 --> 02:51:44.459
The last one, I think I could say off, we're going to go into the last round. Well, through them. They're quite 
fascinating stuff. The focus is off. Oh, yes, folks. I just had a time count. For those of you who attend the bank at 8

02:51:53.832 --> 02:51:59.400
o'clock, you're going to attend it at least half an hour later.

02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:11.203
We're sort of empirical type science, you know, sort of stuff you can work out if you look up the physics and the chemistry 
and the biology and you want to bat your brains out about it. But this kind of stuff, in fact, is what Let's try the Swab,

02:52:16.323 --> 02:52:18.186
though. They're all rather Swab, actually. This is what you can do if you just use your imagination. What Brian always 
calls a runcible science vector, as opposed to the empirical, which is more hard-line, rationalistic, and logical.

02:52:31.711 --> 02:52:34.736
Which, of course, has got a lot of blur due, but it's damn hard work. Continue. This stuff, of course, requires a lot more 
imagination. Now, let's go back and think, you know. Bishop Godwin's thing, very pretty, it's a weird idea. Quite

02:52:43.463 --> 02:52:46.387
squadrons of swans. Pegasus in a, well, a boxy version. But to continue.

02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:54.980
Pretty about that one. It's quite a nice start, but... And includes... I, um, oh well, let's go along. You're right. That 
is a flying elephant, of course. Flying elephant. Continue. Yes, it is, actually. That one is a flying elephant. I'm

02:53:22.284 --> 02:53:24.066
ready to fly an elephant. About to swoop, actually. Continue. That one is upside down, but it probably doesn't matter 
with that one. Uh, continue.

02:53:37.964 --> 02:53:38.905
That one is very pretty. Continue.

02:53:46.394 --> 02:53:56.867
Haha, yes, an old friend

02:53:46.394 --> 02:53:56.867
of mine.

02:53:58.366 --> 02:54:00.429
Another battle scene. A kind of armored turidactyl, a few armored armadillos, nasty growlings in a grovy nest, and 
armored armadillos.

02:54:15.614 --> 02:54:21.403
Much more like things rearing out of the ground like fish resting on top of one of them, obviously. Yeah. And these are 
mushroom type things floating in space, which is absolutely fantastic. That slide which enter is really stuffed up.

02:54:30.715 --> 02:54:33.138
It's pretty about that because they are very nice slides. Is that the last one? Well, there's that other little group. 
Oh, that little group. Yes, there's one. Yes, go ahead. Very well. It's actually a map of the galaxy out of diameter of

02:54:40.847 --> 02:54:47.475
about 10,000 light-years. It lists the major astronomical objects within that sphere. Send it on our sun. Continue. He 
leaves you out of focus. Ah, damn. That is a Dr. Hoot as William Huttville. William Hart will stop the video.

02:55:04.573 --> 02:55:07.656
That's John Pertwee at a TARDIS console, modern version. Hi, darling. What's up? Hi, mate. Next one, please. Hi, I'm 
Irving. Come on, darling. Oh, you don't have money. Yeah. Oh, I'd like to again. That's Patrick

02:55:29.542 --> 02:55:39.401
Trout from Doctor Who. This is a follow-up on Doctor Who. And that's John Fertwee being surprised by something. I doubt 
that Alex's saying he's surprised, but that's it for us.

02:55:56.778 --> 02:56:02.466
The following knowledge meets after this. This presentation would have been impossible. The Adventure
