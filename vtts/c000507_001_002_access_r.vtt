WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:04.440
Yeah, good stuff. And, you know, it only cost you about, so it's only costing me about $3 to get 30 copies of, I would say, six 10-page fans and, you know, Anne Zappa. Now, you know, I can afford $3, but I can't afford, I 
can't afford what Bruce is spending on this and Bruce is unemployed at the moment. And he's supposed to be going overseas and he's also furnishing a new house. Now, I'm not that dedicated.

00:30.951 --> 00:31.692
So, The panel obviously doesn't think, then, that the possibility of video cassette bandzines is on. Oh, I think it's quite likely, man. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. 
It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's

00:55.255 --> 00:55.716
on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. It's on. I think it's viable. At the World Convention last year there was a section on the techniques, a whole 
session in the convention, very very popular on the techniques of animation. This was a terrific crowd getter. The videotape at the moment is unreal to fandom. I'm lucky because I'm studying video tape and things

01:22.567 --> 01:29.359
like that, and I have access to machines and tape. It doesn't cost much. But yeah, that's what it is. Sir, are we talking about communications or communication technology? We're talking about communication amongst 
bands. That's right. Practicalities of communication? As a matter of fact, the best method of communication amongst fans isn't fan scenes at all. It's only one side, but the other one is conventions. For those

01:56.800 --> 02:06.833
people who would like to have a bird's-eye view of the Australian conventions, I've got the Australian Convention Handbooks here, as from the National Convention Number 3. And if anybody would like to have a look at 
these after the panel, I've got only 2.2. It's an ad for 19 Somerset Place Melbourne, you may remember. This is Eastercon 72, the 10th Australian Science Fiction Convention at Melbourne University, cheaply

02:19.249 --> 02:30.930
memorable for the complete absence of laboratories.

02:31.687 --> 02:38.896
Eastercon 73, Mini Melcon 71, Etherline 2, Journal of the Modern Science Fiction. Eastercon 1968, 7th Australian Science Fiction Convention 1966, which started off the modern Renaissance. Bow everybody, bow 
your heads in reverence. The World Convention Program book for last year. Containing

02:54.094 --> 03:00.141
Harlan Ellison's signature. It's

03:00.526 --> 03:08.777
a small signature too.

03:10.860 --> 03:14.024
Put his hand prints in there. Art Plate from the 9th Australian Science Fiction Convention Handbook.

03:27.843 --> 03:27.883
Do How many panels have they considered? writing outside a ban. Now, this thing called communication, is it more important to them to communicate and give feedback or have they considered writing in other bills or 
what their attitude would be to writing in these other bills? Would they decline to write, say, a column in a newspaper or some other magazine? Right away about the lack of sleep. Yeah, well, I for one thought of the idea

04:02.474 --> 04:07.882
of writing professionally. Hasn't everybody. Also, it's one stage I applied for a cadet journalist, but decided against it because of the rat race, as it really is. Writing-wise, not much otherwise. I wouldn't mind 
films and photography and stuff like that. Some of those things, I don't do it for communication, that's done for my satisfaction, whereas fencing is done for feedback. It's very strange.

04:46.632 --> 04:59.667
Well, to answer Lee's question for myself, as Lee knows, Lee and I are doing some work at the moment, outside fencing is complete. I've

04:59.647 --> 05:14.162
been

04:59.647 --> 05:14.162
writing some short stories which are pretty terrible at the moment. Yeah, I think that there's probably actually more satisfaction in doing something which I know could appeal to a larger audience than in doing a 
fanzine. Fanzines are easy. Fanzines are very easy to write.

05:30.936 --> 05:36.646
But to write anything outside that field is hard. I personally don't. I think that I spend much time on the fans and I don't want to try and get a perfect looking thing. Sometimes I do a second draft and other times I just 
wake it up straight there. I've got my little bottle of Corfu, I like sniffing it as Michael Cooney would say. And that's all there is to it. I can whack out a stencil in about 12 minutes or something. Do you think you would

06:02.573 --> 06:09.900
get that kind of satisfaction that you get out of fanzines if you do something else? I don't know. If I get satisfaction out of fanzines now, you're upsetting me. What are you doing? Well, look, we're going to have to 
wind this panel up. So I think we'll just finish with Bruce Gillespie. You're all right. Just making one point about this business of challenge in fanzines. People contribute to fanzines on several levels, one of

06:26.975 --> 06:38.005
which it's just a fun thing and they do something without being terribly self-critical about what they do. Other people use fanzines to cut their literary teeth to find out the limits of what they can and can't do to 
improve their writing and so forth. As a matter of fact, some of the most popular science fiction authors, some of our best authors, Ted White, Harlan Ellison, are fans and cut their literary

06:56.962 --> 07:05.711
teeth. Some of these people that earn their living by writing, which is the only real test, are fans and learn to write within fanzines. I think the term is worth fanzines, surely? No, ah. This is still a fan. He wouldn't 
go to conventions. Are we hiding? You still a fan? No, I'm not a fan. What are you? He's probably come here for his morning, you know. Just because you've taken conventions, I mean, I don't like fancy articles. I... Bro,

07:41.288 --> 07:43.511
can I? There are a lot of things that fans didn't know. I don't consider myself a fan, I'm probably a latched fan. You know, I'm a latched Catholic. It still hangs on to you. They leave charisma there. What turns you on as 
meeting the people? No, is it the people? No, it's a... I think what you've read in Science Fiction has been part of fairing them, if you've done it at all seriously, it never fully lets you down. Some are withdrawals.

08:14.674 --> 08:15.816
They're from Science Fiction. I've come to all of this because I've cut the literary paper, the letter con of the magazine. Lots of fans cut their teeth to do that. They're called to make a dent before they were done 
fanzines. That's true. In every old amazing there was a little bit of fanzine. Well look, if David Greger or Ken Ford won anything else to say, just before we round like this. I'm struck dumb about it. I would say that I

08:43.203 --> 08:46.507
don't think fandom is a wild light. I don't think fandom is a goddamn hobby. I think that you agree with Bill Wright that Phantom is a process that we all go through. Some of us don't go through it though. But I also like to 
add my little personal little one. Phantom's a bloody nuisance. Well done, I think that's a good concluding note. Turn

09:10.505 --> 09:17.312
these off, we'll end this. We'll switch from three rounds and cheers. It's good fun. It's good fun. I'm a bit of a masochist. Make the ball clap, Mr. Chairman. Don't give us a clap. Yeah, come

09:27.011 --> 09:33.797
on, come on. On science fiction writers. If every one's agreeable to that. In about ten minutes time. I've been asked to moderate this thrilling panel. the subject of which I've forgotten, I think it's something to do 
with ethnic Aussie SF, or words to that nature. The gentleman on my right is Mr Eric Harris Harris, a resident of South Australia, and an author of some note, if you know your vision of tomorrows, Eric had several

09:58.263 --> 10:17.085
stories in the early issues, You've also published a book on astronomy, haven't you? That's right. I have a faintest idea what his occupation is, but that doesn't really matter. This gentleman here, you know, is 
Wynne Whiteford and the Holiesteam John Foester, earliest John Ozziean. Right. Now, as regards ethnic Australian SF, I will now pass you over firstly to John Foester to hear his comments on the subject. I think it

10:47.423 --> 10:51.129
must have been a conventional long time ago. Well, perhaps it was even before we had conventions again that this subject arose, certainly not the first time, but I think the first time, if I can recall, and there was a 
little bit of chat to and fro, probably involving Lee Harding, and I think also involving John Baxter. about the problem of writing uniquely Australian science fiction. And Mervyn Barrett, who of course is always

11:22.556 --> 11:39.047
sensible about these things, wrote briefly suggesting that we shouldn't be concentrating on Australia, uniquely Australian science fiction. Mervyn always likes to think cosmically. And so in this particular 
case he said, gentlemen, let us think globally. Let us try to write uniquely terren science fiction. Now, I think that what Mervin said is actually quite relevant to what's going on here today.

12:02.390 --> 12:07.857
There are lots and lots of ethnic science fiction types around. There's American science fiction, there's British science fiction, there's German science fiction, there's certainly Polish and Eastern European 
science fiction. And all of these are very, very distinguishable. perhaps with a few very notable exceptions. And to add one other uniquely nationalistic kind of science fiction doesn't seem to me to add very much to

12:26.472 --> 12:48.049
the pool and that what we do need to do perhaps is to write a science fiction which is suitable for everyone, not just for one country. Over and out. Right. Well, I think we should consider the two types, or the two 
distinct types of writing Australian

12:52.741 --> 13:06.550
SF if it comes to that. There is the form which utilises local background color. This is the simplest form and this applies really only if you're writing for local markets because you haven't got much chance of selling 
a science fiction novel on the international market that is say based in Australia. Although Cordway and Smith did it rather successfully. I'm going to ask Derek now who has written science fiction for the local

13:35.887 --> 13:51.430
market and if he could tell me if he's found it effective or not. Well quite frankly I have not found it effective. The general tendency seems to be amongst publishers anyway that we're not going to take a chance on the 
local boys. The reason for this is pretty well understood by everyone is attempted to write science fiction for a local market or for that matter any form of writing for the local market that you have the problem of

14:04.827 --> 14:19.191
distribution you have the problem of working in your own genre, so to speak, and the problem of distribution more or less rules out any hope of either launching a magazine, contributing to a magazine specifically for 
Australian conditions, or for that matter of writing for Australian conditions for an overseas market, except in a very limited sphere, which we attempted to do in the late lamented vision. I think there are a very

14:47.352 --> 14:54.624
large number of people throughout the world that are interested in the exotic and the exotics anywhere where you're not. And that of course includes Australia and there's no doubt about it. There isn't an abysmal 
ignorance of Australia and particularly the urban Australia scene. It'll only be the generally understood comic science fiction side, if you like, of the magma camels and the didgeridoo's and such like. But on the

15:14.791 --> 15:26.713
whole, no, I don't think that we do have any satisfactory outlet for local Australian talent.

15:26.733 --> 15:38.014
I suppose that, as I said before, that the exotic's always where you're not, and therefore there will be a limited amount, but as John pointed out, a full novel length novel length science fiction, the general idea is 
to write it in the neighbourhood of the novella and this of course limits you to a certain extent to develop a theme fully to understand the Australian background is very unlikely to be done in anything under 8,000

15:38.315 --> 16:03.283
words and once you do that I'm afraid you'll have to rely upon an international market and not a local market. I know I've tried very hard particularly in the sphere of children's science fiction And in this alone, 
you've got to be extremely careful anyway, and the background here is far too localised. Our children are urban, they are in fact world urbanites already, and fast losing whatever Australian characteristics that

16:17.080 --> 16:29.791
they would be able to recognise in a children's novel. I'm speaking now and writing for children, but the same thing also applies to adult science fiction. No, quite frankly, I don't see that the local market is going 
to be much of an outlet for budding science fiction writers of any style, either the avant-garde or the old stuff. Well, considering the second aspect, I know one writer, a very prominent science fiction writer in

16:52.355 --> 17:05.967
this country, who to me, constantly infuses Australian characteristics into his stories, this of course is Bert Chandler. And he operates in the tried and proven way of supposedly writing about the far future. and 
at the same time writing about the here and now. His Rimworld stories, as most of you know, are really very fanciful variations on his own experience on the coastal run around Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. His

17:48.598 --> 17:53.385
characters, many of them are just about Australian as you can get, But because these stories are not localised and recognisably Australian, because they are set in the far, far future, Bert is obviously finding a way 
of writing a form of Australian science fiction. He has a novel coming from Wren Publishers in Melbourne, a new firm, a paperback publisher, which is an expansion of his story, The Bitter Pill, which is in vision. And

18:19.871 --> 18:23.355
it is a novel about a futuristic Australia. which was not accepted by any publisher overseas, which I think seems to indicate the point that you must write globally for science fiction. Now when you've been writing 
stuff many, many years ago when you're overseas in America and in England, did you consciously at any time when you were working for those markets try to inject Australian elements into your writing? Well, no,

18:52.360 --> 18:53.782
frankly, no. I think, economically, you have only one major market, that is America, for the simple reason that you've got a population of a couple of hundred millions. And this is about the only one where you can get a 
magazine with circulation approaching a couple of hundred thousand. Now, this applied, I think, in not only science fiction, but other. parts of magazines that I have contributed to. I think that what it is possible

19:25.240 --> 19:37.539
to do is what Frank Reining did in One Story that comes very much to mind, the place of the throwing stick. I don't know if you remember that, I think it appeared in Was It Galaxy? Fantastic universe and then a new world in 
England. That's right, certainly one of the American ones first. Well, now that, this, some of you may remember, I dealt with the warmer rocket range, extrapolated a little bit into the future, where a large rocket

19:50.258 --> 20:18.004
was going up and an aboriginal managed to get down near the launching pad and throw a boom ring into the vines that controlled the direction of the rocket so that you had a the most primitive type of weapon destroying or 
wrecking the probably the most advanced type about the place. Now that, in a sense, it was a bit of a gimmick story. It was essentially Australian because it's the only place where you could have that sort of thing

20:30.989 --> 20:36.436
happening.

20:39.600 --> 20:45.728
So that's another special case.

20:46.208 --> 20:49.172
Do you think there's any point in exploring the exotic part of Australia for overseas markets. I mean, like having a spaceport in the centre of Australia, do you think overseas investors would accept this as a 
reasonable extrapolation and marketing gimmick? Just possible, but I think that, frankly, I think it strains the credibility gap a bit far. I think you'd, again, have your spaceports where in countries where most

21:15.798 --> 21:21.124
of the space development is taking place. I don't think it would include women there. I think the Australian local in this case is a once only job. Yes. You might get away with it once and it's about all. And if you've done 
it well, nobody else can do it. That's right. Yes, nobody else can introduce a boomerang, not a prank. John, do you think there's a quality about any Australian science fiction writing which which does set it apart

21:43.135 --> 21:49.581
from the American or British equivalent?

21:52.164 --> 22:08.400
Well it seems to me that there's scarcely enough Australian science fiction to do this and if you were to try and summarize it I think it's really a matter of saying that Most Australian writers have their work 
published in British magazines and consequently the sort of fiction that seems to represent Australian science fiction is the sort of stuff that appeals to British editors. Now, it may appeal to British editors

22:28.749 --> 22:36.497
either because they like to see the Colonials making good or it may appeal to the British editors because it didn't appeal to the American editors who pay a lot more. Now, if it's the case that it didn't appeal to the 
American editors, then, of course, one could assume that, or one could assume in the days when there were a lot more American editors that perhaps the stories were so attention-grabbing. Nowadays, when there are

23:04.406 --> 23:07.530
fewer editors The prejudices might be very difficult to get around. It may be a different matter, but of course then there are no British magazines nowadays, apart from New Worlds. I think it's fair enough to say that 
in the past most Australian science fiction has been written by people who don't make the full-time thing of it the way even some of the British writers have done. Bert Chandler is about the nearest and of course he He

23:36.923 --> 23:43.969
does quite well without the science

23:36.923 --> 23:43.969
fiction. There's one, because I think the ideal thing is to sell a story in America first and then later in Britain. Sometimes you can bring that off, but you get about five times as much of it in the States as John has 
pointed out. But one thing that I think Germans have It is a field where editor contact I think is pretty important. If you can actually rough a story out and then contact the editor either by phone or else take the thing

24:12.995 --> 24:22.388
along to him just in a roughed out form and talk it over with him. And then sure on the sale, now you can't do this from a distance. Now I found that I was having to operate this way in America, to some extent. And then later 
when I went to England, I found that I sold mostly to Carnell. He goes, I could go along and actually talk to him or ring him up. Now, this saves a tremendous amount of possible lost time in duplicating a story that may have

24:43.684 --> 24:57.043
been put in by somebody else, or perhaps one that you've never heard of, but the editor may know. I think it's fairly important to be absolutely sure that you're selling the thing before you start, or I feel that way. 
I've got one little point about that and this is very important for everybody to pay very great attention to. I once wrote a very short story called The Superdense Man. I thought it was extremely good. I sent it to

25:17.731 --> 25:21.501
America and they told me, yes, This is a little bit, it needs pruning. You're obviously a young author and this needs pruning. I wasn't young, I'm in my 50s, but it said it needs pruning. So it got sent back, at least the 
rejection slip had a pen and ink signed on the editor on it. I sent it to Michael Moorcock before New World took its first plunge and he said, very good Eric, he said, but it's a little bit too broad approach. It needs a

25:43.330 --> 25:44.772
secondary theme. It needs to be a little bit larger. I sold it to the ABC, exactly the length that it was. And this is very important. It's the same story and it wasn't touched. I always make a practice of giving it a firm or 
copy than he needs so that he can cut a bit out to please himself and he still doesn't really harm your story. But now, there's been a lot of talk about loyalty in Australian, professional magazine again and all that sort

26:07.534 --> 26:14.180
of thing. Well, I'm really sure if I was the editor of such a magazine I would not consider trying to get it off the ground using stories by local writers using an Australian low car. Every second or third issue I might 
like to do this put in a story like that but I can't see a magazine using the work of Australian writers who wrote solely about Australian problems, Australian futures and Australian environment. It wouldn't be

26:47.900 --> 26:52.052
exotic enough.

26:53.973 --> 26:55.716
John, what do you think? Are there hopes for an Australian magazine? Well, you asked me this at each successive convention, Lee. It's quite obvious you're not satisfied with the answer. Get more doom laden. But on 
that particular facet of it, we would need stories from overseas writers as well, wouldn't we, to make it here? Frankly, I've said this at the other conventions, so you know already. You can't make a go of it in

27:25.019 --> 27:30.545
Australia in the orthodox way. You can't do it with a newsstand magazine. Now, if anything should convince people of that, it's what happened with rats. Rats, I don't think, has got many claims with all due respect to 
the editors and the many authors whose work has appeared in there, who are in this hall today. Myself, except the professor. I don't think that Rats had a terribly perfect, or that had, might be a little bit

27:54.966 --> 27:59.931
pessimistic. Has a very professional attitude towards either the writers or the readers, for that matter. Certainly it's improved as time's gone by. They proved it could be done. They proved it could be done, but if 
you were willing to lose that many hundred dollars a month, it could be done. And frankly, I think that Rats showed that something which had rather broader appeal than a science fiction magazine still couldn't

28:18.247 --> 28:28.143
succeed. Consequently, if you're trying to sell something in a science fiction line, you'd probably have to give it a title like, very small, that is science fiction, then about two-inch letters, four of them. and 
science fiction forum. People might just confuse it with another magazine and you get your money that way. I really feel that at a time when England can't support a science fiction magazine, talk about Australia

28:55.089 --> 29:06.501
doing it, is really getting way out. If you consider just the sales that amazing and fantastic have in the States, and the fact that in Australia, magazine would have additional problems of distribution over and 
above those, which amazing and fantastic fact. I think it's quite obvious that an orthodox approach to a science fiction magazine in Australia just wouldn't succeed. I don't think that an unorthodox one would

29:32.628 --> 29:44.903
succeed either, but it might have a better chance and that would be to try to do it in the form of a little literary magazine except that you pay the authors. And this, that's a possibility, provided you're willing to put 
a $1.50 or $2 price tag on it. And since Vertex has done just that, put the price on it, and it's published some pretty dreadful material models that I don't think it'll survive. But if Vertex does survive, then it

30:09.628 --> 30:25.190
suggests that there's possibly a market for a high-priced magazine, in which case Australia might succeed, provided that you're willing to sell about 150 copies in Australia and the rest in America.

30:27.734 --> 30:37.367
Eric, have you had any experience submitting to the local fiction type magazines like the KG Murray chain or any of those people? What sort of response have you had from them? Very generous and on the whole where they 
criticise quite constructive and useful criticism also a couple of sales.

30:50.728 --> 30:59.362
On the whole I think that the KG Murray and that type of magazine is a very good outlet for anybody attempting to break into a market. In fact it's one of the easiest ways I would say as far as local publishers are concerned 
for anything of book length so I say you've got a different story. Harking back to John's discussion of the possibility of an Australian magazine I really do feel that a shot in the, a literary shot in the arm such as has

31:10.790 --> 31:24.786
been given by the literary grants recently by this by this present government might have some sort of formal approach to get some form of subsidy for this sort of thing. Quite obviously any art form these days requires 
heavy subsidy, I think. The fact that the Lolli Shops and the big stores are absolutely chock-a-block full of science fiction and most of it rehash from way back seems to suggest to me that there's an eager public

31:38.242 --> 31:52.056
waiting to read this stuff. And as they are doing so, the problems are mainly distribution and or taking, virtually taking a financial chance. Now, of course, we can't do this. As you say, any magazine that you do like 
this is bound to fly for a few months and then hit the deck. But with a government subsidy, and this, I think, requires some careful thought on the part of people that are not only writers but aspiring writers to lobby, or

32:20.892 --> 32:43.513
to, in some, if you like, a quasi-official sense, say this convention, or any convention for that matter, to make some approach to some official in this respect, to say, well, is it possible to have a literary shot, and 
they are somewhat similar to the Council of Arts, the job that was done for new worlds in England. What do you think is possible to do that, John? Do you think it's... Well, after handing out one and a half million,

32:49.259 --> 32:56.951
they're probably willing to throw a few hundred in the direction of science fiction. But then Bert Chandler, as I said, doesn't need it. The approach that's being used by the federal government is, I think, to support 
ventures which have been started. And this seems to me to make some sort of business sense. How do the rest of you feel about the rather sharp division here between science fiction and other material? Do you think a

33:24.608 --> 33:28.074
blurring of that line of demarcation might help? I think if you find that sort of thing in some of Koji Murray's publications, man has been running things that you can only call science fiction stories for quite a long 
while. I think the Tenth and Mortal was one I remember missing about ten years ago. Oh, they do, do it steadily. They've even published Jack Waddon's when Damien Robert was editing. The whole business of Australian

33:53.187 --> 34:05.881
science fiction and how it actually works out, I think is best demonstrated by a little chore I had several months ago. Wake up, Robin. I was engaged for a couple of months working on a projected multimedia spectacle, 
as it was called at one stage, with a theatre in Melbourne. Now, initially, two writers were engaged to work up a synopsis, sort of utilising all these elements, live actors, music and screens. And I submitted a

34:31.724 --> 34:41.858
synopsis and the other writer submitted a synopsis and we had a meeting at the table one night and the synopsis passed around and we all sort of commented on it. And the other writer's synopsis included among its plot 
gimmicks is rock, an aboriginal dance,

34:42.398 --> 35:01.444
various or a magician, a medieval magician, but I don't think the Opera House came into it. But we had much talk and to do about this and in half an hour we decided that although the arts, the people in charge of artistic 
grants would be terribly pleased to see so much Australia scattered through the production, that when you have an opportunity like this, It's best to go the whole hog and do something which has meaning for everybody

35:26.568 --> 35:35.677
rather than which will just appeal to a minority. And so all those ideas were tossed out and we eventually went to work on something with much broader scope, which would be completely Australian in the people working 
on the production. And we were confident that this was sufficient, that why limit yourself to just one small thing when you can reach a whole audience. And I think this is something science fiction does and has to do,

36:02.206 --> 36:19.913
that it has the ability to reach past national barriers and someone in Russia or South Africa can read a story written by somebody in America and the national characteristics don't contribute all that much to a 
success. Are there any questions from the audience? Yes sir. One of the things that worries me about is this perennial question about should there be a state of concern in this area. And there's no concept to debate the

36:31.453 --> 36:36.484
country to want the more worthwhile aspect of satisfaction.

36:39.333 --> 36:41.695
on thinking that it may create. It seems to me that the concept of insisting that science fiction be about Australia's and Australia's context and so on, is that another principle that will stay for the sort of late 
criticism. It's one thing for us to go on to try to have magazines and so forth that use Australian authors, because they will be that Australian authors are restricted from the opportunities that other waters may

37:07.058 --> 37:11.984
have elsewhere in the world, and in so-so's worth while providing for them. But it's quite a different matter to do so with the sort of paperotic emphasis. I think what Bert Chandler has done is very good. I don't think 
Bert is doing it out of paperotic reason, but that's because it's so convenient. How do you do it, by the way? Well, I think, in all high expectations, what Wynn was saying, that the two distinct forms that we're

37:24.941 --> 37:35.935
familiar with, American science fiction and British science fiction, were created by markets, not by individual writers or any patriotism. It was the editors who helped to form the particular literary climate. 
And until we have a consistent publishing field here, we will continue to ape overseas styles. But if we had a really dynamic, John W. Campbell working in Australia, he would help to create a form of science fiction,

38:06.053 --> 38:14.486
I'm sure, which would be easily recognizable as different to the overseas. Yes, Bill? Look, could I bring up a point on that just before we... Just before we hit that point. ...while we touch that? On this point, about 
the two different types of science fiction developing in America and in England. Now, I think the American one was governed largely by people like Campbell and the other editors, the other editors of... the major

38:34.910 --> 38:36.673
papers there, Poucher. In England, I think that they were set mainly by that little scoring list that used to appear in New Worlds. You know where each story was rated first, second, third, fourth, fifth for the 
stories for the previous issue. Can't wind them up, you know. Well, he took a bit of notice on them. I know he might have had to build them up a bit. I think he had. I think he did get some replies. He used to write and tell me

39:06.943 --> 39:11.231
the actual percentage of readers who actually wrote letters into that thing. Yeah, there wasn't many, but I think he did have a sort of a type of thing back there. I think he did actually. It's one of those, anyway. He 
took them seriously. Well, I wouldn't say that. Well, the stories I always liked, we always wound up down the bottom of those things, you know, that's it. Yeah, perhaps you like them. Right, all this ballet and all

39:32.813 --> 39:34.397
that. Bill, what were you going to say?

39:44.688 --> 40:01.735
We're virtually an exclave of the European American culture, and that if we're going to produce anything distinctively Australian, sort of degenerates into one of the bare you could work here. Yes, but Bill, this is 
purely the background. I do maintain that there are things with the national character. which are valid and which will come out in a story of right, whether it's set 200 years in the future, it will come out, but not

40:09.713 --> 40:19.587
until there's a market to develop it. But the people in the megalopolis of Toronto are very much the same sort of people as there are in the megalopolis of Melbourne. You say that beautifully. Can I hear it again? I've 
written it many times, but I'm... I'd

40:37.692 --> 40:42.843
like to answer you on one of those points. I was many years ago in the Megapolis of London and at that particular time they were doing a serial called Journey into Space and it had a juxtaposition between Mars and 
Australia. Oh, the very, very clever and interesting one too. And one of the characters in there, Mitch, was, I never, Australia's just cardboard characters as far as I'm concerned, but I remember being completely

40:58.574 --> 41:10.189
thrilled by this Australian background. I don't know whether an Australian author wrote this particular thing, but nevertheless, there's no argument about it. You do write best about that which you know. And if you 
know the Australian locale, you can write far more convincingly than you would say in America. Good. I'm going to wind this up in a moment. We've got time for one more question. Here's Ken. We've

41:31.133 --> 41:47.811
got that already, Ken.

41:51.233 --> 41:56.624
Yeah, that's what I reckon. Any dissension on that point? No, I consider Jack Waddon as an Australian. Yes, I do. Okay, well thank you John, Wyn, Eric and thank you Lee. We're vacating this so the next programme item can 
go on as scheduled. Thank you for your attention.

42:15.955 --> 42:25.665
She's

42:15.955 --> 42:25.665
a lecturer at Linda's University and she's going to be speaking on children's fantasy.

42:33.973 --> 42:41.440
I ask that it should be said that I don't know very much about science fiction before I started and so I'm saying it. I read science fiction a bit, but I couldn't profess to be expert about it in any way at all. But it 
occurred to me that readers of science fiction might be aware that they have some things in common with readers of fantasy, but that they might be less aware that they have the same things in common with readers of

42:51.049 --> 43:06.769
children's books. The title of a collection of essays that arose out of the MLA's forum on science fiction, which was edited by Thomas Clarison in 71, is, I think, interesting in this respect. It's called SF, The Other 
Side of Realism.

43:26.982 --> 43:38.157
And the title of a more recently published collection of essays on children's literature, also arising out of an MLA seminar, The Seminar on Children's Literature, was the great excluded. Now the definite article 
used in both of those titles indicates, I think, a degree of unawareness of each other among the two groups. It seems to me that we may be involved in the same difficulties and engaged in the same struggle without

43:53.009 --> 44:03.464
benefiting from mutual support and encouragement.

44:05.768 --> 44:06.709
So I'm here today not as an expert on science fiction, which I couldn't claim to be, but to express, and I hope elicit, feelings of solidarity.

44:18.939 --> 44:27.391
The introductory essay in that Clairson collection begins with the point made by Fred Poll at the MLA SF Forum in 68. The point that, and I quote, It didn't matter what had been written in the field of science fiction. 
The real difficulty in obtaining a critical hearing, particularly among librarians and academics at all levels, lay in that from 1926, when Hugo Gernsback founded Amazing Stories, the first pulp devoted

44:34.871 --> 44:59.258
exclusively to the genre, until the 1940s at least, SF had lived amid garish covers and poor print and rough edges, so that You usually carry them home under your coat because you didn't want anyone to know what you were 
reading. That situation is quite familiar to me and to students in my children's literature course. They tend to carry their books around under their coat too. But the important phrase is the real difficulty in

45:17.269 --> 45:21.394
obtaining a critical hearing. And it arose, I think, out of being identified in the critical mind with popular rather than with serious literature. And this is a difficulty which children's literature also faces. 
Although it has the support of some librarians, who are known as children's librarians, and some academics like myself, who are known as our expert on kitty lit, it's not discussed in histories of 20th century

45:36.909 --> 45:54.118
literature, nor do works of children's literature any more commonly than science fiction books turn up on academic English courses devoted to the modern novel.

46:06.519 --> 46:16.832
The other similarity between the position of science fiction and the position of children's literature is indicated by that title of the Claeson Collection of Essays, The Other Side of Realism. In fact, although 
like SF, children's books, especially written for children, can be traced back earlier to the early 18th century. In fact, Golliver's travels is a very interesting text for the history of both our genres. The

46:33.000 --> 46:43.251
concept of children's literature dates from exactly the same period, that is the 1870s and 1880s, as does the concept of science fiction. And it was affected in exactly the same way by the acceptance of realism as a 
criterion for seriousness in the novel. In fact, I was very, very struck when I read this in Clairson's own essay in this collection, this paragraph. He points out that the realist doctrine, we might call it, was in

47:07.775 --> 47:22.149
fact based at least in the way that Zola argued for it on some analogy with scientific procedure so that the modern realist novel could have been called science fiction, but it wasn't. Instead, he said, that name has 
been given to a kind of fantasy which took shape as a diverse recognizable genre during the same period which saw the rise of literary realism 1870 to 1910. It made use of such established conventions as the imaginary

47:37.846 --> 47:55.450
voyage and the utopia, and had seen earlier expression in the works of such authors as Mary Shelley and Poe, but it didn't coalesce into a distinctly separate modern fantasy until the last decades of the 19th century. 
The parallel with children's literature is very, very exact. In fact, I opened the very first lecture I ever gave at Fender's on children's literature by pointing to just that period as a period of crisis.

48:10.508 --> 48:17.558
It certainly was decisive in the development of 20th century prose fiction and attitudes towards it. In England, the advocate of that new wave fashion as it then was of realism was Henry James. And from the point of 
view of children's literature, the opposition between Henry James and Robert Louis Stevenson is most instructive. From the point of view of science fiction, I suppose, it's the opposition between James and H.G.

48:42.869 --> 48:44.750
Wells, which is illuminating.

48:47.653 --> 48:54.799
Now at the time that realism was adopted from France into English criticism, it seemed to mean two disparate things. First, that the artist should aim for very similitude in presentation. And secondly, that novels 
should include previously prohibited material, which at that time largely referred to sex and the working class. Now, as far as the requirement for various similitudes concerned, It's only really checkable, if

49:22.403 --> 49:27.950
you think about it, in novels about contemporary life. Novels set in the past, in the future, or in some completely imaginary world, are simply not checkable for their very similitude. And Henry James demanded that 
novels be checkable in this way. He liked, he said, to be able to say yes or no, at any stage of reading a novel. And he suggested that this is how novels should be read, dispassionately, objectively, with the reader

49:53.020 --> 50:05.854
keeping a sufficient distance from the book to be able to judge its truth. In other words, I presume its truth to life in what was being presented. Now, you can see how this rules out fantasy, which is not about real life 
by definition. And you can see also how it rules out the historical novel, which might have been checkable once, but no longer is. And an SF book, which is set in the future, is in a very odd position in this argument. It

50:34.538 --> 50:38.304
perhaps can be seen in retrospect to have been a very good book. Or it can become a very good book. But it can't be a good book or be known to be a good book at the time of publication. Well, that's an absurd situation, since 
the book hasn't changed, nor has the literary value by which it's being measured, that of being true to life. So if the book hasn't changed and the values haven't changed, how can it get better? Or qualify in any other

51:02.561 --> 51:05.066
way for being called good? And I think that the tendency to make the value of SF dependent on the accuracy of its predictions was a somewhat indefensible critical attitude which was brought about by pressure from that 
criterion of being true to life, which was an effect, again, of the rise to dominance of realism as the definition of a serious novel, a novel that could be considered as a work of art. The criticism of children's

51:35.526 --> 51:43.296
literature has been forced into some equally absurd postures, you'll be glad to know, by this pressure from realism. If you read books about children's literature and turn to the chapter on fantasy, you'll almost 
invariably find the critic expending a great deal of energy explaining how it is that fantasy is good for children, though not good for adults. They will tell you that children like fantasy and adults don't and

51:58.970 --> 52:10.084
probably explain this with some reference to the recapitulation theory of human development. That is the theory sometimes called the culture epoch theory where each individual recapitulates the development of 
the species as a whole. Thus, according to this theory, children are like primitives. They're ignorant and curious about the world and seek explanations in fantasy because they cannot differentiate between a

52:23.716 --> 52:35.029
plausible and an implausible explanation. And you'll notice in passing that this assumes that children like fantasy because they believe it's true, whereas adults dislike it because they know it's not. There's a 
great deal of interesting discussion hinging on that too. For the moment, all I wish to point out is that critics of children's literature have come up with elaborate explanations for what may not be the case at all,

52:52.785 --> 53:17.155
namely that children like fantasy and adults don't, largely because they've been unwilling to face the fact that fantasy had been merely abandoned by influential writers and critics when they adopted the somewhat 
narrow version of realism which flourished in the first half of this century. And this seems to me to be exactly comparable to the reaction of SF critics who were willing to have the excellence of SF as literature

53:21.196 --> 53:31.208
depend on the accuracy of its predictions. So that it could be seen at least in retrospect as having been true to life, or being true to life. Now the second aspect of realism that I mentioned was the inclusion of 
previously prohibited material Now that was advocated by Henry James in an essay that he published on the brink of this century in 1899 called The Future of the Novel. And he complained about the absence of sex, which

53:58.127 --> 54:10.086
by the way he called, quote, the great relation between men and women, the constant world renewal, in the English novel. The reason he advanced was that the English novel had been handicapped by its family 
readership, by what he called the presence of the ladies and the children, by whom, he said, in other words, I mean the reader, irreflective and uncritical. The future of the novel The future of the novel, which she

54:30.338 --> 54:42.394
also called, in other words, the great prose fable, rested, according to James, on, what it decided to do with respect to the young. He declared, in fact, by what it decides to do with respect to the young, the great 
prose fable will, from any serious point of view, practically see itself stand or fall. And in fact, what James was recommending was that the children be sent away to play. with their mothers, of course, so that the

55:00.663 --> 55:05.848
serious novelist could be free to talk about sex. And since he classed all but novels about contemporary life, non-serious or romances, that included Jules Verne and H.G. Wells as well as Robert Louis Stevenson. 
This exclusion has done incalculable harm to children's reading. Books were divided then into serious literature for adults, one might almost say adult males only, and the rest. And the rest, seeing themselves as

55:35.700 --> 55:41.508
popular literature, defined themselves thus in negatives. Now, since James made so much of his case rest on the young, it's not surprising that the effect was most noticeable in the area of children's literature. 
Since serious novels were defined as dealing with sex, children's literature was defined as not dealing with sex, which has been kept out of children's books successfully for most of the last 70 years. And the fuss

56:06.097 --> 56:13.110
you might have noticed in the press recently about what's called the new realism in children's books is in fact an attempt to reintroduce topics such as sex, politics, satire and so on into children's books and thus 
catch up 70 years later with serious adult fiction. Now one expects that reaction in children's literature but it's surprising that I've found that something very similar seemed to happen in science fiction. Until

56:40.286 --> 56:50.525
the last few years I understand sex has been strikingly absent from science fiction, and there too has fairly recently, that isn't the last decade, made a comeback. Someone might be able to put me right on that point, 
but it's what I've gathered from my recent reading. I think it's an indication of the pervasiveness of that elitist critical doctrine of James's that it so successfully preempted the topic of sex from all other modes

56:56.324 --> 57:11.620
of serious writing, except the so-called realistic.

57:14.744 --> 57:25.335
Well, having sketched some ways in which I believe that the rise of realism had a similar impact on the genre of children's literature and on the one hand and science fiction on the other, And I'd like to turn to some of 
the effects of that joint exclusion. And it seems to me that they are by and large, though not wholly, bad. And that for that reason, it is proper to try to achieve serious critical consideration for our respective

57:36.359 --> 57:51.880
genre, rather than to give away the whole business of literary criticism and especially academic literary criticism as a bad elitist job. Now, the worst effect, I think, of being identified as popular rather than as 
serious seems to me to be conservatism.

58:04.430 --> 58:12.990
John would get defined by publishers, bookshops and exchanges by an estimation which they make of a book's market. If you go into a book exchange looking for Dune, you go to the science fiction section. But where do you 
find war and peace? In the war book section? And crime and punishment in the murder mystery section? Now all the sections say science fiction, war, murder, romance, historical, children and so on. and the market for

58:36.089 --> 58:58.418
each is predicted by the publisher and a book which has no predictable market and yet is clearly not serious literature on which you might be prepared to take a risk for prestige reasons, for instance that it's fantasy 
but it seems to be written towards adults or something, will have great difficulty in getting published at all. You see Mr Swift All books about little people go into the children's section and children are just not

59:00.794 --> 59:12.947
interested in politics, so I'm afraid Mr Swift, that although we thought your travel book was just fascinating, we have to turn it down.

59:14.480 --> 59:27.697
So stereotypes of an audience get built up by people who are obviously not willing to risk money backing an experiment in something that's meant to be popular, whoever heard of a non-popular, popular novel. And so 
second-hand shots, I suppose. And in fact, These stereotypes limit what reaches the audience and in turn make the audience more limited in its tastes and so become self-fulfilling. And all this operates against the

59:46.228 --> 59:56.788
emergence of outstanding or revolutionary writers and this operates against development, change and advances in the genre. So being identified as popular rather than serious literature can have the effect of 
making a genre as a whole conservative and discouraging of experiment, which I think is a bad thing. Another effect is to encourage the idea that popularity is an index of merits. And I think this might, if I understand

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:26.995
your program correctly, be reflected in your procedure for awarding your DITMA awards on the basis of a majority vote. Now, you might argue that anyone interested in coming to the conference must be an expert in the 
sense of having read a fair amount of science fiction. But I suggest to you that that isn't a criteria used elsewhere for selecting people whose judgment you can trust. Criticism is, I think, a very practical

01:00:46.027 --> 01:00:48.410
business. We read the critics or reviewers whose judgment we've learned to trust. in the expectation that they'll help us enjoy books more or enjoy more books. And we select those critics on the basis of experience. 
That is, the critics who produced more recommendations which turned out to be fulfilled in our experience of the book subsequently. And we discriminate between critics and reviewers constantly on those grounds.

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:23.228
And the grounds that the critics offer to us are not those of popularity. I don't think we'd be much influenced by a reviewer who says, read this, because a million other people have read it. No matter how many copies 
are, for instance, an Agatha Christie novel is sold, we won't believe that it's a better novel than crime and punishment on those grounds.

01:01:41.343 --> 01:01:49.817
Now in the field of children's books, all sorts of peculiar arguments are constructed to explain why popularity should be taken into account. It's suggested, for instance, that since children's tastes are 
absolutely different from adults' tastes, there's no way of finding out what's best for them other than by observing their own preferences. Thus, there was some official critical justification at hand for those

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:11.669
who protested against the dropping of Enid Blyton from children's libraries. But children love her books was the cry. You'd never hear people seriously argue that children should have lollies for breakfast just 
because that's what they'd prefer. The reason being that people know that something other than taste is involved, nutrition. And some children's literature critics try to make use of this analogy by talking about a

01:02:29.318 --> 01:02:39.514
healthy, emotional and intellectual diet for the proper mental development of children. And I'm afraid that sort of talk makes me feel a bit sick. I think, however, that one can construct an argument without having 
recourse to that analogy on the grounds that it's better in the long run for people to have experience of a variety of tastes, and even that some tastes are more satisfying than others. So the child who gets a proper

01:03:02.629 --> 01:03:08.117
balanced, nutritious diet, all tasting of lollies, is still being deprived. I believe you've probably come across arguments of that sort in relation to the supposed dehydrated carefully selected tablet-formed 
meals of the supposed future. But the general point is, of course, that are made in those books and that I'm making now is that tastes can develop and they can improve and that in our ordinary behaviour we assume that to

01:03:21.858 --> 01:03:33.615
be so. even if you find some people, and some of them, I'm afraid, colleagues of mine in English departments, arguing that all taste is relative and de Gustivus Norne's district handle. And therefore, that 
popularity is not necessarily the best index of merit. What we look for is qualified critics, the critics that we have learned from our experience, that we can trust their judgment. Now genres such as children's

01:04:00.207 --> 01:04:17.355
literature and science fiction, which were some 70 years ago or so pushed willy-nilly into the class of popular literature, have, I'm suggesting, suffered from the temptation to regard popularity as an index of 
merit. So on these and other grounds, I think it's vital to keep fighting for critical recognition for the best books in our genres and not to give up and disgust, no matter how irrational or prejudiced the opposition

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:33.744
may be. Now, within children's literature, the impression I have after a few years' fairly intensive reading and teaching is that the majority of the best books published for children over the last 40 or 50 years have 
been fantasy of one kind or another. And the reasons for this are not far to seek. Fantasists found it virtually impossible to find an audience elsewhere, that is, to get their work published except as children's

01:04:58.473 --> 01:05:06.583
literature. So, fantasists, no matter how good, were forced to write for children. A realistic writer's work could get published as an adult book, even if it concerned a child or an adolescent, like a book like The 
Catcher in the Rye is a case in point. But a fantasist could not. And on the other hand, it's also true that fantasy was so despised that one could get away with a great deal by writing in fantasy which one could not get away

01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:38.845
with in realism for children. So a writer who wanted to write for children would be likely to turn to fantasy to escape the cramping restrictions placed on pseudo realism for children.

01:05:51.921 --> 01:06:02.537
Now when I think of these best works over the last 50 years, I find that titles that come most readily to mind tend not to be works in science fiction. But if anything, they're oriented towards the past and towards 
historical fantasy. I'm thinking of not only writers like Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, but Philip of Pierce, Tom's Midnight Garden, Alan Garner's Owl Service, Elador, Moon of Gomorrah, William Main's Earth Fasts, Lucy

01:06:12.545 --> 01:06:33.165
Boston's Green No Books, Mary Norton's Borrowers Books, and most recently, Russell Holman's Marvellous Book, The Mouse and His Child, which I recommend. Now, I'm afraid that the reason for the absence of science 
fiction from the list is not far to see, either. And that is this outlet. The outlet for adult science fiction was available in the magazines, which we've just been talking about, and which have played such an

01:06:46.321 --> 01:06:57.499
important part in the development of your genre. And the depressing thing is that when writers can get the adult audience, especially if it's the adult male audience, that is what they'll go for, and leave 
second-rateers to fall back on writing for children. I say especially in adult male audience because we might compare the situation in children's literature of science fiction with that of the historical novel,

01:07:13.728 --> 01:07:24.803
the straight historical novel. You remember that the historical novel was disqualified in the same way that SF set in the future was disqualified from consideration as true to life. And you remember further that the 
genres pushed out into the popular literature category got market typed. Well, it seems clear to me that science fiction got market typed as male and the historical novel got market typed as female. The readership of

01:07:51.665 --> 01:08:01.424
science fiction is, I think, still largely male, and that of the historical novel is females and children. The historical novel has in fact flourished much more in children's literature than has, until recently, 
science fiction. And that clearly shows, I think, that when a genre is relegated to women and children readers, writers would assume right for children as for women. But where they have an opportunity to write for a

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:27.409
male adult audience, they will take it more readily and not entertain the possibility of writing for children. And I suspect, though I might again be corrected that the The slow trickle of women writers into the field 
of science fiction has increased the chances of science fiction getting written for children. Since that's another amiable feature of the influence of sex stereotypes on reading habits, that it's assumed that

01:08:39.821 --> 01:08:47.575
women will want to write for children.

01:08:50.272 --> 01:09:02.108
Although I haven't come across as yet any work of science fiction for children, which is as good as the fantasy works which I cited earlier, I have come across some ones that I think are very good. And one of the features 
which makes books less than first-rate, I think, is the assumption that issues must be simplified for children. And one side effect of this is that you tend to get very clear statements of the going themes and perhaps

01:09:14.285 --> 01:09:27.561
prejudices in books for children, which is in often itself to make them interesting reading. So I thought that it would be of some interest to compare in some detail two children's books, which both seem to me to be very 
good, though not at the first rank, one of which is science fiction, nor not purely science fiction, and the other, historical fantasy. Both of these are described as mixtures, incidentally, in their blurbs. The

01:09:52.081 --> 01:10:01.774
science fiction book is described as a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, and the historical fantasy is described as a mixture of fantasy and truth.

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:17.407
Now, these two books, that's Madeline Lengel's A Wrinkle in Time, which some of you might know, and Pauline Clark's The Twelve and the Genie, both came out about 10 years ago, I think in the same year. And Madeline 
Lengel's book won the Newbury Medal, the children's books in America, and Pauline Clark's the English Medal, Carnegie Medal. So I think they're very comparable as books. Now, Madeline Lengel's book, A Wrinkle in

01:10:31.566 --> 01:10:34.410
Time, concerns three children who go on a quest through a tesseract or wrinkle in time in search of a scientist who's the father of two of them. They have to rescue their father from the dark planet Kamazotz, which is in 
the power of an evil force, customarily referred to as it. They're given some initial assistance by three Aliens, I suppose they are, who in the form that they most frequently materialise before the children are

01:10:58.336 --> 01:11:11.298
three rather comic old women, which is really Mrs. What's It, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which. Now apart from rescuing their father, the children are in this action participants in a wider struggle between the evil force 
represented by it, and the rest of the universe, which is trying to resist being engulfed. And we gather, though it's not explained, that merely getting their father back alive constitutes a major, though

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:40.649
temporary, victory in this ongoing struggle. Something like Don Kirk, in fact. Now, the Twelve and the Genie also involves three children and a rescue mission. One of these children finds in these three are 
siblings. One of them finds in the attic of their New Yorkshire home, an old bundle containing 12 century old wooden soldiers, which he unexpectedly discovers a capable of coming to life, and that they have lengthy

01:11:55.686 --> 01:12:21.027
and interesting histories of former campaigns, and names such as Buttercrashie and Gravy and Cheehee and Stumps and so on, and that they were formally protected by some children, or at least humans, that they refer 
to as the genie. And this child, Max, who discovers them, they refer to as a new genie. And Max and his sister, two of the children, become protectors of the gallant troupe. The troupe is known as the 12, the children as

01:12:38.284 --> 01:12:41.087
the genie. They learn, however, that the toys of the former property of the Bronte family, who invented the stories and then doubt the toys with the history that the toys recount to them, and whose former home, 
Holworth, is nearby. The existence of the soldiers, however, is a matter of historical interest, especially to literary academics. And an American professor offers to buy them for 5,000 pounds. And the third child

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:21.303
of the family, an older boy, who along with his parents and everyone else doesn't know of the special properties of animation of the soldiers, writes offering to sell them. And as the prospect of being sent to some 
American museum doesn't appeal to the 12, the two children determined to return the soldiers to their former home at Horworth instead. But fittingly, the soldiers must be allowed to retain their dignity, freedom

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:49.570
and independence by making the massive two or three mile trek themselves at night and in secret because the place is soon swarming with reporters and people both greedy and curious. And the mission is accomplished, 
as is the mission in Wrinkle in Time, with some nasty moments and mishaps. And the toys are returned to the Harworth nursery, where they are frozen wooden soldiers with featureless faces by day and living

01:13:56.289 --> 01:14:04.791
personalities by night.

01:14:07.454 --> 01:14:20.494
Now, the way that these two stories, which are both very interesting and readable, reveal some of the common places, as it were, of the genres to which they belong is likely through theme and characterisation rather 
than through plot. As I have indicated, both plots are structured on the old rescue quest motif. But consider first the themes and characterisation of a wrinkle in time. The central character in that novel is a

01:14:33.253 --> 01:14:36.718
pubescent girl who's introduced as a plain, awkward, misfit, warmly attached to her family, but not a failure at school. She has in fact the classical, ugly duckling attributes, raises on her teeth, and mouse-brown 
hair, and we can predict, I think, from these props that she'll turn out to be a swan. The sibling to whom she's particularly attached, and with whom she shares her adventure, is her baby brother, Charles Wallace.

01:15:05.254 --> 01:15:06.756
Again, we can deduce that he is introduced as having, that he is special from the fact that he's introduced as having the local reputation of being subnormal in the neighborhood. And we can deduce from that the fact 
that he is indeed a genius. But just in case we're in any doubt on that point, the third page of the story, when nothing much has appeared except Meg's thoughts as she gets out of bed on a windy night, her reflections are

01:15:21.692 --> 01:15:36.692
extended to include the following reminiscence. thinking about Charles Wallace. How did Charles Wallace always know about her? How could he always tell? He never knew or seemed to care what Dennis or Sandy were 
thinking. It was his mother's mind and Meg's that he probed with frightening accuracy. Was it because people were a little afraid of him that they whispered about the Murray's youngest child who was rumoured to be not

01:15:56.044 --> 01:16:02.713
quite bright? I've heard that clever people often have subnormal children. Meg had once overheard. The two boys seemed to be nice, regular children, but that unattractive girl and the baby boy certainly aren't all 
there. It was true that Charles Wallace Seldom spoke when anybody was around, so that many people thought he'd never learn to talk. And it was true that he hadn't talked at all until he was almost four. Meg would turn

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:31.215
white with fury when people looked at him and clucked, shaking their heads, sadly. Don't worry about Charles Wallace, Meg. Her father had once told her. Meg remembered it very clearly because it was shortly before he 
went away. There's nothing to matter with his mind. He just does things in his own way and in his own time. I don't want him to grow up to be dumb like me, Meg had said. Oh my darling, you're not dumb. Her father answered,

01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:52.332
you're like Charles Wallace. Your development has to go at its own pace. It just doesn't happen to be the usual pace. How do you know Meg had demanded? How do you know I'm not dumb? Is it just because you love me? I love you, 
but that's not what tells me. Mother and I have given you a number of tests, you know. Yes, that was true. Meg had realized that some of the games her parents played with her were tests of some kind, that there had been more

01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:17.573
for her and Charles Wallace than for the twins. IQ tests, you mean? Yes, some of them. Is my IQ okay? More than okay. What is it? That I'm not going to tell you, but it assures me that both you and Charles Wallace will be able 
to do pretty much whatever you like when you grow up to yourselves. You just wait till Charles Wallace starts to talk. You'll see how right he'd been.

01:17:40.912 --> 01:17:44.135
So, of course, the two children are more than very intelligent. They're super intelligent. There are, as you gather, two other siblings, twins who are nearly normal, and don't therefore figure in the story very 
much. The third participant in the adventure is, in fact, from another family. In fact, from an underprivileged family of 11 children, which we learn within the first dozen lines of dialogue after he appears. He's

01:18:06.874 --> 01:18:11.481
challenged in the woods by Meghan Charles Wallace going off to see Mrs. Watsett. And he's asked why he's there, and he answers, I just came to get away from my family. Charles Wallace nodded. What kind of family? They 
all have running noses. I'm third from the top of 11 kids. I'm a sport. At that, Charles Wallace grinned widely. So am I. I don't mean like in baseball, Calvin said. Neither do I. I mean like in biology, Calvin said

01:18:32.698 --> 01:18:36.764
suspiciously. And of course, Charles Wallace knows just what he's talking about. Now, Calvin, I think he's 14, his description of his family is runny nose, nothings, among whom he is a sport because he's bright. 
seems to me to be somewhat callow, but I accept it in reading the story because the boy's only 14 and since this book already presents itself as one in which family solidarity is emphasised, one assumes that his

01:18:51.106 --> 01:19:14.937
contempt for his own ordinary family and his admiration for the special Murray family will be straightened out sometime later in the story. But what happens immediately is that the highly intelligent special 
Murray family takes into its bosom and treats him like an orphan. The genius infant Charles Wallace invites him to dinner, and when Calvin denies, on account of the invitation not issuing from Charles Wallace's

01:19:25.092 --> 01:19:41.900
mother, who does, after all, scientist or no scientist have to do the cooking, Charles Wallace replies, oh, she'd be delighted. Mother's all right. She's not one of us, but she's all right. What about Meg? Meg has it 
tough, Charles Wallace said. She's not really one thing or the other. What do you mean, one of us, Meg demanded? What do you mean I'm not one thing or the other? Not now, Meg, Charles Wallace said. Slowly, I'll tell you

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:02.333
about it later.

01:20:03.334 --> 01:20:17.256
So, so the trio who are selected for the adventure consists of two male children who belong to a select group of geniuses and a girl who has it tough because she's neither clearly exceptional nor clearly ordinary. And 
what happens is, of course, that the girl becomes the heroine of the adventure. An adolescent love relationship develops between herself and the 14-year-old Calvin. The genius infant gets sucked in by the monster

01:20:29.049 --> 01:20:33.553
and has to be rescued along with the father. Note that he gets sucked in precisely because he's the most intelligent and most special of the trio. The girl manages to pull off the rescue of both father and then 
subsequently brother because out of all of them, father, Calvin, Charles Wallace and herself and the father. She is the one who has a gift which the monster has not got. She's told this, but she's not told what the gift

01:20:57.251 --> 01:21:00.195
is. And here's the climax. I bet you've guessed it already. When she has returned to the central chamber where the giant exposed brain, which is it, has Charles Wallace imprisoned. There was a sudden sucking and she 
was within. It was as though the wind had been knocked out of her. She gasped for breath, for breath in her own rhythm, not the permeating pulsing of it. She could feel the inexorable beat within her body, controlling

01:21:24.306 --> 01:21:29.740
her heart, her lungs, but not herself. Not Meg, it didn't quite have her. She blinked her eyes rapidly and against the rhythm until the redness before them cleared and she could see. There was the brain, there was it 
lying, pulsing and quivering on the days, soft and exposed and nauseating. Charles Wallace was crouched beside it. His eyes still slowly twirling, his jaw still slack as she'd seen him before, with the ticking as for

01:21:49.544 --> 01:21:58.337
it reiterating the revolting rhythm of it. As she saw him, it was again as though she had been punched in the stomach, but she had to realise afresh that she was seeing Charles, and yet it was not Charles at all. Where was 
Charles Wallace? Her own beloved Charles Wallace. What is it that I've got that it hasn't got? You have nothing that it hasn't got, Charles Wallace said proudly. How nice to have you back, dear sister. We've been

01:22:21.055 --> 01:22:22.096
waiting for you. We knew that Mrs. Watson would send you. She's our friend, you know. From a pouring moment Meg believed, and in that moment she felt her brain being gathered up into it. No, she screamed at the top of her 
lungs. No, you lie! For a moment she was free from its clutches again. As long as I can stay angry enough, it can't get me. Is that what I have that it doesn't have? Nonsense, Charles Wallace said. You have nothing that it

01:22:45.591 --> 01:22:47.133
doesn't have. You're lying, she replied, and she felt only anger towards this boy who was not Charles Wallace at all. No, it wasn't anger. It was loathing. It was hatred, sheer and unadulterated. And as she became lost 
in hatred, she also began to be lost in it. The red miasma swam before her eyes. Her stomach churned in its rhythm. Her body trembled with the strength of her hatred and the strength of it. With the last vestige of

01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:13.695
consciousness, she jerked her mind and body. Hate was nothing that it didn't have. It knew all about hate. You're lying about that and you're lying about Mrs. Wotsit, she screamed. Mrs. Wotsit hates you, Charles 
Wallace said. And that was where it made its fatal mistake. For as Meg said automatically, Mrs. Wotsit loves me. That's what she told me, that she loves me. Suddenly she knew. She knew. Love. That was what she had that it

01:23:38.126 --> 01:23:40.650
didn't have. She had Mrs. Wotsit love and her fathers and her mothers. and the real Charles Wallace's love and the twins and aunties, and she had her love for them. And that, of course, is what she uses.

01:23:55.728 --> 01:24:05.900
So it's love, family love, which achieves the rescue, and that's what Meg has, that her male partners in adventure do not. They have brains, she has love. And in the final family reconciliation, Calvin is included as 
one of the elite Murray family, which now has everything. There are a number of points which I think are worth noting, but perhaps I should talk about them after I've outlined the character and theme of Pauline Clark's

01:24:20.162 --> 01:24:30.376
book, The Twelve Magini. The central character in this book is the young boy. Once again it's a young boy who has special gifts of intuition which make him the person for whom the toy soldiers come alive. Once again he's 
presented as intelligent but this time just ordinarily intelligent not a genius. Once again there's an older sister who shares the adventure Once again, what they have to offer is distinguished carefully. He is

01:24:58.549 --> 01:25:02.896
more intense in his reaction to the toy soldiers, more passionate. She is more careful, thoughtful and tender. And once again, there's also a 14-year-old boy involved. This time, as I said, a sibling. And this book, 
an English book, avoids sex completely. The older sibling is, in fact, the one who threatens the safety of the 12 and is an airing child. You know, the typical childhood airingness, meanness, money-grubbing,

01:25:25.956 --> 01:25:32.463
slightly bullying of younger siblings. The explanation of the soldiers coming alive that is offered is that the genius of the Brontes brought them to life. A metaphor for creativity, in fact, made actual and 
literal. But the children of the story, Max and Jane, are not geniuses. So why do the soldiers come to life for them? And the explanation is predictable again. And when Max finally reads the Bronte's Juvenilia with the

01:25:56.167 --> 01:26:06.321
invented history of the toy soldiers called the young men, he reflects. And the genie imagined them all so real, he thought to himself, that the young men, that's the soldier's name for themselves, still remember. 
They're still alive. Could this be what it was? and then he felt thinking of them in turn and which he loved best. He told Jane and his mother that nobody could love anything more than he loved the 12s now. And this was

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:28.467
true. He wondered if this was another reason why they were so lively because he loved them and they trusted him. And he saw it again, the power of love coupled with the creative imagination which comes into play. There 
is a somewhat religious cast to the Twelve and the Genius, which is also present in A Wrinkle in Time. In the Twelve and the Genius, a friendly parson is allowed to see the Twelve's triumphal re-entry into Harworth's

01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:59.211
parsonage. And the parson, Mr. Haweson, thought, I cannot believe it, and yet here they are before my eyes, such is the power of genius to make things alive. So do the creative genie echo their creator. And this is a 
chord which is also struck in a wrinkle in time when Mrs. Watsit, the comforter, explains that the children are not alone in their fight. And we're not alone, you know, children came, Mrs. Watson, the comforter, all

01:27:23.667 --> 01:27:33.426
through the universe it's being fought, all through the cosmos, and my, but it's a grand and exciting battle. I know it's hard for you to understand about size, how there's very little difference in the size of the 
tiniest microbe in the greatest galaxy. You think about that, you think about that, sorry, and maybe it won't seem strange to you that some of our very best fighters have come right from your own planet. And it's a

01:27:49.144 --> 01:27:52.513
little planet, dears, out on the edge of a little galaxy. You can be proud that it's done so well. Who are our fighters being? Calvin asked. Oh, you must know them dear, Mrs. Watson said. Mrs. Who's spectacles shone out 
at them triumphantly, and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. Jesus, Charles Wallace said. Why, of course, Jesus. Of course, Mrs. Watson said. Go on, Charles Love, there were

01:28:14.392 --> 01:28:15.974
others. All your great artists, there have been lights for us to see by. Leonardo da Vinci, with Calvin's suggested tentatively, and Michelangelo, and Shakespeare, Charles Wallace called out, and Bach, and 
Pasteur, and Madame Curie, and Einstein. Now Calvin's voice rang with confidence, and Schweitzer, and Gandhi, and Buddha, and Beethoven, and Rembrandt, and St. Francis, and so on.

01:28:40.231 --> 01:28:49.041
The family background in the 12 and the genie is comfortable, intelligent, middle class, but it's much less important there than in wrinkled in time. And there is no, I'm glad to say, Cinderella-type rescue of a 
working-class child displaced out of its proper intelligence.

01:29:03.955 --> 01:29:06.919
A funny name, is all it is, that the soldiers give Max. It gradually exposes its other conventional meanings of genius, a very creative intelligence, and then the root sense which is related to generate and creating 
life. In fact, I have to say that although I consider both books good, I do consider the twelve and the genie better because it's a subtler book. I find it less offensive in its social attitudes and less partisan about

01:29:28.464 --> 01:29:34.389
the values it espouses. Madeleine Lengel places so much emphasis on the superiority of brains in the early part of the book that she has to make the apotheosis of the power of love very melodramatic in order to 
counterbalance the emphasis of the earlier book. Now, although you might think it's a large conclusion to draw from illustrations just from two books, I think that difference does arise from the fact that the

01:29:51.235 --> 01:30:11.138
science fiction writer writing for children is aware that there is an alternative adult audience somewhere else for science fiction and therefore is much more inclined to oversimplify and overdramatize when 
writing for children than the writer of fantasy, historical fantasy, who has no real alternative. Thanks for listening.

01:30:41.442 --> 01:30:42.989
Yeah. I remember when I was, you know, you had to come home with that. I thought it was very bad stuff. I didn't get past all the few pages. What I really liked, it was Andrej Norsen and Robert Ackermann. Yes, quite. Yes, 
quite. I happened, I was born in Red Two or Three Beach in their books, and I thought they were good. The reason I chose the Madeline Lengel book was because of the exact parallel in time and treatment and things like

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:11.886
that. I don't think I chose it as a prejudice choice. Now, let me see. Yes, all I can say is that I do think the Doctor Northman and Hannah and Hannah are quite good, but I've only read one or two of each of their books. What 
are the reviews on Imagine Faraway? Yeah, I can't really answer that with much immediate knowledge either, because I've never read it since I was a kid. I think, I remember rightly, People do seem to think that that's

01:31:49.668 --> 01:31:54.814
Enid Biden's best writing. That's where she wrote the best. What people object to is largely the limited vocabulary of her books and the somewhat unhappy social attitudes that some of them present. Do you think not 
unlike the social attitudes of the Marilyn Engel book, actually, and that you find all over children's fiction?

01:32:18.862 --> 01:32:21.706
even if I can seem to have less and less to redeem her. The point is that she wasn't sort of banned. She just sort of fell off the bottom of the list where librarians have only a certain amount of money to buy books each year 
where the standard of children's literature has been rising over the last 20 years. She has simply gone down in merit as well as everything else because she's been surpassed that film. But apart from not buying new

01:32:44.266 --> 01:32:48.570
things, they also grabbed the old stuff, right? They said it wasn't going to be replaced, yeah. I said they didn't take it out of the show. No, no, but you know, as books wear out, they weren't replaced, yeah. You 
compared England flight and insurance literature, being popular, but not good because of that. probably

01:33:08.592 --> 01:33:36.203
because children's libraries perhaps have less funds you know that the collection is will be smaller you'll find in the children's library than in adult library and granted that they have small funds they feel that 
they have to be careful in their choosing. But it's also the fact that children's librarians feel, you know, the ones that I've talked to feel that they have an important responsibility in selecting books for

01:33:39.247 --> 01:33:55.830
children, you know, that you can in fact influence children's tastes by the range of what is available to them. And, you know, I think one would have to agree a child who never gets near, you know, any great selection of 
books as being deprived in some way, I agree,

01:34:05.377 --> 01:34:15.434
and yet I think that if you take out the children's libraries and what children like, you're going to be able to work with them. Oh yes, that would certainly be true if you use that as a criterion for putting things out. I 
mean, it doesn't work the other way. A book being popular doesn't mean that it's good, but it doesn't mean that it's bad either. And to hear some of the elitist critics talk, you would think that it did. And that's

01:34:33.545 --> 01:34:36.609
strongly suggested by Henry. James's attitude in that essay, The Future of the Novel, he seemed absolutely dismayed that the novel was galloping so in popularity. He thought that simply being popular would reduce 
its chances of being art. Now, we don't call that obviously. Oh, I think that there's nothing attaching to the form of pictures with balloons and so on that makes it good, bad, or indifferent. I presume they have

01:35:09.636 --> 01:35:21.317
exactly the same potentiality for being good, bad, and indifferent comics as wholly text books have of being good, bad, and indifferent.

01:35:24.605 --> 01:35:41.247
a lot

01:35:24.605 --> 01:35:41.247
of the funny things that people say when they're talking about children's books and children's reading I have arisen out of the circumstances that I've been talking about. That is, they've been forced into an almost 
indefensible position. That and the very fact that they feel very proper responsibility may make them more anxious about this or that or the other being good for children.

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:09.090
Wouldn't it be right in thinking of the general Australian writers of children's books? are doing better in satisfaction before you were not really too happy about how well you were doing that. They're doing jolly 
well, as you're probably thinking of the fact that I haven't settled on the Carnegie Prize last year.

01:36:31.598 --> 01:36:36.784
that the peculiar situation with children's books is that it is so very international. The translation activity, for instance, in children's books is much, much higher than it is in adult novels of any kind. And it's 
quite interesting to speculate about that. I'm not quite sure why it comes about. It may be because children's books aren't likely to be offensive in any way or at all. I don't really know but in fact children's books

01:36:59.172 --> 01:37:01.575
travel. And of course the well-meaning people who promote children's books are also in favour of other general good ideas like international understanding. So they want kids to read books about how children live in 
other countries and things like this. All those sorts of factors might contribute. Well,

01:37:21.582 --> 01:37:40.651
I actually don't like the whole definition of a genre. I think somebody in the panel before was wondering if what we might gain from going for breaking down the boundaries, breaking down the notion that we have a 
specific genre. I'm very much in favour of that as far as children's books are concerned. I

01:37:56.736 --> 01:38:11.080
was just thinking, you

01:37:56.736 --> 01:38:11.080
know, because of the babbles on the wall of the city, of the towers on the edge, ends on the catapult. have been recommended by adults and children. Oh, I see. Yeah. Nothing on the grid. No, quite. And you see this 
withholding from children of horrific material, I think, has only produced a massive underground in horrific material. You know,

01:38:32.188 --> 01:38:37.576
listen to children's playground rhymes. You wouldn't get anything more horrific than some of them.

01:38:46.362 --> 01:39:06.565
What we were making about the provisional librarians setting themselves up to form the funding taste for all the places of children could go too far. in seeking to do this, I know you can't go completely in the other 
direction and allow the level of pacifism to find itself. And as professionals, just follow the popular trend to start to be a balance, particularly with the children's development agenda. I think that this is

01:39:29.509 --> 01:39:32.653
virtually the reason such as ours. I've noticed that in over a decade of contact with a certain family, there is a continuous tension between those people that read what the literati call badly written books which are 
very popular and which cater to a low level of public taste and books which they consider works of by artistic standard in which the people who enjoy the more popular and badly written stuff find jolly hard to read. And

01:40:16.670 --> 01:40:23.886
the fact that the literati discusses amongst themselves as a kind and elitist group in the family. I see. One thing I've noticed in recent years is that the tendency for the two groups to more or less come together is the 
gradual increase in the place. And the gradual appreciation of qualities in the bad books that are far the way around here, the qualities that make them good, the spiritual lens for the series, the moral world. In

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.603
fact, thank you Mr. Constance. Yes, there's obviously a private dispute in there somewhere but I think that A cult, and I don't mean that as a pejorative word, is just what you get, like you know that the Tolkien has a 
massive sort of fairly private following, is just what you get when something is excluded from proper recognition and people feel that it ought to be talked about.

01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:27.211
Sorry? Yeah. But I would like such groups not to turn their back on the possibility that what they actually want is critical recognition for the genre, which once achieved, they can then dissolve themselves. I mean, 
at least in a sense you can, that is to regard yourself as a pressure group.

01:41:54.593 --> 01:42:04.950
You see, although I have started up a special course at Lenders called Children's Literature, and that amounts to acknowledging that it is separate, I've done that because it's the only way I could get to teach it in a 
university at all. What I hope in time is that I will be able to persuade my colleagues to consider books like Alice in Wonderland when they're making up 19th century novel courses, you see. And if that happens, then my

01:42:20.345 --> 01:42:29.073
course can go away because children's literature will have its proper place. And I hope that you would feel the same about science fiction. I was told

01:42:34.512 --> 01:42:54.208
by my mum that I spent it to a school board and it had too much social comfort. We all

01:42:54.374 --> 01:43:08.328
know children aren't interested in politics. You should examine again the politics of any school.

01:43:15.835 --> 01:43:20.500
I think those sorts of stereotypes are very limiting and harmful.

01:43:26.386 --> 01:43:38.122
I wanted to speak before, but I don't know

01:43:26.386 --> 01:43:38.122
where to interview. Friends like them. I was very interested in the way we referred to the fact that the fantasy writer doesn't have an athlete like the science fiction writer and turns to children's fantasy. I also 
think there's another aspect here that there are some science fiction writers to write to children's books, but choose to write in fantasy when they write to the children, as you know that we do. She writes an

01:44:03.615 --> 01:44:21.756
excellent science fiction and speaking of herself as a writer, when I do write to children, I would really prefer to write in fantasy because I want you to strip away the pseudo-philosophical pretensions of science 
fiction. the mind game and all that goes with it and bring it down to children's fiction itself. It's very restrictive. I see. To try and do science fiction at a lower level, you think, is not really on. Because once the

01:44:38.862 --> 01:44:44.251
ideas have to lose their complexity, they lose their interest. Yes, quite. And I think that's why there is not as much good science fiction. Yes, quite. I think there are some ideas which are, at the same time, simple 
and mind-boggling. The book that I recommended, Highly the Mousson, His Child, is very much concerned with the idea of infinity. It's a beautiful book, really marvellous. Do you think we've got a right to

01:45:13.643 --> 01:45:22.032
counter-casual children's literature? I'm afraid maybe that that's a stupid name because you obviously read it. I like the German

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:36.609
language. It's more or less just plain fancy literature. Oh, no, that's what I was talking about today, but I am interested in old books that come out with a puffin on its cover or a dragon on, you know. In fact, that's how 
it happens often. People submit a manuscript into their surprise to get a letter saying it's been referred to the children's editor. What are the issues with textbooks? There were two of them in America. That's

01:46:03.273 --> 01:46:05.457
right. That's right, yeah. And it's gone the other way too. There are some, I think there was one prize winning book, I think by Rue Mcgarden recently, that appeared as an adult novel in America, and as a children's book 
in England. It shows how often. But it goes the other way too, right?

01:46:39.959 --> 01:46:41.461
Well, there probably were, you see. It's just a publicly wondrous meeting, how much complexity children enjoy.

01:46:58.808 --> 01:47:02.873
I was going to ask you about talking down. Would you imagine that somebody who's been writing books for adults and consciously tries to write them for a child probably does what you're suggesting, which is underage, 
in terms of complexity? Yeah, quite so. I would swear to that. I actually invite the students in my course who are third and fourth year students to write stories, if they want to, children stories for their

01:47:28.745 --> 01:47:45.302
assignments.

01:47:45.704 --> 01:48:07.375
Yeah, I think that the degree of self-consciousness is... Might be

01:47:45.704 --> 01:48:07.375
going across.

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:14.526
Yeah, because it's easy to, you know, for an established author to run a sort of fairly high-minded line like C.S. Lewis does, you know, he says, oh, what happens is you want to write a book, you write it, and you find that 
it's come out a children's book, you know. I think that's a bit rubbishy, actually, because at least the Narnia books are among the most talking-down books that I know. And I mean, I think they're very good, but they're

01:48:30.642 --> 01:48:34.005
also extremely patronizing. The children don't mind it. I carefully

01:48:37.882 --> 01:49:04.530
avoided actually drawing any lines because I wouldn't know how to do it myself.

01:49:06.265 --> 01:49:18.970
Well, if there are a lot of better questions, I'm really going to end this

01:49:06.265 --> 01:49:18.970
here. Thank you for a very interesting talk.

01:49:32.725 --> 01:49:54.112
All in all,

01:49:32.725 --> 01:49:54.112
I was delighted to see that due to the strain and the work that you've been doing over the program, I just hope that that's the part of the way. Most unfortunately, that's what we would do. Definitely. I'm not sure. A lot. 
So I appreciate it, Adelaide. And thank you for your credit. And all the rest of your attention. Unfortunately,

01:50:02.054 --> 01:50:12.971
unfortunately, the show must go on and it must remain now contributed to its memory. So, that's what we're going to do. I'm going to play the first thing.

01:50:44.410 --> 01:50:56.002
Commonly

01:50:44.410 --> 01:50:56.002
experienced by general practitioners in the finance department. Depends on the diet of someone.

01:51:04.792 --> 01:51:07.735
But, as a legal researcher, I must find out.

01:51:13.418 --> 01:51:20.607
the supernatural vampire, which you must agree has such little creed, it's quite impossible. These are things that myth and legend grossly distorted by, oh yes, first life tonight. Lights, please, spots out. Now, 
this is what you might call a traditional vampire. I'm glad to be here. Pennsylvania needs you.

01:51:42.832 --> 01:51:44.013
Now focus too. Anyway, there you are. Typical cave. The work for teeth. A definitely nasty piece of work, but unfortunately the facts have been distorted in time. Ah, but the answer's come clearer with you apply a 
little medical science to the man. Traditionally, man fires spend very evil lives, commit suicide, or even than they were known to. And right in the day, with an actual fact, medical science proved slightly

01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:18.658
otherwise. Vampirin, obviously a disease, transmitted more than a million months of population. In fact, it won't be described as an entire process. The vampire's course of deceit begins with a bit of it. And then 
the first symptoms had it off the set. He dies. He's not quite such a man, please. One may ask, why does the man die when, in fact, he apparently rose from the dead beginning? Now, it's as simple as he doesn't die. Now, it's

01:52:52.778 --> 01:52:57.303
your fact that for disease, obviously the metabolic process is quite severely. He tends to go into a comatose state, a deep comatose state, sufficient to be called to surrender animation. The Russians prefer to call 
such a state anabiosis, virtually without life in the Greek. Other terms are hyperbiosis or unlife. And the one I prefer is cryptobiosis, signal life. Because in fact, while apparently dead, it's alive. Now, the

01:53:24.931 --> 01:53:28.136
person in the cryptobiosis state, what does one do with it? So you put it on the turn, or a crypt, or in the grave. Now, the second symptoms have their onset. Basically, the Cumberdough State is not a permanent one. The 
person thinks the way back. Now,

01:53:43.674 --> 01:53:54.325
if a person wakes up from apparently a dead state and they've been buried, they're not going to get very far. Unless of course, as the one who lived, they come from the upper strata of society, where in fact they're not 
buried in the ground, but buried in tombs or crypts. They find the buried and they get out of here. So much with blue blood. Now, the other interesting features of this disease is it's not a simple disease. One would say

01:54:17.116 --> 01:54:19.559
it's like radiation, as it obviously is. We're going to see the central nervous system side effects. Psychotic mania.

01:54:28.272 --> 01:54:32.698
This is not quite a traditional vampire, but, you know, it's quite a certain group. You have psychosis coming from the effects on the nervous system. The other mechanism is by a rabdo type virus. which pursues the 
cause, very well pursuant to it. It moves into the liver and attacks one of the RNA or DNA cofactors. Preferably the liver because none of that goes by chemical in the liver. You can say anything about it. So you have

01:54:57.553 --> 01:55:05.082
these two diseases that work in concert that produce a single coherent system of symptoms.

01:55:07.508 --> 01:55:14.957
Now, a lot of the side effects of anything is, well, obviously the central nervous effects are quite severe. Traditionally, vampires are quelled by the power of the cross. Obviously, monsters. But, if you think 
about it, a devil's central nervous system is bound to, what do you think? So, you would get things like intense morbid phobias of religious symbols. So, fear of the cross. Possibly also fear of consecrated ground.

01:55:42.024 --> 01:55:44.508
Are we waiting for this? Additionally, as for things like running water, obviously a bit. Once, of course, they're disorientated so severely they can't swim. Other side effects are quite interesting. The vampire, 
because he spends so much time in a crypto-biotics state, has his life span extended quite considerably. So in fact, you get the apparent longevity of the vampire. And

01:56:06.875 --> 01:56:15.828
the other interesting effects is that the vampire is produced, is brought into the state of actual hysterical strength. Hysterical strength is one of the most curious cases where the attainment of mouse-wives who 
involved in the color accident and had a child trapped underneath the smarged car are quite capable of picking up and moving a car. It usually weighs about a tonne. Normally they end up with a lot of problems before it's

01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:36.038
ended up with butts. These creatures live in a state of perpetual hysterical strength. Their metabolic states are greatly enhanced, so they're much more biologically efficient. And being much more biologically 
efficient, they become very difficult to kill. The mere simple wounds they've been killed. Ordinary people are effectual. It takes very massive wounds to destroy the environment. Therefore, decapitation is

01:56:59.227 --> 01:57:02.110
staking the heart. Because the disease is so pernicious, viruses will last for a long time, the only way to get rid of a vampire is to consume the power of that fire. The poor peasant vampires are presumably quite 
contained in very, you know, the second and the third side please. This tends to ram the point over a little too hard, I think. It does produce the effect of massive wounding. Um, what do you about the focus on that

01:57:30.946 --> 01:57:37.399
something? I'm using

01:57:37.419 --> 01:57:41.266
your hand now. Oh yes, that's good. Van Prism we can now see just simply. Oh yes, the others is interesting, but there are three theories about why they're going to pop up. One is the co-pact of fear which I mentioned. 
which is very nice because it explains why one is taking the oil, taking it for the matter. The situation is that what happens when blood is in the stomach is different because there's so many enzymes that act as an axis

01:58:00.245 --> 01:58:07.634
and the blood is simply congealed. So why do they leave blood? The co-fact is a simple molecule easily taken in The other one is the hemolytic fear. This one assumes that the blood can be cut in out of the hemolytic canal, 
which is injected all over it. The third one is super psychological again. Blood has got so many coronations in life. The person who finds that he periodically dies, he obviously needs more life. So how do we go out and

01:58:37.541 --> 01:58:39.765
draw blood? The adaptions of being a vampire are quite severe. Many people can't stand this training. The ones in the base of that could survive longer. Also, a simple adaption to survive. This is the director, 
regional anti-vampire control. We're not law enforcement activities. Attack and destroy the vampire now.

01:59:17.579 --> 01:59:42.040
So

01:59:17.579 --> 01:59:42.040
much

01:59:17.579 --> 01:59:42.040
for psychology.

01:59:44.082 --> 01:59:46.084
Where's our restaurant?

01:59:48.106 --> 01:59:55.374
Strike, but remember, only a massively destructive ruin can destroy a man. Stay and live. Watch out for the demonic

01:59:57.637 --> 02:00:17.320
strength

01:59:57.637 --> 02:00:17.320
of the man.

02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:22.742
Right, next slide, please.

02:00:25.906 --> 02:00:31.935
This is where we really

02:00:25.906 --> 02:00:31.935
go off the ground. Next slide, please. This is moving up the date. Next slide. Protections and things to come. Obviously, the human future lies in space. This is a viewing next slide, please.

02:00:53.075 --> 02:01:04.458
Yes, moving right

02:00:53.075 --> 02:01:04.458
along, hollow type module. Next

02:01:04.999 --> 02:01:09.227
please. You've got to bang through all these clothes quickly. Just keep banging away. Oh, I love that. Ah, the good old moon. A nice dead wall. Brutal activity going on. A few odd things about it, though. But for the mass 
cons, isn't it? A nice wall. A little different. Change of scenery. Continue working. Ah, this is what we hope to be doing. Well, if you'd like to try it. Continue.

02:01:37.642 --> 02:01:39.585
Now, this is moving out a little further. It's a new real estate. I think it's a cool production. Not as far as project demos, of course. American stuff, NASA. A couple of loads of Mars. Please continue. Same again, 
going down. Actually, that's a Viking. I think

02:01:55.989 --> 02:02:02.839
I'm on a machine, I think.

02:02:09.046 --> 02:02:10.667
abstract out as bones or not. This of course is Phobos, the moon, planets Mars. Interesting planet, very low pressure, lots and lots of dust, a lot of the weather is controlled by energy getting into that dust. Quite 
interesting stuff. That's why it rises, absorbs heat energy, jumps about the place. Continue.

02:02:32.328 --> 02:02:32.628
A blank. Any old common old garden asteroid being visited by earthlings. Continue.

02:02:42.408 --> 02:02:43.061
Ah, yes. Venus. Very, very good if we'd done this one. Not quite as it would look, but, uh, optically that is. Uh, this would probably be completely blacked out. Um, one more thing, pointy thing, like, finger. 
Lightning would do it. If you assume this was taken in infrared, this has got a surface temperature around one moment. About 700 degrees cold, and that'd be about 450 degrees, say, uh, centigrade. Quite warm.

02:03:10.710 --> 02:03:14.355
Atmospheric pressure, how to guess, is about 60 atmospheres. A lot of difficulties. A yank classified this, we classified it as pyrolysis, which means hot and deep. Always hot and deep. That must be like plastic or 
interesting stuff, optically being quite wild. Because of any light that we've been through quite some peculiar rain was in fact, uh, important you're going to see, but if you imagine a surface of a spear like a ball

02:03:31.210 --> 02:03:56.794
and a light ray coming down, instead of going straight down to the surface as would a normal light ray in an atmosphere like ours, it would be quite severely instead of landing at the point where it came straight in at, it 
would land somewhere on the other side, sort of to a view point, except it wouldn't make it. Go out and then that is the side. If anything, we're living in a planet like that, I'd have to use a sonar type system, as would

02:03:59.678 --> 02:04:07.449
things like Dolphin Oceanic, which is, continue please.

02:04:10.233 --> 02:04:14.219
That one's going to come first, that's Venus all the way, please continue. Jump it up, continue. This is how the solar system sat in, this one came out beautifully. How's focus going on the menu? Yeah, it is, isn't it? 
Okay, time on. Stacked down again, on Titan, setting off seismic charges. Absolutely beautiful. Here we come from on my projection, not to worry. I sat down again, that looked better. Nice stuff. Good to know.

02:04:38.326 --> 02:04:39.850
Seventh planet of the solar system. This planet has had a bad deal from science fiction. There are no great science fiction stories throughout Uranus. Continue. Neptune's had a better deal. It's mentioned in a 
couple. Actually, that's why Uranus is a better deal. It's got about five moons. I've all got beautiful Latin names. Whereas Neptune's got two tritons and a myriad. Continue. This is where we get out into the world.

02:05:10.199 --> 02:05:11.221
Uh, so to speak. Fact. Stars continue with you. Just hammer away. This is where science fiction is going to go. Oh, no. Uh, some of these are quite... That is North America, would you believe? No. It is. I shall 
demonstrate if I had a long pointy thing, which I don't. Oh, you... What do you believe is the Gulf of Mexico, if you could say so? No, I don't. Downes are everywhere, but not so worried. Continue, please. Some of these

02:05:43.988 --> 02:05:45.650
are incredibly beautiful. The focus is, that's the horse head nebula. A horse head. Continue. Andromeda, of course. Anyone can recognize the andromeda glance. It's only one and a half million light years away. So 
it's a long walk. This is called the dumbbell nebula in Volpeka. Dumb bells. Continue. That is the crap they've gone. Absolutely swishable piece of work. It keeps a lot of boffins busy because it's got all sorts of nice

02:06:13.103 --> 02:06:16.408
things going on in there. Lots of hot gas. A pulsar in there which is probably a neutron star. I haven't written an essay on it earlier this year, I should know. These are stars, except that we've got square things. 
Continue. Another galaxy. Very sweet. Continue. I

02:06:31.964 --> 02:06:37.232
would say Smudgey Starfleet. That'd be... That's a Nebula. Nebula's gas. Gasiest bodies filled with... This is called the Rosetta Nebula in Manosaurus. It's an absolutely beautiful figure. It was in focus. It's 
really small. Continue, please. Uh, not a typical nebula, as you might find anywhere in the universe. Ah, oh, whatever. Now this, this is the plight of the seven sisters, which if you get a clear enough night you can see

02:07:02.817 --> 02:07:08.428
twenty-one. These are blue stars, they're quite hot, they've only got a life expectancy of mere few million years, so they'll blow out beautifully in the night quite soon. If you hang around long enough you'll see 
them go. Right, that's also incredibly beautiful in focus. Another typical galaxy, galaxies are quite interesting. It looks very much like you'd have in life anywhere in in the universe, you have to have galaxies.

02:07:32.024 --> 02:07:39.154
So if you move to another universe somewhere, and it hasn't got galaxies, your chance of finding any life there are pretty miserable. Especially intelligent life. There's a beautiful paper, a scientific paper, 
mind you. It's quite technical. It proves that the universe is like what we see because we happen to be here. Because we live in a universe that's got galaxies, and it's isotopically distributed. It means that it

02:07:55.979 --> 02:08:01.489
happens to be intelligently in such a universe who can look out and say, huh, why are we here? And the answer is because we're in a universe that's us, traumically distributed, and it's got galaxies. That's the answer, 
kids. And I published a paper out of it, too. Bloody. Anyway, continue, please. This is a nice quick trip. Oh, right. I mean, yes. That's something which I can't remember. Timmy Slott. Continue, please. Ah, now we're

02:08:24.082 --> 02:08:25.966
really ruining the fight alone. This is a man going on a long slay trip. Would you believe it? Continue. He's got some men. Actually, this is, I think, literally. It's one of the interesting ones. A blue-white dwarf 
star and a large red giant. No theoretical reason to not wash your system light. Very funny. That one is either zeta-alguri or zeta-canstripe. It's alguri, remember? Continue. This is a squish. This is a

02:08:56.057 --> 02:09:01.103
hypothetical planet that is around a star that has gone nova. and in fact the bright bit is the number and the black chamber red stuff is the planetary nebula formant. This planet would be hypothetically about the 
position of our planet Pluto in our solar system. Continue. Now this, of course, is beta-wire relying on its side. These slides were dropped earlier in the evening, and the great changes are going to be missing, and

02:09:18.309 --> 02:09:28.842
it's been a bit difficult putting them all together again in a hurry. Beta-wire is a nice binary star. It's sufficiently close for there to be an exchange of gases. between the two stars, and because this tends to spin 
out, you have to spin because they're turning on one another, and you get this spiral coming out. It must be a really fabulous sight. Pity is, present theory says there's not much chance of them being planets, but then

02:09:47.306 --> 02:09:54.076
again, we might not take the present theories yet. Continue.

02:09:57.220 --> 02:09:58.883
Now this is zeta cancerite. Obviously, a rather miserable place. Continue.

02:10:07.570 --> 02:10:09.254
Ah, that's where they went. That's Mercury lying on the side. That is a Mercury mountain. That is a solar sun. And that is a Mercury plane. Continue. Ah, yes. Now this one is interesting because this is one of your common 
organic hypothetical planets going around for Centauri. This one is a real pity about the focus because, very fascinatingly enough, there is a constellation up here, that constellation, which we see in our skies

02:10:27.794 --> 02:10:37.955
and call Cassiopeia. In fact, On the planet going around Alpha Centauri, the stars will be very much as we see them, in the constellations. Except in this case, there is a seventh star. It's our sun. People suggested 
that this constellation, as seen from the Centauri planets, should be called the switchblade. Actually, Stephen Dole called that. Let's check away, if you want to call that. Probably the Vicious America, which he

02:11:00.349 --> 02:11:01.752
is. The Vicious Barclay is America. Continue. It gets even groovy as we go along. Yes. Here is one of your common old guys. Planets with intelligent life. It's not one of ours. Because a Brit painted this damn thing, 
you've got a Jottelbank type telescope, and you have an alien spacecraft taking off. Actually, there's an alien city and things down here, too. Ha-ha, of course. A PMG tower, GPO type tower, London. Hmm. How much

02:11:31.619 --> 02:11:33.000
imaginations are we going? Continue. Ah, now we can get on extra-terrestrial life. That is a sort of primordial depiction of extra-terrestrial life. Didn't you, man, the suspects look beautiful. Ah, that looks 
almost too focused. That is like a galaxy as seen from a planet. Don't run a star along with Hulk from the galaxy, as one can guess. You have your great, ruddy, great galaxy here, and these things here are the other stars.

02:12:03.552 --> 02:12:09.327
Perhaps one would say a globular cluster moving outside the galaxy. Of course, there's a pretty high velocity start. This means they travel a couple hundred kilometers per second that are moving out of the galaxy, so 
they might have moved out and evolved life. Continue. Now, this is getting really aiding and aiding in life. This is a planet where there's great masses of carbon tetrachloride. That's a glob of carbon tetrachloride

02:12:29.610 --> 02:12:32.174
going up, or an alien. There's more gobs of carbon tetrachloride than an alien. A moon on some description. And, of course, obviously, as you've all guessed by now, this is a star inside probably a glob, a globular 
cluster, like that. Inside globular clusters, stars are sufficiently close to you within white months of one another. which means that if there are any civilizations out there, they would have a great chance to get

02:12:50.009 --> 02:12:59.363
around and form galactic empires. Because it would be quite easy to build interstellar space systems that can get out there. It will start as only a few light months away as opposed to light years. The only trouble is, 
the good guesses are, bombular clusters are old, which means they didn't have the heavy elements that we've got. That's to say, elements heavy in iron, uranium, cobalt, nickel. They probably couldn't form a machine

02:13:24.626 --> 02:13:27.412
civilization since we could. But they might struggle along with plastics and there is a lot of things you can do with biology. You can put rockers to go on. Yes, I would. If you can guess this one, you're good biologists. 
They'll go off with not so much a bang, but a... other musiating sound. Continue. Ah, yes. More extraterrestrial life. I guess. The next one, please. Oh, wrong one. These are typical pieces of extraterrestrial life.

02:13:58.166 --> 02:14:00.128
One of your typical Niven puppeteers. The properties are quite interesting. I thought they seemed to be quite acceptable form of alien life, except there are some nasty things about them from a biological point of 
view. I mean, apart from the fact that you've got these eyes on the end of these arms. The idea of a mouth as an organ manipulation is very good. I must grant the difference showing the incredible, the good originality in

02:14:18.010 --> 02:14:22.135
doing that. The three legs are a real foul up though. There are other problems involved. Basically, reproduction. Niven is very coy about the reproduction of puppeteers. And if you try to work out how they do it, it's 
no wonder he's so coy about it. He implies that they are females of the species of a non-sentient. Actually, I wonder about Larry Niven because they're chisindy. or zinty as one might say. Presumably it's supposed to

02:14:53.663 --> 02:15:03.854
pronounce the K but unfortunately because he used a letter like K which is silenced in a lot of uses, I tend to suppress his K. So I say zinty. Actually there is a CZ sound in some of the European languages which would be 
pronounced Cha, which would be pronounced Chinty, or if you accent Dutch and pull a ka, it becomes Kinty. So much for Larry Niven. We're going to rip some great chunks out of him later on. But anyway, as I said, oh yes,

02:15:20.353 --> 02:15:22.556
non-sentient. Because obviously the brain must get in the way if you've got to have a womb in there somewhere, so they've got to be non-sentient. Anyway, non-sentient female sex, that sounds suspicious to me. 
Obviously a hang-up somewhere. Continue. This is where they go off. Crazy cells, folks. Get out of the way, will you? Next slide, please. You're kidding, of course. Now I'm singing the song. This to give you some

02:15:53.741 --> 02:15:57.326
irritation is a mammal. You're, of course, sniggering it for the wrong reasons, because, biologically speaking, mammals I'm all equipped with these. Well, gentlemen, try to look down there best and check on them. 
In actual fact, mammals aren't mammals, not because they've got boobs, but because they've got hair. See? We can't see that slide. Now, interestingly

02:16:20.252 --> 02:16:29.721
enough, there's no biological reason why you couldn't have a species. In fact, when the males didn't have mammary glands, And in fact, looking at what happens at the pre-cellular level, where you can, in fact, do some 
interesting evolutionary experimental work on raw biochemical, which has been done, I mean, this is the first time you're going to hear it, folks. I mean, you know, John Poitzner said last night on television that

02:16:46.384 --> 02:16:55.257
science fiction was only 30 years behind science, behind everything you catch up. One could have memory miles. Continue, please. Thanks for the memory. This is one of your other biologically interesting things. 
The ancients in their way tended to mug up these creatures. Like, do you want antroops, so to say, all antroops? In other words, a bird man. A man with wings who flies. Very unsound. unstable. But we also do a sort of thing

02:17:20.567 --> 02:17:23.270
to, ah yes, spin your birds. It was once pointed out to me that in the Edgar Wright horror story, the Martians must all be reptiles when they were reproduced by eggs. Therefore, there's no need for the birds to have 
boobs. So, all those busty birds, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. In fact, they're a fake. Oh, my God. Edgar Rice borrows his imagination and is working overtime for the wrong reasons.

02:17:53.131 --> 02:17:54.613
Continue. Now, this is beautiful. Now, everyone knows that science fiction writes his own science fiction. What they don't realise is that science writes his own science fiction too. Now, this is what one would call 
a communal garden. This is your Photon rocket work on a simple principle that you have a really great type of light down here somewhere and you square out lots of light and it moves forward in the opposite direction. A

02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:20.491
typically spot by there. Next slide please. A technical diagram on Aepoponics, which the numbers haven't come out yet. Now this... Ooh, bloody hell.

02:18:34.792 --> 02:18:37.475
This is a reflective dish. Engines... Oh, bugger us. There's a little shuttle rocket. Life support unit up there somewhere, and a long thin thing for supporting it all. Now the photo on rocket is a nice idea. Anyone can 
look at the calculations and they can show you that a photo on rocket will get very close to the velocity while therefore it won't take advantage of all the little ballistic effects like time dilation. The fact that the

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:05.406
rocket gets shorter, actually that's why. Because it means you can invent problems for physics students which say, how can you get a parachute through a pair of barn doors? It doesn't boom that fast enough. And it 
shrinks down and it hits through the barn doors. You must admit, there's some beautiful realistic problems. There's one published in the Australian in which some guy worked out as follows. Cinderella goes to the

02:19:27.616 --> 02:19:31.481
ball on the far side, which of course is only a wide hour away from Europe. Midnight she's got to leave the ball so she takes off fast. In a non-accelerating graphic, acceleration cars can't go in. that troubles back to 
Europe. Now the thing that does seem to have made it back in time before the witching hour on Earth, her time, I'm going to say, was she turned into a pumpkin? First, she turned into a pumpkin. Second, one she had to

02:19:50.195 --> 02:19:52.458
squintle. Sinners were much better as a pumpkin. Next slide. Oh, no. Right. This is an absolutely beautiful slide, which is on a photon rocket that has come to has arrived in a pantry system that is a mere thirty-one 
years away from the Trippin nebula, which has always colored stuff down here. An absolutely beautiful piece of nebula, it's an absolutely beautiful piece of work. I'll give a plug for the books that came from too.

02:20:21.601 --> 02:20:24.725
Continue, please. I'm chatting about that. Ha-ha-ha! Put it right there. This is good stuff.

02:20:46.795 --> 02:20:47.657
Right. A common organ, born to King Arthur style. What does one do? Naturally, one turns the exorcist. Nothing to worry about. Science has taken a hand. Well, naturally we just wrote a copy, part of a copy of course, of 
an article from Physics Fortan, 1972. I think you're not, this is for real.

02:21:09.725 --> 02:21:13.491
It can be quite easy to find out because it has got very well known property. Praying the contract through wall sticker and four inches of the lock once. It comes to this thing called quantum mechanics. And we can do a lot 
of things with quantum mechanics, but we'll see it in a little bit, too. Yes. OK, you have this. Anyway, here you're going to learn, you know, that quantum geometry idea is a wave mechanics. This established system,

02:21:35.903 --> 02:21:42.412
that's to say, it's going to go through walls bigger than 4 inches, or 0.1 meter. That's where his object, whose associated wave function was decreased to about 1. 2.7 got their full altitude at about one, about a tenth 
of a meter from the mound. And this establishes them quite easily, because you work out what the mass of a ghost is. And if it goes up to the bottom... about 10 to the minus 16 for neutrons. And that's about a mass of about 10

02:22:13.816 --> 02:22:17.021
to the minus 40 kilograms. They're quite light. Now, first of all, this, what happens? Any ghost can come down a dead body as they want to do. It's quite easily accelerated. In fact, the energy to accelerate a ghost to 
escape from it, If only we could change the moment's 38 jewels. In fact, any part of brief will accelerate a ghost, clean off the earth. In fact, even the sunlight will squeeze a ghost off the earth. So the only ghost

02:22:40.636 --> 02:22:49.108
we'll add to it are in fact a ghost that's trapped inside an old building, dungeon, gets down to speed, or get caught up in chains. And they're stuffed! Now, ghosts trapped in this unfortunate man are forced to remain, 
because after they've been brought up, they've all come out from Austin. They soon kind of rose to a steep rate. And then Max's increase. Max's going to get out. He's going back. So in fact, if you want to lay a goat on

02:23:08.275 --> 02:23:16.648
Max's side, what you're going to do is calm it down. It's not like it wasn't in an armored race. You're going to sit there and you're going to think about the car and Max will go in. You need to watch out for him. There's some 
nice side effects in this, which I can't go all that too unfortunately. But in actual fact, you all know what Peter Dunn said about Red Room Ghosts. In fact, this out here does it quite nicely. Because ghosts are

02:23:39.668 --> 02:23:46.154
wandering around the place, oh yeah, you get all sorts of interesting effects about the real inflection of visions of the surface of ghosts. It must be less than any percent or it might never be seen at all. and said, 
''Gus, can only be seen by poor illumination. You should be trying to plot that. I'm going to push you to get to the wall.'' I said, ''Go to the wall.'' I said, ''Go to the wall.'' I said, ''Go to the wall.'' I said, ''Go to

02:24:02.530 --> 02:24:04.274
the wall.'' I said, ''Go to the wall.'' I said, ''Go to the wall.'' The other little thing is about them is that they give you scatter radiation. And because, obviously, the parking is a great void out there, you have to 
see the fact that the scattering of shot by radiation by ghosts and flies to the universe with, well, therefore, a major source of cosmic radio noise. Attempts made so far were as strong as to explain this, and

02:24:25.732 --> 02:24:45.327
unfortunately, if they did too little account of the contribution...

02:24:25.732 --> 02:24:45.327
Also, obviously, the absolute temperature of our space is about 3 degrees celsius at stand fault, and 3 is mostly except 20 degrees. It's possible the reason ghosts are cold, because if something returns to them, 
it's very close. Obviously, the door is great. It's true. If this is going to be a certain thing, that was the ghost that actually pulled up the large, you know, velocity moment. Is that down to the energy in a couple of

02:25:02.205 --> 02:25:05.449
holes? Yes, it's rather like that thing. That record goes up to say that the ghost only walks. When it's not over here, that's in England, and when it's down here in Australia. That's got a fantastic timing, I tell you. 
But even so, ghosts, I guess there's some really, there's some really gassed up there. Because of their properties, it's possible that some might have certain figures. In other words, there are six differences in my

02:25:32.304 --> 02:25:34.147
mind. Imagine. Would you even be ghosts? It's okay. And this would be the asymmetric wave functions characterized by semi-guides for physics. Molecules are various and this is what happens in school. And the 
element of space would be one in which ghosts of opposite spin would be paired up to occupy the energy state of the moment, each carrying one state. This is a highly satisfactory disposition. Why do you have a

02:25:59.683 --> 02:26:02.007
physicist? Now, I think we've got to go on. This is a sort of wearing moment. What's next on the paper? Ah yes, there's more slides. I think it's more interesting to go along. Ah yes! This is going to be about the 
extraterrestrial stage, we're going to extraterrestrial technology. The stuff which you can build if you've got the brains to build them in time to do it in. Ah yes. This would be a typical monolith in orbit over a

02:26:35.207 --> 02:26:39.013
moon. I know it's dirty digits they are but not to worry

02:26:39.263 --> 02:26:50.828
about. I wouldn't talk too much. Now, Niven's ring, of course, was a beautiful thing. I mean, it makes lovely paintings of stars. But unfortunately, it's a lousy concept. I mean, okay, how do you build a ring? One 
thinks to oneself. One could, you know, actually a lot of tidal effects. Tidal effects are sort of easy to imagine. You just simply take a can of water, whirl it on it with a string, and... Steve, you could let it go rigid.

02:27:27.347 --> 02:27:32.700
In fact, a ring like that has to do things like staying rigid. The tidal effects are quite miserable. What do you know together is horrible? Next slide, please.

02:27:42.747 --> 02:27:43.649
It's a better idea. Simplicity is always best. Freeman Dyson's original idea was, see Dyson decided to basically sneak in to come think about it. If you want to reason out a problem, you do it in a nice, simple fashion. 
And he said, right, if there exists very large technologies in the universe, What are their upper limits? What can they gain? He talked about in terms of mass energy. Simple ideas. So he just simply said, right, let's

02:28:06.694 --> 02:28:09.176
take the mass of Jupiter. You can know what the mass of Jupiter is. And you take the output of the energy from the sun. And from those figures, you can work out something like... Dyson's speed. Except he didn't say, aha, 
he's got the Dyson's speed. He said, aha, and wrote it up in science and got published. It's fine. Actually Dyson's an interesting bloke, Diagress. He's only got a PhD. In ordinary degree, no honours degree at all, and

02:28:29.323 --> 02:28:36.694
he's a proper Princeton. He must be a damn bright bugger. Anyway, to continue with the Dyson route, what he did was he just simply considered if you smeared out all the mass of Jupiter into a thin sphere. A sphere is 
wrong, it's actually a thin shell, about two metres thick, which means the man could stand upright and put his feet on one side and bang his head on the other. a funny thing to do. When people wrote in and said, aha, you

02:29:00.676 --> 02:29:07.746
build a thing like this around the stone with four parts, because of tidal effects, he said, aha, of course you're right. So what he said is you have a lot of these things floating around the place like this, which is a 
ready-built cylinder, no less. And if you say that this cylinder is about a mile in diameter, say 10 miles long, which allows the sensors to go, if you say it's 10 miles long and about 20 miles long, you're probably

02:29:12.994 --> 02:29:21.346
better off. A thing like that, you can fill up knowing, you know, it's just diabolically easy, just put it on layers. Now let's see, what is the area of a thing like that? It's obviously about something like 2 pi r by L 
long. That's what you'd say it's here to do. Well, let's see, what's that we're going to weigh? It's about 10 miles diameter. It's about 5 miles, that's about... It's 30, if it's about 20 long, 600 square miles of one

02:29:43.657 --> 02:29:50.628
level. And if you move the levels in, you admittedly lose your surface area, but you gain a lot. If you thought about spinning an object like this over the outer layer with centrifugal force, which would throw you out 
because it's spinning around, you had an internal force of One gravity. As you work in the center, you have lesser gravities. Where you can, in fact, install lots of machinery. Things like park lanes, for example, if

02:30:18.999 --> 02:30:22.363
you wanted to build on that side. It would be damned interesting to have a park, you know, like a great open park, like a forest, built artificially, inside a cylinder. Where, in fact, you had conditions of 10 
gravities. I mean, marvelous, in fact, technically flying through trees. That's what I've idea of, though. I like it. Continue.

02:31:00.775 --> 02:31:03.867
Powerful gunner on the motor. The building had a single... What a man! Yes, it's Superman! A strange figure from another planet who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and 
abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who

02:31:19.079 --> 02:31:20.180
came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers

came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work with powers and abilities. A man who came to work You can break down exactly

02:31:34.947 --> 02:32:00.128
what he

02:31:34.947 --> 02:32:00.128
does

02:31:34.947 --> 02:32:00.128
and work out how he has to do it.

02:32:04.833 --> 02:32:05.514
Right! He can bend the steel bars and he can screw it to anything he wants. He can set them up so he can make full tools in the single band. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work 
half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work

02:32:20.892 --> 02:32:21.413
half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work 
half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He can work half of them. He Now, I said I'd take pictures out of Mary Hill and I will. Mary Hill and I have a very

02:32:37.188 --> 02:32:39.815
cool thing about this man. He called it, Mary was a dear woman of cleanliness. Tissue. Tissue, baby. Ah, Tissue, then. That's good. Right. I thought that this was a superman. He was too strong, too powerful. He would 
tend to rip a female apart if he was cockulating with it. He would ejaculate at loose transonic velocities and punch holes in it. Superhuman power being more powerful in locomotives would tear away through a delicate

02:33:01.833 --> 02:33:09.582
body and leave a preference to sit. But you then undergo I think on that one for a while.

02:33:33.308 --> 02:33:41.239
Now, including the fact that the man is stupid and he's a human or a young, he's noticeably human. Okay,

02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:53.617
Rose! Give it back! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leave trial buildings at a single bound. It's Superman! Yes, it's Superman! Strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and 
abilities far beyond those immortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, then steal in his bare hands. And who disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great Metropolitan

02:34:21.034 --> 02:34:30.568
newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice, and the American... Now, when you think you need food, get a phone number and say, oh, the master is cooking, I should be saying that. That's not a master 
menu, that's like more. That's like one of those cakes and we never thought we'd want to go to the supermarket. Yes, we want to go to the grocery store. Now we go to the grocery store. Well, those of you who saw the program

02:34:51.878 --> 02:34:57.306
Mr. Terrific, this is about a punitive or reticule clay field. And for one hour, you have the strength of a thousand men. Great stuff. Now, if you care to sit down and work out howl, but the relative weight of a man who had 
the strength of a thousand men on the ground, you know, the traction down to his planks, He said, well, come around here, there's a thousand times stronger water here. What? Go out and look the way for the sign. You're

02:35:15.252 --> 02:35:16.554
working on every way of a man. And you multiply the current stroke by, you divide it by a thousand. And you're going to go out and look the way for the sign. You're working on every way of a man. And you multiply the current 
stroke by, you divide it by a thousand. And you're going to go out and look the way for the sign. And you're working on every way of a man. So, give me the answer now. So, Ryan, just give us the basic unit. They work on it. An

02:35:32.979 --> 02:35:34.441
empty unit, and this is the terrific unit. One. It's kind of worth a thousand minutes. So, obviously, how about two minutes? So, so, two, three, and two. Obviously, no problem. Now, let's face it, right back to 
Blackmore. Blackmore stars. Four of you, I think. That's Blackmore stars. Now, we're thinking it's really a neutron star. A typical neutron star would be to take the mass of the Sun and compress the mass of the Sun to

02:35:55.227 --> 02:36:01.016
the Earth. It's about the mass of the Sun. It's pretty massive. Now, what's the mass of the Sun in mid-Earth? Look at both gasmobbies. One of the useful facts about this thing. And it said, Sun, you've got 333,500 times 
the mass of the Earth. Therefore, krypton is a word, a neutron plant, that's a saying. A neutron starts to evolve far enough to be like a planet, you know, cool north and quiet and down a bit. There's a planet. We need to be

02:36:28.835 --> 02:36:32.379
like a planet, not a star anymore. You've got to set the gravity back to three. Twenty-one hundred and thirty-three thousand and five hundred times the gravity of this whole universe. First light, please. Kill us 
once, Mr. Barger.

02:36:50.189 --> 02:37:12.045
So take the slide after this one, not

02:36:50.189 --> 02:37:12.045
the one before

02:36:50.189 --> 02:37:12.045
it.

02:37:13.915 --> 02:37:17.399
Yes.

02:37:17.419 --> 02:37:18.461
You know what I'm saying, don't you? Superman in Australia. Now in the comic, if I remember the sort of stuff, they never bothered to rationalise how Superman works. Which was neat, as you could sort of say, right? No 
way of knowing. The comic should have been cooked on. He's got all these superpowers, and that's it. But they got to work and they said, like, how does he work, you know? I said, Krypton's got a red sun, therefore the

02:37:39.388 --> 02:37:44.214
Kryptonians don't have superpowers and things like that. And he's got to be activated by yellow suns, and he's like, it's, you know, it's obviously no suns. I mean, Krypton, like, how does Kryptonite work? It looks 
like a radioactive element, but they've no Kryptonite in the universe. I mean, it's mountains, actually. But we shall fly on. But that's my idea. I don't know if I've been up to this. This is a good view of what you can get

02:38:02.903 --> 02:38:08.649
at. Right. Their explanation for his suit, we hear most certainly comes from a heavier planet. We established it comes from a planet which we can say has got 300,000 times more gravity. See, it can't be a planet. It's 
nonsense. I mean, Jupiter's only got a surface gravity of about, oh, about 4G or something. I mean, you know, four times stronger, you know, great stuff, fast, fast. If that's not bending steel bars in your band, I'd

02:38:30.130 --> 02:38:32.893
say, Storm bits of wire, yes, must be there. Right. But sons, obviously monsters, monsters, we'll come to that. Funny things. Yes, right. It's true. If it comes from a planet that's 300,000 times more massive as it 
goes, it serves very 300,000 times out of the earth, it has to be stronger. Not only is it going to be stronger, it has to be made tougher. Because otherwise, if you were on crypto, on crypto, it would be flattened. You

02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:04.062
know, very thin paste. All over the planet, sir. In fact, you can work out that on a neutron star, if you drop something like a small coin, in fact, it will liberate about as much energy as you have a small nuclear weapon.

02:39:22.604 --> 02:39:26.192
But I think that makes certain assumptions, which I haven't had a chance to go into. A paper where he can trip over on Cripple and survive, which means he can survive very powerful explosions and bullets and all sorts of 
things. Super speed becomes easy because he falls 300,000 times faster. That means bloody fast reflexes between the entire nervous system is speeded up. In fact, you would think 300,000 times faster than ordinary

02:39:46.555 --> 02:39:49.700
men. And if you had a nervous system comparable to ours, you'd be smart because you can think longer and faster. That means if you take an hour to solve a problem and take a human being, 300,000 man hours to think about it. 
X-ray vision. This one's almost easy, actually, because the optical tunneling effects of lasers are not looking at X-rays. His eyes are working like lasers. Now, if it's quite possible to think that he lives on a

02:40:15.626 --> 02:40:18.450
neutron star, we'll always gather it. Optical effects become quite weird. So it would be quite natural for the inhabitants to develop eyes that would, in fact, be able to project. Well, quite likely, so why not? I mean 
it's there physically, I mean the biology must take advantage of it somewhere. And let's see what happens. One of these other superpants flies. Now, flies are a funny thing, but we can get around that quite instantly.

02:40:43.268 --> 02:40:55.848
Now, all these big biological systems, creatures like men, animals, and dogs, and zebras and monkeys, this and that, whatever you like to call it. Biological evolution has to go on. It's got to go on in a gravitational 
field that is 300,000 times stronger than us. Matter doesn't behave like that unless you invent something rather smart. And so, I invented a k-effect. I told the k-effect because I was too much to call it the jacarice

02:41:11.890 --> 02:41:15.635
effect. Anyway,

02:41:15.655 --> 02:41:23.364
back to the k-effect. The k-effect is one of the hypothetical effects which means that It stores up lots and lots of energy and it overcomes effects on very strong gravitational fields so that matter can behave as if it 
were not in a strong gravitational field. Immediately, the planet can evolve. You can have ordinary biological evolution and by converging evolution you can get humanoids. Kryptonians, in other words. So,

02:41:50.092 --> 02:41:54.683
Krypton exploded, bang. Newtron stars, we don't know what exploded, they exploded. We might get the occasional odd, straight, interesting elements, like kryptonite with a K effect. Now, with the K effect, we have a 
lot of interesting things to consider. Now this means that Superman has got stored up in himself and all four of his energy. And this energy can be used quite simply. It means, in fact, that by him to survive on the Earth,

02:42:14.673 --> 02:42:25.264
I mean he can... I mean, the point of fact, an ordinary man can leap quite readily into the Earth at a velocity of 1 meter per second. He would leap into the Earth at a velocity of about 300 kilometers per second. Actually, 
it's 333. But this means it's about 30 times faster than he expected us to live the Earth. Which means he could hop around the pantry system quite happily. Which means he can really travel, but he's not really moving

02:42:40.262 --> 02:42:43.205
yet. With a K-field, he could do all the interesting stuff. A K-field would be a perfect safe gap for whatever he does. Now, the K-field, on the other hand, must be a response modulated. Which means that whenever it runs 
up in use, it modulates to overcome. which means that in fact, he doesn't rip doors off a panel unless he needs to. It's when he leans on things, the response comes back for them to be rather human. This means he is

02:43:11.707 --> 02:43:13.812
virtually perfectly elastic. Elastic in the true physical sense. A claimant goes back to its original shape. Plastic means you take something you need to form it and it remains conformed. Whereas elastic means that 
if it's in a certain state shape, and you bash it, bang it, or jump on it, it returns to that original state. Perfectly elastic. It's invulnerable. Right, so we've got an invulnerable map. In fact, he can be just merely

02:43:34.312 --> 02:43:39.318
invulnerable on the view that he has super strength. Because, you know, if you fix a car, it's up there. And the car is saying, ah, you should be crushed to death. But the old cave effect is working way same. Right. We keep 
pumping in the energy and keeping him in the same state. He would appear to be super strong. Because, in fact, all it's doing is he remains in the same state. The car can't fall because it gets in the way. And the cave field

02:43:56.058 --> 02:43:59.282
keeps pumping in the energy and keep him in the same state. Uninterested speculation. Yes. Now, once we've got the kaiting effect there, the kaiting, well, one, the effect so we associate a field with it and get away 
with explaining it. There's actually a thing called whatless power, which one finds about. Whatless power is interesting. It means you can pump energy in your system and the whatless power doesn't do anything. It

02:44:21.288 --> 02:44:22.350
just sort of vanishes. But you can take it out again as though it's there. So in fact the k-effect works like what was power. People are not setting the signs for what was power, which I won't go into, because they tend to 
get rather confusing. But effectively, with a k-field, and the socio-k-effect, you can do most of the things. But obviously k-fields must have other side effects. And this is where kryptonite comes in. It's

02:44:46.451 --> 02:44:48.034
obviously affected by radiation. Now, when it comes in contact with kryptonite radiation, it obviously does something that is K-field. It obviously draws energy back in the wrong direction. What do you do? Aha! 
We're getting somewhere. Very kryptonite. Probably something to start with. Radiation obviously interferes with something. Now, a K-field must store information. It must also, right? Superman is so big, so

02:45:07.827 --> 02:45:10.772
tall, so such is actually right. Now this radiation seeps in and it mucks up the information. So the right superman is 264. He's got two numbers. Bang! He's in trouble again. Right, that's very good to know. That's the 
other stuff I'm not going to bother about that. But you get the tip of the idea. Maybe an activation effect by stellar spectra. Red suns were stark. Red suns are interesting. As far as I figure out, E.C. don't have a red

02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:35.781
sun. And it inhibited the K effect, as one might imagine. All the plutonics would cure that. So obviously, the effect of a red sun must jam the spectral, must jam the level of the K thing. So in fact, the superman would 
really fly in the past. a great sun. It's kind of filled with jam at that level for a while, I guess. So, in fact, you couldn't really even fly around. And if you were up in the earth in a jam, ah, yeah. Yeah, don't cook the

02:46:05.663 --> 02:46:07.427
night's easy. It just simply jabs the input and output of energy. He's stuck. No superpowers in this. Go on. No worries, permanently jammed. Poisoning effects, right. Very awesome there. Okay, question for you. 
What have I left out? Brain. I'm Eugene Gray. Why? Why? Why the dope? I know. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans.

02:46:29.046 --> 02:46:29.407
Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. 
Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans.

02:46:38.056 --> 02:46:38.416
Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. 
Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans. Destroy his plans.

02:46:46.465 --> 02:46:46.825
Destroy his plans. It was easy. He would normally suffocate, except the cannibal would continue to restore for a living to stay. He doesn't need to breathe. In other words, he's dying all the time. That's right, he's 
dying all the time. He's in bed, isn't he? Actually, I've taken all these speculations purely in terms of a nuclear plant. The normal speculation is, in fact, neutron... See, talking with neutron planets, there's

02:47:13.197 --> 02:47:20.195
nothing to know about them. They don't explode. But there is one bloody astronomical objective. We haven't seen, we think it's there, or was there, that did explode. None of the big bang. If Krypton were the big 
bangers, he might explain how all his superpowers very quickly. It would also imply, in effect, that as mass goes, he's got the mass of a galaxy stored away inside him, which is in the form of energy. It's no wonder he's

02:47:45.053 --> 02:47:47.057
so bloody indestructible. You can't get enough energy up to a nuclear rungly fixin'. Oh yeah, interesting effect from nuclear physics. Boundaries. You have a potential barrier, or actually a potential well, which 
has got so much potential. If anything, it's very important. I mean, you know, it's like saying, you've got this incredibly deep well, and you walk up to the well, and you've topped something into it, and it just fall

02:47:59.453 --> 02:48:06.381
away, right? You know, it's like on top of a cliff. So it's like, you know, when it goes out, it's simple. Except, in nuclear conditions, you get potential wells, and in fact, they're so deep, they, in fact, you can't 
throw things into them, because they look black from them. So in fact, if he's got some of the energy stored into it, he'll reflect matter to our world there. This is one of the reasons we actually modulate it.

02:48:26.989 --> 02:48:33.515
Otherwise, if he takes a step, he pushes the weight of the floor underneath it, things like that, and he can just keep going to go structure here. He has to be modulated. Ah, yes, he's modulated, of course. This means 
that he's maxed. Because he's modulated, he's making the changes of the structure he's causing, not the structure he wants, he can quite easily make himself sport, make with human beings. What do we do?

02:48:53.864 --> 02:48:54.245
Why? Why? I don't

02:48:55.950 --> 02:49:01.386
know. When

02:49:01.754 --> 02:49:08.761
he flies past the planet, he's got a red sun. He usually drops to the planet. He doesn't keep flying, like he said. Right, sir. How can I have a DC-colored stuff like that? What probability would you say would exist on a 
planet like this? I could technically, 353,000. I don't have on a Earth planet this is the planet. Right. So if I know those people who have been at the Sydney candle in a bottle, we'll have a lot of trouble. Not just that,

02:49:34.766 --> 02:49:40.052
but there's some from a visitor who's been through the time there. Ah, why couldn't you? You might be. Do you see that, though? That's why. Not as Jim Harris, let's be fair. You're a complete seeker. You've got giants, 
haven't you? Actually,

02:49:54.708 --> 02:50:05.984
we've turned the slides. They're some interesting stuff. Quick backwards, actually. I'm going forward. Okay, superman typically writing a change of kryptonite. I'll go through them until he gets real easy. There 
should be three more after that, actually.

02:50:29.451 --> 02:50:31.476
Well, this won't show Superman doing that. Actually, this is incredible. A man who can do everything. Why doesn't he take over the world? I mean, there's nothing there. That's probably why. Because

02:50:38.331 --> 02:50:49.991
he's a kryptonian, he's a kryptonian to a bloke. Yeah, actually psychologically, the man would be incredibly interesting. I mean, everyone says, you know, right, you can do everything, but you know, where's the 
challenge? He's willing to help creatures which are, in fact, pathetically weak by his standards and incredibly moronic.

02:51:14.684 --> 02:51:18.512
Psychologies, but continue to this life. Now we get to the funny one I do. This is a funny one I took in three parts. That's the first one. It actually is the second one. That's the one with the bloody slides. Show us the 
next one. That is the first slide. Show us the second one. That's the second one. That's the third one.

02:51:39.552 --> 02:51:44.459
The last one, I think I could say off, we're going to go into the last round. Well, through them. They're quite fascinating stuff. The focus is off. Oh, yes, folks. I just had a time count. For those of you who attend the 
bank at 8 o'clock, you're going to attend it at least half an hour later.

02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:11.203
We're sort of empirical type science, you know, sort of stuff you can work out if you look up the physics and the chemistry and the biology and you want to bat your brains out about it. But this kind of stuff, in fact, is 
what Let's try the Swab, though. They're all rather Swab, actually. This is what you can do if you just use your imagination. What Brian always calls a runcible science vector, as opposed to the empirical, which is

02:52:22.194 --> 02:52:31.691
more hard-line, rationalistic, and logical. Which, of course, has got a lot of blur due, but it's damn hard work. Continue. This stuff, of course, requires a lot more imagination. Now, let's go back and think, you 
know. Bishop Godwin's thing, very pretty, it's a weird idea. Quite squadrons of swans. Pegasus in a, well, a boxy version. But to continue.

02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:54.980
Pretty about that one. It's quite a nice start, but... And includes... I, um, oh well, let's go along. You're right. That is a flying elephant, of course. Flying elephant. Continue. Yes, it is, actually. That one is a 
flying elephant. I'm ready to fly an elephant. About to swoop, actually. Continue. That one is upside down, but it probably doesn't matter with that one. Uh, continue.

02:53:37.964 --> 02:53:38.905
That one is very pretty. Continue.

02:53:46.394 --> 02:53:56.867
Haha, yes, an old friend

02:53:46.394 --> 02:53:56.867
of mine.

02:53:58.366 --> 02:54:00.429
Another battle scene. A kind of armored turidactyl, a few armored armadillos, nasty growlings in a grovy nest, and armored armadillos.

02:54:15.614 --> 02:54:21.403
Much more like things rearing out of the ground like fish resting on top of one of them, obviously. Yeah. And these are mushroom type things floating in space, which is absolutely fantastic. That slide which enter is 
really stuffed up. It's pretty about that because they are very nice slides. Is that the last one? Well, there's that other little group. Oh, that little group. Yes, there's one. Yes, go ahead. Very well. It's

02:54:40.847 --> 02:54:47.475
actually a map of the galaxy out of diameter of about 10,000 light-years. It lists the major astronomical objects within that sphere. Send it on our sun. Continue. He leaves you out of focus. Ah, damn. That is a Dr. Hoot 
as William Huttville. William Hart will stop the video.

02:55:04.573 --> 02:55:07.656
That's John Pertwee at a TARDIS console, modern version. Hi, darling. What's up? Hi, mate. Next one, please. Hi, I'm Irving. Come on, darling. Oh, you don't have money. Yeah. Oh, I'd like to again. That's Patrick

02:55:29.542 --> 02:55:39.401
Trout from Doctor Who. This is a follow-up on Doctor Who. And that's John Fertwee being surprised by something. I doubt that Alex's saying he's surprised, but that's it for us.

02:55:56.778 --> 02:56:02.466
The following knowledge meets after this. This presentation would have been impossible. The Adventure Subcommittee, Dr. J. R. Patterson, University of Adelaide Physics Department, the State Library of South 
Australia, Rod Hannah, Paul Stokes, Joy Window, and Tinaka Kempen.

02:56:34.730 --> 02:56:49.896

Yes, 45 cents, do I hear anything more? Never. Good, sold to the man over there for 45.

02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:10.880

02:58:37.953 --> 02:58:38.394

two large poor man owned logs August 1964 November 1963.

03:02:35.703 --> 03:02:36.604

03:02:55.340 --> 03:02:55.640
$1.00. August 1964. $1.00. It's $1.00. Not in really good nick. There's an increase going on a dollar. Go under the dollar. To give it a second.
