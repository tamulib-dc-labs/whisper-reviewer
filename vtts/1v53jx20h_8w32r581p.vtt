00:37.291 --> 00:39.054
[Tom Turbeville]: Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley. I'm Tom Turbeville. Some call it the Forgotten War, but Norman Beale of 
rural Bradstess County has not forgotten a thing about his 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, assault on the Korean coast in

00:41.478 --> 00:51.936
[Tom Turbeville]: 1950. Nor has he forgotten the horror and the cold of that winter, scaling the cliffs at the beaches at Incheon. The card 
game that he lost that kept him in Korea to fight even longer. The Korean War cost 54,000 American lives and another 8,000

01:03.538 --> 01:08.324
[Tom Turbeville]: were missing. Norman Beale counts himself very lucky to have survived to tell his story of service. Please welcome 
Norman Beale of Edge to Veterans of the Valley. Mr. Beale, it's an honor to have you on Veterans of the Valley and thank you

01:17.194 --> 01:21.239
[Tom Turbeville]: first for your service. You were a local kid all the way. You grew up in Bryan. You graduated from Allen Academy in 1948. 
and want to move right along because you joined the Marine Corps soon after you graduated from high school in 1948. Sort

01:35.311 --> 01:42.200
[Tom Turbeville]: of take us from there and your service in the Marine Corps and sort of how that got you overseas to Korea. 

01:43.862 --> 01:56.978
[Norman Beale]: Well, I was overseas in other places also for a couple of years and came back to the States and a few months later we had to turn around and go back. 
But we didn't, and the Marine Corps at that time in 1948 only had about 75,000

01:58.207 --> 02:09.561
[Norman Beale]: Marines.

02:10.202 --> 02:17.190
[Norman Beale]: So they had to scrape all over the world to get more Marines to develop a brigade. General MacArthur was calling for 
Marines early and all we could gather up was one brigade and each battalion was missing one company. And the

02:35.300 --> 02:41.189
[Norman Beale]: companies that we did have only had two platoons. So that was...

02:41.189 --> 02:53.491
[Tom Turbeville]: This was a time that the military had 
really changed because it was after World War II and the military was kind of scaling down at that time. 

02:53.491 --> 02:53.491
[Norman Beale]: Very much so. 

02:53.491 --> 02:59.567
[Tom Turbeville]: You talked about how the military had changed during this time between World War II and before the Korean War broke out. 

02:59.567 --> 03:06.041
[Norman Beale]: Yeah, after World War II, all future wars were going to be push-button. And so the Air Force decided they didn't

03:06.041 --> 03:20.096
[Norman Beale]: need too many Army personnel, didn't even need the Marines, but the Navy, they wanted to keep the Navy. 

03:20.096 --> 03:25.458
[Tom Turbeville]: Right, right, right. You had spent a long time... on a boat. I know you'd gone out to the Marianas Islands in the West Pacific for your

03:25.458 --> 03:37.270
[Tom Turbeville]: training and you came home, said you'd never get on a boat again, but that was wrong because Korean War broke out and you 
were headed to Korea. 

3:37.270 --> 03:40.696
[Norman Beale]: I didn't want to get in on any more stinking ships. 

03:42.696 --> 03:51.525
[Tom Turbeville]: You talk highly about the training that you got because you said that a lot of the NCOs and the officers were World War II veterans who were 
certainly a war experience themselves. So you did get some good training from these folks. 

03:51.525 --> 04:00.501
[Norman Beale]: Yes, and just the Marine Corps trains all the time. 

04:00.501 --> 04:14.339
[Norman Beale]: I finally got back to the States and I got out of the Fleet Marine Force and was put in a company that didn't go in the field. So 
our new colonel decided we were getting soft And after I was there about three weeks, we were put in the field again.

04:24.180 --> 04:24.421
[Norman Beale]: And I learned how to dig foxholes again. 

04:24.421 --> 04:31.930
[Tom Turbeville]: And you would need that later on, obviously. 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines. 
This is one of the oldest outfits dating back to World War I. As a matter of fact, I looked up, it was the German soldiers

04:31.930 --> 04:44.344
[Tom Turbeville]: that actually gave them the nickname the Devil Dogs because they were so tough fighting in World War I in 1918. 

04:44.344 --> 04:51.641 
[Norman Beale]: Bellow Wood. That's right. That's right. 

04:51.641 --> 04:57.135
[Tom Turbeville]: So this was a part of the outfit that you were in. You left San Diego August of 1950 and thought you were going to stop over in Japan, 
but you went straight to the coast of Korea to Busan. Talk about that. 

04:57.135 --> 05:14.767
[Norman Beale]: There was not much of South Korea left. That's why we didn't stop. And when we got to Busan, Korea, our general was down on

05:14.767 --> 05:22.080
[Norman Beale]: the dock, and he wanted to know if Colonel Murray had gotten his message. And Murray called down and said, no, sir. And he 
said, well, you get off the ship now, and let's move on to the front. And that was his message that we didn't get. But

05:39.691 --> 05:44.377
[Norman Beale]: fortunately, we spent that whole night unloading the ship. And early the next morning, we moved forward. 

05:44.377 --> 05:56.671
[Tom Turbeville]: So you didn't stick around long. You were headed to the front. Talk about that. Talk about your first venture into combat,

05:56.671 --> 06:01.197
[Tom Turbeville]: heading towards North Korea. What you recall about that? Because you're still a young kid. I mean, you're a young kid 
from the country. And it was quite a... Quite a change in your life, obviously. 

06:01.197 --> 06:10.969
[Norman Beale]: We were down in South Korea, and like I say,

06:10.969 --> 06:19.502
[Norman Beale]: we were pushed into combat right away on August the 7th. We attacked, and that was the same date that the offensive action 
in World War II, August the 7th at Guadalcanal, the 1st Marine Division, which the 5th Marines was part of. And we,

06:37.043 --> 06:46.817
[Norman Beale]: after a few days, we had pushed the North Koreans back 30 miles, 30-plus miles. And the very next day or two, we were 
called back. Down south, they could not protect our sides. And we then were put in what we call the fire brigade. We'd move

07:03.496 --> 07:09.164
[Norman Beale]: from one spot to another, trying to hold the North Koreans back. And we had two major battles on the Nakdong River. The 
first Nakdong, we pushed them back over the river, and we all went down and rested two days or three days. And we were

07:24.185 --> 07:34.714
[Norman Beale]: called back up because we had lost, or the military had lost, the Nakdong front again. It was called the Nakdong Bulge, 
the 6th North Korean People's Army. Very sophisticated. They had come from Seoul, the capital, all the way down to this

07:44.903 --> 08:00.162
[Norman Beale]: little area down in Busan we call it the Busan Perimeter and they had not hit anything but they found a new breed of cat down 
there right and so you go ahead then we were pulled off the night tone and all of a sudden we went down to Seoul

08:00.142 --> 08:21.880
[Norman Beale]: Busan right and we got on board ship and we started we thought maybe we'd get to go back to Japan for our duty 

08:21.880 --> 08:23.880
[Tom Turbeville]: Because you'd done such a good job. 

08:23.880 --> 08:25.880
[Norman Beale]: Because we'd done such a good job. 

08:25.880 --> 08:26.000
[Tom Turbeville]: But? 

08:26.000 --> 08:26.956
[Norman Beale]: I looked out one morning and there were ships in every

08:26.956 --> 08:29.844
[Norman Beale]: direction. And then they come on the intercom and they told us that we had been selected. to hit the North Koreans right in 
the throat. We were going to make an Incheon landing at Seoul. Seoul was about 30-something miles from Incheon.

08:51.617 --> 08:59.484
[Norman Beale]: But when we got to Incheon, all the Navy were bombarding Incheon, poor people. And our planes were coming over and 
strafing and bombing. Didn't see how anybody could live. But anyway, one of our battalions had to take a small island

09:09.879 --> 09:19.361
[Norman Beale]: right out from Incheon. It had a causeway going into Incheon.

09:19.361 --> 09:24.361
[Tom Turbeville]: This was Wamido Island, is that right? Is that what you told me? I believe that's what you told me the other day. 

09:24.361 --> 09:24.361
[Norman Beale]: Amigo. 

09:24.361 --> 09:36.227
[Tom Turbeville]: Oh, Amigo, there we go. I was close. And it had a causeway, actually, from the island to the mainland. 

09:36.227 --> 09:42.227
[Norman Beale]: Yes, to the mainland. And that 3rd Battalion had to set up on that causeway to keep from attacking on the causeway. 

09:42.227 --> 09:48.565
[Tom Turbeville]: Right, but the island was armed with North Koreans. 

09:48.565 --> 09:49.426
[Norman Beale]: Yes, oh yes. Right. And we pretty well wiped them, our third battalion pretty well wiped them all out. Right.

09:49.426 --> 09:53.429
[Tom Turbeville]: Now, while you 
were witnessing this, were you still on the boat or had you... 

09:53.429 --> 09:55.429
[Norman Beale]: I was still on the boat. 

09:53.429 --> 10:03.429
[Tom Turbeville]: You were still on the ship. 

10:03.429 --> 10:05.230
[Norman Beale]: Yes. We had two battalions still on. We had got our third battalion finally. And we were on board. Now, the reason we were 
on board in Korea, they had one of the highest

10:11.156 --> 10:19.583
[Norman Beale]: water... up 30, the tide, 30 feet, and then it would drop. And after it dropped, there was just a huge mudflat out there, 
and our ships were in the mud, still shooting. So we had ladders that the Navy had fixed for us, and we crawled up a seawall.

10:47.350 --> 10:53.957
[Norman Beale]: And when we got off the seawall, my old gunnery sergeant was walking up and down. And as you know, a gunnery sergeant in the 
Marine Corps uses words that I wouldn't repeat right now. 

10:53.957 --> 11:07.473
[Tom Turbeville]: That's why he's a gunnery sergeant. That's right. Get off the

11:07.473 --> 11:18.334
[Norman Beale]: That's right. Get off the beach. Get off the beach. And we captured our inch on pretty quick. Excuse me. I got mixed up. Right. And as soon as we did, 
then we started for soul. 

11:18.334 --> 11:21.334
[Tom Turbeville]: Now, I want our viewers to be able to picture this. You're on foot. 

11:21.334 --> 11:22.334
[Norman Beale]: Yes. 

11:22.334 --> 11:32.348
[Tom Turbeville]: Right? What kind of weaponry did you personally have? 

11:32.348 --> 11:42.348
[Norman Beale]: I started out with a machine gun, and then later on I got the arc carbine and I got rid of 
it as soon as I could and got an M1 rifle. And it was a very good rifle. 

Oh, yeah. I know. So you're marching and

11:52.060 --> 11:54.243
[Tom Turbeville]: you're battling? 

Well, we're battling. 

because this is what the war was all about. 

We captured Kempo Airfield, which 
wasn't any tarmac there other than a few knockdown yaks. And we made another landing after we captured the air base. And

12:17.608 --> 12:24.778
[Norman Beale]: we crossed the Hahn River in LCVP's landing craft. We made it across and then we headed to Seoul. My battalion did not go 
down, our regiment did not go down into the city of Seoul. That was the first regiment with Chesty Puller and his group.

12:43.253 --> 12:43.653
[Tom Turbeville]: Right. Talk about Mr. Puller. He was the most decorated soldier of the Korean War, right? He was the most decorated 
Marine. Marine, excuse me, yes. Of the Korean War, of all wars that he was in. He was fought in the Banana Wars and all the

12:54.085 --> 12:58.590
[Norman Beale]: way up. That was a good outfit. Right, right. He was one who said, we've got the enemy in front of us. We've got him in back of 
us. And we've got him on each side. We've got him right where we want him. He can't get away now. And he was about right. I

13:15.602 --> 13:25.114
[Tom Turbeville]: know that you're reluctant to talk specifically about, as you refer to it, the blood and guts of war. And I understand 
that. But what were your thoughts about what you were seeing? Were you frightened? Did your training kick in? when it

13:37.068 --> 13:38.271
[Tom Turbeville]: needed to? What were your thoughts about life and death at that time that you recall? Well, you know, if you're in combat, 
you're afraid until you go into the attack. or until the enemy goes into an attack. So then you get fairly calm.

13:59.463 --> 14:04.954
[Norman Beale]: We had some horrible battles down in the perimeter, Busan perimeter. But when we got on board ship, we went up to Inchon, 
captured the capital of Seoul. went back down got on board ship surely it's our and our duty but we went all the way around

14:13.670 --> 14:38.732
[Norman Beale]: the peninsula of korea to the east side of korea north korea right to a place called wansan it was more of an 
administrative uh

14:13.670 --> 14:38.732
[Norman Beale]: movement into the city of wansan right And then a day or two later, we got on board a train, flat cars. It's starting to get 
cold. Yes, sir. And we headed north. And one of the things that really had us worried was we went through a long, long

14:51.131 --> 14:56.164
[Norman Beale]: tunnel. And fortunately, the North Koreans were not thinking about that tunnel. Went on up to Hagaroo, North Korea, and 
then we headed north. headed for the Chosin Reservoir area. And just before we got to the mountains, we had mountains on

15:18.651 --> 15:23.381
[Norman Beale]: top of mountains. We got on board a small, very small cow track going up into North Korea, or up into the reservoir area. 
When we got up there, I think I have heard, I don't know of anybody that had a thermometer, but I heard that when we got to the

15:39.910 --> 15:52.888
[Norman Beale]: top, it was over 13 degrees below zero. And that was a physiological shock. And thank goodness no one attacked that 
night. Stayed there a few days and then the 7th Regiment and the 5th Regiment moved up to Hageroo, North Korea, which was

15:59.898 --> 16:14.447
[Norman Beale]: right at the bottom of the big reservoir. Our regiment went up the right side, or the east side, and a day or two, we had 
Thanksgiving.

16:27.834 --> 16:33.364
[Norman Beale]: And it kind of warmed up, incidentally, but we were only there just Three or four days. Right. And we started down because 
two regiments, our partial regiments of the 7th Army Division, came up to the right side and took our place. Right. And

16:51.087 --> 16:53.329
[Norman Beale]: they were pretty well slaughtered later. I think 800 got out. Right. Let's pause right there and let's look at some 
photographs. of some of the things we're talking about because you have mentioned how cold it became. And we've got some

17:08.101 --> 17:13.008
[Tom Turbeville]: photographs that depict 30 and 40 blue. Right. Let's look at some pictures. First off, this is you and your older 
brothers. You're the baby of the family. You're on the left. That's correct. And these are your brothers. Right. Who are

17:23.062 --> 17:26.166
[Tom Turbeville]: they from, say, from right to left as we're looking at it? Right to left, Ralph Beale. Yes, sir. My brother Ralph. He was 
next to me. Oh, next to you. Okay. And the oldest one was Jacob Beale in the middle there. And Oren Beale. So Oren is on the

17:40.252 --> 17:42.977
[Tom Turbeville]: right as we're looking at the picture here. Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. I started over here. That's fine. I understand. 
Okay. I think the next picture we have is you as a young Marine. There you are. Yeah. Was that when you just joined up? When I

17:56.235 --> 17:57.837
[Norman Beale]: just got out of boot camp. Just got out of boot camp. You got in the dress blues. Good looking. I found this photograph 
depicting the landing at Incheon and the type of ladders. This probably looks somewhat familiar to you. Very, very much

18:11.151 --> 18:12.433
[Norman Beale]: so. The guy right up at the top was a lieutenant and he was killed five or six yards later because when he was getting his men 
off the boat and somebody threw a grenade and this guy, he did not fight down in the south. This was his first combat. And he

18:35.667 --> 18:39.711
[Norman Beale]: covered that grenade, saving the men on each side. He got the Medal of Honor. I wish I could remember his name, but I can't. 
Okay, let's move on. This is a photograph that certainly depicts the cold, the snow, the cold, just trying to get some

18:48.580 --> 18:56.691
[Tom Turbeville]: sleep, trying to get some rest, right? Actually, we were on the road. We were surrounded. We were cut off up at a place 
called Yudamni, and Hangeroo was cut off on both sides by the North Koreans, or by the Chinese, excuse me. There's

19:12.728 --> 19:27.562
[Norman Beale]: 120,000 Chinese that came in with strict orders to do away with the Marines because they were killers, murderers, 
rapists, thieves. Right. So they tried. We were able to severely knock out seven infantry divisions of the Chinese. And

19:43.448 --> 19:48.416
[Norman Beale]: they had a few more that got out. Right. Some more photographs. Talk about this photograph. You're in the middle. Yeah, I 
had that air crew 30 machine gun right at first. Right. And my two buddies there with me. The one on the right was Texan.

20:05.155 --> 20:05.476
[Norman Beale]: Yes, sir. And he's dead today. And you're the one in the middle without the helmet. Right. Right. Right. This wasn't 
during the cold part, obviously. No. Very, very humid. Right. And yet up to around 113. Right. And we didn't have enough

20:23.880 --> 20:25.524
[Norman Beale]: water. Right. Okay. This is another one of David Douglas Duncan's photographs, and I believe these are not Marines 
here. There's some Marines in the ditch there. Yes, sir. But he didn't like that photograph, but yet it was used on a

20:40.443 --> 20:45.550
[Norman Beale]: stamp. Right. That's that picture. Incredible photograph. There you are, as you were fixing to be able to come home. 
Right. You've grown yourself a little pretty good looking stash there. Right. I don't know how I got away with it. The

21:04.606 --> 21:06.830
[Norman Beale]: Marine Corps doesn't put up with that. But you told the story about that if you wanted to go R&R to Japan, You had to get that 
shaved off, and you were the first to get yours shaved off. Is that right? It came off immediately. Yeah, I bet it did. I was

21:17.745 --> 21:24.997
[Norman Beale]: standing right next to one of my men on board ship, and I was making comments. He turned around and looked at me, and he 
said, Bill, is that you? Without the beard? Let's move on to the next. This is a... Those are prisoners. Yeah, this is a

21:38.042 --> 21:41.488
[Tom Turbeville]: newspaper that comes out. This was spring of 84 called The Chosen Few. It's a sort of a publication that is about your 
unit. You know, excuse me, we hear about torture today. Yes, sir. We got the word that you do not mistreat any enemy

21:58.475 --> 22:03.582
[Norman Beale]: soldier. We want them to come out with their hands up. Yes, sir. Not too many of them did, but some of them did. Right. Let's 
move on to... Now tell me, this is you on the right. Tell me about the person on the left. And this is a person that you

22:17.084 --> 22:21.768
[Tom Turbeville]: actually took out of a foxhole, right? Right. Is this Mr. Dixon? Yes, sir. And he was my buddy after we met there. I didn't 
know who he was. Right. He had both legs blown off. And he came up to me and put his arm around me and hugged my neck. This was

22:39.183 --> 22:40.504
[Tom Turbeville]: at a reunion, right? Right. Uh-huh. And I don't know where they even knew what outfit he was in because we had 
replacements coming in all the time. And you had drug him out of a foxhole and this is the first time that you all have seen

22:52.430 --> 22:58.642
[Tom Turbeville]: each other since then in 1950. Right. Since 1950. Right.

23:04.912 --> 23:12.809
[Norman Beale]: He was in that foxhole and there were others wounded and some killed in a martyr attack. That day, we had gone through a 
small, small village And I got the honor to be sent back to that village to kick in doors to make sure everybody was out. And

23:26.168 --> 23:35.538
[Norman Beale]: I think about these guys over in Afghanistan and Iraq that have to kick in those doors and the chills run up and down my 
back. I want to move along because we're running short on time. You had talked about fighting the Chinese because the

23:45.293 --> 23:53.160
[Tom Turbeville]: North Koreans were pretty much punched out about this time and fighting the Chinese. And one thing that you credit 
really for saving your life during one battle is the World War II Corsairs and how they provided cover for you in one of the

23:53.630 --> 24:04.448
[Tom Turbeville]: battles in North Korea. The Marine Corps has an air ground team. And on the ground, we had flyers that were forward 
observers because they knew how to talk to the men up in these Corsairs. These were old World War II. In fact, everything

24:21.334 --> 24:32.344
[Norman Beale]: we had was World War II equipment, except later on we had one of these bubbled helicopters that you see in MASH. Right, 
right. Exactly. They'd put Marines wounded on both sides and take them back as fast as they could and then come back.

24:41.153 --> 24:41.413
[Tom Turbeville]: Right. You talked about going back, getting on ships, and how those ships were stuffed with some but you estimate about 
100,000 North Koreans that you took. Oh, yes. Yeah, that went to South Korea with you. And the first thing you did when you

24:58.278 --> 25:02.423
[Tom Turbeville]: got back on the ship was find a lifeboat to sleep. You were hungry, but sleep was more important. Is that right? I crawled 
under a lifeboat. I didn't even go around in that stinking ship. You found out about this time that you were a corporal,

25:10.192 --> 25:15.539
[Tom Turbeville]: there was another corporal, and only one corporal could go back home. And it was you, the other corporal was a young man, 
was a fellow from Houston. Yes. And they said, decide between yourselves which one goes home and which one stays. And how

25:24.550 --> 25:25.551
[Tom Turbeville]: did you do that? We drew cards. Somebody had some cards. I don't know where they came from. Right. But I drew a six, and 
McMahon drew a six. Right. And so we had to draw again. I drew a ten, and he drew a jack, and he got to go. And you got to stay,

25:47.819 --> 25:50.863
[Norman Beale]: and you thought... I thought that was the end to me. I would not get out of there. Right. But I did about a month later. I got 
out. You got out about a month later? Yeah. And so in all, your service in Korea was about eight months, is that right?

26:04.712 --> 26:05.734
[Norman Beale]: Eight months, that's right. The brigade people, they were pulled out first because they'd been in constant battle. 
Right. The Korean War was an intense war, as you can see from the number of people killed. Yeah, you had talked, as a matter

26:20.155 --> 26:27.744
[Tom Turbeville]: of fact, you brought some numbers there from the chosen reservoir, the number of killed just from that. Right. There was 
approximately 15,000 of us up in the reservoir area, plus some army that went on the east side of the reservoir. The 7th
