00:01.420 --> 00:07.620
Science fiction writer Stanley Schmidt is the new editor of Analog, succeeding another

00:07.620 --> 00:08.660
writer, Ben Boba.

00:09.780 --> 00:15.340
Schmidt's own stories have appeared frequently in Analog, and some are collected in Lifeboat

00:15.340 --> 00:17.720
Earth, published in 1978.

00:18.980 --> 00:25.180
One of his earlier novels is also available, Newton and the Quasi-Apple, which came out

00:25.180 --> 00:27.340
in 1977 in paperback.

00:28.880 --> 00:34.520
Stanley Schmidt has been professor of physics at Heidelberg College in Ohio.

00:35.020 --> 00:39.700
As now devoting, I understand the majority of his time to editing.

00:40.440 --> 00:45.160
I'm sure there's some pluses and minuses to this whole business of being an editor,

00:45.660 --> 00:50.400
Stan, the main minus being you can't devote as much time to your own work.

00:50.940 --> 00:51.480
Isn't that true?

00:51.480 --> 00:58.740
Well, I'm not at all sure that it is in my case because I have never been a full-time

00:58.740 --> 01:03.400
writer, except unless you count the year that I was on a sabbatical when I was teaching.

01:03.680 --> 01:07.400
But most of the time I was either a full-time student or a full-time professor.

01:09.740 --> 01:14.320
And Ben Boba tells me that he thinks that that probably ate up at least as much time

01:14.320 --> 01:15.240
as the editing does.

01:15.240 --> 01:20.740
And I think the editing job is possibly more directly stimulating to the writing.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.480
So his expectation is that I ought to be able to do at least as much writing as I have been.

01:25.880 --> 01:29.620
And so far I venture to hope that that's true.

01:30.280 --> 01:35.660
We have seen no lack of output on his part, so I assume that there's some proof to that.

01:36.140 --> 01:36.420
Yeah.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.860
He may have worked too hard.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.300
He said that he did more writing while he was editor than he ever did before that.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.280
Are you into it now?

01:48.540 --> 01:50.300
You've started already as editor?

01:50.480 --> 01:50.640
Yeah.

01:50.860 --> 01:56.200
I started at the beginning of September, which is interesting because I didn't move into

01:56.200 --> 01:58.660
the New York area until the middle of October.

01:59.100 --> 02:03.340
So for the first month and a half I was probably the only person working in New York City who

02:03.340 --> 02:05.040
was commuting from Tiffin, Ohio.

02:06.240 --> 02:10.380
Do you miss the college campus atmosphere in any way?

02:11.800 --> 02:18.580
There were things about it that I liked, but I'd say there are enough different things

02:18.580 --> 02:21.880
that I like about where I am now that I don't have any regrets.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.420
I'll look for chances to visit occasionally.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.120
Do you expect that eventually you may go back to teaching again?

02:30.340 --> 02:33.240
I have no expectations that far in the future.

02:35.420 --> 02:41.920
Analog is identified as a magazine of science fact as well as science fiction.

02:42.280 --> 02:46.040
Now do you intend to continue this policy?

02:46.780 --> 02:47.360
Yes.

02:49.140 --> 02:54.260
At least in the same way that it is now, and possibly with a slight variation.

02:55.960 --> 03:01.800
The policy so far has been that it's a fact magazine in the sense that it normally has

03:01.800 --> 03:04.200
one factual article per month.

03:05.360 --> 03:10.260
Now a suggestion which I've received from several people in which I'm considering is

03:10.920 --> 03:24.240
adding a sort of science fact newsletter type of column that's shorter, but has one or

03:24.460 --> 03:29.220
This would be a very short thing, but it would be still a little bit of added page space

03:29.220 --> 03:34.080
devoted to fact, which subtracts from what's available for fiction, so I haven't decided

03:34.080 --> 03:35.460
yet whether I want to do it or not.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.480
I can see both advantages and disadvantages in that.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.520
Fortunately, I don't have to decide right away.

03:41.020 --> 03:46.100
Are these factual articles highly technical or are they actually written for the benefit

03:46.100 --> 03:46.760
of the layman?

03:47.180 --> 03:49.140
They're a science fiction fan, if you will.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.860
I would say it's somewhere in between.

03:54.940 --> 03:57.120
For the science fiction fans, yes.

03:58.940 --> 04:02.520
Possibly to some extent a subset of science fiction fans.

04:02.640 --> 04:10.020
I would hesitate to say either technical or for just any layman, because in general the

04:10.020 --> 04:14.400
analog audience tends to be very intelligent and very highly educated.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.120
Most of them have strong technical backgrounds, but they don't all have the same kind of

04:19.120 --> 04:20.160
technical background.

04:21.400 --> 04:27.440
We try to see that the articles are written in such a way as to take advantage of a good

04:27.440 --> 04:31.460
general background, but without anything very specialized or highly technical.

04:32.040 --> 04:37.180
Are the articles commissioned from certain scientists?

04:37.700 --> 04:39.620
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

04:39.840 --> 04:43.960
We get freelance submissions and sometimes we know somebody would like to do one.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.380
Ask them to.

04:48.540 --> 04:55.480
As an editor, what sorts of things do you look for in a science fiction story?

04:55.800 --> 04:58.200
In other words, how do you begin by judging it?

05:00.140 --> 05:02.500
Well, first of all, I look for good fiction.

05:04.860 --> 05:09.660
And by this, I mean it has to keep my interest on it.

05:10.100 --> 05:15.360
We get so many manuscripts in a week that one of the first things I do is I look for

05:15.360 --> 05:19.640
things that I had to overcome when I started this job was a tendency that I'd carefully

05:19.640 --> 05:21.400
cultivated when I was teaching college.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.300
I did a science fiction course there in which students submitted stories.

05:25.860 --> 05:30.480
And there, every student who submitted something was a paying customer, and I felt obligated

05:30.480 --> 05:33.780
to give every story very careful attention and constructive criticism.

05:34.700 --> 05:39.460
Now with 100 manuscripts a week coming in, I simply can't do that, and so I've had to

05:39.460 --> 05:44.640
resist the temptation to think of careful comments on everything and learn to read

05:44.640 --> 05:51.480
very fast through some things which you can tell at a glance simply aren't well written.

05:53.340 --> 05:58.820
And so it bothered me at first to be flipping through the pages so fast.

05:59.980 --> 06:05.180
But then I realized that the stories which are going to impress readers have to have

06:05.180 --> 06:08.460
something about them which is special enough to keep the reader's mind on the page.

06:09.240 --> 06:13.320
And if the story doesn't keep my mind on the page enough to slow me down and make me pay

06:13.320 --> 06:15.620
more careful attention to it, I probably don't want it.

06:16.400 --> 06:22.380
So the first thing it has to do is be written in such a way that it keeps my interest.

06:24.100 --> 06:28.280
No different, really, from judging any short story, whatever field.

06:29.060 --> 06:33.600
And it has a lot of other things also in common with other short stories.

06:33.600 --> 06:41.860
In a case it has to have good characters and plots that make sense in their own framework.

06:43.300 --> 06:48.800
In fact, science fiction has all the same requirements as any other fiction, plus a few specialized ones,

06:49.860 --> 06:55.680
which are in addition, and the specialized ones are a little bit hard to put into words.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.100
But basically the thing I'm looking here is where does the science fit into it?

06:59.100 --> 07:04.060
There's always some sort of speculative science element in the story.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.980
And this doesn't mean the story is about science.

07:09.300 --> 07:13.120
Usually these days it's more about the impact of the science on people.

07:13.720 --> 07:19.060
But for it to be really science fiction, the kind that I'm looking for, the science has to be so integral to the plot

07:19.060 --> 07:27.880
that if you tried to took the science element out, the whole story would collapse and it couldn't be told.

07:27.880 --> 07:36.020
If you think of some types of things which are often considered science fiction, for instance,

07:36.620 --> 07:38.120
am I allowed to mention a movie by name?

07:38.280 --> 07:38.620
Certainly.

07:39.140 --> 07:44.420
Star Wars is a good Western with great special effects.

07:45.640 --> 07:49.840
I've really called a good comic book a story, but not necessarily a Western.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.360
I would hesitate to call it science fiction.

07:52.360 --> 07:58.160
And to do them credit, I believe I read somewhere that the people who made it said that they never intended it to be science fiction.

07:58.860 --> 08:08.580
But my predecessor was often quite upset about the fact that he thought the public was getting the impression that this was what science fiction is all about.

08:09.160 --> 08:16.020
And it's not because you can take the spaceships and replace them with horses and the lasers and replace them with six guns.

08:16.820 --> 08:19.760
And the story still works essentially the same way.

08:22.360 --> 08:29.680
I'm looking for things in which the scientific elements place such a role that you can't do that if you take the scientific element out.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.820
Nothing is left of the story.

08:32.260 --> 08:44.460
Now some stories have been criticized because they contain what might be termed unscientific propositions or totally inane hypotheses.

08:45.440 --> 08:50.300
Have you ever run across this sort of thing and you have a physics background?

08:51.520 --> 08:57.180
Do you feel that you should judge on the scientific plausibility of any story?

08:58.140 --> 08:59.680
That's certainly a part of it.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.360
If I find something which is demonstrably implausible, I won't take it.

09:06.180 --> 09:12.940
However, the criterion I use for there is a little bit different as a science fiction writer or editor than it is as a physicist.

09:15.500 --> 09:22.740
I would not require that any element which is used in science fiction story be demonstrably possible.

09:23.440 --> 09:28.720
What I do try to require is that it's not provably impossible with present knowledge.

09:28.840 --> 09:29.360
That's a good point.

09:29.420 --> 09:34.760
It's a very strong distinction which is sometimes very hard to get across to people.

09:36.440 --> 09:42.320
For example, that something which is controversial even among people involved in science fiction is faster than light travel.

09:44.460 --> 09:45.960
Is it possible or isn't it?

09:46.680 --> 09:55.300
It's often alleged that the theory of relativity proves that nothing can ever go faster than light.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.140
That particular argument that happens, I don't buy.

10:00.660 --> 10:04.080
I don't find it convincing either as a science fiction writer or a physicist.

10:06.360 --> 10:14.520
But for this reason, I'm perfectly willing to accept that logically it worked out faster than light travel system as part of the story.

10:14.900 --> 10:19.500
This does not mean that I'd necessarily believe that I know that faster than light travel is possible.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.680
I just don't believe I've ever met anybody yet who knows that it isn't.

10:23.040 --> 10:28.420
It seems like most science fiction writers today simply assume that it's possible and then go on from there.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.920
How could you get to some of these other worlds without it, you see?

10:31.920 --> 10:33.080
Well, you could.

10:34.700 --> 10:42.180
For instance, relativity itself provides ways of doing it, but they have such special properties that they greatly restrict the numbers of plots that you can use.

10:43.300 --> 10:49.600
Do you find an awful lot of young writers sending material with this kind of boo-boo in it?

10:50.120 --> 10:51.640
This kind and many other kind.

10:52.100 --> 10:52.620
Yeah.

10:53.840 --> 11:04.580
You know, I've noticed in my own reading that there seems to be a good many stories that have interesting gimmicks to them, if you will, but are just terribly badly written.

11:05.300 --> 11:09.520
Now, if you have this kind of a situation, do you have difficulty in choosing?

11:09.760 --> 11:13.400
You've got a great plot, let's say, but a badly written story.

11:15.740 --> 11:24.220
Well, a little while ago, I think it was before we were actually taping, you asked something about, was I getting completely out of teaching?

11:24.900 --> 11:25.040
Yeah.

11:25.420 --> 11:34.080
And I said, yes, this is true in the sense that I have quit my job at the college in order to take this one.

11:34.820 --> 11:51.740
But in another sense, I haven't, because something which has been very prominent at analog farther back than I can remember firsthand is that one of the most important functions of the editor is to be a teacher, to look for the kind of thing that you see there.

11:51.860 --> 11:58.500
Now, it's a little hard to tell what to do if you get something in that has a really good idea and just plain bad writing.

11:59.760 --> 12:04.500
Bad writing of such a level that it indicates there's nothing you're going to be able to do about it with this writer.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.200
That I pretty much just have to pass up.

12:07.480 --> 12:20.260
But what I'm very much on the lookout for is what the second editor before me, John Campbell, who did an awful lot for the development of science fiction, is editor of this magazine.

12:21.400 --> 12:28.840
He said that the one thing that an editor has to do is to recognize a writer who hasn't learned to write.

12:30.020 --> 12:38.220
And this is something which I'm constantly on the lookout for in the slush pile, the pile of unsolicited manuscripts that come in from people that we don't know anything about.

12:41.260 --> 12:54.960
I'm probably safe to say that most writers have got their start by being found in that pile on somebody's desk with a story that has a good idea and almost but not quite good writing.

12:55.960 --> 13:02.000
The writing may be, it's literate at least, but there's something wrong with the storytelling.

13:02.600 --> 13:12.300
And in that case, I will take considerable pains to write to the editor to try to put into words what bothers me about the story as it stands.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.880
You would give the writer encouragement.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.540
And challenge him to find some way to fix it so that I like it.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.820
I try to avoid suggesting very specific changes.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.800
This is what I learned.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.560
I learned writing from the two previous editors, John Campbell and Ben Bova.

13:28.320 --> 13:37.640
And one of the most striking things about John Campbell's teaching technique to me was that he never told me how to change a story.

13:39.260 --> 13:44.640
He always said what was wrong with it, which is very hard to put into words sometimes.

13:44.740 --> 13:51.520
Sometimes it took me two days to figure out what he was saying in a letter, and then left it to me to figure out how to fix it.

13:51.700 --> 13:55.480
And I think I learned far more that way than by going through motions that he had spelled out.

13:56.180 --> 14:06.400
You mentioned the fact that you taught a science fiction course, and obviously there are more and more of that sort of course on college campuses around the country.

14:06.760 --> 14:13.660
You think they are going to be of real help in improving the quality of writing and science fiction writing in particular?

14:15.920 --> 14:20.040
Some of them will. A far larger number are unlikely to.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.420
In other words, you have it or you don't.

14:24.220 --> 14:26.920
There are a number of scary things about this.

14:27.100 --> 14:36.660
There are a lot of people in the science fiction business who are not at all sure they are too happy about the sudden academic respectability.

14:38.320 --> 14:42.240
Particularly since in some cases it becomes a matter of it being a fad.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.160
Science fiction courses are being offered in some places.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.620
Not all. There are some excellent courses being given.

14:49.620 --> 14:59.820
But I know that there are courses being given in some places simply because somebody besides the school over there has one, we have to have one too, and we need somebody to teach it.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.280
A couple of years ago a friend of mine called me up and said, help.

15:05.420 --> 15:08.240
And I asked for elaboration on this point.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.540
And she said, I've just been told that I'm going to teach a course in science fiction.

15:12.740 --> 15:16.280
And I said that I don't know anything about science fiction, and they said don't change the subject.

15:16.280 --> 15:21.020
And so she wanted to know if she could sit on a high course and try to learn something as she went.

15:21.800 --> 15:26.060
Now she at least was conscientious enough to try to learn something about it as she went.

15:26.500 --> 15:31.480
But there's a big background there. You can't become familiar with it that fast.

15:31.920 --> 15:35.280
That certainly would be the fad element that would end with it.

15:35.840 --> 15:40.100
We need a science fiction course that would look around for somebody who is, let's say, in the English department.

15:40.700 --> 15:45.320
Also, I think very few of the courses are taught by actual writers.

15:45.560 --> 15:50.060
Most courses are taught from a critics viewpoint rather than a writer's.

15:50.140 --> 15:53.840
And critics and writers tend to see things in fundamentally different ways.

15:54.220 --> 16:01.420
Even when the same person is active as both, he has a different set of ways of looking at things when he's acting as each one.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.400
You know, that's an interesting point.

16:03.400 --> 16:10.420
There aren't, or at least I have seldom read, good criticism of science fiction stories.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.000
Is there any such critic who is writing?

16:13.900 --> 16:18.560
There are a few. There are probably more now than before.

16:18.800 --> 16:28.420
There are also some others that I wouldn't want to recommend, but there's James Blish, A.J. Budris.

16:29.140 --> 16:31.900
I think Theodore Sturgeon has done some.

16:35.420 --> 16:40.580
But it's a field that seems to me there could be more done in, would be helpful.

16:41.600 --> 16:41.780
Yeah.

16:43.540 --> 16:50.380
Were you a physicist before you were a writer or vice versa, or did they both develop side by side?

16:50.380 --> 16:51.180
Well, let's see.

16:52.120 --> 16:56.420
At what point do I qualify as a writer or a physicist?

16:57.600 --> 17:09.320
I sold my first stories while I was in graduate school as a physicist, before I got the graduate degree, before I was employed as a physicist.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.100
But I already had the undergraduate degree.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.340
So, I don't know.

17:16.180 --> 17:23.320
Would you say that the physics had been really tremendously helpful to you as a science fiction writer?

17:23.320 --> 17:30.880
Could you have done as well, perhaps, if your background was in biology or some non-science?

17:31.220 --> 17:34.680
A science fiction writer has to have some background in virtually all fields.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.080
That's one of the things that makes it so interesting to me.

17:37.260 --> 17:40.620
Can you pick that up from just reading, or do you really have to study the field?

17:42.440 --> 17:45.180
You may have to read about it in quite a bit of depth.

17:45.180 --> 17:56.800
And I think there is a tendency to be able to treat things with a kind of depth that you do have the deeper background in, that you couldn't with other fields.

17:57.140 --> 18:06.080
So, I could have had some other kind of background, and I might have done as well at writing, but I couldn't have written the same stories.

18:07.100 --> 18:12.120
For instance, Lifeboat Earth, in a sense it's a collection of stories.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.320
Really, the stories all form one larger story.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.280
As a matter of fact, that book itself forms part of a still larger story.

18:20.940 --> 18:33.700
But the Lifeboat Earth sequence itself is one that I don't see how somebody without a pretty fair knowledge of physics and astronomy could have even attempted to write.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.500
Because I had to do a lot of very detailed working out of background.

18:39.420 --> 18:43.900
That's a good example, by the way, of one of the things that I try to stress.

18:44.020 --> 18:50.140
You were asking what kinds of things I look for in stories, and I was talking about how the science fits into the fiction.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.600
Let me put it another way.

18:53.760 --> 19:14.060
I'm looking for stories which are people stories, but they're about people and situations which grow directly out of the speculative elements in such a way that you can't separate the two.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.920
Lifeboat Earth is an example of this.

19:18.360 --> 19:28.360
It's very much a people story, but the situation that the people find themselves in is that as the result of a core explosion in this galaxy,

19:30.200 --> 19:37.180
which this was mentioned in an earlier book, actually, Lifeboat Earth is a sequel to a novel called The Sins of the Fathers.

19:38.040 --> 19:48.780
Anyway, in Lifeboat Earth, with the aid of some intelligent extraterrestrials, Earth itself is being used as a sort of a spaceship,

19:49.460 --> 19:55.940
and it's being moved to another galaxy to escape the core explosion in this galaxy.

19:56.920 --> 20:04.480
And so what I have is a story of people set against the background of all the changes that are occurring in the Earth as a result of this trip.

20:05.900 --> 20:14.500
Now, I don't know how well I've succeeded, but to even hope to be halfway convincing about this, you have to be able to work out what some of those changes would be.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.980
And some of them are quite different from what you might expect intuitively.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.140
And I know I put a lot of work into doing that.

20:23.340 --> 20:32.140
Some of it was involved enough that at one point I went out and bought a programmable pocket calculator so that it could work out some of the astronomical background of it for me.

20:32.140 --> 20:42.420
Now, there's an idea like that. Is that generated possibly by something you had read in a physics book or studied in a technical manual of some part?

20:44.380 --> 20:50.380
Or did it start out more with the people situation of what if type of thing?

20:50.380 --> 20:57.120
I want to remember this whole thing, which so far is up to about 150,000 words and still growing.

20:57.800 --> 21:05.220
Originally started out as a very insignificant short story, which a good editor bounced and said, but now what can you build on it?

21:06.880 --> 21:12.160
See, being on both sides of the fence, I can even admit from the writer's viewpoint that editors are sometimes good for something.

21:16.180 --> 21:27.180
I believe there I had one technical idea, and I didn't really know what to do with it.

21:27.380 --> 21:31.240
The technical idea there is one that doesn't even show up in what I mentioned so far.

21:31.240 --> 21:47.440
It's just the idea that if you had a way of traveling faster than light, you could intercept radio messages, for instance, which you had missed the first time around because your receiver wasn't working just by going out and catching up with them.

21:52.840 --> 21:56.380
That was the basis of the original insignificant short story.

21:58.620 --> 22:17.420
And that got combined with some other things. There was another idea that I had had independently that the question of suppose somebody told us that the earth and could more or less prove that the earth was going to become uninhabitable in a certain relative way.

22:17.420 --> 22:21.560
A relatively small number of years. What, if anything, would we do about it?

22:23.620 --> 22:32.160
And the whole situation that is now in the verge of becoming a trilogy grew out of those two ideas coming together.

22:33.340 --> 22:40.920
This is something which has happened to me a couple of times, and I know it happens to other writers too, that sometimes you have two ideas, neither one of which will do anything by itself.

22:41.260 --> 22:44.400
But if you put them together, they write a story almost spontaneously.

22:44.400 --> 22:57.160
Do you feel when you're writing a story like that, that it is totally separated from current reality, or are you influenced by real contemporary threats to our civilization?

22:59.600 --> 23:10.360
It can vary. It depends on a lot on the individual story. I'd say this one was more influenced by contemporary things because it's a relatively near future story.

23:11.000 --> 23:23.380
I wasn't thinking of it particularly in response to any present threats, although in another sense I could see where you could draw if you wanted to some sort of allegorical connection.

23:24.600 --> 23:39.180
Because this type of problem is very similar to a lot of the problems that science fiction writers have been talking about for years, and normal people are just now beginning to realize they really have to think about.

23:39.180 --> 23:53.140
That is the type of long range problem, which you don't need a solution to right now, but it's so big that even if you start right now, you're going to be hard put to have a solution by the time you need it.

23:54.220 --> 23:57.540
And the newspapers every day are full of problems of that type now.

24:00.160 --> 24:14.420
The market for short stories in general has been shrinking over the years. Do you think that analog for one has a very important role to play in preserving a market for the short story?

24:15.180 --> 24:24.540
Yes, as a matter of fact, it has shrumped to the point where science fiction magazines may well be the biggest market for short stories.

24:25.820 --> 24:40.700
But there are so few of them at this point that we're getting a sort of a positive feedback, vicious circle type of thing, where there are so few markets and usually such low paying markets for short stories

24:41.300 --> 24:50.380
that most writers, after they become a little bit experienced and a little bit known, realize that if they're going to make any money, short stories aren't the way to do it.

24:51.040 --> 24:54.540
And they pretty much quit writing short stories and go off and write novels instead.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.780
Not always as good as their short stories.

24:59.360 --> 25:03.380
No, some people can handle one very well, not the other.

25:04.020 --> 25:08.160
Do you think there's any hope for the short story in magazine form in the future?

25:09.220 --> 25:14.800
I hope so. I'd like to see the market for it expand.

25:16.800 --> 25:26.560
Thank you very much for talking with us today. Stanley Schmidt, Science Fiction Writer and new editor of the magazine Analog. Thank you very much.
