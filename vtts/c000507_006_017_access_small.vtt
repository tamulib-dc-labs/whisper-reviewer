Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.740 --> 00:34.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.400
And here are your hosts.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.240
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.180
Gene Wolff's popular science fiction series, The Book of the New Son, was published between

00:48.180 --> 00:49.340
1980 and 1982.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.980
The series consists of four novels, The Shadow of the Torturer, The Claw of the Consiliator,

00:54.320 --> 00:56.660
The Sword of the Lictor, and The Citadel of the Autark.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.240
All four books concern a character named Severian, who belongs to a torturer's guild in the

01:01.240 --> 01:02.140
far future of Earth.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.080
Though each volume is a complete novel, they should be read in order, since Severian's

01:06.080 --> 01:08.600
character develops and changes as the narrative progresses.

01:09.100 --> 01:12.720
Severian starts off as a forbidding character, dressed in a black robe and hood.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.800
He works as a torturer, but his profession also includes acting as an executioner.

01:17.340 --> 01:19.680
Accordingly, he carries a huge sword for chopping off heads.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.000
We asked Wolff if there was any impetus behind the four novels of The Book of the New Son.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.820
Well, there are a number of things that go together.

01:30.360 --> 01:39.840
Things come together to create a book or to create the idea in the loose sense for a book.

01:41.960 --> 01:47.300
In this case, I'm not sure that I can name anything terribly dramatic.

01:48.320 --> 01:56.400
One of the things that happened was that I was at a science fiction convention, and

01:57.360 --> 02:04.900
I attended a panel on costuming for the science fiction masquerade.

02:05.800 --> 02:16.700
As I listened to the various expert costumers talk about how they did it and so forth, it occurred to me that nobody had ever done one of my characters as far as I knew.

02:17.260 --> 02:19.660
Of course, I started to soak about that.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.720
Then I thought of what the characters looked like.

02:24.420 --> 02:33.420
It occurred to me that one reason that no one had done it was that I did not have very many characters who wore dramatic and interesting clothes.

02:35.100 --> 02:41.980
While I was sitting there in the panel, I kind of designed Severian's outfit for him.

02:43.240 --> 02:50.120
With very few changes, it went into the book in that form.

02:51.300 --> 02:57.360
The cloak, trousers, boots, bare chest, the mask, and so forth.

02:57.960 --> 03:06.440
A part of it was just the idea sparked by the panel that trying to achieve a dramatic visual effect.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.580
It seems strange to have a torturer as the main character of a science fiction novel.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.460
A figure after all that doesn't fit the normal heroic pattern.

03:31.460 --> 03:39.460
What I wanted to do was to take someone who was not obviously a hero.

03:40.320 --> 03:48.300
We have done an awful lot of writing about people who are clearly heroes in the popular mind.

03:49.700 --> 03:53.920
Private detectives, fighter pilots, and whatnot.

03:53.920 --> 04:04.000
I wanted to take someone who was a villain in the popular mind and use him as my hero, as my central character.

04:05.520 --> 04:18.200
Obviously, a torturer and executioner, which Severian as well as a torturer at various parts of the book, is such a character.

04:18.860 --> 04:21.360
He was the one that I fastened on.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.620
But Severian also seems to be a decent person.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.640
I think that's precisely true.

04:28.340 --> 04:41.400
If he had been a thoroughgoing villain, then there would have been no real purpose as far as I'm concerned in dealing with him in the book.

04:41.400 --> 04:52.440
What I wanted to show was that a person could find himself in some such situation and yet be fundamentally a decent man.

04:53.220 --> 04:55.080
More next time with Gene Wolfe.

05:02.060 --> 05:10.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:16.540 --> 06:21.860
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.140
And here are your hosts.

06:30.340 --> 06:31.540
This is David Carson.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.380
And Daryl Lange.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.940
Gene Wolfe's book of the new Sun series is a highly literate and complex work.

06:36.320 --> 06:43.120
Wolfe, for example, likes to include allusions to famous works of literature, and he often uses the traditional literary device of the tale within a tale.

06:43.580 --> 06:51.220
This happens when he suspends his narrative about Severian the torturer and tells another sort of story altogether, usually a tale with a clear moral point to it.

06:51.220 --> 06:53.380
We ask Wolfe why he used this technique so often.

07:21.220 --> 07:31.140
And also sort of divide the book, separate the first half from the second half when it seems desirable to do that.

07:31.860 --> 07:40.500
I did that in the Claw of the Consiliator, for example, in which the tale of the student in the sun comes right at the center of the book.

07:40.660 --> 07:50.080
And it's also in sort of the Lictor where the tale of the boy called Frog is in the middle of the book and essentially is splitting the half.

07:50.080 --> 08:04.020
And you can also use it to reveal character sometimes, as I did, for example, in the first book where I had the various people in the hospital each tell a story.

08:04.960 --> 08:08.700
This is very, very old literary technique.

08:09.060 --> 08:13.460
It goes back to the Middle Ages, at least perhaps beyond that for all I know.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.880
You can use it to foreshadow things.

08:18.700 --> 08:38.120
You can also use it to show parts of the society that would not otherwise be seen as I tried to give a glimpse of Foila's life on the Pampas in the story, in the fourth book, The Cemetery of the Artarch.

08:38.960 --> 08:46.280
Volume one of the four volumes series, The Shadow of the Torturer, introduces a character named Baldander, who is literally a giant with immense physical powers.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.780
We wondered if there were any models behind Baldander's.

09:16.280 --> 09:32.780
In the book of Imaginary Beings by George Louis Bore, who describes a monster called Baldander, who was a shape changer as the tritons and proteas and so forth, were supposed to be.

09:33.380 --> 09:43.060
And I thought it was a good name for a character who continued to grow indefinitely, which is what Baldander does.

09:43.980 --> 09:50.700
In the third volume, The Sword of the Lictor, Severian and Baldander's fight, Severian uses his sword in the Giant Baldander's a club.

09:51.240 --> 09:55.440
This sort of fight is reminiscent of narratives of the Middle Ages in which a knight battles an evil giant.

09:56.680 --> 10:07.360
The image that I wanted, the jacket and the giant killer image, with the castle and the tower and so forth.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.080
Wolf also refers to other science fiction and fantasy writers.

10:11.540 --> 10:16.840
We found echoes of Jack Vance, for instance, in the book of the New Sun series, particularly to Vance's classic, The Dying Earth.

10:17.500 --> 10:29.060
I owe a great deal to Jack Vance. I'm not about to deny it. I love The Dying Earth. I read it. I don't know how many times. Probably four or five times, sincerely.

10:29.060 --> 10:36.580
And, yeah, it's in many ways the same type of story.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.200
Moros Jean Wolf, next time.

10:46.400 --> 10:55.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:43.800 --> 11:47.720
Coming up next is The Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:03.740 --> 12:08.840
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.160
And here are your hosts.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.400
This is Daryl Lane.

12:18.580 --> 12:19.300
And David Carson.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.200
Gene Wolfe's Science Fiction series, The Book of the New Sun, consists of four novels,

12:23.420 --> 12:25.320
set in what appears to be the far future of Earth.

12:25.320 --> 12:29.680
In order, the four novels are the Shadow of the Torturer, the Claw of the Consiliator,

12:29.980 --> 12:32.380
the Sword of the Lictor, and the Citadel of the Autarch.

12:32.760 --> 12:36.880
The overriding notion of the four volumes is the concept of the New Sun, a future time

12:36.880 --> 12:39.620
of salvation when the Earth will be cleansed in a new start made.

12:40.140 --> 12:42.180
This almost seems to be a religious concept.

12:42.440 --> 12:45.420
We ask Wolfe if the Book of the New Sun was indeed a religious work.

12:45.420 --> 12:52.880
The way this impart a religious work, it certainly isn't wholly a religious work.

12:53.460 --> 13:03.400
What I tried to do in the book was touch upon the things that I thought were important

13:04.360 --> 13:05.900
to mankind.

13:07.330 --> 13:13.880
One of the important things is saving the Earth, which is something that we have only

13:13.880 --> 13:19.000
in this century have realized that it needed saving, but we now realize that it does.

13:19.700 --> 13:23.940
And in the Earth as it is, it's very apparent that it does.

13:24.700 --> 13:30.720
If something isn't done, something positive, not just the kind of thing that we have where

13:30.720 --> 13:36.600
perhaps we could save it if we would refrain from poisoning the sea and killing the whale,

13:37.440 --> 13:41.520
but if something positive is done, the planet is going to freeze.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.660
Another important element in human life is religion.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.200
And so I tried to touch on that.

13:50.980 --> 14:00.440
I also tried to touch on the family, on raising children and whatnot at various places in the book.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.240
Wolfe says it took him five years to finish the four volumes in the series.

14:29.780 --> 14:32.460
After an effort like that, we asked him what he could do for an encore.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.100
Well, I'm not sure that I'm going to be called upon for an encore.

14:38.320 --> 14:44.740
I am trying to do the coda, and I have another novel in the work, a completely unrelated novel.

14:46.080 --> 14:53.940
I'm not sure that there will be people who will say that the book of the new sun is the best thing I've ever done.

14:54.620 --> 15:02.240
There are people who say that peace is the best thing I've ever done, and there are people who say that the fifth head of service is the best thing I've ever done.

15:03.180 --> 15:06.220
I just try and do each book as well as I can.

15:07.280 --> 15:12.900
Wolfe is working on a fifth volume which will describe what happens to Severian, the protagonist of the first four volumes.

15:13.260 --> 15:17.240
We wondered if that fifth volume would be a simple background work, rather than the full-length narrative.

15:18.340 --> 15:29.880
Well, I think that if you want to reduce any story, any work to the lowest common denominator, you can do that.

15:30.580 --> 15:39.280
I assume that you could take warranties and do it as a soap opera or a romance novel or something.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.440
But I don't think that that's necessarily the best way to do it.

15:44.000 --> 15:55.460
I think that a novel should be written in a way that is compatible to its subject matter.

15:56.140 --> 16:05.100
And I was writing about a very old society with a very complicated history.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.300
I won't say that the society is complex.

16:07.900 --> 16:14.040
I don't think it's as complex as ours now, but its history is much more complex than ours.

16:14.340 --> 16:22.940
And I tried to do that in a way and with the tone that I thought was appropriate to the setting.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.940
We'll continue our conversation with Gene Wolfe on our next show.

16:34.020 --> 16:39.090
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:39.720 --> 16:42.640
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:34.100 --> 17:38.040
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:54.100 --> 17:59.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:02.060 --> 18:03.500
And here are your hosts.

18:07.780 --> 18:09.780
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

18:10.140 --> 18:13.420
Gene Wolfe has been publishing highly regarded science fiction for a number of years,

18:13.720 --> 18:17.080
but his best known work is the recent four volume series, The Book of the New Son.

18:17.460 --> 18:21.440
When we spoke with Wolfe recently, we asked him if he had been a serious science fiction fan as a young reader.

18:22.060 --> 18:29.140
I wasn't a fan in the sense of being a member of fandom, but when I was growing up, fandom was very, very small.

18:31.420 --> 18:34.500
I graduated from high school in 1949.

18:36.180 --> 18:45.080
I was reading, I read the first paperback science fiction anthology that was ever printed.

18:45.580 --> 18:48.560
It was my introduction to science fiction.

18:49.320 --> 18:53.720
I read the old science fiction pulp magazines like Starling Stories,

18:54.280 --> 18:57.440
Berlin Wunderstories, until they went out of existence.

18:58.260 --> 19:01.980
So I was an early reader of science fiction, yeah.

19:02.480 --> 19:09.160
But I never went to a science fiction convention until the World Con in St. Louis, which I think was 1960.

19:10.660 --> 19:13.100
He explains how he started to write science fiction.

19:14.400 --> 19:19.260
Really, I was looking for a way to make some money on the side over and above my salary.

19:19.980 --> 19:24.860
I had written for College Magazine while I was at Texas A&M,

19:25.640 --> 19:32.400
and it occurred to me that I might be able to write some material and sell it and bring in a little extreme income.

19:33.060 --> 19:37.160
My wife and I were living in a two room furnished apartment at the time.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.460
We'd just been married. We neither of us had any money.

19:39.960 --> 19:45.200
And we had to have enough money to make a down payment on furniture before we could get out of it.

19:46.420 --> 19:53.780
Writing did not turn out to be the source of quick money that I hoped it would at the time,

19:53.940 --> 19:57.100
but I guess I caught the bug and I've kept up with it.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.440
Wolfe has a degree in mechanical engineering.

20:00.860 --> 20:05.320
With that sort of background, you might have expected him to write hard science fiction, full of technology and gadgets.

20:05.320 --> 20:10.920
But he doesn't. His science fiction is psychologically oriented and highly literary in style. We asked him why.

20:12.040 --> 20:16.940
I don't know except anything I would say would be speculation.

20:17.700 --> 20:20.560
Perhaps because I deal with it daily.

20:21.760 --> 20:26.180
I'm anxious to get away from it for a while when I'm at the typewriter.

20:26.780 --> 20:28.700
That's about the only thing I can get.

20:28.700 --> 20:35.060
You have to remember now that when I'm writing the book of the new sun or whatever,

20:35.840 --> 20:46.680
I've been spending the previous day writing articles about hydraulic systems or welding machines or something along those lines.

20:47.780 --> 20:53.900
And now for plant engineering, I'm doing a series of three articles on industrial robots, for example.

20:56.120 --> 21:02.360
And although I certainly have nothing against robots or welding machines or hydraulics,

21:03.020 --> 21:10.300
you don't want to live and breathe any one thing all the time, or at least I don't think that I did.

21:11.560 --> 21:16.640
Wolfe's book of the new sun, the four volume series about Severi and the Torturer, took him five years to complete.

21:17.100 --> 21:20.160
We wondered if writing was a great strain on him since he doesn't do it full time.

21:20.160 --> 21:26.460
Yeah, it's difficult, but if you're a tennis player, I think it's difficult to play good tennis.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.200
I'm not a tennis player, goodness.

21:29.180 --> 21:35.580
But you may nevertheless enjoy playing tennis, particularly if you do it well,

21:35.680 --> 21:38.240
or at least you're able to convince yourself that you do it well.

21:39.520 --> 21:43.380
And I enjoy writing. It's hard, it's hard work.

21:44.780 --> 21:50.120
It's not hard work compared to digging a big hole in hard ground on a hot day,

21:50.580 --> 21:58.060
but it's hard work in the sense that we normally talk about hard work, which is perhaps a little childish of it.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.840
But still it's something that I like to do.

22:02.880 --> 22:08.120
As for paying a price, you know, what would I be doing with that time?

22:08.120 --> 22:15.760
If I were not writing, watching reruns of Mesh on TV or something of the sort,

22:16.360 --> 22:21.980
and I really don't find that sort of thing all that rewarding.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.940
More next time with Gene Wolfe.

22:31.940 --> 22:34.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:34.720 --> 22:37.440
production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:37.720 --> 22:40.640
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:26.520 --> 23:30.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:46.480 --> 23:51.800
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.120
And here are your hosts.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.360
This is Daryl Lane.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.220
And David Carson.

24:02.640 --> 24:07.580
The Science Fiction author Gene Wolfe is probably best known for his fascinating four-volume series, The Book of the New Sun.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.940
He also writes fine short stories in novellas.

24:10.440 --> 24:13.040
Two collections of his shorter fiction have been published so far,

24:13.480 --> 24:17.760
The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories and Other Stories, and Gene Wolfe's Book of Days.

24:18.260 --> 24:20.780
There are some interesting facts surrounding one of his shorter pieces,

24:21.160 --> 24:22.860
The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories.

24:22.860 --> 24:28.020
It's about a boy named Taki, who's reading a science fiction story entitled, The Island of Doctor Death.

24:28.460 --> 24:32.200
He becomes so enthralled by the story, and his own existence is so unattractive to him,

24:32.560 --> 24:35.760
that the characters in the narrative leave the story and become part of his real life.

24:36.120 --> 24:40.740
One of the interesting facts concerning the story is that it's written in the very rare second-person point of view.

24:40.940 --> 24:42.380
We asked Wolfe why he wrote it that way.

24:43.280 --> 24:47.540
I think largely as an experiment, I wanted to see if it could be done.

24:47.540 --> 25:00.660
I needed a very distinct way of setting off the material in the book, The Island of Doctor Death,

25:00.900 --> 25:07.100
which is the book that the boy Taki is reading in the story, from Taki's own story.

25:07.100 --> 25:18.280
And that was the strongest way of contrasting the two elements that I could come up with.

25:18.520 --> 25:27.080
I needed the very strong contrast in order to get the shock effect when the characters from the book that Taki was reading

25:27.080 --> 25:33.060
actually appeared in his own life, Captain Ransom and Doctor Death himself and so forth.

25:34.060 --> 25:37.320
One of the themes of the story is the difference between fantasy and reality.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.340
We asked Wolfe if he meant for the reader to choose one or the other.

25:41.080 --> 25:54.180
No, what I was trying to say, I think, was that the kind of literature that people tend perhaps to criticize children for having and reading

25:54.180 --> 26:05.800
is actually healthier and more straightforward in most cases than the world in which the children are actually living.

26:06.740 --> 26:17.740
So I took this The Island with the monster race, the ancient monster race and the mad scientist and so forth,

26:17.740 --> 26:27.360
and contrasted that with Taki's actual life experience with his mother and the mother's boyfriend and the party and so forth.

26:34.100 --> 26:39.320
Another interesting fact about The Island of Doctor Death and other stories is the two stories that Wolfe wrote soon afterwards.

26:40.120 --> 26:44.400
One is entitled The Death of Doctor Island and the other is called The Doctor of Death Island.

26:44.660 --> 26:46.420
We asked Wolfe why he wrote these other two.

26:46.420 --> 26:59.680
I get the mixed up myself. The Death of Doctor Island was simply that I was talking to Joe Hensley and The Island of Doctor Death and other stories had lost,

26:59.780 --> 27:09.640
pardon me, The Island of Doctor Death and other stories, had lost the nebula and it had lost to no award.

27:09.640 --> 27:17.020
So I started to see on the history and the history of science fiction writers of America to lose that award, to no award.

27:18.120 --> 27:24.460
Joe Hensley said, you should write one called The Death of Doctor Island and that would win now for sure.

27:25.300 --> 27:31.220
And he said that this is a joke of course. And I thought, well, he thinks I can't do it and I thought I can do it.

27:31.220 --> 27:43.600
So I started thinking about what kind of a story would go with that title, who Doctor Island might be and what the Death of Doctor Island might be and so forth.

27:44.060 --> 27:45.260
And came up with that story.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.820
And then why did he go on to write The Doctor of Death Island?

27:49.400 --> 28:00.560
Well, I wanted to see if I could do it again. People kept coming up to me and giving me various switches on that title because the business with the titles got a number of people fancied.

28:00.560 --> 28:13.160
And so I thought, well, I'll try it again and see if I can do it a third time. And I could. But it was sufficiently difficult that I didn't get terribly interested in trying to do it a fourth time.

28:20.500 --> 28:29.360
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:51.020 --> 28:51.860
Thank you.
