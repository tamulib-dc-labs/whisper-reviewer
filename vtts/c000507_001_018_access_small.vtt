00:01.320 --> 00:06.140
This subject was touched upon by last year's guest of honor, the attention of Paul Anderson.

00:07.360 --> 00:12.140
And he made it his central subject I should find myself with no problem with my hands.

00:13.020 --> 00:19.280
Paul's own subject was an appeal for a unitary approach to science fiction, in which philosophy,

00:19.960 --> 00:28.940
love, technology, poetry, and the elements of daily life all played in important and roughly equal roles.

00:30.240 --> 00:38.480
Now, this is an ideal prescription for good science fiction, but it's a good prescription only because it is good for fiction to hold.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.880
And indeed no good fiction of any kind has ever been produced in any other way.

00:44.540 --> 00:47.000
And I feel safe in saying that none ever will.

00:47.700 --> 00:57.460
One side of novels may be Sapphire or Allegory or T-Nobble, that kind of novel where you don't know what's going on,

00:57.460 --> 01:01.660
until you discover that the character named Horace Nils Fitz Campbell is really Henry Luce.

01:03.720 --> 01:10.060
But there are never complete novels for rare exceptions, and they have about as much lasting power as these clean necks.

01:11.260 --> 01:17.940
This description is the most science fiction very well, and Paul did a very thorough job of expanding upon it.

01:17.940 --> 01:34.500
But it seems to me that Paul's utilitarian principle also goes a long way toward explaining why popular or critical successes like the 1984 play of piano, limbo, raising world, styles of the unborn, and so on,

01:35.200 --> 01:39.100
never increase our audience or the prestige of our idiom.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.340
We have asked ourselves time and time again why this is free.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.720
I think I have an answer, I'm not sure.

01:45.720 --> 01:49.940
When these books turn on gimmicks which to us are old and stale,

01:50.700 --> 01:55.620
and usually they handle those gimmicks clumsily and with varying degrees of naivety.

01:56.580 --> 02:06.840
If they command an audience with respect, which are much more fearful and experienced practitioners like I, Paul or Pruitsunax, can't even get close to it.

02:06.840 --> 02:15.820
Orwell had no reputation for novels to have written only one, keep the affidavit for flying, and drew a red bump, and everybody said it was dreadful.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.440
What I'm trying to do is virtually unknown.

02:20.680 --> 02:23.060
Nevertheless, these successes can be accounted for.

02:23.820 --> 02:29.740
Each of these outside authors can be seen to be thinking about something.

02:31.120 --> 02:37.960
George Orwell was nothing from pushing around the devices of that old plot about the future asian type despotism,

02:38.680 --> 02:41.780
in the hopes of finding an annual pression after self-care.

02:42.520 --> 02:48.000
He had had some fundamental to say, the things about which the great philosophical problems of all time,

02:48.940 --> 02:52.800
the nature of the relationship between the individual and the state.

02:54.220 --> 03:00.180
And it is small wonder that people, particularly in our time, smashed up that book with the name of Reginald Hammond.

03:01.240 --> 03:07.300
It is of no importance to Orwell's futureist devices, but to a little seeding,

03:07.680 --> 03:10.620
and still what a little seeding is a dream full of day specialists.

03:11.700 --> 03:16.020
What is important is the proposition he set out to show us,

03:16.100 --> 03:19.440
perhaps the most important contribution by an artist to this problem,

03:19.440 --> 03:24.600
since the South Queen wrote the Antiquity, and perhaps the first original text proposition since then.

03:25.800 --> 03:30.300
This proposition, which is the drive deal of 1984, is only six words wrong.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.220
This is not just six words.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.460
The purpose of power is power.

03:36.740 --> 03:41.980
Not wealth, not luxury, not fame, not a woman of day,

03:42.420 --> 03:47.560
and will certainly not the public welfare, make it enjoyment of power for its own sake.

03:48.860 --> 03:58.340
The most of the kind of people who are attracted to politics, power is not a means to another end, but is in itself the great possible audience.

03:59.440 --> 04:07.740
This is a pretty bloodthirsty notion, precisely because so much history has been supported, particularly recent entries,

04:08.420 --> 04:17.360
but not only is it sharp, it commands attention, and what is the last and the first machines in the very same chapter can possibly do.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.900
I have one more example, and then I will pass on.

04:21.080 --> 04:23.720
There is one last, pretty much the same sort of question.

04:24.580 --> 04:28.440
In this case, it read, person immortality for what?

04:29.200 --> 04:33.600
In Star of the Unborn, you will recall, people didn't die.

04:34.380 --> 04:44.280
They were scientifically changed into a sort of vegetable organism, and planted, so that in effect they lived forever, assuming I suppose somebody else wanted them.

04:45.520 --> 04:49.660
The process sometimes went awry and produced monstrosities.

04:50.740 --> 04:53.700
These things were irreversible, they were just thrown away.

04:54.500 --> 05:01.160
Monstrosities had a tendency, too, to resemble whatever character defect a man had in his original life.

05:01.160 --> 05:08.280
A grasping man, for instance, might turn into a huge, flopping hand and arm, and so on, and you can see the possible audience.

05:09.660 --> 05:13.260
Here again, personally, it's more challenging than a flesh.

05:14.020 --> 05:18.760
It's an old science fiction subject, which I have written about myself until have you all.

05:19.820 --> 05:24.180
But the question of what has to be done with all those years, has been comes up.

05:25.360 --> 05:32.900
What it does, there is usually a little ritual about how wonderful it would be to have all those lifetimes to become experts in some subjects,

05:33.720 --> 05:35.940
or to pursue some gigantic project.

05:36.660 --> 05:41.820
A person with just 90 probable, or one person out of a thousand, or maybe even 100,000,

05:42.140 --> 05:46.660
for the rest of this, the chances are much better than the simply wither of dependence.

05:47.660 --> 06:01.320
Or vegetate mindfully, like veritable flowers, will become more and more civil-mindedly and monstrously the same kind of cripple or sinner that we've learned in our godfather's 70 years.

06:02.500 --> 06:10.220
For a veritable, who was a carpenter, it was perfectly obvious that human psyche isn't built to take the immortality of the flesh.

06:10.980 --> 06:15.940
To me, an agnostic, this conclusion seems one and a percent right.

06:17.260 --> 06:24.080
So now, we have all well talking about the problem of power, fun and good about the problem of gold,

06:25.040 --> 06:27.620
and careful about the problem of time and mortality.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.900
All these books are about some things.

06:31.740 --> 06:38.900
I submit to you, very few science fiction stories even the very best of them are about them.

06:39.700 --> 06:45.560
And that in this sense, they fail to hold unitary tests in the worst possible way.

06:46.580 --> 06:54.220
For all their ingenuity and detail, and their sweetness as exercises, they show new signs of thinking.

06:55.240 --> 06:59.860
And by that, I mean thinking about others that mean something to everyone,

07:00.280 --> 07:05.340
not just about whether or not a match with a risen situation is a rapidly-togetherness, but yes.

07:06.360 --> 07:15.600
And that happens when a general reader, fascinated by fun and good or a veritable or whoever, steps into our field from more of the same.

07:16.960 --> 07:24.500
You may very well notice that what he is now reading is more adjoined in some ways, that one game is going to last him long.

07:26.020 --> 07:32.140
General readers and critics may be taken in temporarily by small ingenuities which are new to them,

07:32.760 --> 07:38.480
but only temporarily. That is not the kind of thing they admire in fiction, nor should that.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.200
Nor are they seeking to have their things in one stimulated.

07:42.340 --> 07:50.760
The genuine sense of wonder, which is a piece of standard equipment in the human brain, can get along very well on what is coming in place to the destructible.

07:51.440 --> 07:56.960
It does not need to be bludgeoned by an endless succession of concocted and visibly spurious models.

07:57.720 --> 08:04.360
Anti-matter, galactic coercions, and numbers of long chains of zeroes, actually do have their fascination.

08:05.520 --> 08:11.480
A new one is newly is all-inspiring, as a five-year-old girl who happens to be yours.

08:13.420 --> 08:20.400
The only name of the science fiction time can be rewarded in headlines for having come to this big time and come out four squares in favor of Particle.

08:21.300 --> 08:28.300
Both saying it is true that wonders are made, but none so wonderful as mine.

08:28.900 --> 08:40.080
Yet you may read several hundred science fiction stories a year without finding where they are, which reflects any consciousness of its banal and ancient axiom.

08:40.760 --> 08:54.900
The writer or reader who still thinks the next building star is inherited more wonderful than the mind and heart of the man who wonders at it himself, is going to learn out of these political wonders sooner or later.

08:55.960 --> 09:02.460
And then perhaps he will blame the readers for the writers of the effort of the divided public we have seen this process going on a long time.

09:03.420 --> 09:12.080
What he is now seeking from fiction of all time, science fiction included, is not the sense of wonder, but the sense of conviction.

09:13.520 --> 09:22.360
The feeling, the story you are reading, is about something that is worth your adult attention and is the author approaching in that light.

09:24.080 --> 09:32.760
Some few works of great science fiction are as serious and rewarding as anything the author might have attempted outside our field.

09:33.300 --> 09:38.780
Childhoods and more than human both pass my proposed test my discipline.

09:39.480 --> 09:49.980
But I have the awful feeling that many of us continue to read science fiction and to write it for no better reason than that it is comfortable and safe.

09:50.740 --> 09:57.140
No matter how outlandish it looks to outsiders, we can deal with it and we'll use it.

09:58.140 --> 10:08.740
And I think it is manifestly impossible to write well about any subject that you regard as comfortable and safe, for to read it well is comfort and safety at what you see.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.960
Food science fiction is neither.

10:13.920 --> 10:21.560
It is precisely the science fiction story that ratting people's teeth and chasing their convictions, that finds its way into the mainstream.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.700
This is the essence of the difference.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.920
And by this I don't mean an icon smashing.

10:28.100 --> 10:36.460
I personally feel quite certain that people will still be reading Ted Sturgeon on the variety and nature of the love relationship.

10:37.660 --> 10:44.780
Longing after the advertising boys have brought their final offence and gone home, there are no longer they are available to be satirized.

10:45.640 --> 10:53.560
Just as they still leave the brothers' car mouth off, the morning the open uncle comes having all they want with them in the same year.

10:55.860 --> 10:56.820
Slavery is dead.

10:57.380 --> 11:01.380
The problems discussed in the brothers are still with us and they all will be.

11:01.380 --> 11:09.500
And we have reached the stage where our physical horizons can't be expanded much more without bursting a bubble of the physical universe.

11:10.460 --> 11:15.220
The ethical, the moral, the philosophical horizons remain.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.660
And those are infinite.

11:18.720 --> 11:28.040
And it is fair, I believe, that the realm of good science fiction must lie before its death and the inferential clues that come directly to the same conclusion.

11:28.040 --> 11:28.820
I quote,

11:30.100 --> 11:32.500
When you're suspending reality, you will die.

11:33.520 --> 11:41.100
By the signs of the rocket ship and the ray gun and the time machine, we indicate the relationship between us is nothing to do with the real world.

11:41.940 --> 11:45.640
By writing the stuff and by reading it, we advocate for action.

11:46.260 --> 11:49.620
We give free play to our unconscious drive and symbols.

11:49.620 --> 11:56.960
We write and read not about the real world, but about ourselves and things within ourselves.

11:58.040 --> 12:02.060
This is true, but it is not all true.

12:03.060 --> 12:07.140
The real world is not different from what we have inside our skulls.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.240
In fact, all we know about the real world is inside our skulls.

12:11.380 --> 12:14.620
The phycotomy which Cheryl describes is not a real phycotomy.

12:14.620 --> 12:17.660
We don't need phycotomy.

12:18.620 --> 12:20.440
It is all in the head.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.040
And that's where it must go.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.100
Otherwise, it is just gadgetry and talk.

12:28.860 --> 12:38.900
The basic thing in terms of what Cata May on bars earns, my visual world speech teacher used to tell me that I must never leave an audience with a general point,

12:39.660 --> 12:43.540
but my soul was provided them with some action they might take if they agreed with me.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.680
If it happens, I have one handed.

12:46.540 --> 12:55.820
The only question I have to deal with is that for any kind of impulse, it can be exerted on what gets written, on what gets thought-finding,

12:55.980 --> 12:58.660
but what gets written is in the river voting.

13:00.420 --> 13:06.980
Next year, when the magic time comes around, and we will lay down to the rest of five or ten possible categories,

13:07.660 --> 13:11.520
and particularly in the novel, because this is where the influence gets made.

13:13.800 --> 13:19.420
I suggest that you put aside your other reasons for admiring your choices just temporarily,

13:20.540 --> 13:24.360
and ask yourself about each type that you have put down.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.340
Is it about anything?

13:29.880 --> 13:37.220
Nothing could be better than the hope of our field, and to let every science fiction writer know, beginning right now,

13:37.220 --> 13:41.160
and from now on, there will be no escape from the play.

13:45.920 --> 13:51.280
Well that is just what that makes, to bring the fitting end to this evening.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.820
Now I'd better be to three thoughts for tonight.

13:55.720 --> 14:00.620
I've been given a piece of news, which I know would have caused given Jim an extra minute,

14:02.220 --> 14:05.940
and I mentioned earlier that I can just finish the work, so I can go back and finish,

14:06.360 --> 14:12.120
and I've just been told that the Bobbein library there aren't except for the gift of his manuscripts,

14:12.500 --> 14:17.840
and papers, and books, and the will be kept there, however, changed this archive.

14:19.660 --> 14:25.020
So I think that I might as well have an entertaining play of changed-dish materials,

14:25.020 --> 14:27.680
which I think might have been in the upstairs part of the restaurant,

14:28.300 --> 14:31.480
if you can look at that night, anytime you're passing,

14:32.360 --> 14:39.520
and finally, to the Latin I know, to say to the other half, everyone who's taken part in this program,

14:40.280 --> 14:45.500
and provided an evening which Jim might have enjoyed as much as we all have,

14:46.200 --> 14:52.280
and most importantly available, I know you've got me just hearing from the person who arranged this,

14:52.280 --> 14:56.120
everything you can go visit there. Two DPS, two DPS.

15:08.760 --> 15:12.260
Tell you the truth, good night, thank you all very much indeed for coming.
