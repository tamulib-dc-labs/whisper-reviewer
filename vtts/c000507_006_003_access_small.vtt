00:01.620 --> 00:04.700
Okay, I have a whole bank of tape recorders rolling here in the background.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.800
Okay, about how long do you think this is going to take us to do this? About curiosity, say?

00:10.520 --> 00:14.880
Oh, we'll rattle along for about 30, 45 minutes whenever you get tired.

00:14.980 --> 00:19.100
It's real, you know, if you need to stop, you need to quit, if we need to pick it up sometime later, that's fine.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.020
Just go ahead and say so.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.040
I just wanted to find out, you know, if I...

00:23.040 --> 00:26.760
If you want to take a swig out of the Jack Daniels bottle, just say, excuse me a second, you know.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.600
No problem.

00:30.380 --> 00:33.500
So let's get started with a lot of real mundane things here.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.900
Okay, we'll see what kind of answers I can give to them.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.140
We'll talk about...let's just start off with a real basic question that you can answer in as much detail as you would like.

00:43.220 --> 00:45.660
We'll ask you, what type of store is it that you own?

00:46.280 --> 00:54.760
Okay. The Fantastic World's bookstore, the store that I own, started off, you know, two and a half years ago,

00:54.760 --> 00:58.780
and we specialize in items of the Fantastic.

00:59.520 --> 01:07.740
We have comic books, science fiction books, fantasy role-playing games, video games, and science fiction movies on videotape,

01:08.180 --> 01:12.060
and all the other paraphernalia that you would expect in relation to those items.

01:12.680 --> 01:17.980
For example, lead miniatures for role-playing games or dice, bags to put comics in,

01:17.980 --> 01:21.640
boxes, posters, portfolios, movie posters.

01:22.340 --> 01:24.840
So just an assortment of things, you know, related.

01:25.240 --> 01:32.960
We go all the way from talking animals like Garfield to Superman to Doctor Who and to Felix the Cat.

01:33.820 --> 01:35.240
Just a wide variety of things.

01:36.660 --> 01:41.540
All...the only common element is that they're all science fiction fantasy concepts to some extent.

01:44.940 --> 01:45.860
That's your answer.

01:45.860 --> 01:47.900
Yeah, okay. I should have mentioned that.

01:48.060 --> 01:51.700
One thing we do is there'll be a pause after your answer.

01:51.940 --> 01:54.720
Makes it easier to...yes, I should realize these things myself.

01:55.020 --> 01:57.960
Yeah, and also, let me know that you are actually finished talking.

01:58.400 --> 01:58.560
Yes.

01:59.600 --> 02:04.980
Okay, let's back up a little bit, and why don't you tell us how you got started in collecting?

02:05.960 --> 02:11.840
The way I got started in collecting is actually the way I got started in reading.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.760
My paternal grandfather was a bus driver.

02:16.100 --> 02:22.660
He used to pick up the comic books that people left on the bus and bring them, you know, and then I would get them from him.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.700
So I learned how to read when I was about five years old by reading comic books that were left on buses.

02:28.200 --> 02:35.600
So everyone who rode on a bus through a bunch of Texas in 1959, 1958, 1960,

02:35.600 --> 02:42.100
you know, I'm in their debt for being able to read from an early age and from my love of comics and science fiction.

02:42.900 --> 02:49.140
And I went from that to keeping the comics that I had read and putting them on a little shelf in my closet.

02:49.620 --> 02:57.940
And from that point, it began to snowball where, you know, I began picking up anything that I felt was related to comics.

02:58.560 --> 03:04.320
And then I eventually got into science fiction reading when I met Fritz Leiber at a convention in 1968.

03:08.380 --> 03:14.740
Okay, Bob, why don't you go into a little bit more detail as to how that kind of got into your collecting sort of merged with your business?

03:17.720 --> 03:29.380
At one point, you know, I noticed that my personal taste in comic books, the ones that I felt were the superior examples of comic books as an art.

03:29.920 --> 03:36.380
And the ones that seem to be increasing in value on the collector's market had a lot in common.

03:36.380 --> 03:48.760
And I began to feel that there was the potential that if I picked up a couple of extra copies of the ones that I felt were really good comics that they would appreciate in value faster than just going and buying a handful at random.

03:50.140 --> 04:01.180
And so I began to speculate in collecting books by buying them in the hope that someone would come along later and want to pay me more money for them than I had paid for myself.

04:02.020 --> 04:16.640
And then I began to do the same thing with science fiction books, but on the smaller margin I began buying books from England, which were not generally available in this country in the late 70s, and taking them to conventions and selling those.

04:16.640 --> 04:33.880
And I kept sending aside more and more extra comics and more and more books, and I realized that I had to either buy myself a larger house to store all this stuff in, that I was only using a couple of times a year or going ahead and open a store for retailing.

04:34.240 --> 04:41.180
I chose to open a store because this has much more tax evan just to owning a house just to store books in.

04:45.040 --> 04:54.100
Okay, let's get into a little bit more specifically on the collecting. What do you concentrate on when you're collecting? Which particular type of item?

04:56.460 --> 05:00.580
Do you want in general for myself or do people generally concentrate on?

05:01.140 --> 05:04.120
Let's talk about yourself. When you're collecting, what do you concentrate on?

05:04.120 --> 05:13.960
At this time, my main collections, I'm collecting things by Philip Jose Farmer, Michael Moorcock, and Carl Nellison.

05:14.900 --> 05:26.920
And so I just concentrate essentially on finding things that I don't already have, and I work off of bibliographies and lists and try to find things in better condition than the ones I already have.

05:27.900 --> 05:44.560
So looking for hardcover books where they were published in small quantities and looking for paperback books that are published under pseudonyms or from small presses are the things that require the most attention for finding them at inexpensive prices.

05:45.320 --> 06:00.980
And the best way to do that is to be aware of what names the authors have written works under and what publishers their work has appeared from so that you can kind of train your mind to key off whenever you see that publisher's name or the title of the book, even if you don't remember the author.

06:03.580 --> 06:16.680
Okay, you're starting touching on another question I've got here. Let's get into it a little more specifically. And what makes a book, a hardback book, a valuable collector's type of collectible?

06:17.580 --> 06:29.500
Well, from the simplest standpoint, what makes a hardback book collectible to anyone is simply supply and demand, and that there are more people wanting the book than there are books available at cover price.

06:30.100 --> 06:45.080
Usually this doesn't take place, obviously, until after the book is out of print. Oftentimes, science fiction fans will see a hardcover book and they'll say, hmm, well, if I wait a year, I can buy that in paperback, and they'll pass the book up.

06:45.600 --> 06:54.280
And then when the book comes out in paperback, they read it and discover it's the greatest thing, because they put raisins and bread. So they go back and they want to buy a hardcover for a durable copy.

06:55.160 --> 07:03.080
However, at this time, the publisher has probably already either remainder the book or allowed the book to go out of print when all the copies were sold by the people who did buy a hardcover.

07:03.620 --> 07:13.420
And the supply of people out there looking for the book and demanding, I want a copy of book X and no books being available forces the price up on the collector's market.

07:14.620 --> 07:23.540
The other things that can cause the book to become valuable are usually errors in the same way that a stamp being printed upside down would cause a stamp to be valuable.

07:24.240 --> 07:40.200
If a publisher decides to accidentally destroy all the copies of a book so that only a few hundred exist, or if only a few copies are made with some variation that was corrected in another edition, this also can cause the book to be valuable.

07:40.980 --> 07:51.720
And then you also can have a situation where you create a book just to make a book valuable. That would be the case if you have a strictly limited edition where it's signed and numbered.

07:57.300 --> 08:10.400
Let's talk a little bit about those, the specialty edition type pressures and first editions. When a person is collecting, like myself, I collect signed first editions.

08:14.780 --> 08:28.040
What would you look for in a book to say, aside from the fact that you're collecting a specific author, let's say you're just looking at buying a book and you say, gee, I wonder if this is going to increase in value.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.940
Is there any sort of judgment you can use there?

08:30.480 --> 08:47.200
Well, the best judgment that you can use is to try to read as many reviews of recent hardcover books as you can. This is, you know, outside of, you know, going to the library and checking the books out and reading them in hardcover editions.

08:47.440 --> 08:55.420
If you happen to live in a city where the library still has a budget to be able to afford to buy such, you know, things as science fiction hardcover books.

08:56.740 --> 09:05.260
Reviews, the only thing that you can use to guide yourself with any certainty is to find someone that writes reviews that generally has the same type of taste that you have.

09:06.040 --> 09:19.740
There are some things which obviously you can be pretty sure of that a new Arthur C. Clark novel is going to be, you know, of interest to a number of people, even if it's no good, that, you know, people would still want,

09:19.740 --> 09:36.440
that merely because it's by Arthur C. Clark. The biggest problem is if someone happens to get a book published in hardcover and they do not have a name built up for themselves, that's a real gamble, you know, to spend $12, $15, $20 to find out if the book is worthwhile.

09:36.440 --> 10:01.480
And this is generally where books tend to springboard a lot. A good example of this is that the books by Julian May, the many colored land, and the golden torque has shown a great deal of increase in attention from book buyers in hardcover since they were, you know, nominated for awards in the science fiction community.

10:01.480 --> 10:13.060
And since the book club edition came out, bringing a cheap edition that a lot of people were able to read, after it was read by a lot of people, people were going, hey, you know, I like this book, where can I get the hardcover?

10:13.520 --> 10:24.640
And we've sold more copies of the hardcover of the many colored land in our store since the book club edition of this particular book came out than we did in the entire time that it had been released.

10:27.800 --> 10:38.500
Let's talk a little bit about the books from the standpoint of collectability as far as book club editions and standard publishing house editions.

10:39.140 --> 10:55.060
All right. For the most part, if you're buying a book club edition of a book, if it's already been published in hardcover by a publisher, and the book club edition is a reprint, the book club edition has no collectible value whatsoever.

10:56.140 --> 11:06.060
The only thing you're doing is you're buying a disposable book, which, you know, you're buying a paperback that has hardcovers, but it's not going to ever have any collectible value.

11:07.720 --> 11:12.200
In my opinion, in most people's opinion, they're in the rare book trade.

11:12.880 --> 11:26.460
The only way a book club edition might have a value would be if it's the first hardcover edition. An example of this would be if DAW Books brings out a novel by C.J. Chara and the book club brings out a hardcover edition of it.

11:26.720 --> 11:31.860
That would be the first hardcover edition of the book, so it would have a collectible value as a hardcover edition.

11:31.860 --> 11:47.020
But beyond that, beyond the times when the book club brings out the only hardcover edition of a paperback book, the book club editions, you know, just do not have any collectible value because they're not first printings and they're not true hardcover book editions.

11:49.360 --> 11:58.780
Okay. Limiting yourself to science fiction and fantasy as far as categories go, how much can a book cost from the various things you've seen over the years?

12:01.200 --> 12:02.600
How much can a book cost?

12:03.560 --> 12:04.840
Okay, let's look.

12:05.180 --> 12:10.140
What's the question down? Is it what you want to know? How much a book can go up in price?

12:10.740 --> 12:13.860
Yeah, yeah, and is it a hardcover used book, old book or what?

12:13.860 --> 12:27.840
Yeah, let's talk in respect to a used book or the highest price you've ever seen on a book going for sale and stuff like that.

12:28.700 --> 12:44.240
Well, the highest prices on hardcover books right now in the field tend to be in books that were published by specially publishers before there was mass distribution of hardcover fiction for science fiction and fantasy.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.820
Examples being especially like Arkham House books.

12:47.820 --> 12:58.840
The early books by H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard and hardcover from Arkham House go for a great amount of money even if they're in only so-so condition.

13:01.400 --> 13:10.660
That's a good example of a book being worth hundreds of dollars that cost less than ten dollars for the most part when they were first published.

13:14.500 --> 13:26.360
Yeah, okay, I know where there are several of the Arkham House first editions in immaculate shape. I can only get my hands on them.

13:28.560 --> 13:34.660
Well, I know there's some R2, but they have me in people's collections and they would take offense if I wouldn't put my hands on them.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.740
These are not in somebody's collection. These are in a library.

13:38.740 --> 13:55.120
A library. Of course, this is a ring of appointments you haven't asked, but a book having been in the library and stamped with library stamps and having had a card pocket attached to it and glued in does decrease the value of a book and make it less desirable to a collector.

13:55.960 --> 14:02.100
It's the same way that if you had a book that someone had taken a mark slot and scrolled across a couple of pages, it would be less desirable.

14:04.300 --> 14:12.080
Except like on an extremely rare book where library copies might be some of the only copies you could actually get a hold of.

14:12.200 --> 14:23.500
Well, they'd still be less desirable than a perfect copy, but if you had a choice between no copy and a copy that wasn't in perfect condition, obviously you would probably be inclined to go ahead and take a less than perfect copy.

14:26.140 --> 14:37.180
There are a few books in my collection that were from libraries that had had clearance sales, so to speak, where they go through and take the books out that have been circulating.

14:37.980 --> 14:45.780
I have a copy of Philip Jose Farmer's The Green Odyssey and a Ballantyne book's hardcover that had a convention in the summer.

14:45.780 --> 14:56.000
Philip Jose Farmer signed the book and told me that there were only a couple of hundred copies of that book that actually were distributed, that most of them ended up in military libraries.

14:56.600 --> 15:01.420
So it was rare to see one at all, but it was rare to see one that wasn't a library book.

15:03.420 --> 15:07.340
Any other sort of accidental finds that were kind of valuable?

15:08.380 --> 15:09.640
In my own collection?

15:11.520 --> 15:11.960
Yes.

15:12.980 --> 15:21.220
I've had a number of strokes of what I would have to consider luck as far as finding books that I consider to be quite valuable.

15:21.820 --> 15:38.020
I was at a book fair at one time with Lewis Shiner, a short story writer who's appeared in Omni and Shayol in various magazines, and we were just looking through tons and tons of hardcover books, miles and miles of historical romances.

15:39.060 --> 15:48.100
And we were giving up and over in a little bitty pile on the side, there was a little bitty book, a little bit was sticking out and looked familiar.

15:48.600 --> 16:02.060
It was a Nome Press book written by Henry Cutner and the name Lewis Padgett called Robots Have No Tales that was in perfect condition and they had priced it, but I thought it was the outrageous price of 40 cents.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.420
But I went on ahead and paid the 40 cents.

16:06.700 --> 16:15.960
That was a tough blow to pay that much money for a book worth just 100, 200 times more than that, but I was able to tear loose the money.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.420
It's a rough life.

16:19.700 --> 16:19.840
Yes.

16:24.360 --> 16:28.080
What part of your collection are you most proud of?

16:32.360 --> 16:44.740
I would have to say that there's not really any one item that I'm most proud of as far as being difficult to find.

16:46.420 --> 16:54.000
I do have a one of a kind item in my collection that I purchased at an auction this last summer.

16:54.780 --> 17:00.760
It's a translation from the French of the book, Philippe of the Farmer, conquers the universe.

17:02.820 --> 17:08.880
That Philippe of the Farmer donated to an auction at a convention that my store sponsored in Dallas during the summer.

17:09.740 --> 17:15.520
That has a cover letter and it's signed by Mothoposé Farmer and a copy of the book in French that was translated from.

17:16.000 --> 17:23.260
It's a translation that the publisher who has the option on this book, Berkeley Books, has decided that they did not want to publish in that form.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.140
So that will be the only version of that in English.

17:27.240 --> 17:34.980
So I suppose as far as the rarity, having the only copy floating around of that should be a novelty to some extent.

17:38.340 --> 17:53.120
Something along the same line, I know this is a pretty open-ended question, but what would you consider to be the ultimate item or items in collecting in the hardcover field, I guess?

17:54.180 --> 18:10.680
Well, among the ultimate items to find in the hardcover field are some of the double-day hardcover books of recent years that had very small printings and for one reason or another had very small distribution.

18:10.680 --> 18:17.180
To the come to mind are Roger Zalassny's Nine Princes in Amber and Philippe of the Farmer's Flesh.

18:19.500 --> 18:28.140
And I would be in the position of passing apocryphal, potentially, stories about why these books are in slow editions or small editions.

18:28.760 --> 18:38.960
But my understanding is that both of these books were re-majored very quickly upon publication and had very little distribution outside of review copies and library copies.

18:41.180 --> 18:56.520
So those books are both hard to find. I've only seen two copies of either of those books in the time that I've been collecting books and looking at hardcover since about 69.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.120
And I have one of them.

19:02.960 --> 19:03.900
Which one do you have, sir?

19:04.120 --> 19:04.960
Nine Princes in Amber.

19:05.040 --> 19:05.260
Okay.

19:06.280 --> 19:06.520
Yeah.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.700
Probably paid more than the cover price for the book.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.620
A few bucks more, yeah.

19:13.760 --> 19:18.820
Let's talk a little bit about the...what type of science fiction do you read for pleasure?

19:19.900 --> 19:22.100
What type of science fiction do I read for pleasure?

19:24.900 --> 19:34.120
I'd really prefer not to answer that, not to have that particular comment about not answering that included in the program.

19:34.460 --> 19:35.360
No problem, no problem.

19:35.360 --> 19:47.820
I can go off on the sidebar here and tell you, not for transmission, that right now I'm having a difficult time reading science fiction because I've been writing for so long that I've gotten to a saturation point.

19:48.260 --> 19:53.380
But I'd rather not try to explain that right now to a, you know, over the air type thing.

19:53.540 --> 19:58.160
No, no problem. In fact, I have the same problem myself. I haven't read anything in nearly a year.

19:59.100 --> 20:02.360
That's how come I edit the show and I produce it, but I don't actually...

20:03.180 --> 20:14.040
But, you know, I can...you know, I have read...you know, you can ask me what books I've read recently because I have started reading stuff again, but I'm not reading them for...you know, the only thing I've read for pleasure lately is Fever Dream by George Martin.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.060
I wouldn't consider that a science fiction book at all.

20:17.320 --> 20:24.680
Yeah, yeah. In fact, George's book is one of the first ones I'm going to pick up and read after Christmas. Let's get back to something else.

20:24.820 --> 20:25.160
Okay.

20:25.960 --> 20:34.820
Your customers, your customers, what are they most interested in in science fiction or fantasy or what do they seem to buy the most of?

20:35.860 --> 20:50.140
Well, right now, the types of things that are the most popular with my customers in mass, the ones that sell the most, are pretty much the same things that are reflected in most specialty stores in North America.

20:50.140 --> 21:03.040
If you check the Locust's best seller list and things, and it appears Anthony's Xanth books sell tremendously well, and the various books in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams sell well.

21:03.920 --> 21:09.680
And beyond that, we sell the Thieves World series by Robert Lynn Astor very well.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.780
I think a common thing in all three of these books is that these books are not serious completely. They don't...there's a bit of whimsy in all of them.

21:18.780 --> 21:27.400
I think it's safe to say that the bulk of my clientele prefers a little bit of humor and lightness mixed in with their reading.

21:28.340 --> 21:35.560
But we have strong backless sales in almost every aspect of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.

21:42.480 --> 21:49.820
Okay, let's see. Are you still actively collecting?

21:51.760 --> 22:05.560
I'm not collecting as actively as I was a few years ago. It's only because that running my own business like this has taken a lot more time than I would have dreamed it would when I began.

22:06.020 --> 22:13.540
So I don't really have the time to go to conventions and prowl through thousands of books looking for those one or two elusive items.

22:13.980 --> 22:20.900
I don't have time to go driving around the countryside, you know, prowling through every used bookstore that I happen to spy off the road.

22:21.280 --> 22:26.000
I don't even have the money to pay for the gas at the current gas prices to do that, even if I had the time.

22:27.400 --> 22:33.640
So my collecting is still coming strong. I do have one advantage that most people don't have.

22:34.100 --> 22:40.520
Whenever people decide to get rid of their collection, they bring it in and they say, you know, Bob, would you like to buy my collection?

22:41.180 --> 22:48.760
They come in with it and you look at what they've got and you make them an offer and they refuse and you make them another offer and they accept.

22:49.120 --> 22:54.500
I get to go through it first and pick out what I want for myself. And I make myself some really good deals.

22:56.640 --> 23:03.940
So I do have that advantage which kind of makes up for not being able to go out and look around for stuff as much as I used to.

23:06.440 --> 23:07.900
I envy you that.

23:12.420 --> 23:23.220
Sort of a collector's question. As far as the storage and preservation of books, what sort of things would you recommend that a collector do?

23:24.980 --> 23:28.980
Well, there are a number of, let's say, schools of thought on this.

23:30.920 --> 23:42.120
Obviously, the ultimate type of thing you could do would be to go with archival situations where you would have it so that the humidity and the temperature would all be controlled.

23:42.300 --> 23:45.280
You would keep everything out of direct sunlight so that you wouldn't have any fading.

23:46.100 --> 23:57.420
But the best thing you can do is make sure that your books are not going to be getting any direct sunlight to cause fading on the spines or fading on the pages.

23:57.720 --> 24:08.620
That you handle the books with care, that you don't eat food or take a bath while you read them, that you don't loan them out to people who drool.

24:09.480 --> 24:13.420
Just common sense things will extend the life of the books.

24:14.440 --> 24:24.240
Beyond that, we've found that the part of the book that usually gets damaged the easiest is the thin paper dust jacket around the book.

24:25.060 --> 24:37.120
And there are plastic slip covers that are available to put those into similar to what a library uses, but they don't have to be pasted down or stapled or taped down to the boards of the book.

24:37.120 --> 24:45.780
This protects the dust jacket and also makes it where if you're holding the book that you don't get fingerprints on the dust jacket or greasy marks on it.

24:47.300 --> 24:56.820
Beyond that, just keeping the books dusted, obviously you want to keep them away from termites or anything that happens to find paper as a real feast for food.

24:57.460 --> 25:03.440
You don't want a storm underneath a pipe that drips or where your air conditioner condensation is going to leak out.

25:03.440 --> 25:13.160
Just anything that you should stop and think about storing paper products, just anything that's going to cause paper damage you should try to avoid.

25:15.260 --> 25:20.020
Okay, what about a more perishable item like a comic book storage or something like that?

25:20.180 --> 25:30.440
Well, a comic book, if you're going to keep a comic book for a collection, it's important to handle it carefully.

25:31.660 --> 25:37.320
And if you're going to keep it, you should bag it up, at least in a plastic bag.

25:37.780 --> 25:56.760
If you have a comic book that's worth over $50-100, you might want to invest in bags of a type of plastic in which a lot of the things that would be in a plastic that would potentially cause the comic to deteriorate in 50 or 100 years would be neutralized.

25:56.760 --> 26:07.060
If you want to go further along, if you have comic books that are worth hundreds of dollars, there are things in the process of making pulp paper that will eventually cause it to rot.

26:07.160 --> 26:10.340
You can have this stuff de-acidified.

26:11.740 --> 26:15.520
But there's no point in doing this with just every comic book on the shelf.

26:15.940 --> 26:25.000
Actually, if you don't have any errors and you don't plan to be donating these to a library or something, comic books that they're handled properly are going to outlive you most likely.

26:25.940 --> 26:27.940
There's no real danger involved.

26:28.460 --> 26:39.900
They should be kept away from high humidity and excessive extremes of temperature and kept in a dry and cool place and kept out of direct sunlight.

26:42.440 --> 26:48.820
There are plenty of boxes that are available commercially to store comics in that can keep up to 300 of them.

26:48.820 --> 26:56.320
This is important because time is so easily damaged because they're so thin the paper is such a light weight stock.

26:57.200 --> 27:04.980
It's just a matter of just properly caring for them and keeping them from being bitten damaged.

27:07.980 --> 27:14.040
Okay, let's talk just a little bit more specifically on comics because I still collect a few.

27:19.940 --> 27:22.440
Hard to think how to word this one exactly.

27:23.120 --> 27:29.960
When I started collecting comics, I didn't collect them because I thought it was going to become something valuable on down the line.

27:31.220 --> 27:38.420
What about now if somebody was starting to collect comics? How would you recommend they go about it?

27:38.920 --> 27:48.020
Well, the first recommendation I make to people if they come in and say, I read that so-and-so comic book has gone up a thousand percent in two years.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.840
What comic book would you recommend that I should start collecting?

27:51.660 --> 27:58.340
I tell people that they really shouldn't be buying comics unless they enjoy reading comics.

27:58.920 --> 28:08.460
If there's nothing in that comic they enjoy reading, then they're making a mistake getting into comics because there are other things they could invest money in

28:09.160 --> 28:14.060
that the people will not laugh at you when you go to the bank and tell them that you want to use it for collateral.

28:14.860 --> 28:20.520
So if a comic book has an investment, it's the kind of thing that's really been overplayed in the media to some extent.

28:20.960 --> 28:25.020
I mean, it sounds real good for the few comics that have appreciated a great deal of value,

28:25.020 --> 28:30.780
but speaking from experience, a bank does not really think that that's the kind of collateral they want to hold for a loan.

28:31.760 --> 28:35.280
So stocks and bonds still sound preferable to me as investments.

28:38.500 --> 28:44.880
The biggest thing that's happened in comic books recently is probably the biggest thing that's happened since comic books began

28:45.480 --> 28:59.780
is that the ownership of some of the characters is now being held by the individual creators in much the same way that a publisher does not own a novel by Isaac Asimov.

28:59.860 --> 29:01.860
Isaac Asimov would own the copyright.

29:02.600 --> 29:09.140
And now comic books are coming out where the writer or the artist or both own the copyright to the character,

29:09.140 --> 29:15.420
and the publisher is publishing it for them in the same kind of relationship that a book publisher has with a novelist.

29:15.860 --> 29:24.520
And this is a complete change in the former system of the publisher owning everything, everything being done on a work-for-hire basis,

29:25.020 --> 29:31.220
as though the artist was just coming in and doing the same type of function as sweeping the floors inside the corporate offices.

29:32.020 --> 29:43.360
This is going to be a change that's going to become more and more evident in the next few years, and it's going to create a lot of more excitement within the comic book field.

29:46.260 --> 29:48.340
I wasn't aware that they had done that.

29:49.860 --> 29:54.040
Just from your own speculation, how do you think that might change the comics industry?

29:54.500 --> 29:58.780
Well, I have to go back a little bit.

29:58.780 --> 30:09.880
The other thing that has changed the comic industry is the change in distribution, where at one time all the comic books pretty much were available at 7-Eleven's and drug stores.

30:10.640 --> 30:16.720
And at 7-Eleven bought them from a distributor, the same people used to that had a TV guide, Time Magazine and such things.

30:17.460 --> 30:21.800
And they got a bundle of comic books in, and what they didn't sell, they sent back for credit.

30:23.260 --> 30:33.540
And this meant that the publishers had to print just like on anything else, had to print, you know, let's say 500,000 and they sold 200,000 and 300,000 got thrown away.

30:35.060 --> 30:43.660
With the rise of specialty shops that sell comic books and science fiction books, those shops order their comics in a different fashion.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.240
They order them non-returnable.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.720
They get a better discount, but they have to keep everything they order.

30:49.860 --> 30:56.000
And it's now to the point where a lot of comic titles are being published only in the non-returnable format.

30:56.540 --> 31:04.940
So if a person is only buying their comic books at a 7-Eleven or in a small town that doesn't have a specialty store, there are a number of titles they would never have seen.

31:05.340 --> 31:14.500
In fact, there are titles that are being published only for specialty store distribution that are selling better than some of the comic books that have distribution in both forms.

31:14.500 --> 31:23.840
Examples of this would be Camelot 3000 from DC Comics, which takes the King Arthur saga, brings it back to life, but in the year 3000.

31:24.520 --> 31:38.620
Star Slayer from Pacific Comics just moving to another company called First Comics, which takes a man from out of the past and springs him into the future, where he goes around and finds alien menaces and zooms from galaxy to galaxy.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.580
These titles are only published in specialty stores.

31:44.500 --> 31:54.960
And the thing with the book like Star Slayer, which is written and drawn by Mike Grell, who used to work for DC Comics doing The Warlord, is that Mike Grell owns the copyright to Star Slayer.

31:56.960 --> 32:14.600
And the fact that Mike Grell owns the copyright means that when his contract with the publisher Pacific Comics expired with issue number 6, he was able to find a better deal and make more money from himself and take it to First Comics, a new publishing company out of Chicago for starting with issue number 7.

32:16.120 --> 32:26.420
The idea that a person could move a character from one company to another for a better financial deal had never occurred any one a few years ago under the old system of publishing.

32:26.900 --> 32:36.260
But in the same way in book publishing, then not every novel by an author necessarily is going to come out from the same publisher. There's no reason for every issue of a comic book to come out from the same publisher.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.320
Yeah, that is very interesting.

32:46.080 --> 32:53.840
Let's see, we've covered most of the things I have here. Let's go to one for a good old educational question.

32:55.320 --> 33:01.480
What would you advise a person with this, we've covered quite a bit in comics.

33:01.480 --> 33:16.960
What about somebody who's just getting into science fiction or fantasy hardcover or paperback and they start asking you about, well, what about collecting, you know, what would you advise a beginning collector as far as selection or something like that?

33:18.780 --> 33:25.160
Well, first thing I would do, obviously a person is going to come in and say, I want to start collecting, has already read some stuff.

33:25.680 --> 33:32.180
So I would say to them, what have you read so far? It can be the name of some authors that you've enjoyed, some books that you've liked.

33:33.000 --> 33:42.020
I would springboard off of that, deporting out things that I would feel would be, you know, good collectible books within their field of interest.

33:42.960 --> 33:46.340
So that was how I would handle that particular situation.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.080
Okay, yeah.

33:52.160 --> 34:00.680
Give me like an example if you were to come in and say, you know, I'm so and so, I like this and this, you know, I could, but each of these kind of things I handle on an individual basis.

34:02.040 --> 34:08.980
Because you can't really tailor a response overall, you know, it just has to be geared for the individual customers wants and needs.

34:09.780 --> 34:12.060
Yeah, no, no, that's perfectly adequate answer Bob.

34:15.460 --> 34:16.320
Let's see.

34:20.620 --> 34:28.180
You might not want to answer this one in that somebody listening to this program may get in their car in California and drive and find your house and rip you off.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.460
How large is your collection?

34:37.920 --> 34:49.020
Well, I understand that it's not possible to drive from California to Texas without paying a real heavy toll somewhere between Abilene and Fort Worth, so that probably won't be a problem.

34:50.080 --> 34:59.260
My collection covers the walls of two rooms in my house.

34:59.320 --> 35:05.780
My house was built in about 1912 and has very, very high ceilings and the stuff goes from Florida's ceiling.

35:06.500 --> 35:11.220
I really don't have any idea how many books are my collection right now because it kind of fluxes.

35:11.220 --> 35:19.660
You know, occasionally I go through and I purge a few things out and I come back in and add, you know, twice as many as to what I purged down.

35:20.300 --> 35:26.520
But my hardcover books cover, you know, two of the walls, pay-or-back books from all the other walls.

35:28.920 --> 35:42.400
But I have, for example, complete collections of all of the fiction of Philpase Farmer, Michael Morkock, Harlan Ellison, and one former another.

35:42.720 --> 35:46.260
I don't have all the editions of their work, but I have all their books.

35:47.640 --> 36:06.860
The same way with the number of other authors, Robert Block, James Blish, and authors obviously that heavily used to handful the books in print that are younger authors have just started the business on a relative basis.

36:11.100 --> 36:16.560
Okay. That's about it. Got it covered, Bob. I think you did a very good interview.

36:18.320 --> 36:26.900
There's a lot of other things we could talk about, the art portfolios and other things which are collectible items.

36:26.900 --> 36:39.420
But I think we covered quite a bit as far as these shows are geared toward the print medium, comic books, paperbacks, and hardcover.

36:40.260 --> 36:40.700
Right.

36:41.040 --> 36:44.840
And this will probably be, you know John Marks, don't you?

36:56.760 --> 36:56.780
Yeah.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.020
I'm going to go ahead and kill the tape machines.

36:59.340 --> 36:59.560
Oh.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.860
Okay. Tape recorders are rolling again.

37:06.560 --> 37:14.480
If you would give me your address, the one that you use for your mail order, and if you also wish to include the phone number down there, just go ahead and do it.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.240
And this will be worked into the programs of course.

37:17.620 --> 37:18.020
Okay.

37:18.020 --> 37:22.580
Okay. That's Fantastic World's Bookstore.

37:24.820 --> 37:32.820
4816A is an Apple Camp Buoy Boulevard. Fort Worth, Texas. 7-6107.

37:33.440 --> 37:39.520
And our phone number is 817-731-6222.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.320
Call now. Operators are standing by.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.880
It slices it, dices it. Okay.
