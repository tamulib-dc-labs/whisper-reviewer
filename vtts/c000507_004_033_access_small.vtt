00:01.760 --> 00:04.420
Yeah, let's do a little check to make sure things don't work.

00:05.800 --> 00:06.620
Technical wonders.

00:07.500 --> 00:07.760
Hello.

00:09.220 --> 00:10.020
Testing, one, two, three.

00:10.580 --> 00:10.800
Okay.

00:11.760 --> 00:12.400
We are there.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.800
We had finished something, hadn't we?

00:13.920 --> 00:15.800
We had just finished your question.

00:16.520 --> 00:17.340
And his answer.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.320
You're going to say something?

00:22.600 --> 00:23.820
No, I'm expecting over there for something.

00:24.040 --> 00:24.640
Go ahead.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.880
I had one more question.

00:28.880 --> 00:34.580
On one of your novels, the veils of Azlarok, as it's pronounced?

00:35.400 --> 00:36.080
I guess so.

00:38.280 --> 00:43.340
As a reader, I would probably have to say that would be your most hard science book.

00:44.120 --> 00:53.980
Well, I guess I wouldn't really think of it that way because these veils are so totally

00:53.980 --> 01:02.280
lacking in any real scientific basis that I don't think most scientists would think

01:02.280 --> 01:05.180
was anything to do with hard science, actually.

01:05.460 --> 01:07.660
Well, the mechanism used to explain it.

01:07.700 --> 01:08.040
What was it?

01:08.320 --> 01:09.740
There was a pulsar in a black hole.

01:09.780 --> 01:09.940
Yeah.

01:10.060 --> 01:12.400
And what was the third, the Azlarok itself?

01:12.760 --> 01:20.820
Well, the third body in this mutual orbit was Azlarok itself, which is not really a planet,

01:20.820 --> 01:32.920
but a place partly habitable because there were layers of gravity reversal or something

01:32.920 --> 01:33.260
or other.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.980
Anyway, it was like a vast world.

01:37.580 --> 01:39.800
There was lots of space for people to live.

01:42.440 --> 01:49.640
The air was good and the temperature was good and everything else was totally weird.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.240
Were you convinced in me?

01:52.460 --> 01:55.880
The veils and the setup there sounded to me like you were...

01:56.500 --> 02:02.020
Well, one thing I like, I got to have people walking around on the surface of a pulsar,

02:02.200 --> 02:03.880
which was a lot of fun.

02:06.980 --> 02:11.240
When you deal with something that's as hard science as that, do you worry about the research

02:11.240 --> 02:13.900
and being scientifically accurate part of it?

02:13.960 --> 02:18.920
No, because if I was going to be scientifically accurate, there's no way I'd get them walking

02:18.920 --> 02:23.580
around on the surface of the pulsar or going through the black hole and popping out again.

02:23.940 --> 02:30.780
I want it to sound as if it's scientifically accurate, but actually what I'm doing is writing

02:30.780 --> 02:38.460
fiction and if the science helps it work as fiction, fine.

02:38.740 --> 02:43.880
It's certainly nobody's going to take it as a scientific theory of any kind, I hope.

02:44.940 --> 02:52.480
In other words, you see yourself more as an entertainer, more than somebody with...

02:52.480 --> 02:57.340
For instance, some science fiction writers that we've talked to or interviewed sort of

02:57.340 --> 03:00.560
see themselves as having a mission, either bringing science fiction into the mainstream

03:00.560 --> 03:05.920
of literature or educating people in the intricacies of science or something, but that wouldn't

03:05.920 --> 03:08.520
be your concern simply to tell a story would be your...

03:08.520 --> 03:09.860
My concern is to tell a story.

03:10.120 --> 03:21.500
I think if I interest people in science indirectly, then maybe I've achieved some good for the

03:23.480 --> 03:33.920
future of our scientific progress, but I'm not a trained scientist and I'm not really out

03:33.920 --> 03:35.320
to sell science.

03:41.960 --> 03:48.180
In the years you've been in the field, it seems to me that there's been a tremendous boom

03:48.180 --> 03:51.660
in readers and popularity of science fiction.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.600
What would you attribute this to?

03:54.720 --> 03:56.480
Simply a larger reading public, more authors?

03:56.480 --> 04:05.300
A larger public and probably a better educated public.

04:10.780 --> 04:14.200
I don't know what else you could say.

04:15.200 --> 04:21.340
When you're writing, since you've written both in fantasy and in science fiction, do

04:21.340 --> 04:23.380
you find one easier to work with than the other?

04:23.940 --> 04:27.860
I like to change back and forth.

04:28.140 --> 04:36.240
I get a little tired of doing whatever it is I'm doing after a long book and then I

04:36.240 --> 04:40.760
like to do something as different as I can find from that.

04:44.040 --> 04:50.340
How do you react to the so-called new wave that has hit and possibly passed now?

04:51.100 --> 04:53.780
Do you consider yourself in any way connected with that?

04:54.240 --> 04:58.280
No, I don't have any special feelings about it one way or the other.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.080
I don't think you'd call it the new wave any longer, whatever it was.

05:03.660 --> 05:08.020
Some years ago, I think people were talking about this.

05:11.280 --> 05:19.980
Would you say that science fiction is so different from other, say, mainstream?

05:19.980 --> 05:21.520
I keep using the term mainstream literature.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.480
That it is a separate thing and should be kept there.

05:26.300 --> 05:30.780
That certain qualities, for instance, the characters of science fiction, the emphasis

05:30.780 --> 05:35.360
on ideas, it's a different kind of literature that should be kept separate.

05:35.540 --> 05:36.720
No, I don't think so.

05:38.500 --> 05:44.220
Until just the last, what would you say, 100 years or maybe less?

05:44.960 --> 05:51.800
There was no division of literature that I know about into mainstream and other things.

05:52.600 --> 05:59.500
It's this division that seems to me a temporary change that should probably be abolished.

06:00.740 --> 06:06.060
Nobody, I mean Shakespeare uses ghosts freely.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.660
There's no, nobody thought anything of it.

06:11.560 --> 06:18.760
It seems at times that possibly the separation of different types of literature is perpetuated

06:18.760 --> 06:20.460
by the publishers more than anybody else.

06:20.960 --> 06:26.280
Well, I think you have the rack of thrilling romances and the rack of westerns and the rack

06:26.280 --> 06:27.360
of science fiction.

06:30.760 --> 06:36.860
But when the really popular books come along, they go over in the rack, it says best sellers.

06:36.860 --> 06:44.960
You know, they could be, yeah, I think it's probably the publishers who tend to, this

06:44.960 --> 06:48.080
is a western, it has to have this, it should be about this long and it should have this

06:48.080 --> 06:49.120
kind of a cover on it.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.440
And we'll classify it this way and then we send it out.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.040
So what's science fiction?

06:56.400 --> 07:00.800
What about some, do you have any contemporary science fiction authors that you particularly

07:00.800 --> 07:02.420
admire or like to read for enjoyment?

07:03.420 --> 07:05.240
Oh, there's a lot of them I admire.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.620
Actually reading science fiction, I don't do as much of that as I used to.

07:11.080 --> 07:17.240
I guess I just don't have time and there's a lot of other interesting things, history

07:17.240 --> 07:18.340
and so on I like to read.

07:22.100 --> 07:27.340
I don't really think I want to start naming authors because there are many good ones around.

07:28.980 --> 07:31.820
Do you have anything that you're working on currently?

07:33.240 --> 07:43.100
Yeah, I'm working on a collaboration with Roger Zalazny and I just finished a book called

07:43.100 --> 07:52.820
Octagon I mentioned earlier and I hope soon to be putting together an anthology of stories

07:52.820 --> 07:56.540
having to do with science fiction and chess, board games.

08:01.660 --> 08:07.340
And that's what I'm working on right now, there are other ideas waiting in the wings.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.600
What about movies? Have you had any movie rights taken up in any of your books?

08:14.720 --> 08:21.580
No, I had Nibbles a couple of times and once we got very close and then the man who was

08:21.580 --> 08:26.040
going to buy it had to use his money for a lawsuit or something or other I think.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.900
But so far no.

08:31.140 --> 08:35.700
Would it be fair to ask you what of your works do you consider to be your favorites?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.940
I'd probably give you a different answer on different days.

08:41.860 --> 08:48.180
I don't know, they all look very good when I start them and some of them even look very good

08:48.180 --> 08:57.120
when I finish them and I don't think I can step aside that much and really compare them

08:57.120 --> 09:01.400
with other people's books or even compare them among themselves.

09:04.360 --> 09:09.460
I only had one more question. Do you keep up with science fiction movies or science fiction

09:09.460 --> 09:13.660
in other media? Do you have any particularly favorite movies or any comments on how Hollywood

09:13.660 --> 09:14.680
handled science fiction?

09:15.320 --> 09:18.920
I thought 2001 was very good going back a few years.

09:20.420 --> 09:24.440
I didn't like Star Wars at all, I guess I was one of the few people in the world who was just

09:25.300 --> 09:26.800
completely turned off by then.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.760
Nothing else springs to mind immediately.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.220
Okay, that's about all I would have.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.220
Anything else to add?

09:44.320 --> 09:46.200
Anything you want to add to get on the tape?

09:47.380 --> 09:48.760
Anything you want to say for a pop star?

09:49.400 --> 09:51.460
I'll vote for all the people in the Fermi and Basin.
