00:02.060 --> 00:03.820
Let me get things pranked up here.

00:03.860 --> 00:05.860
Yeah, what do you want to tell me? What you gonna ask me?

00:07.140 --> 00:08.740
That makes no difference though.

00:13.940 --> 00:17.480
Basically, how long have you been living in your cross planes?

00:18.160 --> 00:22.200
I've been living in cross planes. I've lived here since 1922.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.000
That would be about...

00:25.200 --> 00:26.820
good for that to be far, isn't it?

00:26.820 --> 00:27.320
Yeah.

00:29.120 --> 00:34.040
I was a boy here and went to college and came back.

00:34.500 --> 00:38.000
Took over the newspaper, got out of college one day and took over the newspaper here the next one.

00:38.540 --> 00:42.420
Been here all the while. I retired from the newspaper about...

00:42.420 --> 00:43.620
oh, eight or nine years ago.

00:44.420 --> 00:51.020
When did I first meet him? Well, as a boy, I knew him here.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.840
When he was a boy,

00:53.840 --> 00:57.280
my heart would be about four or five years old.

00:57.380 --> 01:02.600
I guess he'd be about... I'm seventy years old.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.260
My heart would be about seventy four or five now, I think.

01:08.220 --> 01:10.280
I could check that out for you,

01:10.340 --> 01:12.660
but possibly you got that information at hand.

01:14.020 --> 01:16.000
When did you...

01:16.000 --> 01:18.920
I knew him at...

01:19.780 --> 01:21.980
I started to high school.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.860
I came in here, moved here from a nearby town

01:26.860 --> 01:30.420
and entered high school as about a sophomore.

01:31.820 --> 01:35.380
And in those days, we only had ten grades here

01:35.380 --> 01:38.980
and they were not affiliated. And Howard went down to Brown

01:38.980 --> 01:42.980
to finish his high school work in order to be qualified

01:42.980 --> 01:44.240
in order to enter college.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.620
When you came back to

01:49.620 --> 01:52.480
Cross Plains after going to college

01:52.480 --> 01:54.900
and you started over the newspaper...

01:54.900 --> 02:01.400
That was in July. I took over the newspaper in July 1930. Howard was here at the time.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.100
He was a young man, some...

02:04.100 --> 02:07.600
I was twenty years old and Howard must have been twenty-four or five.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.420
He was writing for a bunch of

02:12.420 --> 02:14.620
pulp magazines just getting started.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.160
Very few people remember the names of those magazines, but it was

02:20.160 --> 02:24.340
Stone Street and Smith. They published a number of magazines,

02:24.560 --> 02:25.660
like Weird Tales.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.120
Weird Tales was one of them, I believe, and

02:32.180 --> 02:36.240
Boxing and The West, The Wild West, and a lot of stuff like that.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.440
He mainly wrote for Weird Tales, but he also

02:39.920 --> 02:43.280
occasionally wrote for...he's either a ring or something.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.020
He occasionally wrote for Boxing magazine, too.

02:46.440 --> 02:51.360
Yeah, we were talking to Ms. Laughlin. She said sometimes he would go down the streets there,

02:51.500 --> 02:55.360
shadow boxing, sort of doing

02:55.360 --> 02:58.820
little... Yeah, I imagine that's more or less exaggerated. Howard

02:58.820 --> 03:03.060
was a little on the odd side.

03:03.140 --> 03:07.460
He wasn't an animal with very many people. He was rather a loof. But he was a big

03:07.460 --> 03:11.520
robust man. To me, he was a combination of

03:11.520 --> 03:15.540
Edgar Allen Poe and Jack London, if you can imagine that

03:15.540 --> 03:19.280
two together. Yeah, he had those books in his library,

03:19.400 --> 03:22.900
so I can imagine that pretty well. He was very robust,

03:23.580 --> 03:26.460
like Jack London. He was

03:28.120 --> 03:32.840
a majestine. A majestine. A majestine like Poe,

03:32.840 --> 03:35.300
and once he wrote a few poems, maybe

03:35.300 --> 03:38.480
you're familiar with the one called The Temptress.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.940
The Temptor. He wrote a very good...

03:42.940 --> 03:46.700
It reminds you of Poe's Raven, something, the meter of it, something like that.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.220
In that he compares the Temptor as a beautiful

03:52.680 --> 03:55.140
maiden who lures him. Her name

03:55.140 --> 03:58.900
is Suicide. Yeah, I do believe I have read that one.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.140
Yeah, I'm sure you've read it. We're very many people

04:03.140 --> 04:06.280
in cross planes aware that Howard was a writer or a writer, I guess.

04:06.280 --> 04:10.540
Oh, they all knew it. I published in the newspaper, you know, there wasn't a lot.

04:10.700 --> 04:14.740
I'd say Robert Howard had a story this week and weird tales

04:16.180 --> 04:18.920
or some of those problem magazines. Yeah, they knew it.

04:19.320 --> 04:23.200
Yeah, yeah, I take it being a small town, I guess, just about everybody knew everything else.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.980
Oh, yeah, that's right. And his daddy was a doctor here,

04:27.260 --> 04:30.840
a country doctor, general practitioner, well thought of, very popular

04:33.720 --> 04:34.240
and

04:34.240 --> 04:38.440
his father was proud of the fact that his son was a gifted writer.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.640
He talked about it.

04:42.840 --> 04:43.360
Yeah.

04:47.260 --> 04:51.060
Well, let's see. I'm about to run through my gambit of questions here.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.860
Is there anything in particular stories you know about Mr. Howard being

04:54.860 --> 04:59.000
that you were a newspaper man and everything? He might have had

04:59.000 --> 05:02.740
some exploits out there. I remember

05:02.740 --> 05:06.200
the morning he killed himself very well.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.060
It was,

05:11.980 --> 05:13.900
I can't think just when it was,

05:14.200 --> 05:18.700
I know it was a warm season of the year, it must have been summer. But anyway,

05:19.980 --> 05:22.080
early in the summer, 10, 11 o'clock morning

05:23.820 --> 05:27.000
I heard on the street that Robert Howard had just shot himself

05:27.000 --> 05:30.900
when I immediately jumped in my car and ran down there

05:30.900 --> 05:34.520
and got down there and a few neighbors had gathered.

05:35.420 --> 05:38.840
It wasn't generally known over town, but the old

05:38.840 --> 05:41.280
justice of the peace was standing there on the

05:43.320 --> 05:46.920
gallery, the front porch. When I walked up he called me and said,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.460
come here Jack. And I stepped up there and he took me into the bedroom

05:51.220 --> 05:54.960
and he pointed to an old Underwood type writer

05:54.960 --> 05:58.900
who had the four lines written on it there. And Howard

05:58.900 --> 06:02.960
had, when he had been told that his mother wouldn't

06:04.500 --> 06:06.020
live throughout the day,

06:07.040 --> 06:10.260
he went to this top writer, wrote these four lines, walked outside,

06:10.940 --> 06:14.940
sat down his car and shot his head off. And this old J.P. asked me

06:14.940 --> 06:19.080
what these four lines meant. They said, I'm sure

06:19.080 --> 06:23.020
you've read them all, flat all done, so let me on the power. The feast

06:23.020 --> 06:24.780
is over, the lambs expire.

06:27.460 --> 06:30.120
Yeah, we have read that. I'm sure you've read that.

06:30.480 --> 06:35.100
To me, I've been told since then by Sprague de Kemp

06:35.740 --> 06:38.420
that the lines are not entirely original.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.880
But they were certainly original as far as I'd ever heard, or anybody else had ever talked to

06:42.880 --> 06:46.840
except Sprague de Kemp. Yeah, I imagine that's

06:48.020 --> 06:50.620
was Howard's way of putting it.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.820
Yeah, that was his melodic reen.

06:54.420 --> 06:55.100
His finale.

06:57.860 --> 07:00.920
Well, Mr. Scott, I can't think of anything else. Can you think of any other

07:01.900 --> 07:05.840
bold thing? I'll tell you, you've got a son of Aaron Odessa. I'll tell you a young man there,

07:05.900 --> 07:08.460
an Odessa, you can pick up on the telephone and call him and know him.

07:09.620 --> 07:13.200
His name is J. Brown, B-A-U-M.

07:14.580 --> 07:17.740
He's a man he's 70 years old, he's just my age, but

07:19.440 --> 07:21.660
as a boy, he knew Robert Howard.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.040
His name is J. Baum. J. Brown.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.240
B-R-O-D-N-E Brown.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.200
B-A-U-M. His son is a

07:34.220 --> 07:36.280
loan officer and one of the

07:40.300 --> 07:42.620
loan associations out there. I don't know which one.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.340
Yeah, I'll see if I can track him down too.

07:48.140 --> 07:49.260
Well, we

07:49.260 --> 07:53.820
talked with Charlotte Laughlin and some other people in Brownwood who were doing

07:53.820 --> 07:58.560
some research on Howard. Have you talked to CFB

07:58.560 --> 08:02.080
or? No, sir, we talked to Jack Scott.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.760
Yeah, I know Jack. They're in cross planes and he referred

08:05.760 --> 08:07.560
us to you and your brother.

08:09.860 --> 08:13.280
And what we're mainly just looking for are just some

08:15.040 --> 08:17.180
old, some interesting stories

08:17.180 --> 08:19.600
or any reminiscences you might have about Mr. Howard.

08:21.120 --> 08:24.440
Well, yes, I'd be glad to tell you what I know about him.

08:24.660 --> 08:28.560
I try to think of some things that happened.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.960
He was a

08:32.960 --> 08:37.100
unusual fella. I know that. Have you read

08:37.100 --> 08:40.000
some of his stories? Yes, I have. What type of person was he?

08:40.640 --> 08:42.520
Well, he was kind of a loner.

08:46.640 --> 08:47.860
And I'll just

08:47.860 --> 08:51.460
recount on it. I don't think he ever went for the girl at all.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.680
But he wrote some pretty outstanding

08:57.240 --> 08:57.740
stories.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.460
Well, as I say

09:04.460 --> 09:06.080
in the, I recall

09:07.920 --> 09:09.980
some of the stories he wrote when he was

09:09.980 --> 09:13.760
in high school. And they were really

09:13.760 --> 09:16.780
outstanding. But he never did.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.200
He really wasn't in our group. He was kind of a

09:21.760 --> 09:25.940
outsider. Yes, he was readily accepted. But I remember one time

09:27.580 --> 09:29.720
we were having a party and

09:30.600 --> 09:34.180
I was running a little rental store there in cross planes

09:34.180 --> 09:37.180
and we were having a party upstairs.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.520
Robert came and we were

09:42.540 --> 09:45.420
drinking some beer, choc beer or something

09:46.180 --> 09:48.160
as way back before prohibition.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.400
And I know he got very upset about

09:54.400 --> 09:57.040
that he got a little bit tired and

09:58.240 --> 10:02.120
he said that he'd kill anybody that interfered with his

10:02.960 --> 10:05.280
hands. If his hands ever got

10:06.200 --> 10:09.720
damaged by somebody else, he'd kill him.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.580
Hello? Yes, sir.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.760
And that was just kind of, it kind of

10:17.760 --> 10:19.260
probably was kind of morose.

10:21.660 --> 10:25.160
And he thought he had a real bright future and he had a

10:25.860 --> 10:26.420
writer.

10:29.780 --> 10:32.400
And I don't think I ever saw him after that

10:32.400 --> 10:35.980
until I heard he had committed suicide, didn't he? Yes, he did.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.620
In 1936. I knew his father

10:40.620 --> 10:44.880
real well. I didn't know his mother much. I know he was an only child, I believe.

10:48.060 --> 10:48.500
And

10:50.780 --> 10:51.820
he never did

10:53.120 --> 10:55.920
enter into any of our activities

10:55.920 --> 10:59.080
very much as I remember. So I don't really know

10:59.080 --> 11:01.940
what I could just say to you that would help you.

11:03.400 --> 11:07.380
Well, what you've already told us is quite a bit of help. Why do you suppose he was such a loner?

11:07.520 --> 11:11.660
Being in a small town and usually everybody, you know, does things so much

11:11.660 --> 11:14.340
together. I don't know. I don't know. He just

11:15.640 --> 11:18.180
he could have been a great author, I think.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.220
He had a, I don't remember

11:22.220 --> 11:25.600
even what kind of grades he made at the

11:25.600 --> 11:28.280
academic. I know I

11:31.160 --> 11:32.120
took a

11:32.120 --> 11:37.360
idea, he had a story and tried to write a theme on it and he had already turned it

11:37.360 --> 11:41.040
and I got in big trouble as you know,

11:41.940 --> 11:43.440
trying to steal his ideas.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.220
And that kind of

11:47.220 --> 11:51.700
I never did try that anymore again, but I know he could tell a story

11:51.700 --> 11:55.440
that was really, this was something about

11:55.440 --> 11:59.520
a bear who got up in the attic or something

11:59.520 --> 12:03.700
and broke through and disturbed some poker players.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.480
But then I really can't

12:07.480 --> 12:10.580
tell you very much about Robert. I'm kind of thinking of it.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.680
There's another writer, C.F. Boz. I don't know if he ever heard

12:14.680 --> 12:17.900
of him or not. No, sir?

12:18.180 --> 12:20.760
Out of town, Jack didn't mention C.F.

12:21.500 --> 12:26.360
No, I don't believe so, no. Well, why did Jack tell you about him?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.480
Mostly he had worked

12:30.480 --> 12:33.040
a little bit for Jack on the newspaper and

12:34.820 --> 12:37.800
Jack talked about what type of person he was.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.920
He was a rigorous man although he kept to himself quite a bit.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.680
I wish Jack could recall more about that party, but

12:45.680 --> 12:48.200
I know he scared the hell out of all of us because he

12:49.960 --> 12:52.860
got really excited and always trying to

12:52.860 --> 12:57.320
damage his writing career or something, getting him full of beer.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.880
I don't recall exactly what, but anyway

13:04.200 --> 13:06.020
he said he'd kill anybody

13:06.020 --> 13:09.960
that damaged

13:09.960 --> 13:13.920
his hands anyway. I think I remember that pretty vividly.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.760
I don't know, maybe something happened there with his hands.

13:17.940 --> 13:22.260
Maybe we got it, uh, racking the match or something.

13:22.420 --> 13:25.300
I don't know. But anyway, he

13:26.060 --> 13:27.680
wanted to write for his hands.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.680
That was very interesting.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.760
You don't happen to write like any other things that you might have done

13:37.760 --> 13:41.760
with Howard back when we were living in Cross. Well, I could say he wasn't in our group.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.400
We went fishing and we went swimming in the

13:45.400 --> 13:49.680
bow there and we hunted quail and but

13:49.680 --> 13:53.480
he was never one of us. And now he happened

13:53.480 --> 13:57.580
to be in this deal. I don't know, I don't think he ever had

13:57.580 --> 14:01.080
the date with a girl. He was a nice looking guy.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.960
Very presentable and tall and

14:05.660 --> 14:06.520
well made.

14:09.060 --> 14:11.620
And even if I talk to you, I can't

14:13.820 --> 14:17.080
really tell you anything much that I remember about him except that

14:17.080 --> 14:20.620
I remember him being a very outstanding, that he would have been a great

14:20.620 --> 14:24.680
writer I think. Listen, what you've told me so far has

14:24.680 --> 14:29.080
been quite helpful. We're putting together just bits and pieces of

14:29.080 --> 14:33.160
people who did know him along with some research that some other people have done

14:37.020 --> 14:39.160
and I'd like to go ahead and put your

14:40.160 --> 14:42.940
recollections of that party and some of the other things you said into our program.

14:45.620 --> 14:46.580
Well, that's

14:46.580 --> 14:49.480
authentic but I can't quite recall the details

14:49.480 --> 14:52.900
of what happened to his hands. Maybe we were

14:54.360 --> 14:56.000
armwrestling or something. I don't know.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.560
But he got very uptight

15:01.780 --> 15:03.420
about what might happen to

15:04.660 --> 15:06.780
one of his hands or his arms or something.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.900
I guess that was the only time he ever had a drink of beer

15:11.900 --> 15:16.180
in his life. It sounded like what I was going to talk about with some of the other people

15:16.180 --> 15:18.700
that he might have been insecure.

15:19.940 --> 15:23.940
Well, I think so. He was an only child. I don't know how

15:23.940 --> 15:28.200
close he was with his mother but I don't think his father had anything to do with

15:28.200 --> 15:31.780
him. This was my kind of

15:31.780 --> 15:32.740
feeling, I don't know.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.640
Dr. Howard was a real fine man though.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.440
I don't know how close they were together but

15:43.440 --> 15:47.340
I think that he worshipped his mother

15:47.920 --> 15:50.000
was my impression in those years.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.800
I don't know if she died first or not.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.940
She had gone into a coma

15:58.940 --> 16:01.800
and was not expected to recover.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.820
Oh, well now that's the reason for his suicide.

16:05.520 --> 16:08.680
Because he worshipped her. I know

16:08.680 --> 16:12.500
I'm almost sure of that.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.620
But he worshipped his mother.

16:18.420 --> 16:19.580
I know that her

16:19.580 --> 16:22.820
condition affected him very much.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.420
I know that he was

16:26.420 --> 16:30.680
real afraid that something wasn't happening that he

16:30.680 --> 16:34.360
couldn't write it. Whether it was mind

16:34.360 --> 16:38.780
or whether it was his mind or whether it was in his fear that something

16:38.780 --> 16:42.440
would happen to his hands. But that seems to

16:42.440 --> 16:44.940
be the reason I recall more vivid than anything else.

16:45.060 --> 16:49.700
I certainly do appreciate your talking with me.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.280
And I believe I was the one that

16:53.960 --> 16:57.420
I believe that he could have strangled me to death.

16:58.220 --> 17:02.060
I don't recall whether it was me or somebody else

17:02.060 --> 17:05.220
but it seems to me like his anger was

17:05.220 --> 17:06.020
toward me.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.080
But I know he's writing the hell out of it.

17:12.820 --> 17:15.800
He was a very big and strong fellow.

17:16.020 --> 17:19.740
Yes, very strong. Could have twisted your neck off.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.360
Much like the heroes that he wrote about.

17:28.360 --> 17:30.580
If you would give me your address

17:30.580 --> 17:33.160
I'll send you a release form. What that does is

17:33.160 --> 17:35.640
you give us permission to use what I've been taping.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.440
Oh well, that doesn't matter to me. I don't care if I use it or not.

17:38.720 --> 17:42.040
I'm just trying to be honest with you. I have no

17:43.760 --> 17:46.240
hold on. You can quote me anyway you want to.

17:46.540 --> 17:51.580
As I say, it's been a long time ago but those are my recollections and I've often

17:51.580 --> 17:55.780
thought up. I've made a real strong impression

17:55.780 --> 17:59.440
on these that I was in real danger there.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.240
Fortunately you made it through it.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.220
I know that other things have happened to me that

18:06.220 --> 18:10.120
I guess almost is dangerous but then anyway that's

18:10.120 --> 18:13.280
what I remember about Robert.

18:14.680 --> 18:17.020
He was all at with

18:18.000 --> 18:20.040
no problems apparently.

18:24.180 --> 18:27.400
No attachments that I know of to anybody except

18:27.400 --> 18:30.320
for the people who were there.

18:30.320 --> 18:30.700
Thank you.
