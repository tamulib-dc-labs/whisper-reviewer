00:10.040 --> 00:14.240
Okay, Mr. Jacob, you've written both science fiction and fantasy.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.440
Which do you prefer to write?

00:18.280 --> 00:22.660
One thing I should mention, you addressed me as Mr. Jacob, I have nothing published under

00:22.660 --> 00:23.060
that name.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.240
It's all, here's Anthony.

00:25.640 --> 00:30.380
So if you're reproducing this, you should refer to it as Anthony or people will not

00:30.380 --> 00:31.480
know who you're talking about.

00:31.960 --> 00:36.040
Okay, it's much easier, it's hard to remember the Jacob quite frankly.

00:37.000 --> 00:37.400
Okay.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.960
Okay, you're asking which I prefer, science fiction and fantasy.

00:42.640 --> 00:49.120
And I have to give a complicated answer to that because it has different facets.

00:50.140 --> 00:56.280
For the challenge, for the sheer joy of getting in and tackling a difficult problem and surmounting

00:56.280 --> 00:58.640
it, science fiction is better.

01:00.420 --> 01:04.400
But if I need money, it's fantasy.

01:05.140 --> 01:08.040
I make my money on fantasy and it's very easy to do.

01:08.660 --> 01:12.520
So that it depends on what I really want.

01:12.620 --> 01:18.000
If I want to do something that I will feel will live after me and really be worth my

01:18.000 --> 01:19.980
effort, then it is science fiction.

01:21.200 --> 01:25.960
But right now I would say about three quarters of my money is being made in a fantasy.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.840
So that it is a certain pleasure to be able to do something like that and just be richly

01:30.840 --> 01:31.820
rewarded for it.

01:32.200 --> 01:38.200
Not so much intellectually, but I can't just ignore the financial aspect.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.000
It's nice to be paid well as well.

01:41.080 --> 01:45.640
For a number of years I was just scraping along on science fiction, doing what I wanted

01:45.640 --> 01:49.040
to, but not doing well financially.

01:49.740 --> 01:56.500
So that may not be precisely the answer you want, but there is this very sharp division

01:56.500 --> 01:57.120
between them.

01:58.220 --> 02:01.680
Actually I do enjoy each when I get into it.

02:02.840 --> 02:11.560
Whatever a genre or whatever project I get into, I do the very best I can and generally

02:11.560 --> 02:17.000
satisfy that I've done the best that I can in that particular genre.

02:17.820 --> 02:24.020
There are different thrusts, in all this discussion, have I managed to answer?

02:25.420 --> 02:26.820
That's exactly what I wanted.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.380
Mainly it's commercial, I gather, that there's just an economic reason for doing it.

02:34.220 --> 02:34.700
Economic?

02:34.980 --> 02:36.720
It's fantasy, yes, and there is.

02:37.620 --> 02:38.860
What is the difference?

02:39.140 --> 02:42.240
Do more people buy the fantasy books than buy the science fiction books?

02:43.660 --> 02:44.220
Yes.

02:45.940 --> 02:53.080
For the decade or so that I wrote science fiction before I got into fantasy in any big way,

02:53.900 --> 03:01.120
I would have sales of 50,000, 60,000 copies, 100,000, and some over the years some of my

03:01.120 --> 03:03.040
better ones would build up beyond that.

03:03.040 --> 03:09.620
I've only been into fantasy for the past five years and they're already selling in

03:09.620 --> 03:13.080
the quarter million copies of class.

03:13.680 --> 03:21.500
I think my first recent fantasy, the spell for chameleon, has now sold about 280,000

03:21.500 --> 03:27.420
copies, so it's just much bigger than the science fiction, much faster and much more.

03:29.980 --> 03:33.440
Why do you think there seems to be a fantasy craze now?

03:33.580 --> 03:37.540
Why do people snarf up the fantasy books more than the science fiction books of you

03:37.540 --> 03:38.340
or any other author?

03:39.800 --> 03:45.640
That's something that a lot of people are speculating on now and my answer may be fairly

03:45.640 --> 03:47.820
simple and others may not agree with it.

03:48.420 --> 03:52.440
For a number of years there simply wasn't much market for fantasy and everybody knew

03:52.440 --> 03:53.680
it, so nobody wrote it.

03:54.880 --> 04:00.480
Delray Books decided to take a plunge and get into fantasy in a big way.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.060
They tried to get good new authors, they tried to get old ones to convert over and do serious,

04:08.180 --> 04:09.140
well written fantasy.

04:09.680 --> 04:14.420
I was one of the ones that shifted over from science fiction to fantasy and apparently

04:14.420 --> 04:20.040
it worked because now most of the best-selling fantasy is with this one publisher, Delray

04:20.040 --> 04:20.380
Books.

04:21.440 --> 04:25.840
I conjecture that they took the plunge and it worked.

04:26.340 --> 04:32.120
When fantasy was given the same push as science fiction was, it had the same success and now

04:32.120 --> 04:38.780
is being carried on perhaps on momentum beyond the science fiction levels.

04:39.580 --> 04:45.180
Now most people will tell you there's a deep philosophical aspect that somehow people crave

04:45.180 --> 04:50.360
fantasy when they don't crave science fiction, but I don't see that the world is too much

04:50.360 --> 04:56.000
and it hasn't changed that much in five years to make people suddenly crave a genre that

04:56.000 --> 04:56.920
they didn't want before.

04:57.820 --> 05:03.880
I think again the answer has to be in the commercial aspect, in the push, in the advertising,

05:04.140 --> 05:06.380
in the promotion that they give the novels.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.980
I think people just didn't know about fantasy before.

05:10.880 --> 05:15.760
As I said, this is not an answer most people will give you and I'm not sure whether it's

05:15.760 --> 05:17.020
accurate, it's just my theory.

05:18.580 --> 05:23.300
How did you decide to write fantasy to take the plunge in your career?

05:23.820 --> 05:26.420
It was almost entirely coincidental.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.200
It's a long history.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.740
I'll try to digest this down.

05:31.460 --> 05:39.360
I've had a good deal of trouble in the genre because I stand up for my rights.

05:40.520 --> 05:47.120
One publisher was sending me, well they sent me statements of account that were simply

05:47.120 --> 05:47.700
not true.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.960
They were wrong and I knew they were wrong.

05:50.280 --> 05:56.500
I sent a letter demanding a correct statement and correct payments and rather than do that

05:56.500 --> 05:58.960
they blacklisted me.

05:59.640 --> 06:05.320
For six years they would not publish anything by me and this happened to be Valentine books.

06:06.840 --> 06:14.060
What changed in six years was that the administration there changed and new editors came in that

06:14.060 --> 06:15.720
weren't interested in blacklisting me.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.200
They happened to know that I had had the right of it.

06:19.240 --> 06:25.720
But by that time, in that six years, I had gotten in with other publishers and I don't

06:25.720 --> 06:31.940
know if you're familiar with this option clause in most contracts that say in general

06:32.540 --> 06:39.180
we reserve the right to publish or to approve and have the first purchase rights on this

06:39.180 --> 06:40.940
author's next piece of fiction.

06:41.520 --> 06:46.060
If they buy it then they put the clause in the next contract and so on so that you're

06:46.060 --> 06:47.620
locked into one publisher.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.840
I was locked into Avon Books on science fiction.

06:52.660 --> 06:56.700
Avon is where I went after Valentine Books blacklisted me.

06:57.880 --> 07:02.780
With the new administration at Valentine Books I wanted to try them out.

07:02.940 --> 07:07.440
I wanted to see if they really had changed and do a novel for them but I couldn't legally

07:07.440 --> 07:08.360
do science fiction.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.100
So I said well, supposing I try fantasy, I haven't done any, I don't know if it will

07:13.100 --> 07:17.400
work but if you're willing, happened at Lester Del Rey was the fantasy editor.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.120
I knew him, I met him, I liked him, I liked his kind of editing.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.520
So on that basis I got into fantasy.

07:24.980 --> 07:30.920
Again it was a commercial decision and then when I tried it I discovered I liked it and

07:30.920 --> 07:31.720
then it went from there.

07:33.380 --> 07:35.620
What was your first fantasy effort?

07:36.960 --> 07:43.520
Okay the first, the modern one, okay the very first one I did and put into print was a novel

07:43.520 --> 07:47.800
called Hassan and that took some years to get into print.

07:47.800 --> 07:55.560
And as I wrote it back in 1968 it was an adaptation of an Arabian knight's fantasy tale that

07:55.560 --> 08:01.040
I admired and I did some research and brought it up and fleshed it out and made it into

08:01.040 --> 08:01.480
a novel.

08:02.040 --> 08:11.840
It was published serially in Fantastic Magazine back in 1968 or 1969, 1970 somewhere in there.

08:12.360 --> 08:20.920
I couldn't get book publication but more recently when I say with the option complications

08:20.920 --> 08:28.280
or Valentine books I simply started a whole new framework for fantasy and that's when

08:28.280 --> 08:34.160
I did a spell for chameleon and this is what really dates my fantasy.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.580
That is I had done the one novel before but that never got me established in fantasy.

08:38.580 --> 08:44.740
I wasn't known as a fantasy writer and I regarded more as a, I wouldn't say a fluke, I worked

08:44.740 --> 08:45.500
hard on that novel.

08:45.820 --> 08:48.240
It was just something I did and did not return to.

08:48.740 --> 08:57.580
So that my first fantasy that got me really established as a fantasy writer was a spell

08:57.580 --> 08:59.800
for chameleon, the first Sands novel.

09:02.220 --> 09:07.020
Okay the Sands novels, I believe it would be an understatement to say have been successful.

09:08.800 --> 09:14.920
Did you have that, did you conceive of that as a series or did it just start building

09:14.920 --> 09:17.340
in your mind when you started writing a spell for chameleon?

09:17.700 --> 09:18.820
No, it was no series.

09:19.060 --> 09:24.540
It was an individual novel that I did to try out a publisher and an editor and for all

09:24.540 --> 09:28.360
I knew it would be just one novel that would never repeat.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.040
But then it worked so well.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.800
I liked it and the editor liked it.

09:33.980 --> 09:36.160
You see this is a two way street.

09:36.700 --> 09:40.060
The author has to like doing something but the editor also has to like his work.

09:40.700 --> 09:46.580
So before it was published the editor said will you do another fantasy for us and he

09:46.580 --> 09:52.860
was not thinking of another in the same framework and neither was I but when I got to thinking

09:52.860 --> 09:57.480
about it and working out and trying to find another fantasy set up I realized that there

09:57.480 --> 10:01.000
was more that I wanted to say about the land of Sands.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.080
I sort of liked it.

10:02.600 --> 10:07.300
So I asked him if it would be alright to do another one in that framework and I think

10:07.300 --> 10:14.060
a little bit reluctantly the editor agreed and we did it and then the thing was almost

10:14.060 --> 10:14.720
a bestseller.

10:14.820 --> 10:18.040
It did very well and that pretty well established Sands as a series.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.780
It kept on going.

10:19.960 --> 10:20.900
We did a third one.

10:21.140 --> 10:23.480
Said let's wrap it up as a trilogy and not do any more.

10:23.980 --> 10:29.500
Then the readers started demanding more and more and more and more and finally both the

10:29.500 --> 10:30.460
publisher and the author.

10:32.880 --> 10:37.760
It's hard to say no when the readers are begging for more really and so we have gone along

10:37.760 --> 10:40.460
and it's been very rewarding actually.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.760
How many books are projected for the series now?

10:45.360 --> 10:47.680
Well I think of it as an open-ended series.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.560
I have actually written seven.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.240
I'm finishing the seventh one now.

10:54.360 --> 10:58.720
I'm actually typing it right now and I have two more that I'm thinking of.

10:59.380 --> 11:03.500
As you see there are four in print but there will be two more coming out later this year.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.500
I'm bringing it up to six and then the seventh will appear about a year later and I think

11:08.500 --> 11:13.340
as long as the market holds up, as long as there's demand I'll probably do one more

11:13.340 --> 11:14.320
sense novel a year.

11:14.820 --> 11:15.620
Just indefinitely.

11:16.480 --> 11:21.280
When people get tired of sense and the sales go down, we'll quit.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.640
So it really has no end.

11:23.860 --> 11:27.600
I suspect that it may go one novel a year for the next 20 years.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.220
I don't know.

11:30.040 --> 11:34.940
I get the idea when reading the Xanth novels that you must be having a lot of fun when

11:34.940 --> 11:38.860
you're writing them because of the puns and the jokes and everything.

11:39.340 --> 11:40.060
They're really great.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.580
Yes, I do have fun.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.440
I say it's not what I regard great literature.

11:46.020 --> 11:50.520
It's not terrifically challenging but it has two things going for it.

11:50.580 --> 11:53.700
One is that it pays very well and that's all.

11:54.020 --> 11:57.240
In a recession like this it helps to have something you know will pay.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.800
The other is that it is an awful lot of fun to do.

12:00.980 --> 12:03.160
I can just get there and sort of relax.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.420
It's like being at home with your shoes off and just relaxing and enjoying yourself.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.720
I enjoy it more than just about anything else.

12:11.380 --> 12:18.360
But as I said, I like to do something with challenge so that I don't want to do nothing but sense.

12:18.980 --> 12:25.880
But in between other novels it's very nice to come back and just let myself go and work out puns

12:25.880 --> 12:28.800
that nobody else would tolerate in sense.

12:29.000 --> 12:29.480
They're all right.

12:30.220 --> 12:34.120
I probably enjoy writing them as much as my readers enjoy reading them.

12:36.320 --> 12:41.500
Do you have any plans to write any science fiction books in the near future?

12:42.020 --> 12:45.140
Yes, this is another long story and you'll probably have to edit this.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.260
No problem.

12:49.920 --> 12:54.460
In one of my most recently published science fiction novels, Viscous Circle,

12:55.480 --> 13:02.100
I had a long author's note explaining why I probably would not be writing much science fiction.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.700
Actually a number of my readers have been commenting.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.820
They thought that I wouldn't write any fantastic stuff.

13:08.920 --> 13:15.780
Actually I was writing fantasy but I planned to ease off on science fiction because I seem to have lost a sense of wonder.

13:16.060 --> 13:20.140
Of course, if I don't enjoy doing it, I don't want to do it.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.320
I talk about in sense that I do it for money but I also enjoy it.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.120
If I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't do it for the money.

13:26.520 --> 13:31.860
But with science fiction, I just wasn't enjoying it so much.

13:32.060 --> 13:36.260
I decided to go out and try a challenge in other areas.

13:36.740 --> 13:39.780
I wanted to work on a World War II novel, for example.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.320
It's historical, it's mainstream, all these other genres.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.820
Go out and try these things.

13:45.860 --> 13:51.960
Well, I'm still young enough and have my abilities with me so that I can tackle new things.

13:52.980 --> 14:02.320
But I discovered that in the past two years, there's nobody out there that's interested in my non-science fiction or fantasy work.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.860
World War II novel, nobody wants it.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.520
Historical, nobody wants it.

14:08.560 --> 14:12.880
Nobody wants anything I do if it's not science fiction or fantasy.

14:13.380 --> 14:16.220
Now I don't sound like the situation but I have to move with it.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.020
I can't sell outside of the genre.

14:18.020 --> 14:21.020
It has nothing to do with how good a writer I may be.

14:21.680 --> 14:25.100
If I listen to my fans within the genre, they think I'm one of the best.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.000
But outside, they couldn't care less.

14:28.340 --> 14:29.360
They're just not interested.

14:29.980 --> 14:34.900
So that if I'm going to write at all, I have to write within the genre.

14:36.620 --> 14:42.080
So, wrestling with this reality and I pride myself on being able to face reality,

14:42.680 --> 14:49.340
rather than unless I wanted to do 100% fantasy, I would have to return and find a way to do science fiction.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.440
And still satisfy myself.

14:52.600 --> 15:00.560
But when I thought it out, I realized that the boundaries of both science fiction and fantasy are very, very tenuous.

15:00.740 --> 15:09.040
You can call almost anything one genre or the other if you phrase it correctly.

15:09.500 --> 15:14.580
So in effect, what I did was stretch the boundaries of science fiction

15:14.580 --> 15:21.420
so that they would include the mainstream material that I really wanted to work on.

15:22.040 --> 15:30.300
And as a result, I have now sold to Avan Books a five novel science fiction series

15:30.300 --> 15:35.740
that is really a mainstream series close to science fiction.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.520
It's not that it doesn't have a science fiction trapping.

15:40.740 --> 15:46.120
It's very hard science and nobody would ever confuse it.

15:46.420 --> 15:49.560
But that the message in it, the theme, it's a mainstream theme.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.860
I'm dealing with the problems of the world and possible solutions to them.

15:54.300 --> 15:59.700
It could almost be written as an essay except that I am phrasing it as what I call space opera.

15:59.700 --> 16:07.560
That is, the original space opera is rather shallow material where it's like a horse opera.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.820
You have the cowboy on his horse galloping off.

16:10.920 --> 16:14.520
He pulls out his six gun. He shoots the bad guy. He gets the girl and everybody's happy.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.920
He translates this into science fiction.

16:17.540 --> 16:21.460
It's called space opera. He gets into a spaceship. He pulls out his blaster.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.220
He gets the girl and everybody's happy.

16:23.820 --> 16:30.680
Using this space opera science fiction framework, I'm actually doing considerable commentary

16:30.680 --> 16:35.080
not on western times but on contemporary times.

16:35.680 --> 16:40.240
That is, if you translate it from science fiction into the present, which you can easily do,

16:43.640 --> 16:46.660
I'm getting my thought all mixed up here.

16:46.660 --> 16:53.040
The fact is that although this is set in the solar system, our planet Jupiter, for example,

16:53.720 --> 16:56.260
translates very readily to the United States.

16:56.860 --> 17:01.320
When I talk about Jupiter and the Jupiter Space Navy, I'm talking about the United States

17:01.320 --> 17:02.480
and its military arm.

17:03.300 --> 17:07.980
Once a person has the key, you can discover that I'm telling a contemporary story.

17:09.060 --> 17:14.000
Many readers, perhaps the majority, will not see the key and they'll just read it as

17:14.000 --> 17:16.480
a straight science fiction adventure, which it is.

17:16.940 --> 17:21.920
It's a hard-hitting adventure. It's about as effective an adventure as I've ever done.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.960
When I went to the publisher with this idea, I said, look, supposing someone tried to write

17:27.960 --> 17:30.000
space opera, who could really write?

17:30.780 --> 17:35.280
It might sound conceited, suggest that other space opera writers didn't know how to write,

17:36.600 --> 17:41.980
but as may be apparent in this interview, I have a fairly high regard for my own abilities.

17:41.980 --> 17:48.880
I feel I am a good writer, and that if I tackle space opera, I could do a better job than most people

17:48.880 --> 17:53.020
before me have done, and that's what I'm trying to prove among other things.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.680
So, long, long, long answer here.

17:57.160 --> 18:01.920
I am back into science fiction. There'll be at least five novels one a year.

18:02.840 --> 18:10.920
It will be hard-hitting, but it does have more of a message, more of a theme, more relevance to today

18:10.920 --> 18:14.480
than, for example, Sants does, or almost anything else.

18:15.340 --> 18:19.640
And I'm a little worried if too many people catch on to the relevance, they may not like it,

18:19.760 --> 18:24.120
because many of my readers don't want messages. They don't want to be educated.

18:24.920 --> 18:31.620
But for those that do, that are interested in some philosophic or educational content, it's here.

18:32.380 --> 18:34.720
It's definitely here, and that pleases me.

18:34.900 --> 18:39.600
So I think I'm succeeding in doing what I wanted to without having to leave the genre.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.520
I hope that's not too confused an answer.

18:43.040 --> 18:50.480
No, no, that's not, and there's none of the people here listening disagree with your assessment of your writing abilities.

18:51.740 --> 18:55.620
Let's see. I said I had a high opinion that I was a good writer, and they disagree with that.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.800
No, we agree. We agree with you.

18:59.680 --> 19:07.040
So the kick in writing this new series then is this kind of coding the present day situation into a space opera situation.

19:07.040 --> 19:10.860
Yes, I said I wanted to do some more relevant comment.

19:11.220 --> 19:15.200
You haven't asked a question on this, but I'll give you the answer anyway.

19:15.760 --> 19:23.060
Anyway, I'd just like to think that I'm on Earth for some purpose other than just to feed my face.

19:23.660 --> 19:29.580
I want to do something and try to leave the universe a better place than it was when I came into it.

19:29.920 --> 19:34.220
If there's anything in my power I can do to improve things, then I want to do it.

19:34.220 --> 19:38.280
And I try to do this through the ability that I have as a writer.

19:39.320 --> 19:50.400
And so I want to write in the guise of fiction to write material that people will read and become better persons or get ideas that they wouldn't have.

19:50.760 --> 19:57.040
I've had some comments from Ben saying that after reading some of my novels, they're thinking of the Splits Infinity series,

19:57.780 --> 20:01.160
they've decided that honesty is the best policy. Now they admire honesty.

20:01.980 --> 20:04.600
Well, that pleases me. That's the kind of thing I want to do.

20:05.020 --> 20:12.140
If a person was planning to be dishonest and he reads one of my novels and then he decides that he really would rather be honest,

20:12.580 --> 20:16.320
I believe in honesty. I want to encourage him. I think there should be more of it in the world.

20:17.020 --> 20:23.380
So I am trying to have a beneficial effect. You might say to justify my own existence.

20:24.160 --> 20:28.960
I'm making money out of it, yes. But while I'm making the money, I also want to do something that,

20:28.960 --> 20:33.220
not when I die, I can look back and say I have done something useful in the world.

20:33.940 --> 20:41.700
So this is why I'm not satisfied just to write and get paid for it and not to worry about the theme or the content.

20:42.080 --> 20:47.360
I want to do something that I can be satisfied with, that I can be proud of, that will help people.

20:49.160 --> 20:54.560
You have alluded several times to the fact that your fans ask you to do this and your fans said that.

20:54.560 --> 21:01.420
I take it that you either correspond with fans or you do get quite a bit of fan mail and that you are responsive to it.

21:02.760 --> 21:08.660
Yes. It's a funny thing. I have never gone to a convention. I've never met people personally that way,

21:08.660 --> 21:13.700
mainly because I don't like to travel and I do like to write. But I do answer my mail.

21:15.520 --> 21:21.480
Yesterday, for last month, I simply went back and counted up the letters I had written. It was 64 letters.

21:23.280 --> 21:27.780
I had to take off all weekends just to answer my fan mail. This is a problem.

21:28.020 --> 21:34.600
If it gets much worse, I'm going to have to start smacking off on that because it takes me too long to finish a novel

21:34.600 --> 21:39.420
if I have to keep taking time off to answer the letters.

21:40.520 --> 21:48.360
But I am responsive. I do read them. I think about them. Each is an individual letter relating to what the fan has told me, what his needs are.

21:48.360 --> 21:52.160
You see, many of my letters are from children, 9, 10, 11, 12 years old.

21:53.660 --> 22:03.060
I think it's very important to them that I do answer them. When I was that age, I didn't like to be ignored when something was important to me.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.860
It's a golden rule. I try to treat them as I wish I had been treated.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.700
You might say, well, what does a guy 10 years old have to tell me?

22:16.500 --> 22:22.340
Well, actually, he can tell me how he feels, how he reacts, how important it is, and what influence my novel has had on him.

22:22.680 --> 22:28.380
He will do so with a lot more candor than an adult will because he's not trying to impress me.

22:28.460 --> 22:34.460
He's just telling me what he likes. He doesn't have the art to be for duplicity.

22:35.520 --> 22:42.240
It's a little like animal psychology. You can see the human motives in animals because the animals don't know enough to conceal them.

22:43.060 --> 22:46.920
I value these letters. I sometimes wish I just had more time.

22:47.280 --> 22:51.480
I could have full time for writing and also full time for answering letters.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.440
It's been mostly this year, considerable correspondence developing.

22:57.440 --> 23:06.000
I would say 50 or 60% of it is by people under the age of 18, mostly young readers.

23:09.620 --> 23:17.120
I hope I answered your question there. As you may notice, I can get to talking and I can wander so far on the subject that I forget what it is.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.940
I regret that, but it's just the way I am.

23:20.500 --> 23:25.120
Don't regret it. That's what makes the interviews very interesting.

23:25.840 --> 23:31.200
I have more to say than I can say and I get wandering and get lost.

23:32.260 --> 23:36.820
I'm not following my outline either. In fact, I'm going to work backwards instead of forwards.

23:39.720 --> 23:44.660
That's really nice about writing to the kids because I know that means a lot to them.

23:46.840 --> 23:52.520
The science fiction that you did immediately before Fantasy was the cluster of books.

23:52.660 --> 23:55.800
I assume that's an appropriate way to categorize them.

23:57.700 --> 24:04.620
They have a novelty and a creativity there that like nothing I've ever seen before in your writing or really in anything else.

24:04.780 --> 24:07.940
In fact, that seems to be blurred between fantasy and science fiction.

24:08.860 --> 24:14.580
How did you conceive of that series? Did you conceive of it as a series and then it just kind of went the way of the Xanth series?

24:15.020 --> 24:22.260
Yes, this is another one of these involved stories. I should say that I regard the cluster novels as science fantasy.

24:23.040 --> 24:30.940
The science standard is not real. I doubt that we'll ever have faster than like communication, for example.

24:33.300 --> 24:39.660
They call it science fiction. Actually, I regard most of science fiction that I or anybody else has been publishing as science fantasy.

24:40.800 --> 24:46.440
I don't want to get off too far on this but people talk about Larry Niven, for example, as a hard science fiction writer.

24:46.940 --> 24:54.420
I could pick a science apart. He's a science fantasy writer. Most of them are.

24:54.420 --> 25:01.480
The cluster is science fantasy and I can't really justify the science in it.

25:01.660 --> 25:07.120
My upcoming series will be science fiction. It has no fantasy at all, not science fantasy.

25:08.220 --> 25:14.500
That was a diversion from the question of a... You better rephrase the question. I haven't indeed lost it.

25:15.080 --> 25:21.420
The cluster series started out as a trilogy and then the related books...

25:21.420 --> 25:23.160
...did I get into that? Exactly.

25:24.900 --> 25:30.520
For purely irrelevant reason. I'd like to say that I just sat down and said let's do something constructive.

25:31.120 --> 25:37.140
In this case, it wasn't. You may have heard the name of Roger Elwood.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.460
I interviewed him about two weeks ago.

25:39.900 --> 25:50.440
Okay. But in a capsule, he did a lot of story editing and then he got into novels and he must have been a hundred or so novels that he did.

25:50.440 --> 25:56.960
He got quite a program there. But candidly, I do not regard him as a good editor.

25:57.780 --> 26:04.540
In fact, I was one that helped to put him out of business because of what he did to one of my novels.

26:06.720 --> 26:17.940
But before this happened, he wrote to me and said, look, you're a good writer. Why don't you do something really big like Azamos Foundation trilogy?

26:18.420 --> 26:26.760
See what you can do. Well, that appealed to me. I've been an admirer of the Foundation trilogy since my youth.

26:27.860 --> 26:29.500
Can you hear me? I hear a lot of noise on the line.

26:29.980 --> 26:33.280
Yeah, I can hear the noise. Just go ahead. I think we'll be able to filter it out.

26:33.780 --> 26:43.440
Okay. And when I read something that I admire, sometimes I like to rise to the challenge and see if I can match it.

26:43.440 --> 26:48.720
Not copying it, just to see if I can do something of similar scope and importance.

26:49.460 --> 26:55.360
So I settled down in the course of an hour. I conceived the initial cluster trilogy.

26:55.640 --> 27:04.980
It's not five novels, but it started out as a trilogy, worked it up and presented it as a trilogy to Roger Elwood.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.000
And he rejected it.

27:07.480 --> 27:11.940
Now, I feel that I had presented to him exactly what he asked for.

27:12.880 --> 27:19.220
Unfortunately, he liked many editors. If there's one thing an editor will reject, it's what he asks for. I don't know why this is.

27:19.900 --> 27:24.060
So I went ahead and sold it to Abon. They published it, and it's been highly successful ever since.

27:24.720 --> 27:32.140
And I'd like to tell people now that the cluster trilogy is a project I worked up for Elwood and did it without him.

27:32.980 --> 27:41.820
You can judge the quality of it. The one novel I did for him was one called But What a Birth that got illegally rendered into a collaboration,

27:41.980 --> 27:47.680
and I don't recommend it to people at all. I regard it as a poor novel, the way it finally was presented.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.900
That's an example of what I was able to do with Elwood.

27:51.380 --> 27:58.680
So for me, I was better off without him, but the cluster trilogy was conceived for Roger Elwood, believe it or not.

27:59.420 --> 28:00.840
That is where it started.

28:04.140 --> 28:15.460
The Tarot Religion figured very heavily in the cluster series. When did you decide to do the sidebar novels, the trilogy telling us about the Tarot Religion?

28:16.360 --> 28:26.600
Okay, first that's not a trilogy. It was one quarter million word novel. I wrote it in one piece, and it published it at bulk at size.

28:26.600 --> 28:34.560
I don't know why in mainstream people can get quarter million word novels published and they're best sellers, but in science fiction they wouldn't do it for me.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.780
They insisted on breaking it up.

28:39.460 --> 28:51.060
Well, my agent and I fought this. We even went to the extent of taking about a 30% cut in the payment for the sole reason to have it published as one novel.

28:51.680 --> 29:01.800
So they gave us the, I think they offered $15,000 and they cut it to $11,500 for it and signed the agreement that they would publish it as one novel.

29:03.040 --> 29:12.340
Whereupon they broke it up into three. They didn't give me back the money and publisher published the first third of it and went out of business.

29:12.340 --> 29:18.180
That was Joe. Joe was brought out by the combine that, you know, Berkeley was part of.

29:18.880 --> 29:25.160
Berkeley went ahead, published the other two novels in a different year so that I couldn't even get my novel published in one year.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.540
That bothered me because I feel that this is the major novel of my career.

29:30.080 --> 29:38.160
Split into three parts and divided between two years. It washed me out totally. I had no chance to make a run for any awards or anything like that.

29:38.160 --> 29:43.220
It was simply gone, which is what tends to happen to my more important work.

29:44.980 --> 29:53.200
So I'm rather put out about this because I felt the major work of my career was virtually destroyed by the publisher.

29:53.480 --> 30:01.580
Not that the publisher set out to do that, but I mean by the publisher going out of business right in the middle of my novel, by refusing to honor the original commitment.

30:02.260 --> 30:06.140
Part of the agreement was when they finally broke it up, I had to sign a paper saying,

30:06.340 --> 30:12.320
all right, if you've got to break it up, you've got to, but never will this be referred to as a trilogy because it's not.

30:12.920 --> 30:23.020
See, I write, when I write a novel, it's complete. I tie up the loose ends and to publish a third of a novel and then call it a full novel in itself, that's just not the way I write.

30:23.100 --> 30:26.640
Other people write that way. I'm aware of it. I don't. I like to wrap up my loose ends.

30:27.500 --> 30:32.600
As it happened, I saw a review of it the first third. The reviewer never even realized it was only a third of a novel.

30:33.260 --> 30:35.560
So apparently he's used to seeing these fragments.

30:37.740 --> 30:41.480
So I'm rather put out about the way Tarot worked.

30:42.020 --> 30:48.660
As for the writing of the novel itself, it was worked up for another publisher that never took it.

30:51.060 --> 31:02.100
And in combination with the material that every religious group had sent me, I had met one of their people, admired his attitude.

31:02.280 --> 31:05.920
It was a small religion. They want to be anonymous, so I keep them anonymous.

31:07.580 --> 31:15.980
And he wrote to his home office and they sent me about half a million words of background material on their philosophy, on their beliefs.

31:15.980 --> 31:25.480
And I looked through this and said, this is worth putting in a novel. This is worth immortalizing to whatever extent I can.

31:26.300 --> 31:36.920
And so I based a novel on it. Part of that material was the Tarot, where I think I've heard of the Tarot before, but I've never seen it.

31:37.040 --> 31:42.840
I've never paid any attention. I just understood it was just a minor fortune telling deck of cards and that was it.

31:42.840 --> 31:53.760
But when I actually saw the images, I started looking at the cards, such as death, really came across to me that this is a unique deck.

31:54.020 --> 32:03.400
It's quite different from the ordinary card playing deck. I bought a deck of my own, tried spreading out a reading, and it was amazing.

32:03.920 --> 32:08.700
I should say I don't believe in the supernatural. I have absolutely no belief in anything supernatural.

32:08.700 --> 32:16.700
So I try these things as an experiment. I said, okay, let's ask a question and lay out according to the formula and see what the cards say.

32:17.500 --> 32:27.940
And the cards answered my questions. And this got to me. I said, I don't believe in the supernatural. How can the supernatural agency work for me?

32:29.080 --> 32:35.560
And again, by the time I finished figuring that out, I had a novel on the hand. I think I did figure out how it worked.

32:35.560 --> 32:46.820
I regard it as a psychological tool, not as a supernatural one, but it is a good one. It relates to Rorschach.

32:46.900 --> 32:53.300
I think you know the ink blobs, where they analyze, people tell stories about them. I think the cards, the symbols do this even better.

32:54.220 --> 33:03.400
So that originally, through this religious group that was just showing me its material, they introduced me to the tarot and to other concepts,

33:03.460 --> 33:09.440
and I simply went ahead and worked with those and put them into the novel that became tarot.

33:09.900 --> 33:20.540
It's unfortunate that when I sent a copy of the manuscript to the elders or whatever you call it, of this religion, they cut off all communication.

33:20.540 --> 33:28.780
Apparently they didn't like it, and I've never heard from them since. So apparently they do not feel that I succeeded in presenting their philosophy.

33:29.500 --> 33:36.180
I've had comments from people of other religions saying, hey, we really believe in this. Is there such a religion? We'd like to join us.

33:36.760 --> 33:43.600
But the one that it was actually based on apparently does not at all like it. That's been one of my regrets.

33:44.220 --> 33:49.980
In that sense I failed. I thought I was presenting their philosophy, and it's evident that I did not.

33:50.680 --> 34:00.180
So you might say in that sense a tarot is a failure, even though commercially and critically it's been a success, I would say.

34:01.200 --> 34:10.340
So what came first, the tarot religion or the cluster trilogy, which incorporated it? And then you went back and explained what it was.

34:10.900 --> 34:18.360
I was doing the research. See, I work ahead. So I was doing research and looking at things and just studying things in general.

34:19.280 --> 34:25.280
I'd like to say now I learn more each year than I ever did in school or college, just because I like knowledge.

34:26.860 --> 34:35.320
And so I was working on the cluster novels at this time, and this material suddenly gave a new direction to it.

34:35.320 --> 34:45.700
So I put in tarot scenes, one major scene, one chapter in each of the cluster novels. It had not originally been there, and I built.

34:46.560 --> 34:57.540
I merged the frameworks. Tarot is in the cluster framework, and the tarot material appears in the cluster novels.

34:57.540 --> 35:06.200
It was a kind of a meeting, you might say, of two ideas, the tarot idea and the framework that I had already developed for the cluster novels.

35:09.160 --> 35:20.540
I was glad to hear you say while I go that this is one of your favorite works, because my question 13 says, in some ways, this is my favorite of your work, because I really enjoyed it.

35:20.540 --> 35:30.460
And I think the part I really enjoyed more than anything was in the middle book, Vision of Tarot, when Paul and Carolyn went back to Earth or whatever and had their experiences.

35:30.900 --> 35:37.200
And I always kind of interpreted that as it might be a little bit autobiographical. Is there any autobiography in there?

35:39.240 --> 35:54.560
Yeah, I had sold the novel. I had no longer write novels and then sell them. I sell them and then I write them. I do a summary of what I propose to do, and if I get a contract on it, then I go ahead and write it.

35:54.580 --> 36:00.780
That's the way I sold cluster, I sell all of them that way now. So I had a contract for it, and I was getting ready to work on it.

36:01.920 --> 36:09.600
I was at that point invited to go back to my alma mater, the college I have my BA in writing from.

36:10.880 --> 36:20.320
A professor who had worked with me on the writing asked me to come back and talk to them. And because he asked me and I felt I owed him,

36:20.320 --> 36:32.020
well, he'd helped me in various ways. I was a naturalized citizen. I was a British subject. And he helped serve as a witness for a character for me so that I could become an American citizen.

36:32.800 --> 36:39.160
I mean, these are not things that I forget. So that although I don't like to travel, I like to stay home. I said, this time I'll do it.

36:39.160 --> 36:47.220
And so I went there. And because I like to have my children have good experiences. I took my eight year old, she was then eight years old,

36:47.380 --> 36:54.580
daughter along with me and that way she got to ride on the airplane. She got to see the college, she got to meet people, she got a lot of good experience.

36:55.840 --> 37:05.760
Well, that experience became those two central chapters. That college is my college. I didn't name it. It's dangerous to name things you can get sued.

37:05.760 --> 37:16.720
However, the professor, Will Hamlin, is real. I used his name with his permission and sent him a copy of the novel when it was published.

37:18.540 --> 37:30.920
The college is as described, the events are as described. It is a summary of my own life there. I was suspended from it. I felt unfairly.

37:30.920 --> 37:42.520
And that I think comes through. When we came back, the airline refused to honor my ticket. It was a valid ticket. It had been paid for.

37:42.620 --> 37:49.000
I had a confirmed reservation, paid for two weeks in advance. They wouldn't let me on the airplane. Turned out to be a mix-up.

37:49.200 --> 37:56.940
But I mean, I had to go and get another airplane, get back. My daughter and I were almost stranded up there in New England.

37:57.500 --> 38:09.180
So that I simply put this into the novel and hoped that it didn't stand out as too much in contrast with the rest of it.

38:09.720 --> 38:16.080
I had read a section of the very first chapter I had already written at that point. I read it to them there at the college.

38:16.740 --> 38:21.420
And then went ahead and put the college experience into a later segment of the novel.

38:22.580 --> 38:29.820
In my novels, some of them are totally fantastic and others have a great deal of my personal life in them.

38:30.860 --> 38:38.640
And in the case of Tarot, most of it is fantastic that it's in the sense that it's created as a work of fantasy or science fiction.

38:38.860 --> 38:48.620
In this case, the boundary is obscure. But some of it relates to my own life and relates most directly.

38:48.620 --> 38:56.080
Those two chapters do. There's another episode, The Day in the Life of an Eight-Year-Old Boy. That's me.

38:57.240 --> 39:01.900
And it didn't have a happy childhood and the nature of that childhood is covered in that.

39:02.040 --> 39:10.440
That's in the third volume, I think, part of the health sequence. So that I am in there in certain selected areas.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.480
I'm pleased if you actually liked that section. I was afraid I would get criticized that people wouldn't like and say,

39:16.480 --> 39:20.080
what's this business about college doing in a science fiction novel?

39:21.000 --> 39:31.800
But so far, nobody's objected. One person who had been an instructor at a college and left it for philosophical reasons

39:32.600 --> 39:36.520
commented on that section, said how much it related to his own experience.

39:37.220 --> 39:48.080
Apparently these internecine politics come in all over and people leave or are suspended or are given poor grades, whatever you want.

39:48.660 --> 39:54.880
In my case, the grades as a whole different subject as covered in the novel.

39:55.020 --> 40:00.520
It is true that I went through four years of college without ever receiving a grade and then discovered later

40:00.520 --> 40:09.980
that I had in fact been covertly graded and I felt that was a great violation of their compact with me and with the other students.

40:10.600 --> 40:16.760
And I put the hurt into that novel. I do not like being deceived. I don't like it at all.

40:16.880 --> 40:23.040
I resent it very strongly and in this particular case I felt the college had a lot better than they knew.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.520
I felt they had a good system. I just wish they had believed in it themselves.

40:27.420 --> 40:32.800
Some of this is like the Post Office. I wish they really believed in the zip code and used it, but they don't.

40:33.920 --> 40:43.680
Some systems are good if they're used and the people that are supposed to use it show that they don't really believe in themselves.

40:46.420 --> 40:50.980
I'm curious how much fan response you got from the Tarot novel.

40:51.500 --> 41:01.720
I for one got more mileage out of telling the joke about Brigham Young ought to be hung than about any other joke I've ever read.

41:02.640 --> 41:08.260
But I would think that some people if they looked hard enough could get offended at that. Did you get much mail on that?

41:09.160 --> 41:17.480
I expected to get hate mail from the Mormons although I was not portraying them negatively. I had zero mail from that direction.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.480
I doubt if they read much science fiction early.

41:20.720 --> 41:28.400
I mean that's the case. And I've had a number of letters over the years on Tarot. Most of them are concerned with the Tarot deck.

41:28.860 --> 41:36.520
We haven't gotten into the deck and then I tried to understand it and then work up a deck that would suit my purposes because the regular ones did not.

41:36.520 --> 41:43.520
So I worked out. I did research, found out what I thought were the true origins of the Tarot, built that into fiction.

41:44.320 --> 41:49.660
Those origins of that notion was not original with me. It was a result of the research that convinced me.

41:51.200 --> 41:56.740
And so most of the fan letters there are saying is there a deck being published or what about this?

41:56.840 --> 41:59.560
Some people are drawing up illustrations for the deck.

42:02.020 --> 42:09.820
Right now I have a letter I have to answer someone that wishes to make a comic book, a series of comic books out of the first volume of the Tarot novel.

42:10.380 --> 42:15.220
Somebody else does want to publish the animation Tarot as a deck. Work it up.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.960
So my correspondence has been mostly, you might say, technical, that nature.

42:19.640 --> 42:28.100
Sometimes I dread it when I see a letter come through Berkeley Books which means that it's Tarot because that's the only one I have in print.

42:28.100 --> 42:31.740
Well, I have another novel in print with them but mainly it's Tarot.

42:32.340 --> 42:40.280
I dread it not because I don't like the mail but because I know that I'm likely to sit down for an hour and digest a complicated and thoughtful letter.

42:40.640 --> 42:45.520
It's really much easier to digest a Zant letter where the typical letter just says,

42:45.900 --> 42:49.640
Gee, I'm 11 years old. You're the best writer in the world. Please send me your autograph.

42:50.320 --> 42:55.520
And I send the letters back saying it's very nice to hear from you. I'm glad you like it. Here's my signature.

42:56.240 --> 43:01.860
That takes me about 15 minutes. With a Tarot, I can't do a Tarot letter in 15 minutes.

43:01.980 --> 43:09.200
I have to dig out my mocked up deck. I have to check references and deal with people that know more about the subject than I do.

43:09.420 --> 43:14.340
That's always awkward. But as far as hate mail, I haven't had any hate mail.

43:15.020 --> 43:18.980
Matter of fact, I haven't had any hate mail on anything in the last five years or so.

43:19.920 --> 43:24.840
The hate letter I ever got, I think, based on a martial arts series I did some years ago,

43:25.540 --> 43:33.420
we had a comment about Bruce Lee being popular and martial arts, about how these things were faked up, having impossible jumps and so on.

43:33.680 --> 43:39.180
Why do that? When I've been in judo and so on, I mean, these are good martial arts.

43:39.300 --> 43:43.520
They don't need to be faked up to be effective. That was the nature of the comment in those novels.

43:43.520 --> 43:50.500
I had a hate letter on that thing. It was an unsigned four letter vernacular type letter.

43:50.960 --> 43:57.120
The very idea that we should criticize Bruce Lee. I hated it. That's about the only hate letter I've had, I think.

43:58.940 --> 44:08.760
The books we've talked about so far, the series as a reader, I appreciated the covers, the Walotsky covers on the cluster books,

44:08.760 --> 44:15.240
the Rowena covers on the taros. Yeah, and then I liked the various Xanth books.

44:15.820 --> 44:20.200
Do you pay attention to what the cover looks like and do you like them or dislike them this way?

44:20.200 --> 44:26.800
I pay attention, but I have absolutely no control over it. I think British covers are better. They seem to have more taste.

44:27.980 --> 44:34.380
They're doing them for the taro volumes now, I think better covers than the American ones.

44:35.040 --> 44:42.200
No, it's the publisher decides what the cover theme is going to be and then assigns the artist.

44:42.460 --> 44:46.480
And I find out when the book is published or sometimes they'll send me a cover proof.

44:46.780 --> 44:49.660
Just for my information, I have no veto power or anything.

44:51.180 --> 44:56.020
So in the contract, it's their power and I simply don't hassle them about it.

44:56.680 --> 45:03.100
The fact is, sometimes I am displeased with covers. I saw a book of mine once republished in Europe.

45:03.620 --> 45:09.900
They took the cover from the American edition of a Philip Jose farmer novel and put it on my book.

45:10.840 --> 45:12.860
I mean, I recognize that I had the book you see.

45:13.800 --> 45:20.760
So now I think Philip Jose farmer is a fine rager, but I don't want his cover on my novel. I'm sure he doesn't want it either.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.920
I mean, that's all some of these publishers care about covers.

45:24.800 --> 45:28.800
They'll just reuse one from an old novel and figure, I mean, not even by the same author.

45:29.060 --> 45:33.460
You can tell that it wouldn't be relevant to the new novel.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.740
I don't like that sort of thing, but again, I have no control.

45:38.720 --> 45:42.580
In the case of that, that was for a German translation I wrote to my agent and said,

45:42.940 --> 45:45.940
why did they do this? Aren't they aware that it's not even a...

45:45.940 --> 45:47.960
I mean, people are going to recognize this farmer cover.

45:49.180 --> 46:00.740
And they wrote back and said, well, the cover on the British edition was too severe for the German taste.

46:00.980 --> 46:04.800
The Germans were, you know, delicate people and they couldn't have a cover that was too violent.

46:05.840 --> 46:10.220
I just wrote back, I see you think you're kidding and let it go. Nothing I could do.

46:12.280 --> 46:18.400
I was wondering what it's like to see an artist rendition of your character. Does it ever match your idea?

46:18.980 --> 46:25.040
It depends on the artist. Some artists are very good. This is Rowena. It's very good.

46:26.040 --> 46:31.520
Some of them aren't even to my novel. They have no relevance.

46:34.860 --> 46:41.740
So it's like playing roulette, really, a cover. I wish I had more control. I had no control.

46:41.880 --> 46:46.140
I wish I had some because for eight years I was trying to be an artist.

46:46.360 --> 46:55.220
I gave it up and turned to writing because I felt my skill was not enough for me ever to be a commercial or professional artist.

46:55.680 --> 47:00.520
I wasn't that good. I shifted to words and as it turned out after another eight years,

47:02.540 --> 47:07.740
I became good enough to sell. It took me eight years of writing before I sold anything.

47:08.320 --> 47:12.360
So for me, words were the better medium. But I do know something about art.

47:12.780 --> 47:20.320
I did hope to be a painter myself someday. I feel competent to judge whether a cover is relevant and good or whether it's bad.

47:21.060 --> 47:28.660
And with me, I think it's about 50% of the covers. My books are good and about 50% I could just about do better myself.

47:29.620 --> 47:31.800
Okay, we're at the end of our tape.
