00:01.040 --> 00:05.840
He operated a bulldozer in Puerto Rico and a hotel in the West Indies.

00:06.060 --> 00:10.880
He trained as a circus aerialist, served three years as a seaman, and worked in advertising.

00:12.200 --> 00:16.300
Now, if you think this sounds like the typical biography of an American author, you're right.

00:17.320 --> 00:20.340
His name is Theodore Sturgeon, but he's not exactly typical.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.740
His numerous stories and novels are chiefly in the area of science fiction or fantasy.

00:27.740 --> 00:33.060
He's one of only three writers who have won all three of the major science fiction awards,

00:33.320 --> 00:37.320
the International Fatasy Award, the Hugo and the Nebula Awards.

00:38.160 --> 00:45.360
Mr. Sturgeon has been in the area attending Conclave 3, a meeting of science fiction writers

00:45.360 --> 00:49.980
and fans sponsored by the Eastern Michigan University Science Fiction Society.

00:50.940 --> 00:55.260
Mr. Sturgeon, let me leap feet foremost into this.

00:55.260 --> 01:04.660
And I'll ask you first what in your view is the major difference between science fiction today

01:04.660 --> 01:07.620
and other types of imaginative writing?

01:08.200 --> 01:13.220
Well, essentially you're asking me for a definition of science fiction, and I have to tell you with the outset

01:13.740 --> 01:18.360
that nobody has yet succeeded in defining science fiction in a way that does not leak,

01:19.140 --> 01:22.280
with the possible exception of Damon Knight, who said,

01:22.280 --> 01:26.720
science fiction is whatever you happen to be pointing at when you're talking about it.

01:27.320 --> 01:33.280
There are those who claim that I have never written a science fiction story in my life.

01:34.020 --> 01:41.840
These are the hardcore nuts and bolts, zap guns, space flight, hard chemistry, hard biology type.

01:42.020 --> 01:46.060
They don't feel that science fiction is science fiction without it.

01:46.180 --> 01:46.900
Or gimmick.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.000
That's right.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.440
Good science fiction has, first of all, I think, to be good fiction.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.740
Good fiction is people.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.720
A lot of science fiction does lack that particular quality.

01:59.180 --> 02:04.100
Those qualities of compassion and of love and of internal growth

02:04.100 --> 02:07.480
and so on, where the person is the most important thing.

02:08.160 --> 02:13.180
Good fiction is the interaction between people and ideas.

02:13.940 --> 02:16.180
If you write a story about an idea only,

02:16.180 --> 02:20.000
you might have something very compelling, but it's a tract.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.020
It isn't a story.

02:22.220 --> 02:25.120
I really start from there, and this is why, as I say, I have been accused

02:25.120 --> 02:30.440
by the hardcore science fiction addicts of not writing real science fiction at all.

02:30.920 --> 02:36.480
Yet I have done a lot about space flight and about biology and about evolution and so on.

02:36.660 --> 02:40.140
Well, I sometimes wondered, Francis, a writer like Donald Barthel, may,

02:42.100 --> 02:46.000
is not so very far, in some ways, from some science fiction.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.360
This is a very interesting thing.

02:47.520 --> 02:53.420
Science fiction is coming out of its own special ghetto, which it lived for about 40 years.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.600
There's an interesting thing about people who survive ghetto living.

02:58.180 --> 03:01.500
They come out strong, because if they're going to survive at all,

03:01.560 --> 03:02.840
they have to be a little bit stronger.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.900
I think you'll find a larger percentage of good writing

03:07.900 --> 03:12.300
and of really fascinating, good inventive thinking in the area of science fiction

03:12.300 --> 03:13.880
than you'll find in anywhere else.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.480
You see it exploding all around you now.

03:17.180 --> 03:20.320
In 1965, there were two courses in science fiction,

03:20.620 --> 03:22.860
one in Pennsylvania and one in Eastern New Mexico.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.060
This year, there are close to 3,000,

03:26.620 --> 03:30.880
and one of my endeavors recently has been teaching teachers,

03:31.620 --> 03:34.580
teaching a symposium of teachers of science fiction,

03:34.740 --> 03:40.280
because with 3,000 courses, there's nobody to teach it without taking a special course.

03:40.340 --> 03:42.540
What they end up doing is teaching writing, really.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.300
Essentially, yeah. And there's really nothing wrong with that.

03:45.860 --> 03:49.600
Now, there's a snob situation involved here, too.

03:51.220 --> 03:54.540
Vladimir Nabokov's last, I think it was his last novel, it was called Ada.

03:55.560 --> 03:59.080
And it's an alternate universe story in which the Germans won the First World War.

03:59.780 --> 04:01.760
It is definitely a science fiction story.

04:01.860 --> 04:03.960
Nobody calls Nabokov a science fiction writer.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.940
Kurt Vonnegut Jr. refuses to be called a science fiction writer.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.840
He's afraid it'll affect his sales.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.840
Well, you've got a man like Thomas Pynchon writing.

04:14.260 --> 04:15.140
With Gravity's Rainbow.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.140
Very much like science fiction.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.440
It certainly is. Didn't he write or wrote V?

04:21.700 --> 04:23.300
V is Pynchon, yeah.

04:24.140 --> 04:25.480
Which also is science fiction.

04:25.620 --> 04:28.920
So, Doris Lessing is a very highly-touted literary writer.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.660
That's right. Her last novel about London in the future.

04:32.940 --> 04:33.420
That's right.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.920
Kings and Amos, with whom I violently disagree on most points,

04:36.920 --> 04:38.560
didn't make a very, very good one.

04:39.660 --> 04:43.920
When he said that the reaction of the so-called serious critic

04:44.620 --> 04:46.820
and the public at large is,

04:47.240 --> 04:49.700
hey, this is science fiction. It can't be good.

04:50.060 --> 04:52.980
Or, hey, this is good. It can't be science fiction.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.940
You have stated elsewhere that you try to alter your style constantly.

04:59.620 --> 05:00.880
And I wonder about that.

05:00.880 --> 05:06.600
Don't you think that every author unconsciously identifies himself

05:06.600 --> 05:08.840
through a style which he develops?

05:08.860 --> 05:10.260
Not every author. It's true.

05:10.340 --> 05:13.740
You can get an awful long way in the literary business by developing a style

05:14.420 --> 05:16.860
and being inventive about Hemingway did it.

05:17.740 --> 05:21.840
For example, Bradbury is a perfect example.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.200
But, you know, with a little bit of study and some natural talent,

05:26.700 --> 05:29.680
you can sit down and write one paragraph of perfect Hemingway.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.540
One paragraph of perfect Steinbeck.

05:33.080 --> 05:38.740
But wouldn't you prefer to be identified as yourself, as Sturgeon,

05:38.880 --> 05:41.180
rather than Bradbury or Hemingway or whoever?

05:41.360 --> 05:44.000
Anyway, yes. But, you see, I think that that, in a way, is a limitation.

05:45.020 --> 05:47.760
There is a distinction between something which is original

05:47.760 --> 05:49.020
and something which is unique.

05:50.700 --> 05:53.840
Something is original is that something can be done the first time

05:53.840 --> 05:56.860
and once people see how it's done, everybody can do it.

05:56.860 --> 05:59.520
Mickey Spillane was, in that sense, an original.

05:59.980 --> 06:05.020
As soon as he did what he did, my hundreds of writers started to do the same thing.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.380
And Hemingway, also the same thing.

06:07.460 --> 06:08.480
And Steinbeck, to a degree.

06:09.980 --> 06:16.560
Even Kipling and Robert Louis Stevenson had a very distinctive style,

06:17.560 --> 06:18.360
H. Widerhaeger.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.080
But just try to write a paragraph, an identifiable paragraph,

06:24.080 --> 06:26.000
of Samuel R. Delaney, for example.

06:26.860 --> 06:29.660
A science fiction writer and a writer of the highest caliber.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.180
When he writes Black Ghetto, it is the real thing.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.960
When, in the novel, people are discussing modern American poetry,

06:39.400 --> 06:41.580
they do it in the idiom of William Carlos Williams.

06:42.580 --> 06:44.080
And he knows what he's talking about.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.000
He can change the whole texture and style of what he's saying.

06:48.780 --> 06:52.340
And this is a quality that I admire very, very much indeed.

06:52.340 --> 06:57.020
You get bogged down sometimes, however, in the attempt to change your style.

06:57.140 --> 06:57.280
No.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.200
It's just come naturally.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.000
Not particularly.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.440
I guess it's, I have a good ear.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.500
And I'm more interested in people than in anything else.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.740
And I listen to people.

07:07.620 --> 07:11.540
And I report either what it is they say, or what it is I wish they had said.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.920
But in the way they say it.

07:14.840 --> 07:19.620
And of course, eliminating me, errs and ahs and hums that you run across.

07:19.620 --> 07:23.300
And if you've ever read, and I know you have, of course, in your business,

07:23.440 --> 07:27.180
you would have a typed transcript of a speech.

07:27.500 --> 07:27.880
Terrible.

07:28.180 --> 07:28.900
It's just awful.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.080
Yes, it really is.

07:31.300 --> 07:36.720
You've also been quoted as saying that writing is a way of getting even with people.

07:36.800 --> 07:41.640
Now that sounds very pessimistic and misanthropic.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.600
And you definitely are not that sort of person yourself.

07:45.820 --> 07:46.920
What did you mean by that?

07:46.920 --> 07:50.680
Well, I think this is true really of all writers.

07:51.120 --> 07:55.440
Particularly writers who write, who take their craft seriously.

07:57.040 --> 08:01.460
And yet often unbeknownst to the writer himself, he is in that sense getting even.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.300
Getting even is not necessarily a vengeful thing.

08:05.260 --> 08:08.900
Sometimes it's an attempt to understand why you were hurt.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.740
Why did this person hurt me?

08:13.300 --> 08:13.960
Is it your puzzle?

08:14.180 --> 08:14.780
You're bewildered.

08:14.780 --> 08:21.140
You write a story and before you know it, there's a character in there who has been hurt in the same way.

08:21.860 --> 08:27.760
And from the narrative, even if it's a subplot or a subsidiary line in the story,

08:28.720 --> 08:30.660
a reason for that hurt evolves.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.820
You begin to understand better why you were hurt.

08:33.860 --> 08:37.080
And perhaps you recognize the fact you deserve to be hurt in that instance.

08:37.660 --> 08:40.540
So it isn't particularly a vengeful thing of getting even.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.240
It's a question of understanding your fellow human beings.

08:43.240 --> 08:49.460
I assume that you have developed some fairly strong opinions, beliefs over the years,

08:49.560 --> 08:53.760
whether it be in the area of society or politics or whatever.

08:54.400 --> 09:02.100
Do you consciously utilize these beliefs in your stories, attempt to grind to certain acts, let's say?

09:02.480 --> 09:06.960
I think rather than trying to persuade anybody else to my way of thinking,

09:07.440 --> 09:10.280
I continually attempt to crystallize my own thinking.

09:10.280 --> 09:15.660
If there's a flaw in its logic, if there's a prejudice, if there's an unthought conclusion,

09:16.800 --> 09:18.640
it becomes open for grabs.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.780
And one of my characters is a bigot, for example.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.400
I expose his bigotry.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.440
I mean, I pursue his logic until it becomes ridiculous.

09:32.180 --> 09:36.320
Or I do analogies of people.

09:37.200 --> 09:41.880
I remember I wrote a story one time about, essentially about Joseph McCarthy.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.340
It was a parallel story.

09:45.480 --> 09:49.060
It was cast in the future, dealt with other planets in space, flight, and so on.

09:49.660 --> 09:52.100
But I felt very strongly about that at the time.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.780
And I had to figure out what it is that the man was doing.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.660
Why was he doing what he was doing?

09:58.340 --> 10:02.060
Aside from the course, he was after a certain amount of power.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.700
And there was that within him which demanded a lot of public attention.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.980
But those things are basically superficial.

10:09.540 --> 10:11.080
Why did he want public attention?

10:11.560 --> 10:12.640
Why did he want power?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.000
What was his motivations there?

10:15.020 --> 10:17.840
And so the character was a story called Mr. Costello, hero.

10:19.720 --> 10:24.160
I went right down to the nitty-gritty to find out why a man does a thing like that.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.800
Joe McCarthy, incidentally, was a very fascinating man.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.900
He had two sets of realities.

10:32.160 --> 10:36.360
One of them was the one that stood up in front of the microphones and waved a paper in his hands and said,

10:36.840 --> 10:40.380
I hold in my hand 248 names of communists in the State Department.

10:41.520 --> 10:48.240
And another naive, kind of almost childlike,

10:49.640 --> 10:56.200
I remember one episode where he was riding in an elevator with Richard Rovere, a reporter who did a great deal of work on him.

10:56.200 --> 11:00.540
And Dean Atchison, a man he had virtually destroyed, stepped into the elevator.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.060
And McCarthy said, hey Dean, how you been?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.660
In a very friendly way.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.440
Atchison's lips got white, his ears got red.

11:10.540 --> 11:11.940
Elevator stopped and he got out.

11:12.780 --> 11:16.640
And McCarthy turned to Richard Rovere and said, hey, what's the matter with him?

11:16.940 --> 11:17.700
Has he mad at me?

11:18.800 --> 11:21.940
And that was, I mean, said in real innocence, in absolute innocence.

11:22.860 --> 11:25.620
There's a part missing in people like that.

11:26.260 --> 11:32.540
See, I'm not holding them up as a devil at all, but it's a very, very fascinating kind of human being.

11:33.060 --> 11:41.280
Mr. Sturgeon, it occurs to me that a great deal of science fiction writing is negativistic in a way,

11:41.360 --> 11:49.980
because so many stories deal with utopias and how they fail, that they aren't real utopias.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.200
They're not ideal societies.

11:53.840 --> 11:57.820
I have thought of something, not many people seem to have thought of utopias.

11:58.620 --> 12:02.140
You see, let me go back to something like this.

12:02.220 --> 12:05.340
The cells in your body are different at this moment.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.380
They were when you walked into the studio.

12:07.900 --> 12:12.260
There's a perpetual growth and change within you and with anything that's alive.

12:12.960 --> 12:18.340
And for that matter, the planet that we're on, it started in some coalescing gases

12:18.340 --> 12:20.940
and it's going to end in a bunch of cinders.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.500
And the process between those two has not stopped.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.980
We're sitting on an island of granite, a float on a sea of hot mush,

12:30.500 --> 12:32.840
on a planet which is in motion around its primary.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.900
The sun itself is in motion in the galaxy.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.100
The galaxies are all tumbling around in and amongst each other.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.920
Even the space between is in kind of a turmoil.

12:43.020 --> 12:46.140
If your time scale is large enough, you can see the whole thing boiling.

12:47.340 --> 12:52.560
The only unnatural practice that I can think of, truly unnatural practice,

12:52.700 --> 12:55.920
is to stop for a living thing, to just stop.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.660
And yet there is that about human beings which makes them want to stop.

13:00.860 --> 13:04.580
Now we are where you mentioned utopias.

13:05.560 --> 13:09.440
Virtually without exception, the utopia is a static situation.

13:10.140 --> 13:13.640
You orient yourself toward a goal where everything is all neat

13:13.640 --> 13:15.840
and all the buildings are built around a lake

13:15.840 --> 13:20.820
and they all have ten stories and the people move back and forth

13:20.820 --> 13:22.960
and not smile at each other and love each other a bunch.

13:24.820 --> 13:26.640
But there's no more beyond that.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.860
Maybe internal expansion and I can't knock that.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.400
I mean that the people perhaps are learning more

13:32.400 --> 13:34.520
and experiencing more within themselves.

13:35.260 --> 13:37.460
Nevertheless, virtually all utopias from Plato,

13:39.080 --> 13:44.440
Ronon and I have this quality of being perfected instruments

13:44.440 --> 13:47.600
like pyramids, like the Egyptian pyramids,

13:47.780 --> 13:49.540
finished with a single stone on top.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.900
Well life isn't like that. People aren't like that.

13:53.440 --> 13:58.300
If I were to design a utopia, it would be one of dynamic equilibrium

13:58.300 --> 13:59.140
rather than static.

13:59.440 --> 14:03.160
It would be the kind of equilibrium that a gull has when it flies.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.260
It has to be in motion in order to remain alive.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.380
All life is like that.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.980
Is there a tendency to become pessimistic about the future?

14:12.600 --> 14:18.240
Not as long as we can combat this hunger for stasis

14:18.240 --> 14:21.260
that I think is the human being's greatest disease.

14:22.460 --> 14:23.460
He wants it locked in.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.600
And in spite of what you see in the magazines, diamonds are not forever.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.320
They really are not forever.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.740
Nothing is forever in that sense.

14:31.480 --> 14:35.120
And if you can recognize that and design your life and your politics

14:35.120 --> 14:39.740
and your morality in a sense of ongoing and evolution and growth

14:39.740 --> 14:42.580
and deeper understanding, but always perpetual movement,

14:43.640 --> 14:46.220
then I think you have something like a utopian situation.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.020
But it's a dynamic utopia, you see.

14:50.280 --> 14:54.080
Progress in quotation marks has gotten a bad name

14:55.160 --> 14:56.760
many times in the past.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.500
Mostly from people who don't like the way progress is going.

14:59.500 --> 15:04.200
I mean, there was probably a lot of lip-pulling about coming down out of the trees

15:04.200 --> 15:05.000
or out of the caves.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.660
You know, it's good enough for my grandfather,

15:07.940 --> 15:09.080
and it's good enough for you, kid.

15:11.680 --> 15:15.000
Many people, I suppose they're writers mainly,

15:15.320 --> 15:19.420
are always curious about the habits of another writer

15:19.420 --> 15:25.400
and the possibility of us having writing blocks and how he gets going

15:25.400 --> 15:29.400
and does he have periods of total lethargy and so forth.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.580
Do you have any secrets?

15:32.120 --> 15:34.280
I am the world's greatest expert on writer's blocks.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.600
I had one once that lasted for six years.

15:37.140 --> 15:37.700
Six years.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.760
And you know, when you've got wives and children and then like that,

15:41.420 --> 15:43.400
and the rent's due and so on,

15:43.540 --> 15:46.960
and your income is writing and you dry up for six years,

15:47.100 --> 15:47.660
it's pretty rough.

15:48.620 --> 15:49.180
Very rough.

15:50.680 --> 15:54.460
I think, eventually, to say I can cure virtually anybody's writer's block.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.880
Because it's something that I have involved myself in very profoundly.

15:58.020 --> 15:59.340
I cannot always cure my own.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.920
But I had a profound insight one time.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.880
I had a major breakdown in 1965.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.480
I mean, I really came to be, it was a close thing.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.100
And fortunately, I fell under the hands of somebody who,

16:15.680 --> 16:17.500
well, ideally, he was a Sturgeon fan.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.740
This guy, I swear he'd read more Sturgeon than Sturgeon has written.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.400
He could quote old paragraphs, which is more than I can do.

16:25.680 --> 16:30.180
And he pointed out in that six-year period of the work that I had done before that,

16:30.980 --> 16:33.520
and the work that I had done subsequent to that period.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.600
Because I was, one of the things that was wrong with me,

16:35.700 --> 16:37.620
I was bewailing those six years.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.880
Six years is enough time to get a Pulitzer Prize,

16:40.340 --> 16:42.140
or make a half a million bucks, you know.

16:42.980 --> 16:47.840
And those six years had gone by and everybody was scarred by it and so on.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.860
And I was mourning that fact in these lost years

16:52.860 --> 16:55.100
and that they would never come back and so on.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.920
He pointed out to me that the quality of work that I had done before that

16:58.920 --> 17:02.540
and what was done afterwards, not only the quality but the content.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.500
He said what I'd done before were essentially entertainments.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.680
And nobody's knocking entertainments.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.480
We need them like we need vitamins.

17:10.460 --> 17:15.060
But the stuff that I was doing afterwards was of a totally different sort.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.200
He called them therapy stories.

17:17.360 --> 17:19.740
Well, he was a therapist and that was his particular bias.

17:20.260 --> 17:20.920
But it's true.

17:21.240 --> 17:25.260
Virtually everything that I've written since then has been about people who are sick and get well,

17:25.660 --> 17:29.100
or people who are well and get better at whatever they are.

17:29.300 --> 17:32.060
Obviously, you were growing during that time.

17:32.140 --> 17:33.400
That's the point that he made.

17:33.740 --> 17:36.500
He said you are mourning the fact that the work stopped.

17:36.940 --> 17:38.200
He said the work didn't stop.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.120
The pages stopped coming out.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.100
But he said that's a triviality.

17:42.380 --> 17:43.540
The work continued.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.740
And he said this is documented by the work you've done.

17:47.740 --> 17:49.960
And that was a huge thing for me to find out.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.020
I mean, I'm never going to get depressed about that again.

17:52.500 --> 17:56.240
And if I go through a period where no pages come out for weeks or even months,

17:56.680 --> 17:58.220
I'm not particularly concerned.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.940
I find that when I'm writing, I'm not writing.

18:01.060 --> 18:02.840
I'm typing in some strange way.

18:02.900 --> 18:03.380
It's all done.

18:03.860 --> 18:08.180
And suddenly I'll sit down and type right over 30 hours and type until I fall over sideways.

18:08.980 --> 18:12.340
I've produced a 21,000 word novel, that without getting up from the desk.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.560
But in 18 or 20 hours.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.780
And it's all done.

18:20.180 --> 18:23.860
And oddly enough, the internal structure of the story, the subsidiary plots,

18:24.280 --> 18:30.380
the subsidiary characters themselves, the placing of climax and denouement and so on.

18:30.840 --> 18:31.400
It's all there.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.000
It's all finished.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.540
If you interrupted me in the middle and asked me how is this going to end

18:36.540 --> 18:40.840
and in what way I wouldn't be able to tell you, that's a peculiar internal thing.

18:40.840 --> 18:45.580
Do you turn to other kinds of stories as relief, let's say, from science fiction?

18:46.200 --> 18:54.460
Not as relief, but often another vehicle will say what I want to say better.

18:55.140 --> 18:56.740
And as a result, I've written romances.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.520
I have a book of Western stories.

18:59.900 --> 19:04.320
And they're not like anybody else's Western stories, but they're legitimate Western stories.

19:06.160 --> 19:10.700
And yeah, I've written a great many, well, we're back to the same thing where the addict will say

19:10.700 --> 19:12.740
that Sturgeon does not write real science fiction.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.340
No, essentially I write people's stories.

19:15.620 --> 19:19.180
You've worked in scenarios and for films, have you not?

19:19.220 --> 19:22.540
Yeah, I went out to the West Coast originally 12 years ago to write Star Trek.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.380
I wrote six, I sold four, and I aired two, which is pretty well far from the course.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.760
And those two have been showcased very well.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.080
I mean, they were very successful.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.160
There were many Star Trek addicts out there.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.720
They were Amok Time.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.780
For those who are very familiar with Star Trek, which shows were these?

19:41.160 --> 19:43.400
Yeah, Amok Time was one of them.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.600
The other one was called Shore Leave.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.880
And they've been very successful.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.720
Have you worked in full-length feature films?

19:51.280 --> 19:52.580
Not specifically, no.

19:54.340 --> 19:57.000
One of my stories killed those.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.940
I think one of the best stories I ever wrote.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.180
I mentioned I'd write up for six years.

20:01.180 --> 20:05.260
In the middle of that six-year period, for nine days, I could write.

20:05.660 --> 20:10.200
And I wrote, killed out in, right first draft, exactly where you read it, all the way through.

20:11.740 --> 20:13.280
And then it shot down again.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.120
And it was brought by Universal Pictures.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.600
And they made a movie of the week out of it.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.940
And it is a dog.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.360
It is awful.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.420
I mean, really.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.340
You can't fault the D-9 they used.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.720
The use of caterpillar D-9, which is a marvelous machine.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.120
I've been in love with those big machines for years anyhow.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.720
I'm still a class A heavy equipment operator.

20:33.080 --> 20:38.060
As a person who deals with the imagination, imaginative things,

20:38.840 --> 20:47.540
do you think that this emphasis on the visual, interpreting all of these stories through pictures,

20:47.900 --> 20:52.080
is detrimental to writing of science fiction?

20:52.760 --> 20:53.820
It's hard to say.

20:53.820 --> 20:59.840
There's a man called Byron Price in New York who is getting out a whole line of what they call graphics,

21:00.020 --> 21:04.440
graphic novels, which are as much pictures as they are prose.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.600
And they have something to be said for him.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.600
But I think it's essentially, it's another...

21:10.600 --> 21:11.460
Super comic books, though.

21:11.500 --> 21:11.900
That's right.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.740
But it's another kind of fiction.

21:14.740 --> 21:18.160
I mean, just as there are kinds of music, there's chamber music, and there's symphonic music,

21:18.300 --> 21:19.600
and there's rock in this country.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.820
And so on.

21:21.160 --> 21:26.020
And each conveys to its audience what its audience really wants.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.120
And so I don't knock it.

21:28.260 --> 21:33.680
I am afraid that people are going to stop reading, which is an interesting thing.

21:34.420 --> 21:37.480
You know, back in the 15th and 16th century, if a guy worked on shoes,

21:37.620 --> 21:39.420
he put a big boot up over his store.

21:40.140 --> 21:45.140
And if a guy sold horses, he put a big horse up over his store, because people couldn't read.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.280
Well, you know we're getting back to that.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.260
It's not only watching television all the time.

21:49.620 --> 21:52.920
But the international signs, and now you've got a sign for the ladies room,

21:52.980 --> 21:58.320
and you've got a sign for the telephone, and you've got a sign for the baggage pickup, and so on.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.000
All these little pictographs.

22:00.720 --> 22:05.040
And pretty soon we're just going to be watching the tube and looking at pictographs.

22:05.300 --> 22:08.960
And what price really fine finished prose?

22:09.820 --> 22:13.560
In spite of the fact that the gimmickry is superior,

22:13.560 --> 22:19.340
do you think we've gone downhill from Star Trek to Battlestar Galactica?

22:19.900 --> 22:24.460
Battlestar Galactica suffers primarily from the ripoff.

22:24.600 --> 22:31.540
I mean they take things that are guaranteed successes and redo them in the Galactica format.

22:32.420 --> 22:40.480
For example, Jane and I saw Shane on Battlestar Galactica, virtually down the line.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.200
And this is what they do.

22:44.560 --> 22:48.540
Whatever has been successful, and they put it in the science fiction format and it works.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.500
Star Trek was its own, highly original thing.

22:54.520 --> 22:59.720
The success of Star Trek, the mobiles, people try to imitate it and fail.

23:00.540 --> 23:05.800
The main reason they fail is that Star Trek was started and promoted and still is.

23:06.300 --> 23:08.260
By a man who had ideals.

23:09.000 --> 23:09.620
He really did.

23:09.620 --> 23:13.840
Gene Roddenberry believes in such things as patriotism,

23:14.100 --> 23:19.980
an American democratic ideal, and the equality of the sexes and the equality of the races.

23:20.480 --> 23:24.080
He believes in these things very deeply, his own personal belief.

23:24.860 --> 23:29.860
And in every episode of Star Trek he exploited and expressed these beliefs.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.780
And that's really what reached people.

23:33.660 --> 23:37.240
It wasn't so much Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock's point of dearest and so on.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.180
It was the underlying faith that the man had in his own ideals.

23:40.900 --> 23:47.600
A lot of people who say that that's corny and ho-hum and hooray, let's wrap ourselves in the American flag.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.940
It isn't that, it goes very much deeper than that.

23:50.340 --> 23:52.320
People really do want something to believe in.

23:53.280 --> 23:58.100
Space 1999 and even Galactica don't really seem to give much of a damn about anything,

23:58.360 --> 24:00.580
except getting this show on the air next season.

24:01.820 --> 24:08.080
But Gene Roddenberry believed very profoundly in these things, using Star Trek to express them.

24:08.700 --> 24:16.300
From the visual to other art forms, I know you are an appreciator of music.

24:17.000 --> 24:23.500
Do you sometimes feel that or wish that you were a composer rather than a writer?

24:23.720 --> 24:28.620
Could you express some of your ideas better in some other form, either as a composer or artist?

24:28.620 --> 24:31.740
There are things that you can say in music that you can't say in words.

24:34.740 --> 24:37.920
I am suddenly thought of Giancarlo Minotti, who wrote the medium.

24:38.840 --> 24:44.480
Somebody wrote him once as a triple threat artist.

24:44.860 --> 24:48.280
He was a director and he was a composer and he was a librettist.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.740
And he said, oh no, not triple, double.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.940
And the interviewer said, when do you mean double?

24:54.100 --> 24:57.840
He said, well, yes, I'm a director, but he said as far as the rest of it,

24:57.840 --> 25:00.000
the words come to me encased in music.

25:01.380 --> 25:03.060
To him, they were all the same thing.

25:04.120 --> 25:06.420
Which is a very interesting way of expressing it.

25:06.820 --> 25:13.560
But sometimes music alone, there is a guitar etude by Fernando Sor,

25:13.980 --> 25:17.800
which someday I am going to write lyrics to, but it just absolutely takes me apart to listen to.

25:18.200 --> 25:23.840
I think the greatest piece of music I have ever composed is the Pasecagli in Fugue,

25:23.840 --> 25:24.920
which is a piece by Bach.

25:26.020 --> 25:28.800
It is architectured in such an extraordinary way.

25:31.300 --> 25:35.980
It establishes a fifteen note theme and repeats it over and over again.

25:36.320 --> 25:39.840
But we are rephrasing it and throwing it to various parts of the orchestra,

25:40.640 --> 25:43.300
whether he composed it before an orchestra or not, beside the point.

25:44.300 --> 25:47.540
And winding up with a monumental discord,

25:47.540 --> 25:54.360
everything is huge, it is a great crashing, 115 piece chord that leans over sideways,

25:54.540 --> 25:55.600
is about to fall over.

25:56.340 --> 26:00.920
Then he backs off and he gives it to you in C major, having written in C minor the whole time.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.820
And you just go away feeling good.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.940
And I don't know how you do that in prose, I really don't.

26:06.980 --> 26:11.020
You have a new collection of stories that is just out.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.000
Yes, it is called Visions and Visionaries.

26:13.000 --> 26:13.740
It is from Dell.

26:14.440 --> 26:20.800
It is the first of five books that Dell is getting out within the next year, 18 months.

26:21.420 --> 26:23.640
Are most of these short story collections?

26:23.740 --> 26:24.780
No, two of them are novels.

26:25.060 --> 26:25.800
Two of them are full novels.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.020
The rest of the three are collections.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.900
Do you find it more difficult to write a full length work than a short story?

26:30.480 --> 26:33.540
It depends on the idea that is pushing you.

26:34.820 --> 26:41.000
Often you will start to write a short story and it expands itself into a novel,

26:41.000 --> 26:42.540
or even into a novel.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.960
That is interesting how that happens too.

26:45.260 --> 26:49.100
Often you get a very powerful idea and it plunges you right into it.

26:49.640 --> 26:54.360
And you keep working it and working it until ultimately you find that it needs to be cut.

26:54.540 --> 26:57.480
And what you cut is the original idea that started the whole thing,

26:57.900 --> 27:00.840
because it is taking the bit in its teeth and run off in another direction.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.000
Mr. Sturgeon, it has been delightful talking with you.

27:05.220 --> 27:06.540
Thank you so much for joining us today.

27:06.540 --> 27:08.240
Thank you, and it has been a pleasure to talk to you.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.160
You ask some fine questions, you really do.

27:10.160 --> 27:10.800
Thank you.
