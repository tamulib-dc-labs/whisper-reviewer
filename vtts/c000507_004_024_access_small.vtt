Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.580 --> 00:33.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.300
And here are your hosts.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.340
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.600 --> 00:50.680
Science Fiction Chronicle is a major science fiction and fantasy news magazine distributed by Algal Press, which appears monthly.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.500
It's publisher is Andrew Porter, who for most of his life has been a science fiction fan.

00:54.760 --> 00:58.700
Porter told us how he discovered science fiction. It's a story familiar to most of us.

00:59.280 --> 01:06.480
My brother was reading SF first. He's five years older than I am. So when he was 15, I was 10. I just started picking it up from him.

01:08.080 --> 01:16.320
And he still reads SF, but obviously I have gone much further, much deeper into the subject than he would have ever dreamed of.

01:17.040 --> 01:23.600
Porter went on to produce several fan publications, and he started Algal Magazine. Algal was later named Starship, which is still a viable magazine.

01:23.600 --> 01:29.840
Porter founded Algal Press when his ambitions grew. Science Fiction Chronicle is another one of the productions of Algal Press.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.660
We asked him who else is involved in running Algal Press.

01:33.620 --> 01:43.240
When I started, I wanted to start publishing like chapbooks and books and stuff like that. I adopted the name Algal Press from Algal Magazine.

01:43.720 --> 01:53.720
But it's not really, it's just sort of like the name of my press. And if I do chapbooks or books or something, I mean I did one book, really.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.620
I did the book of Ellison, which is a real hardcover and a trade paperback.

01:59.820 --> 02:07.160
But people think I work for this vast Algal Press. And of course also the appearance of Starship and Chronicle, like, wow, typesetting.

02:07.160 --> 02:13.720
Starship has or at least had four cover covers. Well, he's got this vast organization behind him. He's not a fan at all, they say.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.780
It's just on me, pasting stuff up my living room.

02:25.920 --> 02:32.180
After having published several fan zines, Porter started Science Fiction Chronicle. It was the magazine he had always dreamed of doing.

02:33.420 --> 02:40.440
So for years, I carried on my business card. You have a business card and it prices people and costs five bucks or five thousand.

02:41.600 --> 02:48.320
I had a thing called SF Chronicle listed in there, you know, which was just a title. And it was like the Newsy Niles wanted to do it.

02:48.320 --> 03:00.320
Finally in 1979, I started as a news section in Algal, which at that time had become Starship by then changed the title, a more hardcore SF title.

03:03.320 --> 03:12.980
And it started out with, you know, getting subscriptions. So in other words, I actually started it with several hundred subscriptions.

03:14.020 --> 03:20.160
And it was just a thing then the way I want to do it, like typesetting, nicely laid out, stuff like that.

03:20.660 --> 03:25.960
Science Fiction Chronicle just had its fourth birthday. It's a rarity for a Science Fiction news magazine to have survived for so long.

03:27.040 --> 03:33.600
Through the years, various people started up news zines. They've all folded. They've all gone away. They've all stopped publishing.

03:33.760 --> 03:41.280
People got tired or they got tired of losing money or something. And it didn't. It's still here. It's doing pretty well. I mean, it's not.

03:43.780 --> 03:54.000
I don't think it's making money yet, but it's at the break-even point, which is always nice. Advertising is increasing and now the recession is ending.

03:54.580 --> 03:55.620
Things are starting to take off.

03:56.480 --> 04:02.880
Why would a fan devote his life to producing a news magazine such as Science Fiction Chronicle, especially since it doesn't net him much profit?

04:03.340 --> 04:04.500
Porter told us his reasons.

04:05.500 --> 04:12.240
I've always loved Science Fiction. I mean, I could probably make a lot more money publishing a magazine with a lot of naked people in it, right?

04:12.960 --> 04:20.460
Or, you know, or something, motorcycles or, you know, Hell's Angels official newsletters and something like that.

04:21.040 --> 04:29.180
You know, if you don't buy this newsletter, it will kill you. One of those things. I don't know. But I just love Science Fiction. I've always loved Science Fiction.

04:29.340 --> 04:33.040
And I can make my living doing something in Science Fiction. That's great.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.560
Porter also gets a kick out of producing Science Fiction Chronicle.

04:37.820 --> 04:45.520
The kick really is getting up when I feel like it. Working until when I feel like it. And not having a boss to yell at me and say, you screwed up.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.760
And I screwed up and you're going to take the blame because I'm your boss.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.700
We'll have more on our next show with publisher Andrew Porter.

05:12.140 --> 05:13.540
What?

05:54.780 --> 05:58.780
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show. So stay with us.

06:14.620 --> 06:19.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show. A commentary on Science Fiction and fantasy.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.140
And here are your hosts.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.140
This is Daryl Lane.

06:29.220 --> 06:29.800
And Bill Vernon.

06:30.260 --> 06:37.240
Algal Press is a one-man operation which publishes the magazine Starship, an occasional book, and the monthly trade newspaper, Science Fiction Chronicle.

06:37.580 --> 06:41.780
Andrew Porter of Brooklyn is the one-man operator. He handles all aspects of the business.

06:42.060 --> 06:45.620
From subscriptions to advertising, from editorializing to arranging the printing.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.380
Recently we spoke with Porter and we asked him to describe a typical work day.

06:50.060 --> 06:53.760
I get up anywhere from about 10.30 to 11.30.

06:56.200 --> 07:09.280
And put around and I'll do stuff in the morning like entering financial stuff or getting checks ready for deposit.

07:09.600 --> 07:16.500
And so I go into midtown and I hit a whole bunch of stuff and one stop on the subway.

07:17.440 --> 07:24.320
There's my commercial bank for my accounts, Starship and SF Chronicles stuff.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.640
And then two doors away there's my personal savings bank.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.600
Across the street is the New York office of the printer I use.

07:32.760 --> 07:38.780
And I can go in there and use their tie line to co-op the printer out in Pennsylvania and find out what that's doing.

07:39.620 --> 07:44.060
Or I can deliver stuff that has to be, you know, they have a power system overnight.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.980
There's a stationary store near there I use and my post office box is up there in Grand Central Station.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.100
And the place where I have pictures developed.

07:56.100 --> 08:03.280
And all that and you know, then I come back home and I'll do other stuff at night.

08:03.620 --> 08:06.460
I like to work late at night, very quiet.

08:07.340 --> 08:16.280
I have a TV going in the background and I watch Johnny Carson and then David Letterman comes on.

08:16.760 --> 08:24.480
And then after that there's a very good news program called News Overnight at NBC, which has very tongue-in-cheek.

08:24.860 --> 08:27.820
They do not ready for primetime news and other strange things.

08:28.740 --> 08:34.420
And then if I'm really working straight through there's two issues, two episodes of Mary Tyler Moore come on.

08:35.300 --> 08:42.920
I followed by an episode of Bob Newhart and by that time it's four in the morning and then I love Lucy Rerun comes around.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.460
Usually I can't stand that and all so I just turn off the speaker.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.420
Or else knock off the door earlier and then read.

08:49.260 --> 08:53.240
The April 1983 issue of Science Fiction Chronicle had some startling headlines.

08:53.740 --> 08:55.900
Cherry, Spinred, To-Wed collaborate.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.140
The doll pays $50 million for New American Library.

08:59.620 --> 09:02.560
The New England Science Fiction Association acquires Sherrith in Boston.

09:02.560 --> 09:07.340
These turned out to be fictitious. They were an April Fools joke. Porter told us about it.

09:08.040 --> 09:14.420
I asked people's permission to do that. I asked Don Warren's permission to do that story.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.040
And I asked Cherry's permission and I asked Spinred.

09:17.260 --> 09:23.900
And I arranged this sort of a matchmaker thing and saying, well, who would you like to get married to?

09:24.880 --> 09:27.940
And Sherrith didn't mind Spinred and Spinred didn't mind Sherrith.

09:28.420 --> 09:33.140
And I ran those stories and a heck of a lot of people believe those stories.

09:33.320 --> 09:38.460
I understand that various writers were calling other writers out to read and there's issues over the phone and stuff.

09:39.360 --> 09:43.000
And people who knew Spinred and knew he was planning to move out in the air said,

09:43.080 --> 09:46.660
you slide down and you're going to move to Oklahoma, not Los Angeles.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.900
And if it's set in tight, people believe it.

09:52.900 --> 09:58.660
Porter promised there will be a special treat to appear in the April of 1984 issue of Science Fiction Chronicle.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.420
For next April, I have two ideas I'm going to use.

10:02.840 --> 10:10.840
And this one was kind of funny and humorous, like the thing with the New England Science Fiction Association buying the Sherrith in Boston.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.680
And I have two ideas I'm going to use.

10:16.680 --> 10:22.160
One is going to be either, I won't tell you what they are, the specific ideas,

10:22.360 --> 10:27.020
but one will either be kind of interesting and humorous, or the other, it might be horrifying.

10:27.600 --> 10:33.600
And I think we'll hear the hell out of a lot of people and it won't be humorous, but it's going to be possible.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.940
It's going to be a possible story, but it's going to scare a lot of people.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.420
And I think it might anger a lot of people too, but it'll be a hope.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.100
More with Andrew Porter on our next show.

10:51.600 --> 10:57.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

10:57.400 --> 11:00.300
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.080
Thank you.

11:45.820 --> 11:49.940
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:50.740 --> 11:53.440
Stay with us.

12:05.140 --> 12:10.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.200
And here are your hosts.

12:19.420 --> 12:21.400
This is Ernest and Daryl Lane.

12:21.620 --> 12:24.420
There are several professional science fiction magazines still in operation.

12:24.820 --> 12:29.700
Amazing stories, analog, azimuth science fiction, and fantasy and science fiction are the present day survivors.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.040
Scores of professional magazines have come and gone over the past 60 years.

12:33.340 --> 12:37.460
There's a niche in science fiction though, which is filled by a handful of magazines published sporadically.

12:37.700 --> 12:42.820
Like the professional monthly magazine, these semi-prozines, combined stories, articles, and interviews.

12:42.820 --> 12:46.880
One such magazine is Starship, subtitled The Magazine About Science Fiction.

12:47.360 --> 12:53.220
We talked recently with Starship's publisher, Andrew Porter of AlGol Press, who also produces a news magazine, Science Fiction Chronicles.

12:53.740 --> 12:57.080
Porter told us that running such a magazine is certainly affected by the state of the economy.

12:59.000 --> 13:07.820
Starship went from a reggware in 1972, went to twice a year, and then in 1974, I think, went to three times a year.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.500
Maybe you don't like it or not. In 1977-78, it went to quarterly.

13:13.920 --> 13:19.920
And then when the recession hit, I considered the whole, these last quote, two, one quote,

13:20.040 --> 13:23.760
recessions we've had, and one big recession.

13:24.560 --> 13:29.920
And then what happened to Starship happened across the field, or just across publishing period,

13:30.960 --> 13:41.800
within the period of an issue or so, bookstore sales dropped by half the people just decided, you know,

13:41.860 --> 13:46.300
it was more important to save their money or buy food or something like that.

13:47.220 --> 13:50.240
And advertising dropped off a lot too.

13:50.240 --> 13:58.400
And the best thing that happened was 1979 had one issue with 40 pages of advertising, with 90-some-out pages.

14:00.180 --> 14:05.020
And that just dropped tremendously during the recession, all of this stuff dried up.

14:05.560 --> 14:11.100
And it reached the point instead of making a small profit, it was making a small loss.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.960
So the more issues I published, the more money it would make. So what was the point?

14:14.960 --> 14:19.380
So basically, in the spending publications for the funding over a year.

14:20.240 --> 14:25.300
In order for Starship to survive, Porter finds that he must constantly seek ways to lower production costs.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.100
Here he tells us of one story.

14:28.520 --> 14:39.480
The weird thing about Starship is, chronicle, I write most of it, and obviously I'm not paying myself for writing all his stuff.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.720
Starship is all stuff where you have to pay for it, stuff of letters in the editorial.

14:45.840 --> 14:59.800
The printing costs are much higher than chronicles because you've got four-color cover, a chrome coat, the print run at larger, the overall magazine.

15:01.180 --> 15:05.020
Mailing costs are higher. It weighs more.

15:09.400 --> 15:13.280
So what I did the last issue, I went from a four-color cover to a two-color cover.

15:13.980 --> 15:18.460
And I think it looks good. It doesn't look like. I've seen other people do two-color and they do well.

15:18.880 --> 15:23.680
The artwork is in blue and then the pipe is in black. So I'm using it like that.

15:25.140 --> 15:35.940
So not having a four-color cover, I saved about $300 in cost of color separation and another $4, $500 in the printing.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.960
Porter told us it's still another tactic for saving on the cost of production.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.140
Remember, these strategies allow him to continue producing Starship.

15:44.040 --> 15:53.320
This new issue, I'm not going to have a cover. It's going to be a self-cover, but it's going to be the outside form for the printing that's going to be two-color.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.340
So it'll have an effect of two-color cover.

15:58.220 --> 16:03.060
But not having that cover and just printing it on the run.

16:03.260 --> 16:06.720
Actually, what I might do is I might run the outside form on slick paper.

16:07.580 --> 16:12.760
So it'll be like eight pages of slick paper in the front, eight pages in the back, and then I'll encode the rest of it.

16:13.420 --> 16:18.360
And that'll save the cost of having a Chrome-core cover and stuff. That'll save $900.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.480
And how many copies you have to sell to make that $900?

16:24.700 --> 16:28.200
So, and also it's gone twice a year now.

16:31.840 --> 16:37.180
And it's basically the difference between doing something that'll make a small profit and something that'll lose.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.480
And you can't probably something that can lose money.

16:46.940 --> 16:49.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show.

16:49.760 --> 16:55.520
Production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:45.060 --> 17:45.560
The

17:45.560 --> 17:47.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.060
So stay with us.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.060
A commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.480
And here are your hosts.

18:18.580 --> 18:19.640
This is Daryl Lane.

18:19.740 --> 18:20.340
And Bill Vernon.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.780
Art of Mayhemar hit the fantasy scene in 1979 with several novels.

18:24.020 --> 18:28.180
Since Mayhemar has a self-admitted pinch-it for using at least one unpronounceable word in each of his novels,

18:28.180 --> 18:31.880
each title will in her tell you what she's written in the fantasy and science fiction genres.

18:32.360 --> 18:38.660
In 1979, Double Day published How the Gods Wove in Kiranak.

18:39.260 --> 18:43.240
In 80's, Double Day brought out The Seekers of Saranand.

18:43.560 --> 18:49.540
81 brought the soul singer of Pyrrnot from Atheneum.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.800
82 busted loose like a pot of popcorn.

18:57.720 --> 19:02.060
Warlock F. came from Double Day in the spring.

19:04.820 --> 19:10.740
Paperback reprints from Ace of How the Gods Wove in Seekers of Saranand came out that spring.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.040
Breeze of the Liar came out from Atheneum that fall.

19:20.740 --> 19:24.740
And Golden Dream of Ozzy Odyssey came out that fall.

19:25.780 --> 19:31.940
So it sort of just grabbed you up like a tornado and carried you away spinning.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.220
We asked Mayhemar what type of fantasy she writes.

19:35.900 --> 19:39.060
It is really more toward heroic fantasy.

19:40.020 --> 19:44.000
Though not in the disorders and sorceries type of thing.

19:44.220 --> 19:52.940
These are more people who are heroic, not through physical strength or anything like that,

19:52.940 --> 19:55.580
but because of the present circumstance and integrity.

19:57.040 --> 20:06.140
I try to write about the way people can be and often are in real illness and in spas.

20:06.140 --> 20:07.900
There is a place for that.

20:08.620 --> 20:16.100
But I have never seen that the cause of human enlightenment has been forwarded too much

20:16.100 --> 20:20.900
by depicting the absolute worst aspects of human nature.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.860
People can be noble, they can be courageous.

20:25.800 --> 20:29.360
And they very often are so why not write about it?

20:31.000 --> 20:35.380
Since she is a poet as well, we asked Mayhemar if writing poetry helps her write prose.

20:37.100 --> 20:44.820
I talk to a lot of college classes and I belong to a group that has beginners in it.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.660
And I tell them, like poetry even is bad poetry.

20:49.140 --> 20:53.880
Because in poetry you don't have a novel worth of elbow room.

20:53.880 --> 21:04.160
You can't use 25 wrong words to get across an idea that two perfect words will give with puth, with real impact.

21:06.720 --> 21:09.540
Poetry takes the laziness out of it.

21:09.640 --> 21:17.580
It makes you search for the proper words, the proper phrases, exact construction that conveys what you want to give.

21:18.580 --> 21:21.520
Mayhemar published her first novel after her children at home.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.140
We asked her if she ever wishes she had gotten published earlier.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.240
You know, I had given that a lot of thought.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.920
It's a very rough road of hope.

21:32.240 --> 21:37.820
But I have come to the conclusion that people have a great deal to say it, they're young.

21:38.600 --> 21:49.800
Quite often don't keep pushing themselves to refine their technique, get better and better and better so that by golly you are so good they can't turn you down.

21:50.680 --> 21:58.560
Besides which, you know, when you live for years, you know a lot of things you didn't know when you lived 25 years.

22:00.020 --> 22:10.820
You understand not only what people do, but how they feel under different circumstances when a husband comes home and he's lost his job.

22:11.400 --> 22:15.340
You not only know how he acts, you know how he and his wife feel about it.

22:15.340 --> 22:24.040
And this is something that I think tells you the great deal of modern non-genre fiction to be superficial.

22:24.780 --> 22:35.560
People are writing about it who has never stood in those views and who don't really understand what it does to your gut to have a child that's definitely only two o'clock in the morning.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.680
You know, all these sort of things.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.340
We'll have more with Ardeth Mayhemar on her next show.

22:47.680 --> 22:56.340
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:45.920 --> 23:50.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:05.940 --> 24:11.320
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.680
And here are your hosts.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.800
This is Bill Vernon and Darrell Ang.

24:21.980 --> 24:26.320
Ardeth Mayhemar is a nice Texas writer who recently began publishing in a variety of genres.

24:26.720 --> 24:29.280
She has written several fantasy novels and one science fiction novel.

24:29.500 --> 24:32.800
That being a continuation of the Fuzzy series started by the late H.B. Piper.

24:33.260 --> 24:37.040
Mayhemar's contribution to that series is entitled Golden Dream, a fuzzy odyssey.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.080
Mayhemar has written some westerns and she's working in other genres.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.740
She manages to write a lot because she works so rapidly.

24:43.180 --> 24:46.660
This is amazing because she lives on a farm and she has a lot of chores to do each day.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.880
We ask Mayhemar to describe a typical day.

24:49.640 --> 24:53.800
My husband and I get up at six. He has to go to town and open up his service space.

24:53.980 --> 24:56.140
So I get up and fix breakfast for him at six.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.720
And at eight fifteen comes the Postman.

24:59.720 --> 25:04.300
So I'm standing there, I'm washing dishes, or I'm out there milking the cows.

25:05.020 --> 25:06.760
And I'm listening for the Postman.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.500
You know when Snoopy is a vulture when he's on top of his doghouse being a vulture?

25:11.900 --> 25:13.820
That's the way I am with the Postman.

25:16.260 --> 25:23.240
I milk one of the cows and turn the five calves in on her and her partner.

25:23.860 --> 25:27.360
And ten feed the goats and feed the cats and feed the dogs.

25:27.360 --> 25:31.200
And then I get the mail and look through.

25:31.940 --> 25:33.480
And I get this interesting mail.

25:33.700 --> 25:37.080
A lot of days I begin my real work.

25:37.380 --> 25:43.960
Of course in among this I usually try to sweep the porch and straighten the stacks.

25:44.140 --> 25:47.620
I've discovered you don't have to clean your living room if you keep your stacks straight.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.820
So I straighten the stacks.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.500
Then I hit the time fryer about nine o'clock usually.

25:54.500 --> 25:58.560
And I may answer six letters before I start writing with them.

25:59.260 --> 26:07.100
I would usually write depending on what I am engaged in from three to seven hours.

26:08.280 --> 26:15.040
I can write a pretty fair size short story in two and a half, three hours.

26:15.460 --> 26:18.980
But if I'm working on a book, then it's really hot.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.040
Well I'll go right on through the three thirty four o'clock sometimes.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.460
And I'm one of these lucky people.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.340
I don't have to eat. I don't need to eat.

26:26.660 --> 26:27.500
So I don't get hugged.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.200
Don't have to interrupt myself.

26:32.520 --> 26:38.100
And about three thirty or four of the goats start yelling at the pen.

26:38.380 --> 26:40.980
I don't know why she yells at four o'clock.

26:41.280 --> 26:49.080
But she usually does and that wakes me up and I think, you know, I don't know whether I can get my own bones up from here or not.

26:49.080 --> 26:53.900
I'd better try and see, you know, among much creaking and groaning.

26:54.180 --> 27:00.320
I'm hoist myself off the stool and straighten out and untrink the back.

27:00.580 --> 27:10.340
And so that's then when I go out and oh I may dig in my garden or take a walk up our little road.

27:10.340 --> 27:20.780
But time to get back is time to lick the cat all over again and milk the cows and put the calves on the feet of the goats and all that good stuff.

27:20.980 --> 27:25.760
And then it's time to go supper up a papa and he gets home about six thirty.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.540
And so we're pretty well ready to pack it in.

27:37.140 --> 27:39.940
So Mayhars Farm Chores take up a great deal of her day.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.080
We wondered if she might be more productive if she were to live in the city.

27:43.940 --> 27:46.520
I am a peasant tonight, a toenate.

27:48.780 --> 27:50.080
I am not happy.

27:50.220 --> 27:55.960
I have lived in town periodically and have been miserable every minute.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.520
Oh I had to live in Houston for sixteen months.

27:58.700 --> 27:59.700
I thought I'd die.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.540
In fact I think I would have died if we hadn't left.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.660
We've always had a little slot of ground.

28:08.880 --> 28:11.080
Maybe not for two acres, but something.

28:11.340 --> 28:12.980
We've always had some kind of livestock.

28:14.200 --> 28:24.000
When spring comes, if I can't get my hands at the dirt and make a garden, you just better buy a straight jacket and call the men in the white coats because I'm ready to go off.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.060
I do my best writing, thinking in the garden, or even milking the cow.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.780
The old head just keeps rolling right along.

28:41.600 --> 28:50.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
