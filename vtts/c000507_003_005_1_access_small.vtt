00:01.500 --> 00:03.680
Okay, the tapes were on.

00:04.340 --> 00:08.000
Mark, could you give me a little bit of your background, how you grew up,

00:08.140 --> 00:11.980
and maybe how you got interested in writing, and what kind of

00:11.980 --> 00:15.620
science backgrounds you might have had that might have pointed you towards science fiction eventually?

00:16.400 --> 00:20.420
Sure. I was born in 1946 in New Jersey,

00:21.220 --> 00:23.720
and grew up in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia.

00:24.860 --> 00:28.000
I'd say that probably my interest in the literary

00:28.000 --> 00:32.360
matters got started when I was in

00:32.360 --> 00:36.000
grade school, junior high school, my mother was a college level English teacher,

00:36.240 --> 00:39.740
taught at Penn State, I believe the University of Georgia.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.300
So I pretty much had

00:44.300 --> 00:48.060
a lot of books around at all times, and was encouraged to direct my

00:48.060 --> 00:49.680
interest in that direction.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.880
As far as starting writing goes, that was

00:56.940 --> 00:59.300
almost seemed to be the thing to do.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.820
When I was in grade school and began writing

01:03.820 --> 01:08.180
short stories, it was a good play and release for

01:08.180 --> 01:11.540
imagination, and I certainly enjoyed it, and

01:11.540 --> 01:15.240
the editors didn't share my enthusiasm, however, and I

01:15.880 --> 01:20.020
have had not entirely a lot of success in short stories, and that effect the only one

01:20.020 --> 01:24.280
I've ever published was Soul, when I finally got out here to Idaho

01:24.280 --> 01:27.340
in any event, I wrote

01:28.920 --> 01:32.400
Amateur Status as a hobby of ultra junior high and high school,

01:33.300 --> 01:37.160
and then when I got into college, I was very fortunate to go to a place called

01:37.160 --> 01:40.280
Kenyon College in Ohio, which

01:40.280 --> 01:42.920
has really quite a history.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.360
My area of study has always been

01:48.360 --> 01:52.440
the liberal arts, the sciences I'm frankly trying to be much too

01:52.440 --> 01:55.240
challenging and much too much work.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.980
What I do as a science fiction only in the sense that it's

01:59.980 --> 02:03.060
I'd say more fantasy than science fiction.

02:03.820 --> 02:07.720
I don't really have that much of a grasp of hard science, not both

02:07.720 --> 02:10.920
but I certainly appreciate the aesthetics of it,

02:12.020 --> 02:16.040
and that figures in, I take a great deal in the four novels

02:16.040 --> 02:19.140
of the effort. I was very fortunate

02:20.080 --> 02:22.340
at Kenyon because I finally decided that

02:22.340 --> 02:26.700
this was not going to sell short stories, and in my sophomore year began my first novel

02:27.640 --> 02:29.940
which was sold at the end of my junior year,

02:30.580 --> 02:34.940
and came out with paperbacks,

02:35.440 --> 02:38.980
words of starship in the fall of 1967

02:41.500 --> 02:42.540
that apparently

02:42.940 --> 02:46.360
survived in the marketplace, since being reprinted

02:48.200 --> 02:49.680
in England, Holland,

02:50.240 --> 02:54.400
not Holland, I'm sorry, England, France, Italy, and Germany.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.220
I've had the others.

02:58.900 --> 03:02.480
And I wrote another one my senior year in college.

03:03.900 --> 03:07.220
One of the Kenyon Review Prize for Achievement in Fiction, I think primarily

03:07.220 --> 03:10.340
because it was the only college student writing novel that everybody else was pulling around

03:10.340 --> 03:11.400
with poetry and short stories.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.580
I won a scholarship

03:16.480 --> 03:18.420
to the New York University Law School,

03:19.340 --> 03:23.160
a Root-Hilton scholarship, and that fact was free, pretty much determined

03:23.160 --> 03:27.600
my career choice, and because at no time was I under the illusion

03:27.600 --> 03:30.280
that gainful living could be

03:31.360 --> 03:34.780
gotten from pursuing writing. Now that's maybe either a very

03:35.400 --> 03:39.340
good, cold, rational judgment on my part, or pure cowardice

03:40.700 --> 03:42.560
in any event, I did go to New York,

03:43.360 --> 03:46.420
went through law school, wrote a third novel,

03:47.180 --> 03:50.540
the shortest one, The Days Tars There, and

03:51.840 --> 03:53.000
while I was there

03:55.060 --> 03:59.160
spent the summer of my second year with the legal department of Boise Cascade Corporation

03:59.160 --> 04:02.160
out here in Boise, met the law firm that I

04:03.420 --> 04:06.400
joined after getting out of law school, and I've been with ever since.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.080
Since coming out to Boise, I

04:11.820 --> 04:13.520
wrote just one other novel,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.240
that short story I mentioned, but one other novel, The Siege of Wonder, and that was published by

04:18.240 --> 04:21.840
Double Day in 1976, and then I think by

04:22.380 --> 04:25.100
DAW in paperback the next year, and

04:26.720 --> 04:28.560
that I think is the best so far.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.180
After that was published, I became married

04:34.180 --> 04:37.040
to a very wonderful woman, Marika,

04:38.060 --> 04:41.000
who already had two very wonderful children when I met her,

04:44.140 --> 04:45.640
and that has

04:46.080 --> 04:48.720
taken on some immediate responsibility.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.480
Also, it's become a partner in the law firm, and

04:53.560 --> 04:58.120
I've seen how everybody's, well not everybody, take that back. A lot of people expect you to be fairly

04:58.120 --> 05:02.060
grown up, fairly grown up, use the people don't like science, it doesn't

05:02.060 --> 05:05.860
mean that people don't like science fiction or reading or writing, but they do expect

05:05.860 --> 05:09.980
to pay a little more attention to the job at hand than speculating over your own personal

05:09.980 --> 05:13.880
fantasies. Anyway, for whatever reason there is, already has

05:13.880 --> 05:17.780
kind of gotten lost in the

05:17.780 --> 05:20.300
early burleys of work, and

05:20.300 --> 05:26.020
since that time I'm really embarrassed to say that I have not completed anything of any substance.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.700
The hope is still there,

05:29.700 --> 05:33.380
and I have what I believe to be,

05:33.500 --> 05:37.560
I hope will be a viable idea for another novel, and I've been

05:37.560 --> 05:39.460
pitching at it now for some time,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.400
and can speak with as much a matter of trying to find a new focus,

05:45.520 --> 05:49.700
because I believe that a lot of what I've

05:49.700 --> 05:53.140
already written was threatening to become repetitious

05:54.080 --> 05:57.160
and self-clichÃ©, and

05:57.160 --> 06:00.780
also just trying to do some new things. So that

06:01.300 --> 06:05.140
makes it perhaps a doubly difficult to get

06:05.140 --> 06:09.240
started, and to stick with it, maintain the mood, well I guess first of all I have to find the

06:09.240 --> 06:12.540
new mood before I can maintain it. And that's where it stands right now.

06:15.100 --> 06:15.580
Okay,

06:16.380 --> 06:19.820
I was laughing whenever you were talking about growing up.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.760
I'm two years younger than you, and

06:24.760 --> 06:28.480
I too have a real life job, and I don't know what it means,

06:28.700 --> 06:32.860
have to appear to be grown up anyway. What I want to do now

06:32.860 --> 06:36.440
is go back over the individual works, and

06:37.160 --> 06:40.800
see what we can dig out, the things that were interesting to discuss,

06:41.020 --> 06:42.620
and I need to turn an amplifier down.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.800
Okay, now I can hear much better. You allow that

06:48.800 --> 06:51.620
you had been writing since a fairly early age

06:52.440 --> 06:55.480
in grade school, in fact, and yet

06:55.480 --> 06:59.220
science never did, or it interested you, but not the nuts and bolts.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.320
When you did start writing, why was it science fiction and not

07:03.320 --> 07:07.340
historical fiction or mainstream novels or something else?

07:07.440 --> 07:11.660
What was the attraction of science fantasy, I guess is probably what you really write.

07:12.080 --> 07:15.620
Great, well I guess the sheer wonder of it, first of all, for an

07:15.620 --> 07:19.700
adolescent imagination, it was a very easy one to slip into.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.980
An easy

07:23.900 --> 07:27.380
genre to slip into. It did not require you to

07:27.380 --> 07:30.800
embarrass yourself particularly much by trying to do things that

07:31.530 --> 07:35.020
you had no idea how they functioned, writing about them,

07:35.780 --> 07:39.340
like girls. It provided

07:40.280 --> 07:44.040
a great deal of play, because you could allow

07:44.040 --> 07:48.120
your imagination to free reign. So I guess it was kind of self-indulgent in that sense.

07:48.900 --> 07:52.160
And that's the way that my imagination seems to work.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.540
It took a very peculiar, I thought,

07:56.100 --> 07:58.620
an individualized perspective

07:59.960 --> 08:02.160
that wanted to express some

08:03.240 --> 08:07.560
I hope of, will not turn out to have been just a limited number of

08:08.080 --> 08:11.080
ideas and feelings, and

08:12.980 --> 08:15.980
fantasy seemed to be best suited to it.

08:15.980 --> 08:19.980
Also, the combination of fantasy and

08:19.980 --> 08:21.820
science fiction allowed

08:23.940 --> 08:27.520
me to work at, even then I think,

08:29.440 --> 08:31.880
an element of irony and

08:31.880 --> 08:35.620
contradiction, which I've always enjoyed, and which is

08:35.620 --> 08:39.880
I think you've got to be pretty talented, much more than I, to do it

08:39.880 --> 08:43.720
in a real-world situation, historical or mainstream

08:43.720 --> 08:44.220
fiction.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.820
There's also another thing, I guess, for I find humor very difficult.

08:52.100 --> 08:56.360
I cry myself in normal life, having a very good sense of humor.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.760
But the writings, none of the books

08:59.760 --> 09:02.340
are at least as jolly, I'm afraid to say.

09:03.560 --> 09:07.400
And the contradiction in irony, and I suppose

09:09.360 --> 09:10.640
allowed for

09:10.640 --> 09:12.460
a reservoir of

09:15.900 --> 09:17.760
I guess, bitterness

09:19.300 --> 09:22.600
to just get out on the outside

09:22.600 --> 09:25.800
and express itself, and to operate in these

09:28.180 --> 09:29.360
half-crippled

09:30.400 --> 09:34.580
contradictory worlds that I just naturally seem drawn to.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.720
Like I said, I hope I'm not

09:38.720 --> 09:40.760
going to stay there forever, I certainly don't want to.

09:42.220 --> 09:45.600
But it had a very peculiar allure to me.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.340
And also, it was completely out of step, but what

09:50.340 --> 09:53.760
contemporary adolescent society was

09:54.740 --> 09:58.680
saying was to literally, sensitive kids ought to be

09:58.680 --> 10:00.680
doing, so they're trying to do the exact opposite.

10:02.380 --> 10:06.600
And try to offend my peers, I think I've succeeded on one more occasion when I should

10:06.600 --> 10:09.940
but that was the fortunate thing about going to Kenyon because that was very

10:10.480 --> 10:13.940
tolerant, I think, one of the two genuinely

10:14.540 --> 10:15.020
eccentric

10:18.380 --> 10:19.960
stimulating places I've been to.

10:22.040 --> 10:26.520
So that's, also, I'll bring up

10:26.520 --> 10:30.280
one more thing, the works that the books that I was reading

10:30.280 --> 10:34.660
at the time, of the novels that I was thoroughly impressed by

10:34.660 --> 10:38.840
were included to Bradbury's work and later on to College Tolkien

10:40.600 --> 10:42.500
and on TV, of course,

10:42.760 --> 10:46.080
it's very favored to Twilight Zone, that sort of thing.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.620
So it kind of cut down the conversation when you attempted to tell

10:50.620 --> 10:54.320
people what you were doing and either they weren't

10:55.080 --> 10:58.720
interested in writing at all or the kind of writing they were interested in

10:58.720 --> 11:02.440
just simply didn't match up with what this stuff was turning out as.

11:03.620 --> 11:06.660
But I just, I really enjoyed it, I felt comfortable

11:06.660 --> 11:10.640
and felt that I could do it well, I think that's

11:10.640 --> 11:11.320
probably the main reason.

11:13.780 --> 11:17.920
Okay, Lords of the Starship came out in 1967 and

11:18.440 --> 11:22.140
it was, as you mentioned, it's kind of pessimistic

11:23.300 --> 11:26.060
decadent societies, entropy is about

11:26.060 --> 11:29.900
maximized both socially and physically. That would

11:29.900 --> 11:33.640
be something which now we could, we would call

11:33.640 --> 11:37.960
probably a new wave quote unquote. Were you influenced by people

11:37.960 --> 11:41.580
like J.G. Ballard and Michael Morkock and the people that wrote them

11:41.580 --> 11:43.580
the new wave science fiction, very British?

11:43.800 --> 11:49.700
Yeah, I thoroughly impressed by Ballard's stuff, not really Morkock too much.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.020
Paul Anderson,

11:53.920 --> 11:57.140
his adventures, I remember

11:57.140 --> 12:00.940
they were quite impressive. I especially like

12:00.940 --> 12:05.040
to get back to the contradiction, the survival of

12:05.040 --> 12:08.760
what our contemporary society is, its survival

12:08.760 --> 12:12.420
into a totally unexpected, hopefully unexpected

12:14.820 --> 12:16.260
society and

12:17.100 --> 12:21.120
society of decline. That in a way, and maybe this is

12:21.120 --> 12:24.720
a cheap reason for doing it, but it allows the

12:24.720 --> 12:28.540
aesthetics of what I view to be our science

12:28.540 --> 12:31.100
and technology, even though it has failed,

12:31.900 --> 12:36.660
I certainly don't blame what happened to bring about the societies

12:36.660 --> 12:40.060
that are present in the first book, but

12:40.060 --> 12:44.520
they failed to stop them from occurring, but they did survive in

12:44.520 --> 12:48.240
fragments and I'd like to think that

12:48.240 --> 12:51.480
it acquired some kind of a tragic heroism

12:52.700 --> 12:55.300
by what they were doing. The societies,

12:55.700 --> 12:59.020
the bad societies that were in the first

12:59.020 --> 13:03.340
book, and really in the second, were really caused by whatever causes the bad

13:03.340 --> 13:04.800
society and simple stupidity.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.280
The artifacts, which if we would think

13:11.280 --> 13:15.140
back, I'm just trying to remember you're my contemporaries, so you can remember this

13:15.140 --> 13:18.560
great day of the 60s and so on. The artifacts

13:18.560 --> 13:22.740
that I enjoyed writing about, the ships in the aircraft

13:22.740 --> 13:26.680
and the devices in the science and industry, they remain

13:26.680 --> 13:30.080
in isolation. They're usually

13:30.080 --> 13:34.240
beset. The people who are allied with them are

13:34.240 --> 13:38.680
if not heroic and they're not as bad as the other folks

13:39.380 --> 13:42.080
and that kind of threw them

13:43.800 --> 13:46.260
fragments into a contract

13:46.260 --> 13:50.160
but I at least I believe made them

13:50.160 --> 13:54.080
a little on the heroic side because they battled against the inevitable

13:54.080 --> 13:55.080
and I really like that.

13:57.580 --> 14:02.480
This idea of the society constructing a starship

14:02.480 --> 14:05.940
which is going to take centuries to complete,

14:06.460 --> 14:10.240
I know you were a history major, is there any kind of historical precedent

14:10.240 --> 14:13.120
for that on a much smaller scale that gave you the idea?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.940
No, not at all. The idea itself

14:19.140 --> 14:21.360
here I'm really trying to think back

14:21.360 --> 14:25.020
because the individual suggestions you get when you're

14:26.640 --> 14:29.100
thinking about trying to start a story

14:29.100 --> 14:33.080
and you're gathering in the hooks and suggestions that pop

14:33.080 --> 14:37.320
up can be so minor that I'm just

14:37.320 --> 14:41.140
trying to think back and I can't really remember any similar historical

14:42.060 --> 14:44.660
parallel although I'm sure it's been tried

14:44.660 --> 14:49.080
and I guess some terms have come to mind

14:49.080 --> 14:52.500
although as much as a social purpose is

14:53.040 --> 14:57.020
any expression of a religious ideal or a field of civil

14:57.020 --> 15:01.220
engineering. I think what it came out as is first of all just the sheer

15:01.220 --> 15:05.000
image of something that spectacular and

15:05.000 --> 15:08.800
given the image then I thought well how can we make a contradictory

15:08.800 --> 15:12.760
and it became contradictory by turning the hope into the

15:12.760 --> 15:16.660
eventual reason of ruin and it proceeded along those lines

15:16.660 --> 15:18.580
nothing that I'm thinking of in my

15:19.700 --> 15:23.900
as a reader of history I don't think

15:23.900 --> 15:26.560
it's suggested that that's the way the idea evolved.

15:27.260 --> 15:32.540
It's a very entertaining book because it did evolve as it was being written

15:33.160 --> 15:34.400
and a lot of fun.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.400
And you were a sophomore in college

15:37.400 --> 15:40.800
that was written. Right.

15:41.880 --> 15:46.480
Did you get encouragement from your peers, your professors, did they know what

15:46.480 --> 15:50.060
you were doing? Well my

15:50.060 --> 15:54.020
English professor, a very fine fellow named Norman Fildes

15:54.020 --> 15:58.040
in the freshman year I showed some of my short stories to and he was one of the

15:58.040 --> 16:01.220
few people who said this is pretty good stuff so I'm going to keep at it.

16:01.220 --> 16:05.160
The problem I had with Kenyon was that the English

16:05.160 --> 16:09.020
department was so good I was a little scared of it. That's another reason why

16:09.020 --> 16:10.260
I stayed as a history major.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.300
The encouragement I had just to people

16:16.300 --> 16:20.440
generally what I related to them were pretty encouraging

16:20.440 --> 16:25.340
but it wasn't what you might

16:25.340 --> 16:29.360
say a literary environment in the sense

16:29.360 --> 16:33.500
that in my everyday the people I was in eternity and in class

16:33.500 --> 16:37.100
and so on like that there wasn't any seething hot bit of

16:38.000 --> 16:41.380
you know literary endeavor what are you doing, what are you trying to say

16:41.380 --> 16:44.980
and all that sort of nonsense. It was being built and there was interest

16:44.980 --> 16:47.960
and I was able to talk about it

16:47.960 --> 16:49.660
and at least

16:53.220 --> 16:55.840
the interest was there. It was a men's college

16:55.840 --> 16:59.400
so the social structure was considerably simplified over

16:59.400 --> 17:03.900
a very small men's college too. So the social structure

17:03.900 --> 17:06.560
was considerably simplified I gather over what would have been a

17:07.940 --> 17:11.140
comparable large co-ed university

17:13.080 --> 17:15.680
and even though the social forms weren't there

17:15.680 --> 17:19.760
the eccentricity was and that

17:19.760 --> 17:23.160
I think is what helped it along

17:23.160 --> 17:26.860
and maybe even allowed it to

17:26.860 --> 17:30.880
grow in what I think what I hope was a nice kind of twisting and

17:30.880 --> 17:34.600
unexpected way as far as the plot and the setting and so on goes.

17:35.660 --> 17:38.480
As far as my mother of course is great encouragement when I was ready

17:39.080 --> 17:43.140
as far as high school goes my English teacher

17:43.140 --> 17:47.140
in my senior year in honors English was quite

17:47.140 --> 17:50.460
definite after showing some of my stuff that I could not write.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.880
So that was a lot of encouragement from that.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.780
And of course at law school nobody reads so they hardly have any idea what writing is

17:57.780 --> 18:01.140
and that wasn't any encouragement at all.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.820
But by then I was pretty much worried about myself.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.640
How does a college sophomore then get his manuscript

18:10.640 --> 18:13.700
published? Did you have any extra problems with that?

18:14.400 --> 18:17.500
Well this is this I was kind of lucky when I did my

18:18.740 --> 18:19.840
amateur...are you still there?

18:20.540 --> 18:22.720
Yeah I can hear you fine.

18:23.960 --> 18:29.520
I was pretty lucky I did a little amateur market research and immediately saw it during those days

18:29.520 --> 18:33.280
that Ace Paperbacks was easily publishing the greatest volume of

18:33.280 --> 18:37.400
titles and I had some very good

18:37.400 --> 18:39.100
authors and they had a lot of real thinkers.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.360
So I thought well obviously that's the place to go and

18:45.560 --> 18:48.320
my family is as I said outside of Philadelphia

18:48.320 --> 18:52.160
and during one vacation my sophomore or even junior year

18:52.760 --> 18:56.580
I simply put the only final copy of it

18:56.580 --> 18:58.920
I had in the paper bag and left it off at the desk.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.060
And with a letter I went back to college

19:04.060 --> 19:08.280
and a month or two later my parents called me up, called me up, had an offer

19:08.280 --> 19:12.460
a nice letter from Donald Wilhine the editor to publish it

19:12.460 --> 19:15.480
with more money than I'd ever seen in one place before.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.040
Which is not much but it was a really nice thing.

19:20.300 --> 19:24.600
I had a pretty good time at it and then it came out.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.860
So that sounds a little

19:28.410 --> 19:32.320
you know, shot in the dark

19:32.320 --> 19:33.400
that's exactly what it was.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.120
That makes it sound easy.

19:37.980 --> 19:41.100
I was lucky. Donald Wilhine's a really first-rate guy

19:41.100 --> 19:43.760
and I certainly enjoyed all the dealings I've had with him.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.040
And obviously he's got wonderful taste.

19:49.160 --> 19:53.580
Okay out of the mouth of the dragon as I read it was said in the same

19:53.580 --> 19:56.620
milieu. Did you

19:56.620 --> 20:01.520
conceive of it or the basic idea why you were finishing Lord of the Starship

20:01.520 --> 20:03.920
or did it just spring out by itself?

20:03.920 --> 20:07.680
Well it came after Lord of the Starship and I was kind of wondering

20:07.680 --> 20:11.600
it was actually suggested by, at least as I remember the

20:12.520 --> 20:16.260
sequence, it was suggested by a story by Faulkner called

20:16.260 --> 20:19.220
The Bear and as I remember it in that story

20:20.860 --> 20:23.900
there was just a little bit, not terribly inventive, but I made an

20:23.900 --> 20:27.760
impression on it. God creates man and then watches

20:27.760 --> 20:31.820
and horrors a man who runs around and does all these unexpected, terrible

20:31.820 --> 20:35.700
things. Well that's what I mean, thinking that obviously God created a great

20:35.700 --> 20:39.740
number of other things too, time for one and

20:39.740 --> 20:44.140
the course of the universe and what happens if they got equally out of control.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.320
That allowed, well the next step

20:48.320 --> 20:52.380
from there of course is to begin a story

20:52.380 --> 20:55.440
with what was supposed to have been the end of the world, Armageddon,

20:56.020 --> 20:59.500
and then show how time and the

21:01.060 --> 21:04.760
arrange plan of society, or pardon me, the universe for that matter,

21:05.380 --> 21:09.380
got progressively more chaotic and out of hand and what does one do in such an

21:09.380 --> 21:14.760
environment? Of course I was real depressed when I was

21:14.760 --> 21:18.980
read, but the

21:19.500 --> 21:21.800
action basically revolved around this

21:24.380 --> 21:27.940
society trying to operate in what was becoming a progressively more

21:27.940 --> 21:31.200
random and blindly vicious

21:31.940 --> 21:35.920
kind of universe, where even the physical laws were getting out of hand

21:35.920 --> 21:39.960
and then eventually reaching what was meant to be

21:39.960 --> 21:42.780
both symbolic and a literal

21:43.680 --> 21:46.240
way to end time, end time by

21:46.240 --> 21:51.560
killing everything, that's when the hero at the end assumes a

21:52.620 --> 21:54.980
I guess an Antichrist figure

21:54.980 --> 21:56.120
in essence

21:58.760 --> 22:02.120
that's the universe, or that's the ocean as a life force.

22:02.300 --> 22:05.200
Really, I hope it didn't sound that ponders on the rest,

22:07.600 --> 22:08.960
but there is a basic

22:11.040 --> 22:14.640
symbolistic underline, underframe to a lot of it.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.860
It also had

22:18.860 --> 22:23.200
a little idea in that, I think, which may have also come up from the first,

22:23.740 --> 22:27.120
that in line with the orders of creation, you'd say

22:27.120 --> 22:30.260
that well, God with the motivating force

22:30.900 --> 22:35.320
creates man in time, or rather, well he creates time, of course, first,

22:35.600 --> 22:39.280
and then man in the physical universe, and then the next level down is when

22:39.280 --> 22:43.540
man creates machine, as in his little area of sub-creation,

22:44.200 --> 22:47.260
and then when the creations

22:47.260 --> 22:50.980
of divine creations fail to work correctly

22:50.980 --> 22:55.620
and get out of hand, and it's up to man and his sub-creation,

22:55.780 --> 22:59.280
the machine, to if not correct it,

22:59.400 --> 23:03.160
then at least bring some kind of relief from it, and that's what they do.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.540
I try to encourage people to read your

23:10.540 --> 23:14.600
work, although I don't loan my books out because I'm a collector and they're getting old.

23:15.620 --> 23:18.880
But I don't, the potential suicides

23:18.880 --> 23:21.780
are the depressed people. I don't encourage them to read it at the time.

23:22.300 --> 23:25.940
Like I said, I just can't get the humor in there.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.240
I've got to try that more.

23:28.580 --> 23:33.940
Yeah, because it starts out with failure by Rupert Brooke, which is not real uplifting,

23:34.080 --> 23:37.800
and then goes to revelations, and then on from there.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.760
Yeah, it really didn't cut a lot of monster with dates, either, I'll tell you that.

23:42.960 --> 23:43.400
Yeah.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.520
The image I wanted to talk to you about

23:48.520 --> 23:52.620
of Cavendish's talking skeleton, that stuck with me

23:52.620 --> 23:56.300
since I read it. And that really blew me away.

23:57.620 --> 24:00.220
I don't like to ask how people got ideas,

24:00.340 --> 24:02.280
but how the hell did you get that idea?

24:02.960 --> 24:06.280
It just seemed to be a good thing to do. If the Antichrist is going towards

24:07.120 --> 24:10.100
some kind of crucifixion of the universe, might as well have a last supper,

24:10.100 --> 24:13.400
and he just happened to be at what was originally

24:14.220 --> 24:18.000
an old battlefield, so I kind of screwed up my courage with

24:19.700 --> 24:22.260
a...well, screwed up my courage,

24:22.500 --> 24:24.980
and had a couple beers and sat down and wrote it that way.

24:25.140 --> 24:28.280
It was a very obvious parallel way of supper.

24:29.520 --> 24:34.420
The idea of the artificial larynx in the Christ figure,

24:35.000 --> 24:36.560
Tim and I are the figures, I think it was name one,

24:39.060 --> 24:40.260
that itself

24:40.260 --> 24:43.440
is a repeat of the idea of these

24:43.440 --> 24:47.720
sub-creations of God, man, machine,

24:48.160 --> 24:52.520
and when the top level fails, then the bottom level

24:52.520 --> 24:56.300
has to carry the burden, however clumsily or imperfectly.

24:56.760 --> 25:00.580
And when the guy dies, his machinery keeps on talking,

25:00.740 --> 25:03.120
and actually ends up telling the truth.

25:05.540 --> 25:07.060
So how it came about

25:07.060 --> 25:10.640
was it didn't really...it was just kind of a progressive thing.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.360
That's continually...

25:14.460 --> 25:19.020
I suppose it's the thing that brings one or leads me back to writing.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.560
It just feels good,

25:22.740 --> 25:26.680
even though it's hard. It's like running every day. I don't do that every day either.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.180
But it's the excitement that when you start

25:31.180 --> 25:32.340
doing these things,

25:36.060 --> 25:39.000
you really...at least I can't, I can't plan a story

25:39.000 --> 25:42.780
in advance. I don't outline things. I have basic ideas, concepts,

25:42.980 --> 25:47.460
and rough ideas of character, and what's going to happen for at least a measurable portion

25:47.460 --> 25:50.740
of the story. But once you get started, just the

25:51.440 --> 25:54.300
background of the furniture that you're describing,

25:54.600 --> 25:58.620
instead of constructing the physical world that the characters are moving through,

25:59.960 --> 26:02.840
that so often suggests something new

26:04.400 --> 26:05.420
and unexpected.

26:06.220 --> 26:10.500
And it never happens, of course, until you sit down and actually do it, because then you

26:10.500 --> 26:14.920
haven't picked out the detail that suggests the

26:14.920 --> 26:18.380
next move. The artificial larynx

26:18.380 --> 26:22.580
on the Christ figure out of the mouth of the dragon was just in line with

26:22.580 --> 26:26.200
this basic idea. Well, you know, the guy is...he's trying to be

26:26.200 --> 26:29.980
a good Christ, and he's trying to tell

26:29.980 --> 26:33.180
his revelation. But he gets caught in the battle, the

26:35.160 --> 26:37.060
battle on the burn,

26:38.140 --> 26:41.580
which is even before the Armageddon, and you know, he gets

26:41.580 --> 26:46.060
a voice shot out. It's the very tool he was going to use to rouse

26:46.060 --> 26:49.900
righteousness again. Well, the man comes along and tries to give him something

26:49.900 --> 26:53.660
almost as good. And in its way, it turns out to be

26:54.280 --> 26:56.820
not as good as the first, the natural voice,

26:57.420 --> 27:01.300
but it has its own virtues. First of all, it survives the Christ's death,

27:01.460 --> 27:04.280
and secondly, like I said, it actually ends up telling the truth.

27:06.580 --> 27:09.500
So that's...you know, I can't say that I found

27:09.500 --> 27:13.360
something or somebody said something to me, I think what happened, and it just sat in and

27:13.360 --> 27:17.820
wrote it, and that's the way the aesthetics, or the furniture,

27:18.060 --> 27:21.620
or the background, or the layout of some initial scenes suggested

27:21.620 --> 27:25.360
themselves, and the direction the story went in.

27:25.600 --> 27:29.060
That's one of the great senses of

27:30.000 --> 27:33.460
discovery you get when you're writing, and one of the real enjoyment. And it's also something that

27:33.460 --> 27:37.300
people don't write, and of course they

27:37.300 --> 27:41.420
don't write, so this never happens, so they're not

27:41.420 --> 27:45.580
convinced that it will happen, so everybody can clue...well, a lot of people can clue they

27:45.580 --> 27:49.520
can't, so they never do. Even for people who have written such

27:49.520 --> 27:53.320
things to themselves, it's a real, real easy, even though you remember

27:53.320 --> 27:57.520
that this is the way it almost is. Well, it very often works,

27:57.560 --> 28:00.320
as I'm saying inevitably or invariably, but it's not that.

28:00.860 --> 28:05.720
But it certainly works often enough to try it again, but convincing yourself that it's going to work one more time

28:05.720 --> 28:09.180
is awful hard, and it's still a grind just to get there

28:09.180 --> 28:13.560
and put the paper in, and start telling

28:13.560 --> 28:14.900
who's in the room and how's he dressed.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.120
You don't really start finding

28:19.120 --> 28:21.440
the little clues to what's going to happen next, but you do that.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.540
Both of these books

28:27.460 --> 28:31.040
are critically acclaimed. I don't remember reading any bad reviews,

28:31.220 --> 28:34.780
in fact, all the reviews have been laudatory. Would you just as soon

28:34.780 --> 28:38.780
write a critically acclaimed book as one that makes a million

28:38.780 --> 28:42.860
dollars, I mean, let alone, assuming that you're comfortable and that you don't need

28:42.860 --> 28:45.140
a million dollars, but is there some satisfaction there?

28:45.640 --> 28:50.240
Well, I really don't think that I have enough either craft or talent

28:50.670 --> 28:54.940
to squander doing either one or the other. The books that were written were the ones

28:54.940 --> 28:58.920
that I wanted to write. Unfortunately, I don't have to

28:58.920 --> 29:02.720
write for a living, although perhaps if I did, I might be

29:02.720 --> 29:04.960
doing something a lot more intense.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.680
So what I'm extremely gratified

29:10.680 --> 29:14.480
is that I'm extremely gratified that people

29:14.480 --> 29:18.060
say you still remember the darn thing. That

29:18.500 --> 29:22.200
really makes it a lot of it

29:22.200 --> 29:26.520
still worthwhile. But as far as the difference

29:26.520 --> 29:29.360
between just one address the critics, just one address

29:30.420 --> 29:34.780
whatever one conceives to be the upper crust of literary sensibility

29:34.780 --> 29:37.320
or just one go for the great unwashed,

29:38.140 --> 29:41.240
gee, I don't know if anybody can really make

29:41.240 --> 29:45.200
that conscious choice. The idea of the polished hack

29:45.200 --> 29:48.600
is a great one, but I don't think there's all that many of them around. There are people

29:49.160 --> 29:52.660
that have caught on. Harold Rawls, of course,

29:53.240 --> 29:57.260
comes right to mind, and there are people who write very

29:57.260 --> 30:01.200
well-acclaimed and moderately successful ones like John Gardner, who just

30:01.200 --> 30:05.400
died a couple days ago. But I think basically

30:05.400 --> 30:09.460
they simply write what they think is correct, and if they do that

30:09.460 --> 30:13.380
they're going to do a good job, and even if it's a piece of hack work, at least it will be a good piece of

30:13.380 --> 30:16.380
hack work, and they'll hold together in some coherent fashion.

30:18.660 --> 30:21.200
And if a fellow wants to do something

30:21.200 --> 30:24.920
that appears to be a bit harder, and then

30:24.920 --> 30:28.700
of course equates that with the too often with

30:29.540 --> 30:32.840
literary endurance or artistic endurance, then he's going to.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.300
The point is to do

30:37.260 --> 30:40.620
a good story. If you do the good story, you think the good story is

30:41.660 --> 30:45.060
then I think either way it turns out. And if it's critically acclaimed

30:45.060 --> 30:48.620
and still well remembered, gee, that's probably

30:48.620 --> 30:51.840
not as much as you could ask for, the $1 million bucks,

30:52.040 --> 30:56.860
that's not bad either. Okay, we'll move

30:56.860 --> 31:01.180
on to the Day Star. You were in law school when you wrote the Day Star?

31:01.180 --> 31:03.300
Well actually I started that

31:04.820 --> 31:08.360
on numerous occasions. I started it, I think while I was still in college.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.820
One reason why is that

31:12.820 --> 31:17.100
the person I was dating at the time was convinced having read the first two that

31:17.100 --> 31:21.100
I could not write anything in the least bit nice, and this is going to

31:21.620 --> 31:25.100
prove her wrong. I began to think she was

31:25.100 --> 31:28.980
right when I didn't get the right word on it. So

31:28.980 --> 31:32.280
after numerous false starts, it just kind of lay around with an

31:32.840 --> 31:36.380
essential idea until the end of law school.

31:36.820 --> 31:40.480
I was in New York University at the Law School of

31:40.480 --> 31:45.080
Washington Square, and Don Mulheim was still at that time

31:45.080 --> 31:49.560
at DAW, or pardon me,

31:49.600 --> 31:52.580
Hays before he went to a New American Library

31:52.580 --> 31:57.000
and formed a name under DAW.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.660
And I tried and I tried.

32:00.940 --> 32:04.660
It always turned out a little short and really pretty big.

32:06.140 --> 32:08.820
Can I say a nasty word on there? Go right ahead.

32:09.020 --> 32:12.920
We don't have to put it on, but go ahead and say it. Okay, well the funny thing is,

32:12.980 --> 32:17.140
and one thing I really liked, because it made me feel like a real pro and like I knew

32:17.140 --> 32:21.140
what I was doing, is I went up and after he said we couldn't use it,

32:21.240 --> 32:24.680
it was framed in the children's story originally, and I had to

32:24.680 --> 32:28.300
straight ahead and I said well, you know, we worked before together

32:28.300 --> 32:32.260
in two degrees. What's the problem with it? He said well you know,

32:32.440 --> 32:36.000
it's kind of rough because it really doesn't suit any of our audience.

32:36.200 --> 32:39.580
It's certainly not a children's story. It's much too

32:40.620 --> 32:44.020
complicated for that, and it's not really a science fiction story.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.660
So it really doesn't address our customary audience.

32:48.520 --> 32:52.580
I said, well, gee whiz, what do I do with it? Any suggestions?

32:53.160 --> 32:56.620
He kind of leaned back in his chair and waved. He said oh, throwing

32:56.620 --> 33:00.420
some of that scientific bullshit, you know how to do it. And I started talking

33:00.420 --> 33:03.560
a little bit after that, and after about five minutes, we had a little discussion.

33:03.720 --> 33:08.260
We had an idea that eventually, well right there became the idea of the time

33:08.260 --> 33:12.780
wind blowing through the various worlds that were arranged in the fashion

33:12.780 --> 33:17.280
of the novelist shelf and unifying them. And from there,

33:17.480 --> 33:20.460
I think that landed a real note of coherency

33:20.460 --> 33:24.900
to what was going on, and went back, rewrote it,

33:25.080 --> 33:28.640
and that's all. And it came out under the DAW level.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.640
So that was a real nice little bit. I really enjoyed that.

33:33.560 --> 33:36.540
This book seemed a lot more allegorical

33:36.540 --> 33:40.460
than the others. They were more of the straight science fantasy.

33:40.620 --> 33:43.420
I don't know if allegorical is the right word. I'm not an English major, but

33:44.440 --> 33:47.740
just a little more magical and whimsical than the others.

33:47.740 --> 33:51.360
That's the original thrust of it. It was meant to be

33:52.040 --> 33:55.720
much more of the idea of the dream world being more

33:55.720 --> 33:59.640
concrete than the waking world, and of multiple dream worlds

33:59.640 --> 34:02.960
beyond the one of immediate sleep.

34:03.820 --> 34:07.000
And then of course the ghost can move back and forth because he is

34:07.740 --> 34:11.720
a dream character. And then the hero

34:11.720 --> 34:15.320
becomes progressively more of a dream character himself, and he can move

34:15.320 --> 34:19.760
back and forth through these worlds until he

34:19.760 --> 34:21.660
comes to this

34:23.280 --> 34:25.340
great shining city, you know, a parent,

34:29.380 --> 34:31.600
and finds out what's going on.

34:31.800 --> 34:35.480
Of course at the end, he ends his own little

34:35.480 --> 34:39.220
ruin and a little bit of despair because it is an actual live book,

34:39.280 --> 34:43.360
so I couldn't let anybody go happy. But it was originally

34:43.360 --> 34:46.240
intended as a children's story, and

34:47.480 --> 34:51.240
I hope it didn't turn out to be two overwrought, or two overblown,

34:51.340 --> 34:55.020
or two prolet. But that was the

34:56.060 --> 34:59.200
ephemeral kind of instruction to retain throughout

34:59.200 --> 35:00.900
throughout its course.

35:02.460 --> 35:07.360
To me it seems like you have a little preface where you say

35:07.360 --> 35:11.240
something. This is the way things were once explained to me, and that seems kind of like

35:11.240 --> 35:14.600
a bridge between your old stuff because it's got the

35:15.620 --> 35:19.300
symbol of the solitary machine lost during the route of a long dead army.

35:20.280 --> 35:23.280
And then you move to this kind of dreamy

35:23.280 --> 35:27.320
book, and that almost seemed like a bridge to me when I read it from your old stuff to your new stuff,

35:27.320 --> 35:29.340
which may be reading too much into it.

35:29.480 --> 35:34.480
No, I think you're correct. It's also as I felt at the time, because

35:35.440 --> 35:39.200
most discrepancies were for the people in law school.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.000
And I was kind of

35:43.000 --> 35:46.140
wondering where my own perspective was going at that moment.

35:47.780 --> 35:51.140
And also this book had been planned, or I had been

35:51.140 --> 35:54.880
writing it off and on for three years. So

35:55.440 --> 35:59.520
it seemed to be a little bit of my own sentiment the way I felt at the time.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.440
I thought the production,

36:03.680 --> 36:06.320
the cover, the George Barr cover, and the George Barr

36:09.840 --> 36:11.180
illustrations throughout the book,

36:11.320 --> 36:14.660
that was a pretty classy package that Dawg doesn't seem to do that anymore.

36:15.360 --> 36:18.840
How do you feel as an author, looking at your work and seeing the

36:18.840 --> 36:21.540
illustrations and that sort of thing? Are they, as you imagined them?

36:21.860 --> 36:25.940
Oh yes, yes. Very flattering, very thrilling. Always nice to see

36:27.500 --> 36:30.260
your imagination visualized as well as

36:30.260 --> 36:34.640
I guess, verbalized. And it's always nice to know

36:34.640 --> 36:38.060
that somebody else read it too. And it's found that

36:39.160 --> 36:41.940
even though the guy was walking, that it had some

36:41.940 --> 36:46.500
enough of a power of suggestion that it's translated over

36:46.500 --> 36:50.240
into somebody else's imagination. As far as

36:50.240 --> 36:54.100
paintings go, I still, my absolute favor was the first

36:54.820 --> 36:58.320
cover on the piece paperback edition of Lord and the Starship.

36:58.780 --> 37:02.640
That I really liked. Although I have to say that all four

37:03.240 --> 37:06.580
have, well the first two were reprinted to Hardcover in France

37:06.580 --> 37:10.620
last year in a single Hardcover volume and then the second

37:11.660 --> 37:14.440
third and fourth should be out right about

37:14.440 --> 37:18.600
now, I believe by French publishing house called OPTA. And they've just done a beautiful

37:19.700 --> 37:22.740
job in their own illustrations and redoing

37:22.740 --> 37:26.560
the map of the world and stuff like that. So that's always very, very

37:26.560 --> 37:31.920
thrilling. Okay, then the Siege of Wonder, which

37:31.920 --> 37:36.040
seemed to kind of get back to the same

37:36.040 --> 37:39.240
theme as the original two books, The Far Future.

37:40.040 --> 37:44.320
But it had the fantasy element, much more of a fantasy element with the magic

37:44.320 --> 37:48.400
versus the science. Right, well it was a very clear cut. I wrote that

37:48.400 --> 37:51.920
again, this is to put it in something of a social context.

37:53.180 --> 37:55.800
Let's see, 74 or

37:55.800 --> 37:58.820
5, when I suppose

37:59.440 --> 38:01.520
all the hippies were going into retirement.

38:02.740 --> 38:06.600
But again, the technology was not highly

38:06.600 --> 38:10.720
thought of. But I believe that, and as I still do right now,

38:10.800 --> 38:12.940
there's a great deal of romance to it.

38:14.880 --> 38:18.660
A great deal of beauty and as I said, it's explicit, it's not explicit

38:18.660 --> 38:22.920
heroism. And it's used. And to keep that in mind

38:22.920 --> 38:26.560
I was reading a book, I think it was Algus Butterys

38:26.560 --> 38:30.420
I think, you know, possibly. Anyway,

38:30.580 --> 38:34.080
a book of criticism, science fiction, and a history, a critical history called the

38:34.080 --> 38:38.080
Billion Years' Freed. That's Brian Oldis. Yeah, very good book.

38:38.420 --> 38:42.140
And I, you wrote the other point out,

38:42.340 --> 38:46.400
the very obvious fact that there isn't that

38:46.400 --> 38:50.460
terribly much of a difference between fantasy, classical fantasy

38:50.460 --> 38:54.320
sword and sorcery, and science fiction. Even Space Stopper

38:54.320 --> 38:58.040
science fiction, because each one ultimately depends on the impossible

38:58.040 --> 39:02.740
before the action. On the one you have Turning Lefty Gold and the Prince of the Frog,

39:03.420 --> 39:06.540
which is a physical impossibility. On the other you have

39:08.180 --> 39:10.280
physical ships shooting the speed of light

39:10.280 --> 39:13.780
which as far as we know is an equal impossibility. So they really

39:14.260 --> 39:18.260
both proceed from the same suspension of disbelief as Coleridge

39:18.260 --> 39:22.080
would say. But very often you do get

39:23.120 --> 39:24.500
not so much anymore,

39:26.020 --> 39:29.560
but you do get this artificially sharp

39:29.560 --> 39:33.000
distinction between fantasy on the one hand and the Lord of the Rings, and

39:33.740 --> 39:36.020
let's say the analog school of science fiction.

39:37.520 --> 39:42.120
Given that, it occurred to me that why not just cut out

39:42.120 --> 39:45.520
the shilly-shallying and just have a direct collision between the two.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.680
And that's where you get the war between science and magic.

39:49.680 --> 39:53.500
The way I envisioned it, again although it has

39:53.500 --> 39:56.660
an ending that's typical for me with despair and all that,

39:56.840 --> 40:01.760
but the way I thought about that

40:01.760 --> 40:05.320
book was really, if you remember Bill Maldon's cartoon

40:05.320 --> 40:08.980
character is Joe and Willie. It's kind of like Joe and Willie meet Elric

40:10.700 --> 40:13.200
where you do have the

40:13.200 --> 40:15.980
grand delinquents of fantasy

40:16.760 --> 40:20.880
confronted by the very real

40:20.880 --> 40:24.280
and very truly destructive

40:24.280 --> 40:25.560
or powerful,

40:28.180 --> 40:31.720
but by the same token I think more humane forces

40:31.720 --> 40:35.940
of science and technology. At least that's the way I

40:35.940 --> 40:39.800
saw it. And the direct collision of the two, neither

40:39.800 --> 40:44.000
are particularly nice guys, although I found, and I think

40:44.000 --> 40:47.180
they came across the greater sympathy and side of science.

40:49.060 --> 40:51.740
Even though what they were doing was ultimately self-destructive

40:52.580 --> 40:55.860
or dehumanizing, which is a little contradictory, I'd say

40:55.860 --> 40:59.320
that's more humane, but perhaps even in that sense

40:59.860 --> 41:03.120
feel more humane than what magic has allowed it to become.

41:05.140 --> 41:07.280
Again, that didn't cut a lot of monsters in print.

41:09.580 --> 41:12.160
Okay, you were in Idaho by the time this one

41:12.160 --> 41:14.860
was published. Oh yes, that was written entirely out here.

41:16.280 --> 41:20.220
Okay. I had a job on it right back. What I want to do

41:20.220 --> 41:24.440
now, what I better do is turn my tape over.

41:24.700 --> 41:28.040
I have one tooth, I have four more questions on my

41:28.040 --> 41:31.100
list if you're not tired of this already.

41:31.980 --> 41:35.580
Let me turn my tapes over and get them.

41:36.300 --> 41:39.980
If you want to take a break or something, go ahead, this will take me about

41:39.980 --> 41:41.880
two minutes. Okay.
