00:01.600 --> 00:04.600
The topic was Arthur C. Clarke.

00:05.040 --> 00:10.000
But before the panelists got ready to grapple with Clarke's work, Frederick Poeul volunteered

00:10.000 --> 00:13.840
an explanation of Isaac Asimov's prolific output as a writer.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.880
170 books published to date.

00:17.240 --> 00:21.180
May I explain to you how come it is that Isaac has published so many books?

00:21.300 --> 00:21.740
Because I know.

00:22.620 --> 00:28.960
He's the only person I know who is physically addicted to having his fingers on a typewriter

00:28.960 --> 00:29.400
keyboard.

00:30.060 --> 00:35.120
If the keyboard is withdrawn for more than an hour and a half at a time, he begins to

00:35.120 --> 00:35.960
go right up the wall.

00:36.080 --> 00:40.680
You can see him now beginning to sweat and show withdrawal symptoms so that he likes

00:40.680 --> 00:41.520
to type.

00:42.220 --> 00:43.380
Well, that's true enough.

00:43.660 --> 00:44.280
That's true enough.

00:44.840 --> 00:51.080
I have published 170 books so far, all different varieties and stuff, and that's largely because

00:51.080 --> 00:56.800
writing with a few insignificant and unmentionable exceptions, writing is all I want to do.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.920
As a matter of fact, the way it's done is by not having anyone to help me.

01:00.980 --> 01:02.040
I'm a one-man operation.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.460
I have no secretary, no typist, no agent, no nothing.

01:07.060 --> 01:11.220
I answer my own letters, answer my own telephone, do my own indexing, and so on.

01:11.560 --> 01:17.120
And it's to that that I attribute the large output because if I had people working for

01:17.120 --> 01:22.700
me first place, I couldn't possibly get them to work as long hours and as unquestioningly,

01:23.240 --> 01:26.120
part of the genetic, and as unquestionably as I myself do.

01:26.120 --> 01:26.700
We would do that.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.060
As I myself do.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.040
And secondly, if I had people helping me, I'd spend most of my time telling them what

01:33.040 --> 01:37.240
to do and looking over what they did and discussing whether that's what ought to be done instead

01:37.240 --> 01:39.520
of by saving all that time I write books.

01:40.220 --> 01:41.940
Isaac, let me ask a very simple question.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.940
I know you don't read much science fiction now.

01:44.040 --> 01:44.760
You read some though.

01:45.920 --> 01:50.940
Do you feel the same thrill when you come across a good science fiction story that you used

01:50.940 --> 01:51.280
to feel?

01:52.260 --> 01:52.780
Almost.

01:53.120 --> 01:58.720
When I come across one that appeals to me and I must admit that lately it's been more

01:58.720 --> 02:00.100
trouble something it used to be.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.320
I got that thrill when I read Randeville with Rama.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.540
Okay, fair.

02:03.720 --> 02:11.920
And let's see, what was I recently read, a story that I liked very much and it's escaped

02:11.920 --> 02:12.220
me.

02:12.580 --> 02:15.800
But the trouble is that science fiction has changed easier.

02:15.980 --> 02:20.200
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it's changed faster than my inside has.

02:20.980 --> 02:23.820
And I find that it's difficult.

02:24.060 --> 02:24.760
It hasn't changed.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.100
There's still the basic core that hasn't changed that much.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.420
What's happened is that it has developed all kinds of peripheral aspects.

02:33.100 --> 02:36.940
Now a lot of people are writing things that are really fantasy and calling it science fiction.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.080
They're also writing would-be mainstreams that they're calling.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.680
They're sticking a little science fiction in in order to get it published.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.500
They're publishing anti-science books and calling them science fiction.

02:45.500 --> 02:51.900
But underneath it all there is, well Arthur C. Clarke, you mentioned Randeville with Rama.

02:52.080 --> 02:57.020
Arthur C. Clarke is still writing Visually and he's done Imperial Earth recently.

02:57.780 --> 03:02.180
Now I suspect that you and I as hardcore science fiction writers are not going to like that

03:02.180 --> 03:03.360
as well as Randeville with Rama.

03:03.740 --> 03:07.640
But I suspect that the general reader, the reader of Arthur's books is going to like

03:07.640 --> 03:12.600
it perhaps even better because the characters are more important rather than the background

03:12.600 --> 03:14.100
as it was in Randeville with Rama.

03:14.680 --> 03:19.360
It's the story of the fifth centennial of the United States and a man who comes back

03:19.360 --> 03:21.900
from space to help celebrate it and what he finds on Earth.

03:22.240 --> 03:27.580
Isaac Asimov then gave his version of the Clarke Asimov Treaty with a little help from

03:27.580 --> 03:28.400
Lester Del Rey.

03:28.820 --> 03:33.840
You know the fact that science fiction writers, especially in the old days, knew each other

03:33.840 --> 03:36.940
very well were friends as well as fellow writers.

03:37.280 --> 03:41.760
Partly it's due to the fact that in writing there's none of this sense of competition.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.100
You have many other professions.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.800
In other words, there used not to be.

03:44.920 --> 03:45.280
There is now.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.840
Well, about now I don't know.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.000
But in the old days, the fact that you sold the story didn't mean that someone else didn't

03:51.000 --> 03:51.700
sell a story.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.540
So there was no objection to being friendly, to helping each other out and so on.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.460
You both sold stories.

03:56.580 --> 03:56.780
Great.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.340
It's still true.

03:58.940 --> 03:59.360
Well, I hope so.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.200
It's still true but nowadays people, there is a lot of competition.

04:02.620 --> 04:07.420
And look, you and I and most of us when we first started in didn't really consider ourselves

04:07.420 --> 04:10.760
big professional writers making a big career out of writing and so on.

04:10.760 --> 04:15.460
We wrote the stuff because we wanted to write or because we loved it and we loved the money

04:15.460 --> 04:16.360
on the top of it.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.420
Yeah, we also liked to read each other's stories.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.160
But that's it.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.120
When a good story came in, we were so happy to see a good story that it didn't matter.

04:23.220 --> 04:24.000
So we were all friends.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.380
Now there's all kinds of things going on.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.640
Well, I'm sorry for them.

04:27.940 --> 04:32.980
Any case, among others, Arthur Clark is a good friend of mine and I remember once we

04:32.980 --> 04:39.200
were writing down a taxi on Park Park Avenue and we formed what he calls the Clark-Azimov

04:39.200 --> 04:43.180
Treaty of Park Avenue and I call it the Azimov-Clark Treaty of Park Avenue.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.280
He said, and I do think it was he who suggested it first, but I fell in with it eagerly, he

04:48.280 --> 04:52.940
said that whenever anyone was to ask me who was the best science fiction writer in the

04:52.940 --> 04:54.840
world, I was to say Arthur C. Clark.

04:55.440 --> 04:59.680
And whenever anyone asked him who was the best science writer in the world, he was to say

04:59.680 --> 05:00.720
Isaac Azimov.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.900
I've kept my part of the bargain and I'm sure he's kept his part of the bargain.

05:04.900 --> 05:09.760
I'm not sure either one really believes it, you understand, because I think each one of

05:09.760 --> 05:13.580
us secretly thinks he's first in both categories, but we stick to it.

05:13.720 --> 05:19.740
As a matter of fact, talking about the Clark-Azimov Treaty, we are so similar in styles in some

05:19.740 --> 05:21.040
way that people confuse us.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.660
At least every once in a while I get someone who writes a letter to me and tells me how

05:24.660 --> 05:27.040
much he liked my book, Childhood's End.

05:27.460 --> 05:31.880
And that, of course, is Arthur Clark's great book, the one that sort of made him a fixture

05:31.880 --> 05:32.760
in science fiction.

05:33.260 --> 05:37.560
One of the hardwarming things you know about science fiction, one of the little inside

05:37.560 --> 05:43.760
hardwarming things, is that if you're at a convention and somebody comes up to you with

05:43.760 --> 05:49.660
a book that says, well, like Childhood and by Arthur Clark and says, you know, I badly

05:49.660 --> 05:53.380
want Arthur's autograph, you will be nice and sign Arthur's name for it.

05:53.540 --> 05:54.320
We all do this.

05:54.920 --> 06:00.020
Gordon Dixon is most famous for his thematic science fiction novels, of which the Dorside

06:00.020 --> 06:01.260
trilogy is the best known.

06:01.960 --> 06:08.260
Mr. Dixon has won science fiction's two highest awards, The Hugo in 1965 for his short story,

06:08.740 --> 06:14.440
Soldier Ask Not, and The Nebula in 1966 for his novelette, Call Him Lord.

06:15.320 --> 06:20.600
His eagerly awaited fantasy novel, The Dragon and the George, will be published in paperback

06:20.600 --> 06:22.100
by Ballantine this fall.

06:35.060 --> 06:39.240
As a matter of fact, that was a bad example because Childhood's End is one I haven't

06:39.240 --> 06:46.780
signed and I think it's because Childhood's End did something and I agree with you.

06:46.940 --> 06:52.920
Arthur has written others that I rate a little higher on the scale, but Childhood's End has

06:52.920 --> 06:58.840
a bittersweet touch about it that I would like to do someday and never have, although

06:58.840 --> 07:00.080
I started out to do it sometime.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.300
Arthur has two strains.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.720
He has the very hard science strain and he has a mystical strain in his writing.

07:06.340 --> 07:11.800
And Childhood's End, like 2001, has a heavy infusion of both.

07:12.460 --> 07:13.820
It's probably what makes them popular.

07:14.100 --> 07:18.140
It does not make them as popular with me, but it certainly makes them very popular.

07:18.360 --> 07:23.280
Childhood's End is unquestionably recognized as the most popular of all Arthur's books.

07:23.700 --> 07:27.980
I happen to think that his Earthlight, which has not apparently been discovered by a lot

07:27.980 --> 07:32.380
of people, is actually a better book in many ways.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.620
Earthlight really should be reissued more than it is.

07:35.740 --> 07:37.820
I wish the people would discover what a good book it is.

07:38.360 --> 07:43.080
Arthur's work can be very hard science fiction, but it also can have that mystical quality

07:43.080 --> 07:43.480
to it.

07:43.960 --> 07:50.160
He, there are touches of that in the earliest, close to the novel, he wrote, which was, what

07:50.160 --> 07:57.140
was it, the, not the lad in the line, it was a story taking place in an ancient abandoned

07:57.140 --> 07:59.320
city with a young boy going through it.

07:59.700 --> 08:04.420
City and the Star, also known as, he published it twice under two different titles.

08:04.420 --> 08:05.260
Under two different titles?

08:05.560 --> 08:05.680
Yes.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.460
More Hood Spa than any other writer I know.

08:08.580 --> 08:14.560
Same book, slightly somewhat rewritten, published in two simultaneous editions under

08:14.560 --> 08:15.300
two different titles.

08:16.200 --> 08:16.720
I can't either.

08:16.880 --> 08:17.720
It was a great book.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.160
I have, I have, I have marked it immensely.

08:19.440 --> 08:25.200
Clark has a reputation as a hard science writer, but what strikes me as most interesting

08:25.200 --> 08:32.420
about his work is the color and invention of alien situations and surroundings and characters

08:32.420 --> 08:33.840
in City and the Star.

08:34.400 --> 08:39.920
And in his first novel, novelette, novella, rescue party, his first published story.

08:40.280 --> 08:40.800
No, second.

08:41.620 --> 08:42.360
I think it's first.

08:42.380 --> 08:45.680
Second, I had, I thought the same thing until I was checking up recently for a book I'm

08:45.680 --> 08:45.800
doing.

08:45.980 --> 08:50.300
Arthur thinks it's the first because he complains bitterly when people say it's his best because

08:50.300 --> 08:52.120
he likes to think that he's progressed since then.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.560
New Pole was his first published one.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.320
Maybe, but at any rate, one of his first.

08:56.780 --> 09:00.440
And which I think is a fine story and it's, it's not the invention in it.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.060
It's not the science in it.

09:02.060 --> 09:08.780
It's the feeling you have of a whole group of cultures meeting and interacting on each

09:08.780 --> 09:10.700
other in a way that's never happened in the world.

09:10.840 --> 09:10.960
Yes.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.280
Arthur was once accused and he hated it.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.580
And yet there's an element of truth in it, of having a very pedestrian imagination.

09:18.180 --> 09:19.940
I don't take that the way the writer meant it.

09:19.940 --> 09:23.600
Arthur does have a pedestrian imagination, which is a great asset to a writer.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.040
What he has is, he has an imagination.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.920
And we've mentioned things about his imagination and sometimes it's quite free-wheeling.

09:30.040 --> 09:34.580
But most of the time it is pedestrian in this sense that Arthur's imagination works step

09:34.580 --> 09:37.840
by step by step by step so that he details everything.

09:38.340 --> 09:42.920
He follows all the details except when he gets into a slightly mystical frame when he

09:42.920 --> 09:43.360
goes off.

09:43.620 --> 09:47.540
But his imagination and imaginary situations are detailed.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.780
You know how many legs the chair has.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.940
You know where the rungs are somehow in Arthur's stories.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.860
Pedestrian is not a word I would apply to Arthur's.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.640
I'm misusing the word deliberate.

09:57.700 --> 10:01.580
There is a word that I would apply to it that's almost equally pejorative.

10:01.740 --> 10:02.500
I think it's lucid.

10:02.940 --> 10:07.540
What impresses me most about Clark as a writer is that I understand what he's trying to communicate

10:07.540 --> 10:08.220
in every line.

10:08.220 --> 10:08.440
Yes.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.620
There's no obfuscation.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.740
There's no playing around with words just for the sake of the sound of them.

10:12.900 --> 10:16.160
Oh, what he is, he's very methodical in his thinking.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.180
Very methodically.

10:17.180 --> 10:18.080
He works everything out.

10:18.240 --> 10:23.040
And this is what the other writer, the critic called Pedestrian, which is really unfair

10:23.040 --> 10:24.280
in the usual meaning of the word.

10:24.540 --> 10:29.380
Fitting terms on Arthur, I would have used the word three dimensional.

10:30.120 --> 10:34.600
You remember in the fall of Moondust, the particular reality.

10:34.720 --> 10:34.800
It gets the fall of night.

10:35.100 --> 10:35.780
That was the other time.

10:35.860 --> 10:36.880
I guess the fall of night, yeah.

10:37.120 --> 10:37.540
That's right.

10:38.180 --> 10:44.780
But in the fall of Moondust, when the people are buried under this dust, the scene is particularly

10:44.780 --> 10:46.480
real because it's particularly solid.

10:46.880 --> 10:52.060
The world which is now narrowed down to the inside of this little sightseeing bus really

10:52.060 --> 10:56.280
has become a very hard world.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.040
You can touch it.

10:57.520 --> 10:58.940
Well, that's the trick that Arthur has.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.740
Arthur measures his future without ever losing sight of the romance of it because he still

11:03.740 --> 11:04.500
loves his futures.

11:05.020 --> 11:05.660
He measures.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.020
He knows just where everything is located.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.900
And it's a strong asset.

11:09.900 --> 11:15.680
This thoroughness, this methodical way with which he goes about making his imagination

11:15.680 --> 11:16.220
real.

11:16.560 --> 11:20.480
You'll notice, by the way, that science fiction does not get outmoded if it's good.

11:20.940 --> 11:26.380
The fact that the Moondust surface is not dusty, as some people thought before the first

11:26.380 --> 11:29.840
landing, does not make a fall of Moondust a bad story now.

11:30.080 --> 11:34.240
In the same way, the fact that we can go around the world in 80 minutes doesn't at least

11:34.240 --> 11:37.200
make around the world in 80 days a bad story.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.520
That made it by itself.

11:39.920 --> 11:40.780
Oh, I don't know.

11:40.860 --> 11:41.520
I liked it.

11:41.920 --> 11:42.540
I liked it.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.220
The fact that you don't like something lest there is meaningless.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.340
You don't like anything.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.200
No, I love a great many things.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.820
No, I don't like stock wooden characters.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.260
I don't like bathos.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.360
I don't like schlock development of a story.

11:57.900 --> 12:00.460
I don't like where the furniture to show all over the place.

12:00.560 --> 12:04.440
I don't like the big problem of a story solved by cheap trickery and a lot of other things,

12:04.460 --> 12:06.260
all of which are typical of a shoot of air.

12:06.920 --> 12:11.140
Well, this is not the place to argue Jules Vampe, but I have a feeling that he's going

12:11.140 --> 12:13.340
to keep on going even when you and I are out.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.440
But Lester Del Ray does have his likes as well.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.140
I like a great many stories.

12:18.420 --> 12:23.100
When Ursula Le Guin did Left Hand of Darkness, I jumped up and down and glee.

12:23.320 --> 12:23.980
I read the story.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.400
I reread the story immediately after reading it once, and I'll do that still to things.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.680
There are great many stories that I drag off the shelf.

12:29.780 --> 12:32.420
I drag off the Hell Clements stories periodically from the shelf.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.620
The best of those.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.860
Mission of Gravity, Cycle of Fire.

12:37.060 --> 12:37.980
Cycle of Fire, particularly.

12:38.580 --> 12:39.540
That's a magical thought.

12:40.120 --> 12:40.740
There's a...

12:40.740 --> 12:43.300
Cycle of Fire is the great underrated one of Clements.

12:43.500 --> 12:47.820
It's really a splendid story with the best characters he ever did, the best human character

12:47.820 --> 12:54.640
he ever did, and a marvelous alien character, a lovely cooperative conflict between the

12:54.640 --> 13:00.320
two, a fantastically well-developed background, and a real problem behind it all.

13:00.320 --> 13:06.360
I think perhaps his best story is from a technical point of view, and Ballantine published it.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.540
I don't know how often has it been republished.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.080
I can't remember.

13:10.220 --> 13:10.960
I have no idea.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.640
But it should have sold much better than it did, and it isn't as well appreciated.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.400
I hope that they make a big splash for it sometime.

13:20.080 --> 13:20.940
I'll be careful, Lester.

13:21.060 --> 13:22.440
You're well known as the Kiss of Death.

13:24.380 --> 13:30.420
I'd like to know who all, whether it's Hal himself or whether some university archives

13:30.420 --> 13:34.580
have got this tremendous amount of stuff that he makes up before he ever starts writing.

13:35.480 --> 13:40.580
All the dog gun, little notes from which he develops the solar system, from which he develops

13:40.580 --> 13:43.460
the planet, from which he develops the continent, from which he develops the weather.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.260
Some of that has been published, you know.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.660
He did Mission of Gravity, I think.

13:49.020 --> 13:54.680
He published an article in Astounding about what went into the writing of it.

13:55.040 --> 14:03.280
He and Paul have recently put together a particular solar system and world or something.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.480
Well, I'm not sure what you mean.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.740
There is what's known as Harlan's world, which is the world that was invented for the purpose

14:10.740 --> 14:14.480
of writing stories around at the UCLA conference.

14:14.860 --> 14:17.660
This is something that they announced that they would both be using this.

14:17.660 --> 14:22.360
They spoke out by Valentine called Fire Time by Pola Anderson, which uses this world.

14:22.740 --> 14:25.440
I haven't seen any of Clement's work on this world yet.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.340
I don't think he's actually publishing it.

14:28.420 --> 14:31.940
But, well, you know, all of us to some extent do that.

14:32.420 --> 14:38.960
I can't use Astoria faster than light travel without at least working out a theory to account

14:38.960 --> 14:39.460
for it.

14:39.640 --> 14:45.740
Or if I'm going slower than the speed of light, I very carefully work out the energy requirements

14:46.280 --> 14:47.240
of the thing.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.920
I have elaborate notes that used to take me days and days working on one of the things

14:50.920 --> 14:56.360
now that I've got myself a lovely little calculator that will do all those things almost instantly.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.800
It saves me a great deal of time.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.420
But none of this ever goes into my story.

15:01.220 --> 15:04.360
Clement and Arthur and so on put more of it into the story than I do.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.460
I've got to know this before I feel comfortable in the world I've created.

15:07.660 --> 15:08.460
I have to know this.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.700
There are writers who get along beautifully without it.

15:10.800 --> 15:15.660
I think one of my favorite science fiction writers of all time, Cordwayner Smith, never

15:15.660 --> 15:18.200
once troubled his pretty little head about space drives.

15:18.840 --> 15:22.640
What he was interested in describing was different kinds of societies.

15:23.260 --> 15:24.260
But those he worked out in detail.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.480
And he worked them out beautifully.

15:25.980 --> 15:30.000
But the mechanics of how they came to be, he never really explained.

15:30.180 --> 15:34.760
He didn't say how the spaceships managed to get from one planet to another in this immense

15:34.760 --> 15:37.000
galaxy-wide culture that he dealt with.

15:37.580 --> 15:43.780
He didn't really explain how the robot imitations of human beings existed or what the evolved

15:43.780 --> 15:45.460
cat people and dog people.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.960
But his little kitten goes into detail a little bit.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.580
You think the mechanics of space drives are your right.

15:50.800 --> 15:57.860
Fred, yours and mine, least regarded story, appeared in the same magazine with Cordwayner

15:57.860 --> 16:05.160
Smith's first fantasy book number six, Had Little Man on the Subway by Isaac Asimov and

16:05.160 --> 16:06.660
James McRae, who was you.

16:07.080 --> 16:12.900
And then the same issue of this semi-pro magazine was Scanners Live in Vane by Cordwayner Smith.

16:13.460 --> 16:15.540
For another eight years he didn't write anything.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.740
For another eight years he didn't write anything because nobody happened to read that magazine,

16:20.080 --> 16:21.620
which had a circulation of four.

16:21.660 --> 16:23.240
Well, didn't you get into writing again, Fred?

16:23.400 --> 16:27.580
I did reprint that story in an anthology I did a couple years later, which I think is

16:27.580 --> 16:30.800
the first time he ever reached more than four people with one story.

16:31.380 --> 16:36.800
And he didn't write more, I think, not so much because he didn't get feedback, but

16:36.800 --> 16:41.760
because I don't think he was aware of the existence of magazines to publish the stories.

16:41.760 --> 16:48.180
I don't think Paul Weinbarger, which was his real name, actually read very much science

16:48.180 --> 16:52.680
fiction uniquely among the good writers of science fiction I know.

16:53.100 --> 16:58.980
And it wasn't until editors like Horace Gold and A Little Later Myself began getting after

16:58.980 --> 17:01.800
him and urging him to write that he began producing in volume.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.220
How old was he when he died?

17:03.540 --> 17:05.200
In his middle sixties.

17:05.860 --> 17:11.840
His whole science fiction writing career, except for two stories, occupied about five

17:11.840 --> 17:16.220
years from about 59 to 64, I think it was when he died.

17:17.720 --> 17:23.340
During which time he produced a body of work that has as large a coterie audience as most

17:23.340 --> 17:24.960
writers who were writing for 40 years.

17:25.860 --> 17:29.680
Yeah, well, a lot of that, not all of it, but a lot of it is in print now, fortunately.

17:29.680 --> 17:37.760
And for the first time, his novel, North Australia, Old North Australia, which is a planet not

17:37.760 --> 17:38.560
located on Earth.

17:39.040 --> 17:43.740
North Australia is available in complete form, and it was previously chopped up into pieces

17:43.740 --> 17:44.360
and butchered.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.940
So he's really reaching his maximum audience now.

17:49.180 --> 17:56.340
Kurt Weiner Smith under his real name, Paul Weinbarger, was a specialist in Eastern affairs

17:56.340 --> 17:57.500
for the State Department.

17:58.280 --> 18:03.200
He'd been born, I think, in China and lived there for a long time and spent a lot of time

18:03.200 --> 18:04.320
commuting back and forth.

18:04.760 --> 18:10.960
Last year when I was traveling in Eastern Europe for the State Department, I went to

18:10.960 --> 18:15.820
a particular city where the American ambassador was known to be hostile to all writers and

18:15.820 --> 18:17.700
to science fiction writers in particular.

18:18.360 --> 18:22.860
And when I was introduced to the ambassador, I expected he had a hard time, but it turned

18:22.860 --> 18:27.340
out that he had been a student of Weinbarger's and he mellowed immensely.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.040
Two questions were then posed to the panel.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.020
What book would you most like to be remembered for?

18:46.480 --> 18:49.480
And what book by a colleague do you wish you had written?

18:50.180 --> 18:51.020
Isaac Asimov.

18:51.470 --> 18:56.620
If I'm going to be remembered, it's probably going to be for the Foundation trilogy.

18:57.200 --> 19:02.080
But what I would like to be remembered for is the second part of the Gods themselves.

19:02.700 --> 19:07.860
Because I have frequently been told I don't write any sex and that I don't write any

19:08.400 --> 19:11.880
extraterrestrials and I wanted to show the world I could write about extraterrestrials

19:11.880 --> 19:13.940
and wanted to show them I could write about sex.

19:14.400 --> 19:20.560
So I wrote the second part of the Gods themselves which was completely and 100% about extraterrestrial

19:20.560 --> 19:20.840
sex.

19:21.780 --> 19:27.940
And it was the best extraterrestrials ever anyone ever wrote about and the best extraterrestrial

19:27.940 --> 19:29.560
sex anyone ever wrote about.

19:30.120 --> 19:35.120
And if I have to be asked what story by somebody else I would really like to have written,

19:35.680 --> 19:43.640
it would be Neutron Star by Larry Niven because I once wrote an article about tides and when

19:43.640 --> 19:46.820
I saw this story for which he won a Hugo, I said to myself-

19:46.820 --> 19:47.060
And the Nebula.

19:47.060 --> 19:52.060
And the Nebula, I said to myself my goodness I could have written that story because I

19:52.060 --> 19:56.860
had the entire background in my article and I said to Larry Niven you know I could have

19:56.860 --> 19:59.600
written that story because I had the entire background in the article.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.540
He said I know I read the article that's right.

20:03.580 --> 20:04.460
Frederick Poe.

20:04.620 --> 20:11.840
If I were to choose one story to be engraved on my tombstone, it would have to be a big

20:11.840 --> 20:13.900
tombstone because I'd like to choose three.

20:13.900 --> 20:19.300
There's a short story called Day Million which I wrote so easily and painlessly that I've

20:19.300 --> 20:25.040
always been desperate to recapture that flow of inspiration that came out so quickly and

20:25.040 --> 20:25.340
happily.

20:25.980 --> 20:31.260
There's a novel called The Gold at the Starbow's End and there's a novel not yet published

20:31.260 --> 20:35.640
called Gateway which I think is the best of them all but it's 100,000 words so I don't

20:35.640 --> 20:37.760
know how much of it you can engrave on a tombstone.

20:38.560 --> 20:42.480
As for what other people have written that I wish I had written, there's a lot of H.G.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.380
Wells that I admire immensely.

20:45.500 --> 20:54.600
Novels and short stories that show a sort of ability not just to write well or to write

20:54.600 --> 20:58.180
interestingly but to invent whole new areas of writing.

20:58.340 --> 21:03.640
The time machine is a major invention and I wish I could have written something like

21:03.640 --> 21:03.900
that.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.060
Lester Del Ray.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.620
I find myself in a peculiar position on the second part of this.

21:08.620 --> 21:13.400
As to what I wrote, I don't in the first place expect to be remembered.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.840
Oh, I suppose some of my stuff will be remembered by people who read it while they were very

21:17.840 --> 21:21.800
young until 50 years after I was dead but I really don't think.

21:22.560 --> 21:26.720
If I wanted to be remembered, I wouldn't have picked a somewhat transient feel like science

21:26.720 --> 21:32.280
fiction where your stories inevitably do get out of date sometimes and well your chances

21:32.280 --> 21:36.920
of being remembered by the critics are smaller, used to be smaller than elsewhere.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.500
I'm not writing for the ages, I'm writing for my own pleasure and for the readers of

21:42.500 --> 21:48.620
the day and if they are happy with my things and if I enjoy what I'm doing, sufficient

21:48.620 --> 21:50.900
under the day is the good thereof as well as the evil.

21:51.940 --> 21:57.860
I suppose if I had to pick one story, just one, to be remembered, I'd be torn between

21:57.860 --> 21:58.320
two.

21:58.860 --> 22:04.560
Helen Law in spite of the fact it was my second story and a story I wrote for Fred Pole and

22:04.560 --> 22:06.780
that was for I am a jealous people.

22:07.320 --> 22:15.240
As to somebody else's story I wish I'd written, one small short story by a man named Joseph

22:15.240 --> 22:20.200
Caleum which most people have forgotten called when the eagles gather perhaps.

22:20.940 --> 22:25.360
But generally, I don't feel that way about other writers' work, I'm glad they wrote it,

22:25.440 --> 22:26.400
I enjoy it thoroughly.

22:27.280 --> 22:31.540
I find enough of their individuality in it as a rule that I don't want to.

22:31.620 --> 22:32.040
There is.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.700
Do you remember the last line of that story Lester?

22:35.560 --> 22:40.140
Is that the one that ended about it as a...

22:40.140 --> 22:43.400
No, no, no, that was a McFarlane story you're thinking of.

22:43.580 --> 22:49.660
The story of another man's that I wish I could write has not been written yet.

22:49.920 --> 22:55.340
That consists of the last three books which Isaac Hassamnoff has not written to finish

22:55.340 --> 22:57.040
up his foundation series.

22:58.260 --> 23:00.120
Well, she gave me the right to write.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.020
For the record I never did.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.100
For the record it's in print and on tape that you did.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.660
Which he now, being an Indian giver, has taken back.

23:11.980 --> 23:12.860
It blot!

23:13.400 --> 23:14.580
It blots somebody else's.

23:15.580 --> 23:16.540
Gordon Dixon.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.540
This is a hard thing for me to answer, not because I have any doubt about the answer,

23:20.660 --> 23:22.120
but it's fitting the category.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.860
See, I have absolutely no doubt about what I want to be remembered for.

23:25.860 --> 23:26.680
It's the child's title.

23:27.180 --> 23:30.000
But I am going to have to do the whole Blinken thing to do it.

23:30.240 --> 23:35.260
Because only if I do it right will it turn out to be a structured piece of fiction in

23:35.260 --> 23:36.120
twelve parts.

23:36.900 --> 23:41.160
Running through the historical framework, the contemporary framework, and into the future

23:41.760 --> 23:42.560
fiction framework.

23:46.240 --> 23:51.940
And also of a type that I firmly believe and hope has not been done before that I have

23:51.940 --> 23:53.460
labeled the conscious thematic novel.

23:54.660 --> 23:59.220
So, it will take me fifteen more years to do it and at the end of that time, if I've

23:59.220 --> 24:01.780
done it right it will come out that way and I want to be remembered for it.

24:02.260 --> 24:07.980
As far as I've got a different type of problem in choosing a book that I wish I had written

24:07.980 --> 24:12.900
because I have to sort of grab it random between about a dozen books.

24:14.040 --> 24:17.460
I've already mentioned Arthur's childhoods end.

24:17.460 --> 24:23.820
I picked Paul's Brainwave and I pulled one of my famous blankouts, Jontting.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.180
Alfie Bester.

24:26.420 --> 24:30.160
Alfie's Tiger, Tiger, or Star's My Destination.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.960
Star's My Destination is what I'm thinking of.

24:32.460 --> 24:36.000
But I can go on and name, as I say, eight to ten more.

24:36.540 --> 24:39.700
What I want from each one of them is one particular thing.

24:40.100 --> 24:44.400
See, I'd like to take the ring out of the idols I, or nose here, and you know, steal

24:45.320 --> 24:49.560
the jewel from its gown someplace else, this type of thing.

24:49.820 --> 24:54.160
It's difficult really for anybody, for me at least, and I think for most writers, to

24:54.160 --> 24:57.980
say what story of someone else's he wishes he had written.

24:58.140 --> 25:01.720
There are a lot of stories that are inordinately successful and I wish I had had stories that

25:01.720 --> 25:05.080
successful, which have been one award that I haven't won and so on.

25:05.660 --> 25:12.160
But the only thing any writer has to sell is his own individual personal point of view.

25:12.160 --> 25:18.100
And there would be no way for me to have written Nightfall, or the Foundation series, or Hell in a Law,

25:18.300 --> 25:22.920
or any of the great stories that I've admired so much, because they weren't my stories.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.020
The only stories I know how to write are mine.

25:26.140 --> 25:27.880
Settle for that, Fred. They're pretty good.

25:28.400 --> 25:34.960
I think that is generally true. I think that when we say, I wish I had written that, we do always see one thing in it.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.580
That's near and dear to our heart and we wish we'd had the chance to write the story about that.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.740
Can I end by telling you a little anecdote?

25:42.680 --> 25:43.600
Can we stop you?

25:44.100 --> 25:44.780
No, you can.

25:45.760 --> 25:53.060
Fred Paul and I, Isaac Asimov and Ben Bolver and Gordie Dixon were the few attached ladies.

25:53.280 --> 26:00.780
We're sitting around a single table in Toronto at the World Science Fiction Convention there, a couple years, 73.

26:01.780 --> 26:04.680
Agonizing, he had meal, I remember it well.

26:04.680 --> 26:12.760
Yes, I won the Hugo from the novel and Fred won it for the short story and Ben won it for editorship.

26:13.140 --> 26:19.360
And there they were, a series of Hugo's at the table and we all turned, well at least I turned to Gordie Dixon.

26:19.540 --> 26:21.340
I said, Gordie, you're disgracing us.

26:22.460 --> 26:23.660
And I hung my head.

26:23.940 --> 26:24.740
Yes, you did.

26:40.660 --> 26:44.780
This has been the Valentine Science Fiction Hour.
