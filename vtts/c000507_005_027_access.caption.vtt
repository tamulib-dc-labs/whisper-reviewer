00:04.402 --> 01:25.708
[Singing.]

01:37.450 --> 01:45.386
If you're sure haven't seen a reference, then I'm going to enjoy yourselves and we'll just enjoy it with you. We will be chanting about Bella, 
which means I love you, and we'll make you want to dance for 16th Century chanting. I'll point to that.

01:58.021 --> 04:47.142
[Singing.]

04:47.142 --> 05:17.638
[Moving around.]

05:17.638 --> 05:27.046
Attention...for spinning wheel, spinning wheel on earth, pulled by my beautiful colored yellow and gold gorgeous spinning wheel. It's the best one there 
is.

05:34.747 --> 06:34.364
[Singing.]

06:34.364 --> 06:46.364
[Applause.]

06:46.364 --> 06:50.489
I've never seen people like you who listen so beautifully. One of them would be bad. I love

06:52.191 --> 06:58.880
it. I just want to say that last year when they asked me to speak and I talked about money, I thought you ought to know that we did get to win at the 
research for Ireland and we earned $21,000 with some of their money.

07:20.536 --> 07:23.059
We do appreciate you so much. You're in and you're out. We've been so supportive. And you listen to the words. I think you're really so sensitive. 
All these people do really listen to the words. I know that's what you're listening to. Because you love

07:37.419 --> 07:42.206
language. And that's a beautiful thing. And we love it too. Go ahead and read.

07:58.100 --> 10:26.669
[Singing.]

10:26.669 --> 10:35.000
[Applause.]

10:35.000 --> 11:30.000
[Movement.]

11:30.438 --> 13:07.381
[Music.]

13:16.902 --> 13:19.966
This is a new book. It's a new every term. It's not a magical book, but they worked together.

13:36.528 --> 13:53.268
[Movement.]

13:53.268 --> 16:18.849
[Music.]

16:18.849 --> 16:32.973 
[Applause.]

16:32.973 --> 18:05.337
[Movement.]

18:05.337 --> 18:08.337
I had to marry this stressful man who doesn't make up a living for me. I expect I hate

18:08.317 --> 18:18.441
you, but it's not a problem. It's not a problem.

18:21.698 --> 18:47.098
[Singing.]

19:20.879 --> 19:29.806
[Applause]

19:29.806 --> 20:16.620
[Movement.]

20:19.047 --> 21:41.738
[Singing.]

21:41.738 --> 21:49.827
[Applause.]

21:56.635 --> 22:07.827
It was a lot for these guys.

22:15.974 --> 23:38.327
[Singing.]

24:00.802 --> 24:40.883
[Movement.]

24:40.863 --> 24:50.502
This all started because Lord Beagle is my old friend of 21 years, 20 years.

24:57.805 --> 25:00.849
That's the distinction, whatever that means. But my first recital in this area was with Lord Beagle, who is a mob of mobbers, which I don't think 
you know enough about, but he's a mob of sirenetics, and he queues at the Chevron Rocks. They're here to help himself, too, but back in 1912.

25:27.657 --> 25:29.700
It's not Phyllis. It's John Thomas. Fair Phyllis. Phyllis had a good time. And it took me too.

25:39.480 --> 26:52.514
[Singing.]

26:52.514 --> 27:00.000
[Applause.]

27:00.000 --> 27:16.190
[Movement]

27:16.235 --> 29:03.190
[Singing.]

29:03.190 --> 29:12.827
[Applause.]

29:13.647 --> 29:18.608
And our last one would be A Love Song Since First That's All Your Face by Thomas Gould.

29:18.608 --> 29:52.104
[Movement.]

29:52.104 --> 29:54.104
He's watching.

29:54.104 --> 30:44.407
[Singing.]

32:45.477 --> 33:09.200 
[Applause.]

33:09.200 --> 33:45.200
[Silence.]

33:45.200 --> 33:50.347
Emily, every year, puts together the group almost from scratch, if I understand this correctly. They come in here after having been singing 
together for about a month. These people sound better after a month than most groups I've heard after 10 years.

34:08.012 --> 34:12.979
As she already did us the favor of pointing out, one of the reasons that they're here is through Lloyd Biggle. All of us have our fannish charities. 
Conclave's fannish charity seems to be the Madrigal Singers.

34:25.040 --> 34:29.925
And one thing that we never really get a chance to do is thank you enough for what you do do. These people moved heaven and earth this year to 
reschedule so that they could be here. From what I understand, they performed all day yesterday, are exhausted and came here anyway.

34:51.788 --> 35:03.159
So one thing that you might want to pass on when you go out recruiting for new voices next year, as we travel around representing this convention, 
people will ask us lots of questions. They'll say, are you at the same hotel? What weekend are you on? But the one question we get more than

35:06.662 --> 35:10.305
anything else is, are you having the Madrigals again?

35:15.130 --> 35:21.576
So a thank you from all of us.

35:21.576 --> 35:30.753
[Applause.]

35:30.753 --> 36:34.574
...all these choirs were six, it can be a suspension six months out of the year...It was a long, long year...

36:34.574 --> 36:40.382
But anyway, thank you for taking your time.

36:40.382 --> 36:50.382
[Applause.]

37:53.599 --> 37:26.773
...people here don't know how wonderful it is to sing in that awesome place, singing all over the world, something their feet whenever you walk on 
and get to the place whenever they appear. That is something that we never resisted. We got to be the savers, and this is a very beautiful,

37:27.634 --> 37:29.056
wonderful place. And I'm going to be honest, I'm excited.

37:39.678 --> 37:46.507
Well, it's a few miles

37:46.527 --> 38:05.292
down the road from the school hall. Thank you for your support.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.023
Certainly.

38:10.023 --> 38:15.000
[Applause.]

38:15.000 --> 38:33.00
[Silence.]

38:33.00 --> 38:44.022
The chicken. Yeah, the chicken!

38:44.022 --> 39:21.907
[Movement.]

39:21.907 --> 41:30.068
[Singing.]

41:30.068 --> 41:37.000
[Applause]

41:37.000 --> 41:58.203
[Silence.]

41:58.203 --> 42:55.301
[Singing]

42:55.301 --> 43:00.000
[Applause.]

43:00.000 --> 43:25.160
[Silence.]

43:25.160 --> 43:27.223
Jeanette, we are now open to the public. Let them in.

43:27.223 --> 43:43.984
Land

43:31.308 --> 43:43.984
shark. Snow

43:45.727 --> 43:50.593
shark at confusion.

43:56.345 --> 44:18.589
Well

44:18.589 --> 43:56.345
[Movement and laughter.]

43:56.345 --> 44:18.589
I see they're pouring in. Well, you coming in, Roger?

44:29.420 --> 44:30.842
Well, we're not waiting for Roger. You're all welcome to come on in and have a sit. Yes, really honest, honest to true.

44:37.934 --> 44:38.995
Get your ass in here. All

44:39.055 --> 44:55.782
right, to do the introduction for our guest of honor is the Waldo Secretary and General Gadabout during the fur hat person, George Laskowski.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.024
I'll watch all the wine bottles back here. Sorry. It is not often that a man gets to introduce his favorite author at a banquet, and I am very happy 
to do this. Van has been my favorite author for some time. Now, how he became my favorite author is an interesting story in itself. I've been

45:24.966 --> 45:29.372
reading a lot of his works pretty much since I was reading science fiction. Now, it wasn't until I was studying for my master's degree in Latin. I 
was studying for the master's exams. I was writing my master's paper. I was doing work for other courses I was taking at the same time. And one of

45:43.693 --> 45:48.820
the courses was an examination of the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. Daedalus, of course, the artisan in Greek mythology. Now, I was trying to work 
in science fiction into a paper I was writing about Daedalus, the inventor. Naturally, I turned to the weapon shop stories of Van's. In the

46:10.287 --> 46:18.137
middle, it was about 11.30 at night, I picked up one against Eternity, also known as the weapon makers. I started scanning it to get some 
descriptions of weapons and things. I slowed down and about two and a half hours later, I finished the book again. I figured, I started thinking,

46:26.628 --> 46:30.653
well, He really captured my interest with this story, and I thought back about all the other stories he had written. The Silkie, you know, the, I 
got them in my notes here, yeah, Slan, you know, the totipotency novels are stories that he wrote, the ones with double minds, The Mixed Men, all

46:35.926 --> 46:54.447
these things, you know, and I just started thinking, All these ideas, you know, there's no other form of literature in which you get all kinds of 
ideas just pouring in all the time. And one of the most prolific persons with these ideas is Van. Well, now, well, just a few months ago I've been in

47:08.185 --> 47:16.236
contact with a fan out in Massachusetts, Sally Serralla. I told her that she should try one or two of Van's novels. And she did. It hooked her. She 
said, you know, why has she passed over after reading science fiction for so many years? How could she have missed someone so rich in ideas? Well,

47:38.234 --> 47:39.436
Think about this, too. The last time Van was guest of honor at a convention was just this past weekend. Prior to that, last year, he was in Brussels 
as a guest of honor. But before that, him and his now passed away wife, Edna Main Hall, were guests of honor in 1946 at the World Convention. How

48:02.686 --> 48:05.811
have we missed him in so long a time? And now we have him. He was here. He was in the Midwest at Cooley Con last weekend. He's here this weekend. He's 
at Wascon next weekend. This is his year. I'd like to present my favorite author, A.E. Van Vogt.

48:05.811 --> 48:35.677 
[Silence.]

48:35.677 --> 48:40.745
members of the committee, ladies and gentlemen, and slans.

48:45.392 --> 48:56.790
As George has said, this has been, for some reason or other, this last couple of years has been a lot of cons for me.

48:56.790 --> 49:40.190
[Silence.]

49:40.190 --> 49:42.793
Of course, hey, hey.

49:45.716 --> 49:51.101
An enormous number of people from France and surrounding countries.

49:53.964 --> 50:01.992
I just want to mention that as a starter, I want to explain my suit and my black outfit here. A few years ago, a friend of mine who was a producer said 
to me, Vanny said, we've got to get you some different clothes. He said, we've got to dress you up a little better than you've been dressing. So he

50:14.521 --> 50:25.724
took me to a tailor and I had the privilege of buying this then $500 suit at his recommendation from his tailor. Then, about three years ago, 
Somebody gave me this shirt and this tie. And I've not never worn it because I didn't know where to wear it, you know. But it seemed to me, finally,

50:37.073 --> 50:41.517
that a science fiction convention had to be the place.

50:44.380 --> 50:53.228
So, I would like to mention briefly something that I mentioned at the La Crosse Convention. I want to assure those people who are here from La 
Crosse that I will not repeat my speech. But I do want to mention a few things that were significant there. I mean, that were significant in

51:03.426 --> 51:10.574
connection with what I have to say, and those are going to be sort of duplicated. On the plane from Los Angeles to Chicago, O'Hare,

51:11.755 --> 51:27.653
there were two young men sitting behind me, and one of them said, I don't see how you can live on $11,000 a year, he said to his companion. and you 
know I mean that I hadn't really thought about that but that took me back to my time in when i had my first job ever during the depression and uh... i

51:36.728 --> 52:02.027
worked in the nineteen thirty one census for seventy five dollars a month that's what we were offered when we wrote the examinations in order to 
get the job and i was one of the people that passed although all return men from world war one had a ten point advantage over the other individuals.

52:06.060 --> 52:13.527
Nonetheless, of the 700 employed people there, I showed up as one of the employees for this $75 a month job. And then somewhere along there, the 
country was outraged by the high wages that civil service people were getting. And so the government cut everybody's salary by 10%. So we were

52:28.872 --> 52:35.381
down to $67.50, which, if you'll just consider that, $900. Now, ten years, almost ten years later, not quite that long, eight years later, when 
World War II began for Canada, which is where I am from,

52:54.387 --> 52:58.976
Some

52:54.387 --> 52:58.976
strange people here I see.

53:04.387 --> 53:16.210
I received apparently all that time the civil service had kept my name on file and they sent me a wire offering me a job in the Department of 
National Defense for ten hundred and eighty dollars a month. I mean a year of a year, pardon me, a year. So that, that it's, I think it was, it came to

53:23.648 --> 53:36.462
ninety dollars a month except that when I got there, it turned out that there were some deductions and I got eighty one dollars, you know. My rent 
was seventy five dollars. So that, by the way, just to show you what a craftsman I was by then, that did not bother me. That did not disturb me at all.

53:49.605 --> 53:52.693
I knew how to do something and I did it every every night after I got home from work. I wrote slang there and other things in the evenings. So, but I 
want to just consider that salary of that time and this man saying $11,000. How can you live on $11,000 a year? That tells us the level of inflation

54:12.788 --> 54:23.044
that has occurred, and yet there are costs that have not risen as much as those salaries that were being referred to there. For example, at that 
time, milk was 10 cents a quart. It is not now a dollar 20 a quart. Butter was 25 cents a pound during the Depression. It is not now three dollars a

54:33.801 --> 54:36.045
pound. So that if no one else, the farmer, has not had an increase in price corresponding to the increase in salary.

54:47.834 --> 54:55.248
So my impression is this, everybody today in these inflated times has more than we had then. Everybody. The salaries have gone up in proportion. 
Whenever the unions demand, you know, these high wages, et cetera, et cetera, these high increases, I'm all for it. Because everything is going

55:09.443 --> 55:26.687
to balance off, the prices are going to go up to some extent, but technology is doing something back here in connection with prices of goods and so 
on that is increasing the quantity of things that we get. for our extra money, even though the prices go up. So I'm willing for things to happen not

55:30.252 --> 55:55.240
quite as much as I saw advertised in a certain science fiction novel, whereby the description is given of New York in the year 2000, where a night 
at the New York Hilton cost $11,500. But

55:56.080 --> 56:02.067
my agent was away during the summer. He was on a cruise that included Leningrad and many North Seaports. And while he was away, his assistant sent 
on to me a contract from Italy in which I was offered for one book, a limited printing, one printing only. I can't remember what it was, like 4,000

56:22.472 --> 56:25.395
or 5,000 copies. 1,769,000 Italian lira. I didn't even ask, I just made sure that it was for just one printing, and what was named, you know, I 
mean, that the printing, that the wording was exactly, meant that exactly. And then I signed the contract, and I didn't inquire how much is a

56:42.024 --> 56:46.028
lira.

56:49.391 --> 56:54.657
I sent it back, I mean, I sent it on to the, he had to have it right away, he said, the agent did. Now, there would be a million lira advance payment on 
the signing of the contract. And I have no idea what that amounts to either. But I have a feeling it isn't that huge a sum. But this is the kind of a

57:08.646 --> 57:13.573
world that we seem to be moving into in the inflation. salaries, prices, salaries, prices, salaries, prices, and we can count a little bit on 
technology to keep those prices down a little better than the salaries. That would be my impression of the fact that everybody is better off

57:28.363 --> 57:33.631
today than they were during the Depression. I know of no one except, you know, like Rockefeller, you know, and so

57:33.911 --> 57:41.822
on.

57:46.797 --> 57:51.243
This past July, I was the recipient. For this past end of July, I was the recipient of probably the most fabulous invitation of my career. About 
two months before the end of July, I received a phone call from England.

58:13.274 --> 58:31.342
I was being invited, said the voice at the other end, to come to a convention, a computer convention at Nice, France

58:13.274 --> 58:31.342
for a solid week or approximately a week at the end of July, 1979. And I said, sir, you mean fabulous Nice? He said, Nice, France. The computer 
corporation that issued this invitation wanted a couple of science fiction writers to speak there, one from Britain and one from the United

58:41.354 --> 58:51.661
States. Now that surely is one of the best invitations you can have in the world as it is today. So now something happened there that was really 
fabulous not mice. I mean my speech went over very well. I mean I was I gave a speech titled inventing new worlds and It impressed a certain number

59:07.202 --> 59:23.967
of people there so that two of the managers of British Sperry Univac Corporation said to me separately if we were ever to offer you, if we were to 
offer you a job as an idea man for the corporation, would you accept? And I said, well, not right now, but maybe, you know, later on. So that was a,

59:38.181 --> 59:43.367
you know, that was a kind of a validation of the, of how well I did it. So now, but there was something better that happened there, something that is 
significant for all of you here today. There were two speeches delivered by Tony Buzan, the author of The Evolving Brain, a British, it's only

59:54.963 --> 01:00:23.603
been published in Britain so far, he described, you know, I had vaguely heard about this, the new discoveries about the two sides of the brain, 
but in Britain, this subject has been carried forward perhaps a little faster than here, and he described, and to have been invited there to give

59:54.963 --> 01:00:23.603
a talk on this, I mean, clearly the computer corporation wanted thoughts about, you know, for their people to listen to in connection with how to 
develop computers a little more, you know, and do something more with them and so on. The right side of the brain, said Dr. Buzan, is this side of

01:00:34.363 --> 01:00:53.269
art, music, painting, fantasizing, fantasizing.

01:00:54.295 --> 01:01:01.905
The left side of the brain is mathematics, logic, languages, reality. You know, the reality side. Now, I have no idea where in evolution we would 
acquire, you know, automatically an arched side of the brain. It seems now, doesn't it seem to you incredible that such a side of the brain would

01:01:14.423 --> 01:01:21.332
develop kind of evolutionary wise Who would need it? What would be the evolutionary purpose of a whole side of the brain being devoted to art? 
Here was the key thing. The more you stimulate or utilize one side of the brain, the stronger the other grows. In other words, the more you

01:01:43.792 --> 01:01:51.302
fantasize or deal with fantasizing or deal with art, the stronger your reality grows. The more you deal with reality and push at logic, push at 
languages, push at, etc., mathematics, the stronger the fantasizing, the arc side, the music side grows. That is a fantastic development and

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:25.356
in Britain, according to Dr. Buzan, they're going to change the entire educational system to deal with these discoveries in connection with 
how to balance the person through his educational years. Now, that seemed to me so fantastically wonderful to hear, because look at what we have

01:02:25.336 --> 01:02:32.987
been doing in science fiction. We have been emphasizing and stimulating the fantasizing side of the brain, and it is no longer surprising to me 
that tens of thousands of scientists today read science fiction in their youth. You see?

01:02:51.475 --> 01:02:56.422
They stimulated this side of the brain and the other side got stronger. Now, we have a look at just consider the problem, however, of the rigidly 
reality person who couldn't stand this other side over here. You know, I mean, the idea of fantasizing and so on. Yet we observe that many of these

01:03:07.577 --> 01:03:15.327
people have done a wonderful, careful control of that situation. They have become art collectors. They have become supporters of music 
associations. They have, you know, in other words, here is the, and I can even picture, because I once heard a woman say, John is all nuts and bolts

01:03:21.918 --> 01:03:32.236
at the office, but he's really a romantic at heart. Now, see, there we have that other quality moving in on him, and he's, he's balanced it off 
somewhere in that sense. Now, I can also understand why in years ago I read in a book that many, many, uh... business people show up in

01:03:46.943 --> 01:04:14.976
psychiatrists offices in their early forties and say doctor i don't know what's the matter i'm uh... i'm going crazy i've got all these crazy 
ideas going through my mind all the time now there they are they're fighting for reality and they're pushing at it so hard that the fantasizing

01:03:46.943 --> 01:04:14.976
side gets out of control well just consider that and we look at now we look at science fiction readers and writers. I had to look at myself because 
all these years I have been doing two things. I've been doing an automatic balancing system between these two. I mean automatic because I didn't

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.164
know what was going on. When people said to me, how come you can write all that crazy stuff and yet be so sensible?

01:04:41.517 --> 01:04:48.649
I say, well, what I have answered was, well, I early learned to distinguish between reality and imagination. It was a stabilizing sentence for 
me, because it was, and I made it, the more I said it, the more I meant it. But one thing I also observed, that I early developed a decision to do

01:04:57.063 --> 01:05:07.120
things systematically. In other words, here I was pushing at this incredible amount of fantasizing because I early also decided to let the 
fantasizing side in the last portion of a story go completely free. To write a portion of the story with a thought in mind that it could be that the

01:05:31.315 --> 01:05:48.784
Somewhere in the human brain is a an understanding of how the world really is and we have cut it off and buried it off And I wanted it to come through 
so that I would at it in the toward the latter half of a story My stories do not become scientific stories. They become fantasy Free association in

01:05:54.738 --> 01:05:56.640
connection with that story. I mean, I don't get away entirely from the basic concept of that story. Just let it happen. Now then, but on the other 
hand, I thought I tried to make everything I did professional. That's the reality side. You can see that I didn't know why I did it. I just did it.

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:24.677
When instead of, for example, when I became involved in Dianetics, it was through a series of theories that I had about how you, I would explain 
this during my interview at noon, so if you've heard it, bear with me for a moment. But the thought there was that after 10 years a writer needs to go

01:06:36.532 --> 01:06:49.866
back to the well or else he's doomed. Now it turned out to be this was not true of science fiction. I don't know why it turned out to be that, because, 
well I do know why, because I have a theory about that too.

01:07:03.643 --> 01:07:10.553
My science fiction sense, my science fiction, fictional sense, has a little hang-up in it. In other words, the reader has to make a contribution 
to each sentence. He has to fill in a little gap in each sentence. Now I turned out that I couldn't do it in every sense. Every once in a while you did

01:07:24.371 --> 01:07:26.714
have to say, yes, he said. Or some similar thing. But when I read McLuhan, that beautiful Canadian professor who had those great ideas on media, 
when I read him, I realized that here was why, in other words, science fiction is a hot medium, like radio. I was writing these sentences long

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.506
before he ever said that. I had decided that the fictional sense for science fiction has to have this little hang-up in it. So that the reader 
makes the contribution. In radio, the listener has to supply the picture because there's only the words and so on. And he called that hot, and he

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:17.098
called television as a cool medium. Now, just as an aside, when Professor McLuhan came on the scene, the New York advertising agency people were 
stunned. They felt as if they had missed something very important in their financial, you know, in their colossal businesses. And they invited

01:08:37.432 --> 01:08:44.503
him to give a speech to their annual banquet and paid him $35,000 for this speech. Among the people who attended the speech were a number of 
journalists, including Tom Wolf. If you know that name, you know that he is one of the most facile and brilliant journalists who writes in the

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:59.614
field today. He writes a very unusual sentence by all by himself that is delightful to read. Now he and a number of other reporters accompanied 
Professor McLuhan all around New York, including taking him to nightclubs. And one of the nightclubs that they attended was all the waitresses

01:09:15.513 --> 01:09:21.040
were nude. And they had also had these silicone injections so that when they leaned past you, this huge breast would brush your face and so on. 
Now, everybody waited for Professor McLuhan's reaction. And he said, he looked at them. He said, they're wearing us.

01:09:47.555 --> 01:09:53.665
Now, that may sound like an unusual, nobody could contest that statement, said Tom Wolf. Now, if you consider that for a moment, a husband wears 
his wife wherever he goes, even if she isn't there. an earth man going out into space will be wearing earth wherever he goes. And those waitresses

01:10:07.105 --> 01:10:12.173
were wearing their clients, so to speak. Obviously they were interacting, and that's what he meant by wearing. And that was quite a remark to 
make. Now, as I say, that is an aside. And

01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:35.673
I don't know what a waitress, whether what a waitress who is new does is on the art side or on the reality side.

01:10:39.099 --> 01:10:42.044
How does she come out of all this? Does she come out more real? Does she come out as a realist? as somebody who goes to the nearest psychiatrist. 
Doctor, I don't know what I've been doing all these years, but I probably need help.

01:11:07.195 --> 01:11:24.360
I

01:11:07.195 --> 01:11:24.360
just want to mention also that in that discussion on inventing new worlds, which the speech I gave in Nice, I pointed out that there's two things 
that we do in science fiction. that

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:30.980
we give options on the future. We have stories in which we look at different options, different ways that things could have gone, and we give the 
person a look at it, the reader a look at it, so that he doesn't have to go through it, except in reading it in three hours instead of living it for 70

01:11:32.142 --> 01:11:52.626
years when somebody, some power group that does it and will refuse to learn the lesson that it isn't working. They just persist in it and do it and 
so on. Now the other one is that we do what we invent a new planet with an ecology of its own and everything and man learns how to live there by some

01:12:01.354 --> 01:12:11.202
kind of a system. We have an example, Ringworld by Larry Niven and his forthcoming book is Ringworld Engineers which is being highly 
publicized. I received a a proof copy about a month ago and I just didn't have time to read it at that time and I called Holt Redfrew when I was in New

01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:52.363
York and I said do you still want a do you still want a a blurb about it from me when I get back to Los Angeles and they said yes if even if we can't use it 
on the cover we'll use it somewhere in our public publicity so they're really going to promote that book be prepared Ringworld Engineers is

01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:52.363
going to the publicized and advertised book.

01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:07.838
As another aside, so to speak, in my opinion, the future of science one of the futures of science lies in the new particles. These particles that 
are being discovered and have not yet been isolated enough for there to be streams of them created that can be used as beams or something when you

01:13:26.583 --> 01:13:40.216
get, when we get some of those particles in sufficient quantity under control, there's going to be some strange new developments that I think 
will compare to what happened with the laser beam. So,

01:13:40.356 --> 01:13:55.830
now, we come to this, what is this business of stimulating fantasy done to the people who read and write science fiction. The best person for me to 
look at has been myself, naturally.

01:14:09.373 --> 01:14:11.917
I look at the kind of things that I have done. First of all, I learned to write systematically. I learned to write by a system. I didn't create the 
method. I merely learned a method that was a system method and thereafter I was a craftsman. I still get novels from writers who tell me that they

01:14:28.323 --> 01:14:34.749
have written their novel in three weeks. Well, this flabbergasts me because it takes me three weeks or more just to go over a story once I have 
finished it, to go over it line by line by line to make sure that that it's okay. When I wrote The Violent Man, it came out at 200,000 words. A total

01:14:56.197 --> 01:14:58.342
nightmare, I can tell you that. 200,000 words took me four years to write that book. It's a non-science fiction book. So I decided it's too long, 
and I cut 40,000 words out by reading each paragraph and stroking out words and phrases and sentences, and then doing the same with the next

01:15:05.504 --> 01:15:21.580
paragraph and so on down the line until it was reduced to 160,000 words. And I thought, I will never write another novel of 160,000 words. But it 
seems to have gone on, although it was badly handled at the beginning. The pocketbook reissued it last year. and they seem to be quite willing to

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:37.314
continue it.

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:46.850
By the way, between La Crosse and Conclave, I went to New York. My purpose was to see what is going on in the New York publishing field because you 
can't really tell it clearly from from Los Angeles. See, these are all in people there in New York. They know each other. How can anybody ever

01:16:01.679 --> 01:16:04.222
break into such a field? I don't know. It probably happened because it happened to me. Just imagine, there I was in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, 
way back in the 1930s, and I send a science fiction story in 1939,

01:16:08.768 --> 01:16:23.807
somewhere after July 1939, to a magazine called Astounding, and I get a check. If you read Fred Paul's account of that period of time, I couldn't 
have happened with any other magazine of Science Fiction Magazine in New York at that time, because they were in groups. The editors and

01:16:43.064 --> 01:16:47.630
writers, the editors bought from their writer friends. There's something of that order. It was hard to break into. But I sent it to the right 
place. And that's what happened. Now the same thing happened earlier when I sent stories to McFadden Publications True Story magazine. They

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:02.704
bought my first story. And so there is the publisher wants to make money. He is not in on these editorial writer conspiracies to buy in and in from 
an in-group. The publisher is in there to get the best thing out that he can and to get the most buyers for his magazine book and so on. But you cannot

01:17:22.036 --> 01:17:25.924
escape. from the thought that the best place to live if you're a writer is New York. Bear this in mind. If you really decide to do it, you're a short 
distance away. Don't just commute. Go there for a short time and stay there and get acquainted.

01:17:44.191 --> 01:17:53.565
Find out what's going on and impress a few people with what a good personality you have.

01:17:57.190 --> 01:18:22.287
The future of the individual,

01:17:57.190 --> 01:18:22.287
of the human person, I evolved two systems on a realistic basis for dealing with the problems of human beings, which I won't go into here, but they 
took quite a while to do. And then I observed something else. In other words, it takes me a long time. But I'm talking now about something that

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.826
happened automatically. Over here, I was stimulating the fantasizing side. And over here, I was looking at the world. at people, at things,

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:51.015
at solutions that other people had found and finding slightly variations of those or different solutions. And in 1973,

01:18:51.996 --> 01:18:59.748
I took my wife on a trip through Canada. The reason for the trip was that I wanted

01:19:05.568 --> 01:19:10.896
Her doctors had told me she was a terminal case and I wanted her to see her family. You make a last visit to all the members of her family. She didn't 
know that she was a terminal case. She was in good shape for a while at that time. Now,

01:19:21.252 --> 01:19:31.027
what I had been telling her for some years was that I wanted to make such a trip through Canada for another reason. I had observed that people who go 
back to high school reunions after 40 years, a percentage of them die within the year. I wanted to test that out. I wanted to go back and see a number

01:19:46.027 --> 01:19:52.737
of people whom I had not seen for over 40 years And I wanted to see what happened to me and what I thought while I was looking at them and so on. And this 
was what I told her was the real purpose of the trip, whereas it was really something I was not going to do to

01:19:58.682 --> 01:20:12.194
veil the purpose which was for her to visit her family. So nonetheless, I did all these things because that's what I had said we were going to do. 
And I visited my two childhood homes. in a small town or village called Neville, Saskatchewan, Canada, where I'd spent the first ten years of my

01:20:23.851 --> 01:20:31.623
life. And I went to the house where we had lived the last four years and it was in better condition than when we left it. Now how can that be? There it 
stood, beautiful, rehabilitated in some way, evidently made a wonderfully good wood, you know, to have survived that long. And then I went to

01:20:52.437 --> 01:20:56.855
the town of Morden, Manitoba, Canada, where we had lived in a wonderful house. I mean, it was really, my father who was an attorney had somehow got 
hold of a stone house that had been built by a Scottish MD who had duplicated a Scottish palace. I mean, he made it a little smaller, you know. But it

01:21:13.041 --> 01:21:18.291
had a turret and, you know, it was three stories and it stood there and so on. And we lived in that colossal place and it was kind of chilly upstairs. 
because of those big rooms and the big hallways. And by the way, the MD passed away, and the house fell into the hands for taxes of the town. And my

01:21:35.453 --> 01:21:42.539
father somehow got hold of it, and there's where we lived during that period of time as we were in that town. Well, it was still standing. So I took 
pictures of that. And I went to, I mean, I'm just now talking about the scenes. And then I went I went and talked briefly to two cousins whom I had not

01:21:54.470 --> 01:22:01.398
seen for 40 years. Now, that seems incredible, but when you move to the United States, it's as if you disappear. So,

01:22:06.885 --> 01:22:12.772
for Canadians, I mean, you vanish from the Canadian scene. And so, anyway, one of these cousins, I had come to my hotel room in Vancouver, British 
Columbia. he was two years older than me and he had the last time I'd seen him he was 17 and I was 15 whatever that I mean something like that well I

01:22:22.702 --> 01:22:45.756
noticed that the thing that happened as I looked and as I looked at him standing there just when I opened the door was that first of all he reminded 
me of his father and so on and I kept doing a rapid shifting in my mind over the way he had looked and the way he looked now. The way he had looked, the

01:22:51.161 --> 01:22:52.201
way he looked. I mean, a rapid shift back and forth like that. So I noticed that. And at a later time, I did the same thing with a cousin. I visited her 
in the place where she worked.

01:23:08.577 --> 01:23:14.342
She said to me, your father's sister and your half-sister It lives just down the street. This is in Swiftern, Saskatchewan, Canada. It lives 
just down the street. Would you like to go and see them? And I said, if they're still speaking to me two or three years from now, yes. But, I mean,

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:28.277
then. I will see them then, but not now, because I felt as if I cannot afford to see too many. I didn't say this. I didn't explain what I was doing. 
These two women had been very good to me, but I hadn't seen them for over 40 years. There was a lot of The theory would be that there's a lot of trauma

01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:51.341
in those early years, a lot of childhood illnesses that could be stirred up, you know, and that kind of thing. That was my theory. And just to 
shorten this thing somewhat, when I went home, I started to do my dream therapy again and it wouldn't work. I wanted to do it on my childhood, on

01:24:04.138 --> 01:24:07.323
these childhood, it wouldn't work. I was sick every morning that I tried it. Every morning I woke up sick. So I abandoned it and I haven't done it 
since. That's 73. I'm going to start again when I get back to Los Angeles because I have completed all my book contracts and I handed the last book

01:24:16.837 --> 01:24:28.610
over to my agent the day before I left Los Angeles. I was long overdue because when my wife passed away, I had four book contracts and I added one to 
it foolishly in the interim there. And they were overdue, overdue, overdue. One was due in October 1975, and I delivered it last month.

01:24:54.065 --> 01:24:56.889
And the others were earlier contracts. And one of them was Renaissance. came out from Parker Book recently. Another one is coming out in 
February 1980 from Double Day. I called it, the universe ended 1704 A.D. and they're calling it the cosmic encounter.

01:25:20.955 --> 01:25:24.821
Now the reason I chose 1704 A.D. for the universe to end is that it was the time of Queen Anne Now my wife was fascinated by Queen Anne because Anne 
was she considered the best English Queen that ever lived. That was her feeling. I used to hear Queen Anne came over the breakfast table to me, you

01:25:40.814 --> 01:25:49.285
know, off and on for years as my wife read more and more of this book about her and so on. What Anne did finally, there were many wars going on that the 
British were constantly involved in. One day she just said, bring all the armies back from Europe to heck with all that. I don't want to have any

01:26:00.218 --> 01:26:01.620
more wars. And these macho British males of that period were stunned, but she had the power and they brought them back to their, you know, they 
were totally disgraced by and were glad when she finally passed away so as they could resume all those wars.

01:26:20.107 --> 01:26:25.395
But Anne had this, that she did that and nobody else ever, Elizabeth didn't dare to do that. She never thought of, you know, breaking off anything 
on that. She wouldn't have dared to oppose those great men. I mean, some of these men that were, you know, there was a word for the for the brilliant

01:26:35.995 --> 01:26:39.060
Englishmen around these queens. The golden lads, you know, it was really, anyway, that was an interesting period of history to me because I got 
it over the breakfast table for so long that I utilized it as the place where the universe collapsed into. So, no. And because I now knew a lot about

01:26:54.746 --> 01:27:01.497
it and I only had to make certain studies to verify detail, you see. Now,

01:27:02.033 --> 01:27:13.008
I'm just telling you these things to show where my reality went, you know, what I got stimulated. I've got to be a personal example, because I've 
stimulated my brain on the fantasy side as much as anybody in the world. That's got to be true, because I've written approximately 50 books, you

01:27:21.821 --> 01:27:25.746
know. And you cannot do it from more than that. Well, Isaac Asimov, of course. But then, you know what Isaac is doing? Science fiction, then a 
science article. Science fiction, then a science article. He's been bouncing back and forth. And in the course of all this, he has maintained

01:27:42.802 --> 01:27:47.266
his sense of humor, shall we say. And he has become one of the world's greatest speakers. And if there's such a thing as past lives, Isaac is the 
reincarnation of Adolf Hitler as a speaker. Now look, now look, I'm sorry to say it that way, but never have I heard a man speak so vibrantly, I

01:28:03.569 --> 01:28:13.326
mean, except a Hitler. As a speaker, I said. not as a not as a person because Isaac is a great man now but this as a speaker he can reach he doesn't need 
this microphone he doesn't need this microphone even if this hall was you know another of 400 yards you for have you heard him speak I mean when he

01:28:14.984 --> 01:28:40.722
really lets himself go it's incredible isn't it So I've never heard anybody else like that, except mind you, some of those early English 
orators, Lloyd George, they spoke in that, because of course they had no microphones like this, they spoke in this fashion, you know, that they

01:28:41.123 --> 01:29:04.653
were vibrant speakers and they extend, I don't know how they do it, and retain their, you know, are able to know what they're saying. Because I 
said to Isaac in Toronto, I said, Isaac, I said, I listened to you and by golly, not only were you delivering your talk in that wonderful fashion, I

01:29:09.355 --> 01:29:21.711
said, but you even made sense.

01:29:25.876 --> 01:29:28.880
He says, I don't know whether I like that or not. I said, it's praise. It's praise, I said, because I was greatly impressed. A few years ago, after I 
finished my exercise experiment, I got interested in languages. And as usual, presently, I did it professionally. I did something

01:29:48.538 --> 01:29:50.279
professional about it. But my first of all, I just got interested in languages in connection with, I bought tapes and records and transformed 
them to a, finally to a cassette that I could take out with me when I was walking my dog for 40 minutes. And they weren't right for what I wanted. So I

01:30:10.873 --> 01:30:13.798
invented a new method of learning languages. It took me a while. A

01:30:15.041 --> 01:30:20.591
method which I've been able to copyright. I'm the only person in the United States who has been able to copyright a language system. They don't 
ordinarily allow a copyright on language, because after all, as they wrote me first, they said, anybody who can speak a language can speak a

01:30:27.807 --> 01:30:36.080
language. You know, I mean, it's not a special art or anything like that. So I pointed out to the difference, and presently, they allowed me to 
copyright my tapes. So, just tell you what I did. Just consider that. Over here, all this fantasizing, building up the reality side, and I'm just

01:30:51.481 --> 01:30:59.470
looking at the language business, you know, just looking. What is it I'm learning here? I was in no hurry. You know, the first ad I put in for, I 
discovered I couldn't use these tapes, took too long to transform them, you know, to what I wanted. So I put an ad in the Los Angeles Times, which

01:31:09.741 --> 01:31:13.525
read, writer would like for non-commercial taping, and that's what it really meant at that time, people who speak Frisian, Flemish, Low 
German, Basque, Walloon, Yiddish, Rhaeto-Romantic, and a couple of others. And about nine o'clock on Sunday, I got an answer from a Frisian woman

01:31:29.536 --> 01:31:43.970
who said that she and her sister had kept the language alive from the time they got to the US around age 20 by speaking to each other, speaking it to 
each other on the phone. At about noon, a part-time Flemish professor at USC called. Oh, he said, we'll pay $10 an hour. Pardon me. That's

01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:55.862
included in the ad. We'll pay $10 an hour.

01:32:00.299 --> 01:32:11.553
at four o'clock, an architect who spoke low German

01:32:00.299 --> 01:32:11.553
called, and I made an appointment with him. At 10 o'clock at night, the phone rang again, and there was a man's voice, and he said, I've been in this 
country for eight years. He said, I've never even seen the word Rhaeto-Romantic before here. He says, I speak the full land version of

01:32:22.987 --> 01:32:25.851
Rhaeto-Romantic. I said, don't hang up. Just imagine out there in that vast city of Los Angeles, somebody at the end of a phone line who had taken the 
trouble to call me. Anyway, I discovered later that language people do move because I was just recording this on some pretty good home equipment

01:32:37.912 --> 01:32:47.042
except for one thing. There's essentially no cars pass where I live except when I'm recording. Airplanes do not go over very often except when 
I'm recording. It was an amazing set of coincidences. And so I hear this roaring car go by on my tapes and I thought, boy, I better go to the

01:33:00.949 --> 01:33:08.848
professional studio. what my system is. Let me just tell you what I worked out there with my dog up in those hills of Hollywood, a language system 
like this. It's so simple, you would think that it could have been devised before, except that I'm sure that the people who teach languages

01:33:23.233 --> 01:33:34.483
normally are native speakers who are very realistic about it. They grind it into you, rather than think about what a solution should be, and 
they've been doing this for centuries. Now, German, English, German, English, German, English, 15 sentences, and then only the German as an

01:33:44.436 --> 01:33:56.113
immediate test on the conversation tape. On side two, I mean this goes on and on, and right near the end I give the number

01:33:56.674 --> 01:34:05.987
system and the alphabet. because you really should know what those are. And then on side two, the same sentences as on side one, with every word 
spelled aloud and a literal translation. And that's where I discovered what one of the problems is. Getting a literal translation out of a

01:34:22.776 --> 01:34:26.080
native speaker is not easy. He says, it doesn't make sense that way. And in spite of everything, in spite of the fact that I finally persuaded them 
to do it, I'm sitting there listening to the recording in the studio and I hear my native speakers say seven words and give me a three-word English

01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:51.760
translation and I wave at the engineer, stop. And so in spite of my attempts etc. I say well now sir you spoke seven words in your own language and 
only three in English is what doesn't I said look we've been over that we've been over that before you know it's the come to those kind of sentences

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:27.628
where you say it nothing now means here you know I mean that's the way it is in the in the say it is in another language and it means nothing here you 
know something like that so But you should really know those sentences if you're going to learn a language. You should know those words if you're

01:35:33.049 --> 01:35:35.291
going to learn a language. You can go over side one again and then sort of remember what those words are and then you learn them. I discovered it 
took about three weeks or 40 minutes a day to learn to get one of those languages in my ears without attempting to speak them. There's another

01:35:52.150 --> 01:35:55.894
thing I observed which I'm sure has not been observed. I mean, I know it has not been observed that there are two types of persons in the world in 
terms of language learning. The mimic type, the mimic actor type, and of course everybody has observed that this person can speak a sentence in a

01:36:03.406 --> 01:36:14.745
foreign language without knowing what it means. He can speak it exactly and precisely. But

01:36:17.069 --> 01:36:34.278
there's a whole set of reality in what happens with him, too, because I talked to a number of such persons who had learned foreign languages and 
then used them only occasionally, which is the typical, which is the American way. I mean, we don't have much chance to use foreign languages.

01:36:37.066 --> 01:36:41.191
This man had occasion to go to Mexico City about every three or four months. And when he arrived in Mexico City, I'm talking now about a former 
actor who was a mimic type who spoke, you know, so on. When he arrived in Mexico City, he spoke Spanish. He ordered a, he called a taxi. He did this

01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:58.590
and he did that. He spoke all these words and so on. And when they spoke back to him, he couldn't understand the word they said. It took him two or 
three days before that hearing ability returns to the mimic type of person. You know, a lot of language that he knows. So, but the other type, the

01:37:15.356 --> 01:37:32.723
95% of us who are those dullards in the classes who do the job and after, who go through classes and learn our languages sufficiently so that we 
pass the examinations and then leave and never use it again. That's the 95 percent. That is the person who should learn the language only in his

01:37:35.356 --> 01:37:39.441
ears and not try to speak it. But there is no connection between the ears and the voice box in that direction. There is no connection. You cannot, 
after you have learned one of those tapes, you know, all the stuff in one of those tapes so that when you recognize every word in it, or, well, I

01:37:46.331 --> 01:37:58.647
never, I never worried about recognize every word. I learned about, from between 95 and 98 percent was sufficient for me. Otherwise, I would 
never have gone on, been able to go on to the next tape, you see, because there's always something that doesn't stick with you. So, if somebody

01:38:10.628 --> 01:38:20.422
says to you, well, what is the word, as one person did, what is the word for thank you in Norwegian? And I say, I have the faintest idea. I said, but I 
thought you told me that you'd listen to some Norwegian tapes. Yes, that's true. But I also told you that I don't speak the least. But not even

01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.742
thank you, he said. So the next morning, I hadn't listened to the Norwegian tape for some years. I took it out and I recognized 95% of it. And I 
discovered then that the word for thank you in Norwegian is tak, T-A-K. So I've never forgotten that. But now, my second tape is of vocabulary

01:38:49.936 --> 01:38:57.503
tape. I'll come to the good part of this in a few more. The second tape is a vocabulary tape whereby I just spell the word, pronounce it, and 
translate it. And then do the test every 15 words or so. Only the German and so on and on through a two-hour tape. A two-hour tape will add about

01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:28.165
1,400 words to your vocabulary. And when you know, when you recognize all of those words during the test, you're in pretty good shape so far as the 
meaning of those words because you can spell them. And when you can spell a word in your ears, you can read it. you read it automatically at that

01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:43.553
point. Now, I don't know why there's a connection between the ears and the eyes and none between the ears and the voice of that 95% of us poor 
non-mimic types, but that's the thing that I have observed. Now, I put one small ad about this. Since I started to do, since I'm, as I say, always

01:39:58.898 --> 01:40:04.688
professional, I was not that concerned about doing anything. I hired a part-time secretary, but one small add in one magazine and there is a 
certain response from that over the years which has gotten me a feedback and among the people who wrote me were the people who put out the audio

01:40:07.953 --> 01:40:23.287
forum tapes. That was formally one other company but then there was a second company that has taken it over. The Jeffrey Norton Publishers 
Incorporated in New York City and when I was in New York this past week this past week, I went over to see them. He called me long distance and asked

01:40:39.699 --> 01:40:42.722
me to come and see him. And they had already put four of my sets of tapes in their catalog. And he says, we are getting orders like we have seldom 
gotten on this on the way we are describing these tapes. So I went over there and it is a cassette nightmare over at Geoffrey Norton Publishers.

01:41:04.382 --> 01:41:06.023
That's what they're publishers of. They published 3300 different educational tapes, including the audio forum tape, which is the language 
system of the State Department.

01:41:19.985 --> 01:41:25.650
When they first contacted me, I got hold of the high German version. They call it the German. They're not distinguished between all those German 
dialects.

01:41:34.808 --> 01:41:47.988
the architect who spoke low German said to me that low German was in the 12th and 13th century the language, the commercial language of the North 
Sea, that is of the Hansianic League. Now that was an interesting thought to me. I had not thought about that. So I concentrated a little bit more

01:41:52.115 --> 01:42:01.930
on low German than on other languages. So about a year ago, when my agent had a visitor from Sweden, a publisher came, and my agent invited a number 
of writers to have dinner with this publisher. And at the end of the meal, I said to this publisher, Kastu Plattitschräder, can you low German

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:18.548
speak? And,

01:42:20.330 --> 01:42:30.043
yo, yes,

01:42:20.330 --> 01:42:30.043
Oberexi Plattutsch. He pronounced the name of the language differently. Now, I said dialects within dialects. But it's interesting that a 
Swedish publisher living in Stockholm would have this as a sub-language sitting there after all these hundreds of years. How would he have

01:42:47.434 --> 01:42:51.401
learned, you know, what would have been the motivation for learning that language? Now, I don't know how true this is of the whole North Sea 
because they, because the Hanseatic League went all the way up into Russia, you know, up into the, those Russian ports. So it would be

01:43:02.086 --> 01:43:20.314
interesting, and by the way, Low Germanism is similar to Yiddish, which is not surprising in view of the fact that the

01:43:02.086 --> 01:43:20.314
Jewish people have a very commercial instinct, et cetera, and they would have been in all those sea ports doing their business too. And it could 
be that that's where Yiddish started. I wouldn't be totally surprised that some variation of Yiddish came out of that period of time. I know

01:43:37.342 --> 01:43:41.386
nothing about the history of Yiddish, I must say, though.

01:43:43.588 --> 01:43:46.511
Anyway, here I am. I'm going to get wild. It's just as if I've written another book. another science fiction book. I'm going to get royalties on 
languages on a new language system. I have about, in fact, I have 65 two-hour masters, two-hour language masters. My theory is that there are

01:44:08.216 --> 01:44:16.626
over 200 languages in the Los Angeles area, and I'm going to find them all. When I get, you see, I've now finished my book contracts and I'm going to 
go to Radio Station KPFK and back in, which is a Pacific Corporation, it's a sort of a public supported station. It's a radio station. And I'm

01:44:35.646 --> 01:44:40.352
going to ask them if I can go on the air and look for these languages. It should be an interesting experiment, and as a matter of fact, one of the 
great linguists that I met as a result of putting that little ad in that one magazine is

01:44:41.159 --> 01:44:58.729
a professor of comparative linguistics, born in Vienna, speaks 20 languages fluently, And a number of other languages, he said, oh, I can get 
along in the streets, he says.

01:45:07.733 --> 01:45:13.699
But he wouldn't record them for me because he didn't know them the way you have to know a language in it, so that kind of thing. But I don't mean he 
recorded all these languages for me because I already had some before I ever met him, et cetera. But he can explain a language. He can, in other

01:45:26.468 --> 01:45:34.939
words, now he does have, there's the Japanese tapes that he made for me. An American professor teaching in a Japanese university ordered these 
tapes and he wrote me, he said, you'll be interested to know what my educated Japanese wife thought of these tapes. She thinks that what you have

01:45:49.058 --> 01:45:56.087
there is that the speaker, translator, the person who's speaking the language, is a Japanese-American who speaks a very elegant Japanese, but 
he has a few old-fashioned words that are no longer used in the Japanese current language. And as a

01:46:13.467 --> 01:46:25.163
matter of fact, this professor had been in Japan about 15 years before he recorded those tapes. And he was back at the time that I got the letter. He 
was in Japan translating scientific papers for a Japanese university laboratory from eight European languages into Japanese. So

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:48.952
he was now getting current with the current usage of certain words, which were missing. And a Chinese woman, get this, a Chinese woman listen to 
his Chinese tapes, Chinese tapes. She says, he speaks the language very fluently. You know, I mean, this was the only one where there was a slight

01:47:02.964 --> 01:47:07.974
criticism that counted with me. He speaks the language very fluently. He knows the structure and grammar better than I do, she said. but it's as 
if an Englishman who has been living in America for many years but still has a slight English flavor in his voice, speaking Chinese. But what he

01:47:27.726 --> 01:47:42.687
can do, he knows the United Nations way of spelling the words, he knows the way of that person who did that study of Chinese back in 1880 and he knows 
the current government you know the current Chinese spelling method where did he learn all this I mean it's an amazing talent that this person

01:47:43.544 --> 01:48:05.063
had well anyway I'm just saying I ran into this man and he's leaving for Europe to retire he's 70 years of age still looks 50 but but he's going back 
to Europe next this this coming spring And he thinks he's going to retire to one of the Mediterranean islands because they're so beautiful, you

01:48:05.397 --> 01:48:12.829
know, that kind of thing. So now,

01:48:12.849 --> 01:48:23.406
where am I?

01:48:24.196 --> 01:48:27.584
Well, I don't know whether I have his permission to give his name. I think I better not under those circumstances. I mean, he was born in Vienna and 
one of the things that as soon as I discovered that I said, do you speak Vietnamese German by any chance? And he said, yes. I said, well, you know,

01:48:38.348 --> 01:48:42.778
Vienna being such an old, wonderful historical city. Why don't we record three two-hour Viennese German tapes and record the Viennese 
language, which we did. So I've got that one. So the back in 1964, the reason I'm going to go to KPFK, back in 1964, KPFK asked me to give a number of

01:48:52.282 --> 01:49:10.487
talks on their station on my current ideas which is about things, and it just so happened that I had a number of current ideas at that time of an 
original time. I was just at that time writing or preparing, considering what were the qualities you had to have to make and keep money. And the

01:49:37.957 --> 01:49:45.744
reason I was doing that was because three individuals that I had gone to school with in Canada had all got rich there. And I always thought I was the 
smartest person to graduate from that. And so I thought, well, I knew them when. I knew these characters when. And they must have had shown those

01:49:54.552 --> 01:49:57.955
qualities at that time. So over a period of about three years, I thought, now, what could this be? And I finally thought of this thing, and this 
thing, and this thing. And I gave five talks of my 12 final qualities on

01:50:07.707 --> 01:50:16.977
KPFK and asked for people's opinions. I wanted feedback from it. And I got very interesting comments. Then I gave eight talks on my systematic 
thought about women, which I had also devised over the, as a result of writing a novel called The Violent Man, in the, in the violent man I

01:50:34.758 --> 01:50:41.578
described the behavior of two women without understanding what those women were up to. I said to, and in fact for three years I went around to all 
together about 400 persons, men and women, I said, what were those women doing? How would you explain what those women did? Because that's out of

01:50:55.097 --> 01:50:56.259
life. I saw that happen in life. I actually saw those two women do that, two different women do that. Now, what were they doing? So most women 
professed, they had the faintest idea what women were up to. You know, one high school teacher of languages said to me, women are pure creatures

01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:19.960
who have to live in a world of men. And

01:51:21.443 --> 01:51:35.764
by the way, that wasn't too bad an answer because basically the system that I finally devised did take into account the fact that that women have 
developed four normal ways of four normal conditions that they go into in relation to maintaining status with men. And that's got to have a long

01:51:48.522 --> 01:51:55.731
history, a tremendous history behind it, evolutionary wise. So then I gave five talks on my violent male, my the male that I describe in The 
Violet Man. Now the only thing that my publisher, the hardcover publisher for our Strauss, had against my novel The Violet Man, when they

01:52:09.371 --> 01:52:28.255
published it, the editor wrote me, he was very concerned, he said, it is a dangerous thing for a writer to try to teach anybody anything in a novel. 
You know, it should not be an obvious statement about a new system. And he said, we'll publish it. I said, I don't know how to change that. I said,

01:52:39.349 --> 01:52:41.436
because this is exactly what it is. So he says, we'll publish it. And the only thing that went wrong with the hardcover edition was that the 
salespeople had never heard of me. And so they placed, let's say, five books in New York City, ten books in Los Angeles because ten of my friends

01:52:50.382 --> 01:53:01.199
ordered them in advance. And that was all the books that they were in Los Angeles. while the promotion department had hired a promotion person in 
Los Angeles area who put me on television, on radio, got me talks, and so on, all to promote this book, and there wasn't a single book available for

01:53:06.768 --> 01:53:21.543
three months. So that was death for that hard cover, but it then went to paperback at Avon and went through seven printings, and Parkett Book has 
reassured it. So, no, but I was glad that I was given that opportunity to explain these three different sets of ideas on KPFK way back there. And,

01:53:45.247 --> 01:53:51.333
you know, they invited writers to do these kind of things, which is very interesting. Naturally, we were not paid, but I'm going to try to do the 
same thing with finding these languages, the rest of these languages. There must be every Indian language in the United States, spoken in Los

01:53:57.595 --> 01:54:03.022
Angeles. Somebody goes home and he speaks to his family. He speaks the language from one of the Indian backgrounds. And the same way with all the 
dialects that have come to this country, those dialects are spoken. And I'm going to record them all. Now that's quite a, I've spent $40,000 up to

01:54:19.141 --> 01:54:24.868
now, approximately. So you can see that it's It's quite an investment in terms of, let's say, research. But apparently now it is going to pay off 
because Jeffrey Norton, when I went up to his office, he had a drink for me, and we sat and talked for about two hours. His girlfriend from McGraw

01:54:48.837 --> 01:54:54.704
Hill Publishing Company came in, and we sat and talked for a little longer. And then I said, well, I better let you two people go back. They were 
going to go to dinner. And I called up Norman Spinrad and said, I am free. Can you still come over? He was not feeling well. Can you still come over

01:55:09.389 --> 01:55:11.636
and have dinner with me? He had dinner, but he hadn't had any dessert, so he came over and he had a salad and a dessert and coffee and we talked until 
11 o'clock at night. So these are some of the things that have happened to me in this world and it's interesting to me that when after I listened to

01:55:22.546 --> 01:55:36.857
that talk in Nice by that author of that evolving brain, everything seemed to fall into place for the first time in my life and I had no explanation 
for why fantasizing that reading science fiction had convinced all those scientists to become scientists and so on. I think we're looking at a

01:55:57.463 --> 01:56:03.570
tremendous discovery here and so At La Crosse, Mike Lixon, the fan guest of honor,

01:56:03.989 --> 01:56:14.964
spoke on the subject, now folks, he says, you are not slands, he said. We've got to face that reality. Let's face it forever, and so on. And then I 
got up and said, folks, you are slands. So thank you very much.

01:56:43.645 --> 01:56:44.566
Thank you very much, Van.

01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:50.392
There's a strange breed of creature in the room.

01:56:53.896 --> 01:56:56.159
Easily recognized by its hair foliage.

01:56:58.701 --> 01:57:03.246
There's a strange breed of creature that likes to run conventions. You know who you are. And one of them we've chosen as our fan guest of honor. 
Now, we are eternally grateful to Mary for many things. One of the most important is that she made us the easiest choice we ever had for a fan guest

01:57:16.727 --> 01:57:24.484
of honor. About a week after last year's convention, we were holding a post-mortem meeting and she said, by and went to the bar to get a drink and 
while she was gone we voted and told her by the time she got back so we're grateful for making that simple on us however we are not grateful for the

01:57:30.878 --> 01:57:49.967
fact that it means we had to replace her Fortunately, we got someone who did a good job, but I had envisioned spending this conclave, conclave 
four, sitting out there. Yeah, someone chickened out on me.

01:58:09.528 --> 01:58:17.001
So, one thing that I kind of introduced Mary, and I've known Mary for two, three years now, I don't know what to say here. Mary and I think alike on 
running conventions. It's not that you get to stand up in front of people like I do here. It's not that you get your name splashed around the

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:33.471
program book or something like that. The real good thing, at least as far as she and I are concerned, on running a convention, is that it works. 
That when you sit up here at the head table this time of night, as far as the chairman and the vice chairman are concerned, the convention has

01:58:40.878 --> 01:58:50.968
worked. That kind of thing is a good feeling, and we wanted to reward someone publicly for putting out that kind of good feeling. Here's Mary 
Mueller.

01:59:10.492 --> 01:59:12.335
I wore my camouflage tonight. When I was at Acticon two weeks ago, I asked Bill Bowers for some ideas, because I'm really nervous, you guys. I 
really am. It's real nerve-racking to be up here. And you're waiting, and you're waiting. And all of a sudden, Stevie gets up and says wonderful

01:59:24.454 --> 01:59:28.039
things about you. And everybody says wonderful things to you. And it's really a great feeling. But there are feathers all over back here. You 
would not believe. It's been shedding like crazy. But anyway, this afternoon, well, when I get in last night, I said, how would you like to chair a

01:59:39.837 --> 01:59:46.824
panel tomorrow? And I said, oh, what's the topic? Oh, you pick it. So the Bill and Barry show actually happened today, but it was the Bill, Barry, 
and Mary show. And I got some ideas for my speech. See, we had, I decided I didn't want to do a burning issues speech, but rather do a gosh wow,

02:00:01.219 --> 02:00:08.747
because I really love everybody. I mean I may not know all your faces but I sure as hell know all your names.

02:00:17.435 --> 02:00:26.347
So anyway, one of the topics for speech was Larry Niven's indebtedness to the schmooze for the bandersnatch.

02:00:28.630 --> 02:00:31.614
Somebody had spaceships on their socks. Why am I in fandom because of you wonderful, crazy people? I have a schmoo picture here. If I'm dying at 
the microphone, pour water. And in conclusion, I'd like to say I love you all. And thanks for having me and thanks for being so wonderful. And I

02:00:52.756 --> 02:00:57.869
hope to see your face and your name across the registration desk sometime in the future. So take care and I love you.

02:00:57.869 --> 02:01:15.923
[Applause.]

02:01:15.923 --> 02:01:20.750
One of the other neat things about running conventions is that you get to give away things. And Tulio, you're here? Yes. Tulio Prone has the first 
of the things that are being given away. This is not from the convention. This is from Tulio, to Van.

02:01:39.776 --> 02:01:45.424
We had a few seconds to speak earlier in the day, but this is for you. This is one of our ray guns. Some of you have obviously seen us in the Huxter 
Room. And those of you who haven't, American.

02:01:58.521 --> 02:01:59.583
It's perfectly safe. As you know, as you know, all weapon shops guns can only be used in self-defense. Now, we've been... We've been working on 
ray guns. I've been doing it for about three years and some of my partners have been with me for almost two now. And it's a nice development that

02:02:19.130 --> 02:02:23.896
we've been able to do as well as we have. And I must admit that the man sitting next to me has been the inspiration. It's been a long time between when 
I first had the idea of trying to make ray guns and selling them to fandom and the time I've actually been able to do it. But at the very beginning, it

02:02:40.028 --> 02:02:45.916
was the Weapons Shops of Issuer that set me off. So we call ourselves now the Weapons Shops of Issuer Enterprise, if you want to be formal about it. 
And we decided this would be a good occasion to show our appreciation to our, well, namesake, if not actual founder. We had the bad taste of not

02:03:00.436 --> 02:03:06.564
doing it until now, but trying to make up for it. We did a little special effort on this one. This one has sound as well as light on it. And for those of 
you who have been complaining, how come they don't make any noise? And after the speech or whatever, I'll give you a little explanation how to do

02:03:20.736 --> 02:03:28.834
all the secret things to it.

02:03:37.015 --> 02:03:42.064
I do want to say thank you very much, and I certainly appreciate that they are using the name. I mean, I'm serious about that, because I would never 
have done it. And they have my permission. You can all hear that word here at that statement here now. I think this is a beautiful job here. My 90%

02:03:52.827 --> 02:04:03.665
share of the...

02:03:52.827 --> 02:04:03.665
It does not have to be paid in this lifetime. Thank you. So, well, it's a... Just look at that. Isn't that a beautiful instrument? I don't think 
that they could have been better in 7,000 years from now when the weapon shops were in full flower. And I'm delighted to have someone had this

02:04:19.574 --> 02:04:36.975
time-trip system bring one of them back here and I shall carry it, you know.

02:04:43.807 --> 02:04:45.990
Nobody wants to hear stories about delays. So we're not going to tell you one. We'll just simply tell you that there was a delay and the gift that we 
had planned to give Van from the convention didn't quite get finished in time. So it's not done yet. Therefore, we are giving a sort of an IOU.

02:05:05.818 --> 02:05:13.088
These are copies, number one and two, of the Enchanted Village Van short story, beautifully illustrated by Joan Wood.

02:05:17.168 --> 02:05:18.811
It's a special limited edition. At this point it's available only here and at LostCon. Copies number one and two, we are giving to Van. We are 
going to take copy number one and have it hardbound and it'll be shipped to you later.

02:05:41.947 --> 02:05:45.252
Now, now to give something to the other guest of honor. When we sat down to think about what to give, we were kind of dumbfounded. The first 
suggestion, the one that everyone went along with, was brass knuckles. Wait a minute, you've been promising me those brass knuckles for two

02:05:57.666 --> 02:06:00.689
years. And we still haven't got them. The people who didn't come through know who they are. But we can't threaten them because they still have the 
brass knuckles.

02:06:14.121 --> 02:06:16.723
So Susie is going to present the alternative.

02:06:28.651 --> 02:06:34.198
Not fair because Steve promised me she'd have something delicate in her hand so that she couldn't hit me. All right.

02:06:40.605 --> 02:06:48.695
They really didn't want to leave me with very much time at this microphone because they were afraid that I'd take over and make all sorts of 
atrocious puns. But I took one look at Steve and the fear of God come upon me.

02:06:58.283 --> 02:06:59.685
So I decided to be good.

02:07:08.136 --> 02:07:08.476
All right. They decided that there was only one person who could really present this gift to Mary with all the respect and admiration that she 
really deserves.

02:07:20.552 --> 02:07:23.436
It's a magazine by Heavy Metals. It's called Candice at Sea.

02:07:31.190 --> 02:07:36.060
I just hope that my remarks haven't been too offshore. And I won't sweep her away to sea with

02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:51.291
this.

02:07:55.962 --> 02:07:56.643
All right. Traditionally, these gifts have sort of come in threes, one to our pro guest of honor, one to our fan guest of honor, and one to somebody 
we love, a special person. This year, the special gift goes to Tom Barber. Stand up, Tom.

02:08:25.662 --> 02:08:28.469
Tom, along with Larry, was one of the founding members of Waldo. He was the chairman of Conclaves 1 and 2. He's been my friend for a long time. He's 
one of the very first people I met when I moved here.

02:08:43.162 --> 02:08:46.227
Do you realize how confused anyone listening to this tape is going to be? He's been a good friend of mine for a long time. And when we were fishing 
around, we said, gee, we need another gift. And the first person I thought of was Tom. So from all of us, Tom.

02:08:46.227 --> 02:09:14.971
[Applause and laughter.]

02:09:14.971 --> 02:09:20.536
For this giant paper one, I wish to...

02:09:14.971 --> 02:09:20.536
Oh! Dragon mug. Very, very nice.

02:09:28.103 --> 02:09:29.545
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

02:09:29.545 --> 02:09:37.292
[Applause.]

02:09:37.292 --> 02:09:39.394
Okay, last, ta-da! Last, and maybe least, I don't know, Pardon? I've already plugged it. I'm not going to plug it again. Hopefully not least, 
George tells me that I am to leave space in this presentation for a surprise. George?

02:09:39.394 --> 02:10:00.000
[Movement.]

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:00.501
Can I sit down? Yes, you can.

02:10:14.118 --> 02:10:15.440
I'm reduced in size.

02:10:18.283 --> 02:10:25.553
Everybody, I'm sure, is very much appreciates what Steve has done for this convention and everything else, and they're aware of his many 
talents. But not to people know about a major contribution that he's made to fandom. He probably doesn't remember it. He's not going to want to be

02:10:32.502 --> 02:10:38.910
reminded of the incident, but too bad.

02:10:39.464 --> 02:10:41.727
My very first con ever was Marcon. And I went up to the filk singing room. I didn't know they called it filk singing. And there was this very 
handsome and wonderfully talented young man singing the most incredible songs I've ever heard in my life.

02:10:56.043 --> 02:10:58.106
And I said, I've got to hear this guy again. And that's why I went to my second con. I even got to meet him. When he hit me in the shoulder with a jar of 
mustard,

02:11:08.405 --> 02:11:21.824
It didn't hurt, it didn't stain, didn't bother me at all, but that didn't prevent me from embarrassing him in front of at least 40 people by 
yelling, A. Steve, you owe me for the mustard, and neglecting to explain that it was a perfectly harmless incident. There are at least three

02:11:21.844 --> 02:11:26.750
people wandering around in the world who think it's a really kinky version of Lime Jello fandom.

02:11:32.518 --> 02:11:35.863
Will you explain all of this to my wife? It's harmless. He's a gentleman. He's wonderful. But because I enjoy his filking and because he is a great 
guy and because mustard fandom is now in direct competition with great fandom, we have for him as a gift Dijon type mustard, extra strong. And for

02:11:53.899 --> 02:12:05.412
those of you who are up on your fairy tales, it's decorated with the Bremantown musicians.

02:12:05.797 --> 02:12:09.140
I've heard recently that if a fan does something once, it's a tradition. If they do it twice, it's a sacred tradition. I think I've just made a 
sacred tradition of embarrassing Steve in public.

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:20.852
This does not obligate him to sing God's Own Drunk.

02:12:20.852 --> 02:12:32.324
[Silence.]

02:12:32.324 --> 02:12:35.247
I won't be coming home tonight.

02:12:35.247 --> 02:12:44.575
[Laughter.]

02:12:44.575 --> 02:12:45.416
And neither will she. Okay,

02:12:45.436 --> 02:12:56.213
unless someone has a final announcement, we are going to declare the banquet officially closed. All right, all staff and gophers in here, we're 
going to switch over to the auction. Is Rusty here? I damn well hope so. He's auctioneering. Oh yes, about the wine. All you people who bought

02:13:09.655 --> 02:13:15.105
wine, come and see me or I'll come and see you.
