00:01.160 --> 00:02.980
Okay, the tapes are on again.

00:05.020 --> 00:11.460
As an English professor and a creative writing teacher, how does most science fiction stack

00:11.460 --> 00:13.380
up from that perspective?

00:14.820 --> 00:23.240
Well, that's the greatest problem a science fiction reader has is finding the good and

00:23.240 --> 00:30.720
avoiding the bad because it's such a popular genre that there's a lot of really kind of

00:30.720 --> 00:32.300
ordinary stuff being published.

00:34.260 --> 00:40.900
And I'm teaching a course in science fiction now and I have found that the books we're

00:40.900 --> 00:41.980
using are really good.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.760
I think they're excellent books.

00:44.340 --> 00:51.600
They're very difficult to teach in the manner in which one teaches a fine novel because

00:51.600 --> 00:52.800
they're written as entertainment.

00:53.140 --> 01:00.760
The texture is not so tightly woven, but the ideas are there.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.620
In essence, what you do is discuss the ideas.

01:04.640 --> 01:10.660
So really, it's one of the great skills for the science fiction reader is learning how

01:10.660 --> 01:19.420
to find good stuff, using reviews, using as much as possible histories of science fiction,

01:20.180 --> 01:23.620
reading the big names, and working out from there.

01:24.600 --> 01:32.340
I know some science fiction scholars like Sam Moskowitz are kind of encyclopedias of

01:32.340 --> 01:36.660
just enormous quantities of material that they have read.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.620
And that's one approach to it.

01:39.740 --> 01:46.740
That's not my own because I don't see the necessity of knowing and mastering mediocre

01:46.740 --> 01:47.240
writing.

01:48.160 --> 01:53.220
And really, in mainstream fiction, we do the same thing.

01:53.460 --> 01:56.140
We try to avoid the bad.

01:57.280 --> 02:04.120
And I think it's kind of strange that people who scorn science fiction often scorn it for

02:04.120 --> 02:10.000
the bad stuff, but they don't read bad stuff in mainstream fiction as they can help it.

02:10.440 --> 02:11.540
They just read the best.

02:13.400 --> 02:19.340
It's getting so, there is enough science fiction, so there is a lot that you can say,

02:19.420 --> 02:21.060
yes, this is good, this is the best.

02:21.800 --> 02:29.640
And you don't have to read really inferior material until you become so enthusiastic

02:29.640 --> 02:33.900
or so legend or tired or whatever that you don't care.

02:36.220 --> 02:43.040
I think it was Barry Malzberg that said that science fiction is, I think he included racial

02:43.040 --> 02:48.920
minorities and modern dance is the three things that are judged by their worst examples.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.800
Yes, yes, I agree.

02:54.690 --> 02:58.360
Is there anybody, who are the people that you tend to like?

02:58.360 --> 03:03.620
Do you tend to read hard science fiction, fantasy, everything pretty Catholic in your

03:03.620 --> 03:03.920
taste?

03:04.680 --> 03:08.440
Yeah, I tend to read fairly broadly.

03:09.200 --> 03:15.200
I am extremely fond of Ursula Le Guin in almost all her phases.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.960
I think Arthur C. Clark is excellent.

03:20.020 --> 03:25.840
I like some of John Wyndham, particularly The Day of the Trifids.

03:26.840 --> 03:31.460
And of course the older people like H.G. Wells are fine.

03:31.980 --> 03:34.020
Isaac Asimov is almost always good.

03:34.860 --> 03:42.480
I think his foundation trilogy is a book that does something to the mind of the sensitive

03:42.480 --> 03:45.060
reader from which he will never recover.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.440
That is, it enlarges thought.

03:48.780 --> 03:57.220
And just as Clark's work gives one a sense of the ongoing human quest, the meeting of

03:57.220 --> 03:59.480
challenges, and moving beyond them.

03:59.580 --> 04:01.800
That is really very fine.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.220
These are the ones I like the best.

04:05.160 --> 04:11.100
Of course there are lots of individual books like Miller's, Canticle for Libowins, that

04:11.100 --> 04:11.400
are good.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.440
I myself am not too fond of Heinlein.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.000
I know that is probably a heretical statement.

04:20.960 --> 04:26.540
But I read a statement he made about how to write that I think put me off a little bit.

04:26.660 --> 04:31.020
He said, write as fast as you can, keep writing and never revise.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.760
And I thought, wait a minute, we deserve better than that.

04:38.380 --> 04:40.560
I don't particularly care for Heinlein either.

04:40.560 --> 04:45.100
I didn't read him as a kid and I started trying to read him as an adult and I think that was

04:45.100 --> 04:45.500
a mistake.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.820
I think if you read him as a kid he's probably not so bad.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.360
Yeah, I think you're right.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.400
You're on a faculty and a small university.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.840
How do your peers take your writing?

05:01.560 --> 05:07.460
Okay, it's one thing to write something esoteric and get it into a journal, but you're commercial.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.320
How does that set with people?

05:10.060 --> 05:17.580
Well, it's really, it has been a lot of fun for me because, you know, really if you write

05:17.580 --> 05:23.920
an article for PMLA it takes you fully as long as writing a whole novel.

05:25.420 --> 05:31.280
And you do this and you get it published and you never hear anything about it again.

05:31.800 --> 05:38.600
So though you took it and put it in a bonfire somewhere, maybe it'll appear in a bibliography

05:38.600 --> 05:46.280
somewhere or someone might mention it in a footnote, but it's just, oh, it's some sort

05:46.280 --> 05:47.720
of ritual that one does.

05:48.520 --> 05:52.680
Someone, you know, that you like pain or something.

05:53.260 --> 06:00.220
But I keep meeting people on the campus whose eyes are red because they got reading my

06:00.220 --> 06:02.640
novel and stayed up almost all night reading it.

06:04.300 --> 06:10.800
And they're all very responsive and very amused and they think it's great.

06:12.460 --> 06:18.960
They don't think I've sold out because they're too interested in, I guess I'm the first

06:18.960 --> 06:21.360
novelist that Principia College has ever had.

06:23.020 --> 06:26.580
It's a new thing for them and they're enjoying it as much as I am, I think.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.240
How do you handle the writing?

06:31.580 --> 06:37.260
You do it after hours, every night, every weekend, take up all your spare time or what?

06:37.840 --> 06:44.540
No, I am involved in too many other things to do it in all my spare time, but when I'm

06:44.540 --> 06:48.680
involved in a novel I do think about it a great deal.

06:49.720 --> 06:56.540
And I try to work every day if I can, but sometimes particularly in the month of May,

06:58.500 --> 07:00.840
I'll have about four or five days go by.

07:01.640 --> 07:06.220
I can't get to it and I tend to write in bursts on weekends.

07:07.400 --> 07:13.460
Really, summers are the most productive time, so because then I can set aside some time

07:13.460 --> 07:19.880
every day and work on it and then when I'm not working on it, I'm thinking about it,

07:21.500 --> 07:26.480
it changes the nature of a novel to have to write it slowly because you're doing other

07:26.480 --> 07:31.720
things because things occur to you.

07:32.280 --> 07:39.460
Before you get a scene written, you see it's not going to work or a new angle occurs to

07:39.460 --> 07:44.080
you or an additional aspect of the scene comes.

07:44.360 --> 07:50.980
So I think in a sense it enriches the novel, but it also demands more rewriting because

07:52.200 --> 07:54.480
you do lose the sense of continuity.

07:58.640 --> 08:03.940
Do you do the convent, go to the conventions and meet the fans and the other writers and

08:03.940 --> 08:05.080
get inspiration that way?

08:05.080 --> 08:12.360
I have only been to two conventions of the Science Fiction Research Association, which

08:12.360 --> 08:18.880
is an affiliate of the Modern Language Association, and it's not a typical con.

08:19.580 --> 08:26.520
I'm going to go to the Archon in St. Louis this summer and I've met some of the St. Louis

08:26.520 --> 08:28.320
fans, they're really nice people.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.960
I'm not in that scene yet, I don't know much about it.

08:34.960 --> 08:41.540
I think from what I've heard a lot of it's kind of bizarre with people dressing up as

08:41.540 --> 08:42.580
monsters and stuff.

08:45.420 --> 08:52.120
Yeah, you get your stereotypical type fans there, that's for sure.

08:52.500 --> 08:58.200
One person you might be interested in talking to in St. Louis is Glenn Cook because I thought

08:58.200 --> 09:03.900
of him when I was reading your battle scenes because he's got the trilogy where all the

09:03.900 --> 09:06.740
battle scenes are laid out and the strategies and that sort of thing.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.640
I think you...

09:09.640 --> 09:11.980
I've met him, some people tell me I ought to get to know him.

09:12.220 --> 09:13.980
Yeah, he's exactly who I thought about.

09:14.120 --> 09:19.140
Now the similarities between the stories aren't that close, but you have that characteristic

09:19.140 --> 09:19.780
in common.

09:20.100 --> 09:24.200
I believe he has studied battles and that sort of thing though, that's kind of what inspired

09:24.200 --> 09:24.880
my question.

09:25.300 --> 09:25.660
I see.

09:27.000 --> 09:35.420
Any plans for books outside the Three Rivers area, something more towards heart science

09:35.420 --> 09:39.240
fiction or other historical type science fiction, or have you thought that far ahead?

09:39.740 --> 09:41.780
I really haven't thought that far ahead.

09:41.980 --> 09:45.140
I'm sort of three books ahead of myself now.

09:45.720 --> 09:51.460
For a long time I've wanted to write a historical novel about 19th century Illinois.

09:51.460 --> 09:58.040
In fact, for far longer than I've been writing science fiction and I may take time out to

09:58.040 --> 10:01.720
do that if I can find the time.

10:02.180 --> 10:08.720
I don't want to interrupt the kind of on rushing perceptions I'm having though with the science

10:08.720 --> 10:13.500
fiction theory, so I'll just let that ride for now.

10:16.160 --> 10:23.080
I think that in a sense when I planned that novel years ago, the idea of writing a novel

10:23.080 --> 10:25.600
just sort of kept me in awe.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.460
I wasn't sure I could do it.

10:29.080 --> 10:29.700
Now I am.

10:31.420 --> 10:37.040
Because the breaking of North Wall really surprised me into doing it and I discovered that I could.

10:39.040 --> 10:46.000
I'm really glad that I was able to take what you might call a lighthearted approach towards the

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
writing of the novel and see that it is actually possible to do that.

10:57.480 --> 11:01.760
To kind of wrap things up, how does one go about selling a first novel?

11:05.620 --> 11:08.060
Well, I don't know that I know.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.400
What you do, of course, is kind of study the market.

11:13.000 --> 11:21.420
Find out the ones that you would really like to sell to and make what I call a hierarchical list

11:21.420 --> 11:22.660
starting with the best.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.920
In my case, I started with Del Ray.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.880
I thought that was the best and they took it.

11:29.540 --> 11:35.520
That's why I say I don't know because it's usually a much more complicated process.

11:37.840 --> 11:46.200
Many publishers want you to send two chapters and an outline of the rest or to send a query letter first.

11:47.140 --> 11:53.960
But luckily, I ran into Judy Del Ray in New York at a Modern Language Association meeting.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.100
I asked her, I told her, I have this manuscript.

11:58.740 --> 12:00.620
Would you read it if I sent it to you?

12:00.800 --> 12:05.720
She was interested but very mildly so.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.940
She said, yes, I'll read it.

12:08.020 --> 12:13.180
I don't guarantee to do it very rapidly, but yes, we always do read on solicited manuscripts.

12:14.620 --> 12:17.340
I finally sent it the next June.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.180
This was December.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.200
I sent it in June.

12:19.540 --> 12:22.600
I did not hear from them until the following March.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.700
One of the techniques is patience.

12:27.240 --> 12:31.160
I said to myself, as long as it's out there, it's not coming back.

12:33.140 --> 12:36.160
To longer it's out there, maybe the better it is.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.960
I had a very easy time.

12:41.020 --> 12:41.920
I was very fortunate.

12:43.120 --> 12:48.160
Did you start writing the second one while the first one was still up there gestating?

12:48.160 --> 12:49.020
No.

12:49.940 --> 12:57.220
I started writing it the day after Owen Locke, who is the editor there, called me and said

12:57.220 --> 13:01.520
they were going to take the breaking of North Wall and he said, do you have anything else?

13:02.200 --> 13:05.320
And I said, no, I was waiting to see how this one would go.

13:07.220 --> 13:14.440
But I was so thrilled by the acceptance that this idea that had been kind of germinating

13:14.440 --> 13:19.320
in my mind immediately came into focus and I began outlining.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.500
Okay, that's the list of questions.
