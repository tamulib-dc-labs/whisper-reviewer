00:02.260 --> 00:04.000
You don't know it's a science fiction here.

00:04.100 --> 00:04.920
You're well trapped.

00:07.240 --> 00:10.660
Because it's not packaged as science fiction, which didn't matter to me.

00:12.280 --> 00:12.920
Deliver it.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.960
You can tape it if you want.

00:19.240 --> 00:24.220
Revolent time was a definite attempt between myself and the publisher.

00:24.360 --> 00:24.920
I had the idea.

00:25.400 --> 00:31.060
I saw the idea as being something that a non-science fiction reader would buy.

00:31.960 --> 00:36.160
Science fiction sells 20% of all fiction in the United States in paperback, which is not

00:36.160 --> 00:36.560
bad.

00:37.060 --> 00:40.180
But being a writer, I see 80% more I could sell.

00:40.720 --> 00:41.940
And publishers like to sell more too.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.400
So we talked about the novel.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.060
I said it's pure science fiction, but it starts out as a mystery novel.

00:47.500 --> 00:51.600
And it's a good core of the way into it before the science fiction element is brought in.

00:52.080 --> 00:54.900
It's a science fiction element that the reader will accept any general reader.

00:55.620 --> 00:56.400
And by that time he's trapped.

00:57.240 --> 01:02.740
And I think if you think you can sell as a mainstream, I will try it.

01:03.220 --> 01:05.960
And I turned the manuscript in England and America and I said, yes, we're going to try

01:05.960 --> 01:07.440
and sell this to everybody.

01:10.380 --> 01:15.260
And 10, 20 years ago, I couldn't have done that because I had no big name and the readers

01:15.260 --> 01:16.000
would not have bought it.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.020
Now I have enough readers around.

01:19.440 --> 01:19.920
They'll see it.

01:19.920 --> 01:20.480
They'll see my name on it.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.820
They'll look at it, open it, maybe buy it.

01:21.840 --> 01:22.540
The science fiction reader is.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.600
So I don't think we'll lose one science fiction reader by packaging it that way.

01:25.900 --> 01:30.200
We might pick up a lot of other readers, which make me happy, my publisher happy, my wife

01:30.200 --> 01:33.720
happy, my children, my bank manager, you know, all the things you want to make happy.

01:36.660 --> 01:37.020
Okay.

01:38.780 --> 01:45.000
We've talked a bit about your novels, but we haven't made short stories in Britain.

01:45.380 --> 01:46.100
One or two of those.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.920
How do you attack a short story as opposed to the novels that they occur to you?

01:52.380 --> 01:58.340
In science fiction, unlike a lot of other fiction, there are people who write both short stories

01:58.340 --> 01:58.960
and novels.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.500
Most, some of them can, a lot of them can.

02:02.180 --> 02:04.680
And very simply, it is least residual.

02:05.460 --> 02:10.980
A short story is a one idea story with a single gimmick or device or turn of plot.

02:10.980 --> 02:14.700
And you write that to length and stop it at two or three or four or five thousand words.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.240
If it's complicated, it goes to 10,000 novelette.

02:18.880 --> 02:23.920
As opposed to a novel, which is a complex thought that requires modifications, more

02:23.920 --> 02:27.720
than one idea, ramifications, and then it goes to novel length.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.960
And many times I first started writing, I had short story ideas, and they're very good

02:33.960 --> 02:34.320
to do.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.700
They go in the magazines, they go in anthologies, read, recognize your name.

02:37.700 --> 02:41.520
And deliberately between novels would do a half dozen short stories.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.940
Unhappily, after a number of years of writing, you find publishers want to give you more

02:45.940 --> 02:47.200
money for novels.

02:47.840 --> 02:48.800
And they really do.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.440
The word rate per word in a novel is about ten times the short story.

02:53.320 --> 02:57.220
And I find myself telling to cook one novel at the end of the other.

02:57.660 --> 03:00.420
I've written a short story in three or four or five years, which I think is a shame because

03:00.420 --> 03:03.940
I have four collections of short stories out all selling quite nicely.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.540
And they've been apologizing about 22 languages.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.180
But in the history of time, I found a time in life I wanted to anthologize and I did.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.100
A time in life I wanted to write short stories I did.

03:13.460 --> 03:17.620
Now I'm trying to write longer and longer books like Rebels in Time, the current book,

03:17.660 --> 03:21.000
which will be about a quarter of a million words, at least perhaps longer.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.160
Not because I want to write a long book, because a very complex idea requires that amount of

03:25.160 --> 03:26.040
time to work out.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.140
And there again, it's writers' lives go in the waves like the ocean.

03:31.300 --> 03:35.440
You search up the beach, a lot of dead things in it, and go away out to the ocean again

03:35.440 --> 03:36.200
in clear depths.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.980
You produce different things at different times.

03:38.840 --> 03:44.880
If you could write anything you want, not worrying about economic exigences, would

03:44.880 --> 03:49.300
you stick to short stories or would they mean that much to you?

03:49.800 --> 03:54.840
I'm happy to say that for the last 20-odd years, I've never written a thing I didn't

03:54.840 --> 03:55.420
want to write.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.380
I've turned down assignments I didn't enjoy and I've written just exactly the book in

03:59.380 --> 04:00.600
short stories I wanted to write.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.180
It's a nice position to be in, Tim.

04:04.980 --> 04:09.360
I read the books that you've signed so far, the collections.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.080
I think I have all the collections.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.940
So I read all those short stories plus summits and apologies.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.940
And rescue operation far and away was my favorite.

04:19.820 --> 04:20.640
That's unusual here.

04:21.340 --> 04:22.480
Yes, the rescue operation.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.020
There again, I see one idea.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.560
That rescue operation came out.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.100
Everything in there, I know, except the alien.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.920
In Yugoslavia, the most broken down country in Western Europe, they have peasants there

04:35.920 --> 04:39.100
which are much more broken down than German peasants.

04:39.740 --> 04:46.240
They have deeply religious, civil-mindedly stupid people burning peasants within 10 miles

04:46.240 --> 04:47.200
of a nuclear reactor.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.680
The perfect analog of our world.

04:50.140 --> 04:55.200
Instead of northern civilized countries, southern poor, uncivilized countries, all in one country.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.860
And having been in the middle of this and having had a number of desperately awful things

05:00.860 --> 05:04.840
happen to me and my family down there, the children got scarlet fever, had injections

05:05.360 --> 05:08.340
with blunt needles, had a carium screaming, you know, sort of thing.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.500
And I got living in that desperate, awful world.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.380
And there again, the background was there.

05:14.840 --> 05:18.920
And then the thought, instead of arriving in Central Park in front of the White House,

05:19.220 --> 05:21.580
what if the alien from space arrived there?

05:22.580 --> 05:24.000
Voila, you know, complete.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.540
Just a matter of writing it.

05:26.580 --> 05:31.260
I was also very moved by the one...

05:32.380 --> 05:33.980
I'm terrible at names and titles.

05:34.200 --> 05:39.760
The one where you said you got the idea when you were in Europe, or wherever you are,

05:39.840 --> 05:42.880
you heard that Martin Luther King had been shot, so basically he was just turned over.

05:43.160 --> 05:43.580
That's right.

05:45.420 --> 05:46.900
Not me, not Amos Cabot.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.340
No, that's not what they would say.

05:48.400 --> 05:48.760
I'll come again.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.120
That's not a short story.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.280
Yeah, Mute Milton, Mute Milton.

05:54.420 --> 05:54.860
Mute Milton.

05:54.980 --> 06:00.800
Yeah, living in Scandinavia, but now this dates two or three or four years, and the

06:00.800 --> 06:02.240
Danes are absolutely colorblind.

06:03.900 --> 06:08.400
That in fact, in those days, really certain kind of girls only date black men.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.880
They all they go, they just look down upon them.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.640
There were about four black men in the whole country, you know.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.080
And you know, you just have to say, it's very easy to be pro-race, anti-race away

06:15.080 --> 06:16.520
if you're in a country with no race problems.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.180
But I mean, living there, the children growing up there, and Martin Luther King

06:21.180 --> 06:24.940
was shot and a newspaper called me, asked me what my opinion on it, you know,

06:25.060 --> 06:26.320
and they were all horrified.

06:26.940 --> 06:30.980
And then I pick a copy of Newsweek up and they had some great big belly

06:31.340 --> 06:34.980
Alabama, a photograph of him with a shotgun one hand, a nose picker in the other.

06:35.100 --> 06:40.340
And his belly hangover is his belt, you know, saying, well, just one more

06:40.340 --> 06:40.900
nigga to me.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.640
And I just, my white heat enculfed my mind.

06:44.420 --> 06:47.080
One of America's, he got a Nobel Prize earlier than that.

06:47.380 --> 06:50.300
You know, one of America's, well, I was very proud he came over there.

06:50.300 --> 06:54.000
Then Scandinavia, hit an American getting a prize for doing something really

06:54.000 --> 06:55.560
good in the world, being honored for it.

06:56.040 --> 07:00.920
And I saw red and the idea came to me, you know, the story just began

07:00.920 --> 07:05.920
to put into a story that, that rage I had, that strong feeling.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.320
And if I write, I can do that.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.000
Well, then you're successful story.

07:11.440 --> 07:16.020
The thing that came to mind, you were, you described the device that he had

07:16.940 --> 07:19.680
had concocted and there's a lot of detail in that.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.340
Reminds me of other in your own knowledge.

07:21.420 --> 07:24.660
You have a lot of engineering and physics and mechanics and that sort of thing.

07:25.500 --> 07:31.400
That's not in your background per se, but you must have an interest in it to put it.

07:31.540 --> 07:31.580
Yeah.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.920
Well, my background superficially looks like it's all in the arts.

07:35.320 --> 07:41.000
But in reality, my early training was as a mechanic and a computer engineer

07:41.820 --> 07:45.300
began all in the military for some reason, best known to myself.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.600
I have a very high mechanical aptitude.

07:48.600 --> 07:53.100
The army had a test for this and the maximum 160, I did 156.

07:53.640 --> 07:58.040
So they ramble, they threw me into a school, the northern bombsite, the old

07:58.040 --> 07:59.680
northern bombsite, the mystery of the war.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.900
And it works on that and the computing gun sites right next to it.

08:04.180 --> 08:05.480
And I could do it and I enjoyed it.

08:05.660 --> 08:09.600
And I spent the whole war working on these things and driving a truck

08:09.600 --> 08:11.120
and teach people to shoot, you know.

08:11.820 --> 08:14.920
And so my background is there is in mechanics.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.000
I know this is a mechanics.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.500
And I did major in biology in school before I went in.

08:19.380 --> 08:21.840
And I keep my reading up.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.180
That's all.

08:22.320 --> 08:27.000
I mean, a science fiction writer shouldn't be a jackdaw of science.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.400
You should know enough about any science to read an article on it and know what

08:31.400 --> 08:33.000
they're talking about, what I do.

08:33.700 --> 08:37.220
The nice part is among science fiction readers, there's so many closet

08:37.220 --> 08:38.540
readers who have other jobs.

08:38.980 --> 08:42.760
Every engineer in the world, in every school, you see to be a science fiction

08:42.760 --> 08:47.120
fan, professors of this biology linguistics, and they love this stuff.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.080
And I have a problem.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.180
I just grabbed some professor, a doctor teaching physics, said, tell me about

08:52.180 --> 08:55.560
that, they'll sit down because you know yourself, any engineer, all he wants to

08:55.560 --> 08:58.200
was talk about a speciality over and over and over again.

08:58.420 --> 08:59.360
I love to hear about it.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.260
And I pinned these guys down.

09:02.340 --> 09:06.120
I know enough about the basics of mechanics and biology.

09:06.660 --> 09:07.320
And that's your favorite.

09:07.460 --> 09:08.400
Understand they're talking about.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.160
And for a while, I'm an authority on it.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.340
I did Skyfall.

09:12.660 --> 09:17.500
I had a science fiction fan in England who's an upper atmosphere specialist

09:17.500 --> 09:19.220
in about three in the world at the time.

09:19.820 --> 09:24.020
A typical British program, sending British packages up in American rockets

09:24.020 --> 09:25.880
from Norway, you know, into the upper atmosphere.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.860
And for one while there, I had charts.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.780
I understood all about orbital mechanics.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.460
I know everything about it for one glorious month or two.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.120
I did that chapter.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.060
It's all gone now.

09:37.080 --> 09:41.640
And again, to answer the question, I know the areas I don't know.

09:41.840 --> 09:46.100
I know enough to ask somebody and not get it right and have them check it out.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.520
But you really should do your sums and science fiction, get your facts right

09:49.520 --> 09:52.860
and then work around that known facts should be right and make up your own

09:52.860 --> 09:53.500
facts afterwards.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.560
Skyfall was almost prophetic, wasn't it?

09:57.460 --> 09:58.240
Not almost.

09:58.520 --> 09:59.540
Skyfall was prophetic.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.440
Yeah, now twice.

10:05.160 --> 10:10.100
The skyfall was prophetic in the sense that there again, from the literature

10:10.100 --> 10:14.200
I discovered that the Russians and the Americans were lying to the world.

10:15.180 --> 10:18.420
These great big boosters did not burn upon reentry.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.640
They just flashed down the ocean.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.380
And what they were doing was relying upon the law of averages.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.400
Three quarters of the world was water, right?

10:27.480 --> 10:30.140
Ninety eight percent of the land is desert or mountain, right?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.280
So the chances are you're never going to drop on somebody.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.680
Oh, yeah, I said.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.420
So this friend, the rocket program showed me.

10:38.020 --> 10:43.520
Radio Sun Rocket, they sent up with, you know, an instrumentation in the nose.

10:43.620 --> 10:46.240
Was it too important things up our atmosphere and had failed.

10:46.540 --> 10:51.260
Went 150 miles, turned over under full blast and blasted down at full speed

10:51.260 --> 10:51.940
into the ground.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.940
That's it all is still working, you know.

10:55.260 --> 10:57.240
So no, they don't burn up the atmosphere.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.880
And I said, one of these days, they're going to drop one of these things

11:00.880 --> 11:02.280
in the wrong place and they're big.

11:02.280 --> 11:05.060
They weigh tons and tons and tons and we're being lied to.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.280
So then again, that's a plot.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.400
And I worked on a plot where you drop it on something big.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.540
And, you know, a little bit later.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.180
And the interesting part was doubly prophetic in that.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.320
At this point, we didn't know the upper atmosphere very much.

11:21.220 --> 11:24.400
And Professor Webb was telling me that he said, gee, you know,

11:24.460 --> 11:29.380
just discovered the upper atmosphere is so tenuous that when a photon storm,

11:29.380 --> 11:33.680
the solar flare large when hits the upper atmosphere, it can move up a

11:33.680 --> 11:36.160
matter of 50, 80 miles, a matter of minutes.

11:36.460 --> 11:39.460
Because as a heat interstate molecule, they expand up, it goes.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.420
And wow, I said plot device.

11:42.680 --> 11:46.960
I needed a way of stopping my orbiting ship to get it down in one spot.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.900
Solar storm, it goes around the back of the earth, comes out like hitting a

11:49.900 --> 11:52.740
wall and falls. Guess why Skylab came down.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.580
They put Skylab in orbit.

11:54.740 --> 11:55.840
They did not know this happened.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.520
It came down for just that reason.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.100
And I put this guy's mind.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.460
That's fun to do. Let me tell you.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.860
I'll ask you two more questions in one of them.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.500
It just occurred to me.

12:06.680 --> 12:08.760
What what what's it like?

12:09.760 --> 12:13.600
Raise a family, marry a family, be a science fiction writer.

12:13.980 --> 12:16.860
What what does your wife and family have to put up with?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.320
Well, you really should ask my wife.

12:18.540 --> 12:19.440
We should ask my wife.

12:21.620 --> 12:22.740
It's never boring.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.060
All right.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.000
Um, it.

12:30.280 --> 12:34.300
Writers are a pretty dim lot to begin with.

12:34.980 --> 12:36.400
They and I know a lot of them.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.500
They're people ears that can tanker us.

12:39.800 --> 12:44.000
What they do, they really want to write into nothing else.

12:44.660 --> 12:46.020
And women don't really like them.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.340
They they change a lot of ways.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.100
Not because the women can't put up with nonsense.

12:49.740 --> 12:53.240
And the ones that stay married because they marry a woman who is nice enough or

12:53.240 --> 12:54.300
smart enough or.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.880
Komodi is enough to entertain their style of life

12:57.880 --> 13:00.880
and to permit them to do this sort of thing and put up with all their nonsense.

13:01.420 --> 13:04.540
Happy to say my dear wife and I'm moving to Mexico with a one year old baby

13:05.140 --> 13:08.240
and living in a small town with fleas and giving the kid malarish in mind,

13:08.280 --> 13:11.040
going to Denmark or England or Italy.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.780
And it's just the way it works.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.180
The right is not going to change.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.520
It's really up to the wife to put up with the nonsense.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.940
And the kids can kids grow up in any conditions.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.300
Kids think whatever they have is normal.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.000
So they're not a problem at all.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.360
As long as you think about them.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.500
I think it took a lot of good things.

13:29.860 --> 13:31.980
Like automatically learn to write a plan.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.840
They put up with more than just speaking.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.100
More than just speaking.

13:37.840 --> 13:41.000
And they had to get back to the states because they knew they were American.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.620
They lived it and know what it meant.

13:43.220 --> 13:46.720
So we talked out and one decided to remain European.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.200
The other decided to remain American and about that.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.300
I guess I should ask why the moving around.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.020
If that's a fair question.

13:54.200 --> 13:58.440
I don't know what is the nickels and cyclopoeia says your parapetetic.

13:58.780 --> 13:59.940
Yes, that's the word.

14:00.180 --> 14:00.680
I want to edit that.

14:01.120 --> 14:01.940
Yeah, you look it up.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.560
Yeah. Yeah.

14:04.020 --> 14:04.400
One editor.

14:05.340 --> 14:07.840
We should know that's the way you increase your vocabulary.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.920
You know, that's why I love to read Graham Green and Anthony Burgess.

14:12.020 --> 14:13.360
You look up words and Kingsie Amos.

14:13.580 --> 14:17.060
Kingsie Amos one book that says this is back in the 50s.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.440
And it must have been a student back here.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.920
He said, out in the street in New York, I saw a rather amphibianic car.

14:24.120 --> 14:24.780
Amphibianic car.

14:24.900 --> 14:25.660
The hell is that?

14:26.120 --> 14:29.360
It means a creature with a face in both ends.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.340
There are certain worms look like a face in both ends.

14:31.740 --> 14:32.880
Amphiz physiognomy.

14:33.240 --> 14:33.560
By any.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.540
Oh, so great.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.000
Now, that's how you increase your vocabulary.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.300
But yeah, parapet, parapeteticism.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.420
Some are born parapetetic.

14:42.660 --> 14:44.380
Some are tame parapeteticism.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.980
Some have a thrust upon them.

14:47.320 --> 14:47.900
Not bad.

14:48.020 --> 14:48.920
You can't do that every day of the week.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.540
I think I followed all three categories.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.100
I couldn't work in New York.

14:54.300 --> 14:57.220
I've been in Mexico a few times, the station, the boardroom, the war.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.320
I liked it very, very much.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.620
I liked the whole way alive and went to Mexico and we lived there for a year

15:02.620 --> 15:04.140
and then couldn't.

15:04.180 --> 15:06.940
It was just too boring and too simple, nothing much going on with the family.

15:07.540 --> 15:12.040
And then I went to England and once you start moving, you find it's much easier to keep going.

15:13.260 --> 15:20.660
And the answer basically is like when you ask someone, someone asked me why I raise a beard.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.760
I asked them why they shave theirs off.

15:23.940 --> 15:26.580
And I said, why are you living in Texas?

15:27.340 --> 15:31.340
And if you're always in Texas, but why aren't you living in England?

15:31.780 --> 15:34.660
I mean, whenever I've seen a place I didn't want to visit.

15:35.340 --> 15:37.640
And I find it's utterly fascinating to learn about cultures.

15:37.640 --> 15:43.060
I think I told a number of times at different science fiction writers,

15:43.480 --> 15:46.460
if you're writing about other cultures, shouldn't you see a little bit more than your own culture?

15:46.940 --> 15:47.660
Should you get around?

15:49.340 --> 15:52.900
And I find it utterly fascinating to go into a new culture,

15:53.020 --> 15:57.020
I mean, a new kind of life to speak a new language and see how people work.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.620
And I think it must be reflected in my work.

15:59.240 --> 16:04.580
Well, you'd also said, honey, you couldn't write about the future without your present.

16:04.580 --> 16:08.700
I mean, you don't get the past and you don't want to spend.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.780
Because you're talking about the future.

16:12.080 --> 16:12.340
It's different.

16:14.020 --> 16:17.280
Well, you answered my question while I was going to ask you.

16:17.620 --> 16:25.660
Your first Star Wars, the home world was in England and Star Wars was in the States.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.840
Very, very, very definitely, very definitely playing.

16:28.980 --> 16:29.580
You're not like champ.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.440
I mean, obviously when you look at it, you know, but people don't really look at the

16:33.440 --> 16:36.380
unalien. So it's accepted. It's kept the whole good stuff.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.160
Exactly.

16:38.340 --> 16:38.700
Okay.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.700
At the end of the, we want to wind one up.

16:41.220 --> 16:43.060
You want to wind another question, wind it up?

16:43.220 --> 16:43.800
Or are we, how are we doing?

16:44.020 --> 16:44.940
Question to wind it up.

16:45.020 --> 16:45.260
Okay.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.640
A real lightweight question.

16:49.420 --> 16:50.280
How do you want to be remembered?

16:50.740 --> 16:51.780
What are you after?

16:52.260 --> 16:53.200
And how do you want to be remembered?

16:53.580 --> 16:56.480
I'm at this, like John Cowley say staying alive forever.

16:57.580 --> 16:58.440
No, no.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.840
Uh, how do you want to be remembered?

17:01.260 --> 17:01.940
I don't want to be remembered.

17:02.040 --> 17:02.900
I want to be here.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.520
That's a very simple answer.

17:07.020 --> 17:09.440
Running is a very satisfying craft.

17:10.140 --> 17:12.600
When you do it, you're satisfied what you're doing.

17:12.640 --> 17:18.360
If you're doing it well, but then it's not like, I don't really believe that

17:18.360 --> 17:21.100
real writers write in closets for them their own pleasure.

17:21.660 --> 17:23.460
Then your, it's a communication.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.880
It's like talking in sex.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.240
You have it into a relationship going on all the time.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.460
Then after having done the best of your ability, something,

17:30.840 --> 17:33.920
you want to publish it and see if anybody knows what the hell you said.

17:34.780 --> 17:35.780
And that's interesting.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.900
See if you succeeded in what you were trying to do.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.880
See as an artist, I was always doing artwork and getting it out there.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.760
So I'm used to having a feedback public.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.940
And then again, if you would all feel about the state of the world,

17:47.460 --> 17:49.480
the right, it's a very privileged state, the science fiction, right?

17:49.820 --> 17:52.840
He can give lectures and he can tell people what to do and he can

17:52.840 --> 17:55.340
warn them, you know, in a very hectoring tone of voice.

17:56.040 --> 17:59.580
And if you can do all those things, it's a satisfactory way of getting from

17:59.580 --> 18:03.020
A to B, you know, a lot more satisfactory than working at McDonald's.
