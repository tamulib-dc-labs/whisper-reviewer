00:09.280 --> 00:13.380
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.360
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:38.180 --> 00:39.880
And here are your hosts.

00:45.180 --> 00:51.780
This is David Crute and Bill Vernon. Practicing physicist Robert L. Forwood is also a science fiction writer.

00:51.780 --> 00:58.700
After writing science fact articles in the magazines for almost 20 years, Forwood recently published his first science fiction novel,

00:59.100 --> 01:04.800
Dragon's Egg. When we asked Forwood how he began writing science fiction, he claimed he was tricked into doing it.

01:05.420 --> 01:10.240
But the way I got into actually writing fiction was Larry Niven tricked me.

01:11.100 --> 01:14.560
Here he explains how he innocently offered to help Larry Niven.

01:15.480 --> 01:20.680
Larry Niven and Jerry Purnell were running a lecture series at UCLA.

01:21.380 --> 01:31.960
Invited me to come and give a scientific talk on gravity as part of their series. It was how science fiction and science interact.

01:33.280 --> 01:45.860
And at the close of one of the sessions that Larry was talking on, he said he wanted to write a story about beings that lived on a neutron star.

01:46.040 --> 01:52.080
Frank Drake had mentioned this idea a number of years before. He said he really wanted to write that story.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.720
And that night at the cocktail party that they threw, I said, Larry, I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:56.720 --> 02:03.120
I will work up all the scientific details behind the story because I know a lot about neutron star physics.

02:03.860 --> 02:07.860
And it would be a fun story to read and I'd like to read hard science fiction.

02:08.580 --> 02:16.340
And what I'd like to do is give you enough facts so that you can write a really hard science fiction story without too many errors in it.

02:16.780 --> 02:21.860
When Forwood finished his part, Niven was still busy, so Forwood continued the work himself.

02:21.860 --> 02:26.840
And so I worked up all the science and gave him about 25, 30 pages of notes.

02:27.060 --> 02:34.880
And he said, gee, I'm busy right now working with Jerry Pornel on something called Lucifer's Hammer.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.560
And I'm pretty busy. I'll tell you what we'll do. Why don't we just sort of make this a collaboration.

02:40.120 --> 02:49.420
You may write the first draft of the story. And then I'll take it over from there and rewrite the thing.

02:49.420 --> 02:53.540
And you're not a writer, and I am. And that we will get the best of both worlds.

02:53.740 --> 02:57.700
Well, so I went back and wrote the first draft. And when I came back, he was still busy.

02:58.560 --> 03:03.580
And so I ended up finding out that I wanted to read this story.

03:04.160 --> 03:08.400
And the only way I could read that story was to write it first, so I had to write it.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.640
And so Larry and Niven tricked me into getting into science fiction.

03:22.360 --> 03:26.220
But Larry Niven didn't abandon Forwood after tricking him into writing a novel.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.840
He advised Forwood on many aspects, including a major plot element.

03:30.600 --> 03:40.920
Larry Niven basically gave the thousand to one, I mean excuse me, the million to one time difference.

03:44.180 --> 03:56.060
And the main thing that he brought out was the fact that the important part of the story was not all the science, which would have been in my tendency to write,

03:56.800 --> 04:06.700
but the problems of how do you communicate with somebody that lives and dies a million times faster than you do.

04:09.440 --> 04:21.120
And if those beings, since they would be thinking a million times faster than you, would figure out that you were there long before you could figure out they were there,

04:21.880 --> 04:27.420
and they had to figure out a way to communicate with you and signal you that they were there before you left.

04:28.380 --> 04:40.920
And so he mentioned the fact that, for instance, one somebody on the neutron star would have to climb a mountain and send a signal,

04:41.060 --> 04:43.980
and that might take them many generations.

04:45.860 --> 04:49.780
Actually, in the story I compressed it into one generation basically.

04:49.780 --> 04:58.700
But that was the kind of attitude that he brought toward the story that helped a lot.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.040
More on Robert Ford tomorrow.

05:08.460 --> 05:11.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:11.420 --> 05:14.080
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

05:14.080 --> 05:17.380
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.160
The next episode will be about the science fiction radio show.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.420
Stay with us!

06:22.680 --> 06:28.020
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.480
And here are your hosts.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.000
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

06:39.320 --> 06:45.400
In our last show we learned how Robert Ford was tricked into writing the manuscript which evolved into his novel, Dragon's Egg.

06:45.400 --> 06:51.900
Larry Niven helped forward flesh out his ideas, but it was Lester Del Rey who helped him polish the manuscript into a novel.

06:52.900 --> 07:02.220
My very first draft, of course, was quite rough from a writing point of view.

07:04.820 --> 07:09.160
And when Lester looked at it he saw some potential in it,

07:09.160 --> 07:16.020
but as it was, as the manuscript was sent to him, it wasn't acceptable, it wasn't a book.

07:17.280 --> 07:29.300
And he sat down and typed up 14 pages, single-spaced, of detailed criticism of the manuscript.

07:30.960 --> 07:39.780
And those 14 pages, when I followed them to the letter, and I don't think I disagreed with him on but say one or two things,

07:41.360 --> 07:50.500
when I went back through the manuscript and took his suggestions and then looked at the result, resultants,

07:50.500 --> 07:59.360
it began to be readable instead of being a science fact article, I guess.

08:00.080 --> 08:09.420
It had some flow, it had some characterization, but it still was a hard science fiction novel.

08:10.280 --> 08:16.780
In Dragon's Egg, Ford takes a hard science approach to a situation in which beings who inhabit a neutron star

08:16.780 --> 08:21.340
learn of the humans who are orbiting their star, then establish communications with them.

08:21.860 --> 08:25.260
The task is made difficult, though, by the fact that the aliens live at a pace

08:25.620 --> 08:28.020
roughly a million times faster than that of humans.

08:28.540 --> 08:33.180
Thus an individual alien, or chila, lives out its entire life in several human minutes.

08:33.920 --> 08:39.080
The chila, being native to a neutron star, with its intense gravitational and magnetic fields

08:39.080 --> 08:43.200
and extremely dense matter, are certainly constructed different from humans.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.940
Here Ford tells us about the aliens, their environment, and their names.

08:48.660 --> 08:55.780
Once I had placed my imagination and myself on the surface of the neutron star,

08:55.980 --> 09:08.100
now once I knew the territory well enough, and appreciated the fact that the light on this star comes from below, not above,

09:08.100 --> 09:12.720
but the sky is black, there's no light coming out of it except a few stars.

09:13.520 --> 09:22.060
Everything is a glow from below, and the territory is very flat because of the terrific gravity.

09:23.280 --> 09:35.120
I began to sort of appreciate what it was like there, and what I basically did was take the Indian technique

09:35.120 --> 09:44.040
of naming children about things that occurred shortly after they were born,

09:45.320 --> 09:51.320
and applied it to the chila, but put in a hyphen so it would take out the Indian context,

09:51.480 --> 09:59.440
and also, of course, a lot of the Indian things like eagles and feathers and the sky and things like that

09:59.440 --> 10:03.780
that don't exist, so I had to do that transfer.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.900
The chila's social structure differs from ours as well, though there are some similarities.

10:09.600 --> 10:17.900
Soon I began to realize that in my dreaming up of these creatures, I'd end up with a social structure

10:17.900 --> 10:24.840
that was sort of halfway between a Scottish clan and an Indian tribe,

10:25.900 --> 10:32.260
and as if both the Indians and the Scottish were crocodiles that laid eggs

10:32.840 --> 10:38.320
instead of having the problems of mammals that they had to take care of their young.

10:38.980 --> 10:45.140
The younger, immediately viable, and crocodiles and turtles, and so are the little tiny chila.

10:45.800 --> 10:54.200
So what I tried to do was imagine what it would be like if, instead of monkeys developing intelligent

10:54.200 --> 11:01.180
social interactions, crocodiles developed intelligent social interactions.

11:08.660 --> 11:13.920
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

11:13.920 --> 11:17.160
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

12:08.380 --> 12:11.540
The next episode will be about the science fiction radio show.

12:11.720 --> 12:12.760
Stay with us!

12:28.900 --> 12:34.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.660
And here are your hosts.

12:42.780 --> 12:45.040
This is David Cruz and Bill Vernon.

12:45.600 --> 12:50.640
Although science fiction is a literature ostensibly about science, the effects of technology,

12:50.640 --> 12:55.080
or a future where science is very much present, or in some cases very much absent,

12:55.700 --> 12:57.840
it is mainly written by non-scientists.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.760
Some writers do have undergraduate degrees in the sciences,

13:01.260 --> 13:05.740
Hull Anderson, Arthur C. Clark, Joe Haldeman, and Charles Harness, to name a few,

13:06.260 --> 13:09.320
and certainly most other writers have had some coursework in the sciences.

13:09.780 --> 13:12.500
But there are a few scientists who write science fiction.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.680
Practicing scientists who write it include Gregory Benford,

13:15.680 --> 13:22.060
John Slanzowski, Fred Hoyle, David Brinn and Tony Rothman, and a notable ex-scientist Isaac Esimov.

13:22.400 --> 13:26.260
Another practicing scientist who writes science fiction is physicist Robert Ford,

13:26.720 --> 13:29.160
whose novel Dragon's Egg we have discussed previously.

13:29.780 --> 13:34.060
We asked forward what enjoyment he reaps from being a scientist and writing science fiction.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.920
Writing is a process of selling science.

13:39.920 --> 13:45.960
I mean, I have always felt that part of my job as a scientist was to try and communicate

13:46.760 --> 13:50.980
the first, the facts of science, and second, the excitement of science

13:50.980 --> 13:56.000
to the general public that is not involved in science,

13:56.140 --> 14:05.400
because science is at the cutting edge of our intellectual achievements,

14:05.400 --> 14:10.440
whether it's physical sciences, chemical sciences, biological or social, or whatever sciences.

14:11.880 --> 14:18.260
This is where we're developing as an intelligent being.

14:19.700 --> 14:26.240
And we're learning more about the world around us and how we operate in that world.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.460
And it's very exciting to be involved in that.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.360
And you don't get much, many scientists, admitting that it's exciting, but it is.

14:34.360 --> 14:41.200
I mean, it's part of the reasons you get professors working at wages less than they would if they were a plumber.

14:41.580 --> 14:48.860
It is more fun to be a scientist, but most of them are so hidebound and so concerned about their image,

14:49.260 --> 14:51.240
but they don't want to admit that they're having fun.

14:51.400 --> 14:56.120
Well, I admit I'm having fun being a scientist, and I think it's fun.

14:56.320 --> 15:03.240
I think that's fun and the excitement, and everything else can be communicated to the general public

15:03.240 --> 15:13.280
so that their awareness of the fact that they're part of an intellectual and evolutionary advance as an intelligent being

15:14.860 --> 15:18.020
can be given to them.

15:18.140 --> 15:25.940
And I think that's one of the reasons why we have such a spurt of magazines today, like Omni and Science 80,

15:25.940 --> 15:31.280
and the Smithsonian and others that have, and the Discovery.

15:32.120 --> 15:42.060
All of these magazines are beginning to realize that people want to be part of the leading edge of our cultural evolution.

15:42.880 --> 15:48.540
And I found that I have the ability to communicate that.

15:48.540 --> 15:54.820
Now, for many years, I would only write science articles, not fiction.

15:55.460 --> 15:57.420
I wouldn't have a story.

15:57.940 --> 16:03.400
I'd just say, here's something interesting I found at the Outskirts of Science, and isn't it wonderful,

16:03.560 --> 16:07.420
and isn't it great, and I'd write it down to whatever level was there.

16:08.440 --> 16:14.420
And those were science speculation articles, but I'm sold in analog and Omni in places like that.

16:14.420 --> 16:19.820
And I finding that doing it in the form of fiction reaches more people.

16:24.040 --> 16:24.560
Music

16:38.140 --> 16:42.800
Although Ford is becoming better known in the science fiction community because of Dragon's Egg,

16:43.120 --> 16:47.620
he has been in the field for many years writing science fact articles for the science fiction magazines.

16:47.620 --> 16:52.120
Certainly, science fiction benefits when people with not only the scientific background,

16:52.220 --> 16:55.200
but the enthusiasm of Robert Forward contribute to it.

16:56.240 --> 16:56.740
Music

17:02.320 --> 17:07.820
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

17:08.220 --> 17:11.200
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.220
Music

17:47.080 --> 17:47.620
Music

17:52.740 --> 17:56.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:01.200 --> 18:01.920
Music

18:12.740 --> 18:18.220
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:19.000 --> 18:19.440
Music

18:26.940 --> 18:28.200
This is Daryl Lane.

18:28.360 --> 18:29.040
And David Carson.

18:29.540 --> 18:33.380
One of the most unique of all science fiction novels is Norman Spinrad's The Iron Dream.

18:33.920 --> 18:38.060
Though Spinrad did indeed write the book, he presents it as if it were written by Adolf Hitler.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.640
Spinrad bases the book on a provocative supposition.

18:42.060 --> 18:45.060
Suppose Hitler, instead of leading the Nazi party to power in Germany,

18:45.060 --> 18:47.740
had come to this country and become a science fiction writer.

18:48.140 --> 18:49.340
What kind of books would he have written?

18:50.120 --> 18:52.160
The Iron Dream is Spinrad's answer to that question.

18:52.620 --> 18:55.100
He wrote the book exactly as he believes Hitler would have.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.440
Spinrad says it was a difficult book to write.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.840
Because in order to write that book, I had to write like Hitler.

19:01.760 --> 19:06.040
And in order to get to that point, I had to read everything that Hitler had written,

19:06.940 --> 19:08.360
which is very boring indeed.

19:09.060 --> 19:12.820
And I had to also read a book called Hitler's Dinner Conversations,

19:12.920 --> 19:15.540
like 800 pages of Hitler's babbling to the dinner table,

19:15.560 --> 19:18.580
which was taken down to short in by Martin Borman, a fascinating book.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.680
But in order to write the bulk of that book, Hitler's novel, inside the book,

19:23.260 --> 19:24.300
I had a write like Hitler.

19:24.460 --> 19:25.900
I had to get inside Hitler's head.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.000
That was not what I could consider a fun experience.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.840
And so it was a very difficult book to write.

19:33.840 --> 19:40.540
And kind of a shattering book to write because of the kind of position I put myself in.

19:41.260 --> 19:42.980
Also, of course, Hitler was a terrible writer.

19:43.920 --> 19:47.060
In order to be accurate, I really had to write something awful in a way.

19:47.800 --> 19:52.640
And I was trying to, you know, also Hitler was getting crazier and crazier as he's writing the book.

19:52.740 --> 19:55.020
So I got crazier and crazier as I was writing the book.

20:05.240 --> 20:09.320
Hitler's main character is Farrick Jagger, a sword and sorcery type hero.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.380
Jagger fights to preserve the racial purity of humanity

20:12.380 --> 20:14.800
against hordes of genetically inferior mutants.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.640
And in every way, SpinRed tries to create a novel

20:17.640 --> 20:20.640
like Pulp Science fiction writer with Hitler's political and racial views

20:20.640 --> 20:22.540
and writing skills would have produced.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.500
The book, of course, is a classic, anti-fascist novel.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.660
We asked SpinRed if anyone had ever completely misunderstood it

20:28.660 --> 20:30.020
and thought he was admiring Hitler.

20:30.920 --> 20:36.400
No, the only kind of misunderstanding that I read in the review that I really got

20:36.400 --> 20:37.740
was a little bit different.

20:37.860 --> 20:41.340
It was somebody who said, well, this is really well good fun, you know.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.360
I really enjoyed this book.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.600
Why don't you have to muck it up with all this stuff about Hitler

20:44.600 --> 20:49.180
and all the extraneous paraphernalia, just a good, you know, rousing adventure tale?

20:50.980 --> 20:54.280
That is the only kind of misreading of the book that's really taken place.

20:54.840 --> 20:59.780
Actually, I have not been calling off your fascist point, anyone, that I know of.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.160
That's the connection with that book.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.320
SpinRed explains where the idea for such a unique experiment came from.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.500
Well, the impetus came from our conversation with Mike Wilcock in London

21:17.500 --> 21:20.940
where I was living at the time about how he wrote Sword and Sorcery

21:23.120 --> 21:29.580
and how he used Freudian imagery and, you know, the basic, you know,

21:29.580 --> 21:31.380
the basic appeal of Sword and Sorcery.

21:31.520 --> 21:38.140
And that gave me the idea that if Hitler had not, you know, become a Fuhrer of Germany,

21:38.260 --> 21:41.200
he could have as well winded up writing Sword and Sorcery.

21:42.180 --> 21:49.120
And I've always been, you know, fascinated with the whole question of how a thing like nonsense

21:49.120 --> 21:50.100
could really happen.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.860
And none of the stuff I had read about that really satisfied me, you know,

21:53.880 --> 21:56.940
political or economic or conventional explanations of how this happened.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.460
And the two things came together.

22:00.620 --> 22:04.180
And I, you know, had my insight about Nazism was that it was a psychosexual phenomenon

22:04.180 --> 22:08.380
that had looked into power by, in effect, manipulating imagery

22:11.360 --> 22:16.100
and psychosexual substructures rather than bio-coherent economic program and so forth.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.300
And so that was the base.

22:17.440 --> 22:21.540
And then, you know, this had a certain correlation with certain kind of Sword and Sorcery

22:21.540 --> 22:24.800
and that was the basic impetus that generated the book.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.680
The Iron Dream was published in 1972.

22:28.220 --> 22:32.960
It won the pre-Apollo Award in France and was recently reissued in this country by Timescape Books.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.820
And when it was first published in Germany not too long ago, it was banned.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.480
We'll have that story next time.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:48.580 --> 22:51.180
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:51.180 --> 22:54.420
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:21.180 --> 23:51.160
The Science Fiction Radio Show

23:51.160 --> 23:54.580
And next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:10.480 --> 24:15.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.160
And here are your hosts.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.700
This is David Carson.

24:25.960 --> 24:26.620
And Daryl Lane.

24:26.980 --> 24:31.980
Early in 1982, Norman Spinrad's Science Fiction novel, The Iron Dream, was totally banned in Germany.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.600
As we explained last time, the book is an anti-fascist novel.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.380
Though Spinrad pretends the book was written by Adolf Hitler,

24:38.700 --> 24:42.040
it is actually a brilliant criticism of the political and racial views held by Hitler.

24:42.600 --> 24:46.220
Spinrad says the book has been well received in all the countries where it's been published.

25:12.040 --> 25:16.920
And it's been extensively reviewed in about eight different countries.

25:17.780 --> 25:22.000
There's no, I have no, no instance where the book was misunderstood

25:22.860 --> 25:26.780
and was taken as anything but an anti-nazis and anti-fascist novel.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.760
Throughout the world.

25:35.720 --> 25:40.420
We asked Spinrad if anyone could possibly misunderstand his intentions in The Iron Dream.

25:42.040 --> 25:42.480
He said he didn't understand any.

25:42.740 --> 25:49.260
I mean, you know, Hinkley certainly misunderstood St. Taxi driver.

25:49.380 --> 25:53.200
So there's always schizophrenics and maniacs around who can misunderstand anything.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.600
I mean, David Harwitz heard demons in his head.

25:56.760 --> 26:01.660
I mean, there are always completely crazy people who can read things out of something that were never in there.

26:02.220 --> 26:08.060
So if you wanted two people around, you know, psychotics who could get anything out of any book.

26:08.060 --> 26:11.100
But I don't, I, see, the book is written on two levels.

26:11.280 --> 26:16.180
The sophisticated readers, they understand what it is to begin with.

26:16.800 --> 26:20.360
The other level is that the kind of people who are into things like Perry Rodin

26:20.360 --> 26:25.420
and that kind of proto-fascist science fantasy

26:25.420 --> 26:29.680
would start off reading the book, maybe identifying with Farrick Jagger,

26:30.240 --> 26:34.300
you know, a third of the way into it, and suddenly realizing what it is they're identifying with.

26:34.300 --> 26:39.040
And so it becomes a kind of deprogramming experience for the kind of people that they claim would be harmed.

26:39.260 --> 26:43.220
I think it would be a very strongly anti-Nazi book

26:43.220 --> 26:48.120
precisely for those kinds of young people who might have leanings in that direction

26:48.120 --> 26:52.060
because they would then be confronted with what it is that they're really identifying with.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.440
We also asked Spinrad what his reaction to the band was.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.380
My reaction to the band is very complicated.

26:58.600 --> 27:02.920
First of all, it took ten years to get this book published in Germany.

27:03.740 --> 27:06.660
All my French friends said it would never be published in Germany.

27:07.800 --> 27:12.260
So when a Heineberg, you know, summing up the courage to publish it, I was very pleased

27:12.260 --> 27:17.780
and I thought that this was going to, you know, that this represented a kind of maturity on the part of Germany

27:17.780 --> 27:19.600
that they're willing to look at this stuff.

27:19.900 --> 27:22.940
And I felt very good about it being published there and I was a bit surprised.

27:23.860 --> 27:29.580
Now that it's banned, obviously I feel that, well, the book says it all.

27:29.580 --> 27:32.580
Well, the book itself, in a way, is about why it was banned

27:33.920 --> 27:37.260
because it's the same sort of mentality that goes around banning books

27:38.760 --> 27:43.180
that resulted in a different kind of way in the Third Reich.

27:44.260 --> 27:50.140
It's not to say that all Germans are like this because the publisher has fought this all the way and is continuing to find it.

27:50.640 --> 27:55.840
Most of the German newspapers, there's been a lot of coverage of support of the book against the band.

27:57.660 --> 28:05.560
The German chapter of World SF had a vote and issued a public statement against the band in supporting the book.

28:08.320 --> 28:15.180
So, you know, I think it's a very retrogressive thing and it says something about, I suppose, the German political and social system

28:15.180 --> 28:20.840
is that they do not understand the concept that is embodied in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

28:22.060 --> 28:27.120
And it's a particularly pernicious law because anything can be banned under this law

28:27.760 --> 28:32.120
or under the ground that it's not fit for children, even if it's not intended for children.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.840
Which is exactly the kind of thing that the moral majority is trying to do here,

28:37.620 --> 28:39.800
which tells you what kind of people they are, too.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:49.900 --> 28:55.700
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:09.800 --> 29:19.930
Thank you.
