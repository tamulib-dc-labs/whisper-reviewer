00:01.220 --> 00:02.460
Okay, the tape is rolling.

00:04.980 --> 00:09.760
Okay, first of all, could you tell me if you, as a youngster, did you come from the fan

00:09.760 --> 00:11.100
structure in science fiction?

00:11.960 --> 00:20.200
No, my experience with science fiction was very solitary for most of my period of growing

00:20.200 --> 00:20.600
up.

00:21.370 --> 00:26.300
I discovered the area of the fantastic.

00:27.260 --> 00:35.140
I think I can trace back to when I was eight or nine years old, when I found some old Edgar

00:35.140 --> 00:39.220
Riceboro's novels in my grandmother's back closet.

00:40.570 --> 00:46.640
And one by one read them and became entranced by it.

00:47.600 --> 00:57.260
That was followed by a period during the 30s when the pulp adventure magazines were at

00:57.260 --> 00:58.000
their height.

00:59.180 --> 01:09.380
And my father and his brothers, my uncles, would buy these 10 cent magazines and bring

01:09.380 --> 01:10.680
them home and I would read them.

01:11.200 --> 01:21.240
Mostly they seemed to prefer the pulp hero magazines like Doc Savage and Operator Number

01:21.240 --> 01:26.980
Five and The Spider and The Shadow and magazines of this kind, which I, you know, G8 is battle

01:26.980 --> 01:27.300
aces.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.720
But eventually I discovered a second hand magazine store in Kansas City where I was

01:34.720 --> 01:36.120
born and grew up.

01:36.860 --> 01:40.700
And when I finished reading the magazines, I'd take them down to this magazine store

01:40.700 --> 01:45.940
and trade them for science fiction magazines, which I then devoured.

01:47.200 --> 01:52.420
So I grew up not really knowing any other science fiction readers.

01:52.980 --> 01:57.360
My brother, older brother, read a little, but not with the enthusiasm that I did.

01:58.480 --> 02:11.140
So my first contact with other readers, much less other writers, was after I'd been writing

02:11.140 --> 02:12.120
for four years.

02:12.740 --> 02:19.380
I was aware that there was this fan structure because in some of the magazines like Starling

02:19.380 --> 02:26.820
Stories and Throwing Wonder Stories, and even in A Sounding, there would be letter columns

02:27.200 --> 02:28.560
with the names of people.

02:28.720 --> 02:34.340
Gradually I began to recognize a few of them and I realized that there were other readers.

02:36.220 --> 02:45.480
But it wasn't until I attended the World Science Fiction Convention of 1952, which was held

02:45.480 --> 02:53.780
in Chicago, and I was urged to go by the company I worked for at that time, a paperback

02:53.780 --> 02:59.420
publishing house for whom I was supposed to be their science fiction expert, and they

02:59.420 --> 03:06.880
suggested that they'd pay my way if I went to the somewhat old 60, 80 miles down from

03:06.880 --> 03:10.100
the scene of the consulate in Chicago and attend the convention to make context.

03:10.920 --> 03:19.400
And that was my first experience with really meeting other readers and other writers and

03:19.400 --> 03:24.760
agents and editors in the whole paraphernalia of the science fiction world.

03:26.900 --> 03:27.820
Okay, good.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.400
Can you recall the circumstances?

03:30.860 --> 03:33.620
I believe it was in 1949 of your first published story.

03:34.580 --> 03:45.620
Yes, I was, had read science fiction, as I said, from all about the age of eight or nine,

03:45.620 --> 03:49.740
and read it seriously for a while during the middle thirties.

03:50.560 --> 03:57.020
And at the age of about fifteen or sixteen, I had written some science fiction stories,

03:57.140 --> 04:01.540
though with no particular skill.

04:02.160 --> 04:07.320
And I usually, like most beginning writers, didn't even finish most of them.

04:07.340 --> 04:08.900
I can only remember one that I finished.

04:11.640 --> 04:18.460
But then the college came along and the war came along, and I got involved in both of

04:18.460 --> 04:18.780
them.

04:19.280 --> 04:25.400
And it wasn't until after I'd come back from service and gotten my bachelor's degree and

04:25.400 --> 04:34.860
had actually had about a year of graduate study that I decided to try full-time writing.

04:35.500 --> 04:42.280
I had been interested in theater playwriting, but finally decided I didn't want to get a

04:42.280 --> 04:45.980
degree in that in the speech and theater area.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.500
But I was fascinated by the notion of radio writing.

04:51.260 --> 04:56.960
So I returned from Northwestern University to Kansas City with the notion of writing

04:56.960 --> 05:05.520
a series of half-hour radio dramas based on Kansas City history and getting some local

05:05.520 --> 05:07.280
radio station to produce them.

05:08.040 --> 05:13.880
And I actually wrote four of these and did the research for them and so forth, and then

05:13.880 --> 05:17.720
went around to the radio stations and found out that not any of them were interested.

05:18.520 --> 05:25.880
So I had a wife to support, and I sat down and wrote the kind of thing that I'd been

05:25.880 --> 05:34.160
reading all this time, first time seriously, and wrote a story called Paradox, which I

05:34.160 --> 05:37.420
sent off to astounding and astounding Senate back.

05:37.560 --> 05:42.340
And I sent it off to amazing and amazing Senate back, and I sent it off to Throwing

05:42.340 --> 05:49.280
Wonder Stories, which was the third magazine that, and starting stories, were published

05:49.280 --> 05:51.660
by the same chain.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.560
And one day I got a letter back saying, I like your story, Paradox, and I'll pay you

05:56.560 --> 05:59.820
$80 for it, so I thought Marvelous.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.980
I'd really stumbled onto something that was tremendous.

06:05.180 --> 06:09.580
And so I meanwhile had been writing another story, which was a story called Communication.

06:10.700 --> 06:15.600
And I created it the same way, sent it off to astounding first, and I think maybe I sent

06:15.600 --> 06:23.280
it off second after I got rejected by astounding to Throwing Wonder Stories, and the same editor,

06:23.900 --> 06:28.840
Sam Merwin Jr. brought it, and that was the story which happened to be published first

06:28.840 --> 06:39.740
in Starling Stories in September of 1949, where the first story I actually wrote with

06:39.740 --> 06:45.700
Paradox was published the following month in Throwing Wonder Stories in 19th and October.

06:47.560 --> 06:51.420
You didn't have to go through a long process of getting rejection slips, then did you?

06:51.540 --> 07:00.460
No, as a matter of fact, sometimes when I talk to aspiring young writers and they turn

07:00.460 --> 07:06.920
to me and they say, how many rejection slips did you get before you finally sold a story?

07:07.540 --> 07:12.020
And I look a little sheepish because I know it's not the answer they want.

07:12.640 --> 07:19.500
And I said, I sold the first story ever really wrote, seriously, and their faces fall, and

07:19.500 --> 07:26.280
then I followed up immediately by saying, but of course Ray Bradbury had 75 to 100 stories

07:26.280 --> 07:27.740
rejected before he sold one.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.420
And look what he got to.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.660
Yeah, okay. This next question, I'm not quite sure how to phrase it, but I've always been

07:36.660 --> 07:44.700
fascinated by the split in your relationship to science fiction. It seems to me that you

07:44.700 --> 07:50.100
must have at one time made a decision to be an academic and to be a writer at the same

07:50.100 --> 07:53.820
time. I wonder if that was a hard decision or if you ever considered full time writing

07:53.820 --> 07:54.920
or what you did.

07:55.060 --> 08:01.440
I did, as a matter of fact, write full time for a period of a little more than three years,

08:01.440 --> 08:14.360
a year in 1948-49. And I went back to school then and got a master's degree, but I continued

08:14.360 --> 08:23.100
to write. And then after I'd worked for this paperback publisher, after I got my master's

08:23.100 --> 08:28.100
degree, worked for a paperback publisher for a year and a half, I found out that I'd sold

08:28.100 --> 08:32.800
four stories that I hadn't known about and decided to go back to full time writing. So

08:32.800 --> 08:46.900
I did write full time from the fall of 1942 until the late summer of 1955. And really

08:47.680 --> 08:56.020
much of the groundwork for the later books that I published and the success that I had,

08:56.020 --> 09:01.740
I think, especially it was, was based upon that freelance period. I didn't make a lot

09:01.740 --> 09:08.820
of money at it, very, you know, below the poverty level. But my needs were fairly simple

09:08.820 --> 09:16.880
at that time and what it later paid off in the sense that the stories that I wrote appeared

09:16.880 --> 09:25.480
in books and some of them even were made in the movies and all that sort of thing. And

09:25.480 --> 09:33.880
I would have thought I was very well off indeed. But it was after 1955 or in the fall of 1955,

09:35.240 --> 09:39.860
after my wife and I had moved back to Lawrence, Kansas, simply as a place to live, that I got

09:39.860 --> 09:47.640
involved almost by accident with teaching at the university from which I'd gotten my

09:47.640 --> 09:53.720
two degrees, the University of Kansas, and became involved with other aspects of the

09:53.720 --> 10:00.260
university, edited the alumni magazine for three years, and then became director of public

10:00.260 --> 10:06.420
relations for the university for 12 years before returning to full time teaching and

10:06.420 --> 10:17.100
writing in 1970. But looking back upon it, I know I think right from the beginning I

10:17.100 --> 10:25.960
had the feeling that I wanted to do criticism in the area. My first 10 stories, for instance,

10:26.200 --> 10:34.440
were published under a pseudonym of Edwin James using, I began to use my own name with

10:34.440 --> 10:43.480
the 11th story. But the reason that I can remember now for doing that was the fact that

10:43.480 --> 10:49.080
I thought I would write criticism about science fiction and I wanted to save my real name

10:49.080 --> 10:56.720
for that. But after 10 stories I decided that was foolish and I ought to use my real name

10:57.240 --> 11:06.380
for everything. But looking back upon it, I think the academic interest was there right

11:06.380 --> 11:06.980
from the beginning.

11:08.980 --> 11:13.180
Okay, that's interesting. I want to ask you obviously a couple questions at least on your

11:13.180 --> 11:18.280
criticism, but first could you give me a sort of a brief overview of the things that

11:19.020 --> 11:23.440
you do at the University of Kansas that involve science fiction? I imagine it's probably one

11:23.440 --> 11:27.820
of the most active university science fiction programs in the country, if not the most active.

11:28.100 --> 11:34.520
We have a lot of things going on. I've been fortunate to have found a colleague here,

11:35.320 --> 11:41.780
Stephen Goldman, who is interested in science fiction, although his basic academic discipline

11:41.780 --> 11:51.620
is the medieval period. It's a strange phenomenon I think that a great many science fiction

11:53.480 --> 12:03.500
academicians have their expertise as medievalists. I don't know what the connection is, but I

12:03.500 --> 12:09.600
suspect that there is one. But we also, because of our interest here, I think have attracted

12:09.600 --> 12:14.600
some graduate students who are interested in the area, some of whom have gotten degrees,

12:15.200 --> 12:22.620
not in science fiction because we don't offer one, but in science fiction related areas.

12:23.200 --> 12:31.080
I have one graduate student now who's doing his dissertation on my work and another one

12:31.080 --> 12:39.580
who graduated last year who did a creative dissertation of a book of science fiction

12:39.600 --> 12:50.160
stories. So we have had that body of graduate students who have taught science fiction classes

12:50.640 --> 12:59.900
at the sophomore level as one of the required courses in composition and literature. I also

12:59.900 --> 13:07.040
traditionally teach a science fiction course, an undergraduate and graduate science fiction

13:07.040 --> 13:12.880
course each year, although my primary duties in the English department are the teaching

13:12.880 --> 13:22.300
of fiction writing. Perhaps our most interesting science fiction offering, however, is the

13:22.300 --> 13:29.260
three week intensive English institute on the teaching of science fiction that we offer

13:29.260 --> 13:37.020
in the summer. We realized a number of years ago that there were a lot of people facing

13:37.040 --> 13:44.500
these with the task, sometimes self-assumed, sometimes assigned, of teaching a science

13:44.500 --> 13:53.800
fiction course. And they were largely unprepared because there had been no academic program

13:53.800 --> 14:01.860
on science fiction, certainly not on the teaching of science fiction. So we set up this intensive

14:02.320 --> 14:15.480
three week workshop to offer teachers the opportunity to attend and get a six-hour, six-credited

14:15.480 --> 14:23.720
hour program in science fiction, in all aspects of science fiction, in just three weeks. It's

14:23.720 --> 14:29.960
very intensive experience. We bring in several science fiction writers besides myself. This

14:29.960 --> 14:37.440
year we're having Gordon Dixon and Theodore Sturgeon, Frederick Cole, and it has been a

14:37.440 --> 14:48.360
most successful and satisfying experience. This summer the institute will be held from

14:48.360 --> 14:50.980
July 5th to July 23rd.

14:53.380 --> 14:59.940
Okay. By the way, I am a medievalist myself too. That is kind of strange, but I think

14:59.960 --> 15:01.720
my field is medieval literature too.

15:01.820 --> 15:02.200
Is that right?

15:02.420 --> 15:02.580
Yeah.

15:02.960 --> 15:07.800
Why do you think medievalists are attracted to it?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.880
I don't know. I never thought of it until you just mentioned it.

15:11.080 --> 15:17.580
I know half a dozen people. Tom Shippey, who is an English medievalist, who teaches now

15:17.580 --> 15:26.760
at Leeds University. I know the editor of pocketbook science fiction, David Harkwell,

15:27.060 --> 15:36.980
is a medievalist with a PhD in medieval literature. I think there must be a number of others.

15:37.920 --> 15:48.160
I think my own feeling is that medieval literature perhaps requires the same kinds of world construction

15:48.960 --> 15:56.440
of imagination and building up an entirely new world out of different concepts, much

15:56.440 --> 16:01.040
like science fiction. At least that is the theory that I am proposing.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.780
That is interesting. I never thought of it.

16:06.480 --> 16:10.860
We teach a class here at Odessa College and we use the Road to Science Fiction series,

16:11.160 --> 16:16.240
which I consider to be a very valuable and unique endeavor. It is something we needed.

16:17.380 --> 16:23.360
I would like to ask you just a couple of questions on that. First of all, was there any sort of,

16:23.360 --> 16:28.160
for that particular approach to science fiction, was there any kind of impetus or idea that

16:28.160 --> 16:34.600
caused you to start that series? Maybe it would be best to give you a kind of

16:34.600 --> 16:42.280
history of its development. When I first went back to full time teaching, I had been asked

16:42.280 --> 16:47.250
if I would teach a science fiction course, which is different from the experience at

16:47.250 --> 16:57.070
most universities, where there is some resistance to the notion of doing that. I accepted because

16:57.070 --> 17:02.690
I had the feeling that there wasn't a good history of science fiction and that this course

17:02.690 --> 17:14.510
would give me the incentive to write it. I sat down and wrote very fast and ended up

17:14.510 --> 17:28.310
with 13 chapters representing about 13 lectures for the 14-week semester. These chapters, or

17:28.310 --> 17:36.950
these lectures, became the 13 chapters in a book of mine, which appeared in about, I

17:36.950 --> 17:44.490
guess, 75, after some delays. As Alternate Worlds, the illustrated history of science fiction

17:46.690 --> 17:52.590
and it did reasonably well. There were some problems with its publication, so forth, including

17:52.590 --> 17:58.450
the delays, but it is still remembered today in spite of being out of print as being one

17:58.450 --> 18:07.150
of the best histories of science fiction, complimenting Brian Aldous's Billion Year

18:07.150 --> 18:11.330
Spree, which he was doing at the same time, but his book came out a couple years earlier.

18:12.210 --> 18:18.930
But as a one consequence of its publication, I got a call one day from an editor at New

18:18.930 --> 18:27.390
American Library who was admiring it and asked me if I'd like to do a book for them. My

18:27.390 --> 18:33.970
initial reaction was that I felt that we needed a good collection of essays about science

18:33.970 --> 18:43.710
fiction. And I proposed a book of these. Rather fortunately, I think for me it was turned

18:43.710 --> 18:51.810
down at New American Library and they said they'd rather have some stories. And I knew

18:51.810 --> 19:03.950
also that I really felt the need for anthologies, which covered more than the brief span of

19:04.830 --> 19:12.130
the 20s to the 60s, which most anthologies did and there really wasn't much in the 20s

19:12.130 --> 19:21.190
or 30s, most of it, covered the period of the 40s and 50s. So I said yes and I sent them

19:21.190 --> 19:29.790
a proposal for the first volume of the Road Science Fiction. At that time, all we knew

19:29.790 --> 19:38.070
that there would be would be one volume, which covered the period from the earliest pre-history

19:38.610 --> 19:49.350
of literature, not to mention science fiction, up to 1900 and the H. G. Wells Early Stories

19:49.350 --> 19:56.490
and Novel. By the time I got finished with the manuscript, I had felt that it really,

19:57.170 --> 20:01.490
unlike most books, came out even better than I thought it was going to. And I proposed that

20:01.490 --> 20:08.390
we go ahead with a second and third volume. They said, let's wait and see how this does.

20:09.090 --> 20:18.070
And eventually after it had done better than they thought, they agreed that I could go

20:18.070 --> 20:26.470
on to volume two and three, which covered the period from 1900 to the 20th century.

20:29.090 --> 20:40.330
And then from 1940 to 1970 or 70, actually the latest point, 76, I think. And I did those

20:40.330 --> 20:45.670
together. But by the time I got to the third volume, I realized that I wasn't going to

20:45.670 --> 20:50.590
be able to get in everything that I wanted and suggested we go ahead to a fourth volume,

20:50.590 --> 20:58.290
but they said, well, let's wait and see how these do. As a consequence, however, of the

20:58.290 --> 21:03.890
fact that these did very well, were well accepted, they finally agreed that I go ahead to the

21:03.890 --> 21:11.530
fourth volume. And I've just completed that, sent in the manuscript. And the fourth volume

21:11.530 --> 21:18.430
wrote science fiction is scheduled to appear in October of this year. And it will cover

21:18.430 --> 21:29.910
the period overlapping a little bit with the volume three, the period from 1950 to 1981.

21:32.590 --> 21:41.350
The last volume is going to be a little different from the first three, however. The first three

21:41.350 --> 21:48.410
are on a historical basis as I've introduced. And I think that's a good point. And I think

21:48.430 --> 21:55.290
it's indicated, and you have noted, with much of the emphasis being on the development of

21:55.290 --> 22:04.530
science fiction and the stories generally selected for the ones which were important

22:04.530 --> 22:12.970
in the development of science fiction or typical of a certain period or a certain style, in

22:12.970 --> 22:18.570
the more current story, this is much more difficult to determine. You can't really say

22:18.570 --> 22:25.790
what stories are important until much after they've been published. And you can't certainly

22:25.790 --> 22:32.550
say which are typical until you decide what the period really stands for. So what I did

22:32.550 --> 22:41.790
in the fourth volume was to select stories that I thought dealt with the literary uses

22:41.790 --> 22:48.510
of science fiction. And so that the volume is primarily concerned not with questions of

22:48.510 --> 22:52.290
generic importance, but the question of literary uses.

22:54.930 --> 22:58.610
Okay, that was a very complete answer. In fact, you probably got a couple of my next

22:58.610 --> 23:07.530
questions with that one. Let's see, could you just say in volume one, could you briefly

23:07.530 --> 23:12.390
comment on, I think the idea or the concept behind that particular volume was that before

23:12.390 --> 23:16.390
science fiction could exist that man had to discover that there was a future and there

23:16.390 --> 23:19.730
was such a thing as progress. Could you briefly explain that?

23:19.990 --> 23:26.630
Yes, it seems to me that the essential nature of science fiction is that it deals with change.

23:27.550 --> 23:34.430
In fact, in order for us to recognize a story or a novel as being science fiction, we have

23:35.100 --> 23:43.990
to identify that part of it which is different from here and now, our everyday world. And

23:43.990 --> 23:55.910
so it deals with how people would react in changed circumstances. So up to approximately

23:55.910 --> 24:02.850
the time of the Industrial Revolution, the very concept of change itself was alien to

24:03.290 --> 24:10.170
human minds. For most of humanity's history, it seems to me, and of course as a medievalist,

24:10.650 --> 24:22.270
maybe I'm venturing into your area, but it seems to me, looking back over the history

24:22.270 --> 24:32.830
of humanity, that mostly people saw change as being only the eternal source of change.

24:32.850 --> 24:41.050
It's not just the circle of the seasons changing from spring to summer to fall to winter and

24:41.050 --> 24:47.890
back again, or if there was change in people's circumstances, it was usually change for the

24:47.890 --> 24:54.650
worst. And as a kind of, that is, you know, something, the king would die and the empire

24:54.650 --> 25:02.070
would be thrown into turmoil or there would be a war lost or won or barbarians would

25:03.370 --> 25:10.210
come in pillaging and burning and killing and other kinds of terrible things or there

25:10.210 --> 25:18.610
would be drought or plagues or all sorts of bad things. But so as a consequence, throughout

25:18.610 --> 25:25.730
most of man's history that if there have been legends and myths of a golden age which man

25:25.730 --> 25:35.670
once existed in and which, from which humanity has been expexpelled or has degenerated or

25:35.670 --> 25:43.790
deteriorated, and it wasn't until the investor revolution and of course the scientific perceptions

25:44.090 --> 25:53.310
that preceded it and accompanied it, and which began to create change that people saw could

25:53.310 --> 26:00.330
be beneficial and in which they could, over which they might be able to exercise some control.

26:00.590 --> 26:09.450
That is, it was man made change created by human desires and intelligence and it could

26:09.450 --> 26:18.090
be controlled by humanity's exercise of intelligence. And it seems to me that science fiction was

26:18.090 --> 26:22.490
the literary response to that recognition.

26:25.330 --> 26:31.070
Fine, okay. I've noted that in each volume you seem to have a, you know, a unifying concept,

26:31.170 --> 26:35.870
like for the second volume it would be the idea that man had to consider himself as a

26:35.870 --> 26:42.290
species in science fiction. The third was that we have to have an open mind about the universe

26:42.290 --> 26:47.430
and man's fate for science fiction to exist. Does the fourth volume have that kind of unifying

26:47.430 --> 26:48.690
idea behind it and what would it be?

26:49.050 --> 27:01.590
No, what it deals with and those themes really kind of happened in the first three volumes

27:02.430 --> 27:17.410
and when you run into coincidences like that you feel like something is going right. It

27:17.410 --> 27:23.630
was an introduction to volume one and I realized as I wrote this introduction that I was setting

27:23.630 --> 27:30.950
down three basic requirements and that these basic requirements for the existence of science

27:30.950 --> 27:45.670
fiction, the recognition of humanity as a species and so forth, somehow fit in with my concept

27:45.670 --> 27:50.630
of how science fiction had developed and so from there I picked it up for volume two and

27:50.630 --> 27:59.870
volume three but I think in this current one the genre already has been established by

27:59.870 --> 28:08.990
the time we come to 1950 and that now the major considerations are not generic so much

28:08.990 --> 28:15.690
as how are we going to write it, how are we going to express the ideas and what ideas

28:15.690 --> 28:21.690
are we going to express considering the fact that we already have a genre to deal with.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.910
How are the first three volumes sold?

28:29.230 --> 28:37.150
Reasonably well for this kind of book, the mentor books at New American Library are

28:39.730 --> 28:45.030
intended to be primarily academic books, they also issue them on the mass market but they

28:45.030 --> 28:52.070
don't expect a major sale on them and all three of them at the present time or as of

28:52.070 --> 28:58.950
six months ago, all three of them have already sold over 30,000 copies each and they will

28:59.790 --> 29:03.750
keep them in print, sometimes expect to sell more of course, particularly with the issuance

29:03.750 --> 29:11.410
of the fourth volume but they expect the average mentor book only sells about 20,000 so it's

29:11.410 --> 29:15.490
already done, all of them have done 50% better than the average book.

29:18.490 --> 29:22.790
This is sort of a general question, feel free to answer it as briefly as you'd like.

29:23.610 --> 29:28.590
Why do you think there's a need, I think you do think there is, a need for science fiction

29:28.590 --> 29:29.850
criticism and scholarship?

29:33.730 --> 29:42.590
I think that a category of fiction like science fiction, I hate to continue to use the word

29:42.590 --> 29:49.970
genre because it's not really traditionally a genre, it is a set of conventions and a

29:49.970 --> 29:58.570
set of expectations but in this particular area which has largely been ignored, it's

29:58.590 --> 30:07.170
by the apparatus of criticism in this country and in other parts of the world as well because

30:07.170 --> 30:14.050
it's not been considered important enough to merit criticism, it's considered to be

30:14.050 --> 30:22.410
a pulp literature, a popular literature and in a sense beneath criticism and as a consequence

30:22.410 --> 30:33.950
it has developed largely under its own impetus without any kind of efforts of critical minds

30:33.950 --> 30:40.350
to look at it and try to appraise it, say what's good and what's bad according to

30:40.350 --> 30:52.390
some kind of standards that can be established and as well to teach the help of the media

30:52.410 --> 31:02.170
and other critical areas of English literature to appraise it differently, to understand

31:03.330 --> 31:12.870
that unlike other kinds of literature, science fiction has special things that it does and

31:12.870 --> 31:22.350
has special ways that it does it and to appraise science fiction by the same kind of standards

31:22.410 --> 31:29.610
that you apply to traditional literature, science fiction is always going to come up short,

31:31.510 --> 31:39.410
it doesn't do the same things, it deals not with characters but with change and so it

31:39.410 --> 31:48.610
seems to me that there needs to be two different routes or there are two desirable ends for

31:48.610 --> 31:57.550
criticism, one is to educate the non-science fiction part of the literary world to the

31:57.550 --> 32:03.950
special requirements of science fiction and its special accomplishments, the other is

32:03.950 --> 32:14.330
to exercise and apply a set of standards to science fiction itself to improve the breed

32:14.330 --> 32:15.050
so to speak.

32:17.330 --> 32:22.270
Okay fine, I only have two more questions on this particular line that I've been following,

32:24.070 --> 32:28.930
your book alternate worlds, I didn't have a real specific question on that, I've used

32:28.930 --> 32:34.070
it as a research aid and found it very useful and of course I read Brian Aldous's and Donald

32:34.070 --> 32:38.330
Walheim's and so forth, histories of science fiction, do you think there's room for any

32:38.330 --> 32:39.630
more histories of science fiction?

32:40.530 --> 32:47.890
Well they're still coming up and whether they're any more needed, I suspect that as

32:47.890 --> 32:58.550
these books get dated new appraisals are necessary and indeed if a new kind of perception of

32:58.550 --> 33:06.650
science fiction emerges there certainly needs to be a reappraisal of the history that is

33:07.610 --> 33:15.050
either supported or refuted. I don't know that we really need more histories, I suspect

33:17.590 --> 33:24.470
that maybe in another ten or fifteen years maybe a new history will be more needed.

33:27.050 --> 33:32.140
Fine, okay my other question, this is one we ask all the authors that we talk to and

33:32.140 --> 33:38.040
sort of a touchy subject with them, it has to do with the relation between science fiction

33:38.040 --> 33:43.180
and mainstream, I've read some of your ideas on it and I can't quite make up my mind, I

33:43.180 --> 33:48.880
think in one essay I think it was the one that appeared in Bretoners book, you said

33:48.880 --> 33:53.980
that science fiction and the mainstream were becoming closer but that you thought that

33:53.980 --> 33:58.660
perhaps it would be a good idea for science fiction to keep its unique qualities. Whereas

33:58.660 --> 34:03.840
in another piece I think it was the introduction to breaking point, you said that it implied

34:03.840 --> 34:08.200
that it was a good idea that they do come back together where they belong and that they

34:08.200 --> 34:12.820
should blend. I wondered if you could sort of specify your feelings about that.

34:15.080 --> 34:28.640
Well I guess maybe I do have mixed notions about it. I think that existing separate concepts

34:28.660 --> 34:37.480
deliberately science fiction has attained certain kinds of kind of strengths created

34:37.480 --> 34:50.700
by isolation but also certain kinds of weaknesses. But I also think that the mainstream of literature

34:50.700 --> 34:59.580
has certain qualities and selection processes that could benefit science fiction.

35:00.800 --> 35:07.540
I guess the ideal, and I think in a certain sense it is happening, the ideal would be

35:07.540 --> 35:19.440
that good books ought to be published without, essentially without generic identification.

35:20.680 --> 35:28.880
And they are being so published. I think if you look around at the significant new novels

35:28.880 --> 35:43.760
that are really selling well, like the Dune books or like Gregory Benford's newest novel,

35:44.240 --> 35:54.560
Timescape, they aren't really published generically. They are being published as novels which can

35:54.560 --> 36:01.960
find their own readers. And as a consequence, the latest, I guess God Emperor of Dune sold

36:02.940 --> 36:08.680
something like 200,000 copies in hard cover which makes it a best selling. It certainly

36:08.680 --> 36:18.360
would not have that kind of sales as a science fiction book. And it is not being published

36:18.360 --> 36:31.480
that way. At the same time, I would say that I would hate to see the genre itself be totally

36:32.040 --> 36:38.680
merged into the mainstream so that it couldn't be identified because I think it has certain

36:38.680 --> 36:49.980
kinds of strengths that might well be lost. And if every book was unable to seek a particular

36:49.980 --> 36:55.620
kind of audience that could identify it, there would be much less science fiction written

36:56.550 --> 37:02.680
and much less written. So I'd like to see both things happen simultaneously. I think

37:02.680 --> 37:11.860
they are happening. It also has some drawbacks to it too currently in that if science fiction

37:11.860 --> 37:22.240
has the capacity to sell as best sellers, then editors and publishers are going to be looking

37:22.240 --> 37:27.760
at all books that are submitted to them, all science fiction books, to see if they have

37:27.760 --> 37:36.560
the best seller in them. And many, I think mid-range books which at once would have been

37:36.560 --> 37:47.960
published without question are now being rejected because they do not really have the potential

37:47.960 --> 37:50.120
to be as rewarding as some of the others.

37:53.240 --> 37:59.000
Okay. If you're still doing okay, I think I better move on to some of your own work.

37:59.240 --> 38:04.520
I did have some more ideas about the criticism and so forth, but I better be selective here

38:04.520 --> 38:13.500
because I did want to talk about your own work too. The joy makers. I guess it's hedonics.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.840
That's how you pronounce it?

38:14.900 --> 38:16.080
That's how I pronounce it.

38:17.700 --> 38:25.280
If I remember, their premise was that the basic freedom is the freedom to be happy. Okay,

38:25.380 --> 38:29.460
now obviously I read the book and I know the answer to this, but could you just briefly

38:29.460 --> 38:32.660
tell me where the flaw is in that reasoning?

38:33.620 --> 38:42.200
Well, my, and I really worked my way through it having gotten the idea for a basic science

38:42.200 --> 38:48.200
of happiness from an article I read in the Psychotherapy of Britannica and sort of worked

38:48.200 --> 38:58.740
my way through the notion that happiness, you know, could be achieved scientifically

38:59.480 --> 39:06.460
directly rather than through things that we think might make us happy like love or fame

39:06.460 --> 39:15.300
or money or success or whatever we think, you know, might make us happy. And essentially,

39:16.440 --> 39:22.720
this article that I read pointed out to me something that I don't know whether I would

39:22.720 --> 39:28.040
have thought about or not. Maybe I would have, that there are basically two ways to

39:28.040 --> 39:36.360
be happy. You can either get what you want, which will make you happy, or you can want

39:36.360 --> 39:42.160
what you get. And that means that you have to discipline yourself so that no matter what

39:42.160 --> 39:51.160
happens, you're happy because you are the kind of disciplined person who doesn't let

39:51.160 --> 39:55.300
his happiness depend upon external events. And that of course is a kind of stoicism.

39:57.000 --> 40:06.340
And I saw this as being the two holes upon which I could rest a philosophic approach.

40:06.660 --> 40:15.340
To the notion of happiness. Ultimately, as it worked out in the novel, it turned out

40:15.340 --> 40:25.840
that the people who wanted happiness to get what they want, since the, what one can get

40:25.840 --> 40:30.720
in the external world is limited by the number of people and the number of people who want

40:30.720 --> 40:39.600
this particular thing. Ultimately, they get what they want by being fed illusions that

40:39.600 --> 40:46.420
they get what they want. And ultimately, everybody ends up floating in amniotic cells living

40:46.420 --> 40:55.560
on dreams of success and accomplishment fed by a machine, which I eventually worked out

40:55.560 --> 41:02.640
to be that you're happy when you don't want anything anymore. And it occurred to me that

41:02.640 --> 41:09.180
that is the same as death. And ultimately, the equation for that is that happiness equals

41:09.180 --> 41:14.340
death and that life is still wanting something.

41:17.680 --> 41:24.900
Okay, as I was nearing the end of that book and saw what you were getting at, I got the

41:24.900 --> 41:29.360
impression that you were saying man was not meant or he was not created to be satisfied.

41:29.540 --> 41:32.040
His nature is not such. And I wondered if you...

41:32.040 --> 41:37.000
Yeah, well, my third dirty, my feeling about it comes in a sense from a story about Candide,

41:37.200 --> 41:46.960
which I read many years ago that Candide was walking along a country road and saw a woman,

41:47.520 --> 41:52.300
or I don't mean Candide, I mean Voltaire, the author of Candide. Voltaire was walking

41:52.300 --> 41:58.040
along this country road and saw a peasant woman working in the fields, singing happily

41:58.040 --> 42:05.460
while he was walking along, overcome with the cares of states and the problems of intellectual

42:06.640 --> 42:14.680
difficulties. And he said to himself, wouldn't it be wonderful if I could change places with

42:14.680 --> 42:20.640
her and she could have all of my knowledge and misery and I could have all of her ignorance

42:20.640 --> 42:27.580
and happiness. And he responded, no. He said, I wouldn't trade that for an instant. He said,

42:27.900 --> 42:33.380
if the choice is happiness versus knowledge, he said, I'll choose knowledge every time.

42:34.020 --> 42:40.500
And it seems to me that people only think they want to be happy. That they really, what

42:40.500 --> 42:45.640
they really want is knowledge, not just abstract knowledge. They want knowledge and they will

42:45.640 --> 42:52.860
pursue knowledge even when it makes them unhappy. And I have incorporated this in a number of

42:52.860 --> 42:57.720
books. Campus, for instance, has the same kind of theme.

43:00.380 --> 43:05.300
I also got the impression, though maybe I was wrong here, in the work Faust. I think

43:05.300 --> 43:10.000
that the bargain Faust makes with the devil is that if the devil can ever satisfy and

43:10.000 --> 43:15.720
make him totally happy, then he's lost and he goes to hell. You didn't have that in

43:15.720 --> 43:16.440
the background either?

43:17.520 --> 43:26.240
No, I don't think so. Of course, I know the Faust legend and the various literary works

43:26.240 --> 43:33.640
based on it, but I wasn't really thinking about it at that time. What I was really thinking

43:33.640 --> 43:41.460
about more than anything else was the fact that it was the Voltaire concept and the feeling

43:41.460 --> 43:50.480
that people, I guess, my own basic feeling that people only think they want to be happy.

43:52.440 --> 43:58.780
Okay, let me just move on briefly to the Immortals. Would I be right in presuming that

43:58.780 --> 44:00.120
to be your best known book?

44:00.660 --> 44:07.220
Well, probably because of the television series. It may be the best known, although

44:07.220 --> 44:12.860
certainly the listen is also very well known.

44:14.460 --> 44:16.480
What was your reaction to the TV series?

44:17.140 --> 44:23.560
Well, I thought it was a total disaster. And that's not uncommon, of course, but the

44:23.560 --> 44:32.200
resemblances between the novel and the book are very slight. My book starts with the Immortal

44:33.120 --> 44:40.440
being a drifter who comes in and sells a pint of blood and then disappears for the

44:40.440 --> 44:48.880
rest of the novel until the very end. And the television series is all about the Immortal

44:48.880 --> 44:55.460
and his being pursued. And eventually it turns into simply another search for the papers,
