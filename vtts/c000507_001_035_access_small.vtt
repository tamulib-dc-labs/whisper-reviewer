WEBVTT

00:01.340 --> 00:05.440
Even though I'm a little stuff stuff and so on, there's usually more trouble in turning

00:05.440 --> 00:06.200
the tape.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.260
Okay, we got the tape rolling.

00:09.780 --> 00:14.000
Could you first of all just say a little bit about your first exposure to science fiction

00:14.000 --> 00:14.880
back when you were a teenager?

00:15.440 --> 00:18.340
Oh way back, even pre-teenage.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.660
I'd say probably grammar school.

00:22.100 --> 00:25.420
I was a very fast reader, very advanced reader.

00:26.300 --> 00:35.000
And I was reading both classical stuff and the stuff in the libraries, so on from third

00:35.000 --> 00:35.720
and fourth grade.

00:37.220 --> 00:44.520
I very much remember reading Wells and Burt and shocking teachers by turning in book

00:44.520 --> 00:46.120
reports on them in elementary school.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.760
Probably the most formative influence, which is sadly no longer around nor is there any

00:53.760 --> 00:54.180
equivalent.

00:54.960 --> 01:02.100
It was done by Winston, which was a series of science fiction books oriented towards

01:02.100 --> 01:10.100
teens, mostly written by Lechardel Ray, Don Wilheim and Evan Hunter under a lot of pseudonyms.

01:11.100 --> 01:15.720
And it was really a superior series and it really got you excited looking at more.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.280
Oh, okay, thank you.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.900
How did you get involved in the fan structure?

01:26.480 --> 01:30.000
Actually, I saw a letter in a science fiction magazine.

01:30.480 --> 01:36.800
I was pretty poor as a kid, but we did have a drugstore across the street with a corner

01:36.800 --> 01:38.000
newsstand and so on.

01:38.600 --> 01:45.700
So in order to get away with as much as possible, you know, we'd go over there and I'd go to

01:45.700 --> 01:49.740
read some of the stuff out of the magazines at the drugstore newsstand.

01:51.080 --> 01:59.100
And since I was good friends with the pharmacist's son, he was more tolerant towards me.

01:59.800 --> 02:05.700
And I saw this letter and this guy was talking about he had an amateur magazine or a fan

02:05.700 --> 02:06.880
zine down in Alabama.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.340
And I thought that was great.

02:09.340 --> 02:22.560
So I wrote and suddenly discovered that I was part of an institution called Science Fiction

02:22.560 --> 02:29.940
Fandom that had been around since the 30s at least and was extremely large international

02:29.940 --> 02:30.460
in scope.

02:30.980 --> 02:35.940
And this would be about when I was 12 years old.

02:37.060 --> 02:39.840
And I've been sort of more or less involved in it ever since.

02:40.580 --> 02:44.820
It became pretty obvious to me after getting into it for a while that if I was going to

02:44.820 --> 02:51.320
afford it, I was going to have to do something to make money in it because they had conventions,

02:51.940 --> 02:53.720
various parts of the country which took money.

02:54.820 --> 02:59.840
And the best contact was by getting a mimeograph of your own and producing your own little

02:59.840 --> 03:00.340
magazine.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.200
And that takes money and I didn't have any of it.

03:04.900 --> 03:08.300
Is that how the, well how did you start the mirage then, the fan zine?

03:10.480 --> 03:17.360
Well, that basically was the reason we started with the fan zine which was run off actually

03:17.360 --> 03:20.240
at a school at the beginning because we didn't have anything else.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.260
And it got some reasonably good reactions.

03:25.660 --> 03:30.780
So I started building up from there while I was doing that actually.

03:30.780 --> 03:38.280
I had correspondence already with enormous numbers of people, both professional and fan.

03:39.200 --> 03:44.060
I had so much correspondence I can't believe how much, how many people I was contacting

03:44.750 --> 03:45.820
on a regular basis.

03:46.700 --> 03:55.920
And so I started tapping them and created the fan zine mirage in addition of a $40 surplus

03:55.920 --> 04:01.460
mimeograph found in an old store which I still own by the way and which still works.

04:03.380 --> 04:10.760
I was able to start putting out a fan zine called Mirage and for the next 10 years that

04:11.700 --> 04:17.100
was the sort of the bedrock of my contact with everybody else.

04:18.260 --> 04:23.360
And I discovered very quickly that you could make at least a little bit of money out of

04:23.360 --> 04:23.500
it.

04:25.020 --> 04:29.180
So that got the idea of why not doing side booklets.

04:31.500 --> 04:36.380
I was serious and constructive at the same time that everybody else was being just sort

04:36.380 --> 04:37.940
of kid hobbyist.

04:38.600 --> 04:45.100
I really had a magazine that discussed the literature, discussed the writers and so on

04:45.100 --> 04:45.900
fast and present.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.780
And at a time when very few of these were coming out.

04:48.780 --> 04:54.680
And so I attracted a rather large audience of collectors and professional writers and

04:54.680 --> 04:55.580
artists and so on.

04:56.300 --> 05:03.880
And I was able to create out of that the Mirage press which started off again as mimeographed

05:04.780 --> 05:12.860
publications and then later grew as capital grew into a hardcover and paperback and quality

05:12.860 --> 05:13.640
paperback publishing.

05:15.760 --> 05:21.040
And if I understand it those books are mostly nonfiction studies of bibliographies and authors

05:21.040 --> 05:21.640
and so forth?

05:21.840 --> 05:22.960
You can't compete with double day.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.160
I mean let's face it.

05:25.740 --> 05:30.300
You can't compete with double day, so I'm going to choose to turn so on for the good

05:30.300 --> 05:31.840
stuff in fiction.

05:32.700 --> 05:41.480
And although I did do a little bit of fiction, getting into prints and books of work that

05:41.480 --> 05:46.380
I thought was very very neglected, you really have to promote fiction.

05:47.680 --> 05:53.800
Whereas nonfiction and reference material is always, there's always a heavy market and

05:53.800 --> 05:55.260
there's been a growing market for it.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.960
And so I concentrated in that end.

05:58.840 --> 06:04.080
And we came up with some rather successful books, Guide to Middle Earth, which in its

06:04.080 --> 06:09.480
Valentine form, which I still own a piece of, is still selling well in Atlas of Fantasy.

06:12.720 --> 06:17.800
We did three books on sword and sorcery fiction before the comic books discovered Conan.

06:20.400 --> 06:29.320
We did essays, we did critical studies, Jack Williamson for example on H.G. Well, that

06:29.320 --> 06:29.880
kind of thing.

06:30.860 --> 06:38.220
And occasionally we did rather odd materials such as a collection of all of the Ferdinand

06:39.400 --> 06:44.120
fecute, bad puns that have been published over the years, this kind of thing.

06:45.380 --> 06:50.060
Mostly though we were serious reference works and we still have a number of them that are

06:50.060 --> 06:50.360
standard.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.280
Now how did you publish those books?

06:53.440 --> 06:57.060
What did you design them and got the material and so forth and sent them to a job or some

06:57.060 --> 06:59.120
kind of guy, I don't know, a publisher?

06:59.840 --> 07:00.880
Well no, I was the publisher.

07:01.820 --> 07:07.600
As I say, I started off with a bibliography of H.P. Lovecraft, which I did myself.

07:08.420 --> 07:16.520
Put it together, mimeographed it with the help of August Arilith, who owned the rights

07:16.520 --> 07:30.240
to the H.P. Lovecraft material at the time and sold it for what in 1960 was the horrendous

07:30.840 --> 07:34.800
fee of a one dollar and we sold a hundred of them.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.320
And I was floored to cost me about forty dollars to produce it.

07:40.600 --> 07:46.820
And then the late David H. Keller, who was an old time science fiction and fantasy writer,

07:47.720 --> 07:53.960
said, I have this one novel that's never been published, would you be interested in it?

07:54.060 --> 08:00.880
So I did a edition of that also in the mimeograph, illustrated in signed edition though.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.620
We did only a hundred and seventy-five of them.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.160
We sold it to two dollars and it went.

08:06.160 --> 08:16.720
And we did five or six mimeographed items and had an increasing complexity in size and

08:17.560 --> 08:19.300
they succeeded extremely well.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.920
The only thing that stopped me from going further right at the beginning was of course

08:24.920 --> 08:25.620
I didn't have any money.

08:28.100 --> 08:33.300
And therefore it became a scramble to find various partners and so on who had money.

08:35.280 --> 08:42.680
And once I got capital from them, I was able to get projects that were floating around,

08:43.400 --> 08:45.520
good ideas, sometimes I originated the idea.

08:46.500 --> 08:55.260
In the case of Guide to Middle Earth, it was simply a case of seeing this enormous concordance

08:55.260 --> 09:01.520
to JRW Tolkien published in multiple parts in a fanzine with a circulation of a few hundred

09:02.140 --> 09:06.060
and saying, you know, that would make a really successful book, Tolkien's About the Hit.

09:08.660 --> 09:12.660
And so I wrote him and I suggested that we do the book.

09:13.800 --> 09:18.760
Once we had some capital, we had a typesetter and other stuff.

09:18.760 --> 09:25.720
So we designed the book and typeset the book, got the cover, put everything together and

09:25.720 --> 09:33.060
then we went to Ann Arbor, Michigan to have it printed and found because that's the short

09:33.060 --> 09:34.500
run book capital of the nation.

09:35.060 --> 09:36.580
It was wall to wall.

09:37.140 --> 09:40.460
Book publishers, they're all specializing in smaller runs.

09:42.900 --> 09:48.700
And we used our contacts with people, with other publishers who had been doing special

09:48.700 --> 09:49.800
publishing for years.

09:50.340 --> 09:56.700
And we went out there and made a good deal, established our credit and we had a string

09:56.700 --> 09:58.100
of very large successes.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.100
Okay, good. Let me go ahead and ask you when and why you decided to become a writer.

10:05.060 --> 10:13.060
Yeah, that's a little more complicated. I started, I'd always known I was going to be

10:13.060 --> 10:15.800
a writer. I mean, there just was never any question in my mind.

10:16.260 --> 10:19.400
But it was just sort of something that you never really sat down and did.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.840
I used to play around with stories here and there.

10:23.060 --> 10:30.540
John Campbell was a big help. During the 60s, I would float ideas and fragments off him

10:30.540 --> 10:34.280
and he would be very, very nice and tell me exactly what was wrong.

10:34.600 --> 10:40.320
Of course, what I've created everybody about John Campbell was that the man had been editing

10:40.320 --> 10:45.140
for 40 years and he could put his finger on something and tell you exactly what you were

10:45.140 --> 10:45.760
doing wrong.

10:46.260 --> 10:50.440
And it was terribly infuriating to discover that he was right in almost every case.

10:51.580 --> 10:54.780
He saw why he did it from 39 until he died.

10:56.680 --> 11:03.340
And as a result of being able to have the help of people like Campbell and August Arilith

11:03.340 --> 11:10.040
and a lot of really established writers and editors in the field, I was able to get a good

11:10.040 --> 11:14.080
recognition of exactly what was required in the field.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.820
It just was a matter of sitting down and doing it.

11:18.500 --> 11:27.760
And what provided the kick was that in 1975, I had all sorts of things go wrong at the

11:27.760 --> 11:28.400
same time.

11:29.940 --> 11:36.460
I was having job problems I was teaching and there was sort of a constant war there.

11:37.940 --> 11:46.880
I had just had a romance break up and my partner in extreme source of capital in Maraj

11:46.880 --> 11:55.240
Press had had a mental breakdown at the institutionalized which left me without capital and with a lot

11:55.240 --> 11:55.620
of debts.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.680
And everything just looked downhill.

11:59.180 --> 12:05.580
On top of that, I had to have a operation on the roof of my mouth that had not been

12:05.580 --> 12:06.140
successful.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.140
The infection that was there would have killed me.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.380
And so I'm thinking, oh my God, I could be dead.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.200
So if I'm going to write it all, I better do it.

12:16.920 --> 12:24.840
So I sat on a typewriter and there was really no question in my mind as to what I'd do

12:24.840 --> 12:25.360
first.

12:27.100 --> 12:30.820
I had been playing around with an idea for years and years and years.

12:31.500 --> 12:39.080
There was even a short fancy version of it, 20 years old, called Jungle or Jungle of Stars.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.200
There were a lot of code words for Jungle was always in it.

12:44.220 --> 12:48.020
And I sat down and wrote the things.

12:48.540 --> 12:55.260
I had been around so long in my mind and discussions and so on that there was just no problems,

12:55.880 --> 12:59.740
no resistance, no having to think it out or anything else.

13:00.620 --> 13:03.760
And I wrote it solidly in about two and a half, three weeks.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.120
And then sent it off.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.520
And it's a good old fashioned type.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.440
It's a science fiction murder mystery.

13:17.760 --> 13:21.580
Very much at home in the old founding analog.

13:22.300 --> 13:26.580
So on even though that's some modern touches to it.

13:27.040 --> 13:37.320
And Judy Lindell Ray, who had just become editor of Valentine, which was soon to have

13:37.320 --> 13:42.700
a science fiction line named after her, took a look at it.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.200
We'd known each other for about 15 years.

13:46.180 --> 13:51.560
And she put off reading it for quite a long time because she was afraid that if it was

13:51.560 --> 13:55.800
terrible and she said so that she'd blow our friendship or something.

13:56.440 --> 14:02.420
Finally she said, we got together at a convention and she admitted to me all this.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.280
She said, okay, I'll read it, but be prepared.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.940
And about four days later I get a phone call and she said, hey, this is great.

14:09.040 --> 14:09.780
I want to buy it.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.700
And that was the first sale.

14:15.820 --> 14:20.460
The money there paid off a lot of medical bills and so on.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.280
And also since I had sold it, it made me feel a little better, a little more confident.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.880
Oddly enough, I didn't really immediately turn around and start writing anything else.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.120
I tried to take care of a whole lot of stuff.

14:34.740 --> 14:39.980
And it wasn't until the next summer that I was actually able to sit down and think,

14:40.480 --> 14:41.860
see what do I want to do next.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.760
Okay, yeah, that's good.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.040
I want to talk just a little bit about the well.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.680
We don't have time to talk about all your books.

14:51.820 --> 14:55.120
I read them, but I wanted to specify or focus on a couple things.

14:55.540 --> 14:58.560
One thing that fascinates me about all your books is your dedications.

14:59.700 --> 15:02.500
I learned just as much from reading those, I think, as I do reading the books.

15:03.160 --> 15:07.340
And one of the things that fascinated me in particular was the, I think it was a dedication

15:07.340 --> 15:11.340
to Twilight, the Well of Souls, where you talked about the origin of the well world idea

15:11.340 --> 15:12.960
at this National Park in Washington.

15:13.440 --> 15:13.740
That's right.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.000
Could you expand on that?

15:15.360 --> 15:18.520
Okay, well that just sort of leads into where I was, where I just broke off.

15:19.440 --> 15:23.660
I've had a habit of, every year since I have been employed and been making money

15:23.660 --> 15:29.680
and been reasonably successful, to turn and go someplace every year in the summertime

15:29.680 --> 15:30.680
that I haven't been before.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.400
I sometimes go back to play favorite places as well, but I always like to put at least one place in.

15:36.940 --> 15:42.940
And in 1974, I'd gone up to Alaska and trooped around the state for four to six weeks.

15:44.320 --> 15:48.580
And I had to go through Washington State to get there, of course.

15:49.380 --> 15:54.220
And I looked around and I said, gee, this is real pretty, but I've never really had time to stay

15:54.220 --> 15:55.080
in the state of Washington.

15:55.180 --> 16:02.020
So I made it a point that the next time I could, I was going to come back and just spend time

16:02.020 --> 16:04.060
doing nothing but exploring Washington State.

16:04.620 --> 16:06.340
And in 1976, I did.

16:07.560 --> 16:13.760
I went up there and just rented a car and my general technique is to point it in any direction

16:13.760 --> 16:18.400
and just simply cover the area, get lost, and then get unlawful again,

16:18.860 --> 16:20.700
poke into everything that can be done.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.760
Lots of national parks.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.460
I was a big fan of a national park system.

16:26.500 --> 16:32.620
And I am also delighted with the state of Washington because I have a passion for the

16:32.620 --> 16:36.160
channels of ferry boats and a state with 22 ferry boats.

16:37.680 --> 16:45.060
And I had gone actually into the middle of the state mostly to take a ferry boat across Lake Roosevelt.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.480
And I'm looking at the map after taking the ferry across.

16:50.740 --> 16:56.620
And I see this long lake that I've never really heard of before called Lake Chalant.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.020
And so I went up to it.

17:01.200 --> 17:05.820
I originally thought it was a damned lake, but it turned out to be not an artificial thing at all.

17:05.940 --> 17:14.580
It turned out to be a 55-mile long, one-mile wide glacial lake, natural lake with a big powerhouse.

17:14.580 --> 17:19.440
They put a turbine on it at the end and a town supporting it, Chalant.

17:20.500 --> 17:25.340
And I saw that there was a passenger ferry that went up, no roads.

17:27.640 --> 17:32.740
So the next day I caught the ferry, the lady of the lake, which is a mail boat,

17:33.000 --> 17:37.120
drops people off, run ladders up a surpliff, gets people off and on,

17:37.120 --> 17:44.260
and finally winds up 55 miles up Lake in the village of Taheacon.

17:45.220 --> 17:50.120
Taheacon is an old logging town.

17:50.380 --> 17:54.800
They used to cut logs up there and dump them in the lake and they'd float down to Chalant.

17:55.580 --> 17:59.640
It's now the National Park Service headquarters for the National Recreation Area there

17:59.640 --> 18:03.140
and North Cascades National Park in a small lodge.

18:04.260 --> 18:11.260
So I was able to get a room there and I discovered that when that boat turns around at 12.45 in the afternoon,

18:11.280 --> 18:12.820
there is no way out.

18:14.480 --> 18:20.440
You are at the most isolated. I think I had already been all over Alaska and this was the most isolated I ever felt.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.580
You're surrounded by sheer mountains on three sides, the lake on the fourth.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.420
You can turn on a radio and you just can't get anything.

18:32.400 --> 18:36.440
There's combination of mountains and geography and so on, just block it all out.

18:37.220 --> 18:43.820
It's just totally isolated. There's no roads. There's no telephone or telegraph wires or anything.

18:45.900 --> 18:50.760
And I got to sitting by the lake that night and talking with some people.

18:51.740 --> 19:01.620
And I got the idea for this large world built by a long dead race and so on.

19:01.700 --> 19:09.940
I didn't really have much of an idea of what it was and they do have a service out of Stahika that will take you up to Trailhead.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.500
And so I went up to Trailhead and I wound up walking down.

19:14.740 --> 19:17.780
I'm a great hiker as long as the direction is down.

19:19.680 --> 19:24.240
I'm afraid I've never been to the bottom of the Grand Canyon because I can get down there but I can't get back up.

19:24.960 --> 19:31.400
But here was a trail that Taylor made for me. It was down the Cascades all the way.

19:32.680 --> 19:39.840
So I took it and it took about 8 and a half hours to walk the whole distance.

19:42.400 --> 19:49.460
And during that time you go through 8 climate zones. You start off in the snow, you wind up in a rainforest.

19:50.880 --> 19:58.500
And some of the changes are rather abrupt. You just go around to switch back and it just changes from one climate to another.

19:58.560 --> 20:06.400
Each with its own different plants and insects and occasional mammals. Even the birds seem to be different.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.120
But yeah, this is how that big world would be like.

20:10.200 --> 20:14.660
So even though while I was on my way down I was kind of scribbling ideas.

20:16.640 --> 20:21.860
And I got the idea for this giant world composed of basically world-plates.

20:22.920 --> 20:30.280
Different abrupt geography, climate, landforms, you name it, each with its own dominant race.

20:33.140 --> 20:39.980
By the time I hit bottom my head had pretty well worked out although I didn't really know what the shape of the things were going to be.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.320
I wish I could take credit for just going to a game board but it didn't occur to me until I had gotten back home.

20:46.760 --> 20:55.660
And I was discussing the idea with a science fiction fan named Ben Yellow, son of a Nobel winner, Rosalind Yellen.

20:55.660 --> 20:59.720
And he said, why don't you just use an Abilion Hill game board?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.060
And I thought, yeah, that would work.

21:03.700 --> 21:10.660
So we got out an Abilion Hill map, a war game map and a little trusty calculator.

21:11.400 --> 21:17.240
We laid a grid of these hexagons around a roughly earth-sized world.

21:17.880 --> 21:27.260
Of course you cannot cover a sphere with hexagons, so that means we had the north zone and the south zone, which would be the embassy's entry and exit point.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.840
That would cover our sphere.

21:30.960 --> 21:41.760
And then it was just simply a matter of sitting down, listing what was required to do, what kind of creatures and land, climate and so on.

21:41.760 --> 21:53.240
And I would have to do for the route of the story, dropping by Abilion Hill, which I lived very near at the time, picking up some blank maps and just working it out from there.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.840
How many books did you entand when you started?

21:57.820 --> 21:58.020
One.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.000
Midnight stands alone.

22:01.200 --> 22:11.240
As a matter of fact, if I had thought that I was going to write any more in the series, I would have done a few things differently in midnight because no end of problem is later.

22:11.240 --> 22:19.420
Because it was very nice when you were just, you know, if you needed an impassable hex for a particular plot problem, you just simply stuck one there.

22:19.820 --> 22:25.320
And if you needed one with a different level of technology, you simply stuck it there for plot purposes.

22:25.980 --> 22:38.760
But when you had to expand the map and when you had to make it a much wider, more panoramic type of thing, I discovered that some of the early sins that I had committed for expediency in midnight

22:38.760 --> 22:51.700
caused me no end of map problems when I went from, say, six or eight hexes going this way to thousands or even hundreds going out from it.

22:54.040 --> 22:58.200
The thing is that midnight was the book that made me.

22:59.620 --> 23:03.560
I took it, I was proofreading it at the World Science Fiction Convention in 1976.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.460
And Judy Lindell Ray came up and said, when are you going to do your next book?

23:07.580 --> 23:11.660
And I just couldn't resist it. It wasn't completely proofread or anything yet.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.340
I just picked it up in the hands of a tour and said, here.

23:17.140 --> 23:24.060
And she took it home and four days after I got home, I got a call from her saying it's terrific.

23:24.280 --> 23:28.240
It's better than the first real writer, you know, the whole flattery bet.

23:29.520 --> 23:39.460
And she bought that and then she proceeded to schedule it in what was not a very nice play.

23:40.560 --> 23:47.820
Basically, it was the non-leader. The leader book, of course, is the one that gets all the money and all the promotion for any given month.

23:48.500 --> 23:52.780
It was not a leader because that's usually determined by how much money is paid.

23:54.660 --> 24:00.480
It was brought out in July, which is one of the worst book-buying months of the year.

24:01.700 --> 24:06.360
People are on vacation, colleges are out, you name it, you know.

24:08.080 --> 24:15.680
And with no fanfare, it never did get one major review in the science fiction media at all.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.400
And so it was just sort of dropped there.

24:20.260 --> 24:28.680
But something caught, and I wish I knew exactly what was done accidentally so that I could do it again on purpose.

24:30.120 --> 24:37.800
Because particularly when the college had started opening up again in September, the sales of the thing just sort of started going through the roof.

24:38.920 --> 24:47.300
And I discovered when I tried to get a couple of extra copies for people, in early October I called up Valentine and they said,

24:47.360 --> 24:52.940
I'm sorry, it's out of print. I said, what do you mean it's out of print? What did you do? Print 25,000?

24:53.260 --> 24:57.860
No, they hadn't. They'd done a full major print run and they'd sold out of it.

24:57.960 --> 25:06.960
It turned out that for reasons that even they were shocked at, and nobody's been able to quite figure out yet how the word got around,

25:07.640 --> 25:12.700
the book became the biggest selling non-media title they had.

25:12.860 --> 25:15.280
I mean, they did have Star Wars, you know.

25:17.260 --> 25:24.620
But beyond that, beyond the media stuff, I was the biggest seller of the year.

25:25.800 --> 25:37.200
And that's, you know, one of the ways to get big fast and get your career cemented is to come in from the movies or be some kind of personality or something

25:37.200 --> 25:39.860
and come in and get promoted right from the beginning.

25:40.520 --> 25:45.940
Or have a movie made of your first book so that your second book gets really big, just, you know, West Even King did a second thing.

25:46.540 --> 26:00.120
A way that gets equal attention and respect is a book that is literally dropped in as just a make-do book, a book that never is expected to go anywhere.

26:00.460 --> 26:05.040
They don't put any money into it. They don't put any promotion. They hardly even send out review copies.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.160
The thing becomes a big hit anyway. That impresses me.

26:09.220 --> 26:11.600
And so it was really midnight that made my career.

26:12.620 --> 26:14.080
Yeah, that's interesting. Okay.

26:16.220 --> 26:22.680
Where in the whole scheme of the books, the whole five novel set, where did the Markovians go wrong?

26:23.980 --> 26:32.560
Oh, well. I have this one problem with them, with discussing specific things.

26:32.800 --> 26:40.640
And that is the fact that really the question of where the Markovians went wrong, that was the after-race, of course, that's dope to think.

26:42.320 --> 26:46.380
It's something that's really speculated on, but you never really know.

26:47.100 --> 26:55.000
I like to give the reader some kind of feeling. I like to let sort of the books speak for themselves on those problems.

26:55.520 --> 27:06.140
I keep running into all sorts of things as to whether or not Nathan Brazile, who is the hero of Three Out of the Five, is, is or is not God.

27:06.140 --> 27:14.060
And he alternately claims to be and alternately shoots himself down, but he lies a lot.

27:15.560 --> 27:21.120
So nobody's really quite sure. He gives several different things and it's left up to the reader to decide.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.820
I think some of those questions are best left undecided.

27:27.200 --> 27:31.280
Of course, the Markovians, the foundation of the Markovians thing is the same.

27:31.280 --> 27:37.000
I use this thing in a number of other books. Is that utopia is unremittingly boring.

27:39.680 --> 27:47.240
That there is no such thing as a perfect society. And that the thing that we do is we strive to create a perfect society.

27:48.040 --> 27:55.000
And that, that is a good thing. And that produces, in many cases, a lot of good results.

27:55.000 --> 28:03.320
But if we, if we ever attained this thing, I mean, we'd be nothing but human beings.

28:03.660 --> 28:12.960
As far as happiness is concerned, I mean, we can give everybody an lobotomy and they'll run around being very happy.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.820
But they're not human anymore, I don't think.

28:19.480 --> 28:29.000
In order to keep our creative spark or outward urges, our excitement and everything else, there can be no such thing as perfection attained.

28:30.280 --> 28:37.720
And this is exactly what the Markovians tried for. They tried for perfection attained and they attained it.

28:38.520 --> 28:47.760
They got to the point where they were gone, literally, where their devices could conjure up anything they wanted, just with a mere thought of it.

28:49.920 --> 28:59.020
I since had it pointed out to me that they're sort of like the, the Krell in the old movie Forbidden Planet, in that they reached this Godhead status.

28:59.020 --> 29:05.300
But the Krell experiment failed because they couldn't control their, their passions.

29:05.960 --> 29:11.440
And the Markovian experiments exceeded and they literally became gods, then they became miserable.

29:12.280 --> 29:23.480
There was nothing left to attain, nothing left to know, nothing left, you know, you had a bunch of, a bunch of preachers that spent millions of years rising to this point.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.340
And they sit around and they say, this one there is.

29:29.180 --> 29:48.480
So, the idea of the great experiment came about was to redo it, to literally start the Markovians over from scratch with different kinds of creatures, different environments, with no real value system.

29:48.480 --> 29:52.060
I mean, they have to develop their own unique value systems. They do.

29:53.160 --> 29:59.400
And as a result, they're, they're grown and they're tested on this laboratory world, the well world.

29:59.820 --> 30:10.760
And then they were the ones that worked, the ones that showed promise of survival were then set into motion out throughout the universe, including men.

30:13.340 --> 30:25.840
And they had the hopes that eventually one of these races would reach a state of perfection that would not be empty or hollow.

30:26.780 --> 30:32.840
Now, I personally believe that, that when you reach that state, it is empty and hollow.

30:33.740 --> 30:41.980
But that's just my feeling other people might certainly do think differently.

30:43.320 --> 30:48.760
Okay, that's exactly the way I read it. And that was, that was what I would have said myself if I were asked on it.

30:49.560 --> 30:54.000
The, the incredible variety of, of alien types you have in well world.

30:54.640 --> 31:01.320
I'm always interested in how a science fiction author thinks up his aliens. Do you have any special ways that you go about that?

31:01.320 --> 31:02.200
No, I've created.

31:02.660 --> 31:15.360
Particularly, I used a variety of things. In some cases, a good pictorial natural history text will give you more weird creatures than you've ever seen, which can be modified.

31:17.140 --> 31:25.540
Some came out of mythology. Some came more or less direct out of Fantasia, sorts of like that.

31:26.300 --> 31:37.400
And a few came out of comic book concepts and, you know, just, you just brought them in from all over and you used basic shapes and basic types.

31:38.020 --> 31:44.780
And then you adjust them to what would happen if these were real, convenient, intelligent creatures.

31:44.780 --> 31:54.000
You know, creatures. I found very, very little trouble in coming up with an enormous variety of them.

31:54.680 --> 32:00.520
I'm not sure whether I could come up with 1,560, which is the number I would have to to visit every hex in the well world.

32:01.260 --> 32:04.040
But I've had no trouble coming up with the 200 or 300 so far.

32:05.520 --> 32:12.800
Okay, the, in regard to the well world and not, not only the well world, but even in the, say, the web of the chosen and jungle of stars,

32:12.800 --> 32:18.060
I've noticed almost a chock or motif, I'd call it, of transformation.

32:18.660 --> 32:25.360
You know, where humans are transformed or creatures are transformed. Is that, is that just coincidental or do you, do you have...

32:25.360 --> 32:33.540
In some books it's coincidental, in some books it's not. In some books it's even cynical in the sense that it's a fun thing to do.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.460
It's a fun thing to deal with.

32:37.900 --> 32:49.860
We have, for example, in the well world basically a, a wizard of Oz motif, you know, where you're able to, you're taken out of this very unpleasant society

32:49.860 --> 32:54.500
and you're suddenly given a new chance in this new and colorful world as something else.

32:54.660 --> 33:03.720
And of course the appeal of it, I realized later to the reader is that they can imagine themselves as almost anything in that setting.

33:05.660 --> 33:15.400
In terms of transformation generally, it is, it is a fun type thing to deal with.

33:15.480 --> 33:22.420
It is something where you can make statements, for example, you know, which is more important, form or substance.

33:24.560 --> 33:30.440
You can delve into some pretty deep things with it, but at the same time it has a great deal of variety.

33:32.520 --> 33:39.300
As I said, great many things that you can do with it and it seems to strike a chord in a lot of other people.

33:39.520 --> 33:43.500
So I use it a fair amount. I don't use it exclusively.

33:44.920 --> 33:53.180
I've written a World War II novel, I've written a futuristic political thriller where nobody gets changed at anything.

33:55.260 --> 34:00.660
And there are even some science fiction novels in line where really nobody gets transformed.

34:01.320 --> 34:11.500
I think people start looking. I think I can examine almost any outer space motif and give you something where people can say, hey, they changed from this to this.

34:12.040 --> 34:15.520
In the case of Jungle, nobody really changes, I mean, which you've got a parasite.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.340
There's no real transformation there.

34:22.060 --> 34:30.340
That's an old tried and true thing where you've got the parasitic creature in happening, whose body you don't know.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.940
And I don't consider that a transformation book at all.

34:39.600 --> 34:49.320
In case of Webber that chose, and that was my least favorite book of the ones that I have done, there are several reasons for that.

34:49.320 --> 34:55.560
One of which is that most people do not see it as the burlesque it was intended.

34:58.180 --> 35:05.340
Number two, after all the hullabaloo over midnight, they didn't review midnight at all, but everybody reviewed Webber the Chose.

35:06.140 --> 35:16.760
And everybody looked at Webber the Chose, all the big shot reviewers, and not a single one of them saw anything odd or unusual or even funny

35:16.760 --> 35:21.300
about creatures who take over worlds by crapping on their lawns.

35:23.520 --> 35:31.100
And instead they reviewed this as a serious sober political novel and so on, and totally missed the point,

35:31.240 --> 35:37.560
and they decided that I was just an incompetent hack because I, you know, they've done this with midnight.

35:38.580 --> 35:41.860
I could have taken the comparison to a lot of other novels.

35:41.860 --> 35:45.660
They've done it with a number of my serious books, but they didn't. They did it with this one.

35:48.040 --> 35:57.820
And I was very, very disappointed to discover that most people didn't realize that Webber the Chose was a burlesque of science fiction clichés,

35:58.860 --> 36:04.900
including me, including my own, but basically 40s and 50s clichés.

36:07.360 --> 36:14.700
And it's apparently very few people who really understood that until I point out how absurd some of the premises are in an old book.

36:14.860 --> 36:16.260
Oh yeah, gee, that's funny.

36:18.060 --> 36:24.840
You know, I started with the idea of an alien mastermind sitting in orbit trying to remember the pot of the B picture to take over the world right.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.480
And going on from there.

36:29.500 --> 36:33.700
I mean, I don't write one kind of book. I write lots of different kinds of books.

36:33.960 --> 36:40.720
I write bitterly satirical books. I write funny, turical books. And I write serious novels.

36:43.100 --> 36:54.160
And I like to let the novels speak for themselves, but I'm discovering that much of my audience has no sense of humor in what I hit them with a pie in the face on page 150.

36:55.760 --> 37:12.160
I think most people, I had the opposite problem with a book called In The Devil Will Drag You Under, where it was very clear, very close to the start, that this was going to be a funny book, a lipstick sort of book.

37:14.020 --> 37:19.440
And there are some very serious things addressed in The Devil Will Drag You Under.

37:19.440 --> 37:30.360
And there are some very serious scenes in it. And I've never seen anyone notice these, because they're so having so much fun back with Burlesque.

37:32.100 --> 37:34.360
But, you know, what can you do?

37:34.840 --> 37:40.740
Well, you mentioned another book too a few moments ago. You mentioned a serious political thrill. I assume that's War of Shadows.

37:41.520 --> 37:41.920
Yeah, War of Shadows.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.320
Futuristic thrill, you said. I'm sorry.

37:43.320 --> 37:51.760
Yeah, which is the only, War of Shadows is the only books of mine that's likely to become a movie at some point.

37:52.020 --> 37:58.080
That's what I wondered about. I wondered how it sold, and it seemed to me to be an obvious kind of a movie book. What are the possibilities?

37:58.400 --> 38:09.500
Well, terribly, because it was badly mis-marketed. It was sold as a far out science fiction thing. It was sold as a sort of a paperback version of an analog.

38:10.860 --> 38:17.380
It was badly packaged, badly distributed, badly promoted, and it didn't sell all that well, but it did sell as a movie.

38:18.980 --> 38:21.260
That would make an excellent movie. I hope somebody picks it up.

38:21.400 --> 38:28.880
Well, somebody picked it up. I mean, I'm getting paid every year on rights for it, and he's still talking about doing it, and they've got a script now.

38:30.960 --> 38:35.280
But a lot of things get optioned to movies, so we'll wait and see.

38:35.280 --> 38:39.540
I could have optioned a couple of other things, but I didn't like the deals.

38:39.720 --> 38:49.840
For example, Film Nation wanted to buy the well world, and I discovered very quickly that what they really wanted to do was to keep them being sued

38:50.320 --> 38:55.740
while they played around with the gimmick for a Saturday morning TV cartoon series.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.800
So I turned them down.

39:00.260 --> 39:07.640
There's some hope that the British are very, very interested in doing it as a radio serial. I'd love to see that.

39:09.820 --> 39:12.840
I hope that comes off, but the negotiations are out of my year.

39:15.340 --> 39:22.160
Yeah, okay. Let me move along for a few minutes to the one you're working on now. I assume you're still working on it, the Four Lords of the Diamond.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.020
Yeah, I've done three. I have the fourth one to do.

39:26.140 --> 39:31.240
Unlike the Well Books, this is really a single novel in four volumes.

39:32.400 --> 39:35.560
It's just the kind of idea that you must do that way.

39:36.420 --> 39:41.540
Otherwise, you have the world's largest book, and it has to be priced terribly, and nobody will buy it.

39:43.660 --> 39:49.260
Four Lords is there for several reasons.

39:49.260 --> 39:54.700
Number one, of course, the real problem that you have when you have a successful series like The Well

39:55.200 --> 40:00.700
is the same problem that, say, George Reeve's had as Superman. You get terribly tight cash.

40:01.740 --> 40:06.860
Not only that, everybody wants you to play Superman, you know, and don't want to play anything else.

40:07.380 --> 40:09.960
And if you're serious about your career, you've got to do other things.

40:11.580 --> 40:17.540
And so they kept coming after me to do Well Book after Well Book, and I said, wait a minute.

40:18.260 --> 40:22.120
I've got to stop and not do any Well Books for a while. Quite a while.

40:22.960 --> 40:29.740
And I've got to do other things. I've got to reestablish the fact that I am a serious novelist,

40:29.760 --> 40:35.020
and I'm not going to sell out like this, or else I'm never going to be able to write the things I want to write.

40:37.240 --> 40:39.440
It's very seductive because the money's very good.

40:39.940 --> 40:47.460
But of course, I've also been one of those people that's been terribly disappointed reading the fourth volume

40:47.460 --> 40:53.820
in a good three volume series. The more you do, if the books are not up to the previous books,

40:54.160 --> 40:55.520
they're even more of a disappointment.

40:57.300 --> 41:02.360
So I sat down and said, OK, they want another series. Let's do this one.

41:02.980 --> 41:08.240
This has originally been outlined as a single novel, but it was pretty obvious that it couldn't be done as a single novel.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.880
Just simply for size and cost.

41:12.900 --> 41:19.220
And it has a tremendous number of the elements that I have become known for.

41:19.420 --> 41:23.240
It has a lot of new material as well. It has a lot of political commentary.

41:23.820 --> 41:26.060
It has a lot of social commentary in it.

41:26.640 --> 41:31.640
It has also slam bang angst, action, Machiavellian intrigue, and everything else,

41:31.700 --> 41:35.260
because nobody's going to read your message if you don't entertain first.

41:37.440 --> 41:44.260
And these are four worlds in one system that are basically a prison planet series.

41:45.580 --> 41:48.160
And you get dropped on there.

41:48.800 --> 41:57.440
And the foundation idea, which appeals to me an awful lot, is that alien race discovers us before we discover them,

41:57.820 --> 42:01.740
decides that it can't win a war against us.

42:01.740 --> 42:09.220
Maybe they're just not as many of them, or there's technological problems or something like that.

42:09.980 --> 42:17.740
So they study us and study us, and they discover that as in all human societies, there is this massive criminal syndicate.

42:19.360 --> 42:30.360
And that these criminal syndicate leaders are mostly imprisoned for life on the four lords of the diamond, the Wharton diamond.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.160
These four worlds.

42:32.660 --> 42:43.340
So what the aliens do is they contact these bitter super crux, and they take out a contract on human civilization.

42:44.300 --> 42:51.200
They provide the technology and the four lords, the four syndicate chiefs,

42:51.200 --> 43:00.260
provide the expertise, know-how, and so on to bring down the government and maybe the social system.

43:00.740 --> 43:04.180
Maybe everything of human civilization.

43:05.220 --> 43:10.880
The reward that they're offered is that the four worlds have a biological trap.

43:11.240 --> 43:15.920
You die if you ever leave, and the aliens seem to have a way around this.

43:17.160 --> 43:23.380
And so the ultimate reward would be if you destroy human civilization, you not only get your revenge,

43:23.560 --> 43:28.940
but then you get to get off the planet and pick up the pieces and become the bosses yourself.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.260
So it becomes a big deal.

43:32.880 --> 43:41.400
And the idea is, is they've got to go into this Wharton diamond, and anybody they send in is going to get this disease

43:41.400 --> 43:45.780
and it's going to be stuck there the same way, which means they're going to have problems with their loyalties.

43:46.580 --> 43:47.720
And you keep somebody loyal.

43:49.140 --> 43:56.320
And they've got to go down there, try and find out what the aliens are, where they are, because nobody's seen them,

43:56.680 --> 43:58.800
nobody knows anything about them, it's all being done by proxy.

43:59.520 --> 44:09.940
They've got to find out as much of the plot as possible at the same time, by enough time, to prepare by hopefully knocking off the four lords of the diamond.

44:11.460 --> 44:11.980
Fascinating.

44:12.840 --> 44:21.240
So you have four different worlds, four exotic adventure-type worlds, each one of which is quite different,

44:22.000 --> 44:26.140
and the criminal leaders are all different as well.

44:26.320 --> 44:33.360
Some of them you might like better than the people who are leading human civilization, and some of them you won't.

44:34.940 --> 44:47.280
And the entire thing is throughout it all, you're trying to find out exactly why the aliens are there, what they're doing, who they are, everything about them.

44:47.740 --> 44:54.640
And there are just enough clues sprinkled along that maybe, hopefully not, somebody will be able to figure it out.

44:55.380 --> 44:57.180
I haven't done the last one yet.

44:57.180 --> 45:08.020
I might tell you that my editor doesn't know how it ends, my wife doesn't know how it ends, nobody with me knows how it ends, nobody with me knows pollution as well.

45:09.620 --> 45:19.060
And because the four books are happening simultaneously in four different places, what I'm doing is, I can't have any foreknowledge.

45:19.520 --> 45:25.280
I've got to put some distance between each book, so I'm writing something else between each of the four books.

45:26.260 --> 45:35.740
Right now I'm in the middle of a very different kind of novel, and a fantasy novel as a matter of fact.

45:36.380 --> 45:38.840
And when I finish that, then I'll do the last of the four books.

45:40.120 --> 45:46.020
I was fascinated with the first two. It's one of the few series that I am anxiously awaiting the outcome of it.

45:46.300 --> 45:50.140
Listen, we are at the end of a tape. Can we just change the tape quickly and ask you some more?
