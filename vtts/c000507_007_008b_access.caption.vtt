You mentioned a little bit about this already but just if you could summarize
for me. Your future plans for writing. What you might have planned for the

00:07.980 --> 00:25.160
future for writing science fiction? Or anything? Well, my future plans boil down
to kind of a step at a time. I find it hard to spend the emotional energy it

00:25.160 --> 00:34.320
takes to write while I'm involved with the chairmanship of the Department of
Anthropology and I have to in effect serve out my term and that's sort of the

00:34.320 --> 00:45.800
way I think of it as chairman before I can get back to my writing and I don't
know how specific I can be the only the only thing I can tell you is that I

00:45.800 --> 00:56.240
don't think my writing is over in fact I'm sure that it's not over the only way
you can stop me writing is to kill me, but what specific form it will take, I

00:56.240 --> 01:07.260
can't tell you. Some of it will certainly be science fiction, and I'd like to
think I can overcome my own law here, and I would like to think that my best

01:07.260 --> 01:16.020
work is still ahead of me, but everybody always says that, and it doesn't mean
that your best work is necessarily ahead of you, but I'm going to give it a

01:16.020 --> 01:24.420
shot. Very good, okay. Yeah, that's fine, Chad. Okay, is that all you need?
Well, yeah, we could talk for hours, but that's enough. Okay. That'll be great.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.860
Okay, I would, I do need a little.
