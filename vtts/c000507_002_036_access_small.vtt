00:01.560 --> 00:04.380
This is Daryl Lane. Keith Johnson. And David Carson.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.560
And the subject of this show will be First Contact.

00:07.660 --> 00:10.400
For over a century at least since H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds,

00:10.660 --> 00:13.660
Contact with Aliens has been one of the standard motifs of science fiction,

00:14.100 --> 00:15.320
and certainly one of the most popular.

00:15.920 --> 00:19.440
There are, of course, a number of possibilities coming under the heading of Alien Contact.

00:19.960 --> 00:23.860
The Aliens may be superior. We may be superior, or there may be equality.

00:24.340 --> 00:26.840
The Aliens might be friendly, hostile, or indifferent.

00:27.920 --> 00:32.520
One of the most popular and fascinating possibilities of all is the story of First Contact,

00:33.100 --> 00:36.040
one of which the first meeting between humans and aliens is treated.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.660
Our present show will be the first of two on the subject of First Contact.

00:44.380 --> 00:50.940
Of course, Wells started the tradition of the alien being both physically repulsive and hostile to human beings.

00:51.820 --> 00:56.940
And the pulp magazines picked it up through the late 20s and the early 30s into the 40s.

00:57.580 --> 01:01.700
The characteristic way of treating an alien was as a so-called bug-eyed monster.

01:02.220 --> 01:04.960
Then the movies picked it up and carried that on through the 50s,

01:04.980 --> 01:08.640
and, meantime, the literature took a different trend.

01:11.400 --> 01:16.960
In the 30s, around 1934 Stanley Weinbaum published his story,

01:17.040 --> 01:19.240
which was one of the landmarks in science fiction literature.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.640
It was entitled, The Modern Martian Odyssey.

01:23.180 --> 01:28.100
And it was the first treatment in the modern period of Aliens as sensitive creatures,

01:28.280 --> 01:33.920
ones who were not hostile or aggressive, who had an environment and ecology of their own.

01:35.300 --> 01:42.760
It took place on Mars, and Weinbaum created three or four different types of aliens on the planet.

01:43.900 --> 01:47.620
And it's interesting for us to go back and read about those aliens,

01:47.620 --> 01:49.960
because they were all based on the science of his day.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.540
For instance, one of them was a silicon creature.

01:53.320 --> 01:57.860
They knew that, well, they figured Mars was made up of sand, so one of the aliens,

01:58.660 --> 02:01.940
Weinbaum developed for the planet, was one who ate sand.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.680
This is quite possible.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.140
There are two kinds of chemicals that can support life, and carbon and silicon are the two.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.140
We're carbon-based, and silicon life is possible.

02:09.900 --> 02:14.120
And as Asimov pointed out with Weinbaum, he said he was the first one in the history of science fiction

02:15.140 --> 02:18.400
to develop an environment for an alien,

02:19.180 --> 02:22.120
conceiving of him as having come from a non-Earth environment,

02:22.220 --> 02:24.220
as being part of an ecology, which was non-human,

02:24.840 --> 02:27.220
having thought processes, which were non-human,

02:27.980 --> 02:30.200
having a logical system, which was non-human.

02:31.440 --> 02:37.560
And Weinbaum, of course, also made one of his aliens, anyhow, a creature named Tweedle,

02:37.560 --> 02:42.100
very friendly, a non-hostile, non-aggressive alien, which was very different

02:42.100 --> 02:45.180
from the bug-eyed monster tradition, and it went over very well.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.660
Weinbaum was in his late 20s when that story was published,

02:49.120 --> 02:53.160
and there was an immediate market, and immediate imitators doing that kind of story.

02:53.260 --> 02:59.260
An alien who was non-aggressive, with whom contact could be established,

03:00.020 --> 03:05.920
and as I said, that was in 1934, in Wonder Stories, when Weinbaum wrote that landmark story.

03:19.680 --> 03:24.280
There are several different kinds of first contact, and we're going to be talking about most of them in this treatment.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.660
One of that being mankind's first encounter with alien beings.

03:28.220 --> 03:34.640
Are mankind and several other alien races coming in contact with a new alien race?

03:35.480 --> 03:39.300
Yeah, I think that has to be the criterion that no matter how many aliens have been contacted,

03:39.780 --> 03:44.260
there still is that special feeling about meeting up with a brand new alien culture,

03:44.360 --> 03:48.540
and the humans have to be involved with it, of course, no matter if they're along with other aliens or not.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.580
I think that has to be the main criterion of alien contact.

03:53.020 --> 04:02.720
Of course, the meeting up with the original first race is the most exciting and most important one,

04:03.080 --> 04:08.160
because up until that time, the human race doesn't even know whether there are other races in existence, presumably.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.860
After one has been in existence, then the rest, you kind of assume, are going to be there.

04:12.820 --> 04:20.840
Usually, a first contact story will be very much tied to its particular culture or historical era.

04:21.300 --> 04:27.000
Today, for instance, we're very much tied up with more sophisticated approaches or more sophisticated environments for it,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.100
simply because we are expecting it to happen.

04:30.180 --> 04:35.280
But way back in the 30s and 40s, not long after the days of the bug-eyed monster motifs,

04:35.840 --> 04:40.220
many of the stories about first contact would be tied to what was happening in the world,

04:40.580 --> 04:43.900
for instance, wars, racial aggressions, and so forth.

04:44.020 --> 04:47.820
After all, another race is alien.

04:50.400 --> 04:56.200
Xenophobia or hatred of strangers, for instance, can take place within the human race, not just with alien creatures.

04:56.960 --> 05:02.960
And probably one of the best first contact stories of all by Murray Leinster, entitled,

05:03.620 --> 05:04.940
Appropriately Enough First Contact.

05:07.860 --> 05:15.040
A spaceship meets up with another, well, a spaceship from Earth meets up with a spaceship from another culture,

05:15.160 --> 05:17.320
the first time that any kind of alien has ever been contacted.

05:18.360 --> 05:23.860
And one of the things that happens in the story before they actually meet the humans on their ship are

05:24.660 --> 05:28.520
discussing and worrying and wondering about what kinds of creatures are going to meet.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.980
And Leinster has one of the characters say this,

05:33.660 --> 05:35.260
what are we going to do about them?

05:35.740 --> 05:39.120
Maybe these creatures will be aesthetic marvels, nice and friendly and polite,

05:39.800 --> 05:42.980
and underneath with the sneaking, brutal ferocity of a Japanese.

05:44.260 --> 05:49.960
Now, you obviously know that was written during the middle 40s, during the Second World War,

05:50.020 --> 05:51.100
when the Japanese were our enemy.

05:51.660 --> 05:55.980
But you'll find that often to be a motif of the first contact story.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.480
But if I remember, that story did have a happy ending.

05:59.140 --> 06:06.480
They did, they did, Leinster speculated that perhaps there would be friendliness between the two cultures.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.980
The way he did that was fairly clever, though.

06:08.700 --> 06:13.300
Wasn't that the case in which the two different crews actually switched spaceships,

06:13.380 --> 06:16.800
so they went back to each other's planets in each other's spaceships,

06:17.160 --> 06:19.820
and avoided revealing too much about themselves that way?

06:19.820 --> 06:23.860
Yeah, that's one of the problems you'll meet in many first contact stories,

06:24.200 --> 06:30.460
that we don't want them to know where we are, and presumably they wouldn't want us to know where they are.

06:31.480 --> 06:35.040
And so one particular branch of the first contact story is when the two cultures,

06:35.180 --> 06:38.580
the humans and the aliens, meet somewhere in a neutral space.

06:39.640 --> 06:44.460
And the whole subject of that first contact story was the aliens and the humans were wondering

06:44.460 --> 06:46.580
how can we keep them from knowing where we come from.

06:49.220 --> 06:52.980
Another way an author might introduce a first contact story would be in the way that

06:52.980 --> 06:57.860
Howe Clement designed his story, The Needle, written in 1950.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.360
That being that it's a first contact story in reverse.

07:03.860 --> 07:07.200
It's the story of an alien making first contact with people on Earth.

07:08.300 --> 07:15.700
And the alien in this particular story is, his form is alien, but his feelings, his motives,

07:15.700 --> 07:18.340
his emotions are very much human.

07:19.020 --> 07:23.340
Therefore, that the reader is able to empathize with him and his plight.

07:24.040 --> 07:29.660
The alien is more or less a detective and he is chasing a criminal.

07:30.760 --> 07:35.360
The alien's form is a small gelatinous mass.

07:36.540 --> 07:41.320
And they work in a parasitic relationship with a host.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.800
And that's how the contact is made.

07:45.780 --> 07:54.000
The alien hero inhabits the body of a young man and they, through various methods,

07:55.040 --> 07:57.180
are able to contact and communicate with each other.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.160
And then they go off in search of the criminal and eventually find and dispose of him.

08:03.440 --> 08:08.320
You think that's fair? You said that the alien was more or less that human feeling.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.760
You mentioned the fact that he was chasing a criminal.

08:12.520 --> 08:17.980
To me, a good first contact story, a good story about aliens, must have a credible alien.

08:18.880 --> 08:25.000
Surely some creature developing on another planet, another galaxy,

08:25.900 --> 08:29.500
would have a whole system of logic, a whole feelings if they had feelings at all.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.460
And we're totally non-human.

08:30.680 --> 08:34.600
In fact, it probably would be very difficult to understand him from the basis of our psychology.

08:34.600 --> 08:40.980
The trouble is it's much easier for a writer to create, say, a bug-eyed monster,

08:41.080 --> 08:47.540
than to try and create an alien and his whole ecology and his whole society simultaneously

08:47.540 --> 08:50.420
and make it incredibly different from human society.

08:50.720 --> 08:51.940
It's a tough thing because we're all humans.

08:52.500 --> 08:58.820
Well, I think the early presentation of the aliens, what we would call unsophisticated,

08:58.920 --> 09:00.000
I think they almost had to do that.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.420
I mean, an alien was usually something that looked weird, but felt like a human being.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.720
Right. And quite often they emphasized physical or physiological characteristics.

09:10.980 --> 09:14.380
He's alien because he's got five arms and three heads and so forth.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.420
And they didn't consider things like his psychology.

09:16.980 --> 09:20.100
Later on, this became a little bit more evident.

09:20.700 --> 09:29.060
In fact, a lot of different parts of human culture were considered in the first contact stories.

09:29.060 --> 09:33.520
For example, even religion, in the case of James Blish's case of conscience,

09:33.840 --> 09:38.240
in which an entire planet, according to what Blish is trying to make us believe,

09:38.660 --> 09:41.420
has been created by the adversary, by Satan.

09:42.020 --> 09:47.580
And the aliens on this, reptilian, though they may be, are perfect creatures

09:47.580 --> 09:50.660
who have not evidently been involved in original sin.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.000
They're still living in essentially a garden of Eden sort of thing.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.700
And the reaction of the human protagonist to this is the focus of the novel.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.820
The aliens on the planet were reptilian or like small dinosaurs.

10:03.740 --> 10:08.640
They were like a race of Vulcans, Mr. Spock, from Star Trek, and that they used pure reason.

10:08.860 --> 10:11.680
That's one of the things that bothered the protagonist, the Jesuit priest,

10:11.860 --> 10:18.460
is that they had a perfect society, a perfect culture, yet they had no such thing as faith,

10:19.060 --> 10:22.640
no such thing as religion, in fact, very unemotional, in fact, no emotions.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.500
They went totally unreasoned and they had a perfect culture.

10:26.120 --> 10:30.220
And to the priest, that shook the very foundations of his faith,

10:30.520 --> 10:33.640
because to have religion, to have faith, you have to have faith.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.740
And these creatures did not know what that was.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.420
So it was a crisis of conscience for him.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.100
The ending of that novel, you might remember, was very ambiguous.

10:43.620 --> 10:46.340
I think Blish intended for that to be so.

10:47.660 --> 10:53.060
The planet was created out of an element, lithium, I believe, that was inherently unstable.

10:53.800 --> 10:59.660
And when an earthman landed on the planet or started to set up factories of a certain kind on the planet

10:59.660 --> 11:05.460
to use this lithium ore, either he caused the planet to disintegrate or to blow up,

11:05.820 --> 11:11.140
or the priest at the end of the novel exercises the planet and it disappears.

11:12.820 --> 11:18.440
And you are not told which actually was effective in the destruction of the alien race.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.320
Some readers might find that novel a little bit slow, but I think it's a fascinating treatment

11:22.320 --> 11:28.480
and probably more than, I would say, more than 90% of the first contact stories and novels that have been written.

11:28.560 --> 11:34.280
I think it's probably truer to some of the feelings that the human race will have

11:34.280 --> 11:36.520
when we actually do make first contact.

11:37.120 --> 11:42.480
I think one of the first problems the human race will have is, are these creatures created by God?

11:43.220 --> 11:44.060
Do they have souls?

11:44.900 --> 11:47.260
Given the fact they have intelligence, yet do they have souls?

11:47.760 --> 11:52.040
I think it's very easy here to see an analogy between the explorers of the old world,

11:52.160 --> 11:56.660
the Spanish particularly, when they came to the New World and discovered the Indian cultures.

11:57.240 --> 12:04.520
They had philosophical theological debates on whether these creatures, these Indians, had souls.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.880
They could kill them and say, well, there's nothing wrong with this, they're animals, they don't have souls.

12:09.660 --> 12:12.140
I think we're going to have that problem when we do run across aliens.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.280
It's going to be a religious problem.

12:15.080 --> 12:23.340
And I think Blis's book, A Case of Conscience, is probably the, well, is the classic treatment of that particular aspect of first contact.

12:25.200 --> 12:31.800
Another value or another insight that a first contact story can give people is to put a perspective on the human race.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.220
Of course, we think of ourselves usually as the center of the universe.

12:36.500 --> 12:42.200
We think of ourselves as being the most intelligent creatures, at least on this planet, if not in the universe, of the galaxy.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.620
And there are a number of first contact stories in which we learn humility.

12:47.840 --> 12:52.100
One of the best I think is Gordon R. Dixon's Dolphin's Way, published in the mid-60s.

12:52.380 --> 12:58.680
John Varley's universe, a good part of it, or the background in many of his books, comes from a similar idea.

12:58.680 --> 13:09.380
A group of a race of super powerful invading beings has taken over the earth and has decided to contact the most intelligent species,

13:09.600 --> 13:11.300
which in this case are dolphins and killer whales.

13:11.860 --> 13:21.600
In fact, we learn at one point in one of his novels that the invaders classify human intelligence, or classify terrestrial intelligences on three levels.

13:21.940 --> 13:24.660
There are the intelligent ones, which are dolphins and killer whales.

13:24.660 --> 13:38.240
There are hive minds, or levels in which groups of species can work together, like an ant colony or a termite colony.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.080
And he groups human beings along with these.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.760
Human beings are not intelligent individually, according to this classification.

13:44.140 --> 13:45.500
And on the third level are animals.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.260
And that's a very humiliating thing.

13:47.260 --> 13:54.920
The invaders wipe out civilization on the earth completely, human civilization anyway, without even stopping to worry about it.

13:55.180 --> 13:57.480
And they don't even contact human beings.

13:59.940 --> 14:09.100
Usually in most of these first contact stories, even if the contact is negative, that is, the humans are made into an inferior race,

14:09.200 --> 14:13.780
or are shown as an inferior race compared to the aliens, at least there are some kind of communication possibilities.

14:14.860 --> 14:22.120
In truth, it might be the case that an alien would be so different from human beings, we wouldn't even be able to communicate with them.

14:22.220 --> 14:25.220
There are psychologists who would be so different that we'd have no common meeting ground.

14:25.860 --> 14:30.880
Or the technology on both sides, or the lack of it, maybe such that there would be no communication.

14:31.720 --> 14:36.520
Yes, their technology may be so far ahead of ours that we don't even think the same as they do.

14:37.260 --> 14:42.280
I think one of the more interesting treatments in first contact would be Stanislaw Limb's Solaris.

14:42.280 --> 14:53.660
In that mankind has found a planet orbiting around a binary star system, but the planet's orbit is stable, which would be impossible.

14:53.960 --> 15:01.920
So they go to the planet to investigate why this planet's orbit is stable, and find out that the ocean on this planet,

15:02.020 --> 15:07.320
which comprises most of the planet except for a few islands, is sentient or intelligent.

15:07.320 --> 15:14.200
So they set up stations and start trying to communicate with the planet, and therein lies the crux of the story.

15:15.420 --> 15:27.600
The hero, Chris Kelvin, has landed on a space station orbiting Solaris, and it has a few members of the crew left alive,

15:27.600 --> 15:30.260
a Dr. Snow and a Dr. Satorius.

15:31.860 --> 15:40.840
They both are, in essence, hiding out in certain parts of the ship and staying closed away from each other,

15:41.540 --> 15:47.800
and Kelvin has the responsibility or the obligation of finding out why all this is going on.

15:48.380 --> 15:56.640
During the early part of Kelvin's stay on the space station, his dead wife, Rayya, is materialized on board the ship by the ocean Solaris.

15:58.260 --> 16:05.640
He is immediately horrified and finds a way to get rid of his first wife by sending her off in a ship,

16:06.280 --> 16:10.740
and about a day or two after that happens, his wife is rematerialized on the ship.

16:11.200 --> 16:16.740
This time her body is not composed of atoms and molecules the way we know them.

16:17.100 --> 16:23.640
It's composed of neutrinos being extremely dense, but aside from that makeup of her form,

16:23.640 --> 16:28.780
she is totally human in every respect and is deeply in love with him.

16:28.940 --> 16:35.780
His wife had committed suicide previously because Kelvin had left her, and she, in essence, died of loneliness.

16:37.560 --> 16:43.760
There ensues a type of morality play in which Kelvin tries to deduce why his wife is materialized at this particular time and space,

16:47.100 --> 16:55.020
and there's several levels to the story at this point in which Kelvin is trying to figure out why she got there, how she got there,

16:56.340 --> 17:06.280
why all this is happening at this particular point in time, and he finally deduces that it was the ocean which materialized his wife,

17:06.280 --> 17:16.300
because his wife has knowledge which she would not have normally had had she been a living person and entity.

17:16.520 --> 17:23.360
She had knowledge of Kelvin's, some of his innermost thoughts which he had kept secret from his wife while she was alive.

17:24.780 --> 17:38.060
And in the end of the story, even though Kelvin can communicate with the creation of Solaris, he cannot communicate with Solaris itself.

17:38.340 --> 17:49.260
The concepts, the thought processes, our emotions, if there are any, of this being which is literally an ocean on this entire planet,

17:49.260 --> 18:04.120
are so far from that of human emotions of thought processes, there can be no direct contact, and the enigma of Solaris at the beginning of the book is left the same at the end of the book.

18:04.540 --> 18:08.720
You probably call that a thought novel, wouldn't you? More or less on the...

18:08.720 --> 18:12.360
It's very much, I would call, psychological science fiction.

18:13.260 --> 18:20.540
It's not so much the action, the typical hero or heroine, but the possibilities.

18:21.300 --> 18:24.160
Yeah, the psychological interplay between the two cultures and so forth.

18:41.000 --> 18:50.080
One of the more intelligently written first contact stories to come out recently was a Moten God's Eye by Larry Niven and Jerry Pernell, and Keith Johnson has a critique on that book.

18:52.020 --> 18:58.340
Larry Niven and Jerry Pernell have collaborated on several works. The Moten God's Eye is perhaps their most successful effort.

18:59.080 --> 19:03.580
It is a return to the bug-eyed monster theme, but with some significant differences from the usual treatments.

19:04.580 --> 19:10.220
The plot is an exciting and complex one, so much so that the reader will probably not pick up every twist upon the first reading.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.460
The action takes place in the future history that has been constructed by Pernell.

19:15.240 --> 19:25.780
Mankind has spread out among the stars. He has started wars and built up empires, and at the time of Moat has begun rebuilding a new empire from the ashes of the most recent galaxy-wide conflict.

19:26.320 --> 19:31.560
But then the monster arrives. She is not recognized as a monster upon arrival.

19:32.140 --> 19:38.480
Not until books end do the protagonist realize that this totally alien species that they have met is the deadly enemy of all humans.

19:38.920 --> 19:44.240
This terrible secret is revealed gradually, piece by piece, to the reader in a very hitchcocky and way.

19:45.380 --> 19:50.120
That first alien visitor has come into human space on the wings of a solar sail after a very long journey.

19:50.840 --> 19:55.820
Human beings do not learn a great deal from the creature, however, largely because she is dead by the time they pick her up.

19:56.580 --> 20:01.780
So the empire decides to send a scientific and military expedition to the planet inhabited by the alien race.

20:02.760 --> 20:07.760
The expedition is commandeered by a character who is a cross between George Patton and Nikita Khrushchev.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.540
His characterization provokes some humor in places.

20:11.480 --> 20:17.460
The captain of a second ship, Rod Blaine, is the real hero, however, and he undergoes some unusual and suspenseful adventures.

20:18.280 --> 20:22.380
His crew meets the aliens, talks with them, studies them, and becomes rather friendly with them.

20:23.020 --> 20:28.280
In fact, before too long, the captain finds his ship overrun with aliens. Very small ones.

20:28.280 --> 20:33.400
You see, the aliens come in several versions. There are administrators and ambassador types.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.180
There are strong, stupid farmers and small, dexterous doctors.

20:38.120 --> 20:42.740
These are not simply different occupations. They are completely separate subspecies of the alien race.

20:43.760 --> 20:49.120
On Earth, the situation would be similar if gorillas had evolved a low level of human intelligence and become farmers.

20:49.740 --> 20:53.520
Orangutans had become electrical engineers and chimpanzees had become jet pilots.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.980
We humans, of course, would be the administrators.

20:57.140 --> 20:59.380
Or perhaps we would be professional warriors.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.080
This is one of the aliens' deadly secrets.

21:02.680 --> 21:10.280
One of their forms is made up of a powerful, vicious set of super soldiers who could make the alien equivalent of mincemeat out of any human military man.

21:11.380 --> 21:16.020
But there is a more terrible fact concealed by the aliens, and that is overpopulation.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.020
Every alien must be made pregnant periodically, or she will die.

21:20.020 --> 21:27.220
This has, of course, led to terrible overcrowding on the planet, so much so that periodically civilization has blasted itself back to savagery.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.540
The planet has gone through thousands of these cycles of growth and catastrophe.

21:32.400 --> 21:39.520
That pattern has imbued the race with a deep, frustrating fatalism, a sense of futility that makes their psychology very different from that of us humans.

21:40.380 --> 21:44.460
At one point, a crew member who has stumbled across the secret exclaims to one of the creatures,

21:44.460 --> 21:48.920
but man, there's got to be a way to solve this, to which the alien replies,

21:49.680 --> 21:51.920
I am not a man, and there doesn't got to be a way.

21:52.380 --> 21:55.540
And that's another reason I don't want contact between your species and mine.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.840
You're all crazy. You think every problem has a solution.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.300
The action is fast throughout the novel.

22:03.180 --> 22:06.420
The crew of Captain Blaine's ship have interesting adventures with the friendly aliens.

22:07.220 --> 22:13.440
Three of his crewmen are unknowingly abandoned on the planet and have some hair-raising adventures with unfriendly aliens, ending in their deaths.

22:13.440 --> 22:18.400
The unsuspecting expedition returns home. They even bring three of the beings with them.

22:19.440 --> 22:25.580
But in true space opera fashion, the heroes uncover the truth by means of their human cleverness and isolate the aliens in their home system.

22:26.140 --> 22:29.940
And the novel ends, as do many of Niven's works, somewhat inconclusively.

22:31.080 --> 22:35.460
The book offers several fascinating new concepts and more than a few contrasting features.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.120
Perhaps these are a result of the dual authorship.

22:38.120 --> 22:44.740
The empire is dreadfully old-fashioned, is modeled after a 15th-century monarchy with its hierarchical structure.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.140
Women are worshiped in a way that must have set Ursula Le Guin's teeth on edge.

22:49.980 --> 22:52.720
There is a distinct flavor of space opera in the action.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.680
Yet there are some recent social issues incorporated in the book.

22:57.360 --> 23:04.280
The overpopulation problem of the aliens is probably Niven's idea of the dangers that face human society before the end of the century today.

23:05.420 --> 23:10.040
Again, the aliens are old-fashioned monsters, even if nobody realizes it at first.

23:10.940 --> 23:15.620
We are led to understand why they are monstrous, however, almost to the point of sympathizing with them.

23:16.320 --> 23:21.220
One of the most difficult tasks in the writing of science fiction is the construction of a truly alien being.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.860
Pornell and Niven have done an admirable job.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.160
The novel is not without flaws.

23:26.880 --> 23:30.140
Human society is depressingly similar to today's version of it.

23:30.140 --> 23:34.860
And there are some funny anachronisms, which I suspect my colleagues will bring up in a few moments.

23:35.780 --> 23:40.800
But for imaginative invention and excitement, the motin god's eye will fit on anyone's bookshelf.

23:44.260 --> 23:46.720
Niven and Pornell have done something very interesting in that book.

23:47.380 --> 23:54.560
Earlier, we had all of us recognized and mentioned that there's been an increase in sophistication from the early treatment of aliens.

23:54.560 --> 24:00.340
These bug-eyed monsters, evolving through wine bomb story where they are friendly and non-aggressive.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.120
This in a sense is a return to the bug-eyed monster.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.980
They don't look like bug-eyed monsters.

24:05.160 --> 24:09.680
In fact, some of the humans, if I remember, almost want to pet them because they have soft fur on their bodies.

24:10.180 --> 24:17.560
But on the other hand, their exterior appearance belies a very hostile intention toward humans.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.040
So in a sense, this is going backwards.

24:19.040 --> 24:34.420
Another interesting fact that, or what, sophisticated or clever thing that Niven and Pornell have done in the book is the levels of comparative intelligence between the humans and the moties, as I believe they're called in the book, because they come from the moat.

24:35.880 --> 24:41.720
When you come right down to it, the moties or the aliens were more intelligent than the humans were.

24:41.820 --> 24:42.360
Yes, very much so.

24:42.360 --> 24:49.240
It was only the lack of an interstellar drive, I think, that had caused them to remain in their own little section of the galaxy.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.940
They were bottled up in their own solar system.

24:51.400 --> 24:51.500
Yes.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.400
In fact, it was kind of an interesting twist.

24:53.900 --> 25:07.940
Quite often we read about galactic empires, asimovs and many others, in which the human beings are asked whether they want to join this benevolent galaxy-wide empire.

25:07.940 --> 25:14.100
And here it's the other way around. The aliens still are more intelligent and more competent than we are, but they're asking whether they can join our empire.

25:29.620 --> 25:32.480
This is Daryl Lane, Keith Johnson, and David Carson.
