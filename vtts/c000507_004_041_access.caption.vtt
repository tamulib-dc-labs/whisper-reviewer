Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show so stay with us.

00:28.140 --> 00:33.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.400
And here are your hosts.

00:42.640 --> 00:50.180
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. Charles Sheffield is a relatively new name in
the field of science fiction but he's published first-class stories and novels

00:50.180 --> 00:58.840
since 1976. Sheffield is a practicing scientist and as you might expect his work
can be categorized as hard science fiction. His novels include Sight of Proteus,

00:58.840 --> 01:06.280
Web Between the Worlds, and My Brother's Keeper. He's also had three volumes of
short stories published. We spoke with Sheffield recently and asked him how he

01:06.280 --> 01:18.320
first got involved in science fiction. I read it from the time I was about 13 or
14 years old but where I was living the idea of fandom was unknown at the time. I

01:18.320 --> 01:30.100
was raised in East Yorkshire in England and so far as I knew for a long time, in
fact until I went off to the university, I was the only person I knew who read

01:30.100 --> 01:42.100
science fiction and then when I got to the university I found it was not all
that uncommon. But at least until I was 18 it was a private activity and there

01:42.100 --> 01:51.940
was no organized effort. There were no groups of people discussing it. There were
no conventions or anything like that. It was a solitary reading activity and I

01:51.940 --> 02:02.880
got into it uh simply because I was interested in science and it was the only
type of writing apart from science fact that appealed to someone interested in

02:02.880 --> 02:13.580
science. There wasn't much of it around of course. The period I'm talking about
there were no English magazines that I recall and about the only things that

02:13.580 --> 02:26.640
came over from the United States were Astounding, which then became Analog, and
Galaxy and occasionally Amazing Stories and Fantastic Stories and that was about

02:26.640 --> 02:37.760
it. We asked Sheffield if he had had a long apprenticeship with rejection slips
before selling his first story. It was a reasonably long one. Uh I can't say that

02:37.760 --> 02:50.720
I'm I'm I had an endless string of rejections. I started to write in '76 and
didn't have any previous background of trying to write fiction of any kind so I

02:50.720 --> 03:02.720
wasn't too discouraged because I realized in my first story or two that I was
evolving rapidly. In other words I could reread things of a few months before and

03:02.720 --> 03:10.260
say my lord no wonder nobody would buy that. But once Sheffield hit his stride,
his stories became familiar to readers of the science fiction magazines. They

03:10.260 --> 03:17.800
were always exciting and inventive. Sheffield, as we mentioned earlier, belongs to
that small group of science fiction writers who are practicing scientists. He has

03:17.800 --> 03:26.480
a degree in theoretical physics and is a vice president of the Earth Satellite
Corporation of Washington DC. We asked him what the corporation does. What we do

03:26.480 --> 03:39.720
is we take information from satellites that look at the earth as opposed to
looking out in space somewhere and we use that information in looking for

03:39.720 --> 03:49.560
natural resources on the earth and in measuring them and monitoring them. So for
instance we have exploration programs in which we look for oil and gas and

03:49.560 --> 04:00.700
minerals around the world. We have other projects in which we analyze the
condition of surface water or of land use. We're just finishing a big project. The

04:00.700 --> 04:11.140
state of Pennsylvania looking at their abandoned mine lands to see what
condition they're in and that's done from sometimes from aerial observations in

04:11.140 --> 04:18.880
aircraft but mostly we use satellite data. The company is now approaching

04:18.880 --> 04:29.580
thirteen years old and in a sense was started too soon. I was there at the
beginning, but our first few years were very difficult because we found that we

04:29.580 --> 04:39.300
were in a field in which almost no one knew what we were doing and we would
spend lots of our time trying to explain to people the potential that we

04:39.300 --> 04:50.480
believed we could see in the field. Well, now enough people have seen examples
of it that we find it much easier. So things have become much smoother for the

04:50.480 --> 04:55.480
company in the last few years. Next time, we'll talk with Charles Sheffield
about his work.

05:02.760 --> 05:10.600
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:10.600 --> 05:11.360
Odessa, Texas.

06:02.100 --> 06:06.060
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:21.740 --> 06:27.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.400
And here are your hosts.

06:35.880 --> 06:44.300
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon. Charles Sheffield's popular and provocative
1979 novel, The Web Between the Worlds, concerns a so-called space elevator. A

06:44.300 --> 06:51.460
space elevator is a satellite that is tethered to the Earth. Of course, it would
always remain above the same spot on the Earth's surface, or in other words, it

06:51.460 --> 06:59.280
would be in geosynchronous orbit. Sheffield has his engineers build a satellite
in the tether, which is hundreds of kilometers long, out in space. The end of

06:59.280 --> 07:06.780
this beanstalk, as it's called, is then guided toward a point on the Earth's
equator. A huge hole is waiting for it. As the end of the beanstalk enters the

07:06.780 --> 07:14.460
hole, millions of tons of dirt and rock are exploded over it, firmly anchoring
it. Since Sheffield is a practicing physicist, he describes the whole touchy

07:14.460 --> 07:23.120
operation in believable scientific language. We ask him, though, if this method
of anchoring a space elevator is a feasible one. It's about the only way, I

07:23.120 --> 07:33.680
think, in practice. You have to hold the thing down by weight on the Earth's
end. In other words, what you've got to do is to make sure there's just enough

07:33.680 --> 07:47.580
mass at the bottom sitting there. Now, there's several ways you could propose to
do that. One is to build the satellite from orbit at synchronous altitude down

07:47.580 --> 07:57.240
to the Earth, and then anchoring it is an easier job, because you can put
material into it a little at a time. You can bootstrap, if you like, and make a

07:57.240 --> 08:09.380
very small cable and gradually build up to a larger one. I think that the
technology we will have in 100 years' time, though, is such that things we now

08:09.380 --> 08:20.660
consider hair-raising and scary and difficult, people will take for granted. To
give an analogy, I like to quote, if you told people 100 years ago that there'd

08:20.660 --> 08:29.040
be hundreds of tons of metal up above the cities, they'd say, well, you could
never sleep at night because you'd be afraid they'd fall on top of you all the

08:29.040 --> 08:37.520
time. But now people just curse aircraft because of the noise. They don't
actually think that there's hundreds of tons of metal suspended up there. And

08:37.520 --> 08:48.740
we're not in constant fear of things collapsing because we have some trust in
the technology. I believe 100 or 150 years from now, things we now consider hair

08:48.740 --> 09:01.360
-raising and scary will be commonplace, which is why I chose a more way-out
method of anchoring the beanstalk than the simplest one. Though the book deals

09:01.360 --> 09:07.920
with numerous scientific concepts and theories, it's an exciting, fast-paced
story that should please any reader of science fiction. One of the non-human

09:07.920 --> 09:15.840
characters in the book is a giant squid named Caliban. Caliban seems to be
intelligent. He lives on the artificial water world of Atlantis and communicates

09:15.840 --> 09:25.880
with humans with the aid of a computer. We asked Sheffield where he got the idea
of using a giant squid as a character. I needed... Well, for several reasons.

09:26.020 --> 09:37.520
One is I'm very interested in cephalopods, in the squid and the octopus, because
they are the most advanced invertebrate animals. And I had known for quite a

09:37.520 --> 09:51.060
while that squids and octopuses are supposed to be very smart creatures. So when
I wanted a very difficult being to communicate with, the obvious first thought,

09:51.140 --> 10:02.840
which many people do, is to have a computer as a character. But I felt, since I
had a water world in Atlantis, it would be more interesting for me to create a

10:02.840 --> 10:13.940
situation in which the sea creature, Caliban, communicates with the humans only
with the help of a computer. In other words, the computer is an essential part

10:13.940 --> 10:23.700
of the communication process, and the relationship between the computer and
Caliban is a very complex one that even the human characters in the book say

10:23.700 --> 10:34.740
they don't totally know what's going on. I simply felt that was more interesting
than perhaps having a computer as an instrument. A smart computer has been done

10:34.740 --> 10:43.700
quite a lot, but I felt the computer and cephalopod combination hadn't been done
anywhere that I could see and was a more interesting thing to write about. We'll

10:43.700 --> 10:45.920
continue our talk with Charles Sheffield on our next show.

10:53.120 --> 11:00.940
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

11:00.940 --> 11:01.700
Odessa, Texas.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.700
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:10.520 --> 12:15.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.140
And here are your hosts.

12:24.280 --> 12:32.380
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. Charles Sheffield's most recent science
fiction novel, published in 1982, is entitled My Brother's Keeper, and it's a

12:32.380 --> 12:39.520
departure from his normal style. It's a fast-paced book, as all of Sheffield's
works are. But it's set in the very near future, and it reads like a spy novel.

12:39.760 --> 12:49.300
Sheffield talks about it. With that book, I actually tried to write in a
different style than the one I usually write. I tried, I've been, I'm very fond

12:49.300 --> 12:58.400
of a man who writes straight thrillers, a man called Dick Francis, who doesn't
write science fiction. He usually writes about horses, as a matter of fact, and

12:58.400 --> 13:08.920
he's an English writer. And one of the things I liked about Dick Francis is he
writes an extremely fast-moving book. And I decided to see if I could write a

13:08.920 --> 13:18.140
faster-moving book than I had written before. And that's what My Brother's
Keeper was my attempt to do it within the science fiction framework. The science

13:18.140 --> 13:26.000
fiction aspects of the story concerns introsomatic chips, tiny microcomputer
devices which are implanted in the human body to control various physiological

13:26.000 --> 13:34.060
functions. Twin brothers named Leo and Lionel are the main characters in the
story. Leo leads an exciting life of intrigue and danger as a government agent

13:34.060 --> 13:42.460
involved with the introsomatic chips. And Lionel is a conservative man who is a
world-renowned concert pianist, hearted the adventuresome type. After a

13:42.460 --> 13:49.260
helicopter accident involving the two brothers, Leo is dying. He is saved, in a
sense, by a brilliant doctor-scientist who removes part of his brain and

13:49.260 --> 13:58.280
attaches it to Lionel's. Their personalities are sort of integrated then, and
they slowly become one new person. What had been happening through the book is

13:58.280 --> 14:07.940
that it begins, Lionel, although he is the one with the consciousness, he's the
one who thinks he knows who he is when they recover consciousness, has always

14:07.940 --> 14:17.340
been the subordinate partner. His brother Leo had always been the stronger
personality, the more outgoing one, and really the dominant one. Now, through

14:17.340 --> 14:29.500
the book, Lionel is gradually taking on more of his brother's characteristics.
And certainly at the beginning of the book, Lionel would never have dreamed of

14:29.500 --> 14:40.880
going off and chasing danger, because it wasn't his disposition. So that by the
end, they have somewhat fused in personality, to the point where it's Leo who is

14:40.880 --> 14:51.800
really driving them along to go out and go after the criminals for the same
reason he had always done it, which is that it was the best form of excitement.

14:52.020 --> 15:01.640
He got excitement from it, and he said at the end that there's really no thrill
like it, which is this type of chase. But that, in a sense, is Leo's personality

15:01.640 --> 15:16.340
speaking by that point. Lionel was the somewhat quiet and retiring twin, but by
the end of the book, it's no longer Lionel who is making most of the decisions.

15:16.680 --> 15:22.200
Leo has again become the dominant twin in a psychological sense. That's the
thing I had in mind.

15:30.580 --> 15:37.340
The brain operation which joins the two brothers is not feasible presently, but
Sheffield says it may not be too long before the technique becomes possible.

15:37.540 --> 15:45.540
This is a typical Sheffield story, and then it's based on techniques or devices
that are just over the horizon that may be possible in a decade or two. Right.

15:45.920 --> 15:52.860
Sheffield is a convincing extrapolator, too, because he is a practicing
scientist with a Ph.D. in theoretical physics. We asked Sheffield if he writes

15:52.860 --> 16:05.760
his stories to seriously examine such concepts, or if he's just playing around
with wild ideas. It depends on the story. If I believe that the device is

16:05.760 --> 16:17.000
technologically possible and that someday we will have it, then I try to develop
the consequences of that rather seriously. And in a sense, I'm attempting

16:17.000 --> 16:28.580
prediction as opposed to writing entertainment. But on the other hand, if I
don't really believe something is likely to happen at all, then I'm writing for

16:28.580 --> 16:36.540
the fun of it. I'm writing and don't expect to be taken seriously. We'll
continue our conversation with Charles Sheffield on our next show.

16:43.500 --> 16:51.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:51.400 --> 16:52.140
Odessa, Texas.

17:43.620 --> 17:47.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:03.340 --> 18:08.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.060
And here are your hosts.

18:17.560 --> 18:25.060
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon. One of the more fascinating collections of
fantasy stories to come out in recent years is Charles Sheffield's 1982 book,

18:25.200 --> 18:33.320
Erasmus Magister. Sheffield is a scientist, and he's noted as an author of hard
science fiction stories, but he also writes in various styles and on unexpected

18:33.320 --> 18:41.280
subjects, as Erasmus Magister demonstrates. The title refers to the main
character in all of the book's stories, Erasmus Darwin, who lived in England's

18:41.280 --> 18:49.440
18th century and was the grandfather of Charles Darwin. We asked Sheffield if
Erasmus was a real historical figure. Yes, I've been interested in him for a

18:49.440 --> 19:03.020
long time. As somebody I found much more fascinating as a personality than his
grandson, Charles Darwin. Erasmus Darwin I had known about since I first went to

19:03.020 --> 19:12.460
Cambridge because he attended the same college at Cambridge as I did, and there
were books about him in the library and so on, and so I have an early

19:12.460 --> 19:24.620
fascination with him. And I found him especially interesting because he did so
many different things and was a poet and a philosopher and an inventor and a

19:24.620 --> 19:37.880
famous physician, and he's just a fascinating combination. I decided that what I
would try to do would be to have him apply his powers of observation, which were

19:37.880 --> 19:49.500
famous throughout Europe in his day. He was noted for being able to diagnose
diseases by looking at people and observing them closely. I decided that that

19:49.500 --> 19:59.060
power of observation would serve him well if he had to solve other mysteries. He
was also a person who was strongly rationalistic. He didn't believe in

19:59.060 --> 20:10.340
supernatural explanations. So I decided there that it would be logical for him,
through his powers of observation and deduction, to seek and find rational

20:10.340 --> 20:18.360
explanations to things that everyone else in the story thought were
supernatural, which was very reasonable 200 years ago. People were very ready to

20:18.360 --> 20:28.120
believe supernatural answers to most things. So that was the logic behind the
stories. There are three stories in the volume, "The Devil of Malkirk", "The

20:28.120 --> 20:38.340
Treasure of Odirex", and "The Lambeth Immortal". And they're extremely difficult to
categorize. Sheffield talks about them. They were published in different places,

20:38.340 --> 20:50.560
and it's an interesting point. The first one was published as a fantasy in
fantastic stories. The second one was published in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery

20:50.560 --> 21:05.660
Magazine. And the third one, in time I'm talking now, in data publication, was
published in fantasy and science fiction. Now, in practice, "The Devil of Malkirk"

21:05.660 --> 21:15.840
was the last one written. That's the first one in Erasmus Magister, but I wrote
that last. But I was not quite sure when I was writing them whether I was

21:15.840 --> 21:26.940
writing science fiction or fantasy or some type of historical detective. And I
finally decided it really didn't make any difference. I was trying to tell a

21:26.940 --> 21:37.460
story about what I consider to be a very interesting real person. And I tried to
get the facts about Erasmus Darwin accurate so that I was not doing any

21:37.460 --> 21:48.140
distortion to his beliefs and views or life history. But I permitted myself
license when it came to the things that happened to him. So it was an

21:48.140 --> 21:56.660
interesting, it was a very interesting set of stories to write. Sort of very
difficult to write, I don't know why. Perhaps because I was trying to put myself

21:56.660 --> 22:04.820
back in the 18th century framework. In each story, there is an apparently
supernatural happening or creature that puzzles or bedevils some part of

22:04.820 --> 22:12.040
England. The first story, "The Devil of Malkirk", for instance, deals with what we
today call the Loch Ness Monster. The stories are delightful reading. They're

22:12.040 --> 22:19.260
exciting, highly literate, and convincingly communicate the atmosphere of the
18th century English countryside. A reader of science fiction will find them to

22:19.260 --> 22:26.300
be different fare, certainly, but all the more enjoyable and refreshing because
they are. Sheffield says there will be more Erasmus Darwin stories, too, so keep

22:26.300 --> 22:30.320
an eye out for them. We'll finish our conversation with Charles Sheffield on our
next show.

22:37.660 --> 22:45.540
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:45.540 --> 22:46.300
Odessa, Texas.

23:38.280 --> 23:42.200
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:57.920 --> 24:03.260
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

24:06.060 --> 24:07.600
And here are your hosts.

24:11.740 --> 24:19.320
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. Though Charles Sheffield is noted as an
author of hard science fiction stories, he sometimes writes narratives which are

24:19.320 --> 24:26.900
fantastic or humorous. His stories on Erasmus Darwin, for example, are
illustrations of historical fantasy, but he's also done a series of stories that

24:26.900 --> 24:34.540
are pure humor. And at least once that humor had a larger purpose or message to
it. The story entitled The Man Who Stole the Moon, which appeared in the

24:34.540 --> 24:42.480
December 1980 edition of the science fiction paperback magazine Destinies, made
a serious comment on the United States space program. But it did so in a

24:42.480 --> 24:49.140
humorous way, with a clever twist in one of Robert Heinlein's classic short
stories, "The Man Who Stole the Moon". We asked Sheffield if he meant that story

24:49.140 --> 25:00.420
to have a strong message, and if he's had much reader response to it. It was
very much influenced by Heinlein's story, The Man Who Sold the Moon, and it was

25:00.420 --> 25:09.900
preaching a bit. And I think that's an example where you said there was a
message, and I say I was preaching. But I haven't really had any response. And

25:09.900 --> 25:21.560
I'm not quite sure what response I would expect for that. I think that most
people who read it and approve of it are already upset at the way we seem to be

25:21.560 --> 25:30.340
unable to have an effective space program. So the only sort of letters I might
think I would get would be people who would agree with it. The humorous series

25:30.340 --> 25:37.240
that he's done involves two bumbling lawyers named Henry Carver and Waldo
Burmeister. These stories seem to have no messages or preaching at all. They're

25:37.240 --> 25:45.740
pure farcical humor, cleverly done and chock full of puns. A couple of their
titles indicate their farcical nature. "The Dalmatian of Faust" and "Parasites

25:45.740 --> 26:00.380
Lost". Sheffield calls the stories his sewage series. We ask him why. Well,
because two of the first three involved...

26:00.380 --> 26:10.760
Well, let me put it differently. The first one of all was one involving the
Matin link, which was not particularly loathsome in any way. But then the next

26:10.760 --> 26:24.020
one was about one of the lawyers who was working in charge of the sewers on a
space station. That was "Dinsdale Dissents". Unduly falls into the sewer. Then

26:24.020 --> 26:37.520
another one, which is "The Dalmatian of Faust", the same individual again falls
into a different sewer. And generally speaking, I regard those stories as

26:37.520 --> 26:49.040
stories in which I take ideas that people have said are gross and unpleasant and
loathsome and disgusting and put them into stories. And one evening at dinner,

26:49.040 --> 26:57.280
we made a long list of things that people found generally distasteful. And the
suggestion was I should just write my way through the list until I got to the

26:57.280 --> 27:08.120
end. And I find that that's all right to a limited extent if you're writing what
you hope are humorous stories, like "Parasites Lost" is about a truffle pig. And

27:08.120 --> 27:22.280
"The Deimos Plague" is another in the series in which a man has to safeguard two
large pigs, taking them out to Mars. The stories generally are not intended to

27:22.280 --> 27:32.360
have any message, as you might say the man who stole the moon has, or any
redeeming features. I just write them because I find them amusing. It's very

27:32.360 --> 27:40.440
hard to tell whether readers find them amusing or not. We asked Sheffield if
he'll write any more of these humorous stories. Well, I have one that's sitting

27:40.440 --> 27:53.600
there somewhat. I've got about eight pages, and I stopped and did other things.
A story called "Space Opera", which involves the same characters, and what happens

27:53.600 --> 28:06.140
when this producer decides to stage a modern opera which has been written. It's
called Balaclava. And they decide to stage it in free fall with the charge of

28:06.140 --> 28:13.520
the Light Brigade and other complications. But I haven't written the rest of it
because I've been too busy writing other things. It's sitting there over on the

28:13.520 --> 28:23.060
desk there, and sometime I'll write it. But I write those occasionally with no
fixed timetable, just when I feel like it. Let's hope Charles Sheffield gets

28:23.060 --> 28:26.420
some more of these stories out. Humor and science fiction can be refreshing.

28:33.540 --> 28:41.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

28:41.420 --> 28:42.180
Odessa, Texas.
