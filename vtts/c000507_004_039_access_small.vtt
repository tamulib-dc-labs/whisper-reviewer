00:11.120 --> 00:18.240
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.240 --> 00:20.460
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.960
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.860 --> 00:35.940
The subject to this show is science fiction music, including that of science fiction motion

00:35.940 --> 00:37.300
pictures and other sources.

00:38.440 --> 00:43.220
The importance of music to movies, I think, is an obvious thing. A good musical score

00:43.220 --> 00:48.520
can do a number of things for a movie. It can create a mood for the entire picture. It

00:48.520 --> 00:53.440
can dramatize the actions of a particular scene. It can also rouse the emotions of the

00:53.440 --> 00:53.820
audience.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.920
With science fiction movies, I think this is true also, but with another dimension to

00:58.920 --> 01:04.140
it, the situations and moods of a science fiction movie might be of a very different

01:04.140 --> 01:12.560
nature. You might have, for instance, a meeting with a race of aliens, the awesomeness of

01:12.560 --> 01:17.940
a space battle, the discovery of a new planet, situations or moods that might take something

01:17.940 --> 01:22.740
a little different, a little special. I think it requires a special breed of composer to

01:22.740 --> 01:23.520
accomplish this.

01:24.640 --> 01:29.020
But the best science fiction music, I think, can evoke what good science fiction itself

01:29.020 --> 01:31.280
evokes, the sense of wonder and excitement.

03:00.180 --> 03:05.300
That was the main theme from Star Wars. Much of the music used in science fiction movies

03:05.300 --> 03:07.080
has its roots in classical music.

03:08.100 --> 03:14.380
One of the more popular and well-known works of this type is the Suite for Large Orchestra

03:14.380 --> 03:22.480
by Gustav Holst called The Planets. It was written between 1914 and 1918, and it contains

03:22.480 --> 03:27.080
a series of pieces on each planet that was known at that time, Mars through Neptune,

03:27.980 --> 03:30.760
and gives a musical impression of each one.

03:31.660 --> 03:36.220
During the filming of Star Wars, they used the music from Holst's The Planets to use

03:36.220 --> 03:40.680
as background music behind the scenes while they were being roughly edited together. They

03:40.680 --> 03:43.840
used this music in order to give the director and crew a sense of what the music was going

03:43.840 --> 03:48.220
to be like when the picture was completed. They liked the music so much that when they

03:48.220 --> 03:52.520
had the original score written, they had it written with the same type of orchestration

03:52.520 --> 03:54.700
and theme that was in The Planets.

03:55.940 --> 04:00.720
As an example now of what this is like, and maybe you can compare it to what the Star Wars

04:00.720 --> 04:06.840
theme was like, let's listen to Mars, the bringer of war, from Gustav Holst's The Planets.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.920
This is Bernard Ehrman conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

06:20.320 --> 06:27.020
Holst treated The Planets not in their astronomical aspect so much as in their astrological. Now

06:27.020 --> 06:32.980
the astrology isn't to be taken seriously. The titles would only indicate moods. They're

06:32.980 --> 06:38.200
more like tone poems that evoke particular moods. For instance, Mars, the bringer of

06:38.200 --> 06:45.420
war, evokes the mechanized horrors of modern warfare, since in its astrological aspect

06:45.420 --> 06:46.520
Mars is the god of war.

06:47.940 --> 06:53.980
Indeed as Harry Halbrach said, the planets belongs to our time as genuine space music.

06:55.320 --> 06:59.980
And of course who can forget the unique blend of classical music with science fiction and

07:00.760 --> 07:03.600
probably one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, 2001.

08:46.220 --> 08:51.420
Just as in Star Wars, the people producing 2001 used classical music behind their movies

08:51.420 --> 08:55.480
as they were editing it together. The difference here is being that they liked the music so

08:55.480 --> 08:56.660
much that they used it in the movie.

08:57.540 --> 09:02.960
And what they had to do was to junk an entire score that had been composed by Alex North.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.600
And it was not used in the movie because this classical background was so successful.

09:08.940 --> 09:13.380
The piece you just heard, which is probably the most famous theme from the movie 2001,

09:14.020 --> 09:19.440
is an actuality, a piece from a classical composition called Also Sprachsara Thustra,

09:19.840 --> 09:26.020
written by Richard Strauss in 1896. It's from a long tone poem. This is just the fanfare

09:26.020 --> 09:30.480
from that piece. Another piece used in the film was written by Richard's father, Johann,

09:30.930 --> 09:35.720
and it is one of the most famous of the Viennese waltzes, the Blue Danube, used in the incredible

09:35.720 --> 09:40.440
and unforgettable scene of the rocket ship approaching the space station in Earth orbit.

10:15.020 --> 10:20.500
As the 1950s began, we were treated to a number of low-budget science fiction films. One of

10:20.500 --> 10:25.480
them in particular, Rocket Ship XM, had music by a rather well-known classical composer,

10:25.480 --> 10:28.400
Fridae Groffet, the composer of the Grand Canyon Suite.

10:30.560 --> 10:36.540
Groffet was noted for his suites. He wrote many of them. His musical method was very simple.

10:37.700 --> 10:42.720
If you want to evoke the sound of a gun, you would fire a gun, which he did in one of his

10:42.720 --> 10:47.720
compositions. If you wanted the sound of a fire engine, you would record a fire engine. So his

10:47.720 --> 10:53.260
music is full of old typewriters clacking, earthquakes going off, foghorns bellowing,

10:53.260 --> 10:59.360
cable car bells ringing. That kind of simple basic method is particularly appropriate for

10:59.360 --> 11:02.360
the dramatic science fiction movie, which Rocket Ship XM was.

11:03.400 --> 11:09.400
In 1950, producer Robert Lippert decided to approach Groffet and try to get him to compose

11:09.400 --> 11:14.980
the music for the film. Groffet did not particularly want to be involved with low-budget science

11:14.980 --> 11:20.940
fiction films, which were not exactly considered the best by critics at that time. He agreed only

11:20.940 --> 11:25.840
to write the basic themes for the music. The actual composition of the orchestration was

11:25.840 --> 11:31.280
done by Albert Glasser. The following is a sampling of some of the pieces from Rocket Ship XM,

11:31.720 --> 11:34.560
including a solo by a unique instrument, the theremin.

14:20.940 --> 14:24.220
Rocket Ship XM is available on Starlog Records from Starlog Magazine.

14:25.520 --> 14:31.380
One of the most famous of the early Hollywood film composers is Bernard Ehrman. Ehrman is

14:31.380 --> 14:37.720
richly versed in classical music and his themes reflect that. He's mostly noted for his scores

14:37.720 --> 14:43.540
to Hitchcock movies such as North by Northwest and Psycho. We're going to play two selections written

14:43.540 --> 14:47.520
and conducted by Ehrman, journey to the center of the earth and the seventh voyage of Sinbad.

19:03.180 --> 19:08.300
One of the most noteworthy movies from the 50s was Forbidden Planet by Metro Goldenmayer.

19:09.440 --> 19:15.720
The music for that was extremely original. It was Electronic Tonalities composed by Lewis and

19:15.720 --> 19:21.380
Baby Barron. Electronic music was in its infancy and synthesizers had not even been invented.

19:21.980 --> 19:24.060
This is a brief excerpt from part of the soundtrack.

20:49.440 --> 20:55.420
Any contemporary moviegoer and anyone who has ears to hear is familiar with the work of John Williams.

20:56.400 --> 21:02.560
The composer's competence is attested to by the fact that he was recently made the conductor of

21:02.560 --> 21:10.340
the Boston Pops Orchestra, replacing Arthur Fiedler. He's done movies such as Jaws, Star Wars,

21:11.190 --> 21:17.100
Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman, The Empire Strikes Back.

21:18.060 --> 21:22.740
We'll start with the with the haunting Princess Leia's theme from Star Wars.

22:33.860 --> 22:34.380
The

22:34.380 --> 22:39.140
same year that Star Wars was completed, John Williams was also working on another movie.

22:39.140 --> 22:45.140
It was Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Actually, John wrote the music before the

22:45.140 --> 22:49.520
movie was completed and some of the scenes in the movie were matched to the music, which is usually

22:49.520 --> 22:54.780
the other way around. This is some of the most incredible music that John Williams has written.

22:55.340 --> 22:59.120
I don't think anything evokes the sense of wonder quite as much as when the

22:59.120 --> 23:02.200
first visitors appear to the earth people.

24:12.820 --> 24:19.500
Williams next did the music for the movie Superman. It was interesting in that movie he had the

24:19.500 --> 24:25.940
characters were identified by a particular mood, a particular kind of musical composition which

24:25.940 --> 24:31.680
identified their character. Lois Lane, for instance, was identified with a romantic ballad.

24:32.520 --> 24:38.480
Otis, the bumbling helper, had a comic flatulent march theme for a bassoon.

24:39.780 --> 24:45.380
Jor-El on the planet Krypton had a music which evoked a sense of mystic benevolence.

24:46.360 --> 24:51.960
But probably the best known compositions from the movie was the Fanfare, one of the

24:51.960 --> 24:54.140
heroic themes identified with Superman.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.060
We'll also play a short excerpt from the famous flying scene.

26:58.480 --> 27:03.400
John Williams, of course, also composed the score for the sequel to Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back.

27:04.500 --> 27:09.200
Another recent science fiction motion picture released in 1979 was Star Trek,

27:09.300 --> 27:14.300
the motion picture with music by Jerry Goldsmith. The film score was nominated for Academy Award

27:14.300 --> 27:18.700
and was well deserving of that and here is a selection from it called The Klingon Battle.

28:53.480 --> 28:58.060
Many of the most noted soundtracks released lately have been from science fiction movies and I believe

28:58.060 --> 29:01.200
that we can look forward to seeing much the same in the future.

29:08.920 --> 29:12.080
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

29:13.360 --> 29:18.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

29:18.740 --> 29:24.580
Association in conjunction with KOCV FM and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
