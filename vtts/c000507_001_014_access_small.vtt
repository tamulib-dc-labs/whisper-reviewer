Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.880 --> 00:34.200
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.500
And here are your hosts.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.160
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.160
Gregory Benford has emerged as one of the leading science fiction writers in recent

00:49.160 --> 00:53.940
years with such efforts as In the Ocean of Night and the multi-award-winning Timescape.

00:54.420 --> 00:58.560
And Benford's writing is characterized not only by the meticulous detail paid to scientific

00:58.560 --> 01:01.460
aspects but also by its elegant literary style.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.580
We ask him why he focuses on style.

01:38.880 --> 01:44.500
Being a professor of physics at the University of California, Irvine, Benford is not a full-time

01:44.500 --> 01:44.860
writer.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.100
In order to produce works of science fiction, he is forced to write when he can.

02:02.120 --> 02:05.420
It's not really left over because it's my weekends and evenings.

02:06.620 --> 02:07.820
How do I do it?

02:07.900 --> 02:08.720
Sometimes I wonder.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.120
The best answer is hurriedly.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.760
But in fact, I do work on my prose a great deal.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.460
I do many drafts of everything.

02:18.860 --> 02:22.880
I recently acquired a word processor to make this process simpler.

02:24.380 --> 02:30.100
But fundamentally, long ago I decided to practice time conservation wherever possible.

02:30.100 --> 02:34.400
The first rule of that is never do anything twice unless you enjoy it.

02:35.360 --> 02:45.600
So I try to never say have to redraft simple things like memos and always very selective

02:45.600 --> 02:47.080
about what I do with my time.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.360
But he views this dual role as an aid to his writing, not a hindrance.

02:52.220 --> 02:58.620
I draw a lot of my material that I write about from life, from observing people and so on.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.940
So I'm really doing two things at once.

03:01.020 --> 03:07.600
When I go to a scientific conference, I'm sopping up the material, but I'm also sopping up scientists

03:08.480 --> 03:11.040
watching the way people actually act.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.340
Every novelist does that.

03:13.700 --> 03:18.340
It's just that most novelists are full-time writers and therefore they don't get out and

03:18.340 --> 03:19.660
see the real world very much.

03:20.140 --> 03:25.680
I think that's the great liability of being a professional writer who only does that,

03:25.800 --> 03:27.160
is that you run out of material.

03:27.660 --> 03:35.020
And I think the 20th century is full of writers whose big problem is that they ran out of material.

03:36.340 --> 03:40.780
Even with his crowded schedule, Benford manages to squeeze in a little reading.

03:41.720 --> 03:48.220
I read when I can the best science fiction and the best in the mainstream.

03:48.700 --> 03:53.360
And also, for example, hardball detective stories and a lot of other things.

03:53.360 --> 03:59.280
Now I keep up on the prominent short story writers in America, for example.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.980
So I try to read eclectically.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.600
He acknowledges that his reading does influence his style to some extent, although he allows

04:08.600 --> 04:10.340
that his style changes from book to book.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.060
I don't really think that I've got a style.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.800
I certainly have some identifiable mannerisms.

04:17.180 --> 04:21.100
But it seems to me that every one of my books is written somewhat differently.

04:21.950 --> 04:27.720
And I do change style and approach fairly often.

04:28.940 --> 04:30.480
I may be wrong about that.

04:30.900 --> 04:34.460
Many people may think that there is a noticeable Benford style.

04:36.540 --> 04:43.280
But I don't think that I pick up those things from my reading directly, although certainly

04:43.280 --> 04:44.620
I'm influenced by a lot of writers.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.600
Every writer is influenced by people who came before.

04:47.600 --> 04:52.940
Otherwise we'd have to invent literature a whole each time we sat down to do a novel.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.900
More on Gregory Benford tomorrow.

05:03.140 --> 05:07.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:07.560 --> 05:11.760
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.380
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:16.400 --> 06:21.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.000
And here are your hosts.

06:30.580 --> 06:32.960
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

06:33.460 --> 06:37.800
In today's program we continue our discussion with science fiction author Gregory Benford.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.600
Benford has an interesting concept of how science fiction differs from mainstream literature.

06:44.480 --> 06:52.020
I think that mainstream and any genre like SF are in a sense two ends of a spectrum.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.300
And one blends into the other.

06:54.300 --> 07:03.900
There are obviously the books that only SF addicts will read and which are incomprehensible to ordinary readers.

07:04.400 --> 07:10.880
And that defines a boundary, but obviously it's a gradual transition from one to the other.

07:11.620 --> 07:20.040
Science is in SF not the really crucial dividing point.

07:20.040 --> 07:28.300
There are many things in science fiction which set it apart which are not connected with knowing a great deal of science,

07:28.400 --> 07:37.440
but rather with knowing a lot of accepted bits of jargon or common places we've assumed about the future,

07:37.720 --> 07:43.480
the way galactic empires are put together and so forth, usually very simple-mindedly in my estimation.

07:44.960 --> 07:53.180
And an ordinary reader coming to these things simply cannot understand them, therefore he rather usually quickly gives up.

07:55.080 --> 08:02.780
But therefore I think that it's the mannerisms of SF that tend to set it apart as much as anything else.

08:03.860 --> 08:08.340
Of course science fiction is concerned with content, a great deal more than other literature,

08:09.140 --> 08:11.700
and therefore that secures off people too.

08:13.740 --> 08:17.640
The novel Timescape took Benford a decade to conceive and to execute.

08:18.220 --> 08:22.360
Timescape has received accolades from those who do not ordinarily read science fiction.

08:22.900 --> 08:28.020
We ask Benford why such people are surprised when they read a science fiction work that is also good literature.

08:28.760 --> 08:35.440
Yes, I've gotten a fair number of letters and phone calls and so on from people who, quote,

08:35.600 --> 08:40.880
don't usually read science fiction, unquote, and are surprised to find that science fiction

08:40.880 --> 08:45.480
can actually have all the virtues of a regular novel and still be science fiction.

08:46.520 --> 08:49.240
Well, it's good that these people are catching on to that fact.

08:50.120 --> 08:54.160
Admittedly, the field has not given them a large number of examples to learn from,

08:54.160 --> 08:57.080
but I hope we will in future.

08:58.100 --> 09:03.200
Of course, the reason we haven't produced such books before is because it's damned hard.

09:03.920 --> 09:14.560
It's a lot of work and science fiction is typically not a field which rewards taking a decade to write a book.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.540
That's a sad fact, but it's true.

09:18.500 --> 09:23.820
Benford rewrote his first novel, Deeper Than the Darkness, and retitled it The Stars in Shroud.

09:24.420 --> 09:28.360
This was apparently motivated by his deep desire to produce well-written science fiction.

09:29.600 --> 09:35.160
I didn't want the old works to appear with my name on them when I could see that they were so deeply flawed,

09:35.540 --> 09:37.380
and I thought I could do a better job.

09:38.220 --> 09:45.880
I don't think I'm going to do that with any more of my books, but I certainly greatly revised a novel of mine.

09:45.880 --> 09:51.280
I sort of homaged to the Heinlein Juvenile called Jupiter Project.

09:51.840 --> 09:59.200
I revised that when it went into paperback, and I did that, as you said, with the Stars in Shroud.

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
Basically, I don't like to have less than my best in front of the public,

10:07.240 --> 10:14.580
and I care more about craftsmanship than I do about storing up my energies for the next project.

10:14.580 --> 10:22.920
I would prefer to salvage an old work and hammer away at a new one if I could be contented

10:22.920 --> 10:28.400
that at least I had never done anything I thought was really dreadful and allowed it to go out in public.

10:28.920 --> 10:35.900
A lot of writers don't feel this way, and I understand, particularly economically, why they would believe so.

10:36.460 --> 10:40.780
In our next show, we will discuss some details of Benford's novel, Times Gate.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

10:53.700 --> 10:56.600
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:42.020 --> 11:44.560
The next episode will be about the science fiction radio show,

11:44.560 --> 11:45.960
so stay with us.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.840
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.340
Gregory Benford's novel, Times Gate, was published in 1980 to great acclaim.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.480
The hardback edition has already become a collector's item.

12:26.140 --> 12:31.360
The novel has garnered many awards, including the Nebula and the John W. Campbell International Award.

12:31.980 --> 12:36.440
Benford was motivated to write it because he wanted to portray it realistically, a scientist at work.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.220
I took ten years to write Times Gate.

12:40.660 --> 12:46.880
It's written out of my experience as a graduate student at the University of California in the 1960s.

12:47.460 --> 12:59.000
Two-thirds of the book occurs in 1962 and 63, and I had always noticed that science fiction very seldom dealt with the life of a scientist

12:59.000 --> 13:03.160
as it is really lived, as I saw it.

13:04.660 --> 13:11.540
Benford woven to the matrix of a scientist at work, a unique twist on time travel stories, The Time Telegram.

13:12.560 --> 13:21.020
When I began to think about writing a book about time, a subject that had already and always fascinated me,

13:21.740 --> 13:24.880
and which science fiction had, it seemed to me, done to death,

13:25.580 --> 13:34.000
I began in fact to think about the way scientists would really try to attempt to transmit information across time.

13:34.340 --> 13:39.480
Not time travel, but simple time telegrams, if you will.

13:40.500 --> 13:45.000
And how would it happen? What would make people do it? How would it be received?

13:45.420 --> 13:47.240
What would scientists think about it?

13:47.240 --> 13:55.320
Because you see, the basic ingredient in the novel is to treat time communication like a new paradigm in science,

13:55.720 --> 14:01.600
so that you have scientists confronting something that's very unusual that they can't explain,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.600
that seems to not fit the standard way of doing science.

14:05.940 --> 14:11.120
After all, here's an experiment that's being interfered with and seems to be carrying a message. How bizarre.

14:12.460 --> 14:18.960
And so, this is like a scientist encountering a brand new scientific idea.

14:19.440 --> 14:29.700
So you get to see in a dramatic fashion how scientists deal with ambiguity and the unusual nature of their work,

14:29.960 --> 14:33.800
which does crop up now and then. After all, that's what scientific revolutions are about.

14:34.800 --> 14:40.000
About two-thirds of Timescape takes place in 1963, and the remainder in 1998.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.640
Minford chose those particular dates for a reason.

15:10.100 --> 15:16.920
There are a number of real-life people in Timescape. We asked Minford if he had to seek their permission to write them in the book.

15:17.520 --> 15:25.900
Well, the people who actually have walk-on speaking parts, who are identified as real people, I got the permission from,

15:26.520 --> 15:33.220
Freeman Dyson, particularly. People who were mentioned in passing, I didn't ask for permission because after all,

15:33.520 --> 15:37.920
they are people in the world and you can't refer to them. No one has a copyright on his name.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.460
Minford himself is a character in Timescape.

15:41.460 --> 15:50.400
There are some twins from Oklahoma who are not named in there, who are in fact myself and my twin brother.

15:52.080 --> 15:57.780
We asked Minford if while he was writing Timescape, he feared its style might prevent its becoming a commercial success.

15:59.520 --> 16:07.940
Definitely. But I decided what the hell I was going to write the book the way I wanted to, and I didn't care how it would do.

16:07.940 --> 16:15.260
In fact, when I finished the manuscript, I was pretty convinced that I would be able to sell it for only a minimal advance,

16:15.500 --> 16:21.180
and that would be just about it. I personally thought it was by far the best piece of writing I'd ever done,

16:21.560 --> 16:26.100
but that doesn't mean I thought it was going to be commercial. In fact, I didn't.

16:34.640 --> 16:40.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:40.860 --> 16:43.760
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
