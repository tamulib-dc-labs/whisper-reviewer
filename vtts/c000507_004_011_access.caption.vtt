Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:30.215 --> 00:37.345
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:38.489 --> 00:41.812
And here are your hosts.

00:44.776 --> 00:46.678
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:46.958 --> 00:53.705
Of all the themes handled by science fiction authors, that of alien contact has been one of the most consistently popular and fascinating.

00:53.965 --> 00:55.647
For a good reason, too.

00:55.667 --> 01:05.357
Aliens, whether they be the hostile bug-eyed monsters of the old pulp magazines or the friendly creatures of close encounters of the third kind, have always been one of the biggest attractions of science fiction.

01:05.590 --> 01:13.221
In the past, stories of alien contact were usually written as thrillers, with the sole and simple intention of scaring readers.

01:13.241 --> 01:13.522
H.G.

01:13.562 --> 01:17.968
Wells' The War of the Worlds is probably the best example of that type of story.

01:18.228 --> 01:19.871
But that's changed.

01:19.891 --> 01:27.582
Many contemporary writers have provided more thoughtful treatments of aliens, deepening the realism and the significance of narratives of alien contact.

01:35.915 --> 01:41.202
Of course, before you can have a story of alien contact, you have to have some aliens.

01:41.222 --> 01:49.193
One of the most provocative descriptions of aliens in all of science fiction is found in Larry Niven's and Jerry Pournelle's The Mote in God's Eye.

01:49.213 --> 01:56.102
The success of that book is largely due to the unique and ingenious aliens, the Moties, that Niven created for the story.

01:56.122 --> 02:02.591
It's interesting, though, that Niven says he doesn't really create aliens for a story, but suggests that it's the other way around.

02:03.672 --> 02:05.635
I always design alien stuff.

02:06.509 --> 02:24.543
There are two particularly fascinating things that Niven incorporated into these modis.

02:25.244 --> 02:27.488
One is the fact that they are not symmetrical.

02:27.603 --> 02:30.507
They have a head, torso, legs, and arms, as humans do.

02:30.948 --> 02:32.370
But the arms are disproportionate.

02:33.031 --> 02:35.294
One is small and thin, the other is large and powerful.

02:35.594 --> 02:35.875
Right.

02:36.235 --> 02:41.463
Niven says he took that idea from studying the structures of living creatures on Earth.

02:41.483 --> 02:50.195
In that case, I had the idea that I was following a progression with a protozoan, with an amoeba.

02:50.836 --> 02:53.880
You get radio symmetry inside and out.

02:55.295 --> 03:03.629
Move up a goodly distance and you find starfishes with radial symmetry on the outside and bilateral symmetry on the inside.

03:03.709 --> 03:09.098
Move up a little further, you find flatworms and worms of all stents.

03:10.701 --> 03:21.319
At the level of bilateral symmetry inside and out, go as far as a human and you find bilateral symmetry on the outside and no symmetry, well...

03:22.700 --> 03:25.124
Half symmetrical on the inside.

03:25.985 --> 03:27.287
The lungs look symmetrical.

03:27.347 --> 03:28.749
The kidneys look symmetrical.

03:28.809 --> 03:32.875
The intestines look like somebody dropped a plate of spaghetti.

03:33.476 --> 03:35.639
I tried to move on to the next step.

03:38.424 --> 03:41.969
Bilaterally unsymmetrical on the outside.

03:42.850 --> 03:46.716
And I got the original motive, which was the engineer for me.

03:51.674 --> 04:03.769
The other ingenious idea Niven developed for the Modis is the way they construct and use machines.

04:03.789 --> 04:10.117
They're highly skilled tool users, but they have no standard pre-manufactured machines, parts, or tools.

04:10.137 --> 04:14.622
They simply alter or reshape whatever they find around them at the time to suit their needs.

04:14.642 --> 04:17.626
Niven says that particular idea just came to him.

04:17.646 --> 04:19.909
It seemed interesting and even logical.

04:20.665 --> 04:25.830
I was just playing with ideas at that point, and that one seemed like a fun one.

04:26.511 --> 04:41.226
It also seemed likely enough if you've got a critter with not much intelligence except in the direction of tool making and tool altering, then why not?

04:41.246 --> 04:45.750
The thing has to keep testing its ability or it will lose it.

04:46.531 --> 04:48.293
It might as well be designing

04:48.492 --> 04:52.719
something every time it needs a specific machine.

04:52.739 --> 05:00.152
Besides the ingenuity Niven demonstrated in creating the Moties, he and Pournelle also weave some unexpected twists into the First Contact theme.

05:01.013 --> 05:13.875
A reader interested in aliens, or more specifically in First Contact, can't afford to overlook the Mote in God's Eye.

05:14.412 --> 05:23.393
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:05.020 --> 06:08.713
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:25.733 --> 06:31.602
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.289
And here are your hosts.

06:39.193 --> 06:41.596
This is Daryl Lane.

06:41.716 --> 06:42.517
And Bill Vernon.

06:43.218 --> 06:49.406
The so-called new wave in science fiction, which began in the mid-60s, was simply a new way of writing traditional science fiction.

06:49.426 --> 06:54.532
There were changes, for instance, in style, and characterization was given more emphasis.

06:54.552 --> 06:59.698
And the new wave treated themes, such as sex and religion, that science fiction hadn't really touched before.

06:59.830 --> 07:07.800
In general, the New Wave changed the stereotyped science fiction formulas that had been around since the pulp days of the 20s, 30s, and 40s.

07:07.820 --> 07:13.847
Frederick Pohl, who's been an author, an editor, and an agent in the field of science fiction, has something to say about that change.

07:15.209 --> 07:24.860
The New Wave was an attempt, I guess, 15 years ago or more, of a number of writers to break away from the traditional kinds of science fiction.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.383
In fact, most of them didn't want to call it science fiction anymore.

07:27.484 --> 07:29.466
They wanted to call it speculative fiction or...

07:30.256 --> 07:32.138
at nothing at all.

07:32.158 --> 07:44.932
And they were interested primarily in writing about inner space rather than outer space, and secondarily a lot of them in things like the drug culture and rock music and so on.

07:44.952 --> 07:55.103
But in the rather bitter internal struggle that went on in science fiction, a lot of people taking sides one way or the other.

07:55.123 --> 07:56.905
I think everyone was deeply affected.

08:06.470 --> 08:13.116
But we need to remember here that the New Wave wasn't really a planned and deliberate movement by a unified group of writers.

08:13.136 --> 08:21.344
One of the principal proponents of the New Wave, author Norman Spinrad, believes it was just a bunch of diverse writers doing their own thing.

08:21.364 --> 08:28.831
There was an old wave, but there was never, as a coherent philosophy in the school of science fiction, but there was never a New Wave in the same sense.

08:29.011 --> 08:30.172
There were a lot of waves.

08:30.192 --> 08:32.334
There were a lot of different people doing a lot of different things.

08:33.015 --> 08:36.358
The people that were identified as the New Wave were very diverse.

08:36.811 --> 08:38.273
what I was actually writing.

08:38.774 --> 08:45.884
It's very different to say what Tom Dish was writing or Ballard or Zelazny and Delaney were also identified as new wave writers.

08:47.326 --> 09:03.730
This stuff is much more, you know, Zelazny and Delaney and myself and Ballard and all this and Mike, we were all, there were more differences between our work than between our work taking its totality and the old stuff.

09:04.435 --> 09:08.801
There was more difference within the so-called new wave than there was within the so-called old wave.

09:09.983 --> 09:15.330
But Spinrad also thinks the new wave was tightly connected to what was happening in society.

09:15.350 --> 09:17.954
And, of course, this mirrored the cultural climate at the time.

09:18.014 --> 09:20.057
It mirrored what was happening politically.

09:20.157 --> 09:21.679
It mirrored what was happening in music.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.042
It mirrored what was happening in movies.

09:24.082 --> 09:28.789
It was a phenomenon that went through the Western civilization as a whole.

09:35.587 --> 09:38.230
There are those who say the new wave is dead.

09:38.250 --> 09:44.378
Five-time Hugo winner Larry Nivens says so, for instance, and offers a reason for his passing.

09:44.398 --> 09:53.510
The new wave is a very persuasive thing and very easy to use to justify bad stories.

09:53.530 --> 09:55.833
I think that's what killed it.

09:56.214 --> 10:05.526
Not that increased characterization and experiments with typography and story format

10:05.776 --> 10:11.565
are a bad thing in themselves, but it's so easy to use the new wave to justify a bad story.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.511
It was bound to collapse.

10:20.639 --> 10:22.643
The influence of the new wave is still around, though.

10:23.264 --> 10:24.686
It's left its mark on the field.

10:25.227 --> 10:29.073
Science fiction has been broadened, maybe enhanced somehow because of it.

10:29.093 --> 10:30.535
Frederik Pohl states it well.

10:31.932 --> 10:43.287
The New Wave, if nothing else, taught a bunch of old dinosaurs like Azimov and Heinlein and me that there were non-traditional ways of constructing a novel.

10:43.568 --> 10:52.300
You see, most of us had grown up when science fiction was in the pulp magazines, and most of it was written according to some variant of a pulp formula.

10:52.320 --> 10:58.248
Well, it turned out that wasn't necessary, and I think the New Wave is responsible for teaching us that.

11:03.607 --> 11:15.051
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:55.818 --> 12:10.452
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:10.472 --> 12:22.264
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:24.607 --> 12:25.989
And here are your hosts.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.859
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

12:33.159 --> 12:37.005
The award-winning novel Ringworld is probably Larry Niven's finest work.

12:37.025 --> 12:43.734
The Ringworld is an immense ring, large enough to hold three million Earths, and with a thousand-mile high wall to hold in its atmosphere.

12:44.275 --> 12:45.837
It also has continents and oceans.

12:46.378 --> 12:51.846
The Ringworld contains trillions of inhabitants of different species and derives energy from the sun at its center.

12:52.231 --> 12:56.717
Niven recalls where he obtained the idea for such a fantastic structure.

12:56.737 --> 13:00.381
I ran across the concept Dyson sphere.

13:01.603 --> 13:12.937
Dyson, the mathematician, came up with the concept Dyson shell, and he was misunderstood to some extent, so presently I ran across an article about Dyson spheres.

13:13.378 --> 13:21.208
Picture that as a golf ball 93 million miles in radius with a sun at the center, and

13:21.610 --> 13:39.568
gravity generators all around the outside so you would live on the inside terraform it with oceans and soil and air I ran across that and I didn't like it I thought it could be improved and I wound up with the Ringworld

13:47.041 --> 13:52.808
Readers studied the science behind the Ringworld and wrote Niven about seeming inconsistencies in the design of the immense artifact.

13:53.970 --> 13:59.417
Call them errors and elaborations because some of them don't really fit the error thing.

13:59.537 --> 14:02.641
It's just something that hadn't gotten into the original book.

14:03.682 --> 14:06.085
One of the errors was spotted by some MIT students.

14:06.486 --> 14:08.468
It had to do with the instability of the Ringworld.

14:09.469 --> 14:13.795
I suspected the Ringworld was unstable, and I suspected you'd eat at it, Jed.

14:14.516 --> 14:14.736
I...

14:15.087 --> 14:24.101
was sure that the Ringworld was spinning fast enough to permit bizarre dramjets to be used as attitude jets, which means you don't have a fuel problem at all.

14:24.121 --> 14:25.403
You're burning the solar wind.

14:26.545 --> 14:36.281
But rapidly, some MIT people demonstrated that the Ringworld was unstable, and they were chanting it in the halls at the next world gone.

14:36.441 --> 14:37.963
The Ringworld is unstable.

14:38.144 --> 14:42.090
The Ringworld is unstable.

14:42.695 --> 14:48.665
It still took about seven years for anyone to figure out the exact numbers for the instability.

14:48.945 --> 14:50.127
And they are horrifying.

14:50.167 --> 14:59.782
The Ringworld, a major solar flare would have the Ringworld grinding against its sun in five years.

14:59.802 --> 15:01.105
Well, I worked it into the plot.

15:01.766 --> 15:04.670
That was one elaboration or error.

15:05.812 --> 15:09.478
Even teenage readers analyzed his Ringworld with a critical scientific eye.

15:10.302 --> 15:22.309
A high school class in Florida got to work on the Ringworld, and their conclusion was that the Ringworld's worst problem is that all the topsoil would wind up in the oceans in about 3,000 years.

15:23.111 --> 15:27.501
There are no earthquakes on the Ringworld, no mountain-building forces.

15:35.227 --> 15:40.514
But in a sequel, Ringworld Engineers, Niven attempted to correct such deficiencies.

15:40.534 --> 15:44.839
He devised a way to answer the criticism of the Florida high schoolers.

15:44.859 --> 15:47.442
Okay, that's a tough one.

15:47.523 --> 15:58.456
I set up a spill pipe system that runs the top, that runs the sea bottom muck from the sea bottoms under the Ringworld and up over the edge of the rim wall.

16:00.599 --> 16:02.922
That even allows you some...

16:04.218 --> 16:10.045
some mind's accumulation of useful metals.

16:20.759 --> 16:31.052
Fan response of that sort caused Ringworld engineers to be written, and although Niven once said he wouldn't write anymore in the known space series, the body of stories to which Ringworld belongs, he's not so sure anymore.

16:32.433 --> 16:37.743
I've given up saying that the known space series is dead.

16:38.605 --> 16:39.887
There's just no point in it.

16:39.967 --> 16:44.556
I've written five books worth of known space stories since I said that.

16:45.238 --> 16:53.293
More on Larry Niven tomorrow.

16:53.847 --> 17:02.676
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:41.992 --> 18:02.436
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:02.456 --> 18:08.303
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:10.645 --> 18:12.007
And here are your hosts.

18:17.015 --> 18:18.096
This is Daryl Lane.

18:18.116 --> 18:18.937
And David Carson.

18:19.258 --> 18:22.222
Larry Niven is one of the best-selling authors in the field of science fiction.

18:22.583 --> 18:29.213
A fairly large portion of his work falls into the known space series, a group of stories and novels with a consistent chronology.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.957
Such a series is called a future history.

18:31.977 --> 18:36.223
Niven believes there are some peculiar attractions a future history has for a science fiction author.

18:37.285 --> 18:39.268
There had been future histories around.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.565
Poul Anderson's and Robert Heinlein.

18:45.087 --> 18:52.118
And I tell you, I guess we each evolve the idea somewhat independently.

18:52.158 --> 19:01.031
And the idea is that if you carved out a consistent, workable future, it seems a shame to waste it on one story.

19:02.593 --> 19:09.323
You put in the background because you want the background of a story to seem

19:09.843 --> 19:11.144
bigger than it is.

19:11.164 --> 19:15.007
So there are things that are simply unexplained.

19:15.027 --> 19:19.651
And if you think of more to say on a given subject, why you go with it.

19:19.911 --> 19:29.139
And if you think of a story that fits into the background of a previous story and allows you to elaborate on that background, sometimes you fall in love with the background.

19:29.800 --> 19:39.748
And presently, you've got a bunch of stories that link.

19:44.082 --> 19:47.828
Niven has also written some best-selling books that fall outside his known space series.

19:48.428 --> 19:54.858
Three of these, The Mote in God's Eye, Lucifer's Hammer, and Oath of Fealty, were written in collaboration with Jerry Pournelle.

19:55.359 --> 19:57.402
We asked Niven how he and Purnell collaborate.

19:58.463 --> 20:02.229
Hard sometimes, but it always resolves.

20:02.790 --> 20:10.381
The question is who is most qualified to write a given scene that we have both decided needs writing.

20:10.401 --> 20:13.245
Before we start, we have the novel all laid out.

20:13.816 --> 20:17.280
we know what's going in virtually everywhere.

20:17.461 --> 20:19.363
And if we don't, it feels like we do.

20:20.685 --> 20:25.511
And if we find out we don't, we elaborate as we get to that section.

20:25.531 --> 20:28.755
Okay, the next question is, who is qualified to write a given scene?

20:28.935 --> 20:31.078
Sometimes it's obvious.

20:31.098 --> 20:34.002
If we're dealing with a madman, he's mine.

20:34.022 --> 20:37.887
If we're dealing with military operations, it's Jerry's.

20:37.907 --> 20:39.729
Aliens are generally mine.

20:40.810 --> 20:42.793
Politics is generally Jerry's.

20:44.039 --> 21:12.088
knowledge of history generally Jerry's and a real evil son of a bitch Jerry usually creates him and I usually run with him afterward Niven occasionally writes science fiction humor a rarity he talks about his most successful piece of humor I suppose I could name

21:13.418 --> 21:19.144
Oh, Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex, which has gotten me the most laughs, I suppose.

21:20.325 --> 21:24.490
Everybody seems to have read it, and those who haven't have heard about it at a cocktail party.

21:25.831 --> 21:34.781
Niven's ready eye for humor can also be appreciated, as he reveals that he's detected one of his own alien creations from Ringworld, a Pearson's puppeteer, here on Earth.

21:36.182 --> 21:39.966
I have reason to suspect that there are puppeteers on Earth.

21:40.469 --> 21:41.750
Look at their characteristics.

21:42.311 --> 21:43.071
Forget the shape.

21:43.131 --> 21:47.756
They must be masters of biology to hide that peculiar three-legged, two-headed shape.

21:48.436 --> 21:50.518
But consider their characteristics.

21:50.578 --> 21:51.459
They are cowards.

21:53.441 --> 21:55.683
That is, they want everything utterly safe.

21:56.564 --> 21:57.985
No corners on anything.

21:58.105 --> 22:00.947
Everything is soft surfaces around the puppeteer world.

22:02.068 --> 22:09.295
They don't even keep their world near a sun, regarding it as a runaway fusion reactor, which, of course, it is.

22:10.523 --> 22:19.495
So, desperate regard for safety, plus an urge to meddle in the lifestyles of other species.

22:20.857 --> 22:27.206
Driving urge to meddle with practically no restraints attached.

22:27.226 --> 22:28.648
What does that remind you of?

22:28.668 --> 22:39.282
It seems nearly certain to me that Ralph Nader is a Pearson Spoke McKeer.

22:39.785 --> 22:48.529
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:50.011 --> 23:13.521
Thank you.

23:30.764 --> 23:51.158
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:51.178 --> 23:57.548
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:59.198 --> 24:00.560
And here are your hosts.

24:05.385 --> 24:07.367
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

24:07.608 --> 24:17.219
Ever since Hugo Gernsback published the first science fiction magazine in 1926, Amazing Stories, science fiction has been separated from other kinds of literature.

24:17.239 --> 24:20.923
And many people, both fans and authors, have been satisfied with that separation.

24:21.644 --> 24:25.088
They like the special feeling of belonging to something distinct and even unique.

24:26.030 --> 24:38.553
But others feel that the separation of science fiction from general literature, sometimes referred to as mainstream literature, is artificial and even harms science fiction because it keeps it a second-class genre that's not treated seriously.

24:39.234 --> 24:47.329
We spoke with Dr. Kirpal Singh, science fiction scholar and critic, at the 1981 World Science Fiction Convention in Denver on this subject.

24:47.309 --> 24:51.745
Dr. Singh teaches science fiction at the National University of Singapore.

24:51.765 --> 24:56.442
He has some strong ideas on science fiction and its relationship to mainstream literature.

24:57.367 --> 25:04.076
I think ultimately the distinctions ought to disappear, frankly.

25:04.216 --> 25:11.606
Because the more we try to erect these boundaries, the more we get into troubled waters.

25:11.946 --> 25:16.613
Because as we all know, categories are by their very nature exclusive.

25:17.354 --> 25:25.264
And when they become too exclusive, as I think the case has been with science fiction for a long time, what develops is the hiatus.

25:25.784 --> 25:28.116
and that could lead to a breakdown in communication.

25:28.433 --> 25:29.755
rather than an integration.

25:30.316 --> 25:57.175
And I think one of the reasons why perhaps science fiction has not quite enjoyed the kind of status that it ought to as a valid and viable form of literature in our time is the fact that too often and by too many people it has been very zealously and jealously guarded as something exclusive, something that one entered with a great deal of trepidation, things like that.

25:57.155 --> 26:01.623
Yes, I think ultimately there has to be an elimination of the categories.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.087
As Brian Aldiss says, science fiction is literature.

26:05.209 --> 26:10.117
Some of Dr. Singh's ideas on why science fiction has been kept separate are probably a bit controversial.

26:10.418 --> 26:15.687
We asked him, for instance, if readers or fans of science fiction are partly responsible for its isolation.

26:16.628 --> 26:23.984
Yes, I think fans to a large extent explain the exclusiveness as we are witnessing in this whole convention here in Denver itself.

26:25.548 --> 26:33.726
One of the things that I notice most readily is the fact that a lot of the fans are not really, I think, very keen on a serious discussion of science fiction.

26:34.128 --> 26:37.255
They're here to have a good time, and that's a very good thing in itself.

26:37.355 --> 26:38.919
I mean, I think people ought to have a good time.

26:39.560 --> 26:47.057
But at the same time, they mustn't then go on and complain that, oh, you know, we are regarded as freaks, as people on our own individual trips.

26:47.138 --> 26:53.031
Because I think in some ways, we SF enthusiasts invite that kind of charge or accusation.

26:53.720 --> 26:57.545
I also feel that a lot of the science fiction writers are themselves responsible for this.

26:58.947 --> 27:06.417
I've talked personally with a number of them and I've heard many of them speaking and I've read what they have said in fanzines and things.

27:06.917 --> 27:15.829
They do want to keep this kind of thing going because the science fiction writers feel that they are commercially viable only in so far as they have got a large fan following.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.416
And if they have a large fan following, then they feel that they can sell.

27:20.237 --> 27:31.033
Now, the same writers also lament the fact that serious critics at the universities, in colleges and all, are not taking them seriously.

27:31.053 --> 27:36.641
But I want to question that because to a large extent, I think it's part of their own making.

27:36.661 --> 27:40.467
And they don't put enough effort and serious struggle into the work.

27:40.487 --> 27:44.112
And therefore, the outcome of it is quite mediocre, to say the least.

27:45.020 --> 27:46.862
Does he think science fiction should change?

27:48.142 --> 27:52.286
Yes, I mean, you know, and this is why so much of science fiction becomes obsolete.

27:53.207 --> 28:08.401
There's too much attention, too much ostentatious attention paid to scientific detail, scientific accuracy, new technological breakthroughs and things, so that the imagination, I think, is sapped up by the facts rather than fiction.

28:08.521 --> 28:12.024
So that what happens in science fiction is that science takes over the fiction.

28:12.044 --> 28:15.347
And to be established as literature, I think it's the fiction that needs to prevail.

28:16.390 --> 28:20.296
Controversial ideas, certainly, but also thought-provoking ones.

28:28.447 --> 28:37.200
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
