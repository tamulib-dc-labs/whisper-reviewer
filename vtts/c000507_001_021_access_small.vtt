Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.020 --> 00:34.320
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.620
And here are your hosts.

00:42.780 --> 00:43.920
This is Daryl Lane.

00:44.160 --> 00:44.820
And David Carson.

00:45.320 --> 00:49.000
Ray Bradbury is a name familiar not to just readers of science fiction or fantasy, but

00:49.000 --> 00:50.760
to almost any literate American or European.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.800
Some of Bradbury's work, like the Martian Chronicles or Fahrenheit 451, are classics

00:55.800 --> 00:58.240
that are admired by readers of all kinds and of all tastes.

00:58.720 --> 01:03.700
He does indeed write science fiction, and fantasy, and horror, and weird stories, but

01:03.700 --> 01:06.820
they're all done with a style and emotional texture that is unique to Bradbury.

01:07.480 --> 01:11.760
Bradbury wrote from a very early age, as far back as his grammar school days in the Midwest.

01:12.320 --> 01:16.180
But it wasn't until he was 19 and living in Los Angeles that he got the push that helped

01:16.180 --> 01:16.820
him to get published.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.720
He tells us about a group of science fiction writers in Los Angeles that gave him that

01:20.720 --> 01:21.000
push.

01:22.180 --> 01:26.900
Bruce Yerke, who was the secretary for the Science Fantasy Society, wrote me a letter

01:26.900 --> 01:28.840
in October of 1937.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.020
That was my last year in high school.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.500
They invited me to come down to Clifton's cafeteria and meet the group.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.500
And I was very shy and a little fearful.

01:39.660 --> 01:40.500
I didn't know anyone.

01:41.120 --> 01:46.580
But nevertheless, I got my courage together and went down to a meeting.

01:47.220 --> 01:52.460
And that was my first encounter with Forrest Ackerman, who became my first editor.

01:52.740 --> 01:55.280
He was editing a magazine called Imagination.

01:55.280 --> 02:01.900
And then along over the next year or so, I met Henry Kupner, Arthur Barnes, Lee Brackett,

02:02.040 --> 02:06.560
Robert Heinlein, Jack Williamson, Ross Rockland, Henry Hasse.

02:07.340 --> 02:08.900
They all became friends.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.320
And in one way or another, influenced me.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.920
We were very close.

02:14.260 --> 02:19.360
And I was beginning to write a lot of very bad science fiction, very bad fantasy.

02:19.580 --> 02:21.040
I still haven't learned to write well.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.960
But these people were very patient with me.

02:23.960 --> 02:32.480
And especially, I remember Robert Heinlein and his wonderful wife, who invited me up

02:32.480 --> 02:33.740
to their home on occasion.

02:34.260 --> 02:39.100
I got to read a lot of his manuscripts before they were published.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.360
He was just starting to write.

02:41.120 --> 02:50.780
He came to a meeting at the Science Fantasy Club in, I believe it was 19, early 30, 38

02:50.780 --> 02:51.520
or 39.

02:52.120 --> 02:56.220
He had just written his first story and sold it to a stunning science fiction.

02:56.740 --> 03:00.940
So he was a beginner, just as I was, except he was about 11 years older.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
He was around, I would say, 31.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.160
And I think I was 19 when I met him.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.820
So it was that kind of situation where you had personal contact with writers who were

03:12.820 --> 03:15.600
already established or were establishing themselves.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.380
And of course, it changed my life forever because I had acceptance.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.800
People were willing to put up with me and read my terrible stories.

03:26.660 --> 03:30.220
Though Bradbury did get encouragement from these other writers, his fiction has always

03:30.220 --> 03:31.240
been uniquely his own.

03:31.780 --> 03:34.280
We asked him if it would be fair to call him a self-taught writer.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.680
Well, I guess you can say that.

03:37.780 --> 03:41.140
Most writing, almost every art form, is self-teaching.

03:41.560 --> 03:45.120
Except what you need around the edges is shortcut.

03:45.120 --> 03:52.400
If people can help you by recommending certain books, either books on writing or books which

03:52.400 --> 03:55.520
give you examples of excellent writing.

03:55.740 --> 04:00.720
I remember Henry Kutner was always calling Lee Brackett up or calling me up and saying,

04:00.800 --> 04:02.440
hey, have you read Captain Adam Porter?

04:02.900 --> 04:04.620
Do you know the work of John Collier?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.680
What about Yudor O'Welty?

04:06.840 --> 04:13.200
Well, this kind of shortcut is so important that you break away from your own field and

04:13.200 --> 04:18.960
move on out into the wide culture and bring back into the science fiction and the fantasy

04:18.960 --> 04:25.560
field influences from people like Kipling or Somerset Mom or John Collier.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.640
So that's where having a good teacher is important.

04:31.520 --> 04:37.320
Not that they teach you all that much or that intensely, but the fact that they care about

04:37.320 --> 04:43.760
you at all is very good for your sense of malnutrition.

04:44.120 --> 04:48.880
We all feel as if we haven't set ourselves well enough from here at that age.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.220
We'll continue our conversation with Ray Bradbury next time.

05:01.020 --> 05:05.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:05.160 --> 05:09.360
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.660 --> 06:17.800
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.160
And here are your hosts.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.660
This is David Carson.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.600
And Darrell Lane.

06:28.900 --> 06:32.360
Ray Bradbury is an internationally known author who's managed to attract readers outside

06:32.360 --> 06:34.080
the field of science fiction and fantasy.

06:34.080 --> 06:38.100
In fact, he's one of the few writers of science fiction and fantasy whose name is almost instantly

06:38.100 --> 06:39.640
recognizable outside the field.

06:40.180 --> 06:43.900
He's also written so-called mainstream, or regular fiction ever since he began publishing

06:43.900 --> 06:45.640
early in the 1940s.

06:45.760 --> 06:50.080
Dan DeLion Wine, a poetic novel about a boy growing up in a small Midwestern town, is

06:50.080 --> 06:51.880
one example of his non-science fiction output.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.920
We asked him how he broke out of the restricted field of science fiction and gained such widespread

06:55.920 --> 06:59.000
acceptance for all of his fiction with all types of readers.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.860
Well, you just automatically think about it for a lifetime.

07:04.200 --> 07:11.260
I always dreamt of being, number one, a writer, not a writer of science fiction or a writer

07:11.260 --> 07:12.920
of fantasy, but a writer period.

07:13.120 --> 07:19.740
I had huge heroes that I looked up to in the world, people like Shakespeare and a lot of

07:19.740 --> 07:24.060
the great poets, Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost when I was in 19th.

07:24.580 --> 07:29.900
And then as I got older and began to see the world of the theater around me more, I wanted

07:29.900 --> 07:31.100
to do theater work.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.060
I loved motion pictures.

07:33.380 --> 07:35.840
I knew that eventually I wanted to do some films.

07:36.360 --> 07:41.280
So my interests were always very Catholic, very broad, and it was only a matter of time

07:41.280 --> 07:43.740
before I would experiment with each of these things.

07:44.200 --> 07:50.600
And at the same time I was writing and having my first success in selling stories to Weirdtales,

07:50.960 --> 07:57.760
I was beginning to write short stories in the larger fields, stories about racial relationships

07:57.760 --> 08:01.080
or stories about travel inside America.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.560
A little bit of everything I was experimenting with.

08:05.380 --> 08:09.140
Bradbury said he was about 25 when he first began publishing stories that were not science

08:09.140 --> 08:09.960
fiction or fantasy.

08:10.880 --> 08:16.740
A friend of mine called me on the phone and said he was going to Mexico to travel for

08:16.740 --> 08:17.360
two months.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.640
Did I want to come along?

08:18.640 --> 08:20.220
Well, I said I can't.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.020
I don't have any money.

08:21.240 --> 08:26.380
I was still only making around $20 a week selling stories to Weirdtales.

08:26.760 --> 08:33.600
I usually sold six stories to Weirdtales every year, which gave me around $120 for the whole

08:33.600 --> 08:33.920
year.

08:34.560 --> 08:38.800
And then I sold an occasional murder mystery and a few science fiction stories.

08:38.900 --> 08:43.820
So my income at the time was around $2,500 a year if I was lucky.

08:44.780 --> 08:47.040
And he said, oh, you're such a coward.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.120
He said, here the war is over.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.260
War has been over in Europe a month or so.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.460
You should travel and you're afraid to send out your short stories.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.660
You're afraid of being rejected.

08:59.280 --> 09:06.500
I know you've got a lot of excellent broad literary middle stream fictions.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.860
I'm not sure we type them and send them out.

09:09.140 --> 09:13.280
So by God, he egged me on and I got three short stories out of my files.

09:13.780 --> 09:17.120
I re-typed them, put an assumed name on each one, William Elliott.

09:17.760 --> 09:23.840
I mailed them off without an agent, without any representation, with not even a letter

09:24.760 --> 09:26.320
from myself to the editors.

09:26.760 --> 09:31.780
And one story to Charm, one story to Mademoiselle, and another one to Collier's.

09:32.620 --> 09:36.280
Bradbury got a big surprise and a big paycheck after sending those three stories in.

09:37.180 --> 09:40.280
Well, all three stories sold within three days of each other.

09:40.760 --> 09:48.220
One story sold on August 19th to Charm, on the 20th, one to Mademoiselle, and on my birthday,

09:48.220 --> 09:52.140
the 22nd of August, I sold my first short story to Collier's.

09:52.440 --> 09:57.500
So all of a sudden, I had an aggregate of $1,000 which arrived in the mail.

09:57.980 --> 10:06.260
Well, $1,000 back in 1945 would be like getting $15,000 in the mail today.

10:06.580 --> 10:07.880
I was out of my head.

10:07.940 --> 10:08.720
I couldn't believe it.

10:09.120 --> 10:14.360
So without money, I picked up and went to Mexico with him for six weeks, where I had

10:14.360 --> 10:19.120
a whole series of adventures that scared the hell out of me and caused me to write some

10:19.120 --> 10:21.740
of my best weird stories when I came home.

10:22.320 --> 10:27.400
So that's the way I made the transition, because someone called me a coward and dared me to

10:27.400 --> 10:28.480
send my stories out.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.700
On our next show, we'll have more with Ray Bradbury.

10:39.340 --> 10:43.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

10:43.740 --> 10:47.940
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.440
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.800
So stay with us.

11:55.740 --> 12:00.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:03.540 --> 12:04.980
And here are your hosts.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.420
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

12:11.740 --> 12:15.260
Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is one of the best known science fiction books produced

12:15.260 --> 12:15.920
in this country.

12:16.500 --> 12:20.660
It's poetic style, it's treatment of mankind's present problems, and its vision of man's

12:20.660 --> 12:24.120
future make it a book admired not only by regular readers of science fiction, but by

12:24.120 --> 12:25.000
anyone who reads it all.

12:25.480 --> 12:29.160
The book is really a collection of related short stories concerning man's colonization

12:29.160 --> 12:29.680
of Mars.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.320
We asked Bradbury if he wrote each story with the entire volume in mind.

13:02.860 --> 13:09.480
Well, I had meetings with various people at Simon & Schuster and Doubleday, and they

13:09.480 --> 13:13.060
all said, look, we don't publish short stories, nobody buys them, nobody cares.

13:13.740 --> 13:19.400
And then one night I had dinner with Walter Bradbury at Doubleday, no relation to me,

13:19.980 --> 13:25.280
a wonderful gentleman, very bright gentleman, and sitting there at dinner that night he

13:25.280 --> 13:27.200
said, Ray, what about all those Martian stories?

13:27.200 --> 13:28.960
Isn't there a novel there?

13:29.060 --> 13:31.680
Isn't there some way of hanging them all together?

13:31.900 --> 13:33.500
It seems to me there's a common thread.

13:33.900 --> 13:40.660
I said, oh my God, you know, years ago I made notes about doing a series of chronicles,

13:40.740 --> 13:43.220
and then threw the notes somewhere and forgot about them.

13:43.480 --> 13:48.820
So my subconscious must have remembered, and along through the years was putting these

13:48.820 --> 13:50.280
beads on a single thread.

13:50.720 --> 13:57.100
I went back to the YMCA that night, sat in my underwear, it was a hot, hot summer evening

13:57.100 --> 14:02.520
terribly humid, and finished typing out an outline of a book which I called The Martian

14:02.520 --> 14:07.980
Chronicles, which I then took to Doubleday the next day, and they promptly bought the

14:07.980 --> 14:11.260
novel, plus the illustrated man, a collection of stories.

14:11.940 --> 14:18.720
And I left New York City with, again, a fabulous $1,000, $500 for each book.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.380
The stories are not scientifically accurate.

14:21.800 --> 14:25.360
Man can breathe the Martian atmosphere unaided, for example, but they're not meant to be.

14:25.360 --> 14:29.520
They have to be read symbolically, at a deep unconscious level which is triggered by

14:29.520 --> 14:30.860
Bradbury's poetic way of writing.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.460
There is an order to the 26 stories that make up The Martian Chronicles.

14:34.940 --> 14:39.220
The final one is entitled The Million-Year Picnic, and we ask Bradbury why he put that one last.

14:40.060 --> 14:41.860
It seemed a proper place to put it.

14:42.920 --> 14:49.740
It seemed a culmination of all the stories, and that my job in looking at all my stories

14:49.740 --> 14:54.280
was to guess where to place each, and well, some of them it was very easy.

14:54.280 --> 14:59.300
I did a whole series of stories of first encounters on Mars with various expeditions.

14:59.640 --> 15:05.460
So I knew those automatically had to be up front, along with an imaginary encounter in

15:05.460 --> 15:09.120
Illa, where a woman dreams an invasion of Mars.

15:09.640 --> 15:15.140
We never see the invasion itself of the Earthmen, but we know that secretly it must be there

15:15.140 --> 15:18.140
somewhere, and the real people got killed by the jealous husband.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.860
And then you go along through all the other encounters, and what happens to Mars as a result,

15:23.860 --> 15:32.700
of the invasion by Earth people, and ending with all of your final beats, and a brief return to Earth

15:32.700 --> 15:37.520
for there will come soft rains, and then The Million-Year Picnic at the end.

15:37.620 --> 15:44.180
It all stalled together in roughly two hours in my head at the typewriter that night at the YMCA.

15:45.420 --> 15:49.980
In 1980, NBC produced a major six-hour dramatization of The Martian Chronicles.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.060
We asked Bradbury if he was happy with it.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.980
I most certainly was not.

15:55.460 --> 16:00.980
It was one of the most boring shows ever put on television, and it's a great shame.

16:01.240 --> 16:07.960
Obviously no one enjoyed doing it, and the director obviously didn't enjoy it, which is a great shame,

16:08.100 --> 16:13.060
because he should have got out of bed every morning and said, let's have a ball, let's play,

16:13.700 --> 16:19.920
let's jump up and down and scream and yell and get something out of this material, but he obviously didn't do that.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.740
We'll have more for you, Bradbury, on our next show.

16:29.940 --> 16:35.340
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:35.340 --> 16:38.500
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.860
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:43.480 --> 17:48.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.060
And here are your hosts.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.300
This is Daryl A.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.280
And David Carson.

17:59.740 --> 18:04.500
Ray Bradbury's 1962 novel, Something Wicked This Way Comes, is a classic of fantasy and horror.

18:04.980 --> 18:10.580
It's about a carnival that comes to a small Midwestern town, a carnival with evil secrets beneath its colorful exterior,

18:11.040 --> 18:12.800
and about two boys who discover the evil.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.100
We asked Bradbury if there was a particular impetus behind the story.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.200
Not really. It all started a long time ago.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.740
I wrote a short story for weird tales called The Black Ferris.

18:24.000 --> 18:31.760
And I've always been in love with carnivals and circuses and illustrated men and wars and picnics and you name it.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.480
So over the years all this material accumulated.

18:35.720 --> 18:42.180
And one night about 24 years ago, Gene Kelly invited me over to MGM Studios here

18:42.180 --> 18:45.280
to see a new film of his called Invitation to the Dance.

18:45.440 --> 18:52.900
And part of that film is a sort of dance ballet concerned with a clown, a carnival,

18:53.360 --> 18:59.080
sort of material that Lon Cheney Sr. once did 60 years ago in American films.

18:59.240 --> 19:07.180
He did a lot of films about circuses and armless, legless performers,

19:07.180 --> 19:12.760
all kinds of grotesques that he worked with and pretended to imitate.

19:13.420 --> 19:18.860
So I came out of the screening of Gene Kelly's film and walked home with my wife,

19:19.580 --> 19:24.360
lamenting all the way the fact that I'd never worked for Kelly and wanting very much to do so.

19:24.940 --> 19:30.360
So I got home and I rummaged through all my material to find something to send to Gene Kelly.

19:30.360 --> 19:41.520
And I found the black ferris and I took several weeks to write it into a longer 70 page screen adaptation treatment outline.

19:41.960 --> 19:47.040
And I took it to Kelly and he immediately said, my God, I must direct this.

19:47.500 --> 19:51.100
Can I have an option on it? I'll take it to Europe and try to get some money.

19:51.640 --> 19:56.400
He went to Europe for a number of weeks and months and finally returned and said, it's no use.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.500
Nobody wants to put up any money for this.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.060
Thanks very much and so long.

20:01.700 --> 20:06.260
Well, I was heartbroken because I wanted to work for Kelly and I sat the heck with it.

20:06.600 --> 20:11.100
I sat down and I wrote the long screen treatment into a novel.

20:11.300 --> 20:19.320
It took me about two years and the novel was published in the late summer of 1962, 20 years ago.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.540
The novel is a good example of Bradbury's beautifully poetic style.

20:23.540 --> 20:28.100
It uses images of autumn and the gaudy colors of a carnival to convey hidden menace and evil.

20:28.720 --> 20:34.820
The carnival rides, for instance, do strange things to people and the sideshow freaks and grotesques have unnatural horrifying powers.

20:35.380 --> 20:39.000
Bradbury often uses carnival material as a symbol of evil. We asked him why.

20:40.700 --> 20:44.700
I think most of us are uncomfortable around carnivals and circuses.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.920
We sense that the people who run them are evil people.

20:48.100 --> 20:51.520
There is something wrong with most carnival people.

20:51.520 --> 20:56.600
The workers, it's a very tough life. It's a rough existence.

20:58.180 --> 21:05.120
It's run by a bunch of tramps and vagabonds and people who go from town to town, they have no roots.

21:06.840 --> 21:11.860
I should imagine there's a lot that goes on beyond the behind the scenes. We can't even guess that.

21:12.860 --> 21:16.660
Not that there isn't a hierarchy there and a big circus, of course, there is.

21:16.660 --> 21:22.220
There are the people at the top of the hierarchy or the trapeze people. They are the royal family.

21:22.620 --> 21:28.400
Then you go downwards through the various levels of performers depending on their athletic powers.

21:28.680 --> 21:35.900
But it's a very difficult life and it's a miracle if most of these people make it through and keep their sanity.

21:36.520 --> 21:43.860
When you're a child, you sense, especially in the seedy little carnivals that come to visit your hometown,

21:43.860 --> 21:55.220
you sense the uneasiness, the sly life, the sense of evil behind the scenes in these people.

21:55.580 --> 22:00.200
I suppose that's where my fictions came from.

22:00.940 --> 22:06.600
Something wicked this way comes is being made into a major motion picture by Disney Studios and should be out at the end of the year.

22:06.940 --> 22:09.220
We'll continue next time with the works of Ray Bradbury.

22:16.820 --> 22:22.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:22.500 --> 22:25.380
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:43.860 --> 23:13.840
The show is about the life of the world.

23:13.840 --> 23:17.360
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:33.060 --> 23:38.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.640
And here are your hosts.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.200
This is David Carson.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.140
And Daryl Lane.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.480
One of Ray Bradbury's classic novels is Fahrenheit 451.

23:52.920 --> 23:58.740
It's a chilling picture of a future society in which books are outlawed and humans are weakened by addiction to a totally electronic society.

23:59.480 --> 24:07.440
A person who possesses a book is subject to severe punishment and there's even a government institution composed of firemen whose job it is to seek out all books and burn them.

24:07.440 --> 24:12.560
We asked Bradbury if there was a particular episode or inspiration behind Fahrenheit 451.

24:37.440 --> 24:43.320
We asked him to write a few American books off of foreign library shelves in army libraries.

24:43.560 --> 24:49.600
And then President Eisenhower ordered them all put back on, which proved what a bright man he was.

24:49.820 --> 24:50.300
Thank goodness.

24:51.100 --> 25:00.140
But he was during that period that I suppose my subconscious permitted on all this and said,

25:00.140 --> 25:13.160
I've got to do a book about my anger about libraries because libraries is really the place where I was born and raised myself, grew up and have lived for a lifetime.

25:13.460 --> 25:15.460
They really are very super special to me.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.260
And I go in bookstores constantly.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.600
I can't stay away from them.

25:21.720 --> 25:22.940
I buy too many books.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.980
I'm compulsive about it.

25:24.980 --> 25:28.340
So the novel wrote itself in nine days.

25:28.780 --> 25:35.100
I went up to UCLA in 19, this is back in 1950.

25:35.540 --> 25:43.640
And I spent nine days there in the typing room in the basement of the UCLA library with about 12 students sitting around me.

25:43.820 --> 25:47.940
And I played these dime a half hour typewriter machines.

25:47.940 --> 25:55.520
And I typed the novel on those dime machines and I spent around $9.40 typing the novel.

25:56.140 --> 26:00.520
So it's a grand place to write a book like that, isn't it, in the basement of a library.

26:01.700 --> 26:05.480
Bradbury seems to be pointing out the dangers of a technological society in the novel.

26:05.940 --> 26:09.680
And some of his other work, like the Martian Chronicles, has some of the same warnings.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.500
We asked him if his work is anti-technological.

26:13.560 --> 26:17.500
Well, that's a misinterpretation. It's never been true.

26:17.980 --> 26:22.340
I've never mistrusted technology as only people. There's a big difference there.

26:22.660 --> 26:25.360
It's the way we use the automobile, for instance.

26:25.560 --> 26:30.480
There's nothing wrong with cars that having more safe drivers won't change.

26:31.620 --> 26:39.700
Now, when it comes to computers, space travel, IBM's electric typewriters, these are all beautiful.

26:39.700 --> 26:45.700
We're using them well. And the future is very exciting because of it.

26:46.340 --> 26:49.500
Now, I've tried to pick those technologies that I criticized.

26:50.180 --> 27:00.040
For instance, there was a certain moment in history in Los Angeles where they were threatening to put Muzak with advertising on our buses.

27:00.800 --> 27:05.440
And I immediately mounted a campaign with some friends, thousands of people who said,

27:05.440 --> 27:09.180
oh, no, you don't. Bad enough we have all these posters all over the place.

27:09.420 --> 27:16.240
But to trap us on buses, then, make us listen to music we don't want to hear, or advertisements we don't want to hear.

27:17.500 --> 27:23.840
So I'm anti the way that particular technology was going to be used.

27:24.860 --> 27:28.520
We asked Bradbury if he thought there was any danger of book burning or censorship today.

27:29.380 --> 27:35.500
We hear those rumors every year. And there are always some stupid librarians, some stupid mayor,

27:36.080 --> 27:42.800
or some dumb pressure group in some town somewhere in our country every year for the last 60 years.

27:42.980 --> 27:47.940
If it wants to censor this, it censor that. And then they blow away. They're just chaffin' the wind.

27:48.540 --> 27:53.840
And don't pay any attention to them. And if they grow giant size, call me on the phone.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.120
I'll come over and kick them in the kishkis. Okay?

28:03.600 --> 28:09.520
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:09.800 --> 28:12.720
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
