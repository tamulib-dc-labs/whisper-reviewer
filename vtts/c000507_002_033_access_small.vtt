00:01.740 --> 00:03.100
The tapes are on.

00:04.860 --> 00:12.360
Okay, so you wrote the Essex book, so yeah, could you kind of give us a general history of those, and then I'll hit on the specifics that you don't cover?

00:14.800 --> 00:24.540
Well, in the first place, I'd moved from Syracuse, New York, to Los Angeles District in the 65.

00:27.740 --> 00:36.820
And that time I was working as a tech writer for the space defense industry, and of course I was writing on the side.

00:37.300 --> 00:45.760
I built up a good backlog of science fiction novels and short stories, but I hadn't become a full-time writer.

00:45.760 --> 00:59.580
Well, in 1959, a month before the first moon landing, NASA had its funds cut way back, and thousands of people working in the space industry were laid off, including myself.

01:02.000 --> 01:11.220
So I couldn't get a job there for a while, and finally I got one, and I said, I want to go into full-time writing, and I did.

01:11.220 --> 01:21.460
Well, shortly thereafter, though I had a lot of money coming in from my book publishers, I couldn't get it out of them.

01:22.800 --> 01:31.820
I guess they were going through one of those slumps where they were reluctant to let loose funds, and they needed some money.

01:31.820 --> 01:49.920
Well, at that time I was approached by a fellow named Brian Kirby, who was a science fiction fan, but he also was an editor for a pornographic book publishing outfit, I think called American Art Agency.

01:51.540 --> 01:55.000
And he was starting a new line called Essex House.

01:57.420 --> 02:08.520
Although Brian had been an editor for some time in the porno field, he was pretty much disgusted with the books because, on the writing level, it was very low.

02:08.520 --> 02:22.800
There wasn't any characterization or plot or motivation, and very little imagination, and he wanted to raise the literary level of the porno books, at least the ones in the new line, Essex House.

02:23.460 --> 02:31.320
He also loved science fiction, so he approached a number of science fiction authors, asked them if they'd be interested.

02:32.240 --> 02:41.440
At that time, in 1969, I'd never even read one of those books, but she called Henry Miller, who's a porno writer, and I don't.

02:42.920 --> 02:49.760
And I said, yeah, I'm a writer, I'd like to try anything, I'll even write romance if I had to.

02:51.080 --> 02:57.760
So, he said there would be no taboos, or guidelines.

02:58.780 --> 03:07.280
Normally, in the porno books, they have guidelines in which you have to have a sex scene every four or five, six pages.

03:08.860 --> 03:11.600
He said you can write it exactly the way you want to.

03:11.600 --> 03:30.420
So, I decided that I would write a satirical postage on my two heroes, one Tarzan, and one the hero of the Pope magazine series, which started in the 30s, called Doc Savage.

03:31.860 --> 03:37.640
Doc Savage is pretty well known even now because Bannum reprinted, started reprinting his books in 1965.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.580
So, I wrote that, and I had a lot of fun with it.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.860
And it went out, where I didn't know.

03:50.140 --> 04:06.020
And then I wrote a book called The Image of the Beast, which was sort of a satir on Gothic, and also on private eye novels, and incidentally, it was a satir on porno books, too.

04:08.220 --> 04:13.680
So, that went out, and then I wrote a sequel called Blown, a sequel to The Image of the Beast.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.660
And about that time, I got kind of tired.

04:17.840 --> 04:27.860
I guess even if you have a vivid imagination, there's only so much that you can do with books that are basically sexual situations.

04:27.860 --> 04:35.100
And though I'd give it my best, I had characterization and humor and thought and motivation and all that.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.520
I kept tired of it, so I ceased writing for them.

04:40.980 --> 04:46.600
About that time, my publishers started coming through with all the money they owed me anyway.

04:47.780 --> 04:57.220
Now, what happened was that the people who ran the American Arts Agency knew nothing whatsoever about science fiction.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.200
All they knew was porno books.

05:00.620 --> 05:14.760
So, I made a very bad mistake in sending all these science fiction books, which I and some other science fiction readers had written, to porno book shops, not to the general book store.

05:14.760 --> 05:23.880
And as a result, they didn't sell well because the usual porno customer wasn't interested in them.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.500
And by the time that the science fiction people heard that these books were available,

05:29.420 --> 05:33.160
the American Art Agency had already decided to cancel Essex House.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.740
It wasn't a financial goal for them, but it was their own fault.

05:37.680 --> 05:44.080
I don't know how many of these three books that I wrote were printed.

05:45.480 --> 05:53.760
I do know that at one time I was told there were hundreds or maybe even thousands in a warehouse in Los Angeles.

05:55.620 --> 06:04.000
But I've never been able to find out if they're still there or what because the American Art Agency closed up a couple of years ago.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.620
And I've had no success in getting hold of the person who's handling the estate.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.220
Is that enough or you want to ask me a question?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.160
No, that sounds good.

06:15.720 --> 06:23.040
Does it surprise you that the books are now considered to be top-end collector's items in command?

06:23.600 --> 06:28.160
Oh, I've seen them anywhere from $75 to $150 apiece. Did that ever enter your mind?

06:28.720 --> 06:31.480
Well, it never entered my mind at the time I wrote them.

06:31.700 --> 06:36.040
If I had, I would have kept the copies that Brian Kirby gave me.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.520
As it was, I just passed them out to friends there and there.

06:39.780 --> 06:44.920
And as a result, I only have about one or two samples of each of them.

06:45.540 --> 06:51.380
If I'd known what was going to happen, I would have purchased three or four boxfuls myself.

06:52.360 --> 07:01.360
When the word got around, my, of course, collectors, being what they are, they look for rare and unusual books and they had difficulty finding them.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.600
So of course the price went up right away and it's been going up steadily since then.

07:07.220 --> 07:19.600
Another aspect of that was that after the American Art Agency folded, I got my rights back to the books and then I tried to sell them to a national publisher.

07:19.600 --> 07:25.480
But I didn't have any success for ten years. Nobody would touch them.

07:26.400 --> 07:33.040
And then finally, Playboy Press decided to publish them.

07:33.340 --> 07:41.760
And Gannada in England decided that they would do it. Also another publisher, I forget their name.

07:43.140 --> 07:49.880
The English publishers were taking a chance because they were afraid they would be bought to court as it happened.

07:51.740 --> 07:53.120
They got by OK.

07:54.880 --> 08:04.840
And now of course, like the books are in comparison with other books dealing with sex or not.

08:05.540 --> 08:19.460
Well, I wouldn't exactly call them innocuous, but they're far-ranging sexual ideas are not so much that they can't be accepted now.

08:20.180 --> 08:26.580
Back in 69 and 70 when I wrote them, my national publishers just tried to take a chance with them.

08:28.820 --> 08:35.500
I always thought that the Doc Callahan character on the front of a feast unknown looked kind of like you.

08:36.180 --> 08:39.100
The hair and the general facial features, is that just coincidence?

08:40.600 --> 08:48.080
Well, it probably is unless Brian Kirby described me to the artist. What she could have done.

08:50.540 --> 08:52.340
I never thought about told truth.

08:53.440 --> 08:57.120
It's kind of a last gasp there.

08:58.820 --> 09:08.340
Now Lord of the Trees and the Mad Goblin are clean sequels to the feast unknown.

09:09.140 --> 09:16.660
And did you just kind of do those to keep up with the fun, the past-ish type writing?

09:16.660 --> 09:18.100
Yeah, that was the main thing.

09:18.260 --> 09:36.620
The thing was of course that in the feast unknown, my two heroes Doc Callahan and Lord Gerbertson were engaged in eliminating this ancient evil council of nine.

09:36.900 --> 09:38.960
And they'd only knocked off a few in the first book.

09:39.280 --> 09:44.420
So I wanted to continue their adventures which they did in the Mad Goblin and the Lord of the Trees.

09:45.460 --> 09:49.760
And they succeeded in eliminating a few more of the council of nine.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.440
However, there are still some left.

09:51.720 --> 09:58.980
So I plan on writing at least one sequel to those finishing up the job.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.020
Although I don't know when I'm going to do it.

10:01.160 --> 10:07.220
You know, actually I have about 15 theories going, none of which I've ever finished.

10:09.520 --> 10:20.640
Well, when I was young and went to a psychologist while I was attending a university in Missouri, he commented that I had terrible difficulty in finishing anything.

10:23.640 --> 10:26.220
So we'll look forward to seeing some more of those then.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.780
Well, I hope so. I had a lot of fun writing them.

10:29.380 --> 10:33.420
And I didn't continue the sexual theme in them.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.840
In the first place, I think I exhausted them in the first two books.

10:37.160 --> 10:45.900
And the second place, it's difficult to get publishers to accept them if you do have that theme there.

10:47.400 --> 10:53.280
A less obvious sequel to me was Trader to the Living as a sequel to Blown.

10:54.080 --> 10:58.560
It seems like it was a little more subtle there that that might be a sequel.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.660
Is it a sequel? Can it be considered a sequel?

11:01.000 --> 11:01.940
Oh, yeah, that's a sequel.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.920
Oh, I think some of the readers weren't aware of it at the time.

11:07.020 --> 11:09.600
Actually, that's why I don't prefer another sequel, too, you know.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.180
Good. I enjoyed it.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.900
Okay, what about Love Song then? That was Brandon House.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.460
Are they connected with Essex House or how did that come about?

11:23.660 --> 11:27.080
Well, I guess it was like, yeah, okay.

11:27.520 --> 11:34.460
I wrote that about the time and I decided I wasn't going to do it anymore, but I already had a contract.

11:35.020 --> 11:38.680
So I wrote it. It was not science fiction.

11:39.300 --> 11:44.160
It sounded like Gothic, but it had a rational explanation at the end.

11:45.880 --> 11:50.640
That's even rarer, but then the feast on the Ones, the Beasts and Blown.

11:51.000 --> 11:51.800
So I've noticed.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.420
Very difficult to get hold of.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.820
Again, I only have one copy.

11:56.660 --> 11:59.260
Now, it has not been reprinted anywhere, has it?

12:00.900 --> 12:07.060
No. I wanted to write in to whoever was handling this state and get the rights back.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.840
Of course, I can't find him.

12:11.180 --> 12:13.440
This wasn't Brian Kirby and Essex House.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.020
That Brandon House is something different.

12:16.520 --> 12:22.000
It was Brandon House was a line that had existed before Essex House.

12:22.620 --> 12:30.760
But when Essex House ceased, then Brian Kirby went back to Brandon House, which he was with before he started Essex House.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.940
And that was done with him.

12:34.580 --> 12:40.960
Although by the time I'd finished the book, and if I remember correctly, Brian Kirby had already left American Art Agency.

12:46.280 --> 12:53.860
If I can ever find the guy that's handling the business, well, I'll get the rights back to that and see this reprint.

12:54.780 --> 13:01.960
So, for all I know, he died or he's unhiding for the police or went to Brazil or something.

13:03.680 --> 13:13.900
Okay. While we're still in the gutter here, in the book by a guy named Lawrence Knapp called the first editions of Philip Jose Farmer,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.640
he says that you wrote a book called As You Desire with a pseudonym William Norfolk.

13:19.260 --> 13:20.040
Is that true?

13:21.900 --> 13:22.800
Yeah, that's true.

13:24.900 --> 13:39.740
But what happened was, I wrote that, a friend of mine who's working for another house came down and I was still needed money.

13:42.200 --> 13:47.520
And I agreed with him to write it, but I said I wanted to do it under an armed plume.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.700
So, I sent the manuscript to him.

13:52.520 --> 13:57.020
I don't remember offhand the name of the house that took it.

13:58.040 --> 14:03.620
And for years, I thought that they'd published it, but just had never bothered to send me a copy.

14:04.440 --> 14:09.200
However, I found out in the last couple of years that they had gone under.

14:09.920 --> 14:17.460
And they'd sold all their manuscripts to the American Art Agency, which also went under.

14:18.740 --> 14:25.900
So, the original manuscript is in possession of the American Art Agency in somewhere else up in North Hollywood.

14:26.680 --> 14:34.260
So, for the collectors that are going to be reading this, yes, you did write it, but it has never been released as a book.

14:34.860 --> 14:40.620
No, I do have a carbon in the manuscript, but I've made no effort to send it out.

14:42.500 --> 14:51.480
Well, in light of all the meanings and subtleties to the pseudonyms that you use, is there anything to the Noam Deplume William Norfolk?

14:54.480 --> 14:58.820
Well, excuse me, something symbolic or significant in the Noam Deplume, right?

15:02.040 --> 15:12.080
Takeover. But this was the first time I ever did something under another name, and there wasn't any particular significance attached to that,

15:12.980 --> 15:19.080
except that they said if you had MD after the title, it seemed to attract more readers.

15:20.080 --> 15:25.340
Of course, I didn't say what MD stood for. It could have been Doctor of Madness.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.500
That sounds apropos.

15:29.240 --> 15:36.740
Yeah, well, at the time I was thinking about choosing the pseudonym. I happened to be reading Berks Periods, and I was reading about the Duke of Norfolk.

15:37.180 --> 15:38.480
Oh, Norfolk, that's a good name.

15:41.240 --> 15:48.800
Can you give us just a very brief outline? Is that a science fiction book or a fantasy book or just a mainstream book or what?

15:48.800 --> 15:58.020
No, it again is a pornographic romance, I'd call it.

15:59.120 --> 16:06.740
It has to do with lesbianism and also spooky houses and ghosts and all that sort of stuff.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.200
Okay.

16:11.280 --> 16:15.120
My manuscript is a real collector's item because I'm the only one that has it.

16:17.020 --> 16:21.400
I haven't gotten any offers for it yet, and I probably wouldn't sell it.

16:21.920 --> 16:28.900
But as years go by, it becomes more valuable. It might make up for all those collector's items I gave away.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.160
Okay, yeah, maybe you can retire on that since you did.

16:34.180 --> 16:35.760
Well, I doubt if I could retire on it.

16:38.160 --> 16:47.140
Okay, what we want to do is change our cassette tape over to the other side and then we'll start talking about Oz.

16:47.660 --> 16:57.140
Now, what I'm going to do, Mr. Farmer, is send this to Fred Greenberg in New Jersey, and he's going to transcribe it, and we're going to use this in his paperback advertiser.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.520
If you would like copies of that, I'd be glad to send you some when it comes out.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.260
Oh, yeah, I would for my bibliography.

17:05.260 --> 17:07.180
You bet. There'll be several of them.

17:07.240 --> 17:07.360
My address?

17:08.040 --> 17:08.580
Pardon me?

17:08.820 --> 17:10.040
Do you have my address?

17:10.120 --> 17:10.780
Yes, sir, I do.

17:13.260 --> 17:20.840
I don't know. I think it'll probably be one or two months, but I have the four, the three Essex and the brand of books.

17:21.020 --> 17:24.960
So we took pictures of them and we'll have pictures in there just so people can see what they look like.

17:25.200 --> 17:25.380
Okay.

17:26.360 --> 17:31.000
I was kind of glad to hear that, as you desire, it hadn't come out because I don't have it.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.900
And I've got everything else you did in the first edition, so I thought I was going to have to go looking for it.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.680
Well, maybe someday I might rewrite it.

17:40.260 --> 17:40.740
Okay.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.360
I just got through rereading. We're still rewinding here.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.560
I just got through reading the Purple Book. I enjoyed that.

17:48.700 --> 17:54.660
I'd read the New Writers of the Purple Wage, but I hadn't read the others, and I enjoyed that.

17:54.660 --> 18:03.380
Oh, thank you. I had a lot of fun writing the Making of Revelation part one and also a purple passage to Rip Van Lincoln.

18:04.580 --> 18:07.640
Yeah, I would think you would have enjoyed that.

18:08.640 --> 18:12.640
Okay, are we rewound and are we turned over?

18:13.300 --> 18:13.640
Tapes rolling.

18:14.000 --> 18:21.880
Okay, the tapes rolling, so we'll start talking about Oz now in light of your barnstormer and Oz.

18:22.460 --> 18:26.780
Did you read the Oz books when you were a child or as a young adult?

18:28.560 --> 18:35.440
Well, I started reading them when I was very young. I think about six or seven years old.

18:36.020 --> 18:42.420
Our local library here in Peoria, the Brant's Library, had all the books by bound.

18:43.220 --> 18:46.360
And I loved them and read them, re-read them.

18:48.540 --> 19:02.180
And then a couple of about two years ago, I joined the International Wizard of Oz Club, which is composed of people who are devoted to bound works,

19:02.460 --> 19:05.700
and they put out a quarterly called the Bound Jiggle.

19:05.700 --> 19:12.260
I also went out and repurchased all the bounds books.

19:12.540 --> 19:18.940
I had a collection that they were destroyed in the flesh flood in Los Angeles while I was there.

19:19.540 --> 19:27.320
And then I got all the Oz books by Ruth Plumlee Thompson, who continued the series after Baum died.

19:27.980 --> 19:37.840
And I have books by Oz books by several other people, Jack Snow, also Neil, who illustrated bound books for a couple.

19:39.300 --> 19:46.140
And I'd always had a desire ever since I was young to be a writer, and I'd always wanted to write an Oz book.

19:46.580 --> 19:50.820
But I didn't get around to it until I was 64 years old.

19:50.820 --> 19:59.880
Now, of course, the book that I would write when I'm 64 is quite different from the one that I would write by ever ten or eleven, you know?

20:01.400 --> 20:17.460
So I'm waiting to hear the reaction from the members of the International Wizard of Oz Club, because this, as you know, assumes that only the first Oz book, the wonderful Wizard of Oz, is true.

20:17.460 --> 20:19.920
And that's all the rest for fiction.

20:20.640 --> 20:26.320
And then it approaches Oz from a science fictional viewpoint. That is, it could have existed.

20:27.100 --> 20:34.320
If it did, then you have to explain how Scarecrow could be animated and sentient and talk.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.260
What would happen if animals could talk?

20:37.260 --> 20:51.780
How do you account for the Tim Woodman's piecemeal method of being reconstructed out of Tim and explain magic and all that sort of stuff from just where Oz was?

20:52.540 --> 20:56.520
I had a lot of fun doing it, but I also had to do an awful lot of research.

20:58.200 --> 21:05.740
Because it took place in 1923, and I had to read all about what was happening in America at that time.

21:09.720 --> 21:25.000
And I've been a World War I early aviation buff, and I have a considerable library on that, but I still had to look up a lot of things on the Jennings and on the machine guns and the B.A.R.s of that period and Army organization.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.760
Politics and all that sort of thing.

21:30.180 --> 21:40.920
Plus, of course, the agonizing task of being able to explain in a rational manner just how the land of Oz could exist and how all these beings could exist.

21:43.280 --> 21:48.860
Also, there's something you may not have noticed. There's a character in there called Shirtless.

21:51.020 --> 21:54.360
And he actually is a sort of a wild Doc Savage.

21:56.320 --> 22:07.120
If you were acquainted with the first Doc Savage magazine that came out, you will see the Shirtless torn the shreds.

22:08.760 --> 22:18.380
And when the 1965 free issues by Bannum came out, the artist, what was his name?

22:19.200 --> 22:22.140
I can't remember it right off, off right hand.

22:23.180 --> 22:25.780
But anyway, he continued that torn shirt motif.

22:28.960 --> 22:33.720
So Shirtless is sort of an Ozzie and takeoff from Doc Savage.

22:34.620 --> 22:45.780
Plus, the fact that his companion, the Rare Beast logo, is sort of a takeoff from Doc Savage's apy buddy, Monk Mayfair.

22:47.920 --> 22:53.660
It doesn't matter to the reader whether he knows that or not, but if he does know it, it might add a little extra savor.

22:55.640 --> 23:03.160
I didn't catch that. When I read it, I figured there was something there, but I haven't read everything yet.

23:03.240 --> 23:07.920
And one of the things I have not read is Doc Savage. And so I don't get those subtle points.

23:08.160 --> 23:13.820
Well, that's all right. That's just something I add in case you do happen to know it.

23:13.940 --> 23:19.640
Fine, but Shirtless and the Rare Beast stand out by themselves with characters.

23:20.360 --> 23:23.620
Anyway, I departed with a 90 degree angle from the original model.

23:25.080 --> 23:33.520
When I make the shows based on this tape, I'm going to put that in because that's one of the things that makes this fun to find out things like that.

23:34.460 --> 23:45.640
I guess if you hadn't arbitrar- well, I guess not arbitrarily, but if you hadn't cut it off after the first volume and said everything there after was fantasy, the task of writing it would have been that much more complicated.

23:45.640 --> 23:56.020
Well, it would have been impossible because Baum's books had so many changes and contradictions in them later on that it would be impossible to explain.

23:57.760 --> 24:11.540
Plus the fact that if you are writing an original Oz novel, you can do it without getting permission from the people on the copyright because the first two books have gone out of copyright.

24:11.540 --> 24:20.540
I ascertained that before I thought seriously about starting to write on them.

24:20.920 --> 24:38.680
I wrote to Riley Company in Chicago and they told me that I could go ahead and write an Oz novel as long as I did not use any new characters or places in the later books.

24:38.680 --> 24:45.660
That is, those that were written after the first two, if they contain new characters, let's say like the hungry tiger.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.780
Maybe he was in second.

24:50.000 --> 24:58.140
Well, anyway, there were a number of characters like the Noem King that could not have used because they were in the later books.

24:59.860 --> 25:06.060
But the main thing was, obviously, the later books were fiction.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.060
I mean, there were so many contradictions and changes.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.060
Why was Oz so popular?

25:15.320 --> 25:19.500
I guess it was almost an instant success and it continues this and it still is popular.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.320
Why do you think that those books are so popular?

25:23.360 --> 25:37.640
Well, of course, there were many books written back in 1900 and afterwards about foreign lands or ferry land.

25:38.820 --> 25:44.500
But what Baum did was to create a magnificent quest.

25:45.700 --> 25:58.220
And what you have, Dorothy, looking for a way of getting home, the Carly Lyons running Courage, Tim Woodman running a heart, and Scarecrow running brains.

26:00.180 --> 26:05.280
Now, the thing is, they all thought that the wonderful Wizard of Oz could give us to him.

26:06.180 --> 26:10.400
Well, he told him he would, but he put him through a series of trials.

26:10.680 --> 26:15.200
You know, first they had to go out and kill the wicked witches of the West.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.580
And I forget offhand what the other quest was.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.500
But the point was that they had all these qualities that they wanted.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.340
The Scarecrow was ignorant, but he was intelligent.

26:30.340 --> 26:36.040
And Tim Woodman had a very tender heart, even if he didn't have a heart inside that tender heart.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.540
And the Carly Lyons was like all of us.

26:40.620 --> 26:45.680
He gets scared, but he was able to overcome his fear.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.420
But they needed some magical reassurance.

26:51.100 --> 26:59.300
And finally, when they exposed the Wizard of Oz as a humbug, he still concocted devices.

27:01.180 --> 27:04.240
Physical devices, which were symbols of what they wanted.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.760
You know, he had the Carly Lyons drink a pot of courage.

27:08.100 --> 27:10.760
Somebody had suggested, probably Dutch courage.

27:11.760 --> 27:20.220
And he made a heart out of velvet filled with sawdust and put it inside the Tim Woodman's body.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.640
And he stuck... oh, okay.

27:28.660 --> 27:33.120
He put Bran inside the Scarecrow's head, and then he put needles in him.

27:33.140 --> 27:37.240
And he said his head was brand new now, and sharp, needle sharp, of course.

27:37.840 --> 27:38.860
The bottom was great for fun.

27:40.060 --> 27:45.860
And having these physical evidence of things they wanted, they could seem to be very happy.

27:45.860 --> 27:49.100
Although they'd had these qualities all this time.

27:49.860 --> 27:58.820
And I think that moral there, plus the wonderful quest that found both form,

28:01.960 --> 28:06.780
is something that appealed to the hearts of all the kids and of course adults, too.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.440
And then, of course, Dorothy had had the means of getting home all the time,

28:11.440 --> 28:17.080
because when the wicked witch of the east was crushed by her house, dropping out of the cyclone,

28:19.500 --> 28:22.700
she put on the silver slippers of the witch.

28:24.480 --> 28:29.640
And wore them all through her adventure, not knowing that all she had to do was wish to be back in Kansas,

28:29.760 --> 28:30.600
and she could go home.

28:31.040 --> 28:38.500
It wasn't until Glenda the good at the end of the book told her that her shoes could do it,

28:38.500 --> 28:44.880
and Dorothy realized that all this time she could have gone home a few minutes after she got into it,

28:44.940 --> 28:45.760
if she'd wanted to.

28:47.300 --> 28:50.080
In other words, Bob was saying, well, look around you.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.900
Maybe you have the means for success or escape around you.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.060
You don't have to find some magical means.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.540
Although, of course, the silver slippers were magical.

29:00.460 --> 29:03.720
Well, anyway, that's my explanation of popularity of the book.

29:05.400 --> 29:13.980
And of course there are millions, I suppose, who've never read the book, who know about Oz through the movie.

29:17.880 --> 29:25.820
In A Bond Storm Revised, you, the character that interested me most, it seemed to be the character you were most into,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.220
was Glenda the good or Glenda the ambiguous.

29:28.640 --> 29:29.820
Yeah, I'm not going.

29:30.380 --> 29:32.660
Okay, she was an interesting character.

29:33.760 --> 29:40.860
Yeah, well, I sort of fell in love with Glenda when I was little, and of course now being almost 65,

29:41.200 --> 29:47.560
I have sort of an adult view point of Oz.

29:48.160 --> 29:53.620
I can still enjoy it in an almost childlike manner, but now being an adult,

29:53.620 --> 29:58.940
I can see that there are profundity of three dimensions to that.

29:59.780 --> 30:08.020
Then it came to me that perhaps all these adventures of dirt that had gone through had been sort of subtly arranged by Glenda,

30:08.660 --> 30:13.820
in order to knock off one, the Witch of the East and two of the Witch of the West,

30:14.060 --> 30:18.220
and also get rid of the wizard whom she knew was a humbug.

30:21.280 --> 30:24.940
Well, I became very much interested in her character, and then I thought, hmm,

30:25.220 --> 30:29.400
President Harding died in 1923, did Glenda have anything to do with that?

30:33.600 --> 30:37.600
Are you going to blame the Depression on her in a sequel, maybe?

30:38.260 --> 30:39.780
No, I hadn't thought about that.

30:40.080 --> 30:40.960
Well, that's a good idea.

30:41.300 --> 30:42.940
I'd have somebody else responsible for it.

30:45.300 --> 30:50.080
You know, Pete, I kind of like these big paranoia things anyway,

30:50.080 --> 30:57.200
like one person's potting or making conspiracies overthrow the whole world and all that.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.120
When you wrote Barnstormer?

30:59.480 --> 31:00.500
Yeah, I have to write that down.

31:00.920 --> 31:01.480
Okay.

31:02.940 --> 31:06.580
When you wrote Barnstormer, what audience were you aiming for?

31:08.820 --> 31:10.160
A science fiction audience.

31:12.560 --> 31:16.460
Although, of course, there are a lot of people who don't read much science fiction,

31:16.660 --> 31:17.880
who are still like Oz.

31:20.160 --> 31:22.580
But primarily, I think I was writing it for myself.

31:23.020 --> 31:26.260
I mean, you know, you get down to the bottom of it,

31:26.260 --> 31:30.240
because I've always loved Oz, and I always wanted to write it for Oz, but I finally did it.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.620
And I might write another one, because when I got to the end, I realized that

31:35.520 --> 31:40.880
I really hadn't developed, uh, Jenny, the animated airplane enough.

31:42.860 --> 31:49.060
But the fact that Oz is beautiful, there are always more wonders there, you know.

31:50.520 --> 31:54.900
I might write one more, maybe four or five years from now.

31:55.260 --> 31:57.300
That was going to be my next question.

31:57.500 --> 32:00.120
It seemed that it didn't end abruptly,

32:00.120 --> 32:04.960
but nonetheless, there were a few things that the reader, I think, would like to know about.

32:05.540 --> 32:07.820
So it would be appreciated if you continued it.

32:08.400 --> 32:13.540
Yeah, well, as I said in the afterward, I had planned on Hank Stover, my hero,

32:15.500 --> 32:20.680
encountering the old and dying Wizard of Oz up in the North Country, you know.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.680
But just wasn't time enough.

32:23.800 --> 32:27.140
I was under a lot of pressure to get the manuscript in in time.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.920
But I could use that in a sequel, for instance.

32:31.660 --> 32:34.560
Because I had a pretty interesting theme that gets out in the night.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.400
And there are a lot of other things.

32:38.900 --> 32:41.300
Well, yeah, I think it's a science fiction book.

32:42.540 --> 32:46.640
It took what Baum had set out, and then I tried to extrapolate it.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.680
Extrapolate from it, go deeper.

32:50.660 --> 32:56.100
A lot of things that Baum, who was writing a fairy tale for children, just glossed over it.

32:56.100 --> 33:01.660
Which he should have done, because children aren't interested in great detail.

33:01.900 --> 33:07.760
But the background that Baum furnished, that I had to go ahead and figure out

33:07.760 --> 33:11.420
just what kind of society would have existed in Oz.

33:12.340 --> 33:19.820
And, for instance, the effect of intelligent, language-speaking animals.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.280
What would that have on society?

33:22.280 --> 33:29.220
Certainly Oz society would not be much like Earth society.

33:30.220 --> 33:34.560
Just because of the present of those animals.

33:35.980 --> 33:44.440
Just like you had almost extra-terrestrial people living among you.

33:44.440 --> 33:51.420
You don't really have to deal, you know, and strike some sort of social balance with it.

33:53.060 --> 33:58.880
I was also struck by the explanation for the purpose of Scarecrow's in Oz.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.820
Yeah, that was a complete twist, right?

34:04.300 --> 34:09.440
Scarecrow's instead of being set up to scare away the crows

34:09.440 --> 34:13.020
or set up there to advertise the fact that there was food growing there for them.

34:15.180 --> 34:17.300
Well, that's the only way it could be.

34:18.200 --> 34:21.540
If crows, as the intelligent human beings, then can talk,

34:21.680 --> 34:24.280
they're not going to be fooled one minute by Scarecrow, right?

34:25.100 --> 34:27.820
But Dorothy had it soon, because of her short stay there.

34:28.600 --> 34:32.640
Scarecrow's were up there for the purpose they were set up for on Earth.

34:33.620 --> 34:34.720
But I figured out otherwise.

34:37.300 --> 34:42.880
The other interesting reaction that I had was when I read the scene

34:42.880 --> 34:47.700
in which the pilot of the first mission that tried to make it through,

34:47.780 --> 34:53.000
when the pilot was killed, when they buried him and they had this barbaric funeral ritual.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.580
That was kind of interesting as well.

34:55.580 --> 35:03.440
Well, Oz is not a namby-pamby land.

35:04.600 --> 35:10.000
It's real and inhabited by real people, even if they're very short people.

35:13.460 --> 35:16.500
And if you have people who are descended from the ancient gods,

35:16.800 --> 35:19.180
who intermingled with the Anifles originally,

35:19.180 --> 35:26.880
then you're not going to have a society quite like the medieval societies of Earth.

35:27.060 --> 35:29.500
There would be a lot of customs that would be different.

35:32.400 --> 35:38.960
And like all societies, even Oz society, you know, has its sinister aspects,

35:39.340 --> 35:41.720
its frightening aspects, its alien aspects.

35:47.220 --> 35:54.300
So I'll go into more depth on that in the sequel,

35:54.640 --> 35:59.880
or possibly if I were to write that quaddling translation of the Wizard of Oz.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.680
I might go into that in the forward frame.

36:05.580 --> 36:11.440
Have you gotten any feedback from either Fred Meyer or the people in the International Wizard of Oz fan club,

36:11.440 --> 36:13.120
or just any Oz fans in general?

36:14.860 --> 36:23.840
Yeah, I got a letter from Nick Corral-Linkel who apparently has done some movie work too.

36:24.600 --> 36:30.120
And he even wrote a documentary on Oz once, which Disney didn't take,

36:30.280 --> 36:32.400
because they said they wanted to take a different direction.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.680
But he still has hopes of producing it someday.

36:35.480 --> 36:36.980
And he loved it.

36:37.660 --> 36:40.400
And as a matter of fact, he's going to call me up,

36:40.860 --> 36:47.360
maybe the second for an interview, which will be printed on the Balm Bugle, I believe.

36:48.160 --> 36:48.980
Oh good, okay.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.020
It'll be accompanying a review of the book.

36:52.560 --> 36:56.600
Hey, Fred Meyer sent me a copy of the Balm Bugle, which I had not seen before,

36:56.800 --> 37:02.160
and it had all sorts of things about the history of Oz as a stage play and that sort of thing.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.620
It was really interesting. I didn't realize it had that much background.

37:04.620 --> 37:10.820
Well, yeah, the Wizard of Oz club takes a very scholarly approach to everything,

37:10.880 --> 37:15.900
and they've really gone in to all the Balm's works in great depth.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.860
I'm not really an... I guess I am kind of a fan.

37:22.240 --> 37:26.600
I never would have read it except I have a daughter who's now five,

37:26.740 --> 37:30.820
and I guess I'm in volume ten. I'm reading her a chapter a night.

37:30.820 --> 37:38.380
And so I was... Of course, I'd seen the movie, but I really enjoyed a barnstormer

37:38.380 --> 37:44.620
because I had read the first one, and I could understand why you chose not to go into the rest of it

37:44.620 --> 37:47.120
and treated them as fantasy because of all the things.

37:47.200 --> 37:52.200
But it's really enjoyable to see it, to read it myself and then to see it through her eyes,

37:52.240 --> 37:54.520
because she obviously sees it on a different level.

37:55.100 --> 38:02.800
Yeah, well, I'm glad you're doing that. I'm starting off my granddaughter on the Oz book.

38:05.100 --> 38:08.980
And I hope that she'll have the same enthusiasm that I had for her.

38:09.260 --> 38:13.280
The only thing I do sometimes... The English gets a bit antiquated,

38:13.280 --> 38:20.420
so I maybe modernize it just a little bit, just so she'll know what the guy's really doing.

38:20.980 --> 38:22.800
Well, I can understand that. She's five.

38:22.800 --> 38:27.160
He's climbing the stairs. He's not ascending the whatever.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.740
Five-year-olds don't quite get all that... the flowery language sometimes.

38:32.060 --> 38:36.200
Yeah, but later on when she starts reading herself, you know,

38:36.260 --> 38:39.500
she'll be able to tackle the problem in difficulty.

38:40.200 --> 38:44.100
Mr. Farmer, that's it. I do appreciate getting to talk to you about this.

38:44.880 --> 38:45.780
Oh, I'm glad to do it.

38:45.940 --> 38:49.820
Great. I enjoyed meeting you in June in Dallas.

38:49.820 --> 38:55.160
I didn't have my copy of Love Song then, so I'll have to go to a con where you're at one of these days and get it signed.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.520
Yeah, you could always mail it to me. I can mail it back.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.760
Okay, I may do that. I'll...

38:59.760 --> 39:01.880
Better ensure it doesn't get lost.

39:02.100 --> 39:05.940

Yeah.

39:06.900 --> 39:09.640

Okay.

39:15.900 --> 39:16.840
Take care, Mr. Farmer.
