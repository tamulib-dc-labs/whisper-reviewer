00:01.620 --> 00:09.600
Roger, would you give us a little bit of background, kind of how you grew up and
how you got interested initially in science fiction? How I grew up, while I was

00:09.600 --> 00:23.800
first born, yes, my father had been interested in science fiction from the days
of Gernsback with Amazing Stories, and one of the first presents that I got that

00:23.800 --> 00:34.400
I remember getting was a complete set at the time of the old Ace Double novels.
Golly, I must have been seven or eight years old at the time, and I read those

00:34.400 --> 00:44.080
avidly, and then I went on to other things. I went on to Childhood's End by
Arthur C. Clarke and a mirror for observers by Edgar Pangborn, and I really

00:44.080 --> 00:54.420
liked it. In fact, I liked both of them, and I liked science fiction so much
that I tended to read science fiction in those years and not other types of

00:54.420 --> 01:02.120
fiction. Other people may have been reading Tarzan or whatever, but i would read
only science fiction principally science fiction by pool anderson as i mentioned

01:02.120 --> 01:11.980
author c clark and and so on and i just grew to love it i uh i think i still
have a list somewhere of every science fiction book that i i read during my teen

01:11.980 --> 01:21.260
years and then uh i think i was in my early 20s when i got the idea after
reading some anthologies that maybe i could do an anthology possibly as good as

01:21.260 --> 01:31.780
anybody else so the first couple that i got together from uh magazines
Clippingum story here, the first couple were rejected. And then I met Sam

01:31.780 --> 01:42.740
Moskowitz, and he and I did an anthology together called Alien Worlds for
Paperback Library. That did well, in fact, and they signed a second anthology

01:42.740 --> 01:54.560
entitled Invasion of the Robots. Neither of those two built Sam's name directly,
and apparently, if I remember correctly, that's the way he wanted it. But

01:54.560 --> 02:03.160
subsequent to those two, Sam and I went on to do several directly, and then I
worked with a fine gentleman named Vic Gadaglia, who is now director of

02:03.160 --> 02:13.680
publicity for ABC Television in New York. We did, oh, three or four, possibly as
many as five, together. And if I remember correctly, all of those anthologies

02:13.680 --> 02:25.860
were of reprinted material. I started to branch out on my own doing anthologies
on a solo basis, was principally commissioning original stories by well-known

02:25.860 --> 02:35.720
authors and beginning authors, and I, as it turned out, had access to the
authors directly, perhaps a little more than Sam or Vic did, so we didn't part

02:35.720 --> 02:47.060
company so much in a very unfriendly way, we parted company in a friendly way,
and we went off in different directions, and I don't, except for Epoch with Bob

02:47.060 --> 03:00.260
Silverberg and Spine Chillers for Doubleday with Howard Goldsmith. I don't
believe... Oh, yes, and Saving Worlds with Virginia Kidd. I have not done any

03:00.260 --> 03:11.140
anthologies, with those three exceptions, with anybody else. I've worked
principally on a solo-editor basis for ten years now. And in that period of ten

03:11.140 --> 03:19.480
years... Oh, including novels, collections, one-author collections, and
anthologies, is I've done over 100 books.

03:22.540 --> 03:36.300
The main reason I wanted to talk to you is that you have been a very prolific
editor, and I wanted to take the chance to explore how one sets up an anthology,

03:36.300 --> 03:45.160
how you get the idea. Of course, you can't answer how you get the idea. But how
the idea gestates, and then how you approach publishers with the idea, how you

03:45.160 --> 03:56.040
line the stories, that sort of thing. Could you give us a sketch, Let me use an
anthology entitled Future City. I originally did it for Trident Press, which was

03:56.040 --> 04:04.960
a division of Simon & Schusten. Then it went into paperback through pocketbooks.
I got to know the editor there at the time, Bernard Shercliffe, who I believe is

04:04.960 --> 04:16.520
now with Warner Paperback Books. I said to Bernie, and by that time I had built
up a credit list of enough reprint and a few isolated original anthologies that

04:16.520 --> 04:25.200
I could send him some of these as examples, and he liked what he saw, and he
said, well, what would you like to do? He said, are there themes that we'd like

04:25.200 --> 04:34.100
to cover, urban development or whatever? And I said, well, why don't we do an
anthology based upon the theme of the city of the future and what the destiny of

04:34.100 --> 04:44.200
the city is going to be? And he liked it, and I sent him a page or two proposal,
and we talked a couple more times by phone, and to my surprise and pleasure,

04:44.200 --> 04:56.060
they sent me a good contract. And then as I started to develop the anthology,
most original anthologies, even around a theme, are somewhat hodgepodge-y. And

04:56.060 --> 05:07.760
as good as Epoch was, maybe which I did with Bob Soberberg, it still is a
collection of diverse stories by diverse writers on a variety of themes. And I

05:07.760 --> 05:18.360
wanted future cities, I got into it to have a central cohesion that you don't
always find even in themed anthologies. So what we did was I designed it as

05:18.360 --> 05:29.660
though, in a sense, it were a kind of episodic novel written by 15 or 20
different people. Each chapter was a story written by 15 or 20 different people.

05:29.760 --> 05:42.000
And as the anthology started out, the story or stories were reasonably
optimistic or at least not unduly negative. And then as the anthology

05:42.000 --> 05:53.960
progressed, we have a chronological and psychological dissipation, if you will,
and the stories became increasingly pessimistic. And the last story involves the

05:53.960 --> 06:05.140
world blowing up and all cities going into dust. So we start out optimistically,
progress to moderately pessimistic, progress to a story which ended with no

06:05.140 --> 06:15.780
hope. And so there you have a cohesion that just most anthologies, original or
otherwise, do not have. And it was a lot more fun to do and more artistically

06:15.780 --> 06:27.000
challenging because you're handing out assignments, as it were, to 15, 20
authors. And how much do you guide the author in terms of having the author fit

06:27.000 --> 06:39.240
the story into where that story would fit in the anthology? And of course, I got
in a number of stories, at that time I got in hundreds of stories on an

06:39.240 --> 06:49.140
unsolicited basis, and for this anthology, one or two or three were quite good.
And there I had the luxury of reading the story first and finding out where it

06:49.140 --> 06:58.420
fit. But normally with original, all new anthologies where you assign the
stories, it's a little difficult. So there was a little bit of trial and error.

06:58.420 --> 07:08.040
But Ted Sturgeon did a review, I believe it was for Amazing Stories, I could be
wrong, in which he said that this was probably one of the best, if not the best

07:08.040 --> 07:19.560
anthology that I had ever done. But, of course, I don't necessarily do an
anthology. I do a novel, because I am the one person writing that book. But I'm

07:19.560 --> 07:29.960
simply, in effect, a kind of hub of the wheel, and the writers are the spokes.
and it all works together because we're working in it together. So I consider

07:29.960 --> 07:42.820
Future City to be really a terrific book. And I'd say that without ego because I
was only, in a sense, a minor part of it. The writers wrote it. And that book

07:42.820 --> 07:55.560
also included poems and included some extremely outspoken stories, some
extremely violent stories. And so there was a good cross-section of styles, but

07:55.560 --> 08:10.140
chronologically and psychologically the anthology assumes that the city is a
dead quote thing unquote and the stories proceeded to out of that viewpoint You

08:10.140 --> 08:23.100
mentioned that one way you can look at this is as a novel Have you ever
attempted to write stories yourself or still plan to? Oh, I sold a story to uh,

08:24.040 --> 08:36.100
to Bob Silverberg for new dimensions four. It was, it's interesting. It's the,
it's so totally avant guard with sentence structure and the way the type is set

08:36.100 --> 08:45.780
on the stage. It's rather bizarre. I was somewhat influenced by so many stories
that I had bought from Barry Mossberg. I think I am Barry claims that I bought

08:45.780 --> 08:54.940
more stories from him than any other editor, more wordage, including the novels.
and his stories tend to be often bizarre in the best sense of the term as a

08:54.940 --> 09:03.600
Picasso painting might be considered bizarre if compared with another painter's
more traditional work. So this story was totally different from what people had

09:03.600 --> 09:16.300
expected of me and from me and it got a lot of good recognition. And then I did
several stories from my own anthologies which is not as nepotistic or incestuous

09:16.300 --> 09:25.060
as you might think Because what I did was I would send the story that I had
written to the publisher and said, look, is this good enough to include? If it

09:25.060 --> 09:34.380
isn't, I don't think either of us should touch it with the proverbial 10-foot
pole. And in three or four cases where I did stories for my own anthologies, the

09:34.380 --> 09:45.420
publisher said, fine, let's use it. So I did use it. But as far as my own
writing now, I'm principally writing nonfiction, and that nonfiction is

09:45.420 --> 09:57.720
principally comprised of interviews with TV and movie stars, with politicians,
with, for example, in October, I'm going to England and I'm going to be

09:57.720 --> 10:10.040
interviewing Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph Richardson, Sir Lawrence Olivier, and
so on, people of that caliber and quality in the acting field. and so most of my

10:10.040 --> 10:19.300
writing is in the area of personality profiling slash interviewing. I'm
presently editor-in-chief of a new national magazine. I don't want this to be a

10:19.300 --> 10:27.300
commercial, but I'm trying to ask your question in terms of my own writing now.
I'm editor-in-chief of a new national magazine entitled Person-to-Person, which

10:27.300 --> 10:37.340
the publisher is bringing out to compete with people. And the sole reason for
that magazine's existence is over the past 21 years I've been interviewing

10:37.340 --> 10:44.920
people, and I started interviewing celebrities, if you will, long before I got
into science fiction, and have now continued with it, now that I'm principally

10:44.920 --> 10:58.060
out of science fiction. The litany of complaints that I've heard over the last
20, 21 years has been really pretty bad. The average journalist may well

10:58.060 --> 11:08.600
consider the average celebrity to be fair game, and so many magazines, even
others, which should not be named for print or for telecast or broadcast, other

11:08.600 --> 11:23.300
magazines do not have an unbending philosophy of editorial integrity. They feel
it is all right to apparently misquote a star. They feel it is all right to tack

11:23.300 --> 11:35.220
on a scandal-ridden, misleading headline. And the person is geared toward real
integrity in journalism, checking material through a star, and this leads to the

11:35.220 --> 11:46.460
point that I am writing a book of all the material that appears, at least in the
first several issues of Person to Person, because I'm rather pig-headed about

11:46.460 --> 11:57.840
how it should be done. I feel the style should be of a certain type, the depth,
if you will, the interview, should be always consistent, little of anything that

11:57.840 --> 12:09.160
is superficial. And so I'm writing, oh, golly, it's 64-page magazine. I must be
writing 40 to 45 pages of it. Other writers include Armie Archard, who is a

12:09.160 --> 12:18.440
columnist for Daily Variety and interviews a number of the film stars prior to
the Academy Awards broadcast each year. So I'm doing that writing. Four years

12:18.440 --> 12:27.860
ago, I wrote a novel rather like, oh, I guess you could say in the Jonathan
Livingston Seagull genre, and that was called Soaring. that was strictly a work

12:27.860 --> 12:39.360
of fiction. I've written biographies of Nancy Reagan for Simon & Schuster back
in 76. Biographies of Pat and Shirley Boone. Collections of interviews that I've

12:39.360 --> 12:52.340
done. And I'm also getting into, I hope, pretty fair novelizations of different
TV shows. I just finished something based upon the spinoff from Happy Days, Joni

12:52.340 --> 13:05.380
Loachachachay. I'm finishing now Oh, Facts of Life novelization. I've also done
tie-ins, although not novelizations, with Dukes of Hazzard and Fantasy Island

13:05.380 --> 13:16.520
and so on. Sounds like you don't get bored. I don't. And I'll tell you, I'm
also, and I can't name them yet, I've just been appointed, and I hope I'm using

13:16.520 --> 13:26.060
the right title. If it's inaccurate, don't kill me, but it amounts to the same
thing in any event. entertainment editor for one of the oldest newspaper

13:26.060 --> 13:36.240
syndication services in the country beginning in a month or two and I have the
contract literally here and I'm signing it this weekend. By September, October

13:36.240 --> 13:48.300
we're going to be putting together a packet of entertainment-oriented materials
columns, articles, etc. and sending that to subscribing newspapers around the

13:48.300 --> 13:56.980
country with the notion that if you buy this packet you don't have to buy a
column from this service this from another it's going to be a complete

13:56.980 --> 14:08.780
entertainment package it's going to be called person to person and once again
it's going to have the editorial philosophy that every word is true every fact

14:08.780 --> 14:19.580
is accurate if there is something terribly outspoken in it it's not something
that we have made up it's something that celebrity has chosen to give for

14:19.580 --> 14:35.080
example Linda Blair, who was in The Exorcist in the sequel and a number of other
films, some years ago developed a problem with drugs, and that somewhat hampered

14:35.080 --> 14:43.460
her career, and she's making a comeback now, and she has never talked about this
in-depth before. So what we're going to be doing is an interview, which I'll be

14:43.460 --> 14:57.580
conducting with Linda, perceptively, lovingly, and hopefully with some attempt
to show how she got into this and why she's glad she's out. In other words, an

14:57.580 --> 15:06.120
attempt to do something, hopefully, of the depth and length of a Playboy
interview, and she has never talked about that before. I would intend it as a

15:06.120 --> 15:18.120
kind of message to young people around the country as to the problems of getting
involved with drugs. was was science fiction then just a phase that you passed

15:18.120 --> 15:31.360
through and now you it was a really long phase it lasted for ten years was it a
phase something that is ten year a decade long or is a phase some transitory

15:31.360 --> 15:42.940
thing I think of a phase as something somebody gets into for a year or two or
maybe three probably never four with me it lasted if you will ten years, rather

15:42.940 --> 15:56.580
than a phase which involves a mental image of something maybe capricious, I
would say it was a period in my career, not a phase. Let me, if I can, go back

15:56.580 --> 16:07.940
in those days then and ask a couple more questions about being an editor. When
you were editing science fiction anthologies, what kind of audience did you aim

16:07.940 --> 16:20.260
for? Were you trying to please yourself or some commercial stereotype that or
whatever you could aim for? Well basically although some people can fault my

16:20.260 --> 16:35.080
judgment or Bob Silverberg's or Marlowe and Allison's or whoever I basically
bought stories that I liked. I basically bought stories that I felt in some

16:35.080 --> 16:47.820
cases even if I didn't particularly like them if they were well written if they
had something to say if they were something that obviously the author felt

16:47.820 --> 17:03.620
sincerely uh i bought it anyway i bought some stories that i felt were
personally religiously morally or whatever uh offensive because i felt they said

17:03.620 --> 17:04.540
something worthwhile.

17:11.960 --> 17:19.440
You apparently really got to know the writers, and I gather from what you were
telling me about what you're doing now, you really, you apparently have a talent

17:19.440 --> 17:31.200
for acquiring a relationship with a lot of people. I would assume... Can I
interrupt? Sure. Let me use a different word. You don't acquire a relationship.

17:31.420 --> 17:41.240
Right. Because that implies that you're looking to acquire relationships. Right.
And if one acquires a relationship, one begins to think of relationships as

17:41.240 --> 17:55.080
acquiring a prize or a trophy or something. Well taken. I think relationships
develop, and what I would say is I am interested in relationships developing

17:55.080 --> 18:13.420
beyond purely the professional-slash-commercial implications, i.e., I will
interview star X, Y, or Z. The interview goes very well. The star will say, give

18:13.420 --> 18:20.280
me a buzz. We'll have lunch next week. I'll give the star a buzz. We have lunch
next week. The star will say, hey, I'd like to get you to meet a friend of mine.

18:20.520 --> 18:31.440
Boom, boom, boom. So it leads into that so that you do not, or rather, I enjoy
what I'm doing only superficially because of the money and only superficially

18:31.440 --> 18:42.380
because of the recognition. It really is coming quite heavily now. I enjoy what
I'm doing because of people. One mistake that I made in science fiction, which I

18:42.380 --> 18:56.140
am doing anything but making now, is that I conducted so much of my business by
phone. And this man back in New Jersey was always making phone calls and doing

18:56.140 --> 19:11.040
this and that. I was like the, you know, the unseen entrepreneur, if you will,
in the field. And people that didn't meet me tended to wonder what I was like

19:11.040 --> 19:22.720
and in some cases not like what they felt I was like. However, when you meet
people, they will obviously possibly dislike you. On the other hand, they may

19:22.720 --> 19:33.400
like you. And so I feel if I had anything at all to do over in the science
fiction field, I would have gone to conventions. I would have had parties of my

19:33.400 --> 19:46.020
own. I would have gotten out there more and mixed with people. Recently, I
became involved with Disney Studios in attending the science fiction convention

19:46.020 --> 19:56.060
scene and the comic book scene representing them and doing some preparatory work
in terms of publicizing Tron. It was like night and day. Even some authors,

19:56.400 --> 20:07.440
three or four, that I met at these conventions with whom I had had sometimes
vehement arguments over the phone, really boisterous name-calling, bad language

20:07.440 --> 20:17.020
on their part at least. I try not to fall into bad language, I'm sure I even
slipped, too. And these are really horrendous arguments. I meet these same

20:17.020 --> 20:27.880
people in person. We end up shaking hands. I even threw a pie in one of their
faces. Now, let me explain that. There was a stump the experts panel at one of

20:27.880 --> 20:37.180
the conventions. And I am kind of a movie trivia nut. So the idea is you're
supposed to ask one of the experts a question, which I did. They didn't have the

20:37.180 --> 20:46.180
answer. But they get a chance to ask you a question. and if you don't have the
answer, you don't get a pie in your face, but you also don't get the right to

20:46.180 --> 20:53.880
throw a pie in their face. So I asked the expert a question. He didn't know the
answer. He asked me a question. I knew the answer, and so I got to throw a pie

20:53.880 --> 21:04.940
in his face. So I threw a pie in the face of somebody with whom I had had
sometimes vicious arguments over the phone, and afterwards we went to a party

21:04.940 --> 21:14.780
together and were very friendly. So I think what people don't see in person, or
who people don't see in person, they either fear or they suspect that person's

21:14.780 --> 21:24.060
motives, because all they're hearing is this sometimes intruding voice over the
telephone. Out here, where I'm with celebrities, if you will, day and night, so

21:24.060 --> 21:34.680
to speak, I go to interviews five or six, sometimes seven, eight interviews a
week, most of them in person, sometimes they'll come to the house. I've thrown

21:34.680 --> 21:42.000
parties, for example, for a number of people. I won't use their names because
I'm not trying to capitalize on the parties. They weren't show business parties,

21:42.020 --> 21:49.920
but they were parties involving friends. And I've thrown a half a dozen of those
in the past year or so. And what I'm interested now are the personal

21:49.920 --> 22:01.940
relationships as much as possible. Was that an answer to your question? That's a
good answer, yeah. This is enjoyable. This is totally different than I expected.

22:02.240 --> 22:13.200
Now, what did you expect? No, I expected something great. It's just I didn't
realize you were so deeply involved in the popular entertainment scene. This is

22:13.200 --> 22:21.220
educational for me. Good. My wife will love it because she's quite interested in
this. If you ever come out to California, we'll introduce you to a few other

22:21.220 --> 22:33.260
studios. Okay, I may take you up on that and leave me. You mentioned a while ago
that when you were buying the science fiction stories, that you did buy some

22:33.260 --> 22:43.540
that you really didn't necessarily approve of, although you thought other people
would like them. No, no, no. I didn't say that I bought them because I thought

22:43.540 --> 22:55.320
people would like them. There can be a wonderful story that we all dislike, but
the author has said something worthwhile. And, you know, there are a number of

22:55.320 --> 23:03.980
stories I bought which maybe I liked and nobody else did, So I didn't
necessarily buy a story for people to like them. I bought stories because I felt

23:03.980 --> 23:09.000
they were good and hoped that people would like them. Okay.

23:11.960 --> 23:22.600
There have been critics in the past who have said that you censored things, that
sort of thing. Is that really true, or perhaps that's just a convenient word

23:22.600 --> 23:30.760
they can bring up because they didn't accept your story? Define the word for me
as you use it. Censored to me would mean that there was material included which

23:30.760 --> 23:43.220
was blue lined or cut out or whatever, and the story was used anyway, or it was
rejected solely for that content and not for literary content, let's say. That's

23:43.220 --> 23:53.960
just my interpretation. Okay, now I'm not trying to hedge, but I want to think
of instances and so forth. I wish I could be specific. I just remember reading

23:53.960 --> 24:05.900
through the years. If that's the way you use the word censored, yeah, I guess it
would crop up or it did crop up. But I don't use the word censored so much as

24:05.900 --> 24:17.740
exercise personal taste. Now, I think this question was brought up many years
ago. Yes. And my response to the author or the interviewer or the other editor

24:17.740 --> 24:27.220
or the publisher or whoever it was, or the fans who raised the question was, all
right, let me respond to that with a question. Would you publish a story,

24:29.860 --> 24:41.560
wonderfully written, artistically valid, well-plotted, believable characters,
interesting story that drew you into the action, and at the end you had to admit

24:41.560 --> 24:55.780
that it was just pure dynamite. Would you, however, publish such a story that
accused your mother of being a whore who gave birth to you illegitimately? And

24:55.780 --> 25:05.480
the writer says, no, of course, that would be personally insulting to somebody I
love. I said, for that same reason, I will not publish a story that defames God

25:05.480 --> 25:16.900
or Jesus Christ in any way. Or that defames my country. Or that defames my
parents, if you will. I would not publish a story for the very same reason. If I

25:16.900 --> 25:26.200
found a story, and there's a slight contradiction here, thinking back to what I
said earlier, I said earlier I might publish or I did publish stories that were

25:26.200 --> 25:38.760
personally offensive. It's on a case-by-case basis. I might find a story that
advocated something, whatever that something was, personally offensive. But I

25:38.760 --> 25:48.760
would not publish a story that ridiculed defamed my religion or, frankly,
anybody else's, because that would be a different type of offensive. I might

25:48.760 --> 26:00.260
agree that a person who advocated something certainly had the freedom to
advocate that, and I might not agree with it. I would publish it anyway if it

26:00.260 --> 26:09.500
were a good story. However, I think that there's too much, and this is another
reason why Person2Person exists, there's too much negative journalism, there's

26:09.500 --> 26:22.720
too much negative fiction, where anything goes under the guise of artistic
liberty. I would never advocate general censorship. Let's say this, I would

26:22.720 --> 26:36.300
never advocate institutionalized censorship. But an editor or a movie director
or whatever, they have the right, according to their personal views, to say,

26:36.460 --> 26:45.620
well, I like that and I'll publish it, or I like that and I'll produce it or
direct it. or I don't like it, and I won't publish it, and I don't like it, and

26:45.620 --> 26:56.900
I won't produce it or direct. They have that right to guide their project
according to their personal taste. You would never catch, for example, and I

26:56.900 --> 27:08.260
think I am surmising this properly, Alan Alda or Ed Asner producing a movie or a
TV show

27:11.160 --> 27:22.560
that presented a favorable picture of Ronald Reagan. They would find that
personally offensive. So are they exercising censorship when they're exercising

27:22.560 --> 27:35.020
their own personal taste? I don't think so. Thank you for that answer. That was
a hard question for me to ask. How did my answer say? It sounds great. I know

27:35.020 --> 27:44.980
now why when I said this interview was a surprise and I'm used to interviewing
science fiction authors and they never ask me questions. They don't make me

27:44.980 --> 27:56.820
define my terms. So, this is enjoyable. It doesn't feel like such a one way
street. Don't forget, I am an interviewer too. You're in trouble tonight. No, I

27:56.820 --> 28:06.860
need to learn a lot. I'm going to find out about you at night. Before we leave
anthologies, I want to ask one more question on it. Did you discover any new

28:06.860 --> 28:20.640
writers? Is that kind of... And if you did, is that kind of a high point of
being an editor? I would think it would be. It really is. Golly, discover. I did

28:20.640 --> 28:32.500
discover some. I think a better term with a bulk of the newer writers is that
rather than discover them, I helped, we're using the word properly, augment

28:32.500 --> 28:44.240
their career. or I augmented their careers. One writer who comes to mind is
Steve Golden. Steve, I think, has said in print and to me personally that I

28:44.240 --> 28:56.920
helped propel his career along. Did I discover, and I'm sure that other editors
or anthologists published Steve before I did, but I gave him, I think, in terms

28:56.920 --> 29:06.640
of novels and short stories, a real, his career, rather, a real impetus and
probably did something to help him. In Barry Malsberg's case, he certainly was

29:06.640 --> 29:18.180
around with Beyond Apollo and others long before, well, maybe not so long, but
before I came on the scene so energetically. But I bought more articles, not

29:18.180 --> 29:31.360
sorry, more short stories and more novels from Barry than any other single
editor and probably did something major or minor, negligible or significant to

29:31.360 --> 29:42.560
help up-establish him more than he had been but oh there were some writers i
discovered golly uh i think there was one writer named j.j russ who wrote a very

29:42.560 --> 29:52.920
good story kind of a story which was a commentary on pornography and striptease
artist uh and then there were so many others that i may have bought one story

29:52.920 --> 30:02.660
from and maybe didn't buy any others and maybe nobody ever heard from them So
when you say discover a writer, that implies that you found a Hemingway, or you

30:02.660 --> 30:13.540
found another writer of similar stature, an Irving Stone or someone, and from
that moment of beginning, they went on to great things. I can't honestly say

30:13.540 --> 30:24.540
that I was responsible in that way for discovering a writer, if that's how you
apply the word discover. I want to move on now to Laser Books, the Laser series

30:24.540 --> 30:36.280
which you edited, How did you get involved in that? How did that get started?
Well, I read in Publishers Weekly an interview with the president of the

30:36.280 --> 30:48.720
company, Harlequin Enterprises Limited, an interview with Larry Heisey, and he
seemed to be suggesting, perhaps between the lines, that they would love to do

30:48.720 --> 30:59.040
books beyond simply the romance field in which they had been until that time and
still are a leader, or THE leader, rather. They have tens of millions of books

30:59.040 --> 31:12.240
every year. And so I thought I would call up Heise, and I did, and got through
reasonably quickly and indicated to him the science fiction field and movies

31:12.240 --> 31:21.680
that were coming out that would help give the popularity of science fiction a
real foundation, a continuing foundation. And he said, send me a letter. I'd

31:21.680 --> 31:29.000
love to talk to you about it. So I sent him, apparently, a persuasive letter,
and he called me up a few days later. I remember at that time I was living in

31:29.000 --> 31:37.580
New Jersey, so it wasn't such a chore to get to New York. It was a two-hour or
so drive, whether I drove or went by bus. And he said, I'm really interested.

31:37.780 --> 31:46.680
Why don't you meet me at this and such hotel? So I did, and we had a further
meeting, and then they paid for me to come up to Toronto, Canada, and I met with

31:46.680 --> 31:56.180
their board of directors and all, their salespeople. It was really a very nice
meeting. So they decided a week or two later to get into science fiction via

31:56.180 --> 32:09.200
Laser Books. And I've talked with the people, the new people at Harlequin since
then, since Laser Books failed, and all sorts of postmortems on the situation.

32:09.200 --> 32:20.580
But I would say if I have any bitterness, and somebody observed about me
recently that I don't hold any grudges, but I am human, so there is a residue of

32:20.580 --> 32:31.760
bitterness. or regret, maybe regret more than business, is that, well, Harlequin
had the money to do the books properly, and when I say money to do the books

32:31.760 --> 32:44.400
properly, publicized them, distribute them, et cetera. Where it fell short is
everything, and this is not a mean criticism of Harlequin because they're

32:44.400 --> 32:54.900
awfully nice people. It may be a negative criticism, but it's not meant meanly
in any way. uh they fell short because every book had to fit into a formula that

32:54.900 --> 33:07.640
they developed certain length certain type of story uh always a male protagonist
the cover design had to be ostensibly at least always the same design so it was

33:07.640 --> 33:23.160
this formula and what i found myself facing, was if I had a fair book by a
writer that fit the formula, and a really good book by a writer that was maybe

33:23.160 --> 33:38.920
off in one or two possibly even minor points, I had to buy the book that was
fair and reject the book that was quite good. A perfect case is a writer, golly

33:38.920 --> 33:49.720
I must be getting old, whose name I forget. She's a female writer. She wrote a
book that fit the Harlequin approach to laser books in every way. Action

33:49.720 --> 34:04.120
adventure. Upbeat ending. No profanity. No blatant sex. I mean, it went right on
down the line. And where it fell short, instead of having the principal

34:04.120 --> 34:20.260
protagonist, a guy, it was a woman and so therefore it had to be rejected but it
was so good. And what I got tarred and run out of town for you might say is oh

34:20.260 --> 34:29.420
golly, so many of the books are only fair or mediocre but that's unfortunately
the way it turned out.

34:32.320 --> 34:44.240
So it was Harlequin who more or less set the editorial policy that you had to
follow. It was dictated to you. Totally. Now, again, hindsight not doing anybody

34:44.240 --> 34:56.920
one bit of good. If I had it to do over again, famous words, might as well not
be said for all the good they do, but if I had it to do over again, I would have

34:56.920 --> 35:09.820
been much more pig-headed not only at the beginning, but later, and I would have
said, all right, if you want me to buy the mediocre book, fine, but you do

35:09.820 --> 35:24.080
really want to be known for a series of mediocre books? I said, because in the
science fiction field, interestingly enough, the commercial route is the route

35:24.080 --> 35:34.520
that you want to follow, and that is best achieved if you publish good books and
if you publish books that have some divergence of style and plotting and so

35:34.520 --> 35:45.480
forth. Because the science fiction field, more than the western field, more than
the detective or mystery field, responds negatively to the routine and the

35:45.480 --> 35:56.400
pedestrian and the predictable. It may work in the romance field. It may work
in, and mind you, your books are great within the limitations of the genre. But

35:56.400 --> 36:05.840
the science fiction genre, by its very nature, is an unfettered genre where you
can go to the moon, you can go to the stars, you can go inside the earth, you

36:05.840 --> 36:15.220
can go back in time, you can go forward in time, you can do so many things. The
beauty of the genre is that you have no real limitations in that respect. So

36:15.220 --> 36:27.400
what you want to do is superimpose a formula of limitations on an unformulized
novel, genre, if there's any such a word as unformulized, I said it's going to

36:27.400 --> 36:38.360
be deaf eventually, but frankly it was a good contract, they were exceptionally
nice people, and it was a very enticing situation that I wouldn't, I really

36:38.360 --> 36:51.740
would not duplicate again. If a publisher, Harlequin or whoever, and I were in
touch again, I would want virtually total editorial autonomy

36:54.880 --> 37:08.780
within previously agreed parameters. There has to be parameters of some sort. I
mean, no publisher will let and shouldn't let an editor publish three novels of

37:08.780 --> 37:17.900
1,000 pages a piece every month. I mean, there have to be some financial or
other limitations. But within those parameters, I would want total editorial

37:17.900 --> 37:26.580
integrity. That's the way I would do it again because that doesn't do any good
now. What kind of audience did the Harlequin people have visualize for the Laser

37:26.580 --> 37:40.880
Series? That's tougher. I think, well, this was covered at one convention I did
attend, and I didn't attend very many, as I said to my regret. The fan of

37:40.880 --> 37:55.660
science fiction who felt that there was too much quirkiness getting into the
genre, There is too much blatant sexuality getting into the genre, and that the

37:55.660 --> 38:07.940
science fiction at its best is the science fiction epitomized by Hugo Gernsback,
John W. Campbell. By the way, let me add parenthetically that John W. Campbell,

38:08.100 --> 38:22.240
if he was a dictator, was far more of a censor-wielding dictator than I ever
was, but the science fiction epitomized by Campbell and Gernsback in a more

38:22.240 --> 38:33.780
poetic sense by Ray Bradbury and so on, you would not really catch, you would
not really have caught Gernsback or Campbell publishing anything that was even,

38:33.900 --> 38:47.060
I guess, remotely sexually suggestive. You certainly would not catch Ray
Bradbury publishing, quote, an offensive story. and so I felt that I fit more

38:47.060 --> 38:58.480
and I've been compared to that mold than in any other type and I just lost track
of your question. Me too. Oh yeah okay for what audience? I think you answered

38:58.480 --> 39:08.100
it the first sentence really but what audience was it intended? That audience
the classical ah okay perfect example the audience that responded with such

39:08.100 --> 39:24.040
energy to Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, Close Encounters, and now E.T. Not the
audience which would have responded to some dark, perverse, sexually explicit

39:24.040 --> 39:36.740
kind of material. Okay. That series did fail. Yes. Did it fail, and I assume
that that means financially, did it really lose money or did it just not make as

39:36.740 --> 39:48.620
much money as Harlequin wanted it to? Well, I am told, and I have nothing
concrete in my hand right now to validify this in any way, but I was told,

39:48.740 --> 40:01.220
hearsay and bond and all, what I was told was this. The Harlequin books sold as
well at the time as the average doll book and maybe even the average beast book.

40:01.220 --> 40:17.840
But Harlequin used to 100,000 copies per book, 200,000, maybe even 300,000, was
not content with 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 copies. Okay, yeah. Don Walheim told us

40:17.840 --> 40:28.840
that, I think he said, that 30,000 books was what was required for a doll book
to break even. Yep. So, I guess 50,000 is money in his pocket. Yes, and also

40:28.840 --> 40:40.200
Harlequin did spend a lot of money advertising the books. And, you know, it's
interesting. A number of the authors, seven, eight, ten, however many, have told

40:40.200 --> 40:50.680
me subsequent to the suspension of publication of Laser Books that over the
following six months to a year after the books were suspended, they were getting

40:50.680 --> 40:58.540
royally checked. I think one writer got, beyond his original advance, of course,
one writer was surprised to open up an envelope from Harlequin one day and find

40:58.540 --> 41:11.980
a check for $1,100. The authors certainly didn't lose money. Quite a number of
the authors got additional royalties, but it just wasn't successful enough for

41:11.980 --> 41:21.160
Harlequin to continue. This is something that's a hearsay or it's an impression
that's been built up over the years reading about that situation. but I

41:21.160 --> 41:36.460
understand that perhaps the Harlequin people didn't realize that people buy
science fiction authors and they buy some author, a famous author, they'll buy a

41:36.460 --> 41:44.040
Frank Herbert, whereas if they see an unknown, they won't buy that book. And
they assumed that the science fiction people would buy the book just because it

41:44.040 --> 41:54.980
was science fiction. Well, I would tend more to agree, oh, golly, we're going in
three directions there. We're saying they'll buy the book because it's science

41:54.980 --> 42:03.700
fiction, they'll buy the book because it's a name author, and they won't buy the
book because it's an unknown author. Well, I disagree with the fact that they

42:03.700 --> 42:15.500
won't buy the book because it's an unknown author. I'll get that out. An unknown
author. Steve Golden at the time with his other books was quasi-unknown. And

42:15.500 --> 42:27.100
there were so many authors who weren't extremely well-known, such as Ray Nelson,
such as others. And those books sold better than any of the other Harlequin

42:27.100 --> 42:39.320
books. Certainly, Jerry Parnell sold well, but at the time, he hadn't really had
the $100,000 successes that he's having today. So I would disagree with the fact

42:39.320 --> 42:51.140
that if a book is presented well, and this was in those days, maybe today it's a
little more sophisticated, a little more selective, better word, I think if the

42:51.140 --> 43:02.280
book looked appealing, the author was not necessarily the deciding factor.
Obviously, though, if we'd had Philip K. Dick and Paul Anderson and Bob

43:02.280 --> 43:13.660
Silverberg and so on write for us, The sales would have been better. But even
so, I remember talking to Bob Silverberg about one of his books. It was with

43:13.660 --> 43:25.460
Signet, New American Library. If I recall properly, it had gone through two
printings. And by the end of the second printing, had sold the grand total, over

43:25.460 --> 43:39.360
a period of X number of years, had sold the grand total of 80,000 copies. Well,
that's Bob Silverberg. I doubt that Harlequin would have been satisfied waiting

43:39.360 --> 43:52.740
X number of years for a book to sell one-half or one-third or one-quarter of
what the average romance book sold in six months. Okay. I got you. It's just a

43:52.740 --> 44:01.320
matter of perspective, really. Okay. Tell you what, let me change my tape. Let
me get a glass of water, and I will be right back. Okay, great. Thank you.
