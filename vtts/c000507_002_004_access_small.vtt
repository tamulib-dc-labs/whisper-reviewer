Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.460 --> 00:33.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.100
And here are your hosts.

00:42.920 --> 00:43.960
This is Daryl Lane.

00:44.220 --> 00:44.860
And David Cruz.

00:45.420 --> 00:50.120
Almost with the publication of her first novel in 1976, C.J. Cherry became one of the most

00:50.120 --> 00:51.940
popular science fiction writers working today.

00:52.340 --> 00:54.080
That first novel was Gate of Iveril.

00:54.460 --> 00:58.720
Cherry added two more books to make it a trilogy, Well of Shuan and Fires of Azeroth.

00:58.940 --> 01:02.800
And for Well of Shuan, she was given the John W. Campbell Award as the best new writer of

01:02.800 --> 01:03.080
the year.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.740
Cherry has published some 15 novels since 1976, a very quick pace.

01:08.360 --> 01:12.480
Some of her better known books include The Fated Sun Trilogy, Brothers of Earth, Down

01:12.480 --> 01:15.460
Below Station, The Pride of Channer, and Hunter of Worlds.

01:15.860 --> 01:19.160
In 1978 she won a Hugo Award for the short story Cassandra.

01:19.620 --> 01:22.420
We asked Cherry if she'd been reading science fiction since childhood.

01:22.420 --> 01:28.700
Yes, I started reading science fiction, I suppose, about the earliest form of literature

01:28.700 --> 01:29.460
that I read.

01:29.980 --> 01:39.140
I never made a mental distinction between science fiction and fantasy, anything of that

01:39.140 --> 01:46.380
nature because my parents brought it to me to read and I just simply regarded it as the

01:46.380 --> 01:49.780
most interesting reading material that I had accessible.

01:51.240 --> 01:56.980
So naturally when I began turning to writing that's what I wrote.

01:58.020 --> 02:00.680
She went on to tell us why she decided to start writing science fiction.

02:01.780 --> 02:04.620
Actually they took my television program off the air.

02:06.940 --> 02:09.820
Our television at that time I was ten.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.200
Television hadn't been around in private homes very long.

02:13.840 --> 02:19.440
I had just time enough to get thoroughly addicted to television science fiction and then it

02:19.440 --> 02:21.880
ran its course and it was gone from the air.

02:22.200 --> 02:28.740
So I, in a fit of mourning, went into the bedroom, picked up a tablet and pencil and

02:28.740 --> 02:30.140
started writing my own novels.

02:31.740 --> 02:34.440
Cherry is a talented writer with a flair for style and structure.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.800
She might have been successful in any form of writing she chose to pursue.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.180
She tells us why she didn't write other kinds of books.

02:41.060 --> 02:44.060
Why I didn't write the other things because I didn't like them.

02:44.520 --> 02:52.920
In general I find that, I suppose the only thing outside of science fiction that I've

02:52.920 --> 02:55.020
ever tried in my hand at writing has been mysteries.

02:56.720 --> 03:04.440
And I don't care for the modern fashion of those and I've always viewed them as a great

03:04.440 --> 03:06.580
deal more fun to read than they are to write.

03:07.720 --> 03:15.500
Mostly because you have to be extremely controlled and I suspect that mystery writers have to

03:15.500 --> 03:20.080
know who did it and I'd rather not know the end of my books.

03:22.800 --> 03:29.220
The other thing that I've tried my hand at is historical fiction and I find again that's

03:29.220 --> 03:33.280
a straight jacket because you're rather well held with what's happened whether or not it

03:33.280 --> 03:34.420
makes artistic sense.

03:36.100 --> 03:40.160
So just for the sheer pleasure of writing I prefer science fiction.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.420
Donald Walheim, the owner and editor of Daw Books, discovered Cherry when she sent him

03:45.420 --> 03:46.860
the manuscript for Gate of Ivrel.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.080
She explains why she picked Walheim.

03:50.060 --> 03:58.540
I grew fascinated with Walheim as an editor because I had gone through my library finally

03:58.540 --> 04:02.980
after seven years of trying to sell things and I thought well there must be a system

04:02.980 --> 04:03.680
to this.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.860
I had no professional help at all.

04:06.940 --> 04:13.620
And I began searching my library to see what editor had published the majority of works

04:13.620 --> 04:17.960
and writers that I liked figuring that we might have something in common as far as taste

04:17.960 --> 04:18.400
goes.

04:19.200 --> 04:30.660
So I began researching Donald Walheim to see what his preferences were, where we differed

04:30.660 --> 04:31.560
and where we were similar.

04:32.400 --> 04:38.380
And so I began to conclude more and more that we were fairly well syntactical when it came

04:38.380 --> 04:39.800
to taste.

04:40.180 --> 04:45.080
Not quite the same all the way down the line but generally there's a broad area of overlap.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.880
So I found it very easy to work with.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.800
We'll have more with C.J. Cherry next time.

04:59.460 --> 05:03.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:03.780 --> 05:07.980
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.960
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.560 --> 06:17.880
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:17.880 --> 06:22.180
And here are your hosts.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.000
This is David Cruz.

06:28.240 --> 06:28.840
And Daryl Lane.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.720
C.J. Cherry published her first novel, Gate of Ivrel, in 1976.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.220
It was well received.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.080
Cherry quickly built up a following of readers and was acknowledged as one of the best new

06:38.080 --> 06:38.740
writers around.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.900
The popularity of Gate of Ivrel was one reason Cherry wrote two others on the same subject

06:43.900 --> 06:44.720
to form a trilogy.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.440
The second book was well as she won and the third fires of Azeroth.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.440
The trilogy is exciting heroic fantasy that takes place on an alien world.

06:52.860 --> 06:56.520
There are two main characters, Morgaine, a beautiful woman who wields a magic sword,

06:56.940 --> 06:59.920
and Vanya, a man who is vowed to help her in a difficult task.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.980
Morgaine's task is to destroy a space-time gate left on Vanya's world.

07:04.580 --> 07:08.140
The gate is a still functioning artifact left by a vanished race, the call.

07:08.820 --> 07:13.700
The gate can be used to travel in time or space, transporting anyone who enters it to

07:13.700 --> 07:15.080
other places and times.

07:15.580 --> 07:19.060
But the gate and others like it on other planets is a danger to the universe.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.320
That sounds like science fiction, but it's not.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.180
The story occurs on a primitive planet with no technology.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.820
Vanya and his people regard the gate as an object of magic and superstitiously avoid it.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.780
They also consider Morgaine as an evil sorceress.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.480
Her knowledge of technology to them is simply mysterious magic.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.900
So the novel is fantasy.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.980
The fighting is done with swords and transportation is by horse.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.040
Much of Cherry's later writing is straight science fiction, with a large amount of hard

07:44.040 --> 07:44.680
science in it.

07:44.980 --> 07:46.860
We asked her why she started out with fantasy.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.180
Well, I didn't.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.460
They weren't the first books that I had written.

07:54.860 --> 07:56.820
There are others which are...

07:59.000 --> 08:03.200
...attentive efforts that didn't tan out in one way or another.

08:03.340 --> 08:03.680
Everybody.

08:04.580 --> 08:09.540
I won't say everybody, but a majority of writers tend to have them.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.380
My first love is really technology.

08:13.100 --> 08:20.580
The only thing is that I had been out of the technological mainstream while they had

08:22.120 --> 08:25.860
made numerous scientific advances that I was not current with.

08:26.520 --> 08:33.360
And it annoys me a great deal to feel that I'm writing something that is not technically

08:33.360 --> 08:34.000
accurate.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.020
Or that I have glossed over something.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.460
It irritates me personally to postulate, well, for instance, we have a gravity field here

08:46.460 --> 08:48.120
which keeps everyone's feet on the deck.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.200
I want to know how it works.

08:51.140 --> 08:58.640
So, consequently, I wrote heroic fantasy while I was doing a great deal of reading in scientific

08:58.640 --> 08:59.180
American.

08:59.960 --> 09:06.900
Also, heroic fantasy is an area where I have a good deal of expertise since I have a major

09:08.160 --> 09:13.500
in classic history, archaeology, anthropology, this sort of thing.

09:14.180 --> 09:20.000
But I had always been a sort of a hobbyist in the...and a little more than a hobbyist

09:20.000 --> 09:22.360
since it was one of my fields in the history of technology.

09:24.020 --> 09:27.600
Throughout the three books, we learn very little about the background of Morgane.

09:27.860 --> 09:32.180
We ask Jerry if perhaps Morgane is a force or a creature who existed even before the

09:32.180 --> 09:33.700
call, the builders of the gates.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.320
Well, actually, now there's some of this that I'm not about to give away as regards to the

09:40.320 --> 09:45.940
history of Morgane because that it gets into the possibility of a book that I'm working

09:45.940 --> 09:46.700
on at the moment.

09:47.280 --> 09:53.820
The first set of the books, the gate books, involve much more the character of Vanya who

09:53.820 --> 09:54.980
is a medieval man.

09:56.260 --> 10:02.280
I have to take his viewpoint or they cease to be heroic fantasy and they begin to be

10:02.280 --> 10:07.540
a science fiction novel pure and simple because Morgane is far more technologically sophisticated

10:08.400 --> 10:13.360
than he is and if it were told from her viewpoint it would begin to be a thing of numbers and

10:13.360 --> 10:13.820
calculus.

10:16.900 --> 10:21.920
Morgane is far more advanced exactly where she comes from and what she is, I've preferred

10:21.920 --> 10:30.720
to leave to the reader's estimation although I will say that your surmises are fairly well

10:30.720 --> 10:31.340
down the center.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.760
We'll talk with CJ Cherry about some of her other books next time.

10:43.120 --> 10:47.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

10:47.420 --> 10:51.640
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:42.980 --> 11:46.900
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:02.680 --> 12:07.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:10.620 --> 12:12.220
And here are your hosts.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.080
This is Daryl Lane.

12:18.260 --> 12:18.940
And David Cruz.

12:18.940 --> 12:23.880
CJ Cherry's 1982 novel, The Pride of Channer, is a fascinating depiction of alien cultures.

12:24.440 --> 12:28.660
Essentially there's only one human in the entire book, a wretched man named Tully who's

12:28.660 --> 12:30.920
been picked up after an accident aboard his spaceship.

12:31.260 --> 12:33.180
The aliens who end up with him are called the honey.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.760
We are with the honey for the length of the novel, seeing everything from their alien

12:36.760 --> 12:37.320
perspective.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.520
The honey look and act like lions.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.320
We asked Cherry if this was deliberate.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.300
Yes, absolutely.

12:44.740 --> 12:54.680
This is one case where I've taken the species of lions and in a very simple way devised a

12:54.680 --> 13:04.800
culture of an advanced species which very closely parallels the biology and if you will,

13:04.900 --> 13:07.180
social patterns of a lion's pride.

13:10.920 --> 13:15.200
As an alert reader soon figures out, there is a three way pun on the title of Pride

13:15.200 --> 13:15.620
of Channer.

13:16.220 --> 13:16.960
Pride of lions?

13:17.560 --> 13:19.440
The pride characteristic of the honey species?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.740
In the name of the honey spaceship which is called the Pride of Channer.

13:23.420 --> 13:27.880
Tully, the human who falls into honey hands and gets mixed up in an interstellar war, is

13:27.880 --> 13:30.280
a pitiful creature who both fears and needs the honey.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.880
Cherry explains why he instinctively fears the lion like species.

13:33.880 --> 13:38.340
Have you ever seen a baboon react to a leopard?

13:40.340 --> 13:41.980
It's raw terror.

13:43.020 --> 13:48.060
A primate nervous system is not really set up to be setting in the center of a pride of

13:48.060 --> 13:48.360
lions.

13:50.100 --> 13:54.660
It's really one of the most unkind things I believe that you could do to a human being

13:54.660 --> 14:00.460
as far as social patterns would be to drop them right into the middle of a feline culture.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.300
Because the moves are all wrong.

14:06.940 --> 14:16.120
Well for instance, Tully being a primate smiles and of course this is exactly the wrong thing

14:16.120 --> 14:16.440
to do.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.240
You know what a lion does when it smiles.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.680
It's not a friendly gesture.

14:21.580 --> 14:23.580
Every gesture he makes is wrong.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.080
In his own way though Cherry says Tully acts with courage.

14:34.980 --> 14:41.520
He is however a very heroic human being if you just simply analyze what he has done.

14:42.780 --> 14:47.220
He has managed to survive a very horrendous situation.

14:48.060 --> 14:53.200
He has managed to collect himself with some dignity out of a situation which would have

14:53.200 --> 14:54.200
broken drastically.

14:55.700 --> 15:00.160
Any average individual would have definitely come out of it damaged.

15:01.600 --> 15:08.180
He's been forced to take horrendous decisions and he's been dumped into a situation where

15:09.200 --> 15:12.540
even his personal value is of some question.

15:14.400 --> 15:23.760
Yet he manages to stand up on his signed feet and confront the honey captain with a here I am

15:23.760 --> 15:27.540
come and see if you can do something about it kind of attitude which is of course what

15:27.540 --> 15:31.440
wins the captain's respect in the beginning.

15:32.480 --> 15:38.420
He calms down a little bit as you will see when he begins trying to deal with them doing

15:38.420 --> 15:45.560
what any sensible person would do when confronted with a situation where you suspect that the

15:46.000 --> 15:51.820
beings around you are at least essentially friendly and there's no need provoking something

15:53.460 --> 15:55.960
that would be a total misunderstanding.

15:56.960 --> 16:04.800
So he does remain a little bit quiet but he's quiet partially because he's smart and is

16:04.800 --> 16:08.940
trying to absorb more data than he gets out.

16:10.620 --> 16:15.180
The Pride of Channer is a typical CJ Cherry narrative well plotted with finely drawn alien

16:15.180 --> 16:17.880
cultures and full of exciting and realistic space battles.

16:18.220 --> 16:19.940
And that's what we come to expect from Cherry.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.180
She doesn't seem to know how to write a bad book.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.400
More with CJ Cherry on our next show.

16:31.460 --> 16:36.320
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:36.320 --> 16:40.140
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

16:54.400 --> 17:24.380
We'll be back with another episode of the Science Fiction Radio Show.

17:28.620 --> 17:32.800
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:48.440 --> 17:53.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.000
And here are your hosts.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.700
This is David Cruz.

18:03.940 --> 18:04.520
And Daryl Lane.

18:04.860 --> 18:09.760
One of the finest science fiction trilogies in recent years is CJ Cherry's Fated Sun series.

18:10.100 --> 18:14.820
It was published in the late 1970s under the titles Kesrith, Changer and Kutoth.

18:15.280 --> 18:19.080
There are few books in science fiction that present an alien culture with the sensitivity

18:19.080 --> 18:23.660
and depth that Cherry has given to one of the alien races in the trilogy, the Murray.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.220
The Murray are nomadic tribesmen of the desert.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.680
They are great warriors and space-faring races employ them as mercenaries.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.100
Cherry says she didn't pattern the Murray on any modern nomadic cultures,

18:33.260 --> 18:35.060
but she used her knowledge of ancient history.

18:36.260 --> 18:40.620
When I did the Fated Sun novels, which are basically a desert culture,

18:40.820 --> 18:47.200
I did not pattern it off any modern desert culture about which I know, frankly, nothing.

18:48.200 --> 18:54.260
I patterned it strictly by taking what I know about desert survival.

18:56.040 --> 19:11.120
And earlier nomadic cultures here on earth contrived a biology that would work under the extreme conditions that I postulated.

19:11.700 --> 19:15.200
And then grew elements from here and there.

19:16.220 --> 19:25.400
It's very strange that I now get letters from people that say that it very closely resembles a modern terrestrial nomadic culture.

19:26.380 --> 19:29.000
But this is strictly a surprise to me.

19:29.180 --> 19:34.660
I suppose it just says that I knew something about the very ancient one.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.300
We asked Cherry what she most admired about the Murray.

19:39.300 --> 19:49.580
I think that for one thing, about the Murray, I think I admire their steadfastness,

19:50.600 --> 20:02.380
their ability to face time itself with tranquility in the sense that they can take the long view,

20:03.060 --> 20:10.300
which is a thing that is absolutely necessary in my mind for civilized survival.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.700
Mind, I don't say just survival, but civilized survival.

20:14.440 --> 20:20.240
Is there ability to look down the centuries and see consequences?

20:22.940 --> 20:25.480
The Murray sense of time is a very strange thing.

20:26.100 --> 20:35.660
The Murray always lives now, and that now is a composite of the past, current events, and the future simultaneously.

20:37.200 --> 20:46.320
They do not view time as the modern American does, which is more or less a set of beads on the string

20:46.320 --> 20:50.980
that we can snip off any tail of the string that seems inconvenient to us.

20:51.700 --> 20:55.300
The Murray concept of the universe is holistic.

20:56.480 --> 21:03.560
The Murray have almost been wiped out because they've been used as pawns in an interstellar war between humans and another alien culture, the Regal.

21:04.020 --> 21:07.840
Duncan, a human who's been partly responsible for the Murray's seemingly certain demise,

21:08.360 --> 21:11.580
is conscious stricken at the possible end of such a beautiful and ancient culture.

21:12.080 --> 21:17.600
His solution is to attempt to become a Murray, although it may kill him and will certainly destroy his humanity.

21:18.480 --> 21:34.240
His final sacrifice in a sort of a redemptive sense is that he finally agrees that he will no longer attempt to be human.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.400
He begins to try to be something else.

21:38.220 --> 21:43.880
Even in that there is a considerable hazard, because if the transition is not complete,

21:43.880 --> 21:51.700
he may end up by contaminating the culture, which to the Murray and their way of life is a very, very serious thing.

21:52.120 --> 22:00.220
But it is a voluntary and conscious decision that is effectively at his personal suicide.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.020
And he takes it because he feels responsible for what has happened.

22:07.980 --> 22:13.020
Duncan's attempt to become a Murray is one of the most sensitive treatments of human-alien contact in science fiction.

22:13.020 --> 22:15.720
We'll have more with C.J. Cherry on our next program.

22:23.120 --> 22:28.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:28.780 --> 22:31.680
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:16.080 --> 23:20.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:35.880 --> 23:41.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:44.020 --> 23:45.460
And here are your hosts.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.280
This is Daryl Lane.

23:51.540 --> 23:52.140
And David Cruz.

23:52.600 --> 23:57.400
Hunter of Worlds, a 1977 novel by C.J. Cherry, is a different sort of science fiction book,

23:57.780 --> 23:59.760
a difficult one that surprised a few of its readers.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.660
Cherry has created a language for one of the alien cultures in the novel,

24:03.920 --> 24:07.340
and the narrative is sprinkled with strange words that slow a reader down.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.600
Cherry admits that Hunter of Worlds is different from other works.

24:12.180 --> 24:18.660
Hunter of Worlds is constructed for different reasons.

24:18.760 --> 24:24.660
Usually when I use alien languages in a book, it is not for local color.

24:24.880 --> 24:30.100
It's just that when you run across anybody's civilization, which is vastly different than your own,

24:30.120 --> 24:35.960
you're going to come across three or four words which cannot be translated no matter how you would like to.

24:36.920 --> 24:42.580
It's just that not all languages have words for concepts.

24:44.940 --> 24:48.920
Well, you know, like in English, you can take several things that you can say,

24:49.060 --> 24:51.060
that you can't say in French and vice versa,

24:52.660 --> 24:58.160
which is why language borrows words from other languages.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.620
When I did Hunter of Worlds, I was doing something totally different,

25:01.620 --> 25:05.120
and it is an experimental novel, and it is not a novel,

25:05.180 --> 25:12.820
but I recommend it to someone who is not used to science fiction or not used to language one or the other.

25:14.040 --> 25:18.020
Basically on that one, the very premise of the book is linguistics,

25:19.720 --> 25:29.780
treating the science of linguistics as you will, as seriously as you treat physics in a science fiction novel.

25:31.260 --> 25:37.000
I deliberately set out to make a language which is not based on any earthly model.

25:37.600 --> 25:48.380
I even changed the rules of grammar to something that as far as I know is not directly based on any grammatical system on the face of the Earth.

25:50.060 --> 25:56.740
The thing is explained in an appendix in the back for people who wish to do this kind of thing.

25:57.700 --> 26:00.080
Cherry has some advice for those who read the novel.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.060
There are several ways to read the book.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.640
The recommendment is as the viewpoint character sees it.

26:10.520 --> 26:14.720
Frankly, the viewpoint character is confused, all get out most of the time.

26:14.980 --> 26:22.720
He doesn't understand, so you can equally well appreciate the book simply by realizing that from his viewpoint,

26:22.720 --> 26:27.560
a lot of these people are speaking things that he in no wise comprehends.

26:28.540 --> 26:34.960
The trouble with the book is that of course at several points he's vastly mistaken about what he thinks he understands.

26:36.740 --> 26:47.980
So the book does have some pitfalls in it for somebody who is accustomed to believing everything

26:47.980 --> 26:52.540
that the hero in a novel believes must ergo be the truth.

26:53.380 --> 27:02.820
Because he is very, very frequently mistaken or very, very frequently takes up a concept which is not the whole concept

27:02.820 --> 27:11.920
and gradually begins to arrive at an understanding of what's going on toward the end of the book.

27:11.920 --> 27:18.280
But I must warn everyone that even at the end he is somewhat mistaken.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.340
Cherry says she has a special affection for the novel.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.760
Kind of worlds.

27:26.840 --> 27:33.760
I like, I think partly because it's a kind of book that I wanted to write and I got away with it.

27:33.760 --> 27:43.600
Don Walheim was very, very understanding in that department because I think many editors would have come and said,

27:43.780 --> 27:46.680
well yes, but no one will understand those words.

27:46.820 --> 27:50.340
You've got to change them to English and that would have defeated the entire purpose of the book.

27:52.520 --> 28:00.820
And that one is sort of one of the very, very strange books that I can reread and find something I didn't know was there.

28:00.820 --> 28:03.340
It's just kind of an odd feeling.

28:04.780 --> 28:05.360

28:10.700 --> 28:16.360
