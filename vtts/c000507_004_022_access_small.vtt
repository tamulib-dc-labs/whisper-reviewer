00:01.460 --> 00:04.480
Okay, we're rolling for just the last few questions, I guess.

00:06.660 --> 00:11.940
Okay, another thing that you've worked with in your career in science fiction is President

00:11.940 --> 00:13.640
of the Science Fiction Writers of America.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.460
What are your feelings about that?

00:16.580 --> 00:17.820
Do you think that has a useful function?

00:18.440 --> 00:23.340
I think that professional organizations have a considerable bunch, I mean all of them,

00:23.360 --> 00:24.980
not just the Science Fiction Writers of America.

00:25.680 --> 00:31.140
I think they also divert an awful lot of energy that could better be used in some other

00:31.140 --> 00:34.960
way but I don't see how to have them and have the benefits without having as well as.

00:35.540 --> 00:41.900
At the moment, I'm also, I've just recently become the president of a thing called World

00:41.900 --> 00:46.700
SF which is an international organization of people who are professionally connected

00:46.700 --> 00:47.640
with science fiction.

00:48.120 --> 00:53.560
They had a meeting in Italy last summer and I couldn't go there.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.980
While I wasn't looking, they elected me president, so I'm stuck with that.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.500
It's taken quite a lot of my time.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.480
But I think that they are useful.

01:00.620 --> 01:07.460
It's useful for people in any profession to be able to be in some sort of contact with

01:07.460 --> 01:13.820
their peers and I think particularly in science fiction, since it's worldwide and there are

01:13.820 --> 01:20.980
so many restraints in the way of communication that the professional organizations serve

01:20.980 --> 01:22.420
a very important function.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.820
You served one term as president, correct?

01:26.160 --> 01:31.260
No, I've been sensible enough to stop after one.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.600
I was quite happy with it.

01:32.620 --> 01:33.160
I served two.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.160
Oh, okay.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.000
Okay, switching on one term was no worse than a bad cold.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.920
The second term got very difficult.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.100
Does it get political in that respect?

01:43.840 --> 01:53.400
No, it's just that there are a lot of frustrations involved for writers and they accumulate

01:54.120 --> 01:59.040
and the frustrations involving the science fiction writers of America, the organization,

02:00.040 --> 02:02.360
began to accumulate around my second term.

02:02.940 --> 02:07.080
And science fiction writers are a very glamorous, argumentative bunch.

02:08.340 --> 02:11.660
I love them, but they are hard to get along with sometimes.

02:15.020 --> 02:16.900
Okay, just to switch direction here.

02:18.220 --> 02:21.840
Again, I can't think of anybody who can better answer this question.

02:23.820 --> 02:29.800
Kenan, an unpublished author with a reasonable amount of talent, make it today in the science fiction field,

02:29.860 --> 02:32.620
would you have any particular advice to a would-be science fiction writer?

02:33.100 --> 02:39.760
The science fiction field has always, excepting no times at all, been very hospitable to new writers.

02:41.220 --> 02:47.240
As soon as anybody turns up with a good story, he or she is one of the fraternities.

02:47.240 --> 02:52.500
I think most of the most recent converts to writing science fiction have been female at sea.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.460
And there are two pieces of advice I give.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.540
I have a sort of a set speech, as a matter of fact, answering the two questions on how to be a writer

03:00.540 --> 03:01.980
and how to make a living out of it.

03:03.780 --> 03:07.400
The question, how to be a writer, is answered by you sit down and write.

03:07.740 --> 03:09.080
There's no other way of doing it.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.100
Taking a course in writing won't do it.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.560
Telling your girlfriend, friend, you plan to be a writer, won't do it.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.820
You have to sit down, you have to put words on paper, and you have to finish the story.

03:20.340 --> 03:22.500
Then how do you get to be published and successful?

03:22.960 --> 03:26.200
You take the stories you've written and you mail them to somebody who might buy them.

03:26.460 --> 03:27.940
There's no better way of doing that.

03:28.240 --> 03:35.100
There are many fantasies that people have that if they could just get an influential friend in a publishing house to do it for them,

03:35.780 --> 03:39.400
or an agent who could do it for them, that it would all be made easier.

03:39.400 --> 03:45.740
The fact is that almost no writers become professionals except by doing just that.

03:46.900 --> 03:51.360
Every once in a while, someone finds a shortcut that's sort of like being hit by lightning.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.420
You can't count on them.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.660
That's all there is to it.

03:54.820 --> 03:59.520
You write and you send it off and you keep on doing that until people start publishing it.

04:00.100 --> 04:07.320
Maybe they never will, in which case you've wasted your time, but there is no good way of doing it in any other fashion.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.120
But with a reasonable amount of talent and discipline, there is room if you keep at it.

04:12.140 --> 04:12.880
There is always room.

04:13.260 --> 04:14.780
It is a very hospitable field.

04:15.820 --> 04:25.200
At the moment, I think that, well, up until maybe two years ago, I would have advised any new writer to try writing a novel

04:25.200 --> 04:28.180
because the demand exceeded the supply.

04:28.980 --> 04:35.300
At the moment, I think I would advise them to try writing short stories because it's quite obvious if you look at any of the magazines,

04:35.300 --> 04:37.180
that they're pretty hungry for short stories.

04:37.260 --> 04:39.040
Otherwise, they wouldn't print some of the ones they do.

04:40.560 --> 04:47.740
So, if I were a new writer anxious to write science fiction, I would write short stories, then I would go to the newsstand on the corner,

04:48.720 --> 04:54.860
and I would copy out the addresses of the magazines and send the stories off to them one after another until somebody bought them,

04:55.020 --> 04:57.440
or until the stories the manuscripts were worn out.

04:59.620 --> 05:06.620
Okay. I'm not sure you'd care to answer this next question, but are there any particular contemporary authors

05:06.620 --> 05:12.100
say that it started in the last, oh, five to ten years or so that you particularly think are good, or that you like?

05:12.160 --> 05:14.700
There are a lot of them. There are so many of them that I hate to answer the question.

05:15.100 --> 05:20.640
Some of the ones that I've watched most closely are people like Gene Will, who I think is very talented,

05:20.980 --> 05:24.140
and he's been writing, I guess, a little more than five years, but not much more.

05:25.120 --> 05:33.000
And a number of women who have come into the field, the ones I like best have been in a little longer than five or ten years,

05:33.240 --> 05:43.200
like James Tiptree Jr., which is pen name for Wilming Dallas Sheldon, or Ursula Le Guin, or Joanna Russ, but there are a lot.

05:43.780 --> 05:49.380
So many that I like, as I like them for different things, I hate to say that I like one better than another.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.160
Yeah, that would be difficult. I agree.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.420
Okay, let me end up by coming back to you.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.340
What are you presently working on? What kind of books do you, are you going to be working on in the near future?

06:04.320 --> 06:11.060
Well, I've just finished a whole bunch of books. I made a serious mistake and signed more contracts than I had realized,

06:11.520 --> 06:16.320
and therefore at the beginning of last year I discovered I owed eight books for delivery in 1980.

06:17.600 --> 06:25.120
Fortunately, some of them were non-books, two anthologies in a collection of previously uncollected shorter stories and so on.

06:25.300 --> 06:34.600
Quite a few of them had been largely completed before the year began, but nevertheless I delivered, I actually delivered six books last year,

06:34.860 --> 06:40.600
and one more so far this year, and I've got two to go because I've signed a contract since then.

06:42.140 --> 06:49.580
And the book I've just delivered, well, the most recent book out is a non-fiction book on movies, science fiction movies,

06:49.740 --> 06:58.000
called Science Fiction Studies and Film, which I wrote in collaboration with my son, who had a film degree from Syracuse University,

06:58.200 --> 07:01.760
and I figured he'd do everything I didn't know about film itself.

07:02.980 --> 07:07.780
And the next one out I think will be something called Frederick Poe's Favorite Stories,

07:08.480 --> 07:14.700
which is a sort of retrospective anthology of the stories I was most interested in in the 39 years I was an editor.

07:15.620 --> 07:24.520
And the next one after that is a novel called The Cool War, which Valentine Del Rey will bring out sometime in April, or May, I'm not sure when.

07:27.160 --> 07:33.340
Is there anything you see or you're toying with any kinds of works that would be any kind of radical departure from the things you've done in the past?

07:33.920 --> 07:44.060
There's a novel that I have not got very far with, which is quite a radical departure, and I haven't signed a contract on it.

07:44.180 --> 07:51.480
I've been fiddling with it my spare time thinking about it, but I really don't like to talk about work that I haven't finished yet.

07:52.920 --> 08:01.540
I'm not, maybe it's superstition, but it seems to me that it works out better if I do it all inside my own head.

08:01.880 --> 08:02.940
Don't talk too much about it.

08:03.340 --> 08:13.480
But there is one which I think will be, well, I don't know, I hate to predict, but I think it will be my favorite novel when I get around to doing it.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.780
I was kind of curious.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.880
I understand that you've had a background in ancient history.

08:20.260 --> 08:22.600
I guess what, the Roman emperor Tiberius in ancient Rome?

08:22.620 --> 08:23.700
I don't have a background in anything.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.080
I'm a high school dropout, I'm self-educated.

08:26.600 --> 08:36.300
I was recently notified that I'd been nominated for an honor, and they asked for some background information about education and so on.

08:36.300 --> 08:43.200
So, where I've had all the spaces for education, I wrote an auto-didact, which means that I didn't go to school, I taught myself.

08:45.160 --> 08:52.440
But I have been very interested in history, all kinds of history, but particularly ancient history.

08:52.720 --> 09:00.880
Well, there are some periods that are interesting, more than others in the Romans, or part of the most interesting period to me.

09:00.880 --> 09:11.340
And I did write a book on the emperor Tiberius, which caused the Encyclopedia Britannica to come to me when they wanted a new biography of Tiberius for the new edition of the Encyclopedia.

09:11.660 --> 09:14.060
So I became their authority on Roman emperor.

09:15.020 --> 09:19.900
And I have a good deal of interest in science as a spectator sport.

09:20.940 --> 09:28.180
I spend a lot of time reading journals and magazines and publications that belong to New York Academy of Sciences,

09:28.180 --> 09:33.760
which is the Planetary Society and the American Astronautical Society and the AAAS, and so on.

09:35.540 --> 09:41.680
So there's a lot that interest me, but I cannot say that I have special qualifications in any of those areas.

09:42.980 --> 09:45.440
Have you ever considered writing a pure fantasy novel?

09:46.420 --> 09:52.980
Not really. I've written some short fantasy pieces at one time or another, but I'm not terribly well satisfied with them.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.880
Other people do that far better than I do.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.260
Okay, I just have one more question.

09:58.780 --> 10:06.640
I understand that you go around giving lectures or speaking to various organizations and so forth quite a bit these days.

10:06.760 --> 10:10.080
Could you tell us what you talk about and what kinds of organizations you speak before?

10:10.700 --> 10:12.460
Well, let's see.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.480
Yesterday I spoke to Princeton University on science fiction.

10:16.480 --> 10:24.280
The day before that I spoke to the Association of American Publishers on the Future of Electronic and other non-print publications.

10:25.920 --> 10:30.060
And it sort of goes like that. I talk about either science fiction or the future.

10:31.100 --> 10:36.740
I don't lecture nearly as much as I used to because I found that I got very tired of the sound of my voice,

10:36.920 --> 10:39.680
so I've been limiting it pretty carefully, but I still do it.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.620
Last year I spoke more than I intended.

10:46.320 --> 10:51.420
This year I hope to limit the appearances of that sort to maybe 15 or 20.

10:52.460 --> 10:56.540
But some of your lectures have a futurist topic or tone to them, don't they?

10:56.580 --> 10:57.020
That's right, yeah.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.320
I do talk about the future.

10:59.560 --> 11:07.160
I'm a member of the World Future Society and I've been involved in all three of their world general assemblies as a participant program.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.960
I mean, on the program, section chairman and two of them.

11:10.880 --> 11:19.380
And I have on the back burner a book on future studies, which I may one day get around to finishing.

11:19.820 --> 11:23.140
Actually, I finished it twice and decided I didn't like it both times.

11:27.220 --> 11:32.240
But I'm primarily a first and foremost science fiction writer.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.780
It's in the blood and there's no way I can change it.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.880
Okay, Mr. Paul, that is excellent.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.700
I'm going to give David wants to ask you something for just a second.
