00:01.320 --> 00:03.500
Okay, the tape is rolling.

00:05.980 --> 00:18.720
In Menage Autre, Jason Ward, the hero, attends an autograph session and he didn't seem to

00:18.720 --> 00:20.200
have very much fun there.

00:20.520 --> 00:26.220
Did this arise out of real life experiences or are most of them a little more fun than

00:26.220 --> 00:26.460
that?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.340
Oh, I love autograph sessions.

00:29.140 --> 00:29.760
I love it.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.400
But it's easy to take it and, you know, if you were tired or you wanted to be somewhere

00:36.400 --> 00:43.060
else, I've never had the experience of having an endless group of people come up and come

00:43.060 --> 00:44.840
up and demanding my autograph, you know.

00:45.260 --> 00:47.580
I go to autograph sessions that I've been to.

00:48.020 --> 00:52.660
We figure if eight or twelve people come, everybody's very delighted.

00:57.260 --> 01:07.320
I know that some mainstream authors I have read about get very unhappy at autograph sessions.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.760
They get tired, you know.

01:09.380 --> 01:15.000
When you read about the American Bookseller's Association of Conventions, usually they say

01:15.000 --> 01:18.660
that the science fiction authors were among the most agreeable there who just kept signing

01:18.660 --> 01:24.880
autographs and signing autographs and other people got really upset and cranky and so

01:24.880 --> 01:25.680
forth and so on.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.460
So it's easy to make up and, you know, we've all had experiences when we were doing something

01:32.460 --> 01:37.540
that we wish we were something else so it's easy to take the situation and invent it.

01:38.440 --> 01:43.960
It's very, as we're sitting there and signing good luck and best of wishes and et cetera,

01:44.080 --> 01:47.200
et cetera, et cetera and asking them, how do you spell your name?

01:47.750 --> 01:48.680
That I've been through.

01:49.340 --> 01:52.760
I've learned that you always ask the person how to spell their name because sometimes

01:52.760 --> 01:54.260
they spell it in very different ways.

01:55.980 --> 02:00.840
And I've met authors who could think of very witty, very original things to write in every

02:00.840 --> 02:02.780
book but I freeze up.

02:03.040 --> 02:07.400
You know, I'm glad to sign my name but I can't be creative there on the spur of the moment

02:07.400 --> 02:12.880
so I usually end up saying good luck, best wishes, best ever and do that repeatedly.

02:13.460 --> 02:15.500
So that part was realistic.

02:17.560 --> 02:23.480
Why are science fiction authors so accessible to the fans whereas as you mentioned in other genres,

02:23.660 --> 02:24.000
they're not?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.200
I have no idea.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.660
I don't know.

02:30.040 --> 02:34.220
I don't know if it's science fiction people or writing the thing because they love it.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.720
I would think that most writers write because they love it.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.720
But I just really don't know.

02:42.140 --> 02:46.760
Maybe it's because more than science fiction people have a chance to know their fans on

02:46.760 --> 02:47.620
the first name basis.

02:47.820 --> 02:48.740
They meet them at conventions.

02:49.020 --> 02:53.500
They get in the habit of socializing with the people that are reading their books and

02:55.120 --> 02:56.540
other big name authors.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.860
But maybe don't have that opportunity.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.000
I just really don't know.

03:04.080 --> 03:09.040
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions now just on the general nature of science fiction.

03:09.040 --> 03:14.800
There are those who now claim that there's a glut of fantasy which is appearing and that

03:14.800 --> 03:18.720
this glut of fantasy is appearing to the detriment of science fiction.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.660
Do you have any observations on this, Pro-Recon?

03:24.940 --> 03:26.560
There's a lot of fantasy.

03:27.220 --> 03:28.100
I agree.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.880
I don't know that it's the detriment of science fiction.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.260
I think there's certainly room for both.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.020
I think both fulfill needs of people.

03:36.880 --> 03:45.740
I keep telling mundane kind of people, mainstream kind of people who ask about what do I purpose

03:45.740 --> 03:47.820
or what good is science fiction.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.720
And I keep saying people have always wanted myths.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.320
They have always wanted wonderful creatures.

03:56.060 --> 04:01.440
They sit around the campfire and they would fantasize about the creatures that lived in the next country.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.600
Well, this whole planet, we know what's in the next country on this planet.

04:05.240 --> 04:10.480
The monsters are in outer space or the myths can be in outer space.

04:11.020 --> 04:12.380
They're also in inner space.

04:12.940 --> 04:23.620
It's the same reason that I think that the vampires and horror stories have come up because that's where people can go to for myths now.

04:23.780 --> 04:29.700
I don't know what it is in people that want these wonderful monsters, but they will have them.

04:29.700 --> 04:33.660
They don't care if the world is settled, why they'll go back to the old fashioned ones.

04:34.160 --> 04:45.900
The things that might exist, people that want to reach out can reach out for strange and wonderful creatures beyond space.

04:46.320 --> 04:51.680
The ones that don't want to reach out can reach for the creatures in inner space.

04:52.420 --> 04:56.220
I think it also has to do with a lot of the time.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.000
The space of things are very complex. They're very frightening.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.820
There are no clear cut rights and wrongs.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.220
There's really no answers to lots of problems.

05:08.920 --> 05:14.980
One answer raises a whole lot more problems.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.260
Everything's so interlinked.

05:18.620 --> 05:25.780
You raise employment and you do this and that and some of that is detrimental and so forth.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.900
I don't want to say it's an escape. I don't want to put it down.

05:32.540 --> 05:38.960
I don't read fantasy because I like to reach out.

05:39.180 --> 05:43.800
Maybe it's because I'm a little more optimistic. I believe there will be a tomorrow.

05:44.740 --> 05:52.420
I think people read fantasy because they can get away from all the grays.

05:52.420 --> 05:57.660
Fantasy provides worlds where there are clear rights and clear wrongs

05:57.660 --> 06:05.280
and where you can answer problems with a strong right arm and a magic sword and a pure heart.

06:05.860 --> 06:14.360
I think that the heroic fantasy then gives people something to get away from.

06:17.180 --> 06:22.060
A lot of the movies they were producing during the Depression

06:22.060 --> 06:25.780
and a lot of books they were writing during the Depression adventure stories

06:25.780 --> 06:30.380
were people to get away from the terrible things they had to face every day.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.500
I think that's why there's a lot of fantasy.

06:35.900 --> 06:41.400
I think there's a need for it and I think it's wonderful that it's there for the people who want it.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.600
There's probably a lot of bad fantasy and a lot of junk fantasy

06:45.600 --> 06:49.980
but you go on the mainstream shelf and there's certainly a lot of junk there

06:49.980 --> 06:55.660
and I think that the work that is well written and the work that is good

06:56.540 --> 07:03.840
will probably manage to sustain itself even as the junk comes and goes and passes away.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.220
My engineer wants me to ask a question.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.700
Hang on a second. What question?

07:11.060 --> 07:15.880
Ask her if she thinks that I might have some sort of tie in with the boom in the fantasy role-playing game.

07:16.440 --> 07:22.240
Okay. Do you think this has some sort of tie in with the boom in the fantasy role-playing games?

07:24.360 --> 07:28.260
I think that they're both part and parcel of the same thing.

07:29.080 --> 07:36.220
People who can play roles in fantasy games are being more actively involved in the fantasy

07:36.220 --> 07:39.400
than just sitting there and reading it. They're living it in a sense.

07:40.660 --> 07:49.100
And again, it's a way to be faced with problems that have clear solutions and rights and wrongs to them.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.860
I think probably the fantasy up-search and the fantasy that people was reading,

07:55.960 --> 08:01.640
people were reading King before the role-playing, but I think it's all part of the same thing.

08:02.960 --> 08:14.180
In a way, it's discouraging, but I think it reflects a certain pessimism perhaps about the future.

08:16.940 --> 08:21.160
Perhaps that's why I said that. Perhaps that's why I still like science fiction,

08:21.160 --> 08:26.700
why that's what I write and that's what I read because I retain a certain optimism that somehow,

08:26.900 --> 08:31.840
maybe not grandly or gloriously, people will survive.

08:32.300 --> 08:39.900
I think we will perhaps even prevail. At least we'll limp along into the next century and the century after that

08:39.900 --> 08:45.460
and the century after that. That's kind of what happens in my books.

08:46.540 --> 08:54.480
You may have noticed that there are a lot of large social problems that exist within each book that never get solved,

08:55.420 --> 09:00.080
but people in the book solve their own problems. They handle their own lives.

09:00.660 --> 09:04.620
And I think maybe that's a little bit of personal philosophy of mine comes through that.

09:05.120 --> 09:09.460
I can't solve the world's problems, but I can certainly keep control of my own life

09:09.460 --> 09:12.960
and my belief in that I can pass on.

09:16.760 --> 09:21.880
Which authors writing now do you enjoy? Just out of curiosity.

09:22.380 --> 09:26.860
Oh, a lot of them. I read a lot, always between books.

09:27.420 --> 09:31.320
I sit down and read 40 or 50 of the stretch because they pile up on my shelf.

09:32.580 --> 09:42.100
I like Joseph Wampow. I have enjoyed Louis Thomas who did Medusa in the Snail and Lies in the Cell.

09:43.700 --> 09:54.380
I enjoy Isaac Gassimoff. I enjoy Anne McCaffrey and a lot of Joleri Niven and CJ Cherry.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.520
Not all of Fred Saberhagen, but certainly a lot of his work.

09:59.980 --> 10:06.280
Blancy, some VHB Piper, LaTanis Lee. Now she writes fancy and I do read some of hers.

10:09.660 --> 10:21.900
I've discovered a writer who's now dead, unfortunately, Van Gulick, who wrote a bunch of mysteries about a 7th century Chinese magistrate, Judge D.

10:22.540 --> 10:28.160
I've been started collecting his books. Chelsea Quinn Yarborough I enjoy.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.040
I have a lot of books, a lot of authors I like.

10:32.040 --> 10:40.540
I'm rather Catholic in my reading taste. I read a lot of nonfiction as well as fiction, science books, sociology books.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.780
This is just a trivia fact. It's not anything to the interview.

10:47.240 --> 10:52.200
You mentioned Louis Thomas. I have a friend who lives in Connecticut who's working on an MBA.

10:52.960 --> 11:01.040
In one of his business ethics courses, they had to read both the Louis Thomas books, which you wouldn't expect in a business course.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.420
It's a little unexpected, yeah.

11:03.800 --> 11:04.800
But it's encouraging.

11:06.100 --> 11:18.320
The other great question I want to ask you, there are those that are bothered by a seemingly recent trend in that everybody's writing prequels and sequels.

11:18.420 --> 11:22.660
In fact, the Hugo Awards, all the novels nominated were either prequels or sequels.

11:22.980 --> 11:27.260
Some people are bothered by this. Other people don't care. Do you have any feelings on this?

11:28.700 --> 11:35.120
Well, I started out thinking that I was going to write each one different.

11:38.640 --> 11:44.740
And I may still end up doing a lot of that, you know, creating, rebuilding the world anew each summer by the book.

11:45.860 --> 11:49.320
It's certainly easy if you already have the background there.

11:51.060 --> 11:57.840
And in a sense, it's no worse than mainstream writers who are writing all out of the same world, aren't they?

11:58.480 --> 12:01.540
And yet they get infinite stories out of that one particular world.

12:03.140 --> 12:19.120
I think the readers, what's the word?

12:19.880 --> 12:25.300
I mean, how many continual mystery characters are there?

12:25.400 --> 12:26.320
They're detectives.

12:27.520 --> 12:31.580
Mystery is replete with series characters.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.540
And why do you think people watch series television?

12:37.040 --> 12:40.140
Because they like to see these same characters over and over and over again.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.920
They get hooked on a character.

12:43.600 --> 12:57.920
I suppose it can be a little discouraging to think, well, gee, they're not after any new ideas or just after these one characters who, if they're in a series, they can't really change because they have to keep the same, but they're not the same characters anymore.

12:59.460 --> 13:02.800
Oh dear. We're getting a buzz.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.240
You hear a buzz?

13:05.640 --> 13:05.980
Yeah.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.580
Okay, we don't hear it over here, so apparently it's not getting on the tape.

13:09.880 --> 13:10.560
Oh, okay.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.820
Okay, go ahead and continue if you want.

13:19.560 --> 13:30.620
It can be financially rewarding to have a series because people like a particular character, then you know you've got an audience every time you write a book about that particular character.

13:34.260 --> 13:46.340
And it, I don't know, it'd be nice if each of the award-winning books was something that stood on itself instead of being parked in a series.

13:46.660 --> 13:56.960
And maybe award-winning books should be, should be, but certainly the things that are voted by the fans like the hugos or the things that they want to read.

14:00.580 --> 14:10.880
And while I think a writer should necessarily pander to public taste, if he wants to make a living, he's certainly got to write something that people want to read.

14:11.440 --> 14:17.800
And if he has engaging characters and people like them, and why not write about them?

14:17.800 --> 14:26.320
I've got people hounding me to write more Momma Maxwell and Janet Brill, and I have no objections to doing that.

14:26.740 --> 14:32.160
There are good pair of characters to make a series because they don't have to change from book to book.

14:32.940 --> 14:45.200
On the other hand, the book I'm writing now is, had carries within it the seeds for a sequel, but it wouldn't have the same characters in it.

14:45.200 --> 14:49.100
It would simply be more of a story further on down the line.

14:50.140 --> 14:58.760
I can't really blame readers for liking a series of books if they liked this particular book, why they want more of the same.

14:59.380 --> 15:04.060
And I can't blame writers who want to make a living for giving them more of the same.

15:04.260 --> 15:07.860
And I can't blame the writers. Readers for buying it and reading it.

15:10.580 --> 15:15.040
I don't know that it's any kind of a degeneration in literature.

15:16.780 --> 15:19.220
Those books may last, they may not.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.880
I think a writer is an entertainer.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.620
A writer is an entertainer.

15:29.240 --> 15:35.740
And if he thinks that he's creating desolate prose with every line he struggles to put down,

15:35.740 --> 15:43.600
and if he's writing for history, then he's probably got pretensions of grandeur.

15:45.160 --> 15:52.840
If I write a book that people buy and read by buying, they give me my money, which I need.

15:53.440 --> 15:57.280
And if they enjoy it by reading it, then I'm really happy.

15:59.120 --> 16:07.240
I don't think I would write a book just for money, but certainly I want to write something that is fun for me to write,

16:07.400 --> 16:10.080
and I want to write something that is fun for readers to read.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.480
Okay, David, did you have a question?

16:16.920 --> 16:19.620
Now the engineer wants to ask you a question himself.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.800
Can you hear me all right?

16:22.340 --> 16:22.700
Yes.

16:23.160 --> 16:26.140
Okay, my question is about writing and writing technique.

16:26.140 --> 16:31.860
When you start writing a story, do you develop your characters first or the storyline first?

16:33.320 --> 16:38.780
Which comes first and which follows, and how does it progress into the full-blown story?

16:39.740 --> 16:42.000
It's sometimes one way and sometimes the other.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.840
Sometimes I have a character.

16:44.460 --> 16:47.260
I'm trying to think of one in which I had a character first.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.120
I know I have.

16:51.840 --> 17:00.200
But I have had others where there was a story idea, and then I searched in that idea for the character who was most affected

17:00.200 --> 17:04.340
so that I could have that character at the center.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.320
Sometimes I make mistakes.

17:05.940 --> 17:13.000
I was the captain in the book I'm writing right now before I realized that one of the characters I had as protagonists

17:13.840 --> 17:19.840
didn't know a whole lot of things that it would increase tension if the audience knew.

17:19.840 --> 17:20.900
Therefore I went back.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.860
I had a character who just sort of wanted on the page.

17:23.960 --> 17:28.720
He was going to be a bit character that I was interested in him, and I thought I'm going to do a book about him eventually.

17:29.160 --> 17:34.200
And then it occurred to me that he knew the kind of things that would be interesting for the readers to know.

17:34.700 --> 17:39.440
So I went back and made him the other protagonist for the book.

17:40.520 --> 17:44.640
But other times I've had a character that I was interested in.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.300
Oh, yeah.

17:46.540 --> 17:49.800
House divided the woman who was the split personality.

17:50.420 --> 17:57.560
I had her first and had worked out her character, and then I found a situation to put her in.

17:58.420 --> 18:00.920
So sometimes it works one way and sometimes it works the other.

18:01.580 --> 18:07.100
Sometimes I have a setting and I have a beautiful setting, then I have to figure out a story and characters to go with it.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.660
I think stories start all kinds of ways.

18:13.040 --> 18:13.560
Okay.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.780
That's my list of questions.

18:17.220 --> 18:17.660
Okay.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.560
Let's see. It's almost an hour and 15 minutes.

18:21.780 --> 18:22.160
My goodness.

18:24.460 --> 18:26.120
Okay, I'll become a fan again.

18:26.300 --> 18:33.720
Yeah, I love the Mama Maxwell and Janet Brill stories, and I would hope to see them again.

18:35.160 --> 18:43.440
And the reason I wanted to talk to you, I was just kind of accidentally stumbled on you when the first novel came out.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.180
And bang, bang, bang, here came four novels.

18:47.700 --> 18:50.160
And they've all been very good and very enjoyable.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.760
And so that's the reason I wanted to talk to you.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.940
Plus you seemed very accessible at the con.

18:55.180 --> 18:58.460
So we appreciate getting to talk to you.

18:59.040 --> 18:59.540
I hope.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.640
I'm glad you like the line.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.320
That's why I say writer is entertainer.

19:04.500 --> 19:12.180
And if people don't enjoy reading my stuff, then I failed somewhere along the line, no matter how many, how much, how artistic the book might be.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.620
I'm definitely going to do more with Mama Maxwell and Janet Brill.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.760
I was going to do them next, but I have this sequel idea for this other book.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.540
I think maybe it'll be next.

19:24.200 --> 19:24.880
Let's see.

19:25.920 --> 19:26.680
I had something.

19:26.680 --> 19:27.300
Oh, yeah.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.680
Your statement about writers being entertainers.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.540
I have a feeling that's going to be one of the shows.

19:32.620 --> 19:39.400
That's too good to pass up that when you were kind of at the end, getting to the end of that, that was, I think, quite revelatory.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.420
And I agree.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.340
I just never had thought of it that way.

19:45.720 --> 19:53.280
But, uh, sure, sure, you'll have to go on strike so you can become a free agent or whatever.

19:53.280 --> 19:53.840
Certainly.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.480
The publishers have the best because there are a lot of people who want to be writers.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.780
And so, uh, the competition is fierce.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.360
Yeah, I would think so.

20:07.100 --> 20:13.020
It would be nice if I, as an entertainer, I could pull down the same kind of salary that football entertainer pulls down, for instance.

20:14.220 --> 20:15.120
Now, now we have...

20:15.120 --> 20:16.800
One of these days maybe I'll get the best salary.

20:16.960 --> 20:17.860
That's what I'm working for.

20:17.860 --> 20:19.980
You have to know what's important in life.

20:20.160 --> 20:24.620
And obviously football is, uh, it's even more important than the President of the United States.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.740
I wouldn't be the President of the United States.

20:30.000 --> 20:30.960
It's a no-win situation.

20:32.140 --> 20:33.040
That's for sure.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.100
David, any more questions?

20:35.540 --> 20:42.620
No. Tell her this will probably be edited within two months and we'll be sending her copy tapes of the air program.

20:42.860 --> 20:43.460
Okay, fine.

20:43.460 --> 20:48.500
We'll send you a copy of the interview and then we'll also edit it with an...

20:48.500 --> 20:50.240
No, no, no, we'll send her copy tapes of the program.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.320
Well, yeah, I was going to get to that, yeah.

20:52.580 --> 20:56.720
And then we will send you copies of the edited programs for your enjoyment.

20:57.700 --> 20:58.580
And, uh...

20:58.580 --> 20:59.440
I love hearing them.

20:59.580 --> 21:00.000
Okay.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.500
Sure appreciate your talking to us.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.460
We enjoyed it.

21:03.820 --> 21:05.540
And, uh, keep on writing.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.960
We're out here and we read it and, uh, we'd like to see some more.

21:09.960 --> 21:14.460
About six more chapters of this book to go, which I've got to get done by the first of March.

21:14.820 --> 21:16.720
It is, you have it in by the first of April.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.020
You'll find out what happened to those columns.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.200
I would like to know.

21:21.040 --> 21:29.900
Is this...are you going to...are most of your books going to appear paperback first, uh, or hardback, uh, first editions on down the line for writers?

21:30.280 --> 21:31.980
I've never really understood how that works.

21:32.780 --> 21:37.920
It's a lot easier to get published in paperbacks because let's face it, a hardback is expensive

21:37.920 --> 21:47.260
and people are much more likely to put out $2.25 to $2.50 for something that looks interesting, uh, and that they might like.

21:47.700 --> 21:52.320
They're going to have to be sure they're going to want it before they're going to put out $10 or $12 for it.

21:53.200 --> 22:02.400
Um, the mass market media is paperback and it's much easier for...to get published in paperback.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.200
And it's certainly easier to get your name spread around that way.

22:06.200 --> 22:12.200
I think later perhaps, my agent is trying for some hardback editions and I would be...

22:12.200 --> 22:14.640
I'd be loved to have some stuff picked up by the Science Fiction Book Club.

22:14.780 --> 22:15.720
It hasn't happened yet.

22:16.540 --> 22:22.040
I have some story ideas and proposals into my agent that she's trying for hardback.

22:22.540 --> 22:25.660
She has a vampire novel of mine that she's trying for hardback.

22:26.180 --> 22:29.180
But I have a feeling that when it comes out, it'll probably come out paperback.

22:29.460 --> 22:30.940
Is it a vampire mystery novel?

22:31.220 --> 22:33.000
It's a vampire cop mystery novel.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.520
But what vampire police procedure novel?

22:37.960 --> 22:43.040
One of the vampires in it is a cop and he's another unusual.

22:43.240 --> 22:47.720
He's about five age and he's blonde and gray-eyed and he's Irish-American.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.880
He's a little different than your normal vampire.

22:53.140 --> 22:55.460
Well, you've got the corner on the market.

22:56.400 --> 23:00.880
Oh, okay. You've got the corner on the market on police procedure novels and they are enjoyable.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.820
So he might as well throw in everything.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.440
Engineer has another question. Yes?

23:05.000 --> 23:09.120
What sort of mythos is he using on the vampire? Can he go out there in the daylight?

23:09.500 --> 23:12.880
Okay. Which of the vampire mythos is...

23:13.640 --> 23:16.180
Whatever the plural is, are you using? Can he go out in the day?

23:17.840 --> 23:22.020
Oh, yes. I picked up most of the things straight out of Dracula.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.600
I went ahead and used that.

23:24.020 --> 23:27.420
Except he goes out in the daytime but he feels miserable. He hates it.

23:27.420 --> 23:30.760
He can subsist on any blood as long as it's blood.

23:33.260 --> 23:37.420
Crosses don't bother him because he wasn't particularly religious growing up but...

23:39.100 --> 23:41.440
He quits breathing in the presence of garlic.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.260
It's like he's all the air in his lungs turned to concrete.

23:45.900 --> 23:50.600
He can't go in, of course he isn't invited, but he finds a distinct handicap as a police officer.

23:53.380 --> 23:54.420
He can go through...

23:54.420 --> 23:57.720
He can go through walls. Now I might have to rewrite that.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.220
There was one point where he goes through a solid wall.

24:00.560 --> 24:05.200
Every place else he went through fight doors and so forth which he could have gone in.

24:05.220 --> 24:07.940
He didn't really know how he went through. He just knew he did.

24:08.420 --> 24:11.880
He didn't examine the procedure too closely because he didn't like being a vampire.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.680
He didn't really want to get to know the whole thing too well.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.520
Let's see what are some of the other things.

24:21.540 --> 24:22.240
Disproportionate strength.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.360
Disproportionate strength? Is that what you said?

24:26.960 --> 24:27.380
Oh, yes.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.440
Superhuman strength, I think.

24:30.080 --> 24:36.160
Very disproportionate strength. Very strong sense of smell and very strong hearing.

24:37.100 --> 24:42.760
And I wrote the book to be as realistic as possible.

24:43.060 --> 24:46.280
Of course the reader knows right away, practically, that there's a vampire involved.

24:49.380 --> 24:52.740
But he doesn't even catch on that she's a vampire when she's biting him.

24:52.760 --> 24:56.600
He thinks she's really weird because I tried to think,

24:56.720 --> 24:59.460
what would a normal everyday person think?

24:59.900 --> 25:02.180
A person's glommed onto their throat that way.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.940
And even when he's in the hospital and he's miserable in the daylight

25:05.940 --> 25:09.280
and he feels much better at night and he's throwing up food

25:09.280 --> 25:13.560
and his front teeth are coming loose and things like that.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.060
He has to sit there and watch the Friday Fright Night movies

25:16.060 --> 25:20.440
and watch Dracula on the movie before he starts to catch on what's going on.

25:20.800 --> 25:21.120
You know?

25:24.000 --> 25:29.320
Did you, you mentioned Saber Hagen, did you read his, or enjoy his Dracula novels?

25:29.880 --> 25:30.460
Oh, very much.

25:31.040 --> 25:34.220
I have all Chelsea Quinn Yardbrows too, but I haven't managed to read them yet.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.540
They're sitting on the shelf waiting.

25:35.900 --> 25:38.280
I understand they're quite good. I haven't read them yet either.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.740
I have, I guess he's bringing out a fifth.

25:40.740 --> 25:45.340
I have four of them and the fifth in the series, which is a modern day one, I guess.

25:46.860 --> 25:50.500
But I've enjoyed the Fred Saber Hagen books very, very much.

25:50.640 --> 25:54.460
And there's a couple of other vampire ones that have been, oh,

25:55.520 --> 26:00.220
that's the Tanneth Lee had one that was very enjoyable.

26:02.180 --> 26:02.700
Subella?

26:03.940 --> 26:05.080
Was that Subella?

26:06.140 --> 26:06.580
Yeah.

26:06.580 --> 26:10.960
And there were a couple of others I read that weren't all that terrific.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.800
But, yeah, I find vampires very fascinating.

26:15.340 --> 26:19.200
I've also got the Vampire Tapestry, which is on my reading shelf too.

26:20.060 --> 26:25.460
If the cop can carry warrants through the wall, I guess that would be quite a plus for him.

26:26.660 --> 26:27.700
He could carry warrants.

26:27.700 --> 26:28.480
He could carry warrants.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.240
Oh.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.800
I don't know if he could do that or not.

26:35.380 --> 26:38.140
Presumably his clothes would go with him, but I don't know about papers.

26:40.140 --> 26:45.920
I don't think I ever had him carrying a solid object through at the point to which he was going through

26:45.920 --> 26:49.500
and carrying solid objects. It's like a mesh gate or something.

26:49.660 --> 26:54.320
That was when he was carrying his thermos bottle so he could fill it up with blood and take it home

26:54.320 --> 26:57.120
until he'd have a couple of days supply and wouldn't have to hunt all the time.

26:57.960 --> 27:02.680
If that doesn't make hard back, will that be a Del Ray book and come out in a science fiction package?

27:02.680 --> 27:06.320
Unfortunately, it won't be a Del Ray because I was under contract to write that book.

27:06.780 --> 27:13.900
And once it was turned in, they turned it down because Judy Lynn really isn't a fantasy editor.

27:14.760 --> 27:18.280
And I don't know why she wanted, why she thought she wanted the book.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.320
She was explaining why she turned it down.

27:21.680 --> 27:27.400
And it sounded to me like her image of a vampire is the Hollywood image where they have to sleep underground

27:27.400 --> 27:32.440
in a coffin at night and can't go out in the daylight at all.

27:35.080 --> 27:41.060
And it sounded like she hadn't read any of the recent vampire books and she probably didn't sound like she'd read Dracula either

27:41.060 --> 27:45.340
because Dracula went out in daylight. In fact, the more blood he drank, the better he felt.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.500
And he was out there running around in daylight perfectly well.

27:47.580 --> 27:49.880
He just couldn't change shape and things like that in the daylight.

27:50.360 --> 27:53.980
Oh, my guy's not a shape changer either. And he does reflect in a mirror.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.940
Makes it hard to shave if he can according to the engineer.

28:02.220 --> 28:02.800
That's true.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.800
Somebody teased him once.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.780
He was saying he was allergic to garlic.

28:07.980 --> 28:10.020
Somebody says, oh, how long have you been a vampire?

28:10.940 --> 28:14.400
At which point he started to freak out and he realized that they were just teasing him.

28:15.720 --> 28:20.260
And they asked him something about shaving and he said, well, the electric razor was a great boon to vampires.

28:23.180 --> 28:23.660
Okay.

28:25.920 --> 28:29.900
The engineer uses an electric razor so he appreciates that he says.

28:31.520 --> 28:34.100
It's been very nice talking to you. Thanks again.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.260
And we look forward to seeing what's coming out.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.000
You'll hear from us with a little package of tapes one of these days.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.520
Okay, you bet. Bye-bye now.
