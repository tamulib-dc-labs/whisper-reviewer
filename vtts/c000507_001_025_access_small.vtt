00:09.240 --> 00:13.360
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:29.820 --> 00:35.400
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.980
And here are your hosts.

00:50.900 --> 00:57.220
She began publishing professionally in 1953, some 30 years ago, but she had been writing

00:57.220 --> 00:58.400
long before that even.

01:21.160 --> 01:26.020
Like many other present-day science fiction authors, Bradley was introduced to the field

01:26.020 --> 01:28.560
through the pulp magazines in the golden age of science fiction.

01:29.780 --> 01:34.480
Well, when I was a child, I thought that if I wanted to grow up and be a writer, I would

01:34.480 --> 01:39.360
probably write historical fiction, because that was what I liked best at that time, although

01:39.360 --> 01:43.720
I always loved things like writer Haggard, but they were in such old books that I decided

01:43.720 --> 01:45.340
they weren't being published anymore.

01:46.280 --> 01:53.060
Then when I discovered the new pulp magazines, astounding, thrilling wonder, that sort of

01:53.060 --> 01:58.620
thing, and I saw the fan magazines in the back, the fan scenes and the letters from

01:58.620 --> 02:03.980
fans, I thought, my goodness, there are other people who like this sort of thing, and all

02:03.980 --> 02:07.920
of a sudden I realized not only that I wanted to write for a living, but that I wanted to

02:07.920 --> 02:09.960
write science fiction and fantasy.

02:11.080 --> 02:15.640
Bradley is high on the value of science fiction and believes it can be of benefit to anyone.

02:16.620 --> 02:20.980
People are always asking me why I write science fiction when there are so many other things

02:20.980 --> 02:26.740
or why I'm not into mainstream fiction, and I have written mainstream novels, but my feeling

02:26.740 --> 02:32.180
is science fiction is a very... and fantasy, of course, is a very valuable genre because

02:32.760 --> 02:34.800
it forces people to think.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.260
You can't just, oh, I suppose you can in the slam bang action stuff, but even in those,

02:41.400 --> 02:45.260
there is a residue of what if the world were different than it is now.

02:45.940 --> 02:52.940
People in our society and in our schools are supposed to have a keep tight to reality

02:52.940 --> 03:00.560
and not imagine things and don't be so imaginative, and I think imagination is the one great thing

03:00.560 --> 03:05.980
that distinguishes us from the beasts, and science fiction is a very valuable corrective

03:05.980 --> 03:11.020
to modern education because it makes people think and it forces them to stretch their

03:11.020 --> 03:14.880
imaginations which get sort of atrophied in the average school.

03:15.780 --> 03:21.000
Much of Bradley's work deals with parapsychology, telepathy, ESP, things having to do with

03:21.000 --> 03:21.480
the occult.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.460
We ask her why these topics interested her so much.

03:25.120 --> 03:41.000
Well, possibly because, as I said before, I began my reading with such people as Ryder

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
and they, of course, were all roughly connected, which I found out later, to the Golden Dawn

03:47.000 --> 03:49.260
Order, the magical order in England.

03:50.360 --> 03:55.240
Also, there is a lot of history.

03:55.780 --> 04:01.180
Fantasy sort of comes out of the occultism, as it were, and what's now called the Neopagan

04:01.180 --> 04:03.920
religions, but of course they didn't exist at that time.

04:04.420 --> 04:09.720
So I thought I was the only person interested in these things, and when I got into Haggard,

04:09.720 --> 04:15.380
Mundi, people like that, I realized this is what I was looking for.

04:15.460 --> 04:19.640
There are a lot of people, I think, who look in science fiction and fantasy for validation

04:19.640 --> 04:25.320
of the fact that there are other things in life than you might say, the mundane round

04:25.320 --> 04:26.400
and materialism.

04:26.980 --> 04:31.800
And those of us who can't get into conventional religion, which I've never been able to do

04:31.800 --> 04:39.460
for various and sundry reasons, we use that, I think, as a way of looking for what was

04:39.460 --> 04:44.980
real in religion behind the dogma and behind all the nonsense and hellfire.

04:45.540 --> 04:50.080
Bradley is published around 50 novels so far, in addition to numerous short stories, essays,

04:50.320 --> 04:51.800
and various other literary projects.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.540
Not all of her novels have been science fiction or fantasy.

04:55.140 --> 04:59.440
Most of the ones that are concern the planet Darkover, her most popular creation.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.800
There are some 15 novels in the Darkover series presently, and the list is still growing.

05:04.140 --> 05:06.800
Next time we'll talk to Bradley about her Darkover series.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.620
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:18.620 --> 05:22.960
Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:39.460 --> 06:09.080
Thank you.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:29.060 --> 06:34.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.540
And here are your hosts.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.660
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.420
Among the most popular of science fiction stories would have to be the Darkover stories

06:49.420 --> 06:50.940
of Marion Zimmer Bradley.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.380
The series would have to be considered as one of the most enduring, too.

06:55.040 --> 06:59.280
So far it numbers some 15 novels and two collections of short stories, and more novels are on the

06:59.280 --> 06:59.460
way.

06:59.460 --> 07:04.420
Darkover is a planet. It circles a red sun, which gives it a rich, dusky atmosphere.

07:05.200 --> 07:09.000
The highest culture on Darkover consists of descendants of humans who crash-landed on

07:09.000 --> 07:10.380
the planet many centuries before.

07:10.580 --> 07:14.800
And they've developed telepathic powers. Their whole culture is based on the use of these

07:14.800 --> 07:16.980
mental powers, rather than on technology.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.500
Humans from Earth eventually rediscover Darkover, and there is a conflict between the two cultures.

07:22.120 --> 07:26.560
The technological emphasis of Earth and its empire, versus the slower, provincial, almost

07:26.560 --> 07:29.240
feudal society of the Darkovens, which is based on telepathy.

07:29.560 --> 07:34.040
Even though the novels and stories of Darkover are related, Bradley did not consider them

07:34.040 --> 07:36.540
as a series when she started writing about Darkover.

07:37.300 --> 07:43.900
I started trying to do that around the time I wrote Forbidden Tower. Originally, no.

07:44.540 --> 07:50.100
I had a feeling, and other writers told me rather cynically, that the life of a paperback

07:50.100 --> 07:53.580
book was about five or six months that nobody...

07:53.580 --> 08:00.460
And so I assumed... I realized it was not safe to assume that anyone who read any of

08:00.460 --> 08:05.680
my books had ever read a previous book or would ever read another book by me. So I worked

08:05.680 --> 08:10.540
very hard to make each book stand on its own feet and not assume any knowledge of previous

08:10.540 --> 08:11.120
books.

08:12.160 --> 08:16.460
We asked her if she considered each Darkover story as a separate creation and not part of

08:16.460 --> 08:17.300
a consistent whole.

08:18.720 --> 08:23.500
That's right. I try very hard to make each book have its own internal consistency and

08:23.500 --> 08:28.880
logic, but if the books don't jive with one another, then the readers are just going to

08:28.880 --> 08:31.600
have to use their own imagination to fill in the gaps.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.380
She explains why she writes so often about Darkover.

08:36.400 --> 08:41.760
Well, it started originally from laziness. I was going to college, putting myself through

08:41.760 --> 08:47.140
college, and then later, I was supporting a sick husband and a couple of children when

08:47.140 --> 08:52.920
I married for the second time. And my husband was quite ill and couldn't work much, and

08:53.480 --> 08:57.660
the babies were still in diapers. And it was the only job I could take that would let me

08:57.660 --> 09:02.040
stay home and look after them, because, well, it was really too really easy to cope with

09:02.700 --> 09:03.180
that.

09:03.360 --> 09:07.580
So I figured if I could sell books while I was putting myself through college, I could

09:07.580 --> 09:12.980
certainly do it while I was home looking after the kids. And so I started writing.

09:13.800 --> 09:19.960
And when you have a nice setting and background, which is as fully worked out as Darkover was

09:19.960 --> 09:25.700
for me, well, you tend to go back to it rather than trying to invent a whole new world, partly

09:25.700 --> 09:30.100
because it's easier and partly because you realize you haven't, the books are tailored

09:30.100 --> 09:34.820
to, in those days, the books were tailored to such close commercial restrictions about

09:34.820 --> 09:40.180
length and so forth, that I realized every time that I'd had to cut out so much from

09:40.180 --> 09:44.400
my own thinking about the book, that what I'd cut out would make a sizable new book,

09:44.500 --> 09:50.680
and it was a lot simpler. I figured that since people would read lots of books about Tarzan

09:50.680 --> 09:56.420
or Perry Mason or Nero Wolfe or whatever, people evidently liked reading about stories

09:56.420 --> 10:00.460
with the same background. It was easier to write them than to invent a whole new universe

10:00.460 --> 10:09.580
for each book. That is, as I say at the beginning, it was laziness. Then later, I wanted to give

10:09.580 --> 10:15.080
up the whole thing because I thought people must be getting tired of it. And I told Don

10:15.080 --> 10:19.880
Walheim this and he said, oh no, people are always asking when is there going to be another

10:19.880 --> 10:26.100
book about Darkover? And so I decided, good heavens, if it really is a series, maybe I

10:26.100 --> 10:29.520
ought to start thinking of it as a series and take it seriously that way.

10:40.400 --> 10:46.140
The first Darkover novel, The Sword of Aldonis, was published in 1962. The latest, Hawk Mistress,

10:46.540 --> 10:47.960
was released recently in paperback.

10:48.260 --> 10:52.800
Bradley has signed a contract for two more Darkover novels, so the series will be growing

10:52.800 --> 10:57.300
in the coming years. Science fiction readers will be delighted at that news. We'll continue

10:57.300 --> 10:59.420
our discussion with Marion Zimmer Bradley next time.

11:06.560 --> 11:11.540
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

11:11.540 --> 11:15.480
Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:58.540 --> 11:59.400
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show. The first Darkover novel, The Sword

11:59.420 --> 12:02.480
of Aldonis, is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

12:18.990 --> 12:24.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.480
And here are your hosts.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.880
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon.

12:35.500 --> 12:40.160
Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover stories are based on one overall conflict, the technological

12:40.160 --> 12:43.700
might of Earth versus the telepathic powers of the inhabitants of Darkover.

12:43.880 --> 12:48.660
The planet Darkover, circling a blood-red sun, contains valuable crystals which greatly

12:48.660 --> 12:53.800
magnify and concentrate telepathic ability. These crystals are the bases of the Darkovin

12:53.800 --> 12:54.540
civilization.

12:55.060 --> 12:58.740
Earth wants access to the crystals, and it wants Darkover as part of its interstellar

12:58.740 --> 12:59.140
empire.

12:59.540 --> 13:04.380
But the Darkovens resist. The conflict never really breaks into a full-scale interplanetary

13:04.380 --> 13:09.500
war, but the tension leads to all sorts of intrigues, skirmishes, and spying activities.

13:10.180 --> 13:14.240
Relying on their middle powers is the Darkovens do. They've never developed a technology.

13:14.780 --> 13:18.340
In fact, they often seem anti-technological, though Bradley says this is not the case.

13:18.820 --> 13:24.560
I don't think so much anti-technological as thinking that perhaps there are better

13:24.560 --> 13:32.620
ways to do things than by technology. It isn't so much anti-technological as a concept that

13:32.620 --> 13:38.080
possibly the same kind of technology does not fit every planet, just as materialism

13:38.080 --> 13:43.300
does not fit every human mind, that there are different universes for different mental

13:43.300 --> 13:52.040
sets. I think I'm a very sort of alternative culture person myself, and from the time I

13:52.040 --> 13:57.260
was a child I have never liked the idea that everybody has to fit into the same lockstep

13:57.260 --> 14:02.900
and be, well, they now say, be clones. My daughter calls the ordinary kids at school

14:02.900 --> 14:09.020
who never think of anything except football games, clones. Well, I felt that way when

14:09.020 --> 14:14.880
I was a youngster, and so I suppose the idea of leaving open options and choices for everybody

14:14.880 --> 14:19.540
so they can find the kind of lifestyle that suits them best instead of blambly assuming

14:19.540 --> 14:24.680
that everybody has to belong to the same lifestyle. That was something that I felt very strongly

14:24.680 --> 14:28.700
about when I was a kid, and I feel even more strongly about than I did when I was 15.

14:29.840 --> 14:34.400
Bradley seems to be fairly even-handed in presenting the conflict between Darkoven and

14:34.400 --> 14:39.360
Earth, but she also has sympathy for Darkoven's position and even seems to admire its way

14:39.360 --> 14:43.320
of life. We asked her if it would be fair to say that she tends to be slightly on the

14:43.320 --> 14:49.420
side of non-technological Darkoven. No, it would not. My very life is dependent on technology.

14:50.200 --> 14:55.860
I am myself a diabetic and dependent upon medical preparations which are very difficult

14:55.860 --> 15:02.000
to get in an anti-technological or non-technological culture. It is simply that I like, I do what

15:02.000 --> 15:08.720
you call an even-handed job because, well, my husband says it's because I'm a Gemini,

15:09.000 --> 15:14.480
and it's true that I am cursed with seeing two sides of everything. When I was a kid

15:14.480 --> 15:19.280
and reading in school about what a terrible person Benedict Arnold was, I still realized

15:19.280 --> 15:23.460
that to the British, she was a hero, and it suddenly occurred to me that the villain is

15:23.460 --> 15:29.720
always, except for really real criminals like mass murderers, rapists, that sort of thing,

15:29.720 --> 15:35.660
almost every quote, villain, unquote, is just the victim of a political conflict, he's

15:35.660 --> 15:41.540
the hero of the other side. One thing, though, that Bradley admires in the Darkoven society

15:41.540 --> 15:47.200
is the compact. The compact outlaws, guns, explosives, or energy weapons of any kind.

15:47.880 --> 15:53.020
Any fighting must be done with swords, knives, bows and arrows, and so forth. In this day

15:53.020 --> 15:57.740
and age with nuclear weapons every place, I think every human being has to be in sympathy

15:57.740 --> 16:02.340
with the compact or if they aren't, there's something wrong with their brains. At least

16:02.340 --> 16:08.320
under the compact, if you have only a sword or a knife, you can do only one person's

16:08.320 --> 16:13.380
amount of damage. I suppose it's my emotional reaction to the fact that when I was 15 years

16:13.380 --> 16:19.800
old, it became possible to wipe out all human life on earth if one paranoid politician presses

16:19.800 --> 16:25.240
the wrong button. And I think maybe that's too much power and would like to see power

16:25.240 --> 16:32.140
back in the hands of individuals over their own lives. I don't like the idea that we are

16:32.140 --> 16:40.040
all, you might say, hostages in a monstrous political and ideological conflict. I can't

16:40.040 --> 16:45.420
believe that God is on one side and that on the other there is only the devil.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.580
On our next show, we'll discuss one of Bradley's Darkoven novels, The Shattered Chain.

16:57.920 --> 17:02.820
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

17:02.820 --> 17:06.700
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:25.240 --> 17:54.700
Thank you.

17:58.520 --> 18:02.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:18.460 --> 18:23.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.200
And here are your hosts.

18:32.840 --> 18:37.920
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. The Shattered Chain is one of the 15 Science Fiction novels

18:37.920 --> 18:41.800
that presently make up Marion Zimmer Bradley's series about the planet Darkoven.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.920
The novel deals with one of the basic problems or dilemmas of the Darkoven society, the position of women.

18:47.120 --> 18:52.560
And in doing that, the book also confronts the same issue in our society today. It treats the role of women

18:52.560 --> 18:58.820
in a sensitive, understanding manner. The novel follows three women, Lady Rohana, a noble Darkoven

18:58.820 --> 19:03.820
woman with children, Ja'elle, the leader of a band of free Amazon warrior women, and Magda,

19:04.020 --> 19:06.260
an Earth woman who becomes involved with the free Amazons.

19:06.460 --> 19:10.980
The free Amazons are a sisterhood of Darkoven women who have dropped out of normal society.

19:11.440 --> 19:15.040
They order their lives with the principles contained in the oath of the free Amazons.

19:15.660 --> 19:20.620
The idea behind the oath is total freedom, both physically and emotionally, from a male-dominated culture.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.180
The oath has been admired by women's liberation readers. We ask Bradley what the impetus behind it was.

19:26.180 --> 19:33.740
As a matter of fact, it was sort of spontaneous. I was writing along in the story, and I had the slightest idea

19:33.740 --> 19:38.900
of what was going to happen until Magda ran into the free Amazons. And I thought, well, what would they do to her?

19:39.160 --> 19:44.160
They certainly wouldn't kill her because they're peaceful people. And then it suddenly occurred to me,

19:44.360 --> 19:52.780
the penalty for passing yourself off as an Amazon might be to be forced into actually observing their laws.

19:53.700 --> 20:01.160
And so, also, it was in a way a literary device to get Magda among them to explore it,

20:01.680 --> 20:09.520
explore it from the heroine's eye. But I found myself suddenly just writing down the oath.

20:09.660 --> 20:14.460
I didn't figure it out beforehand. I just said, now, what would this group of people be,

20:14.460 --> 20:18.000
the people who came among them, and that sort of just poured out?

20:19.060 --> 20:23.960
Both Magda and Lady Rohanna admire the free Amazons. Magda, in fact, chooses to become one.

20:24.240 --> 20:28.320
But Rohanna remains a normal, dark-haven woman. She stays with her husband and children,

20:28.720 --> 20:32.820
and though she sympathizes with the free Amazon, she speaks for the traditional women's role.

20:33.140 --> 20:35.180
We ask Bradley if she sympathizes with Rohanna.

20:36.060 --> 20:42.500
Of course I do, because I lived in a world where these restrictions became part of our lives,

20:42.500 --> 20:47.440
and a lot of, for instance, very liberated women.

20:48.020 --> 20:54.360
I would like very much to join them in many ways, but having taken on responsibilities,

20:54.900 --> 21:02.700
my kids are here. You can't divorce your children. You can't take back the commitments you've made.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.580
It's also true that this kind of freedom is not for everybody.

21:07.580 --> 21:12.160
I, for instance, would absolutely love to sail single-handed around the world,

21:12.240 --> 21:16.680
or climb Mount Everest, but I had children until I was too old to do so,

21:17.300 --> 21:24.660
and nowadays there is really no great reason for me to strike out and do this.

21:24.760 --> 21:31.680
I have a great deal of sympathy and admiration for people who can do these things, but I can't.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.920
Just as I think Rohanna had a great deal of admiration for the free Amazon,

21:35.920 --> 21:41.160
her attitude is, well, if I had known about this kind of thing when I was a young girl,

21:41.160 --> 21:46.780
instead of just believing all sorts of lies about them, I probably would have been one too,

21:46.800 --> 21:52.420
but it's too late for that, and I had another, you might say, that God had meant something else for me.

21:53.600 --> 21:57.420
But Bradley also presents the free Amazon with compassion and understanding.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.340
She tells us why they're important.

21:59.840 --> 22:09.780
I think the free Amazons were created out of my wish to realize that in a society so abnormally restrictive,

22:09.960 --> 22:13.640
there must be some kind of a safety valve where the society would blow to pieces.

22:13.940 --> 22:19.420
So there had to be some kind of an honorable alternative provided in the society for women,

22:19.700 --> 22:23.960
and for that matter for men who simply could not live under the pressures of that kind of society.

22:24.860 --> 22:28.980
We thought that feminist readers of the Shattered Chain would be pleased at the free Amazons

22:28.980 --> 22:32.220
in the way Bradley treats women in the novel, but Bradley says that isn't so.

22:32.820 --> 22:40.880
As a matter of fact, the real heavy feminists believe that I'm sort of a pussycat, a Mickey Mouse,

22:41.060 --> 22:45.180
because I don't go far enough in men hating.

22:45.660 --> 22:51.680
They said I didn't have the courage to go far enough and create a society where men had actually been eliminated,

22:51.680 --> 22:53.440
a true feminist society.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:03.120 --> 23:05.760
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

23:05.760 --> 23:08.980
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:14.140 --> 24:19.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.860
And here are your hosts.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.220
This is Daryl Lane.

24:29.360 --> 24:29.980
And Bill Vernon.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.340
Marion Zimmer Bradley is one of Science Fiction's most distinguished writers.

24:33.580 --> 24:36.480
She's been publishing Science Fiction in fantasy for 30 years,

24:36.700 --> 24:39.720
and her dark over novels have attracted a large following of readers.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.660
Today there are a large number of first class women writers in the field of Science Fiction,

24:43.940 --> 24:47.120
but when Bradley began publishing in the early 1950s, there weren't many around.

24:47.120 --> 24:51.140
And looking over a list of Science Fiction authors from the 40s and 50s in fact,

24:51.380 --> 24:53.620
it's hard to find more than a couple of women writers.

25:17.740 --> 25:19.860
There were a great many women in fantasy.

25:20.120 --> 25:25.440
It was just hard Science Fiction, which appealed mostly to young men and to engineering students,

25:25.600 --> 25:30.300
or so the editors fondly believed, where women were sort of taboo.

25:31.240 --> 25:36.080
It was like the audience was supposed to be young white males,

25:36.340 --> 25:39.520
and so it was like the audience for Western stories.

25:39.520 --> 25:46.040
The Embower, Bertha Bower, had to call herself just the Embower

25:46.040 --> 25:50.900
because they believed that the young cowboys who read the stuff

25:50.900 --> 25:53.940
would not be willing to read stuff by a person named Bertha,

25:54.060 --> 25:56.640
which sounded like a little old lady knitting socks.

25:57.880 --> 26:01.920
But she was one of the very best of Western writers,

26:02.100 --> 26:04.980
and eventually they were able to cope with it and let her be so.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.380
Bradley believes Science Fiction has changed in the time she's been in the field,

26:09.740 --> 26:12.520
and she thinks women writers have been partially responsible for the changes.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.320
We asked her what she thought some of the changes have been.

26:16.420 --> 26:19.820
Well, part of it is when I started writing it,

26:21.060 --> 26:26.640
it was once again, it was sort of technological daydreams for young engineering students.

26:27.240 --> 26:33.840
It's a lot about spaceships and journeys to the moon and the conquest of stars

26:33.840 --> 26:36.240
and gadgets and all that sort of thing.

26:37.540 --> 26:42.100
In the middle 40s, the work of Theodore Sturgeon and even more,

26:42.200 --> 26:46.640
the work of the Kuttner pair, and anybody who has read the books very seriously

26:46.640 --> 26:50.440
knows that Catherine was the dominant writer of that pair.

26:51.380 --> 26:55.360
C. L. Moore wrote a lot of the stuff with the Kuttner pen name on it

26:55.360 --> 26:59.060
because once again, the audience was supposed to be mostly male,

26:59.540 --> 27:03.220
and the two of them were working so closely together that they never cared

27:03.220 --> 27:06.220
who wrote a specific story, it was all just Kuttner and Moore.

27:07.220 --> 27:10.920
But a lot of the stories that appeared with Hank's name on it were Kuttners,

27:11.280 --> 27:17.100
and Catherine, like many women, is more interested in the effects of gadgets on people

27:17.100 --> 27:21.540
than she was in gadgets, and she almost single-handed reformed the whole field.

27:21.540 --> 27:25.800
There was a time during the 40s and early 50s when the Kuttners,

27:26.000 --> 27:30.080
when the two Kuttners wrote almost everything that appeared in the big magazines

27:30.900 --> 27:32.760
under a variety of pen names.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.860
They'd have three or four stories in an issue sometimes.

27:36.700 --> 27:44.960
And so gradually, also because Hank and Catherine were both preparing to work with psychology,

27:45.180 --> 27:48.600
they were both studying to be psychotherapists,

27:48.600 --> 27:51.880
they became very interested in the causes of people's behavior.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.680
This increased importance of behavior or psychology in science fiction,

27:56.060 --> 27:58.460
which Bradley credits C. L. Moore with helping bring about,

27:58.880 --> 28:01.180
also helps explain the popularity of fantasy today.

28:02.060 --> 28:08.160
I think the big change has been away from technology itself

28:08.160 --> 28:11.540
and into the effect which technology has on people,

28:11.700 --> 28:14.220
and then when you start delving into people's minds,

28:14.220 --> 28:19.720
what you come to is fantasy under which they cloak their deepest feelings and desires.

28:20.280 --> 28:25.100
You might say the very depths of their unconscious where nothing is censored.

28:26.160 --> 28:32.480
Fantasy is, you might say, the subconscious with the self-censor turned off.

28:33.600 --> 28:38.100
Bradley's own fiction is strong in characterization and in realistic human psychology.

28:38.580 --> 28:41.300
The people she creates are always believable and deep.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.300
But that doesn't mean her narratives are slow.

28:43.300 --> 28:44.960
She writes exciting science fiction.

29:15.560 --> 29:29.560
Thank you for watching.
