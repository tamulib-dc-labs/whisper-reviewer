WEBVTT

00:01.520 --> 00:09.380
Okay, I know that you are working on the, just my engineer pointing out something.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.880
Okay, Mad Max.

00:11.020 --> 00:13.480
I know that you're working on something that has to do with sanctuary.

00:13.820 --> 00:19.660
So tell us what sanctuary is and we can make a show out of what you say sanctuary is and

00:19.660 --> 00:21.180
then we'll talk about what you're doing on it.

00:21.460 --> 00:26.760
Lynn says that sanctuary, Lynn Abbey, one of my other offices, says that sanctuary is

00:26.760 --> 00:29.980
a state of mind recognized by the American Psychiatric Association.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.860
Sanctuary is a group effort.

00:33.780 --> 00:43.620
Rob Aspen created a geography, a god list with the help of Andy Offit and the other original

00:43.620 --> 00:49.220
contributors, a political situation and some base characters for this town.

00:50.220 --> 00:53.700
And it's called, one would say, I guess it's the armpit of fantasy.

00:55.500 --> 01:01.760
It's a black hole of Calcutta type town in which magic is operative and contract sorcery

01:01.760 --> 01:05.520
is as common as wash water.

01:06.820 --> 01:12.200
And then he farmed it out to a group of writers and initially everyone was supposed to just

01:12.200 --> 01:18.480
write their story within the frame plot of the town and make reference to other people's

01:18.480 --> 01:19.640
characters as walk-ons.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.180
And that's what happened for the first couple of volumes.

01:23.480 --> 01:28.960
But as we got to know each other, there became sort of a core group which decided where the

01:28.960 --> 01:33.860
volume was going to go and where we were going to end up in that volume, what was going to

01:33.860 --> 01:37.560
happen and bulletins would come out as to what was going on in the town at this particular

01:37.560 --> 01:38.020
time.

01:38.380 --> 01:42.100
And you would write your story and find somebody else to link your story up with.

01:42.260 --> 01:47.720
I mean, I did a story once and then Andy picked up right where I left off and wrote

01:47.720 --> 01:52.040
the rest of that section and somebody else came in before me so that we ended up writing

01:52.040 --> 01:55.540
sort of collaborative novels and they are really fun.

01:56.620 --> 02:03.120
They're to a large degree tongue-in-cheek and to some degree pretty serious.

02:03.700 --> 02:09.280
The philosophy is a lot of fun with them and my character is very philosophical.

02:11.260 --> 02:20.700
We take them from a group of historical periods which are allowable.

02:21.100 --> 02:27.580
We were supposed to stick to Iron Age, you know, and no farther into ADs and 100s, but

02:27.580 --> 02:32.800
someone came up with steel with the justification the Afghans had steel at 500 BC, so now we

02:32.800 --> 02:33.640
have low-grade steel.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.480
But it's not better than the good bronze.

02:35.480 --> 02:42.840
And I did the weapons and sent around a lot of material and other people sent material

02:42.840 --> 02:47.200
and other things and now we've invoked some more ancient guys.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.720
And for me, for my part, it's sort of fractured history.

02:50.380 --> 02:54.800
The Sacred Band in this book didn't get the Massacre by Alexander at New Chironia.

02:54.940 --> 02:55.480
It exists.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.780
It's alive and well in sanctuary.

02:57.300 --> 03:02.640
Every time I come across a historical character or a group of characters, I've got a really

03:02.640 --> 03:04.540
sad deal out of history.

03:04.740 --> 03:06.420
I stick them into the sanctuary construct.

03:07.360 --> 03:10.860
And the stories had done very well.

03:12.140 --> 03:17.320
The sanctuary story of the Peace World group had its own panel at a World Fantasy Con and

03:17.320 --> 03:18.460
then again at a World Con.

03:18.840 --> 03:26.140
And it spun off a war game, a board game, red miniatures, what else do we get?

03:26.240 --> 03:26.780
Paper dolls.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.080
All sorts of good stuff.

03:29.080 --> 03:34.060
So I spun off three novels from my characters that were in the story.

03:35.280 --> 03:39.240
And I turned in the first one to Berkeley and I had no idea what was going to be out.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.620
It's going to be out as a trade first.

03:41.460 --> 03:44.820
But they're just wonderful to write.

03:45.260 --> 03:46.380
They're so much fun.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.500
The magic is just wonderful to do.

03:49.580 --> 03:54.080
And I have all this ancient history background that I haven't been able to use in any of

03:54.080 --> 03:59.340
my science fiction or science fantasy because it really pertains to Earth.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.820
Little details and stuff that I've done up.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.820
I'm very strong from about 2,500 BC to about 300 BC.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.800
I have a lot of information.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.240
I read a lot of dead languages.

04:11.920 --> 04:17.560
So I started to do this group of three novels, which is going to take care of the war that

04:17.560 --> 04:24.060
we started in the group thing, but couldn't handle in the group area because all the

04:24.060 --> 04:26.920
group stories have to take place in the sanctuary in this town.

04:27.420 --> 04:28.320
And the war is in the north.

04:29.100 --> 04:34.940
So my characters and his friends go north and they deal with other parts of the continent

04:34.940 --> 04:36.240
and what's going on there.

04:36.840 --> 04:44.060
And there's the same kind of running conflict between science and magic.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.060
But in this case, magic is the science.

04:46.340 --> 04:50.080
And the magic of the science magic thing become the gods.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.320
So we have the gods on one side and the magicians on the other side, logic on one side,

04:54.420 --> 04:55.440
faith on the other side.

04:56.060 --> 05:00.800
And my character is constantly regenerating himself, my lead character.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.740
So he can't die, but he's just miserable.

05:03.000 --> 05:03.640
He's so unhappy.

05:05.460 --> 05:10.940
And I know who he's a real character from Earth history, but I'm not saying who until

05:10.940 --> 05:11.820
the end of his book.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.820
Those of you that are familiar with ancient history will know who he is from the quotes

05:15.820 --> 05:17.000
and those who aren't.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.280
Well, but I just love to do this.

05:20.460 --> 05:21.520
They are so much fun.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.740
They are like a paid vacation and they've had very good responses.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.260
Everybody seems to like them.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.700
I get a lot of letters about the characters.

05:31.660 --> 05:32.940
It's a wooden sorcery.

05:33.060 --> 05:36.060
The Homeric tradition is very dear to my heart.

05:36.120 --> 05:36.580
I love it.

05:36.660 --> 05:38.140
I don't think it needs any justification.

05:38.560 --> 05:43.260
I think that those values ought to be brought to people's attention once again.

05:43.260 --> 05:50.500
And Homer was writing fantasy for in his days, writing about something 800 years in his own

05:50.500 --> 05:54.140
past when he was writing about the siege of Troy.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.760
So I'm in good company to do them.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.960
And they're the pure, the first pure fantasy that I've done.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.860
So I'm having a ball with it.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.520
It's really uplifting to do it.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.300
Very free.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.560
No terrible breaks to find out.

06:09.560 --> 06:13.260
This is that because I already know pretty much the background that I'm going to use.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.760
And they're just invigorating my side.

06:16.900 --> 06:17.400
I just love it.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.140
I've got a real simple yes or no question for you.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.240
Why is fantasy getting so popular today?

06:27.820 --> 06:33.680
We talked about the fact that not that many people really, when it comes down to it like hard science

06:33.680 --> 06:38.040
and hard science fiction and all of a sudden fantasy is very popular more so than ever.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.240
What's your idea on why it's popular?

06:40.720 --> 06:42.200
Well, you'd be glad to hear that.

06:42.500 --> 06:48.500
And from what I hear from the publishers it's turning around right now that there's more interest now in science fiction

06:48.500 --> 06:49.940
or what is called science fiction.

06:50.060 --> 06:56.300
I don't know if Star Trek 2 is technically science fiction, but things with the trappings of science fiction

06:56.300 --> 06:59.200
because of ET and Star Trek and those various things.

06:59.660 --> 07:03.420
So the editors and publishers now are looking for things that they can label science fiction.

07:03.420 --> 07:08.740
But I think that happened partially from the influx of Lady Rears.

07:10.460 --> 07:13.340
I don't know if you remember the real old days of science fiction,

07:13.460 --> 07:20.820
but I remember when a science fiction meeting of a group at Boston called the International Interplanetary Exploration Society

07:20.820 --> 07:30.920
with Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clark, Charles Clemens, one guy didn't know and me, I was 13.

07:31.720 --> 07:35.460
So it was all pretty much boys night out.

07:36.600 --> 07:42.980
And in the last few years women in fantasy, you know, the princess in the tower, all of that old stuff,

07:44.020 --> 07:47.380
had a resurgence.

07:47.960 --> 07:54.100
I don't know what people see in things like the Lepper books.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.280
I don't remember the Donaldson things.

07:56.280 --> 08:01.400
I truly do not understand why people like that sort of book. He's a very nice guy.

08:01.860 --> 08:03.580
And Lord knows I have tried.

08:04.580 --> 08:12.500
But the good and evil archetypal thing, I think it goes along with, you know, back to the earth and fundamentalism

08:12.500 --> 08:19.300
and creationism and all of this kind of rejection of the modern world and back to a simpler age.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.820
But I do also think that it's sort of over now in that sense.

08:22.820 --> 08:30.080
And the kind of fantasy that we're writing is not that kind of high fantasy, which is pretty intense.

08:30.620 --> 08:36.900
And I mean, this is mean and nasty and get down with lots of ancient weaponry and, you know,

08:37.200 --> 08:42.220
the proper siege engine for the period and times, more like an ancient historical.

08:43.140 --> 08:47.800
But I think they went over to fantasy from romance.

08:47.800 --> 08:53.020
I mean, if you look at the definition of romance in a dictionary, you'll see that in general,

08:53.080 --> 08:57.460
most dictionaries define it as a story that takes place in an exotic locale,

08:57.960 --> 09:00.020
which indeed is what science fiction is, too.

09:00.780 --> 09:03.520
But the romance element in fantasy is much greater.

09:04.100 --> 09:09.940
And also it's simple. As far as writers producing it, it's a very simple form to produce badly.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.980
So a lot of young writers try to start out there.

09:12.980 --> 09:17.980
You get a lot of first novels in fantasy.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.580
I mean, I've commented a couple of times on first novels that were fantasy novels,

09:23.740 --> 09:28.760
because usually one applies a different standard to a first novel.

09:28.960 --> 09:35.180
At least I'm willing to apply a different standard and will accept less from somebody's first novel

09:35.180 --> 09:37.160
than I will put somebody later on.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.620
And my standards for fantasy are lower.

09:40.840 --> 09:45.060
I would like them to give me a good rise, take me in place, remove me from the scene,

09:45.560 --> 09:48.040
and just not strain my credibility too very much.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.760
And that's all I want from fantasy.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.920
But I don't have time to read much of it anymore.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.300
And I hear it's getting very, very bad.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.840
But I hear this from other writers.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.740
So I don't know. Writers are very jealous.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.120
That's just probably a brilliant...

10:01.120 --> 10:03.520
So maybe it's not getting as bad as I think it is,

10:03.520 --> 10:07.240
but there certainly are an awful lot of books out there that say fantasy on them.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.720
I can't argue with you about that.

10:09.200 --> 10:17.900
It does take a certain amount more preparation to write science fiction.

10:18.080 --> 10:23.440
One can write fantasy with just the amount of pristine mysticism one has picked up

10:24.440 --> 10:30.100
by growing up in the Midwest or wherever one has grown up and gone to spending school.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.860
We're a good fantasy, an ancient fantasy,

10:32.960 --> 10:38.180
one that has some other cultural bias or a piece of science fiction,

10:38.760 --> 10:40.100
takes a little more literacy.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.920
And I just think it's an easy place for them to start.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.500
Why the readers keep buying bad books.

10:45.620 --> 10:48.880
And I said in an interview once that everybody that gets a bad book,

10:48.940 --> 10:50.120
she sends it back to the publisher.

10:50.740 --> 10:52.920
And I think if we all send all the bad books back,

10:53.240 --> 10:55.100
you know, now I ask my money back, just send them back,

10:55.640 --> 10:59.200
that there be less bad books, that they get tired of receiving them all

10:59.200 --> 11:00.860
and then they would eventually get the message.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.800
But that's about the only thing you can do.

11:03.920 --> 11:08.440
You can refuse to buy a bad book or a book that doesn't meet your standards.

11:08.540 --> 11:13.340
But if you buy it, you've done them a favor and you'll continue the problem.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.220
I don't want literature to become like television.

11:17.540 --> 11:20.640
I don't want it to keep thinking, you know, level by level,

11:20.820 --> 11:23.960
so that they used to talk about, you know, you're writing for 12-year-old.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.880
Now they're talking about you're writing for an 8-year-old.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.800
When I start, they start telling me I have to write for a 6-year-old.

11:28.900 --> 11:29.480
I haven't had a business.

11:30.060 --> 11:30.900
I cannot write.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.280
I write down.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.560
I have to believe that the reader out there is right with me.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.840
And I think fantasy writers, almost without exception, write down.

11:40.200 --> 11:44.640
They write to a level, below the level that they're thinking on.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.180
And I don't think that's healthy.

11:48.140 --> 11:52.800
When we interviewed Pears Anthony, he said, I asked him a similar question,

11:52.800 --> 11:56.500
he said that when he wants to write for fun,

11:56.820 --> 11:58.720
what he really enjoys writing is science fiction.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.820
But when he wants to make money, he writes fantasy.

12:01.420 --> 12:06.660
And I guess that's the way it is now, that that's where the money is.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.380
That, I don't know.

12:08.500 --> 12:14.280
I got a lot more money for the carrying books, right?

12:15.140 --> 12:19.180
When I had thought one could get for science fiction.

12:19.180 --> 12:22.760
So, I mean, the books went to auction here, and then they went to auction in England,

12:22.900 --> 12:25.420
and then I sold them in Germany, and I'm getting a portion.

12:26.620 --> 12:36.640
Now, to have enough extra money to do that, it says something good as to what a publisher is willing to risk in science fiction.

12:36.780 --> 12:37.720
And the books are running out.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.240
So somebody's buying them.

12:39.260 --> 12:48.240
I don't know what kind of money he's talking about, but I do know that he's been getting on the best dollar list with books that seem to be written exclusively

12:48.240 --> 12:51.060
for an audience of fans, which I find very strange.

12:53.820 --> 12:56.000
Nightmares and like that, those are his, right?

12:56.680 --> 12:57.080
Right.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.340
I don't read that anymore.

12:59.500 --> 13:04.700
I used to read his things when he was doing wonderful stuff, way back.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.540
I don't know if you read the one about the dinosaur or the, and the bird.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.800
He had one of, out of a great bird.

13:11.340 --> 13:12.520
Yeah, was that a horn?

13:12.800 --> 13:12.980
A horn.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.020
It was wonderful.

13:14.400 --> 13:14.880
I wept.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.220
I just loved it.

13:16.220 --> 13:27.540
Um, any writer in any area has to fight losing their edge, letting creative pressure cause you to write something you don't want to write.

13:28.460 --> 13:32.280
Because of the way I write, I can't, I don't have that problem.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.500
That can't happen to me because I can't manufacture a story.

13:36.060 --> 13:38.820
I get us either a story is there for me or it isn't.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.320
I can't just sit down and say, okay, you know, I need to make some money.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.040
If I'm going to write a story and it's going to be about this and that.

13:44.040 --> 13:55.820
I have to get interested and then I go into an excessive state and the sanctuary things, even though there's fantasy, allowed me to do what I couldn't do otherwise.

13:56.180 --> 14:00.920
If you think the market for science fiction is difficult, you should try the market for a serious historical.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.560
Um, that is a very difficult market to write.

14:04.980 --> 14:13.180
There hasn't been good money for books like that since the 50s and that's when all good ones were written like Margaret Yorsenor and those kinds of quality.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.820
Historically, no one is doing it anymore.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.360
It almost cannot be done.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.420
Creation was just the exception to the rule of the glorified hour books.

14:22.680 --> 14:26.940
I promised the sanctuary characters that they would just stay in these little tiny spaces.

14:27.140 --> 14:28.220
I would get them their own deal.

14:28.780 --> 14:29.360
So I did.

14:29.580 --> 14:33.380
I got them a deal for three books and they're very happy and they're giving me good book back.

14:34.020 --> 14:37.460
But I can't, I just couldn't, I wouldn't know where to start to create.

14:37.460 --> 14:47.820
Um, that's why I don't write for magazines because they're looking for you to write in a particular slot and to create almost a little joke that short story for men.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.140
I don't care for it.

14:50.520 --> 14:59.240
I think if you write an honest book and you have something to say that the readership that I want will find it.

14:59.240 --> 15:07.660
And that's all I'm asking because, you know, there's always a silhouette romance for somebody who can't read my stuff.

15:08.220 --> 15:12.800
And I don't pretend to write for everybody.

15:13.020 --> 15:20.440
And if I get a bestseller and we've got 120,000 out of Earthdreams, if we got 150, we might get the New York Times list.

15:21.120 --> 15:32.000
But, um, the last volume of the Seaswell Things, which was called the Storm Season, was on the top 50 at Dalton's and Lawton's books nationwide when it came out.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.400
And it's a phenomena.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.320
It just happens.

15:34.900 --> 15:41.260
I don't think you can sit down and plan to write a book that will be both a good book and a book that will be a bestseller.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.400
I don't think you can make that many compromises.

15:43.920 --> 15:54.540
And if a writer loses their edge for making money, right, things that they don't believe in, and writes books for the wrong reason, it's his trade-off.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.400
In the end, you're not alive and your books are there.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.160
And that's what's left.

15:59.100 --> 16:03.680
And I tend to want to write for a building a corpus of words that I think has some value.

16:03.940 --> 16:06.800
I mean, you're getting into people's heads with the hell of an opportunity to waste.

16:07.360 --> 16:19.740
Somebody takes the time and the effort to sit down and read your book, not only go out and find it, but bring it home and turn off the TV and shut up the kids and, you know, let the guard out and read your book.

16:20.360 --> 16:24.660
It's a tremendous, almost an honor.

16:24.900 --> 16:33.240
I love it that people read your books, let you into their heads, become one with you for that amount of time.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.860
And you ought to have something to offer, something to give them.

16:36.900 --> 16:45.360
We do occasionally other things, other pseudonyms, political things, espionage, politics, stuff I know about intelligence gathering.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.160
And in a book like that, one has to pay attention to formula.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.300
You have to have a certain amount of action in a book.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.700
But I also try to have, you know, a certain amount of action in my fiction because I think story.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.360
You should never lose sight of the fact that there has to be story.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.680
But to write just for money.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.320
I've never tried to do it that way.

17:08.620 --> 17:12.860
I write what I want to write and then I try to get money for it afterwards.

17:13.860 --> 17:15.160
I wouldn't know where to start.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.120
It's just, he's probably written many more books than I am.

17:19.700 --> 17:20.960
And how, is he older?

17:21.760 --> 17:26.700
I think he's about, I think he's pretty close to 50, yeah.

17:26.700 --> 17:30.000
Yeah, I think at that point one's trying to cover one's best too.

17:30.460 --> 17:31.480
And more power to him.

17:31.500 --> 17:36.000
The more books that do well, the better off everybody is in this market.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.200
Books of any sort.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.240
It's just nice to know that people are reading.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.700
But again, I haven't read those books.

17:42.860 --> 17:45.880
I don't know whether they have good content or they don't have good content.

17:46.020 --> 17:49.420
But I do say if somebody wants to write science fiction, they should be writing science fiction.

17:50.020 --> 17:52.080
Because we don't have enough, and he's a good writer.

17:52.080 --> 17:58.360
Or it was when I read him at the time of the war and things like that.

17:58.540 --> 17:59.660
He was a good, strong writer.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.560
And it's just a bad state of affairs that that is indeed still the case.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.180
Okay, that's my list of questions.

18:11.580 --> 18:12.820
Thanks very much.

18:12.880 --> 18:13.820
It's been very enjoyable.

18:14.200 --> 18:19.140
I enjoyed, I only interview people whom I enjoy reading their books.

18:19.140 --> 18:23.720
And I don't interview anybody who I don't read and who I don't like their stuff.

18:23.840 --> 18:30.000
So it's a pleasure to kind of get into your head too after you're being in my head for so long.

18:30.240 --> 18:30.800
It's wonderful.

18:31.260 --> 18:31.540
Great.

18:31.580 --> 18:32.680
I agree, but I had a great time.

18:32.840 --> 18:37.000
This was the most free that I've been able to be with somebody.

18:37.500 --> 18:37.900
Well good.

18:38.740 --> 18:46.480
Let me ask you if it would be any trouble if I could send my carrying books to you with postage and all that stuff.

18:46.740 --> 18:47.680
And have you signed them?

18:47.680 --> 18:48.400
Oh, certainly.

18:49.120 --> 18:54.300
And if there's room, stick the Xerox, if that's convenient.

18:54.560 --> 18:54.980
Absolutely.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.780
Okay, I would appreciate that.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.600
I'm a book collector, which is how I got into science fiction.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.840
I think I'm a couple of years younger than you.

19:02.060 --> 19:03.400
I was born in 1948.

19:03.780 --> 19:04.600
Yeah, I'm 46.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.940
So right in there, that's the plot.

19:07.220 --> 19:07.860
Yeah, right.

19:08.060 --> 19:11.900
So we kind of went through the same social time.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.940
I used to live in New York for a while.

19:15.100 --> 19:20.620
We lived in upstate New York and stayed down in the village for most of one summer.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.340
And we had a really good time up there.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.640
And I like that part of the country.

19:24.760 --> 19:28.640
I only came back to Texas because of economic exigencies.

19:29.900 --> 19:34.760
But it's kind of nice out here because we do have a radio show out here who would have thunked that.

19:35.780 --> 19:36.300
I think it's good.

19:36.360 --> 19:39.720
Well, I think you have to go to New York and then you have to leave New York.

19:39.720 --> 19:45.540
Everybody should have the experience, but no one should be sentenced there for any long period of time.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.780
I mean, I don't think I could be as creative there.

19:48.060 --> 19:51.120
There's some noisy, mental noise and a lot of noise there.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.100
Yeah, I can appreciate that.

19:54.820 --> 19:58.660
Okay, I'll get you my books one of these days and I'll try to get them out pretty fast.

19:58.760 --> 19:59.880
I do appreciate that.

20:01.540 --> 20:07.480
I'll write the shows probably sometime in February and we'll voice them over and get you copies of them.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.980
And I sure look forward to seeing what you put out.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.560
I'll have to read the sanctuary stuff.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.720
I have not read that because I did read Donaldson.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.020
I do try to read some fantasy, but I just flat don't enjoy it as much.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.060
Did you enjoy that, Donaldson?

20:22.520 --> 20:23.520
No, I did not.

20:23.880 --> 20:24.600
You're just reading.

20:24.900 --> 20:25.440
I did it.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.180
I read it.

20:27.420 --> 20:34.940
In fact, just between me and you and the gatepost, I think the three of us are going to flip a coin and whoever loses gets to interview him.

20:34.940 --> 20:36.340
Although he's a hell of a nice guy.

20:36.500 --> 20:41.260
I mean, if he really is, but I just don't think I'm up to doing an interview on that stuff.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.360
I wouldn't know what to ask.

20:42.460 --> 20:42.780
I know.

20:42.960 --> 20:43.760
That's the problem.

20:43.900 --> 20:44.420
What can you say?

20:44.560 --> 20:48.080
One of our guys is an English professor, Tolkien scholar and all that.

20:48.300 --> 20:49.080
Maybe he could do it.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.780
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping he loses.

20:52.140 --> 20:56.400
But again, I really look forward to seeing what you put out in the future.

20:57.640 --> 21:04.200
Listen, if you would return it within a year, I'll also send you the Cura Zini book.

21:05.860 --> 21:06.320
Oh, sure.

21:06.560 --> 21:06.900
Okay.

21:07.120 --> 21:07.380
Yeah.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.160
I've finished.

21:08.420 --> 21:09.760
I've been through it and I've got a dog ear.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.060
You'll have to deal with my dog ear.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.600
Oh yeah, no problem whatsoever.

21:12.880 --> 21:13.780
I appreciate that.

21:14.580 --> 21:15.420
Yeah, okay.

21:15.660 --> 21:18.720
I will send enough postage to cover that then and all that.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.040
I don't want you to be out anything.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.400
That's a very nice gesture.

21:22.900 --> 21:23.240
Okay.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.760
Janet, it's been really nice.

21:26.100 --> 21:29.220
Thanks for conceding and we'll talk to you later, I'm sure.

21:29.320 --> 21:30.000
I'll be enjoying it.

21:30.220 --> 21:30.880
Bye bye now.

21:31.320 --> 21:31.820
Bye bye.
