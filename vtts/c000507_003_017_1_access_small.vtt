00:01.520 --> 00:06.040
Okay, the tape is now on, so I'll start out by asking you a little bit about your background

00:06.040 --> 00:08.420
and what in it might have led you to write science fiction.

00:10.900 --> 00:14.760
Oh, well now you've asked a double barrel question there.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.160
Answer away.

00:16.660 --> 00:22.540
The second part derives out of the first, and maybe there's no connection in background

00:22.540 --> 00:25.580
in what led me to write science fiction.

00:25.580 --> 00:37.640
In the first place, my big brother, Billy, I got to diverge a little bit here.

00:38.040 --> 00:38.500
That's fine.

00:38.740 --> 00:40.580
Have you read anything I've written?

00:41.300 --> 00:43.080
I've read everything you've written.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.940
Good God, I don't think I've done that myself.

00:46.940 --> 00:54.840
But all right, my big brother is involved in various of my stories.

00:56.560 --> 01:04.540
The one which, the most recent, is the little paperback novel, The Catalyst.

01:06.580 --> 01:13.340
And he is one of the principal characters in there, although he is dead.

01:14.540 --> 01:24.560
And he comes back in a very spectacular way as a result of an incredible chemical experiment.

01:25.360 --> 01:33.280
Anyhow, my big brother, Billy, that was our family name for him.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.520
His real name was Blanford Brian Hornets.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.540
And he was my idol.

01:42.160 --> 01:47.380
And he got all the amazing story magazines.

01:48.760 --> 01:56.720
He got Weird Tales from the drug store, which I guess they don't publish anymore, but back

01:56.720 --> 01:59.100
in the middle 20s they did.

02:00.260 --> 02:07.400
And Weird Tales had the original stories by Lovecraft.

02:08.880 --> 02:15.140
And I forget the name of the guy that writes Conan, but they had some of his short stories in it too.

02:16.440 --> 02:20.340
And anyhow, he got me interested in it.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.060
I would borrow his copies surreptitiously and read them.

02:24.060 --> 02:36.960
And also, he had a few of the Edgar Rice Burr's books, the Mars books, the first couple of Tarzan books, and so on.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.880
And these were remarkable things.

02:40.860 --> 02:48.220
I think A Princess of Mars is one of the best adventure stories ever written.

02:48.220 --> 02:55.200
And I've read it many times trying to analyze how Burr has made certain of his points.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.860
It's beautifully pace, suspenseful.

03:01.820 --> 03:07.340
It develops instant sympathy with the characters and so on.

03:08.380 --> 03:10.920
Anyhow, that was a good one, and I read that.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.940
So I had read what there was to offer.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.620
Well, there were other stories too.

03:18.920 --> 03:32.480
In Argos, some of the Edgar Rice Burr's stories were published as serials, like The Chestnut of Mars and other things by Burrosen by other people too.

03:33.360 --> 03:46.560
And my brother Billy also had H.G. Wells' books, The Time Machine, and I think it was called 30 Strange Stories.

03:47.520 --> 03:53.920
He had the Charles Fort books, Low and Book of the Damned, and so on.

03:54.660 --> 03:58.640
So I picked up a smattering of the stuff, and it was very exciting.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.800
And it was just a pleasure to read.

04:04.880 --> 04:14.440
I will mention here right away that one of my big disappointments in life was my trip to the Fort Worth Public Library.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.660
This is when I was 10 or 12 years old.

04:18.160 --> 04:25.420
See if I could find some of the books of Edgar Rice Burr's, and nobody there had ever heard of him.

04:26.220 --> 04:31.300
So, well, I knew then that the world was divided into two kinds of people.

04:32.280 --> 04:44.520
And I might never meet friends of Edgar Rice Burr's, or of Tarzan, or of John Carter, or Dejah Thoris in the Fort Worth Public Library.

04:45.220 --> 04:46.760
But I got other things there.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.860
Anyhow, that was the background.

04:50.600 --> 04:56.340
And my brother Billy was several years older than I. In fact, he was nine years older than I.

04:57.260 --> 05:02.780
And he died when I was just about to graduate from high school.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.920
And he had tumors of the brain, which in those days were inoperable.

05:08.180 --> 05:08.920
Today they don't.

05:09.920 --> 05:15.260
It wouldn't be too much trouble to operate if they couldn't do it then.

05:16.160 --> 05:21.880
Well, I have remembered him, and I had never let him go.

05:23.300 --> 05:27.400
And he has been in several of my stories.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.820
The Ring of Wretcher and the Old, I don't know whether you've ever heard of that or not.

05:32.940 --> 05:33.420
Oh, yes.

05:34.060 --> 05:41.440
Anyhow, he was the brother who was destroyed by the chief bad guy.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.020
But his brain was retained.

05:44.020 --> 05:45.520
He was the poet.

05:46.380 --> 05:54.800
His name was Omer, which of course is taken from Hammer, which is great for blind men.

05:56.260 --> 06:00.900
Anyhow, the two brothers were united at the end of the story.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.920
So that was sort of an idealized fantasy.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.220
Well, I had never written anything at all.

06:12.620 --> 06:20.060
I was working in Washington as a mineral economist during the war.

06:20.520 --> 06:30.620
I'm going to law school, and my daughter was born in 1946,

06:30.620 --> 06:35.100
and there were some bills to be paid, and we needed the money.

06:35.100 --> 06:41.340
So I sat down and wrote my first science fiction story, which was Time Trap.

06:42.380 --> 06:46.560
And this was bought by what was then a standing.

06:49.660 --> 06:54.080
And I thought, well, gee, do they pay money for this stuff?

06:54.440 --> 06:59.080
So I thought perhaps I should turn after more of it, which I did.

07:00.540 --> 07:08.120
So I wrote for a while until my daughter got old enough to demand more and more of my time.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.020
So the writing had to come to an end.

07:12.380 --> 07:17.480
And it didn't really resume again until she was ready to go off to college.

07:18.220 --> 07:22.300
This was in 1964, and I picked it up again.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.840
And I've been writing ever since.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.920
That restart, as you might say.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.040
So that's the background of it.

07:33.700 --> 07:41.580
And I'm retired now, and I retired at the beginning of last year, January 4, 1982.

07:42.740 --> 07:49.100
The last day at work, when I've been writing a little bit off and on since then.

07:49.820 --> 07:54.840
And I have a few items out floating around with Scott Meredith, who is my agent at the moment.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.200
And here I am.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.260
May I call you, Bill?

08:00.440 --> 08:01.320
Please do.

08:01.900 --> 08:02.940
Okay, I'm Charlie.

08:03.620 --> 08:04.220
Thank you.

08:04.520 --> 08:10.260
Bill, I've been talking and talking and talking, and you've asked only one and a half questions.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.040
So the ratio of talk to questions is really getting out of hand.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.840
So try another question.

08:17.180 --> 08:17.660
Okay.

08:18.080 --> 08:23.320
What I want to do now is ask you some specific questions about your works and kind of see how they evolved.

08:24.160 --> 08:32.420
You wrote Time Trap, which was a story, and it had the time loops and the gradual awakening of a Superman, that sort of thing.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.800
And these elements were common in your later work.

08:35.640 --> 08:40.840
Were those themes something you picked up unconsciously, or was this something you were striving for in your work?

08:41.680 --> 08:43.460
Well, it must have been unconscious.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.680
This has been pointed out, or some conscious.

08:46.220 --> 08:47.360
I don't know which is your artwork.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.840
This has been pointed out to me before.

08:52.660 --> 08:58.080
It's perhaps a mystical striving, and I don't know where it comes from.

08:59.660 --> 09:09.940
I did, or maybe you must have known, I did go to a ministerial school at TCU at one time.

09:10.580 --> 09:11.860
This was long, long ago.

09:12.740 --> 09:16.380
And they threw me out for reasons I won't go into here.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.720
But it was a wise decision.

09:19.640 --> 09:24.200
But I've never lost a mystic plant to pop things.

09:25.960 --> 09:31.000
And not all of my stories have this supernatural information.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.900
Some are quite logical and down to earth.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.980
Some do, some don't.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.900
Have you read the nation court?

09:40.900 --> 09:42.180
Yes, I have.

09:42.460 --> 09:45.460
Well, now that is down to earth as you can get.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.540
It has nothing.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.020
Well, maybe, I don't know, maybe it has the computer.

09:54.240 --> 09:58.520
Yeah, he's not straight, dialectic materialism.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.860
Well, who knows?

10:03.340 --> 10:05.980
I don't have a good answer to your question.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.660
No, that's fine.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.740
If the fact that it isn't, and just as an aside, not part of the interview,

10:12.120 --> 10:15.900
I think it's that mystical quality in your work which really appeals to me,

10:15.920 --> 10:21.400
because later on when we get into the rose, that's where I really can go.

10:21.820 --> 10:25.060
But first I want to bring up Flight Into Yesteryear, which was a novel.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.780
How did you decide to, I mean, you tackled a short story and now,

10:28.820 --> 10:29.760
suddenly you wrote a novel.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.880
Was that a pretty big decision to write a novel?

10:31.880 --> 10:35.500
Yeah, I needed a lot of money in a hurry.

10:36.800 --> 10:41.980
We had, I had finished law school past the DC bar,

10:43.060 --> 10:50.960
and got my first job as a patent attorney with American Sign Amid Company in Sanford, Connecticut.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.980
And housing was short.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.320
We were renting a little house up in Connecticut.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.360
And we were going to get evicted, it turned out.

11:04.480 --> 11:09.780
The lady wanted to sell her house, and we were looking around, we were desperate for a house.

11:10.920 --> 11:17.760
And it seemed to me the best way to scrape up the down payment for a house or else

11:18.560 --> 11:23.200
kept get the money for it to rent one that I could afford would be the right novel.

11:24.840 --> 11:34.200
So one thing led to another, and I sat down in just about two months of weekend work.

11:37.340 --> 11:40.900
You call it Flight Into Yesteryear, I'll get to that in a minute.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.040
That's not the right title.

11:43.860 --> 11:50.140
But anyhow, I wrote it very quickly, typed it up, got it over to Wander Stories,

11:51.620 --> 11:59.640
which is it was in combination with Starling Stories, which was edited by Sam Mervin.

12:00.920 --> 12:11.800
And this was, let me see what year it is, 40, 48, yes, 1948, about October 1, 1948.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.440
And a week later he sent a check in the mail.

12:17.440 --> 12:26.460
Now originally it was 45,000 words, which is the length they wanted for a novel in one of their magazines.

12:27.720 --> 12:31.200
And then later on it was expanded into a book.

12:32.760 --> 12:38.560
The original title, Bill, was nothing you've ever heard.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.580
It was Toyn B22.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.180
Toyn B22, after the ship?

12:46.380 --> 12:51.640
Yes. You have heard of course of the historian Arnold Toyn B.

12:52.120 --> 12:52.420
Yes.

12:52.700 --> 13:01.060
And his 21 civilizations, of which the western I think is either the 20th or the 21st.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.080
And what's the next one after that?

13:04.420 --> 13:08.280
He doesn't say, but it would logically have to be the 22nd.

13:09.190 --> 13:19.680
So we're talking here about the next civilization, or fall of civilization, following the 21st, the Toyn B. 21st civilization.

13:20.660 --> 13:23.880
So I call the little novel Toyn B22.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.920
Mervin went through the roof.

13:28.060 --> 13:31.280
He said, nobody will understand Toyn B22.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.120
Whose Toyn B?

13:33.560 --> 13:37.340
I renamed it to be Flight in the Yesterday.

13:38.120 --> 13:43.300
Of course that does wrap up the time traveling backwards angle.

13:44.760 --> 13:57.480
When it came out as a pocketbook later on, I believe the Walheims of Ace changed it to paradox men.

13:57.480 --> 14:08.700
With an explanation in the fly leave of why everybody was a paradox because he could never do what he wanted to or something.

14:09.560 --> 14:10.500
Which is okay.

14:10.740 --> 14:17.960
It was a teasing type of title and I guess it stayed paradox men from then on out.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.700
So that's how it got the title.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.140
Now, what else about it?

14:24.140 --> 14:40.260
Okay, you apparently dashed this off in a couple of months and yet the characters which really make the book are deeply drawn and they're alive and they're smart and they're not really cardboard characters like so many of the science fiction characters of that era were.

14:40.820 --> 14:43.940
Where did you get this knack for developing the characters as you do?

14:44.840 --> 14:47.100
Well, I lie a lot, Bill.

14:47.560 --> 14:51.920
I can see these guys and I can project them.

14:53.060 --> 15:05.320
And I make up stories and here they are acting characters and I can see their faces and the glints in their eyes and the curl, the sneery curl of their lips.

15:05.620 --> 15:12.380
If they're bad guys or they're sharp and take a breath and the hero sees the disaster looming.

15:14.440 --> 15:19.200
Actually, a lot, a lot of people, there's no big deal.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.140
But thank you for the compliment.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.820
Nobody's ever told me that they were other than cardboard characters.

15:26.620 --> 15:27.960
No, they definitely are.

15:31.300 --> 15:39.800
Okay, now this is where I have to get reverent because the Rose came out and the Rose as far as I'm concerned is the best science fiction book that's ever written.

15:41.900 --> 15:49.680
First thing I got to ask you about it is why did it appear, why was it first published in this obscure British magazine authentic?

15:50.480 --> 15:51.800
How did it ever end up there?

15:52.120 --> 15:55.060
Well, that's easy because nobody here would buy it.

15:56.520 --> 16:02.940
My agent at the time, Forest Aquaman of, I think, Los Angeles, fattled it around here and there.

16:03.340 --> 16:05.440
Nobody in this country would buy it.

16:05.440 --> 16:11.780
It went to John Camel and he wrote a nice two-line letter package.

16:11.940 --> 16:12.640
He just couldn't use it.

16:13.100 --> 16:22.480
It wasn't the kind of thing that any science fiction magazine or fantasy and science fiction magazine was publishing at the time.

16:22.820 --> 16:25.280
And I should have known better for writing it.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.040
But I wanted to write it, so I did.

16:29.620 --> 16:37.720
And finally Aquaman sold it to this little authentic magazine in England and they published it.

16:37.980 --> 16:41.060
And then after that it began to get some circulation.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.780
Michael Murcock picked it up for compact books.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.820
That's a schedule, I think, something like that.

16:50.660 --> 16:54.960
Anyhow, they put out a little paperback.

16:54.960 --> 16:59.220
Then in England they came out in a couple of hardcover editions.

16:59.960 --> 17:04.800
And then in this country, Berkeley, it may still be in front of Berkeley.

17:05.140 --> 17:07.660
That's a little royalty check just last year.

17:10.020 --> 17:15.900
So it didn't come out here first because its time had not arrived.

17:17.440 --> 17:21.180
You had written before for money because you needed the money.

17:21.360 --> 17:24.180
And you wrote this when you said because you wanted to write it.

17:24.180 --> 17:26.560
What was it about this book that you wanted to write?

17:27.740 --> 17:34.120
Well, really, Jacques, again, resembles my brother a great deal.

17:38.720 --> 17:51.760
And if you can visualize that guy with his sarcasm, his biting wit, his contempt for all the...

17:52.760 --> 18:06.440
Well, I don't know, but he had a high personal integrity and a impatience with convention and so on.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.240
At least in his head he did.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.100
And I wanted to get him into print.

18:16.740 --> 18:23.800
And of course Anna van Thou is me, although I had to take on a female form to make it effective.

18:25.200 --> 18:32.820
At one time I would have been pleased to die if it would bring him back.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.300
But of course that was just being said.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.960
But it was a thought and it was a psychic force driving the story.

18:45.540 --> 18:51.980
You talked at length in this book about the enmity between science and art.

18:52.880 --> 18:57.760
Is that something that you feel exists or has existed before?

18:59.280 --> 19:03.140
Oh, I suppose so. It's not a big thing to know.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.580
There is always a question.

19:09.220 --> 19:11.540
What take a university?

19:12.580 --> 19:15.500
They have a budget. Does it go into the physics department?

19:15.820 --> 19:18.100
Your department? The chemistry department?

19:18.420 --> 19:21.180
Or will they establish a chair part?

19:21.960 --> 19:25.740
Or teaching the Renaissance in Italy?

19:26.480 --> 19:29.220
Or the old masters, the painters?

19:29.940 --> 19:31.440
Or they have a music school?

19:32.280 --> 19:34.860
Or where does it get divided up?

19:34.860 --> 19:36.220
There is a conflict.

19:38.800 --> 19:43.080
At the time I wrote that I think there was a bigger conflict than there is now.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.620
I think science was one at least, temporarily.

19:48.600 --> 19:53.520
Thirty years ago it wasn't at all clear. That was not too clear.

19:55.500 --> 19:59.500
The ending of that book was very moving.

19:59.500 --> 20:04.740
It was not a tear-jerker. It was very realistically portrayed.

20:05.460 --> 20:09.900
Did you have that ending, I'm curious, in mind when you wrote it?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.380
Or did that just develop and that's how it turned out?

20:13.860 --> 20:20.540
It just developed. That was one of the stories where I didn't know how it was going to come out.

20:21.660 --> 20:24.680
In fact, I worked on that one for two years.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.740
This is not a two-month plot.

20:28.680 --> 20:34.340
I read all the books on the arts in the Stanford Public Library.

20:34.780 --> 20:41.700
This is one year. I took notes on them for my entire two weeks vacation one year.

20:42.740 --> 20:45.860
Then it gradually began to come together.

20:47.540 --> 20:54.600
I used, of course, as you'd seen in the story, Oscar Wilde's story of the nightingale in the rose.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.140
Which I'd read many years before and I was quite impressed by.

21:02.780 --> 21:07.400
The ending, though, I worked on that one.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.880
At one time it had other endings.

21:11.800 --> 21:15.460
But I can't remember what they were. This is the best ending, I think.

21:16.200 --> 21:21.860
Oh, yeah. Again, it had that element of this transcendental experience,

21:22.080 --> 21:26.740
which kind of would, one, to suspect there might be a race of supermen that we're going to be forming.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.500
Well, that was the idea.

21:29.080 --> 21:35.220
With this power that he had, he was then be able to do all kinds of wonderful things.

21:36.360 --> 21:40.900
And it was given to him by a late after the ride up and in.

21:42.520 --> 21:50.940
The British critics, Arthur C. Clarke and Judith Merrill, Michael Morkot, Brian Oldis, really liked the rose.

21:51.820 --> 21:56.860
And yet it seemed that it was another decade or so before it ever caught on over here.

21:56.960 --> 22:03.880
Do you have any pet theories on why in England it was a success, but not one over here particularly at first?

22:03.880 --> 22:08.800
Well, I think this is due to the efforts of Michael Morkot.

22:09.860 --> 22:13.840
He launched it over there and then it was picked up over here.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.260
Let me give you a little bit more history on this.

22:19.220 --> 22:27.440
There was a time when the rose was in a longer form and it had the name not the rose, but invitation.

22:28.780 --> 22:42.960
It was an intergalactic thing where the earth was being examined to see whether it would be admitted into a galactic relevant.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.820
And it didn't have the ending that it now has.

22:48.820 --> 22:54.300
Damon Knight liked that, but he couldn't get his publishers to accept it.

22:54.300 --> 23:06.800
This again was a year or so before it came out and it's inauthentic and it's short form, which tells me.

23:07.800 --> 23:13.640
So at that point I said maybe I'm going to shorten this thing down and give it a different ending.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.360
So I did.

23:16.780 --> 23:21.980
I cut it from 45,000 words down to I think it's about 30,000.

23:24.200 --> 23:31.880
And it, Ackerman then was able to sell it to Arpennick in England.

23:32.660 --> 23:38.360
And then it began to pick up Arthur Clark saw it, Patrick Morkot saw it.

23:39.020 --> 23:43.100
And Morkot was getting into the editorial business over the last, last time.

23:46.780 --> 23:51.080
Asked to have this people, Compact Books, publish it.

23:52.040 --> 23:55.960
And we have a contract for this and they did publish it.

23:56.600 --> 24:03.720
Then it was picked up fairly quickly by two other British outfits in hardcover form.

24:04.860 --> 24:11.380
And of course they had to pad it out with the two other stories to make it in a book size.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.160
And Damon Knight then picked it up from the British.

24:16.880 --> 24:23.060
He said, Hey, here's the thing I've been thinking about all these many years and that's come out in Britain.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.860
Why didn't you give it to me?

24:25.000 --> 24:25.560
So okay.

24:27.980 --> 24:30.580
So Berkeley the right, the US right.

24:33.420 --> 24:36.280
And that's why all the timeline.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.140
It hadn't been for Morkot.

24:39.300 --> 24:42.840
It would never have gone anywhere there or here.

24:43.120 --> 24:48.840
It was interesting though that it was, it appeared in England and then it was 13 years later that it,

24:49.200 --> 24:54.700
that Berkeley finally put it out as a heart as the paperback and that's the only American printing.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.760
It came out, let's see, 1953, I believe in authentic.

24:59.460 --> 25:08.120
Then about another 10 years in pocket book form, a paperback and another couple of years over here.

25:09.220 --> 25:09.360
Yeah.

25:09.440 --> 25:14.300
Well, a prophet is not without honor, save in his own country.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.560
It's not the first to say that.

25:18.260 --> 25:27.300
That's, that's, my theory on it was always that the new wave started in England and maybe they were more attuned to the kind of writing.

25:27.300 --> 25:28.440
Got a point there.

25:28.580 --> 25:31.300
They, they could live with something like this.

25:32.980 --> 25:39.040
Whereas over here, everybody was guided pretty much by the Dean of Science Fiction, John Camel.

25:39.200 --> 25:46.580
And he was a hardware man and everything had to obey the laws of physics or it would be unacceptable.

25:48.040 --> 25:53.000
But I've written many good things for him and I'm grateful to him.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.340
He bought my first story so I can't complain about John Camel.

25:57.560 --> 25:58.340
Great guy.

25:59.580 --> 26:02.840
Now the invitation has never been published as such, right?

26:03.140 --> 26:03.440
Correct.

26:04.580 --> 26:07.780
Good because I couldn't say I'd read everything if it had.

26:09.380 --> 26:11.340
Well, okay.

26:11.460 --> 26:16.760
One or two other little items you haven't read either but they're submerged and not worth dragging you up now.

26:16.760 --> 26:25.100
Well, if you're, I'll get on to them but if you're talking about Leonard Lockhart or whatever, I read them, the two anyway.

26:25.820 --> 26:26.420
Oh well.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.720
That was a collaborative effort, you know.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.380
I guess this would be a good time as any to ask about the Leonard Lockhart stories.

26:33.780 --> 26:35.900
Was it Ted Thomas who was it?

26:35.900 --> 26:36.080
Yeah.

26:36.580 --> 26:36.860
Okay.

26:37.040 --> 26:41.060
Ted and I, we were in the patent department at Sinomid together.

26:41.060 --> 26:46.260
I wrote the first Leonard Lockhart story, improbable profession.

26:47.760 --> 26:58.640
And at that time he was writing science articles for the Stanford Advocate as well as being on the patent, in the patent department at Sinomid.

26:59.340 --> 27:07.300
So I said to him, why don't you and I start this series of stories about a patent attorney and his problems?

27:07.860 --> 27:09.100
Here's the first one.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.800
So he said, yeah, we can do that.

27:12.300 --> 27:15.340
So I wrote the first one, he wrote the second one.

27:15.860 --> 27:17.760
No, together we wrote the second one.

27:17.820 --> 27:18.840
That was half and half.

27:20.540 --> 27:25.700
And after that, I left Sinomid and went to Grace and he continued the series.

27:27.840 --> 27:35.920
So number three is an all subsequent story or it is even though the name Leonard Lockhart is still used on them.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.800
Okay, that'll be a good bridge to the question after this one.

27:41.900 --> 27:48.320
But this question is in 1953 then we saw two short stories, Child Bacronus and the chess players.

27:48.700 --> 27:51.200
And then you disappeared for 13 years.

27:52.060 --> 27:54.780
How did you, what happened?

27:54.940 --> 27:58.760
You wrote for this five years pretty intensively and then Zab you're gone for a while.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.040
How did you decide to do that?

28:01.080 --> 28:16.280
Well, as I mentioned, Bill, my little girl was growing up and at that time I was writing up in the attic of the house I was running and later on one of that box.

28:17.700 --> 28:21.580
And she would stand down in the hallway and cry.

28:21.580 --> 28:26.160
She wanted me to come down and play with her, which I did.

28:26.700 --> 28:37.960
And I put my writing aside and I said, well, first things first, let's bring up this little girl, raise her right, give her some attention.

28:39.560 --> 28:43.140
And if there's time left over to write, I might do some writing.

28:43.700 --> 28:46.160
But there was never any time left over.

28:46.680 --> 28:51.760
And I got out of the habit altogether until she went off to college.

28:52.560 --> 28:57.380
And I thought, gee, I'm going to need some tuition money here, so I better get back with this one.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.140
Which I did.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.000
So it was money again that made you start up?

29:02.380 --> 29:02.640
Yeah.

29:04.940 --> 29:07.720
Okay, when you, I'm sorry, go ahead.

29:08.600 --> 29:13.940
I'm not sure right now whether I'm doing it for money or just to see if I can still do it.

29:16.580 --> 29:22.020
I'm curious as to whether I've lost the touch and maybe this year I will find out.

29:22.600 --> 29:27.820
Anyhow, right now I'm not doing it for money, although the money would be nice.

29:29.660 --> 29:32.620
So there are motives for you. Why do people write?

29:34.460 --> 29:36.120
Go ahead, you had a question.

29:36.120 --> 29:47.560
Okay, in 1966 then, or approximately then, whenever you did start up, all of a sudden we're seeing a different kind of story, the lawyer stories.

29:47.660 --> 29:53.320
And I've got an ornament to his profession and the alchemist, which were kind of related because they were both at the same chemical company.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.420
And then the millionaire patent and probable cause, but they're all law stories.

29:57.420 --> 30:01.820
So I've already asked you why you started writing. That was my first question.

30:02.100 --> 30:07.480
And why did you switch to this kind of story, which was so different from the other stuff except for the Leonard Lockhart stories?

30:07.540 --> 30:13.500
Well, I thought maybe I should use something, and use something of that.

30:14.100 --> 30:19.080
This is my field, my professional field, patent work and law.

30:20.240 --> 30:29.340
And goodness knows there's plenty of drama in it, so I thought maybe I should use some of this local history as background.

30:31.120 --> 30:39.900
And of course that showed up profoundly in the catalyst and later on in the Venetian court.

30:42.700 --> 30:47.740
So it's something I know and I thought I would try it out.

30:50.780 --> 31:00.880
But then you wrote these stories, but then you kept it off with the Ring of Riternal, which was kind of a throwback to the old style.

31:00.880 --> 31:08.520
Well, let me, yeah, okay. That was kind of a throwback. That was an intermediate thing.

31:12.980 --> 31:15.880
I can't explain the anomaly there, Bill.

31:16.920 --> 31:21.840
Well, it was a wonderful anomaly if it was an anomaly. If it wasn't an anomaly, it was a good one.

31:22.080 --> 31:22.880
Well, thank you.

31:23.640 --> 31:30.420
The interesting thing, the mystical part here to me was you had the two different religions vying for each other.

31:30.560 --> 31:38.180
One of them essentially saying that blind chance rules the universe and the other one saying that it's essentially that it's guided by something in it.

31:38.300 --> 31:45.520
It seemed to me that you ended up by kind of siding with the latter that there is something guiding the cosmos.

31:45.520 --> 31:49.540
And that one, that was a really philosophical book.

31:49.780 --> 31:58.320
And the thing there too, the Invasion, the Deep, where was it Homer that stayed there for 18 years in the Deep?

31:58.540 --> 32:09.040
And that, I'd seen evidence of that earlier, this kind of blind space where the protagonist goes and is disembodied and then comes back.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.440
Does that have any special meaning to you or is that out of your subconscious?

32:12.440 --> 32:16.600
It isn't Homer that went into the Deep. He was the brother whose brain was extra.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.200
Okay, right. I'm getting it.

32:18.380 --> 32:19.140
James Andrew.

32:19.300 --> 32:20.920
Yeah, I'm getting it mixed up.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.840
But, okay, I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.860
Oh, no, we might as well get it right here.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.560
Yeah, the Deep, where did that come up?

32:29.940 --> 32:35.080
Because I'd seen evidence for that before in some of the earlier stories from the decade earlier.

32:35.080 --> 32:50.560
I thought that would be a very impressive concept of some all-encompassing milieu, as it were, where only the consciousness can exist.

32:51.720 --> 32:55.020
And this is the use that I put it to.

32:55.900 --> 32:59.160
But beyond that, Bill, I just can't really remember.

32:59.740 --> 33:06.340
The concept of a mind wandering in the Deep does go away way back.

33:06.540 --> 33:10.600
And I had it many years before that. I just didn't have a chance to use it.

33:12.580 --> 33:24.020
Okay, you've done a lot of homework on this novel, too, as far as you used the steady state cosmology theory so that the universe is continually being...

33:24.840 --> 33:27.180
...made up again and being recreated.

33:27.740 --> 33:32.940
Yeah, well, of course, that's one of the standard theories. I think that's gradually yielding now, though.

33:33.100 --> 33:41.820
Right, but it made it interesting. It allows you to have this rebirth, though, which you tend to do, the transcendental rebirth.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.080
And it fit really nicely with steady state cosmology.

33:45.680 --> 33:45.860
Yeah.

33:47.740 --> 33:52.420
But on that very point, I don't know whether you've read Firebird.

33:52.420 --> 33:53.360
Oh, yes.

33:53.800 --> 34:01.340
Now, that one starts out with a big bang and expands and then stops and contracts.

34:02.940 --> 34:11.840
So we have an oscillation, and there are an infinite number of big bangs.

34:12.580 --> 34:20.700
Because when it contracts, it goes back into the original farm hall, and it blows up and expands again.

34:20.700 --> 34:26.380
So that's another theory. That's the apotheosis of the big bang theory.

34:27.320 --> 34:32.460
Yeah, it's the big bang with the closed universe option, where you...

34:32.460 --> 34:34.860
...enough mass to make it oscillate. Yeah.

34:37.380 --> 34:42.040
Okay, you wrote The Ring of Riternal, and then...that was 1968.

34:42.240 --> 34:46.640
Then you disappeared for another six years until the arachnid window came out.

34:46.640 --> 34:49.740
What caused this interlude, if I may ask?

34:50.760 --> 34:55.620
Oh, let me think there. See, did I stop? I can't recall. I must have stopped.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.000
At least you didn't appear in print for six years.

35:01.160 --> 35:09.780
I'm trying to think. Oh, my daughter graduated. She graduated in 1968.

35:11.560 --> 35:17.460
And the heat was off real wrong, and I had to get back on with my son.

35:18.360 --> 35:26.280
He started again in 1972, and it continued for quite a while.

35:27.140 --> 35:33.020
But I just didn't realize there was that gap. Maybe I was just goofing off.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.420
Well, we missed you.

35:37.760 --> 35:43.680
The arachnid window, when you did get back in again, I really enjoyed that story, and it has the time loop.

35:43.900 --> 35:47.460
But I think the thing I enjoyed about that story more than anything was the professor,

35:48.060 --> 35:53.980
who was obviously in the twilight of his career, kind of looking back and wondering if it was all worth it, and that sort of thing.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.980
I liked his point of view.

35:55.980 --> 35:59.820
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

36:03.560 --> 36:11.800
About that time, I realized I was someday soon going to have to retire from grace, so I put myself in it a little bit.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.580
Again, it was a mishmash.

36:19.980 --> 36:34.660
It uses a number of things that were, well, each incident probably has some counterpart and some previous science fiction story.

36:35.540 --> 36:40.140
Time travel, of course, is one of the most tattended things possible.

36:41.500 --> 36:46.060
But time survival, which is what happened here, might be a little different.

36:46.060 --> 36:50.360
And some of the technology there is purely invented.

36:54.680 --> 37:00.400
Okay, all of a sudden, you had four novels that came out, bang, bang, bang, bang.

37:01.100 --> 37:07.380
And Roofhead was the first one, and it was quite different from anything to me anyway than anything you'd written before.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.380
How long had you thought about it? How did it come up?

37:11.380 --> 37:15.380
Oh, I consider that one sort of a pot boiler, Bill.

37:16.400 --> 37:23.280
I started out writing it. I thought I would do a thing which is round upon.

37:23.460 --> 37:27.180
You're not supposed to write post-atomic novels.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.860
They're really unacceptable.

37:32.180 --> 37:34.100
But here seem to be a good one.

37:36.620 --> 37:40.140
And I hope you're not a pro-Nixon fan.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.720
No, not at all.

37:42.540 --> 37:47.500
Well, I thought, gee, here's this guy. He's about to take over the country.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.700
Anything he does is okay just because he says so.

37:52.360 --> 37:56.480
And I'm going to have a character like that in Roofhead.

37:58.980 --> 38:01.840
So I put him in there.

38:01.980 --> 38:09.320
He was the president of the underworld, and he would come out and rule the upper world, except he didn't.

38:10.680 --> 38:19.340
B. Wolk was modeled at the time on an Alaskan Husky dog that lived next door to us.

38:20.320 --> 38:24.920
And she and I were great friends, so I thought I'd put her in it.

38:25.920 --> 38:31.260
And one thing led to another, and it all seemed to come together.

38:32.900 --> 38:36.340
And of course you've got to have telepathy and a thing like that.

38:36.780 --> 38:44.460
There were certain novel aspects of it, the whole like absorbing the energy of the potential earthquake

38:44.460 --> 38:54.820
into a gigantic spinning sphere, and that in turn generating the power to create a vortex in those that have the power.

38:55.540 --> 39:01.400
So there were some novel features, and it's one of my happier efforts.

39:02.380 --> 39:04.080
It's not really serious.

39:06.860 --> 39:08.360
Well, some of it is.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.360
You know, at one time it had a different ending.

39:12.420 --> 39:14.700
And I have to cough when I think about it.

39:14.740 --> 39:15.560
Excuse me while I cough.

39:15.720 --> 39:24.060
This is a psychological cough.

39:27.960 --> 39:38.160
In the original ending, the girl lived, but I got involved in some chemical litigation.

39:39.340 --> 39:41.280
So that's, I lost.

39:43.320 --> 39:48.620
And I was so angry and so disappointed, I said, somebody has to die.

39:49.520 --> 39:57.280
So I killed the heroine and wrote some poetry for her benefit so she wouldn't feel too badly about it.

39:58.040 --> 40:01.400
And that's the poetry of course is in the front and in the back.

40:03.720 --> 40:06.380
So that's a little sidelight on that.

40:08.180 --> 40:09.900
I never would have guessed that.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.280
You thought everything came out logically.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.320
Our personal lives control a lot of what we do.

40:20.660 --> 40:26.320
I've got, what I'd have, I have about five more questions, but I have to flip my tape in a minute.

40:27.100 --> 40:35.940
When I want to, you mentioned the device, the novelty in that, and I meant to mention earlier the device in The Paradox Men or

40:35.940 --> 40:42.700
Flight of the Yeshio, however you want to call it, about the body's shield, which bullets would not appear,

40:42.900 --> 40:45.920
but low momentum projectiles would with the swords.

40:46.060 --> 40:50.400
And I really have always liked that device as a novelty in science fiction.

40:50.400 --> 40:56.280
Well, I needed something like that to get in some sword play.

40:57.080 --> 41:01.700
Why would you want to have sword play when you can just pull out a pistol and shoot a guy in the gut?

41:02.600 --> 41:06.260
Well, the only way you can do it is if a pistol doesn't work.

41:07.080 --> 41:13.260
So then you've got to have something that goes in a little slower and can skewer him properly.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.500
And therefore you will need some kind of shield such as that.

41:18.220 --> 41:20.320
So that's the way I figured it anyhow.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.900
Okay, I'm glad I had remembered to ask that question here.

41:25.320 --> 41:31.780
Tell you, let me change my tape. It'll take about two minutes and I only have about five more questions if you can hang in there.

41:32.040 --> 41:32.700
Yeah, go ahead.

41:32.920 --> 41:38.380
Okay, thank you. If you want to take a break or something, just put the phone down and we'll holler at you.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.460
Put the phone down, get a drink of water and come back and wait for your...

41:41.460 --> 41:42.480
Sounds good. Okay.
