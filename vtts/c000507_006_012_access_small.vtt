00:01.440 --> 00:05.780
Dr. Williams, first of all, we'd like to begin with what you're working on right now.

00:06.380 --> 00:09.400
I'm working on a novel called The Queen of the Legion.

00:09.700 --> 00:16.220
There's another story about the Legion of Space, a series that started back in the early 30s.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.440
Is it going to be serialized like the others?

00:20.520 --> 00:27.120
Well, here's hoping the market started running certain Fred Polo gave me a contract for it a couple of years ago,

00:27.120 --> 00:31.500
and I was president of the science fiction writers of America and involved in other things,

00:31.680 --> 00:39.020
and it has taken time to do, but it's finally falling together, and I'm putting it into my new work process.

00:40.200 --> 00:46.880
I'm pretty enthusiastic about it now. The main character is a girl, and at first I was sort of uncertain

00:46.880 --> 00:54.720
whether I could be convincing in presenting a woman's point of view, but I've sort of fallen in love with Jill by now.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.940
I think I know her pretty well and like her, and I hope the readers do.

00:59.700 --> 01:05.300
Have you finished that trilogy with Fredric Polo, the one on the Dyson Sphere, the three volumes on that?

01:05.440 --> 01:14.780
No, I'm sorry to say we haven't. I finished my part of the second volume some years ago, I think,

01:14.780 --> 01:22.580
and a year and a half ago, Judy Lynn Del Ray gave us a revised contract with a larger advance,

01:23.080 --> 01:29.820
and her idea then was to publish all three proposed volumes in one thick volume,

01:30.080 --> 01:37.920
and Fred was going to get it out last March at that time, but that's the last I've heard about it.

01:39.420 --> 01:48.080
He's promoting this work, he's involved in many projects, and that's always been the history of working with him.

01:48.080 --> 01:54.200
He's a great collaborator, but he takes his time, so I have hope that he'll eventually get back to it.

01:54.740 --> 02:00.140
Have you recently been redoing some of the humanoid material too, correct? Have you finished?

02:00.780 --> 02:02.020
Is there a novel that's come out of that?

02:02.020 --> 02:07.980
Yes, and you know I've called the humanoid touch that I finished all over a year ago,

02:08.200 --> 02:13.440
and it will be published, I think, this summer in a limited-signed edition from Fantasia Press,

02:13.780 --> 02:17.480
and with a whole round hard cover this November.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.580
Part of that was serialized in analog, wasn't it?

02:21.520 --> 02:22.720
The humanoid reprinted or printed...

02:22.720 --> 02:24.000
The humanoid universe, I believe?

02:24.140 --> 02:26.320
...in the middle of it under the title of the humanoid universe.

02:27.560 --> 02:32.380
There was a reference in that story or somewhere to a book called Ten Trillion Wise Machines. What's that?

02:32.600 --> 02:40.100
Well, that was my second title. At first I was going to call the novel a humanoid universe, and Fred didn't like that,

02:40.580 --> 02:46.460
and I wanted to call it Ten Trillion Wise Machines, which is a title I like,

02:46.880 --> 02:54.600
but people wanted the name humanoid in the title, and also that's pretty long to go on a book jacket.

02:55.160 --> 03:01.260
J.K. Klein, a science fiction photographer, is a man who came up with the title of humanoid touch,

03:01.960 --> 03:07.260
which I think was appropriate and brief, and has humanoids in it, and I'm very happy with it.

03:08.240 --> 03:12.260
Perhaps you could explain the difference between humanoids and androids and robots.

03:12.260 --> 03:24.640
Well, in my mind, the robots are a mechanical man, and the humanids are a type of robot.

03:24.880 --> 03:31.440
That is, they're made out of plastic and steel and operated by remote control, by computers and so forth.

03:32.180 --> 03:41.520
And androdes, because I used the term in the connetaires many years ago, and I think it's generally used as a meat machine.

03:41.520 --> 03:50.560
A synthetic or artificial human being made out of flesh and blood, the sort of thing that is possible to produce these days

03:50.560 --> 03:53.960
in the near future by genetic engineering, let's say.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.580
That is, androids bleed in humanoid's grease.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.040
It's interesting that you're going back and doing some of the material you started with,

04:06.040 --> 04:09.820
well not started with, but what you've done before, you know, the legion material, humanoids and so forth.

04:09.820 --> 04:13.200
Was it 1928 you published, you began publishing?

04:13.300 --> 04:19.120
The first story was published in November, December 1928.

04:19.120 --> 04:23.300
That's your amazing. And I've been a science fiction writer ever since.

04:23.440 --> 04:28.440
That was in the tradition of merit, wasn't it more of a fantasy kind of?

04:28.840 --> 04:32.200
Yes, pretty much at that time I was infatuated with merit.

04:32.980 --> 04:37.080
I haven't read ready for many years lest the spell be gone.

04:37.080 --> 04:47.520
But the first stories I wrote were full of these attempts at purple color illustrated with too many adjectives.

04:48.560 --> 04:55.580
Later I began to try for more convincing settings and stronger characters and fewer adjectives.

04:56.220 --> 04:57.600
Well, may I just start writing?

04:58.300 --> 05:05.380
Well, I grew up on a sand hill farm in the south part of this county when times were pretty grim.

05:08.180 --> 05:16.240
Well, I wanted to be some sort of scientist without any direction or means to get a scientific education.

05:16.720 --> 05:23.720
A few months after Grungeback started the Old Amazing, I came across some copies of it.

05:24.160 --> 05:33.140
And I was immediately fascinated with experiments that worked with traveling time and spaceships to other worlds.

05:34.180 --> 05:40.280
All sorts of wonderful things. It's been an important share of my life ever since.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.520
Did you start for the money? Was it money and bone?

05:44.560 --> 05:47.620
Well, the money was well almost in material.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.780
I got $25 for that first story eventually.

05:53.320 --> 06:01.180
And after a couple of years I earned enough writing science fiction so I didn't have to do anything else.

06:01.180 --> 06:07.520
But half the secret was that I wasn't married and was willing to live economically.

06:08.260 --> 06:11.400
So I certainly didn't do it for the money.

06:12.400 --> 06:19.220
After two years in college I was offered a student assistantship in the chemistry lab.

06:19.660 --> 06:26.300
I could have had a different career as a chemist probably when I was more fascinated with science fiction

06:26.300 --> 06:29.460
than I was with solid science by that time.

06:29.580 --> 06:34.420
Though I have tried to keep up as best a language can with what's going on in science.

06:35.480 --> 06:41.840
Was the account true that I read in one place where you didn't know that your story had been accepted until you saw the magazine on the press?

06:41.920 --> 06:49.520
That's true. I wrote these stories on an old Remington Biscuit model typewriter and a purple ribbon.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.020
Two or three of them came back. One of them was with a misspelled write in the title.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.460
And the metal man never did come back.

06:56.960 --> 07:05.320
I was over at Canyon, Texas walking by near Stan one day and I saw my metal man on the cover of Amazing.

07:06.780 --> 07:08.640
It was quite a thrill.

07:10.160 --> 07:17.380
What was it like to write for the pulp say through the 30s and so forth?

07:17.380 --> 07:21.500
Did you feel a part of something? Did you feel isolated out here?

07:21.720 --> 07:25.400
There weren't many around here who could share your interest or was there?

07:25.940 --> 07:37.860
The science fiction world has always been a sort of special community where I suppose we had our own special hand on science and the future and the shape of things to come.

07:39.080 --> 07:48.680
I didn't see how the science fiction people very often read their stories and read letters in magazines and so forth.

07:50.600 --> 08:00.980
In those days, before the paperbacks and before TV and before the comics, people read a lot more for entertainment than they do nowadays.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.920
And there were really three sorts of magazines.

08:04.400 --> 08:18.620
There were quality magazines like Hot Birds and the old Scribner's, and Light It for People with Brains and the Slicks, printed on coated paper that would take good advertising for people with money to spend.

08:19.120 --> 08:26.320
The pulps for people who had neither brains nor money, but we had a lot of fun in the pulps even.

08:26.320 --> 08:38.640
We were looked down upon widely and eventually by science fiction got recognized as being not entirely without brains, let's say.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.340
And nowadays there's a little bit of money in it sometimes.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.280
Back then it wasn't call science fiction, was it?

08:45.760 --> 08:49.820
No, when I started, my first story was printed as science fiction.

08:49.820 --> 08:53.600
Hugo Gernsback wrote science fiction together.

08:54.260 --> 08:58.600
He invited the term science fiction in 2009, I think.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.440
At that time you had to explain what it was.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.500
I used to say it was the bunch of stories with the science background.

09:06.100 --> 09:11.360
Well, wasn't Gernsback, didn't he want more scientifically oriented stories?

09:12.290 --> 09:20.080
He preached gospel that science fiction was sugar coated science, that it was education.

09:21.200 --> 09:32.380
And he got a whole panel of experts with degrees that were supposed to vet the science and science wonder stories when he started that.

09:32.380 --> 09:47.460
But actually I think that was as much from the middle to impress the readers as anything else because he did use true science in his stories when he could get it.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.340
But he also printed a lot of stories that were pretty wild.

09:51.820 --> 09:56.960
I think always in the magazine the adventure was more important than the science.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.340
I've only seen a few copies of those very early pulps.

10:01.340 --> 10:04.300
They say the amazing stories. That's a pretty big size.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.580
Well, the size that time is nowadays.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.740
Were there other sizes too or types?

10:11.480 --> 10:15.780
Amazing was that size and wonder stories from Gernsback started that.

10:15.780 --> 10:26.960
But they were also, and they were hardly regular pulps because in the beginning they were amazing.

10:27.200 --> 10:34.440
It was filled up with reprints of classic science fiction and the rights were so low that professional writers didn't write for them.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.740
So in the book, new stories, they were mostly written by amateurs such as myself.

10:38.740 --> 10:49.420
But the pulp magazines were published in chains with, well, sometimes quite a different magazines.

10:49.700 --> 10:58.420
There were mass economists there because they could print the covers all in the same press run and so forth.

10:58.420 --> 11:01.120
And they had a standard smaller size.

11:02.860 --> 11:05.580
A stounding came along from Clayton.

11:05.640 --> 11:10.840
First is Stounding Stories of Super Science. It was the pulp size.

11:11.540 --> 11:14.540
What was the average rate for stories in those days?

11:14.740 --> 11:25.380
Well, Gernsback paid a half a cent a word or less, which meant we'd get $25 for a short story and $75 for a novelette.

11:25.380 --> 11:35.640
But Clayton paid two cents a word and up, which is one reason maybe the Clayton magazines went bankrupt in the Great Depression.

11:36.460 --> 11:50.740
But that meant that I could pound up 4,000 words a day for two days and earn 160 bucks, which was a fabulous feat for a farm kid in depression days.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.940
That was a pretty good income back then.

11:52.940 --> 11:54.580
It was. There was a lot of money.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.820
Did you get much reader response? Did fans or readers ever...?

11:58.820 --> 12:04.480
Well, of course, I didn't know many people in the locality who read science fiction.

12:04.940 --> 12:11.840
But in those days, the backs of the magazines were filled up with letters and tiny types from readers.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.760
That was the principle reader response.

12:15.680 --> 12:19.600
I think the editors favored them because they didn't have to pay for the letters.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.820
They were interesting to us.

12:25.860 --> 12:28.160
I used to write them myself as well as reading.

12:29.020 --> 12:31.040
It was the beginning of a fan, I suppose.

12:35.340 --> 12:48.240
From what I can gather, reading back on your publishing history and so forth, through the 30s, late 20s, early 30s, you were mostly writing, I guess I would call it space opera, the legion material.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.700
I've never objected to space opera. I still think it's wonderful.

12:52.180 --> 12:58.820
I even think that Star Wars could have been made out of my legion stories as well as it was from something else.

12:58.820 --> 13:04.680
I enjoyed Star Wars tremendously as a lesson day dream.

13:05.480 --> 13:12.180
Well, the pop readers were mostly young and as naive as I was.

13:13.180 --> 13:19.140
The space opera was a symbolic escape from all sorts of things.

13:21.600 --> 13:31.380
I notice, I'm not sure how I would phrase this, a change or a deepening or a more serious aspect to your fiction that begins in the late 30s.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.940
Would I be right in saying that?

13:33.120 --> 13:37.760
Probably. I was growing up and the readers were growing up.

13:37.760 --> 13:43.940
That's something that's been going on in science fiction, at least in American science fiction all along.

13:44.040 --> 14:02.080
I think you can draw a distinction between, let's say, European or mainstream science fiction on the one hand, which has always been recognized and treated as literature and part of American science fiction, which was looked down on.

14:02.080 --> 14:13.460
But as the readers of that grew older, some of them started writing, some of them started editing magazines, most of them outbrew science fiction, but some of them didn't.

14:13.620 --> 14:23.540
So there was a continual increase in the education, the sophistication and so forth, the whole field.

14:23.540 --> 14:32.320
Maybe you should call it a diversification because there's still a readership for Edgar Rassabura and Robert E. Howard and whatever.

14:33.540 --> 14:51.220
There are also people who, as I said, former fans who are now academic fans who are teaching science fiction courses and writing scholarly articles on science fiction to meet the publisher Paris test and so forth.

14:51.220 --> 15:00.680
So essentially the field is just diversified into all sorts of levels and areas and interests.

15:01.420 --> 15:05.080
Did Campbell influence the way he wrote fiction at all? Don W. Campbell?

15:05.080 --> 15:26.120
Yes, I think he influenced the way that everybody wrote science fiction because when he became editor of Amazing and later changed the, I mean, Astounding, later changed the name to Analogue, he had the best high-spay market in the field.

15:26.120 --> 15:38.200
He was, well, let's say, science fiction was serious to him as a way of speculating about science and its impact in the future of mankind and so forth.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.420
He was tremendously inventive.

15:41.440 --> 15:54.180
He was full of ideas that he shared very freely and everybody who was writing science fiction for those years was influenced by Kamala, it seems to me,

15:54.180 --> 16:10.000
whether directly or not, if they weren't trying to write for him and reading his letters, they were reading such writers as O. Heinlein and Dick Kemp and Sturgeon and the dozen others who were Kamala writers.

16:10.000 --> 16:18.940
And some people resetted Kamala and felt that it was an effort to write for him.

16:19.160 --> 16:32.860
Kamala and Heinlein used to complain that you couldn't sell him adult sex, but Kamala and I thought so much alike so that I always felt at home with his magazine and enjoyed working with him.

16:32.860 --> 16:48.660
And he gave me occasional very useful suggestions that I used and he never did, well, I didn't have material, I had to try to persuade me to say anything I didn't want to say.

16:48.660 --> 17:03.220
But I believe that personally he was optimistic about science in the future, but when I wrote such a pessimistic, dystopian thing as The Folded Hands, he published it as it was and asked for more.

17:03.840 --> 17:07.900
He was going to ask you about that with folded hands. You sold that one to Campbell, that was sold to him?

17:07.900 --> 17:19.920
And he suggested a sequel to it. He was fanatic for various things that look sort of correct, but nowadays including Joseph Ryan and parapsychology.

17:20.500 --> 17:30.460
And he suggested that people's hands were folded, they would use their minds, they would develop parapsychological powers and perhaps defeat the humanoids.

17:30.460 --> 17:44.500
I felt that the humanoids couldn't be defeated so that the ending of my novel was sort of ambiguous, but he published it as I said it to him and the reader seems like it's probably not.

17:44.960 --> 17:52.320
I was interested in what you wrote in the afterward to one of the recent editions of The Humanoids, the way your interpretation of it's changed.

17:52.620 --> 17:58.540
Like, didn't she used to see yourself, you said, as a romantic and the humanoids were bad, but then you'd altered that?

17:58.540 --> 18:21.300
Well, I think so. That is, at one level, since the human knowledge of machines, the perfect machine, as originally stated, the theme, the perfect machine would be perfectly dreadful because it would take away all human freedom and responsibility and opportunity for achievement.

18:22.120 --> 18:34.680
But as I came to look at the story of Maher, it seemed to me the essential human conflict in it is the conflict between the individual and society.

18:35.680 --> 18:55.940
The people in the stories are in a complex and painful emotional situation because the humanoids are meant to be good. They're presented as benign, they're trying to assure the safety and happiness of mankind.

18:56.740 --> 19:16.100
And in doing this they destroy freedom and I decided eventually this reflects my own very other childhood experience when people were overprotecting me because they loved me and my own good, but still I couldn't help a deeper sentiment because they wouldn't let me do some many things I wanted to do.

19:16.100 --> 19:42.620
And I feel, by the way, that the conflict between the individual and society is the basic material of most literature, really, and I approach it in all sorts of ways.

19:43.580 --> 20:04.760
And another level why it can be critical of the influence of society on the individual is, and Ibsen especially, he presents character after character, who's destroyed by the pressures of society or by conceiving too much to society.

20:05.760 --> 20:20.380
In that novel, the humanoids of Iron Smith, it seemed to me, represented society or conformity and so forth. When I first read the book I kept thinking he was going to turn into an evil character of villain, but you never made him a villain.

20:20.580 --> 20:30.660
He remained, I don't know, a friendly person, a helpful person, but simply one who was siding with the humanoids. Has your attitude toward him changed since you've written the book?

20:30.660 --> 20:39.400
I don't think maybe I understand him better. When I was writing the novel I don't think I really understood him except that he was a fascinating enigma.

20:39.740 --> 20:54.360
That is, he was a likable guy, he wasn't caught up in the conflict that my main character was. He got along with the humanoids and they befriended him.

20:54.360 --> 21:22.180
And it occurred to me later that he's the example of the person who does conform to society, who accepts its limitations, and as a result of that, he's unable to live a more relaxed and richer life in contrast to the person always in conflict with society, who in the worst instance has to destroy himself because nobody can live alone.

21:23.040 --> 21:36.180
If you were to continue with the humanoid, you know, further than you have the humanoid stories, would you ultimately have them, man, being happy under their care? Would they stop conquering the universe?

21:36.180 --> 21:50.640
Well, I haven't planned to do that. In fact, I was reluctant to write any more about him until Fred Poll offered me a contract that I couldn't refuse.

21:50.640 --> 22:09.740
But in this new novel, the humanoid touch, where I tried to work out an alternative that doesn't involve the destruction of the humanoids but does offer an alternate way of life that isn't escaped from.

22:10.840 --> 22:19.360
I don't know how readers will react at the story. I enjoyed writing and I have hopes for it.

22:19.360 --> 22:32.740
Well, you must have, when you finished the humanoids, it was with folded hands, say when you finished with folded hands in that time period, you must have gotten some response from readers or editors that it was kind of pessimistic or dystopian because you wrote the equalizer, didn't you, as sort of a counter?

22:32.740 --> 22:57.760
Well, more or less, in fact, with folded hands, the humanoid stories were the first project that I undertook after I got home from World War II. I was an Air Force weather forecaster in the Southwest Pacific when the bomb went off and the atomic bomb cast a dark mushroom cloud over all science fiction.

22:58.620 --> 23:10.220
And much science fiction was suddenly pessimistic about the future and this was the setting in which I wrote the humanoid.

23:10.660 --> 23:18.060
And when I started to write it, I originally felt that they could be somehow conquered or disposed of or whatever.

23:18.060 --> 23:24.520
Then as a work-film, I realized that logically and artistically, they were invincible.

23:24.520 --> 23:43.520
So I gave up in the middle of a, before I got to the middle of a novel I planned and wrote the equalizer as an example of, let's say, that technology is benevolent.

23:43.520 --> 23:53.520
It can be used to make a really better world. Then I came back with the humanoid and re-plotted it with folded hands.

23:54.380 --> 24:09.700
I would just have one more question on the humanoid books, the humanoid material. I guess some of the readers, some responses I've read about it have been kind of confused or on both sides of the question as to what you meant.

24:09.700 --> 24:23.180
My concern would be, are you optimistic about man and his future and his relation to machines? Can he control them? Can he survive them? Are they going to destroy him in his nature?

24:23.180 --> 24:39.680
Well, I think I'm optimistic. I try to be optimistic. I think that once we have technology, we can't unhave it. We can't put the genie back in the bottle. We have to accept it and live with it.

24:39.680 --> 24:56.760
I think that people who want to return to the 18th century or to the Garden of Eden or whatever are simply trying to whistle in the dark. And I think that technology can solve problems if we use it to solve problems.

24:56.760 --> 25:26.680
So I'm more optimistic than stories. I think that to a considerable extent, a story should have its own independent theme, more or less independently of what the writer thinks or believes when I'm trying to write a story where I like to stop after I have a reasonable start and look at it and decide what the theme is and then rearrange it if necessary.

25:26.760 --> 25:30.500
I think that's the best way to give it the strongest impact I can.

25:33.540 --> 25:35.520
Do you have any questions in this area, David?

25:35.720 --> 25:48.740
Not about the humanoids. I have one backing up a little bit. It seems that many of your stories have anticipated scientific discoveries such as Dark Star Station anticipated neutron stars. How did you get the ideas about that?

25:48.740 --> 26:12.840
Well, it's hard to say except that I've always been fascinated with science. What you can put it as a sort of mystery story of what the world is, the universe is about its origins and development and meaning with effort going on in a hundred fields of science to unravel the mystery.

26:13.580 --> 26:36.100
I've always tried to read science magazines and science books and keep up with what's happening. I'm concerned with what the universe is. Sometimes I have speculations of my own that will later confirm this.

26:40.420 --> 26:49.760
I notice a number of stories and in some of your novels, especially in the late 30s or 40s where you describe totalitarian kind of societies like Breakdown.

26:51.260 --> 26:54.060
Was that the story I think with the Square Deal, if I remember correctly?

26:54.580 --> 27:03.020
In that area where the humans are struggling to overcome a sort of a totalitarian society, was that in any way related to the world situation?

27:03.020 --> 27:23.500
I think so. At that time, of course, we were faced with Hitler a little bit later with Stalin. I think there were too many stories of that time that placed us in a struggle with a totalitarian situation.

27:23.500 --> 27:43.440
And of course, that is the sort of ultimate statement of the problem of the society versus the individual, the individual being destroyed, at least his freedom erased by a totally arbitrary society.

27:44.280 --> 27:58.840
If I'm remembering correctly that story Breakdown, that the one where Boss Kellan was in control and his son wanted to go to the stars, right? The research, the interest, and the boss had stayed on the earth, forget that.

27:58.840 --> 28:11.900
I took that as very characteristic of your fiction that you have to have a goal, a challenge, you have to keep wanting to go rather than be structured and restricted in a society.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.860
You know, kind of something to look forward to to try for.

28:14.860 --> 28:38.880
I think we all need goals and promises and escapes and freedom and realization of possibility and so forth. It seems to me that where we're caught in this paradoxical situation between the needs of the individual and the demands of the society, and we can't live completely alone.

28:38.880 --> 28:58.860
One week we have to have the support and not have one-to-four of the other people, but the society demands too much. It's destructive. So there's no final answer to it. It's a matter of precarious set of compromises that goes on as long as we live.

28:58.860 --> 29:27.160
And some people make compromises more successful than others. I did my dissertation on H.G. Wells, I think was a very successful compromise with society, and lived a very rich and varied life, and ensured the love of many gifted women and so on and so forth, and contrasted with a friend of his named Gissie, George Gissie, my mid-hoof.

29:27.160 --> 29:34.760
I think that's the first time I've ever seen a woman who, well, met society or tried to head on and died young and bitter and poor and defeated.

29:35.600 --> 29:44.720
Yeah, didn't you sort of, if I remember one place you sort of care, you didn't say this, but I got the impression Gissie was the, say, the forester type in the humanoids, and Wells was more the iron smith type?

29:45.180 --> 29:48.440
Well, that fits my own notions. I don't know if I ever said it.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.380
Did you take Wells to be pessimistic or about man's future progress?

29:53.380 --> 29:59.380
Well, I did my dissertation on Wells and tied on critical progress.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.300
Critical progress?

30:09.300 --> 30:29.960
Well, I think that our universe is not all we'd like it to be, that our universe is hostile or certainly not friendly to progress, and that we have a barrier in the animal nature of mankind, which he explores and presents things as the island of Dr. Morrow,

30:29.960 --> 30:49.620
and then a further notion that progress limits itself, that is, as an evolutionary struggle, and I think that Wells was a Darwinian if you stop struggling and you sink back, so you never can reach an ultimate peak and stay there.

30:49.620 --> 31:13.340
But on the other hand, Wells must have had hope for something about Earth because he spent most of his life in a struggle to build a better society, to educate us and warn us and shape us for a world of state, and he died, I think, more or less in bitter despair,

31:13.340 --> 31:20.060
but still it seems to be that not most of his life was lived in hope.

31:24.280 --> 31:32.760
I want to ask you a little bit too. It's fascinating to me the way science fiction caught on and began, you know, through the 30s and so forth.

31:32.760 --> 31:41.240
And all around 1939, if I remember, people like Asimov and Heinlein, and I think it's pronounced Van Bo, is that correct?

31:42.020 --> 31:47.760
Van Bo, okay. They started publishing around that time. Were you reading these people as they started?

31:47.760 --> 32:12.920
They all started in Kamal's magazine, astounding. He was, well, I don't know whether you'd say Kamal discovered them or they discovered him, but it was, let's say, a small group with a great deal of well-fellowship or fellow understanding and so forth.

32:12.920 --> 32:32.760
And it was an exciting period in which to be alive. In 1940, I spent about a year in Los Angeles when I spent many Saturday evenings up at Bob Hanlon's home on Laurel Canyon in Hollywood.

32:32.760 --> 32:44.780
When we had what we called the Manana Literary Society, it was not an organization, it was just a group of friends, but we got together and talked science fiction.

32:45.140 --> 32:56.820
And we were all reading each other science fiction, but it was published. The field was a lot closer knit than it is now because everybody could read all that anybody published.

32:56.820 --> 33:03.900
It was a little group and we were much closer together, and by and large, we were friends.

33:05.160 --> 33:14.140
Have you kept up personal, well, I guess as president, AFWA and so forth, or SWA?

33:15.600 --> 33:16.940
SFWA, that's right.

33:16.940 --> 33:27.880
Well, I still have a lot of old friendships and make new friends, but we have upwards of 500 members in the organization.

33:29.460 --> 33:34.080
Nearly all of them have published at least a few stories.

33:34.080 --> 33:44.760
And publishers, paperback publishers, some make probably 20 or 30 free books a month.

33:45.020 --> 34:03.300
And most of these I don't have time to read. So I have old friends that I try to keep in touch with, keep up with, but it's impossible for anybody to be as intimately acquainted with all the field as we all were in the 30s and 40s.

34:04.080 --> 34:20.820
But we still have a fellowship or sort of subculture that draws us together in a way that doesn't happen to leaders of the mystery or westerns or whatever.

34:20.820 --> 34:32.660
And it seems to me that basically it's a concern with science and technology and impact on human beings and technology and the future that we have.

34:34.140 --> 34:47.900
Not a realization that the world is changing and a concern about what the future is going to be like, that the layman or the mundane, as people call them, try to forget maybe,

34:47.900 --> 34:51.760
because if they see change at all they're afraid of it.

34:52.160 --> 34:59.960
Yeah, I read that when you were younger you were sort of anti-nuclear power and your position on that's changed over the years.

35:00.600 --> 35:15.320
Well, I'm certainly pro-nuclear power now. I'm not sure that I was ever strongly against it except that when I heard that the atom had been split,

35:15.320 --> 35:31.280
when I was sort of dismayed, I had known that it was possible I'd written fiction about it as early as 1930, but I saw that it was going to make life complicated and I wish that it hadn't happened in my time.

35:31.280 --> 35:41.360
But now since we have nuclear power it seems to me it's the safest and most necessary development that I can see.

35:41.820 --> 35:46.760
You talk about contrasting mind, coal and nuclear power.

35:47.100 --> 35:52.500
When you mind coal you bring out a lot of uranium and thorium along with it.

35:52.600 --> 35:58.880
When you burn it, you pollute the atmosphere with a lot more radiation than has ever escaped from a nuclear plant.

35:58.880 --> 36:11.040
You kill people in the mines and on the railways and so on and so forth, so that nobody, to the best of my knowledge, has yet been killed in a commercial nuclear accident.

36:12.040 --> 36:21.700
And when we were developing steam boat boats on the Mississippi where we blew up people every few days and nobody talked much about it.

36:21.700 --> 36:37.280
So it seems to me we have a sort of exaggerated fear of nuclear hazards and an unwillingness to open our eyes and balance the realities.

36:38.280 --> 36:54.620
We can produce and use nuclear energy nowadays and whatever else we do is going to be more expensive or more dangerous or delayed.

36:54.620 --> 37:06.900
That is space power plants, solar power, whatever, all for glittering possibilities for the next century but they can't do much for us in the next 10 or 20 or 30 years.

37:08.460 --> 37:12.780
I'll change the subject for just a minute. How did you start to collaborate with Frederick Paul?

37:12.780 --> 37:24.640
Well, at that time Fred was my agent and I sent him material and he suggested things that could be done with it.

37:24.980 --> 37:29.360
The first instance was something that I called the Conquest of the Abyss.

37:29.360 --> 37:37.300
I started out to write a novel about an undersea world and I put in the bedsheet on the wall and made maps.

37:37.560 --> 37:43.860
I did research, I described the technologies and invented people and culture and the setup.

37:44.520 --> 37:48.620
When I got about halfway through what was meant to be the novel, it just died.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.680
I used up all my creativity and planning.

37:52.480 --> 38:02.120
When Fred came in, we got three undersea novels about it and our reefs of space came about more or less the same way.

38:03.060 --> 38:15.420
Somewhat later, I'd written a 400 page draft of something called the Iron Collar Man that had the reefs of space and all the essential background in it.

38:15.420 --> 38:24.160
I was happy with it. I never did do a final draft and I showed it to Fred while we repotted it and he rewrote it.

38:25.100 --> 38:36.920
It was a very successful revision, speaking of anticipating science, where it took a long time to get that into print.

38:36.920 --> 38:47.280
I was afraid that people wouldn't start doing organ transplants too soon, but we did read the heart transcratters at least by a few years.

38:47.820 --> 38:51.020
You're speaking of the body bank in that one.

38:51.120 --> 39:04.440
That was a lot of fun to do and I had the body bank in my version, but Fred came up with a lot of delightfully horrifying variations and possibilities of the body bank.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.260
Had you run across that in fiction before?

39:06.400 --> 39:08.520
To your knowledge, was that the first time people had done it?

39:08.520 --> 39:14.400
Well, so far as I knew it was near the body bank, it was suddenly a new phrase to me.

39:16.980 --> 39:25.600
I'm still curious. I've never understood how someone can collaborate on a novel. How does that work in your relationship?

39:25.600 --> 39:35.940
First of all, a collaboration is a pretty intimate relationship, so like a marriage, it doesn't work unless you have a mutual trust.

39:36.320 --> 39:41.860
Preferably both parties should have complementary abilities, so each one can have something.

39:42.540 --> 39:48.640
I've collaborated with several people and always because I felt that they could do something I couldn't.

39:48.640 --> 39:52.460
The first collaboration was with Dr. Miles J. Brewer.

39:53.460 --> 40:02.080
Some 50 years ago we wrote a novel together as well as a short story and a novel that I just re-read.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.340
In some ways I thought it was pretty good.

40:04.760 --> 40:12.420
I kind of apprenticed myself to Brewer who was selling to Amazing a couple of years ahead of me.

40:12.420 --> 40:24.340
When you look at him now, he wasn't a really brilliant writer, but he was competent and serious and took his techniques seriously.

40:25.260 --> 40:36.240
He knew things that I wanted to learn. I did the writing and most of the writing and he helped with the plotting and suggested revisions and whatever.

40:37.240 --> 40:52.400
With Fred, I respect him and first of all I like him and then I respect his style, his editorial sense and his craftsmanship generally.

40:55.220 --> 41:03.320
When I'm working with someone like Fred, I think a writer needs an audience.

41:03.320 --> 41:10.320
That is communication is a two-way process. You need to know your audience and you need feedback from your audience.

41:10.320 --> 41:13.960
I'm doing a first drive for someone like Fred.

41:14.400 --> 41:23.500
Since I know him, it gives an automatic focus. It helps crystallize the point of view.

41:23.900 --> 41:32.180
It makes the writing go a lot faster, especially since I know that he's going to do the final drive.

41:32.180 --> 41:43.420
I don't have to worry about literary polish, the alliterations or avoiding rhyming words, or whatever I write down what comes.

41:43.880 --> 41:47.140
Trust him to redo it.

41:47.780 --> 41:55.020
In other words, in your relationship with him, you sort of get the ideas in the first draft and he does the revision and polishing.

41:57.880 --> 42:01.520
That was a trilogy. You mentioned the Reefs of Space. That was a trilogy, if I recall.

42:01.660 --> 42:02.860
The third book was Rogue Star.

42:06.720 --> 42:10.840
One of the ideas that fascinated me in that book, I think it was also in the second book, Star Child.

42:11.440 --> 42:17.020
The concept of a sentient star and combining that with the intelligence with a human intelligence.

42:17.020 --> 42:21.500
That was an idea that appealed to me tremendously.

42:23.280 --> 42:35.740
I'm not sure where I got it. Sturgeon wrote a story long ago called Kill Dojo about a sentient thing that seized a world of Dojo.

42:35.740 --> 42:56.960
My original motion for the story was to begin with the creation of a mind that could possess matter, could store intelligence, I think, and shifting electronic spin or whatever I had to technique.

42:56.960 --> 43:11.680
I wanted to tell the story completely from the viewpoint of the creature that was made in the laboratory and enlarged itself successively until it became the mind of a star.

43:11.680 --> 43:20.580
I did the first draft of the story that way, but Fred didn't like it, felt that it was successful.

43:21.580 --> 43:33.840
He had me do some more material from the viewpoints of the human characters and the stories that published, had shifting points of view.

43:35.320 --> 43:54.360
That's one collaboration that I've always a little bit regretted because I felt that the way I wanted to do it from the viewpoint of the alien could have been done and would have been something more original and difficult, or maybe harder to do.

43:55.820 --> 44:07.540
But it worked out very well as a collaboration and evidently there was something less than successful about my first draft of Fred Buttenham Odie to change it.

44:08.780 --> 44:10.440
Do you have any questions right now, Deire?

44:10.640 --> 44:12.600
No, I'm fascinated so far.

44:16.120 --> 44:25.060
Every once in a while I see portions of your stories, your novels that are being serialized in books like Galaxy or Amazing or Analog and so forth.

44:25.660 --> 44:31.160
And there's one I've read partially, but I haven't found the rest of it. The one on Black Lantern and Snow Fire.

44:32.680 --> 44:36.840
That was published as the power of blackness.

44:37.820 --> 44:45.120
It was three or five novel that's put together, three of them right in the magazine, the Fight of Sin Science fiction.

44:47.280 --> 44:50.100
And I guess one in Galaxy and one in Amazing.

44:50.860 --> 44:58.120
One thing I saw, it seemed to me especially as a teacher of English, I guess, I look for symbolism in some places.

44:58.120 --> 45:07.040
Is it Black Lantern seemed to me to represent say the third world, the oppressed, the Africans, the Latin Americans, a black man from the streets?

45:07.380 --> 45:26.060
I think so. My original notion in the story was to write a thought, a sort of thought experiment to set up a story situation that would be attached to primitivism versus progress.

45:26.060 --> 45:35.260
You know the theme of primitivism is something that we as teachers of literature, delight to discover William Faulkner or whatever.

45:36.020 --> 45:51.620
And what I did in the story was to set up the planet Gunga, which was settled many thousand years ago by refugees from a wrecked spaceship who fell back into savagery on a hard world.

45:51.620 --> 45:55.520
So they developed a very primitive society.

45:56.200 --> 46:15.420
Meanwhile the galactic civilization continued to evolve so that Gunga's rediscovered why we have, let's say, an ultimately sophisticated technology in contrast with more or less ultimate primitivism.

46:15.420 --> 46:26.260
And Black Lantern is a presented, is a member of the primitive society and conflict with the other society.

46:26.700 --> 46:34.620
At that time I was still teaching school so I did the thing as a series of novelists so I just were getting it written and published.

46:35.060 --> 46:43.600
And it probably lacks unity and I feel myself at the middle section of it's probably better than the two concluding sections.

46:44.260 --> 46:52.840
Did you mean for one of the characters in that story, I think his name was Tool Smith, did you mean for him to be the same as Iron Smith because he does speak for the computer, the machine?

46:53.480 --> 46:54.360
One more or less.

46:55.380 --> 46:59.540
I wonder, especially the similarity of name and the way they thought.

47:00.580 --> 47:05.800
But he started to start to represent it over there, technological culture.

47:06.320 --> 47:11.020
Would snowfire have any, I guess I want to say symbolic value, although that's not quite the word.

47:12.420 --> 47:29.840
Well, I'm only a romance, I love interest and she appealed to me as a sophisticated, civilized person in contact with a savage on his way up.

47:30.400 --> 47:33.420
And I thought that there would be electricity between them.

47:33.420 --> 47:37.680
The name probably is not too successful.

47:38.380 --> 47:43.380
I thought it was sort of striking and appealing at the time, but people have sneered at it.

47:43.580 --> 47:46.960
You didn't mean for black and snow, black lanterns, no fire to us?

47:47.080 --> 47:51.660
Well, I don't know, that's part of it, but it's maybe too obvious.
