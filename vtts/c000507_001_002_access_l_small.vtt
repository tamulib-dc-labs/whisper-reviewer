00:03.420 --> 00:09.200
The introduction that you just heard is courtesy of Lee Edmunds, his portable synthesiser.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.100
And David Greene also helped.

00:17.820 -> 00:25.900
And yes, I think it's sort of traditional by starting behind time, with ten minutes behind time.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.940
We hope to catch up.

00:30.720 --> 00:36.320
Well I would sort of like to, as coordinator of the chairman, Paul Stokes,

00:37.060 --> 00:39.260
never having attended a science fiction convention before,

00:40.020 --> 00:44.760
wanted me to introduce the convention, since I have attended a few.

00:45.560 --> 00:50.720
And so I'd just sort of like to give a welcome to everyone, everyone that's come from the state

00:50.720 --> 00:52.740
of the 12th Australian Science Fiction Convention.

00:52.740 --> 01:00.640
And this is in fact the first Australian convention to be held in another state

01:00.640 --> 01:02.300
outside of Sydney or Melbourne.

01:04.860 --> 01:07.980
And as far as there's some sort of a first.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.970
And well, I think at this stage, first of all, I should introduce our guest of honour,

01:14.970 --> 01:21.530
which is John Foester, who's a...

01:22.490 --> 01:29.930
And the man that's going to be introducing a lot of the Paul Stokes on my left.

01:33.450 --> 01:38.930
Well the little fellow in the corner at the tape recorder is Rod Hannah.

01:38.930 --> 01:47.130
And he's told me that he doesn't want anyone to touch the expensive equipment over there.

01:47.330 --> 01:48.030
So don't touch him.

01:50.890 --> 01:54.110
Responsible for the film is John Hewitt on my right.

01:57.290 --> 02:03.170
And the guy that's getting to give you some music this afternoon is Mike Clarke in the blue on my right.

02:07.350 --> 02:11.290
Well, there's other people that you're going to meet during the convention.

02:12.010 --> 02:14.510
People like Jeff Harris, who's sitting down at the front.

02:15.630 --> 02:18.750
And some of his helpers, namely Joy Window.

02:19.990 --> 02:21.130
He's got a hand in everything.

02:23.290 --> 02:28.670
The only other committee member here at the moment, responsible for the auction,

02:28.670 --> 02:31.450
is Paul Anderson up near the bank.

02:35.430 --> 02:38.910
Well, at this stage we've got a few announcements to make.

02:39.810 --> 02:47.090
First of all, anyone that hasn't collected banquet tickets should go down and see Gary Mason some stage afternoon.

02:47.910 --> 02:53.230
And also anyone that wants to go to the banquet and hasn't bought a ticket should go down and see him,

02:53.230 --> 02:54.650
because they're selling fast.

02:55.630 --> 03:01.810
And we've got a limit of 40 attending the banquet, and it's almost full up, I believe.

03:03.750 --> 03:12.470
I've also been informed by Lincoln College people that cars should not be parked out in the alcove down there.

03:13.350 --> 03:15.590
In fact, they should be left in the street, apparently.

03:18.430 --> 03:25.010
And also there's a coffee machine at the back of the room, which is 10 cents.

03:26.650 --> 03:29.310
There's a coffee machine as well, which should be operating.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.030
It's going to be operating 15 cents.

03:30.850 --> 03:31.470
Starts the room.

03:33.230 --> 03:35.830
And there is one alteration in the program.

03:37.030 --> 03:38.070
It's on Saturday.

03:39.230 --> 03:47.210
At 6.30pm, John Breeden's comic slides has been changed to sometime after the awards banquet.

03:49.570 --> 03:52.410
And I think that's the only alteration at the moment.

03:54.610 --> 04:01.650
Something without further ado we'll call the past two, which is just on time.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.850
We'll start with the panel.

04:04.550 --> 04:06.110
Yes, Alex, Stu, why don't you?

04:07.310 --> 04:11.430
Yes, which is going to be introduced by John Hewitt and Paul Stokes.

04:12.810 --> 04:15.410
One spoiler announcement. Don't go touching the film screen.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.390
It's hanging by here at the moment, and I'd rather it didn't fall down.

04:19.950 --> 04:21.370
Who's going to go?

04:21.570 --> 04:23.170
Who's going to go?

04:23.750 --> 04:26.310
Who'll draw you into the conversation or use your motor stack?

04:27.410 --> 04:27.930
Right.

04:29.550 --> 04:30.250
Go ahead.

04:32.330 --> 04:33.470
Oh, it works.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.010
Good afternoon.

04:37.810 --> 04:44.090
With the ever-growing permission in our society, we have decided that it's time that we looked at sex in science fiction.

04:45.490 --> 04:46.490
All right, go on.

04:48.790 --> 04:55.290
Well, we're going to read some examples of packages from various books I've picked out, but I see there are children in the audience.

04:55.490 --> 04:55.990
No, you won't.

04:58.230 --> 05:02.430
We will, however, discuss various aspects of sex in science fiction.

05:02.910 --> 05:04.210
Not necessarily in that order.

05:11.290 --> 05:11.770
Um...

05:11.770 --> 05:13.730
I can't think of any.

05:14.310 --> 05:17.250
What are you feeling about some of the books you've been reading in the last week?

05:17.910 --> 05:25.470
Yeah, so I've been borrowing a large number of books from Alan and plowing my way through them, things like The Standing Joy by Wyman Gwyn.

05:28.310 --> 05:30.650
The Book of Skulls by Robert Silverberg.

05:31.310 --> 05:33.670
It didn't quite finish that one. It's rather dull.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.930
Productions of Time by John Brunner.

05:38.750 --> 05:43.810
I might as well start discussing some writer's aspects to sex.

05:45.090 --> 05:49.070
I'll start with Phil, who's going to imagine over his here somewhere.

05:55.390 --> 05:58.810
I guess there are various ways you'd look at sex in science fiction.

05:59.010 --> 06:05.670
You can have either...dividing into categories, you can have either sexual customs in a future society.

06:06.810 --> 06:08.970
Totally alien forms of sex.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.270
Recognizable forms of sex of an alien.

06:13.630 --> 06:14.950
And various aspects like this.

06:16.390 --> 06:20.290
And then again there's just normal...

06:20.990 --> 06:28.130
Almost normal sex introduced into a science fiction book, just not really as part of the plot.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.110
In the Book of Skulls by Silverberg,

06:34.330 --> 06:37.110
he depicts sex in a future society.

06:37.630 --> 06:41.450
They're allowed to know...not so far in the future.

06:41.690 --> 06:44.970
Four young men go looking for immortality.

06:47.330 --> 06:53.830
The sex in it is, I guess, more or less the way sex is in New York nowadays.

06:54.450 --> 06:58.810
A very casual you go along, you pick up a member of the opposite sex for the night.

06:59.730 --> 07:03.970
But surely he's just introduced sex into this book because it's sort of contemporary.

07:04.670 --> 07:06.590
And then he's just sort of wanting to sell the book.

07:07.090 --> 07:11.130
Put a bit of sex into the violence and not really relevant to the plotters.

07:11.470 --> 07:11.890
Not really.

07:13.550 --> 07:16.110
Moving along. Moving right along the world inside.

07:16.330 --> 07:17.770
This is the one I meant to see up in the first place.

07:19.730 --> 07:23.310
There are a large number of people, e.g. something like a million people,

07:23.390 --> 07:25.370
living in one building, two miles high.

07:26.850 --> 07:32.670
Now, fairly obvious sexual customs in a society like that are going to be much different.

07:33.430 --> 07:39.830
In this case, there exists almost a society of free love.

07:40.130 --> 07:44.290
Anyone can walk in your front door and demand a sleep with your wife, and you can't say no.

07:48.670 --> 07:53.990
Whether...I think, although he seems to indicate in the book that most people go along with this,

07:53.990 --> 07:56.050
I don't think anyone really agrees with it.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.150
There still exists a form of jealousy.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.530
Nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live there, I suppose.

08:01.790 --> 08:03.370
True. I'd just keep it yet away.

08:04.250 --> 08:10.610
I think in the world inside, the free love aspect is freely accepted by the majority of people.

08:12.530 --> 08:17.210
Not so. There's one character in it who was very jealous about his wife.

08:17.350 --> 08:19.370
There's one character out of how many millions.

08:20.730 --> 08:26.330
Well, this still was very right in the book about a typical group of people inside the building.

08:26.690 --> 08:33.310
I think he did. I think he wrote the book about a typical part of future society.

08:38.310 --> 08:42.610
Yeah, but it seemed to me on reading it, I guess it was just personal impression that

08:43.270 --> 08:49.750
there wasn't anyone in it who subconsciously really liked other people walking in the front door and sleeping with their wife.

08:50.270 --> 08:52.190
Yeah, but it doesn't feel like there's really...

08:52.190 --> 08:53.230
I mean, he doesn't say it.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.390
...talk about only a few people.

08:55.310 --> 08:58.150
And those people are people in particular positions.

08:58.510 --> 09:01.690
One is a fairly high administrative rank.

09:01.830 --> 09:06.150
One is a historian studying sex customs in the 20th century.

09:06.390 --> 09:07.210
One's a musician.

09:07.530 --> 09:08.850
One's a musician, if you're funny.

09:09.730 --> 09:16.150
But don't you think that in this book, the world inside, despite being presumably tolerant towards sex,

09:16.310 --> 09:21.970
they aren't really tolerant towards sort of abnormal human behaviour and that everyone says cramped

09:21.970 --> 09:29.250
that they've got to tolerate one another and the guy in that book was cast out and he was finally...

09:29.250 --> 09:30.190
he was cool.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.590
Yeah, one chap had to leave it.

09:33.910 --> 09:36.330
Despite being sort of liberal in one respect,

09:36.330 --> 09:38.330
it sort of turned out to be...

09:39.030 --> 09:41.530
it was not really free love in that case.

09:41.610 --> 09:42.110
It was enforced.

09:43.070 --> 09:43.890
You know, you have to go out.

09:43.890 --> 09:46.030
Yeah, well, it is a...

09:46.030 --> 09:50.630
it looks like a free love society on the surface, but as I said, I don't think any of them really

09:53.190 --> 09:55.730
like people walking in and saying, you know,

09:56.230 --> 09:58.270
I want your wife at some stage.

09:58.310 --> 10:01.210
But then I seem to mind walking somewhere else and saying, I'd like your wife.

10:01.210 --> 10:02.390
Well, the...

10:02.390 --> 10:03.350
I think that's not what was it.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.930
It's not the main character in that.

10:06.070 --> 10:07.130
It's not supposed to be people.

10:07.890 --> 10:08.830
That's why I have to leave.

10:10.690 --> 10:13.850
He was only one character in the small chapter of the book.

10:14.230 --> 10:15.790
I was thinking more of the historian.

10:16.130 --> 10:21.050
I think he actually objected to other people sleeping with his wife.

10:22.390 --> 10:22.570
Yes?

10:23.570 --> 10:24.470
I have a question.

10:24.470 --> 10:24.710
I have a question.

10:25.930 --> 10:28.870
If Dalek is one of you, what are the other two like?

10:29.450 --> 10:31.090
How do you say, good Dalek?

10:33.430 --> 10:34.510
I don't know.

10:34.530 --> 10:36.450
Well, we only have one Dalek.

10:36.530 --> 10:37.890
I don't see how it's...

10:42.570 --> 10:48.010
I think I came up with that title, that phrase at the committee meeting.

10:48.150 --> 10:49.530
It was just because it rhymed well.

10:49.830 --> 10:51.290
We decided to...

10:52.490 --> 10:54.610
I mean, we have, you know, seemed a better title.

10:55.890 --> 10:57.750
Um, do Dalek truly enjoy it?

10:58.210 --> 10:58.590
Yes.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.230
Do we enjoy it?

11:01.510 --> 11:02.810
It's on the committee meeting.

11:03.690 --> 11:04.970
Uh, I don't think that's good for them.

11:05.870 --> 11:08.270
The man inside the Dalek probably enjoys it.

11:09.370 --> 11:09.810
Okay?

11:21.610 --> 11:23.170
I think I'll just...

11:23.170 --> 11:24.430
I think I'll just...

11:24.430 --> 11:26.470
I'll just start discussion over it.

11:26.970 --> 11:28.590
I mean, it's not...

11:29.710 --> 11:33.130
It's generally like, you know, I think I just...

11:33.130 --> 11:35.750
Um, clean brain...

11:35.750 --> 11:36.970
Yes, but...

11:36.970 --> 11:38.230
Do we enjoy doing it?

11:39.230 --> 11:42.830
I'm afraid we've had to remove the sexual organs on our Daleks.

11:42.910 --> 11:43.610
They're going on TV.

11:44.290 --> 11:44.830
I don't know.

11:46.550 --> 11:48.050
Okay, so, and...

11:49.750 --> 11:50.230
Um...

11:50.230 --> 11:51.470
Anyway, moving right along.

11:53.210 --> 11:53.690
Um...

11:53.690 --> 11:55.510
You sort of want to comment on the fact that

11:55.890 --> 12:01.750
sort of every sexual interlude in a silverberg will sort of read like every other sort of silverberg.

12:02.350 --> 12:03.430
Uh, another...

12:03.850 --> 12:08.850
In other words, there's a world inside the section that reads exactly the same as in the Summers Man,

12:08.990 --> 12:11.190
which is exactly the same as in Time of Changes.

12:11.930 --> 12:12.450
Uh, yes.

12:12.450 --> 12:15.550
Even in any of the silverbergs or other ones, so...

12:16.210 --> 12:20.330
It sort of gets to the stage where it's just like, um, sort of...

12:20.330 --> 12:22.130
railway carriages coupling and uncoupling.

12:22.490 --> 12:25.330
Oh, there's not to be mechanical about it.

12:25.710 --> 12:27.630
There's no railway carriages in Georgia.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.170
Well, they seem to have been out and laid anyway.

12:33.270 --> 12:33.510
Yeah.

12:34.210 --> 12:37.790
Why do you have Daleks from a private auto-serve?

12:38.390 --> 12:39.010
Oh, God.

12:41.850 --> 12:43.610
Yeah? I thought you were a junior member.

12:44.130 --> 12:48.570
I think in the Summers Man, now, as I imagine, it's going to be his books.

12:49.310 --> 12:53.850
I think he'd make quite a case of his most brilliant writer in science fiction.

12:54.630 --> 12:58.370
He really seems to draw a second world wall just to...

12:58.370 --> 12:58.570
...jude.

13:00.050 --> 13:02.930
Uh, quite ordinary science fiction novels.

13:03.690 --> 13:06.450
I suppose, don't be tedious when you write that section.

13:06.450 --> 13:11.930
In simple reason, it's this term, you know, pre-load, whatever it means.

13:12.430 --> 13:15.290
But there's a difference of left.

13:15.990 --> 13:20.370
So, the feeling of the end of life, you know, the sexual intercourse,

13:20.830 --> 13:25.730
the relationship between the other and the method of playing himself as he...

13:25.730 --> 13:32.710
Uh, there's a particular course of time of changes where a guy can't go to sleep without putting himself off, you know,

13:33.810 --> 13:39.510
and I don't think it helps the narrative or anything to it, whatever.

13:40.090 --> 13:41.330
It's just a total...

13:41.330 --> 13:45.370
I think he's the most brilliant writer in science fiction.

13:46.830 --> 13:47.230
Oh, yeah.

13:47.550 --> 13:48.590
I think he's kind of doing it.

13:49.270 --> 13:52.810
And of course, some of his stuff was published in Ked White's Amazing,

13:52.990 --> 13:57.050
and sort of using trendy, poor-letter words in Amazing.

13:57.890 --> 14:01.130
Things like The Second Trip, which is another silverberg book,

14:01.390 --> 14:06.230
was that sort of caused quite a few, or apparently, when it was published.

14:06.810 --> 14:08.050
Well, let's hit his magazines.

14:08.370 --> 14:09.990
You can't put all that in words.

14:10.670 --> 14:10.950
Yeah.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.610
The paperback market is supposedly different.

14:15.510 --> 14:17.790
But, I mean, he does figure out every science fiction magazine,

14:18.090 --> 14:21.910
and you know that there's things in that all that knowledge he's accepted or not, perhaps.

14:22.310 --> 14:23.830
Yeah, we're here from the adolescence, yes.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.430
I have to get to my decision, actually.

14:27.670 --> 14:28.930
He probably hasn't do that.

14:29.130 --> 14:30.690
He's touching all my shit, so he can't do it.

14:31.210 --> 14:32.870
Oh, so he can't do it.

14:32.870 --> 14:33.870
So he can do that, right?

14:36.610 --> 14:40.030
Yeah, I agree with you that silverberg sex is very tedious,

14:40.350 --> 14:42.070
or at least I think it is in...

14:42.070 --> 14:45.570
Son of a man, I don't think I read more than a third of the book before I gave up.

14:45.570 --> 14:49.210
I just found that it's nearly all totally unrealistic sex,

14:49.290 --> 14:51.090
and it just didn't mean anything to me.

14:53.090 --> 14:55.390
Shall we move on to discuss someone else?

14:56.090 --> 14:57.490
We'll discuss someone else.

14:57.650 --> 14:59.470
How about Phil Farmer?

15:00.110 --> 15:00.290
Yeah.

15:00.530 --> 15:03.170
This is the only book of Phil Farmer's life that's ever,

15:03.230 --> 15:06.390
so I've only read about the first chapter in which he has a woman first.

15:09.230 --> 15:10.090
What's been the book?

15:11.210 --> 15:11.950
Time Stop.

15:13.030 --> 15:17.030
Are you aware that Farmer didn't write the first two pages of that?

15:17.630 --> 15:19.330
Oh, well, no wonder. I didn't read the...

15:19.330 --> 15:22.270
Well, for the girls' breast-getting ripped orphan, or that sort of thing.

15:22.430 --> 15:23.030
Yeah, yeah.

15:23.450 --> 15:24.130
You tried to seduce her.

15:24.130 --> 15:29.050
Well, that appeared in the vegan edition of the series of 65 of that kind of work.

15:29.590 --> 15:31.190
Remember the late 50s?

15:31.650 --> 15:38.690
And the editors always wrote an introductory chapter to...

15:39.330 --> 15:42.330
And I'm rather surprised that Farmer didn't, um...

15:43.250 --> 15:43.850
Well, ask for that.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.070
Maybe he did it himself, I don't know, basically.

15:46.070 --> 15:50.110
It's not in the original edition of Mock-It-Rust in the magazine.

15:51.870 --> 15:56.790
Did the vegan food-shrine-whip production actually paragraph through the book, in the main?

15:57.450 --> 15:58.210
I don't think so.

15:58.270 --> 15:58.490
Yeah.

15:58.850 --> 16:06.230
And now, the only one they didn't have to write in production, too, was either flesh or...

16:06.230 --> 16:07.710
No, it was a bit of a bit of a...

16:08.670 --> 16:10.190
Well, there's only one type of a public.

16:10.190 --> 16:14.010
They did not have to write a juicy, happening, kind of...

16:16.230 --> 16:16.750
Um...

16:16.750 --> 16:17.670
Lord Tideg.

16:22.790 --> 16:30.510
Well, actually, I don't think this time stop is a very good example of Philip Jose Farmer's work,

16:30.670 --> 16:34.090
which includes sectioned science fiction, which I think is one of his most boring books.

16:35.810 --> 16:38.070
Probably one of the...

16:38.070 --> 16:39.850
I can't let that pass.

16:40.290 --> 16:40.770
Time stop?

16:42.170 --> 16:44.610
I think it's possibly one of the three best books.

16:45.910 --> 16:47.370
I haven't read it in eight years.

16:49.190 --> 16:50.270
Can we get back to that?

16:50.370 --> 16:51.510
Most of it in the love of Philip's novel.

16:52.710 --> 16:53.670
No, it hasn't.

16:53.910 --> 16:58.970
It's all well-opened, really, in that, recently, about 10 years ago.

17:01.050 --> 17:04.390
But, last time I read Mock-It-Rust was in that format.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.910
It still is, I think, in the original, well-written book.

17:06.910 --> 17:12.190
Oh, well-written, but I think it's still rather boring compared to some things like the Riverwald series.

17:12.850 --> 17:14.950
Well, I've got a lot of ideas.

17:15.590 --> 17:17.610
I mean, what about?

17:17.830 --> 17:19.190
But it's still a very well-opened.

17:19.390 --> 17:19.610
Yeah.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.950
Do you have any sound sound, maybe?

17:23.490 --> 17:26.590
What would you consider Lord Tideg with science fiction?

17:28.590 --> 17:30.910
I haven't read it, so...

17:31.750 --> 17:33.910
I don't know.

17:33.910 --> 17:34.770
I don't know.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.290
Certainly, there's science fiction in the Bible,

17:38.770 --> 17:41.230
which is not really what it's talking about.

17:42.570 --> 17:45.530
If you can tell another little question, please, it's not funny.

17:46.310 --> 17:48.690
It's not a fiction, it's a pen on a...

17:49.230 --> 17:50.150
independent function.

17:52.090 --> 17:56.850
Then again, Farmer seems to have sold out from writing a genuine sort of science fiction novel

17:56.850 --> 17:59.670
with alien sex ideas, something like the Lover's,

17:59.670 --> 18:03.590
who's sort of gone on to destroy pornographic novels for Essex House.

18:04.590 --> 18:07.650
Have you read any so-called pornographic novels really, Ted?

18:07.910 --> 18:08.950
No, I have actually, yes.

18:09.230 --> 18:11.150
I think it's far better than I love it.

18:11.390 --> 18:14.330
Far better than anything that he's done in the late 16th century.

18:15.030 --> 18:18.010
Well, I suppose they're sort of...

18:18.010 --> 18:18.330
Yeah.

18:21.410 --> 18:21.850
16th...

18:22.830 --> 18:23.570
16th century.

18:24.930 --> 18:25.670
Ember and Rhee.

18:27.510 --> 18:29.330
I'm looking out the window for the next convention.

18:30.430 --> 18:30.750
Huh.

18:32.730 --> 18:34.810
I'll say something about John Boyd.

18:35.470 --> 18:38.330
I just, a couple of weeks ago, I read Sex and the High Command,

18:38.630 --> 18:40.350
just particularly from this panel.

18:42.490 --> 18:48.430
I don't think Boyd has any idea whatsoever about what sex is about.

18:55.170 --> 18:58.170
Anyone on this panel who's a virgin, please say no.

18:59.310 --> 18:59.990
Say there.

19:07.290 --> 19:14.570
Well, the idea of this is that women in the world get hold of something

19:14.570 --> 19:20.610
which is a substitute for their normal sex life, something called vital earth.

19:20.850 --> 19:22.930
It does away with men, apparently.

19:23.070 --> 19:27.270
They shove it up there, wipe it, and give them a big kiss.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.110
They're called V-bombs, I think.

19:35.490 --> 19:36.990
V-yogons, I think.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.610
Apparently, a son-how also causes fertilization,

19:40.830 --> 19:42.550
you know, doing away with men completely.

19:42.550 --> 19:46.470
And I found that the men in this book were totally emasculated.

19:46.970 --> 19:54.550
They're just, when women refuse them, they're totally incapable of doing anything about it.

19:54.850 --> 19:59.550
And I think, in general, from what I've read of Boyd,

20:00.710 --> 20:03.870
either his heroes are superstars, you know,

20:04.090 --> 20:06.010
they go through so many women that's unrealistic,

20:07.050 --> 20:09.430
or else they just can't approach a woman at all.

20:09.430 --> 20:15.670
I don't think there's a single male character I've come across in a Boyd novel

20:16.730 --> 20:20.110
who has what I consider to be a normal, healthy sex life.

20:21.910 --> 20:27.830
In this, when the women refuse their men, the men just don't do anything about it.

20:27.890 --> 20:30.370
They're totally incapable of doing anything about it.

20:31.770 --> 20:36.170
The average guy at rape is wife, if she said no, or divorce her, one or the other.

20:41.150 --> 20:44.510
You're talking about it just in terms of sex and not getting sex,

20:44.610 --> 20:46.430
but what about in science fiction aspects?

20:46.790 --> 20:51.470
This is supposed to be a future society where women, you know,

20:51.710 --> 20:54.350
mentally don't feel they don't require men anymore,

20:54.530 --> 20:56.910
and they now physically don't require men anymore.

20:57.610 --> 21:01.890
I mean, you know, the men seem to have grown up with a gigantic inferiority complex,

21:02.130 --> 21:03.030
so they're not good for anything.

21:04.670 --> 21:07.110
You know, it's the type of thing, you know, and they're just

21:07.890 --> 21:09.990
a natural selection dying off.

21:10.230 --> 21:13.730
You know, the weakest to survive because they're the most civilized.

21:13.930 --> 21:17.710
Anybody who's any threat is done away with.

21:18.270 --> 21:21.570
What does the panel think of having sexual relationships in science fiction?

21:25.070 --> 21:27.530
Oh, can you give us some suggestions as well?

21:34.530 --> 21:41.050
I think in that case, homosexuality was necessary in that book for the boys who committed suicide,

21:41.650 --> 21:46.710
because if you remember, four went to find a mortality and only two could have.

21:48.570 --> 21:52.170
One had to voluntarily die, one had to be killed.

21:52.170 --> 21:58.210
And the guy who voluntarily died, I mean, realized he had late sexual sexual...

21:58.210 --> 22:01.150
What an awful cliche in this show, though.

22:02.850 --> 22:04.150
It was this sort of...

22:04.150 --> 22:05.670
It was a quite valid, quite...

22:05.670 --> 22:11.650
It wasn't absolutely necessary.

22:11.890 --> 22:15.150
They could have got any character as mentally unstable committed suicide.

22:17.410 --> 22:20.150
It would then all have to be homosexuals or late homosexuals.

22:22.890 --> 22:23.290
Perfect.

22:24.330 --> 22:28.210
I think it would be a bit unusual that out of four people, two of them are actually

22:28.750 --> 22:30.370
have homosexual tendencies.

22:31.930 --> 22:37.090
In that, one of the characters in this is, well, not strictly homosexual, he's bisexual.

22:38.670 --> 22:42.150
Well, perhaps the panel can go away from the tower of grace if it is,

22:42.150 --> 22:45.350
could you find some good examples of sexual and non-physical?

22:46.150 --> 22:47.190
Sure, there must be some.

22:49.990 --> 22:54.830
Well, Robert Heinle's Glory Road, I think, with the main character in this,

22:55.430 --> 22:57.710
has a reasonable approach to sex.

22:58.190 --> 23:07.710
It seems to me to be the approach of a typical army soldier, you know, habit we're getting to find.

23:07.710 --> 23:10.650
But surely that's a cop-out, you know, and it's a fun book.

23:11.310 --> 23:12.310
True, true.

23:13.190 --> 23:16.110
It's just that the word camel wasn't proved on.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.330
The only sex is an animal.

23:17.550 --> 23:21.070
It's fun sex, you know, if you have a good laugh about it.

23:21.070 --> 23:23.530
Surely it's one of the shortcomings as far as you can edit it.

23:24.290 --> 23:26.470
That fun sex is permissible.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.130
It's the first thing good.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.810
It wasn't any sex on stage in Glory Road anyway.

23:31.030 --> 23:34.150
It was all sort of delayed until after the end of the chapter or something.

23:35.410 --> 23:40.370
Even sort of cop-out when we were sort of showing some girls they had sex with

23:40.370 --> 23:42.330
and they turned out to be, you know, looking too young.

23:42.670 --> 23:48.690
So I don't think he was really realistic in that respect, especially for the song.

23:48.690 --> 23:50.930
Can you not consider it as an example of sexual and non-physical?

23:51.150 --> 23:52.470
No, I don't really think so.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.290
How much is his weight?

23:54.610 --> 23:55.990
I don't know.

23:56.910 --> 23:58.610
Oh, you're going to be able to...

23:58.610 --> 23:59.330
Oh, sorry.

24:02.390 --> 24:08.670
Well actually the Old Piano Evil is a more recent one which is called Time and Up for Love,

24:09.330 --> 24:14.370
which in fact deals with incest and he's sort of having it with his mother and his sisters and everyone.

24:15.050 --> 24:15.370
And the dog.

24:15.530 --> 24:16.510
He sort of, yeah.

24:17.150 --> 24:19.130
Since you are about the only one who's read it.

24:19.370 --> 24:20.490
He's getting on to that.

24:21.090 --> 24:23.330
He's getting to be a real dirty old man, I'm afraid.

24:23.330 --> 24:31.390
Yeah, you can see that in Heinlein you can see the graduation up to about 1960.

24:31.390 --> 24:34.790
You never touch sex apart from saying girls are warm and cuddly.

24:36.110 --> 24:41.590
After that you get books that you typically have Glory Road in which it's known that the hero

24:41.590 --> 24:45.730
sleeps with a woman but they're no explicit sex or anything.

24:46.290 --> 24:48.390
From what you say in the latest books.

24:49.030 --> 24:53.530
But even in the latest one it's still sex and fun so he doesn't really want to get too serious.

24:55.790 --> 24:57.410
Aley Hyman's a latent homosexual.

24:59.030 --> 25:02.490
I think he had a sort of something about his mother though.

25:03.090 --> 25:07.450
It's a time travel story and the character goes back and falls in love with his mother.

25:09.090 --> 25:09.910
He was a good good good.

25:10.910 --> 25:11.250
Pardon?

25:12.850 --> 25:13.810
Or you're zombies.

25:14.510 --> 25:17.370
The character is really known as a father and mother though.

25:18.270 --> 25:20.330
It's a good story, it's a second destiny.

25:21.250 --> 25:21.910
What's your problem?

25:25.070 --> 25:26.450
Who can understand the problem?

25:26.730 --> 25:30.770
Is it normal to have a different kind of problem for a normal or hard-of-the-world?

25:32.050 --> 25:34.530
Probably because I'm a real bad kid.

25:35.930 --> 25:36.550
And that's why.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.130
It's like a vowel or a channel covering those things.

25:40.130 --> 25:40.990
I'm sure.

25:41.890 --> 25:46.090
I don't think they thought about how many people on stage.

25:47.250 --> 25:50.190
But it has a very nice teacher like me who's wife.

25:50.510 --> 25:52.230
Who can get out of the way.

25:52.790 --> 25:54.270
I wasn't normal about sex.

25:54.270 --> 25:55.930
That's right. I was going to have a sex novel.

25:56.770 --> 26:02.810
I don't think this is perhaps where someone's fiction for working their genres was considered.

26:03.210 --> 26:06.310
Someone's fiction about sex, about sex knowledge.

26:07.110 --> 26:09.870
That's not how the sad novel was getting.

26:12.990 --> 26:17.030
And like the third story, it all made my brothers, which you wouldn't want to marry your sister.

26:18.990 --> 26:20.310
In the actual story, she's a worm.

26:21.630 --> 26:26.490
But even then, he was coy and avoided the use of the word, Ollivore, using it.

26:31.150 --> 26:31.890
One thing.

26:32.870 --> 26:38.150
You've got a sort of distinguish between novels striving to be just sort of trendy and that.

26:38.670 --> 26:43.510
By including sex scenes and sort of stories that you're sort of talking about.

26:43.810 --> 26:47.230
Ted Sturgeon's earliest out-of-the-short, those include sex.

26:48.610 --> 26:50.450
Is that an inherent part of the plot?

26:50.450 --> 26:56.530
I think more than human is another interesting example.

26:58.390 --> 27:00.710
Sort of a guest-ult then.

27:01.790 --> 27:10.110
Sort of some reasonably realistic descriptions of what I thought to be reasonable people and characterizations.

27:11.610 --> 27:15.610
Especially the, I think, 80s-3 novel there.

27:42.650 --> 27:44.270
Doesn't it work on the camera?

27:45.410 --> 27:51.030
I think they would actually, you know, just two people say that a lonely or a lonely together.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.330
Especially that sort of alien being.

27:55.210 --> 27:58.170
They're not only being being, but they're doing smaller.

27:59.490 --> 28:02.450
They only have, you know, the people that say.

28:02.610 --> 28:04.730
They're obviously attracted to one another, so why not?

28:12.610 --> 28:18.370
Well, there's another aspect of sex and this is alien sex, which is totally unrealistic.

28:18.750 --> 28:22.590
E.G. supposing a race which has six different sexes.

28:23.190 --> 28:29.290
I personally can't recall anything. Having read anything even like this, I don't know if anyone in the audience has.

28:29.570 --> 28:31.470
I would say it was a language that's kind of sex.

28:33.090 --> 28:34.490
Say a few words, big meal.

28:34.950 --> 28:36.750
I don't know how you worked at the house.

28:37.290 --> 28:37.730
Why?

28:41.570 --> 28:43.150
Supersex is some sex with insects.

28:43.650 --> 28:44.790
You've gone on and on to that part.

28:45.030 --> 28:45.470
Insects?

28:47.670 --> 28:48.450
Break it down.

28:49.390 --> 28:55.750
How about the Sheldon, the boring sex group in 2005?

28:58.170 --> 28:59.470
Yes, I can look at that.

29:00.770 --> 29:05.830
If you've done a two-point difficulty, but you have children that haven't been born for three hours ago,

29:06.770 --> 29:09.630
please run home and take your mind off of the 16.

29:10.310 --> 29:13.450
And I think that if you don't have all these people, then you never get rid of them.

29:13.770 --> 29:14.290
I don't know, of course.

29:16.530 --> 29:17.630
That's rather complicated.

29:21.230 --> 29:21.930
I don't know.

29:27.110 --> 29:27.990
We would.

29:30.370 --> 29:34.170
Actually, Jeff, I think of as many sexes as there are people, we can start with that.

29:35.990 --> 29:37.090
That's quite contentious.

29:37.090 --> 30:05.090
I don't know.

30:05.090 --> 30:05.990
I think it's a very interesting question.

30:10.650 --> 30:14.410
If it's Soryazumon, it's not a very good example to take.

30:15.330 --> 30:15.870
I don't know.

30:16.570 --> 30:25.270
I think that in the early 20s, what was the penetration of turning the gas into hot?

30:26.130 --> 30:28.870
Well, then that's just been good happen.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.110
That's a great text, sir.

30:32.890 --> 30:37.290
We're going to talk about sex for each of us in a text read more than a little while.

30:39.930 --> 30:40.370
Yes.

30:45.910 --> 30:46.810
Yes, I have.

30:50.170 --> 30:51.970
I thought I asked that a while ago.

30:58.970 --> 30:59.630
I don't know.

31:00.330 --> 31:21.730
I think it's that.

31:25.730 --> 31:32.950
Actually, if everyone's talking about a boy, no one's mentioned one of his novels, which I think is rather amusing.

31:33.270 --> 31:34.910
It's all about sex, rackles of heaven.

31:35.950 --> 31:41.830
I think this novel, more than any, gets the idea that a boy is having everyone on anyway.

31:42.570 --> 31:45.790
You can't really believe his characters, because he doesn't believe in himself.

31:46.830 --> 31:48.350
The reason that he doesn't believe in his characters.

31:48.550 --> 31:55.490
It's a trick when you're not a very good writer to begin deciding across the rightful art.

31:56.310 --> 31:59.110
And I found the rightful art to be unrealable.

32:01.490 --> 32:08.710
On the other hand, I found that the last 40 pages of the popular debate, as good as if not better,

32:08.710 --> 32:14.730
is that anything that a student has done in a similar manner to the history of the Ukraine,

32:15.330 --> 32:18.190
the rest of the book is pretty bad.

32:18.690 --> 32:21.430
That's why I'm thinking of the flower in which they were born and all that.

32:22.230 --> 32:23.530
It's very, very well done.

32:23.670 --> 32:30.890
It just goes to show, I proved my earlier point, that his characters don't have a still-done kind of approach to normal sex relationships.

32:31.090 --> 32:32.410
They've got to do it via a flower.

32:32.410 --> 32:37.350
You're getting the sense of all sexual relationships, and you're getting what they're the rightful characters.

32:38.690 --> 32:39.810
Be careful, John.

32:43.390 --> 32:46.930
It's a phrase that usually brings out what he's written.

32:47.430 --> 32:51.250
But in that case, he's getting the phrase like normal sexual relationships,

32:51.970 --> 32:55.090
when you're discussing the bizarre sexual relationships of science fiction.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.590
Science fiction is not the normal one.

32:57.590 --> 33:00.630
Yes, he's just counter-flying that.

33:01.690 --> 33:03.830
It's just very, very age-rigging.

33:03.970 --> 33:04.670
It's a farmer's book.

33:04.970 --> 33:15.690
Now, the inter-catholic image of the thing could not have been written without the wild, weird sexual imagination that poured into it.

33:15.710 --> 33:23.330
And because it doesn't have any of the restrictions of the science fiction sphere, he could really, pardon the phrase, let's go.

33:27.930 --> 33:33.450
You can't relate any sort of normal sexual activity to that book.

33:33.790 --> 33:38.530
In some way, I think you've got to define a good sex relation.

33:39.330 --> 33:42.450
And I suppose that is one that you enjoy without...

33:42.450 --> 33:51.450
Right, it's one that you'd enjoy, your partner would enjoy, and you wouldn't have any guilt feelings or complexes about it.

33:51.450 --> 33:55.710
You'd have a hell of a time being kind of a magicist, John.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.530
So this is where the whole...

34:02.130 --> 34:04.930
Yeah, but that's part of the enjoyment side, I guess.

34:06.790 --> 34:09.430
It's not good to get too deep into it.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.950
I'm just afraid it's normal.

34:13.330 --> 34:14.050
Okay, I'll try.

34:14.050 --> 34:21.890
I think that a relationship which is satisfactory to both parties without guilt feelings or lots of authenticity or something like that,

34:21.890 --> 34:24.570
it's pretty hard to reply to that type of fiction writing that's there.

34:24.870 --> 34:30.470
I wish I could listen to that.

34:32.150 --> 34:33.110
Yes, well...

34:33.110 --> 34:38.370
Okay, you're speaking about sort of abnormal or this sort of different sort of sexual relationships,

34:38.430 --> 34:44.430
not about the relationship that the character in the Ellison story has to his dog.

34:45.530 --> 34:50.330
If anyone's read this story, is this sort of a love story or what do you consider that?

34:50.410 --> 34:52.830
Well, not a whole lot of it, but it's a book in the top story.

34:53.630 --> 34:57.870
You may recall that the other surgeon won't find a perversion.

34:59.290 --> 35:04.030
Does anyone think that the exclusion of all others and that includes the missionary position?

35:07.390 --> 35:10.130
This helps to do when we talk about normal sexual relationships.

35:14.110 --> 35:14.590
Comments?

35:15.030 --> 35:16.030
What's the mission of the missionary?

35:18.290 --> 35:19.450
We've done it with the missionary.

35:22.330 --> 35:26.350
They're talking about alien sex. What about in a film that's Strange Relations?

35:27.090 --> 35:36.010
There's a series of stories in that and there's one chap in there who has been married to numerous aliens

35:37.170 --> 35:41.390
throughout the travels throughout the galaxy, the spider woman and octopus woman.

35:41.570 --> 35:45.930
There's another one, a giant blob which molds itself around him.

35:45.930 --> 35:52.270
And I think it finally gets trapped inside some giant snail or something like that.

35:54.090 --> 35:55.670
How would you classify that?

35:56.110 --> 36:06.230
Well, they ask stories about sex and of course him and Farrell explored the stagnant relationship to his mother, his sisters.

36:08.650 --> 36:11.890
It's years since the first time there was a money crisis.

36:12.930 --> 36:17.470
There are psychological fantasies, extremely Freudian.

36:19.050 --> 36:25.310
And they are not about normal sexual relationships.

36:26.750 --> 36:31.690
And certainly in supervirtual relationships, for example, he's doing all the water wishes for.

36:35.230 --> 36:39.110
He's writing about what he thinks is really flat sexual activity.

36:39.910 --> 36:42.070
Gosh, wow, feeling about it.

36:44.510 --> 36:47.110
It's the same with the modern Strange Relations plan.

36:47.630 --> 36:48.970
So excited about it.

36:49.350 --> 36:51.090
Boy and girls get a sex in it.

36:51.850 --> 36:53.990
They swap around and it's a good thing.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.990
I think Farrell is going to write it.

37:02.270 --> 37:08.250
He's using it as a source of shock or his funny words.

37:09.230 --> 37:12.090
But to explore things he thinks it's a good story.

37:12.470 --> 37:15.170
Would you write that it's good sex and science fiction?

37:15.490 --> 37:16.830
A good sexual science fiction.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.950
Why wouldn't you use a label like that?

37:20.570 --> 37:25.150
I would say it's an interesting science fiction story that explores the various sexual attitudes in relationships.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.590
Although you talk about legal levels.

37:30.650 --> 37:37.610
I think it was that one open to me, my sister, which has been found in science fiction.

37:37.610 --> 37:40.650
There was probably one in those particular theories.

37:41.730 --> 37:44.910
Which was almost a precursor of the Essex House novel.

37:45.170 --> 37:50.770
It had the great long snake-like thing going down the hero's mouth.

37:51.050 --> 37:53.650
It may help with the poor.

37:55.890 --> 38:05.190
There's a world-removement of supervirtuals where he is just injecting sexual relationships into his stories to juice them up.

38:10.970 --> 38:17.450
Would you say that Silverberg and Jack's sexual relationships in his stories?

38:17.630 --> 38:22.550
We decided that Compton does the same thing in one of his stories.

38:24.270 --> 38:34.930
There's always Jack's Silverberg story.

38:34.930 --> 38:39.790
He's a filing system of character, actions, reactions and emotions.

38:40.070 --> 38:45.710
He just pushes them and puts them in and tells them that it's his characters that they feel.

38:48.590 --> 38:50.790
He just needs to be thrown into a random chapter.

38:51.350 --> 38:53.670
There's no real feeling at all.

38:53.910 --> 38:56.750
So actually sex things don't work because they're dragged in.

38:57.090 --> 38:58.770
Before the other one, he plays the homosexual.

38:59.850 --> 39:00.890
He drags that in.

39:01.490 --> 39:03.830
The horrible thing about sexuality is that he kills himself.

39:05.690 --> 39:06.970
There's no real conviction.

39:07.150 --> 39:09.130
I can't believe any of Silverberg's writings.

39:10.170 --> 39:12.510
I tried reading the second trip recently.

39:13.010 --> 39:16.510
About 50 pages, he was screaming so loudly.

39:18.570 --> 39:20.290
You read one and you read them all.

39:21.050 --> 39:22.330
Especially with the sex things.

39:30.130 --> 39:32.550
Maybe something we haven't discussed yet is

39:34.470 --> 39:39.070
perhaps we have briefly in the world inside of the society in which sex is

39:39.990 --> 39:44.470
governed and controlled by the government, E.G. and the wanting seed by Anthony Burgess.

39:45.710 --> 39:56.590
The main theme of this book is that because of overpopulation, the government is advocating

39:56.590 --> 40:04.470
and encouraging homosexuality and castration and anything in fact to limit births.

40:05.830 --> 40:07.810
Has anyone got any comments?

40:09.410 --> 40:10.750
No, it doesn't work.

40:10.750 --> 40:14.450
The populace eventually rejects it.

40:15.430 --> 40:15.970
That's usual.

40:16.770 --> 40:18.370
In one way or another.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.290
The whole society breaks down.

40:21.370 --> 40:23.150
In fact they start eating each other.

40:24.330 --> 40:27.530
Do you think Silverberg is a virgin?

40:34.450 --> 40:40.570
The panel reads the article about the age of the NGO by the Gatting-Miles

40:40.570 --> 40:46.050
in science fiction on the sex and population problem.

40:47.910 --> 40:52.790
The very good guy, I'm already saying something about the whole problem is trying to suppress

40:52.790 --> 40:57.890
the so-called unnatural age over the years of the so-called unnatural age.

41:01.570 --> 41:14.790
He was just saying anything really unnatural was something like

41:14.790 --> 41:17.590
a foresight of trying or something like that.

41:20.550 --> 41:27.910
Nothing but barrens, extremes, heavens, all the kind of things that are natural.

41:28.710 --> 41:29.770
People do it.

41:30.130 --> 41:31.050
It's natural, yeah.

41:33.690 --> 41:36.150
Something unnatural is flying without wings.

41:37.570 --> 41:38.490
That's what he was giving up.

41:38.490 --> 41:42.590
Do you think we should be there by definition to be natural?

41:45.590 --> 41:47.550
One thing we can do is quite a mess.

41:52.350 --> 41:55.630
Perhaps since we had a question about Supergirl a while ago

41:56.370 --> 42:01.030
I might recall talking about Larry Nivens' article on Superman

42:01.030 --> 42:02.950
and his sexual life.

42:04.010 --> 42:04.670
It's not an opinion.

42:05.630 --> 42:07.450
Most of all, Larry is born there in ways.

42:09.750 --> 42:12.490
The man is still one of the people.

42:12.850 --> 42:17.950
Yes, the very favorite Superman is a man of steel.

42:18.850 --> 42:25.670
He should have no real control over his sexual act.

42:25.670 --> 42:31.190
I've made the first study going to rip the woman apart

42:31.190 --> 42:33.790
the minute he starts making love to her.

42:34.610 --> 42:37.130
And what is playing in the film?

42:38.170 --> 42:41.050
Supergirl's heart is beating ten times more.

42:41.830 --> 42:43.910
Oh, this is playing for the ladies.

42:46.210 --> 42:47.510
Supergirl's also a Superdog.

42:48.690 --> 42:51.170
She was like a kryptonite as a conceptist.

42:57.370 --> 43:01.090
I don't know what that serious side effects is.

43:01.830 --> 43:07.350
I can't believe I can't believe I'm trying to get out of this guy's chunk of kryptonite.

43:10.110 --> 43:11.350
Why, so good.

43:13.270 --> 43:16.430
How is that natural to get for a kryptonite?

43:19.410 --> 43:20.210
Good job.

43:21.050 --> 43:24.110
The world is doing it.

43:24.250 --> 43:26.590
I think I'll just make a call at the wedding or what.

43:39.490 --> 43:40.650
I don't know.

43:40.870 --> 43:41.330
I don't know.

43:41.330 --> 43:42.230
I'd rather be on this one.

43:43.090 --> 43:45.450
I'd have to be on it rather. I knew you knew whatever that was.

43:48.270 --> 43:50.770
I mean, I can do it the way we do it.

43:51.850 --> 43:52.770
How do we do it?

43:56.290 --> 44:01.410
Well, I'll put it on.

44:03.050 --> 44:08.570
I noticed you've got one John Brommer's Productions of Time.

44:08.570 --> 44:10.670
Do you want to mention that one?

44:10.750 --> 44:12.510
Yes, we can discuss John Brommer for a while.

44:12.870 --> 44:14.690
We've still got 20 minutes to fill in.

44:14.870 --> 44:15.770
Oh, I'd have a break.

44:21.170 --> 44:25.510
The idea of this book, while they don't actually have any explicit sex,

44:25.710 --> 44:30.950
is that people from the future sort of take thrills.

44:31.930 --> 44:32.830
I can't catch this.

44:32.830 --> 44:38.690
So you plug yourself in and have a thrill that someone else has experienced.

44:39.570 --> 44:46.510
They get together a bloke who's keen on pornography, a drug addict,

44:47.150 --> 44:50.990
a bloke who's was an alcoholic and now recovered,

44:51.370 --> 44:52.230
but can't touch the stuff.

44:52.770 --> 45:00.790
Homosexual, lesbian, throws them all together and tries to get some good stuff on tape.

45:00.790 --> 45:03.650
So, we're people in the future to enjoy.

45:07.130 --> 45:07.690
Comments?

45:09.010 --> 45:09.610
I'll read it.

45:09.910 --> 45:18.310
I think another one had sort of run as a novel where he's dealing with so-called sexual perversions.

45:18.910 --> 45:23.690
I think possibly he's a little bit like Silberberg and he's just tossing these things in.

45:23.690 --> 45:30.230
And just for the readers' entertainment, it doesn't read that well anyway.

45:31.330 --> 45:35.250
The general theme of this book, the whole theme of the book,

45:35.350 --> 45:37.690
is sort of wrapped around this plot of perversions.

45:38.030 --> 45:43.530
But as it seems to show away from actual sex scenes,

45:45.590 --> 45:47.830
his sex is more or less indirect.

45:47.830 --> 45:53.810
Although he does seem to write it into the plot a lot better than some other writers.

45:55.330 --> 45:57.090
It's necessary it comes in.

45:59.110 --> 46:03.690
Oh, look, let's get off John Brunner. Let's talk about the sex scenes in the book.

46:03.690 --> 46:04.610
Oh, we're on it.

46:05.530 --> 46:07.190
I didn't know you were on it.

46:07.450 --> 46:08.430
Is that how you find them?

46:08.770 --> 46:11.850
Is anyone sort of ready to sex scenes in half a class?

46:13.090 --> 46:14.470
Yes, he has.

46:15.090 --> 46:19.730
Oh, what is the most powerful sex scene in all of science fiction?

46:19.930 --> 46:20.850
It's the fourth window.

46:22.070 --> 46:22.270
Oh, yeah.

46:23.590 --> 46:24.710
Move your credit.

46:26.190 --> 46:30.510
The equation for Moonlander thinks down into this so-called lunatic.

46:31.030 --> 46:37.530
And at one place, a very noble sentence definition or something goes for a girl somewhere.

46:40.510 --> 46:44.470
And when they come back, all of that is going to be more and more unambiguous.

46:45.190 --> 46:47.650
And he says, hmm, they have been thinking, not people,

46:48.070 --> 46:50.390
but I can think it will do it.

46:52.330 --> 46:56.970
It's probably the most embarrassing few paragraphs of the book.

46:58.090 --> 47:02.330
On the other hand, there's a panel read, sent to do it by D.G. Compton.

47:03.930 --> 47:04.890
Yes, yes.

47:04.890 --> 47:11.030
It's about sexuality and sexuality in particular.

47:11.990 --> 47:12.630
From what little?

47:13.050 --> 47:15.870
A short story of a fiducian poem called Dane Pia.

47:17.370 --> 47:20.290
From what I've read of Compton, which isn't very much,

47:20.310 --> 47:24.810
it seemed to me that he always liked to make sex appear dirty,

47:25.190 --> 47:28.830
and something that should be hidden away.

47:28.830 --> 47:32.770
But he liked to make it appear dirty and something that you feel revolved with.

47:34.210 --> 47:35.650
Well, perhaps he...

47:35.650 --> 47:39.050
We carry with people that have talked about some kind of theological dirt,

47:39.530 --> 47:41.030
and that's what's left of him, in the book.

47:41.730 --> 47:46.850
That Compton was very good at doing characterization with people.

47:47.590 --> 47:50.610
And it seems very real, and that's why many people do it.

47:52.050 --> 47:53.690
That's definitely kind of a bad thing.

47:54.310 --> 47:55.890
Well, that has many people.

47:57.610 --> 48:01.130
Perhaps it appeared to me that his character is just a peer-dirty nun of him.

48:01.630 --> 48:03.410
I wouldn't be friends with any old ones.

48:03.510 --> 48:04.110
I really existed.

48:06.030 --> 48:08.530
I say one more thing, particularly with Sister Joy.

48:09.090 --> 48:14.750
The whole point of the novel is that the female narrator,

48:15.830 --> 48:19.150
who's very brave now, does feel this way.

48:19.150 --> 48:24.170
And if you follow it, it's for sure that rather than underage,

48:24.290 --> 48:29.170
on the other hand, there's lots of jolly good sex in chronicles.

48:29.730 --> 48:32.650
Well, you just, you know, if you fancy someone, you can just say,

48:32.850 --> 48:34.670
how about it, and all together,

48:35.950 --> 48:39.470
things dirty or nasty in chronicles,

48:39.690 --> 48:42.170
that's tremendously moving sequence,

48:42.170 --> 48:45.370
and the great Zarka, who being up forcibly,

48:46.110 --> 48:49.290
makes love to the late-night question,

48:49.970 --> 48:51.370
I suppose, is that a right thing?

48:51.370 --> 48:53.050
No, it's the one I was thinking of, actually.

48:53.410 --> 48:57.770
Yes, well, as I said, there is a distinction between aggressive,

48:58.150 --> 48:59.710
love-making, and rape.

49:00.470 --> 49:02.490
It's a very subtle one sometimes in fiction.

49:04.750 --> 49:07.330
I've had that particular scene extremely moving,

49:07.330 --> 49:11.070
very much of the characters, certainly not dirty,

49:11.330 --> 49:15.490
and nasty, I wanted to give that subject.

49:16.390 --> 49:19.350
But maybe I'm doing it wrong, but...

49:19.350 --> 49:20.010
Yes.

49:21.650 --> 49:26.750
I'm sure as speaking of putting the spirited on tape,

49:26.910 --> 49:28.970
there's a good eight-pater-back of a few years ago.

49:29.110 --> 49:31.430
I think there was a big ball of wax, wasn't it,

49:32.230 --> 49:35.330
where they feed sort of signals directly into the brain,

49:35.330 --> 49:37.150
and they sort of bypassing the whole problem,

49:37.330 --> 49:44.350
and sort of direct sort of effects in the head as it is.

49:44.510 --> 49:46.390
It was all in the imagination anyway, I think.

49:47.690 --> 49:49.310
All these sort of perversions, you know.

49:50.050 --> 49:52.910
That's right, the Fred Paul one, you know.

49:55.170 --> 49:57.330
I reckon, for reasons like,

49:58.050 --> 49:59.390
I've come down to the north of it,

49:59.390 --> 50:01.610
but it's kind of a sort of, you know,

50:01.830 --> 50:04.410
like, a great method of that.

50:04.590 --> 50:05.150
Which way?

50:06.370 --> 50:07.670
The four-fold left.

50:10.850 --> 50:11.330
Um...

50:11.330 --> 50:13.230
There was a great variety of curves.

50:14.050 --> 50:15.370
I know the focus.

50:16.070 --> 50:17.930
You know, one in that, I think,

50:18.470 --> 50:24.390
is very much an extra...

50:24.390 --> 50:27.390
a movie-ass system, so...

50:31.210 --> 50:31.850
so...

50:31.850 --> 50:33.390
so, um...

50:33.990 --> 50:37.390
so, I reckon, I would say...

50:37.390 --> 50:40.570
the piece has a really large theme,

50:41.250 --> 50:43.490
which is the big thing.

50:44.270 --> 50:45.770
Yeah, well, it's a sort of...

50:45.770 --> 50:46.190
Call of telepathy.

50:48.750 --> 50:50.190
No more of most music.

50:51.410 --> 50:53.630
Quite literally, there are all sorts of possibilities.

50:54.070 --> 50:55.730
It's just up to the guy's imagination.

50:56.010 --> 50:58.270
They can do anything, but it's all in the brain, isn't it?

50:59.110 --> 51:02.650
I was sort of giving him sexual experiences from his child,

51:02.790 --> 51:04.530
but then there was a...

51:04.530 --> 51:07.170
some very effective sex themes in that book, actually.

51:08.570 --> 51:10.050
I sort of...

51:10.050 --> 51:10.310
Yeah.

51:10.850 --> 51:13.130
I was wondering, what they do to the sick

51:13.130 --> 51:16.050
in long-term good, the iron dream.

51:16.550 --> 51:17.310
Oh, yeah.

51:19.870 --> 51:21.650
Ah, but there is no excuse of the sick.

51:21.850 --> 51:23.730
Non-dial has the whole thing in...

51:23.730 --> 51:25.530
Yeah, I was just grand, so he took it from me.

51:25.810 --> 51:26.950
Glad it's here, sick.

51:28.010 --> 51:29.490
You read too much of that afterwards.

51:30.790 --> 51:33.050
Well, Michael Morkock describes his sort of...

51:33.570 --> 51:34.470
sort of... sort of...

51:34.470 --> 51:35.330
sort of a sort of sexual novel, isn't it?

51:35.430 --> 51:38.370
There's no excuse of that, really.

51:38.990 --> 51:41.170
But it's in a diffugetry, and...

51:41.170 --> 51:41.810
all his...

51:41.810 --> 51:43.690
So, there's one more thing,

51:43.690 --> 51:44.610
which we...

51:45.370 --> 51:48.070
described in just a very long, nice, of love.

51:48.390 --> 51:49.850
We thought, in the...

51:49.850 --> 51:53.030
people had, you know, dead reactions they played over the years,

51:54.030 --> 51:55.870
but all he was trying to transform

51:55.870 --> 51:57.110
the coin was to Morkock,

51:57.250 --> 51:58.270
because I'll hear more about that.

51:58.850 --> 52:01.130
But with...

52:01.590 --> 52:03.150
reproduced in a surrealistic fashion,

52:04.250 --> 52:07.090
we're feeling that...

52:07.810 --> 52:08.290
with...

52:08.290 --> 52:09.910
you know, a multi-dialogical.

52:09.910 --> 52:11.190
Which book was it?

52:12.150 --> 52:13.910
Probably the early...

52:15.530 --> 52:16.350
Stornbringer books.

52:17.650 --> 52:18.090
Second...

52:18.090 --> 52:18.910
which isn't the second one.

52:20.570 --> 52:21.270
The Book of Souls.

52:23.090 --> 52:24.810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

52:25.410 --> 52:26.730
The Bible, the sexual imagery.

52:27.790 --> 52:29.810
You know, there's explicit sex,

52:30.010 --> 52:31.970
and there's also...

52:31.970 --> 52:32.830
stuff with the Bible,

52:33.070 --> 52:33.990
all the sort of things that...

52:34.470 --> 52:35.950
there's no normal secret.

52:36.390 --> 52:39.890
Of course, Behold the Man, there was the...

52:39.890 --> 52:41.890
sex and that realistic sex of the...

52:42.410 --> 52:44.190
character masturbating with Cholbun,

52:44.470 --> 52:46.550
and who goes back, you know, three times.

52:47.690 --> 52:48.810
Uh, there's...

52:48.810 --> 52:49.010
are...

52:50.770 --> 52:51.330
there's...

52:52.690 --> 52:53.250
explicit...

52:53.250 --> 52:53.770
sex and...

52:53.770 --> 52:53.930
what?

52:56.970 --> 52:58.850
There's no normal sex.

52:59.050 --> 52:59.310
Yeah.

53:00.530 --> 53:02.350
Well, page.

53:04.150 --> 53:06.090
Actually, yeah, I was just talking about

53:06.090 --> 53:07.890
symbolical sex. What about the...

53:07.890 --> 53:09.450
story in... I think it was...

53:09.450 --> 53:11.990
Quark number two, where the preparation of one...

53:11.990 --> 53:13.630
to love it for... dinner.

53:14.770 --> 53:15.030
Yeah.

53:15.230 --> 53:17.090
Which is a, you know, nice love story.

53:17.710 --> 53:18.870
Which the...

53:19.850 --> 53:21.810
the young woman is told

53:21.810 --> 53:23.450
how to prepare...

53:23.450 --> 53:25.010
her boyfriend for the...

53:25.010 --> 53:26.970
supper. Sort of... drinking.

53:28.770 --> 53:29.370
Really?

53:30.290 --> 53:31.210
Really, yeah.

53:31.610 --> 53:31.870
Yeah.

53:32.950 --> 53:33.550
Yeah.

53:33.550 --> 53:35.290
Of course.

53:35.870 --> 53:38.050
Uh, do you think in 2001,

53:38.310 --> 53:40.250
there's sexual pleasure around being taught

53:40.250 --> 53:41.050
by a black woman?

53:42.190 --> 53:42.670
Yeah.

53:43.430 --> 53:45.490
I don't know, but don't talk to that like me

53:45.490 --> 53:46.090
or fly away.

53:49.850 --> 53:50.330
I'm...

53:52.610 --> 53:53.090
I'm...

53:53.090 --> 53:53.970
something I'll...

53:53.970 --> 53:55.890
assume for...

53:55.890 --> 53:57.730
about sex and fantasy,

53:57.970 --> 53:59.370
you seem to have read my fantasy.

54:00.010 --> 54:01.930
I guess it's more...

54:01.930 --> 54:04.310
the stress in that science fiction. You haven't got all the gadgets.

54:04.530 --> 54:06.030
Science fiction can get you to help you along.

54:06.290 --> 54:06.950
Yeah, I don't know.

54:07.810 --> 54:09.650
You can say what you think.

54:09.770 --> 54:11.590
You think Conan's sex life is.

54:12.610 --> 54:13.510
Yeah, I don't know.

54:14.430 --> 54:16.030
He's always seems to be having...

54:16.030 --> 54:17.230
he never seems to get in.

54:17.530 --> 54:18.010
You know?

54:18.890 --> 54:21.550
He rides off into the sun set with...

54:21.550 --> 54:24.070
Maiden under one arm and his horse between his legs

54:24.070 --> 54:24.870
and that's the face.

54:28.130 --> 54:29.730
He never seems to really get in.

54:29.730 --> 54:31.230
We're listening to a fave

54:31.230 --> 54:32.830
hanging around with six strong men.

54:33.450 --> 54:34.210
What do you reckon, Pasha?

54:37.090 --> 54:37.530
Hmm?

54:42.850 --> 54:43.990
Like in the...

54:43.990 --> 54:45.730
very large ones, there is...

54:46.650 --> 54:47.910
You mean, you know,

54:48.370 --> 54:49.530
he meets a girl

54:49.530 --> 54:50.950
and he takes her up to a bedroom,

54:51.130 --> 54:52.430
then you get dot, dot, dot,

54:53.010 --> 54:53.910
then it's the next day.

54:54.130 --> 54:56.570
I mean, surely there's an old point about sex

54:56.570 --> 54:58.530
and his sex and fantasy writing.

54:59.190 --> 55:00.710
I think it's...

55:00.710 --> 55:01.850
you know, similar to the...

55:01.850 --> 55:04.810
the interest in violence

55:05.690 --> 55:06.530
in...

55:06.530 --> 55:07.770
vampirism

55:08.170 --> 55:10.990
and horror films in general.

55:12.150 --> 55:15.050
And it doesn't even matter

55:15.050 --> 55:16.570
if the fantasy novel really...

55:17.090 --> 55:18.170
er...hero

55:18.170 --> 55:20.750
lay as a heroine because the whole story

55:20.750 --> 55:22.150
is filled with

55:22.150 --> 55:23.170
sexually

55:24.450 --> 55:26.070
and therefore satisfying experiences

55:26.070 --> 55:27.350
on an abstract plane.

55:27.530 --> 55:28.970
I mean, fantasy

55:28.970 --> 55:31.770
is essentially an unusual sex.

55:32.570 --> 55:33.770
Not just an unusual

55:33.770 --> 55:35.670
explicit sex, it's a steal.

55:36.590 --> 55:38.610
I mean, in the case of the show,

55:38.710 --> 55:40.090
if they want a read a novel

55:40.090 --> 55:41.650
that's explicitly sexual,

55:41.970 --> 55:43.470
they can go over with any of the

55:43.470 --> 55:45.710
popular sex novels in the show.

55:47.370 --> 55:49.310
But being sexist,

55:49.510 --> 55:49.990
the mind

55:51.070 --> 55:52.230
of the sort of the source result

55:52.230 --> 55:53.790
in particular seems to me

55:53.790 --> 55:56.070
the very simplistic

55:56.950 --> 55:57.830
sexual nature

55:58.470 --> 55:59.490
of the injury.

56:00.150 --> 56:02.930
I mean, we're looking at massive sores, you know.

56:03.110 --> 56:04.650
I've never had a sex with two guys

56:04.650 --> 56:05.950
come to the shop and buy

56:05.950 --> 56:06.730
sort of the source result.

56:08.810 --> 56:10.990
You know, it just seems to be a lie.

56:11.330 --> 56:12.310
It will get

56:13.110 --> 56:14.230
kicked out of

56:14.230 --> 56:15.350
sort of the source result

56:15.350 --> 56:18.330
of the fantasy and vampire horror films.

56:21.850 --> 56:22.450
You mean

56:22.450 --> 56:24.070
to sexually read the little guys

56:24.070 --> 56:24.970
like big sores?

56:25.870 --> 56:26.190
Well,

56:27.190 --> 56:28.810
don't they just like the big muscles?

56:29.770 --> 56:32.130
Are they feeling inadequate and all that sort of thing?

56:32.550 --> 56:34.290
No, I don't think it's matter of feeling inadequate.

56:34.750 --> 56:35.230
You know,

56:35.350 --> 56:37.150
it's just that they like reading

56:37.150 --> 56:38.810
the sort of things because perhaps

56:40.110 --> 56:41.170
it's still sexual.

56:41.930 --> 56:43.570
The sores of fellow symbols.

56:43.910 --> 56:45.330
How many years have you been playing for?

56:45.490 --> 56:49.970
I've been playing for this guy.

56:49.970 --> 56:52.210
You've got a lesbian vampire.

56:52.450 --> 56:53.730
They're becoming much more explicit.

56:54.090 --> 56:56.050
And I fully expect

56:56.050 --> 56:57.990
that some of the sort of three

56:58.490 --> 56:58.970
novels

56:59.990 --> 57:01.990
will basically become more explicit.

57:02.250 --> 57:04.010
I'm trying to set a new Elbrich novel

57:04.010 --> 57:05.250
that is explicit.

57:06.370 --> 57:07.310
Why is it explicit?

57:07.870 --> 57:09.490
Well, it's just that you said the business start

57:09.490 --> 57:12.030
and it's that you can't make out the crack

57:12.030 --> 57:15.230
in the case of the women in those traditions.

57:15.670 --> 57:16.170
I'm sorry.

57:16.610 --> 57:17.910
They made a lot of changes.

57:19.550 --> 57:20.090
So,

57:20.290 --> 57:21.050
the three novels

57:21.050 --> 57:22.030
are good.

57:22.310 --> 57:25.110
They, he went out and he hacked about the time.

57:25.630 --> 57:28.130
The whole point of the three novels.

57:29.830 --> 57:30.450
That's it.

57:45.410 --> 57:46.650
You've got a record.

57:47.690 --> 57:48.170
Yeah.

57:49.330 --> 57:50.130
No, I can't.

57:52.070 --> 57:53.710
Everybody goes and they fix it.

57:53.890 --> 57:55.850
The reason Tom and Sagan there is a very

57:55.850 --> 57:56.730
valid reason

57:56.730 --> 57:58.950
for being

57:59.770 --> 58:00.630
in horror films.

58:00.890 --> 58:03.430
I think that's an experience thing.

58:03.690 --> 58:05.830
Why horror films so popular with young girls?

58:07.250 --> 58:07.590
Well,

58:07.990 --> 58:09.910
they said what was very much real,

58:10.490 --> 58:11.370
that was witchcraft.

58:13.210 --> 58:13.970
I'll let you go.

58:14.070 --> 58:16.230
I mean, the immediate possibility

58:16.230 --> 58:17.350
of the range

58:17.350 --> 58:19.710
of witchcraft

58:19.710 --> 58:20.970
was there for a thousand times.

58:23.090 --> 58:23.950
We can have

58:23.950 --> 58:25.210
a lot of great pictures here.

58:25.450 --> 58:27.530
But they all had to turn to the top on their own.

58:28.790 --> 58:29.310
And

58:29.730 --> 58:31.270
the older girls over 20

58:31.270 --> 58:32.770
can certainly have any

58:32.770 --> 58:35.090
nearest-most feelings for witchcraft.

58:35.270 --> 58:37.210
They get more of

58:37.850 --> 58:38.610
a more steady

58:39.190 --> 58:40.690
factory life, astrology

58:41.510 --> 58:43.910
and terror and stuff like that.

58:45.350 --> 58:48.070
But I think it's very interesting that very young

58:48.730 --> 58:49.250
girls

58:49.930 --> 58:51.690
read the three novels

58:51.690 --> 58:53.750
and vampire novels

58:53.750 --> 58:55.010
and horror to get

58:55.010 --> 58:57.750
the pants to get onto the ones

58:57.750 --> 58:58.150
to pose.

59:00.110 --> 59:01.870
Since we're running out of time

59:01.870 --> 59:03.630
I think we'll keep moving along and reach

59:03.630 --> 59:04.470
a good climax.

59:07.310 --> 59:08.670
You want to say something cool?

59:09.770 --> 59:10.250
Yes?

59:11.070 --> 59:11.550
Since

59:12.150 --> 59:13.290
when you mentioned

59:13.910 --> 59:16.250
that, where Kinder is from the young girls,

59:16.790 --> 59:17.510
what do you think

59:17.510 --> 59:17.970
has been

59:19.570 --> 59:20.210
the adult

59:20.210 --> 59:22.110
history of sexualization

59:22.110 --> 59:22.690
around

59:23.410 --> 59:26.110
in the short stories

59:26.110 --> 59:27.590
and in the heart of the world?

59:28.470 --> 59:29.110
Oh, um,

59:30.070 --> 59:32.230
actually, if anyone's

59:32.230 --> 59:34.150
read an anthology, I think it's

59:34.150 --> 59:35.650
a thing in my eye or something,

59:35.850 --> 59:37.570
there's a very good short story in there

59:37.570 --> 59:40.090
with the building of numerous sex situations.

59:42.610 --> 59:44.210
There are all sorts of bizarre

59:44.210 --> 59:45.870
bisexual relationships

59:45.870 --> 59:48.010
occurring between the hero and the aliens.

59:48.690 --> 59:49.970
Unfortunately, I haven't got a book here

59:49.970 --> 59:51.030
so I can't read any of it out.

59:53.550 --> 59:55.830
That's sort of rather good, but then again

59:55.830 --> 59:57.910
his novel, I think it's

59:57.910 --> 59:58.890
when Harley was one,

59:59.530 --> 01:00:01.830
it contained some very bad sex relations.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:03.930
Sort of almost as bad

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:05.190
as probably worse than Silverberg,

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:08.070
but since it's one of his first novels

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:09.750
I guess it's excusable to say.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:11.830
Yeah,

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:13.310
he hasn't even got any photos of it.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.190
Yeah, and it's Paul's,

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:17.330
there's just sort of a pop in Halfway 2

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:19.670
and they're totally hero about it, you know.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:21.910
With Harley

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.190
having his crisis, you know.

01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:25.610
All of his name is

01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:27.870
often bed with the doctors and that.

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:28.850
Does your gene

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.050
not allow, I sort of briefly in the shop

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:33.630
about a computer that makes you a female?

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.090
I've only seen the cover,

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:37.310
I doubt it wasn't about that.

01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:38.590
So, how do you think

01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:41.070
there's a future for this

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:43.230
title of fiction, you know,

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:44.510
machine, computer,

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:46.590
given all together?

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:48.650
In this new Heinlein novel

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:50.950
the female computer

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:52.790
marries Lazarus Long

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:55.050
and becomes

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.890
a clone, the consciousness of the computer.

01:00:58.210 --> 01:00:59.670
Clones with a body

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:01.270
which is forced, bed and ground

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:02.510
and marries the hero.

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:04.870
So it's in love with the computer.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.470
And then there's a computer in

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:09.090
one of Heinlein's

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:10.770
moon is a harsh mistress which has

01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:12.990
an orgasm when it sees half the earth's liner.

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:17.470
Oh no, it's been bed and ground.

01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:18.690
Computer?

01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.430
Yeah.

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:22.230
It changes at all the blocks

01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:24.230
that's why it changes in this.

01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:24.550
True.

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.750
True, you've got it.

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:30.270
I thought it was a thing that's a tool.

01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:32.290
Could it be a health

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:33.070
or a success?

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.910
Yeah, health 900 in

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:37.290
2001

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:40.070
his voice is very ambiguous

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.970
in that.

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:43.030
What's the difference?

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:43.730
Health?

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:46.810
Well, I think it's

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:48.770
a bit ambiguous to say it's ambiguous.

01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:51.730
I thought it was a different

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:52.770
state of the art.

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:54.930
It was very later because he had

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:56.050
only warm wood

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:57.690
in the film.

01:01:58.830 --> 01:01:59.690
He was

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:01.070
recorded

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:03.750
double GV's above

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:05.930
in two human actions.

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.550
So he always came across

01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:08.590
an enormous presence.

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.550
I don't know if it's

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:13.890
an extremely asexual voice, but it's ambiguous.

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.010
I think both the astronauts

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.570
they were

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:19.390
pretty asexual to me.

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:20.510
Yeah, it's not the whole environment.

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:23.750
Actually the computer in Barbarello

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:24.570
was much more interesting

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:26.350
than the relationship

01:02:26.350 --> 01:02:27.170
with Barbarello.

01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:29.610
You mean

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.430
how it rapes the machine?

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:32.930
Oh, that's the thing.

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:35.650
It is an instance.

01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:37.670
Sort of a hazard of the sexual organ.

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:39.610
It's a giant rule.

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.990
Anyone?

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:45.590
That's an example of sex in the SF film

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:46.130
they did in there.

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:49.890
Anyone like to hazard a guess as to

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:52.110
what form sex will take in future SF?

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:53.430
You think

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:54.290
because

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:57.930
more explicit sex scenes are

01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:58.730
allowable now,

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.550
writers all

01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:03.910
tend to include explicit sex scenes

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:04.590
in their books

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:07.310
and shy away from the

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:09.590
unusual sex.

01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:12.110
It's a sort of

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:13.950
one hazard in that

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:15.790
they're going to use more explicit sex and not use

01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:16.530
so much imagination.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.470
I just sort of become more pornographic

01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:21.110
and rather than more unusual

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.190
sex scenes.

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:24.910
He says it's

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:25.870
full farmers books.

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:28.510
The ones that's written for SF are much better

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:30.230
than

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:33.510
what he'd written

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.750
when he was just writing SF

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:36.930
at time stopping.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:38.370
It's certainly more amazing

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:39.070
and more

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:41.490
erasing and

01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:43.710
well, you know,

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.630
I guess it's a bit below that.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.250
Now I think that

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:48.330
certainly

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:51.750
when farmer porn stops out at any

01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:53.370
fiction like the River World

01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:55.810
I think we really let those head of his go.

01:03:56.350 --> 01:03:56.790
Well

01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:59.330
I don't think anybody's encroaching

01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:01.450
in sexual imagination.

01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:03.810
What do you mean a little snake in the womb?

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:04.550
That sort of thing

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:07.210
that lives in the womb of a young lady?

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.670
No, there's a whole

01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:12.070
sexual terror

01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:14.190
with sexual issues

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:15.670
and that means

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:17.950
to truly terrify

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:18.290
it.

01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:21.650
It has never been done in science fiction

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:22.350
in that way.

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:25.790
The relationship

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:27.670
really turns into a walk

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:29.590
when the guy's taking over the turnaround

01:04:29.590 --> 01:04:31.390
and I think that's what it is.

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:33.990
I thought the bit was the

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:35.950
iron teeth from the guy

01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:36.570
that was a bit true.

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:37.830
That killed everybody.

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:39.290
It's definitely the first chapter

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:41.550
of the story.

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:43.650
And that terrifying line

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:45.190
that's made up of the CLT

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:46.890
so there's this line where

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:48.210
he was a snake

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.690
and when the guy was tripping in

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:51.530
and he was on for a play

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:53.250
and he was about to sort of finish the job

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:55.610
he was like, he warped with this snake.

01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:56.450
And

01:04:56.450 --> 01:05:00.870
this snake is

01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:01.970
trying to do the cry.

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:04.630
That's the movement.

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:07.590
Any part

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:07.990
of the story?

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.290
Do you see that as a possible area

01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:13.130
which science fiction may develop

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:14.270
more along that lines

01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:17.930
than as straight science fiction?

01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:21.310
We're just going to talk about

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:22.430
the point as it goes

01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:23.110
to business.

01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:25.770
But certainly

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:28.650
if science fiction is made

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:30.270
any name for itself

01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:33.310
as a magic of literature

01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.290
at most point is

01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:36.530
bringing into you

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:37.850
a civil history

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:40.770
sexual relationships to the most per se

01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:42.430
old-fashioned

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:44.230
language which had nothing

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:46.930
to evade some kind of a story.

01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:48.830
If you're going to

01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:50.430
write about the snake

01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:52.090
or have a traditional taste of it

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.790
we all have it in the book.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.570
But if you can't do it, imagine it

01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:56.950
differently.

01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:59.530
I don't know.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:02.150
I think you just invent

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:04.130
another tradition.

01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:06.450
But if the sexual

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.510
relationship of the creatures

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:09.410
are explored

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:12.390
they probably do not

01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:13.770
like karma.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.690
No, it's like a window.

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:17.950
You know, this is the most killing.

01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:20.410
But over there, here I just think

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:21.790
you're Christ if you're going to write

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:23.950
some of it through and expect it to be

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:25.510
part of the science fiction culture.

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:28.170
I'll bring up his friend and have

01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:29.630
the computer and talk about it.

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:30.110
I'll bring it up.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:36.830
I think we can close then.

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:40.190
Well, if no one has anything else to say.

01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:41.490
Well, there is a lot of

01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:42.970
rhetoric that we didn't touch on.

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.730
I think that film has been used

01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:47.290
the sort of situation that you have there.

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:49.490
We get population pressure on the police

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:51.730
which is sort of a moratorium

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:53.670
on this.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.970
I think it was 30 years.

01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:58.110
I prefer the

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:00.230
TX1138 film to that one.

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.350
The way?

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.930
TX1138.

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:04.830
It's a similar sort of film.

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:07.910
A situation like that

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:09.130
would never exist because

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:11.450
any government would try to force it

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:13.870
if it's a democratic government would be out on their neck.

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:16.390
What kind of democratic government?

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:18.110
I might just...

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.250
I might just...

01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:22.430
I might expect that if you give

01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:24.170
democratic government to the century.

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:27.050
Tendon century?

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:31.250
Can you name one?

01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:36.890
Australia.

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:38.190
Australia?

01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:41.170
We probably ought to

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:42.370
see it pretty hard.

01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:46.510
I think the government is

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:47.110
tending towards

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:50.350
being more non-democratic and that's politics.

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:54.210
I think we better sort of close this panel

01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:54.970
now too.

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:56.690
Oh, gee, just when we get started.

01:07:58.110 --> 01:07:58.470
I'll

01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:01.010
remind people at 3.30 there's a talk by

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.870
Dr Peter Dullin.

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.910
Thanks.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:07.190
Don't swear at money, just

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.470
compromise.

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:12.350
Who's

01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:14.030
lecturer in psychology

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:15.930
at Adelaide University and who's going to speak

01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:17.170
on the subject of

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:18.530
science fiction in the occult.

01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:20.290
So, I'll just

01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:21.510
leave it to him.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:24.630
Well,

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.730
I've been

01:08:27.730 --> 01:08:29.930
a long time reader of

01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:30.710
science fiction

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:33.990
possibly

01:08:35.190 --> 01:08:37.710
for about 25 years now.

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.050
I've been absorbing

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:40.230
this particular brew.

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:42.150
I've also been

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:44.850
on the fringes of

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:46.990
psychological research for around about the same

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:48.150
period of time.

01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:52.630
And I think that this

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.890
twin set of certain

01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:56.890
circumstances seem to get some feedback.

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:00.750
This twin set of

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:03.090
circumstances should have led me long before

01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:04.870
now to start

01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:06.010
to put the two together.

01:09:06.610 --> 01:09:08.990
Certainly in fact being invited to speak to you

01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:10.970
today that led me to wonder

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:12.930
whether there was any connection between the two

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:13.490
interests.

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:17.670
It may be thought to be

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:20.570
insulting perhaps

01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:22.030
to suggest the sorts of

01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:23.610
interests that lead people

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.150
or the sorts of people

01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:28.450
that are interested in

01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:30.470
science fiction are likely to be

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.430
the sorts of people who are interested in the occult.

01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:33.970
Because we all know

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.990
some very odd sorts of people who are interested in the occult.

01:09:38.190 --> 01:09:39.510
I see no evidence

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:41.290
looking around me that

01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:44.250
there are very odd people interested in science fiction.

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:47.850
And certainly some of the oddest

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:48.590
of the people

01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:51.590
that I've known

01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:52.890
who have been interested in

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:54.750
the occult have been

01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:57.830
or profess themselves interested in science fiction

01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:59.050
but usually if the R.L.

01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:00.230
fan thought variety.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:02.970
And not of the

01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:05.870
after-clark

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:07.970
or even John Windham

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:08.930
variety.

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:14.990
That's one sort of connection however.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.370
And I suppose that

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:19.170
a generous way of putting it

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:21.650
is that the sort of people who are interested in the occult

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:23.110
and the sort of people

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:24.550
who are interested in science fiction

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:26.070
are both likely to

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:27.570
also be

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:33.050
oriented towards the idea

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:34.730
of the universe being a rich

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.230
and wonderful place

01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:38.930
in which many extraordinary things can happen.

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:42.810
But there are of course other

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:45.010
ways in which science fiction

01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:47.650
and the occult are connected.

01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:49.850
For instance there are a tremendous number

01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:51.990
of science fiction novels

01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:53.550
and stories

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:54.750
which

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:58.030
either have occult themes

01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:59.510
or refer to the occult.

01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:03.610
Now I think that if you look at the way

01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:05.250
in which science fiction

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:06.450
refers to the occult

01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:08.430
some very interesting things emerge.

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:12.410
There seem to be

01:11:13.090 --> 01:11:15.450
obviously because science fiction is such

01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:17.090
a mixed

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:18.350
kind of

01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:19.690
genre

01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:23.350
a number of different

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:25.270
sorts of use of the occult

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:26.290
in science fiction

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.710
in the straight fantasy

01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:31.130
situation obviously

01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:32.950
it's a dream mechanism

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:34.170
or something of that kind.

01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:37.390
You can just throw it in to enable things to

01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:39.050
happen that couldn't otherwise happen.

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:43.250
However, and

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:44.330
given this

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:47.370
I don't think there's an enormous

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.830
amount of point in

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:51.830
saying a lot about it on the fantasy side

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:53.350
although it might be worthy

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:55.250
of note that one theme

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:56.910
that very frequently turns up

01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:59.610
in fantasy which uses

01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:01.330
the occult as part of its

01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:02.390
material

01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:04.110
that

01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:07.390
there seems very often to be

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:09.010
accepted by the author

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:10.730
and presumably therefore by the reader

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:12.610
that there's some sort of opposition

01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:14.510
between regulation science

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:16.690
and the occult

01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:19.350
thus in books like

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:21.130
for instance The Incomplete Enchanter

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:24.790
which I think one of the most delightful

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:26.810
works actually in any area of

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:27.870
science fiction I've read

01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:30.810
but that clearly

01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:32.050
was a sort of fantasy

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:34.690
but one of the striking points was

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:36.710
that where magic works

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:37.750
but science didn't

01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:40.030
that is

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:42.470
the person could do

01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:44.270
remarkable things by reciting

01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:46.230
formulae but his matches wouldn't work

01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:50.130
and I think that's very significant

01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:52.970
but we'll return to that later

01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:56.310
but to look at the more regulation

01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:58.030
science fiction are

01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:59.410
I suppose the more

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:02.270
science extension

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:04.310
sort of science fiction

01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:06.430
there where the occult is

01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:07.210
referred to

01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:09.630
very seldom is

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:12.390
it left in the condition

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:14.590
in which it is in our everyday world

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.350
in the attitudes of people

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:18.090
in real life today

01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:20.490
that is there are very few

01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:22.550
science fiction books

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:23.570
which refer to

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:26.290
ESP or any such

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:26.870
theme

01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:30.250
or any occult theme

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:33.030
while at the same time

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:35.910
giving much

01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:37.770
credence to the

01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:39.420
common view

01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:41.320
to the among intellectuals

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:43.430
anyway of skepticism

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:45.710
the only one

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:46.690
that springs to mind

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:48.030
at once

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.250
as a contradiction of what I've just said

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:52.030
is

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.570
Hoyle's black cloud where

01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:56.790
the rather absurd Russian

01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:57.670
scientist

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.770
I think had some very hard words

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:01.430
to say

01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:04.230
about people believing in ghosts

01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:05.430
and this kind of thing

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:08.530
but then he said some very silly things anyway

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:10.650
and not a character

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:11.570
to be taken seriously

01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:14.050
indeed I don't believe that any of Hoyle's characters

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:15.410
are characters to be taken seriously

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:18.750
but leaving that aside

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:20.390
most people have either

01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:21.130
ignored

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:23.610
the occult completely

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:26.070
or their world of the future

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:28.070
or their possible world or whatever it is

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:29.710
has accepted

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:32.850
psychic events

01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:34.790
as being fairly normal

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:36.250
sorts of things that just happen

01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:41.070
even in something like

01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:42.390
John Wyndham's chrysalids

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:44.270
where clearly

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.870
telepathy was something

01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:48.870
which most people

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:50.070
didn't

01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:52.290
expect to happen

01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:55.070
it wasn't because it was unbelievable

01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:56.670
but it was

01:14:58.330 --> 01:14:59.430
precise as speak

01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:00.510
it was because it was different

01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:02.570
there was no suggestion that there was anything

01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:03.830
unlikely about it

01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.910
now

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:08.250
on the other side

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.030
of the

01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:11.570
ballpark

01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:14.810
we have the real life situation

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.750
that

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.650
there are a tremendous number of people

01:15:18.650 --> 01:15:20.850
and highly intelligent

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.450
highly educated people

01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:23.970
who are very very skeptical

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:25.590
about

01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:27.510
ESP

01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:30.090
I suspect most of these cannot be science fiction

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:31.690
readers or writers

01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:33.890
if you

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:36.770
leave it the last time I've just been making

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:40.270
so there is a perhaps an interesting observation

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:42.410
the sort of people that display

01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:45.130
the most typical scientific skepticism

01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:46.730
about the occult today

01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:48.350
are not members

01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:50.390
of our confraternity

01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.830
now

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:54.750
this business of skepticism

01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:56.370
is

01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:57.970
I think the oddest phenomenon

01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.830
of all in the occult field

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:02.150
and

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:04.530
I've

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:05.870
in fact

01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:07.470
devoted some

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.790
attention as a psychologist

01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:11.930
it's been something I've been interested in

01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:13.790
in the phenomena

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:15.410
of skepticism

01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:18.790
and one of the things which is very striking

01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:19.590
is

01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:22.470
the way in which skepticism

01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:24.850
alters your appreciation of evidence

01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:29.210
why is the atmosphere so different

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.810
or what is it that's so different

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:35.170
about the attitude to ESP

01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:36.950
in science fiction even among people

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:39.430
that don't in the writing science fiction books

01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.670
make ESP a central theme

01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:43.330
or ESP or the occult

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:44.030
for that matter

01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:47.730
well

01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:50.350
when you look at for instance the chrysalids

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:52.550
what's so weird and wonderful

01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:54.970
about the phenomenon that's being talked about

01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:56.570
all it appears to be

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:57.990
is that certain individuals

01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:59.070
have got a built-in radio

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:02.690
there's nothing terribly astonishing about it

01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:04.210
they have perhaps

01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:06.290
an unfair advantage over the rest of humanity

01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:08.170
in that they can communicate with each other

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.570
over considerable distances

01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:11.890
without using apparatus and so on

01:17:11.890 --> 01:17:13.110
but there's nothing

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:16.430
particularly odd about it

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:17.850
it's just something that happens

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:23.490
similarly I suppose

01:17:23.490 --> 01:17:26.070
even in the incomplete enchanter with magic

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.850
again

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:29.670
the magic is a pretty casual kind of thing

01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:32.610
pretty ordinary it's just another kind of technology

01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:34.090
it happens to be

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:36.450
as I've suggested in this particular case

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:38.750
postulated that it's inconsistent

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:40.990
with the other sort of technology

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:42.890
the techno technology

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.270
but it's a very ordinary

01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:46.290
very everyday

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.850
the

01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:51.170
attitude

01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:53.470
of skepticism which the

01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:56.110
scientific man in the street

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:58.050
appears to have

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:00.030
towards the occult

01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:01.270
in other words

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.830
generates some of the oddity of the phenomenon

01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:04.850
itself

01:18:06.130 --> 01:18:08.250
ESP is hard to prove

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.490
not because it's a

01:18:09.490 --> 01:18:11.230
weird, intractable phenomenon

01:18:11.230 --> 01:18:13.390
but because people don't believe in it

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:17.310
and I think that one can

01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:18.930
illustrate this fairly well by imagining

01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:20.970
what would happen if one did live

01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:22.690
in one of the science fiction worlds

01:18:22.690 --> 01:18:24.510
in which I've suggested there are many

01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:25.590
even among people

01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:29.110
the worlds created by writers who are not themselves

01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:30.450
writing about ESP

01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:32.810
in which ESP

01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:35.590
or magic for that matter are facts of life

01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:37.870
if somebody

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:41.130
is supposed to be

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:42.870
a psi person

01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:45.430
and they claim

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:48.170
to have got some information from somebody else's mind

01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:49.910
the answer is oh yes

01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:50.950
well you know

01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.230
we must stop this happening or we will

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:55.310
we must make use of this ability

01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:56.430
or something like this

01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:58.570
now in the

01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:00.650
skeptics world

01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:02.830
the result

01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:05.310
the immediate question is

01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:08.050
how can I know that you've got it from his mind

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.190
now just imagine if you came

01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:13.270
up to somebody in the morning and you said

01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:14.710
um

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:17.190
I hear that

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:18.690
there

01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:22.170
was a terrible air crash last night

01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:24.950
I think it was in the Lebanon

01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:27.190
and the chap says

01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:28.070
how do you know

01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:31.150
and you said well I heard it on the radio

01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:32.650
hmm

01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:34.470
expect me to believe that

01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:36.610
prove it

01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:39.250
and you try to prove for instance

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:41.790
that you didn't see a newspaper lying across the back of a chair

01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:43.130
as you walked

01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:45.290
after you were sitting in the room this morning

01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:46.590
or that

01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:49.530
but you didn't get it by ESP

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:53.130
it would be a pretty

01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:54.670
intractable sort of task

01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:57.790
the fact is the difficulties of the situation

01:19:57.790 --> 01:20:00.270
are created by the skeptics attitude

01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:01.370
now

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:05.070
I am becoming sort of paranoid about these skeptics

01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.750
because

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:08.350
and I may say before I go any further

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:10.170
I am not by any means convinced

01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:12.870
of all aspects of the evidence about

01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:14.270
ESP and so on

01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:15.670
I just don't know

01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:17.730
I'm very much a fenced sitter

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.770
but it seems to me that the skeptics

01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:22.790
are behaving very peculiarly

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:23.750
um

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:25.130
in fact

01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:28.870
there are plenty of phenomena

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:30.310
that are just as unrepeatable

01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:33.010
just as difficult to control of the ESP

01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:34.170
from their claim to be

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:35.810
and

01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:38.350
I have the impression that in this field

01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:40.910
and indeed in a number of other fields

01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:44.650
the skeptic

01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:47.310
and it's not only skeptics that are sort of seeing a minute

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:48.770
is in fact

01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:51.170
creating ghosts for itself to chase

01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:56.330
that in fact he is

01:20:57.150 --> 01:20:58.690
making the thing seem a

01:20:58.690 --> 01:21:01.170
darn sight more mysterious than it need be

01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:05.130
I say it's not only skeptic system

01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:05.850
because I think

01:21:05.850 --> 01:21:08.170
that I see similar symptoms

01:21:08.170 --> 01:21:11.030
in certain other areas of activity

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.410
I was at a paper the other day

01:21:14.410 --> 01:21:17.250
given by Professor JC Smart

01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:20.610
who used to be the head of the philosophy department

01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:23.030
at Adelaide

01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:25.790
and he was talking about

01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:27.270
modal logic

01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:30.030
in fact his paper was entitled

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:31.210
possible worlds

01:21:31.210 --> 01:21:33.530
which sounds like a good science fictiony sort of title

01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:34.890
and that's one of the reasons I went

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.750
the other reason I went is a Jack

01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:37.690
very good friend of mine

01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:39.450
but um

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.870
I expected to hear something fairly gutsy

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.530
about ideas of possibility

01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:47.110
what I actually got was a feverish attack

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:48.310
on modal logic

01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:51.630
and why was modal logic being attacked

01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:53.130
because

01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:56.290
in Jack Smart's analysis of it

01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:59.710
it looked as if he was going to have to believe

01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:01.930
if he wanted to use modal logic

01:22:01.930 --> 01:22:04.510
in the simultaneous existence

01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:06.650
of an infinite number of

01:22:06.650 --> 01:22:08.770
possible worlds in which different things

01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:09.530
happened

01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:11.910
and so that when

01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:14.670
in modal logic

01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:16.750
the analysis of for instance

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:19.130
the statement

01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:21.630
if I Ron Barassi had imported

01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:24.170
a few West Australians I would have won

01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:27.330
involved in fact in

01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:28.870
phishing a

01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:31.490
possible world in which Ron Barassi

01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:33.550
actually did import lots of Australians

01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:34.670
and win

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.950
or lots of West Australians and win

01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:38.610
now

01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:43.370
my view is that in this particular instance

01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:46.030
Jack Smart was in fact

01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:48.470
creating a ghost

01:22:49.810 --> 01:22:52.050
there was no philosophical

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.170
validity in his belief that it was

01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:55.710
necessary to actually believe

01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:58.170
in these possible worlds in order to

01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:59.110
use modal logic

01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:02.330
now both Jack Smart

01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:03.870
and a number of other philosophers

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:06.430
similarly in the area

01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:08.190
of the problem of mind

01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:13.130
um appear to be on a crusade against

01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:15.150
what in fact Jack calls

01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:16.170
ghost stuff

01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:19.050
um that is the stuff

01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:20.490
of which mind is made up

01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:23.230
he's desperately anxious to avoid a philosophical

01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:25.050
position which involves him

01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:27.210
in believing in some

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:29.030
mysterious mental substance

01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:30.990
in fact

01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:33.170
I believe it's perfectly possible to get by

01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:35.210
without this mysterious mental substance

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:37.090
but it seems to me the interesting thing

01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:39.270
about his position on these

01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:40.250
different topics

01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:43.130
is that he's creating a

01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:45.750
situation of mystery in order not to believe in it

01:23:47.130 --> 01:23:48.990
um but in fact the philosophical

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:50.970
argument which say that there is a mystery

01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:53.090
a weakling philosophical arguments

01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:55.110
for the position out of which he's

01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:56.990
generating the mystery now go back

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.030
to the ESP

01:23:58.970 --> 01:24:01.270
who was it that made ESP

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:02.110
so mysterious

01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:04.870
well it is true that

01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:06.050
J.B. Rein

01:24:06.690 --> 01:24:08.890
started the ball rolling himself by

01:24:09.530 --> 01:24:11.130
taking a sort of

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:12.290
mysterious materialist line

01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:14.990
but let's face it that's just J.B. Rein

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.110
there's nothing in the phenomena

01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:18.490
which has this weird

01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:20.210
uh

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:22.030
ghostly

01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:24.210
uh implication

01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:27.010
all that the phenomena say is that

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:29.250
some dear robber is getting some information and we don't know

01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:30.610
how the hell the heck they got it

01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:32.710
there's nothing mysterious or

01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:34.390
ghostly about that

01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:36.270
and

01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:39.390
when you look at the evidence

01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:41.870
that for instance ESP doesn't obey

01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:43.570
the laws of ordinary science

01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:45.470
what you find is that that

01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:46.790
evidence is very weak

01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:49.630
very much weaker than the

01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:51.790
evidence that ESP occurs for instance

01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:54.830
now look at the skeptics argument

01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:57.190
I've often found myself arguing with the skeptic

01:24:57.190 --> 01:24:58.490
who's saying something like

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:00.150
um

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.950
well ESP can't occur

01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:04.790
because

01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:07.750
those evidence that suggests it doesn't

01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:09.150
obey the inverse square law

01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:11.270
and anything

01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:13.410
which involves radiation from points

01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:15.830
got to obey that well then you look at the evidence

01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:17.410
that ESP doesn't obey the

01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:19.770
inverse square law and that evidence

01:25:19.770 --> 01:25:20.610
is rotten

01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:23.610
in fact the evidence that ESP doesn't obey

01:25:23.610 --> 01:25:27.750
the inverse square law is about as strong as the evidence that radio doesn't obey the inverse square law

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:29.370
so

01:25:30.690 --> 01:25:32.130
what's happening is rather like

01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:33.870
somebody saying stands to reason

01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:35.830
there can't be any unicorns because there wouldn't

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.470
be enough young virgins to go around

01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.510
well

01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:42.310
this

01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:44.710
is again I think a beautiful example

01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:46.050
of people creating the ghosts

01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:47.310
that they're not going to believe in

01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:50.590
the fact is that nothing quite knows

01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:52.530
where science ends and the occult

01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:53.470
takes over

01:25:54.930 --> 01:25:55.450
um

01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:58.090
there may be people

01:25:58.090 --> 01:26:00.030
around and I suspect

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:02.250
with Jack's Mart I'm being very nasty

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:03.830
to Dave

01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:05.050
for no particular reason

01:26:05.710 --> 01:26:06.010
um

01:26:07.570 --> 01:26:09.590
but there are people who really believe

01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:11.990
that most of the basic concepts of science

01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:13.170
are there

01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:15.190
laid out ready for our use

01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:17.830
that there's nothing big and new

01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:18.590
to be discovered

01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:21.130
now this seems to me

01:26:21.850 --> 01:26:22.750
to be

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:25.030
and that is that really

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:27.910
that there are no whole fields of new forces

01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:29.590
and new sets of laws

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:32.910
which enable things to relate together very differently

01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:35.650
from the way they appear to the net

01:26:35.650 --> 01:26:36.670
um

01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:39.710
and it seems to me this is a very unlikely

01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:41.030
state of affairs

01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:43.250
and it's a very unlikely state of affairs

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:44.350
for a number of reasons

01:26:45.130 --> 01:26:46.050
one is

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:48.370
simply that

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:51.290
when you look at all the basic concepts

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:53.870
on which science, scientific thinking

01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:55.810
is based today

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:56.750
you find

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:59.450
that you only have to think for about

01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:01.250
three minutes to generate a paradox

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.610
whether you talk about time

01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:06.350
whether you talk about cause

01:27:07.190 --> 01:27:07.550
uh

01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:09.090
whether you talk about

01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:11.850
even I suppose

01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:13.490
a relevance which are

01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:15.970
a concept which lies

01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:18.030
behind science very strongly

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:19.890
where most scientists don't notice it

01:27:19.890 --> 01:27:21.730
all of these things

01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:23.590
generate paradoxes very easily

01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:24.870
and

01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:26.290
Bertrand Russell

01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:28.890
among many other philosophers

01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:31.990
pointed out that whenever you come across a paradox

01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:34.210
it's about time to be doing some

01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:36.250
philosophizing something is going wrong

01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:37.990
there's something wrong with your basic concepts

01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:42.310
um well this being so

01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:44.070
there's room for

01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:46.310
an immense amount of reshuffling

01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:48.030
of our basic concepts in science

01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:50.230
who knows what

01:27:50.230 --> 01:27:52.710
when the reshuffling takes place

01:27:52.710 --> 01:27:54.450
will appear to be obvious

01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:56.810
which appears to be impossible now

01:27:57.930 --> 01:28:00.050
who knows what new forces

01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:01.530
there is room for

01:28:01.530 --> 01:28:03.270
or new relationships

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:06.610
I certainly wouldn't be so bold as to make any guesses

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.310
meanwhile we have claims

01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:12.410
that there are phenomenon

01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:14.670
um

01:28:14.670 --> 01:28:16.850
it's claimed that some people

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:20.090
do obtain information from others

01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:21.630
which information

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:23.090
it seems very difficult

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:24.130
to

01:28:24.130 --> 01:28:28.110
see as being transmitted by any of the means we know

01:28:28.110 --> 01:28:30.330
the true in transmitting information

01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:32.350
um

01:28:33.630 --> 01:28:34.850
on the face with

01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:37.830
not a very astounding sort of claim

01:28:39.490 --> 01:28:40.170
uh

01:28:40.170 --> 01:28:42.450
it is true that

01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:45.130
when you try to

01:28:45.130 --> 01:28:46.770
prove these claims

01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:49.350
you run up against difficulties

01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:52.310
you run up against difficulties

01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:55.110
though only because the standards of evidence

01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:57.090
for which you're being required to

01:28:58.330 --> 01:28:59.010
uh

01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:00.170
reach

01:29:01.330 --> 01:29:03.630
are being determined by the skeptics

01:29:05.410 --> 01:29:06.550
in fact

01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:10.090
most of the experiments that someone like

01:29:10.090 --> 01:29:13.110
in ESP for instance that someone like Mark Hansel

01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:14.770
dismisses

01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:17.430
would be in most branches of science

01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:19.450
regarded as pretty watertight experiments

01:29:22.450 --> 01:29:24.110
after all Mark Hansel

01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:26.830
in order to discredit an ESP experiment

01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:27.910
only has to show

01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:30.450
that there's some way in which somebody could have cheated

01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:33.090
including the experimenter

01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:35.630
or including if necessary all five experimenters

01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:39.410
now what branch of science

01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.710
of regulation science could stand up to this

01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:46.830
how many physics experiments do we know

01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:50.850
that have been carried out under conditions where this sort of cheating has been ruled out

01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:54.750
doesn't very often happen

01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:59.370
in fact a lot of physics experiments including some of the very simplest ones

01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:02.670
not only could cheating have been carried out

01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:04.310
a lot of the time but there's plenty of

01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:06.550
of contrary evidence

01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:08.790
to take experiments

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:11.210
very simple experiment that

01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:13.750
that used to be done regularly at school

01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:15.910
and in my school anyway

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:19.490
of showing that you can put ice in the bottom of a boiling tube

01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:21.890
and boil the water at the top without melting the ice

01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:25.390
I remember having a very revealing experience one day

01:30:25.390 --> 01:30:27.390
of coming in after that lesson

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:29.470
and finding

01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:32.770
neatly wrapped up in the piece of wire gauze

01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:36.290
in which we had thought that these visor-beam plates

01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:40.350
nine nips the boiling tube on the desk

01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:42.050
was in fact a piece of glass

01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:45.410
and it's clear that our

01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:48.410
science teacher hadn't been that confident

01:30:50.490 --> 01:30:52.310
and had put one over on us

01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.790
now

01:30:54.010 --> 01:30:56.210
in fact he was well aware

01:30:56.210 --> 01:31:00.510
that the odds were quite high that if he tried this experiment himself it wouldn't work

01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:01.410
and indeed

01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:06.410
for every once that a scientist has repeated most of the simple scientific experiments

01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:12.110
thousands of school teachers and school children have repeated them and got the opposite results

01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:14.610
but who takes that into account

01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:17.930
I would hardly say the evidence however was consistent

01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:27.530
the fact is that the standards of evidence are determined by the level of preparedness to believe

01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:31.650
of the people who are the actual critics and judges of those experiments

01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:39.390
so we have a situation where we have a phenomenon which on the face of it doesn't seem

01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:43.670
in my view or set a phenomenon which on the face of it doesn't seem in my view

01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:46.490
or that intrinsically unlikely

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:54.030
and a set of people who are controlling the levels of belief in the scientific community

01:31:54.610 --> 01:32:02.550
who are influencing on all levels the response to the data

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:08.710
now the science fiction writers of course

01:32:09.610 --> 01:32:11.930
writing of future worlds

01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:17.350
are not looking at it from the point of view of the scientific skeptic

01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:20.910
they're saying let's envisage a future world

01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:24.930
in which we set our adventure or whatever it may be

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:35.250
well one of the things that might have happened in this future world is that ESP has become accepted

01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:40.370
and as soon as it becomes accepted there it is a perfectly ordinary part of life

01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:47.770
it may have its problems, it may have a need for new legislation, indeed it almost certainly will

01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:51.750
but it doesn't look very odd in that context at all

01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:58.210
now one concept which I think that the scientists really ought to get hold of in fact

01:32:59.010 --> 01:33:02.730
or one notion that they really ought to get hold of which I think is a very important one

01:33:02.730 --> 01:33:06.050
which all that I've been saying illustrates to be important

01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:12.810
is this notion that the process of setting a priori probabilities on events

01:33:14.050 --> 01:33:17.590
is not a part of science as yet

01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:26.050
we have innumerable techniques for assessing evidence in certain fixed contexts

01:33:27.170 --> 01:33:29.510
for designing experiments

01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:38.210
for reasoning out with some traumatic exceptions

01:33:38.210 --> 01:33:40.390
what are the consequences of theories

01:33:41.050 --> 01:33:43.450
what should be the prediction of theories

01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:48.750
what we do not have is any scientific techniques for setting a priori probabilities

01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:55.070
these are set by nothing more nor less than the atmosphere in the scientific community

01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:58.390
and every now and then this leads to quite bizarre results

01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:03.550
in 1915, Vagan had put forward his theory of continental drift

01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:09.010
which was entirely consistent with the evidence then available

01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:17.830
it was a reasonably right today's stance and it was a sane sounding theory

01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:25.350
that you had a layer of rock which was actually not quite as solid over long periods of time

01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:31.410
as it appeared to be over the short periods of time that we have contact with it

01:34:32.210 --> 01:34:39.850
and that the consonants were floating on this soft layer and moving other bits of rock were floating and moving around

01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:47.130
and it traced out the ways in which outlines of various bits of the map

01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:51.230
as it is now would have fitted together

01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:53.970
or very reasonable

01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:58.930
in fact this theory was created by the scientific community with complete score

01:34:59.710 --> 01:35:02.130
for some reason which I can't quite tie down

01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:04.790
it seemed to be just basically unlikely

01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:10.130
and for many years Vagan's theory was just a scientific curiosity

01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:14.050
now there's enough called Vagan who put forward this theory

01:35:14.050 --> 01:35:19.410
and weirdly the consonants almost look as if it might be right

01:35:20.190 --> 01:35:22.790
though of course its nonsense was the attitude

01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:28.170
now of course we can measure in inches per year how much the consonants are drifting

01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:37.530
but as I say there's a very good example of completely capricious assignment of apriori probabilities

01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:40.070
like ESP

01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:46.410
and it's the capricious assignment of apriori probabilities to phenomena like ESP

01:35:46.410 --> 01:35:50.550
that creates the experimental difficulty in showing that it occurs

01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:58.650
and let's say the science fiction writer's use of the concept as an everyday one illustrates very well

01:35:58.650 --> 01:36:05.790
but this is the case as soon as you think in terms of a world in which ESP is not regarded as extraordinary

01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:07.630
then it really well isn't extraordinary

01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:11.070
that's all we're listed with

01:36:12.810 --> 01:36:20.790
really there are other areas in ESP and a cult doesn't just mean ESP

01:36:23.130 --> 01:36:27.370
phenomena like ghosts for instance mixing with the occult

01:36:27.370 --> 01:36:30.270
as indeed I suppose phenomena like demons

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:33.670
of course a demon phenomenon

01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:42.070
but and these of course also have been treated by science fiction writers

01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:54.470
although by and large demons and straight magic tend to be dealt with in the fantasy category

01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:57.990
rather than in the straight science fiction category

01:36:57.990 --> 01:37:03.970
I think there are probably one or two of Shekly's things that might be regarded as science fiction

01:37:03.970 --> 01:37:08.310
as opposed to fantasy which dealt with the year after and so on

01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:11.250
immortality ink is that much Shekly's

01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:16.430
I think that's probably science fiction just not from fantasy

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:24.870
but as I said by and large these are fantasy

01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:32.430
and one of the reasons they tend to be fantasy I think is because as soon as you start dealing with magic per se

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:38.870
you start getting this thing about the about its opposition to science coming in

01:37:40.450 --> 01:37:47.850
as soon as you start saying or as soon as science fiction writers start saying for instance

01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:51.830
you can get this done by muttering this formula

01:37:52.650 --> 01:37:58.050
or by making up a little poem or something

01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:07.330
then you're dealing in a world which is I suppose sufficiently different from the everyday one we're used to

01:38:07.330 --> 01:38:11.470
that you feel like postulating some other great differences

01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:16.650
and you're very conscious of the fact that you're dealing with the abnormal

01:38:16.650 --> 01:38:28.490
and then I think this being so you're now able to get a kind of anti-science bias

01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:37.970
if you like in your thinking and to exaggerate all of the things which go with magic

01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:40.930
including its distinction from science

01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:49.650
and the other thing I suppose is that I myself for instance would assign very low priorities

01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:58.270
at April I probably have aprioride probabilities to controlling the world by muttering formulae

01:38:58.270 --> 01:39:03.790
certainly want to do a muttering formulae but things like making water boil and this kind of thing

01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:11.150
I would on the whole things rather unlikely although I stand open to be convinced

01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:20.230
and this being so the person who puts these things into his story must be aware

01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:28.070
that he's standing up against the whole background of today's technological thinking

01:39:30.090 --> 01:39:35.610
and he might just as well do the whole whole thing and say technology doesn't work here

01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:40.210
we work on this other pattern instead

01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:52.510
so that's what happens with that now with the afterlife concept I think something else happens

01:39:53.330 --> 01:39:59.210
I think we tend to become here when we operate the science section producers

01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:10.450
be dazzled with the notion of a separate occult the notion of ghost stuff

01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:17.110
as it's very difficult to talk about actual ghosts without thinking in terms of ghost stuff

01:40:17.110 --> 01:40:21.030
it's easy for me to say of ESP that doesn't involve ghost stuff

01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:24.850
of the mind that doesn't involve ghost stuff

01:40:24.850 --> 01:40:31.450
when I come to talk about ghosts there seems to be something a bit strange about saying that doesn't involve ghost stuff

01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:36.650
but on the other hand I don't think this is necessarily so

01:40:36.650 --> 01:40:46.130
it seems to me that again there's nothing in principle inconsistent with any science that we have

01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:55.370
of the idea that a being by existing as a living being in this world has effects

01:40:55.370 --> 01:41:03.270
on some physical aspect of his environment which affects the cyst which affects continue to act

01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:07.910
the whole system is so darn complex

01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:19.590
I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that something akin to personality can still exist in these effects

01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:24.990
in the complex of effects that we have on our environment

01:41:26.490 --> 01:41:28.630
I'm not spilling this forward as a theory

01:41:28.630 --> 01:41:35.930
I'm merely saying that theories along these sorts of lines don't seem to me to be ruled without a chord

01:41:35.930 --> 01:41:40.590
by the current position of science

01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:44.330
furthermore suppose they were

01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:54.630
suppose the idea of the afterlife or any of the phenomena associated with ghosts and so on

01:41:56.590 --> 01:42:01.150
were to involve principles that science has not yet thought of

01:42:02.250 --> 01:42:06.770
under what circumstances would these become occult principles

01:42:08.610 --> 01:42:13.470
I've already suggested there's room in science for a whole lot of new principles

01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:18.810
there's room for whole new sets of forces, whole new sets of relationships

01:42:20.150 --> 01:42:31.690
now if we're forced to agree that afterlives involve these new sets of principles, new sets of forces

01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:33.670
that we haven't yet envisaged

01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:43.550
so be it, but does it follow that these things will be unincorporable in science

01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:48.630
nothing about what I've said so far in any way suggests this

01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:55.310
now this I think brings me back to Jack Smart and his ghost hunting

01:42:57.590 --> 01:43:07.050
here he is saying I must avoid any theory of the mind and the body which involves the mind as ghost stuff

01:43:08.970 --> 01:43:11.550
but when does the ghost stuff become ghost stuff?

01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:19.010
what does it have to do? well what it has to do is to refuse to be incorporated in the general body of knowledge

01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:21.110
in a consistent kind of way

01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:28.810
but there's nothing about simply being a kind of stuff we haven't yet identified that tells one that it has this peculiar property

01:43:31.530 --> 01:43:36.750
now either Jack is saying there is no more to be found out

01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:44.970
there are no grand new principles even if somebody okay may find some small sort of radiation we haven't thought of

01:43:44.970 --> 01:43:47.350
but nothing big, nothing that really matters

01:43:48.250 --> 01:43:55.370
either he's saying this and since it's obvious that mind is going to be outside

01:43:55.370 --> 01:44:00.270
any of the forces and materials that we know of now

01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:02.990
that automatically makes mind ghost stuff

01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:09.030
or I would have thought he would have to say

01:44:10.710 --> 01:44:18.650
well okay if you find your new forces, if you find your new sorts of scientific interaction

01:44:20.010 --> 01:44:23.270
then mind stuff gets incorporated in science

01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:27.130
and it's not ghost stuff anymore

01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:34.210
as I say what applies to mind stuff I see no reason shouldn't apply to ghost stuff

01:44:34.210 --> 01:44:36.130
I've no particular reason to think it does

01:44:36.130 --> 01:44:42.730
I don't think the evidence for ghosts is frightfully hard as things are going

01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:48.990
I don't think the evidence that sometimes when people sit down to guess cards something funny happens

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:51.630
is quite strong

01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:57.030
if we're to believe some of the reports emanating from Russia

01:44:58.070 --> 01:45:02.110
it's more than just speculation there's some big things happening

01:45:02.110 --> 01:45:11.010
unfortunately these reports don't usually come with clear information as to how to obtain similar phenomena ourselves

01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:19.590
and I think when you get lots of indirect reports of phenomena like this

01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:24.590
and no part of data on how to repeat the experiments and this kind of thing

01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:27.590
then you're quite right to be suspicious

01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:36.370
and I myself am slightly suspicious for instance I actually remember in animal science fiction etc

01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:44.510
a few days ago I came across a copy which had an article about some of the Russian stuff

01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:51.870
and talking about this woman who apparently can actually move objects by psychokinesis

01:45:54.090 --> 01:46:03.130
and as if it was just perfectly ordinary thing that she was being studied in a laboratory with a zoological apparatus and so on

01:46:03.130 --> 01:46:08.890
and sure if this is happening then forget about all the probability stuff

01:46:08.890 --> 01:46:16.410
all the card guessing and attempts to get six to come up more often than chance when rolling dice

01:46:16.410 --> 01:46:19.150
here we've got real solid phenomena

01:46:19.690 --> 01:46:25.430
but unfortunately the world keeps coming across these reports as I say nobody gives clear details

01:46:26.150 --> 01:46:30.930
on exactly how we go about trying to find the same thing here

01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:36.370
and until they do I think I'm going to remain suspicious

01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:44.970
I would be suspicious I suppose if a colleague in my own area of psychology

01:46:45.630 --> 01:46:50.390
kept writing me letters about how he was getting marvelous results on his new theory

01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:52.450
but never actually described his experiments

01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:57.230
I wonder why he didn't

01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:04.750
and he never published any papers in which the experiment was clearly written up

01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:08.650
so that's where I'm being suspicious

01:47:08.650 --> 01:47:12.450
but leaving aside those perhaps overhoed reports

01:47:12.450 --> 01:47:19.990
nevertheless it seems to me there are sufficient funny things happening in the ESP research area

01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:25.450
to make one feel that it all can't be explained by

01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:34.190
fakery, bad statistics and this sort of thing

01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:41.330
whether what is happening actually is some sort of communication

01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:46.470
I'm somewhat hesitant about

01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:50.450
it seems to me that the vast majority of ESP experiments are set up

01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:55.610
in such a way that anything statistically abnormal what happens is going to look like communication

01:47:58.310 --> 01:48:03.490
and it might just be the statistical things are happening which don't look like communication

01:48:03.490 --> 01:48:05.910
which we're not dissecting out

01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:13.290
I mean if you set somebody to guess cards and somebody else to try to transmit them

01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:17.830
then you tend to look for various kinds of relationships between the guesses and the targets

01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:21.470
sure it looks like one person is sending a message to the other person

01:48:23.210 --> 01:48:30.170
but what if you found for instance that when a person tried to guess a pack of cards

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:36.990
there was statistically unlikely relationship between the sequence of guesses they produced

01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:42.290
and the sequence of targets you would produce by taking the actual target sequence

01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:45.370
reversing it and moving forward ahead

01:48:46.210 --> 01:48:48.050
that wouldn't look so much like communication

01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:51.570
and then you'd simply say something statistically odd is happening

01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:56.690
we're just selecting out the communication like statistically odd things look like

01:48:58.030 --> 01:49:01.390
now the other thing I think is of course that

01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:08.610
there's a lot of when we come across for instance ESP or individuals with PSI

01:49:08.610 --> 01:49:11.690
in books by E.C. Tarden the sort of person

01:49:13.210 --> 01:49:21.590
ESP again looks very different from what it looks like in the everyday reports we get of it

01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:36.350
the E.C. Tarden and for that matter John Wyndham's PSI phenomena are very much like using an internal telephone

01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:51.050
the Telsey Amburton sort of PSI phenomena are like a new kind of mental engineering I suppose

01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:57.450
you fiddle around with things by carrying out some sort of mental manipulation which you can only imagine

01:49:57.450 --> 01:50:02.270
if you happen to be Telsey Amburton or someone like that which theoretically anybody can

01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:11.270
or most people could to some degree but it's a kind of engineering and curiously

01:50:12.230 --> 01:50:21.370
uninvolved kind of operation now the real life ESP phenomena accounts fall into two categories

01:50:21.370 --> 01:50:29.510
which are both very unlike this they're either the card guessing ones in which a current situation

01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:33.350
in which the person who's doing it usually doesn't seem to know when he's doing it

01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:36.650
that is he can't tell his good guesses from his bad guesses

01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:45.290
and where there seems to be no special feel attached to the experience at all

01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:49.970
except perhaps a feeling of pride if he hasn't got so many right on something of this kind

01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:56.190
the other kind of everyday report is of a spontaneous flash phenomenon

01:50:58.410 --> 01:51:06.310
which usually is highly emotionally charged which doesn't seem to be turn onable at will

01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:16.710
and which when I say it's emotionally charged it feels special in that the person says

01:51:16.710 --> 01:51:21.050
you know I haven't dreamed last night which was so extraordinary I really must tell you about it

01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:27.710
I'm sure it means something I had the most the funniest feeling this morning they say

01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:33.510
or something of this kind but also of course the topics emotionally charged normally

01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:39.770
in that you know it's usually about Fred falling under a bus or something equally exciting

01:51:40.770 --> 01:51:50.610
so with the two kind the ESP card guessing experiment type the spontaneous emotional communication type

01:51:50.610 --> 01:51:55.370
and these are both different from the sort you get in ESP stories

01:51:55.370 --> 01:52:01.330
which is the casual communication or casual mental engineering type

01:52:03.050 --> 01:52:08.550
and I think that science fiction is developing a set of conventions in other words

01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:15.850
about psychic phenomena which are quite different from what probably the psychic phenomena if they exist are like

01:52:17.170 --> 01:52:19.470
this has happened in other fields too

01:52:20.530 --> 01:52:26.090
happens all the time if you read if you watch television you'll find there's a whole set of conventions

01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:34.210
about what mental illness is alike which are all things that go with films

01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:40.630
as whole set of conventions of course in detective stories but what murderers are like

01:52:40.630 --> 01:52:44.650
what detectives are like for that matter which have little relationship to real life

01:52:44.650 --> 01:52:47.450
we know what the rules are within the particular field

01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:53.370
now I think in the ESP field science fiction writers are in danger of creating a set of conventions

01:52:53.370 --> 01:52:58.170
as to what the accounts like or what particularly what Psy is like

01:52:58.170 --> 01:53:04.270
which bear little relation to real life Psy assuming there is such a beast

01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:13.690
and perhaps it's early enough in ESP for a corrective to be in science fiction

01:53:13.690 --> 01:53:17.530
for a corrective to be administered though I rather doubt it

01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:30.690
nobody as yet I think has really taken off in their science fiction writing from what we know about ESP for instance

01:53:30.690 --> 01:53:40.670
and incorporated that in a realistic style story in future situation

01:53:42.190 --> 01:53:53.550
but anyway to sum up there are a number of ways in which the account and science fiction intersect

01:53:56.290 --> 01:54:02.350
they intersect through the common interest of the science fiction reader and writer

01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:10.490
and the occultist in the universe being a rather less boring place than it is for the ordinary person

01:54:11.590 --> 01:54:26.110
they intersect in that the science fiction writer illustrates for us the effect of in real life

01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:36.710
of our attitudes to the occult on the evidential situation on what we need

01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:52.170
if we are to believe in these phenomena and they intersect in that I suppose they show something about

01:54:52.170 --> 01:55:06.290
the way in which our ideas about particular phenomena can be conventionalised within a particular medium

01:55:07.170 --> 01:55:16.650
in such a way that they cease to bear any relationship with the real phenomena as they occur in real life

01:55:18.090 --> 01:55:20.230
well I think that's all I have to say

01:55:21.630 --> 01:55:29.450
I'd be very happy if anyone would use to raise any questions or give us any illustrations

01:55:35.490 --> 01:55:36.050
yes

01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:47.010
Doctor, can I ask you if there is a specific on some of the novels, if there are novels that you've written, such as The Star, and the First Age,

01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:52.610
how can you compare some of the things that you've written that are written by us?

01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:57.310
well I'm very bad at titles and authors

01:55:59.390 --> 01:56:03.190
I think it would be like to know that you've written anything that I haven't written, it's fairly small

01:56:03.610 --> 01:56:05.170
can I run down the check for a second?

01:56:05.250 --> 01:56:06.810
yes indeed, yes indeed

01:56:07.370 --> 01:56:11.090
going back to you, yes, thanks for being quite there for a second

01:56:16.130 --> 01:56:23.570
the stories where he wrote about the people voluntary discorporation

01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:29.690
and relishing their spirit into a sort of parallel world

01:56:29.690 --> 01:56:35.550
and they were still contactable by or able to contact people living in this world

01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:37.550
with new materials

01:56:38.590 --> 01:56:45.930
you've written that, there's a type of project that is sort of an old story

01:56:46.970 --> 01:56:56.250
and then of course there was Frank Lerner, the genius of the community

01:56:56.250 --> 01:56:59.490
he called it like a pre-cognition

01:56:59.490 --> 01:57:01.950
pre-cognition, yes, he's a pre-coach

01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:13.050
and the latest one that Frank Lerner has written about the idea of the British would be the God-makers

01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:17.810
I have read it perhaps, I might remember what it was about

01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:27.390
the God-makers, there's a priesthood of the experts inside

01:57:28.890 --> 01:57:29.490
yeah

01:57:29.490 --> 01:57:35.410
recently got that eventually they can start a diorama and there's a picture on the map

01:57:35.410 --> 01:57:37.390
and then having a picture on the camera

01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:43.690
and the announcement of the discovery is good

01:57:43.690 --> 01:57:48.050
across the classic years of style in the believable sense is good

01:57:48.050 --> 01:57:49.850
is good, is good, might not smith

01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:51.230
yes, yes

01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:54.190
I'm not sure, I don't believe it

01:57:54.190 --> 01:57:58.230
I'm referring to the Class 3 analogy for ideological interference

01:57:59.150 --> 01:58:07.310
the luck changer, when they produced this girl was a luck changer

01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:12.310
and when she was pregnant she changed their business to be a luck

01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:19.330
and somehow or other the pilot of her ship connected her up to a physical amplify

01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:25.710
and brought her to the slug chance for the entire planet

01:58:26.330 --> 01:58:29.210
because everything went so bad, Frank Lerner thought so

01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:37.270
who's the chap who has the dog brain and what not

01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:39.890
always has a presided communication officer

01:58:40.570 --> 01:58:41.850
a janitor, yes

01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:44.290
then of course the thing

01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:47.230
I was just thinking, that's the opposite way around

01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:51.630
then of course the structural film, the healthy energy stories

01:58:52.230 --> 01:58:55.570
which have no relation to anything real whatsoever

01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:58.490
and no cross-ethnic connection to anything real

01:58:59.190 --> 01:59:02.990
yes, well now are you sort of

01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:06.890
are you trying to

01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:11.330
question what I'm saying

01:59:13.890 --> 01:59:19.330
I'm trying to say that science fiction basically is telling stories

01:59:19.330 --> 01:59:20.630
that people want to read

01:59:21.330 --> 01:59:24.030
and that I agree with you completely

01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:28.790
that reality is very boring

01:59:29.090 --> 01:59:30.630
most of the time

01:59:31.330 --> 01:59:34.070
and again, I mean in the book, we're creating

01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:38.270
we're going to have to say

01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:41.250
even if it's physical science

01:59:41.250 --> 01:59:44.350
it doesn't have to be necessarily good science

01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:48.750
all it has to be is believable science or time being

01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:51.310
and it's the same with science

01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:54.490
the same with all the varieties of physical science

01:59:54.490 --> 01:59:56.670
there's no difference between science and science

01:59:56.670 --> 01:59:58.170
it doesn't have to be real

01:59:58.170 --> 02:00:00.930
all you have to do is tell a good story

02:00:00.930 --> 02:00:07.110
and there is a difference between science fiction which is based on real

02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:16.610
there's a difference between science fiction which is based on provable, demonstrable science

02:00:16.610 --> 02:00:22.570
and science which cannot possibly be true

02:00:22.570 --> 02:00:25.790
and science which might be true

02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:29.230
if only it could dream up a way of testing it

02:00:30.110 --> 02:00:35.450
I would have thought that a bigger distinction within the thing

02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:36.990
than the ones that you just made

02:00:36.990 --> 02:00:42.430
when you were sort of misting the, you know, might be true, could be true etc

02:00:43.090 --> 02:00:46.110
I would have thought that there was a great gap

02:00:46.110 --> 02:00:50.330
between the science fiction which said

02:00:51.690 --> 02:00:53.530
what if we discovered that

02:00:54.490 --> 02:00:55.990
and went on from there

02:00:57.810 --> 02:01:00.930
to the science fiction which actually starts off by

02:01:00.930 --> 02:01:05.950
said to be denying some of the things that we believe to be true

02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:11.430
and says what if instead of

02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:15.070
the change in the property is based on

02:01:15.070 --> 02:01:19.810
that something quite basically is not there

02:01:19.810 --> 02:01:21.850
or is twisted in some way

02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:25.610
but I think there's still a tendency for conventions

02:01:25.610 --> 02:01:27.230
to arise even here

02:01:27.230 --> 02:01:31.070
science fiction, I somebody rather did produce a dictionary

02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:33.150
of science fiction ease recently didn't they

02:01:33.150 --> 02:01:35.990
in which they had terms like hyperspace

02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:40.750
which are purely science fiction notions

02:01:40.750 --> 02:01:47.810
but ones which are used throughout science fiction

02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:49.690
by different writers in different contexts

02:01:49.690 --> 02:01:55.730
and it is extraordinary how the science fiction convention

02:01:55.730 --> 02:02:00.710
how wide the science fiction convention has developed

02:02:00.710 --> 02:02:03.010
I mean the concept of an alien is in itself

02:02:03.690 --> 02:02:06.130
a rather interesting science fiction concept

02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:10.830
it's sort of an input to develop that way

02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:16.830
yeah but I think it is unfortunate in a way

02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:19.210
I want to say unfortunately obviously

02:02:19.210 --> 02:02:23.790
you know if you say you're writing stuff to entertain people

02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:26.230
and the criteria are people entertained by it

02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:28.870
then who wants to tie it down with rules

02:02:29.530 --> 02:02:32.570
on the other hand I think that it's worth

02:02:33.690 --> 02:02:35.550
I mean there are a lot of people who

02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:39.450
when they read science fiction like to pick

02:02:40.810 --> 02:02:45.770
something of the what would happen if

02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:46.910
it's a different variety

02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:52.830
rather than what is instead of what we have

02:02:52.830 --> 02:02:58.030
so and so where we're denying the world as it is

02:02:58.030 --> 02:03:00.750
and saying what if it isn't different

02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:03.210
and if it was different than this

02:03:04.150 --> 02:03:08.830
and I think that it's a good idea if in these

02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:13.590
what if ones people are aware

02:03:13.590 --> 02:03:17.790
when they're conventions are departing from

02:03:19.670 --> 02:03:24.290
the comparison with the topic which started them off

02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:27.510
so to speak I mean I honestly think that

02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:31.050
by and large if one could get on to the

02:03:31.050 --> 02:03:35.230
television writers who write things about

02:03:35.230 --> 02:03:37.810
mental illness for instance

02:03:38.590 --> 02:03:41.590
and get across to them

02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:45.050
that what they were presenting mental illness as

02:03:46.630 --> 02:03:49.890
was their own convention and nothing to do with mental illness

02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:54.910
you know I think on the whole they'd rather put it right

02:03:54.910 --> 02:03:56.230
before they went any further

02:03:57.070 --> 02:04:00.990
and the fact is they can get away without doing so

02:04:01.530 --> 02:04:04.230
because they've got a watching public that'll watch anything

02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:09.570
but on the whole it'd be nice if their convention matched the facts

02:04:09.570 --> 02:04:10.410
to some degree

02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:12.690
maybe they should hold a convention

02:04:12.690 --> 02:04:14.250
if one could really talk

02:04:15.650 --> 02:04:17.230
that's an interesting thought

02:04:19.210 --> 02:04:23.730
I think the same goes with the logic of what you're like

02:04:23.730 --> 02:04:25.230
stories about the way

02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:30.930
extroversy is being researched today

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:35.450
has been very sort of about

02:04:35.450 --> 02:04:42.750
how to get the kind of score industry back to make it real

02:04:44.130 --> 02:04:45.370
I'm not suggesting

02:04:46.890 --> 02:04:48.890
I don't know how I've got myself into this

02:04:48.890 --> 02:04:51.850
I don't want to make prescriptions for science fiction writers

02:04:54.430 --> 02:04:58.490
I don't even mind if they ignore the conventions

02:04:58.490 --> 02:05:00.730
I just like them to know

02:05:00.730 --> 02:05:04.110
I would just wish that they knew when they were doing so

02:05:04.110 --> 02:05:05.430
and which ones

02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:11.710
and I think that it would be possible for instance

02:05:11.710 --> 02:05:14.670
to write science fiction stories which did use

02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:19.170
our A science fiction story if one was interested in doing it

02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:23.990
which did in fact use a theory of science of ESP

02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:26.970
which was entirely consistent with the data we have now

02:05:26.970 --> 02:05:27.670
for instance

02:05:27.670 --> 02:05:31.110
I think your basic trouble is you can't really expect

02:05:31.110 --> 02:05:34.230
all the people who are writing stories to think of really

02:05:34.230 --> 02:05:38.710
a really good theory that stands out under the people of the initial assault

02:05:38.710 --> 02:05:39.910
every time

02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:48.250
a lot of people get around this by setting up their own private universes

02:05:48.250 --> 02:05:51.210
they don't have to restate all the postulates every time

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:54.150
and in fact Chandler is what is doggy aspects

02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:56.090
in getting around to the other side

02:05:56.090 --> 02:05:57.930
he's not made concepts now

02:05:57.930 --> 02:06:00.530
but he doesn't have to restate that part of his time

02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:02.710
but the fact that he

02:06:04.450 --> 02:06:07.150
maybe this isn't the greatest idea ever

02:06:07.150 --> 02:06:10.910
because he spends a lot of time trying to draw parallels

02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:15.990
between the evolution of the fairy tale world

02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:19.790
and years ago the membership of many of his air crimes

02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:23.590
world now into a future

02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:25.750
many hundreds of times

02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:31.650
people who worked out of the system were evolving

02:06:32.630 --> 02:06:36.250
universes usually found themselves out against the brick wall

02:06:36.250 --> 02:06:38.230
there's one that I might bring up here

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:42.790
that's Marion Midden who's written a whole series of books

02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:44.590
not necessarily about the fairy people

02:06:44.590 --> 02:06:46.830
but about the same evolving issue

02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:49.330
and he brought himself into a corner

02:06:49.330 --> 02:06:52.250
because in one of the later ones he postulated

02:06:53.670 --> 02:06:57.290
somebody who was brave for luck over a decade generation

02:06:57.290 --> 02:07:00.330
the books called Wingwood and it's that something quite different

02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:03.770
one of the minor things is this lucky girl

02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:07.070
but the point was if you can't go on very many more generations

02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:09.330
before you get a lot of very lucky people around

02:07:09.330 --> 02:07:12.150
it's really the rest of us who aren't from that problem

02:07:13.090 --> 02:07:16.590
there was no way out if he stopped writing that particular book

02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:20.990
about four times it was a pretty good area

02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:23.950
to which he could do his very best

02:07:23.950 --> 02:07:27.970
he had several, that's like the closest thing to ESP was

02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:30.230
in his space

02:07:30.230 --> 02:07:33.810
I think what has annoyed me and at the same time

02:07:33.810 --> 02:07:37.890
interested me very much in sound fiction in this particular area

02:07:37.890 --> 02:07:42.810
being in a way what's now analog sound fiction

02:07:42.810 --> 02:07:45.810
clearly the run of John Campbell

02:07:45.810 --> 02:07:49.990
he was well known to have a pretty legend of stories

02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:51.710
that pushed this particular era

02:07:51.710 --> 02:07:56.490
the theory was, I don't know if it's really true

02:07:56.490 --> 02:08:00.330
the theory going around the line is that he wanted to sell a story to Campbell

02:08:00.330 --> 02:08:01.970
he had to bring in ESP somewhere

02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:06.390
and in a way this is bad because it's limited

02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:09.190
some of the people who had other quite bad stories

02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:11.290
would never go around submitting this story

02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:14.530
but he did maybe bring up a few new ideas

02:08:14.530 --> 02:08:17.150
and maybe got a few people outside the field

02:08:17.150 --> 02:08:18.970
and maybe he did bring up a few things about this issue

02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:24.570
this is, I think, certainly that the new editor feels the loyalty

02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:28.570
Campbell is continuing to fill a lot of his directions

02:08:28.570 --> 02:08:32.930
and that he published this article as the Russian exploration

02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:38.250
I wish there was more clear information on Russian stuff

02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:40.370
someone there wants to do that

02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:41.650
thank you

02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:45.070
certainly you didn't spread analog out about that

02:08:45.070 --> 02:08:45.290
thank you

02:08:45.290 --> 02:08:49.050
also back from discovery behind the iron tomb

02:08:49.050 --> 02:08:51.310
Campbell crossed a few things I'm sorry

02:08:51.310 --> 02:08:52.230
that's my end of the story

02:08:52.230 --> 02:08:57.390
the only thing I've come across is a book on witchcraft

02:08:58.610 --> 02:09:02.290
by a gentleman who believes has a distinction of holding

02:09:02.290 --> 02:09:05.590
would first be a witchcraft from one of the American universities

02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:12.550
but that again only refers very peripherally to it

02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:15.670
it doesn't give one the sort of details one would want

02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:20.790
to have one's skepticism knocked down for further

02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:23.570
and it states very broadly that the Americans

02:09:23.570 --> 02:09:27.570
have got great Psi research programs going on

02:09:27.570 --> 02:09:28.970
on a middle free basis as well

02:09:30.070 --> 02:09:33.650
it's a matter of some concern whether they can close the ESP gap

02:09:33.650 --> 02:09:34.750
and all that kind of nonsense

02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:37.330
but no more than that really

02:09:38.070 --> 02:09:42.070
let me understand something about what you're trying to say

02:09:42.070 --> 02:09:45.330
what you're trying to say is that you don't object to people

02:09:45.330 --> 02:09:49.390
about writing about a completely fictitious universe

02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:53.250
or some impossible twist of this universe

02:09:54.710 --> 02:09:57.870
or something completely reversed and interference

02:09:57.870 --> 02:10:00.890
what you're saying is they should know what they do

02:10:00.890 --> 02:10:04.470
and they should know all the time

02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:06.930
and make it obvious in the stories that they know

02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:13.230
how this conflicts with the available realities

02:10:13.230 --> 02:10:15.730
that have been tested at the moment

02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:18.630
well I suppose in a way I'm saying that

02:10:18.630 --> 02:10:20.430
although I wouldn't want to say it quite that strongly

02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:24.470
I mean I don't want to be reminded of three paragraph intervals

02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:26.550
that the guy knows this

02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:29.410
you're saying that so much writing is sloppy

02:10:29.410 --> 02:10:32.010
well partly this yes

02:10:32.010 --> 02:10:34.470
but the other things I'd like to see at least one story

02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:38.830
which does treat with what we do know

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:42.750
and does handle the thing within the evidence

02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:45.450
for instance Nynian Marshall

02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:51.230
sometime ago his philosopher got himself into an argument

02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:56.090
with somebody who said the ESP was just unclear

02:10:56.090 --> 02:10:58.570
you couldn't make a proper scientific law

02:10:58.570 --> 02:10:59.890
relating to ESP

02:11:01.930 --> 02:11:03.970
so he came up with this one

02:11:04.570 --> 02:11:07.810
he said well take the law of gravity

02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:11.730
why can't we have it consistent with the data we've already got

02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:16.610
an ESP law which matches the law of gravity

02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:19.030
it might go something like this

02:11:19.570 --> 02:11:24.630
and this wasn't being put forward as the law of relating to ESP

02:11:24.630 --> 02:11:26.510
but simply as an example of one that might do

02:11:30.070 --> 02:11:32.830
first of all we'll say

02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:34.550
patterns in the universe

02:11:35.410 --> 02:11:37.750
tend to become more similar to one another

02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:44.170
now this is just like objects being attracted to one another

02:11:44.170 --> 02:11:45.670
patterns tend to become more similar

02:11:46.830 --> 02:11:48.630
and they tend to do so

02:11:49.730 --> 02:11:52.730
in proportion as A they are complex

02:11:57.690 --> 02:11:59.850
B they are already similar

02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:05.790
which of course corresponds to objects being attracted

02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:07.290
when they're already closer to one another

02:12:07.290 --> 02:12:09.370
the law of acceleration is similar

02:12:09.370 --> 02:12:17.750
and C there is some quantum type indeterminacy in their makeup

02:12:21.330 --> 02:12:23.570
now the next thing to note

02:12:23.570 --> 02:12:26.070
that is presumably when people have thoughts

02:12:26.070 --> 02:12:27.510
these are very complex patterns

02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:32.150
and there must be some similarity in patterning

02:12:32.150 --> 02:12:34.150
for two people having similar thoughts

02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:42.530
and the human brain is a very very complex organization

02:12:44.330 --> 02:12:49.390
and there is indeed quantum type indeterminacy

02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:51.790
or something very close to it in the firing of neurons

02:12:52.450 --> 02:12:54.450
that is above a certain level of stimulation

02:12:54.450 --> 02:12:56.450
you can't say the neuron will fire

02:12:56.450 --> 02:12:58.790
but you can specify the probability that it's firing

02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:02.990
now in other words

02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:06.570
patterns in human brains will be the things

02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:08.630
in the universe that we know of

02:13:08.630 --> 02:13:10.470
that will be most likely to obey this law

02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:14.630
the law doesn't say anything at all

02:13:14.630 --> 02:13:17.610
about distance between patterns

02:13:20.310 --> 02:13:24.070
anyway this is Ninian Marshall's law

02:13:24.630 --> 02:13:29.250
now it would be quite possible to have a science fiction story

02:13:29.250 --> 02:13:33.450
based on a law like this

02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:36.470
it would be entirely consistent

02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:38.630
with what we know so far of ESP

02:13:38.630 --> 02:13:39.730
it might have to go further

02:13:40.190 --> 02:13:43.650
but what Ninian Marshall's law does is to in fact

02:13:45.190 --> 02:13:47.690
take ESP as the communication category

02:13:47.690 --> 02:13:50.070
that is it might happen for instance

02:13:50.070 --> 02:13:52.770
that we're having ESP all the time

02:13:53.530 --> 02:13:57.730
except that my pattern is very much like your pattern for fish

02:13:59.630 --> 02:14:02.810
so whenever I'm thinking something like fish

02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:05.010
and you're thinking something like elephant

02:14:06.330 --> 02:14:08.490
we have a great tendency to do so

02:14:09.150 --> 02:14:09.970
both of us

02:14:11.190 --> 02:14:14.330
now sure you can set this up in a communication paradigm

02:14:14.330 --> 02:14:16.790
once you discover that my fish was like your elephant

02:14:17.590 --> 02:14:18.630
or vice versa

02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:23.810
but it certainly wouldn't look at all like a mental radio

02:14:24.810 --> 02:14:27.270
it might well be that we could learn to send messages

02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:30.510
if we had for instance half a dozen people

02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:33.730
who were dispersed around the world

02:14:33.730 --> 02:14:37.410
of whom we'd ascertain that their patterns for particular symbols

02:14:37.410 --> 02:14:38.370
were fairly similar

02:14:39.170 --> 02:14:42.270
and we could train them to detect the change in their own pattern

02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:46.310
when somebody else thought

02:14:46.930 --> 02:14:49.950
one of the other people produced their pattern

02:14:50.690 --> 02:14:52.770
and so you could get a kind of false code

02:14:53.790 --> 02:14:55.690
in terms of recognize change

02:14:55.690 --> 02:14:58.150
when I think fish

02:14:58.950 --> 02:15:00.490
does anything happen to that

02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:02.990
to that thing

02:15:03.850 --> 02:15:05.530
and if it does

02:15:05.530 --> 02:15:08.570
then I've got one point of the message

02:15:09.410 --> 02:15:10.790
and as I say

02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:14.190
this is consistent with what we know

02:15:14.190 --> 02:15:15.550
it's different

02:15:17.070 --> 02:15:18.330
certainly unconventional

02:15:19.610 --> 02:15:24.530
and it clearly could be a quite good kind of science fiction story

02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:27.530
now I'm not saying someone's got to write that story

02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:28.430
all I'm saying is

02:15:29.410 --> 02:15:33.530
that would in some ways be a rather better kind of ESP sort of story

02:15:33.530 --> 02:15:34.570
than some of the ones we get

02:15:35.550 --> 02:15:39.490
or it's a pity that someone is not doing that sort of thing I think

02:15:42.090 --> 02:15:42.990
just an idea

02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:46.250
I think we're going to have to sort of cut this short now anyway

02:15:47.730 --> 02:15:51.030
there's no more questions I'd like to thank Dr Dell

02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:53.290
for giving nice interesting sort of discussion

02:15:59.970 --> 02:16:00.530
applause

02:16:15.110 --> 02:16:16.470
popular if you like

02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:18.630
it's not popular most of it

02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:22.370
anyway the lyrics to all this

02:16:22.370 --> 02:16:24.510
can be found in the latter half of your handbook

02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:27.190
on five pages in the latter part of the handbook

02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:30.830
it's mainly if you want to think along

02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:32.650
most of it's lyrical content

02:16:32.650 --> 02:16:34.790
on the science fiction

02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:37.250
the first track is by Genesis called Watcher of the Skies

02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:42.030
Michael Boodal

02:16:42.030 --> 02:16:46.810
the first track is by Genesis called Watcher of the Skies

02:16:46.810 --> 02:16:50.690
and it was apparently inspired by the latter part of the childhood's end

02:16:50.690 --> 02:16:51.650
I'll just see Chloe

02:16:54.510 --> 02:17:24.490
music

02:17:24.510 --> 02:17:54.490
music

02:17:54.510 --> 02:18:24.490
music

02:18:24.510 --> 02:18:54.490
music

02:18:54.510 --> 02:19:24.490
music

02:19:24.490 --> 02:19:32.430
music

02:19:54.490 --> 02:19:55.690
music

02:19:55.690 --> 02:19:57.290
music

02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:59.070
music

02:21:24.490 --> 02:21:29.490
At the end of man's long human life

02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:40.930
From life alone

02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:45.190
to life as one

02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:50.030
Sing that now your journey is done

02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:54.350
So no ship is steady

02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:57.110
No mercy has to see

02:21:57.110 --> 02:22:03.950
When you survive on the ocean of the air

02:22:07.210 --> 02:22:11.290
All ancient children you will see

02:22:12.890 --> 02:22:17.030
I've been in my heart and now I'm so bored you will leave

02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:46.630
Sing that now your thought will be gone

02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:52.970
Where you gone you know you'll let me go

02:22:55.370 --> 02:22:59.090
Watch out of the sky what you're about

02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:05.370
Your face alone is fake you're all

02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:46.610
I'm so bored you'll let me go

02:23:46.610 --> 02:24:16.590
Sing that now your thought will be gone

02:24:41.330 --> 02:24:46.570
Sing that now your thought will be gone

02:24:46.570 --> 02:24:50.450
There's a terrific normal situation about the aftermath of an atomic war

02:25:16.570 --> 02:25:46.550
Sing that now your thought will be gone

02:25:46.570 --> 02:25:56.710
If you smile at me I will understand that there's nothing that we're gonna have to wear

02:25:56.710 --> 02:26:03.410
I'll just stay the same way

02:26:12.650 --> 02:26:16.390
I cannot see by your cold breath

02:26:16.390 --> 02:26:19.070
You're from the other side

02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:24.210
But just one thing I got to know can't simply

02:26:24.210 --> 02:26:27.090
leave the war

02:26:38.770 --> 02:26:41.930
So can I have some of your purple baby

02:26:41.930 --> 02:26:47.890
Yes I've been eating him since seven weeks now

02:26:47.890 --> 02:26:49.950
I haven't gotten sick in the winter

02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:52.950
I'm looking for some life

02:27:00.650 --> 02:27:07.750
We shift on the water very free and easy

02:27:08.890 --> 02:27:14.010
You know the way it's supposed to be

02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:19.290
Silver on the shoreline let us be

02:27:19.290 --> 02:27:24.690
Talking about very free and easy

02:27:44.930 --> 02:27:51.270
If all the clips that fly is what you got

02:27:52.010 --> 02:27:57.890
All the candles that blow and respite

02:27:57.890 --> 02:28:04.170
Still have all human feelings by

02:28:04.170 --> 02:28:06.790
Free all living

02:28:06.790 --> 02:28:10.170
You know me though

02:28:43.230 --> 02:28:45.510
You know me

02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.550
You know me

02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:47.110
You know me

02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:48.450
You know me

02:28:48.450 --> 02:29:18.430
You know me

02:29:31.310 --> 02:29:34.550
You know me

02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:37.710
You know me

02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:44.550
You know me

02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:48.210
You know me

02:29:48.210 --> 02:29:48.410
You know me

02:30:14.970 --> 02:30:22.430
It's a fair wind, blowing wool out of the stock on my shoulder

02:30:26.850 --> 02:30:30.050
Guess I'll sit across the road

02:30:44.020 --> 02:30:49.870
The next track by Pink Floyd is no lyrics of real consequence

02:30:51.330 --> 02:30:53.450
It's only the music and the song's vision content

02:30:53.450 --> 02:30:55.330
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:31:37.410 --> 02:31:38.610
The next track by Pink Floyd is no lyrics of real consequence

02:31:38.610 --> 02:31:38.650
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:31:38.650 --> 02:31:38.690
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:31:38.690 --> 02:31:46.490
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:31:46.490 --> 02:32:02.910
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:32:02.910 --> 02:32:02.990
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:16.430
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:32:16.430 --> 02:32:45.270
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:45.290
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:32:57.970 --> 02:33:01.950
Adding control for the out of the stock

02:33:01.950 --> 02:33:01.970
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:33:01.970 --> 02:33:06.310
Setting control go to full-end

02:33:06.310 --> 02:33:09.570
Setting control for the out of the stock

02:39:19.690 --> 02:39:23.230
She's a rich, rich man.

02:39:27.310 --> 02:39:30.430
She's a rich man.

02:39:30.430 --> 02:39:31.010
She's a rich man.

02:39:36.370 --> 02:39:38.590
She's a rich man.

02:39:38.590 --> 02:40:08.570
She's a rich man.

02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:38.030
She's a rich man.

02:40:40.890 --> 02:40:44.190
So the next tracks by King Crimson, 21st century, Skidward Man.

02:40:44.670 --> 02:40:47.030
It's exactly nine years old. Turn it here by the music.

02:41:39.170 --> 02:41:45.690
That's what I call, no-signal scream.

02:41:47.130 --> 02:41:53.970
That's what I call, 20% Skidward Man.

02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:18.550
Édreck, Bob War,

02:42:19.390 --> 02:42:22.090
For the Turkish bureau pile,

02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:24.010
Is a Jeffrey.

02:42:24.210 --> 02:42:25.490
With no ball.

02:42:26.410 --> 02:42:29.890
twenty-first century's Skidward Man.

02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:15.910
Let's see it, come and read.

02:47:16.650 --> 02:47:19.330
Oh, it's all in tune, believe.

02:47:19.890 --> 02:47:23.030
Now he's got, he really needs,

02:47:23.530 --> 02:47:27.550
When the birth and dreams get so damn long.

02:48:32.610 --> 02:48:36.770
The next track is about as good an example of science fiction as you likely to find in music.

02:48:36.770 --> 02:48:42.250
This is by Van de Graaf Generator. It's called, what is it called?

02:48:45.370 --> 02:48:51.330
It's called The Pioneers Overseas, about what happens when a group of people travels faster than a speed of light.

02:48:51.810 --> 02:48:53.390
About the very strange things that happen.

02:49:06.770 --> 02:49:36.750
The Pioneers Overseas

02:49:36.770 --> 02:49:45.770
The Pioneers Overseas

02:49:45.770 --> 02:49:48.790
The Pioneers Overseas

02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:03.710
The Pioneers Overseas

02:50:03.710 --> 02:50:10.310
That's the Earth in 1983, think of growth before the galaxy.

02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:17.550
Red and I set up into the void of thousands of to be exploited.

02:50:17.550 --> 02:50:25.710
Somebody help me, I call him. Somebody help me, I call him down.

02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:39.390
In the sky, in the world,

02:50:39.390 --> 02:50:48.770
In the sky, in the world.

02:50:48.770 --> 02:50:50.690
In the sky, in the world.

02:50:50.690 --> 02:51:12.310
In the sky, in the world.

02:51:12.310 --> 02:51:18.670
In the sky, in the world.

02:51:30.310 --> 02:51:45.030
In the sky, in the world.

02:51:45.130 --> 02:51:48.650
In the sky, in the world.

02:52:18.650 --> 02:52:21.110
We are the lost ones.

02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:24.450
We are the pioneers.

02:52:26.570 --> 02:52:30.090
We are the lost ones.

02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:36.710
We are the ones that are going to build a statue for

02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:39.830
10 centuries ago.

02:52:42.670 --> 02:52:46.170
Who's 16 for what?

02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:54.770
A lovely whisper in our lock one did

02:52:54.770 --> 02:52:58.110
We are sure they learn to get the best

02:52:58.110 --> 02:53:00.970
And the act from the dead.

02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:04.790
Don't know the world, they were about to go

02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:07.890
Somebody help me out, it's me

02:53:07.890 --> 02:53:12.310
Somebody help me, I'm gonna get this job

02:53:17.770 --> 02:53:22.970
Touch with my life, I have no friends

02:53:23.610 --> 02:53:28.830
Touch with my life, I have no friends

02:53:38.050 --> 02:53:39.010
Music

02:53:45.550 --> 02:53:48.530
Well now, where is the client?

02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:52.530
How do the hell am I?

02:53:53.530 --> 02:53:58.370
Little thing in an aimless way

02:54:10.570 --> 02:54:20.030
Oh, I know where we are

02:54:24.470 --> 02:54:28.970
No they can't be loved

02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:33.870
Touch with my life please

02:54:52.530 --> 02:55:22.510
Music

02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:30.630
There is no fear here

02:55:33.070 --> 02:55:38.910
How could such a thing exist

02:55:42.370 --> 02:55:47.670
In this place where living

02:55:48.670 --> 02:55:56.470
And a wing of being

02:55:58.410 --> 02:56:01.850
Have never been heard of

02:56:01.850 --> 02:56:10.670
Have never been heard of

02:56:20.070 --> 02:56:22.310
How do we get this job

02:59:23.270 --> 02:59:26.130
I am no white alone

02:59:27.430 --> 02:59:30.750
Part of a vacant time zone

02:59:31.430 --> 02:59:34.110
Floating in the void

02:59:39.270 --> 02:59:41.270
Music

02:59:53.870 --> 02:59:58.010
Only till the day

02:59:58.010 --> 03:00:04.110
Be aware of existence

03:00:05.010 --> 03:00:07.650
Music

03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:17.550
Existing awareness

Music

03:00:36.350 --> 03:00:40.170
I am the lost one

03:00:41.630 --> 03:00:44.650
I am the one you fear

03:00:45.650 --> 03:00:48.890
I am the lost one

03:00:50.650 --> 03:00:54.810
I am the one you cross your face

03:00:54.810 --> 03:00:57.890
Or stay where I was

03:00:57.890 --> 03:01:02.370
Or didn't exist in the past

03:01:02.370 --> 03:01:06.130

03:01:48.330 --> 03:01:49.690
This is called Get Him Out My Friday

03:01:49.690 --> 03:01:52.750
And we face on it, believe it or not a real estate act

03:01:54.310 --> 03:01:58.950
And it's an interesting extrapolation of what might happen in the future

03:01:58.950 --> 03:02:00.350
With regard to this sort of thing

03:02:00.830 --> 03:02:01.810
It's quite amusing

He don't get paid

03:02:51.250 --> 03:02:54.230
No life's worth of his wealth

03:02:54.230 --> 03:02:56.550
Get Him Out My Friday

03:02:56.550 --> 03:03:05.130
And we face on it, believe it or not a real estate act

03:03:05.130 --> 03:03:05.150
