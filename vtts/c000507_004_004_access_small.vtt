Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.800 --> 00:34.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.680
And here are your hosts.

00:43.220 --> 00:45.520
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

00:46.040 --> 00:53.420
George R.R. Martin is one of a group of new writers born in the post-war baby boom who is becoming a powerful force in the field of science fiction.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.360
We asked Martin his definition of science fiction.

00:57.220 --> 01:12.200
Science fiction isn't about science. It's what about all literature. It's about people and moral issues and the way people relate to each other and good and bad and love and death and pain and sorrow and all of that stuff.

01:12.660 --> 01:15.740
The only thing that's different about it is it uses a different set of symbols.

01:16.460 --> 01:21.840
It tries to get us out of our here and now world just as traditional fantasy has done for centuries.

01:22.340 --> 01:31.860
But instead of using fantasy type symbols, it uses symbols drawn from what essentially is the new religion of our modern age, science and technology.

01:33.020 --> 01:41.000
The theme that pervades much of Martin's early work is the intrusion of cold hard reality into romance. Martin comments on this element.

01:42.540 --> 01:54.260
The dreams that I grew up with, that other writers of my generation grew up with, Hard Wall Drop, John Barley, people like that have spoken about it in their own writings.

01:55.140 --> 02:03.800
And then the reality unfolded. Our dreams came true, but they didn't. It wasn't the same dreams. It changed.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.840
And in most cases, it changed for the worse.

02:10.880 --> 02:18.960
There was a story of mine called Patrick Henry Jupiter in a Little Red Brick spaceship that's included in Songs of Stars and Shadows.

02:19.420 --> 02:24.800
Probably not one of my most famous stories or one of my better stories.

02:25.440 --> 02:33.780
But it's one in which this particular question is addressed in a very direct kind of manner because I use a protagonist who feels the same way.

02:34.460 --> 02:43.260
The World Science Fiction Convention, when Apollo 11 landed on the moon, gave them a special award for best moon landing ever.

02:43.820 --> 02:51.080
Which I think is completely untrue. In science fiction, there are lots of moon landings that are much more exciting than the one that Apollo 11 did.

02:51.600 --> 03:01.640
In fact, that's the whole point that I support the space program. My dream of, I think, it's a route that mankind should go to.

03:02.520 --> 03:07.600
And in some ways, it's very tragic what's happened to it. And what's happened to it is that NASA really messed it up.

03:07.780 --> 03:13.240
They took the greatest adventure in human history and through a supreme superhuman effort, I managed to make it boring.

03:14.020 --> 03:20.080
That's what's happened to the American space program and that's what I try to address in that particular story.

03:21.540 --> 03:25.920
But the theme in other contexts runs through a lot of my work, particularly my early work.

03:28.040 --> 03:37.560
The fact that we need dreams to sustain us. And that the dreams are often, I mean that's part of, with Morning Comes Missfall too, the dreams are better than the reality.

03:37.560 --> 03:44.680
Truth and beauty. Beauty is truth, truth, beauty, that is all you know and all you need to know. But it's not true.

03:45.120 --> 03:50.020
Some things are beautiful but not true. And some things are true but not beautiful.

03:50.900 --> 03:57.320
I grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey. It's a little industrial city right outside of New York.

03:57.320 --> 04:02.800
At the time it was one of the major oil refining centers in the world. It was true but it wasn't very beautiful.

04:05.040 --> 04:14.780
And I read books that took place on Mars and the asteroid belt and planets of other stars.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.760
And they were pretty beautiful in their way but they weren't true.

04:18.360 --> 04:28.620
So things don't work out that conveniently and that's the whole reality romance thing that much of my work does concern itself with.

04:29.740 --> 04:35.760
In an early Martin story, Slide Show, the space effort is maintained through contributions garnered at fundraisers.

04:36.720 --> 04:42.400
But I wanted to express the fact that I did have reservations and humanitarian concerns and all that about earth.

04:42.640 --> 04:56.600
But I still think the weight of that story is very much towards the space thing and how pitiful it has become where they have to go around and give slide shows to rich people and hope to get a little contribution to continue it.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.820
But I do see us going that way.

05:05.260 --> 05:18.180
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:03.220 --> 06:07.220
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:23.100 --> 06:28.440
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.800
And here are your hosts.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.420
This is David Cruz and Bill Vernon.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.440
Our show today continues the discussion with science fiction author George Martin.

06:43.820 --> 06:51.580
While we were interviewing Martin, he expressed to us his idea that the American space program is in the doldrums because of a poor public relations effort by NASA.

06:52.120 --> 07:00.940
According to Martin, if NASA were to play on people's dreams of exploring the unknown, rather than to harp on the mundane, tangible benefits, the space program would be much better off.

07:01.660 --> 07:07.380
Part of the reason we're going that way is because the way NASA has sold it is totally inappropriate.

07:08.400 --> 07:26.620
They're trying to make people, they have people who are poor, they have people who are suffering through social cutbacks, they have people who don't have enough to eat, whose children are ill-clothed, who are suffering from poverty and crime and stuff like that.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.660
In other words, we have a hell of a lot of problems in their life.

07:30.060 --> 07:41.080
And they're trying to say, well, we're cutting back social programs, but we don't want to cut back the space program, and you ought to support this decision because it gave you Teflon frying pans.

07:43.360 --> 07:51.760
Now, if somebody doesn't have any chicken to cook up, the fact that their frying pan may have Teflon on it is not going to convince them.

07:51.760 --> 07:58.080
And the fact that the space program produced Teflon frying pans is of little interest to them.

07:59.660 --> 08:07.620
Ditto hand calculators, and all of the other benefits of space program is supposed to have brought us and didn't even brought us.

08:08.280 --> 08:13.340
But these same people have television sets on which they watch sports.

08:14.620 --> 08:18.500
You know, probably we're all very excited about the Super Bowl and the World Series.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.520
Follow Adventure Series and all that.

08:25.700 --> 08:36.200
And there's the potential support for the space program, not the practical, dull, accountant cell where they show them the balance sheets and say, well, here's all the Teflon, you know.

08:36.540 --> 08:42.280
If you want to get public support by a space program, you have to get it by making it exciting, by making it an adventure.

08:45.020 --> 08:52.320
And it is an adventure. It's a colossal adventure. It's enormously exciting. Why the hell am I addicted to it?

08:52.400 --> 09:01.820
Why are all these people here? Why did our entire generation growing up reading Willie Lay and Vernarvon Braun and what was going to happen?

09:01.980 --> 09:07.160
And the dinosaur projects and the flying wing and the space stations we were going to have.

09:07.160 --> 09:14.200
It was marvelous, heady, wonderful stuff, and instead they're selling us Teflon.

09:14.380 --> 09:20.820
I mean, it's just nonsense. It's the excitement of it that they should sell us.

09:21.120 --> 09:25.820
The strange things that might be discovered, the adventures that are there to be had, the dream of it.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.880
That's the real powering thing.

09:30.120 --> 09:36.760
Not that they're going to be able to make better ball bearings in space because of weightlessness, but the dream of it, that's what they should push.

09:45.400 --> 09:53.420
Music plays a major role in many of Martin's works, from stories such as the lonely songs of Larin Dore and For a Single Yesterday,

09:54.080 --> 09:59.160
to the titles of two of his collections, A Song for Laya and Songs of Stars and Shadows.

09:59.660 --> 10:03.900
A popular song, Brandy, even influenced the plot of the short story Fast Friends.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.420
We asked Martin if he himself was a musician.

10:07.580 --> 10:11.280
Well, none whatsoever. No background whatsoever.

10:12.340 --> 10:21.640
I like songs, music, but I really have no aptitude for it.

10:24.640 --> 10:30.620
When I was living in Chicago, I had a number of musician roommates for a while.

10:31.300 --> 10:38.820
They would bring in other musician friends of theirs who would invariably, because the whole group were musically inclined in one way or another,

10:38.940 --> 10:42.240
would say to me, what instrument do you play? And I would say, I played a typewriter.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.440
That's about the closest I've gotten.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.780
More on George Martin in our next show.

10:56.080 --> 11:01.520
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:01.820 --> 11:04.740
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.560
Stay with us.

12:08.340 --> 12:13.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:16.340 --> 12:17.980
And here are your hosts.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.560
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

12:24.980 --> 12:28.140
Science fiction writer George Martin is the subject of our show today.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.500
Martin spent almost a decade writing short stories before he published his first novel.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.040
Here he comments on the importance of the short story to the beginning writer.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.080
I think that's just the way you break into the field.

12:39.400 --> 12:46.180
And that's one of the strengths of science fiction, is that it's one of the few branches of literature that still has a viable short story market.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.320
Where young writers and beginning writers can learn the ropes, can get their initial publication.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.760
Novels, on the other hand, are not the best way to begin, as Martin tells us.

12:59.520 --> 13:04.640
Novels are large. Novels are formidable pieces of work.

13:05.220 --> 13:09.820
You just don't knock them off in a week or so, and you really have to know what you're doing.

13:12.580 --> 13:17.380
I wrote a lot of short stories in my early years.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.800
Some of them are good, I like to think.

13:20.040 --> 13:24.500
Some of them are maybe even excellent, and some of them are terrible.

13:29.620 --> 13:35.140
And I learned a lot through the process of doing that, and also through the process of selling them.

13:36.240 --> 13:40.880
If I had been writing novels, I mean, it would be very easy to wash out writing novels.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.920
You spend a year and a half writing a book, and then no one wants to buy it.

13:44.060 --> 13:47.260
It's terrible, where it falls apart at the end, part of it's good, part of it's bad.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.800
That's a bad way to begin, I think.

13:50.240 --> 13:55.720
I've always felt that it's much better, especially in a field like science fiction,

13:55.840 --> 13:59.640
where you can publish your short stories for any kind of young writer to begin with short stories,

13:59.640 --> 14:05.660
to learn his craft there, also to establish a name for himself by selling to the markets.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.600
It's much sounder commercial strategy.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.500
Martin believes that if one does not establish himself as a short story writer first,

14:12.900 --> 14:14.500
it's more difficult to break into print.

14:15.240 --> 14:20.940
You see in the modern, present commercial marketplace of literature,

14:21.240 --> 14:24.400
you see a whole lot of books coming out first novels.

14:24.400 --> 14:28.580
There's nothing that's more deadly than a first novel.

14:30.300 --> 14:36.200
That was not always the case in science fiction.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.960
Once upon a time, there was a large enough audience that bought every science fiction book that came out

14:40.960 --> 14:44.840
that a writer publishing his first novel could be sure to certain minimum thing.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.920
Science fiction's gotten too big for that now.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
That's no longer the case.

14:49.320 --> 14:54.260
So a lot of people, Joe Blow writes his first novel, sells it,

14:54.300 --> 14:58.980
because it's pretty good to get a publish, it just dies, it's a dismal, dreary death,

14:59.360 --> 15:00.540
because no one's ever heard of him.

15:01.560 --> 15:06.240
So unless he has some gimmick and lets us some reason, nobody reads his novel, nobody gives him a chance.

15:06.860 --> 15:09.900
The way I did it in hindsight is much the better way.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.740
I built up a reputation over five or six years from my short stories.

15:13.740 --> 15:19.460
And when I finally did write Dying of the Light, my first novel, it was not by Joe Blow.

15:19.720 --> 15:28.300
It was the first novel by George R.R. Martin that trumpet's drum roll and the world was much more receptive to it

15:28.300 --> 15:30.220
than had I thrown it out beforehand.

15:30.860 --> 15:36.180
So I think any writer wanting to break into science fiction should begin with short stories

15:36.180 --> 15:40.880
and should make a reputation with those and then make the transition to novels.

15:42.060 --> 15:46.220
At the end of each story in Martin's collections is a date and a location.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.140
We asked Martin why Ian's story is in this manner.

15:50.140 --> 15:54.740
Instead of writing the end, you put where you were and what time story was written,

15:55.220 --> 16:01.920
it helps put them in a chronological perspective for readers who are interested in kind of observing the writer's growth

16:01.920 --> 16:07.080
because the order that they're published in is often not at all an appropriate indication

16:07.080 --> 16:10.880
of the order that they were written in, publishing schedules being what they are.

16:11.020 --> 16:15.640
Some stories are rushed into print, some are held for years, some stories you can't sell for years

16:15.640 --> 16:19.520
and you finally find a place for them and they come out five years after you wrote them.

16:22.500 --> 16:27.500
So to really get an idea of kind of evolution and change as a writer goes through,

16:27.660 --> 16:30.260
those sorts of dates are important.

16:30.920 --> 16:34.200
In our next show we'll discuss Martin's novel, Dying of the Light.

16:41.660 --> 16:44.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:44.500 --> 16:47.160
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:47.160 --> 16:50.360
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.560
The next thing I'm doing next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:56.460 --> 18:01.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:01.720 --> 18:06.040
And here are your hosts.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.300
This is David Cruz and Bill Vernon.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.320
In today's show we continue our discussion with Science Fiction writer George Martin.

18:18.160 --> 18:23.320
Martin's first novel was the enthusiastically received, critically acclaimed, Dying of the Light.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.140
The story behind the title of this novel is interesting.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.880
I wrote the book as after the festival,

18:30.920 --> 18:32.660
which was my title for it.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.760
I sold the book to Pocket Books.

18:38.300 --> 18:43.700
At the same time I sold a version to Analog for serialization in Analog Magazine,

18:44.780 --> 18:50.160
and they wanted it cut considerably, so I cut it for them by 30,000 words,

18:51.360 --> 18:54.040
which is a pretty substantial cut.

18:55.480 --> 19:01.280
And when I did that, I said, well, I want this serial version published under a different title,

19:01.560 --> 19:04.840
because I don't want people reading a serial and thinking they've read the book.

19:05.980 --> 19:08.120
Not when there are 30,000 words difference.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.160
The book is a lot better than the serial.

19:12.260 --> 19:16.720
So I told the editor of Analog to call the serial version Mockman,

19:18.180 --> 19:21.640
because my book was going to be called After the Festival, which I've written it under.

19:21.640 --> 19:27.500
He didn't like the title Mockman, but he kind of agreed under protest.

19:29.360 --> 19:35.400
Then my book publisher calls back and says that the higher-up Peter Mayer,

19:35.460 --> 19:38.980
who was running the company at the time, big publishing hotshot,

19:39.280 --> 19:42.540
not a science fiction editor, but the head of the whole Pocket Books empire,

19:42.640 --> 19:49.260
then he didn't like After the Festival as a title, because it wasn't science-fictional enough.

19:51.640 --> 19:56.740
They were willing to make it after the Star Festival, but that gave me goosebumps

19:56.740 --> 19:59.880
and made me want to decapitate someone.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.200
So I said, no, no.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.400
But they threw out After the Festival.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.340
So I had to come up with a new title.

20:05.600 --> 20:10.100
I came up with about 12 of them, most of which were pretty limp, and I sent in a list

20:12.100 --> 20:17.780
of these 12 kind of dreadig which one they would pick, because I didn't like any of them.

20:18.620 --> 20:22.940
And then, like two days after I sent in a list, I thought of Dying in a Light,

20:23.240 --> 20:24.760
and I liked that title a great deal.

20:25.580 --> 20:29.620
I liked it almost as much as After the Festival.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.500
It's real close.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.920
Right now I wouldn't know which title I liked best.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.300
They're both very appropriate for the book.

20:37.660 --> 20:43.880
And the publisher liked Dying in a Light, and I sent it in two days after the list of 12 bad suggestions.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.740
And the publisher said, oh, Dying in a Light, that's fine.

20:47.100 --> 20:47.720
We'll call it that.

20:48.220 --> 20:53.700
At that point, I called up the editor of Analog and said, well, I still want a different title,

20:53.780 --> 20:58.440
but After the Festival is now free because publisher changed it.

20:58.760 --> 21:02.400
So call the serial version after the festival.

21:02.700 --> 21:07.660
So my original title was used on the serial version, and the Dying of the Light title from Thomas

21:07.660 --> 21:10.240
was used on the book, the fuller version.

21:11.320 --> 21:15.600
One of the themes Martin explores in Dying of the Light is that of the misunderstanding

21:15.600 --> 21:18.320
that can develop between people from different cultures.

21:19.540 --> 21:26.840
There's a very significant point of the whole book is the role of names,

21:27.540 --> 21:33.200
which I call it in the book, the importance of names, really the importance of language and linguistics,

21:34.020 --> 21:37.580
to what we are able to think, to what we are able to conceive.

21:37.580 --> 21:43.500
The hero of Dying of the Light, the protagonist, gets in trouble throughout the book

21:43.500 --> 21:46.020
because he insists on making false translations.

21:46.840 --> 21:51.840
He'll see something and he'll say, well, these people are slaves, but they're not slaves.

21:53.620 --> 21:56.720
There's a word for it in the book, an alien word, and it's different.

21:56.940 --> 22:00.960
There are important differences from slavery, but he sees it only in his own terms.

22:00.960 --> 22:06.660
He sees people and he has to define them as friends, let us say.

22:06.880 --> 22:12.740
When the word is tame, it means something very different, similar in some ways, different in other ways.

22:13.300 --> 22:19.620
And to really understand another culture, you have to be able to think in their language, in their terms,

22:19.740 --> 22:27.720
and not make false translations to your own terms that simplify and distort simply by the act of translating.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.620
More on George Martin in our next show.

22:38.400 --> 22:44.480
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:44.480 --> 22:47.700
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:29.380 --> 23:33.560
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:49.440 --> 23:54.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.140
And here are your hosts.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.980
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

24:06.360 --> 24:10.140
1980 was a successful year for Science Fiction author George Martin.

24:10.620 --> 24:14.260
Martin received the Hugo Award for his short story, The Way of Cross and Dragon,

24:14.580 --> 24:17.960
and both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for his novelette, Sand Kings.

24:18.460 --> 24:22.320
Sand Kings is one of those timeless stories that is destined to be a classic.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.520
In 1981, the novel Windhaven was published.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.680
It was written by Martin in conjunction with Lisa Tuttle.

25:01.700 --> 25:02.220
We learned that Windhaven as a novel was not the original intent of Martin and Tuttle.

25:02.220 --> 25:06.060
The first writer would rewrite the portion the second writer had gone on,

25:06.100 --> 25:08.540
so each of us essentially rewrote the other one's sections,

25:08.900 --> 25:15.060
and we alternated doing the first drafts after having worked out the bullet outlines of the plot together in conference.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.060
It took place through the mail.

25:18.820 --> 25:23.200
We learned that Windhaven as a novel was not the original intent of Martin and Tuttle.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.420
Rather, it started out as a shorter story.

25:26.120 --> 25:31.640
Actually, it began as a much shorter story, a thing called My Brother's Wings that we completed in collaboration.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.680
It showed it to Ben Boven. He said, it doesn't really end satisfactorily.

25:36.020 --> 25:38.160
It needs to be much longer, and he was right.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.680
We went back and we expanded it and we produced the storms at Windhaven.

25:42.140 --> 25:49.620
But I think by the time we finished that, it was pretty clear to us that there needed to be more.

25:51.180 --> 25:57.600
By the time we did One Wing, years later, we let years elapse in between the writing of the first and second parts,

25:58.320 --> 25:59.880
we knew exactly what we were doing.

26:00.020 --> 26:03.340
We had the structure of the entire book and the role that One Wing played,

26:03.480 --> 26:08.280
both in relation to storms that came before and in relation to the fall that came after.

26:08.980 --> 26:13.340
So by then, One Wing was written, both as an individual and to Ben as part of the book.

26:14.340 --> 26:20.660
Much of the novel's action is centered on the characters flying about on wings mounted on and powered by their arms.

26:21.100 --> 26:25.920
We asked Martin about the research he did to ensure that the mechanical aspects of flying are practical.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.960
Well, I did some research on hang gliding.

26:29.720 --> 26:37.360
I got some books on it and read, so I'd be able to give the story a diverse multitude of required.

26:37.360 --> 26:45.160
We must have done fairly well in terms of accuracy because hang gliding magazines serialized storms of Windhaven after it came out.

26:46.080 --> 26:50.160
Obviously, they would not have done it if it had been too full of egregious errors.

26:53.380 --> 26:59.700
In fact, I noticed I picked up years after the original story came out in Hang Gliding Magazine.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.500
I picked up another issue of Hang Gliding Magazine on the stands.

27:02.500 --> 27:11.680
I discovered that all these people were selling Windhaven altimeters and, you know, the Windhaven brand regalosales

27:11.680 --> 27:17.100
and they become like a brand's name or something like that, so I impressed someone out there.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.200
Martin explained the plans he and Tuttle have for Windhaven.

27:21.840 --> 27:25.260
My conception of it is as a real trilogy.

27:25.260 --> 27:35.640
That is to say, neither one big book nor a series of unrelated books, but essentially we began two stories when we began Windhaven.

27:35.860 --> 27:40.660
We began the story of Maris of Wester Amberley, which ended at the end of Windhaven,

27:41.440 --> 27:46.580
and we also began a story about the social changes initiated by Maris.

27:46.780 --> 27:53.240
And that social changes rippling through the culture, affecting all sorts of things.

27:54.400 --> 27:59.500
That story is not conclusive. That story requires more volumes.

28:01.180 --> 28:08.060
But hopefully there will only be two of them that we have originally conceived.

28:09.220 --> 28:17.060
If that, if you look around ten years from now and you find that I'm working on the ninth Windhaven book with Lisa,

28:17.060 --> 28:23.160
you know, I have sold out. And hopefully that will not happen.

28:30.420 --> 28:36.020
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:36.020 --> 28:39.300
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
