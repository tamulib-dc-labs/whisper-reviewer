WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:04.980
The tape is rolling, so it's all on record now.

00:06.200 --> 00:10.860
And I obviously have your biography, but I'll have to ask some things to the fans.

00:11.560 --> 00:15.380
Okay, tell us a little bit how you grew up and what might have influenced you to write

00:15.380 --> 00:15.920
science fiction.

00:16.500 --> 00:25.060
Well, I grew up in a suburb of Cleveland called Fairview Park, and I think I was influenced

00:25.060 --> 00:30.940
to write science fiction by the fact that when I was a kid, I'd go into the public library

00:30.940 --> 00:35.460
once or twice a week, and they had a very small children section.

00:36.620 --> 00:41.480
And it wasn't long before I devoured all the hearty boys and the Tom Swift.

00:42.340 --> 00:46.180
And I went to the librarian and said, hey look, let me into the older section, okay,

00:46.280 --> 00:48.100
because there's nothing left here for me to read.

00:48.600 --> 00:52.580
And she took me over to this row of books that had rockets on their spines and said,

00:52.580 --> 00:55.420
if you read any of these, I said, no, what is it?

00:55.500 --> 00:58.060
She said it's called science fiction, why don't you give it a try.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.800
And that pretty much started a lifelong love affair with science fiction right there.

01:06.200 --> 01:11.980
In six months, it cleaned out that library, but by then I was in this paper carrier and

01:11.980 --> 01:16.300
was making enough money every week to go out and buy four or five paperbacks, those were

01:16.300 --> 01:16.640
the days.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.820
And it just never stopped.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.060
I got into college, still reading five, ten science fiction paperbacks a week, and realized

01:29.880 --> 01:33.960
my tastes, I think, matured a little and I started saying, my God, I could write better

01:33.960 --> 01:34.440
than this.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.320
I said that so often that one of my roommates said, can I put up or shut up?

01:41.100 --> 01:45.520
And I started writing in junior, senior year of college.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.980
Discovered it was a lot harder than I had thought.

01:51.100 --> 01:59.400
But by, I think it was 1973, I'd made my first short story sale to analog and followed it

01:59.400 --> 02:04.600
up a couple of years later with another and decided, well, you know, this sort of be working

02:04.600 --> 02:05.180
for a living.

02:09.320 --> 02:16.360
Okay, you lived in the Orient, different places in the Orient for some time and your major

02:16.360 --> 02:17.400
was Chinese studies.

02:17.880 --> 02:23.180
How did you get interested in Chinese studies and in the Orient and has that influenced your

02:23.180 --> 02:25.140
science fiction in any way?

02:27.980 --> 02:34.200
Well, to start with, I wound up in the Orient because my father joined the Peace Corps in

02:34.200 --> 02:40.180
1966 and trucked the entire family off to Seoul, Korea for, well, I was there for two

02:40.180 --> 02:42.140
years, the rest of the family was there for four.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.180
This is my junior and senior year in high school.

02:46.240 --> 02:51.120
Went to a small missionary school in Seoul, Korea, Seoul Foreign School.

02:53.940 --> 03:01.080
Because it was Peace Corps, we were sort of under orders to avoid the American community.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.340
We all got extensive language training.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.400
We lived in the Korean community.

03:13.250 --> 03:19.080
After two years of daily language lessons and all, I'd become reasonably fluent in Korean.

03:20.720 --> 03:27.920
And when I graduated high school, I had this dream that I would become the world's foremost

03:27.920 --> 03:30.040
American authority on Korea.

03:30.620 --> 03:35.760
So when I applied to colleges, I applied to universities that had good, solid Korean studies

03:35.760 --> 03:36.280
programs.

03:37.340 --> 03:38.600
Yale was one of them.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.740
They accepted me and I accepted them joyfully.

03:44.660 --> 03:50.520
Came back from Seoul to New Haven, Connecticut and discovered that over the summer they'd

03:50.520 --> 03:56.580
killed their entire Korean studies program, which sort of left me out on a limb.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.460
I cast around from the nearest related subject and that was Chinese studies.

04:02.440 --> 04:07.980
I figured I could, since most of Korean history is actually written in Chinese rather than

04:07.980 --> 04:11.020
in Korean, I figured, well, okay, I'll learn Chinese now.

04:12.360 --> 04:18.020
And spent four years discovering that I was not cut out to be an academic.

04:21.260 --> 04:26.360
Did this experience in the Orient and in studying other cultures, does that have any

04:26.360 --> 04:31.360
influence as far as you're writing something like alien cultures or what it's like to be

04:31.360 --> 04:32.480
among aliens?

04:32.760 --> 04:33.540
So it's very much.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.580
It's hit me on a couple of different levels.

04:37.780 --> 04:43.820
One is this is more true, I think, of Americans who live in Asia than those who live in Europe

04:44.380 --> 04:51.420
or South America because in Asia, you're very conscious of the fact that you're a foreigner.

04:51.760 --> 04:52.840
I mean, you're racially different.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.580
You do not have black hair and dark brown eyes.

04:56.920 --> 05:04.200
Everywhere you walk, people look at you, especially in some of the more rural areas of the country

05:04.200 --> 05:08.800
like Korea, where the last time they saw an American was during the war, 20 years ago,

05:09.320 --> 05:10.660
20 years before I was there.

05:12.880 --> 05:18.100
They are unabashed in their curiosity and it really enchangers the self-consciousness

05:18.100 --> 05:26.340
in the American to constantly be stared at, to have people touching to see if you feel

05:26.340 --> 05:27.960
the same as a Korean does.

05:28.680 --> 05:35.300
So I think that's a fact in my science fiction writing and how a person feels when he's among

05:35.300 --> 05:35.880
aliens.

05:37.100 --> 05:43.560
At the same time, Asian languages and cultures are, you know, they're significantly different

05:43.560 --> 05:48.180
from Western cultures in terms of the way they view almost everything.

05:49.550 --> 05:56.060
And although it's not really an alien psychology, it's sufficiently different.

05:56.260 --> 06:02.940
It gives me sort of an insight into how, you know, attention being from, you know, Rigel

06:02.940 --> 06:10.160
or whatever could view things differently, could take a really far off perspective on

06:11.720 --> 06:13.900
something we just take for granted.

06:16.420 --> 06:21.120
When you first started writing science fiction and then other fiction, you wrote short stories.

06:21.560 --> 06:26.080
How long did you write short stories before you then moved to the novel form and how did

06:26.080 --> 06:27.060
you make that transition?

06:28.380 --> 06:29.540
Oh, it seems like forever.

06:31.640 --> 06:40.140
Oh, I think I wrote short heavily for, oh, a good day.

06:41.940 --> 06:47.980
I started really writing in earnest, seriously in the summer of 72 after I graduated from

06:47.980 --> 06:48.380
college.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.640
And that was, I was back out in Asia at that time.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.960
I was teaching, I had a lot of free time.

06:57.040 --> 07:03.160
And I turned out a lot of stories in 72, 73, came back to the States in 74.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.400
You know, I'd made a couple sales.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.080
I thought I could do better, kept at it.

07:09.720 --> 07:15.480
And I guess between 72 and 76, I probably wrote close to 100 short stories.

07:17.820 --> 07:23.060
And I was, by 75, 76, I was selling in a respectable clip.

07:24.560 --> 07:34.260
I began to realize that on one hand, I mean, from a purely mercenary point of view, you

07:34.260 --> 07:35.900
know, at least not science fiction short stories.

07:36.720 --> 07:41.840
There are markets out there that want short stories, that need a lot of them, but they

07:41.840 --> 07:42.520
don't pay enough.

07:43.880 --> 07:50.200
And so I started, for financial reasons, looking at the novel probably as early as, oh, late

07:50.200 --> 07:51.760
74 or early 75.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.260
But I was scared.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.220
For a long time, it terrified me to think of tackling a novel.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.080
I mean, a novel is big.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.700
You know, a short story, you go 5,000 words and you say, end.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.060
And that's it.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.360
20 pages all nice and neat.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.100
You can retype 20 pages in the master.

08:09.240 --> 08:09.400
I know.

08:09.660 --> 08:13.200
You can write the whole thing in a week if you really push yourself.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.140
But a novel, I mean, that's Mount Everest.

08:17.340 --> 08:26.720
So I put off writing the novel until, I think, 75, 76 before I even started admitting, hey,

08:27.340 --> 08:30.100
it's time to get going on this.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.280
And even then I dawdled some more.

08:37.460 --> 08:44.140
Finally, people were sensing my reluctance to tackle this and a lot of my friends started

08:44.140 --> 08:44.820
giving me trouble.

08:45.980 --> 08:47.840
Hey, you know, come on, it's time.

08:48.100 --> 08:48.700
You should do it.

08:49.580 --> 08:57.060
So I did, wrote Bandersnatch, sold it to Banson Books and been writing novels for the sense.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.320
Bandersnatch was written in first person, which is usually kind of a hard way to write.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.840
How did you decide to do it that way?

09:07.880 --> 09:11.960
Well, first person is a real hard way to write well.

09:14.260 --> 09:17.400
But it's a very easy way in which to write.

09:20.740 --> 09:25.120
Bandersnatch might possibly have been a better book, had it been written in third person.

09:25.620 --> 09:28.160
But first person just seemed so natural.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.760
I'd written a lot of the stories I'd written had been in first person.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.940
And I just felt that I could have a better control of my material if I tried it in first person.

09:37.940 --> 09:40.740
I don't think it was completely successful.

09:42.900 --> 09:49.920
One of your talents which really shows through in Bandersnatch is the use of slang and invented language.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.980
Do you work hard on this or does this come naturally?

09:54.100 --> 09:57.120
Bandersnatch, well, no, it does not come naturally.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.700
Some words, some terms come very easily.

10:01.700 --> 10:07.460
When you're working on a 300 page manuscript and you've read it 82 times,

10:09.380 --> 10:12.360
certain words just sort of rise up out of the text at you.

10:12.980 --> 10:18.840
But Bandersnatch was a very deliberate attempt to put the slang in there.

10:20.380 --> 10:28.200
I went to, I think it was at the second or third draft and I realized it lacked sufficient feel of the future.

10:29.340 --> 10:33.260
It just fell much to 1970-ish.

10:34.380 --> 10:37.980
And one of the reasons was the way the people were talking to each other.

10:38.420 --> 10:43.300
So I said, okay, look, let's invent a future slang.

10:44.180 --> 10:45.580
It's not an original concept.

10:46.340 --> 10:47.500
Lots of people have done it.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.300
Lots of people have done it a lot better.

10:49.840 --> 10:55.720
But I sat down and I had this social subgroup.

10:55.720 --> 11:01.120
I figured, okay, what kind of slang which are these people going to develop?

11:01.280 --> 11:03.580
What are they going to have slang words for?

11:04.060 --> 11:05.300
We're talking outlaws here.

11:05.380 --> 11:11.460
Well, they're going to have words for police and each other and criminal acts.

11:12.720 --> 11:20.260
And I tried to almost extrapolate some of the words from the way they are today.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.620
Other words I tried to take off of their origin.

11:25.340 --> 11:27.920
Others sort of accronymiased.

11:28.160 --> 11:35.620
Fedra 3, the locale where much of the book takes place, came from the federal dependence resettlement area,

11:36.200 --> 11:38.460
which FDRA and pretty soon it's Fedra.

11:41.680 --> 11:50.400
Leapers, one of the slang terms for police came from the law enforcement agency personnel and things like that.

11:53.620 --> 11:59.740
This book seemed almost angry, Bander Snatch and then the other people.

12:00.420 --> 12:05.140
Was this anything heavily psychological about this or is this the way it came out?

12:07.240 --> 12:11.680
Well, I think it came out that way for two reasons.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.240
First, the pace at which I wrote it.

12:13.320 --> 12:18.740
It took a long time to write, but I wrote almost entirely on weekends.

12:18.740 --> 12:22.840
And I try to knock off 10 pages a day every weekend.

12:25.280 --> 12:30.220
When you write at that speed, I think emotions just come more naturally to the surface.

12:31.560 --> 12:35.560
Also, the characters in there are for the most part very angry characters.

12:35.840 --> 12:42.680
There's societies outcasts exiled to this artificial peninsula up there in Lake Erie off of Ash-Tabula.

12:42.680 --> 12:51.300
I think at the time I felt that these people would be just naturally bitter, angry, resentful types.

12:52.460 --> 12:56.980
They're losers and losers either tend to be totally innocuous or angry.

13:00.700 --> 13:09.920
One of the characters, Baby Bear, was a real cuddly animal sidekick, which you seem to have in other books as well.

13:09.920 --> 13:14.380
Do you particularly like animals and is there anything that particularly inspired him?

13:17.700 --> 13:19.980
I inspired Baby Bear.

13:22.520 --> 13:27.420
Baby Bear actually came about almost entirely by accident.

13:29.040 --> 13:36.060
I had had, you know, a bandersnatch wandering through this alien jungle.

13:39.440 --> 13:55.160
And I realized he needed like a...the way the story was going, he had to have this climactic battle sequence with a natural force, some sort of wild animal.

13:55.880 --> 14:01.740
And I hadn't had any wild animals in there really big enough for him.

14:01.740 --> 14:14.200
But all of a sudden off the page came this monstrous bear-like animal that almost loomed up before him and started attacking him.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.660
And, you know, he won.

14:17.100 --> 14:20.500
And there I was with a dead bear on the ground.

14:20.900 --> 14:28.000
And just sort of somehow my fingers kept going and there was a sound from the distance and it was the cub.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.980
And the next thing I knew he had a sidekick as you put it.

14:32.980 --> 14:36.140
That was just accidental really.

14:37.260 --> 14:38.460
I think it worked.

14:39.200 --> 14:53.700
And I think from a reader's interest point of view, I think it helps when the protagonist has a sidekick of some sort.

14:56.920 --> 15:04.500
When you're writing science fiction, well, you know, why not give the hero an alien sidekick, Sam and the McGill fiend series?

15:05.800 --> 15:12.240
I think it lets you do a little exploring into alien psychology.

15:12.500 --> 15:21.560
And at the same time, it lets you keep making sort of mirror-like observations of human culture.

15:22.900 --> 15:27.220
So I find it fun and useful and seems to work.

15:29.260 --> 15:35.200
My flies then appeared and I noticed that it's coming out in a second edition with a different cover and everything.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.240
That must be gratifying.

15:37.500 --> 15:37.880
Oh, it is.

15:39.940 --> 15:44.400
This, there are of course a lot of generation-ship ideas in science fiction.

15:44.780 --> 15:48.000
But this was the first one I'd read that was from the computer's point of view.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.700
I'm sure I can't hear you.

15:49.700 --> 15:55.840
Okay. My engineer cautioned me. I should talk less loudly so I'll tell him to screw it.

15:55.940 --> 15:56.040
Okay.

15:58.800 --> 16:06.220
This, Mayfly's was basic. Well, I've read a lot of life-ship or generation-ship science fiction stories and books.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.160
Of course, there's a lot of them.

16:07.180 --> 16:10.040
But this was the first one I'd read from the computer's point of view.

16:12.100 --> 16:12.500
Yeah.

16:14.440 --> 16:22.260
Was that the intent to do that from the computer's point of view or a man who, well, it gives him a bloody brain, basically?

16:24.640 --> 16:30.700
Mayfly started out as, actually, it was a workshop exercise.

16:31.020 --> 16:33.620
I was at the time in a workshop here in New Haven.

16:33.620 --> 16:41.920
And we had to do, oh, I forget, a two-paragraph description of someone.

16:43.380 --> 16:52.160
And I described this character, Metaclura, who took more than the two paragraphs to describe.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.980
He ran on for about a page and all of a sudden he died.

16:57.140 --> 17:03.320
And I took it into the workshop and people said, well, yes, those are nice paragraphs and very good description.

17:03.320 --> 17:07.340
But boy, what have you done here? You know, you've created a character and then killed him. What a waste.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.600
I got angry and said, well, you know, maybe I've killed him, but it's not a waste.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.020
But I can make something of him.

17:14.980 --> 17:16.640
And they said, we dare you.

17:17.280 --> 17:23.600
And pretty soon, Mayfly's was underway with me trying to prove he could write a book about a protagonist who died on page one.

17:24.920 --> 17:30.300
And have that protagonist a very vital part of the entire story, rather than just a haunting memory.

17:30.920 --> 17:37.980
The only way to do that was, of course, to somehow keep him alive and then one thing led to another.

17:38.180 --> 17:43.200
And the next thing I knew, Metaclura was a central computer on the good shit in Mayfly.

17:45.760 --> 17:53.460
Do those kinds of workshops help on right science fiction, either to get started or to discuss pros and cons of stories?

17:54.460 --> 17:56.680
I think they can be very useful.

17:59.700 --> 18:04.820
It's really hard to find someone who can read and criticize science fiction effectively.

18:06.540 --> 18:14.340
The concepts of science fiction are so different from the concepts of the mystery genre or the romance genre, whatever.

18:16.180 --> 18:25.120
And also, you know, if any writer can tell you good friends who aren't writers and close relatives and like that,

18:25.120 --> 18:29.480
when they read your stuff, there's an implicit bias in the way they read it.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.140
They like you.

18:30.380 --> 18:36.960
You're their friend, their spouse, their first cousin once removed, whatever.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.940
But they like you and it influences the way they read your work.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.420
It influences the way they comment on your work to you.

18:43.820 --> 18:47.420
And you don't get honest feedback.

18:48.580 --> 18:54.560
You get rose-colored feedback, which is really flattering to the ego,

18:54.560 --> 18:55.820
but it doesn't help you sell.

18:56.380 --> 19:04.020
When you go into a workshop, there are people who maybe they know you, maybe they don't, maybe they like you, maybe they don't.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.020
But they know writing.

19:06.540 --> 19:09.700
They know science fiction in this particular instance.

19:10.100 --> 19:16.620
And they can say, OK, look, you know, you made a nice start at this story, but it doesn't work because of this, that and the other.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.080
And these are things that probably your friends and relatives wouldn't see to begin with.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.640
And if they did, they downplay it.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.820
Well, you know, this is a little weak here, but don't worry about it.

19:25.820 --> 19:26.660
It's a great story.

19:26.780 --> 19:27.280
We love you.

19:29.320 --> 19:37.860
You can't, you can't really become a selling writer with that sort of critical feedback.

19:38.380 --> 19:39.040
It doesn't help.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.660
And that, I think, is where workshops can be very useful.

19:42.940 --> 19:50.920
They can also be destructive when all the egos are on parade and people start sloshing each other up just for the sure joy of cutting.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.660
And watching somebody else ride.

19:53.260 --> 19:57.480
In that case, the workshop is destructive and not worth it.

19:59.380 --> 20:01.160
OK, I'm glad I asked that.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.060
Back to Mayflies.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.140
Was Mayflies your title?

20:06.060 --> 20:11.980
My original title for Mayflies was Mayflies and Others Spaced Spirits.

20:13.500 --> 20:18.120
Which, if you look it up in books and print, is still the official title.

20:18.920 --> 20:25.500
But the sales department at Berkeley thought that this was a little, sounded too much like an anthology, they said.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.400
And anthologies weren't selling.

20:31.980 --> 20:36.320
There was a market for novels, but simply not for collections of short stories.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.540
And they said, look, let's cut the rest of the title.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.760
Cut it back to one word.

20:39.960 --> 20:43.120
Short, punchy, no confusion over what the book is.

20:46.240 --> 20:51.640
And as if you better know, the writer really doesn't have much choice when the sales department says change the title.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.760
So I went along with it and made my choice.

20:56.940 --> 20:59.960
I haven't yet had a title accepted by a sales department.

21:00.860 --> 21:05.460
I've written six, published six books and the sales department has changed the title on every one of them.

21:08.060 --> 21:13.000
Okay, that brings up, well not the next book, but the next one to talk about.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.520
Because I want to do the other three together.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.900
But War of Omission, what was its original title?

21:18.320 --> 21:21.840
The original title of War of Omission was Lathian Limit.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.060
Which is now the title of one of the subsections.

21:25.060 --> 21:35.380
And my thought that was really artsy and evocative and nice in the sales department said, yeah.

21:38.160 --> 21:41.920
In decisions like this, the sales department always has the final say.

21:42.340 --> 21:48.500
I remember reading in Locust that there was a forthcoming book by that title and I'd wondered what happened to it.

21:48.940 --> 21:49.480
Yeah.

21:49.620 --> 21:49.920
Okay.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.060
That's where it went.

21:51.060 --> 21:57.820
Okay, this book, again, this isn't first person, but it's multiple viewpoints.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.280
Which I understand is just about as hard to write.

22:01.460 --> 22:03.040
Viewpoints of several different people.

22:03.880 --> 22:04.280
Yeah.

22:05.160 --> 22:17.140
I was trying something and what I tried to do in there was inspired by one of those Masterpiece Theater PBS shows.

22:17.740 --> 22:24.300
At this point I'm embarrassed to say I can't remember the play or the characters or the actors or anything.

22:27.300 --> 22:38.640
But it was, the first episode was told entirely from one person's point of view and the second from the point of view of someone else who was also a minor character in that first episode.

22:38.860 --> 22:40.000
And so it went through the series.

22:40.220 --> 22:42.820
And it was a piece, you know, to be fun to try this.

22:43.800 --> 22:57.760
So I very deliberately picked out, I think, eight major characters in there, gave each of them one section of the book to be the protagonist in that section.

22:58.060 --> 23:05.860
And had them up here elsewhere as minor characters until the end is supposed to rotate back and forth through all eight different heads.

23:07.200 --> 23:18.760
I was trying to view this cataclysm from as many different viewpoints as I could while still maintaining storyline continuity.

23:19.880 --> 23:20.620
Did it work?

23:21.380 --> 23:28.660
Yeah, I thought it was great. It was very interesting. I like that particular approach myself and I just don't see it very often.

23:30.680 --> 23:41.500
Okay, as in Bandersnatch, the society that you portray is pretty much strangled by a burgeoning and bureaucracy. Is this a personal view? Do you fear that?

23:41.840 --> 23:56.540
Yes, it is. I really see it happening not only here but pretty much everywhere where governments have been in power for any length of time.

23:57.540 --> 24:06.640
I think it's the nature of the beast, a bureaucracy of any sort, whether it's governmental, corporate, academic.

24:07.740 --> 24:14.420
It achieves a goal beyond its stated purpose or it acquires a new goal.

24:14.420 --> 24:24.160
Well, in that debt goal is to survive, to perpetuate itself, to expand, to get fat and strong and secure.

24:26.160 --> 24:32.760
It goes all the way back to Parkinson's Law and work expands until the time available and when it has you hire two assistants.

24:35.360 --> 24:48.160
I think this is an inevitable trend in any bureaucracy, whether it's Western style capitalism or Maoist communism.

24:48.660 --> 24:58.180
One of Mao's big campaigns was against bureaucracy. He was constantly railing against the way that no matter what he said, no matter what he did,

24:58.180 --> 25:03.920
the bureaucracy kept growing and it kept issuing new regulations and new rules.

25:04.940 --> 25:09.220
Here he was, the most powerful man in China and he couldn't affect the bureaucracy.

25:10.100 --> 25:13.140
So, yeah, that's a very personal sort of point.

25:16.000 --> 25:22.780
If Bander Snatch was a 70s novel, certainly World War Mission was a 60s novel.

25:22.780 --> 25:32.400
I'm just about exactly two years older than you are, so I went through those times and remember them well, some of them quite fondly.

25:34.180 --> 25:38.840
You handled the part at first when it was the revolutionary part pretty well.

25:39.120 --> 25:47.940
I thought it could have gotten, I've read books in fact where it gets pretty slanted one way or the other and I thought you presented it pretty fairly.

25:48.380 --> 25:56.180
That must have been pretty hard to do to present both sides and try to think of them all, I guess in retrospect, maybe it's a little easier than when we were living in that time.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.960
Yeah, retrospect helps a lot there.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.500
What point were you trying to make with this book, if any?

26:05.740 --> 26:06.120
Well,

26:15.580 --> 26:17.860
Well, it's a hard one.

26:22.840 --> 26:30.480
Modern day recapitulation of the statement that power corrupts, an absolute power corrupts, absolutely.

26:33.640 --> 26:43.120
I was trying to say, hey, it's real easy to say that the system stinks and we'll wipe it out, but what happens when you do wipe it out?

26:45.940 --> 26:53.500
I think this is where every revolutionary since the French in 1787 is screwed up thoroughly.

26:53.500 --> 26:59.800
They say, well, you know, the present system is corrupt and it's bloated and it stinks and let's throw it out and we'll have paradise.

27:01.160 --> 27:16.440
I think that's stupid. I'm not a defender of the system, but I think this sort of sweeping, burn it down just doesn't work because, you know, you wind up building on rubble.

27:16.440 --> 27:23.060
You don't move into a structure that you can clean up and straighten out. You've got bashes.

27:23.900 --> 27:28.140
And I think really there's two things where what the book is all about.

27:29.540 --> 27:37.080
The science fictional aspect of that book was the Tissere. Did the Tissere idea come first and then the story follow?

27:39.860 --> 27:58.580
The whole book came from the section titled, The Inmoment, that itself came from a friend of mine and I in this workshop I was in, we're talking about collaborating on a story.

28:00.860 --> 28:10.100
And, you know, we batted around the two ideas and I did up a draft of the story and he said, no, I don't like that at all. I don't want to have anything to do with it.

28:10.500 --> 28:14.040
I said, well, okay, do you mind if I do? He said, no, go right ahead.

28:15.900 --> 28:22.160
I wrote the story, Lissy and LeMence gave it to my agents who read it and said, well, you know, it's going to be difficult yourself.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.420
It's pretty weird and there's not a lot of background in there.

28:27.360 --> 28:33.000
Why don't you try and turn it into a book? You know, because there's clearly more to the story than just this one little sequence.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.440
I thought about it.

28:36.860 --> 28:50.760
Did the proposal for Banson Books that consisted of an outline and that one story, the then editor, Sidney Weinberg, read the proposal six weeks later, said, yeah, I want it, I'll buy it, and we did the deal.

28:55.060 --> 29:10.900
The hook that the Tissier provided was the loss of memory. And I would think when you were writing the book, that would be the hardest thing to keep consistent, that the people forget what happened and write themselves notes, but that doesn't work, that sort of thing.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.980
That's what really hooked me about it.

29:13.620 --> 29:16.420
The hardest part was trying to make it plausible.

29:17.220 --> 29:30.960
And a reviewer, too, has appeared that, you know, has really faulted the book on those grounds, for whatever reason, that person just did not believe the Tissier.

29:32.420 --> 29:47.960
And I put so much effort into trying to make it believable. I think I put more effort into that than any other part of the book, trying to make it seem very natural, and trying to provide possible explanations for why this happened.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.620
Sort of brief meditations on the nature of reality.

29:54.560 --> 30:06.440
For those who accepted the explanation, who believed the Tissier, I think the book worked. And I think if you can't believe it, the book just falls flat.

30:07.640 --> 30:17.840
Yeah, I thought it was believable, and that's what made it work. Yeah, it was sometimes obvious what was going to happen. This guy was going to get wiped out, and they were going to forget about him.

30:18.040 --> 30:21.680
And in some of the cases, you couldn't wait for that to happen.

30:24.600 --> 30:33.540
It must have been fun to sort of sit there and dream about destroying New Haven, this town that you've lived in for many years, piece of the time.

30:33.540 --> 30:52.500
I was here to like, I was sort of offended by my publisher that they cut some references in there. We have a building here in town, and maybe when you edit this, you might want to cut it out too.

30:53.560 --> 31:13.600
It's the Knights of Columbus building, and I think it's possibly the ugliest structure ever erected anywhere in America. It's a huge, towering, ugly brick building with massive turrets at each of the four corners of the building.

31:13.600 --> 31:30.220
I mean, it looks like it was designed to hold off an attack by maddened archers. And I took great pleasure in destroying that in the book, having it totally obliterated from the face of the earth.

31:30.220 --> 31:43.960
And at one point, I had a character bring it back and change his mind. It was so ugly. But the editor took that, cut it right out. Nope, sorry, can't do that. But it was fun taking out the rest in New Haven.

31:45.120 --> 31:50.300
Maybe when you get to Robert Fine Line's statue, you can republish it and put that back in.

31:50.620 --> 31:58.920
I would love to. I would really love to. Of course, the Knights of Columbus won't be too happy, but what can you do?

32:00.340 --> 32:11.980
Okay, now I move on to the journeys of McGill Fian. These books I interpret as being humorous. Is that your primary intent?

32:12.980 --> 32:35.520
Well, my primary intent in the McGill Fian series is to do something light, fast-paced, adventuresome, that nonetheless shows a person of incredible talent growing up and the problems he faces.

32:38.300 --> 32:46.860
It's that aspect of attempts to take lower priority and the adventures of McGill Fian come first.

32:47.560 --> 32:53.700
I do want a book that people can sit down and read quickly and really enjoy.

32:55.400 --> 33:02.480
Not a gloomy book, as Bandersnatch and War of Omission are sort of downbeat books.

33:03.800 --> 33:13.580
Mayfly's is in a way upbeat, but it's got a lot of depressing stuff in it. Whereas McGill Fian is not.

33:13.580 --> 33:22.160
I do it partly to change your pace, to write a book that just moves right along and starts to finish.

33:22.640 --> 33:35.540
There's a lot of things happening. He has a very clear-cut hero who is nonetheless human, has his problems, and nonetheless bulges ahead.

33:36.240 --> 33:42.620
I'm trying to do a lot of things in the Fian series, and I don't know if I've done them until I finish the series.

33:44.980 --> 33:55.760
Okay, once again, in these books there's a bureaucracy that the Flingers have to face. So this must be your thing about bureaucracy, surfacing again.

33:56.140 --> 33:59.640
That's definitely my best law. That's it right there.

34:00.900 --> 34:03.960
Okay, I guess that's a better term than a thing.

34:06.040 --> 34:14.320
These books of the six you've written are the only ones that have aliens because of the type of science fiction that the others are.

34:14.740 --> 34:21.480
Do you introduce aliens to point out various human foyables? Are these just exaggerated humans or what?

34:21.480 --> 34:39.360
No, actually they're not. I'm really trying in the Fian series to create plausible aliens who aren't so alien that you can't understand them,

34:39.360 --> 34:45.540
and aren't so alien that they don't have any reference points with human kinds.

34:45.840 --> 34:50.320
Are you a sufficiently alien that you can't really grasp how to open them?

34:52.220 --> 34:58.380
You know, I think a Michael Bishop has done some marvelous aliens, but they're totally incomprehensible.

34:58.380 --> 35:02.420
I mean they're so alien that they just make no sense whatsoever.

35:04.640 --> 35:14.020
In the Fian series I'm trying to make aliens who are comprehensible, and yet who are not human.

35:14.860 --> 35:23.840
I really think when we run into alien species, and sooner or later we will, they will have traits which we recognize as traits that we have.

35:24.840 --> 35:30.620
In Lava I've got these religious fanatics running around.

35:32.520 --> 35:44.320
I suspect that any sentient race we encounter will, at least in one stage of their development, have gone through an intensely religious period.

35:45.400 --> 35:56.900
I think it might still be religious today if we can tell, but I think any sentient being has to wonder on its origin how it came to be, why it came to be, who created the universe.

35:58.160 --> 36:14.160
So, you know, I'm trying to, not to mirror humanity, but to suggest that there are alternates with which we can have traits, attitudes, and common.

36:17.740 --> 36:28.100
Sam is another alien sidekick, and I guess the thing there is we get to see him grow up and mature and how he reacts in an alien environment.

36:29.560 --> 36:43.740
Yeah, Sam is, of course Sam, I mean he's going to grow up so mixed up, because he's being raised entirely on Earth, well except for their excursions off-world, but he's being raised by a human being with very human values.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.900
But Sam is not human.

36:46.760 --> 36:56.240
And when he gets to his kids to maturity, he's going to be, oh heavens, from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, he's going to be about 15 feet long.

36:57.380 --> 37:01.060
And he can stand about, oh, what, four and a half feet high at the shoulder?

37:01.860 --> 37:08.300
Now, it's the back part of him, and his head will be, you know, pretty much about six feet off the ground.

37:08.620 --> 37:17.900
I mean, he's going to be big, he's going to be very alien looking, and he's going to have a lot of trouble because he's neither one nor the other.

37:18.700 --> 37:23.560
He's not a wrong-doer. He knows nothing of wrong-doer culture.

37:24.700 --> 37:28.100
But he's not, he is not and can never be a human being.

37:31.060 --> 37:34.020
I see lots of interesting problems ahead for Sam.

37:34.900 --> 37:38.260
Is he going to fling McGill into the sun one of these days?

37:39.520 --> 37:40.560
Oh, that would be telling.

37:41.480 --> 37:48.940
I know, I didn't really expect an answer on that. I sure hope not. As a fan, I hope we see some more of them.

37:49.020 --> 37:53.940
Which brings me to the next question, are we going to see some more of McGill and Sam?

37:54.620 --> 37:55.540
Yes, definitely.

37:57.100 --> 38:05.580
At the moment there's a McGill story, and it's from his childhood just been published in Berkeley Showcase.

38:07.560 --> 38:12.820
There will be more being books.

38:13.720 --> 38:17.940
At the moment, I'm saying seven more than the series will end.

38:20.140 --> 38:22.520
So, it'll go out to at least ten.

38:24.760 --> 38:29.260
This may be something you don't want to put on the air, so it doesn't matter.

38:29.340 --> 38:32.680
But I'm curious what you think of the book covers so far for that series.

38:33.540 --> 38:40.980
How realistic they are, if that's how you envision the people, or maybe just book covers in general, for what's been your lot so far.

38:44.760 --> 38:52.480
Well, the theme ones I like, I mean, I hadn't visualized McGill-Pien as looking quite like the way the covers happen.

38:55.480 --> 39:02.540
But, there's something there, the energy tunic, it's not quite what I envisioned, but it's good nonetheless.

39:04.620 --> 39:07.200
I like a lot of what she's done with those covers.

39:07.880 --> 39:12.480
I think they've helped sales really, you know, in paperback marketing, that's what a cover is.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.200
It's our marketing device.

39:20.420 --> 39:28.260
Banders match I was very angry with the cover, because nothing in there relates to the story.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.820
I love Mayflies. I thought Mayflies was a great cover.

39:33.660 --> 39:42.260
And since the fake did it, he read the entire manuscript, there are gizmos on the cover, there's one on the back cover of an alien spaceship.

39:42.460 --> 39:49.440
It is mentioned in one paragraph, buried out there around page 270, but the fake picked it up and put it on the cover.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.760
And I thought it really worked.

39:52.120 --> 39:59.640
Janet Alicia, who has done all the fiends and is also doing the new cover for the second edition of Mayflies,

40:02.640 --> 40:08.880
captures the story in a different way. I mean, she's not 100% technically accurate.

40:10.540 --> 40:14.100
In fact, I'm not going to embarrass her on the end.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.740
We can cut this. It doesn't matter.

40:17.060 --> 40:18.260
Okay, good. Cut this.

40:18.260 --> 40:19.500
Okay, understood.

40:19.960 --> 40:25.320
What's coming up, Janet, she did caverns, which I thought was great.

40:28.160 --> 40:32.840
And then she did reefs, and it has a picture of Sam as an infant on the cover.

40:34.340 --> 40:38.380
And I saw this in proof. It was much too late to do anything about it.

40:38.820 --> 40:42.920
But I wrote Janet, and I wrote Victoria Shockett, who was then out of there at Brooklyn.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.460
I said, hey, what's going on here?

40:45.040 --> 40:47.220
Rangans have four legs and two arms.

40:48.260 --> 40:52.560
And here's this cover where he only has two legs and two arms.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.940
What happened to the other two legs?

40:54.840 --> 40:56.200
And Janet had missed it completely.

40:56.480 --> 41:00.060
But now by that time, she'd already finished the cover for lava.

41:01.740 --> 41:05.460
And she looked at it, and there's Sam with two legs and two arms.

41:05.740 --> 41:09.880
So she painted in a rock in front of him to hide the missing two legs.

41:11.820 --> 41:15.540
She promises to number four. Sam will have four legs.

41:17.500 --> 41:24.500
I hope he is pictured on the succeeding covers, because if he grows to be that large, we'll get to see him grow.

41:25.800 --> 41:28.760
Assuming he survives the books and all.

41:29.100 --> 41:30.520
Which brings me to the next question.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.460
Some of the people that McGill hangs around with don't survive.

41:35.300 --> 41:39.000
And Nadia and Greystein come to mind.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.220
I mean, these are his friends, and they really take it in the ear in these books.

41:45.980 --> 41:49.220
Part of that is cold calculation on my part.

41:49.820 --> 41:58.840
That when you're writing a series, one of the real difficulties is convincing the reader that your hero is in danger.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.180
When you write one book, there's no problem.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.240
Because the reader doesn't know how it's going to come out.

42:03.500 --> 42:08.840
But when you have a series, the reader says, well, hey, look, you know, he's been through 18 of these adventures.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.980
Now he's emerged unscathed from everyone.

42:11.100 --> 42:12.680
So why worry?

42:13.200 --> 42:16.520
And you know, the reader's emotional involvement in the story is lessened.

42:16.740 --> 42:23.860
But when there is a real danger, when people near and dear to him are dying, and in some cases dying horribly,

42:25.440 --> 42:28.700
it brings the threat much closer, makes it much more plausible.

42:30.640 --> 42:35.000
And at this point McGill has lost a lot of people who are very close to him.

42:35.760 --> 42:40.420
His parents, Nadia and Grace Dean, he's going to lose more.

42:41.940 --> 42:51.620
You know, as I say, part of it is cold calculation, but part of it is also realistic appraisal of the situation being him.

42:52.320 --> 43:00.220
He's got this talent, he's got this mysterious link with this even more mysterious alien being,

43:00.540 --> 43:02.480
and he has people hot on his trail.

43:05.320 --> 43:15.520
And it streams, you know, reader's credibility to have not only Dean, but all his friends coming to you safe and sound every time.

43:16.280 --> 43:20.520
You know, the organization, they may not be perfect, but they're not total amateurs,

43:21.060 --> 43:23.760
and they're going to be striking real close to home.

43:25.580 --> 43:30.100
And they have so far in the first three books and they'll continue to.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.360
Makes a lot of sense.

43:33.700 --> 43:39.920
The other thing I really enjoyed is McGill's Misadventures with Gina McCarrie.

43:40.540 --> 43:46.760
Does that come from personal experience? I mean, it's really frustrating to read this poor guy going through all this.

43:46.940 --> 43:48.260
Of course, it brings back memories too.

43:48.660 --> 43:54.840
Yeah, I think anybody who's ever been a teenage boy can identify with a lot of McGill and Gina.

43:54.840 --> 44:01.080
Yeah, much of it comes from personal experience.

44:01.240 --> 44:06.780
The feelings of awkwardness and the way things just never click with someone you want them to.

44:11.860 --> 44:18.400
Okay, so you say you have about seven more books in mind.

44:18.680 --> 44:21.000
Are you working on other things simultaneously?

44:21.440 --> 44:24.280
Is this going to be your output for the next few years?

44:24.280 --> 44:37.360
No, I'm going to keep on doing what I've been doing, which is write a fan book and then a non-fan, back and forth.

44:37.920 --> 44:44.220
Seriously, some people seem to be able to just sit down and write book after book of their series character.

44:46.120 --> 44:57.500
I can't do that after I wrote Lava right after finishing, I think it was the fourth draft of Reef.

44:58.180 --> 45:01.520
And by the end of Lava, I was ready to kill McGilfian.

45:01.860 --> 45:08.200
If I had to write a fourth McGilfian right then, it would have been flung into the summer on page one and I would have been it, you know, the end.

45:11.300 --> 45:18.880
So I plan to alternate Fian books with things more in line with the Anderson and Schnazschmake lines for a commission.

45:19.860 --> 45:26.500
I'm working on one of them right now in fact, which is driving me absolutely crazy and making me look forward to seeing all the more.

45:29.580 --> 45:32.520
Okay, that about does it. I was going to make a couple of comments.

45:32.520 --> 45:48.820
One is that the Fian books remind me now, take this as a compliment because I'm a farmer fan, but remind me a little bit of Venus on the half shell, kind of the humor and the slug at the front that's the God and that sort of thing.

45:48.980 --> 45:56.280
It reminded me just of the tone of that, not the story, but anyway, it was reminiscent of that, which I really enjoyed it a long time ago.

45:57.140 --> 45:57.980
I will take that.

45:59.040 --> 46:04.580
The other thing I want to ask you just well, the interview is over.

46:04.900 --> 46:05.280
Okay.

46:05.660 --> 46:09.720
The other thing I want to ask you and I will tell you this at the end that didn't want to tell you at the front.

46:09.880 --> 46:27.380
Okay, whenever you're whenever better snatch first came out and I saw the name and said Kevin O'Donnell Jr.

46:27.380 --> 46:28.800
And I really avoided it.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.980
I mean, those books weren't terrible, but it wasn't it wasn't worth picking up.

46:32.980 --> 46:37.160
And I wondered if anybody else had ever mentioned to you that they thought you were Barry Maltzberg at first.

46:37.440 --> 46:42.020
The entire world has mentioned to me that they thought I was Barry Maltzberg.

46:46.280 --> 46:48.280
I'm sort of a difficult name to shake.

46:51.140 --> 47:00.440
Barry first used that pseudonym because he was working as a literary agent and couldn't have his output appear under his own name at the time.

47:01.160 --> 47:08.740
And he picked it as sort of an homage to Cutner Moore, who wrote under the pen name Lawrence O'Donnell.

47:09.400 --> 47:13.300
So he took their initials to their last names and used O'Donnell.

47:13.460 --> 47:24.300
Well, I came along four years later and everybody thought I was some kind of either a rip-off artist or Barry using yet another pseudonym.

47:25.980 --> 47:29.560
But but KMO Donnell has caused me a lot of grief.

47:29.560 --> 47:39.120
In fact, after I left Korea and went to college, my mother, my subscription to FNSF was still going out to Korea.

47:41.100 --> 47:47.060
And a very depressing, nasty KMO Donnell story showed up in FNSF.

47:47.480 --> 47:50.680
My mother tore it out of the magazine and sent it to me.

47:50.680 --> 47:53.620
I said, scribble on it, is this you?

47:54.220 --> 47:59.300
You know, when I had to write back, no mom, that's not me, that somebody else is using my name, but really it's not me.

48:00.600 --> 48:04.180
Since then I've had people come up and say, are you Barry Maltzberg's son?

48:04.580 --> 48:05.580
You know, what is this?

48:07.700 --> 48:11.000
It's been bothering me now for going on ten years.
