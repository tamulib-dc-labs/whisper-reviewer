Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.300
And here are your hosts.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.060
This is Daryl Lane.

00:45.180 --> 00:45.820
And Bill Vernon.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.940
Clifford Simac is a veteran science fiction writer who has been producing short stories and novels continuously since 1938.

00:52.600 --> 01:02.620
Simac won the International Fantasy Award for his city series, Hugo Awards for his stories at the big front yard, and the Grotto of the Dancing Deer, and the novel Way Station.

01:02.620 --> 01:07.140
And he was honored by his peers when they presented him with the Grandmaster Nebula Award.

01:07.720 --> 01:13.900
Simac's prolific output is remarkable when one learns that until his retirement a few years ago, he was a full-time newspaper man.

01:14.460 --> 01:16.780
We asked him how he decided to become a newspaper man.

01:17.540 --> 01:21.200
There was no decision because I think I'll always do what I want to write.

01:24.520 --> 01:30.240
And I never really thought of writing fiction or writing books or anything of that sort.

01:31.220 --> 01:35.120
It seemed to me that the way to write was to be a newspaper man.

01:37.560 --> 01:45.620
My mother, who was a very well-educated woman, had books in the house all the time, and I read them.

01:46.620 --> 01:51.580
Now, despite the fact that we were poor, we got a daily paper.

01:54.140 --> 02:02.680
And she used to set the table by the light of a kerosene lamp and read it each evening after all the work was done.

02:03.740 --> 02:16.220
And I asked her at one time, I remember, if a newspaper carried all the news, printed all the news that it was, and she, in that manner of that day,

02:17.500 --> 02:22.960
and because people were not as cynical as they are now, said, yes, that was true.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.860
And I asked her another question that I thought was important.

02:28.400 --> 02:34.220
I said, is all the news true? Is what the newspaper writes true?

02:34.760 --> 02:40.900
And again, with that rikocineticism and faith that the people of that time had, she said yes, it was.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.580
And that decided me to want to be a newspaper man.

02:47.660 --> 02:54.840
So Simac did become a newspaper man, but eventually he found that the type of writing it required did not completely satisfy him.

02:55.220 --> 02:59.060
We asked him why he chose science fiction when he decided to write fiction.

02:59.920 --> 03:15.340
Because when I was a boy, I had read Tewesburn and I think H.G. Wells, although I don't actually remember any H.G. Wells works, but I must admit them,

03:15.900 --> 03:18.820
like Alan Poe and Haggard.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.000
And I thought what a wonderful thing that was.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.160
I just had no interest in the field.

03:30.440 --> 03:35.220
I wanted to read it myself and I found out when I decided that I wanted to write,

03:35.500 --> 03:41.700
when I found out that newspaper didn't give me everything that I wanted in the writing field.

03:42.540 --> 03:53.460
I decided that on parts of my spare time, my right, I naturally seemed to turn to science fiction because it was something I was quite a wits.

03:54.420 --> 03:58.060
I felt very sure that I could do the job of it.

03:58.900 --> 04:03.240
And I was quite fortunate of course because there was no competition at that time.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.680
If you could string in three sentences together and make a paragraph, somebody would buy the story.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.800
The End

04:20.900 --> 04:24.380
CIMAC's combination of professions is, on the surface, a strange mixture.

04:25.080 --> 04:30.700
After all, newspaper writing requires a lean, straightforward type of prose, whereas fiction requires much fuller writing.

04:31.340 --> 04:34.560
We asked CIMAC if he thought the styles required are significantly different.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.100
They are absolutely opposite.

04:39.060 --> 04:47.000
But I compartmentalized my wife into two lives.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.840
When I went to work in the morning, I was the newspaper man.

04:53.140 --> 04:59.560
And when I came home and sat down at my desk at night, I was a fiction writer.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.160
More on Clifford CIMAC in our next show.

05:10.620 --> 05:19.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:06.540 --> 06:10.660
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.040
The End

06:27.040 --> 06:32.200
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.620
And here are your hosts.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.580
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

06:43.800 --> 06:49.140
Science fiction writer Clifford CIMAC has been publishing almost continuously every year since 1938.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.560
Right, but CIMAC's first stories were published several years earlier.

06:53.100 --> 06:56.560
Here he explains how his writing career got started and how it was temporarily stopped.

06:57.560 --> 07:09.400
I started my newspaper career in 1929 and my first short story appeared in, I think, 1931.

07:11.400 --> 07:16.600
And at that time I wrote several other short stories which were published.

07:18.140 --> 07:30.520
And at about that time the magazine, the all magazines, the Science Fiction magazines and all others, ran at a hard time because the Great Depression came along.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.100
And so I, there was no market, practically no market.

07:37.860 --> 07:47.800
So I dropped out and didn't do any more writing, any other fiction writing at any time until I think it was 37 or 38.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.860
And I started writing again because the magazines had come back.

07:53.660 --> 08:02.760
John Camel had been named editor of a Stounding and I felt fairly sure that I could sell my work to John Camel.

08:03.640 --> 08:14.920
So I started him again and I think since 1938 and 1939, I think it's 38, 37 or 38.

08:15.840 --> 08:20.820
There was only one year in which none of my work appeared.

08:21.260 --> 08:28.340
There was one year that's blank and I can't remember which year that it was and I have no idea why that occurred.

08:39.900 --> 08:45.700
So CIMAC became an early mainstay in John W. Campbell's Stable of Writers at Astounding Stories.

08:46.180 --> 08:48.780
We asked CIMAC why he thought his work appealed to Camel.

08:48.780 --> 09:08.760
I'd read a lot of John Camel's work and I knew that John Camel was a favorite of what we today call hard science fiction.

09:09.820 --> 09:13.080
And I thought that I could write that kind of science fiction.

09:13.700 --> 09:22.880
I did write what amounted to hard science fiction for some years and then begin to turn it over to the softer science fiction, such most of which we do.

09:23.880 --> 09:32.060
Well, most people write soft science fiction today only a few in their old hands and maybe a few new beginners write the hard science fiction today.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.540
During the first few decades he wrote, CIMAC produced short stories almost exclusively.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.700
We asked him to tell us why he stuck to the short story form.

09:47.540 --> 09:53.300
The short story is the training ground for the novelist.

09:54.320 --> 10:01.220
You can learn a lot more from writing a short story than you can write a novel.

10:02.240 --> 10:07.100
It's shorter to write, somewhat easier to write.

10:08.160 --> 10:12.460
You don't have the time invested in a short story to do a novel.

10:12.460 --> 10:22.540
If you spend, as a beginner, probably a six months or a year writing a novel, it fails when that's catastrophic.

10:23.740 --> 10:34.400
But during that same time you could write a half a dozen short stories and if only one of them sold, why okay, you have made a beginning.

10:35.440 --> 10:44.960
So it's the path that most people take to becoming writers or long-going works.

10:45.920 --> 10:53.460
And that doesn't apply only to the science fiction field but to any literature.

10:54.660 --> 10:57.120
More on Clifford CIMAC on our next show.

11:04.520 --> 11:13.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:54.320 --> 11:58.400
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:14.680 --> 12:20.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:22.860 --> 12:24.560
And here are your hosts.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.440
This is Daryl Lane.

12:30.540 --> 12:31.240
And Bill Vernon.

12:31.240 --> 12:36.920
Science Fiction author Clifford CIMAC has written numerous short stories and novels and he has won several awards in the field.

12:37.200 --> 12:44.980
Perhaps CIMAC's most famous and enduring work is his City Collection, a series of eight interconnected stories written in the 1940s.

12:45.240 --> 12:52.640
These stories featured mankind's reaction to a new situation and man's relationship with an old friend, the dog, and a new one, the robot.

12:53.240 --> 12:57.060
CIMAC agreed when we called these stories a leap from his previous efforts.

12:58.060 --> 13:08.200
It was a leap because I always regard the city stories as a sort of watershed of my writing.

13:08.820 --> 13:17.900
I have been writing the old type of science fiction work up until then.

13:18.800 --> 13:27.860
And it seemed to me that something better could be done than was being done.

13:28.880 --> 13:35.740
Strangely enough, at about the same time, a number of other people seemed to think the same thing.

13:37.200 --> 13:42.800
There's no accounting for something like that happening.

13:50.440 --> 13:54.220
We asked CIMAC what influenced him to write these revolutionary stories.

13:55.260 --> 14:10.780
I think it was my disillusion brought about by the war that made me write the City Series.

14:13.360 --> 14:23.640
It seemed to me that we were going through a horrible period in history and that much of human dignity had been shared away.

14:26.060 --> 14:31.320
That there was not the kind of world that we had lived in up until that time.

14:32.740 --> 14:36.220
And I was brought myself wanting to retreat from it.

14:37.320 --> 14:46.580
So I retreated from it in my mentally by going into another dimension, into another world,

14:47.820 --> 14:56.140
creating a sort of fantasy of myself and, as it turned out, others also were able to find some refuge.

14:57.620 --> 15:10.140
I think if the City Series were ripped today, that they probably would not get the attention that they got back in the early 40s,

15:11.980 --> 15:21.620
I wrote them exactly the right type of stories, exactly the right type, without knowing I was doing it.

15:32.800 --> 15:37.380
John Campbell published the first seven City Stories, but he rejected the eighth.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.380
Here CIMAC tells us of its fate.

15:39.840 --> 15:46.600
First seven were written fairly well one after the other.

15:47.980 --> 16:02.280
The eighth and final one, John Campbell turned down because he said he thought that he'd witnessed he'd published enough of that of the City Series.

16:04.000 --> 16:12.240
And so when he rejected it, I simply threw it up on the shelf and figured it was one of my rejects.

16:13.880 --> 16:20.280
And then the writer took it down and I think I sold it to amazing stories.

16:22.300 --> 16:28.260
And I don't recall what they called it, but they put it out as one of their horrible tales.

16:32.380 --> 16:39.160
And then later on when it came out, it came out, it joined the others.

16:39.160 --> 16:43.060
That was the last one that was not published by CAM.

16:44.180 --> 16:46.960
On our next show we'll talk about a ninth City Story.

16:54.360 --> 16:59.980
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:59.980 --> 17:03.240
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:36.340 --> 17:39.140
The first time I've seen a film like this, I've never seen it.

17:46.480 --> 17:50.540
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:06.640 --> 18:12.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.500
And here are your hosts.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.240
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

18:23.480 --> 18:27.880
Science fiction writer Clifford Simac's most famous work is his story collection, City.

18:28.620 --> 18:33.360
This collection of eight connected short stories was first published as a body by Nome in 1952.

18:33.620 --> 18:37.620
Here's afterwards Simac was persuaded to write a ninth City Story, Epilogue.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.680
Here he explains its genesis.

18:41.180 --> 18:43.020
Well John Camel died.

18:44.380 --> 18:51.820
And of course all of us, all of us were stricken by his death because he was a comparatively young man

18:51.820 --> 18:55.460
and appeared to be in good physical condition.

18:57.960 --> 19:06.140
Some of the writers reverenced him, I'm not too sure I reverenced him, but I felt very kindly to him,

19:06.140 --> 19:08.540
he was very badly hit by his death.

19:10.440 --> 19:18.000
And a group of the writers got together and said we'd have to put out a memorial to John Camel.

19:18.980 --> 19:28.680
And the best way to do it would be to put out the last issue of the oldest downing stories,

19:28.820 --> 19:31.180
not analog, but the oldest downing stories.

19:32.960 --> 19:43.500
And so they asked, I suppose there were a dozen or so people who had written for the oldest downing stories

19:43.500 --> 19:47.160
to write a story for the Memorial Lulley.

19:48.160 --> 19:57.020
And Harry Harris who was the editor told me and he said Cliff if you will write a story,

19:57.240 --> 19:59.020
I wish you'd write another City Story.

20:02.300 --> 20:13.200
And I was reluctant to do that, I should have awakened it because it had been quite a number of years since I'd written a City Story.

20:14.680 --> 20:22.360
And I knew that I had said I was a changed writer, I was not the same man as I was when I'd written the stories.

20:24.880 --> 20:34.060
I worried a great deal about the propriety of writing another City Story because I figured that the last one, the last of eight,

20:34.740 --> 20:41.760
had wound up the story of the Webster family and that there was no need to go in further.

20:43.460 --> 20:50.880
But the more I thought about it, the more I began to see that if I was going to write something for that Memorial about volume,

20:50.880 --> 20:53.120
it should be a City Story.

20:55.060 --> 21:09.180
So for the first time since I'd written them, I took down my copy of the book City and reread it, trying to catch the flavor and the spirit of the stories.

21:10.340 --> 21:21.520
And when I read the stories, I simply absolutely ached to rewrite them again because there are some awful clouties in them.

21:22.460 --> 21:31.200
But I knew even as I thought about that, that I couldn't do it because if I rewrote them, they wouldn't be a City Story.

21:32.820 --> 21:44.520
So I sat down and did my best to try to recreate the flavor of the other eight stories.

21:45.740 --> 21:51.220
I think I came very close to it, but not as satisfactorily as I'd have wanted to.

21:52.340 --> 21:56.320
Ace published the nine stories as a group for the first time in 1981.

21:56.320 --> 22:02.280
The robots in City are gentle, respectful entities. We asked Simac why he made them so.

22:03.480 --> 22:10.180
Most of the writers who had written robots before wrote of them as machines.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.620
And I wrote of them as surrogate human beings.

22:19.760 --> 22:30.760
I made them people with some of the biases and prejudices that the living human would have stripped away from them.

22:31.940 --> 22:37.080
And I tried to make them the kind of people that I would want to live with.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.800
More on Clifford Simac on our next show.

22:47.620 --> 22:56.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:58.560 --> 24:03.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:06.580 --> 24:08.260
And here are your hosts.

24:12.860 --> 24:13.940
This is Daryl Lane.

24:14.120 --> 24:14.760
And Bill Vernon.

24:15.240 --> 24:18.460
Science Fiction author Clifford Simac has been writing for more than 50 years.

24:18.680 --> 24:27.860
All his work, especially the well-known pieces such as City, A Choice of Gods, and Way Station, is characterized by a warm, sentimental flavor that never clois.

24:28.560 --> 24:33.020
Simac's Midwestern roots and values are evident in his work, and the reader is caught by their charm.

24:33.220 --> 24:36.620
We asked Simac if he purposely worked his philosophy into his works.

24:38.260 --> 24:48.880
Simac's philosophy is so much a part of him that he probably doesn't stop and think about it very often.

24:50.680 --> 24:57.520
He doesn't say, well, this is, I'm writing this way because this is the way I think, or this is the way I feel.

24:58.780 --> 25:11.680
When you sit down and write, you're writing the way you think and you feel unconsciously without trying to work at it.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.800
Not all of Simac's characters are model citizens, but none are ever terribly evil.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.220
We asked Simac why evil plays so small a role in his work.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.780
I think I've never been aware of evil.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.340
I've been aware of friendship and love.

25:40.500 --> 25:46.140
And good fellowship and honesty, truth.

25:48.240 --> 25:56.400
I get very concerned at times about the condition of the world, not only now, but in times past.

25:57.580 --> 26:04.420
And I know that there is evil, but I accept it at times late.

26:04.420 --> 26:12.220
Not consciously, but simply because I guess I didn't want to think about it.

26:14.240 --> 26:19.280
I concentrated on the things I said before on the things that seemed important to me.

26:26.940 --> 26:33.460
Did Simac ever dream back in his early writing days that science fiction would become a fixture in commercial literature?

26:50.420 --> 26:57.600
When you met somebody and they found out you were science fiction writers, they'd say, how to get those crazy ideas.

26:59.020 --> 27:02.380
And you were thinking around, hoping nobody would notice you.

27:05.440 --> 27:09.320
You were the bottom of the heap. There's no question about it.

27:10.340 --> 27:17.140
You were much more despicable than maybe the pornographic writers of today.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.460
But we kept at it because we liked it.

27:24.540 --> 27:33.140
I think after a few years of it, I'd begin to feel that probably it would develop in my head's future.

27:35.260 --> 27:46.180
But I never think that we would be putting out as great and good a progress as we have.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.620
How does Simac want to be remembered as a writer?

28:21.000 --> 28:25.740
