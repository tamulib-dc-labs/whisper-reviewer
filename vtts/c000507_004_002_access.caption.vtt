00:01.260 --> 00:13.660
No, you can sit over here. Okay, the tape is on. We have a visitor tonight, my
wife, who read the book and loved it, so she wanted to sit in and listen. Oh,

00:13.680 --> 00:27.600
fine. See what an author sounds like. Okay, as I said, the tape is on. Why a
novel featuring both vampires and the Mississippi Riverboat era? Well, I could

00:27.600 --> 00:36.920
say why not, but that would be evading the issue. Essentially, the vampires came
first in my own personal...

00:39.860 --> 00:48.360
The vampires came first as I was putting the book together. I had read a fair
amount about vampires. I had read other people's vampire novels as far as

00:48.360 --> 00:58.720
Dracula and some of the other books done recently, and I had wanted to do my own
version of that legend for some time because I had a few ideas about it. But I

00:58.720 --> 01:08.440
didn't want it to be just another Dracula book, just another rehash of the same
old legend, because we've seen vampire books after vampire books that are

01:08.440 --> 01:16.680
essentially just the same thing spun over and over again, and I think that's a
little tiresome. And at the same time I was going through all these talks about

01:16.680 --> 01:26.460
vampires was the period that I was living in Dubuque, Iowa. I taught college
there for three years, and Dubuque, of course, is an old river town. It was once

01:26.460 --> 01:36.100
a big steamboat manufacturing center, and it's still very much imbued with the
whole history of the great era of steam on the Mississippi. So it was during

01:36.100 --> 01:46.020
that period while I was in Dubuque that I got interested in that period of
history. I got interested in the steamboats. I read a fair amount about them,

01:46.020 --> 01:58.980
and once I did, the two things just seemed to come together in my mind. There's
a certain romanticism, I think, a dark romanticism that clings to both the old

01:58.980 --> 02:11.440
steamboats and vampires. They're both very attractive in a certain sense, the
elegant vampire and the stately, intricate, gorgeous steamboat, but they also

02:11.440 --> 02:19.320
have dark sides, too, of course. It's obvious in the case of the vampire. In the
case of the steamboat, they were very dangerous most of travel. They were always

02:19.320 --> 02:32.440
blowing up, and boiler explosions, fires, having a bomb torn out by the river.
It was a tumultuous time, and the river towns were rough, dangerous places. You

02:32.440 --> 02:43.700
had towns like Natchez-on-the-Hill, for example, which are Natchez-on-the-Hill,
the kind of double city of Natchez that existed at that time and is referred to

02:43.700 --> 02:56.660
in the book. It seems to me that's an almost literal metaphor for the vampirism,
the two natures, good and bad, together in one entity.

03:01.000 --> 03:13.000
Why do you think vampires are so attractive to people? Through the years they've
been popular, and it seems like now they're really popular. Why is that? That's

03:13.000 --> 03:14.020
an interesting question.

03:17.400 --> 03:28.380
Vampires are an almost universal legend, which is one thing that turned out when
I was researching Fever Dream. The vampires we're familiar with, of course,

03:28.540 --> 03:39.420
Dracula and his kin, so to speak, and all the books that are derived from that
tradition are essentially retreads of Eastern European, Romanian, Hungarian,

03:39.420 --> 03:50.380
largely vampire legends. But if you look around the world, you'll find vampire
legends everywhere. In China, in Africa, in the South Seas, there are variants

03:50.380 --> 04:02.760
of the vampire legend. The details differ, but the basic vision of a nocturnal
predator that preys on human beings is present in all of these. And so that

04:02.760 --> 04:14.560
would lead you to wonder why do they have this universal appeal? The easy answer
as to why they're appealing in our culture today, in modern American mass

04:14.560 --> 04:30.100
society, I think is the sexual nature of the vampire. The sexual symbolism
embodied in Dracula and in the way it's been treated by Hollywood, the symbolism

04:30.100 --> 04:31.800
of vampire as seductor

04:35.040 --> 04:35.720
is...

04:39.620 --> 04:51.960
appeals to something within us and gives legend a lot more resonances than, say,
the werewolf legend or zombies or some of the other things that have never

04:51.960 --> 05:04.060
really achieved the popularity of the vampire legend. But... then you could say,
well, that's true for us, but it doesn't explain why the legend is so universal

05:04.060 --> 05:11.840
around the world. And indeed it doesn't, but I don't have an answer to that. In
the terms of fever dream, I looked at that universality and I made it one of the

05:11.840 --> 05:20.280
bases when I started writing the novel. I said, what if the reason that these
legends are universal is because they're all remembering the same thing? They're

05:20.280 --> 05:34.080
all remembering some kind of racial memory of a real man-like predatory animal,
blood drinker, that is somehow the basis for all the vampire legends. And that

05:34.080 --> 05:44.940
was the premise that I, of course, used in fever dream. You incorporated some of
the traditional vampire elements such as they couldn't come out in the middle of

05:44.940 --> 05:53.520
the day. But yet some of the others, they couldn't see their... well, you
couldn't see their images in a mirror, the fear of silver, I assume garlic was

05:53.520 --> 06:01.880
out, whatever. Was this kind of a conscious sifting through the vampire
traditions and settling on ones that seemed reasonable and others that just

06:01.880 --> 06:10.380
seemed like they would just be fantasy or hearsay about vampires? Yeah, more or
less. I wanted to have rationalized vampires. I wanted to have vampires that I

06:10.380 --> 06:21.500
thought could actually just... that were not based on, on, you know, vague
supernatural legends handed down over the years. So I had to look at each of the

06:21.500 --> 06:31.580
particular beliefs associated with vampires and see, is there any way that I
could justify this in a rational manner? Now, obviously, something about

06:31.580 --> 06:41.580
vampires not coming out during day, which the vampires in my book, Fever Dream,
do have that characteristic. Well, that's very easily explainable. It's just...

06:42.260 --> 06:56.040
They're nocturnal creatures. Their skin is extremely sensitive to ultraviolet,
so they burn very badly if they're exposed to daylight. So they avoid it. You

06:56.040 --> 07:03.680
can justify that easily. But you look at something that's not reflected in
mirrors. I mean, there's no way to justify not being reflected in mirrors

07:03.680 --> 07:13.020
scientifically. You have to rewrite, essentially, all the laws governing light
and reflection and refraction and so on. That's strictly a supernatural motif,

07:13.020 --> 07:21.800
so I had to get rid of that. Obviously, considering that the book is about
vampires on Mississippi River steamboats, I had to get rid of the one that said

07:21.800 --> 07:26.940
they can't cross running water as well since they sail up and down the steamboat
all through the book.

07:30.580 --> 07:40.160
Your concept of the red thirst, which came upon the vampires periodically, was
something I had not run into before in vampire legends. That, again, I would

07:40.160 --> 07:52.460
assume was part of the rationalizing their existence in this world as opposed to
just the fantasy vampires. More or less, yeah. And it was also part of what I

07:52.460 --> 07:54.420
was trying to do with Fever Dream thematically.

07:56.860 --> 08:05.480
I suppose, as much as anything else, I mean, the book is about vampires on
Mississippi River steamboats, but in a deeper sense, it's about moral choices.

08:05.980 --> 08:16.300
And one of the things that Joshua York, the vampire, says to Abner, Abner Marsh,
the protagonist, and that Abner later says back to him, is, you make your

08:16.300 --> 08:28.380
choices. We all make our choices. If you take the traditional vampire thing, the
traditional vampire beliefs, the traditional vision of the vampire, you don't

08:28.380 --> 08:35.740
have choice. The vampire is an avatar of undying, ancient, and absolutely black
evil.

08:38.680 --> 08:49.620
Well, okay, fine, that makes for good entertainment, but as it interacts with
the real world, it's kind of a hollow construct. The real world is made up of

08:49.620 --> 08:58.680
greys. I mean, real people are made up of greys. We don't have absolute goods,
and we don't have absolute evils. The good and evil that we have, you know,

08:58.740 --> 09:09.440
resides in each of us, and it is a matter of moral choice. So that's why the
book is constructed around four characters, two human beings and two vampires,

09:10.860 --> 09:25.200
but issues of good and evil are not easily broken down. There are good human
beings and good vampires in the terms of the book, and there is a bad vampire,

09:25.380 --> 09:35.660
an evil vampire, but also an evil human being. So the four characters of the
four major characters, Abner, Joshua, Damon Julian, and Sour Billy Tipton all

09:35.660 --> 09:47.300
kind of reflect and interact with each other in what I hope are interesting
ways. When did Julian make his choice? Just eons ago, or did he ever really

09:47.300 --> 09:57.140
think about making a choice as far as this moral choice? Well, he did make a
choice eons ago, but he also makes the choice in terms of the book at the

09:57.140 --> 10:01.020
banquet when he essentially rejects what Joshua has to offer

10:04.600 --> 10:18.080
and states his opposition to Joshua with saying, you know, we are born, this is
what we are born to be, masters of humanity, people who take the lives of those

10:18.080 --> 10:30.100
inferior to us, and this is our nature. So he is making a choice there. He's
rejecting Joshua's potion, he's rejecting the freedom from the red thirst that

10:30.100 --> 10:43.900
Joshua offers, and he's accepting what he thinks is of his superior nature. Of
course, there's also certain, you know, resonances there with the whole slavery

10:43.900 --> 10:55.120
thing, which I tried to put through all the way through the book. It takes place
in the antebellum south, late antebellum south, and the slavery issue, of

10:55.120 --> 11:05.600
course, is very hot then, and the whole master-slave thing that existed between
blacks and whites in the south then has a kind of fantasy reflection in

11:05.600 --> 11:18.880
relations between vampires and human beings. Captain Marsh was a character that
I really liked, and I think he's one of the strongest characters you've come up

11:18.880 --> 11:29.520
with in your writing. Did he occur to you early, or did he occur to you as you
started doing the research and were looking for a strong protagonist? Well, like

11:29.520 --> 11:40.380
any character, I think in a work of fiction like a novel, Abner Marsh just grew.
I mean, I had the basic outlines of the character when I started the book, but

11:40.380 --> 11:48.080
the more you write about him, the more you learn and get to know the character,
and you go back later and you do subsequent drafts, changing some of the stuff

11:48.080 --> 12:02.740
that goes earlier on. By the time I finished Fever Dream, I was thoroughly
enraptured with Abner, who was a character that I liked very much also, and I'm

12:02.740 --> 12:18.060
glad he came across as well. There are certain real riverboat captains who were
loose models for Abner Marsh, but he's not modeled strictly on any one person. I

12:18.060 --> 12:29.940
took a couple characteristics from one famous steamboat captain and a couple
from another, and just a couple from other people that I knew, and sort of mixed

12:29.940 --> 12:31.640
them together and came up with Abner.

12:39.260 --> 12:51.400
Okay. One thing, you mentioned Captain Marsh and then the slavery. I thought one
thing that made it effective was Captain Marsh's essential neutrality towards

12:51.400 --> 13:02.420
slavery, and then things kind of slowly dawned on him. He wasn't up on a
soapbox, either pro or against, so it didn't come across as preachy, and that

13:02.420 --> 13:16.440
was appreciated by the reader, definitely. Oh, thank you. Well, of course, that
was the intention, that Marsh's exposure to Joshua, and exposure to the whole

13:16.440 --> 13:21.360
night folks, as he calls them, or vampires,

13:23.880 --> 13:36.640
changes him. It makes him a much different man at the end than at the beginning.
Abner Marsh is never an evil man. I think by nature he is a good man, but he is

13:36.640 --> 13:47.240
a man at the beginning of the book who is essentially just living his own life,
and the great moral issues of his time, like slavery, are things he kind of

13:47.240 --> 13:52.700
hashes out over the dinner table, but never has any great personal involvement
in.

13:55.820 --> 14:04.260
But as a result of the whole experience with the steamer fever dream and the
things that happen to him, I think Marsh changes and becomes, in essence, a man

14:04.260 --> 14:06.940
who is much more aware of the necessity to make moral choices.

14:10.940 --> 14:24.400
Fever dream is a storehouse of old historical fact and descriptions and that
sort of thing. I assume you spent a lot of time researching this before you

14:24.400 --> 14:36.720
actually sat down to write it. I did about, it took me two years to do fever
dream altogether. The first year of that was largely research. I did not

14:36.720 --> 14:49.640
research it, you know, eight hours every day, but I was still teaching at the
Buick during the period where I actually began the research, but I did a fair

14:49.640 --> 14:58.960
amount of it and as I said, it did take me a year. I read considerably in the
field. I traveled on as many of the existing steamboats as I could, those that

14:58.960 --> 15:09.500
still fly the Mississippi River system. And I went to various cities where
scenes from the book take place, St. Louis, New Orleans, Louisville, and so

15:09.500 --> 15:19.260
forth, and visit the steamboat museums there, walk the streets to get a little
feel of, especially in the older sections of town like the French Quarter in New

15:19.260 --> 15:31.480
Orleans. So a lot of research did go into it, yes. I think that's a necessity if
you're going to do justice to any sort of historical fiction. Fever Dream, of

15:31.480 --> 15:44.480
course, is historical horror, but I still think you owe your readers that debt
of accuracy insofar as you're capable of it. Was there ever a riverboat as grand

15:44.480 --> 15:59.360
as the Fever Dream? Oh, yeah. The dimensions of the Fever Dream and the capacity
of her engines and so forth are modeled very closely on the Eclipse. In terms of

15:59.360 --> 16:10.080
the book, the Eclipse is the queen of the river, the fastest, largest, and most
luxurious boat, and it's the one Abner Marsh aspires to displace as fastest

16:10.080 --> 16:23.300
steamer on the river, and that's why it built the Fever Dream. The Eclipse was a
real historical boat of its era, the 1850s, and was considered the fastest boat

16:23.300 --> 16:27.680
of that era, did indeed win a very famous steamboat race against the Shotwell,

16:30.280 --> 16:40.300
and some people, including Mark Twain, put forward evidence that the Fever Dream
was, in fact, the fastest steamer ever on the river. And there were later

16:40.300 --> 16:51.340
steamers in the 1870s and the 1880s that, while they were not perhaps as fast as
the Fever Dream in the book or the Eclipse in real life, were even more

16:51.340 --> 16:51.980
luxurious,

16:54.660 --> 17:02.660
like the J.M. White, a very fast and incredibly luxurious steamer of the 1870s,
1880s.

17:05.760 --> 17:16.800
I was surprised at the lack of longevity of steamboats. They just didn't last
very long, did they? No, they didn't. That was one of the interesting things

17:16.800 --> 17:25.580
that turned up when I was researching it that kind of startled me, too. I mean,
they're such formidable-looking structures. You'd think they'd be around for

17:25.580 --> 17:29.120
ages, but, in fact,

17:32.440 --> 17:36.280
they had a shorter lifespan than the modern car.

17:39.380 --> 17:43.100
Hold on a second. Someone's at my door. Can you turn off the recorder a second?
No problem.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.200
Hello? Bill? Yes, sir. Here I am now. Okay, the tape is back on.

18:05.180 --> 18:15.600
Fever Dream, as I recall, is what they used to call a stretch of the river. Was
that a town? For some reason, it escapes me. I didn't write this down. What

18:15.600 --> 18:26.480
Fever Dream was before the book, where he got the name? Oh, well, I guess I'll
ask his dad. Well, Christy, the title of the book is taken from the name of the

18:26.480 --> 18:34.320
steamboat in the book. The Fever Dream is named the steamboat. And the reason
Avner Marsh names the steamboat the Fever Dream is because it is the boat he has

18:34.320 --> 18:44.400
always dreamed of having, the grand, luxurious, fast steamer, and because he is
the president. His company is called Fever River Package Company, with that odd

18:44.400 --> 18:59.100
spelling, the R-E inverted. He was born in Galena, Illinois. And the river,
Galena, is located on a small tributary that comes off the Mississippi, which

18:59.100 --> 19:11.940
originally was named the Fever River, F-E-V-R-E River, in the early 1800s. And
Marsh, of course, was born during that period and grew up calling it. In point

19:11.940 --> 19:23.860
of fact, and this is all historically true, the name of that river was changed
to Galena River fairly early on because the town got respectable and they didn't

19:23.860 --> 19:30.620
want people thinking they were all sick there. So they thought it would be
better to call it the Galena River. But Galena was a very important steamboat

19:30.620 --> 19:39.820
town and the Fever in its early days, today it's nothing but a creek. It's
completely silted up and I've visited it and you couldn't get a rowboat up it,

19:39.940 --> 19:52.440
let alone a major steamer. But in the early 1800s, Galena was a major steamboat
port and the Fever or the Galena River, as it later became, was a very bustling

19:52.440 --> 20:00.240
little tributary indeed. And a lot of traffic went up and down it. There was no
real Fever River Packet Company however.

20:03.840 --> 20:14.360
I heard in Lubbock George Proctor talking to you about the cover of the book. He
said it wouldn't help sell the book. I guess I'll ask, first of all, does an

20:14.360 --> 20:24.400
author have any say-so in a cover? Second of all, does it really matter? And
thirdly, what did you think of the cover of Fever Dream? First of all, does the

20:24.400 --> 20:35.300
author have any say-so? The author has minimal say-so. They will ask the author
for advice in some cases. I'd say maybe once out of four times they'll ask the

20:35.300 --> 20:43.280
author. But that doesn't mean they pay any attention to anything the author
might say after they ask him. In the case of Fever Dream, I think it's the best

20:43.280 --> 20:52.340
cover I've ever gotten. I think George is absolutely dead wrong in that. It's a
wonderful cover. I have the original art, which I've purchased now hanging on my

20:52.340 --> 21:01.880
wall. It is an inaccurate cover in one respect. The steamboat that is portrayed
on the cover is a stern wheeler when the fever dream in the book is a side

21:01.880 --> 21:10.660
wheeler, which was much more common. The side wheelers were the class boats of
the river. But it's still a marvelously executed cover, I think. And lovely,

21:13.200 --> 21:21.940
subtle, the kind of ghost boat look and the reflection of a vampire in the
water. And as for not selling the book, well, the book is already in its second

21:21.940 --> 21:31.200
printing and seems to be doing very well. It's gotten the best reviews I've ever
gotten in my career. So I'm very happy with the way it's selling so far. Great.

21:32.460 --> 21:36.760
Are you a fan of Lord Byron by any chance? Yeah.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.960
Byron and Shelley, the Romantics.

21:45.720 --> 21:56.160
Okay. You mentioned that you had started working on this book when you were in
Dubuque. How did it fit in with the writing of the other books that have come

21:56.160 --> 22:04.840
out? Did you weave its writing in and out with them? Do you tend to write books
one at a time? No, I write books one at a time, but the publishing industry

22:04.840 --> 22:13.820
publishes them slowly, which is something that I guess many readers don't
realize. I was in Dubuque from 1976 through 1979.

22:18.500 --> 22:35.360
I began work on Fever Dream, began researching it late in 1978. So for the last
month or so of 1978 and for most of 1979, I devoted to research on Fever Dream

22:35.360 --> 22:48.380
while I was teaching. I actually sat down and began writing Fever Dream right at
the end of 1979, around December or so. And I, 1980, I moved to Santa Fe.

22:48.620 --> 22:57.260
Actually, it was very, like, Christmas, 1979, I moved to New Mexico. And my
first year here was essentially just devoted to work on Fever Dream. I finished

22:57.260 --> 23:08.660
it late in 1980. That was when it was sold. And it has been two years in the
making, during which period I have gone on and written other books. The

23:08.660 --> 23:18.280
publisher, was it Poseidon? Poseidon Press. Yeah. How are they related to the
other presses? Poseidon Press is, uh... Well, Poseidon Press is essentially a

23:18.280 --> 23:29.720
new imprint of, uh, Pocketbook Simon & Schuster. So, it's a... Although it bears
Poseidon Press imprint, it is edited by editors, Pocketbook's editors, and

23:29.720 --> 23:39.800
distributed through to Simon & Schuster's sales reps. The whole
interrelationships of imprints and publishers is, uh, perhaps too complicated

23:39.800 --> 23:49.240
and not sufficiently interesting to go into. So, uh, the major thing for people
seeking to book to know is that, uh, Fever Dream is, it's a Poseidon Press

23:49.240 --> 24:02.780
hardcover and distributed through Simon & Schuster can be obtained through them.
Um, any, uh, sequels or prequels, uh, for the future? I've had several people

24:02.780 --> 24:12.120
suggest sequels to me. Uh, I have no immediate plans for doing any. No, I think
the story, um, finishes when it finishes. But I wouldn't rule them out

24:12.120 --> 24:23.260
completely. Obviously, the type of vampires exist in the book. I could do more
with if I chose to. I would think prequels might, uh, might almost be in order

24:23.260 --> 24:32.280
more than sequels in that, uh, you could go even earlier. However, I guess Marsh
is out. Uh, he would be, uh, he would be an interesting case. Maybe you could

24:32.280 --> 24:44.500
write the 13 years, uh, what he did then, if you ever wanted to go back to him.
Right. Okay, one final question then, uh, I guess just more for the, uh, in

24:44.500 --> 24:56.600
general, uh, this is, uh, uh, a, more or less in the horror genre if we have to
assign genres to things. Uh, right. Why, uh, why is that genre thriving? It's, I

24:56.600 --> 25:06.260
guess more than thriving now, but that, that seems to be the biggest genre, even
bigger than romances. Um, again, uh, what, uh, what, why do people like to get

25:06.260 --> 25:08.320
scared at this particular point in history?

25:12.040 --> 25:23.920
That's an interesting question. I'm not sure I have, um, a good answer for it. I
could take a stab at it. Um, I think part of it is simply a literary phenomenon.

25:24.500 --> 25:34.840
Uh, Stephen King, uh, an enormously talented writer who, who has revolutionized
and modernized horror and made it an extremely viable form once again after

25:34.840 --> 25:45.600
decades in the doldrums. And a lot of it is, is people's response to King has
been so enormous that a lot of imitators have come in. I, I hope that I, with

25:45.600 --> 25:55.880
Fever Dream, I've, uh, done a little more than imitation. I tried to bring
something new and original to it in a deeper psychological sense beyond simply

25:55.880 --> 26:09.980
the literary and commercial success story of King. I think people may be going
to horror because it's, in horror novels we're scared, yeah, but we can kind of

26:09.980 --> 26:21.740
control the scares. And, you know, we can, we can read the book and scare
ourselves. But then we put down the book and we know that what we're afraid of,

26:21.840 --> 26:24.800
vampires, werewolves, haunted hotels, whatever,

26:27.920 --> 26:40.140
is not real. And people don't mind dealing with that and kind of getting a
little catharsis out of that. But they don't want to deal with real, the real

26:40.140 --> 26:52.580
terrifying things of violence in the streets and crime and crazed psychos out
there and the threat of nuclear holocaust and all of the other more real fears

26:52.580 --> 27:01.380
that also hang over us. So I think that may be part of it. Would you object if
somebody came along and said they wanted to make a movie out of Fever Dream? It

27:01.380 --> 27:09.600
seems like a good candidate for a movie. Well, I would love to see it made into
a movie. And we've had a fair amount of interest from Hollywood, but nothing

27:09.600 --> 27:20.880
definite. Oh, good. I envisioned Sour Billy was just Warren Oates, just straight
Warren Oates, especially at the first. Towards the end, it was more difficult to

27:20.880 --> 27:30.180
imagine it, but I could just see the whole movie. I don't know who would be
Captain Marsh, though. That would be a hard one to cast, to get somebody to gain

27:30.180 --> 27:41.760
a lot of weight. Well, I could see Ed Esner in it. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
Yeah, he would be good. Wow. Okay. Have to go back and reread it with that in

27:41.760 --> 27:52.060
mind. Do you have any questions, Susan? Okay. She doesn't want to ask any.
George, thanks very much. I enjoyed it. No, thank you. And plus, I enjoyed the

27:52.060 --> 28:01.540
book, really. It was quite good. Well, I'm glad to hear that, of course. And
thanks for doing the interview. Will you be able to send me a tape like you did

28:01.540 --> 28:09.100
on the last one? Sure. You want a tape of the Raw interview as well? No, I have
to tape of the finished product. Yeah, we'll send you a tape of the finished

28:09.100 --> 28:16.260
product. I'll probably write it up pretty quick, and we'll get a few shows out
of it, and we'll send it on to you. Yeah. Okay. When you send that to me, could

28:16.260 --> 28:24.080
you also like to include a list of the stations will be broadcast because I know
the public relations people at Simon & Schuster would like to know that. Sure.

28:24.240 --> 28:31.860
Be glad to. Okay. No problem. George, thanks again. Keep on writing. Look
forward to seeing what's coming out next. Sounds good. I'll see you at Texas

28:31.860 --> 28:36.760
Con. Great. Bye-bye now. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
