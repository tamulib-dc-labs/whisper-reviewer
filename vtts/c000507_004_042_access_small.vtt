Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.260
And here are your hosts.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.420
This is Daryl Lane.

00:43.620 --> 00:44.320
And David Carson.

00:44.700 --> 00:49.940
In 1979, two remarkable science fiction novels that seemed to share a number of amazing coincidences were published.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.840
One of the novels was The Fountains of Paradise, the Hugo Award winner for that year.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.360
Its author was British writer Arthur C. Clarke.

00:56.740 --> 00:58.160
The other was Web Between the Worlds.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.820
Its author was Charles Sheffield, also British.

01:00.820 --> 01:08.140
Besides the fact that both authors were British, both novels treated an identical theme, satellites and geosynchronous Earth orbit, or space elevators.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.800
Neither author knew that someone else was working with the same idea, but Sheffield doesn't believe it's that startling a coincidence.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.200
It's not really very surprising because the idea has been around a long time.

01:18.320 --> 01:28.680
The idea was proposed back in 1960, and I read of it in 1966, which was the first time it was published in the West.

01:29.320 --> 01:37.300
A Russian called Art Sutanov published it in 1960, but he published it in Russian in a publication that no one ever saw or heard of.

01:37.300 --> 01:45.380
But I remember the 1966 publication in Science Magazine, and thinking that's a neat idea, and putting it off in the back of my head.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.440
And presumably several others had noticed it and thought of it at the same time.

01:51.840 --> 01:57.460
And it's coincidence that Clarke and I should write the books so close together.

01:58.160 --> 02:05.280
But in a sense, if the books hadn't been written so close together, they would not both have been written.

02:05.280 --> 02:15.280
Because when somebody has written a book on a subject like that, there's a tendency for other people not to write with that same technological development.

02:16.060 --> 02:22.540
Sheffield says there was something coincidental about his discovery, before publication of either book, that Clarke had done the same thing that he had.

02:23.140 --> 02:29.800
The coincidence was that after I had reached the point where I had sent my manuscript off to Ace Books,

02:29.800 --> 02:38.480
and a friend of mine said that he'd heard that Clarke had written this book, which was then available in Galles, in which he had a space elevator.

02:39.220 --> 02:47.080
And when I read the book, I sent Clarke my manuscript, and he wrote back and said he was fascinated, but he wasn't that surprised.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.920
And when I read his book, I realized what he meant by that.

02:50.920 --> 03:00.840
What he meant was that when you get right down to it, the basic physics dictates what the structure must be like.

03:01.100 --> 03:11.160
And it's very natural to have your hero previously making a bridge, a bridge builder, because this is in a sense a bridge from the earth up to orbit.

03:11.800 --> 03:16.620
We had both, in fact, chosen heroes with very similar names.

03:16.620 --> 03:20.400
That was a coincidence. His hero was called Morgan, mine was called Merlin.

03:21.080 --> 03:26.620
And before they built the space elevator, they had both been the world's leading builder of bridges.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.220
Sheffield goes on to relate some of the less obvious similarities about the two novels.

03:31.780 --> 03:39.320
But there were some other rather strange coincidences that were not obvious from reading the books.

03:39.320 --> 03:52.740
One of them was when I was thinking of my principal character, I had as a model for him a 19th century English engineer called Brunel.

03:53.380 --> 03:58.380
Well, it turned out that Clarke actually had Brunel in his book and references to him.

03:58.720 --> 04:06.080
And that's an odd coincidence that is perhaps explained by the fact that Clarke came from England, and so did I.

04:06.080 --> 04:11.580
And we were sensitive to the English engineering tradition. That's the only way I can explain that.

04:11.780 --> 04:20.380
But there were a number of coincidences. It's not too surprising that we should write books in which the beanstalk or space elevator looked very similar.

04:20.700 --> 04:25.420
But there are other things that are a bit more surprising than that.

04:26.340 --> 04:34.460
But as one of my characters, it keeps on saying in a different book, the laws of probability don't just permit coincidences.

04:34.460 --> 04:41.460
They absolutely require them. And to me, it's not that surprising that Clarke and I should have written the same book at the same time.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.860
Not the same book if you follow me, but books with a similar theme.

04:46.740 --> 04:51.620
Science fiction readers should feel fortunate, coincidences are not, that both of these remarkable novels were published.

04:57.880 --> 05:06.960
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.600
The Science Fiction Radio Show is a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.160
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:17.800 --> 06:23.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.440
And here are your hosts.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.940
This is David Carson.

06:33.200 --> 06:33.880
And Daryl Lane.

06:34.120 --> 06:38.460
Charles Sheffield belongs to that small subgroup of science fiction authors who are practicing scientists.

06:39.020 --> 06:43.640
Hal Clement, Robert Forward, Fred Hoyle, and soon Carl Sagan will be some other authors in the group.

06:43.640 --> 06:51.700
Sheffield, who has a degree in theoretical physics and works for the Earth Satellite Corporation in Washington, D.C., has published such popular novels as Web Between the Worlds,

06:52.160 --> 06:55.760
Sight of Proteus, and My Brother's Keeper, in addition to numerous short stories.

06:56.180 --> 06:59.100
We asked him how he found time to be a scientist and a science fiction author.

06:59.100 --> 07:06.760
Well, I don't write as much as what my wife would call real writers write.

07:08.020 --> 07:12.020
Full-time writers should be able to produce a lot more than I do.

07:13.160 --> 07:17.100
One reason I produce as much as I do produce is because I enjoy it.

07:17.180 --> 07:19.060
I consider it a form of pleasure and relaxation.

07:20.060 --> 07:23.120
And so I do it for choice when I'm not doing other things.

07:23.760 --> 07:30.400
But I feel that if I didn't have a job, I might write a lot more, but I would probably enjoy it a lot less.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.380
And in terms of somebody who is prolific, I don't produce much at all.

07:36.780 --> 07:42.040
If you look at the productivity of, well, now I have to think of somebody who's prolific.

07:42.700 --> 07:46.940
I suppose Andy Offit has written a couple of hundred books probably.

07:48.060 --> 07:51.860
CJ Cherry produces, I think, probably three books a year.

07:52.920 --> 07:56.420
Jack Chalker produces probably five books a year.

07:57.060 --> 08:01.700
Silverberg, when he was writing full-time, produced Lord knows how many words a year.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.560
One and a half million, two million, something like this.

08:05.560 --> 08:09.700
In terms of productive people, I have a minute output.

08:10.440 --> 08:15.700
When we remark that many readers liked his fiction so well they'd wished he'd take up writing full-time and produce more of it,

08:15.700 --> 08:17.000
he had an interesting response.

08:45.700 --> 08:49.940
The definition that people use of a real writer is somebody who has to write,

08:50.120 --> 08:55.480
who will starve if they can't write, and will write even if they have to starve.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.500
I don't think that makes sense.

08:57.160 --> 09:02.500
By those terms, I don't consider I'm a real writer at all because although I like to write,

09:02.920 --> 09:06.600
it's not the top of my priority of things I want to do.

09:07.340 --> 09:10.220
And the scientific work occupies a higher slot.

09:10.220 --> 09:18.540
But Marion Zimmer Bradley said that when she had to choose between a marriage and her writing,

09:18.980 --> 09:24.100
or anything else in her writing, her writing wins, that it's the most important thing in her life.

09:24.440 --> 09:28.800
I just don't have that much attachment to it.

09:29.060 --> 09:35.600
And I think the fact that I didn't write for so long, that I started for no particular reason,

09:35.600 --> 09:43.240
after not writing for a long time, may be one of the reasons I don't consider I'm a true writer.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.520
I never felt the urge to write when I was young.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.980
I never felt that fiction was something I had to do.

09:49.400 --> 09:53.000
But many writers have that, and it dominates their lives.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.740
Finally, we asked Sheffield if he had fun writing.

09:57.420 --> 09:58.480
I think I do.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.500
I certainly love to sit down and write.

10:02.500 --> 10:06.900
I often don't have time to do it, but that's a different consideration.

10:07.580 --> 10:15.500
I find that the several things that help me, one is that I don't have to do it, that I'm doing it as a hobby.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.400
Another is that I write lots of nonfiction.

10:21.160 --> 10:25.920
And when I write nonfiction, I'm constrained in what I can think.

10:25.920 --> 10:33.360
In other words, if you're writing respectable science, you somewhat have to put yourself into an acceptable framework.

10:33.720 --> 10:39.440
And if you think outrageous thoughts, you can't really write them down, or you have to limit yourself.

10:39.780 --> 10:43.080
Whereas in fiction, you can think the most outrageous thoughts imaginable.

10:43.620 --> 10:46.880
And generally speaking, the more outrageous they are, the more people like them.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.300
So I do enjoy writing.

And here are your hosts.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.000
This is David Carson.

12:25.320 --> 12:25.940
And Daryl Lane.

12:26.160 --> 12:30.180
Marion Zimmer Bradley's latest novel is a fantasy epic that deals with the legends of King Arthur.

12:30.760 --> 12:35.340
It's entitled The Mists of Avalon, and it's recently been published in a hardcover edition by Alfred A. Knopf.

12:35.640 --> 12:41.780
There are numerous retellings of the Arthurian material. Some scholarly, some pure fantasy, but the myths of Avalon is different.

12:41.780 --> 12:53.420
In the first place, it's built around a strong thesis that the rise of Arthur as a Christian king in a male-dominated society coincided with the passing away of the old pagan religion of the Celtic Druids, which was female-oriented.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.440
And secondly, Bradley concentrates her narrative on the women of the Arthurian legends.

12:58.260 --> 13:08.900
These would include Gwinnivir, Arthur's wife and queen, Igraine, his mother, Vivianne, the Lady of the Lake, and High Priestess of Avalon, and Morgaine, or Morgan Le Fay, sorceress and wizard lady.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.120
Bradley tells us how she came to write the book.

13:11.700 --> 13:17.860
Well, all my life I've been fascinated by King Arthur, but even more I've been fascinated by Morgan Le Fay.

13:18.820 --> 13:24.400
Valerie didn't approve of her, and she's been treated as a sort of evil sorceress, quote unquote.

13:25.160 --> 13:28.540
And you can hear the capital letters all the way from Texas, I'm sure.

13:29.180 --> 13:34.000
So I started wondering who Morgan Le Fay and the Lady of the Lake really were.

13:34.000 --> 13:41.100
And there were a lot of books on the search for the historical Arthur, but I started out on the search for the historical Morgan Le Fay.

13:42.380 --> 13:44.160
How did she get into the legends?

13:44.820 --> 14:00.480
And it led me into the byways of pagan religions, into druidism, into, I don't mean the modern thing, but what Caesar wrote about, and enormous amounts of ancient, you might say, ancient culture.

14:00.480 --> 14:14.520
So I finally came up with the realization that the whole Arthurian cycle is based upon the shift from druidical and Celtic religions to Christianity,

14:15.620 --> 14:30.460
and in the Celtic culture and the Celtic mythology and the Celtic religion, women were preeminent, whereas in Christianity, St. Jerome and St. Augustine tried to convince every woman that she should be constantly doing the same thing.

14:30.460 --> 14:38.720
And St. James was a woman, and that ghastly culture shock, I think, pervaded the whole Arthurian mythos.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.300
Mallory didn't get hold of it until later.

14:42.600 --> 14:48.620
The novel is remarkable for its wealth of detail and its attention to character, both strong points in all of Mary and Zimmer Bradley's work.

14:49.080 --> 14:54.500
All of the characters from the Arthurian legends come alive in the novel, people like Merlin, Gwain and Gallahad.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.780
Lancelot is in the novel, of course, and his love of Gwunivir is sensitively handled by Bradley.

14:58.780 --> 15:01.260
Bradley talks about the ideas beneath the novel.

15:01.760 --> 15:10.900
I took one element of fantasy, the idea that as our beliefs in the world change, our world changes with it.

15:11.860 --> 15:19.900
The idea that people used to act and believe as if the world were the center of the universe, and now we know that the sun is at the center of our galaxy,

15:19.920 --> 15:25.340
but that we're way out on the edge of it, and that changes our relationship to ourselves and our world.

15:25.340 --> 15:36.680
When people believed that the source of life was just the mother, that was one belief system which very firmly and deeply pervaded their consciousnesses.

15:37.180 --> 15:46.480
And then when the idea came that the mother was incidental, that man was created in God's image and women was just a poor imitation,

15:46.700 --> 15:48.600
it must have been a monster culture shock.

15:50.160 --> 16:01.940
And so I gave the idea that the world actually changed at that time, that the religion, the idea of only having one God instead of a pantheon of God,

16:02.160 --> 16:03.880
changed people's minds.

16:04.320 --> 16:11.700
So I took one fantasy element, the idea that as these old world, as people's ideas changed, the world changed too.

16:11.700 --> 16:19.560
So the world where the elves lived sort of went into another dimension, being replaced by a world of pagan religion,

16:19.560 --> 16:25.860
and then when the world changed again, the world of pagan religion, what I call the world of Avalon, went into the mists.

16:26.560 --> 16:31.960
Anyone who likes fantasy, or anyone who enjoys reading about King Arthur, will be fascinated with the mists of Avalon.

16:32.260 --> 16:38.720
And the fascination should last for a long while too. In its hardcover format, the novel is over 800 pages. The word epic describes it well.

16:45.640 --> 16:51.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:51.300 --> 16:54.200
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
