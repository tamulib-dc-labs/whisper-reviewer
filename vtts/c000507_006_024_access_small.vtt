Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.100
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.680
And here are your hosts.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.500
This is David Carson.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.580
And Daryl Lane.

00:46.860 --> 00:50.260
For 20 years, Roger Zelazny has been writing science fiction and fantasy.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.460
He tells us why and how he became a science fiction writer.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.440
Well, it's a funny thing.

00:55.440 --> 01:05.580
I was originally a reader of science fiction from about the age of 11 through high school.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.360
And during that period, I did write a lot of science fiction stories, which I tried

01:09.360 --> 01:11.700
to sell, but I was like my early teens.

01:12.120 --> 01:17.300
And I didn't really meet any success at that point.

01:17.980 --> 01:24.000
And I decided actually before that that I wanted to be a writer.

01:24.900 --> 01:31.080
I wasn't necessarily science fiction that I had in mind, though it was science fiction

01:31.080 --> 01:33.880
stories that I was writing during the period I was reading them.

01:34.580 --> 01:38.220
When I went to college, I stopped reading science fiction, just concentrated on the

01:38.220 --> 01:39.200
material I had there.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.660
And I wrote poetry actually, exclusively.

01:43.160 --> 01:47.760
I decided that I was going to start writing again as soon as I got out of college and

01:47.760 --> 01:48.500
had some time.

01:49.180 --> 01:55.180
And at that point, I wasn't absolutely certain what it was that I would try writing, but

01:55.180 --> 02:06.920
when the opportunity finally presented itself in early 1962, I decided it might be easier

02:06.920 --> 02:12.900
for me to break into science fiction since I had read so much of it in the past, knew

02:12.900 --> 02:13.400
the area.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.560
So I decided I'd try there first.

02:15.840 --> 02:19.620
And I went out and re-familiarized myself with science fiction.

02:21.980 --> 02:24.920
And then I began writing and submitting the stories.

02:25.220 --> 02:29.120
And after about six or seven weeks, I sold my first one.

02:29.460 --> 02:33.300
And I sold 16 others that year.

02:33.540 --> 02:35.420
So I stayed with it.

02:36.360 --> 02:41.360
Zelazny has always been recognized as a stylist, a writer to whom craftsmanship is important.

02:41.800 --> 02:45.000
His characters have depth, and his prose is coherent and flexible.

02:45.460 --> 02:45.640
Right.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.420
And that's an important point to make.

02:47.820 --> 02:51.500
Science fiction has traditionally been a field in which style and character were secondary

02:51.500 --> 02:52.580
to plot and idea.

02:52.940 --> 02:57.180
Zelazny's college background in his major field of study, English, may have had some

02:57.180 --> 02:58.220
influence on his writing.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.760
As an undergraduate, I was a psychology major.

03:03.020 --> 03:07.700
And I decided I did not really want to work as a psychologist.

03:07.700 --> 03:13.120
And it occurred to me somewhere along the line that if I'm more simply going to be teaching

03:14.000 --> 03:20.180
and writing with the aim in mind of eventually writing full time, I might as well teach

03:20.180 --> 03:23.240
something that would be a little more fun than psychology.

03:23.240 --> 03:30.300
So I switched to English and took my graduate work in English and comparative literature.

03:31.600 --> 03:36.500
As a result of this background, Zelazny says, his stories had some characteristics not common

03:36.500 --> 03:37.860
to traditional science fiction.

03:38.580 --> 03:46.180
I suppose having grown up on the earlier sort of science fiction, the space opera, sort

03:46.180 --> 03:53.500
of thing of the 30s and 40s too, and the harder science stories of the 40s and some of the

03:53.500 --> 04:05.160
sociological science fiction of the 50s, and having a background in literature, I, there's

04:05.160 --> 04:09.440
a natural tendency, whether it's conscious or not, to want to do something different

04:10.000 --> 04:11.900
than things that had gone before.

04:12.840 --> 04:18.580
As a consequence, my stories, well the first ones were basically gimmick stories because

04:18.580 --> 04:21.120
it was the easiest way to break in.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.900
It was about all that I was capable of doing at the time.

04:24.060 --> 04:30.300
But when I began writing at greater length and when I was a bit sure of myself, I would

04:30.300 --> 04:31.480
think of the characters first.

04:31.480 --> 04:37.520
First, so the stories tended to have more, I suppose, in the way of psychological motivation

04:37.520 --> 04:39.640
rather than just external characterization.

04:42.040 --> 04:51.300
And my writing itself, possibly because of the years I spent writing poetry and reading

04:53.000 --> 05:01.460
general literature, tended to be a bit different from some of the earlier things which were

05:01.480 --> 05:03.380
kind of journalistic in character.

05:04.780 --> 05:06.900
More next time about Roger Zelazny.

05:14.700 --> 05:18.960
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:18.960 --> 05:23.320
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:09.220 --> 06:13.360
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:29.680 --> 06:35.220
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.720
And here are your hosts.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.460
This is David Carson.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.280
And Daryl Lane.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.580
Science Fiction authors sometimes write fantasy, and fantasy authors sometimes write science

06:50.580 --> 06:50.920
fiction.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.520
Roger Zelazny writes both.

06:52.940 --> 06:55.180
He talks about the differences between the two forms.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.620
I do make the distinction myself.

06:58.620 --> 07:06.120
In a science fiction story, everything I feel should be explainable in terms of natural

07:06.120 --> 07:10.960
laws, or extensions of natural laws as we understand them now.

07:12.180 --> 07:18.640
Whereas in a fantasy story, it's part of the rules of the game, so I feel there are

07:18.640 --> 07:25.560
no compunctions against invoking the supernatural or bringing in magic and things of that sort.

07:28.620 --> 07:34.120
And so basically a science fiction story, things are ultimately explainable in a fantasy

07:34.120 --> 07:34.600
story.

07:36.580 --> 07:39.860
They're explainable really in terms of something that isn't explainable.

07:40.440 --> 07:50.660
So you've got more, you've got the less rational background if you push things far

07:50.660 --> 07:51.820
enough in a fantasy story.

07:53.060 --> 07:56.580
So Zelazny says he writes some of his books so that they can be read either way.

07:57.860 --> 08:01.580
I also believe in mixing the two.

08:05.120 --> 08:10.620
Lord of Light, for instance, was a book where I intentionally wrote it to be taken two ways

08:10.620 --> 08:11.260
of fantasy.

08:12.280 --> 08:21.620
A fan could read it as a piece of fantasy, whereas a science fiction fan also had options

08:21.620 --> 08:22.600
available to him.

08:22.920 --> 08:29.560
Any single item which occurs in there, which is of an unusual nature, is that there's

08:29.560 --> 08:34.080
ultimately an explanation available for it if the person cares to use it.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.120
If he doesn't, that's fine too.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.680
Zelazny makes an interesting point about science fiction.

08:40.260 --> 08:44.800
He says that sometimes a science fiction story will become a fantasy story after a certain amount of time.

08:45.240 --> 08:49.180
And he uses one of his own stories, A Rose for Ecclesiastes, as an example.

08:50.820 --> 09:00.400
It's kind of funny too because I think the first story for which I became known was a piece called A Rose for Ecclesiastes.

09:05.800 --> 09:12.700
One of my reasons in writing this is because I was very fond of the earlier space operas and things like this,

09:12.780 --> 09:15.320
where they played John Carter of Mars.

09:15.320 --> 09:26.320
And I had always wanted to do something set on the Mars, which existed in these earlier stories.

09:26.440 --> 09:31.520
And I knew at the time I wrote it that it was scientifically impossible at that point.

09:31.600 --> 09:38.260
We already knew enough about Mars to know that the temperature was not the same as I had it in the story,

09:38.360 --> 09:40.800
that the atmosphere was not the same and so forth.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.820
But it was close enough to the point where this knowledge was just becoming current,

09:45.360 --> 09:49.000
that I could still get away with doing a thing like that.

09:49.240 --> 09:53.420
So I intentionally wrote that and wrote it in the fashion I did.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.960
I was a kind of exercise and nostalgia on my part.

09:59.060 --> 10:04.880
I always wanted to do a story set on that kind of Mars.

10:04.880 --> 10:08.320
And I knew that if I waited another year or so I wouldn't be able to.

10:09.240 --> 10:14.380
The same with Venus for my story, the doors of his face, the lamps of his mouth.

10:14.860 --> 10:20.420
At that point we already were aware that the surface temperature was about 900 degrees,

10:20.680 --> 10:26.660
but still there was this whole traditional body of science fiction literature,

10:26.820 --> 10:33.400
which had a vast, watery world, misty and so forth.

10:33.400 --> 10:38.660
I really had wanted to use at least once in my life, so I did those two stories

10:38.660 --> 10:40.740
as a kind of tribute to the earlier things.

10:42.760 --> 10:48.980
But then again I wrote them the way I was writing them rather than in the older style.

10:49.280 --> 10:55.120
So reading them now they'd have to be regarded as fantasy rather than science fiction

10:55.120 --> 11:01.300
because science has already demonstrated that those circumstances don't prevail.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.640
More on Roger Zelazny tomorrow.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

11:14.420 --> 11:17.120
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

11:17.120 --> 11:20.380
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

12:01.660 --> 12:06.000
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:22.160 --> 12:27.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.120
And here are your hosts.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.700
This is David Carson.

12:38.040 --> 12:38.720
And Darrell Lane.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.200
Many science fiction and fantasy authors these days write novels and series

12:42.200 --> 12:44.960
in three, four and sometimes five book sets.

12:45.420 --> 12:49.480
Jack Shocker's Well World series or Elizabeth Lynn's trilogy The Chronicles of Tornor

12:49.480 --> 12:50.520
are two good examples.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.220
It's a commercially attractive idea for one thing.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.040
If readers like the first book, then there's a ready-made market for the following ones.

12:57.040 --> 13:01.720
And of course it also allows an author the scope to pursue a theme in greater depth and length

13:01.720 --> 13:02.980
than a single book would allow.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.160
And the extra depth can give an epic quality to the series.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.080
One of the best of the series is a set of five books by Roger Zelazny,

13:10.500 --> 13:13.820
a science fantasy adventure called simply The Amber Series.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.440
The first volume is entitled Nine Princes and Amber, and it was published in 1971.

13:19.520 --> 13:25.320
The other four, The Guns of Avalon, Sign of the Unicorn, The Hand of Oberon, and the Courts of Chaos.

13:26.220 --> 13:28.980
Zelazny calls the book Something Beside Science Fantasy.

13:29.860 --> 13:34.000
Whenever I try anything of this sort, I try to give it an extra twist is what it is.

13:34.280 --> 13:44.760
Basically, I look at it myself as a kind of heroic fantasy with a few variations that don't usually occur in that sort of literature.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.620
One of the variations Zelazny develops in the books is what's called the pattern.

13:50.500 --> 13:58.740
It is a kind of archetypal design which exists in the real world,

13:59.280 --> 14:09.220
amber of which our own earth and a great variety of shadings and variations thereof exist.

14:11.440 --> 14:16.020
Amber is the real world earth and the others are referred to as shadow.

14:16.700 --> 14:27.720
Our shadow in the story is the background, the basis of reality in amber is this design called the pattern,

14:27.960 --> 14:38.380
which was inscribed by an ancestor of the clan about whom the story is told.

14:38.380 --> 14:47.480
Only a person of the blood of the royal family of amber is able to walk this pattern and not be destroyed by it.

14:47.860 --> 14:54.700
And in the course of walking the pattern at some point in his early life,

14:57.540 --> 15:02.380
amberite acquires the ability to walk through the various shadow worlds,

15:03.800 --> 15:12.380
which surround amber so that he can travel through an infinity of possibilities to virtually any world he desires.

15:13.460 --> 15:16.600
The basic plot of the series consists of a struggle for the throne of amber,

15:16.920 --> 15:22.320
and in the process our earth is threatened with destruction since we are only a shadow of the real world of amber.

15:23.380 --> 15:27.700
In the struggle the main character Corwin keeps traveling between our earth and amber.

15:27.700 --> 15:31.800
Technology doesn't work in amber so the people there fight with swords and magic.

15:32.040 --> 15:36.720
For this reason the books are called science fantasy or as Zelazny said, heroic fantasy.

15:37.240 --> 15:42.100
They've been very popular too. Zelazny says the readers have responded enthusiastically.

15:42.980 --> 15:46.940
I have gotten more fan letters on the amber books than anything else I've ever written.

15:49.340 --> 15:54.620
There was a period of a couple of years there where I was getting several letters a week on the amber books.

15:55.380 --> 15:59.800
The narrative was concluded with an exciting climax in the fifth book, The Courts of Chaos.

16:00.340 --> 16:04.800
Because of the wide reader response though, and because there were some unanswered questions in that last book,

16:05.260 --> 16:07.080
a sixth novel on amber is a possibility.

16:08.240 --> 16:13.120
There is possibly a sixth one. I have made no commitments. I do not have a plot,

16:13.520 --> 16:18.720
but I've been talking about it and thinking about it, publisher.

16:21.560 --> 16:27.940
It is possible when I get a few things out of the way that I'm writing now that I might go on into a sixth one.

16:29.460 --> 16:36.400
But so far as the five books that now exist are concerned, that story is told.

16:36.980 --> 16:44.720
That was the story I had in mind. Anything which would continue, the series would probably take off in a new direction.

16:44.860 --> 16:47.400
It could possibly be from another character's point of view.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.180
More about Roger Zelazny next time.

16:57.520 --> 17:03.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

17:03.160 --> 17:06.420
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:50.020 --> 17:54.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:10.360 --> 18:15.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:18.620 --> 18:20.200
And here are your hosts.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.520
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

18:27.160 --> 18:31.120
One of the more interesting time travel books in recent years is Roadmarks by Roger Zelazny.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.080
Though time travel is one of the traditional science fiction themes,

18:34.460 --> 18:36.320
Zelazny doesn't often write that type of story.

18:37.200 --> 18:44.560
I have always attempted to avoid time travel stories because I don't like the paradoxes involved.

18:45.340 --> 18:53.300
In fact, the only thing I can think of that I had done in the past was a short story called Divine Madness.

18:54.960 --> 19:01.020
I said that I really wouldn't write a time travel story unless I came up with a new gimmick.

19:05.280 --> 19:15.300
For Roadmarks, I thought I had something in the image of time considered as a superhighway.

19:17.460 --> 19:25.920
Without the paradoxes, in an Everett Wheeler parallel world situation,

19:26.680 --> 19:34.740
it was really the image of the road that fascinated me and led to my writing that particular book.

19:35.640 --> 19:41.000
Time is conceived as a superhighway in Roadmarks, with the exits leading to different eras throughout time.

19:41.520 --> 19:45.720
Zelazny has an interesting story to tell regarding the origin of the idea behind Roadmarks.

19:46.280 --> 19:53.080
I got the idea for that book here in New Mexico really one Sunday.

19:53.080 --> 20:02.600
I was just out for a drive and I-25, which was a nice highway type road,

20:03.840 --> 20:06.920
took a turn off and drove for a few minutes.

20:07.260 --> 20:13.100
The road rapidly degenerated until, with a matter of minutes, I was on a dirt road

20:13.560 --> 20:17.580
and I passed through a place that I couldn't even find on the map.

20:17.580 --> 20:27.320
It was a little village where there was a horse pulling a wagon and no overhead electrical lines in sight.

20:28.360 --> 20:33.620
It was almost as if I had driven back through time into the 19th century.

20:33.740 --> 20:41.220
There were log buildings and somewhere around there something started to click.

20:41.220 --> 20:46.100
As I drove back again on the road and improved until finally I was on the superhighway,

20:46.320 --> 20:56.580
I started working out just the mechanisms for the idea of driving through time, which I used in Roadmarks.

20:57.500 --> 21:04.060
Actually by the time I got home I had a number of the situations worked out and I sat down and began writing it.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.260
The protagonist is a man named Red Dorokin.

21:13.820 --> 21:16.640
He travels up and down this highway of time in a battered old pickup.

21:17.080 --> 21:20.120
And when he's not trying to avoid and outwit some assassins who are after him,

21:20.480 --> 21:23.140
he's running guns to the Greeks back in the past at Marathon.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.700
And there's something else in the book that's a recurring motif or symbol,

21:27.220 --> 21:29.520
huge dragons that float above the road occasionally.

21:29.520 --> 21:33.780
Their function is not clear, but they seem to have some responsibility for the road.

21:34.180 --> 21:43.100
They were simply to represent the dark forces, which I tend to bring in any fantasy novel.

21:43.700 --> 21:52.160
In a story like this, there has to be a point where you have to ultimately reach something that's basically unexplainable.

21:53.060 --> 21:57.320
Namely, where did the road come from and how did it come to function, the way that it did.

21:57.320 --> 22:03.480
And in making a decision on that, I could go either way.

22:03.580 --> 22:08.940
I could find some science fiction trappings and explain it,

22:09.240 --> 22:17.060
or I could leave it intentionally, something shadowy and with a more fantasy background.

22:17.220 --> 22:22.440
If I did that, I decided I needed some symbol to invoke as an ultimate creator of the road,

22:22.580 --> 22:26.080
hence the dragons, and then they're tie-in with Red.

22:26.920 --> 22:30.820
Roadmarks published in 1981 is a different sort of time travel story,

22:31.300 --> 22:34.280
tending toward the fantasy rather than the science fiction end of the spectrum.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.280
And since Roger Zelazny is responsible for it, it's highly enjoyable.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.180
And we'll have more on Roger Zelazny on our next show.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:51.140 --> 22:54.120
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:54.120 --> 22:57.340
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:41.980 --> 23:45.940
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:01.940 --> 24:07.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:10.060 --> 24:11.780
And here are your hosts.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.320
This is Darrell Lane.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.220
And David Carson.

24:18.220 --> 24:22.560
Writer Roger Zelazny has won numerous awards in the field of science fiction and fantasy,

24:22.940 --> 24:24.540
and he's been writing it for some 20 years.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.920
Zelazny has a scholarly background which often shows up in his books.

24:28.320 --> 24:32.240
The way he uses mythology, for instance, in novels like Lord of Light or This Immortal,

24:32.720 --> 24:34.600
or Psychology and the Dream Masters.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.620
He has a master's degree in literature and his knowledge of history is extensive.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.040
He's read deeply in the mythologies and early literature of mankind,

24:42.740 --> 24:46.540
and he also reads a great deal of modern literature, both science fiction and otherwise.

24:46.540 --> 24:49.680
He has some interesting ideas on science fiction and fantasy,

24:49.900 --> 24:51.200
and it's placed in the modern world.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.960
Science fiction is a special genre to him for a few basic reasons.

24:55.860 --> 25:06.440
It is, for one reason, one of the few special places where you still deal with characters

25:07.960 --> 25:14.700
other than those which occur in the modern, realistic or naturalistic novel.

25:14.700 --> 25:21.220
Going back to the critic, Northrop Fry, who spoke of characters in various modes.

25:22.060 --> 25:26.420
Science fiction is one of the few places outside of modern poetry

25:26.420 --> 25:33.800
where a writer can deal with characters in what he called the Chaimimetic or the Mythic modes.

25:34.080 --> 25:38.840
That is, characters who are greater than their fellow man, or characters who are godlike.

25:38.840 --> 25:46.040
Sometimes in that science fiction does deal with mutants and aliens and sentient computers

25:46.040 --> 25:49.500
and cyborgs and robots.

25:49.720 --> 25:54.180
What have you, just old categories of beings which are different than the characters you meet with

25:54.180 --> 25:56.480
in a naturalistic or realistic novel.

25:56.980 --> 26:00.480
So in that sense, and I think this is one of the great virtues of science fiction,

26:00.720 --> 26:04.600
it gives the writer more scope for exploration in terms of character.

26:16.120 --> 26:16.660
Science fiction is one of the few places where you can deal with characters in a naturalistic or realistic way.

26:16.660 --> 26:19.480
Besides the freedom or scope that science fiction provides for a writer,

26:19.980 --> 26:25.020
it also has one other quality that Zelazny feels differentiates it from general or mainstream literature.

26:26.140 --> 26:32.280
I think that science fiction is still basically for all of the experimentation that went on in the 60s,

26:32.280 --> 26:34.860
a bastion of storytelling.

26:36.200 --> 26:46.660
The idea is not necessarily the hero anymore as it was in the days Kingsley Amos referred to it as being such back in the 40s and perhaps the 50s,

26:46.680 --> 26:52.180
but we have real characters now and ideas are handled in a more sophisticated fashion.

26:52.380 --> 26:55.520
The writing has also improved from a stylistic standpoint,

26:55.520 --> 26:58.880
but basically I think if you looked at the area,

26:59.600 --> 27:06.620
well even statistically, there are more examples of straightforward storytelling in science fiction

27:06.620 --> 27:11.140
than you might find in general fiction at large.

27:11.780 --> 27:19.140
So that is another reason I am very fond of science fiction because I am basically a storyteller

27:19.140 --> 27:24.540
no matter what I do with mythology or writing devices.

27:24.540 --> 27:29.500
Does Zelazny think science fiction will ever merge with general literature and gain a wider acceptance?

27:30.700 --> 27:40.180
I don't think it will necessarily be merged with the mainstream and I also do not think that this is necessarily a bad thing at all.

27:41.400 --> 27:46.300
It was Santayana who said that about something else entirely,

27:46.300 --> 27:56.840
but which I think is Aparapro, to attempt to give such things a wide currency is to be willing to denature them in order to boast that they have been propagated.

27:58.240 --> 28:09.040
I think science fiction will always have its devotees and that they will grow in number just as the population itself increases,

28:09.400 --> 28:14.240
but I don't know that the percentage is ever going to increase that greatly.

28:14.240 --> 28:20.900
The chances are pretty good that science fiction has at least a few more readers and fans than it would have had had Zelazny not taking it up.

28:21.540 --> 28:25.400
His works stand as an advertisement for the quality and value of good science fiction.

28:33.020 --> 28:35.440
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:35.760 --> 28:41.600
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.520
Thank you for watching!
