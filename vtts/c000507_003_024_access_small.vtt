00:21.120 --> 00:24.460
Okay, hang on let me get the other guys on the phone.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.520
Okay, Darryl are you on the line?

00:29.360 --> 00:29.780
Excuse me?

00:30.480 --> 00:33.400
I got some other people coming on the line here who are working on the show.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.000
Darryl are you on the line?

00:35.160 --> 00:35.340
Yes.

00:35.840 --> 00:36.340
Hi Darryl.

00:36.560 --> 00:36.800
Howdy.

00:37.860 --> 00:39.320
Okay Dave are you on the line?

00:40.040 --> 00:40.480
At the level.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.260
Okay Dave's getting the level set.

00:44.380 --> 00:44.920
Go ahead.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.420
How's the weather out in Florida?

00:47.320 --> 00:48.880
It's still a little bit of a cold weather today.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.240
I think it's been pretty cloudy and a lot cooler than we've been having.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.600
I think we've been having an easier time.

00:58.220 --> 01:02.080
On a set this morning you were pretty high up but maybe you've messed with most of it.

01:03.060 --> 01:03.960
It's been fairly.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.000
We're in our rainy season.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.460
We've had a lot of rain in my chopper week.

01:07.780 --> 01:11.400
Yeah I was out there in September I managed to hit Hurricane Frederick and Hurricane David.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.140
I was up in Washington DC and I got roasted.

01:14.520 --> 01:18.420
I was in New York City and I got roasted and I came back to Florida and popped them out.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.360
And that's where I went in.

01:22.260 --> 01:22.960
Pretty good.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.420
How are the levels Dave?

01:28.640 --> 01:29.520
Dave are you on the line?

01:29.700 --> 01:30.140
Yes I'm here.

01:30.420 --> 01:31.240
Okay you got the level set?

01:31.540 --> 01:31.720
Yes.

01:32.000 --> 01:32.520
Dave Burling.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.220
Right Dave.

01:33.600 --> 01:33.780
Okay.

01:34.020 --> 01:34.220
Hi.

01:35.140 --> 01:38.400
This is the next voice will be David Cruz.

01:39.060 --> 01:39.440
Hi there.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.160
And the other voice is Darryl Lane.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.540
Glad to meet you Mr. Hogan.

01:44.000 --> 01:44.180
Right.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.160
So there are what?

01:45.440 --> 01:46.660
Three of your amps and one here.

01:47.020 --> 01:47.260
Right.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.120
Right now it's gone.

01:48.400 --> 01:48.660
Bye Dave.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.380
Okay we're the team that puts together the show.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.620
The line is a little bit tight.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.240
Your voice drops here and there and I miss the syllable.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.460
Okay we'll try and be distinct on this end.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.340
You can only mount something else but you can help me.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.240
Okay everybody speak into the mouthpiece real good.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.120
Okay I think Darryl is going to lead off with a question.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.340
We're going to first be talking about your book.

02:18.830 --> 02:19.760
Two Faces Tomorrow.

02:20.900 --> 02:26.840
Yeah Mr. Hogan you have some people in the novel I think Hayes and maybe Frank Westcott

02:26.840 --> 02:31.200
too that mentioned that machines might be the next step in evolution.

02:31.480 --> 02:31.680
Yeah.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.440
That there's a natural movement from organic life to inorganic.

02:35.680 --> 02:35.880
Right.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.800
Do you personally believe this or is that just a notion you play with?

02:39.440 --> 02:40.660
A little bit of both really.

02:41.280 --> 02:46.460
It's one way of interpreting the direction that we seem to be moving in.

02:46.930 --> 02:48.740
I don't set myself up as a prophet.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.600
I like to play with things that might be thrown and get pictures around them.

02:53.320 --> 03:05.180
I apply the word evolution not to the restricted sense to biological species but to the universal

03:05.180 --> 03:12.260
process that characterizes the emergence of more complex and more highly ordered systems

03:12.260 --> 03:14.160
out of simpler systems.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.640
Entriple reversal sleep.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.520
We've got a lot of doing profits these days.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.300
We're worried about energy running out.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.720
The latest word they've matched onto is entropy.

03:24.580 --> 03:29.200
The universe is all going to run down and we'll have to wind down our dewyks in our

03:29.200 --> 03:34.260
oil lamp to ration things out so the universe will run another day.

03:35.580 --> 03:41.000
I think they're listing the word entropy out of its scientific context and applying

03:41.000 --> 03:45.700
it already without a full understanding of its meaning.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.620
Entropy increases naturally in a closed system.

03:50.300 --> 03:55.840
In other words, one that is isolated physically or functionally from its environment, particularly

03:55.840 --> 03:57.060
from an energy source.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.900
It seems to be the universal tendency, I use the term universal and the universal tendency

04:03.900 --> 04:04.960
throughout the universe.

04:05.620 --> 04:14.420
The systems that experience an energy throughput are actually self organized for more complex

04:14.420 --> 04:15.740
structures to emerge.

04:17.300 --> 04:23.580
Going right back to the primordial planar of stellar in series or whatever it became

04:23.580 --> 04:29.380
maybe for that we have raw nuclei and then when the temperatures drop a little electron

04:29.380 --> 04:32.400
will come to a much stably amount of nuclear control.

04:32.960 --> 04:37.980
Then when you get down to the temperature of a planetary surface, molecules begin to form

04:37.980 --> 04:42.740
progressively more complex and more fragile molecules and temperature reduces.

04:43.580 --> 04:44.960
Until eventually you get life.

04:46.460 --> 04:55.080
Eventually intelligence and each step in the process the whole, the trust of the underlying

04:55.080 --> 05:01.880
process needs to be to produce more complex or energy intensive systems that operate

05:01.880 --> 05:04.980
with a higher energy throughput from lower ones.

05:05.840 --> 05:11.760
At the latest stage in the net we we turn right before we start a spectrum of the

05:11.760 --> 05:17.640
starboarders and that and we step along the way to the prerequisite of the next.

05:24.120 --> 05:31.560
And now that the brain has appeared what could that be considerably what was it for?

05:32.040 --> 05:38.020
Well guided intelligence to make the changes and I see no law of nature or no principle

05:38.020 --> 05:39.980
that the human being can become intelligent.

05:40.720 --> 05:46.840
I think that's another step along the way.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.240
I think that's the only way to extrapolate the process.

05:49.520 --> 05:56.140
And in both states opening I see absolutely nothing unnatural about the applied intelligence.

05:57.100 --> 06:01.620
Man harnessing fires and the oil and other nuclear energy.

06:02.440 --> 06:08.760
Simply being an expression of that same process is a perfectly natural, raw fall rate operating

06:08.760 --> 06:11.280
at the level of applied intelligence.

06:18.020 --> 06:19.300
That's a very interesting answer.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.460
David told me to hold it for just a second. He's plugging in another machine to increase

06:24.460 --> 06:25.220
the clarity.

06:33.540 --> 06:34.960
Can you hear us okay?

06:34.960 --> 06:36.180
Yes you're coming through fire.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.020
Okay let me get the machine running again.

06:51.780 --> 06:52.920
Yeah I think we're back now.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.960
Yeah I think we've had some change complete.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.140
Sounded like it's better processing time.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.580
I think it was maybe a computer trying to get on the line.

07:02.820 --> 07:04.260
Maybe they're trying to tell us something.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.400
He's checking out the type machine real quick.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.420
Okay James talk to me for just a second.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.460
Speak to me so I can get a level.

07:18.560 --> 07:19.840
Just say a few words there.

07:22.020 --> 07:23.660
Yeah there we go that's got it just fine.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.040
David you back with us?

07:40.200 --> 07:41.500
Yes go ahead Darrell.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.340
David Cruz why don't you go ahead.

07:44.860 --> 07:45.520
Take your turn.

07:46.580 --> 07:49.280
Mr. Hogan I understand that you work with computers yourself.

07:49.280 --> 07:55.120
Do you know how far that we have come toward having a computer program like Hesper that

07:55.120 --> 07:56.980
makes a common sense type of judgment?

07:58.120 --> 07:59.760
Not very far I suspect.

08:02.640 --> 08:09.580
It's interesting to think we look at the process of evolution of physical forms.

08:11.060 --> 08:17.860
People, it's been well it is pretty amazing the complexity and the kind of impressive

08:17.860 --> 08:19.840
biological structures that become.

08:21.400 --> 08:27.520
And the intelligence in my submission is that it is the parallel evolution of our

08:27.520 --> 08:29.780
behavioral patterns and nervous systems.

08:30.680 --> 08:35.600
Coming on while our physical form has been adapted with this.

08:37.640 --> 08:42.380
If survival is the name of the evolution James then obviously things like big T's

08:42.380 --> 08:44.080
and big scans can come or something.

08:44.080 --> 08:52.320
I would contend that behavior of an organism is the least of it's role in determining

08:52.320 --> 08:54.480
the chart of survival.

08:54.760 --> 09:03.000
It's not more so the way in which an organism responds to its environment and how it interacts with its environment.

09:03.000 --> 09:19.140
And if we trace that process we begin to take out a lot of the basic ingredients that

09:19.140 --> 09:25.680
pretty well everybody would agree are necessary components of what we normally term intelligence.

09:25.680 --> 09:32.940
For example, I am answering you questions that we could have gotten around about time to wait.

09:33.700 --> 09:38.740
The earliest jellyfish can add or the stunts can go back to the stunts.

09:39.180 --> 09:46.340
It involves specialized cells that respond into stimuli tactics after it's arrived in the environment

09:46.340 --> 09:53.080
to produce reflex reactions such as expanding a cell and increasing the probability of it

09:53.080 --> 09:54.440
to go down to the water.

09:55.440 --> 10:00.060
By the time you get the jellyfish it's the cells that are specialized and connected up to

10:00.060 --> 10:04.580
a primitive neural network that is co-ordinating the neural network.

10:06.480 --> 10:11.060
Later on we get concentrations of their own tissues to increase the brain.

10:12.120 --> 10:16.680
And as the brain develops, through successively my husband is on the ground.

10:19.080 --> 10:25.700
The entities that are processed in the brain become progressively further removed from the

10:25.700 --> 10:32.800
raw physical sensory data that comes into the outside world.

10:32.960 --> 10:38.080
They become more abstract, more reduced in reality and more symbolic.

10:39.140 --> 10:44.060
For example, the ultimate expression of both of the human being, the entities that we've

10:44.060 --> 10:47.700
manipulated our minds are well-ventured beings.

10:48.740 --> 10:55.400
The quantities that entend on our senses are pressure waves, electromagnetic waves, physical

10:55.400 --> 11:02.140
contact, but in terms of basic physics, we don't perceive the world around us or ourselves

11:02.140 --> 11:03.040
in the internals.

11:03.100 --> 11:09.240
We manipulate symbolic representations of people, friends, enemies, and places, emotions.

11:09.240 --> 11:14.480
All the complicated things that go together to make up the world model and the complex

11:14.480 --> 11:17.960
organism is connected to the complicated environment at a higher level.

11:19.380 --> 11:27.540
And as it is, along the way the organism would be building up its intellectual aspect,

11:27.840 --> 11:33.200
that is, it would be necessary to develop a world model, an analog of the world around

11:33.200 --> 11:39.100
it, which necessarily makes it a 3-dimensional model and is by object.

11:41.920 --> 11:59.380
Man is, if it's, leading to some kind of, that becomes a primary driving force.

11:59.380 --> 12:05.760
And it's a very necessary function to develop the notion of a self-sufficiency to survive

12:05.760 --> 12:10.840
and to protect the existing, existing, and the other, the re-rater of the environment

12:10.840 --> 12:12.340
which is essentially involved.

12:13.080 --> 12:19.200
So the self-image within that environment becomes pretty hard to escape from.

12:19.400 --> 12:25.220
To put it in evolutionary terms, once the self-image began to emerge, it would be very, very strongly

12:25.220 --> 12:25.860
reinforced.

12:28.980 --> 12:33.140
And, going up to the more complex, I would say, yep, please.

12:37.540 --> 12:38.800
I should know.

12:54.260 --> 12:55.840
Yes, sir.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.820
Yes, sir.

13:25.820 --> 13:43.620

Yes, sir.

26:28.660 --> 26:30.060

Yes, sir.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.320
Yes, sir.

34:18.120 --> 34:22.360
Yes, sir.

34:25.600 --> 34:31.520
Are you conscious of your role as a hard science fiction writer?

35:50.940 --> 35:52.340
I'm not a hard science fiction writer.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.320
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

36:29.800 --> 36:35.960
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

36:37.640 --> 36:38.900
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.880
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

37:19.380 --> 37:38.520
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

37:44.880 --> 37:54.160
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

38:22.740 --> 38:24.140
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.120
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.740
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

39:36.020 --> 39:52.760
I'm a hard science fiction writer.

40:19.580 --> 40:21.620
