00:01.460 --> 00:03.120
We'll roll tape here for a second.

00:03.500 --> 00:07.720
Darrell, I'm gonna be throwing you a signal tape delayed so you can check what it sounds

00:07.720 --> 00:08.460
like on the tape.

00:09.580 --> 00:10.820
Okay, you're now tape delayed.

00:11.080 --> 00:11.780
What's the sound like?

00:14.240 --> 00:14.600
Yeah.

00:15.620 --> 00:17.260
Okay, now you should just be getting one voice.

00:18.620 --> 00:19.720
Okay, hold on.

00:22.460 --> 00:24.160
Okay, now you should be getting one voice.

00:25.060 --> 00:25.940
Still two voices?

00:26.880 --> 00:27.760
Oh, I don't know what it is.

00:27.760 --> 00:28.120
Just hang on.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.640
Okay, now you're getting one voice.

00:30.740 --> 00:31.020
Okay.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.560
Uh, Joe says hello to Darrell.

00:33.920 --> 00:34.620
Hello, Darrell.

00:35.540 --> 00:36.220
Are you in here?

00:36.980 --> 00:37.800
No, I'm in here.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.300
Uh, what's the sound like, Darrell?

00:42.120 --> 00:42.920
Sounds good.

00:43.020 --> 00:43.260
Okay.

00:43.380 --> 00:44.820
Okay, switching back to standard.

00:46.460 --> 00:46.900
Alrighty.

00:49.580 --> 00:51.400
Um, we're ready to go on this, Ann.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.760
Are you set on that end?

00:53.180 --> 00:53.400
Yeah.

00:54.240 --> 00:54.760
Okay.

01:00.500 --> 01:08.500
Um, a lot of, I read The Forward in Study War No More again last night.

01:08.600 --> 01:13.880
So some of this stuff is things you've already talked about and other things.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.380
But some of our, a lot of people listen to the show probably.

01:19.020 --> 01:21.500
If they read books, they all read Forge.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.360
Yeah.

01:23.280 --> 01:23.740
Okay.

01:24.220 --> 01:26.360
Um, this is my first question.

01:27.220 --> 01:27.580
Okay.

01:27.740 --> 01:28.200
Oh, yeah.

01:28.580 --> 01:30.840
Uh, some of the questions will not be exactly a question.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.640
I'll just make a statement and then you can respond to it.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.060
Fine.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.400
Like this first one.

01:36.380 --> 01:42.500
Um, it's, your writing, uh, started out as a hobby, uh, that developed into a profession, didn't it?

01:43.040 --> 01:50.520
Well, yeah, although the development is fairly rampant, uh, I always wrote ever since I was, oh, in second or third grade.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.940
I wrote a lot of poetry.

01:53.800 --> 02:00.760
And, uh, well, when I was, uh, senior in college my last semester, I took a creative writing course.

02:01.240 --> 02:07.140
So I was in physics and astronomy, but I wanted to take something easy to fill out my 18 hours or so.

02:07.940 --> 02:10.120
And I wrote two science fiction stories.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.580
And, uh, eventually I sold both of them.

02:14.540 --> 02:15.220
I was drafted.

02:15.220 --> 02:21.060
And then when I came back from Vietnam, they give you 30 days leave and I just re-typed the stories then and sent them out.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.820
And one of them sold before I was out of the army.

02:25.560 --> 02:32.900
Then I don't know, I just, uh, I never thought you could make very much money at it, but I sort of, sort of, a source of dear money.

02:34.340 --> 02:43.420
And, uh, when I decided to drop out of graduate school and try a semester of writing full time, I sold my first novel about,

02:43.420 --> 02:45.740
a couple of days after I dropped out.

02:46.060 --> 02:47.500
So I never went back.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.980
That would tend to kind of cement things.

02:51.860 --> 02:52.020
Yeah.

02:53.660 --> 02:54.100
Yeah.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.100
So it's a, it's funny, coincidence has a lot to do with it.

02:57.980 --> 03:00.720
There's an awful lot of luck in not getting started writing.

03:01.940 --> 03:02.280
Yeah.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.840
Uh, your first works, uh, had to do with war.

03:06.180 --> 03:09.600
Uh, you were in Vietnam and that must have had a significant impact on you.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.400
Oh yeah, well, it's, uh, of course it's the most true thing.

03:13.400 --> 03:18.260
The dramatic thing has ever happened to me, so it's the most obvious, uh, fuel for my fiction.

03:19.060 --> 03:26.700
Although I don't want to be typed as a writer about war, I have written two novels and edited one at the Alchemy about it.

03:27.780 --> 03:28.300
Yeah.

03:29.120 --> 03:29.380
Yeah.

03:29.660 --> 03:38.420
The old adage to write what you know, and of the things I know that's the one that's most, uh, universally interesting.

03:40.040 --> 03:40.640
Okay.

03:41.040 --> 03:41.340
Yeah.

03:41.460 --> 03:51.200
A couple of the following questions have to do with, with, with, uh, war and some of the themes you have in some of your books and stories.

03:52.100 --> 03:52.700
Okay.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.320
Here they come.

03:54.980 --> 03:55.300
Okay.

03:55.600 --> 04:08.400
Uh, and infinite dreams, which is a collection of stories you published, uh, in various publications since about 1972, um, war and, uh, violence linked with the war.

04:08.400 --> 04:14.120
And with a change in mankind's behavior seem to be recurrent themes in some of these stories.

04:15.160 --> 04:20.920
Um, are you saying that sometimes man has to face violent conflicts in order to change his behavior?

04:22.280 --> 04:26.900
Well, I don't think I'm coming out and saying it that directly.

04:27.720 --> 04:33.480
I think it's obvious that, uh, confronting death on a daily basis changes people.

04:33.480 --> 04:39.740
Sometimes, uh, radically for the worse, and that people are totally dehumanized by war.

04:40.720 --> 04:46.040
Uh, but speaking racially, I don't think you could make such a broad statement.

04:47.020 --> 04:54.880
Uh, what's behind some of the things I'm writing is the hope that human nature eventually may improve to the point where we won't have wars.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.280
Find other ways to settle our differences.

05:01.260 --> 05:01.820
Yeah.

05:01.820 --> 05:01.920
Yeah.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.460
Let me skip up that.

05:10.820 --> 05:13.880
Got another question that has to deal with that. Let me find it here.

05:13.880 --> 05:14.420
Yeah.

05:29.820 --> 05:34.060
Well, while Dave is trying to find his question that he just wrote down about half an hour ago.

05:34.460 --> 05:34.660
Yeah.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.100
Maybe I missed that one when I was transcribing it to typewritten material.

05:47.420 --> 05:59.620
Yeah. Well, actually, uh, being in the army was, uh, had an important effect on my writing, aside from war, because, uh, I met a whole new class of people.

06:00.460 --> 06:09.240
That is all of my friends while I was growing up, and tended to be a white middle class, upper middle class kids.

06:09.240 --> 06:16.180
And there were successors, white middle class, upper class, uh, scientists, so forth.

06:17.040 --> 06:25.920
And it was, uh, just a mundane revelation to find that people who came from different backgrounds still had an awful lot in common with me.

06:27.640 --> 06:34.240
Most of the guys in my combat outfit were urban black high school or junior high school dropouts.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.080
Yeah.

06:36.120 --> 06:36.960
You got along quite well.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.800
Yeah. I found the question.

06:42.820 --> 06:51.660
In both your novels, Mindbridge and Forever War, you have mankind united in the face of a crisis with an alien race.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.960
Do you think that we'll ever be able to progress without this sort of conflict spurring it on?

06:58.140 --> 07:06.340
I wonder whether, well, of course, it's a simplification, uh, and it's an old, uh, theme in science fiction.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.560
That is everybody getting together because the Martians are after us.

07:10.240 --> 07:19.960
Uh, I wish I could say that I thought that we would be able to do this in the face of a less dramatic uniform enemy that is obviously the threats,

07:20.720 --> 07:25.760
combined threats of overpopulation and dwindling resources and industrial pollution.

07:26.700 --> 07:37.240
Are as threatening as either of the enemies in those two novels, but we can't make a coherent face against this enemy and fight it.

07:38.260 --> 07:46.000
Um, it's just a, it's a way of making specific, sort of a real, but diffuse nightmare.

07:48.680 --> 08:04.920
Yeah. And, uh, in some of your stories that do deal with war and conflict, um, on a personal level, uh, where, uh, like in, uh, there's a story where a man is,

08:05.940 --> 08:16.640
um, hit by a laser mine and his, uh, his leg is, is, uh, cut off and he's hurt, uh, he's hurt personally.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.220
Um, does that relate to something in your own experiences?

08:21.020 --> 08:25.720
Well, yeah, I was wounded pretty severely in Vietnam. I was hospitalized for six months.

08:26.740 --> 08:32.060
Uh, and it was a booby trap. I didn't set it off. Somebody else did, but it was a pretty big one.

08:32.800 --> 08:41.700
I had over 200 separate wounds, but managed to come out of it all right after a few months of physical therapy.

08:43.360 --> 08:49.040
So it's, uh, yeah, I draw on that experience. The one, the one you're talking about is the mind of his own.

08:50.040 --> 08:56.640
But I think I've got other, uh, short stories like the private war of private Jacob that draw on that memory.

08:57.180 --> 08:59.160
Yeah. Are you exercising demons?

09:00.040 --> 09:00.260
Pardon?

09:00.260 --> 09:02.080
Are you exercising some demons?

09:03.020 --> 09:08.240
I don't, uh, I don't know whether I am or not. Uh, I think I'm just using available material.

09:09.220 --> 09:14.540
If the, uh, I don't think the demon is too easily exercised by fiction.

09:15.700 --> 09:18.720
That's a, uh, a truism that I don't think is always true.

09:19.280 --> 09:29.540
Yeah. Uh, in your first novel, Forever War, um, it's a, uh, novel that deals with, uh, war on anergalactic or, anergalactic level.

09:30.160 --> 09:39.020
Um, is it, uh, it's similar in some respects to Heinlein's Starship Troopers.

09:39.760 --> 09:47.760
Uh, did you intentionally write it as sort of an answer to that or has it just come about, did the work ended up that way?

09:48.360 --> 09:51.600
Well, there was no rough intention on my part.

09:51.600 --> 10:00.280
Uh, in fact, I didn't realize until I was about 70 or 80 pages into the book that many of the details were similar to Starship Troopers.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.020
Somebody else pointed that out when he read the manuscript.

10:04.100 --> 10:13.460
I wasn't, uh, doing an answer to Heinlein's book. I thought Heinlein's book was admirable in many ways, even though we have, uh, diametrically opposed philosophies.

10:14.940 --> 10:34.640
But the, uh, I know it was, if it, if there's any relation to any book, it is to my own first novel, War Year, because it's, uh, an expansion into a science fiction universe of the notions that I was trying to express in, uh, mainstream novel.

10:53.740 --> 10:54.280
Yeah, that was...

10:54.280 --> 10:56.020
Yeah, I've heard he's a very interesting man.

10:56.340 --> 10:56.540
Yeah.

11:00.360 --> 11:15.200
Um, also, uh, in For Ever War, you deal with, uh, time compression on the Starships. They travel off the battle at speeds near to that of light, and then when they return, hundreds of years have passed on the Earth.

11:15.820 --> 11:16.920
That's hard science.

11:17.700 --> 11:17.720
Yeah.

11:17.720 --> 11:23.420
Uh, many writers are, you know, if they're considered hard science or soft science, and some mix the two styles together.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.400
Um, what part does hard science play in your writing?

11:27.320 --> 11:31.800
Well, I try to use it to make the worlds that are in the event more believable.

11:32.540 --> 11:38.720
Uh, at least to me, since I do have a background in science and engineering, I think, uh...

11:39.300 --> 11:49.260
Well, the writer has to at least suspend his own disbelief while he's making up these stories, and it's easier for me to do it if it's on a fairly solid scientific foundation.

11:50.460 --> 12:02.400
Even though my science is rather old-fashioned and probably rather sloppy by, uh, my real scientist's standards, it's still enough to convince me, so it's fulfilled its function.

12:03.900 --> 12:04.320
Yeah.

12:04.320 --> 12:13.920
The, uh, for instance, the... it goes deeper than just description, the, uh, time dilation in, uh, the forever war.

12:14.260 --> 12:28.500
So it's scientifically accurate. Its main function is metaphorical, and that is to demonstrate how the soldiers who fight a war become isolated from the culture that they're supposed to be protecting.

12:29.720 --> 12:35.760
It's using a science-fictional device to exaggerate something that, uh, happens to every soldier.

12:38.420 --> 12:44.760
Yeah, and then that, when these soldiers leave and come back, uh, the world they left isn't even the same world once they get back to it.

12:45.120 --> 12:45.980
Right. Which is quite true.

12:47.280 --> 12:55.600
I remember when I came back from Vietnam, I was suddenly plunged into what was an alien culture, even though I'd only been a soldier for two years.

12:56.660 --> 13:06.220
A lot of things had changed, and, you know, it's not, uh, not a great thing to come back. There were no victory parades, and that sort of thing.

13:09.980 --> 13:13.460
Yeah. I can empathize with that.

13:13.820 --> 13:13.980
Yeah.

13:13.980 --> 13:27.040
Um, the conflicts aside, um, Forever War and Mind Bridge have optimistic endings, but, uh, in your novel, All My Sins Remembered, was that put together from a series of short stories?

13:27.760 --> 13:31.580
Uh, about half of it appeared as two novelettes, you know.

13:31.940 --> 13:42.160
Yeah. But in the end of it, uh, the protagonist is just literally turned off and, uh, and killed at the end of it. It's a, it's a rather pessimistic ending.

13:42.940 --> 13:55.580
Well, it was, uh, it was planned all along that way. The story is about a bureaucracy that totally takes over a man's identity, and he doesn't really exist except as a tool for that bureaucracy.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.420
When it becomes an efficient tool, he's scrapped.

14:01.360 --> 14:08.300
Yeah. He's, uh, programmed to go out and do certain, I guess what you'd call, covert operations.

14:08.700 --> 14:08.920
Yeah.

14:10.720 --> 14:21.960
And, uh, he goes more or less against his will, that is to say, through very advanced techniques of conditioning, he's turned into a thoroughly different person.

14:22.400 --> 14:32.760
He was a Buddhist, uh, a pacifist when he started out. He did not get the job he signed up for. They twisted him around into a killing machine.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.460
And at the end of it, he, uh, what, rebelled against that?

14:37.460 --> 14:38.360
Yeah, fine.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.840
Man, he was no longer suited their purpose and then they got rid of him.

14:44.180 --> 14:44.340
Right.

14:44.980 --> 14:54.940
Yeah. Um, uh, jumping up to Mindbridge, um, it's dedicated to your teachers at the Iowa Writers Workshop.

14:55.520 --> 14:55.840
Right.

14:55.980 --> 14:59.800
And the, the style of the novel is, is unusual. Is there a connection with that?

15:00.700 --> 15:04.420
Oh, not really. The connection is with John Dos Ponses. Thanks.

15:05.500 --> 15:15.540
Uh, I read the USH reality some years before at Broke Mindbridge and really was impressed by the way it worked and thought it worked really well in science fiction.

15:16.320 --> 15:22.160
So I tried it out in a rather long short story, to Howard Hughes, an Autism Proposal.

15:23.180 --> 15:27.680
And it looked like it would work. So I went ahead and applied it to Mindbridge.

15:27.680 --> 15:34.180
And it's, the, uh, I did do most of that book while I was studying at Iowa and that's why it was a dedication.

15:37.200 --> 15:44.880
Yeah, you also used, used a lot of some humor in, uh, to Howard Hughes and Modest Proposal.

15:45.400 --> 15:49.720
Um, do you find that a, a useful tool to get across your message?

15:50.140 --> 15:53.560
Yeah. I think sarcasm is the operative word.

15:54.320 --> 16:01.160
Yeah, I think even in a deadly serious book there has to be some leavening of humor.

16:01.880 --> 16:06.380
A lot of science fiction is just too, uh, somber and full of message.

16:07.720 --> 16:11.760
I think my primary function is to be an entertainer.

16:14.020 --> 16:15.260
Humor is part of that.

16:20.440 --> 16:25.940
Um, also noticed in the dedication, a lot of the authors at the workshop were mainstream authors.

16:26.400 --> 16:26.540
Yeah.

16:26.780 --> 16:29.880
Uh, did they, uh, what was their reaction to, to science fiction?

16:30.500 --> 16:36.440
Well, they were a little apprehensive about it. See, they didn't know I was a science fiction writer when I joined the workshop.

16:37.300 --> 16:41.580
So I joined on the basis of my first novel, which was not science fiction.

16:42.440 --> 16:48.320
And it was, uh, some of them were outwardly hostile towards science fiction, such as Stanley Elkham.

16:49.220 --> 16:53.660
Others were anywhere between apprehensive and slightly sympathetic.

16:54.540 --> 17:00.140
Stephen Becker, one of them had actually had a few pieces in the magazine Fantasy and Science Fiction.

17:01.240 --> 17:10.840
In general, though, they, uh, thinly disguised attitude that, uh, this stuff was just commercial fiction.

17:11.580 --> 17:12.920
Or beneath contempt.

17:14.360 --> 17:20.800
But, uh, they couldn't ignore the fact that I was making more money than most of them were with my science fiction.

17:21.860 --> 17:24.880
And that, uh, might have been a cause of tension in some cases.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.360
Yeah, that's a point that's kind of hard to argue with.

17:27.560 --> 17:27.740
Yeah.

17:29.360 --> 17:36.500
That attitude is, is one I've never really been able to understand because some of our greatest novels are science fiction novels.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.360
Well, that's true.

17:38.260 --> 17:41.700
But the, uh, the field is judged by its worst, not by its best.

17:42.800 --> 17:49.880
And people like that, uh, think of science fiction, they think in terms of great D movies and, uh, Lazy Television.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.200
They don't, they've never read much of the best of the field.

17:59.280 --> 17:59.760
Pity.

18:01.220 --> 18:02.160
That's true.

18:02.800 --> 18:10.260
Um, uh, back again to Mindbridge, um, uh, a specific question about it.

18:10.600 --> 18:16.280
The alien race that created the Mindbridge, uh, you suggest they commit racial suicide.

18:17.280 --> 18:21.080
Uh, why do you think a supposedly advanced race would do something like that?

18:21.640 --> 18:23.160
I don't know.

18:23.160 --> 18:32.920
So, I was feeling well, they lived for millions or hundreds of millions or even billions of years, thoroughly, individually immortal.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.340
And it just wasn't anything else that they hadn't done, except die.

18:38.780 --> 18:45.140
But I just, uh, that sort of throw away, there's, uh, I didn't put any deep thought into why they should do that.

18:45.140 --> 18:56.640
I just wanted the image of, uh, the, uh, light from their passing, fighting up the nights of Earth's fault. Humans were just behind their fault.

18:57.700 --> 19:00.360
Yeah, they, uh, they supernovaed their star.

19:00.880 --> 19:01.060
Yeah.

19:02.640 --> 19:07.560
The signature stoop, uh, remains of their civilization.

19:09.480 --> 19:15.240
Yeah. Um, I may be wrong here and then this next question, so correct me if I am.

19:16.020 --> 19:22.380
Um, in Tri Centennial, uh, when the starship returns to Earth, all of the humans are gone.

19:23.180 --> 19:24.660
Yeah, it never returns, actually.

19:24.720 --> 19:25.440
It doesn't return.

19:25.660 --> 19:25.860
Okay.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.720
That's a shift in viewpoint.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.660
Oh, okay. Uh, what happened to the humans on the Earth?

19:32.220 --> 19:33.180
Some sort of a war.

19:33.180 --> 19:34.140
I assume.

19:34.760 --> 19:35.120
Okay.

19:35.400 --> 19:44.200
The, uh, it doesn't say anything except that there's no life left on Earth and it looks pretty much like an ecological zero.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.760
It's just, uh, a void.

19:50.500 --> 19:55.220
And my other question about Tri Centennial is who were the beings in the glass and metal tubes?

19:55.820 --> 20:01.900
Well, those are the leftovers, the people who were on the L5 type colony.

20:02.080 --> 20:07.060
They're still there. Their society is a closed cycle, agriculture society.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.560
And there's no reason that they, uh, would have to die when the Earth died.

20:13.000 --> 20:23.220
Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. Um, in various novels and stories that you've written, you've created some excellent aliens.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.260
How do you go about constructing your aliens?

20:26.080 --> 20:30.960
Not very logically. I, uh, I've been asked that before and it's a hard thing to answer.

20:31.420 --> 20:37.520
I know, uh, for instance, the Lebron in, uh, Mindbridge.

20:38.360 --> 20:46.460
I did have this notion of, uh, aliens who were shape-changers who appeared as angelically beautiful creatures,

20:46.700 --> 20:51.020
but were ferocious killers, uh, mindless killers.

20:51.020 --> 20:52.340
I wanted that image.

20:54.040 --> 20:59.460
But normally, I don't know the, uh, the Sik-Kang and, uh, all my sins are remembered.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.440
I just thought I'd make a big bug that had a Jewish sense of humor.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.180
And that's, so that's all. I just, everything else is decoration.

21:09.140 --> 21:14.100
You sort of close your eyes and see this critter and, uh, type it down.

21:14.100 --> 21:31.060
Um, I have on occasion, uh, looked through books of animal anatomy and just clenched through biology and botany types of books to try to be inspired by natural forms.

21:32.200 --> 21:36.440
But I don't have any algorithm that I know works for making monsters.

21:38.120 --> 21:52.400
Ah. Um, in Mindbridge and Forever War, humanity has greatly changed at the end of both of the books, almost an evolutionary difference.

21:53.520 --> 21:59.020
Do you believe that we will radically have, have radically different natures in the future?

21:59.580 --> 22:04.100
I think it's quite possible, even, uh, say within the span of a century.

22:04.540 --> 22:10.740
So many of the things that determine human nature are things that can be mitigated by technology.

22:12.020 --> 22:18.000
Uh, such as, uh, the problem of, uh, dying so soon.

22:19.100 --> 22:27.480
That is, it's possible to develop in a couple of generations, being to live a century, two centuries, maybe a thousand years,

22:27.480 --> 22:29.020
maybe as long as you care to.

22:29.900 --> 22:35.120
That will radically change human nature because it will take the pressure off, of individuals.

22:36.820 --> 22:50.760
Um, the other or other less so sanguine notions, it's possible that, uh, that sciences and communication will, uh, grow into a kind of sophisticated mind control.

22:50.760 --> 22:58.680
It will be difficult for the individual to know exactly what is his idea and what has been induced by his own society.

22:59.920 --> 23:04.860
Uh, sort of a sophisticated life-long brainwashing doesn't seem too unlikely.

23:05.660 --> 23:07.720
If you can argue that it's happening now.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.780
Similar to what, uh, Corn Booth and Poald did in Space Merchants.

23:14.020 --> 23:14.240
Right.

23:16.080 --> 23:20.740
Space Merchants is a chillingly prophetic novel actually.

23:23.460 --> 23:25.560
They do a lot of things with their heads.

23:26.980 --> 23:32.280
Those of us who stay away from the TV screen art is affected by others, but it is there.

23:35.100 --> 23:46.980
Yeah, um, out of the novels and short stories that you've written, which one did you enjoy writing the most?

23:47.780 --> 23:49.220
I don't know, let me see.

23:51.180 --> 24:02.280
Strangely enough, I think I enjoyed most writing a pseudonymous adventure novel called Antards of a Venge.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.820
Because it was so easy.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.200
Most of my writing was very difficult to do.

24:09.260 --> 24:15.520
And it's just, uh, setting a spy up and letting him knock the bad guys down and win in the end.

24:15.780 --> 24:17.200
It's all very pleasant.

24:18.340 --> 24:23.600
In terms of more serious work, I think Mindbridge was the most fun to write.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.260
I had the most latitude there.

24:27.060 --> 24:31.300
I also enjoyed that the most until this latest one.

24:33.500 --> 24:34.060
What?

24:36.760 --> 24:37.320
Um...

24:38.200 --> 24:39.880
Yeah, I read Antard the Merman.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.700
Oh, oh, God, I guess it was a couple of years back.

24:42.920 --> 24:43.920
When did you write that?

24:44.960 --> 24:47.560
Oh, I guess about 1971.

24:48.900 --> 24:49.200
Yeah.

24:51.940 --> 24:53.460
I didn't even know it was you.

24:56.060 --> 24:58.260
That one, I got captured by the cover.

24:58.940 --> 25:00.220
Oh yeah, I'm a dicko.

25:00.580 --> 25:05.100
Yeah, but that appeared to be the beginning of a series.

25:05.960 --> 25:06.940
Yes, that's right.

25:07.440 --> 25:13.880
The, uh, idea was I was going to write a three or four, and then somebody else was going to pick it up.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.140
That's why it's not under my name.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.560
It's what they call a house name.

25:18.980 --> 25:23.440
And, uh, I got tired of the damn thing after two.

25:24.280 --> 25:29.620
And I did write a third one and got paid for it, but it was pretty lousy and they didn't print it.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.840
And then the whole series just fizzled away.

25:34.700 --> 25:40.140
I guess they were working on a contemporary enthusiasm over dolphins.

25:40.900 --> 25:45.460
And when that started evaporating, they put the kibosh on the series.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.000
Or maybe they couldn't find anybody to continue it.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.260
Yeah, I would imagine writing a series book like that would be difficult.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.420
Well, the first one's easy.

25:58.740 --> 26:03.380
And in the case of Hector, the second one was pretty easy too.

26:04.520 --> 26:10.100
But I've also done two Star Trek novels, which are sort of series things.

26:11.340 --> 26:13.080
It gets old real fast.

26:14.260 --> 26:15.900
You can't make up things.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.800
You have to be consistent with the canon that you've already established.

26:21.060 --> 26:23.980
And that can get real boring after about 100,000 orders.

26:25.880 --> 26:26.440
Terrific.

26:26.440 --> 26:31.560
Yeah, and the Star Trek material that you've written, you're already...

26:32.700 --> 26:35.940
The framework is already built and you have to build a story around the framework.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.360
Yeah, it's already established.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.960
That was sort of cute though, writing the first one.

26:41.060 --> 26:46.120
I had fun because I've been in service during most of Star Trek.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.420
And so I had to treat it as a research project.

26:49.620 --> 26:54.220
And I would solve the TV show every afternoon and then I'd read all the books

26:55.140 --> 26:58.700
and make charts and things like that and then sat down and wrote the books.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.160
That was an odd thing.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.680
I had to sign a two-book contract.

27:04.620 --> 27:08.480
And whereas I found the first one very interesting and fun to write,

27:08.620 --> 27:10.700
the second one was quite difficult to write.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.400
And the first one took three months and the second took nine.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.840
How did you get approached to write those?

27:19.820 --> 27:22.320
Well, it was just being in the right place at the right time.

27:22.320 --> 27:26.960
In a way, Jim Bliss was doing the series of these things.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.400
And I knew they were quite financially successful.

27:31.460 --> 27:38.200
And when Jim died, I was in correspondence with Fred Pole, who was his editor there.

27:39.280 --> 27:45.700
And I just apologized for being like a vulture circling over the corpse,

27:45.860 --> 27:48.940
but I asked whether anybody was picking up Jim's work.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.100
And he said, why don't you give it a try?

27:54.400 --> 28:01.000
And actually, Jim was taking the scripts from the TV show and just turning them into short stories.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.680
Whereas they wanted me to do what Jim would have done if he had lived,

28:04.860 --> 28:08.840
which was write original novels around the Star Trek characters.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.420
One of the novels was Planet of Destruction.

28:14.300 --> 28:16.600
Excuse me, Planet of Judgment.

28:20.880 --> 28:25.980
Let's see, I read one of them and that was one I had to do where they discovered,

28:26.200 --> 28:29.400
I guess, what would be sort of considered a Dyson Sphere.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.080
Is that Planet of Judgment or is that the other one?

28:34.200 --> 28:34.860
World Without End.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.240
World Without End. I could not find that book.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.420
I tore my library up trying to find it.

28:40.520 --> 28:43.640
I like doing the technical part of that.

28:43.920 --> 28:48.980
It's not a Dyson Sphere, so well, it is a hollowed out asteroid.

28:49.680 --> 28:55.300
Burnale Sphere is a more proper name for it.

28:56.020 --> 28:59.220
But I tried to work out this alien science.

28:59.640 --> 29:06.120
I've got a notebook full of stuff about how flying aliens would build their cities.

29:06.120 --> 29:10.640
That part was fun enough. I had to amuse myself sometime.

29:15.060 --> 29:16.600
Off the cuff question here.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.720
Anybody ever consider them for possible Star Trek episodes?

29:23.520 --> 29:29.540
Well, unfortunately, I have no say in that they're quite free to take them without asking me or paying me.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.540
It's part of the contract of Paramount.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.740
Oh, how wonderful of Paramount.

29:42.560 --> 29:49.620
As to your writing itself, how do you go about constructing your novels?

29:49.820 --> 29:55.900
Do you come up with an idea for the novel characters and then work them into a particular setting or what?

29:56.560 --> 30:06.680
Well, the most consistent pattern they have is working out the actual structure, the way time is handled in the novel.

30:07.740 --> 30:15.520
It sounds rather dry, but I don't like to outline the story in any detail, because then there are no surprises.

30:16.460 --> 30:20.560
So I start out with the structure, how the viewpoint is handled and so forth.

30:20.560 --> 30:24.480
I start working and modify the structure as the story builds.

30:24.860 --> 30:32.380
Usually I have some vague idea of how it's going to end that becomes less vague as the novel progresses.

30:34.440 --> 30:39.700
Short stories I normally start with the characters who seem interesting and make them do something.

30:42.340 --> 30:48.240
In other words, you set up sort of a lettuce work and then you let the story build itself on that.

30:48.240 --> 30:51.700
That seems to work better for me.

30:53.800 --> 31:02.140
Although often the structure does have to be modified halfway through, I don't want to be hit into a procrastin bed by it.

31:06.540 --> 31:11.460
I want to ask some questions about worlds, but this is going to be a neat trick because I haven't read it yet.

31:13.860 --> 31:17.800
Let me get back to the material. It's coming out in March.

31:18.300 --> 31:24.680
From Viking and Hardcover. Do you have a paper contract out on it yet?

31:24.960 --> 31:27.620
No, it's going to auction in December.

31:30.200 --> 31:34.120
You've had pretty good luck with going from Hardcover to Paper, haven't you?

31:34.120 --> 31:43.540
Yeah, so far I have. The reason for doing it is to maintain a high level of critical attention for the books.

31:44.060 --> 31:48.800
These books that are sold as paperback originals don't get reviewed in the right places.

31:49.460 --> 31:53.900
Because you do get more money up front of course doing a paperback deal.

31:55.500 --> 32:00.260
But it seems to have worked in my case to go with the traditional route.

32:08.040 --> 32:10.040
Let's go ahead and keep tape rolling.

32:11.260 --> 32:20.360
What is worlds about? It's a first part of a trilogy.

32:25.680 --> 32:29.400
What's happening in Joe Haldeman's world in worlds?

32:30.380 --> 32:33.000
It starts out about a century from now.

32:34.740 --> 32:40.500
It's essentially the story of a woman who was born and grew up on a space colony.

32:41.260 --> 32:47.060
A space settlement. It is sent to Earth for a year of postgraduate work.

32:47.280 --> 32:48.880
Finishing, if you want to call it that.

32:49.520 --> 32:54.540
Being set up for a political position as it is on between this world and Earth.

32:55.360 --> 32:59.140
And various strange things happened to her in the year that she's here.

32:59.860 --> 33:03.960
It's sort of a old, deltonable novel.

33:05.740 --> 33:10.380
She grows by being sort of bounced around by Earth.

33:12.420 --> 33:20.760
And the second novel, Stars, takes over for the first one in and takes her into old age.

33:23.540 --> 33:26.280
Will all three novels be following this one character?

33:26.960 --> 33:31.940
No, she dies in the second one. I think. I haven't finished the second one yet.

33:33.660 --> 33:37.560
That's an interesting way of writing. You discover it as you write it.

33:37.800 --> 33:44.000
Yeah, that's for me. Some people have to outline very meticulously.

33:44.940 --> 33:48.120
But when I do that, I lose interest in it.

33:48.780 --> 33:50.740
Yeah, you already know what's going to happen.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.960
Yeah, it's just tight.

33:53.600 --> 33:53.980
Right.

34:00.780 --> 34:01.980
What did...

34:01.980 --> 34:04.940
Come on, Dave, phrase the question.

34:08.160 --> 34:13.820
What made you decide to put together a trilogy rather than just like one novel?

34:15.700 --> 34:20.560
Well, it seems like an awfully big thing to put into one book.

34:22.120 --> 34:26.300
And it looks as if each one of the trilogy, each volume of the trilogy,

34:26.400 --> 34:31.480
will be longer than any other book that ever written by us, at least a third.

34:32.200 --> 34:37.760
Each one, so indeed, would have done, well, nearly a half million words long.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.900
So, I had to get the code to sell.

34:41.900 --> 34:46.800
And I just, you know, everybody's doing trilogy, so I can't do a trilogy too.

34:46.940 --> 34:54.820
It's part of it. They're a very successful second and third books have built in audience.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.700
Also, I wanted to try something big.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.860
Half a million words is pretty big.

35:05.080 --> 35:05.280
Yeah.

35:08.200 --> 35:14.740
I was stifling laughs there when you were talking about everybody's written trilogies.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.140
Lots of science fiction trilogies too.

35:19.780 --> 35:24.100
Yeah, so it's almost a sub-genre actually.

35:25.860 --> 35:29.040
And now there are four and five books actually.

35:29.640 --> 35:34.200
Gene Wolf's Torture series, at least under five audience.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.020
But there's no end to it.

35:38.020 --> 35:41.600
Of course, there's a Farm Reserve or Boat series. It just goes on and on and on.

35:44.460 --> 35:44.900
Yeah.

35:46.400 --> 35:51.900
Do you imagine in this trilogy you will have constructed sort of a future history?

35:52.520 --> 35:53.920
Yeah, it turns out that way.

35:54.380 --> 35:59.500
Yeah. Do you think you might follow it up with later novels or that just further on down the line?

35:59.500 --> 36:05.120
No, the third one in the third volume, God's, covers about a million years I think.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.120
So there's not much point in thinking about a fourth one.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.200
In other words, you take it far into the future.

36:12.560 --> 36:12.700
Yeah.

36:12.980 --> 36:17.320
I wanted to try a staple Donnie and kind of novel.

36:19.820 --> 36:22.000
It'll be the most difficult one, I think.

36:22.900 --> 36:26.920
Taking it that far into the future, the possibilities are just about limitless.

36:27.200 --> 36:27.420
Yeah.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.560
And it will probably be optimistic.

36:33.060 --> 36:36.440
The first book is not too optimistic because it's dystopian, I think.

36:37.460 --> 36:47.960
Yeah, Jack Williamson says that most science fiction works, in fact, a lot of mainstream things,

36:48.300 --> 36:51.520
are divided between either utopian or dystopian viewpoints.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.840
Well, the point is neither one is mutually exclusive.

36:58.280 --> 37:07.280
It's possible they have a complex enough vision of the future that we can see alternation, utopia and dystopia.

37:07.780 --> 37:11.760
That's another good thing about having a scoped canvas of a trilogy.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.460
Yeah, it would allow you to cover a lot of areas.

37:16.860 --> 37:17.040
Yeah.

37:18.680 --> 37:29.360
And I can run what I'm doing in both the first and the second is describing two cultures being able to switch from chapter to chapter

37:29.360 --> 37:32.300
and use one to illuminate the other.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.940
And in fact, one is a utopia and one is dystopia.

37:38.440 --> 37:43.820
Okay, I've covered all my questions that I have down here, plus a couple I made up as I went along.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.060
Darrell, is there anything that you would like?

37:46.880 --> 37:47.520
Oh, yeah, okay.

37:50.100 --> 37:56.220
Do you have any authors that you really enjoy reading, science fiction in particular?

37:57.400 --> 37:58.800
Well, it varies a lot.

37:59.060 --> 38:03.500
I guess Gene Mulf is my favorite writer right now.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.940
I like Roger Sophanesney very much.

38:08.740 --> 38:11.980
Actually, I'm reading the number of the beast right now.

38:11.980 --> 38:17.960
The timeline is an old favorite, but I've not been too happy about it lately, folks.

38:19.360 --> 38:23.200
The number of the beast is turning out to be rather more entertaining than I thought it would be.

38:26.020 --> 38:26.900
Let me see.

38:28.700 --> 38:32.140
I like Silverberg and Le Guin.

38:33.760 --> 38:37.160
It's quite a bit of chip delaney, similar to Laney.

38:38.860 --> 38:43.520
Oh, Fred Paul is doing marvelous work now.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.360
The problem is I don't read too much science fiction.

38:48.540 --> 38:53.980
I read something after 16 people have read about it, and I finally go pick it up.

38:55.300 --> 38:58.000
Or 16 people hated it, and I want to find out why.

38:59.980 --> 39:01.380
Good reasons for both.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.140
Oh, yeah, that covers about what we wanted to do.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.280
Any loose ends on your end?

39:11.920 --> 39:12.220
No.

39:12.760 --> 39:15.300
Okay, we're shutting down the tape.
