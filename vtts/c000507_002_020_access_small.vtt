00:11.500 --> 00:18.640
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.640 --> 00:20.860
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.360
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:32.180 --> 00:38.820
The subject of this show is humor and science fiction. Humor is a fairly broad term. It can

00:38.820 --> 00:44.880
include bitter satire, it can be gentle poking fun at human nature, it might be slapstick

00:44.880 --> 00:48.920
fars or burlesque or perhaps just the witty use of the language with punts.

00:50.420 --> 00:55.720
Many seem to think that humor and science fiction don't necessarily mix, that perhaps

00:55.720 --> 00:57.640
good humorist science fiction is a rarity.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.980
But it isn't really. H. D. Wells used a lot of humor and satire in his work as in his short

01:05.980 --> 01:11.680
story, the new accelerator where he has this potion that people take and it speeds up the

01:11.680 --> 01:18.180
reactions tremendously. And then the escapades of these two adventurers when they get out

01:18.180 --> 01:23.500
in the courtyard are the common next to this man's laboratory. Some of the things they

01:23.500 --> 01:24.260
do are hilarious.

01:25.060 --> 01:29.360
And then all through the history of science fiction, of course, if you want to call it

01:29.360 --> 01:33.420
the mainstream of science fiction, it's very action oriented. You know, spaceships, ray

01:33.420 --> 01:39.340
guns, aliens, robots, they're usually didn't seem to be a lot of room for humor. It was

01:39.340 --> 01:44.380
there, but it didn't surface, I think, in the classic works, the things that mostly

01:44.380 --> 01:45.540
made the movies and the novels.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.940
But there are a number of authors who, when their larger body of work have written first

01:51.940 --> 01:58.300
class science fiction, that is humorous. And the first book, which was devoted entirely

01:58.980 --> 02:04.180
to humor and science fiction, was edited by Frederick Brown and Mac Reynolds in 1953.

02:04.180 --> 02:09.260
It was called the science fiction carnival. And in their introduction to that work, Brown

02:09.260 --> 02:15.560
and Reynolds brought out the fact that there's a necessity for laughter. You know, if we

02:15.560 --> 02:19.140
can't laugh at ourselves, we're in pretty bad shape. And that science fiction has unique

02:19.140 --> 02:23.360
qualifications to provide that laughter. And the stories in that volume, I think, were,

02:24.060 --> 02:27.940
you know, illustrated the particular qualifications in science fiction in that area.

02:29.820 --> 02:34.820
Even an author like Arthur C. Clarke, who one usually considers is writing about very

02:34.820 --> 02:40.200
serious themes, such as the destiny of man, or as in 2001, for instance, and very deep

02:40.200 --> 02:45.380
works like that, he has written some very fine humor in science fiction. He said he'd

02:45.380 --> 02:49.320
always wanted to write a tall tale in the science fiction genre that very few people

02:49.320 --> 02:54.220
had done it. And he wrote a volume of them, published in 1957, called Tales from the White

02:54.220 --> 02:54.520
Heart.

02:55.760 --> 03:00.940
One of my favorites from that collection is a story about a movie studio and their special

03:00.940 --> 03:05.520
effects department, and they put together a ray gun for the good guys. And then the

03:05.520 --> 03:08.640
bad guys want a better looking ray gun, so they develop a better looking ray gun for

03:08.640 --> 03:12.540
them. And this goes back and forth and on and on until finally at the end of the story,

03:12.840 --> 03:24.500
they develop such a fantastic special effects style weapon that it actually works. And that,

03:24.500 --> 03:28.260
and developing it, are just wildly witty and very funny.

03:28.880 --> 03:34.040
In exaggerated, Clarke said in his introduction that all the tales in that volume were meant

03:34.040 --> 03:40.880
to be tall tales, deliberately impossible. But there is one branch of humor, a particular

03:40.880 --> 03:46.380
subgenre of humor called satire, which has more of a message or more of a purpose to

03:46.380 --> 03:50.880
it than simply entertainment. And probably this type is found more often than other

03:50.880 --> 03:55.720
types of humor in science fiction, the satiric type. And probably one of the great classics

03:55.720 --> 04:00.300
of all satirical science fiction novels is The Space Merchants by Frederick Pol and Cyril

04:00.300 --> 04:02.080
Cornbluth, published in 1952.

04:03.240 --> 04:09.960
This is a story about a society that's gone mad over advertising and big business. And

04:10.580 --> 04:16.020
Pol and Cornbluth show this through extrapolating, or pushing forward into the future. What

04:16.020 --> 04:22.020
we know now is advertising and showing a world where advertising is totally predominant in

04:22.020 --> 04:28.840
the culture. Big business persuades people to buy things they don't need. And it just

04:28.840 --> 04:35.960
pushes all the concepts behind advertising to their utmost limits of Cornbluth and Pol's

04:35.960 --> 04:36.580
imaginations.

04:37.340 --> 04:41.360
All of these writers have shown that humor in science fiction is not such a rarity after

04:41.360 --> 04:45.640
all. Their work demonstrates that. But the acknowledged master of humor in the field

04:45.640 --> 04:47.060
of science fiction is Elsprague De Camp.

04:48.220 --> 04:53.240
De Camp has been writing first class science fiction for a long time, since 1937. If you

04:53.240 --> 04:56.880
think about it, that puts them a couple years ahead of writers like Isaac Asimov, Robert

04:56.880 --> 05:02.140
Heinlein, A. E. Van Voet and Theodore Sturgeon. In fact, along with these writers, De Camp

05:02.140 --> 05:06.880
helped to form what is nostalgically called the golden age of science fiction.

05:08.300 --> 05:12.200
Much of De Camp's early work, too, I think, was written for the influential editor John

05:12.200 --> 05:19.600
W. Campbell. It's kind of amazing to realize, too, that De Camp is still going strong today

05:19.600 --> 05:25.120
with over 80 books to his credit, both fiction and non-fiction. A good deal of his writing

05:25.120 --> 05:30.300
is in the category of science fiction, although he does tend many times to get into the field

05:30.300 --> 05:36.140
of pure fantasy. But whatever kind of work he's writing, it's notable for its humor.

05:37.060 --> 05:42.660
And overall, I think his humor is a clever, gentle kind that pokes fun at mankind, with

05:42.660 --> 05:44.660
sort of an affectionate tolerance behind it.

05:45.860 --> 05:48.980
The science fiction radio show talked with Sprague De Camp about his work.

06:10.420 --> 06:15.720
First of all, Mr. De Camp, we wonder just a little bit about your origins as a writer

06:15.720 --> 06:21.200
back in the late 1930s. Such things as, well, the circumstances that cause you to start

06:21.200 --> 06:21.520
writing.

06:23.560 --> 06:30.280
Well, in 1937 and eight, I was working in the field of science fiction. I was working

06:30.300 --> 06:36.080
in Scranton, Pennsylvania as principal of the School of Inventing and Patenting of the

06:36.080 --> 06:41.940
International Correspondent Schools. And I had a friend in New York, an old college

06:41.940 --> 06:49.600
roommate of mine, named John Clark, who was out of a job and looking for one. And in order

06:49.600 --> 06:55.280
to continue to eat, he, who was a more faithful reader of the science fiction magazine than

06:55.280 --> 07:04.760
I was at that time, wrote a couple of stories. And I used to come in, oh, once twice a month

07:05.180 --> 07:11.760
to New York, and I'd stay at his apartment and we'd sit up late and plot a couple of

07:11.760 --> 07:17.760
these stories. So I gave him some help with them. He sent them to F. Orlin Cremain, then

07:17.760 --> 07:24.080
the editor of Astounding, and to everybody's surprise, he sold them. So I thought, well,

07:24.080 --> 07:30.260
if he can do that, why can't I? So having plenty of spare time in Scranton, I wrote a

07:30.260 --> 07:36.840
couple and sent them in. And to my surprise, they were bought. Well, at that point I said,

07:36.880 --> 07:43.340
if we, why hasn't somebody told me about this before? It sure beats working. So I wrote

07:43.340 --> 07:52.500
a few more stories and articles, sold some, didn't sell others. And then at the end of

07:52.500 --> 07:59.360
19, let me see, at the beginning of 1939, I was working at another job as one of the

07:59.360 --> 08:06.400
editors on a trade journal in New York, and I got fired in an economy purge. So I thought

08:06.400 --> 08:12.480
instead of fooling around with these piddling editorial jobs, why don't I try freelancing?

08:12.800 --> 08:19.360
You see, I figured that if I spent five hours a week on my own time writing and made a certain

08:19.360 --> 08:24.580
amount of money, if I could spend 50 hours a week at it, I'd make 10 times that much.

08:25.500 --> 08:29.900
Well, of course, there's a fallacy there because you soon run into a law of diminishing returns.

08:30.700 --> 08:38.680
But nevertheless, I took the plunge and found that in freelancing, I earned about as much

08:38.680 --> 08:44.480
as I had been doing, and I could be my own boss, work at my own pace, work sitting down,

08:44.480 --> 08:51.840
and wear out all my old clothes. So except for a couple of temporary jobs and the Second

08:51.840 --> 08:56.420
World War, in which I was in the Naval Reserve, I've been at it ever since.

08:57.860 --> 09:03.040
Excellent. Okay. Those first couple of stories you mentioned that were published to your surprise,

09:03.320 --> 09:04.840
was one of those hyper-polosity?

09:05.280 --> 09:08.480
Yes, hyper-polosity and the isolinguals.

09:09.420 --> 09:12.660
What kind of money did you get when you published those?

09:12.660 --> 09:18.340
Well, let me see. I think it was a set of words, which means I got something like 30 or $40,

09:19.620 --> 09:29.360
I suppose. Actually, if you ask me what was my first published story, that is a question

09:29.360 --> 09:34.220
that can have any one of three answers. If you mean the first one I started writing,

09:35.340 --> 09:42.220
it was the novel, Genus Homo, in collaboration with the late Schuyler Miller. But that, although

09:42.220 --> 09:47.820
we started that back around 1936, it took us over two years to finish it, and it wasn't

09:47.820 --> 09:58.520
published on 1941. If you mean what was the first story I completed? It was a rather amateurish

09:58.520 --> 10:06.020
little caveman story called The Hairless Ones Come, the usual story about the conflict

10:06.020 --> 10:12.900
between the Neanderthal men and the Cro-Man Yards, who overran Europe at the end of the

10:12.900 --> 10:23.000
Fourth Glaciation. And that was published in 1939, I believe it was, in a short live magazine

10:23.000 --> 10:29.700
of historical adventure called Golden Fleece. So that was the first one finished. Then the

10:29.700 --> 10:33.120
first one published was, I believe, the Isolingales.

10:38.020 --> 10:43.120
You obviously have a widespread reputation as a writer of humor, probably the foremost

10:43.120 --> 10:50.060
in the field of science fiction. Do you think of yourself as a humorist? Is that a label

10:50.060 --> 10:53.540
that you want or that you agree with?

10:54.860 --> 11:05.340
Let's say that I'm not an exclusive professional humorist of the type of old, the late P. G.

11:05.580 --> 11:14.300
Woodhouse, for example. But on the other hand, I do try to liven up most of my fiction with

11:14.700 --> 11:21.960
a generous sprinkling of humor. Of course, remember that although people generally refer

11:21.960 --> 11:28.720
to me as the science fiction writer, the reason is mainly that I made my early reputation

11:28.720 --> 11:37.800
in that field. Actually, fiction is only about half of my output, the rest being science,

11:38.000 --> 11:51.940
history, biography, literary criticism, and so on. And of the fictional half, aside from

11:51.940 --> 11:58.240
the strict sense, and half is fantasy. So only about a quarter of my output is really

11:58.240 --> 11:59.880
science fiction in a strict sense.

12:00.980 --> 12:09.100
Yeah, no, I understand that. Back to humor for just a moment. Many critics and readers

12:09.100 --> 12:13.900
and commentators, whatever, have said that science fiction and humor don't mix well.

12:14.040 --> 12:18.900
A good science fiction humor, a story or novel, is sort of a rarity. What would be your comment

12:18.900 --> 12:19.460
about that?

12:21.800 --> 12:28.340
Well, all I can say is that it is true that there aren't a great many humorous stories

12:28.340 --> 12:33.900
in that field. But then of course, there aren't a great many humorous stories in any genre

12:33.900 --> 12:43.500
of fiction. Some people do it and some people don't. Now, back before the Second World War,

12:43.500 --> 12:52.520
sorry, I'm not that old quite yet, but before the Second World War, of the active science

12:52.520 --> 12:59.260
fiction writers in the country, there were only two who were considered humorous science

12:59.260 --> 13:07.940
fiction writers. And I was one and Henry Kutner was the other. Curiously enough, both Henry

13:07.940 --> 13:13.600
and I, in our private lives, were rather serious solemn fellows.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.740
Okay. For a number of years, I've been a fan of your Harold Shea stories, the ones you

13:24.740 --> 13:29.280
collaborated with Fletcher Pratt on. If I understand right now, the first one of those

13:29.280 --> 13:35.520
was the roaring trumpet published around 1940 or so. Okay, how did that collaboration with

13:35.520 --> 13:36.480
Fletcher Pratt start?

13:39.240 --> 13:47.500
Fletcher Pratt was a military-enabled historian, among other things, and he ran a naval war

13:47.500 --> 13:53.740
game in his apartment in New York City. Later they moved to a hired hall when the game got

13:53.740 --> 14:00.980
too large in which people crawled around on the floor, pushing little model boats, ship

14:00.980 --> 14:06.240
warships, models of real ships, which Fletcher whittled out at his desk while he was waiting

14:06.240 --> 14:10.960
for the next sentence to come. They were made out of balsa wood and wires and pins and things.

14:14.400 --> 14:20.640
And I was also an able buff, a regular reader of James fighting ships and so forth, and

14:20.640 --> 14:28.080
I could tell you what was the armament of the French Terribler class, 5.5-inch guns,

14:28.080 --> 14:37.400
and so on. And so was John Clark, and he got in touch with Fletcher, being more aggressive,

14:37.520 --> 14:42.560
let us say, and less shy than I in such matters. He went around and called on him and presently

14:42.560 --> 14:46.880
was enrolled in the naval war game, and then he brought me around to meet Fletcher, and

14:46.880 --> 14:53.640
I was enrolled and was a regular war game player. Well, Fletcher was at that time an

14:53.640 --> 15:00.900
established and active writer, and I was a struggling young pro, you might say. So John

15:00.900 --> 15:05.440
said to me, hey, Fletcher says he would like to see you. He has an idea for some stories.

15:06.320 --> 15:12.580
So I went around to Fletcher, and he proposed that he and I collaborate on a series of stories

15:12.580 --> 15:21.240
based upon this far out theory that you can slip into any universe you want to by manipulating

15:21.240 --> 15:25.980
the symbols of symbolic logic. I had been studying symbolic logic a little with all

15:25.980 --> 15:35.440
its cuter symbols and things, so okay, we went to it. And that is how the 5 Harold Shea

15:35.440 --> 15:39.460
stories originated, as well as the other practicap collaborations.

15:41.020 --> 15:46.200
One thing that sort of interested me about that particular collaboration, it seems to

15:46.200 --> 15:50.600
me that humor is a very, I guess, a personal thing. I've always wondered how that kind

15:50.600 --> 15:55.420
of a writing process worked. For instance, did you write a story and he go over it? Did

15:55.420 --> 16:00.800
you do alternate stories? How was the actual mechanics of that?

16:01.120 --> 16:05.620
Our method of collaboration, that is to say, the one that we found that worked the best

16:05.620 --> 16:12.740
for us was that he and I would get together on an afternoon, usually in his apartment,

16:13.260 --> 16:20.900
and fresh out story ideas. And he would come up with one and I'd say, no, no, that's not

16:20.900 --> 16:28.600
logical for this or that reason. Or I'd say, well, it seems to me that that's the same

16:28.600 --> 16:35.340
storyline that Cutner had just last year, such and such a magazine, and so forth and

16:35.340 --> 16:38.780
so on. And finally we get a story more or less beaten into shape, and I'd make notes

16:38.780 --> 16:45.860
in shorthand, which I had taught myself, and I'd take them home and I'd write out a

16:47.260 --> 16:54.140
synopsis of the story and submit that to Fletcher and he would make any additions or changes

16:54.140 --> 16:59.260
that he thought desirable. And I'd type the rough draft and give it to him and he would

16:59.260 --> 17:07.340
type the final draft. I have found in collaborations in general that it's usually better for the

17:07.340 --> 17:16.660
younger writer of the pair to do the rough and the older one the final. The reason being

17:16.660 --> 17:21.660
that the younger writer is up to have more energy and more facility, but the older one,

17:21.680 --> 17:29.920
having been around longer, has a sharper critical sense at spotting illogicalities, infelicities

17:29.920 --> 17:33.480
of expression and things of that sort, and weeding them out.

17:37.040 --> 17:42.600
None of those stories had anything to do with Campbell, did it? John W. Campbell is an editor.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.600
Those were entirely separate from him, weren't they?

17:46.040 --> 17:51.920
Well, John Campbell published the first three of the Harold Shea novels.

17:53.400 --> 18:00.900
Okay, yeah, what I was getting at was this. Say for instance the world of Norse mythology

18:00.900 --> 18:07.240
or any of those that you construct, the consistency of it. You know, Harold Shea, none of his modern

18:07.240 --> 18:11.780
things work, you know, the matches, the guns. In other words, there's an internal consistency

18:11.780 --> 18:16.840
in the world even though magic works. Was that your own idea or, you know, I was thinking

18:16.840 --> 18:17.100
of speaking...

18:17.100 --> 18:21.640
Well, that was a common idea. I mean, both Fletcher and I had long since agreed that,

18:22.580 --> 18:28.240
right from the start, that the most effective, that in writing fantasy, you have to be even

18:28.240 --> 18:34.400
more careful about internal consistency than you do in writing a realistic story because

18:34.400 --> 18:38.720
the reader's credulity is already stretched like a rubber band, you see, and if you put

18:39.260 --> 18:45.120
extra strain on it by having some obvious contradiction, it's going to snap. At that

18:45.120 --> 18:46.420
point, you'll probably stop reading.

18:48.140 --> 18:53.560
Okay, good, right. Just my observation that a lot of the science fantasy that was being

18:53.560 --> 18:56.320
written back then especially did not have that kind of consistency.

18:56.320 --> 19:05.460
That is quite right. And I consider myself fairly good at following a train of logic

19:05.460 --> 19:16.220
and spotting cases where people commit inconsistencies of that sort. As for example, one colleague

19:16.220 --> 19:22.340
of mine who's with whom I have collaborated, on one night he will have a full moon and

19:22.340 --> 19:28.380
on the next night he will have the new moon. Well, you can't do that, you know, because

19:28.380 --> 19:31.200
it takes two weeks to get from one state to the other.

19:32.580 --> 19:40.160
Right, yes, I agree entirely. In the Harold Shea stories, as in most or many of the other

19:40.160 --> 19:44.480
novels you've written, at least in the science fantasy area, my observation is that your

19:44.480 --> 19:50.100
humor comes from the unexpected things that happen when you put, say, a modern man back

19:50.100 --> 19:52.080
into a world of legend or myth.

19:52.280 --> 20:02.220
One of the basic elements of humor in my estimation is the element of surprise or incongruity.

20:02.920 --> 20:13.580
In other words, a derby hat on a London businessman is not funny because they all wear them. But

20:13.580 --> 20:19.840
a derby hat on Trudy a Caesar is, you see, because it's incongruous. And that is a very

20:19.840 --> 20:22.620
considerable factor in humor.

20:24.220 --> 20:29.720
Right, and to make that incongruity, I guess, obvious or effective, you had to construct,

20:29.780 --> 20:34.980
I guess, very realistic or very accurate kinds of backgrounds. Say, if it happened in the

20:34.980 --> 20:41.020
ancient world or a mythological world, you had to develop a highly realistic context

20:41.020 --> 20:41.580
for it.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.320
That's right.

20:42.740 --> 20:48.680
Where did your knowledge, your background in ancient history and mythology and so forth

20:48.680 --> 20:50.980
come from? Did you have to research those things heavily or?

20:51.620 --> 20:57.500
Actually, I've always been a very heavy reader. I was reading Darwin's origin of species

20:57.500 --> 21:02.720
through at the age of seven, you know, and things like that. And I had a pretty good

21:03.280 --> 21:08.580
historical and mythological knowledge. But actually, for the roaring trumpet fletcher,

21:08.600 --> 21:14.080
knew a good deal more about that than I, because he was an enthusiast for the Northern thing,

21:14.080 --> 21:20.080
as William Morris called it, and it belonged to a group that got together in Boston and

21:20.080 --> 21:23.200
read Icelandic sagas to each other in the original.

21:24.400 --> 21:31.400
Well, therefore, he was way ahead of me in the matter of Norse mythology. Then, for the

21:31.400 --> 21:37.540
second story, was laid in the world of Spencer's fairy queen. And I had never read the fairy

21:37.540 --> 21:42.880
queen, so I sat down and euthyphally plowed right through it. I never did have quite the

21:42.880 --> 21:47.760
enthusiasm for it. That fletcher did. I found it pretty tedious for long stretches, but

21:47.760 --> 21:53.040
nevertheless, he thought highly of it, and he went through it. And then for the third

21:53.040 --> 22:03.060
one, why we, I knew something about Ariostos Orlando Furioso, although I'd never read it

22:03.060 --> 22:08.660
through, but it wasn't very difficult to get hold of a set and read them. And that furnished

22:08.660 --> 22:17.580
the material there. Well, then we, after the Second World War, we sent Harold to the world

22:17.580 --> 22:23.940
of the Finnish Kalevala, and that was simply a matter of getting the Everyman's Library

22:23.940 --> 22:29.900
edition and reading through that and taking notes. And we finally had him end up where

22:29.900 --> 22:34.980
he'd wanted to go all along, which is in the mythological Ireland of Cufolan and Queen

22:34.980 --> 22:42.260
Maeve. And I already knew a fair amount about that, but I read up some more. So we got the

22:42.260 --> 22:42.660
stories.

22:44.960 --> 22:49.260
I have another question on that book. Some people have said, I've read this, that you

22:49.260 --> 22:54.800
had a serious theme to that work that one, you know, one, can one man change the past

22:54.800 --> 23:00.300
for the better? And I'm not sure if that was intended or if that's even a fair question,

23:00.400 --> 23:02.620
but did you have that kind of a theme behind it?

23:02.620 --> 23:08.160
I mean, I took that as my assumption as to whether it's so or not. I don't know. I don't

23:08.160 --> 23:15.720
think anyone else knows either, because there's such a large factor of luck in all these historical

23:15.720 --> 23:19.980
developments, you know, as the poet had fallen off his horse and broken his neck early in

23:19.980 --> 23:27.040
his career. Why? What would have happened? And history is full of things like that, where

23:27.780 --> 23:34.740
what looks like is going to be an amazing career is cut short by some adventitious circumstance.

23:35.500 --> 23:43.760
However, my primary purpose in writing fiction has always been to entertain. And everything

23:43.760 --> 23:50.520
else takes a secondary place. Now, I don't say that a little preaching propaganda for

23:50.520 --> 23:58.820
causes that I personally admire like wildlife conservation, let's say, or my personal opinions

23:58.820 --> 24:06.660
and prejudices don't sneak in now and then. But nevertheless, the main purpose is entertainment.

24:07.460 --> 24:14.680
Some people say have said that, oh, well, such and such a story by DeCamp is a satire,

24:14.680 --> 24:21.680
well, I don't consider myself a satirist. In other words, I don't write for the intention

24:21.680 --> 24:32.820
or with the intention of holding up some human institution or form of action to ridicule

24:32.820 --> 24:40.440
in the serious hope of getting people to change it. But on the other hand, the human scene

24:40.440 --> 24:50.280
around me is so full of dramatic and absurd and comical features that it's only natural

24:50.280 --> 24:57.520
to use them and put them in my stories. You have beautifully anticipated my next question

24:57.520 --> 25:10.420
which was going to be that I did see a strain of gentle satire in your work and I was going

25:10.420 --> 25:15.460
to say that if you really look around you over a good many years, you see so many funny

25:15.460 --> 25:21.960
things that you don't have to exercise great ingenuity or imagination in order to get an

25:22.560 --> 25:27.060
entertaining story out of it. I'm not sure I'm going to pronounce this right, but the

25:28.200 --> 25:32.500
Gavagan's Bar is that how it's... Correct. Okay, of course, that was another collaboration

25:32.500 --> 25:38.100
with Pratt, the story of tales from Gavagan's Bar. I was curious about the antecedents for

25:38.100 --> 25:42.100
that kind of a frame tale, you know, with the bar and the recurring characters and so

25:42.100 --> 25:45.820
forth. Was that something you came up with yourself or was there an antecedent for that?

25:46.120 --> 25:52.000
It did have an antecedent and that was the Jorkin stories of Lord Dunsaney, of which

25:52.000 --> 26:01.420
he wrote five volumes and they include some very fine little stories indeed. I was familiar

26:01.420 --> 26:07.620
with the stories. I don't remember whether either Fletcher or I was consciously influenced

26:08.220 --> 26:14.920
by their example when we started our Gavagan's Bar series. Fletcher just said, well, let's

26:14.920 --> 26:18.740
write some short stories of this and that, sort of, late in the bar, you know, bar room

26:18.740 --> 26:24.940
tall tales. And he also would write Dunsaney and I dare say he had Jorkins at the back

26:24.940 --> 26:30.880
of his mind too. Well, by a coincidence, our friend Arthur C. Clark over in England was

26:30.880 --> 26:36.060
just beginning his Tales of the White Heart at the same time, which is also a set of bar

26:36.060 --> 26:39.940
room tall tales. Neither of us knew about what the other was doing.

26:42.320 --> 26:48.960
Okay, yeah. I thought your book, anti-dated his or was before the Tales of the White Heart.

26:49.480 --> 26:59.500
I don't know offhand what the date of publication of Tales of the White Heart was, but in any

26:59.500 --> 27:08.300
case, I do believe it's correct that both Art and Pratt and I were working on these series

27:08.300 --> 27:14.800
at the same time, at least they overlapped. After all, we wrote these stories over a period

27:14.800 --> 27:19.780
of several years before they were collected in book form. They appeared in various magazines,

27:20.880 --> 27:29.480
including the old weird tales even. Last years, it folded in 1990. I think it was a good

27:29.500 --> 27:36.700
story in 1954. Is there anything special or unique about science fiction or science fantasy

27:36.700 --> 27:43.320
that makes it a unique feel for a humorist? I mean, anything that you couldn't do in other

27:43.320 --> 27:56.560
forms of fiction? Well, you can of course because of the fact that you're much less limited

27:56.560 --> 28:03.540
as to your settings and your basic assumptions than you are in realistic fiction. It gives

28:03.540 --> 28:15.440
you unlimited opportunities for working the essential factors of humor, such as surprise

28:15.440 --> 28:26.540
and incongruity. So I'd say on the whole that it's a very good feel for humor. But

28:27.110 --> 28:34.800
in a way that certain other fields are not. For example, I have never, I don't get a laugh

28:34.800 --> 28:44.300
out of funny war stories, for example, because to me war is a pretty serious business and

28:44.710 --> 28:56.540
not a proper subject for levity. This is David Cruz, Darrell Lane and David
