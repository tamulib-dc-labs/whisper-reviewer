Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

01:04.900 --> 01:08.440
No, the radio station hasn't queued up the wrong program. This is Daryl Lane.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.980
And David Carson, and this is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

01:11.420 --> 01:15.340
Many of you undoubtedly recognize the music as being from Jim Henson's new movie, The Dark Crystal.

01:15.740 --> 01:19.280
The music was composed by Trevor Jones and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.

01:19.740 --> 01:23.420
It's a fantasy film in which the heroes, two elfin-like creatures called Gelflings,

01:23.660 --> 01:28.700
have to overcome some almost insurmountable tasks in order to keep the evil Skeksis from taking over the world.

01:28.700 --> 01:32.180
The Skeksis were not always evil. In fact, they weren't always called the Skeksis.

01:32.580 --> 01:36.860
They were once called the urSkeks, but in trying to become totally good, the urSkeks made a terrible mistake.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.500
This caused them to be split into the urRu who are good and the Skeksis who are evil.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.520
And in their first rage, the Skeksis broke a piece from a magical crystal,

01:45.800 --> 01:48.780
and the world of the urRu, Skeksis, and Gelflings became dark.

01:49.040 --> 01:52.240
And replacing the missing piece of the crystal is the quest the Gelflings undertake.

02:12.540 --> 02:16.680
The creatures used in the movie are much like the one used in the movie E.T., The Extraterrestrial.

02:16.940 --> 02:20.340
Except that Henson's crew had dozens of creatures all on the screen at the same time,

02:20.580 --> 02:22.740
which made performing them somewhat difficult at times.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.400
Henson tells us that things weren't quite as drastic as in filming the Muppet movie,

02:26.400 --> 02:31.800
where he was sealed up in a watertight drum and lowered into the swamp in order to perform Kermit singing on a log.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.120
We never had anything that was quite that claustrophobic.

02:38.820 --> 02:51.840
I mean, fortunately, I'm not a claustrophobic person, so I don't mind being
scrunched into a small space. But in the Muppet movie, we would very often find

02:51.840 --> 03:02.060
ourselves in a situation where we were out in the real world, like riding in a
taxi cab, where there might be three or four of us sort of jammed underneath

03:02.060 --> 03:14.520
where the seat would have been in a regular automobile. But since this film was
all in a fantasy world, which was designed for us to operate in, we virtually

03:14.520 --> 03:27.540
never had that same kind of discomfort. So all of our sets were designed with
knowing that we wanted to be able to get underneath the ground or through a rock

03:27.540 --> 03:35.220
wall. So all of it was designed with trap doors or areas that could be removed.

03:48.080 --> 03:57.700
The design and construction by Henson's group and artist Brian Froud was quite
an interesting process also. Brian would do an original sketch, and then

03:57.700 --> 04:12.360
we would turn that, we would go to have one of our sculptors then sculpt the
figure, and then we would mock it up so that we could manipulate it. And then we

04:12.360 --> 04:24.440
would try moving this thing, and these things moved in different ways. We would
videotape a test, and then we'd all sit around and look at the test and decide

04:24.440 --> 04:32.340
what should be done about it. And then Brian would normally redesign the
character, and the whole process would begin again.

04:45.500 --> 04:50.060
Jim Henson's new movie, The Dark Crystal, is quite a remarkable achievement. Go
see for yourself.

05:00.060 --> 05:07.960
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:07.960 --> 05:08.700
Odessa, Texas.
