00:01.240 --> 00:05.880
First of all, I was just interested in how you got started in science fiction.

00:06.120 --> 00:10.080
What drew you to the field and when you started reading it and personal things like that?

00:10.380 --> 00:16.360
Right. Well, I actually began a serious interest in science fiction after my first degree in English

00:16.360 --> 00:18.920
at the University of Singapore as it was then called.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.760
I have of course been reading science fiction for a much longer period.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.300
As you yourself know, I mean most of us get to science fiction when we are about 12 or 13

00:28.300 --> 00:31.580
and through the comics and then we graduate through the books.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.300
And by the time we are 18, we usually tuck it away, unfortunately for a while.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.520
That's what happened with me.

00:38.060 --> 00:41.540
And when I had my first degree and I was going on to do my Master's,

00:41.900 --> 00:45.700
I had thought of doing research into Indian writing and English.

00:46.300 --> 00:50.280
But my professor, who was quite keen on getting new work done,

00:50.880 --> 00:55.020
advised me to study the impact of technology on the literary imagination.

00:55.020 --> 00:57.080
And that's exactly what I did.

00:57.580 --> 01:03.820
And that's when I developed a very serious interest, began meeting authors, attending meetings, writing to people.

01:05.500 --> 01:10.120
Okay, and your present involvement in the field besides teaching, besides teaching,

01:10.220 --> 01:14.020
and of course you've written a book or two and so forth, you said you've traveled around

01:14.020 --> 01:17.060
and so forth, could you describe briefly what that entails?

01:17.300 --> 01:22.900
Right, yes. Certainly as an academic as I think is the best way of describing myself at the present moment.

01:22.900 --> 01:28.360
I get lots of opportunities to travel all over the world at conferences and meetings.

01:29.200 --> 01:35.100
And as often as I can within the broad interpretation of any one conference that might be taking place,

01:35.380 --> 01:41.800
I try to offer papers on science fiction because I do feel it's a very viable topic for discussion.

01:42.760 --> 01:49.100
And what I think needs to be done is to expose as many people as it's possible to science fiction

01:49.100 --> 01:52.600
so that they can understand and get to know what science fiction is all about.

01:53.020 --> 01:53.780
And that's what I do.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.320
Apart from teaching science fiction in the National University of Singapore now,

01:58.000 --> 02:05.060
I also edit critical essays on science fiction from all over the world and we've just brought out a book called The Stellar Gauge,

02:05.460 --> 02:12.860
which has in-depth academic analyses of about 12 authors, including some very famous ones.

02:12.860 --> 02:17.760
And our contributors are also famous like Christopher Priest, Brian Aldenst, John Slating,

02:18.660 --> 02:19.600
George Turner and the others.

02:20.460 --> 02:26.400
I also have just edited the first ever collection of science fiction short stories from Singapore.

02:27.220 --> 02:32.540
These were the best stories submitted for a first ever national wide science fiction short story competition.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.620
So that's what I do briefly.

02:35.100 --> 02:38.060
I'm also at the moment, if I may say, just adding something personally,

02:38.060 --> 02:42.480
working on a science fiction novel that would incorporate all my travelings all over the world,

02:42.700 --> 02:46.620
my readings up to now, some speculations that I have about the future,

02:47.380 --> 02:51.980
discussions and meetings with various science fiction authors like Arthur Clarke, Brian Aldenst, Jack Wilmsen and others.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.800
You will have Singapore as its direct setting, but the whole world as a background.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.580
I look forward to that.

02:59.660 --> 03:00.580
Sure need encouragement.

03:01.540 --> 03:04.720
Your book, Wonder and Awe, The World of Science Fiction,

03:05.400 --> 03:09.820
briefly, what was the theme or the purpose or the central idea of that publication?

03:10.400 --> 03:16.440
Right. That is actually a prelude to a much bigger book that I'm working on called Science Fiction and the Literary Imagination.

03:18.780 --> 03:25.100
In Wonder and Awe, what I basically try to do is to expose a lot of the fallacies, I think,

03:25.540 --> 03:28.940
that are associated with science fiction and with science fiction criticism,

03:28.980 --> 03:31.560
particularly on the part of mainstream literary critics.

03:31.560 --> 03:40.840
And I argue, I think, quite vehemently, case for the validity and legitimization of science fiction as literature today.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.240
That's a basic theme of that. It's a very small book.

03:45.340 --> 03:51.060
You feel in that the distinction between science fiction and mainstream is an artificial or a useless one,

03:51.120 --> 03:53.700
that they should be one, considered one, the same thing?

03:54.220 --> 03:59.560
I think ultimately the distinctions ought to disappear, frankly,

04:00.540 --> 04:08.100
because the more we try to erect these boundaries, the more we get into trouble to water us,

04:08.180 --> 04:12.520
because as we all know, categories are, by their very nature, exclusive.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.660
And when they become too exclusive, as I think the case has been with science fiction for a long time,

04:19.420 --> 04:25.220
what develops is the hightest, and that could lead to a breakdown in communication rather than an integration.

04:25.220 --> 04:31.640
And I think one of the reasons why perhaps science fiction has not quite enjoyed the kind of status that it ought to,

04:31.920 --> 04:40.300
as a valid and viable form of literature in our time, is the fact that too often, and by too many people,

04:40.560 --> 04:45.540
it has been very zealously and jealously guarded as something exclusive,

04:46.220 --> 04:51.260
something that one entered with a great deal of trepidation, things like that.

04:51.260 --> 04:55.940
So yes, I think ultimately there has to be an elimination of the categories.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.520
As Brian already says, science fiction is literature.

05:01.460 --> 05:05.520
Could you give some examples of the influences that have kept them separate?

05:05.660 --> 05:08.600
You mean things like fans, the publishing industry, or what kind of...

05:08.600 --> 05:11.600
Yes, I think fans to a large extent explain the exclusiveness.

05:12.340 --> 05:15.620
As we are witnessing in this will convention here in Denver itself,

05:16.900 --> 05:22.300
one of the things that I notice most readily is the fact that a lot of the fans are not really,

05:22.360 --> 05:24.860
I think, very keen on a serious discussion of science fiction.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.500
They're here to have a good time, and that's a very good thing in itself.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.220
I mean, I think people ought to have a good time.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.560
But at the same time, they mustn't then go on and complain that,

05:33.760 --> 05:38.020
oh, you know, we are regarded as freaks, as people on our own individual trips,

05:38.060 --> 05:43.280
because I think in some ways we SF enthusiasts invite that kind of charge or accusation.

05:44.300 --> 05:48.240
I also feel that a lot of the science fiction writers are themselves responsible for this.

05:49.540 --> 05:53.240
I've talked personally with a number of them, and I've heard many of them speaking,

05:53.440 --> 05:56.740
and I've read what they have said in fanzines and things.

05:57.220 --> 05:58.760
They do want to keep this kind of thing going,

05:58.900 --> 06:05.720
because the science fiction writers feel that they are commercially viable only in so far as they have got a large fan following.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.320
And if they have a large fan following, then they feel that they can sell.

06:09.320 --> 06:17.700
Now, the same writers also lament the fact that serious critics at the universities, in colleges and all,

06:18.060 --> 06:19.580
are not taking them seriously.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.940
But I want to question that, because to a large extent I think it's part of their own making.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.080
And they don't put enough effort and serious struggle into the work,

06:29.500 --> 06:33.120
and therefore the outcome of it is quite mediocre, to say the least.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.660
It seemed to me to be a very rare author in today's world though,

06:36.720 --> 06:40.580
who would dedicate his life to writing significant works when he could make some money.

06:41.540 --> 06:42.680
Yes, yes.

06:43.220 --> 06:46.520
Nevertheless, I do think that the world of science fiction, I think,

06:46.560 --> 06:50.180
reveals an astounding number of very young people who have made it good overnight.

06:51.300 --> 06:56.780
People who are much below 40 have already got established reputations in the world of SF.

06:58.740 --> 07:02.140
I'm not to be accused of being extra conservative or something,

07:02.140 --> 07:10.100
but I do feel that it needs a lot of time and serious effort if you want to establish yourself as an author for posterity.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.900
You have your fans, you have your books, and you have your novels, and your publishers, and your money.

07:16.380 --> 07:19.860
But I think all this would disappear the moment you die,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.080
or the moment what you write about becomes outdated.

07:22.260 --> 07:25.860
One of the reasons why SF writers are so eager to get book of the book coming out,

07:25.920 --> 07:28.320
is that the book of the book goes out of date so fast.

07:28.820 --> 07:32.780
And this is, I think, what they really mean when people talk about the pulp world of SF.

07:34.600 --> 07:39.080
You've spoken of the need for a strong literary voice,

07:39.200 --> 07:46.760
or responsible critical impetus or influence to make science fiction respectable and so forth.

07:46.840 --> 07:47.640
Could you explain that briefly?

07:47.900 --> 07:49.540
Yes, if I could draw an analogy.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.780
I think those of us who have been engaged in the study of English literature

07:53.780 --> 07:59.480
know how difficult it has been for any other literature written in English to make any kind of headway,

07:59.720 --> 08:05.620
given the big, rich heritage of English literature itself coming down from Chaucer, downwinds.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.220
In my university in Singapore for a long time, even American literature was taboo,

08:10.600 --> 08:16.200
because the professor there didn't believe that much American literature, and I mean the classics,

08:16.720 --> 08:22.780
really offered anything significant to those who were interested in doing literature as a subject.

08:23.820 --> 08:29.580
Now that's a kind of resistance that I think good critics, and with the reference to American literature,

08:29.740 --> 08:33.120
I think the good critics that really put American literature on the world map,

08:33.460 --> 08:39.100
and made all of us aware of the potential of American literature were people like Edmund Wilson,

08:39.740 --> 08:40.660
people like Lionel Trilling.

08:41.260 --> 08:48.340
I think what they did for American literature is what is necessary at the current time for science fiction.

08:48.940 --> 08:56.300
And as I cast my eyes around the world, I don't think there are people with that kind of calibre

08:56.300 --> 09:00.600
who are seriously engaged in science fiction criticism,

09:00.920 --> 09:07.500
because I do think you need a good, viable, critical tradition to give strength and body

09:07.500 --> 09:13.580
to the, or at least do the selecting, which is very essential to the body of science fiction itself.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.740
And of course that leads to another question. I've heard your ideas on this before.

09:19.980 --> 09:24.620
What is it that prevents responsible critics from approaching science fiction?

09:26.100 --> 09:32.720
Oh, I think primarily, as I'm going to repeat myself, it's, you know, but primarily there are two reasons.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.920
One is this whole thing about science fiction being an exclusive thing, and as I said at the talk today,

09:39.040 --> 09:45.820
science fiction fandom and authors and publishers and all tend to regard themselves as a little colony.

09:47.080 --> 09:51.700
And much as they don't try to colonize others, they also resent any kind of intrusion from the outside world.

09:52.240 --> 09:57.560
Now that of course puts a serious literary critic on his guard and on his defensive, you know,

09:57.580 --> 10:02.980
creates a kind of defensive posture, because the moment he wants to make an incursion into the world of science fiction,

10:03.120 --> 10:06.520
he's dismissed as being yet another academic who's trying to bullshit his way through.

10:07.100 --> 10:11.680
And that's one opposition that's from within SF, and I think the second is from within themselves.

10:11.960 --> 10:19.680
I mean, most literary critics that I know of, and this is again why I stress the fact that there aren't people of the caliber of people at Lionel Trilling,

10:20.100 --> 10:23.900
most literary critics I know of are pretty narrow-minded and very set in their views,

10:24.160 --> 10:30.120
and it's very difficult to convince them that there is very viable stuff in SF.

10:31.800 --> 10:36.500
And as a result of which they are ignorant, they do not know what's happening in the real world of science fiction.

10:37.080 --> 10:45.520
And because of this great sort of idea, great image that is created of SF as being something for young people,

10:46.120 --> 10:49.740
something that is only exciting to the scientists or those who are scientifically inclined,

10:50.440 --> 10:52.340
a lot of literary critics just keep themselves away.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.700
I think they look themselves out from this very exciting world of SF.

10:56.780 --> 11:05.180
You think then that SF significant literary works can be written in the SF mode?

11:05.480 --> 11:11.480
Oh, certainly. More certainly. I mean, after all, what is literature but an exquisite fusion of thoughts with emotion?

11:12.260 --> 11:17.260
What we have mostly in SF is a thought without, I think, the accompanying emotion.

11:18.100 --> 11:21.380
But these also mean that a lot of the language that is faulty in SF,

11:21.380 --> 11:28.020
I think that's the main reason why literary critics do not want to talk too much about SF or take it too seriously.

11:28.620 --> 11:38.940
The main fault, as I see it, is that a lot of the language in SF novels or SF short stories does not measure up to any kind of enrichment.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.660
It doesn't enrich the imagination at all.

11:43.320 --> 11:49.940
There are lots of ideas and ideas upon ideas, but in order to be considered literature, you need something beyond that.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.960
And this is where SF has a very viable role to play.

11:53.580 --> 12:03.380
If we can get an author who is able to use language with the amount of versatility and talent and skill that a lot of the so-called mainstream writers can do,

12:03.740 --> 12:12.140
then I think there's a lot of scope because then you really would have the backup of your ideas as well as your imaginative expression of this.

12:12.280 --> 12:17.260
What I'm saying in a roundabout way is that too much of SF tends to be superficial and too simplistic.

12:17.260 --> 12:21.180
There's not enough metaphor. There isn't enough metaphorical language.

12:21.480 --> 12:25.840
A symbol is not a symbol in a SF book. It is exactly what it's meant to be.

12:26.300 --> 12:33.940
Therefore, SF, if we may use it in a linguistic jargon here, a lot of SF is merely denotational and not connotational.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.640
It doesn't connot anything, it just denotes.

12:38.740 --> 12:42.080
Is that what you meant before when you said that SF doesn't transcend?

12:42.080 --> 12:47.200
Yes. This is why so much of SF becomes obsolete.

12:48.220 --> 12:58.020
There's too much attention, too much ostentatious attention paid to scientific detail, scientific accuracy, new technological breakthroughs and things.

12:58.200 --> 13:02.800
So that the imagination is sapped up by the facts rather than fiction.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.540
So that what happens in SF is that science takes over the fiction.

13:06.340 --> 13:09.380
And to be established as literature, I think it's the fiction that needs to prevail.

13:11.800 --> 13:19.840
You said a moment ago, and most anybody would agree with this, I think that SF is based on ideas or plot and so forth.

13:21.080 --> 13:24.480
And it's therefore weak on character and things like that.

13:25.500 --> 13:35.920
Do you think that if a serious mainstream writer or say a serious writer attempted to infuse mainstream values into a literature of ideas,

13:36.800 --> 13:44.360
would that destroy SF as we know it? Would that take away its charm, its vitality, and we would have something new that wouldn't be SF?

13:45.080 --> 13:54.580
I think those of us who feel that that is the only distinction that differentiates or the only characteristic that differentiates SF for mainstream,

13:55.520 --> 13:58.900
I think for those of us who believe in that, yes, we will be disappointed.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.220
But I think that would be a very narrow view of SF itself, though.

14:03.880 --> 14:04.760
Put it this way.

14:05.380 --> 14:13.200
Are we to assume that all the things that say somebody like Kurt Vonnegut has written, or somebody like Ursula Le Guin has written,

14:13.820 --> 14:20.760
or somebody like Walter Miller has written, are we to assume that these three authors, for example, are no longer writing science fiction

14:20.760 --> 14:24.500
because they're trying to infuse their work with the qualities of mainstream fiction?

14:25.120 --> 14:26.540
I think the immediate answer would be no.

14:27.180 --> 14:38.400
And yet, from a different perspective, I feel that, yes, the superficial attraction of SF for a lot of people would be gone.

14:39.660 --> 14:44.940
I mean, if you're only interested in reading a book as to know what happens next, what happens next, I mean, that's the only reason.

14:46.060 --> 14:48.820
Then I think your appetite would be very soon vetted.

14:51.060 --> 15:00.000
Do you think that the so-called New Wave movement in SF a few years back, do you think that did anything to bring SF closer to mainstream?

15:00.440 --> 15:04.960
Because they were, as I read, the much more interested in character and symbol and so forth.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.520
Was that a benefit? Did you see that as something beneficial in the field?

15:08.340 --> 15:17.800
Yes and no. I think whenever something gets caught on in a kind of bandwagon, the detectants or the people who just jump onto the bandwagon

15:17.800 --> 15:22.800
in order to make a name for themselves, these are, I think, the real detractors.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.400
Though they may not appear to be detractors, I consider them detractors because they're just opportunistic.

15:28.280 --> 15:34.800
I mean, they can do a lot of damage, though I think that people like Michael Mocog and Brian Aldis have done some very good work

15:34.800 --> 15:40.700
in terms of trying to make science fiction into literature and trying to create a very viable literature.

15:40.700 --> 15:50.380
I might add at this point that, something that I've spoken to you before about, that as science and technology moves into the soft areas,

15:51.180 --> 15:56.880
into the areas of behavioural sciences, like biology or physiology or brain research and things like that,

15:57.280 --> 16:05.000
I think that's when the good literature from science fiction would emerge because then the SF writers would be forced to consider

16:06.120 --> 16:09.760
the interior landscape of a human being and not merely the exterior.

16:09.940 --> 16:15.420
I think too much attention at the moment is being paid on the external environment without giving enough focus to the internal.

16:16.280 --> 16:22.020
And as science and technology moves, I mean science and technology has more or less made man the master of this environment,

16:22.620 --> 16:29.940
but now technology is all trying to make man the master of himself as technology and science itself moves with all its machinery and apparatus

16:29.940 --> 16:34.120
into the human mind and drives the probe into areas unknown before.

16:34.780 --> 16:38.900
Likewise, the science fiction writers would also follow and I think that's when a new spur might come.

16:42.040 --> 16:45.680
Just to follow this, probably my last question in this area.

16:47.900 --> 16:56.480
Do you feel there is a need for an escapist literature that is there purely for escape and with no significance beyond that?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.460
Does it have any value or is there a need for that?

17:00.260 --> 17:05.500
Yes, I think we all need escapes and reading a good book is escape enough.

17:06.080 --> 17:08.600
Now, put a question another way.

17:09.540 --> 17:16.400
If I were to read, say, The Tempest by Shakespeare or The Miller's Tale by Chaucer, which you are yourself an expert,

17:17.120 --> 17:21.560
I mean, would that not be a tent of a kind of escape given the 20th century?

17:23.160 --> 17:27.480
I think it's not so much the need for escape that I'm questioning, but the quality of that escape.

17:28.400 --> 17:33.040
I think some escapes are better than others as some escapades are more exciting than others.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.940
And that's what I'm really questioning.

17:35.120 --> 17:39.880
I think there is fantasy and there's horror movies and horror things and whatnot,

17:40.120 --> 17:45.900
but I think ultimately science fiction, I mean, in the 20th century from one point of view,

17:46.080 --> 17:49.980
everything that we do is escapist because, you know, how are we to confront reality anyway?

17:49.980 --> 17:54.180
Too much reality does us no good, as Eliot pointed out long time ago.

17:55.820 --> 18:03.900
So I think there is a genuine need for the escape, but if science fiction could provide a more qualitative escape

18:03.900 --> 18:09.780
for minds to engage themselves, you know, and come back again and again to a point of reference,

18:10.120 --> 18:14.500
then I think we would see science fiction as really drawing and developing into maturity.

18:15.940 --> 18:21.740
In your travels and your lectures and so forth, the places you go to, could you comment on the differences

18:21.740 --> 18:25.320
or the similarities, I'm not sure what there would be between, say, the fandom,

18:26.080 --> 18:29.200
the environment surrounding science fiction in other countries versus America?

18:29.360 --> 18:30.280
Is there a big difference there?

18:30.880 --> 18:32.500
Not very much from what I'm seeing.

18:33.040 --> 18:37.320
Fans all over the world, and this is the unique thing I think about science fiction,

18:37.580 --> 18:41.860
fans all over the world are absolute devotees of the field.

18:41.860 --> 18:44.060
I mean, there's no question about that.

18:44.260 --> 18:49.660
Fans everywhere in Singapore, in Malaya, in India, in Australia, New Zealand, England, America,

18:50.160 --> 18:54.860
they all show the same kind of fervor, vitality, gusto in their approach to science fiction.

18:55.820 --> 19:04.160
What I have noticed is that in America, among the academics, there seems to be now at least somewhat less

19:04.160 --> 19:10.620
of a resistance to the teaching of science fiction in the university to having science fiction causes on their curriculum.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.260
In England, I think the breakthrough is gradually being made.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.700
We've got some fine people in England working seriously in the science fiction area.

19:19.460 --> 19:24.160
In Australia, I think generally there's still a good deal of conservatism.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.920
New Zealand is almost absolutely conservative.

19:29.040 --> 19:34.020
In Singapore itself, while I do what I can for science fiction, there's a whole unit on that, at the university.

19:35.420 --> 19:39.060
So, I don't think there's any difference between fans all over the world,

19:39.160 --> 19:44.180
but the differences come at the level of the serious reader, science fiction.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.260
I don't mean to imply that fans are not serious readers,

19:47.540 --> 19:52.380
but I don't think they read science fiction the way in which an academic would want to read it

19:52.380 --> 19:54.880
or the way in which a literary critic would want to do it.

19:56.400 --> 20:02.840
I have to confess a great deal of ignorance about oriental science fiction, period.

20:06.420 --> 20:10.900
In fact, I would even have to ask, is there a body of oriental science fiction,

20:11.380 --> 20:16.580
and is it different than what American readers would know in science fiction?

20:16.960 --> 20:21.200
Yeah, I think there's going to be some very good things coming out from China

20:22.420 --> 20:27.100
when more and more of the stuff that Chinese are writing becomes available in English.

20:27.340 --> 20:32.240
Since I myself don't read Chinese, I rely on the translations and what my Chinese friends tell me.

20:32.240 --> 20:37.080
I think there we're going to see a kind of science fiction that is free

20:37.080 --> 20:40.700
of the obvious influence either of British or American SF.

20:41.500 --> 20:45.980
Now, at the moment, the one country in Asia that has a lot of science fiction is Japan,

20:46.520 --> 20:51.060
and because of the close links between Japan and America, that also shows in its literature,

20:51.720 --> 20:55.840
Japanese SF is not quite different from American SF.

20:56.460 --> 20:59.320
Though I think the science fiction that's being written in Singapore, say,

20:59.320 --> 21:03.680
or the science fiction in India, and this might be also a reflection of our links with Britain,

21:04.760 --> 21:07.460
we reveal more of British influence.

21:08.360 --> 21:15.080
And in some ways, I don't want to, how should I say it?

21:15.260 --> 21:20.160
I would immediately, I think, beg indulgence and forgiveness if I step on many toes here.

21:20.660 --> 21:27.100
I do think that a lot of American SF tends unfortunately to be a little more gimmicky

21:27.500 --> 21:29.320
than, say, the British science fiction.

21:29.440 --> 21:34.380
I do feel that the British SF writers do take themselves a little more seriously as art,

21:34.580 --> 21:37.940
as writers of literature than the American SF writers.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.820
And this is not to cast aspersion because they are, of course, exceptions.

21:41.440 --> 21:47.600
And some of the best science fiction, both criticism and fiction, has been actually written in America.

21:47.820 --> 21:55.160
But I do think that on the whole, America tends to be a little more taken up with immediate returns

21:55.160 --> 21:58.460
and immediate returns, the more sensational you are, the more gimmicky you are,

21:58.860 --> 22:00.380
the more immediately you make an impact.

22:01.360 --> 22:07.560
But as I say, the more quickly you receive your recognition, the more quickly you also tend to lose it.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.100
Singapore science fiction, was that the title of the...

22:13.100 --> 22:14.360
Yes, of the anthology, yes.

22:14.460 --> 22:18.560
Okay, now, would those writers in that anthology be all from Singapore?

22:18.840 --> 22:20.200
I mean, was that put together or is that online?

22:20.200 --> 22:21.460
Yes, it was confined only to Singaporeans.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.460
Could you expose it to contests, put the book together?

22:23.460 --> 22:23.620
Yes.

22:23.620 --> 22:24.340
Could you explain that?

22:24.360 --> 22:28.560
Yes, Singapore science fiction is a collection of 14 short stories that I've edited.

22:29.300 --> 22:36.120
These were the best, the prize-winning short stories in the national competition we had on short stories,

22:36.320 --> 22:38.160
science fiction short story competition in 1918.

22:39.020 --> 22:44.540
And I had invited Brian Aldis over to Singapore to read some of the scripts and give us his comments.

22:45.380 --> 22:46.680
He thought it was very good.

22:46.820 --> 22:53.220
In fact, he's got a forward to the anthology, in which he says we're the fiction of Southeast Asia and Singapore.

22:53.220 --> 22:59.660
It's going to blaze an over-like onto the universe, you know, in that very exuberant terminology of his.

23:02.040 --> 23:07.280
They're mainly written by young people, and that's exciting.

23:07.740 --> 23:12.400
Though I must say that the first and second prize went to people who are really in their 40s,

23:12.480 --> 23:18.540
and I think there are at least five stories in Singapore science fiction,

23:18.540 --> 23:22.720
which could measure up to good science fiction short stories anywhere in the world today.

23:23.640 --> 23:28.540
The other eight tend to be a little derivative and imitative.

23:29.860 --> 23:35.260
And there, all kinds of influences are revealed, mainly in British, but also very pronounced American influence.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.960
But then that's again another problem with science fiction all over the world.

23:39.420 --> 23:42.240
I mean, there's a lot of imitation and derivation, isn't there?

23:46.680 --> 23:54.560
I'm kind of curious to know who you would consider as being in your terms a good science fiction writer.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.760
You mentioned Miller and Ursula Lagoine already.

23:57.280 --> 23:57.900
Could you name some others?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.100
Say contemporary writers who you would respect.

24:00.580 --> 24:01.220
Contemporary.

24:01.480 --> 24:01.680
Yeah.

24:02.480 --> 24:08.060
I think Elizabeth Lynn might make it if she continues to persevere in the craft.

24:10.140 --> 24:13.100
I'm a little sorry as to what's happening to Ray Bradbury,

24:13.320 --> 24:15.460
because I haven't seen anything from him for a while.

24:18.220 --> 24:23.280
As I look around, I don't think I see much beyond that.

24:23.420 --> 24:33.540
I think the field is still dominated by people like Hal Clemence and Michael Mocock and others across the Atlantic.

24:33.540 --> 24:41.120
But I don't see, frankly speaking, any young writer on the horizon who could make a breakthrough.

24:43.340 --> 24:45.980
Or if there is, I'm ignorant unfortunately.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.400
I'm going to ask this from my own knowledge.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.600
I'm not going to put this on the air.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.600
But have you read any of Joe Haldeman?

24:52.180 --> 24:52.300
No.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.320
The forever war I was going to ask about.

24:55.420 --> 25:00.100
It seemed to me that would almost meet your requirements of a mainstream science fiction.

25:00.100 --> 25:00.380
Okay.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.320
Guys, let's see if I've gotten any more here.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.400
I've gotten a lot of good material so far.

25:19.480 --> 25:23.820
I think Angela Carter, by the way, does something quite good among the women writers.

25:24.720 --> 25:25.160
Angela Carter.

25:25.200 --> 25:25.860
I don't know her at all.

25:26.040 --> 25:26.440
Fireworks.

25:26.800 --> 25:27.780
Anthology called fireworks.

25:28.820 --> 25:34.660
The distinctions may not always be very clear because she is more in the realm of fantasy than science fiction.

25:35.280 --> 25:39.060
Oh yes, of course, there is a contemporary science fiction writer that I do want to put a plug for.

25:39.380 --> 25:40.180
That's Philip K. Dick.

25:41.080 --> 25:51.620
I think Philip K. Dick is producing work which not only challenges all the assumptions of science fiction, as we know it hitherto,

25:51.620 --> 25:58.440
but he's also writing work that would make the categories between mainstream and science fiction disappear.

25:58.880 --> 26:02.200
Because I think he really is right into the fusion of the two.

26:02.920 --> 26:06.600
And of course, all this in England I think is doing some very good work.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.900
And I would also mention Stanislaw Lem, who was from Europe.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.960
And somebody like Christopher Priest.

26:13.900 --> 26:19.340
Though I wish Priest spent just a little more time getting his thoughts more coagently organised.

26:21.760 --> 26:25.020
We're just about out of tape. Let me ask a couple of questions. This is It Runs Down.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.860
Okay, now you've mentioned, you said you are working on a novel.

26:31.380 --> 26:31.540
Yes.

26:31.580 --> 26:34.960
And your book Wonder and Awe was simply a prelude to a longer work.

26:35.080 --> 26:35.320
Yes.

26:36.240 --> 26:42.000
What else do you envision? I mean, what kinds of writing or work? Do you see yourself doing?

26:42.000 --> 26:42.280
On a personal level?

26:42.380 --> 26:43.420
Oh yes, on a personal level.

26:43.420 --> 26:47.400
Well, quite frankly, Darrell, I'm very eclectic in my taste.

26:47.400 --> 26:52.440
I've also published quite extensively in Commonwealth literature, what they call New Literatures in English.

26:53.180 --> 26:57.000
And I've looked, I've done a book on Patrick White, the Australian Nobel Prize winning novelist.

26:58.540 --> 27:02.620
I'm increasingly, I'm working on a book on a Malaysian writer, Yi Pyong Hong.

27:03.800 --> 27:09.320
And I also, devil in poetry, so my second volume of verse is coming out shortly.

27:10.060 --> 27:12.940
I'm doing a critical study of all South Asian literature in English.

27:13.400 --> 27:18.820
And as far as science fiction goes, I'm going, I'm working on a big study of the work of Arthur C. Clarke.

27:20.580 --> 27:23.200
That would be a, what a critical study of his work?

27:23.360 --> 27:27.480
Yes, a critical analysis of Clarke's work.

27:27.640 --> 27:28.460
You admire his work?

27:30.080 --> 27:31.280
To a good extent, yes.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.740
Not the novels with which he's usually associated.

27:34.960 --> 27:38.680
I think that Clarke has produced some very good work.

27:38.680 --> 27:44.620
What I question sometimes is his faith in science and technology to cure the ills of mankind.

27:45.560 --> 27:50.420
But I do think that in his earlier work, and in some of the later ones, like Rondeau Gourmet Rama,

27:50.980 --> 27:57.000
I think he does try to attempt some kind of stylistic elegance.

27:58.100 --> 28:02.420
You know, I mean, Arthur Clarke is now very rich and he can write a novel, take his time, relax.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.860
And I think this is very important. I want to say this earlier, but, you know,

28:06.860 --> 28:11.740
I think a lot of science fiction writers, the reason why they don't seem to produce work that's sustained

28:11.740 --> 28:15.500
is the fact that they write from a very anxious angle.

28:15.780 --> 28:19.920
They're very anxious whether the fans are going to receive it well, they're anxious whether they're going to get published,

28:20.080 --> 28:21.900
how the editors are going to respond and things like that.

28:22.260 --> 28:27.320
And I think too much anxiety doesn't do good because the spontaneity is lost,

28:28.260 --> 28:30.440
the natural flow of the language is lost.

28:30.980 --> 28:34.820
And when a man is uptight, I don't think we're looking at him at his best.

28:36.980 --> 28:44.160
Let me just ask a pursuitist for a second here. You said that this book, Wonder and Awe, would be leading to a larger work.

28:44.660 --> 28:48.990
Would that be an expansion of your ideas regarding criticism and the need for it and the approach it...

28:49.320 --> 28:53.840
Yes, because Wonder and Awe, I've been very interested in all the reviews that Wonder and Awe has got,

28:53.960 --> 28:58.200
and I've gained more insight into my own critical thinking around the subject.

28:58.940 --> 29:02.860
When I was working on Wonder and Awe, I corresponded with people like David Kettler and Northrop Fry,

29:02.860 --> 29:08.380
who I think have offered something quite seminal in literary criticism of science fiction and Robert Conquest.

29:08.560 --> 29:12.700
I think these are the pioneers of genuine literary criticism as far as science fiction goes.

29:13.380 --> 29:22.960
And what I want to do now is put all these thoughts together and apply a lot of the critical things that I've fed them over the publication of Wonder

29:22.960 --> 29:24.580
and the reviews subsequently.

29:25.260 --> 29:29.460
I want to put all these together and apply them to specific authors in science fiction.

29:30.140 --> 29:36.280
And I think it might take about three or four years for it to come out, but I'm very interested in that.

29:37.280 --> 29:43.220
It also, by the way, would be an expansion of my own master's thesis, which was entitled Technology and the Modern Novel.

29:44.040 --> 29:52.160
And the kind of questions that I'm interested in asking myself now, a good writer would naturally take into account man's environment,

29:52.500 --> 29:54.960
and if man's environment is changing, he has to reckon with that.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.180
Now, science fiction does that exemplarily.

29:58.540 --> 30:05.660
How does, for example, the novels of A.C. Clarke that incorporate all the new adventures of space travel or cloning and things,

30:06.120 --> 30:10.740
how do they differ in their literary impact from, say, the novels of D.H. Lawrence,

30:11.060 --> 30:14.520
who was also saying that a mechanical civilization is screwing the world up?

30:15.080 --> 30:17.720
That's the kind of comparisons that I want to do and work into.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.900
That's great. Okay, I think... Yeah, I better turn that off.

30:22.060 --> 30:22.760
We're just about out.

30:23.020 --> 30:25.020
Thanks a lot. Thank you very much for the opportunity.

30:25.020 --> 30:27.100
I've been stuck for hours. That's fascinating.
