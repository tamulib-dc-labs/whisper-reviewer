00:00.840 --> 00:07.240
12, 11, 10, 9, we have this ignition sequence start.

00:07.240 --> 00:42.420

00:42.420 --> 01:06.420
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. All engines running. Liftoff!

01:06.420 --> 01:07.640
In the training section,

01:14.460 --> 01:20.640
the Apollo, Saturn V, the Apollo, Saturn V, the Apollo, Saturn V, For the lunar
landing, the Apollo Saturn V configuration consisted of two basic sections. The

01:20.640 --> 01:29.420
Saturn V booster for Earth launch and departure to the Moon, and a lunar flight
system for operations at the Moon. The lunar flight system consisted of two

01:29.420 --> 01:37.120
modules, one for lunar orbit operations and Earth return, the command and
service module, and the other for lunar landing and launch, the lunar module.

01:38.540 --> 01:45.960
The lunar module consisted of two stages, the descent stage for the landing and
the ascent stage for the launch and rendezvous with the command and service

01:45.960 --> 01:55.740
modules. The lunar flight system was injected into a translunar trajectory by
the final stage of the Saturn booster. Upon arrival at the Moon, the command

01:55.740 --> 02:05.040
module inserted the combined vehicles into a circular orbit which passed over
the landing site at an altitude of 60 nautical miles. Prior to landing, two

02:05.040 --> 02:13.980
astronauts transferred from the command module to the lunar module, the third
remained in the command module. The lunar module then separated from the command

02:13.980 --> 02:23.100
module, and at the appropriate point in the lunar orbit, initiated the powered
descent maneuver, using the main engine on the descent stage. The approach phase

02:23.100 --> 02:30.540
of the lunar module power descent begins at a point, or high gate, above and
approaching the landing point where the pilot has visual contact with the

02:30.540 --> 02:39.800
landing area. When the lunar module arrives at low gate, approximately 200
meters altitude, it pitches forward to a near vertical descent during which the

02:39.800 --> 02:49.860
pilot takes over from the automatic control for the final touchdown. The time
from low gate to touchdown is nominally about two minutes. The planetary landing

02:49.860 --> 02:59.700
vehicle is designed to replace the Lunar Module for delivery of very small
payloads to a planetary surface. The PLV consists of two stages originally

02:59.700 --> 03:09.200
developed by the Department of Defense for Ballistic Missile Defense. This
direct conversion of Department of Defense technology to space exploration is

03:09.200 --> 03:17.220
enabled by the almost identical energy requirements of a lunar landing by the
Lunar Module and a space-based missile intercept by DOD kinetic kill vehicle

03:17.220 --> 03:28.500
KKV. This fortuitous analogy of equivalent energy capabilities enables the
flight profile of the KKV PLV to overlay the flight profile of the Lunar module

03:28.500 --> 03:38.620
with only minor adjustments to the KKV flight profile. The descent stage of the
two-stage PLV is separated at LOGATE where the PLV landing stage is ignited for

03:38.620 --> 03:48.460
the final vertical descent-in-landing. The descent stage proceeds off-range for
disposal. The final phase of landing and touchdown by a PLV was verified in an

03:48.460 --> 03:58.100
actual flight demonstration using a modified KKV test vehicle. This Advanced
Concept Architecture Test, or ACAT, was conducted at the Air Force Phillips

03:58.100 --> 04:02.000
Laboratory National Hover Test Facility on September 1, 1993.

04:14.340 --> 04:24.300
Kinetic vehicles, or KVs, are the backbone of Rocketdyne's kinetic energy
weapons program. A requirement exists to develop this defense system to protect

04:24.300 --> 04:34.880
America's assets from a potential foreign threat. A KV is a unique defensive
weapon in that it can destroy a threat through impact alone. This is achieved at

04:34.880 --> 04:45.140
very high velocities. Essentially, it's a smart, self-propelled bullet with its
own logic. And since the KV carries no warhead, we've been able to keep it small

04:45.140 --> 04:57.220
in size. A major milestone in KV technology was achieved in July 1990 when
Rocketdyne successfully hovered its Advanced Hover Interceptor Test, or A-HIT,

04:57.340 --> 05:08.320
vehicle. It marked the first flight of a lightweight, 38-pound, fully-autonomous
KV. A Hit not only flew its mission, but acquired and locked on to a target

05:08.320 --> 05:16.780
without any commands from ground control. Up until now, this had never before
been achieved. The test demonstrated the capability of a fully integrated

05:16.780 --> 05:27.060
vehicle, including all necessary subsystems required for KV operation.
Rocketdyne now has a fully functional autonomous vehicle whose size is ideally

05:27.060 --> 05:36.840
suited for current and future DoD programs, like the ground-based interceptor,
or GBI, and brilliant pebbles. This technology also applies to other spin-off

05:36.840 --> 05:46.260
programs currently under consideration. Through our recent AHIT test success,
we've been able to prove that the KV attitude control system is capable of

05:46.260 --> 05:55.440
maintaining the kind of stability required in order to intercept an actual
moving target in space. This kind of control is essential to an operational

05:55.440 --> 06:05.040
system. At the same time, we've demonstrated the ability of the visible seeker
to acquire and track a target under actual flight conditions, and it only weighs

06:05.040 --> 06:14.720
5 pounds. In an effort to reduce potential risk associated with the hover
flight, we performed a series of attitude control tests in advance on the

06:14.720 --> 06:24.220
vehicle. They were the first in a series of tests involving the integration of
several subsystems into one. The vehicle was balanced on a pivot while a

06:24.220 --> 06:34.060
disturbance was introduced. Using its pre-programmed logic, the vehicle quickly
recovered its initial position. The A-hit static test demonstrated a hot-fire

06:34.060 --> 06:44.100
strap-down test of a full-up, lightweight propulsion system. All systems
operated properly, and all test objectives were met. This was the exact

06:44.100 --> 06:53.640
propulsion system that was used to control the hover vehicle's trajectory and
position during flight. The result of all these tests represents a whole new

06:53.640 --> 07:05.920
generation of hover vehicles. Rocketdyne has gone from a 220-pound vehicle known
as On-Target to our 38-pound A-Hit vehicle in less than a year. We fabricated

07:05.920 --> 07:17.700
and fully integrated the vehicle with several major subsystems. These include
the seeker, the image processor, avionics, telemetry, and the propulsion system.

07:19.220 --> 07:28.100
To convert the A-Hit hover test vehicle directly to a planetary landing test
vehicle, only three relatively minor modifications were required. First, the

07:28.100 --> 07:36.780
avionics guidance laws were changed to enable the AHIT to perform a precisely
controlled descent from its hover position. Second, legs were added for the

07:36.780 --> 07:47.560
landing touchdown. Third, the AHIT Seeker hardware was replaced with a payload
compartment and small surface payload. Using the modified AHIT vehicle, the ACAT

07:47.560 --> 07:57.920
flight demonstration on September 1, 1993 included the complete sequence of a a
controlled descent from hover using the vertical divert engine, be touchdown at

07:57.920 --> 08:06.760
a landing point well within the capabilities of the lightweight legs, and c,
ejection of the service payload. The Ulysses mission is designed to conform

08:06.760 --> 08:15.360
precisely to Apollo. The Ulysses designed reference mission is based on the use
of a standard Titan II space launch vehicle to carry a cargo comparable to the

08:15.360 --> 08:25.220
Apollo command module and lunar module vehicles the command module is replaced
by a lunar service vehicle for lunar orbit insertion and lunar orbit operations

08:25.220 --> 08:35.640
the lunar module is replaced by the planetary landing vehicle two of which can
be launched by a single titan 2 the Ulysses lunar orbit configuration just as

08:35.640 --> 08:44.160
Apollo consists of an orbiting vehicle and a landing vehicle two in the case of
the Ulysses design reference mission the The orbiting lunar service vehicle is a

08:44.160 --> 08:54.520
conventional small satellite used for lunar orbit insertion and after departure
of the PLVs, communications relay from the lunar surface to the Earth. Each

08:54.520 --> 09:04.320
planetary landing vehicle is comprised of a two-stage KKV, in which the second
stage carries the surface payloads. Similar to the KKV concept, the first stage

09:04.320 --> 09:14.780
of the PLV or Descent stage provides the high energy portion of the flight
profile. The PLV Descent Stage consists of an unmodified advanced liquid axial

09:14.780 --> 09:25.140
stage, or ALAS, a lightweight, low-cost liquid propulsion system. The PLV
landing stage is comprised of a modified lightweight exo-atmospheric projectile,

09:25.260 --> 09:34.760
or LEAP, and a payload system for deployment of specific planetary surface
exploration instruments. The LEAP is a flight-qualified, fully integrated

09:34.760 --> 09:46.100
autonomous spacecraft having been demonstrated on several DoD KKV space test
missions. The LEAP is a derivative of the AHIT hover test vehicle. The landing

09:46.100 --> 09:55.100
stage payload system consists of four similar payload modules, each of which
contains a separate surface instrument or device. The designated scientific

09:55.100 --> 10:03.600
instrument for the Ulysses design reference mission is the autonomous Grendel
micro rover. The Grendel is an artificially intelligent six-legged walker

10:03.600 --> 10:14.240
derived from three generations of predecessor mini-robots. A flight-type Grendel
will weigh about 5 and a half pounds. In its stowed configuration, it is

10:14.240 --> 10:23.340
slightly larger than a soft drink can. The behavior control software enables the
Grendel to operate autonomously for extended periods performing a variety of

10:23.340 --> 10:32.380
functions in response to its surroundings, scientific objectives, health status,
and other mission requirements. This adaptable micro-rover can be equipped with

10:32.380 --> 10:41.840
a variety of exploration devices, including recently developed superhuman micro
sensors. For transport and landing, the Grendel is housed in a landing capsule,

10:42.120 --> 10:53.080
or cocoon. This cocoon absorbs the landing impact and enables deployment of the
micro rovers onto almost any surface conditions. The Ulysses mission begins just

10:53.080 --> 11:02.900
as Apollo, from a low Earth orbit transition to lunar orbit. However, because a
pre-return trajectory is not necessary, an optimum performance or minimum energy

11:02.900 --> 11:12.520
five-day transfer is utilized. The Titan II launch vehicle was selected after a
series of trade-offs as a balance among cost, launch capability, and overall

11:12.520 --> 11:22.060
mission performance margins to maximize the probability of success. Again, just
as Apollo, lunar orbit insertion is performed by the Command Service Module

11:22.060 --> 11:31.760
equivalent lunar service vehicle, a contemporary small satellite. At specified
points in lunar orbit and depending on selected landing sites, each of the two

11:31.760 --> 11:40.520
PLVs performs an Apollo-type descent and landing. A lunar service vehicle
remains active in lunar orbit, functioning primarily as a data storage and

11:40.520 --> 11:48.660
communications relay between the surface stations and the Earth. Landing sites
on both the near side and the far side of the moon and located at any latitude

11:48.660 --> 11:56.860
can be addressed on a single Ulysses-type mission. It should be noted that the
Ulysses flight system and flight profile can be applied to almost any planetary

11:56.860 --> 12:07.120
body, including Mars, Saturn's moon Titan, and asteroids. As previously
illustrated, the PLV approach and landing follows almost exactly the fight

12:07.120 --> 12:15.680
profile demonstrated on each of the six Apollo landings. The ALAS descent stage
performs the higher energy braking phase, which is terminated at the low gate

12:15.680 --> 12:26.040
step, approximately 200 meters, or about 660 feet above the lunar surface. At
this low gate step, the ALAS is separated to continue downrange for disposal,

12:26.040 --> 12:34.460
and the leap landing stage is ignited to proceed in a near vertical descent to a
hover position above the landing point. Again, it should be noted that the

12:34.460 --> 12:42.200
amount of propulsion energy required for the alas descent stage for the braking
phase of an Apollo-type descent profile is almost identical to the propulsion

12:42.200 --> 12:51.900
energy required for a KKV intercept trajectory. Similarly, the amount of
propulsion energy required for the leap landing stage from low gate to touchdown

12:51.900 --> 13:01.900
is almost identical to that required during the tracking and intercept phase of
a KKV flight profile. This conveniently facilitates the conversion of DOD

13:01.900 --> 13:11.820
-developed KKV configuration to a planetary landing configuration that is ideal
for many types of planetary exploration missions. As the leap landing stage

13:11.820 --> 13:20.500
approaches the surface, it enters a precisely controlled vertical descent to the
landing point. After touchdown, each of the four payload modules ejects its

13:20.500 --> 13:31.440
cocoon onto the surface. After the cocoon opens, Grendel walks away to commence
its exploration activities. This final phase of leap landing and micro rover

13:31.440 --> 13:42.140
deployment was demonstrated during the Advanced Concept Architecture Test, or
ACAT, at Phillips Laboratory on September 1, 1993. The flight demonstration of

13:42.140 --> 13:49.840
the modified AHIT test vehicle included a translation maneuver to a hover
position directly above the landing point and a controlled descent to landing.

13:50.780 --> 14:00.700
The AHIT vehicle included a single prototype cocoon and Grendel. The following
is a real-time ACAT flight video that was extracted from official video data

14:00.700 --> 14:10.820
