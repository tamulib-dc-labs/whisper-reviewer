WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.660
They know what they're doing. Actually easy for us to say with the lower
gravity, it's a lot easier to roll. Now you tell me. Yes, and so I was more

00:10.660 --> 00:24.120
worried than I led on to Director Lunney at the time. Jerry expressed it pretty
well. By then, our major problems were bent fenders. By the time we flew Apollo

00:24.120 --> 00:39.720
17, we learned how to do it, and isn't that always just the way? Let's see. And
we have been talking for over two hours. You're amazingly patient. We've gone up

00:39.720 --> 00:49.820
and in many ways touched on not only the first missions but the last. I suggest
a couple of three more questions, and then I'm sure that our panelists would be

00:49.820 --> 01:01.160
happy to stay around and visit individually with a few of you that have one or
two questions left. Let's see. Somebody who's not asked in the front. I would

01:01.160 --> 01:11.060
just like you to take a moment and look into the future with all this great
anniversary that we're celebrating today. What in your all-in opinion is coming

01:12.000 --> 01:13.180
in the next 10 years?

01:18.300 --> 01:26.220
That might be a good question to end on. Do you want to address it right now? Do
you want to take one or two others and then we'll come back for a prediction of

01:26.220 --> 01:35.280
the future? Good question. Why don't we take a couple of others and then we'll
answer that. The panel will answer that. Yes. Yes.

01:55.760 --> 02:03.180
Was there any feeling on the part of the flight controllers that procedures

02:03.180 --> 02:14.140
left undone that would be very important to do as we went to Apollo 16 and 17,
knowing that those were the last ones? I'll take a crack at that one. I can't

02:14.140 --> 02:27.220
think of anything. And I know, and I was with it right till the very last, but,
and I hope this comes out right. I think, by and large, most of us were

02:27.220 --> 02:35.900
realistic enough to know the Apollo program couldn't go on forever. We had
pretty much done what we had set out to do, and besides that, there were guys

02:35.900 --> 02:45.600
that were already looking at this winged vehicle called Shuttle that would be
reusable, and by the time we flew 17, the first vote in the Congress that had

02:45.600 --> 02:55.340
already happened, in fact, it happened on 16, where we got the initial funding
for the shuttle. And I think there was at least, and I'm trying to put it in my

02:55.340 --> 03:04.020
own context in what other people had to say, I think we were ready to move on
psychologically. We would have flown more if they'd lined them up. We'd have

03:04.020 --> 03:15.760
continued to do it. But I think we were ready to go on to the next step. And I
think by the time we got to 17, there wasn't much new that we could do. with the

03:15.760 --> 03:25.860
hardware and the capability that we had with Apollo. And I can't recall anything
that was kind of left undone. And I really was, I know in my own case, I was

03:25.860 --> 03:34.880
ready to get out of the control center environment for a while to go do
something else. And that was in December of 1972 and I didn't realize it. But in

03:34.880 --> 03:41.520
April, I was in Washington. So I didn't intend to go quite that far that fast,
but Mr. Kraft took me at my words.

03:45.260 --> 03:45.780
OK.

03:49.140 --> 03:55.460
One other question before the last one. OK. Right in the middle.

04:10.440 --> 04:24.200
The question is, has there been any thought of recording the knowledge that's
come from the flight controllers and their co-workers with regard to Apollo and

04:24.200 --> 04:33.520
others as we prepare hopefully to head out to Mars. And I don't want to hog this
thing, but I'll take a minute to have a touch. You know, everything we've done

04:33.520 --> 04:44.600
in this country, major achievements, technological achievements, we've always
stood on the shoulders of those that went before us. You think of the airplane

04:44.600 --> 04:57.100
world, and you think of the space world. Guys like Dr. Goddard got us started
with rockets and von Braun and Chris Kraft and others, we're still standing on

04:57.100 --> 05:10.360
those people's shoulders today. I think people like us up here have a
responsibility like they did to participate in a proper kind of way as

05:10.360 --> 05:20.080
technology goes on. And heck, here's the case, we've got this guy still working
for NASA and one over there still working for a major contractor for NASA, still

05:20.080 --> 05:34.180
involved. Cliff and I have gone on to private sector duties and Joe Allen over
there is making all this money in the commercial space world. No, Sorry.

05:37.360 --> 05:51.940
Anyhow, I think that you will see and without getting too profound here or too
philosophical, I think today we have a better capability to call on people and

05:51.940 --> 06:02.080
their talent when we need it than maybe we did even back several years ago. And
I think it will be used. I would say, though, right on the heels of that, and it

06:02.080 --> 06:16.320
goes back to something I said in my opening remarks, I think it's very, very
important to excite the younger people, the youth, like we did in the 60s. and I

06:16.320 --> 06:27.040
look at these kids, I know my kid was here earlier, I know Glenn's son is in
here, he's so much smarter than we were at the same point that I don't think we

06:27.040 --> 06:35.580
have anything to worry about in terms of finding talent in this country to go to
Mars or wherever we want to go and I feel very good about it, just turn them

06:35.580 --> 06:46.780
loose and let them do it, that's the point Good Jerry, let me ask you to repeat
your question about Oh.

07:13.520 --> 07:23.700
Does the funding wanna be there for 20 years? The question is, where's the space
program going and the opinion of the panel, and on what schedule, what can we

07:23.700 --> 07:33.760
look forward to? And Steve, let's start with you at that end. Unfair because
these other fellows are more qualified now. I'm gonna touch just a piece of it

07:33.760 --> 07:43.920
because I think the rest of the panel may have a broader perspective. Clearly we
have a space station in work and clearly we're working very hard to that. I

07:43.920 --> 07:54.320
would like to come back, for my part, to the question that was previously asked,
and that is how are we going to do it? I am struck by how little I knew of what

07:54.320 --> 08:01.880
the major issues were in the Apollo program. When I got here, all I worried
about was how I was going to design my next display and do my next procedure.

08:01.980 --> 08:08.840
And there were some very fundamental things going on. There were some very
brilliant men, and we've mentioned some, and another man was Dr. Miller, who

08:08.840 --> 08:18.640
probably allowed us to go to the moon by 1970. The thing I see now is young
people come in and they are not just satisfied to do displays and procedures.

08:18.880 --> 08:28.500
They also want to learn how this program is being put together and how the
management of it will be conducted 20 years from now. And that tells me that

08:28.500 --> 08:35.640
whatever we choose to do, we're going to be able to do it. I didn't do that and
I think I'm depurred for it. They are doing it and I think they're the richer

08:35.640 --> 08:44.260
for it and I think a lot of the people in the audience are here to learn that
sort of thing. As far as the future, clearly, if I look back 20 years and say

08:44.260 --> 08:53.260
have we as far as I thought we'd be in 20 years, the answer is no. And why,
gosh, you could talk about that, from here to eternity, I would just hope that,

08:53.700 --> 09:00.680
as a minimum, in the next 10 years, we keep on the steps we've laid out for
ourselves, which is the next logical step of Space Station and then exploiting

09:00.680 --> 09:11.900
that. You know, I think, picking up on what Steve just said, there I think part
of this is brought about by the tremendous difference in communication that we

09:11.900 --> 09:22.980
have today, that we didn't have 20 years ago. In our higher education system, I
think is better, and there's a lot of reasons why these younger people think the

09:22.980 --> 09:33.100
way they do. But one is, they're better in excuse me, they're better informed.
They have been since they were this tall. That's good news, I think, for the

09:33.100 --> 09:43.680
space program, because I think the young people in the country that have grown
up with it and they're coming into young adulthood now are better informed. And

09:43.680 --> 09:56.400
I think they may demand more. I hope they do. And I hope that they will be able
to do something we haven't been able to do in the last 20 years and that's bring

09:56.400 --> 10:08.860
what I'd call a renewed or a recurring excitement to the space effort. Now, that
kind of sounds like a downer. I believe over the last 20 years though, we have,

10:09.080 --> 10:20.380
if you look at the shuttle, a tremendous accomplishment. We have been able to
bring it online and, yes, we had a very tragic halt in that program similar to

10:20.380 --> 10:29.740
what we had in Apollo, and had a tougher time, get it going again. But it is
going again now. So we've got to continue the shuttle program's successful

10:29.740 --> 10:36.440
operation over the next several years. and I don't think there's any doubt that
that will happen. I think the Congress is behind that. I think the

10:36.440 --> 10:48.320
administration and the agency are all in sync. Space Station, having some fits
and starts getting started. And I think the reason, although it's approved and

10:48.320 --> 10:58.260
although it's ongoing, is that it did not have the strong backing of the
administration and the Congress locked arm to arm to make it happen. It survived

10:58.260 --> 11:08.300
kind of barely and got started. And it's a program that has had to battle
extremely hard at a time when the country is undergoing tremendous financial

11:08.300 --> 11:22.000
deficits and competing arrangements. I think we need to do a better job in that
regard, incidentally. And this is not easy, but we got to do a better job. And

11:22.000 --> 11:31.460
there is a sign that it's happening of communicating with the American people
what the space program is all about. And I don't mean in a technocrat kind of

11:31.460 --> 11:45.400
way, I'm talking about shaking up their emotions. And we're seeing a little of
that around this Apollo 11 celebration. But then it quickly tends to die out. If

11:45.400 --> 11:56.520
there's a message that I would say to go on now to back to the moon and
establish a base or on to Mars or wherever. We've got to learn that in the space

11:56.520 --> 12:05.140
program where the federal dollar is going to support most of it, there will be
commercial growth as well, but most of it in the near term is going to be

12:05.140 --> 12:15.040
federal dollars. We've got to get down in the trenches and play the way the rest
of the country plays that game. We've always been the fair-haired boys and the

12:15.040 --> 12:24.120
fair-haired girls on the block. People love NASA. They thought it was doing the
right kind of thing, and we just almost didn't have to work real hard at it. Now

12:24.120 --> 12:34.760
that's an overstatement, to make a point, but we've got to get down now and play
this game politically, just like everybody else has played for, and they've got

12:34.760 --> 12:45.020
some of them 200 years of experience on us, and there's signs that that's
happening, with congressional clout applied in a way that members of Congress

12:45.020 --> 12:55.500
can understand, which is generally with political action committees and other
kinds of straight talk. And I believe that the American people, man on the

12:55.500 --> 13:04.680
street and woman on the street, clearly support what we do in space and would
support more. But they're going to have to have the politicians, and I'm talking

13:04.680 --> 13:17.020
about the elected officials and the appointed officials in the executive branch
and the members of Congress get that message. I think we will go on in the next

13:17.020 --> 13:26.480
20 years. So I think your 11-year-old son's got a great future. If he wants to
make it in space, we're not going to stop. It's not going to be easy and we're

13:26.480 --> 13:33.900
going to have some fits and starts and so forth. But I think by the time he's
ready to step into one of those consoles over there at Mission Control, he's

13:33.900 --> 13:37.400
going to have something to operate. It'll be a fun time.

13:40.740 --> 13:50.100
Cliff? Well, I don't know that I can add anything to what Jerry and Steven said.
I had the same question put to me 20 years ago, I think, about where you think

13:50.100 --> 14:02.000
we'll be in 20 years. And my answer was wrong, because we're not there. I would
have thought we would already have a space station in orbit. We did have some

14:02.000 --> 14:16.400
forgotten program called Skylab, which is unfortunate that we weren't able to
continue with that. I tend to agree with Jerry. I think that there will be a

14:16.400 --> 14:28.280
space program. I don't think the country can afford not to have a space program.
As far as a schedule, I think that's the rub. I think it's going to be very

14:28.280 --> 14:38.900
difficult to get anybody to commit to, yes, I want to do this by this time.
Because as soon as they do that, they sort of define the envelope how many

14:38.900 --> 14:52.880
dollars it's going to take to do it and we saw that in shuttle. For years we
used schedule as a reprogramming authority for money. We let schedule slip so we

14:52.880 --> 15:02.340
didn't have to spend the money. I see it being out of NASA these days. I see it
going on with the space station now. It looks to me like they headed down the

15:02.340 --> 15:15.940
same road. But I don't mean that to be discouraging. I And if you don't get to
go as fast as you want to go, and I'm sure you won't, you hardly ever do, keep

15:15.940 --> 15:25.680
plugging. Because I think that we're going to be there, and I think we're going
to put that space station up and have a human presence in space from the United

15:25.680 --> 15:26.140
States.

15:29.060 --> 15:42.380
Chair Greg Musilké – I speak to that subject as a space cadet. All of us up here
are space cadets. We believe in what we are doing. We believe it's important to

15:42.380 --> 15:52.180
our people in this country. And it's probably important, just as important to
everybody on earth. I believe the things that we will do in the future, the

15:52.180 --> 16:02.020
missions, the kind of purposes that we will have will kind of revolve around
sort of two thoughts. One is, we ought to learn how to exploit the space

16:02.020 --> 16:10.700
capabilities we have We have to do everything possible to return a direct
benefit to our people here on earth as soon as we possibly can. By that I mean,

16:11.120 --> 16:21.220
although it's struggling, I believe in the kind of idea that Joe Allen's company
here represents. That is that there is a way to provide a commercial space

16:21.220 --> 16:30.080
platform for the manufacturing of materials in space. That's what I mean by
exploitation. That, communications, weather, understanding what's going on in

16:30.080 --> 16:39.420
our planet, contributing to whatever we could do from space to understanding
global pollution and solutions perhaps there too. I think that is something that

16:39.420 --> 16:51.200
we can contribute to and we ought to in some substantive way. I believe also
that there will always be an exploration component element of our space cadet

16:51.200 --> 17:02.320
outlook and our space program. By that I mean we will build a space station. We
will use it as a jumping off base to go back to the moon. someday on some

17:02.320 --> 17:12.180
schedule. We'll also use the moon to jump off from and go on to someplace else.
Perhaps we'll go to Mars from the moon for all I know, but that, those two

17:12.180 --> 17:21.680
components of the space program will now continue. If you were to ask anybody up
here or ask almost anybody where the space program will be in 100 years, I mean

17:21.680 --> 17:36.900
they, the mind tends to conjure up Star Trek kind of images about what we could,
do in 100 years compared to where we are today wasn't much more than 100 years

17:36.900 --> 17:44.520
ago people came here and covered wagons. Look what we're doing today. So if you
just extrapolate that and say what could we do in 100 years, we could be doing

17:44.520 --> 17:55.260
some pretty vast and important things and for all I know have a lot of people,
very very many people in the population working and operating in space. I think

17:55.260 --> 18:03.480
that will happen on some schedule, but I don't know what it is. but I think the
space program, as it moves forward today, will be exploiting what we're able to

18:03.480 --> 18:13.040
do for direct benefit to Earth, and retaining and building on the exploration
component, which I think is an important part of the inspiration that the space

18:13.040 --> 18:22.800
program offers. So for those of you who have to run it, the question was asked
before about corporate knowledge, you should learn whatever you can from the

18:22.800 --> 18:31.340
experiences of the past and the history and those people who participated in
those things, and you ought to learn what you can for them. But my advice is to

18:31.340 --> 18:42.240
take charge of it. Get on with it. And don't wait for anybody to tell you. It's
your program as much as anybody's, so you take charge of it. Well, thank you.

18:42.300 --> 18:54.660
I'd like to thank the panel. You're a lot better disciplined than I had feared.
I did enjoy it. I appreciate it. and please join me in showing your

18:54.660 --> 18:57.340
appreciation. Applause

19:06.440 --> 19:08.080
Most of you are late for work.
