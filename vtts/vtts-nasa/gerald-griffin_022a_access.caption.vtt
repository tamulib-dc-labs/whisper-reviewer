00:01.760 --> 00:14.980
Space Story 1080. 4 minutes 30 seconds coming in 3, 2, 1. From NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center, a look at the orbital gymnastics of an old spacecraft.

00:18.100 --> 00:27.020
This is the Space Story, a weekly space and aeronautics report brought to you by
this station and NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

00:30.020 --> 00:40.160
In one of the most complex orbital maneuvers ever undertaken by a spacecraft,
NASA's International Sun-Earth Explorer, or IC3, moved in a series of looping

00:40.160 --> 00:48.320
trajectories going to three different targets in almost four years. Originally
launched to study the charged particles coming from the sun, IC was then

00:48.320 --> 00:57.340
rerouted to conduct an exploratory survey of the Earth's distant magnetic tail,
a region in space never explored before. The man behind IC's complex space

00:57.340 --> 01:05.500
navigation is Dr. Robert Farquhar from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. This
is really known as an acrobatic satellite because very seldom have we had one

01:05.500 --> 01:16.880
that we can move all over near space by using the gravity field of the moon to
bend the orbit and to send it out further and bring it in closer. You can do

01:16.880 --> 01:23.720
almost anything you want by using the gravity field of the moon and the
propulsive capability of the spacecraft. The spacecraft, which has been renamed

01:23.720 --> 01:32.420
International Cometary Explorer, is now on its way to intercept a comet called
Giacobini Zinner, It will be the first time a man-made object intercepts the

01:32.420 --> 01:45.400
comet. We passed within 120 kilometers of the surface of the moon, and the moon
acted like a slingshot and hurled the spacecraft out towards the comet. And we

01:45.400 --> 01:56.340
will reach the comet on September 11, 1985. This is about six months before all
the other spacecraft from the Soviet Union, from the European Space Agency, from

01:56.340 --> 02:05.740
the Japanese Space Agency, will be going through Halley's comet, so that in fact
the United States will be the first nation to send a spacecraft to a comet. We

02:05.740 --> 02:14.080
asked Dr. Farquhar if the dust coming out of Comet Jacobini-Zinner could in any
way impact the spacecraft. We do have to worry about that going through Jacobini

02:14.080 --> 02:23.680
-Zinner, though it also has a dust problem, and dust will be impacting the
spacecraft at about 20 km per second and could do a lot of damage before we get

02:23.680 --> 02:32.660
all of our measurements. Our present models show that this should not be a
problem, but one never knows because nobody has ever been to a comet before Some

02:32.660 --> 02:41.700
of the things that could happen is that a dust particle could penetrate the
spacecraft and destroy our communications system, or some other critical

02:41.700 --> 02:51.780
instrument on the spacecraft Well, I think we already got our money's worth from
this mission because we already done two missions prior to the comet mission And

02:51.780 --> 02:59.580
so, I think we already got the value out of the spacecraft But the other thing
is, even if it's destroyed as it passes through the comet, we expect to get data

02:59.580 --> 03:07.560
about halfway through anyway, and that's still going to be very valuable. If all
goes as planned, the spacecraft will be in the area of the solar wind between

03:07.560 --> 03:16.680
Halley's comet and the sun in early 1986. Intercepting Giacobini-Zinner and
studying comet Halley will allow scientists to make comparative studies between

03:16.680 --> 03:25.120
the two. Comets are believed to be among the most primitive bodies in space.
Scientists believe they can trace the International Cometary Explorer for many

03:25.120 --> 03:36.160
years after its cometary encounter. One of the novelties of the orbit that we're
in going out to the comet is that the orbital period is kind of synchronized

03:36.160 --> 03:45.900
with the Earth's orbital period. And 30 years after we had left the Earth, which
is 1983, we'll be coming back close to the Earth again. This is the year 2013.

03:46.760 --> 03:56.240
And at that time, we planned on using the moon's gravity once again to recapture
the spacecraft and put it into an Earth orbit, and then probably transfer it

03:56.240 --> 04:04.940
into a lunar transfer orbit where the spacecraft could be picked up by an
advanced shuttle spacecraft. And people can look at it in the Air and Space

04:04.940 --> 04:14.320
Museum. It cost less than $5 million dollars to reuse this old spacecraft while
it would've required two additional spacecraft at an approximate cost of $100

04:14.320 --> 04:17.020
million each to perform the same job.

04:19.760 --> 04:28.700
This has been The Space Story, a weekly space and aeronautics report brought to
you by this station and NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

04:43.720 --> 04:56.960
space story 1081 four minutes thirty seconds coming in 3 two one one of the
areas that stand to benefit most from spaceflight is the ability to make

04:56.960 --> 05:05.460
scientific observations of the Earth from space on the next space shuttle
mission scheduled for October the orbiter will become an earth observatory and

05:05.460 --> 05:12.660
the astronauts will be gathering geologic geographic and oceanographic
information about our planet. One of the crew members on this mission is

05:12.660 --> 05:21.260
astronaut Kathy Sullivan. Starting off on the very first day of the flight we're
going to launch an earth radiation budget satellite that we call ERBS. It's a

05:21.260 --> 05:29.720
NASA project that has a variety of scientific instruments aboard that are
designed to look at the radiation balance of the earth and hopefully provide

05:29.720 --> 05:38.440
some information in concert with other weather satellites that will help us get
a better understanding of what drives the world's climates. We have also another

05:38.440 --> 05:48.340
set of science experiments that includes a side-looking radar and an imaging
experiment to identify features on the ground and an atmospheric pollution

05:48.340 --> 05:57.320
experiment. I've been the lead crew member on that group of experiments called
OST-3. And all the way in the back of the cargo bay on another rack we'll have a

05:57.320 --> 06:05.420
large format camera that will take very high resolution pictures of the Earth's
surface on 9 inch by 18 inch frames of film. One of the most interesting

06:05.420 --> 06:14.120
experiments on board is the shuttle imaging radar. First flown in the second
space shuttle mission, the improved larger radar antenna will obtain data in

06:14.120 --> 06:23.220
digital form so it can be run through computers and bring out more subtle
detail. About 115 investigators throughout the world are studying the data we

06:23.220 --> 06:32.080
will get back with the radar. When we flew an imaging radar on the second
shuttle flight, we called it SUR-A, we learned a lot about how stable and how

06:32.080 --> 06:41.780
suitable the orbiter is as a platform for an imaging radar. Probably the most
startling thing that was discovered on the terrain that Sur A looked at was in

06:41.780 --> 06:51.160
the southern portions of Egypt and the eastern areas of Libya. And it was
discovered there in some of the great sand seas of the northeastern Sahara that

06:51.160 --> 07:01.200
the couple of top meters of sand, six to ten feet or so, were so extremely dry
and porous that the radar beams actually could penetrate that layer and would

07:01.200 --> 07:10.700
then reflect off of a surface beneath the sand sheet. So what would look to your
eye as a just trackless sand sheet if you flew over or were driving across it,

07:10.860 --> 07:21.280
to the radar's eye, it turned out to be an old, about 60,000-year-old river
system complete with valleys and channels and gravels and sandbars that had just

07:21.280 --> 07:32.060
accidentally almost been covered by a sheet of dune sand. This has turned out to
tell everybody quite a lot about the earlier climate and the earlier water flow

07:32.060 --> 07:40.300
patterns in that region. And archaeologically, it's also turned up a lot of
interesting detail about former civilizations in that part of Africa. Some of

07:40.300 --> 07:48.480
the very dry areas of Egypt that we looked at with Sur A are again candidates to
be looked at with Sur B and see what more detail we might discover with the

07:48.480 --> 07:59.000
better equipment. And since we really had never understood before Sur-A that
that kind of mapping through the surface was possible, we've looked very

07:59.000 --> 08:06.840
carefully on the Sur-B sites for other areas of the world that might be that dry
and might have a transparent surface layer beneath which we could see evidence

08:06.840 --> 08:14.740
of former rivers or perhaps learn more things about old climates and older
civilizations. On this mission, Kathy Sullivan will become the first woman to

08:14.740 --> 08:22.980
conduct an extravehicular activity, or spacewalk, Together with crew member Dave
Leestma, she will be demonstrating the capability of refueling satellites in

08:22.980 --> 08:32.280
space. We asked her what this mission means to her personally. The idea of my
being an astronaut came along as I was finishing graduate school and recognized

08:32.280 --> 08:41.840
that the kind of expeditionary research that I had enjoyed very much doing at
sea and on land as a geologist was also being done in space, and with the advent

08:41.840 --> 08:51.420
of the shuttle, there was even a niche, a role in space, for someone with the
kind of broad scientific and technical background that I had. I can't fully

08:51.420 --> 08:57.660
appreciate sitting here on the ground how amazing and beautiful I expect the
Earth to be from that perspective.

09:00.380 --> 09:09.280
This has been The Space Story, a weekly space and aeronautics report brought to
you by this station and NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

09:30.160 --> 09:45.960
Space Story 1082 4 minutes 30 seconds coming in 3 2 1 This is the Space Story a
weekly space and aeronautics report brought to you by this station and NASA the

09:45.960 --> 09:48.060
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

09:51.120 --> 10:00.100
For many years, astronomers learned about the universe by looking at it in the
narrow part of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light. Later they

10:00.100 --> 10:09.900
discovered that stars send out kinds of energy that we cannot see, such as
infrared and ultraviolet radiation, radio waves, x-rays, and gamma rays. Each

10:09.900 --> 10:17.700
part of the spectrum has its own contributions to make to our understanding of
the universe. The Gamma Ray Observatory, scheduled to be launched by the Space

10:17.700 --> 10:27.920
Shuttle in 1988, will be a powerful tool for understanding some of the most
fascinating objects in space. Pulsars, quasars, active galaxies, and black

10:27.920 --> 10:37.680
holes. Dr. Donald Kniffen is Project Scientist for the Gamma Ray Observatory at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Whenever one of these violent events takes

10:37.680 --> 10:51.280
place in the universe, a supernova explosion or a black hole or a pulsar, lots
of very, very energetic processes take place. And because gamma rays are such

10:51.280 --> 11:02.580
high energy, that means in these processes, in these interactions which occur,
then a lot of energy is available to go into things like gamma rays. Now, the

11:02.580 --> 11:13.780
way that we learn about any object, viewing it through astronomy, You have to
deduce what's going on in the vicinity of the place where the gamma rays are

11:13.780 --> 11:24.560
being produced by the things that you can see. Gamma rays, like any other
photon, travel directly from the source to us so we can make a good guess as to

11:24.560 --> 11:34.020
what object they're coming from. But what we want to learn about by observing
the gamma rays is what mechanism is occurring. This then tells us about the

11:34.020 --> 11:43.880
physics that's going on in the source and hence what sort of types of violent
reactions are taking place. And from this then we can learn about things like

11:43.880 --> 11:56.480
the evolution of our universe. We can learn about the actual details of the
supernova process where very heavy elements are believed to be formed. Dr. David

11:56.480 --> 12:03.740
Thompson, also from the Goddard Space Flight Center, explain some of the
contributions the Gamma Ray Observatory can make. The observatory will help us

12:03.740 --> 12:16.360
understand pulsars. Pulsars were first discovered by radio astronomers, and it
is now thought that a pulsar is a rapidly rotating remnant of a star that once

12:16.360 --> 12:27.820
lived. When that star died in a supernova explosion, it left behind a tiny core
of material, extremely dense material. If you had a sugar cube made out of

12:27.820 --> 12:37.800
neutron star material, it would weigh about 300 million tons on the surface of
the Earth, a sugar cube. So this is what a neutron star is like. These neutron

12:37.800 --> 12:49.780
stars are spinning. And as they spin, they put out pulses of radio emission. And
some of these are now known to put out pulses of gamma ray emission. Those that

12:49.780 --> 13:02.820
we have studied indicate that even though there are lots more radio waves seen
from these, most of the energy that we see coming out of a pulsar is actually in

13:02.820 --> 13:14.260
the form of gamma rays. And that means that by studying the gamma rays, we learn
something about what it's like around a neutron star, a place that's so exotic

13:14.260 --> 13:22.960
and foreign that we can't even picture it on Earth. Quasars also emit tremendous
amounts of energy in the form of gamma rays. Quasars have always been considered

13:22.960 --> 13:31.180
exotic because they appear to be moving away from us at a large fraction of the
speed of light, which may indicate that they are somewhere and they are very

13:31.180 --> 13:39.120
distant parts of the universe. And yet the fact that we can see them indicates
that they are radiating tremendous amounts of energy and may indeed be powered

13:39.120 --> 13:48.280
by black holes. If you want to see what's going on near a black hole, you have
to get out something that involves a large amount of energy, and that's a gamma

13:48.280 --> 13:48.540
ray.

13:51.440 --> 14:00.060
This has been the Space Story, a weekly space and aeronautics report brought to
you by this station and NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

14:16.740 --> 14:30.880
Space Story 1,083. 4 minutes 30 seconds. Coming in three, two, one. This is the
Space Story. A weekly space and aeronautics report brought to you by this

14:30.880 --> 14:34.660
station and NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

14:38.080 --> 14:47.620
Recent events, such as the 1982 and 83 disastrous El Nino current, which caused
billions of dollars in damage and considerable loss of life, have demonstrated

14:47.620 --> 14:55.780
the need to better understand the workings of the ocean and its effects on our
climate. In the past, satellites have been the key to global measurements of the

14:55.780 --> 15:05.840
ocean. One of the instruments on NASA's 1979 CSAT satellite made as many
individual measurements of wind speed and direction as were collected during the

15:05.840 --> 15:15.980
previous century of shipboard observations. NASA has invited an oceanographer to
fly on the next space shuttle mission. Australian-born Paul Scully Power will be

15:15.980 --> 15:26.520
performing three major functions during this flight. The first is to test the
hypothesis, if you will, that a trained oceanographer up there can see more than

15:26.520 --> 15:38.740
an astronaut who's highly trained but not in that particular field. And the
second thing is going to be that in recent flights, the astronauts have made

15:38.740 --> 15:46.520
some significant new discoveries in oceanography from their flights. For
example, they have discovered a new type of ocean eddy which has a spiral

15:46.520 --> 15:54.380
structure, most of the ocean eddies that you find in the scientific literature
all sort of, the currents are circular. In these new type of eddies were found

15:54.380 --> 16:02.560
the currents are in fact spiral. And so there's a recent discovery made by the
astronaut crews. And so my second objective is to go look at these new

16:02.560 --> 16:10.800
discoveries that they've seen and try and interpret that. And the third major
objective is that on this particular flight, it's an Earth Sciences Mission, and

16:10.800 --> 16:18.260
specifically they're going to have a synthetic aperture radar looking at the
solid Earth and on the oceans. And so I will probably be taking photographs

16:19.320 --> 16:29.960
simultaneously with the radar of the ocean sites that the radar is capturing on
the radar imaging system. I will be in fact capturing those same sites in colour

16:29.960 --> 16:38.240
photography. Both world weather and long term climate changes are strongly
linked to ocean behaviour. The weather we've had in the last 18 months has been

16:38.240 --> 16:51.500
tied now directly to the North Pacific in terms of anomalous temperature, so
it's very obvious and there's a time lag too. The weather patterns that we've

16:51.500 --> 16:59.740
seen have been triggered by temperature anomalies in the ocean which occurred
six months previously to that. so there's a time lag. So obviously, if you're

16:59.740 --> 17:08.000
going to be able to do long-term weather prediction you've got to understand the
ocean. And that really makes a lot of sense, and I think everyone's in general

17:08.000 --> 17:15.780
agreement with that because if you think of the ocean as a sort of big heat
reservoir, it's like a big heat engine that drives the atmosphere. So what

17:15.780 --> 17:23.800
happens in the atmosphere is in fact driven by the ocean, and not the other way
around. Okay, so therefore oceanography is important. Then in the last two or

17:23.800 --> 17:30.920
three years there's been some theoretical work in oceanography that says if
you're ever going to understand the ocean dynamics you have to focus on what is

17:30.920 --> 17:42.700
called the Mese scale, what that translates to is mid scale and that really is
you know events that have size, if you will, of tens to hundreds of miles, okay.

17:43.580 --> 17:50.820
For example ocean eddies, and the more we learn about oceanography the more
we're finding that there's more and more eddies in the ocean. They have

17:50.820 --> 18:02.140
diameters of anywhere say between 70 and 150 miles. So it's right in that mid
scale. Now it turns out that from low earth orbit on the shuttle the natural

18:02.140 --> 18:12.840
field of view of the human eye or camera system is that scale. So obviously the
correct vantage point to see the whole pattern at that scale is from low earth

18:12.840 --> 18:21.840
orbit. And so that's one of the rationales as to why I'm due to fly on the
shuttle to take advantage of that particular viewing mode. And so you see the

18:21.840 --> 18:31.200
connectivity then from what I'm seeing to the mid-sized patterns in the ocean
which drives the total ocean dynamics, which drives the atmosphere. And so we

18:31.200 --> 18:34.280
can predict the long-term weather prediction. So it really is all tied together.

18:37.420 --> 18:46.300
This has been the Space Story, a weekly space and aeronautics report brought to
you by this station and NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
