00:01.200 --> 00:07.720
Who has the voice levels? He's the one you talked to before. Oh, okay. Why don't
you tell us about the weather out there while he catches your voice? Well, it's

00:07.720 --> 00:19.340
cold as hell here. It's what? It's cold as hell here, if you don't mind that
phrase. It's cold for me. I'm coming out here from California, and it's 20

00:19.340 --> 00:30.040
-degree weather out here. And I'm used to 50s or 60s at this time of year. So
I've been here two or three days, another part of Philadelphia. i got up this

00:30.040 --> 00:43.180
morning it was 22 23 degrees yeah that was a little cold yeah i'm from
california myself so i go ahead yeah okay listen yeah the tape's rolling now um

00:43.180 --> 00:49.940
listen the first question you know i intend to be specific like you suggested
but the first question i just wanted to to have you say a little bit about the

00:49.940 --> 01:00.060
origin or genesis of underwood miller you know how you got together and started
it? Yeah, I'd be glad to, because it's kind of an unusual story, as far as

01:00.060 --> 01:09.040
business partnerships are concerned. In 1975, I

01:09.040 --> 01:20.440
decided I wanted to publish a book. Specifically I wanted to publish The Dying
Earth in a hardcover form. I was a used book dealer, and Chuck Miller was a used

01:20.440 --> 01:31.520
book dealer dealing in rare and out-of-print books and some new material and we
knew of each other and I think we had bought and sold books from each other from

01:31.520 --> 01:44.920
time to time and Chuck heard about I may have mentioned in a letter about The
Dying Earth and Chuck offered his expertise because he knew a good deal about

01:44.920 --> 01:57.500
certain parts of publishing industry about distribution and that end of it. And
my experience, my limited experience, had to do with just graphically putting a

01:57.500 --> 02:09.640
book together. And so he suggested that we do the book together. And so we did.
And the interesting thing is that we never met each other until the book had

02:09.640 --> 02:22.560
already been published. And that was a year later in 1976. six and up to that
time we were literally exchanging thousands of dollars to the mail and doing

02:22.560 --> 02:33.700
business without without ever having met each other we were in a sense complete
strangers but we had this one connection and that is we both felt strongly about

02:33.700 --> 02:44.140
this one work of vance of the dying earth and about vance's work in general and
about specifically about fantasy and science fiction and horror and literature.

02:44.940 --> 02:56.420
And we had that association. And the fact is that that literary genre, fantasy
and science fiction, most of the people in it seem to be honest, or at least

02:56.420 --> 03:06.860
most of the people dealing in it professionally as book dealers and book buyers.
And so it worked out well. A year later we met in Kansas City at a convention

03:07.920 --> 03:17.560
selling the Dying Earth and selling some other books. and since then, we've gone
on and have published, I think it's up to 43 books now, I haven't counted.

03:18.260 --> 03:25.400
Mostly Vance, but some other authors also, Zelazny and Williamson

03:25.400 --> 03:42.380
and Robert E. Howard and Stephen R. Donaldson and a few others. so that's that's
the general background I met Vance in the course of publishing the dying earth I

03:43.360 --> 03:54.940
wrote him a letter and he wrote back and he's uh in the same general vicinity
and hours drive from my house and he wrote back and said come over and I did and

03:54.940 --> 04:06.280
we struck up quite a friendship and A few years later, Jack attended a
convention out east and met Chuck, and the three of us spent some time together.

04:07.100 --> 04:18.940
More as friends than anything else. Our association has been through the book,
through publishing Jack's books, but our relationship has really not been one of

04:18.940 --> 04:31.340
business at all. We have business maybe twice a year when we pay royalties to
them or we send them a contract, but it's a very casually done and doesn't

04:31.340 --> 04:33.040
really figure too much in the relationship.

04:38.000 --> 04:46.640
I'd say that's the background. Yeah, that's fine. That's excellent. As long as
you brought up Jack Vance already, why did you think Dying Earth was special?

04:46.760 --> 04:58.540
What was the impetus there for wanting to publish that one? Well, at that time,
and in fact it's even more true today, A lot of science fiction and fantasy, and

04:58.540 --> 05:11.640
sometimes the best of it, does not get published in hardcover editions. And what
Chuck and I do is we publish high-quality hardcover books for collectors in

05:11.640 --> 05:23.740
limited editions and for libraries on acid-free paper and with library binding
like that. And we publish small editions. And our editions are too small,

05:23.740 --> 05:40.480
really, for a mainstream New York publisher like Harper & Row or Doubleday to
bother with. They have to publish 5,000 books in hardcover just to break even

05:40.480 --> 05:49.440
with their advertising and their overhead. We can publish an edition of a
thousand or fifteen hundred and do all right because we don't have a large

05:49.440 --> 06:01.000
overhead and our advertising consists of essentially specialty bookstores in our
mailing list. We also sell the libraries extensively, but that doesn't require

06:01.000 --> 06:14.420
much advertising. So we're filling a slot there. And The Dying Earth was the
first book we did. And it was just a book that is essentially a classic. It was

06:14.420 --> 06:26.640
published in 1950 as a paperback. And it had never been in hardcover. And it's
just one of the outstanding books in the fantasy field. And 200 years from now,

06:26.660 --> 06:35.820
people will be reading it. And it had never been in a durable hardcover edition.
And so we put it in one and sold it to collectors and sold it to libraries and

06:35.820 --> 06:46.920
did very well with it. Do you eventually intend to do all of Vance's work or
just selected items? I would say most of it, a good deal of it, simply because

06:46.920 --> 06:49.400
we have our association with Vance.

06:52.120 --> 07:09.240
And a number of our clients are Vance fans and collect Vance. And a lot of what
Vance has written is good. Vance, of course, is among a lot of other fantasy and

07:09.240 --> 07:15.080
science fiction writers, has written his share of forgettable

07:15.080 --> 07:24.620
fiction. But a lot of what he's written is really memorable and worth
preserving. And Vance, like other science fiction and fantasy writers like Fritz

07:24.620 --> 07:36.840
Leiber and Philip K. Dick and Ursula Le Guin and any number of people you could
name, had the bulk of their work published in paperback. And these books never

07:36.840 --> 07:51.240
saw a hardcover edition simply because of the economics of the time. so yeah we
are publishing other authors now but we will continue to publish Vance's work

07:51.240 --> 08:04.760
because we both enjoy reading it and we think it's significant literature in
other words part of your concern there is to make sure that work you think is

08:04.760 --> 08:11.460
significant is made permanent so it's available to readers that's it, just to
preserve the work that was the original That and just the pleasure of

08:11.460 --> 08:22.920
bookmaking, just the pleasure. Chuck and I both take a great pleasure in making
a good book, a book that has its signature sewn, which is something that doesn't

08:22.920 --> 08:32.640
occur in general trade hardcover publishing anymore, a book that's printed on
acid-free paper so that in 20 or 30 years the paper won't turn brittle and

08:32.640 --> 08:44.900
brown, and just a well-made, well-bound book, attractively made and artistically
put together. And publishing a book like that, creating a book like that is

08:44.900 --> 09:00.980
really a pleasure. And of course, your listeners may care to know that, or they
may not understand that a publisher is not a printer. A publisher,

09:01.340 --> 09:12.760
traditionally, has always just been the person who creates the book and
organizes the book as a package, as a book, not as a novel. The writer writes

09:12.760 --> 09:24.620
the fiction, and the publisher sees that it's manufactured, but as of today, no
major publisher owns any printing equipment. I think Doubleday was the last

09:24.620 --> 09:33.720
house that actually owned some printing equipment, and they no longer do, and
we're the same way. Our books are manufactured in Michigan, and I live in

09:33.720 --> 09:47.380
California, and Chuck Miller lives in Pennsylvania, and we do everything at a
distance. We design the books, and we decide as to what size they're going to be

09:47.380 --> 09:56.520
and who's going to illustrate them if they're illustrated. We make the editorial
choice of deciding what books to publish and when and how many copies to print,

09:56.520 --> 10:06.040
and those kind of decisions. And then the book is sent off to a printer, and the
book is printed and bound, and then shipped back to us. And so that is

10:06.040 --> 10:17.400
essentially what we do. And we do it, Chuck and I do it together, talking on the
phone once or twice a week, and through the mail. If I remember, some of your

10:17.400 --> 10:25.200
earlier books, in the back it said that they had been printed, I thought, or the
typography or the printing was somewhere in San Francisco. Now, what's that got

10:25.200 --> 10:35.880
to do with Michigan? I'm not sure. the the first book that we did was was
manufactured in san francisco and the second book that we did was manufactured

10:35.880 --> 10:52.340
in um in illinois in indiana the first book we did was manufactured in san
francisco the second book was by donnelly in indiana and then the third book and

10:52.340 --> 11:03.240
and all the books since then Save One, which was printed up in Vermont, but most
of them have been in mid-Michigan. There's a reason for that. We're doing what's

11:03.240 --> 11:17.160
called short print runs, which is 1,000, 1,500 copies. And there are printers in
the Michigan area who are set up to do that length of print run. They can do

11:17.160 --> 11:26.460
that length of print run very economically. For example, whoever is printing
Vikings books, and actually most of them are printed in Brattleboro, Vermont,

11:27.660 --> 11:38.500
that particular printer is set up to do from 5,000 to 100,000 books, and they
like to do 20,000 or 30,000 at minimum, and that's where they're economical.

11:39.020 --> 11:50.920
They can't do 1,000 books. To do 1,000 books there would cost a great deal of
money. By the same token, because of the size of their press and the size of

11:50.920 --> 12:06.740
their shop, the printer that we use in the mid-Michigan area in Ann Arbor is set
up to do from 500 to 1,500 books, and that's their niche. And just because of

12:06.740 --> 12:15.840
the size of the press and the size of the shop and a number of other factors, is
depending upon how many books you're printing and what kind of book and what

12:15.840 --> 12:24.940
quality of book you want printed, you have to shop around and find the best
place to do it. And it took us a year or two to really find our stride, to find

12:24.940 --> 12:35.520
the right printer who could print a very high-quality book in a limited edition
and yet at a reasonable price. And when we found one, we stuck with them. Good,

12:35.600 --> 12:47.440
okay. I understand better now. Say for a book by Vance, What's a normal run of a
cloth book like that? And how do you determine how many you're going to do? Why

12:47.440 --> 12:59.580
not more, if you can sell them? You're thinking of our print run now. Yeah. The
books we do. Right. Okay, we normally do... Well, Green Magic, for example, is 1

12:59.580 --> 13:13.460
,500 copies. Some of them are as few as 500 copies. We're primarily publishing
for collectors. When we have a book that's essentially a new collection, like

13:13.460 --> 13:27.020
Green Magic was, or it's a first hardcover edition, a book that's never been out
as such before, which Galactic Effectuator was, we might do a few more, but

13:27.020 --> 13:42.860
generally we stay around 1,000 copies or 1,500 copies. And there's a couple
reasons for that. One is we're selling to collectors, and the collectors are

13:42.860 --> 13:55.880
buying these books with the knowledge that they're going to go out of print and
become valuable later on. Another reason is that Chuck and I don't own a

13:55.880 --> 14:08.380
warehouse, and we are not in business to have a large inventory. We couldn't, we
would make more money if we printed more books. Because as you print more books,

14:08.520 --> 14:11.780
the cost per book of manufacturing goes down dramatically.

14:15.220 --> 14:24.980
But we just simply can't afford to have a lot of books in inventory sitting
around. We can't afford, our books go out of print in about nine months. And

14:24.980 --> 14:35.300
this is just the opposite of a major manufacturer like Dutton or Brown or
someone like that. They want their book to stay in print as long as possible.

14:35.640 --> 14:47.980
And we want our books to go out of print as soon as possible. And the reason for
that being that, well, a couple of reasons. One, we are manufacturing and

14:47.980 --> 15:00.840
selling with a book collector in mind. And a lot of these people are investors.
And they are essentially investing in our books. another reason being that it's

15:00.840 --> 15:11.540
a simple economic reason that Chuck and I are just due to economics are turning
our money over as fast as we can because we don't have an unlimited source we

15:11.540 --> 15:25.900
don't deal with banks the way a major publisher is essentially dealing with a
printer and dealing with banks and a big factor in their business is is the

15:25.900 --> 15:36.920
interest rate because they're dealing in borrowed money and we are not. We're
using our own money and just continuing to reinvest it in what we're doing and

15:36.920 --> 15:46.980
that's how we operate and that's why we're printing very few books. Okay, fine.
You mentioned that both of you had been booksellers and so forth so maybe you

15:46.980 --> 15:59.740
can give me an insight into this. That original printing of the dying earth I
think that probably was what $15.95 when you sent it out. Quite a high price at

15:59.740 --> 16:07.880
the time. What do you think in the hands of collectors that would be worth now
or say in the near future? You think that's appreciated quite a bit already? It

16:07.880 --> 16:23.560
has. I have seen copies in San Francisco of the regular trade edition of that
which came out at $15.95. And I've seen them sell at $50 and $60. And that was

16:23.560 --> 16:38.360
five years ago that was published. Are all your cloth editions first editions?
With a few exceptions, they're mostly first hardcover editions. There were, we

16:38.360 --> 16:48.980
just finished a series called the Demon Prince series, and the first three in
that series had been out in hardcover in England. You couldn't call them cloth

16:48.980 --> 17:01.200
-bound editions because they weren't. But they were cheaply bound with paper
boards. And they were not a very well-made book. In that sense, they were. What

17:01.200 --> 17:10.740
we did was the first cloth-bound edition. But there were these hardcovers that
had been out previously in England. But by and large, all of our books. And

17:10.740 --> 17:23.400
essentially what we're doing is publishing first hardcover editions. That's
essentially our business. We published a book by Silverberg this year that will

17:23.400 --> 17:37.540
be part of a larger collection next year in hardcover. And we may be doing a
book next year by Ursula Le Guin, which Harper will be publishing, and we just

17:37.540 --> 17:47.540
may precede the Harper edition with a 500-copy edition of our own, and we may
precede the Harper edition by three or four months, and our edition would then

17:47.540 --> 18:03.820
be signed and numbered and of a very high quality binding and like that. But by
and large, our whole business is to publish hardcovers and be the first

18:03.820 --> 18:12.420
hardcover edition publisher. That's essentially because we're publishing for
collectors and they want hardcovers and they want first editions. And that's why

18:12.420 --> 18:23.460
a number of our books are signed and numbered for the same reason. Right. Okay.
How do you go about choosing an author to publish? What criteria do you use?

18:23.920 --> 18:42.700
Well, Chuck and I share similar tastes. Our criteria is first that the author be
good and be writing something that's worthwhile. and again we're speaking of

18:42.700 --> 18:54.660
most of the books we're talking about are within fantasy science fiction and
horror genres second they have to have a certain popularity there are some

18:54.660 --> 19:06.180
authors who are who are good who are not collectible or are not popular and we
simply can't afford to publish people like that there are a few people like that

19:06.180 --> 19:20.720
that we would like to publish but cannot we may from time to time do one book by
them we would like to do a book by Avram Davidson who's really quite a good

19:20.720 --> 19:31.520
writer and there are some other writers that we will be doing that may or may
not be collectible and may not be saleable and writers who are trying to do new

19:31.520 --> 19:43.360
things Carl Wagner's trying to do some new things within the horror field and we
may be publishing him but essentially we're taking authors who are already well

19:43.360 --> 19:55.420
-known and popular and whose work has some significance, and because they're not
getting published in hardcover, or in the case maybe of Ursula Le Guin, because

19:55.420 --> 20:06.520
the way that they're making hardcovers these days is so poor of quality, that
these authors want a hardcover edition of their work that's going to be durable

20:06.520 --> 20:19.480
and well-made. And the fact is that the hardcover publishers simply economically
can't do it because they can't sell enough to make it worth their while. So we

20:19.480 --> 20:30.940
step into that void that simple economics, the fact that Japan bought a lot of
lumber in this country and drove the price of paper up, and just other factors

20:30.940 --> 20:43.140
which have driven up the price of books and cut down the number of new books
being published. Odd situations such as the fact that the tax law changed last

20:43.140 --> 20:55.520
year and now publishers are getting stuck with tax for their inventory. And this
is a whole new situation, and it's causing publishers not to have inventory and

20:55.520 --> 21:04.800
to be more careful about what books they publish. So there again, you have fewer
new titles published each year. This is a trend that's going to continue, and

21:04.800 --> 21:15.680
more and more paperback originals. And as long as that trend continues, there
will be a need for people like us who are publishing a small number of hardcover

21:15.680 --> 21:25.320
books for libraries and for people who want to have a library of their own in
their house. Very good. Okay, excellent. Listen, why did you get into the

21:25.320 --> 21:37.180
bibliography aspect of it? What was the intention there? Again, it was in the
same way that Chuck and I got together simply because we both shared a love of

21:37.180 --> 21:53.160
books and a love of Vance's work. Chuck and I were contacted by a man named
Daniel Leevac in Canoga Park, which is Los Angeles, California, and he wanted to

21:53.160 --> 22:04.960
do a bibliography of Jack Vance's work. He'd done one. and we ended up
publishing it. We're now involved in a series of bibliographies. We just

22:04.960 --> 22:18.740
published Philip K. Dick and that bibliography which is annotated and has 200
reproductions of covers is a bibliography like none other. We think it's the

22:18.740 --> 22:29.680
best bibliography of any author that has ever been published. It's actually more
than a bibliography. It deserves a new name and it's primarily due to the work

22:29.680 --> 22:38.400
of Daniel Levack, who's not only a good bibliographer, but he organizes the
projects and he

22:38.400 --> 22:50.200
essentially got in touch with us and he offered his services, which were very
good indeed. And we went along with it simply because he was very eager to do it

22:50.200 --> 23:03.740
and willing to do it. And neither Chuck nor I are bibliographers, but this
fellow was. And he liked what we liked. And, again, the connection was a

23:03.740 --> 23:13.820
personal connection, not a business connection. We're not doing bibliographies
because there's a lot of money in it. There isn't. But we're doing it simply

23:13.820 --> 23:24.700
because we enjoy doing it, and we enjoy working with this fellow, Levack, who
deserves an award of some kind for this Philip K. Dick, which he just put

23:24.700 --> 23:35.680
together and was published. And we'll be continuing because, essentially, he's
doing more. He's got two or three more that he's completed, and, essentially,

23:35.700 --> 23:44.680
we're publishing them because he's doing them, and that's the main reason. okay
which uh which ones after dick do you think will be well he's finished roger

23:44.680 --> 23:57.560
Zelazny and he's finished frank herbert nearly finished and he's working on a
bibliography of L. Sprague de Camp which is 400 pages long it's an enormous work

23:57.560 --> 24:08.700
and the annotations to that work and let me say that all of these bibliographies
now that we've settled on a format are annotated in other in other words, each

24:08.700 --> 24:24.180
novel and each story is briefly summarized in plot and description and in the
case of a writer like Sprague De Camp, this meant about 40,000 words just of

24:24.180 --> 24:34.140
annotations, almost a full-length book just in story descriptions and novel
descriptions and De Camp has written so much and been published...the

24:34.140 --> 24:42.920
bibliography is international, It's been published in so many places that the
bibliography is 300 or 400 pages long. And it won't be that long when it's

24:42.920 --> 24:56.500
typeset. It'll be 200 or 250-odd pages, but it'll be really enormous. It's a
gigantic project. And Dan is doing it, and he's doing such a good job, just such

24:56.500 --> 25:07.620
a remarkable job that we would publish it probably if we lost money on it.
They're just books that need to go out there and see the light of day. Okay,

25:07.740 --> 25:19.260
listen, have you finished the... I used to say Tschai, but when we talked to Jack
Vance, he said Tschai. I say Tschai, even though he says Tschai, because there are some

25:19.260 --> 25:25.660
words that have to sound the same way, and that's one of them, but yeah, go
ahead. Have you finished the last volume, The Pnume, in that series? Yeah, it's

25:25.660 --> 25:37.040
out. Yes, it is finally out. You know, it's funny. Before we go on, I have to
say that some books have a life of their own. Some of these bibliographies will

25:37.040 --> 25:45.220
come out, and they seem to have an impetus of their own to be published, and the
dying earth, that may be true. We may have simply been the instruments of that

25:45.220 --> 26:02.100
book seeing hardcover publication. It may have had some kind of life of its own.
On the other hand, some books refuse to be born, you may say, or maybe they're

26:02.100 --> 26:14.420
jinxed from the start. And that series was one of them. That series, which we
started three, four years ago and intended to finish up in a year or so, and

26:14.420 --> 26:25.740
it's taken that long, and we've had problems with the original illustrator who
he had his own personal problems and couldn't finish. And we had problems

26:25.740 --> 26:36.800
typesetting the book. One of the books was typeset twice. We had just a number
of manufacturing problems. One of the books had to be reprinted completely. It

26:36.800 --> 26:47.680
was an interesting lesson because everything went wrong with that series that
could possibly go wrong. And it eventually did get out. Uh, the last volume at

26:47.680 --> 26:57.600
last, number four, came out in October and Chuck and I both breathed a sigh of
relief. Yeah. Okay. I'm glad I've got the first three. I better get on that

26:57.600 --> 27:07.960
fourth one. Yeah, we're all over the series and I think very highly of those
four books. I enjoy them immensely and I'm happy to say they're out there. Well

27:07.960 --> 27:17.300
yeah, okay, you've really answered this next question all the way through your
answers, I guess, but let me sort of rephrase it anyhow. I take it, then, that

27:17.300 --> 27:30.000
the Underwood-Miller endeavor is really more a labor of love than it is an
attempt to earn money or to... It is both. We are earning a living by it, and we

27:30.000 --> 27:38.520
really have a lot of potential down the road, and I'll let you ask that same
question to Chuck Miller, who's here in just a moment, if you will, but from my

27:38.520 --> 27:45.980
point of view, we are making a living. We've both learned a lot about what we're
doing.

27:49.000 --> 27:59.360
We've associated ourselves with some publishers in New York, and we're
acquainted now with virtually everyone within the field, from publishers,

27:59.540 --> 28:12.080
editors, manufacturers, whatever, who has anything to do with publishing fantasy
and science fiction. We've met other authors who we may at some later date

28:12.080 --> 28:14.000
publish, such as James Covell.

28:17.220 --> 28:28.860
We have just gained a lot of expertise and know-how, and from that point of
view, we could do a lot of other things, and we may be doing other things. We're

28:28.860 --> 28:41.960
now putting together a book about Stephen King. It's a critical collection. We
did a critical book on Jack Vance's work and essentially learned how to do one

28:41.960 --> 28:53.140
by doing one and that's kind of how we've operated from the beginning and now
that we have a little experience there, we're doing one on Stephen King. There's

28:53.140 --> 29:01.380
never been one and we essentially solicited critical pieces from a number of the
other authors in the horror field

29:04.900 --> 29:14.280
who owe a debt to King to some extent because King has popularized the horror
field or who just wanted to say something about King's writing because they

29:14.280 --> 29:24.320
either like it or don't like it. And we put together a number of essays and
critical pieces and we're now editing them and we're going to be publishing that

29:24.320 --> 29:38.380
book as a hardcover ourselves and it will come out as a paperback from a mass
market publisher in New York some later day and so we're able to do a book like

29:38.380 --> 29:48.100
that put together a package like that there's a lot of promise in the future but
what we're doing began as a labor of love and no we're certainly not doing it we

29:48.100 --> 29:59.740
wouldn't do it for money because when you work for yourself I think you end up
working a lot longer hours and working harder that's been that's been my

29:59.740 --> 30:10.420
experience and Chuck's experience too I think and we wouldn't be doing it for
the money no we do it because we like doing it and we really couldn't either of

30:10.420 --> 30:17.680
us conceive of doing anything else okay excellent well listen I would have one
more question for you and then maybe I could ask a couple of Chuck before we let

30:17.680 --> 30:29.760
you go very good as a friend of Jack Vance I've always Vance to me is the
greatest writer going you know I've worshipped him for a long time I guess I

30:29.760 --> 30:38.220
don't know how to phrase the question I've always been let me just give a couple
thoughts maybe you can just respond to them in a personal way first of all I've

30:38.220 --> 30:47.200
always been amazed at the lack of recognition for a writer of his abilities I
don't think he's gotten the recognition he deserved until recently and I don't

30:47.200 --> 31:01.700
even think he's gotten it now also oh his uniqueness I think he's he's awfully
unique in his style, his ideas, his abilities. When we talked to him, he didn't

31:01.700 --> 31:07.460
think he was unique at all. He was just a craftsman going about his job and he
didn't see anything special or different or etc.

31:10.140 --> 31:19.220
Could you just sort of respond what attracted you to Vance and your relationship
with him? I'll tell you a little bit about that, yeah. I think Jack has

31:19.220 --> 31:28.060
accomplished some things with some of his works that have just never been done
before. not only in terms of style, but in terms of feeling.

31:32.160 --> 31:45.760
He hearkens to a certain spirit, I think. I mean, a certain kind of person or a
certain kind of spirit is on his wavelength and responds strongly to his work.

31:47.900 --> 31:58.440
The latter part of his work and the best of his work is extremely well-crafted.
He's a craftsman, very well written, and accomplishes a lot of really unusual

31:58.440 --> 32:10.860
things in a very quiet way. And the Tafflinger book called Jack Vance, which
contains some critical essays on him, explains a little bit about how and why he

32:10.860 --> 32:21.300
goes about that, how he accomplishes what he does. My feeling is that one

32:21.300 --> 32:37.580
responds strongly to Vance one who feels much the same way about the world that
he does I think why isn't he though as popular as say John Likere who I think

32:37.580 --> 32:53.060
people respond to in the same way Vance is more of a rarefied taste I think he's
the kind of things that he feels are important the strangeness in the world

32:53.060 --> 33:04.760
about us and the unusual qualities of life itself. Those kind of considerations
are not important to a lot of people. People who do feel these things strongly

33:04.760 --> 33:11.980
are going to like what Vance writes. They're going to enjoy reading. They're
going to enjoy the worlds that he's created.

33:14.840 --> 33:26.300
I think that... Partly, Vance has been kind of a recluse and has refused to
promote his own work and refused to be involved in that. For a number of years,

33:26.340 --> 33:42.900
he was misrepresented as agent, in my opinion, and the opinion of, well, in my
opinion, his agent did not do much work for him. Vance now has an agent who was

33:42.900 --> 33:56.360
working for him, Kirby McCauley, and that has done a great deal to turn Vance's
career around. And Vance recently has been reviewed in the LA Times and the

33:56.360 --> 34:12.020
Washington Post in the past year, and he's beginning to get some recognition.
And Vance is just completing a book called, as you may know, Lioness. And it's a

34:12.020 --> 34:15.460
very large, major work of fantasy.

34:18.180 --> 34:29.440
and this book also will, I think, establish his career or make people pay
attention. Jack is, he's not done a lot of the things that make other writers

34:29.440 --> 34:45.140
successful. Like he's never stayed with one character the way that, say, LeCray
stayed with Smiley or the way that someone writes a Doc Savage novel 15 times in

34:45.140 --> 35:01.640
a row or whatever. He hasn't done that. And he hasn't had one hero that he's
repeated for any great number of books and he hasn't had one contemporary theme

35:01.640 --> 35:15.960
that appeals to people like the battle of the sexes or something like that.
Those aren't Jack's themes. Jack's consideration themes are enormously subtle

35:17.280 --> 35:27.580
and kind of a rarefied nature, and that's as best as I can answer that question.
That's about what I would say, too. It's hard to pin him down, I agree.

35:31.740 --> 35:40.780
Well, just a minute, David. I just want to ask Chuck a few questions. We could
do that. I'll call him back. Do you hear a lot of static? David? There's a bit

35:40.780 --> 35:48.220
in the background, yeah. David says we're getting a lot here. Listen, I just had
a few questions to ask of Chuck, so maybe, can we just call you back for just a

35:48.220 --> 35:55.820
couple more? Okay, I'll hang up and call back and check on. Yeah, it'll just be
a few minutes more. Thank you. That's fine. Okay, I'll get you in a second. Very

35:55.820 --> 35:56.040
good.

35:59.020 --> 36:05.780
Are you rolling, David? Yes. Yeah, we're rolling the tape.
Listen, I have a couple questions that would be in the same general area that

36:05.780 --> 36:13.400
you probably had heard Tim Underwood respond to, but from what you heard, do you
have any kinds of comments or additions to what he was saying on anything in

36:13.400 --> 36:18.740
particular before I get down to some? No. Whatever you have in mind. Okay.

36:21.580 --> 36:29.760
Oh, let's see. How about... I don't think I ever got a specific... He sort of
interwoved through his answers a statement, sort of a statement on the purpose

36:29.760 --> 36:39.440
of Underwood Miller. Could you sort of synthesize that for me? Well, I believe
that basic purpose is that this fantasy and science fiction literature will

36:39.440 --> 36:51.060
simply endure and will simply continue to be read for hundreds and possibly
another thousand years, as long as this sort of literature is read and enjoyed.

36:52.260 --> 37:09.140
The books that we publish will be read again and again by future generations.
It's a real grasp on the future here. I guess you've heard Tim talk about, oh,

37:09.640 --> 37:17.540
you know, the cloth bindings and the paper without acid in. I don't know if you
realize the distinction there that most books just don't have that. You know,

37:17.600 --> 37:27.780
the paper, they have acid in them, so it dissolves the wood pulp. and the
bindings are made cheap so that after you read them, oh say three or four times

37:27.780 --> 37:38.200
or a paperback, you read it a couple times and it falls apart on you. But these
books that we make are going to last and as they are manufactured to last, the

37:38.200 --> 37:52.620
literature in them, the words and the contents, we believe have a lasting value
so that this will continue to be enjoyed again and again. Okay, very good. You

37:52.620 --> 38:00.360
know, Tim said a lot of things about this too, who maybe you could synthesize
this for me. What would be the difference between Underwood Miller edition and,

38:00.520 --> 38:10.140
say, the edition of a major publisher, a hardback in each case, in terms of how
the book is put together? We work a little closer to the line than a large

38:10.140 --> 38:22.440
publisher. They simply have more avenues to explore as far as distribution goes.
So they're able to print more copies and sell more books, whereas we are dealing

38:22.440 --> 38:36.500
with a specific market basically designed for libraries and people who collect
this literature. So what we're trying to do is not exactly, but sort of like the

38:36.500 --> 38:46.080
Franklin men, although they do these massive editions and they're kind of open
-ended. What they do is they'll take an order in for their edition is limited to

38:46.080 --> 38:55.420
as many people as order it, whereas ours are strictly limited to, say, a
thousand copies, whatever we state to begin with. That's pretty much what it is.

38:56.040 --> 39:12.160
So whereas a larger publisher would sell however many they can conceivably sell
with their six-figure ad budget, well, we only sell a thousand. That's basically

39:12.160 --> 39:26.920
it. Otherwise, we all go through the same things in manufacturing and design. We
put possibly a little more care, but a lot less money into our design factors in

39:26.920 --> 39:37.900
making a book what it should be. When you design a book, you look at it and you
have to absorb from the story what factors occur to you as to how the book

39:37.900 --> 39:47.400
should be presented in a physical form. and a larger publisher can spend an
awful lot of money and still not come up with a good design, we feel we don't

39:47.400 --> 39:55.920
spend as much money, and we do come up with a good design. Now when you say
design, what exactly do you mean? Do you mean the kind of type, the chapter

39:55.920 --> 40:04.980
headings, the style of numbering? What is involved? The type actually enters
into it. It's the whole, the whole book. What kind of paper should be used on

40:04.980 --> 40:15.620
the dust wrapper? Should it be illustrated? If it should be illustrated, by whom
should it be illustrated different styles of illustrators lend themselves to

40:15.620 --> 40:28.900
certain works in certain ways you know what kind of cloth what color of the book
should be all these factors add into what is the design of the book and they're

40:28.900 --> 40:43.380
all considered every point is considered okay how do you choose an illustrator
well basically working from the text Some texts are more action oriented and we

40:43.380 --> 40:56.660
go to an artist who has this in his style. Not every artist can do everything.
And we try to choose one who's suitable for the work. Other texts are more, say,

40:56.980 --> 41:10.760
intellectually oriented. They're a little more slow paced, more cerebral than
physical and action. And, well, they call for a certain other type of

41:10.760 --> 41:21.720
illustration. That's all. Okay, do you ever respond to anybody like collectors
and so forth in choosing your books, or is it just between you and Tim Underwood

41:21.720 --> 41:30.480
as to what you do? As to... What you publish. At our editorial choice, you mean?
Yeah, I mean, which authors and which books you pick? I mean, do you respond, I

41:30.480 --> 41:37.960
mean, if a collector says, okay, why don't you do so-and-so next year or
something? Yeah, we get an awful lot of that kind of stuff. People have all

41:37.960 --> 41:47.800
kinds of ideas of what they would like, their favorite author, their favorite
book. And a lot of it, with Vance's stuff in particular, stuff that we've had in

41:47.800 --> 41:57.780
mind for a while and just haven't gotten to, although lately we've gotten to a
lot of it. We've filled in a lot of the gaps that we had left for the past few

41:57.780 --> 42:07.920
years, meaning that we just got caught up with some of our scheduling. other
people have different authors that they of course would like to see or a

42:07.920 --> 42:17.340
particular story that they know see a lot of these people have not so much
inside information but personal information with the author meaning that they'll

42:17.340 --> 42:26.280
have a favorite author and they'll realize that the guy has say an unpublished
mystery manuscript lying around and they'll say well you should publish this

42:26.280 --> 42:37.780
guy's mystery manuscript and that's all well and good and we listen to it, but
when it really gets down to it, it's our money on the line, so we make the

42:37.780 --> 42:48.560
decision. That's good. Yeah, it's the only way we can. Okay, listen, Tim was
saying that I got the impression, his last few answers, that you're thinking of

42:48.560 --> 42:57.060
expanding some, or at least there's a possibility of such. Could you respond to
that? Like, I mean, doing different kinds of things and just expanding? Is that

42:57.060 --> 43:11.120
possible? Well, yes and no. Expanding in terms of book packaging is certainly
possible. And that seems to be the direction in which we are heading. It's a

43:11.120 --> 43:23.120
different challenge to us. All of this is a challenge. We've never really kind
of sat still on what we've been doing. We kind of keep at it and work on it,

43:23.280 --> 43:37.020
make it a little bit better, make it a little bit smoother. Just make it work a
little better. As far as physically doing more books, well, there's not that

43:37.020 --> 43:46.960
much more we could do. I'd say our maximum number of books that two people can
do in a year would be 15. After that, if we start sponsoring more books, we're

43:46.960 --> 43:50.280
not going to do as good a job on each book

43:53.740 --> 44:06.000
than if we would just limit ourselves and limit our attentions and our energies
to just these certain number of projects. If we just take more, if we bite off

44:06.000 --> 44:18.340
more than we can chew, we're going to be up the creek. That's kind of it, too.
too. So yeah, there is expansion going on, but not so much in physical terms of

44:18.340 --> 44:26.880
the number of books. Yeah, okay. Listen, I think we've probably taken enough of
your time. Our tape is just about out here. I wanted to say just personally,

44:27.020 --> 44:36.120
just to thank both of you for what you're doing. I'm exactly the kind of reader
and collector that you were aiming at. I've got over half your books, I've

44:36.120 --> 44:43.640
collected them, and that was what I thought. I said, boy, this is great. I want
these books because they're going to last. I have an old beat-up copy of Dying

44:43.640 --> 44:52.240
Earth and I read it so much it's falling apart. So what you intended to do for a
lot of people is being done and I appreciate it. Thank you very much. It was

44:52.240 --> 44:59.200
really nice talking with you. Well listen, David would like, is Tim Underwood
still there? Yeah. Yeah, David would like
