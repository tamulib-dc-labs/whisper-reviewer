00:01.240 --> 00:02.500
How's things out in California?

00:02.820 --> 00:03.800
Weather holding up out there?

00:04.260 --> 00:05.200
Weather looks nice.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.140
It's getting a little windy and a little cooler.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.200
Yeah, it's getting kind of crisp here too.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.560
Okay, I want to ask you a few questions about things in general

00:13.560 --> 00:15.440
and about some of the specific works too maybe.

00:17.060 --> 00:20.480
First of all, let me make sure that my tape machine is rolling

00:20.480 --> 00:20.860
in yonder.

00:21.360 --> 00:21.780
Are we rolling?

00:24.380 --> 00:27.060
Okay. First of all, do you classify yourself

00:27.060 --> 00:32.420
as a hard science writer with stories for the most part having a strong scientific base?

00:33.820 --> 00:37.060
If you've got the class of Jaime, that's where I sit.

00:37.300 --> 00:38.580
Yes, I would.

00:39.400 --> 00:43.680
I suppose all writers resist classification as best they can.

00:44.660 --> 00:46.520
I do other things too.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.560
Fantasy, considerable fantasy, a great deal more hard science fiction,

00:53.560 --> 00:56.560
not much in the way of soft science fiction.

00:58.520 --> 01:05.840
Articles, speeches, I'm the guy who did a study of the medical problems of breeding

01:05.840 --> 01:09.560
Kryptonians called Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex.

01:10.180 --> 01:14.300
And I just published the only venture I've ever made into economics,

01:15.120 --> 01:19.180
a method which would also solve the problem of nuclear waste disposal.

01:19.720 --> 01:20.880
Maybe you saw it in Omni.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.100
Mm-hmm.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.620
The idea is to turn the nuclear waste into coins.

01:27.980 --> 01:31.200
Healthy economy is one in which the money circulates fast.

01:32.720 --> 01:33.180
Uh-huh.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.340
You mentioned that you didn't write much of the soft science fiction.

01:38.960 --> 01:43.240
Do you think that the new wave is passed back to strong science-oriented stories?

01:43.460 --> 01:44.240
Or is that a good thing?

01:44.840 --> 01:45.760
Yes, I do.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.080
However, the new wave was very good to me.

01:50.220 --> 01:56.100
Uh, when I was first getting started, I was the only new hard science fiction writer.

01:56.580 --> 01:59.060
The new wave is a very persuasive thing,

01:59.380 --> 02:04.080
and very easy to use to justify bad stories.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.780
I think that's what killed it.

02:07.160 --> 02:17.000
Not that increased characterization and experiments with typography and story format

02:17.000 --> 02:22.920
are a bad thing in themselves, but it's so easy to use new wave to justify a bad story.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.260
It was bound to go out.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.420
How did you begin writing science fiction?

02:29.540 --> 02:31.560
Have you always been a science fiction reader or fan?

02:32.160 --> 02:32.320
Yes.

02:33.700 --> 02:39.440
And presently, I found I was making up, I was daydreaming stories that seemed worth writing.

02:42.100 --> 02:46.940
Did you tell the stories before you began to get to where you could write

02:46.940 --> 02:47.440
them down?

02:47.760 --> 02:50.120
Yes, I've been a storyteller all my life.

02:54.660 --> 02:57.960
You must have a large, I know you have a large fan group.

02:58.140 --> 02:59.620
Do they keep in contact with you regularly?

02:59.840 --> 03:03.680
Do you write ever for the fans or do you just write what you want to write?

03:04.460 --> 03:10.860
I mostly write for myself, for an imaginary reader who resembles me a great deal.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.520
Only he needs things explained to him.

03:16.040 --> 03:21.020
Beyond that, I sell it where I can and pick up readers where I can.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.320
I might ask you here a little bit about the known space series.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.220
How did that begin?

03:33.400 --> 03:35.440
How did you get involved in a future history?

03:37.100 --> 03:39.820
Well, there had been future histories around.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.320
Uh, Poole Anderson's and uh, Robert Heinlein's.

03:45.940 --> 03:52.160
And I tell you, I guess we each evolved the idea somewhat independently.

03:52.160 --> 03:57.720
And the idea is that if you carved out a consistent, workable future,

03:58.260 --> 04:01.060
it seems a shame to waste it on one story.

04:02.120 --> 04:06.220
You put in the background because you want the uh, you want the

04:07.180 --> 04:10.600
background of a story to seem bigger than it is.

04:10.860 --> 04:12.980
So there are things that are simply unexplained.

04:16.720 --> 04:21.640
And if you think of more to say on a given subject, why you go with it?

04:21.800 --> 04:25.960
And if you think of a story that fits into the background of a previous story,

04:26.040 --> 04:28.100
it allows you to elaborate on that background.

04:28.580 --> 04:30.720
You sometimes you fall in love with the background.

04:31.860 --> 04:34.400
And presently you've got a bunch of stories that link.

04:37.320 --> 04:43.340
You said that your future history was finished when you wrote the Ringworld Engineers and the

04:43.340 --> 04:46.800
afterwards. Uh, is that still true? And if so, why?

04:47.480 --> 04:53.780
Oh, I've given up saying that the uh, that the known space series is dating.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.940
There's just no point in it.

04:56.060 --> 05:00.420
I've written five books worth of known space stories since I said that.

05:00.420 --> 05:07.340
And besides that, I have no doubt that I'll come up with stories said in the gill in gilly arms

05:07.340 --> 05:10.480
time. I like writing science fiction detective stories.

05:11.820 --> 05:16.500
It just, it's just hard work. I do not have a detective story in my head.

05:16.820 --> 05:17.760
It'll have to emerge.

05:19.200 --> 05:24.220
But that's the beginning of known space and I'll continue to work with it where it looks like fun.

05:25.620 --> 05:32.960
You've written, like you said, some science, uh, detective stories and also some other areas.

05:33.480 --> 05:38.620
Is there any area or any subject that can't be done for science fiction that you think of?

05:42.480 --> 05:49.020
No, I can't think of any. I guess I go along with the idea that there are these interlocked

05:49.020 --> 05:54.420
circles to represent various areas of fiction and they all swim in the sea of fantasy.

05:55.100 --> 06:00.520
Science fiction probably includes the entire portion of fantasy that is possible.

06:01.920 --> 06:06.940
And uh, mainstream would be somewhere in there and nurse novels would be somewhere in that.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.080
You follow?

06:11.700 --> 06:16.640
There would be no subject you could treat in English that couldn't be treated in a science

06:16.640 --> 06:22.260
fiction format except fantasy and that would be treated in a fantasy format.

06:22.900 --> 06:29.580
I see. I understand that in Ring World that's, well first of all let me ask you, how did,

06:29.640 --> 06:32.600
how did the Ring World itself, the concept come about?

06:33.360 --> 06:40.820
Oh, I ran across the concept Dyson's spear. Dyson the mathematician came up with the concept

06:40.820 --> 06:48.120
Dyson's shell and he was misunderstood to some extent. So presently I ran across an article

06:48.120 --> 06:56.240
about Dyson's spear. A picture that is a golf ball 93 million miles in radius with a sun at the

06:56.240 --> 07:02.880
center and gravity generators all around the outside so he would live on the inside, terraform

07:03.520 --> 07:12.020
with uh oceans and soil and air. I ran across that and I didn't like it. I thought it could be

07:12.020 --> 07:19.040
improved and I wound up with the Ring World. I believe you mentioned somewhere that uh,

07:19.540 --> 07:24.280
Mr. Dyson or someone had thought that maybe a whole bunch of small Ring Worlds would be

07:24.280 --> 07:31.740
superior to the one large one. That was Freeman Dyson's reaction. I believe I gave an acceptable

07:31.740 --> 07:39.600
answer to that in the Ring World engineers but in general he'd be right. It's just that the

07:40.300 --> 07:47.720
Ring World engineers in particular are people who like dependable weapons of huge size.

07:49.660 --> 07:55.400
I understand that some fans pointed out errors in the Ring World, the original novel.

07:55.400 --> 08:02.300
Do you know what were the basic errors and how did you correct them through that?

08:02.700 --> 08:08.500
Column errors and elaborations because some of them don't really fit the error thing. It's just

08:08.500 --> 08:15.060
something that hadn't gotten into the original book. For instance, I suspect that the Ring World

08:15.060 --> 08:21.580
was unstable and I suspected you'd eat attitude jets. I was sure that the Ring World was spinning

08:21.580 --> 08:26.680
fast enough to permit Lysard Ramjet to be used as attitude jets which means you don't have a

08:26.680 --> 08:34.420
fuel problem at all. You're burning the solar wind. But uh, rapidly some MIT people demonstrated

08:34.420 --> 08:39.540
that the Ring World was unstable and they were chanting it in the halls at the next Worldcon.

08:39.760 --> 08:48.120
The Ring World is unstable. The Ring World is unstable. It still took about seven years for

08:48.120 --> 08:53.280
anyone to figure out the exact numbers for the instability and they are horrifying. The Ring

08:53.280 --> 09:00.340
World, a major solar flare would have the Ring World grinding against its sun in five years.

09:03.260 --> 09:11.700
Well, I worked it into a plot. That was one elaboration or error. Another just can't be

09:11.700 --> 09:16.800
correct. It seems that there's too much twilight with the shadow squares set up the way I have them

09:16.800 --> 09:24.240
set up. You get too much of neither day nor night but twilight. Uh, half the sun showing,

09:24.600 --> 09:31.300
part of the sun showing. The shadow squares ought to be set up with about five big shadow squares

09:32.080 --> 09:41.360
moving in a retrograde world. That way you get day and night setting much faster when it when it sits.

09:43.100 --> 09:47.340
Terminate, terminate or line moves like a bat out of hell. It's still a little fuzzy,

09:47.400 --> 09:55.980
which doesn't matter. Uh, third point, somebody pointed out that the tensile strength necessary

09:55.980 --> 10:00.580
to hold the Ring World together is on the order of the tensile strength of an atomic nucleus.

10:01.060 --> 10:07.900
It's the super strong force. Okay, I can live with that. I can postulate that. I knew

10:07.900 --> 10:12.160
this grip would have to be stronger than any normal material already.

10:14.020 --> 10:20.440
Fourth point, some high school class in Florida got to work on the Ring World.

10:21.280 --> 10:26.800
And their conclusion was that the Ring World's worst problem is that on the top soil would wind

10:26.800 --> 10:33.660
up in the oceans in about 3,000 years. There are no earthquakes on the Ring World. No, not in building

10:33.660 --> 10:43.100
forces. Okay, uh, that's a tough one. I set up a spill pipe system that runs the top, that runs the

10:43.100 --> 10:49.100
sea bottom muck from the sea bottoms under the Ring World and up over the edge of the Ring Rim Wall.

10:50.860 --> 11:00.320
That even allows you some, uh, some mines accumulation of useful metals.

11:01.840 --> 11:12.280
What else? Checking in my head. I find, uh, Frank Gisperic's suggestion that a machine

11:12.280 --> 11:18.200
building culture on the Ring World, which reached our level, wouldn't have any petroleum products to

11:18.200 --> 11:25.700
use. They would wind up using alcohol, uh, where we use gasoline. And fine, I can live with that.

11:25.700 --> 11:34.620
As a matter of fact, the sludge from, uh, making alcohol for automobiles, the sludge can be used

11:34.620 --> 11:43.480
to make plastics, maybe plastic like substances, maybe. Uh, the chemicals are adjusted as elaborate,

11:43.820 --> 11:52.420
as those, as the residues from petroleum. Um, it's quenching. Yeah. What else?

11:53.240 --> 11:59.760
Still checking in my head. I pick up on other things I can't use, such as Dan Alderson's solar

11:59.760 --> 12:05.360
system, which involves four Ring World. He's got three Ring Worlds about the size of mine,

12:07.520 --> 12:14.560
rotating orthogonally on frictionless bearings. And the fourth Ring World is, uh, about the size

12:14.560 --> 12:20.880
of the orbit of Jupiter and inhabited by mesquilinites. Mesquilinites derived from a novel by Hal

12:20.880 --> 12:31.380
Klemann, mission of gravity and mesquilinites require, uh, cold temperatures about those of the

12:31.380 --> 12:37.100
orbit of Jupiter as opposed to Jupiter, which has an internal heat source, cold temperatures and

12:37.100 --> 12:42.440
heavy gravity. So there, so his fourth Ring World is the size of the orbit of Jupiter and spinning

12:42.440 --> 12:48.120
like a bat out of hell. I had it figured out that if, if they spun that Ring World any faster,

12:48.120 --> 12:51.980
it would get nearer the speed of light and contract.

12:52.860 --> 12:59.820
Dan says I've misunderstood relativity. It would not contract. Okay. I still haven't figured out. Why not?

13:02.840 --> 13:08.540
Well, you obviously enjoy playing the game as Hal Klemann calls it between your own scientific

13:08.540 --> 13:14.760
knowledge and that of your readers and peers. Absolutely. I incorporated everything that sounded

13:14.760 --> 13:20.220
good that I could use in redesign, in elaborating the design of the Ring World.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.140
What do you think about the current ideas being proposed by Gerardo Neal and others for space

13:27.140 --> 13:36.260
habitats? I think they are grandiose and I certainly wouldn't stop him, but the space program seems to

13:36.260 --> 13:43.000
have fallen flat on its face at this point. We will have trouble reaching the moon again,

13:43.700 --> 13:47.260
getting back to the moon is, is as big a problem as we can face.

13:48.960 --> 13:53.340
I resent having to say that, but I believe it's true.

13:56.620 --> 14:03.500
How do you go about constructing aliens with particular reference to the moats, to the moaties?

14:04.180 --> 14:06.020
Were you influenced by anyone in that area?

14:07.080 --> 14:16.920
The moaties were, no, not in that case. In that case, I had the idea that I was following a

14:16.920 --> 14:27.220
progression with a protozoan, with an amoeba. You get radio symmetry inside and out. Move up a

14:27.220 --> 14:32.000
goodly distance and you find starfishes with radio symmetry on the outside and bilateral

14:32.000 --> 14:37.680
symmetry on the inside. Move up a little further, you find flat worms and worms of all

14:37.680 --> 14:46.380
stance at the level of bilateral symmetry inside and out. Go as far as a human, you find bilateral

14:47.120 --> 14:55.340
symmetry on the outside and no symmetry, well, half symmetrical on the inside. The lungs look

14:55.340 --> 15:00.600
symmetrical, the kidneys look symmetrical, the intestines look like somebody dropped a plate

15:00.600 --> 15:09.740
of spaghetti. I've tried to move on to the next step, bilaterally unsymmetrical on the outside

15:10.420 --> 15:17.600
and I got the original moatie, which was the engineer for them. But I always design aliens

15:18.560 --> 15:24.920
for themselves. I almost never design an alien to match a story. The story,

15:26.220 --> 15:30.940
some story will eventually include the alien. The alien stands for itself.

15:33.440 --> 15:41.000
How did you come up with the concept of cowardice embodied in the Pearson's puppeteers?

15:41.740 --> 15:43.700
Well, we just seemed an idea worth exploring.

15:45.720 --> 15:52.580
I think one of the outstanding aspects on the moaties, back to them for a minute, was the

15:52.580 --> 15:56.920
non-use of standardized parts and machines. They built whatever they needed on the spot.

15:57.580 --> 16:00.240
Do you recall what made you think along those lines?

16:00.840 --> 16:09.740
I was just playing along. I was just playing with ideas at that point and that one seemed like a

16:09.740 --> 16:18.080
fun one. It also seemed likely enough if you've got a critter with not much intelligence accepting

16:18.080 --> 16:27.700
the direction of toolmaking and tool altering. Then why not? The thing has to keep testing its

16:27.700 --> 16:33.980
ability or it will lose it. It might as well be designing something every time it needs a specific

16:33.980 --> 16:44.820
machine. One other master can always stop it and have it producing as if by assembly line. If a

16:44.820 --> 16:47.060
master needs a lot of something fast.

16:51.300 --> 16:58.500
One other specific question and this jumps back to Ringworld a moment was concerning the tea,

16:58.600 --> 17:03.860
the brown gene. Was this more or less a story gimmick or were you extrapolating on the

17:05.660 --> 17:07.740
evolution of humanity there?

17:08.300 --> 17:16.260
Oh partly that and partly you've got to remember the time I was writing. I was damn sick and tired

17:16.260 --> 17:24.120
of psychic powers showing up in stories. I did not believe in psychic powers at that time. I've been

17:24.120 --> 17:34.320
told they look pretty good now but at the time I can see the tea, the brown gene as being the

17:34.320 --> 17:44.760
ultimate psychic power which you may interpret either as luck or as author control. And in that

17:44.760 --> 17:50.660
sense it was something of a put on except that I can believe almost anything while I'm writing the

17:50.660 --> 18:00.440
story and I am able to extrapolate. So if Tila Brown is lucky certain things emerge and if she's

18:00.440 --> 18:06.100
just a statistical fool then something else emerges and that's that people will interpret

18:06.100 --> 18:12.360
anything that happens to her as luck. Defending their preconception.

18:15.280 --> 18:19.760
What do you do you consider to be your your best work or your favorite work?

18:21.060 --> 18:30.140
No I couldn't tell you that. There is no way I can name a favorite work. The whole my career is

18:30.140 --> 18:37.420
progression for one thing. I take any novel or any important short story even out of that

18:37.420 --> 18:44.000
progression and it wanders away in a different direction. So I don't think I have a favorite

18:44.000 --> 18:53.120
story but but I suppose I can name inconstant moon which is virtually the only strictly love story

18:53.120 --> 19:00.540
I haven't written. And I suppose I could name lucifer's hammer which made me the most money.

19:02.800 --> 19:12.160
So a modian god's eye made me that. I suppose I could name uh oh man of steel woman of queen

19:12.160 --> 19:18.840
eggs which has gotten me the most laughs I suppose. Everybody seems to have read it. Those who haven't

19:18.840 --> 19:30.380
heard about it a cocktail party or what? Jerry Pornel and I just recently wrote

19:30.940 --> 19:36.400
the last 10 minutes for a movie that had a good 90 minutes followed by a bad last 10 minutes.

19:36.940 --> 19:41.700
And the last I've heard is they're not going to make the movie which is a dirty shame.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.660
That is they're not going to make the last 10 minutes hour away. They're going to fiddle with

19:45.660 --> 19:52.740
what they've got. And that's a really dirty shame. What they've got is garbage. I really hope they

19:52.740 --> 19:58.620
use that last 10 minutes and if they do I will get considerable enjoyment out of that and that'll

19:58.620 --> 20:05.240
be my favorite. You name it. You mentioned your collaboration with with Jerry Pornel. Which do

20:05.240 --> 20:13.860
you prefer writing alone or with another person like that? I prefer variety. In fact I even prefer

20:13.860 --> 20:20.740
a variety of my collaborators. I just finished a novel with a Stephen Barnes and we're starting

20:20.740 --> 20:31.040
another a short one and Jerry and I are starting another almost instantly. The novel about uh

20:31.860 --> 20:40.060
well we designed an alien that could invade the earth and also would want

20:41.900 --> 20:48.820
it's tough to get an alien whom you could believe would want to invade the earth from another star

20:48.820 --> 20:54.780
considering the distances involved and the energy involved and the penalties for failure

20:55.420 --> 21:02.480
and the lack of the unlikelihood that it will do your home planet any good if you conquer

21:02.480 --> 21:09.460
something that is six light years away. Anyway we've designed one and we will be writing a novel

21:09.460 --> 21:17.860
about that. When you collaborate with someone like that who does what job do you get that get

21:17.860 --> 21:28.320
involved with uh being hard to decide who does what? Hard sometimes but it always resolves.

21:28.780 --> 21:34.880
The question is who is more who is most qualified to write a given scene that we have both decided

21:34.880 --> 21:43.000
needs writing okay uh before we start we have the novel all laid out we know what's going in

21:43.000 --> 21:49.980
virtually everywhere and if we don't it feels like we do and if we find out we don't we elaborate as

21:49.980 --> 21:55.920
we get to that section. Okay the next question is who is qualified to write a given scene and

21:55.920 --> 22:02.300
sometimes it's obvious if we're dealing with a madman he's mine if we're dealing with military

22:02.300 --> 22:12.000
operations it's Jerry's aliens are generally mine politics is generally Jerry's knowledge of history

22:12.000 --> 22:20.360
generally Jerry's and a real evil son of a bitch Jerry usually creates him and I usually run with him

22:20.360 --> 22:28.940
afterwards because Jerry has a lot of textbooks on psychology and uh PhD in psychology for that

22:28.940 --> 22:37.380
matter sorry doctorate in psychology and when he's created a really evil son of a bitch he just

22:37.380 --> 22:42.840
hates him too much to work with him I can easily do something Horace Barryworth went that way and

22:42.840 --> 22:48.900
the rapist in Lucifer's hammer and a couple of the characters in Inferno.

22:51.940 --> 22:57.660
Understand that both uh you and Mr. Bernal use uh word processors how does that aid in your writing?

22:59.100 --> 23:06.680
It makes first draft a little faster but it makes corrections enormously faster.

23:07.380 --> 23:11.160
You get a more polished novel when I'm using a word processor.

23:12.460 --> 23:15.760
It's polishing is just like sinking into the machine almost.

23:18.200 --> 23:23.180
Uh the word processor behaves like a magic typewriter it does everything you would want

23:23.180 --> 23:29.160
a typewriter to do only it can't it can't erase whole blocks of printed at time and then straighten

23:29.160 --> 23:34.060
up the page so it looks like you never made any corrections but a word processor can do just that

23:35.820 --> 23:40.980
and move blocks up and down the page up and down the manuscript.

23:44.720 --> 23:50.520
That's a what more grandiose question I suppose uh what do you think is the future of science fiction

23:50.520 --> 23:55.620
is is fantasy taking over or do you see foresee a lot of hard science fiction to come?

23:57.380 --> 24:04.040
Hard to say for one thing uh writers in general don't take orders where the damn

24:04.940 --> 24:10.180
science the science fiction field is galloping off in all directions just as it always has

24:11.060 --> 24:13.960
and the reader will make the final decision in most cases

24:15.280 --> 24:18.900
what will be successful it'll depend on who buys what books

24:20.860 --> 24:22.220
that's always been true.

24:26.440 --> 24:33.820
I know that some of your works were involved uh with the animated Star Trek episodes a few years

24:33.820 --> 24:41.460
back uh how did that start did you know? Oh it went like this uh they were gonna start a

24:41.460 --> 24:48.740
Star Trek cartoon and uh the lady who was story editor got me involved

24:50.620 --> 24:56.780
I tried to give them a story that involved a mini black hole and uh an outsider ship

24:56.780 --> 25:03.300
you remember the outsiders from known space? Certainly. I had the idea that Star Trek had

25:03.300 --> 25:08.400
been using many rubber suits for so long that they wouldn't realize how much more freedom they had

25:08.400 --> 25:14.340
with the animated version that turns out not to be the case they had some very good agents in there

25:15.220 --> 25:20.880
but uh that story turned out to be a little over over the heads of their intended audience

25:23.240 --> 25:30.680
so I want it it did incidentally wind up as as the first version of the uh last part of a story

25:30.680 --> 25:38.080
called the border of the soul so I eventually wound up meeting Gene Roddenberry and he wound up

25:38.080 --> 25:45.420
suggesting why don't I take a story called the soft weapon and turn it into a start into a Star Trek version

25:46.460 --> 25:55.840
and I did that and called it the slave weapon and fine they eventually made a cartoon out of it

25:55.840 --> 26:03.720
they also sold the right to turn that cartoon script into a story they sold that to Ballantyne

26:04.540 --> 26:10.620
I got mildly upset the president of the civil who was Jerry Pornel at the time got seriously upset

26:11.340 --> 26:17.680
and started making as many waves as he could and what eventually happened was that they sent me a

26:17.680 --> 26:23.880
dollar for uh a check for two dollars and something something sent somewhere between two and three dollars

26:25.580 --> 26:33.240
and Jerry I don't know where the negotiations went but Jerry wound up saying okay that defends

26:33.240 --> 26:40.860
the principle of the thing uh we'll ask for more next time and that's that for some years but by then

26:40.860 --> 26:47.240
I had written to Ballantyne and gotten a letter from Betty Ballantyne saying hey we won't ever use it

26:47.240 --> 26:52.120
we promise we see you're upset we promise we won't ever do anything with this

26:53.120 --> 26:59.700
uh a little later the Ballantyne got out of the uh Ballantyne books business and and into the business

26:59.700 --> 27:06.000
of printing uh illustrated stuff and Judy Lindell Ray wound up in charge and presently

27:07.500 --> 27:14.740
presently I'm being offered two thousand bucks as advisors to Alan Dean Foster who will turn my

27:14.740 --> 27:21.800
script into a novel and I said fine when I what I really meant was acceptable

27:22.600 --> 27:27.620
two months later I've got a letter from Judy Lind dropping the price to five hundred and I pulled my

27:27.620 --> 27:37.140
top I said a I won't collaborate with with uh you or Alan on anything of the kind and B you may not

27:37.140 --> 27:44.180
use anything from known space except what's in the script and that is the way it happened Alan did

27:44.180 --> 27:52.560
not use anything except what was in the script which involves Cindy and the history of the flavors

27:53.100 --> 28:00.060
and the stasis box are there any uh plans for motion picture television versus any of your

28:00.060 --> 28:07.440
works in the future yes there are uh I just don't know how far they are going to go but there is

28:07.440 --> 28:15.340
there is a group that owns an option on on death by ecstasy and a guy who owns an option on the modian

28:15.340 --> 28:27.460
guys eye and let's see I've got a friend trying to get public broadcasting system to make a tv

28:27.460 --> 28:34.440
version of lucid of uh in constant moon which would be nice all of which would be nice

28:36.700 --> 28:42.180
are there any uh contemporary science fiction writers that that you particularly admire or

28:42.180 --> 28:48.480
consider good writers yes agreed many and in particular you'd like to mention sure there's

28:48.480 --> 29:00.400
little glinn john varley pool angerson uh jerry pornell uh how far do we go with this I like the

29:00.400 --> 29:07.100
old ones and I like the new ones I like about half of uh following elizabeth's stories

29:09.200 --> 29:19.780
which is a better record than many writers have I like a few of phil dick stories and I will probably

29:19.780 --> 29:28.180
buy the uh last of the door side books by gordy dixon in fact it's damn certain I will read it I'll buy

29:28.180 --> 29:35.540
it if it doesn't come free I get swamped in free books you know uh

29:37.240 --> 29:44.520
I'm a period anthony fan I don't know how numerous we period anthony fans are I like the puzzles in

29:44.520 --> 29:52.480
his books and his books are always jammed with puzzles and new ways of thinking and so forth

29:55.840 --> 30:03.260
yeah it's a spell for chameleon stuff is great too love that um that really runs about the gamut of

30:03.260 --> 30:09.620
my questions here uh well one last question I ask you uh I don't suppose those uh puppeteers ever

30:09.620 --> 30:15.680
sneaked you the formula for that general products sold did they no I don't have the formula for

30:15.680 --> 30:20.820
general products though but I I have reason to suspect that there are puppeteers on earth

30:22.940 --> 30:28.700
look at the characteristics uh forget the shape they must be masters of biology that to hide that

30:28.700 --> 30:34.220
peculiar three-legged two-headed shape but consider their characteristics they are cowards

30:35.680 --> 30:42.120
that is they want everything utterly safe no corners on anything everything is soft surfaces

30:42.120 --> 30:48.960
around the puppeteer world they don't even keep their world near a sun regarding it as a runaway

30:49.840 --> 30:57.220
fusion reactor which of course it is so uh desperate regard for safety they uh plus

30:57.220 --> 31:06.860
an urge to meddle in the lifestyles of other species driving urge to meddle with with uh

31:06.860 --> 31:13.200
practically no restraints attached what does that remind you of it seems nearly certain to me that

31:13.200 --> 31:22.560
Ralph Nader is a fierceness puppeteer that's great is there anything uh anything else that you might

31:22.560 --> 31:28.140
have that you'd like to say to some of our radio listeners here that uh would be interested in

31:28.140 --> 31:28.620
fiction

31:50.860 --> 31:57.500
yeah it's uh been a real pleasure speaking with you tonight I appreciate very much your time

31:58.140 --> 32:01.280
on this. That's okay, I love talking about myself.

32:01.960 --> 32:06.740
I get a lot of radars left. Well we appreciate it. We enjoy hearing you talk too

32:08.460 --> 32:12.000
and thank you again for your time. We'll try to get a copy of this

32:12.000 --> 32:14.240
tape to you as soon as we can get it edited around.

32:17.160 --> 32:21.620
Hello. Okay thank you very much. That's me on this side. Okay you're cutting this out.

32:21.820 --> 32:24.620
Okay go ahead. I'll take it on this side. There we go.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.920
I haven't heard yet. Yeah I just...

32:27.920 --> 32:30.320
Now I've got it on here. Go ahead and hang up, both. Okay, go ahead.

32:32.600 --> 32:37.160
I got it. Mr. Niven, this is David Carson again. Could I ask you one question?

32:39.080 --> 32:41.700
Mr. Niven? Hello?

33:05.200 --> 33:10.320
Mr. Niven, we lost you on the phone there. This is David Carson at the Science Fiction

33:10.320 --> 33:15.120
Radio Show again. I was just calling to see if you still had time to talk with our

33:15.120 --> 33:21.240
sci-fi class this Thursday, November the 6th.

33:21.240 --> 33:26.120
Just a second. If you've asked me before, I probably noted it down.

33:26.380 --> 33:31.000
No, I haven't noted it down. That space is clear. What time do you want?

33:31.260 --> 33:35.560
We'll call you almost the same time, about five minutes, about 15 minutes

33:35.560 --> 33:41.300
after five year time. The class starts at seven o'clock our time, so that

33:41.300 --> 33:45.840
should be perfect. It'll be five fifteen year time.

33:48.320 --> 33:51.020
Okay. Listen, we certainly do appreciate this and

33:52.040 --> 33:55.200
we'll be sending you a copy of the completed tape and we'll be putting one

33:55.200 --> 33:57.320
on file with the Science Fiction Research Association.

33:58.660 --> 34:04.880
Okay, good. Yeah, we just joined up with them about a week or two ago and

34:05.680 --> 34:08.580
they sent us a little request and went all of our tapes, so we decided we'd

34:08.580 --> 34:10.840
send them some non-broadcast copies of the tapes to them.

34:11.740 --> 34:12.680
Good enough.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.740
Uh, excuse me, that was Thursday the 6th of November?

34:19.020 --> 34:25.300
Yes, sir. Good. I have this nasty habit of putting it down on the wrong day.

34:26.120 --> 34:33.880
Yeah. Okay. Okay, the class has about, depending upon how alert they are,

34:33.920 --> 34:38.640
they'll be between 10 to 20 people there and we won't take up more than about

34:38.640 --> 34:42.920
30 minutes of your time. Okay. They're reading your novel

34:42.920 --> 34:46.620
Ringworld for part of the class and that's what they'll be asking you

34:46.620 --> 34:51.360
questions on. Okay. There are mostly, they're just

34:51.360 --> 34:54.140
some average readers, they read a lot of stuff and there are a few

34:54.140 --> 34:57.900
ardent science fiction fans who will try and restrain.

34:58.780 --> 34:59.560
Okay.
