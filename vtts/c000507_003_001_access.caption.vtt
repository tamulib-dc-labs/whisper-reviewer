Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.240
And here are your hosts.

00:43.380 --> 00:51.840
This is David Cruz and Bill Vernon. Practicing physicist Robert L. Forward is
also a science fiction writer. After writing science fact articles in the

00:51.840 --> 00:59.640
magazines for almost 20 years, Forward recently published his first science
fiction novel, Dragon's Egg. When we asked Forward how he began writing science

00:59.640 --> 01:09.420
fiction, he claimed he was tricked into doing it. But the way I got into
actually writing fiction was Larry Niven tricked me. Here he explains how he

01:09.420 --> 01:20.920
innocently offered to help Larry Niven. Larry Niven and Jerry Pornell were
running a lecture series at UCLA, invited me to come and give a scientific talk

01:20.920 --> 01:35.200
on gravity as part of their series. It was how science fiction and science
interact. And at the close of one of the sessions that Larry was talking on, he

01:35.200 --> 01:46.580
said he wanted to write a story about beings that lived on a neutron star. Frank
Drake had mentioned this idea a number of years before. He said he really wanted

01:46.580 --> 01:54.020
to write that story. And that night at the cocktail party that they threw, I
said, Larry, I'll tell you what I'll do. I will work up all the scientific

01:54.020 --> 02:03.900
details behind the story because I know a lot about neutron star physics. And it
would be a fun story to read, and I'd like to read hard science fiction. And

02:03.900 --> 02:12.600
what I'd like to do is give you enough facts so that you can write a really hard
science fiction story without too many errors in it. When Ford finished his

02:12.600 --> 02:21.820
part, Niven was still busy, so Ford continued the work himself. And so I worked
up all the science and gave him about 25, 30 pages of notes. And he said, gee,

02:22.000 --> 02:32.440
I'm busy right now working with Jerry Pornell on something called Lucifer's
Hammer. And I'm pretty busy. I'll tell you what we'll do. Why don't we just sort

02:32.440 --> 02:43.620
of make this a collaboration. You write the first draft of the story. And then
I'll take it over from there and rewrite the thing because you're not a writer,

02:43.640 --> 02:52.480
and I am. And that way we'll get the best of both worlds. Well, so I went back
and wrote the first draft. And when I came back, he was still busy. And so I

02:52.480 --> 03:02.480
ended up finding out that I wanted to read this story. And the only way I could
read that story was to write it first. So I had to write it. And so Larry Niven

03:02.480 --> 03:04.320
tricked me into getting into science fiction.

03:14.640 --> 03:23.560
But Larry Niven didn't abandon Ford after tricking him into writing a novel. He
advised Ford on many aspects, including a major plot element. Larry Niven

03:23.560 --> 03:32.580
basically gave the thousand to one, I mean, excuse me, the million to one time
difference.

03:35.780 --> 03:47.320
And the main thing that he brought out was the fact that the important part of
the story was not all the science, which would have been my tendency to write,

03:47.320 --> 04:04.320
but the problems of how do you communicate with somebody that lives and dies a
million times faster than you do. And if those beings, since they would be

04:04.320 --> 04:13.920
thinking a million times faster than you, would figure out that you were there
long before you could figure out they were there, and they had to figure out a

04:13.920 --> 04:26.660
way to communicate with you and signal you that they were there before you left.
And so he mentioned the fact that, for instance, somebody on the neutron star

04:26.660 --> 04:39.180
would have to climb a mountain and send a signal. And that might take them many
generations. Actually, in the story, I compressed it into one generation,

04:39.340 --> 04:50.680
basically. But that was the kind of attitude that he brought toward the story
that helped a lot. More on Robert Ford tomorrow.

The Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:51.860 --> 05:55.780
coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:11.460 --> 06:16.800
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.140
And here are your hosts.

06:25.280 --> 06:32.800
This is Bill Vernon. And David Cruz. In our last show, we learned how Robert
Ford was tricked into writing the manuscript, which evolved into his novel,

06:32.960 --> 06:42.800
Dragon's Egg. Larry Niven helped Ford flesh out his ideas, but it was Lester Del
Rey who helped him polish the manuscript into a novel. My very first draft, of

06:42.800 --> 07:01.280
course, was quite rough from a writing point of view. And when Lester looked at
it, he saw some potential in it, but as it was, as the manuscript was sent to

07:01.280 --> 07:19.800
him, it wasn't acceptable. It wasn't the book. And he sat down and typed up 14
pages, single space of detailed criticism of the manuscript. And those 14 pages,

07:20.040 --> 07:32.000
when I followed them to the letter, and I don't think I disagreed with him on
but, say, one or two things, when I went back through the manuscript and took

07:32.000 --> 07:47.160
his suggestions and then looked at the resultants, it was, you know, it began to
be readable instead of being a, well, a science fact article, I guess. You know,

07:47.220 --> 07:49.560
it had some flow. It had some characterization.

07:52.360 --> 08:01.760
But, you know, it still was a hard science fiction novel. In Dragon's Egg, Ford
takes a hard science approach to a situation in which beings who inhabit a

08:01.760 --> 08:09.540
neutron star learn of the humans who are orbiting their star, then establish
communications with them. The task is made difficult, though, by the fact that

08:09.540 --> 08:18.140
the aliens live at a pace roughly a million times faster than that of humans.
Thus, an individual alien, or chela, lives out its entire life in several human

08:18.140 --> 08:26.720
minutes. The chela, being native to a neutron star, with its intense
gravitational and magnetic fields and extremely dense matter, are certainly

08:26.720 --> 08:39.180
constructed different from humans. Here, Ford tells us about the aliens, their
environment, and their names. Once I had placed my imagination and myself on the

08:39.180 --> 08:53.420
surface of the neutron star, now, once I knew the territory well enough and
appreciated the fact that the light on this star comes from below, not above, so

08:53.420 --> 09:05.120
if the sky is black, there's no light coming out of it except the two stars,
everything is aglow from below, and the territory is very flat because of the

09:05.120 --> 09:25.200
terrific gravity, I began to sort of appreciate what it was like there. And what
I basically did was take the Indian technique of naming children about things

09:25.200 --> 09:37.240
that occurred shortly after they were born and applied it to the chela, but put
in a hyphen, so it would take out the Indian context, and also, of course, a lot

09:37.240 --> 09:49.760
of the Indian things like eagles and feathers and sky and things like that don't
exist, so I had to do that transfer. The chela's social structure differs from

09:49.760 --> 10:00.540
ours as well, though there are some similarities. Soon I began to realize that
in my dreaming up of these creatures, I had ended up with a social structure

10:00.540 --> 10:15.780
that was sort of halfway between a Scottish clan and an Indian tribe, and as if
both the Indians and the Scottish were crocodiles that laid eggs instead of

10:15.780 --> 10:26.440
having the problems of mammals that they have to take care of their young. The
young are immediately viable in crocodiles and turtles, and so are the little

10:26.440 --> 10:40.680
tiny chela. So what I tried to do was imagine what it would be like if instead
of monkeys developing intelligent social interactions, crocodiles developed

10:40.680 --> 10:42.680
intelligent social interactions.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.920
Modesto Returnæ¢µ

11:25.520 --> 11:28.320
and in partnership with I been involved in

11:37.880 --> 11:41.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:57.500 --> 12:02.840
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.180
And here are your hosts.

12:11.320 --> 12:20.300
This is David Cruz and Bill Vernon. Although science fiction is a literature
ostensibly about science, the effects of technology, or a future where science

12:20.300 --> 12:29.460
is very much present, or in some cases very much absent, it is mainly written by
non-scientists. Some writers do have undergraduate degrees in the sciences. Paul

12:29.460 --> 12:37.780
Anderson, Arthur C. Clarke, Joe Haldeman, and Charles Harness, to name a few.
And certainly most other writers have had some coursework in the sciences. But

12:37.780 --> 12:46.460
there are a few scientists who write science fiction. Practicing scientists who
write it include Gregory Benford, Joan Slanzuski, Fred Hoyle, David Brin, and

12:46.460 --> 12:54.640
Tony Rothman, and a notable ex-scientist, Isaac Asimov. Another practicing
scientist who writes science fiction is physicist Robert Ford, whose novel

12:54.640 --> 13:04.920
Dragon's Egg we have discussed previously. We asked Ford what enjoyment he reaps
from being a scientist and writing science fiction. Writing is a process of

13:04.920 --> 13:16.680
selling science. I mean, I have always felt that part of my job as a scientist
was to try and communicate, first, the facts of science, and second, the

13:16.680 --> 13:30.440
excitement of science, science, to the general public that is not involved in
science. Because science is at the cutting edge of our intellectual

13:30.440 --> 13:42.820
achievements, whether it's physical sciences, chemical sciences, biological or
social or whatever sciences. This is where we're developing as an intelligent

13:42.820 --> 13:56.880
being. And we're learning more about the world around us and how we operate in
that world. And it's very exciting to be involved in that. And you don't get

13:56.880 --> 14:06.400
many scientists admitting that it's exciting, but it is. I mean, it's part of
the reasons you get professors working at wages less than they would if they

14:06.400 --> 14:16.060
were a plumber, is it's more fun to be a scientist. But most of them are so
hidebound and so concerned about their image that they don't want to admit that

14:16.060 --> 14:26.920
they're having fun. Well, I admit I'm having fun being a scientist. And I think
it's fun. I think that fun and the excitement and everything else can be

14:26.920 --> 14:38.340
communicated to the general public so that their awareness of the fact that
they're part of an intellectual and evolutionary advance as an intelligent being

14:38.340 --> 14:53.280
can be given to them. And I think that's one of the reasons why we have such a
spurt of magazines today like Omni and Science 80 and the Smithsonian and others

14:53.280 --> 15:08.820
that have, and Discovery. All of these magazines are beginning to realize that
people want to be part of the leading edge of our cultural evolution. And I

15:08.820 --> 15:23.260
found that I have the ability to communicate that. Now, for many years, I would
only write science articles, not fiction. I wouldn't have a story. I'd just say,

15:23.340 --> 15:31.480
here's something interesting I found at the outskirts of science, and isn't it
wonderful and isn't it great? And I'd write it down to whatever level was there.

15:32.140 --> 15:42.040
And those were science speculation articles that I've sold in Analog and Omni
and places like that. And I'm finding that doing it in the form of fiction

15:42.040 --> 15:43.560
reaches more people.

16:01.620 --> 16:09.000
Although Ford is becoming better known in the science fiction community because
of Dragon's Egg, he has been in the field for many years writing science fact

16:09.000 --> 16:16.540
articles for the science fiction magazines. Certainly, science fiction benefits
when people with not only the scientific background, but the enthusiasm of

16:16.540 --> 16:18.260
Robert Ford contribute to it.

16:25.360 --> 16:33.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:33.240 --> 16:34.000
Odessa, Texas.

16:37.940 --> 16:39.140
Thank you.

17:14.740 --> 17:18.640
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:34.540 --> 17:39.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.040
And here are your hosts.

17:48.280 --> 17:56.020
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. One of the most unique of all science
fiction novels is Norman Spinrad's The Iron Dream. Though Spinrad did indeed

17:56.020 --> 18:04.420
write the book, he presents it as if it were written by Adolf Hitler. Spinrad
bases the book on a provocative supposition. Suppose Hitler, instead of leading

18:04.420 --> 18:11.580
the Nazi party to power in Germany, had come to this country and become a
science fiction writer. What kind of books would he have written? The Iron Dream

18:11.580 --> 18:19.920
is Spinrad's answer to that question. He wrote the book exactly as he believes
Hitler would have. Spinrad says it was a difficult book to write. Because in

18:19.920 --> 18:28.340
order to write that book, I had to write like Hitler. And in order to get to
that point, I had to read everything that Hitler had written, which is very

18:28.340 --> 18:36.060
boring indeed. And I had to also write a book called Hitler's Dinner
Conversations. It was like 800 pages of Hitler's babblings at the dinner table,

18:36.180 --> 18:44.100
which was taken out of short end by Martin Borman, a fascinating book. But in
order to write the bulk of that book, Hitler's novel inside the book, I had to

18:44.100 --> 18:55.660
write like Hitler. I had to get inside Hitler's head. That was not what I could
consider a fun experience. And so it was a very difficult book to write. Kind of

18:55.660 --> 19:05.260
a shattering book to write because of the kind of position I put myself in.
Also, of course, Hitler was a terrible writer. So in order to be accurate, I

19:05.260 --> 19:13.160
really had to write something awful in a way. And I was trying to, you know...
Also, Hitler was getting crazier and crazier as he was writing the book. So I

19:13.160 --> 19:15.100
got crazier and crazier as I was writing the book.

19:25.340 --> 19:33.320
Hitler's main character is Farrick Jagger, a sword and sorcery type hero. Jagger
fights to preserve the racial purity of humanity against hordes of genetically

19:33.320 --> 19:41.100
inferior mutants. And in every way, Spinrad tries to create a novel a pulp
science fiction writer with Hitler's political and racial views and writing

19:41.100 --> 19:48.400
skills would have produced. The book, of course, is a classic anti-fascist
novel. We asked Spinrad if anyone had ever completely misunderstood it and

19:48.400 --> 19:57.660
thought he was admiring Hitler. No, the only kind of misunderstanding that I
read in a review that I really got was a little bit different. It was somebody

19:57.660 --> 20:04.460
who said, well, this is really all good fun, you know, I really enjoyed this
book. Why did he have to muck it up with all this stuff about Hitler and all the

20:04.460 --> 20:13.440
extraneous paraphernalia? It was just a good, you know, rousing adventure tale.
That is the only kind of misreading of the book that's really taken place.

20:13.960 --> 20:20.200
Actually, I have not been called a Nazi or a fascist by anyone that I know of in
connection with that book.

20:28.720 --> 20:36.720
Spinrad explains where the idea for such a unique experiment came from. Well,
the impetus came from a conversation with Mike Wilcock in London where I was

20:36.720 --> 20:50.520
living at the time about how he wrote Sword and Sorcery and how he used Freudian
imagery and, you know, the basic appeal of Sword and Sorcery and that gave me

20:50.520 --> 21:03.260
the idea that if Hitler had not, you know, become Fuhrer of Germany, he could
have as well winded up writing Sword and Sorcery. And I've always been, you

21:03.260 --> 21:11.860
know, fascinated with the whole question of how a thing like Nazism could really
happen. And none of the stuff I had read about that really satisfied me, you

21:11.860 --> 21:20.720
know, political or economic or conventional explanations of how this happened.
And the two things came together and, you know, my insight about Nazism was that

21:20.720 --> 21:31.880
it was a psychosexual phenomenon and that Hitler came to power by, in effect,
manipulating imagery and psychosexual substructures rather than by a coherent

21:31.880 --> 21:39.440
economic program and so forth. And so that was the basic, and then, you know,
this had a certain correlation with a certain kind of sword and sorcery and that

21:39.440 --> 21:49.360
was the basic impetus that generated the book. The Iron Dream was published in
1972. It won the pre-Apollo Award in France and was recently reissued in this

21:49.360 --> 21:56.020
country by Timescape Books. And when it was first published in Germany not too
long ago, it was banned. We'll have that story next time.

22:03.200 --> 22:11.060
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:11.060 --> 22:11.820
Odessa, Texas.

22:33.580 --> 22:41.520
The Iron Dream is

22:41.520 --> 22:57.600
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, of the

22:57.600 --> 22:58.920
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

23:16.020 --> 23:21.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.660
And here are your hosts.

23:29.660 --> 23:38.560
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Early in 1982, Norman Spinrad's science
fiction novel, The Iron Dream, was totally banned in Germany. As we explained

23:38.560 --> 23:45.660
last time, the book is an anti-fascist novel. Though Spinrad pretends the book
was written by Adolf Hitler, it is actually a brilliant criticism of the

23:45.660 --> 23:53.260
political and racial views held by Hitler. Spinrad says the book has been well
received in all the countries where it's been published. This book has been

23:53.260 --> 24:11.080
published now in the United States, Britain, France, Japan, Spain, Portugal,
Argentina, Italy, I forget where else, about eight different countries. It's

24:11.080 --> 24:24.460
been published in the other two Axis powers. It's been published in Argentina.
And it's been extensively reviewed in about eight different countries. I have no

24:24.460 --> 24:31.480
instance where the book was misunderstood and was taken as anything but an anti
-Nazi and anti-fascist novel

24:34.200 --> 24:42.680
throughout the world. The German censors cited the book's danger to young people
as one reason it was banned. We asked Spinrad if anyone could possibly

24:42.680 --> 24:53.720
misunderstand his intentions in The Iron Dream. Well, any, I mean, you know, you
know, you know, you know, Hinkley certainly misunderstood saying taxi drivers,

24:53.740 --> 25:01.200
so there's always schizophrenics and maniacs around who can misunderstand
anything. I mean, you know, David Horowitz heard demons in his head. I mean,

25:01.260 --> 25:09.380
there are always completely crazy people who can read things out of something
that were never in there. So I'd be one or two people around, you know,

25:10.200 --> 25:18.860
psychotics who could get anything out of any book. But I don't, I, see, the book
is written on two levels. The sophisticated readers, they understand what it is

25:18.860 --> 25:30.120
to begin with. But the other level is that the kind of people who are into
things like Perry Rodin and that kind of proto-fascist science fantasy would

25:30.120 --> 25:37.420
start off reading the book, maybe identifying with Ferrick Jagger, you know, a
third of the way into it or something, and suddenly realizing what it is they're

25:37.420 --> 25:45.120
identifying with. And so it becomes a kind of deprogramming experience for the
kind of people that they claim would be harmed. I think it would be a very

25:45.120 --> 25:54.440
strongly anti-Nazi book precisely for those kinds of young people who might have
leanings in that direction because they would then be confronted with what it is

25:54.440 --> 26:04.840
that they're really identifying with. We also asked Spinrad what his reaction to
the ban was. My reaction to the ban is very complicated. First of all, it took

26:04.840 --> 26:13.920
ten years to get this book published in Germany. All my French friends said it
would never be published in Germany. So when Heine Berlach, you know, summoned

26:13.920 --> 26:20.900
up the courage to publish it, I was very pleased, and I thought that this was
going to, you know, that this represented a kind of maturity on the part of

26:20.900 --> 26:28.360
Germany, that they're willing to look at this stuff. And I felt very good about
it being published there, and I was a bit surprised. Now that it's banned,

26:28.640 --> 26:39.580
obviously I feel that, well, the book says it all. The book itself, in a way, is
about why it was banned, because it's the same sort of mentality that goes

26:39.580 --> 26:50.520
around banning books that resulted in a different kind of way, in the Third
Reich. That's not to say that all Germans are like this, because the publisher

26:50.520 --> 26:58.780
has fought this all the way and is continuing to fight it. Most of the German
newspapers, there's been a lot of coverage, has supported the book against the

26:58.780 --> 27:08.640
ban. The German chapter of World SF had a vote and issued a public statement
against the ban in supporting the book.

27:11.400 --> 27:19.160

27:19.160 --> 27:27.480

Constitution of the United States. And it's a particularly pernicious law,

27:27.940 --> 27:36.480
because anything can be banned under this law under the grounds that it's not
fit for children, even if it's not intended for children, which is exactly the

27:36.480 --> 27:42.760
