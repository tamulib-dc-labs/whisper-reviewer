00:01.380 --> 00:02.540
Okay, we've got the tape rolling.

00:03.260 --> 00:05.380
Okay, I have just one more question on the immortals.

00:06.400 --> 00:12.200
As you were noting, the TV series concentrated on the idea of the chase, but the book had

00:12.200 --> 00:13.200
a totally different...

00:13.920 --> 00:15.560
Well, it wasn't a chase in the novel.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.020
You had some other ideas, I think, about medicine and so forth.

00:18.780 --> 00:19.860
Could you just...

00:19.860 --> 00:23.040
Well, my concern was not particularly...

00:23.040 --> 00:31.500
Well, certainly the notion of the search for the immortal, the person that I call Cartwright,

00:32.800 --> 00:37.440
Marshall Cartwright, was in there to provide a core of interest.

00:38.160 --> 00:46.400
But I was primarily interested in the novel on the impact of the possibility of immortality

00:46.400 --> 00:55.680
on society itself, and interested in dealing with those kinds of impulses that people have

00:56.520 --> 00:59.060
relating to immortality and longevity.

01:00.340 --> 01:07.540
And in a certain sense, the immortals embodies as well as anything else that I've written,

01:08.240 --> 01:16.780
my basic philosophical position in my work that can be traced through almost all of it,

01:16.800 --> 01:22.040
I suspect, that there are no real villains in life.

01:23.720 --> 01:30.700
There are only people who want the same things everybody else wants, but who are willing

01:30.700 --> 01:34.460
to do to get them things that other people are not willing to do.

01:35.420 --> 01:48.140
And that the best things in life can be wanted too much, that if anything that is considered good

01:48.820 --> 01:50.680
can be an evil.

01:50.960 --> 01:58.080
And I suppose one of the basic concepts with which I began the immortals was the concept that

01:59.160 --> 02:02.460
everybody thinks it would be wonderful to live forever.

02:03.300 --> 02:11.400
But what if you had a man who accidentally could live forever, but who also whose blood

02:11.400 --> 02:16.300
could rejuvenate other people, and his life would be made miserable?

02:17.300 --> 02:27.940
And from there, of course, the entire extrapolation about the ways in which society, knowing the

02:27.940 --> 02:37.920
possibility of immortality would force people, would force society to pour more and more

02:37.920 --> 02:49.780
and more money into medicine until the law of diminishing returns would mean that half

02:49.780 --> 02:56.380
of the world would be devoted to medicine and everybody else would be starving in the slum.

02:58.620 --> 02:59.460
Okay, fine.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.280
Let me skip forward to one of your more recent books.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.620
I think the hardback edition was called The Dreamers.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.820
The hardback edition is called The Mindmaster.

03:09.160 --> 03:09.320
Right.

03:11.040 --> 03:15.720
I guess the scientific basis or the thing that you're working with in that book is chemical

03:15.720 --> 03:16.140
memory.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.720
Could you explain the scientific basis for that?

03:18.720 --> 03:19.740
Yes.

03:21.080 --> 03:29.260
As long ago as a quarter of a century ago, experiments began at various places and were

03:29.260 --> 03:37.600
continued at the University of Michigan by a man named McConnell with a simple kind of

03:37.600 --> 03:46.500
life called planarian worms and in other places with rats and even chickens and other kinds

03:47.280 --> 03:49.780
of vertebrate life.

03:50.940 --> 04:00.300
And some of the experiments that they did seemed to indicate that memory can be transmitted

04:00.300 --> 04:01.120
chemically.

04:01.860 --> 04:10.380
Some of the worms, for instance, where they learned to go to travel through simple mazes

04:11.000 --> 04:14.700
would be chopped up and fed to the other worms and they seemed to learn how to go through

04:14.700 --> 04:15.520
the mazes quicker.

04:16.820 --> 04:24.160
Similarly, some of the rats that they train who normally prefer dark places and fear light

04:24.940 --> 04:29.900
could be trained by electric shocks to do just the opposite, to prefer white places and

04:29.900 --> 04:36.180
fear going into dark places and then they would make an extract of their brains and

04:36.180 --> 04:41.300
injected the other rats and they seemed to exhibit the same kind of behavior as if it

04:41.300 --> 04:47.300
had been injected in them from the other rats and many experiments have actually gone

04:47.300 --> 04:49.180
on in this area.

04:49.360 --> 04:54.120
Now, not everybody, all biologists do not believe that this is true.

04:54.920 --> 05:00.300
They don't believe in the evidence and think it can be explained in other ways but at least

05:00.300 --> 05:04.680
there is a solid body of scientific evidence which suggests that maybe there's something

05:04.680 --> 05:10.920
going on there and I took this, these possibilities and asked myself what would happen.

05:10.920 --> 05:21.360
If it really were perfected, if one could encode information into molecules, protein

05:21.360 --> 05:30.780
molecules, they seemed to think it probably used messenger RNA perhaps and this information

05:30.780 --> 05:39.740
could be injected to other people so that they would not have to study it or learn about

05:39.740 --> 05:46.900
it in class, they would have the information from an injection and then beyond that I sort

05:46.900 --> 05:53.740
of used that notion peripherally in my novel campus and then beyond that when I took up

05:53.740 --> 06:02.700
the dreamers I based an entire world on the notion that people would want to go beyond

06:02.700 --> 06:09.980
the knowledge to experience and they would live lives which were basically injections

06:09.980 --> 06:16.200
of other people's experiences which they would be able to obtain in the form of injections.

06:18.560 --> 06:22.580
Well now the mnemonist in that story, I think that's the way it would be pronounced.

06:23.840 --> 06:29.060
You describe him as a decision maker and sort of a memory machine but I still had a few

06:29.060 --> 06:33.520
little vague spots about what actually his function was or what he did.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.280
Could you just explain that briefly?

06:35.920 --> 06:42.040
Well my feeling was and of course being the mnemonist there are four sections which really

06:42.040 --> 06:49.640
serve as a frame for three other major dramatic episodes each of which is a kind of love story

06:50.680 --> 06:58.800
and I really embedded him in order to sort of link the other three together in more than

06:58.800 --> 07:03.540
simply a subject or location way.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.600
Nevertheless he does function I think in the book and rather interestingly.

07:11.020 --> 07:25.180
But I felt that a world like this which primarily exists because of computers and machine operations

07:26.420 --> 07:34.480
might be able to continue for a while without human intervention but that inevitably some

07:34.480 --> 07:40.440
kinds of imperfections would creep in and that it could not over the long run continue

07:40.440 --> 07:41.320
to exist.

07:41.920 --> 07:50.000
And I felt the need of that there would be a need for someone like the mnemonist to exercise

07:50.000 --> 07:59.480
a basic kind of unifying control over the machines to keep them to make the decisions

08:00.030 --> 08:05.860
that needed to be made which were outside perhaps of the range of decision making that

08:05.860 --> 08:06.880
the computers would have.

08:07.770 --> 08:18.440
And his need at the point when the story begins is that he recognizes that his body, his physical

08:18.440 --> 08:25.620
body, his deteriorating after many many years is being sort of part of the flow of information

08:26.720 --> 08:35.580
and that he needs to find his successor if this world is going to continue and his exploration

08:35.580 --> 08:42.480
of the lives of these three people in the predict episodes is part of his effort to

08:42.480 --> 08:43.440
find that successor.

08:46.020 --> 08:51.200
But at the end of that book if I read it correctly or if I remember it correctly the mnemonist

08:51.200 --> 08:54.980
doesn't seem to be able to find a replacement he sort of is getting tired of what he's

08:54.980 --> 08:58.780
doing he's yearning for an end to everything.

08:59.260 --> 09:04.200
Of course he also is dying he recognizes the fact that he's dying which is what tells him

09:04.200 --> 09:12.060
to seek a replacement and each replacement that he samples falls short in one way or

09:12.060 --> 09:21.440
another does not have the kind of dedication to information that he has and ultimately

09:21.440 --> 09:34.460
all of them fail and he himself at the end stops and trails off into nothing because

09:34.460 --> 09:41.920
he is dying that is and he also kind of longs for an end to this continual flow of information

09:43.920 --> 09:48.060
Well, could what I be wrong in reading the end of that book too as sort of a comment

09:48.060 --> 09:52.520
on the fact that this kind of lifestyle is dreaming is sort of a dead end existence.

09:52.980 --> 09:54.900
Yes, I think that's quite true.

09:55.380 --> 10:06.540
It is a comment on the fact that dreaming itself is a non-survival characteristic.

10:06.540 --> 10:13.040
It may be well the most it may be the most satisfying ultimately the most satisfying

10:13.040 --> 10:18.900
experience but as perhaps I said in the joy makers is perhaps repeated here a different

10:18.900 --> 10:32.660
way that ultimate satisfaction or dreaming is a death activity and that survival demands

10:33.620 --> 10:36.660
something less than total satisfaction.

10:38.360 --> 10:48.400
It demands a certain kind of sacrifice of gratification for other goals and it demands

10:48.400 --> 10:56.000
a certain kind of dissatisfaction in a life I guess one might say is dissatisfaction.

10:58.600 --> 11:03.780
Yeah, one more comment or question on that book I being a literary person myself I'm

11:03.780 --> 11:09.360
always fascinated with the way you work in great literary classics or allusions in your

11:09.360 --> 11:09.560
work.

11:09.620 --> 11:16.540
That's a kind of weakness of mine I think I do like like epigraph and throughout my books

11:16.540 --> 11:19.760
I've sprinkled them perhaps more than most people are interested in.

11:21.020 --> 11:23.740
No, I think they're beautifully done.

11:23.980 --> 11:28.780
The listeners of course was sort of uses the poem the listeners in the background and then

11:29.880 --> 11:34.620
for instance with the mnemonist I think it was perfect to use say Tennyson's Lotus Eaters

11:34.620 --> 11:36.380
you know as an escape a dream.

11:37.080 --> 11:41.260
My question would be my particular one on that book the last episode the one with the

11:41.260 --> 11:47.440
dreamer when you sort of actually in a fascinating way retell a story of the Iliad.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.040
Yes.

11:48.500 --> 11:53.240
A lot of people haven't thought that was so great but I thought it was great.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.920
I'm glad you agree with me I really really enjoyed doing that one.

11:57.500 --> 12:01.380
No, that was fascinating I'm gonna I have been trying to find ways I could work that

12:01.380 --> 12:05.360
book into my my world literature class and have the kids read that instead of the real

12:05.360 --> 12:05.760
Iliad.

12:06.740 --> 12:14.360
Well I have one review from Texas I think some Texas newspaper that was sent to me who said

12:14.740 --> 12:21.020
you know he really betrays his lack of ability when he compares himself with Homer which

12:21.020 --> 12:24.000
one of what I was trying to do what I was really trying to do in lots of ways was to

12:25.060 --> 12:31.700
retell the Iliad from the viewpoint of the Trojans and from basically the viewpoint of

12:31.700 --> 12:44.260
Paris and to reinterpret the mythical elements as the mistaken notions of a dreamer that

12:44.260 --> 12:51.380
he actually is controlling this dream in the way that Homer said that God's controlled

12:51.380 --> 12:51.620
it.

12:53.640 --> 12:59.460
Oh yeah no it worked very well I've I think it gives you know just the whole idea of using

12:59.460 --> 13:04.740
some work of literature great work of literature within your own work is gives it a resonance

13:04.740 --> 13:07.180
or a depth that I think.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.860
I'm glad you feel that way.

13:08.860 --> 13:14.840
I certainly felt like that I thought it was really the most successful of the three stories

13:14.840 --> 13:17.880
but three episodes.

13:20.560 --> 13:27.380
One more question on that I have thought of the dreamer himself becomes so obsessed with

13:27.380 --> 13:32.020
the dream and his love for Helen that he you know stays in it and does away with everything

13:32.020 --> 13:37.040
else in his own life and obviously he's going to die at the end of it in the dream he's

13:37.040 --> 13:37.500
going to die.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.240
In fact there are premonitions yes.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.040
Okay now is he going to die in real life too?

13:42.460 --> 13:48.260
It's my feeling yes that he's become so you know he's cut himself off so much from the

13:48.260 --> 13:54.980
rest of existence and that he has become so identified it's so self-identified with Paris

13:55.520 --> 14:03.640
that he is going to when the arrow the poisoned arrow flies through the sky and strikes him

14:03.640 --> 14:08.540
in the eye and the wrist and so forth that that's going to kill him.

14:08.800 --> 14:16.780
Obviously Paris cannot survive if the Elliott and my feeling is although other people can

14:16.780 --> 14:21.920
argue with it was that Samuel the dreamer will die also at that moment.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.940
Now that was my impression I thought he would too.

14:25.440 --> 14:25.560
Yes.

14:26.440 --> 14:31.840
Listen on almost well much of your work not all of it but say the immortals the joy makers

14:31.840 --> 14:36.800
the listeners the dreamers and so forth this has been noted by I guess readers of yours

14:36.800 --> 14:42.000
but those books are set up as a sort of a series of novelettes or interrelated novelettes

14:42.000 --> 14:44.640
and I wondered why you picked that particular writing style.

14:45.860 --> 14:50.880
Well I might say that only about three or four of my books are not written that way

14:50.880 --> 14:56.520
my first two books were not campus is not it was written as a novel a kind of episodic

14:56.520 --> 15:07.460
novel and the magicians was not but this was a conscious decision back when I was freelance

15:07.460 --> 15:17.140
writing full time and I was trying to make a living at it and I wrote my first novel

15:17.140 --> 15:23.500
this Fortress World and it took me about three months which was needed particularly fast

15:23.500 --> 15:33.260
nor particularly slow but the way speed which I was writing other things and out of that

15:33.260 --> 15:37.860
I made a total of about five hundred dollars because it wasn't serialized anywhere just

15:37.860 --> 15:38.460
no.

15:39.800 --> 15:44.420
Since then it's made more than that but at the time only brought me that much money and

15:44.420 --> 15:50.200
I also wrote Starbridge in collaboration with Jack Williamson just about the same time and

15:50.200 --> 15:55.320
out of that I got half of five hundred dollars two hundred fifty dollars so I had a total

15:57.460 --> 16:01.940
return for six months of work with about seven hundred fifty dollars and I decided that wouldn't

16:01.940 --> 16:08.000
do you know I couldn't make a living that way and I also had the feeling as I expressed

16:08.000 --> 16:14.620
in my collection my scribe's collection Some Dreams of Nightmares I also had the feeling

16:14.620 --> 16:24.920
that really the ideal form for science fiction is not the novel but the novelette or the

16:24.920 --> 16:34.300
short novel because the novel demands a kind of solution to a major problem for which basically

16:34.300 --> 16:39.780
those solutions are possible if they were possible those problems that already be solved

16:40.660 --> 16:46.240
and also most novels, most science fiction novels tend to start at a very high level

16:46.240 --> 16:53.720
of intensity and kind of fall apart at the end. The intensity and interest is hard to

16:53.720 --> 16:59.740
sustain and when you try to wind it up it seems kind of flat whereas in the novelette

16:59.740 --> 17:05.940
you aren't required to resolve major problems only the particular problems within the novelette

17:05.940 --> 17:13.300
but you have length enough to establish a different world in which to operate. So at

17:13.300 --> 17:19.440
that time I decided that when I got a novel idea I would think of it in terms of novelettes

17:19.440 --> 17:24.720
which I get published in the magazines and then bring together in the form of books and

17:24.720 --> 17:32.660
thus get paid twice for it and out of that came my what since become known as guns law

17:33.140 --> 17:40.420
among the students in my institute which is nothing is worth writing unless you can

17:40.420 --> 17:48.800
sell it at least twice and as a consequence I have since that time mostly written by novels

17:48.800 --> 17:58.540
in the form of publishable fragments or individual stories and in a way I think it's worked rather

17:58.540 --> 18:07.740
well because in the joy makers I was able to use as a framework as a subject matter

18:07.740 --> 18:15.980
really an idea rather than a person or a group of people and so this novel which extended

18:15.980 --> 18:22.420
over about 200 years picked up several different people but basically was about one thing science

18:22.420 --> 18:29.260
of happiness and similarly the immortals which also continued for about 200 years and the

18:29.260 --> 18:40.560
listeners which took a cover about 150 years and all of these seemed to me to focus on

18:40.560 --> 18:47.500
an idea which is what science fiction mostly does and deals historically or in the future

18:47.500 --> 18:54.870
history way with its development without feeling compelled to carry any character through entirely

18:55.300 --> 18:59.360
in a way which might be difficult to achieve legitimately.

19:01.780 --> 19:06.040
Yeah okay guns law is a little bit disillusioning to me.

19:06.500 --> 19:14.040
Well I would say that it's not completely commercial and as a matter of fact it seems

19:14.040 --> 19:20.200
to me to apply to other kinds of endeavor that is that there are an awful lot of things

19:20.200 --> 19:27.980
that people can put their hands to ways to spend their time to spend their creative and

19:27.980 --> 19:32.420
intellectual energies and you have to be able to judge between these.

19:33.360 --> 19:39.700
How are you going to spend your time particularly in terms of a writer he has so many ideas

19:39.700 --> 19:44.920
that he's never going to be able to deal with them all in his lifetime and so he has to

19:44.920 --> 19:50.480
be able to choose between them and it seems to me guns law says think about those which

19:50.480 --> 19:58.680
are most productive which have the most substance to them and they are the ones that you ought

19:58.680 --> 19:59.500
to focus on.

20:00.340 --> 20:07.500
Not simply craftslayer the money they might bring in but the audiences to which they might

20:07.500 --> 20:08.560
have something to say.

20:09.920 --> 20:13.380
Well I understand that I was being facetious when I said that but the reason I brought

20:13.380 --> 20:18.960
it up we interviewed Jack Vance and I asked him what he would like to be remembered for

20:18.960 --> 20:23.260
or as you know when he finishes the body of his work and he said I would like to be remembered

20:23.260 --> 20:24.880
as a very rich science fiction writer.

20:25.660 --> 20:31.380
Yeah well I've given up that notion you know I think I realize I'm never going to be rich

20:31.940 --> 20:42.280
unless the listeners which is now under option to a television studio has turned into a long

20:42.280 --> 20:49.760
running television series which I doubt or some other one of my books has picked up and

20:49.760 --> 20:51.260
made into a gigantic movie.

20:52.200 --> 20:57.720
I'm going to have to be satisfied doing what I'm doing and it's really worked out pretty

20:57.720 --> 20:58.040
well.

20:58.840 --> 21:04.780
Well I would have said that almost any work that you've written it's so strong in terms

21:04.780 --> 21:09.960
of the idea behind it that any one of those would make beautiful series or movies I can't

21:09.960 --> 21:11.500
understand why they haven't even picked up more.

21:11.920 --> 21:16.780
Well there have been you know the listeners was picked up before and some of my other

21:16.780 --> 21:23.780
stories have been picked up and I think one of the reasons why in a sense some of the

21:23.780 --> 21:29.720
television motion picture companies have been interested is because of my experience in

21:29.720 --> 21:40.260
play writing my work tends to be pretty visual and to occur in the form of scenes which can

21:40.260 --> 21:47.620
be visualized as taking place and I think that visual quality as well as the idea behind

21:47.620 --> 21:55.920
it is appealing and I think for another aspect of it I've always felt that each book was

21:55.920 --> 22:07.200
a different task and I approached each not as any sequel to anything but as an individual

22:07.880 --> 22:17.600
problem in writing and did them all individually and never as far as I can remember ever having

22:17.620 --> 22:22.940
written anything strictly for money it was always because I wanted to write it.

22:23.980 --> 22:28.620
No I would have suspected that. Listen I have more material but this is taking a great deal

22:28.620 --> 22:29.760
of your time I'm sure.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.420
Well I'm going to go on as long as you are.

22:32.780 --> 22:38.180
Well I don't that might be a little that might take too much time but if you're still okay

22:38.180 --> 22:39.080
I do have some more.

22:39.240 --> 22:39.680
Okay go ahead.

22:39.720 --> 22:47.600
I just wanted to check with you. Okay let's see let me just skip to all of the questions

22:47.620 --> 22:51.880
a whole new area I did have some more questions about your work but let me go ahead to a different

22:51.880 --> 22:52.540
kind of area.

22:57.420 --> 23:04.180
Oh let's see what about some of your short stories.

23:06.440 --> 23:10.740
Let me make this kind of two questions I guess I was going to ask you a question about fantasy

23:10.740 --> 23:15.160
just sort of in general how you differentiate it from science fiction and why you don't write

23:15.160 --> 23:20.780
more of it but some of your short stories you do get I guess kind of what I'm not sure

23:20.780 --> 23:26.540
playful is the right word but one of my favorites was Cinderella story where you sort of retold

23:26.540 --> 23:28.740
the I guess the folktale of Cinderella.

23:30.780 --> 23:35.540
Let me specify let me focus down why did you do that just to have a fun story to write.

23:37.160 --> 23:49.740
Well it just the idea occurred to me and in part I think because myths and fairy tales

23:49.740 --> 24:00.120
are good things to retell and Bob Sheckley for instance has done a lot of these and in

24:00.120 --> 24:04.600
fact at one time when I was talking to him about a problem I have with the story I forgot

24:04.600 --> 24:11.700
which one it was he said well my friend says whenever I have a problem just go look for

24:11.700 --> 24:15.220
a good fairy tale and it will fill the gap.

24:16.160 --> 24:22.200
I didn't know whether that occurred to me at the time but certainly I did have the notion

24:22.200 --> 24:33.380
I was going to retell this story as another kind of you know as it might have worked

24:33.380 --> 24:41.860
out under different kinds of influences and I think you are right occasionally I do like

24:41.860 --> 24:46.980
to tell a story in kind of a playful and I hope amusing way.

24:49.150 --> 25:01.200
My own feeling about fantasy I haven't written a great deal of it mostly because I don't

25:01.200 --> 25:07.000
think you can say things you can incorporate ideas in fantasy as easily and most of the

25:07.000 --> 25:15.700
fantasies I've done it rather humorous and mostly I guess I'm concerned with writing

25:16.420 --> 25:22.380
an idea that really grabs me by the throat and says deal with me.

25:23.620 --> 25:34.740
I also have a feeling too I think the fantasy is somehow not quite as good as science fiction

25:36.060 --> 25:43.060
because it doesn't demand the same kind of rigor it seems a little looser a little freer

25:43.580 --> 25:51.480
and that's maybe less demanding maybe it's too easy to write.

25:52.380 --> 25:58.620
Certainly today there's an awful lot of fantasy being published mostly adventure fantasy and

25:58.620 --> 26:04.480
I find this uninteresting and I'm kind of just floored a little bit because I wonder

26:04.480 --> 26:12.600
who out there is reading it and whether it's the people who are reading it belong to a

26:12.600 --> 26:20.960
group like the people who are into the occult and into UFOs and who are looking for some

26:22.500 --> 26:28.380
answer other than the human intelligence and the human courage to solve their problems.

26:30.120 --> 26:33.780
Yeah I was going to ask you why you thought it was so popular today it seems to be.

26:34.540 --> 26:42.380
Yeah and I think I'm not sure and I'm dealing with this in a in the SFRA annual meeting

26:42.380 --> 26:49.260
that's coming up I've just gotten finished writing the first draft of an article which

26:49.260 --> 26:58.440
I may use as an address for that meeting in July dealing with the question of the audience

26:58.440 --> 27:05.100
that is may or may not be out there for fantasy it may be a publishing phenomenon stimulated

27:05.100 --> 27:14.160
by Tokens Lord of the Rings trilogy success and but there apparently are people out there

27:14.160 --> 27:24.740
buying it and reading it and in a way it represents a kind of dangerous tendency I think if it

27:24.740 --> 27:32.420
is as popular as it seems because I think it threatens to swamp the science fiction

27:32.420 --> 27:41.200
novel which I think is more important. This is sort of a comment but we interviewed Terry

27:41.200 --> 27:46.320
Carr a couple weeks ago and he thought that fantasy is more difficult to write because

27:46.320 --> 27:53.160
to make it to make it what to create a real world that's an imaginary one that's not extrapolated

27:53.160 --> 27:56.280
takes he thought more skill than it does to write a science fiction book.

27:57.960 --> 28:04.280
He may be right or it may just be a different different people with different definitions

28:04.940 --> 28:15.540
of difficulty. I recognize the fact that in my fantasies that I've written I'm not primarily

28:15.540 --> 28:22.280
trying to create a new fantasy world what I'm trying to do is to change one element

28:22.880 --> 28:33.140
in today's world in a fantastic way and see how contemporary life reacts to it and that's

28:33.140 --> 28:40.080
a different matter. Okay this may be one more question on fantasy. You sort of implied some

28:40.080 --> 28:45.460
ideas about this earlier. You might just briefly tell me though why or how how would you personally

28:45.460 --> 28:51.560
differentiate it from science fiction? I think it's a very important differentiation

28:51.560 --> 28:58.740
because I think it matters in the way we approach science fiction and fantasy as readers.

29:00.300 --> 29:08.480
Science fiction though it deals with a world that is different from the one we live in

29:08.480 --> 29:15.320
here and now either through the alteration of one thing or maybe by a significant alteration

29:15.910 --> 29:24.640
in the future and but nevertheless we recognize that this is a world that we can get to from

29:24.640 --> 29:34.020
here. It exists in our universe even though that universe may be far extended into distance

29:34.410 --> 29:41.760
or time but there is a clear sequence of events which take us there according to the basic

29:41.760 --> 29:49.440
laws that we know operate in terms of both the physical laws and psychological laws and

29:49.440 --> 29:57.720
so forth. In fantasy it is a radical different world but one which we can't get to from

29:57.720 --> 30:02.520
here it is not our universe it is some new different universe in which the laws are

30:02.520 --> 30:10.360
different and when we read science fiction we automatically make intellectual comparisons

30:11.160 --> 30:16.220
you know really hard core science fiction and I think one thing that's confusing about

30:16.220 --> 30:22.140
science fiction is the fact that a lot of other things are brought in to the science fiction

30:22.140 --> 30:32.940
adventure, romance and the gothic and detective story all of them can be told as science fiction

30:32.940 --> 30:39.300
stories. Nevertheless in the real hard core science fiction novel you're expected to make

30:39.300 --> 30:49.800
intellectual comparisons between here and now and the there and then of the novel and

30:51.080 --> 30:58.620
this relates on an intellectual level. When you read fantasy you are supposed to be concerned

30:58.620 --> 31:09.280
with the human psychology and the allegorical meaning. You do not use the word for the meaning

31:09.300 --> 31:14.740
you use intellectual perceptions of how we got there from here because there is no way

31:14.740 --> 31:20.880
to get there from here and so you read it with acceptance of the difference and not

31:20.880 --> 31:29.300
with questioning of it. Okay very good listen I better just ask you just a couple more

31:29.300 --> 31:34.960
so we can you know this is last this is really taking too much of your time. One thing I

31:34.960 --> 31:39.620
would like to get your comment on since you I think have a very valuable perspective on

31:39.620 --> 31:45.440
this do you think science fiction has changed much since you became involved in it and what

31:45.440 --> 31:52.700
would those changes be? Well my experience covers 34 years from the time I began writing

31:52.700 --> 31:58.340
it and many more than that at the time I began reading it yes I think it's changed significantly

31:58.960 --> 32:07.220
it has gone from being primarily a magazine literature to primarily a book literature

32:08.560 --> 32:14.820
there are still science fiction magazines being published but it's today primarily it's

32:14.820 --> 32:22.880
primary publications and book form and it has gone from being a category literature

32:22.880 --> 32:28.660
a generic literature to one of much broader acceptance and much broader popularity and

32:28.660 --> 32:38.500
it's gone from being written like most other pulp literature rapidly and with a certain

32:38.500 --> 32:48.180
carelessness for basic skills of storytelling literature to what is now certainly comfortable

32:48.180 --> 33:01.620
with any other kind of writing in terms of its literary value. I'm sure you've noted

33:01.620 --> 33:06.220
this I wonder what your response to it is the proliferation of trilogies that are written

33:06.220 --> 33:13.160
these days some people feel that that is sort of leading to second class writing when people

33:13.160 --> 33:18.000
have to write the trilogy do you have any ideas about that? Yes I would sort of agree

33:18.000 --> 33:25.460
with that although certainly I can understand the authorial necessity to do it because it

33:25.460 --> 33:32.540
seems to pay off and increased audience and increased sales and the publishers wanting

33:32.540 --> 33:43.140
to do that but I agree that I think it's a poorer or more like a more more like a more

33:44.000 --> 33:52.280
more it's a poorer art form and I've never really felt the necessity or the desirability

33:52.280 --> 33:59.500
of writing novel or writing sequel I've always felt that if I can't say it in one book I

33:59.500 --> 34:07.240
really haven't thought it through very well and I think the economic pressures are leading

34:07.240 --> 34:15.600
authors to not only to write sequels but even to extend theories long beyond the point

34:15.600 --> 34:22.160
at which there are artistic impulses say it should be ended. The originally doomed was

34:22.160 --> 34:28.700
supposed to be a trilogy and now Frank Herbert has accepted a contract in advance to write

34:28.700 --> 34:36.540
a fifth volume simply because the preceding one's a sold better. Similarly Gene Wolfe

34:36.540 --> 34:42.700
has agreed to write a fifth volume to his planned tetralogy the book of the new sun

34:42.700 --> 34:49.680
and young writers are coming into the field thinking that the way to success is to take

34:49.680 --> 34:59.000
a series of characters and bring them through what essentially is an adventure series of

34:59.000 --> 35:06.520
adventures which is what most trilogies are. There are adventure novels, there are adventure

35:06.540 --> 35:16.540
novels with very little science fiction background to them. There are exceptions of course, and

35:17.460 --> 35:25.300
the book of the new sun both are more carefully planned but most series most trilogies are

35:25.300 --> 35:31.800
simple adventure stories. Okay I would just have one more could you tell me what your

35:32.260 --> 35:39.360
future plans are for your own writing in terms of fiction and criticism both? Right now I

35:39.360 --> 35:47.700
am sort of between books. I have had for a long time a plan for a very ambitious novel

35:48.680 --> 35:53.460
and maybe I'll get down to working at that one of these days. I want to write some short

35:53.460 --> 36:01.780
stories particularly I want to try to continue a series of stories that I began in the early

36:01.800 --> 36:09.520
with a story called child of the sun several years ago which I viewed originally as a series

36:09.520 --> 36:17.820
and had been a chance to deal with and I think could be a significant development and one

36:17.820 --> 36:26.560
which I had initially proposed as a television series and was at one point actually option

36:27.280 --> 36:36.440
for a possible television series and I do still have a book or two of criticism or collections

36:36.440 --> 36:41.640
of stories that I'd like to do. I'd like to do a collection for instance of English science

36:41.640 --> 36:50.420
fiction stories because there isn't anything in current production currently available.

36:50.910 --> 36:57.100
I'd like to use it in my classes. Mostly the books I've done in criticism have been those

36:57.100 --> 37:03.780
books which I felt I wanted for my class but I wasn't able to find anywhere so I did

37:03.780 --> 37:12.900
them myself. Okay fine Mr. Garnersen what we'll do I really appreciate the time you've given

37:12.900 --> 37:18.380
us this is a long time if you wouldn't mind if we don't make it up for that SFRA meeting

37:18.380 --> 37:23.060
maybe sometime in the fall we could call you back and get a little more because there's

37:23.060 --> 37:28.240
a whole area of questions like on the SFRA and SFWA and so forth that we had but listen

37:28.240 --> 37:34.840
what we'll do is when these shows are edited we will send you copies of the tapes and also

37:35.280 --> 37:39.920
I will send you a list we will find out if there are any stations in your area that carry

37:39.920 --> 37:44.640
the show. Okay. I'd like to know that. And so if possibly if you ever want to pick it

37:44.640 --> 37:49.320
up we don't have a complete list from our syndicator yet but when we get it I'll send

37:49.320 --> 37:53.220
that on to you. Well good luck to you and I you know stay in touch. And thank you very

37:53.220 --> 37:55.780
much we appreciate your time sir. Right. Bye. Bye.
