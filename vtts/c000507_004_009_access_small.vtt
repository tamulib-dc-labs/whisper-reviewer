Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:27.940 --> 00:33.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.540
And here are your hosts.

00:41.460 --> 00:43.580
This is Bill Vernon and Darrell Lane.

00:43.740 --> 00:46.580
Janet Morris has written seven science fiction novels so far.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.260
These are grouped into two series, the Solistria series and the Saga of the Carian Empire.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.580
Morris's novels are characterized by strongly developed characters and well-drawn backgrounds,

00:55.780 --> 00:56.800
and they feature hard science.

00:57.300 --> 01:01.860
The Solistria series consists of four novels, High Couch of Solistria, The Golden Sword,

01:02.320 --> 01:04.660
Wind from the Abyss, and The Carnelian Throne.

01:04.660 --> 01:08.960
The protagonist of the series is Estri, the courtesan who gradually learns more about her

01:08.960 --> 01:10.660
real identity and the power she is inherited.

01:11.340 --> 01:14.000
The series, still incomplete, chronicles Estri's awakening.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.920
We asked Morris what she was aiming at when she wrote the series.

01:17.860 --> 01:23.360
I was asked to return to come to terms with the fact that logically and mathematically,

01:23.720 --> 01:29.520
I couldn't come to terms with the incidents of the ESP that I experienced in my own life,

01:29.520 --> 01:37.640
and some of the more tenuous philosophical intuitions that I was having that I just couldn't state.

01:38.140 --> 01:41.840
There's no other way really to state those concepts on one level.

01:42.980 --> 01:52.080
The relationship of mind to probability, our connection to time, whether we indeed are co-creators

01:52.080 --> 01:56.860
in some sense of the universe in which we're living and we're making a future in the past at

01:56.860 --> 02:02.280
once, and sometimes in particle physics I begin to wonder if the universe isn't just giving us

02:02.280 --> 02:06.820
whatever particle we choose to dream up, you know, as soon as we think it up then it comes into being

02:07.620 --> 02:11.880
because we seem to be going further and further down and every time we go down another level,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.940
I mean the quark split up into little quarks and it's endless.

02:16.480 --> 02:20.320
And a lot of times you could come up with a good mathematical reason for something,

02:20.420 --> 02:26.700
then maybe the universe is convinced and it produces, I have no idea of whether that's going to

02:26.700 --> 02:33.000
turn out to be what it is, but if indeed it is, if the anthropic principle is anywhere near valid,

02:33.200 --> 02:38.200
that it is something like that happening, that we are in a sense central to creation,

02:38.500 --> 02:40.420
which would be nice. I mean it suits my ink, it just...

02:45.840 --> 02:47.720
Morris had other aims in mind as well.

02:48.180 --> 02:54.180
On another level I wanted to talk about genetic predispositions and very bright people

02:55.660 --> 03:01.900
have a particular problem with both human relationships and sexuality and I wanted to

03:01.900 --> 03:07.580
talk about that because no matter how intelligent and logical you are at a certain point you have

03:07.580 --> 03:12.400
to deal with what is your genetic conditioning and you really get a snoop full of it in a sex act,

03:13.420 --> 03:20.120
a person who is intelligent and monitors what's happening to them as they become around,

03:20.120 --> 03:27.200
really realizes that there is a different and much more primeval person inside each of us and

03:28.460 --> 03:36.260
I had at that time begun to despair of nurture having anything to do at all with human behavior,

03:36.460 --> 03:42.020
thinking that it was almost everything we do seem to me at that point, time to be genetically prompted.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.240
What Ed Wilson said that the urge to creativity might be inextricably linked to the desire

03:51.240 --> 03:54.720
to own and dominate and that's one of the central themes there.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.920
Morris' upbringing also influenced her writing the series.

03:58.820 --> 04:04.360
I was sort of born post-deliberated, I was the guy, I was the oldest child and I was very intelligent

04:04.360 --> 04:10.580
and I was expected to do all the things that any young man was supposed to do so I had come to

04:10.580 --> 04:16.680
grips with being a post-deliberated female and these people were trying to get to where I started

04:16.680 --> 04:22.560
out in agony, these women's livers not realizing what they were letting themselves in for, I also

04:22.560 --> 04:29.300
wanted to talk about that and the Estri persona is a persona that is in no way

04:31.840 --> 04:37.900
less than holy female while being very intelligent and reasonably comfortable with that talent.

04:38.620 --> 04:43.280
So I wanted to talk about it, it was an injection at that time that was putting into consciousness

04:43.280 --> 04:48.240
to sort of inoculate people against extremes of the female liberation.

04:49.260 --> 04:51.920
More on Janet and Morris' Solistor series on our next show.

04:59.040 --> 05:03.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:03.780 --> 05:07.600
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.860
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.700 --> 06:17.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on Science Fiction and Fantasy

06:20.620 --> 06:22.160
and here are your hosts.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.100
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

06:28.540 --> 06:32.320
Janet and Morris' four-volume Solistor series has had a highly successful sales record.

06:32.320 --> 06:36.420
With this series, it's interesting to know that although the books themselves are explicitly

06:36.420 --> 06:41.220
Science Fiction, they're packaged as fantasy. Right, the covers in all four of the novels feature

06:41.220 --> 06:45.840
a scantily clad voluptuous woman holding a sword, a scene typical of countless fantasy novels.

06:46.040 --> 06:50.200
And the spines of two of the novels actually say fantasy under the publisher's colifen.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.880
We asked Morris why the novels appeared with these covers.

06:53.880 --> 06:58.480
The difference in that particular case was that Fred Rick Paul, who was my first editor,

06:58.480 --> 07:05.960
who knew what was Science Fiction left, and the other, I guess, operative difference was that

07:05.960 --> 07:09.100
at the point in time when they came out, they could get a big old print run if they called it

07:09.100 --> 07:15.360
fantasy. So it was an editorial difference rather than a real difference, but those covers did not

07:15.360 --> 07:20.780
help me in the least get those books to the kind of people that I should be reading them.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.420
Here Morris goes on to tell us her feelings about Science Fiction and fantasy.

07:58.560 --> 08:03.600
Problems and questions is just as important as showing that you indeed do understand

08:04.280 --> 08:08.820
this or that particular principle, which seems right now to be valid until next week. It turns

08:08.820 --> 08:14.720
out that, well, it just was fudge factor. So I don't know if there's a difference for me,

08:15.600 --> 08:21.700
unfortunately. Fantasy right now seems to be where the writers go that don't do any homework

08:22.420 --> 08:29.240
and don't really understand either this world or the principles on which fantasy was originally

08:29.240 --> 08:35.000
based, the Homeric tradition and a good sense of history and honor and all those nice things that

08:35.000 --> 08:42.540
we don't talk about too much anymore. And Science Fiction is where people write who at least have

08:43.400 --> 08:49.880
a willingness to pay some lip service to a logical mind. Fantasy used to be a lot better

08:49.880 --> 08:56.060
when less people were writing it. But right now there's a lot of very mediocre writers writing,

08:56.240 --> 09:02.060
you know, good and evil fantasy or warmed over Christian mythology, which is not to me what

09:02.060 --> 09:08.200
fantasy is about. I love Conan, you know, original Howard stuff and all the real old stuff and Homer

09:08.200 --> 09:14.280
and Hesse had been, that to me is good fantasy. Science Fiction, when it's good, is great.

09:18.100 --> 09:24.500
The problem exists in Science Fiction in a different form where the young writers who don't

09:25.220 --> 09:32.300
really have a good conceptual basis in Science Fiction use what I call nuts and bolts, which is

09:32.300 --> 09:38.860
just data that they can get from encyclopedia as their science and have a little trick ending in

09:38.860 --> 09:44.940
which some scientific principle is involved to resolve the plot. But for me, good Science Fiction

09:44.940 --> 09:52.500
has the science as an integral part of the development of the story and you couldn't have the story

09:53.020 --> 10:01.900
without the scientific principle or the theoretical questions that you're basing it on. In other

10:01.900 --> 10:05.820
words, if you can take the science out of it and you still got a story, then you shouldn't have

10:05.820 --> 10:12.200
Science Fiction. It should be something else, TV, something like that. But Science Fiction should have

10:13.420 --> 10:17.600
almost the science and the theory or the world or whatever you want to call it, the structure that

10:17.600 --> 10:23.520
you're making it as a central character and that's what it does, when it does it best frees the mind

10:23.520 --> 10:27.880
and allows people to come away with lots of good questions that they can think about rather than

10:27.880 --> 10:32.320
providing tad answers which indeed you have a very limited lifespan we've all seen.

10:33.180 --> 10:35.180
Moore with Janet Morris on our next show.

10:42.280 --> 10:47.060
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

10:47.060 --> 10:50.880
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.160
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:54.780 --> 12:00.020
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on Science Fiction and Fantasy.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.360
And here are your hosts.

12:08.560 --> 12:13.160
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. Science Fiction author Janet Morris' Saga of the

12:13.160 --> 12:17.820
Karrion Empire is a trilogy comprising dream dancer, cruiser dreams and earth dreams.

12:18.300 --> 12:22.520
The time is the 23rd century and the milieu is earth and several human colonized planets

12:22.520 --> 12:27.240
and far away star systems. The heroine is Sheba, a teenager from earth which by this time has

12:27.240 --> 12:31.880
reverted to a medieval culture. The trilogy describes her coming of age as a ward of the

12:31.880 --> 12:36.620
rulers of the human empire, the Karrion family. The saga of the Karrion Empire is an exciting

12:36.620 --> 12:41.540
blend of characterization, speculative physics and political intrigue. We asked Morris if she

12:41.540 --> 12:46.060
plotted the whole series in detail before she wrote it. I was going to do three, I signed

12:46.060 --> 12:50.900
form before I did them. Three was all there was going to be, three is all there is going to be.

12:51.400 --> 12:55.220
You know, unless something drastically changes then I see where it's someplace that I'd like to

12:55.220 --> 13:01.400
take it. I knew exactly what I wanted to talk about physics and the rest of it. I was,

13:01.400 --> 13:05.700
I wanted to create a female character that had all the flaws that Estre did not,

13:06.160 --> 13:12.680
that was totally opposite. And to talk a little about politics, I come from a very

13:14.360 --> 13:20.020
political background. My half sister was Carter speech writer on economic policy. I know way too

13:20.020 --> 13:26.200
much about politics to suit me. And I wanted to talk a little bit about politics and decision

13:26.200 --> 13:35.100
making at higher levels and what indeed happens to the people involved in it and the people

13:35.100 --> 13:40.820
affected by it who have no control of it. And the nice stuff for me that balanced it off was

13:44.020 --> 13:48.660
the culture that was comfortable with its technology growing into its technology,

13:48.660 --> 13:54.020
growing along with its technology. And I mean for me the cruisers were the main characters there.

13:54.020 --> 14:00.720
I loved doing the cruisers sections although they were very difficult at times to make it really

14:03.100 --> 14:08.840
seem as if they were cruises. And you know one never knows if one succeeded but for me they really

14:08.840 --> 14:15.820
were cruises. Plus I had the whole of history to draw on instead of having culture that had nothing

14:15.820 --> 14:20.160
to do with us. I had a culture that had everything to do with us. There had been no collapse, no

14:20.160 --> 14:25.700
world war three, everything had proceeded at pace and just gotten worse. The problems with

14:25.700 --> 14:29.720
quantum mechanics hadn't been solved, the problems with anything else had been solved and we were

14:29.720 --> 14:35.400
just sort of muddling along the way we tend to do. And that to me was a lot of fun. But as I said

14:35.400 --> 14:41.160
I did the partial and it went to auction in two countries on the partial and I was so

14:41.160 --> 14:47.760
slow to hear in England at the same time had two editors trying to keep the volumes consistent.

14:47.760 --> 14:52.680
Every editor has a different idea of what exactly they want you to do and they all want to mix them.

14:53.580 --> 14:57.780
It's very seldom you get an editor that leaves you totally alone. It doesn't bother you at all

14:57.780 --> 15:04.780
about a book. And I had to split the difference on one occasion between them and one editor wanted

15:04.780 --> 15:09.280
one section to be longer and the other one wanted the same section to be shorter in the same

15:09.980 --> 15:17.740
just the same 30 pages. And I ended up doing a prologue which seemed to satisfy them both. I

15:17.740 --> 15:23.600
had done that. So they work whole-bloodedly meant to be exactly what they are.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.960
Morris told us that she wrote this trilogy with the mature, literate, scientifically

15:27.960 --> 15:33.780
sophisticated reader in mind. Apparently her strategy worked. So I go to these conventions

15:33.780 --> 15:38.300
and they'd all raise their hands and say yes they want more science and yes they were ready to work

15:38.300 --> 15:43.940
a little and yes they wanted to be challenged and I said okay, well we don't. And I wrote a book in

15:43.940 --> 15:52.440
which I wrote to my ideal reader, didn't talk down, didn't simplify it, did what I consider a good

15:52.440 --> 15:59.180
job of explaining mathematics as poetry and just let fly. And so far the reaction to it's been very

15:59.180 --> 16:03.060
good as I told you the first printing has had been through two printings before publication

16:03.060 --> 16:08.920
or in three. It has been doing very well. You get some people that don't want to work but I think

16:08.920 --> 16:14.580
there's enough story there to carry them over the parts that they are not willing to try to understand.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.260
More with Janet Morris on our next show.

16:24.680 --> 16:29.380
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:29.380 --> 16:33.200
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:34.460 --> 17:39.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.060
And here are your hosts.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.720
This is Darrell Lane and Bill Vernon. Science fiction author Janet Morris has written the

17:52.720 --> 17:57.440
Solistra series and the saga of the Carrion Empire. Her novels are of high quality and when one reads

17:57.440 --> 18:02.000
them it's apparent she's done her homework on all facets of the novels, the characters, the science,

18:02.160 --> 18:07.160
the background, everything. We wondered if Morris uses feedback from her fans. We asked her initially

18:07.160 --> 18:12.060
as she goes to Science Fiction conventions. Her answer reveals a lot about how a writer approaches her work.

18:20.020 --> 18:23.060
When I'm researching, it takes up a tremendous amount of time.

18:23.580 --> 18:31.580
Two, because I'm arrogant and I like to control things. On the other hand, I'm very sensitive and

18:31.580 --> 18:38.100
I can always manage to get offended if somebody says, I was guest of honor at Carrion. I did that

18:38.100 --> 18:43.820
one and I'm going to do Lunacon in March because I really like that New York crowd.

18:44.400 --> 18:51.400
Otherwise, I mean my writing schedules are very heavy. I just turned in a book. I just started a

18:51.400 --> 18:59.060
book which is doing just about the amount of time I have to finish it. I don't have a lot of extra time

19:01.220 --> 19:05.180
to do more than the work that I'm doing. I'm real conscientious of my homework

19:05.700 --> 19:10.460
and a lot of times there's, you can never know enough about the subjects that you're writing about

19:10.460 --> 19:14.300
When you're creating whole worlds, you find there's something that you need to know that you

19:14.300 --> 19:17.460
haven't, I mean physics alone will not get you through a Science Fiction novel,

19:18.180 --> 19:23.080
nor will any other specialty, not biology. There's no single thing you can do that's going to allow

19:23.080 --> 19:28.380
you to create an entire culture and change it. It's not just creating the culture, you've got to be

19:28.380 --> 19:35.560
able to create it and change it. So the homework really takes a tremendous amount of effort.

19:36.120 --> 19:41.320
And it's nice to do a fancy book now, almost as a break or a pay vacation because

19:43.500 --> 19:48.120
that homework I did years ago. And I remember all the things I need to know to do that. I don't

19:48.120 --> 19:53.460
have to go. I think I have like three books on my desk, Herculean Stochastic Fragments,

19:53.600 --> 19:58.260
one on Asian Fighting Styles and a Classical Fictionary from Oxford. And that is all I need

19:58.260 --> 20:03.320
rather than, you know, three shelves and the stool and a pile on the floor of stuff that I have to

20:03.320 --> 20:20.600
be able to refer to all the time. So, cons, the kind of feedback you get at cons

20:22.660 --> 20:28.800
isn't as good as I could feedback through letters, but sales figures and letters are really the way.

20:28.800 --> 20:35.440
And also, you know, there are readers around here. I do book signings and I do small things where I

20:35.440 --> 20:40.320
can control them a little better than I can at the real big. I mean, I'll do a World Con or

20:40.820 --> 20:46.520
I'd went to England for a St. Con. I do one or two a year, but really all the time that I want to give it,

20:48.120 --> 20:54.560
it takes me about a week. It's a different person that has to go to a con. My writer is too open,

20:54.560 --> 20:59.600
so I do create this other person, my author, and the author goes to the cons and it takes me

20:59.600 --> 21:04.080
about a week to get rid of this author afterwards because when you sit at that typewriter, there's

21:04.080 --> 21:10.060
no room for you, the writer, you have to erase yourself so that the characters can be there and

21:10.060 --> 21:17.400
the story can come. And if I'm self-conscious or somebody has said something to me about there

21:17.400 --> 21:22.680
being too much science or not enough science or my books of fantasies to get really upset with

21:22.680 --> 21:29.600
those fantasy labels, I'm liable to take it too much to heart and to react to it on paper and

21:29.600 --> 21:34.620
do something to my story, which I don't want to happen because it's something that's happened.

21:34.740 --> 21:39.720
I just got a real good review in the New York Daily News and I hate the good ones as much as I hate

21:39.720 --> 21:45.320
the bad ones. They never like them for the right reasons. So the best thing really is just the

21:45.320 --> 21:50.340
letters from people, you know, who read them three times and loved them, or who asked me intelligent

21:50.340 --> 21:54.420
questions which I try to answer. More with Janet Morris on our next show.

22:01.700 --> 22:06.440
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

22:06.440 --> 22:10.280
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:56.300 --> 23:00.220
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:15.860 --> 23:21.140
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.440
And here are your hosts.

23:29.620 --> 23:34.120
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. Science Fiction author Janet Morris has written seven

23:34.120 --> 23:39.440
novels so far. Both her series feature female protagonists who are neither shrinking violets

23:39.440 --> 23:44.580
nor female versions of Conan the Barbarian or Superman. Estrian and Shebbat are believable

23:44.580 --> 23:48.500
characters. They are women with both strong points and weak points as are most human beings.

23:49.040 --> 23:53.400
Morris does not use them to preach a particular point of view. Morris feels very strongly that

23:53.400 --> 23:57.700
women must be willing to tackle the future head on, be willing to embrace and make use

23:57.700 --> 24:01.740
of technological developments. In fact, she believes these developments will lessen the

24:01.740 --> 24:04.200
importance of physical differences between the sexes.

24:23.400 --> 24:27.840
The same instrument. One can be equal at a computer if one masters the computer. There's

24:27.840 --> 24:33.200
no law. There's a potential for a real equality, an intellectual equality. Now, it has never existed

24:33.200 --> 24:39.920
before, partly because menial labor and physical strength is no longer a great part of what makes

24:39.920 --> 24:45.520
one a functional human being in society and partly because of the concerns of the society

24:45.520 --> 24:53.200
itself. It is not going to happen if women don't start doing their own work in the areas involved

24:53.200 --> 24:57.640
and getting their facility out there. And if I can do it, the rest of them can do it.

24:58.180 --> 25:03.700
There's no reason why anyone should be in a self-inflicted ghetto.

25:06.680 --> 25:14.940
I'd really like to see ladies spending more time trying to become premier in their field

25:15.600 --> 25:21.000
the way a guy has to. I mean, it's a responsibility that one takes on very early in life. I am

25:21.000 --> 25:26.200
going to be successful at something specific besides childbearing. Not that childbearing is in

25:26.200 --> 25:31.020
a nice part of life, but there definitely is more. Although Morris writes about competent female

25:31.020 --> 25:35.820
protagonists and she herself is obviously a very capable individual, she does not necessarily go

25:35.820 --> 25:41.700
along with the feminist movement. People assume that I am a feminist and I really don't want to be

25:41.700 --> 25:45.840
associated with a bunch of ladies standing out in the middle of the street screaming for their rights.

25:46.480 --> 25:52.740
It's just not me. I'm not comfortable with them. I don't agree with them. I don't like oversimplification.

25:53.340 --> 25:59.520
I don't believe that conditioning is a great part of what makes a person what they are or that the

25:59.520 --> 26:03.120
fact that if you're a little girl and you don't have pockets in your pants, you're doomed.

26:04.360 --> 26:11.940
I don't believe it. A great degree of it is genetic inheritance, but one does have control over one's

26:11.940 --> 26:17.860
own. So intelligence will go where you point it. And there are plenty of intelligent women out there.

26:18.700 --> 26:23.840
I'd like to see them do something with that intelligence. Morris is herself, an individual

26:23.840 --> 26:28.200
who aspires to achieve and to succeed. She doesn't look externally for her identity.

26:28.920 --> 26:35.700
I've ended up on panels before I knew better at conventions where I look around me and everyone

26:35.700 --> 26:40.920
else on that panel is a woman and someone has put me in a ghetto and invariably they all write

26:40.920 --> 26:47.280
fantasy or they all write very light science fiction. And nobody is writing the sort of thing

26:47.280 --> 26:51.580
that I'm writing and nobody is interested in talking about what I'm interested in talking about.

26:51.620 --> 26:56.660
I was at one where the moderator said, oh, isn't this wonderful where all ladies will have a

26:56.660 --> 27:03.360
consciousness raising fashion and I just about split under the table. It's just not my style.

27:03.540 --> 27:08.700
It's not what I'm interested in. It's not what I'm comfortable with. And I don't even mind if

27:09.420 --> 27:14.460
large groups of females want to organize for their rights, although the Constitution does not

27:14.460 --> 27:21.980
guarantee any right except the right to struggle to succeed. Nobody's given you the right to have

27:21.980 --> 27:28.480
anything gratis in America just to try to get it. But they're not speaking for me.

27:29.020 --> 27:33.780
Janet Morris is an outstanding writer who made her appearance in the late 1970s. The care she

27:33.780 --> 27:37.640
puts into her characters and into the science in her science fiction makes her books well worth reading.

27:44.760 --> 27:49.600
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

27:49.600 --> 27:53.400
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
