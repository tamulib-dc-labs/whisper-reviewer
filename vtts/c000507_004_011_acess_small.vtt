Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.560 --> 00:35.180
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:35.180 --> 00:39.700
And here are your hosts.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.600
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:46.900 --> 00:51.300
Of all the themes handled by science fiction authors, that of alien contact has been one

00:51.300 --> 00:53.420
of the most consistently popular and fascinating.

00:53.900 --> 00:54.820
For a good reason too.

00:55.500 --> 00:59.900
Aliens, whether they be the hostile bug-eyed monsters of the old pulp magazines or the friendly

00:59.900 --> 01:03.680
creatures of close encounters of the third kind, have always been one of the biggest

01:03.680 --> 01:05.000
attractions of science fiction.

01:05.580 --> 01:10.260
In the past, stories of alien contact were usually written as thrillers, with the sole

01:10.260 --> 01:12.320
and simple intention of scaring readers.

01:13.020 --> 01:17.840
HD Wells, The War of the Worlds, is probably the best example of that type of story.

01:18.160 --> 01:18.960
But that's changed.

01:19.800 --> 01:24.040
Many contemporary writers have provided more thoughtful treatments of aliens, deepening

01:24.040 --> 01:27.300
the realism and the significance of narratives of alien contact.

01:35.540 --> 01:40.440
Of course, before you can have a story of alien contact, you have to have some aliens.

01:41.080 --> 01:45.020
One of the most provocative descriptions of aliens in all of science fiction is found

01:45.020 --> 01:48.560
in Larry Nivens and Jerry Pornell's The Moat in God's Eye.

01:49.060 --> 01:53.800
The success of that book is largely due to the unique and ingenious aliens, the Moaties,

01:54.040 --> 01:55.540
that Niven created for the story.

01:55.980 --> 02:00.180
It's interesting though, that Niven says he doesn't really create aliens for a story,

02:00.560 --> 02:02.460
but suggests that it's the other way around.

02:03.340 --> 02:07.200
I always design aliens for themselves.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.780
I almost never design an alien to match a story.

02:12.420 --> 02:17.280
The story, some story, will eventually include the alien.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.320
The alien stands for itself.

02:20.020 --> 02:24.520
There are two particularly fascinating things that Niven incorporated into these Moaties.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.760
One is the fact that they are not symmetrical.

02:27.450 --> 02:32.380
They have a head, torso, legs and arms, as humans do, but the arms are disproportionate.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.100
One is small and thin, the other is large and powerful.

02:35.480 --> 02:35.760
Right.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.260
Niven says he took that idea from studying the structures of living creatures on Earth.

02:41.000 --> 02:49.980
In that case, I had the idea that I was following a progression with a protozoan, with an amoeba.

02:50.530 --> 02:53.680
You get radial symmetry inside and out.

02:54.960 --> 03:03.460
Move up a goodly distance and you find starfishes with radial symmetry on the outside and bilateral symmetry on the inside.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.840
Move up a little further, you find flat worms and worms of all stance.

03:10.020 --> 03:14.100
At the level of bilateral symmetry inside and out.

03:14.600 --> 03:24.980
The goal is as far as a human, you find bilateral symmetry on the outside and no symmetry, well, half symmetrical on the inside.

03:25.380 --> 03:28.600
The lungs look symmetrical, the kidneys look symmetrical.

03:29.260 --> 03:32.620
The intestines look like somebody dropped a plate of spaghetti.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.620
I tried to move on to the next step.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.780
Bilaterally unsymmetrical on the outside.

03:41.780 --> 03:46.720
And I got the original Modi, which was the engineer for us.

03:58.220 --> 04:02.840
The other ingenious idea Niven developed for the Modi's is the way they construct and use machines.

04:03.620 --> 04:09.320
They're highly skilled tool users, but they have no standard pre-manufactured machines, parts or tools.

04:09.320 --> 04:13.920
They simply alter or reshape whatever they find around them at the time to suit their needs.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.140
Niven says that particular idea just came to him.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.460
It seemed interesting and even logical.

04:20.200 --> 04:25.760
I was just playing with the ideas at that point and that one seemed like a fun one.

04:26.300 --> 04:37.140
It also seemed likely enough if you've got a critter with not much intelligence except in the direction of tool making and tool altering.

04:38.260 --> 04:39.660
Then why not?

04:40.740 --> 04:45.800
The thing has to keep testing its ability or it will lose it.

04:46.400 --> 04:51.280
It might as well be designing something every time it needs a specific machine.

04:52.300 --> 05:00.040
Besides the ingenuity Niven demonstrated in creating the Modi's, he and Pornell also weaved some unexpected twists into the first contact theme.

05:00.860 --> 05:04.060
Our reader interested in aliens are more specifically in first contact.

05:04.460 --> 05:06.580
Can't afford to overlook the Moten Gautzai.

05:07.980 --> 05:08.660
Music

05:13.820 --> 05:19.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:19.900 --> 05:22.920
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:26.040 --> 05:26.720
Music

05:29.600 --> 05:31.000
Music

05:31.000 --> 05:31.540

05:31.540 --> 05:32.360

06:19.980 --> 06:20.540
Music

06:20.540 --> 06:21.380
Music

06:25.220 --> 06:30.620

This is Daryl Lane.

06:41.620 --> 06:42.360
And Bill Vernon.

06:42.740 --> 06:48.780
The so-called New Wave in Science Fiction, which began in the mid-60s, was simply a new way of writing traditional science fiction.

06:48.780 --> 06:53.920
There were changes, for instance, in style, and characterization was given more emphasis.

06:54.580 --> 06:59.400
And the New Wave treated themes such as sex and religion that science fiction hadn't really touched before.

06:59.860 --> 07:07.440
In general, the New Wave changed the stereotype science fiction formulas that had been around since the pulp days of the 20s, 30s, and 40s.

07:07.580 --> 07:13.720
Frederick Poll, who's been an author, an editor, and an agent in the field of science fiction, has something to say about that change.

07:13.720 --> 07:24.500
The New Wave was an attempt, I guess, 15 years ago or more of a number of writers to break away from the traditional kinds of science fiction.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.180
In fact, most of them didn't want to call it science fiction anymore.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.140
They wanted to call it speculative fiction or call it nothing at all.

07:31.880 --> 07:39.920
And they were interested primarily in writing about inner space rather than outer space, and secondarily a lot of them.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.120
Things like the drug culture and rock music and so on.

07:44.900 --> 07:54.260
But in the rather bitter internal struggle that went on in science fiction, a lot of people taking sides one way or the other.

07:54.780 --> 07:56.680
I think everyone was deeply affected.

08:05.680 --> 08:12.360
But we need to remember here that the New Wave wasn't really a planned and deliberate movement by a unified group of writers.

08:12.900 --> 08:20.160
One of the principal proponents of the New Wave, author Norman Spinrad, believes it was just a bunch of diverse writers doing their own thing.

08:20.160 --> 08:26.020
There was an old wave, but there was never as a coherent philosophy in school of science fiction.

08:26.040 --> 08:30.080
But there was never a New Wave in the same sense. There were a lot of waves.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.280
There were a lot of different people doing a lot of different things.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.840
The people that were identified as New Wave were very diverse.

08:36.560 --> 08:45.640
What I was actually writing was very different to what Tom Dish was writing, or Boulard, or Zalazny, Delaney, were also identified as New Wave writers.

08:45.640 --> 08:53.880
This stuff is much more Zalazny and Delaney and myself and Boulard and all this and Mike.

08:55.320 --> 09:03.540
There were more differences between our work than between our work taking us to totality and the old stuff.

09:04.040 --> 09:08.700
There was more difference within the so-called New Wave than there was within the so-called Old Wave.

09:09.480 --> 09:13.900
But Spinrad also thinks the New Wave was tightly connected to what was happening in society.

09:14.880 --> 09:23.760
And of course this mirrored the cultural climate at the time. It mirrored what was happening politically, it mirrored what was happening in music, it mirrored what was happening in movies.

09:24.120 --> 09:28.400
It was a phenomenon that went through the West and civilization as a whole.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.560
There are those who say the New Wave is dead.

09:38.060 --> 09:43.040
Five-time Hugo winner Larry Nivens says so, for instance, and offers a reason for his passing.

09:43.040 --> 09:51.900
The New Wave is a very persuasive thing and very easy to use to justify bad stories.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.640
I think that's what killed it.

09:55.140 --> 10:07.380
Not that increased characterization and experiments with typography and story format are a bad thing in themselves.

10:07.380 --> 10:13.920
It's so easy to use New Wave to justify a bad story. It was bound to collapse.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.580
The influence of the New Wave is still around, though. It's left its mark on the field.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.500
Science fiction has been broadened, maybe enhanced somehow because of it.

10:28.940 --> 10:30.260
Frederick Paul states it well.

10:31.420 --> 10:39.600
And the New Wave, if nothing else, taught a bunch of old dinosaurs like Asimov and Pine Line and Meeth.

10:39.860 --> 10:43.160
But there were non-traditional ways of constructing a novel.

10:43.640 --> 10:51.520
See, most of us had grown up when science fiction was in the pulp magazines, and most of it was written according to some variant of a pulp formula.

10:52.180 --> 10:58.140
It turned out that wasn't necessary. And I think the New Wave is responsible for teaching us that.

11:05.800 --> 11:11.340
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:11.600 --> 11:14.560
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:55.500 --> 11:59.520
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:15.840 --> 12:21.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.800
And here are your hosts.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.760
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.380
The award-winning novel Ringworld is probably Larry Niven's finest work.

12:36.980 --> 12:43.600
The Ringworld is an immense ring, large enough to hold 3 million Earths, and with a thousand mile high wall to hold in its atmosphere.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.620
It also has continents and oceans.

12:46.340 --> 12:51.520
The Ringworld contains trillions of inhabitants of different species and derives energy from the sun at its center.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.440
Niven recalls where he obtained the idea for such a fantastic structure.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.200
I ran across the concept basin sphere.

13:01.400 --> 13:08.080
Dyson the mathematician came up with the concept basin shell and he was misunderstood to some extent.

13:08.540 --> 13:12.760
So presently I ran across an article about basin spheres.

13:13.480 --> 13:20.240
A picture that is a golf ball 93 million miles in radius with a sun at the center.

13:20.240 --> 13:26.080
And gravity generators all around the outside so he would live on the inside.

13:26.320 --> 13:31.180
Terraform it with oceans and soil and air.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.520
I ran across that and I didn't like it.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.880
I thought it could be improved.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.340
And I wound up with the Ringworld.

13:46.520 --> 13:52.660
Ritter studied the science behind the Ringworld and wrote Niven about seeming inconsistencies in the design of the immense artifact.

13:53.880 --> 13:58.900
Column errors and elaborations because some of them don't really fit the errors.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.540
It's just something that hadn't gotten into the original book.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.960
One of the errors was spotted by some MIT students.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.320
It had to do with the instability of the Ringworld.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.700
The Ringworld is unstable.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.420
The Ringworld is unstable.

14:41.600 --> 14:48.460
It still took about seven years for anyone to figure out the exact numbers for the instability.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.860
And they are horrifying.

14:50.180 --> 14:57.820
The Ringworld a major solar flare would have the Ringworld grinding against its sun in five years.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.960
Well I worked it into a plot.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.520
That was one elaboration or error.

15:05.220 --> 15:09.200
Even teenage readers analyzed his Ringworld with a critical scientific eye.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.460
A high school class in Florida got to work on the Ringworld.

15:14.180 --> 15:22.200
And their conclusion was that the Ringworld's worst problem is that all the top soil would wind up in the oceans in about 3,000 years.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.160
There are no earthquakes on the Ringworld.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.460
No mountain building forces.

15:34.780 --> 15:39.960
But in a sequel, Ringworld engineers, Niven attempted to correct such deficiencies.

15:40.420 --> 15:43.600
He devised a way to answer the criticism of the Florida high schoolers.

15:45.780 --> 15:47.380
Okay, that's a tough one.

15:47.520 --> 15:58.120
I set up a spill pipe system that runs the bottom from the sea bottoms under the Ringworld and up over the edge of the Ringworld.

16:00.000 --> 16:09.940
That even allows you some, uh, some mines accumulation of useful metals.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.460
Fan response of that sort caused Ringworld engineers to be written.

16:23.460 --> 16:30.720
And although Niven once said he wouldn't write anymore in the Known Space series, the body of stories to which Ringworld belongs, he's not so sure anymore.

16:32.240 --> 16:37.640
I've given up saying that the, uh, that the Known Space series is daily.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.840
There's just no point in it.

16:39.960 --> 16:44.440
I've written five books worth of Known Space stories since I said that.

16:45.140 --> 16:46.300
More on Larry Niven tomorrow.

16:53.460 --> 17:02.180
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:41.680 --> 17:45.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:02.020 --> 18:07.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.820
And here are your hosts.

18:16.580 --> 18:17.840
This is Daryl Lane.

18:18.060 --> 18:18.740
And David Carson.

18:19.180 --> 18:22.120
Larry Niven is one of the best-selling authors in the field of science fiction.

18:22.120 --> 18:28.580
A fairly large portion of his work falls into the Known Space series, a group of stories and novels with a consistent chronology.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.980
Such a series is called a Future History.

18:31.740 --> 18:36.080
Niven believes there are some peculiar attractions a Future History has for a science fiction author.

18:36.840 --> 18:43.480
There had been Future Histories around, uh, Poole Anderson and, uh, Robert Heinlein.

18:45.560 --> 18:51.840
And I tell you, I guess we each evolved the idea somewhat independently.

18:52.140 --> 19:00.920
And the idea is that if you carved out a consistent, workable future, it seems a shame to waste it on one story.

19:02.260 --> 19:10.720
You put in the background because you want the, uh, you want the background of a story to seem bigger than it is.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.160
So there are things that are simply unexplained.

19:14.620 --> 19:19.640
And if you think of more to say on a given subject, why you go with it.

19:19.800 --> 19:26.320
And if you think of a story that fits into the background of a previous story and allows you to elaborate on that background,

19:26.820 --> 19:28.920
sometimes you fall in love with the background.

19:29.580 --> 19:32.040
And presently you've got a bunch of stories that link.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.700
Niven has also written some bestselling books that fall outside his known space series.

19:48.260 --> 19:54.680
Three of these, The Mote in God's Eye, Lucifer's Hammer, and Oath of Fieldty were written in collaboration with Jerry Purnell.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.200
We asked Niven how he and Purnell collaborate.

19:58.380 --> 20:02.000
Hard sometimes, but it always resolved.

20:02.720 --> 20:09.480
The question is who is more, who is most qualified to write a given scene that we have both decided needs writing.

20:10.060 --> 20:13.060
Before we start, we have the novel all laid out.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.080
We know what's going in virtually everywhere.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.280
And if we don't, it feels like we do.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.760
And if we find out we don't, we elaborate as we get to that section.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.620
Okay, the next question is who is qualified to write a given scene.

20:28.820 --> 20:29.800
Sometimes it's obvious.

20:30.740 --> 20:33.020
If we're dealing with a madman, he's mine.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.240
If we're dealing with military operations, it's Jerry's.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.560
Aliens are generally mine.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.760
Politics is generally Jerry's.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.560
Knowledge of history generally Jerry's.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.200
And a real evil son of a bitch, Jerry usually creates him and I usually run with him afterwards.

21:03.240 --> 21:06.340
Niven occasionally writes science fiction humor, rarity.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.760
He talks about his most successful piece of humor.

21:09.680 --> 21:18.360
I suppose I could name old man of steel woman of queen eggs, which has gotten me the most laughs.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.640
I suppose everybody seems to have read it.

21:21.760 --> 21:24.400
Those who haven't heard about it are cocktail parties.

21:25.660 --> 21:34.700
Niven's ready eye for humor can also be appreciated as he reveals that he's detected one of his own alien creations from Ringworld, the Pearson's puppeteer here on Earth.

21:35.740 --> 21:38.860
I have reason to suspect that there are puppeteers on Earth.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.380
Look at the characteristics.

21:42.360 --> 21:42.940
Forget the shape.

21:42.940 --> 21:47.640
They must be masters of biology that hide that peculiar three-legged two-headed shape.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.300
But consider their characteristics.

21:50.620 --> 21:51.420
They are cowards.

21:52.980 --> 21:55.560
That is, they want everything utterly safe.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.740
No corners on anything.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.820
Everything is soft surfaces around the puppeteer world.

22:01.700 --> 22:09.140
They don't even keep their world near a sun regarding it as a runaway fusion reactor, which of course it is.

22:10.740 --> 22:26.340
So, desperate regard for safety, they plus an urge to meddle in the lifestyles of other species, driving urge to meddle with practically no restraints attached.

22:27.060 --> 22:28.240
What does that remind you of?

22:28.560 --> 22:32.100
It seems nearly certain to me that Ralph Nader is a Pearson's puppeteer.

22:39.320 --> 22:48.020
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:30.460 --> 23:34.500
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:50.620 --> 23:56.000
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.380
And here are your hosts.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.180
This is Bill Vernon.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.220
And Darrell Lane.

24:07.220 --> 24:16.600
Ever since Hugo Gernsback published the first Science Fiction magazine in 1926, amazing stories, Science Fiction has been separated from other kinds of literature.

24:17.240 --> 24:20.680
And many people, both fans and authors, have been satisfied with that separation.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.880
They like the special feeling of belonging to something distinct and even unique.

24:25.520 --> 24:38.420
But others feel that the separation of science fiction from general literature, sometimes referred to as mainstream literature, is artificial and even harms science fiction because it keeps it a second-class genre that's not treated seriously.

24:39.140 --> 24:46.720
We spoke with Dr. Krippal Singh, Science Fiction Scholar and Critic, at the 1981 World Science Fiction Convention in Denver on this subject.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.960
Dr. Singh teaches Science Fiction at the National University of Singapore.

24:51.640 --> 24:56.060
He has some strong ideas on science fiction and its relationship to mainstream literature.

24:56.880 --> 25:11.440
I think ultimately the distinctions ought to disappear, frankly, because the more we try to erect these boundaries, the more we get into troubled waters.

25:11.440 --> 25:16.320
And that's the distinctions, because as we all know, categories are, by their very nature, exclusive.

25:17.100 --> 25:29.420
And when they become too exclusive, as I think the case has been with science fiction for a long time, what develops is the hightest, and that could lead to a breakdown in communication rather than an integration.

25:29.420 --> 25:50.540
And I think one of the reasons why perhaps science fiction has not quite enjoyed the kind of status that it ought to as a valid and viable form of literature in our time, is the fact that too often, and by too many people, it has been very zealously and jealously guarded as something exclusive,

25:51.200 --> 25:56.460
something that one entered with a great deal of trepidation, things like that.

25:56.820 --> 26:03.940
So yes, I think ultimately there has to be an elimination of the categories. As Brian already says, science fiction is literature.

26:04.960 --> 26:09.880
Some of Dr. Singh's ideas on why science fiction has been kept separate are probably a bit controversial.

26:10.320 --> 26:15.420
We asked him, for instance, if readers or fans of science fiction are partly responsible for its isolation.

26:16.440 --> 26:23.820
Yes, I think fans to a large extent explain the exclusiveness as we are witnessing in this world, convention here in Denver itself.

26:25.220 --> 26:33.320
One of the things that I notice most readily is the fact that a lot of the fans are not really, I think, very keen on a serious discussion of science fiction.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.840
They're here to have a good time, and that's a very good thing in itself. I mean, I think people ought to have a good time.

26:38.840 --> 26:46.940
But at the same time, they mustn't then go on and complain that, oh, you know, we are regarded as freaks, as people on our own individual trips,

26:47.000 --> 26:52.400
because I think in some ways we SF enthusiasts invite that kind of charge or accusation.

26:53.420 --> 26:57.500
I also feel that a lot of the science fiction writers are themselves responsible for this.

26:58.820 --> 27:06.320
I've talked personally with a number of them, and I've heard many of them speaking and I've read a lot, what they have said in fanzines and things.

27:06.320 --> 27:15.640
They do want to keep this kind of thing going because the science fiction writers feel that they are commercially viable only insofar as they have got a large fan following.

27:16.180 --> 27:19.340
And if they have a large fan following, then they feel that they can sell.

27:20.160 --> 27:29.980
Now, the same writers also lament the fact that serious critics at the universities, in colleges and all, are not taking them seriously.

27:29.980 --> 27:35.500
But I want to question that because to a large extent, I think it's part of their own making.

27:36.240 --> 27:43.960
And they don't put enough effort and serious struggle into the work, and therefore the outcome of it is quite mediocre, to say the least.

27:44.700 --> 27:46.720
Does he think science fiction should change?

27:47.980 --> 27:52.140
Yes, I mean, you know, and this is why so much of science fiction becomes obsolete.

27:52.860 --> 28:08.260
There's too much attention, too much ostentatious attention paid to scientific detail, scientific accuracy, new technological breakthroughs and things so that the imagination, I think, is set up by the facts rather than fiction.

28:08.540 --> 28:11.080
So that what happens in science fiction is the science takes over the fiction.

28:11.880 --> 28:15.060
And to be established as literature, I think it's the fiction that needs to prevail.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.220
Controversial ideas, certainly, but also thought-provoking ones.

28:27.940 --> 28:36.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
