00:02.740 --> 00:03.740
Yeah, the tape is running.

00:03.940 --> 00:05.000
Okay, and listen, um...

00:06.420 --> 00:06.960
Any questions?

00:07.260 --> 00:12.420
Yeah, if I should ask a question you don't understand or it's a dumb question or you

00:12.420 --> 00:15.600
want to just take a drink of water or something, go ahead and just stop because we can edit

00:15.600 --> 00:16.460
that whole thing out.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.120
No problem.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.240
Okay, thanks a lot.

00:19.960 --> 00:23.860
Okay, I guess the first question I would have is just to ask you.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.820
I guess you've been writing since a very early age, haven't you?

00:26.820 --> 00:32.400
Well, I'm told that I started dictating poems to my mother before I could print, but it's

00:32.400 --> 00:34.660
true that I've been writing for school papers and things.

00:34.760 --> 00:41.060
I started making up stories, poems, and songs since, uh, well, it was well before I entered

00:41.060 --> 00:47.000
school, but I didn't start writing with any connected ambition until I was about 12 or

00:47.000 --> 00:47.380
13.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.580
Okay, did you, uh, did you read science fiction magazines and so forth as an adolescent or

00:54.580 --> 00:54.960
a youngster?

00:55.600 --> 00:57.800
Well, I, uh, I read more books.

00:58.320 --> 01:02.720
There were a cosh of old, archacy old stories at the house because my father read them,

01:02.960 --> 01:06.540
but though there were some weird tales around, my mother wouldn't let me read them because

01:06.540 --> 01:08.740
she was convinced they'd give me terminal nightmares.

01:09.500 --> 01:16.040
So I, uh, didn't discover science fiction magazines until I was 16 or so, but I had read

01:16.040 --> 01:22.520
Ryder Haggard, Talbot Monde, uh, People of that sort, Nelson Bond in the old archacy,

01:22.520 --> 01:25.360
that sort of thing, adventure fantasies, it worked.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.900
I remember when I finally got hold of the Talbot Monde's Gimbrim, which is one of the

01:30.900 --> 01:36.460
better sort of vaguely science fictional fantasies, somewhat like A. Merritt's, I discovered

01:36.460 --> 01:41.640
that I had read the middle part of it in a serial in Archacy and had only read that part

01:41.640 --> 01:45.240
of it and was fascinated to find out what went before and what came after.

01:47.260 --> 01:51.860
Okay, and I believe your, um, your first published story was sometime when you were in college,

01:51.860 --> 01:52.360
wasn't it?

01:53.300 --> 01:59.020
No, when I was in college, I started getting, I started getting published in fanzines, but

01:59.020 --> 02:04.120
I had actually left college and moved to Texas when my first story was published in a professional

02:04.120 --> 02:04.740
magazine.

02:05.300 --> 02:10.760
It was a, an amateur story contest and from amazing stories.

02:11.760 --> 02:19.940
They bought it and, uh, that was sort of a, a spur to my ambition, but I didn't get anything

02:19.940 --> 02:25.320
published in a professional magazine after that for real money until I was around, uh, 22.

02:27.820 --> 02:31.360
Okay, do you remember the, um, the title of your first published story?

02:31.780 --> 02:37.540
Yes, it was called Keyhole and it was in a magazine called Vortex, which died about a year later.

02:39.100 --> 02:45.400
Okay, um, maybe just one more question on this, on your origins as a science fiction writer.

02:45.400 --> 02:51.000
Um, this may sound like sort of a dumb question, but why would you, why did you pick science

02:51.000 --> 02:54.300
fiction and science fantasy as a, your major field of writing?

02:54.880 --> 02:59.740
Well, I, uh, have never been able to answer that question satisfactorily, even to myself.

03:00.300 --> 03:04.240
I started out by saying that I wanted to, excuse me a moment, please.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.140
Lisa, get the phone!

03:09.680 --> 03:10.300
Okay, dear.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.180
Yeah, that's no trouble.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.460
Sorry about that.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.120
That's no trouble.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.840
I had to ask my roommate to get the other phone.

03:16.040 --> 03:20.280
Well, when I was a child, I thought that if I wanted to grow up and be a writer,

03:20.460 --> 03:24.600
I would probably write historical fiction because that was what I liked best at that time,

03:25.120 --> 03:29.520
although I always loved things like writer Haggard, but they were in such old books that I decided

03:29.520 --> 03:31.100
they weren't being published anymore.

03:31.880 --> 03:37.820
Then when I discovered the new, uh, uh, the pulp magazines, The Stounding, Threeling Wander,

03:37.960 --> 03:44.160
that sort of thing, and I saw the fan magazines in the back, the fan scenes and the letters from fans,

03:44.160 --> 03:48.440
I thought, my goodness, there are other people who like this sort of thing, and I,

03:48.700 --> 03:51.760
all of a sudden, I realized not only that I wanted to write for a living,

03:51.880 --> 03:54.600
but that I wanted to write science fiction and fantasy.

03:56.820 --> 03:57.500
Okay, good.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.580
In reading your work, I'm sure you've been asked this before, and I'm not sure if it's

04:04.580 --> 04:10.960
the question you find easy to answer, but obviously you do use, uh, themes having to do with telepathy

04:10.960 --> 04:15.740
or parapsychology or ESP. It plays a big part in your work, and I wondered why that was so

04:15.740 --> 04:16.480
interesting to you.

04:16.920 --> 04:23.020
Well, possibly because, as I said before, I began my reading with such people as writer Haggard,

04:23.660 --> 04:32.520
Merritt, um, Andrew Lang, Yates, uh, the Dunsaney people, the Sirius Fantasy writers,

04:32.820 --> 04:37.860
and they, of course, were all roughly connected, which I found out later, to the Golden Dawn

04:37.860 --> 04:40.040
Order, the magical order in England.

04:41.140 --> 04:48.100
Also, there was a lot of, there's a lot of, uh, of history. Fantasy sort of comes out of

04:48.100 --> 04:52.740
occultism, as it were, and the, what's now called the Neopagan religions, but of course,

04:52.800 --> 04:57.620
they didn't exist at that time. So I thought I was the only person interested in these things,

04:58.060 --> 05:03.040
and when I got into Haggard, Monday, people like that, I realized this is,

05:03.780 --> 05:07.720
this is what I was looking for. There are a lot of people, I think, who look in science fiction

05:07.720 --> 05:12.140
and fantasy for validation of the fact that there are other things in life than,

05:12.640 --> 05:18.420
than you might say, the mundane round and materialism, and those of us who can't get

05:18.420 --> 05:22.860
into conventional religion, which I've never been able to do for various and sundry reasons,

05:23.400 --> 05:30.880
uh, we use that, I think, as a way of looking for what was real in religion behind the dogma

05:30.880 --> 05:37.020
and behind the, uh, all the nonsense and hellfire. That may be a very unpopular answer in the

05:37.020 --> 05:42.540
Bible, though, I'm sorry. No, that's excellent. I happen to agree with that myself, but by the

05:42.540 --> 05:46.900
way, our show is, uh, probably most of the stations that have picked us up are not in Texas

05:46.900 --> 05:52.520
any how, a lot of them back east and so forth, so. Not that I don't like Texas, it's just that I did

05:52.520 --> 05:58.240
have trouble with churchgoers. They thought I was a terribly impious person. Yeah, I know, I'm not a

05:58.240 --> 06:02.540
native Texan either. I have the same trouble. Um, well, listen, one more question on that. Do you

06:02.540 --> 06:07.640
think, um, do you think that such things, you know, as the, uh, the ESP or the telepathy, whatever,

06:07.760 --> 06:11.460
do you think that there is, this is, this is possible that there is evidence that it doesn't

06:11.460 --> 06:15.760
exist? Oh, I know perfectly well it's possible. I've had experience with it myself, haven't you?

06:17.560 --> 06:22.620
Yeah, maybe a little clairvoyance or things like that. Well, I am a, I am a natural psychic,

06:23.440 --> 06:28.380
and when I was able to get into contact with other people who had been in these things seriously,

06:28.820 --> 06:32.440
as I read about them, I wrote about them, and sooner or later, of course, I was,

06:32.520 --> 06:37.160
people communicated with me who had experience in these things and could train me in them.

06:39.180 --> 06:46.140
Okay, that's fine. Um, I'm gonna have to ask you some questions. I suppose you know about Darkover.

06:46.260 --> 06:52.400
I assume you've been Darkover to death, but, uh, I still really love Darkover. How many,

06:52.400 --> 06:59.120
how many novels has that reached now? I think that there are 15 novels and two anthologies.

07:00.480 --> 07:05.460
And I have all 15 been published, or there are some that aren't out yet? Uh, well, there are the

07:05.460 --> 07:10.820
latest one called Hawkmistress. I have seen the cover print, which means it's in the production

07:10.820 --> 07:15.220
process, but it won't be on the stands for a few months. I'm not sure of the absolute date.

07:16.260 --> 07:22.240
That's called Hawkmistress? Hawkmistress. And I've signed a contract for two more Darkover books,

07:23.260 --> 07:28.760
and one is called Tandara House. It's a sequel to Shattered Chain and tells about the heroine of

07:28.760 --> 07:35.900
Shattered Chain, Magda, among the three Amazons. And the third one is the, the next one is called

07:35.900 --> 07:42.620
The City of the Sorceresses. And, uh, for the first time, it goes outside the area defined on Darkover

07:42.620 --> 07:47.860
by what's called the wall around the world and takes some unmapped parts of the planet into

07:47.860 --> 07:54.920
consideration. What, uh, what era of Darkover does, uh, does Hawkmistress deal with? Hawkmistress is a

07:54.920 --> 08:00.640
novel of the ages of chaos. It's sometime between Storm Queen and Tutor Conqueror.

08:01.860 --> 08:07.620
Okay, fine. You've, um, you've never really looked at that as a, as a consistent series or a future

08:07.620 --> 08:14.060
history, have you? I started trying to do that around the time I wrote Forbidden Tower. Uh,

08:14.060 --> 08:20.300
originally no. Uh, I had a feeling, and other writers told me rather cynically, that the life

08:20.300 --> 08:26.960
of a paperback book was about five or six months that nobody, and so I assumed, I realized it was

08:26.960 --> 08:33.420
not safe to assume that anyone who read any of my books had ever read a previous book or would

08:33.420 --> 08:39.180
ever read another book by me. So I worked very hard to make each book stand on its own feet and not

08:39.180 --> 08:46.200
assume any knowledge of previous books. Okay, and also I think, um, I think you've written in a few

08:46.200 --> 08:50.760
places that the, some of the minor inconsistencies that come up, but since these were intended as

08:50.760 --> 08:55.240
separate books, that that's no bother to you at all. That's right. I try very hard to make each

08:55.240 --> 09:01.060
book have its own, or internal consistency and logic, but if the books don't jive with one another,

09:01.060 --> 09:05.640
then the readers are just going to have to use their own imagination to fill in the gaps.

09:07.640 --> 09:12.800
Okay, what about a brief statement on the, uh, the origin behind the idea of dark over the whole thing?

09:13.420 --> 09:19.000
Well, when I was around, uh, 15 or so, I started writing a fantasy novel,

09:19.640 --> 09:26.760
uh, which I put a lot of stuff in from mythology and, uh, ideas that had haunted me since I was a child,

09:27.480 --> 09:35.500
and, um, invented what I thought was the seven telepathic families. And, uh, they were supposed

09:35.500 --> 09:41.140
to be in sort of a lost, uh, alternate world of earth originally, a world where the Spanish

09:41.140 --> 09:47.620
Armada had won and, uh, the new world was Spanish and Indian rather than British and British French

09:47.620 --> 09:54.660
and Spanish and American Indian. And, uh, therefore I sort of went heavily into all that

09:55.340 --> 10:02.620
and then, uh, I realized there was no market for fantasy. So when the whole thing was practically

10:02.620 --> 10:07.100
finished, I shoved it into a drawer and forgot about it. And several years later, it occurred to

10:07.100 --> 10:11.960
me that I could make it into a sort of the same sort of thing that was published in, uh, say,

10:12.060 --> 10:17.860
thrilling wonder stories, amazing stories, the big fantasies by people like Henry Cutner, uh,

10:18.200 --> 10:23.920
which had sort of a thin, or the bracket, which had sort of a thin skin of scientific rationality

10:23.920 --> 10:30.560
by placing them on other planets. So, um, I started to do that with it and the first book,

10:30.800 --> 10:38.900
the sort of Aldoneis, uh, which I completed at about age 19 with another book sort of in the same

10:38.900 --> 10:45.320
theory, uh, Falcons of Narrabedla, one of these was bought by Ray Palmer and the other one was

10:45.320 --> 10:50.520
also bought by Ray Palmer, but he never published it. Then years later, when I'd written a lot of

10:50.520 --> 10:57.320
straightforward, uh, science fiction, Donald Walheim, uh, read the first, you might say, really

10:57.320 --> 11:02.140
interplanetary dark over the planet savers. That was not my title, by the way. I called it Project

11:02.140 --> 11:07.840
Jason, liked it and they asked if I had another book on the same subject. Don is sort of the person

11:07.840 --> 11:13.620
who loves to discover and build up new writers. And, uh, I think he realized even though, through

11:13.620 --> 11:19.040
those very crude early works that maybe I could write something, uh, you know, publishable and good

11:19.040 --> 11:24.680
someday. Okay, fine. Yeah, we talked to Donald Walheim not too long ago. Interviewed him is very

11:24.680 --> 11:32.460
interesting, man. He's a great guy. Um, why do you come back to dark over so often? Well, it started

11:32.460 --> 11:38.740
originally from laziness. I was going to college, putting myself through college and, uh, then later,

11:38.960 --> 11:42.920
so the supporting is say, husband and a couple of children when I married for the second time.

11:43.460 --> 11:48.920
And, uh, my husband was quite ill and couldn't work much and, uh, the babies were still in

11:48.920 --> 11:53.220
diapers and it was the only job I could take that would let me stay home and look after them.

11:53.680 --> 11:58.460
Because, well, it was really too early to cope with the, with that. So I figured if I could sell

11:58.460 --> 12:02.380
books, um, while I was putting myself through college, I could certainly do it while I was

12:02.380 --> 12:10.000
home looking after the kids. And so, um, I started writing and when you have a nice setting in

12:10.000 --> 12:16.140
background, which is fully worked out, the stark over was for me, well, you tend to go back to it

12:16.140 --> 12:20.700
rather than trying to invent a whole new world partly because it's easy and partly because

12:20.700 --> 12:25.900
you realize you haven't, the books are tailored in those days. The books were tailored to such

12:25.900 --> 12:31.780
close commercial restrictions about length and so forth that I realized every time that I'd had to

12:31.780 --> 12:36.460
cut out so much from my own thinking about the book that what I'd cut out would make a sizeable

12:36.460 --> 12:42.540
new book and it was a lot simpler. I figured that since people would read lots of books about

12:42.540 --> 12:48.620
Tarzan or Perry Mason or Nero Wolfe or whatever, people evidently liked reading about stories

12:48.620 --> 12:52.920
with the same background. It was easier to write them than to invent a whole new universe for each

12:52.920 --> 13:01.060
book. That is, as I say at the beginning, it was, it was laziness. Then later, I wanted to get,

13:01.100 --> 13:06.440
give up the whole thing because I thought people must be getting tired of it. And, uh, I told them

13:06.440 --> 13:11.240
John Walheim this and he said, oh no, uh, people are always asking when is there going to be another

13:11.240 --> 13:17.580
book about dark over? And so I decided, good heavens, if it really is a series, maybe I ought to

13:17.580 --> 13:25.040
start thinking of it as a series and take it seriously that way. Okay, excellent. Um, I would

13:25.040 --> 13:29.980
personally take the overall theme of the books as just a conflict between two cultures, you know,

13:30.060 --> 13:35.060
the earth culture and the dark over one, you know, the biggest kind of conflict I see. Of course,

13:35.060 --> 13:39.360
the earth would be technological and imperialistic and so forth and dark over would be more

13:39.360 --> 13:44.660
individual and, um, I don't know, with their telepathic powers, it would be anti-technological

13:44.660 --> 13:50.560
and so forth because of the compact. I don't think so much anti-technological as, uh, thinking that

13:50.560 --> 13:57.060
perhaps there are better ways to do things than by technology. It isn't so much anti-technological as a,

13:57.340 --> 14:02.900
a, a concept that possibly the same kind of technology does not fit every planet,

14:02.900 --> 14:07.520
just as materialism does not fit every human mind, that there are different universes

14:07.520 --> 14:14.640
for different, uh, mental sex as, as you said. I think I'm, I'm a very sort of alternative

14:14.640 --> 14:20.040
culture person myself and I, from the time I was a child, I have never liked the idea

14:20.040 --> 14:26.560
that everybody has to fit into the same lockstep and be, well, they'd now say be clones of my

14:26.560 --> 14:31.300
daughter calls the ordinary kids at school who never think of anything except football games,

14:31.300 --> 14:37.200
clones. Well, I, I felt that way when I was a youngster and so I suppose the idea of leaving

14:37.200 --> 14:42.980
open options and choices for everybody so they can find the kind of lifestyle that suits them best

14:42.980 --> 14:48.600
instead of blambly assuming that everybody has to belong to the same lifestyle. That was something

14:48.600 --> 14:52.860
that I felt very strongly about when I was a kid and I feel even more strongly about than I did

14:52.860 --> 14:58.860
when I was 15. Okay, yeah, I shouldn't have said anti-technological. I wasn't quite fair, but

14:58.860 --> 15:04.400
I would say in my impression, I'm not sure this is correct or not, but you do an even-handed job

15:04.400 --> 15:08.840
most of the time I think in presenting this conflict between the two cultures, but I tend to

15:08.840 --> 15:14.060
think you side with dark over. Would that be right? No, it would not. My very life is dependent on

15:14.060 --> 15:21.040
technology. I am myself a diabetic and dependent upon medical preparations which are very difficult

15:21.040 --> 15:27.100
to get in an anti-techno or a non-technological culture. It is simply that I like, I do what you

15:27.100 --> 15:35.420
call an even-handed job because, well, my husband says it's because I'm a Gemini and it's true that

15:35.420 --> 15:40.420
I am cursed with seeing two sides of everything. When I was a kid and reading in school about what

15:40.420 --> 15:46.000
a terrible person Benedict Arnold was, I still realized that to the British he was a hero and it

15:46.000 --> 15:51.280
suddenly occurred to me that the villain is always, except for really real criminals like mass

15:51.280 --> 15:58.300
murderers, rapists, that sort of thing. Almost every quote a villain unquote is just the victim of a

15:58.300 --> 16:07.020
political conflict. He's the hero of the other side. Okay, what about the compact though? I really

16:07.020 --> 16:11.520
thought you were in sympathy with the compact where you know you couldn't, you couldn't fight somebody.

16:11.740 --> 16:16.720
In this day and age with nuclear weapons every place, I think every human being has to be in

16:16.720 --> 16:20.120
sympathy with the compact or if they aren't there's something wrong with their brains.

16:20.760 --> 16:26.100
At least under the compact if you have only a sword or a knife you can do only one person's,

16:26.100 --> 16:31.620
one person's amount of damage. I suppose it's my emotional reaction to the fact that when I was

16:31.620 --> 16:37.440
15 years old it became possible to wipe out all human life on earth if one paranoid, paranoid

16:37.440 --> 16:43.520
politician presses the wrong button. And I think maybe that's too much power and would like to see

16:43.520 --> 16:50.660
power back back in the hands of individuals over their own lives. I don't like the idea that we are

16:50.660 --> 16:59.240
all, you might say, hostages in a monstrous political and ideological conflict. I can't believe that

16:59.240 --> 17:08.520
God is on one side and that on the other there is only the devil. Okay, good. I was pleased a little

17:08.520 --> 17:12.020
while ago to hear you mention that you're writing a sequel to the Shattered Chain. That's I think my

17:12.020 --> 17:20.060
favorite Dark Overbook. Have some fans overreacted to the feminism of that with the idea of the free

17:20.060 --> 17:28.460
Amazons? As a matter of fact, the real heavy feminists believe that I'm sort of a pussycat,

17:28.540 --> 17:35.960
a Mickey Mouse, because I don't go far enough in men hating. They said I didn't have the courage to go

17:35.960 --> 17:41.480
far enough and create a society where men had actually been eliminated, a true feminist society.

17:42.020 --> 17:48.340
But my attitude is always that's pure fantasy. Men are here and they're going to stay. And the fact

17:48.340 --> 17:54.120
that I don't like some men or the way some men act or even the system under which they live

17:54.120 --> 17:59.500
doesn't mean that I am going to give up relationships with the nice men I found,

17:59.580 --> 18:05.360
with the father of my children, with my grown sons, my brothers and so forth. I think men are very

18:05.360 --> 18:13.340
fine people. I think people are people, but the system of Dark Over has people used to ask me why

18:13.340 --> 18:19.560
the system of Dark Over was so hard on women. And I suppose I looked back historically and realized

18:19.560 --> 18:28.120
that it was, yes, simply because of like as with all pioneers societies, the women get the

18:28.120 --> 18:36.220
ground of it. So like for instance, life among the Eskimos or Tibetans is harder on women too,

18:36.280 --> 18:42.400
in many ways. So I think that possibly the free Amazons were created when I wanted to try

18:43.880 --> 18:53.440
and scratch that. I think the free Amazons were created out of my wish to realize that in a society

18:53.440 --> 18:58.160
so abnormally restrictive, there must be some kind of a safety valve where the society would

18:58.160 --> 19:03.540
blow to pieces. So there had to be some kind of an honorable alternative provided in the society

19:03.540 --> 19:08.440
for women and for that matter for men who simply could not live under the pressures of that kind

19:08.440 --> 19:16.800
of society. Okay. The oath of the free Amazons, did that come fresh out of your mind or was any

19:16.800 --> 19:22.440
kind of origin or impetus behind that? As a matter of fact, it was sort of spontaneous. I was writing

19:22.440 --> 19:27.240
along in the story and I had the slightest idea what was going to happen until Magda ran into the

19:27.240 --> 19:31.340
free Amazons and I thought, well, what would they do to her? What would they do? They certainly

19:31.340 --> 19:35.840
wouldn't kill her because they're peaceful people. And then it suddenly occurred to me, the penalty

19:36.360 --> 19:43.680
for passing yourself off as an Amazon might be to be forced into actually observing their laws.

19:44.700 --> 19:51.920
And so also it was in a way a literary device to get Magda among them to explore it,

19:52.480 --> 20:00.380
explore it from the heroine's eye. But I found myself suddenly just writing down the oath. I

20:00.380 --> 20:05.160
didn't figure it out beforehand. I just said, now what would this group of people do to the

20:05.160 --> 20:12.600
end of people who came among them and that sort of just poured out? Okay, good. Maybe just one

20:12.600 --> 20:19.220
more question on that book. I think it's Rohana, the Lady Rohana, Rohana. I thought she stated

20:19.220 --> 20:22.940
her position very well, even though she could sympathize with the free Amazon, she had still

20:22.940 --> 20:27.540
freely chosen to be married and to take up the family life and so forth. I thought you had a

20:27.540 --> 20:32.680
great deal of sympathy with that position. Of course I do because I lived in a world where

20:32.680 --> 20:40.560
these restrictions became part of our lives and it's quite, a lot of, for instance, very liberated

20:40.560 --> 20:47.840
women. I would like very much to join them in many ways, but having taken on responsibilities,

20:47.840 --> 20:55.020
my kids are here. I can't just, you can't divorce your children. You can't take back the

20:55.020 --> 21:01.620
commitments you've made. It's also true that this kind of freedom is not for everybody. I,

21:01.720 --> 21:06.460
for instance, would absolutely love to sail single-handed around the world or climb Mount Everest,

21:07.040 --> 21:14.220
but I had children until I was too old to do so and nowadays there is really no great reason for me

21:16.160 --> 21:23.400
to strike out and do this. I have a great deal of sympathy and admiration for people who can do

21:23.400 --> 21:28.780
these things, but I can't. Just as I think Rohana had a great deal of admiration for the free Amazon,

21:29.360 --> 21:34.540
her attitude is, well, if I had known about this kind of thing when I was a young girl, instead of

21:35.440 --> 21:40.020
just believing all sorts of lies about them, I probably would have been one too, but it's too

21:40.020 --> 21:45.080
late for that. I had another, you might say that God had meant something else for me.

21:47.140 --> 21:53.980
Okay, what's your reaction to the fan response to Darko? It's been a great response and I

21:53.980 --> 21:57.640
wondered if you ever write books or continue it simply because of fan response.

21:58.440 --> 22:04.460
In a sense I do. I sort of keep a pulse out of what fans are interested in and sometimes when

22:04.460 --> 22:10.440
they bring up a question and discuss it, I don't deliberately write a book to answer this discussion.

22:10.620 --> 22:15.740
It's just that the discussion makes me think and obviously the results of that thought come out

22:15.740 --> 22:22.680
in my writing. No writer works in a vacuum. Some people read science fiction writers read

22:22.680 --> 22:29.480
Scientific American and Discovery in the Smithsonian magazine to find out what's going on in modern

22:29.480 --> 22:36.220
science and thought and then extrapolate from that. I am much more into psychology than I am into

22:36.220 --> 22:43.920
high technology sciences and new advances in medicine and in psychology and psychiatry,

22:43.980 --> 22:52.520
in which fields I read very widely, make me feel now how would this be optimally used in the

22:52.520 --> 22:58.920
society or even sometimes how could this be misused in the society and as a result I tend to come

22:58.920 --> 23:03.620
up with a new book. Everything that goes into a writer's head sooner or later comes out of it in the book.

23:05.220 --> 23:13.180
Right okay. What's your, I don't know, how do your fans communicate with you? What's your

23:13.180 --> 23:17.260
relationship with them? Do they have a regular correspondence with you or do you just meet them

23:17.260 --> 23:22.240
at conventions? Well I meet them at conventions. There's an organization called the Friends of

23:22.240 --> 23:28.300
Darkover and although I didn't have a great deal to do with it, I haven't had a great deal to do

23:28.300 --> 23:33.940
with it for a long time, I meet with these people, I answer their questions, I enjoy talking to them

23:33.940 --> 23:39.240
because in general the people who like darkover are people who think along the same lines that I do

23:39.240 --> 23:44.680
and on the same subjects that I do. Therefore it's interesting to me to talk to them for their own

23:44.680 --> 23:49.660
sakes, not just because they admire my books but because in general people who read my books are

23:49.660 --> 23:54.500
the kind of people who are thinking along the same lines that I am, the subjects I speak of are of

23:54.500 --> 24:01.180
interest to them. Okay before I leave that particular topic of fans, I've always been impressed by the

24:02.940 --> 24:06.860
there seems to me something unique in the field of science fiction and fantasy and that's the

24:06.860 --> 24:10.860
interaction between the authors and the fans. I don't think in any other field of literature is it

24:10.860 --> 24:15.820
so so strong or is there such an interplay between writers and fans? Would you agree with that?

24:17.520 --> 24:24.780
There are certain kinds of people who become terribly emotionally involved in soap operas,

24:25.740 --> 24:29.640
actresses who play unpleasant characters in soaps for instance have been

24:29.640 --> 24:36.880
having yelled at and had their face slapped in public for being so nasty and it's also true that

24:36.880 --> 24:44.400
some of the romance writers fans, romance writers tend to communicate with each other and to keep

24:44.400 --> 24:51.080
in touch with their fans but it's not on a very high intellectual level whereas I think one of the

24:51.080 --> 24:57.180
things that draws science fiction and fantasy people together is the desire to find other people

24:57.180 --> 25:02.560
who think deeply about the serious things in our lives and that's one thing that distinguishes the

25:02.560 --> 25:07.840
science fiction and fantasy fan. They are thinking very seriously about the meaning of human life.

25:08.460 --> 25:13.400
Science fiction deals with the technological society in which we find ourselves and its various

25:13.400 --> 25:20.640
ramifications and fantasy goes even deeper because it forces us to confront you might say the archetypal

25:20.640 --> 25:29.260
images in our own unconscious. The subconscious mind is very deeply tapped during reading fantasy

25:29.260 --> 25:33.940
so people who read science fiction and fantasy are people who like to think very deeply

25:34.520 --> 25:42.200
in fantasy about ourselves and in science fiction about the world we live in and people who think

25:42.200 --> 25:47.000
about these things are not that common because when you walk along the street the first ten people

25:47.000 --> 25:54.140
you meet are not seeing too much fruit in the latest baseball or football game so when you find

25:54.140 --> 26:00.040
other people who are thinking very serious thoughts about the thoughts that are in your mind all the

26:00.040 --> 26:08.000
time you tend to regard them as in a way family they are people you can talk to they speak your own

26:08.000 --> 26:15.220
language. Okay good let me just go on to another work I'm not going to spend too much time on your

26:15.220 --> 26:19.300
works because you've written so much we just don't have time to cover all of it but another one of my

26:19.300 --> 26:23.960
favorites is the house between the worlds and I wondered if there was any impetus or origin

26:23.960 --> 26:32.360
behind that particular book. Yes there was the I was telegraph avenue was sort of the student hang

26:32.360 --> 26:38.800
out of the of Berkeley and walking up and down telegraph avenue every now and then I saw a very

26:38.800 --> 26:45.060
intriguing little shop which had the old Arthur Rackham prints and fantastic pictures and things in it

26:45.060 --> 26:51.140
but there were times when I couldn't find the damn shop and I kept looking for it and I remembered

26:51.140 --> 26:55.960
that there once in Albany there had been a little shop like that which sometimes I could find it and

26:55.960 --> 27:01.120
sometimes it seemed to be on another street there are streets in Berkeley that seem to clone themselves

27:01.120 --> 27:07.440
as it were I will I will go across Derby Street and then it seems that six blocks later I go across

27:07.440 --> 27:12.840
Derby again and I began wondering you know what universe that thing was in when I couldn't find it

27:13.600 --> 27:17.720
and out of that came the whole fantastic structure of the house between the worlds.

27:18.620 --> 27:23.660
I think I know that print shop or bookshop you mean I've looked for one a little place called

27:23.660 --> 27:29.080
Logos it's on telegraph avenue. Logos I can find this is another place and now it's settled down

27:29.080 --> 27:33.860
and is the printment and I can usually find it but originally I'm convinced it was on the other

27:33.860 --> 27:41.200
side of the street and there were times when it wasn't there at all. Okay. Sort of half convinced

27:41.200 --> 27:46.420
you might say. Yeah okay one of the things that interested me too in the book was the I guess

27:46.420 --> 27:54.240
it's the alfar alfar you call them. You hinted at a relationship between the alfar and humanity I

27:54.240 --> 27:59.240
think one of the I think that one of the alfars said that that we they are our children or something

27:59.240 --> 28:05.860
what was the relationship you envisioned there. Well I'm of course very familiar with Celtic mythology

28:07.000 --> 28:14.020
and among the Irish people they believe that the elves or the she or the people of the hills or

28:14.020 --> 28:19.480
whatever you wish to call them people of the hollow hills the elf people this is also true in

28:19.480 --> 28:26.940
Scandinavian mythology are a race of man who were either more or less involved excuse me more or

28:26.940 --> 28:33.940
less evolved than humanity but they seem to have had a singular relationship with them this is of

28:33.940 --> 28:40.040
course where the Kiarion Darkover came from and I sort of wanted to go into my feelings about the

28:40.680 --> 28:46.780
elf folk. Tolkien acted as if they were sort of an alien race whereas I've always felt that they

28:46.780 --> 28:52.400
may there have been a more primitive form of humanity or another ethnic group which sort of

28:52.400 --> 28:58.620
perished before Atlantis and only small groups have been kept on. I don't say that this is even

28:58.620 --> 29:03.860
remotely scientific not being Eric von Daniken or anything like that it's just that it's a good idea

29:03.860 --> 29:09.960
to play with for fictional purposes. I've always wanted to explore the way in which mankind is

29:09.960 --> 29:14.520
always related to the elf people with mountain people the troll folk in legends.

29:16.780 --> 29:19.820
Okay good listen we're at the end of the tape.
