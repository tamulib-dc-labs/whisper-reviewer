00:01.820 --> 00:02.680
David, have you got rich?

00:02.840 --> 00:05.140
I've got a couple of others, but I think they're out of print now.

00:06.300 --> 00:10.800
Okay, he's got the tape back on. I only have just a few more minutes of material if you don't mind.

00:11.260 --> 00:11.740
All right.

00:14.160 --> 00:22.620
The series that you have been working on now, it looks to me from the dates for about 25 years, the Vyajins Interplanetarius?

00:24.780 --> 00:25.180
Vyajins.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.320
You better say it.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.180
That's how you say it in Portuguese. Vyajins Interplanetarius.

00:34.480 --> 00:34.880
Okay.

00:35.800 --> 00:43.040
But I'm not about to try to give you a lesson in Portuguese. I've been struggling with that damn language myself for a couple of years and not getting very far.

00:45.020 --> 00:53.920
One of my first questions on that was that when you started, I guess the start of that was some short stories that were published in the Continent Makers back in the early 50s, I think.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.920
And the first novel was Queen of Zamba.

00:56.040 --> 01:04.160
The first story of that series, I believe, was the Queen of Zamba, which is published in paperback by Davis now.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.620
Okay, at any rate, that goes back quite a ways.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.460
Then I wrote several short stories also in that setting.

01:12.480 --> 01:16.440
When you started it back then, did you intend for that to be a future history?

01:18.420 --> 01:21.680
Not really, no. I just sort of started it.

01:21.680 --> 01:40.180
Well, let's say that this way, when I was a pimpled adolescent or a high school student, I loved Edgar Rice Borrows's tales of Mars and Venus and devoured them as they came out.

01:41.080 --> 01:51.700
Many years later, when one of my boys got to the age where it was right to read aloud to him, I started reading a princess of Mars.

01:52.160 --> 01:57.660
And every so often I'd say to myself, Geefers, this is lousy writing. I could do much better than that.

01:58.540 --> 02:07.440
Well, I thought, wouldn't it be fun to do John Carter over in modern dress, you might say?

02:07.560 --> 02:25.760
In other words, write a story which, from its basic assumptions, requires a good deal of sword play and things of that sort, a lighthearted adventure on an exotic planet, but be strictly logical about it.

02:25.760 --> 02:37.600
In other words, in Borrows's Mars, they have radium rifles that can shoot 50 miles by radar sight, and still they fool around with swords and spears, which no real people would do.

02:40.240 --> 02:46.520
So, on my planet, they also have swords and spears, and they would like to get guns, but they're not allowed to.

02:47.460 --> 02:54.900
And the various reasons are all duly set forth, and of course they try to get around the prohibition and sometimes succeed.

02:57.140 --> 03:00.980
So I went ahead and wrote the story on that general assumption.

03:02.140 --> 03:08.780
And likewise, I don't have earthmen interbreeding with Christians because their chromosomes wouldn't match.

03:09.820 --> 03:18.140
In fact, that's what the plot of the Hostages Deer turns on, that the local dictator gets his hands on.

03:18.680 --> 03:33.680
This guided tour guide, Dufourcus Reed, and marries him off to his sister at the sword's point, because he knows that then the sister will never bear an heir, you see, who might threaten his power.

03:36.680 --> 03:50.900
Okay, have any of your readers or publishers ever inquired as to if you have an overall plan or a direction for this, like a timeline or anything like that for that series?

03:53.340 --> 04:01.200
Well, as the stories have been written, I've kept a rough chronology as to who was where and hence and when.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.120
And so I try to keep it consistent.

04:03.640 --> 04:09.600
Well, by the way, I never finished telling you, you asked about what sort of person I found Robert Howard to be in my investigation.

04:10.440 --> 04:14.420
Well, everybody knows that Conan is an idealization of Howard.

04:15.220 --> 04:24.300
In other words, the kind of person that Howard thought he would have liked to have been, the ruthless, domineering, footloose, irresponsible adventurer.

04:25.940 --> 04:43.340
Actually, Robert, and with no respect for laws and regulations, actually Robert was just the opposite type, except for hot tempers and chivalrous attitude toward women, they had nothing in common.

04:43.340 --> 05:10.560
Robert Howard was shy, bookish, compassionate, extremely polite, and socially timid, and he's so law abiding that he wouldn't cut across the neighbor's lot even, although everybody else across the lane did.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.900
He was just about as different from the character Conan in the stories as a person could be.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.560
But he still was an idealization, or Conan may have been.

05:22.980 --> 05:23.960
Yes, yes, kind of.

05:24.320 --> 05:35.240
Well, Robert was always talking a lot about how he wished that he thought he'd have been rarely in his element if he'd been born on the Texan frontier in the 19th century,

05:35.240 --> 05:41.100
or in some barbarian society like the ancient Gauls or Goths or somebody.

05:42.220 --> 05:51.440
Well, I think he'd have had a very unpleasant surprise, because it wasn't his temperament at all.

05:51.980 --> 05:54.480
He was a shy bookish introvert.

05:56.640 --> 06:00.120
Do you think he would have gotten married had he lived, or would he have been a bachelor forever?

06:02.180 --> 06:03.780
Would he have gotten married if what?

06:04.020 --> 06:04.940
If he had lived long.

06:04.940 --> 06:05.640
If he had lived.

06:06.420 --> 06:08.400
That is impossible to say.

06:08.640 --> 06:15.760
He had an outsized monkey on his back, and he was doomed from some way back.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.320
He'd planned his suicide ever since he was a little boy.

06:19.900 --> 06:20.120
Mmm.

06:20.660 --> 06:20.920
Yeah.

06:22.320 --> 06:27.260
He told his mother when he was a little kitty that, mama, when you die, I want to die with you.

06:27.880 --> 06:32.580
And the foolish woman, I think, probably sort of giggled and encouraged him.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.520
Oh, I hadn't realized that. I thought it was a sprue of the moment thing.

06:36.520 --> 06:42.900
No, no, no, no. It was long planned, and several people knew about it, but they didn't do anything.

06:44.820 --> 06:57.460
The only thing you could have done with Robert was if you'd gotten him to a good shrink early enough, quite a good many years before he actually killed himself, why something might have been done, but that of course is uncertain.

06:58.180 --> 06:58.640
Mmm-hmm.

06:58.820 --> 06:59.540
Can't even tell.

07:00.780 --> 07:01.500
Excuse me.

07:03.260 --> 07:06.600
Okay, I just had one more question on that series, just to finish that off.

07:09.240 --> 07:22.080
My impression of that series was that that's probably your closest body of work to pure science fiction, in that you know, well, when they travel on spaceships, for instance, you observe the laws of relativity.

07:23.440 --> 07:28.380
I just, I think most of the planets and the stars involved are fairly near ones and so forth.

07:28.940 --> 07:32.060
I wouldn't be wrong in calling that science fiction then, as opposed to science fiction.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.880
Well, no science fiction. There are no supernatural elements in it.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.060
Right. Okay.

07:38.800 --> 07:45.540
All right, just to change it entirely here to sort of wind down, your writing goes back, I guess to what, 38, 37?

07:45.800 --> 07:46.000
Yes.

07:47.480 --> 07:52.360
Which predates even people like Azimov or Heinlein or Van Boat and so forth.

07:52.360 --> 08:00.740
I think I started just about the same time, but he's passed 200 books and I've only had 93 out, so I'm afraid I shall never catch up.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.060
I wouldn't be surprised if you were in second place.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.700
Oh no, there are several people ahead of me like Delray and Silverberg.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.000
Silverberg has more books than you?

08:10.100 --> 08:12.660
Yes, I think he has well over 100.

08:12.980 --> 08:13.640
Hmm, I'm done.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.140
A lot of them are juvenile, so you don't hear about them much.

08:17.460 --> 08:27.580
Well, I was going to ask what it was like to write or to help form, in fact, to form the so-called golden age of science fiction back in the late 30s and through the 40s and so forth.

08:27.700 --> 08:31.440
Well, the problem with golden ages is that you never realized you had one until it's over.

08:32.600 --> 08:32.960
Right.

08:33.220 --> 08:35.700
Although there was just a bunch of young folks trying to make a living.

08:36.960 --> 08:41.240
Okay, so you know, would you have no sense of a fellowship or a special era?

08:41.240 --> 08:44.100
Yes, there was a great deal of camaraderie.

08:44.920 --> 08:53.000
There was a group of about a dozen of the writers and editors who used to get together in New York about once a month,

08:54.180 --> 09:03.040
including John Campbell, Jack Williamson, Henry Kutner, Edmund Hamilton, and Otis Klein.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.500
Let me see.

09:05.640 --> 09:10.240
Oh, I can crank along and I just say I could think of the names of a few others.

09:11.400 --> 09:20.480
And we'd get together and have an evening and talk and talk and talk and end up with usually ice cream and cake.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.340
We were comparatively sober a lot.

09:26.380 --> 09:32.460
In other words, there was no sense that you, as the kinds of writing you were doing, the editors you were working with and so forth,

09:32.460 --> 09:40.300
that you were sort of restructuring or re-pointing the direction of science fiction, anything special in that area?

09:41.380 --> 09:42.420
Oh, I don't know.

09:42.560 --> 09:52.200
I daresay that various ones of us did have their greens and fancies at times and wondered how it was all going to come out

09:52.200 --> 10:01.000
and would this become, would the genre expand and take over the mainstream and various things of that sort?

10:03.180 --> 10:08.000
But as to that mostly, as I said, it was simply a matter of making a living.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.100
How much influence would you say that Campbell had on you?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.180
On me, very great.

10:15.700 --> 10:19.920
I learned a great deal of what I think I know about storytelling from him.

10:21.500 --> 10:31.020
The three main influences on me were Campbell and Pratt and the 1941 session at the Brad Lofreider's conference.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.640
Yes, I did read that.

10:35.240 --> 10:42.420
Well, in relation to Campbell for just a moment, was the influence to such an extent that he would send a story back to you and say,

10:42.440 --> 10:44.180
rewrite it or do this to it?

10:44.180 --> 10:46.240
Yes, yes, you could do that.

10:46.240 --> 10:56.360
But one thing that did not occur between us was his proposing story ideas and having me write them

10:56.360 --> 11:02.160
because I've never been very good at turning other people's ideas into effective stories.

11:03.320 --> 11:12.420
So he may have tried it a few times, but when nothing came of it, why, he, I guess he quit.

11:12.420 --> 11:19.640
I can't think of one story that he proposed and I wrote the story, but then he rejected it.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.060
I finally sold it to one of his competitors.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.860
That was the Ghosts of Melvin Pie.

11:26.160 --> 11:32.680
He suggested a ghost story in which the dead man had had a split personality, so he had two ghosts.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.160
Yes, I read that one. I remember that story.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.280
You mentioned the Brad Lofreider's conference.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.600
What was special about that? Who were the people involved there?

11:43.160 --> 11:49.140
At that time, they had a lot of very good people there who really gave you the lowdown on the notes and bolts of writing

11:49.140 --> 11:51.400
and on the commercial and legal aspect.

11:52.480 --> 11:59.460
Not only Fletcher Pratt, but also Bernard Devoto and William Sloan and several others of that caliber.

12:02.300 --> 12:08.980
Going back to something you said right at the beginning of the interview, you were not really raised as a science fiction fan.

12:08.980 --> 12:12.660
You weren't one of the regular readers of the Pulps and so forth, were you?

12:12.920 --> 12:15.340
I was an intermittent reader, let's say.

12:15.780 --> 12:27.100
I'd been reading it often on ever since Boyhood, but I was never a really heavy, faithful reader in the sense of buying every issue of every magazine.

12:29.180 --> 12:35.640
One thing that's always fascinating to me about science fiction, the reason I mentioned the fans, is the interaction between fans and authors.

12:36.900 --> 12:41.840
Have you had much of a, you know, I don't mean fan mail so much, but have you been influenced?

12:42.400 --> 12:47.500
Have fans asked for things that you've tried to give them? What kind of relationship do you have with your readers?

12:47.520 --> 12:55.560
Well, for the most part, it's been very pleasant, except for some of the more enthusiastic admirers of H.B. Lovecraft,

12:55.560 --> 13:05.420
who have talked over the jolly idea of hitting me in the face with a cherry pie at the first fantasy convention in Providence,

13:06.240 --> 13:11.800
but the volunteer pie thrower got cold feet, fortunately, so we didn't have that problem.

13:13.000 --> 13:13.680
But you've never...

13:13.680 --> 13:23.760
I've been very pleasant, and I do try to answer all the letters I get, except, of course,

13:23.760 --> 13:31.500
for those that are either abusive or by persons of unsound mind or that don't include a return address,

13:31.720 --> 13:33.160
and that happens too sometimes.

13:34.500 --> 13:43.180
And I don't write long letters in reply. Usually it's postcard, but I don't want to fall into H.B. Lovecraft's trap.

13:43.400 --> 13:51.680
He thought he had to write a long, erudite answer in long hand to every letter that he got, and he had to do it within 48 hours.

13:52.460 --> 13:57.840
Result was, his correspondence build up and up, but he was spending most of his waking hours just writing letters.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.500
That's one of the reasons he was so poor all his life.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.580
Has anybody made an effort to collect all those letters and put them together in a volume?

14:06.300 --> 14:09.680
Oh, yes, they've been published in five volumes by Arkham House.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.160
Okay.

14:12.420 --> 14:19.460
They are now. They are available. I think maybe the first two or three are out of print, I'm not sure.

14:19.460 --> 14:22.560
But you can always write Salk City in the ask.

14:23.640 --> 14:32.320
And those are, of course, only a selection because he is believed to have written something like 100,000 letters in the course of his life.

14:35.200 --> 14:46.540
And several thousand of those still survive and are available, either at Brown University or in the archives of Arkham House in Salk City.

14:47.780 --> 14:58.080
I read over 2000 of the things in doing my biography of Lovecraft, and his scribbly long hand got more and more illegible as he got older.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.060
Okay, I just have a couple more.

15:05.620 --> 15:11.620
From your vantage point, having written science fiction, science fantasy for such a long period of time,

15:12.100 --> 15:16.760
as you look around now at the field and compare it to what it was, say, back in the 30s,

15:17.560 --> 15:21.120
what impresses you most? Is it changed that much and what would the changes be?

15:23.100 --> 15:27.000
Qualitatively, I shouldn't say that it has changed very much.

15:28.640 --> 15:35.080
It is a much bigger field, of course, and the number of authors is very much larger.

15:35.080 --> 15:46.120
Although the number of magazines is still about what it was in, let us say, the middle 1930s, only about five or six at any one time.

15:46.740 --> 15:52.420
There had been a couple of booms when the word got around among the publishers that there's gold in them, our hails,

15:52.900 --> 15:57.460
and everybody jumped in and pretty soon there would be 20 or 30 magazines.

15:57.820 --> 16:00.580
But the market was never big enough to support that.

16:00.580 --> 16:08.300
However, while the readership has expanded greatly, most of it, you see, takes the form of reading paperback novels

16:08.300 --> 16:13.200
and paperback collections or short stories, not magazines.

16:14.580 --> 16:17.320
That's been the big change since the Second World War.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.540
You know, there were no such things as American paperbacks between the two world wars.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.340
Sort of a follow-up to that.

16:27.440 --> 16:33.900
We've spoken with some authors, particularly Norman Spinrad, that seem to feel science fiction,

16:34.720 --> 16:39.710
the separation of science fiction and fantasy, say, from so-called mainstream literature, is artificial.

16:40.420 --> 16:43.880
It's done by the publishing industry that it really should be part of the mainstream.

16:45.020 --> 16:46.420
Have you any thoughts on that?

16:46.420 --> 16:52.520
Do you think it deserves a special category or that it should become part of our normal literary currents?

16:52.840 --> 17:01.480
Well, you have to remember that at one time, imaginative fiction, that is science fiction and fantasy, was the mainstream.

17:02.460 --> 17:09.760
Prior to, I think it was about the year 1719, when Defoe published Robinson Crusoe,

17:09.760 --> 17:15.500
there was, practically speaking, no such thing as realistic fiction.

17:16.480 --> 17:21.300
We wanted to scatter the exceptions, but like the first one was Don Quixote,

17:22.260 --> 17:29.720
but by and large, practically all fiction had elements that we should recognize today as science fiction or fantasy,

17:29.900 --> 17:38.040
that is to say ghosts and miracles and marvelous gadgets of one kind or another.

17:38.040 --> 17:44.040
Why the Odyssey is a science fiction and fantasy saga right there,

17:44.280 --> 17:52.160
with the witch, Cersei turning people into pigs and the monsters, Cilla and Correptus, eating ships and so on.

17:54.580 --> 17:55.300
In other words...

17:55.300 --> 18:03.640
Then in the 18th century, realistic fiction came in, you see, and became popular,

18:03.640 --> 18:09.360
and it's grown and grown until it came to be called in the 20th century the mainstream fiction.

18:09.900 --> 18:13.800
But imaginative fiction has kept right, perking along alongside it, and it's still there.

18:15.800 --> 18:16.420
Okay.

18:17.260 --> 18:24.600
As for the classifications, remember that things in the real world exist by themselves,

18:24.900 --> 18:27.980
but the classifications of them are human inventions.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.760
They are artifacts which men make for their own convenience.

18:32.460 --> 18:36.320
And some of them make better sense than others, or are more useful than others,

18:37.400 --> 18:39.480
but they're not part of the laws of nature.

18:42.580 --> 18:42.980
Okay.

18:44.320 --> 18:48.880
This may be not a question that you would care to answer, but it's one that I cannot help asking an author.

18:49.840 --> 18:55.920
Do you have any works as you look back that you're particularly proud of, or that you're particular favorites?

18:57.240 --> 18:58.900
You know, that kind of question.

18:58.900 --> 19:09.060
Well, there are several, but it depends upon a proud of in what way, or remember fondly in what way.

19:09.720 --> 19:17.360
I think probably my work that has accomplished the most was the ancient engineers.

19:18.680 --> 19:26.960
And as for what stories I remember with the greatest pleasure, well, it is a general rule.

19:26.960 --> 19:33.520
I like best the story I just finished, whatever that is, but of course not everybody agrees with that.

19:34.320 --> 19:45.400
For example, this darkness fall has become what they call a classic, that it's been out of, in and out of print steadily now for 40 years,

19:45.900 --> 19:48.680
and I believe it's currently available in paperback.

19:49.480 --> 19:55.140
So I must have done something right, but on the other hand, when I read it nowadays, I'm aware of many places.

19:55.700 --> 19:58.360
There are many things in it that I do differently today.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.520
Poor sentence structure and things of that sort.

20:05.420 --> 20:05.860
Okay.

20:08.320 --> 20:12.320
You mentioned this just a moment ago, but let me just ask you for my last question one more time.

20:12.640 --> 20:17.780
Could you sort of summarize what you're working on now, and what maybe plans you have for books that would be coming up soon?

20:19.700 --> 20:23.700
The Howard Biography, which is in collaboration with my wife.

20:23.700 --> 20:35.340
We had a third collaborator, Dr. Jane Griffin, who was a native of Eastern Texas who knew the Howard Ayers,

20:35.820 --> 20:38.360
and was familiar with that territory.

20:38.540 --> 20:45.340
She was a psychologist and was very much interested in the psychological aspects of Robert Howard's life,

20:45.420 --> 20:49.220
but she died last year ago.

20:51.040 --> 20:57.060
And so, Katherine and I have been working on the book by ourselves since then, and this is my own autobiography.

20:58.580 --> 21:04.060
There is the movie novelization, but whether that will come to pass or not, nobody knows,

21:04.180 --> 21:09.580
because you have to please several different people with quite different ideas as to what they want.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.780
And that's about it for what we are presently working on.

21:17.780 --> 21:22.760
I have another book of light verse called Heroes and Hub Goblins.

21:22.960 --> 21:28.700
I am just sending off the corrected page proofs on that.

21:29.160 --> 21:35.960
And I have one science fiction novel and one fantasy novel planned,

21:36.160 --> 21:40.080
and I believe that the agent has gotten me a contract for the fantasy novel,

21:40.260 --> 21:44.620
so as soon as I get the other things out of the way, I shall have to work on that.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.600
All right, I really can't, I mean I could think of some more things to ask,

21:50.720 --> 21:53.500
but probably that's going to be enough. We've taken enough of your time.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.880
I'm going to give you back to David in just a second.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.300
He's going to give you the details of how we're going to get this taped to you.
