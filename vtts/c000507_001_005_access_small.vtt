WEBVTT

00:01.840 --> 00:05.820
And I'm preparing this for the Science Fiction Oral History Association.

00:07.080 --> 00:12.620
Of course, the oral history tapes on old times are important, but tomorrow morning the events

00:12.620 --> 00:13.660
of today will be history.

00:14.240 --> 00:19.740
I still recall in 1920, when I was in the fifth grade, the feeling of wonder and shock with

00:19.740 --> 00:24.140
which we learned that the eighth graders upstairs were studying World War II from their history

00:24.140 --> 00:24.500
books.

00:25.220 --> 00:28.160
How could something we had just lived through be history?

00:28.160 --> 00:33.740
And I understand that there are people today feeling the same shock at finding that the

00:33.740 --> 00:35.360
sixties are in history books.

00:36.660 --> 00:43.260
Well, out of the wisdoms us learned, I wish to give you this cassette of thoughts and

00:43.260 --> 00:44.920
statements of very recently.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.900
Mostly, they are thoughts I presented at meetings of the little men's, which is to say, the

00:49.900 --> 00:54.200
elves, gnomes, leprechauns, and little men's chowder, marking, and science fiction society,

00:54.620 --> 00:57.260
the source of the invisible little men award.

00:58.360 --> 01:03.180
The organization was named after the social club to which belonged Mr. O'Malley, Barnabas

01:03.180 --> 01:08.480
Farah's fairy godfather, in the comic strip by Cockett Johnson in the days between World

01:08.480 --> 01:10.240
War II and McCarthyism.

01:11.220 --> 01:14.720
It ended then because Johnson was reported to have had a communist past.

01:16.100 --> 01:21.040
The earlier days, the little man published the rotomagnetic digest, of which I have been

01:21.040 --> 01:25.320
told at least one complete set was still extant as recently as a year or two ago.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.180
But I wasn't one of the little men at that time.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.300
These thoughts are much more recent.

01:31.020 --> 01:36.060
There was the time, for instance, that I reviewed Paul Anderson's Homebrew, a collection of

01:36.060 --> 01:40.940
excellent short pieces of which perhaps the most brilliant is, Uncleavy's True Thinking,

01:41.520 --> 01:44.260
in which he translates the atomic theory into English.

01:45.140 --> 01:50.440
I had occasion to comment on his characterization of fascism on page 28 of the book.

01:51.040 --> 01:56.520
I noted that anyone living today should know that the packaging is not the contents and

01:56.520 --> 01:58.220
that the sales pitch is not the product.

01:58.740 --> 02:01.020
Furthermore, we do know what fascism is.

02:01.640 --> 02:07.120
Just as communism is attempts of people living under fuel regimes to move towards democracy

02:07.120 --> 02:12.780
and industrialization, fascism is an effort to stop a people's moves into democracy and

02:12.780 --> 02:14.680
to move them back to a medieval society.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.000
Of course, neither effort can be fully successful.

02:18.940 --> 02:24.120
Shortly after reviewing the book The Early Long, I had occasion to mention my earliest

02:24.120 --> 02:26.060
memory of a work by C. L. Moore.

02:26.900 --> 02:32.280
Since much of the earliest long and the earliest more both appeared in weird tales, this was

02:32.280 --> 02:33.200
entirely appropriate.

02:35.760 --> 02:42.720
Those of you who have read The Early Long may remember that the earliest long was fairly

02:42.720 --> 02:45.460
representative of the usual contents of weird tales.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.620
No evoking of weirdness or horror, just an assertion of it.

02:49.980 --> 02:53.320
No real description, just an assertion of indescribableness.

02:53.900 --> 02:57.760
A heavy reliance on slime and filth and stench and immobilization.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.740
The murkiest of background hidden with the murkiest of prose.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.740
But don't get the idea that all of it was like that.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.240
There was some action prose and some true description.

03:08.820 --> 03:12.500
For me, the high point of that came in September of 1934.

03:13.540 --> 03:18.040
The East Bay Scientific Association was the local branch of the World Fan Organization,

03:18.320 --> 03:20.000
the International Scientific Association.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.280
We met at Aubrey McDermott's house that month, in fact most months.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.360
My copy of Weird Tales hadn't come yet, but Aubrey's had.

03:28.360 --> 03:32.480
He handed it to me, opened, and said, read that story.

03:33.020 --> 03:34.040
So I read it to him.

03:34.620 --> 03:38.160
It was so perfectly written that it simply flowed with no effort on my part.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.420
It was a beautifully clean prose.

03:41.060 --> 03:46.360
Everything was simply told, clear and clean description just told what happened, what

03:46.360 --> 03:50.640
the characters did and said, and what happened to them, and how they destroyed each other.

03:51.380 --> 03:56.100
It was a tale of how a defeated warrior woman escaped from the dungeon of her country castle,

03:56.100 --> 04:00.920
went down a hole in its lowest level, and found there a world with the power of which

04:00.920 --> 04:01.900
she came back and used.

04:02.900 --> 04:06.780
When I finished, the members thought I had been rehearsing to read it so well,

04:07.020 --> 04:08.260
but I'd never seen it before.

04:08.860 --> 04:10.820
It was simply that good a job of writing.

04:11.340 --> 04:12.640
The writer was C. L. Moore.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.980
The story was the Black God's Kiss.

04:15.740 --> 04:18.400
It's now in print in the best of C. L. Moore.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.820
Another note I found in my archives is undated and also takes off from a passage written by Paul.

04:25.500 --> 04:30.060
I probably never before mentioned it to anyone, but because I have used it to comment on the

04:30.060 --> 04:32.580
nature of science fiction, it's worth recording.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.540
Paul writes that it has been said that those who do not learn history must repeat it.

04:39.360 --> 04:44.780
Ben Bova in another magazine published a little sooner, wrote that, to paraphrase Santayana,

04:45.280 --> 04:48.780
those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat the mistakes.

04:49.740 --> 04:50.940
I remember both endings.

04:51.660 --> 04:57.400
The both of my versions say that those who do not or was it refused to learn from history

04:57.400 --> 04:59.680
are condemned to, et cetera.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.280
There is considerable difference of content here.

05:04.620 --> 05:08.220
It makes little difference whether we must or are condemned or are doomed,

05:08.880 --> 05:12.520
but it matters much whether we need to learn history or to learn from it,

05:12.940 --> 05:18.300
and whether history has lessons we must learn or simply contents from which we must draw our own

05:18.300 --> 05:19.260
learnings.

05:19.980 --> 05:23.580
Another instructor in my department has been known to ask his student

05:24.140 --> 05:30.080
why truth is better told by myths than by factual instruction, and this has relevance here.

05:30.860 --> 05:35.900
It is noteworthy that the truths learned from history are never embodied in our histories,

05:36.240 --> 05:40.660
but in our mythologies, which often then are reabsorbed into the histories

05:41.420 --> 05:45.940
in forms designed not to purvey but to hide the truth.

05:47.080 --> 05:52.420
However, my colleague's point has relevance here, although I do not know that he would share the

05:52.420 --> 05:53.560
truths as I see it.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.560
Query, for instance, often does not.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.500
The relevance lies in the essence of the difference between fact and truth.

06:00.220 --> 06:06.640
A fact is an idea or an understanding which corresponds to reality in the outside world.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.720
Truth is that which corresponds to our own conceptions of the universe.

06:11.460 --> 06:15.920
This is the appeal science fiction has for many of us, and also by many people.

06:15.920 --> 06:16.840
Find it weird.

06:18.060 --> 06:23.560
Often they prefer out-and-out fantasy, such as in normal mainstream fiction,

06:24.040 --> 06:28.000
which corresponds with the truths that normal zombies of our culture are supposed to accept.

06:28.760 --> 06:33.520
Even they know it to be unreal and escapist, and science fiction is no less so,

06:33.720 --> 06:35.680
but at least we don't try to pretend it's real.

06:36.260 --> 06:39.800
Then we can use it to convey truths as well as to hide through facts.

06:40.360 --> 06:45.660
As Randall Garrett maintained at a past fan convention at San Francisco Airport,

06:46.360 --> 06:49.040
science fiction and mythologies have much in common.

06:50.740 --> 06:56.760
Back in February 1976, I did a review of one another of Paul's books,

06:57.220 --> 06:59.300
so I might as well throw it in at this point.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.360
Those of you, and I told the little men,

07:06.240 --> 07:11.180
who are in the science fiction book club, will already have read The Winter of the Worth.

07:11.820 --> 07:16.640
It's a good adventure story with a certain amount of intrigue more suggested than aptly described,

07:17.340 --> 07:21.420
and because Paul is one of the more thoughtful authors, a lot of thinking do's him.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.460
In this book, most of it's in italics, so if you want to you can skip that,

07:26.560 --> 07:28.780
but I warn you if you do, you'll miss a lot.

07:29.800 --> 07:34.720
Like many of Paul's longer stories, it's a little more complicated than the story requires.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.780
In some cases that improves the book, and in others it doesn't.

07:39.340 --> 07:42.820
In this case, it helps fill the space between the covers, which is all right,

07:42.980 --> 07:44.360
publishers have their needs too.

07:45.540 --> 07:48.380
It's about the Mississippi Valley and the rest of the world,

07:48.600 --> 07:52.860
about 5 or 10,000 years into a new ice age, hence the title.

07:53.720 --> 08:02.040
It involves an empire out of Texas in northern New Mexico, whose name is spelled R-A-H-I-A-C-D,

08:02.040 --> 08:05.980
and I don't know whether to pronounce it R-A-E-D or R-A-H-I-A-C-D.

08:06.600 --> 08:11.540
As I say, Paul is a thoughtful man, and being a very domesticated man,

08:12.120 --> 08:17.080
he's undoubtedly writing his yearnings, which he shares with most of us,

08:17.660 --> 08:21.220
when he explores the gulf between wild and domesticated animals.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.920
And remember, domesticated doesn't necessarily mean tame.

08:25.680 --> 08:30.360
There's a saying that in the Galapagos Islands, the wild animals are tame and the tame animals are wild.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.340
If you want me to, I'll explain that.

08:33.320 --> 08:37.580
Paul's explored the question before in a shorter Van Ryan story,

08:38.240 --> 08:43.420
saying that of two groups of aliens, one was domesticated and the other was wild animals.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.420
And Van Ryan pointed out that most of us are domesticated,

08:47.840 --> 08:50.360
but he and his group are wild animals.

08:51.440 --> 08:55.440
Similar considerations are given in this book in an evolutionary point of view,

08:56.080 --> 09:01.020
and he has one thing right. Evolutionary change always starts with a change of behavior,

09:01.320 --> 09:03.500
that is, of habits and ecology.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.860
But I don't like his terminology.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.260
For his aliens in the Van Ryan story, there wasn't enough information.

09:10.880 --> 09:15.280
But for people like Van Ryan, and like the Rogoviki in the Winter of the World,

09:15.540 --> 09:17.860
we have very precise other terms, which are better.

09:18.980 --> 09:22.000
Wild animals are stocks which have never been domesticated,

09:22.700 --> 09:27.440
animals which have had domesticated ancestors, but are not now under investigation

09:27.440 --> 09:31.140
on very characteristic features, unlike true wild animals.

09:31.980 --> 09:35.460
We say they have gone wild, and the technical term is feral.

09:36.300 --> 09:40.100
Both the Van Ryan pack and the Rogoviki are described as feral.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.740
They are also described as pack predators, as opposed to being herd animals.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.840
By and large, pack predators operate from a home base,

09:48.840 --> 09:53.520
but are not truly territorial in the sense of fixed boundaries to their land.

09:54.660 --> 09:59.380
For the Little Man's Meeting, on Friday, November 26, 1976,

10:01.000 --> 10:08.980
I gave a very short talk on the social science and science fiction.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.860
Of course, the first thing I did was to say it wasn't going to be limited to that.

10:16.100 --> 10:20.740
I told them that I had told Richard the Leader of the Meeting,

10:21.300 --> 10:24.920
that I would say something on that subject, but when I started working on it,

10:25.300 --> 10:28.680
I realized first that I'd be more comfortable calling it science

10:29.240 --> 10:34.200
and behavioral sciences and science fiction, because anthropology is both,

10:34.520 --> 10:36.060
and anthropology is how I think.

10:37.100 --> 10:41.720
Then second, I realized that there's just not time for an organized presentation here.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.720
So I said, I'll refer you to Pamela Sargent's Introduction to Women of Wonder,

10:47.000 --> 10:51.280
for a very good and very well organized presentation in one aspect of the field,

10:51.920 --> 10:55.200
which only has to be paraphrased to apply to several other aspects.

10:56.180 --> 10:59.520
I'll make some remarks about how the relationships are in general,

11:00.080 --> 11:05.940
not a review of specific stories, then I hope you all have questions to ask after I've said this.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.000
Actually, they didn't have very many questions to ask.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.680
I think they were too anxious to go and socialize at the club they go to after meetings.

11:16.740 --> 11:20.460
So I went on to say, by the standards of today,

11:21.000 --> 11:24.220
social and behavioral sciences are important in science fiction.

11:24.780 --> 11:29.720
Of course, they were always important, in that the way they were handled or not handled,

11:30.040 --> 11:32.760
made the difference between a good story and a not so good story.

11:33.580 --> 11:38.800
Such elements are usually referred to as background and character development,

11:38.800 --> 11:44.920
and plot handling are plot-led up, and various other aspects of storytelling itself.

11:45.740 --> 11:49.920
And they were what makes 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea a supreme masterpiece,

11:50.540 --> 11:54.740
and Mysterious Island, if it's sequel, just a moderately good adventure to it.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.100
John Camel is often given credit for introducing them into science fiction,

11:59.640 --> 12:03.780
but they were certainly present in Food of the Gods and Tarris Tarkas's revolution in

12:03.780 --> 12:07.480
Darkian morals to say nothing of Ralph one could foresee for one's gloss.

12:08.940 --> 12:13.640
The reason Camel gets such credit is mostly because so many writers remember that Camel

12:13.640 --> 12:18.920
was paying a cent a word, and sometimes two cents, for stories which had some of these features,

12:19.640 --> 12:24.240
while Fred Poehl and his fellow unfortunates on other pulps were paying from a fifth to

12:24.240 --> 12:30.640
half a cent for stories that didn't. What they don't stop to think about is that Camel knew about

12:31.360 --> 12:39.340
these things because Harry Bates paying two cents a word and F. Arlen Cremain paying one cent

12:39.340 --> 12:46.060
had previously demanded that of Camel. You may object that most of John Camel Jr.'s own stories

12:46.060 --> 12:50.700
didn't have much in the way of character development, but each of them did have something in the field

12:50.700 --> 12:55.680
of social or behavioral science, even if social and behavioral scientists might disagree with

12:55.680 --> 13:00.740
what he did. The readers didn't know any better, and as a matter of fact they mostly agreed with him.

13:01.280 --> 13:07.620
The difference now is that with people like Ursula Le Guin and McCaffrey writing, the standards for

13:07.620 --> 13:12.460
treatment of social and behavioral sciences in science fiction should now be at a higher level

13:12.460 --> 13:17.320
than the personal prejudices of John Camel and Ben Boeba, or for that member, Jerry Brunel.

13:18.620 --> 13:23.920
There are certain things we do know about people. We know that people tend to act in what they

13:23.920 --> 13:29.800
consider to be their own best interests, and we know that this includes being able afterwards to

13:29.800 --> 13:34.480
live with their consciences. We know that people tend to want to reciprocate what they get from

13:34.480 --> 13:40.100
others. This includes revenge as much as it includes paying other obligations. We know that on the

13:40.100 --> 13:46.300
other hand, that people tend to want to take things which are denied to them, but that they can be

13:46.300 --> 13:51.960
taught not to do this. We know that some people are capable of great cruelty to others and that

13:51.960 --> 13:57.240
other people raised in much the same cultures do not approve of this. There are many different

13:57.240 --> 14:02.540
kinds of behavior which anthropologists refer to as war, but some people do not have any such

14:02.540 --> 14:09.720
behaviors, and many people refuse to take part in. Many people write and talk about aggressive drives,

14:10.440 --> 14:15.420
but one thing we do know is that aggression is not a separate drive, but that the word is a cover

14:15.420 --> 14:20.740
term for various behaviors engaged in for various reasons, when, but not always when,

14:20.740 --> 14:27.860
any drive or desire is interfered with. We also know that such aggressive urge can be inhibited,

14:28.240 --> 14:33.700
and then may or may not turn against other targets, from the person himself to perfect strangers,

14:33.820 --> 14:39.040
seen only at a distance. People who live in excessively polite cultures tend to be excessively

14:39.040 --> 14:45.300
vicious in wars or in personal fumes. We know that the basic relationships between people are

14:45.300 --> 14:51.400
mediated relationships, and that power, and hence aggressiveness, is behavior related to control

14:51.400 --> 14:57.380
of access to resources. We know that dominance and submission are power relations, and hence also

14:57.380 --> 15:03.640
involves such control and lack of control, but that also dominance is itself a very prized resource,

15:04.020 --> 15:09.240
since a resource is anything anyone needs or wants or can be found into thinking he should try for.

15:10.320 --> 15:15.060
The various commodities, for instance, which are offered by those who conduct our practices of

15:15.060 --> 15:22.140
religion, are at times and for many people very valuable resources. Information is a most important

15:22.140 --> 15:27.760
resource, and those who control access to it can be very powerful. It should be noted that often,

15:28.220 --> 15:34.120
the actual practitioners in its supply do not control either the access or the supply. In our

15:34.120 --> 15:41.660
culture, this is what advertising and publishing aren't concerned with. Because social relationships

15:41.660 --> 15:47.560
are power relationships, and the resources required and available depend on the technology and not

15:47.560 --> 15:52.520
only the technological level, but the technological biases of the states of the arts,

15:53.120 --> 15:58.900
technology is very important to social organizations. However, rapid technological

15:58.900 --> 16:05.660
change may not bring social changes so rapidly. The various fascist movements, for instance,

16:06.080 --> 16:10.660
were efforts to reestablish feudal social relationships in a period of industrial capitalism,

16:10.660 --> 16:16.160
and as Milavan Jilis pointed out in the book that got him in jail the first time,

16:16.680 --> 16:21.000
the Communist and Socialist Revolution were efforts to establish industrial technology

16:21.000 --> 16:27.420
in countries whose prevailing social structures were still feudal and economic. For these reasons,

16:27.640 --> 16:33.160
plus those mentioned by James Gunn in this Fortress Rural, I'm very leery of stellar empires.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.920
Rolben Bucht had a rather plausible possibility in the weapons shop universe.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.800
Doc Smith's civilization is even more convincing. As to Glitch's fascist future,

16:44.360 --> 16:48.380
and I've already mentioned it, the substrate culture is now gone.

16:50.020 --> 16:55.480
To make a good story, you have to create tensions in the reader. Violence is a most

16:55.480 --> 17:01.300
inadequate way to do this, and besides, it creates in the reader or viewer the erroneous

17:01.300 --> 17:09.000
beliefs that violence is fun and that violence solves problems. Also, as Ben Boeva points out in

17:09.000 --> 17:14.300
notes to a science fiction writer, slam bang action is not what we mean by conflict.

17:15.520 --> 17:20.120
In science fiction, the main conflicts, that is to say, the tension-producing situations

17:20.760 --> 17:25.800
are simply culture shock and future shock, especially the explorations of extrapolations

17:25.800 --> 17:30.900
like age gold encouraged his writers to do for galaxy, and the various worlds created,

17:31.140 --> 17:36.740
for instance, by Ursula Gwynn. These are wholly social and behavioral problems within the

17:36.740 --> 17:43.640
spectator himself, being operated upon by what he sees in the story. One thing I like very much

17:43.640 --> 17:48.000
about John Campbell's approach to stories was his violation of one rule of American storytelling.

17:49.080 --> 17:54.780
Our culture places great emphasis on failure. The object of competition and testing is not to

17:54.780 --> 18:00.980
produce winners, is to produce losers, and thus a general rule of our fiction is that a protagonist

18:00.980 --> 18:06.600
has to go through a cycle of degradation. He's not allowed to win until he's had a few failures.

18:07.360 --> 18:12.140
John Campbell wasn't interested in this. He was interested in winners. His writers couldn't always

18:12.140 --> 18:17.320
go along with him, so he printed a lot of degradation cycle stories, but he didn't insist on it as

18:17.320 --> 18:24.380
most editors do. Anthropology is the social and behavioral science that deals with groups of

18:24.380 --> 18:32.000
people, but that still deals with them not only as people, but as whole human beings. That is why

18:32.000 --> 18:36.620
the very best science fiction has a lot of ethnography in it, because ethnography is the branch of

18:36.620 --> 18:42.380
anthropology which deals with societies and cultures as the beliefs and activities of individual

18:42.380 --> 18:48.620
human beings living together as organized groups. Doc Smith was a master at this, and he did it so

18:48.620 --> 18:54.300
well that most people don't realize he was doing it. Naturally there's lots more I could say,

18:55.160 --> 18:58.460
but some of you may have questions, and the rest of you probably want to get out of here.

18:59.300 --> 19:10.220
They did. Also at that time I prepared a comment on the election debates for my anthropology classes.

19:12.060 --> 19:17.960
In the first debate I told them, Mr. Ford charged the Jimmy Carter successor, the present governor

19:17.960 --> 19:23.960
of Georgia, had told Ford that the Medicare setup in Georgia was a shambles, and that therefore Carter

19:23.960 --> 19:29.320
wasn't much of an administrator. The porklets didn't even realize that Medicare is a federal

19:29.320 --> 19:34.420
program, and it's a scandal all over the United States, and that the governor was not complaining

19:34.420 --> 19:41.060
about Carter as an administrator, but about Ford. The governor, that is the current governor of

19:41.060 --> 19:46.320
Georgia, did try to set the record straight the next day, but he got very brief mention in the media

19:46.320 --> 19:51.040
and hasn't been picked up by the Carter campaign either. Carter on the other hand

19:51.600 --> 19:57.760
noted the need for a national health program, and that there were poor people he knows in

19:57.760 --> 20:04.140
planes who had very great difficulty getting any medical care. But Carter did not. It would never

20:04.140 --> 20:09.300
occur to him to realize there might be an intimate relationship between the poverty of those friends

20:09.300 --> 20:14.100
of his, and the fact that the Carter family owns five and a half billion dollars worth of property

20:14.100 --> 20:19.580
and business, none of which could exist without the presence of a reservoir of low paid, mostly

20:19.580 --> 20:27.220
seasonal rural labor. The whole little agribusiness setup he has is completely dependent on. If they

20:27.220 --> 20:32.760
were his slaves, he would recognize his need and responsibility, and would have health care for them

20:32.760 --> 20:37.660
just as he has mechanics for his machinery and calls them veterinarians for his livestock. But

20:37.660 --> 20:43.060
for over a century, no one has admitted that there is slavery in America, so his responsibility is

20:43.060 --> 20:47.800
reduced to a tug of his heart strings and an effort to shift the burden from the county hospital

20:47.800 --> 20:53.700
and the local property tax to the federal government so we can have a Medicare shambles for everyone

20:53.700 --> 21:00.420
and not just for folks over 65 who have social security. Now that of course doesn't for

21:01.140 --> 21:08.380
glance look like science fiction, but at least it's a footnote in preparation for reading some

21:08.380 --> 21:17.460
say of James Gunn's medical future. In her excellent introduction to women of wonder,

21:18.400 --> 21:27.600
Hamillus Argy writes on pages Small Roman Moon Rose 32 to 34,

21:28.400 --> 21:39.060
a footnote mostly concerning quotations from Stanislaw Lem and Ursula Le Guin,

21:40.800 --> 21:48.940
largely also concerning the status of men, women, and the people of winter.

21:52.860 --> 21:58.360
I wrote to Hamillus Argy and Ursula Le Guin about this.

22:00.540 --> 22:07.820
I'll quote from the letter to Ursula Le Guin. While reading his remarks and before I got to yours,

22:08.520 --> 22:15.360
I was thinking how he fit my stereotypes for his sex cultural psychology as a Central European man.

22:16.030 --> 22:21.880
Then when he threw in the observation that quote cultural psychological conditioning,

22:22.040 --> 22:28.220
unquote, was more powerful in biological minds with the insistence of implicit conditioning

22:28.220 --> 22:33.960
must necessarily be the same in chloride as in polum, despite his later statement to the contrary.

22:36.380 --> 22:42.700
My stereotype, while I was thinking that you as a woman, even here in the free world,

22:42.700 --> 22:47.640
had been writing of the Cthinian cycle as liberating from the tyranny of sex roles,

22:48.200 --> 22:54.280
while Lem, as a Central European male, was responding that it made for intolerable uncertainty.

22:55.220 --> 23:00.720
Obviously, at least for Lem, Polish dialectics has not yet achieved the Marxian ideal of

23:00.720 --> 23:06.240
abolishing the contradiction between male and female roles, and not even the general uncertainties

23:06.240 --> 23:11.520
which are part of life in patron-plaint societies. Or had you heard of George Foster's development

23:11.520 --> 23:16.660
of Konigman's image of the limited good, which actually is a special case of the principle

23:16.660 --> 23:23.320
of fixed available amounts? About what one wears in 20 Below Winds.

23:24.660 --> 23:29.780
Stephenson said, how come he got so much credit for the few winters he spent in the Arctic,

23:30.440 --> 23:35.580
and none for the 20 odd he spent in North Dakota? And he never saw any weather in the Arctic to

23:35.580 --> 23:43.320
max that in Dakota. Well, how did one handle skirts in Dakota? Indian women wore raw hide skirts,

23:43.780 --> 23:53.020
very heavy. White culture had cloth skirts, and they wore pants under them, winter woollies and

23:53.020 --> 23:59.240
cotton or linen blumers. But it was the skirts and underskirts that showed the latter mainly by bulk.

24:00.540 --> 24:04.940
I often wanted to write to you to tell you my opinion, which I have expressed to many others,

24:04.940 --> 24:09.880
that you know much more about people than your father did. And quite likely, more about peoples.

24:10.800 --> 24:15.300
I do not know how he was at home, but around the department, he was the living embodiment

24:15.300 --> 24:21.020
of his thesis that culture operates people rather than the other way around. He was very much the

24:21.020 --> 24:26.460
professor and very much the head of department, but still at times the vivid vital individual

24:26.460 --> 24:31.140
would show through when we could see what status and role were being separately from the man.

24:32.900 --> 24:38.140
Odd that he and Murdoch and White, the three who most talked that the individual was hopeless in

24:38.140 --> 24:42.960
the hands of culture, that they probably more than any others of their generation influenced

24:42.960 --> 24:48.740
in the role of the culture of American anthropology. But I wonder, I have one more comment on your

24:48.740 --> 24:56.780
comments. You asked about a neuter or a non-committal program. If anyone believes that English lacks

24:56.780 --> 25:04.360
such a pronoun, then they have forgotten how much effort their parents and teachers expended to stop

25:04.360 --> 25:11.420
them from saying they in the singular. And speaking of winter, I hope I will be seeing you at Vancouver

25:11.420 --> 25:24.460
next summer. Well, she wrote back saying that Lem was very charming in his letters, but that what

25:24.460 --> 25:28.740
most people didn't realize about Lem is that he plays the European scholarly game.

25:32.240 --> 25:38.280
I thank her for confirming my judgment of Lem. He's right in the stream of Central European Society

25:39.560 --> 25:47.740
because the bad mannered arrogant, that is patronizing European scholarly game is not a game

25:47.740 --> 25:53.420
at all. It's deadly serious. And I do mean life and death. It's a client making and patron

25:53.420 --> 25:59.920
refusing behavior. The private charmingness is at home there too. It's appropriate for client keeping

25:59.920 --> 26:06.060
and for addressing as an equal, who one doesn't wish to have respond in the client making patron

26:06.060 --> 26:11.680
refusing style. And it's also appropriate to use to someone who really is a patron great over you.

26:12.320 --> 26:19.320
I reported this at a little men's meeting. And I added to them, you remember what I said about

26:19.320 --> 26:24.460
excessively polite cultures being very vicious in war or few. Well, this is a sample.

26:26.140 --> 26:34.700
Later in that meeting, the regular speaker for the meeting was a man who had engaged in

26:34.700 --> 26:41.480
contract physics in Europe and in America. And he commented on the cutthroat nature

26:42.100 --> 26:52.400
of the people in academia and also in industrial jobs in nuclear physics and other kinds of physics.

26:54.000 --> 27:00.560
And the expressions and descriptions that he used in speaking of this

27:01.740 --> 27:07.040
were very much in line with what I just said about the scholarly game. In fact, I caught his eye

27:07.040 --> 27:17.440
and he grinned back at me. I also just ran across a note which is dated the first of March 1970

27:17.440 --> 27:26.380
in which I discussed with Paul at a little men's meeting soon after. In the prefatory note to the

27:26.380 --> 27:32.960
story of the three-cornered wheel and his book, The Trouble Twisters, he quoted a advanced haul

27:32.960 --> 27:40.040
that, and the quotation is, man the child of earth lives by certain principles which are immutable.

27:40.480 --> 27:47.240
And quote, these are there given as Parkinson's first and second laws, Sturgeon's revelation,

27:48.060 --> 27:58.960
Murphy's law, and a fourth law of cerebral dynamics. This latter, in my estimation, is merely a way

27:58.960 --> 28:06.140
of stating the law of entropy. And it seems also that Parkinson's first law only applies to humans

28:06.140 --> 28:12.000
within the orbit of civilization. That law, where folks touched by civilization, which is to say

28:12.000 --> 28:19.460
affected by exploitation, and the others, in some degree for all folk, are human ways of making

28:19.460 --> 28:25.720
entropy. But they're far from being immutable. They're highly variable, both in degree and in

28:25.720 --> 28:35.960
manifestation, though they do touch most of the laws for all people, and Parkinson's first law

28:35.960 --> 28:45.420
only for those in civilization. Two years ago at Oakland, and I understand that some other

28:46.320 --> 28:55.100
cons around that time, a little panel of writers talking about the military mind and how

28:55.100 --> 29:07.620
misunderstood it was by many people. It occurred to me that it was possible there might be such a

29:07.620 --> 29:18.280
panel at Vancouver. So I wrote to them and said that it was almost impossible to answer these

29:18.280 --> 29:23.740
people from the floor. But if there was such a panel, I would like to be on it so I could

29:24.460 --> 29:31.520
give some words of true wisdom from the table instead of fighting for a spot from the floor.

29:33.320 --> 29:38.600
Well, I haven't heard from them, so I don't think that I will be on any such panel.

29:39.860 --> 29:49.900
But I did prepare some remarks. After all, I didn't know how much time I would have, so I

29:50.620 --> 29:59.000
boiled my absolutely minimal essential presentation of about four hours that I boiled down to about

29:59.000 --> 30:07.900
five minutes and ten seconds. I was going to start with a reference to the West Coast maneuvers of

30:07.900 --> 30:15.960
July 1941, before the United States was officially in World War II. There were two arms, one of

30:15.960 --> 30:22.380
regular Army units and one of former National Guard officers. The rules made so the regulars

30:22.380 --> 30:27.740
couldn't possibly lose. They were losing, so the rules were changed to favor them still more.

30:28.320 --> 30:33.000
And again, finally the whole thing was called off a week early just before the final devolved.

30:34.220 --> 30:39.620
You see, all during peacetime, the War College keeps the regular Army officers trained about

30:39.620 --> 30:45.140
what to do when war comes. The National Guard officers get some of this, but they don't take

30:45.140 --> 30:49.880
it all that seriously, because they have to spend most of their time living in the real world,

30:50.440 --> 30:55.460
something the regular officers don't know much about. There was one guy in my regiment who did

30:55.460 --> 31:01.420
take it seriously, the security officer. The others didn't take him seriously, but they should have.

31:01.900 --> 31:11.520
He was what it was all about. Well, we're right. We do make cracks about the military

31:12.260 --> 31:17.020
and we don't see that much difference between military occupation troops and so-called peace

31:18.200 --> 31:23.420
and the conquest troops in war. All the bodies are prettier, they shave and bathe.

31:25.740 --> 31:31.940
In almost all societies, the organization of fighters for war parallels that of men's work

31:31.940 --> 31:38.360
groups. In fact, they often have the same personnel, but in our society, and I include here the Soviets,

31:39.160 --> 31:43.580
the organization of the military is like the social organization which preceded ours.

31:44.320 --> 31:50.560
The kind of society we refer to as feudal or semi-feudal. The peasant-based societies organized

31:50.560 --> 31:56.020
into patron-client sets, where patrons are to make the decisions and clients are first to be exploited

31:56.020 --> 32:00.800
and second to be ordered. And to put up with that, they have to be specially indoctrinated.

32:01.740 --> 32:04.840
As Aubrey Bermont reminded us from the audience at Oakland,

32:05.780 --> 32:11.600
400 years and more ago, the people did not think the way we do. Our type of civilian mind was then

32:11.600 --> 32:16.340
just beginning to rise to contest the hitherto unchallenged rule of the military line.

32:18.800 --> 32:24.700
And then I was going to ask, if anyone in the audience knows the purpose of close-order drill.

32:25.640 --> 32:30.400
The Russians once tried to abolish close-order drill and they found that they had no army.

32:31.380 --> 32:36.340
Ilron Hubbard, who wrote Fear and Pipewriter in the Sky and that masterpiece Final Blackout

32:36.340 --> 32:43.220
and Ordoch Matusula Stories, was in the military. He was a Navy commander, and one of his basic

32:43.220 --> 32:48.660
teachings is that all authority rests upon the ability to move people about physically in space.

32:50.100 --> 32:55.780
So, I was going to say, I'll put this in terms that at least the Scientologists here will be able

32:55.780 --> 33:03.280
to understand. Close-order drill is an opening procedure drill to reduce calm lag between the

33:03.280 --> 33:09.700
time an order is received and the time it's carried out. So, all this go there, do that, stop it,

33:10.100 --> 33:15.460
do something else, go somewhere else. You see the close-order drill and you see the opening

33:15.460 --> 33:20.900
procedure drill. It is simply to condition you to take orders without stopping to think about it.

33:21.540 --> 33:26.240
The difference is that Scientology later teaches you how to make up your own orders and give them

33:26.240 --> 33:33.200
to yourself, and the military never willingly lets you go. You wind up being a wind up toy,

33:33.760 --> 33:40.760
programmed to their ideas, and you start wondering why these crazy civilians won't just bend over and

33:41.420 --> 33:47.460
do what you think they should. And that is why we make such remarks about the military mind.

33:48.240 --> 33:53.700
Now, I could go on with this, but I'll sum it up. The purpose of the military is not to die for

33:53.700 --> 33:59.540
one's country. It's not even to make the enemy die for his country. It is to make the enemy live

33:59.540 --> 34:05.540
for one's own country. That means to destroy the enemy as an independent organization. In other

34:05.540 --> 34:10.820
words, the purpose of the military is conquest, which is to say the increase of one's own plant

34:10.820 --> 34:16.360
set and its perpetuation. And if you want a course in the Anthropology of Peasant Base,

34:16.360 --> 34:19.800
military administered, patron plant societies, I'll be around.

34:23.520 --> 34:30.660
So, it occurs to me that some of the people on that panel

34:32.000 --> 34:39.600
od me. I wasn't used to the helpless, inadequate feeling I got when I heard them on this subject.

34:40.520 --> 34:44.620
The nearest I can recall is the way I used to feel around a certain corporal,

34:44.620 --> 34:50.620
soon after I was first drafted into the U.S. Army. And since it's an example that shows

34:51.400 --> 34:57.980
the nature of some aspects of this particular military mind, let me tell you.

34:59.920 --> 35:05.300
He was a little big for his age, so he lied about his years and joined the National Guard when he

35:05.300 --> 35:10.960
was in high school. And they double crossed him and started getting ready for war. His altitude

35:10.960 --> 35:17.880
had been activated in October 1940, so by the time I was drafted in February 1941,

35:18.680 --> 35:23.380
he already had four months of a nasty, muddy, Puget Sound winter under his belt.

35:24.580 --> 35:28.920
They'd gotten some training between raindrops, and now they were training a training cadre,

35:29.140 --> 35:33.360
and he was a corporal, and they were supposed to pass what they'd found on gas.

35:34.920 --> 35:39.240
Well, nothing's perfect, so now and then I'd have to ask the question,

35:39.240 --> 35:44.340
and even very seldom make a suggestion. Like, if we're going to be digging all these holes,

35:45.160 --> 35:49.940
wouldn't it make sense, first, to set aside the turf from where the hole in the pile of dirt

35:49.940 --> 35:54.420
are going to be, and then afterward lay it over the dirt so it won't be quite so obvious just

35:54.420 --> 36:00.680
where the holes are? You know, I wasn't trying to show up to trainers. It's just that I wanted

36:00.680 --> 36:06.360
my fellow draftees to have at least a minimal chance of survival if they came to that. Besides,

36:06.360 --> 36:11.660
I'm selfish, and the more survivor types I have around me, the better chance I have of surviving

36:11.660 --> 36:16.940
a moment. Well, this corporal was one of the snotiest of snot-willed kids. You understand,

36:17.200 --> 36:21.660
he wasn't dumb. He really had great potential. It's just that he thought he was already there.

36:22.660 --> 36:28.300
He was on the same floor, the same barracks, as the squad I was in. God, he wasn't my corporal.

36:28.460 --> 36:34.200
I had a real good corporal. I really loved that. But the kid embarked on a real deliberate campaign

36:34.200 --> 36:42.000
to humiliate me. Well, I was living it. The only one day I was over in the rec room writing a letter.

36:43.020 --> 36:47.080
Naturally, I got a table as far back as possible and along one wall so I could see everything,

36:47.420 --> 36:52.300
especially who came in and went out the door. Then a bunch of kids came in, including the corporal.

36:52.680 --> 36:56.780
They had an older sergeant with me. He was from another outfit, and I'd never seen him before,

36:56.840 --> 37:01.660
but I noticed they held him in very high regard, and he had a forest green braid on his sleeve,

37:01.660 --> 37:05.940
which meant that in a previous military incarnation, he'd been an officer.

37:06.980 --> 37:12.440
They took seats in the corner behind me, and I wasn't paying any attention after all of my business.

37:13.100 --> 37:17.780
But suddenly the corporal's voice rose above the level of the conversation, and he said,

37:18.620 --> 37:28.900
the worst kind of bullet is ricochet. Well, I know that possessed me to butt in,

37:29.400 --> 37:34.480
but I turned around and said, the worst kind of bullet is a spent bullet. It dripped so long,

37:35.100 --> 37:40.940
hunting. The sergeant got very excited. He said, who'd been in action? Where were you?

37:41.860 --> 37:48.580
And I said, huh? You weren't in action. Where was it? And just about the time I began to get back

37:48.580 --> 37:52.780
control of my lower jaw, the corporal began to realize what was happening. You lost control of his.

37:55.860 --> 37:59.620
Well, I wish I could say that after that he was a changed character, but he wasn't.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.900
It's just that he was no longer carrying on a deliberate campaign.

38:03.860 --> 38:08.700
But you see what I mean about a hopeless, helpless, inadequate feeling. How do you educate brilliant,

38:08.880 --> 38:15.180
but ignorant people who already know everything? Now, I want you to understand, though, that the

38:15.180 --> 38:20.600
corporal's attitude was completely characteristic of the military mind, and it's documented by

38:20.600 --> 38:26.200
numerous studies of patron clients' societies. It's especially found in situations where the

38:26.200 --> 38:31.620
respective ranks do not very much differ. People who are clearly a patron grade have much more

38:31.620 --> 38:37.280
effective ways to keep clients aware of the fact. People with just a little authority have to keep

38:37.280 --> 38:42.980
fighting for it, and the methods they use are born of desperation. The fact that I didn't want his

38:42.980 --> 38:49.420
job was immaterial. I was obviously going to be one of the first new PFCs, and he was the youngest

38:49.420 --> 39:00.600
old corporal. To the militarized mind, he was in dire danger. I was also hoping that someone would

39:00.600 --> 39:07.960
pick up on that remark I made about the security officer being what it was all about, and would

39:07.960 --> 39:14.480
ask me from the audience what I meant. I had an answer to that, too. The answer is this.

39:15.040 --> 39:20.500
You've heard it said that our army is always ready for the last previous war it was in.

39:21.320 --> 39:25.540
In 1941, we were going to fight against Hitler's conquest of the German people,

39:26.040 --> 39:31.560
and in France and the Low Countries and Norway, also against the Japanese conquest and those of

39:31.560 --> 39:39.140
Mussolini. The last war our military was in at that time had not been against Germany in World War

39:39.140 --> 39:43.700
but the interventions through Archangel and Vladivostok and in the Baltic States,

39:44.400 --> 39:48.780
and they've never forgiven the rest of us for the war we actually had been fighting in the 19th

39:48.780 --> 39:57.080
parties. I understand that the oral history association itself threw out of the meeting

39:57.080 --> 40:04.740
a void big old red pearl in which Red Bull said he'd heard from me. The letter I wrote in was a

40:04.740 --> 40:11.120
result of this statement on page two of the early poll that in March of 1933 fandom didn't exist.

40:11.980 --> 40:18.600
I wrote variants of it to the three main promas. It never surfaced in Amazing, even though it

40:18.600 --> 40:24.220
contained a leader commenting on the 50th anniversary issue and how Amazing, under Grinsbeck, had

40:24.220 --> 40:30.920
actually spawned the very first fan org. Then Boba returned to postcard saying that's fandom,

40:30.920 --> 40:38.280
and here at Analog we don't get into fandom. Galaxy, which does get into fandom, also sank the

40:38.280 --> 40:43.800
letter to that trace. Then I wrote Algro and direct reply to that having reprinted the statement by

40:43.800 --> 40:50.860
Paul and I've been told they printed the letter but I haven't seen that issue. Grinsbeck ran quite

40:50.860 --> 40:55.420
a letter column and printed the addresses in full so from almost the first there was some

40:55.420 --> 41:01.360
correspondence between the readers. Finally Ray Palmer organized it. He seems to have written to

41:01.360 --> 41:06.820
everyone whose address had appeared. The result was the Science Correspondence Club. The magazine

41:06.820 --> 41:15.040
began in 1926. The club may have started as early as 1928 or as late as 1929. I'm sure it was not as

41:15.040 --> 41:22.300
early as 1927. The name was later changed to International Scientific Association. Then one

41:22.300 --> 41:27.940
summer day I answered a ring at our door and a tall dark young man asked if my brother was on

41:27.940 --> 41:33.260
him. Well I had three brothers but I assumed he meant the older one. Turns out that's what he assumed

41:33.260 --> 41:41.140
too. You mean Alan I asked? No he said Clifton. It was Auburn and Brenna. The next one he contacted

41:41.140 --> 41:45.940
was Lester Anderson and Haber. We formed the East Bay Scientific Association and the name

41:45.940 --> 41:52.580
would never change even after we had members in San Francisco. I know it lasted until at least 1935

41:52.580 --> 41:58.400
and maybe later. Auburn says it must have been started in 1928 because he has something about

41:58.400 --> 42:05.540
it in my handwriting dated 1928 and it now. I know it had to be after the current organization became

42:05.540 --> 42:12.180
International Scientific Association because we copied that name. I'm also very sure it had to be

42:12.180 --> 42:17.420
1930 because I recall it was just after I'd come home after shipping on a tanker district in

42:17.420 --> 42:22.220
Columbia and an old in the University of California summer session and that was 1930.

42:23.980 --> 42:29.280
After the international organization responded, Gernsback had one of his cover picture stories

42:29.280 --> 42:35.760
contest. I think it was the first one maybe the only one from Amazing. I toyed with trying to

42:35.760 --> 42:41.540
write a story to Andrew but Roy Palmer wrote one and won. I believe the prize money was a hundred

42:41.540 --> 42:47.140
dollars. He used it to buy the organization a mimeograph and put out a club or a big cosmology.

42:47.820 --> 42:51.280
You could get quite a mimeograph for a hundred dollars in those days.

42:53.800 --> 43:00.940
Anyway from then on the president was also editor. By 1932 Auburn was president and editor

43:00.940 --> 43:06.840
and I was secretary and assistant editor. In passing through two or three hands something had happened

43:06.840 --> 43:12.560
to the mimeograph. What we received from past president Eaton in Atlanta was not a machine.

43:13.140 --> 43:18.500
Eaton swore it was just what he had received from his predecessor. The mimeograph drum was

43:18.500 --> 43:23.540
flattened out to about a quarter circle. A flat deck was laid over it and a handle put in the middle

43:23.540 --> 43:29.100
of the deck. This you held and leaned on while rolling the drum and stencil length of the sheet

43:29.100 --> 43:34.140
of paper. I've seen them since for postcard size but that's the only one I ever saw for eight and a

43:34.140 --> 43:43.220
half by eleven paper. I saw quite too much of it. Auburn saw more. I left in August 1932 to go to

43:43.220 --> 43:48.840
be graduate assistant in anthropology at the University of Nebraska. I stopped to see some

43:48.840 --> 43:53.700
members in Oregon and Washington and hitchhiked to Milwaukee where I made the same mistake with

43:54.400 --> 44:00.940
Ray that Auburn made with me. The first thought I had when he opened the door was my guy,

44:00.940 --> 44:07.080
he didn't tell me his younger brother was hunchbacked too. All the time I was there Ray was

44:07.080 --> 44:12.360
warning me about the people I'd be staying with in Chicago. Walter Dennis was founder and president

44:12.360 --> 44:18.180
of the Chicago Club. Ray had visited and told me Dennis's mother was German and said great store

44:18.180 --> 44:24.080
of good food and would keep insisting I have more at meals and forcing it on me. Actually I didn't

44:24.080 --> 44:30.660
see anything unusual and nobody forced anything on me. The Chicago Club was actually not very

44:30.660 --> 44:36.240
active finish. They had founded an astronomy club based on the then bright new Adler Panitarium

44:36.240 --> 44:43.000
and the astronomy club would sort of squabble the pan blow. Ray had also mentioned our one member in

44:43.000 --> 44:48.560
Lincoln where I was going. It was one of our few girl or young women members and it seemed some

44:48.560 --> 44:54.680
of Ray's letters had been rather glowing. Incidentally just as I always signed my name CHA,

44:54.680 --> 45:03.400
small letter H and small letter A, Ray always used RAP, small A and small P. I think we both

45:03.400 --> 45:10.400
started that before either of us wrote to the other. I asked my lift into Lincoln how to get to

45:10.400 --> 45:16.120
the fans address. Why? That sounds like it's down in Russian town he said making a plane

45:16.120 --> 45:22.040
known to want to go or go anyone down there. It seemed everyone down there spoke German.

45:23.160 --> 45:30.600
As a matter of fact, there were in that part of town many people from Russia being well good

45:30.600 --> 45:37.480
Germans like many of the lovers on the northern California Mendocino coast who were Lucian Finns.

45:38.300 --> 45:43.160
Well I found the place but it wasn't well. It seemed she was recently married and her husband

45:43.160 --> 45:48.340
had seen at least one of Ray's letters. Ray had known it as she had written to ask him not to send

45:48.340 --> 45:54.020
any more. I can't recall whether I shamed off my beard at Milwaukee or after I got to Lincoln.

45:55.500 --> 46:00.700
Dr. Miles J. Brewer also lived at Lincoln. His office was in the building a block and a half

46:00.700 --> 46:05.580
from where I got a room. I never did see. His receptionist evidently didn't approve of science

46:05.580 --> 46:12.420
fiction and let me know I was on World War One. Christmas vacation I went to Boston to visit

46:12.420 --> 46:18.000
the other local fan club. We believed that it was older than the Chicago one but probably not as old

46:18.000 --> 46:23.340
as East Bay. At some time briefly there seems to have been one in New York City but just when I

46:23.340 --> 46:28.760
don't know. Maybe Connie Ruppert might know. He put out science fiction digest and I spent a couple

46:28.760 --> 46:34.060
of days with him. He lived in South Ozone Park then in one of those hyphenated Queens addresses.

46:35.600 --> 46:40.780
While others around Boston I visited as I recall one of the Oregon members named Ockerman

46:40.780 --> 46:48.700
possibly with two Ns who was going to MIT. He was in nuclear chemistry. There were very few of them.

46:49.120 --> 46:54.980
Now I guess they're all absorbed in the nuclear physics. That winter or the next one I believe

46:54.980 --> 47:00.780
Washington University near St. Louis, Aaron Hubbard and John Camel Jr. were taking the very first

47:00.780 --> 47:08.400
class ever given called nuclear physics. During his dianetics period Camel announced that he had

47:08.400 --> 47:14.300
discovered that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny was a very important pangoramic phrase behind his

47:14.300 --> 47:19.820
mind and he couldn't understand why it should be so strong in the mind of a physical scientist.

47:20.260 --> 47:25.840
Then he remembered that he grew up in the household of a biologist. But he seems never to have made

47:25.840 --> 47:29.820
the connection between the above facts and his lifelong dedication to the proposition

47:29.820 --> 47:36.520
many cultural phenomena are of genetic origin. Incidentally the weather that winter was very

47:36.520 --> 47:41.740
cold and deep snows hit just before I started. I couldn't hitchhike. I went by freight to Elizabeth

47:41.740 --> 47:46.540
New Jersey and by a bus from New York City to Boston and back then freight back to Lincoln.

47:47.420 --> 47:52.980
After that storm Ray wrote the East wind blew off the frozen lake and made it even colder in

47:52.980 --> 47:58.020
Milwaukee. He took pictures of hot water to the second floor window, poured them out in front

47:58.020 --> 48:02.960
of people coming along. The outside of the water would freeze on the way down, shatter against the

48:02.960 --> 48:08.540
rock and a cloud of steam would rise up in front of him. On the other hand how much of that Ray

48:08.540 --> 48:13.480
wrote me is true as questionable. Other people say he wrote them different accounts of his life at that time.

48:15.660 --> 48:24.520
To change the subject completely, Spider Robinson's recent column on books by women

48:25.800 --> 48:30.820
inspired me to write him quite a letter. One of the points I made to him was that I couldn't

48:30.820 --> 48:38.340
understand why it took him so long to accumulate all those books because most of them were old books.

48:39.780 --> 48:45.140
Even at the time, even considering how long it takes to get something published in Amazing.

48:46.400 --> 48:53.940
However, since I wrote him the letter I've been thinking more about women writers of science fiction

48:54.550 --> 49:00.920
and it's true. There have always been women writers of science fiction. There have always been very

49:00.920 --> 49:08.620
good women writers of science fiction. The point is there have not been the cloud of mediocre

49:09.290 --> 49:16.120
women science fiction writers as there has been a cloud of mediocre men science fiction writers.

49:17.260 --> 49:25.540
Regardless of whether they use their own names or their initials or a fake name,

49:27.880 --> 49:33.680
still for a woman to break into science fiction writing she had to be real good.

49:35.400 --> 49:42.900
And then of course there's the recent June 1977 women's issue of analog.

49:44.660 --> 49:53.940
He said, Ben Bovitt said that he could not get women artists. It's very strange.

49:54.380 --> 49:59.780
At the same time this thing was on the stands, there was an issue of galaxy on the stands

50:00.600 --> 50:08.900
with a cover and interior work by Bonnie Delzell. And oddly enough her work for that galaxy

50:09.900 --> 50:18.840
was very very similar to the cover art and inside work that appeared by a man on the women's issue

50:18.840 --> 50:30.400
of analog. Totally unlike other and to my eyes better work by Bonnie Delzell. And by the way

50:30.400 --> 50:38.140
did you see the AP wire photo of the Prudhoe Bay control room for the Alaska pipeline?

50:39.040 --> 50:45.720
I swear those two hard hats sitting there are aliens or maybe one of them's only half alien.

50:46.400 --> 50:54.780
The names are Margus, M-A-R-G-I-S, Frechtl, F-R-E-I-C-H-T-L, and the other one is named

50:54.780 --> 51:05.940
Blav, FunTempt, F-U-N-T-E-M-P-T. Surely those are not birth names. Maybe they were devised by Jack Vance.
