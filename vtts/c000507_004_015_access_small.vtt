00:08.560 --> 00:12.520
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.320 --> 00:33.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.720
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.280
Of all the themes handled by science fiction authors, that of alien contact has been one

00:49.280 --> 00:51.380
of the most consistently popular and fascinating.

00:51.380 --> 00:56.260
For a good reason too. Aliens, whether they be the hostile bug-eyed monsters of the old

00:56.260 --> 00:59.600
pulp magazines or the friendly creatures of close encounters of the third kind,

01:00.180 --> 01:02.520
have always been one of the biggest attractions of science fiction.

01:03.100 --> 01:06.620
In the past, stories of alien contact were usually written as thrillers,

01:06.960 --> 01:09.620
with the sole and simple intention of scaring readers.

01:10.260 --> 01:14.960
HD Wells, The War of the Worlds is probably the best example of that type of story.

01:15.220 --> 01:20.200
But that's changed. Many contemporary writers have provided more thoughtful treatments of aliens,

01:20.200 --> 01:24.120
deepening the realism and the significance of narratives of alien contact.

01:31.820 --> 01:36.720
Of course, before you can have a story of alien contact, you have to have some aliens.

01:37.320 --> 01:41.260
One of the most provocative descriptions of aliens in all of science fiction is found in

01:41.260 --> 01:44.600
Larry Nivens and Jerry Pornell's The Moat in God's Eye.

01:45.020 --> 01:48.620
The success of that book is largely due to the unique and ingenious aliens,

01:48.620 --> 01:51.340
the modis that Niven created for the story.

01:51.700 --> 01:55.780
It's interesting though that Niven says he doesn't really create aliens for a story,

01:56.180 --> 01:58.040
but suggests that it's the other way around.

01:58.960 --> 02:07.000
I always design aliens for themselves. I almost never design an alien to match a story.

02:07.640 --> 02:14.300
The story, some story will eventually include the alien. The alien stands for itself.

02:15.040 --> 02:19.240
There are two particularly fascinating things that Niven incorporated into these modis.

02:19.740 --> 02:25.080
One is the fact that they are not symmetrical. They have a head, torso, legs and arms as humans do,

02:25.480 --> 02:29.580
but the arms are disproportionate. One is small and thin, the other is large and powerful.

02:29.940 --> 02:34.560
Right. Niven says he took that idea from studying the structures of living creatures on Earth.

02:35.240 --> 02:43.100
In that case, I had the idea that I was following a progression with a protozoan,

02:43.100 --> 02:47.540
with an amoeba. You get radio symmetry inside and out.

02:48.900 --> 02:55.600
Move up a goodly distance and you find starfishes with radio symmetry on the outside and bilateral

02:55.600 --> 03:01.400
symmetry on the inside. Move up a little further, you find flat worms and worms of all

03:01.400 --> 03:09.680
stance. At the level of bilateral symmetry inside and out, go as far as a human, you find

03:09.680 --> 03:17.840
bilateral symmetry on the outside and no symmetry, well, half symmetrical on the inside.

03:18.260 --> 03:24.100
The lungs look symmetrical, the kidneys look symmetrical, the intestines look like somebody

03:24.100 --> 03:32.860
dropped a plate of spaghetti. I tried to move on to the next step, bilaterally unsymmetrical

03:32.860 --> 03:38.820
on the outside and I got the original Modi, the engineer for them.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.440
The other ingenious idea Niven developed for the Modi's is the way they construct and use machines.

03:55.220 --> 03:59.700
They're highly skilled tool users, but they have no standard pre-manufactured machines,

03:59.700 --> 04:04.540
parts or tools. They simply alter or reshape whatever they find around them at the time to

04:04.540 --> 04:10.060
suit their needs. Niven says that particular idea just came to him. It seemed interesting and even

04:10.060 --> 04:16.600
logical. I was just playing with the ideas at that point and that one seemed like a fun one.

04:17.160 --> 04:24.840
It also seemed likely enough if you've got a critter with not much intelligence except in

04:24.840 --> 04:34.460
the direction of tool making and tool altering, then why not? The thing has to keep testing its

04:34.460 --> 04:40.820
ability or it will lose it. It might as well be designing something every time it needs a specific

04:40.820 --> 04:47.360
machine. Besides the ingenuity Niven demonstrated in creating the Modi's, he and Pornell also weaved

04:47.360 --> 04:52.280
some unexpected twists into the first contact theme. Our reader interested in aliens are more

04:52.280 --> 04:56.140
specifically in first contact. Can't afford to overlook the Moten Ghat's eye.

05:03.220 --> 05:07.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian based in Science

05:07.660 --> 05:11.900
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:54.820 --> 05:58.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:28.740 --> 06:28.820
This is the

06:29.460 --> 06:33.680
This is Daryl Lane and to Bill Vernon. The so-called New Wave in Science Fiction,

06:33.800 --> 06:37.460
which began in the mid 60s, was simply a new way of writing traditional science fiction.

06:38.120 --> 06:42.400
There were changes for instance and characterization was given more emphasis.

06:44.580 --> 06:47.020
Sex and religion that science fiction had really

06:48.120 --> 06:55.060
New Wave changed the stereotype science fiction formula since the pulp days of the 20s, 30s and 40s.

06:55.660 --> 06:59.840
Frederick Poll, who's been an author and editor and an agent in the field of science fiction,

07:00.260 --> 07:01.700
has something to say about that change.

07:02.920 --> 07:10.200
New Wave was an attempt to I guess 15 years ago or more of a number of writers to break away from

07:10.200 --> 07:15.020
the traditional types of fiction. In fact, most of them didn't want to call it science fiction or

07:15.780 --> 07:16.980
speculative fiction or

07:19.140 --> 07:24.420
and they were interested in writing about interstates,

07:26.040 --> 07:28.420
rolling a lot of them, taking flight.

07:32.600 --> 07:38.080
But in the rather bitter internal school with one author,

07:38.320 --> 07:43.840
a lot of people take sides one way or the other. I think every one of them would have done it.

07:52.660 --> 07:57.160
But we need to remember here that the New Wave wasn't really a planned and deliberate movement

07:57.160 --> 08:01.380
by a unified group of writers. One of the principal proponents of the New Wave,

08:01.800 --> 08:06.300
author Norman Spenred, believes it was just a bunch of diverse writers doing their own thing.

08:07.220 --> 08:11.960
It was an old way, but there was never as a coherent philosophy in school of science fiction,

08:11.960 --> 08:16.460
but there was never a New Wave in the same sense. There were a lot of ways. There are a lot of

08:16.460 --> 08:20.840
different people doing a lot of different things. The people that were identified as the New Wave

08:20.840 --> 08:27.020
were very diverse. What I was actually writing is very different to what Tom Dish was writing,

08:27.260 --> 08:33.260
or Balaard, or Zalazny, or Delaney were also identified as New Wave writers. This stuff is

08:33.920 --> 08:39.060
much more than, you know, Zalazny and Delaney and myself and Balaard and Ardison and Mike,

08:39.060 --> 08:50.040
but there were more differences between our work and the old stuff. There was more difference

08:50.040 --> 08:53.380
within the so-called New Wave than there was within the so-called old Wave.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.420
But Spenred also thinks the New Wave was tightly connected to what was happening in society.

08:59.680 --> 09:04.180
Of course, this mirrored the cultural climate at the time. It mirrored what was happening politically,

09:04.180 --> 09:07.940
it mirrored what was happening in music, it mirrored what was happening in movies,

09:08.200 --> 09:12.440
it was a phenomenon that went through the western civilizations at home.

09:19.020 --> 09:24.080
There are those who say the New Wave is dead. Five-time Hugo winner Larry Nivens says so,

09:24.160 --> 09:30.140
for instance, and offers a reason for his passing. The New Wave is a very persuasive thing,

09:30.730 --> 09:39.800
and very easy to use to justify bad stories. I think that's what killed it. Not the

09:40.700 --> 09:49.740
increased characterization and experiments with typography and story format are a bad thing

09:49.740 --> 09:56.600
in themselves, but it's so easy to use New Wave to justify a bad story. It was bound to go out.

10:02.700 --> 10:07.040
The influence of the New Wave is still around, though. It's left its mark on the field.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.860
Science fiction has been broadened, maybe enhanced somehow because of it.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.580
Frederick Paul states it well.

10:13.640 --> 10:18.540
And the New Wave, if nothing else, taught a bunch of old dinosaurs like Asimov and

10:19.940 --> 10:25.180
Heinlein and me, that there were non-traditional ways of constructing a novel.

10:25.180 --> 10:29.460
See, most of us had grown up when science fiction was in the pulp magazine,

10:29.660 --> 10:33.340
and most of it was written according to some variant of a pulp formula.

10:34.460 --> 10:39.780
Well, it's necessary. I think the New Wave is responsible for teaching us that.

10:47.320 --> 10:52.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

10:52.040 --> 10:55.840
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:40.260 --> 11:44.280
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.260
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.600
And here are your hosts.

12:13.920 --> 12:18.500
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. The award-winning novel Ringworld is probably

12:18.500 --> 12:23.500
Libby Niven's finest work. The Ringworld is an immense ring, large enough to hold 3 million

12:23.500 --> 12:28.780
Earths, and with a thousand-mile high wall to hold in its atmosphere. It also has continents and oceans.

12:29.460 --> 12:32.080
The Ringworld contains trillions of inhabitants of different species,

12:32.560 --> 12:37.180
and derives energy from the sun at its center. Niven recalls where he obtained the idea for such

12:37.180 --> 12:45.800
a fantastic structure. I ran across the concept Dyson's sphere. Dyson, the mathematician, came up

12:45.800 --> 12:50.880
with the concept Dyson's shell, and he was misunderstood to some extent. So,

12:51.680 --> 12:58.800
presently, I ran across an article about Dyson's sphere. A picture that is a golf ball, 93 million

12:58.800 --> 13:05.840
miles in radius, with a sun at the center, and gravity generators all around the outside, so

13:05.840 --> 13:12.860
he would live on the inside, terraform it with oceans and soil and air.

13:13.420 --> 13:20.760
I ran across that and I didn't like it. I thought it could be improved, and I wound up with the Ringworld.

13:27.840 --> 13:32.280
Reader studied the science behind the Ringworld and wrote Niven about seeming inconsistencies in

13:32.280 --> 13:39.100
the design of the immense artifact. Column errors and elaborations because some of them don't really

13:39.100 --> 13:43.360
fit the errors. It's just something that hadn't gotten into the original book.

13:44.140 --> 13:48.940
One of the errors was spotted by some MIT students. It had to do with the instability of the Ringworld.

13:49.740 --> 13:56.440
I suspected the Ringworld was unstable, and I suspected you'd eat attitude jets. I was sure that

13:56.440 --> 14:01.960
the Ringworld was spinning fast enough to permit bazaar and ram jets to be used as attitude jets,

14:02.060 --> 14:05.520
which means you don't have a fuel problem at all. You're burning the solar wind.

14:07.620 --> 14:13.320
But rapidly, some MIT people demonstrated that the Ringworld was unstable, and they were canning it

14:13.320 --> 14:19.260
in the halls at the next World Cup. The Ringworld is unstable. The Ringworld is unstable.

14:21.900 --> 14:27.980
It still took about seven years for anyone to figure out the exact numbers for the instability,

14:28.280 --> 14:34.560
and they are horrifying. The Ringworld, a major solar flare, would have the Ringworld

14:34.560 --> 14:41.480
grinding against its sun in five years. Well, I worked it in the plot. That was one

14:41.480 --> 14:48.160
elaboration or error. Even teenage readers analyzed his Ringworld with a critical scientific eye.

14:49.120 --> 14:55.200
A high school class in Florida got to work on the Ringworld, and their conclusion was that the

14:55.200 --> 15:00.860
Ringworld's worst problem is that all the top soil would wind up in the oceans in about 3,000 years.

15:01.500 --> 15:06.060
There are no earthquakes on the Ringworld. No mountain building forces.

15:13.060 --> 15:18.280
But in a sequel, Ringworld engineers niven attempted to correct such deficiencies.

15:18.660 --> 15:21.840
He devised a way to answer the criticism of the Florida high schoolers.

15:23.900 --> 15:32.220
Okay, that's a tough one. I set up a spill pipe system that runs the bottom from the

15:32.220 --> 15:40.300
sea bottoms under the Ringworld and up over the edge of the Ringwall. That even allows you some

15:40.300 --> 15:47.640
some mind accumulation of useful metals.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.920
Fan response of that sort caused Ringworld engineers to be written,

16:01.360 --> 16:04.320
and although Niven once said he wouldn't write anymore in the Known Space series,

16:04.800 --> 16:08.020
the body of stories to which Ringworld belongs, he's not so sure anymore.

16:09.460 --> 16:17.060
I've given up saying that the Known Space series is dead. There's just no point in it.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.600
I've written five books worth of Known Space stories since I said that.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.460
More on Larry Niven tomorrow.

16:30.480 --> 16:35.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:35.240 --> 16:39.080
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:22.100 --> 17:26.020
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:42.020 --> 17:47.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.600
And here are your hosts.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.380
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.660
He's one of the best-selling authors in the field of science fiction.

18:01.660 --> 18:04.960
A fairly large portion of his work falls into the Known Space series,

18:05.400 --> 18:08.000
a group of stories and novels with a consistent chronology.

18:08.540 --> 18:12.600
Such a series is called a Future History. Niven believes there are some peculiar

18:12.600 --> 18:15.300
attractions a Future History has for a science fiction author.

18:16.040 --> 18:22.600
There had been Future Histories around, Poole Anderson and Robert Heinlein.

18:24.540 --> 18:30.760
And I tell you, I guess we each evolved the idea somewhat independently.

18:31.200 --> 18:36.420
And the idea is that if you carved out a consistent workable future,

18:37.060 --> 18:39.800
it seems a shame to waste it on one story.

18:41.120 --> 18:47.920
You put it in the background because you want the background of a story to seem

18:48.480 --> 18:51.900
bigger than it is. So there are things that are simply unexplained.

18:53.320 --> 18:58.260
And if you think of more to say on a given subject, why you go with it?

18:58.440 --> 19:02.660
And if you think of a story that fits into the background of a previous story,

19:02.700 --> 19:04.860
it allows you to elaborate on that background.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.500
You sometimes you fall in love with the background.

19:08.060 --> 19:10.600
And presently you've got a bunch of stories that link.

19:22.240 --> 19:26.160
Niven has also written some bestselling books that fall outside his known space series.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.740
Three of these, The Mote in God's Eye, Lucifer's Hammer,

19:30.200 --> 19:33.140
and Oath of Fieldty were written in collaboration with Jerry Pranell.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.620
We asked Niven how he and Pranell collaborate.

19:36.740 --> 19:45.000
Hard sometimes, but it always resolves. The question is who is most qualified to write a

19:45.520 --> 19:51.440
that we have both decided needs writing. Before we start, we have the novel all laid out.

19:52.400 --> 19:57.640
We know what's going in virtually everywhere. And if we don't, it feels like we do.

19:58.620 --> 20:02.100
And if we find out we don't, we elaborate as we get to that section.

20:03.500 --> 20:08.160
Okay, the next question is who is qualified to write a given scene? Sometimes it's obvious.

20:09.060 --> 20:11.400
If we're dealing with a mad man, he's mine.

20:12.040 --> 20:15.780
If we're dealing with military operations, it's Jerry's.

20:15.860 --> 20:24.920
Aliens are generally mine. Politics is generally Jerry's. Knowledge of history, generally Jerry's.

20:25.300 --> 20:32.520
And a real evil son of a bitch, Jerry usually creates him. And I usually run with him afterwards.

20:41.660 --> 20:46.460
Niven occasionally writes science fiction humor, or rarity. He talks about his most successful

20:46.460 --> 20:55.840
piece of humor. I suppose I could name old man of steel woman of queen eggs, which has gotten me

20:55.840 --> 21:01.900
the most laughs. I suppose everybody seems to have read it. Those who haven't have heard about it

21:01.900 --> 21:07.900
in a cocktail party. Niven's ready eye for humor can also be appreciated as he reveals that he's

21:07.900 --> 21:13.040
detected one of his own alien creations from Ringworld, a Pearson's puppeteer here on Earth.

21:13.980 --> 21:17.180
I have reason to suspect the Faro puppeteers on Earth.

21:18.400 --> 21:24.240
Look at the characteristics. Forget the shape. They must be masters of biology that hide that

21:24.240 --> 21:29.900
peculiar three-legged two-headed shape. But consider their characteristics. They are cowards.

21:31.480 --> 21:37.440
That is, they want everything utterly safe. No corners on anything. Everything is soft,

21:37.440 --> 21:42.920
surfaces around the puppeteer world. They don't even keep their world near a sun,

21:43.380 --> 21:52.100
regarding it as a runaway fusion reactor, which of course it is. So, desperate regard for safety,

21:52.280 --> 22:02.100
they plus an urge to meddle in the lifestyles of other species. Driving urge to meddle with

22:03.260 --> 22:08.180
practically no restraints attached. What does that remind you of? It seems nearly

22:08.180 --> 22:11.000
certain to me that Ralph Nader is a Pearson's puppeteer.

22:18.240 --> 22:23.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction
