Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:27.980 --> 00:33.280
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.600
And here are your hosts.

00:41.960 --> 00:44.080
This is David Carson and Errol Lane.

00:44.500 --> 00:48.400
British-born author James P. Hogan has gained a reputation as one of the premier writers

00:48.400 --> 00:50.000
of hard science fiction working today.

00:50.540 --> 00:54.880
He's published seven novels so far, including In Here at the Stars, The Gentle Giants of

00:54.880 --> 00:59.940
Gain-A-Meade, Giant Star, Thrice Upon a Time, The Two Faces of Tomorrow, and his latest

00:59.940 --> 01:01.100
Voyage from yesteryear.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.040
Hogan tells us how he became an author.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.360
For

01:58.260 --> 02:03.140
20 years, Hogan worked as a systems designer for computers, then sold computers to scientists

02:03.140 --> 02:04.460
for use in their research.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.960
Associating with scientists as he did, Hogan was exposed to all sorts of current scientific

02:08.960 --> 02:13.260
research, and he would make use of his scientific context when he began to write seriously.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.340
The chances were 10 to 1.

02:45.520 --> 02:50.120
I had a customer specializing in that field, and I just had to, if I needed some background

02:50.500 --> 02:55.040
information on a particular topic, I could almost guarantee I had a phone number in my

02:55.040 --> 02:57.260
diary as a guy who could talk all day about it.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.200
And they loved doing it, as well.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.700
I used to call them, and they'd say, I'd like to come and talk to you tomorrow.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.380
Well, we're a little busy, but what's it about?

03:07.620 --> 03:10.400
Oh, I need some help with the book I'm working on.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.460
Well, why didn't you say so?

03:11.600 --> 03:12.540
What times do you want to show up?

03:12.540 --> 03:13.960
I may talk all day.

03:15.020 --> 03:26.160
I think this is one of the interesting sites of selling computers into this kind of area.

03:26.380 --> 03:33.340
You can imagine some of these specialists, they talk to bacteria all day long or whatever,

03:33.620 --> 03:36.420
and they end up shutting the back rooms of universities.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.440
And maybe there are four people on the planet they can talk to who understand their language.

03:41.440 --> 03:50.260
And sometimes they find it hard to believe that somebody from the world outside that

03:50.260 --> 03:55.920
has walked in off the street is sincerely interested to sit down and talk to them.

03:56.120 --> 04:00.300
And he's curious, and he wants to know what they're doing, wants to have it explained.

04:01.540 --> 04:06.200
So, writing about his experiences with scientists, Hogan found that he was a science fiction writer.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.820
I didn't particularly set out to be a science fiction writer.

04:12.060 --> 04:13.440
I suppose I became one by accident.

04:14.260 --> 04:19.000
I just always wanted to write and started writing stories about the little bit of life

04:19.000 --> 04:24.560
that I'd had some personal experience of, and was told I was a science fiction writer,

04:24.700 --> 04:25.460
and I said, how's that?

04:25.780 --> 04:29.720
And they said, well, the publisher is publishing it under their science fiction imprint,

04:29.900 --> 04:30.860
so we guess you have to be.

04:30.980 --> 04:31.620
So I said, OK.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.480
And it kind of started out like that.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.520
Hogan's books are scientifically accurate and highly realistic.

04:38.980 --> 04:41.680
He's been called the man who put science back into science fiction.

04:42.060 --> 04:44.620
Next time we'll talk to James P. Hogan about some of his novels.

04:52.020 --> 04:56.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

04:56.700 --> 05:00.520
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.340
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:00.980 --> 06:06.260
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:09.290 --> 06:10.560
And here are your hosts.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.000
This is Daryl Lane.

06:16.220 --> 06:16.840
And David Carson.

06:17.220 --> 06:22.120
James P. Hogan's 1977 science fiction novel, Inherit the Stars, should be required reading

06:22.120 --> 06:25.160
for anyone who demands scientific accuracy in an exciting narrative.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.500
The book takes place some 50 years in the future.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.160
A skeleton inside a space suit is found on the moon.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.240
That's interesting enough, but what follows is even more provocative.

06:33.880 --> 06:37.280
The skeleton is a human one, and it's been on the moon for 50,000 years.

06:37.620 --> 06:40.900
The scientific unraveling of this mystery forms the basis of the novel.

06:41.420 --> 06:44.800
It's like a detective story, and Hogan talks about the origins of the idea.

06:46.520 --> 06:51.680
2001 was one of the factors that inspired me to write Inherit the Stars.

06:52.060 --> 06:58.740
I loved the idea of something being found, a mystery, being uncovered in the course of

06:58.740 --> 07:05.680
lunar exploration that was sufficiently intriguing to motivate a lot of scientists into unraveling

07:05.680 --> 07:05.800
it.

07:06.600 --> 07:14.620
It seemed a good opportunity to set the scientific detective story that I wanted to write.

07:15.320 --> 07:19.400
You know, okay, let's have the detective story, or the mystery that the detectives are trying

07:19.400 --> 07:23.300
to solve hinge around something that's turned up on the moon.

07:24.020 --> 07:27.880
Well, dead bodies are always pretty good for detective stories.

07:30.180 --> 07:35.200
It ought to be a more interesting dead body than the standard detective thriller.

07:35.200 --> 07:40.860
So let's make it 50,000 years old in human, which raises the whole, opens up the whole

07:40.860 --> 07:43.720
bag of words, and let's just see how they unravel that.

07:44.180 --> 07:54.540
I wanted the ending to be a bit of a twist, a bit unexpected, a bit of a surprise, but

07:54.540 --> 07:57.880
nevertheless plausible and rational within the context of the story.

07:57.880 --> 08:07.240
I didn't want to bring in mystical agencies or strange laws of physics or anything like

08:07.240 --> 08:08.660
this to hold it together.

08:09.540 --> 08:14.400
The entire scientific community of Earth starts to work on the baffling problem of the space-suited

08:14.400 --> 08:17.120
50,000-year-old human skeleton, which they name Charlie.

08:17.700 --> 08:22.820
They soon find remnants on the moon of Charlie's culture, a map of an unfamiliar planet, scraps

08:22.820 --> 08:26.720
of Charlie's diary in an unfamiliar language, and some technological artifacts.

08:26.720 --> 08:31.460
With such clues, the scientists begin to piece together the incredible story of who Charlie

08:31.460 --> 08:32.780
was and why he was human.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.220
Hogan says the book sort of defines what science is all about.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.120
It counters some of the distorted images of scientists Hogan has seen in fiction.

08:41.460 --> 08:46.240
Scientists were always eccentric and they wore odd colored shoes and they drew cabbages

08:46.240 --> 08:49.360
that ate people and they wanted to conquer the world or something.

08:49.360 --> 08:58.260
And there are these cute public impressions of scientists as people who run down the street

08:58.260 --> 09:00.500
with no clothes on shouting Eureka.

09:06.740 --> 09:16.580
Or you read phrases like it came to him in a flash and you read on and what came to him

09:16.580 --> 09:20.200
in a flash would have been enough to keep Einstein busy for the next 20 years.

09:21.440 --> 09:28.760
And real science, you know, there are insights, there are strokes of genius, but the overwhelming

09:29.860 --> 09:35.660
bulk of the work is done by a lot of unsung heroes, a lot of people doing nothing really

09:35.660 --> 09:42.160
dramatic or exciting but just meticulously sifting through details, collecting information.

09:43.360 --> 09:47.020
For generations and for centuries, all different parts of the world.

09:47.720 --> 09:53.640
And it's really like putting together a huge jigsaw puzzle, lots of people cutting out pieces

09:53.640 --> 09:58.460
and pushing them around and every now and again somebody will take a huge chunk in this corner

09:58.460 --> 10:01.780
and see that it fits with a huge chunk down there and that's a breakthrough.

10:02.380 --> 10:03.280
And so it goes on.

10:03.860 --> 10:06.520
And it really is a detective story.

10:06.860 --> 10:09.440
I think it's a far more exciting one than most detective fiction.

10:09.980 --> 10:14.920
We strongly recommend you read Inherit the Stars to find out the solution to the mystery surrounding Charlie.

10:15.340 --> 10:21.420
Hogan wrote two sequels to Inherit the Stars and all three form a trilogy that presents an awesome view of man's origins.

10:21.980 --> 10:24.320
Next time we'll talk with Hogan about those other two books.

10:31.440 --> 10:36.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:36.740 --> 10:39.900
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:25.260 --> 11:29.160
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:44.880 --> 11:50.140
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.440
And here are your hosts.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.620
This is David Carson.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.540
And Daryl Lane.

12:01.540 --> 12:07.760
James P. Hogan's Science Fiction novel Inherit the Stars was popular enough with readers to justify a sequel, two of them in fact.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.800
The first was entitled A Gentle Giant's of Ganymede and it was published in 1978.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.060
Hogan explains why he wrote the book.

12:14.900 --> 12:20.440
When I wrote Inherit the Stars I had three books in mind. I had a trilogy in mind.

12:21.500 --> 12:30.800
So I put the hooks in, although Inherit the Stars was a complete story in itself, it didn't leave the reader hanging.

12:31.140 --> 12:33.820
It started and told and finished a story.

12:34.340 --> 12:42.740
Nevertheless, there were a couple of hooks in there that invited some questions, which were paved the way to a follow-up book.

12:45.420 --> 12:59.040
And my thinking at the time was, I'll go that far, but I won't write the second book until I have some feedback as to how the readers liked the first one.

12:59.720 --> 13:04.760
And I got a lot of mail and they all liked it and a lot of them said in their letters, will there be a follow-up?

13:04.880 --> 13:05.920
They picked out the hooks.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.360
So I wrote The Gentle Giant's.

13:09.120 --> 13:13.660
The Gentle Giant's of the title are a race of aliens that first turned up in Inherit the Stars.

13:14.200 --> 13:19.520
In that book, scientists from Earth had discovered a wrecked spaceship on Ganymede, one of Jupiter's huge moons.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.760
And on it were the remains of prehistoric creatures from Earth, dinosaurs and the like.

13:24.700 --> 13:33.400
In The Gentle Giant's of Ganymede, humans meet some live Ganymens who have returned to the solar system after a mishap in space kept them away for some 25 million years due to time dilation.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.100
It turns out that the Ganymiens had been responsible for human evolution.

13:37.100 --> 13:42.400
They'd taken primitive hominids from Earth 25 million years ago and moved them to a planet called Minerva.

13:43.180 --> 13:51.200
Minerva was then one of the inner planets of our solar system, but it was destroyed in a tremendous war involving the human stock that had evolved from the Ganymien experiments.

13:52.300 --> 14:00.120
The second book ends with the Ganymiens leaving the solar system in search of their own people, who migrated from Minerva millions of years before the war that destroyed the planet.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.500
Hogan says readers wanted a third book.

14:03.920 --> 14:09.380
And they wanted another one and I did have a trilogy in mind when I wrote it.

14:09.540 --> 14:16.100
And the third one in that series is now written. It's called Giant Star and it will be, it's a July title.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.400
So it should start to appear in the bookstores around June.

14:20.700 --> 14:23.760
It's the third and last. There won't be any more in that series.

14:24.880 --> 14:29.700
So it ties up a few of the loose ends, tells another story.

14:33.160 --> 14:42.100
It continues with the characters we met in the previous two books, both the terrestrial and the alien characters, and introduces some new ones.

14:43.300 --> 14:48.300
And I don't think there can be a fourth one because it really, I don't think there's any more to be said. It wraps it all up.

14:53.500 --> 15:00.060
Giant Star was published in 1981 and as Hogan said, it wraps up all the mysteries and loose ends raised in the first two books.

15:00.560 --> 15:10.240
And it presents an absolutely breathtaking concept of man's origins, explaining also where man gets his curious nature, his aggressiveness, and his incredible instinct for survival.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.100
Hogan talks about the underlying purpose of the whole trilogy.

15:14.900 --> 15:21.360
Basically it was an attempt to depict science as it is, or at least as I perceive it.

15:22.000 --> 15:33.180
And at the same time we've got into a story that people who were non-scientists, non-specialists would find stimulating and arousing for the curiosity,

15:34.060 --> 15:42.960
even if, you know, without trying to turn it into a 250 page lab report or something like that.

15:43.520 --> 15:52.140
And stimulating the books certainly are. For sheer grandeur, the whole Minervan trilogy, as some have called it, is matched by a few other works in the field of science fiction.

15:52.600 --> 15:57.920
Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy comes to mind as a comparison, as does Olaf Stapledon's Odd John.

15:58.560 --> 16:06.320
James B. Hogan's Inherit the Stars, the General Giants of Ganymede, and Giant Star. Contemporary science fiction has little to offer that's any better.

16:13.500 --> 16:22.060
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:06.440 --> 17:10.360
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:26.060 --> 17:35.640
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy. And here are your hosts.

17:39.960 --> 17:45.160
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Time travel is one of the traditional themes of science fiction.

17:45.740 --> 17:52.160
One of the best, certainly one of the most realistic time travel books, is James Hogan's Thrice Upon a Time, which came out in 1980.

17:52.160 --> 17:59.960
But for some time, for a number of years, in fact, before I wrote Thrice Upon a Time, I'd been wanting to write a time travel book for a number of reasons.

18:00.840 --> 18:25.400
Firstly, I wanted to attempt to face up to the paradoxes, the logical paradoxes, once and for all, and answer them, without top-outs, without convenient coincidences, and without obliging characters who just happened to do the right thing to make everything come out the way the author said.

18:29.920 --> 18:42.580
Secondly, I wanted to get away from this kind of cliche of some kind of a conjurer's box, described or disguised as whatever, that you jump into and you jump out of and you're in some other time.

18:44.220 --> 18:56.000
We seem too many conjurers' boxes and it seemed to me unrealistic. If I ever build a box like that and I thought it was going to take me to another time, I certainly would jump into it and press the button.

18:57.020 --> 19:02.120
I would conduct a long series of tests and experiments first and none of that here I've ever seen to do this.

19:02.920 --> 19:07.700
Hogan wanted to avoid some of the cliches or formulas that characterized most time travel stories.

19:07.700 --> 19:26.160
I think in too many stories, time machines are used like starships. They're just a device, a vehicle, to get some characters into an unusual environment and then tell a pretty routine story that would stole them from Greek mythology or European medieval history.

19:26.160 --> 19:32.800
The technology doesn't come into the story at all. They could have gone the on a greyhound bus. I didn't want to do that.

19:33.340 --> 19:54.780
The story was about some physicists who had stumbled upon this phenomenon and had realized that if what they were seeing meant what they thought it meant, it meant that they could actually inject information into the past and change the past, with all the questions that it implies.

19:58.200 --> 20:05.700
And proceeded to test this phenomenon and obtained some very, very strange results.

20:06.640 --> 20:12.180
The strange thing the physicists learn is that they can send messages into the past, not far into the past, maybe just 10 minutes.

20:12.960 --> 20:22.540
I didn't want it to be a million years or a billion years or some huge span of time where really nothing that you did could make any difference.

20:22.660 --> 20:30.920
How about a lab bench experiment? 10 minutes. You can just send a little signal back to yourself 10 minutes ago and change what you've already done.

20:31.240 --> 20:40.640
This is interesting. You're hard up against the paradoxes now. You can't find a way around them or duck them. You've got to answer the question, what happens?

20:41.520 --> 20:49.420
The logic of the whole situation becomes absolutely, it drives you to the point of insanity trying to figure it out.

20:50.400 --> 20:57.000
It was the logic and the science implied by the time travel theme that fascinated Hogan. He wanted to approach the concept realistically.

20:57.480 --> 21:03.260
And it's so realistic that you feel after reading the book, you could go down to Radio Shack and buy the parts to make a time travel machine.

21:03.780 --> 21:08.820
Recently, a number of responsible scientists have been speculating on the actual possibility of time travel.

21:09.460 --> 21:13.720
We asked Hogan if he thought it would ever be a reality and if his book was meant to be prophetic.

21:14.840 --> 21:24.400
Well, I don't know whether it's prophetic or not. Well, as is elaborated in the book itself, if something like that ever became a fact,

21:24.400 --> 21:35.620
there are some pretty interesting problems that are going to have to be solved and our ideas of logic and cause and effect are going to have to undergo some pretty interesting revisions.

21:36.120 --> 21:42.440
So I'm certainly not setting myself up as a prophet saying yes, it will happen. Maybe, I don't know.

21:42.520 --> 21:49.600
I think history has shown that impossible or it will never happen are very dangerous phrases to use in any context.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.220
More with James P. Hogan next time.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:13.420 --> 23:18.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.020
And here are your hosts.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.400
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

23:29.880 --> 23:35.540
Of all science fiction writers working today, no one surpasses James P. Hogan in scientific accuracy and realism.

23:35.860 --> 23:40.420
Hogan's publisher, Ballantine Books, has advertised him as the man who put science back in science fiction.

23:40.900 --> 23:46.380
And after reading books like Thrice Upon a Time and The Two Faces of Tomorrow, you realize how much he deserves that description.

23:46.380 --> 23:53.620
Hogan is also concerned with realism, with the kind of everyday detail that makes his story even though it's set in the future, a totally believable one.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.240
He explains why realistic detail is important.

24:16.380 --> 24:17.760
I'm not sure if he's going to get it if he needs to render CAD.

24:18.920 --> 24:27.020
These matter because if the story is being told in the future, the whole of the background has to be consistently futuristic.

24:29.520 --> 24:37.360
I've come across a number of instances which in my opinion are a little flawed because I've dealt with an AW.

24:39.580 --> 24:48.360
A writer may have seized on a particular thought, maybe a new scientific idea or a machine or whatever,

24:49.540 --> 24:52.700
and developed that very well, but kind of gets hung up on it.

24:52.980 --> 24:57.460
And in the background, everything else that's going on hasn't changed since 1980.

25:01.180 --> 25:06.620
And trying to, I think, just stop typing for the five minutes it takes just to think about a situation.

25:06.840 --> 25:10.160
The guy's going to make a phone call just like stop and think how he might make that.

25:12.160 --> 25:24.180
And think about it for five minutes and then maybe show it in a way different to what would have been the impulsive thing to do in the first couple of seconds.

25:32.800 --> 25:37.020
Hogan says that his readers appreciate his attention to realistic detail and accuracy.

25:37.320 --> 25:41.420
In fact, he thinks he attracts some readers who don't normally read science fiction because of it.

25:42.540 --> 25:53.960
From the people who write to me and the people that I meet, one of the gratifying things I observe in the readership that I have is that

25:53.960 --> 26:05.480
it is not confined to what might be termed the hardcore science fiction reader who buys anything new that appears on the science fiction section of the bookstores.

26:06.440 --> 26:14.920
But a lot of, I suppose, people who might be termed younger professional people in their late 20s, 30s, 40s,

26:14.920 --> 26:21.500
in all manner of professions, not necessarily to do with the scientists, teachers, lawyers, doctors, so forth,

26:22.980 --> 26:32.060
who typically would say, gee, I used to read science fiction when I was at college or when I was at university, but I kind of grew out of it.

26:33.220 --> 26:38.680
I can't relate the way out galaxies light years away anymore or aliens running around with ray guns.

26:39.520 --> 26:44.800
Today I have a family, a career, a mortgage, my feet are solidly on the surface of this planet.

26:45.560 --> 26:53.100
But they seem to like stories that don't kind of try and take them to the other side of the universe a million years from now,

26:53.140 --> 26:55.700
but maybe just stretch the future 20 or 30 years.

26:56.240 --> 27:05.440
I may find names in the book like IBM and Avis and Boeing, familiar places, and it kind of grabs them.

27:05.740 --> 27:10.880
They say, well, this I can relate to, it's the world that I live in just stretched a little bit.

27:10.880 --> 27:17.540
The connection is not broken, the economics and the politics have evolved from what I read in the papers, I can still see the connections.

27:18.260 --> 27:21.440
And it could be the world my kids go up in, and I like it.

27:22.380 --> 27:28.320
Hogan's latest novel, Voyage from yesteryear, is further in the future than his other books, and the field of action is much broader,

27:28.600 --> 27:30.300
but it's typically Hogan and his credibility.

27:31.020 --> 27:35.260
If you haven't been exposed to James P. Hogan's brand of science fiction, you're missing something.

27:42.340 --> 27:47.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

27:47.840 --> 27:51.000
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
