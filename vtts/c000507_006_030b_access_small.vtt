Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.520 --> 00:33.800
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.100
And here are your hosts.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.900
This is Daryl Lane and David Cruz.

00:45.260 --> 00:48.920
Norman Spenrad has strong opinions about science fiction in its place in today's world.

00:49.340 --> 00:53.200
As a noted author who helped bring the science fiction new wave to this country, and as a

00:53.200 --> 00:57.080
two-time president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, Spenrad's ideas should

00:57.080 --> 00:57.540
be heard.

00:57.940 --> 01:01.160
One thing he feels strongly about is that science fiction has not been treated fairly

01:01.160 --> 01:01.900
by book reviewers.

01:02.700 --> 01:11.380
As a category, it is treated very unfairly and very cavalierly by the powers that be,

01:11.460 --> 01:17.700
which is mainly the New York Times book review and the New York Review of Books and the so-called

01:17.700 --> 01:21.680
New York Literary Establishment, which really does have a very heavy effect on the way books

01:21.680 --> 01:22.040
are published.

01:22.820 --> 01:27.560
These people, for instance, came down on the American Book Awards, succeeded in getting

01:27.560 --> 01:29.820
science fiction knocked out of the American Book Awards.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.520
As president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, Spenrad has worked for some changes

01:55.520 --> 01:56.120
in the field.

02:50.520 --> 02:54.980
He thinks general readers should be made more aware of science fiction's unique possibilities

02:54.980 --> 02:56.340
and its genuine value.

02:56.680 --> 03:00.500
We asked him if science fiction movies have a positive or negative influence on the public's

03:00.500 --> 03:01.300
image of the field.

03:02.360 --> 03:15.040
I don't think they detract from it either.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.980
If there are some better, more sophisticated movies, they might help.

03:19.060 --> 03:23.580
As it is, it's just kind of neutral publicity, people more aware that it exists.

03:23.780 --> 03:28.780
I think it's positive and will prove to be positive in the long-range because a lot

03:28.780 --> 03:32.520
of people are being introduced to the imagery of science fiction, with which they are unfamiliar

03:32.520 --> 03:33.640
through these movies.

03:34.720 --> 03:38.780
If you look at the evolution in the movies, you find that in the earlier science fiction

03:38.780 --> 03:42.820
movies, if you're going into space or whatever, you had to spend like half an hour setting

03:42.820 --> 03:43.240
a thing.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.640
This is a spaceship that takes off from the Earth.

03:45.820 --> 03:46.840
People float around it.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.820
You have to familiarize the audience with all this unfamiliar imagery.

03:51.060 --> 03:54.720
Now they can just start a movie bang right off, in a galaxy far away.

03:55.060 --> 03:55.240
Boom.

03:55.980 --> 03:57.820
Here's a spaceship in the stromo pow.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.400
In other words, the first half hour of the conventional old-time science fiction movie

04:01.400 --> 04:04.100
is gone because people are now familiar with this imagery.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.960
I think these movies have brought a lot of new people into familiarity with these images.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.560
They made these images part of the popular culture.

04:13.740 --> 04:18.240
These movies were mainly aimed at kids and adolescents.

04:19.200 --> 04:24.480
Years from now, assuming that these people ever read anything, they'll be ready to read

04:24.480 --> 04:30.080
science fiction of a more serious kind, assuming they're ready to read literature of a more

04:30.080 --> 04:34.540
serious kind at all, because they'll be familiar with the material, familiar with the literature.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.820
It won't seem strange and weird to them because they will have grown up with it.

04:38.300 --> 04:43.760
That's why I think magazines, even magazines like Star-Log say, in that sense will have

04:43.760 --> 04:45.320
a long-term positive impact.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.680
More with Norman Spinrad on our next show.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.980
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

04:59.980 --> 05:04.140
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:48.860 --> 05:52.740
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:08.360 --> 06:13.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.880
And here are your hosts.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.900
This is David Cruz.

06:24.180 --> 06:24.820
And Daryl Lane.

06:25.200 --> 06:29.640
Norman Spinrad's best-known novel may be Bug Jack Barron, a book which has stirred controversy

06:29.640 --> 06:31.040
in both England and America.

06:31.460 --> 06:35.340
It was published in this country in 1969, and it's a different sort of science fiction

06:35.340 --> 06:35.660
novel.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.100
It's a good example of new wave science fiction.

06:38.520 --> 06:42.800
Character and style are important, and it deals with social issues such as racism, the

06:42.800 --> 06:46.140
establishment, drugs, the power of the media, and radical protests.

06:46.140 --> 06:50.260
There is also a good deal of sex and violence in the book, and the language is highly colored.

06:50.620 --> 06:54.400
But Spinrad, thanks to the plot of the book, conforms to traditional science fiction formulas.

06:55.860 --> 06:59.740
Actually, what I was trying to do in a way, the book has a very traditional plot.

07:00.280 --> 07:04.180
As far as I was concerned, it has a positive hero, it has a negative villain.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.060
The hero wins, the villain loses.

07:06.260 --> 07:11.160
All that stuff that is considered the traditional way of plotting a book.

07:11.780 --> 07:13.860
And yet it's written in a different kind of way.

07:13.860 --> 07:19.340
It kind of takes that superficial kind of plot and treats it in a realistic manner.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.620
The protagonist, Jack Barron, is a powerfully influential television star who has a talk

07:24.620 --> 07:26.260
show watched by 100 million people.

07:26.900 --> 07:30.100
He uses the show as a battlefield to oppose corrupt elements of society.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.580
Spinrad comments on Barron's use of power.

07:33.700 --> 07:37.300
The book is about power.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.140
It's about power itself as neutral as far as I'm concerned.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.600
That's what people do with it that counts.

07:43.440 --> 07:48.860
Barron is a guy who likes power and keeps referring to it as a drug.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.940
And knows that he can become addicted to it.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.260
And for that reason, has decided to stay away from it.

07:55.940 --> 08:00.860
Then he gets drawn back into playing with power because he comes to the conclusion that

08:00.860 --> 08:05.760
it's better for somebody who feels that way about power to be wielding it, than people

08:05.760 --> 08:09.360
who don't have any self-consciousness about the dangers of wielding power.

08:09.960 --> 08:15.780
So in that sense, it's a comment on the power of the media, but it's also a comment on the

08:16.240 --> 08:23.160
morality of power, on the paradox of power, which is that if you leave power to be wielded

08:23.720 --> 08:29.100
by people who do not see the dangers, the personal dangers, the psychological dangers

08:29.100 --> 08:33.320
of being involved with it, then you end up with people like Benedict Howard, Ronald Reagan,

08:33.320 --> 08:40.820
and Richard Nixon who do not have self-consciousness about the personal dangers, the moral dangers

08:40.820 --> 08:42.820
of chasing after power.

08:42.940 --> 08:47.820
Whereas somebody like Barron, who is certainly an imperfect person, as all people are, at

08:47.820 --> 08:53.840
least his saving grace, if he has one, is that he is well aware of the personal dangers

08:53.840 --> 08:57.840
of being involved in a quest for power.

08:58.820 --> 09:02.340
When Spinrad tried to get the novel published in this country, he was unsuccessful.

09:02.340 --> 09:03.380
So he tried and written.

09:03.900 --> 09:07.580
But there was an outcry in Parliament against the book. He relates the story for us.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.500
That novel had a lot of trouble. It was written under contract at double day.

09:11.620 --> 09:16.560
They then rejected it. You have to remember the political climate of the era.

09:16.940 --> 09:20.900
They didn't reject it. They said, we'll publish it if you cut out all the sex, all the swear words,

09:20.980 --> 09:24.500
and all the politics, which was the whole book.

09:25.740 --> 09:30.580
So it took a long time to resell that book here. In the meantime, I took it to Wilfred,

09:30.580 --> 09:33.220
to a Wilfred conference, and Mike Murcock was there.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.540
He read it, he locked it, and he serialized it in New World.

09:35.620 --> 09:39.020
So the first publication was actually in England, in the magazine.

09:40.920 --> 09:45.520
Now, halfway through the serialization, I forget exactly which part, Part 3, Part 4,

09:46.080 --> 09:50.520
W. H. Smith, which was the biggest distributor, still is the biggest distributor in England,

09:51.100 --> 09:53.800
refused to distribute the magazine because of the book in it.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.940
Now at that time, New World had an arts council grant.

09:56.940 --> 09:59.520
The arts council was in the organ of the British government.

10:00.640 --> 10:04.220
Now the arts council supported the magazine against Smith publicly.

10:05.260 --> 10:09.480
And so the flap in Parliament arose when certain right wing members of Parliament

10:09.480 --> 10:15.360
were aghast that an organ of the British government, the arts council, was defending this kind of stuff.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.620
And that's how it became a parliamentary issue.

10:19.940 --> 10:23.800
Bugjack Baron is being made into a movie, with a screenplay by Harlan Ellison

10:23.800 --> 10:27.320
and direction by radical filmmaker Costa Gavras. It should be interesting.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.660
More with Norman Spinrad next time.

10:36.700 --> 10:42.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

10:42.400 --> 10:45.240
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.640
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:50.300 --> 11:55.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.740
And here are your hosts.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.420
This is Daryl Lane. And David Cruz.

12:06.860 --> 12:11.500
Norman Spinrad's 1979 science fiction novel, A World Between, signaled a change in his fiction.

12:11.800 --> 12:16.800
Spinrad's early work usually contained either subtle or overt criticism of various aspects of society.

12:16.800 --> 12:21.600
Bugjack Baron, the men in the jungle and agent of chaos are good examples of this type.

12:21.980 --> 12:25.800
A World Between is also a socially-oriented novel, but there's a different element in it.

12:26.140 --> 12:26.760
Spinrad explains.

12:27.960 --> 12:38.940
I would say in general that up until, I guess, A World Between really, a lot of my stuff was kind of critical.

12:39.200 --> 12:45.040
Critical of this, of existing societies, critical of various things that were going on.

12:45.040 --> 12:50.440
A World Between is meant as a utopian novel, really, in a kind of way.

12:50.660 --> 12:52.480
And it's a prescriptive kind of book.

12:53.200 --> 12:57.740
It's more of a, instead of presenting critical images of other things,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.840
the idea is to create a more positive image of a more positive kind of future.

13:03.020 --> 13:05.460
I think if you spend enough time criticizing what exists,

13:07.820 --> 13:14.800
at some point you have some kind of moral obligation to present something more positive and replaceably.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.220
To replace what you find negative.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.500
The setting for the novel is a fit one for a utopia.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.640
It takes place on the planet Pacifica, a beautiful world of blue ocean and lush green islands that's been colonized by humans.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.280
Inhabitants of Pacifica live private lives in their isolated islands.

13:34.820 --> 13:38.180
There are no large urban centers to cause pollution, overpopulation or poverty.

13:38.680 --> 13:43.380
Even though they are physically isolated, the Pacificans remain in close electronic contact with one another.

13:43.380 --> 13:49.320
They govern themselves, in fact, with a tight media web that allows them to vote immediately on any issue of importance.

13:49.620 --> 13:53.220
But into this idyllic world comes two opposed political forces from Earth,

13:53.320 --> 13:55.660
bent on the ideological conquest of Pacifica.

13:55.980 --> 13:58.440
One force is the Institute for Transcendental Science,

13:58.840 --> 14:02.580
a powerful organization whose goal is galactic unity under their control.

14:03.060 --> 14:06.180
They are extreme, and Spinrad says they have two basic flaws.

14:07.460 --> 14:12.300
One is the unexamined subtle male, male chauvinist bias of their culture.

14:12.300 --> 14:23.120
And the other one is the ultimate conviction that what they are doing is the absolute most important thing in the universe.

14:23.420 --> 14:31.500
And therefore they are morally entitled to run over other people's cultures and desires.

14:33.060 --> 14:40.980
Absolutism, I guess, would be the kind of theocratic absolutism would be their flaw.

14:40.980 --> 14:45.460
The other force is the Femocrats, a militant women's liberation group that is also an extreme.

14:46.040 --> 14:50.640
The struggle of these two groups for control of planets all across the galaxy is called the Pink and Blue War.

14:50.940 --> 14:57.060
It's clearly a male-female conflict, and so far every planet the two sides have approached has ended up on one side or the other.

14:57.540 --> 15:01.260
But Pacifica is different. Spinrad's utopia is a stable and intelligent one.

15:01.800 --> 15:06.040
The Pacificans reject both extremes and even change the minds of a few of the combatants.

15:06.040 --> 15:11.400
We asked Spinrad about reactions to the book. How did women, for instance, respond to the Femocratic women's livers?

15:12.640 --> 15:27.340
The strange thing about the reaction to that book has been that a certain number of men have reacted in a kind of male liberal guilt, male feminist kind of reaction against that.

15:27.900 --> 15:32.760
But at most part women have liked the book. Women have identified with it more than men.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.700
And actually I even got one or two good reviews in feminist places.

15:38.660 --> 15:42.100
I think that's not quite what I expected, but that seems to be the way it happened.

15:42.280 --> 15:46.680
I have not gotten heavy feminist flanks from that a little bit, but not much.

15:46.860 --> 15:59.400
Not much because I think women who are involved in feminism or have been, or know women who are, can recognize a certain aspect of the feminist movement in the Femocrats.

15:59.400 --> 16:03.960
Whereas men who are trying to show how liberator they are would not dream of admitting such a thing.

16:04.560 --> 16:09.200
A world between. A different sort of book for Norman Spinrad, and we'll have more on him tomorrow.

16:16.340 --> 16:24.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

16:43.760 --> 16:59.380
Thank you for watching.

17:08.980 --> 17:12.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

17:33.340 --> 17:37.920
and here are your hosts.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.100
This is David Cruz.

17:44.420 --> 17:45.100
And Daryl Lane.

17:45.360 --> 17:50.320
Norman Spinrad's most recent novel, Songs from the Stars, was published by Simon and Schuster in 1980.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.680
The book describes a fragmented future society in a world devastated by nuclear war.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.900
This, of course, is a typical Spinrad theme.

17:56.900 --> 18:04.560
But the novel also communicates the sense of wonder characteristic of good science fiction when it describes the marvels of contact with an alien civilization.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.780
Society has split in two factions in Songs from the Stars.

18:08.260 --> 18:16.100
One faction is an Aquarian society which bans all technology, in fact anything having to do with science, since this was what was responsible for almost destroying the Earth.

18:16.480 --> 18:23.460
And the other faction are the black scientists who keep technology alive and maintain an illicit smuggling operation with the Aquarian Society.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.760
Spinrad talks about these opposed factions.

19:01.320 --> 19:05.600
It's a book about horror unity, I guess.

19:07.060 --> 19:10.480
As usual, with Spinrad, the book's conflict reflects current social conditions.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.860
And then, you know, a mirror is the present thing in our society.

19:14.140 --> 19:20.500
Where on the one hand you have a great big space movement, people wanting to get into space, and all the old people and all that stuff.

19:20.580 --> 19:29.900
On the other hand you have a real atavistic, neo-Luddite movement, an anti-nuclear movement which is really kind of willfully ignorant of a lot of things.

19:31.740 --> 19:35.820
In a way, these are the two things that could bring about the crash.

19:38.940 --> 19:41.080
And as well as what with some armaments.

19:41.280 --> 19:46.840
So I think it's basically a book about the grand philosophical attempt at apoc.

19:46.880 --> 19:53.680
Is to try and bridge the gap between science and reason and feeling emotion and mysticism.

19:54.680 --> 19:59.900
And to point to a horror unity between the two things.

19:59.900 --> 20:06.160
And away from the false dichotomies and false dualisms, which seem to be really destroying Western civilization.

20:06.380 --> 20:11.860
The protagonist in the book is a laid back Aquarian, clear blue loo.

20:12.340 --> 20:15.780
Along with his girl and a scientist, he travels up to a satellite circling the Earth.

20:16.260 --> 20:21.880
There are the three of them receive communication from some incredibly advanced alien civilizations in another part of the galaxy.

20:22.440 --> 20:29.480
With the knowledge sent by the helpful aliens, it seems the humans will solve their own problems, unite, and start progressing toward the stars once more.

20:29.480 --> 20:35.540
We asked Spinrad that if and when we contact an alien civilization, is it likely they will be helpful rather than hostile?

20:37.340 --> 20:43.260
As I said in the book, I do believe that any civilization that's going to last a million years,

20:43.380 --> 20:47.120
it's going to be a million years or whatever, or even a hundred thousand years more advanced than us,

20:47.420 --> 20:50.720
they've been around that much longer, had that much more advanced science.

20:51.600 --> 20:58.200
If it's going to survive to that length of its own history, it's got to solve it, you know, it's got to be by that time.

20:59.320 --> 21:03.300
Philosophically and emotionally pretty together, or who long since it destroyed itself.

21:03.560 --> 21:10.040
I mean, we certainly will not survive a million years of our own history if it continues as it has, you know.

21:10.660 --> 21:14.580
In order that any civilization that survives a million years of its own history,

21:14.660 --> 21:20.040
has had to have gotten its political, psychological, and philosophical act together.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.680
And I don't see why, you know.

21:25.440 --> 21:31.220
And I do believe that if and when we run into that kind of really advanced civilization,

21:31.640 --> 21:36.460
that they will, if not be directly, actively helpful,

21:36.600 --> 21:43.040
certainly will be benign and will not be interested in either eating us, or conquering our planet, or blowing us up, or anything like that.

21:44.100 --> 21:49.260
Songs from the Stars is a thoughtfully written book with a theme, but it's also good exciting science fiction.

21:56.660 --> 22:02.060
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:02.300 --> 22:05.180
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.660
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show.

22:52.660 --> 22:55.120
So stay with us.

23:10.620 --> 23:15.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:18.380 --> 23:20.180
And here are your hosts.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.560
This is David Carson.

23:25.780 --> 23:26.420
And Darrell Lane.

23:26.740 --> 23:33.420
James P. Hogan's latest novel, Voyage from Yesteryear, is a fascinating blend of computers, space exploration, and genetic engineering.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.580
It's about a robot probe that discovers a habitable planet ten light years from Earth,

23:37.800 --> 23:40.560
but it's different than the usual probe imagined by science fiction authors.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.800
Right. This one is equipped to manufacture human beings.

23:44.220 --> 23:44.760
Hogan explains.

24:11.640 --> 24:16.380
So why not let the machines fly the ship and make the people when you get there?

24:17.140 --> 24:23.760
If we look at the progress made in molecular biology, genetic engineering, in the last couple of decades,

24:24.500 --> 24:31.420
we already manufactured quite complex organic molecules to specifications, such as drugs and certain anaesthetics.

24:32.200 --> 24:37.040
If we just extrapolate that a little further, who's to say you couldn't make a complete set of human DNA?

24:37.740 --> 24:43.840
In other words, instead of sending bodies and all the support equipment to freeze them and taking up all the space,

24:43.980 --> 24:55.140
why not just store all the genetic information necessary to make people electronically in the computers

24:56.040 --> 25:02.620
and create them when you have found a planet that the instruments say they could survive on?

25:02.620 --> 25:07.200
So the computers make a race of humans, raise them, and place them on the planet.

25:07.580 --> 25:12.160
It sounds a bit mechanical, a little inhuman perhaps, but Hogan thinks it could work out beautifully.

25:13.060 --> 25:24.200
So here's the interesting possibility of a race that evolves from a first generation of embryos

25:24.200 --> 25:30.020
that were created and nurtured and raised by computers and robots, a machine-raised race.

25:30.860 --> 25:36.480
And when you think about it, the relationship between the children and the machines

25:36.480 --> 25:39.420
does not really have to be a cold and sinister one at all.

25:39.780 --> 25:41.540
It could be quite a charming and amusing one.

25:43.160 --> 25:49.160
The interesting thoughts that the book starts to play with is here is a race of kids that are being raised by

25:52.200 --> 25:56.240
some very rational, direct, down-to-earth entities

25:57.260 --> 26:03.520
who don't double talk or deceive or have all these layers of human game-playing that we have to contend with.

26:04.960 --> 26:15.500
And they're being raised completely without any exposure to the conditioning of conditioned adults

26:15.500 --> 26:19.800
with their prejudices and hatreds and taboos.

26:20.720 --> 26:24.800
A lot of the other nonsense is that make life so complicated in our society.

26:25.600 --> 26:30.080
As you might expect, these machine-raised humans are eventually contacted by humans from Earth.

26:31.100 --> 26:34.280
Let's imagine that a mission from Earth eventually shows up.

26:37.320 --> 26:41.360
Virtually, you know, a big mission. This is a 20-year voyage, maybe.

26:42.280 --> 26:46.160
So we're talking about a spaceship that maybe houses 20,000 people,

26:46.520 --> 26:52.540
a space colony with engines, with its government, its military, its church organizations,

26:52.540 --> 26:59.820
its commercial institutions, the whole of society in miniature with its time-proved mechanisms

26:59.820 --> 27:03.140
for controlling and subordinating a population.

27:04.040 --> 27:13.640
Which traditionally, a ruling elite through history has imposed itself by restricting the flow of wealth

27:13.640 --> 27:18.480
and by offering protection either from real or imagined threats.

27:19.720 --> 27:26.640
And so what happens when a race of machine-raised people eventually collides with a race of people-raised people?

27:27.500 --> 27:29.160
And that's really what the story's all about.

27:30.180 --> 27:32.580
Voyage from yesteryear will be out in paperback at the end of July.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.660
Next week we'll have a series of shows on the works of James B. Hogan.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.940
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show.

27:44.940 --> 27:47.860
A production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

27:48.120 --> 27:50.980
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:14.940 --> 28:16.000
Thank you.
