Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.280
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.760
And here are your hosts.

00:44.140 --> 00:45.420
This is Daryl Lane.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.200
And Bill Vernon.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.040
James Gunn approaches science fiction from many angles.

00:49.540 --> 00:54.600
He writes it, he teaches it, and he's published important historical and critical material in science fiction.

00:54.600 --> 01:00.920
Some of Gunn's better known novels include The Joymakers, The Immortals, The Listeners, and The Dreamers.

01:01.380 --> 01:05.480
The Immortals was the basis for the television show of a few years back, The Immortal.

01:06.120 --> 01:15.520
Gunn's critical work, in addition to numerous essays, consists of two major publications, Alternate Worlds, a 1975 history of science fiction, and The Road to Science Fiction,

01:15.720 --> 01:20.860
a four volume anthology that includes Gunn's essays on the definition of science fiction and its historical development.

01:20.860 --> 01:28.980
Gunn's criticism is valuable because it not only comes from someone who knows the field, but also because Gunn is a scholar and professor at a major university.

01:29.380 --> 01:32.340
He brings the insight of a professional academic to the field.

01:32.780 --> 01:36.520
We talked with Gunn about how he divides himself between being both a writer and a teacher.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.820
We asked him if he'd ever considered writing as a full-time career.

01:39.820 --> 02:01.040
I did, as a matter of fact, write full-time for a period of a little more than three years, a year in 1948-49, and I went back to school then and got a master's degree, but I continued to write.

02:03.940 --> 02:18.380
Then, after I'd worked for this paperback publisher, after I got my master's degree, worked for a paperback publisher for a year and a half, I found out that I'd sold four stories that I hadn't known about and decided to go back to full-time writing.

02:18.380 --> 02:48.360
So I did write full-time from the fall of 1942 until the late summer of 1955, and really much of the groundwork for the later books that I published and the success that I had, I think, such as it was, was based upon that freelance paper.

02:48.380 --> 03:09.860
I didn't make a lot of money out of it, you know, below the poverty level, but my needs were fairly simple at that time and what it later paid off in the sense that the stories that I wrote appeared in books and some of them even were made in the movies and all that sort of thing.

03:10.740 --> 03:13.160
Gunn explains how I became involved in teaching.

03:13.160 --> 03:39.140
It was after 1955, or in the fall of 1955, after my wife and I had moved back to Lawrence, Kansas, simply as a place to live, but I got involved almost by accident with teaching at the university from which I'd gotten my two degrees, University of Kansas, and became involved with other aspects of the university.

03:39.140 --> 03:53.880
I edited the alumni magazine for three years and then became director of public relations for the university for 12 years before returning to full-time teaching and writing in 1970.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.120
Gunn had always intended to write science fiction criticism.

03:57.940 --> 04:11.900
But looking back upon it, I know, I think right from the beginning, I had the feeling that I wanted to do criticism in the area.

04:12.840 --> 04:39.140
My first 10 stories, for instance, were published under a pseudonym of Edwin James using, I began to use my own name with the 11th story, but the reason I can remember now for doing that was the fact that I thought I would write criticism about science fiction and I wanted to save my real name for that.

04:39.900 --> 04:47.660
But after 10 stories, I decided that was foolish and I ought to use my real name for everything.

04:48.820 --> 04:57.060
And that looking back upon it, I think the academic interest was there right from the beginning.

04:57.920 --> 05:03.200
Beginning next time, we'll talk with James Gunn about his writing, both the stories and the criticism.

05:10.640 --> 05:19.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:06.420 --> 06:09.120
The next story is about the science fiction radio show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in Odessa, Texas.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.340
So stay with us.

06:26.420 --> 06:31.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.220
And here are your hosts.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.020
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

06:43.280 --> 06:51.120
James Gunn, author, critic and teacher of science fiction, has written some valuable books on the definition and historical development of science fiction.

06:51.500 --> 06:58.940
He's examining some big questions in this work, things like what is science fiction, what makes it different from other literature and where it comes from.

06:58.940 --> 07:09.800
And since Gunn is a professor at the University of Kansas, besides being a long-time author of science fiction, he combines a scholar's objectivity and a creator's understanding in answering these questions.

07:10.500 --> 07:16.000
Alternate Worlds, published in 1976, is his first major critical work. Gunn explains its origin.

07:28.940 --> 07:34.080
I'm a writer at the University of Kansas, and I'm a writer at the University of Kansas, where there is some resistance to the notion of doing that.

07:35.100 --> 07:47.680
And I accepted because I had the feeling that there wasn't a good history of science fiction, and that this course would give me the incentive to write it.

07:48.680 --> 08:04.640
So I sat down and wrote very fast, and ended up with 13 chapters representing about 13 lectures for the 14-week semester.

08:06.560 --> 08:27.000
And these chapters, or these lectures, became the 13 chapters in a book of mine which appeared in about, I guess, 75 after some delays as Alternate Worlds, the illustrated history of science fiction.

08:27.000 --> 08:41.040
But as one consequence of its publication, I got a call one day from an editor at New American Library who was admiring it and asked me if I'd like to do a book for them.

08:41.800 --> 09:05.240
And I knew also that I really felt the need for anthologies which covered more than the brief span of the 20s to the 60s, which most anthologies did, and there really wasn't much in the 20s or 30s, most of it,

09:05.240 --> 09:08.600
but it appeared, covered the period of the 40s to the 50s.

09:09.320 --> 09:17.820
So I said yes, and I sent them a proposal for the first volume of the Road to Science Fiction.

09:17.980 --> 09:33.980
At that time, all we knew that there would be would be one volume which covered the period from the earliest prehistory of literature, not to mention science fiction,

09:33.980 --> 09:42.760
up to 1900, and the H.G. Wells' early stories and novels.

09:44.400 --> 09:57.000
The volume used a unique and valuable approach to science fiction criticism. It was an anthology of stories, but each story was accompanied by an essay which covered the story's importance and also discussed the period of science fiction history to which it belonged.

09:57.420 --> 09:59.720
Gunn explains how that volume led to others.

10:00.320 --> 10:13.820
By the time I got finished with the manuscript, I had felt that it really, unlike most books, came out even better than I thought it was going to, and I proposed that we go ahead with a second and third volume.

10:13.820 --> 10:38.140
They said, let's wait and see how this does, and eventually after it had done better than they thought, they agreed that I could go on to volume two and three, which covered the period from 1900 to approximately 1940,

10:38.900 --> 10:46.720
and then from 1940 to 1970 or 1970, actually, the latest one, 76, I think.

10:47.600 --> 10:57.160
Gunn has recently published a fourth volume in the series and says that it's now finished. The title for the entire series is the Road to Science Fiction, and it stands as a major work of science fiction criticism.

10:57.660 --> 11:00.300
We'll talk some more about it with James Gunn next time.

11:06.980 --> 11:16.360
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

12:01.900 --> 12:06.160
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:22.120 --> 12:27.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:30.460 --> 12:31.920
And here are your hosts.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.240
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

12:38.800 --> 12:45.120
James Gunn is noted not only as an author of science fiction, but as a critic of the field and as a chronicler in the story of its development.

12:45.460 --> 12:57.240
Gunn has recently completed the last volume in his four volume series, The Road to Science Fiction. In this unique work, he traces the development of science fiction from the very beginning of recorded literature until the present day.

12:57.240 --> 13:06.560
What's different and valuable about Gunn's approach in The Road to Science Fiction is that he uses the actual literature itself, from tales belonging to the ancient world and modern short stories.

13:06.860 --> 13:14.200
But each literary selection is accompanied by an essay which discusses the work's importance and deals with the historical period to which it belongs.

13:14.740 --> 13:22.580
When using the volumes then, a reader not only is getting some good science fiction, but he's picking up an education relating to the definition and development of science fiction.

13:22.580 --> 13:28.060
Except for the last one, each volume is also organized around a particular thesis or point.

13:28.640 --> 13:35.320
The first one, for instance, develops the idea that before real science fiction could exist, mankind had to recognize the concept of change.

13:36.180 --> 13:43.080
It seems to me that the essential nature of science fiction is that it deals with change.

13:43.080 --> 13:58.480
In fact, in order for us to recognize a story or a novel as being science fiction, we have to identify that part of it which is different from here and now, our everyday world.

14:00.280 --> 14:07.460
And so it deals with how people would react in changed circumstances.

14:09.500 --> 14:21.680
So, up to approximately the time of the Industrial Revolution, the very concept of change itself was alien to human minds.

14:21.680 --> 14:45.940
It seems to me, looking back over the history of humanity, that mostly people saw change as being only the eternal circle of the seasons changing from spring to summer to fall to winter and back again.

14:45.940 --> 15:03.800
And it wasn't until the Industrial Revolution and, of course, the scientific perceptions that preceded it and accompanied it, which began to create change that people saw could be beneficial.

15:05.380 --> 15:10.200
And in which they could, over which they might be able to exercise some control.

15:10.440 --> 15:23.860
That is, it was man-made change created by human desires and intelligence, and it could be controlled by humanity's exercise of intelligence.

15:23.860 --> 15:32.760
And it seems to me that science fiction was the literary response to that recognition.

15:33.840 --> 15:38.840
The next two volumes develop other ideas that Dunne believes are essential to the development of science fiction.

15:39.360 --> 15:44.380
The notion, for instance, that mankind is a species rather than isolated tribes or nations or races.

15:44.680 --> 15:52.280
But the last volume is a bit different. This is because it deals with the most recent science fiction stories, and it's more difficult to tell which ones will be important.

15:52.280 --> 15:57.300
In the more current story, this is much more difficult to determine.

15:58.260 --> 16:12.440
You can't really say what stories are important until much after they've been published, and you can't certainly say which are typical until you decide what the period really stands for.

16:12.440 --> 16:24.200
So what I did in the fourth volume was to select stories that I thought dealt with the literary uses of science fiction.

16:25.140 --> 16:33.820
And so that volume is primarily concerned not with questions of generic importance, but the question of literary uses.

16:34.620 --> 16:39.820
Dunne has performed a valuable service to the field with the four volumes in his The Road to Science Fiction series.

16:39.820 --> 16:50.420
By defining science fiction, by demonstrating what makes it different from other types of literature, and by revealing its origins, he's made science fiction more understandable and more respectable.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.180
Next time we'll talk with Dunne about his own fiction.

17:00.660 --> 17:09.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:15.720 --> 18:21.040
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.440
And here are your hosts.

18:30.020 --> 18:32.220
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

18:32.500 --> 18:36.860
In much of his science fiction, James Gunn examines the question of what makes man happy.

18:37.520 --> 18:44.080
He extrapolates a future which seems plausible from current social conditions and asks the standard science fiction question, what if?

18:44.080 --> 18:54.200
In his 1963 novel The Joymakers, he fills out the question by asking what if man discovered a drug that would make him perfectly happy, even though it would remove him from the real world.

18:54.900 --> 19:01.440
Gunn answers the question by saying that man would probably accept the opportunity, and then he shows what what happened to man in society as a result.

19:02.520 --> 19:25.220
Ultimately, as it worked out in the novel, it turned out that the people who wanted happiness to get what they want, since what one can get in the external world is limited by the number of people and the number of people who want this particular thing,

19:26.180 --> 19:34.020
ultimately they get what they want by being fed illusions that they get what they want.

19:34.680 --> 19:46.580
And ultimately everybody ends up floating in amniotic cells living on on dreams of success and accomplishment fed by a machine,

19:46.580 --> 19:53.660
which I eventually worked out to be that you're happy when you don't want anything anymore.

19:54.580 --> 20:08.340
And it occurred to me that that is the same as death and ultimately the equation for that is that happiness equals death and that life is still wanting something.

20:09.320 --> 20:19.620
One of Gunn's more recent books, The Dreamers, also published in paperback as The Mind Master, also presents a society in which man has presumably achieved perfect happiness.

20:20.260 --> 20:29.560
And he does so through chemical memory. Any possible experience can be felt by an individual if he is injected with the DNA or RNA of someone who has actually undergone that experience.

20:29.560 --> 20:50.780
It is a comment on the fact that dreaming itself is a non-survival characteristic. It may be the most satisfying experience, but as perhaps I said in The Joymakers,

20:50.780 --> 21:11.760
is perhaps repeated here in a different way, that ultimate satisfaction or dreaming is a death activity and that survival demands something less than total satisfaction.

21:12.640 --> 21:21.580
Both The Joymakers and The Dreamers, along with many of Gunn's other books, consist of a series of related novellas, rather than being a straightforward novel.

21:22.240 --> 21:27.840
Gunn says that he started this practice years ago, not long after he began writing science fiction for a couple of reasons.

21:28.160 --> 21:35.680
It allowed him to be paid twice, since he could publish each novella separately in a magazine before putting it with other novellas to make up a whole novel.

21:36.680 --> 21:49.920
And as a consequence, I have since that time mostly written by novels in the form of publishable fragments or individual stories.

21:49.920 --> 22:07.640
And in a way, I think it's worked rather well because in The Joymakers, I was able to use as a framework, as a subject matter, really an idea rather than a person or a group of people.

22:08.180 --> 22:17.220
And so this novel, which extended over about 200 years, picked up several different people, but basically was about one thing, the science of happiness.

22:17.220 --> 22:26.660
And similarly, the immortals, which also continued for about 200 years, and the listeners, which took a cover to about 150 years.

22:30.040 --> 22:38.180
And all of these seemed to me to focus on an idea, which is what science fiction mostly does.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.520
We'll continue with the work of James Gunn next time.

22:48.940 --> 22:57.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

And here are your hosts.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.380
This is Daryl Lane.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.100
And Bill Vernon.

24:23.680 --> 24:29.360
The Science Fiction of James Gunn is based on strong, clear ideas that are developed in stories with a good deal of action in them.

24:29.620 --> 24:36.200
One of his better-known books, a 1962 novel entitled The Immortals, is based on a classic science fiction premise.

24:36.760 --> 24:41.160
What if immortality were possible? What would it do to society and to human nature?

24:41.160 --> 24:50.200
The novel focuses on Marshall Cartwright, who is immortal, and a search forum by Leroy Weaver, a dying millionaire who wants Cartwright's blood so that he himself can be immortal.

24:50.900 --> 24:53.140
But the novel is more than a chase or a search.

24:54.360 --> 25:07.380
Certainly, the notion of the search for the immortal, the person that I call Cartwright, Marshall Cartwright, was in there to provide a core of interest.

25:07.380 --> 25:29.340
But I was primarily interested in the novel on the impact of the possibility of immortality on society itself, and interested in dealing with those kinds of impulses that people have relating to immortality and longevity.

25:30.340 --> 25:35.040
By examining people's reactions to immortality, Gunn hopes to make a point about human nature.

25:35.040 --> 25:51.840
And in a certain sense, the immortals embodies as well as anything else that I've written, my basic philosophical position in my work that can be traced through almost all of it.

25:51.840 --> 25:57.100
I suspect that there are no real villains in life.

25:58.560 --> 26:09.800
There are only people who want the same things everybody else wants, but who are willing to do to get them things that other people are not willing to do.

26:09.800 --> 26:19.440
And that the best things in life can be wanted too much.

26:19.900 --> 26:26.220
That if anything that is considered good can be an evil.

26:26.520 --> 26:38.220
And I suppose one of the basic concepts with which I began the immortals was the concept that everybody thinks that it would be wonderful to live forever.

26:38.220 --> 26:52.400
But what if you had a man who accidentally could live forever, but who also whose blood could rejuvenate other people, and his life would be made miserable?

26:52.400 --> 27:21.480
And from there, of course, the entire extrapolation about the ways in which society, knowing the possibility of immortality, would force people with force, society, to pour more and more and more money into medicine until the law of diminishing returns.

27:21.480 --> 27:33.140
And that would mean that half of the world would be devoted to medicine and everybody else would be starving in the swamp.

27:34.040 --> 27:49.200
Gun does indeed show the negative effects of immortality. He suggests that his pursuit would cause great social inequality, cause medical costs to rise drastically, and would also create a society so obsessed with seeking to live forever that it would forget to live for now.

27:49.920 --> 27:54.580
In 1969, there was a television series based on the immortals. We asked Gunn what he thought of it.

27:55.400 --> 28:07.840
Well, I thought it was a total disaster, and that's not uncommon, of course, but the resemblances between the novel and the book are very slight.

28:07.840 --> 28:20.980
My book starts with the immortal being a drifter who comes in and sells a pint of blood and then disappears for the rest of the novel until the very end.

28:23.380 --> 28:40.640
And the television series is all about the immortal and his being pursued, and eventually it turns into simply another search for the papers, another fugitive. Somebody is being chased, but it makes no real difference why he's being chased.
