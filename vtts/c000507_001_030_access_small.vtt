Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.620 --> 00:33.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.200
And here are your hosts.

00:42.220 --> 00:44.120
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

00:44.620 --> 00:48.020
In addition to being an author, Terry Carr is one of Science Fiction's premier editors.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.520
We asked him how he got hooked on science fiction back in the late 1940s.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.100
Oh, that's kind of interesting.

00:56.940 --> 01:00.100
Most people don't believe this story, but I actually discovered science fiction when

01:00.100 --> 01:01.600
I was wandering around at Garbage Dump.

01:03.180 --> 01:08.180
There was a garbage dump a few blocks from our house, and I liked it at that time.

01:08.180 --> 01:10.340
I was about ten or eleven or something.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.720
Sometimes friends and I would just go down and look around to see what people were throwing

01:14.720 --> 01:15.020
out.

01:16.020 --> 01:20.600
And one day, among the things we found, people had thrown out were a couple of old cult magazines

01:21.180 --> 01:22.040
from the year before.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.960
Amazing stories, and I think there was one amazing story and one fantastic adventure,

01:28.180 --> 01:29.840
those being companion magazines.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.560
We grabbed those and brought them home, and I loved them.

01:34.620 --> 01:35.420
I got hooked right there.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.580
After publishing a couple early novels and some short stories, Carr began his editing

01:40.580 --> 01:41.460
career at Ace Books.

01:41.940 --> 01:44.300
We asked him if he could tell us exactly what he did for Ace.

01:45.400 --> 01:55.260
Yeah, in 1964, I went to work for Ace Books as an editorial assistant, which actually

01:55.260 --> 01:58.300
meant that I was low-man on the totem pole there.

01:58.420 --> 02:04.940
I was simply somebody who copied the manuscript, went over them to make sure the spelling was

02:04.940 --> 02:06.260
correct and things like that.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.640
There were no typographical errors.

02:08.840 --> 02:17.000
And then proofread the books before they actually got published to make sure once again that

02:17.000 --> 02:19.060
there were no typographical errors in the type setting.

02:19.820 --> 02:25.840
I would write blurbs, cover copy, kind of, you know, the things that are written on the

02:25.840 --> 02:31.820
front and back covers of paperback books to try to get you to be interested enough in

02:31.820 --> 02:32.540
the book to buy it.

02:34.600 --> 02:39.100
And at the same time, I was reading a number of submissions that were coming in.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.340
If I saw something good, I would pass it on to the editor, who was found at Wollinheim.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.800
Carr says he then began to make suggestions for improving and expanding the Ace Line of

02:54.800 --> 02:57.280
Science Fiction books, and he worked his way up in the company.

02:58.380 --> 03:03.560
Ace Books then did start doing a number of things that I had suggested, so that I began

03:03.560 --> 03:05.340
getting this and that promotion.

03:05.820 --> 03:09.440
And I think after about the first three years, I became a senior editor there.

03:12.420 --> 03:17.000
And began a series called the Ace Science Fiction Specials, which was very much a departure

03:17.000 --> 03:22.580
for Ace Books in particular, but for the entire field for that matter, because it was specifically

03:22.580 --> 03:28.980
designed to publish adult science fiction novels, not simply a juvenile adventure, but

03:28.980 --> 03:36.820
serious novels using the science fiction genre as its format, and packaged uniformly so that

03:36.820 --> 03:42.860
people would be able to recognize a new book in the series when it came out, and packaged

03:42.860 --> 03:48.060
in such a way that, you know, it didn't have monsters chasing half-naked women on the covers.

03:48.060 --> 03:55.920
We had very good artwork by a team of artists called Leo and Diane Dillon, who later won

03:55.920 --> 04:00.920
a Hugo Award and won two Caldecott Awards, and God knows what else they were, extremely good artists.

04:02.260 --> 04:06.940
I also began anthologizing very early when I started there.

04:07.660 --> 04:15.080
Don Wollinheim and I were collaborating on an anthology, an annual anthology called World's Best Science Fiction.

04:17.160 --> 04:23.940
And I gradually branched out from that, since I had begun to have my name on anthologies.

04:24.540 --> 04:29.440
I began to do others for Double Day and Flosset Books and so on.

04:30.620 --> 04:36.240
And that was actually how I got my start doing anthologies, was the work that I was doing in Ace Books.

04:37.700 --> 04:42.180
Some of the anthologies Carr does include the annual Universe series of original science fiction,

04:42.180 --> 04:47.940
which he originated in 1971, and the Best Science Fiction of the Year series, which he began in 1972.

04:48.680 --> 04:52.420
We'll talk to Terry Carr next time about what it's like to edit anthologies of science fiction.

04:59.520 --> 05:04.380
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:05.100 --> 05:07.980
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.360
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:17.280 --> 06:22.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:25.220 --> 06:26.680
And here are your hosts.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.120
This is David Carson.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.060
And Daryl Lane.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.400
Each year, Terry Carr edits two of the best known anthologies in science fiction.

06:36.840 --> 06:41.680
One is the Universe series, begun in 1971, which is an anthology of original science fiction.

06:41.680 --> 06:46.200
We ask Carr the difference to an author between selling his story to a monthly science fiction magazine,

06:46.660 --> 06:48.420
or selling it to an anthology like Universe.

06:49.180 --> 06:50.640
There are all sorts of differences.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.660
They're both artistic and monetary differences.

06:57.480 --> 07:05.760
For one thing, if you sell to a magazine, then the money that you get from the magazine is simply the payment for that use of the story.

07:06.500 --> 07:11.920
If you sell it to an original anthology, that's going into a book, and you get an advance payment.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.700
But after that, you get a share of the royalties.

07:15.700 --> 07:19.600
If the book sells well, then there will be additional earnings on the book.

07:20.500 --> 07:27.280
And the individual authors will continue to make money for years thereafter, and indeed they do on Universe, because it does sell pretty well.

07:28.400 --> 07:39.840
So your chances of making money on your story are at least as good, I would say, in the original anthologies as they are in the science fiction magazines.

07:41.060 --> 07:48.640
Aside from that, there's also the fact that a lot of writers simply like to have their work appear in book form,

07:48.680 --> 07:54.400
because they know it's going to be around to be read longer than a magazine will be.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.940
It'll stay in better shape, and it'll be in library or something like that.

08:07.060 --> 08:12.680
The best science fiction of the year, which Carr began in 1972 with Donald Walheim, is a different sort of anthology.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.560
It consists of stories published in science fiction magazines during the year.

08:17.020 --> 08:20.560
Carr reads all the magazines, then selects those stories he considers to be the best.

08:20.560 --> 08:24.980
But he says that there are certain problems that he has to solve when he actually starts putting the stories together.

08:51.580 --> 09:02.320
And if it should ever happen, for instance, that I think the best 15 stories of the year, however many it takes, are all time travel stories, for instance.

09:03.060 --> 09:06.600
I'm not going to publish a whole book, but with time travel stories, that's just silly.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.400
Again, people would get tired of reading so many time travel stories in one book.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.480
So I try to mix up the themes, too.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.460
Carr explains the particular needs an anthology fulfills.

09:18.620 --> 09:27.180
As best I know, anthology fills the need for people who want to read good science fiction short stories, novelettes, novellas, whatever.

09:28.060 --> 09:32.680
People who want to read something other than a novel.

09:33.660 --> 09:42.680
Probably people who want to have something that they can dip into from time to time, rather than sitting down and reading the whole thing straight through as they would a novel.

09:44.140 --> 09:49.640
There's a different psychology between reading novels and short stories, and most people do prefer to read novels.

09:49.800 --> 09:54.840
They always sell better than anthologies or single author short story collections.

09:56.820 --> 09:59.940
But there are people who like the short stories. I do, for instance.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.260
And they're the people who buy these.

10:05.060 --> 10:10.680
On a re-pandemology, the attraction, I think, is that these stories have been doubly screened.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.700
There are stories that were good enough in the first place to sell to the magazine.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.520
And then beyond that, there are the best stories from the magazine.

10:19.940 --> 10:27.960
So the people who pick up an anthology can reasonably expect that that is going to contain more good stories than the average issue of a science fiction magazine.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.940
This isn't always true. There's very bad anthologies and there's very good issues in magazines.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.280
But by and large, that is the case, I think.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.640
Terry Carr also writes fine science fiction. Next time we'll talk to him about some of his own writing.

10:49.340 --> 10:57.880
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:06.280 --> 11:36.260
The first time we've seen a science fiction magazine, we've seen a lot of science fiction.

11:39.120 --> 11:43.300
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:58.940 --> 12:04.200
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.540
And here are your hosts.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.920
This is Daryl Lane.

12:14.160 --> 12:14.840
And David Carson.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.020
Among the science fiction anthologies that Terry Carr has edited over the years are the so-called Specialized Anthologies.

12:20.580 --> 12:23.600
These would be volumes of short stories with a particular theme uniting them.

12:24.020 --> 12:27.180
For example, a book of short stories on robots, or time travel.

12:27.560 --> 12:30.940
Carr has done many special anthologies. We spoke with him about a few of them.

12:30.940 --> 12:36.760
He explains the rationale behind his 1966 anthology, Science Fiction for People Who Hate Science Fiction.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.100
I wanted, first, that the story should be good stories.

13:06.920 --> 13:12.540
And second, that the story should be accessible to people who don't know the specialized language of science fiction.

13:13.160 --> 13:20.140
There are a whole lot of assumptions that are just automatic in science fiction, and nobody bothers to explain them anymore.

13:20.320 --> 13:27.640
So there are a lot of stories that are published these days that really require a certain amount of background in reading science fiction in order to understand them.

13:27.640 --> 13:33.920
I mean, nobody stops to explain what a Star Warp Drive is anymore, because that gets a little bit tiresome after a while.

13:34.020 --> 13:37.880
We all know how a Star Warp Drive works, more or less.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.100
Or at least we think we do.

13:41.280 --> 13:45.920
But to somebody who's never heard of that before, that can be kind of confusing.

13:45.920 --> 14:01.740
Or the intricacies of the morality of robot behavior, or the strange instances of time paradoxes.

14:02.100 --> 14:05.720
Things like that can be very confusing to someone first coming to science fiction.

14:05.720 --> 14:17.700
So the stories that I chose for that book were stories that had very simple dramatic ideas that were very easy to understand to someone who was not used to science fiction right away.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.100
But that were also very good stories.

14:21.060 --> 14:27.540
A more recent anthology is one carted for the Sierra Club, entitled Dreams Edge, Science Fiction Stories About the Planet Earth.

14:27.540 --> 14:33.500
The origin of that was that the Sierra Club themselves decided they wanted to publish science fiction anthology.

14:34.420 --> 14:38.320
And they looked around for someone to do it, and they eventually landed on me.

14:39.180 --> 14:48.160
The main problem I had with that book was that there were too many stories in it that were downbeat and depressing.

14:48.400 --> 14:52.640
If you start writing about the ecology of Earth, which is what the theme of that was.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.060
Well, everything's going wrong these days, as you know.

14:58.820 --> 15:01.620
And nobody really has any answers about what we could do about it.

15:02.600 --> 15:09.620
So even though I think all the stories are very good, there are only a few of them that hold out a whole lot of hope.

15:09.980 --> 15:16.780
Most of them are about the problems and the ironies of messing around with the environment and so on.

15:18.140 --> 15:21.880
In 1978, Carr put together an anthology many people consider his finest.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.080
It's called Classic Science Fiction, the first golden age.

15:25.740 --> 15:31.800
For this one, Carr chose stories from the years 1940 and 1942, a critical time in the development of modern science fiction.

15:32.420 --> 15:36.420
While Carr selected stories, he did something else that makes the volume of particular interest.

15:37.540 --> 15:45.480
But at the same time, I also did a lot of research on the writers, on the editors, publishing companies, the artists, and so forth.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.440
The conditions under which they worked, how much money they were actually able to make.

15:50.480 --> 16:00.000
And I wrote a great deal of introductory material, background material about the writers and what they were doing, how they came to write each individual story.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.720
And I think the anthology itself contains a number of just classic stories.

16:06.180 --> 16:09.600
It's a basic anthology for anybody's science fiction library.

16:10.420 --> 16:13.480
But in addition to that, that background material is fascinating.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.320
It tells a whole lot of things about how things happened and why they happened.

16:18.660 --> 16:24.260
And it also tells a number of pretty amusing stories about things that went on behind the scenes.

16:24.660 --> 16:25.940
I really enjoyed doing the work.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.880
We'll have more with Terry Carr next time.

16:36.120 --> 16:44.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:36.340 --> 17:40.200
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:56.120 --> 18:01.220
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.540
And here are your hosts.

18:09.660 --> 18:10.940
This is David Carson.

18:11.200 --> 18:11.880
And Daryl Lane.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.220
Editor and author Terry Carr has published three science fiction novels.

18:15.640 --> 18:22.500
The first two, Warlord of Core, an invasion from 2500. Go back to the early 1960s and are pot boilers in the pulp tradition.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.160
But his most recent novel is a different thing entirely.

18:25.720 --> 18:28.620
It's a tightly constructed work with symbolic and allegorical depth.

18:28.980 --> 18:33.780
Entitled Cirque, it was published in 1977. Carr tells us where the idea for the book originated.

18:34.460 --> 18:39.340
Cirque is actually the Bay Area in some sense anyway, not literally.

18:39.600 --> 18:44.280
But the fact is that I live in the hills of Oakland in the East Bay.

18:45.320 --> 18:49.080
And there's a drive along the ridge of the hills.

18:50.240 --> 19:01.000
And I was up there one evening just at dusk when the light is such that the bay itself, which you can look down on,

19:01.280 --> 19:08.840
you'll see San Francisco and Marin County across the bay, and San Jose to the south and Berkeley and Oakland in front of you.

19:10.160 --> 19:16.580
And a lot of water in the middle, but at a particular time of the evening, that water simply turned black.

19:18.020 --> 19:24.560
And I was up there looking at that and I thought, my God, you can't even tell at the bay it looks like a gigantic hole in the ground.

19:25.660 --> 19:31.840
And immediately I thought, what would a city be like to build around a gigantic shaft into the earth like that?

19:33.020 --> 19:40.800
What effect might that kind of physical environment have on the psychology of those people who lived in that city?

19:47.880 --> 19:53.140
Carr explores the psychology and destiny of various inhabitants of the city's Cirque during unusual days of occurrences.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.760
On that day some monsters rise out of the abyss the city is built around.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.620
The monsters are huge and ominous, and the reaction of Carr's characters to them forms the basis of the book.

20:02.060 --> 20:06.660
Near the end of the novel, the monsters, after threatening the inhabitants of Cirque, turn into flowers.

20:07.280 --> 20:11.520
This episode, along with many others in the book, suggests a symbolic intent on Carr's part.

20:12.020 --> 20:14.080
We asked him if there was deliberate symbolism in the book.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.840
Oh yes, that is definitely deliberate.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.200
I knew the general outline of the story.

20:21.080 --> 20:28.260
I just didn't know the specifics of who was going to do what at which time and where they were going to be and so on.

20:29.140 --> 20:32.400
The symbolism is built into the whole concept of the story.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.940
And I tried not to make that show too much on the top.

20:37.940 --> 20:44.120
I wanted the surface to be a story that was interesting in and of itself.

20:44.940 --> 20:49.980
Because I don't believe that symbolism itself should ever try to carry a story that warms me to tears.

20:50.840 --> 21:01.420
On the other hand, if you have a good story up front, and beneath that story is symbolism, preferably emotional symbolism, not just intellectual cuteness.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.480
I think that strengthens the story a good deal.

21:15.380 --> 21:18.100
Carr explains why I chose the title Cirque for the novel.

21:19.200 --> 21:25.940
Look, of course, is about a city which is built around a gigantic chasm into the ground.

21:27.780 --> 21:34.640
And so the city is named Cirque, which is French for Circle, and has other connotations too.

21:35.560 --> 21:40.380
It also, for instance, it's the French word for Cirque.

21:42.040 --> 21:46.800
There was kind of a surface, there were a whole lot of strange things going on at once in the book.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.760
And the construction of the book is circular.

21:53.900 --> 22:00.600
It starts at dawn on one day, and it goes ahead to finish at dawn the next day.

22:00.600 --> 22:07.500
And it finishes at the same place in the city where it began with the same characters there.

22:08.460 --> 22:13.840
So in all those ways, Cirque or Circle was the perfect title for the book.

22:15.220 --> 22:18.700
The only thing it really had going against it is that nobody knows how to pronounce it.

22:20.140 --> 22:21.940
We'll have more from Terry Carr next time.

22:28.660 --> 22:34.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:34.900 --> 22:37.800
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:26.700 --> 23:30.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:46.320 --> 23:51.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.940
And here are your hosts.

23:59.840 --> 24:00.700
This is Terry Carr.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.080
And David Carson.

24:05.160 --> 24:09.260
One of his better known creations is the mysterious millipede in the novel Cirque.

24:09.540 --> 24:14.920
The dance of the changer in the three is one of those stories.

24:18.520 --> 24:23.500
I had been reading of all people Roger's Alarm, we've seen him mention him a lot here.

24:25.600 --> 24:32.720
And Roger at that time, this was in the late 60s, was working a lot with mythology in his science fiction.

24:33.520 --> 24:40.840
And I got interested in his work, I loved his work, and I was always interested in mythology itself.

24:42.660 --> 24:55.980
And it occurred to me that mythology tells a whole lot about the fears, the hopes, the beliefs of humanity.

24:56.840 --> 25:04.880
And that indeed, if any alien creature ever came to this planet and wanted to find out something about what makes humanity tick,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.640
they could do far worse than to study some of our myths.

25:08.700 --> 25:13.780
And I suddenly just, there was a little psectic that goes on in your head and I turned that around and said,

25:13.860 --> 25:21.600
well, I like to think and write about aliens, and it's very difficult to write about an alien from the inside,

25:21.600 --> 25:27.140
because I personally believe that aliens are inexplicable to us, but we're never going to understand this fully.

25:28.660 --> 25:37.260
So I thought, possibly a good way of dealing with the portrayal of an alien or an entire alien race would be to do it

25:37.260 --> 25:45.420
circuitously by telling an alien myth. And that is exactly what the dance of the changer in the three years, of course, is an alien myth.

25:45.940 --> 25:50.020
And the myth itself is supposed to tell you a lot about the psychology of the race.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.520
We never do understand the psychology of the aliens in the story.

25:59.120 --> 26:04.980
The human narrator describes certain actions and some of the dialogue of the aliens, but the significance of all of this is never clear.

26:05.460 --> 26:12.400
The climax of the story occurs when the aliens, who are creatures of pure energy, inexplicably destroy almost all the humans on their planet.

26:12.740 --> 26:17.160
And they do it without malice, while they are performing one of the ritual dances that belong to their mythology.

26:17.160 --> 26:22.160
We ask our if there is perhaps some reason for this massacre, something we missed in reading the story.

26:47.160 --> 26:54.960
We could write something that made no sense, whatever. So the myth itself, of course, is kind of a self-canceling myth.

26:55.940 --> 27:05.320
If you actually analyze it, there's a certain circularity to it. It has a dramatic coherence.

27:07.020 --> 27:16.840
But it's not a story that we would ever tell about ourselves that would resonate with the human psyche.

27:18.240 --> 27:28.940
And I wanted to end the story with something totally inexplicable happening, just to underscore and emphasize the fact that these creatures were aliens.

27:29.360 --> 27:36.600
And I wanted it to be something that none of us is going to understand, and that meant inevitably that I had to be sure I didn't understand it either.

27:37.720 --> 27:44.340
One of the points of the story then seems to be that humans could never understand an alien species. We ask Tarif, his interpretation was correct.

27:45.320 --> 27:50.620
Yeah, that was the basic point. I've been trying to make that point in a number of my stories.

27:50.620 --> 27:58.000
This is another one that I wrote earlier called Top Friends, which makes much the same point, but not quite as dramatically as that did.

27:59.340 --> 28:09.000
Carr's premise in the Dance of the Changer in the Three is an interesting one, very different from the common science fiction notions of aliens as either hostile bug-eyed monsters or as creatures we can become close to.

28:15.860 --> 28:25.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
