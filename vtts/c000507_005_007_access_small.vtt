Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.920 --> 00:34.320
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.740
And here are your hosts.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.120
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.100
Joan Slonzooski is a young biochemist who practices as a scientist and writes science

00:52.100 --> 00:52.500
fiction.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.820
She brings into her writing another element from her life.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.420
She is a practicing Quaker.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.560
Slonzooski's first novel bears the title Still Forms on Foxfield.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.040
We asked her to explain the origin of the title.

01:43.300 --> 01:48.560
From the title and packaging of this novel, the prospective reader might assume it is

01:48.560 --> 01:50.100
strictly a soft science book.

01:50.580 --> 01:55.060
On the contrary, the novel has a good deal of hard science woven in with good characterization.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.460
Slonzooski's aliens, the commensals, are well drawn.

01:58.900 --> 02:03.500
They are sentient mobile plants that communicate by emitting and detecting volatile chemicals.

02:03.940 --> 02:07.260
We discovered that Slonzooski came up with these aliens while in the laboratory.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.040
Listen to her describe her thoughts.

02:09.820 --> 02:14.740
In my scientific work, I've studied chemical communication among bacteria.

02:15.700 --> 02:21.800
And it was sort of of interesting to me, supposing you could have an alien intelligence that

02:21.800 --> 02:27.720
would communicate chemically through things like pheromones almost.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.280
How would this work?

02:29.420 --> 02:30.260
Would it be possible?

02:31.020 --> 02:40.120
And I tried to think what kind of creatures these might be and how they might work in

02:40.120 --> 02:45.540
different ways than our usual vertebrates, mammals, humans, and so on.

02:46.200 --> 02:52.380
And so it occurred to me they might have developed from plants, for instance.

02:55.220 --> 02:58.320
They might use something akin to plant hormones.

02:59.560 --> 03:04.680
Before Slonzooski could write still forms on Foxfield, she had to find a way to incorporate

03:04.680 --> 03:07.880
these aliens with the Quakers who were to be the human characters.

03:07.880 --> 03:15.360
And I also was getting much interested into Quakerism.

03:15.740 --> 03:17.960
I guess that is slightly later date.

03:18.660 --> 03:21.960
And the two things finally meshed together.

03:22.140 --> 03:27.820
And that was really the key to the book was when I was able to combine those two ideas.

03:28.520 --> 03:34.020
The idea of the aliens and the Quakers and how they would interact.

03:34.020 --> 03:38.280
And at that point, that's when it became possible to move ahead with the book.

03:39.880 --> 03:43.640
It seems unbelievable at first that science and Quakerism can mix so easily.

03:44.140 --> 03:48.760
Here Slonzooski explains a bit about Quakerism and how for her the combination works.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.440
Religion is basically Christian.

03:52.860 --> 04:01.920
It developed during the Protestant Reformation with one of the Protestant branches.

04:02.820 --> 04:06.760
But at the same time, it has become very universal as it has developed.

04:07.140 --> 04:13.480
And Quakers today see a great affinity with other somewhat universalist religions such as Buddhism,

04:14.400 --> 04:15.220
for example.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.240
And I made that parallel in my book also.

04:19.120 --> 04:26.400
And it is also a religion which scientists often find congenial because of the emphasis

04:26.400 --> 04:28.500
on the experience of the individual.

04:28.960 --> 04:32.820
In science, you test the universe by making experiments.

04:34.000 --> 04:43.360
Quakers test the spiritual universe by medication and an inward seeking of truth.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.980
An almost inward type of experiment.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.420
Join us next time when we continue our talk with author,

04:50.420 --> 04:51.560
John Slonzooski.

04:58.740 --> 05:03.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:03.740 --> 05:07.660
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:59.880 --> 06:03.920
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:20.420 --> 06:25.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.920
And here are your hosts.

06:34.580 --> 06:36.920
This is David Carson and Bill Vernon.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.660
We are continuing our series on science fiction author,

06:39.820 --> 06:40.780
John Slonzooski.

06:41.060 --> 06:45.560
Slonzooski carries the credentials of being a practicing scientist and a devout Quaker.

06:45.560 --> 06:50.640
She is uniquely qualified to comment on the treatments of science and religion in science fiction.

06:51.020 --> 06:54.540
Her view on the presentation of religion in science fiction.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.100
I'm disappointed that it hasn't been treated more.

06:58.960 --> 07:05.780
I think that it has been, where it has been treated, it's often been treated very well.

07:06.220 --> 07:11.460
The hind lines, stranger in a strange land is a very controversial treatment of it, but

07:12.300 --> 07:18.080
in a way it made people think about the issues and that was good.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.940
What disappoints me more is that

07:23.860 --> 07:29.740
often writers seem to create universes in which religion does not exist at all.

07:30.420 --> 07:34.600
You see, I think you don't necessarily have to write a book about religion,

07:35.160 --> 07:41.780
but it seems almost dishonest to write about a world where it doesn't exist because it's such a

07:41.780 --> 07:47.420
prevalent part of life. And often it's prevalent in ways that you simply don't realize.

07:47.940 --> 07:53.760
For example, I'm a scientist, my father is a scientist, and yet when I was little I learned

07:53.760 --> 07:59.700
about Adam and Eve before I learned about evolution simply because it's such a basic

07:59.700 --> 08:07.780
part of the culture. And a lot of us often don't realize how basic it is and how we revert to it

08:07.780 --> 08:16.720
in times of crisis, such as a death in the family, things like that. And in science fiction,

08:17.520 --> 08:25.920
very often people are portrayed in far future with the idea that simply religion has died out

08:25.920 --> 08:32.800
and there is no more need for it anymore. Whereas I find that to be an unrealistic portrayal. It

08:32.800 --> 08:42.800
seems to me that there always will be people who will need religion that itself. It's a basic part

08:42.800 --> 08:51.900
of the human experience and that science is never going to completely replace that for people.

08:53.300 --> 08:58.380
So, Anzuski has read a great deal of science fiction. We asked her what she watches out for when

08:58.380 --> 09:04.600
she reads a book featuring scientists at work. What I have my eye on really is the interaction

09:04.600 --> 09:11.720
between science and people. And that's the one thing that I think is the sign of an outstanding

09:11.720 --> 09:20.760
writer is the one who can really show how science operates in real life, not how we would like it

09:20.760 --> 09:27.740
to operate in a fantasy life. I think the Heinlein is of course the ideal example of that.

09:29.220 --> 09:36.280
In most of the good Heinlein stories, he will take a look at technology and

09:36.860 --> 09:45.800
get show the human perspectives on it and show how ordinary people's lives are affected.

09:47.460 --> 09:52.360
Since Anzuski is a young writer just beginning her career, we asked her what her advice is to

09:52.360 --> 09:59.620
aspiring writers. The most important thing in writing is to be distinctive. And by that I don't

09:59.620 --> 10:08.500
mean outrageous necessarily, but to find whatever you have that is unique in your experience

10:09.520 --> 10:16.320
and at every step of your writing to try to write something that hasn't been written before.

10:16.900 --> 10:23.000
The second thing I would say is you just have to keep submitting what you write because now I was

10:23.000 --> 10:29.800
very fortunate that the first publisher I sent my novel to happen to have an editor who really liked

10:29.800 --> 10:40.040
the idea and was taking with it. That's an unusual thing. Agatha Christie took 11 tries to get her

10:40.040 --> 10:45.720
first book published, you know, and there are all sorts of stories like that. So I would say those

10:45.720 --> 10:56.040
are the two main things. Try to be, to say the ordinary in a distinctive way, to write originally

10:56.640 --> 11:01.120
and whatever you write just keep submitting it to a publication.

11:02.780 --> 11:07.420
John Slonsuski, a young scientist with great promise as a science fiction writer.

11:15.180 --> 11:20.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

11:20.240 --> 11:24.280
