Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.160 --> 00:34.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:37.540 --> 00:39.340
And here are your hosts.

00:43.880 --> 00:50.960
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. Clifford Simak is a veteran science
fiction writer who has been producing short stories and novels continuously

00:50.960 --> 01:00.520
since 1938. Simak won the International Fantasy Award for his City Series, Hugo
Awards for his stories at the Big Front Yard, and The Grotto of the Dancing

01:00.520 --> 01:09.080
Deer, and the novel Way Station. And he was honored by his peers when they
presented him with the Grandmaster Nebula Award. Simak's prolific output is

01:09.080 --> 01:16.780
remarkable when one learns that until his retirement a few years ago, he was a
full-time newspaper man. We asked him how he decided to become a newspaper man.

01:17.440 --> 01:21.200
There was no decision because I think I always knew what I wanted to write.

01:24.360 --> 01:38.060
And I never really thought of writing fiction or writing books or anything of
that sort. It seemed to me that the way to write was to be a newspaper man. My

01:38.060 --> 01:54.480
mother, who was a very well-educated woman, had books in the house all the time,
and I read them. Despite the fact that we were poor, we got a daily paper. And

01:54.480 --> 02:07.700
she used to sit at the table by the light of a kerosene lamp and read it each
evening after all the work was done. And I asked her at one time, I remember, if

02:07.700 --> 02:21.340
a newspaper carried all the news, printed all the news there was. And she, in
the manner of that day, and because people were not as cynical then as they are

02:21.340 --> 02:34.200
now, said, yes, that was true. And I asked her another question that I thought
was important. I said, is all the news true? Is what the newspaper writes true?

02:34.200 --> 02:45.920
And again, with that lack of cynicism and faith that the people of that time
had, she said, yes, it was. And that decided me, decided me to want to be a

02:45.920 --> 02:56.080
newspaper man. So Simak did become a newspaper man, but eventually he found that
the type of writing it required did not completely satisfy him. We asked him why

02:56.080 --> 03:11.600
he chose science fiction when he decided to write fiction. Well, because when I
was a boy, I had read Jules Verne and I think H.G. Wells, although I don't

03:11.600 --> 03:18.820
actually remember any H.G. Wells works, but I must have read them. Edgar Allan
Poe and Haggard.

03:20.980 --> 03:24.100
And I thought what a wonderful thing that was.

03:26.740 --> 03:36.860
I just had an awful interest in the field. I wanted to read it myself, and I
found out when I decided that I wanted to write, when I found out that newspaper

03:36.860 --> 03:52.100
didn't give me everything that I wanted in the writing field, I decided that on
my spare time I write, I naturally seemed to turn to science fiction, because it

03:52.100 --> 04:02.640
was something I was acquainted with. I felt very sure that I could do the job of
it. And I was quite fortunate, of course, because there was no competition at

04:02.640 --> 04:08.700
that time. If you could string in three sentences together and make a paragraph,
somebody would buy the story.

04:20.820 --> 04:29.100
Simak's combination of professions is, on the surface, a strange mixture. After
all, newspaper writing requires a lean, straightforward type of prose, whereas

04:29.100 --> 04:39.640
fiction requires much fuller writing. We asked Simak if he thought the styles
required are significantly different. They are absolutely upwards. But I

04:39.640 --> 04:47.100
compartmentalized my life into two lives.

04:48.280 --> 05:02.320
When I went to work in the morning, I was a newspaper man. And when I came home
and sat down at my desk at night, I was a fiction writer. More on Clifford Simak

05:02.320 --> 05:03.180
in our next show.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.560
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:26.820 --> 06:32.220
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.660
And here are your hosts.

06:41.220 --> 06:50.800
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. Science fiction writer Clifford Simak has
been publishing almost continuously every year since 1938. Right, but Simak's

06:50.800 --> 06:58.840
first stories were published several years earlier. Here he explains how his
writing career got started and how it was temporarily stopped. I started my

06:58.840 --> 07:16.260
newspaper career in 1929, and my first short story appeared in, I think, 1931.
And I wrote, at that time, I wrote several other short stories which were

07:16.260 --> 07:29.520
published. And at about that time, the magazine, all magazines, the science
fiction magazines and all others, ran into hard times because the Great

07:29.520 --> 07:44.040
Depression came along. And so there was no market, practically no market. So I
dropped out and didn't do any more writing, any other fiction writing of any

07:44.040 --> 07:59.320
kind, until I think it was 37 or 38. And I started writing again because the
magazines had come back. John Campbell had been named editor of Astounding. And I

07:59.320 --> 08:17.280
felt fairly sure I could sell my work to John Campbell. So I started writing again.
And I think since 1938 and 1939, I think it's 38, 37 or 38, there was only one

08:17.280 --> 08:28.360
year in which none of my work appeared. There was one year that's blank. And I
can't remember which year that it was, and I have no idea why that occurred.

08:39.920 --> 08:48.720
So Simak became an early mainstay in John W. Campbell's stable of writers at
Astounding Stories. We asked Simak why he thought his work appealed to Campbell.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.480
I'd read a lot of John Campbell's work.

08:57.460 --> 09:05.560
And I knew it. I knew it. John Campbell was favored

09:05.560 --> 09:16.780
what we today call hard science fiction. And I thought that I could write that
kind of science fiction. I did write what amounted to hard science fiction for

09:16.780 --> 09:27.340
some years, and then begin to turn over to the softer science fiction, such most
of which, well, most people write soft science fiction today. Only a few of the

09:27.340 --> 09:32.080
old hands and maybe a few new beginners write the hard science fiction today.

09:39.580 --> 09:48.200
During the first few decades he wrote, Simak produced short stories almost
exclusively. We asked him to tell us why he stuck to the short story form. Short

09:48.200 --> 09:58.460
stories is the trading ground for the novelist. 
You can learn a lot more from writing a short story

09:58.460 --> 10:14.600
than you can writing a novel. It's shorter to write, somewhat easier to write.
You don't have the time invested in a short story to do a novel. If you spend,

10:14.880 --> 10:27.780
as a beginner, probably a six-month-old year writing a novel, and it fails,
well, that's catastrophic. But during that same time, you could write a half a

10:27.780 --> 10:44.260
dozen short stories, and if only one of them sold, well, okay, you have made a
beginning. So it's the path that most people take to becoming writers or long

10:44.260 --> 10:57.160
-going work. And that doesn't apply only to the science fiction field, but to
any literature. More on Clifford Simak on our next show.

11:04.560 --> 11:12.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

11:12.700 --> 11:13.480
Odessa, Texas.

11:54.360 --> 11:58.400
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:14.700 --> 12:20.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.580
And here are your hosts.

12:29.160 --> 12:36.620
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon. Science fiction author Clifford Simak has
written numerous short stories and novels, and he has won several awards in the

12:36.620 --> 12:45.780
field. Perhaps Simak's most famous and enduring work is his City Collection, a
series of eight interconnected stories written in the 1940s. These stories

12:45.780 --> 12:54.880
featured mankind's reaction to a new situation, and man's relationship with an
old friend, the dog, and a new one, the robot. Simak agreed when we call these

12:54.880 --> 13:09.820
stories a leap from his previous efforts. It was a leap. Because I
always regard the City stories as a sort of watershed in my writing. I have been

13:09.820 --> 13:27.860
writing the old type of early type science fiction work up until then. And it
seemed to me that there was something better could be done than was being done.

13:28.940 --> 13:42.860
Strangely enough, at about the same time, a number of other people seemed to
think the same thing. There's no accounting for something like that happening.

13:50.600 --> 14:00.860
We asked Simak what influenced him to write these revolutionary stories. I think
it was my disillusion

14:00.860 --> 14:10.740
brought up by the war that made me write the City series.

14:13.660 --> 14:28.400
It seemed to me that we were going through a horrible period in history, and
that much of human dignity had been sheared away, that it was not the kind of

14:28.400 --> 14:44.700
world that we had lived in up until that time. And I found myself wanting to
retreat from it. So I retreated from it mentally by going into another

14:44.700 --> 15:00.840
dimension, into another world, creating a sort of fantasy where myself and, as
it turned out, others also were able to find some refuge. I think if the City

15:00.840 --> 15:16.480
series were written today, that they probably would not get the attention that
they got back in the early 40s. I wrote them exactly the right kind of story at

15:16.480 --> 15:21.580
exactly the right time, without knowing I was doing it.

15:32.880 --> 15:44.800
John Campbell published the first seven city stories, but he rejected the
eighth. Here Simak tells us of its fate. The first seven were written fairly

15:44.800 --> 16:00.980
well, one after the other. The eighth and final one, John Campbell turned down,
because he said he thought that he'd written it, that he'd published enough of

16:00.980 --> 16:16.520
the City series. And so when he rejected it, I simply threw it up on the shelf,
and figured it was one of my rejects. And then the writer took it down, and I

16:16.520 --> 16:28.300
think I sold it to Amazing Stories. And I don't recall what they called it, but
they put it out with one of their horrible titles.

16:32.380 --> 16:46.980
And then later on, when it came out, it joined the others. The last one was not
published by Campbell. On our next show, we'll talk about a ninth city story.

16:54.360 --> 17:02.520
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

17:02.520 --> 17:03.300
Odessa, Texas.

17:46.460 --> 17:50.480

18:06.600 --> 18:12.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:14.820 --> 18:16.560
And here are your hosts.

18:21.000 --> 18:29.540
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. Science Fiction writer Clifford Simak's
most famous work is his story collection, City. This collection of eight

18:29.540 --> 18:38.540
connected short stories was first published as a body by Gnome in 1952. Years
afterward, Simak was persuaded to write a ninth city story, Epilog. Here he

18:38.540 --> 18:52.880
explains its genesis. Well, John Campbell died. And, of course, all of us, all of
us were stricken by his death, because he was a comparable young man and

18:52.880 --> 18:55.420
appeared to be in good physical condition.

18:58.040 --> 19:08.180
Some of the writers reverenced him. I'm not too
sure I reverenced him, but I felt very kindly to him. It was very badly hit by

19:08.180 --> 19:25.200
his death. And a group of writers got together and said we'd have to put out a
memorial to John Campbell. And the best way to do it would be to put out the

19:25.200 --> 19:41.140
last issue of the old Astoning story. Not Analog, but the old Astoning stories.
And so they asked, well, I suppose there were a dozen or so people who had

19:41.140 --> 19:56.360
written for the old Astounding stories to write a story for the memorial volume. And
Harry Harrison, who was the editor, phoned me and he said, Cliff, if you will

19:56.360 --> 19:59.060
write a story, I wish you'd write another City story.

20:02.140 --> 20:17.080
And I was reluctant to do that. I shied away from it because it had been quite a
number of years since I'd written the City story. And I knew that I was a

20:17.080 --> 20:22.380
changed writer. I was not the same man as I was when I'd written the stories.

20:25.000 --> 20:37.920
I worried a great deal about the propriety of writing another City story because
I figured that the last one, the last of the day, had wound up the story of the

20:37.920 --> 20:49.180
Webster family and that there was no need of going further. But the more I
thought about it, the more I began to see that if I was going to write something

20:49.180 --> 21:05.580
for that memorial volume, it should be a City story. So for the first time since
I'd written them, I took down my copy of the book City and reread it, trying to

21:05.580 --> 21:20.480
catch the flavor and the spirit of the stories. And when I read the stories, I
simply absolutely ached to rewrite them again because there are some awful

21:20.480 --> 21:31.220
crudities in them. But I knew even as I thought about that, that I couldn't do
it because if I rewrote them, they wouldn't be the City series.

21:33.380 --> 21:50.640
So I sat down and did my best to try to recreate the flavor of the other eight
stories. I think I came very close to it, but not as satisfactorily as I might

21:50.640 --> 22:01.660
have wanted to. Ace published the nine stories as a group for the first time in
1981. The robots in City are gentle, respectful entities. We asked Simak why he

22:01.660 --> 22:24.260
made them so. Most of the writers who had written robots before wrote of them as
machines. And I wrote of them as surrogate human beings. I made them people with

22:24.260 --> 22:36.700
some of the biases and practices that the living human would have stripped away
from them. And I tried to make them the kind of people that I would want to live

22:36.700 --> 22:39.820
with. More on Clifford Simak on our next show.

fantasy.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.300
And here are your hosts.

24:12.760 --> 24:20.560
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. Science fiction author Clifford Simak has
been writing for more than 50 years. All his work, especially the well-known

24:20.560 --> 24:30.300
pieces such as City, A Choice of Gods, and Way Station, is characterized by a
warm sentimental flavor that never cloys. Simak's Midwestern roots and values

24:30.300 --> 24:41.700
are evident in his work, and the reader is caught by their charm. We asked Simak
if he purposely worked his philosophy into his works. A man's philosophy is so

24:41.700 --> 24:55.040
much a part of him that he probably doesn't stop and think about it very often.
He doesn't say, well, this is, I'm writing this way because this is the way I

24:55.040 --> 25:05.800
think, or this is the way I feel. When you sit down and write, you're writing
the way you think and you feel unconsciously,

25:08.200 --> 25:11.060
without, without, uh, trying to work at it.

25:19.940 --> 25:29.040
Not all of Simak's characters are model citizens, but none are ever terribly
evil. We ask Simak why evil plays so small a role in his work. I think I've

25:29.040 --> 25:52.700
never been aware of evil. I have been aware of friendship and love and, um, good
fellowship and honesty, truth. I, um, I, um, get very concerned at times about

25:52.700 --> 26:05.680
the condition of the world, not only now, but in times past. And I know that
there is evil. But, uh, but it's, I, I kept it at times, like, not consciously,

26:06.060 --> 26:18.800
but, uh, simply because I didn't want, I guess I didn't want to think about it.
I, um, I concentrated on, as I said before, on the things that seemed important

26:18.800 --> 26:19.240
to me.

26:27.120 --> 26:37.260
Did Simak ever dream, back in his early writing days, that science fiction would
become a fixture in commercial literature? No, not at all. Never for a moment.

26:37.500 --> 26:54.040
We were working in the ghetto. Um, there were very few of us. Uh, science
fiction was read by only a handful. When you met somebody and they found out you

26:54.040 --> 27:06.400
were a science fiction writer, they'd say, how'd you get those crazy ideas? I,
uh, went thinking around, hoping nobody would notice you. Um, you, you were, you

27:06.400 --> 27:20.840
were the bottom of the heap. There's no question about it. You were much more
despicable than maybe the pornographic writers of today. Um, but we kept at it

27:20.840 --> 27:36.160
because we liked it. Because I think, I, I think it, after a few years of it, I
began to feel that probably it would develop and it might have a future. But I

27:36.160 --> 27:51.140
never dreamed that we would be putting out as great, as great and good a
progress as we have. How does Simak want to be remembered as a writer? I don't

27:51.140 --> 28:09.800
know if I will be remembered. But if I am to be remembered as a writer, I'd like
to be remembered as someone who wrote honestly and who is more concerned with

28:09.800 --> 28:13.540
the heart and mind of humanity than with humanity's achievements.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.780
