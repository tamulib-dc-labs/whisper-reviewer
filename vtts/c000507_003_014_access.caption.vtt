Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.700 --> 00:34.040
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.400
And here are your hosts.

00:44.700 --> 00:52.640
This is David Carson. And David Crews. Over the next several programs, we are
going to be talking with and about author and editor Joe Haldeman. Although he

00:52.640 --> 01:00.380
appeared in print for the first time in 1969 with a short story in the science
fiction magazine Galaxy, Haldeman gained tremendous popularity when he came out

01:00.380 --> 01:09.360
with his multi-award winning novel, The Forever War. The novel was serialized in
astounding science fiction, starting in 1972, then released as a book in 1974.

01:09.360 --> 01:17.760
The Forever War is similar to Robert Heinlein's book, Starship Troopers, in that
both have intergalactic war, powered body armor, and highly advanced weapons as

01:17.760 --> 01:25.600
common elements. Differences between the books show up in the way the authors
treat war. Heinlein's conflict was sort of a John Wayne-style battle with the

01:25.600 --> 01:33.140
bad guys, whereas Haldeman's dealt with the emotions and reactions of his
characters to the war they fought. We asked Haldeman if the resemblance was

01:33.140 --> 01:45.300
intentional. Well, there was no intention on my part. In fact, I didn't realize
until I was about 70 or 80 pages into the book that many of the details were

01:45.300 --> 01:54.500
similar to Starship Troopers. Somebody else pointed that out when he read the
manuscript. I wasn't doing an answer to Heinlein's book. I thought Heinlein's

01:54.500 --> 02:08.560
book was admirable in many ways, even though we have diametrically opposed
philosophies. But the, no, it was, if there's any relation to any book, it is to

02:08.560 --> 02:21.140
my own first novel, War Year, because it's an expansion into a science fiction
universe of the notions that I was trying to express in a mainstream novel.

02:39.440 --> 02:48.380
Haldeman has a background in physics and astronomy, and told us about how he
uses his hard science background in his work. Well, I try to use it to make the

02:48.380 --> 03:00.800
worlds that I invent more believable. At least to me, since I do have a
background in science and engineering, I think, well, the writer has to at least

03:00.800 --> 03:10.240
suspend his own disbelief while he's making up these stories. And it's easier
for me to do it if it's on a fairly solid scientific foundation. Even though my

03:10.240 --> 03:21.640
science is rather old-fashioned and probably rather sloppy by a real scientist's
standards, it's still enough to convince me, so it's fulfilled its function.

03:28.960 --> 03:36.240
In the Forever War, the soldiers experience time dilation when they travel to
and from the war zone. That means that due to the tremendous velocity of their

03:36.240 --> 03:43.960
spaceships, dozens of years have passed on Earth, while only a few months have
passed for the soldiers on the spaceships. Haldeman told us how he used hard

03:43.960 --> 03:56.260
science to evoke some of the feeling the soldiers have. It goes deeper than just
description. The time dilation in the Forever War, though it's scientifically

03:56.260 --> 04:08.360
accurate, its main function is metaphorical, and that is to demonstrate how the
soldiers who fight a war become isolated from the culture that they're supposed

04:08.360 --> 04:21.060
to be protecting. It's using a science-fictional device to exaggerate something
that happens to every soldier. I remember when I came back from Vietnam, I was

04:21.060 --> 04:33.480
suddenly plunged into what was an alien culture, even though I'd only been a
soldier for two years. A lot of things had changed. You know, it's not a great

04:33.480 --> 04:37.380
thing to come back. There were no victory parades and that sort of thing.

04:49.940 --> 04:52.760
Join us next time when we continue our interview with Joe Haldeman.

05:00.280 --> 05:08.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:08.120 --> 05:10.960
Odessa, Texas.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.300
And here are your hosts.

06:31.700 --> 06:39.340
This is David Carson. And David Crews. Today we'll be continuing our interview
with author Joe Haldeman. It was mentioned in the previous program that Haldeman

06:39.340 --> 06:47.380
served in Vietnam and uses that experience in some of his stories. For instance,
in one of his stories, he tells of a soldier who is severely hurt by a laser

06:47.380 --> 06:58.440
mine. We asked Haldeman if that was drawn from his own experiences. Well, yeah,
I was wounded pretty severely in Vietnam. I was hospitalized for six months. And

06:58.440 --> 07:09.420
it was a booby trap. I didn't set it off. Somebody else did. But it was a pretty
big one. I had over 200 separate wounds. But managed to come out of it all right

07:09.420 --> 07:22.220
after a few months of physical therapy. So it's, yeah, I draw on that
experience. The one you're talking about is a mind of his own. But I think I've

07:22.220 --> 07:32.200
got other short stories like "The Private War of Private Jacob" that draw on that
memory. We wondered if he was exorcising demons by writing about that

07:32.200 --> 07:47.600
experience. I don't know whether I am or not. I think I'm just using available
material. I don't think the demon is too easily exercised by fiction. We asked

07:47.600 --> 08:00.320
if being in Vietnam had any other effects on his writing. Being in the Army had
an important effect on my writing, aside from war, because I met a whole new

08:00.320 --> 08:14.320
class of people. That is, all of my friends, while I was growing up, tended to
be white, middle-class, upper-middle-class kids. And their successors, white,

08:14.460 --> 08:26.180
middle-class, upper-class scientists, and so forth. And it was just a mundane
revelation to find that people who came from different backgrounds still had an

08:26.180 --> 08:38.640
awful lot in common with me. Most of the guys in my combat outfit were urban
black high school or junior high school dropouts. And I got along quite well.

08:39.820 --> 08:47.800
Haldeman has written two novels and edited one anthology, all dealing with war.
But by no means should you consider him just a writer of war stories. That's

08:47.800 --> 08:55.880
right. He writes about what happens to people who are placed in that type of
violent situation. He seems to be exploring what makes his characters tick more

08:55.880 --> 09:04.120
than the situations surrounding the characters. One of the themes in his work is
man or mankind being changed when facing conflict. We asked Haldeman to respond

09:04.120 --> 09:16.920
to that. I think it's obvious that confronting death on a daily basis changes
people, sometimes radically for the worse. I met people who are totally

09:16.920 --> 09:28.980
dehumanized by war. But speaking racially, I don't think you could make such a
broad statement. What's behind some of the things I'm writing is the hope that

09:28.980 --> 09:41.600
human nature eventually may improve to the point where we won't have wars. We
find other ways to settle our differences. In his novel, All My Sins Remembered,

09:41.760 --> 09:48.940
the main character is red-taped and shuffled into doing something that he is
diametrically opposed to. When he rebels against the situation, he is

09:48.940 --> 10:00.320
terminated. The story is about a bureaucracy that totally takes over a man's
identity, and he doesn't really exist except as a tool for that bureaucracy.

10:00.900 --> 10:12.540
When he becomes an efficient tool, he's scrapped. The main character ends up
being a spy for the government and carrying out covert operations for them. And

10:12.540 --> 10:22.600
he does them more or less against his will. That is to say, through very
advanced techniques of conditioning, he's turned into a thoroughly different

10:22.600 --> 10:35.940
person. He was a Buddhist, a pacifist when he started out. They did not get the
job he signed up for. They twisted him around into being a killing machine. If

10:35.940 --> 10:42.380
all this makes Haldeman sound like a pessimist, well, he's not that either. Join
us next time when we find out more about Joe Haldeman.

11:59.300 --> 12:04.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.860
And here are your hosts.

12:13.620 --> 12:22.360
This is David Carson. And David Crews. Today we continue our interview with
author Joe Haldeman. So far in our conversation with Haldeman, we've discussed

12:22.360 --> 12:30.500
how he used his experiences in Vietnam in his writing, and some of his early
works. Now we're going to look at his writing style in two particular stories. A

12:30.500 --> 12:39.040
short story to Howard Hughes' A Modest Proposal, and a novel, Mindbridge.
Haldeman tells these stories by using narratives by the main characters in the

12:39.040 --> 12:47.800
stories, reports by them and others, portions of books written long after the
time set in the story, and other non-standard writing techniques. We asked him

12:47.800 --> 12:56.580
if he got the ideas for this type of style when he was attending the Iowa
Writers' Conference. Oh, not really. The connection is with John Dos Passos,

12:56.780 --> 13:07.260
actually. I read the USA trilogy some years before I wrote Mindbridge, and
really was impressed by the way it worked, and thought it would work really well

13:07.260 --> 13:19.120
in science fiction. So I tried it out in a rather long short story, to Howard
Hughes' A Modest Proposal. And it looked like it would work, so I went ahead and

13:19.120 --> 13:30.640
applied it to Mindbridge. I did do most of that book while I was studying at
Iowa, and that's why the dedication. The authors at the Iowa Writers' Conference

13:30.640 --> 13:38.340
were, for the most part, not science fiction writers. We asked Haldeman about
their reaction to his being a science fiction author. Well, they were a little

13:38.340 --> 13:47.780
apprehensive about it. See, they didn't know I was a science fiction writer when
I joined the workshop. So I joined on the basis of my first novel, which was not

13:47.780 --> 13:59.940
science fiction. And some of them were outwardly hostile towards science
fiction, such as Stanley Elkin. Others were anywhere between apprehensive and

13:59.940 --> 14:11.500
slightly sympathetic. Stephen Becker, one of them, had actually had a few pieces
in the magazine Fantasy and Science Fiction. In general, though, they thinly

14:11.500 --> 14:24.040
disguised the attitude that this stuff was just commercial fiction, and
therefore beneath contempt. That's an attitude I've never understood. Some of

14:24.040 --> 14:33.360
the world's finest literature is science fiction. We asked Haldeman what he
thought about that type of attitude. But the field is judged by its worst, not

14:33.360 --> 14:46.100
by its best. And people like that think of science fiction, they think in terms
of grade-B movies and lousy television. They've never read much of the best of

14:46.100 --> 14:46.540
the field.

14:52.840 --> 15:00.420
Using science fiction, it's possible to consider various aspects of mankind's
future, and science fiction is the only literary form to speculate about the

15:00.420 --> 15:09.920
future. We asked Haldeman if he thought that mankind might be radically
different in the future. I think it's quite possible, even, say, within the span

15:09.920 --> 15:26.120
of a century. So many of the things that determine human nature are things that
can be mitigated by technology, such as the problem of dying so soon. That is,

15:26.140 --> 15:36.840
it's possible that we'll, in a couple of generations, be able to live a century,
two centuries, maybe a thousand years, maybe as long as we care to. That'll

15:36.840 --> 15:41.700
radically change human nature because it will take the pressure off of
individuals.

15:44.840 --> 15:59.720
There are other less sanguine notions. It's possible that sciences and
communication will grow into a kind of sophisticated mind control where it will

15:59.720 --> 16:09.720
be difficult for the individual to know exactly what is his idea and what has
been induced by his own society. Sort of a sophisticated, lifelong brainwashing

16:09.720 --> 16:20.500
doesn't seem too unlikely. And you can argue that it's that now. Join us next
time when we wrap up our interview with Joe Haldeman and find out how he got

16:20.500 --> 16:21.760
involved with Star Trek.

And here are your hosts.

17:52.120 --> 18:00.860
This is David Carson and David Crews, and today we're going to wrap up our
interview with author Joe Haldeman. Haldeman has been involved in two multi-book

18:00.860 --> 18:09.760
series, one called Attar the Merman, and the other was Star Trek from the TV
series. Although he enjoyed writing the first of his three Attar books, the ones

18:09.760 --> 18:17.600
that followed had nowhere to go to expand the characters. The publisher was
banking on the current popularity of dolphins and whales, but the series never

18:17.600 --> 18:26.560
took hold and Haldeman's third book was never published. The Star Trek novels
were a different sort of challenge, as Haldeman explains. Well, it was just

18:26.560 --> 18:34.920
being in the right place at the right time, in a way. You know, Jim Blish was
doing the series of these things, and I knew they were quite financially

18:34.920 --> 18:48.980
successful. And when Jim died, I was in correspondence with Fred Pohl, who was
his editor there. And I just, you know, apologized for being like a vulture

18:48.980 --> 19:00.540
circling over the corpse, but I asked whether anybody was picking up Jim's work.
And he said, why don't you give me a try? Well, Jim was taking the scripts from

19:00.540 --> 19:09.780
the TV show and just turning them into short stories, whereas they wanted me to
do what Jim would have done if he had lived, which was write original novels

19:09.780 --> 19:18.420
around the Star Trek characters. Writing these novels was more than just sitting
down and coming up with something for Spock, McCoy, and Kirk to do. Haldeman had

19:18.420 --> 19:29.800
to work out some other problems first. That was sort of cute, though. Writing
the first one, I had fun because I'd been in service during most of Star Trek.

19:30.580 --> 19:40.680
And so I had to treat it as a research project. And I went and saw the TV show
every afternoon, and then I read all the books and made charts and things like

19:40.680 --> 19:51.960
that and sat down and wrote the books. That was an odd thing. I had to sign a
two-bub contract. And whereas I found the first one very interesting and fun to

19:51.960 --> 20:02.740
write, the second one was quite difficult to write. And the first one took three
months and the second took nine. One of Haldeman's latest projects is a trilogy,

20:02.740 --> 20:13.940
of which the first book, Worlds, is already out. Haldeman gave us a little
background on that novel. Well, it starts out about a century from now. And it's

20:13.940 --> 20:25.400
essentially the story of a woman who grew up, was born and grew up on a space
colony, a space settlement. And is sent to Earth for a year of postgraduate

20:25.400 --> 20:36.180
work, or finishing, if you want to call it that. Being set up for a political
position as a liaison between this world and Earth. And various strange things

20:36.180 --> 20:52.380
happened to her in the year that she's here. It's sort of a old building from a
kind of a novel. She grows by being sort of bounced around by Earth. And the

20:52.380 --> 21:04.940
second novel, Stars, takes over where the first one ends and takes her into old
age. It seems as if a lot of authors are writing trilogies these days, and we

21:04.940 --> 21:18.340
wondered why Haldeman decided to write one. Well, it seems like an awfully big
thing to put into one book. And it looks as if each one of the trilogy, each

21:18.340 --> 21:29.740
volume of the trilogy, will be longer than any other book I've ever written. By
at least a third in each one. So indeed, it would have been a book nearly a half

21:29.740 --> 21:42.780
million words long. It's rather difficult to sell. And I just, you know,
everybody's doing trilogies like it. I do a trilogy too, as part of it. They're

21:42.780 --> 21:47.900
very successful. The second and third books have a built-in audience.

21:51.020 --> 21:59.680
Also, I wanted to try something big. And that's as good a reason as any. We've
discussed in the previous sections of this interview that Haldeman's main

21:59.680 --> 22:05.520
concern is storytelling. He develops interesting characters and sets them in a
believable scientific background.

22:13.220 --> 22:21.140
