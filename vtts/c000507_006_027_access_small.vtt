00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.180
This is the Ballantine Science Fiction Hour.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:19.980
Man. Earth. The universe. Tomorrow. What's in store?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.700
I try to stick to the accurate predictions just because they seem to be more fun.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.120
What I'm really doing is playing the game, and the game is, let's try to predict a valid future.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.400
Larry Niven shared his predictions with avid science fiction audiences for the past 12 years.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.220
Today Mr. Niven explores the roots and accuracy of these predictions with his fellow author Alan Dean Foster,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.960
who has himself gained prominence with such novels as Ice Rigger and his adaptations of TV's Star Trek Adventures,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.140
both published by Ballantine Books.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.200
Larry Niven has a reputation for taking a so-called hard science approach to his writing.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.480
It is best seen in Ringworld, his major novel available from Ballantine,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.460
which won the coveted Hugo and Nebula awards.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.760
Niven is comfortable with this approach and with its results.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.060
I try to stick to the accurate predictions just because they seem to be more fun.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.860
Do you think that any science fiction writer can be labeled or categorized?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.320
Not if he's any good.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.600
Do you resent it when people try to identify you as a hard science writer as opposed to just a science fiction writer?

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.240
No, I don't resent it at all, but I retain the right to point out that certain stories don't fit the rule.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.460
The spets stories, for instance, can hardly be labeled hard science fiction.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:59.840
I see. Do you consciously, when you sit down to write a story, try to predict the future if that's the right word? Predict?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.080
Naturally.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.320
You do.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.240
They call this the game.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.220
It isn't that any science fiction writer thinks he's going to be famous for being the first to point out,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:17.640
oh, that there is probably a crescent along the pre-done side of Pluto, of condensed atmosphere.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.780
I think this might be the case. It might be true. It might be there.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.300
But what I'm really doing is playing the game.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.400
The game is, let's try to predict a valid future.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.360
Which is more important to you than the possible validity of an imagined development or its importance to the story?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.800
In other words, what I'm trying to get at here is, is it the chance that your prediction, the thing that you're creating, might come true?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.900
The most important thing to you, or is the prediction just being utilized as a plot element in the story?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.580
I multiply the two. I multiply the possibility of its coming true.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.540
Call it the percentage probability of its coming true times the interest.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.120
And if what I get is greater than X, I have a story worth writing. If it's less than X, I don't.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.420
Would you then fudge a little bit on a possible prediction if you thought it would work out well in the story?

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.240
Sure. I'll use a faster-than-light spacecraft any time I'm sure I need it.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.580
Without bothering to explain necessarily whether or not you think faster-than-light spacecraft are possible in this particular situation?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.260
That's right.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.160
Maybe you could explain for our listeners what's called in science fiction the one-gimme rule.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:45.980
The one-gimme rule being that you're allowed as kind of a convention one major scientific development that you don't have to explain in any way, shape, or form.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.560
Do you use this in your own stories or do you really feel...

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.040
No, I don't. But I know where it comes from and I admit it's a good way to think.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.700
It's a good way to plan out a story. It drives from uh H.G. Wells.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.280
Wells would take one-gimme and whether it needed explaining or not, he would take it.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.380
And the rest of the world is England of his time and vivid as hell.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.800
When you are creating a future universe, do you see yourself living in it at this time?

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.940
In other words, do you exist concurrent with your characters?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.040
Certainly. I've been reading science fiction since I was age 12 and I was reading Grimm's fairy tales before that.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.300
And the Oz books. I think I read every Oz book.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.340
I visualized. In college I read Dante's Inferno and I kept working out sequels in my head on the basis of,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.780
this is great for Dante who has an all-powerful guide who knows it all and can call on angels too when he needs to.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.280
But what about you and me, poor damned souls trying to get out?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.760
I finally got together with Jerry Pournelle and we did write a sequel to Dante's Inferno.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.160
What was that called? That was just published, wasn't it?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.100
It's called Inferno and it isn't quite out. It'll be out in April.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.740
I wonder if Dante would enjoy the sequel.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.300
I think he would. This was our aim. I think we found some places he never thought of.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.240
Alan Dean Foster has made the point that today's science fiction is tomorrow's history.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.640
This is especially true when it comes to mechanical inventions such as one recalled by Larry Niven.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:31.960
Waldos, as designed by Heinlein for a story called Waldo, turned out to be very useful for manipulating radioactives.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.380
The idea is you've got a rigid, a pair of rigid gloves and as you move your hand,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.460
different hands behind a wall of leaded glass, let us say, make the same motions.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.260
They may be much larger or much smaller. You may be picking a part of molecule with very tiny hands

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.860
or you may be lifting thousands of tons in hands big enough to crush your whole body.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.920
This may go further. The Waldos have not been used much except in dealing with atomics behind a leaded glass wall

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:10.360
or a lead wall and mirrors. Picture a Waldo set up with a TV screen and it's in your living room.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.960
After you have breakfast, you go to your living room. You slide your hands into these things

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.140
which feel like gloves with a skeleton over the fingers of a metal, let us say.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.820
You've got a wrap around TV screen, 180 degrees and you're working in Florida. You have a job in Florida.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.180
The signals cross country. You do your job in Florida without ever having to drive to work.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.040
Consumption of gas goes down. The Arabs don't have control of us anymore.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:45.120
And if you got fired in Florida, you mess with the newspapers a bit and wind up with a job in Nebraska tomorrow.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:54.240
Science fiction has been called the literature of ideas and certainly these predictions spring from an ideological base.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:02.180
Yet the most important element in successful fiction seems to be the old saw that people are most interested in people.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.220
Do you think that a preoccupation with ideas, with predictions, if you will, has hurt science fiction as literature?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:19.540
No. It sure hasn't hurt me. By the time I've gotten to writing the story, I am looking out through the main characters' eyes

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:25.240
and probably through several characters' eyes. So there's no question that I'm not interested in the characters.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.980
One of the complaints that was always leveled against science fiction when it was getting started as a popular genre in this country

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:42.820
in the 20s and 30s and 40s was that the stories dealt in great depth with the machinery, with the technological aspect

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.400
and kind of ignored the people. Do you think this has changed in recent years?

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:53.240
Oh yeah. And not so much in recent years either. It changed with the founding of the magazine Analog.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:59.740
Hugo Gernsback had an idea of science fiction stories as a teaching technique.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:08.460
And later magazines were pulp. The quality of the writing reflects the fact that they were pulp.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:15.000
You find about the same level of writing on the average in Black Cat magazine as you do in the Hugo Gernsback Amazing.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:21.700
Just because a story can be used as a teaching technique doesn't mean you can't also make it entertaining.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:30.640
And usually we work it the other way. Asimov came out with a collection, Where Do We Go From Here?, he called it.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:38.580
A bunch of stories chosen as teaching techniques and followed by lecture notes and a series of class questions.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.060
But the stories weren't written for that purpose. They were chosen.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:49.820
Well let's go all the way to the other extreme then. Do you think that science fiction in the last decade or two,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.820
and I'm thinking specifically of such developments as the so-called New Wave,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.700
are so concerned with people that they've tended to forget about the technological aspects?

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.540
Yeah. However, the New Wave was a wonderful thing for me.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.040
In what way?

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:12.940
Well, I first started selling stories in 1964, I think.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:23.260
And at that time, every new writer had turned on to the New Wave and was using it as an excuse for bad writing and no research.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.620
So I had a virtual lock on the field.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:33.100
That ended fairly rapidly because, not because there's anything wrong with the tenets of the New Wave per se,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.340
but because it makes such a marvelous excuse for bad writing and no research.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.060
So it got dropped, essentially.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:49.420
In your own work, when you sit down to write a story for the first time, do you begin with creation of characters

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:55.240
or with your future paraphernalia machines or a social system or a scientific premise?

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.320
I'm likely to start anywhere. I could give you a number of examples.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.000
Passerby. A short story dealing with a man who gets himself trapped at the edge of the speed of light

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.680
when his bizarre ramjet spacecraft breaks down.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.800
He's rescued by something that looks like an enormous golden man walking between the stars.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:24.660
He spends several months trying to convince himself that it was not God he met or even a God,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:32.380
but an egotistical, wealthy humanoid who got himself built a spacecraft in his own image.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.320
And then it all gets ruined when he sees something on a sidewalk in a city park on Earth.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.900
But that story started when I saw an insurance advertisement.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.760
An insurance advertisement?

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.560
Yes, on TV.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.640
You got a background voice telling you how a certain brand of insurance will protect you.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.120
But what you're watching on the screen is about a six-year-old kid,

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.960
toddling along a sidewalk in a park, stops to watch a caterpillar.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.260
There are big feet going past him in both directions.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.840
He studies the situation for a while with that solemn look of a six-year-old.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.980
And then he stoops down and picks up the caterpillar and walks across the lawn

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.920
and transfers it to a tree branch.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.780
Okay, that's how one story started.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.320
Another story, "The Fourth Profession".

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.180
I'd been thinking for a while about the worm runner thing.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.200
The idea that you can...

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.460
The worm runner?

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.240
Worm runner.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.580
You train flatworms by running them in mazes.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.540
Then you chop them up and feed them to other flatworms,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.160
and you find that the second group of flatworms learns faster.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:44.700
Right?

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.280
Now, I'm told that this is no longer true.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.120
It turned out to be something like polywaters.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.000
Somebody had made an experimental mistake.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.100
But at the time, it seemed like a great way to learn.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.640
What a pity.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.260
It sounds like you almost rationalized cannibalism there.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.420
Well, I've read a number of good stories that did, of course.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.680
At any rate, it looked good then,

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.280
and it looked like I ought to do stories about it,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.260
and I hadn't come up with any.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.360
And then I got this picture.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.340
Bartender.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.580
Alien and bartender.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.180
Bartender gets drunk.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.320
Alien gives him a number of knowledge pills,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.240
choosing them not very carefully.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.280
The picture I started with was the next morning,

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.300
when the bartender wakes up with the opposite of a hangover,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.940
virtually anchored to the universe.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.400
He's been fed a teleportation pill designed for another species.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.620
He can't teleport because the mechanism isn't there in his brain,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.100
but he does have the power of total location that came with it.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.840
He knows exactly where he is, velocities.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.880
He could probably walk to New York blindfold all the way.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.720
I started that with no idea where the story was going.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.860
I just thought it would be fun.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.880
While science fiction is credited with initiating

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.020
a number of scientific developments which have later come true,

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.920
in several of these cases, the actual science involved in such predictions was minimal.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.060
What about Larry Niven's award-winning novel, Ringworld?

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.800
How did his concept for an artificial world built around its own sun

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.040
grow out of a scientific premise?

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.620
It started for me with the Dyson sphere,

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.540
and I ought to make a distinction here.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.700
A Dyson shell is what Dyson the mathematician invented.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.280
It wasn't all his invention.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.960
It came from Ciel Koski, I think, who suggested that we could get enormous living area,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.540
millions of times as much living area,

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.940
if we would break up the planets of the solar system

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.680
and hollow them out as living space,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.980
terraform that is spread soil and water across the inner surfaces,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.220
spin the things to provide gravity,

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.420
and presently you've got trillions of these little bubble worlds circling the sun,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.140
instead of nine largely useless planets.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.960
OK, Dyson's contribution was, he pointed out

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.900
what one of these things would look like from another star,

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.520
from let us say Earth.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.780
We would see not a solar-type star,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.140
but an infrared source pouring out as much energy as a solar-type star.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.600
We wouldn't need Project Ozma,

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.220
we wouldn't need people actually trying to communicate with us.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.340
All we need to do is find a Dyson shell.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.140
It doesn't matter what the shell is made of, by the way.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.780
It could be bubble worlds, it could be a fluid, it could be a solid,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.900
it could be discontinuous.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.480
Somebody took a logical jump and started talking about Dyson spheres.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.900
Dyson sphere is essentially a ping pong ball,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.520
an enormous ping pong ball, with a star inside it.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.040
93 million miles in radius, let us say.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.620
You spread soil and water across the inside,

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.500
and radiating fins on the outside if you need them,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.840
and certainly you need gravity generators.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.400
Because spinning a Dyson shell, spinning a Dyson sphere doesn't do anything.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.240
It makes a terraformable area around the equator,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.500
and it's not very wide.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.300
I looked at Dyson spheres without really going into it,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.840
and I thought I can design it, I can design better than that.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.560
And I designed the Ringworld.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.400
I did use the technical books,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.120
and in fact I got the wrong formula for centrifugal force,

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.380
and almost used a much higher speed for the spin of the Ringworld than I needed.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.580
But I designed it all,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.640
and in fact the design now in my head includes a couple of things that aren't even in Ringworld.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.140
I've gotten lots of interesting letters from people who read Ringworld

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.980
and did the mathematics, and made slight design changes.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.560
Like you need attitude jets.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.300
It turns out that the Ringworld is unstable in the plane.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.240
It'll slide off balance to the Sun,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.900
and eventually the Sun will be scraping the inside if you don't correct it.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.900
At any rate, you need the attitude jets.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.520
There's something else you need.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.020
You need a way to get the soil in the bottom of the oceans back to the tops of the mountains.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.580
Otherwise all the topsoil will wind up in the bottom of the oceans, eventually.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.380
What do you think, Larry, of the record of prediction in science fiction over the past half century?

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.680
Do you think it's been good?

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.080
Do you think it shows signs of becoming more accurate than it used to be?

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.720
Believe it or not, I haven't checked.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.360
Becoming more accurate than it used to be?

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:56.980
Yeah, I think so, because the people writing today, even the older writers, know more,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.400
and the new writers are expected to know more, so they see to it that they do.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:07.520
Yeah, we get better predictions because we writers know more than we used to.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.560
And you also mentioned the comments that people sent you on Ringworld,

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.660
for example, the mathematics of the Ringworld.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.400
Some of the readers have become frighteningly educated.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.900
So it's a case then of the authors educating the readers,

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.480
and the readers then trying to stay one jump ahead of the authors.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.360
Yeah, this is also referred to as the game.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.920
It's a different game, but all science fiction fans play it, or large numbers of them do.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.100
I only know about the ones who write in.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.220
They find the flaw in the story, and then they write you about it,

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.320
or occasionally they publish it in a fanzine, and it reaches everybody.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.020
So you'd better not make any sloppy predictions, or people are going to come down on you.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.060
That's right, I had a couple of mistakes in the first edition of Ringworld that are still burning my ears.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.960
What about your next book? Could you tell us a little about what it's about,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.840
and if there's anything in the book, any place where you've tried to make some new predictions?

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.420
One thing I'm utterly safe about my predictions.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:15.520
The book is called A World Out of Time, and it goes from 200 years in the future to 3 million years in the future.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.060
So I'm unlikely to be caught in a mistake.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.300
And just another typically little unambitious story for the average evening.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.760
Sure. This one is highly ambitious. It's as ambitious a prediction as I've ever made.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.760
I should say as ambitious a set of predictions.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:39.880
I will tell you that by the time Corbell gets back to the solar system from the galactic core,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.380
the solar system has been screwed around to a great extent.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.840
The sun is too hot, Jupiter is too hot, both are too hot for theory.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:57.700
The Earth is in orbit around Jupiter, Mars looks funny, Mercury looks funny, Uranus is missing.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:02.600
There is something slightly smaller than Uranus, orbiting between Jupiter and Saturn,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.500
and it all looks like they came back to the wrong system.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.640
What happened if it's not asking you to give away the whole story?

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.500
I'm afraid it would be. I would prefer to leave you wondering.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.180
Alright, then if everybody wants to find out why Mars and Venus look funny,

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.120
and what happened to Uranus, they're going to have to read the next book.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.920
Larry Niven created a unique universe in his Tales of Known Space series,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.940
and his fellow author, Alan Dean Foster, follows up on some of the ideas in it.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:39.320
You've asked me, is the history I view now different from a future history I've been writing over the past 12 years?

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:39.680
Right.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.220
Yes, some of my predictions were silly.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:51.080
There is a story that belongs to the Known Space Cycle that has Mercury turning one face always to its sun

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.820
and gives it no atmosphere. Both of these are wrong.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:00.620
A number of assumptions are wrong. I believe somewhere in there is the assumption that if the Earth didn't have a moon,

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.520
or if an Earth-like planet tried to form without a moon, it would have an atmosphere as thick and poisonous as Venus's.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.740
That turns out not to be true.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:18.040
So then sometimes you can't help yourself. You try and do the best you can with your predictions, but I'll tell you how sticky it gets.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.260
There are four stories set on Mars, or partly in Mars, in the Known Space history.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.320
They were written starting before the Mariner 4 circled Mars.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:34.320
And the result is, I've got the history continuing, but the face of Mars keeps changing as I write these stories.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.860
It's damn-dough-ward, isn't it?

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:42.300
Well, I had a choice to make, and that was the least embarrassing one as far as I could tell.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.480
The first Mars has all those crescent dunes that we are so familiar with.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:56.240
The second had craters on it. The third had not only craters, but what I might as well call Mars dust.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.240
Dust so fine that it flows like oil.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:08.020
And if they change Mars again, which they have, they have changed Mars again, and I suppose it's time for me to write another story.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:17.340
Larry Niven. In a moment, his colleagues, Isaac Asimov, Lester Del Rey, Frederik Pohl, and Gordon Dickson.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.080
You're listening to the Ballantine Science Fiction Hour.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.940
Predictions have long been a part of the writings of Lester Del Rey.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:44.440
In 1942, long before the nuclear age, his novel, Nerves, gave us an insight into what could happen if an atomic power plant went out of control.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:54.420
His book, The Eleventh Commandment, reissued recently by Ballantine, deals with an overpopulated earth, again a subject of contemporary concern.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:02.000
Lester Del Rey says he is puzzled by the way people throw the term hard science around without bothering to define it.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:10.040
Hard science fiction is fiction basically that's written around the physical sciences, not the humanistic sciences.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:15.800
There are sciences where things can be written down in exact formulae most of the time.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:23.960
Physics, the theoretical aspects of astronomy, chemistry to some extent, though that isn't used as much as it might be.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:32.200
Biochemistry should be used, but for some reason or other they seem to think that that's soft science and neglected or else they don't know enough about it.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.200
Fundamentally, you might say that hard science usually involves a large degree of playing with physics,

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:50.260
such as trying to refute, oh, the Einstein limit on the speed of light for a spaceship, such as wondering what really does go on in the middle of a neutron star.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:56.980
Invention stories to some extent are hard science fiction, that is when you try to make the invention reasonable.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:11.460
Rendezvous with Rama is a superb example of hard science fiction because the entire theoretical basis behind the immense spaceship coming from outer space is laid out not in great detail,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.560
but with enough hints so that a person who appreciates science can realize what's going on.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:28.000
Joining Lester Del Rey is Isaac Asimov, the author of some 170 books, including his famous Foundation series, which won a Hugo, Science Fiction's equivalent of an Oscar.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:37.580
Mr. Asimov's latest story, Bicentennial Man, appears in Stellar Science Fiction Stories number two, just published by Ballantine in paperback.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:46.520
Let me say something about hard science fiction too. Hard science fiction is not about hard science. Like all fiction, hard science fiction is about people.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:58.120
But hard science is used as a device to get at the people. In other words, we are writing stories about people who are involved with something that makes sense in terms of hard science.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:05.760
Also taking part in this spirited discussion are two other distinguished authors, Frederik Pohl and Gordon Dickson.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:15.020
Mr. Pohl is not only a writer but has been an agent and editor, and has the distinction of having won Hugo Awards as both writer and editor.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:24.420
His most famous novel is The Space Merchants, a satirical treatment of what could happen if advertising agencies gained control of the world.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:30.000
The best of Frederik Pohl, a collection of his short stories, is available from Ballantine.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:36.940
Gordon Dickson is known for his thematic science fiction novels, of which the Dorsai! trilogy is his most famous.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:47.280
His 1965 short story, "Soldier Ask Not", won him a Hugo, and he was awarded a Nebula for his novelette, "Call Him Lord", in 1966.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.080
Ballantine is publishing his fantasy novel, The Dragon and the George, in October.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:58.580
Messers Pohl and Dickson join in the debate on what hard science is and is not.
