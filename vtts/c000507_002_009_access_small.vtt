Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.940
And here are your hosts.

00:42.180 --> 00:44.160
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lank.

00:44.300 --> 00:49.800
Joe Clayton is a science fiction and fantasy writer who has a discovery of Donald A. Walheim, publisher of Dahl Books.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.360
Other recent Walheim discoveries are C.J. Sherry and Tannath Lee.

00:53.740 --> 00:57.680
Clayton has published seven novels in the Diadem series and two in the Duel of Sorcery series.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.540
She has also published several short stories.

00:59.540 --> 01:02.760
Clayton began writing only after she was well into her career.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.780
We ask her why she decided to become a writer and why she chose science fiction.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.540
I've been teaching for a number of years.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.440
And I'm also an artist. I draw a lot.

01:16.020 --> 01:25.080
And I was much more interested in painting and drawing for my first years than I was in writing.

01:25.880 --> 01:35.520
But I gradually came to see that while I have a gift for rendering, I can do quite good individual objects.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.820
I don't have any for design.

01:39.160 --> 01:45.840
And I wasn't willing to take the trouble to work for that field.

01:46.880 --> 01:50.080
So I decided to remain in very much an amateur as a painter.

01:50.080 --> 02:02.060
But having drawn that conclusion and being in a situation where I needed to get out,

02:02.180 --> 02:08.720
I was about ready to bang my head against the walls on one of your examples of teacher burnout.

02:09.460 --> 02:16.660
And so I started writing as a way of breaking away from the job I was in.

02:17.660 --> 02:23.860
And science fiction, well, because I've always loved it, because I thought I could write it.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.720
And it is an awful lot of fun making up walls.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.640
Basically, that's it.

02:31.620 --> 02:35.200
Clayton's first novel, published in 1977, was Diadem from the Stars.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.740
She's published six more novels in the series since then.

02:37.900 --> 02:42.840
The protagonist is Eletus, a strange girl from a backward planet who accidentally acquires the Diadem,

02:42.840 --> 02:47.520
an alien artifact which contains the essences and identities of three remarkable humans.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.440
We asked Clayton if she had the entire series planned before she wrote the first novel.

02:52.060 --> 02:54.860
It's like just about every one of the novels that are right.

02:55.020 --> 03:01.260
I know where I'm starting and I know my characters and I know my world, in this case, the series of worlds.

03:01.900 --> 03:05.400
And I know where I'm going, but how I'm going to get there develops.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.000
I don't think I can write any other way.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.900
I mean, it would be boring if I knew everything before I started.

03:11.540 --> 03:22.720
For example, in Star Hunters, one of the secondary leads in that, the woman who was one of the toy, a plaything,

03:22.880 --> 03:31.860
the wife of one of the other secondary leads in the subplots, was only supposed to be in there for about three pages or so.

03:33.020 --> 03:37.300
But I suddenly got very interested in her, or she got me interested in her.

03:37.300 --> 03:42.600
And then she began to take over and she became a very important part of the book, and this was totally, totally unexpected.

03:43.540 --> 03:48.200
During each installment in the Diadem series, Elidas learns more about her past and her quest.

03:48.780 --> 03:51.180
Here Clayton tells us of her plans for Elidas in the series.

03:51.920 --> 04:01.780
In the beginning I meant to have Elidas reach her, find her mother and her family in, oh, about the same as the number of books.

04:01.860 --> 04:03.380
I think there'd be about nine in all.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.380
I just finished one and turned it in.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.580
I think that's the eighth.

04:08.720 --> 04:14.980
And the next one will probably be the last in that particular series, dealing with Elidas as the main character.

04:18.000 --> 04:29.880
Each book, I hope, shows makes Elidas a little bit more aware of who she is and what she really wants, rather than what she thought she wanted.

04:29.880 --> 04:40.620
And in the end, she's going to end up, I hope, satisfied with where she is working and living in that place for a while anyway.

04:42.100 --> 04:48.080
So I knew I was going to have her to find her mother and her mother's world, how I was going to get there.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.640
It depended on the inspiration and the desperation of the moment.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.480
We'll have more on her next show with Joe Clayton.

05:02.440 --> 05:11.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:26.800 --> 06:32.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:35.340 --> 06:37.020
And here are your hosts.

06:41.580 --> 06:43.020
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.240
Joe Clayton's Diadem series comprises seven novels so far.

06:46.600 --> 06:52.500
These are Diadem from the Stars, Lamarcos, Ursud, Maeve, Star Hunters, The Nowhere Hunt, and Ghost Hunt.

06:52.740 --> 06:57.380
Clayton's settings are well done, the action is exciting, and her characters are deep and believable.

06:57.820 --> 07:02.720
In fact, the series is carried by the protagonist, Elidas, who is on a quest to uncover her heritage.

07:03.220 --> 07:07.420
We were curious how the series got started. Did Clayton conceive of Elidas or the Diadem first?

07:07.420 --> 07:10.960
Well, Elidas was the character first to growl.

07:12.280 --> 07:20.520
Actually, the first image that hit me was that first page of the first book.

07:21.460 --> 07:35.120
I just got this feeling for something suddenly and breaking into the world that she knew.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.020
The crash of the ship was the thief.

07:39.600 --> 07:44.840
He was also one of the first characters that came up with. I could see him in his flight.

07:45.840 --> 07:52.120
Well, I see these things. Once I get to know them, I'm a very visual person.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.640
There's this little movie screen in the front of my head that goes through.

07:56.640 --> 08:01.580
But those are the things that came first of all.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.880
The picture of the thief in flight, I didn't know what he had stolen.

08:07.660 --> 08:11.000
The crashing on the wall, I didn't know what that crash meant.

08:12.840 --> 08:17.240
And slowly building up complications. I like complications.

08:28.020 --> 08:33.460
When Warren reads the Diadem series sequentially, he sees the continuing evolution of Clayton's writing style.

08:33.860 --> 08:37.380
Yes. For instance, the first novel carefully explains the concept of the Diadem.

08:37.660 --> 08:42.740
The alien artifact containing three trapped human spirits. It also covers how Elidas learned to draw power from it.

08:42.920 --> 08:47.680
But in the later novels, the Diadem more or less takes a backseat to other issues. Here Clayton comments.

08:48.800 --> 08:54.860
I also am thinking of the series as my workshop in education and writing.

08:55.620 --> 09:01.300
And the concepts I might have had in the beginning. I'm not going to stick with them.

09:01.920 --> 09:06.200
I'll modify the vastness areas. I learned more about my craft.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.360
More and more, in the last books, I hope the character of the people trapped in the Diadem.

09:17.360 --> 09:28.080
Is coming through. And as they come out, achieve re-embodied, or whatever you want to call it.

09:29.260 --> 09:34.760
They become more and more real to me and more important than the Diadem itself.

09:35.680 --> 09:41.380
Elidas is a very tough, strong character. This happened partly because of Clayton's experience in dealing with teenagers as a teacher.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.580
She consequently had to place Elidas in situations where even her powers would be tested.

09:45.580 --> 09:50.340
I said before that I was in a situation where I was really banging my head against the wall.

09:51.560 --> 09:57.800
I was teaching English, you know, and while this is very important, there were so many things happening to my kids.

09:58.380 --> 10:08.020
I guess I got too involved with them. That I was totally helpless to alleviate things that, you know,

10:08.020 --> 10:12.700
the pressures on them, the wounds that they got from them, the world around them.

10:13.520 --> 10:18.620
That I was just absolutely useless in helping them live through.

10:21.540 --> 10:34.020
I created perhaps a character that was in the end a little bit too powerful, too able to go to a world magic or way out of things.

10:34.020 --> 10:40.320
So I had to create problems for her and help her come to an understanding of the limitations of power.

10:40.760 --> 10:48.820
Which I guess is one of the themes in what I'm writing.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.640
More on our next show with Joe Clayton.

10:58.720 --> 11:03.920
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:04.540 --> 11:07.460
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:21.640 --> 11:51.620
The Science Fiction Radio Show is a production of the Science Fiction Radio Show.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.060
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:14.880 --> 12:20.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:22.940 --> 12:24.660
And here are your hosts.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.880
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lange.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.380
Joe Clayton has written seven Science Fiction novels in the Diadem series.

12:34.780 --> 12:36.300
She has plans for writing two more.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.420
But Clayton has also written two novels so far in the Duel of Sorcery series, which is Fantasy.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.960
These novels are Moon Gather and Moon Scatter.

12:43.140 --> 12:47.000
We asked Clayton why she decided to write Fantasy amidst writing all that science fiction.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.120
Here she tells us about the rather unique source of inspiration.

13:18.460 --> 13:23.460
This cockroach came crawling down the side of the house and it sat there and it looked at me.

13:24.980 --> 13:28.060
Your first reaction with a cockroach is smash it.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.380
But I decided to sit there and look at it.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.560
It's really interesting, the creature.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.720
Actually it's pretty in its way.

13:37.500 --> 13:41.760
Very nice lines, very bright black eyes, little alert.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.980
And it just sat there and we looked at each other for a while.

13:46.180 --> 13:48.940
So I decided to write a story about a cockroach.

13:49.780 --> 13:52.020
And I decided that it's going to be Fantasy.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.940
It just seemed to fit in Fantasy.

13:56.260 --> 14:07.000
So that cockroach ended up, I believe, with about ten pages out of 300 or something like that.

14:07.700 --> 14:08.900
But he was in there.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.480
He was by inspiration.

14:11.660 --> 14:14.680
And I don't know, he just felt like writing Fantasy.

14:16.340 --> 14:18.900
It wasn't any great momentous decision.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.040
It's just the way it turned out.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.280
The Cockroach passage, by the way, is in the first novel in the series, Moon Gather.

14:48.820 --> 14:54.080
Sometimes Fantasy is criticized as being someone easier to write than Science Fiction because there are no rules to break.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.480
Right, Science Fiction takes place in the world of consistent logic.

14:57.740 --> 15:00.460
Whereas in Fantasy one can resort to magic when things appear hopeless.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.420
If clumsily handled, such antics can irritate the reader.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.900
Clayton told us, though, that she believes well-written Fantasy follows rules.

15:07.900 --> 15:17.220
I am one of those who really believes that there are rules to magic.

15:17.540 --> 15:22.700
I don't believe in magic at all, but it's fun to play with.

15:23.560 --> 15:36.140
It's sort of an extension of all the psionics, which is probably present is not a science either.

15:36.140 --> 15:41.420
Might be, but many people are skeptical about that.

15:42.340 --> 15:47.640
But I can't...

15:47.640 --> 15:52.900
It is just the same thing in the sense that writing Science Fiction,

15:53.580 --> 16:02.540
only you write in other terms the same kind of rulekeeping.

16:06.520 --> 16:21.680
The societies, you can play with visual things and possibilities in a different way.

16:22.640 --> 16:27.560
It's not more at least in Science Fiction, if you do it properly, I think.

16:28.300 --> 16:32.420
It just has a different set of assumptions.

16:34.180 --> 16:36.560
And it's fun to play with those assumptions.

16:37.920 --> 16:42.120
So, Fantasy or Science Fiction, Joe Clayton's carefully crafted work is worth reading.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.260
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:52.260 --> 16:55.280
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:55.280 --> 16:58.500
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:49.180 --> 17:51.820
The Science Fiction Radio Show

17:51.820 --> 17:52.240
is a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

17:52.240 --> 17:53.160
So, stay with us.

18:09.180 --> 18:14.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on Science Fiction and Fantasy.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.920
And here are your hosts.

18:23.420 --> 18:25.200
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

18:25.660 --> 18:29.340
Science Fiction is a genre which invites writers to use a wide variety of writing styles.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.980
One writer who recently emerged with a very distinctive style is Anne Maxwell,

18:33.280 --> 18:35.880
whose first novel, Change, was published in 1975.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.660
We asked Maxwell how she decided to become a writer.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.180
My husband was working overnight since he reported in Riverside, California.

18:44.320 --> 18:48.280
I had one, my son at that point was about a year and a half, two years old.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.780
I was pregnant with my daughter.

18:50.680 --> 18:55.380
We had absolutely no money and I had read all Science Fiction I could beg, borrow or steal.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.680
I had cleaned out the library, I had cleaned out the youth bookstores

18:59.680 --> 19:05.020
and it got to the point that there were no more stories of Science Fiction that I wanted to read.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.800
Nobody was writing exactly what I wanted to read.

19:07.940 --> 19:11.300
I decided that I would write it myself and that's what I did.

19:12.600 --> 19:17.560
Maxwell's multi-layered complex style is best seen in her series of four loosely connected novels,

19:17.840 --> 19:22.100
The Singer Enigma, A Dead God Dancing, Name of a Shadow, and Jaws of Minx.

19:22.600 --> 19:27.160
Set in the far future, these novels feature a common known universe governed by a body called the Concord.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.400
The novels don't share common characters though.

19:29.920 --> 19:34.100
We wondered if Maxwell anticipated writing a series when she began the first novel, The Singer Enigma.

19:35.380 --> 19:41.020
I decided that it had been fun to write a book with Earth as a base for a first book.

19:41.860 --> 19:49.780
But I truly wanted the freedom that would come from not having the Earth as we know it now in the book

19:49.780 --> 19:56.520
and therefore I had to invent a system and systems do, you know, people do tend toward hierarchy and governments

19:56.520 --> 20:08.220
and so I thought about those sorts of things for a while until I created a framework within which I could create different cultures

20:08.220 --> 20:16.440
that would yet be comprehensible through the larger framework in this case of Concord.

20:17.860 --> 20:25.260
It was a great deal of fun, a great Englishful play to sit there and try to figure out how people who are radically different

20:25.260 --> 20:35.400
might find ways to get along and that in essence was what the Concord was, the soul and the strength against the undeclared war, that sort of thing.

20:35.940 --> 20:42.620
I at that time did not envision writing a series with continuing characters but I did envision writing more books within that universe.

20:43.900 --> 20:50.840
Maxwell treats male-female relationships in great depth, not only in this series but in her other works, both in science fiction and out.

20:50.840 --> 20:55.800
All our novels feature relationships between men and women of strong character. Here Maxwell comments.

20:56.640 --> 21:10.580
Yes, it always has. I think that two strong people, a man and a woman together, can create possibilities that neither alone would have.

21:11.540 --> 21:18.720
This is not two weak people holding each other up. This is two strong people using relationships as a springboard to other things.

21:19.680 --> 21:30.440
Yes, this is such a deeply held belief on my part that it's sort of like pointing out that there's oxygen in the air to me.

21:30.880 --> 21:36.480
Now I know other people don't feel like that. This is simply one of my beliefs and it is irrevocable.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.880
It should be in all of my books no matter what they are.

21:39.960 --> 21:43.820
This series also features telepathic communications among various characters.

21:43.820 --> 21:52.800
An interesting mechanical point is that the telepathic conversations are punctuated with asterisks rather than with italics or quotation marks, except in the last novel of Jaws of Manx.

21:52.940 --> 21:55.140
We asked Maxwell if this was her publisher's idea.

21:55.840 --> 22:09.120
Oh, I wanted to do that. In fact, I did that up until Signet NIL and then Jaws of Manx came out and it was italicized instead of asterisk, which came as a surprise to me because it was submitted in asterisk.

22:09.720 --> 22:18.900
At that point there was no way to object. It was a style change made by the house. My contract and I agreed that I see all such changes before they occur.

22:19.780 --> 22:25.040
But at that point, I have stuck with it because it is the style of the house and the break is amazing.

22:26.520 --> 22:36.600
But I did leave out in a way losing the ability to italicize for emphasis because it is very... you can't use that for telepathy and emphasis.

22:36.820 --> 22:43.220
At least not very often and not get away with it without confusing the reason. That's why I chose the asterisk in the first place to give me greater freedom.

22:43.940 --> 22:46.000
We'll have more with Anne Maxwell on our next show.

22:52.980 --> 23:02.440
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:16.000 --> 23:45.980
The first episode of the show was made in the first place.

23:50.500 --> 23:54.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:10.540 --> 24:15.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:15.980 --> 24:20.400
And here are your hosts.

24:24.900 --> 24:31.500
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane and Max will begin a new Science Fiction series with the publication of Fire Dancer in 1982.

24:32.220 --> 24:35.200
Dancers Luck and Dancers Illusion have come out since then.

24:35.560 --> 24:39.380
Unlike Maxwell's other Science Fiction series, this one consists of tightly connected novels.

24:39.680 --> 24:45.000
Maxwell's writing philosophy in the Fire Dancer series is quite different from that she used to write the Concord series.

24:45.560 --> 24:51.140
I'm sure you've noticed the break between, say, Joseph Manx and Fire Dancer.

24:51.460 --> 24:58.720
It's the break not only of the universe that it was written in, but of the intent of the books themselves, Fire Dancer.

24:59.440 --> 25:05.620
I sat down intending to write a full-on, very accessible romp and enjoyed it thoroughly.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.740
And from the response from the readers, I can only say they must have too.

25:10.680 --> 25:17.240
Whereas with the earlier books, the Concord books, they are less accessible, far more multilayered,

25:19.780 --> 25:24.780
and certainly did not attract the larger audience with the Fire Dancer series.

25:26.260 --> 25:27.300
They're just different books.

25:28.500 --> 25:34.020
The Fire Dancer series is built around the relationship between Reba, a Senyan dancer, and her Brynn mentor, Kyrton.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.960
Reba is a young dancer who literally commands energy.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.140
When she dances, the energy streams from her as if it were fire.

25:40.340 --> 25:44.720
Kyrton, who is of an alien species, helps Reba learn to control and modulate her powers.

25:45.280 --> 25:50.280
Reba and Kyrton are among the last of their respective races, and they are attempting in the series to locate other survivors.

25:50.700 --> 25:57.000
Since it's not spelled out in the series, we asked Maxwell to tell us how the relationship between the dancers and the Brynn might have evolved.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.320
They are constructs as the construct in that sense.

26:01.480 --> 26:11.040
In other words, we are talking about a universe in which what we would call a human or whatever you want to call it is not new.

26:11.620 --> 26:13.440
It has evolved independently.

26:13.960 --> 26:17.240
It has evolved with self-force evolution.

26:17.580 --> 26:22.320
It has evolved in other people's labs against their will.

26:22.320 --> 26:29.660
This is not a world in which logic, as we understand it, biology is always going to be followed through.

26:30.060 --> 26:36.580
It is simply a universe in which that which could survive and was created, did, and had.

26:37.180 --> 26:48.460
And when you come to the darkness between the cycles, then you get both a flowering and a weeding out in what can survive that darkness.

26:48.460 --> 26:50.380
The darkness is going to change the form.

26:51.200 --> 27:06.460
In this sense, what we are talking about is the potential for a good telepathy that became realized to the point that it was necessary.

27:06.720 --> 27:17.340
It was a necessary channel for the Brynn and for the dancers who lacked the gifts to come upon them rather all at once.

27:17.340 --> 27:25.800
And lack the ability to control them at first, then you become a situation where you are a symbiont.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.560
But not in the normal physical sense.

27:29.060 --> 27:30.120
They can live separately.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.440
You can fuse it separately.

27:31.660 --> 27:32.860
You can interrelate it and it will lose itself.

27:34.380 --> 27:43.660
They, to be, to reach anything approaching their fullest potential, they must be cared.

27:44.780 --> 27:53.740
However, not all Brynn's and not all Vignasi are dancers and the ones who aren't are the basic key to the restaurant.

27:55.140 --> 27:59.240
There are many unanswered questions remaining after three installments with the Fire Dancer series.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.860
We asked Maxwell if she plans to wrap it up soon.

28:01.860 --> 28:08.480
I must say that I would never in one sense totally resolve the dancer thing.

28:08.660 --> 28:16.160
In other words, even if they do achieve some of Riza's goals, that is a beginning as well as an ending.

28:16.840 --> 28:26.040
If you have a whole new planet of dancers plus the residue of slaves and talents from the planet Lou,

28:26.040 --> 28:35.200
you are going to have a world once again that is dynamic, that evokes sympathy of the past rather than just a moment.

28:36.980 --> 28:41.300
And Maxwell has presented science fiction with two very interesting yet quite different series.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.180
She's certainly a relative to watch.

28:50.660 --> 29:00.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:18.340 --> 29:28.720
Thank you for watching.
