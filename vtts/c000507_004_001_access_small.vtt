00:10.860 --> 00:16.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.020
And here are your hosts.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.080
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

00:28.080 --> 00:36.260
George R.R. Martin is one of a group of new writers born in the post-war baby boom who is becoming a powerful force in the field of science fiction.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.300
We asked Martin his definition of science fiction.

00:40.200 --> 00:49.220
Science fiction isn't about science. It's about all about literature. It's about people and moral issues and the way people relate to each other.

00:49.220 --> 00:55.660
And good and bad and love and death and pain and sorrow and all of that stuff.

00:56.220 --> 00:59.260
The only thing that's different about it is it uses a different set of symbols.

01:00.340 --> 01:05.560
It tries to get us out of our here and now world just as traditional fantasy has done for centuries.

01:06.100 --> 01:15.900
But instead of using fantasy type symbols, it uses symbols drawn from what essentially is the new religion of our modern age, science and technology.

01:17.140 --> 01:23.220
The theme that pervades much of Martin's early work is the intrusion of cold hard reality into romance.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.380
Martin comments on this element.

01:27.040 --> 01:32.320
The dreams that I grew up with, that other writers of my generation grew up with,

01:33.000 --> 01:39.020
our wall drop, John Barley, people like that have spoken about it in their own writings.

01:39.640 --> 01:48.780
And then the reality unfolded. Our dreams came true, but they didn't. It wasn't the same dreams. It changed.

01:49.740 --> 01:52.920
And in most cases, it changed for the worse.

01:55.980 --> 02:04.320
I used, there was a story of mine called Patrick Henry Jupiter in a Little Red Brick spaceship that's included in Songs of Stars and Shadows.

02:04.320 --> 02:10.320
Probably not one of my most famous stories or one of my better stories.

02:10.920 --> 02:19.480
But it's one in which this particular question is addressed in a very direct kind of manner because I use a protagonist who feels the same way.

02:20.120 --> 02:29.200
The World Science Fiction Convention, when Apollo 11 landed on the moon, gave them a special award for best moon landing ever,

02:29.200 --> 02:37.220
which I think is completely untrue. In Science Fiction, there are lots of moon landings that are much more exciting than the one that Apollo 11 did.

02:38.060 --> 02:41.700
In fact, that's a whole point that I support the space program.

02:41.940 --> 02:48.120
My dream of, I think, it's a route that mankind should go to.

02:48.640 --> 02:54.240
And in some ways, it's very tragic what's happened to it. And what's happened to it is that NASA really messed it up.

02:54.240 --> 03:00.040
They took the greatest adventure in human history and through a supreme superhuman effort, I managed to make it boring.

03:00.820 --> 03:07.080
That's what's happened to the American space program and that's what I tried to address in that particular story.

03:08.560 --> 03:13.120
But the theme in other contexts runs through a lot of my work, particularly my early work.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.360
The fact that we need dreams to sustain us.

03:18.840 --> 03:25.220
And that the dreams are often, I mean, that's part of, with Morning Comes Missful too, the dreams are better than the reality.

03:25.680 --> 03:32.540
Truth and beauty. Beauty is truth. Truth, beauty, that is all you know and all you need to know, but it's not true.

03:33.060 --> 03:38.060
Some things are beautiful, but not true. And some things are true, but not beautiful.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.720
I grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey.

03:41.960 --> 03:46.140
It was a little industrial city right outside of New York at the time.

03:46.260 --> 03:51.180
It was one of the major oil refining centers in the world. It was true, but it wasn't very beautiful.

03:54.020 --> 04:03.540
And I read books that took place on Mars and the asteroid belt and planets of other stars.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.600
And they were pretty beautiful in their way, but they weren't true.

04:06.600 --> 04:11.740
So things don't work out that conveniently.

04:12.180 --> 04:17.520
And that's the whole reality romance thing that much of my work does concern itself.

04:18.860 --> 04:25.140
In an early Martin story, slideshow, the space effort is maintained through contributions garnered at fundraisers.

04:26.080 --> 04:32.000
But I wanted to express the fact that I did have reservations and humanitarian concerns and all that about that earth.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.560
But I still think the weight of that story is very much towards the space thing.

04:38.120 --> 04:46.540
And how pitiful it has become where they have to go around and give slideshows to rich people and hope to get a little contribution to continue it.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.780
But I do see us going that way.

04:49.860 --> 04:52.200
More on George Martin in our next show.

04:59.240 --> 05:08.800
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:53.640 --> 05:57.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:14.100 --> 06:19.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.180
And here are your hosts.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.140
This is David Cruz.

06:30.380 --> 06:31.000
And Bill Vernon.

06:31.440 --> 06:35.120
Our show today continues the discussion with science fiction author George Martin.

06:35.440 --> 06:43.500
While we were interviewing Martin, he expressed to us his idea that the American space program is in the doldrums because of a poor public relations effort by NASA.

06:43.500 --> 06:53.160
According to Martin, if NASA were to play on people's dreams of exploring the unknown, rather than to harp on the mundane, tangible benefits, the space program would be much better off.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.720
Part of the reason that we're going that way is because the way NASA has sold it, I mean it's totally inappropriate.

07:00.780 --> 07:08.520
They're trying to make people, they have people who are poor, they have people who are suffering through social cutbacks.

07:09.300 --> 07:19.320
They have people who don't have enough to eat, whose children are ill-clothed, who are suffering from poverty and crime and stuff like that.

07:19.620 --> 07:22.400
In other words, we have a hell of a lot of problems in their life.

07:22.900 --> 07:30.200
And they're trying to say, well, we're cutting back social programs, but we don't want to cut back the space program.

07:30.340 --> 07:33.960
And you ought to support this decision because it gave you Teflon frying pans.

07:36.080 --> 07:44.720
Now, if somebody doesn't have any chicken to cook up, the fact that they're frying pan may have Teflon on it is not going to convince them.

07:44.940 --> 07:51.080
And the fact that the space program produced Teflon frying pans is of little interest to them.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.040
Ditto hand calculators.

07:55.800 --> 08:00.760
And all of the other benefits of space program is supposed to have brought us and didn't even brought us.

08:00.760 --> 08:06.540
But these same people have television sets on which they watch sports.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.840
You know, probably we're all very excited about the Super Bowl and the World Series.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.920
Follow Adventure Series and all that.

08:19.060 --> 08:22.140
And there's the potential support for the space program.

08:22.540 --> 08:29.780
Not the practical, dull, accountant's cell where they show them the balance sheets and say, well, here's a little Teflon, you know.

08:29.780 --> 08:35.940
If you want to get public support by a space program, you have to get it by making it exciting, by making it an adventure.

08:38.800 --> 08:43.780
And it is an adventure. It's a colossal adventure. It's enormously exciting.

08:44.140 --> 08:48.580
Why the hell am I addicted to it? Why are all these people here?

08:49.040 --> 08:55.800
Why did our entire generation growing up reading Willie Lay and Vernevon Braun and what was going to happen?

08:55.800 --> 09:01.220
And the dinosaur projects and the flying wing and the space stations we were going to have.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.940
Marvelous, heady, wonderful stuff.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.020
And instead they're selling us Teflon.

09:08.580 --> 09:11.240
I mean, it's just nonsense.

09:11.900 --> 09:15.160
It's the excitement of it that they should sell us.

09:15.460 --> 09:20.260
The strange things that might be discovered, the adventures that are there to be had, the dream of it.

09:20.260 --> 09:24.400
That's the real powering thing.

09:24.640 --> 09:30.460
Not that they're going to be able to make better ball bearings in space because of weightlessness, but the dream of it.

09:30.540 --> 09:31.400
That's why they should push.

09:40.280 --> 09:48.720
Music plays a major role in many of Martin's works from stories such as the lonely songs of Larin Dore and For a Single Yesterday

09:48.720 --> 09:54.540
to the titles of two of his collections, A Song for Laya and Songs of Stars and Shadows.

09:55.060 --> 09:59.460
A popular song, Brandy, even influenced the plot of the short story Fast Friends.

10:00.020 --> 10:02.080
We asked Martin if he himself was a musician.

10:03.460 --> 10:07.100
Well, none whatsoever. No background whatsoever.

10:08.360 --> 10:12.700
I like songs, music.

10:15.060 --> 10:17.820
But I really have no aptitude for it.

10:19.480 --> 10:27.100
I used to live with, when I was living in Chicago, I had a number of musician roommates for a while.

10:27.740 --> 10:35.560
They would bring in other musician friends of theirs who would, invariably, because the whole group were musically inclined in one way or another,

10:35.660 --> 10:37.620
would say to me, what instrument do you play?

10:37.620 --> 10:39.080
And I would say I played a typewriter.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.400
That's about the closest I've gotten.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.880
More on George Martin in our next show.

10:52.760 --> 10:53.880
Music plays

10:53.880 --> 10:59.060
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

10:59.380 --> 11:02.440
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:02.440 --> 11:19.020

11:47.080 --> 11:48.560
Music plays

11:48.560 --> 11:54.100

12:05.700 --> 12:10.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:12.980 --> 12:14.100
Music plays

12:14.100 --> 12:15.460
And here are your hosts.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.920
Music plays

12:19.920 --> 12:22.240
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.960
Science Fiction writer George Martin is the subject of our show today.

12:26.460 --> 12:30.520
Martin spent almost a decade writing short stories before he published his first novel.

12:30.980 --> 12:34.180
Here he comments on the importance of the short story to the beginning writer.

12:34.180 --> 12:37.300
I think that's just the way you break into the field.

12:37.640 --> 12:42.260
And that's one of the strengths of science fiction, is that it's one of the few branches of literature

12:42.260 --> 12:50.480
that still has a viable short story market where young writers and beginning writers can learn to ropes,

12:50.640 --> 12:52.120
can get their initial publication.

12:53.660 --> 12:57.720
Novels, on the other hand, are not the best way to begin, as Martin tells us.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.440
Novels are large.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.860
Novels are formidable pieces of work.

13:03.860 --> 13:09.220
You just don't knock them off in a week or so, and you really have to know what you're doing.

13:12.340 --> 13:17.020
I wrote a lot of short stories in my early years.

13:17.180 --> 13:19.560
Some of them are good, I like to think.

13:19.800 --> 13:24.400
Some of them are maybe even excellent, and some of them are terrible.

13:29.420 --> 13:35.380
And I learned a lot through the process of doing that, and also through the process of selling them.

13:36.520 --> 13:41.320
If I had been writing novels, I mean, it would be very easy to wash out writing novels.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.480
You spend a year and a half writing a book and then no one wants to buy it.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.920
It's terrible, or it falls apart at the end, part of it's good, part of it's bad.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.520
That's a bad way to begin, I think.

13:50.520 --> 13:56.600
I've always felt that it's much better, especially in a field like science fiction,

13:56.720 --> 13:59.300
where you can publish your short stories for any kind of young writer,

13:59.420 --> 14:06.820
to begin with short stories, to learn his craft there, also to establish a name for himself by selling to the markets.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.800
It's a much sounder commercial strategy.

14:09.900 --> 14:15.980
Martin believes that if one does not establish himself as a short story writer first, it's more difficult to break into print.

14:15.980 --> 14:26.220
You see in the modern, present commercial marketplace of literature, you see a whole lot of books coming out first novels.

14:26.580 --> 14:30.560
There's nothing that's more deadly than a first novel.

14:32.140 --> 14:38.360
That was not always the case in science fiction.

14:38.960 --> 14:43.260
Once upon a time, there was a large enough audience that bought every science fiction book that came out

14:43.260 --> 14:47.240
that a writer publishing his first novel could be sure to certain minimum thing.

14:47.580 --> 14:50.580
Science fiction's gotten too big for that now. That's no longer the case.

14:51.660 --> 14:58.240
So, a lot of people, Joe Blow writes his first novel, sells it because it's pretty good to get to poetry,

14:58.500 --> 15:03.300
just dies of dismal, dreary death, because no one's ever heard of him.

15:04.360 --> 15:09.140
So unless he has some gimmick, unless there's some reason, nobody reads his novel, nobody gives him a chance.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.900
The way I did it in hindsight is much the better way.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.840
I built up a reputation over five or six years from my short stories.

15:17.100 --> 15:22.740
And when I finally did write Dying of the Light, my first novel, it was not by Joe Blow.

15:22.980 --> 15:33.760
It was the first novel by George R.R. Martin that trumpets drumroll and the world was much more receptive to it than had I thrown it out beforehand.

15:33.760 --> 15:39.840
So I think any writer wanting to break into science fiction should begin with short stories

15:39.840 --> 15:44.660
and should make a reputation with those and then make the transition to novels.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.180
At the end of each story in Martin's collections is a date and a location.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.120
We asked Martin why Ian's stories in this manner.

15:54.180 --> 15:58.860
Instead of writing the end, you put where you were and what time story was written,

15:58.860 --> 16:06.200
and it helps put them in a chronological perspective for readers who are interested in kind of observing the writer's growth

16:06.200 --> 16:13.280
because the order that they're published in is often not at all an appropriate indication of the order that they were written in,

16:13.580 --> 16:18.180
publishing schedules being what they are. Some stories are rushed into print, some are held for years,

16:18.800 --> 16:24.260
some stories you can't sell for years, and you finally find a place for them and they come out five years after you wrote them.

16:27.140 --> 16:35.260
So to really get an idea of kind of evolution and changes a writer goes through those sorts of dates are important.

16:35.860 --> 16:39.300
In our next show we'll discuss Martin's novel, Dying of the Light.

16:46.480 --> 16:52.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:52.920 --> 16:55.920
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:40.760 --> 17:45.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:01.320 --> 18:06.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.340
And here are your hosts.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.780
This is David Cruz and Bill Vernon.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.920
In today's show we continue our discussion with Science Fiction writer George Martin.

18:23.760 --> 18:29.120
Martin's first novel was the enthusiastically received, critically acclaimed, Dying of the Light.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.040
The story behind the title of this novel is interesting.

18:32.780 --> 18:38.740
I wrote the book as after the festival, which was my title for it.

18:40.860 --> 18:42.940
I sold the book to Pocket Books.

18:44.940 --> 18:50.020
At the same time I sold a version to Analog for serialization in Analog Magazine,

18:51.160 --> 18:56.620
and they wanted it cut considerably, so I cut it for them by 30,000 words,

18:57.840 --> 19:00.540
which is a pretty substantial cut.

19:02.200 --> 19:07.920
And when I did that, I said, well, I want this serial version published under a different title,

19:08.220 --> 19:11.520
because I don't want people reading a serial and thinking they've read the book.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.840
Not when there are 30,000 words difference.

19:15.180 --> 19:16.900
The book is a lot better than the serial.

19:19.020 --> 19:23.480
So I told the editor of Analog to call the serial version Mach Man,

19:24.980 --> 19:28.420
because my book was going to be called After the Festival, which I had written it under.

19:28.420 --> 19:34.300
He didn't like the title Mach Man, but he kind of agreed under protest.

19:36.220 --> 19:42.260
Then my book publisher calls back and says that the higher-up Peter Mayer,

19:42.300 --> 19:45.820
who was running the company at the time, big publishing hot shot,

19:46.220 --> 19:49.420
not a science fiction editor, but the head of the whole Pocket Books empire,

19:49.500 --> 19:56.200
then he didn't like After the Festival as a title, because it wasn't science fiction old enough.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.120
They were willing to make it after the Star Festival,

20:01.120 --> 20:06.740
but that gave me goosebumps and made me want to decapitate someone.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.080
So I said, no, no.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.260
But they threw out After the Festival.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.180
So I had to come up with a new title.

20:12.460 --> 20:21.320
I came up with about 12 of them, most of which were pretty limp, and I sent in a list of these 12 kind of dreadig

20:21.320 --> 20:24.620
which one they would pick, because I didn't like any of them.

20:25.440 --> 20:29.800
And then, like two days after I sent in a list, I thought of Dying in a Light,

20:30.100 --> 20:31.600
and I liked that title a great deal.

20:32.380 --> 20:36.480
I liked it almost as much as After the Festival.

20:36.660 --> 20:37.340
It's real close.

20:37.740 --> 20:40.800
Right now I wouldn't know which title I liked best.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.180
They're both very appropriate for the book.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.840
And the publisher liked Dying in a Light,

20:46.980 --> 20:50.700
and I sent it in two days after the list of 12 bad suggestions.

20:51.180 --> 20:53.580
And the publisher said, oh, Dying in a Light, that's fine.

20:53.960 --> 20:54.560
We'll call it that.

20:55.020 --> 20:58.080
At that point, I called up the editor of Analog and said,

20:59.280 --> 21:05.240
well, I still want a different title, but After the Festival is now free because publisher changed it.

21:05.560 --> 21:09.160
So call the serial version after the festival.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.940
So my original title was used on the serial version,

21:12.140 --> 21:17.020
and the Dying in a Light title from Thomas was used on the book, the fuller version.

21:18.140 --> 21:21.140
One of the themes Martin explores in Dying in a Light

21:21.140 --> 21:25.260
is that of the misunderstanding that can develop between people from different cultures.

21:26.480 --> 21:33.800
There's a very significant point of the whole book is the role of names,

21:34.500 --> 21:36.140
which I call it in the book.

21:36.400 --> 21:40.220
The importance of names, really the importance of language and linguistics,

21:41.080 --> 21:44.640
to what we are able to think, to what we are able to conceive.

21:44.640 --> 21:50.620
The hero of Dying in a Light, the protagonist, gets in trouble throughout the book

21:50.620 --> 21:53.160
because he insists on making false translations.

21:54.020 --> 21:58.980
He'll see something and he'll say, well, these people are slaves, but they're not slaves.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.920
There's a word for it in the book, an alien word, and it's different.

22:04.160 --> 22:08.120
There are important differences from slavery, but he sees it only in his own terms.

22:08.120 --> 22:13.800
He sees people and he has to define them as friends, let us say.

22:14.060 --> 22:17.240
When the word is tain, it means something very different,

22:17.600 --> 22:19.880
similar in some ways, different in other ways.

22:20.440 --> 22:25.700
And to really understand another culture, you have to be able to think in their language,

22:25.820 --> 22:30.180
in their terms, and not make false translations to your own terms

22:30.180 --> 22:35.040
that simplify and distort simply by the act of translating.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.900
More on George Martin in our next show.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:49.200 --> 22:51.820
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:51.820 --> 22:55.120
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:36.440 --> 23:41.040
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:56.800 --> 24:02.180
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:05.140 --> 24:06.620
And here are your hosts.

24:11.340 --> 24:13.620
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

24:13.980 --> 24:17.760
1980 was a successful year for Science Fiction author George Martin.

24:18.260 --> 24:21.940
Martin received the Hugo Award for his short story, The Way of Cross and Dragon,

24:22.360 --> 24:25.680
and both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for his novelette, Sand Kings.

24:26.220 --> 24:30.040
Sand Kings is one of those timeless stories that is destined to be a classic.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.260
In 1981, the novel Windhaven was published.

24:33.260 --> 24:36.480
It was written by Martin in conjunction with Lisa Tuttle.

25:25.800 --> 25:30.300
We learned that Windhaven as a novel is not the original intent of Martin then Tuttle.

25:30.580 --> 25:32.500
Rather, it started out as a shorter story.

25:33.120 --> 25:33.240
In the early 1980s, the novel was a short story about the windhaven.

25:33.240 --> 25:37.060
Actually, it began as a much shorter story, a thing called My Brother's Wings,

25:37.320 --> 25:38.860
that we completed in collaboration.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.660
Should have done both of them, and I don't know the exact size of that story.

25:43.180 --> 25:45.080
It seems to be much more longer, and he was right.

25:45.420 --> 25:48.540
We went back and expanded it and produced the storms of Windhaven.

25:48.980 --> 25:52.600
But I think by the time we finished that, it was pretty clear to us that

25:52.600 --> 25:56.320
there needed to be more.

25:57.900 --> 26:00.040
By the time we did one one, years later,

26:00.040 --> 26:04.200
and the last years were wrapped in between the writing of the first and second parts,

26:04.920 --> 26:06.340
there was exactly what we were doing.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.720
We had structure of the entire book and the role that one man played,

26:09.900 --> 26:14.520
both in relation to storms that came before, and in relation to the fall that came after.

26:15.200 --> 26:19.460
So by then, one man was written, both as an individual and today as part of the book.

26:20.520 --> 26:25.320
Much of the novel's action is centered on the characters flying about on wings mounted on,

26:25.540 --> 26:26.700
empowered by their arms.

26:26.700 --> 26:31.940
We asked Martin about the research he did to ensure that the mechanical aspects of flying are practical.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.960
Well, I did some research on hang-winding.

26:35.680 --> 26:43.180
I got some books on it and read, so I'd be able to give the story a diverse amount of time.

26:43.460 --> 26:46.620
It must have done fairly well in terms of that research.

26:46.860 --> 26:50.840
Hang-winding magazine, too, realized the whos of Windhaven had picked them out.

26:51.640 --> 26:55.640
Obviously, they had not done it, it had been too full of egregious areas.

26:58.500 --> 27:04.880
In fact, I noticed I picked up years after the original story came out in Hang-winding magazine.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.560
I picked up another issue of Hang-winding magazine, I understand.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.840
I discovered that all these people were selling Windhaven altimeters,

27:13.140 --> 27:19.780
and the Windhaven brand, or Gallo sales, and they're not like a brand name, or something like that.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.980
So I impressed someone out there.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.920
Martin explained the plans he and Tuttle have for Windhaven.

27:26.480 --> 27:36.500
My conception of it is as a real trilogy, that is to say, neither one big book nor a series of unrelated books.

27:36.740 --> 27:42.440
But essentially, we began two stories, and we began with the story of Malice and Wester Amblin.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.800
The end of it, the end of Windhaven.

27:45.600 --> 27:50.520
And we also began a story about the social changes initiated by Malice,

27:50.680 --> 27:56.960
and that social changes, ripping through the culture, that and all sorts of things.

27:58.440 --> 28:03.020
That story is not concluded. That story requires more violence.

28:04.380 --> 28:11.540
But hopefully, there's only, there will only be the two of them that we had originally conceived of.

28:12.540 --> 28:19.300
If that is, if we look around ten years from now, and we find that I'm working on the ninth Windhaven,

28:19.440 --> 28:21.600
both at least I even know that I have sold out.

28:23.060 --> 28:25.940
And hopefully that, that, that will not happen.

28:33.180 --> 28:38.760
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:39.020 --> 28:41.980
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.120
Thank you.
