WEBVTT

00:01.480 --> 00:02.500
Okay, we're rolling.

00:03.280 --> 00:07.340
First of all, I just wondered if you might tell us a little bit about how you, the origin

00:07.340 --> 00:08.840
of the column in Locust that you write.

00:10.140 --> 00:19.260
Well, about two, two and a half years ago, I was invited to address a group of authors,

00:19.680 --> 00:28.320
the American Society of Journalists and Authors, and I chose to talk to them about certain

00:28.320 --> 00:33.800
contractual causes that I thought might be pitfalls for most professional authors.

00:35.520 --> 00:42.140
In the questioning that followed, I found an appalling ignorance on the part of authors

00:43.380 --> 00:51.560
on the subject of contracts, and many of these people are highly respected professional journalists

00:51.560 --> 00:57.580
and book authors, and yet it was clear to me that they didn't know anything, or very

00:57.580 --> 01:05.060
much I should say, about how to read a contract, how to negotiate one, and how to alter a cause

01:05.060 --> 01:06.280
to their own benefit.

01:06.920 --> 01:13.180
And so I decided to write a column for the many other writers who probably are in the

01:13.180 --> 01:18.580
same position, and I asked Charles Brown, the editor of Locust, a publisher of Locust,

01:18.720 --> 01:25.520
I guess, whether he'd be interested in publishing it, and he was quite agreeable.

01:25.520 --> 01:35.280
And thereafter, a number of magazines, newsletters published by other writers groups such as Western

01:35.280 --> 01:43.220
Writers of America, Romance Writers of America, Mystery Writers of America, took on the column

01:43.220 --> 01:45.920
because they felt their authors were in the same position.

01:47.380 --> 01:51.420
So actually, Locust then was your first magazine of that type that you wrote the column for?

01:51.420 --> 01:56.320
Yes, Locust was, I still consider myself as writing the column for Locust.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.360
Okay, fine.

01:58.540 --> 02:04.160
Would you be allowed to tell me which science fiction authors are just some of them that

02:04.160 --> 02:04.860
you do represent?

02:05.520 --> 02:07.220
Well, no, I don't mind at all.

02:07.460 --> 02:11.680
It's, I think, a fairly common knowledge in the science fiction community.

02:11.680 --> 02:22.700
Okay, we represent Harlan Ellison, Gregory Benford, Greg Behr, Elizabeth Lin, Bartha

02:22.700 --> 02:35.380
Randall, Barry Longhear, Warren Norwood, Jessica Sammonson, and I'd say three or four more.

02:38.380 --> 02:45.500
Okay, if you had to sell a decent manuscript by an unknown author, would you prefer to

02:45.500 --> 02:48.820
work with Romance, the Western, a mystery of science fiction?

02:48.940 --> 02:49.920
What sort of genre literature?

02:50.640 --> 02:56.220
Well, my orientation has always been the paperbacked original market.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.100
Not that my agency doesn't handle hard covers.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.380
They handle quite a lot of them.

03:02.120 --> 03:08.820
Dozens and dozens of hard covers, and many have been on the bestseller list, and book

03:08.820 --> 03:10.480
club selections, and so forth.

03:11.280 --> 03:19.460
But the really, the blood of the industry is the paperbacked market.

03:20.120 --> 03:27.080
The paperbacked market does break down into some fairly convenient genres, and agents,

03:27.080 --> 03:32.760
I guess, are a little bit like nomads, in that they follow the source of life.

03:33.900 --> 03:40.200
And in this case, for instance, the hot market right now is the contemporary romances.

03:40.840 --> 03:45.000
And so we have a very active department in the contemporary romances.

03:46.300 --> 03:55.880
Science fiction has become somewhat soft since the Star Trek Star Wars phenomenon.

03:57.380 --> 04:08.140
And although it's still a very active market, we have noticed a kind of sorting out of important

04:08.140 --> 04:11.800
writers from what they call the mid-list writers.

04:11.980 --> 04:22.840
That is to say, those writers who aren't quite of the rockbuster bestseller category, and

04:22.840 --> 04:29.000
yet they're better than what some people might refer to as hack writers.

04:29.380 --> 04:35.280
They find themselves in a market where there really isn't an audience anymore.

04:35.280 --> 04:45.300
So we have found that writers really have to choose between going to something else

04:45.300 --> 04:47.980
or becoming stars in the science fiction market.

04:48.420 --> 04:50.220
There's no middle ground anymore.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.320
And that's true of just about all the genres.

04:53.240 --> 05:04.160
Westerns, romance may be the place that is most open for new writers, inexperienced writers.

05:04.160 --> 05:11.220
But in the science fiction world, I think you must start with some advantage or you're going

05:11.220 --> 05:12.680
to have a tough struggle ahead of you.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.620
I think we've never spoken to an agent before.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.180
And there's always, from your perspective, I think you can answer certain questions

05:21.180 --> 05:23.620
that I think anybody else would have difficulty answering.

05:23.780 --> 05:28.140
And one of them I wanted to ask you is, from your perspective,

05:28.240 --> 05:31.800
what determines the popularity of a genre literature and paperback?

05:31.800 --> 05:35.420
Is it the publishers who create the taste or what's what causes?

05:35.720 --> 05:36.440
It's hard to say.

05:36.580 --> 05:40.600
Sometimes the publishers create the taste and sometimes the market,

05:42.520 --> 05:45.960
the consumer, creates the demand.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.140
And sometimes it's the agent.

05:49.940 --> 05:53.900
For instance, I find myself very often in speaking to publishers,

05:54.480 --> 05:56.440
I find myself in a double role.

05:56.440 --> 06:03.520
I keep my ears open and try to listen to what a publisher tells me about what he's able

06:03.520 --> 06:06.100
to sell and what he's not able to sell.

06:06.840 --> 06:12.860
And so I have a kind of passive role in that I pass along to authors what the publishers

06:12.860 --> 06:14.940
tell me the market is doing.

06:15.460 --> 06:22.980
However, if I begin to notice a trend, I then try to help create a market by turning

06:22.980 --> 06:28.060
to other publishers and saying, listen, I've had lunch the last couple of months

06:28.060 --> 06:35.020
with four publishers and they all tell me that hard science fiction is not as active

06:35.020 --> 06:36.740
as fantasy and sorcery.

06:37.620 --> 06:41.660
And so maybe you'd be interested in some sort of sorcery.

06:42.020 --> 06:47.460
So an agent is in the position of shaping the market once he begins to detect a trend.

06:50.340 --> 06:51.660
OK, that was interesting.

06:51.660 --> 06:55.240
I guess after reading a column, of course, I'm coming to understand how much influence

06:55.240 --> 06:56.120
an agent can have.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.640
I don't think I realized that before.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.060
OK, I think I know the answer to this.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.500
In fact, most of the questions I'm asking you, I have some idea of what you'll say

07:07.500 --> 07:10.480
because of what I've read of your work, but still need to ask it.

07:12.340 --> 07:15.720
I know that you have different contracts for different clients or different authors,

07:15.980 --> 07:20.140
but say a contract with any sort of author, not just science fiction, is it dependent

07:20.140 --> 07:24.600
upon if an author is new or established according to what kind of contract he gets?

07:25.460 --> 07:33.940
Well, I think authors and agents probably ought to try to penetrate through a lot of

07:33.940 --> 07:42.080
a lot of the haze that surrounds contractual negotiations and realize that the the essential

07:42.520 --> 07:45.320
in a contractual negotiation is who has the power.

07:47.020 --> 07:55.680
For the beginning author, the first author or the author of some work for minor markets,

07:56.340 --> 08:00.560
the power definitely rests for the publisher, with the publisher, the publisher.

08:01.440 --> 08:06.920
The author, in effect, is saying to the publisher, I will sign anything you hand me if you

08:07.480 --> 08:13.540
publish me. And the publisher says, well, I'm glad to hear that, because if you don't

08:13.540 --> 08:16.660
like our terms, we'll find somebody else to write for us.

08:17.120 --> 08:22.260
Now, obviously, the power in that equation lies with the publisher.

08:22.880 --> 08:27.540
However, as an author begins to develop, he has a following.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.280
His books begin to sell.

08:30.960 --> 08:34.940
His the prices that he gets for his work begin to escalate.

08:35.660 --> 08:37.320
He may have a bestseller.

08:38.900 --> 08:43.560
He now has other publishers interested in publishing him.

08:43.980 --> 08:47.320
And now the equation is on the other foot, if I may mix the metaphor.

08:48.140 --> 08:54.000
And it's now the author who said the publisher says, I will do anything to keep you.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.200
And the author says, well, then you'd better meet my terms, because there are plenty of

08:58.200 --> 09:03.940
publishers out there who will publish me if you don't like what I have, the terms that

09:03.940 --> 09:04.980
I'm ready to dictate.

09:05.540 --> 09:13.700
So when you get down to with this raw power and the agent tries to put himself in those

09:13.700 --> 09:20.660
the power vectors, I guess you would say, and get some sense of where they converge.

09:21.580 --> 09:26.820
And that's the point at which a contract materializes.

09:26.940 --> 09:34.200
The contract is a direct reflection of the power flow between the two parties.

09:34.200 --> 09:40.100
And at the point where they all interface, that is what a contract reads.

09:41.780 --> 09:42.580
That's excellent.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.080
Very good.

09:44.140 --> 09:45.740
You taught me just like you write, I think.

09:46.780 --> 09:48.180
I'm not sure that's good or bad.

09:49.220 --> 09:57.080
Listen, what the science fiction fans are, I think, more fanatic than other types.

09:57.240 --> 10:01.780
And a lot of them, of course, are interested in writing and doing something besides just

10:01.780 --> 10:02.280
reading it.

10:02.280 --> 10:06.780
If somebody had reasonable amount of talent, what would you advise an aspiring science fiction

10:06.780 --> 10:07.020
author?

10:07.160 --> 10:07.840
Where should he begin?

10:08.200 --> 10:09.720
Always begin with the magazine.

10:11.540 --> 10:18.380
You're absolutely right about science fiction fans being more fanatic, but they are also

10:19.280 --> 10:29.660
fortunate in having a place where they can begin in the shorter media, where most writers

10:29.660 --> 10:31.540
in other genres don't have the chance.

10:31.540 --> 10:36.560
I mean, there are very few places where a romance writer can contieve.

10:37.520 --> 10:43.900
You know, you can't write romance short stories unless you try to write some of the

10:43.900 --> 10:45.420
Slicker Women's magazines.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.080
And they're, of course, very demanding in what they accept.

10:50.900 --> 10:59.420
There used to be Western magazines, many, many of them, but almost all of them are gone now.

11:00.420 --> 11:07.940
Mystery magazines are still a couple of them, but it's not like what it used to be when I got

11:07.940 --> 11:10.200
into the business about 25 years ago.

11:10.820 --> 11:19.100
So one of the few remaining genres that invites new talent and cultivates it is science fiction,

11:19.140 --> 11:25.940
where you have very active magazine market and anthology market for original stories.

11:26.820 --> 11:33.600
You also have the conventions, of course, Western writers, romance writers, mystery writers also have

11:33.600 --> 11:41.920
their conventions, but certainly science fiction writers can out-convention anybody by ratio of 10 to 1.

11:42.320 --> 11:51.500
So there's a lot of interplay where authors are always talking to one another, meeting editors,

11:51.500 --> 11:58.500
meeting professional writers, and there's a much tighter unity than there is in any other genre.

11:59.180 --> 12:07.480
So I would definitely advise any aspiring science fiction writer to start writing in the magazine.

12:07.800 --> 12:18.640
In fact, even some of my well-known clients, I still tell them to continue writing for science fiction

12:18.640 --> 12:25.780
magazines, even though they may get peanuts for their work compared to what they can get writing books,

12:26.180 --> 12:34.600
because the exposure among both science fiction editors and science fiction fans is terribly important.

12:37.240 --> 12:41.940
Okay, I just have about one or two more in science fiction, and get on to some more general things.

12:43.200 --> 12:50.360
Would you happen to be working with any unpublished authors at present in science fiction that we might look for?

12:52.660 --> 12:55.180
That question kind of catches me unaware.

12:56.480 --> 13:02.260
We have a number of people that we're, you know, we are establishing.

13:03.380 --> 13:10.040
It's very hard to say because in spite of what I said a few moments ago about getting published in magazines,

13:10.040 --> 13:16.980
we're doing, like most other agents, we handle very little by way of short fiction.

13:17.520 --> 13:30.460
It's not profitable for an agent to handle science fiction stories, and there's very little that we can do for a short story writer that he or she can't do for him or herself.

13:31.460 --> 13:40.220
So by the time an author comes to us asking for representation, and we think that person might be interesting,

13:41.140 --> 13:50.920
he's probably had quite a number of stories published in the science fiction magazines.

13:50.920 --> 14:01.700
I will mention one, one author that I think is enormously talented, and will probably burst on the scenes within the next couple of years,

14:01.880 --> 14:08.640
and that's a writer named Dan Simmons, who's beginning to make some appearances in Omni and some of the other magazines.

14:08.920 --> 14:16.560
He's a very, very talented writer, and we are about to take on some of his longer work.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.680
Okay, one more on some...

14:20.680 --> 14:30.240
I should accord my thanks to Harlan Ellison, who was the first person to spot him and refer him to me.

14:31.940 --> 14:34.760
Okay, good. One more on science fiction.

14:36.940 --> 14:46.480
Are you working on selling, or do you have in your hands any big manuscripts from some of your name authors that might be published in the near future?

14:46.480 --> 14:56.940
Well, Gregory Benford has the author of Timescape, which was the Inebula Award winner in the novel category for 1981,

14:57.780 --> 15:02.440
has two novels coming out in the next year.

15:03.040 --> 15:13.500
One is Against Infinity, which is coming out in April, will be published by Timescape Books and Hardcover, a wonderful novel.

15:13.500 --> 15:28.120
And I believe next February, we will see in the ocean of... excuse me, Across the Sea of Suns, which is the sequel to In the Ocean of Night,

15:28.260 --> 15:30.780
and is the second novel in a trilogy.

15:30.780 --> 15:45.320
We also have what I consider a great novel in the making by Richard Grant, who's made some appearances in magazines,

15:45.940 --> 15:54.660
but turned in a spectacular novel, which is now being shaped somewhat and redone.

15:54.660 --> 16:04.700
But it's some of the most brilliant writing I've ever read, and those who have had an early look at it agree with me that it's a very impressive job.

16:05.180 --> 16:12.180
And I know that when that book is finished, I believe it's got that celebrate all over us.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.320
Okay, do you like trilogies?

16:17.420 --> 16:33.280
Yes, I like them and I encourage them. I feel they're a very comfortable form for science fiction writers, in fact, for non-science fiction writers as well.

16:37.080 --> 16:50.880
The beauty of a trilogy, of course, is from an ancient viewpoint, is in the kind of package deal that one can make where you not only sign an author up for a book,

16:50.940 --> 16:56.240
but you can sign him up for a sequel and a sequel after that.

16:56.240 --> 17:00.660
And the author knows where he's going to be two years from now.

17:00.720 --> 17:12.200
The publisher knows what he can expect over a couple of years, and unless the author one day runs out of steam or gets bored with characters that he developed in book one or two,

17:13.640 --> 17:22.720
you can see a cumulative effect in the sales of a trilogy where publication of book two makes people scurry for book one,

17:23.060 --> 17:33.620
and publication of book three causes the publisher to reissue books one and two, and then they put them in a box set and they're reviewed as a whole.

17:33.900 --> 17:39.500
It's a very nice way of publishing books, but not everybody has a sequel in them.

17:41.380 --> 17:45.540
Right. Why does an author with reasonable talent need an agent?

17:49.280 --> 18:02.920
There are very few authors who, once they achieve publication, are really able or even want to handle their own business

18:04.120 --> 18:10.980
until you become a full-blooded professional writer with a track record, as I said before.

18:11.660 --> 18:20.340
Most of your job is writing your magazine stuff, sending it out, and developing a magazine market.

18:21.440 --> 18:27.540
But once you begin selling, unless you really understand contractual language,

18:30.780 --> 18:34.260
then you're going to need an agent to interpret it for you.

18:34.960 --> 18:43.220
Also, most authors are not as objective about their work as an agent can be,

18:43.620 --> 18:48.560
and therefore they either demand too much or too little when they negotiate a contract.

18:48.560 --> 18:56.580
So an agent can help put things in perspective and can talk both publishers and authors into being reasonable.

18:57.440 --> 19:04.320
Agents can also exploit subsidiary rights that authors are only dimly aware of.

19:05.300 --> 19:15.380
And agents finally are able to help build an author's career by spotting that author's strengths and weaknesses

19:15.380 --> 19:23.220
and building, of course, on the strengths and developing their talents to the utmost.

19:24.020 --> 19:32.760
There are a few authors I know, most notably Isaac Asimov, who I don't believe has agents or at least not regular agents,

19:32.760 --> 19:38.840
and Isaac certainly has done okay for himself, although I think there are probably five dozen agents

19:38.840 --> 19:42.720
who have said to him, think how well you would have done if you'd have an agent.

19:44.420 --> 19:54.320
But most authors sooner or later feel that it is well worth the commission and other things to have somebody,

19:54.960 --> 20:01.100
particularly when you don't live in the New York area, which is the heart of the publishing world.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.240
You live in California or Nebraska or something like that.

20:06.180 --> 20:14.280
There's nothing so frightening as to be out of touch with a publisher and not having anybody that you can call to act on your behalf.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.980
Okay, a more personal question.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.820
Your book, How to Be Your Own Literary Agent, of course I haven't seen that yet,

20:22.900 --> 20:24.920
but are you trying to put yourself out of business with that?

20:25.420 --> 20:29.480
I don't think I will for the reasons that I just told you.

20:30.380 --> 20:45.660
The title may not be exactly accurate because although it is designed to help new authors get a foot in the door that they might not otherwise have,

20:46.320 --> 20:57.680
it's also aimed at the professional author who may have an agent who may be of the kind who simply signs on the dotted line

20:57.680 --> 21:01.180
when his agent sticks a contract under his nose.

21:01.960 --> 21:09.540
And those authors, I think, are usually the ones who end up discovering a couple of years down the road

21:09.540 --> 21:12.360
that they made a horrible mistake when they signed that contract.

21:12.360 --> 21:17.420
And why didn't their agent tell them about certain things?

21:18.220 --> 21:28.860
And so my feeling is that an enlightened author is probably an agent's best friend, whether he's represented by an agent or not.

21:29.260 --> 21:36.160
The more than an author knows about contracts and related subjects,

21:36.820 --> 21:47.540
the tougher he's going to be in dealing with the publishers and the more he's going to benefit the entire fraternity and sorority of authors in this country

21:47.540 --> 21:49.100
and make an agent's job easier.

21:49.380 --> 21:57.640
So I don't feel that I've contradicted myself by publishing a book called How to Be Your Own Literary Agent.

21:59.540 --> 22:03.780
Okay, as the title indicates then, that really is a how-to book.

22:03.780 --> 22:18.880
Well, it does tell you, for instance, if you're a new author, it tells you what genres are the ripliest ones to buy your work,

22:19.560 --> 22:27.140
how to write for them, how to package your work for them, how to get your work on the desk of an editor,

22:27.740 --> 22:30.220
and avoid the so-called flush pile.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.500
It tells you what to do if you should get an offer.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.680
It tells you how to negotiate on your own.

22:38.180 --> 22:44.740
It tells you how to oversee what your agent is doing if you should decide to turn your work over to an agent.

22:44.900 --> 22:47.680
It tells you how to hire and fire an agent.

22:47.680 --> 23:04.500
And it completely analyzes publishing contracts from start to finish and interprets each clause in a way that any author can certainly get an advantage by studying my suggestions.

23:07.020 --> 23:11.880
So really, I guess even the beginner would get some good out of the book.

23:12.120 --> 23:12.540
Absolutely.

23:14.300 --> 23:15.220
Okay, good.

23:15.220 --> 23:16.060
One more at the end.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.240
Let's see.

23:18.360 --> 23:26.600
Today is the 15th, three days of the official publication date, February 18th.

23:26.940 --> 23:27.840
Okay, very good.

23:28.840 --> 23:47.620
It's already created something of a controversy in New York because one of the chapters in the book is a somewhat outspoken attack on publishing accounting systems.

23:48.700 --> 24:08.040
The publishers have a tendency to do what I call creative accounting, which the bottom line is that they hold, hide, or misguide authors as to how much in royalties they're entitled to.

24:08.040 --> 24:20.720
And a couple of days ago, the New York Times picked up on that chapter and published an article under the headline, Agent Says Publishers Achieving Authors.

24:21.360 --> 24:33.420
So we've got what I consider very healthy controversy going and then certainly one that every author ought to be interested in because it really is the gut issue.

24:33.420 --> 24:45.340
I know many new authors and aspiring authors, all they want to know is who's going to publish my book and whatever they pay me, whatever advance I get is fine with me.

24:45.620 --> 25:02.020
But as they become more and more professional and experienced, they may wake up one day and realize that they're not getting everything that's owing to them because the publishers have obscured some of the royalty reporting systems

25:02.020 --> 25:09.120
that would enable an author to get his full due.

25:09.760 --> 25:26.760
And so I've tried to dispel some of the mystery around the reading of royalty statements so authors can get a better idea of what is being told to them and whether any money is being hidden.

25:29.480 --> 25:45.180
Okay, in reading your columns over a period of time, I think I've caught you saying a couple times that even with a lot of talent and even with a great manuscript, writers still may not make it because of the way the publishing industry is set up.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.480
Is that sort of a cynical attitude on your part?

25:47.480 --> 25:54.200
Well, I don't say it with any pride. I say it with a great deal of sadness.

25:57.100 --> 26:06.460
In the last couple of years, the prices of books have gone prohibitively high.

26:07.280 --> 26:20.920
A hardcover novel these days sells for anywhere from $15 to $20, and a paperback novel sells anywhere from $3 to $5 or even a little more.

26:22.980 --> 26:36.360
And the consumer, the book buyer, is shying away from the marketplace now because he seems to feel there are better ways to spend $20 or $5 even.

26:37.180 --> 26:47.120
As a result, the book sales have been dropping and the publishers have become more and more selective as to what they buy.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.640
Unfortunately, that all gets passed down to the author.

26:54.200 --> 27:04.200
And more and more frequently in the last couple of years, I have had to turn away, as all my colleagues in the agency business have had to do.

27:05.080 --> 27:19.920
I've had to turn away a number of very good books that were well written but didn't really fit into certain categories that I know are actively buying.

27:20.800 --> 27:26.040
And so what you end up with is a well-written book that really isn't saleable.

27:27.420 --> 27:33.760
And it can often break your heart to send a book like that back.

27:34.200 --> 27:43.360
It doesn't hurt you as much to send back a bad book as it does to send back a good one, but there's nothing guaranteeing that a good book is going to sell.

27:43.560 --> 27:50.220
And that, I would say, is possibly the major difference between publishing today and publishing 10 years ago.

27:52.260 --> 27:54.040
Okay, one more follow-up on that.

27:54.480 --> 28:01.020
Does the system, as you described, lead to sort of hack writing or writing that's not very good?

28:01.800 --> 28:12.540
No, quite the contrary. I think the level of writing is getting better because publishers don't need to publish hack writing anymore when they can get so many good writers.

28:12.540 --> 28:28.760
The market has shrunk, for instance, in the paperback field, whereas about two or three years ago there were, I would say, 13 active viable paperbacks ranging from the modest size ones to the giant.

28:30.040 --> 28:36.240
Several have gone out of business and three or four more have been absorbed into other companies.

28:36.240 --> 28:42.060
And now one can count six or seven paperback publishers' reps.

28:42.920 --> 28:53.120
And so the clamor to be published by those houses is increasing, and so the publishers can afford to be more selective than ever before.

28:53.120 --> 29:09.000
So my feeling is that although I don't like to use the word hack, that certainly the inferior writer is either going to have to try harder or he's going to drop out because there are just too many good writers waiting to take his place.

29:11.440 --> 29:20.660
Okay, Mr. Curtis, I have about 10 minutes left if you can spare that. I wanted to talk about some personal things about your background and your own work if you had the time for that.

29:20.840 --> 29:21.280
Absolutely.

29:24.060 --> 29:28.260
Okay. I was going to say how does one become an agent, but I guess I better ask how you became one.

29:28.900 --> 29:44.460
Well, when I think for a long time I always wanted to be a writer, and when I got out of college, I discovered that there were no real jobs for writers, so I decided to get into a related field publishing.

29:45.240 --> 29:55.700
I could not find a job at a publishing company, so I finally ended up working for a leading literary agency, Scott Merida.

29:56.640 --> 30:01.260
And there I stayed for some seven or eight years, and that was my apprenticeship.

30:02.880 --> 30:19.920
And after some seven years, I really did have an itch to write, and so I had been writing even while I worked for Scott Merida, so I left that firm and became a freelance writer.

30:20.060 --> 30:26.260
And of course, having been an agent, I was much better connected than most freelance writers could ever hope to be.

30:26.260 --> 30:33.260
So the transition was not as hard for me as it would be if somebody left some other job.

30:34.580 --> 30:46.800
I did a lot of magazine work, but eventually realized that the magazine market was in its twilight and began focusing on books.

30:46.800 --> 30:57.460
I wrote a lot of paperback novels, and then eventually got into such areas as collaboration, books on conservation.

30:58.660 --> 31:05.040
I found that I had a forte in the area of humor, so I did a number of satirical books.

31:06.000 --> 31:11.260
I wrote just about anything that people would pay money for, and it was a very, very good grounding.

31:12.520 --> 31:20.420
And after about five years of that, a number of my old clients looked me up and asked me if I would represent them.

31:21.020 --> 31:34.880
And since I was not making a fortune as a writer in spite of the fact that to date I've had about 45 books published, I decided that perhaps I would go back into agenting, and I started my own firm.

31:34.880 --> 31:46.940
And for two or three years, I was both a writer and a literary agent, and literally I had two deaths back to back with a swivel chair between them.

31:47.420 --> 31:53.940
And in the morning I would do one thing, and in the afternoon I would do another, and I would try not to let one contaminate the other.

31:53.940 --> 32:04.400
And eventually when I discovered that I could make more money on a few phone calls as an agent, then I could for four or five months writing books.

32:04.460 --> 32:12.000
It was pretty clear to me where my career was heading, but I have not given up my writing.

32:12.800 --> 32:21.760
The column, of course, is very satisfying, and from time to time I might take a crack at a commercial novel or a nonfiction book.

32:22.860 --> 32:28.480
I get up at five or six in the morning, I'll write for an hour or so, then I'll go to work.

32:29.560 --> 32:44.940
And although an hour a day may not seem like a lot, as most professional writers will tell you, over a period of a couple of months one can write a book at an hour a day as long as you stay with it and turn out something every day.

32:44.940 --> 32:51.100
So I do consider myself a literary agent with a side order of writing.

32:53.880 --> 33:06.980
In looking over the books that I know you've written in the past few years, it seems to me that a lot of your nonfiction books have been dealing with issues of social concern like the nuclear lessons, the inequality of American communities and so forth.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.260
Is that because of personal taste or because of your collaborators?

33:10.260 --> 33:20.200
Well, I take some pride in some of the work that I've done in the area of conservation.

33:22.960 --> 33:50.160
Around 1970 or so I was approached by a woman who had accumulated a great deal of quite terrifying information about the nuclear power industry, and she asked me to collaborate with her.

33:50.160 --> 34:19.200
So Adam, it was the first popular book on the dangers of nuclear power plants, and although it was supplanted later on by books published by people, authorities, scientists and PhDs, whereas we were only laymen and women, I like to think that that book did open the door to discussion

34:20.160 --> 34:32.400
of the nuclear power issues, which finally culminated in the Three Mile Island accident years later, and I was able to say that I had told you so.

34:33.120 --> 34:40.480
Many of the things that happened were predicted in that book years earlier, and of course nobody really wanted to listen.

34:42.180 --> 34:48.780
So I have written some other books of social value, and I'm very proud of them.

34:49.780 --> 35:06.020
I'm also, if I may add, very proud as an Asian to have brought into the world many books on social issues and things like that.

35:06.020 --> 35:23.260
And we recently handled a magnificent first novel about the Vietnam War called The Thirteenth Valley, which went on the bestseller list, and opened the door to what I know will now be a state of Vietnam fiction.

35:23.920 --> 35:40.960
Up until that time, people had said that nobody really wanted to read about Vietnam, and so we've now enabled some fresh air to grow into the marketplace with that novel, and again, this is an accomplishment that I'm very proud of.

35:45.700 --> 35:51.680
What about your fiction, your novel? Can you give me an idea of what kind of things you write about, if they sell well?

35:51.680 --> 36:11.060
Well, a couple years ago, while I was still, well, more than that, about a decade ago, I conceived a paperback series featuring a hero that I always thought was rather unusual.

36:11.060 --> 36:27.360
He was a detective in the area of sports, and a series of books featuring this hero was, the series was called The Pro, and the books were published by Warner.

36:27.360 --> 36:53.680
We did four of those, and at the moment I'm trying to revive that series or something along those lines, because right now, although there's a great deal of male action-adventure fiction being published, everybody's getting bored with the same old heroes, the mercenaries, the dirty dozens, and series like that.

36:54.550 --> 37:06.500
So I'm trying to get revived this hero that I think is a rather refreshing one, but I'm not able to do too much in the fiction area simply because of time.

37:09.300 --> 37:22.600
Well, Kay, I just have a couple more here. I remember reading one of your columns where you mentioned, I guess it was an innovation on your part as an agent, where you contracted with a publicity firm for your clients and so forth.

37:22.760 --> 37:30.520
I wondered if you've, things like that that you've done for your clients, it might be a little different or innovative or whatever?

37:30.520 --> 37:59.540
Well, every agent, of course, is trying to seek a better way to handle his clients and more advantages for his clients, and one of the things that upsets me deeply is the fact that publishers are very reluctant to spend promotional money on any authors except the big name celebrity authors.

37:59.540 --> 38:29.480
And so I attempted, a couple of years ago, to rectify that by asking my clients in effect to chip in. Each one of them would be, in effect, taxed a couple of extra percentage points of commission, and that tax would go towards a fund which we used to hire a publicity agent.

38:29.540 --> 38:49.160
Who would publicize the little guy. And some of the campaigns were quite successful. Some aspects of the campaign were not so successful, and it was because of the inconsistency of the results that we finally dropped the program.

38:49.160 --> 39:06.580
But some of it has had lasting results, and it certainly created a lot of talk in the industry and among authors. And it was, I thought, a noble experiment in the area of getting the lesser known authors publicized.

39:06.580 --> 39:22.320
But it's still difficult. The market inclines towards the big name, and the struggle to become a big name is extremely intense, and very, very few people emerge.

39:26.060 --> 39:33.800
Okay. What about movie deals for books that are worthy of it? Do you actively seek the matter? Do movie houses come to you?

39:33.800 --> 39:58.720
Well, it's a combination. Most books that are published, that are of any value at all, are covered by the movie studios, producers, and the people in New York whose job it is to scout on behalf of various Hollywood interests.

39:58.720 --> 40:14.500
So the chances are that if you have any, if an agent is handling a good book at all, it will have been seen in one way or another by producers, directors, studio people, and so forth.

40:14.500 --> 40:27.260
But they have amazing ways of getting hold of manuscripts no matter how secretive you try to be. And so wrong before you're ready to show them, they've already been exposed.

40:29.080 --> 40:44.460
Nevertheless, if we get a hot manuscript, and we really think it's going to make a terrific book, we actively try to find a movie producer for it. And so sometimes the deals come to us and sometimes we generate them.

40:48.340 --> 41:05.420
Okay. That's about, I mean, there's lots of questions. I could keep on talking for a long time, but I think we have enough and we've taken enough of your time. But listen, is there anything I haven't asked that you think listeners should know or anything at all that you'd like to talk about, or we still have some tape left?

41:08.400 --> 41:32.800
No, we're happy to answer any, you know, any other questions you may have. I will say that we were talking about innovations before. I may be springing a very radical proposition on the publishing industry that I believe will create a lot of talk and controversy, and I'm not doing it just to publicize myself.

41:32.800 --> 42:00.160
I'm not doing it just to publicize myself, but I've begun to, because of my deep concern about royalty accounting and how publishers have managed to manipulate and hide author's royalties, I'm going to be making a proposal to the publishing industry about a radically different way of accounting royalties, based not on sales, but on copies printed.

42:00.160 --> 42:21.500
And I would say that within the next few months, you might begin looking for some stirring in that area. And I believe it could have some rather radical effects on the way people think about the traditional way of accounting royalties.

42:23.040 --> 42:29.480
I remember some of your columns, I think you sort of hinted at certain things about the way the publishers did that.

42:29.840 --> 42:51.480
Right. Well, I actually do suggest something like it in my book, but I will now be amplifying on it. And if I can get some of the publishing media to pick up on these suggestions, it should make for a very, very lively dialogue, and certainly one that's well-known to do in this 18th century business.

42:52.540 --> 43:01.780
Well, I'll take it then in the... Let's say the three-part relationship here, a writer, an agent and a publisher, that you would say probably the publisher has much the best of it?

43:02.440 --> 43:20.200
No, I don't think so at all. I've heard everybody accuse everybody else of having the best of it. There are rich agents, there are agents who are struggling, there are rich authors and authors who are struggling, and there are rich publishers and there are publishers who are struggling.

43:22.180 --> 43:29.120
I, in spite of some of the belligerent things I may have said, I have a great, great many

43:29.120 --> 43:33.340
friends among the publishers, and I want to see them do well.

43:34.380 --> 43:41.980
And so I've come to think of it as a symbiotic environment in which everybody really does

43:41.980 --> 43:43.380
depend on everybody else.

43:44.920 --> 43:53.700
And an agent's job is not just to negotiate contracts, but to negotiate interests so that

43:53.700 --> 43:57.500
nobody gets so badly hurt that he can't carry on.

43:59.060 --> 44:08.060
I mean, publishers are always complaining about their overhead, and it's well to remind

44:08.060 --> 44:10.760
them that agents have to pay their rent also.

44:11.280 --> 44:18.820
But some agents get very greedy, and they feel that the only way for an author to become

44:18.820 --> 44:25.100
famous is to pin the publisher to the wall with a cruel deal.

44:26.220 --> 44:32.780
And sometimes they can backfire in terms of how much money is left after you've hit a

44:32.780 --> 44:33.720
publisher that hard.

44:33.720 --> 44:42.000
How much money is left for the struggling author, the paperback publisher that consistently

44:42.000 --> 44:50.680
pays two or three million dollars for one or two authors is going to find himself neglecting

44:51.400 --> 44:54.040
the new author because he can't afford to pay him.

44:54.260 --> 45:00.380
Or if he should buy a new author's work, he won't have any money left to publicize or

45:00.380 --> 45:01.680
promote that author's book.

45:02.190 --> 45:11.280
So there's something even to be said for not being greedy on behalf of your authorism

45:11.280 --> 45:14.120
and giving the publisher an even break.
