00:05.120 --> 00:06.700
Okay, maybe just a brief statement.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.160
Have you always been a full-time writer?

00:11.180 --> 00:11.420
Yep.

00:14.820 --> 00:17.560
I went effectively out of...

00:18.400 --> 00:19.340
I just started at the beginning.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.140
I've never been anything but a writer, actually.

00:23.980 --> 00:31.820
I entered the University of Minnesota in 1939 when I was 15 years old and began work toward

00:31.820 --> 00:35.120
a degree for creative writing with a major in creative writing.

00:36.820 --> 00:43.540
And World War II came along before I was able to get my BA.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.960
So I was out for three or four years.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.380
I forget which, something like that.

00:49.380 --> 00:52.100
Then I went back and spent another two years and went into graduate school.

00:53.100 --> 00:57.080
At the time, it's about the only time in my life when I ever considered doing anything

00:57.080 --> 00:57.640
but writing.

00:57.840 --> 01:05.040
I was playing with the idea then of holding down a teaching job, going on and getting my

01:05.520 --> 01:10.580
doctorate in English and teaching and doing the writing on the side.

01:11.660 --> 01:13.780
After World War II, we were all hypersensible.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.120
Everybody was very cool-headed.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.760
Let's have this nonsense over with.

01:21.100 --> 01:22.160
Get down and get to work someplace.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.400
And luckily I came out of that and said, this is silly.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.460
I'd never intended to do anything but writing.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.860
And instead of having the teaching pay for the writing, why not make the writing pay

01:30.860 --> 01:31.320
for the writing?

01:32.140 --> 01:37.120
So I simply dived out of graduate school into full-time writing for the magazines.

01:38.060 --> 01:39.920
There were still quite a few magazines around.

01:40.740 --> 01:45.380
There were still a fair number of pulp magazines, for example.

01:45.860 --> 01:50.520
The slick magazines paid a great deal more, but they were chancy.

01:51.700 --> 01:56.280
The slick magazines, what they wanted from week to week would depend on what the theme

01:56.280 --> 01:57.640
of that particular issue was.

01:57.820 --> 02:02.140
In other words, they might like you and they might like what you write and so on and so

02:02.140 --> 02:02.380
forth.

02:02.520 --> 02:09.380
But if you'd written a story about blowworms and they wanted one, a fiction story that involved

02:09.380 --> 02:15.200
blowworms, and they wanted one about cowboys on the western plains, then they didn't want

02:15.200 --> 02:16.040
that particular story.

02:16.540 --> 02:18.060
And there would be no place else to send it.

02:18.720 --> 02:22.220
The pulp magazines, on the other hand, if you wrote a science fiction story, there were

02:22.220 --> 02:25.860
a number of science fiction magazines or a number of detective or a number of western.

02:27.520 --> 02:36.020
So actually I dived in and kept myself afloat writing for the magazines for about three or

02:36.020 --> 02:40.680
four years and then I, somewhere about 1954, I did my first science fiction novel.

02:40.680 --> 02:46.060
So I d been full time as a writer since 1950.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.640
Now I'd sold things before then.

02:48.220 --> 02:55.740
I'd sold a magazine piece I think as early as 1942 and I'd had something in a magazine,

02:56.560 --> 03:00.920
a short short story in a magazine section of Minneapolis paper and I'd been in the Toronto

03:01.780 --> 03:08.120
Star Weekly, which was a magazine supplement that went along with the Toronto Star Journal.

03:08.940 --> 03:09.720
Star Journal?

03:10.760 --> 03:12.640
I can't remember the name of the newspaper.

03:15.020 --> 03:21.340
See, you see the thing is that I always intended to be a writer and about for the first 30

03:21.340 --> 03:24.920
years of my life I was simply looking for the type of thing I wanted to write.

03:25.780 --> 03:27.480
I cut my teeth on poetry.

03:28.060 --> 03:32.180
If I'd been born in the late 19th century I would have been at home because I would

03:32.660 --> 03:39.060
have done long narrative poems like Idols of the King, you know, Tennyson's and Iowa's

03:39.060 --> 03:39.940
and things like this.

03:41.180 --> 03:47.940
As it is we're in a non-plotic age and I finally ended up saying well to do what I want to

03:47.940 --> 03:50.300
do I'm going to have to use the medium of historical novels.

03:51.360 --> 03:56.400
And then simply because Megatheans were putting bread and butter on the table and I found out

03:56.400 --> 04:02.840
I liked science fiction best, I liked writing science fiction best, I ended up doing essentially

04:02.840 --> 04:04.220
nothing but science fiction.

04:05.080 --> 04:10.000
And as I did this I came to realize the possibilities in that particular field for what I wanted

04:10.000 --> 04:10.460
to do.

04:11.320 --> 04:17.520
And of course what I wanted to do is now take in shape long since 20 years ago as the

04:17.520 --> 04:22.060
child cycle of novels which is when it's done we'll cover a thousand years.

04:23.320 --> 04:29.280
There'll be three historical novels starting with one about Sir John Hawkwood who was an

04:31.020 --> 04:38.000
Englishman in the 13th century who ended up as Captain General of the Military Forces

04:38.000 --> 04:49.340
for Florence, Italy and will end in the 23rd century with Child, C. H. I. L. D. E., the novel

04:49.340 --> 04:52.360
from which the whole series takes its name.

04:53.160 --> 05:01.640
And the whole series effectively, the stories don't chronologically follow each other, they're

05:01.640 --> 05:07.640
connected thematically and what they represent is sort of a literary thematic argument something

05:07.640 --> 05:15.600
that has never been done before actually which argues, a philosophical point in fact, it

05:15.600 --> 05:19.240
argues that we're undergoing evolution right now.

05:19.240 --> 05:24.180
It's not physical evolution or mental evolution, it's a, there's no really good word for it,

05:24.180 --> 05:27.940
you would call it spiritual evolution but that isn't right either, it's an ethical evolution.

05:28.860 --> 05:33.680
We're, of necessity we're evolving what I call a responsible human being and we're

05:33.680 --> 05:39.600
sort of halfway there from the time of the third, look at from the viewpoint of the 13th

05:39.600 --> 05:46.500
century toward the 23rd we're halfway to developing the responsible human being.

05:47.340 --> 05:55.500
If you assume that old, insanity is going to be brought under control unless civilization

05:55.500 --> 06:01.960
goes crash within the next 50 or 100 years, if not a lot sooner, that is going to give

06:01.960 --> 06:07.420
you a population of sane people but even a population of sane people can have individuals

06:07.420 --> 06:10.400
who for their own purposes are willing to destroy things.

06:11.600 --> 06:22.600
Now back in the days of the flit acts and the stone club, if a particular key man decided

06:22.600 --> 06:27.180
to run wild and start bobbing people over the head he could probably kill two or three

06:27.180 --> 06:33.060
others before everybody ganged up on him and stopped him and that escalated up to our time

06:33.060 --> 06:40.380
where somebody who knows how can set up a laboratory in the basement and blow up a lot

06:40.400 --> 06:47.780
of the whole, a large sized city or part of a state and you extrapolate the curve of

06:47.780 --> 06:57.100
destructive possibility and you see that within well probably less than the three to 500

06:57.100 --> 07:03.460
years I give us, you're going to have a situation where any individual can destroy the whole

07:03.460 --> 07:07.620
race, not less some such sense of the responsibility is developed.

07:08.620 --> 07:14.480
And what the historical novels do and the contemporary novels do is what a good hard

07:14.480 --> 07:19.640
science fiction story does and that is they lay out the evidence of what we know and then

07:19.640 --> 07:24.160
extrapolate forward from there saying alright if this and this and this is so and we know

07:24.160 --> 07:31.100
it to be so then doesn't this develop from it, you know and if I'm wrong and my hypothesis

07:31.820 --> 07:40.200
point out where I'm wrong and so the whole cycle becomes essentially sort of one large

07:40.200 --> 07:47.200
science fiction story even though it covers historical, contemporary and future novels.

07:49.540 --> 07:52.700
Okay excellent you've answered about five or six of my questions there.

07:54.280 --> 08:00.700
I get into having to do you see I have a part time lecturer and platform speaker and I get

08:00.700 --> 08:03.740
off on this topic and I tend to run with it.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.820
Well listen I take it from what you said and from what I understand from your work that

08:08.820 --> 08:10.680
essentially you're an optimist about man's future.

08:11.420 --> 08:17.720
Oh yes, yes and the evidence is there for optimism. In fact if you look at things historically

08:17.720 --> 08:22.400
you'll find that pessimism has always been the short term view and optimism has been

08:22.400 --> 08:29.760
the long term view. What survives in the way of philosophy and literature and history and

08:29.760 --> 08:39.820
so on and so forth shows a general overall improvement and development of society. At

08:40.320 --> 08:43.760
any given moment you look around yourself and you say my god I don't see how we can

08:43.760 --> 08:51.260
last out the year, you know five years at the outside but they've been saying that since

08:51.260 --> 08:59.440
Egyptian days. You know these old jokes about the archaeologists looking at the, you know

08:59.760 --> 09:03.960
writing inside the pyramid and saying you know there is no hope.

09:06.580 --> 09:13.140
Well the human race is simply going downhill. The present generation doesn't know anything

09:13.140 --> 09:18.420
and the old generation has given up and we've got problems that are too big for us to handle

09:18.420 --> 09:23.600
so what hope is there for us? If it's always looked that way from the static point in history

09:25.680 --> 09:32.880
that attitude is going to have to change though because beginning with the 1960s particularly

09:32.880 --> 09:42.180
but even before then unconsciously this change was coming about we're developing a generation

09:42.180 --> 09:47.740
and we have a generation right now that realizes they stand on a moving sidewalk. You can see

09:47.740 --> 09:53.060
history, you can see the world changing around you as you stand because of technological advances.

09:53.620 --> 10:03.000
In other words 100 to 150 years ago if you were gifted with intelligence and ambition

10:03.000 --> 10:09.780
and a certain amount of luck and possibilities you could say when I grow up I'm going to

10:09.780 --> 10:13.500
work hard and get rich and I'm going to have a white house on the hill with a coach and

10:13.500 --> 10:21.560
six fine horses and if you could point to the hill and my gosh 40 years later if you

10:21.560 --> 10:25.700
had done what you set out to do you could be on that hill with that house and those

10:25.700 --> 10:33.780
horses. Nowadays you say 40 years from now I'd like to have such and so and if it's

10:33.780 --> 10:39.340
an equivalent of a house on the hill and so on and so forth by the time you get there

10:39.340 --> 10:47.500
they may not have houses. They'll say let alone white houses and they won't be using

10:47.500 --> 10:52.400
horses or whatever our present formal transportation is and the hill may have been both those flat

10:52.400 --> 11:00.280
for that matter. In other words living is becoming a situation in which intelligent people will

11:00.280 --> 11:07.280
have to keep learning all their lives simply to keep up and keep adjusting. Now this implies

11:07.280 --> 11:13.860
a necessary flexibility that was not in existence before. History changed things but they changed

11:13.860 --> 11:17.680
things so slowly that people could pretend that in their own lifetime there was no change.

11:20.300 --> 11:27.100
Okay very good. To be a little more specific about your child cycle I think if I recall

11:27.100 --> 11:32.740
it was a 1959 astounding that the the Dorsi series started. How much of your future history

11:32.740 --> 11:40.680
had you conceived at that time? What date was that? It was a 1959 astounding the Dorsi

11:40.680 --> 11:47.900
story the Genique General was published. Oh yes well actually the astounding astounding

11:49.460 --> 11:56.760
did it under his proper title which was Dorsi. It was eight books at that time that changed

11:56.760 --> 12:01.760
it to that crazy title of the genetic general which has since been buried you know back to

12:01.760 --> 12:06.360
calling it Dorsi again. It came out in the magazine as a serial under the title Dorsi.

12:07.520 --> 12:24.000
Actually that was written in 1958 and as the cycle as it's in a printout form if you want

12:24.000 --> 12:31.140
to describe it that way wasn't in existence at that time. What had happened was that from

12:31.140 --> 12:36.180
the time when I was very young see I decided to as one of these kids that taught myself

12:36.180 --> 12:44.260
to read when I was about four years old I did it by the well known method of being read

12:44.260 --> 12:49.080
to a lot and as a child you memorized the stories you read to and I would pick up a book and

12:49.080 --> 12:53.460
pretend to read it and the priest and I began to connect what I was saying with what was

12:53.460 --> 13:00.060
on the paper and I was fascinated with stories. I said this is what I want to do and from

13:00.060 --> 13:06.840
then on I was looking for what specifically I wanted to do with this and as I grew up

13:06.840 --> 13:13.560
and the ideas developed it came that I wanted to do a large work that had a particular application

13:14.500 --> 13:22.620
to literature and to my time. In other words I had the rough pattern of what I was after

13:22.620 --> 13:30.040
but it hadn't coalesced. It was misty around the edges. Back in 1948 after work I was a

13:30.060 --> 13:34.900
member of the Civil War II when I was in graduate school I was working on a historical novel

13:34.900 --> 13:42.500
called The Pipeman which was about 15th century Italy as half of it is 14th century actually

13:44.480 --> 13:50.340
and it's about a young member of one of the levees of Swiss Pipeman who comes down into

13:50.340 --> 13:55.900
Italy and sees the civilization down there and looks at it through this clean pair of

13:55.900 --> 14:05.300
northern amoral mountaineers essentially because this is the explosion, the explosive

14:05.300 --> 14:15.820
beginning of the Renaissance you see. Now after I'd done Dorsi later on see when I started

14:15.820 --> 14:19.160
to make a living writing short stories I didn't have time to sit down and write at all. You

14:19.160 --> 14:24.860
have to take six months at least out to do a decent job and how you keep the wolf from

14:24.860 --> 14:29.480
the door during those six months if you're living hand to mouth from short story income

14:29.480 --> 14:38.920
is a question. And so I simply didn't get around to writing a novel until I had the

14:38.920 --> 14:45.180
money to do so. When I did I wrote it under a good deal of pressure and pretty much of

14:45.180 --> 14:52.940
a hurry and I came up with Dorsi and this first novel and after I'd done it the following

14:52.940 --> 15:01.300
summer I was at the Milford Science Fiction Conference. Now this was a my invitation only

15:01.300 --> 15:05.480
conference for those of us who were professional science fiction writers. It was held every

15:08.020 --> 15:15.800
June up in the Catskill and I used to go in spite of the fact that the various pollens

15:15.800 --> 15:20.060
up there at that time would trigger off my asthma and I wouldn't sleep for a week and

15:20.060 --> 15:29.600
I'd be. I began to be afflicted by asthma during World War II and it would have been

15:29.600 --> 15:33.480
a miserable time but it hadn't been such a magnificent time because it was our chance

15:33.480 --> 15:40.140
to sit around and talk shop. We'd have the afternoons where we would read each other's

15:40.140 --> 15:44.280
manuscripts and criticize them in the evenings we'd sit around and debate some particular

15:44.280 --> 15:48.640
writerly topic or something but mostly it was simply knocking heads with your fellow

15:48.640 --> 15:56.180
wizards that made it worthwhile and while I was up there I hit one night one asthmatic

15:56.180 --> 16:03.460
night when I was exhausted and I thought well maybe I'll sleep through and asthmatics tell

16:03.460 --> 16:10.620
me this of course you don't. I woke up an hour later and saw it. Now people who don't

16:10.620 --> 16:15.120
know asthma don't realize that it isn't a matter of getting breath in it's a matter

16:15.120 --> 16:22.280
of getting breath out. You swell up with air that you can't exhale and your adrenaline

16:22.740 --> 16:27.920
level goes off the top of the map. Your physically incapacitated mind just gallops. Now we were

16:27.920 --> 16:32.340
way off in the woods effectively and there was nothing to be done till dawn at which

16:32.340 --> 16:37.900
time other people would be up and they could drive me to the nearest doctor or clinic or

16:37.900 --> 16:44.660
what have you and so I just had nothing to do but sit there for five hours and wait for

16:45.120 --> 16:52.880
the sunrise and in that time I worked out the pattern for this cycle completely from soup

16:52.880 --> 17:00.940
to nuts with every book in its place or rather every I shouldn't say every book because the

17:00.940 --> 17:05.580
numbers of books have doubled because of the size of what's being done but it's a case

17:05.580 --> 17:10.620
of the original books more or less being split down the middle you see because they're too

17:10.620 --> 17:17.420
big to publish as a chunk. The whole thing laid itself out and when the sun did rise

17:18.180 --> 17:27.080
or the sun came up I mean I went and talked over with one of our fellow visitors who was

17:28.140 --> 17:34.500
a man named Richard Bacchina who wrote a novel called The Sand Pebble which from which

17:34.500 --> 17:42.120
a movie was made that older people may remember a little bit. The Sand Pebbles was not a science

17:42.120 --> 17:50.400
fiction movie. McKenna had been in the Navy all his life and it was about China actually

17:50.400 --> 18:00.920
at the time of the Boxer but it had been a very big thick novel as the cycle was a very

18:00.920 --> 18:08.040
referenced and we tapped there and kicked it around. Essentially what he did for me

18:08.040 --> 18:16.760
he just like throwing a ball against a wall in the process of trying to explain it to

18:16.760 --> 18:24.240
him I put my thoughts into words and curiously enough what was worked out that one night

18:24.240 --> 18:31.540
has never really been changed about ten years later toward the end of the sixties I ran

18:31.540 --> 18:36.580
across a situation where I thought well I'll just change it around and I tried to buy

18:36.580 --> 18:45.800
it but it wouldn't change. It was too interlocked with actual history and patterns of development

18:45.800 --> 18:54.220
that I had had working from twenty years before I got the different things that I had

18:54.240 --> 19:02.160
in the cycle plan itself. Okay in other words what you've done is to look back into history

19:02.160 --> 19:07.620
and extrapolate from what has happened to what is happening now to what will happen in the

19:07.620 --> 19:14.000
future. That's right yes and saying that as I see it we are traveling this direction and

19:14.660 --> 19:24.140
this is my evidence and see if you can find any evidence to disprove what I project.

19:24.760 --> 19:29.420
This is this is this attitude this is what I took from science fiction this is what I

19:29.420 --> 19:36.400
found in science fiction that was so useful and it was the core of the magazine that John

19:36.400 --> 19:42.360
Campbell published in Astounding which later became a log. The hard science fiction story

19:42.360 --> 19:50.200
that says this is this is the legitimate hypothesis. Attack it if you can.

19:52.640 --> 19:57.040
Okay I think a lot of people who don't know all of your work would mostly associate you

19:57.040 --> 20:01.420
with the Dorsi novel and I've read that some people consider you to be a militarist because

20:01.420 --> 20:09.960
of that. I don't think that's fair do you? Well actually it isn't really the cycle

20:09.960 --> 20:15.160
is made with three archetypes. One of which is the warrior and one of which is the philosopher

20:15.160 --> 20:26.840
and one of which is the faith holder. And each book showcases one of these types. For

20:26.840 --> 20:32.980
example Sir John Hawkewood is obviously a warrior. The second historical novel deals with John

20:32.980 --> 20:37.280
Milton not as a poet but as a propagandist essentially for the promillion government

20:37.280 --> 20:43.440
during the period when he was writing his tracks for the cause. So we have a faith holder

20:43.440 --> 20:50.360
here and the faith holder he's ideal for my needs as a faith holder archetype because

20:50.360 --> 20:55.380
he shows the two faces of the faith holder. The faith holder is actually Jenna's face

20:55.380 --> 21:00.740
you know the old Roman god at the entrance of the Roman houses that looked both in and

21:00.740 --> 21:09.280
out at two faces. The two faces of the faith holder is the fanatic and the true faith holder.

21:10.180 --> 21:16.620
The word faith doesn't quite cover it. It's somebody who is clearly committed to faith

21:16.620 --> 21:20.620
they believe in as opposed to the fanatic who essentially uses the faith for their own

21:22.120 --> 21:30.980
purpose. Now the historical novel will show the warrior, the faith holder and the philosopher

21:33.620 --> 21:39.040
in the person of people we can look up in history books. The 20th century will show

21:39.040 --> 21:46.240
them at work in our century. The future ones show them in the projected and problematical

21:46.720 --> 21:53.440
future but the warrior is only one of three types all of which equally necessary. The

21:53.440 --> 21:58.940
philosopher and the faith holder for example finally the book that's now in my publisher's

21:58.940 --> 22:05.520
hands it's 1400 manuscript pages long and will be coming out in about a year now within

22:05.520 --> 22:15.520
the next year hopefully will be a great big book is really it's part of the closing scene

22:16.510 --> 22:25.160
of the whole dog on panorama that the cycle represents. So it's hero is all things both

22:25.160 --> 22:35.500
warrior faith holder and philosopher but it has a very strong influence on the world

22:36.220 --> 22:42.020
in this particular book because there's two more to come after this these will be consecutive

22:42.020 --> 22:48.460
these will be prequel, sequel, post sequel. Final encyclopedia then chanterelle, then

22:48.460 --> 22:55.000
child will really be three parts of one there'll be a trilogy effectively the story will be

22:55.000 --> 23:00.420
continuous in other words but this first one the final encyclopedia deals mainly with

23:00.420 --> 23:07.600
the attitude of the faith holder this is essentially what my multi hero who is really

23:07.600 --> 23:14.620
a reincarnation although reincarnation is not the proper word it's the second really

23:17.660 --> 23:24.480
the third life I should say of the man who was the hero of Dorsey Donald Reign and he

23:24.480 --> 23:31.500
was Donald Reign effectively he animated went back in time and animated the dead body because

23:31.500 --> 23:39.040
he can't change the past to exist as Paul Forman and necromancer and now he goes forward

23:39.040 --> 23:49.740
and becomes Tim pardon me not Tim but Halney in the last three books and in final encyclopedia

23:49.740 --> 23:57.820
Halney essentially fully becomes fully developed as in his faith holder part now the reason

23:57.820 --> 24:06.580
the emphasis on the military is there is for two reasons one is this caught this caught

24:06.580 --> 24:14.980
the eye of the publishers and they package the books as military oriented books and in

24:14.980 --> 24:20.700
fact the ones that dealt with warrior types like Donald Reign the first one Dorsey where

24:20.700 --> 24:27.100
Donald Reign is a warrior archetype were it would legitimate to it that way but then they

24:27.100 --> 24:32.700
began publishing all the things in this way that is part of it the other part of it is

24:32.700 --> 24:39.360
that all since all the cycle must be sound must be watertight is that the military elements

24:39.360 --> 24:46.680
in there are justified are logicalized so it's not I don't blame people for being

24:46.680 --> 24:53.400
let astray in this particular fashion but if they will look closely at the cycle they

24:53.400 --> 24:59.720
will see it isn't true and about the only people I have any quarrel with those who without

24:59.720 --> 25:05.760
reading the things simply make the assumption that this is a military early is pardon me

25:05.760 --> 25:12.860
military strictly oriented series of books okay I just have about two or three more

25:12.860 --> 25:19.360
can you handle that oh sure okay listen I'm okay Donald Reign I'll tell you what would

25:19.360 --> 25:23.340
you give could you cut it for just a second here I'm gonna have to get something to get

25:23.340 --> 25:33.060
my my voice tends to give out on me and no trouble no trouble right what was the where

25:33.060 --> 25:42.120
were we okay I was just gonna ask about Donald Reign now he's got a vision or intuition

25:42.120 --> 25:48.300
he's the future of man and so forth why would you have that vision come from a dorsi warrior

25:48.300 --> 26:03.040
say rather than an exotic well he doesn't have a vision what what he has is what he

26:03.040 --> 26:09.040
has it there's the same relation to ordinary logical process let's say calculus plate

26:09.040 --> 26:16.300
page you know has some arithmetic this is merely a tool now I'm going to be substantiating

26:16.700 --> 26:28.820
this tool in the historical and contemporary things there's this type of thinking is in

26:28.820 --> 26:36.420
its embryo form right now you know there's evidence of it just as I don't know have you

26:36.420 --> 26:42.400
read soldier ask that yes I have all right when you remember there's a artifact in there

26:42.400 --> 26:50.540
called the final encyclopedia and the final encyclopedia is not something is is substantiated

26:51.680 --> 27:02.620
by something called the theater of memory that was developed in the early part of the

27:02.620 --> 27:09.500
Renaissance about well early the mid part of the Renaissance actually and again the aim

27:09.500 --> 27:16.140
was was to get all knowledge together in a single handleable form which is something in

27:16.140 --> 27:23.400
the 20th century we're approaching through computer science all these things hook together

27:23.400 --> 27:31.420
there the pattern of thought the trick of thinking that is intuitive logic if I call

27:31.420 --> 27:46.120
intuitive logic and that Donald uses in in dorsi and which will surface again actually in the

27:47.480 --> 27:53.360
final encyclopedia and will will become one of the tools that give access to the creative

27:53.360 --> 27:59.340
universe which is what the whole cycle aims at all along because one of the arguments

27:59.340 --> 28:03.740
of the cycle cycle makes various arguments as I said it's main one is that we're in

28:03.740 --> 28:09.240
process of evolution even though we don't know it right now we're part way toward the

28:09.240 --> 28:16.520
development of the responsible human being particularly in western culture but one of

28:16.520 --> 28:26.660
the other arguments is that we are see what were we we were off on theater of memory intuition

28:26.660 --> 28:37.380
logic we are beginning to develop now the uses of our own mind and body that were more

28:37.380 --> 28:44.520
or less dreamed of only at earlier time just as for example modern technology was a dream

28:45.180 --> 28:54.760
of primitive man again the flint worker the flint worker dreamed of being able to turn

28:54.760 --> 29:03.020
the rain off well never found out how to turn the rain off or turn the rain on until now

29:03.020 --> 29:07.500
we can turn rain on we haven't yet hit the point where we turned off but that's right

29:07.500 --> 29:15.040
over the making horizon what they came up with instead were shelters then they wanted

29:15.040 --> 29:21.540
to shelter that wasn't smoky and by golly somebody invented chimney they wanted a house

29:21.540 --> 29:29.440
that would be warm in the winter and they developed insulation and eventually furnaces

29:29.440 --> 29:35.860
they dreamed of being cool in the summer and by golly along came air conditioning and

29:35.860 --> 29:43.300
things like this the dreams of any people at any particular time in history become the

29:43.300 --> 29:51.220
realities of future generation now how far down the line you don't know at all but essentially

29:51.740 --> 29:57.660
so far with the human race just about anything that can be dreamed of has been gained essentially

29:59.460 --> 30:04.860
about the only thing there's a tendency to respond to what I say this sort of things

30:04.860 --> 30:10.020
with platform people well during the question and answer period they'll hold up their hands

30:10.020 --> 30:16.060
and say but how about the dream of universal peace and I say well now you're not dealing

30:16.680 --> 30:23.040
you can deal with you can achieve universal peace very well with yourself when you're

30:23.040 --> 30:27.980
trying to achieve it with somebody else now that's another kettle of fish entirely you

30:27.980 --> 30:33.240
have counter purposes going back and forth but things that can be done man against his

30:33.240 --> 30:40.260
own universe man against his own environment is a battle with so far we tend to win and

30:41.140 --> 30:46.600
we're also beginning to win again in this last thousand years and this is one of the

30:46.600 --> 30:51.980
things we're a part way toward developing now the battle of man against himself in other

30:51.980 --> 30:58.920
words we're beginning to say to ourselves I don't want to be fat you know I don't want

30:58.920 --> 31:06.660
to be unhappy I don't want to be depressed and we're beginning to fumble out ways of

31:06.660 --> 31:15.440
doing something about that and depression and so on so far just as we're beginning to

31:15.440 --> 31:22.320
fumble toward an answer to the question of universal hunger you know the fact that some

31:22.320 --> 31:25.740
people are always going to lack this or lack that.

31:28.660 --> 31:37.160
Okay that's good okay I can I just have about two more now I know I know you were very hard

31:37.160 --> 31:41.000
at this but as long as you've written now how hard is it for you to write do you have

31:41.000 --> 31:42.460
to put a lot of work into it?

31:42.780 --> 31:52.540
Oh the writing any kind any any art requires an infinite amount of work you know who wasn't

31:52.540 --> 32:02.020
said that the definition of art was the taking of infinite things or words that affect but

32:02.020 --> 32:09.960
the point is the person doing it enjoys it or he doesn't do it I'm I'm fascinated with

32:09.960 --> 32:10.660
the work I do.

32:14.500 --> 32:21.860
You wonder for example how a concert pianist can practice five hours a day you know week

32:21.860 --> 32:29.880
after week month after month year after year you think if you're a non-piano player or

32:29.880 --> 32:33.760
if you had piano playing lessons pushed on you and didn't like them when you were young

32:33.760 --> 32:40.800
you think but this must be this must be a self-imposed agony it is it's a sheer pleasure

32:40.800 --> 32:46.500
for him to get things just right and this of course is the battle cry of the artist

32:46.500 --> 32:48.000
to get things just right.

32:49.680 --> 33:01.500
I write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite again this last book sections of it were written

33:01.500 --> 33:08.140
once and barely touched again other sections were written in noble times I really couldn't

33:08.140 --> 33:13.060
tell you how many ten or more ten fifteen times to get it just right.

33:14.520 --> 33:21.000
I can't reread anything I've written without picking up a pencil and starting to correct

33:21.000 --> 33:26.700
and improve it it's instinctive most writers have this kind of reaction to a certain extent

33:26.700 --> 33:32.660
although some rewrite more some rewrite less there is a type of writer that doesn't rewrite

33:32.660 --> 33:39.560
but instead sits and does nothing for a long time and then sits down and does it just the

33:39.560 --> 33:44.220
way he or she wants it and that possibly is the hardest work of all because it's all being

33:44.220 --> 33:44.900
done in the end.

33:45.680 --> 33:53.220
I do it on paper of course the fact that I use I use a computer to write with nowadays

33:53.220 --> 33:55.740
makes it that much easier makes it that much faster.

33:59.020 --> 34:03.360
Okay finally I want to make sure I have this straight now because I've read some differing

34:04.000 --> 34:05.980
statements from critics on your child cycle.

34:06.660 --> 34:10.060
Okay when it's finished there will be twelve novels is that right?

34:10.940 --> 34:18.860
Let's see now yes the original plan was for six novels.

34:25.160 --> 34:32.000
Let me see no for nine novels pardon me three historical three late in the 20th century

34:32.000 --> 34:39.340
and three late in the future because I started on the future length first it was there I

34:39.340 --> 34:45.220
first discovered that these that each book was was going to be too big to get into one

34:46.400 --> 34:53.320
one set of covers also to begin with with Dorsay and Soldier Astronaut and Necromancer

34:53.320 --> 34:58.640
and things like that I was up against the fact that publishers refused to print category

34:58.640 --> 35:03.580
fiction in lengths of much more than a hundred thousand words at that time.

35:04.500 --> 35:10.560
Remember this the first big book to come out actually was Frank Herbert's Dune which

35:10.560 --> 35:18.520
and it dates Dorsay which happened earlier about I think four or six years something

35:18.520 --> 35:29.300
like that and Dune was printed only because one editor in particular practically well

35:29.300 --> 35:34.840
ladies job online and practically offered to shoot up the publishing house at Leslie

35:34.840 --> 35:41.240
what after it and they choose their fingernails you know because there's a great deal of money

35:41.240 --> 35:43.080
involved in printing a very large book.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.020
This is still the case even with paperbacks even in paperback it's very expensive to do

35:50.020 --> 35:50.920
a big take book.

35:52.160 --> 35:57.620
So these things had to be cut pardon me I mean they had to be divided into smaller chunks

35:57.620 --> 36:03.620
and the result was I ended up with three historical three contemporary and six forward.

36:04.440 --> 36:15.800
Now I've got six forward final encyclopedia at fourteen hundred pages is so big that child

36:15.800 --> 36:20.000
which should have been see that final encyclopedia is a penultimate novel.

36:20.820 --> 36:26.940
The last one the ultimate one is child and obviously a final encyclopedia is fourteen hundred

36:26.940 --> 36:32.960
child would have run close to two thousand manuscript pages which is far too big so I've had to split that again.

36:33.760 --> 36:38.980
So effectively what we have now is not twelve but thirteen novels.

36:41.180 --> 36:47.320
Now I would like to say that this won't happen anymore that the three once I get through child

36:47.860 --> 36:52.460
three historical and three contemporary will will stay within single volume sizes.

36:53.020 --> 36:56.140
I think there's a pretty good chance except in the case of Hawkwood.

36:56.360 --> 37:03.960
Now and the problem with that is that is that Sir John Hawkwood the real the actual man lived a very long time

37:03.960 --> 37:10.840
by medieval standards and astonishingly long time when you just stop to think that most of his adult life was spent

37:11.620 --> 37:14.520
in hand-to-hand combat wearing armor.

37:18.520 --> 37:26.260
He actually lived into his seventies and he covered in that time what by modern standards would have been three

37:26.260 --> 37:27.080
or four lifetimes.

37:27.520 --> 37:35.220
He starts out in simple Headeham England which is out in the boondocks of ethics in his time literally

37:35.220 --> 37:43.140
when ethics was mainly for us and ends up in Florence Italy which at that time was the center of western civilization.

37:44.660 --> 37:55.760
So effectively he traveled in subjective time about 150 to 180 years in terms of moving forward with the pattern of civilization.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.280
Excuse me time out.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.060
I'm back with you.

38:07.980 --> 38:08.520
Sure.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.100
Sure.

38:11.800 --> 38:12.180
Okay.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.420
What else do you got for me?

38:15.460 --> 38:19.080
Well okay I guess I do have one more that was about it but let me ask you one more.

38:19.280 --> 38:23.480
This is something we like to ask most authors who have been written who have written as long as you have.

38:24.280 --> 38:29.260
As you look around the field now is it essentially different than it was when you started writing?

38:29.900 --> 38:32.340
Oh yes you know it's a great deal different.

38:33.240 --> 38:38.760
But the difference is one of natural evolution and development.

38:40.520 --> 38:47.280
In other words it's not that you see there was no point at which science fiction stood still.

38:48.660 --> 38:59.980
If you look at the magazines of the late 1920s which is when Hugo Gernsback was essentially starting the field in its modern sense.

39:00.680 --> 39:11.180
You could trace science fiction if you liked back to the Athenian Greek in the sense of stories about other worlds and other places.

39:13.960 --> 39:17.560
The concept of Atlantis goes back that far for example.

39:18.460 --> 39:24.640
So I know the Bergerac and I'm talking about the actual man not the character in the play.

39:28.080 --> 39:33.340
Wrote several stories one of them called Voyages to the Sun and the Moon.

39:37.260 --> 39:44.520
In other words it's a story type that runs down through history although it's rarer.

39:45.280 --> 39:55.720
It became a school essentially a category in publishers term in the 1920s when magazines began to devote themselves.

39:56.160 --> 40:02.180
This was the heyday of the magazines and they were racing magazines and western magazines and they were science fiction magazines.

40:02.980 --> 40:04.860
Magazines of fantastic science.

40:08.300 --> 40:19.640
What was printed in the late 1920s and the early 1930s went through a period of development when John Gamble took over Astounding.

40:20.360 --> 40:30.220
The concept of the hard science fiction story and also something else the idea story which is essentially a thematic science fiction story.

40:32.040 --> 40:39.020
It began with John in the 30s and that period has developed and gone on.

40:39.200 --> 40:42.800
They were originally hardware stories originally science fiction.

40:44.740 --> 40:48.060
It's gone from hard science to essentially soft science.

40:48.060 --> 41:04.420
In other words the subject the scientific element has gone from physics and chemistry to rather went from physics and chemistry into psychology and sociology and things like this.

41:05.700 --> 41:13.560
And with the emergence in the 60s of the excellent crop of women writers who have almost nominated the field since then.

41:14.940 --> 41:18.080
We've had the introduction of character into our stories.

41:19.360 --> 41:24.560
They have become much more stories of human interest.

41:26.860 --> 41:34.260
As has been pointed out it says that we've been exploring the inner universe as much as we've been exploring the outer universe perhaps more.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.420
Now this is a great development actually.

41:38.420 --> 41:41.040
Any literary field that doesn't develop dies.

41:41.280 --> 41:47.280
You can see if you look at the mystery field which has a category that goes back farther than science fiction.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.260
How the recognize category goes back farther than science fiction.

41:50.460 --> 41:59.980
Right into the 19th century you can see the development there the same way from the deductive mystery you should go back home type on up to the present day.

41:59.980 --> 42:09.680
The spy story like the Lee Curry stories you know the last one of which was Splyly's.

42:10.940 --> 42:11.720
Can't remember.

42:13.020 --> 42:23.060
But anyway the type of there's the action mystery and there's the spy mystery and so on and so forth.

42:25.900 --> 42:34.080
These periods of development I mean pardon me of these periods of development but this constant Russian development goes on all the time.

42:34.660 --> 42:37.180
And of course it's had its effect on science fiction.

42:37.900 --> 42:50.540
We have we have writers nowadays who were much more interested in the effect of future happenings upon people and on upon future happenings.

42:50.540 --> 42:56.780
So this this makes for very interesting very interesting fiction.

42:57.800 --> 43:02.280
And it's a curious field and that the older writers learn from the younger writers.

43:02.480 --> 43:07.900
In other words we shift to we were writing earlier and writing earlier type of science fiction.

43:09.060 --> 43:12.540
Learn and develop along with the field itself.

43:12.540 --> 43:19.120
So that the useful and elements that come in later on are picked up and shown in their own work as well.

43:22.420 --> 43:30.100
The one thing that doesn't change is the emphasis on exploration.

43:31.280 --> 43:41.280
Science fiction is one field that has a readership that will allow you to take that will allow the author to take a look at anything to explore any topic.

43:42.540 --> 43:46.120
And because of this it is very wholesome and very honest.

43:47.020 --> 43:59.240
This is one reason for example what the women the whole women the whole point of the women's the whole element of the women's movement came up in literature.

43:59.560 --> 44:02.460
It was the sort of thing that science fiction could not ignore.

44:03.440 --> 44:10.340
If you see something happening a change happening in your own lifetime and you're writing about the future you have to assume that

44:10.340 --> 44:15.180
there will be future effect from this happening.

44:15.500 --> 44:16.680
Excuse me time out again.

44:25.100 --> 44:27.440
I'm afraid my voice is going out for good here.

44:28.140 --> 44:32.480
Yeah well we're you know that's fine Mr. Dixon we've we've really got enough material.

44:34.560 --> 44:41.520
Yeah I will have more to say I hope I am not this croaky when I get down to University Kansas.

44:41.980 --> 44:46.000
Yeah we're almost approaching an hour so you put a lot of talking in.

44:47.940 --> 44:55.480
Well listen then we sure appreciate the time what we'll do is it probably is going to be called sometime before these are edited and sent to you.

44:55.680 --> 44:55.920
Right.

44:56.180 --> 44:59.500
But I will meet you in Kansas this summer I'm looking forward to that.

44:59.920 --> 45:00.280
Okay.

45:00.280 --> 45:03.560
And listen we very much appreciate your time we know how busy you are.

45:03.800 --> 45:16.080
Oh that's it's like life picks you up by the strut of the neck and carries you along as you're going to you will find yourself in doing the same thing you know in a while.

45:17.080 --> 45:24.360
Not only you not only get busier as you go along but the world itself gets busier around you.

45:24.780 --> 45:26.660
Got those what's going to happen in the lower right.

45:27.040 --> 45:29.320
That's the way it seems I wonder if it's really that way though.

45:29.320 --> 45:32.580
Oh yeah it is it is.

45:34.480 --> 45:46.720
We have a there's a number of factors that have their effect here one is simply that the world's population is increasing and if you look closely at it you'll see this increases competition.

45:47.560 --> 45:54.500
There are much more whatever whatever your level of competence is there's more people at that level in a position to compete with you.

45:56.640 --> 46:18.500
Also we have tools of proliferate tools everything from the dog on a hammer to the dog on computer itself and we're in a situation since we live in the competitive society in which the more tools you can handle the better position you are in that competition.

46:18.500 --> 46:40.580
It makes life easier more pleasant and far more interesting to be able to be able to use these tools and the tools can be a knowledge of foreign languages or it can be as I say a knowledge of how to program a computer or a knowledge of space mechanics for that matter.

46:42.020 --> 46:46.480
These things become fascinating particularly the people who are interested in life in general.

46:48.440 --> 46:54.840
Yeah I am I'm a medievalist myself I've got to get busy here and teach Chaucer in about half an hour I'm an English teacher here at the college.

46:56.660 --> 47:00.100
Chaucer was one of my favorites in fact Chaucer is contemporary with Hogwood.

47:00.800 --> 47:01.740
Oh yeah I'm sure they.

47:03.300 --> 47:16.880
Since Chaucer was used as you probably know on a number of confidential diplomatic sent on confidential diplomatic journeys by the king a great deal.

47:17.880 --> 47:20.820
The chances that he and Hogwood met are pretty dog gone good.

47:22.820 --> 47:30.560
Yeah okay I'll be looking forward to those future novels listen Mr. Dixon we sure appreciate the time and I'll be seeing you in a few weeks in Kansas and meet you in person.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.480
Thank you very much then.

47:32.720 --> 47:32.860
Right.

47:33.220 --> 47:33.820
Okay good bye.
