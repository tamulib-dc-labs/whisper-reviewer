00:01.720 --> 00:02.920
This is David Cruz.

00:03.240 --> 00:03.920
Daryl Lane.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.380
Not all of it.

00:06.060 --> 00:10.220
I've read Conan the Conqueror, and I've read most of the other things, but I have read

00:10.220 --> 00:14.220
all those pastiches, and I've read that AC-11 series, and I've read all of it.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.020
Have read the canvass?

00:15.680 --> 00:16.520
I've read some of them.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.620
That might be his best.

00:19.760 --> 00:20.100
It might be.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.140
Mickey's a much-mongered, shade person.

00:25.820 --> 00:26.420
Howard Woods.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.940
I've read more of it than Charlotte has.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.340
I've read things besides the Conan stuff.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.540
I'll have to say with a short story.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.640
Well, first one I ever read was the Valley of the Worm.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.180
Yeah.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.980
Didn't he think his westerns would be what he was remembered for?

00:55.080 --> 00:56.340
He would be his best.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.780
He was turning towards westerns when he died.

00:59.380 --> 01:02.340
That he said he was going to start riding westerns during entirely.

01:02.520 --> 01:02.880
Yeah.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.820
We're going to catch the noise outside, but let's just lie.

01:08.940 --> 01:12.520
Well, I could close those blackout curtains if you think so.

01:12.620 --> 01:13.420
That might help a little.

01:18.420 --> 01:19.680
Daryl, speak to me for a second.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.160
Testing, one, two, three, four.

01:22.340 --> 01:23.540
Testing, that's too close, isn't it?

01:23.600 --> 01:23.820
Right here?

01:24.200 --> 01:25.500
No, no, no, no, but at some playback.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.080
Yeah, but right here is where you want me to speak.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.780
We'll see your levels right here.

01:29.980 --> 01:30.380
Go ahead and talk.

01:30.740 --> 01:31.960
Testing, one, two, three, four.

01:33.660 --> 01:33.940
Yeah.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.300
Yeah, I think they cut down on the noise.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.040
This would be the first full-length book on Howard Wright, biography type.

01:40.580 --> 01:42.220
Yes, the last kill because they only thought.

01:42.540 --> 01:43.000
Okay, hang on.

01:43.100 --> 01:43.780
We're not, okay.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.320
Yeah, and that wasn't really a...

01:45.320 --> 01:45.860
Bill talked to me for a second.

01:45.860 --> 01:46.420
It's a vowel, baby.

01:46.600 --> 01:46.800
Yeah.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.720
Okay, how's that?

01:48.600 --> 01:49.080
All right.

01:49.180 --> 01:49.940
The cam is done.

01:50.460 --> 01:53.160
Louder, or slower, slower, closer.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.900
Which is a biographical.

01:55.340 --> 01:56.660
But it's only about 50 pages.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.440
Yeah, I'm not familiar with that one, I guess.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.640
It looks about like a magazine.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.200
Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.860
He did the all-time back.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.120
Okay, two, three.

02:07.420 --> 02:08.320
He was the publisher.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.060
But this would be the first full-length.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.940
I guess you can't find it.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.160
Well, I guess it could be.

02:15.160 --> 02:15.500
Okay.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.000
He's a pro-chair over here.

02:17.140 --> 02:18.160
He could talk into it.

02:18.240 --> 02:18.860
She's like...

02:19.820 --> 02:20.460
Mike Fry.

02:20.580 --> 02:21.780
As I said, don't worry, we edit this.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.020
You know, you ought to see after we do a show, tell jokes and laugh and everything else.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.520
He edited some out.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.040
Okay.

02:30.080 --> 02:30.820
Am I coming across?

02:31.480 --> 02:33.240
Definitely, but Lou, you're out there.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.280
Uh-oh, sorry.

02:34.640 --> 02:35.380
I got it.

02:36.160 --> 02:36.440
There.

02:40.020 --> 02:40.720
Okay, Darryl.

02:41.220 --> 02:42.000
Are we on right now?

02:42.280 --> 02:42.720
We're going.

02:43.000 --> 02:43.420
Oh, okay.

02:45.200 --> 02:50.420
We'd like to know some things, Dr. Loughlin, about the camp's forthcoming biography of Howard.

02:50.660 --> 02:54.700
For instance, how you became associated with the camp and if you're helping with the book

02:54.700 --> 02:56.000
and data publication, anything?

02:56.840 --> 03:00.020
Okay, well, I am helping very in a minor capacity.

03:00.900 --> 03:05.680
He came to Brownwood in 1978 to do research for the book, and I met him then, and I have

03:05.680 --> 03:09.580
looked up several things for him at the Beard County Courthouse about Howard's insurance

03:09.580 --> 03:14.240
policy that was left to his mother about his car, about what his estate was.

03:15.060 --> 03:16.760
I've looked up a lot of things at Brownwood High.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.520
His grade report from Howard Payne Business College.

03:22.180 --> 03:24.300
Just a few things like that is the way I've helped him.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.960
Well, what have you seen of the book so far?

03:28.020 --> 03:29.420
What kind of approach does he seem to take?

03:29.660 --> 03:31.840
Is it a literary criticism or a biography?

03:32.400 --> 03:35.660
The idea for the book actually came from a woman named Jane Griffith.

03:36.700 --> 03:41.240
She's dead now, but she was a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, I believe.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.300
They're in Philadelphia in the area where they live.

03:44.220 --> 03:48.500
She suggested, well, actually they were talking about the trouble they were having over a

03:48.500 --> 03:53.680
Conan copyright, and they were mentioning the Kirkendall women, and not that they were

03:53.680 --> 03:55.860
giving them problems, but they just mentioned the name.

03:56.500 --> 04:01.120
This Jane Griffith, who was a friend of theirs, said, well, I know some Kirkendalls, and she

04:01.120 --> 04:01.500
said, really?

04:01.700 --> 04:02.500
Where are they from?

04:02.500 --> 04:05.420
She said, Ranger Texas, and they just came and glued.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.340
They said, these are our ladies.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.180
What do you know about them?

04:09.540 --> 04:13.840
She said she'd gone to high school with the daughter of Dr. Kirkendall.

04:15.980 --> 04:19.060
Jane suggested that they write a psychobiography.

04:19.700 --> 04:20.720
That is the approach.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.240
It's very heavy, psychological.

04:25.020 --> 04:27.780
The second chapter, I believe, is titled Dark Valley Lord.

04:27.780 --> 04:32.780
This is about his father's influence in the young boy's life and how he could have been

04:32.780 --> 04:38.180
a symbol of the dark valley lord, which would not account for some of the very emotional

04:38.180 --> 04:40.600
storming relationship he had with his father.

04:41.440 --> 04:48.960
In other words, the attempt to explain maybe why he wrote the kind of fiction he did because

04:48.960 --> 04:50.980
of the upbringing and the life that he had?

04:51.040 --> 04:55.420
Actually, the approach that Jane Griffith had in mind was to explain why he committed

04:55.420 --> 04:56.620
suicide when he did.

04:56.620 --> 05:00.480
She was interested in it from a psychologist's point of view, and that a cancer worker

05:00.480 --> 05:02.120
interested in it from a literary point of view.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.780
What does his psychology tell us about what he wrote?

05:05.200 --> 05:07.440
They used psychology that way.

05:07.980 --> 05:13.740
Then Jane Griffith died several months ago, and she'd only done the first six chapters

05:13.740 --> 05:14.140
with them.

05:14.240 --> 05:18.040
The last half is going to be done totally without her input, even though she'd done a

05:18.040 --> 05:20.840
lot of research and work on it and commentary for them.

05:21.360 --> 05:26.180
I think it's going to be a little less of a psycho biography than it started out to be.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.700
I'm picking up some peas.

05:30.840 --> 05:31.380
It's okay.

05:31.820 --> 05:32.460
We all got them.

05:33.820 --> 05:36.680
Is the camp comfortable with that approach to Howard?

05:36.780 --> 05:42.240
I remember once in one of his earlier articles about Howard, he said that it wasn't up to

05:42.240 --> 05:47.600
him to psychoanalyze and far be it from him to explain Howard's work or to look at his

05:47.600 --> 05:47.940
life.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.800
Getting involved with a book like this now, is that?

05:51.540 --> 05:53.980
I really feel that he's fairly comfortable with it.

05:54.020 --> 05:59.660
If you read Lovecraft's biography by the camp, he uses a lot of psychology in that, too.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.120
In fact, many of the fans were infuriated.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.960
They thought he was a little bit heavy-handed on the psychology.

06:05.700 --> 06:10.940
In the literary swordsmen and sorcerers, in which he has a chapter on Howard, he uses

06:10.940 --> 06:15.640
the word schizoid to describe him.

06:15.860 --> 06:20.900
He goes to great length to explain that this is not the same meaning as schizophrenic, but

06:20.900 --> 06:24.620
that word has offended people like Lindsay Tyson and Tevis Clydesmith.

06:25.220 --> 06:27.460
Their approach is whether he's calling him crazy.

06:28.140 --> 06:32.900
I think, really, the camp is more inclined towards psychological criticism than that

06:32.900 --> 06:34.740
comment you read would indicate.

06:38.380 --> 06:44.880
Do you think that Howard had serious psychological problems or the kinds of?

06:45.240 --> 06:46.960
I don't think there's any doubt that he did.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.660
Is it as simple as a domineering father and a possessive mother?

06:52.120 --> 06:55.200
Well, I don't know if it'd be that simple or not, but certainly those were contributing

06:56.200 --> 06:56.640
problems.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.400
The father was not really so domineering.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.320
He was as possessive as the mother was.

07:02.160 --> 07:07.400
Everyone blames her, but he was terribly upset when a girl would come by to see Robert.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.220
You know, and say, oh, mama, does this mean we're going to lose our boy?

07:10.460 --> 07:12.640
No, and she'd say, we're not going to lose our boy.

07:13.020 --> 07:14.820
She was more confident.

07:16.640 --> 07:20.300
They had a very emotional relationship with Howard and his father.

07:20.900 --> 07:26.760
They would have these stormy scenes and then these very emotional reconciliation with each other.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.760
So there was definitely family problems there of some sort.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.580
I don't guess any psychological problems is simple.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.640
He was born a little bit late in life, our first child.

07:39.420 --> 07:43.040
His mother was 35, 36, I think, was born.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.760
They had considered adopting a child before he was born.

07:49.100 --> 07:53.760
Perhaps he was just, I've seen a picture of him when he was four years old with the long curls.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.220
You can just tell that he was his mother's pride and joy.

07:56.780 --> 07:57.580
He was an only child?

07:57.940 --> 07:58.180
Yes.

08:01.680 --> 08:07.120
I understand that he did, what, have suicidal thoughts or...

08:07.120 --> 08:07.780
All his life.

08:07.900 --> 08:08.300
Oh, he did.

08:08.660 --> 08:12.040
At least as early as high school he was talking about suicide.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.580
Now, Lindsey Tyson says that he never mentioned suicide to him,

08:15.980 --> 08:21.300
but Howard kept his friendship with Tyson separate from his literary associations.

08:22.020 --> 08:26.200
He would go hunting with Lindsey Tyson or they didn't actually shoot anything.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.600
He just went trapping around with a gun in their hands.

08:29.260 --> 08:34.920
But that's why Lindsey Tyson did not hesitate to loan him the gun that Howard shot himself with.

08:35.580 --> 08:39.480
Howard had his own gun while he borrowed friends to shoot himself with, no one ever knew.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.080
Yeah, I understood that it was the gun that he'd carry with him in his car.

08:45.500 --> 08:49.400
It was in the glove compartment of his car, but it was Lindsey Tyson's gun.

08:50.540 --> 08:54.400
In fact, I said no one knew why he borrowed a friend's gun,

08:54.540 --> 08:58.180
but people have speculated that his father knew he was considering suicide

08:58.180 --> 09:02.000
because he had said things to his father like, are you going to go with us?

09:03.080 --> 09:07.120
Daddy, you know, us, that he was going to go when the mother went.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.700
They knew she was in her terminal illness.

09:10.420 --> 09:16.860
And they speculated perhaps Dr. Howard had hidden his handguns with, you know,

09:17.420 --> 09:20.840
that's just speculation, but he did borrow it from his friend Lindsey Tyson.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.580
You might back up and explain who Lindsey Tyson is.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.420
Okay, Lindsey Tyson is a resident of Cross Plains.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.300
He lives there today.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.480
He was a close friend of Howard.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.580
They met in junior high, I believe.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.620
Howard came out for basketball.

09:37.380 --> 09:41.840
He was so domineering, I guess is the word.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.500
He didn't want like team play.

09:43.720 --> 09:44.960
He was not good at team sports.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.940
He just wanted to rush in there and get the ball himself.

09:47.140 --> 09:50.380
And consequently, he had a little trouble with the coach and the other players.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.860
So he felt like he had been rejected.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.340
He was an outcast.

09:55.460 --> 10:01.060
And Lindsey Tyson was one of his friends, one of the few friends he had really in junior high in high school.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.620
And they were close off their adult lives.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.400
In fact, Howard would not even walk on anyone else's property.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.760
And you know, out in the country, a small town, when you're walking in the town,

10:10.800 --> 10:13.520
you could cross anybody's past or yard you want to.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.700
He wouldn't walk on anyone else's property except Lindsey Tyson's.

10:17.060 --> 10:18.980
He would walk across his farm, but no one else's.

10:19.300 --> 10:26.040
They say sometimes he would walk miles out of his way to walk, you know, to go by the road rather than to take a shortcut across somebody's pasture.

10:28.220 --> 10:29.780
I had one more question about his mother.

10:32.480 --> 10:38.160
It seems to be the immediate impetus for his suicide was his mother's pending death, I guess.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.480
Didn't the nurse tell him that she wouldn't come out of the coma or something of that effect?

10:42.940 --> 10:46.300
Was that the reason or does this have a longer history?

10:46.500 --> 10:48.080
I mean, was it simply the last straw?

10:48.260 --> 10:50.040
I think it's a longer history.

10:50.200 --> 10:54.520
I think he couldn't function in a world without his devotion to his mother.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.060
He didn't have any purpose in life.

10:56.620 --> 11:04.900
Jane Griffin, the psychologist, has speculated that because of the worry with his mother's last illness that he couldn't ride either.

11:05.160 --> 11:09.300
So he didn't have riding as a release for his emotions.

11:09.300 --> 11:13.100
And all of his emotions have been released through his riding or through his mother.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.500
And not having her, he just couldn't function anymore.

11:16.580 --> 11:20.820
But it's a lifetime, 30 years of not functioning without your mother.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.480
So that's a possibility.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.480
What is the inscription on the tombstone, say?

11:28.600 --> 11:31.760
They were beautiful in life and they're not separated in death.

11:31.960 --> 11:36.080
Something like that is from Wordsworth that Dr. Heidel picked it out.

11:36.080 --> 11:40.260
He chose it. They're beautiful together in life and they're not separated in death.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.680
When did Dr. Howard die, his father?

11:42.400 --> 11:46.100
I want to say 1948, but that may be too late. It was in the 40s.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.300
That was what, some 20, over 20 years later, in fact, he lived on then, right?

11:49.660 --> 11:50.160
Or no, I'm sorry.

11:50.320 --> 11:50.640
That may be.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.320
No, no, he died in, Howard in 36.

11:52.680 --> 11:52.880
36.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.620
So that may be sometime in the 40s, I would have to check.

11:56.860 --> 11:57.040
Yeah.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.280
Yeah, the psychology of Howard, of course, is fascinating.

12:00.420 --> 12:04.000
I assume that's why, you know, why this book is taking the approach it is.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.820
But Dr. Kreider, what, I suppose any author would put himself into his work,

12:09.900 --> 12:12.500
whether he wants to or not, you know, you can't hardly help that.

12:14.780 --> 12:19.520
How much of Howard do you think came out in his heroes, Conan or Brandt Moore or any of them?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.600
I probably shouldn't even speculate about that.

12:22.900 --> 12:31.300
But Howard, there are all the stories about Howard walking down the street and doing the shadow boxing

12:31.300 --> 12:34.620
and fencing, things like that.

12:35.060 --> 12:42.080
And I would assume, probably incorrectly, but I would assume that there was probably a lot of him in Conan

12:42.700 --> 12:45.480
and some of the other heroes or at least.

12:45.540 --> 12:46.720
I think that it was a wishful feeling.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.440
Right, he liked to think that there was a lot of him in those heroes.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.560
But he would have been had he not been so psychologically crippled.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.740
Well, didn't he actually believe, how, I'm not sure if he believed this or not,

12:59.740 --> 13:03.880
but didn't he often write that sometimes when he was writing, it was like he was being possessed by

13:03.880 --> 13:07.080
by heroes or forces or things from the past?

13:07.340 --> 13:12.000
Maybe lived these past lives that he dreamed these past lives.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.420
I don't believe he ever said he was possessed.

13:14.660 --> 13:18.860
He didn't use that one, but he said it was as though Conan were standing at his shoulder,

13:18.860 --> 13:20.960
there beside him.

13:25.020 --> 13:30.080
And his philosophy of which story is it is it beyond the Black River?

13:30.360 --> 13:33.240
Is that the one where he talks about barbarism at the end?

13:35.060 --> 13:36.200
He talked about that quite a bit.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.500
I'm not talking about how the barbarians will prevail.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.680
Hmm. One tends to get the feeling of that in a lot of his books.

13:45.180 --> 13:49.320
The specific statement of it is in one story that I can't particularly remember,

13:49.320 --> 13:54.820
but I've often wondered whether Howard believed that himself or not,

13:55.280 --> 13:57.440
whether he liked to think that that was true.

13:57.680 --> 14:02.560
I think that again, it was a sort of explanation for why he did not fit in with other people.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.460
He liked to believe I am the last barbarian.

14:05.860 --> 14:12.780
It's because in my time, who will prevail, he liked to believe the other people had a veneer of civilization on them

14:12.780 --> 14:15.700
that got them away from the basics that were really important.

14:15.700 --> 14:26.080
And if you've read his correspondence with Lovecraft, they had long arguments about the physical versus the intellectual needs of a society.

14:26.740 --> 14:31.280
And Howard would say that in the tough country where he lived, you had to be physically fit,

14:31.440 --> 14:37.840
and he spent a great deal of his life, his adult life, trying to be physically fit, boxing and working out.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.580
That's the whole thing.

14:40.320 --> 14:52.540
But I think it's more of an excuse that these other people have intellectualized or have adopted some kind of pansy religion or something like that.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.340
And I'm not. I'm one of the originals in my time to survive.

14:57.240 --> 15:00.300
What do you think about some reasons why Howard wrote?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.520
I read contradictory things on this.

15:02.620 --> 15:06.120
For instance, once he said, I do it for the money. If it wasn't for the money, I wouldn't write.

15:07.000 --> 15:14.820
In other places, he said, well, as we've been saying just a few moments ago, he seemed to have a need to write.

15:16.780 --> 15:24.820
What do you think of his actual motives? Was he clear on them? Did he have a sense of himself as doing a useful job of writing, or was it just for the money?

15:25.640 --> 15:32.040
I don't see how it could have been for the money considering what he was paid for some of the things that he wrote,

15:32.040 --> 15:34.900
especially when he first started out. He wasn't selling that much.

15:35.620 --> 15:45.100
Just some poems and short, very short stories to weird tales. He didn't get much, but he certainly didn't quit writing. He kept on.

15:45.960 --> 15:55.980
Pardon me. He also said when he was nine years old, he told the Postmistress, I want to say it was not Wanger Crosscut, I believe, when he was nine years old.

15:55.980 --> 16:03.740
He told the Postmistress that he was going to go up to be a writer and write stories about pirates. So he at least had the idea from the time he was nine years old.

16:03.940 --> 16:06.880
And certainly he was not thinking about money then.

16:10.780 --> 16:15.940
I knew that. Well, that's all you wanted to do? Yeah. Okay. I got one.

16:19.580 --> 16:21.940
When did Howard first start writing and get published?

16:22.520 --> 16:32.320
I believe his first publication that I know of was in the Brownwood High School newspaper. And some of those are running around town here somewhere, but I've never made eyes on them.

16:32.600 --> 16:37.740
I understand they had some of them on display at the 50 year reunion that would have been in 1973.

16:38.520 --> 16:41.340
What about his first national publications and weird tales?

16:42.280 --> 16:51.480
It was the first. Tavis Clyde Smith, he was going to Howard Payne at the time in business school and he was living in a house that's over by the,

16:52.860 --> 16:55.560
underpass, just about a block or two from where we are right now.

16:56.120 --> 17:04.260
And he got the acceptance and Tavis Clyde Smith said, I believe it was Lindsey Tyson who told me this, that he opened the letter.

17:04.420 --> 17:08.400
It was an acceptance that he had received many rejections from other magazines before.

17:08.940 --> 17:15.860
He said he fell down on his knees and thanked God that he had made this sale, jumped up and said, now it won't be so hard.

17:15.860 --> 17:19.980
Now that I'm finally broken in, I'll have a better chance at selling something over.

17:21.840 --> 17:29.540
Is it true that when he lived in cross planes, you know, the last, what, what, 10 years? How long was he in cross planes?

17:29.740 --> 17:31.560
I lived in cross planes when he, in his junior high.

17:31.760 --> 17:41.300
Oh, okay, that long. Okay. Well, when he was earning his money as a writer, say at the, oh, year two before his death, was he making, I read a statement, more money than anybody in cross planes?

17:41.480 --> 17:42.580
That's what Jack Scott says.

17:42.900 --> 17:43.520
You think that's true?

17:45.600 --> 17:47.760
For depression. Now this is depression days course.

17:48.120 --> 17:57.720
The story in Brownwood is that he was the only man either in Brown County or maybe just in cross planes who could afford to buy a new car and pay cash for it.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.160
And he was the only one who paid income tax one year.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.720
It was only one in cross planes who had to pay income tax.

18:02.860 --> 18:05.420
And when he died, he did have a car that was only one year old.

18:05.960 --> 18:10.880
It was a Chevrolet that was a year old and maybe not even quite a year.

18:10.880 --> 18:18.860
And he had paid cash for it and he did leave some money in the bank and he had a paid up insurance policy made out to his mother.

18:19.020 --> 18:20.720
She survived it by 11 days.

18:20.940 --> 18:28.540
So his father had to go through this legal rigmarole since his wife didn't leave a will so that he could collect this insurance policy.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.000
Was he helping to support his mother?

18:31.460 --> 18:32.460
Was there any kind of?

18:32.940 --> 18:35.840
Oh, I feel certain that, that he did.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.820
And at least he said so in his letters now again.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.760
Maybe he wanted to feel that he was necessary to his parents.

18:41.300 --> 18:48.740
His father was making enough money that he mentioned in his letters that the cost of medicine was so expensive and the things that they needed was very expensive.

18:50.800 --> 18:56.140
I'm kind of interested also in Howard's consciousness of himself as a writer.

18:59.000 --> 19:11.840
Did he think that he, in your opinions, of course, do you think that he thought of himself as a writer who would be remembered as anything more than a person simply making a living as an author?

19:11.920 --> 19:18.920
Didn't he have a consciousness of himself as possibly being remembered as a regional writer of the Southwest for some of his Western material?

19:18.920 --> 19:27.420
Or, I mean, you know, just his own attitude about himself as a creator, as an author who would be remembered.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.800
Any ideas about that?

19:30.460 --> 19:38.160
As far as I know, the only thing that I've even heard would be about the regional, the Southwestern material, some of the Western stories.

19:38.720 --> 19:46.460
I don't know that he ever thought that these other stories were that literary or maybe even that important.

19:46.460 --> 19:56.440
You know, he cannibalized some stories that he would write, set in one time frame, he would go back and rewrite them using other characters.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.260
Not that that would make any difference, I don't guess.

19:59.660 --> 20:05.060
But I think he did have a desire to be remembered. He wanted to be a great artist.

20:05.460 --> 20:08.600
And I think that's why he decided to do an epic of Southwest.

20:08.600 --> 20:27.060
That's what he told Lovecraft, he wanted to do. He wanted to do an epic of Texas and the Southwest and he wrote this long genealogical thing saying he had a feel for it because his people had been here and his grandfathers had been in the Confederacy and all this, that and the other of why he had this strong feeling for it.

20:27.320 --> 20:34.840
But I think he was looking for something. As you said, he knew that the stories he was writing at the time probably would not be remembered immortally.

20:34.840 --> 20:38.420
He would be quite surprised, I think, to find out Conan's popularity today.

20:39.020 --> 20:45.780
But he had a desire to be remembered and he was looking for a medium in which he would excel.

20:46.640 --> 20:57.380
I think it was Lovecraft, I know for Lovecraft for sure, but I think some others too who said that had he lived and had he continued to write that he would have written more regional, more Western stories, perhaps the epic of the Southwest.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.840
That's what DeKant thinks.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.980
Yeah, and DeKant thinks the same thing, that he would be remembered for that.

21:05.180 --> 21:11.960
Did he do any work in that direction beyond his Breckenridge, Pike Bearfield?

21:13.360 --> 21:21.960
Yeah, okay. Beyond the work that he had published in the field of the West, are there any notes that you know of or any kind of attempt to start an epic of the region?

21:21.960 --> 21:31.120
Not a start for epic, no. There were some fragments of other Western tales found in those two trolls and manuscripts that DeKant dug up.

21:34.720 --> 21:41.640
Dr. Kreider, we may have to cut this. I'm not sure I'm going the right direction here.

21:41.960 --> 21:42.500
Don't worry about it.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.820
Have you read any of his Western work?

21:45.540 --> 21:46.700
Only a few stories.

21:48.380 --> 21:51.960
I've heard DeKant read one that he thinks very highly of. I forgot.

21:52.120 --> 21:53.300
About shooting off the air.

21:53.500 --> 21:53.820
Right.

21:54.200 --> 21:58.280
Well, what I wanted to ask about that, I've read most of his Western work myself.

22:00.280 --> 22:06.380
People have said he had a feeling for the idiom of the West, the regionalisms, the atmosphere and so forth.

22:07.580 --> 22:09.320
But it was still, what I've read is still the pulp.

22:10.840 --> 22:15.520
What? The pulp environment, the pulp formulas for the stories.

22:15.520 --> 22:26.080
Do you think he, did he have his roots deeply enough or a feeling for the West deeply enough where he could have written a realistic kind of Western material?

22:26.500 --> 22:27.980
Could he have become the Louis Lemur?

22:28.500 --> 22:32.020
No, no, I mean more seriously. I mean a good but great literature.

22:32.260 --> 22:38.220
Did he have the talent or was he so imbued with the pulp environment that...

22:38.220 --> 22:42.840
He may have had the talent, but I certainly don't believe he was capable of writing realistic fiction.

22:42.840 --> 22:46.480
He was not that closely tied to reality himself.

22:47.040 --> 22:51.700
I don't believe he ever could have written realistic novels. He had derived fantasies of some sort.

22:52.620 --> 22:57.080
He may have had the talent, but I don't think he had the personal realism to do it.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.260
His Western material, most of it that I've read is humorous.

23:01.800 --> 23:02.520
Probably right.

23:02.620 --> 23:04.500
Right. I think that's what DeKant admires.

23:04.520 --> 23:04.840
Yes.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.620
It's the humorous aspect of it.

23:06.620 --> 23:15.860
And he seems to think that that might have been the direction he was going more to the humorous Western than the realistic Western.

23:15.940 --> 23:21.920
Of course we have to say a little bit of DeKant in that conclusion because DeKant writes humorous science fiction.

23:22.560 --> 23:26.980
And you tend to think, well he would have become more like me.

23:27.580 --> 23:32.120
And in fact it's DeKant's life-heartedness that some people can't forgive him for.

23:32.120 --> 23:39.620
They accuse him of making Conan into a huckish character, which was not really in Howard's original audience.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.720
Conan certainly wasn't very huckish. He wasn't very funny.

23:43.100 --> 23:53.120
Well at the risk of outraging all the Howard fans, and Charlotte keeps saying maybe he had the talent,

23:53.120 --> 24:04.320
but where is that really in evidence in the stories that we have of Robert E. Howard as a great writer or a great stylist or,

24:05.440 --> 24:08.380
I'm not sure that there's any evidence of that.

24:08.500 --> 24:15.940
I think he was a fine pulp writer, and I don't have anything bad to say about his pulp work,

24:15.940 --> 24:27.660
but I don't know that he would ever have broken out of that pulp ghetto and be accepted by what we might call the approved literature standards.

24:28.740 --> 24:32.400
Since he was writing for Money Towards the End, he definitely was.

24:33.040 --> 24:39.340
It would be very hard to break out of the pulp syndrome that he was in because he was having to write what people wanted to read.

24:39.480 --> 24:43.920
Now I think parts of Conan are fairly literary, but then you'll get to a fairly good point,

24:43.920 --> 24:46.600
and then he'll have another one of those wrestling matches with a giant snake,

24:47.140 --> 24:51.560
the same formulas that he's used in a dozen other places, and they get very old and very trite.

24:51.880 --> 24:58.180
But there are a paragraph or two at a time where it sounds as though he really did have a command of the language that I like.

24:58.300 --> 24:59.480
I like the sound of it.

25:00.020 --> 25:07.460
And also though he was interested in history and studied art and art, there are a lot of inaccuracies.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.680
Go ahead and back that up. He was interested in history.

25:09.680 --> 25:14.340
Although he was interested in history and studied it and had a lot of books in his collection,

25:15.180 --> 25:24.780
he can't find a number of anachronisms in some of the Conan manuscripts and even changed one or two of them in some of those pastiches that he did.

25:25.160 --> 25:31.280
Yes, I believe one was the stirrups that you mentioned that had him in stirrups before there were stirrups.

25:31.820 --> 25:37.680
But since this is a completely imaginary world and how boy in age had a way, we know they didn't have stirrups.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.860
Yeah, but I wonder whether he would have been a...

25:40.860 --> 25:42.680
You know, he's not...

25:47.220 --> 25:49.960
No, okay. You needed to lead in on something.

25:50.520 --> 25:51.560
I wasn't going to change the subject.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.680
Okay, we were talking about...

25:54.620 --> 25:54.800
Stirrups.

25:54.940 --> 25:57.280
Well, that would fit right in doing research, blah, blah, blah.

25:57.540 --> 26:03.860
She just mentioned that he wore stirrups and that was out of context.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.860
And you were just saying...

26:07.920 --> 26:13.580
I was just saying that I don't know if he had ever written westerns other than the humorous kind,

26:14.000 --> 26:20.160
whether he would have had the stamina or whatever is required to do accurate historical research.

26:20.560 --> 26:25.400
And it might be that he would just have relied on old family stories and things like that.

26:25.780 --> 26:33.200
Yeah, a lot of the books that I noticed in the library here at Howard Payne were the Lowell Thomas History Series,

26:33.200 --> 26:36.940
which is somewhat colorful and not exactly accurate.

26:40.140 --> 26:46.560
And Dr. Laughlin has the list of his books that we have, and we can confirm that.

26:47.320 --> 26:51.700
He did have, I'm sure, some more solid kinds of historical research,

26:51.800 --> 26:56.360
but I don't think that's what his personal taste was inclined to.

26:56.380 --> 27:01.340
I think he would have relied not even so much on family stories as he would have on his own reading.

27:01.820 --> 27:04.420
And he read things like Robert Service novels.

27:04.540 --> 27:08.140
He had that said one, two, three, four, five, six of those.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.380
Sorry, I was counting.

27:09.660 --> 27:10.440
Okay, wait, wait, okay.

27:10.580 --> 27:11.740
Mic up and talk about the Robert...

27:11.740 --> 27:13.040
He had...

27:13.040 --> 27:18.320
I was saying that I thought that Robert Howard not only would have relied upon family stories,

27:18.340 --> 27:22.500
but even more so he would have relied upon his own reading of fiction.

27:22.900 --> 27:25.440
And his taste in fiction doesn't seem to be too high.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.120
He read things like the Robert Service novels.

27:28.120 --> 27:33.620
We know that there were six Robert Service books in his personal library that his father donated to Howard Paine.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.300
Micah, what were the Robert Service novels?

27:36.300 --> 27:38.640
Well, he wrote several different kinds.

27:38.780 --> 27:39.860
He wrote Robert Service poetry.

27:40.620 --> 27:43.520
And Robert Service wrote poetry, but it was...

27:43.520 --> 27:44.520
I won't...

27:44.520 --> 27:45.640
How would you describe it, Bill?

27:46.240 --> 27:47.020
I haven't read them.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.020
Well, I read this kind of thing when I was growing up.

27:50.180 --> 27:51.720
They're very melodramatic.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.760
His war stories were very melodramatic.

27:54.760 --> 27:58.360
And you have this lone hero and he's so noble and so good.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.580
But I would not say that Robert Service writing is really realistic.

28:01.960 --> 28:05.880
He had a lot of sax-roamer books in his collection.

28:05.900 --> 28:12.060
Also, the Oriental, Exotic, Romantic type of thing.

28:12.900 --> 28:17.780
I just can't picture Howard as a realistic writer in any way.

28:18.340 --> 28:20.760
Well, he had to get almost all of his...

28:20.760 --> 28:22.660
What do you want to call it? Inspiration for his fiction?

28:22.840 --> 28:25.760
Buy his reading from his reading because it's sort of an...

28:25.760 --> 28:34.240
Another of DeKamp's points is that that's a weakness in Howard's work is that he never traveled to see these things.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.080
He never really got out of cross planes.

28:37.460 --> 28:39.600
He did a little, but not much.

28:39.780 --> 28:44.720
In fact, some of the incidents in his novels you can find in other novels that he had read.

28:44.860 --> 28:47.100
And I'm sorry, I can't remember the specific examples.

28:47.100 --> 28:51.160
We do know that, I believe it was Simeron by Edna Farber.

28:51.520 --> 28:56.540
He told Lovecraft, he wrote Lovecraft, that this incident had really happened in cross planes.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.240
And it was an incident in Simeron.

29:01.580 --> 29:04.320
Well, Howard relied heavily on the reading that he did.

29:05.860 --> 29:06.380
Is that okay?

29:07.720 --> 29:11.000
He relied so heavily on it that in his letters he actually...

29:11.000 --> 29:12.200
No, wait a minute. Go ahead and start again.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.520
I have to have room to edit the clicks and stuff out.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.820
Howard relied heavily on the reading that he did.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.440
He relied on it for his fiction.

29:21.640 --> 29:25.240
Also, he claimed that some of the incidents actually happened in his own life.

29:25.640 --> 29:32.580
He wrote Lovecraft, that an incident in which something was blown up in an oil field.

29:33.180 --> 29:37.020
I can't remember exactly what it was, and that you had to be in great physical shape

29:37.020 --> 29:42.120
because this man was able to catch it in his arms and run with it to save the lives of all of these people.

29:42.120 --> 29:45.160
But the incident did not happen in cross planes.

29:45.320 --> 29:49.880
It happened in the novel Simeron, which was in his personal library, which was done in Tyler Penn.

29:50.660 --> 29:58.520
So he had such a slight grasp of the reality or such slight experience in the world

29:58.520 --> 30:03.180
that he actually had to claim things from novels to have been in his experience

30:03.180 --> 30:05.060
to have things to write about to people.

30:06.660 --> 30:11.420
Who are some of the other authors that he would have had in his library that he liked to read?

30:11.420 --> 30:13.640
So, you know, the writer, the creator's of fiction.

30:13.740 --> 30:16.340
I had about six Conan Doll books.

30:17.360 --> 30:25.040
I was wondering how much influence the Conan series and Brian McMoron and all the barbarian type series had

30:25.040 --> 30:29.960
from Egyrace Burrow's books that I noticed he had a few of those.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.840
Well, I'm really not qualified to tell you that.

30:34.020 --> 30:36.440
He had one that I say, the Beast of Tarzan.

30:38.020 --> 30:42.620
Well, Tarzan and Conan are similar enough.

30:43.400 --> 30:48.000
Outcasts. I mean, they don't actually fit in with the fun of the male type of person, I mean.

30:48.460 --> 30:49.960
Which is what Howard wanted to be.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.500
Away from civilization. Superman, sort of.

30:55.060 --> 30:58.480
Isn't it sort of strange? This is sort of a summation, I think, of what we've been saying.

30:59.340 --> 31:02.940
To have a writer of fantasy, particularly the kind that Howard wrote,

31:03.680 --> 31:07.240
which I associate mostly with the northern environment, I suppose.

31:07.960 --> 31:12.100
Coming from the Southwest, from such an arid landscape, from such a small town,

31:13.880 --> 31:20.320
you know, was so little traveling in his life, he would have had to have gotten everything from his imagination from books

31:21.600 --> 31:23.380
because he had not experienced any of that.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.140
To me, that's always been sort of a paradox.

31:26.100 --> 31:30.080
Part of it was, I think, his interest in the Celtic heritage.

31:31.220 --> 31:39.920
Wasn't that one of his big things, the belief in his famous or royal ancestors, which may or may not have existed,

31:40.300 --> 31:41.840
like Dr. Laugh, I'll tell you.

31:42.100 --> 31:47.800
He claimed that he was full blood Irish, and they were the Irish kings, like some other people we now claim to be.

31:48.280 --> 31:51.260
But there's no evidence that he certainly was not full blood Irish.

31:51.360 --> 31:56.240
People have traced his genealogy, but this was part of his image of himself.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.720
He was trying to project other people and trying to create for himself.

32:01.040 --> 32:10.160
There again, he wrote at one time that he wrote about the barren, cold, windswept, damp areas, even though he lived here.

32:10.440 --> 32:16.140
I think that again might be a sort of wishful film, and who wouldn't like to be someplace where it's cold on a day like this.

32:16.420 --> 32:22.760
He wanted to be away from where he was because I don't think we can underestimate the anger and frustration

32:23.180 --> 32:25.920
that was boiling around in Robert Howard all the time.

32:26.020 --> 32:32.880
I see it in all of his poetry, and a great deal of his fiction.

32:33.900 --> 32:40.720
Cross Plains neighbors say that he had a, there was a big tree stump out by his yard, and I believe it was a sledgehammer, not an axe.

32:41.140 --> 32:45.220
And sometimes in the middle of the day, he would go out there, you know, and he would just see that he was so tense,

32:45.640 --> 32:50.240
and he would take that sledgehammer and he would just wham it and wham it and wham it on this tree stump.

32:50.800 --> 32:55.100
That a tremendous amount of anger, he didn't fit in with other people.

32:55.460 --> 33:00.760
He wanted to be somewhere else, so he wrote about something that was like nothing he had experienced.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.580
It's hard not to psychoanalyze a guy like that, right?

33:04.920 --> 33:09.440
And see the barbarian chopping the heads off, and see him out there whamming the tree stump.

33:10.120 --> 33:10.920
You really can.

33:10.920 --> 33:20.240
In other words too, you think that perhaps his theory of the, what, the ancient heroes of the past sort of reliving,

33:20.880 --> 33:27.080
or their force, their power, whatever you want to call it, their heroic action, sort of living in modern men,

33:27.920 --> 33:34.760
he sort of saw himself as an ancestor, or what, a remnant of that kind of ancient hero?

33:35.180 --> 33:39.420
I descend that the last one left, the one who didn't, didn't...

33:39.420 --> 33:40.180
The last count.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.920
Yes, he saw himself as the last count just about.

33:43.580 --> 33:46.120
Well, he didn't, he wouldn't go so far as to believe in reincarnation, would he?

33:46.280 --> 33:47.740
Sometimes it almost sounds like it.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.960
I'm not that good with it, but I really doubt that he actually believed it.

33:52.300 --> 33:55.940
I remember, and I forget, I think the character's name was James Allison,

33:56.540 --> 33:58.600
a Valley of the Worm, I think, in one of his works.

34:00.300 --> 34:06.840
He is, I think he's on the point of dying as James Allison character is, and he's like Howard, he's a remnant.

34:06.840 --> 34:11.100
He's a powerful individual, a great hero, he doesn't fit, but he's in the modern world.

34:12.460 --> 34:18.080
And he recalls the heroes from the Dragon Slayers, the Worm Slayers from the past,

34:18.800 --> 34:25.620
all the way back to an original, I think, who was called Njord, who killed a huge worm-like creature,

34:25.840 --> 34:34.220
back in prehistory, and Allison remembers all the incarnations that this hero's force had passed through to get to James Allison.

34:34.220 --> 34:38.700
Which makes you wonder how much H. Ryder Haggard was in his library.

34:39.340 --> 34:43.760
Was there any? That sounds a lot like H. Ryder Haggard's heroes.

34:50.880 --> 34:56.540
There again, I don't think, I don't know how seriously you can take anything that Howard said he believed,

34:56.720 --> 35:03.060
because he was constantly trying to create an image of himself and project that to other people.

35:03.060 --> 35:06.520
So I don't think we can say he did believe in reincarnation or he didn't.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.020
If he said outright that he did, it doesn't mean that he did.

35:12.900 --> 35:17.860
He was interested too in all kinds of sports, wasn't he? Boxing, football, manly sports?

35:18.120 --> 35:25.000
He did not like football, didn't like any kind of team sports. He liked boxing, he liked the idea of fencing.

35:25.560 --> 35:29.340
The sports he was interested in, well he did go to football games some,

35:29.340 --> 35:35.160
but from his experience with the basketball team when he was a young boy, he was not good at team sports,

35:35.280 --> 35:40.960
he couldn't cooperate with other people, and he saw the truly admirable sports to be the one on one.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.560
He's been a good hockey player, where he's whacked people over the pail.

35:45.460 --> 35:51.360
What's he a good boxer, do you know? I mean, you said he took care of himself, he was very interested in physical fitness.

35:52.060 --> 35:57.620
And is there a picture of him in the last cal, striking the hose with the fists up?

35:58.320 --> 36:02.240
But I don't know of any actual fights that he ever got into.

36:02.400 --> 36:07.580
No, I don't believe so. To answer your other question, he had three H. Ryder Haverd books in his library.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.540
Alan Quatermain, is that the title? Yeah.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.580
Ancient Alan and People of the Rest.

36:13.220 --> 36:14.660
That's a good surprise.

36:17.360 --> 36:26.140
Dr. Loughlin, can you tell us something about the discovery of the Howard manuscripts and the controversies and the problems that have come up in that area?

36:26.600 --> 36:28.300
Yes, a little bit of it.

36:30.520 --> 36:34.140
Elsbraig de Camp really didn't get interested in Howard until...

36:39.840 --> 36:42.400
And in ten minutes it's going to do it again. Ten minutes?

36:42.780 --> 36:43.680
So talk for ten minutes.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.040
Just start it right here, right where you...

36:46.040 --> 36:51.900
Yes, Elsbraig de Camp didn't get interested in Howard until about 1950, when he first read Calden and the Conqueror.

36:51.900 --> 36:54.260
Perhaps it was 1949, but it was around that time.

36:54.900 --> 36:57.820
Then, I don't know how you say it, is it Jorn Nieburg?

36:59.080 --> 37:00.040
Jorn Nyberg.

37:00.140 --> 37:08.580
Jorn Nyberg wrote him that he had written a Conan type of book to practice his English and asked Mr. de Camp to redo it.

37:09.180 --> 37:14.800
And I believe he was trying... Mr. de Camp was trying to sell this story to Don Woham, or he was...

37:14.800 --> 37:17.120
For some reason he was discussing it with Don Woham.

37:17.120 --> 37:27.040
And Woham said, well, I understand that Oscar J. Friend has a whole box of unpublished Howard manuscripts, which you'd be interested in those.

37:27.700 --> 37:31.440
And Mr. de Camp just came unglued. Yes, I'm interested in the very next day.

37:31.540 --> 37:37.660
He went rushing over to Oscar Friends and asked for the box. I don't know if he had to pay for them.

37:38.060 --> 37:44.440
Oscar J. Friend was a literary agent associated with Otis Klein literary agency that Robert Howard used.

37:44.440 --> 37:50.680
And he still had this box of things. It was in... That was in November of 1950.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.700
So actually Mr. de Camp was the one who found the first hoard of manuscripts.

37:56.160 --> 38:03.040
And then a little later, it was either Friends or Klein's daughter inherited that literary agency.

38:03.340 --> 38:06.720
And she did not want to handle Howard manuscripts. She didn't like the stuff.

38:07.100 --> 38:09.540
And so she told that a camp said, have to find someone else.

38:09.540 --> 38:16.100
And Mrs. de Camp wanted to be the literary executor. But Mr. de Camp didn't think this would be fair.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.780
You see, because they had the manuscripts, didn't mean they had the copyright.

38:20.040 --> 38:26.300
The copyright was still owned by the Kirk and Dolls because Dr. Howard had left the Kirk and Dolls everything,

38:26.780 --> 38:29.580
which included the rights to his son's copyright.

38:30.260 --> 38:32.160
So they were having a deal with the Kirk and Dolls.

38:32.280 --> 38:36.640
And Mr. de Camp thought it might be a little bit fair for his own life to be the literary executor.

38:36.640 --> 38:41.520
So he called Glen Lord. He had never met him. I don't believe they had corresponded.

38:41.560 --> 38:47.480
He was just a very active fan. And he asked Glen Lord to do it, which of course they agreed to do.

38:48.100 --> 38:55.520
And he took his job very seriously. And he traced down a second box of unpublished manuscripts in California.

38:56.220 --> 39:03.280
When Robert died, his father seemed to find it very painful to have things of Roberts around the house.

39:03.280 --> 39:10.040
So he gave them away. He gave away baby pictures. Very nice studio portrait baby pictures.

39:10.460 --> 39:16.540
He gave away all of his manuscripts. And he gave one box, I believe, was to Clark Ashton Smith.

39:16.960 --> 39:21.260
It was someone in California, a writer with whom Howard had cordial correspondence.

39:21.880 --> 39:27.000
And he felt very grateful to the people who had had cordial relations with Robert because he had so few friends.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.460
So his father gave all of them presents, mementos of Robert.

39:31.080 --> 39:36.700
And whoever this writer was, it may have been Smith, loaned the box of manuscript to a fan.

39:38.860 --> 39:41.420
And the fan never returned them. He couldn't get them back.

39:42.020 --> 39:48.520
And then in the meantime, Clark Ashton Smith or whatever the writer was, and the fan both died.

39:49.360 --> 39:55.160
And the box of manuscripts is in some of the things that the family goes through.

39:55.160 --> 39:59.880
And they don't know what they are or what to do with them. So they're just stuffed off somewhere in the box and forgotten about.

40:00.980 --> 40:04.980
And then Lord managed to trace that down. Sort of a little detective hunt.

40:05.140 --> 40:08.900
But he had to go on to find them. And he did find that in 1965.

40:09.840 --> 40:14.960
And he had to buy them from, you know, buy the physical manuscripts. He didn't have to buy the copyright.

40:15.360 --> 40:19.980
But he had to buy them from whoever had them at the time. And that was far none as close some.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.240
I understand it was sizable in 1965.

40:24.440 --> 40:29.200
Do you think we have all of Howard manuscripts today? Or might there still be some around?

40:29.320 --> 40:35.640
There's always rumors that there are some around. You know, it was when Dr. Howard gave the library to Howard Payne,

40:35.680 --> 40:42.200
there were rumors that he also gave the manuscripts. We do know that he gave copies of the pulp magazines that Howard had been published in.

40:42.640 --> 40:49.180
And at some time, Dr. Howard came and retrieved the magazines. He told his friends that the students were reading them to pieces.

40:49.180 --> 40:56.940
And that's why he came to get them. The story around Howard Payne is that the librarian thought that the ladies on the covers of weird tales

40:56.940 --> 41:00.460
and the pulp magazines were not quite far-belonged at a Baptist university.

41:00.740 --> 41:03.900
So she hid them in the basement of Old Main, which is the building right now.

41:04.260 --> 41:08.340
And he got rather damp down there than were ruining. So that's why the father got them.

41:08.700 --> 41:12.400
The story, there's a story that T. R. Havens, who was a historian here.

41:13.240 --> 41:17.900
And the librarian, another librarian, well, she was not a librarian. She was a secretary or something.

41:17.900 --> 41:23.760
Lena Vincent, Tuit Vincent's sister, Tuit Vincent was a close friend of Howard, who he lives in Austin now.

41:24.160 --> 41:31.200
That Lena Vincent and T. R. Havens realized that this librarian was going to throw out a bunch of this junk that she thought was un-Christian.

41:31.720 --> 41:37.760
So they put it in the back seat of their car and someone said the whole back seat was full and it included manuscripts.

41:38.280 --> 41:48.120
And people have even, it might have been, in large, someone actually saw one of the manuscripts in Dr. Haven's desk here about 15 years ago.

41:48.340 --> 41:52.940
And he had a type script that he pulled out and showed. But Dr. Havens is now dead.

41:53.640 --> 41:59.180
His widow is now dead. And if there was anything there, we'll probably never hear from him.

42:00.260 --> 42:06.920
I think also an extension of that kind of confusion is the, what happens today if you walk into a bookstore and go to the fantasy section,

42:06.920 --> 42:12.140
you'll find at least three publishing houses publishing the Howard material.

42:12.280 --> 42:17.600
I think it's Berkeley and Bantam and Ace, I believe it is. Or is Lancer a fourth one?

42:18.040 --> 42:24.300
Lancer has gone out of business. Now that's an interesting story too. That's part of the controversy of the publication of what happened.

42:24.620 --> 42:28.920
And part of the zebra business is also, it's still with Lancer.

42:28.920 --> 42:33.580
Because Zacharias or whatever his name is was associated with both of them.

42:34.460 --> 42:40.340
The Lancer books were authorized. They were paid a certain amount for them. Nothing exorbitant.

42:40.840 --> 42:47.480
When Lancer went out of business, I believe it was Mr. Zacharias, took some of the things to zebra books.

42:49.760 --> 42:54.920
Then Lancer sold to someone who was buying up bankrupt companies.

42:55.660 --> 43:04.480
And they were claiming a law under which a company that does not go bankrupt but reorganizes does not lose the copyrights.

43:05.140 --> 43:11.400
In the contracts they had, they had a bankruptcy cause. And if the publisher went bankrupt, they got back the copyrights.

43:11.400 --> 43:14.460
But they were in court for years on that.

43:14.460 --> 43:20.920
And in the meantime, Glen Lord and some others sold the rights to Berkeley.

43:21.580 --> 43:25.180
For what Mr. DeCamp thought was a pittance or something like that, I understand.

43:25.880 --> 43:32.220
But sure enough, they lost the suit. And Lancer was allowed to claim.

43:32.880 --> 43:34.180
You should have taken out the hook.

43:38.100 --> 43:42.820
Glen Lord and some of the Conan group felt certain that they would win the lawsuit with Lancer.

43:42.820 --> 43:47.920
So they went ahead and sold the rights to the Conan material to Berkeley Books.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.460
And Berkeley started producing the books, publishing them.

43:50.940 --> 43:55.160
But in the meantime, they lost the lawsuit. Lancer won.

43:55.360 --> 43:58.480
They were allowed to claim that it was a reorganization, not a bankruptcy.

43:59.180 --> 44:02.140
So the copyrights did not return for the publishing rights.

44:03.340 --> 44:09.340
And the reorganizer, the person who had actually bought Lancer out, had sold the rights to Ace Books.

44:09.340 --> 44:15.860
And Ace had already produced them all, that 12 numerical series of Conan books.

44:15.980 --> 44:20.820
They were all ready to go. And when this decision was reached in, I think, March of 77,

44:22.460 --> 44:24.480
they rushed them to the market immediately.

44:24.940 --> 44:27.320
And the writers and the Conan people didn't get any money.

44:27.540 --> 44:31.160
And they actually called it a kind of piracy.

44:31.780 --> 44:33.320
But they settled that out.

44:33.500 --> 44:36.160
Of course, they didn't engage a lawyer, author, Lieberman,

44:36.160 --> 44:39.420
who had them organize what he called Conan properties,

44:39.900 --> 44:43.520
which has made Conan a registered trademark so that not anybody can use it.

44:43.980 --> 44:46.680
And I don't know exactly who all the members of Conan properties are,

44:46.700 --> 44:50.720
but it includes DeKamp and Glen Lard and Arthur Lieberman the lawyer.

44:51.340 --> 44:54.600
And I want to say Kirby McCauley, who was the literary agent.

44:55.600 --> 44:59.160
And there are two others. I believe there are six people, so people who are members of that.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.620
Is there an authorized publisher at the present time?

45:04.840 --> 45:07.220
Bantam is doing the new pastiches.

45:07.880 --> 45:11.760
And so far as I know, Ace is doing all of the older things.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.880
But I don't know about an authorized publisher.

45:15.220 --> 45:17.020
Is this by agreement among themselves?

45:17.400 --> 45:20.700
Like Bantam does the pastiches, you say?

45:21.680 --> 45:23.680
Just the pastiches? Dr. Crater, is that correct?

45:24.160 --> 45:29.940
Well, not entirely, because they've done the Solomon King books and some of the others.

45:29.940 --> 45:36.880
But I know that recently Ace has been issuing the Conan originals by Howard,

45:37.100 --> 45:41.520
that is the reprints of the Conan series are being done by Ace, apparently.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.240
I don't believe anything is done by agreement among themselves.

45:44.380 --> 45:47.500
There's tremendous lawsuits that go on over the whole thing.

45:48.200 --> 45:52.200
I'm certain Conan properties had to settle with Ace about what they could do.

45:53.280 --> 45:56.740
Now the writers of the pastiches can deal with the publisher directly,

45:56.740 --> 46:02.740
but a portion of anything they do that is a Conan pastiche has to be paid into Conan properties.

46:03.500 --> 46:07.420
And Glen Lorde's literary agent gets 5% off the top of that.

46:07.740 --> 46:10.340
Now he was not always a literary agent, Kirby McCauley was,

46:10.820 --> 46:14.660
but Glen Lorde, I believe now is the one who gets the 5%.

46:14.660 --> 46:19.060
In other words, a publishing house can contract with any author to do a Conan book,

46:19.920 --> 46:23.260
as long as it's a pastiche and a certain percentage is given to the estate.

46:23.260 --> 46:28.780
Well, the Conan properties has to agree to let you use that name.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.960
And they don't agree to let just anybody use it.

46:32.500 --> 46:37.840
And if they agree to let you use the name, a certain percentage of your profits has to be paid to them.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.380
How many authors are doing pastiches or have none?

46:42.120 --> 46:48.520
We don't know of Andy Offit, Paul Anderson, Al Sprave Camp, Len Carter,

46:49.140 --> 46:52.640
DeKamp and Carter in collaboration, Bjorn Nyberg,

46:53.480 --> 46:55.420
and DeKamp in collaboration.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.860
Who have we left out?

47:01.360 --> 47:06.720
Now, as we said, I think Carl Edward Wagner was planning to do one.

47:07.260 --> 47:08.400
He did one, didn't he?

47:08.480 --> 47:12.280
He did one, and planning to a second, that one never appeared.

47:12.420 --> 47:13.820
But I believe he did do one.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.100
So that would be another one.

47:15.720 --> 47:18.380
He did one in a band-aum, series of six.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.980
What about those kinds that you just meant?
