00:02.060 --> 00:09.000
NASA Space Note number 82-1. 60 seconds, coming in three, two, one.

00:11.820 --> 00:16.240
This is a NASA Space Note from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.

00:18.840 --> 00:28.020
One of the areas that we stand to benefit most from spaceflight is the ability
to make scientific observations of the earth from space. On the next space

00:28.020 --> 00:36.100
shuttle mission scheduled for October, the orbiter will become an Earth
observatory and the astronauts will be gathering geologic, geographic and

00:36.100 --> 00:45.060
oceanographic information about our planet. One of the most interesting
experiments onboard is the shuttle imaging radar. First flown on the second

00:45.060 --> 00:55.520
space shuttle mission, the radar penetrated the arid sands of Sahara to find 60
,000 year-old river channels. On this mission, scheduled for October, astronaut

00:55.520 --> 01:04.580
Kathy Sullivan will become the first woman to conduct a spacewalk. Together with
Commander Dave Leestma, she'll be demonstrating the capability of refueling

01:04.580 --> 01:09.180
satellites in space. This has been a NASA Space Note.

01:15.380 --> 01:22.920
NASA Space Note number 82-2, 60 seconds, coming in three, two, one.

01:25.720 --> 01:36.660
This is a NASA space note from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. In an intricate set of maneuvers in space, three satellites from

01:36.660 --> 01:45.400
three different nations will create artificial clouds and an imitation comet to
study the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field. The

01:45.400 --> 01:53.260
solar wind is made up of hot, electrically charged particles that constantly
rush outward from the sun's surface. Scientists want to know where these

01:53.260 --> 02:01.180
particles enter the magnetic field and how they are circulated and elevated to
tremendous energies and whether they are the source of the Van Allen Radiation

02:01.180 --> 02:10.620
Belts. The three satellites, called Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer
Explorers, or AMPTE, one from Germany, one from England and another from NASA,

02:11.000 --> 02:19.880
will work together gathering measurements that an international team of
scientists hope will provide a flow of valuable new information. This has been a

02:19.880 --> 02:20.940
NASA space note.

02:29.760 --> 02:37.460
NASA space note number 82-3. 60 seconds, coming in 3, 2, 1.

02:40.300 --> 02:50.060
This is a NASA space note from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. In ancient Greece, Spartan soldiers carried only the barest

02:50.060 --> 02:59.040
essentials with them to do their jobs, yet they performed with efficiency. NASA
now applies the same approach to scientific investigations with the Spartan

02:59.040 --> 03:08.000
program, which follows the same fundamental philosophy as the sounding rocket
program. The satellites are simple and cost-effective. Each Spartan is an

03:08.000 --> 03:17.260
autonomous satellite deployed from and retrieved by the space shuttle. Three
SPARTAN missions are currently under development. SPARTAN 1 will study clusters

03:17.260 --> 03:27.540
of galaxies emitting energy in the form of x-rays, SPARTAN 2 solar physics
phenomena, and SPARTAN 3 ultraviolet astronomy. SPARTAN, a simple, reusable, and

03:27.540 --> 03:37.840
low-cost tool for investigating a range of scientific problems from atmospheric
dynamics to perplexing mysteries of the cosmos. This has been a NASA Space Note.

03:44.000 --> 03:52.440
NASA Spacenote number 82-4. 60 seconds, coming in 3, 2, 1.

03:55.140 --> 04:06.500
This is a NASA Spacenote from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Gamma rays are the most energetic form of radiation known. They offer insight

04:06.500 --> 04:15.820
into the violent aspects of the space medium and how these processes influence
such puzzling objects as pulsars, quasars, black holes, and the ultra bright

04:15.820 --> 04:24.760
stars called supernovae. To investigate this area of cosmic radiation, NASA is
developing, jointly with Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, a

04:24.760 --> 04:33.700
spacecraft called the Gamma Ray Observatory to be launched in 1988. The
observatory, which is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, will give

04:33.700 --> 04:42.400
scientists an opportunity to study a broad range of cosmic phenomena, such as
the origins of extremely high energy bursts, the nuclear processes occurring

04:42.400 --> 04:52.100
near neutron stars and black holes, and the nature of recently discovered gamma
ray sources in our own Milky Way galaxy. This has been a NASA space note.

04:59.200 --> 05:07.700
NASA space note number 82-5. 60 seconds coming in 3, 2, Two. One.

05:10.720 --> 05:20.480
This is a NASA Space Note from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Approximately every seventy-six years, the world's most famous

05:20.480 --> 05:29.220
Comet sweeps past the Earth, becoming the focus of attention for amateur and
professional astronomers. When Comet Halley returns again in the winter of 85

05:29.220 --> 05:38.520
and 86, it will be intensively studied from the ground, air and space. NASA's
International Halley Watch was established to coordinate activities of ground

05:38.520 --> 05:47.000
based astronomers around the world and to compile the Halley Archives, which
will be the largest collection of information ever assembled on a comet. Other

05:47.000 --> 05:55.440
observations will include a space shuttle based astro observatory consisting of
specially designed ultraviolet telescopes and wide-field cameras, and an

05:55.440 --> 06:03.880
unmanned satellite deployed by the shuttle called SPARTAN. Existing NASA
satellites, including solar max, will also be reoriented to take a look at

06:03.880 --> 06:06.480
Halley. This has been a NASA Space Note.

06:14.800 --> 06:33.520
NASA Space Note number 82-6. 60 seconds coming in 3, 2, 1. This is a NASA Space
Note from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. For many years,

06:33.660 --> 06:41.160
astronomers learned about the universe by looking at it in the narrow part of
the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light. Later they discovered that

06:41.160 --> 06:50.080
stars send out kinds of energy that we cannot see, such as infrared and
ultraviolet radiation, radio waves, x-rays, and gamma rays. Each part of the

06:50.080 --> 06:57.320
spectrum offers a different set of clues to the origin and evolution of the
universe. A certain wavelength range, which has never had an astronomical

06:57.320 --> 07:06.660
survey, is called the Extreme Ultraviolet Region. Objects in this range are
generally stars in highly advanced stages of their evolution. NASA's Extreme

07:06.660 --> 07:16.380
Ultraviolet Explorer, scheduled to be launched in 1987, will make an all-sky
survey of the Extreme Ultraviolet Range. Observation of a large number of mature

07:16.380 --> 07:23.260
stars is expected to provide better understanding of star evolution. This has
been a NASA Space Note.

07:30.400 --> 07:39.080
NASA Space Note number 82-7, 60 seconds, coming in 3, 2, 1.

07:41.840 --> 07:51.620
This is a NASA Space Note from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. In a dramatic rescue mission this November, the Space Shuttle

07:51.620 --> 08:01.140
Discovery will try to recover at least one of the two communication satellites
lost in space last February. The satellites were placed in useless orbits 644

08:01.140 --> 08:11.320
miles high when their onboard rocket engines misfired. The satellites were
supposed to reach geosynchronous orbit 22,335 miles above Earth in orbits which

08:11.320 --> 08:20.460
would allow them to fly continuously over the same spot. In the rescue mission,
commands would be sent to the satellites to drop to a 200-mile-high orbit. Their

08:20.460 --> 08:29.540
spin would be slowed from 40 revolutions to 1 a minute. An astronaut wearing a
jet-powered backpack would then rendezvous with the satellite and position it so

08:29.540 --> 08:37.280
it could be pulled by the shuttle's robot arm into the cargo bay, where it would
be returned back to Earth. This has been a NASA space note.

08:45.840 --> 08:54.180
NASA space note number 82-8. 60 seconds coming in three, two, one.

08:56.920 --> 09:07.220
This is a NASA Space Note from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. For 25 years, the American space program has been a stimulus for

09:07.220 --> 09:14.880
young people to set their goals high and to strive for excellence. Although in
the past, participation of the public in the exciting moonwalks and space

09:14.880 --> 09:23.500
shuttle missions has been through real-time television coverage, NASA's
spaceflight participation program will now allow ordinary citizens to actually

09:23.500 --> 09:31.600
fly on the space shuttle. President Reagan recently announced that an elementary
or secondary school teacher would be chosen as the first citizen to fly into

09:31.600 --> 09:39.760
space aboard the shuttle. The decision was made because the teachers ability to
effectively communicate their knowledge to large groups of students would allow

09:39.760 --> 09:47.960
them to inspire young people to become interested in space, science, in
mathematics. The person chosen to go will be required to spend a year after the

09:47.960 --> 09:54.280
flight talking about his or her experiences to the nation's school children.
This has been a NASA Space Note.

10:01.120 --> 10:09.600
NASA Space Note number 82-9, 60 seconds coming in three, two, one.

10:12.020 --> 10:22.980
This is a NASA Space Note from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. In 1978, NASA launched Seasat, an imaging satellite designed to

10:22.980 --> 10:31.740
collect data on changing conditions in the world's oceans. Seasat operated only
three months, but produced volumes of data, and confirmed that satellites can

10:31.740 --> 10:40.740
provide valuable information that is useful in practical applications as well as
in scientific studies. NASA is now planning a highly advanced successor to

10:40.740 --> 10:49.480
Seasat, a satellite that would provide a vastly improved capability for
observing the oceans on a global basis. The Ocean Topography Experiment or

10:49.480 --> 10:58.240
Topex, will make radar measurements over the entire ocean basins for several
years providing information that will offer practical benefits in such areas as

10:58.240 --> 11:08.140
weather prediction, coastal storm warning, maritime safety, waste disposal, ship
design, ship routing, and food production from ocean sources. This has been a

11:08.140 --> 11:09.160
NASA Space Note.

11:16.580 --> 11:25.140
NASA Space Note number 82-10. 60 seconds coming in three two one.

11:27.900 --> 11:37.680
This is a NASA Space Note from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. An exciting discovery was recently made at NASA's Ames Research

11:37.680 --> 11:47.500
Center in California. The simplest version ever seen of one of life's basic
enzymes was found in a salt-loving bacterium. Until now only one form of this

11:47.500 --> 11:55.880
energy producing enzyme was known to exist in all living systems. Researchers
believe that the newly discovered enzyme maybe left over from early evolution

11:55.880 --> 12:04.680
and hope it will provide a model for how early cells function. evolution. The
discovery was made by NASA researcher Larry Hochstein. According to Hochstein,

12:04.840 --> 12:12.760
the enzyme must have had an early origin in evolution, since it performs an
essential function and is found in all living creatures. The fact that only a

12:12.760 --> 12:21.980
very complex form of this enzyme exists in present living systems led the Ames
Group to search for evidence of a simpler, earlier version. This has been a NASA

12:21.980 --> 12:22.660
Space Note.
