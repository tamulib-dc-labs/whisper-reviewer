Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.180 --> 00:33.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.780
And here are your hosts.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.900
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

00:44.220 --> 00:48.400
Science Fiction author Dean Eing has been putting out some exciting and provocative books in the past few years.

00:49.040 --> 00:53.920
Soft Targets was published as a novel in 1979, then came the very popular Anasazi in 1980,

00:54.280 --> 00:57.300
and Systemic Shock in 1981, and he's got a bunch more on the way.

00:57.580 --> 01:01.740
But Eing actually started publishing science fiction a long time ago. We asked him about his early stories.

01:01.740 --> 01:10.040
My first published story was early in 1955. I wrote it in 1954. It was called Tight Squeeze.

01:12.400 --> 01:21.640
And I know it's in some old compilations of stories back in the 50s. And about a year and a half later,

01:21.640 --> 01:30.460
I think I guess the summer of 1956, I had one published that is called Red Rover.

01:32.060 --> 01:38.480
Now, Red Rover has been reprinted in an anthology about two years ago.

01:39.720 --> 01:45.100
But Tight Squeeze, I believe, has never been reprinted, which is not too surprising as a story.

01:45.100 --> 01:54.440
He doesn't know all that good. As a suggestion of the kinds of problems that a mechanic was liable to have in free fall,

01:55.780 --> 02:01.880
working in an orbital situation, it was, I think, a pretty good story.

02:02.780 --> 02:05.860
Then Eing quit writing science fiction for almost two decades. We asked him why.

02:05.860 --> 02:15.580
I quit writing then for almost 20 years because I had sent another story, which was clearly a fake piece,

02:16.780 --> 02:21.240
clearly a complaint about the way we were centralizing in bigger and bigger cities.

02:21.920 --> 02:30.920
The story I wrote, which I can't even recall the name of now, it was turned down by Horace Gould of Galaxy.

02:31.880 --> 02:37.520
And Horace's scribbled complaint to me was that it was a terrific storytelling but not much of a story.

02:38.120 --> 02:46.760
That I was, it was perfectly clear that I was up on a soapbox haranguing the reader.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.920
And Horace was just entertaining. That's all he was. Well, that made me mad.

02:52.100 --> 02:58.000
I didn't think that my particular position in life was as an entertainer.

02:59.160 --> 03:07.160
And I realized if I couldn't make the things that I had to say interesting enough so that I could entertain and inform at the same time,

03:07.300 --> 03:12.680
then I wouldn't write. And that's the truth. I couldn't. I didn't know the craft that well at the time.

03:13.180 --> 03:17.400
I could either entertain you or I could write some information down.

03:18.440 --> 03:23.280
Eing did a number of things during his time away from science fiction, designing and building race cars as one of them,

03:23.420 --> 03:25.600
where principally he went to work as an aerospace engineer.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.720
After a number of years, though, he grew tired of that type of employment.

03:29.500 --> 03:40.860
It wasn't until some years later that I realized that I had almost nothing to say about what was done with my abilities.

03:41.780 --> 03:49.680
Whatever ingenuity I might have was not going to be used as I chose but as the administration chose.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.640
As long as I worked for some large company.

03:55.580 --> 04:06.020
And so I got more and more out of that, did more and more design work, development of all kinds of notions in my home lab.

04:06.660 --> 04:11.520
Not just building racing cars but developing the fiberglass rivet technique,

04:13.120 --> 04:22.340
developing a multi-manometric gauge gadget that you could put on a prototype automobile

04:22.340 --> 04:33.340
and drive the car at various speeds on a freeway and get wind tunnel data from it.

04:33.940 --> 04:45.200
Things like that. I think we wanted to do it and I never had much opportunity to get anything out of it through the industries that I worked in.

04:45.940 --> 04:50.340
So I decided to head for those guys. I would do all my work on my own.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.420
We'll talk about Deining's fiction next time.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.920
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:03.240 --> 05:09.000
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:55.960 --> 06:00.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:15.760 --> 06:21.020
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.360
And here are your hosts.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.380
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

06:31.860 --> 06:36.680
Deining's Science Fiction is usually set in the near future in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

06:36.840 --> 06:42.880
Anasazi is set in 1996, systemic shock around the same time and soft targets in the early 1980s.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.140
We wondered why he worked in that time frame so often.

06:45.860 --> 06:51.840
I think that the 80s and 90s give me a whole lot more clarity.

06:52.520 --> 07:01.360
It's really tough to see what's going on, to have much of a clear vision as to what's going to happen 30 or 40 years from now.

07:02.640 --> 07:12.760
I have, from the 1950s, I've had some fairly clear notions as to what the future would hold.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.140
And I have a pretty good batting average on that.

07:16.560 --> 07:27.000
Just for one example, to look at my very short and not very important career in sports car racing,

07:27.520 --> 07:35.180
I quit after two or three years and wrote some letters, open letters to editors and so on, of the racing fraternity,

07:35.180 --> 07:43.200
saying that our overuse of gasoline and this waste of energy was really not in the best interest of the human race,

07:43.280 --> 07:44.720
and we were all going to be sorry for it.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.860
This was in 1961 and 62.

07:48.420 --> 07:54.520
And I set about trying to demonstrate how much better machines we could have than we did have.

07:55.180 --> 08:00.220
Well, the cars that I built, one of them is out in my garage right now.

08:00.220 --> 08:04.340
It looks like next year's Porsche and it's 20 years old.

08:06.660 --> 08:15.480
My perceptions of what was going to happen 15, 20, 25 years in the future have been fairly good.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.900
And I would rather write about things that I feel more firmly familiar with.

08:21.420 --> 08:26.400
It's just awfully hard for me to figure out what's going to happen in the year 2010, let's say.

08:26.620 --> 08:28.760
However, I am working on it.

08:29.760 --> 08:35.600
Inge's stories are all built around strong thematic ideas, things like nuclear war, the power of the media and the medical profession.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.840
We asked him how he goes about writing a story.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.880
Does the theme come first, then the character is in plot, or is it the other way around?

08:42.700 --> 08:45.300
It is the theme usually that comes first.

08:46.020 --> 08:51.800
I have on occasion, sometimes just as an exercise, or sometimes just for fun,

08:51.800 --> 08:55.580
or because a friend will ask me to do so.

08:57.060 --> 09:04.060
There is an anthology that Larry Niven did based on his book called The Magic Goes Away.

09:04.620 --> 09:13.000
I don't do much fantasy, but Larry's fantasy was a very clever one, a very good one.

09:13.080 --> 09:17.400
It even had a sense of scientific basis for magic.

09:17.400 --> 09:27.380
He asked me to do a story for a sequel, and I was very happy to do that.

09:28.720 --> 09:36.600
But it's one of the few stories that I've written in which I did not have what I consider an important theme to start with.

09:36.920 --> 09:45.200
So as you first suggest it, yes, I'll usually take a theme, then build plot and characters that go along with it.

09:45.980 --> 09:48.380
Ying's style is extremely fast-paced and exciting.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.640
We asked him if that skill came naturally to him, or if he had to work at it.

09:52.540 --> 09:55.580
I worked my buns off to get it, actually, Garrel.

09:56.240 --> 10:00.940
You've got to remember that I did get my doctorate in communication theory.

10:01.900 --> 10:06.740
And media theory is a fairly good size flood of that.

10:07.920 --> 10:13.580
And studying men like William Stevenson and his play theory of magic communication and so on

10:13.580 --> 10:23.440
taught me a lot about the kind of entertainment that an audience is liable to focus on.

10:24.960 --> 10:30.340
So again, as you said, it's something that I had to work at.

10:31.420 --> 10:32.800
It didn't just come naturally.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.540
Next time we'll talk with Dean Ying about his novella on a Sazi.

10:43.580 --> 10:49.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:49.080 --> 10:52.200
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:43.580 --> 11:47.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:03.180 --> 12:08.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:11.140 --> 12:12.760
And here are your hosts.

12:16.940 --> 12:22.140
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane, one of Dean Ying's most popular works as his novella on a Sazi.

12:22.620 --> 12:25.640
The plot concerns a group of aliens who have been stranded on Earth centuries ago

12:25.640 --> 12:27.700
and have taken over their bodies as some Pueblo Indians.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.700
The aliens are long-lived and over the centuries using the bodies of various hosts.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.780
They attempt to build a communication device that will bring more of their kind to Earth.

12:34.780 --> 12:39.760
The time period of the narrative is the 1990s, when the aliens are almost ready to finish their communicator.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.980
They're discovered by an archaeologist, a Pueblo Indian himself,

12:43.560 --> 12:45.800
and they attempt to kill him so that they can remain undiscovered.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.560
We asked Ying to tell us about the impetus behind on a Sazi.

12:49.400 --> 12:59.240
Well, for many years I've been interested in American, North American and Central American archaeology and anthropology.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.240
My master's degree was in American Indian Sign Talks.

13:05.360 --> 13:22.720
I had been in the Anasazi area numerous times and was aware of this mystery that still exists as to why those people moved down to the Anasazi.

13:22.900 --> 13:23.960
In fact, I should be more specific.

13:25.020 --> 13:31.220
The mystery as to why the American Indians who lived near the cliff dwellings,

13:31.220 --> 13:35.800
why they moved down under those cliffs and made those cliff dwellings to begin with.

13:36.360 --> 13:45.760
We know why they left, why they abandoned the cliff dwellings because of a great draught that was starving them out for 25 years or so.

13:46.380 --> 13:58.300
We know about the unbroken tradition of life in that area for centuries and centuries before they built the cliff dwellings.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.680
But we still do not know.

14:00.860 --> 14:05.220
We do not know today why they built those dwellings themselves.

14:05.780 --> 14:08.540
It would seem, well, perhaps they were afraid of something.

14:08.740 --> 14:10.600
They were retreating from something.

14:10.880 --> 14:16.800
Yet we have no significant information as to what they were retreating from.

14:18.380 --> 14:35.000
Well, it was my idea to set up a scenario that would explain why these people abandoned their homes or accessible places up on top of the maces and moved down into a sort of defensive fortification.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.560
Anasazi is an exciting book, an alien horror story really.

14:48.920 --> 14:52.880
Ng doesn't usually write about aliens in his fiction, so he asked him why he did so on Anasazi.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.820
I tried to do just about everything in a very short novel.

15:22.060 --> 15:31.460
It was an exercise in part to see how many kinds of a story I could write without making it seem jumbled.

15:32.260 --> 15:37.740
Even though Anasazi is a real thriller, it's an accurate piece of anthropology in his approach to the Pueblo Indian culture.

15:38.180 --> 15:41.880
In fact, Ng says he had access to some very current research on the Pueblo Indians.

15:41.880 --> 15:48.440
A friend of mine who was doing his doctoral dissertation on witchcraft, which was in Taos, Pueblo.

15:50.900 --> 15:56.720
And I was aware of all this and I had access to his tape recordings.

15:57.700 --> 16:05.940
And while he was setting about the early stages of his doctoral dissertation, I was already reading those tapes, making notes and so on,

16:05.940 --> 16:16.700
so that the book Anasazi, which came out before his dissertation did, had information that was not in the literature yet.

16:17.080 --> 16:23.780
What it amounted to was that I had a tomorrow morning's newspaper and when you have tomorrow morning's newspaper you always seem smarter than you are.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.980
We'll continue our conversation with Ng on our next show.

16:33.580 --> 16:42.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.960
Thank you.

17:30.740 --> 17:34.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:50.300 --> 17:55.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:58.460 --> 17:59.920
And here are your hosts.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.140
This is Daryl Lane.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.020
And David Carson.

18:06.460 --> 18:09.500
Dean Ng's first novel, Soft Targets, was published in 1979.

18:10.280 --> 18:14.660
It's a carefully plotted, very fast narrative about international terrorism and it's set in this decade.

18:15.080 --> 18:18.120
The basic theme of this story concerns the media, particularly television.

18:18.120 --> 18:25.760
Since the events Ng creates for the plot are so real and convincing and since the technology is present day stuff, the novel hardly seems to be science fiction.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.420
We asked Ng if he considers it to be science fiction.

18:29.160 --> 18:33.080
Yes, I do because it's sociological science fiction.

18:33.080 --> 18:40.360
There's engineering science fiction, you know, the hard sciences with hardware.

18:41.240 --> 18:50.100
And there are the, let's say, quasi-sciences, like psychology, sociology, and so on.

18:51.360 --> 18:57.700
Just as sure as 1984 with science fiction, so was Soft Targets.

18:58.640 --> 19:05.200
It involves some scientific hypotheses about media theory.

19:07.500 --> 19:18.680
That was truly the initial impetus for the story, was this theme of what we could do about this uneasy marriage between terrorism and television.

19:19.880 --> 19:30.500
That was a problem I saw in 1971 and I saw no solution for it that would work in a free society until about 76, I guess.

19:31.700 --> 19:51.260
In 1975 or 76, by still mulling the idea over, mulling over the problem, I came across this little set of hypotheses about how you could use the model of warfare, the media going to war against the terrorists.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.500
And see what media do when they go to war.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.740
What have they done in the past?

19:57.480 --> 19:59.040
How easy would it be to do it again?

19:59.040 --> 20:00.080
Would it be effective?

20:01.420 --> 20:03.440
And my conclusions were yes, it would be.

20:04.180 --> 20:05.600
So then I wrote the novel.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.980
Ng takes the television industry to task for helping to foment terrorism by giving it spectacular coverage.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.940
He believes the media should meet its responsibility and actively fight terrorism.

20:15.380 --> 20:19.180
Ng's idea regarding media and terrorism seems to be both logical and acceptable.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.340
Not by the media people.

20:21.340 --> 20:29.320
You know, it's not, they have the most selfish of reasons not to want that to be considered true.

20:30.900 --> 20:35.800
And of course if they can deny it, then they can continue being irresponsible.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.740
Which is of course what they want to do all along.

20:42.520 --> 20:47.760
A number of people in the top of our network media.

20:47.760 --> 20:56.760
I know that they have come across soft targets and they are none too pleased with it.

21:04.780 --> 21:09.020
Soft targets is so vivid and exciting as a narrative that it seems a natural choice for a movie.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.820
Does Ng think it will ever become one?

21:11.620 --> 21:16.720
I think personally the chances of it being made into a movie are perhaps one in a hundred.

21:17.820 --> 21:26.080
For one thing it really lays too much blame. It's very trenchant.

21:26.540 --> 21:31.880
I say too much. I mean for people in the media to be comfortable about it.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.540
It raises hell with the media leaders.

21:39.180 --> 21:46.460
For one thing it's not liable to be the kind of movie that would ever be shown on late night television.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.220
Because it takes television so much to task.

21:51.740 --> 22:02.400
Why would the TV people want to beat themselves about the hidden shoulders by showing a movie that snarls about their irresponsibility?

22:03.500 --> 22:04.620
Chances are they wouldn't.

22:05.460 --> 22:13.340
And when people make movies these days they are very clearly thinking about the TV rights later on.

22:14.020 --> 22:15.840
More with D. Neying on our next show.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show.

22:25.460 --> 22:31.240
A production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:14.080 --> 23:18.020
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show. So stay with us.

23:33.720 --> 23:39.000
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show. A commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.320
And here are your hosts.

23:47.140 --> 23:48.000
This is David D. Neying.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.400
And D. Neying.

23:49.400 --> 24:07.100
Neying is a fine writer, obviously talented and in command of any idea he pursues.

24:07.560 --> 24:10.080
We asked him why sometimes didn't turn his talents toward fantasy.

24:10.760 --> 24:19.200
I'm not really interested very much in writing about things that I don't believe in.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.020
That is, that I do not believe possible.

24:23.880 --> 24:30.020
You know, I would define fantasy as something that we know to be impossible.

24:30.840 --> 24:36.740
Now of course there are some things that we quote no unquote to be impossible to turn out to be possible after all.

24:36.740 --> 24:48.000
But to the degree that I believe them to be impossible, then I believe making scenarios based on the impossible is one definition of fantasy.

24:48.360 --> 24:52.480
And I have nothing against it for other people to do it.

24:55.040 --> 25:05.020
But there are so many issues, real issues about important things that I think need to be struggled with.

25:06.200 --> 25:12.340
That the reader, the public in general needs to struggle with these issues, with these real things.

25:13.200 --> 25:19.840
So much that I don't really have the time for Never Never Land.

25:20.760 --> 25:26.420
It's here in now land or soon to come land that I worry about a lot.

25:26.780 --> 25:28.220
I have children, I have grandchildren.

25:29.340 --> 25:32.640
I worry about those people. I worry about what's going to happen to them.

25:33.620 --> 25:41.880
I don't want the future to spring on them like some great animal and cut them all up.

25:42.020 --> 25:47.100
I would like us to be ready and armed for the unpleasant parts of the future.

25:48.620 --> 25:54.520
And so I don't feel that I have the time to spend on fantasy.

25:55.340 --> 25:57.780
We asked his opinion on the value of science fiction.

25:57.780 --> 26:05.820
I feel that science fiction is probably the most valuable fiction available to anyone today.

26:06.660 --> 26:10.420
Certainly it's our buffer against future shock if we'll only use it that way.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.560
It's an insulator, a lightning rod if you will.

26:15.020 --> 26:26.780
Science fiction does not have to be, but certainly can be a means of making you ready for the future

26:26.780 --> 26:29.400
before you find yourself suddenly in it.

26:31.200 --> 26:37.880
I was writing about computers and people talk to computers and they're talking back to them 25 years ago.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.140
Now I have a computer at home.

26:40.820 --> 26:45.440
It had not occurred to me 25 years ago that I really would have one at home.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.660
I would have thought that was only for people like Howard Hughes.

26:50.540 --> 26:54.600
But sure enough, just about everybody can have one today if you want one. Badly enough.

26:57.220 --> 27:00.660
Science fiction has that very powerful value.

27:01.500 --> 27:08.680
It can also let you escape. It certainly can be escape literature when you think they need that kind of entertainment.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.360
Inge's concern for the future is seen in many areas besides his science fiction.

27:13.820 --> 27:17.960
He's an inventor, for instance, who offers his ideas freely to the public without seeking patents.

27:18.500 --> 27:22.020
Inge can be categorized as a futurist too, as seen in his latest concern.

27:22.020 --> 27:34.560
And the thing that I'm moving on toward is what some people call the L5 situation or the L5 scenario.

27:34.960 --> 27:46.060
Having to do with habitats, with colonies literally built in space so that we do not have to live all of us on Earth permanently.

27:46.060 --> 27:55.960
I think that the human race's next major frontier is in building habitats out beyond Earth's atmosphere.

27:57.420 --> 28:04.600
That is a very important notion to me and that's where I'm doing a lot of my thinking today.

28:11.740 --> 28:16.790
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:17.420 --> 28:20.320
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:44.900 --> 28:46.300
Thank you.
