WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.320
Okay, we're rolling.

00:03.140 --> 00:06.720
First of all, I just wondered if you might tell us a little bit about how you were in

00:06.720 --> 00:08.640
the origin of the column in Locust, if you're right.

00:09.980 --> 00:20.360
Well, about two and a half years ago, I was invited to address a group of authors, American

00:20.360 --> 00:28.040
Society of Journalists and Authors, and I chose to talk to them about certain contractual

00:28.040 --> 00:33.200
causes that I thought might be pitfalls in most professional authors.

00:34.900 --> 00:41.400
In the questioning that followed, I found an appalling ignorance on the part of authors

00:42.260 --> 00:50.680
on the subject of contracts, and many of these people are highly respected professional journalists

00:50.680 --> 00:56.900
and book authors, and yet it was clear to me that they didn't know anything, or very much

00:56.900 --> 01:03.960
I should say, about how to read a contract, how to negotiate one, and how to alter a clause

01:03.960 --> 01:10.820
to their own benefit, and so I decided to write a column for the many other writers who

01:10.820 --> 01:12.600
probably are in the same position.

01:13.260 --> 01:19.640
And I asked Charles Brown, the editor of Locust, a publisher of Locust, I guess, whether he'd

01:19.640 --> 01:26.880
be interested in publishing it, and he was quite agreeable, and thereafter, I said,

01:26.880 --> 01:33.920
a number of magazines, newsletters published by other writers groups such as Western Writers

01:33.920 --> 01:41.760
of America, Romance Writers of America, Mystery Writers of America, took on the column because

01:41.760 --> 01:44.080
they felt the authors were in the same position.

01:45.580 --> 01:49.440
So actually, Locust then, was your first magazine of that type that you wrote the column for?

01:49.660 --> 01:54.200
Yes, Locust was, I still consider myself as writing the column for Locust.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.300
Okay, fine.

01:56.520 --> 02:01.960
Would you be allowed to tell me which science fiction authors are just some of them that

02:01.960 --> 02:02.640
you do represent?

02:03.340 --> 02:04.980
Well, no, I don't mind at all.

02:05.180 --> 02:09.340
It's a fairly common knowledge in the science fiction community.

02:09.960 --> 02:20.800
We represent Harlan Ellison, Gregory Benford, Greg Behr, Elizabeth Lin, Bartor Randall,

02:22.460 --> 02:32.680
Barry Wong here, Warren Norwood, Jessica Sammonson, and I'd say three or four more.

02:36.160 --> 02:42.600
Okay, if you had to sell a decent manuscript by an unknown author, would you prefer to

02:42.600 --> 02:46.640
work with Romance, the Western, the Mystery of Science Fiction, or what sort of genre

02:46.640 --> 02:46.960
literature?

02:46.960 --> 02:53.100
Well, my orientation has always been the paperbacked original market.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.740
Not that my agency doesn't handle hard covers.

02:56.860 --> 03:03.660
We handle quite a lot of them, dozens and dozens of hard covers, and many have been on

03:03.660 --> 03:07.200
the best seller list, book club selections, and so forth.

03:07.200 --> 03:19.400
But the broad of the industry is the paperbacked market, and the paperbacked market does break

03:19.400 --> 03:25.360
down into some fairly convenient genres, and agents, I guess, are a little bit like nomads

03:25.360 --> 03:29.120
in that they follow the source of life.

03:29.120 --> 03:37.240
And in this case, for instance, the hot market right now is the contemporary romances, and

03:37.240 --> 03:41.140
so we have a very active department in the contemporary romances.

03:42.460 --> 03:54.780
Science fiction has become somewhat soft since the Star Trek Star Wars phenomenon, and although

03:54.780 --> 04:04.560
it's still a very active market, we have noticed a kind of sorting out of important writers

04:04.560 --> 04:12.440
from what they call the mid-list writers, that is to say, those writers who aren't quite

04:13.720 --> 04:22.200
of the Brockbuster best seller category, and yet they're better than what some people might

04:22.200 --> 04:24.440
refer to as hacked writers.

04:25.040 --> 04:31.200
They find themselves in a market where there really isn't an audience anymore, so we have

04:31.200 --> 04:41.980
found that writers really have to choose between going to something else or becoming stars in

04:41.980 --> 04:43.140
the science fiction market.

04:43.780 --> 04:50.940
There's no middle ground anymore, and that's true just about all the genres, westerns, romance,

04:50.940 --> 04:59.640
maybe the place that is most open for new writers, inexperienced writers, but in the

04:59.640 --> 05:06.180
science fiction world, I think you must start with some advantage or you're going to have

05:06.180 --> 05:07.460
a tough struggle ahead of you.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.880
I think we've never spoken to an agent before, and from your perspective, I think you can

05:14.880 --> 05:18.560
answer certain questions that I think anybody else would have difficulty answering, and one

05:18.560 --> 05:25.120
of them I wanted to ask you is from your perspective, what determines the popularity of a genre of

05:25.120 --> 05:26.260
literature in paperback?

05:26.740 --> 05:29.700
Is it the publishers who create the taste, or what is the cause?

05:30.020 --> 05:30.860
It's hard to say.

05:31.060 --> 05:39.460
Sometimes the publishers create the taste, and sometimes the market, the consumer creates

05:39.460 --> 05:43.360
the demand, and sometimes it's the agent.

05:43.360 --> 05:49.840
For instance, I find myself very often in speaking to publishers, I find myself in a

05:49.840 --> 05:50.540
double role.

05:51.200 --> 05:57.540
I keep my ears open and try to listen to what a publisher tells me about what he's able

05:57.540 --> 06:04.760
to sell and what he's not able to sell, and so I have a kind of passive role in that I pass

06:04.760 --> 06:08.780
along to authors what the publishers tell me the market is doing.

06:08.780 --> 06:17.560
However, if I begin to notice a trend, I then try to help create a market by turning to other

06:17.560 --> 06:22.640
publishers and saying, listen, I've had lunch the last couple of months with four publishers,

06:22.980 --> 06:30.300
and they all tell me that hard science fiction is not as active as fantasy and source and

06:30.300 --> 06:35.100
sorcery, and so maybe you'd be interested in some source and sorcery.

06:35.100 --> 06:40.860
So an agent is in the position of shaping the market once it begins to detect the trend.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.960
Okay, that was interesting.

06:45.120 --> 06:49.360
I guess after reading a column, of course, I'm coming to understand how much influence an agent can have.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.880
I don't think I realized that before.

06:54.220 --> 06:57.220
Okay, I think I know the answer to this.

06:57.640 --> 07:01.240
In fact, most of the questions I'm asking you, I have some idea of what you'll say because of what I've

07:01.240 --> 07:03.520
read of your work, but still need to ask it.

07:05.140 --> 07:10.420
I know that you have different contracts for different clients or different authors, but say a contract

07:10.420 --> 07:15.520
was any sort of author, not just science fiction, is it dependent upon if an author is new or established

07:15.520 --> 07:17.320
according to what kind of contract you get?

07:18.200 --> 07:29.440
Well, I think authors and agents probably ought to try to penetrate through a lot of the haze

07:29.440 --> 07:37.820
that surrounds contractual negotiations and realize that the essential in a contractual negotiation is who has the power.

07:39.380 --> 07:49.100
For the beginning author, the first author or the author of some works from minor markets, the power

07:49.100 --> 07:52.260
definitely rests for the publisher, with the publisher.

07:52.440 --> 07:58.540
The publisher, the author in effect is saying to the publisher, I will sign anything you hand me

07:58.540 --> 08:00.320
if you publish me.

08:01.080 --> 08:08.740
And the publisher says, well, I'm glad to hear that because if you don't like our terms, we'll find somebody else to write for us.

08:09.140 --> 08:14.260
Now, obviously, the power in that equation lies with the publisher.

08:14.880 --> 08:19.440
However, as an author begins to develop, he has a following.

08:20.780 --> 08:22.140
His books begin to sell.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.740
The prices that he gets for his work begin to escalate.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.100
He may have a bestseller.

08:30.640 --> 08:35.240
He now has other publishers interested in publishing him.

08:35.660 --> 08:38.920
And now the equation is on the other foot, if I may mix the metaphor.

08:39.700 --> 08:45.500
And it's now the author who says, the publisher says, I will do anything to keep you.

08:45.960 --> 08:54.360
And the author says, well, then you'd better meet my terms because there are plenty of publishers out there who will publish me if you don't like what I have,

08:54.360 --> 08:56.320
the terms that I'm ready to dictate.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.320
So when you get down to it, it's raw power.

09:00.880 --> 09:11.760
And the agent tries to put himself in those power vectors, I guess you would say, and get some sense of where they converge.

09:12.380 --> 09:17.820
And that's the point at which a contract materializes.

09:17.820 --> 09:25.100
A contract is a direct reflection of the power flow between the two parties.

09:25.540 --> 09:30.900
And at the point where they all interface, that is what a contract reads.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.440
That's excellent. Very good. You're talking just like you're right, I think.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.840
I'm not sure that's good or bad.

09:39.700 --> 09:47.580
Listen, what science fiction fans are, I think, more fanatic than other types.

09:47.780 --> 09:52.740
And a lot of them, of course, are interested in writing and doing something besides just reading it.

09:53.040 --> 09:58.200
If somebody had reasonable amount of talent, what would you advise an aspiring science fiction author? Where should he begin?

09:58.520 --> 10:00.120
Always begin with the magazines.

10:01.840 --> 10:07.360
You're absolutely right about science fiction fans being more fanatic.

10:07.480 --> 10:21.540
But they are also fortunate in having a place where they can begin in the shorter media where most writers in other genres don't have the chance.

10:21.880 --> 10:26.480
I mean, there are very few places where a romance writer can tease.

10:27.380 --> 10:35.280
You know, you can't write romance short stories unless you try to write some of the slicker women's magazines.

10:35.560 --> 10:39.860
And they are, of course, very demanding in what they accept.

10:40.940 --> 10:49.020
There used to be Western magazines, many, many of them, but almost all of them are gone now.

10:49.020 --> 10:59.640
Mystery magazines are still a couple of them, but it's not like what it used to be when I got into the business about 25 years ago.

11:00.260 --> 11:08.420
So one of the few remaining genres that invites new talent and cultivates it is science fiction,

11:08.500 --> 11:15.160
where you have very active magazine market and anthology market for original stories.

11:15.980 --> 11:23.360
You also have the conventions, of course Western writers, romance writers, mystery writers also have their conventions,

11:24.000 --> 11:30.920
but certainly science fiction writers can out-convention anybody by ratios 10 to 1.

11:31.300 --> 11:38.500
So there's a lot of interplay where authors are always talking to one another,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.760
meeting editors, meeting professional writers,

11:41.760 --> 11:47.260
and there's a much tighter unity than there is in any other genre.

11:47.820 --> 11:56.120
So I would definitely advise any aspiring science fiction writer to start writing in the magazines.

11:56.380 --> 12:07.600
In fact, even some of my well-known clients, I still tell them to continue writing for science fiction magazines,

12:07.600 --> 12:14.160
even though they may get peanuts for their work compared to what they can get writing books,

12:14.520 --> 12:22.840
because the exposure among both science fiction editors and science fiction fans is terribly important.

12:25.340 --> 12:30.060
Okay, I just have about one or two more science fiction, and get on to some more general things.

12:30.060 --> 12:38.380
Would you happen to be working with any unpublished authors at present science fiction that we might look for?

12:40.640 --> 12:43.120
That question kind of catches me unaware.

12:44.400 --> 12:50.120
We have a number of people that we're, you know, we are establishing.

12:51.180 --> 12:57.780
It's very hard to say because in spite of what I said a few moments ago about getting published in magazines,

12:57.780 --> 13:04.600
I mean, like most other agents, we handle very little by way of short fiction.

13:05.080 --> 13:09.780
It's not profitable for an agent to handle science fiction stories,

13:11.260 --> 13:17.880
and there's very little that we can do for a short story writer that he or she can't do for him or herself.

13:19.020 --> 13:24.640
So by the time an author comes to us asking for representation,

13:24.640 --> 13:27.520
and we think that person might be interesting,

13:28.540 --> 13:38.060
he's probably had quite a number of stories published in the science fiction magazines.

13:38.260 --> 13:43.240
I will mention one author that I think is enormously talented,

13:43.900 --> 13:48.700
and will probably burst on the scenes within the next couple of years,

13:48.700 --> 13:55.500
and that's a writer named Dan Simmons who's beginning to make some appearances in Omni and some of the other magazines.

13:55.720 --> 14:03.300
He's a very, very talented writer, and we are about to take on some of his wrongful work.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.000
Okay, one more.

14:07.000 --> 14:16.820
I should accord my thanks to Harlan Ellison who was the first person to spot him and refer him to me.

14:18.380 --> 14:21.280
Okay, good. One more on science fiction.

14:23.280 --> 14:32.840
Are you working on selling or do you have in your hands any big manuscripts from some of your name authors that might be published in the near future?

14:32.840 --> 14:43.160
Well, Gregory Benford has the author of Timescape, which was the Inebula Award winner in the novel category for 1981,

14:44.120 --> 14:48.560
has two novels coming out in the next year.

14:49.140 --> 14:59.460
One is Against Infinity, which is coming out in April, will be published by Timescape Books and Hardcover, a wonderful novel.

14:59.460 --> 15:13.880
And I believe next February we will see, in the ocean of, excuse me, Across the Sea of Suns, which is the sequel to In the Ocean of Night,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.480
and is the second novel in a trilogy.

15:16.480 --> 15:30.840
We also have what I consider a great novel in the making by Richard Grant, who's made some appearances in magazines,

15:31.440 --> 15:39.900
but turned in a spectacular novel, which is now being shaped somewhat and redone.

15:39.900 --> 15:47.540
But it's some of the most brilliant writing I've ever read, and those who have had an early look at it agree with me.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.920
That is a very impressive job.

15:50.480 --> 15:56.960
And I know that when that book is finished, I believe it's got that celebrate all over us.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.380
Okay, do you like trilogies?

16:02.600 --> 16:06.300
Yes, I like them and I encourage them.

16:06.940 --> 16:18.120
I feel they're a very comfortable form for science fiction writers, in fact, for non-science fiction writers as well.

16:21.920 --> 16:35.480
The beauty of a trilogy, of course, from an ancient viewpoint, is in the kind of package deal that one can make where you not only sign an author up for a book,

16:35.480 --> 16:40.740
but you can sign him up for a sequel and a sequel after that.

16:41.580 --> 16:45.100
And the author knows where he's going to be two years from now.

16:45.180 --> 16:51.920
The publisher knows what he can expect over a couple of years, and unless the author one day runs out of steam,

16:52.240 --> 16:56.480
or gets bored with characters that he developed in book one or two,

16:57.920 --> 17:06.860
you can see a cumulative effect in the sales of a trilogy where publication of book two makes people scurry for book one,

17:07.180 --> 17:12.280
and publication of book three causes the publisher to reissue books one and two,

17:12.600 --> 17:17.600
and then they put them in a box set and they're reviewed as a whole.

17:17.880 --> 17:23.380
It's a very nice way of publishing books, but not everybody has a sequel in them.

17:25.260 --> 17:29.360
Right. Why does an author with reasonable talent need an agent?

17:33.040 --> 17:46.480
There are very few authors who, once they achieve publication, are really able or even want to handle their own business

17:47.640 --> 17:54.420
until you become a full-blooded professional writer with a track record, as I said before.

17:55.100 --> 18:03.680
Most of your job is writing your magazine stuff, sending it out, and developing a magazine market.

18:04.740 --> 18:10.820
But once you begin selling, unless you really understand contractual language,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.360
then you're going to need an agent to interpret it for you.

18:18.160 --> 18:26.220
Also, most authors are not as objective about their work as an agent can be,

18:26.540 --> 18:31.480
and therefore they either demand too much or too little when they negotiate a contract.

18:31.700 --> 18:39.400
So an agent can help put things in perspective and can talk both publishers and authors into being reasonable.

18:40.220 --> 18:47.100
Agents can also exploit subsidiary rights that authors are only dimly aware of,

18:47.560 --> 18:57.940
and agents finally are able to help build an author's career by spotting that author's strengths and weaknesses,

18:58.340 --> 19:05.700
and building, of course, on the strengths and developing their talents to the utmost.

19:05.700 --> 19:15.100
There are a few authors I know, most notably Isaac Asimov, who I don't believe has agents or at least not regular agents,

19:15.740 --> 19:21.940
and Isaac certainly has done okay for himself, although I think there are probably five dozen agents who have said to him,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.940
think how well you would have done if you'd have an agent.

19:25.940 --> 19:36.380
But most authors sooner or later feel that it is well worth the commission and other things to have somebody,

19:37.020 --> 19:43.020
particularly when you don't live in the New York area, which is the heart of the publishing world.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.120
You live in California or Nebraska or something like that.

19:47.860 --> 19:51.520
There's nothing so frightening as to be out of touch with a publisher

19:51.520 --> 19:56.060
and not having anybody that you can call to act on your behalf.

19:58.140 --> 19:59.680
Okay, a more personal question.

20:00.980 --> 20:04.460
Your book, How to Be Your Own Literary Agent, of course I haven't seen that yet,

20:04.540 --> 20:06.540
but are you trying to put yourself out of business with that?

20:07.080 --> 20:11.040
I don't think I will for the reasons that I just told you.

20:11.920 --> 20:24.540
The title may not be exactly accurate because although it is designed to help new authors get a foot in the door

20:24.540 --> 20:32.900
that they might not otherwise have, it's also aimed at the professional author who may have an agent

20:32.900 --> 20:42.300
who may be of the kind who simply signs on the dotted line when his agent sticks a contract under his nose.

20:43.200 --> 20:50.560
And those authors, I think, are usually the ones who end up discovering a couple of years down the road

20:50.560 --> 20:53.360
that they made a horrible mistake when they signed that contract.

20:53.800 --> 20:58.320
And why didn't their agent tell them about certain things?

20:58.320 --> 21:06.080
And so my feeling is that an enlightened author is probably an agent's best friend,

21:06.480 --> 21:09.640
whether he's represented by an agent or not.

21:10.020 --> 21:16.840
The more that an author knows about contracts and related subjects,

21:17.620 --> 21:20.580
the tougher he's going to be in dealing with the publishers

21:20.580 --> 21:28.060
and the more he's going to benefit the entire fraternity and sorority of authors in this country

21:28.060 --> 21:29.600
and make an agent's job easier.

21:29.880 --> 21:38.020
So I don't feel that I've contradicted myself by publishing a book called How to Be Your Own Literary Agent.

21:39.920 --> 21:44.020
Okay, as the title indicates then, that really is a how-to book.

21:44.700 --> 21:49.380
Well, it does tell you, for instance, if you're a new author,

21:49.380 --> 21:59.060
it tells you what genres are the rightfulest ones to buy your work,

21:59.880 --> 22:04.420
how to write for them, how to package your work for them,

22:04.680 --> 22:10.160
how to get your work on the desk of an editor and avoid the so-called flush pile.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.420
It tells you what to do if you should get an offer.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.560
It tells you how to negotiate on your own.

22:17.560 --> 22:24.500
It tells you how to oversee what your agent is doing if you should decide to turn your work over to an agent.

22:24.660 --> 22:27.420
It tells you how to hire and fire an agent.

22:28.220 --> 22:34.020
And it completely analyzes publishing contracts from start to finish

22:34.780 --> 22:43.980
and interprets each clause in a way that any author can certainly get an advantage by studying my suggestions.

22:46.820 --> 22:51.300
So really, I guess even the beginner would get some good out of the book.

22:51.520 --> 22:51.940
Absolutely.

22:53.980 --> 22:55.600
Okay, good. When will that be out again?

22:57.000 --> 23:04.980
Let's see. Today is the 15th. Three days is the official publication date. February 18th.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.060
Okay, very good.

23:08.440 --> 23:13.700
It's already created something of a controversy in New York

23:13.700 --> 23:26.560
because one of the chapters in the book is a somewhat outspoken attack on publishing accounting systems.

23:28.040 --> 23:32.740
Publishers have a tendency to do what I call creative accounting,

23:32.740 --> 23:46.740
which the bottom line is that they hold hide or misguide authors as to how much in royalties they're entitled to.

23:47.840 --> 23:52.560
And a couple of days ago, the New York Times picked up on that chapter

23:52.560 --> 23:59.240
and published an article under the headline, Agent Says Publishers Achieving Authors.

23:59.240 --> 24:04.820
So we've got what I consider very healthy controversy going,

24:05.140 --> 24:11.760
and that's certainly one that every author ought to be interested in because it really is the gut issue.

24:12.600 --> 24:18.120
I know many new authors and aspiring authors, all they want to know is,

24:18.220 --> 24:23.560
who's going to publish my book and whatever they pay me, whatever advance I get is fine with me.

24:23.560 --> 24:28.460
But as they become more and more professional and experienced, they may wake up one day

24:28.460 --> 24:33.720
and realize that they're not getting everything that's owing to them because the publishers have obscured

24:35.000 --> 24:47.040
some of the royalty reporting systems that would enable and ought to get his full due.

24:47.040 --> 24:55.100
And so I've tried to dispel some of the mystery around the reading of royalty statements,

24:55.280 --> 25:02.340
so publishers, the authors can get a better idea of what is being told to them

25:02.340 --> 25:04.460
and whether any money is being hidden.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.840
Okay, and reading your columns over a period of time,

25:09.840 --> 25:18.120
I think I've caught you seeing a couple times that even with a lot of talent and even with a great manuscript,

25:19.040 --> 25:22.640
writers still may not make it because of the way the publishing industry is set up.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.940
Is that sort of a cynical attitude on your part?

25:26.140 --> 25:31.560
Well, I don't say it with any pride. I say it with a great deal of sadness.

25:34.460 --> 25:43.680
In the last couple of years, the prices of books have gone prohibitively high.

25:44.540 --> 25:51.300
A hardcover novel these days sells for anywhere from $15 to $20,

25:51.920 --> 25:57.940
and a paperback novel sells anywhere from $3 to $5 or even a little more.

26:00.040 --> 26:05.260
And the consumer, the book buyer, is shying away from the marketplace now

26:05.260 --> 26:13.180
because he seems to feel there are better ways to spend $20 or $5 even.

26:14.120 --> 26:19.020
As a result, the book sales have been dropping,

26:19.280 --> 26:23.820
and the publishers have become more and more selective as to what they buy.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.280
Unfortunately, that all gets passed down to the author.

26:30.780 --> 26:35.860
And more and more frequently in the last couple of years, I have had to turn away,

26:36.920 --> 26:40.700
as all my colleagues in the agency business have had to do.

26:41.420 --> 26:48.060
I've had to turn away a number of very good books that were well written,

26:48.060 --> 26:56.220
but didn't really fit into certain categories that I know are actively buying.

26:57.120 --> 27:02.260
And so what you end up with is a well-written book that really isn't saleable.

27:03.640 --> 27:09.900
And it can often break your heart to send a book like that back.

27:10.340 --> 27:14.920
It doesn't hurt you as much to send back a bad book as it does to send back a good one,

27:14.920 --> 27:19.360
but there's nothing guaranteeing that a good book is going to sell.

27:19.580 --> 27:24.040
And that, I would say, is possibly the major difference between publishing today

27:24.040 --> 27:26.160
and publishing 10 years ago.

27:28.220 --> 27:29.920
Okay, one more follow-up on that.

27:30.400 --> 27:34.960
Is the system, or does the system, as you describe it, lead to sort of hack writing

27:34.960 --> 27:36.820
or writing that's not very good?

27:37.620 --> 27:38.920
No, quite the contrary.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.140
I think the level of writing is getting better

27:42.280 --> 27:46.560
because publishers don't need to publish hack writing anymore

27:46.560 --> 27:48.200
when they can get so many good writers.

27:48.840 --> 27:52.140
The market has shrunk, for instance, from the paperback field,

27:52.800 --> 28:00.920
whereas about two or three years ago there were, I would say, 13 active, viable paperbacks

28:00.920 --> 28:04.240
ranging from the modest size one to the giant.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.260
Several have gone out of business,

28:07.260 --> 28:11.620
and three or four more have been absorbed into other companies,

28:12.200 --> 28:17.440
and now one can count six or seven paperback publishers' rests.

28:18.320 --> 28:24.220
And so the, you know, the clamor to be published by those houses is increasing,

28:24.680 --> 28:28.280
and so the publishers can afford to be more selective than ever before.

28:28.940 --> 28:33.800
So my feeling is that the, although I don't like to use the word hack,

28:35.100 --> 28:39.180
certainly the inferior writer is either going to have to try harder

28:39.180 --> 28:43.980
or he's going to drop out because there are just too many good writers waiting to take his place.

28:46.400 --> 28:50.320
Okay, Mr. Curtis, I have about, I want to move, I have about ten minutes left

28:50.320 --> 28:51.160
if you can spare that.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.500
I wanted to talk about some personal things about your background and your own work

28:54.500 --> 28:55.520
if you have the time for that.

28:55.680 --> 28:56.080
Absolutely.

28:58.360 --> 29:01.360
Okay, I was going to say how does one become an agent,

29:01.360 --> 29:03.000
but I guess I better ask how you became one.

29:03.740 --> 29:08.580
Well, when I think for a long time I always wanted to be a writer,

29:09.280 --> 29:15.520
and when I got out of college I discovered that there were no real jobs for writers,

29:15.520 --> 29:19.360
so I decided to get into a related field publishing.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.920
Could not find a job at a publishing company,

29:22.920 --> 29:30.080
so I finally ended up working for a leading literary agency, Scott Merida,

29:30.980 --> 29:35.580
and there I stayed for some seven or eight years, and that was my apprenticeship.

29:37.000 --> 29:43.680
And after some seven years I really did have an itch to write,

29:44.300 --> 29:51.080
and so I had been writing even while I worked for Scott Merida, so I left that firm

29:51.080 --> 29:56.440
and became a freelance writer, and of course, having been an agent,

29:56.620 --> 30:00.280
I was much better connected than most freelance writers could ever hope to be,

30:00.860 --> 30:07.120
so the transition was not as hard for me as it would be if somebody left some other job.

30:08.920 --> 30:17.640
I did a lot of magazine work, but eventually realized that the magazine market was in its twilight

30:17.640 --> 30:20.520
and began focusing on books.

30:21.160 --> 30:28.740
I wrote a lot of paperback novels and then eventually got into such areas of collaboration,

30:29.580 --> 30:31.100
books on conservation.

30:32.260 --> 30:38.600
I found that I had a forte in the area of humor, so I did a number of satirical books.

30:39.560 --> 30:44.720
I wrote just about anything that people would pay money for, and it was a very, very good grounding.

30:45.960 --> 30:53.760
And after about five years of that, a number of my old clients looked me up and asked me if I would represent them,

30:54.280 --> 31:01.580
and since I was not making a fortune as a writer in spite of the fact that to date I've had about 45 books published,

31:02.460 --> 31:08.060
I decided that perhaps I would go back into agenting, and I started my own firm.

31:08.060 --> 31:14.340
And for two or three years, I was both a writer and a literary agent,

31:14.520 --> 31:19.980
and literally I had two desks back to back with a flivel chair between them,

31:20.320 --> 31:23.760
and in the morning I would do one thing, and in the afternoon I would do another,

31:23.880 --> 31:26.880
and I would try not to let one contaminate the other.

31:27.560 --> 31:34.180
And eventually, when I discovered that I could make more money on a few phone calls as an agent,

31:34.180 --> 31:37.200
then I could for four or five months writing books.

31:37.240 --> 31:44.720
It was pretty clear to me where my career was heading, but I had not given up my writing.

31:45.580 --> 31:54.340
The column, of course, is very satisfying, and from time to time I might take a crack at a commercial novel or a nonfiction book.

31:55.400 --> 32:00.980
I get up at five or six in the morning, I'll write for an hour or so, then I'll go to work,

32:00.980 --> 32:07.760
and although an hour a day may not seem like a lot, as most professional writers will tell you,

32:08.660 --> 32:14.460
over a period of a couple of months one can write a book at an hour a day,

32:14.500 --> 32:17.260
as long as you stay with it and turn out something every day.

32:17.920 --> 32:23.360
So I do consider myself a literary agent with a side order of writing.

32:26.220 --> 32:30.260
In looking over the books that I know you've written in the past few years,

32:30.360 --> 32:35.500
it seems to me that a lot of your nonfiction books have been dealing with issues of social concern,

32:35.620 --> 32:39.020
like the nuclear lessons, the inequality of American communities, and so forth.

32:39.980 --> 32:42.260
Is that because of personal taste or because of your collaborators?

32:42.260 --> 32:52.040
Well, I take some pride in some of the work that I've done in the area of conservation.

32:54.780 --> 33:03.420
Around 1970 or so I was approached by a woman who had accumulated a great deal of quite terrifying information

33:04.420 --> 33:09.040
about the nuclear power industry, and she asked me to collaborate with her.

33:09.040 --> 33:14.200
I knew very little about it, but I did work with her,

33:15.220 --> 33:22.020
and out of that collaboration came a book that was published by Double Day called Perils of the Peaceful Atom.

33:22.740 --> 33:29.680
It was the first popular book on the dangers of nuclear power plants,

33:29.680 --> 33:40.580
and although it was supplanted later on by books published by people, authorities, scientists, and PhDs,

33:40.660 --> 33:50.280
whereas we were only laymen and women, I like to think that that book did open the door to discussion

33:50.280 --> 33:59.300
of the nuclear power issues, which finally culminated in the Three Mile Island accident years later,

33:59.740 --> 34:03.380
and I was able to say that I had told you so.

34:04.380 --> 34:08.960
Many of the things that happened were predicted in that book years earlier,

34:09.320 --> 34:11.360
and of course nobody really wanted to listen.

34:12.980 --> 34:19.580
So I have written some other books of social value, and I'm very proud of them.

34:20.860 --> 34:36.600
I'm also, if I may add, very proud as an agent to have brought into the world many books on social issues and things like that.

34:36.600 --> 34:43.420
We recently handled a magnificent first novel about the Vietnam War called The Thirteenth Valley,

34:43.820 --> 34:53.620
which went on the bestseller list, and opened the door to what I know will now be a state of Vietnam fiction.

34:54.540 --> 34:58.720
Up until that time, people had said that nobody really wanted to read about Vietnam,

34:59.280 --> 35:07.080
and so we've now enabled some fresh air to grow into the marketplace with that novel,

35:08.140 --> 35:11.140
and again, this is an accomplishment that I'm very proud of.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.600
What about your fiction, your novel?

35:18.060 --> 35:21.700
Can you give me an idea of what kind of things you write about, if they sell well?

35:21.700 --> 35:28.960
Well, a couple years ago, while I was still, well, more than that, about a decade ago,

35:32.740 --> 35:40.880
I conceived a paperback series featuring a hero that I always thought was rather unusual.

35:41.640 --> 35:49.060
He was a detective in the area of sports, and a series of books featuring this hero

35:49.060 --> 35:56.940
was, the series was called The Pro, and the books were published by Warner.

35:57.680 --> 36:06.140
We did four of those, and at the moment I'm trying to revive that series or something along those lines,

36:06.140 --> 36:12.980
because right now, although there's a great deal of male action-adventure fiction being published,

36:13.960 --> 36:18.100
everybody's getting bored with the same old heroes, the mercenaries, the dirty dozens,

36:21.080 --> 36:30.100
and series like that, and so I'm trying to get revived, this hero that I think is a rather refreshing one,

36:30.560 --> 36:35.600
but I'm not able to do too much in the fiction area simply because of time.

36:38.420 --> 36:40.180
Okay, I just have a couple more here.

36:41.260 --> 36:47.160
I remember reading one of your columns where you mentioned, I guess it was an innovation on your part as an agent,

36:47.260 --> 36:51.520
where you contracted with a publicity firm for your clients and so forth.

36:51.680 --> 36:55.800
I wondered if you've, things like that that you've done for your clients,

36:55.880 --> 36:59.360
it might be a little different or innovative or whatever?

36:59.360 --> 37:11.420
Well, every agent, of course, is trying to seek a better way to handle his clients and more advantages for his clients,

37:11.520 --> 37:23.380
and one of the things that upsets me deeply is the fact that publishers are very reluctant to spend promotional money

37:23.380 --> 37:28.040
on any authors except the big name celebrity authors,

37:29.280 --> 37:42.860
and so I attempted, a couple of years ago, to rectify that by asking my clients in effect to chip in.

37:43.600 --> 37:49.880
Each one of them would be, in effect, taxed a couple of extra percentage points of commission,

37:49.880 --> 38:00.700
and that tax would go towards a fund which we used to hire a publicity agent who would publicize the little guy.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.600
And some of the campaigns were quite successful.

38:06.660 --> 38:10.560
Some aspects of the campaign were not so successful,

38:11.100 --> 38:17.060
and it was because of the inconsistency of the results that we finally dropped the program,

38:17.060 --> 38:25.500
but some of it has had lasting results and certainly created a lot of talk in the industry and among authors.

38:26.780 --> 38:34.220
And it was, I thought, a noble experiment in the area of getting the lesser known authors publicized,

38:34.600 --> 38:36.360
but it's still difficult.

38:36.740 --> 38:41.900
The market inclines towards the big name,

38:41.900 --> 38:49.780
and the struggle to become a big name is extremely intense, and very, very few people emerge.

38:54.060 --> 38:58.280
Okay, what about movie deals for books that are worthy of it?

38:58.340 --> 39:01.160
Do you actively seek the matter? Do movie houses come to you?

39:01.160 --> 39:02.800
Well, it's a combination.

39:05.020 --> 39:09.740
Most books that are published, that are of any value at all,

39:10.260 --> 39:25.780
are covered by the movie studios, producers, and the people in New York whose job it is to scout on behalf of various Hollywood interests.

39:25.780 --> 39:31.800
So the chances are that if you have any, if an agent is handling a good book at all,

39:32.440 --> 39:41.380
it will have been seen in one way or another by producers, directors, studio people, and so forth.

39:41.520 --> 39:48.360
They have amazing ways of getting hold of manuscripts no matter how secretive you try to be.

39:48.360 --> 39:53.940
And so, wrong before you're ready to show them, they've already been exposed.

39:55.760 --> 40:01.300
Nevertheless, if we get a hot manuscript that we really think is going to make a terrific book,

40:01.820 --> 40:10.940
we actively try to find a movie producer for it, and so sometimes the deals come to us, and sometimes we generate them.

40:14.780 --> 40:18.920
Okay, that's about, I mean, there's lots of questions. I could keep on talking for a long time,

40:18.980 --> 40:21.260
but I think we have enough, and we've taken enough of your time.

40:21.800 --> 40:28.000
But listen, is there anything I haven't asked that you think listeners should know,

40:28.100 --> 40:31.680
or anything at all that you'd like to talk about, or we still have some tape left?

40:34.780 --> 40:39.300
No, we're happy to answer any other questions you may have.

40:40.300 --> 40:45.060
I will say that we were talking about innovations before.

40:45.960 --> 40:56.380
I may be springing a very radical proposition on the publishing industry that I believe will create a lot of talk and controversy,

40:56.560 --> 41:05.280
and I'm not doing it just to publicize myself, but I've begun to, because of my deep concern about royalty accounting

41:06.020 --> 41:14.120
and how publishers have managed to manipulate and hide author's royalties,

41:14.660 --> 41:22.560
I'm going to be making a proposal to the publishing industry about a radically different way of accounting royalties,

41:22.820 --> 41:30.480
based not on sales, but on copies printed, and I would say that within the next few months

41:31.400 --> 41:41.900
you might begin looking for some stirring in that area, and I believe it could have some rather radical effects

41:41.900 --> 41:46.880
on the way people think about the traditional way of accounting royalties.

41:48.220 --> 41:54.780
I remember some of your calls, I think you sort of hinted at certain things about the way the publishers did that.

41:54.780 --> 42:01.700
Right, well I actually do suggest something like it in my book, but I will now be amplifying on it,

42:01.740 --> 42:09.580
and if I can get some of the publishing media to pick up on these suggestions,

42:09.660 --> 42:17.500
it should make for a very, very lively dialogue, and certainly one that's well over do in this 18th century business we call publishing.

42:18.980 --> 42:23.820
I take it then in the three-part relationship here, a writer, an agent, and a publisher,

42:24.120 --> 42:26.680
that you would say probably the publisher has much the best of it?

42:27.400 --> 42:35.260
No, I don't think so at all. I've heard everybody accuse everybody else of having the best of it.

42:35.940 --> 42:42.320
There are rich agents, there are agents who are struggling, there are rich authors and authors who are struggling,

42:42.480 --> 42:44.860
and there are rich publishers and there are publishers who are struggling.

42:46.840 --> 42:55.880
I, in spite of some of the belligerent things I may have said, I have a great, great many friends among the publishers,

42:56.180 --> 43:07.780
and I want to see them do well, and so I've come to think of it as a symbiotic environment in which everybody really does depend on everybody else.

43:08.960 --> 43:21.740
And an agent's job is not just to negotiate contracts, but to negotiate interests so that nobody gets so badly hurt that he can't carry on.

43:22.980 --> 43:34.900
I mean, publishers are always complaining about their overhead, and it's well to rebuy them that agents have to pay their rent also,

43:34.900 --> 43:49.000
but some agents get very greedy and they feel that the only way for an author to become famous is to pin the publisher to the wall with a cruel deal,

43:49.420 --> 44:02.560
and sometimes they can backfire in terms of how much money is left after you've hit a publisher that hard, how much money is left for the struggling author.

44:02.560 --> 44:17.620
The paperback publisher that consistently pays two or three million dollars for one or two authors is going to find himself neglecting the new author because he can't afford to pay him,

44:17.640 --> 44:25.180
or if he should buy a new author's work he won't have any money left to publicize or promote that author's book.

44:25.180 --> 44:37.460
So there's something even to be said for not being greedy on behalf of your authors and giving the publisher an even break.

44:40.060 --> 44:45.360
Okay, very good. Okay, listen, we're going to turn off the recorder now. We're just about to tape any...
