00:01.220 --> 00:02.860
Hi Ed, how are you doing this morning?

00:03.860 --> 00:05.900
Oh, very good thank you.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.060
I am just testing fine.

00:10.860 --> 00:14.160
If this thing starts clicking, you'll see me come over there and buy a ton of copies.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.820
And where's my cough button?

00:20.540 --> 00:25.880
Okay, first of all I'll ask you what's your definition of science fiction?

00:27.140 --> 00:29.840
My definition of science fiction is pretty vague.

00:30.860 --> 00:36.760
Aside from weaseling out of the definition, which I ordinarily do when people ask me that

00:36.760 --> 00:41.320
because I keep pointing out all the exceptions that can be made to almost any definition,

00:41.960 --> 00:48.240
I finally get backed around into a corner where I suggest that first of all, science fiction

00:48.240 --> 00:50.220
is essentially the same as any other fiction.

00:50.440 --> 00:55.160
It's fiction about people, about characters, about the relationships between one character

00:55.160 --> 01:01.840
and another or one character in a group, which may be society, with the difference from mainstream

01:01.840 --> 01:07.320
fiction being that in science fiction there is some sort of scientific or technological development

01:07.320 --> 01:14.200
which is important to the story and which affects those human relationships between person

01:14.200 --> 01:18.640
and other person or person and people as a group.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.700
Okay, you're a science fiction writer.

01:24.980 --> 01:29.860
What occurred in your background to point you in the direction of A being a writer and B

01:29.860 --> 01:33.160
being a science fiction writer as opposed to something else, some of the genre?

01:34.860 --> 01:45.540
I think probably growing up as an alien in an alien land, my family reared me in rural Wyoming.

01:45.540 --> 01:53.720
I was a product of a ranch background and in this environment, I didn't have any younger brothers

01:53.720 --> 01:56.380
or sisters who are anywhere close to my age.

01:56.840 --> 02:03.100
I didn't have any neighbor kids to play with so I had to learn to amuse myself for a good many years.

02:04.060 --> 02:09.280
I also didn't particularly like living in the rural west and so I sought escape

02:09.280 --> 02:14.560
and these things coalesced into reading a lot of science fiction and fantasy

02:14.560 --> 02:20.900
and I suspect that because of this ill spent background as a kid that when I started writing

02:20.900 --> 02:25.880
I naturally tended to write the sorts of things that I'd read so often.

02:26.380 --> 02:31.740
By no means did I read only science fiction or fantasy and a case could be made for

02:31.740 --> 02:36.360
why didn't I write sea stories or dog stories or biographies of American heroes

02:36.360 --> 02:40.360
but still science fiction and fantasy had been in the ascendancy

02:40.360 --> 02:44.440
and so that's what I started writing.

02:45.880 --> 02:51.320
You grew up in the Sputnik era as I did and it influenced me a lot.

02:52.220 --> 02:59.140
What I later became, were you influenced by those heady days of the space race and science and that sort of thing?

02:59.880 --> 03:06.100
It's a terrible thing to admit but unlike when John F. Kennedy died

03:06.100 --> 03:11.580
which is one test of anyone who was of thinking age in 1963

03:12.100 --> 03:16.540
I cannot remember in 1957 what I was doing when I heard about Sputnik

03:17.620 --> 03:22.440
almost anyone else who is my age who is writing or reading science fiction

03:22.440 --> 03:27.900
can remember exactly what they were doing and how they felt when the Russian satellite went up.

03:28.580 --> 03:31.720
I have blanked it completely out of my history.

03:31.720 --> 03:37.100
It's possible that I connected with some horrible incident in my childhood and that's why I can't recall it.

03:38.620 --> 03:44.900
At the same time certainly the Sputnik inspired influence on American education

03:45.660 --> 03:50.240
is something that I can remember because it must have been about that time

03:50.240 --> 03:58.640
that people in my school as in schools everywhere else around America were urging me to get into some sort of scientific or technical career

03:58.640 --> 04:07.300
and this was probably the first step in the process that led to my taking up an aerospace engineering major in college

04:07.300 --> 04:16.220
which was something that I soon junked but at the time I found myself in that sort of technically oriented program

04:16.220 --> 04:24.560
which I had simply never questioned because at that time, that place, I was in a culture specifically Southern Wyoming

04:24.560 --> 04:29.800
which said that if I were college bound and male, I would end up being an engineer and that was that

04:29.800 --> 04:38.140
and there were no other alternatives. God knows, no one was supposed to end up going into say writing for a career that was unheard of.

04:41.980 --> 04:47.600
Your clarion product, how much influence did this have on your career, this clarion background?

04:47.600 --> 04:59.300
It had an incalculable effect or maybe it is calculable in the sense that I probably, quite possibly wouldn't have a professional writing career

04:59.300 --> 05:07.660
had it not been for clarion. I went to the first of the clarion workshops in the summer of 1967, 68.

05:09.060 --> 05:18.960
I think I am getting to be senile. I went to the first clarion workshop in 1968 and of course there was no pre-existing clarion mystique.

05:19.160 --> 05:28.540
That was the first one. I went because I was bored with having gone through five straight years of undergraduate and graduate work.

05:28.900 --> 05:33.680
I didn't know what I was going to be when I grew up, certainly not what I was going to be when I got out of graduate school.

05:33.680 --> 05:42.640
I was being programmed once again this time to handle six composition courses in a junior college, something like that.

05:43.460 --> 05:48.680
So at clarion I met for the first time working writers. This had never happened before.

05:49.100 --> 05:54.500
I didn't know what professional writing was all about. All I knew was that like most of the other people at the workshop

05:54.500 --> 06:00.300
I had been a real hotshot in college writing courses and in English classes in high school

06:00.300 --> 06:05.320
and I had no idea exactly how bad a writer I actually was.

06:05.640 --> 06:13.820
So I had the opportunity to meet very rigorous critics such as Judith Merrill or Kate Wilhelm or Damon Knight

06:13.820 --> 06:18.920
and met for the first time such people as Fritz Leiber and Robin Wilson and Harlan Ellison.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.920
And this was an incredible illumination for me.

06:22.920 --> 06:29.940
I got to find out what people who actually got their stories and their books published were like, how they did it.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.760
I had had no conception of the professional side of writing.

06:35.600 --> 06:43.380
And again this was revelatory to me. But most of all I was up against people who knew what writing was about

06:43.380 --> 06:48.640
and who could read my work and tell me how incredibly awful it was.

06:48.640 --> 06:59.580
But more important than that to tell me what I was doing wrong and extend some of the possibilities that I could try for trying to improve my work.

07:00.720 --> 07:10.620
The information I have indicates that pretty soon after Clarion, Harlan Ellison was your mentor or some word.

07:12.440 --> 07:17.540
Did this also have a positive influence on your career? Would you be where you are today without that?

07:19.020 --> 07:25.680
I might or might not be. I don't know. I wouldn't be as far along in my career had that not happened.

07:26.260 --> 07:37.480
What actually happened at Clarion was I had the dubious distinction of writing the first story by any Clarion writer that was accepted for professional publication.

07:38.260 --> 07:45.060
And that was simply because during the week that Harlan was the guest writer, I wrote a from scratch story.

07:45.060 --> 07:51.600
All my other stories had been rewrites of stories I'd done for college classes and had been uniformly trashed by everyone present.

07:51.920 --> 08:01.100
Then I did a completely original story at the next week presented to Harlan who then turned around and bought it as one of the first couple of stories

08:01.100 --> 08:05.660
he was purchasing for the again dangerous visions anthologies anthology.

08:07.520 --> 08:16.260
And this had a great positive reinforcement because I was getting $150 in pre-inflation, $1968.

08:17.160 --> 08:24.280
I had the ego boost of knowing that my story was going to be in a book which would be in bookstores, non-library shelves.

08:24.500 --> 08:29.160
And of course immediately I had the fantasy that this was going to become a major motion picture.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.940
There'd be a spin-off series. There'd be serialized in McCalls and so forth and so on.

08:32.940 --> 08:36.520
I'd be on the Dick Cavett show and the Tomorrow Show and Tonight Show this morning show.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.460
But of course it didn't happen that way.

08:40.080 --> 08:45.600
But at the same time Harlan was responsible for my first professional sale.

08:46.160 --> 08:54.460
After that as our relationship extended and not only was my editor but he became a close personal friend as well,

08:55.140 --> 09:02.360
I took up his invitation to visit in Southern California and encountered yet another alien culture that I wasn't used to.

09:03.420 --> 09:10.340
And I was a peculiar sort of apprenticeship and I don't think apprenticeship is so far off as a term.

09:10.820 --> 09:16.640
I got to observe Harlan's professional life. I saw how he functioned as a writer.

09:17.020 --> 09:23.160
I got to see through Harlan how other writers functioned each in his or her own way as a writer.

09:24.080 --> 09:29.080
But particularly with Harlan I got to see again that professional side of writing.

09:29.080 --> 09:38.760
I got to see how Harlan coped with agents, editors, script editors, publishers, art directors and so forth and so on.

09:39.400 --> 09:51.260
And it was very, very important to me to learn such things from Harlan as ways I could pursue to safeguard the integrity of my work

09:51.260 --> 09:55.860
from the point it left my typewriter to the point at which it appeared in print on the page.

09:57.280 --> 10:04.700
The collaboration with Ellison which came out as Phoenix Without Ash has must have taught you a lot about how you interact

10:04.700 --> 10:09.820
and preserve the integrity of work with the studio. How did that collaboration work?

10:12.120 --> 10:18.860
I got a call from Harlan one day saying, I'd already known about the series The Star Lost that he was going to do.

10:18.860 --> 10:29.480
It was a syndicated, videotaped science fiction series, at first a mini series that was to be done with joint U.S. Canadian participation

10:29.480 --> 10:35.240
and taped in Toronto. And it sounded like a great idea. This was going to be an adult television series.

10:35.940 --> 10:44.360
So Harlan contacted me saying that he would like to see a novel written based on his pilot script for the series.

10:44.360 --> 10:53.660
And this of course was before the series started to be subverted by the various elements that finally caused Harlan to pull out his name

10:53.660 --> 11:01.100
and his participation from the show and to condemn the program in print before it actually ever went on the air.

11:02.540 --> 11:09.600
And he simply offered me the opportunity to write a book based on the first script with an amazing amount of freedom.

11:09.600 --> 11:17.800
He said that he trusted me. He trusted me professionally. And therefore, since after all, the script was only 62 pages long

11:17.800 --> 11:22.620
and I was expected to come up with something like 260 pages of manuscript for the novel itself.

11:23.340 --> 11:32.660
I had carte blanche as far as developing new subsidiary characters, subplots, expanding on the existing characters and plots.

11:33.380 --> 11:39.680
Essentially, I could do whatever I wanted to as long as I remained true to the spirit of what Harlan had already done.

11:40.740 --> 11:48.960
And I immediately was seized with an overwhelming sense of responsibility that caused me to stop writing altogether

11:49.760 --> 11:57.520
until I was very close to the deadline for this book. And then I essentially did the work in something like three weeks.

11:58.040 --> 12:06.200
Now, when I was done with the manuscript and shipped it off to Harlan, I waited with a great deal of apprehension to see how the man was going to react.

12:07.260 --> 12:13.260
And we actually didn't have a whole lot to quarrel about. Harlan was essentially happy with what I'd done.

12:13.820 --> 12:22.840
There was only one major plot thing that he took issue about. And that was I had decided to have the heroine loser virginity in this book.

12:23.400 --> 12:29.440
Harlan argued with this saying that he had this great scene plan for her to lose her virginity in the second book in the series.

12:30.260 --> 12:42.200
So not wanting to waste work, how can I put this delicately, I simply rewrote my scene so that it was basically all there except that she did not lose her virginity at the end.

12:43.120 --> 12:49.200
Harlan had his plot machination, I was still able to keep what I thought was a decent scene.

12:49.200 --> 12:57.760
Unfortunately, the second novel in the series, and Harlan and I had planned out three, has never been written and so has never appeared.

12:58.060 --> 13:03.920
And naturally, neither has the third. There is that possibility, but Harlan stays very, very busy.

13:04.880 --> 13:09.160
And the opportunity simply hasn't come up to do any of the other books in the series.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.240
So it's just a heavy padding scene instead of a...

13:13.240 --> 13:14.880
It's a frustrating scene.

13:16.020 --> 13:19.180
It looks like she already gained her virginity a long while.

13:19.580 --> 13:20.420
A long while.

13:21.660 --> 13:31.920
Okay, now we get sticky. Okay. Other than that collaboration you have written and sold to the public only short stories.

13:32.220 --> 13:35.500
Why do you work in the short story medium as opposed to a novel medium?

13:35.940 --> 13:41.600
It's not a matter of conscious choice. I write what I do because that is what I do.

13:43.440 --> 13:48.320
I plan to write novels. Of course, I've been planning to write novels for a long time.

13:48.740 --> 13:56.480
My publisher is expecting by October 1st a novel which was originally contracted in 1974.

13:57.620 --> 14:01.500
And this is a long while to be dithering about completing the book.

14:05.040 --> 14:10.280
Short stories for whatever reason, and I can't consciously point them out.

14:10.280 --> 14:18.220
I can't point out the why have just always seemed to me the appropriate medium that I should work in.

14:19.240 --> 14:26.560
In some ways, to degree, I feel like short stories are mini novels

14:27.640 --> 14:34.640
because I have often spent much more time in terms of working out the characterizations,

14:34.640 --> 14:36.960
the plots and so forth and so on.

14:37.660 --> 14:43.540
Then the amount of space in that short story would indicate.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.220
And there are stories of mine that seem to me to be almost compressed novels

14:51.220 --> 14:55.100
that under other circumstances were I more a prolific writer.

14:55.300 --> 15:03.460
I probably could have expanded them out another 54,000 words and got a nice paperback original novel.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.580
But I like to work with the compression sometimes.

15:08.960 --> 15:12.820
I like to pack an incredible amount, which is a risk of course

15:12.820 --> 15:24.820
because I fully recognize that a lot of people who read my stuff don't care to deal in that sort of thing.

15:25.320 --> 15:30.000
They don't want to have to worry about putting that kind of energy into reading a short story

15:30.000 --> 15:34.620
that they might ordinarily apply to at least starting to approach a novel.

15:36.820 --> 15:39.380
Are you familiar with the MacArthur Prize?

15:40.420 --> 15:43.920
They just select people of great promise.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.580
Oh yeah, right.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.340
Scenario, you get a knock on the door one day and they say,

15:50.400 --> 15:54.780
Ed, you're going to get $100,000 a year tax-free every year for life.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.380
Would you write a novel?

15:58.380 --> 16:04.740
Is the urge to write a novel commercially induced or is it bubbling in there and you got to write it?

16:05.860 --> 16:08.620
I think it's probably the second.

16:10.840 --> 16:15.860
I can imagine myself getting $100,000 a year for life, something like that,

16:16.160 --> 16:20.580
and just becoming a parasite, spending the rest of my life in enforced idleness,

16:20.700 --> 16:23.300
and not only not writing novels but also not writing short stories.

16:24.060 --> 16:25.500
I hope that wouldn't happen.

16:25.500 --> 16:31.940
That's a parallel to the question about what would you do on a desert island

16:32.360 --> 16:36.860
if you had the bottles to put the manuscript in and ship them off into the water

16:36.860 --> 16:41.560
and if you had the paper and so forth and so on, but you had no guarantee that anyone would read your manuscript, would you still write?

16:42.140 --> 16:47.000
It's a great parlor game and I think that I'm being honest when I say,

16:47.040 --> 16:52.360
yeah, sure, I'd continue writing but I wouldn't know for certain until I'd actually tried it.

16:52.360 --> 16:57.600
And with the matter of my income being provided,

16:58.220 --> 17:03.340
I think I really believe that there are things that I want to write about

17:03.340 --> 17:11.360
that I can treat much better as novels but I can't have short stories and I think I would do that.

17:11.740 --> 17:19.460
I think right now the bottleneck factor is that I haven't done a scratch novel that's worked.

17:19.460 --> 17:22.200
I've done Phoenix which is a novelization.

17:22.500 --> 17:29.620
I've done Cinnabar which is a sort of piece work novel made up of parts that were originally published as short stories.

17:30.180 --> 17:38.360
And I've done a 60,000 word novel which remains in my files, has never been rewritten, has never been submitted professionally,

17:38.720 --> 17:40.160
is not science fiction or fantasy.

17:40.540 --> 17:45.200
It's the traditional college novel that editors know and abominate.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.680
They get thousands of them every year.

17:47.680 --> 17:53.180
They're the novels that people write just after college in which the young writer says,

17:53.260 --> 17:58.520
well, I have come of age in this society and here are the wonderful truths that I have learned

17:58.520 --> 18:03.380
and they put all this into fiction and it's usually just pretty terrible stuff.

18:07.340 --> 18:08.380
Cinnabar came out.

18:08.820 --> 18:13.560
I picked it up because the science fiction review monthly said, let's see, have the quote,

18:13.560 --> 18:17.280
imagine the dying earth written by Moorcock at his very best.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.100
Couldn't have written the word better myself.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.420
That was a good idea. I gotta read this.

18:24.120 --> 18:29.100
Give me a little bit of background how these stories evolved, what you had pictured

18:29.100 --> 18:32.780
and how they developed that sort of thing with this group of stories.

18:33.400 --> 18:33.620
Right.

18:33.620 --> 18:44.620
Well, no matter what the short story or a novel and no matter how complex the ultimate product might be,

18:44.660 --> 18:49.960
originally there always is the single image somewhere along the line that everything else generated from.

18:50.580 --> 18:55.300
In the case of Cinnabar, I suppose the overriding image is the city itself,

18:56.120 --> 19:00.800
the city that exists presumably millions of years in our future

19:00.800 --> 19:03.420
and may or may not exist here on earth.

19:03.660 --> 19:07.840
That's never really spelled out nor did I feel it important to do so.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.020
Although I suspect to pin down, I would suggest that Cinnabar is probably very close to Phoenix, Arizona.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.720
I shouldn't be surprised.

19:18.400 --> 19:27.880
But in the late 1960s, I just had the image of the far future, very colorful, emerald city of Oz,

19:27.880 --> 19:32.000
sort of apparition wavering out there on the desert horizon.

19:32.620 --> 19:40.280
And of course, once the image was there, then all the questions of both fiction in general and science fiction in particular

19:40.280 --> 19:46.700
generated such as, okay, what is that city all about? Who lives there? What do they do?

19:47.600 --> 19:58.940
I wanted to write about a city of such sophistication and decadence that science and technology, as Arthur C. Clarke put it in a different context,

19:59.300 --> 20:01.220
might as well be magic.

20:02.400 --> 20:10.400
And I wanted to, in terms of the human element, investigate what would people do with their access to immortality,

20:10.400 --> 20:13.760
with their access to technological powers beyond compare?

20:14.640 --> 20:19.780
Would their lives be any less screwed up than they are now in 20th century America or not?

20:20.300 --> 20:29.040
So again, I was going back to that original premise that I believe in, that good fiction is about people and their relationships.

20:29.820 --> 20:38.020
And if you have access to physical immortality, for example, how does this affect your relationship with the people that are closest to you

20:38.020 --> 20:40.720
and the people that you interact with every day on the street?

20:41.920 --> 20:45.360
And that's what Cinnabar finally is all about.

20:45.920 --> 20:56.760
And it came as a great surprise to me as I wrote these stories about that fabulous city, that there was an all over structure

20:56.760 --> 21:00.180
that seemed to be coming out independent of each individual story.

21:00.180 --> 21:09.220
And that's why when you read the stories altogether in a book, I feel there is a clear cut beginning and a clear cut ending

21:09.220 --> 21:18.500
and there is a progress made through the stories almost as though one were reading a from scratch novel,

21:18.700 --> 21:20.340
even though of course it isn't.

21:22.620 --> 21:27.460
I weasel a lot with the definition of what is a novel there and what isn't.

21:27.460 --> 21:32.560
But still the background is the same from story to story.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.520
Most of the characters are the same from story to story.

21:37.820 --> 21:43.520
The image of the city and not the characters is what developed first.

21:43.840 --> 21:44.020
Yes.

21:44.280 --> 21:44.520
Okay.

21:44.860 --> 21:45.140
Yes.

21:45.560 --> 21:49.100
The characters are quite memorable and the names are intriguing too.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.460
Did those just surface?

21:52.080 --> 21:55.200
Did you have to work hard to develop these characters?

21:56.660 --> 22:05.860
Oh, unlike Isaac Asimov, I don't keep incredibly detailed journals of every hour of every day of my life.

22:06.060 --> 22:12.420
And probably I should because I have, for example, I have a vague memory with one of the primary characters in Cinnabar,

22:12.580 --> 22:18.920
Tourmaline Hayes, the network star, that her name was originally something else, some other gemstone.

22:19.740 --> 22:25.720
And I seem to recall doodling on a piece of paper, things like, let's see,

22:25.940 --> 22:33.860
Sapphire Hayes, Emerald Hayes, Ruby Hayes and so forth and so on, until finally I came up with Tourmaline.

22:36.520 --> 22:48.900
But why I picked that particular name, for example, with that particular character, I can't tell you now.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.960
I don't know if it's a generation of a character, trait, a name or whatever.

22:54.600 --> 22:58.300
I know that there was a certain amount of floundering around at the time.

22:58.480 --> 23:07.380
Of course, now the city title, strangely enough, came originally from a photograph of a horse.

23:08.820 --> 23:16.500
My mother, in her living room, has a beautiful photograph of the head of a palomino.

23:17.800 --> 23:24.280
This was a picture she told me about when I was growing up, because this was the horse that she used to ride in the summers

23:24.280 --> 23:27.680
out at a dood ranch in Upstate New York called the Cinnabar.

23:29.020 --> 23:31.740
And I'd always loved the sound of the word.

23:32.600 --> 23:39.160
It conjured up all sorts of images for me that I think went far beyond your standard Upstate New York dood ranch.

23:39.160 --> 23:47.780
And then later on I found out that the Cinnabar, one summer in the late 1930s, was where my father and mother had met.

23:48.340 --> 23:55.480
The romance that led to their marriage and my consequent existence as a human being had all come from that.

23:56.420 --> 24:01.200
But originally there was that image of the palomino there on the wall at the Cinnabar,

24:01.300 --> 24:06.060
and that was the first time I knew about the city and that was the first time I started speculating about it.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.140
That's her title.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.800
So that's her kingdom.

24:13.200 --> 24:13.480
Okay.

24:14.420 --> 24:24.020
In the acknowledgments in Cinnabar, you mentioned Joan Bernat, who pioneered in the writing of Cinnabar's stories.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.300
I'm not familiar with her.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.880
What kind of stories did she write or what did she do that inspired her?

24:32.920 --> 24:37.620
Joan Bernat was a very good writer at the early Clarion workshop.

24:42.120 --> 24:47.620
Joan Bernat was a very good writer who did a number of stories at the early Clarion workshops,

24:47.820 --> 24:51.820
which were published in various anthologies and I have no idea where she is now.

24:52.800 --> 24:59.620
But at one point in the workshop we'd done an exercise in which each of us came up with various narrative hooks,

25:00.020 --> 25:04.700
first lines of stories which were calculated to catch the interest of the reader.

25:05.380 --> 25:10.720
And I had done a story hook which went along the lines of,

25:11.300 --> 25:16.600
oh, I think the road to Cinnabar was lined with the shells of burnt out school buses.

25:17.900 --> 25:24.340
And I had no particular reason for coming up with this line other than to me it was interesting

25:24.340 --> 25:28.760
and also this was vaguely tied in with my image of Cinnabar the city.

25:28.760 --> 25:35.020
Well, a number of people in the workshop borrowed other people's narrative hooks and wrote stories around them.

25:35.040 --> 25:42.180
And Joan Bernat actually did the first Cinnabar story in the sense that she wrote a story which started with that line.

25:43.700 --> 25:49.440
And her Cinnabar was not quite the same as mine, but still there was something of the feeling about it,

25:49.620 --> 25:54.120
the almost surrealistic image of the city wavering on the horizon,

25:54.120 --> 25:57.860
the city which is totally cut off from the entire rest of the world.

25:58.040 --> 26:01.480
In fact, for all intents and purposes is the entire world.

26:02.260 --> 26:06.320
And so that's why Joan Bernat got the acknowledgement at the beginning of the book

26:06.320 --> 26:12.200
because in that sense she did do the pioneering effort and did write the first Cinnabar story.

26:12.640 --> 26:17.660
As far as I know that story has never been published and out of a sense of nostalgia

26:17.660 --> 26:26.860
I would like to get my hands on a copy of the manuscript to see if the story is anything like I remember it from those summer days in 1968.

26:27.740 --> 26:31.740
Have you ever considered writing any more Cinnabar stories, will we see any more?

26:32.040 --> 26:40.920
I've thought about it. I have notes on several Cinnabar stories including the possibility of doing five novelettes

26:40.920 --> 26:47.460
which would come together as another make-up novel about the character Jade Blue.

26:48.780 --> 26:53.120
I have never completed any of these stories and perhaps I never will.

26:53.360 --> 27:01.120
My publisher and I would like to do a new edition of Cinnabar with a brand new Cinnabar story in it.

27:01.660 --> 27:06.000
But I don't know, I just haven't been able to do a Cinnabar story.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.880
It may be that its time has passed in terms of my own professional nature.

27:14.360 --> 27:19.960
The Cinnabar stories that I've got planned out would take place before the time of the stories in the book itself

27:19.960 --> 27:25.020
because of course at the end of the book I don't think I'm giving away any plot secrets here.

27:25.440 --> 27:34.560
Cinnabar is in the process of being destroyed and I've had no desire to write stories about Cinnabar after the fall.

27:34.560 --> 27:42.800
But before there are still possibilities I would like to do for example a story about a man in Cinnabar

27:42.800 --> 27:47.600
who comes up with the greatest decadent luxury anyone could have.

27:47.720 --> 27:53.040
I thought for a long time about what single luxury would be the most decadent,

27:53.300 --> 27:57.420
the most useless example of conspicuous affluence.

27:57.420 --> 28:07.400
And I realized of course that probably what would be comprised in that would be having your own roller coaster.

28:08.340 --> 28:12.240
I mean think how decadent to have your own roller coaster sitting out behind your house

28:12.240 --> 28:15.520
which only you use or your friends of course.

28:16.240 --> 28:22.140
And so immediately because I love roller coasters a lot started to design my own version of the ultimate roller coaster

28:22.140 --> 28:29.740
and that is going to be the central image in that particular story if it's ever written.

28:30.180 --> 28:38.880
Another Cinnabar story which is yet unwritten is what happens when Turmaline Hayes decides to have an enormous party

28:38.880 --> 28:45.440
at which she invites every single one of her old lovers of which she has quite a few.

28:45.440 --> 28:54.320
And this will simply be a party at which you have no idea whether it's going to be a romantic comedy or a murder mystery.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.320
A lot of possibilities there.

28:57.980 --> 29:01.380
The roller coaster might make for a nice book cover if they'll do it right.

29:01.560 --> 29:01.800
Indeed.

29:03.620 --> 29:11.700
Particle theory, the story, not the collection seemed a little bit unique to me because it was an analog story

29:11.700 --> 29:17.240
and it was a little more of the hard science quote unquote than we usually see in your work.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.980
Apparently this story evolved over a long period of time.

29:21.100 --> 29:21.620
Correct.

29:21.940 --> 29:22.160
Yes.

29:22.920 --> 29:23.420
Okay.

29:28.160 --> 29:31.100
Okay, I better go on for a while.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.620
Was that supposed to pick up the ball there?

29:34.320 --> 29:35.680
Say something, talk a minute.

29:36.100 --> 29:36.360
Okay.

29:38.960 --> 29:47.960
Okay, particle theory came about because I read a newspaper article about pion beam therapy using a stream of solid particles,

29:48.080 --> 29:57.000
sub-nuclear particles to attack cancerous tumors, which I have just found out is a line of research that has just been abandoned down at Los Alamos.

29:57.440 --> 30:03.940
I'm not sure why, whether it's funding cutbacks or whether they've simply found better means to attack the medical problem.

30:03.940 --> 30:11.040
But at any rate, what had intrigued me a number of years ago in the paper is now apparently scientifically dead.

30:11.940 --> 30:16.740
And yeah, this is more of a hard science story than I customarily write.

30:17.340 --> 30:30.800
But I think it exhibits a more general principle, which is that I or every other writer who may not be all that soundly based in science and technology

30:30.800 --> 30:42.800
by discipline or by vocation need simply only use the research tools that we all presumably learned in junior high to get across a hard science story

30:42.800 --> 30:46.280
without being overly didactic about it.

30:46.760 --> 30:53.300
What I discovered in this story was that the world is full of experts who were quite willing to share with me their specialized knowledge,

30:53.300 --> 31:03.500
whether it was particle beam physics or whether it was the landscape around Los Alamos and little details for various similitudes such as

31:03.500 --> 31:09.400
what airline do you fly into Los Alamos on and what sort of planes are you in and all of that kind of thing.

31:10.700 --> 31:14.480
True, ordinarily I don't use quite so much scientific content.

31:14.820 --> 31:19.020
All I can say is this was one of the stories in which that content seemed appropriate.

31:20.020 --> 31:29.040
And it exhibits my own in a sense my own sense of frustration with being typecast.

31:29.480 --> 31:42.600
I write what I like to write and sometimes that may be a story which is full of medical research about prostate cancer and particle beam therapy for that cancer

31:42.600 --> 31:46.560
and cosmology all that.

31:46.900 --> 31:54.820
And other times I will write science fiction stories in which there is not a speck of hard research or hard fact.

31:55.780 --> 32:00.940
Again I suppose it illustrates the difference between facts and truths to be facile about it.

32:02.500 --> 32:06.680
But it also shows that good research can cover a multitude of sins.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.680
In this case it simply seemed appropriate.

32:08.680 --> 32:12.340
I think this story for me is still a people story first and foremost.

32:13.080 --> 32:23.000
It's again about relationships with people and the scientific content amplifies, illustrates and I hope clarifies those relationships.

32:23.400 --> 32:28.240
But by God the people still come first and the science and technology come second.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.620
Okay we've got ten minutes.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.340
Okay I have two questions.

32:32.880 --> 32:36.840
I'll cut it to two questions when you work and then I want to mention the Labor Day group.

32:36.840 --> 32:39.340
Although I can try. I can be quicker in my answers.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.360
No no no no.

32:44.100 --> 32:48.920
My main regret in all this is that we always only have an hour or so because it gets pretty fat.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
You guys probably don't like that the week. It's interesting.

32:51.200 --> 32:56.600
Okay the story that blew me away in that collection was and I hope I get the pronunciation.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.580
The Hibakusha Gallery.

32:58.740 --> 32:58.920
Right.

32:59.440 --> 33:04.700
Okay I don't like to ask where do you get your ideas but where do you get that idea.

33:04.700 --> 33:09.080
That just...

33:09.080 --> 33:10.580
Well the Hibakusha Gallery.

33:13.820 --> 33:18.280
I'll be lying if I said that the Hibakusha Gallery didn't come from the central image.

33:18.680 --> 33:24.200
Which is the strange gallery that is presumably in a near future America.

33:25.380 --> 33:29.500
Where people come to have their pictures taken.

33:30.400 --> 33:37.720
Standing behind the cutouts of nuclear blast survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

33:38.300 --> 33:45.060
Where the faces of the original subjects of the photographs have been eliminated.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.460
And the faces of the tourists have been substituted.

33:48.960 --> 33:56.720
And of course the image goes back to the Jones Beach sort of tourist emporiums in New Jersey.

33:56.720 --> 34:01.940
On the boardwalk where you stand behind the beach bunny or the muscle builder.

34:02.380 --> 34:04.320
And your face is super imposed over there.

34:04.580 --> 34:07.240
There you get souvenir photographs.

34:07.920 --> 34:11.400
And I really can't tell you why that image came about originally.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.780
Except that was the image.

34:13.300 --> 34:16.580
The image was so incredibly powerful.

34:16.760 --> 34:19.080
I didn't know what to do with it for a long time.

34:19.680 --> 34:22.040
And I had a lot of false starts with that story.

34:22.040 --> 34:28.500
I wrote that story and rewrote that story more completely than any other story I'd done up to that time.

34:29.300 --> 34:33.840
I in some senses took two and a half years to write the story.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.160
Because I couldn't quite get it right.

34:36.320 --> 34:39.860
I kept adding all sorts of false plot elements that just didn't work out.

34:39.940 --> 34:42.980
I didn't know what to do with the materials of the story.

34:44.340 --> 34:46.980
The story certainly is not perfect now.

34:46.980 --> 34:55.460
But I finally reached a point where I felt that it was largely successful in terms of getting across what I wanted to get across.

34:56.240 --> 35:00.100
So much of writing for me seems to be unconscious.

35:01.220 --> 35:07.060
For probably the first two years of writing that story, I had no idea what the story was actually about.

35:07.060 --> 35:17.380
What I've come to believe it's about is not anything as simple as the horrors of nuclear war or anything quite that blatant.

35:17.640 --> 35:20.820
But more I realized I was dealing with something different.

35:20.980 --> 35:22.460
I was dealing with the guilt of the survivor.

35:22.920 --> 35:31.080
I was dealing with the mental set of people who have lived on through some sort of holocaust when everyone else around them has died.

35:32.740 --> 35:36.020
The obvious interpretation, well, you've been lucky.

35:36.220 --> 35:38.860
You lived when all the others around you perished.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.200
Don't you feel lucky?

35:40.220 --> 35:41.960
And of course those survivors rarely do.

35:42.360 --> 35:48.960
They go through a psychological syndrome in which they feel guilty because they lived and others died.

35:49.380 --> 35:52.420
And the question was, how does a person cope with that?

35:52.860 --> 35:56.460
And that was the problem that I was attacking in this particular story.

35:57.460 --> 36:04.420
One of the things that pleased me about the story was that it finally sold outside the science fiction community.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.560
I mean, it is a science fiction story, I suppose.

36:06.780 --> 36:08.840
It takes place in a speculative future.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.000
Yet it sold outside of science fiction.

36:11.120 --> 36:14.460
It was published in a non-science fiction magazine, specifically Penthouse.

36:15.740 --> 36:25.360
And then such things happened to it as a student filmmaker at UCLA who doesn't read science fiction ordinarily,

36:25.360 --> 36:28.340
read that story, wrote to me through my agent and said,

36:28.920 --> 36:31.300
you know, I'm blown away by this particular image.

36:31.380 --> 36:33.460
I would like to do a film based on the story.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.500
The man has done that film.

36:35.540 --> 36:38.340
It took him two and a half years to do the film, you know, waiting on tables.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.540
It was a senior project.

36:41.780 --> 36:48.040
I got to see the film in its final cut last September and was incredibly impressed.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.820
It was a very professional job.

36:49.820 --> 36:55.300
Aside from the fact that that filmmaker has, I think, a very bright career ahead of him,

36:55.820 --> 37:00.260
this was the first time that I'd seen my work on the screen in any form.

37:00.840 --> 37:07.960
And there was that magic, virginal moment when for the very first time I saw words that I had written,

37:08.340 --> 37:15.420
dialogue that I had created, characters that I had described up there in living color on a huge screen,

37:16.100 --> 37:18.780
talking and acting and interacting.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.820
And that was a separate magic in itself.

37:22.300 --> 37:29.380
But I think that the reason that the first of my stories to go to film was that one,

37:29.900 --> 37:32.580
just because of the power of the original image.

37:33.100 --> 37:36.660
It struck people and still strikes people and I'm glad for that.

37:37.100 --> 37:37.360
Yeah.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.780
Yeah, that's by far my favorite.

37:39.780 --> 37:46.820
Okay, let me ask this one and then we'll stop on this one, but I got to ask about sharks.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.560
Why sharks? What's your interest in sharks?

37:48.780 --> 37:49.580
Why sharks?

37:51.120 --> 37:54.780
You know, when people visit my apartment, they see all sorts of shark paraphernalia,

37:55.440 --> 38:02.260
you know, jaws mounted on backboards and shark mobiles, shark paintings and so forth and so on.

38:03.180 --> 38:11.140
The reason for the shark motif and the reason that I suppose I've adopted the shark as a sort of totem

38:11.140 --> 38:18.100
is because in the early 70s, one of my closest friends had dreamed the night before,

38:18.440 --> 38:22.860
and she told me about this at breakfast, that she had been in the body of a shark.

38:23.300 --> 38:27.420
She had seen the world through shark colored lenses.

38:29.480 --> 38:34.940
And we talked about this for a while, you know, got past the obvious Freudian symbolism of it all.

38:36.040 --> 38:37.980
And I was fascinated by the dream.

38:39.320 --> 38:45.380
Then she catalyzed action by saying, listen, why don't you write a story about sharks?

38:45.940 --> 38:47.400
Now, I didn't know anything about sharks.

38:47.540 --> 38:50.480
I was just an inland boy who'd grown up far from the sea,

38:50.800 --> 38:54.080
and although the ocean is always fascinated me, I didn't know about sharks.

38:54.080 --> 38:57.380
But I did my research, just as with say particle theory.

38:57.820 --> 38:58.940
I found out about sharks.

38:59.100 --> 39:06.180
I became intrigued by their position in the evolutionary scheme of things, how incredibly well developed they are.

39:06.640 --> 39:14.620
And I was also struck by such images as the fact that the shark is the major species of creature,

39:15.280 --> 39:21.060
which is hostile to human beings, which is in no danger of extinction, at least at this point.

39:21.800 --> 39:31.520
So I took my friend's original dream, and I said, OK, I've got a character who wants to be a shark.

39:31.980 --> 39:33.780
Why does she want to be a shark?

39:34.140 --> 39:38.020
How does she become a shark, both metaphorically and literally?

39:38.620 --> 39:41.600
And that's how the original shark story generated.

39:42.680 --> 39:47.960
I realized after finishing the story that there were other things that involved sharks

39:47.960 --> 39:53.880
that I had not dealt with in the story that I would treat in various other pieces.

39:54.700 --> 40:01.060
What happened then, of course, was the older you get, I think the harder you are to shop for your friends and relatives.

40:01.680 --> 40:02.600
They don't know what to get you.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.160
They know what your tastes are.

40:04.260 --> 40:07.100
They don't know what books you've read or what albums you don't have.

40:09.240 --> 40:13.220
So somehow the shark story caught the fancy of the people around me,

40:13.220 --> 40:15.120
and I started giving me shark paraphernalia.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.140
Before I knew it, I had more sharks than I knew what to do with.

40:18.880 --> 40:23.040
I'm glad it was sharks because Jawsnaught was standing.

40:23.200 --> 40:27.140
There never has been that much in the way of shark artifacts for sale.

40:27.300 --> 40:31.360
If it had been unicorns or dragons, say, I would have been swamped completely and utterly,

40:31.700 --> 40:34.980
and I could have knick-knack and Gigo garage sales.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.480
But instead, I've got some pretty neat shark stuff.

40:38.480 --> 40:44.960
I would say, though, that people ask me, do I really like sharks?

40:45.200 --> 40:50.100
And I have to admit, I don't like sharks. Nobody likes sharks, but I respect sharks.

40:50.920 --> 40:56.880
And sharks as an emblem, as a symbol, truly do fascinate me.

40:57.420 --> 40:59.600
And I expect there will be other shark stories.

41:00.280 --> 41:01.680
There may even be a shark novel.

41:01.680 --> 41:07.240
What militates against a shark novel, of course, quite aside from any of my own feelings about writing a novel,

41:07.620 --> 41:16.400
is I probably have to wait for the furor of Peter Benchley's Jaws to continue dying down.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.520
Okay, let's let him go.
