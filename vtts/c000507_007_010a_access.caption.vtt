00:01.260 --> 00:15.760
we got till 11 he doesn't have to cut out my calls we can also you know if you
want to start over oh there's no yep see all I have to do is hauler big cuss

00:15.760 --> 00:19.920
word you have to okay

00:19.920 --> 00:28.020
george I'll ask you first of all about your background kind of how you grew up
and what might have what was in your background that might lead you to write

00:28.020 --> 00:37.700
science fiction since I know you write other things and we'll talk about that
but we'll concentrate on science fiction I don't know you know specifically

00:37.700 --> 00:51.840
where you look for where you began or anything like this I'd have to go with Tom
Corbett space cadet six years old it was a Saturday morning show at the time you

00:51.840 --> 01:00.560
can now see it on night flight on cable and realize how bad it is but then it
was just fascinating and there were they were showing on television the Flash

01:00.560 --> 01:02.360
Gordon serials when I was a kid

01:05.200 --> 01:26.600
comic books movies and about the fifth grade I realized through the junior high
library that the things I'd been seeing visually were printed matter, also the

01:26.600 --> 01:36.080
closest thing I had found to that beforehand was the Odyssey, which in the
fourth grade I had read about six times, because it had you know all the neat

01:36.080 --> 01:50.540
creatures that Odysseus fought and that's still one of the neatest books ever
written, you know. But I think sort of the early media, early television led

01:50.540 --> 01:57.360
into finding written things in junior high, and which were Heinlein juveniles.

01:59.620 --> 02:08.800
I'm trying to think. I can't even think of the books that were put out then, but
it tended to be Heinlein juvenile type books. And from that to the book club,

02:09.160 --> 02:21.600
science fiction book club, to sitting there no longer eating lunch at school so
I could save my money and hit the small East Texas town that I lived in as

02:21.600 --> 02:34.520
newsstand every Tuesday and Thursday when the new books came in. And from then,
you know, why or when I made the decision to be a writer, I don't know. It was

02:34.520 --> 02:47.660
sort of always there in the back of my mind. first tried to write short stories
in 69 i just graduated from college was working at a television station in

02:47.660 --> 03:00.400
lubbock and was getting terribly bored with it and had not read science fiction
all the time i was in college and had picked up lord light and dune and read

03:00.400 --> 03:11.460
those and went gee there is something to this still and so i wrote about about
three short stories and was immediately rejected and completely forgot about it

03:11.460 --> 03:22.160
until I moved to Dallas and became a member of the Dallas Science Fiction
Society. And there met a couple of people who were trying to write. Steve Utley,

03:23.080 --> 03:38.520
Jake Buddy Saunders, Howard Waldrop. I read what they were writing and had sold
their first stories and got very and said, I can write as bad as this. And in

03:38.520 --> 03:50.280
72, summer of 72, decided I would write a short story a month and made the first
sale in September. And the next short story sale in November and first pen name

03:50.280 --> 04:06.060
novel in January, February of the next year. How long then did you continue
having a real job before you decided to cut loose? I don't like that... writing

04:06.060 --> 04:22.760
is a real job. How long did I have a weekly paycheck coming in? I quit, I was
working for Dallas Morning News. Worked for them five years from 69 to 74, at

04:22.760 --> 04:26.520
which time my

04:26.520 --> 04:42.640
wife was South College, was a teacher. And she's sort of talking, and we had
talked, and her thing was, okay, why don't you try? And I was making enough off

04:42.640 --> 04:57.080
the fiction writing at the time that we thought, well, it would be easy
transition. It wasn't, but it was in 74, August of 74, when I quit the news, and

04:57.080 --> 05:06.680
went full-time freelance writing. It took

05:06.680 --> 05:23.140
me about five years to realize how they both connected. I would not say a
journalistic background was necessary for writing fiction or even would help

05:23.140 --> 05:23.900
most people.

05:26.740 --> 05:39.360
And the greatest value, and some people may feel this is an insult to
journalism, but the greatest value I had was it taught me to do deadlines. It

05:39.360 --> 05:57.560
taught me to write under pressure. It taught me to turn out things very quickly
when needed. it also gave me a nice scope of reference in different parts of

05:57.560 --> 06:09.740
life that most people usually don't get into I was lucky in that I got to fill
in I was a general reporter for about three years and I was more or less the

06:09.740 --> 06:21.880
fill in beat reporter for everybody when they went on vacation so I was suddenly
running all the way from the county courthouse the school board city hall you

06:21.880 --> 06:30.620
get to I got to get in and see a little bit and get a little feel at least but
for the last few years I was with the morning news was county courthouse which

06:30.620 --> 06:46.880
covered anything from the county politics to Sheriff's Office, which is a nice
little basis for sort of seeing the structure of power, because most of my books

06:46.880 --> 06:53.760
tend to be about politics and power in a sort of a general sense.

06:56.400 --> 07:00.380
Okay, the first... They can't see you shaking your head on the radio.

07:04.700 --> 07:14.760
there can't be much two-way communication and then it's really bad on the
telephone because then you can't do it so it's sometimes there's a real long

07:14.760 --> 07:26.100
pregnant pause and then both of you start talking at the same time that's kind
of interesting makes it hard the the answer transfer then was your first

07:26.100 --> 07:32.120
published science fiction novel did when did you write it and how did it Oh, God
help.

07:35.820 --> 07:52.160
This was based on a short story idea that I had when I was in college that I had
written part of and I'd written the short story, shown it to some other writers

07:52.160 --> 08:00.260
and they'd went, oh, this is awful. I'd sent out the short story and apparently
the magazines felt the same way.

08:03.280 --> 08:14.820
the ending I liked, and I said this is a nice ending, so, if it doesn't work as
a short story, maybe I can put a novel around it. And the novel sort of stemmed

08:14.820 --> 08:15.120
from

08:18.280 --> 08:32.780
about three years there of death penalty trials and very long sentence trials.
It was the criminal

08:32.780 --> 08:43.340
justice in thing at the time in Dallas to give these multiple thousand-year
prison

08:43.340 --> 08:44.400
terms.

08:48.520 --> 08:57.420
And the whole thing sort of seemed ludicrous to me. And I'm very much against
the death penalty. It just seems like a waste. There ought to be a way to do

08:57.420 --> 09:13.080
something about it instead of wasting human life. And the whole thing sort of
started as thinking, well, why not use a prison colony planet the way we settle

09:13.080 --> 09:23.280
parts of this country? And that never really got into the Esper transfer. It got
into Shadow Man later. But that's where the book sort of stemmed from was going

09:23.280 --> 09:34.700
to those trials. And also at that book point I realized when I was through, this
is a Western and not a science fiction book. And I think it was that book that I

09:34.700 --> 09:45.080
decided if I had a western idea it would be written as a Western and not as
science fiction. And the only time I would use science fiction as a tool is when

09:45.080 --> 09:56.860
it was there as a tool you couldn't tell the story any other way. which led to
the most recent book which is Enemies and is a western and it could have been

09:56.860 --> 10:06.600
done as science fiction but I think it's stronger doing it the way it was
supposed to be done So you're saying that as I'm learning in this process a lot

10:06.600 --> 10:17.400
of writers write in various genres not just science fiction but they'll write
westerns so you're saying they're not really that far apart there are elements

10:17.400 --> 10:25.660
common to both And sometimes you could swing either way. Oh, definitely. I think
the mistake is you get a lot of bad science fiction by people who should have

10:25.660 --> 10:37.300
written it as a war story, a mystery, a romance, or whatever. They're so hung up
on science fiction as the only way to tell a story, and it's not. It's the only

10:37.300 --> 10:47.560
way to tell certain stories. And that's what I'd like to do is limit those
certain stories for me to science fiction and not try to bring in stories that

10:47.560 --> 11:01.240
would be better told in another field. If it's a mystery, write as a mystery. If
it's, like I say, a Western, write as a Western. It would probably be a stronger

11:01.240 --> 11:12.320
story than trying to make up a whole society, whole world to handle it when it
already exists. And then he can play with the characterization instead of having

11:12.320 --> 11:25.020
to make the background. I'm glad you brought that up one thing I gotta ask you
cuz I couldn't find it in the new dictionary what's a punch hits I know who

11:25.020 --> 11:48.320
that's who so that was deliberate it was deliberate it was a little bit of
Tucker is on using a friend's name for something and that's what I did okay

11:48.320 --> 11:53.960
I'll

11:53.960 --> 12:03.920
ask you to comment in major books published he Esper transfer what what did you
think of the cover and the promotion and that sort of thing this was your first

12:03.920 --> 12:10.720
novel I'm sure probably you

12:10.720 --> 12:22.120
know in retrospect it wasn't all that great of a novel I'm not saying it's bad
but the more you write hopefully the better you do and by the time that book

12:22.120 --> 12:26.060
came out I had a other projects so

12:29.600 --> 12:41.540
oh it's one of these strange things with me the project's done it's sold I'm on
20 other things and the high for me is selling it having it accepted and I

12:41.540 --> 12:51.180
probably should pay more attention to promotion and so forth but it's hard to
get excited about something that you wrote 18 months ago and you've had three

12:51.180 --> 13:01.220
other projects completed in that time and you're working on another one, and
that has your interest. I heard Curt Douglas say this, and this is the only

13:01.220 --> 13:10.600
person I've ever heard say that, that once you finish something and you're on to
something else, it's hard to get back to where you were on that and really enjoy

13:10.600 --> 13:18.120
if there's any achievement there, because you're working on something new. I was
really surprised to hear somebody else say that, because I'd never heard it

13:18.120 --> 13:31.020
before. But that's the way I am on it. It's major books. Was a little known book
company and the distribution on it was apparently atrocious.

13:35.560 --> 13:48.640
Nobody read it. Nobody saw it. The cover was OK. It sort of surprised me that at
least the creature they rode was what I had described. There were no winged

13:48.640 --> 13:50.260
demons in it, but it was on the cover.

13:54.000 --> 14:05.080
the surprising thing is the last copy I saw of that sucker sell it I think it
was a $1.75 book $1.25 I can't remember it was going for $5 and I was like wait

14:05.080 --> 14:21.040
a minute but it probably got what most first novels got which was a little or
nothing okay um okay Shadow Man was in the next science fiction book that you

14:21.040 --> 14:34.980
know and it's also the first one I read before I met you in Lubbock I read it so
I known G-O-W Proctor had written. The thing that I find interesting in your

14:34.980 --> 14:45.760
science fiction you don't hit us in the face with the science fiction it's kind
of it's self-explanatory when the guy goes in and I wrote down the accelerated

14:45.760 --> 14:53.640
growth module and the talking caps they're just they're just it's mentioned
offhand and you don't go into to the professor so-and-so does go into two pages

14:53.640 --> 15:02.560
of lecturing on what it is it's just self-explanatory I think that's a talent
that not every writer has they there's there's not explanations in your books I

15:02.560 --> 15:12.640
think they are much more interesting for that reason good so do I you know
that's what I'm trying for Okay. So this is something you consciously try to do.

15:12.780 --> 15:26.820
You don't use that lecture mode. We have to hear how the hell the drive works.
Yeah, definitely. First of all, it's bad writing, and I think more than that,

15:26.820 --> 15:38.340
it's bad reading. I notice it in other people's writing when they do it and you
go, oh my God, I'm fixing to have to listen to a chapter of why this planet is

15:38.340 --> 15:51.080
revolving the wrong way or why this drive works. And it gets down to it, I drive
a car. I have no idea how that car works. I mean, I've got a general idea, but

15:51.080 --> 15:58.880
it's not something every time I get in the car and I turn it on and put my foot
to the accelerator, I think, well the gas is going here and the spark plug is

15:58.880 --> 16:10.300
doing this, and so forth. And I think your future characters that you set up are
not going to do that. They're going to hop on the bus, and if that bus is

16:10.300 --> 16:22.840
automated in some way they're not going to even notice it. And so you have to
slip that in on the reader too. I believe in introducing new phrases and then

16:22.840 --> 16:37.320
immediately explaining that phrase by showing its function or trying to come up
with the words to describe it in its title. I think that is good. It does not

16:37.320 --> 16:50.600
slow the reader down at all. And I have had non-science fiction readers going
through my stuff and saying they were able to read it because of that. One

16:50.600 --> 17:04.680
phrase the yearly psycho profile exam to eliminate any social tendencies that
might not be a bad idea and I said I think it's anti social tendencies wasn't it

17:04.680 --> 17:08.360
yeah I

17:08.360 --> 17:14.540
was taken by that afraid let's

17:14.540 --> 17:23.300
see I also have here in the margin of the Tommy John and the Carrie Ann as far
as it were these are Are these little inside jokes or is that just – I'm a fan

17:23.300 --> 17:34.500
of Tommy John. He's a hell of a pitcher. What's really funny is that probably
one of the biggest Yankee fans I know read the book and never noticed it. They

17:34.500 --> 17:45.280
used to call him the man with the bionic arm before the bionic thing was in.
I've just always been a Tommy John fan, so I named a spaceship after him. Carrie

17:45.280 --> 17:56.620
Ann was a song I had to like at one time. I think everybody slips things like
that in. I won't say they're in jokes or anything, but they make it a little

17:56.620 --> 18:05.480
more enjoyable for the reader to catch something like that occasionally. I have
never seen any writer of any field that doesn't do stuff like that. You can't

18:05.480 --> 18:16.020
help but do it. Sneak up in here. Okay. For what it's worth, Shadow Man is a
direct...

18:19.620 --> 18:29.820
spin-off of what I was talking about, The Courthouse. That is your death penalty
book. This is an answer to the death penalty. And the whole idea is getting back

18:29.820 --> 18:40.020
to, I think, what Gordy Dickson once said of setting up a utopia and then finding
what's wrong with it, and that's your story. And this is where we had the planet

18:41.460 --> 18:54.880
colonized by hardened criminals who had had one thing I called brain wipes and
new personality implants. And they were totally happy world until they realized

18:54.880 --> 19:05.900
what they had formerly been, or at least until one character had. And that did
stem from all the death penalties of what do you do with hardened criminals?

19:06.180 --> 19:18.160
Well, find something. You're wasting a lot of flesh that could be used for
something else. and got to the thing of good and evil at the end, which was a, I

19:18.160 --> 19:27.000
don't know if it was that major, as to trying to come up with something you can
do with hardened criminals and use them in some useful purpose. Whether or not

19:27.000 --> 19:37.020
we'll ever have that capability or not is yet to be seen, but I thought it was
interesting to play with. So Shadow Man and the S for Transfer had the same

19:37.020 --> 19:42.500
route. Yeah. this idea of the psychic or whatever? Definitely. Okay,

19:47.520 --> 19:58.720
I liked Fire at the Center. And I was going to ask, first of all, was that your
title, and second of all, what does it refer? Because I missed it. fire at the

19:58.720 --> 20:08.660
center is my title. surprise me that they kept it. the reason that they came it
is apparently fire is one of those buzz words that sell books. lust in the dust.

20:08.820 --> 20:23.160
lust sells books. so do fire. so does cat. cat in the title sells books. pyramid
means fire at the center. and the book is about pyramids. let's the normal

20:23.160 --> 20:30.560
question fire at the center of what? but that's what pyramid means is fire at
the center. And I do mention it in the book.

20:34.860 --> 20:47.900
I usually read very carefully. I'm still glad I asked it. I liked the thing. I
liked page one. I checked it in. It's page one. You say, there's no time paradox

20:47.900 --> 20:56.200
because you can alter the past. And then you don't have to worry about that
crap. I get tired of Silverberg. does it humorously or something. I get tired of

20:56.200 --> 21:05.500
all of this, again, this endless lecturing on why there wouldn't be a time
paradox. You just said let's get rid of it, and you did. That's what being God

21:05.500 --> 21:19.100
does. Basically a writer is you set up the ... In science fiction, you set up, I
guess, the rules to this game. Now, the next book I write may have a paradox in

21:19.100 --> 21:27.000
it, if I used time travel again, but you set up the rules to this game and if
the reader can accept those rules, then the book, they can suspend their belief

21:27.000 --> 21:40.200
and read the book and enjoy it. I find Shadow Man a much better book. I think it
has a little more depth to it. It's got a lot better characters in it and the

21:40.200 --> 21:48.140
readers like Fire at the Center better, which shows that a writer usually
doesn't know what the readers will consider the better book.

21:52.560 --> 22:03.800
Okay. Next question is the one I alluded to earlier. You must have been
infatuated with dinosaurs, or maybe you still are because the trinosaur's wreck

22:03.800 --> 22:14.340
scenes were realistic and they seemed to be lovingly done and carefully done.
They were. They were done for my wife. The original scene, first 40 pages of

22:14.340 --> 22:20.540
that book, is a novelette I had written strictly for my wife, who is a dinosaur
collector.

22:24.360 --> 22:31.400
They were written only for her, though I tried to sell the stories again, where
I wrote a story and the short story wouldn't sell. Or the novelette, in this

22:31.400 --> 22:32.120
case, wouldn't sell.

22:34.920 --> 22:45.740
So I put another story with it and just used that as an opening action adventure
scene to meet the character, get the reader interested in the book. But that was

22:45.740 --> 22:56.660
written for my wife and my wife only. And that a lot of people else, a lot of
other people have enjoyed it. It means there's a lot of dinosaur fans around.

22:59.260 --> 23:13.080
And everybody seemed to like the Regina rather than the Rex at the end. It hit
me whenever when I was reading it hit me it entered my mind that maybe that is a

23:13.080 --> 23:26.680
female especially They almost got together things kind of change but oh I like
to the detail the attention that you paid just to the crashing sounds and The

23:26.680 --> 23:37.580
description of how it was wondering Pretty damn fast It's a chicken running.
Yeah, with a long tail out behind It's probably one of the most ungraceful

23:37.580 --> 23:53.000
things you can imagine I think there's this love affair with most people in
science in science or most people in general with these gigantic creatures that

23:53.000 --> 24:00.000
disappeared from the earth and it's just too tempting not to go back and play
with them somewhere and suddenly they were here and they're gone Well, they

24:00.000 --> 24:02.140
learned to hide in the trees They're still here

24:04.980 --> 24:15.600
Yeah Yeah, I got interested in when I was seven, and it had a lot of change. My
daughter is six, and she's very interested in it and I never brought them up or

24:15.600 --> 24:25.360
pushed them. Of course, five is a small device where I was collecting myself and
I've literally looked at it every once in a while. We have a plesiosaurus fin

24:25.360 --> 24:37.860
bone now, from one of their flippers. We have occasionally we go out and dig
rocks and get fossils and so forth. And somebody brought us a plesiosaurus bone.

24:37.980 --> 24:50.060
Actually brought it for my wife, one of their little fin bones, which is bigger
than your foot, bigger than my foot, which is awful large. And people bring her

24:50.060 --> 25:03.360
dinosaurs everywhere. students that go over to Russia on summer trips and so
forth will it's where they'll bring her back these little ceramic dinosaurs they

25:03.360 --> 25:14.660
picked up at a museum somewhere or I'm wearing shirt that says have you hugged
your dinosaur today which came from the Albuquerque natural history museum that

25:14.660 --> 25:21.940
person brought us back I think we gave up counting when she had some 700
something dinosaurs.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.440
It shows.

25:29.760 --> 25:43.900
The future that you portrayed for humans in this book was pretty grim. You had
the Kavanites and the Lofgrenists of rigid authority versus maybe some kind of

25:43.900 --> 25:52.120
adversity. First of all, is there any significance in the names of the Kavanites
and the Lofgrenists? No. Though I found out the main character there's Nils

25:52.120 --> 26:04.400
Kendler and this is something I didn't know and I named the group the Lofgren
and I got a couple letters saying well you named that after Nils Lofgren, the

26:04.400 --> 26:11.020
guitarist I never heard of him I was going to ask if you heard he's Nils he
works with New Young he does now well I found

26:13.760 --> 26:27.360
actually what I found out I think he was a guitarist for What's his name? The
Heart-Shaped Glasses Plays the Piano. I think it was with Elton John for a

26:27.360 --> 26:39.120
while. And I'd never heard of him as a guitarist. And it really surprised me.
It's one of those things, a character in that book, I can't think of the name

26:39.120 --> 26:43.860
now, but it came back that one of the copy editors were reading and I had
called,

26:46.480 --> 26:58.940
and i hit the name of one of the writers of hair and i had to change that name
did not realize that either but there was no nils lofgren in there it was it's

26:58.940 --> 27:08.380
something that i'd never heard of the man just your points i know larry nivens
uh oh the one that murdered mystery on the moon he's got a character naomi

27:08.380 --> 27:19.660
mitchison and there's a science fiction writer named You remember what, Naomi
Mitchell said. The subconscious does funny things. There's a

27:19.660 --> 27:31.020
little throwaway line you had in this book that I also wrote down. 50% of the
population says... That is not a throwaway line. But I liked that. That was not

27:31.020 --> 27:40.880
a throwaway line. That has to do with how I feel every day morning when I shave.
This is a dumb way to start the morning with a razor at your throat. And that's

27:40.880 --> 27:56.020
the best line in the book. I wrote it down. And that was one that impressed me.
The other one that I used was that the only universal religious symbol is the

27:56.020 --> 28:07.480
collection tray. That's in there. Those were both very purposely put in. But my
favorite line in the book is about the razor. I chuckled when I came up with

28:07.480 --> 28:22.180
that one. Okay an obvious question then, you must be
somewhat interested in pyramids and so called pyramid power. They seem to be a

28:22.180 --> 28:33.820
universal symbol, kind of attractive, not like dinosaurs. No I'm not. Could you
just do your research? What it was is way back when, before it became the craze,

28:34.020 --> 28:45.240
some kid came up to my wife and was putting it out, showing her these books and
showing her some stuff. And I started looking then and realized, gee, this is a

28:45.240 --> 28:57.400
nice little thing for Quack's to play with. And that's sort of the basis of the
book. And the pyramidology, or whatever they're calling it now, came around

28:57.960 --> 29:10.860
before the book ever got published. Most of that stuff was done prior to all the
pyramid interests coming out. which surprised me that I guess it's ripe for

29:10.860 --> 29:22.160
people that are looking for secret answers instead of using their heads. But
that sort of thing makes very interesting science fiction. It's fun to play

29:22.160 --> 29:32.060
with. Flying saucers are fun to play with. I don't believe in them. I believe in
alien intelligence. I don't believe intelligent beings would be doing all the so

29:32.060 --> 29:41.860
forth things that you see. the other so forth so-called UFO type folks saying
they're doing that's fun to play with.

29:45.460 --> 29:55.160
ok at the end of the book everybody takes off in The Seeker it looks to me like
if you wanted to you could continue do you have any plans to do this? the book

29:55.160 --> 30:08.060
has been written the book has been sold it's called Star Wings Fawcett bought it
Fawcett was then sold to Ballantyne Books oh the book is back in my hands now

30:08.060 --> 30:20.420
and we're trying to sell it again we got the money for it but Ballantyne didn't
want to publish it so whether or not the book is ever published it is really

30:20.420 --> 30:26.040
wild speculation I'd like to see it since I published since I wrote it.

30:28.880 --> 30:42.660
For those who care, it begins 200 years after the ending of the first book and
has nothing to do or does not involve the characters in the first book. It does

30:42.660 --> 30:44.640
involve another Mind Merger

30:47.860 --> 31:04.640
who is mostly mechanical. He has been blown away during a New Loughranes
Kavanite war. And the woman he loves, who is also a psychotic, and it is

31:04.640 --> 31:07.080
psychotic despite what the editors changed it to,

31:10.660 --> 31:23.240
has been killed, and they have cloned her again. And it is an 18-year-old
version of the woman he loves, and he's having to work with her. When she was

31:23.240 --> 31:36.820
nice and young. And he falls in love with the new woman differently, but it
involves time travel again but in a totally different way. And we do find out

31:36.820 --> 31:47.980
about the Urina and the Seeker and everything, but it does begin 200 years. Is
this going to be your known process when you keep writing science fiction? Are

31:47.980 --> 31:53.560
you going to stay in this known universe for a while, is it? No. No, it was just
that...

31:56.020 --> 32:10.880
In fact, the original design of the book was not to be a sequel. The book stands
on its own. And it just happened to be I had this set of circumstances and this

32:10.880 --> 32:14.740
other book idea, and they tied together, so why not use it?

32:18.060 --> 32:26.040
And then Editor Fawcett said, okay. In fact, she even said you don't have to do
it this way. The book stands by itself. I said, well, we've got this and we've

32:26.040 --> 32:36.000
got that, so why not use them? So we went ahead and did it as a sequel, which
may be the problem in trying to resell the book because most publishers don't

32:36.000 --> 32:45.160
like to pick up sequels that were done by another company. So it might be the
situation when we get Fyre at the Center back that we can sell them as a package

32:45.160 --> 32:58.840
deal to somebody. Okay. okay tell me then about Lone Star Universe and how that
got started and how the idea of regional anthology etc sheer insanity

33:02.180 --> 33:12.420
one day a bunch of us who just made their first sales were sitting around
laughingly saying yeah one day there's going to be enough writers in Texas that

33:12.420 --> 33:21.600
we can put out our own anthology and to hell with all these people that don't
buy our stories and as it was I think that was Howard Waldrop was there, Steven

33:21.600 --> 33:26.580
Utley Buddy Saunders and we're just sitting around joking putting a fanzine
together

33:29.480 --> 33:41.400
and I guess I was the only person that really sort of took it seriously and as
it was Steve and I put a proposal together and sent it first to a man out in

33:41.400 --> 33:54.320
Midland, Odessa whose name escapes me now but he was doing Texana-type books,
and he came back and liked the idea but wasn't going to pick it up and suggested

33:54.320 --> 34:07.940
we send it to Heidelberg Press in Austin, and we did, and they picked it up. And
by that time, there were enough known writers in Texas and award winners that it

34:07.940 --> 34:10.800
really did seem feasible and seem like a good idea.

34:14.420 --> 34:27.660
and got put together. Sort of interesting. It makes for a lot of jokes, you
know, regional science fiction. But our thought was, you know, Texan is in, and

34:27.660 --> 34:38.640
here's this whole realm that's never been really looked at. And what's funny is
it sparked a lot of other regional science fiction books. It was the first. And

34:38.640 --> 34:49.660
everybody chuckled and laughed, And then there was about five that came out on
its heels because it had never been thought of. And what was funny is that I

34:49.660 --> 35:02.160
meet new editors in New York. They know my name, Be Alone Star Universe, rather
than some of the novels I've done, which is surprising. But again, New York is

35:02.160 --> 35:12.140
surprised by new ideas, and that's, I think, the reason it was noticed. I lived
in New York when it came out. I tried to get a copy and they made it in the

35:12.140 --> 35:26.460
Science Fiction shop and they had never heard of it. I'd seen it in Texas. Yeah.
I'd seen it in books, and that ... Okay that is a problem. I got a copy of it

35:26.460 --> 35:36.860
from Purple Unicorn last summer when I showed it to you, and I looked it very
surprised. Then, I just saw Scott with about seven on his desk. Can you ...

35:36.860 --> 35:48.620
What's the background on the scarcity? and hoarding and the warehouse, quote,
unquote, that's got books on it. Can you say that without getting us sued for

35:48.620 --> 36:01.380
libel about what's going on? Well, Heidelberg stopped publishing, as best I can
tell, just about the time they brought out the book. There were big plans to do

36:01.380 --> 36:12.580
posters and everything to go with the book, you know, full posters of the cover,
which the cover is gorgeous. it's one of those double take covers and as it was

36:12.580 --> 36:21.500
they sort of went out of business about that time and far as I know only a few
thousand were distributed and they're still sitting in a warehouse somewhere

36:22.660 --> 36:36.240
making scarce items it's surprising that you go to conventions large conventions
in and out of state and there will always be several people ask me how you get a

36:36.240 --> 36:46.160
copy of the book It's rare because it was not distributed. There's apparently
tons of the books still around. You just can't get a hold of them. It's a nice

36:46.160 --> 36:47.360
item to have for a collector.

36:50.500 --> 37:00.700
I told David to collect hardbacks. I said you better buy a guy. They can get you
to sign it and all, but it's one to have. Is there any chance that you'll ever

37:00.700 --> 37:07.360
get the rights back and get a paperback edition out or something like that in a
broader distribution? I don't think so because I think it is, you know, it's a

37:07.360 --> 37:19.060
limited item to Texana. I really think it has more value as Texana than it does
to the science fiction field as a whole. Those science fiction collectors want

37:19.060 --> 37:20.200
it because it is a first.

37:24.440 --> 37:34.780
The stories are good. I think there's a wide variety of stories. science fiction
reviews that I saw of it, their complaint was that there was a wide variety of

37:35.340 --> 37:46.940
stories in there, that it wasn't all nuts and bolts, and it wasn't all New Wave,
but there was everything, and that's whole idea of the book was to show the

37:46.940 --> 37:57.560
diversity of the science fiction writers in this state. I think it did that
well, and I think it produced good stories by everybody that was in there. would

37:57.560 --> 38:03.000
you ever have any illusions of perhaps volume two of course

38:08.560 --> 38:27.680
there may or may not be it depends on I know one person now who is editor for a
Texas publisher and he has has mentioned in passing that he'd like to get a hold

38:27.680 --> 38:39.780
of the first book since it never was really distributed is maybe buy them all
out if possible whether or not that'll ever happen is something else but yeah,

38:40.000 --> 38:49.480
why not, it was fun the people who got it seemed to enjoy it and I still think
if it would get some more sort of distribution it would be a money making book

38:49.480 --> 38:50.560
in Texas

38:53.560 --> 39:15.540
just the the the charisma of the state and the chauvinistic attitude of Texans
which is equivalent to New York we're just larger we buy Texan whether we read

39:15.540 --> 39:26.720
it or not we buy it and I think there's a market for it How did you get, and
maybe I should parent that, why Harlan Ellison to do the foreword? It was

39:26.720 --> 39:39.580
actually windbagging foreword. It was actually good. Well, Harlan writes an
eye's foreword. We knew Harlan and we made no qualms about it. Harlan was better

39:39.580 --> 39:54.500
known than we were. Harlan sells books. Harlan realized he sold books. And he
was willing to do it for us. he's also known to audience outside science fiction

39:57.200 --> 40:10.040
in many cases people read his works and they do not read any other science
fiction so you know it was a selling point also Harlan had a lot of connection

40:10.700 --> 40:14.760
with people here he had a lot of friends here and he wanted to do it

40:18.220 --> 40:29.640
whether or not we would do that something like that on a second volume if there
is ever a second volume I don't know but why not

40:32.720 --> 40:45.500
and I think it is a drawing point gets people to look at the book if they've
ever had a chance to look at the book why is all of a sudden why is there a

40:45.500 --> 40:55.980
large group of writers in Texas? This isn't historical. They've mostly been on
the coast. Is it just now getting to be a nice place to live, opening up? No,

40:56.060 --> 41:05.460
it's been here for 10 years, I mean, as far as science fiction writers go.
They've always been around. They've never been noted as Texan before. I think

41:05.460 --> 41:20.680
early 70s to mid-70s, we had a lot of fans who turned professional, started
selling their stories. They were friends from all over the state. They suddenly

41:20.680 --> 41:25.740
became a very large group that were selling and were noticeable.

41:28.800 --> 41:41.040
That this group was here, had made it, gave a lot of other folks who wanted to
write incentive to do it. and you've got suddenly a whole second wave of Texas

41:41.040 --> 41:50.460
writers coming out, meeting them here for the first time that have just begun to
sell their first stories or their first novel, but you've suddenly got a second

41:50.460 --> 42:00.220
wave of Texas science fiction writers, which is kind of nice. Maybe we ought to
flip it. I have one more question I want to ask you. There's a little bit. Okay.

42:00.380 --> 42:12.220
I want to ask you, okay, you've also edited the Science Fiction Hall of Fame
with Arthur C. Clark. How does it feel to be on the other side of the podium and

42:12.220 --> 42:21.340
be an editor in Pick and Choose? I think most writers think they're better
editors than they are writers. In that case, with Science Fiction Hall of Fame,

42:21.440 --> 42:31.760
it wasn't a Pick and Choose thing. It was merely the paperwork of taking award
-winning stories. They were already chosen. It was just getting the contracts

42:31.760 --> 42:49.140
together and what should have been a three week short work turned out to be six
months of hard labor of tracking people down. And in one case, there was one of

42:49.140 --> 43:00.340
the writers had died and I had to work through this date and it took four
contracts before I ever got one returned. It was the same contract, and they

43:00.340 --> 43:08.180
swore they were sending them back, but I never got them. So I said, well, it
should have been a couple weeks' work turned into six months of ulcers trying to

43:08.180 --> 43:17.820
get the thing together. Would you recommend that all writers maybe go through
that once just to see what it's like? Oh, definitely. See all the garbage you

43:17.820 --> 43:25.360
get to read. I think you probably have more of a normal

43:25.360 --> 43:39.760
editing situation with uh Lone Star Universe um I started out getting those
stories I had a lot of stories submitted that we didn't take I was going to do

43:39.760 --> 43:52.020
something that I thought editors should do is tell them why you didn't like the
story or here's what turned me off and one of the first stories the first line I

43:52.020 --> 44:03.120
had written of his story was ambiguous and I showed him why and I got back the
nastiest letter and from that point I wrote the little sorry this does not fit

44:03.120 --> 44:14.740
our needs this isn't worth my time and effort so you suddenly realize you get
these terrible rejection slips that have been printed out because I think a lot

44:14.740 --> 44:16.320
of people probably react that way

44:19.900 --> 44:28.500
What are you going to do? Are you going to keep writing science fiction westerns
ghost writing just you enjoy what you're doing you think you're going to keep it

44:28.500 --> 44:41.060
up for a while one of the nice things about writing is it allows you the time to
do other things that you want you know i've painted i paint a little bit and

44:41.060 --> 44:53.360
recently turning to word processing i've never played with a computer in my life
i grew up believing you had to be a genius and spend your whole life time

44:53.360 --> 45:06.960
learning to use one. I was drug kicking and screaming into a computer store and
fell in love and have written my first game for computer. And I'm working on a

45:06.960 --> 45:17.660
second one. I'm using them to teach myself to program. And I'm finding myself
being drawn to that a bit. Writing allows me the time to play with that. So

45:17.660 --> 45:28.800
yeah. And I'll continue writing. And I'll have the shot at going out on any sort
of tangents that I want to and playing with that. I think I'll probably for the

45:28.800 --> 45:39.500
time being head for a lot of non-science fiction projects. Things that I've been
wanting to write. I want to do a book called Panels. Which is about a science

45:39.500 --> 45:40.260
fiction fan.

45:43.720 --> 45:53.760
And talking about the 60s. and telling from sort of a different angle. I think
everybody that lived through World War II wants to write a World War II book,

45:53.760 --> 46:01.020
and anybody that lived through the 60s wants to write a 60s book, and I want to
do it a bit differently, and it's going to be told from a point of a science

46:01.020 --> 46:03.240
fiction fan and blame it all on the Lone Ranger.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.780
Man has a rare book over there. Thank you.

46:16.620 --> 46:22.740
It didn't mention art once. No, I was going to talk to you. We'll get that
later.
