00:01.320 --> 00:05.000
Another character that appeared in these stories was Christian Prager.

00:05.520 --> 00:06.960
He appeared in three of them.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.660
Do you plan to use him in anything else in the future?

00:10.480 --> 00:14.640
Well, I once thought of taking those three or the four stories.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.720
I don't remember how many.

00:16.780 --> 00:19.640
And using the basis of a novel.

00:20.320 --> 00:27.560
But I began to feel that the Prager stories perhaps belong to the ecological 60s.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.060
And that perhaps it was dated.

00:31.820 --> 00:34.440
Although from what I've been hearing in recent years,

00:34.640 --> 00:36.780
I've perhaps been in the ecological problem,

00:36.900 --> 00:38.200
especially that they're not dated.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.360
I like the character.

00:43.880 --> 00:47.360
He was the character in my first story, the water sculptor.

00:48.060 --> 00:52.380
And then he was a much younger version of himself in the sassans of air.

00:53.100 --> 00:56.540
And then in Parks and Rest and Culture, he was a little older.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.940
There's an interesting background there.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.240
But it's essentially the background of something like The Sheep Look Up by John Brunner.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.440
Many writers were writing that kind of ecological story in the 60s.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.020
I don't know.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.760
You're sufficiently interested that you would like to see a book incorporating those stories.

01:18.540 --> 01:19.820
Sure, he was quite interesting.

01:19.820 --> 01:20.620
He was.

01:21.060 --> 01:23.760
Well, that's something that's never been said to me about him.

01:26.180 --> 01:29.160
Speaking of that ecological 60s,

01:29.980 --> 01:34.700
the stories that you just mentioned are quite bleak ecologically.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.940
Does this mirror your personal fears?

01:38.500 --> 01:43.100
Well, I tend to believe that things could be very good.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.060
Human beings could do quite well with their science and technology.

01:47.060 --> 01:51.300
And even though I'm a great believer in science and technology,

01:51.860 --> 01:55.640
I still feel that we could very easily destroy ourselves.

01:56.340 --> 02:01.340
It's not absolutely a foregone conclusion that we're going to do very well.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.280
So I'm not bleak.

02:05.920 --> 02:06.800
I'm just critical.

02:09.700 --> 02:14.100
The water sculptor, which featured Christian Frager,

02:14.100 --> 02:18.100
seemed to have some elements in it that anticipated macro life.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.260
Was that conscious or unconscious?

02:21.660 --> 02:30.120
The theme that I possibly inherited from Arthur Seekmark is that space travel will be the opening of space,

02:30.320 --> 02:34.960
both for exploration and science as well as for industry,

02:35.280 --> 02:39.780
will lead to a renaissance of world culture.

02:39.780 --> 02:49.800
Now this happened quite clearly in the renaissance when Columbus and all the other great explorers opened up the new world.

02:50.640 --> 02:51.840
That was the age of Shakespeare.

02:52.300 --> 02:56.460
That was the age of many of the scientists.

02:57.320 --> 03:02.080
It was a new opening of human possibility.

03:02.080 --> 03:10.180
And I think that space travel will help create a different environment for the Earth.

03:10.840 --> 03:17.880
I think much of the industry that will be space-based will help redeem the planet from what we've done to it.

03:18.520 --> 03:24.880
And I think that new environment, that new world that will open up,

03:24.880 --> 03:34.080
will deposit a different interior.

03:34.560 --> 03:39.760
It will deposit a new world in the human heart, is what I'm trying to say.

03:40.820 --> 03:44.260
This is something that is not understood by many people,

03:44.500 --> 03:52.140
but any great environmental change deposits a new world in the human mind and in the human heart.

03:53.020 --> 04:00.460
The possibility is certainly there that the future opening of space and the further growth of science and technology

04:00.460 --> 04:03.660
might lead to a more humane society.

04:03.980 --> 04:07.420
It's certainly a possibility, although it's not a foregone conclusion.

04:10.540 --> 04:15.620
Okay, now we get to macro life, which has got to be your crowning achievement so far.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.620
Is it...

04:19.620 --> 04:27.140
Okay, you have ambitions to write the serious literary science fiction, which kind of escapes the old moles.

04:27.580 --> 04:31.900
Are you satisfied that that's what it is? Did you accomplish that?

04:32.560 --> 04:35.460
Well, I'll make the case for you to decide.

04:36.500 --> 04:44.140
On the one hand, macro life is an attempt not to simply produce the illusion of thought

04:44.140 --> 04:49.860
that you get in a piece of science fiction, but to actually bring in the thought,

04:51.180 --> 04:56.700
not as a piece of bakery, very often thinking and reasoning,

04:57.260 --> 05:01.820
which is very much a part of the human mind as much as feeling and action,

05:02.780 --> 05:09.400
is simply brought in as a sublimated kind of material or gloss on the story.

05:09.400 --> 05:18.520
I wanted to bring in the actual thought, the reasoning, the philosophizing into a piece of science fiction.

05:18.700 --> 05:27.580
Now, this is a nod with the traditional novel, which moves by action, by feeling, by character, by metaphor, by image,

05:27.680 --> 05:30.940
although there's a good deal of that in macro life also.

05:30.940 --> 05:40.860
But it's sufficient new material or material that some people would find alien to fiction in the book

05:40.860 --> 05:43.540
to make it seem strange to many readers.

05:43.800 --> 05:55.320
I have nothing against writing the traditional novel, the slick kind of novel that many people like to read,

05:55.520 --> 05:56.800
you know, the so-called good read.

05:56.800 --> 06:01.960
I have nothing really against that, but I think in macro life I had to do it this way.

06:03.740 --> 06:09.760
Perhaps in other books against the same background, I'll write the more accessible kind of novel,

06:10.520 --> 06:17.960
even though I hope I'll be able to work in more of the thought and the philosophy in different ways.

06:19.320 --> 06:24.980
You approach macro life in the way I just described, then you probably will have no trouble reading it,

06:24.980 --> 06:33.780
but if you expect the traditional novel, the good read, you may find that you have to work at it a little bit.

06:34.680 --> 06:41.800
The trouble is that science fiction is a field where it professes to be a literature of ideas and a literature of thinking,

06:42.420 --> 06:52.380
but yet when a writer brings in the thinking and the ideas table back off, they don't really want the actual experience of thinking or reasoning.

06:52.380 --> 07:02.200
But I believe that these things belong to human character as much as feeling and acting, so why shouldn't it be there?

07:02.880 --> 07:07.620
I was quite surprised at how deep the prejudice runs against this kind of thing.

07:08.620 --> 07:14.660
Some people are able to pick up macro life and read through it with fascination,

07:15.040 --> 07:18.900
which surprises me given the kind of climate I'm describing,

07:18.900 --> 07:24.660
and other people just can't seem to get beyond three or four pages.

07:24.840 --> 07:31.560
One editor who was supposed to read it for a possible paper library print confessed that he couldn't get beyond three or four pages,

07:32.100 --> 07:36.380
and this guy has a PhD in literature.

07:36.880 --> 07:44.880
I was quite horrified to see this, but I'm afraid that many such people are educated well beyond their intelligence.

07:48.440 --> 07:53.000
You can't hear my laughing because I have the button off, but that's good.

07:54.180 --> 07:58.960
Let's talk a little bit about the background, the concept of macro life.

07:59.140 --> 08:03.380
When did you get the idea and how long did you mull it over before you put it to paper?

08:03.760 --> 08:09.420
Well, afterwards, the art cover gives the history of how I came upon it.

08:09.420 --> 08:13.660
I think I read an article by G. Harry Stein, who was a real hard-fiance kind of buffed,

08:13.660 --> 08:18.240
and he complained that all the really new ideas, this was around 1961,

08:19.300 --> 08:24.420
he complained that all the new ideas were being ignored by science fiction

08:24.420 --> 08:31.900
and that the best speculations were going on, places like General Electric and think tanks and whatever,

08:32.140 --> 08:35.060
and the science fiction writers were 25 years behind at times.

08:36.840 --> 08:42.220
I looked at one of the ideas he mentioned, which was a concept called macro life,

08:42.340 --> 08:49.460
two words by Dan Rich Cole, and this was for something called the ultimate human society.

08:50.940 --> 08:57.420
Cole made a lot of sense to me, and so I decided then that I was going to write a novel to be called Mancroll Life.

08:57.420 --> 09:07.200
But over the years, I called I think in 1965, but over the years I developed the idea much further than he had taken it.

09:07.840 --> 09:18.780
His macro worlds were on the order of the Queen Mary, 10,000 tons, 10,000 ton world, but very small,

09:19.620 --> 09:24.060
probably closer to O'Neill's concept of space colonies.

09:24.900 --> 09:37.300
My 600 kilometer egg shapes with dozens of levels and asteroid cores at the center are much more ambitious than I think Cole came up with it.

09:37.740 --> 09:45.540
And my, also my primary interest was in the kind of social system that might develop within this material container,

09:46.380 --> 09:51.560
because you could have almost any kind of social system you want developing within the economic supports

09:51.560 --> 10:03.680
that are provided by this concept of macro life, the kind of self reproducing space, mobile space colony.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.940
That is, that is in effect a form of life.

10:07.480 --> 10:17.120
It modes, it reproduces, it thinks with its human social component, the possibility seem endless,

10:17.120 --> 10:27.340
especially for something like the idea of revolt within the human generations.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.460
Whenever people would get to the point of dissatisfaction with a particular system they have,

10:33.460 --> 10:47.740
they would simply create another macro world container using the resources and help of the parent and create their own society within it.

10:48.280 --> 10:58.640
It seems to me that this would give the kind of conservatism and stability that is demanded by human beings and social system,

10:58.640 --> 11:10.260
as well as the openness and sense of creativity and adventure that seems to be racking from social systems that become too old and don't want to change.

11:11.260 --> 11:17.420
It seems to be an answer to the problem of what is life for.

11:21.740 --> 11:22.980
It's likely to continue.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.620
If you want to say something more, sure, go ahead.

11:27.740 --> 11:30.000
I think that pretty much covers it.

11:31.080 --> 11:41.960
I would think that the novel gets very deeply into the variations on this basic approach.

11:45.860 --> 11:53.280
It seems to me that there is nothing essentially impossible about developing this kind of mobile society.

11:54.620 --> 12:10.140
It destroys a whole generation of science-fiction concepts which demand that we colonize the planets of other solar systems where I feel if it were possible to do that,

12:10.720 --> 12:19.320
native life might be developing or one day develop and we would be pre-empting possible biological evolution there.

12:19.320 --> 12:25.520
It pre-empts all that kind of science fiction and in fact says that that will never happen.

12:27.540 --> 12:32.340
A whole science-fictional universe dies if you take macro-life seriously.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.860
That brings up a point.

12:38.720 --> 12:47.340
I wanted to talk to you primarily because I read macro-life and it is so terribly original because I've been brought up on the science fiction that you just mentioned.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.940
It does seem to flush it.

12:51.180 --> 13:04.680
Do you think that it has a shot that this idea that unless a culture leaves its dirt world, it's going to be static and not really expand as it could if it did get away and get into something like a macro world?

13:05.580 --> 13:20.520
Well, if the resources of a planet are limited and it has no space-based industry with which to supplement the finitudes of a planetary surface,

13:21.420 --> 13:26.240
then I think the culture will suffer primarily because of the finitude.

13:26.520 --> 13:38.420
As I said, an open exploration-oriented, knowledge-oriented renaissance culture deposits a different kind of world in the human heart.

13:39.260 --> 13:46.200
A limited culture deposits an ecological sixties kind of approach in the human heart.

13:46.200 --> 13:55.300
I think there's a sense of constriction that would develop and take the idea of a zero-growth society.

13:57.080 --> 14:03.300
I see that as essentially static both materially and culturally in the long run.

14:03.400 --> 14:08.040
It would reach a kind of equilibrium with its environment, recycling everything.

14:10.080 --> 14:14.580
That would be the end, I would think, of that kind of culture.

14:14.580 --> 14:22.520
There's no reason why the sun output is tremendous, even if macro life were not to be mobile on the interstellar level.

14:23.100 --> 14:29.240
We could certainly make better use of the sun space within our solar system for this end.

14:31.780 --> 14:35.700
Before we leave the mechanics of writing macro, I want to ask you.

14:35.820 --> 14:41.420
I know that the Cole article and the Stein article appeared in 1961.

14:41.420 --> 14:46.920
Did you read these articles when they appeared? Have you been thinking about this that long or did you pick them up later?

14:47.220 --> 14:50.060
I was thinking about macro life ever since I read the article.

14:51.380 --> 14:54.060
I immediately saw what could be done.

14:55.260 --> 15:01.140
I'm surprised that most science fiction writers still don't see it.

15:01.900 --> 15:05.940
They still feel that we're going to colonize planets on a large scale.

15:05.940 --> 15:12.580
I'm afraid that's a very old, imperialistic idea of colonizing.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.420
I think there will be people who will attempt to do something with planets,

15:17.520 --> 15:24.700
especially if we develop terraforming techniques for the transformation of Venus or the moon.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.920
That sort of thing will go on.

15:28.920 --> 15:32.620
But frankly, it's very difficult.

15:32.620 --> 15:36.340
It all depends on how much energy you have to play around with.

15:36.540 --> 15:43.760
But going to find solar-like planets in other star systems, taking them over,

15:44.780 --> 15:51.880
that really strikes me as a kind of abortion of possible life to come.

15:54.540 --> 16:02.140
So what we have here is a teenager saw a possibility in a magazine that mature science fiction readers,

16:02.500 --> 16:06.240
writers for two decades, afterwards never hit on.

16:07.740 --> 16:13.920
Yeah, by 1970 I had produced various drafts of Part 1.

16:13.920 --> 16:21.440
When I began writing professionally, I realized that I would have to do this book sooner or later.

16:22.080 --> 16:29.400
I decided I would do it and I was always amazed that someone else had not one taken the term

16:30.360 --> 16:32.960
or written anything quite like this.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.820
Now there are macro-life-like books within the field.

16:37.820 --> 16:42.800
The book about cities in flight by James Blush is sort of like that.

16:43.580 --> 16:46.020
But the cities don't reproduce.

16:47.020 --> 16:51.220
They are old Earth cities that simply have taken to wandering around.

16:52.420 --> 16:55.500
It's proto-macro-life of one kind or another.

16:56.340 --> 17:02.480
The ideas have been around, but there's a kind of coherent sociocultural approach

17:02.480 --> 17:08.560
that I think I've taken in that book, which will be the basis of at least six or seven other novels.

17:08.980 --> 17:13.520
Each is very vastly different in technique and form from macro-life.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.740
It has not been copied by anybody.

17:20.300 --> 17:27.080
And I think that if they did copy it in a matter of six or seven months or even a year,

17:27.220 --> 17:31.400
they could not possibly come up with everything that I thought of about it.

17:31.400 --> 17:37.220
In the ten years that the actual writing took, most of the writing took,

17:37.520 --> 17:40.280
happened between 1970 and 1979.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.620
So it's very strange.

17:47.440 --> 17:56.260
I've had such drastic reactions to the book, utter hatred or utter praise,

17:57.020 --> 18:01.700
that I can only echo what I think was Oscar Wilde said,

18:01.740 --> 18:04.380
that when the critics disagree, the artist should be at peace.

18:08.960 --> 18:12.620
You had this idea for years. You wrote on it for ten years.

18:12.980 --> 18:16.040
So you obviously were very enthusiastic about the idea.

18:18.040 --> 18:24.380
In the writing, when I read it, I could tell at times that you could barely restrain your enthusiasm

18:24.380 --> 18:25.820
for the idea that you had.

18:26.620 --> 18:32.240
You didn't ever get preachy at all, but is it difficult to contain your enthusiasm sometimes

18:32.240 --> 18:34.480
and maintain this dispassionate pose?

18:35.400 --> 18:40.120
And we can see the emotions under there, but I think it'd be hard to control them sometimes.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.340
Well, one of the difficulties I had is that Harper and Rowell

18:43.340 --> 18:46.180
was not going to produce a book much over 150-pound words.

18:46.980 --> 18:50.780
I could very easily have produced a book of a thousand printed pages,

18:50.780 --> 18:54.340
and perhaps that might have been more interesting.

18:54.880 --> 19:00.520
That might have been more ruled for character and personal development.

19:01.520 --> 19:07.940
I think it was Arthur Seekh-Vark who, in addition to his enthusiasm for the book,

19:08.200 --> 19:14.980
complimented me on striking a balance between the stapledonian distas

19:14.980 --> 19:17.200
and the personal concerns of the characters.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.300
He put his finger on it.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.640
The problem with the book was to strike some kind of balance between the demands of thought

19:23.640 --> 19:29.060
and the demands of art, or the demands of fiction and the demands of exposition.

19:30.320 --> 19:34.380
But I think your reader can best understand this book

19:34.380 --> 19:40.180
if they don't have a preset notion as to what constitutes fiction

19:40.180 --> 19:46.280
and what constitutes science fiction and how much work they're willing to do in the reading of it.

19:46.280 --> 19:49.540
I don't really think it's all that difficult a book to read.

19:53.880 --> 19:57.780
The original material that you write in the near future,

19:57.900 --> 20:01.760
is that going to be pretty much in this macro world universe?

20:02.580 --> 20:05.640
Well, I have quite a number of books that I have planned.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.620
Many of them vastly different from anything remotely connected with macro.

20:10.860 --> 20:14.720
I think there'll be at least six books against the macro life background.

20:14.720 --> 20:22.980
I think there's sufficient response from readers and sufficient appreciation from readers.

20:23.620 --> 20:26.540
I've talked about 70 reviews of the book worldwide,

20:26.540 --> 20:34.460
and I think maybe half a dozen of them were the nasty kind that I would get from magazines like Locust

20:34.460 --> 20:42.700
or from people like John Clute, either of the great reviewers.

20:44.720 --> 20:50.460
Put us up, put next to the positive reactions. These are lost completely.

20:54.920 --> 20:59.320
To answer your question more specifically, I have many other novels planned.

21:00.180 --> 21:06.440
I think I have about 20 novel projects that I've not developed to the point of submission.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.260
Some of them will be very, very different.

21:11.420 --> 21:17.960
I can't really go into them right now. I assume that they'll be different than what I've done today.

21:21.260 --> 21:25.020
When you have all these ideas floating around in your head written on your notebook,

21:25.400 --> 21:29.020
do you tend to get impatient and want to get them all down at once?

21:29.220 --> 21:32.280
Is it hard to be patient and realize this is a lifelong process?

21:32.280 --> 21:46.160
That's probably the worst part of it, is that I find up, I contracted for many, many books during my late 20s.

21:48.060 --> 21:58.460
And now I am developing in my notebooks books that I think are growing out of much more mature impulses.

22:00.300 --> 22:09.800
And yet I'm still burdened with the completion of contracts that demand that I be faithful to an earlier writer's vision.

22:12.980 --> 22:19.940
Ursula Gwynne told me that I have to get past these books, so they must be done in one way or another.

22:19.940 --> 22:30.940
But I'm nowhere near being able to write the kinds of books that I am planning, say, this year or that I planned last year.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.660
There are half a dozen of them that are like that.

22:34.820 --> 22:42.220
And I think they grow out of a stronger command of technique and of greater sense of human character.

22:43.680 --> 22:54.660
Just a more mature writer is developing these books and I won't be able to get to them until the year after next, at the very least.

22:55.100 --> 22:59.780
So I'm terribly impatient, sometimes I feel that I'll never get to them.

23:00.060 --> 23:03.680
And there are a few books I want to write that have nothing to do with science fiction.

23:04.340 --> 23:25.860
I think every writer of science fiction who is any good begins to feel that here is a certain kind of writing that has swallowed up the possibility of doing a more authentic kind of work that grows directly out of your own experience, that belongs to your own time and your own personal experience.

23:28.640 --> 23:35.000
You read to find writers of the 20th century who do not write science fiction.

23:35.320 --> 23:41.060
And if you're at all imaginative or discerning, you'll see the enormity of their achievement.

23:42.680 --> 23:53.520
And if you want to play in that ballpark too, you may not have the ability, I think, to some degree science fiction to set you apart from that tradition.

23:53.520 --> 23:57.720
But if you're a good writer, I think you will feel the call of that.

23:58.260 --> 24:13.040
Primarily every writer should first think of themselves as a writer and then think of themselves as someone who happens to have written some science fiction, or some poetry, or short fiction, or historical fiction, or detective fiction, whatever.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.360
You have to think of yourself as a writer first.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.580
What's your definition of science fiction?

24:21.340 --> 24:25.700
I think Isaac Asimov came up with about the best one I've ever seen.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.960
And I've developed a, I've explained it a little more to myself.

24:31.180 --> 24:43.140
It simply goes like this, that science fiction is about those aspects of future developments in science and technology, or perhaps in any field of human inquiry.

24:44.900 --> 24:48.580
It's about the human impact of future developments.

24:49.500 --> 24:57.200
The human impact makes it fiction, and the future developments makes it science fiction.

24:57.960 --> 25:11.160
And I think if you stress each of those equally, human developments and future possibilities, then you have a science fiction that is continuous with the rest of literature.

25:11.160 --> 25:19.220
It is not something that is antagonistic towards contemporary fiction, or towards any other kind of science fiction.

25:20.340 --> 25:34.420
I'm afraid that too often genre fiction plays with ideas and has a very childish, naive attitude towards the humanity depicted in the stories.

25:37.620 --> 25:42.840
Where do you see the genre heading in actuality, and where would you like to see it heading?

25:43.640 --> 25:46.740
Well, I think it will pretty much stay the way it is.

25:47.100 --> 25:55.120
According to that definition, you will always have literate science fiction, and you will always have the genre entertainment,

25:56.300 --> 26:02.220
which develops a certain level of cleverness, and perhaps even a certain level of gripping vision.

26:03.820 --> 26:18.580
But if you don't have the human impact, the exploration of the human heart, or the new worlds that are deposited in the human heart and in the human mind,

26:18.700 --> 26:24.780
and if you don't have a certain degree of psychological sophistication, then you will not have literature.

26:24.780 --> 26:37.600
Now, happily, there has always been a literate, high tradition of science fiction from H.T. Weldon, and there has always been the tradition of junkie science fiction.

26:38.720 --> 26:52.940
I have no great fear of the so-called junkie science fiction, or the died-in-the-wool genre fiction, as long as it's well-crafted and shows a certain level of intelligence.

26:52.940 --> 26:56.440
It does not have to fail in those respects.

26:57.400 --> 27:01.100
Somebody like Keith Lommer, for example, shows enormous craftsmanship.

27:01.420 --> 27:10.780
John Brunner, in some of his so-called lesser books, showed enormous craft and intelligence in the working out of genre materials.

27:11.260 --> 27:13.120
There's really nothing wrong with doing that.

27:13.120 --> 27:25.260
But it only gets objectionable when it dominates the field to the tune of 99%, and the serious or literate science fiction is just that squeezed out,

27:27.160 --> 27:33.960
or when some sort of climate develops of absolute hatred for that kind of work.

27:35.660 --> 27:36.820
Let's put it this way.

27:36.980 --> 27:48.100
Any kind of literature is a record of how people regard themselves, and in the case of science fiction, how people regard the future.

27:49.600 --> 28:02.440
150 years from now, the science fiction of today will be a record, a testimony of what we feared about the future, what we hoped for the future, and what we planned for the future.

28:03.520 --> 28:11.880
And that's what makes literature that it bears some kind of testimony to the concerns of its time.

28:11.880 --> 28:17.060
And this is a time that is very future-oriented, so we should have a literature that does that.

28:17.760 --> 28:30.100
A literature which seeks to take all of these serious hopes and fears and to turn it into nothing more than Boy Scouts Among the Stars,

28:30.100 --> 28:42.680
or some sort of pinball game is just betraying everything that I think is ultimately of interest to a reader.

28:44.040 --> 28:52.820
It might be fun, it might be well done, but I think more things can be fun than that.

28:53.700 --> 29:03.300
In the sense that we are in some way envisioning or perhaps contributing to our own futures is I think much more satisfying,

29:03.880 --> 29:10.720
much more fun, much more pleasurable than simply masturbating with a series of conventions.

29:14.520 --> 29:21.140
To conclude, just briefly, I think we'll always have the one kind of science fiction and the other,

29:21.240 --> 29:27.820
just as we'll always have the junky contemporary fiction and the serious literature,

29:28.000 --> 29:32.380
they'll be the ones that get the Nobel Prize and the others.

29:32.760 --> 29:37.080
Happily we do have at least a half a dozen major figures who write science fiction.

29:37.080 --> 29:44.020
Jane Wolf, Philip K. The Late Philip K. Dick, Ursula Gwyn, Spanish Rock Lam,

29:44.960 --> 29:49.920
even Clark, who deserves to be taken seriously down the line.

29:56.540 --> 30:02.100
Okay, one question that I came up with now that we're at the conclusion,

30:02.100 --> 30:05.000
I wanted to ask you about this is back on MacroLife again.

30:05.360 --> 30:14.300
You reported in the afterward to MacroLife that Paul O'Cillare's concept of archaeology inspired your name,

30:14.660 --> 30:16.820
you're naming the first macro world astrome.

30:17.660 --> 30:19.180
What's the background on that?

30:19.940 --> 30:27.320
Well, the archaeology of the Solaria is simply a form of land bound macro life.

30:29.740 --> 30:36.120
They are, as he puts it, one critic put it, they are containers for the human condition.

30:37.100 --> 30:41.680
In other words, deep material supports for a kind of living.

30:42.900 --> 30:49.980
And Dan Rich Cole, who also said that things like submarines or cities, for example,

30:49.980 --> 30:55.040
a city is basically an initial form of macro life.

30:55.820 --> 31:05.300
Since it concentrates human abilities and human aspirations and declares a kind of independence from the countryside.

31:07.180 --> 31:14.700
I use this image in the book by saying that macro life is the ultimate independence of the city

31:14.700 --> 31:22.760
from the countryside, natural planets being countryside, and macro worlds being cities,

31:23.480 --> 31:28.600
except that now they're self-sufficient, whereas the cities on the surface of the earth still depend on the countryside

31:28.600 --> 31:32.380
for their food and energy and whatever.

31:34.280 --> 31:42.680
So Solaria's archaeologies are simply a better form of city, a more efficient humane form of city

31:42.680 --> 31:46.480
that just doesn't grow any which way, but which is planned.

31:47.460 --> 31:53.700
Contrary to the way people regard Solaria's archaeology, because of the vast beehives, they're not.

31:54.460 --> 31:56.500
They are basically containers.

31:57.840 --> 32:04.320
You could take almost any kind of building structures and put them on the shelves of the archaeology.

32:04.580 --> 32:11.100
You could take cities, but you could take buildings that perhaps were common designs in the 19th century.

32:11.100 --> 32:18.320
Two-story wooden frame houses and put them right onto the shelf of the archaeology.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.260
They're open. They're not crowded.

32:23.740 --> 32:29.080
They make use of gravitational drops, waste disposal.

32:30.200 --> 32:38.460
They use land area efficiently so that the rest of the planet can go back to greenery.

32:38.460 --> 32:41.020
Solaria says that's what they want.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.880
People would not really be confined to these cities. They would be able to leave them.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.420
I think they are a form of city that we have simply not tried yet.

32:53.260 --> 32:58.960
In that sense, they're related to macro life and sense that cities are an issue of macro life.
