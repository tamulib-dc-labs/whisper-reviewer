Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.940 --> 00:34.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.720
And here are your hosts.

00:42.680 --> 00:50.400
This is Daryl Lane and David Crews. Poul Anderson is one of a small group of
science fiction authors who have written future histories. A future history is a

00:50.400 --> 00:58.520
group of stories or novels written along a consistent timeline in the future.
Characters may or may not recur, but the intention is to speculate on the

00:58.520 --> 01:06.360
evolution of human society beyond the present day. Anderson actually has written
two future histories. The first is not as best known, and it consists of only a

01:06.360 --> 01:15.960
dozen or so stories. Anderson began it in the late 1940s. But I started out
originally rather

01:15.960 --> 01:37.900
early in my career, and more or less inspired by Heinlein's future history, and
constructed one of my own with charts and background material and so on, like

01:37.900 --> 02:00.820
his. Of course, in mine the events were different. But basically I wanted to do
a similar job that is fictionally tell about the story of mankind from almost

02:00.820 --> 02:16.580
the present day at least until early era of expansion among the stars. This wasn't
going to be the only thing I did by any means, although I would write other

02:16.580 --> 02:18.160
things that were not in the series.

02:32.740 --> 02:41.760
Some of the stories in this future history are Wolf, "Quixote and the Windmill",
Cold Victory, and The Snows of Ganymede. The earliest stories in this series

02:41.760 --> 02:50.380
describe World War III, which Anderson had set in 1958, a war that destroys
modern civilization. But out of the war, decades later, rose a new civilization.

02:50.760 --> 02:59.020
It was a repressive one, dominated by the Psychotechnic Institute, an
organization which strictly plans and controls human progress through

02:59.020 --> 03:07.080
psychological manipulation. Anderson carefully traces out the social, political,
and technological events which shaped the new society. He describes the

03:07.080 --> 03:15.360
colonization of Venus and Mars, for instance, the development of robotics and
artificial regeneration, and the struggle toward a true world government. In one

03:15.360 --> 03:23.740
story, The Troublemakers, he sends a space arc off to Alpha Centauri in a voyage
that will take 123 years. But overall, things don't go smoothly. Anderson

03:23.740 --> 03:31.800
envisions society undergoing many upheavals. In Quixote in the Windmill, for
instance, there are violent anti-robot riots. And in Cold Victory, a humanist

03:31.800 --> 03:39.120
revolution occurs which overthrows a Psychotechnic Institute. But some of the
Institute's people escape to Ganymede, the largest of Jupiter's moons, where

03:39.120 --> 03:47.460
they continue fighting. It isn't until the story break, the last one in this
particular future history, that the Institute is totally wiped out. At this

03:47.460 --> 03:54.720
point, around the 23rd century, the human race is ready to attempt interstellar
colonization. Anderson leaves it there at the beginning of a new era. He

03:54.720 --> 04:07.640
explains why he added no more to it. But gradually, for a number of reasons, got
less and less interested in continuing, and started phasing it out, doing less

04:07.640 --> 04:24.940
and less of it. One reason for being less interested was that, as for the early
part of it, reality was catching up with me. Not only were public or political

04:24.940 --> 04:39.340
events not working out on my timetable, for example, World War III did not come
off on schedule, but also it turned out I had failed to foresee a number of

04:39.340 --> 04:48.960
scientific and technological developments. Anderson's second future history is
much larger and better known. It includes some of the most memorable characters

04:48.960 --> 04:54.660
he's created, like Nicholas van Rijn and Dominic Flandry. We'll talk with
Anderson about that series next time.

05:01.860 --> 05:09.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:09.900 --> 05:10.660
Odessa, Texas.

05:52.180 --> 05:56.140
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.040 --> 06:17.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.880
And here are your hosts.

06:26.380 --> 06:34.580
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. Poul Anderson has written one of the most
ambitious and extensive future histories in science fiction. It's usually called

06:34.580 --> 06:41.240
the future history of the Polesotechnic League, although a better term might be
the League and Empire series. We asked Anderson how the future history got its

06:41.240 --> 06:55.460
start. Now that has a history much more like that of Topsy. It just grew.
Originally, I'd written a few stories about Nicholas van Rijn, and I'd written

06:55.460 --> 07:09.320
a few stories about Dominic Flandry, who lived in completely different milieus,
of course. And then one day on an impulse, I thought, well, gosh, they could be

07:09.320 --> 07:25.640
on the same timeline, one living about 500 years after the other. And threw in
mention of that in one of the Flandry stories. And then started fitting in other

07:25.640 --> 07:39.880
stories wherever it was convenient. You see, the thing with the future history
is that although each story should, of course, be readable independently of any

07:39.880 --> 07:52.640
others and comprehensible and so on, nevertheless, if you have a reader who
remembers a number of them, the cross-connections will add an extra dimension,

07:52.680 --> 07:55.400
and thereby, I hope, add to his enjoyment.

07:58.480 --> 08:14.960
So I started doing it that way. And after a while, I realized I had a rather
large beast by the tail. If I was going to stay consistent at all, then I had to

08:14.960 --> 08:29.980
keep careful notes, and I had to develop a systematic scheme and so on. And
thus, over the years, one thing led to another until it all became rather

08:29.980 --> 08:49.640
elaborate. By now it includes, oh, I think, something like 40 separate items, of
which probably at least a third or so are full-dressed novels. The first story

08:49.640 --> 08:57.820
Nicholas van Rijn turned up in was the novel The Man Who Counts, which was also
issued as The War of the Wingmen. Van Rijn is a non-heroic type. He's a fat,

08:57.920 --> 09:06.200
loud-mouthed, cursing schemer who favors good food, drink, and creature
comforts. But using his wits, he usually conquers all of his foes, human or

09:06.200 --> 09:13.820
alien. He establishes the Polis of Technic League, a trading guild which carries
Earth culture throughout the stars. We asked Anderson if van Rijn has been

09:13.820 --> 09:30.380
popular with readers. Oh, yes. There are some readers who can't stand him, but
they don't ignore him either. And as for the rest, he probably is the most

09:30.380 --> 09:39.440
popular character I've ever come up with. Then, about 500 years along the
timeline of his future history, Anderson introduces Dominic Flandry, an agent

09:39.440 --> 09:48.400
for the Terran Empire. He turns up in books like Ensign Flandry, The Rebel
Worlds, Earthman Go Home, and A Night of Ghosts and Shadows. The Flandry stories

09:48.400 --> 09:56.340
are set in the 31st century and involve the Terran Empire struggle with its
powerful alien antagonist, the Merseians. Flandry is the opposite of van Rijn.

09:56.560 --> 10:05.240
He's smooth, sophisticated, suave, a man who can either fight or scheme with
equal style and flair. He reminds a reader of James Bond. We asked Anderson if

10:05.240 --> 10:14.800
the relationship was intentional. Oh, no. No, I've been asked this before, and
as a matter of fact, the first Flandry story appeared something like 20 years

10:14.800 --> 10:27.200
before the first James Bond story did. If I was modeling on any other character
at all, it would probably have had to be somebody like the Saint. Anderson says

10:27.200 --> 10:34.360
he probably won't be adding any more to the future history of the Polesotechnic
League and the Terran Empire, but there's enough material there already to keep

10:34.360 --> 10:39.140
a science fiction reader busy for a long time. We'll have some more on Poul
Anderson next time.

10:46.480 --> 10:54.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:54.500 --> 10:55.260
Odessa, Texas.

11:36.140 --> 11:40.120
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:56.040 --> 12:01.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:04.180 --> 12:05.920
And here are your hosts.

12:10.280 --> 12:17.640
This is Daryl Lane. And David Crews. A number of science fiction authors employ
the technique of world building in their stories. Poul Anderson is one of the

12:17.640 --> 12:33.300
best at world building. He explains the term. The term simply means to the,
simply refers to the construction of an imaginary world as a setting for a story

12:33.300 --> 12:50.880
in considerable detail. Now, lots of people have done this. An obvious example,
for example, would be J.R.R. Tolkien in The Lord of the Rings and related

12:50.880 --> 13:03.980
stories. He constructs an imaginary world in vast detail, complete down to fine
points of the various languages spoken and so on. Anderson's first extensive

13:03.980 --> 13:11.380
attempt at world building was the planet Diomedes, which was a setting for his
novel, The Man Who Counts. He meticulously constructs the planet in detail that

13:11.380 --> 13:20.100
allows winged intelligent beings. The atmosphere, for example, is very heavy,
which is necessary to support a large flying creature. Anderson explains why he

13:20.100 --> 13:32.880
spends so much time constructing his planets in consistent and careful detail.
After all, we really cannot reasonably expect that any other planet anywhere in

13:32.880 --> 13:44.240
the universe will be very much like Earth. We'll probably be lucky if we find a
few where humans can live without artificial help.

13:46.840 --> 14:04.080
And you're certainly not going to have native humans around there or oak trees
or rabbits or any other feature that we know here on Earth. That's just

14:04.080 --> 14:10.420
preposterous, I suppose, on the basis of everything we know about the evolution
of life here on Earth.

14:14.260 --> 14:30.660
So, in that case, let's try to set up some of the features which are different.
After all, one reason people read science fiction is precisely that they like to

14:30.660 --> 14:38.100
get away from the world around them once in a while and escape into something
exotic. And in my opinion,

14:40.020 --> 14:51.240
to the extent that this exotic thing can be made at the same time realistic and
convincing, the reader is getting his money's worth.

14:57.800 --> 15:05.980
Almost any world constructed by Anderson in his science fiction stories is put
together with attention given to basic scientific laws. Anderson, after all, was

15:05.980 --> 15:14.180
a physics student in college and knows his science. Other authors, Hal Clement
and Larry Niven come to mind, practice careful world building too. In fact,

15:14.320 --> 15:21.460
Clement says his science fiction novel challenges its readers to find any
scientific errors committed by the author. Clement calls this the game. Anderson

15:21.460 --> 15:37.900
elaborates on it. The game consists in an author setting up a world or a
situation or something the very best he can and writing a story about it. And

15:37.900 --> 15:53.160
then that's all he can do. He's made his move and that's it. And readers are
free to, thereafter, to try to figure out from the story exactly what he had in

15:53.160 --> 16:09.660
mind and exactly where he may have gone wrong. So I've gotten some very
interesting mail on technical points. And, yes, sometimes they have indicated to

16:09.660 --> 16:19.400
me that I've goofed on this or that detail, but all right. One learns from that.
I don't mind. With Anderson, and with other world builders, a reader gets a

16:19.400 --> 16:25.580
bonus to accompany an exciting narrative, interesting and accurate science. More
with Poul Anderson in our next show.

16:32.800 --> 16:41.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:41.000 --> 16:41.780
Odessa, Texas.

17:21.740 --> 17:25.760
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:41.980 --> 17:47.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.740
And here are your hosts.

17:56.320 --> 18:05.280
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. Poul Anderson is noted both as a master
world builder and as a creator of believable aliens. He matches aliens to their

18:05.280 --> 18:13.100
planets with meticulous and loving care and with great concern for scientific
accuracy. One of the best examples of his talents in this area is the race of

18:13.100 --> 18:21.320
winged creatures included in his future history of the Polesotechnic League.
Actually, he constructed two separate races of winged beings. The Diomedians

18:21.320 --> 18:28.880
from the Nicholas van Rijn novel, The Man Who Counts, and the Ithrians of the
planet Avalon. Anderson explains how he got interested in intelligent beings

18:28.880 --> 18:46.880
with the ability to fly. Oh, way back when, many years ago, I mean many years
ago, it's about 40 by now, L. Sprague de Camp had published an article on

18:46.880 --> 19:03.740
intelligent non-human beings where he used basic physical principles to demolish
a number of notions, you know, like the idea of a giant insect and so on. It's

19:03.740 --> 19:14.520
just impossible. It would collapse under its own weight because it hasn't got
the structure to support that weight. Things like that. And one thing he doubted

19:14.520 --> 19:18.980
was that you could have an intelligent being which flies

19:23.480 --> 19:38.400
because the wing loading that a living flyer can absorb is or take

19:39.300 --> 19:49.880
is so small that there just wouldn't be room for a sizable brain. Anderson
thought about de Camp's arguments and at last came to at least a partial

19:49.880 --> 20:01.100
solution. Well, science fiction writers tend to take this sort of a thing as a
challenge. And so when I wrote The Man Who Counts quite a while ago,

20:04.480 --> 20:11.020
I did have winged intelligent beings, but I designed the planet such that it had
a very dense atmosphere,

20:13.320 --> 20:26.200
which of course would make it easier to get about in the air. I also made them
essentially six-limbed so that they could have not only wings but legs and

20:26.200 --> 20:38.200
hands. Well, afterward I got to thinking that that had been a kind of a cop-out.
Couldn't there be some way to do it better? Could it conceivably be done on an

20:38.200 --> 20:50.420
Earth-like planet? I couldn't see any way. De Camp's arguments were there and
they made sense. At this point, the famous science fiction editor, John W.

20:50.580 --> 21:05.860
Campbell, came to the rescue. Well, then it happened the very last time I saw
the late John W. Campbell. I was in New York and visited his office and we went

21:05.860 --> 21:16.840
out to lunch together. This was not long before his death. And we sat there
talking. And during their conversation, Anderson brought up the problem of

21:16.840 --> 21:25.880
constructing a large intelligent creature who could fly. Campbell suggested a
way to do it. And he immediately said, Well, suppose it had some sort of leg

21:25.880 --> 21:30.440
-driven supercharging

21:30.440 --> 21:33.600
bellows. That would give it tremendous cursive ability.

21:36.380 --> 21:50.000
And I immediately saw that this was a way to power a winged animal, give it
sufficient energy, that it actually could fly in an atmosphere like our own.

21:52.720 --> 22:02.120
Although it might weigh as much as 100 pounds. So on this hint, Anderson created
the Ithrians of the planet Avalon. The People of the Wind is probably the best

22:02.120 --> 22:10.580
known of his novels involving the Ithrians, but Anderson used them in a number
of stories in his Polesotechnic League future history. Next time we'll have more

22:10.580 --> 22:11.300
with Poul Anderson.

22:18.540 --> 22:26.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:26.640 --> 22:34.140
Odessa, Texas. 

23:07.600 --> 23:11.620
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.280
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.800
And here are your hosts.

23:42.120 --> 23:49.580
This is Daryl Lane. And David Crews. One of the present masters of science
fiction and fantasy, an author whose work stretches back four decades into the

23:49.580 --> 23:56.700
golden age of science fiction, is Poul Anderson. It's hard to type Anderson.
He's a full-time professional who writes all kinds of fantasy and science

23:56.700 --> 24:05.500
fiction. He's known as a writer of hard science, for example, which can be seen
in novels like Tau Zero or The Man Who Counts, a fine example of world building.

24:05.780 --> 24:13.220
He's constructed two future histories. The best-known one, the history of the
Polesotechnic League, contains some of his most famous characters and some of

24:13.220 --> 24:21.300
his most fascinating alien cultures. Some of the best of contemporary fantasy
comes from his pen also, in novels like The Broken Sword and Three Hearts and

24:21.300 --> 24:29.180
Three Lions. And he sometimes writes tongue-in-cheek spooks, as in his novel The
High Crusade, in which some medieval warriors with swords conquer a space-faring

24:29.180 --> 24:36.900
galactic civilization. Anderson has won numerous Nebula and Hugo Awards for his
fiction, and he served as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America.

24:36.960 --> 24:45.000
He knows the field like few others do. We asked him if science fiction has
changed in the years he's been writing it. Oh, yes, there have been a great many

24:45.000 --> 24:45.720
changes.

24:49.000 --> 25:03.320
Back around 1940 or so, well, practically all you could get, unless you hark
back to a few writers like Wells and Verne, and practically all you could get

25:03.320 --> 25:05.620
was in a few pulp magazines.

25:11.160 --> 25:24.880
Nowadays, of course, there's an overwhelming flood of it. It is not possible to
read all which appears. Anderson thinks the image of science fiction has changed

25:24.880 --> 25:34.220
over the years. And also, of course, it's no longer disreputable. It's become
quite respectable.

25:37.140 --> 25:49.380
You know, when I was your age, it was unthinkable that anybody could arrange a
telephone interview with one of the writers of it under the auspices of a

25:49.380 --> 26:05.280
college, for heaven's sake. Good Lord, this was pulp fiction. It was beyond the
pale. Nowadays, it's being taught in college courses and all this other stuff,

26:05.400 --> 26:05.780
you know.

26:32 --> 26:37
He believes that science fiction has had an important impact on the public.
And tells us why he thinks all science fiction is valuable.

26:33.040 --> 26:46.360
Actually, all this is kind of trivial. I think the important thing is that the

26:46.360 --> 27:07.660
basic concepts have sort of permeated the public mind. And I think people are
aware nowadays in a way that they never used to be aware that the future is

27:07.660 --> 27:17.780
going to be different from the past. It may be better. It may be worse.
Whatever. But it's going to be different and in very fundamental ways.

27:20.160 --> 27:37.640
And they tend to accept this, be prepared for it. I often say that perhaps the
most important public service that science fiction is doing is by casting a

27:37.640 --> 27:51.580
certain glamour over science and technology. It recruits a lot of young people
into these fields. And good heaven knows we need an awful lot of scientists and

27:51.580 --> 27:56.960
technologists. Anderson is still going strong today. You'll find his latest work
at any bookstore.
