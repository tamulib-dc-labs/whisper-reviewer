00:03.380 --> 00:06.800
But step timing, you couldn't, and George Powell's died from.

00:07.100 --> 00:07.400
Right.

00:07.640 --> 00:13.120
However, I understand that somebody else is now contemplating making one.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.580
In fact, they're working on the treatment right now.

00:17.640 --> 00:21.640
Wonder if it'll have Bo Derek in it like the new Tarzan movie's gonna have.

00:22.380 --> 00:24.400
Yeah, I don't think the Tarzan movie ever comes out.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.880
Yeah, again, as David said, we'll want to keep it real informal.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.840
And what we're shooting for in our national form started, okay.

00:30.960 --> 00:31.580
Tapes rolling.

00:31.760 --> 00:32.600
Tapes rolling.

00:33.620 --> 00:36.360
Mr. Farmer, how'd you get started writing science fiction?

00:37.920 --> 00:42.540
Well, I started reading science fiction when I was seven years old.

00:42.780 --> 00:44.120
I'm 63 now.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.060
And I knew I always wanted to be a writer.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.900
Well, I didn't do much about it for many years.

00:53.220 --> 00:58.020
The funny thing is, I actually intended to become a mainstream writer.

00:58.180 --> 01:02.220
That is, to write stories which are not in particular genre.

01:03.260 --> 01:05.980
But somehow, I just just did into science fiction.

01:07.060 --> 01:10.680
And sold my first science fiction story in 1952.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.020
That was called The Lovers.

01:13.300 --> 01:18.500
It was a novel that was published in a magazine.

01:18.500 --> 01:26.340
And it's generally credited with breaking the taboo against the mature use of sex in science fiction magazine.

01:30.440 --> 01:37.880
And I've been writing since 1952, but I always held a job down up until 1969.

01:38.420 --> 01:46.100
I was a tech writer for the McDonald Douglas Company working for the space industry.

01:46.100 --> 01:50.220
I was in Los Angeles when, a month before the first moon landing,

01:51.160 --> 01:58.560
they laid off the thousands and thousands of workers in the space defense industry, you may recall that.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.500
And like all the rest, I was out of a job.

02:02.700 --> 02:06.740
But I'd been writing all those years, weekends, evenings.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.900
I had a pretty good backlog and built up something of a reputation by then.

02:12.060 --> 02:13.000
So I decided to freelance.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.100
And I found a job.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.720
It would have been a very good job with a civilian outfit.

02:22.180 --> 02:25.680
But I said to the heck with it, and became a freelancer.

02:25.680 --> 02:28.800
And it's been so since about June 1969.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.640
You mentioned that The Lovers was your first work.

02:36.460 --> 02:42.980
And it, and you did make...

02:42.980 --> 02:44.180
45, I think.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.840
You mentioned that it was known for breaking the taboos.

02:49.220 --> 02:53.700
Did you consciously set out to write such a story, or is that just how it developed?

02:55.240 --> 03:01.020
No, I had an idea for a story, and I couldn't write it unless I broke the taboos.

03:01.120 --> 03:07.740
I didn't really consciously set out to do it because I had the idea, and I thought it was terrific.

03:07.740 --> 03:11.340
On the other hand, I knew I was going to have a lot of trouble getting as accepted.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.920
I did. I did have a lot of trouble.

03:16.720 --> 03:20.920
The first editor I sent it to, John Campbell, who was the editor of The Stounding,

03:22.540 --> 03:25.260
was the most prestigious and highest paying market.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.080
Naturally, I sent it to him first.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.800
And he returned it with a comment that I'm not a editing.

03:32.460 --> 03:41.100
So I sent it to Horace Gold, who was editing Galaxy, which was equally prestigious and had about the same word rates.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.940
His comments were something like John Campbell's.

03:46.120 --> 03:52.480
Then I sent it to Samuel Mayans, who was editor of a magazine called Starling Stories.

03:55.080 --> 03:59.620
He immediately accepted it and knew it was a revolutionary breakthrough.

04:00.340 --> 04:03.500
He published it and I was on my way.

04:05.020 --> 04:08.900
Accepted the next story I wrote was also equally revolutionary.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.040
It took me a year before I could get anybody to accept it.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.780
A lot of your other stories in that time opened to me.

04:19.900 --> 04:25.240
My sister and flesh and mother come to mind as stories in the same vein.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.160
Can you talk a little longer?

04:30.160 --> 04:30.920
Yes, I can.

04:33.200 --> 04:37.640
You've also written a number of pieces that revolve around a religious theme.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.740
The first story, The Lovers.

04:40.680 --> 04:48.180
And then the book that just came out, Father to the Stars, the stories of Father John Carmody, which had finally been collected.

04:48.740 --> 04:50.320
A Woman of Day, Jesus on Mars.

04:51.260 --> 04:56.840
Do you have strong feelings about religion, one way or the other, to include it in your work so much?

04:57.720 --> 04:59.060
Well, I must.

04:59.060 --> 05:08.000
I was sent to Sunday school when I was very little and I became interested in the Bible and I read it on my own.

05:08.740 --> 05:11.820
And I even read the Book of Mormon when I was about nine years old.

05:13.060 --> 05:24.360
And I always wrestled all my life with the problems of immortality, tree destination, grace, gastro-life and all that sort of stuff.

05:24.360 --> 05:32.420
I was raised as a Christian scientist up until the time I was about twelve.

05:33.720 --> 05:45.540
And then I was sent to a Presbyterian church where there was a conflict between Christian science and the Presbyterian idea of predestination.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.740
And then when I was about sixteen, I guess I became an atheist.

05:51.200 --> 05:58.960
I've gone through atheism, through agnosticism, and then I was converted to the disciples of Christ.

06:00.480 --> 06:07.120
Then I backslid, all from grace, as the theological term goes.

06:08.140 --> 06:10.740
And then I lapsed back into agnosticism.

06:12.600 --> 06:18.540
My present situation is that without immortality life has no meaning.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.220
If there's a creation there must be a creator.

06:23.360 --> 06:30.780
But I've become tremendously interested in what is sometimes referred to as mythism.

06:30.780 --> 06:37.680
It isn't really like the Muslims, the Muslims Sufism school.

06:40.020 --> 06:42.920
Then a lot of related stuff like that.

06:44.720 --> 06:51.100
You might see right now I'm in a sort of a limbo, heading towards something I don't know what.

06:51.220 --> 06:55.480
But anyway, my interest in religion has manifested itself throughout all my work.

06:57.460 --> 07:02.640
Although a lot of people when they say the name farmer immediately think of sex in a book,

07:03.020 --> 07:07.420
the fact is I've written much more about religion than about sex.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.160
Or sometimes both at the same time.

07:12.220 --> 07:17.920
Something in some respects, sex and religion are two sides of the same coin.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.300
In certain fields of activity.

07:24.120 --> 07:24.820
Father John.

07:25.860 --> 07:27.100
You're doing fine, yeah.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.120
Okay, I'll do another question now.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.460
Father John Carmody seems to be making a comeback.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.900
Will there be more stories of him appearing pretty soon?

07:36.540 --> 07:38.380
There will be, but not soon.

07:38.700 --> 07:43.420
Because I've got so many contracts and so many ideas for other stories.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.560
It'll be a couple of years before I get around to it.

07:45.560 --> 07:53.840
See, when I wrote the last Father John Carmody story about the Roman Catholic interstellar priest,

07:55.200 --> 08:02.260
that must have been at least 15 years ago, and I left the poor guy up and hanging up in the middle of space

08:02.260 --> 08:03.840
with an egg growing from his chest.

08:05.160 --> 08:09.840
I always wanted to bring him down and write about three more stories and finish up that series.

08:10.600 --> 08:18.860
The one thing is, by actual count, I started 15 series and never really finished any of them.

08:20.940 --> 08:23.740
So it depends on how long I live, whether I finish it or not.

08:25.340 --> 08:31.400
You mentioned while I go that the afterlife has a bit of interest for you inside, outside,

08:31.680 --> 08:33.920
and of course the river world books come to mind here.

08:34.660 --> 08:36.320
Are these related in any way?

08:37.720 --> 08:46.540
Uh, you mean are they related in that they're in the same universe?

08:47.180 --> 08:53.380
Yeah, you took the idea, the afterlife idea, and it diverged in the two different ways.

08:54.060 --> 08:55.300
Yeah, that's what I've done.

08:55.920 --> 09:03.620
I've varied the idea or done variations on the same theme, you might say, as far as afterlife goes.

09:05.240 --> 09:11.320
Well, if you think about it, there could be a million different possibilities in an afterlife, in their work.

09:12.280 --> 09:23.060
But one of my perhaps un-stated themes is that immortality may not depend upon a supernatural being.

09:23.060 --> 09:31.460
That's the evolutionary drive of a man for him to invent immortality himself.

09:34.020 --> 09:38.580
The drawback to that is, those people who are already dead will remain dead, right?

09:38.940 --> 09:49.400
So that doesn't correspond to the religious idea of immortality, where everybody is raised from the first human being to the last one.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.140
I like to do a lot of variations on that.

09:53.580 --> 10:00.140
I have a new book coming out in Pesms in September called The Un-Reasoning Mask.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.060
That's the quotation you will be picked.

10:02.920 --> 10:10.600
And this is concerned with theology, astral life, immortality.

10:11.740 --> 10:15.380
You might call it a philosophical, theological space opera.

10:18.240 --> 10:25.060
I don't sort of ever really abandon that theme, but then again, that's just one of the many things I have in my work.

10:26.580 --> 10:39.040
One of the reasons I've had trouble in the early days, I think, really becoming identified and getting banned of followers is that I didn't beat on just one or two drums.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.820
I've arranged all over the field.

10:41.960 --> 10:56.460
I've written a lot of what I would call venture science fiction, in addition to experimental science fiction, theological, philosophical, sexual, biological, you name it.

10:58.640 --> 11:08.500
What I find out is if I do a variety of stuff and don't get tired, each new novel is a new challenge.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.700
I'm not just working the same old theme again.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.140
Will you continue to do some River World stories?

11:16.380 --> 11:19.920
I know the novels are finished, but what about the stories?

11:19.920 --> 11:36.460
Well, what I did in the first Four Books of the River World series was I wrote the Magic Labyrinth, and that presumably answered the questions about the main mystery throughout the Four Books.

11:38.160 --> 11:55.260
But the River World concept is so big, perhaps for those who aren't familiar with it, I should say that it concerns the planet in which there's a 10 million mile long river which follows the valley.

11:57.860 --> 12:10.180
Everybody has lived from about 150,000 B.C. to about 1883 A.D. was resurrected along the Bangsley River in rejuvenated form, looked like they were 25.

12:11.460 --> 12:22.960
The main mystery behind the whole thing was why were all these people resurrected? Who did it and how?

12:23.920 --> 12:38.860
That was answered in the final one, but the thing is that there are so many themes that I wanted to explore during the course of those four novels, but I couldn't do it because I would have slowed the story down too much.

12:40.260 --> 12:46.080
I wasn't taking too many side tracks, you might say, and I'd still be working on that particular series.

12:46.420 --> 12:57.200
So what I want to do is to write two more books in which I can extrapolate various themes that I couldn't give any attention to during the course of the four books.

13:02.180 --> 13:10.880
I didn't go into any detail on how you could work out viable societies with people from every place and every time.

13:12.280 --> 13:21.400
I also wanted to bring up in depth what would happen to famous people on that planet.

13:21.400 --> 13:27.660
Like, uh, what would Karl Marx think for instance, if he could see what had happened to ideas and comedies?

13:37.320 --> 13:41.860
Marx and that, uh, okay, yeah, I just started with Karl Marx. Okay, we're on the air now, Mr. Farmer.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.620
Uh, yeah, okay, your voice is fading away again.

13:45.080 --> 13:49.100
Okay, it's my fault because I had the phone away from me. Okay, let's go now.

13:51.100 --> 14:01.800
Well, there's Karl Marx for instance, uh, what would he think of what happened to his ideas about communism on the planet Earth after he died?

14:03.880 --> 14:15.000
Leonardo da Vinci, his ideas about art, what's the fact that he's on a planet where there are very few pigments available for instance for him to paint?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
What would he do there?

14:17.860 --> 14:31.460
Um, I also wanted to bring up various figures from science and the military and philosophy and so forth and show what they would do there.

14:31.940 --> 14:42.240
Now, one of the things about the river world was that although you were born, uh, actually they weren't, although you were resurrected there in a youthful body of your own,

14:42.240 --> 14:57.540
as it was in 25 or earlier if you died before 25, uh, if you did, for instance, you were 83 when you were dying, when your mind was still 83 and you have 83 years of experience on Earth behind you.

14:58.120 --> 15:07.540
Uh, now, is your character formed? Are you going to go through perhaps a thousand years being the same person?

15:07.540 --> 15:28.300
Or are you going to improve? But it's evident in this, in the river world series that, uh, some ethical standards are being set by unknown people and that it's up to each individual to advance in a mental and spiritual state to progress.

15:28.980 --> 15:38.400
Uh, what I tried to point out was that some people were absolutely incapable of progressing, they remained fixed, others regressed and a few progressed.

15:39.960 --> 15:51.560
So, uh, I wanted to show that theme too. As a matter of fact, there would be about 25 or 30 things that I couldn't develop in the four books of the main series.

15:52.800 --> 16:00.200
Uh, there was a lot that happened on the two boats, the one to develop the society of the two boats, for instance, they went up the river.

16:01.380 --> 16:02.820
I could have a lot of fun with that.

16:04.400 --> 16:09.840
So, uh, I plan on writing two more, what I call, side-stream stories.

16:11.160 --> 16:14.920
Stories take place in the river world, but they're not connected with the main mystery.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.520
Just allow me to develop things that I couldn't otherwise.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.180
Also, I made a lot of people mad at me.

16:23.180 --> 16:31.620
Uh, because of that last sentence, or paragraph, I should say, I wrote in the Magic Labyrinth, everything seems to have been settled.

16:33.240 --> 16:43.200
Uh, everything has been cleared up, and then one of the, uh, characters, the kind of minor one, Peter Juris Frigate,

16:44.460 --> 16:50.880
he's celebrating with the others in the mystery tar when he thinks he hears a football outside in the hallway,

16:52.300 --> 16:58.000
goes out, comes back, and says to the others, they didn't see anyone, it must have been my imagination.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.920
A lot of readers got mad at me because they thought, oh no, he's going to write another one.

17:02.840 --> 17:06.200
He's leaving a loophole. Well, I am leaving a loophole.

17:06.200 --> 17:16.560
I don't know whether I'll go through it or not, but it's quite possible that the Magic Labyrinth wasn't the final one in that series before,

17:16.720 --> 17:26.240
that everything that our protagonist learns and everything that everybody else learns is completely untrue, or half-true.

17:27.920 --> 17:34.460
But I haven't decided whether I'll go on or not. In any event, I'm going to write two side-stream stories about the river world.

17:35.680 --> 17:43.540
Your mind must be a vast storehouse of these historical characters, because in the river world books, you really provide a lot of background about them.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.100
That must interest you as well.

17:46.180 --> 17:52.650
Well, uh, well, you see, I did research on them, of course, but on the other hand, I've been doing research all my life,

17:52.650 --> 18:05.710
because like a majority of science fiction writers, I'm a very voracious reader, not just in the fields of science, but all fields.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.990
And I've always been interested in history and biography.

18:10.390 --> 18:18.270
So much so that I think that that's what led me into starting genealogical research, which has recently been in my own family.

18:19.410 --> 18:29.010
And I found out and I can prove that I'm descended from Abraham Lincoln's great-great-grandfather and Daniel Boone's aunt.

18:30.870 --> 18:32.830
That kind of tickled me when I found that out.

18:35.470 --> 18:39.230
But that's just one more evidence of my interest in history and biography.

18:40.330 --> 18:52.030
I did give a lot of detail about a lot of historical figures there, but I also, you know, once in a while, slipped in very brief mentions of obscure figures in history.

18:52.970 --> 18:57.210
I guess it would take a historian to recognize them right away, and it doesn't matter if you don't.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.330
I just like to play that little game.

19:02.910 --> 19:13.830
You've also written a lot about Tarzan, our Tarzan-like protagonist, and as a matter of fact, Tarzan seems to be related to a lot of historical figures too.

19:14.450 --> 19:24.790
How did you get interested in the Tarzan or Tarzan-like characters, and then this idea of having them being related to everybody else from the pulp era and whatnot?

19:33.510 --> 19:43.710
I first read Tarzan when I guess I was about seven or eight years old, and I became wrapped up in that early age with the words of, like, your rice burrows.

19:46.550 --> 19:56.210
But when I started college, I kind of lost interest in reading music more, but I was in Los Angeles.

19:57.370 --> 20:10.210
I really reprinted the Doc Savage books. Doc Savage was the pulp fiction hero, the early 30s, 40s.

20:11.790 --> 20:18.530
When they started reprinting those books, I started reading them again.

20:19.970 --> 20:26.770
And of course, not being young anymore and having read a great deal, I could see the flaws in them.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.250
Type of writing, I heard, but they were still a lot of fun.

20:32.650 --> 20:46.470
And I started reading books about Tarzan again, and this time, although I still kept a lot of my childhood interest in them,

20:46.470 --> 20:52.910
I had a sense of wonder about them. I began seeing things in Tarzan, for instance, and I had not seen before.

20:54.770 --> 21:01.410
It was not just a creature, or an ant, pardon me, what I bet it is.

21:01.790 --> 21:10.930
It was not just a child who'd been cast away and raised by great apes and then become a creature of the jungle,

21:11.310 --> 21:22.830
and then returned to claim his fortune. He was sort of an archetype of many, many heroes from classical myth.

21:24.030 --> 21:28.690
And now, I'm sure that when Burroughs wrote this, he didn't know what he was doing, but he did it unconsciously.

21:29.310 --> 21:32.230
I think that in the creation of Tarzan, he was just a genius.

21:33.110 --> 21:40.610
Burroughs is not a great writer, but he has created a great character just like Acorn and Doyle is not a great writer,

21:40.750 --> 21:44.490
but he created a great character, Sherlock Holmes.

21:45.390 --> 21:57.590
I started delving into the mythology and found many striking resemblances between Tarzan and the heroes of the ancient Greek myths,

21:57.590 --> 22:00.390
and the Sumerian and the Babylonian, and so forth.

22:01.890 --> 22:04.930
Also, I've always read a lot of anthropology, a lot of folklore.

22:05.850 --> 22:15.510
It was a great deal resemblance between Tarzan and various figures in North American, Indian folklore, and African folklore, and so forth.

22:16.730 --> 22:22.390
And at the same time, I started, well, I never really had to quit reading Sherlock Holmes,

22:22.390 --> 22:32.510
but I found out about the Baker Street Journal, which publishes, it's quarterly, and it publishes scholarly, pseudo-scholarly, articles about Holmes.

22:34.030 --> 22:34.370
Okay.

22:36.170 --> 22:40.990
Then I came across a biography of Scarlett Tempernell.

22:41.870 --> 22:48.830
This is the first of biographies about fictional characters making the assumption that these people really lived.

22:49.890 --> 22:59.510
Then I came across the Bering Bulls biography of Sherlock Holmes, and the biography of Miro Woff.

23:00.190 --> 23:01.530
So I thought, well, ain't Greek.

23:03.170 --> 23:04.890
I'll write a biography of Tarzan.

23:05.210 --> 23:12.350
Now, the assumption there is that he really lived, and once you make that assumption that he's not a fictional character,

23:12.350 --> 23:18.090
then immediately you have to reconcile all of discrepancies and the novels about Tarzan.

23:18.150 --> 23:19.490
You have to investigate his background.

23:21.710 --> 23:28.550
You have to write it as if it were a detailed work of research, which, by the way, it was.

23:29.290 --> 23:37.950
Ted Sturgeon said that I didn't know working in my biography of Tarzan to earn any 12 PhDs or degrees.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.370
That's true, but I had a lot of fun with it.

23:40.670 --> 23:46.810
Then I started seeing various resemblances between Tarzan and the other characters.

23:47.630 --> 23:57.090
So the first thing you know, I had conceived this idea of what I call the Wall Newton family, which is almost all the great characters of the fiction.

23:57.290 --> 23:58.090
A lot of history.

23:58.950 --> 24:00.870
We're descended from the Scarlett Tempernell.

24:02.430 --> 24:09.930
And I drew up a genealogical map, table, and then I explained it in various dependencies.

24:11.530 --> 24:17.370
And then when I did my Doc Savage biography, I extended that genealogical table.

24:19.670 --> 24:30.390
Proving Tarzan is related to, not only Scarlett Tempernell, but Sherlock Holmes, and Newell Wolfe, or Lord Peter Wimsey.

24:32.910 --> 24:35.390
One of the heroes of Jack London novel.

24:36.330 --> 24:37.770
And on and on and on.

24:38.370 --> 24:40.730
I had a lot of fun with it, and apparently the readers did too.

24:42.930 --> 24:45.970
On the other hand, I really believed Tarzan is alive.

24:49.030 --> 24:55.110
I believe Kilgore Trout is related to some people in the Wall Newton family, isn't he?

24:55.710 --> 24:58.090
Boy, a man of his great genius has to be.

24:58.090 --> 25:05.170
He's in the genealogical chart in the Doc Savage book, I think, the Revised Book.

25:07.930 --> 25:10.650
You seem to identify a bit with Kilgore Trout.

25:12.630 --> 25:18.770
Well, the reason for that is, well, in the first place, I was a fan of Sonic, as you know, I like all those books.

25:18.930 --> 25:26.270
But Kilgore Trout really turned me on because his early experiences, as a matter of fact, his later ones, too,

25:26.270 --> 25:36.070
were like a lot of my early experiences, and a lot of the experiences with many other science fiction writers back in the old days,

25:36.290 --> 25:40.170
weren't being paid much, and science fiction was looked down upon.

25:41.210 --> 25:46.270
And we were being taken due to our inexperience with various publishers and agents.

25:48.510 --> 25:51.190
I also had a tough time getting any recognition.

25:52.110 --> 25:55.410
So, I guess that's why you identified with him.

25:55.730 --> 25:57.110
What's the fact that he's a great character?

26:00.130 --> 26:01.050
I believe I...

26:01.050 --> 26:01.850
That's somewhat sad.

26:04.210 --> 26:08.830
I believe I recall that you were going to write The Son of Jimmy Valentine.

26:09.670 --> 26:12.370
Wasn't that Trout's one and only dirty book?

26:13.610 --> 26:21.970
It was his...not only his one and only specifically erotic book, it was also his only non-science fiction book.

26:27.310 --> 26:32.850
But Vonnegut...I don't know what is his reaction to the art of the novel itself, but...

26:32.850 --> 26:38.970
So many people thought, and he'd written it, and he'd tell you hundreds and maybe thousands of places.

26:40.290 --> 26:41.690
Then the reviews came out.

26:42.490 --> 26:45.010
Tom said, Venus on the hash shelf, I killed her, Trout.

26:46.810 --> 26:50.410
It was the worst thing he'd written, and others said it was the best thing he'd ever written.

26:52.290 --> 26:57.810
When I applied for permission to write The Son of Jimmy Valentine, which I really would have loved to have done,

26:57.930 --> 26:59.430
I could have had a lot of fun with it.

27:00.750 --> 27:01.550
He said, no.

27:02.650 --> 27:03.870
Which is his bureaucracy?

27:06.590 --> 27:09.970
However, that didn't stop me from writing about fiction and authors.

27:13.610 --> 27:22.610
In the Venus on the hash shelf, the protagonist, Simon Lagstaff, had his favorite science fiction authors.

27:23.710 --> 27:32.990
Just as in Vonnegut's books, Elliot Rose Water, thought that Gilbert Trout was the greatest living writer in any field.

27:32.990 --> 27:35.590
He should have been president of the US, he couldn't have solved all the problems.

27:36.430 --> 27:46.630
Well anyway, in Venus on the hash shelf, Simon Lagstaff liked to read the science fiction works of a fellow called Jonathan Swiss Summers III.

27:47.570 --> 27:52.790
And I describe his various works, or outlinem, and give the titles.

27:53.590 --> 28:07.790
But Jonathan Swiss Summers, who's a fiction author, wrote about a giant German shepherd police dog whose IQ had been raised to about 200 in a laboratory, and he became a private detective.

28:09.270 --> 28:19.230
Now, I plan eventually someday on writing a book by Ralph von Baubau, this dog, under the name of Ralph von Baubau.

28:20.830 --> 28:33.050
And then maybe I'll end the cycle by having Ralph von Baubau write about a human named Vonnegut, something like that, and completing it, going right back to Vonnegut again.

28:36.070 --> 28:38.110
I hope I'm making myself clear.

28:39.210 --> 28:44.630
I believe Gilbert Trout has a cousin named Leo Tencrouter that does some writing too, doesn't he?

28:44.830 --> 28:46.930
Yeah, Leo Quik-Quig Tencrouter.

28:47.850 --> 28:58.390
Well, as a matter of fact, I wrote some stories about, and with Tencrouter figured, as a character, and I outlined two of his stories.

28:58.850 --> 29:07.290
And then later on, lo and behold, this story appeared in an anthology by Robert Silverberg, in which he collaborated with me.

29:08.010 --> 29:09.590
It's called A Cyrus and Crutches.

29:12.370 --> 29:14.150
See, this could go on and on.

29:14.370 --> 29:35.910
I mean, every time you write a story under a nom de plume, that of a fictional author, let's say Gilbert Trout or David Copperfield, these fictional authors can write about their fictional authors, and then you can write stories in which these fictional authors have written stories.

29:35.910 --> 29:39.610
In other words, you can go through various stages.

29:40.370 --> 29:43.190
Like, Vonnegut wrote about Gilbert Trout.

29:43.990 --> 29:46.390
I wrote a book by Gilbert Trout.

29:46.510 --> 29:52.130
Gilbert Trout's book describes a science fiction author who had a character in his stories.

29:52.510 --> 29:55.510
This character writes his story, and so on and so on.

29:58.870 --> 30:07.430
One of the funny things about this is that I found out that I could use the fictional author device to break a writing block.

30:07.750 --> 30:13.850
I had a writing block once, that terrible thing that sometimes happens to writers.

30:15.110 --> 30:17.790
They don't know what caused it, for some reason.

30:18.530 --> 30:23.130
They might have many ideas, be eager to go, but when they sit down in front of a typewriter, nothing happens.

30:24.550 --> 30:26.790
Well, that happened to me once.

30:27.730 --> 30:30.430
I never thought it would. I thought I was immune to such a thing.

30:31.150 --> 30:31.530
But it did.

30:32.530 --> 30:37.030
And after a wrestling for two months and getting in no place, I had an idea.

30:38.730 --> 30:48.450
I sat down with a typewriter and wrote a story, not by Philip Ozy Farmer, but by David Copperfield, I'd say.

30:49.310 --> 30:51.450
I don't remember which particular nom de plume it is.

30:53.410 --> 30:54.910
The story poured out.

30:56.670 --> 30:57.350
Very good.

30:58.010 --> 30:59.130
I thought so anyway.

31:00.610 --> 31:03.570
When I'd completed that, the writing block was gone.

31:04.090 --> 31:09.650
See, I wasn't writing then as me, Philip Ozy Farmer, but as I say, Gilbert Trout.

31:10.950 --> 31:13.430
And I was in his shoes. I had no trouble.

31:13.430 --> 31:21.570
The funny thing about this is, it's a psychological trick that I'm conscious of.

31:24.070 --> 31:25.450
And yet it works.

31:27.390 --> 31:32.030
It's not like I'm trying to trick my unconscious, but I must be doing it one way or another.

31:34.350 --> 31:40.810
Well, I don't know of anybody else who's ever broken a writer's block in that manner, but I recommend trying it.

31:44.090 --> 31:49.430
Will you be moving on to the mainstream, as it was once reported, that you might be considering?

31:53.230 --> 31:57.390
Well, as I said, when I started out writing, I wanted to be a mainstream writer.

31:59.010 --> 32:03.330
Back in my youthful, foolish days, I had aspirations to be the American.

32:04.070 --> 32:06.590
Toskiesky, or Nusmalville, all that sort of stuff.

32:10.010 --> 32:17.270
I'm not confined to science fiction. I have written some stuff that wasn't for the mainstream.

32:19.110 --> 32:28.090
And I got this idea about two years ago for writing a mainstream novel, which would be called Pearl Diving in Old Curia.

32:28.810 --> 32:33.730
And this would take place in Curia, Illinois, where I lived, would be in the early 50s.

32:33.730 --> 32:42.930
But I regard as containing the seed of the movement, which later on became very manifest in the 60s,

32:43.130 --> 32:46.570
a shift in the zeitgeist and the attitude at the time.

32:48.230 --> 32:59.370
And some ways, Curia, the city where I've lived most of my life, will be a sort of a protagonist, I'd say.

32:59.990 --> 33:01.170
But it's a novel.

33:01.170 --> 33:03.270
It's not in the documentary.

33:05.090 --> 33:07.070
I have great hopes for it.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.990
In any event, next year I'm going to write it.

33:10.830 --> 33:17.150
And I sold two mainstream stories to Playboy and one to Mystery Magazine.

33:17.750 --> 33:26.670
Back in 57, I wrote a mainstream novel called Fire in the Night about racial relations in the steel mill,

33:28.230 --> 33:35.190
which is obviously based on the steel mill, which is right outside Peoria, and where I worked for 11 years.

33:37.230 --> 33:39.590
So, yes, I want to get into mainstream.

33:40.390 --> 33:43.090
Oh, I don't intend to quit writing science fiction.

33:46.010 --> 33:49.450
I have too many ideals for science fiction stories to quit.

33:49.790 --> 33:53.650
I have enough to keep me going if I live to be a hundred.

33:53.650 --> 33:55.950
Every day I keep getting new ones.

33:56.530 --> 33:57.410
New ideas.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.650
Where do you see science fiction going?

34:03.250 --> 34:06.070
Well, a lot of people ask me that question.

34:07.650 --> 34:10.330
Science fiction is going where it's always been going.

34:12.050 --> 34:17.390
It's going to, I think, become more popular, at least maintain it's popularity.

34:20.410 --> 34:24.530
There will be various...

34:24.530 --> 34:30.950
In some ways it will remain the same in that there will be hardcore science stories.

34:31.770 --> 34:37.450
Stories extrapolate scientific principles.

34:37.990 --> 34:45.810
There will be sociological, sexual, psychological, science fiction and so forth.

34:45.810 --> 34:53.290
And I can't say that it will go in any particular direction if you're talking about change and things.

34:56.580 --> 35:02.090
Right now science fiction covers all the things that are possible.

35:03.750 --> 35:08.150
But there is human imagination that sets us...

35:08.890 --> 35:15.410
We'll be able to develop new variations and also new concepts out of the old things.

35:17.430 --> 35:21.430
Yes, I hope you're not thinking about science fiction movies.

35:21.590 --> 35:25.250
I'm talking about the literature itself, you're right.

35:25.350 --> 35:27.230
Right, yeah, that's what we're talking about too.

35:27.370 --> 35:30.150
But the movies have been taking in the direction...

35:32.270 --> 35:33.470
In the...

35:34.530 --> 35:36.770
Star Wars, if you know what I mean, for instance.

35:39.970 --> 35:43.970
As interest is a lot of people in making science fiction movies.

35:45.530 --> 35:50.110
For the first time really in this field, in the movie making field,

35:50.570 --> 35:54.010
we're getting some people who know what science fiction is all about.

35:55.150 --> 35:57.870
In the past, with a few exceptions,

36:00.150 --> 36:04.650
we've had producers and directors who thought, well, we'll make a science fiction movie.

36:04.970 --> 36:10.330
And they were basing their idea of science fiction strictly on what I would call horror literature.

36:11.490 --> 36:12.390
Monster literature.

36:13.130 --> 36:22.450
Well, now I think there's an indication that we're going to get very good science fiction movies,

36:22.570 --> 36:26.810
which will be based on philosophical, sociological concepts.

36:27.690 --> 36:31.210
I'm not putting Star Wars down because I loved it, I saw it seven times.

36:32.070 --> 36:35.210
And really had a great time with it.

36:35.490 --> 36:41.510
And I'm very grateful that Lucas made it because Lucas was a person who knew science fiction and loved it.

36:42.150 --> 36:47.210
And he made a movie which is strictly out of the 30s and 40s.

36:47.550 --> 36:47.850
Both.

36:48.370 --> 36:49.290
Science fiction both.

36:49.890 --> 36:51.050
It's a magnificent job.

36:52.050 --> 36:57.950
But the success of that is going to encourage other producers not to imitate it,

36:58.750 --> 37:00.050
if I may be fatal,

37:00.750 --> 37:09.670
but to try some of the hundreds and hundreds of good stories that exist in science fiction.

37:10.310 --> 37:19.850
The novel, which will be acceptable by the general audience because they are getting conditioned now to thinking differently.

37:21.050 --> 37:27.550
And they're noticing in the Star Wars they never stop to explain things like space war or that sort of stuff.

37:27.730 --> 37:31.670
They just did it and they found they find out it's not necessary to explain it.

37:33.010 --> 37:39.530
There's a certain parallel to science fiction magazine stories when they first started.

37:40.030 --> 37:43.250
When Hugo Grimsbeck, we had Air Wonder and Science Wonder,

37:45.570 --> 37:47.370
started magazine science fiction.

37:48.830 --> 37:54.450
His authors always felt compelled to stop and explain just what was happening in Greek detail,

37:54.450 --> 37:59.370
thereby slowing the story down and it really wasn't necessary anyway.

38:00.210 --> 38:05.070
Well, movies, I think in the future, are going to accept this concept.

38:07.390 --> 38:15.630
And they're going to take the position that the movie audience is really more intelligent than they've given the credit for before.

38:16.310 --> 38:21.030
And the moviegoers are going to be able to accept these concepts.

38:22.310 --> 38:27.050
And therefore we're going to get much better science fiction movies than they've had in the past.

38:27.550 --> 38:35.870
Also, unfortunately, we're going to get a lot more bad ones because there are a lot of imitators out there.

38:35.970 --> 38:38.330
They say it's something that makes Star Wars interesting.

38:38.810 --> 38:42.490
I think, oh boy, then they make a bad imitation.

38:43.870 --> 38:47.310
But on the other hand, I'm going to get a good one too.

38:49.650 --> 38:51.210
At least that's my idea.

38:52.310 --> 38:56.430
Mr. Farmer, I believe that about does it from Irene.

38:57.270 --> 38:58.490
Yeah, it's been fun for me.
