Put My Little Shoes Away. The day is growing darker mother, and I'm growing very weak.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.156
Let one drop of water mother.

00:16.797 --> 00:24.228
Fall upon... and nevermore shall play.

00:24.248 --> 00:28.755
Give them all my toys mother...

00:29.393 --> 00:37.444
You will...mother. Put the shoes away. ...mother

00:37.464 --> 00:43.773
Put my little shoes away.

00:51.224 --> 00:51.844
Santa Claus brought them to me.

00:51.864 --> 00:55.890
With so many other things...

00:56.157 --> 01:06.477
With a pair of golden wings. Baby soon will be larger.

01:06.597 --> 01:13.310
And ask, don't you listen to me, mother?

01:13.330 --> 01:18.300
As he walks along the street, you, you, don't you, tell it away.

01:18.770 --> 01:26.569
Give them all my toys mother, put my little shoes
