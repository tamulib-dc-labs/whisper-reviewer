00:18.037 --> 00:30.655
I feel like a well-made fire.

00:31.576 --> 00:41.510
If I don't get to buy and buy, then wake me.

00:42.732 --> 00:47.318
Take me, don't let me sleep too late.

00:47.585 --> 00:54.131
For I'm flying away in the night.

00:54.151 --> 00:58.696
Don't bring on the golden gate.

01:00.117 --> 01:02.820
A ship's going to sail down tomorrow.

01:07.565 --> 01:11.288
Get your tickets on the bay.

01:12.189 --> 01:15.212
Don't bring on the golden gate.

01:18.398 --> 01:22.583
Hey, then wake me.

01:23.924 --> 01:24.365
Get me.

01:24.385 --> 01:29.090
Don't let me stick to the lake.

01:29.110 --> 01:36.058
Come fly away in the morning.

01:36.319 --> 01:47.832
Don't play long, too long.

01:50.022 --> 01:54.809
He'll wake me.

01:55.070 --> 01:56.993
He'll wake me.

01:57.013 --> 01:57.453
He'll wake me.

01:58.435 --> 02:04.304
I'll seek to let some guide away in my head.

02:06.066 --> 02:11.895
The king of the golden king.
