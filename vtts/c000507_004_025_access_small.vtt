WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:03.980
I'm going to switch the tape here and check the voice.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.080
What's the weather like out there in California?

00:08.660 --> 00:15.520
Oh, it's just finished raining and now it's blue skies and sunshine and everything's clear

00:15.520 --> 00:18.640
and the mountains have got snow on them which is sort of nice.

00:20.460 --> 00:21.280
All right.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.280
Great, I've got a slight.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.000
Okay, we have the tape rolling on this end.

00:31.220 --> 00:34.420
Okay, I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do with this voice.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.200
Well what I'll do is I'll simply ask questions and then you just answer them.

00:39.140 --> 00:43.740
And if you want to make comments or anything like that, that's exactly what we're here

00:43.740 --> 00:43.980
for.

00:45.480 --> 00:45.880
Okay.

00:47.460 --> 00:49.420
Oh, by the way, I mean stop the machine.

00:49.820 --> 00:51.100
Got the machine going again.

00:54.700 --> 01:00.740
Okay, in the mode in God's eye, your co-author Larry Niven and you were trying to write what

01:00.740 --> 01:03.560
I believe you called the epitome of a first contact novel.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.400
You must have had to develop quite a bit of background information for that, didn't you?

01:08.060 --> 01:14.220
Yeah, we probably have as much material in note for that book as there is in the book.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.480
Not sure what to do with it anymore.

01:18.780 --> 01:21.680
We had several notebooks for the stuff.

01:24.320 --> 01:27.420
Civilizations and histories and the rest of it.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.900
And you know like developing the Modi culture?

01:34.040 --> 01:39.200
Yeah, well we had to come up with a rationale for why are they that way and how did they

01:39.200 --> 01:41.040
get to be that way and so forth.

01:41.040 --> 01:52.480
And that was always started with an asymmetrical alien, which was something that Larry had

01:52.480 --> 01:56.080
left over from a story along that he'd never finished writing.

01:59.200 --> 02:04.300
And I can't work without knowing why things happen.

02:05.840 --> 02:12.540
I've learned a lot more able to believe in six impossible things before breakfast than

02:12.540 --> 02:12.980
I am.

02:13.820 --> 02:17.780
So he can sit there and write a story that he hadn't really believed had happened.

02:18.460 --> 02:19.860
I'm not very good at that.

02:20.620 --> 02:26.980
I generally don't, I can't stay interested in something unless I think it might happen,

02:28.120 --> 02:31.140
which means that I have to work out how it could have happened.

02:31.140 --> 02:35.960
So we ended up getting quite a lot of stuff on the subject of the Modi.

02:37.080 --> 02:42.240
And finally I can see they're a fairly self-consistent set of aliens.

02:42.900 --> 02:49.640
Probably there's no such thing, but their evolution could easily have come about I think.

02:55.980 --> 03:01.600
Why did you and Niven choose to put Modi and Ghazaya in your future history of the codominium?

03:02.140 --> 03:02.820
Oh, I don't know.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.460
We were looking, I didn't believe in his future history.

03:07.900 --> 03:13.680
His known space theory is, in my judgment, holds you to drive a truck through.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.060
I just don't think it can happen.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.020
Neither does he, by the way.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.080
So, which doesn't mean it's not interesting, because it is.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.420
It's interesting and a lot of fun.

03:23.520 --> 03:29.720
But again, I have this problem of not really being able to do a lot of work on things that I don't believe in.

03:32.220 --> 03:38.280
So we built this surround mud that's around the Soanite already had, and it worked out.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.960
How did you put together the codominium?

03:43.160 --> 03:44.320
No, I don't know.

03:44.460 --> 03:48.360
About the same way we're putting it together in the real world, isn't it?

03:48.500 --> 03:53.880
It looks now as if the alliance seems to be the United States and China,

03:54.960 --> 04:00.220
but it could just about as easily given a few changes in the structure of government in Russia.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.120
It'd been the United States and Russia against China, couldn't it?

04:03.640 --> 04:04.360
Yeah, very possibly.

04:04.920 --> 04:10.040
And in fact, that was a very logical way for things to have gone back in the 60s,

04:10.040 --> 04:14.080
when the Chinese were running around trying to tear the world apart, you may remember.

04:14.640 --> 04:14.800
Yes.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.720
They've got reasonable and the Russians didn't, as it happened,

04:20.120 --> 04:22.220
but it could just as easily have gone the other way.

04:24.140 --> 04:28.700
So really, you took and extrapolated our existing political situation.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.140
Yeah, well, I'm not convinced it won't happen yet, of course.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.960
I mean, Russia has got to go out of business one of these days,

04:35.960 --> 04:39.400
and who knows who takes over over there?

04:39.400 --> 04:41.340
They don't know. Why should we know?

04:43.440 --> 04:48.560
I don't suppose there's anybody in the world who knows who's going to be in charge when Brezhnev goes out of business, right?

04:49.060 --> 04:49.280
Right.

04:50.860 --> 04:51.820
Including Brezhnev.

04:54.680 --> 05:02.180
The United States at least has got a certain amount of stability in which you can make a fairly short list of people who are likely to be president.

05:02.940 --> 05:06.480
And the mechanism by which they get there is fairly well known.

05:07.440 --> 05:12.760
The mechanism by which you get to be the unanimous choice of the Russian people to be their fearless leader

05:12.760 --> 05:15.260
is not really known even to the Russians, is it?

05:16.080 --> 05:17.380
Not from what I can tell.

05:17.740 --> 05:25.360
Well, you know, Berea thought he had it set up at one point, and his gun stuck in his pocket quite literally.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.600
They had a shootout at a cabinet meeting, and he lost.

05:32.020 --> 05:43.500
So you take the coefficient or friction of a gun fight against a wool suit, and you follow that in as one of the important variables of human history, right?

05:44.080 --> 05:44.340
Right.

05:44.680 --> 05:51.600
Since if Berea had been in charge, heaven knows what happened. I suspect the codominium would have come about if Berea had taken over instead of Khrushchev.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.800
He was just a cynical power broker. I doubt that he believed in very much of anything.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.520
You have a background in political science, don't you?

06:06.140 --> 06:07.920
Well, among others.

06:09.020 --> 06:09.220
Yeah.

06:12.960 --> 06:19.980
I've noticed in your work you do have, you base some of your story around the political intrigue that goes on.

06:25.340 --> 06:29.240
Yeah, I'm not sure I understand why that calls for comment.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.600
No, I was just making a comment.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.440
Back to a better question.

06:38.420 --> 06:43.540
How did the mechanics of collaborating with another author like Niven work?

06:43.540 --> 06:49.900
Well, we get asked that so often that I don't really feel much like talking about it anymore.

06:50.100 --> 06:54.920
We've gone through this 150 times, at every convention, everywhere else.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.820
The best thing I can say is we just do it, you know?

06:57.080 --> 06:57.900
Okay, how about a note?

06:57.920 --> 07:02.920
You sit down and you write the book, and some people work together and some can't.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.760
Okay. How about getting some background information on you then?

07:06.920 --> 07:07.120
Okay.

07:07.120 --> 07:13.220
Yeah, well, I used to write books before I took up saving the space program for a living.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.520
It seems to be what I'm doing lately is I'm sitting here with this telephone glued in my ear.

07:18.560 --> 07:23.280
Just before you called, I said I've been on a phone in Washington for two hours.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.300
Yesterday all day.

07:26.280 --> 07:32.640
We're running around trying to rebuild the space program and still live within the budget cuts.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.460
It's not easy to do.

07:35.360 --> 07:46.580
I'm a chairman of a citizen's advisory group that's working on plans for the administration,

07:47.060 --> 07:51.680
but we don't, that doesn't mean you can guarantee that they're going to take care of it.

07:53.520 --> 08:00.160
We have a problem right now in that the administration wants to chop back the budget,

08:00.160 --> 08:03.780
which you can certainly, they've got to do.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.860
The country cannot go on like this.

08:06.100 --> 08:11.980
At the same time, if we don't keep up some investments in high technology,

08:11.980 --> 08:13.780
we're not going to have anything to live off of.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.960
You've got to invest something once in a while, you know?

08:17.260 --> 08:29.600
And unfortunately, the structure of the government and the tax situation and the rest of it is such that you are not going to get private investment in things as inherently risky as space technology.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.640
Because they don't let you keep into the profits.

08:33.840 --> 08:38.900
Profits are nasty word nowadays, so who wants to risk everything on something that you can't win on?

08:39.020 --> 08:43.460
So you're going to have to have government research until they change some of the laws I'm going to do with the tax structure.

08:44.880 --> 08:50.220
And if we don't do that, then I guess we'll sit here and become, we're already an underdeveloped nation.

08:50.540 --> 08:55.520
And if our major export is agriculture, we're beginning to import high technology.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.720
We're buying airplanes from overseas now.

08:57.720 --> 08:58.560
Can you imagine that?

08:59.720 --> 09:03.460
Eastern Airlines is now flying a thing called the Airbus, which is made in Europe.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.820
American domestic airlines are flying foreign airplanes.

09:09.180 --> 09:13.420
We're importing computers, and we're going to be doing more of that pretty soon.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.300
We're underdeveloped countries.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.980
We don't start doing some investment, we're going to stay that way.

09:22.720 --> 09:31.380
So that's what I have been doing for the last couple of weeks, and which is why I don't have my lot of thoughts on the subject of science fiction.

09:31.520 --> 09:46.440
Because I'm still sitting here in the eye of a storm trying to balance about 35 different balls in the air and get a rational program for high technology investments that's it.

09:47.160 --> 09:51.300
You talked about a lot of those same things in your book a step further out, didn't you?

09:51.700 --> 10:02.460
Yeah, right. That's one reason why I seem to be involved in doing some of these things and being in charge of a, not in charge of, but sort of ringmaster tour.

10:03.380 --> 10:12.960
To a fairly large group of scientists and engineers is because of that book, attracted a certain amount of attention.

10:14.160 --> 10:23.220
Yeah, in that book you state that our, I guess, destiny is mankind is linked to our expanding ourselves into space.

10:24.500 --> 10:34.580
Yeah, well, there's that in a step further out, and I've said in other columns and other places, how long is the future?

10:35.860 --> 10:42.680
We presented this, Bassoni and I presented this in a paper to an annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

10:43.480 --> 10:48.880
We think of it as a reasonably important philosophical question. How long is the future?

10:51.280 --> 11:04.280
If it's the way matters and the forester and the limits to growth people think, it's only a couple of hundred years, then there is no point in worrying about it and we might as well eat, drink and be merry, right?

11:05.100 --> 11:22.980
But if on the other hand the future is another a billion generations, a hundred billion years, then we are not the same species as an outfit that's going to live another 200 years, are we?

11:24.280 --> 11:37.360
And if mankind's future is too is a hundred billion years and there's no reason why it should not be a hundred billion years, then we're going to have to outlive the Earth and indeed outlive the Sun and the Solar System.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.880
We may even have to outlive this galaxy.

11:41.360 --> 11:47.880
Now there's nothing in principle that keeps us from doing that. I know of nothing that could stop us other than ourselves.

11:49.980 --> 11:55.360
I've said this a lot of times, but I don't know how you can't say it too often.

11:55.680 --> 12:08.260
One of the most ironic things that ever happened was that just after we went to the moon, they held in Stockholm a conference whose theme title was Only One Earth.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.840
And that's insane. We don't live on only one Earth.

12:12.840 --> 12:22.120
We live if we want to in a system that's got nine planets and I used to say 38 moons, but now I think it's up to about 50.

12:23.740 --> 12:27.020
And a million asteroids and a million comets.

12:28.440 --> 12:40.420
That's a lot of resources out there, plus an enormous thermonuclear generator, which the Environmental Protection Association would never let you activate that thermonuclear generator out there as far too dangerous.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.300
We call it the Sun.

12:44.560 --> 12:57.300
But if we're going to have a hundred billion years future, we've got to get off this ball and we better do it pretty quick because it's fairly obvious that if we stay cooked up here on it long enough, we're going to do something to ourselves that'll keep us from going out there.

12:58.780 --> 13:10.840
So runs for some of us like me seem to get a little shrill about it sometimes. It's a feeling of urgency here because right now we have the resources. Who knows how long we'll have them?

13:12.840 --> 13:18.260
Yeah, I was wondering, is there some sort of timetable that we're sort of set into in getting into space?

13:19.660 --> 13:23.080
Well, I don't know what you mean by timetable set into. Who would set it?

13:23.360 --> 13:32.040
Well, are there any sort of resources, restrictions that would allow us to get into space now, but maybe not later on?

13:33.340 --> 13:41.300
Pure population pressures. If you believe in the limits to growth model, we don't have very many more generations as well.

13:43.120 --> 13:53.620
If you believe those models, you're going to have tremendous pressures to widely distribute the capital.

13:54.300 --> 14:04.180
Right? At the moment, Western civilization is a fairly wealthy island in the middle of a pretty large sea of poverty.

14:05.700 --> 14:14.200
There are enormous pressures to sort of redistribute the wealth and if you do, then everybody is more or less miserable. There will be very little wealth.

14:14.600 --> 14:21.260
Now, it's unlikely we're going to actually do that because very few people really pop rise themselves voluntarily.

14:22.420 --> 14:30.480
But on the other hand, that's a pretty ripe situation for breeding wars. Bringing back the codominium, by the way.

14:31.100 --> 14:41.280
My suspicion is that the United States and the Soviet Union would rather ally to keep the so-called third world countries from impoverishing them than they would.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.500
You see what I'm getting at.

14:44.380 --> 14:56.640
Genuine foreign aid is, the United States has a fairly good record of generosity on that, but it is still fairly small compared to our national budget.

14:56.640 --> 15:08.420
We do not give until it hurts much, nor are we likely to, nor do I think we should, because if we impoverish ourselves, no one will have the resources to go to space.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.060
It's a very expensive proposition going to space, right?

15:11.580 --> 15:11.840
Right.

15:12.340 --> 15:24.480
It takes a peculiar combination of extra wealth, educated people, high talent, machine shops and resources, and the determination by somebody to do it.

15:24.480 --> 15:31.300
All of those things have to come together at the same time, and that just seems sufficiently fragile to me.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.940
In fact, the whole civilization seems fairly fragile to me.

15:36.000 --> 15:53.080
Roberto Vaca wrote a pretty good book called The Cutting Dark Age, in which he discusses a number of fairly catastrophic scenarios, starting with, well, I don't know, widespread power failures.

15:55.080 --> 16:04.400
In which Western civilization just essentially sort of collapses back into a level approximating the, I don't know, 1900 to 1920 era.

16:05.420 --> 16:10.380
Everybody's reasonably well off, but nobody's got a lot, and there certainly isn't enough to go to space.

16:12.460 --> 16:19.720
A lot of autonomously small communities living off the land counters and so forth, and it considerably decreases in population.

16:20.380 --> 16:35.880
As he says, it's going off and living in a country in small towns without modern convenience and everything is the sort of thing people do now for fun, but it's not very amusing as a way of life, but it may well be the way of life.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.140
You can easily see this kind of thing.

16:39.360 --> 16:44.920
Larry and I wrote a book called Lucifer's Hammer about a natural disaster that can bring about much the same kind of result.

16:46.940 --> 17:05.760
I'm sure that's a rare one, I doubt to you that the world's going to be whammed with a comet, but on the other hand, Alvarez at Berkeley, the business is a Nobel Prize, the business with Berkeley has just come up with a fairly convincing proof that that's what happened to the dinosaur about 100 million years ago,

17:05.840 --> 17:09.740
is that the earth really did get whammed with something big, and it killed them all off.

17:10.960 --> 17:20.560
And furthermore, he seems to have demonstrated that it happens about every 100 million years, and to last what happened 100 million years ago, which doesn't mean it's going to happen this year.

17:22.040 --> 17:29.740
But I can think of a lot of things, wars to just general disorganization.

17:30.700 --> 17:34.740
We keep building bureaucratic structure until we can't support the weight of it any longer.

17:35.480 --> 17:41.020
That would use up all the resources that might take us to space, and if they're gone, how do you get there?

17:46.680 --> 17:48.960
The interesting thing, I mean, space is expensive.

17:49.460 --> 17:53.960
Each Apollo shot cost almost 15 days supply of cigarettes.

17:56.520 --> 18:01.440
The amount of money that was spent on an Apollo would have kept the United States in liquor for a whole week.

18:04.140 --> 18:04.980
It's expensive.

18:08.980 --> 18:13.560
It's not very expensive compared to a lot of things we do, but it's still expensive.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.960
Yes, sir. Okay, I was making sure that you were finished.

18:23.480 --> 18:29.260
I liked your gentle, somewhat gentle sarcasm there about the liquor and the cigarettes. That was nice.

18:33.680 --> 18:47.280
Even though there are some restrictions on us, you've talked about in your articles that we can survive, and if I might quote you, we can survive with style.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.820
How might that be brought about?

18:52.020 --> 18:55.180
Well, that can give you some alternate scenarios.

18:55.620 --> 19:07.280
But we are trying to convince the President and the administration of them for essentially the same amount of money we're spending on the space program now.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.440
Redirected slightly, and with a little added to it, it doesn't take much.

19:13.440 --> 19:28.360
To give you the following scenario, we could have by 1988 a space industrial park, which is essentially a housekeeping satellite that has industrial facilities and power and oxygen.

19:30.260 --> 19:37.160
And which private companies could go up and put their own modules on to it to make things.

19:37.960 --> 19:41.340
And I give you some ideas of things you can make in space you can't make.

19:41.460 --> 19:50.680
The use of ethical drug processes are enormous in space, and some drugs like uriconase are worth a million dollars a kilogram.

19:52.220 --> 20:00.020
Now, you can make those in fairly large quantities in space because you get perfect mixing and you get good temperature control.

20:00.020 --> 20:09.720
And there are all kinds of reasons why space turns out to be a good place to do certain very high value intrinsically low-yield chemical processes.

20:10.640 --> 20:15.680
You can get deals that are thousands of times better than they are on Earth.

20:17.420 --> 20:23.040
Turbine blades, magnets, people talk about ball bearings.

20:23.240 --> 20:28.580
It's not so clear that you can actually profitably manufacture ball bearings in space because you can make them on Earth.

20:28.580 --> 20:48.080
Now, we don't have to play foam steels, ways of making steel beams that are shot through with air bubbles in such a way that you or I could pick one of them up, or things 10 feet long by put that we could carry around with you, but it's just about as strong as if it were solid.

20:48.780 --> 20:49.940
So that sort of thing.

20:50.860 --> 20:52.420
Very long, complex.

20:52.420 --> 21:06.000
There are a lot of products that we are fairly certain would be profitable, but fairly certain is not good enough that anybody's going to risk going to all the expense of doing that by themselves.

21:06.340 --> 21:20.100
But if you've got already the facility so that you're only having to spend, the private company's only having to spend the marginal cost of this, of adding their own module onto it and paying some rent to the government of the landlord.

21:21.400 --> 21:26.720
Then it becomes a much more attractive proposition, particularly if you give them some decent tax breaks.

21:27.080 --> 21:36.840
Now this can all be in place by 1988, but a year 2000 we can be manufacturing things in space from materials taken from mines on the move.

21:38.480 --> 21:44.760
And all this at a level of US expenditure that is not large compared to what we're doing now.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.140
It's in the order of maybe 10 or 12 billion a year.

21:49.780 --> 21:50.960
Small potatoes.

21:51.820 --> 22:02.600
Not in the United States spent like 5% of its national budget over a period of 10 years on the Panama Canal.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.440
And I think everybody believes that was a good thing to do.

22:07.220 --> 22:08.520
We did well by doing good.

22:09.060 --> 22:11.360
We don't have to spend anything like that.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.780
It's 2.5% of our national budget.

22:14.760 --> 22:19.060
On space over the next 20 years could probably make the whole world rich.

22:19.340 --> 22:22.320
Certainly could keep us fabulously wealthy.

22:23.880 --> 22:38.160
Because the, you were talking about when you begin to manufacture things using power from space and materials from the moon, you're talking about actual new wealth.

22:39.420 --> 22:42.560
Something that has never existed on this planet before.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.900
You're actually bringing wealth to this planet.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.920
And that's quite a thing.

22:50.340 --> 22:51.820
This is all very possible.

22:52.400 --> 22:56.920
I mean it's not dreams, it's not fantasies, there's nothing ridiculous about it.

22:58.140 --> 23:02.420
You have permanent moon base by the year 2000, you begin to get lunar colonies.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.880
I suspect that people would choose to live there.

23:05.140 --> 23:07.200
Some will, some won't, some will.

23:07.200 --> 23:16.020
I'm sure I could find 500 highly qualified families that would be willing to move to the moon tomorrow.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.560
No one would never come back.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.400
They're very qualified people.

23:20.340 --> 23:22.780
In fact, I think very seriously about doing it myself.

23:23.600 --> 23:28.880
It's a new frontier and there are always people who like frontier atmospheres.

23:30.500 --> 23:34.140
From there, the takeoff is clear.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.420
There's no going back from that.

23:38.480 --> 23:42.000
And we are then insured that there is no single disaster.

23:42.260 --> 23:43.800
They wipe out the whole human race.

23:44.740 --> 23:50.420
It's taken a pretty good step towards our fulfilling our national...

23:52.080 --> 23:54.140
destiny as a human race.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.520
A building our 100 billion year future.

23:58.820 --> 24:05.200
And I would think that doing something like that would be attractive to the president.

24:05.200 --> 24:12.380
And I suspect that my suspicion is that the statesman who put us in the space permanently

24:13.440 --> 24:20.320
would be remembered a lot longer than Isabella the Great and Prince Henry the Navigator.

24:20.860 --> 24:25.820
I mean, would literally be remembered through billions of years of human history.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.760
The man who put us permanently into space.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.640
Along with John Kennedy.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.140
And this is a...

24:34.140 --> 24:39.340
seemed to me like a fairly attractive proposition for some statesman.

24:42.180 --> 24:46.020
And it does not seem to me like an unpopular idea with the public.

24:46.180 --> 24:51.640
Look at the sales of what the Star Wars is still the biggest money maker of all time.

24:52.460 --> 24:52.840
Movie?

24:53.700 --> 24:59.600
Star Trek is still on in syndication 12, 14 years after the...

24:59.600 --> 25:00.580
It is ridiculous.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.480
There's no such thing as science fiction books.

25:03.680 --> 25:10.320
I've got books in print that have been going around for 10, 12 years and I'm a relative newcomer to the field.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.820
There are some science fiction books in print that are 30 years old.

25:14.320 --> 25:18.560
Now, who won the Pulitzer Prize for literature 12 years ago?

25:19.540 --> 25:20.940
I bet it's books not in print.

25:24.220 --> 25:27.980
You're not talking about something that's unpopular with the people of this country, I think.

25:27.980 --> 25:29.440
High technology is very popular.

25:30.260 --> 25:34.080
And look, you took a look at the sales of science magazines now.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.640
Where you turn around is a new science magazine.

25:39.080 --> 25:46.560
It would seem to me that here is a marvelous opportunity for somebody to go out and do well by doing good.

25:46.980 --> 25:53.240
Become one of the most famous people in history by doing something that is politically very popular.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.680
God knows it didn't hurt John Kennedy any.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.300
Yeah, well, I definitely hope you're right.

26:08.380 --> 26:15.900
You've speculated about several different types of, I guess you would call launching systems for rockets.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.180
And one of them is the laser launch system.

26:19.860 --> 26:23.720
I believe you wrote the first story that concerned itself with that.

26:23.960 --> 26:24.700
That's probably true.

26:25.160 --> 26:25.260
Yeah.

26:25.980 --> 26:27.560
Where did that idea come from?

26:28.360 --> 26:28.920
Where was it developed?

26:29.120 --> 26:36.620
It was called Cantruits, who's by the way, Dutch Cantruits is on the board of the Alphabets Society.

26:37.780 --> 26:41.540
Along with people like Martin Minsky and Robert Heinlein.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.760
I strongly recommend the Alphabets Society to people, by the way.

26:48.160 --> 26:55.520
I think Cantruits first came up with that idea at Avco Everett a couple of years ago.

26:55.720 --> 27:03.700
And in a film I have two engineers, one of them named Perry, and I don't remember the other one I saw to say.

27:06.380 --> 27:14.380
Did some development work on the concept and have actually flown some little models using lasers and power sources.

27:14.380 --> 27:22.260
The laser sits on the ground. It's something like it was only much larger, was described in Motengard's asks.

27:23.980 --> 27:29.820
It looks like a perfectly reasonable system. It certainly would work on the moon.

27:31.720 --> 27:36.360
Using, you'd have to ablate materials out of the rocket chamber.

27:36.740 --> 27:42.420
It looks like it ought to work on the earth. There's nothing, say, scale models that work, dollar theory works.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.020
Again, it's expensive to start with.

27:47.340 --> 27:52.460
There are a lot of ways of getting the space other than disintegrating totem poles.

27:55.540 --> 27:58.900
But you have to first decide that you want to go there.

27:59.680 --> 28:08.480
And one of the things that we, the Alphabets Society, Citizens Advisory Council, and the other things that are trying to convince the administration,

28:09.780 --> 28:22.900
is that really the business of NASA should be to develop these new technologies, rather than doing spectacular missions.

28:23.040 --> 28:27.680
Missions are fine, but we need right now some building blocks and technology.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.080
And of course you need some missions to keep people interested in the program.

28:31.780 --> 28:34.060
But technology should be more important than missions.

28:34.060 --> 28:41.160
And there are a lot of technologies that ought to be being investigated and which really are not being looked at very strongly now,

28:41.160 --> 28:43.200
because it's in nobody's interest to look at them.

28:44.820 --> 28:52.140
You can't get rich off of them because you're talking about things that won't happen for, if everything goes well,

28:52.280 --> 28:54.880
you can't start making money at them for 10 or 15 years.

28:55.200 --> 29:01.220
And there are a few stockholders who invest in things for a 10 or 15-year-old, a year, pay off.

29:01.220 --> 29:07.560
There used to be, there used to be, as Milton Friedman and his son David Friedman,

29:07.740 --> 29:12.620
as a friend of mine, we've had this argument many times, he thinks the government should get the heck out of everything.

29:13.980 --> 29:22.200
And as David points out, that in the last century there were a lot of investments that were not expected to mature for 10 or 15, 20 years.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.260
But nowadays people don't have much confidence in the future, so they don't.

29:25.260 --> 29:31.480
And you go to the Harvard School of Business or the Wharton School of Finance or some of these famous management schools,

29:31.680 --> 29:38.480
they teach you management techniques that really eventually, with your looking at not only the annual report, but the quarterly report, you know.

29:40.280 --> 29:48.180
And as a consequence, it's hard to find anybody who's interested in investing in something for the next generation,

29:48.480 --> 29:51.060
which means it's practically got to be done by the government.

29:52.600 --> 29:57.000
And that used to be, I thought, the definition of statesmanship anyway, wasn't it?

29:57.000 --> 30:00.440
The politician looks at the next election, the statesman looks at the next generation.

30:02.020 --> 30:12.240
Probably the biggest defect of democracy is that we don't have any institutionalized mechanisms for looking after our grandchildren's welfare.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.640
And that meant our kids.

30:16.380 --> 30:19.500
Aristocracies do, monarchies do, because it visibly is there.

30:19.700 --> 30:25.720
You're now in a king sitting there and he's looking at this kid running around the palace and thinking, well, that boy's going to have his job on these days.

30:26.040 --> 30:31.020
And if I do certain things, it's going to make it very tough on him, so I better do something else so that it won't be so hard on him.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.640
But we haven't got anybody who thinks that way in the end of democracy.

30:34.880 --> 30:39.280
And it just seems to me somebody had better start looking out for the future or they ain't going to be one.

30:42.100 --> 30:47.140
Are the, by the time that they do it all might be too late to do anything about it?

30:47.760 --> 30:52.340
Well, that's the scary thing of course, is how long will we have this fabulous wealth.

30:52.460 --> 30:55.060
Right now we have resources all over the place.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.940
It just, you know, we can afford it easily.

30:57.600 --> 31:09.260
I'm not kidding when I say that for, you know, let me raise the liquor tax by 50% and put all of our money in the bank.

31:09.280 --> 31:16.260
And I can go right into the space program and I can make the country so bloom and rich that you can probably do away with taxes in another generation.

31:18.160 --> 31:24.560
That's the ridiculous part about it, is that you're talking about sources of new wealth that never happened before.

31:26.520 --> 31:35.200
The nearest analogy I can think of is Alaska, where they're setting on so much oil they're abolishing all of state taxes and now they're trying to figure out what else to do with the money, you know?

31:36.260 --> 31:40.440
They don't need to worry about it, the federal government will figure out some way to take it away from us.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.380
And they'll spend it for nothing and throw it away.

31:44.780 --> 31:46.660
They will never invest anything anymore.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.240
It's terrifying.

31:50.880 --> 31:56.520
But you're setting on what amounts to a gold mine, it's a moon out there, it's a whole planet of resources.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.300
You know, the space is raining soup.

32:00.980 --> 32:04.940
It's just a matter of going out and doing a little development and picking up some soup bowls.

32:05.260 --> 32:09.220
But it is not, it's not fast return on investment.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.760
It's not something I can put my money in now and go cash out a year from now.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.020
It's not my, I put it in and my kids will come out well.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.880
But somewhere shouldn't we be doing some of that?

32:21.880 --> 32:25.180
It took 15 years to build a Panama Canal, wasn't it worth doing?

32:25.180 --> 32:25.280
We?

32:29.700 --> 32:32.200
Very good point. Could you hold for just a second please?

32:32.540 --> 32:34.600
Well, yeah, we're gonna wrap this up pretty quick.

32:34.800 --> 32:35.100
Yes, sir.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.260
Back with you, sir.

32:58.100 --> 32:58.580
Okay.

32:59.800 --> 33:04.160
Yeah, let's get in a little bit to King David's spaceship.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.740
And then we can go ahead and wrap it up here.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.200
All right, are you ready?

33:14.540 --> 33:15.280
All right.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.980
You seem to have an interest in medieval cultures.

33:18.340 --> 33:21.320
You used them in the Janissaries and in King David's spaceship.

33:21.820 --> 33:23.580
Where did you get the interest in medieval cultures?

33:23.580 --> 33:30.060
Well, I did a lot of work in history getting my doctorate in clinical science.

33:31.140 --> 33:34.360
I've always been sort of interested in these things.

33:34.780 --> 33:40.480
My friend, Paul Anderson, once called me a 14th century liberal.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.980
Because I have some interest I've had in the high Middle Ages.

33:47.040 --> 33:52.820
Those were times when people felt more integrated into their culture.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.100
Loyalties were not.

33:55.800 --> 33:56.840
What was it in the song?

33:57.120 --> 34:00.140
In the King Charlie Golden Days when loyalty no harm meant.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.320
They're nice things to write about.

34:04.500 --> 34:14.020
And I think I see some signs of a kind of return to feudal institutions.

34:14.020 --> 34:16.980
We've built a number of them in this country.

34:17.080 --> 34:21.620
They're not normally recognized as feudal institutions, but a labor union certainly is as an example.

34:24.180 --> 34:29.580
Certain structures of corporate loyalty and associations of that kind.

34:29.800 --> 34:36.240
Things that institutions and in many cases people that stand between you and an all powerful government.

34:37.120 --> 34:40.400
It's a lot easier to be loyal to things like that.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.440
A lot of our problems we've had in this country.

34:44.740 --> 34:54.440
Tended to cut all of the ties of loyalty between citizens so that you end up with the only thing that you're supposed to have the loyalty to.

34:54.660 --> 35:01.140
This nebulous national government in Washington which acts in such a contemptible manner quite often.

35:01.220 --> 35:04.980
That it's pretty hard for you to work up integrated enthusiasm for them.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.920
That's part of it.

35:08.920 --> 35:14.120
That part of it has always fascinated me a little bit as to the conflict of cultures.

35:14.840 --> 35:22.040
What happens if you take somebody with modern ideas and throw them into a situation with many different types of structures.

35:23.900 --> 35:25.250
That's mostly it.

35:28.110 --> 35:28.770
Yes.

35:29.710 --> 35:36.670
In your writing in King David's spaceship and also I guess in the codominium future history.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.670
They're all set in the same future history then.

35:42.510 --> 35:46.050
You chose empires as the type of government that would prevail.

35:46.830 --> 35:47.510
Why is that so?

35:47.510 --> 36:00.670
Well, empires seem to me to be the most normal form of human government in the sense that it is almost certainly the until this century was the most common one.

36:01.930 --> 36:12.170
Nationalistic kingdoms or nationalistic tribal government of one kind or another in which the loyalties are basically true people like me.

36:13.690 --> 36:18.790
They tend to be pretty brutal things if you're one of the outsiders.

36:20.130 --> 36:30.930
It seems to me that one of the most brilliant inventions of mankind in which we have had for a long time its origins are really kind of lost in antiquity.

36:31.350 --> 36:33.290
We have some legends about them.

36:36.890 --> 36:46.390
The development of a mechanism by which people can actually have loyalties that cut across tribal and some of your clan type of grounds.

36:48.370 --> 36:53.490
Now, democracies theoretically have that but in practice they don't seem to generate it very much.

36:53.730 --> 36:57.970
They sometimes do but they're fairly unstable.

36:59.310 --> 37:00.590
At least they have been.

37:00.730 --> 37:03.490
Wealthy republics have historically not lasted very long.

37:03.610 --> 37:13.610
We've just about got the record and there's some doubt about us and whether we'll remain a republic or remain wealthy.

37:15.070 --> 37:27.790
Now, you can make a case for saying the characteristic form of human government is the empire and the characteristic size of an empire is that it grows until it runs up against another one.

37:29.110 --> 37:37.570
Now, you may case against that too but if you look at human history that certainly is a proposition that is defensible.

37:39.030 --> 37:40.130
That's point one.

37:42.030 --> 37:48.190
Secondly, it's very hard to see how you can have an interstellar civilization that isn't something like that.

37:49.910 --> 37:53.070
You might have a council or something.

37:53.330 --> 38:01.370
You've got to have however something at the center which has a fairly automatic means of succession to get from there.

38:01.850 --> 38:07.890
Because you're not going to have elections spread out over star systems that are separated by years of travel time.

38:09.210 --> 38:14.910
And again, you look back and well, have we ever had any governments that were that way?

38:15.170 --> 38:19.150
And yes, we have and in every case they tended to the imperial form.

38:19.990 --> 38:34.590
You had the Roman system and you had the British system of the last century and the British one deliberately went from a monarchical tribal kind of government.

38:36.350 --> 38:46.870
Victoria of England to a frank model of the late days of the Roman Republic or the early days of the Roman Empire.

38:47.030 --> 38:49.010
I mean it was deliberately modeled after it even.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.710
The queen becoming the queen emperor and so forth.

38:56.470 --> 38:59.070
I don't know of any other systems that have done this.

38:59.070 --> 39:06.590
I mean there's been duels for any great length of time and which were spread across many cultures and vast distances and so forth.

39:07.630 --> 39:18.910
So that you could almost say that what I have put in those books is a very conservative projection of what life could be like.

39:18.910 --> 39:30.870
I understand that it's a fairly radical looking one to people who have been brought up as American kids are brought up with almost no sense of history.

39:31.830 --> 39:36.810
And in fact almost a religious avoidance of the subject of history.

39:38.830 --> 39:43.510
But given much exposure to things historical.

39:43.510 --> 39:48.170
So I think the question would have been the other way around.

39:48.890 --> 39:59.730
You would wonder you would you would ask what else you could have put there if you would try to have a civilization that spanned many stars communications were long in time.

40:00.470 --> 40:01.190
If you see what it is.

40:02.090 --> 40:02.590
Yes I do.

40:03.370 --> 40:09.470
Now a different kind of culture would with eventually I don't suspect if you had instantaneous communication.

40:09.470 --> 40:15.830
But I very carefully excluded that possibility as indeed the universe seems to exclude that possibility.

40:20.810 --> 40:21.450
OK.

40:22.110 --> 40:27.730
Yeah that would with instantaneous communications that would obviously make other other forms possible.

40:29.130 --> 40:31.230
Maybe not likely but it'd make them possible.

40:32.200 --> 40:42.030
You may argue of course that that that the difficulties of holding disparate groups together are sufficiently.

40:43.210 --> 40:55.030
There that that it won't happen and that you'll have maybe a solar system or even a planet or is the natural size of a political unit and there won't be any real.

40:56.610 --> 40:59.650
You know that and then nothing larger than that will exist.

41:01.050 --> 41:04.150
To which I can only say that that's quite possibly the case.

41:04.250 --> 41:13.350
But at the same time if you've got if something else came into being it would then have almost no competition with it.

41:13.350 --> 41:14.070
You see what I mean.

41:14.570 --> 41:23.650
If something did evolve a mechanism that could be bigger than that that it would almost automatically grow until it had encompassed everything around it.

41:23.650 --> 41:29.650
And that in fact is the history of the total and then the empire grew from it.

41:33.530 --> 41:40.490
To some extent political units grow dependent in large amount upon.

41:43.450 --> 41:51.890
Or take a gase put it very nicely in the in the in the results of the masses when he said in the last analysis political authority rests upon the shoulders of the junior officers.

41:54.530 --> 42:01.450
If you if you got the lieutenants and captains on your side you can pretty well dang near do anything you want.

42:01.950 --> 42:03.650
And if you don't you can't.

42:05.550 --> 42:09.910
Because they're the ones that the troops usually obey the troops don't really care that much about the general.

42:10.530 --> 42:15.650
But they'll usually follow that their own sergeants and their sergeants will usually follow their own officers.

42:16.970 --> 42:29.430
Well if that's the case you're talking about a fairly restricted group which is that there's a young people typically at least up until now at least young men in fact at the ages of 18 to 25.

42:31.270 --> 42:46.110
And that psychology is fairly easily known and the mechanisms by which you get them to be loyal to people and institutions and so forth has been studied over the course of the long course of history.

42:47.890 --> 42:56.530
You know in courses that they now teach called military psychology and leadership which they used to teach they don't teach that anymore nowadays.

42:57.190 --> 43:05.230
Modern army all these guys are supposed to be technicians and nobody seems to know anything about leading troops which is a dreadful mistake.

43:07.410 --> 43:20.560
So they're all pinned towards personal loyalties and once again historically royal families tend to if they have acted in a fairly intelligent way tend to be able to build fairly strong loyalties.

43:23.670 --> 43:24.490
Yeah.

43:24.490 --> 43:30.550
By the way I say typically male because I think women are too smart to be fooled by a lot of the tricks that have been developed by men.

43:31.390 --> 43:41.730
You know you get women to fight for their houses but to go off and get killed for a banner or a flag and a song is easy to talk young men into that and then talk young ladies into it.

43:45.850 --> 43:47.370
I think you're correct.

43:48.530 --> 43:51.390
They're smart enough you know in many ways.

43:52.870 --> 44:17.630
And if you want to go into sociobiology on it it would be enormously surprising to me to discover that that five million years of pre-civilization old history has produced such disparate character traits in all the other between the sections of all the other mammalian species except us.

44:19.050 --> 44:20.210
No one is right.

44:20.330 --> 44:27.310
Mine would suppose that Tom Katz has the same temperament as Tabby Katz right.

44:27.770 --> 44:28.710
I mean nobody believes that.

44:28.790 --> 44:29.470
Everybody knows better.

44:30.070 --> 44:39.230
Nobody believes that male dogs and female dogs have the same temperament or is equally trainable or anything else.

44:40.870 --> 44:44.250
But we are supposed nowadays to believe that of a human being.

44:44.650 --> 44:46.650
Well maybe but I would.

44:46.650 --> 44:50.230
You know that's a surprising fact if we if true.

44:53.070 --> 44:58.970
Temperamentally I think they are the same when they are not of any other mammalian group that I know.

45:01.370 --> 45:03.050
I just have one more question sir.

45:04.830 --> 45:07.050
If I let me shut the machine down for a second.
