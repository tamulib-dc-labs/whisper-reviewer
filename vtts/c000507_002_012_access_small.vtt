00:01.880 --> 00:08.060
To science fiction lovers, if there are any mathematicians in the crowd who are purest

00:08.060 --> 00:13.500
in the way the word infinity is used, I apologize in advance, but I warn you, if you get too

00:13.500 --> 00:14.900
rough on me, I'll fight back.

00:17.520 --> 00:23.400
My claim is that science fiction is an infinite activity, but there is no end to it.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.260
It can go on forever and ever.

00:25.260 --> 00:31.720
For our men, people can keep writing new stories, working out new ways of having fun with the

00:31.720 --> 00:38.140
business, painting new pictures, I don't care how, making up more movies, plays, television

00:38.140 --> 00:39.640
things, there is no limit.

00:40.060 --> 00:42.080
This is my opinion for what it's worth.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.200
I'm going to spend the rest of the yak in trying to defend it.

00:47.580 --> 00:51.880
To do so, I'll have to stretch things perhaps a little bit.

00:52.580 --> 00:59.280
I'll have to include in science fiction stuff that isn't pure, correct, hard, solid science

00:59.280 --> 01:01.000
fiction such as I always write.

01:01.660 --> 01:06.700
I'll have to let in occasional things which even have errors in them, horrid thought.

01:07.440 --> 01:15.280
Like the notion that a planet which spins rapidly enough could have an elliptical cross-section

01:15.280 --> 01:18.840
and have three G's at the equator and six hundred at the poles, you know.

01:20.240 --> 01:26.480
Since it became easy to steal computer time, lots of people have checked up on me on that one

01:26.480 --> 01:29.320
and apparently Mestlin would have come to a point at the edge.

01:29.720 --> 01:30.700
Don't blame me.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.340
I couldn't get hold of a computer in 1952.

01:35.660 --> 01:43.400
So the errors will have to come in and they will ease very gradually over the edge into

01:43.400 --> 01:45.720
what is frankly fantasy.

01:46.160 --> 01:51.820
I don't really care where the line is drawn, but as long as we put this stuff all together,

01:51.900 --> 01:54.200
I still think there's no end to it.

01:54.940 --> 02:02.160
Now the mistakes cropped up even way back in the beginning in the days of Jude Fern when I was young.

02:03.820 --> 02:11.280
And the first of the slides represents an interesting story which all of you have read,

02:11.280 --> 02:13.180
but not this version of it.

02:13.920 --> 02:22.340
It seems there was a hero who had a scientist friend and a girlfriend who in this particular

02:22.340 --> 02:26.980
version was not the scientist's daughter and he had a very wicked enemy.

02:28.140 --> 02:35.280
And the enemy came bouncing around to kill him and fired a bullet and the young lady

02:35.280 --> 02:39.880
heroically thrust herself in the way and what with one thing and another,

02:39.880 --> 02:42.260
there was a bullet lodged beside her spine.

02:42.920 --> 02:49.020
And it just happened that the hero had recently invented a device for reducing human beings

02:49.020 --> 02:51.520
and other things to extremely small size.

02:52.340 --> 02:57.240
And this was published when Isaac Asimov was 14 years old.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.140
He didn't write it.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.920
It is called A World Unseen.

03:01.260 --> 03:03.660
It was written by Joseph William Skidmore.

03:03.660 --> 03:12.440
It appeared in one of the stories in I think the February and April issues of 1934,

03:12.700 --> 03:13.940
but I could be a bit out.

03:14.060 --> 03:17.220
There's another first fandom type over there who can always check me up.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.500
That's close.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.700
My memory is perfect.

03:20.180 --> 03:21.220
Okay, good.

03:22.480 --> 03:30.200
When I speak of errors, I don't say that maybe someday someone won't reduce things in size

03:30.200 --> 03:34.420
through some horrid bypassing of the laws of quantum mechanics.

03:34.840 --> 03:42.680
At the same time, I'm extremely doubtful that a type word term really looks like that.

03:44.340 --> 03:52.780
And before you blame artist Paul, the author described the various organisms which were

03:52.780 --> 03:59.420
met with and this delicately nurtured and healthy young lady's body in considerable detail.

03:59.420 --> 04:02.940
And the illustration wasn't all that bad.

04:04.760 --> 04:13.900
As far as the description went, there were fangs and glaring eyes of what a typhoid germ or

04:14.700 --> 04:16.320
maybe this was the tetanus one.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.640
I don't really remember now.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.460
Would be doing with eyes.

04:19.680 --> 04:24.100
I'm not entirely clear considering the amount of light probably available.

04:27.380 --> 04:30.380
Anyway, it was a nice adventurous story.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.080
I enjoyed it when I read it back in my middle teens.

04:36.020 --> 04:41.940
And I didn't find it all that bad when I re-read it a few years ago after I latched

04:41.940 --> 04:44.100
onto a couple of copies of the magazine again.

04:44.260 --> 04:45.840
Don't think I got them from you, Howard, sorry.

04:49.700 --> 04:53.020
Anyway, in this whole theme, the story, was the question.

04:53.020 --> 04:55.840
Are you entertaining somebody?

04:57.080 --> 04:58.380
Maybe you aren't.

04:58.380 --> 05:05.060
If he's the sort of person who wants every story he reads to have a moral or a political

05:05.060 --> 05:06.780
point or something of that sort.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.980
But even something like this can be entertaining.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.820
And it's one little fragment of insanity.

05:13.220 --> 05:16.140
Okay, let's see if it changes faster today.

05:20.260 --> 05:21.240
Yeah, it does.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.240
I'm getting some things out of the way.

05:25.560 --> 05:29.200
Remember, I have been an astronomy nut for 47 years.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.240
From the beginning to me, science fiction was rocket chips and Martians.

05:34.700 --> 05:40.220
And I'm simply proving for the first few slides that I'm not a completely closed mind type.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.800
You can have science fiction in other places.

05:43.640 --> 05:50.320
And this slide in the next, for example, going to the question of how about re-engineering

05:50.320 --> 05:52.600
human beings so they can breathe water.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.000
This was Norman Knight's story.

05:55.340 --> 05:56.760
And well, the date's all there.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.200
I don't have to brag about my memory this time, Christ is in Utopia.

06:02.120 --> 06:09.340
And one could do a little bit of criticizing about those foreign type kills for a number of reasons.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.540
But I won't.

06:12.780 --> 06:17.800
Another theme, a variation of the same theme, and here's what I'm starting into.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.380
The infinite variations is in the next slide.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.440
This had nothing to do with genetic manipulation.

06:24.620 --> 06:25.780
Okay, let's have the next one.

06:27.380 --> 06:28.700
This was an accident.

06:29.180 --> 06:33.080
And having been written by Sprague de Camp, it was a rather humorous accident.

06:33.600 --> 06:38.820
And for aquarium assistant to have been experimenting in his spare time on a drug

06:38.820 --> 06:44.040
that would alter lung tissue sufficiently to permit an air breath that would breathe under water,

06:45.180 --> 06:50.300
and accidentally got a few whiffs of his own drug and found he couldn't breathe air,

06:50.540 --> 06:54.020
and was running off for help from his office after the aquarium head,

06:54.780 --> 07:02.920
passed out from lack of air, fell into a dark tank, and had problems for the next 24 hours or so.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.180
As I say, with Sprague, it was more funny than serious science.

07:08.180 --> 07:14.620
But Sprague stuck with the custom of the time and came up with a fairly

07:15.760 --> 07:18.600
logical sounding excuse for the whole thing.

07:18.840 --> 07:25.380
He remembered details like handling the reflex, which would ordinarily prevent

07:25.380 --> 07:27.660
a person from breathing water.

07:27.920 --> 07:33.020
We do have some automatic controls there, which are supposed to keep water out of the windpipe.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.640
And once again, it was a good story.

07:36.260 --> 07:39.720
But let's get on closer and closer to the rocket ships and Martians.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.320
So I don't remember just what comes next, and I can't continue the talk until it does.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.700
Okay, this is still a way back lamp.

07:49.720 --> 07:54.820
The next three slides deal with Jack Williamson's Legion of Space,

07:55.460 --> 08:00.700
pure beautiful formula type space opera, which I love then and I love now,

08:01.340 --> 08:05.260
about which you could start branching out on,

08:05.620 --> 08:09.900
all right, so I ended the phrase with a preposition, indefinitely.

08:10.420 --> 08:19.060
In this particular story, they were chasing off to Bernard's Runaway Star to preserve the solar

08:19.060 --> 08:25.800
system from the pirate Medusa, and incidentally to save the girl who had been kidnapped and

08:25.800 --> 08:30.480
zipped off to the star to get the secret of the invincible weapon from her.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.360
This was the 1930s.

08:33.660 --> 08:35.420
The point is that

08:37.520 --> 08:45.180
that same story could have been written and probably has been written,

08:46.140 --> 08:51.380
not only with other variations, but from various other viewpoints.

08:52.380 --> 08:58.320
Now, the Medusa, the Megans of Barnard's Star, and that's supposed to be Barnard's Star,

08:59.860 --> 09:00.820
were the villains.

09:02.980 --> 09:06.820
They, actually, Jack was not as ruthless as he sometimes is.

09:06.960 --> 09:12.660
He had destroyed the Earth's moon and wiped out the outpost of the Medusa there at the end of

09:12.660 --> 09:17.420
the story, but as far as I know, he allowed Barnard's Star to continue on its way,

09:18.060 --> 09:19.500
the Medusa is still there.

09:21.340 --> 09:25.720
I wouldn't know, I had just a little touch of sympathy for those critters.

09:26.420 --> 09:30.100
I didn't blame them for wanting to move from this place.

09:30.380 --> 09:32.980
Let's go on to the next picture while we're at it.

09:34.580 --> 09:39.920
And I didn't blame them particularly for defending their planet with the belt of peril,

09:40.160 --> 09:42.380
which Jack described in such detail.

09:43.580 --> 09:50.040
There were refugees from their own environment, as Jack described it, but you could be sorry for

09:50.040 --> 09:50.280
them.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.520
There was only one city full of them left before creatures.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.120
The city is in the next picture.

09:57.120 --> 10:01.640
And you could write a lot of stories about the Medusa's side of the affair,

10:02.060 --> 10:06.080
or what the Medusa did before, or what the Medusa did afterwards.

10:07.000 --> 10:07.860
It's branching.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.980
This is my point, these branches.

10:11.660 --> 10:14.700
And as soon as you write one of those stories, it's going to branch, too.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.120
So let's keep on with the branches.

10:18.380 --> 10:21.000
Don't blame me for the description there, by the way.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.760
I don't know how you could get a sky that red.

10:24.080 --> 10:30.160
Jack said that there was an organic aerosol designed to trap the heat, which made the sky

10:30.160 --> 10:30.880
look red.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.940
So the picture was painted with a red sky.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.200
Don't let that worry you.

10:36.320 --> 10:40.440
You've all read at least some of Spratly Camp's Krishna stories.

10:41.060 --> 10:48.140
This is an illustration from the Hand of Zay, a time in which the Shambor was

10:48.140 --> 10:52.860
fleeing a couple of pursuing valleys and aided through a straight two shallow

10:53.420 --> 10:58.600
for the valleys by taking advantage of the fact that Krishna's three moons all happened

10:58.600 --> 11:02.600
conveniently to be full and in conjunction simultaneously.

11:02.760 --> 11:03.760
It made a nice picture.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.980
And it made a nice story.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.560
But variations again.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.620
Well Sprat did so many of the variations.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.580
There's no point in pursuing that thing.

11:13.580 --> 11:18.800
You've read Rogue Queen, Get Along, Tower of Zanad.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.300
Rogue Queen was the most popular, but I'm not entirely sure it was the best.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.300
It was very good.

11:26.700 --> 11:27.140
Okay.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.700
Well, I have to get myself into it too here and there.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.420
Some of you may or may not recognize the same.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.800
We hope for the best.

11:41.800 --> 11:48.700
This is the Sunless Planet all the way in, which you've been a story for the first of the stellar

11:48.700 --> 11:49.620
anthologies.

11:50.300 --> 11:54.060
It was in the vicinity of the Orion Nubbiler, which shows in the background.

11:54.620 --> 11:59.320
This is the point near the beginning of the story where the native is pausing to catch dinner.

12:00.240 --> 12:05.960
You remember he had an interesting personality, which he didn't have all that self-control

12:05.960 --> 12:08.160
when it came to satisfying his hunger.

12:08.800 --> 12:16.000
And his human passenger was in no position to be in a hurry because you never quite knew

12:16.000 --> 12:17.740
how you'd want to satisfy his hunger.

12:18.240 --> 12:23.500
So he permitted the fellow to stop and catch a fish to eat it.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.840
The next painting shows the planet itself.

12:27.600 --> 12:31.440
This was the point I started as far as I know.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.100
Yeah.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.000
Next one if you can.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.160
The Possibility of Sunless Planets.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.600
Well, I didn't really start it.

12:41.680 --> 12:49.380
Neilar Jones had one of his Professor Jameson stories back in 1934, December 34, and I know

12:49.380 --> 12:51.420
because it's the first magazine I ever bought.

12:55.720 --> 13:01.340
However, dear Mr. Jones, fondness I have always been of the Professor Jameson stories

13:01.340 --> 13:03.120
didn't know all that much science.

13:03.660 --> 13:10.860
And his Sunless World was hollow, which is extremely difficult to justify on any astrophysical grounds.

13:12.060 --> 13:16.880
I came up with the notion that any sort of reasonable theory of planet formation and star

13:16.880 --> 13:22.240
formation suggests strongly that there should be lots of objects out there, which are too small

13:22.240 --> 13:23.240
to be suns.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.000
And you may as well call them planets.

13:25.640 --> 13:30.300
And if they're sufficiently late generation objects, such as something in the Orion Nebula

13:30.300 --> 13:36.780
might be, they could easily have enough heavy elements, uranium and thorium, so that at places

13:36.780 --> 13:42.580
on their surfaces, they might be warm enough to have liquid water or in this particular case,

13:42.680 --> 13:44.280
I think I use liquid hydrazine.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.580
That's what the hell, just a variation.

13:48.340 --> 13:55.800
Some science fiction writers are very, very ethical in that connection, by the way.

13:55.800 --> 14:01.660
I had started a story on this theme somewhere in the early 1960s.

14:01.660 --> 14:05.440
I ran into Paul Anderson at a AAAS meeting and told him about it.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.060
I'd gotten tied up and it died on me.

14:08.140 --> 14:12.860
And if I could finish, I got my character into a hole that I couldn't get him out of.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.780
This was a rewrite of it, but I had to start over.

14:16.400 --> 14:21.360
And I told Paul about this and Karen and we were talking however, how I could get out of it.

14:21.360 --> 14:27.800
Paul, believe it or not, felt that he should write Sunless World Stories because I had come up

14:27.800 --> 14:28.460
with the idea.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.800
Well, that's being too damn ethical.

14:31.760 --> 14:39.320
I'm all for ethics, but as far as I'm concerned, Sunless planets are probably a fact of nature

14:39.320 --> 14:41.440
and I have no copyright on them.

14:41.660 --> 14:45.560
And if any of you want to write stories about Sunless Worlds, fine.

14:46.060 --> 14:48.520
If you want to write stories about all between them,

14:48.520 --> 14:50.980
write me and I'll give you more of its specifications.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.960
I'm all for it.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.520
Let's pursue the variations.

14:57.040 --> 15:01.100
Let's get a little closer to infinity and if any mathematician shoots, I'll shoot back.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.020
That's, at least I could recognize it from a glance.

15:10.760 --> 15:16.440
That's one of the standard far future ones, but one of the better done far future ones.

15:16.440 --> 15:21.700
That's the earth about 3 billion years from now, as described in a fair amount of detail

15:21.700 --> 15:27.000
by Paul Anderson in his story, Epilogue, which I think should have got a hero.

15:27.980 --> 15:35.320
It was a beautiful job in which the formula part of it was explorers with the first faster

15:35.320 --> 15:40.380
than light drive inadvertently taking full time to go where they went and they got back

15:40.380 --> 15:41.840
about 3 billion years later.

15:43.280 --> 15:48.680
But it was the theme was a very good one, which should be followed in more detail.

15:50.260 --> 15:55.320
It was written shortly after that article in Scientific American, which talked about

15:55.320 --> 16:03.700
self replicating machines, which would be set floating on the ocean to take minerals

16:03.700 --> 16:06.180
and all supplies metals and so on from the water.

16:06.600 --> 16:10.680
They would not only do this to be able to replicate themselves and put new little machines

16:10.680 --> 16:14.280
which would grow, I use the variation of the theme later in the mechanic.

16:15.720 --> 16:21.140
In Paul's story, the 3 billion years from now, the sun had climbed some distance among the

16:21.140 --> 16:23.840
well above the main sequence as it probably will.

16:24.060 --> 16:24.920
It was a good deal hotter.

16:25.680 --> 16:31.880
Earth was no longer habitable for life of our type, but some of those machines had

16:32.680 --> 16:39.560
survived, just mutated, and the chief character was a rather humanoid descendant of the machines.

16:40.680 --> 16:44.240
And it was a damn good story and I still think it should have had a hero.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.980
Well, that was the Earth's font there.

16:48.160 --> 16:55.420
No vegetation left, browns, blacks, tans, areas that were sparkly, plant growths had,

16:56.150 --> 17:03.280
I suppose, silicon cells, though Paul didn't exactly specify, but there was

17:03.280 --> 17:12.340
an energy absorbing variety of life and a variety equivalent to animal life, though it had a few

17:12.340 --> 17:14.540
abilities denied to us.

17:14.720 --> 17:20.840
As some of the food it ate, instead of eating, it could take spare parts and insert them directly,

17:21.340 --> 17:22.920
bypassing a lot of chemistry.

17:24.440 --> 17:29.180
In fact, the chief character suffered injury during the story.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.820
Got one of his forearms blown off.

17:32.400 --> 17:40.000
His wife, I guess we can use the word, an immobile, almost immobile version of the machinery

17:40.000 --> 17:45.740
was producing at the time and they were able to take a replacement arm from the unborn child and

17:45.740 --> 17:50.540
fasten it onto daddy and just leave the child to cook a little longer.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.640
And yeah, I like this story.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.020
All right, let's go on.

18:00.780 --> 18:06.760
Where again, this is part of a collaboration between Paul and me.

18:07.440 --> 18:13.120
Somebody many years ago wrote a letter to John Campbell reminding him of the,

18:13.840 --> 18:18.920
remember those twain triplet things, the petrified planet where three different authors were asked

18:18.920 --> 18:20.820
to write a story about the same planet.

18:21.780 --> 18:25.400
This one was one with silicon-based life surprise.

18:26.140 --> 18:30.980
Let's follow, read to John Campbell and ask why some more of this wasn't done,

18:31.740 --> 18:34.300
specifically suggesting that Paul and I be used.

18:35.720 --> 18:41.060
John, being the sort of person he was, instantly Xeroxed the letter and sent copies to Paul and me.

18:42.080 --> 18:47.220
And for the next five years or so, we corresponded, gradually building up a solar system,

18:47.780 --> 18:48.700
planetary system.

18:49.120 --> 18:53.220
I worked out the astronomy, he worked out the planetary ecology.

18:53.220 --> 18:57.700
Each of us making suggestions to the other, but we were responsible for it that way.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.040
The final question was where was this thing going to go?

19:01.300 --> 19:07.320
It was a system with a G-type star, sun-type star with fairly earth-like planets,

19:07.460 --> 19:09.020
or at least one fairly earth-like planet.

19:09.800 --> 19:14.060
And the other member of the binary system was a somewhat more massive star,

19:14.220 --> 19:17.700
which is now off the main sequence and gone up to a red giant stage.

19:18.440 --> 19:23.640
And I worked out all the temperatures that would happen as the star moved around its orbit.

19:24.220 --> 19:27.000
And then the question was where would it be in space?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.600
Because red giants are highly luminous objects,

19:30.160 --> 19:36.400
and we had to fit those into somebody's universe and explain why it hadn't been found from the earth.

19:36.780 --> 19:39.440
It wasn't enormously far away.

19:40.020 --> 19:44.060
And it wasn't, and I said, okay, let's put it right in front of a globular cluster,

19:44.060 --> 19:50.880
where nobody will notice it from earth, at least for a few million years until we get out of line.

19:51.600 --> 19:58.660
And Paul bought that, and this is a photo, excuse me, a painting of the system seen from

19:58.660 --> 20:03.600
fairly close to. Some of you probably read the only story that's come out of this thing so far,

20:03.640 --> 20:04.780
Paul's fire time.

20:06.520 --> 20:10.900
Theoretically, I have equal rights in it, and someday I may write something about the same system,

20:10.900 --> 20:14.060
but being a spare time writer, I haven't gotten around to it.

20:14.700 --> 20:18.580
But again, there's an infinite number of variations here.

20:18.960 --> 20:22.280
I'll probably write my stories on planets of the red giant,

20:22.520 --> 20:28.380
which may have had life in the past, and in fact, or established as having had life in the past,

20:28.760 --> 20:32.420
but they're going to be overcooked now, and I'm going to have my people walking around

20:33.200 --> 20:36.140
in temperatures much too high for convenient life.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.180
I'll think of something to happen, but I'll know when.

20:38.180 --> 20:42.500
The next couple of pictures are illustrations from the same general thing.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.420
Most of them are mine.

20:48.360 --> 20:56.060
That's the planet, the Ishtar. Paul worked out the geography, the continent arrangement.

20:56.500 --> 21:01.900
I did the picture as a present for him. This is set up close to fire time, a view from Ishtar's

21:01.900 --> 21:08.060
moon with one side of it lighted by its own sun, and the other much more dimly lighted by the

21:08.060 --> 21:14.440
approaching red giants. It's the reflection of the giant in the ocean here as you see the reflection

21:14.440 --> 21:20.000
of the moon or sun from space. Okay.

21:26.840 --> 21:32.420
Paul was the naming. He follows the tradition of using mythological

21:33.360 --> 21:39.640
gods from this, that, or the other. Noth-tentheon was the word I want, religion anyway.

21:41.660 --> 21:49.080
He named all the planets after the Babylonian bunch. He worked that very logically. I don't

21:49.080 --> 21:54.020
remember enough Babylonian mythology now to figure out exactly what he did, but the planets

21:56.340 --> 22:04.760
of the Fall-type star were named after children of one of the major gods, and the planets of

22:04.760 --> 22:09.380
the other star were named after children of the other. He was very careful about that. I don't

22:09.380 --> 22:17.220
remember them all now myself. That the landscape on the planets as fire time was coming, the regular

22:17.220 --> 22:23.480
sun is setting and the red giant is in the sky, bringing its warnings of doom and all that to the

22:23.480 --> 22:30.160
life forms. I should write a story or two on that planet as well. I can't say anyone do it

22:30.160 --> 22:35.100
or want this time because it's not entirely my property to do it with, but if it weren't for

22:35.100 --> 22:40.220
that I'd say go ahead. And if you want a system like that that isn't this same one,

22:41.080 --> 22:46.260
write me, and I like to cook up planetary systems. I've done it for friends occasionally.

22:47.560 --> 22:53.140
But the themes are endless. The one, the version that we cropped up with on this one,

22:53.140 --> 23:00.720
and which Paul mentioned, and which can go on, was that the life on the planets of what is now a

23:00.720 --> 23:06.880
red giant had had the other kind of amino acids, which ordinarily wouldn't happen, both wouldn't

23:06.880 --> 23:12.960
happen on the same planet, I don't think, whichever one first developed replicating power would

23:12.960 --> 23:20.540
take over the chemistry. But the intelligent beings from the red giant two or three billion

23:20.540 --> 23:27.300
years ago before it was a red giant had colonized the planets of the yellow star, and traces of

23:27.300 --> 23:32.540
their occupation still remain, whether the life forms were descendants of the intelligent

23:34.360 --> 23:39.660
colonists or descendants of the bacteria they brought with them, I wouldn't know after four

23:39.660 --> 23:46.320
billion years who would know. But this planet had life forms on it, some of which were

23:46.320 --> 23:52.480
all the types of amino acid, and the others were the mirror image, which produced an ecology which

23:52.480 --> 23:56.180
Paul had a great deal of fun with. Okay.

24:02.940 --> 24:09.520
This was almost on the side, and it's a painting of mine as well, and it represents an ambition I

24:09.520 --> 24:16.540
had never succeeded in fulfilling. That is not direct of Pauline VII, one of Doc Smith's characters,

24:16.740 --> 24:22.220
it was partially fourth dimensional, and I want someday to paint a believable fourth dimensional

24:22.220 --> 24:29.220
picture, but I just haven't succeeded yet. And I brought it in to mention that the fourth dimension

24:29.220 --> 24:37.420
is used rather frequently, and has its own little infinity of story ideas, and I won't pursue that

24:37.420 --> 24:51.060
one any further. There is a theme which has taken rather deep hold in the culture in the last 10

24:51.060 --> 25:01.940
years or so, which also allows itself to be used in a variety of ways, especially playing the science

25:01.940 --> 25:10.340
fiction game, capital letters. The game used to be that the author did his dam list to write a story

25:10.340 --> 25:17.080
with no scientific errors in it, and after he had it published, the readers did the dam list to find

25:17.080 --> 25:27.580
errors and write nasty letters to the editor's column. It is an unfair game. The author really is at

25:27.580 --> 25:32.380
the short end of this stick. Once he's written and published the story, he's made all the moves he's

25:32.380 --> 25:38.600
allowed, and everyone else can jump on him for the next 40 years of his bookstays in print,

25:38.700 --> 25:49.100
God willing. There's a better way, and I will credit Gene Roddenberry for indirectly and not

25:49.100 --> 25:54.700
deliberately, but as a result of his activities, teaching me that better way. Never mind shooting

25:54.700 --> 26:00.220
down a Star Trek episode because it has a scientific error here and there. That is ethically

26:00.220 --> 26:08.000
shooting a sitting bird. It is much better and much more of an intellectual exercise and much

26:08.000 --> 26:16.020
more fun to take a Star Trek episode or a science fiction story, assume that it is accurate reporting

26:16.020 --> 26:22.800
from soup to nuts, and then try to fill in the scientific background, the things that would

26:22.800 --> 26:32.000
have to be true so that it could be accurate reporting. This is sometimes a job. The first

26:32.000 --> 26:39.860
time I tackled it was the episode Dorothy Fontana's This Side of Paradise, which is a very nice,

26:39.940 --> 26:46.260
earth-like planet in which everybody was perfectly healthy because of those damned spores,

26:47.100 --> 26:54.480
which also were very efficient tranquilizers. And the only catch really, aside from the fact

26:54.480 --> 27:01.280
that nobody ever said just what bare-fold rays were, that it was stated to be a planet of Omicron

27:01.280 --> 27:16.240
City, specifically Omicron City 3. Omicron City is otherwise known as Myra, but it is a red,

27:16.240 --> 27:26.200
eyes for human beings. And Circle Rat Sun was a challenge to repeat myself. I faced a talk on it

27:26.200 --> 27:31.020
at the first of the New York Star Trek convention, the one where they were expecting maybe six or

27:31.020 --> 27:36.680
800 and stopped counting at around 2500 and sort of started the theme. But the talk went

27:36.680 --> 27:42.420
over well and I kept doing this for several years and it's great fun. And of course, every damn time

27:42.420 --> 27:49.480
you fill in the background like this, there's about 500 more storylines. The next few slides

27:50.360 --> 27:55.660
go through some of the ones that did and I'll be brief as I can. No, they don't either, for God.

27:56.820 --> 28:03.660
That was a strictly decorated one which was inspired by, oh there, someone's from

28:03.660 --> 28:10.140
Master, let's complete these. Milano, come on, I blanked.

28:15.540 --> 28:22.660
I've got Lovecraft inspired one and I probably didn't mean to flip the slide in just that place,

28:22.760 --> 28:28.960
but since it's there, it's there. And let's go on anyway. Lovecraft has his own infinity of the

28:28.960 --> 28:35.940
branches that they threw at me first. And this was meant to branch us into the

28:37.020 --> 28:41.500
idea of painting. This was about the point I was going to admit that I'd done some of these

28:41.500 --> 28:48.280
paintings, but somebody beat me to the question. You can get emotional as well as scientific about

28:48.280 --> 28:53.600
this. This was meant just through a sort of impressionistic painting, the title was Ion

28:53.600 --> 28:59.280
Storm, and I'm quite sure that the Ion Storm in that particular Star Trek episode didn't look

28:59.280 --> 29:03.720
like that, but it was fun to paint anyway. Somebody bought it, which is all of the good.

29:05.340 --> 29:08.660
The next one I think is in the same general line.

29:10.700 --> 29:16.740
Yeah, the skull doesn't show up as well on the slide as it did in the original painting. It's

29:16.740 --> 29:21.660
called Chalador Passage and it came from James Schmitz's Witches of Paris.

29:24.140 --> 29:30.220
And it was kind of fun to do. And someone bought that book. They do sometimes, okay.

29:33.500 --> 29:40.360
And here I have to admit that I made mistakes as well. This is entitled Castor Close-Up,

29:41.120 --> 29:48.540
and it reflects the idea I had of the castor system, for I'm embarrassed to admit most of my

29:48.540 --> 29:53.880
professional life. And the only lucky thing is that I never did try to write a story on that

29:53.880 --> 30:00.960
particular one. The idea is that castor as seen from Earth is a binary in any moderately good

30:00.960 --> 30:09.660
telescope. You see this star and this star. Some distance away, there's a much fainter star,

30:09.900 --> 30:18.140
castor C, YY Geminaurum, and the triple system. All three of the stars are spectroscopic binaries.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.140
I have yacked for, I don't remember when we finally got started, but I'm sure it's been over an hour.

30:32.080 --> 30:37.240
I will not feel hurt if anyone wants to go out, eat, suffer by an orange, buy some coffee.

30:37.820 --> 30:42.200
On the other hand, I am perfectly willing to sit there and answer questions until the cows come

30:42.200 --> 30:45.880
home or the committee says the room is needed for the next whatever is going on.

30:47.320 --> 30:50.200
So here I am, here you are if you want to stay.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.920
I'm going to get off my seat. Yes.

30:57.920 --> 31:04.020
I would like to see the first Viking shot because they had, I guess, a PBS had some

31:04.020 --> 31:07.900
sort of coverage. Many were discussed when they were coming. The first shot seemed to have a

31:07.900 --> 31:12.540
sort of swirl effect in the atmosphere. This is Jupiter to Mars.

31:16.920 --> 31:22.220
Well, don't remember the early Viking ones. I didn't see the TV presentation. When Marin and

31:22.220 --> 31:31.020
9 first went by, Viking 1 and 2 were the recent landers. I didn't see those swirls,

31:31.080 --> 31:35.360
I don't know. It could have been dust. Marin and 9, you remember when it first arrived,

31:35.500 --> 31:39.360
had to wait a month before it could get any good pictures because of a practically

31:39.360 --> 31:44.920
planet-wide dust storm. The pictures were very similar to the one you showed here, the Rocky

31:44.920 --> 31:51.220
surface. It also had that swirl effect. They were very airplane. I haven't seen them, so I can't

31:51.220 --> 32:04.200
offer one either. The Viking have measured them. Originally, from Marin and 4 along,

32:04.360 --> 32:11.160
they were calculated from occultation effects. The radio beam from the probe, as it went behind

32:11.160 --> 32:15.280
Mars, went through successively different deeper layers of atmosphere and they were able to get

32:15.280 --> 32:19.660
some pretty precise stuff from that. But now they have direct pressures as well. Rather interesting.

32:19.660 --> 32:26.820
The air is mostly carbon dioxide. During the time from the Vikings' landers' first measurements,

32:27.060 --> 32:32.900
and the time they shut it off because Mars had gone beyond the sun, the total air pressure had

32:32.900 --> 32:39.700
run down about 10%. The presumption was, it was winter at the North Pole and the atmosphere was

32:39.700 --> 32:47.980
freezing out as CO2 in the North Polar ice cap. Wait a minute, North Pole, I was thinking.

32:49.820 --> 32:51.980
No, it's South Pole in winter now. I'm sorry.

32:55.420 --> 33:02.280
Carbon dioxide by far. Dry ice temperature under air pressure is about minus 78 Celsius.

33:02.860 --> 33:06.140
Oxygen freezing point, I don't know exactly, but it's more like minus 200.

33:09.700 --> 33:10.220
Yes.

33:33.620 --> 33:39.680
This is quite possible. This is possibly what happened. The camera was taking a very narrow

33:40.540 --> 33:47.420
spot image. The probe was spinning, I think, about three times a second. And the spot

33:47.420 --> 33:54.360
trailed across the planet, whipped around, trailed across a slightly energization band and so on.

33:54.700 --> 33:59.420
And I assume it was the sort of getting out of step which we suggested was produced for this sort of thing.

34:08.140 --> 34:08.700
Tyson.

34:09.460 --> 34:14.360
Would you think that the sunlight on that thing would also be blue?

34:16.800 --> 34:23.300
Not if the reason is what it seems to be. If the color, the reddish or orange color which Titan

34:23.300 --> 34:29.620
shows in the telescope is due to colored gases like oxides of nitrogen, then no, it's not a

34:29.620 --> 34:36.160
scattering effect. It's an absorption effect and the light will be red regardless of the direction

34:36.160 --> 34:41.620
you look. Orange or red. Have you taken high school chemistry and seen what happens when you drop

34:41.620 --> 34:46.800
the copper into nitric acid, the political reddish brown stinking fumes that come off? That's the

34:46.800 --> 34:57.620
stuff. In O2. We don't know that that's it, by the way, but it's about the simplest guess. Yes.

35:06.160 --> 35:12.780
Uh, my background is, I didn't discover scientific fiction in 1950s. After I took on the

35:12.780 --> 35:18.740
conversion project, I got science fiction. And I can remember feeling very different from you.

35:19.080 --> 35:23.200
I read all this speculation about art because it seemed that I would never know.

35:25.200 --> 35:25.760
Yeah.

35:26.040 --> 35:30.540
You were reading back in the 30s that you have this. Why is he saying that he someday

35:30.540 --> 35:32.880
would be giving a lecture with extra fiction?

35:33.240 --> 35:40.140
I was firmly convinced of it. I have only recently and very reluctantly given up hope

35:40.140 --> 35:46.500
of visiting the Moon and Mars personally. I have reached the age of 54 and it doesn't look as though

35:46.500 --> 35:51.620
I would be able to pay for a passenger ticket to either place. And I know damn well I'm too old

35:51.620 --> 35:58.260
to be taken as a pilot or researcher. I haven't flown an airplane for 23 years, let alone a rocket.

36:00.700 --> 36:07.740
I'd love to go. I don't know what I'd give to go, but it would be most of what I own.

36:09.960 --> 36:16.600
All I can say is I haven't drawn as raw a deal as for Willie Lay. He died a month before the

36:16.600 --> 36:21.620
first moon landing. Yes.

36:21.620 --> 36:28.260
You can delight you some progress that was very interesting. Trying to find a new

36:29.260 --> 36:34.440
drive for a spaceship like possibly using the anti-gravity. I mean, you know,

36:34.500 --> 36:43.040
the question there is a very, very hard one to answer. If you say someone like me says that he's

36:43.040 --> 36:48.700
has his doubts about the possibility of anti-gravity, well, I risk letting my button sniffed off and

36:48.700 --> 36:55.560
drummed out of the science fiction core. At the same time, I try to say this in a way to

36:55.560 --> 37:01.000
justify my pessimism without sounding as though my imagination is completely disintegrated.

37:02.300 --> 37:10.020
Anything like that would demand what we generally call a breakthrough. A genuinely new discovery

37:10.020 --> 37:16.320
in the basic laws of physics. I don't say that this is impossible. I simply say there is no

37:16.320 --> 37:22.520
way to evaluate its chance. And justifying the spending of public money on it is even more

37:22.520 --> 37:29.140
difficult. I am greatly in favor of some millionaire who's got his own money and is interested in it.

37:30.560 --> 37:38.080
Researching anti-gravity or flying saucers or astrology, if he wants. I just feel that none

37:38.080 --> 37:43.640
of those things are probable enough, given what we know, think of as the rules of the game,

37:43.640 --> 37:50.440
to justify a very large fraction of our available efforts being spent on them.

37:53.800 --> 37:59.180
Yeah, its first one is rolled out. It was undergoing what you might call captive flight

37:59.180 --> 38:04.380
tests, isn't it being pinned on top of a 747 or something like that, having its aerodynamic

38:04.380 --> 38:09.740
qualities worked out. I don't know when its first orbital flight is scheduled for, but they're working

38:09.740 --> 38:17.580
on it. I think they'll ever have a really a passage. I think eventually yes, granting the

38:17.580 --> 38:23.780
continuation of our technological culture, which we may or may not manage to keep up. I happen to

38:23.780 --> 38:30.020
be in favor of it strongly. I like my little pocket calculators and the intellectual exercises they

38:30.020 --> 38:35.040
make possible. I'm quoting almost directly from my article on atomic power in the current Galileo

38:35.040 --> 38:43.000
at the moment. I like to get much more crude about it. I much prefer toilet paper made for the

38:43.000 --> 38:47.900
purpose to any of the substitutes I've had to use on the farm and in camping during my lifetime.

38:48.820 --> 38:55.540
From all of those various levels, I am very much in favor of a highly technical culture. I like books.

38:57.380 --> 39:05.740
Yeah, we have it. And while I suppose I might survive in one in which our technology was gone,

39:06.140 --> 39:11.240
and 95% of the population would have to spend 18 hours a day muscle-powered dirt farming,

39:11.680 --> 39:17.000
I don't think I'd enjoy it. I have done muscle-powered dirt farming. My uncles in Canada were farmers.

39:17.480 --> 39:23.540
I used to spend the summer with them. And frankly, pulling turnips is a useful and noble

39:23.540 --> 39:25.240
action, but it's not for me.

39:27.780 --> 39:28.120
Yep.

39:38.940 --> 39:43.280
I don't know what I would have to sell a year to make a living because I don't make my living at it.

39:43.320 --> 39:48.300
I'm a high school science teacher and science fiction writing and science fiction painting

39:48.300 --> 39:54.580
are paying hobbies. I am not particularly embarrassed, but I don't know if the answer is

39:54.580 --> 40:03.060
very useful. Last year, between painting and selling, but the selling included money from

40:03.060 --> 40:09.320
books like Mission of Gravity published 25 years ago, I grossed about $6,500 to $7,000,

40:11.440 --> 40:19.580
or on the order, well, rather less than half my teaching salary. So I'm not living on science fiction.

40:21.280 --> 40:27.420
Probably. I can't speak for all of them. I think Paul Anderson makes his entire living by writing,

40:27.660 --> 40:32.760
but not entirely science fiction. Isaac Dezimov, of course, makes his living by writing, but

40:33.400 --> 40:37.460
well, he's a special case. He shows withdrawal symptoms if you get in too far from a typewriter.

40:41.140 --> 40:48.040
And most of the other science fiction people I know do not make their living at it. It's

40:48.040 --> 40:57.600
more of a paying hobby as it is with me. I don't know. He sold well enough in his heyday,

40:57.720 --> 41:03.860
so I rather suspect that he did and probably still does. His books are constantly being reprinted.

41:03.860 --> 41:11.720
I mean, I got a modest but not refusable check for about 160 bucks two days ago

41:11.720 --> 41:16.380
for Italian reprint rights for Mission of Gravity. Who am I to sneer at this?

41:18.160 --> 41:23.360
That's why I say the answer may not be all that useful to you. In the beginning, you're not getting

41:23.360 --> 41:27.880
this sort of thing. It's the sort of stuff that accumulates after you've been writing for years.

41:28.720 --> 41:33.720
And maybe eventually I'd be able to retire on it, but fortunately I won't have to depend on it

41:34.280 --> 41:39.800
even then. I'll have those are pension, school, pension, and I don't know if that'll allow me

41:39.800 --> 41:43.580
to collect social security with all that other money rolling in, but I thought I won't need it.

41:46.600 --> 41:47.000
Yeah.

41:47.140 --> 41:50.780
Where's the portion of your story? You start with the science fiction idea and then build the story

41:50.780 --> 41:57.120
around it. That's my technique as a rule. Even with the hard science fiction based on some peculiar

41:57.120 --> 42:04.300
planet, there are still two ways to go at it. My more usual one is to start with the odd ball

42:04.300 --> 42:10.440
planet. I see an article in Sky and Telescope about a peculiar star and I read it up and then I

42:10.440 --> 42:15.360
start figuring, well, how far out would a planet have to be from this star to have an average

42:15.360 --> 42:20.740
earth temperature and what peculiarities would the star produce if it were that far out? How can

42:20.740 --> 42:25.920
I complicate the issue by tilting the axis or making the orbit a little bit eccentric? I had a

42:25.920 --> 42:30.160
great deal of fun with my H225 at that point. I'll have a lot more in the 97s.

42:32.640 --> 42:38.180
And eventually I've got a very peculiar environment which all sorts of odd ball things can happen

42:38.180 --> 42:43.940
and then I can write mission of gravity. The alternative, which I am not so good at doing,

42:44.180 --> 42:50.520
but which is perfectly kosher for playing the game, is to decide what sort of environment you

42:50.520 --> 42:55.320
want for your story. You may even have a pretty good idea of the story already and you know,

42:55.320 --> 43:01.020
the environment it needs and then cook up a planet which could have that environment and

43:01.020 --> 43:06.620
cook up a planetary system in which such a planet could exist. And I would be perfectly

43:06.620 --> 43:13.340
willing to do this if I happen to have the pertinent idea. Not too many science fiction writers

43:13.340 --> 43:17.980
happen to have the background which lets them do this. I'm not bragging and simply mentioning that

43:18.680 --> 43:23.620
not too many writers besides myself major in astronomy as undergraduates.

43:24.880 --> 43:31.960
On the other hand, we're a fairly friendly bunch. We swap information with each other.

43:32.520 --> 43:36.840
Isaac used to call me up on a rather regular basis when he was doing that science column for

43:37.540 --> 43:43.660
what was it? Magazine of Science and Fantasy, I guess, Science Fiction and Fantasy. And he'd

43:43.660 --> 43:48.440
always be calling me up, but he lived near Boston then checking up on astronomical

43:49.220 --> 43:54.500
bits. He's a biochemist. He doesn't know all that much astronomy. In fact, I must regretfully say

43:54.500 --> 43:58.960
that I had just reviewed his book on Alpha Centauri and he made a gross slip, but I won't tell you

43:58.960 --> 44:03.700
what it is. Did you do the sort of scientific preparation for heating? Yes, so what did you do?

44:03.800 --> 44:11.140
Much less. I read up on viruses and there wasn't a hell of a lot known about them in 1940,

44:11.140 --> 44:17.140
which was when I was doing the research. I think it was about 40. Oh, it was earlier than that.

44:17.340 --> 44:24.580
Wait a minute. Well, I got the idea about the summer of 45 and was fooling around picking up

44:24.580 --> 44:30.240
information for the next three years or so. The first version of the story was finished in 48

44:30.840 --> 44:37.320
and sent to John Campbell and he rejected it for a number of excellent reasons. And I did the 40,000

44:37.320 --> 44:45.260
word two-part serial, sold it to him somewhere much later in 48 and it appeared first, I think,

44:45.300 --> 44:52.060
in April and May 49. But the research there was entirely biological and not very much was known

44:52.060 --> 44:58.060
about viruses in those days. So as we're in writing a sequel, as I'm supposed to be doing now, I'm

44:58.060 --> 45:07.000
having to do a lot of covering, but I'm damned if I'll tell you where. A contract initially

45:07.000 --> 45:18.180
said manuscript would be turned in September 1976. By September 1976, I had about 7,500 words done

45:18.180 --> 45:23.820
and spills started. I started over again in Christmas vacation and did about 8,500 more words,

45:23.880 --> 45:29.440
starting from scratch once more. Maybe I can use the first 7,500, but I've got a way to go yet.

45:29.800 --> 45:34.540
The contract has been extended to September 77 and I hope I don't have to strengthen for another

45:34.540 --> 45:38.700
extension. We might want their advance back instead. This would be bad.

45:51.680 --> 45:57.280
Well, this happens and some people can get away with it. I lack the

45:58.360 --> 46:02.520
drawl or self-confidence, whichever you want to call it, to feel sure that I'm one of them.

46:03.080 --> 46:08.600
I have told my wife if she wants to go to her sisters in the Bahamas for spring vacation,

46:09.000 --> 46:13.860
she may go and take our daughter with her. I'm not going. I'm staying home with the typewriter.

46:15.760 --> 46:20.160
Whether two and a half weeks spring vacation will really produce the rest of the book is a

46:20.160 --> 46:25.680
wide open question. But at least I keep getting more ideas and writing them down so maybe something

46:25.680 --> 46:31.360
can happen this spring. I hope so. I'd like to get it off my conscience so I can feel I can do

46:42.080 --> 46:43.900
something else. Yes.

46:47.100 --> 46:55.240
Never. When I've written the, they typed out the final draft. What I told myself firmly is the

46:55.240 --> 47:00.580
final draft. I can just barely bring myself to read it. There's some sort of acute postpartum

47:00.580 --> 47:07.220
depression there. And when it comes out as a book, I feel even worse. I know there are things I

47:07.220 --> 47:12.800
should have done otherwise. Take several years, usually before I can read the book of any sort of

47:12.800 --> 47:13.080
comfort.

47:21.080 --> 47:27.140
Yes. We've got a question here. Well, that's it. That's it. What time is it anyway? Okay.
