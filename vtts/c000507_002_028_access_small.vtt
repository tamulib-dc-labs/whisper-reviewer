Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.240 --> 00:33.560
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.860
And here are your hosts.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.220
This is David Carson.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.080
And Daryl Lane.

00:44.520 --> 00:47.660
The spring and summer of 1982 was a bonanza for science fiction fans.

00:48.140 --> 00:50.640
Never have there been so many good science fiction and fantasy movies.

00:51.020 --> 00:55.600
It began in the spring with some lightweights like the cat people, the road warriors, and the sword and the sorcerer.

00:55.880 --> 00:59.940
But then some real blockbusters began appearing in the theaters and creating long lines of moviegoers.

00:59.940 --> 01:04.700
These heavyweights would include Conan, the Dean of the Dalarantus production of Robert E. Howard's Barbarian Hero.

01:05.120 --> 01:10.320
And then two from Steven Spielberg, the horror fantasy film Poltergeist and the incredibly popular E.T.

01:10.960 --> 01:16.000
Then there was Star Trek II, The Wrath of Khan, a solid production that captured the essence of the television series.

01:16.740 --> 01:22.760
Ridley Scott's Blade Runner was released in mid-summer, around the same time that John Carpenter's science fiction horror film, The Thing, came out.

01:23.160 --> 01:27.660
And Tron, Walt Disney's landmark computer-animated spectacle brought millions to the theaters.

01:27.660 --> 01:34.940
The science fiction radio show spoke recently with a nationally known movie critic, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times, about science fiction in the cinema.

01:35.840 --> 01:41.180
For a number of years, Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel have done a 30-minute television show, Sneak Previews, for PBS.

01:41.940 --> 01:46.960
This year, however, they produced a one-hour show for commercial television that's doing quite well. It's called at the movies.

01:47.380 --> 01:53.560
We asked Ebert if there is any reason for the great popularity of science fiction movies and the large number of them during the summer of 1982.

01:54.800 --> 02:04.220
Yeah, I think that one reason is that science fiction movies are finally getting the special effects that are equal to their content.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.760
When you would read a science fiction book, you would be able to imagine astonishing things happening.

02:10.900 --> 02:17.600
But then when you would go to the movie, especially, let's say, in the 1950s, when there was the last big science fiction boom,

02:17.600 --> 02:21.680
you would see some pretty transparently awful special effects in most of the movies.

02:22.380 --> 02:28.800
And there were some good ones, some of George Powell's productions, for example, but for the most part, the special effects were laughable.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.180
And so the movies were not able to do justice to the ideas in the material.

02:35.060 --> 02:41.860
These new science fiction films, starting with, well, obviously starting with 2001 and then with Silent Running,

02:41.860 --> 02:49.280
which were precursors of the current boom and which for a long time were not followed by any other science, by any other notable science fiction films,

02:50.760 --> 02:59.000
these new films are able to harness enough technology so that the visuals can do justice to the ideas.

03:08.880 --> 03:14.140
In some ways, the recent boom in science fiction and fantasy films makes it difficult to judge which ones are the best.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.960
Right. In a way, the movie fan is like a child on Christmas morning with a large number of presents around him.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.960
It's too much too fast and he doesn't know which toy to turn to.

03:22.360 --> 03:28.140
It will take a while to gain perspective on the summer of 1982, but we asked Ebert about the future of science fiction in the movies.

03:28.140 --> 03:33.820
Will the popularity of science fiction drop off, as it did after the science fiction movie boom of the 1950s?

03:34.900 --> 03:37.560
This is a different kind of boom than the 50s boom.

03:38.740 --> 03:47.240
For the most part, with the exception of movies like Fantastic Planet and Destination Moon, the 50s science fiction boom was a B movie boom.

03:47.480 --> 03:52.400
Most of those pictures were made for double features or for drive-ins.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.400
A lot of them were made by American International on a very low budget.

03:58.060 --> 03:59.240
They were exploitation pictures.

04:00.260 --> 04:09.220
The movies that are being made today are among the all-time top-grossing films ever made, indicating a really deep-seated desire on the part of the audience to go see them.

04:10.140 --> 04:16.400
Another difference is that in the 50s, to a degree, even though television was around in the 50s,

04:16.400 --> 04:23.880
the American people were still going to movies out of habits that they brought over from the pre-television era.

04:24.040 --> 04:30.460
Today, the basic moviegoer is 19 years old, and more than half of all moviegoers are under the age of 25.

04:31.020 --> 04:36.400
So you have different demographics in the audience, and these younger people have traditionally been more interested in science fiction.

04:37.120 --> 04:46.440
So that I think that the big budget science fiction blockbuster is going to continue to be a phenomenon indefinitely.

04:46.940 --> 04:50.440
We'll continue our conversation with film critic Roger Ebert next time.

04:56.740 --> 05:05.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:55.440 --> 05:59.460
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:15.040 --> 06:20.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.640
And here are your hosts.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.840
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson.

06:31.220 --> 06:36.400
We're talking with Roger Ebert, the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times and co-host of the television show at the movies.

06:36.940 --> 06:43.200
Ebert's criticism demonstrates a real knowledge of science fiction, and he communicates a genuine appreciation of the field on his television show.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.200
In fact, we suspect that he might have been a science fiction fan, so we asked him if he grew up reading science fiction.

06:49.200 --> 06:59.520
Yeah, I got some old copies of Astounding and F&SF and Galaxy from a couple of college students who are on my paper route.

06:59.580 --> 07:09.760
They gave me about 900 old magazines, which I still have, so I have volume one number one of a lot of different, you know, in the first year of F&SF and so forth.

07:09.760 --> 07:22.340
So I started reading in, probably in fifth grade, and through high school I contributed to fanzines and I even published a few issues of my own fanzine.

07:22.600 --> 07:28.660
I went to, I think, one science fiction convention, met Tarlan Ellison and Buck and Juanita Coulson.

07:29.480 --> 07:38.140
The summer of 1982 witnessed the greatest explosion of good science fiction movies ever, with huge money makers like ET, Poltergeist, Star Trek II and Tron.

07:38.140 --> 07:45.060
And ET is on its way to being the greatest money maker in Hollywood history. We asked Ebert if the movie is as good as the money it's taken in indicates.

07:45.700 --> 07:52.640
The money that ET has taken in indicates the nature of the market today.

07:52.880 --> 08:00.600
It was a mass market, very popular family entertainment that came out at summertime with more than a thousand theaters at some point playing the film.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.840
And so it can generate revenues like that because of the nature of the market.

08:05.040 --> 08:17.080
Movie is very good and I loved it. And I think it belongs on the same list though, not so much with science fiction movies as with movies like National Velvet, Lassie Come Home.

08:18.020 --> 08:23.340
Movies about, as many other people have also observed, it's kind of a movie about a boy and his dog in a way.

08:24.800 --> 08:32.340
It's more of that than science fiction. I mean technically, of course it's science fiction, but I think the appeal was not because it was science fiction.

08:32.440 --> 08:40.460
The appeal was because of identification with this little boy and something that he learns to care for and something that we learn to care for.

08:41.340 --> 08:46.980
The director of ET, Steven Spielberg, had another smash hit during the summer of 1982, Poltergeist.

08:46.980 --> 08:55.600
Poltergeist is really a horror movie, a thriller with some tense and frightening scenes in it. But the fright doesn't stick with you when you leave the theater. You feel good somehow, even uplifted.

08:55.940 --> 08:59.560
Ebert speculates on what Spielberg's got that has captured people's imagination.

09:01.140 --> 09:08.140
Spielberg has the ability to remember what it was like to be a child.

09:09.180 --> 09:28.860
When I see his movies, and I'm also including something for example like Raiders of the Lost Ark, I am taken back to the feeling that I had when I would read pulp science fiction serials in magazines like Trilling Wonder Stories, Starling Stories, and so forth.

09:29.840 --> 09:36.860
And stuff by Haggard and Burroughs and people like that. He remembers that sense of wonder.

09:37.980 --> 09:45.300
And he also remembers what it was like to be a kid. I think it's interesting that so many of his films have as their locale the American suburbs.

09:45.540 --> 09:50.420
And he grew up in a suburb and you see that suburb in Poltergeist in particular and in ET.

10:00.700 --> 10:05.720
The monetary success of ET and Poltergeist makes us wonder about the quality of science fiction movies in general.

10:06.420 --> 10:12.020
We ask Ebert if it were possible for the quality of a science fiction movie to be as high as that of the great all time movie classics.

10:14.580 --> 10:23.580
Certainly. The British film magazine, Sight and Sound, takes a poll of the world's film critics every ten years to see what are the greatest films of all time.

10:23.580 --> 10:27.940
They've done it in 52, 62, 72 and they're in the process of doing it again now.

10:28.720 --> 10:36.680
And I fully anticipate that when the tallies are added up, 2001 will be included among the ten greatest films ever made.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.220
We'll have some more with Roger Ebert next time.

10:45.820 --> 10:54.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.940
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:05.580 --> 12:10.880
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.180
And here are your hosts.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.500
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

12:21.840 --> 12:26.200
Among the science fiction movies that came out in the summer of 1982 were Blade Runner and The Thing.

12:26.760 --> 12:32.920
Neither movie was as successful as its makers anticipated, though part of the reason for that would have to be the science fiction competition during the summer.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.860
Blockbusters like E.T., Poltergeist and Tron.

12:36.380 --> 12:42.320
Blade Runner was a beautifully produced movie about the near future, during a time when artificial humans or androids can be created.

12:42.320 --> 12:51.480
We asked Roger Ebert, film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times and co-host of the television show At the Movies, if there was any particular reason for the failure of Blade Runner to make a larger splash.

12:52.480 --> 13:00.480
I think the reason for that is that the director never really got interested in the people or androids in his plot.

13:02.760 --> 13:09.820
And the movie was a triumph of set design. It looked great. It was a very interesting looking vision of the future.

13:09.820 --> 13:22.880
And in particular the notion that in so many movies or books, at least in, you know, we're not talking about maybe people who are really familiar with the whole field of science fiction,

13:22.940 --> 13:34.560
but to the general public, the science fiction future is this wonderful stainless steel and four-mic place with towers and rockets jetting around and everybody dressed like a hospital intern and so forth.

13:34.560 --> 13:43.000
And this movie had the imagination to suggest that 40 years from now things are going to be 40 years older. The pollution is going to be 40 years worse.

13:43.700 --> 13:51.640
Poverty is going to be 40 years more deeply ingrained. Crime will be 40 years more ubiquitous and so forth. That was a very interesting vision.

13:52.200 --> 14:05.940
I do feel, though, that the really interesting thing about Blade Runner and probably about the Philip K. Dick material that it started from was centered around the question of what is human, you know.

14:06.480 --> 14:11.860
If the memories that I have are not of a life that I live, does that make them any less my memories?

14:13.000 --> 14:17.840
And Harrison Ford, when I interviewed him, said much the same thing, that that's what attracted him to the material.

14:18.520 --> 14:28.620
The dilemma of which of these people were human and which of these people were not is, as far as their minds were concerned, they all had the same kind of background to call on.

14:29.160 --> 14:33.200
I think that that theme kind of got lost in the middle of those great special effects.

14:33.200 --> 14:42.720
And if the movie had really been willing to follow through on the value questions that it raised, it might have been a more interesting movie.

14:43.980 --> 14:51.200
Now the irony is that I think that one of the reasons it wasn't as successful as it might have been is because it didn't follow through on those questions.

14:51.360 --> 14:58.500
And yet from what I understand, that material was cut out of the movie because they figured it wouldn't be box office. It's better just to have the special effects.

15:08.700 --> 15:13.760
The Thing was the second Hollywood production of John W. Campbell's classic short story, Who Goes There?

15:14.140 --> 15:18.300
It was done by John Carpenter, who specializes in horror movies, his best being Halloween.

15:18.820 --> 15:20.560
We asked Ebert about his views on the movie.

15:21.180 --> 15:28.560
Well, it really had an interesting monster, but it didn't really have people.

15:29.160 --> 15:35.000
Yet I didn't really feel much concerned about the characters in the thing.

15:35.640 --> 15:41.480
And another thing that bothered me, you know, years ago in science fiction fandom, they had the so-called idiot plot.

15:42.520 --> 15:47.240
The plot that can only last as long as the movie because everyone in the movie is an idiot.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.480
Because if somebody wasn't an idiot, they would figure out what to do and do it.

15:51.220 --> 15:59.840
And in The Thing, the characters have an annoying persistent tendency to not do what everyone in the audience knows they should be doing.

16:00.720 --> 16:06.020
You know, they split up. They go outside. They say, you stay right here because I know I can take care of myself.

16:06.660 --> 16:11.140
They trust each other. They do not keep a sense of who was where, when, and why.

16:13.360 --> 16:19.820
In a group of people like that with military discipline, the moment that they figured out what they were up against,

16:19.920 --> 16:25.280
if they had instilled watertight discipline upon themselves, they would have been a lot better off.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.380
But the movie depends upon everybody being an idiot.

16:29.380 --> 16:33.040
Next time, we'll continue our talk with film critic and science fiction fan Roger Ebert.

16:39.680 --> 16:45.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:45.960 --> 16:48.840
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:03.040 --> 17:33.020
The film is a production of the film by the director of the film, Roger Ebert.

17:40.780 --> 17:44.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:00.400 --> 18:05.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.980
And here are your hosts.

18:13.940 --> 18:14.820
This is David B.

18:16.240 --> 18:22.460
Horror and fantasy are two movie categories that are closely related to science fiction, and they've both been very popular in the last year or so.

18:22.880 --> 18:27.320
And the popularity of both of them, as with science fiction, reflects something found in our present society.

18:27.740 --> 18:32.720
We spoke recently with Roger Ebert, film critic and science fiction fan, about the popularity of the field.

18:33.280 --> 18:39.740
We asked him if the Science Fiction Movie Boom reflects our concern with the space program and our desire to get off the earth before we ruin or destroy it.

18:40.680 --> 18:53.340
No, I don't think so. I think maybe some of the fascination with 2001 might have been because it came out at a time when amazing things were happening in space and we were getting ready to land on the moon and so forth.

18:54.100 --> 19:08.600
But I believe that the space movies today, like Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, are identified with primarily in the same way that Rage of the Lost Ark is, as a pick-a-resk adventure.

19:09.740 --> 19:18.620
And when we talk about science fiction, I gather that you and I both kind of tacitly did not include horror films.

19:19.460 --> 19:23.980
I think a psychiatrist might say something like this, or at least I've heard this theory.

19:24.860 --> 19:34.940
It's not so much that the space films indicate our feeling that there's a new frontier to be conquered, as that the monster films indicate our fear of technology.

19:34.940 --> 19:47.200
And there is an old theory that at any time when mankind, in recent years, in the 20th century, when people, when the public has started to feel threatened by the bomb or by technology,

19:47.480 --> 19:53.920
then you get a lot of horror pictures because the message seems to be science will get out of control. Science will kill us.

19:53.920 --> 19:59.100
There'll be some kind of a virus or giant grasshoppers or something will happen.

19:59.780 --> 20:05.920
And scanners or other terrible things will be unleashed upon the population.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.760
Ebert dislikes one particular aspect of current horror movies.

20:10.560 --> 20:15.040
I'll tell you one thing that's happening. I'm getting awfully bored by special effects makeup.

20:16.160 --> 20:26.180
It's only been about 18 months since the big breakthroughs of American werewolf in London and so forth.

20:27.300 --> 20:34.640
And already you get the close up of the face and the jaw begins to pulsate and then the face begins to expand and there's a face inside trying to get out.

20:35.180 --> 20:40.340
I've seen it now. I've seen it so many times that it's boring. I want to get out with a story.

20:45.480 --> 20:54.440
The World of the Dead

20:55.920 --> 21:05.080
Fantasy, as distinguished from science fiction, is also currently popular with movies like The Sword and the Sorcerer, Beastsmaster, The Cat People and Dragonslayer.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.800
We asked Ebert if the quality of fantasy could equal that of current science fiction.

21:09.460 --> 21:16.800
Well, the problem with fantasy is that science fiction is allegedly plausible.

21:17.880 --> 21:22.540
Although we could have a lot of questions about how much, for example, of Star Wars is really plausible.

21:24.100 --> 21:37.180
Fantasy is not supposed to be plausible, but the problem is most fantasy movies seem to be limited to sword and sorcery types of Conan the Barbarian,

21:38.360 --> 21:40.960
the Sword and the Sorcerer, and movies like that.

21:41.580 --> 21:44.020
Or you get an animated film like Lord of the Rings.

21:44.740 --> 21:53.180
I have not seen very much of the kind of fantasy, for example, the fantasy and science fiction magazine helped to popularize.

21:54.520 --> 22:03.000
Fantasy in that it has to do with the whimsy of magic or impossible things intruding into real life.

22:04.100 --> 22:10.020
Those kinds of movies are hard to do and it takes a lot of nerve to do them.

22:10.060 --> 22:18.780
It's one thing to have some broad falling out of her leopard skin bikini and some big brood with a sword and the rippling pectorals and so forth.

22:19.320 --> 22:23.780
But it's another thing to have the imagination to really create a fantasy.

22:30.320 --> 22:39.480
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:31.220 --> 23:35.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:50.320 --> 23:55.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:58.300 --> 23:59.940
And here are your hosts.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.780
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.880
In the late 1930s, science fiction was in transition.

24:10.560 --> 24:15.400
In one sense it was becoming more sophisticated, outgrowing its early emphasis on space opera.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.020
Jack Williamson, who wrote Space Opera, considers this change natural.

24:19.920 --> 24:24.440
I was growing up and the readers were growing up.

24:24.860 --> 24:30.600
That's something that's been going on in science fiction, at least in American science fiction all along.

24:30.720 --> 24:38.420
I think you can draw a distinction between, let's say, European or mainstream science fiction on the one hand,

24:38.540 --> 24:46.840
which has always been recognized and treated as literature and part of American science fiction,

24:46.840 --> 24:48.820
which was looked down on.

24:49.240 --> 24:56.660
But as the readers of that grew older, some of them started writing, some of them started editing magazines,

24:56.960 --> 25:10.380
most of them outgrew science fiction, but some of them didn't, so there was a continual increase in the education, the sophistication, and so forth, the whole field.

25:11.160 --> 25:18.640
Among these readers of pulp science fiction were a few who developed into those authors whose work defined what science fiction would become in later years.

25:19.200 --> 25:27.520
These early readers were people like Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, A. E. Van Vogt, Theodore Sturgeon, L. Sprague de Kamp, Frederick Poel, and Hal Clement.

25:28.200 --> 25:34.920
And these authors are now the classics, those who wrote in that very special period of science fiction called the Golden Age.

25:35.800 --> 25:43.320
A. E. Van Vogt, looking back at that period, says that he read the authors who were starting out then with him, but that he had no idea they were doing anything special.

26:05.040 --> 26:11.800
You know, I mean, we were just doing our thing, and everybody was evidently stimulated in a special way.

26:12.260 --> 26:16.520
Frederick Poel belonged to a group of writers and fans in New York called the Futurians.

26:17.060 --> 26:20.560
He remembers the closeness of the group and how they would help each other.

26:21.480 --> 26:28.980
Well, science fiction has some special traits, and one of them is that its readers herd together as much as they can.

26:28.980 --> 26:34.260
They form fan clubs and associations and correspond to groups and so on.

26:34.960 --> 26:46.240
And in New York City, there were quite a few science fiction fans, and about 25 or 30 most of whom wanted to be writers formed a club called the Futurians.

26:47.000 --> 26:53.560
There are people like Cyril Karnblast, Isaac Asimov, Damon Knight, and myself, quite a few others.

26:53.560 --> 27:02.640
We did discuss each other's work a lot, and I guess in the process of criticizing it, there was a lot of help given.

27:03.260 --> 27:16.700
I think the biggest factor that made it easier for a lot of us to go on with writing was just the knowledge that other people were doing it, and also the fact that we collaborated a lot.

27:16.700 --> 27:32.660
We remedied each other's deficiencies by writing, I mean by collaborating on single stories, and although most of the stories were not very good, we did learn something by seeing how other people would tackle the same subjects we were writing about.

27:33.960 --> 27:43.320
Elsprague de Camp also remembers this closeness among writers at the beginning of the Golden Age, but like VanVote, de Camp says that the authors had no sense of participating in anything special.

27:44.060 --> 28:03.360
Well, I daresay that various ones of us did have their greens and fancies at times, and wondered how it was all going to come out, and would this become, would the genre expand and take over the mainstream and various things of that sort?

28:05.420 --> 28:10.440
But as to that mostly, as I said, it was simply a matter of making a living.

28:10.440 --> 28:15.640
But the living those young writers made is the foundation of today's science fiction.

28:22.900 --> 28:31.600
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:40.440 --> 29:02.580
Thank you for watching.
