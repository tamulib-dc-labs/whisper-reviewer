00:01.280 --> 00:03.640
How did you get interested in costuming?

00:04.340 --> 00:08.760
Well actually, I've always been interested in pretty clothes as it were.

00:09.980 --> 00:15.240
But I actually, to go to where I got interested in costuming, you kind of have to go back to the beginning of fandom.

00:15.940 --> 00:21.040
And for me, I'd been interested in science fiction literature since around the beginning of junior high,

00:21.160 --> 00:25.640
when I discovered that I didn't have all that many friends and there wasn't much else to do.

00:25.640 --> 00:30.740
And I was a ravenous reader and I read all the horror stories in the book, in the library,

00:30.800 --> 00:38.100
all the dog stories in the library and I didn't like mysteries and I didn't like romances and all that was left was science fiction.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.740
So I grudgingly took science fiction down off the shelf and started.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.200
And I've been hooked ever since.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.980
It was kind of like the most wonderful thing I'd ever discovered,

00:46.620 --> 00:50.700
a genre of literature where your imagination can run completely wild.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.700
And for a long time I knew absolutely nothing about fandom.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.020
And then I discovered Star Trek.

00:57.300 --> 01:01.220
Interestingly enough, my stepfather was watching it and I happened to sit down one evening

01:01.220 --> 01:06.100
and I was hooked from then on because it was a wonderful world of the future

01:06.100 --> 01:08.600
where all kinds of imaginative things were happening.

01:08.820 --> 01:13.580
But more importantly, it was still a world about people and it was people conquering the future

01:13.580 --> 01:16.360
and conquering problems and most of all conquering themselves.

01:16.620 --> 01:22.440
And at the time, that was my biggest problem, was trying to learn how to deal with myself and deal with the people around me.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.820
So I became an avid Trekkie and I still didn't know about fandom.

01:26.700 --> 01:32.100
But one day after Star Trek, there was a big advertisement for a Star Trek convention in Dallas

01:32.620 --> 01:36.500
and it was going to have some of the stars there and everything and I'd never heard of such a thing.

01:36.940 --> 01:44.380
But it sounded like a lot of fun so we went down and then I ran into nearly 1,500 to 2,000 fans

01:44.380 --> 01:49.980
who also liked Star Trek, who also had a reason for coming to science fiction and fantasy

01:49.980 --> 01:54.120
and had been touched by Star Trek because of this feeling they had.

01:54.780 --> 01:57.500
And all of a sudden I had a family and a place to belong.

01:57.880 --> 02:01.980
And I've been an avid fan ever since going to as many conventions as I could.

02:02.420 --> 02:05.640
And one aspect of this convention was costuming.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.380
And I'd always been sort of interested in theater and that sort of thing but never really involved.

02:10.980 --> 02:14.540
But here were all these people who weren't really in the theater and weren't performers

02:14.540 --> 02:18.540
but they had all these wonderful costumes and were going up and doing the masquerades.

02:18.540 --> 02:22.160
The next time they had a convention I was ready and I had my first costume.

02:22.640 --> 02:27.820
It was a very poorly made mirror, mirror costume from the Star Trek episode, Mirror, Mirror.

02:29.220 --> 02:33.140
But it was a beginning and it was something and all of a sudden I was involved

02:33.140 --> 02:39.640
and I had a part in a world where in my day life I didn't have much of anything that I really belonged to.

02:40.460 --> 02:44.700
And through fandom and science fiction and belonging to that world,

02:44.700 --> 02:49.140
I eventually learned how to belong in a normal world again.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.160
And basically it changed my entire life.

02:52.720 --> 02:57.540
I actually even became popular in high school which at the time that I started in fandom

02:57.540 --> 03:00.440
I would have thought that popularity was something I would never see.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.180
And then it grew from there.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.960
I became a theater and drama major at UTA.

03:06.640 --> 03:10.220
And I now work as a professional singer and performer

03:10.220 --> 03:14.460
and do a lot of costuming with that job and freelance costuming.

03:14.740 --> 03:21.340
But my first love is still making characters come alive on the stage at science fiction and fantasy conventions.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.660
Because I think that what I was searching for at the time was a reality that I could fit into

03:26.660 --> 03:28.900
and I think that's what the other fans are searching for.

03:29.340 --> 03:33.220
And the masquerade gives me a chance to make that dream become a reality.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.840
Give us a specific example of bringing a character to life.

03:38.840 --> 03:44.860
Alright, for example, one of our most successful costume skits that we designed

03:44.860 --> 03:50.000
and I had some other people with me at the time, we went to World Con in Boston

03:50.960 --> 03:57.120
and we had a young fellow who was a good friend of mine and my little sister did a Star Wars skit together.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.440
But what they did was the lights darkened and the Star Wars theme came up.

04:02.440 --> 04:08.580
Then all of a sudden Luke Skywalker came flying through the air doing somersaults onto the stage,

04:09.060 --> 04:16.340
stopped and did a one-handed handstand very precariously balancing using the force to hold him up.

04:16.540 --> 04:22.120
And then Yoda came slowly onto stage, nodding wisely and instructing him on the use of the force.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.340
He didn't get it right the first time, then he tried again the second time

04:25.340 --> 04:30.860
and finally succeeded with a perfect one-handed handstand balancing with the use of the force.

04:30.860 --> 04:36.780
And then leapt up, did a couple more flying leaps and somersaults in the middle of the air across the stage and left,

04:37.280 --> 04:42.640
standing ovation by 9,000 screaming people who for them Star Wars was alive.

04:43.720 --> 04:50.360
And that particular skit that was one that I designed and my little sister and boyfriend at the time took part in

04:50.360 --> 04:54.920
won the first prize for best presentation at a World Con.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.960
And there were about 150 entrants in that masquerade.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.780
But this was special because all of a sudden their characters were alive.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Another one that I have done has been extremely.

05:06.440 --> 05:11.260
Wait a second. Back up and give us the kind of a genesis of how you put this all together.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.520
Like how the costume, what, what, how the costumes got, how the idea for the action,

05:17.920 --> 05:23.560
the little plot storyline that you had. Give us a little rendition of how that came together.

05:24.020 --> 05:29.900
Okay, the way that skit came together is that we were sitting around and we wanted to go to World Con.

05:30.020 --> 05:34.700
Of course, everyone wanted to take part in the masquerade because it's kind of your chance to be a star, as it were.

05:35.140 --> 05:40.200
And the audiences at World Con are so large that it's probably the largest audience you will ever have, even if you do Broadway.

05:41.720 --> 05:48.600
And my little sister was very interested in performing, but she only likes to perform behind a mask because that way she's more secure.

05:48.600 --> 05:57.460
And my boyfriend was a gymnast. And so we decided we needed to do something to do a useful thing with his gymnastic skills.

05:58.500 --> 06:04.560
And just recently we'd been asked by a theater to come and do a Star Wars performance for their opening of Empire.

06:05.040 --> 06:11.860
And so we went and did the opening and built him a Luke Skywalker outfit for the opening.

06:11.860 --> 06:19.060
And when he was there, he was playing around and discovered that he could do most of the force stunts just by virtue of his gymnastic training.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.700
Because he'd been like fifth in the state in gymnastics.

06:23.680 --> 06:30.800
And then my little sister started playing around and rehearsing and working on looking like Yoda and walking like Yoda and having the mannerisms.

06:31.240 --> 06:38.600
And it dawned on me that since we had a special talent here, that we could make use of that to bring this special thing to fans

06:38.600 --> 06:42.860
who had probably never dreamed of the fact that the force could be made to come alive.

06:43.580 --> 06:51.000
And if we hadn't had a gymnast, we could have figured out a way to do it with wires and stuff, but it was that much more special because it was real and live.

06:51.820 --> 06:54.040
And that was how that particular act came together.

06:54.840 --> 06:59.460
Now I also have another one that has been extremely successful. It's called Morgan Le Fay.

06:59.460 --> 07:08.300
And the character basically I was sitting around trying to think of what is a really way out character that's not all that well known,

07:08.600 --> 07:12.840
but that could command the stage and make that same kind of reality come about.

07:13.280 --> 07:21.440
And it occurred to me that very little has been done with the saucerist Morgan Le Fay, who's from the Arthurian legend and who was the one that eventually defeated Merlin.

07:21.440 --> 07:31.360
And I thought if I can make this character do a spell on stage so that the audience really believes it, that that would be an excellent kind of costume to do.

07:32.160 --> 07:42.280
So I designed the costume and of course it's different than designing a costume for a movie character or a television character because it was completely up to my imagination what I wanted to do with it.

07:42.280 --> 07:58.480
So I used a lot of reds and blacks and lots of gold to create a total effect of color but somber, evil color and made a very large headdress with lots of sparkles on it to catch the light.

07:58.920 --> 08:08.360
And designed it in such a way so that it would give the impression of an evil saucerist who had a lot of power and was a ruler in her own right.

08:08.360 --> 08:15.380
And designed the cloak so that it would actually fold out into a half circle so that it would look like bat wings on the back.

08:15.660 --> 08:21.880
The costume was beautiful but that's not enough. The next thing I did was I wanted to design something for her to do.

08:22.400 --> 08:32.180
So I wrote a spell. I decided that she would probably be pissed at someone because she's usually angry at someone most of the time and was famous for destroying people and things.

08:32.180 --> 08:40.740
So I wrote a spell wherein she was summoning the spirits of darkness who came and gathered around her and then she sends them off to go destroy all her enemies.

08:42.300 --> 08:55.980
Which is nice but again that wasn't enough. So the next thing I did is I started listening to albums trying to find some music that would summon the mood because I wanted a very somber, evil mood sort of like the building of a thunderstorm.

08:55.980 --> 09:09.100
And I finally came across in the album Lion in Winter a very somber, evil sounding piece of music which sounded very much like a thunderstorm building coming into the foreground and then receding.

09:09.660 --> 09:22.760
And then I worked the spell so that it would work exactly around the crescendos. And then I added a soundtrack record which had thunder and lightning on it and went into my handy dandy little stereo set in the middle of the living room.

09:22.760 --> 09:34.920
I bought a bunch of patch chords from Radio Shack so that the room looked like Spaghetti'sville and patched it all together and using a normal hand mic and a reverb effect from the speakers being on at the same time as the recording

09:34.920 --> 09:46.880
managed to get an evil reverberating sound to the voice, lightning and thunder in the background, this awesome evil music building and flowing and a high climax and then fading out in the distance.

09:46.880 --> 09:58.040
So I had a wonderful soundtrack and if the mic failed I'd still be fine because I had it all on tape. The next thing I did was I needed something else, something special that would still make it believable.

09:58.180 --> 10:12.760
Now the sound was there and the sight was there but it needed something extra. So I went down to the Magic Store and bought a special Magic Gizmo and some flash paper and the way the actual skit came off was something like this.

10:12.760 --> 10:26.640
The stage would darken and then you'd see a red glow moving up onto the stage and you'd see just the outline of this bizarre golden mask and headdress and a red garbed woman holding the red globe.

10:27.240 --> 10:39.600
Then the music starts and starts to build and all of a sudden the spell starts and then suddenly there's a burst of flame from the red globe and then as the spell builds and she starts summoning the darkness the room gets darker for a moment

10:39.600 --> 10:56.620
and then there's another burst of flame and the room starts to lighten just a little bit and the spell builds and builds until finally she banishes the light from her and says darkness be gone and then blasts this huge shot of fire, blue flame straight up into the sky and the darkness is gone

10:56.620 --> 11:07.340
and then she tells you that she is Morgan Le Fay and then demonstrates the costume and shows the wide wings of the bat and slowly walks off as the thunder fades into the distance.

11:08.000 --> 11:32.600
Again, I got a standing ovation. The costume has never not won a prize. It has always been first and second everywhere I've taken it and there are better costumes but it comes to life and that's what the people are looking for is a way to bring their fantasies and their dreams into reality so they can touch them so it's something they can really have a tangible experience from.

11:33.400 --> 11:43.360
I've seen you do your thing before and it's not just walking up and showing the costume, striking a pose and leaving you have a performance that you do.

11:43.520 --> 11:43.920
Exactly.

11:49.980 --> 11:54.100
Just to re-enerate a little bit of why you decided to add that extra dimension.

11:54.100 --> 12:15.180
Well, I've seen a lot of masquerades and when I started the thing was that everyone walked up there, turned around and walked off and it was nice but after about the 50th person it can get real boring and since the masquerade was designed with an audience in mind it seemed to me that there should be something more entertaining for them

12:15.180 --> 12:31.160
and some people were doing little bitty skits and flourishes if they had a sword and stuff like that but it still wasn't enough. It was still Johnny in a costume trying to show off his sword or every now and then there would be a nice skit that was really funny and that was the high point.

12:31.160 --> 12:42.180
But very few high points for a lot of people going through the line and showing their costumes and I started thinking about well what is a masquerade really supposed to be? What is it all about?

12:42.620 --> 12:51.960
And also there was the fact that although I'm not a bad seamstress, neither am I equipped to go work for Warner Brothers Studios or something like that.

12:52.600 --> 13:01.580
And it occurred to me that if I was going to win and if I was going to capture these people's imagination I'd do something more than walk up there with a brilliant costume, turn around and walk off.

13:02.120 --> 13:09.440
And also I think part of it's the actress in me. If I'm going to do something and play like I'm a character, I want to play like I'm really that character.

13:09.440 --> 13:22.440
I want to feel it and be it and make it as real as possible because it's more fun for me. If I'm going to be Princess Leah I'd like to have a chance to really feel like I'm Princess Leah out to save the Rebel Alliance or whatever.

13:23.540 --> 13:33.640
And it seemed like that was what was lacking. The people were trying for that, they wanted to do that, they wouldn't have built the costume if they didn't want for a minute to feel like they were that hero or villain or whatever.

13:34.100 --> 13:38.640
But the extra touches weren't there and so I decided that that would be a good thing to do.

13:39.060 --> 13:43.020
And when I got to WorldCon I discovered that that was what was preferred.

13:43.920 --> 13:54.500
And as a matter of fact now most WorldCon costumes are designed with the idea of trying to bring that character to life in some way and make a show of it even if it's only a minute long.

13:54.620 --> 13:58.560
Because most of them it's good not to do it over a minute or a minute and a half.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.440
But even in a minute or a minute and a half you can bring it to life.

14:01.440 --> 14:14.240
And when I choose a character to do, when I'm trying to decide what I'm going to do for the next costume, the first question I ask is what is it about this character that is special that will bring this character to life?

14:14.500 --> 14:19.420
What can I do to make this character stand out so it's not just a costume on a stage?

14:19.860 --> 14:25.400
And if the answer is nothing, if there's nothing special about that character, that costume, I won't do it.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.380
Okay.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.660
There is costuming for movie characters and for literary characters.

14:39.520 --> 14:43.720
Which one is more challenging? I would assume it would be the literary characters.

14:44.500 --> 14:49.840
But what are the different challenges is it doing a movie character versus a written character?

14:49.840 --> 14:55.440
Well, of course there are the two kinds like you mentioned, the media and the literary.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.740
Actually, it depends.

14:58.760 --> 15:06.300
I think one of my greatest challenges was recreating the characters from Heavy Metal, which I did last year.

15:06.660 --> 15:15.940
Because the costumes were designed on animated figures and I was trying to recreate them onto live action figures exact in detail.

15:15.940 --> 15:26.280
And for me, it is almost harder to do an exact detailed replica of an existing costume than to just be able to let my imagination go wild and do whatever.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.480
And the reason for that is if you get it wrong, they're going to know.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.480
Where if you're doing a costume from your imagination, you can make it very elaborate.

15:33.660 --> 15:38.600
But if something doesn't work, you can say, oh well, I didn't like that effect anyway, let's do something different.

15:39.080 --> 15:44.440
It takes more time and you have to put a lot more detail onto an imaginary costume.

15:44.440 --> 15:49.780
But it takes an extreme amount of discipline and creativity to do an exact reproduction.

15:51.320 --> 15:58.520
Unfortunately, the exact reproductions usually do the least winning unless you've got something special to add to them.

15:58.680 --> 16:03.280
Because the inspiration for the costumes is available to anyone.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.640
You know, go to the movies, go to TV, you can see the costumes.

16:06.640 --> 16:16.680
And so we tend to have an overrun of Starfleet uniforms and Jawas and Stormtroopers and I remember one masquerade.

16:16.800 --> 16:22.660
We had seven Lahan solos and five Luke Skywalker's and six Princess Leia's.

16:23.020 --> 16:26.600
Wookiees are a little harder, but there have been two of them on occasion.

16:27.200 --> 16:34.960
But yet they're very challenging to do to get them right and a lot of times you can spot that one's not quite right, but they don't do the most winning.

16:34.960 --> 16:40.900
So usually when I do a media costume, it's not necessarily aimed for the masquerade.

16:41.160 --> 16:45.940
It's usually aimed for something to bring the convention itself to life by wearing around the halls.

16:46.300 --> 16:49.660
The exception being Tarna, we had a show we could put on with Tarna.

16:49.940 --> 16:58.420
We recreated part of the movie on stage and we're able to do it convincingly in such a way again as to bring the character to life.

16:58.500 --> 17:03.500
But if I couldn't have done that, I would have never put the character on the stage just to show off the costume.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.480
Even though it was actually harder to build than Morgana, which was an imaginary costume.

17:08.400 --> 17:16.580
I'm glad you brought that up about parading through the halls before the main show, but I want to get on that.

17:16.760 --> 17:30.080
But are there any authors who, because of the way they write or the way they describe things, who you tend to gravitate toward when you do characters?

17:30.080 --> 17:41.020
Actually, what I prefer to do when I'm doing a literary character is I prefer to pick a character that has the least description about what they are and the most potential.

17:41.400 --> 17:45.500
Gods and goddesses are wonderful. Spirits are wonderful.

17:46.320 --> 17:52.480
Things that you really can't imagine is belonging in the real world or the best things when you're doing an imaginary costume.

17:52.480 --> 18:03.920
For example, if you're doing a snow spirit, you can go absolutely crazy on cloaks and full-spread backdrops and headdresses that reach from here to heaven and back.

18:04.320 --> 18:08.420
And that kind of thing that are absolutely ridiculous for a real person to be wearing around the streets.

18:08.700 --> 18:15.540
But if you're talking about a mythical being or a creature or spirit, you can go absolutely hog wild and they look the best on stage.

18:15.540 --> 18:24.120
A set that we're working on right now, as a matter of fact, we're doing a series called The Three Fates and we're doing birth, death and destiny.

18:24.880 --> 18:30.300
And again, these are spirits. They're characters that don't have any actual human parameters.

18:30.600 --> 18:38.240
So we can go absolutely nuts on the costume as far as just getting the feeling across and doing anything we want to make something super flamboyant.

18:38.240 --> 18:51.180
It's much harder to do an actual real living character because again, you have to deal with something that's possible that a person would actually wear around and still make it beautiful enough and interesting enough that it takes over the stage.

18:51.380 --> 18:58.300
And if you don't have the skid or the characterization to go with it, no matter what you do or how well you do it, it's not going to cut it.

19:02.280 --> 19:10.920
Okay, what about the wearing of the costumes during the con? You may not wear the same costume on stage that you do down the hall.

19:10.920 --> 19:19.300
Yeah, I've noticed. I've noticed they're at the cons. They're the mass grade costumes and then they're the everyday wear...

19:20.520 --> 19:21.980
Not stating as well.

19:21.980 --> 19:22.220
Kind of the roll.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.900
The everyday costume that once you wear during the con.

19:24.900 --> 19:28.480
Exactly, exactly. Hall costumes versus stage costumes.

19:28.660 --> 19:28.900
What's the difference?

19:29.260 --> 19:35.900
The difference is that a hall costume, for example Starfleet uniforms are wonderful hall costumes.

19:36.100 --> 19:42.160
They're terrible on the stage unless you've written a player's skit to go with them and which is the player's skit that does the winning, not the costume.

19:42.160 --> 19:51.480
But they're wonderful for hall costumes because you can really be from the enterprise down on shore leave looking through a bazaar or going to lectures or whatever.

19:51.900 --> 19:57.580
And there's a lot of the let's pretend we're bringing it to life in the everyday kind of syndrome with real people.

19:57.760 --> 20:04.400
And this is where you can sink your teeth into a live character because this is where the live character type of outfits work so well.

20:04.400 --> 20:16.200
You can be Conan or his lady or you can be a stormtrooper or Luke and Han and Leia and get into the everyday let's pretend aspect of it.

20:16.460 --> 20:20.200
Where these characters would die on stage unless you have something special.

20:20.340 --> 20:22.520
You don't have to be able to do anything to wear a hall costume.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.660
And yet at the same time you can have a lot of fun.

20:25.820 --> 20:29.240
It's fun for other people because it brings the convention to life.

20:29.240 --> 20:35.020
Hey, they came here to get into science fiction and fantasy and wow, look, there's Han Solo right over there.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.040
All of a sudden it's special for them.

20:37.480 --> 20:41.980
And masqueraders and hall costumers are doing a service actually.

20:42.180 --> 20:47.840
They're making fun for themselves because they can pretend but they're making fun for everyone else because they're making it come alive.

20:48.380 --> 20:56.760
And that's why conventions are as popular as they are now anyway is because the fans are looking for a way to bring the whole thing out to make it more real.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.220
To touch the authors that make this magic.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.700
To touch the artists that create the magic.

21:01.960 --> 21:06.360
To make it all something more tangible than just what they see in a book.

21:07.020 --> 21:09.520
And the hall costumes are absolutely essential for that.

21:09.940 --> 21:16.220
And then again we have a different kind of hall costume which is the medieval society costume and none of these are stage costumes.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.000
They never are.

21:17.340 --> 21:20.740
Most of them are much better made than stage costumes because they're clothes.

21:20.740 --> 21:28.500
And the medieval society usually shows up at conventions to promote their club and to bring a touch of the fantasy element into it.

21:28.580 --> 21:33.880
And bring the medieval ages to life and so forth.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.540
And they have a completely different kind of costume but again it's a hall costume.

21:39.040 --> 21:44.440
By the medieval society are you speaking to the society for creative and agronism or some other?

21:44.440 --> 21:45.780
There are several.

21:46.700 --> 21:53.000
There is the society for creative and agronisms which is most prevalent here in the Southwest and it's nationwide.

21:53.740 --> 21:55.720
But down here it's the only one we have.

21:56.180 --> 22:01.640
There also are the Marklanders which are a slightly different variation on the same kind of theme.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.900
I believe there are one or two others but those are the two major ones.

22:06.900 --> 22:13.280
So there's more than one kind of medieval society but the major one, the largest one is the society for creative and agronisms.

22:14.340 --> 22:21.240
And they recreate all aspects of medieval life but since fantasy is such a big part of the science fiction and fantasy genre

22:21.240 --> 22:26.940
and since most fantasies are based on a medieval way of life they fit right in to the convention scene.

22:28.020 --> 22:30.260
Which kind of costumes are more essential to work on?

22:30.520 --> 22:33.960
Science fiction type of costume or a fantasy costume?

22:35.920 --> 22:37.460
Actually it really depends.

22:39.340 --> 22:44.060
They're all fun to work on if you've got a good idea and some place to go with it.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.560
And it doesn't matter whether they're science fiction or fantasy.

22:47.860 --> 22:56.320
Most of the better costumes are fantasy simply because fantasy is so open-ended that you can go really berserk on what you're doing with it.

22:56.540 --> 23:01.200
But I have seen some really phenomenal ideas to do for science fiction costumes as well.

23:01.200 --> 23:09.200
The problem with science fiction is that most of it is technical and nuts and bolts and spacesuits and things like that.

23:09.380 --> 23:12.620
And you have to really reach to find a creative way to do something different.

23:12.740 --> 23:18.700
But I have seen some really phenomenal things done with robotics and weaponry and nuts and bolts things.

23:19.080 --> 23:24.620
I prefer the fantasy type things because you don't have any limitations.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.660
You don't have to make it look like it could work.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.800
You can just go bananas on it.

23:28.800 --> 23:37.360
But then again, McCaffrey has turned dragons into a science fiction character, which were once totally fantasy.

23:37.820 --> 23:38.560
So who can say?

23:38.960 --> 23:44.800
They're both equally challenging if you just have the right idea and an interesting enough idea to make it challenging.

23:46.530 --> 23:53.780
At a masquerade, is there an error of competition or do people help each other and admire each other?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.340
It's kind of one big happy family.

23:55.340 --> 23:58.600
It depends where you are, just like any other competition.

23:58.840 --> 23:59.980
It depends who's involved.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.500
I have been in masquerades where it was tooth and nail and they were out for blood.

24:04.940 --> 24:09.580
And I've been in masquerades where it was one big happy family and everybody was helping everybody else.

24:09.820 --> 24:14.740
And they were glad when the best costume won and whoever won and it didn't matter.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.460
So it really depends on where you are.

24:18.360 --> 24:25.320
At WorldCon, a lot of times in the masters category, it's tooth and nail simply because these people are very, very good.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.700
They're good at what they do and they really want to win because they've been at it for so long.

24:30.540 --> 24:37.940
But at a small local convention, for example, the StarCon in Lubbock, it's very small, very friendly.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.260
Everybody helps everybody.

24:39.800 --> 24:47.680
For example, I'm probably going to be one of the judges and I've already loaned out about six things out of my costume wardrobe to help people out with their costumes.

24:47.980 --> 24:50.680
You know, and don't feel anything about doing it.

24:50.680 --> 24:56.320
I think that's the way where at a much larger convention where it was much more serious, I wouldn't do that because some people might be offended.

24:57.360 --> 25:07.260
But we try to keep it a happy family and I've seen a lot less of the blood feud type masquerades than I have of the happy family type masquerades.

25:07.620 --> 25:12.520
Because usually everybody's there for a good time and they're all there for the same purpose to bring it to life.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.980
And as long as everybody's after the same thing, it's all fun.

25:17.380 --> 25:26.640
The only major problems that we have with masquerades is a lot of conventions slough them off as, oh well, we have to do this and they really don't know what they're doing.

25:26.820 --> 25:35.720
And the biggest tragedies are when the contestants are mistreated by the convention because the convention really doesn't care about the contestants and what they're doing.

25:37.180 --> 25:42.040
And they really don't care if it's well run and the masquerades just kind of an afterthought.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.520
And that's the only time I've seen any real problems.

25:47.180 --> 25:50.700
Because most of these people have worked quite a while to put their...

25:50.700 --> 26:01.940
A good example, which is a good example of a lot of things going wrong with the convention, was the ultimate fantasy and Houston convention which was held in Houston just recently.

26:02.300 --> 26:06.020
It's already gotten in a lot of the magazines for the fiasco with the ultimate fantasy.

26:06.020 --> 26:13.460
But a little known tragedy that people don't know about is at one time it was scheduled that there was to be a masquerade.

26:14.280 --> 26:19.280
And we went and there were a lot of really wonderful costumes that showed up.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.760
And I mean costumes that could have won on a regional level.

26:24.540 --> 26:28.480
And what turned out is there almost wasn't a masquerade at all.

26:28.820 --> 26:29.980
It was kind of a joke.

26:29.980 --> 26:37.540
There was no official judges. Fortunately by the good graces of Richard Penny, who with his wife Wendy, they do the ElfQuest books.

26:37.840 --> 26:44.760
He showed up, got a couple other people to join with him and they went ahead and did judging and announced a winner and so forth.

26:45.080 --> 26:52.780
But the convention itself had sort of washed its hands of the whole thing and was just going to leave the masquerader standing there with a rock band playing in the background.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.440
When what they'd come to do was the masquerade, not dancing costume.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.940
You can do that on Halloween at any local disco.

27:00.040 --> 27:06.220
But it worked out because again the pros worked with the costumers to try and make it work.

27:06.360 --> 27:13.960
And although there were no prizes, at least there was a costume contest and there was an award and people didn't feel quite so cheated.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.840
But the con had just kind of sloughed it off.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.500
I don't want to open a can of worms.

27:22.580 --> 27:29.080
But there is a controversy about weapons and the costumers. Is that just kind of a mini bruhaha?

27:29.360 --> 27:35.560
Actually there is a big deal about weapons but it generally has nothing to do with the masquerade.

27:36.300 --> 27:42.200
Because unless a masquerade is very poorly run, they usually have enough space where you can do pretty well anything you want.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.500
If you kill yourself on stage, that's your tough luck.

27:45.080 --> 27:56.000
It's a good idea when using weapons, if you're going to do anything with a weapon for God's sake, choreograph it until you know absolutely perfectly what you're doing before you ever get up on stage and flourish a weapon.

27:56.600 --> 28:02.420
The weapons bruhaha is mainly over weapons being worn on costumes in the halls.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.920
Now we don't have as much a problem with it here in the Southwest as they do other places.

28:07.120 --> 28:10.280
But the flak that's coming down from other places has reached here.

28:10.820 --> 28:18.720
Basically what happens is you have a lot of kids who get ahold of a sword and they throw it on their Conan costume and they draw it in the halls and so forth.

28:19.540 --> 28:31.540
We've managed to stop most of that because there are simple rules of courtesy which can be observed in weapons or strictly, most of us observe weapons as strictly a piece of jewelry that is worn with the costume to complete it.

28:31.540 --> 28:39.760
And if you look at it that way, it's very safe and you never draw it in public except with permission by all around and you certainly never do duels in the hallway.

28:40.280 --> 28:46.440
Dules are strictly for the masquerade or join a society like the creative and acronyms where you can fight if you really want to fight.

28:47.880 --> 29:00.680
And a lot of conventions rather than ban them have instead instituted a policy that if you draw it where you're not supposed to or if you threaten some with it where you're not supposed to, you lose it for the duration of the convention.

29:00.680 --> 29:09.760
And the ones who have done that and who have let groups like the society enforce their rules who have a very strict code of honor concerning weapons haven't had any problem.

29:10.320 --> 29:16.900
And the main problem isn't with the normal fans and the people who do costuming and who are serious about what they do.

29:17.180 --> 29:25.820
The main problem is with the kids or the people off the street who think weapons are a neat fun toy and oh boy now we can sword fight because we're at a convention.

29:25.820 --> 29:29.560
Or oh boy now we can shoot somebody with a water pistol because we're at a convention.

29:29.940 --> 29:33.180
It's not allowed anywhere else and it's not allowed at a convention either.

29:33.700 --> 29:39.100
Conventioning does not give you an excuse to do these kind of bad things and it's a few who are trying to ruin it for the many.

29:39.780 --> 29:42.060
And that's basically all the weapons thing is.

29:42.180 --> 29:47.460
The best weapons policy I've seen for a major convention is what Chicago had.

29:47.580 --> 29:50.840
I did not attend Chicago but I did read their weapons policy.

29:50.840 --> 30:02.380
And basically it stated keep your blade if you're wearing a blade keep it sheathed at all times unless you were showing the blade in which case you have to do it in a basically secluded spot.

30:02.620 --> 30:05.800
Make sure there's no one around who could be startled by your drawing the blade.

30:06.080 --> 30:16.480
Make sure they know you're doing it and strictly to show not in a defense or attack position but in a showing position where it could not possibly be construed as a threat.

30:17.380 --> 30:22.000
Even then the con had the right if they thought you were drawing it in a threatening manner to confiscate it.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.820
No weapons that shot things.

30:24.960 --> 30:25.800
No water guns.

30:25.960 --> 30:26.980
No frisbee guns.

30:27.120 --> 30:32.300
Nothing that shot any kind of actual substance even if it was just water.

30:33.200 --> 30:40.300
Nothing that looked like a real gun because there have been occasions when people have brought real weapons into a hotel.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.640
Even if they had nothing to do with the convention it caused problems.

30:43.640 --> 30:47.500
So no replicas that looked like real guns even if it does go with the costume.

30:48.900 --> 30:55.060
And courtesy about how you wear them so that you don't slam into people's legs because your sword stuck out behind you.

30:55.740 --> 30:58.000
And no live-streaming.
