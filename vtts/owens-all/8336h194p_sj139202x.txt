How do I make it?

She bought him a pair of the very best socks and the soldier put them on.

Must know and speak the truth.
You left me when my heart was sore.
No voice can e'er excuse me.
Farewell, I think I love you again.
As friend to friend, I bid you adieu.
And guide you through life's troubled way 
To where the skies are always clear.
