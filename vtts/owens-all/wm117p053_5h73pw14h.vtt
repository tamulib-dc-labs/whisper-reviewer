00:01.955 --> 00:07.040
I heard the voice of Jesus saying, come unto me and rest.

00:09.202 --> 00:26.460
I am the man of Jesus.

00:26.812 --> 00:46.406
I can't find you here.

00:46.426 --> 00:50.473
I can't find you.

00:51.787 --> 00:53.790
Lie down, I wear it one.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.793
Lie down, I head upon my breast.

00:56.174 --> 01:02.283
Lie down.

01:07.031 --> 01:08.754
Lie down.

01:12.820 --> 01:13.080
Lie down.

01:13.100 --> 01:19.971
Lie down.

01:25.199 --> 01:45.523
I came to Jesus as I was.

01:45.843 --> 01:52.371
Let's get it up a little bit.

01:55.287 --> 02:14.713
Jesus, man, I love you.

02:19.165 --> 02:20.189
.

02:20.209 --> 02:25.653
.

02:25.713 --> 02:25.733
.

02:32.598 --> 02:48.597
I found in him a resting place, and he hath made me glad that I'm here.

02:48.957 --> 02:57.627
Only the hymn through my life.
