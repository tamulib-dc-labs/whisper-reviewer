Oh, I couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Way down yonder by myself, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray.

Oh, I couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Way down yonder by myself, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray.

Hallelujah, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Life is over, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
In the kingdom, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
With the savior, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Oh Lord

Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Way down yonder by myself, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray.

Chilly water, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
In the Jordan, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray.
Crossing over, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
With the Savior, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Oh Lord

Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Way down yonder by myself, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray.

Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Couldn't hear nobody pray. 
Way down yonder by myself, 
Couldn't hear nobody pray.
