Lady Mary, an old English ballad.

He came from his palace grand 
And he came to my cottage door. 
His words were few but his looks 
They will linger forevermore. 
The smile in his sad dark eyes
More tender than words could be. 
But I was nothing to him 
Though he was the world to me. 

And there in the garden strolled 
All robed in fine satin and lace, 
Lady Mary so strange and cold
Who held in his heart no place. 
For he knew I would be his bride 
With a kiss for a lifetime fee.
But I was nothing to him, 
Though he was the world to me.

Today in his palace grand, 
On a flower-strewn bed he lies, 
With his beautiful lids fast closed, 
Over his beautiful, sad, dark eyes.
Among the mourners who mourn, 
Why should I a mourner be?
For I was nothing to him 
Though he was the world to me. 
For I was nothing to him
Though he was the world to me.
