Number 62, The Parting Song, Sacred Harp.

00:41.375 --> 01:10.048
My Christian friends in land of love

01:10.298 --> 01:18.011
Whose heart is clean in June undone.

01:18.031 --> 01:28.830
There's friendship like the drawing air, Yet we must take the farming air.

01:29.097 --> 01:55.695
You're hopelessly, you're years and years You were delightful to my years Yet when I think that we must part You draw like sparks around my heart

01:56.165 --> 02:08.301
How sweet the heart, how fast the way, that we are meant to sing and pray.

02:10.804 --> 02:20.818
How lovely are you in the place where Jesus chose his house in praise.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.923
Oh, God, I say,

02:25.105 --> 02:37.080
With friends all night, And, Lord, it is my building night.

02:37.701 --> 02:48.514
But you can make me understand That we must take the fighting man.
