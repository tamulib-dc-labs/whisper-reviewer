Hurrah for Arkansas.

They say there is a stream 
Where crystal waters flow 
That'll cure a man's sick or well 
If he will only go.

We're coming, Arkansas, 
We're coming, Arkansas, 
Our four-horse teams will soon be seen
On the road to Arkansas. 

The roads are rough down there, 
And you will find it so, 
There's rocks and rills and rocks and stumps 
On the road to Arkansas. 

We're coming, Arkansas, 
We're coming, Arkansas, 
Our four-horse teams will soon be seen
In the hills of Arkansas. 

The men keep hounds down there 
And hunting is all they care 
The women they hoe and plow the corn 
While the men shoot turkey and deer.

Hurrah for Arkansas
Hurrah for Arkansas, 
You bet your boots we people get there 
Way down in Arkansas. 

The girls are clean, 
Clean, healthy and strong, 
They card and spin from dark morning till night,
And dance from night till day.

Hurrah for Arkansas,
hurrah for Arkansas,
You bet your boots we people get there 
Way down in Arkansas.

They raise their 'baccer patch, 
The women all smoke and chaw,
Eat hog and hominy and poke for greens 
Way down in Arkansas.

We're leaving Arkansas,
We're leaving Arkansas,
Our four-horse teams will never be seen 
In the hills of Arkansas.
