laude's Wife. 

“Will you marry me Ethel?” Leon said,
in the light dimming his handsome hair.
“Will you give me the one great wish of my life?
The joy of calling you mine, my wife? 

“I have not the gift of eloquent words 
No more than the merry twittering bird 
But my dear Ethel will tell the tale 
That my lips in speaking must always fail.”

And I thought of Leon in his humble home
His pride, his race, his wife, his own. 
Of his mother busy with the cares of life 
Waiting to welcome Leon's wife. 

And I thought of Claude in his handsome home 
His noble race, his handsome face, 
Of the dresses fine and jewels rare
That I as wife would surely wear. 

And all the blessings and goodies of my life 
Went out of my heart on this starry night 
And I answered no in spite of life's woe 
And Leon's left me alone, alone. 

“Heaven's curse rests on your head,”
Leon's dying mother said, 
and that curse has followed me 
overland and overseas. 

Thirty years I've been Claude’s wife 
Thirty years of toil and strife 
Thirty years of grief and sorrow 
Thirty weary years tomorrow.

On a distant battlefield 
With none to protect and none to shield 
Leon died with no kind hand 
To cheer him in that far-off land. 

On his breast they found my face 
Smiling in its girlish grace 
Under the velvet lining of blue
Until the last he still was through.
