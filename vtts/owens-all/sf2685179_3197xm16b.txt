God of our fathers, whose almighty hand
Leads forth in beauty all the starry band
Of shining worlds in splendor through the skies,
Our grateful songs before thy throne arise.

Thy love divine hath led us in the past,
In this free land by thee our lot is cast;
Be thou our ruler, guardian, guide and stay,
Thy word our law, thy paths our chosen way.

From warâ€™s alarms, from deadly pestilence,
Be thy strong arm our ever sure defense,
Thy true religious in our hearts increase,
Thy bounteous goodness nourish us in peace.
