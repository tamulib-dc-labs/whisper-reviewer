Of silver and gold.

Whiskey, you villain, 
You've been my downfall.
You kick me, you cuff me, 
But I love you before all.

Jack o’ diamonds, jack o’ diamonds, 
I know you of old.
You robbed my poor pockets 
Of silver and gold.

Whiskey, you villain, 
You've been my downfall.
You kicked me, you cuffed me, 
But I love you before all.
