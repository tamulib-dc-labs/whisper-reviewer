When the Saints Go Marching In, a Negro spiritual sung antiphonally by a leader and a chorus.

Oh, when the saints, oh, when the saints 
Go marching in, go marching in.
Oh, when the saints go marching in.
Oh, Lord, I want to be among that number.
When the saints go marching in.

Oh, when the sun, oh, when the sun 
Refused to shine, refused to shine,
Oh, when the sun refused to shine, 
Oh, Lord, I want to be among that number 
When the sun refused to shine. 

Oh, when the moon, oh, when the moon 
Is red with blood, is red with blood 
Oh, when the moon is red with blood
Oh, Lord, I want to be among that number 
When the moon is red with blood.
