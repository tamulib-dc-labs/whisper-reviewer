These bones gwine rise again.

Lord he made a garden fair,
These bones gwine rise again;
Made Marse Adam and put him there,
These bones gwine rise again.

Took a rib from Adam’s side,
These bones gwine rise again,
Made Miss Eve to be his bride,
These bones gwine rise again.

I knowed it, knowed it,
Indeed I knowed it, sister,
I knowed it, whe-e-e,
These bones gwine rise again.

Peaches, pears, bananas, and such,
These bones gwine rise again,
But that tree you mustn’t touch,
These bones gwine rise again.

I knowed it, knowed it,
Indeed I knowed it, sister,
I knowed it, whe-e-e,
These bones gwine rise again.

In that garden Satan slunk,
These bones gwine rise again,
At Miss Eve his eye he wunk,
These bones gwine rise again.

At that tree she took a pull,
These bones gwine rise again,
Then she filled her apron full,
These bones gwine rise again.

Next day when the Lord come down,
These bones gwine rise again,
At that pair how he did frown,
These bones gwine rise again.

I knowed it, knowed it,
Indeed I knowed it, sister,
I knowed it, whe-e-e,
These bones gwine rise again.

Get right out of this garden fair,
These bones gwine rise again,
You can’t find no rest nowhere,
These bones gwine rise again,
Earn your bread by the sweat of your brow,
These bones gwine rise again,
And I guess that’s what they’ve been doing now,
These bones gwine rise again.

I knowed it, knowed it,
Indeed I knowed it, sister,
I knowed it, whe-e-e,
These bones gwine rise again.
