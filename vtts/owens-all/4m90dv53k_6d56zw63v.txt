The Congo by Vachel Lindsay.

Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room,
Barrel-house kings with feet unstable,
Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table,
Pounded on the table,
Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom,
Hard as they were able,
Boom, boom, boom, 
With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom,
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom.
Then I saw the Congo creeping through the black.
Cutting through the jungle with a golden track, 
Along the riverbank 
A thousand miles, 
Tattooed cannibals danced in files, 
And "Blood" screamed the whistles and fifes of the warriors, 
And "Blood" screamed the skull-faced lean witch-doctors.
Whirl you the deadly voodoo rattle, 
Harry the uplands, 
Steal all the cattle.
Rattle-rattle, rattle-rattle, 
Bing. 
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom.
