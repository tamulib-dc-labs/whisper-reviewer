Little Fish played by Edgar Lynn.

Oh, I wish I was a little fish 
I would dive to the bottom of the sea 
And I'd dive and I'd dive to my true love's gate 
And I would not dive anymore. 

Oh, I can't stay here by myself 
Oh, I can't stay here by myself.
Oh I'd sit and I'd sing my sad little song 
And nobody cares for me.

Oh I wish I was a lonely dove. 
I would fly to the top of a tree. 
And I'd fly, and I'd fly, through my true love's gate 
And I would not fly anymore. 

Oh, I can't stay here by myself 
Oh, I can't stay here by myself.
Oh I'd sit and I'd sing my sad little song 
And nobody cares for me.
