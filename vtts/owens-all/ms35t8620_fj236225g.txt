In a distant land out west, 
I have a mother kind and fair.
That I treasure more than silver or gold.
And the song she used to sing, 
Happy praise and cheer would bring.
And my loving mother's voice has never grown old.

She was faithful, she was true, 
She was kind and loving too.
And I always wept wherever I would roam. 
But she prayed to God each day 
In his own appointed way
That he'd someday bring me safely to her home. 

Since I left my mother's home, 
Since I choose a part to roam
I miss her tender care from day to day.
I miss her loving voice, 
Always made my heart rejoice.
She would carry me as I journeyed on my way.

She was faithful, she was true, 
She was kind and loving too.
And I always wept wherever I would roam. 
But she prayed to God each day 
In his own appointed way
That he'd someday bring me safely to her home.
