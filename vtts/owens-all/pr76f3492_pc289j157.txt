Went out a-sparkin', I didn't know where to go, 
Went to a man's house down here below,
The children crying for bread and the old folks gone, 
The girls all mad and their heads not combed, 
The girls all mad and their heads not combed.

I sat and sparked till I got ashamed, 
And every once in a while they'd ask me my name, 
And every once in a while they'd ask me my name.

When they go to cook I'll tell you how they do, 
They build up the fire as high as your head, 
Scratch out the ashes and pile them on the bread, 
Scratch out the ashes and pile them on the bread.

They called me to dinner and I thought for to eat, 
The first thing I saw was a big chunk of meat 
Cooked half done and tough as a maul, 
An old ash cake baked bran and all, 
An old ash cake baked bran and all. 

One old knife and nary a fork, 
I sawed for an hour and couldn't make a mark, 
I sawed for an hour and couldn't make a mark.

Kept on sawing till I got it out of my plate,
One of the girls says, “You'd better wait,”
Kept on sawing till I got it on the floor,
Up with my foot and kicked it out the door,
Up with my foot and kicked it out the door.

Long come the old man with his double-barreled gun,
One of the girls says, “You'd better run,”
Stood and fought him as brave as a bear, 
Tangled my fingers in the old man's hair,
Tangled my fingers in the old man's hair.

When you go to church, I'll tell you what to wear.
An old cotton dress, and that's the very best.
An old lint sack, grease all around.
An old leather bonnet with a hole in the crown,
An old leather bonnet with a hole in the crown.
