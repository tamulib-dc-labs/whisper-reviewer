Emerald, Texas, March 4th, 1939.

Oh, Molly, oh, Molly, 
It's for your sake alone 
That I leave my old parents, 
My house and my home.

That I leave my old parents, 
You cause me to roam.
I'm a rebel soldier 
And Dixie's my home.

My foot’s in my stirrups, 
My bridle’s in my hand, 
I'm going to leave Molly, 
The fairest in the land. 

Her parents don't like me, 
They say I'm too poor. 
They say I'm unworthy 
To enter her door. 

They say I drink whiskey, 
My money's my own. 
And them that don't like me 
Can leave me alone.

I'll eat when I'm hungry.
I'll drink when I'm dry.
And when I get thirsty, 
I'll lay down and cry.

I'll build me a castle 
On yonder mountain high 
Where my true love can see me 
When she comes riding by.

Where my true love can see me 
And help me to mourn.
I'm a rebel soldier.
And Dixie's my home.

I'll get up in my saddle, 
My quirt in my hand.
I'll think of you, Molly, 
When in some distant land.

I'll think of you, Molly, 
You've caused me to roam.
I'm a rebel soldier, 
And Dixie's my home.

Beef steak when I'm hungry, 
Rye whiskey when I'm dry, 
Greenback when I'm hard-up 
And heaven when I die.

Rye whiskey, rye whiskey, 
Rye whiskey, I cry.
If you don't give me rye whiskey, 
I truly will die.

If the ocean was whiskey 
And I was a duck, 
I'd dive through the bottom 
And never come up.

But the ocean ain't whiskey 
And I ain't a duck, 
So I'll play Jack o’ diamonds 
And trust you my love.

Oh, whiskey, oh, brandy, 
I like you pretty well, 
You've killed all my kinfolks
And sent them to hell.

You've killed all my kinsfolks
On rock gut and rye
I guess you'll send me 
When I'm ready to die.
