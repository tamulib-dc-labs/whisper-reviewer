You got to move, you got to move,
You got to move, you got to move,
Oh when the Lord gets ready, you got to move.

You may be high, you may be low,
You may be rich, you may be poor,
Oh when the Lord gets ready, you got to move.

You got to move, you got to move,
You got to move, you got to move,
Oh when the Lord gets ready, you got to move.

You may have trials, and troubles too,
Mother and father to pray for you,
Oh when the Lord gets ready, you got to move.

You got to move, you got to move,
You got to move, you got to move,
Oh when the Lord gets ready, you got to move.

You may have friends, you may have foes,
You may have neighbors that may go,
Oh when the Lord gets ready, you got to move.

You got to move, you got to move,
You got to move, you got to move,
Oh when the Lord gets ready, you got to move.
