Traveling on, traveling on. 
I'm traveling off again...
Traveling on, traveling on. 
I'll reach my home someday.

Traveling on, traveling on. 
I'm traveling off again...
Traveling on, traveling on. 
I'll reach my home someday.

I am always contented as I travel on. 
I have lines of sunshine and the rain.
...and the wind it keeps...
But I'll keep on traveling...

Traveling on, traveling on. 
I'm traveling off again...
Traveling on, traveling on. 
I'll reach my home someday.

Traveling on, traveling on. 
I'm traveling off again...
Traveling on, traveling on. 
I'll reach my home someday.
