I married me a wife and I sent her to milk, 
Ti rissle ti row row row,
The old crazy thing, she didn't know how.

Ti rissle ti rassle
Ti how, oh, John Dobber,
Ti Willie Ti Wallie
Ti Rusty go cwaller
Ti nickety now now now. 

She churns her milk in dad's old boot,
Ti rissle ti row row row,
And for her dasher she uses her foot.

Ti rissle ti rassle
Ti how, oh, John Dobber,
Ti Willie Ti Wallie
Ti Rusty go cwaller
Ti nickety now now now. 

She takes up her butter in dad's old hat, 
Ti rissle ti row row row,
And for her paddle she uses her cat. 

Ti rissle ti rassle
Ti how, oh, John Dobber,
Ti Willie Ti Wallie
Ti Rusty go cwaller
Ti nickety now now now. 

She sweeps her floors but once a year, 
Ti rissle ti row row row,
And for her broom she uses her chair.

Ti rissle ti rassle
Ti how, oh, John Dobber,
Ti Willie Ti Wallie
Ti Rusty go cwaller
Ti nickety now now now.
