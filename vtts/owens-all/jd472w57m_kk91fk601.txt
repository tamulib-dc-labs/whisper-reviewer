Glory, glory, hallelujah 
When I lay my burdens down. 
Glory, glory, hallelujah
When I lay my burdens down.

I'm gonna walk and talk with Jesus 
When I lay my burden down. 
I'm gonna walk and talk with Jesus 
When I lay my burden down. 

I'm going home to live with Jesus 
When I lay my burden down.
I'm going home to live with Jesus 
When I lay my burden down.
