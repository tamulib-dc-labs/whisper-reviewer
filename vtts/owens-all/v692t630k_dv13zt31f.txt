Lord I Can't Stay Away.
I can't stay away.
I can't stay away.
I can't stay away.

Lord I Can't Stay Away.
I can't stay away.
I can't stay away.
I can't stay away.

Got to go to heaven to stand my trial. 
Got to go to heaven to stand my trial. 
Got to go to heaven to stand my trial. 
I can't stay away. 

Lord I Can't Stay Away.
I can't stay away.
I can't stay away.
I can't stay away.

Coming from the east.
Coming from the west.
Coming from the north.
Coming from the south.
Coming on a rainbow.
Coming on a cloud.
I can't stay away.

Lord I Can't Stay Away.
I can't stay away.
I can't stay away.
I can't stay away.
