Bye-bye, My Darling.

Bye-bye, my darling,
I must leave you,
One sweet kiss before I go,
I'll be back next Sunday night,
If I cannot come, I’ll write
Just a word or two to let my darling know.

He has teeth as white as pearls,
And such darling little curls,
And his name which I call o’er every day,
He's the joy of my life, and I hope to be his wife,
And these words which I'll never hear again.

Bye-bye, my darling, I must leave you 
One sweet kiss before I go.
I'll be back next Sunday night 
If I cannot come, I’ll write
Just a word or two to let my darling know.
