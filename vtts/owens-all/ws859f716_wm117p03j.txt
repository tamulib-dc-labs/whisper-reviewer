When my nights are lonesome, come to see me once in a while;
When my nights are lonesome, mama, come to see me once in a while;
I like to look in your face, baby, and I like to see you smile.

You're as sweet as sugar, mama, sweetest little thing I ever seen;
You're as sweet as sugar, mama, sweetest little thing I ever seen;
Oh, well, I love you, baby, I swear I can't treat you mean.

Let me hold you in my arms, I'll sit you in my rocking chair.
Let me hold you in my arms, I'll sit you in my rocking chair.
You got something I like, baby, and I swear every stuff is there.

My nights are so lonesome if I can’t have a look at your face;
My nights are so lonesome, baby, if I can’t have a look at your face;
Is that another man, baby, trying to take my place?

You’d be mean and evil, mama, it’s all coming home to you;
You’d be mean and evil, mama, it’s all coming home to you.
