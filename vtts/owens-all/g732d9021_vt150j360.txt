Pilgrim.

I am a poor pilgrim
A stranger traveling through this unfriendly world,
I heard of a city called Heaven,
I’m trying to make it in.

Sometimes I’m tossed...
Sometimes I knew not where to roam
I heard of a city called Heaven,
I’m striving to make it in.

My mother is gone on and left me in this world alone,
My father is still walking in sin,
My brother and sister...
