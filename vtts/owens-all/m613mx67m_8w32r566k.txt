Way down in West Virginia lived a girl named Nancy Brown.
You've never seen such beauty in city or in town.

Now Nancy and the deacon climbed the mountainside one day,
But Nancy didn't like just what the deacon had to say.

She came rolling down the mountain,

And she's just as pure as moonlight on the hill.

He took Nancy and his Chevy up those West Virginia hills.

Oh, she stayed up in the mountains, 
Yes, she stayed up in the mountains,
She stayed up in the mountains all the night,
She came home next morning early,
