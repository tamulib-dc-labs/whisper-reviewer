I saw an old crow sitting in the oak, 
Watchin' a tailor cutting out a cloak, 
And a colly milly dilly ky yo
Ay flay ro dill to kay ro 
Up jumped come along, colly milly dilly ky ro
Flay ro dill to men.

Me and my wife sprang to the house 
To make some cool blood pudding and a souce, 
And a colly milly dilly ky yo
Ay flay ro dill to kay ro
Up jumped come along, colly milly dilly ky yo.
Flay ro dill to men.
