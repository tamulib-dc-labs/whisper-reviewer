Michael Finnegan, a song which repeats as many stanzas as necessary.

There was no man named Michael Finnegan.
He grew whiskers on his chin again.
He cut them off, but they grew in again.
Poor old Michael Finnegan.

Same thing, second verse.

There was no man named Michael Finnegan.
He grew whiskers on his chin again.
Cut them off, but they grew in again.
Poor old Michael Finnegan.
