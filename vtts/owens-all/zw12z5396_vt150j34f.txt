Oh, you ought to saw my Lord 
When he was coming from Jericho
Passing through 
On his way to Jerusalem.

My Lord was tired from a long, long journey.
And on the way he did say that.
My Lord was tired and weak and weary.
While he was on his way to town.

Oh, you ought to saw my Lord 
When he was coming from Jericho
Passing through 
On his way to Jerusalem.

Oh, you ought to saw my Lord 
When he was coming from Jericho
Passing through 
On his way to Jerusalem.

â€¦

Oh, you ought to saw my Lord 
When he was coming from Jericho
Passing through 
On his way to Jerusalem.

Oh, you ought to saw my Lord 
When he was coming from Jericho
Passing through 
On his way to Jerusalem.
