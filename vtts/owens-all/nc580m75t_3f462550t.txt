She was standing by her window, 
As the breezes kissed her cheek. 
He had waited long in silence, 
Waited long for her to speak. 

Then at last she gave an answer 
As she raised her tear-filled eyes.
With such a look of anger 
That it filled him with surprise. 

“They tell me that you love another 
And that you never did love me. 
If these words be true, my darling, 
I'll forever set you free.”

“They are true my dear,” he answered, 
“True as shining stars above, 
When they told of I was innocent, 
There they told you of my love.

“Goodbye, darling, I must leave you 
On the streets just pass me by. 
Don't forget that I still love you 
For to save my life I die.”

God in heaven sent an angel 
To relieve her dreadful pain
Then she drifted on to heaven 
On an angel's snow-white wing. 

He was standing by her casket 
As he gazed into her face
Then he realized that he loved her. 
No one else could take her place.
