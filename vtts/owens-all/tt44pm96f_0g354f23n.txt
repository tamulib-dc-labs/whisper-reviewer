Where's the Crow is a song frequently sung in chain gang camps.

Now tell me where is the crow?
He's in the hickory tree.
Now tell me how do you know?
Cause he told me so.
Oh, where'd you get that mystery?
From the old black crow in the hickory tree.

Had a suit of combination underwear.
Keep out the frost and the chilly air.
Wore it six months without a saturation.
Couldn't pull it off cause I lost the combination.
Oh, where'd you get that mystery?
From the old black crow in the hickory tree.
