Through the years, I keep on toiling,
Toiling through the storm and rain,
Watching, praying, and waiting,
Till my Savior come again.

I am waiting, Lord, trusting in thy way,
Keep me from the path of sin,
Hide me in the blood, write my name above,
When the gates swing open, let me in.

Pray keeps me feeling the service,
It helps me on everything,
I've had many a triumph,
Someday I'll understand.

I am coming, Lord, trusting in thy way,
Keep me from the path of sin,
Hide me in the blood, write my name above,
When the gates swing open, let me in.

Teach me how to love my neighbor,
Teach me how to treat my friends,
Fill me with the Holy Spirit,
Keep me humble to the end.

Oh my Lord, I'm trusting in thy way,
Just keep me from the path of sin,
Hide me in the blood, write my name above,
When the gates swing open, let me in.

I'm tired of this load I'm carrying, 
I'm tired of this sinful world,
The angels in the kingdom begging, 
Let a weary soul come in.

I am coming, Lord, trusting in thy way,
Keep me from the path of sin,
Hide me in the blood,
