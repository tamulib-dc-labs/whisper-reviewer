Toiling, toiling 
Through the storms and rain.
Oh I’m passionately waiting 
Till the Savior calls my name.

I am praying, Lord, I'm trusting in thy word.
Keep me from the path of sin.
Hide me in thy love and write my name above. 
And when the gate swings open, I'll be walking in. 

Keep you fit for service. 
I'll help you on every hand.
I have to admit your trials, 
Though someday I'll understand.

I am praying, Lord, I'm trusting in thy word.
Keep me from the path of sin.
Hide me in thy love and write my name above. 
And when the gate swings open, I'll come walking in.

Teach me how to treat my neighbor, 
Lord, teach me how to love my friend.
Fill me with the Holy Spirit. 
Just keep me humble to the end.

I'm a burden, Lord, I’m trusting in thy word.
Keep me from the path of sin.
Hide me in thy love and write my name above. 
And when the gate swings open, I'm walking in.
