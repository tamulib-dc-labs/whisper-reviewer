I am on the battlefield for my Lord.
I am on the battlefield for my Lord. 
I promised him that I would serve him till I die. 
I am on the battlefield for my Lord. 

I was alone and idle. I was a sinner too.
I heard a voice from heaven saying what I could do.
I took my massive hand, and I joined the Christian band. 
I am on the battlefield for my Lord.

I am on the battlefield for my Lord.
I am on the battlefield for my Lord. 
I promised him that I would serve him till I die. 
I am on the battlefield for my Lord. 

I left my friends and kindred bound for the promised land.
The grace of God upon me, the Bible in my hand.
In distant lands I trod crying, “Sinner, won't you come to God?” 
I am on the battlefield for my Lord.

I am on the battlefield for my Lord.
I am on the battlefield for my Lord. 
I promised him that I would serve him till I die. 
I am on the battlefield for my Lord.
