Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home,
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home.

I am sometimes up, sometimes down,
Coming to carry me home,
But still my soul is heavenly bound,
Coming to carry me home.

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home,
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home.

If you get there I do,
Coming to carry me home,
Tell all of my friends I'm coming too,
Coming to carry me home.

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home,
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home.

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home,
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home.
