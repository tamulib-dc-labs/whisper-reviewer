Shine on, shine on, harvest moon up in the sky.
I ain't had no lovin' since April, January, June and July,
Snow time ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon.
Shine on, shine on harvest moon for me and my gal, bring it on.

I ain't had no loving since April, January, June, and July.
Snow time ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon.
Shine on, shine on, harvest moon for me and my gal.
