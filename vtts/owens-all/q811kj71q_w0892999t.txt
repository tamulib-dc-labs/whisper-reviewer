Carol Swain singing Put Your All on the Altar.

You have longed for sweet peace and for faith to increase,
You have earnestly, fervently prayed,
But you cannot have rest, or be perfectly blessed,
Until your all on the altar is laid.

Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
Your heart does the spirit control?
You can only be blessed, have a peace and sweet rest.
When you yield him your body and soul.

Oh, you never will know what the Lord will bestow
Of the blessings for which you have prayed, 
Till your body and soul he doth fully control, 
And your all on the altar is laid.
