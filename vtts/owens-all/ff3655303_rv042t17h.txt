This is Rolly Troodum, an old Farley ballad sung by May Kennedy McCord.

As I went out a-walking to breathe the pleasant air, 
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.
As I went out a-walking to breathe the pleasant air, 
I saw a lady talking to her daughter fair,
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.

“Now hush up, dear daughter, and stop your rapid tongue, 
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.
Now hush up, dear daughter, and stop your rapid tongue.
You're talking about marrying and you know you're all too young,
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.”

“Now hush up, dear mother, you know I'm a lady grown, 
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.
Now hush up, dear mother, you know I'm a lady grown, 
I’ve lived seventeen years and I’ve lived it all alone,
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.”

“Oh, if you were to marry, who would be your man?
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.
Oh, if you were to marry, who would be your man?”
“Hush up, mammy, for you know it's handsome Sam.
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.”

They've gone for the parson, the license for the fetch, 
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.
They've gone for the parson, the license for the fetch. 
And I'm going to marry before the sunset,
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.

“There's doctors and lawyers and men that follow the plow 
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.
There's doctors and lawyers and men that follow the plow. 
And I'm going to marry for the fidget’s on my now, 
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.”

“Oh, now my daughter's married and well for to do,
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.
Oh, now my daughter's married and well for to do,
So hop along, my jolly boys, I think I’ll marry too,
Rolly troodum troodum troodum rolly day.”
