This is a Jesse James ballad sung by May Kennedy McCord, June the 5th, 1939.

Jesse James, he was a man 
Who was known throughout the land.
For Jesse, he was bold and bad and brave.
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard 
Went and lay poor Jesse in his grave.

It was on a Friday night.
The moon was shining bright.
Robert Ford had been hiding in a cave.
He did eat of Jesse's bread and slept in Jesse's bed, 
But he went and laid poor Jesse in his grave.

Jesse had a wife that mourned him all her life.
The children, they were brave.
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard 
Went and laid poor Jesse in his grave.

It was Jesse's brother Frank 
That robbed the Gallatin bank 
And carried the money from the town.
It was in that very place, they held a mighty race 
And shot Captain Sheets to the ground.

Then they went to the station, 
Not very far from there, 
And there Frank and Jesse did the same.
And the agent on his knees, 
Delivered up the keys 
To the outlaws Frank and Jesse James.

Jesse had a wife that mourned him all her life.
The children, they were brave.
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard 
Went and laid poor Jesse in his grave.

How the people held their breath 
When they heard of Jesse's death 
And wondered how he ever come to die.
But it was a sneaking coward, 
The dirty Robert Ford, 
That shot Jesse James on the sly.

Jesse had a wife that mourned him all her life.
The children, they were brave.
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard 
Went and laid poor Jesse in his grave.

Jesse went to rest 
With his hands upon his breast.
The devil, he will look him in the face.
He was born one stormy day 
In the county of old Clay 
And came from a solitary race.

Jesse had a wife that mourned him all her life.
The children, they were brave.
But the dirty little coward that murdered Mr. Howard 
Went and laid poor Jesse in his grave.
