Cruel War. 

Dearest one do you remember 
When last we did meet? 
How you told me how you loved me 
Kneeling at my feet?

Oh, how proud you stood before me 
In your suit of gray, 
When you vowed for me your country 
Ever to be free. 

Weeping sad and lonely,
Sighs and tears how vain, 
When this cruel war is over 
Freeing them to meet again. 

But our country calls you loved ones
Angels guide your way 
While you southern boys are fighting 
We can only pray. 

When you strike for God and freedom 
Let all nations see 
How you loved your southern banner
Emblem of the free. 

Weeping sad and lonely 
Sighs and tears how vain 
When this cruel war is over 
Freeing them to meet again. 

If amid the line of battle
Nobly you should fall 
Far away from those who loved you 
None to hear your call. 

Oft in dream I see you lying 
On a battle plain 
Lonely, wounded, even dying
Calling but in vain.
