The Two Orphans by Lemuel Jeffus, Lovelady, Texas.

I never can forget those two orphans. 
Bad luck seems to dwell in their way.
It seems they were brought to the city, 
The lives of our dear ones to take.

The doors were opened at seven, 
And the curtains were rolled up at eight.
And those that were seated were happy.
Outside they were mad that were late.

It's, hark, do you hear the cry fire?
How dismal those bells they do sound.
Tis Brooklyn's theater that's burning, 
Alas, burning down to the ground.

The mothers were weeping and crying 
For the sons who had been out all night.
They prayed that their souls would meet in heaven.
Among the innocent and bright.

Next morning among those black ruins,
Oh God, what a sight met our eyes.
The dead, they were lying in all shapes.
Some of them you could not recognize.

I never can forget those two orphans. 
Bad luck seems to dwell in their way.
It seems they were brought to our city, 
The lives of our dear ones to take.
