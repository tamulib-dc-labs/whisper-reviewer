Dying Girl's Message by Mrs. Irvin Thompson.

Raise the window higher, mother,
Air can never harm me now
Let the breeze blow wind upon me.
It will cool my fevered brow.

Death will soon relieve my sorrow, 
Soon relieve my aching heart.
I have a dying message, mother.
I must speak before we part.

There is one, you know him, mother.
Oh I cannot call his name. 
You remember how he won me.
And in loving words he came. 

How he gained my young affections 
Vowing then in gentle tone. 
Then he would forever love me, 
My love and his alone.

Take this ring from off my finger 
Where he placed it long ago. 
Give it to him with the blessing 
That in dying I bestow. 

Tell him that some token, mother,
Of forgiveness and of peace
And his voice til death I hear it
May the parting never cease.

Raise the curtain higher, mother, 
Clasp me close and kiss me too.
Comfort me in spite of misery,
Tis the Savior calling me.
