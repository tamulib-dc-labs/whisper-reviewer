I’ll tell you what a time I had with Davy Crockett,
Half horse, half coon, and half dry rocket
I met Colonel Davy going out a-coonin’
Says I, “Davy Crockett, how’d you hunt without a gun?”

I followed along with Davy till Davy found a squirrel
Sitting on a pine log eating sheep sorrel;
And he stopped right still and for me began to feel;
Says he, "Pompey Smash let me brace against your heel."

I stuck out my heel for to brace up the sinner,
Old Davy began to grin a little harder for his dinner. 
Oh, at last Davy said "Oh he surely must be dead, 
For I thought I saw the bark fall around the critter's head."

We both went up for the truth to discover;
The devil rose to old Pompey Smash's liver;
'Twas a great big knot about the size of a barrel,
Says I, "Davy Crockett, do you call that a squirrel?
And a ha ha ha.” "Oh, I'll tell you black calf, oh, I tell you you mustn't laugh,
If you do, I'll pin your ears back and bite you in half.

I throwed down my gun and I dropped my ammunition,
Says I, "Davy Crockett, I'll cool your ambition."
He back both ears and he puffed like a steamer;
Says he, "Pompey Smash, I'm a Tennessee screamer."
And we both locked arms and I thought my breath was gone,
For I was never hugged so tight since the day I was born.

We fought half a day and we both agreed to drop it,
For I was badly whipped and so was Davy Crockett.
Come to examine for our heads, gosh, both of them was missing,
For he had bit off my head and I had swallowed his'n;
And we both did agree for to let the other be,
For I was rather hard for him and so was he for me.
