This is a very old ballad, Keep Your Garden Clean, an old English ballad.

Come all you pretty fair maids 
Who flourish in your prime, 
Be sure you keep your garden clean 
Let no one take your thyme.

In June grows a primrose, 
But it's no flower for me.
I'll pluck up my primrose 
And plant a willow tree. 

Green willow, Iâ€™ll wear, love, 
With sorrow mixed among 
To show to all the world 
That I loved a false young man.
