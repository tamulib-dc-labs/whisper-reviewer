Oh, by and by, by and by.
When all the saints of God are gathering home, 
We will tell the story how we've overcome, 
And we'll understand it better by and by.

Temptations often take us unaware,
And our hearts to be made a message loud indeed,
And we'll wonder why when we try to do our best,
And we'll understand it better by and by.

Oh, by and by, by and by.
When all the saints of God are gathering home, 
We will tell the story how we've overcome, 
And we'll understand it better by and by.

Oh, by and by, by and by.
When all the saints of God are gathering home, 
We will tell the story how we've overcome, 
And we'll understand it better by and by.
