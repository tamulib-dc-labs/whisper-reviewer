Junior Quartet, the Old Elam Baptist Church, New Texas.

Two wings in glory, to veil my face,
Two wings in glory, by my side,
Two wings in glory, to veil my face,
Two wings in glory, fly away.

Two wings in glory, to veil my face,
Two wings in glory, by my side,
Two wings in glory, to veil my face,
Two wings in glory, fly away.

One of these mornings, bright and fair,
One of these mornings, bright and fair,
One of these mornings, bright and fair,
Took my wings and gone to fly in the air.

Two wings in glory, to veil my face,
Two wings in glory, by my side,
Two wings in glory, to veil my face,
Two wings in glory, fly away.

Two wings in glory, to veil my face,
Two wings in glory, by my side,
Two wings in glory, to veil my face,
Two wings in glory, fly away.
