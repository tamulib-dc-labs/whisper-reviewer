Will you wear red, my dearest girl?
Will you wear red, Jennie Jenkins?
I won’t wear red,
It is the color of the dead,
I’ll buy me a filly folly dilly dolly
Double rosie-bound to wear
The old Jennie Jenkins.

Will you wear brown, my dearest girl?
Will you wear brown, Jennie Jenkins?
I won’t wear brown,
It is the color of the ground,
I’ll buy me a filly folly dilly dolly
Double rosie-bound to wear
The old Jennie Jenkins.
