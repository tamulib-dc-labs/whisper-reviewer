Popeye Johnson. 

Call the number of the train I ride;
I'm gonna call the number of the train I ride;
Number one, number two, three, number four, and five.

Number one done gone, number two standing in the yard;
Number one done gone, number two standing in the yard;
I want to see my baby - another man has got me barred.

Sometimes I think women and whiskey are going to be my ruin;
Sometimes I think women and whiskey are going to be my ruin;
I know I cain’t live like this a long time, mama, if I keep on doing like I’m doing.

Oh, T for Texas, T for Tennessee;
Oh, T for Texas, T for Tennessee;
I mean it’s T for teeny mama, the one I want to see.

Popeye Johnson and Ghost with the Popeye Johnson Blues.

Yes, yes, play it, Ghost.

Fight it, Lord, fight it, fight it hard.
