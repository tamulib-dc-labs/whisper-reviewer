If Brother Jack Were Here.

Two drummers they were seated 
In a grand hotel one day. 
While dining they were chatting 
In a joking sort of way. 
There came a pretty waitress 
To bring a tray of food.
They spoke to her familiarly 
In a manner rather rude.

At first she did not notice 
Or make a least reply. 
But one remark was made to her 
Brought teardrops to her eye.
She turned on her tormentors. 
Her cheeks were blushing red, 
Approaching as a picture, 
And this is what she said, 

“My mother was a lady
 And this you will allow,
You may have a sister 
Who needs protection now.
I've come to this great city 
To find my brother dear.
You would never dare insult me sir 
If brother Jack were here.”

These two sat there in silence.
Their heads hung down with shame.
“Forgive me, miss, we meant no harm.
Pray tell me what's your name?”
She told him and he cried aloud,
“I know your brother too. 
We've been friends for many, many years 
And he often speaks of you.

“Come go with me when I go back, 
And if you'll only wish, 
I'll take you to him as my bride, 
For I love you at once,” he said.

My mother was a lady, 
And this you would allow.
You may have a sister 
Who needs protection now.
