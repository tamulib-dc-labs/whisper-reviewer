There was an old woman in our town, in our town she did dwell
She loved her husband dearly, but another one twice as well,
Fa la la, fa la lay, fa la la, fa la lay.

She went to the doctor to see what she could find, 
To see what she could find something to make the old man go blind.
Fa la la, fa la lay, fa la la, fa la lay.

The doctor, he told her to get some marrow bones, 
And then to give him them all, and he couldn't see her at all.
Fa la la, fa la lay, fa la la, fa la lay.

Oh, I'd hold myself this very day, if I could find the way,
See, I'll go along with you, for fear you go astray.
Fa la la, fa la lay, fa la la, fa la lay.

They walk away, they walk away to the shore.
Turn the kind and loving wife, you better tell your own.
Fa la la, fa la lay, fa la la, fa la lay.

She steps back to close the old man 
He steps to one side to let her tumble in 
Fa la la, fa la lay, fa la la, fa la lay. 

She first began to kick and then began to bawl 
He says, “Oh kind and loving wife I can't see you at all.”
Fa la la, fa la lay, fa la la, fa la lay.
