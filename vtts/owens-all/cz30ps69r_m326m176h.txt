This song was used to entertain children with.

Oh, John-awn-wonnie went down-wow-wown 
To the fie-wee-wield for the more-wo-wow, 
And a rattle from a sna-wa-wake came 
And bit him on the hee-wee-weel.

Oh, John-awn-wonnie sat down-wow-wown 
And shut both eye-wy-weyes 
And looked all arow-wow-wownd

Kind old da-wa-waddie went and stowed the new-wew-wews
And yonder comes Sa-wa-wallie
Without her shoe-woo-woos.

“Oh, John-awn-wonnie, why'd you go-wo-wo 
To the fie-wee-wield for to more-wo-wo
And a rattle from a sna-wa-wake came and bit him on the hee-wee-weel?”

“Oh, Sa-wa-wallie don't you know-wo-wo, 
When the grass gets high-wi-wi, 
It has to be mow-wo-woed.”
