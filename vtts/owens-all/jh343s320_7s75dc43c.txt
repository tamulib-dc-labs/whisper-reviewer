Cowboy Jack, by Daniel Jeffus, a little bit of text.

Your sweetheart, wait for you, Jack. Your sweetheart, wait for you.
Out on the lonely prairie where the skies are always blue.

One night when work was thinning, At the close of day, 
Someone says sing a song, Jack to drive our cares away.

When Jack began his singing, his mind wandered back.
He was singing of a maiden who was waiting for her Jack.

He left the camp next morning, repeating his sweetheart's name.
Said I'll go and ask forgiveness, for I know that I'm to blame.

But when he reached the prairie, he found a new-made mound.
And his friend they sadly told him they had laid his loved one down. 

They say that she was dying, she grieved her sweetheart's name
It'll go and ask forgiveness, for I know that I'm to blame.

Your sweetheart waits for you, Jack. Your sweetheart waits for you.
Out on the lonely prairie, where the skies are always blue.
