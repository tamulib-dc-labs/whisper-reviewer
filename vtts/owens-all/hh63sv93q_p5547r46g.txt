Oh, when the saints go mar-

Oh when the saints

Oh, when they crown, oh when they crown, 
Them lords of all, them lords of all,
Oh when they crown them lords of all,
Lord, I want to be in that number,
Oh, when they crown them lords of all.

Oh, when they kneel, oh, when they kneel
At Jesus' feet, at Jesusâ€™ feet,
Oh, when they kneel at Jesus' fee,
Lord, I want to be in that number,
when they kneel at Jesus' feet.

Oh, when the saints, oh when the saints, 
Go marching in, go marching in,
Oh, when the saints go marching in, 
Lord, I want to be in that number, 
Oh, when the saints go marching in.
