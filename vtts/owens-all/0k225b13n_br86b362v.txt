Two little children, a boy and a girl, 
Sat by an old church door.
The little girl's feet were as brown as the curls 
That fell on the dress that she wore.
The boy's coat was faded and hatless his head, 
A tear showing in his little eye.
“Why don't you run home to your mama?” she said.
And this was the maiden's reply:

“We can't earn our bread, we’re too little,” she said.
“Jim's five years, I'm only seven.
We've come here to stay 
For the close of the day 
For we have no mama or home. 

Mama's in heaven, 
They took her away, 
Left Jim and I all alone.”
“Why don't you run home to your mama?” she said. 
And this was the maiden's reply:

“Mama's in heaven, they took her away 
Left Jim and I all alone. 
We've come here to stay for the close of the day 
For we have no mama or home. 

“Papa's lost out on the sea long ago, 
We waited all night on the shore.
For he was life-saving captain, you know, 
And he never came back anymore.”

“We can't earn our bread, we're too little,” she said.
“Jim's five years, I'm only seven.
They come here to stay for the close of the day, 
For we have no mama in our home.”

The sexton came early to ring the church bell 
And found them beneath the snow-white.
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell 
In heaven with mama that night.

“We can't earn our bread, we're too little,” she said.
“Jim's five years, I'm only seven.
They come here to stay for the close of the day
