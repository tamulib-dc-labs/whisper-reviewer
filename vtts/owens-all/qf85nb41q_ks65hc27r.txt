The Master's Runned Away, sung by Lemuel Jeffus, Lovelady, Texas.

Oh, darkies, have you seen the master this morning with the mustache on his face?
He was all dressed up this very morning like he's gonna leave the place.
Oh, the master left the place, and the darkies stayed at home.
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the era of jubilo.

He's five foot one way, six foot the other, and he's 500 pounds.
His coat's so big that he can't pay the tailor and it won't meet half around.
Oh, the master's ran away, and the darkies stayed at home.
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the era of jubilo.

The master's saw the smoke way up the river where the Lincoln gunboats lay.
And he picked up his hat and he left in a hurry and I think he's ran away.
Oh, the master's ran away and the darkies stayed at home.
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the era of jubilo.

The master lives in the big white house and the dark is in the cabin inn on the lawn.
They'll move their things up the master's parlor to keep it while he's gone.
Oh, the master's ran away and the darkies stayed at home.
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the era of jubilo.

There's wine and cider in the smokehouse cellar and the darkies they'll have some.
I think they'll all be confiscated for the length that soldiers come.
Oh, the master's ran away and the darkies stayed at home.
It must be now that the kingdom's coming in the era of jubilo.
