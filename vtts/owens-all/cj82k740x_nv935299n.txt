Oh, by. Oh, by, by and by,
I'm going to lay down my heavy load.
Oh, by. Oh, by, by and by,
I'm going to lay down my heavy load.

Sometimes I’m up, sometimes I’m down,
I'm going to lay down my heavy load.
Sometimes I’m almost to the ground.
I'm going to lay down my heavy load.

Oh, by. Oh, by, by and by.
