It's me, it's me, oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.
It's me, it's me, oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.

It's not my mother, but it's me oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.
It's not my mother, but it's me oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.

It's me, it's me, oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.
It's me, it's me, oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.

It's not my father, but it's me oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.
It's not my father, but it's me oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.

It's me, it's me, oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.
It's me, it's me, oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.

It's me, it's me, oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.
It's me, it's me, oh Lord,
Standing in the need of prayer.
