I'm on my way to the kingdom land.
I'm on my way to the kingdom land.
I'm on my way to the kingdom land.
I'm on my way, way oh Lord, to the kingdom land, to the kingdom land.

I want somebody to come go with me.
I want somebody to come go with me.
I want somebody to come go with me.
I'm on my way, way oh Lord, to the kingdom land, to the kingdom land.

And if you don't go, don't you hinder me.
And if you don't go, don't you hinder me.
And if you don't go, don't you hinder me.
I'm on my way, way oh Lord, to the kingdom land, to the kingdom land.
