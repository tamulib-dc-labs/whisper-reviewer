Corinne, Corinna, where you've been so long? 
Corinne, Corinna, where you've been so long? 
I had no loving since you've been gone.

I met Corinna way across the sea.
I met Corinna way across the sea.
She didn't give me no loving. She didn't care for me.

Corinne, Corinna, where've you been last night? 
Corinne, Corinna, where've you been last night? 
Now it's morning, and it's shining bright.

Come get your water before the world goes dry.
Come get your water before the world goes dry.
