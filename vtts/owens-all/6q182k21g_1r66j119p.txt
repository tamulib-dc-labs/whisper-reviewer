Where are the Hebrew children? Sung by Lily Williams.

Where are the Hebrew children?
Where are the Hebrew children?
Where are the Hebrew children?
Safe in the promised land.

Though the furnace flamed around them, 
God while in his mercy found them,
And with love and mercy bound them, 
Safe in the promised land.

Where are the holy martyrs?
Where are the holy martyrs?
Where are the holy martyrs?
Safe in the promised land.

Those who washed their robes, 
Made them white, pure, and spotless,
And they made them where no earthly stained them, 
Safe in the promised land.

Where are the twelve apostles?
Where are the twelve apostles?
Where are the twelve apostles?
Safe in the promised land.

They went through the flaming fire, 
Trusting in the great Messiah,
Holy grace did lift them higher, 
Safe in the promised land.

Where are the holy Christians?
Where are the holy Christians?
Where are the holy Christians?
Safe in the promised land.

Their souls have joined the chorus,
Saints and angels sing before us,
While the heavens beaming over us, 
Safe in the promised land.

By and by, we'll go and meet them,
By and by, we'll go and meet them,
By and by, we'll go and meet them, 
Safe in the promised land.

There we'll sing and shout together.
There we'll sing and shout forever.
There we'll sing and shout to Zion, 
Safe in the promised land.
