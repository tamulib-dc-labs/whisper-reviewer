My Shanghai Rooster.

Oh I had a farm out west, of farms it was the best,
Had a cross-eyed mule with freckles and red hair,
I had one old Shanghai rooster with a wart on his left ear, 
But now he's died and climbed the golden stair.

Oh, my poor old Shanghai rooster in battle nobly fell.
For the brown bulldog, he fought long and brave.
All the hens are on a strike, they haven't laid since Saturday night.
They are weeping over my Shanghai rooster's grave.

Some more are coming in late, at the hour of half-past eight.
Singing cock-a-doodle-doo and goodbye Kate.
...Some old...
A flirt with a chicken bullet, that's the game.

He'll never crow again, wink his eye at some old hen.
His nester and his maiden name was Jake.
All the hens are on a strike, they haven't laid since Saturday night.
They are weeping over my Shanghai rooster's grave.

Oh, his comb was like an axe, his teeth was like a pus.
His nester and his maiden name were Jake.
All the hens are on a strike, they haven't laid since Saturday night.
They are weeping over my Shanghai rooster's grave.
