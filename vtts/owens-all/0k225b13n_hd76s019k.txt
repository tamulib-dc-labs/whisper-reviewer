Once I had a little sweetheart, 
The age of sixteen.
Her parents at Baltimore, 
The rose of the queen.

Some say I drink whiskey, 
Some say that I'm poor,
Some say that I'm not worthy 
Of entering her door.

I know I drink whiskey, 
But my money is my own,
And those that don't like me 
Can let me alone.

“Get down from your seat, 
And feed them some hay,
And take a seat by me 
As long as you stay.”

“My horses are not hungry,
They won't eat your hay;
I'm traveling to Wyoming, 
I'll feed on my way.”

Some say I drink whiskey, 
Some say that I'm poor,
Some say that I'm not worthy 
Of entering her door.

I know I drink whiskey, 
But my money is my own,
And those that don't like me 
Can let me alone.
