House Carpenter. 

“We've met, we've met,” says the house.
“We've met, we've met,” says he.
“We've met, we've met most joyfully, 
For I have come across the saltwater sea, 
And it's all for the sake of thee.

“I could have married a king's daughter there. 
She offered marriage to me, 
But I have come across the saltwater sea 
And it's all for the sake of thee.”

“If you could have married a king's daughter there 
I'm sure you are to blame. 
For I have married a house carpenter, 
And I think he's a nice young man.”

“Oh, won't you forsake your house carpenter, 
And go along with me?
I'll take you where the grass grows green, 
On the banks of the sweet Willie.”

She took herself into a room, 
And dressed in silk most gay, 
And spread a veil all over her face.
That outshone the glittering day. 

She had not been sailing more than two weeks.
I'm sure it was not three, 
Till this fair lady set herself to weep, 
And wept most bitterly.

“Are you weeping for the house carpenter?
Are you weeping for fear?
Are you weeping for three little babes
That you left when you come with me here?” 

“I'm neither a-weeping for the house carpenter 
I'm neither a-weeping for fear. 
I'm only a-weeping for three little babes 
That I left when I come with you here.” 

She had not been sailing more than three weeks 
I'm sure it was not four,
Till this fair lady threw herself overboard, 
And her mourning was heard no more.

He threw himself around three times, 
With a dark and dreary eye
And so must you and I.
