The Jealous Lover, Opal Patton, Leesville, Texas, March the 4th, 1939.

Down in a lonely valley 
Where the violets gently bloom, 
Florella lies forgotten 
In a cold and silent tomb.

She died not broken-hearted, 
Nor of sickness did she pass. 
But in one moment parted 
From the ones she loved so dear.

One night as the moon shone brightly 
And lightly fell the dew, 
To the lonely cottage, 
Her jealous lover drew.

“Florella, let us wander 
Down the meadow gay. 
There let us sit and ponder 
Upon our wedding day.”

The way was cold and dreary 
The night was coming on. 
Into that lonely valley 
He led the maiden on.

“Oh Edward, I'm so tired, 
Wandering here so long.
The night is cold and dreary. 
I pray you take me home.”

“You have not the wings of an angel, 
Nor from me can you fly.
You cannot now escape me, 
Florella, you must die.”

Down, down on her knees she bended, 
And begged him for her life. 
But into a snowy white bosom 
He plunged a gleaming knife.

“Oh, Edward, I forgive you 
With all my dying breath.
I never have deceived you 
As I close my eyes in death.”
