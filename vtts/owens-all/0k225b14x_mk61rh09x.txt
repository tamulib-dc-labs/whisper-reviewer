This is a fragment of another very old English ballad, that's all I remember. Lovely William.

“There's a tree in father's garden,
Lovely William,” says she.
“Where young men and young maidens, 
They wait there for me.

“Where my father lies in lust, 
Brave deeds for to do.
With a long and silver dagger, 
He pierced his love through.”
