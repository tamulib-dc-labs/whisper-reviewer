The Colored Man's Lament, Abe Melton... March 4, 1939.

Oh, just a little while to stay here, 
Just a little while to wait, 
Just a little more of labor, 
Creeping to the pearly gates.

Oh, just a little while to stay here, 
Just a little while to roam.
Just a little more of trouble, 
And then we'll all go home.
