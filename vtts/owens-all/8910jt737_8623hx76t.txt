Ghost again, here come down playing My Million Dollar Baby.

I've got a million dollar baby, and she's longing,
I've got a million dollar baby, and she's longing,
I swear, and when sheâ€™s weeping, I declare, it's too bad, yeah.

Her face is so pretty; at night, she will kill your soul,
Her face is so pretty; at night, she will kill your soul,
Says I wouldn't take nothing for my baby, even too long, even too long, wait and go.

I'm telling all you men, I just want to be straight and plain,
I'm telling all you men, I just want to be straight and plain,
Yeah, straight and plain, that's right, straight and plain.
Well, it really hurts my feelings to hear another man call your name.

I said she's all right with me, I can see her both night and day,
Yes, that woman's all right with me, I can see her both night and day, 
Says I'd be crazy about that million dollar baby, he just called her way.
