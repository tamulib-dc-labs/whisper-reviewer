Roxy Ann.

Roxy Ann's fooling me.
She fooled me all the while.
She's been a long time fooling, fooling,
She's been a long time fooling me.

Oh, that gal is fooling me.
She fooled me all the while.
She's been a long time fooling, fooling.
She's been a long time fooling me.

See them girls fooling me.
They fooled me all the while.
They've been a long time fooling, fooling,
They've been a long time fooling me.
