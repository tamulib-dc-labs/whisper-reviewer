The Shallow Choir singing Every Time I Feel the Spirit.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

Up on the mountains, when my God spoke, 
Out of his mouth came fire and smoke.
Looked all around me, it looked so fine, 
Till I asked my Lord if all were mine.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

And I have trials, and I have woes, 
And I have heartache, here we go.
But while God leads me, I'll never fear, 
For I am sheltered, I am there.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.

Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
Every time I feel the spirit moving in my heart, I will pray.
