Barbara, sung by May Kennedy McCord, Springfield, 3rd June the 5th, 1939.

In Scarlet Town where I was born, 
There was a fair maid dwelling, 
Made every youth cry, “Way-la-way.
Oh, here comes Barbara Ellen.”

T'was in the merry month of May, 
The green buds were a-swellin', 
Sweet William on his deathbed he lay 
For the love of Barbara Ellen.

They sent a servant to the town 
Where Barbara was a-dwellin', 
Saying, “Rise, oh rise, you up and go 
If your name be Barbara Ellen.”

So slowly, slowly she rose up 
And slowly she come nigh him.
And these the words she said to him, 
“Young man, I think you're dying.”

“Oh, yes, I'm sick, I’m very sick, 
And death is on me dwellin'.
And one sweet kiss would comfort me 
From the lips of Barbara Ellen.”

“Oh, yes, you're sick, and very sick, 
And death is on you dwelling,
But one sweet kiss you never will have 
From the lips of Barbara Ellen.”

Oh, don't you remember on a wedding night 
When we were at the tavern?
You drank a health to the ladies around, 
But you slighted Barbara Ellen.”

“Oh, yes, I remember on a wedding night 
When we were at the tavern.
I drank a health to the ladies around, 
But I loved sweet Barbara Ellen.”
