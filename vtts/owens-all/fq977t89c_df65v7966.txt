This is a song entitled Diamond Joe, sometimes called The Chisholm Trail.

Oh, Diamond Joe was a rich old jay.
With lots of cowboys in his pay.
He rode the range with his cowboy band.
And many a maverick got his brand.
If I was rich, as Diamond Joe, 
I'd work today and I'd work no more.
For the work is so hard and the pay so slow.
But I don't give a darn if I work or no.

Roll on, boys, roll, don't you roll too slow.
Roll on, boys, roll, don't you roll too slow.
Hi-oh, hi-oh, you roll like boys, never rolled before.

I left my girl in a Texas shack, 
And I told her I wasn't coming back.
But I lost that card and I got in jail 
And I found myself on the Chatham Trail. 
I'll stay with the herd till I reach the end, 
Drag my time and I'll blow it in. 
Just one more spree and one more jail, 
And I'll head back home on the Chatham Trail.

Roll on, boys, roll, don't you roll too slow.
Roll on, boys, roll, don't you roll too slow.
Hi-oh, hi-oh, you roll like boys, never rolled before.

I'll stay with a herd till 
I bought old Red at the Texas line,
And I'll head back home to that girl of mine. 
And I'll sit in the shade and sing this song, 
And watch the herd go drifting home. 
When the time has come to leave this world 
I'll say goodbye to my little girl
I'll hold my hands when I have to go 
And say goodbye, “Old Diamond Joe.”
