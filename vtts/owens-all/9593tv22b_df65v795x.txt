The Old Maid.

I'll take my stool and sit in the shade, 
For I'm determined to be an old maid.
I'll not marry at all, at all.
I'll not marry at all.

I would not marry a preacher, 
For he'd have holes in the knees of his breeches.
I'll not marry at all, at all.
I'll not marry at all.

I would not marry a man that is tall, 
For he'd go bumping against the wall.
I'll not marry at all, at all.
I'll not marry at all.

I would not marry a man that is small,
For he'd be the same as no man at all.
I'll not marry at all, at all.
I'll not marry at all.
