00:08.860 --> 00:12.800
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.480 --> 00:33.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.140
And here are your hosts.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.440
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.940
Harry Harrison has made a name for himself in science fiction in many areas.

00:48.320 --> 00:51.860
He's noted for his novels, short stories, and the anthologies he's edited.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.740
One of Harrison's notable contributions is the popularization of so-called adventure

00:55.740 --> 00:56.480
science fiction.

00:56.680 --> 01:01.020
It's typified by the trilogy whose volumes are aptly named Death World One, Death World

01:01.020 --> 01:02.300
Two, and Death World Three.

01:02.740 --> 01:06.320
Harrison told us how this particular brand of science fiction originated with the writing

01:06.320 --> 01:07.380
of Death World One.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.760
You mentioned the fact that there's adventure science fiction.

01:11.200 --> 01:17.180
Well, don't laugh, but at that time in science fiction, which was Campbell, which was analog.

01:17.700 --> 01:22.900
If you were a true blue reader, you read Starling's stories in Sling Wonder, because you'd

01:22.900 --> 01:25.700
had to wait another three weeks for the next issue of astounding.

01:25.860 --> 01:26.640
That's where the action was.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.720
And he had been very cerebral.

01:28.940 --> 01:31.440
He had a whole novel of people talking to each other.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.880
Nothing moving at all, no action.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.880
And I want to do a book that had action part of the plot.

01:38.240 --> 01:41.020
I mean, that's sort of stupid to say now with all the guns blowing heads away.

01:41.160 --> 01:46.000
I mean, that whole gore school and the whole sword and sorcery, sword and butchery.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.800
I mean, action galore for no reason at all.

01:49.940 --> 01:52.360
But in those days, it was getting dim, I thought.

01:52.980 --> 01:56.200
So I worked out, but I didn't want to do an action plot for action, say.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.940
So I'm a great back plotter, and I find a reason to do a book, and then I put a book

02:00.940 --> 02:01.460
to the reason.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.060
And the reason I wanted to have the action, I wanted to have a realistic.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.420
So I thought it was Superman.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.720
And in this book, you find, if you look at it closely, it's done two or three levels.

02:12.820 --> 02:14.000
The action plots a service.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.600
But there below that is the idea of Superman, the Nietzsche talked about.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.100
And that Superman magazine talks about.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.040
And I'm very much against Superman, physical Superman.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.660
And if you look in the book, you'll see that if you are so brutalized to be

02:27.660 --> 02:30.860
physically a Superman, your intellectual content is zero.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.920
And I said it in a number of different ways.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.360
And I'm very much against militarism, and that's been there in a number of different ways.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.660
All of it couched in his venture plot.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.060
And it's up to the reader to read it whichever way he wants.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.800
And he'll find a good adventure plot if he wants to find even more about it.

02:48.060 --> 02:51.480
Remember when I first published it, a reader in England came up to me, and

02:51.480 --> 02:54.740
I was looking forward to great return from literate Englishmen about

02:55.840 --> 02:57.700
heavily intellectual content.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.280
And he said, all areas that I read that book, I sold my friends to read,

03:02.380 --> 03:07.360
all I like it, you did, but you tell me, all read, I said, it's all about guns.

03:18.260 --> 03:20.860
The protagonist of Death World One is Jason DenAlt.

03:21.180 --> 03:23.760
Harrison liked him so much that he had to write two more installments.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.280
The Death World two and three came out by happenstance.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.620
It's just that the character was successful.

03:30.260 --> 03:32.680
I want to write another adventure style book.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.200
And I realized after I wrote it, I left the ending open.

03:36.660 --> 03:39.720
You had to get these people off that planet, the certain part of them had to leave.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.100
They just go for killing things.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.800
He starts thinking about it and their friends with his.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.100
And he's a weak man personally.

03:46.580 --> 03:48.860
And he has, like I say, he supplies a part.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.560
So they don't supply, they have the big bodies and the tiny point heads.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.900
He's a weakling in their terms, but he's a man of intelligence.

03:55.660 --> 03:57.940
So therefore, I said, gee, what if there was another planet?

03:58.020 --> 03:58.600
He had a problem.

03:59.020 --> 04:00.380
He'd have to go along and organize it.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.060
And then the plot developed.

04:02.940 --> 04:06.360
I did that once more, and that was the end of it, as far as I was concerned.

04:06.920 --> 04:07.900
People asked for another Death World.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.180
And no, I run that particular plot device while I was pinned into it.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.400
It worked three times.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.200
It worked pretty well.

04:14.700 --> 04:17.720
Harrison told us his books usually have philosophical content.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.500
Death World Two, for instance.

04:20.380 --> 04:26.040
OK, Death World Two, you may think it's about going off and blowing things up

04:26.040 --> 04:27.640
and killing things and rushing around.

04:28.220 --> 04:29.020
It really is.

04:29.100 --> 04:33.660
The entire book is about the difference in meaning between ethics and ethos.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.340
And that's what it's about.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.880
I keep repeating over and over through that thing.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.340
And a lot of guns go off.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.260
A lot of good things happen.

04:40.420 --> 04:41.400
You learn a bit of Esperanto.

04:42.100 --> 04:47.060
But also, what science fiction can do, it's a book that takes the study

04:47.060 --> 04:49.480
of a philosophical question or a problem of meaning.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.420
We'll have more with Harry Harrison on our next show.

04:59.460 --> 05:03.820
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:03.820 --> 05:08.020
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:29.100 --> 06:33.040
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:48.840 --> 06:54.160
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.500
And here are your hosts.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.660
This is Daryl Lane.

07:03.780 --> 07:04.380
And Bill Vernon.

07:04.820 --> 07:08.240
One of Science Fiction writer Harry Harrison's most unforgettable character is the slippery

07:08.240 --> 07:10.140
Jim DeGrees, the stainless steel rat.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.500
The Stainless Steel Rats adventure spin five novels so far.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.860
We asked Harrison where he got the concept of a stainless steel rat.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.880
I remember the basic idea.

07:19.480 --> 07:25.480
It was just that, as the old rat says, we have flesh and blood rats and wooden buildings.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.740
We'll have stainless steel rats and concrete ones.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.120
Then Harrison went on to tell us a bit about the first novel in the series, the Stainless

07:32.120 --> 07:33.960
Steel Rat, and how the idea then grew.

07:34.900 --> 07:40.300
It's basically a very old idea of the villain as hero.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.420
Turn the world on his head.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.560
This is what we have in the saint.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.420
Who tended to pontificate a little bit too much.

07:47.260 --> 07:52.840
It's Rupert of Hentzau and that prisoner of Zenda.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.280
We all love him better than we do the goodie goodies with his job.

07:57.840 --> 08:02.340
It is, if you pardon the expression, my dear friend Kingsley Amis had a pick-a-rest novel.

08:02.980 --> 08:04.500
Don't be ashamed if you don't understand what that means.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.780
I said, thanks Kingsley.

08:05.840 --> 08:06.560
I ran off to a dictionary.

08:07.340 --> 08:08.700
The pick-a-rest novel is just that.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.160
The villain as the hero as villain and villain as hero.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.960
And when I realized what I was doing, I had come onto a formula and I was trying to get

08:16.960 --> 08:17.980
humor into it as well.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.280
There was no humor in Science Fiction.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.240
There was nothing that I was doing.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.260
Anyone else alive, the character developed as he went along.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.700
And I get clues back from readers about it.

08:28.120 --> 08:35.120
And an English reader told me he likes to read this thing because the hero does all the

08:35.120 --> 08:38.100
thing he wish he could do against society and gets away with it.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.620
Everyone hates bureaucracy.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.980
And I said, my God, you're right.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.340
I thought about it in the very next rat book.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.720
The first chapter, nothing to do with the rest of the book.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.060
The first chapter we look at, just something happens to his dear wife, Angelina, and the

08:50.060 --> 08:50.740
enemy has her.

08:50.780 --> 08:51.220
And he goes off.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.140
The enemy is the internal review service, the old IRS man.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.220
He goes and burns on all income tax records for the whole planet, cheering everybody up.

08:58.460 --> 08:59.620
And the story begins.

09:00.220 --> 09:03.140
But that's something we all wish could happen tomorrow except that people work for the IRS.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.200
The Stainless Steel Rat novels form a humorous adventure series.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.140
We ask Harris in what place humor has in Science Fiction.

09:10.740 --> 09:11.460
Very little.

09:12.640 --> 09:13.960
It could have a bigger one.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.220
And the answer is a very mechanical one.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.400
Editors, for the most part, are dummies.

09:20.640 --> 09:25.180
And even the few bright ones have their own particular taste in humor.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.560
That is a matter of taste.

09:27.220 --> 09:31.020
You bring an adventure novel in, and it will say, yeah, well, Harry's unbetter, but it

09:31.020 --> 09:33.020
moves along, people are killed, I'll buy it.

09:33.620 --> 09:37.340
Bring a love story in, oh, well, girl gets kissed, you know, it's a little boring, but I'll buy it.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.100
You bring in a humor novel, he doesn't laugh.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.040
He does not buy it.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.940
And if they laugh, I've heard them say, one of them is a rejecter, it was too funny.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.260
They're afraid the readers won't laugh.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.260
So the only way you can have a reputation is a humor writer.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.220
And how do you get a humor writer?

09:54.300 --> 09:55.720
You've got to sell a book, but you can't sell it.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.220
It's a catch-22 thing.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.500
And I snuck it in the Stainless Steel Rat.

09:59.700 --> 10:04.300
I would make each one a little bit funny than the one before, and eventually, the editor was laughing, readers were laughing,

10:04.460 --> 10:05.760
hurrah, I'm a humor writer.

10:06.700 --> 10:10.700
Harrison's early characters, Jason DenAult and Slippery Jim DeGrees, are strong characters.

10:11.180 --> 10:14.500
But Harrison told us science fiction is really based on ideas, not characters.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.100
Science fiction is not a character-based form of fiction.

10:18.500 --> 10:23.180
You can have three-dimensional characters in science fiction, but the idea comes first.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.300
It's not an idea fiction.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.640
The form of fiction, we can have an idea as a hero.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.980
The main thing that has that is what you call three-dimensional.

10:31.820 --> 10:34.980
Have the idea for a character who would do these things.

10:36.980 --> 10:43.960
Which means far too often in science fiction, you'll get two-dimensional characters who just act the assigned role of the plot, given to by the author.

10:44.580 --> 10:45.840
And we don't mind reading that.

10:45.940 --> 10:52.840
We really want to read about the action to make good science fiction, viable, interesting, fun science fiction,

10:53.320 --> 10:57.580
when you have to assign the character to the role, you must build his character as a character.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.700
That's where the art comes in.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.200
There are two things in all kinds of fiction.

11:01.340 --> 11:03.560
The craft of science fiction, constructing your plot.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.780
The art of science fiction is making your characters three-dimensional.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.740
Which is true for any character I write.

11:11.160 --> 11:15.080
Very rarely in science fiction do you have character-based fiction.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.340
If you have, it's usually not science fiction.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.280
More with Harry Harrison on our next show.

12:24.700 --> 12:28.680
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

12:44.420 --> 12:49.760
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.100
And here are your hosts.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.500
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

13:00.720 --> 13:05.220
Perhaps science fiction author Harry Harrison's single most famous novel is Bill, The Galactic Hero.

13:05.780 --> 13:11.140
The protagonist is Bill, a hayseed from the farm who gets Shanghai into the Empire Space Corps to fight the evil Chingers.

13:11.440 --> 13:16.140
Bill, the Galactic Hero, is a spoof of war, bureaucracy, and the pulps, among other things.

13:16.620 --> 13:19.780
Here, here is some comments and some of the influences which helped inspire the novel.

13:21.020 --> 13:24.460
Bill, the Galactic Hero, there again, he was assigned the role.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.980
He was a good soldier, Shfaq.

13:29.500 --> 13:33.480
He's the guy who gets it in the neck all the time and had to be a science fiction army.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.260
And I think he just made it explode in me.

13:37.540 --> 13:43.720
Having been in the army and seated here in the heart of the military, I'm an enlisted man.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.620
I have the highest rank in the army, that of a sergeant.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.500
You have to get to general before you get anything higher than that.

13:48.540 --> 13:50.880
Second lieutenant, you know, grubs to be walked on.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.400
And the whole different attitude.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.700
And the officers like the military.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.060
They like to tell people what to do.

13:58.700 --> 14:03.560
And usually what they tell them to do is not for the good of the people they're talking to, they should get killed for it.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.640
But the enlisted men want to stay alive.

14:07.260 --> 14:11.640
As the Osirians said in Catch-22, they're trying to kill me.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.940
He didn't mean the enemy, he meant the army he was in.

14:14.780 --> 14:17.560
And knowing all this, reading all this, Catch-22 came out.

14:17.660 --> 14:19.380
I was a great fan of Kandy.

14:20.180 --> 14:31.080
And when I saw Catch-22, what he did, the heller did, he showed that there's something so awful that you have to laugh at them to understand them.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.780
If you do a military novel, you say, blood, blood, death, and testines from the trees.

14:35.140 --> 14:38.440
By the 20th time you hang the testines from the trees, you're tired of looking at them.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.700
It looks like spaghetti after a while.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.220
Repetition of horror doesn't make horror.

14:42.220 --> 14:46.080
And that's all you can do. The army is utterly horrible, boring and wasteful.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.860
The military life is boring and wasteful.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.660
And in there, I parodied a few other novels just for fun of it.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.920
But the thing that goes right through it is understanding the military.

15:01.540 --> 15:08.600
Usually I discovered that I had a Korean war veteran come up to me and come at my reunion and wouldn't have his face all shut away.

15:10.500 --> 15:14.660
And he said, you wrote Bill a Glatine Hero?

15:14.820 --> 15:16.560
I said, yes, looking for a chair to hide behind.

15:17.320 --> 15:22.260
He said, I've got a copy of every edition of that book. I carry it through to combat, you know?

15:22.720 --> 15:24.220
And that tells a story.

15:25.100 --> 15:28.300
Another guy with the same thing, John Paul.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.700
He's a real Green Beret, a kind of hitter, bangler.

15:31.740 --> 15:34.120
He worked with the Montagniers, not like John Wayne with the fake one.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.380
You know, he was up there and he killed him.

15:36.380 --> 15:36.960
He was a great killer.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.700
And Napoleon's troops carried a marshals back on their pack.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.420
He carried a copy of Bill a Glatine Hero, all through the Korean war up there.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.260
He was killing gooks and everything.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.140
And he said, his rookie's in.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.500
He reads him a chapter every night whether they liked it or not.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.100
He'd break him in half, you know?

15:56.900 --> 16:01.240
So I really feel that it's humor and parody and a lot of fun.

16:01.240 --> 16:05.920
But it tells you something about the military condition that is absolutely dead true.

16:11.700 --> 16:16.480
In fact, Harrison believes his version of war, as depicted in Bill the Galactic Hero,

16:16.980 --> 16:20.080
comes closer to reality than do the more serious novels of others.

16:20.760 --> 16:25.280
The pro-military novel is like Starship Trooper, you know, where everyone's being kind to each other.

16:25.280 --> 16:29.560
I mean, in fact, I saw Norman Spindrad put it in the article the other week.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.900
As Harry Harrison said, Bill Glatine, it's always Bob your buddy week.

16:34.680 --> 16:39.080
And this was, we said in the army, in a novel whose name I shall not mention,

16:39.620 --> 16:41.200
the guy in the heavy space armor is going down.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.020
All friends come to rescue him, you know?

16:44.320 --> 16:47.560
And in Bill, the guy goes in a swamp and the soldier in the marching by says,

16:47.620 --> 16:48.380
help me, help me.

16:48.420 --> 16:51.700
And they walk on by, says, Bob your buddy week.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.720
And they say it's always Bob your buddy week.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.200
And that's just, we should say in the army, you know?

16:56.720 --> 16:59.820
I mean, it always is.

17:00.080 --> 17:00.960
It's every man for himself.

17:03.040 --> 17:03.760
Normally, normally.

17:04.780 --> 17:07.000
You expect to get it put in broken off, and usually does.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.180
We'll have more with Harry Harrison on our next show.

17:10.180 --> 17:19.880
Well, this has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

17:20.240 --> 17:22.840
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

17:22.840 --> 17:26.020
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

18:13.940 --> 18:18.140
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

18:36.380 --> 18:39.200
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.520
And here are your hosts.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.020
This is Daryl Lane.

18:49.160 --> 18:49.740
And Bill Vernon.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.460
Harry Harrison is noted for his humorous science fiction works,

18:52.560 --> 18:53.920
as well as his venture science fiction.

18:54.260 --> 18:57.560
Right, but Harrison wrote the very serious novel Make Room, Make Room,

18:57.680 --> 19:01.200
which portrays a grim near future earth plagued with overpopulation.

19:01.620 --> 19:05.160
Some may be more familiar with the movie loosely based on this novel, Soylent Green.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.580
Harrison's concern for overpopulation inspired his writing Make Room, Make Room.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.560
His primary concern while writing was to void both lecturing and preaching.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.940
And I felt very serious about population.

19:16.300 --> 19:17.440
At that time, I wrote the book.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.720
There were no fictional works on population.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.500
There were no, at least, popular nonfiction books hadn't come out.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.560
The world was completely unaware where we were going.

19:25.200 --> 19:25.860
And I could see it.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.220
I lived in Mexico and watched what was happening.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.560
You read the Learned Journalist. He told you about it.

19:29.940 --> 19:33.820
So I wanted to do a propaganda work that was disguised as not being propaganda.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.000
And so I said it in the year 1999 in New York.

19:38.620 --> 19:42.640
I made some millennial novel, bring a lot of overtones, you know, the millennium,

19:42.880 --> 19:44.160
coming of Christ and the sort of thing.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.700
And I didn't want to lecture.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.720
So I very simply started the book, put the characters in the world,

19:50.800 --> 19:52.620
went along for almost a fifth of the book,

19:53.760 --> 19:58.780
and got everyone involved before someone turned to one character, the older character.

19:59.060 --> 20:00.720
How did the world get this way?

20:00.720 --> 20:04.920
At this point, I felt the reader was trapped enough to take one page of the lecture.

20:05.460 --> 20:06.820
And I sent the book in my room and said,

20:06.900 --> 20:08.780
Harry, they're trapped up to take four pages of the lecture.

20:09.300 --> 20:13.560
So I just put in four pages, a copy of about a thousand words, two pages in the book,

20:14.060 --> 20:16.020
telling you how it worked out that way.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.960
And I said, my one little lecture right there, having done that little lecture,

20:20.680 --> 20:23.400
it was, in a sense, a work of propaganda and art.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.060
If you have better the art, you have better the propaganda.

20:25.800 --> 20:26.820
1984 is propaganda.

20:27.940 --> 20:28.920
On the beach is propaganda.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.780
Both art, you get the message.

20:31.320 --> 20:31.820
And that was it.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
And after that, I worked around the point.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.680
And if you were alive and warm, you understood it.

20:36.280 --> 20:37.040
And the readers did.

20:38.460 --> 20:42.920
Harrison worked hard to involve the reader by painting a picture of the future using indirect descriptions,

20:43.240 --> 20:45.460
rather than simply telling the reader the situation directly.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.940
I think having worked as an artist for a number of years,

20:49.560 --> 20:52.240
I see in my mind, and I'm writing, I have a stage of people walking around,

20:52.380 --> 20:53.800
and I see what's in the background, the foreground,

20:54.060 --> 20:55.780
I hear the waves splashing and see them splashing.

20:58.800 --> 21:04.660
And as always in writing, you should never tell you should show.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.120
And Good Rang is hard work.

21:08.540 --> 21:09.480
It should be transparent.

21:10.260 --> 21:12.360
The reader should not see how you got the effect.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.820
And one of the best ways, of course, it's hard to do,

21:14.960 --> 21:17.620
is never say the world is full of a lot of people,

21:18.080 --> 21:19.500
never say you're short of water, show them,

21:20.440 --> 21:22.460
unaligned to get water out of a standpipe.

21:22.460 --> 21:26.280
And then you know you're short of water and dramatize their need for the water.

21:27.140 --> 21:33.160
And this is where your art comes in, which far too often,

21:33.260 --> 21:37.600
if the writer cannot do that, then he does not succeed on that level.

21:37.820 --> 21:39.140
People read his book for fun, you know.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.160
But if you can get the reader emotionally involved,

21:41.740 --> 21:42.960
get him trapped into the book,

21:43.300 --> 21:46.300
and he comes out of the end, maybe not agreeing with you,

21:46.400 --> 21:48.760
but at least he knows what you're said, he'll be thinking about it.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.100
And I had one girl read that book out in New York.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.260
She said, if I thought the world would be like that, I commit suicide.

21:53.260 --> 21:54.380
I said, don't, don't.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.160
The actor thinking that means you're going to vote right

21:57.160 --> 21:59.740
and work for this world will not appeal.

22:00.180 --> 22:02.160
That's a science fiction admonishing finger again,

22:02.400 --> 22:03.780
saying shape up or ship out.

22:04.140 --> 22:05.280
If you don't do this, you'll get that.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.600
Make Room, Make Room is also a mystery novel.

22:09.040 --> 22:13.160
Harrison shows this vehicle because it allowed him to show society from bottom to top.

22:13.780 --> 22:17.320
All of science fiction, for the most part, is based on detective plot.

22:17.860 --> 22:19.160
The mystery, will it be solved?

22:19.780 --> 22:23.420
Even if they're not called like Hell, Clemens, Needle, not officially a mystery,

22:24.100 --> 22:25.460
you want to find out how you got that way?

22:25.560 --> 22:28.040
Will they solve the problem? Will they all live? Will they get all this world?

22:28.360 --> 22:29.000
Will they do it?

22:29.340 --> 22:33.600
That was the deliberate bit of my plot, a plot device of mine

22:33.600 --> 22:37.460
that I wanted to show society from the lowest level to the high.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.660
I wanted to show how everybody lived in that world.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.680
So I used a very simple device of having a detective as a protagonist.

22:43.480 --> 22:44.340
A very simple story.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.560
And we all know from the beginning who did the murder.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.300
We knew what was going to happen.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.960
And it was not important, but it was a device to move the story along.

22:52.340 --> 22:55.120
And like most crimes in New York, 9% aren't solved.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.000
Just by chance that they are.

22:57.380 --> 23:00.260
This is a way of getting you into the various levels of the strategy of society.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.180
On our next show, we'll talk about Soilent Green.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.960
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

23:15.960 --> 23:19.140
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

24:06.440 --> 24:10.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:26.340 --> 24:31.580
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.940
And here are your hosts.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.440
This is Bill Vernon.

24:41.640 --> 24:42.200
And Daryl Lane.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.400
Make Room, Make Room.

24:43.660 --> 24:47.340
Harry Harrison's grim novel of an overpopulated near future New York

24:47.340 --> 24:49.560
was the basis for the movie Soilent Green.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.380
This movie made its appearance in the early 1970s,

24:52.420 --> 24:54.420
and it starred Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson.

24:54.880 --> 24:59.360
One of the movie's claims to fame is that it was the last motion picture Edward G. Robinson played in.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.700
We spoke with Harrison about the transformation of the novel to the movie,

25:03.080 --> 25:06.540
and we were particularly interested how the movie came to be plotted around cannibalism,

25:06.680 --> 25:08.140
whereas this was never mentioned in the novel.

25:08.140 --> 25:13.000
Harrison told us an interesting story which vividly shows how things apparently work in Hollywood.

25:13.880 --> 25:18.460
The first time I heard about the fact that they wanted to make a film out of this book

25:18.460 --> 25:21.160
was when I approached for a contract and I signed it,

25:21.520 --> 25:25.120
and then it turned out the firm that bought it was a front for MGM,

25:25.760 --> 25:27.220
and they sold MGM for one dollar.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.340
They hate to pay the writer a decent fee,

25:29.420 --> 25:30.800
but for some reason they pay everyone else.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.160
They don't like to pay writers in Hollywood.

25:32.160 --> 25:40.100
And it turned out that the producer Walter Zeltzer and lead actor Chuck Heston

25:40.100 --> 25:42.440
have been trying to sell MGM for five years,

25:43.020 --> 25:47.700
and they couldn't sell MGM for that overpopulation wasn't important enough to a film on.

25:48.200 --> 25:52.320
So they then got a moronic screenwriter who put in cannibalism.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.400
He thought they'd eat that up in MGM, and they did.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.180
They thought it'd be a great idea for a film.

25:57.380 --> 25:59.180
It was bought as a cannibalism film.

26:00.220 --> 26:03.020
And I saw the screenplay and it was pretty atrocious,

26:03.240 --> 26:04.200
and I could not do anything.

26:04.340 --> 26:06.480
By contract I couldn't change one word.

26:07.060 --> 26:10.080
So what I did do, I kept saying on memos what was wrong physically,

26:10.340 --> 26:12.620
how it could not work, and they made a lot of changes.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.760
I went down the set and pointed out things that hadn't been done,

26:16.200 --> 26:19.240
and I gave copies of the book to all the actors and all the technical people,

26:19.300 --> 26:20.160
and they got very interested.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.380
And I talked to Eddie Robinson.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.260
I remember he talked to Dick Fleischer.

26:27.260 --> 26:30.540
I heard him say, I don't understand who I'm supposed to be, what is this role?

26:31.280 --> 26:33.700
And there's no way of talking that rotten screenplay what it was.

26:34.180 --> 26:36.180
So I asked if I could talk to him.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.360
I introduced myself, and we had lunch.

26:38.820 --> 26:39.460
I said, I wrote the book.

26:39.620 --> 26:40.280
Oh, that's very interesting.

26:40.440 --> 26:41.940
The Literate Man, the art collector, you know?

26:42.460 --> 26:50.400
I explained that in the book in the year 2000, that is me, my army record, my age.

26:51.420 --> 26:56.360
The hero there, not here, the old man is the only person who knew the good world as it was playing.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.840
He said, the only person who lived when the world was green.

26:59.260 --> 27:00.300
He said, that's a good idea.

27:00.520 --> 27:00.980
It's not bad.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.780
Having got that much, he went away and acted.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.860
A lot of that was created on camera,

27:07.720 --> 27:09.920
the interface between the director and the actors.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.460
And I like to think myself, that was there all the time.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.100
And I like to feel, A, it was my book,

27:15.580 --> 27:18.320
and B, if there was some worth in the film, I helped to add to it.

27:35.760 --> 27:41.100
One of the lead characters, the old man Saul, played by Robinson, is actually Harrison in 1999, as he mentioned.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.100
Here he explains.

27:43.020 --> 27:46.060
To keep him in the three-dimensional character, I guess, I use myself when I'll be of that age.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.460
I don't want to live in that world.

27:47.620 --> 27:48.320
That's why I wrote the book.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.340
I do not want to be that person at that time.

28:05.440 --> 28:09.500
Although the plot of make room, make room was significantly altered in Soylent Green,

28:09.980 --> 28:12.740
Harrison told us that on the whole, he is pleased with the movie.

28:13.260 --> 28:16.420
The technical people were so tremendous, and the acting was so good.

28:17.180 --> 28:21.680
And it does what science fiction does so well, background as foreground.

28:22.220 --> 28:26.280
You go to see it, it's a stupid little detective plot, and you know it's going to be Bonnie's maid in Soylent Green.

28:26.880 --> 28:30.760
And then about a week later, you start thinking about that horrible world, that green world you're living in.

28:31.000 --> 28:31.680
My God!

28:32.080 --> 28:33.260
And it succeeds in that play.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.680
It was sort of a shocker, an emotional shocker.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.000
It works.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.320
I think it works pretty well as a film.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.440
There have been no complaints.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.940
It's the only film MGM made money on that year.

28:42.380 --> 28:46.740
That was the year the Great Walls bombed, it cost $14 million, and grossed $500,000.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.340
So MGM should be happy, and Reston should be happy.

28:50.340 --> 28:51.180
I can't complain.

28:52.140 --> 28:55.360
Be sure to catch Soylent Green next time it plays on late night television.

29:02.860 --> 29:08.240
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

29:08.540 --> 29:11.500
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.480
Thank you.
