Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.960
And here are your hosts.

00:42.060 --> 00:50.620
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. Science fiction writer George R.R. Martin
recently had his third novel, Fevre Dream, published in hardcover by Poseidon

00:50.620 --> 00:58.360
Press. Fevre Dream is a science fictional historical horror novel which combines
the vampire legend and Mississippi riverboats in the antebellum south. We asked

00:58.360 --> 01:06.580
Martin why he chose to write about a combination of vampires and riverboats. The
vampires came first as I was putting the book together. I had read a fair amount

01:06.580 --> 01:15.700
about vampires. I had read other people's vampire novels as far as Dracula and
some of the other books done recently. And I had wanted to do my own version of

01:15.700 --> 01:26.760
that legend for some time because I had a few ideas about it. But I didn't want
it to be just another Dracula book, just another rehash of the same old legend.

01:26.760 --> 01:35.120
Because we've seen vampire books after vampire books that are essentially just
the same thing spun over and over again. And I think that's a little tiresome.

01:35.860 --> 01:44.460
And at the same time I was going through all these thoughts about vampires was
the period that I was living in Dubuque, Iowa. I taught college there for three

01:44.460 --> 01:53.240
years. And Dubuque, of course, is an old river town. It was once a big steamboat
manufacturing center. And it's still very much imbued with the whole history of

01:53.240 --> 02:05.760
the great era of steam on the Mississippi. So it was during that period while I
was in Dubuque that I got interested in that period of history. I got interested

02:05.760 --> 02:14.380
in the steamboats. I read a fair amount about them. And once I did, the two
things just seemed to come together in my mind. And there's a certain

02:14.380 --> 02:27.040
romanticism, I think, a dark romanticism that clings to both the old steamboats
and vampires. They're both very attractive in a certain sense. The elegant

02:27.040 --> 02:35.200
vampire and the stately, intricate, gorgeous steamboat. But they also have dark
sides, too, of course.

02:45.280 --> 02:53.500
In Fevre Dream, the protagonist, Captain Abner Marsh, owner of a failing
steamboat company, the Fevre River Packet Line, realizes his lifelong dream of

02:53.500 --> 03:01.260
captaining a fast, luxurious steamboat when he becomes partners with the
mysterious Joshua York. All Marsh has to do to maintain the partnership and keep

03:01.260 --> 03:09.000
the fancy steamboat is sail up and down the river and avoid questioning York's
somewhat odd habits. But York begins bringing aboard a strange retinue of

03:09.000 --> 03:16.580
acquaintances, all of whom have nocturnal habits. And, of course, Marsh has
difficulty staying his curiosity. As Marsh learns about York and his friends, he

03:16.580 --> 03:25.340
discovers they are vampires. But Martin presents vampires in a manner never seen
in fantasy. He explains them in rational terms. This meant including some of the

03:25.340 --> 03:34.140
legendary characteristics of vampires, but leaving others out. I wanted to have
rationalized vampires. I wanted to have vampires that I thought could actually

03:34.140 --> 03:46.340
exist, that were not based on, you know, vague supernatural legends handed down
over the years. So I had to look at each of the particular beliefs associated

03:46.340 --> 03:56.080
with vampires and see if there is any way that I could justify this in a
rational manner. Now, obviously, something about vampires not coming out during

03:56.080 --> 04:07.020
day, which the vampires in my book, Fevre Dream, do have that characteristic.
Well, that's very easily explainable. It's just they're nocturnal creatures.

04:08.160 --> 04:20.980
Their skin is extremely sensitive to ultraviolet, so they burn very badly if
they're exposed to daylight. So they avoid it. You can justify that easily. But

04:20.980 --> 04:28.540
you look at something, they're not reflected in mirrors. I mean, there's no way
to justify not being reflected in mirrors scientifically. You have to rewrite,

04:28.760 --> 04:37.500
essentially, all the laws governing light and reflection and refraction and so
on. That's strictly a supernatural motif, so I had to get rid of that.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.760
Obviously, considering that the book is about vampires on Mississippi River
steamboats, I had to get rid of the one that said they can't cross running water

04:46.760 --> 04:53.560
as well, since they sail up and down the steamboat all through the book. More on

06:14.520 --> 06:19.800
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.160
And here are your hosts.

06:28.300 --> 06:36.400
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon. Science fiction writer George R.R. Martin's
latest novel, Fevre Dream, a science fictional historical horror effort, was

06:36.400 --> 06:43.380
recently published in hardcover by Poseidon Press and distributed by Simon &
Schuster. As we discussed in our last show, the book combines elements of the

06:43.380 --> 06:52.480
vampire legend and a Mark Twain-like presentation of Mississippi riverboat lore.
Joshua York, the partner of Captain Abner Marsh, is a vampire who has managed to

06:52.480 --> 06:59.380
concoct a potion which will alleviate the red thirst. The scourge which visits
the vampires in Martin's novel periodically and drives them into an

06:59.380 --> 07:07.200
uncontrollable state of bloodlust, which can only be satiated by human blood,
preferably that from young, attractive, living humans. The humans, by the way,

07:07.260 --> 07:15.760
are deprecatingly referred to by some of the vampires as cattle. The existence
of the potion is the key to Martin's novel. It gives the vampires a choice. They

07:15.760 --> 07:22.420
can continue feasting on the blood of the cattle, or they can finally quit
terrorizing the human race and drink only the artificial brew. This choice is

07:22.420 --> 07:30.440
another element which separates Martin's vampires from those of traditional
fantasy. I suppose as much as anything else, I mean, the book is about vampires

07:30.440 --> 07:40.000
on Mississippi river steamboats, but in a deeper sense, it's about moral
choices. And one of the things that Joshua York, the vampire, says to Abner,

07:40.280 --> 07:46.280
Abner Marsh, the protagonist, and that Abner later says back to him is, You make
your choices.

08:14.660 --> 08:22.980
It's a real world, but it's a real world kind of a hollow construct. The real
world is made up of greys. I think real people are made up of greys. We don't

08:22.980 --> 08:33.440
have absolute goods, and we don't have absolute evils. The good and evil that we
have, you know, resides in each of us, and it is a matter of moral choice. Damon

08:33.440 --> 08:41.060
Julian is a charismatic elder vampire who rejects the potion. He did make a
choice eons ago, but he also makes the choice in terms of the book at the

08:41.060 --> 08:44.960
banquet when he essentially rejects what Joshua has to offer.

08:48.480 --> 09:02.060
And states his opposition to Joshua with saying, you know, we are born, this is
what we are born to be, masters of humanity, people who take the lives of those

09:02.060 --> 09:14.100
inferior to us. And this is our nature. So he is making a choice there. He's
rejecting Joshua's potion. He's rejecting the freedom from the red thirst that

09:14.100 --> 09:25.580
Joshua offers, and he's accepting what he thinks is of his superior nature.
Martin told us that he found a close parallel between Julian's view of the human

09:25.580 --> 09:36.080
race and slavery as it existed in the South at the time of the book, 1857. Of
course, there's also certain, you know, resonances there with the whole slavery

09:36.080 --> 09:47.640
thing, which I tried to put through all the way through the book. It takes place
in the antebellum South, late antebellum South, and slavery issue, of course, is

09:47.640 --> 09:59.140
very hot then. And the whole master-slave thing that existed between blacks and
whites in the South then has a kind of fantasy reflection in relations between

09:59.140 --> 10:10.840
vampires. And human beings. This parallel even strikes Abner Marsh as the story
progresses. Abner Marsh is never an evil man. I think by nature he is a good

10:10.840 --> 10:21.920
man. But he is a man at the beginning of the book who is essentially just living
his own life. And the great moral issues of his time, like slavery, are, you

10:21.920 --> 10:28.340
know, things he kind of hashes out over the dinner table but never has any great
personal involvement in.

10:31.480 --> 10:39.960
But as a result of the whole experience with the steamer Fevre Dream and the
things that happen to him, I think Marsh changes and becomes, in essence, a man

10:39.960 --> 10:46.200
who is much more aware of the necessity to make moral choices. More on George
Martin's Fevre Dream on our next show.

12:07.040 --> 12:12.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:15.020 --> 12:16.720
And here are your hosts.

12:20.920 --> 12:29.180
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. Science Fiction author George R.R. Martin's
latest novel is Fevre Dream, a science fictional historical horror story about

12:29.180 --> 12:37.640
vampires in Mississippi river boats. Here Martin explains the title of the book.
The title of the book is taken from the name of the steamboat in the book. The

12:37.640 --> 12:45.080
Fevre Dream is named the steamboat. And the reason Abner Marsh names the
steamboat the Fevre Dream is because it is the boat he has always dreamed of

12:45.080 --> 12:55.360
having, the grand, luxurious, fast steamer. And because he is the president, his
company is called Fevre River Package Company, with that odd spelling, the R-E

12:55.360 --> 13:05.600
inverted. Okay, that explains the origin of Fevre Dream. But where did the oddly
spelled fevre originate? It has to do with Captain Marsh's birthplace. He was

13:05.600 --> 13:18.820
born in Galena, Illinois. And the river Galena is located on a small tributary
that comes off the Mississippi, which originally was named the Fevre River, F-E

13:18.820 --> 13:31.140
-V-R-E River, in the early 1800s. And Marsh, of course, was born during that
period and grew up calling it. And in point of fact, and this is all

13:31.140 --> 13:41.780
historically true, the name of that river was changed to the Galena River fairly
early on because, you know, the town got respectable and they didn't want people

13:41.780 --> 13:49.580
thinking they were all sick there. So they thought it would be better to call it
the Galena River. But Galena was a very important steamboat town. And the Fevre

13:49.580 --> 13:58.720
in its early days, today it's nothing but a creek. It's completely silted up and
I've visited it and you couldn't get a rowboat up it, let alone a major steamer.

13:59.060 --> 14:11.280
But in the early 1800s, Galena was a major steamboat port. And the Fevre, or the
Galena River, as it later became, was a very bustling little tributary indeed.

14:12.000 --> 14:20.380
We asked Martin if there were actual steamboats as fast and as luxurious as the
Fevre Dream. The dimensions of the Fevre Dream and the capacity of her engines

14:20.380 --> 14:31.060
and so forth are modeled very closely on the Eclipse. In terms of the book, the
Eclipse is the queen of the river, the fastest, largest, and most luxurious

14:31.060 --> 14:41.000
boat. And it's the one Abner Marsh aspires to displace as fastest steamer on the
river, and that's why he built the Fevre Dream. The Eclipse was a real

14:41.000 --> 14:54.640
historical boat of its era, the 1850s, and was considered the fastest boat of
that era. It did indeed win a very famous steamboat race against the Shotwell.

14:57.080 --> 15:07.760
And some people, including Mark Twain, put forward evidence that the Fevre Dream
was in fact the fastest steamer ever on the river. And there were later steamers

15:07.760 --> 15:19.000
in the 1870s and the 1880s that, while they were not perhaps as fast as the
Fevre Dream in the book or the Eclipse in real life, were even more luxurious,

15:19.360 --> 15:33.380
like the J.M. White, a very fast and incredibly luxurious steamer of the 1870s,
1880s. One of the interesting facts that strikes the reader is that riverboats

15:33.380 --> 15:43.220
were extremely short-lived. That was one of the interesting things that turned
up when I was researching it that kind of startled me, too. I mean, they're such

15:43.220 --> 15:59.320
formidable-looking structures. You'd think they'd be around for ages. But, in
fact, they had a shorter lifespan than the modern car. Martin had to do

15:59.320 --> 16:08.280
considerable research on steamboats to ensure the accuracy of the historical
details in Fevre Dream. It took me two years to do Fevre Dream altogether. The

16:08.280 --> 16:18.320
first year of that was largely research. So a lot of research did go into it,
yes. I think that's a necessity if you're going to do justice to any sort of

16:18.320 --> 16:30.240
historical fiction. Fevre Dream, of course, is historical horror, but I still
think you owe your readers that debt of accuracy insofar as you're capable of

16:30.240 --> 16:32.860
it. More with George Martin on our next show.

17:55.400 --> 18:00.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:03.380 --> 18:05.000
And here are your hosts.

18:09.060 --> 18:16.800
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon. One of the most popular genres in mass
market literature is the horror genre. We asked science fiction author George R

18:16.800 --> 18:25.400
.R. Martin, author of the recently published horror novel Fevre Dream, why he
thinks the horror genre is currently so successful. I think people may be going

18:25.400 --> 18:38.900
to horror because it's... In horror novels, we're scared, yeah, but we can kind
of control the scares. And, you know, we can read the book and scare ourselves.

18:39.960 --> 18:46.220
But then we put down the book and we know that what we're afraid of, vampires,
werewolves, haunted hotels, whatever,

18:49.200 --> 19:01.620
is not real. And people don't mind dealing with that and kind of getting a
little catharsis out of that. But they don't want to deal with real, the real

19:01.620 --> 19:14.080
terrifying things, violence in the streets and crime and crazed psychos out
there and the threat of nuclear holocaust and all of the other more real fears

19:14.080 --> 19:22.100
that also hang over us. So I think that may be part of it. There are many
creatures that embody horror in the literature. Ghosts, monsters, ghouls,

19:22.180 --> 19:29.040
werewolves, witches. But probably the most enduring image of horror is the
vampire, the nocturnal stalker who drinks the blood of its unwary victims. The

19:29.040 --> 19:38.280
vampire legend spans many cultures. Here Martin tells us about the vampire
legend and the reasons why the legend may be so popular even now. Vampires are

19:38.280 --> 19:48.800
an almost universal legend, which is one thing that turned out when I was
researching Fevre Dream. The vampires we're familiar with, of course, Dracula

19:48.800 --> 20:00.100
and his kin, so to speak, and all the books that are derived from that tradition
are essentially retreads of Eastern European, Romanian, Hungarian, largely

20:00.100 --> 20:10.860
vampire legends. But if you look around the world, you'll find vampire legends
everywhere. In China, in Africa, in the South Seas, there are variants of the

20:10.860 --> 20:23.760
vampire legend. The details differ. But the basic vision of a nocturnal predator
that preys on human beings is present in all of these. And so that would lead

20:23.760 --> 20:36.480
you to wonder why do they have this universal appeal. The easy answer as to why
they're appealing in our culture today, in modern American mass society, I

20:36.480 --> 20:50.800
think, is the sexual nature of the vampire, the sexual symbolism embodied in
Dracula and in the way it's been treated by Hollywood sense, the symbolism of

20:50.800 --> 20:52.140
vampire as seductor,

20:59.700 --> 21:12.360
appeals to something within us and gives legend a lot more resonances than, say,
the werewolf legend or zombies or some of the other things that have never

21:12.360 --> 21:24.520
really achieved the popularity of the vampire legend. But then you could say,
well, that's true for us, but it doesn't explain why the legend is so universal

21:24.520 --> 21:27.940
around the world. And indeed it doesn't, and I don't have an answer for that.

21:45.520 --> 21:53.640
Martin tells us here how he incorporated this universal, transcultural concept
of the vampire in Fevre Dream. In terms of Fevre Dream, I looked at that

21:53.640 --> 22:02.340
universality and I made it one of the bases when I started writing the novel. I
said, what if the reason that these legends are universal is because they're all

22:02.340 --> 22:15.920
remembering the same thing? They're all remembering some kind of racial memory
of a real man-like predatory animal, blood drinker, that is somehow the basis

22:15.920 --> 22:20.040
for all the vampire legends. And that was the premise that I, of course, used in
Fevre Dream.
