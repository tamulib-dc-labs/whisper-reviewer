WEBVTT

00:01.840 --> 00:05.400
Okay, you've written some other fancy which we'll talk about, but the thing we want to

00:05.400 --> 00:11.680
talk about first, which is probably what we'll make the main programs on, is the fuzzy stuff,

00:12.440 --> 00:12.960
is that appropriate?

00:13.640 --> 00:15.500
Could you give us some background about it?

00:15.560 --> 00:16.120
I know H.B.

00:16.300 --> 00:21.740
Piper wrote about the fuzzies first of all, and how is it that other people are now writing

00:21.740 --> 00:22.740
about it, that sort of thing?

00:22.820 --> 00:28.880
What's the flow of how that worked, and then how did you get interested in writing fuzzy

00:28.880 --> 00:29.320
material?

00:29.320 --> 00:42.780
Well, Mr. Piper died in 1966, a suicide, which was a very tragic thing, and he left a considerable

00:42.780 --> 00:44.140
literary estate.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.040
He had been writing rather successfully for a long time.

00:49.200 --> 00:58.980
There was sort of a hiatus there for a number of years, until one of his friends, I believe

00:58.980 --> 01:05.600
had aced to purchase his literary estate, all the rights and all of his books and short

01:05.600 --> 01:08.020
stories and everything, which they did.

01:09.880 --> 01:19.320
And they reissued little fuzzy and fuzzy sapiens in a single volume under the fuzzy papers,

01:19.460 --> 01:21.020
and it was very successful.

01:21.600 --> 01:27.920
It had a built-in market of people who remembered the books, and so they decided that they wanted

01:27.920 --> 01:33.940
another book, so they turned to Mr. William Tuning, who wrote a third book, Fuzzy Bones,

01:35.700 --> 01:37.280
which I enjoyed very much.

01:37.720 --> 01:43.860
I based a great deal of the background of my book on the substructure that he had created

01:43.860 --> 01:45.800
for their historical background.

01:48.480 --> 01:55.320
And then, I believe it was Susan Allison, who was then the head science fiction editor

01:55.320 --> 02:00.540
at ACE, decided that they wanted a book from the viewpoint of the little aliens.

02:02.190 --> 02:13.780
Well, my editor had just bought paperback rights to my first two double-day books, and

02:13.780 --> 02:19.880
she was in the process of putting them into production for ACE, and she had had a great

02:19.880 --> 02:25.720
deal of back-and-forth conversation with my agent, who is still black-staggered at how

02:25.720 --> 02:27.300
fast I am.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.160
And so one day the phone rang, that dear phone.

02:31.800 --> 02:32.680
It was Susan Allison.

02:33.540 --> 02:39.060
She said, Would you be interested in writing a book to continue H.B.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.360
Piper's Fuzzy Series?

02:40.560 --> 02:41.560
Are you familiar with mine?

02:41.720 --> 02:43.260
I said, Yes, I've got my teeth on them.

02:43.820 --> 02:45.140
And she said, Well, would you be interested?

02:45.460 --> 02:47.740
We want one from the viewpoint of the aliens.

02:48.500 --> 02:54.840
And she said, I shouldn't say this, but we were kicking it around the office and trying

02:54.840 --> 02:58.620
to figure who was extremely fast and partly alien, and naturally we thought of you.

02:59.320 --> 03:03.680
Well, I was flat, you know, because I am both.

03:06.280 --> 03:13.420
So I said, Well, I'll tell you what, I will reread the books, and then I will write whatever

03:13.420 --> 03:19.920
feels comfortable so that I know how well I fit into a fuzzy skin, and you will be able

03:19.920 --> 03:21.760
to tell how well you like what I do.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.780
And then we'll go from there.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.200
So this was in early February.

03:26.400 --> 03:31.680
So I sat down, and it's a very funny thing.

03:31.780 --> 03:37.100
Becoming an alien is not all that difficult, but you have to have been a very peculiar

03:37.100 --> 03:40.240
child to be able to do it well.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.300
So I remembered when I was two feet tall.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.820
I can remember back before I was two years old.

03:47.260 --> 03:51.540
I remembered how the world is full of shoes and kneecaps.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.900
You know, everything is tremendous.

03:55.440 --> 03:59.040
Shrubs or trees and trees are just something up there like clouds.

03:59.500 --> 04:07.640
So I shrunk myself down to two feet tall and put myself on a world where everything thought

04:07.640 --> 04:11.340
I was delicious and went from there.

04:12.260 --> 04:21.840
Because the treatment of the fuzzies in both paper and cuning books is rather peripheral

04:21.840 --> 04:29.860
to the human story, and the fuzzies are given rather short shrift as sort of cutesy poo

04:30.380 --> 04:30.840
creatures.

04:31.680 --> 04:38.480
Okay, Mr. Tuning had set up that they had survived on this totally inimical planet for

04:38.480 --> 04:40.220
1,200 years.

04:41.290 --> 04:46.100
So little helpless big eyed cutesy poos don't survive for 1,200 years.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.760
You've got to have pretty bright, gritty little cats, or they're not going to make it.

04:51.900 --> 04:59.660
Well, I had some awfully neat questions to answer that had been set up in the other books

04:59.660 --> 05:02.840
and had never been addressed in those books.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.540
Why did they speak in ultrasonics?

05:07.560 --> 05:16.680
Why being obviously rational creatures capable of great affection were they sexually promiscuous?

05:17.900 --> 05:23.220
Oh, there were any number of questions that I had to answer.

05:23.300 --> 05:29.360
It was so funny because as I went, I just turned, okay, this is what they are.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.420
And I turn around and look when this is obviously the reason they were that way.

05:33.940 --> 05:41.960
They were sexually promiscuous, for instance, because when their spaceship crashed, a complement

05:41.960 --> 05:44.700
of only some 400 were aboard.

05:45.880 --> 05:50.180
And some half of those were subsequently killed in an earthquake.

05:51.280 --> 05:57.540
So you had a gene pool shared among something around 150 or 200 individuals.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.180
You had to spread your genetic heritage around.

06:03.880 --> 06:08.280
And so this would be a natural outgrowth of assigned breeding as long as they were in

06:08.280 --> 06:09.820
the original valley.

06:10.220 --> 06:16.280
And then when they went out, they retained this imperative from their leaders, you must

06:16.280 --> 06:18.140
do this for racial survival.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.320
There were any number of things like that.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.120
Anyhow, they loved what I did.

06:23.340 --> 06:24.420
I loved what I did.

06:24.420 --> 06:28.540
I wrote that book, 100,000 words in six weeks.

06:30.780 --> 06:36.600
I sat on a wicker stool, which is now permanently imprinted on my

06:37.300 --> 06:37.860
derriere.

06:41.640 --> 06:45.980
My husband would come in, he would have left me sitting on the stool that morning.

06:46.080 --> 06:50.680
He'd come in that evening and say, you haven't eaten, have you?

06:51.260 --> 06:52.460
I say, eaten?

06:52.800 --> 06:53.280
What's eaten?

06:55.580 --> 06:57.560
But it was a lot of fun.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.540
Of course it took them six months to produce my contract.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.520
But it took a long to get the money to.

07:04.940 --> 07:05.940
Much longer.

07:06.180 --> 07:06.760
Much longer.

07:07.340 --> 07:09.080
Are there going to be more coming from you?

07:10.500 --> 07:12.440
I really don't know.

07:13.520 --> 07:18.740
In the middle of all this, one of the hitches with the contract was the fact that Berkeley

07:19.360 --> 07:20.600
bought Ace.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.200
And this queried all sorts of deals.

07:26.620 --> 07:34.100
They had projected 100,000 printing with a $50,000 ad campaign behind it.

07:35.080 --> 07:40.100
Well there had been a couple of good full page ads, one in Locust, one in Publishers

07:40.100 --> 07:42.100
Weekly, a few around different places.

07:42.940 --> 07:46.020
They gave it a better start than it would have had.

07:46.020 --> 07:51.920
But then when the title passed to Berkeley, they cut the printing to $55,000 and they

07:51.920 --> 07:54.740
saw it off the ad campaign, right in its tracks.

07:55.880 --> 08:01.000
And now they are saying, the book has only been out since October, you understand.

08:01.340 --> 08:05.480
It was on the Locust trade paperback bestseller list for two months in succession.

08:07.340 --> 08:13.480
But when I asked my editor up there if they would be interested in a proposal for another,

08:14.320 --> 08:15.820
she said, well I would.

08:16.420 --> 08:21.340
But the powers that they are making, well this hasn't done very well, no, as she said.

08:21.660 --> 08:25.900
They don't care that it's their fault that it hasn't sold millions, they didn't print

08:25.900 --> 08:27.160
enough in the first place.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.080
And she said, we're just going to have to wait and see how the mass market edition

08:31.080 --> 08:32.800
does and that will be out in September.

08:34.840 --> 08:40.240
So just keep your fingers crossed that the mass market, I just wouldn't mind it all

08:40.240 --> 08:41.140
writing another one.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.760
You'd rather enjoy the...

08:42.760 --> 08:43.320
I did.

08:43.560 --> 08:44.620
They're nice little people.

08:44.820 --> 08:45.520
They really are.

08:45.960 --> 08:46.440
They're full.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.160
Yeah.

08:48.380 --> 08:52.860
The cover is one of the better covers, I think they were gorgeous.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.480
Did you have any input on that or were you just pleasantly surprised?

08:57.100 --> 09:01.940
No, but I knew it was going to be beautiful because Mike Whalen had done the covers for

09:01.940 --> 09:04.740
the Piper books and for the tuning book.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.620
And so I knew what he could do.

09:06.620 --> 09:11.040
It was funny when the Ace Trade catalog came out last fall.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.820
Golden Dream was the lead book.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.020
It had a double page color spread.

09:17.760 --> 09:24.000
But this had been such a hurry up project that Mike had not yet completed the cover

09:24.000 --> 09:29.320
painting and they had to fake the cover painting and use it back off one of the old books for

09:29.320 --> 09:32.460
it, which is sort of funny.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.720
If I remember right, this is just a trivia thing.

09:35.720 --> 09:42.000
I think when they went out the fuzzy pages, they had a man kneeling down with a gun and

09:42.000 --> 09:42.480
some fuzzy.

09:42.620 --> 09:45.260
That was H.B. Piper, as I understand it.

09:45.260 --> 09:47.180
Yeah, I think it was supposed to be.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.520
That's what he looked like.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.440
I was always struck by that.

09:51.900 --> 09:58.460
I always had the feeling that H.B. Piper modeled Jack Holloway, who was the discoverer of the

09:58.460 --> 09:59.340
fuzzies on himself.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.620
It just felt that way.

10:03.320 --> 10:03.920
Yeah.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.720
Okay, let's talk about what else you've done.

10:08.040 --> 10:16.060
If you could give us titles and kind of what genre and what your literary aim is when you're writing them.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.500
Okay, well let me give you titles first because that's sort of a long project by itself.

10:21.560 --> 10:22.060
All right.

10:22.320 --> 10:28.400
Okay, in 1979, Double Day published How the Gods Wove in Curana.

10:29.060 --> 10:30.100
Better spell that.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.640
K-Y-R-A-N-N-O-N.

10:33.800 --> 10:40.440
Somebody said, your rule is I take it that there must be one unpronounceable word in every title.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.680
And I hadn't realized that, so I'm trying to do better.

10:45.060 --> 10:51.960
In 80, Double Day brought out The Seekers of Charanun, which is S-H-A-R-N-U-H-N.

10:54.640 --> 11:01.960
81 brought Soul Singer of Ternos, T-Y-R-N-O-S from Athenaeum.

11:05.100 --> 11:08.480
82 busted loose like a pot of popcorn.

11:10.500 --> 11:14.800
Warlock's gift came from Double Day in the spring.

11:17.660 --> 11:23.580
Paperback reprints from Ace of How the Gods Wove in Seekers of Charanun came out that spring.

11:26.860 --> 11:30.940
Runes of the Liar came out from Athenaeum that fall.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.860
And Golden's L-Y-R-E.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.200
And Golden Dream of Fuzzy Odyssey came out that fall.

11:41.200 --> 11:48.460
So it sort of just grabbed you up like a tornado and carried you away spinning.

11:50.900 --> 11:55.420
I write a great many other things besides science fiction and fantasy.

11:56.260 --> 12:00.860
I read eclectically and always have.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.860
In Britain Westerns, I have two Westerns out to market.

12:04.860 --> 12:12.240
And two more in various stages of disarray, which I will finish if and when I sell the first two.

12:12.920 --> 12:16.460
I've written an occult horror novel.

12:17.260 --> 12:21.740
I have written a very strange suspense novel.

12:23.000 --> 12:34.580
I've written a peculiar little novel about a child who visualized an imaginary pet.

12:35.900 --> 12:44.700
And thereby created a tulpa, which is something that is not too well known in the West.

12:45.020 --> 12:46.920
It's a Tibetan.

12:48.820 --> 12:59.220
Actually, it's a middle exercise in which you visualize something so concretely that other people can see it.

13:00.760 --> 13:08.120
According to my sources, an English woman in the middle of the 1800s created a tulpa.

13:08.320 --> 13:13.540
It traveled with her and innkeepers would serve it meals even though it couldn't eat them.

13:14.100 --> 13:19.940
But tulpa have a very strange quirk.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.800
They tend to get nastier and nastier.

13:22.920 --> 13:26.040
I mean, you can just visualize them as sweet as all get-out.

13:26.040 --> 13:30.700
But somewhere down the line, if they stick around, they get nasty and you have to un-make them.

13:31.380 --> 13:33.580
But of course, this was a small child.

13:34.100 --> 13:40.560
She was six years old and she didn't do it according to the rules because she was psychically talented and she just did it.

13:42.380 --> 13:47.320
And when Willoughby got nasty, she couldn't un-make it.

13:49.080 --> 13:57.600
And it takes her up to the point at which she's 26 years old and is suddenly and violently motivated,

13:58.480 --> 14:05.660
almost on a totally primitive level to un-make Willoughby, which she did.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.120
He attacked her mother.

14:08.320 --> 14:14.700
And this is a fun book that I haven't been able to get my agent to send out.

14:14.700 --> 14:18.660
For some reason, Willoughby bothers her and she never has sent it out to an editor.

14:18.960 --> 14:23.220
And I just keep champing at my bits and gnawing on my stubby fingernails.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.340
But all crazy.

14:26.540 --> 14:38.460
I just finished a book in which I combined an Onondaga warrior woman and dream magician with a 14th century adept,

14:38.460 --> 14:48.040
who has set a trans-dimensional trap in the Iroquois forest for his own purposes.

14:48.440 --> 14:56.640
And he pulls her across into a slightly time and space different but analogous England.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.900
And that was a lot of fun.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.280
I'm a language freak.

15:01.420 --> 15:02.980
I learned a lot of Onondaga.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.940
It doesn't have to be language.

15:06.180 --> 15:08.240
It's that anybody understands you understand.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.760
But Two Moons and the Black Tower.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.160
What's that when I send it off to my agent and I call her and I said,

15:16.160 --> 15:17.200
it's on its way.

15:17.500 --> 15:23.180
I don't know if it's saleable, but even if not, it has been worth every minute of it.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.360
I had just had a ball right in.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.320
That's the reason I do it, you know.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.240
It's so much fun.

15:30.240 --> 15:34.300
And I never know when I start a book what's going to happen any more than you do.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.300
Do you know at least what genre it's going to be?

15:37.880 --> 15:39.540
Not always.

15:39.900 --> 15:44.660
Now when I do a Western, I mean you have to put yourself in a Western mood to do a Western.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.320
I get more blood thirsty when I'm doing a Western.

15:52.780 --> 15:57.200
But sometimes, well when my agent calls me and said,

15:57.200 --> 16:00.600
look, if you write another fantasy, I can sell it.

16:00.800 --> 16:06.880
Well, and if I'm particularly hungry that then I'll sit down and start a fantasy.

16:07.160 --> 16:12.400
But ordinarily, I just sort of let them go with the flow and see what comes out.

16:13.500 --> 16:19.280
You mentioned you've written, if you've, you've written Westerns,

16:19.320 --> 16:21.900
science fiction, fantasy, an occult novel.

16:23.640 --> 16:29.320
Do you, are you writing, let's say, fantasy and science fiction now because it sells better?

16:29.480 --> 16:31.080
Or do you just write what you damn well please?

16:31.240 --> 16:31.840
I love it.

16:31.980 --> 16:32.420
I love it.

16:32.460 --> 16:34.740
I've always loved it ever since I was a girl.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.160
Hit my first one when I was 15 and never have looked back.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.400
Did you grow up in a small town farm, at least?

16:41.460 --> 16:45.600
I grew up on a farm near Nacogdoches.

16:47.360 --> 16:52.040
And Nacogdoches at that time was somewhere around 5,000.

16:52.880 --> 16:56.960
Had the world's worst paperback distributor.

16:58.080 --> 17:03.860
And one day on the newsstand popped up a merit's face in the abyss.

17:05.320 --> 17:10.440
And I had a quarter in my pocket, which was not always the case.

17:11.600 --> 17:14.840
Back then kids were even poorer than grown people.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.700
Glommed on to it with cries of joy.

17:18.840 --> 17:22.580
Took it home and read it with rockets going off in my head.

17:22.820 --> 17:24.260
Wow, this is mine.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.920
I can read it as many times as I want to.

17:28.520 --> 17:36.480
And nothing hit the stands that I didn't manage by hooker, by crook or chicken money or something to get from their own.

17:36.480 --> 17:41.720
But of course I read everything else all along.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.260
I read a lot of archaeology.

17:45.540 --> 17:56.660
I read a lot of mythology and psychiatry and psychology and anthropology and everything you think of.

17:57.320 --> 18:00.280
I love history.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.280
I love obscure history.

18:02.280 --> 18:07.560
I like neat things like Louis Spence's The History of Atlantis.

18:08.540 --> 18:15.600
I thought about forming a club of the people who have read The History of Atlantis.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.660
I found five so far.

18:20.740 --> 18:27.920
It sort of sorts out the sheep from the goats, you know, and unusual for a while.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.920
When you were growing up then you grew up on a farm.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.720
Were you a dreamer?

18:35.180 --> 18:37.200
I mean I realized you had to work hard too.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.380
Were you kind of a dreamer while you were working, thinking about it?

18:40.420 --> 18:41.520
Oh, it's the best thing.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.120
I was a poet of course when I was on the farm.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.440
And we went into the dirt, well we were dirt farmers to start with.

18:48.700 --> 18:51.800
The biggest old mule you ever saw taught me how to plow.

18:52.460 --> 18:56.320
The mules are the brightest people you will ever meet.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.980
They have very few distractions.

19:01.740 --> 19:09.440
And when I was 12 my dad started selling milk, grade C milk,

19:09.580 --> 19:14.320
which meant I came in from school every evening and scrubbed milk cans that had

19:14.320 --> 19:20.500
sat out for the side of the road full of milk until the truck came, had been taken to Houston,

19:21.260 --> 19:26.900
emptied, not rinsed out, and brought back to be left on the side of the road the next day.

19:27.600 --> 19:32.360
That's going to be deducted from my time in Hades if there's any justice at all.

19:33.920 --> 19:37.980
And then when I was 17 we built a dairy barn.

19:39.120 --> 19:45.340
And I mean we built a dairy barn with our own hands and went into the grade A dairy business.

19:45.340 --> 19:55.300
And a McCormick Deering double unit milker works in perfect IMS.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.720
I wrote 250 sonnets.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.500
I do my best thinking when my hands are busy.

20:05.920 --> 20:13.000
And I would milk and get stepped on and kicked and have cow tails stuck in my mouth.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.140
And I'd go ride on riding sonnets in my head.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.980
You have to be strange.

20:21.260 --> 20:23.500
You understand it's necessary.

20:23.760 --> 20:30.540
Besides which you know I can't think of anything better to take your mind off shoveling cow manure than riding sonnets.

20:30.740 --> 20:35.060
It's just about as far as you can take your head from what your hands are doing.

20:36.460 --> 20:44.740
This morning you were talking to us about the fact that you think that having written poetry really helped with your prose and your novels.

20:44.980 --> 20:47.160
So would you recount that for the tape?

20:47.660 --> 20:50.740
Oh yes. This is something that I tell people.

20:51.360 --> 20:59.640
I talk to a lot of college classes and I belong to a group that has beginners in it.

20:59.640 --> 21:08.780
And I tell them write poetry even if it's bad poetry because in poetry you don't have a novel's worth of elbow room.

21:08.940 --> 21:19.140
You can't use 25 wrong words to get across an idea that two perfect words will give with punch you know with real impact.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.440
Poetry takes the laziness out of it.

21:24.440 --> 21:32.540
It makes you search for the proper word, the proper phrase, the exact construction that conveys what you want to give.

21:36.180 --> 21:40.020
This is something sort of strange too. I never went to college.

21:41.920 --> 21:52.020
I got out of high school and oh I thought my English teacher was just going to die and dissolve because I wouldn't go to college.

21:53.280 --> 22:01.980
I had I think a 99 average for my entire senior year which was really not fair because I didn't work at it.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.660
And some of the guys who really worked should have gotten better grades than I did.

22:05.700 --> 22:11.420
But anyhow she said you're not going out to the dairy and stay there.

22:11.620 --> 22:15.580
And I said well I'm going out to the dairy whether or not I stay there.

22:15.620 --> 22:17.620
It just depends on what comes up the pike.

22:17.620 --> 22:22.720
But I'm going to go out there and I'm going to do what I like to do and think what I like to think.

22:23.060 --> 22:28.440
And learn what I like to learn and I'm not going to be programmed by some cotton picking professor.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.900
I was a very opinionated 17 year old.

22:34.680 --> 22:38.380
And so I did and I studied over the next 10 years.

22:39.200 --> 22:44.060
I learned first of all I learned self-discipline.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.960
Which is the most important thing a writer can learn.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.140
Then I studied six languages.

22:51.420 --> 22:53.360
I learned to read six languages.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.190
All sorts ofologies.

22:57.120 --> 23:01.940
Everything you can think of philosophy, philology, archeology, anthropology.

23:03.320 --> 23:06.080
Just everything I could get my hands on.

23:06.440 --> 23:11.480
And while I made $30 a month it didn't cost me anything to live.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.760
So I spent $30 a month on books.

23:14.060 --> 23:18.320
And you could buy a whale of a lot of books back in 1947 for $30.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.600
And we subscribed.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.800
My mother always had magazines coming.

23:25.020 --> 23:28.520
All kinds of magazines from Atlantic Monthly to Cosmopolitan.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.120
Which at that time was a literate magazine.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.240
And so we had a great deal of input.

23:36.500 --> 23:40.060
And then of course my parents were both college educated.

23:40.060 --> 23:46.320
They were both people with the guts to give up a good job and throw their hats over the windmill

23:46.320 --> 23:51.200
and go out and just make it or break it on a dirt farm.

23:52.020 --> 23:55.880
Which is neat though that nearly killed them when I did the same thing.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.080
Somehow the perspectives changed between $30 and $50.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.880
But I got a fantastic education.

24:05.260 --> 24:06.880
I admit there were holes in it.

24:06.880 --> 24:12.560
I never had too much grounding in mathematics.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.720
Though I like mathematics.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.300
Or lab sciences.

24:16.400 --> 24:23.080
In fact I never took biology because that year they offered Latin for the first time.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.120
And I was going to have Latin or die.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.460
And so I didn't get biology.

24:28.320 --> 24:35.580
But really that's a lot of fun because now I'm researching recombinant DNA in plant.

24:37.300 --> 24:37.840
Alteration.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.770
And it's just new worlds.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.460
It's like fantasy itself.

24:41.460 --> 24:44.720
So I'm having a wonderful time with it.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.600
I know you live on a farm now.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.820
Could you kind of go through a typical day?

24:52.020 --> 24:54.820
Let's not say one where you're writing a fuzzy book and sitting in your city.

24:55.380 --> 24:55.920
No.

24:56.340 --> 24:58.440
But what's a typical day for you?

24:59.700 --> 25:01.160
How do you work in the writing?

25:01.160 --> 25:04.660
Well, my husband and I get up at six.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.300
He has to go to town and open up his service station.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.640
So I get up and fix breakfast for him at six.

25:10.360 --> 25:13.200
And at eight fifteen comes the postman.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.640
So I'm standing there and watching dishes.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.720
Or I'm out there milking the cow.

25:18.180 --> 25:20.200
And I'm listening for the postman.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.280
You know when Snoopy is a vulture.

25:22.540 --> 25:24.920
When he's on top of his doghouse being a vulture.

25:25.260 --> 25:28.080
That's the way I am with the postman.

25:29.780 --> 25:36.560
I milked one of the cows and turned the five calves in on her and her partner.

25:37.180 --> 25:40.660
And ten feed the goats and feed the cats and feed the dogs.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.480
And then I get the mail and look through.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.720
And I got such interesting mail.

25:46.980 --> 25:50.260
A lot of days I begin my real work.

25:50.640 --> 25:57.240
Of course, in among this, I usually try to sweep the porch and straighten the stacks.

25:57.240 --> 26:00.820
I've discovered you don't have to clean your living room if you keep your stacks straight.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.980
So I straighten the stacks.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.640
Then I hit the typewriter about nine o'clock usually.

26:08.180 --> 26:11.180
And I may answer six letters before I start writing.

26:11.400 --> 26:20.060
But then I will usually write depending on what I am engaged in from three to seven hours.

26:21.360 --> 26:27.900
I can write a pretty fair size short story in two and a half, three hours.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.760
But if I'm working on a book then it's really hot.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.640
Well I'll go right on through the three thirty four o'clock sometime.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.140
And I'm one of these lucky people.

26:37.240 --> 26:38.040
I don't have to eat.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.060
I don't need to eat.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.100
So I don't get hungry.

26:41.180 --> 26:42.800
I don't have to interrupt myself.

26:42.800 --> 26:50.620
Well, and about three thirty or four though the goat starts yelling at the pin.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.460
I don't know why she yells at four o'clock.

26:53.660 --> 26:56.240
But she usually does and that wakes me up.

26:56.360 --> 27:01.440
And I think, you know, I don't know whether I can get my old bones up from here or not.

27:01.620 --> 27:06.160
I'd better try and see, you know, among much creaking and groaning.

27:06.160 --> 27:12.320
I've hoist myself off the stool and straighten out and uncrink back.

27:12.740 --> 27:22.360
And so that's then when I go out and oh I may dig in my garden or take a walk up our little road.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.920
I walk in the woods when it's not deer season.

27:26.140 --> 27:30.760
I have not much ambition to wind up as a head on somebody's wall.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.000
But we have a pretty nice woods up from us.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.480
So I may take a walk and get the kinks out of my bones.

27:37.680 --> 27:38.520
And time to get back.

27:38.700 --> 27:43.260
It's time to lick the cat all over again and milk the cows and put the calves on.

27:43.660 --> 27:46.780
Feed the goats and all that good stuff.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.140
And then it's time to cook supper for Papa.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.700
And he gets home about six thirty.

27:52.040 --> 27:55.740
And so we pretty well are ready to pack it in there.

27:55.820 --> 28:00.200
And we sit there very quietly and trade tidbits about our days.

28:00.200 --> 28:04.460
We usually turn on the television but it's just for...

28:04.960 --> 28:07.960
We're used to having children around.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.920
My husband had two children when we married.

28:11.440 --> 28:16.000
And when the last one left it just got so quiet.

28:16.500 --> 28:19.540
So we need some background noise.

28:20.420 --> 28:23.580
But sometimes we watch and sometimes we don't.

28:23.580 --> 28:26.040
But it's...

28:26.040 --> 28:30.180
Oh it would bore young people to death our lifestyle would.

28:30.460 --> 28:33.440
But we've been places and we've done things.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.060
And we've thrown our hats over the windmill two or three times.

28:36.260 --> 28:39.840
So we're pretty well ready to sit down and let our bones ache in peace.

28:41.020 --> 28:41.600
That's nice.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.860
This is really kind of a dirty question.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.340
I guess would you like to be in a situation you're in some urban environment.

28:50.340 --> 28:52.080
You don't have to milk the cows.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.840
You can just sit there and ride on there.

28:53.980 --> 28:56.120
Do you think this is an integral part of you?

28:56.940 --> 28:59.540
I am a peasant to my toenails.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.040
I am not happy.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.700
I have lived in town periodically.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.820
And I've been miserable every minute.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.320
Oh I had to live in Houston for sixteen months.

29:11.480 --> 29:12.500
I thought I'd die.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.280
In fact I think I would have died if we hadn't left.

29:18.580 --> 29:21.260
We've always had a little plot of ground.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.660
Maybe not but two acres but something.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.540
We've always had some kind of livestock.

29:26.560 --> 29:30.680
When spring comes if I can't get my hands at the dirt and make a garden.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.560
You just better buy a straight jacket and call the men in the white coats.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.260
Because I'm ready to go off.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.260
I do my best writing thinking in the garden.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.400
Or even milking the cow.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.100
The old head just keeps rolling right along.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.580
Do you have any questions?

29:50.200 --> 29:50.400
No?

29:50.800 --> 29:51.440
Wow.

29:52.260 --> 29:53.800
I think we've got a pretty little cover here.

29:56.660 --> 30:02.820
I guess I should ask just so when we write the introduction.

30:03.300 --> 30:06.720
The other books that you've written are by and large fantasy.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.640
By and large fantasy.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.920
Yeah, by and large fantasy.

30:10.920 --> 30:11.320
Yes.

30:11.590 --> 30:13.700
Romantic fantasy, adventure fantasy.

30:17.820 --> 30:21.200
It's really more toward heroic fantasy.

30:21.880 --> 30:25.940
Though not in the sword and sorcery type of thing.

30:26.140 --> 30:29.920
These are more people who are heroic.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.900
Not through physical strength or anything like that.

30:34.940 --> 30:37.700
But because of the press of circumstance and integrity.

30:38.980 --> 30:44.500
I try to write about the way people can be and often are.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.300
Realism is fine.

30:48.660 --> 30:49.980
I mean there's a place for that.

30:50.720 --> 31:03.120
But I have never seen that the cause of human enlightenment has been forwarded too much by depicting the absolute worst aspects of human nature.

31:03.940 --> 31:05.820
People can be noble.

31:05.980 --> 31:07.080
They can be courageous.

31:07.780 --> 31:10.060
And they very often are.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.660
So why not write about it?

31:14.220 --> 31:23.360
When you do research, you're talking about doing a thing about recombinant DNA and all the oligies that you're interested in.

31:24.020 --> 31:30.140
Do you by and large depend on your own resources or does Nakadoshis have a library which is helpful in your research?

31:30.600 --> 31:32.240
The university library there.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.280
I have two very good friends who work there.

31:34.280 --> 31:37.840
I don't get into Nakadoshis too terribly often.

31:38.060 --> 31:39.460
It's a 60 mile round trip.

31:40.240 --> 31:44.920
I do get in once a week to wash and get groceries and that sort of thing.

31:45.060 --> 31:51.680
But usually I have a shucklet and have to get all this done before it goes out.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.160
But these two friends, when I have something that I really need, they will look it up.

31:57.320 --> 32:02.240
They'll either photocopy it or check it out for me.

32:03.300 --> 32:06.820
And that's really a help because I can not even pop out of one of their houses.

32:07.400 --> 32:11.840
And not have to park and walk at our university.

32:12.020 --> 32:15.760
The parking problem is something and you have to walk about a mile to get where you go.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.880
The old knees are just not real good at that anymore.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.880
But I have a tremendous library on myself.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.840
And I keep adding to it all the time.

32:27.800 --> 32:31.080
I don't think a tornado could blow my house away.

32:31.180 --> 32:32.260
It's so heavy with books.

32:34.420 --> 32:40.100
So really ordinarily I can find almost anything I want there.

32:40.760 --> 32:48.360
Now this DNA project, I have a friend in Houston who is a science fiction writer.

32:48.540 --> 32:50.100
Her husband is an engineer at NASA.

32:50.320 --> 32:55.600
And of course they have access to tremendous technical libraries.

32:55.600 --> 33:00.380
And she Xeroxed me a great deal of stuff on the recombinant DNA.

33:00.580 --> 33:01.940
Did you realize something?

33:02.920 --> 33:13.480
As far as we can find, there has been no work done on the sub-cellular phenomenon

33:13.480 --> 33:16.920
that takes place when a plant goes dormant.

33:17.840 --> 33:23.100
There's any amount of stuff on what it looks like, you know, what the plant does.

33:23.100 --> 33:27.180
But what do the mitochondria do?

33:27.880 --> 33:32.480
What happens to the cytoplasm?

33:32.860 --> 33:41.060
What differences are there on the sub-molecular level when a plant goes dormant?

33:41.300 --> 33:42.480
And we can't find anything.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.080
There may be something.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.520
But I have not been able to find it.

33:46.520 --> 33:55.460
My friend at SFA library checked out a stack of books half as long as I am.

33:56.340 --> 33:57.920
And there was nothing in there.

33:58.340 --> 34:01.580
And then the lady down in Houston couldn't find anything there either.

34:01.720 --> 34:02.680
So very interesting.

34:03.180 --> 34:04.860
So you stumbled across things like that?

34:04.880 --> 34:05.240
Yeah.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.800
Yeah, a lot of things.

34:07.800 --> 34:15.720
Do you wish you started writing, let's say, writing towards being published at an earlier age?

34:17.380 --> 34:20.600
You know, I have given that a lot of thought.

34:20.940 --> 34:23.340
It's a very rough road, I hope.

34:24.540 --> 34:30.340
But I have come to the conclusion that people who have a great deal of success, very young,

34:31.060 --> 34:36.520
quite often don't keep pushing themselves to refine their technique,

34:36.540 --> 34:42.320
get better and better and better so that by golly you are so good they can't turn you down.

34:42.980 --> 34:47.920
You know, this is really a good head of steam to have behind you.

34:48.540 --> 34:50.860
Okay, I've been rejected for 20 years.

34:51.020 --> 34:51.860
I'm not going to quit.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.760
I'm going to get so good there's no way they can keep turning me down.

34:54.760 --> 35:05.040
And besides which, you know, when you've lived 40 years, you know, a lot of things you didn't know when you lived 25 years.

35:06.500 --> 35:17.300
You understand not only what people do, but how they feel under different circumstances when a husband comes home and has lost his job.

35:17.920 --> 35:21.820
You not only know how he acts, you know how he and his wife feel about it.

35:21.820 --> 35:30.580
And this is something that I think causes a great deal of modern non-genre fiction to be superficial.

35:31.360 --> 35:42.160
People are writing about it who have never stood in those shoes and who don't really understand what it does to your guts to have a child get deathly ill at two o'clock in the morning.

35:42.700 --> 35:50.380
You know, all this sort of thing to have a husband almost killed by a tractor, which I did 30 miles out in the country.

35:50.380 --> 35:55.860
With the wounds so close to the artery that you could see the artery pulsing.

35:56.320 --> 36:01.420
And you had to get him in the truck and get him to the hospital and not panic.

36:02.140 --> 36:10.700
Oh, and be so proud of my sons who were something like 15 and 17, I guess at the time.

36:11.340 --> 36:13.300
Never turn their steadiest rocks.

36:13.560 --> 36:17.400
Got the cot mattress in the van.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.180
Got their daddy in the van.

36:19.180 --> 36:27.180
While I was calling the hospital, got him in there and got him up there and nobody quivered.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.480
We waited through all the surgery and everything.

36:31.380 --> 36:37.120
Got home that night and you talk about three people sitting and shaking for about three hours.

36:37.940 --> 36:42.000
But while the chips were down, it was really a neat thing.

36:42.260 --> 36:46.740
But now this is something that you have lived through when you're 25 years old or even 30 some night.

36:47.720 --> 36:50.400
And the longer you live, the more you have to write about.

36:50.600 --> 36:51.760
You got to live it to write it.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.020
You got to live it to write it.

36:53.100 --> 36:53.720
It's your hand.

36:54.260 --> 36:54.660
Okay.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.220
Any other questions?

36:57.160 --> 36:58.980
You read all my questions out here.

36:59.640 --> 37:00.960
I didn't need to say a thing.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.380
We really appreciate it.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.560
I love enjoying it.

37:05.260 --> 37:07.640
As you can doubt, let's tell, I love to talk.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.380
We love to listen.

37:09.980 --> 37:11.780
Most of my ancestors are Irish.

37:11.780 --> 37:13.720
Don't do it yet, David.

37:14.060 --> 37:15.980
It's mayhem, right?

37:16.520 --> 37:17.040
Mayhem.

37:17.700 --> 37:18.800
Art of mayhem.

37:19.000 --> 37:19.480
Mayhem.

37:19.740 --> 37:20.000
Okay.

37:20.220 --> 37:23.620
I just want to tell myself that because I'll call it mayhem if I don't.
