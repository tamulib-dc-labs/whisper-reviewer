Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.880
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.480 --> 00:46.100
And here are your hosts. This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. How many science fiction works

00:46.100 --> 00:51.120
feature spacecraft capable of planet hopping, interstellar travel, or even galaxy galloping?

00:51.600 --> 00:55.520
Yet in our experience we know it takes several days travel to reach even the moon and years to

00:55.520 --> 01:00.280
reach the nearest planets. Travel to the stars is presently unthinkable. In space opera, the writer

01:00.280 --> 01:04.940
usually invokes some kind of faster than light drive which glosses over the basics of the special

01:04.940 --> 01:09.460
theory of relativity. We asked physicist and science fiction writer Robert Forward how it may be

01:09.460 --> 01:14.580
possible to travel faster than light. When you talk about going faster than light, really what you

01:14.580 --> 01:23.220
want to do is get from here to there without traveling all the steps in between. If you can do

01:23.220 --> 01:29.340
that, then you can go faster than light. There are two ways at least that I know to do that. One is to

01:29.340 --> 01:35.340
find a space warp. You jump into the space warp, you go into a hyperspace, and then you come out of

01:35.340 --> 01:42.180
another space warp somewhere else in our universe. And if you can do that in a time shorter than it

01:42.180 --> 01:49.240
takes you to travel over the top line, then you've done that. And the amazing thing about it is the

01:49.240 --> 01:54.640
Einstein General Theory of relativity has space warps in it. Going through a space warp is one way

01:54.640 --> 02:02.140
to get around the speed of light limit. And what's the second way? Then the other way to go faster

02:02.140 --> 02:09.740
and speed up light is to destroy the space between you and where you want to go. Now this space drive

02:09.740 --> 02:19.080
theory was invented by a student of Roger Penrose. He's a scientific expert and relativist that works

02:19.080 --> 02:27.720
with Hawking on gravitation. And he's working on a thing called twister theory. And in the twister

02:27.720 --> 02:37.060
theory, the real universe is not what we see. That's only a reduced image of it. The real universe is

02:37.060 --> 02:43.040
an eight-dimensional universe that's made up of twisters. The twisters not only make up all the

02:43.040 --> 02:50.800
particles in the space and time that we live in, it even makes up the space and the time. It takes a

02:50.800 --> 02:55.980
certain collection of twisters to make up a point in space. It takes another collection of

02:55.980 --> 03:04.460
twisters to make up a point in time. This collection of twisters is a fairly uniform thing, and that's

03:04.460 --> 03:09.560
why we see space as it is according to Penrose. Now we don't know whether the twister theory is

03:09.560 --> 03:18.180
correct, but Roger is hoping that it will turn out to be an accurate method, I mean accurate theory for the

03:18.180 --> 03:23.760
interest. So how does one build a faster than light drive based on the twister theory of Penrose and his

03:23.760 --> 03:33.720
students? If you want the twister space too much, give it a real strong warp, then it's no longer

03:33.720 --> 03:39.960
ordered well enough to make a piece of space or a piece of time. So if you take a piece of

03:39.960 --> 03:47.200
twister space and you warp it badly, the space and the time that it used to make now disappears. It's

03:47.200 --> 03:53.980
no longer there. So their version of a different kind of a faster than light drive is you take a

03:53.980 --> 03:59.860
spacecraft up, you get it out in the wave in the planets and so forth, then you turn on the

03:59.860 --> 04:09.900
twister warping machine in your spacecraft on the side parts Alpha Centauri and you just warp that

04:09.900 --> 04:17.920
space so much that you warp that twister space so much that the space time between here and Alpha

04:17.920 --> 04:24.080
Centauri disappears. And what you'll see if you're sitting in the spacecraft is that all of a sudden

04:24.080 --> 04:28.520
Alpha Centauri just come right towards you and then pretty soon you look out one window, you see the

04:28.520 --> 04:35.840
sun, you look out the other window, you'll see Alpha Centauri. Then the machine inside the spacecraft

04:36.420 --> 04:42.560
unwarps the space but on the other side of the spacecraft and all that space now reappears between

04:42.560 --> 04:46.580
the spacecraft and the sun, you watch the sun recede off another distance while you stay there

04:46.580 --> 04:51.200
with Alpha Centauri. So that's another way to get there. You just get rid of the space between here

04:51.200 --> 05:03.020
and there. This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science

05:03.020 --> 05:07.220
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:51.980 --> 05:56.140
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:11.720 --> 06:17.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.360
And here are your hosts.

06:25.420 --> 06:30.620
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. No other field has fans as distinctive and intense, some would

06:30.620 --> 06:34.300
even say as fanatical, Science Fiction does. Every year there are hundreds of conventions

06:34.300 --> 06:38.460
around the country, from small local affairs to the incredible world convention in which fans

06:38.460 --> 06:43.560
gather. They come for various reasons of course, to socialize with like-minded people, to meet

06:43.560 --> 06:47.820
science fiction and fantasy authors, to buy books at the dealer's tables. There's one particular

06:47.820 --> 06:52.820
type of fan with a special, consuming interest, costuming and masquerade. Most conventions

06:52.820 --> 06:57.400
therefore have a masquerade section, a contest for fans who have made and presented a costume

06:57.400 --> 07:01.340
from some science fiction or fantasy work. The Science Fiction Radio Show spoke with

07:01.340 --> 07:04.940
Teresa Patterson, a fan who has won numerous awards for her science fiction and fantasy

07:04.940 --> 07:09.620
costuming. She says a few years ago she was hooked on Star Trek but do nothing about fandom.

07:10.160 --> 07:15.480
But one day after Star Trek there was a big advertisement for a Star Trek convention in Dallas

07:16.080 --> 07:19.780
and it was going to have some of the stars there and everything and I'd never heard of such a thing.

07:20.220 --> 07:27.760
But it sounded like a lot of fun so we went down and then I ran into nearly 1500 to 2000 fans who

07:27.760 --> 07:34.140
also liked Star Trek, who also had a reason for coming to Science Fiction and Fantasy and had been

07:34.140 --> 07:39.720
touched by Star Trek because of this feeling they had and all of a sudden I had a family and a place

07:39.720 --> 07:45.420
to belong and I've been an avid fan ever since going to as many conventions as I could and one

07:45.420 --> 07:51.040
aspect of this convention was costuming and I'd always been sort of interested in theater and

07:51.040 --> 07:55.300
that sort of thing but never really involved. But here were all these people who weren't really in

07:55.300 --> 07:59.940
the theater and weren't performers but they had all these wonderful costumes and were going up and

07:59.940 --> 08:04.380
doing the masquerades. The next time they had a convention I was ready and I had my first costume

08:04.380 --> 08:09.880
it was a very poorly made mirror mirror costume from the Star Trek episode Mirror Mirror.

08:11.240 --> 08:16.360
But it was a beginning and it was something and all of a sudden I was involved and I had a part

08:16.360 --> 08:21.440
in a world where in my male life I didn't have much of anything that I really belonged to

08:22.240 --> 08:28.140
and through fandom and science fiction and belonging to that world I eventually learned how

08:28.600 --> 08:35.440
to belong in a normal world again and basically it changed my entire life. I actually even became

08:35.440 --> 08:39.780
popular in high school which at the time that I started in fandom I would have thought that

08:39.780 --> 08:45.660
popularity was something I would never see. So and then it grew from there I became a theater

08:45.660 --> 08:52.560
and drama major at UTA and I now work as a professional singer and performer and do a lot of

08:52.560 --> 08:58.680
costuming with that job and freelance costuming but my first love is still making characters come

08:58.680 --> 09:04.880
alive on the stage at science fiction and fantasy conventions because I think that what I was searching

09:04.880 --> 09:08.880
for at the time was a reality that I could fit into and I think that's what the other fans are

09:08.880 --> 09:13.800
searching for and the masquerade gives me a chance to make that dream become a reality.

09:24.460 --> 09:28.080
We asked her to give us an example of bringing a science fiction character to life through

09:28.080 --> 09:34.140
costuming. One of our most successful costume skits that we designed and I had some other people

09:34.140 --> 09:41.820
with me at the time we went to World Con in Boston and we had a young fellow who was a good friend

09:41.820 --> 09:47.320
of mine and my little sister did a Star Wars get together but what they did was the lights

09:47.320 --> 09:53.320
darkened and the Star Wars theme came up and all of a sudden Luke Skywalker came flying through the

09:53.320 --> 10:00.120
air doing somersaults onto the stage stopped and did a one-handed handstand very precariously

10:00.120 --> 10:07.560
balancing using the force to hold him up and then Yoda came slowly onto stage nodding wisely and

10:07.560 --> 10:11.640
instructing him on the use of the force he didn't get it right the first time then he tried again

10:11.640 --> 10:17.100
the second time and finally succeeded with a perfect one-handed handstand balancing with the

10:17.100 --> 10:21.940
use of the force and then left up did a couple more flying leaps and somersaults in the middle

10:21.940 --> 10:27.980
of the air across the stage and left standing ovation by 9000 screaming people who for them

10:27.980 --> 10:33.620
Star Wars was alive we'll talk with Theresa Patterson about fans and costuming next time

10:40.300 --> 10:45.000
this has been the science fiction radio show production of the permy and basin science fiction

10:45.000 --> 10:49.280
association produced in conjunction with odessa college in odessa texas

11:33.200 --> 11:37.280
coming up next is the science fiction radio show so stay with us

11:52.960 --> 11:58.220
this is the science fiction radio show a commentary on science fiction and fantasy

12:00.940 --> 12:02.580
and here are your hosts

12:06.560 --> 12:10.420
this is david karson and daryl lane we're talking with threesa paterson

12:11.000 --> 12:15.940
fan and award-winning costume designer Patterson believes that the best costumes are those that

12:15.940 --> 12:19.960
make the science fiction or fantasy character come to life for the viewers therefore in addition

12:19.960 --> 12:24.480
to constructing the costume itself she also creates a setting and sort of a brief script to

12:24.480 --> 12:29.820
put the character in she takes us through one of her creations now i also have another one that has

12:29.820 --> 12:36.620
been extremely successful it's called morgan lefay and the character basically i was sitting around

12:36.620 --> 12:42.300
trying to think of what is a really way out character that's not all that well known but that

12:42.300 --> 12:47.600
could command the stage and make that same kind of reality come about and it occurred to me that

12:47.600 --> 12:52.400
very little has been done with the saucer is morgan lefay who's from the arthurian legend and who

12:52.400 --> 12:57.940
was the one that eventually defeated merlin and i thought if i can make this character do a spell

12:57.940 --> 13:03.840
on stage so that the audience really believes it that that would be an excellent kind of costume to

13:04.540 --> 13:08.920
so i designed the costume and of course it's different than designing a costume for a

13:08.920 --> 13:13.400
for a movie character or a television character because it was completely up to my imagination

13:13.400 --> 13:20.960
what i wanted to do with it so i used a lot of reds and and blacks and lots of gold and to create

13:20.960 --> 13:28.680
a total effect of color but somber evil color and made a very large headdress with lots of

13:28.680 --> 13:35.360
sparkles on it to catch the light and designed it in such a way so that it would give the impression

13:35.880 --> 13:41.740
of an evil sauceress who had a lot of power and was a ruler in her own right and designed the

13:41.740 --> 13:46.720
cloak so that it would actually fold out into a half circle so that would look like bat wings on

13:46.720 --> 13:52.120
the back the costume was beautiful but that's not enough what paterson had to come up with was

13:52.120 --> 13:56.580
something for morgan lefay to do then she had to locate a soundtrack that would somehow convey the

13:56.580 --> 14:01.540
evil and menace of the sorceress paterson did both of these things then she added a little extra to

14:01.540 --> 14:06.900
the sound effects and then i added a soundtrack record which had thunder and lightning on it

14:06.900 --> 14:11.740
and went into my handy dandy little stereo set in the middle of the living room bought a bunch of

14:11.740 --> 14:16.580
patch cores from radio shacks so that the room looked like spaghetti's bill and patched it all

14:16.580 --> 14:22.340
together and using a normal hand mic and a reverb effect from the speakers being on at the same time

14:22.340 --> 14:28.300
as the recording managed to get an evil reverberating sound to the voice lightning and thunder in the

14:28.300 --> 14:34.260
background this awesome evil music building and and flowing and a high climax and then fading out in

14:34.260 --> 14:39.740
the distance so i had a wonderful soundtrack and if the mic failed i'd still be fine because i had it all on

14:39.740 --> 14:40.040
tape

14:48.260 --> 14:52.260
finally she describes the presentation of the character at a convention before a large audience

14:53.120 --> 14:58.140
and the way the actual skit came off was something like this the stage would darken

14:58.760 --> 15:04.620
and then you'd see a red glow moving up onto the stage and you'd see just the outline of this bizarre

15:04.620 --> 15:12.100
golden mask and headdress and a red garbed woman holding the red globe and the music starts and

15:12.100 --> 15:16.860
starts to build and all of a sudden the spell starts and then suddenly there's a burst of flame

15:16.860 --> 15:21.520
from the red globe and then there's a spill builds and she starts summoning the darkness the room

15:21.520 --> 15:25.940
gets darker for a moment and then there's another burst of flame and the room starts to lighten

15:25.940 --> 15:31.720
just a little bit and the spell builds and builds until finally she banishes the light from her and

15:31.720 --> 15:38.260
says darkness be gone and then blasts this huge shot of fire blue flame straight up into the sky

15:38.260 --> 15:43.940
and the darkness is gone and then she tells you that she is morgan lefay and then demonstrates the

15:43.940 --> 15:49.460
costume and shows the wide wings of the bat and slowly walks off as the thunder fades into the

15:49.460 --> 15:57.660
distance again i got a standing ovation the costume has never not won a prize it has always been

15:57.660 --> 16:04.300
first and second everywhere i've taken it and there are better costumes but it comes to life

16:04.300 --> 16:08.720
and that's what the people are looking for is a way to bring their fantasies and their dreams

16:08.720 --> 16:14.540
into reality so they can touch them so it's something they can really have a tangible experience from

16:15.180 --> 16:16.800
more with teresa paterson next time

16:23.180 --> 16:28.500
this has been the science fiction radio show production of the permean basin science fiction

16:28.500 --> 16:32.780
association produced in conjunction with odessa college in odessa texas

16:47.520 --> 16:57.840
um

17:05.960 --> 17:06.380
you

17:19.700 --> 17:23.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:39.320 --> 17:44.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.920
And here are your hosts.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.860
This is Darrel Lane and David Carson.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.840
Teresa Patterson is a science fiction fantasy fan who was turned on by the idea of making

17:58.840 --> 18:01.220
familiar characters from the field come to life for others.

18:01.860 --> 18:05.300
She goes to science fiction conventions with carefully constructed costumes and colorful

18:05.300 --> 18:05.760
skits.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.740
She enters the masquerade or some costuming competition with her creations and has won

18:09.740 --> 18:10.280
many awards.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.160
Costuming is a fascinating part of science fiction fandom.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.300
We observe that there must be some acting ability that goes along with it.

18:16.780 --> 18:23.580
Of course, but actually I think there's a bit of actress or actor in almost everyone

18:24.180 --> 18:27.900
who's into the fandom scene at all and even people who aren't.

18:28.380 --> 18:31.700
It's just a matter of whether we can actually do something with it or not.

18:31.940 --> 18:34.680
A lot of people just assume, well, that'll never happen.

18:34.740 --> 18:35.900
I'll never get to do anything with it.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.760
And they forget about that part of their personality.

18:38.260 --> 18:39.120
I'm a little more stubborn.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.840
I intend to do it professionally eventually.

18:40.840 --> 18:47.180
And to some extent, I'm doing that now with my performing as a singer and dancer with

18:47.180 --> 18:50.600
the singing telegram companies and as a model and so forth.

18:50.980 --> 18:56.000
And I've been in two science fiction movies as an extra, Logan's Run and Laid of Heaven,

18:56.280 --> 18:57.680
which both were a lot of fun.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.880
But it doesn't take an actor or an actress to do these kind of things.

19:01.880 --> 19:06.960
And I've seen a lot of really wonderful skits and costumes and performances pulled off by

19:06.960 --> 19:12.100
people who had never even considered the idea of being professional actors or actresses.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.480
They just want to make it real.

19:13.860 --> 19:18.700
And that's all acting ever was, was just trying to make something real and recreate something.

19:19.140 --> 19:22.360
It's just that what we do is a little different than your typical stage play.

19:23.420 --> 19:26.900
But it should be no less entertaining and we're trying to create it so that it's no

19:26.900 --> 19:27.600
less entertaining.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.880
Patterson usually works with a group of friends in performing her mass grade skits.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.940
Who wondered how newcomers took to costuming.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.860
Do they become converts fairly quickly?

19:35.860 --> 19:41.720
We don't have anyone who's ever met or joined our group that hasn't immediately ended up

19:41.720 --> 19:42.280
in a costume.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.280
Sometimes under protest the first time, but they always end up under a costume and then

19:48.280 --> 19:50.060
they always want more and more costumes.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.120
And the next thing you know, we've got a whole new set of costumers.

19:55.420 --> 20:00.140
When we went to Boston, we took five people in four different costume skits.

20:00.820 --> 20:04.640
These five people, I was the only one who'd ever been to a world com before.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.460
Most of them had never even been to a major convention before.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.120
All they knew was they wanted to do the masquerade.

20:10.440 --> 20:14.860
They loved science fiction and fantasy and fandom and they wanted to do the masquerade.

20:15.140 --> 20:18.800
And they had a lot of creativity and they were willing to listen to suggestions and we

20:18.800 --> 20:19.560
all worked together.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.300
And we came away with four awards.

20:23.540 --> 20:27.200
People who nobody had ever heard of before, we went up there to the world con and won

20:27.200 --> 20:28.300
four of the top awards.

20:28.780 --> 20:32.000
Best presentation overall, first runner up for best presentation.

20:32.820 --> 20:37.580
Star Wars special award prize and first runner up for best fantasy.

20:44.980 --> 20:49.180
We asked Patterson how she taught herself to do the elaborate costuming she's doing now.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.580
I still don't know what I'm doing now.

20:54.020 --> 20:59.840
It's, I've learned a lot from other people and from lots of trial and error, mostly trial and

20:59.840 --> 21:00.100
error.

21:00.740 --> 21:06.220
I discovered fabric glue when I was in desperation and it works wonderfully on all kinds of things.

21:06.940 --> 21:11.400
When I started costuming, I really didn't know anything about sewing at all.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.040
The idea of making clothes was the farthest thing from my mind.

21:16.700 --> 21:20.180
And it just happened that I needed a costume and I had to figure out how to create this

21:20.180 --> 21:23.020
thing that you couldn't possibly buy in a store by its very nature.

21:23.900 --> 21:27.040
And the first costumes were very much trial and error.

21:27.040 --> 21:31.320
But since then I've learned a lot of shortcuts, shortcuts that an average seamstress would

21:31.320 --> 21:34.320
probably never use because they learned all the rules and I didn't.

21:34.880 --> 21:40.000
And I try to pass on those shortcuts and a lot of the major conventions, they have workshops

21:40.560 --> 21:45.760
where they discuss costuming and shortcuts that other people have find and stage techniques.

21:46.180 --> 21:51.400
And there are books and magazines out that cover costuming and make up and easy ways to do all

21:51.400 --> 21:51.980
these things.

21:52.800 --> 21:56.600
Any fan who's seen some of Theresa Patterson's work can't help but be impressed.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.720
She's made many characters from fantasy and science fiction live.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.880
We'll talk about some other aspects of fandom on our next show.

22:09.940 --> 22:14.300
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

22:14.300 --> 22:18.500
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:04.460 --> 23:08.480
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:24.120 --> 23:29.420
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.740
And here are your hosts.

23:37.800 --> 23:42.100
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. This will be our final show with Theresa Patterson,

23:42.300 --> 23:46.340
Science Fiction Fan and Costume Designer. Patterson talks about the various types of

23:46.340 --> 23:50.040
science fiction fans. And our listeners should keep in mind that in fan terminology,

23:50.520 --> 23:56.440
fin is the plural of fan. There are actually several different level of fans. There are

23:56.440 --> 24:01.480
new fin which are people who just discovered that oh you mean there's somebody else that

24:01.480 --> 24:06.920
reads this stuff besides me. There are true fin who are the people who go to conventions

24:07.620 --> 24:14.640
on a live and die situation and fandom is a way of life and will sell whatever they can sell at

24:14.640 --> 24:18.520
the dealer's tables if they can make enough money to get back and forth between the conventions

24:19.160 --> 24:26.320
and who literally the convention society is their social life. Then there are a whole scope of people

24:26.320 --> 24:30.460
in between. There are what we call closet fans who are the people who read the books,

24:30.860 --> 24:35.520
who watch the shows, who go to the movies, but who have absolutely no idea that there's any

24:35.520 --> 24:42.140
kind of organization out there whatsoever. There are the slightly organized fans which are people

24:42.140 --> 24:47.460
who realize that there is organization who maybe go to a con every now and then, who every now and

24:47.460 --> 24:51.480
then get a chance to meet their favorite author, but who really aren't that much into the convention

24:51.480 --> 24:55.120
scene. It's just something that they like and every now and then they like to express the fact that

24:55.120 --> 25:00.420
they enjoy it. And then of course there are the professional fan which are people who through

25:00.420 --> 25:04.900
their professions one way or the other have somehow gotten tied up with the science fiction or fantasy

25:04.900 --> 25:11.260
genre and because they deal with it every day or part of every day and because they must like it

25:11.260 --> 25:13.540
or they wouldn't deal with it to some extent. They're fan too.

25:20.120 --> 25:24.020
Serious science fiction fans who attend conventions live in a weird sort of world with

25:24.020 --> 25:28.440
its own activities and even its own vocabulary. Both these aspects of fandom are illustrated in

25:28.440 --> 25:33.680
the word, folk singing. We asked Patterson to explain it to us. Well basically like any other,

25:33.880 --> 25:40.520
when you take fandom as a microcosm of people and that this is their social life when they're at a

25:40.520 --> 25:47.540
convention, you have to deal with the fact that social life includes entertainment. And if you're

25:47.540 --> 25:50.860
into science fiction and fantasy and you're doing something special like a convention,

25:51.620 --> 25:55.320
you don't want to go out and entertain yourself by going to the local bar or the local disco.

25:55.540 --> 26:01.320
That's boring. You want to do something that's uniquely fandom. And so something that was developed

26:01.320 --> 26:07.680
through fandom is a thing called folk singing. Folk singing is folk singing sort of. Basically,

26:07.860 --> 26:16.460
folk singing is a creation of songs that are performed by one person or many person on or off

26:17.560 --> 26:21.560
or on the same page. So in one song, it's a song that's written specifically for the audience of

26:21.560 --> 26:27.700
science fiction and fantasy listeners. Patterson says there can be different kinds of folk singing

26:27.700 --> 26:34.160
but that they all fulfill a need among science fiction fans. Now some of folk singing is very

26:34.160 --> 26:40.100
simple. It simply involves taking a tune from a normal song and changing the words around to have

26:40.100 --> 26:44.960
something to do with science fiction or fantasy. And usually those are funny and they're the kind

26:44.960 --> 26:47.280
that you can get a lot of giggles off and everyone joins in.

26:47.720 --> 26:54.580
But the more serious element is original songs that deal with very serious ideas like the

26:54.580 --> 26:59.780
fact that man's finally reaching for space and the Columbia's here or the fact that

27:00.340 --> 27:04.080
when are we really going to get to be dancing on the moon by the time it actually happens

27:04.080 --> 27:07.100
I'll be too old and things like that.

27:07.460 --> 27:12.500
And Filking is a whole type of folk singing strictly for fans.

27:13.540 --> 27:18.200
And some fans don't like it because they don't like the taking of other people's music

27:18.200 --> 27:20.060
and putting other lyrics to it.

27:20.240 --> 27:24.500
But for most fans it's a wonderful outlet for getting to know other people and just

27:24.500 --> 27:28.980
sit around at night when there's nothing else to do and sing songs and get a very close

27:28.980 --> 27:34.240
type of camaraderie that you only get in some other kind of very close knit group.

27:34.620 --> 27:39.600
Not all conventions have folk singing but the more intimate ones where it really is

27:39.600 --> 27:44.360
a social life type situation do because it's a very big part of the social life.

27:45.140 --> 27:49.160
Patterson's enthusiasm for science fiction and science fiction fandom is obvious and

27:49.160 --> 27:49.500
infectious.

27:56.780 --> 28:01.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

28:01.220 --> 28:05.420
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
