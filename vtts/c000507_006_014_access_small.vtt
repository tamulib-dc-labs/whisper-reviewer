00:11.200 --> 00:18.340
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.340 --> 00:20.580
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.880 --> 00:27.120
This is David Cruz and David Carson.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.880
Today we continue with part three of our interview with author Jack Williamson.

00:36.180 --> 00:43.100
Say in reference to cloning or genetic engineering, would you say that there is no area of science

00:43.100 --> 00:48.180
that man can monkey with anything he wants? Is there anything which we shouldn't touch,

00:48.180 --> 00:52.280
which would be wrong for science to meddle with or monkey with?

00:53.120 --> 01:01.380
Well, I suppose I'm a sort of a relative. Maybe I'm a Darwinian evolutionist.

01:01.660 --> 01:09.360
It's hard to find any absolute symbols or standards or whatever, what is wrong and right.

01:09.360 --> 01:18.700
If you look at the whole evolutionary picture, why some things, patterns of growth and ways

01:18.700 --> 01:24.080
of behavior and so forth lead to the survival of the individual and the species, and some don't.

01:24.220 --> 01:34.420
That's one available standard of behavior. If you look at that, why the technologies

01:34.420 --> 01:42.620
seem likely to survive and prevail unless they destroy themselves and whatever is going to destroy.

01:43.240 --> 01:52.480
The race is obviously bad in that way, and it seems to me whom we open the atom risk skating on thin ice,

01:52.880 --> 01:59.260
and there might be similar hazards in genetic engineering that is theoretically we could

01:59.260 --> 02:03.560
design a form of life that would wipe us out. Maybe we will.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.540
Maybe we need the humanoids to keep us from doing that.

02:07.020 --> 02:15.420
That's what they're for, but personally being sort of individualist, I hate to give up completely

02:15.420 --> 02:22.420
the humanoids. There is one more work I keep forgetting about this one, the CT work, CT ship,

02:22.980 --> 02:25.120
is that the way that's pronounced?

02:25.340 --> 02:34.080
CT, it was a kind of abbreviated contra-terrine with the letters C and T and I just spelled it out.

02:34.520 --> 02:43.140
That was a work I did for Kamal and enjoyed doing it. I went to him with the idea for a series of

02:43.140 --> 02:51.340
stories about the planetary engineers who would terraform new worlds, that is, would rebuild them,

02:52.080 --> 02:57.980
take away the atmosphere, the chemistry, maybe the gravitation, whatever, to make them suitable

02:57.980 --> 03:04.820
for human settlement. Kamal suggested that some of these new worlds might be CT, that is,

03:04.860 --> 03:12.860
antimatter, which was pretty new to science fiction then. I was fascinated and I did a series of stories

03:12.860 --> 03:15.660
and then a serial that eventually became two novels.

03:17.260 --> 03:20.800
Where did you come up with the concept terraformed? Did you coin that word?

03:21.220 --> 03:29.060
As far as I know, I invented the word. There are a few such terms that I think I can claim credit for,

03:29.180 --> 03:37.420
such as terraforming and psionics and the android is distinct from the Robert and so forth.

03:39.060 --> 03:45.660
Didn't the CT novel and the short stories lead into a syndicated strip in the newspapers?

03:46.020 --> 03:53.900
Yeah, that was one of my exciting adventures. I was sitting at the desk one day when the phone rang

03:53.900 --> 03:58.400
and the editor of the New York Sunday News was on the line and wanted to know if I would come to

03:58.400 --> 04:06.440
New York and write a comic strip and I caught my breath and said I would and they had read one of

04:06.440 --> 04:13.980
the CT novels, reviewed in the New York Times by a rather superior reviewer who said that the plot

04:13.980 --> 04:21.160
was pretty interesting but the way of writing made it look like a science fiction comic strip

04:21.820 --> 04:27.940
and this was in the early days of commercial TV when people were turning on the tube on Sunday

04:27.940 --> 04:34.040
morning instead of buying the Sunday news and somebody thought that if they had exclusive

04:34.040 --> 04:40.000
strips instead of syndicated strips that everybody else had it might give them a competitive edge.

04:40.500 --> 04:46.860
There isn't a planned four new comics including a Western and a Mystery and Adventure I think,

04:46.980 --> 04:52.560
but the science fiction one was the only one they did. It ran for three years but eventually

04:52.560 --> 04:58.340
didn't turn out to be the answer to TV. But the artist was Leah Lias who used to work with

04:58.340 --> 05:06.240
Milk and Ifom Terry and the Pirates and has a nice clean cut style and was good with new and

05:06.240 --> 05:13.460
strange characters and good with machines and the thing was fun to do. My heart was broken when

05:13.950 --> 05:23.480
it ended because I'd come to enjoy getting a regular check and it was at that time that I

05:23.480 --> 05:31.080
went back part-time into the academic world because I'd started taking college courses

05:31.080 --> 05:35.060
while the strip was running because it didn't take all my time to write it and

05:36.380 --> 05:43.580
asked for a graduate assistantship and math and they didn't have one but I was stared to

05:43.580 --> 05:52.760
run in English which turned out to be a unfortunate choice and the academic world did mesh very well

05:52.760 --> 05:59.420
with writing. It's wonderful to be paid to read good literature and talk about it with a

05:59.740 --> 06:06.780
congenial group of students and I enjoyed teaching and found that I was able to continue writing

06:06.780 --> 06:12.460
during holidays and vacations and maybe I learned a little bit more about

06:13.320 --> 06:19.280
literature and about people and so forth. I think it was a very happy experience.

06:20.160 --> 06:24.660
Didn't you also put together one of the first courses on science fiction?

06:25.120 --> 06:32.380
I think so. Mark Heligus at Colgate University wrote the first one that I knew about that was

06:32.380 --> 06:41.180
written up in the National Cervoir and I took the article out and showed it to the curriculum

06:41.180 --> 06:47.300
committee and chairman at Eastern and got approval for a course.

06:47.990 --> 06:54.640
What time was that? That was in, let's see Heligus started his course in 62 and I started

06:54.640 --> 07:04.440
1964 and taught it for a dozen years and spent part of those years doing all I could to promote

07:04.440 --> 07:11.160
academic science fiction elsewhere. I accumulated descriptions of other courses and lectured and

07:11.160 --> 07:18.480
published articles and finally put together a textbook for science fiction teachers and anthology

07:18.480 --> 07:25.620
of articles by likes of Asimov and Gwynne and Garn and others that has finally been published.

07:26.900 --> 07:33.100
How do you keep up with science? You must have a fairly extensive scientific background or any

07:33.100 --> 07:38.560
you know good science fiction writer must you? Well I've always been as I said fascinated with

07:38.560 --> 07:45.000
science as a sort of unfolding mystery that is I want to know as much as I can about

07:45.660 --> 07:51.480
the nature of the origins of the universe and I subscribe to a whole group of magazines,

07:52.220 --> 07:58.260
Science News, the Scientific American Science which is the publication of the American Association

07:58.260 --> 08:03.940
for the Advancement of Science which is much of it pretty technical but some things in it I can

08:03.940 --> 08:10.700
understand. I subscribe to a couple of astronomy magazines, I've subscribed to a couple of computer

08:10.700 --> 08:19.120
magazines since I bought the word processor and occasionally I get off to other events. My wife

08:19.120 --> 08:27.660
and I attended the Jupiter flyby at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory March a year ago and got a

08:27.660 --> 08:32.540
short story out of that that I called it they sent into the great red spot though I think

08:33.200 --> 08:40.040
and editors changing the name of it and we've been invited back to the southern flyby

08:40.700 --> 08:48.260
come November and something like that which gives you an opportunity to see actual science at work

08:48.260 --> 08:56.440
and science unfolding is it's about as exciting as anything could be. The Jupiter flyby where the

08:56.440 --> 09:03.140
the pictures of Jupiter and its satellites were coming in on the monitors one every 48 seconds

09:03.140 --> 09:10.500
most of them you knew would never be seen again it would select some to form more study but most

09:10.500 --> 09:20.520
of them were disappeared and it was just exciting these it was like exploring a new solar system

09:20.520 --> 09:25.220
these satellites up to that time it just been spots a light in the telescope and

09:25.860 --> 09:33.740
at the nearest best approaches where you can see details just a few kilometers across and each

09:33.740 --> 09:41.500
satellite was different with a different history with different clues about the origins of itself

09:41.500 --> 09:49.220
and the whole solar system and maybe the universe so things like that might make science as interesting

09:49.220 --> 09:57.940
as anything I know. To change the subject again, let's see if I remember now you have been president

09:57.940 --> 10:04.820
of the science fiction writers association are you still are? I finished my second term

10:05.360 --> 10:11.220
less than a month ago and I hope now to get back to to more science fiction. The term is for how

10:11.220 --> 10:18.580
long? It's term is only for one year and it was a very rewarding experience as I guess I've said

10:18.580 --> 10:26.140
before science fiction is a pretty small friendly close community and a lot of people in it have

10:26.140 --> 10:32.200
been good friends over the years and it was an opportunity to try to do something for science

10:32.200 --> 10:38.540
fiction but it took a good deal of time. What were your duties if you don't mind? Well

10:40.960 --> 10:48.380
there we have about 500 members we have all sorts of activities one of the most important

10:48.380 --> 10:56.780
is a grievance committee that tries to let's say avoid difficulties with editors and publishers

10:56.780 --> 11:03.060
and so forth to make sure that they treat us right. We have the Nubular Awards that are given each year

11:03.060 --> 11:12.840
to recognize work in the field we attempt to also publicize and propagandize science fiction

11:13.440 --> 11:20.700
and there are many many people in the organization who devote a lot of priceless time and energy to

11:20.700 --> 11:28.020
this but the whole thing has to be coordinated and people drop out and have to be replaced

11:28.680 --> 11:36.240
and misunderstandings develop that have to be somehow explained and new projects come along that

11:36.240 --> 11:44.500
need to be supported and there wasn't any one thing that that took a great deal of time but there

11:44.500 --> 11:57.840
was a continual flow of problems and minor decisions and so forth so that every week I'd have to spend

11:58.520 --> 12:03.820
maybe a couple of days catching up on the the mail and phone calls and whatever.

12:04.300 --> 12:09.180
What are the criteria for membership? Is everybody who is everybody automatically a member who

12:09.180 --> 12:13.120
publishes a story or does it have to take application? You have to make application and

12:13.120 --> 12:20.400
an affiliate member has to have at least one story professionally published in it

12:20.400 --> 12:28.840
an active member the requirement for that is three stories short stories or short works that

12:28.840 --> 12:33.760
doesn't have to be fiction stories or a longer work such as a novel or whatever

12:34.610 --> 12:41.960
and the deal is now of forty dollars a year and that we have two publications and monthly

12:43.400 --> 12:49.040
well between them they're monthly a forum that is essentially for the members with

12:49.560 --> 12:55.920
with official business and market reports and whatever and a bulletin that comes out

12:56.780 --> 13:03.240
four times a year that is devoted to more general articles background material on science and

13:03.240 --> 13:12.200
science fiction and the members are usually privileged to attend the self-wised read at the

13:12.200 --> 13:21.420
convention and I'd say membership is a sort of ticket to a club that I regard as exciting to

13:21.420 --> 13:28.720
you said there are some 500 members yes that must be the largest obviously the largest it's ever

13:28.720 --> 13:37.520
been oh yes it has grown still growing steadily the science fiction market as well until the last

13:37.520 --> 13:47.340
year or so was was booming various publishers paperback publishers had regular plans to publish

13:48.300 --> 13:55.420
four six sometimes eight titles a month and so that where Charlie Brown of Locust was keeping

13:55.420 --> 14:02.680
a record of the books published and that kept growing until the total past a thousand a year

14:02.680 --> 14:09.980
about half reprint and half new including fantasy as well as science fiction and I think that

14:10.500 --> 14:16.320
well since the depression and whatever it was where many publishers have cut back their schedules

14:16.320 --> 14:20.820
and it's a little harder for a new writer to break in wise but

14:22.560 --> 14:30.480
it's still very profitable and exciting field compared to what it was when there was one magazine

14:30.480 --> 14:41.780
I got 25 bucks for my first story and of course the big money is from films and tv and such things

14:42.520 --> 14:46.260
I know you said that it's hard for you to keep up with everything that's being published today but

14:46.260 --> 14:51.460
do you have any particularly favorite authors the younger ones say starting the last 10 years

14:51.460 --> 14:59.800
or so that you think you're going to be able well I don't follow well enough to say anything very

14:59.800 --> 15:07.100
intelligent when I was teaching I regarded Ursula Le Guin's left hand of darkness as a

15:08.060 --> 15:19.700
probably the best reason novel and I'm a great admirer of Heinlein especially the early Heinlein

15:19.700 --> 15:31.140
Arthur Clark and but I don't don't really keep up I just read or reread some of Gordon Dixon's

15:31.140 --> 15:40.640
child cycle and impressed with a broad optimistic view of human change and evolution that he's

15:40.640 --> 15:46.320
presenting what about new wave authors I guess a new wave technically is passed I think so

15:46.320 --> 15:54.100
what's your response to that I felt that the new wave was well I was sort of adding new wave

15:54.100 --> 16:01.380
because I felt the new wave people were first of all they were intensely pessimistic about

16:02.100 --> 16:11.460
science and they were trying to throw out the the traditional accepted literary patterns that

16:11.460 --> 16:19.480
at least were accepted by me and and used in the field and turning back to to literary experiments

16:19.480 --> 16:25.520
by people like Doris Pysos and James Joyce they had been tried a generation ago and they were

16:25.520 --> 16:31.960
brought on as they were something new again but I think by and large well let's say some of the

16:31.960 --> 16:40.140
new wave writers were very able and the the impact of the new world has been a new wave has been to

16:40.900 --> 16:48.420
improve the well the awareness of literary values of style and so forth so by and large it's been a

16:48.420 --> 16:53.980
good thing is it possible to blend the say the mainstream or the new wave attempt with with

16:53.980 --> 16:58.680
good science fiction are they are they mutually exclusive or is it possible to have the mainstream

16:58.680 --> 17:06.500
material at science fiction well I'm not enthusiastic about consolidating mainstream

17:06.500 --> 17:15.280
literature and science fiction but I also remember that there was a time when science fiction wasn't

17:15.280 --> 17:20.440
walled off in a category by itself and I don't think there's any reason it should be when Welles

17:20.440 --> 17:29.320
was publishing his stories they were just novels or romances or whatever and the science fiction was

17:29.320 --> 17:38.140
in a sort of ghetto quote ghetto for a generation I think this was partly due to the fact that he's

17:38.140 --> 17:44.660
published in pop magazines and people look down on the popes I think we're sort of getting over that

17:45.280 --> 17:54.040
but it's still a category a publisher's category like westerns or gothics or low romances or whatever

17:54.480 --> 18:02.860
and that means that if Don Wilhelm or Judy Lynn Del Ray or someone else packages a book in a

18:02.860 --> 18:14.700
recognizable science fiction package it'll sell enough copies to make a profit but it's a

18:14.700 --> 18:20.920
science fiction rax and the stands and the general public doesn't see it so people who get to be

18:21.680 --> 18:32.660
best sellers successful people like gone in vinyl gut and so forth tend to want to get the

18:32.660 --> 18:38.620
science fiction label off their stories when they begin to sell enough copies but I've never reached

18:38.620 --> 18:44.420
that stage myself I'm proud to have my own call science fiction you don't see a mora saying

18:44.700 --> 18:48.940
comparing it you're uniquely qualified to do this they're comparing the readership of science fiction

18:48.940 --> 18:54.900
today with say back in the 30s or early 40s wouldn't you see a greater proportion of the population

18:55.620 --> 19:02.260
reads and and appreciate science fiction I think so when I started what nobody knew what it was

19:02.260 --> 19:08.300
you had to explain it there was one science fiction magazine though some science fiction

19:08.300 --> 19:14.280
stories were running in magazines like galaxy and people like wells and conan dollout had been

19:14.280 --> 19:23.500
publishing occasional science fiction for not for a specialized audience all along but certainly

19:23.500 --> 19:29.880
certainly there are more people reading now than they ever were before but there are a lot more

19:29.880 --> 19:38.500
people who see it on tv or see science fiction movies they'll never read any of it when you go

19:38.500 --> 19:45.980
to a convention these days where the star trek fans and the comic book fans and the star wars

19:45.980 --> 19:53.180
fans and so forth sort of outnumber the science fiction fans a couple weeks ago I was at a convention

19:53.180 --> 20:01.180
in phoenix that was attended by I think about 800 people and I was really the only

20:02.760 --> 20:10.360
identifiable hard science fiction writer there they were they were there were star wars characters and

20:10.720 --> 20:19.500
there were comic books authors and so forth who had the big public and that's I'm no complaint

20:19.500 --> 20:23.860
about that you don't think that hurts the kind of science fiction that you value more say the movies

20:23.860 --> 20:30.200
the television that kind of material well movies have very seldom been good science fiction

20:32.580 --> 20:39.900
there've been a few good science fiction films but the science fiction or the sort I like is

20:39.900 --> 20:47.480
has been called a literature of ideas and to some extent it is and and the films I think

20:47.480 --> 20:55.080
necessarily deal not in ideas but in with emotions with sensation I just saw the shining

20:55.760 --> 21:04.200
and and I liked it as a superb piece of filmic craftsmanship. Tuberick wanted to

21:04.760 --> 21:09.780
scare the socks off the audience and by and large he did about as well as anybody ever will

21:09.780 --> 21:16.060
there are people who feel the neglected characterization and feel that the explanation of

21:16.060 --> 21:23.320
supernatural is not consistent but I feel that Tuberick knew what he was doing and he did it

21:23.320 --> 21:30.480
considering consistency where it seems to me that he was making a deliberate appeal to the irrational

21:30.480 --> 21:39.080
to the inexplicable to the totally mysterious and if he tried to explain all the the ghosts in the

21:39.740 --> 21:45.500
old hotel where he would have been letting down the suspense at the same time so I love it

21:46.060 --> 21:49.740
but do you think there have been any successful science fiction movies and well

21:50.860 --> 21:58.580
2001 I think was was tremendous and there are a number of others that are

21:59.580 --> 22:09.960
regardless classics but typically the movies and tv haven't done what might have been done

22:09.960 --> 22:17.660
in the first year or two of Star Trek they were buying professionally published science fiction

22:17.660 --> 22:23.940
stories or stories written by professional writers and I thought many of them were pretty good

22:23.940 --> 22:31.660
and gradually as time went on while they went more and more into the most standard Hollywood

22:32.540 --> 22:44.920
format and had less and less originality creativity and so forth and well space 1999 and

22:44.920 --> 22:55.840
battle star galactica are worse that is they have plenty of money for all sorts of expensive

22:55.840 --> 23:03.260
special effects but they are contempt for the intelligence the audience that is they don't

23:03.860 --> 23:08.460
they don't care about ideas about consistency or whatever all they're trying to do is

23:08.460 --> 23:15.260
create an emotional effect that if you know too much science or care too much about believability

23:15.260 --> 23:20.740
while the emotional effect doesn't work what do you think goes into making a good science fiction

23:20.740 --> 23:30.740
story well of course I'm something I'll believe in myself in emotional fakes that is you need a

23:30.740 --> 23:36.680
strong conflict and you need something that will evolve the involve the reader emotionally

23:36.680 --> 23:47.040
so that you need characters that he can either hate or identify with and you need some sense of

23:47.040 --> 23:57.220
originality you need if you've got it something new though that is not always possible and I

23:57.220 --> 24:07.990
tend myself to well to look for a theme for some sort of significant statement about science or the

24:07.990 --> 24:19.590
literature or the the impact of science and technology on individual human beings on human

24:19.590 --> 24:28.990
life on society on what the world might be but I think all of it is important as for the

24:28.990 --> 24:37.530
writer to be generally genuinely interested in what he's saying about something relevant to

24:38.040 --> 24:43.210
science and technology and change seems to me the essential thing is probably that

24:43.680 --> 24:50.190
science fiction recognizes that the world is changing under the impact of technology the

24:50.190 --> 24:58.310
future is going to be different and the mainstream quote audience either doesn't know this or

24:59.110 --> 25:04.950
prefers to forget it or whatever that's a good distinction to make I was going to ask you is

25:04.950 --> 25:08.910
that something you present in your you're presented in your classes when you taught science fiction

25:08.910 --> 25:15.890
that it it's concerned with change I think so distinction of mainstream material speaking of

25:15.890 --> 25:22.990
teaching why do you think science fiction say should be taught say say as far down as junior

25:22.990 --> 25:29.590
high junior high high school college is there any particular value it can offer students well I

25:29.590 --> 25:35.910
think that assuming that science fiction does deal with change the world is really changing so the

25:35.910 --> 25:43.690
recognition of this is an element of reality or realism that you don't have in a lot of classic

25:43.690 --> 25:49.330
literature and kids growing up are going to be living in a world that's different from the world

25:49.330 --> 25:56.770
around them now it seems to me they have a legitimate interest in what the future is going to be and in

25:56.770 --> 26:04.450
a practical teaching situation you're trying to pull kids off the playground out of in front of

26:04.450 --> 26:15.050
TV and teach them to read and to understand and to think and sometimes this is is pretty difficult

26:16.290 --> 26:25.950
I've tried various approaches to various literary figures and periods and some of them work very

26:25.950 --> 26:35.550
well and some of them don't and it seems to me that science fiction offers a sort of bridge or

26:35.550 --> 26:44.750
door or whatever to the interest of a lot of students that you don't have if you try to

26:45.250 --> 26:54.510
well go back to Shakespeare let's say yeah I think one thing science fiction forces a person

26:54.510 --> 26:59.650
who's reading it to do is to think about the future and to think about the world he's living in

26:59.650 --> 27:04.910
is related to the future I think that's basically what it's about really as much as you can say

27:04.910 --> 27:15.250
it's about anything and it seems to me that that generally you can classify it more or less as

27:15.250 --> 27:23.830
utopian or dystopian that is that you can look for some assumption that the technology is good

27:23.830 --> 27:29.750
or that technology is bad that the future is going to be better or the future is going to be worse

27:30.110 --> 27:38.970
or that the human being is a helpless victim of his environment and his own nature or that he can

27:39.810 --> 27:49.810
make significant decisions and and change his environment and and make things better than there

27:49.810 --> 27:58.850
were so that's that was basically the the approach I took in my classes beginning I like to begin

27:58.850 --> 28:03.910
with the second two books of God's progress which is written as deliberate criticism of

28:04.410 --> 28:11.770
the early scientists of the royal society and so forth and to present as far as I could selected

28:12.730 --> 28:20.530
stories that would be briefs on both sides dystopias and utopias optimism and pessimism

28:21.400 --> 28:30.790
selection from such people as well Clark and Heinlein and so forth on one side and

28:30.790 --> 28:40.430
they've my own human eyes so there's plenty of dystopian fiction usually better written and

28:40.890 --> 28:46.310
more engaging than the optimistic science fiction well though if you're going to categorize like

28:46.310 --> 28:53.950
that so you put wells and huxley and swift maybe ellison on the one hand maybe Heinlein as them

28:53.950 --> 28:58.750
off people like that on the other I would put you on that side the second side was the optimists

28:59.470 --> 29:04.570
ultimately even though you did write the human eyes well that's where I like to be okay that's fair

29:05.470 --> 29:09.610
this concludes our three-part interview with science fiction author jack Williamson

29:16.910 --> 29:24.430
this is david cruise daryl laine and david carcen this has been the science fiction radio show a

29:24.430 --> 29:31.190
presentation of the permean basin science fiction association in conjunction with kocv fm and odessa

29:31.190 --> 29:33.010
