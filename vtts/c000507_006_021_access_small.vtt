Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.780
And here are your hosts.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.600
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.920
George Zabrowski is a young science fiction writer and editor with four novels, a short

00:48.920 --> 00:51.280
story collection and two anthologies to his credit.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.780
His work is characterized by its serious, thoughtful approach to writing and a novel

00:55.780 --> 00:57.000
execution of ideas.

00:57.580 --> 00:59.920
Zabrowski's formal academic training is in philosophy.

01:00.260 --> 01:03.420
We asked him why with this background he chose to write science fiction.

01:04.360 --> 01:11.140
It seemed to me that science fiction always seemed the natural kind of writing.

01:12.560 --> 01:19.060
I grew up reading science fiction and its materials and the kinds of possibilities that

01:19.060 --> 01:28.120
it opened up to myself as a reader seemed to belong peculiarly to this time as opposed

01:28.120 --> 01:35.600
to the feeling I got when I read Charles Dickens or the 19th century writers, aside from Wells,

01:35.820 --> 01:38.960
of course, who straddled both centuries.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.260
It seemed to belong uniquely to the 20th century.

01:42.780 --> 01:44.440
Of course, I didn't think about it that way.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.100
That came much later.

01:46.360 --> 01:52.400
But I think the instinctive reaction was that it was something that was for me and that

01:52.400 --> 01:54.720
it belonged to my time.

01:56.420 --> 02:00.680
One of the elements that usually typifies definitions of science fiction is that it

02:00.680 --> 02:02.100
is a literature of ideas.

02:02.700 --> 02:06.420
When we asked Zabrowski how philosophical ideas have been handled in science fiction,

02:06.680 --> 02:09.540
he indicated that the approach has generally been superficial.

02:10.420 --> 02:11.940
Well, it's skin deep.

02:12.940 --> 02:19.700
This is surprising, possibly, to a literature that professes to be a literature of ideas.

02:20.080 --> 02:26.600
Yet, two areas, philosophy and cosmology, seemed to be very poorly represented, even

02:26.600 --> 02:33.400
though you would think that science fiction would cover these fields in a very deep fashion.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.240
But this is not really surprising.

02:35.240 --> 02:41.600
The most fiction, most literature, does not use philosophy in any original sense.

02:42.420 --> 02:47.800
What I mean is that philosophy is usually derived from somewhere else, from some thinker,

02:48.140 --> 02:55.160
and then is simply put to some use as background in a science fiction story or even in a contemporary novel.

02:57.860 --> 03:03.660
Most writers are not original thinkers in this regard, even Stapledon,

03:03.660 --> 03:09.960
who is the most overtly philosophical of science fiction writers, is clearly a spinosaist

03:09.960 --> 03:13.980
following the philosophy of spinosa kind of pantheism.

03:14.600 --> 03:19.200
There is not any original philosophizing going on.

03:20.480 --> 03:26.660
Of course, it would be ideal if you could have a science fiction writer who would be an original thinker

03:26.660 --> 03:32.540
and would present original thinking of a philosophical kind in his science fiction.

03:34.540 --> 03:44.420
But then you might say, why don't you just write a book of philosophy and then perhaps use the original philosophical material

03:44.420 --> 03:48.700
that he himself puts forward in his fiction.

03:49.380 --> 03:53.060
We asked Zabrowski if any present-day science fiction writers use this approach.

03:53.920 --> 03:59.220
Bremen does this to some degree. He's written philosophical works of enormous size

03:59.220 --> 04:04.460
and then used the ideas developed there for his science fiction.

04:05.280 --> 04:13.320
That's very, very rare. The kind of marketplace that science fiction has just doesn't demand

04:13.320 --> 04:20.020
that you become a philosopher or a scientist of any original stature to write science fiction.

04:20.020 --> 04:26.860
Do writers aim for particular audiences or niches in science fiction? Zabrowski indicated he does not.

04:27.780 --> 04:36.640
Well, I don't particularly aim for any audience. I simply aim to be clear and to communicate to any reader who can read fiction.

04:38.080 --> 04:43.040
The idea being that such a reader will understand what you have to say.

04:43.040 --> 04:51.140
I simply follow the idea of most writers that you have to communicate.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.040
More on George Zabrowski on our next show.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.800
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:04.120 --> 05:06.680
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

05:06.680 --> 05:09.860
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.940
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:09.580 --> 06:14.840
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:14.840 --> 06:19.140
And here are your hosts.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.460
This is David Cruz and Bill Vernon.

06:26.020 --> 06:29.460
Today's show continues the discussion with Science Fiction author George Zabrowski.

06:30.080 --> 06:35.360
Zabrowski's novels include The Omega Point and its prequel Ashes and Stars, The Star Web,

06:35.760 --> 06:39.300
and the recently published Macro Life, which we will discuss in detail later.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.600
His editing credits include the anthology Faster Than Light.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.480
Zabrowski provided us with many provocative ideas about the current state of science fiction.

06:47.980 --> 06:51.400
For instance, he considers much of what's published in science fiction unoriginal.

06:52.700 --> 06:59.060
Well, if you consider that science fiction has been anywhere between 10 and 15% of all fiction published,

07:00.140 --> 07:10.340
a great number of it is a derivative built on predigested ideas and predigested plots

07:10.340 --> 07:18.600
and a good example takes as a concept of space colonies or the L5, the society type of thing.

07:20.920 --> 07:25.720
It's very often simply been used as just another place to have an adventure of some kind,

07:25.900 --> 07:32.460
or a place to set a murder mystery or a suspense story of some kind or another.

07:32.460 --> 07:40.280
Predigestion seems to be the operative method of the copiers.

07:40.600 --> 07:45.220
Something comes in and it's slightly new and it's not used for itself.

07:45.220 --> 07:51.760
It's used as just another place to have another barbaric adventure or whatever.

07:52.660 --> 07:56.920
It's easier to do this than to be original in each and every case.

07:56.920 --> 08:03.240
I'm afraid that like many other writers, I wrote what I was most influenced by.

08:04.040 --> 08:11.980
But as you go on, you realize that quite possibly there is a way of doing things that is a little more original than that.

08:17.280 --> 08:23.700
According to Zabrowski, it may be the marketplace that influences writers to produce sure-selling, formula-written pieces.

08:23.700 --> 08:30.000
Well, the fact is that most science fiction has built in sales potential.

08:30.700 --> 08:36.160
A science fiction book will sell between 30 or 50 thousand copies no matter who wrote it.

08:37.240 --> 08:44.000
This is unfortunate. Most of the best writers of science fiction however become their own genres.

08:44.400 --> 08:49.340
Clarke, Gazzam, Alpine, Lyon are genres unto themselves within the genre.

08:49.340 --> 08:51.800
People will buy the name no matter what they write.

08:53.460 --> 08:59.920
This is also unfortunate but it is a sign of some progress on the part of the writer.

09:01.020 --> 09:05.580
I think even if you write a fairly experimental kind of book like Macro,

09:05.740 --> 09:10.340
because of the built-in potential there will be a certain number of readers who will buy it.

09:10.780 --> 09:16.260
There will be a smaller number of people who actually buy it because they're interested in that kind of thing.

09:16.260 --> 09:19.440
Maybe their tastes will be widened by it.

09:21.360 --> 09:25.380
You really can't tell. You just have to do what you really want to do.

09:25.460 --> 09:30.980
You can't simply write to fill a niche in the market.

09:32.300 --> 09:36.580
That's what strikes me as being very cynical by many writers.

09:37.180 --> 09:42.920
They do aim for a particular audience and they aim to deliver a certain product and they don't seem to have any other ambitions.

09:42.920 --> 09:51.560
This would be fine if some of these writers were not capable of more, in which case they're betraying their own abilities.

09:52.760 --> 10:00.320
This kind of comment on my part sounds perhaps very noble to many other writers.

10:00.780 --> 10:07.980
Very idealistic and they sort of shake their heads in the way that Clarke shook his head at Billy Budd's innocence.

10:07.980 --> 10:14.740
But that kind of attitude comes out of the environment in which they move.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.880
And I think you can create for yourself an ambitious environment in which you will produce,

10:21.320 --> 10:26.300
or at least have a shot at producing something that will be closer to what you're capable of doing.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.780
On our next show we will discuss Zabrowski's ambitious novel, Macro Life.

10:37.980 --> 10:43.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:43.160 --> 10:46.300
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.860
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:48.580 --> 11:53.840
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.140
And here are your hosts.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.900
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

12:04.900 --> 12:10.840
Science Fiction author George Zabrowski's first three novels, The Omega Point, Ashes and Stars, and Star Web,

12:11.220 --> 12:15.820
are well-written space operas with overtones of metaphysics, cosmology, and eschatology.

12:16.260 --> 12:20.300
When Zabrowski's fourth novel, Macro Life, was published in hardcover in 1979,

12:20.860 --> 12:26.000
it received rave reviews from such notables as Arthur C. Clarke, Gregory Benford, and Gerard K. O'Neill.

12:26.580 --> 12:33.400
The basic premise of Macro Life is that a culture cannot reach its full potential unless it leaves the planet on which it originated or inhabits.

12:33.400 --> 12:38.940
Right, only in self-contained worlds traveling in interstellar space, or at least in orbit around a planet,

12:39.300 --> 12:42.360
can a culture develop the social systems required for it to flourish.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.700
We asked Zabrowski how he conceived the idea of Macro Life.

12:46.320 --> 12:51.180
And I think I read an article by G. Harry Stein, who was a real hard science kind of buffed,

12:51.640 --> 12:56.360
and he complained that all the really new ideas, just around 1961 I think,

12:56.360 --> 13:01.880
he complained that all the new ideas were being ignored by science fiction,

13:02.020 --> 13:08.340
and that the best speculations were going on, places like General Electric, and think tanks,

13:08.600 --> 13:12.580
and whatever, and the science fiction writers were 25 years behind the times.

13:13.460 --> 13:19.760
So I looked at one of the ideas he mentioned, which was a concept called Macro Life,

13:19.760 --> 13:26.920
and it was written in two words by Dandridge Cole, and this was for something called the Ultimate Human Society.

13:28.020 --> 13:34.960
And Cole made a lot of sense to me, and so I decided then that I was going to write a novel to be called Macro Life.

13:35.520 --> 13:41.120
So Zabrowski took the central premise of Dandridge Cole's idea in 1961 and shaped it into a vision.

13:41.620 --> 13:46.460
Over the years I developed the idea much further than he had taken it.

13:46.460 --> 13:55.740
His macro worlds were on the order of the Queen Mary, 10,000 tons, 10,000 ton world,

13:55.880 --> 14:03.340
but very small, probably closer to O'Neill's concept of space colonies.

14:04.480 --> 14:12.620
My 600 kilometer egg shapes with dozens of levels and asteroid cores at the center

14:12.620 --> 14:16.560
are much more ambitious than anything Cole came up with.

14:16.840 --> 14:24.960
And my, also my primary interest was in the kind of social systems that might develop within this material container,

14:25.880 --> 14:31.000
because you could have almost any kind of social system you want developing within the economic supports

14:31.000 --> 14:43.160
that are provided by this concept of macro life, the kind of self-reproducing space, mobile space colony.

14:43.740 --> 14:52.780
That is, in a fact, a form of life. It moves, it reproduces, it thinks with its human social component.

14:53.180 --> 14:58.160
What does Zabrowski propose would happen if one of the macro life units were to become too heavily populated,

14:58.160 --> 15:02.660
or if a disagreement were to develop? Listen as he explains the possibilities.

15:03.560 --> 15:15.600
The possibilities seem endless, especially for something like the idea of revolt within the human generations.

15:16.740 --> 15:21.740
Whenever people would get to the point of dissatisfaction with a particular system they have,

15:21.740 --> 15:36.060
they would simply create another macro world container using the resources and help of the parent and create their own society within it.

15:36.580 --> 15:46.260
It seems to me that this would give the kind of conservatism and stability that is demanded by human beings in social systems

15:46.260 --> 15:58.680
as well as the openness and sense of creativity and adventure that seems to be lacking from social systems that become too old and don't want to change.

15:59.640 --> 16:05.820
It seems to be an answer to the problem of what is life for.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.520
More on George Zabrowski's macro life on our next show.

16:16.560 --> 16:25.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:08.460 --> 17:12.320
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:28.020 --> 17:33.320
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.620
And here are your hosts.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.540
This is David Cruz and Bill Vernon.

17:44.940 --> 17:51.880
George Zabrowski's epic science fiction novel, Macro Life, proposes the idea that cultures must leave their dirt worlds in order to develop fully.

17:52.260 --> 17:57.440
We asked Zabrowski why he feels a culture cannot develop fully when it is constrained to a planet's surface.

17:57.440 --> 18:17.560
If the resources of a planet are limited and it has no space-based industry with which to supplement the finitudes of a planetary surface, then I think the culture will suffer primarily because of the finitude.

18:17.560 --> 18:29.680
As I said, an open exploration-oriented, knowledge-oriented renaissance culture deposits a different kind of world in the human heart.

18:30.540 --> 18:37.480
A limited culture deposits an ecological sixties kind of approach in the human heart.

18:37.480 --> 18:41.640
And I think there's a sense of constriction that would develop.

18:42.420 --> 18:46.620
Take the idea of a zero-growth society.

18:48.440 --> 18:54.640
I see that as essentially static, both materially and culturally, in the long run.

18:54.800 --> 18:59.380
It would reach a kind of equilibrium with its environment, recycling everything.

19:00.040 --> 19:05.940
And that would be the end, I would think, of that kind of culture.

19:05.940 --> 19:14.320
The idea of such space colonies has appeared in science fiction, though rarely, but certainly no writer has developed it on the scale that Zabrowski has.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.360
Now there are macro life-like books within the field.

19:20.240 --> 19:24.340
Cities in flight by James Blush is sort of like that.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.580
But the cities don't reproduce.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.780
They are old earth cities that simply have taken to wandering around.

19:33.980 --> 19:37.100
It's proto-macro life of one kind or another.

19:38.020 --> 19:50.180
The ideas have been around, but the kind of coherent, sociocultural approach that I think I've taken in that book, which will be the basis of at least six or seven other novels,

19:50.500 --> 19:59.380
each very vastly different in technique and form from the macro life, just has not been copied by anybody.

19:59.380 --> 20:06.680
The appeal of macro life is that the idea of such grandiose space colonies, as fleshed out by Zabrowski, is new.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.680
It is not a rehashed theme.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.380
In fact, Zabrowski feels the idea may be slow to catch on.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.180
Most science fiction writers still don't see it.

20:17.900 --> 20:22.020
They still feel that we're going to colonize planets on a large scale.

20:22.020 --> 20:28.680
I'm afraid that's a very old imperialistic idea of colonizing.

20:29.380 --> 20:33.520
I think there will be people who will attempt to do something with planets,

20:33.640 --> 20:40.880
especially if we develop terraforming techniques for the transformation of Venus or the moon.

20:42.280 --> 20:48.820
That sort of thing will go on, but frankly, it's very difficult.

20:48.820 --> 20:52.500
It all depends how much energy you have to play around with,

20:52.720 --> 20:59.980
but going to find solar-like planets in other star systems and taking them over,

21:00.720 --> 21:08.100
that really strikes me as a kind of abortion of possible life to come.

21:08.780 --> 21:11.880
That a culture must flee its planet and go into space to bloom,

21:12.300 --> 21:15.740
Zabrowski believes flies in the face of a long tradition in science fiction.

21:16.820 --> 21:21.800
It of course destroys a whole generation of science fictional concepts,

21:22.040 --> 21:27.200
which demand that we colonize the planets of other solar systems,

21:27.580 --> 21:32.260
where I feel if it were possible to do that,

21:32.940 --> 21:36.120
native life might be developing or might one day develop,

21:36.340 --> 21:41.460
and we would be pre-empting possible biological evolution there.

21:42.500 --> 21:47.680
It's pre-empt for all that kind of science fiction, and in fact says that that'll never happen.

21:49.840 --> 21:54.540
A whole science fictional universe dies if you take macro life seriously.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.680
George Zabrowski and the old master, John Campbell, on our next show.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:09.520 --> 22:12.120
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

22:12.120 --> 22:15.280
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:19.440 --> 23:24.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:27.180 --> 23:29.040
And here are your hosts.

23:33.380 --> 23:35.680
This is Bill Vernon and David Cruz.

23:36.120 --> 23:39.180
Science Fiction writer George Zabrowski, still in his 30s,

23:39.360 --> 23:41.720
has produced a monumental novel, Macro Life,

23:42.020 --> 23:46.280
whose style, scope and originality will surely influence science fiction for years.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.540
John W. Campbell Jr. has his indelible stamp on the field of science fiction,

23:50.540 --> 23:54.560
primarily through his 34-year editorship of the magazine Astounding Stories.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.780
Zabrowski actually met Campbell shortly before his death in 1971.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.420
We asked him to tell us a bit about the meeting.

24:23.960 --> 24:29.060
He's a very anxious to have a discussion that would not be him agreeing with me

24:29.060 --> 24:30.780
or me agreeing with him.

24:31.600 --> 24:35.220
He picked up a copy, I think, of Orbit by Damon Knight

24:35.220 --> 24:37.220
and a copy of Fantasy and Science Fiction,

24:37.680 --> 24:43.280
and he said the interesting thing is the writers in these two books write beautifully,

24:43.440 --> 24:44.940
but they don't think very much.

24:44.940 --> 24:49.020
And he said, there's a great problem with science fiction is you have people

24:49.020 --> 24:52.020
who write beautifully and don't think, and you have people who think gorgeously

24:52.020 --> 24:53.180
and can't write.

24:54.020 --> 25:02.820
I was very impressed with Campbell, and he valued disagreement above easy agreement.

25:03.260 --> 25:06.580
He told me, if you agree with me, I'll change my mind.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.400
Some consider Campbell's influence on science fiction,

25:10.600 --> 25:12.940
which bordered on actual dominance during the 1940s,

25:12.940 --> 25:14.620
as a positive development.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.920
Others view his contributions with misgiving.

25:17.480 --> 25:20.280
We asked Zabrowski his opinion on the value of Campbell's influence.

25:20.540 --> 25:21.700
His added comments are interesting.

25:22.720 --> 25:29.020
I think it was positive, and I think his disciples do not make the best case for him.

25:29.440 --> 25:36.840
They do not represent his ideas, and I think that it's the worst of John Campbell's effect

25:36.840 --> 25:44.000
on writers and on the publishing of science fiction that has come in for a deserved attack.

25:45.080 --> 25:50.960
The kind of interpretation of Campbell that makes sense out of Campbell's approach.

25:51.720 --> 25:56.940
I think Greg Benford put it to Campbell, basically wanted broader horizons

25:56.940 --> 26:02.320
and a deeper sense of humanity in his writers.

26:03.100 --> 26:07.200
That's the kind of defense that is not made of John W. Campbell.

26:07.400 --> 26:12.080
I think that John Campbell's legitimate heirs are people like Ursula Gwynne,

26:12.120 --> 26:16.920
Gregory Benford, perhaps Odyssey Clark, Philip K. Dick, Gene Wolfe,

26:17.520 --> 26:25.580
the writers who bring a sense of human character into an area of broader horizons

26:25.580 --> 26:30.340
in ideas and considering the future of science and technology

26:30.340 --> 26:33.540
and considering many of the softer sciences.

26:34.060 --> 26:39.940
I think those are the people who defend Campbell along the lines of,

26:39.980 --> 26:44.280
let's have more hard science and engineering in our fiction

26:44.280 --> 26:47.560
don't really understand what he was trying to do.

26:48.540 --> 26:54.300
I think it was James Blish who said that when you say hard science fiction,

26:54.300 --> 26:58.280
what he meant by it is hard science fiction across board,

26:59.120 --> 27:03.220
hard thinking, fine writing, hard characterization,

27:04.320 --> 27:08.100
that unity of values that I alluded to before,

27:09.200 --> 27:11.520
that's what Campbell really pointed to.

27:11.540 --> 27:18.200
And of course he failed to bring about this kind of science fiction,

27:18.440 --> 27:20.580
although he had some success.

27:21.220 --> 27:24.500
Anybody would have to fail to some degree,

27:25.360 --> 27:33.900
but I think the people who defend Campbell are usually those who turn off the literary or ambitious writer.

27:35.120 --> 27:38.380
A six hour meeting of the minds, John Campbell,

27:38.580 --> 27:43.400
the man who probably more than anyone else set the stage for the kind of science fiction being produced today,

27:43.760 --> 27:48.180
and George Zabrowski, one of today's bright stars destined for greater accomplishment.

27:55.660 --> 27:58.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

27:58.440 --> 28:01.080
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:01.080 --> 28:04.260
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:23.260 --> 28:25.300
Thank you.
