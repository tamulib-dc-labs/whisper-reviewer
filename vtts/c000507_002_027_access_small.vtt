WEBVTT

00:01.660 --> 00:02.160
Call back?

00:03.060 --> 00:07.600
Uh, no. Yeah, fine. Listen, we need to get a voice level on you. Could you tell us what the weather's like out there?

00:07.940 --> 00:10.120
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.

00:10.940 --> 00:12.080
The party's sounding fine.

00:12.660 --> 00:18.760
Okay. Listen, by the way, you know, this is, uh, we edit this show after we tape it, so if you, if you, if there's an interruption, that's fine.

00:18.920 --> 00:19.940
You know, we can just edit it out.

00:20.160 --> 00:21.520
Okay. Um...

00:21.520 --> 00:22.280
Because it's loud as you can.

00:22.740 --> 00:23.640
Okay, can you hear me okay?

00:23.800 --> 00:23.960
Yeah.

00:25.180 --> 00:29.860
Okay, listen, first of all, I wanted to know, uh, did you grow up reading science fiction? Were you a fan?

00:30.660 --> 00:40.960
Yeah, I, uh, I got some old, um, copies of astounding and, uh, F&SF and Galaxy from a couple of college students who are on my paper route.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.040
They gave me about 900 old magazines, which I still have.

00:45.240 --> 00:51.160
So I have volume one number one of a lot of, uh, different, you know, in the first year of F&SF and so forth.

00:51.800 --> 00:55.580
So I started reading in, um, probably in fifth grade.

00:56.780 --> 01:03.660
And, uh, through high school, I, um, contributed to fanzines and I even published a few issues of my own fanzine.

01:03.940 --> 01:06.220
I went to, I think, one science fiction convention.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.960
Met Harlan Ellison and, um, Buck and Juanita Coulson.

01:12.020 --> 01:15.520
Yeah, we thought you might have been a fan just from the way you treated on the air. We weren't sure, though.

01:15.880 --> 01:16.160
Uh-huh.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.600
Uh, well, let me get right to the meat of some of the questions we had.

01:19.900 --> 01:31.020
Um, I guess the tremendous popularity of science fiction and fantasy movies during the summer of 82 and last spring and so forth has been unbelievable and the money they've taken in.

01:31.540 --> 01:33.080
Do you think there's any reason for that popularity?

01:34.140 --> 01:43.620
Uh, yeah, I think that, um, one reason is that science fiction movies are finally getting the special effects that are equal to their content.

01:44.520 --> 01:57.920
Uh, when you would read a science fiction book, you would be able to imagine, uh, astonishing things happening, but then when you would go to the movie, especially, let's say, in the 1950s, when there was the last big science fiction boom, you would see some pretty

01:58.420 --> 02:00.980
transparently awful special effects in most of the movies.

02:01.640 --> 02:08.080
And there were some good ones, some of George Powell's productions, for example, but for the most part, uh, the special effects were laughable.

02:08.080 --> 02:13.420
And so, uh, the movies were not able to do justice to the ideas in the material.

02:14.160 --> 02:28.500
These new science fiction films, uh, starting with, um, well, obviously starting with 2001 and then with Silent Running, which were precursors of the current boom and which for a long time were not followed by any other science, by any other notable science fiction films.

02:29.240 --> 02:38.200
Um, these new films are able to harness enough technology so that the visuals can do justice to the, to the ideas.

02:40.240 --> 02:48.700
Okay, fine. Do you think it's possible to have a science fiction movie which is as great as any other movie, or is it a limited sort of a genre?

02:48.700 --> 02:59.560
Certainly. Um, the British film magazine, Sight and Sound, uh, takes a poll of the world's film critics every ten years to see what are the greatest films of all time.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.920
They've done it in 52, 62, 72, and then they're in the process of doing it again now.

03:04.680 --> 03:12.600
And I fully anticipate that when the tallies are added up, 2001 will be included among the ten greatest films ever made.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.740
Okay, good. Um, do you think E.T. is as good as the money it's taken in indicates?

03:19.840 --> 03:27.060
Uh, the money that E.T. has taken in indicates, um, the nature of the market today.

03:27.280 --> 03:34.980
It was a mass market, very popular family entertainment that came out at summertime with more than a thousand theaters at some point playing the film.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.220
And so it can generate revenues like that because of the nature of the market.

03:39.220 --> 03:43.220
Movie is very good, and I loved it.

03:44.060 --> 03:57.820
And I think it belongs on the same list though, not so much with science fiction movies as with movies like National Velvet, Lassie Come Home, uh, movies about, as many other people have also observed, it's kind of a movie about a boy and his dog in a way.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.040
Uh, it's more of that than science fiction.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.800
I mean, technically, of course it's science fiction, but I think the appeal was not because it was science fiction.

04:06.800 --> 04:14.820
The appeal was because of, uh, identification with this little boy and something that he learns to care for and something that we learn to care for.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.320
What's, uh, what Spielberg got that so captured people's imaginations?

04:20.420 --> 04:27.500
Spielberg has the ability to remember what it was like to be a child.

04:28.660 --> 04:34.580
When I see his movies, and I'm also including, uh, something for example like Raiders of the Lost Art,

04:35.260 --> 04:48.120
I am taken back to the feeling that I had when I would read, uh, pulp science fiction serials in magazines like Trilling Wonder Stories, Starling Stories, and so forth.

04:48.780 --> 04:52.420
And stuff by Haggard and Burroughs and people like that.

04:53.140 --> 05:02.380
He remembers that sense of wonder and is able to communicate it on, and he also remembers what it was like to be a kid.

05:02.380 --> 05:07.700
I think it's interesting that so many of his films have as their, uh, locale, the American suburbs.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.960
And he grew up in a suburb, and you see that suburb in Poltergeist in particular, and in E.T.

05:15.240 --> 05:19.020
Um, what about fantasy as it's distinguished from science fiction?

05:19.180 --> 05:20.640
Have there been any good fantasy movies?

05:21.360 --> 05:28.440
Well, the problem with fantasy is that, um, you know, science fiction is allegedly plausible.

05:29.460 --> 05:34.040
Although we could have a lot of questions about how much, for example, of Star Wars is really plausible.

05:35.760 --> 05:52.420
Fantasy is not supposed to be plausible, but the problem is, um, most fantasy movies seem to be limited to sword and sorcery, uh, types of, you know, Conan the Barbarian, um, the sword and the sorcerer, and movies like that.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.500
Or you get an animated film like Lord of the Rings.

05:56.040 --> 06:04.600
I have not seen, uh, very much of the kind of fantasy, for example, the fantasy and science fiction magazine helped to popularize.

06:06.060 --> 06:14.400
Fantasy in that it has to do with the whimsy of, of magic or impossible things intruding into real life.

06:15.500 --> 06:21.400
Those kinds of movies are hard to do, and, uh, it takes a lot of, it takes a lot of nerve to do them.

06:21.400 --> 06:30.160
It's one thing to have some broad falling out of her leopard skin bikini and some, um, big brood, brood with a sword, you know, and the rippling pectorals and so forth.

06:30.500 --> 06:35.080
But it's another thing, uh, to have the imagination to really create a fantasy.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.680
Yeah, we understand there are two big fantasy movies coming out at Christmas.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.220
Uh, Dark Crystal and Something Wicked this way comes.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.380
Have you, by any chance, seen anything from those?

06:44.640 --> 06:48.460
I haven't seen anything from either one of them except for, uh, some press material.

06:50.060 --> 06:55.900
Okay, just a couple more here. Why, uh, we thought that Blade Runner didn't go over as well as it could have.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.440
Do you think there's any reason for that?

06:57.880 --> 07:05.660
I think the reason for that is that the director never really got interested in the people or androids in his plot.

07:07.440 --> 07:12.480
And, um, the movie was a triumph of set design. It looked great.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.920
It was a very interesting looking vision of the future.

07:15.860 --> 07:27.980
And in particular the notion that, uh, you know, in so many movies or books, um, uh, at least in, you know, we're not talking about maybe people who are really familiar with the whole field of science fiction,

07:28.040 --> 07:39.600
but to the general public, the science fiction future is this wonderful stainless steel and four-mic placed with towers and rockets, uh, jetting around and everybody dressed like a hospital intern and so forth.

07:39.600 --> 07:44.860
And this movie had the imagination to suggest that 40 years from now things are going to be 40 years older.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.040
The pollution is going to be 40 years, uh, worse.

07:48.820 --> 07:51.220
Poverty is going to be 40 years more deeply ingrained.

07:51.540 --> 07:55.160
Crime will be 40 years, um, more ubiquitous and so forth.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.640
That was a very interesting vision.

07:57.120 --> 08:06.240
I do feel, though, that the really interesting thing about Blade Runner and probably about the Philip K. Dick, uh, material that it started from,

08:07.020 --> 08:10.860
was, uh, centered around the question of what is human, you know?

08:11.400 --> 08:16.780
If the memories that I have are not of a life that I lived, does that make them any less my memories?

08:17.940 --> 08:22.720
And Harrison Ford, when I interviewed him, uh, said much the same thing, that that's what attracted him to the material.

08:23.300 --> 08:33.460
The dilemma of which of these people were human and which of these people were not is, as far as their minds were concerned, they all had the same kind of, uh, background to call on.

08:33.920 --> 08:37.960
I think that that theme kind of got lost in the middle of those great special effects.

08:38.240 --> 08:47.500
And if the movie had really been willing to follow through on the value questions that it raised, it might have been a more interesting movie.

08:48.740 --> 08:55.960
Now, the irony is that I think that, uh, one of the reasons it wasn't as successful as it might have been is because it didn't follow through on those questions.

08:56.100 --> 09:01.380
And yet, from what I understand, that material was cut out of the movie because they figured it wouldn't be box office.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.300
It's better just to have the special effects.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.240
Yeah, that's very good. Excellent.

09:06.700 --> 09:09.580
Um, listen, what about the future of science fiction in the movies?

09:09.700 --> 09:13.060
Back in the 50s, there was a big science fiction boom that was reflected in the cinema.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.520
And of course, the last couple of years, there's been a tremendous boom.

09:15.920 --> 09:20.180
Do you think it's peaked out and it's going to go down or is there a great future for science fiction movies?

09:21.720 --> 09:24.420
Uh, this is a different kind of boom than the 50s boom.

09:25.500 --> 09:34.020
For the most part, the exception of movies like Fantastic Planet and Destination Moon, the 50s science fiction boom was a B movie boom.

09:34.280 --> 09:39.180
Most of those pictures were made for double features or for drive-ins.

09:39.300 --> 09:44.160
A lot of them were made by American International on a very low budget.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.000
They were exploitation pictures.

09:46.920 --> 09:54.220
The movies that are being made today are among the all-time top-grossing films ever made, indicating a really deep-seated desire

09:54.220 --> 09:55.940
on the part of the audience to go see them.

09:56.840 --> 10:02.900
Another difference is that in the 50s, to a degree, even though television was around in the 50s,

10:02.920 --> 10:10.540
to a degree, the American people were still going to movies out of habits that they brought over from the pre-television era.

10:10.720 --> 10:17.100
Today, the basic moviegoer is 19 years old and more than half of all moviegoers are under the age of 25.

10:17.680 --> 10:23.020
So you have different demographics in the audience and these younger people have traditionally been more interested in science fiction.

10:23.960 --> 10:33.040
So that I think that the big budget science fiction blockbuster is going to continue to be a phenomenon indefinitely.

10:33.780 --> 10:37.140
Now the question is, what about the little pictures that use a certain amount of imagination?

10:37.500 --> 10:41.900
What about a picture like L.Q. Jones's A Boy and His Dog?

10:43.140 --> 10:54.860
What about a film like the Harvey Kytel picture where the man has the television cameras implanted in his eyes

10:54.860 --> 11:02.740
and he follows around the woman who thinks she's dying of an incurable disease, Bertrand Tavernier directed it.

11:02.760 --> 11:03.280
Can you remember the name?

11:04.300 --> 11:05.480
No, I can't.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.620
Well, I think it's Death Watch.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.620
That's a wonderful science fiction film, basically on an idea.

11:13.800 --> 11:20.140
In other words, there are no special effects in it except the idea that the guy has television eyes, which you can't see, of course.

11:22.300 --> 11:26.820
You get some point of view shots showing what he sees as kind of like a grid or something.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.920
That was a great idea for a movie.

11:29.920 --> 11:37.980
I wonder what the future of those films will be since the big hardware pictures and the mass market pictures seem to be really well established.

11:38.720 --> 11:44.360
I think you might agree with me though that some of the best science fiction material is more suited to a smaller form.

11:44.480 --> 11:49.120
For example, I would love to see a film based on The People by Zena Henderson.

11:50.920 --> 11:51.560
By whom?

11:52.180 --> 11:53.100
Zena Henderson.

11:53.420 --> 11:54.480
Oh yeah, The People stories.

11:54.780 --> 11:54.920
Yeah.

11:57.320 --> 12:01.680
They tried that on television about four or five years ago, if I remember correctly.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.000
Oh really?

12:02.500 --> 12:02.900
Yeah.

12:03.720 --> 12:04.460
That's television.

12:07.260 --> 12:15.040
William Shatner and Kim Darby, and they took a hodge podge of about four or five of her stories and put them together.

12:15.460 --> 12:16.080
Were they any good?

12:17.840 --> 12:18.560
Sort of.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.660
I didn't, I missed that.

12:21.340 --> 12:26.300
I go to the movies and so much that I hardly ever, you know, I'm never at home during prime time.

12:26.380 --> 12:27.440
I'm always out in a movie theater.

12:28.540 --> 12:44.920
Yeah, I was going to ask you, you're right, sometimes they can't show the intimate little things on the in science fiction except on television, like the Electric Grandmother, which was just on PBS.

12:44.920 --> 12:45.240
Yes.

12:46.040 --> 13:00.200
Do you think that maybe the small film just can't make it because they stay so much in the shadow of the big science fiction films?

13:03.620 --> 13:11.240
Well, I think that the problem that Hollywood has always had with any small offbeat picture is they can't figure out how they're going to sell it.

13:11.240 --> 13:16.360
Now, one thing we have to remember is that the two Spielberg hits this summer were inexpensive pictures.

13:17.060 --> 13:23.600
PolarEyes and ET were both brought in for not much more than ten million dollars.

13:24.700 --> 13:31.500
And you know, today the average Hollywood production, the average movie cost between seven and eight million dollars.

13:32.180 --> 13:35.380
So the ten million dollars is not much to spend on a movie.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.280
It seems like a lot, of course, but a ten million dollar picture today.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.900
In many cases could have been made for one or two million dollars ten years ago.

13:44.960 --> 13:49.840
So in a way, Spielberg, with those two pictures, has not spent tons of money.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.440
A boy in his dog does have a life though, sort of an underground midnight movie.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.780
Yeah, that's where all those movies turn up.

13:56.820 --> 13:58.480
Another one of my favorites is Zardaz.

14:00.700 --> 14:04.980
And that plays in the revival theaters, but it never found an audience the first time around.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.120
Okay, I've just got about two more.

14:09.300 --> 14:17.140
Do you think that the public's fascination with science fiction movies is anyway related to, say, the space program,

14:17.440 --> 14:21.260
the realization that we've got to clean up our act or get off the earth or things of that sort?

14:25.540 --> 14:25.980
Um...

14:27.420 --> 14:27.860
No.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.120
No, I don't think so.

14:31.120 --> 14:37.300
I think maybe some of the fascination with 2001 might have been because it came out at a time

14:37.300 --> 14:42.420
when amazing things were happening in space and we were getting ready to land on the moon and so forth.

14:43.200 --> 14:49.920
But I believe that the space movies today, like Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back,

14:51.640 --> 14:57.620
are identified with primarily in the same way that Rage of the Lost Ark is, as a pick-a-resk adventure.

14:58.820 --> 15:07.660
And when we talk about science fiction, I gather that you and I both kind of tacitly did not include horror films.

15:09.020 --> 15:09.240
Right.

15:09.300 --> 15:13.800
I think a psychiatrist might say something like this, or at least I've heard this theory.

15:14.700 --> 15:20.620
It's not so much that the space films indicate our feeling that there's a new frontier to be conquered,

15:21.240 --> 15:24.720
as that the monster films indicate our fear of technology.

15:24.720 --> 15:29.980
And there is an old theory that at any time when mankind, in recent years, in the 20th century,

15:30.080 --> 15:36.960
when people, when the public has begun, has started to feel threatened by the bomb or by technology,

15:37.220 --> 15:41.440
then you get a lot of horror pictures because the messy seems to be science will get out of control.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.880
Science will kill us, you know.

15:43.960 --> 15:48.800
There'll be some kind of a virus or giant grasshoppers or something will happen.

15:48.800 --> 15:55.580
And, you know, scanners or other terrible things will be unleashed upon the population.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.720
Yeah, the science fiction people sort of call out the Frankenstein conflicts.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.860
I think you're, that's probably right.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.400
Yeah, listen, I'll tell you one thing that's happening.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.480
I'm getting awfully bored by the special effects makeup.

16:09.280 --> 16:18.620
You know, it's only been about 18 months since the big breakthroughs of, oh, like American werewolf in London,

16:18.620 --> 16:19.620
and so forth.

16:20.740 --> 16:24.700
And already you can, you know, you get the close up of the face and the job against the pulsate

16:24.700 --> 16:28.080
and then the face begins to expand and there's a face inside trying to get out.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.900
I've seen it now, you know.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.720
I've seen it so many times that it's boring.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.800
I want to get on with the story.

16:35.220 --> 16:38.680
Yeah, do you think that might have been the problem with Carpenters the Thing?

16:39.540 --> 16:41.500
Well, it really had an interesting monster.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.540
But it didn't really have people.

16:49.480 --> 16:55.500
I didn't really feel much concern about the characters in the Thing.

16:56.260 --> 17:01.980
And another thing that bothered me, you know, years ago in science fiction fandom, they had the so-called idiot plot.

17:03.120 --> 17:07.660
The plot that can only last as long as the movie because everyone in the movie is an idiot.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.920
Because if somebody wasn't an idiot, they would figure out what to do and do it.

17:11.560 --> 17:20.280
And in the Thing, the characters have an annoying persistent tendency to not do what everyone in the audience knows they should be doing.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.300
You know, they split up. They go outside.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.420
They say, you stay right here because I know I can take care of myself.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.240
They trust each other.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.500
They do not keep a sense of who was where, when, and why.

17:33.740 --> 17:40.160
In a group of people like that with military discipline, the moment that they figured out what they were up against,

17:40.160 --> 17:45.620
if they had instilled watertight discipline upon themselves, they would have been a lot better off.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.700
But the movie depends upon everybody being an idiot.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.100
That's very good. You're exactly right.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.180
Well, listen, we wanted to ask you before we let you go.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.580
We knew that you were going to be doing a new show, that that PBS one, you were going off of that.

17:59.780 --> 18:02.360
But we haven't got any information about where and when and what.

18:03.100 --> 18:07.160
Well, Gene Siskel and I, last week previews, we started a show called At the Movies.

18:08.040 --> 18:11.380
It has a similar structure. We review new films.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.160
Instead of Spot the Wonder Dog, we now have Aroma the Educated Skunk.

18:16.060 --> 18:20.920
And we are on in 86 markets around the country, including most of the top 50 markets.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.660
Where are you calling from again?

18:24.240 --> 18:28.020
Well, that's the Texas. We picked you up on the PBS channel here from Dallas.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.640
Dallas? We're on in Dallas.

18:30.780 --> 18:35.200
We are on in Dallas, Fort Worth on KTXA. It's Saturday at 3.30 p.m.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.460
No, we don't get KTXA. Dog on it.

18:39.400 --> 18:43.060
Well, maybe one of our stations out here will pick you up.

18:44.100 --> 18:44.980
No, we missed it.

18:44.980 --> 18:45.880
What is the station nearest you?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.180
KMID, K...

18:49.180 --> 18:49.740
What city?

18:50.180 --> 18:50.600
Odessa?

18:51.060 --> 18:54.700
Odessa Midland, KMID and KTPX.

18:55.660 --> 18:56.260
Where's that?

18:56.440 --> 18:57.740
And KOZA. They're all local.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.040
ABCNBC and CBS affiliates here.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.740
They're all in Odessa. I'm looking at this list here.

19:03.740 --> 19:07.240
Odessa Midland. It could be either one. KTPX, KMID.

19:07.260 --> 19:09.780
Is it Desus Lubbock?

19:10.240 --> 19:10.420
No.

19:10.880 --> 19:11.920
What station in Lubbock?

19:13.640 --> 19:14.740
We haven't sold Lubbock.

19:15.140 --> 19:15.520
Oh, okay.

19:18.900 --> 19:26.580
Well, I don't know. We're doing very well. We've gotten three times the ratings that we had before.

19:26.920 --> 19:30.420
Well, your other show was excellent quality. We're going to miss that.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.000
Maybe we can start a little letter writing thing out here, see if we can get a hold of it.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.440
Well, it's called At the Movies and it's put out by Tribune Productions at WGN in Chicago.

19:38.200 --> 19:38.240
Yeah.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.680
And we're very happy. I guess it looks pretty successful from our point of view.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.180
Yeah. Listen, are you going to...

19:44.180 --> 19:44.700
Where's Waco, Texas?

19:46.520 --> 19:46.900
Waco.

19:48.100 --> 19:48.980
What do I know?

19:50.200 --> 19:50.580
Waco.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.320
I'm from Texas.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.460
Most of the people from Waco are Waco, though.

19:54.680 --> 19:59.100
Oh, I believe that. Anyway, we are... It's called At the Movies and it is on the air.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.160
Okay, and you're going to be staying with the Chicago Sun-Times, all right?

20:02.160 --> 20:02.300
Yeah.

20:02.620 --> 20:06.660
Yeah, okay. Well, listen, we appreciate your time. We know how valuable it must be.

20:07.020 --> 20:10.560
And when we get these edited into our shows, we'll send you copies of the cassettes.

20:10.740 --> 20:11.200
Thanks a lot.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.820
And thank you very much, Mr. Ebert.

20:12.880 --> 20:13.660
You bet. Bye-bye.

20:13.760 --> 20:14.380
Bye-bye.
