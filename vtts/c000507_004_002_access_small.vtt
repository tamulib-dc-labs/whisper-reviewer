WEBVTT

00:02.420 --> 00:03.760
No, you can sit over here.

00:04.020 --> 00:05.320
Okay, the tape is on.

00:06.820 --> 00:12.380
We have a visitor tonight, my wife, who read the book and loved it, so she wanted to sit

00:12.380 --> 00:12.960
in and listen.

00:13.440 --> 00:13.960
Oh, fine.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.060
See what an author sounds like.

00:17.020 --> 00:19.060
Okay, as I said, the tape is on.

00:20.140 --> 00:25.140
Why an novel featuring both vampires and the Mississippi Riverboat era?

00:26.060 --> 00:30.320
Well, I could say why not, but that would be evading the issue.

00:32.960 --> 00:41.880
Essentially the vampires came first in my own personal...the vampires came first as I was

00:41.880 --> 00:42.780
putting the book together.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.240
I had read a fair amount about vampires.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.600
I had read other people's vampire novels, for example, Dracula, as one of the other

00:49.600 --> 00:50.500
books done recently.

00:50.500 --> 00:56.260
I had wanted to do my own version of that legend for some time, because I had a few

00:56.800 --> 00:57.960
ideas about it.

00:58.320 --> 01:04.180
But I didn't want it to be just another Dracula book, just another rehash of the same old

01:04.180 --> 01:09.500
legends, because we've seen vampire books after vampire books that are essentially just

01:09.500 --> 01:12.920
the same things spun over and over again, and I think that's tiresome.

01:13.740 --> 01:18.140
At the same time I was going through all these thoughts about vampires was the period that

01:18.140 --> 01:19.540
I was living in Dubuque, Iowa.

01:20.460 --> 01:24.640
I taught college there for three years, and Dubuque, of course, is an old river town.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.140
It was once a big steamboat manufacturing center, and it's still very much imbued with

01:30.140 --> 01:33.720
the old history of the great era of steam on the Mississippi.

01:35.260 --> 01:42.040
So it was during that period while I was in Dubuque that I got interested in the...that

01:42.040 --> 01:42.780
period of history.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.260
I got interested in the steamboat.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.020
I read a fair amount about them.

01:46.020 --> 01:49.560
And once I did, the two things just seemed to come together in my mind.

01:51.040 --> 01:59.660
There's a certain romanticism, I think, a dark romanticism that clings to both the old steamboats

01:59.660 --> 02:00.360
and vampires.

02:01.100 --> 02:07.700
They're both very attractive in a certain sense, the elegant vampire and the stately,

02:09.140 --> 02:12.840
intricate, gorgeous steamboat, but they also have dark sides too, of course.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.100
It's obvious in the case of the vampire, in the case of the steamboat, they were very

02:17.100 --> 02:18.220
dangerous most of the travel.

02:18.700 --> 02:25.560
They were always blowing up and oiler explosions, fires, having a bomb torn out by the river.

02:26.160 --> 02:31.580
It was a tumultuous time, and the river towns were rough, dangerous places.

02:32.380 --> 02:39.300
You had towns like Natchez on the hill, for example, which Natchez under the hill, the

02:39.300 --> 02:44.180
kind of double city of Natchez that existed at that time and is referred to in the book.

02:44.780 --> 02:53.500
And it seems to me that's a literal metaphor for the vampirism, the two natures, good and

02:53.500 --> 02:56.660
bad, together in one entity.

03:00.980 --> 03:07.800
Why do you think vampires are so attractive to people through the years they've been popular

03:07.800 --> 03:09.820
and it seems like now they're really popular?

03:10.000 --> 03:10.860
What, why is that?

03:12.500 --> 03:14.040
That's an interesting question.

03:17.420 --> 03:23.500
Vampires are an almost universal legend, which is one thing that turned out when I was researching

03:23.500 --> 03:24.220
Fever Dream.

03:26.060 --> 03:32.800
The vampires we're familiar with, of course, Dracula and his kin, so to speak, and all the

03:32.800 --> 03:37.440
books that are derived from that tradition are essentially retreads of Eastern European,

03:38.080 --> 03:41.500
Romanian, Hungarian, largely vampire legends.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.200
But if you look around the world, you'll find vampire legends everywhere.

03:45.820 --> 03:51.440
In China, in Africa, in the South Seas, there are variants of the vampire legend.

03:51.560 --> 03:58.400
The details differ, but the basic vision of a nocturnal predator that preys on human beings

03:58.400 --> 04:00.200
is present in all of these.

04:01.160 --> 04:07.180
And so that would lead you to wonder why do they have this universal appeal.

04:07.620 --> 04:14.540
The easy answer is to why they're appealing in our culture today in modern American mass

04:14.540 --> 04:23.540
society, I think, is the sexual nature of the vampire, the sexual symbolism embodied in

04:23.540 --> 04:27.520
Dracula and in the way it's been treated by Hollywood.

04:27.960 --> 04:35.560
The symbolism of vampire as a seductor is, um,

04:39.740 --> 04:46.980
appeals to something within us and gives legend a lot more resonances than, say, the

04:46.980 --> 04:53.240
werewolf legend or zombies or some of the other things that have never really achieved

04:53.240 --> 04:55.160
the popularity of the vampire legend.

04:57.900 --> 05:03.280
But then you could say, well, that's true for us, but it doesn't explain why the legend

05:03.280 --> 05:04.840
is so universal around the world.

05:05.220 --> 05:07.460
And indeed, it doesn't, but I don't have an answer for that.

05:08.100 --> 05:12.200
In the terms of fever dream, I looked at that universality and I made it one of the bases

05:12.820 --> 05:14.480
when I started writing the novel.

05:14.760 --> 05:19.180
I said, what if the reason that these legends are universal is because they're all remembering

05:19.180 --> 05:20.040
the same thing.

05:20.240 --> 05:27.620
They're all remembering some kind of racial memory of a real man-like, predatory animal,

05:28.280 --> 05:33.460
blood drinker that is somehow the basis for all the vampire legends.

05:33.780 --> 05:36.440
And that was the premise that I, of course, used in the fever dream.

05:39.200 --> 05:44.620
You incorporated some of the traditional vampire elements such as they couldn't come out in the

05:44.620 --> 05:49.620
middle of the day, but yes, some of the others, they couldn't see their, well, you couldn't

05:49.620 --> 05:54.080
see their images in a mirror, the fear of silver, I assume garlic was out, whatever.

05:54.920 --> 05:59.960
Was this kind of a conscious sifting through the vampire traditions and settling on ones

05:59.960 --> 06:03.800
that seemed reasonable and others that just seemed like they would just be fantasy or

06:03.800 --> 06:04.700
hearsay about vampires?

06:05.220 --> 06:06.000
Yeah, more or less.

06:06.420 --> 06:08.160
I wanted to have rationalized vampires.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.640
I wanted to have vampires that I thought could actually exist,

06:13.580 --> 06:20.200
that were not based on, you know, vague supernatural legends and down over the years.

06:20.440 --> 06:25.480
So I had to look at each of the particular beliefs associated with vampires and see,

06:25.540 --> 06:29.920
is there any way that I could justify this in a rational manner?

06:30.100 --> 06:35.380
Now, obviously something about vampires not coming out during day, which the vampires in my book

06:35.380 --> 06:38.100
Fever Dream do have that characteristic.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.580
Well, that's very easily explainable.

06:40.580 --> 06:43.840
It's just they're nocturnal creatures.

06:45.040 --> 06:51.500
Their skin is extremely sensitive to ultraviolet, so they burn very badly if they're exposed to

06:51.500 --> 06:54.440
daylight, so they avoid it.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.120
You can justify that easily.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.760
But you look at something they're not reflected in mirrors.

07:00.080 --> 07:04.320
I mean, there's no way to justify not being reflected in mirrors scientifically.

07:04.320 --> 07:10.440
You have to rewrite essentially all the laws governing light and reflection and refraction

07:10.440 --> 07:11.080
and so on.

07:11.340 --> 07:14.300
That's strictly a supernatural motif, so I had to get rid of that.

07:15.700 --> 07:19.560
Obviously, considering that the book is about vampires on Mississippi Ribs Steamboats,

07:20.260 --> 07:24.000
I had to get rid of the one that said they can't cross running water as well,

07:24.140 --> 07:26.940
and they sail up and down the steamboat all through the book.

07:30.520 --> 07:35.860
Your concept of the red thirst, which came up on the vampires periodically, was something I had

07:35.860 --> 07:37.840
not run into before in Vampire Legends.

07:38.420 --> 07:43.760
That, again, I would assume was part of the rationalizing their existence in this world,

07:43.760 --> 07:45.700
as opposed to just the fantasy vampires.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.000
More or less, yeah.

07:49.500 --> 07:54.460
And it was also part of what I was trying to do with Fever Dream thematically.

07:56.940 --> 07:58.660
I suppose as much as anything else.

07:58.900 --> 08:03.520
I mean, the book is about vampires on Mississippi Ribs Steamboats, but in a deeper sense,

08:03.780 --> 08:05.480
it's about moral choices.

08:06.260 --> 08:10.340
And one of the things that Joshua York, the vampire, says to Abner,

08:11.300 --> 08:15.000
Abner Marsh, the protagonist, and that Abner later says back to him is,

08:15.600 --> 08:16.660
you make your choices.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.220
We all make our choices.

08:19.400 --> 08:24.600
If you take the traditional vampire thing, the traditional vampire believes the traditional

08:24.600 --> 08:25.600
vision of the vampire.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.880
You don't have choice.

08:29.660 --> 08:35.700
The vampire is an avatar of undying, ancient, and absolutely black evil.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.400
Well, okay, fine.

08:40.540 --> 08:45.900
That makes for good entertainment, but as it interacts with the real world,

08:46.100 --> 08:47.380
kind of a hollow construct.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.000
The real world is made up of graves.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.760
I think real people are made up of graves.

08:52.940 --> 08:54.160
We don't have absolute goods.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.320
And we don't have absolute evils.

08:56.540 --> 09:02.280
It's a good and evil that we have resides in each of us, and it is a matter of moral choice.

09:02.900 --> 09:09.280
So that's why the book is constructed around four characters, two human beings and two vampires.

09:12.780 --> 09:17.560
But issues of good and evil are not easily broken down.

09:17.900 --> 09:22.300
There are good human beings and good vampires in the terms of the book.

09:22.300 --> 09:27.940
And there is a bad vampire and evil vampire, but also an evil human being.

09:28.720 --> 09:34.440
So the four characters, four major characters, Abner, Joshua, Damon, Julian, and Sourbilly,

09:34.640 --> 09:41.700
Tipton all kind of reflect and interact with each other in what I hope are interesting ways.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.000
When did Julian make his choice?

09:45.500 --> 09:51.420
Just eons ago, or did he ever really think about making a choice as far as this moral choice?

09:52.100 --> 09:57.440
Well, he did make a choice eons ago, but he also makes the choice in terms of the book at the banquet

09:57.440 --> 10:01.040
when he essentially rejects what Joshua has to offer.

10:04.760 --> 10:09.740
And states his opposition to Joshua with saying, you know, we are born.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.280
This is what we are born to be.

10:14.020 --> 10:19.120
Masters over humanity, people who take the lives of those inferior to us.

10:21.420 --> 10:22.340
And this is our nature.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.140
So he is making a choice there.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.300
He's rejecting Joshua's potion.

10:27.520 --> 10:31.640
He's rejecting the freedom from the red thirst Joshua offers.

10:31.860 --> 10:36.940
And he's accepting what he thinks is of his superior nature.

10:38.500 --> 10:44.200
Of course, there's also certain, you know, resonances there with the whole slavery thing,

10:44.260 --> 10:46.760
which I tried to put through all the way through the book.

10:46.760 --> 10:52.420
It takes place in the antebellum South, late antebellum South.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.200
And slavery, of course, is very hot then.

10:56.340 --> 11:02.380
And the whole master slave thing that existed between blacks and whites in the South then

11:03.080 --> 11:08.360
has a kind of a fancy reflection in relations between vampires and human beings.

11:11.240 --> 11:15.440
Captain Marsh was a character that I really liked.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.640
And I think he's one of the strongest characters you've come up with in your writing.

11:20.340 --> 11:25.660
Did he occur to you early or did he occur to you as you started doing the research

11:25.660 --> 11:27.460
and we're looking for a strong protagonist?

11:28.720 --> 11:32.800
Well, like any character, I think in a work of fiction like a novel,

11:32.800 --> 11:34.520
Abner Marsh just grew.

11:35.420 --> 11:39.700
I mean, I had the basic outlines of the character when I started the book.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.620
But the more you write about it, the more you learn and get to know the character.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.020
And you go back later and you do subsequent drafts,

11:47.020 --> 11:50.380
changing some of the stuff that goes earlier on.

11:52.100 --> 11:57.940
By the time I finished Fever Dream, I was thoroughly enraptured with Abner,

11:58.020 --> 12:01.020
who was a character that I liked very much also.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.040
And I'm glad he came across as well.

12:05.920 --> 12:13.000
There are certain real riverboat captains who were loose models for Abner Marsh.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.860
But he's not modeled strictly on any one person.

12:18.040 --> 12:24.300
I took a couple characteristics from one famous steamboat captain and a couple from another.

12:24.820 --> 12:30.560
And just a couple from other people that I knew and sort of mixed them together

12:30.560 --> 12:31.640
and came up with Abner.

12:41.480 --> 12:45.240
One thing you mentioned to Captain Marsh and then the slavery,

12:45.440 --> 12:51.020
I thought one thing that made it effective was Captain Marsh's essential neutrality

12:51.020 --> 12:53.860
towards slavery and then things kind of slowly dawned on him.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.540
He wasn't up on a soapbox, either pro or against.

12:58.060 --> 13:01.120
And so it didn't come across as preachy.

13:01.420 --> 13:04.120
And that was appreciated by the reader, definitely.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.380
Oh, thank you.

13:07.360 --> 13:12.500
Well, of course, that was the intention that Marsh's exposure to Joshua

13:13.820 --> 13:21.260
and exposure to the whole night folks, as he calls them, or vampires,

13:23.960 --> 13:24.760
changes him.

13:25.280 --> 13:29.920
It makes him a much different man at the end than at the beginning.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.900
Abner Marsh is never an evil man.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.520
I think by nature he is a good man.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.940
But he is a man at the beginning of a book who's essentially just living his own life.

13:40.500 --> 13:49.040
And they degrade moral issues of his time like slavery are things he kind of hashes out over the dinner table,

13:49.040 --> 13:52.680
but never has any great personal involvement in.

13:55.820 --> 14:00.760
But as a result of the whole experience with the steamer, Fever Dream, and the things that

14:00.760 --> 14:05.320
happen to him, I think Marsh changes and becomes, in essence, man is much more aware of,

14:05.460 --> 14:06.940
necessitates make moral choices.

14:10.900 --> 14:18.920
Fever Dream is a storehouse of historical fact and fact and descriptions and that sort of

14:18.920 --> 14:19.240
thing.

14:19.960 --> 14:25.840
I assume you spent a lot of time researching this before you actually sat down to write it.

14:27.580 --> 14:31.040
I did about, it took me two years to do Fever Dream altogether.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.300
The first year of that was largely research.

14:35.840 --> 14:44.500
I did not research at, you know, eight hours every day, but I was still teaching at the

14:44.500 --> 14:48.060
Duke during the period where I actually began to research.

14:48.340 --> 14:50.140
But I did a fair amount of it.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.680
As I said, it did take me a year.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.320
I read considerably in the field.

14:53.620 --> 15:00.200
I traveled on as many of the existing steamboats as I could, those that still fly the Mississippi

15:00.200 --> 15:00.860
River system.

15:01.380 --> 15:08.260
And I went to various cities where scenes from the book take place, St. Louis, New Orleans,

15:08.640 --> 15:09.760
Louisville, so forth.

15:10.680 --> 15:16.180
There's a steamboat museum there, walked the streets to get a little feel of, especially

15:16.180 --> 15:19.600
in the older sections of town, like the French Quarter in New Orleans.

15:21.140 --> 15:23.200
A lot of research did go into it, yes.

15:24.420 --> 15:29.500
I think that's a necessity if you're going to do justice to any sort of historical fiction.

15:30.640 --> 15:35.680
Fever Dream, of course, is historical horror, but I still thank you to all your readers that

15:36.420 --> 15:40.560
get some accuracy in so far as you're capable of it.

15:41.880 --> 15:45.400
Was there ever a riverboat as grand as the Fever Dream?

15:47.140 --> 15:48.120
Oh, yes.

15:49.720 --> 15:56.140
The dimensions of the Fever Dream and the capacity of her engines and so forth are modeled very

15:56.140 --> 15:57.180
closely on the eclipse.

15:58.420 --> 16:03.360
In terms of the book, the eclipse is the queen of the river, the fastest, largest,

16:03.360 --> 16:09.140
and most luxurious boat, and it's the one Abner Marsh aspires to displace as

16:09.140 --> 16:12.460
fastest steamer on the river, and that's why he built the Fever Dream.

16:13.040 --> 16:20.660
The eclipse was a real historical boat of its era, the 1850s, and was considered

16:22.040 --> 16:23.840
the fastest boat of that era.

16:24.020 --> 16:27.680
It did indeed win a very famous steamboat race against the Shotwell.

16:30.260 --> 16:36.280
And some people, including Mark Twain, put forward evidence that the Fever Dream was, in fact,

16:36.580 --> 16:43.080
the fastest steamer ever on the river, and there were later steamers in the 1870s and the 1880s

16:43.080 --> 16:49.880
that, while they were not perhaps as fast as the Fever Dream in the book or the Eclipse in real life,

16:49.880 --> 17:00.540
were even more luxurious, like the J.M. White, very fast and incredibly luxurious steamer of the

17:01.520 --> 17:02.720
1870s, 1880s.

17:05.340 --> 17:12.000
I was surprised at the lack of longevity of the steamboats.

17:12.100 --> 17:14.000
They just didn't last very long, did they?

17:14.380 --> 17:15.020
No, they did.

17:15.020 --> 17:21.160
That was one of the interesting things that turned up when I was researching it, that kind of startled

17:21.160 --> 17:23.680
me, too. I mean, they're such formidable-looking structures.

17:24.240 --> 17:36.280
You'd think they'd be around for ages, but in fact, they had a shorter lifespan than the modern card.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.300
Hold on a second. Someone's on my door. Can you turn off the recorder, Sek?

17:42.540 --> 17:43.060
No problem.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.020
Hello, still?

17:59.860 --> 18:02.180
Yes, sir. Here I am now. Okay, the tape is back on.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.900
Fever Dream, as I recall, is what they used to call a stretch of the river.

18:10.480 --> 18:16.620
Was that a town? For some reason, it escaped me. I didn't write this down. What Fever Dream was

18:16.620 --> 18:18.540
before the book, where he got the name?

18:19.140 --> 18:22.320
Oh, well, I guess I'll ask his dad.

18:22.780 --> 18:27.960
Well, Christy, title of the book is taken from the name of the steamboat in the book. The Fever

18:27.960 --> 18:33.540
Dream is named Steamboat. And the reason after Marsh names the Steamboat Fever Dream is because

18:33.540 --> 18:37.940
it is the boat he has always dreamed of having, the grand, luxurious, fast steamer.

18:37.940 --> 18:43.460
And because he is the president, his company is called Fever River Package Company,

18:43.740 --> 18:51.760
with that odd spelling the RE inverted. He was born in Galena, Illinois.

18:53.260 --> 18:58.260
And the river Galena is located on a small tributary that comes off the Mississippi,

18:58.700 --> 19:05.320
which originally was named the Fever River, F-E-V-R-E River, in the early 1800s.

19:06.080 --> 19:12.360
And Marsh, of course, was born during that period and grew up calling it, in point of fact,

19:12.760 --> 19:19.840
and this is all historically true, the name of that river was changed to Galena River fairly

19:19.840 --> 19:25.240
early on because the town got respectable and they didn't want people thinking they were all sick

19:25.240 --> 19:30.140
there. So they thought it would be better to call it the Galena River. But Galena was a very important

19:30.140 --> 19:35.260
steamboat town and the Fever in its early days, today it's nothing but a creek, it's completely

19:35.260 --> 19:41.140
silted up and I've visited it and you couldn't get a robot to hop it, let alone a major steamer.

19:41.660 --> 19:49.240
But in the early 1800s, Galena was a major steamboat port and the Fever or the Galena

19:49.240 --> 19:56.360
River as it later became was a very bustling little tributary indeed. And a lot of traffic

19:56.360 --> 19:59.980
went up and down it. There was no real Fever River Package Company.

20:03.820 --> 20:09.620
I heard and love it, George Proctor talking to you about the cover of the book. He said it

20:09.620 --> 20:15.500
wouldn't help sell the book. I guess I'll ask, first of all, does an author have any say so

20:15.940 --> 20:20.420
in a cover? Second of all, does it really matter? And thirdly, what did you think of the cover of

20:20.420 --> 20:27.420
Fever Dream? First of all, does the author have any say so? The author has minimal say so.

20:27.420 --> 20:34.900
They will ask the author for advice in some cases and I'd say maybe once out of four times they'll

20:34.900 --> 20:39.360
ask the author. But that doesn't mean they pay any attention to anything the author might say

20:39.360 --> 20:44.380
after they ask him. In the case of Fever Dream, I think it's the best cover I've ever gotten and

20:44.380 --> 20:50.140
I think George is absolutely dead wrong in that. It's a wonderful cover. I have the original

20:50.140 --> 20:56.380
art which I've purchased now hanging on my wall. It is an inaccurate cover in one respect. The

20:56.380 --> 21:01.620
steamboat that is portrayed on the cover is a stern wheeler when the Fever Dream in the book is a

21:01.620 --> 21:05.700
side wheeler which was much more common, the side wheelers are the class boats of the river.

21:06.200 --> 21:11.860
But it's still a marvelously executed cover, I think, and a lovely subtle,

21:13.560 --> 21:20.100
the kind of ghostboat look and the reflection of the vampire in the water. And as for not selling

21:20.100 --> 21:24.820
the book, well, the book is already in its second printing and seems to be doing very well. It's

21:24.820 --> 21:29.400
gotten the best reviews I've ever gotten in my career. So I'm very happy with the way it's selling

21:29.400 --> 21:40.960
so far. Great. Are you a fan of Lord Byron by any chance? Yeah. Byron and Shelley, the Romantics.

21:45.720 --> 21:53.060
Okay. You mentioned that you had started working on this book when you were in Dubuque. How did it

21:53.060 --> 21:58.140
fit in with the writing of the other books that have come out? Did you weave its writing in and

21:58.140 --> 22:04.060
out with them? Do you tend to write books one at a time? No, I write books one at a time. But the

22:04.060 --> 22:09.940
publishing industry publishes them slowly, which is something that I guess many readers don't realize.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.880
I was in Dubuque from 1976 through 1979.

22:18.300 --> 22:28.720
I began work on Fever Dream, began researching it late 1978. So for the last month or so of 1978,

22:29.080 --> 22:38.080
and for most 1979, I devoted to research on Fever Dream while I was teaching. I actually sat down

22:38.080 --> 22:47.720
and began writing Fever Dream right at the end of 1979, around December or so. And 1980, I moved

22:47.720 --> 22:53.660
to Santa Fe. Actually, it was very, it was like Christmas, 1979. I moved to New Mexico. And my

22:53.660 --> 22:58.300
first year here was essentially just devoted to work on Fever Dream. I finished it late in 1980.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.100
That was when it was sold. And it has been two years into making.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.340
During which period I have gone on and written other books?

23:08.180 --> 23:11.620
The publisher was at Poseidon? Poseidon Press.

23:11.920 --> 23:19.980
How are they related to the other presses? Well, Poseidon Press is essentially a new imprint of

23:19.980 --> 23:27.780
Pocket Books, Simon & Schuster. Although it bears Poseidon Press imprint, it is edited by

23:28.340 --> 23:32.880
Pocket Books editors and distributed through Simon & Schuster sales reps.

23:35.360 --> 23:40.580
Oh, interrelationships of imprints and publishers is perhaps too complicated and not sufficiently

23:40.580 --> 23:47.260
interesting to go into. So the major thing for people seeking to book to know is that Fever Dream

23:47.260 --> 23:53.620
is a Poseidon Press hardcover and distributed through Simon & Schuster can be obtained through them.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.360
Any sequels or prequels for the future?

24:01.440 --> 24:08.080
I've had several people suggest sequels to me. I have no immediate plans for doing any. No,

24:08.220 --> 24:13.980
I think the story finishes when it finishes. But I wouldn't rule them out completely. Obviously,

24:15.160 --> 24:19.320
the type of vampires exist in the book I could do more with if I chose to.

24:19.860 --> 24:26.180
I would think prequels might almost be in order more than sequels in that you could go even earlier.

24:26.360 --> 24:33.360
However, I guess Marsh is out. He would be an interesting case. Maybe you could write the 13

24:33.360 --> 24:42.000
years what he did then if you ever wanted to go back to him. Okay, one final question then,

24:42.000 --> 24:50.720
I guess just more for the in general. This is a more or less in the horror genre if we have to

24:50.720 --> 24:58.220
assign genres to things. Why is that genre thriving? I guess more than thriving now,

24:58.260 --> 25:02.940
but that seems to be the biggest genre, even bigger than romances. Again,

25:04.740 --> 25:08.260
why do people like to get scared at this particular point in history?

25:12.000 --> 25:18.820
That's an interesting question. I'm not sure I have a good answer for it. I could take a stab at it.

25:21.260 --> 25:29.040
I think part of it is simply a literary phenomenon. Stephen King, an enormously talented writer who

25:29.040 --> 25:34.840
has revolutionized and modernized horror and made an extremely viable form once again after

25:34.840 --> 25:41.540
decades in the doldrums. A lot of it is people's response to King has been so enormous that

25:42.000 --> 25:46.560
a lot of imitators have come in. I hope that with FigurDream I've

25:48.300 --> 25:52.200
done a little more than imitation. I tried to bring something new and original to it.

25:52.740 --> 26:00.120
In a deeper psychological sense, beyond simply the literary and commercial success story of King,

26:02.360 --> 26:08.680
I think people may be going to horror because in horror novels we're scared,

26:08.680 --> 26:17.380
but we can control the scares. We can read the book and scare ourselves,

26:18.420 --> 26:23.260
but then we put down the book and we know that what we're afraid of, vampires, werewolves,

26:23.540 --> 26:35.040
haunted hotels, whatever, is not real. People don't mind dealing with that and getting a little

26:35.040 --> 26:42.220
catharsis out of that, but they don't want to deal with the real terrifying things of violence

26:42.220 --> 26:50.780
in the streets and crime and crazed psychos out there and the threat of nuclear holocaust and

26:50.780 --> 26:55.540
all of the other more real fears that also hang over it. I think that may be part of it.

26:57.220 --> 27:01.240
Would you object if somebody came along and said they wanted to make a movie out of FigurDream?

27:01.240 --> 27:04.960
It seems like a good candidate for a movie. Well, I would love to see a movie.

27:05.860 --> 27:10.020
We've had a fair amount of interest from Hollywood, but nothing definite.

27:10.900 --> 27:17.860
Oh, good. I envisioned Sour Billy as just war and oats, just straight war and oats,

27:17.920 --> 27:21.400
especially at the first. Towards the end it was more difficult to imagine it,

27:21.440 --> 27:25.860
but I could just see the whole movie. I don't know who would be Captain Marsh, though.

27:25.860 --> 27:30.800
That would be a hard one to cast. To get somebody to gain a lot of weight.

27:31.480 --> 27:37.660
Well, I could see Ed Asner in it. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, he would be good.

27:39.180 --> 27:43.460
Okay, I have to go back and reread it with that in mind. Do you have any questions, Susan?

27:44.160 --> 27:48.380
Okay, she doesn't want to ask any. George, thanks very much. It was a pleasure.

27:49.980 --> 27:53.880
Thank you. And plus I enjoyed the book really. It was quite good.

27:54.520 --> 27:59.320
Well, I'm glad to hear that, of course. And thanks for doing the interview.

27:59.580 --> 28:02.040
You'll be able to send me a tape like you did on the last one?

28:02.120 --> 28:04.600
Sure. You want a tape of the Raw interview as well?

28:05.860 --> 28:07.580
I'm not the tape of the finished product.

28:07.800 --> 28:11.180
Yeah, we'll send you a tape of the finished product. I'll probably write it up pretty quick,

28:11.560 --> 28:14.720
and we'll get a few shows out of it, and we'll send it on to you. Yeah.

28:14.840 --> 28:19.960
When you send that to me, could you also like to go to the list of the stations we'll be

28:19.960 --> 28:23.760
broadcast, because I know the public relations people at Simon Schuster would like to know that.

28:23.760 --> 28:27.300
Sure. Be glad to. Okay. No problem. George, thanks again.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.880
Keep on writing. Look forward to seeing what's coming out next.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.180
Sounds good. I'll see you at Texas Con.

28:32.380 --> 28:33.400
Great. Bye-bye now.
