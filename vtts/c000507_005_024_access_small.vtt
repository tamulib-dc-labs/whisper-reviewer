00:08.540 --> 00:13.720
Welcome to the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on Science Fiction today.

00:14.540 --> 00:17.520
A presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.740
And now your hosts.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.400
This is Daryl Lane. Keith Johnson.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.360
And David Carson in this show will be on Time Travel.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.720
Using anybody's life there's always been a time when you wish you could have gone back

01:26.720 --> 01:31.720
and done something different. Yes, most science fiction authors would admit,

01:32.220 --> 01:36.520
for instance Larry Niven himself does, who's written articles on time travel, that it is

01:36.520 --> 01:41.760
impossible and any author who uses the theme or the environment of time travel for a story

01:41.760 --> 01:48.340
is simply plain, engaging in wish fulfillment or writing the classic what if science fiction

01:48.340 --> 01:51.720
stories since time travel obviously seems to be impossible.

01:52.060 --> 01:59.280
But recently there have been authors who have, or scientists I should say who have written

01:59.280 --> 02:04.020
on the subject and developed some fairly interesting ideas.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.960
I think first of all what I would recognize about time is that it's not a fixed thing.

02:10.540 --> 02:14.420
If we wanted to this evening we could walk out and look into the past.

02:14.980 --> 02:18.600
Simply by looking at the stars we're looking millions of years into the past.

02:21.180 --> 02:26.440
So it's not a fixed thing. It's something which you can play with with some scientific

02:26.440 --> 02:34.880
justification. Einstein's theory of relativity I believe indicates that as velocity increases,

02:35.500 --> 02:39.320
time goes more slowly. Of course that's only a one way trip.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.860
You can take a trip into the future merely by putting yourself in a rocket ship that

02:43.860 --> 02:46.380
can travel at a sizable fraction of the speed of light.

02:46.760 --> 02:52.720
When you come back to the earth, the earth will have aged perhaps a million years and

02:52.720 --> 02:56.160
you are only five minutes older if your rocket ship will go that fast.

02:56.460 --> 03:00.060
But you can't go back into the past. You are stuck with that earth which will be somewhat

03:00.060 --> 03:00.360
unfamiliar.

03:01.060 --> 03:04.400
Well you're not manipulating time, no in that sense. You're not really traveling in it.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.820
Haven't there been experiments where they've proven, say putting clocks on airplanes and

03:10.820 --> 03:14.100
leaving some fixed where time, I mean it can be shown this is a fact.

03:14.380 --> 03:14.480
Yes.

03:14.740 --> 03:16.040
Time can be slowed down.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.740
Yes they really have. Take two atomic clocks, put one on an airplane which flies around

03:21.740 --> 03:25.680
the world and when the second clock gets back and is compared with the first clock it's

03:25.680 --> 03:28.640
lost a microsecond, a millionth of a second.

03:29.040 --> 03:33.260
Now you can't do too much with that but if you multiply that by a large fraction, a large

03:33.260 --> 03:37.920
number, then you can build a pretty good science fiction story around it and many authors have.

03:38.600 --> 03:48.060
With that beginning, with that basis in Einstein's theory of relativity, why can't we perceive

03:48.060 --> 03:53.080
as Dr. Robert Forward has done in his article, How to Build a Time Machine, why can't we

03:53.080 --> 04:01.840
conceive or imagine of a, say using a black hole which supposedly is so dense, so collapsing

04:01.840 --> 04:06.840
at such a tremendous rate of speed that time is distorted.

04:07.580 --> 04:11.900
Yes, Einstein for example, views the universe as a fabric not only of space but of space

04:11.900 --> 04:17.820
plus time so that if you can somehow distort that you can perhaps bend the universe so

04:17.820 --> 04:21.560
to speak enough so that you could travel in time and one way of bending the universe is

04:21.560 --> 04:25.580
with a tremendous gravitational field. In fact that's what Einstein says gravity is.

04:25.900 --> 04:30.460
So in the vicinity of a black hole time and space are so distorted you should be able

04:30.460 --> 04:35.160
to according to our current equations be able to go forward or backward in time simply by

04:35.160 --> 04:39.780
going around a black hole or some kind of condensed heavy object like that in a suitable

04:39.780 --> 04:43.860
direction at a suitable rate of speed. Now these are only equations, the theory says

04:43.860 --> 04:48.660
that this might be the case and it still has to be confirmed. It hasn't, that part of relativity

04:48.660 --> 04:51.040
has not been confirmed the way some of the other things have.

04:51.520 --> 04:57.900
But doesn't current physics theory allow for instance for the creation of say miniature

04:57.900 --> 05:03.320
supernova, miniature black hole say with particle bombardment. Aren't some of the velocities

05:03.320 --> 05:09.120
reached by particles sufficient to in theory create a supernova, a miniature black hole

05:09.120 --> 05:12.680
which can be used for time alteration?

05:12.820 --> 05:17.300
Not at present. We don't see a way of creating a miniature black hole. However some people

05:17.300 --> 05:22.400
have thought that in the original Big Bang, the tremendous explosion that according to

05:22.400 --> 05:25.720
current theory created the universe, there might have been some miniature black holes

05:25.720 --> 05:30.720
that were created and we would not have detected them because after all they are black and

05:30.720 --> 05:34.380
in the blackness of outer space you wouldn't be able to see them and these might be utilized

05:34.380 --> 05:36.140
eventually to travel in time.

05:37.260 --> 05:43.360
Let's put it this way in theory. If there are such things as black holes, Dr. Forward

05:43.360 --> 05:50.240
writes that if we were able to, assuming a black hole is a collapsing star, a giant star

05:50.240 --> 05:56.200
is collapsing, it has a velocity, it has a spin, perhaps with an elliptical shape to

05:56.200 --> 06:02.300
it bulging at the equator. He writes that if we could somehow, if we had the technology,

06:02.360 --> 06:09.360
if we had the engineering to induce that bulge to reshape itself into a donut shape, the

06:09.360 --> 06:14.020
middle of the black hole would then become sort of a time gate. If one entered it one

06:14.020 --> 06:16.040
would be traveling through time.

06:16.040 --> 06:20.300
The problem with a normal black hole, just a spherical collapsed object is that when

06:20.300 --> 06:25.600
you go into it, you usually cannot get out and terrible things happen to you at the middle.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.940
We don't even know what but we know that it would be pretty drastic. But if you could

06:28.940 --> 06:32.920
spin a black hole very rapidly, it would spin out into a donut and the center of it would

06:32.920 --> 06:39.180
be accessible and presumably, possibly, you wouldn't pull yourself apart into your constituent

06:39.180 --> 06:43.960
atoms when you go through the center. I don't know how we could do it. Forward seems to

06:43.960 --> 06:47.960
think that with current technology, we could create a black hole donut. I think we're

06:47.960 --> 06:49.200
quite a ways away from that yet.

06:49.660 --> 06:54.480
But he does write at the end of his article, he does admit, he says, okay, the manipulation

06:54.480 --> 06:59.380
of a black hole or the time traveling itself with people involved, he says that's probably

06:59.380 --> 07:04.680
thousands of years away. But he does write that perhaps within a hundred years, we would

07:04.680 --> 07:12.380
have the technology to send information back in time, say, using creating miniature black

07:12.380 --> 07:14.960
holes with particle bombardments.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.020
Or even using miniature black holes that we happen to stumble across in our exploration

07:19.020 --> 07:19.840
of the solar system.

07:20.060 --> 07:23.540
But he seems to think that within a hundred years, we can send information, not people,

07:23.700 --> 07:26.480
back into the past, which of course could be used to change the past.

07:26.820 --> 07:30.540
It's a lot easier to send, say, a gamma ray back into the past than it would be a gross

07:30.540 --> 07:31.080
human being.

07:40.780 --> 07:48.620
Time travel is one of the most recent themes used in science fiction.

07:49.760 --> 07:55.680
I think the reason for that is that the ancient, say, the classical world, and some people,

07:55.760 --> 07:58.520
by the way, take science fiction themes all the way back to the Greek and Roman days.

07:58.520 --> 08:04.320
But I don't think they can do that with time travel because the concept of time in the

08:04.320 --> 08:09.660
classical world, say, with the Greeks and Romans in the BC era, was totally different

08:09.660 --> 08:15.880
from the one that we have today. They didn't conceive of time as a progression, as a series

08:15.880 --> 08:23.300
of causes and effects. For instance, the future. To a classical Greek, the future was going

08:23.300 --> 08:29.000
to be just about like the present. The idea of evolution was not part of their worldview.

08:29.300 --> 08:36.840
The future would be the same as the present. The past was also different to them. Today,

08:37.120 --> 08:43.340
if a science fiction author or a creative writer wanted to reproduce something or write

08:43.340 --> 08:50.900
about the past, he may take his hero back into the past, a traveling process. That would

08:50.900 --> 08:54.140
not be alien to the Greeks. All they would have to do if they wanted to see somebody

08:54.140 --> 08:58.700
from the past is to say, travel to Hades, as Homer had some of his heroes do. If they

08:58.700 --> 09:03.080
wanted to meet somebody who was dead or go over past events, they would simply meet the

09:03.080 --> 09:08.420
person involved by going to Hades. This is where he would be. His abode. But in the sense

09:08.420 --> 09:15.640
of something gone, finished, done, irretrievable, their concept of time would not allow for

09:15.640 --> 09:18.940
that. So the time travel story was not something that they would use.

09:33.220 --> 09:38.820
From the time when a concept of time as a continuing progression, up until the time

09:38.820 --> 09:45.120
that science fiction began to catch on, people did use the concept of time travel in certain

09:45.120 --> 09:52.460
ways, but not as an exploration of the time travel, as per se, by itself. But they only

09:52.460 --> 09:57.420
used it as a means to put their protagonist into some particular situation or to explore

09:57.420 --> 10:02.160
a particular theme. One of the earliest of these was Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol,

10:02.640 --> 10:08.040
in which Scrooge was taken back to his past and shown scenes of his early childhood, and

10:08.040 --> 10:13.160
then taken into his far future and shown scenes of what the future would be like after he

10:13.160 --> 10:18.220
had died, to show the contrast between these two and to show him where he was headed if

10:18.220 --> 10:24.860
he continued on his current path. That same sort of thing was extrapolated on by Mark

10:24.860 --> 10:31.620
Twain in the Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Court, where a young man working in a factory

10:31.620 --> 10:38.880
was struck over the head, and when he woke up, he was in ancient England under the reign

10:38.880 --> 10:47.520
of King Arthur, and then he brought 19th century technology into the 14th century and in various

10:47.520 --> 10:51.980
ways brought havoc in King Arthur's kingdom.

10:52.820 --> 10:56.540
Wasn't there the possibility in that book that he was only dreaming that? Didn't he

10:56.540 --> 10:58.860
sort of wake up and enter back into the present?

10:59.280 --> 11:03.000
That's true. It's a wish fulfillment type story.

11:03.420 --> 11:09.700
So in essence, you can't really say that it was time travel. The method is unimportant.

11:09.840 --> 11:15.440
As Keith said, it was simply the going back, whether it was a dream or a vision or however.

11:16.200 --> 11:23.980
I think in many cases an author might come up with the idea, what if I had a 19th century

11:23.980 --> 11:30.400
man in 14th century England and he had all this advanced technological expertise, what

11:30.400 --> 11:37.100
would he do, what would it be like, and of course Mark Twain's character went about and

11:37.100 --> 11:42.020
he invented the telephone and steam engines and electrical generators, and at the end of

11:42.020 --> 11:48.620
the story he was fighting a terrific battle with Merlin using all sorts of electric fences

11:48.620 --> 11:55.200
and fireworks and magnetic devices to hold the knights in armor rooted to the spot.

11:55.200 --> 12:02.020
Of course, Twain being Twain, he developed a great deal of humor or satire cleverness

12:02.020 --> 12:07.080
in this story. It was mostly a humorous novel. It's the reason he wrote it. Of course, that

12:07.080 --> 12:13.020
was Twain's method. But probably I think most science fiction commentators, in fact I would

12:13.020 --> 12:18.500
say all of them are almost unanimous in agreeing that the first modern time travel story was

12:18.500 --> 12:23.380
H. G. Wells, The Time Machine, published in 1895.

12:23.970 --> 12:32.060
That's the first time travel story in which the protagonist uses a device in order to travel through time.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.040
You'd probably say that story would have a social purpose to it.

12:37.280 --> 12:46.580
Yes, as Wells wrote it, he was sort of a commentary on Victorian England of his time. He was contrasting

12:46.580 --> 12:55.420
the upper class with the newly developing middle class and working class citizens as

12:55.420 --> 13:03.280
the Morlocks in the book who were the sort of troglodytes lived underground, worked with

13:03.280 --> 13:08.840
machinery all the time, and the Eloi who lived above ground were what we would call, I guess,

13:08.960 --> 13:09.760
the beautiful people.

13:14.220 --> 13:19.060
We might note also that even though Wells was the first one to really use a machine

13:19.580 --> 13:24.480
for the passage through time, there was no method to the machine. I mean, there was

13:24.480 --> 13:26.880
no physics, no mechanics, no theory behind it.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.540
No, just flashing lights and dials and numbers.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.320
It looked good. It sounded good.

13:30.380 --> 13:31.620
Yes, it looked good in the movie too.

13:32.060 --> 13:32.260
Right.

13:33.460 --> 13:37.300
Yes, a lot of the social commentary was lost in the movie.

13:38.540 --> 13:43.880
Then, of course, I would say that probably some of the best known modern science fiction

13:43.880 --> 13:49.360
novels of the time travel would carry forward the serious purpose that Wells had in his

13:49.360 --> 13:51.060
story, the time machine.

13:51.320 --> 13:58.340
Many modern books would have a social message or a reason for using the time travel motif.

13:59.220 --> 14:02.900
Such a book like that might be Pavane by Keith Roberts.

14:03.590 --> 14:12.760
That book was a, what if the Spanish Armada had won that naval engagement in England had

14:12.760 --> 14:18.720
been different than what it is now, and the Catholic Church came in and suppressed technology.

14:19.600 --> 14:26.280
Its time frame is our present, but their methods of communication and locomotion are

14:26.280 --> 14:28.020
extremely archaic compared to ours.

14:28.470 --> 14:35.660
They communicate over long distance using huge towers that use a semaphore, flags and

14:36.410 --> 14:43.780
gates for communication, and they travel our hull heavy loads over long distances using

14:43.780 --> 14:46.600
an antiquated version of steam engine.

14:47.560 --> 14:54.160
Occasionally, one runs into a story in which time travel, per se, is central to the novel.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.080
It is the central feature that is being explored.

14:57.640 --> 15:03.360
One of the most complex and enjoyable of these was written by the incredibly prolific author,

15:03.540 --> 15:07.400
Isaac Asimov, back in the mid-50s called The End of Eternity.

15:08.240 --> 15:15.520
In this novel, Asimov sets up in a core of time travelers who are trying to improve the

15:15.520 --> 15:20.460
earth. They can travel through centuries. They can drop into any particular century,

15:21.300 --> 15:25.880
institute some kind of change, come back out into their little protected universe, which

15:25.880 --> 15:30.340
is separate from the main time stream, and see what happens. If it is a favorable change,

15:30.540 --> 15:33.680
according to their lights, then they leave it in. If not, they can go back and change

15:33.680 --> 15:33.860
it.

15:34.900 --> 15:41.020
But it turns out in the novel that society has become stagnant because of this. History

15:41.020 --> 15:46.360
is no longer a dynamic process when you can look at the whole thing. Asimov has his novel

15:46.360 --> 15:53.580
ending optimistically when his hero manages to destroy the entire alternate time stream

15:53.580 --> 16:00.060
and makes time travel impossible. But it is an interesting way of treating time travel

16:00.060 --> 16:02.520
and introduces several new concepts on that theme.

16:15.160 --> 16:20.680
Almost any time travel story has to be based on causation. As in Povane, the man in the

16:20.680 --> 16:25.820
high castle, the end of eternity. Alterations are made in time, either in the future or

16:25.820 --> 16:32.500
in the past. Something is removed, some cause which changes in effect. I would say that

16:32.500 --> 16:40.040
any time travel story has to be based on causation. And some novels are very emphatic

16:40.750 --> 16:48.100
in developing that idea. For example, Sprague de Campes, a very well known book, Less Darkness

16:48.100 --> 16:56.480
Fall, deals with a situation in which the protagonist is somehow transported back to

16:56.480 --> 17:01.320
ancient Rome. I think he was struck by a bolt of lightning. The method wasn't so important.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.820
He was thinking about Rome for some reason. He was struck by lightning, he got transported

17:05.820 --> 17:11.100
back to ancient Rome. He happened to be an archeologist, he happened to be knowledgeable

17:11.100 --> 17:18.560
about the classical world. And he knew his history well. And he got the idea of making

17:19.180 --> 17:26.740
very small changes back in ancient Rome in the days of its fall with the idea of preserving

17:26.740 --> 17:33.300
civilization. In history, after the fall of Rome, we have what's called the Dark Ages.

17:34.340 --> 17:41.040
The loss of knowledge, the beginning of barbarism, say a thousand years of darkness, knowledge

17:41.040 --> 17:49.500
was lost. He initiates very small changes which ensure the retention of knowledge, the

17:49.500 --> 17:53.760
small things he keeps alive that will someday again lead to civilization.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.400
How can he be sure that this is in fact what will happen?

17:57.240 --> 18:02.860
Well he doesn't know for sure. All he can do is perform certain actions with his knowledge

18:02.860 --> 18:08.860
of history, what had happened in the future. And what we assume that the changes he makes

18:09.440 --> 18:15.500
have caused our world to be what it is today. Because of what he did, we are the way we

18:15.500 --> 18:17.020
are. We have civilization again.

18:18.200 --> 18:22.580
So he believes that you make small changes in the past and that can radically change the

18:22.580 --> 18:28.160
future. A lot of authors have pursued this theme. One of the best is a short story by

18:28.160 --> 18:34.200
Ray Bradbury called A Sound of Thunder. In this novel or in this short story, Bradbury

18:34.200 --> 18:40.980
takes a group of dinosaur hunters back and they are allowed to kill a dinosaur, cut off

18:40.980 --> 18:45.780
its head, bring it forward into the future, back into their present. But to avoid making

18:45.780 --> 18:50.620
any changes that are significant, the only dinosaurs that the hunters are allowed to

18:50.620 --> 18:54.940
kill are ones that are going to die in a couple of minutes anyway. Scouts have gone back earlier

18:54.940 --> 18:59.780
and checked out which dinosaurs are going to be hit over the head with falling trees

18:59.780 --> 19:06.960
or die of old age or something like that. And they have a path that they must stay on,

19:07.040 --> 19:12.240
some kind of force field path. In the novel, one of the hunters goes back, steps off the

19:12.240 --> 19:16.620
path in a moment of panic and crushes a small butterfly. It's the only change he makes.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.420
But when he comes back, the entire future has been changed. A different president has

19:20.420 --> 19:28.260
been elected. The society has become much more violent and much more oppressive. And

19:28.880 --> 19:34.000
things have changed completely. Not everybody agrees that this is what's the kind of thing

19:34.000 --> 19:36.340
that would happen, but it's an interesting thing to pursue.

19:36.940 --> 19:41.480
I thought the causation in that story was fascinating because instead of taking what

19:41.480 --> 19:44.540
you would assume to be something huge, a big cause, you know, something, you know, like

19:44.540 --> 19:50.440
assassinating a Napoleon or keeping a Lincoln from being assassinated or something. Brad

19:50.440 --> 19:58.640
Ray takes something so small, you know, simply the crushing of one butterfly and shows that

19:58.640 --> 20:03.000
such a trivial event can cause the entire future to be changed.

20:50.240 --> 20:56.260
Another interesting facet of time travel stories is Paradox. And one of the favorite paradoxes

20:56.260 --> 21:00.680
is the grandfather paradox. Let's say your grandfather invented a time machine, but

21:00.680 --> 21:05.420
you hate your grandfather, so you steal his time machine and travel back 60 years and

21:05.420 --> 21:10.580
kill him. But you killed him before he met your grandmother. So therefore you weren't

21:10.580 --> 21:16.220
born, so you couldn't kill your grandfather. And you couldn't have traveled back in time.

21:16.580 --> 21:20.820
A paradox, that's right. A lot of science fiction authors play around with that one.

21:22.200 --> 21:26.440
If you were able to go back into the past, what if you met yourself? Or what if you did

21:26.440 --> 21:30.060
something to yourself back in the past or one of your ancestors that would prevent your

21:30.060 --> 21:39.580
being in the present? I think another paradox, too, would involve the future. If you could

21:39.580 --> 21:47.940
travel into the future and if you could come back, how could you remember what you have

21:47.940 --> 21:53.220
done or how could you bring anything back? The future has not yet occurred. And if you

21:53.220 --> 21:58.020
brought back some information, then you would be changing the present from what it had been.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.800
And this I think is the core of many of these paradoxes.

22:01.780 --> 22:08.200
Larry Niven and his essays has come up with several interesting ideas on time travel. One

22:08.200 --> 22:13.460
of them being that no matter what a time traveler does in the past, he can't change the future.

22:14.980 --> 22:21.440
If he goes back and saved Lincoln from being assassinated, then President Lincoln might

22:21.440 --> 22:25.600
slip and fall down the stairs in the Ford Theater when leaving the theater that night

22:26.190 --> 22:30.460
and die as a result of that accident. That's called the conservation of events.

22:30.900 --> 22:35.540
A number of authors have treated this idea. The time stream has a certain amount of inertia

22:35.540 --> 22:40.620
and it takes a lot of effort to make even small changes in it. Fritz Lieber wrote a

22:40.620 --> 22:44.580
story, I believe it was Lieber, in which he is trying to prevent a certain person from

22:44.580 --> 22:49.520
being killed by being shot in the head. And he goes back and he changes the past repeatedly

22:50.060 --> 22:54.460
and something happens to cancel his changes. Finally, he goes back and makes one big change,

22:54.540 --> 22:59.300
making it impossible for anyone to shoot this particular person. And a small meteorite comes

22:59.300 --> 23:02.800
down from outer space and goes through his head, accomplishing exactly the same event.

23:20.660 --> 23:27.820
James B. Hogan, a recent addition to the ranks of science fiction authors, has written

23:27.820 --> 23:35.040
several novels steeply based in science fact. Among those being the Genesis Machine, Inherit

23:35.040 --> 23:41.240
the Stars, the General Giants of Ganymede, Two Faces of Tomorrow, and the novel which

23:41.240 --> 23:43.860
we will now look at, Thrice Upon a Time.

23:46.540 --> 23:52.200
Thrice Upon a Time is Hogan's latest book, his fifth novel. The setting is the Highlands

23:52.200 --> 23:59.260
of Scotland in the year 2009, 2010. And we first meet Sir Charles Ross, who is a genius

23:59.260 --> 24:06.300
in theoretical physics. He's won a Nobel Prize years before and he now works alone in his

24:06.300 --> 24:12.360
ancestral castle. And he's pursuing a phenomenon he discovered years before. While experimenting

24:12.360 --> 24:18.500
with the conversion of mass into energy, bombarding electrons with sufficient force to annihilate

24:18.500 --> 24:26.600
them. Physics theory says that the energy liberated by the annihilation of mass should be equal

24:27.280 --> 24:34.400
to the mass being annihilated. But in Sir Charles' experiments it's not. He finally finds out

24:34.400 --> 24:39.540
that a small amount of energy, the inequality comes about because a small amount of energy

24:39.540 --> 24:46.180
is lost. And he finally figures out where it's gone. It's gone into the past. And he's

24:46.180 --> 24:52.160
now learned to control that lost energy and send information into the past. He sends this

24:52.160 --> 24:56.080
information to himself and receives it on the machine that he's rigged up for that purpose.

24:57.500 --> 25:01.780
As the novel gets moving, Sir Charles sends for his grandson Murdoch, who's a bright young

25:01.780 --> 25:07.380
man working in the United States. And he wants Murdoch to help him with his research. Murdoch

25:07.380 --> 25:13.200
arrives, begins to aid his grandfather in his time research, and meets Anne in a nearby

25:13.200 --> 25:19.300
village and falls in love with her. Complications obviously need to arise and they do very quickly.

25:20.260 --> 25:26.980
Two potential catastrophes develop. Both catastrophes sufficient to wipe out life on the earth. This

25:26.980 --> 25:31.300
may sound like a big coincidence that such huge things could happen in the space of a

25:31.300 --> 25:36.140
few pages, but the book is so realistic we don't really question them. But for each potential

25:36.140 --> 25:42.580
catastrophe Murdoch alters the past with his grandfather's machine. Avert's disaster,

25:42.580 --> 25:49.000
but he also changes the present when he does so. The first catastrophe involves a dysfunctional

25:49.000 --> 25:54.860
fusion reactor. The reactor accelerates particles to such speeds that they become miniature supernovas.

25:55.560 --> 25:59.980
Then miniature black holes. And even though they're miniature, they're deadly. They zing

25:59.980 --> 26:05.060
around the earth and punch holes in people and objects. Murdoch sends a warning into

26:05.060 --> 26:10.860
the past on his grandfather's machine. This allows the reactor people to correct the flaw

26:11.600 --> 26:17.040
and everything seems to be okay except in the new timeline, the new present, the altered

26:17.040 --> 26:21.640
present which comes about because of Murdoch's tampering with the past. He doesn't meet Anne.

26:23.340 --> 26:27.620
The second potential disaster comes from a plague which is beginning because of a deadly

26:27.620 --> 26:34.500
virus spread by mistake from a biological research satellite. An antidote fails because of another

26:34.500 --> 26:40.960
mistake. Murdoch again sends information back into the past which removes the mistake causing

26:40.960 --> 26:48.080
the bad antidote and once again the world is saved. So a new timeline is set up, a new present,

26:48.460 --> 26:53.540
the third since the novel began. This must be where the title comes from, Thrice Upon a Time.

26:54.520 --> 27:00.400
In this altered present, it seems as if Murdoch and Anne will meet and become close again because

27:00.400 --> 27:05.900
of the help of a kitten named Maxwell. So the book ends on a positive note, both in the personal

27:05.900 --> 27:11.440
life of Murdoch and Anne and on the, well, the more universal plane where these catastrophes have

27:11.440 --> 27:16.880
been averted. My reactions to the book are very positive. I have a great liking for Hogan's,

27:16.880 --> 27:22.960
all of his fiction. If his first five novels are any indication of what he'll do in the future,

27:23.080 --> 27:28.960
I think he'll be one of the greatest names in the field by the time he's done. The novel illustrates

27:28.960 --> 27:34.520
his strongest point, I think, and that's realism. The book is grounded in hard science and present

27:34.520 --> 27:40.360
physics theory to the point where everything seems possible. You ask, why isn't this being

27:40.360 --> 27:44.240
done right now? Why isn't somebody sending information into the past? It's so plausible,

27:44.440 --> 27:51.400
so meticulously worked out. It seems to me that maybe either he read Forward's article that we

27:51.400 --> 27:57.940
refer to earlier or Forward has read Hogan's book because Hogan is writing about the sending of

27:57.940 --> 28:04.300
information into the past, small bits of information into the recent past, which is what Forward said

28:04.300 --> 28:08.820
at the end of his article, we would have the technology to perform within 100 years. This book,

28:08.880 --> 28:15.180
I think, occurs about maybe 40 years into the future. My only criticism is that it does start

28:15.180 --> 28:23.740
slowly. There's a lot of science at the beginning of the book. The characters engage in dialogue

28:23.740 --> 28:29.200
that makes them sound like professors lecturing at a symposium about theories of physics and so

28:29.200 --> 28:35.160
forth. But it does pick up. The action accelerates, the romantic plot helps, and the reader finds it

28:35.160 --> 28:39.100
difficult to put the book down because he's interested in seeing what will happen and how it

28:39.100 --> 28:44.540
will happen. Overall, I think he's done a very impressive job of making time travel believable.

29:00.360 --> 29:09.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

29:09.860 --> 29:15.080
Association, in conjunction with Odessa College and KOCV FM.
