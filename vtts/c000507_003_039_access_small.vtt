Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.540 --> 00:33.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.580 --> 00:38.220
And here are your hosts.

00:42.540 --> 00:43.640
This is Daryl Lane.

00:43.900 --> 00:44.560
And David Carson.

00:44.980 --> 00:48.000
Few individuals have had the impact on science fiction that Damon Knight has.

00:48.600 --> 00:52.040
He's written quality short stories and novels, of course, since his first published work

00:52.040 --> 00:53.700
over 40 years ago in 1941.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.960
But he's done so much else for the field.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.600
He's recognized as the first and perhaps still the best critic of science fiction.

01:00.100 --> 01:03.900
He founded the Science Fiction Writers of America, and he initiated the Milford Science

01:03.900 --> 01:06.200
Fiction Writers Conference for authors of science fiction.

01:06.740 --> 01:10.720
He's also one of the premier editors in science fiction, having constructed enough anthologies

01:10.720 --> 01:11.540
to fill a library.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.960
We spoke with Knight recently and asked him how he got a start in science fiction.

01:15.420 --> 01:18.400
I thought that might come up, and I was rooting about it really yesterday.

01:21.600 --> 01:27.080
Actually, I was thinking, what if you asked me what do I attribute my gigantic success

01:27.080 --> 01:28.540
that would have to say mostly luck?

01:29.480 --> 01:35.660
I can trace my career back through a series of just astounding coincidences, really unlikely

01:35.660 --> 01:38.740
things, all the way back to Hulu Gernsback.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.740
And I can demonstrate that at each of these points, if something rather unlikely had not

01:43.740 --> 01:45.320
happened, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.820
For instance, if Hulu Gernsback had not come to this country from Luxembourg when he was

01:50.820 --> 01:59.260
14 and started a magazine called Amazing Stories in 1926, you'll see as I go on that

01:59.260 --> 02:00.420
none of the other things could have happened.

02:00.620 --> 02:06.160
So here I am, a 13-year-old kid in a literary and reading science fiction magazine, really

02:06.160 --> 02:07.860
turned on the item.

02:08.060 --> 02:14.660
And through the back pages of one of these magazines, Super Science Stories, then edited

02:14.660 --> 02:21.660
by Frederick Polk, I found out about fanzines and wrote away for a few, and this boy got

02:21.660 --> 02:23.200
into correspondence with the Futurians.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.520
The Futurians were a group of young science fiction fans who later became some of the

02:27.520 --> 02:29.120
major writers and editors in the field.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.060
At the time, they included Frederick Polk, Donal A. Walheim, Cyril Cornbluth, and Robert

02:34.060 --> 02:34.940
W. Lowndes.

02:35.380 --> 02:40.100
I was trying to write some stories, and I sent a couple to Lowndes who was then acting

02:40.100 --> 02:41.740
as a thorough half-assed literary agent.

02:43.800 --> 02:51.280
And all these things added up together until Donal A. Walheim got an offer from a publisher

02:51.280 --> 02:53.040
who edited a new science fiction magazine.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.980
He had no budget for whatever, for stories.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.700
And he knew about me from Lowndes.

02:57.820 --> 03:02.340
Lowndes wrote to me saying, will you donate the story to the first issue of Super Science

03:02.340 --> 03:02.940
Stories?

03:04.300 --> 03:07.040
And of course I said yes, I would have paid for the privilege.

03:08.380 --> 03:14.820
And as a consequence of that, the Futurians invited me to come and be a Futurian, live

03:14.820 --> 03:17.180
one of their communal dwellings in New York when I was 18.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.060
Terribly unlikely things.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.780
Just a series of them, even as far as I've gone.

03:24.160 --> 03:28.820
And I was there a couple years doing a little illustration from magazines and trying to write,

03:29.560 --> 03:31.080
and not particularly very much.

03:32.720 --> 03:41.420
And then in 1943, again, this Fred Poole got me a job at popular publications where he was working.

03:41.660 --> 03:45.680
I needed an assistant editor, and he knew I would work cheap.

03:46.020 --> 03:48.200
So he got me an interview, and I got the job.

03:48.640 --> 03:53.340
I spent about a year there, and I'm perfectly convinced now, looking back, that it was that

03:53.340 --> 03:57.220
training at popular publications that enabled me to write fiction professionally.

03:58.340 --> 04:01.960
It was a training that you couldn't get in any school, and I doubt if you could get it now.

04:02.740 --> 04:07.100
But it just kind of soaked in, because I was reading this watch pile, the Unpoliced

04:07.100 --> 04:12.060
Good Banscript, and it became perfectly obvious after a while what the difference was between

04:12.060 --> 04:14.340
the stuff we were rejecting and the stuff we were printing.

04:15.660 --> 04:17.560
So when I quit that job, I started writing.

04:26.680 --> 04:30.700
Night began publishing science fiction stories, many of which have become classics today,

04:31.120 --> 04:35.280
but he also continued his editing and considers such work as the ideal training ground for young

04:35.280 --> 04:36.160
science fiction writers.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.560
More with Damon Knight next time.

05:40.560 --> 05:47.540
Thanks for watching.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.720
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

06:17.660 --> 06:22.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.080
And here are your hosts.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.300
This is Daryl Lane.

06:32.540 --> 06:33.160
And David Carson.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.560
Damon Knight's apprenticeship to science fiction came as a member of the Futurians, a group

06:37.560 --> 06:41.640
of fans in the 1930s who later became some of the principal editors and writers in the field.

06:41.640 --> 06:45.400
Knight has written a book about the Futurians, published in 1977.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.220
He reminisces about the group.

06:47.960 --> 06:55.860
Well, the Futurians were a very informal organization of science fiction fans who were trying to become

06:55.860 --> 07:01.520
professionals, and in some cases had had little bits of success here and there in the published

07:01.520 --> 07:01.900
stories.

07:03.140 --> 07:07.820
And I told you that Walheim was editing a magazine before him, who had become an editor.

07:08.380 --> 07:11.000
And after him, Lowndes also became an editor.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.500
And they were writing and publishing a little bit, not much.

07:15.360 --> 07:20.200
And to save money because they were all very poor, they lived in a county old apartment.

07:22.220 --> 07:27.120
At that time in New York in the late 30s and early 40s, there were lots of apartments from

07:27.120 --> 07:27.960
where they were very cheap.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.400
I forget now.

07:30.500 --> 07:35.800
I think the rental might have been about $30 bucks for a four bedroom railroad flat.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.640
If you had four people living there, it was quite cheap.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.080
And we divided up the household duties.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.000
Round with the cooking and I did the fish washing, which I hated.

07:47.760 --> 07:48.900
We were dirt poor.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.500
We really didn't have any money at all.

07:51.440 --> 07:57.520
We rolled our own cigarettes and we bought the cheapest wine we could find, which was

07:57.520 --> 07:59.140
something like 85 cents a gallon.

08:02.540 --> 08:08.140
Our major entertainment was walking down from the 102nd Street or 103rd, if I was

08:08.140 --> 08:12.580
bound, to Times Square and looking at the bright lights and having a cup of coffee in

08:12.580 --> 08:14.520
the cafeteria and then walking home.

08:36.880 --> 08:41.240
Before Knight became recognized as an author of science fiction, he worked on fanzines,

08:41.440 --> 08:43.000
as an editor, and as a book reviewer.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.880
Out of his experiences as a book reviewer, Knight developed some critical principles that he

08:46.880 --> 08:47.920
applied to science fiction.

08:48.340 --> 08:51.880
And he actually became the first and probably still the best critic of the field.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.220
Knight talks about that period of his development in the 1940s when he began writing criticism.

08:57.200 --> 09:01.100
I was trying to write fiction at that time and not succeeding.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.160
I couldn't finish the story.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.520
I didn't have any idea how you got to the end of the story.

09:06.760 --> 09:12.600
But I was extremely critical and starting like any other, right, 17 or 18 year old fan.

09:15.560 --> 09:19.420
The first stuff I did for fanzines was not critical in the usual sense.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.240
I mean, it wasn't book reviews or what kind of thing.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.080
But it was parody mostly.

09:25.160 --> 09:32.700
The things that I thought were really outstandingly dumb in the magazine, funny enough to parody.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.820
I did a lot of that.

09:36.200 --> 09:42.860
But when I say a lot, I lie because I only published two issues of my fanzine and did very little

09:42.860 --> 09:43.960
for other magazines.

09:43.960 --> 09:50.820
It was much later, about 1945, I think, that I did a long critical essay about that.

09:50.940 --> 09:53.920
Those were one of Larry Shaw's amateur magazines.

09:54.820 --> 09:59.320
That was really the first critical work in the usual sense, correct?

10:00.620 --> 10:05.160
Knight's criticism in book reviews were published in 1967 as a book entitled In Search of Wonder,

10:05.420 --> 10:07.480
a landmark since it was the first book of its kind.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.980
What Knight basically tried to do in his criticism was raise science fiction writing to a higher level,

10:11.980 --> 10:15.800
to establish standards for it that would make it the equal of mainstream literature and quality.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.440
On our next show, we'll continue our conversation with Damon Knight.

11:47.480 --> 11:51.540
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

12:07.320 --> 12:11.960
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and the science fiction

12:11.960 --> 12:12.480
and fantasy.

12:15.740 --> 12:16.820
And here are your hosts.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.180
This is Daryl Lane.

12:22.380 --> 12:23.020
And David Carson.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.860
Damon Knight's influence on science fiction is indisputable, and it's made itself felt in many different ways.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.920
Knight was the originator of the science fiction writers of America, for example, back in 1965.

12:33.540 --> 12:35.280
We asked him how the organization came about.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.560
About ten years earlier, it must have been.

12:39.880 --> 12:44.900
There was an effort to form a guild of science fiction writers, and I went to one or two of their meetings,

12:46.020 --> 12:51.920
and it was pitiful because they used the program in their procedure, and they had 50 people all arguing.

12:52.860 --> 12:59.700
And they finally hammered out a sort of set of bylaws and elected officers, and then nothing happened.

13:00.060 --> 13:01.720
Officers all went home and just died.

13:02.820 --> 13:06.900
And I realized at that time that there was a very easy way to do it.

13:06.960 --> 13:11.120
You didn't have to have the big meetings, and you didn't have to have all that apparatus.

13:11.380 --> 13:16.080
One person could do it, but I didn't think I was conspicuous about it at that time.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.940
I didn't think anybody knew who I was.

13:19.600 --> 13:29.000
Later on, I was becoming more visible, and I realized that I probably could do it.

13:29.000 --> 13:41.920
The precipitating event was by receiving in the same week three requests for anthology reprints for flat C's, which I thought was unfair to the author.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.460
So I wrote a flyer, it's a one-page thing.

13:46.900 --> 13:52.480
Advising authors not to sign agreements for flat C anthology reprints and things.

13:52.600 --> 13:57.280
You'd like more information of this kind, send in your three bucks, and become a charter member of SFWA.

13:59.000 --> 14:07.220
I had about 78, I declared them the charter members, and wrote a set of bylaws and sent that around, and we were more of a business.

14:08.680 --> 14:18.200
The science fiction writers of America has helped authors in various ways, for example by helping them get better contracts from publishers by fighting legal battles and providing encouragement and professional recognition.

14:18.660 --> 14:24.360
Another thing Knight was responsible for was to act as the co-founder of the Milford Science Fiction Writers Conference in 1956.

14:24.820 --> 14:29.140
The Milford Conference was conceived by Knight and Judith Merrill as an aid to science fiction writers.

14:29.640 --> 14:34.560
It provided them with an opportunity to have their work read and criticized by other professional science fiction writers.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.060
Knight talks about how the Milford Conference began.

14:37.600 --> 14:48.760
Well, this was in the mid-50s, and for some reason, Judy Merrill and I got talking about the idea of having a writer's conference in Milford, Pennsylvania, which is a very small town in the Poconos.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.660
It was sort of the way you might talk about building a building and basement.

14:56.440 --> 15:07.000
And nothing was done about this until Judy and I went through the World Con in Detroit at the Kivon, and the courage that we were much more better than we realized.

15:08.440 --> 15:13.540
Well, that energized us, and we thought that, honestly, if we invited people to the Milford base, we'd actually come.

15:14.880 --> 15:21.900
And we sent out invitations. We got Jim Wisch to join the Mast Ed, funded more respectability.

15:23.540 --> 15:32.920
And this was the year in which the World Con was falling here. The World Con was in New York, so it was easier for people to get out there directly afterwards.

15:33.640 --> 15:38.060
And we got 40 people. Just amazing. It was quite intense.

15:39.600 --> 15:50.220
We had evening discussions that went on for several hours, and people raising their hands to do the next to speak. Quite exciting.

16:01.160 --> 16:07.940
A regular feature of the conference was the workshop, in which authors would submit manuscripts and have them criticized by other members of the conference.

16:08.400 --> 16:13.040
Damon Knight and his wife Kate Wellhelm now conduct the Clarion Workshop in science fiction and fantasy.

16:13.040 --> 16:20.580
The Clarion Workshop is based on the same idea as the Milford Workshop, though attending writers are beginners for the most part, and Knight and Wellhelm are the teachers.

16:20.980 --> 16:27.700
Professional writers of science fiction and beginning writers too, who have hopes of becoming established professionals, have a great deal to thank Damon Knight for.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.760
We'll talk with Damon Knight about one of his novels on our next show.

16:37.240 --> 16:46.320
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.740
Thanks for watching.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.460
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:00.760 --> 18:05.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.800
And here are your hosts.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.320
This is Daryl Lane.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.200
And David Carson.

18:16.620 --> 18:21.920
Damon Knight's best science fiction has a real cutting edge to it, some sort of satire, irony, or social criticism.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.240
A good example is a second novel published in 1959 as The People-Maker, but reissued under Knight's preferred title, A for Anything.

18:29.240 --> 18:34.900
The story focuses on the question of how society would change if a matter duplicator were suddenly given to mankind.

18:35.180 --> 18:41.440
The duplicator, called the gizmo, can copy anything, a tool, a building, a weapon, a vehicle, even a human being.

18:42.040 --> 18:47.500
Optimists may think society would be enormously benefited from such a device, but that's not the way it turns out in Knight's novel.

18:47.900 --> 18:48.500
Quite the reverse.

18:48.920 --> 18:54.660
The social structure becomes futile, with a few rich and powerful families controlling everything through the power of the gizmo.

18:54.660 --> 18:59.680
And slavery is a fact of life too. The majority of the people are poor and exploited by the powerful.

19:00.340 --> 19:07.540
For most of the novel, it seems the protagonist, the son of a rich and powerful gizmo owner, will aid in a slave revolt which will overthrow the oppressive society.

19:08.020 --> 19:13.960
But on the final page of the novel, he shoots the wise old slave who has been leading the revolt and chooses to remain a rich tyrant.

19:14.280 --> 19:19.100
It's got to be one of the most depressing endings a science fiction novel ever had. We asked Knight why he produced it.

19:20.040 --> 19:24.880
Well, what you're talking about, the ending that you expected is the cliche ending.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.360
Romantic and sentimental. I wanted to do a realistic ending.

19:30.320 --> 19:36.700
I thought that a happy ending to that, you know, conventional quote, happy ending to that novel would have been wrong.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.620
And this was one of the things that interested me in writing the novel in the first place.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.780
You know, anything I've done is a second cover of this plastic.

19:44.780 --> 19:56.880
I was trying to do science fiction realistically. I thought that was part of the new way that was called at then, but the way of realism, the cane and the fishing.

19:58.040 --> 20:02.460
And I was awfully acquired, still I am, of the romantic cliches of science fiction.

20:03.440 --> 20:08.700
We asked Knight why such a marvelous device as the gizmo would result in a tyrannical slave-oriented society.

20:08.700 --> 20:25.120
Well, I thought it was logical. I was counter punching in that novel against some other treatments of the same device, the same gadget that had been published before, which I thought were compouts.

20:25.900 --> 20:38.100
For instance, George O. Snedt wrote one in which the matter that the applicator was embedded and, of course, chaos ensued, and he rescued the world by inventing a kind of currency that couldn't be duplicated.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.100
And that was one too many rabbits out of a hat, I thought.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.480
So, again, I just wanted to do it realistically.

20:46.480 --> 21:00.400
It seemed to me that if I had made a good case that the fact that slavery would be the result, I admit that it was an imaginative projection.

21:00.740 --> 21:05.540
I don't necessarily defend the idea that that's what would happen in practice.

21:06.780 --> 21:13.380
And another writer, several years later, wrote a story in response to that one, which really delighted me.

21:13.500 --> 21:27.920
I like this dialogue and the second time, which in which he showed that a good marketer, a good business man could get along personally well and make money, even if there was a matter of duplicators.

21:28.780 --> 21:29.400
Marvelous story.

21:30.480 --> 21:37.640
We compared Knight's novel with Poe and Cornbluse, The Space Merchants, also published in the 1950s and also a sharp criticism of society.

21:38.120 --> 21:41.700
We asked him if criticism of that sort was normal in science fiction of the 50s.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.660
That has been dominant in science fiction up until that time.

22:02.780 --> 22:08.420
There had been social satire in science fiction for a long time before during science fiction.

22:09.440 --> 22:14.700
And the magazine published some of it, but it was pretty remote.

22:14.840 --> 22:18.700
It didn't have the cutting edge that the gravy planet had.

22:19.620 --> 22:21.260
More was Damon Knight next time.

22:28.300 --> 22:36.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:21.260 --> 23:24.740
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:40.460 --> 23:45.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:45.760 --> 23:50.060
And here are your hosts.

23:54.420 --> 23:55.540
This is Daryl Lane.

23:55.740 --> 23:56.440
And David Carson.

23:56.980 --> 24:00.040
A clever, sharp wit characterizes the science fiction of Damon Knight.

24:00.820 --> 24:06.420
His work is for the thinking reader, the type who appreciates irony, satire, unexpected twist and plot and ending.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.740
Much of his fiction is characterized by a critical or negative tone.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.140
His stories, for example, seldom have happy endings.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.360
We asked him if he was a pessimistic person.

24:14.360 --> 24:18.280
I'm not a pessimistic person in my daily life.

24:21.240 --> 24:26.160
I hate to word optimistic, but I'm cheerful most of the time.

24:26.860 --> 24:27.880
And I have a lot of fun.

24:28.040 --> 24:30.540
I don't worry too much about disasters in the future.

24:31.180 --> 24:35.160
I certainly don't enjoy seeing people flip on banana peels.

24:36.760 --> 24:42.460
But I like irony and surprising people in his stories.

24:44.460 --> 24:52.820
I just like very much the story that says everything is going to be rosy and filled with the very impossible way and everybody laughs it up.

24:52.940 --> 24:53.460
I don't know why.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.940
One of the stories in which Knight surprises his readers is entitled to serve man.

24:58.320 --> 25:04.260
It concerns a race of aliens who arrive on the earth and immediately put their superior technology to work to benefit the human race.

25:04.260 --> 25:06.860
One of the human's chances on a book of the aliens.

25:07.300 --> 25:10.820
He works hard to translate it and renders the title as to serve man.

25:11.320 --> 25:17.320
Everyone is pleased that the aliens great generosity and kindness until they find out on the last page of the story that the volume is a cookbook.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.640
Another witty effort is a story called The Country of the Kind.

25:21.300 --> 25:25.880
It takes place in a future world in which the entire human race is kind, humane and benevolent.

25:26.260 --> 25:33.280
Except for one single individual, a throwback, who is miserable because his violence and cruelty are tolerated by the general society around him.

25:33.280 --> 25:40.860
The story almost makes you feel sorry for the cruel and destructive man, since his insane actions have absolutely no effect on the blandness he's surrounded by.

25:41.380 --> 25:46.600
Knight's latest work, a novel entitled The World in Thorin, is one that he spent some 15 years on.

25:47.200 --> 25:53.800
It seems a departure from his previous writing and in fact the Berkeley paperback edition is labeled fantasy, but Knight disagrees with that designation.

25:54.700 --> 26:01.300
In the little introductory section of the chapter, I thought I had laid out more or less what happened.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.760
What's on the book is about to go over.

26:09.060 --> 26:14.200
People made a space about the earth and propelled it out of its alloy system.

26:16.240 --> 26:21.680
It also went underground to accommodate the recent population.

26:23.240 --> 26:29.980
But the planet under the control of a central computer, and then there was a war which destroyed civilization.

26:32.600 --> 26:41.200
Complete control was turned over to computers that were directed to do whatever was necessary for the welfare of the human being.

26:42.300 --> 26:56.800
And since the computers had not been told what welfare meant to human beings, it had to try to figure out what was the best of variety.

26:57.600 --> 27:08.160
And therefore, having sealed up these caverns in order to prevent another war, it promoted the growth of different kinds of cultures, each one in each little cavern.

27:09.380 --> 27:11.800
Hoping to find out eventually what the best one was.

27:12.660 --> 27:17.480
Hope will pass, but that was the world which the model takes place.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.840
I really thought I had indicated that sufficiently, but perhaps not.

27:22.220 --> 27:28.500
The world in Thorin is an episodic narrative. The protagonist, a lame young man named Thorin, journeys through caverns under the earth.

27:28.980 --> 27:34.300
And each cavern contains a separate race and a separate culture, and Thorin has an adventure of sorts with each one of them.

27:34.300 --> 27:38.800
Some of the episodes seem like complete short stories, and we ask night if they were published separately.

27:39.440 --> 27:43.120
That's right, Fred Thorin ran, I think, three of them in Galaxy.

27:44.340 --> 27:49.100
We have to go free for a back end of the files to find them, because it took me fifteen years to finish it.

27:49.940 --> 27:55.940
The world in Thorin doesn't have the bite or the satire that characterizes much of night's work, but it's an enjoyable and exciting novel.

27:56.500 --> 28:00.960
And this is what readers have come to expect of Damon Knight, one of the all-time masters of science fiction.

28:07.980 --> 28:16.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
