00:09.040 --> 00:13.020
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.260
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.700
And here are your hosts.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.860
This is Bill Vernon and David Crews.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.560
Philip Jose Farmer has been a mainstay science fiction writer since 1952.

00:52.800 --> 00:58.060
He has written over 40 novels and over 80 short stories focusing on a wide variety of subjects.

00:58.060 --> 01:04.700
These range from Tarzan to the afterlife, from sex-crazed aliens to a star-faring Catholic priest.

01:05.120 --> 01:13.420
Farmer's most famous works are the Riverworld series, the World of Tears series, his erotic fantasy novels, and the story, later a novel, The Lovers.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.260
We asked Farmer how he started writing science fiction.

01:16.620 --> 01:20.680
I started reading science fiction when I was seven years old.

01:20.960 --> 01:27.400
I'm 63 now, and I knew I always wanted to be a writer.

01:28.060 --> 01:30.380
Although I didn't do much about it for many years.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.660
The funny thing is, I actually intended to become a mainstream writer.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.960
That is, to write stories which are not in particular genre.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.860
But I somehow or other just drifted into science fiction.

01:45.980 --> 01:49.700
And sold my first science fiction story in 1952.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.080
That was called The Lovers.

01:52.320 --> 01:57.660
It was a novelette, which was published in a magazine.

01:57.660 --> 02:05.680
And it's generally credited with breaking the taboo against the mature use of sex in a science fiction magazine.

02:06.920 --> 02:11.440
We asked Farmer if he consciously set out to break taboos by writing The Lovers.

02:12.940 --> 02:18.680
No, I had an idea for a story, and I couldn't write it unless I broke the taboos.

02:18.720 --> 02:25.620
I didn't really consciously set out to do it, because I had the idea, and I thought it was terrific.

02:25.780 --> 02:29.260
On the other hand, I knew I was going to have a lot of trouble getting it accepted.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.020
And I did.

02:30.760 --> 02:31.900
I did have a lot of trouble.

02:34.540 --> 02:43.540
The first editor I sent it to, John Campbell, who was the editor of Astounding, was the most prestigious and the highest paying market.

02:43.940 --> 02:45.440
So naturally, I sent it to him first.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.300
And he returned it with a comment that nauseated him.

02:51.020 --> 02:59.720
So I sent it to Horace Gold, who was editing Galaxy, which was equally prestigious and had about the same word rates.

02:59.720 --> 03:03.580
His comments were something like John Campbell's.

03:04.440 --> 03:11.380
So then I sent it to Samuel Mines, who was editor of a magazine called Startling Stories.

03:13.340 --> 03:18.720
And he immediately accepted it and knew that it was a revolutionary breakthrough.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.540
I published it, and I was on my way.

03:23.940 --> 03:28.120
Except that the next story I wrote was also equally revolutionary.

03:28.120 --> 03:33.300
And it took me a year before I could get anybody to accept it.

03:35.600 --> 03:40.280
Farmer is also interested in religion in its varied forms, and has used it in his works.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.960
My interest in religion has manifested itself throughout all my works.

03:47.060 --> 03:52.240
Although a lot of people, when they say the name Farmer, immediately think of sex in the book.

03:52.920 --> 03:57.140
The fact is I've written much more about religion than about sex.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.960
Or sometimes both at the same time.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.840
But in some respects, sex and religion are two sides of the same coin.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.280
In certain fields of activity.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.200
But religion is only one of many themes.

04:20.740 --> 04:25.460
Farmer feels that he may have labored in relative anonymity for years because his writings are so varied.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.960
But he has his reasons.

04:27.700 --> 04:37.720
One of the reasons I've had trouble in the early days, I think, really becoming identified and getting a band of followers,

04:37.860 --> 04:40.520
is that I didn't beat on just one or two drums.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.340
I ranged all over the field.

04:43.580 --> 04:49.440
But I find out that if I do a variety of stuff, then I don't get tired.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.660
Each new novel is a new challenge.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.900
I'm not just working the same old theme again.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.040
Tomorrow we continue with more on Philip Jose Farmer.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.200
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:10.380 --> 05:13.120
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:13.400 --> 05:16.400
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:23.940 --> 05:43.260


05:43.500 --> 05:43.640


05:50.220 --> 05:52.000


05:53.560 --> 05:53.640


06:01.300 --> 06:05.280
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:20.580 --> 06:25.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.440
And here are your hosts.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.680
This is Bill Vernon and David Crews.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.480
We're continuing our interview with Philip Jose Farmer.

06:40.720 --> 06:45.420
We want to explore here some background related to one of Farmer's major themes, religion.

06:45.860 --> 06:51.800
As Farmer allowed earlier, he considers himself a writer of religious themes, even more so than a writer of sexual themes.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.440
His own religious background is quite checkered.

06:54.840 --> 07:01.460
I was sent to Sunday school when I was very little, and I became interested in the Bible, and I read it on my own.

07:01.940 --> 07:05.320
And I even read the Book of Mormon when I was about nine years old.

07:07.320 --> 07:18.080
And I always wrestled all my life with the problems of immortality, predestination, grace, the afterlife, and all that sort of stuff.

07:18.080 --> 07:26.280
I was raised as a Christian scientist up until the time I was about 12.

07:27.400 --> 07:39.680
And then I was sent to a Presbyterian church where there was a conflict between Christian science and the Presbyterian idea of predestination.

07:41.100 --> 07:45.060
And then when I was about 16, I guess I became an atheist.

07:45.400 --> 07:53.440
Now I've gone through atheism through agnosticism, and then I was converted to the disciples of Christ.

07:54.560 --> 08:01.760
And then I backslid, fell from grace, as the theological term goes.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.400
And then I lapsed back into agnosticism.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.100
And what are Farmer's present beliefs?

08:08.100 --> 08:14.860
My present situation is that without immortality, life has no meaning.

08:15.340 --> 08:18.580
And that if there's a creation, there must be a creator.

08:19.960 --> 08:27.320
But I've become tremendously interested in what to sometimes refer to as mythicism.

08:27.320 --> 08:34.420
It isn't really like the Muslim Sufism school.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.700
Then a lot of related stuff like that.

08:41.500 --> 08:45.220
You might say right now, I'm in a sort of a limbo.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.080
Heading towards something, I don't know what.

08:48.080 --> 08:52.180
The concept of an afterlife appears repeatedly in Farmer's works.

08:52.960 --> 08:58.860
Well, if you think about it, you know, there could be a million different possibilities in an afterlife if there were.

08:58.860 --> 09:11.020
But one of my perhaps unstated themes is that immortality may not depend upon a supernatural being.

09:11.020 --> 09:19.480
That it's in the evolutionary drive of man for him to invent immortality himself.

09:21.100 --> 09:26.740
Well, the drawback to that is those people who are already dead will remain dead, right?

09:26.740 --> 09:37.760
So that doesn't correspond to the religious idea of immortality, where everybody is raised from the first human being to the last one.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.580
I like to do a lot of variations on that.

09:41.860 --> 09:46.200
I have a new book called The Unreasoning Mask.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.120
That's the location of Moby Dick.

09:48.810 --> 09:56.840
And this is concerned with theology, afterlife, immortality.

09:57.890 --> 10:01.700
You might call it a philosophical-theological space opera.

10:18.220 --> 10:21.540
Many of Farmer's first works had the central theme of religion.

10:21.840 --> 10:27.800
The Lovers and A Woman a Day deal with a future amalgamation of church and state called the Sturch.

10:27.960 --> 10:34.120
A popular character, Father John Carmody, is a planet-hopping Catholic priest who has appeared in several short stories.

10:34.360 --> 10:38.840
We learn about his former life and conversion in the excellent novel Night of Light.

10:39.540 --> 10:43.400
Inside Outside is a wild tale about the afterlife and immortality.

10:43.400 --> 10:48.940
It is, in fact, the predecessor to the famous Riverworld series, which we will discuss in our next show.

10:56.240 --> 11:01.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:01.960 --> 11:04.960
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:20.700 --> 11:25.660


11:25.660 --> 11:29.520


11:29.520 --> 11:30.500


11:30.500 --> 11:33.560


11:50.720 --> 11:54.640
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:10.200 --> 12:15.560
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.960
And here are your hosts.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.980
This is Bill Vernon and David Crews.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.320
Having looked into Philip Jose Farmer's feelings on religion and immortality,

12:31.320 --> 12:33.820
we began a look today at the Riverworld Series.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.420
Farmer explains the basis of the story.

12:37.320 --> 12:44.220
It concerns the planet in which there's a 10 million mile long river, which follows the valley.

12:44.640 --> 12:55.360
And everybody that lived from about 150,000 B.C. to about 1883 A.D. was resurrected along the banks of the river.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.300
And rejuvenated for them. Looks like there were 25.

12:59.300 --> 13:08.440
And the main mystery behind the whole thing was, why were all these people resurrected?

13:10.560 --> 13:12.380
Who did it and how?

13:13.360 --> 13:18.000
But the Riverworld concept is so big that Farmer has managed only to scratch the surface

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
in the four main novels of the series.

13:20.940 --> 13:26.620
There are so many themes that I wanted to explore during the course of those four novels,

13:26.780 --> 13:32.120
but I couldn't do it because I would have slowed the story down too much.

13:33.220 --> 13:35.760
It would have taken too many sidetracks, you might say.

13:35.820 --> 13:39.380
I might still be working on that particular series.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.000
What else is left?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.580
Listen to Farmer as he gives us an inkling of what he would like to cover.

13:45.620 --> 13:53.560
I didn't go into any detail on how you could work out viable societies with people from every place and every time.

13:55.060 --> 14:04.180
I also wanted to bring up in depth what would happen to famous people on that planet.

14:04.420 --> 14:08.180
Like, well, there's Karl Marx, for instance.

14:09.640 --> 14:16.500
What would he think of what happened to his ideas about communism on the planet Earth after he died?

14:18.580 --> 14:28.560
Leonardo da Vinci, his ideas about art, plus the fact that he's on a planet where there are very few pigments available,

14:28.740 --> 14:29.880
for instance, for him to paint.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.880
What would he do there?

14:34.980 --> 14:44.340
I also wanted to bring up various figures from science and the military and philosophy and so forth,

14:45.140 --> 14:46.560
show what they would do there.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.380
Now, one of the things about the riverworld was that,

14:51.180 --> 14:54.680
although you were resurrected there in a youthful body of your own,

14:55.340 --> 14:59.440
as it was in 25 or earlier, if you died in 425,

15:01.920 --> 15:04.700
if, for instance, you were 83 when you died,

15:04.880 --> 15:09.740
you know, your mind is still 83 and you have 83 years of experience on Earth behind you,

15:12.220 --> 15:14.720
now, is your character formed?

15:15.120 --> 15:20.360
Are you going to go through perhaps a thousand years being the same person?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.620
Or are you going to improve?

15:22.980 --> 15:26.240
And is the magic labyrinth the last word on the Riverworld?

15:27.080 --> 15:28.920
I made a lot of people mad at me.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.960
Because of that last sentence there, or paragraph, I should say,

15:35.040 --> 15:38.500
that I wrote in the magic labyrinth, everything seems to have been settled.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.220
Everything has been cleared up.

15:42.500 --> 15:58.100
And then one of the characters, the kind of minor one, Peter Jairus Frigate, he's celebrating with the others in the misty tower, when he thinks he hears a footfall outside in the hallway.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.420
He blows out, comes back, and says to the others,

16:02.980 --> 16:05.380
I didn't see anyone, it must have been my imagination.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.760
A lot of readers got mad at me because they thought,

16:07.760 --> 16:09.220
oh no, he's going to write another one.

16:10.120 --> 16:13.060
He's leaving a loophole. Well, I am leaving a loophole.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.780
And I don't know whether I'll go through it or not.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.260
But it's quite possible that the magic labyrinth

16:19.260 --> 16:24.140
wasn't the final one in that series before.

16:24.380 --> 16:29.100
That everything that our protagonist learned,

16:29.100 --> 16:30.600
and everything that everybody else learned,

16:30.820 --> 16:33.880
is completely untrue or half true.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.740
So the Riverworld novels may or may not be finished,

16:37.760 --> 16:40.740
but we do have some more sidestream stories to anticipate.

16:40.940 --> 16:42.440
More on Farmer tomorrow.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.480
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:52.640 --> 16:55.340
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:55.340 --> 16:58.620
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:08.860 --> 17:09.280


17:43.740 --> 17:46.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

17:46.560 --> 17:47.660
so stay with us.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.880
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

18:06.100 --> 18:08.680
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.100
And here are your hosts.

18:17.980 --> 18:20.320
This is Bill Vernon and David Crews.

18:20.580 --> 18:23.980
Our show today continues the discussion with Philip Jose Farmer.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.920
A major incident in Farmer's career began when Venus on the Half-Shell,

18:28.160 --> 18:30.400
a novel written under the pseudonym Kilgore Trout,

18:30.600 --> 18:34.900
appeared in the pages of fantasy and science fiction in late 74, early 75.

18:35.320 --> 18:38.600
Of course, Kilgore Trout is the creation of author Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.

18:39.020 --> 18:42.680
The character Trout is an impoverished, underappreciated science fiction writer

18:42.680 --> 18:44.840
who appears in a number of Vonnegut's novels.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.840
We asked Farmer if he identifies with Kilgore Trout.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.780
I was a fan of Vonnegut's novels.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.440
I liked all his books, but Kilgore Trout really turned me on

18:54.440 --> 18:59.500
because his early experiences, and as a matter of fact his later ones too,

19:00.200 --> 19:02.720
were like a lot of my early experiences,

19:02.840 --> 19:08.020
and a lot like the experiences of many other science fiction writers.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.200
Back in the old days when they weren't being paid much,

19:11.200 --> 19:13.700
and science fiction was looked down upon,

19:14.600 --> 19:20.380
and we were being taken due to our inexperience by various publishers and agents.

19:22.140 --> 19:24.900
Also, I had a tough time getting any recognition.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.000
So, I guess that's why I identified with him,

19:29.280 --> 19:30.760
plus the fact he's a great character.

19:32.260 --> 19:37.140
Vonnegut did not appreciate the reviews given Venus on the Half-Shell, either pro or con,

19:37.140 --> 19:40.860
because most of the reviewers approached the work as if Vonnegut were the author.

19:41.140 --> 19:45.700
This caused Farmer the opportunity to write another novel under the Kilgore Trout pseudonym.

19:46.820 --> 19:49.920
I don't know what his reactions are to the novel itself,

19:50.020 --> 19:54.880
but so many people thought that he'd written it,

19:55.040 --> 19:57.540
and he would tell you it's hundreds of maybe thousands,

19:57.880 --> 20:00.820
but then the reviews came out.

20:01.460 --> 20:04.200
Some said Venus on the Half Shell by Kilgore Trout.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.560
It was the worst thing he'd written,

20:07.640 --> 20:09.620
and others said it was the best thing he'd ever written.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.780
When I applied for permission to write The Son of Jimmy Valentine,

20:14.980 --> 20:17.080
which I really would have loved to have done,

20:17.240 --> 20:23.360
because I could have had a lot of fun with it, he said no, which is his prerogative.

20:24.580 --> 20:29.160
We asked if The Son of Jimmy Valentine was Kilgore Trout's one erotic novel.

20:30.340 --> 20:35.820
It was his, uh, not only his one and only specifically erotic book,

20:35.860 --> 20:38.780
it was also his only non-science fiction book.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.720
Farmer obviously enjoys writing about fictional authors,

20:42.780 --> 20:45.900
who in turn write about their own fictional authors, and so on.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.240
Listen as he describes what writing as Kilgore Trout started.

20:50.240 --> 20:58.780
In the Venus on the Half-Shell, uh, the protagonist, Simon Wagstaff, had his favorite science fiction author.

20:59.720 --> 21:09.300
Just as in the Vonnegut books, Eliot Rosewater thought that Kilgore Trout was the greatest, uh, living writer, you know, in any field.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.700
He should have been president of the U.S.

21:10.760 --> 21:11.940
He could have solved all the problems.

21:12.460 --> 21:29.340
Well, anyway, in Venus on the Half Shell, uh, Simon Wagstaff liked to read the science fiction works of a fellow called Jonathan Swift Somers III, and I described his various works, or Al Bynum, and give the title.

21:30.240 --> 21:44.680
But Jonathan Swift Somers, who's a fiction author, wrote about a giant German shepherd police dog, whose IQ had been raised to about 200 in a laboratory, and he became a private detective.

21:45.840 --> 21:56.200
Now, uh, I plan eventually someday on writing a book by Ralph von Valvao, this dog, under the, under the name of Ralph von Valvao.

21:57.580 --> 22:10.140
And then maybe I'll end the cycle by having Ralph von Valvao write about a human named, uh, Vonnegut, or something like that, and completing it, going right back to Vonnegut again.

22:11.280 --> 22:19.400
Farmer conceived of the extended family group called the Wold-Newton family, in which many great historical and fictional characters are descended from the Scarlet Pimpernel.

22:19.740 --> 22:26.120
Thus, Kilgore Trout is related to Sherlock Holmes, Doc Savage, Sam Spade, and James Bond, among others.

22:26.360 --> 22:29.660
We will look into this aspect of Farmer's writing some more tomorrow.

22:37.060 --> 22:39.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:39.780 --> 22:42.520
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:42.820 --> 22:45.780
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:09.440 --> 23:15.560


23:32.320 --> 23:35.000
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:35.180 --> 23:36.240
so stay with us.

23:51.700 --> 23:54.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:54.480 --> 23:57.060
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.480
And here are your hosts.

24:06.260 --> 24:08.640
This is Bill Vernon and David Crews.

24:08.940 --> 24:12.060
This show will conclude our interview with Philip Jose Farmer.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.700
Yesterday, we discussed Farmer's penchant for writing under pseudonyms.

24:15.820 --> 24:19.160
As it turns out, this practice has a very desirable side effect.

24:20.280 --> 24:28.980
One of the funny things about this is that I found out that I could use the fictional author device to break a writing block.

24:29.360 --> 24:35.580
I had a writing block once, that terrible thing that sometimes happens to writers.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.460
They don't know what causes it.

24:38.640 --> 24:44.980
For some reason, they might have many ideas, be eager to go, but when they sit down in front of a typewriter, nothing happens.

24:46.420 --> 24:50.940
Well, that happened to me once. I never thought it would.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.460
I thought I was immune to such a thing.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.580
But it did.

24:54.540 --> 24:57.480
And after wrestling for two months and getting no place,

24:58.140 --> 24:59.160
I had an idea.

25:00.640 --> 25:10.780
I sat down with the typewriter and wrote a story, not by Philip Jose Farmer, but by David Copperfield, they'd say.

25:11.580 --> 25:13.640
I don't remember which particular nom, the clue maybe.

25:14.200 --> 25:21.580
Uh, story poured out. Very good. Um, I thought so anyway.

25:22.740 --> 25:26.120
Uh, when I'd completed that, the writing block was gone.

25:26.120 --> 25:32.320
See, I wasn't writing then as me, Philip Jose Farmer, but as, Kilgore Trout.

25:33.480 --> 25:36.140
And, I was in his shoes. I had no trouble.

25:36.420 --> 25:48.440
Now, the funny thing about this is, it's a, uh, it's a psychological trick that I'm conscious of, see. Uh, and yet it works.

25:50.260 --> 25:54.860
It's not like I'm trying to trick my unconscious, but I must be doing it, one way or another.

25:57.240 --> 26:03.880
Well, I don't, I don't know of anybody else who's ever broken a writer's block in that manner, but I recommend trying it.

26:05.280 --> 26:09.960
Farmer has also written several books featuring Tarzan or Tarzan-like characters.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.560
Tarzan Alive is Tarzan's biography.

26:12.920 --> 26:18.480
The erotic novel, A Feast Unknown, and its clean sequels, The Mad Goblin and Lord of the Trees,

26:18.680 --> 26:28.500
feature thinly veiled versions of Tarzan and Doc Savage, Lord Tiger, The Opar Books, and The Adventures of the Peerless Peer also have Tarzan-like protagonists.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.760
We asked Farmer when he developed his interest in Tarzan.

26:32.580 --> 26:42.760
I first read Tarzan when I guess I was about seven or eight years old and I became wrapped up in that early age with the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs.

26:44.800 --> 26:50.740
And, but when I started college, I kind of lost interest and didn't read them anymore.

26:56.500 --> 27:01.300
But later, Farmer picked up on Tarzan again. This time he saw Tarzan in a different light.

27:02.400 --> 27:06.700
I started reading books about Tarzan again and this time,

27:07.900 --> 27:21.900
although I still kept a lot of my childhood interest in him, a sense of wonder about him, I began seeing things in Tarzan, for instance, I had not seen before.

27:23.260 --> 27:35.120
He was not, not just a child who'd been cast away and raised by great apes and then become a creature of the jungle and then return to claim fortune.

27:35.140 --> 27:45.120
He was sort of a, an archetype of many, many heroes from classical myths.

27:45.920 --> 27:50.940
And now, I'm sure that when Burroughs wrote this, he didn't know what he was doing but he did it unconsciously.

27:51.260 --> 27:54.560
I think that it's the creation of Tarzan and the stroke of genius.

27:55.600 --> 27:59.540
Burroughs is not a great writer but he has, he has a great character

27:59.540 --> 28:06.940
just like A. Conan Doyle is not a great writer but he created a great character. Sherlock Holmes.

28:07.680 --> 28:15.900
Philip Jose Farmer, an author with a seemingly endless supply of unique ideas who appears just now to be gaining widespread acceptance.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.020
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:26.220 --> 28:28.920
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:29.220 --> 28:32.200
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.820
