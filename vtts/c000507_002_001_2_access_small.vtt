00:05.100 --> 00:06.460
Okay, tape is running again.

00:09.960 --> 00:15.340
Okay, I've counted the books that I think you've got published so far and I've come

00:15.340 --> 00:17.380
up with about 12 or 13, is that right?

00:17.740 --> 00:19.340
I would imagine that's about right.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.560
Okay, I think I've read everything that you had out at the present time.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.020
My personal favorite is the Fated Sun trilogy.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.060
You've only made one comment on that which sort of answered one of my questions,

00:33.460 --> 00:35.060
which is it pronounced the Marie?

00:35.480 --> 00:36.100
Marie, yes.

00:36.200 --> 00:40.520
Marie, if you'd modeled them in any cultures, you've already answered that one.

00:43.960 --> 00:52.080
I guess what I'll ask you is what do you, as their creator or Duncan, the human who lives with them,

00:52.550 --> 00:54.180
what do you admire about them?

00:56.950 --> 01:06.900
I think that for one thing, I, about Marie, I think I admire their steadfastness,

01:07.860 --> 01:19.640
their ability to face time itself with tranquility in the sense that they can take the long view,

01:20.300 --> 01:27.520
which is a thing that is absolutely necessary in my mind for civilized survival.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.900
Mind, I don't say just survival, but civilized survival.

01:31.740 --> 01:37.380
Is there ability to look down the centuries and see consequences?

01:40.080 --> 01:42.620
The Marie sense of time is a very strange thing.

01:43.300 --> 01:48.900
A Marie always lives now, and that now is a composite of the past,

01:50.100 --> 01:52.720
current events, and the future, simultaneously.

01:54.240 --> 02:03.320
They do not view time as the modern American does, which is more or less a set of beads on the string

02:03.320 --> 02:07.980
that we can snip off any tail of the string that seems inconvenient to us.

02:08.740 --> 02:24.000
The Marie concept of the universe is holistic, and their ability to perceive that all of time impacts on every moment that they live,

02:24.780 --> 02:33.180
I think is one of the things that I most enjoy about that, about that species.

02:34.620 --> 02:39.760
What about Duncan? Why does he choose to give up his, in a sense, give up his humanity and become one of them?

02:41.340 --> 02:46.080
Well, the character of Duncan himself, he will recall that he has no past.

02:47.500 --> 02:56.740
He was born in the war, probably an orphan, very early in life, transferred to a state nursery,

02:58.320 --> 03:09.940
and brought up to fight, essentially to pay for his existence by becoming a soldier in a war that had gone on much longer than made sense for anyone.

03:11.980 --> 03:18.100
When he encountered the Marie, he is a very symptom man in many ways.

03:18.200 --> 03:25.180
He's highly educated in his narrow field of specialization. The state saw to that.

03:26.680 --> 03:33.220
But when he encounters the Marie, he cannot sympathize with the diplomats, with anything else that's going on.

03:34.020 --> 03:44.460
But what he considered to be another soldier from his viewpoint, with a soldier's morality, he could comprehend and respect that.

03:45.760 --> 03:51.720
That respect then led him to a deeper understanding of the people.

03:53.620 --> 04:06.360
To me, one of the more pathetic things in the story is Duncan himself, who is attacking the Regal Library, attempting a completely uneducated man in many ways,

04:07.060 --> 04:11.340
attempting to understand the culture that he has just contributed to destroying.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.920
And he becomes obsessed with it.

04:17.080 --> 04:24.500
He finally conceives it as a moral responsibility of his own, and thereby falls into a trap,

04:25.980 --> 04:37.140
because his humanity, his sense of moral responsibility, his feeling of blame for what has happened, leads him to attempt to save these people.

04:38.000 --> 04:48.240
And once he has done that, he discovers that if he remains what he is, namely human,

04:50.000 --> 04:56.180
that will as effectively destroy them as any bomb any attack could do.

04:57.260 --> 05:14.620
So, his final sacrifice in a sort of a redemptive sense is that he finally agrees that he will no longer attempt to be human.

05:15.180 --> 05:17.760
That he begins to try to be something else.

05:18.400 --> 05:27.980
Even in that, there is a considerable hazard, because if the transition is not complete, he may end up contaminating the culture,

05:28.720 --> 05:31.960
which to the Marie and their way of life is a very, very serious thing.

05:32.660 --> 05:40.440
But it is a voluntary and conscious decision that is effectively at his personal suicide.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.200
And he takes it because he feels responsible for what has happened.

05:48.600 --> 06:00.180
Okay, I think it was in the second book of the series, there was a particular episode that, I guess of all your writing, this I think got to me the most,

06:00.900 --> 06:04.080
is the game called Shonhai Shonai.

06:05.160 --> 06:12.860
When I was making the jumps back to the Marie home world, and I guess it's Naoyunas or Niunas teaching him the Shonai game.

06:15.540 --> 06:22.420
I was fascinated enough about that to wonder if there was any model behind that particular game and its purpose or its intention.

06:26.080 --> 06:31.560
I suppose that if I thought very far back into my childhood, I could think of games that I played that were similar.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.700
Rhythm games, games of coordination.

06:37.460 --> 06:43.120
The game to the Marie is a form of literature.

06:44.620 --> 06:48.380
It contains the relationships of the people.

06:49.600 --> 06:55.000
And as such, I suppose the great deal of it was made up completely out of whole cloth.

06:55.000 --> 07:11.140
Because from simply the initial thought of a rhythm game, the original concept as I had it was simply a rhythm or a chant.

07:12.240 --> 07:21.580
And beyond that, the concept grew as my understanding of the Marie increased just by working with that sort of culture.

07:22.780 --> 07:29.720
Until I began to realize that if you're playing this thing as dangerously as they play it,

07:31.000 --> 07:36.960
that it's going to make a great deal of difference in terms of the weaknesses and strengths of the players.

07:37.960 --> 07:48.620
It's going to have a great deal to say about the interdependencies and independences, if you will, of the individuals within the community.

07:48.620 --> 07:54.460
Who can play with whom, who sets opposite whom, who is allied to whom.

07:56.460 --> 08:04.840
And it also has to do with the philosophy of the people, which again has to do with the great now.

08:05.440 --> 08:13.060
The ability to turn loose of a thing and to live for the moment which stretches in all directions in time.

08:15.560 --> 08:23.020
To, as Neon puts it, open the hand and let go, which is one of the hardest things that Duncan has to learn.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.980
Okay, one more question on those books.

08:29.480 --> 08:36.180
It seemed to me that you did leave an opening at the end of the third volume, and I wanted to ask if you perhaps could have any plans to continue with Marie.

08:38.580 --> 08:41.580
Yes, there is a possibility of that.

08:42.040 --> 08:53.400
I had to work so intensely with that culture for quite a while that I do not at present trust myself to tamper with it.

08:55.640 --> 09:01.300
I think that like the Morgane book, there is a possibility of my going back and working with it again.

09:01.880 --> 09:09.340
As a matter of fact, I already have sort of the germ of an idea, but it will have to gather months for quite a while.

09:10.980 --> 09:16.480
I want to make sure that if I disturb them again, it's for a worthy cause.

09:18.260 --> 09:26.260
And not just to write a book to be a sequel, but to be sure that it is a kind of story that could only be told with Marie.

09:26.940 --> 09:30.520
That's one of the penalties of working with cultures.

09:30.920 --> 09:38.240
You lose the ability to say, well, I would like to write a story, and I think I will write a story with these people.

09:39.380 --> 09:49.400
When the story that I told is wound as deeply into the culture and history of a species as the fated sun was,

09:50.220 --> 09:55.140
you have to come up with another kind of story which could only be told about that culture.

09:58.540 --> 10:00.480
Okay, let me run to one more work.

10:02.380 --> 10:06.500
What was the impetus behind the short stories in the book Sunfall?

10:06.880 --> 10:11.320
It's so different than the other things you've done. I wondered what was behind that?

10:11.840 --> 10:14.540
Well, it's different perhaps than other things which have come to light.

10:15.780 --> 10:19.080
But I think that I've traveled a great deal about the world.

10:19.080 --> 10:26.020
I've been in, well, let me think, I've been to Rome and to London.

10:27.740 --> 10:31.140
I've never been in Paris actually, but I've been all over France.

10:35.860 --> 10:40.100
And Istanbul, which didn't make it in, I was going to do an Istanbul story.

10:40.760 --> 10:45.080
And yet, I've never been to Peking either.

10:45.080 --> 10:54.900
But basically, I began thinking about the organism of a city as an entity.

10:56.280 --> 11:01.700
The concept of a city having a personality different than all other things.

11:03.380 --> 11:07.820
You go to New York and you could not mistake it for Rome.

11:08.900 --> 11:13.740
It's just the composite of people living there gives it a different flavor,

11:14.140 --> 11:19.700
a different case, a different style than any other place.

11:21.600 --> 11:26.500
Also, to a certain extent, I suppose it's psychologically related to the fated sun.

11:27.860 --> 11:33.440
Because when I was thinking about another species at the end of time, I wondered,

11:34.640 --> 11:39.860
what about the Earth when we're very, very old?

11:40.920 --> 11:43.760
What sort of things might we preserve as our artifacts?

11:45.000 --> 11:51.540
And the idea occurred to me that one of the things that humanity has created,

11:52.860 --> 12:00.240
which for all we know may be unique to humanity, is this concept we call city.

12:01.940 --> 12:12.020
And consequently, the story arose with the cities differentiating from each other

12:12.020 --> 12:15.180
to such an extent that we return to the age of the city-state.

12:16.140 --> 12:22.860
Civilization is slowly being canceled just because of the interval of distance and time

12:22.860 --> 12:25.560
and the difference of culture over the years.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.480
Who was the idea of the city, the idea behind that book would have been conceived

12:32.960 --> 12:36.220
before you wrote the short stories or did you write the short stories individually

12:36.220 --> 12:38.540
and then sort of think of a way to put them together?

12:38.940 --> 12:44.060
Well, actually, the initial story in the whole piece was the Rome story.

12:45.060 --> 12:52.900
George Sithers then with Isaac Asimov's magazines had shown me a cover

12:53.520 --> 12:58.040
which contained a fantastical number of elements.

12:59.720 --> 13:04.880
And sort of on a bad ask if I could write a short story based on that.

13:05.260 --> 13:11.180
Because back in the old days, you know, writers did used to write stories to fit the covers rather than the other way around.

13:12.800 --> 13:19.120
So I undertook it and George's comment on the story was about that

13:19.120 --> 13:23.980
but most editors make on my short stories which was this seems to be connected to something else,

13:25.700 --> 13:28.060
probably the affliction of novelists, you see.

13:29.840 --> 13:37.120
But I wrote that one in a lay about a while and then, you know, at the World Convention,

13:37.360 --> 13:40.940
they're always asking you to do readings in your work and I didn't have one.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.940
So I sat down and wrote The Only Death in the City

13:46.660 --> 13:52.380
as sort of inspired by the Rome story and that one's set in Paris

13:52.940 --> 13:55.780
so that I had something to read at the World Convention which I did.

13:56.680 --> 14:01.380
Then it suddenly struck me that I had two stories which were obviously connected to something else

14:01.380 --> 14:10.800
and finally it dawned on me that I could do several more of them since they were of an untidy length

14:11.580 --> 14:13.640
and I actually have a book.

14:15.620 --> 14:23.880
So out of all that broth of thinking about the world over the age and the character of cities

14:23.880 --> 14:32.220
and the fact that I had two of them in hand, why I sat down and wrote several of them right in the string, one after the other.

14:34.500 --> 14:39.560
Okay, I got the impression with some of those stories, for instance, the Paris one in the Moscow one,

14:39.720 --> 14:43.860
that you may have consciously been modeling them on a folk tale method.

14:43.860 --> 14:46.600
They seem very much like a folk tale or a fairy tale to me almost.

14:48.440 --> 14:55.060
It wouldn't be surprising because I've done a great deal of work in this.

14:55.680 --> 15:11.000
I also personally tend to believe that folk tales are a fairly accurate form of preserving the group consciousness of the people,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.580
the retellings of them through the centuries.

15:13.800 --> 15:19.440
Everybody adds their own veneer, their own layer of experience so that some of our very old stories

15:20.000 --> 15:23.340
acquire more and more significances the older they get.

15:23.720 --> 15:28.360
Cinderella being a good case in point which has been changed in practically every century.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.960
It's been retold to fit the current myth of.

15:34.100 --> 15:45.300
In the Paris one, I think that I was not consciously drawing on any single fairy tale that I can think of,

15:45.640 --> 15:54.440
but in the Russian one, definitely, I don't know, frankly, I don't know very much about Moscow.

15:54.680 --> 16:00.920
I literally had to look up a city plan to find out what it was like.

16:01.960 --> 16:11.440
I had to look up about old Moscow and to see how far it stretched and probably what the first settlement was,

16:11.540 --> 16:15.860
where the first building stood and why and all of this sort of thing.

16:16.560 --> 16:22.540
Once I determined that and I began thinking back on all the quintessential Russian stories that I'd ever heard,

16:22.680 --> 16:25.600
most of which seemed to involve roles in one form or another.

16:27.400 --> 16:31.640
I thought of the character of the land and I have studied Russian.

16:31.980 --> 16:44.660
I have taken the Russian language so that I know something about the literature and I know something about the interrelations of the words,

16:44.880 --> 16:51.120
what concepts are related to other words and what words are psychologically important within the language.

16:51.580 --> 16:56.420
So I just stirred all that together and came out with the Moscow story.

16:58.340 --> 17:00.720
Okay, one more observation or question on that book.

17:03.240 --> 17:07.280
You didn't have in mind any echo of the dying earth, did you?

17:07.380 --> 17:11.620
Were the earths living its last days in the various cultures on it or at their end?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.380
Well, I won't say that I was unconscious of it.

17:14.900 --> 17:24.060
The dying earth is something I read so long ago that I think that I'm almost ready to reread it as I do things which I enjoy a great deal.

17:26.400 --> 17:33.020
Having forgotten some of the salient details of it so deeply that I think that now again I can enjoy it.

17:33.540 --> 17:41.420
As I did the first time, I do recall that I liked it a great deal, but I cannot for the life of me remember exactly what went on in it.

17:42.820 --> 17:55.980
Which is the kind of reader I am. When I really am loving a book, I begin to attempt to blur it in my mind and forget it as rapidly as possible so that I can have the pleasure of rereading it within a year or so.

17:58.860 --> 18:21.100
I think that some of the influences on my writing in later periods than the first ones that I named have been Jack Vance and Fritz Leiber and so on.

18:22.040 --> 18:26.020
I don't think that one can remain unaffected by those ideas.

18:27.660 --> 18:37.820
Both of those writers have written on topics that I'm very fond of which is the urban community and fantasy.

18:38.980 --> 18:46.640
There often you know fantasy pits one lone barbarian wandering off across an icy landscape coping with what comes.

18:47.920 --> 19:01.120
But the urban community in fantasy is the province of those two writers in particular that I think of at the moment and definitely they have had their influence.

19:02.400 --> 19:24.000
Whether subconscious or direct, I did receive a very kind letter from Fritz Leiber who was kind enough to say that he had read Sunfall and we shared some feelings for cities.

19:29.120 --> 19:37.420
I think that has impressed me a great deal over the work that has been out that I've read of yours is the flexibility of your style.

19:38.240 --> 19:43.340
I read it if you consciously work at a particular style for a particular book.

19:44.560 --> 19:49.440
Do you change it? Do you alter anything in terms of the story and the kind of book you're writing?

19:50.100 --> 19:53.640
I suppose that has to do with being a bit of a linguist.

19:55.260 --> 20:08.240
There's also the fact that I have to break myself or writing an actillic examiner or Virgil students will know what I mean.

20:10.140 --> 20:16.360
And in some books I do allow myself to slip into a little bit more poetic style.

20:17.460 --> 20:22.840
It also seems to me that one style should be appropriate to the story that one is telling.

20:23.640 --> 20:36.160
So that if you're telling a story about nomads whose very means of expression is going to be perhaps figurative and poetical,

20:36.160 --> 20:40.380
then you can do this sort of thing in the faded sun for instance.

20:40.740 --> 20:51.760
These styles vary radically from chapter to chapter according to whether I happen to be dealing with the nomadic culture of the Marie

20:51.760 --> 20:59.300
or whether I'm dealing with the humans who tend to their narration background tends to be much more stark and efficient.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.880
I've worked in Dear Fantasy stories where I've looked at the language myself and looked back on it and thought,

21:08.020 --> 21:11.700
oh my goodness, I think I've been writing in rhythm again.

21:13.940 --> 21:20.420
A habit of which I try to cure myself because I do try to write prose.

21:22.620 --> 21:26.200
In Down Below Station the style varies again.

21:27.160 --> 21:34.100
That is I think fairly bold, modern style.

21:34.880 --> 21:39.360
And I guess that I just view it as a part of the composition.

21:41.100 --> 21:47.380
For instance, if I were doing a portrait as an artist, as a Renaissance person,

21:48.340 --> 21:52.920
I think I would automatically tend to fall into Renaissance style in my drawing and my painting,

21:54.540 --> 21:59.420
rather than trying to be a Cubist or a Pointillist or whatever.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.760
It's the same way with my handling of words.

22:03.060 --> 22:13.340
If I'm talking on a subject that is itself old and my style is different than one in which I'm talking about computers,

22:13.980 --> 22:15.120
unless I'm making a point.

22:16.720 --> 22:21.140
If I were for instance talking about a computer as a vehicle of prophecy,

22:21.160 --> 22:27.100
I might deliberately fall back into an older mode of expression relating it back to Delacy or something.

22:32.080 --> 22:36.580
Well, I find that's one of the hardest things in the world in writing sequels,

22:37.360 --> 22:40.780
is because my mode of expression changes also with time.

22:41.980 --> 22:47.360
It's very, very difficult for me to go back and to recapture the language of a particular book.

22:47.900 --> 22:52.220
I have to reread it myself several times to fall back into that mode of expression.

22:54.260 --> 22:55.840
Yeah, I would imagine I would be true.

22:57.260 --> 23:01.640
That sort of brings up another question I was going to ask you.

23:04.360 --> 23:10.680
When you start to write a book, do you entirely plot the thing out and have it fixed

23:10.680 --> 23:16.040
and then simply put it on paper or do you just get in the mood and just let it come out whatever comes?

23:17.520 --> 23:20.940
There's only one book that I've written straight through.

23:22.220 --> 23:25.900
From beginning to end, well maybe two.

23:26.740 --> 23:34.220
I did a number of false starts. I have about ten to fifteen different beginnings for Gator Bebrell.

23:34.640 --> 23:42.500
After it gets beyond chapter five, then everything proceeds like a straight line to the end.

23:43.340 --> 23:47.420
Many of the later chapters are written first draft, which is very unusual for me.

23:47.940 --> 23:50.040
Eight drafts is not unusual in a book.

23:52.800 --> 23:56.300
The paper I generate is really phenomenal.

23:57.100 --> 24:06.120
I have filled a, I could literally fill a bushel basket without taking some motion novels.

24:07.820 --> 24:16.480
But the one that I did write virtually from start to finish without a glitch was Wave Without a Shore.

24:18.340 --> 24:21.840
That one I just started at chapter one.

24:22.180 --> 24:25.460
Pardon me, from chapter one to the very end.

24:25.880 --> 24:33.760
It was virtually all first draft and although I think I went through three.

24:36.580 --> 24:41.480
That was it. Most of the others I find that I don't even start at the beginning of the book.

24:42.020 --> 24:47.960
What is now chapter eight in The Fated Sun started out as chapter one and so on.

24:48.300 --> 24:53.640
Like my literary idol Virgil, I tend to write in both directions at once.

24:53.980 --> 25:00.860
I sort of begin at a point in action which makes sense to me and then I discover that I have to build back of that

25:00.860 --> 25:05.540
to explain how everybody got into the situation that I visualized at the beginning.

25:09.140 --> 25:15.560
Okay, I think I know the answer to this or I could suspect it but I'm going to ask it anyhow.

25:15.980 --> 25:23.280
When you set up an alien culture, the terms, the language that you make up for,

25:23.380 --> 25:27.060
for instance in The Hunter of Worlds I think you did it more extensively there than most other places.

25:27.680 --> 25:35.260
Are you using any kind of language structure or any kind of languages as a background for that

25:35.260 --> 25:39.140
or is it just your own knowledge of linguistics that allows you to make that up?

25:39.420 --> 25:44.280
I consciously, I try to make it easy on the reader.

25:45.080 --> 25:49.120
Some readers I suppose may deny this but I truly do.

25:50.400 --> 26:03.840
I will for instance try to keep related words at least resembling one another closely enough that a person can figure out

26:03.840 --> 26:11.480
well this is something to do with say love or fight having seen a similar configuration before

26:11.480 --> 26:18.220
and if they miss it a little bit in terms of saying romance versus combat or something like that

26:19.120 --> 26:19.380
in the park.

26:21.440 --> 26:28.000
I do try to be kind also in not having words which aren't related starting with the same letter

26:28.000 --> 26:32.740
so I do some things which are designed for kindness to the reader.

26:35.220 --> 26:40.920
Likewise when I'm dealing with alien names I try to avoid having two or three aliens with very similar names

26:43.480 --> 26:49.180
which can be very very confusing because there are many people who do not read phonetically

26:49.440 --> 26:54.500
and this could be a problem to them so I'll try to have them start at different points of the alphabet.

26:56.960 --> 27:06.100
Hunter of Worlds is constructed for different reasons usually when I use alien languages in a book.

27:06.100 --> 27:14.820
It is not for local color it's just that when you run across anybody's civilization which is vastly different than your own

27:14.820 --> 27:20.700
you're going to come across three or four words which cannot be translated no matter how you would like to.

27:21.560 --> 27:27.300
It's just that not all languages have words for concepts.

27:29.800 --> 27:36.680
Well you know like in English you can take several things that you can say that you can't say in French and vice versa

27:37.400 --> 27:42.780
which is why language borrow words from other languages.

27:43.420 --> 27:48.080
When I did Hunter of Worlds I was doing something totally different and it is an experimental novel

27:48.080 --> 27:54.260
and it is not a novel but I recommend it to someone who is not used to science fiction

27:54.260 --> 27:57.400
or not used to language one or the other.

27:58.500 --> 28:02.580
Basically on that one the very premise of the book is linguistics.

28:04.360 --> 28:14.300
Treating the science of linguistics as you will as seriously as you treat physics in a science fiction novel.

28:15.940 --> 28:21.520
I deliberately set out to make a language which is not based on any earthly model.

28:21.520 --> 28:32.860
I even changed the rules of grammar to something that as far as I know is not directly based on any grammatical system on the face of the earth.

28:34.580 --> 28:41.200
The thing is explained in an appendix in the back for people who wish to do this kind of thing.

28:43.580 --> 28:46.180
And there are several ways to read the book.

28:46.960 --> 28:52.940
The recommended one is as the viewpoint character sees it.

28:53.600 --> 28:57.780
Frankly the viewpoint character is confused as all get out most of the time.

28:58.140 --> 29:05.760
He doesn't understand so you can equally well appreciate the book simply by realizing that from his viewpoint

29:05.760 --> 29:10.480
a lot of these people are speaking things that he in no rise comprehends.

29:11.540 --> 29:17.920
The trouble with the book is that of course at several points he is vastly mistaken about what he thinks he understands.

29:19.560 --> 29:35.480
So the book does have some pitfalls in it for somebody who is accustomed to believing everything that the hero in a novel believes must ergo be the truth.

29:36.260 --> 29:45.680
Because he is very very frequently mistaken or very very frequently picks up a concept which is not the whole concept

29:45.680 --> 29:54.740
and gradually begins to arrive at an understanding of what's going on toward the end of the book.

29:54.860 --> 30:01.060
But I must warn everyone that even at the end he is somewhat mistaken.

30:03.300 --> 30:07.040
Yeah that book did take a little more thought I think in work than some of the others did.

30:09.060 --> 30:11.320
Let me change direction one more time.

30:13.900 --> 30:23.840
I don't know if you think about the I'm sure you think about these things but do you have a definition of science fiction?

30:25.200 --> 30:28.800
I think the best one that ever came up was Roger's The Last Me's definition.

30:29.100 --> 30:32.780
At least I believe it's his. I don't know from whom he may have gotten it.

30:33.340 --> 30:39.420
It's basically that if I ever discover a definition of science fiction I shall immediately attempt to violate it.

30:41.040 --> 30:47.660
Science fiction to me is a will always remain an experimental literature.

30:48.360 --> 30:58.520
It does not have rules except to try to adhere to science and to prove things as much as possible and to try to have your research well founded

30:59.430 --> 31:05.240
in at least the best possible understanding of what's going on that you can arrive at.

31:06.140 --> 31:13.680
To me science fiction is the same thing that the unknown writer of the Kilgamesh epic did.

31:14.900 --> 31:20.160
A voyage in search of the unknown this sort of literature.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.020
It's the oldest kind of literature in the world.

31:25.860 --> 31:36.460
Frankly I have you modern mainstream fiction as an aberration largely brought on by culture shock with the advent of the machine age.

31:37.960 --> 31:47.180
I think that it was sort of a reaction by a literary establishment that was not technologically educated

31:47.180 --> 31:52.500
and was in many instances not equipped to understand what was going on in the world.

31:53.860 --> 32:04.580
So they retreated into a rather unrealistic form of literature which really attempted to either ignore the transformation

32:04.580 --> 32:14.600
which was taking place in human society or having seen it or trying to deal with it could see no answer for it.

32:16.060 --> 32:32.960
So my view of science fiction is that it is the cultural mainstream of western literature and eastern literature as well in many forms.

32:33.840 --> 32:41.380
And that it's no different in spirit or in type than the old epics.

32:42.880 --> 32:51.100
Epics are essentially literature of migration and mankind is presently contemplating a rather large one.

32:53.400 --> 32:58.300
Could you tell me what you think draws people to science fiction? Why it's so popular?

32:58.300 --> 33:05.560
I think the same thing that is always drawn people to all of the aforementioned.

33:06.500 --> 33:14.040
It's curiosity. It's a wish to be in touch with one's environment, one's real environment.

33:16.760 --> 33:26.900
There are so many people who go through their daily lives concerned only with what happens in the office and what happens around them.

33:28.180 --> 33:49.840
And it's sort of like being locked in one cell if you never see beyond that nature and the universe have so much more to it than what you perceive if you limit your vision to your immediate time and your immediate place and your immediate circumstance.

33:54.420 --> 34:01.760
There's a certain nobility in ordinary daily affairs. I do not deny that.

34:02.440 --> 34:13.520
But I think that the real understanding of what actually goes on in those ordinary daily affairs only comes through a wider understanding of the universe as a whole.

34:13.520 --> 34:34.820
And this is what I think draws people to science fiction, to fantasy, to this whole vast realm of a romantical or positive way of looking at the universe which has been in the mainstream of thought since literature began.

34:37.340 --> 34:48.880
Okay, maybe you've answered this already. Maybe I'm just restating the question, but let me ask it anyhow. Do you think science fiction has a particular value for its readers?

34:50.060 --> 34:52.140
I could not hear the last part of that question.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.540
Would you say that science fiction had a particular value or is it a valuable thing for its readers?

34:59.580 --> 35:15.960
Yes, I would say that the value of science fiction is essentially the broadening of vision in time because we do not really concern ourselves only with the future.

35:17.180 --> 35:29.720
This is why fantasy, which deals with past ages, has been quite as comfortable in associating science fiction as it has.

35:30.900 --> 35:36.940
On the one hand, it should seem very strange to find fantasy readers and science fiction readers trading books.

35:37.600 --> 35:48.640
We think that we had nothing to say to each other, but in point of fact we have all the world to say to each other. We have all of human experience to say to each other.

35:49.200 --> 35:59.740
We have the long view, one sort of being the memory of mankind and the other being the hope and the aspiration of where we will go and what we will do.

36:00.620 --> 36:06.500
Two sides of the same coin are as they agree with part of the Great Now.

36:08.060 --> 36:16.240
It is a kind of literature that widens the experience beyond one's daily life.

36:17.520 --> 36:26.360
It shows us the true size of the Earth, the true size of the Universe, the true importance of our troubles.

36:28.180 --> 36:40.100
Both the size and complexity of them and sometimes the extreme simplicity of them, it gives us perspective in dealing with the world around us and with each other.

36:41.240 --> 36:50.260
It shows us that we have in many instances a good deal more in common than we do in difference.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.880
Okay, that's excellent. Thank you very much.

36:55.120 --> 36:58.780
I don't have very much more to ask you, just a couple more.

36:59.660 --> 37:00.960
Yeah, David.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.520
Are you drying out on us? Are you okay on that end?

37:05.240 --> 37:06.340
Yeah. Okay.

37:09.580 --> 37:14.380
I guess really sort of well, okay. It's sort of a two-prong question maybe.

37:14.380 --> 37:22.580
I wondered which of your books are the most popular in terms of sales, you know, your best sellers, and also maybe in terms of fan response.

37:24.860 --> 37:32.700
It's very difficult to judge this because I'm fairly young as a writer goes.

37:33.860 --> 37:40.220
My works have only been out now for what, six years, something like that.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.500
And sales figures are still coming in.

37:44.660 --> 37:48.300
So the only thing I can tell you is that the oldest books have sold the most.

37:49.780 --> 38:03.720
And there does seem, if you compare sales figures to be some acceleration in it, also there must be a remarkable number of people that having read one or are going for the others.

38:03.720 --> 38:13.720
I hope that this is the case because the sales figures seem to be remarkably similar in terms of...

38:17.040 --> 38:22.640
Well, there's been some books that I've noticed that have caught on a little more slowly, like Hunter.

38:23.320 --> 38:31.820
I think that perhaps it took a little bit of readers getting used to me before they were ready to deal with Underworld.

38:34.200 --> 38:39.640
But in general, I would say that these sales have been fairly well even.

38:40.500 --> 38:48.580
Or if they were not even, they tend to become more and more even.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.820
Which I think has also helped with the fact that all my books are in current issue.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.680
And if one likes one, one can find the others.

39:03.000 --> 39:11.460
So about the other, it's kind of curious, again, time plays a part in that.

39:12.200 --> 39:20.340
The more game books, the Gate Trilogy does attract a great deal of male response in AIL.

39:21.860 --> 39:28.240
In the sense that possibly because it is a finished story and there was a great deal of it,

39:28.300 --> 39:36.340
and possibly people spent a great deal of time with it, also the fact that I think fantasy people are great letter writers.

39:38.160 --> 39:45.720
I do get quite a lot of mail on that.

39:45.720 --> 39:49.120
It also seems to provoke Spanish art.

39:50.180 --> 40:01.260
I've seen a great number of very beautiful renditions of the characters from that book, which again may say something about what people's favorite may be.

40:03.940 --> 40:11.320
But then it's got a lot of things that are really nice to draw like horses and medieval armor and this sort of thing.

40:14.000 --> 40:24.120
I also get a great deal of mail about the fated sun trilogy and a great deal of interest in that one.

40:26.180 --> 40:28.340
So the two longer ones.
