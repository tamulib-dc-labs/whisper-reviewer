Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.540 --> 00:33.860
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.160
And here are your hosts.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.360
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.980
Howard Waldrop is a science fiction writer whose stories began appearing in the early

00:47.980 --> 00:51.000
1970s and he's written some remarkably good ones.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.780
His reputation as one of science fiction's finest short story writers is growing.

00:55.480 --> 01:00.620
Waldrop's The Ugly Chickens won a nebula award in 1981 and God's Hooks was a 1983 nebula

01:00.620 --> 01:01.340
finalist.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.140
I Cut the Mic is a 1983 Hugo finalist.

01:04.600 --> 01:08.580
Waldrop wrote for fanzines as a teenager but finally he was inspired to write science

01:08.580 --> 01:08.960
fiction.

01:09.460 --> 01:10.940
Here he tells us what inspired him.

01:11.640 --> 01:17.460
Well, actually, if you want to know, everybody has a story like this but I read Lynn Carter's

01:18.180 --> 01:23.860
Wizards of Lemuria and I said if he can get that published, I can write, I can get that,

01:24.040 --> 01:25.360
you know, I can get my stuff published.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.020
It's real obvious.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.540
I mean, everybody, I think, has a story about that.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.060
They read something after they've been reading this for 20 years.

01:32.540 --> 01:38.180
They finally read something that just pushes their buttons and says, that's garbage, you

01:38.180 --> 01:41.300
know, I can write better than that even when you're 18 years old.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.640
He said, I can write better than that.

01:42.840 --> 01:43.980
And you set out to prove it.

01:44.100 --> 01:48.520
And a lot of people set out to prove it, write a story and like submit it or don't submit

01:48.520 --> 01:50.000
it, just write the story to prove it.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.220
They can write a story, you know, not even writing a story.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.780
So essentially is I got serious.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.260
Walter was first professional sale was a story called Lunchbox.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.360
We asked him how he initially got published.

02:09.500 --> 02:14.180
Essentially, I had been trying to get published since 1966.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.680
Been serious about it, 65 and 66.

02:17.540 --> 02:20.980
And I'd been publishing in fanzines all along, stories in fanzines.

02:21.420 --> 02:25.580
And I just kept sending the stories out until finally one of them sold.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.800
I mean, there was no problem breaking in as such.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.860
I mean, it wasn't like a conscious thing saying, this is the one I'm going to break

02:32.860 --> 02:35.100
in with or I'm going to write a story to break in.

02:35.140 --> 02:38.700
It was just I'd been sending them out and getting them back until one day I sent one

02:38.700 --> 02:39.960
out and it didn't come back.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.700
You know, check came back.

02:43.400 --> 02:47.300
And that's, you know, it was like I'd been, I'd been writing for fanzines all along in

02:47.300 --> 02:48.660
comic scripts and things like that.

02:49.380 --> 02:53.620
And the story just came, I mean, when it was time for it to sell, it's old.

02:54.540 --> 02:58.800
Lunchbox details the fate of the first Viking lander shortly after it touches down on Mars

02:58.800 --> 03:03.740
since the story was written prior to the actual Viking landing, but was published after the

03:03.740 --> 03:04.580
landing took place.

03:04.980 --> 03:07.660
We ask Waldrop if any changes had to be made in the interim.

03:08.060 --> 03:13.500
I sold that story in 1969 or not in 69 and 70.

03:13.680 --> 03:18.040
And I sold it four days or I got the letter four days after I was drafted in the army.

03:18.660 --> 03:23.600
And but because John Kimmel, it was so analog because John Kimmel died in the meantime and

03:23.600 --> 03:29.800
everything was in and uproar at Street and Smith for about, or Condon asked for six months

03:29.800 --> 03:30.180
or so.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.660
Ben Bova wrote me a letter in 1972 and said, I'm changing all.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.400
The original it was called Voyager.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.160
If you remember the Viking, the Viking stuff was all called Voyager.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.540
And the whole story was talking about the Voyager lander and all this kind of stuff.

03:45.020 --> 03:49.620
And Ben Bova wrote and says, is it okay if I change, change Voyager to Viking so you

03:49.620 --> 03:50.380
won't look like a jerk?

03:50.600 --> 03:51.800
And I said, why sure, Ben?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.200
Yeah, you know, anything you want.

03:53.860 --> 03:58.440
And you know, because the technology changed the, the changed the term, you know, the terminology

03:58.440 --> 03:59.020
in the meantime.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.760
And, you know, I'd been in the army and what was that?

04:01.940 --> 04:06.820
You know, I was guarding PX's and stuff, you know, and you know, I hadn't been kept up

04:06.820 --> 04:10.280
on the change in terminology in the meantime, you know.

04:10.600 --> 04:16.280
But yes, it was, it preceded, there were, there were several prototype models of the,

04:16.360 --> 04:20.940
essentially what became the Viking lander all competing for, for the contract in the

04:20.940 --> 04:21.820
late 60s.

04:22.860 --> 04:25.240
And the Voyager thing was one of them.

04:25.460 --> 04:30.420
And I've got a, I've got a picture I visited Langley for one of the mock-ups of the, of

04:30.420 --> 04:36.640
the original Voyager thing, which was slightly, it looked much the same as the Viking eventually

04:36.640 --> 04:40.140
was, but had, you know, longer arm and all this kind of stuff, you know.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.980
But anyway, yeah, it, it preceded the program.

04:44.980 --> 04:50.620
So that's why, you know, the change to Viking was, you know, like, fitted into the story.

04:51.060 --> 04:52.780
More with Howard Walder up on our next show.

04:59.980 --> 05:04.620
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

05:04.620 --> 05:08.440
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:53.220 --> 05:57.140
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.960 --> 06:18.140
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.440
And here are your hosts.

06:27.020 --> 06:27.980
This is Daryl Lane.

06:28.100 --> 06:28.720
And Bill Vernon.

06:29.100 --> 06:32.760
Science fiction writer Howard Walder collaborated with several writers on short stories in the

06:32.760 --> 06:36.960
1970s, including Stephen Utley, Buddy Saunders, George Proctor, and George Martin.

06:37.420 --> 06:40.060
We asked Walder why these collaborations took place.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.600
There was a group of us, and we all, it's, it's, it's amazing that it happened.

06:46.320 --> 06:51.200
We're all from, we're all from Texas, living in Texas, and we all published our first story

06:51.200 --> 06:53.260
within like six or eight months of each other.

06:53.360 --> 06:53.900
It was amazing.

06:54.080 --> 06:54.940
It just happened that way.

06:55.380 --> 06:59.480
And we all got, got, got to meet each other at conventions within like six months of our

06:59.480 --> 07:00.560
first story is being published.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.000
And we were all writing at the same time.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.400
We were all serious about this stuff we were going to take over.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.160
And one of the ways we did it was we started collaborating with each other.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.360
And we'd do stories on our own, but then we'd also do stories that we couldn't do on our

07:16.360 --> 07:17.220
own with the other people.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.160
And it wasn't a conscious effort on anybody's part.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.040
I think it just, one of those things that just happened, you know, we were just all

07:24.040 --> 07:24.940
writing at the same time.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.100
We were all right there.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.020
Like Buddy was my landlord, you know, he owned one half a duplex.

07:29.020 --> 07:29.860
And I was any other.

07:30.460 --> 07:33.920
And he, of course, he got me into comics fandom 10 years before that anyway.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.580
And some of us were friends.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.480
Some of us met each other and became friends and things like that.

07:39.940 --> 07:46.040
And it's just that we just, we just sparked each other, you know, if you, if you had something

07:46.040 --> 07:49.360
you were doing and you got through with it and you weren't quite ready to do something

07:49.360 --> 07:54.760
else, you could always, you know, do a collaboration with Buddy or with, or with Proctor or with,

07:54.820 --> 07:57.040
you know, you know, anything like that.

07:57.040 --> 08:02.560
And like we just, there must have been in space of about two years, there must have

08:02.560 --> 08:08.820
been 35 or 40 stories come out of the various collaborations, you know, two and sometimes

08:08.820 --> 08:12.560
three way collaborations with people, you know, it was amazing.

08:12.780 --> 08:14.120
And it's amazing that it happened.

08:14.300 --> 08:17.960
And it's amazing that we got so much done on our own too, besides doing all that.

08:25.060 --> 08:29.640
One of these collaborations of voice and bitter weeping written with Buddy Saunders was expanded

08:29.640 --> 08:31.900
to a novel, the Texas-Israeli War, 1999.

08:32.660 --> 08:34.600
We asked Walter how this transformation occurred.

08:35.100 --> 08:39.900
We originally wrote that story before I sold Lunchbox even.

08:39.900 --> 08:46.720
Buddy and I did this 10,000 word novella or novel ad in alternate chapters.

08:47.520 --> 08:53.280
Like, you know, as, as in the novel, as in the first like 50 pages novel, we tried to sell

08:53.280 --> 08:56.360
that thing everywhere and it would not sell.

08:56.660 --> 09:01.500
I did, you know, it got up to the point where the battleship, the battle with the

09:01.500 --> 09:05.400
battleship or the cruiser in, in Dallas, that was where the thing ended.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.780
And it wouldn't sell anywhere.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.800
And I went in the army and Buddy quit trying to market it while I was in the army.

09:12.140 --> 09:17.060
Well, when I came out of the army and I started selling stories and all this stuff and everybody

09:17.060 --> 09:19.660
started selling stories, Buddy started writing again.

09:19.980 --> 09:24.680
He also took voice and bitter weeping, took all my parts out of it, in other words, half

09:24.680 --> 09:29.760
the story just by leaving the parts he'd written in and sold it first thing off to a galaxy.

09:31.060 --> 09:31.860
And OK.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.700
And then he sold it to Galaxy.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.640
Judy Lindell Ray was the assistant editor at Galaxy and had just been hired by

09:38.640 --> 09:40.380
Ballantyne Books as their SF editor.

09:40.800 --> 09:45.020
The last thing she saw before she left Galaxy was our story and she liked it and she wrote

09:45.020 --> 09:47.720
it and she said, I like this story a lot.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.360
Do you think you could come up with a, with an outline for a novel?

09:51.580 --> 09:53.680
And if you do, I'll offer you so much and so much.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.140
And we went, oh, wow, you know.

09:56.100 --> 10:00.380
So we said, not only do we have an outline, we sit down and like continue the outline

10:00.380 --> 10:02.420
as the book goes like in one night.

10:02.420 --> 10:06.520
So we said, not only do we have an outline, but the first 10,000 words are already written.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.460
You know, just like that.

10:08.580 --> 10:11.620
We just stuck my parts back in the alternate chapters back in.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.280
We had 10,000 words of the book already.

10:13.360 --> 10:16.300
All we had to do is write another 45,000 words, you know.

10:18.020 --> 10:21.120
And they wrote back, you know, they accepted the outline and gave us contract.

10:21.380 --> 10:22.760
And that was, you know, we wrote the book.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.620
That was, it was a stroke of luck.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.760
It was just a stroke of luck.

10:25.920 --> 10:30.000
We were, it was at the right place at the right time, you know, two, two weeks before or two

10:30.000 --> 10:31.980
weeks later, it wouldn't have, that wouldn't have happened probably.

10:32.420 --> 10:34.500
More with Howd Wald up on our next show.

10:41.400 --> 10:46.200
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

10:46.200 --> 10:50.020
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:32.420 --> 11:36.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:51.860 --> 11:57.160
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.420
And here are your hosts.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.820
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

12:08.060 --> 12:13.100
In 1976, a collaboration between Howard Waldrup and Stephen Utley produced the nebula finalist

12:13.100 --> 12:15.040
novelette, Custer's Last Jump.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.360
Custer's Last Jump is an immensely detailed alternate world story, which begins with the

12:19.360 --> 12:20.300
American Civil War.

12:20.740 --> 12:24.880
In this alternate history, both the Union and the Confederacy have airplanes, which figure

12:24.880 --> 12:25.820
heavily in the war.

12:26.200 --> 12:31.320
During the conflict, the Ogala Sioux leader, Crazy Horse, manages to acquire and secrete

12:31.320 --> 12:32.340
a few planes himself.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.780
In 1876, these planes are used in a climactic battle against Custer.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.860
Waldrup explains how the story was written.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.640
Utley had always been a Custer freak.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.060
He knew all about all that stuff.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.020
I'd always been an airplane freak, so I knew all about the airplane stuff.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.340
And we started one night in 1972.

12:52.820 --> 12:54.280
It was like November of 1972.

12:54.980 --> 12:58.240
We started playing, can you top this on a typewriter?

12:58.560 --> 12:58.820
You know?

12:58.820 --> 13:06.040
And so Utley wrote this section about part of the second part, the Collier's article.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.320
We're about two pages that, and he read it to me over the phone.

13:09.800 --> 13:14.000
And about an hour later, I rang him back up and read the first five, you know, first

13:14.000 --> 13:20.380
three pages of the part of the Smithsonian report about Crazy Horse's airplane.

13:20.780 --> 13:22.740
And we just went crazy from there, you know?

13:23.040 --> 13:26.900
And like the story was written in like six days or something like that.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.640
I did a tremendous amount of research in the time between the time we started the

13:31.640 --> 13:33.100
story and the time we finished it, you know?

13:33.560 --> 13:35.520
One of the things was it was written in the alternate.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.000
I wrote the airplane part.

13:38.380 --> 13:39.540
Utley wrote the Collier's article.

13:41.080 --> 13:45.860
Steve wrote the twain part because he'd always been fascinated by Mark Twain.

13:46.420 --> 13:52.660
And then I wrote the Testament of Black Man's Hand, you know, that twain transcribes

13:52.660 --> 13:53.300
in the story.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.560
And then we both sat down and wrote the bibliography together.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.240
You know, did all this stuff in the bibliography.

13:59.980 --> 14:04.620
And it came out, I think it took about a week to write the story, but it was because

14:04.620 --> 14:10.500
we both of us knew certain parts, you know, already had done research in certain areas

14:11.000 --> 14:16.380
that we could write the story and use the other research we did as we wrote it to finish it.

14:16.780 --> 14:20.720
But we did research, but we already had a lot of research, too.

14:31.540 --> 14:34.460
All of Waldrop's stories are characterized by a lot of details.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.860
This prompted us to ask Waldrop how much research he does prior to his writing a story.

14:39.580 --> 14:43.260
It's like everybody says, and I know it's true, I researched too much.

14:43.540 --> 14:44.880
I researched everything too much.

14:44.900 --> 14:50.440
Every story I write, I research a whole bunch and then don't use half of it, you know?

14:50.580 --> 14:52.260
Don't use a third of it, usually something like that.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.880
I like certain research that I want to do, but I don't want to do it.

14:57.380 --> 15:00.560
On my own when I'm not sure what I'm doing.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.560
So I read a whole lot about the whole subject.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.080
And a lot of that works its way back into the story.

15:08.560 --> 15:14.760
When I know exactly what I want to do in a story, then I get real specific and that research is not as much fun.

15:14.940 --> 15:19.740
You know, because you're saying I need to know exactly when or exactly what or something like that.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.280
You know, and that's nice because then you got to look.

15:21.660 --> 15:26.360
Whereas if you don't know anything, not anything, but you don't know much about the field, you can just go

15:26.360 --> 15:31.120
and get everything on it and just start going through it and reading it and coming across fan, you know,

15:31.160 --> 15:33.880
fascinating little nuggets and stuff like that to use, you know?

15:34.700 --> 15:36.380
But I do too much research.

15:36.780 --> 15:38.840
I do way too much research for every story.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.380
And it's like sometimes the research will take a month and the story will take two days.

15:45.000 --> 15:45.820
You know, it's...

15:46.300 --> 15:49.540
We asked Walter if he considers this extra research to be wasted effort.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.320
Well, it's never wasted.

15:52.480 --> 15:59.580
It's only wasteful in the sense that I could possibly be doing the next thing down the line

15:59.580 --> 16:02.280
while I'm still doing the research on one thing.

16:02.580 --> 16:04.680
You know, I could already be through with the story and have it.

16:05.200 --> 16:11.560
But I do the research and it just shows up in the story, you know, in the story.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.520
We'll have more with Howard Walter upon our next show.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:24.480 --> 16:27.060
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

16:27.060 --> 16:30.220
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.780
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:33.500 --> 17:38.780
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.100
And here are your hosts.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.440
This is Daryl Lane.

17:48.440 --> 17:53.520
The 1981 Nebula Award for Best Novelette went to Howard Waldrop's The Ugly Chickens.

17:53.700 --> 17:57.200
Waldrop has had several works which made the final ballot in the Nebula voting,

17:57.400 --> 17:59.440
but The Ugly Chickens is his first winner.

18:05.460 --> 18:12.200
I have not mixed feelings, but I had no idea when I wrote Ugly Chickens how good it was or not.

18:12.200 --> 18:18.100
I hadn't written a story for about six months when I wrote that.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.120
I was doing other stuff and I was working on research on other things,

18:22.320 --> 18:24.580
and I hadn't written an actual story.

18:24.700 --> 18:29.320
So when I finally wrote Ugly Chickens, I didn't know if it was any good or not.

18:29.740 --> 18:32.700
I really didn't. I couldn't tell anymore. It worked on it so long, you know.

18:33.100 --> 18:36.600
I did all this research for the thing, like I did six months of research for it.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.060
It's way too long for a story.

18:38.580 --> 18:41.660
And then I wrote the story and I didn't know if the story was any good or not.

18:41.660 --> 18:47.780
And then I sent it off to Terry and like the thing was that Terry at the time was taking a lot of medicine.

18:47.780 --> 18:52.100
He had a really he'd wrenched his back and he was taking a lot of medicine and reading for

18:52.100 --> 18:57.060
universe at the same time. Universe filled up and he said I'd like to take it,

18:57.060 --> 18:58.960
but universe is filled up and all this stuff.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.240
And I said okay and about that time, Marta Randall called.

19:02.500 --> 19:06.360
You know, I just heard from Terry about the story and I want it real bad and

19:06.360 --> 19:08.420
will you take twice as much money for it?

19:08.420 --> 19:12.440
You know, and I said oh sure, right? You know, so she ran down the hill and got the story from

19:12.440 --> 19:18.480
Terry and brought, you know, and sent me a contract and like two nights later, I walk in the house

19:18.480 --> 19:23.080
and it's 12, 30 at night and the phone rings and says Howard, this is Terry.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.300
I could just see dollars flying out the window.

19:26.540 --> 19:33.060
I knew exactly what was going to happen, you know, and like he had gotten off his medicine

19:33.060 --> 19:39.420
and one of the stories he had been promised wasn't delivered and the person said I can't do it,

19:39.460 --> 19:44.520
you know, and he wanted the story back real bad and like he was trying, you know, he was trying

19:44.520 --> 19:49.820
politely to get the story back for less money than Marta was going to pay me and all this kind of.

19:50.140 --> 20:03.040
Anyway, I had no idea whether at the time, whether the story was any good or it was just Marta and

20:03.040 --> 20:08.240
I always try to hope that the next story, a writer one down the line is going to be,

20:08.360 --> 20:16.400
going to be my best, you know, and there's just no, you know, I like ugly chickens.

20:16.620 --> 20:21.380
It still holds up, I think, real well, if that's what you mean. I went back and re-read it about

20:22.040 --> 20:26.980
three months ago and it was still a good story, which is all you can hope for because some of

20:26.980 --> 20:31.880
them aren't, you know, or not, not they're not good, it's that they're not, not like you remember

20:31.880 --> 20:37.080
them or wanted them to be. The final 1983 Nebula Ballot featured a Waldrop story,

20:37.320 --> 20:42.380
God's Hooks. It's based on the meeting between two monumental literary figures, Isaac Walton and

20:42.380 --> 20:47.420
John Bunyan. And it's amazing that nobody had stuck those together and because they did,

20:48.020 --> 20:54.560
any, any time you look at a survey of English literature, the two books that are unclassifiable,

20:54.880 --> 20:58.360
the only two unclassifiable books in other words are like biographies and there were like

20:58.360 --> 21:03.360
histories and there were beginnings of novels and there were poetry and plays and all that,

21:03.520 --> 21:08.420
but the only two unclassifiable books they talk about are, are, is Pilgrim's Progress and The

21:08.420 --> 21:14.860
Complete Angler. You know, those are two totally, totally, you know, classical books and they're

21:14.860 --> 21:20.880
not like any other books written that century or before since, you know. It amazed me that nobody,

21:21.140 --> 21:26.200
nobody had put the two together and the obvious way to put the two together was, you know,

21:26.200 --> 21:30.360
I'm gonna sit there one day and I said, I was doing research on Walton and Bunyan all

21:30.360 --> 21:35.640
of a sudden, Walton Fish is in the slew of the spine. You know, it's obvious, you know, right?

21:36.020 --> 21:41.000
You know, it's just, it's just totally obvious, you know, and it amazed me that nobody had done

21:41.000 --> 21:46.080
it before, especially a British writer, you know, especially a British writer. There were lots of

21:46.080 --> 21:51.780
people who were capable of doing that, you know, and nobody had done it and it, and it was amazing.

21:52.660 --> 21:54.420
More with Howard Walder upon our next show.

22:01.480 --> 22:06.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

22:06.840 --> 22:10.640
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:53.500 --> 22:57.700
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:13.300 --> 23:18.580
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.880
And here are your hosts.

23:27.280 --> 23:31.340
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. Hard Waldrop's story, Mary Margaret Roadgrater,

23:31.440 --> 23:36.920
was a nebula finalist short story in 1976. Centered in the desert southwest, Mary Margaret

23:36.920 --> 23:40.960
Roadgrater portrays a rather bleak future. Their protagonists are American Indians and they

23:40.960 --> 23:44.760
occasionally have get-togethers, which are highlighted by contests involving vehicles,

23:44.760 --> 23:46.780
something akin to tractor pulls.

23:50.540 --> 23:58.920
I'd always been fascinated with Indians and the Mary Margaret Roadgrater was another one of those

23:58.920 --> 24:04.680
stories like, no, no, no, worry, they're about three I've done. They just came to me in a flash.

24:05.060 --> 24:11.000
I mean, it was just, I've done research on Indians for years. I'd taken a course in college in American

24:14.260 --> 24:21.820
Indian literature and things like that. But the story itself just came in a flash one morning,

24:21.900 --> 24:30.000
early one morning, you know. And I wrote it like in a day, you know, the whole thing, beginning to

24:30.000 --> 24:36.160
end, you know, and I knew exactly like it came to me, the entire story. It's really amazing. It's

24:36.160 --> 24:40.560
really a rare thing and like writers usually have about in their whole career that happens about

24:40.560 --> 24:46.420
twice or three times, you know, and I've used up two of mine. I know, I know, you know, it's really

24:46.420 --> 24:52.320
nice when it happens. But just all the research I've done through the years just tumbled out,

24:52.400 --> 24:56.780
you know, while I was writing the story. Here he explains what made the story come to him.

24:57.200 --> 25:01.820
It was essentially, I guess, a lot of, you know, a lot of stuff had just been running around in my

25:01.820 --> 25:09.020
mind for months and months. And what triggered it was I got up early one morning, I was visiting a

25:09.020 --> 25:13.840
friend in Austin and sleeping on the couch and I got up and I put on Bridge Over Trouble Water by

25:13.840 --> 25:18.920
Simon and Garfunkel. In between the opening notes and like the end of the first verse, the whole

25:18.920 --> 25:25.160
story just went, you know, and I said, wow, you know, this is great. And I guess it was, I mean,

25:25.260 --> 25:31.700
if you go back and you, if you listen to Bridge Over Trouble Water and you read the story, there's

25:31.700 --> 25:36.640
no common element at all. It's just something in the, I guess, in the field or the mood of the song

25:36.640 --> 25:41.780
at the time that just brought all that out. 1983's Hugo Finals include a Waldrop story,

25:42.100 --> 25:45.520
Ike at the Mic, which appeared in Omni. This story has an interesting background.

25:46.340 --> 25:54.140
Mainly we're watching the Heroes of Rock and Roll, volume two or whatever it was. And they did a,

25:54.160 --> 26:01.320
like a 30 second bit at the end showing the two heroes of the 50s, which were Elvis Presley and

26:01.320 --> 26:06.160
Dwight David Eisenhower. And it just showed clips from both their lives, you know, right?

26:06.660 --> 26:14.620
And I said, wow, you know, a world where Ike is, Ike is the musician and Elvis is the politician,

26:14.840 --> 26:23.520
you know. And I tried to give the story to Chad Oliver and Lewis Shiner. They wanted to collaborate

26:23.520 --> 26:30.000
at the time. And I tried to give the story to them. I said, okay, because Chad's a jazz, jazz music,

26:30.000 --> 26:34.220
you know, fan has been from way back and Lou knows everything or is know about Presley. He wrote a

26:34.220 --> 26:38.780
book on Presley at one time. And I tried to just give them the idea. I said, look, Ike is a jazz

26:38.780 --> 26:44.580
musician. Presley is a politician. Come on, you know, do the story, send it off, make a lot of money.

26:44.760 --> 26:49.740
You know, right? And he said, we just can't get past the idea of Ike as a musician. You know,

26:49.760 --> 26:55.140
they just couldn't do it. They just couldn't force themselves. You know, I mean, Chad is too close to

26:55.140 --> 27:00.540
jazz, to desecrate it like that. And I guess Lou is too close to Presley to, you know,

27:01.340 --> 27:07.640
see the possibilities and, you know, in politics for Presley. But once they wouldn't take it,

27:07.720 --> 27:13.000
I said, well, hell, I'm going to have to write it myself, you know. So I sat down and wrote it,

27:13.240 --> 27:20.220
you know, it's like you, it's just one of those ideas that bothers you to write it, you know. I mean,

27:20.220 --> 27:25.520
and once, once I knew I had to write it, then I sat down and I did just enough research on Ike and

27:25.520 --> 27:30.840
just enough on Presley to know about how they would be probably about it and wrote the story.

27:31.480 --> 27:35.640
Howard Waldup's stories will certainly grace Hugo and Nebula ballots for many years to come.

27:43.620 --> 27:48.260
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

27:48.260 --> 27:52.060
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
