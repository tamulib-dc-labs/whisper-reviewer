00:09.420 --> 00:13.360
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:29.020 --> 00:34.340
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.840 --> 00:46.460
And here are your hosts. This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. Sooner or later a true science

00:46.460 --> 00:50.640
fiction fan has to attend a convention. Conventions range from the incredible Worldcon,

00:50.900 --> 00:53.660
a world science fiction convention with thousands of people in attendance,

00:54.060 --> 00:58.080
to small local gatherings with less than a hundred fans. And then there are the conventions in the

00:58.080 --> 01:01.940
middle, big enough to attract first rank authors and have a fascinating dealers room,

01:01.940 --> 01:05.600
but small enough to create a comfortable, intimate atmosphere between guests and fans.

01:06.200 --> 01:10.360
Such a convention is Aggicon, a yearly science fiction gathering held in College Station, Texas.

01:10.820 --> 01:15.560
Aggicon is organized and run by students at Texas A&M University. At the last Aggicon,

01:15.720 --> 01:20.580
number 14, held in the spring of 1983, we spoke with Gordon Lewis, the head of the Aggicon committee.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.540
We asked him to give us a little of the background behind Aggicon.

01:24.180 --> 01:30.060
Aggicon number one, so far as I know, was not originally called Aggicon. It was just called

01:30.060 --> 01:38.160
the Texas A&M science fiction convention or something to that effect. And they just decided

01:38.160 --> 01:43.780
it would be real fun to invite an author down and have a little miniature convention that lasted

01:43.780 --> 01:51.500
two days. And I think they showed three films. I saw a report on Aggicon 4. I think Aggicon 3 was

01:51.500 --> 01:56.640
the first one that was called Aggicon. I saw a report on number four. They took in a total of

01:56.640 --> 02:05.900
$800 and spent $400. And they had two guests and showed six films total. And that was about all

02:05.900 --> 02:11.660
the programming they had. And since then, we have moved onward and upward to better and better

02:11.660 --> 02:18.100
things to where this year we have 30 guests. We're showing eight major films at night. We have

02:18.740 --> 02:25.380
films running all day long. And we have the panels and the readings. And our budget this year is

02:25.380 --> 02:31.380
something like to take in $15,000 and to spend around $14,000 was what was budgeted.

02:48.720 --> 02:53.380
Putting on a major science fiction convention as Aggicon certainly is takes a good deal of work.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.360
The work is done by a committee on the Texas A&M campus called Cepheid Variable. We asked Lewis

02:58.360 --> 03:06.280
what the word Cepheid Variable meant. A Cepheid Variable is a pulsating star which there is one

03:06.280 --> 03:12.720
in the Cephas star system. And if you look at it, it will appear to grow brighter and dimmer and

03:12.720 --> 03:19.620
occasionally to change colors. And that's where we took our name from. What does Cepheid Variable

03:19.620 --> 03:26.320
actually do? Cepheid Variable is a science fiction and fantasy committee. It's out of the student

03:26.320 --> 03:32.860
programs office here on campus. And because we are a committee, we do programming through the

03:32.860 --> 03:39.460
student programs office. Some of the other clubs on campus do their own activities and programming

03:39.460 --> 03:44.620
just for their own members, but we program for the entire university as well as Aggicon,

03:44.860 --> 03:50.260
which is for people who aren't even members of the university. Is Aggicon the only responsibility

03:50.260 --> 03:56.020
of Cepheid Variable? That's our major reason for being. However, we also program all year long.

03:56.140 --> 04:01.420
We show science fiction fantasy films here on campus. And we are a meeting place for science

04:01.420 --> 04:08.000
fiction fantasy fans here on campus. Also, on occasion, we do send delegates to other conventions

04:08.840 --> 04:12.900
within the state as well as outside the state. Usually in the summertime though,

04:12.920 --> 04:18.080
because most of our students are busy during the fall and spring. Lewis says 95% of the

04:18.080 --> 04:23.660
members of Cepheid Variable are students at the university, but not all. We have a few who are

04:23.660 --> 04:30.260
not. Most of them are like we have one former student. We have one person who is laying out

04:30.260 --> 04:34.500
for a few semesters while he works. And that way he can become a Texas resident and not have to

04:34.500 --> 04:41.020
pay out of state tuition. And Becky Matthews, who is one of our guests, we kind of count her as a

04:41.020 --> 04:46.480
member of the convention committee because she was chairman of Aggicon 11 and has helped us

04:46.480 --> 04:51.100
with the roast program this year. Next time we'll talk with Gordon Lewis about the fascinating

04:51.100 --> 05:02.440
attractions Aggicon has to offer. This has been the science fiction radio show,

05:02.440 --> 05:07.060
production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa

05:07.060 --> 05:08.500
College in Odessa, Texas.

05:57.920 --> 06:01.820
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

06:17.540 --> 06:22.860
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:25.440 --> 06:35.000
And here are your hosts. This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Aggicon is one of the best known

06:35.000 --> 06:39.300
science fiction conventions in the Southwest. It's held each year on the campus of Texas A&M

06:39.300 --> 06:44.020
University and is organized by the students at the university. Gordon Lewis, the head of the

06:44.020 --> 06:48.160
committee which is responsible for Aggicon, tells us what Aggicon has to offer a science fiction

06:48.160 --> 06:53.240
fan. There of course are the movies. I believe they have movies that are just about every

06:53.240 --> 06:59.080
science fiction convention. We have the dealer's room which you can find just about anything and

06:59.080 --> 07:07.500
everything in there from books to weapons to posters and other kind of paraphernalia from movies

07:07.500 --> 07:14.660
and the world of fantasy. We have the artists and the authors. They sit on panels, some of the

07:14.660 --> 07:23.040
authors do readings for us. We had a NASA presentation yesterday. We have had one of those

07:23.040 --> 07:29.780
for the past three years and we consider that to be pretty regular at this convention. We're

07:29.780 --> 07:36.800
having a slide show this afternoon on Don Penchot's artwork and we try to have an art slide show,

07:37.080 --> 07:42.880
or at least we've been trying to for the past three years. We have the two movie companies

07:42.880 --> 07:48.860
that are here, Disney and Columbia Pictures that are promoting films and I believe that since I've

07:48.860 --> 07:55.140
been here at Aggicon 12 I believe we didn't have any movie promotions but at 11 and 13 and at this

07:55.140 --> 08:02.000
one we have had movie promotions. We have trivia quizzes. We have the amateur art contest. We have

08:02.000 --> 08:08.140
the art auction as well as other stuff that's auctioned off. This year we had the world premiere

08:08.140 --> 08:13.000
performance of Mr. Harry Harrison's play. That is a first as far as I know.

08:15.960 --> 08:21.020
We also have the pro art gallery where pro artists can display their work and the fans can come and

08:21.020 --> 08:28.480
look at it. We have an autograph session, a guest reception. Plus you can usually find the guests

08:28.480 --> 08:31.240
down in the party room if they're not doing anything else.

08:46.460 --> 08:51.520
The authors at this year's Aggicon, the 14th, would have interested any science fiction fan.

08:52.100 --> 08:56.440
Harry Harrison was the guest of honor and there was also a special guest, Stephen R. Donaldson.

08:56.440 --> 09:00.620
Harrison has written science fiction for a long time and is known for such works as the

09:00.620 --> 09:04.840
Death World books and for the stainless steel rat novels. And Donaldson is one of the hottest

09:04.840 --> 09:09.380
fantasy authors working today. His two Chronicles of Thomas Covenant series have sold in the millions.

09:09.980 --> 09:13.820
Lewis says that this year's Aggicon gave more emphasis to one aspect of science fiction and

09:13.820 --> 09:18.520
fantasy that many casual readers don't give much thought to. This year we have really tried to

09:18.520 --> 09:23.500
do more stuff for the artists than we ever have in the past. Usually we have like one panel,

09:23.500 --> 09:29.120
the amateur art contest, the auction and that's about it. And this year we've programmed two panels

09:29.120 --> 09:36.580
on art. We again have the auction and the contest. We have more judges for the contest this year than

09:36.580 --> 09:42.320
we've had in the past. The artist guest of honor was Michael Whelan who for the past two years running

09:42.320 --> 09:45.620
has been given the Nebula Award as the best science fiction fantasy artist of the year.

09:46.060 --> 09:50.360
Anyone who reads science fiction has seen Whelan's work. His paintings are found on the covers of

09:50.360 --> 09:54.820
many science fiction and fantasy books. One of his latest creations was on the dust jacket of Arthur C.

09:55.060 --> 10:00.340
Clark's best-selling novel 2010 Odyssey 2. We asked Lewis how Aggicon compared with other

10:00.340 --> 10:05.860
science fiction conventions in Texas. Well we have been billed as the largest annual science

10:05.860 --> 10:12.860
fiction conventions so far as attendance is concerned. Overall I do believe that we have a

10:12.860 --> 10:18.600
larger attendance if you count both the one day passes as well as the full convention passes than

10:18.600 --> 10:23.540
what other science fiction conventions have. A lot of that is probably due to the students here on

10:23.540 --> 10:31.480
campus but we do bring in quite a few outside individuals. For instance this year we had

10:32.280 --> 10:37.180
60 non-student convention passes for the full convention that were sold in advance.

10:37.900 --> 10:42.680
That means before March 1st. We'll conclude our conversation with Gordon Lewis on our next show.

10:49.880 --> 10:54.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

10:54.720 --> 10:58.540
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.520
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show so stay with us.

12:07.260 --> 12:12.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.860
And here are your hosts.

12:21.060 --> 12:24.460
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. We are talking with Gordon Lewis,

12:24.760 --> 12:28.160
head of the Texas A&M Student Committee which put on this year's successful Aggicon.

12:28.700 --> 12:33.060
And this year's Aggicon the 14th has to be considered a success. The guest of honor was

12:33.060 --> 12:37.300
science fiction author Harry Harrison making one of his occasional trips to the United States from

12:37.300 --> 12:41.540
his home in Ireland. The special guest of honor was Stephen R. Donaldson, probably no fantasy

12:41.540 --> 12:45.860
author since Tolkien has sold more books than Donaldson has. His chronicles of Thomas Covenant

12:45.860 --> 12:50.540
one and two have sold in the millions. The activities at Aggicon 14 were numerous and

12:50.540 --> 12:54.780
fascinating. Fans could mingle with the authors and ask questions about their work for one thing

12:54.780 --> 12:58.020
and this opportunity would have to be the heart of any science fiction convention.

12:58.700 --> 13:04.560
But there was also a well-stocked dealer's room, movies 24 hours a day, panels, art shows, a masquerade,

13:04.960 --> 13:08.780
in other words an activity to give a fan a complete immersion in science fiction for almost

13:08.780 --> 13:13.100
four full days. We asked Gordon Lewis how they went about getting authors to be guests of Aggicon.

13:14.220 --> 13:19.000
Well usually what we like to do is there are some authors here in Texas as well as some artists

13:19.580 --> 13:23.240
who are kind of like traditionalists at Aggicon. They've been coming for several years.

13:23.960 --> 13:28.040
We try and invite all of them and usually most of them will come come down here.

13:29.040 --> 13:35.740
So far as our major guests we have the guest of honor and we have a special guest. This year

13:35.740 --> 13:40.040
we were going to have co-guests of honor. We were going to have Anne McCaffrey as well as Harry

13:40.040 --> 13:48.860
Harrison but Anne had to back out because of medical problems. Harry Harrison was then left as our

13:48.860 --> 13:53.540
only guest of honor which in the past we've only had one. We have our special guest like I said

13:53.540 --> 14:01.240
we have a toast master. This year is Dr. Chad Oliver from the University of Texas and he will

14:01.240 --> 14:06.240
be presenting a program at the banquet this evening. He said he'd give us 15 minutes of

14:06.240 --> 14:11.580
wit and humor. Chad Oliver has been writing science fiction for over 30 years and has been a regular

14:11.580 --> 14:16.300
feature at Aggicon. Some of the other local authors attending Aggicon 14 were Howard Waldrop,

14:16.620 --> 14:21.240
Lee Kennedy, Ardeth Mehar and George Proctor. The out-of-state writers included Ed Bryant and

14:21.240 --> 14:27.100
Bob Varterman. We asked Lewis what the biggest problem in planning Aggicon was. The fact that

14:27.100 --> 14:33.640
all of the officers are students and we all have our homework here from the University plus all

14:33.640 --> 14:39.340
of the paperwork that is required. And I think the only reason that was a real problem at this

14:39.340 --> 14:55.980
convention was because none of the paperwork was done when I took over in mid-October. I ended

14:55.980 --> 15:03.360
up in the middle of a school. Aggicon is put together by student committee at Texas A&M University

15:03.360 --> 15:07.200
known as Cepheid Variable. We wondered if the students joined the committee because they were

15:07.200 --> 15:13.980
serious science fiction fans are just for social reasons. Both really. The majority of the people

15:13.980 --> 15:19.080
in there are really interested in science fiction. I myself am very interested in science fiction and

15:19.080 --> 15:26.960
fantasy and it is a pretty nice social atmosphere also. The majority of the people in the committee

15:26.960 --> 15:32.280
are real good friends and we get along real well. How many students from Cepheid Variable work on

15:32.280 --> 15:39.800
the convention? We have our member right 16 officers, eight of those have assistants and we

15:39.800 --> 15:46.360
have probably 10 of what we termed gophers which means general officer for everything ridiculous.

15:47.540 --> 15:51.060
Basically they are the peons in your organization that go and do everything

15:51.640 --> 15:58.460
that the rest of us don't have time for. And then so far as workers at the convention, just general

15:58.460 --> 16:04.600
people, committee members that worked are probably another 10 to 20 of those. Lewis says the experience

16:04.600 --> 16:10.580
of putting on Aggicon is worthwhile but I would say that no one should criticize the way a science

16:10.580 --> 16:16.640
fiction fantasy convention is run until they've been on my end of the deal. Because until you have

16:16.640 --> 16:20.920
tried to set one of these things up you really don't have any understanding as to what it takes to do

16:20.920 --> 16:29.080
so. All of the paperwork and all of the correspondence that has to be done. It really is a very big job

16:29.080 --> 16:32.380
and I'm sure that this year I could not have done it without the help of all my officers.

16:38.760 --> 16:44.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:44.140 --> 16:47.960
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:38.940 --> 17:43.060
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show so stay with us.

17:58.780 --> 18:04.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:06.740 --> 18:08.400
And here are your hosts.

18:13.060 --> 18:17.340
This is Daryl Ayn and David Carson. The Science Fiction of Dean Ayn is always exciting and fast

18:17.340 --> 18:22.720
paced, making it difficult for readers to put his books down. But his work also has messages to it,

18:22.900 --> 18:26.880
some information, some opinions that Ayn wishes to communicate through the entertaining and exciting

18:26.880 --> 18:31.940
narrative. Anasazi, systemic shock, and soft targets are all good examples of exciting science

18:31.940 --> 18:36.740
fiction novels by Ayn which carry some messages or information along with the story. Ayn bases his

18:36.740 --> 18:40.940
writing on ideas which he's interested in at the time he writes. He tells us about some of his

18:40.940 --> 18:46.180
interests. There are a couple of themes that have occupied me a lot.

18:48.640 --> 18:57.040
One of them other people have begun to come up to, begun to work on such that I can move on to

18:57.040 --> 19:04.320
something else again, I would say that sensible transportation, mass transit, cars that get

19:04.320 --> 19:09.120
50 to 100 miles a gallon, things like that, things that I was demonstrating working on,

19:09.120 --> 19:15.860
building cars that got 50 miles a gallon 20 years ago when nobody else cared. Now a lot of people care

19:16.560 --> 19:21.860
and now I'm not interested in it much anymore because it's already been, not because of me

19:21.860 --> 19:29.760
really, but for whatever reason it has been taken up as an important issue. The second thing

19:30.560 --> 19:37.600
along that line would be survival. Not only nuclear survival but various other kinds. I write in

19:37.600 --> 19:47.700
survival publications. I design backpackers wood stoves and all kinds of other gadgetry

19:48.920 --> 19:56.400
that would be very useful in survival contexts. I've had to make my own snowshoes to get out of

19:56.400 --> 20:04.420
the high Sierra on one particular summer, which was hardly like a summer at all. It was a very

20:04.420 --> 20:14.240
late spring, but survival in particular in the nuclear holocaust survival issue is one that I

20:14.240 --> 20:16.900
have dealt with for two or three years now.

20:26.060 --> 20:29.860
Inge's latest book is a good example of his method of writing about his immediate concerns.

20:29.860 --> 20:32.660
It's called Pulling Through and it's based on the theme of survival.

21:03.400 --> 21:08.180
Inge says he normally tries to proportion his stories between 90% entertainment and 10%

21:08.180 --> 21:11.320
information, but pulling through is a slight departure from that formula.

21:29.860 --> 21:38.480
In the context of a great big overbearing and overwhelming bounty hunter in California,

21:39.120 --> 21:46.060
the kind of guy who goes around with weapons all the time and has a fairly high tech environment,

21:46.440 --> 21:51.060
he's a man around whom things just happen and they happen fast.

22:12.260 --> 22:16.740
Pulling Through is definitely not a dull novel. It's a fresh experiment in science fiction and one that will

22:16.740 --> 22:20.900
fascinate readers. We hope Inge continues to include information in his books along with the

22:20.900 --> 22:23.580
narrative. That's really what science fiction is all about anyhow.

22:30.900 --> 22:35.600

And here are your hosts.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.680
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

24:06.040 --> 24:09.180
Donald A. Walheim has been involved in science fiction for over half a century.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.860
His influence has been and still is considerable.

24:12.320 --> 24:16.340
He was one of the original fans back in the 30s and helped start the famous science fiction group

24:16.340 --> 24:20.920
The Futurians in New York in the late 1930s. He's written numerous novels and short stories.

24:21.380 --> 24:25.500
He's been an editor of science fiction for 40 years and was responsible for the creation of

24:25.500 --> 24:29.120
the Ace Science Fiction Line. And today he's head of Dawes Science Fiction books,

24:29.340 --> 24:33.720
the publishing house he founded in 1972. Obviously, Walheim knows science fiction

24:33.720 --> 24:38.140
inside and out. We asked him to comment on science fiction as a separate category of literature.

24:38.660 --> 24:42.240
Isn't that distinction between science fiction and other fiction, particularly mainstream,

24:42.680 --> 24:45.060
really an artificial one maintained by the publishing industry?

24:46.340 --> 24:54.580
Well, let me put it this way. It is an artificial category. All literature is literature.

24:55.500 --> 25:04.380
But for the purposes of marketing, it is necessary to mark out the different genres or categories

25:05.180 --> 25:11.500
of what you might call standard reading. This derives from the fact of the old days of the

25:11.500 --> 25:17.880
pulp magazine when a magazine was clearly marked a western or a detective magazine or a science

25:17.880 --> 25:23.440
fiction magazine. And because it knew that readers who bought that magazine knew what they were going

25:23.440 --> 25:31.880
to get, mainstream is a very varied product. It consists of a story, books of modern adventure,

25:32.100 --> 25:37.620
books of future life, books of past life, books of historical, just experimental work. It can be

25:37.620 --> 25:45.500
anything. And your reader of category literature, which is actually I think the vast majority,

25:46.260 --> 25:50.540
know what they want. What they want is similar to what they have been reading.

25:50.540 --> 25:58.340
But they don't really want to jump into something which is outside that which

25:58.340 --> 26:04.620
takes them into an escape. They are reading for escape readers. So you market science fiction

26:04.620 --> 26:09.600
because that's what they're looking for. You market a western if that's what they happen to like.

26:10.420 --> 26:15.020
If your western reader picks up something which is mainstream, he isn't going to like it. It doesn't

26:15.020 --> 26:22.200
give him what he's seeking. It's the same thing with romance novels. So you have to make it a

26:22.200 --> 26:28.640
category whether the writer is like it or not. This is good for marketing. If you go into any

26:28.640 --> 26:35.100
bookshop, a large pay-back bookshop, you'll see that they do this. They mark, they put it in

26:35.100 --> 26:40.720
separate areas. They market science fiction, they market romance because they know that people are

26:40.720 --> 26:48.140
coming looking for that type of literature. A science fiction novel published as a mainstream work

26:49.400 --> 26:54.220
unless it's marvelously good, a very well advertised, instead of being lost, it'll be forgotten, it

26:54.220 --> 26:59.540
won't even be seen. And it certainly won't be reviewed by the people who read science fiction.

26:59.780 --> 27:06.620
They will tell each other. So this is for your own protection, for the author's protection,

27:07.180 --> 27:11.460
and for very sound economic reasons you do have to list it as a category.

27:18.720 --> 27:23.220
Some people say that science fiction is treated as the second class form of literature by critics,

27:23.460 --> 27:27.920
that it's unfairly neglected because it is a category literature. We ask Walheim's opinion on

27:27.920 --> 27:39.580
the notion. Well, I am forced to agree with those people. The mainstream literature is in a sense

27:40.400 --> 27:47.400
regarded as the literature by, let's say, professors of English and by book critics.

27:48.660 --> 27:54.860
And things which are marked in a category style are looked down upon as hack writing.

27:55.780 --> 28:00.000
I see that happen, of course, living in New York. You see the New York Times book,

28:00.100 --> 28:02.620
which was probably one of the most snob-organized in the country,

28:03.360 --> 28:06.800
which they will never review science fiction books if they can help it.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.920
No matter what the critics think, if you like science fiction, you'll like what

28:10.920 --> 28:13.060
Donald A. Walheim's Dahl books puts out.

28:19.600 --> 28:24.960
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

28:24.960 --> 28:28.780
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
