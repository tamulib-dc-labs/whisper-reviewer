00:28.080 --> 00:33.440
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.020 --> 00:37.760
And here are your hosts.

00:42.440 --> 00:49.500
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. British-born author James P. Hogan has
gained a reputation as one of the premier writers of hard science fiction

00:49.500 --> 00:58.960
working today. He's published seven novels so far, including Inherit the Stars,
The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, Giants' Star, Thrice Upon a Time, The Two Faces of

00:58.960 --> 01:11.120
Tomorrow, and his latest, Voyage from Yesteryear. Hogan tells us how he became
an author. When I left school when I was 16 and wanted to be a writer then, I

01:11.120 --> 01:22.780
guess it was something that I always enjoyed doing as a kid at school. You know,
the essays and the story writing exercises you get. And when I left school, I

01:22.780 --> 01:34.900
told the world I was going to be a writer. And it seemed a good idea until
somebody said, well, with all the accumulated wisdom and experience of 16 years,

01:35.060 --> 01:43.960
what are you going to write about that the world is breathlessly waiting to
hear? And I hadn't thought about that, and the answer was not a lot. So I went

01:43.960 --> 01:56.700
away into engineering and electronics and computers and things like that for
something like 20 years. And I suppose the interest in writing probably never

01:56.700 --> 02:05.500
went away. For 20 years, Hogan worked as a systems designer for computers and
sold computers to scientists for use in their research. Associating with

02:05.500 --> 02:12.540
scientists as he did, Hogan was exposed to all sorts of current scientific
research, and he would make use of his scientific contacts when he began to

02:12.540 --> 02:24.100
write seriously. I made use of my customers pretty freely as consultants, which
was kind of handy. I found that I had customers who were brain surgeons and

02:24.100 --> 02:35.460
other customers who studied pieces of rock brought back from the Apollo missions
and other guys who were investigating machine intelligence. And just about any

02:35.460 --> 02:46.840
of the topics or the favorite themes of science fiction that you could pick out
of a hat, the chances were sort of not 10 to 1 I had a customer specializing in

02:46.840 --> 02:55.440
that field. And I just had to, if I needed some background information on a
particular topic, I could almost guarantee I had a phone number in my diary of a

02:55.440 --> 03:05.100
guy who could talk all day about it. And they loved doing it as well. I used to
call them and if they'd like to come and talk to you tomorrow. Well, we're a

03:05.100 --> 03:13.240
little busy, but what's it about? Oh, I need some help with the book I'm working
on. Well, why didn't you say so? What time do you want to show up? And they talk

03:13.240 --> 03:20.360
all day. I think this is one of the interesting

03:20.360 --> 03:33.940
sides of selling computers into this kind of area. You can imagine some of these
specialists, they talk to bacteria all day long or whatever, and they end up

03:33.940 --> 03:43.680
shut in the back rooms of universities. And maybe there are four people on the
planet they can talk to who understand their language. And sometimes they find

03:43.680 --> 03:57.180
it hard to believe that somebody from the world outside that has walked in off
the street is sincerely interested to sit down and talk to them and is curious.

03:57.460 --> 04:05.420
He wants to know what they're doing. He wants to have it explained. So, writing
about his experiences with scientists, Hogan found that he was a science fiction

04:05.420 --> 04:16.700
writer. I didn't particularly set out to be a science fiction writer. I suppose
I became one by accident. I just always wanted to write and started writing

04:16.700 --> 04:25.800
stories about the little bit of life that I'd had some personal experience of
and was told I was a science fiction writer. And I said, how's that? And they

04:25.800 --> 04:33.660
said, well, the publisher is publishing it under their science fiction imprint.
So, we guess you have to be. So, I said, okay. And it kind of started out like

04:33.660 --> 04:42.320
that. Hogan's books are scientifically accurate and highly realistic. He's been
called the man who put science back into science fiction. Next time, we'll talk

04:42.320 --> 04:44.060
to James P. Hogan about some of his novels.

04:51.440 --> 04:59.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

04:59.160 --> 04:59.920
Odessa, Texas.

05:40.580 --> 05:44.500
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:00.100 --> 06:05.420
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.740
And here are your hosts.

06:13.940 --> 06:22.140
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. James P. Hogan's 1977 science fiction
novel, Inherit the Stars, should be required reading for anyone who demands

06:22.140 --> 06:29.920
scientific accuracy in an exciting narrative. The book takes place some 50 years
in the future. A skeleton inside a space suit is found on the moon. That's

06:29.920 --> 06:38.080
interesting enough, but what follows is even more provocative. The skeleton is a
human one, and it's been on the moon for 50,000 years. The scientific unraveling

06:38.080 --> 06:48.200
of this mystery forms the basis of the novel. It's like a detective story, and
Hogan talks about the origins of the idea. 2001 was one of the factors that

06:48.200 --> 07:00.180
inspired me to write Inherit the Stars. I love the idea of something being
found, a mystery being uncovered in the course of lunar exploration that was

07:00.180 --> 07:13.320
sufficiently intriguing to motivate a lot of scientists into unraveling it. It
seemed a good opportunity to set the scientific detective story that I wanted to

07:13.320 --> 07:22.040
write. You know, okay, let's have the detective story, or the mystery that the
detectives are trying to solve, hinge around something that's turned up on the

07:22.040 --> 07:34.400
moon. Well, dead bodies are always pretty good for detective stories. It ought
to be a more interesting dead body than the standard detective thriller, so

07:34.400 --> 07:44.560
let's make it 50,000 years old and human, which raises the whole, opens up the
whole bag of worms. And let's just see how they unravel that. And I wanted the

07:44.560 --> 07:48.680
ending to be a

07:48.680 --> 07:59.160
bit of a twist, a bit of a surprise, but nevertheless plausible and rational
within the context of the story. I didn't want to bring in mystical agencies or

07:59.160 --> 08:04.000
strange

08:04.000 --> 08:13.220
laws of physics or anything like this to hold it together. The entire scientific
community of Earth starts to work on the baffling problem of the space-suited,

08:13.480 --> 08:21.620
50,000-year-old human skeleton, which they named Charlie. They soon find
remnants on the moon of Charlie's culture, a map of an unfamiliar planet, scraps

08:21.620 --> 08:29.780
of Charlie's diary in an unfamiliar language, and some technological artifacts.
With such clues, the scientists begin to piece together the incredible story of

08:29.780 --> 08:37.760
who Charlie was and why he was human. Hogan says the book sort of defines what
science is all about. It counters some of the distorted images of scientists

08:37.760 --> 08:47.060
Hogan has seen in fiction. Scientists were always eccentric and they wore odd
-colored shoes and they drew cabbages that ate people and they wanted to conquer

08:47.060 --> 08:59.100
the world or something. And there were these cute public impressions of
scientists of people who run down the street with no clothes on shouting Eureka!

09:01.400 --> 09:01.800
Or...

09:08.740 --> 09:18.360
You read phrases like, it came to him in a flash, and you read on, and what came
to him in a flash would have been enough to keep Einstein busy for the next 20

09:18.360 --> 09:32.400
years. And real science, you know, there are insights, there are strokes of
genius, but the overwhelming bulk of the work is done by a lot of unsung heroes,

09:32.580 --> 09:43.320
a lot of people doing nothing really dramatic or exciting, but just meticulously
sifting through details, collecting information for generations and for

09:43.320 --> 09:52.780
centuries, all different parts of the world. And it's really like putting
together a huge jigsaw puzzle, lots of people cutting out pieces and twisting

09:52.780 --> 10:00.380
them around. Every now and again, somebody will take a huge chunk in this corner
and see that it fits with a huge chunk down there, and that's a breakthrough.

10:00.780 --> 10:10.480
And so it goes on. And it really is a detective story. I think it's a far more
exciting one than most detective fiction. We strongly recommend you read Inherit

10:10.480 --> 10:18.020
the Stars to find out the solution to the mystery surrounding Charlie. Hogan
wrote two sequels to Inherit the Stars, and all three form a trilogy that

10:18.020 --> 10:22.800
presents an awesome view of man's origins. Next time, we'll talk with Hogan
about those other two books.

10:29.760 --> 10:37.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:37.580 --> 10:38.340
Odessa, Texas.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.400
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:43.200 --> 11:48.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.640
And here are your hosts.

11:57.520 --> 12:05.340
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. James P. Hogan's science fiction novel
Inherit the Stars was popular enough with readers to justify a sequel. Two of

12:05.340 --> 12:14.380
them, in fact. The first was entitled The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, and it was
published in 1978. Hogan explains why he wrote the book. When I wrote Inherit

12:14.380 --> 12:25.960
the Stars, I had three books in mind. I had a trilogy in mind. So I put the
hooks in... Although Inherit the Stars was a complete story in itself, you know,

12:25.960 --> 12:33.580
it didn't leave anything... It didn't leave the reader hanging. It told and...
It started and told and finished a story. Nevertheless, there were a couple of

12:33.580 --> 12:47.000
hooks in there that invited some questions, which sort of, as it were, paved the
way to a follow-up book. And my thinking at the time was, I'll go that far, but

12:47.000 --> 13:00.440
I won't write the second book until I have some feedback as to how the readers
liked the first one. And I got a lot of mail, and they all liked it, and a lot

13:00.440 --> 13:09.440
of them said in their letters, will there be a follow-up? They picked out the
hooks. So I wrote The Gentle Giants. The Gentle Giants, of the title, are a race

13:09.440 --> 13:17.040
of aliens that first turned up in Inherit the Stars. In that book, scientists
from Earth had discovered a wrecked spaceship on Ganymede, one of Jupiter's huge

13:17.040 --> 13:25.020
moons. And on it were the remains of prehistoric creatures from Earth, dinosaurs
and the like. In The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, humans meet some live

13:25.020 --> 13:32.640
Ganymeans who have returned to the solar system after a mishap in space kept
them away for some 25 million years due to time dilation. It turns out that the

13:32.640 --> 13:39.780
Ganymeans had been responsible for human evolution. They'd taken primitive
hominids from Earth 25 million years ago and moved them to a planet called

13:39.780 --> 13:47.920
Minerva. Minerva was then one of the inner planets of our solar system, but it
was destroyed in a tremendous war involving the human stock that had evolved

13:47.920 --> 13:55.240
from the Ganymean experiments. The second book ends with the Ganymeans
leaving the solar system in search of their own people, who migrated from

13:55.240 --> 14:05.600
Minerva millions of years before the war that destroyed the planet. Hogan says
readers wanted a third book. And they wanted another one, and I did have a

14:05.600 --> 14:14.940
trilogy in mind when I wrote it, and the third one in that series is now
written. It's called Giant Star, and it will be, it's a July title, so it should

14:14.940 --> 14:26.680
start to appear in the bookstores around June. It's the third and last. There
won't be any more in that series. So it ties up a few of the loose ends, tells

14:26.680 --> 14:27.480
another story,

14:31.500 --> 14:41.780
continues with the characters we met in the previous two books, both the
terrestrial and the alien characters, and introduces some new ones. And I don't

14:41.780 --> 14:45.960
think there can be a fourth one, because it really, I don't think there's any
more to be said. It wraps it all up.

14:51.280 --> 14:58.860
Giant Star was published in 1981, and as Hogan said, it wraps up all the
mysteries and loose ends raised in the first two books. And it presents an

14:58.860 --> 15:07.420
absolutely breathtaking concept of man's origins, explaining also where man gets
his curious nature, his aggressiveness, and his incredible instinct for

15:07.420 --> 15:18.340
survival. Hogan talks about the underlying purpose of the whole trilogy.
Basically, it was an attempt to depict science as it is, or at least as I

15:18.340 --> 15:29.800
perceive it. And at the same time, weave that into a story that people who were
non-scientists, non-specialists, would find stimulating and arousing

15:29.800 --> 15:43.760
for the curiosity, even if, you know, without trying to turn it into a 250-page
lab report or something like that. And stimulating the books certainly are. For

15:43.760 --> 15:51.420
sheer grandeur, the whole Minervan trilogy, as some have called it, is matched
by a few other works in the field of science fiction. Isaac Asimov's Foundation

15:51.420 --> 16:00.060
trilogy comes to mind as a comparison, as does all our stapled inside John.
James P. Hogan's Inherit the Stars, The Gentle Giants of Ganymede, and Giant

16:00.060 --> 16:03.780
Star. Contemporary science fiction has little to offer that's any better.

16:10.940 --> 16:18.760
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:18.760 --> 16:19.520
Odessa, Texas.

17:01.860 --> 17:07.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay
with us.

17:23.360 --> 17:28.560
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.880
And here are your hosts.

17:36.980 --> 17:45.080
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Time travel is one of the traditional
themes of science fiction. One of the best, certainly one of the most realistic

17:45.080 --> 17:53.580
time travel books, is James Hogan's Thrice Upon a Time, which came out in 1980.
But for some time, for a number of years, in fact, before I wrote Thrice Upon a

17:53.580 --> 18:05.360
Time, I'd been wanting to write a time travel book for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I wanted to attempt to face up to the paradoxes, the logical paradoxes,

18:05.520 --> 18:19.380
once and for all, and answer them without cop-outs, without convenient
coincidences, and without obliging characters who just happened to do the right

18:19.380 --> 18:22.480
thing to make everything come out the way the author said.

18:26.500 --> 18:37.620
And secondly, I wanted to get away from this kind of cliche of some kind of a
conjurer's box, described or disguised as whatever, that you jump into and you

18:37.620 --> 18:39.560
jump out of and you're in some other time.

18:59.680 --> 19:09.600
Hogan wanted to avoid some of the clichés or formulas that characterized most
time travel stories. I think in too many stories, time machines are used like

19:09.600 --> 19:19.580
starships. They're just a device, a vehicle, to get some characters into an
unusual environment and then tell a pretty routine story that was stolen from

19:19.580 --> 19:29.080
Greek mythology or European medieval history. And the technology doesn't come
into the story at all. They could have gone there on a Greyhound bus. I didn't

19:29.080 --> 19:41.560
want to do that. And so the story was about some physicists who had stumbled
upon this phenomenon and had realized that if what they were seeing meant what

19:41.560 --> 19:51.560
they thought it meant, it meant that they could actually inject information into
the past and change the past, with all the questions that implies.

19:55.000 --> 20:06.000
And proceeded to test this phenomenon and obtained some very, very strange
results. The strange thing the physicists learn is that they can send messages

20:06.000 --> 20:17.480
into the past, not far into the past, maybe just 10 minutes. I didn't want it to
be a million years or a billion years or some huge span of time where really

20:17.480 --> 20:25.400
nothing that you did could make any difference. How about a lab bench
experiment? 10 minutes. You can just send a little signal back to yourself 10

20:25.400 --> 20:35.060
minutes ago and change what you've already done. This is interesting. You're
hard up against the paradoxes now. You can't find a way around them or duck

20:35.060 --> 20:44.900
them. You've got to answer the question, what happens? The logic of it, the
whole situation becomes absolutely, it drives you to the point of insanity

20:44.900 --> 20:52.860
trying to figure it out. It was the logic and the science implied by the time
travel theme that fascinated Hogan. He wanted to approach the concept

20:52.860 --> 20:59.800
realistically. And it's so realistic that you feel, after reading the book, you
could go down to Radio Shack and buy the parts to make a time travel machine.

21:00.360 --> 21:07.960
Recently, a number of responsible scientists have been speculating on the actual
possibility of time travel. We asked Hogan if he thought it would ever be a

21:07.960 --> 21:18.100
reality and if his book was meant to be prophetic. Well, I don't know whether
it's prophetic or not. Well, as is elaborated in the book itself, if something

21:18.100 --> 21:28.780
like that ever became a fact, there are some pretty interesting problems that
are going to have to be solved. And our ideas of logic and cause and effect are

21:28.780 --> 21:38.600
going to have to undergo some pretty interesting revisions. So I'm certainly not
setting myself up as a prophet and saying, yes, it'll happen. Maybe, I don't

21:38.600 --> 21:48.500
know. I think history has shown that impossible or it'll never happen are very
dangerous phrases to use in any context. More with James P. Hogan next time.

21:55.580 --> 22:03.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:03.420 --> 22:04.160
Odessa, Texas.

22:49.820 --> 22:53.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:09.440 --> 23:14.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:17.380 --> 23:18.980
And here are your hosts.

23:23.120 --> 23:31.380
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. Of all science fiction writers working
today, no one surpasses James P. Hogan in scientific accuracy and realism.

23:31.380 --> 23:38.780
Hogan's publisher, Ballantyne Books, has advertised them as the man who put
science back in science fiction. And after reading books like Thrice Upon a Time

23:38.780 --> 23:45.760
and The Two Faces of Tomorrow, you realize how much he deserves that
description. Hogan is also concerned with realism, with the kind of everyday

23:45.760 --> 23:53.300
detail that makes his story, even though it's set in the future, a totally
believable one. He explains why realistic detail is important. I think these

23:53.300 --> 24:09.940
kinds of details do matter because if we're putting a story into a futuristic
setting, I think the little details of background, such as if the guy needs to

24:09.940 --> 24:20.020
make a phone tour, how does he go about it if he needs to rent a cab, these
matter because if the story is being told in the future, the whole of the

24:20.020 --> 24:33.080
background has to be consistently futuristic. I've come across a number of
instances which, in my opinion, are a little flawed because, spelt with an AW,

24:34.180 --> 24:47.900
that a writer may have seized on a particular thought, maybe a new scientific
idea or a machine or whatever, develops that very well, but kind of gets hung up

24:47.900 --> 24:52.980
on it and in the background, everything else that's going on hasn't changed
since 1980.

24:56.720 --> 25:04.260
And trying to, I think, just stop typing for the five minutes it takes just to
think about a situation. The guy's going to make a phone call, just like stop

25:04.260 --> 25:18.160
and think how he might make that and think about it for five minutes and then
maybe show it in a way different to what would have been the impulsive thing to

25:18.160 --> 25:19.640
do in the first couple of seconds.

25:28.260 --> 25:35.580
Hogan says that his readers appreciate his attention to realistic detail and
accuracy. In fact, he thinks he attracts some readers who don't normally read

25:35.580 --> 25:48.400
science fiction because of it. From the people who write to me and the people
that I meet, one of the gratifying things I observe in the readership that I

25:48.400 --> 25:59.880
have is that it is not confined to what might be termed a hardcore science
fiction reader who buys anything new that appears on the science fiction section

25:59.880 --> 26:11.580
of the bookstores. But a lot of, I suppose, people who might be termed younger
professional people in their late 20s, 30s, 40s, in all manner of professions,

26:11.580 --> 26:23.420
not necessarily to do with the sciences, teachers, lawyers, doctors, so forth,
who typically would say, gee, I used to read science fiction when I was at

26:23.420 --> 26:33.360
college or when I was at university, but I kind of grew out of it. I can't
relate to way out galaxies like years away anymore or aliens running around with

26:33.360 --> 26:45.340
ray guns. Today I have a family, a career, a mortgage, my feet are solidly on
the surface of this planet. But they seem to like stories that don't kind of try

26:45.340 --> 26:53.020
and take them to the other side of the universe a million years from now, but
maybe just stretch the future 20 or 30 years. And they find names in the book
