00:09.060 --> 00:13.000
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.260
And here are your hosts.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.380
This is Daryl Lane and David Cruz.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.640
Poole Anderson is one of a small group of science fiction authors who have written

00:47.640 --> 00:48.380
future histories.

00:48.820 --> 00:52.980
A future history is a group of stories or novels written along a consistent timeline

00:52.980 --> 00:53.620
in the future.

00:54.080 --> 00:58.820
Characters may or may not recur, but the intention is to speculate on the evolution of human

00:58.820 --> 01:00.680
society beyond the present day.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.120
Anderson actually has written two future histories.

01:03.380 --> 01:06.700
The first is not as best known, and it consists of only a dozen or so stories.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.440
Anderson began it in the late 1940s.

01:09.640 --> 01:21.060
But I started out originally rather early in my career and more or less inspired by

01:21.060 --> 01:35.640
the timeline's future history, and constructed one of my own with charts and background material

01:35.640 --> 01:37.420
and so on, like his.

01:37.700 --> 01:42.180
Of course mine was in mind, the events were different.

01:42.180 --> 01:56.460
But basically I wanted to do a similar job that is fictionally tell about the story of

01:56.460 --> 02:07.960
mankind from almost the present day up at least until the early year of expansion among

02:07.960 --> 02:08.680
the stars.

02:09.940 --> 02:16.440
This wasn't going to be the only thing I did by any means, or would write other things

02:16.440 --> 02:24.780
that were not in the series, but from time to time I'd add something to it, and I did

02:24.780 --> 02:25.580
over the years.

02:32.260 --> 02:37.620
Some of the stories in this future history are Wolf, Quixote in the Windmill, Cold Victory,

02:38.040 --> 02:39.640
and the Snows of Ganymede.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.640
The earliest stories in the series describe World War III, which Anderson had said in

02:43.640 --> 02:46.540
1958, a war that destroys modern civilization.

02:47.140 --> 02:49.700
But out of the war decades later rose a new civilization.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.740
It was a repressive one, dominated by the Psycho-Technic Institute, an organization

02:54.740 --> 02:59.600
which strictly plans and controls human progress through psychological manipulation.

03:00.240 --> 03:04.320
Anderson carefully traces out the social, political, and technological events which

03:04.320 --> 03:05.240
shaped the new society.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.780
He describes the colonization of Venus and Mars, for instance, the development of robotics

03:09.780 --> 03:13.440
and artificial regeneration, and the struggle toward a true world government.

03:14.100 --> 03:18.120
In one story, the troublemakers, he sends a space ark off to Alpha Centauri in a voyage

03:18.120 --> 03:19.800
that will take 123 years.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.020
But overall, things don't go smoothly.

03:22.460 --> 03:25.120
Anderson envisions society undergoing many upheavals.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.580
In Quixote in the Windmill, for instance, there are violent anti-robot riots, and in

03:29.580 --> 03:33.500
Cold Victory, a humanist revolution occurs which overthrows a psychotechnic institute.

03:33.500 --> 03:37.680
But some of the institute's people escape to Ganymede, the largest of Jupiter's moons,

03:37.820 --> 03:38.860
where they continue fighting.

03:39.460 --> 03:43.800
It isn't until the story break, the last one in this particular future history, that the

03:43.800 --> 03:45.140
institute is totally wiped out.

03:45.760 --> 03:49.660
At this point, around the 23rd century, the human race is ready to attempt interstellar

03:49.660 --> 03:50.360
colonization.

03:50.820 --> 03:52.980
Anderson leaves it there at the beginning of a new era.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.340
He explains why he added no more to it.

03:56.080 --> 04:04.160
But gradually, for a number of reasons, got less and less interested in continuing and

04:04.160 --> 04:07.120
started phasing it out, doing less and less of it.

04:08.070 --> 04:15.600
One reason for being less interested was that, as for the early part of it, reality was catching

04:15.600 --> 04:16.480
up with me.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.640
Anderson's second future history is much larger and better known.

04:44.640 --> 04:49.420
It includes some of the most memorable characters he's created, like Nicholas von Rhein and Dominic

04:49.420 --> 04:49.840
Flandry.

04:50.140 --> 04:52.540
We'll talk with Anderson about that series next time.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.980
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:03.980 --> 05:08.200
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:50.080 --> 05:54.040
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:09.720 --> 06:15.060
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:17.780 --> 06:19.380
And here are your hosts.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.080
This is David Cruz.

06:25.380 --> 06:25.980
And Daryl Lane.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.160
Poole Anderson has written one of the most ambitious and extensive future histories in

06:30.160 --> 06:30.800
science fiction.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.760
It's usually called the Future History of the Polysoteknic League, although a better term

06:34.760 --> 06:36.180
might be the League and Empire series.

06:36.540 --> 06:38.760
We asked Anderson how the future history got its start.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.420
Now that has a history much more like that of Topsy.

06:43.660 --> 06:44.340
It just grew.

06:46.380 --> 06:53.280
Originally I'd written a few stories about Nicholas von Rhein and I'd written a few stories

06:53.280 --> 06:57.400
about Dominic Flandry, who lived in completely different miliars, of course.

06:58.680 --> 07:07.360
And then one day on an impulse, I thought, well gosh, they could be on the same timeline,

07:07.360 --> 07:10.020
one living about 500 years after the other.

07:11.200 --> 07:18.680
And through an invention of that in one of the, once, one of the Flandry stories, and

07:18.680 --> 07:24.800
then started fitting in other stories wherever it was convenient.

07:25.340 --> 07:32.800
You see, the thing with the future history is that although each story should, of course,

07:34.000 --> 07:41.180
be readable independently of any others and comprehensible and so on, nevertheless,

07:41.560 --> 07:48.000
if you have a reader who remembers a number of them, the cross connections will add an

07:48.000 --> 07:51.700
extra dimension and thereby a hope at his enjoyment.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.480
So I started doing it that way.

07:59.640 --> 08:03.960
And after a while realized I had a rather large beast by the tail.

08:04.200 --> 08:14.920
If I was going to stay consistent at all, then I had to keep careful notes and I had to develop

08:14.920 --> 08:17.800
a systematic scheme and so on.

08:19.320 --> 08:27.240
And thus over the years one thing led to another until it all became rather elaborate by now

08:27.240 --> 08:38.580
and what includes, I think, something like 40 separate items of which probably at least

08:39.280 --> 08:42.960
a third or so are full dressed novels.

08:44.240 --> 08:48.160
The first story Nicholas Von Ryn turned up in was the novel The Man Who Counts,

08:48.240 --> 08:50.100
which was also issued as The War of the Wingman.

08:50.540 --> 08:52.460
Von Ryn is a nonheroic type.

08:52.460 --> 08:57.460
He's a fat, loudmouthed, cursing schemer who favors good food, drink and creature comforts.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.860
But using his wits he usually conquers all of his foes, human or alien.

09:02.480 --> 09:06.920
He establishes the Polysotectonic League, a trading guild which carries Earth culture throughout the stars.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.900
We asked Anderson if Von Ryn has been popular with readers.

09:10.740 --> 09:18.840
Oh yes, there are some readers who can't stand him but they don't ignore him either.

09:18.840 --> 09:27.360
And as for the rest, he probably is the most popular character I've ever come up with.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.640
Then about 500 years along the timeline of his future history,

09:31.960 --> 09:35.020
Anderson introduces Dominic Flandry, an agent for the Terran Empire.

09:35.440 --> 09:39.540
He turns up in books like Instant Flandry, The Rebel Worlds, Earthman Go Home,

09:39.880 --> 09:41.580
and A Night of Ghosts and Shadows.

09:42.180 --> 09:45.800
The Flandry stories are set in the 31st century and involve the Terran Empire's

09:45.800 --> 09:48.620
struggle with its powerful alien antagonist, the Merseans.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.780
Flandry is the opposite of Von Ryn.

09:51.060 --> 09:56.260
He's smooth, sophisticated, suave, a man who can either fight or scheme with equal style and flair.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.240
He reminds a reader of James Bond.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.760
We asked Anderson if the relationship was intentional.

10:01.660 --> 10:07.200
Oh no, no I've been asked this before and as a matter of fact the first Flandry story

10:07.200 --> 10:11.620
appeared something like 20 years before the first James Bond story did.

10:13.180 --> 10:19.380
If I was modeling on any other character at all, it would probably have had to be somebody like the scene.

10:20.540 --> 10:25.740
Anderson says he probably won't be adding any more to the future history of the Polysotectic League and the Terran Empire,

10:26.060 --> 10:30.420
but there's enough material there already to keep a science fiction reader busy for a long time.

10:30.820 --> 10:32.880
We'll have some more on Pool Anderson next time.

10:39.940 --> 10:45.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

10:45.460 --> 10:48.600
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:48.380 --> 11:53.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.000
And here are your hosts.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.520
This is Daryl Lane and David Cruz.

12:05.040 --> 12:08.220
A number of science fiction authors employ the technique of world building in their stories.

12:08.540 --> 12:11.780
Pool Anderson is one of the best at world building. He explains the term.

12:12.680 --> 12:27.560
The term simply refers to the construction of an imaginary world as a setting for a story in considerable detail.

12:29.300 --> 12:31.480
Now, lots of people have done this.

12:31.480 --> 12:43.020
This is an obvious example, for example, of what would be J.R.R. Tolkien in The Lord of the Rings and related stories.

12:43.760 --> 12:53.060
He constructs an imaginary world in vast detail, complete down to fine points of the various languages spoken and so on.

12:53.900 --> 12:59.620
Anderson's first extensive attempt at world building was the Planet Diomedes, which was a setting for his novel The Man Who Counts.

12:59.620 --> 13:03.920
He meticulously constructs the planet in detail that allows winged intelligent beings.

13:04.420 --> 13:09.080
The atmosphere, for example, is very heavy, which is necessary to support a large flying creature.

13:09.640 --> 13:13.980
Anderson explains why he spends so much time constructing his planets in consistent and careful detail.

13:13.980 --> 13:26.280
After all, we really cannot reasonably expect that any other planet anywhere in the universe will be very much like Earth.

13:27.180 --> 13:34.380
We'll probably be lucky if we find a few where humans can live without artificial help.

13:37.100 --> 13:50.520
And you're certainly not going to have native humans around there, or oak trees, or rabbits, or any other feature that we know here on Earth.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.860
That's just preposterous, I suppose, on the basis of everything we know about the evolution of life here on Earth.

14:03.520 --> 14:11.220
So, in that case, let's try to set up some of the features which are different.

14:12.940 --> 14:24.200
After all, one reason people read science fiction is precisely that they like to get away from the world around them once in a while and escape into something exotic.

14:24.200 --> 14:39.560
And in my opinion, to the extent that this exotic thing can be made at the same time realistic and convincing, the reader is getting his money's worth.

14:45.880 --> 14:52.440
Almost any world constructed by Anderson in his science fiction stories is put together with attention given to basic scientific laws.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.140
Anderson, after all, was a physics student in college and knows his science.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.260
Other authors, Hal Clement and Larry Niven, come to mind.

14:59.580 --> 15:01.000
Practice careful world-building, too.

15:01.640 --> 15:06.600
In fact, Clement says his science fiction novel challenges its readers to find any scientific errors committed by the author.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.980
Clement calls this The Game. Anderson elaborates on it.

15:09.980 --> 15:22.620
The game consists in an author setting up a world or a situation or something as the very best he can and writing a story about it.

15:24.440 --> 15:30.040
And then that's all he can do. He's made his move and that's it.

15:31.340 --> 15:42.800
And readers are free to thereafter to try to figure out from the story exactly what he had in mind and exactly where he may have gone wrong.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.560
So I've gotten some very interesting mail on technical points.

15:47.560 --> 15:58.880
And yes, sometimes they have indicated to me that I've goofed on this or that detail, but alright.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.520
I'm wondering from that, I don't mind.

16:02.380 --> 16:07.320
With Anderson and with other world builders, a reader gets a bonus to accompany an exciting narrative.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.880
Interesting and accurate science.

16:09.660 --> 16:11.660
More with Poole Anderson in our next show.

16:18.760 --> 16:24.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:24.460 --> 16:27.380
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.620
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:25.480 --> 17:30.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.980
And here are your hosts.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.840
This is David Cruz.

17:41.040 --> 17:41.600
And Daryl Lane.

17:41.960 --> 17:46.700
Poole Anderson is noted both as a master world builder and as a creator of believable aliens.

17:46.700 --> 17:52.260
He matches aliens to their planets with meticulous and loving care and with great concern for scientific accuracy.

17:52.760 --> 17:59.400
One of the best examples of his talents in this area is the race of winged creatures included in his future history of the Polysotechnic League.

18:00.100 --> 18:08.000
Actually, he constructed two separate races of winged beings, the Diomedians from the Nicholas Von Rhein novel The Man Who Counts and the Ythrians of the planet Avalon.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.600
Anderson explains how he got interested in intelligent beings with the ability to fly.

18:12.600 --> 18:23.680
All the way back when, many years ago, I mean many years ago, it's about 40 by now,

18:25.320 --> 18:32.320
Al Sprague the camp had published an article on intelligent non-human beings,

18:34.060 --> 18:45.100
where he used basic physical principles to demolish a number of notions, you know, like the idea of a giant insect and so on.

18:45.260 --> 18:46.480
It's just impossible.

18:46.760 --> 18:51.060
It would collapse under its own weight because it hasn't got the structure to support that weight.

18:51.060 --> 18:52.420
Things like that.

18:54.020 --> 19:19.200
And one thing he doubted was that you could have an intelligent being which flies because the wing loading that a living flyer can absorb is a take.

19:20.140 --> 19:25.380
It's so small that there just wouldn't be room for a sizable brain.

19:27.080 --> 19:30.800
Anderson thought about the camp's arguments and at last came to at least a partial solution.

19:31.900 --> 19:36.020
Well, science fiction writers tend to take this sort of a thing as a challenge.

19:37.780 --> 19:47.420
And so when I wrote The Man Who Counts quite a while ago, I did have winged intelligent beings,

19:47.420 --> 19:56.260
but I designed a planet such that it had a very dense atmosphere, which of course would make it easier to get about in the air.

19:58.580 --> 20:06.140
I also made them essentially six-limbed so that they could have not only wings but legs and hands.

20:07.960 --> 20:13.500
Well, afterward I got to thinking that had been kind of a cop-out. Couldn't there be some way to do it better?

20:13.500 --> 20:20.280
Could it conceivably be done on an earth-like planet? I couldn't see any way.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.080
The camp's arguments were there and they made sense.

20:26.740 --> 20:30.500
At this point, the famous science fiction editor, John W. Campbell, came to the rescue.

20:31.360 --> 20:37.760
Well, when it happened, the very last time I saw the late John W. Campbell,

20:40.000 --> 20:45.420
I was in New York and visited his office and we went out to lunch together.

20:46.840 --> 20:51.200
This was not long before his death. And we sat there talking.

20:52.540 --> 20:57.280
And during a conversation, Anderson brought up the problem of constructing a large intelligent creature who could fly.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.200
Campbell suggested a way to do it.

21:00.260 --> 21:11.320
And he immediately said, well, suppose it had some sort of light-driven supercharging bellows that would give a tremendous cursive ability.

21:14.160 --> 21:27.380
And I immediately saw that this was a way to power a winged animal, give it sufficient energy that it actually could fly in an atmosphere like our own.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.620
Although it might weigh as much as 100 tons.

21:33.440 --> 21:36.480
So on this hint, Anderson created the Ithrians of the planet Avalon.

21:37.180 --> 21:41.020
The people of the wind is probably the best known of his novels involving the Ithrians,

21:41.380 --> 21:45.280
but Anderson used them in a number of stories in his Polyceo-Technique League Future History.

21:46.140 --> 21:48.000
Next time, we'll have more with Poole Anderson.

21:54.660 --> 22:00.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:00.820 --> 22:03.720
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.780
The next episode will be about the science fiction radio show.

22:45.960 --> 22:46.940
Stay with us!

23:02.640 --> 23:07.940
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.260
And here are your hosts.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.660
This is Daryl Lane.

23:17.920 --> 23:18.580
And David Cruz.

23:19.120 --> 23:25.420
One of the present masters of science fiction and fantasy, an author whose work stretches back four decades into the golden age of science fiction, is Poole Anderson.

23:25.940 --> 23:30.900
It's hard to type Anderson. He's a full-time professional who writes all kinds of fantasy and science fiction.

23:31.320 --> 23:39.060
He's known as a writer of hard science, for example, which can be seen in novels like Tau Zero or The Man Who Counts, a fine example of world building.

23:39.060 --> 23:47.960
He's constructed two future histories. The best known one, the history of the Polysotectic League, contains some of his most famous characters and some of his most fascinating alien cultures.

23:48.780 --> 23:54.780
Some of the best of contemporary fantasy comes from his pen also, in novels like The Broken Sword and Three Hearts and Three Lions.

23:55.220 --> 24:02.860
And he sometimes writes tongue-in-cheek spooks, as in his novel The High Crusade, in which the medieval warriors with swords conquer a space-faring galactic civilization.

24:02.860 --> 24:11.280
Anderson has won numerous Nebula and Hugo awards for his fiction, and he served as president of the science fiction writers of America. He knows the field like few others do.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.560
We asked him if science fiction has changed in the years he's been writing it.

24:14.560 --> 24:36.840
Oh, yes, I've been a great many changes back around 1940 or so. Well, practically all you could get, unless you heart back to a few writers like Wells and Verne, practically all you could get was in a few pop magazines.

24:36.840 --> 24:52.400
And that means nowadays, of course, there's an overwhelming flood of it. It is not possible to read all which appears.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.200
Anderson thinks the image of science fiction has changed over the years.

24:56.200 --> 25:04.500
And also, of course, it's no longer disreputable. It's become quite respectable.

25:06.900 --> 25:21.020
You know, when I was your age, it was unthinkable that anybody could arrange a telephone interview with one of the writers of it under the auspices of a college for heaven's sake.

25:22.600 --> 25:35.080
But Lord, this was pop fiction. It was beyond the pale. Nowadays, it's been taught in college courses and all, you know, all this other stuff, you know.

26:02.080 --> 26:07.300
He believes that science fiction has had an important impact on the public, and he tells us why he thinks science fiction is valuable.

26:08.180 --> 26:20.140
Actually, all this is kind of trivial. I think the important thing is that the basic concepts have sort of permeated the public mind.

26:20.140 --> 26:36.920
And I think people are aware in that nowadays, in a way that they never used to be aware, that the future is going to be different from the past.

26:37.080 --> 26:44.940
It may be better, it may be worse, whatever, but it's going to be different and in very fundamental ways.

26:47.300 --> 26:51.820
And they tend to accept this, be prepared for it.

26:53.320 --> 27:07.660
I often say that perhaps the most important public service that science fiction is doing is by casting a certain glamour over science and technology.

27:07.660 --> 27:18.520
It recruits a lot of young people into these fields and heaven knows we need an awful lot of scientists and technologists.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.960
Anderson is still going strong today. You'll find his latest work at any bookstore.

27:29.720 --> 27:38.840
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

27:52.960 --> 28:00.620
Thank you.
