00:55.380 --> 01:03.840
This little paper recorder has been a big benefit through us and passing through
the time away and our transit out to the moon and it's uh rather hard to see it

01:03.840 --> 01:21.680
floating like this in uh in odyssey while it's playing the seems of 2001. april
13 1970 the mood could only be described as relaxed apollo 13 man's fifth lunar

01:21.680 --> 01:35.620

This is the crew of Apollo 13. Everybody there. Nice evening. We're about ready

01:35.620 --> 01:41.620
to close out our inspection of Aquarius and get back to a pleasant evening and
odyssey. Good night.

01:45.220 --> 01:54.540
13, we've got one more item for you. When you get a chance, we'd like you to
stir up your cryo tanks. In addition, have a shaft and trunnion for a look at

01:54.540 --> 01:57.740
the Comet Bennett if you need it. Okay. Standby.

02:00.560 --> 02:10.460
Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here. This is Houston. Say again, please.
Yes, sir. Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a main B bus undervolt. Roger.

02:10.540 --> 02:20.740
Main B undervolt. Okay, stand by, 13. We're looking at it. And we had a pretty
large bang associated with the caution and warning there. And as I recall, main

02:20.740 --> 02:29.840
B was the one that had an M spike on it once before. In the interim here, we're
starting to go ahead and brighten up the tunnel again.

02:32.660 --> 02:45.920
April 11, 1970, launch day. The crew of Apollo 13. Jim Lovell, commander and
veteran of three previous missions. He had orbited the Moon Christmas 1968 on

02:45.920 --> 03:00.240
Apollo 8. Fred Haise, his first time up, lunar module pilot. Jack Swigert
command module pilot three days ago he was on the backup crew now he replaced

03:00.240 --> 03:08.240
ken mattingly mattingly had been dropped from the mission because he had been
exposed to german measles he would watch the launch from houston's mission

right Roger, Booster. And go for staging, Capcom. Confirm and board out, flight.

04:18.800 --> 04:18.960
Roger.

04:22.540 --> 04:34.060
Staging, flight. Roger. Flight 5, our trajectory confirmed staging. Roger.
Flight, Booster, then board out, was way early. Okay. Flight confirmed, number 5

04:34.060 --> 04:42.800
engine down. Roger. Booster, you don't see any problem with that, though, do
you? Negative, not right now, flight. All the other engines are go. The next

04:42.800 --> 04:51.660
step in the routine of lunar flight was to burn out of Earth orbit toward the
moon. Then pull free of the third stage and dock with the lunar module,

04:52.020 --> 04:57.340
Aquarius. At the controls of the command module, Odyssey, Jax Waggart.

05:00.820 --> 05:13.260
We're hard dock, Houston. Roger, understand hard dock. Good deal. They pulled
Aquarius away from the Saturn third stage, the S-4B. Okay, I can, uh, I can see

05:13.260 --> 05:14.900
the S4B now at the hatch window.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.880
Odyssey and Aquarius moved away from Earth toward the moon.

05:31.280 --> 05:40.140
Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here. Fine guns. Go against. We've had a
hardware restart. I don't know what it wants. Houston, we've had a problem.

05:40.920 --> 05:51.860
We've had a main B bus undervolt. You see an AC bus undervolt guidance, or ECOM?
Negative flight. I believe the crew reported it. We've got a main B undervolt.

05:52.140 --> 06:03.600
We may have had an instrumentation problem flight, Roger. And we had a pretty
large bang associated with the caution and warning. The sensation I had was that

06:03.600 --> 06:13.920
I felt a vibration accompanying the bang, not a large vibration or shutter. Is
there any kind of leads we can give them? Are we looking at instrumentation? We

06:13.920 --> 06:24.540
got a real problem or what? We're reading zero N2 pressure in fuel cell 1 and 13
PSI on fuel cell 302 pressure. Okay, Barrett, what do you want to do? Open

06:24.540 --> 06:35.720
circuit fuel cell 1 and 3? That's for employment. Shut down the reactants valve,
and I ask for a reconfirmation since when you do that it's sort of irreversible.

06:35.720 --> 06:45.800
So if you shut one of these things down, they only can be restarted from ground
support equipment. Yeah. That's because they see and it looks to me looking at

06:45.800 --> 06:56.880
the hatch that we are venting something. We are venting something out into the
space. Okay. Let's everybody think of the kind of things we'd be venting. Do you

06:56.880 --> 07:05.840
see anything that looks abnormal in your system? Negative light. How about you,
EECOM? See anything with the instrumentation you've got that could be venting?

07:06.220 --> 07:15.200
That's a firm flight. Let me look at the system for you, if the venting is
concerned. Okay, let's start scanning. Here is a bulletin from ABC News. The

07:15.200 --> 07:23.900
Apollo 13 spacecraft has had a serious power supply malfunction that could cause
the lunar landing mission to be terminated early. I assume you've called in your

07:23.900 --> 07:30.220
backup e-comes? Flight, say again? Have you called in your backup e-comes now?
See if we can get some more brain power in this thing. We've got one here.

07:30.400 --> 07:38.140
Roger. At the moment, the astronauts are continuing to try to isolate their
trouble. A late report says the spacecraft now is operating on battery power

07:38.140 --> 07:48.980
alone. All unnecessary equipment is being turned off. Okay, now let's everybody
keep cool. We got LMs still attached. The LM spacecraft's good, so if we

07:48.980 --> 07:58.400
need to get back home, we got a LM to do a good portion of it with. Okay,
let's make sure that we don't do anything that's going to blow our CSM

07:58.400 --> 08:08.600
electrical power with the batteries. or that will cause us to lose the main or
the fuel cell number two. Okay, we want to keep the O2 and that kind of stuff

08:08.600 --> 08:16.800
working. We'd like to have RCS, but we've got the command module system, so
we're in good shape if we need to get home. Let's solve the problem, but let's

08:16.800 --> 08:28.480
not make it any worse by guessing. My concern was increasing all the time. It
went from, I wonder what this is going to do, to the landing, to I wonder if we

08:28.480 --> 08:38.420
can get back home again. Okay return. Okay, come. I'm coming back to you.
Flight. Go ahead. I think the best thing we can do right now is start a power

08:38.420 --> 08:47.700
down. Right about then it was quite apparent to me that it was just a question
of time that the command module was going to be dead. You don't want to get fuel

08:47.700 --> 08:57.500
cell pumped off, do you? We can do that on fuel cell number one flight. Okay,
well let's make sure we don't blow the whole mission. The thing that concerns me

08:57.500 --> 09:07.100
is throwing equipment. We had a problem. We don't know the cause of the problem.
Flight, I've got a feeling we've lost two fuel cells. I hate to put it that way,

09:07.180 --> 09:19.500
but I don't know why we've lost them. It doesn't all tag up. Network from Flight
Network. Bring me up another computer in the RTCC, will you? We've got one

09:19.500 --> 09:26.500
machine on the RTCC, and we've got dual CPs downstairs. Okay, I want another
machine up in the RTCC, and I want a bunch of guys capable of running D-logs

09:26.500 --> 09:34.940
down there. Roger that. What all this means is only speculation at this point.
First, though there has been some tumbling or rotation of the spacecraft, the

09:34.940 --> 09:44.720
astronauts do not appear to be in any immediate danger. I'll tell you what, GNC,
can you get somebody in the back room to try to figure out what the equivalent

09:44.720 --> 09:55.320
delta V is we're getting so that we can see if we can backtrack to see if we can
figure out what's vending? Roger, we'll give it a try, Flight. Okay. When I

09:55.320 --> 10:05.860
looked up and saw both, oxygen pressures one absolutely zero another one going
down it it dawned on me and I'm sure jack and spread about the same time that we

10:05.860 --> 10:19.200
were indeed in serious trouble the only way to survive the situation was to
transfer to the LM flighty com the pressure no two tank one is all the way

10:19.200 --> 10:28.480
down to 297 you better think about getting in the lamb or using the LM systems
I'd say this is as serious a situation as we have ever had in manned space

10:28.480 --> 10:38.000
flight. We've always called the LM a good lifeboat under those circumstances.
If at any time in the mission, however, the LM had separated and we had gotten

10:38.000 --> 10:49.940
ourselves into a rendezvous situation or the command module being around the
moon, then what you state is absolutely true. It would be a fatal situation.

10:50.920 --> 11:00.400
Telling me you're from flight? Go ahead, White. I want you to get some guys
figuring out minimum power in the land to sustain life. The accident had

11:00.400 --> 11:11.080
occurred 200,000 miles from Earth. Lovell, Swigert, and Haise rode in the lunar
module, attached to a lifeless command module. Apollo 13 had started as a

11:11.080 --> 11:24.300
mission of scientific exploration. It was now a matter of survival. Since the
command module was dead except for the oxygen and power hoarded for reentry the

11:24.300 --> 11:34.340
guidance platform of aquarius designed to land on and take off from the moon
would have to be used the first milestone and I consider this after the accident

11:34.340 --> 11:47.020
I guess more or less the survival now the first milestone was to get alignment
on the LM platform alignments are important you know because without knowing

11:47.020 --> 11:56.200
exactly which way the attitude of the spacecraft is in space, there's no way to
tell how to burn or how to use the engines of that spacecraft to get the proper

11:56.200 --> 12:07.480
trajectory to come home. In the position we are now in the Earth-Moon plane, we
have to go around the Moon to get back if we're going to use the Dips engine.

12:08.080 --> 12:18.920
You would have had enough capability with the SPS engine, but of course we don't
dare use that now. So we have to go to the back of the moon and come back. To

12:18.920 --> 12:26.280
get into the correct orbit around the moon, the crew had burned out of a
trajectory that would automatically bring them back to Earth. They would have to

12:26.280 --> 12:37.560
get back onto a safe course toward Earth. He needs to put his throttle to men
also, flight. Throttle to men? Yes, he's at 29% now, roughly. This maneuver

12:37.560 --> 12:46.480
again was completed on time. And because it was a manual burn, we had a three
-man operation. Jack would take care of the time. He'd tell us when to light off

12:46.480 --> 12:53.480
the engine, when to stop it. Fred handled the pitch maneuver, I handled the roll
maneuver, and I pushed the buttons to start and stop the engines.

13:03.500 --> 13:07.180
You go for the burn. 40%. Okay, Aquarius, you're looking good.

13:10.420 --> 13:21.700
Auto shutdown. The first problem was solved. They were back on the path to
Earth. But there were many other problems to be solved. From a building at

13:21.700 --> 13:33.180
Houston's Manned Spacecraft Center, systems experts coordinated the coast-to
-coast effort to get the crew back. One of the big problems was consumables.

13:33.780 --> 13:44.340
There would be enough to eat and drink. But in space, there are other factors.
Oxygen to breathe. Electrical power to keep the spacecraft alive. Water to cool

13:44.340 --> 13:53.800
the equipment and keep it operating. What we'll be doing until we get them back
on the water is concentrating on everything that their lives are dependent upon

13:53.800 --> 14:01.340
at the moment rather than worrying about the accident, because there's nothing
we can do about that now. It appears at the present time that everything is

14:01.340 --> 14:13.460
under control and that we have a safe situation at the moment. Hey, I want to
say you guys are doing real good work. So are you guys, Jack. We are about 70

14:13.460 --> 14:27.840
hours from home. And we think we have the situation in control. We've projected
the consumables, as I've described. And we have a plan for carrying out the rest

14:27.840 --> 14:39.540
of the mission. But there's going to be no relaxation at all, as far as that
goes, from now until Splash. There was a key decision to be made before Apollo

14:39.540 --> 14:49.800
13 went behind the moon. Where to bring them down. Their present course would
take them to the Indian Ocean, where recovery would be difficult. A burn to

14:49.800 --> 14:57.460
bring them home quicker would take them to the Pacific Ocean near the recovery
forces. Bringing them home even faster would place them in the South Atlantic,

14:57.780 --> 15:02.160
again away from recovery forces. It was decided to take them to the Pacific.

15:03.380 --> 15:26.640
We were in the simulators built in at the cape, and the contractors continuously, ever since last night,
We've tried to simulate virtually everything that we've had the crew do that's not normal, that they've done.

15:26.640 --> 15:32.000
And we've proven most everything that we've been able to run on the simulator prior to passing it up.
There may be

15:32.160 --> 15:41.200
some details we haven't done! But at least we've checked the feasibility of
everything we've done and we'll continue to do that. They passed 137 miles from

15:41.200 --> 15:51.040
the moon. For Lovell, it was the second time that he had seen the moon so near.
But there was no time for contemplation, there was another critical burn coming.

15:51.540 --> 16:03.760
Okay, let's get the camera spread away. Let's get off, that's the burn. We have
one can, Sal! and in Houston the newsman poured in to tell an anxious world the

16:03.760 --> 16:04.120
story

16:11.200 --> 16:21.360
shortly after Apollo 13 had separated from the Saturn third stage the stage had
been sent on to a trajectory toward the moon its impact would be recorded by the

16:21.360 --> 16:37.280
seismometer left by Apollo 12. By the way, Aquarius, we see the results now from
the 12 seismometer. Looks like your booster just hit the moon and it's rockin'

16:37.300 --> 16:48.800
it a little bit. Well, at least people have worked on this flight. I'm sure glad
we didn't have a LM impact too. Jim, you go for the burn. Go for the burn.

16:49.960 --> 17:01.760
Roger. Understand, go for the burn. Guidance okay? We're good, Flight. Control
okay? We're okay, Flight. Tell me. We're go, Flight. G.O. okay? We're good,

17:01.840 --> 17:13.540
Flight. Ground confirms ignition. well-calling, 40%. West Houston, you're
looking good. Roger.

17:17.280 --> 17:29.300
Shut down. Roger, shut down. I say that was a good burn. Roger, now we want to
power down as soon as possible. I understand. To conserve the electric power and

17:29.300 --> 17:40.540
cooling water, the crew shut down all but the vital, life-sustaining systems of
the LM. I think the LM spacecraft's in excellent shape, and I think it's fully

17:40.540 --> 17:49.840
capable of getting the crew back. I think, as we have found before, every time
we put the LM spacecraft to a test, it's always done much more than it was

17:49.840 --> 18:01.460
guaranteed to do, and I think this is a good case in point. Conserve the
consumables. Cooling water. Electric power. The LM water gun was leaking, and

18:01.460 --> 18:11.820
we shut that off. I guess it leaked about a quart of water, I would estimate.
But it took me about two days to get my feet dry, and of course I think you were

18:11.820 --> 18:19.440
all aware that the temperatures were going down in both vehicles, and it's made
for very chilly feet for a couple days.

18:19.500 --> 19:14.800
[Sound effects.]

19:14.840 --> 19:35.360
Lord, your astronauts will come back safe. If I may be serious for one moment
and ask the entire audience for a moment of prayer for the crewmen of the Apollo

19:35.360 --> 19:38.500
13. We'll hold silence for a moment, please.

19:38.550 --> 19:48.000
[Silence.]

19:48.080 --> 19:53.880
RCSA stands at 62% and B at 62%. Excellent.

19:57.040 --> 20:07.380
That's the reason we have gone a hell of a long time without any sleep. We have
to start thinking about getting people back to sleep again because I didn't get

20:07.380 --> 20:19.100
out of any sleep last night at all. Command module just slowly kept going down in temperature
until I think just prior to re-entry it was down to about 38 degrees. And along

20:19.100 --> 20:29.940
with that there was a sort of a chilling Coldness, the walls were perspiring the
windows were completely wet and it wasn't too healthy I recall that we went

20:29.940 --> 20:34.080
there to get some hot dogs one day and it was like going in with a freezer for
the food

20:45.720 --> 20:54.620
want my opinion on how they handled the situation when it happened, they handled
it exactly like we'd expect them to. They were about as well on top of it as

20:54.620 --> 21:02.080
anybody could be who knew what we knew, which isn't very much, I'll have to
admit, but I think they did everything right within the knowledge it was

21:02.080 --> 21:11.640
available to us in a timely fashion which is what all we expected of them I
think they did a beautiful job of it we actually had a third little sleep

21:11.640 --> 21:22.140
restraint which Fred does then put on and buttoned up and kept a little bit warm
the astronauts faced another problem their own exhaled breath the lithium

21:22.140 --> 21:31.920
hydroxide chemical to take carbon dioxide out of the air was not sufficient in
the lunar module they would have to adapt the canisters from the command module

21:31.920 --> 21:42.780
to fit the hoses in the limits on the ground an adapter was fashioned from
materials the crew had available in the LM cardboard from a checklist plastic

21:42.780 --> 21:55.340
bags and tape after check out in an environmental chamber the directions for
construction were sent up to aquarius at this point in time, I think the partial

21:55.340 --> 22:04.480
pressure of carbon dioxide was reading about 1500 millimeters and we constructed
two of these things and put them on a line and I think within an hour the

22:04.480 --> 22:17.420
partial pressure of CO2 was down to two tenths So you'll see that survival now
became one of initiative and ingenuity and it was one which the ground

22:17.420 --> 22:28.620
continually helped us along We had all kinds of people on the ground trying to
think of ways of extending our lifetime. There would be still another burn, a

22:28.620 --> 22:38.880
mid-course correction to get Apollo 13 into the narrow corridor through the
atmosphere for a safe return to Earth. Where'd burn attitude, flight? College.

22:41.720 --> 22:42.320
Ignition.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.080
The thrust looks good.

22:49.020 --> 22:59.480
shut down. Hang in there. It won't be long. There were moments when I didn't
know how much consumables we had, whether we could make it back or not. In a

22:59.480 --> 23:09.040
situation like that, there's only one thing you can do. You just keep going. And
you just keep thinking up where you can get more consumables. And so that's

23:09.040 --> 23:14.720
exactly what we did. On April 17th, they prepared for re-entry.

23:19.020 --> 23:33.480
After a small course correction burn, they jettisoned the damaged service
module. SSNP. Copy that. And there's one whole side of that big business. Is

23:33.480 --> 23:46.180
that right? The whole panel is blown out, almost from the base to the entrance.
Really a mess. Man, that's unbelievable. next they got back into odyssey to

23:46.180 --> 24:03.480
jettison aquarius prior to entry into the atmosphere okay copy that farewell
aquarius thank you okay los in uh a minute or a minute and a half uh an entry

24:03.480 --> 24:10.020
attitude we'd like omni charlie and welcome home. thank you.

24:10.050 --> 24:46.200
[Static.]

24:46.260 --> 24:48.400
how is Houston standing by? over.

24:51.500 --> 24:57.100
[Applause.]

24:57.100 --> 24:59.760
Houston, we see you... and it really looks great.

25:03.020 --> 25:18.660
Apollo 13. Apollo 13. This is recovery over...This is recovery and your chutes look good. 
Apollo 13. This is recovery. We

25:18.660 --> 25:49.960
observed your RCS burn. It's recovery Apollo 13 is descending. Apollo 13. This
is recovery over...

[Music and applause.]

26:55.380 --> 27:06.880
I recall, Captain, that when I spoke to you on the phone, you said that you
regretted that you were unable to complete your mission. I hereby declare that

27:06.880 --> 27:22.020
this was a successful mission. From the start, the exploration of space has been
hazardous adventure. The voyage of Apollo 13 dramatized its risks. The men of

27:22.020 --> 27:38.060
Apollo 13, by their poise and skill under the most intense kind of pressure,
epitomized the character that accepts danger and surmounts it. Theirs is the

27:38.060 --> 27:51.720
spirit that built America. Your mission served your country. It served to remind
us all of our proud heritage of a nation, to remind us that in this age of

27:51.720 --> 28:06.600
technicians and scientific marvels, that the individual still counts, that in a
crisis, the character of a man or of men will make the difference.

28:09.980 --> 28:24.940
GNC. Go. Surgeons. Go. Procedures. Go. AFD. Go. Network. Go. No. Computer
suit? No. Roger, that works. Give me an amber. RTC on FD conference. RTC is on

28:24.940 --> 28:28.020
FD conference. OK, all flight controllers, let's play it cool.

28:28.030 --> 29:43.000
