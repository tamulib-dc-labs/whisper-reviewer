00:01.955 --> 00:03.397
Ask you to explain what a pastiche is. Let me ask you the question, OK?

00:08.824 --> 00:13.991
Dr. Kreider, could you explain what a pastiche is and what problems come up with the Conan material in relation to one? Well, in the sense that we've been talking about it is where one writer takes a character and a world 
like the Hyborian Age created by another writer and writes new stories with the same character in the same setting. And he gets the full credit for the story, but the other writer has created the character and the

00:29.777 --> 00:37.526
historical setting. Also, DeKamp did something similar where he took incomplete Howard stories and changed them into Conan stories. which would be a pastiche of a slightly different kind, but it's the same 
principle operating. And I'm not aware of any particular problems that arose, except, of course, he would, by in doing this, he would have to ensure that the estate received part of his profits. Do you think that Conan

01:12.087 --> 01:22.165
is popular enough for Howard's work is so popular that perhaps we'll see an endless stream of books, past issues by all sorts of authors? It looks like. of people who have done or will be doing these. And I don't know 
whether we've mentioned this, but there is a planned Conan movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan. If this is a huge success, like Star Wars, let's say, that could give even more interest to this kind of thing. And

01:48.456 --> 01:54.362
we may see Howard going on forever with these past issues being I think it's possible that they would be continued because the original idea was to fill out Conan's life, you know, have his life completely covered by 
the past issues from, I don't know, boyhood, but certainly all of his adult life when he was an old King Conan. And it's already gone beyond that. They filled out his life and then they're going back to, you know, this

02:13.568 --> 02:17.551
stage of his life. He did such and such. So certainly they're not going to stop with what would be the chronological life of Conan. So the potential to go on beyond Is there you mentioned what we the fill in Conan's life. 
Where do we get information about Conan's life unless it's been written in stories? But what they did was start with what Howard had written in his stories, and say, if he were such and such an age in this story, and then a

02:32.125 --> 02:53.259
little bit later he was in this part of the country, and he called the Conqueror, it mentions when he was a pirate, back in his pirate days, and that's part of the way he solves the crime against the magical stone. So they 
would say, well, we'll write a passage about the pirate days. So that's what I mean when I say they filled out his life. That was the plan of Lancer Books and that's what DeKamp was trying to do. They were trying to arrange

03:07.164 --> 03:15.681
the books in chronological order and then DeKamp and others were writing these stories to fill in the gaps in his life. But if you look at the Lancer Books, I don't know how successful that was because they'll have One 
edition of it will say number four in the complete conan, and the next edition will say number five, and it'll be the same book. Well, originally, though, the explanation for that bill is that they issued them just,

03:27.420 --> 03:36.289
they numbered them by date of publication. The first one published was number one, the second one published, and then they came up with this idea of the chronological series and re-numbered them all. That explains 
that. In other words, in the author of the pastiche, would be attempting to remain true to the character of Conan, to what we know of his life, simply to fill in the details that Howard perhaps never got to. That's what I

03:59.095 --> 04:01.161
would expect now. It's true that maybe some of these writers have not necessarily been true to the character of Conan as developed by Howard. Of course, every writer thinks that he's the one who's doing the true Conan 
stories. The camp thinks his are the true Conan stories because he doesn't have the violence over. You know, he doesn't spend a lot of time describing the gore. even though it's there, and because he doesn't have a lot

04:24.817 --> 04:35.128
of sex in his, which Conan was practically asexual really, even though he had a queen. And a son, didn't he have a son too? This was in the past dishes, not when I was driving. But then Andrew Offit, I'm sure, thinks that 
his is the true Conan, but he has Conan rape a girl, which Robert E. Howard would have probably committed suicide earlier rather than write about rape. You know, this was not something that you would do. And often has

04:57.756 --> 05:01.520
done past issues of other Howard characters. Hasn't he done, I'm not sure, didn't he do Bran McMoron? He did. For Zebra Books.

05:12.592 --> 05:16.236
Could you tell us a little bit about this, uh, this Hiborian age? Was this a created world of Howard? Was it an actual time in history? It was a totally imaginary.

05:24.453 --> 05:28.261
I don't know if you can say it was totally imaginary, but it was not an actual age. It was a prehistoric age, so everything you imagine about it could be possible. That's why I argued that the stirrups were not really 
necessarily an anaphanism. Maybe they had them and then after. had they had to be rediscovered or something. But they have actually done a map in trying to trace out the places and they say it's amazing how well it fits

05:43.271 --> 05:49.740
over modern Europe. And so he kind of used a European landscape. Also, he has written a lot about how fascinated he was by the pics of this group of native to the island of Britain that would fight the Roman soldiers. and 
he certainly tried to use some of the idea of the picks and the barbarians fighting the invading Romans who represented civilization, but basically it is imaginary. Doesn't he also take in some of his stories, I think

06:21.027 --> 06:27.957
the King Cole series, back to the Atlantis or the Atlantean civilization? I think so. It would be the King Cole stories. I don't know whether those have been republished recently or not. I know Lancer did some of those, 
but I haven't seen any of those in so long. I'm not sure. How many Conan stories did he write that were published in his lifetime? Originals? Was it just a couple dozen? The only full length book was Conan the Conqueror.

06:53.142 --> 06:54.745
And of course it was done serially. But I would say probably not more than a dozen. Somehow I'd get the number 18. Okay, now that might be 18 counting the Conquerors. I mean counting Conan the Conqueror, serials, 
something like that. Published ones. Right.

07:11.693 --> 07:20.088
The brand Macmoren series, I think he was the one who dealt with the Celtic environment, the Celtic heroes.

07:20.268 --> 07:21.911
Did he publish those in Weird Tales also? I don't know. I'm sure this probably were though, or else? Where else would they fit? Yeah, okay, okay.

07:37.580 --> 07:42.504
We could, I'd like, before we, you know, we'd like to say some more specifics, if we can, a little bit about his work. I think we've probably got enough on his life, do you think? Okay, I'm gonna start talking maybe about 
the Conan heroes, just some general comments about his writing, try to get some things, you know. Make them do that thing. What? Make them into this thing right now. Oh, I will, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

07:58.838 --> 08:07.165
It's been remarked by many people that every hero that Conan wrote about, and of course... Back out of mood again.

08:09.423 --> 08:16.451
It's been said that every hero that Howard created for his pulp material was similar. They were all of the same type, whether it was a Western hero, whether it was Conan, whether it was King Cole back in the days of 
Atlantis. They all seemed to be of a type. And we remarked earlier that Howard seems to have put himself into those characters. Do you think other people are fascinated by this type of character? What draws readers or

08:36.118 --> 08:41.050
what did draw them and still draws them to this kind of hero? Dr. Kreider, do you think you have any? Well, let's talk about men. I often wonder If women read the Conan stories with any enjoyment, they might have to for 
research purposes, like Dr. Laughlin, but we might ask her to admit whether she enjoys them. But this is the perfect male fantasy figure, the lone hero with his sword, or maybe in a Western story, his pistol. I'm sure

09:14.865 --> 09:18.869
that the psychological critics can make a great deal out of this. And virtually irresistible to women, but who nevertheless doesn't need the company of women because he's self-sufficient, he's strong, he can 
overcome nearly anything. And this hero fits in the Westerns. I think of one of my favorite Western characters, Randolph Scott, from years gone by, who almost always played the lone hero seldom, if ever, had a love

09:41.759 --> 09:56.818
story in his Western movie. I think it's a great fantasy figure that probably has a powerful appeal for men. Now, I'm not sure how much appeal you'd have for a woman. And maybe even, I probably shouldn't say this, but 
maybe even a sort of adolescent fantasy figure. And I can particularly see adolescents enjoying this kind of figure. That's when you go, or at least a lot of people who go through that phase of feeling. outcast or

10:26.633 --> 10:34.620
different and a fantasy figure like this really give somebody like this something to enjoy. Let Dr. Loughlin say what women might think about Conan. Well the point of being self-sufficient I think that can appeal to 
anyone. Sometime or another everyone wants to be self-sufficient but whether or not women can really identify with Conan as an example of self-sufficiency is another matter. I must say I don't particularly enjoy

10:53.236 --> 10:56.539
reading Conan. As I said, the character does not appeal to me greatly. I like the magical elements. I like the mean old, whatever it was, the sorcerer who brought him back to life with the magic stone. The one that was 
brought back to life. Zalton, I think. Yeah, Zalton. I liked him better than I liked Conan. The scary creatures, the Stephen King type hocus pocus. I don't find Conan very appealing. In fact, I do find the whole thing

11:23.595 --> 11:29.423
very adolescent, even childish at times. Of course, then again, the target audience he was writing for at that time was that audience. The pulp readers, the ones who got down and bought the pulp magazines off the 
newspaper rack were probably mainly teenagers. Howard, of course, had a great, I'm not sure what word to use, admiration for, fascination with the barbarian. Perhaps that's why Conan has been one of his most

11:49.844 --> 11:53.368
successful kind of heroes. Do you remember the story? I think it was called The Wit Shall Be Born, the one where Conan was crucified. I think that's one of the most powerful scenes in the Conan series, to get across the 
toughness. You know, Conan is crucified, you know, his legs, his arms are nailed to the cross.

12:13.510 --> 12:18.315
They pushed the cross over, and he tore himself out, was it, if I remember? Isn't that the one where he bites the vultures head off? Yeah, when he's crucified, the vulture comes and lands on him. You know, realizing he's 
going to die and he just bites the vultures head off. That was tough. And what young man wouldn't love it? The taste of blood. No, just the ultimate tough hero. Of course, I've read people who said they like Solomon Cain

12:41.521 --> 12:47.326
as much as if not more than Conan. He was a weird, sort of a hero, wasn't he more of a, from Puritan England? He was a misplaced Puritan who roamed the world all over. Didn't most of his stories take place in Africa? And 
fighting African magic and a lot of those, I believe. But you know, these stories that we're talking about, all of them seem to me to have very little that, you know, of a woman's element And women in the story just think

13:19.788 --> 13:23.891
about the character of women in the stories. They're just sort of there. And when you need them, maybe for a love scene or something. He really doesn't even have a love scene. He just, and Colin the Conqueror, the woman 
is there just to get him out of prison because as you said earlier, she found him irresistible when she saw him out the window three years ago as he drove by in a parade. Which is, to take this up to more modern things,

13:44.019 --> 13:51.307
that's exactly the way that James Bond movies work. All the women find him irresistible and get him out of trouble. Another powerful adolescent fantasy figure.

14:02.684 --> 14:18.731
Many people make a distinction between fantasy and science fiction and Howard, of course, is maybe the pulp fantasy writer Par excellence, but he did write one science fiction book or something that could be called 
science fiction, El Murik. The hero was a Conan type hero, but he was a modern man who was projected to another planet. Similar to the way Burroughs did some of his heroes and Carson of Venus and not Carson of Venus,

14:30.308 --> 14:37.038
similar to the way he did his hero, John Carter of Mars. But Howard's didn't seem to think much of science fiction from what I've read. He thought that fantasy was a more imaginative, more creative process. And of 
course, this is what he was involved in. Do you think a reader can like, appreciate the Howard type fantasy and perhaps a hardcore science fiction? at the same time, or are they distinct height, too distinct? The two

15:03.829 --> 15:11.337
things are distinct, the fantasy and the science fiction, but I think there are some readers who can enjoy both. I do, and I think I hate to think that I'm the only one. I like to read Larry Niven's Ring World, and I like to 
read Patricia McKillips' books about the harvest, and I like Robert E. Howard, Paul's, and I like Peter S. Beagle, The Last Unicorn, and I like Paul Anderson's Tall Zero. I can read any of that. I'm not sure that

15:39.993 --> 15:42.376
everybody is that way. I think there are some readers who prefer fantasy, and there are some readers who prefer science fiction, just as there are some who prefer hard science fiction. And I think that there's 
probably all sorts of in-group snobbism involved in all of these things. The hard science fiction fan doesn't particularly think very much of those people who like adventure-type science fiction, or maybe

16:04.295 --> 16:18.974
especially fantasy.

16:19.435 --> 16:21.217
This is putting you on the spot, this question. But do you have any useful distinctions or definitions that would separate the two, science fiction and fantasy? Well, it's not putting me on the spot since I've never 
read any two definitions that agree.

16:36.082 --> 16:51.268
My own distinction is that science fiction deals more with things that are probable and scientifically probable, or at least possible, whereas fantasy deals more with impossible things, non-existent things. I 
regard as impossible and non-existent, such as the power of magic, lost, races, and things of this nature. And while I enjoy reading about it, I really don't think that that's within the realm of possibility, whereas

17:08.159 --> 17:18.792
I think space travel is. But that might be putting me on the background. Some of you say, well, faster than light travel is an impossibility. Is that fantasy or science fiction? And I don't want to answer it. Would you 
say that Conan, the Conan work of Howard, would that be typical sword and sorcery? Would that be a proper term for it? That's probably what I would call it. because there's certainly plenty of sword play and there's

17:43.645 --> 17:50.275
plenty of sorcery involved in it. And others, some people make another distinction of what's referred to as heroic fantasy, which I believe is more in the Tolkien vein than the Robert E. Howard vein. Dr. Loughlin 
didn't, hasn't the camp written sword and sorcery type fantasy himself?

18:14.543 --> 18:16.165
He writes fantasy. I don't know if he has written Sorcery fantasy distinct from the Conan books or not. His fantasies generally don't involve Sorcery, do they? Well, books like The Tritonian Ring, for example, are 
what I would classify as Sorcery and Sorcery. But they're different from the Conan stuff. They still have the humor in them. that the camp is noted for and of course the camp is written straight historical novels

18:41.577 --> 19:11.095
like an elephant for Aristotle and Golden Wind and things of that nature so he has but he's done other sword and sorcery besides the Tritonian ring I'm sure if I could just think of the titles but to me science fiction 
adventure It's really not that much different from fantasy because so many of them that are called science fiction adventure, it takes place on another planet. Okay, it could just as easily have been taking place in a

19:21.139 --> 19:25.371
prehistoric time. They're getting you away from the present to some imaginary world. Now maybe their means of getting there are supposed to be more plausible than the means of getting there would be in fantasy. But 
the actual plot and the adventures that take place do not seem to be that much different to me. Because so you use magic, well is that really different from astral projection?

19:51.592 --> 20:02.030
Now I guess the hardcore science fiction would be more plausible than fantasy, but a whole lot that goes under the title of science fiction adventure to me isn't very distinct from fantasy. Well, there's a whole area 
you can't separate in which you can't separate the two. They blend together. David, I just had a few more isolated questions.

20:13.765 --> 20:20.850
Dr. Laughlin, in your research, you've been tracking down people here in Brownwood and cross planes all over the place. What have they had to say about Howard and what was he like? Well, I've talked with Lindsay Tyson 
in Cross Plains and Tevis Clyde Smith here in Brownwood and Jack Scott, who was the newspaper editor in Cross Plains. He was sent out as a reporter to cover the suicide. He's the one who found the suicide note in the

20:38.978 --> 20:44.807
typewriter, the poem, which I can't quote for you. It was sort of plagiarized from somebody else, all led, all done, pinned the curtain or something like that. His friends, his close friends, are very defensive of 
him. As I said earlier, they keep saying he wasn't crazy. They objected to the term schizoid. It's very painful for people like Lindsay Tyson to talk about it, perhaps because he loaned the gun to him. It's very

21:11.395 --> 21:15.480
emotionally upsetting to him to talk about it in much detail. a great deal of guilt for everyone in cross planes who was alive at that time. He didn't fit in with the other people. People did think he was nutty and then he 
committed suicide and I think a lot of people felt guilty, particularly a friend like Lindsay Tyson and he says he never mentioned suicide to me. There was He was kind of considered a harmless kook, I think, but after he

21:36.453 --> 21:46.092
committed suicide, he didn't, in a way, transform that image in their minds. He wanted to, with his suicide, I think, to do something heroic.

21:56.163 --> 21:58.586
He wanted to do something with suicide, something like that, right? Say that again. I think in his suicide, he wanted to do something heroic that would transform him and the eyes of all the people around him. And to an 
extent, it worked. Because instead of being a harmless cook, he became a tragic figure. He inflicted a great deal of guilt on all the people in the area.

22:20.509 --> 22:23.773
Most of the people remember him rather fondly. Some of the people do describe his relationship with his mother as actually perverse. And they say his mother seemed to want him to commit suicide when she died. She saw 
this as an example of his devotion, nearly like a woman taking praise from a suitor, from a boyfriend, kind of, oh, you know, he couldn't really do that. But in the same way she was trying to get him to, she saw this very

22:51.934 --> 22:59.344
flattering that her son had this devotion to her. Didn't you say that Tyson had helped Howard do some research on some of the things that he wrote? That was Smith. Tevis Clyde Smith. Tevis Clyde Smith. Now, Lindsey 
Tyson never had anything to do with Robert's writing. He kept his life in compartments. And Lindsey Tyson was in his compartment that didn't have anything to do with his intellectual life. He didn't share any of his

23:19.799 --> 23:22.763
intellectual life with Lindsey Tyson. What type of research would have Smith have done for Howard?

23:28.670 --> 23:34.497
Well, he did the research for, I believe the title is Red Flades of Black Cathay. and I'm sure that it was simply historical background. Now that's noted in that book from Zebra entitled The Book of Robert E. Howard. He 
didn't do much research, really. He just read a book or two. I don't think it's considered very accurate or trailing.

23:55.718 --> 24:01.444
I understand that I read a reminiscence by E. Hoffman Price when he came to visit Howard and Cross Plains. I understand that Howard whether this was true or not, thought he had enemies and he would carry a gun in his car 
and Price was startled one time. I think they were driving down the road and Howard slowed down into Bush and reached over and touched his gun and said, you have to watch out. You know, I have enemies. What was this all

24:18.748 --> 24:20.312
about? Again, I think a whole lot of this was play acting. Here was the fellow from California who had come out to see him, and I think he wanted to impress him with the old West image. I really think, but for Howard, his 
play acting and his life never were really clear cut. You know, he may have convinced himself of these things. He would work when he was working out with punching a punching bag, boxing. His father would ask him, why are

24:41.358 --> 24:43.240
you doing this? And he would say, well, I used to have to take a lot off people, and they'd push me around, and now I want to be able to push back. I want to be able to take care of myself. No one that I have talked with, and I've 
gone back to his junior high days, not to his grade school days, but I, well, yes I have. I talked with Annie Newton Davis, who knew him when he was nine. No one can remember anybody ever picking on Robert. They can't

25:05.362 --> 25:09.706
remember him ever having been involved in a scuffle in a school yard. This seems to have been completely in his imagination. And how much of it was he just trying to impress E. Hoffman Price and how much was he believed? 
Price believed it. The next paragraph, after he related the episode, he said, and the man was not kidding me. I could tell he was serious. He was kidding. He was not kidding that he believed it. And it means there or

25:29.409 --> 25:31.051
something. You said you've gone back and talked some of his teachers. In terms of formal education, how much did Howard have? No, I did not talk with his teachers from grade school. It was Annie Newton Davis, who was a 
neighbor who was older than he was. She was about 22, and he was nine. He went through cross planes, which had 10 grades. And at this time, high school had 11 grades. So he came to Brownwood High to finish his senior year,

25:55.548 --> 26:02.518
you know, to get the 11th year, which was a senior year then. And this was not at all uncommon. My great uncles did the same thing. They lived in small communities and they came into Brownwood and they boarded in 
Brownwood to finish that last year of high school. What was uncommon is that Howard's mother came with him. and kept house for him. Most of the boys came and kind of lived in a dormitory type situation in boarding houses

26:16.695 --> 26:23.465
and had a high time, I bet uncle said that he certainly did. Then he went back home to, Howard went back home to cross planes for a couple of years and came back to Howard Paine to get a business certificate. It was a one year 
program and I believe it took him a year and a half or something like that. It took bookkeeping, accounting, nothing in liberal arts, no one wants your history or anything. Did he ever get a job that came out of such

26:43.139 --> 26:46.784
experience or such coursework? I believe he tried to get a job as a bookkeeper and lasted about a week or two. He hated all of his employers. Again, that idea of lacking discipline, saying that he couldn't stand anyone 
to be in authority over him. That's why he hated school because he couldn't stand a teacher having authority over him.

27:07.270 --> 27:10.453
What in his, did Howard get out of Texas? Wasn't he out of state for a while in his travels? I read once where he was in New Orleans for a few weeks or a brief period of time. Yes, his father went back to take some medical 
training and I think something to do with eye problems. So his father was there for some medical training at Tulane. He lived there when he was about 13 or 14. Did he see the ocean? Did he have any experience with the ocean

27:33.098 --> 27:35.100
that you know of? That's a strange question, but he did write some of his pulp fiction on sailors. He did go to South Texas. He might have been around the Gulf, because I know he did go to South Texas. But I think he may have 
dipped into Mexico one time, too, but just like for two or three times.

27:54.207 --> 28:00.635
You've noted before, I think I would agree with this, that Howard's fiction seems to be wish fulfillment in a lot of respects. Besides his close friends, didn't he have a lot of correspondence with other professional 
authors who were writing for the same kinds of pulp magazines he did, was that in any sense an attempt to see himself as part of a circle, a group of like-minded men, friendship, for instance, lovecraft? He had a lot of

28:18.085 --> 28:20.430
correspondence with him, I understand, but never met him. I mean, was this something that he needed? Was this something he...

28:28.152 --> 28:29.433
You know, sought out. He needed it, and Lovecraft needed it both. Neither one of them had very many close friends where they lived, and certainly there weren't very many people who sympathized with Robert's literary 
aspirations, and he felt accepted by these people. As I said earlier, Dr. Howard would send his baby pictures and his manuscripts to people who had never met Robert, but who had corresponded with him cordially, and

28:44.647 --> 28:57.298
the father was so grateful for their Pen pal friendship with Robert that he would give them things

28:58.426 --> 29:22.999
That might get into the whole psychology of fandom though and The way because science-fiction fandom or fantasy fandom now the writers get together fans get together and they support Each other and who else would 
there be and cross planes for somebody to talk to? is literary aspirations. Yeah, you're probably going to have to cut this because you have people cutting your throat, but I think fandom today is very adolescent. It

29:34.346 --> 29:46.007
seems like so many of the people, now not all of them, we were there and we're not, we're mature, but so many of the people you see, there's, you can tell by looking at them, somehow they don't quite fit in anywhere else. 
They're not exactly winners. And so in this little circle, they're a winner. Except for us. Except for us. I may not want to qualify that. You're right. I'll have to edit that out. Most of the fans are losers. David,

30:03.643 --> 30:04.825
that's all I would have. I think we're, you know, myself.

30:52.923 --> 30:54.486
Okay, well listen, I appreciate it, Mr. Baum. Is this person related to you? Your brother? Okay. About what time would be the best time to call him to reach him during the day?

31:08.531 --> 31:09.733
Or in the evening, either one.

31:18.353 --> 31:26.907
Mostly just about anything that you might know about Mr. Howard and what it was he was like living in cross-plane, what it was like.

31:29.872 --> 31:30.152
Yes, sir.

31:41.470 --> 31:41.991
Okay. Well, I'll try to get ahold of him then.

32:12.893 --> 32:13.439
Okay.

33:31.345 --> 33:33.870
Okay, I'll try and give him a call then.

33:47.538 --> 33:48.460
Okay, yeah, I've got it.
