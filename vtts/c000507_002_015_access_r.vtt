00:01.955 --> 00:03.397
Ask you to explain what a pastiche is. Let me ask you the question, okay?

00:08.824 --> 00:13.991
Dr. Crider, could you explain what a pastiche is and what problems come up with the Conan material in relation to one? 
Well, in the sense that we've been talking about it, it's where one writer takes a character and a world like the Hyborian

00:21.108 --> 00:28.816
age created by another writer and writes new stories with the same character and the same setting. And he gets the full 
credit for the story, but the other writer has created the character and the historical setting. Also, De Camp did

00:38.987 --> 00:50.119
something similar where he took incomplete Howard stories and changed them into Conan stories. which would be a 
pastiche of a slightly different kind, but it's the same principle operating. And I'm not aware of any particular

00:58.236 --> 01:11.162
problems that arose, except, of course, by him doing this, he would have to ensure that the estate received part of his 
profits for him. Do you think that Conan is popular enough or Howard's work is so popular that perhaps we'll see an

01:12.087 --> 01:22.165
endless stream of books, pastiches by all sorts of authors? It looks like. of people who have done or will be doing these. 
And I don't know whether we've mentioned this, but there is a planned Conan movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan.

01:39.828 --> 01:48.436
If this is a huge success, like Star Wars, let's say, that could give even more interest to this kind of thing. And we may 
see Howard going on forever with these pastiches being I think it's possible that they would be continued because the

01:55.051 --> 02:11.266
original idea was to fill out Conan's life, you know, have his life completely covered by the past issues from, I don't 
know, his boyhood, but certainly all of his adult life when he was an old King Conan. And it's already gone beyond that.

02:13.568 --> 02:18.492
They filled out his life and then they're going back to, you know, this stage in his life, he did such and such. So 
certainly they're not going to stop with what would be the chronological life of Conan. So the potential to go on beyond

02:25.038 --> 02:25.661
is there. You mentioned to fill in Conan's life. Where do we get information about Conan's life unless it's been written 
in stories? Well, what they did was start with what Howard had written in his stories and say, if he were such and such an

02:32.125 --> 02:42.922
age in this story, and then a little bit later, he was in this part of the country. And in Conan the Conqueror, it 
mentions when he was a pirate and back in his pirate days, and that's part of the way he solves the crime and gets back the

02:43.303 --> 02:53.259
magical stone. So they would say, well, we'll write a pastiche about the pirate days. So that's what I mean when I say they 
filled out his life. That was the plan of Lancer Books, and that's what De Camp was trying to do. They were trying to

03:07.164 --> 03:15.681
arrange the books in chronological order, and then De Camp and others were writing these stories to fill in the gaps in 
his life. But if you look at the Lancer Books, I don't know how successful that was because they'll have One edition of it

03:20.472 --> 03:27.059
will say number four in the complete Conan, and the next edition will say number five, and it'll be the same book. Well, 
originally, though, the explanation for that, Bill, is that they

03:27.420 --> 03:36.289
numbered them by date of publication. The first one published was number one, the second one published, and then they 
came up with this idea of the chronological series and renumbered them all. That explains that. In other words, then,

03:46.561 --> 03:48.623
the author of a pastiche... would be attempting to remain true to the character of Conan, to what we know of his life, 
simply to fill in the details that Howard perhaps never got to. That's what I would expect. It's true that maybe some of

04:01.968 --> 04:11.260
these writers have not necessarily been true to the character of Conan as developed by Howard. Of course, every writer 
thinks that he's the one who's doing the true Conan stories. De Camp thinks his are the true Conan stories because he

04:16.506 --> 04:21.713
doesn't have the violence overt. He doesn't spend a lot of time describing the gore. even though it's there, and because 
he doesn't have a lot of sex in his, which Conan was practically asexual, really, even though he had a queen. And a son.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.051
Didn't he have a son, too? This was in the pastiches, not that I would try. But then Andrew Offutt, I'm sure, thinks that his 
is the true Conan, that he has Conan rape a girl, which Robert E. Howard would have probably but in Suicide earlier,

04:51.850 --> 04:57.356
rather than write about rape, you know, this was not something that you would do. And Offutt has done pastiches of other 
Howard characters. Solid frame, didn't he? I'm not sure. Didn't he do Bran Mak Morn? He did. For Zebra Books.

05:12.592 --> 05:16.236
Could you tell us a little bit about this Hyborian age? Was this a created world of Howard? Was it an actual time in history 
or was it totally imaginary?

05:24.453 --> 05:28.261
I don't know if you could say it was totally imaginary, but it was not an actual age. It was a prehistoric age, so 
everything to imagine about it could be possible. That's why I argued that the stirrups were not really necessarily an

05:33.131 --> 05:36.839
anachronism. Maybe they had them and then after You know, they had to be rediscovered or something. But they have 
actually done a map in trying to trace out the places, and they say it's amazing how well it fits over modern Europe. And so

05:50.341 --> 05:53.847
he kind of used a European landscape. Also, he has written a lot about how fascinated he was by the Picts, this group of 
native to the island of Britain that would fight the Roman soldiers. And he certainly tried to use some of the idea of the

06:06.185 --> 06:16.640
Picts and the barbarians fighting the invading Romans who represented civilization. But basically it is imaginary. 
Doesn't he also take in some of his stories, I think the King Kull series, back to the Atlantis or the Atlantean

06:21.027 --> 06:27.957
civilization? I think so. It would be the King Kull stories. I don't know whether those have been republished recently 
or not. I know Lancer did some of those, but I haven't seen any of those in so long. I'm not sure. How many Conan stories did

06:42.627 --> 06:45.851
he write that were published in his lifetime? Originals. Was it just a couple dozen? The only full-length book was Conan 
the Conqueror, and of course it was done serially, but I would say probably not more than a dozen. Somehow I'd get the

06:58.251 --> 06:59.714
number 18. Okay, now that might be 18 counting Conan the Conqueror, serials, something like that. Published ones. 
Right.

07:11.693 --> 07:20.088
The Bran Mak Morn series, I think he was the one who dealt with the Celtic environment, the Celtic heroes.

07:20.268 --> 07:21.911
Did he publish those in Weird Tales also? I don't know. I'm sure there's probably where, though, or else. Where else 
would they fit? Yeah, okay, okay.

07:37.580 --> 07:42.504
We could, I'd like, before we, you know, we'd like to say some more specifics, if we can, a little bit about his work. I 
think we've probably got enough on his life, do you think? Okay, I'm going to start talking maybe about the Conan heroes,

07:45.086 --> 07:50.791
just some general comments about his writing, try to get some things, you know. Make them to that thing. What? Make them 
into this thing, right? Oh, I will, yeah, yeah.

07:58.838 --> 08:07.165
It's been remarked by many people that every hero that Conan wrote about, and of course... Back out of the mood again.

08:09.423 --> 08:16.451
It's been said that every hero that Howard created for his pulp material was similar. They were all of the same type, 
whether it was a Western hero, whether it was Conan, whether it was King Kull back in the days of Atlantis. They all seemed

08:24.820 --> 08:26.042
to be of a type. And we remarked earlier that Howard seems to have put himself into those characters. Do you think other 
people are fascinated by this type of character? What draws readers, or what did draw them and still draws them to this

08:36.118 --> 08:41.050
kind of hero? Dr. Crider, do you think you have any? Well, let's talk about men. I often wonder... if women read the Conan 
stories with any enjoyment, they might have to for research purposes, like Dr. Laughlin, but we might ask her whether

08:49.248 --> 09:08.539
she enjoys them, but this is the perfect male fantasy figure, the lone hero, with his sword, or maybe in a Western story, 
his pistol. I'm sure that the psychological critics can make a great deal out of this. And virtually irresistible to

09:20.671 --> 09:37.429
women, but who nevertheless doesn't need the company of women because he's self-sufficient, he's strong, he can 
overcome nearly anything. And this hero fits in the westerns. I think of one of my favorite western characters,

09:41.759 --> 09:56.818
Randolph Scott, from years gone by, who almost always played the lone hero, seldom if ever had a love story in his western 
movie. I think he's a great fantasy figure that probably has a powerful appeal for men. Now, I'm not sure how much appeal

10:03.582 --> 10:07.487
you'd have for a woman. And maybe even, I probably shouldn't say this, but maybe even a sort of adolescent fantasy 
figure. And I can particularly see adolescents enjoying this kind of figure. That's when you go, or at least a lot of

10:21.385 --> 10:26.451
people, who go through that phase of feeling. outcast or different, and a fantasy figure like this would really give 
somebody like this something to enjoy. Let Dr. Laughlin say what women might think about Conan. Well, the point of being

10:39.925 --> 10:43.928
self-sufficient, I think that can appeal to anyone. Sometime or another, everyone wants to be self-sufficient. But 
whether or not women can really identify with Conan as an example of self-sufficiency is another matter. I must say I

10:53.236 --> 10:56.539
don't particularly enjoy reading Conan. As I said, the character does not appeal to me greatly. I like the magical 
elements. I like the mean old whatever he was, the sorcerer who brought him back to life with the magic stone. The one that

11:08.757 --> 11:10.039
was brought back to life. Xaltotun, I think. Yeah, Xaltotun. I liked him better than I liked Conan. You know, the scary 
creatures, the Stephen King type hocus pocus. I don't find Conan very appealing. In fact, I do find the whole thing very

11:23.595 --> 11:29.423
adolescent, even childish at times. Of course, then again, the target audience he was writing for at that time was that 
audience. The pulp readers, the ones who went down and bought the pulp magazines off the newspaper rack were probably

11:34.569 --> 11:40.898
mainly teenagers. Howard, of course, had a great, I'm not sure what word to use, admiration for, fascination with the 
barbarian. Perhaps that's why Conan has been one of his most successful kind of heroes. Do you remember the story? I

11:55.390 --> 11:58.774
think it was called The Witch Shall Be Born, the one where Conan was crucified. I think that's one of the most powerful 
scenes in the Conan series, to get across the toughness. You know, Conan is crucified. You know, his legs, his arms are

12:06.302 --> 12:09.405
nailed to the cross.

12:13.510 --> 12:18.315
They pushed the cross over, and he tore himself out, was it, if I remember? Isn't that the one where he bites the vulture's 
head off? Yeah, when he's crucified, the vulture comes and lands on him. You know, realizing he's going to die, and he

12:26.408 --> 12:29.631
just bites the vulture's head off. Now that's tough. And what young man wouldn't love it? A taste of blood. No, just the 
ultimate tough hero. Of course, I've read people who said they liked Solomon Kane as much as, if not more, than Conan. He

12:47.346 --> 12:48.387
was a weird... sort of a hero. Wasn't he more of a... from Puritan England? He was a misplaced Puritan who roamed the world 
over. Didn't most of his stories take place in Africa? And fighting African magic in a lot of those, I believe. But, you

13:07.491 --> 13:19.048
know, these stories that we're talking about, all of them seem to me to have very little that, you know, of a woman's 
element in And women in the story, just think about the character of women in the stories. They're just sort of there. And

13:28.040 --> 13:31.945
when you need them maybe for a love scene or something. He really doesn't even have a love scene. He just, in Conan the 
Conqueror, the woman is there just to get him out of prison because, as you said earlier, she found him irresistible when

13:33.526 --> 13:43.618
she saw him out the window three years ago as he drove by in a parade. Which is, to take this up to more modern things, that's 
exactly the way the James Bond movies work. All the women find him irresistible and get him out of trouble. Another

13:54.030 --> 13:57.034
powerful adolescent fantasy figure.

14:02.684 --> 14:18.731
Many people make a distinction between fantasy and science fiction, and Howard, of course, is maybe the pulp fantasy 
writer par excellence, but he did write one science fiction book, or something that could be called science fiction,

14:02.684 --> 14:18.731
Almuric. The hero was a Conan-type hero, but he was a modern man who was projected to another planet. Similar to the way 
Burroughs did some of his heroes in the... Carson of Venus and, no, not Carson of Venus, similar to the way he did his hero John

14:30.308 --> 14:37.038
Carter of Mars. But Howard didn't seem to think much of science fiction from what I've read. He thought that fantasy was a 
more imaginative, more creative process, and of course this is what he was involved in. Do you think a reader can like,

14:49.916 --> 14:58.088
appreciate the Howard-type fantasy and perhaps the hardcore science fiction at the same time? Or are they distinct, 
distinct height, too distinct? The two things are distinct, the fantasy and the science fiction, but I think there are

15:03.829 --> 15:11.337
some readers who can enjoy both. I do, and I think, I hate to think that I'm the only one. I like to read Larry Niven's 
Ringworld, and I like to read Patricia McKillop's books about the harvest, and I like Robert E. Howard, and I like Peter

15:29.219 --> 15:38.251
S. Beagle, The Last Unicorn, and I like Poul Anderson's Tall Zero. I can read any of that. I'm not sure that everybody is 
that way. I think there are some readers who prefer fantasy, and there are some readers who prefer science fiction, just

15:42.396 --> 15:56.374
as there are some who prefer hard science fiction. And I think that there's probably all sorts of in-group snobbism 
involved in all of these things. The hard science fiction fan doesn't particularly think very much of those people who

16:04.295 --> 16:18.974
like adventure type science fiction or maybe especially fantasy.

16:19.435 --> 16:26.344
This is putting you on the spot, this question, but do you have any useful distinctions or definitions that would 
separate the two, science fiction and fantasy? Well, it's not putting me on the spot since I've never read any two

16:27.488 --> 16:32.597
definitions that agree.

16:36.082 --> 16:51.268
My own distinction is that science fiction deals more with things that are probable and scientifically probable or at 
least possible, whereas fantasy deals more with impossible things, non-existent, things I regard as impossible and

16:51.738 --> 17:07.558
non-existent, such as the power of magic, lost races, and things of this nature. And while I enjoy reading about it, I 
really don't think that that's within the realm of possibility, whereas I think space travel is. But that might be

17:19.109 --> 17:21.412
putting me on bad ground. Somebody would say, well, faster than light travel is an impossibility. Is that fantasy or 
science fiction? And I don't want to answer that. Would you say that Conan, the Conan work of Howard, would that be

17:30.365 --> 17:36.073
typical sword and sorcery? Would that be a proper term for it? That's probably what I would call it. because there's 
certainly plenty of sword play and there's plenty of sorcery involved in it. And others, some people make another

17:50.516 --> 18:04.677
distinction of what's referred to as heroic fantasy, which I believe is more in the Tolkien vein than the Robert E. 
Howard vein. Dr. Laughlin, hasn't De Camp written sword and sorcery type fantasy himself?

18:14.543 --> 18:16.165
He writes fantasy. I don't know if he has written sword and sorcery fantasy distinct from the Conan books or not. His 
fantasies generally don't involve swords, do they? He has. Books like The Tritonian Ring, for example, are what I would

18:27.903 --> 18:34.192
classify as sword and sorcery. But they're different from the Conan stuff. They still have the humor in them. that 
De Camp is noted for. And of course, De Camp has written straight historical novels,

18:44.461 --> 19:03.125
like An Elephant for Aristotle, and Golden Wind, and things of that nature. But he's done other sword and sorcery 
besides the Tritonian Ring, I'm sure, if I could just think of the titles. But to me, science fiction adventure is really

19:12.053 --> 19:20.638
not that much different from fantasy because so many of them that are called science fiction adventure, it takes place 
on another planet. Okay, it could just as easily have been taking place in a prehistoric time. They're getting you away

19:26.397 --> 19:30.101
from the present to some imaginary world. Now, maybe their means of getting there are supposed to be more plausible than 
the means of getting there would be in fantasy. But the actual plot and the adventures that take place do not seem to be

19:38.611 --> 19:44.157
that much different to me. Because so you use magic, well, is that really different from astral projection?

19:51.592 --> 20:02.030
Now, I guess the hardcore science fiction would be more plausible than fantasy, but a whole lot that goes under the title 
of science fiction adventure to me isn't very distinct from fantasy. Well, there's a whole area in which you can't

20:02.430 --> 20:05.095
separate the two. They blend together. David, I just had a few more isolated questions.

20:13.765 --> 20:20.850
Dr. Laughlin, in your research, you've been tracking down people here in Brownwood and Cross Plains and all over the 
place. What have they had to say about Howard and what was he like? Well, I've talked with Lindsey Tyson in Cross Plains

20:26.219 --> 20:35.573
and Tevis Clyde Smith here in Brownwood and Jack Scott, who was the newspaper editor in Cross Plains. He was sent out as a 
reporter to cover the suicide. He's the one who found the suicide note in the typewriter, the poem, which I can't quote

20:38.978 --> 20:44.807
for you. It was sort of plagiarized from somebody else off, bled all done, pinned the curtain or something like that. His 
friends, his close friends, are very defensive of him. As I said earlier, they keep saying he wasn't crazy. They

21:01.623 --> 21:03.826
objected to the term schizoid. It's very painful for people like Lindsey Tyson to talk about it, perhaps because he 
loaned the gun to him. It is very emotionally upsetting to him to talk about it in much detail. A great deal of guilt from

21:15.460 --> 21:20.468
everyone in Cross Blanks who was alive at that time. He didn't fit in with the other people. People did think he was nutty, 
and then he committed suicide, and I think a lot of people felt guilty, particularly a friend like Lindsey Tyson, and he

21:23.072 --> 21:36.253
says he never mentioned suicide to me.

21:36.453 --> 21:39.239
He was kind of considered a harmless kook, I think. But after he committed suicide, he did in a way transform that image in 
their minds. He wanted to with his suicide, I think, to do something heroic.

21:56.163 --> 21:58.586
He wanted to do something with suicide, something like that. Say that again. I think in his suicide, he wanted to do 
something heroic that would transform him in the eyes of all the people around him. And to an extent, it worked. Because

22:07.455 --> 22:12.281
instead of being a harmless kook, he became a tragic figure. He inflicted a great deal of guilt on all the people in the 
area.

22:20.509 --> 22:23.773
Most of the people remember him rather fondly. Some of the people do describe his relationship with his mother as 
actually perverse.

22:33.845 --> 22:39.014
They say his mother seemed to want him to commit suicide when she died. She saw this as an example of his devotion, nearly 
like a woman taking Praise from a suitor, from a boyfriend, kind of, oh, you know, you couldn't really do that. But in the

22:51.934 --> 22:59.344
same way she was trying to get him to, she saw it as very flattering that her son had this devotion to him. Didn't you say 
that Tyson had helped Howard do some research on some of the things that he wrote? That was Smith. Tevis Clyde Smith.

23:06.973 --> 23:07.834
Tevis Clyde Smith. Now, Lindsey Tyson never had anything to do with Robert's writing. He kept his life in compartments, 
and Lindsey Tyson was in his compartment that didn't have anything to do with his intellectual life. He didn't share any

23:19.799 --> 23:22.763
of his intellectual life with Lindsey Tyson. What type of research would Smith have done for Howard?

23:28.670 --> 23:34.497
Well, he did the research for, I believe the title is Red Blades of Black Cathay. and I'm sure that it was simply historical 
background. Now that's noted in that book from Zebra entitled The Book of Robert E. Howard. He didn't do much research

23:44.927 --> 23:46.809
really. He just read a book or two. I don't think it's considered very accurate portrayal.

23:55.718 --> 24:01.444
I understand that I read a reminiscence by E. Hoffman Price when he came to visit Howard and Cross Plains. I understand 
that Howard whether this was true or not, thought he had enemies and he would carry a gun in his car. And Price was startled

24:08.844 --> 24:10.428
one time. I think they were driving down the road and Howard slowed down into Bush and reached over and touched his gun and 
said, you have to watch out. You know, I have enemies. What was this all about? Again, I think a whole lot of this was play

24:21.136 --> 24:23.398
acting. Here was the fellow from California. He'd come out to see him, and I think he wanted to impress him with the Old 
West image. I really think. But for Howard, his play acting and his life never were really clear cut. He may have

24:35.272 --> 24:36.913
convinced himself of these things. He would work when he was working out with punching a punching bag, boxing. His 
father would ask him, why are you doing this? And he would say, well, I used to have to take a lot off people, and they'd push

24:43.641 --> 24:49.227
me around, and now I want to be able to push back. I want to be able to take care of myself. No one that I have talked with, and 
I've gone back to his junior high days, not to his grade school days, but I, well, yes, I have. I talked with Andy Newton

24:57.815 --> 25:00.017
Davis, who knew him when he was nine. No one can remember anybody ever picking on Robert. They can't remember him ever 
having been involved in a scuffle in a schoolyard. This seems to have been completely in his imagination. And how much of

25:14.550 --> 25:19.695
it was he just trying to impress E. Hoffman Price, and how much was he believed at him? Price believed it. The next 
paragraph, after he related the episode, he said, and the man was not kidding me. I could tell he was serious. He was not

25:26.366 --> 25:31.051
kidding that he believed there were enemies there or something. You said you've gone back and talked to some of his 
teachers. In terms of formal education, how much did Howard have? Now, I did not talk with his teachers from grade

25:36.796 --> 25:41.241
school. It was Annie Newton Davis, who was a neighbor, who was older than he was. She was about 22 when he was nine. He went 
through Cross Plains, which had 10 grades. And at this time, high school had 11 grades. So he came to Brownwood High to

25:55.548 --> 26:02.518
finish his senior year, to get the 11th year, which was a senior year then. And this was not at all uncommon. My great 
uncles did the same thing. They lived in small communities, and they came into Brownwood, and they boarded in Brownwood

26:06.164 --> 26:11.372
to finish that last year of high school. What was uncommon is that Howard's mother came with him. and kept house for him. 
Most of the boys came and kind of lived in a dormitory-type situation in boarding houses and had a high time. My great

26:21.863 --> 26:23.465
uncle said that he certainly did. Then he went back home to, Howard went back home to Cross Plains for a couple of years and 
came back to Howard Payne to get a business certificate. It was a one-year program, and I believe it took him a year and a

26:33.239 --> 26:36.925
half or something like that. He took bookkeeping, accounting, nothing in liberal arts, no literature history or 
anything. Did he ever get a job that came out of such experience or such coursework? I believe he tried to get a job as a

26:47.765 --> 26:51.590
bookkeeper and lasted about a week or two. He hated all of his employers. Again, that idea of lacking discipline, saying 
that he couldn't stand anyone to be an authority over him. That's why he hated school, because he couldn't stand a

27:00.122 --> 27:03.747
teacher having authority over him.

27:07.270 --> 27:10.453
What in his, did Howard get out of Texas? Wasn't he out of state for a while in his travels? I read once where he was in New 
Orleans for a few weeks or a brief period of time. Yes, his father went back to take some medical training and I think

27:16.980 --> 27:25.690
something to do with eye problems. And so while his father was there for some medical training at Tulane, he lived there 
when he was about 13 or 14. Did he see the ocean? Did he have any experience with the ocean that you know of? That's a strange

27:35.705 --> 27:39.450
question, but he did write some of his pulp fiction on sailors and sailing. He did go to South Texas. He may have been 
around the Gulf, because I know he did go to South Texas. I think he may have dipped into Mexico one time, too, but just like

27:46.538 --> 27:50.042
for two or three days.

27:54.207 --> 28:00.635
You've noted before, I think I would agree with this, that Howard's fiction seems to be wish fulfillment in a lot of 
respects. Besides his close friends, didn't he have a lot of correspondence with other professional authors who were

28:06.485 --> 28:09.550
writing for the same kinds of pulp magazines he did. Was that in any sense an attempt to see himself as part of a circle, a 
group of like-minded men, friendship? For instance, Lovecraft. He had a lot of correspondence with him, I understand,

28:18.085 --> 28:20.430
but never met him. How many, I mean, was this something that he needed? Was this something he...

28:28.152 --> 28:29.173
you know sought out. I thought he needed it and Lovecraft needed it both. Neither one of them had very many close friends 
where they lived and certainly there weren't very many people who sympathized with Robert's literary aspirations and

28:31.775 --> 28:43.706
he felt accepted by these people. As I said earlier, Dr. Howard would send his baby pictures and his manuscripts to 
people who had never met Robert but who had corresponded with him cordially and the father was so grateful for their pen

28:58.426 --> 29:01.911
pal friendship with Robert, that he would give them things.

29:05.295 --> 29:19.454
That might get into the whole psychology of fandom, though, and the way because science fiction fandom or fantasy 
fandom now, the writers get together, the fans get together, and they support each other. And who else would there be in

29:19.955 --> 29:22.999
cross planes for somebody to talk to? his literary aspirations. Yeah, you're probably going to have to cut this because 
you have people cutting your throat, but I think fandom today is very adolescent. It seems like so many of the people, now

29:34.346 --> 29:46.007
not all of them, we were there and we're not, we're mature, but so many of the people you see, you can tell by looking at 
them, somehow they don't quite fit in anywhere else. They're not exactly winners. And so in this little circle, they're

29:48.612 --> 29:50.917
a winner. Except for us. Except for us. I mean, I want to qualify that. You're right. I'll have to edit that out. Most of the 
fans are losers. David, that's all I would have. I think we're, you know, myself.

30:52.923 --> 30:54.486
Okay, well, listen, I appreciate it, Mr. Baum. Is this person related to you, your brother? Okay. About what time would 
be the best time to call him, to reach him during the day?

31:08.531 --> 31:09.733
Or in the evening, either one.

31:18.353 --> 31:26.907
Mostly just about anything that you might know about Mr. Howard and what he was like living in Cross Plains, what it was 
like.

31:29.872 --> 31:30.152
Yes, sir.

31:41.470 --> 31:41.991
Okay. Well, I'll try to get a hold of him then.

32:12.893 --> 32:13.439
Okay.

33:31.345 --> 33:33.870
Okay, I'll try and give him a call then.

33:47.538 --> 33:48.460
Okay, yeah, I've got it.

34:03.290 --> 34:08.946
You don't remember any stories about Mr. Howard and what he was like?

34:38.963 --> 34:44.349
Listen,

34:38.963 --> 34:44.349
I appreciate your time, Mr. Baum.

35:00.005 --> 35:06.912
Yeah, mostly we're just looking for old stories about Mr. Howard, you know, what he was like, what he did in Cross Plains.

35:35.292 --> 35:37.455
Okay, I'll try and give your brother a call tomorrow then.

36:06.916 --> 36:07.397
Yeah. Oh, what you did was quite helpful. Yeah. Listen, I really appreciate it.

36:20.975 --> 36:21.216
Yeah. Well, listen, we appreciate the information you did give us is tracking this thing down sort of like detective 
work. And listen, we appreciate the information on your brother and we'll try and get in contact with him tomorrow.

36:34.213 --> 36:34.454
Okay. Thank you very much, sir. And thank you for your time. Okay.
