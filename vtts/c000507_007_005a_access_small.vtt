WEBVTT

00:01.420 --> 00:04.780
Okay Gordon, we don't know who you are and what you do but basically could you just tell

00:04.780 --> 00:08.360
us how you became involved with AggieCon and you became a chairman of whatever it was?

00:08.820 --> 00:12.600
Well four years ago I joined Sefford three weeks before AggieCon 11.

00:13.620 --> 00:19.080
I worked two movies and then AggieCon was the next week and basically I was just to

00:19.080 --> 00:19.980
go for it that one.

00:22.220 --> 00:27.060
And the following year I was assistant house manager for Sefford variable and that's the

00:27.060 --> 00:31.600
organization that sponsors AggieCon and I was an assistant house manager at the convention.

00:31.920 --> 00:37.580
That was for the night films and the following year I was the full house manager for both

00:38.360 --> 00:46.920
and this year our chairman resigned his position in mid-October and I took over for him in

00:46.920 --> 00:52.040
mid-October and the majority of the work like about 90% of it has been done since then.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.700
Okay you mentioned people like house manager and assistant house manager.

00:57.600 --> 01:03.260
The house managers we have two house managers at AggieCon one of them is the night films

01:03.260 --> 01:04.000
house manager.

01:04.300 --> 01:08.840
They're responsible for making sure that the movies that we show in the auditorium run

01:08.840 --> 01:11.540
smoothly and that we have workers there to keep an eye on the audience.

01:12.360 --> 01:17.140
The day house manager is responsible for getting people where they belong during the daytime

01:17.660 --> 01:19.700
at each one of the events we have scheduled.

01:20.820 --> 01:23.340
And the assistants will just be obviously assisting them.

01:24.260 --> 01:26.500
Well can you just a little bit more about what's Sefford variable?

01:27.260 --> 01:30.400
Sefford variable is a science fiction and fantasy committee.

01:30.980 --> 01:37.160
It's out of the student programs office here on campus and because we are a committee we

01:37.160 --> 01:39.740
do programming through the student programs office.

01:40.180 --> 01:46.100
Some of the other clubs on campus do their own activities and programming just for their

01:46.100 --> 01:51.600
own members but we program for the entire university as well as AggieCon which is for

01:51.600 --> 01:53.840
people who aren't even members of the university.

01:54.860 --> 01:58.780
In other words AggieCon is really done totally by students at the university.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.360
About 95% of the officers this year are students at the university.

02:04.000 --> 02:04.840
They don't have to be.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.860
We have a few who are not.

02:07.960 --> 02:13.680
Most of them are like we have one former student we have one person who is laying out for a

02:13.680 --> 02:17.580
few semesters while he works and that way he can become a Texas resident and not have

02:17.580 --> 02:18.540
to pay out of state tuition.

02:20.180 --> 02:25.340
And Becky Matthews who is one of our guests we kind of count her as a member of the convention

02:25.340 --> 02:30.880
committee because she was chairman of AggieCon 11 and has helped us with the roast program

02:30.880 --> 02:31.340
this year.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.440
Okay could you tell me just a little bit about the history behind AggieCon like how many years

02:36.440 --> 02:38.480
you've been in existence and what the original input is for us?

02:39.580 --> 02:43.980
Okay AggieCon number one so far as I know was not originally called AggieCon.

02:45.090 --> 02:51.480
It was just called the Texas A&M science fiction convention or something to that effect.

02:52.740 --> 02:58.880
And they just decided it would be real fun to invite an author down and have a little

02:58.880 --> 03:02.260
miniature convention that lasted two days and I think they showed three films.

03:03.580 --> 03:06.280
I saw a report on AggieCon four.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.460
I think AggieCon three was the first one that was called AggieCon.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.840
I saw a report on number four.

03:12.260 --> 03:20.080
They took in a total of $800 and spent $400 and they had two guests and showed six films

03:20.660 --> 03:21.180
total.

03:21.620 --> 03:23.800
And that was about all the programming they had.

03:25.440 --> 03:30.400
And since then we have moved onward and upward to better and better things to where this

03:30.400 --> 03:31.760
year we have 30 guests.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.100
We're showing eight major films at night.

03:34.400 --> 03:39.980
We have films running all day long and we have the panels and the readings.

03:41.020 --> 03:46.880
And our budget this year is something like to take in $15,000 and to spend around $14,000

03:47.480 --> 03:48.900
was what was budgeted.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.820
You speak of budget does that mean does that come from people who are registered from any

03:52.820 --> 03:53.700
school health or what?

03:54.580 --> 03:58.660
So far as the budget is concerned we have to write up our own budget because we are an

03:58.660 --> 03:59.920
agency of the state of Texas.

04:00.320 --> 04:05.800
So that's a variable being a committee here at the university is a part of the state and

04:05.800 --> 04:11.440
it's real funny because we have to turn in our budgets a year in advance before we actually

04:11.440 --> 04:15.440
even know how we did it this year's convention as in the budget for next year has already

04:15.440 --> 04:16.040
been submitted.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.820
Okay, the planning of it, how do you start planning one, like when one convention ends

04:22.820 --> 04:24.000
do you start planning the next year immediately?

04:24.300 --> 04:25.100
How far ahead do you have to work?

04:25.860 --> 04:29.660
We have already sent out some letters this year asking if people would like to be guests

04:29.660 --> 04:30.620
at AgiCon 15.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.640
Some of those went out last month as a matter of fact.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.820
So they really they actually overlap.

04:38.520 --> 04:42.820
Okay, how do you look for a when you plan the Agicon I guess the committee does the overall

04:42.820 --> 04:43.780
planning right?

04:44.500 --> 04:52.180
Do you look for a balance between authors, artists, you know other kinds of people or

04:52.180 --> 04:54.140
does it just simply anybody we can get will take?

04:55.140 --> 04:59.740
Well usually what we like to do is there are some authors here in Texas as well as some

04:59.740 --> 05:02.700
artists who are kind of like traditionalists at Agicon.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.300
They've been coming for several years.

05:04.960 --> 05:09.180
We try and invite all of them and usually most of them will come come down here.

05:10.200 --> 05:15.680
So far as our major guests, we have the guest of honor and we have a special guest.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.720
This year we were going to have co-guests of honor.

05:19.260 --> 05:23.660
We're going to have Anne McCaffrey as well as Harry Harrison, but Anne had to back out

05:23.660 --> 05:24.960
because of medical problems.

05:28.460 --> 05:32.340
Harry Harrison was then left as our only guest of honor, which in the past we've only had

05:32.340 --> 05:32.580
one.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.540
We have our special guest.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.580
Like I said, we have a toast master.

05:37.240 --> 05:43.920
This year is Dr. Chad Oliver from the University of Texas and he will be presenting a program

05:43.920 --> 05:46.060
at the banquet this evening.

05:46.060 --> 05:49.020
He said he'd give us 15 minutes of wit and humor.

05:49.860 --> 05:52.280
And we have our artist guest of honor.

05:52.700 --> 05:59.040
In addition this year we have Don Punshott and Real Musgrave who are actually on the

05:59.040 --> 05:59.640
guest lineup.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.200
We do have some other professional artists that are here.

06:03.420 --> 06:08.100
They are not guests, but we have Dale Harris and there's two or three others.

06:08.180 --> 06:16.040
I can't remember their names at the moment that are here with work on display in the

06:16.700 --> 06:23.340
We have one person serving on panels, Ms. Victoria Wheeler, who is very good at artwork

06:23.340 --> 06:23.880
and stuff.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.160
I would think she'd be termed a fan artist.

06:26.780 --> 06:31.640
And she appears on both of our art panels and she is a dealer in the dealer's room.

06:33.420 --> 06:38.940
So far as the rest of it, this year we have really tried to do more stuff for the artists

06:38.940 --> 06:40.080
than we ever have in the past.

06:40.740 --> 06:44.960
Usually we have like one panel, the amateur art contest, the auction and that's about

06:44.960 --> 06:45.160
it.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.620
And this year we've programmed two panels on art.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.300
We again have the auction and the contest.

06:53.360 --> 06:56.940
We have more judges for the contest this year than we've had in the past.

06:58.680 --> 07:02.800
Okay, what have you found to be the biggest problem in running this or planning it?

07:03.860 --> 07:10.060
The fact that all of the officers are students and we all have our homework here from the

07:10.060 --> 07:13.140
university plus all of the paperwork that is required.

07:14.380 --> 07:18.760
And I think the only reason that was a real problem at this convention was because none

07:18.760 --> 07:21.340
of the paperwork was done when I took over in mid-October.

07:22.300 --> 07:27.080
I ended up having to do the majority of the paperwork I and my officers at that point.

07:28.300 --> 07:35.320
Do you know how this convention compares in my guess size and other conventions in Texas?

07:36.880 --> 07:41.580
Well, we have been billed as the largest annual science fiction conventions so far as attendance

07:41.580 --> 07:42.320
is concerned.

07:43.490 --> 07:50.000
Overall I do believe that we have a larger attendance if you count both the one day passes

07:50.810 --> 07:54.520
as well as the full convention passes than what other science fiction conventions have.

07:55.380 --> 07:58.260
A lot of that is probably due to the students here on campus.

07:59.450 --> 08:03.580
But we do bring in quite a few outside individuals.

08:04.260 --> 08:10.540
For instance, this year we had 60 non-student convention passes for the full convention

08:10.540 --> 08:11.660
that were sold in advance.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.060
That means before March 1st.

08:15.180 --> 08:16.960
Do you have any idea what the attendance at this one was?

08:18.840 --> 08:23.980
At this particular convention, I know that right now we have a lot.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.280
Last night we sold all day yesterday as a total.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.520
We sold over a thousand one day passes.

08:31.060 --> 08:35.840
And I believe that the full convention passes if you add up the students and the non-students

08:35.840 --> 08:37.720
is probably over 500 right now.

08:41.380 --> 08:46.380
You sort of answered this and obviously I know the answer to it too but maybe a lot of the people who listen to the show don't.

08:46.460 --> 08:52.740
Could you just briefly sort of classify the different activities that a fan coming to the convention would have?

08:53.560 --> 08:56.620
Okay, if you come to the convention there of course are the movies.

08:57.480 --> 09:00.500
I believe they have movies just about every science fiction convention.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.200
We have the dealer's room which you can find just about anything and everything in there.

09:06.340 --> 09:15.800
From books to weapons to posters and other kind of paraphernalia from movies and the world of fantasy.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.460
We have the artists and the authors.

09:18.940 --> 09:20.300
They sit on panels.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.000
Some of the authors do readings for us.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.860
We had a NASA presentation yesterday.

09:28.600 --> 09:34.720
We have had one of those for the past three years and we consider that to be pretty regular at this convention.

09:36.220 --> 09:40.800
We're having a slideshow this afternoon on Don Pinchots' artwork.

09:41.800 --> 09:46.780
And we try to have an art slideshow or at least we've been trying to for the past three years.

09:48.160 --> 09:53.240
We have the two movie companies that are here, Disney and Columbia Pictures that are promoting films.

09:53.880 --> 10:00.320
And I believe that since I've been here at AggieCon 12 I believe we didn't have any movie promotions.

10:00.500 --> 10:04.080
But at 11 and 13 and at this one we have had movie promotions.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.060
We have trivia quizzes.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.080
We have the amateur art contest.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.480
We have the art auction as well as other stuff that's auctioned off.

10:13.480 --> 10:18.400
This year we had the world premiere performance of Mr. Harry Harrison's play.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.860
That is a first as far as I know.

10:23.800 --> 10:29.580
We also have the pro art gallery where pro artists can display their work and the fans can come and look at it.

10:30.020 --> 10:33.220
We have an autograph session, a guest reception.

10:34.700 --> 10:39.440
Plus you can usually find the guests down in the party room if they're not doing anything else.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.060
And let's see.

10:46.340 --> 10:49.760
There's the banquet itself which people can go to.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.260
The masquerade we have.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.220
And there's the Neil Barrett Jr. roast this year.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.420
And last year we had the Chad Oliver roast.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.400
And I don't remember if we had a roast program the year before that.

11:02.460 --> 11:07.020
But it looks like we're starting a tradition because at A&M if you do anything twice it's a tradition.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.500
We're just a little bit more about this stuff.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.140
This stuff of variable.

11:18.540 --> 11:22.460
That is a student committee.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.840
That means that a club is science fiction club.

11:25.140 --> 11:26.620
It started off as a club.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.600
On campus I believe you have to have at least 10 students interested in an activity that can find an advisor and you've got a club.

11:35.300 --> 11:38.540
And they set you up with an account here in the student finance office.

11:39.050 --> 11:41.040
You take in funds, you spend money.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.380
It's all recorded on paper.

11:44.260 --> 11:55.220
I think back before we became an actual committee, the difference in a committee being that the committees get some of their funding from the student service fees here on campus.

11:55.740 --> 12:00.240
Because those student service fees go for programming for all of the students on campus.

12:01.040 --> 12:07.900
And whereas clubs program for their members, the committees program for the entire campus.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.680
For everyone at the university.

12:11.660 --> 12:19.960
And some of the other committees are MSC Aggie Cinema who programs all films except those dealing with science fiction and fantasy.

12:21.420 --> 12:28.340
There is Town Hall who they arrange for the concerts that we have over in G. Raleigh White Coliseum.

12:30.540 --> 12:34.340
There's Opus who arranges...

12:35.820 --> 12:37.560
What is Opus down for?

12:39.580 --> 12:44.780
Something in performing arts society. I forget what the O is but you can probably look it up and fill in in this spot.

12:46.740 --> 12:52.060
They arrange for concerts and stage, some of the stage productions and stuff like that.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.760
There's an outdoor recreation committee. There's a regular recreation committee.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.320
Several other excellent committees that do programming here on campus.

13:01.980 --> 13:07.180
And the basic difference is we program for the whole university, a club just programs for itself.

13:07.960 --> 13:13.340
In other words, really set the variable and the reason now for its existence is to work all year gearing up for AggieCon.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.680
That's our reason for being.

13:15.380 --> 13:19.760
That's our major reason for being. However, we also program all year long.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.380
We show science fiction fantasy films here on campus.

13:23.100 --> 13:27.040
And we are a meeting place for science fiction fantasy fans here on campus.

13:27.680 --> 13:35.080
Also, on occasion, we do send delegates to other conventions within the state as well as outside the state.

13:35.480 --> 13:39.440
Usually in the summertime though because most of our students are busy during the fall and spring.

13:40.360 --> 13:45.500
Can you recall just briefly a list of the ones you remember your guests of honor or special guests from the past?

13:48.680 --> 13:50.820
I'm a real bad person to ask about this.

13:52.500 --> 14:00.040
Last year we had Roger Zalassny as our guest of honor and Fred Saber-Hagan was our special guest.

14:05.180 --> 14:08.220
Beyond that, I draw a complete blank even though I was here.

14:09.060 --> 14:14.540
We do have some old program books from our past conventions. We try and keep a collection of those.

14:16.020 --> 14:21.840
Anyone who's interested can certainly come up here or they could call us and we can get the information for them.

14:23.100 --> 14:28.940
Anytime they were interested, I do believe that AggieCon 7 was the first convention that actually had a program book.

14:30.020 --> 14:36.000
All of the others just kind of had a little schedule that was printed up on like one sheet of paper and put out.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.660
What about your part for next year?

14:40.840 --> 14:43.000
Next year I will be here just one semester.

14:43.620 --> 14:47.360
I will be here all summer attending the university. I will be here next fall.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.780
I'm supposed to be graduating at the end of next fall. That will be one semester late.

14:54.080 --> 15:00.660
I will be around to help next year's chairman if they have any questions or if next year's officers have any questions.

15:01.940 --> 15:10.520
Also, I have two other responsibilities this year. One of them is to round up all of the information that we have on this year's convention

15:10.520 --> 15:15.800
and give that to next year's officers so that they can use it in planning next year's convention.

15:16.660 --> 15:23.240
The second item I have to do is to write up a financial report for the convention and turn that in.

15:25.400 --> 15:29.500
Are you a serious science fiction fan? Are most of the people in 7 variable that way?

15:29.600 --> 15:31.140
Are they just in it for the social aspect?

15:32.060 --> 15:37.420
Both really. The majority of the people in there are really interested in science fiction.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.900
I myself am very interested in science fiction and fantasy.

15:43.280 --> 15:46.560
It is a pretty nice social atmosphere also.

15:47.420 --> 15:50.840
The majority of the people in the committee are real good friends and we get along real well.

15:52.200 --> 15:56.100
Do you have any overall opinion of the whole experience as it works?

15:56.320 --> 15:57.680
Is it a hassle?

15:58.100 --> 16:03.200
I would say that no one should criticize the way a science fiction fantasy convention is run

16:03.200 --> 16:05.340
until they have been on my end of the deal.

16:06.480 --> 16:12.220
Because until you have tried to set one of these things up you really don't have any understanding as to what it takes to do so.

16:13.620 --> 16:16.960
All of the paperwork and all of the correspondence that has to be done.

16:18.100 --> 16:23.680
It really is a very big job and I am sure that this year I could not have done it without the help of all of my officers.

16:24.100 --> 16:24.700
Is it worth it?

16:25.140 --> 16:28.380
It is worth it. Especially when things go right.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.280
It's nice to have the office and the guests and pretty nice people aren't they?

16:32.280 --> 16:35.920
We have gotten a lot of compliments from them this year. They are all very nice.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.260
A lot of them have complimented us saying this is a very good convention.

16:42.340 --> 16:49.500
David, Bill, you people? How many people are in your group that are working on a convention?

16:50.960 --> 16:55.480
We have our member right, 16 officers, 8 of those have assistants.

16:56.440 --> 17:03.820
We have probably 10 of what we termed gophers which means general officer for everything ridiculous.

17:05.200 --> 17:10.980
Basically they are the peons in your organization that go and do everything that the rest of us don't have time for.

17:12.660 --> 17:19.800
As far as workers at the convention, just general committee members that worked are probably another 10 to 20 of those.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.540
What is the Cepheid variable?

17:24.940 --> 17:28.660
Oh, I am sorry, what is it?

17:28.980 --> 17:37.340
A Cepheid variable is a pulsating star which there is one in the Cephas star system.

17:38.480 --> 17:43.320
If you look at it, it will appear to grow brighter and dimmer and occasionally change colors.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.760
That is where we took our name from.

17:48.560 --> 17:58.720
Also our regular committee t-shirts that the Cepheid variable people wear is kind of a play on some of the Greek fraternities.

17:58.840 --> 18:07.020
We took the letters delta sci-fi meaning changing science fiction for us here on campus that are interested in mathematics.

18:08.740 --> 18:10.680
That sort of fits that very well.

18:12.320 --> 18:20.840
Probably the only other thing I would like to add is that for Agicon it tends to be real difficult from year to year for us sometimes.

18:21.200 --> 18:25.560
Generally we do have almost a complete officer turnover from year to year.

18:26.140 --> 18:37.480
Definitely every four years when the people who were here three years ago or four years ago graduate, you lose a lot of really valuable people that know what is going on.

18:39.220 --> 18:48.420
This year I actually have six of my 16 officers or freshmen this year and have never even attended a science fiction convention before.

18:49.440 --> 18:54.420
Do sometimes the alumni come back and help a little bit with the X Cepheid variable?

18:54.940 --> 18:59.180
Yeah, I said earlier we have Becky Matthews who was chairman of Agicon 11.

19:00.020 --> 19:08.300
Also Steve Gould who is one of our guests was a member of Cepheid variable and I believe he was a chairman at one of the conventions also.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.080
Yeah, okay is there anything else you can think of?

19:15.360 --> 19:16.580
Nothing I know of right now.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.980
I know you're a pretty busy person.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.680
Yeah, I should probably get back.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.280
They're going to be opening up the dealer's room if they haven't already.

19:23.820 --> 19:25.200
I appreciate it very much.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.340
I appreciate your help getting us the room and everything.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.040
Listen, we'll send you tapes for this.

19:29.200 --> 19:29.440
Sure.
