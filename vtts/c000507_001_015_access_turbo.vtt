Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.960 --> 00:34.320
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.700
And here are your hosts.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.740
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.920 --> 00:49.980
Michael Bishop has written a number of stunning science fiction works, such as the novels Eyes of Fire,

00:50.160 --> 00:56.920
the 1983 Nebula-winning No Enemy But Time, and the Urban Nucleus series, A Little Knowledge and Catacomb Years.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.400
Bishop is also a master at writing short stories.

00:59.600 --> 01:05.980
Some of his outstanding stories are On the Street of Serpents, Death and Designation Among the Asadi, and The White Otters of Childhood.

01:05.980 --> 01:08.680
Fans and fellow writers alike have lauded Bishop.

01:08.920 --> 01:12.200
He has been nominated for some 11 Hugo and Nebula awards.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.220
Bishop's academic training is in English.

01:14.260 --> 01:16.780
We asked him why he writes science fiction rather than mainstream.

01:17.640 --> 01:23.260
Well, the truth is that I have wanted to be a writer since I was in about the eighth grade,

01:23.260 --> 01:27.060
and I did not necessarily want to be a science fiction writer.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.920
I wanted to be just a writer.

01:30.180 --> 01:35.220
The reason that I'm doing science fiction now, or have done primarily science fiction,

01:35.220 --> 01:43.500
is that I was first successful in submitting stories that had a fantastic or a science fictional element,

01:43.980 --> 01:45.380
and in having them sell.

01:45.600 --> 01:51.880
The other stories, the mainstream stories that I wrote, received primarily rejection slips early on.

01:53.820 --> 02:03.200
And as I've said before, I'm kind of like the rat in the experimental cage who goes to the lever and presses it,

02:03.220 --> 02:08.820
and when the food comes out of one particular lever, that's the one he goes back to and continues to press.

02:08.960 --> 02:13.540
And that's the way I have done as far as science fiction goes to some extent.

02:13.540 --> 02:19.420
It's not that I don't care for science fiction, and I'm doing it solely because it was profitable,

02:20.540 --> 02:23.200
or more profitable than the other type of writing,

02:23.780 --> 02:30.700
but simply that I ended up finding very receptive editors in this particular field,

02:31.460 --> 02:34.000
and that accounts for it, more or less.

02:35.260 --> 02:37.580
Science fiction is attractive to Bishop, too,

02:37.720 --> 02:41.280
because it allows him the freedom to write about a number of subjects and situations.

02:41.280 --> 02:48.160
I think that science fiction does permit a writer to deal with just about anything that he or she wishes to deal with.

02:49.580 --> 02:55.380
You can handle contemporary events by projecting them into the future.

02:55.380 --> 02:58.760
You can speculate about the past.

02:58.900 --> 03:01.380
You can speculate about the distant, distant future.

03:01.660 --> 03:04.300
You can speculate about origins and ultimate ends.

03:04.480 --> 03:08.760
So that I think that really science fiction is a tremendously flexible genre,

03:08.780 --> 03:11.040
and that's one of its main attractions to me.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.760
And one of the reasons why I think I continue to write it,

03:13.900 --> 03:18.420
even though I have aspirations to do other things and have done other things.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.960
A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire, Bishop's first novel, came out in 1975.

03:30.580 --> 03:33.480
Its revision, entitled Eyes of Fire, came out in 1980.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.500
This novel relates the conflict between two cultures,

03:36.500 --> 03:39.320
an advanced space-faring culture and a primitive one.

03:39.540 --> 03:44.500
As do many of Bishop's works, this novel carries a heavy, effectively used dose of anthropology.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.920
We asked Bishop about the basis of this book.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.620
It's a parable of some of the things that have happened in our past

03:50.620 --> 03:55.160
and that continue to happen in our relationships to primitive peoples today.

03:55.160 --> 04:01.800
And I probably should put primitive in quotes because that's a term that is frowned upon

04:01.800 --> 04:03.920
in anthropological circles right now.

04:04.380 --> 04:11.640
But at any rate, I do think that it was a kind of dramatic framing of situations

04:11.640 --> 04:15.680
that have taken place in the confrontation between advanced civilizations

04:15.680 --> 04:20.100
and supposedly primitive, in quotes, civilizations.

04:21.280 --> 04:29.560
And it seems to me that in projecting it into a setting on a distant planet,

04:30.520 --> 04:36.620
that I was just kind of presuming that this was the sort of thing that could happen over and over again.

04:36.620 --> 04:46.140
But at the same time, really, it was a comment on the conflict between two different approaches of viewing the world.

04:46.280 --> 04:55.140
One, rather, the technological approach, and one, the rather mystical or, what do you call it, the left brain side.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.380
We'll have more with Michael Bishop on our next show.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.620
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:08.760 --> 05:11.540
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:11.820 --> 05:14.820
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:02.340 --> 06:06.520
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:22.520 --> 06:27.880
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:36.340 --> 06:38.000
This is Daryl Lane.

06:38.180 --> 06:38.960
And Bill Vernon.

06:39.220 --> 06:43.240
Two closely related works by Michael Bishop are A Little Knowledge and Catacomb Years.

06:43.640 --> 06:47.920
A Little Knowledge is a collection of loosely connected short stories, and Catacomb Years is a novel.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.260
Both are about people who inhabit the urban nucleus of Atlanta,

06:51.720 --> 06:54.680
a future domed Atlanta isolated from the rest of the world.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.080
Here Bishop tells us why he used the concept of a domed city.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.960
Each one of the cities was its own universe, its own world.

07:02.100 --> 07:07.800
The people were withdrawn and isolated, and they practiced the kind of isolationism.

07:07.800 --> 07:13.480
In fact, in the story, "The Windows in Dante's Hell", the old woman, Amelia Longhope,

07:13.580 --> 07:20.800
who is bound by two people who were going to her apartment, really, to discover what's happened to her.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.520
They find that she has created an entire world in her apartment,

07:26.520 --> 07:30.980
which resembles the bridge of a starship, as from an old television program,

07:30.980 --> 07:35.640
and that she has been looking outward while her own society has been looking inward.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.240
So that was one of the things that I was trying to do with the domed city.

07:40.460 --> 07:47.680
I wasn't interested in the domed city as a technological marvel so much as I was in a...

07:48.340 --> 07:52.580
I guess I was looking at each city as a kind of petri dish,

07:52.580 --> 07:58.060
and I was trying to see what the human beings, the bacteria, whatever you want to call them,

07:58.240 --> 08:01.580
inside that petri dish were going to do, how they were going to behave,

08:02.200 --> 08:05.040
and why they were behaving in the ways that they did.

08:05.040 --> 08:14.620
So it was one way of focusing in on the human condition in an unusual way and in a metaphorical way.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.200
A recurring theme in Bishop's work seems to be an emphasis on eyes.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.720
For instance, there's his first novel, A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire.

08:39.960 --> 08:44.500
The Asadi and Transfigurations have prominent eyes which figure significantly in the plot.

08:44.620 --> 08:49.640
The aliens in his first short story, Pinyonfall, have strange multi-lensed eyes.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.480
We asked Bishop about eyes and what they symbolize.

08:53.160 --> 09:00.600
It has always seemed to me that the eyes are, what's the old cliche, the windows of the soul.

09:01.620 --> 09:12.100
And for an alien species, I think they would be similarly a means of looking into the heart of the creature who has those eyes.

09:14.040 --> 09:19.200
I think, too, I was looking early on when I wrote the early story, "Piñon Fall", which was my first story,

09:19.360 --> 09:23.400
I was looking for a way of making my aliens seem alien.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.040
And one of the ways was to describe them physically.

09:26.040 --> 09:32.980
And one of the most outstanding characteristics of any creature, I think, are the eyes

09:32.980 --> 09:35.860
and how they differ from one species to another.

09:36.100 --> 09:39.840
So the aliens in "Piñon Fall" had eyes like insects.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.860
In A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire, I guess I was, again, looking for a means,

09:47.080 --> 09:53.520
an exotic means of establishing the fact that my aliens were truly alien.

09:53.520 --> 10:00.000
And by giving them different eyes, eyes like gems, that was one way of doing that.

10:00.520 --> 10:06.740
There may have been some subliminal influence, too, from one of the novels of Ursula Le Guin.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.540
I'm trying to think now, which was A City of Illusions.

10:10.900 --> 10:14.120
I think one of her characters had very, very strange eyes.

10:14.220 --> 10:17.680
But Ursula Le Guin has been an influence on me from way back.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.480
And maybe that came into it to some extent, too.

10:21.840 --> 10:27.080
As far as the eyes of the Asadi go and the fact that they are a means of communication

10:27.080 --> 10:31.280
as well as a means of seeing and also a means of feeding,

10:31.280 --> 10:36.340
when you discover that they enabled these creatures to photosynthesize part of their food,

10:37.620 --> 10:42.900
I think there I was looking at the eyes in a functional sense as well as in a symbolic sense,

10:43.440 --> 10:50.300
as if they really were a physical component of their makeup that could help them survive.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.800
More with Michael Bishop on our next show.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

11:03.860 --> 11:06.640
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:06.640 --> 11:09.940
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:52.120 --> 11:56.100
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:12.100 --> 12:17.580
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.040
And here are your hosts.

12:26.420 --> 12:27.560
This is Bill Vernon.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.260
And Daryl Lane.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.760
One of science fiction writer Michael Bishop's most successful short stories is

12:31.760 --> 12:35.280
Death and Designation Among the Asadi, which appeared in 1973.

12:35.760 --> 12:39.020
In 1979, Bishop published the novel Transfigurations,

12:39.200 --> 12:41.440
which was a so-called fix-up of this short story.

12:41.700 --> 12:44.300
That is, the story served as the initial third of the novel,

12:44.420 --> 12:46.280
then more material was added to continue it.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.200
Here Bishop tells us how this came about.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.320
I think when I wrote that story back in 72 or 73,

12:52.360 --> 12:55.740
that I felt that I was pretty much finished with it, that it was complete.

12:57.860 --> 13:02.780
By the time I actually undertook to do Transfigurations,

13:02.780 --> 13:08.300
I had thought some more about the characters in that story, both the humans and the aliens.

13:08.300 --> 13:12.880
And I had also done a great deal of reading on human origins,

13:14.940 --> 13:20.300
a lot of which I worked into the novel that followed that one, No Enemy But Time.

13:20.440 --> 13:28.000
But at the same time, I guess I was really kind of laying the groundwork for No Enemy But Time

13:28.000 --> 13:31.680
with the research that I did that carried me through Transfigurations.

13:32.360 --> 13:39.320
The reason that I probably expanded Transfigurations or Death and Designation among the Asadi

13:39.320 --> 13:42.500
into a full-length novel that I called Transfigurations

13:42.500 --> 13:45.340
is that by that time I was a full-time writer.

13:46.460 --> 13:49.540
I knew that this was one of my most popular stories,

13:49.540 --> 13:51.680
that there had been questions about it.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.920
Some of the loose ends had not been tied up.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.720
And I wanted to deal with the material again.

13:58.720 --> 14:03.840
And I wanted to deal with it from the perspective of my new knowledge

14:03.840 --> 14:08.900
about human origins and primate anthology, that sort of thing.

14:09.060 --> 14:12.360
So that was one of the reasons that I went ahead,

14:13.060 --> 14:16.000
used the original novella as part of the text

14:16.000 --> 14:21.640
and created a good deal of more information about new characters

14:21.640 --> 14:26.120
and a sequel to the original novella in the course of the novel.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.320
Transfigurations details an anthropological study of a group of primitive aliens.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.680
Or as Bishop warns us, we must put the primitive in quotation marks.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.320
Anthropology forms the basis for Bishop's perhaps most important novel,

14:38.540 --> 14:39.520
No Enemy But Time.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.400
This novel won the 1983 Nebula Award.

14:42.660 --> 14:46.600
The protagonist, Joshua Kampa, is capable of a sort of time travel through dreams.

14:47.060 --> 14:50.960
In No Enemy But Time, he travels to a simulacrum of Pleistocene East Africa,

14:50.960 --> 14:53.460
an African inhabited by man's distant ancestors.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.580
Campa lives among these hominids, ostensibly to study them,

14:56.740 --> 14:58.400
but he gets involved in their lives.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.880
We commented to Bishop that writing this book must have required a lot of research.

15:02.580 --> 15:07.580
I've told people that I probably did three and a half to four years of research for that book,

15:07.580 --> 15:08.980
and I believe that that's true.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.220
And by that, I don't mean that I was continuously researching and doing nothing else,

15:13.340 --> 15:16.440
not writing anything else, but only researching.

15:16.440 --> 15:22.080
But I nevertheless did spend a great, great deal of time reading material

15:22.080 --> 15:27.340
to make my proto-humans, my hominids in that book,

15:28.100 --> 15:32.400
as near to the real thing as I could imagine.

15:33.380 --> 15:38.860
So I read people like Louis B. Leakey and Mary Leakey and Richard Leakey,

15:38.940 --> 15:41.520
the entire Leakey clan, Donald Johanson,

15:42.260 --> 15:47.920
everything I could get my hands on in scientific journals and news magazines

15:47.920 --> 15:52.660
that related to new discoveries in East Africa, Tanzania, Kenya,

15:52.980 --> 15:56.580
wherever they happened to be, Ethiopia, when Donald Johanson came along.

15:56.940 --> 16:02.780
So yes, I spent an awful lot of time researching the physical nature,

16:03.200 --> 16:07.500
the stature, the possible lifestyles of these hominids,

16:07.500 --> 16:13.900
but also the flora and fauna at the same period so that I could make a credible stab

16:13.900 --> 16:19.560
at what kinds of other animals they would encounter,

16:19.820 --> 16:23.140
what kind of vegetation they would be living among,

16:23.400 --> 16:27.780
how they would have to go about their survival strategies, in other words.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.740
So yes, that took me a lot of time.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.920
I found it very, very enjoyable while I was doing,

16:34.100 --> 16:37.940
and I've really kind of put it out of my mind since then.

16:38.180 --> 16:41.220
I imagine that I may come back to it later on,

16:41.300 --> 16:43.540
but I have kind of set it aside since then.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.420
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

16:53.600 --> 16:56.340
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

16:56.340 --> 16:59.660
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.980
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

17:45.160 --> 17:46.240
so stay with us.

18:02.260 --> 18:04.860
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

18:05.100 --> 18:07.720
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.160
And here are your hosts.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.480
This is David Carson.

18:17.660 --> 18:18.360
And Daryl Lane.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.180
You might have overheard some junior high or high school students talking about fighting trolls

18:22.180 --> 18:24.380
or battling an evil wizard and thought nothing of it.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.860
But you might stop and stare if you heard a lawyer or doctor saying the same thing.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.160
Well, it could happen and does most every weekend all across the U.S.,

18:31.160 --> 18:32.280
and it's spreading around the world.

18:32.540 --> 18:32.780
Right.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.760
What we're talking about is Dungeons & Dragons,

18:34.940 --> 18:37.560
a fantasy role-playing game produced by TSR Hobbies.

18:37.560 --> 18:41.620
We talked with Dr. John Eric Holmes, author of fantasy role-playing games,

18:41.780 --> 18:44.740
who edited the original basic set of rules for Dungeons & Dragons.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.200
Holmes teaches in the School of Medicine at USC.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.920
We asked him to give us a layman's description of the game.

18:51.080 --> 18:54.180
Dungeons & Dragons, or the other role-playing games,

18:54.760 --> 18:58.620
are a game where a group of people get together,

18:58.620 --> 19:05.020
and one of them devises the kind of skeleton outline of a story.

19:05.440 --> 19:09.480
In Dungeons & Dragons it would be a story about fabulous treasure

19:09.480 --> 19:13.440
or a monster in a cave or in a dungeon or something like that.

19:13.600 --> 19:19.400
And the other people, each one of them takes the part of a single adventurer.

19:20.030 --> 19:24.240
And in Dungeons & Dragons you can be an elf or a dwarf or a hobbit

19:24.240 --> 19:26.680
or a wizard or a hero.

19:28.660 --> 19:32.520
And then they pretend to go into the story

19:32.520 --> 19:35.960
and try and solve the mystery or find the treasure or whatever,

19:35.980 --> 19:38.640
and they all sit around the table and do this,

19:38.640 --> 19:45.680
and they decide how things come out if they have to decide how an event occurs

19:45.680 --> 19:50.260
by just rolling dice and consulting a table in the book to see how the things occur.

19:50.260 --> 19:54.820
So it's a story that's built up by a group of friends working together between them.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.260
That's what it is, really.

19:58.620 --> 20:01.780
Dungeons & Dragons, known as D&D, is similar to chess

20:01.780 --> 20:04.860
in that there are several different types of pieces or characters on the board.

20:05.060 --> 20:07.300
But the difference is that the players controlling the characters

20:07.300 --> 20:08.800
don't know what the whole board looks like.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.040
They only know the areas where they have been and where they are at the moment.

20:12.300 --> 20:16.100
Right. Any new area has to be explored, just as if you were really there.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.920
If you want to know what's behind a door,

20:17.920 --> 20:21.260
you tell the dungeon master that you want your character to open the door and look inside.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.000
The dungeon master, or DM, is like a referee.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.080
He knows the plot of the scenario the players are involved in

20:27.080 --> 20:29.340
and tells them of the outcome of their actions.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.340
The game can sound very involved with someone who has never played it,

20:32.400 --> 20:34.620
but most of the work is done by the dungeon master,

20:34.740 --> 20:36.080
who is usually an experienced player.

20:36.380 --> 20:40.260
The game's situation is similar to much of the fantasy literature that is popular today,

20:40.480 --> 20:41.340
but with a difference.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.160
Holmes talks about the popularity of Dungeons & Dragons

20:44.160 --> 20:46.280
and its relationship to current fantasy literature.

20:46.280 --> 20:50.540
Playing the game is different from reading a story.

20:52.120 --> 20:57.380
If you read a story, you can kind of imagine yourself being the hero,

20:57.380 --> 21:02.920
and if the story's well written, you can really get into the hero's problems

21:02.920 --> 21:07.380
and you can see the wonders that he sees and the excitement that he experiences.

21:09.720 --> 21:28.940
You can imagine how you might have handled things or what might happen if you had lived in those times.

21:28.940 --> 21:35.100
And there were a lot of people in the country at the time that Dungeons & Dragons were created

21:35.100 --> 21:40.560
who kind of had daydreams about what they would do if they were hobbits

21:40.560 --> 21:45.840
or if they were dwarves or if they were elves or heroes.

21:47.320 --> 21:57.100
And in the game, you come a lot closer to being a hobbit or a dwarf or an elf or a hero or a wizard

21:57.100 --> 22:03.500
than you do in just reading about it or that you do in just imagining it all by yourself

22:03.500 --> 22:06.560
because you have several other people playing with you,

22:06.560 --> 22:09.580
and let's say you decide that you want to be a wizard,

22:10.580 --> 22:16.420
and all your friends agree that you are a wizard or that you're a character in the game,

22:16.520 --> 22:20.620
but you start talking about that person as if it were yourself,

22:21.620 --> 22:22.600
is a wizard.

22:22.880 --> 22:28.660
And for, you know, four to six hours once a week in the evening,

22:29.180 --> 22:31.320
you feel like you really are that person.

22:31.320 --> 22:34.780
And that's a lot more exciting than just reading about such a person.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.840
More with Dr. Holmes on our next show.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.380
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:48.540 --> 22:51.340
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:51.600 --> 22:54.660
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.580
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:49.720 --> 23:50.820
so stay with us.

24:06.840 --> 24:09.460
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show,

24:09.720 --> 24:12.320
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.780
And here are your hosts.

24:20.860 --> 24:21.960
This is Daryl Lane.

24:22.100 --> 24:22.820
And David Carson.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.940
We're talking with Dr. John Eric Holmes,

24:25.140 --> 24:26.780
author of Fantasy Role Playing Games,

24:26.900 --> 24:28.980
about the leading fantasy game Dungeons & Dragons.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.220
The game was created by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson

24:32.220 --> 24:34.040
in the late 60s and early 70s.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.320
Gygax now runs TSR Hobbies,

24:36.460 --> 24:38.260
the company that produces Dungeons & Dragons,

24:38.400 --> 24:39.920
as well as other role playing games.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.580
Several years ago, there was an incident

24:41.580 --> 24:43.460
that put Dungeons & Dragons in the public eye.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.300
Supposedly, a student was killed

24:45.300 --> 24:47.040
playing a game of live Dungeons & Dragons

24:47.040 --> 24:48.680
in the steam tunnels under a university.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.560
That story made national news,

24:50.560 --> 24:52.100
but when the entire story was uncovered,

24:52.300 --> 24:53.320
it wasn't near as interesting

24:53.320 --> 24:55.500
and was buried in the back section, so to speak.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.740
We asked Holmes to relate the entire incident.

24:57.740 --> 25:04.660
Wasn't there a college student from Michigan

25:04.660 --> 25:08.200
who got killed playing live Dungeons & Dragons

25:08.200 --> 25:12.360
in the steam tunnels under Michigan State University?

25:12.360 --> 25:14.720
No, there wasn't.

25:16.160 --> 25:24.500
There was a college student at University of Michigan, I've forgotten which it was,

25:28.540 --> 25:29.500
who disappeared,

25:30.780 --> 25:32.880
and his family couldn't find him.

25:32.980 --> 25:34.800
He was a Dungeons & Dragons player,

25:35.400 --> 25:37.940
and one of the things that the investigators,

25:38.120 --> 25:39.460
and they hired a private detective,

25:39.600 --> 25:42.080
family hired a private detective to try and locate him.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.580
One of the things that he found was a series of maps,

25:46.620 --> 25:49.120
which were probably Dungeons & Dragons maps,

25:49.280 --> 25:50.620
a lot of mysterious maps.

25:50.620 --> 25:53.180
And somebody suggested that they were maps

25:53.180 --> 25:55.920
of the steam tunnels underneath the university

25:55.920 --> 25:59.080
and that people had been playing Dungeons & Dragons

25:59.080 --> 26:00.080
in the steam tunnels.

26:01.980 --> 26:03.100
As far as I know,

26:03.180 --> 26:05.520
that's never really been proven to be the case,

26:05.520 --> 26:07.940
that anybody was actually playing in the steam tunnels.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.380
Anyway, he turned up alive.

26:11.660 --> 26:13.020
He showed up,

26:14.120 --> 26:17.540
and I think he had gone to visit some member of his family

26:17.540 --> 26:19.240
some distance away.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.400
And when there was enough publicity,

26:22.440 --> 26:24.480
there was a lot of publicity about this,

26:24.880 --> 26:29.560
a lot of television and radio news coverage of it

26:29.560 --> 26:30.580
when it occurred,

26:32.060 --> 26:33.240
partly, I think,

26:33.340 --> 26:37.460
because the news media people sensed

26:37.460 --> 26:40.020
that this was a weird cult,

26:40.180 --> 26:42.940
like the Jonestown massacre thing,

26:42.940 --> 26:44.880
which had occurred a year or so before.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.500
And they thought they were on to something really bizarre.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.060
But he turned up alive,

26:51.080 --> 26:54.560
and his disappearance had to do with his own personal life

26:54.560 --> 26:56.360
and his own personal problems, I guess,

26:56.400 --> 26:59.440
and had nothing to do with his playing Dungeons & Dragons.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.820
Another controversy that has brought some criticism of the game

27:03.820 --> 27:06.460
is the use of certain mythological creatures in the game.

27:06.660 --> 27:09.340
The game's fantasy element includes demons and devils

27:09.340 --> 27:11.560
based either on popular books or classical myths.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.880
The accusation usually is

27:14.880 --> 27:19.400
that the game is dangerous

27:19.400 --> 27:23.780
because it's actually teaching children.

27:24.180 --> 27:26.020
Of course, the people who are playing the game

27:26.020 --> 27:28.340
are frequently adults and not children,

27:28.340 --> 27:29.120
but, you know,

27:29.220 --> 27:32.980
it depends on what age you consider to be a child,

27:32.980 --> 27:34.580
and there certainly are plenty of people

27:34.580 --> 27:36.420
12 years old playing the game.

27:38.400 --> 27:41.120
teaching them, you know,

27:41.240 --> 27:45.860
the evil occult and demonological ritual.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.380
And the people who make these accusations,

27:49.540 --> 27:50.700
as it turns out,

27:50.840 --> 27:53.880
are extremely religious people,

27:54.100 --> 27:55.700
fundamentalist religious people,

27:55.700 --> 27:58.540
who really believe in the existence

27:58.540 --> 28:00.100
of the devil and his demons.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.980
The flap over the use of the game,

28:05.200 --> 28:10.500
particularly its use as a club in a high school

28:10.500 --> 28:11.560
or something like that,

28:11.760 --> 28:16.300
usually ends up to be involved with this controversy

28:16.300 --> 28:20.440
about how serious do you take demonology.

28:21.260 --> 28:23.360
And if you're serious about it,

28:23.480 --> 28:25.560
then you don't want to have it as a game

28:26.380 --> 28:28.360
or even as part of a game.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.220
These elements can be left out of the game

28:31.220 --> 28:33.100
if the people playing find it offensive.

28:33.460 --> 28:35.220
There are hundreds of other mythical creatures

28:35.220 --> 28:36.840
to test the mettle of any adventurer.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.300
The game's creators never intended Dungeons & Dragons

28:39.300 --> 28:40.960
to offend anyone's religious beliefs.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.740
They only wanted to bring to life

28:42.740 --> 28:43.680
the elements of fantasy

28:43.680 --> 28:45.360
that so many people enjoy in books

28:45.360 --> 28:46.240
like Lord of the Rings.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.660
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:56.660 --> 28:59.640
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:59.640 --> 29:01.880
produced in conjunction with Odessa College

29:01.880 --> 29:02.980
in Odessa, Texas.
