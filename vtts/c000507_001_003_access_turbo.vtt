Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.220 --> 00:34.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.000
And here are your hosts.

00:43.580 --> 00:45.740
This is David Crews and Daryl Lane.

00:46.200 --> 00:51.320
One of the most honored and respected of today's science fiction authors is the English writer Brian Aldiss.

00:51.520 --> 00:58.820
His first science fiction story was published in 1954, and since then he's won every award the field has to offer, both in this country and throughout Europe.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.200
Aldiss is a craftsman of the highest order.

01:01.420 --> 01:08.920
The attention he gives to style, character, and structure demonstrates the literary polish that often distinguishes British science fiction from American.

01:09.180 --> 01:12.960
He's written a few non-science fiction novels, in fact, that have been bestsellers in England.

01:13.480 --> 01:17.620
We asked him why he chose to concentrate his career in science fiction rather than mainstream literature.

01:18.520 --> 01:27.480
Well, I regard myself as a writer, and this difference that seems to be so apparent to other people is not so apparent to me.

01:28.740 --> 01:38.640
I'm interested in a kind of literature of ideas, and sometimes that strays to one side of the science fiction fence and sometimes to another.

01:40.200 --> 01:45.900
But it's not as though one day I'm riding a horse and the next day I'm riding a cow.

01:46.920 --> 01:56.980
It's just that I'm in the same vehicle all the time, but sometimes the identification marks change.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.260
That's the way I see it.

02:00.420 --> 02:08.720
In some of his personal essays on science fiction, Aldiss tells of how he was introduced to the field as a child through lurid pulp magazines he found at Woolworths.

02:09.200 --> 02:14.060
His family disapproved of his reading such literature, but Aldiss was fascinated and wouldn't give it up.

02:14.180 --> 02:17.120
He explains why he was so drawn to science fiction at an early age.

02:17.880 --> 02:28.460
I believe it was really that I never had a firm conviction as a child that the world was as all the grown-ups claimed it to be.

02:29.020 --> 02:39.260
It seemed to me that it was a much more interesting place than any of them believed, or that they sought to deny it was an interesting place at all.

02:39.480 --> 02:46.540
They were all busy working in their shops and making their money and leading their routine lives.

02:47.340 --> 02:55.260
And I was a bit of a kind of escapologist, you see, when I was a child.

02:56.260 --> 03:06.280
I picked up a phrase from an old cowboy movie where one of the wrestlers says out of the corner of his mouth,

03:07.120 --> 03:09.980
Let's go while the going's good.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.640
And that became a kind of motto for me.

03:14.640 --> 03:20.280
And at the age of four, I was the hottest rustler in East Dereham, Norfolk.

03:20.740 --> 03:23.500
And I used to go while the going was good.

03:25.240 --> 03:31.420
So I had that streak of wildness in me, I suppose you could say.

03:32.840 --> 03:37.800
Aldiss' streak of wildness later led to unique experiments in some of his science fiction novels.

03:37.800 --> 03:45.940
He gained a reputation as an innovator, as a science fiction author who wasn't afraid to introduce new styles and concepts into a fairly traditional field.

03:46.220 --> 03:53.280
Two good examples of his innovative techniques were the novels Report on Probability A and Barefoot in the Head, published in the late 60s.

03:53.620 --> 03:57.360
Their complex styles were avant-garde and confusing to many science fiction readers.

03:57.360 --> 04:03.440
We asked Aldiss if he deliberately sought to open up science fiction or enlarge its boundaries with such experiments.

04:04.440 --> 04:10.180
Well, you understand that's not exactly a motive in writing to expand the field.

04:11.140 --> 04:16.740
I think what you think you're doing at the time is trying to find a little...

04:18.660 --> 04:20.380
How shall we mix the metaphor?

04:20.720 --> 04:29.220
Trying to find a little breathing space where the ground isn't too trampled already by the hordes of other writers.

04:30.300 --> 04:41.440
And so you seek out, I suppose, the perimeters of the field as it's currently defined.

04:42.140 --> 04:48.900
And in that way, if you accidentally extend it well, that's very nice.

04:49.780 --> 04:56.460
And of course, some people are grateful to you and other people are very cross with you for doing it because they say you're breaking the rules.

04:56.460 --> 04:59.780
Next time, we'll talk with Brian Aldiss about some of his works.

05:06.780 --> 05:12.200
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:12.480 --> 05:15.460
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:24.180 --> 05:45.380


05:45.460 --> 06:00.040


06:00.600 --> 06:04.660
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show

06:23.240 --> 06:26.040
a commentary on science fiction and fantasy

06:28.680 --> 06:30.520
and here are your hosts

06:34.920 --> 06:37.120
This is Daryl Lane and David Crews

06:37.120 --> 06:40.040
In 1973, Brian Aldiss published a book

06:40.040 --> 06:41.740
on the origin and history of science fiction

06:41.740 --> 06:43.240
entitled Billion Year Spree

06:43.240 --> 06:46.160
He gave us an interesting account of the reasons he wrote the book

06:46.160 --> 06:48.320
including some comments on one of his novels

06:48.320 --> 06:49.460
Barefoot in the Head

06:50.060 --> 06:54.260
Well, I'd written a novel called Barefoot in the Head

06:54.260 --> 06:57.060
and it really didn't receive

06:57.920 --> 07:00.000
a very kind initial attention

07:00.000 --> 07:02.340
although the premise was simple enough

07:03.600 --> 07:05.860
Barefoot in the Head was about

07:05.860 --> 07:08.800
the world stopped in its tracks by drugs

07:08.800 --> 07:10.640
This was the late 60s, remember?

07:11.840 --> 07:15.240
When the flower power people had been around

07:15.240 --> 07:19.760
and we had had all this love-in stuff

07:20.720 --> 07:23.320
and towards the end of the 60s

07:23.320 --> 07:27.660
the bills, as we say in England

07:27.660 --> 07:31.220
the checks were coming in for all that kind of stuff

07:31.220 --> 07:33.820
and they were already finding the fetuses

07:33.820 --> 07:36.200
in the trash cans of Haight-Ashbury

07:36.200 --> 07:39.500
so that Barefoot in the Head was an ambivalent book

07:39.500 --> 07:40.920
written in a difficult language

07:48.440 --> 07:55.900
and I was a little surprised at the tepid response it got

07:55.900 --> 07:57.680
the angry response it got

07:57.680 --> 07:58.860
the anonymous letters

07:58.860 --> 08:02.500
so I thought, well, let's be finished with the science fiction field

08:03.680 --> 08:06.440
and I thought, well, before I leave it

08:06.440 --> 08:08.300
I ought to write down

08:08.300 --> 08:10.100
all that I know and love about it

08:11.880 --> 08:12.960
before I forget

08:13.940 --> 08:14.940
and so really

08:14.940 --> 08:16.320
I settled down with that in mind

08:16.320 --> 08:17.560
to write Billion Year Spree

08:17.560 --> 08:19.660
and also to have an argument

08:19.660 --> 08:21.060
as I raised my hat

08:21.060 --> 08:24.640
and left the science fictional community

08:26.220 --> 08:28.720
but by the time I got to the end of the thing

08:28.720 --> 08:30.760
you know, three years had passed

08:30.760 --> 08:34.900
and just writing the book

08:34.900 --> 08:36.900
turned me on to science fiction again

08:37.720 --> 08:39.940
Billion Year Spree is full of Aldiss' personal

08:39.940 --> 08:41.120
but fascinating ideas

08:41.120 --> 08:42.920
One provocative idea

08:42.920 --> 08:44.660
heresy to some science fiction fans

08:44.660 --> 08:46.260
was that Hugo Gernsback

08:46.260 --> 08:47.780
the father of modern science fiction

08:47.780 --> 08:49.680
was a disastrous influence on the field

08:49.680 --> 08:51.780
We asked Aldiss what he meant by that

08:51.780 --> 08:54.120
Well, as you probably know

08:54.120 --> 08:56.280
that I did say something of that sort

08:56.280 --> 08:57.520
and since then

08:57.520 --> 09:00.120
people have been threatening to break my legs

09:00.120 --> 09:00.940
and my arms

09:00.940 --> 09:02.600
and shoot me and hang me

09:02.600 --> 09:05.040
and kick me out of the science fiction field

09:05.040 --> 09:06.980
and all sorts of things like that

09:07.700 --> 09:09.320
but I guess that

09:11.440 --> 09:15.000
what I was worried about

09:15.000 --> 09:16.660
was the way

09:17.460 --> 09:18.520
science fiction

09:18.520 --> 09:20.260
was segregated

09:20.260 --> 09:21.860
by Gernsback

09:21.860 --> 09:23.420
into a magazine

09:23.420 --> 09:26.960
so that if you wanted to find science fiction

09:26.960 --> 09:28.460
you had to go

09:28.460 --> 09:29.580
to a magazine

09:29.580 --> 09:30.340
that had

09:31.520 --> 09:33.180
a name like

09:33.180 --> 09:34.400
Astounding

09:34.400 --> 09:35.420
or Amazing

09:35.420 --> 09:36.880
or Staggering

09:36.880 --> 09:38.000
which had

09:38.000 --> 09:39.800
a huge

09:39.800 --> 09:41.400
three-dimensional title

09:41.400 --> 09:42.600
with rivets in it

09:44.320 --> 09:46.140
that resulted

09:46.140 --> 09:47.600
in a monoculture

09:47.600 --> 09:49.520
and we all know

09:49.520 --> 09:50.760
that there are dangers

09:50.760 --> 09:52.820
in monoculture

09:52.820 --> 09:54.300
and

09:54.300 --> 09:56.040
I simply thought

09:56.040 --> 09:56.380
that

09:56.380 --> 09:57.520
science fiction

09:57.520 --> 09:58.760
would be better

09:58.760 --> 10:00.000
as an

10:00.000 --> 10:01.420
uncaged animal

10:01.420 --> 10:02.120
that could

10:02.120 --> 10:03.520
rove at large

10:03.520 --> 10:04.560
where it would

10:04.560 --> 10:06.380
but

10:06.380 --> 10:07.420
nowadays

10:07.420 --> 10:08.940
people complain

10:08.940 --> 10:10.780
that science fiction

10:10.780 --> 10:11.680
is segregated

10:11.680 --> 10:12.760
and that people

10:12.760 --> 10:13.920
think you're funny

10:13.920 --> 10:14.940
if you read it

10:14.940 --> 10:15.380
and that

10:15.380 --> 10:16.440
it has to have

10:16.440 --> 10:17.280
a special place

10:17.280 --> 10:18.160
in a bookshop

10:18.160 --> 10:19.500
right next to

10:19.500 --> 10:21.020
weirdo cult books

10:21.020 --> 10:21.380
about

10:21.380 --> 10:22.840
flying saucers

10:22.840 --> 10:23.360
or whatever

10:23.360 --> 10:25.860
well my answer to that is

10:25.860 --> 10:26.840
that yes

10:26.840 --> 10:27.780
I agree

10:27.780 --> 10:29.260
I think that's too bad

10:29.260 --> 10:30.780
I think science fiction

10:30.780 --> 10:31.960
is much better than that

10:31.960 --> 10:33.120
but the reason

10:33.120 --> 10:34.300
why it is there

10:34.300 --> 10:35.280
is because

10:35.280 --> 10:36.580
of the segregation

10:36.580 --> 10:37.640
that was introduced

10:37.640 --> 10:39.060
by Hugo Gernsback

10:39.060 --> 10:40.880
that was my argument

10:41.780 --> 10:42.820
anyone seeking

10:42.820 --> 10:43.700
to gain a perspective

10:43.700 --> 10:44.500
on science fiction

10:44.500 --> 10:45.020
and fantasy

10:45.020 --> 10:45.520
should read

10:45.520 --> 10:46.400
Billion Year Spree

10:46.400 --> 10:47.420
a personal

10:47.420 --> 10:48.060
but fascinating

10:48.060 --> 10:48.900
account of the field

10:48.900 --> 10:50.000
by one of science fiction's

10:50.000 --> 10:50.880
true men of letters

10:50.880 --> 10:51.920
tomorrow more

10:51.920 --> 10:53.060
with Brian Aldiss

11:00.080 --> 11:01.220
this has been the

11:01.220 --> 11:02.780
science fiction radio show

11:02.780 --> 11:03.660
a production of the

11:03.660 --> 11:05.640
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

11:05.640 --> 11:06.780
produced in conjunction

11:06.780 --> 11:07.840
with Odessa College

11:07.840 --> 11:08.940
in Odessa, Texas

11:56.680 --> 11:59.540
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show

11:59.560 --> 12:00.880
So stay with us

12:16.240 --> 12:19.320
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show

12:19.320 --> 12:22.140
A commentary on science fiction and fantasy

12:24.840 --> 12:26.620
And here are your hosts

12:31.720 --> 12:33.040
This is David Crews

12:33.040 --> 12:33.920
And Daryl Lane

12:33.920 --> 12:38.340
Brian Aldiss does unexpected but fascinating things in his science fiction stories

12:38.340 --> 12:40.180
Though Aldiss is often an innovator

12:40.180 --> 12:43.400
He also understands and cherishes the traditions of science fiction

12:43.400 --> 12:46.720
Aldiss has demonstrated his fondness for science fiction's past

12:46.720 --> 12:48.780
By redoing some of its classic novels

12:48.780 --> 12:50.820
An Island Called Moreau, for instance

12:50.820 --> 12:53.720
Was based on H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau

12:53.720 --> 12:55.600
And his book Frankenstein Unbound

12:55.600 --> 12:57.300
Drew on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

12:57.300 --> 12:58.540
Published in 1818

12:58.540 --> 13:00.700
Which some call the first science fiction novel

13:00.700 --> 13:05.140
Aldiss relates the impulse behind his writing of Frankenstein Unbound

13:06.140 --> 13:10.480
I think that I write about the things that fascinate me most

13:10.480 --> 13:13.820
And I'm kind of a literary man

13:13.820 --> 13:16.800
And I certainly

13:16.800 --> 13:20.720
Much admire Mary Shelley's Frankenstein

13:20.720 --> 13:22.920
It's the most remarkable work for anyone

13:22.920 --> 13:24.860
Not least for a young lady

13:24.860 --> 13:27.660
Not quite touching 18

13:28.960 --> 13:34.020
And when I had the impulse to write Frankenstein Unbound

13:34.020 --> 13:38.080
It was really an exegetical impulse

13:38.080 --> 13:42.260
To draw everybody's attention if possible

13:42.260 --> 13:45.320
To the excellence of that original novel

13:45.320 --> 13:51.280
Which as you know has been slandered and pilloried

13:51.280 --> 13:52.660
By the filmmakers

13:52.660 --> 13:54.760
Who've seen nothing better in it

13:54.760 --> 13:59.400
Than a stupid, shambling, and inarticulate monster

13:59.400 --> 14:02.180
I wanted to restore the monster

14:02.180 --> 14:05.460
To his true evil power

14:05.460 --> 14:11.800
As an articulate feeling and maimed being

14:11.800 --> 14:14.660
Worthy of our compassion

14:14.660 --> 14:17.700
And perhaps our hatred

14:19.240 --> 14:21.520
Aldiss says there was a true creative impulse

14:21.520 --> 14:22.960
Behind Frankenstein Unbound

14:22.960 --> 14:25.340
But that wasn't so for an island called Moreau

14:26.240 --> 14:28.460
I have to admit that later on

14:28.460 --> 14:30.100
I did the same thing with Wells'

14:30.420 --> 14:32.200
Island of Dr. Moreau

14:34.460 --> 14:36.200
And that was

14:36.200 --> 14:37.640
I believe

14:37.640 --> 14:38.600
Ill-advised

14:38.600 --> 14:41.360
It's one of the few novels I've written

14:41.360 --> 14:42.660
That didn't begin with

14:42.660 --> 14:45.200
Some kind of genuine

14:48.700 --> 14:50.040
Lust to create

14:50.040 --> 14:51.520
Will to create

14:53.480 --> 14:55.440
With fire in my stomach

14:56.580 --> 14:58.700
I just thought it was something I could do

14:58.700 --> 15:00.580
And that was too tiny a motive

15:00.580 --> 15:01.100
I believe

15:01.100 --> 15:03.020
For the book that I eventually turned out

15:03.700 --> 15:05.520
I don't believe that it

15:06.880 --> 15:07.440
Supersedes

15:07.440 --> 15:08.460
Or in any way

15:09.260 --> 15:09.820
Aids

15:09.820 --> 15:10.880
The Wells

15:10.880 --> 15:11.900
Version

15:11.900 --> 15:13.860
The funny thing is

15:13.860 --> 15:15.160
I have to say

15:15.160 --> 15:18.200
That that novel was extremely well received

15:18.200 --> 15:19.580
In this country

15:19.580 --> 15:20.840
And in Great Britain

15:21.940 --> 15:24.360
Another Aldiss tribute to science fiction's past

15:24.360 --> 15:25.180
Is his novella

15:25.180 --> 15:26.000
The Saliva Tree

15:26.000 --> 15:27.260
It's a playful book

15:27.260 --> 15:28.980
A clever tribute to H.G. Wells

15:28.980 --> 15:31.160
Who happens to be an unseen character in it

15:31.160 --> 15:33.340
It's about an invisible alien monster

15:33.340 --> 15:35.680
Ravaging the countryside of late Victorian England

15:35.680 --> 15:38.000
Invading monsters and invisibility

15:38.000 --> 15:39.640
Are two of Wells' themes of course

15:39.640 --> 15:40.660
And during the story

15:40.660 --> 15:41.620
All of Wells' themes

15:41.620 --> 15:42.880
And the titles of his books

15:42.880 --> 15:44.200
Are somehow worked in

15:44.200 --> 15:45.940
The story's main character

15:45.940 --> 15:46.860
Gregory Rolles

15:46.860 --> 15:48.460
Has been writing letters to H.G. Wells

15:48.460 --> 15:49.920
About the happenings in the countryside

15:50.460 --> 15:51.900
Wells comes to meet Rolles

15:51.900 --> 15:52.780
As the story ends

15:53.740 --> 15:55.280
Our central character

15:55.280 --> 15:56.120
Is about

15:56.120 --> 15:58.360
To relate to H.G. Wells

15:58.360 --> 16:01.040
The horrific events

16:01.040 --> 16:01.960
That have gone on

16:01.960 --> 16:03.720
Down on the farm

16:04.920 --> 16:07.200
And in those events

16:07.200 --> 16:08.580
Are really

16:09.960 --> 16:11.320
The germs

16:11.320 --> 16:12.880
For all of

16:12.880 --> 16:14.500
Wells' science fiction

16:15.440 --> 16:16.420
I mean

16:16.420 --> 16:17.540
You know

16:17.540 --> 16:18.000
There's

16:19.080 --> 16:20.640
There's a kind of a

16:20.640 --> 16:22.460
A joke on H.G. Wells there

16:22.460 --> 16:23.060
I mean

16:23.060 --> 16:24.860
We all owe a great debt

16:24.860 --> 16:25.780
To H.G. Wells

16:25.780 --> 16:26.140
Because

16:26.140 --> 16:27.780
He preempted

16:27.780 --> 16:29.020
Almost all of the

16:29.020 --> 16:30.200
Science fiction themes

16:31.040 --> 16:32.200
And so in a way

16:32.200 --> 16:33.380
The saliva tree

16:33.380 --> 16:34.140
Is a kind of

16:34.140 --> 16:35.340
Horrific joke

16:35.340 --> 16:37.060
To show that in fact

16:37.060 --> 16:38.280
Wells didn't have

16:38.280 --> 16:39.480
Any original ideas

16:39.480 --> 16:40.220
They were all

16:40.220 --> 16:41.080
Given to him

16:41.080 --> 16:41.880
By this guy

16:41.880 --> 16:43.380
Who knocks on the door

16:43.380 --> 16:44.400
At the end of the story

16:45.640 --> 16:46.560
More on the works

16:46.560 --> 16:47.300
Of Brian Aldiss

16:47.300 --> 16:47.960
Next time

16:54.920 --> 16:55.860
This has been

16:55.860 --> 16:56.720
The Science Fiction

16:56.720 --> 16:57.560
Radio Show

16:57.560 --> 16:58.380
A production of

16:58.380 --> 16:59.160
The Permian Basin

16:59.160 --> 17:00.480
Science Fiction Association

17:00.480 --> 17:01.600
Produced in conjunction

17:01.600 --> 17:02.720
With Odessa College

17:02.720 --> 17:03.780
In Odessa, Texas

17:53.160 --> 17:54.180
Coming up next

17:54.180 --> 17:55.180
Is the Science Fiction

17:55.180 --> 17:55.920
Radio Show

17:55.920 --> 17:57.160
So stay with us

18:13.060 --> 18:14.220
This is the

18:14.220 --> 18:15.760
Science Fiction Radio Show

18:15.760 --> 18:17.060
A commentary on

18:17.060 --> 18:17.820
Science Fiction

18:17.820 --> 18:18.580
And fantasy

18:21.240 --> 18:23.060
And here are your hosts

18:27.500 --> 18:28.780
This is Daryl Lane

18:28.780 --> 18:29.780
And David Crews

18:29.780 --> 18:31.140
English science fiction

18:31.140 --> 18:32.060
Author Brian Aldiss

18:32.060 --> 18:33.080
Sometimes writes books

18:33.080 --> 18:33.680
Which are difficult

18:33.680 --> 18:34.560
To categorize

18:34.560 --> 18:35.520
Aldiss has written

18:35.520 --> 18:36.660
Familiar science fiction

18:36.660 --> 18:37.840
Such as his first novel

18:37.840 --> 18:38.620
Which was published

18:38.620 --> 18:39.240
In this country

18:39.240 --> 18:40.120
In 1959

18:40.120 --> 18:41.480
As Starship

18:41.480 --> 18:42.700
But many of his novels

18:42.700 --> 18:43.480
Are experimental

18:43.480 --> 18:44.240
Or avant-garde

18:44.240 --> 18:45.340
In both theme and structure

18:45.340 --> 18:46.920
Report on Probability A

18:46.920 --> 18:47.980
Published in 1969

18:47.980 --> 18:48.960
Is a good example

18:48.960 --> 18:49.560
Of this type

18:49.560 --> 18:51.680
A 1976 novel though

18:51.680 --> 18:52.940
The Malacia Tapestry

18:52.940 --> 18:54.100
Is one of his most

18:54.100 --> 18:54.840
Unique novels

18:54.840 --> 18:56.340
A strange but richly

18:56.340 --> 18:57.140
Rewarding book

18:57.140 --> 18:58.080
And it completely

18:58.080 --> 18:59.100
Resists categories

18:59.100 --> 19:00.180
It could be called

19:00.180 --> 19:00.860
Science Fiction

19:00.860 --> 19:01.940
But it's not quite that

19:01.940 --> 19:03.020
Some might say

19:03.020 --> 19:03.540
It's fantasy

19:03.540 --> 19:04.520
But it's not that either

19:04.520 --> 19:05.800
Aldiss talks about

19:05.800 --> 19:06.520
The inspiration

19:06.520 --> 19:07.440
Behind the book

19:08.460 --> 19:10.200
The model I had

19:11.820 --> 19:14.080
Was a pictorial one

19:14.080 --> 19:15.240
That's often the case

19:16.840 --> 19:18.600
Well in several of my novels

19:18.600 --> 19:24.040
I start from a pictorial beginning

19:24.040 --> 19:27.200
And my pictorial beginnings

19:27.200 --> 19:30.840
With Malacia were the etchings

19:30.840 --> 19:34.020
Which the Italian artist

19:34.020 --> 19:36.580
The Baroque artist GBT Epilo

19:36.580 --> 19:38.720
Made at the end of his life

19:38.720 --> 19:41.240
Towards the end of his life

19:41.240 --> 19:42.240
He retired

19:42.240 --> 19:44.840
And he started

19:44.840 --> 19:47.100
Etching

19:47.100 --> 19:50.760
These mysterious little pictures

19:50.760 --> 19:54.440
Of wizards

19:54.440 --> 19:56.300
Mountebanks

19:57.740 --> 19:59.140
Soldiers

19:59.140 --> 20:01.660
Punchinellos

20:01.660 --> 20:04.620
People being dug out of the ground

20:04.620 --> 20:05.580
From graves

20:07.480 --> 20:08.040
Owls

20:08.660 --> 20:10.340
Serpents burning on altars

20:10.340 --> 20:12.660
All sorts of mysterious symbols

20:12.660 --> 20:14.220
In these lovely little pictures

20:14.220 --> 20:16.420
And no one's actually figured out

20:16.420 --> 20:17.240
What they're meant to be

20:17.240 --> 20:18.600
It's like

20:18.600 --> 20:19.960
A science fictional

20:19.960 --> 20:21.440
Alternative world

20:22.120 --> 20:22.680
Where

20:24.120 --> 20:25.220
Magic rules

20:25.220 --> 20:26.440
I suppose you'd say

20:27.360 --> 20:28.440
And I suppose

20:28.440 --> 20:29.420
That was one of the things

20:29.420 --> 20:30.440
I liked about them

20:31.340 --> 20:31.900
So

20:31.900 --> 20:32.740
I thought

20:32.740 --> 20:33.800
Well if no one else

20:33.800 --> 20:35.420
Can reconstruct

20:35.420 --> 20:36.160
This world

20:36.160 --> 20:37.580
To their satisfaction

20:38.600 --> 20:39.940
I'll have a go at it

20:41.160 --> 20:42.580
And so I started

20:42.580 --> 20:43.680
Writing short stories

20:43.680 --> 20:44.280
Around

20:45.500 --> 20:46.800
The more haunting

20:46.800 --> 20:49.040
Of these etchings

20:49.040 --> 20:49.760
Of Tiepolo's.

20:50.860 --> 20:51.800
Malacia itself

20:51.800 --> 20:52.700
Is a grand city

20:52.700 --> 20:53.320
Which exists

20:53.320 --> 20:53.900
In what appears

20:53.900 --> 20:55.080
To be an alternate universe

20:55.080 --> 20:56.260
Suggestive of Earth's

20:56.260 --> 20:57.020
Ancient past

20:57.020 --> 20:58.340
There is no technology

20:58.340 --> 20:59.040
To speak of

20:59.040 --> 21:00.340
Sorcery of a limited sort

21:00.340 --> 21:01.100
Seems to work

21:01.100 --> 21:02.140
And there are all manner

21:02.140 --> 21:03.140
Of exotic creatures

21:03.140 --> 21:04.300
Such as flying beings

21:04.300 --> 21:05.280
Which resemble humans

21:05.280 --> 21:06.820
The novel's main concern

21:06.820 --> 21:07.320
Is art

21:07.320 --> 21:08.480
An unusual theme

21:08.480 --> 21:09.320
For a science fiction

21:09.320 --> 21:10.180
Or fantasy book

21:10.180 --> 21:11.420
Seemingly more appropriate

21:11.420 --> 21:12.480
For a romantic poet

21:12.480 --> 21:13.580
Aldiss told us

21:13.580 --> 21:14.480
That the theme of art

21:14.480 --> 21:15.760
Came out of a serious illness

21:15.760 --> 21:17.120
He had while writing the book

21:17.120 --> 21:21.180
The effect of this internal complaint

21:21.180 --> 21:23.060
I had this hepatitis

21:26.780 --> 21:28.580
Made me feel that

21:29.620 --> 21:31.000
Well my life span

21:31.000 --> 21:31.660
Was limited

21:32.580 --> 21:34.160
And I had frolicked about

21:34.160 --> 21:34.780
A good deal

21:34.780 --> 21:36.100
And had written some books

21:36.100 --> 21:37.000
That I perhaps

21:37.000 --> 21:38.280
Didn't take as seriously

21:38.280 --> 21:39.220
As I should do

21:40.520 --> 21:41.740
And that what I

21:41.740 --> 21:42.880
dearly loved

21:42.880 --> 21:43.860
Was writing

21:43.860 --> 21:45.740
And that I wanted to make

21:45.740 --> 21:47.240
A statement about art

21:49.300 --> 21:50.480
And really

21:50.480 --> 21:51.720
Malacia is

21:51.720 --> 21:53.180
It's all about art

21:53.180 --> 21:54.480
From the title onwards

21:54.480 --> 21:57.160
If the book has a power

21:57.160 --> 21:59.100
It is

21:59.100 --> 22:01.820
The power of

22:01.820 --> 22:03.620
Meditations on

22:03.620 --> 22:05.720
The nature of art

22:05.720 --> 22:07.380
Which is at once

22:07.380 --> 22:09.360
To transfigure

22:09.360 --> 22:11.460
And at the same time

22:11.460 --> 22:12.500
To petrify

22:12.500 --> 22:13.620
And as you know

22:13.620 --> 22:14.580
Malacia itself

22:14.580 --> 22:14.980
Is

22:14.980 --> 22:17.080
A city-state

22:17.080 --> 22:19.060
Under a curse

22:19.060 --> 22:20.000
Of

22:20.000 --> 22:22.260
Zero change

22:23.540 --> 22:24.920
Well that's like

22:24.920 --> 22:25.600
A work of art

22:25.600 --> 22:26.720
It's like Tiepolo's

22:26.720 --> 22:27.960
Little etchings

22:28.760 --> 22:30.300
They may be forever

22:30.980 --> 22:32.140
Enigmatic to us

22:32.140 --> 22:33.440
But they're forever

22:33.440 --> 22:34.220
Unchanging

22:35.000 --> 22:36.680
The Malacia Tapestry

22:36.680 --> 22:37.660
By one of the masters

22:37.660 --> 22:38.780
Of modern science fiction

22:38.780 --> 22:40.120
A difficult novel

22:40.120 --> 22:40.840
To categorize

22:40.840 --> 22:41.720
But a fascinating one

22:41.720 --> 22:42.140
To read

22:42.140 --> 22:43.160
More with author

22:43.160 --> 22:43.880

And Daryl Lane

24:26.020 --> 24:27.460
Brian Aldiss' latest

24:27.460 --> 24:28.640
Science Fiction novel

24:28.640 --> 24:29.560
Is the masterful

24:29.560 --> 24:30.560
Achievement of an author

24:30.560 --> 24:31.300
Who is at the height

24:31.300 --> 24:32.560
Of his very awesome powers

24:32.560 --> 24:33.560
It's called

24:33.560 --> 24:34.460
Helliconia Spring

24:34.460 --> 24:35.640
And it's the first volume

24:35.640 --> 24:36.200
Of a trilogy

24:36.200 --> 24:37.320
About an Earth-like planet

24:37.320 --> 24:38.200
Called Helliconia

24:38.200 --> 24:39.400
Aldiss tells us

24:39.400 --> 24:40.080
About the planet

24:40.080 --> 24:40.920
And the books

24:42.460 --> 24:42.980
Helliconia

24:42.980 --> 24:44.760
Is the name

24:44.760 --> 24:45.360
Of a planet

24:45.360 --> 24:46.320
That's really

24:46.320 --> 24:47.420
Much like Earth

24:47.420 --> 24:48.980
And a lot of

24:48.980 --> 24:49.780
Earth-like things

24:49.780 --> 24:50.560
Go on there

24:51.380 --> 24:52.140
But

24:53.200 --> 24:54.280
It is

24:54.280 --> 24:55.400
The child

24:55.400 --> 24:57.540
Of binary suns

24:58.340 --> 25:00.140
And it takes

25:00.140 --> 25:02.000
Two and a half thousand years

25:02.000 --> 25:03.320
To go round

25:03.320 --> 25:04.360
The primary

25:04.360 --> 25:06.180
I mean

25:06.180 --> 25:07.900
Two and a half thousand

25:07.900 --> 25:08.760
Earth years

25:11.500 --> 25:13.160
Which is to say

25:13.160 --> 25:14.380
That between

25:14.380 --> 25:15.560
One winter

25:15.560 --> 25:16.260
And the next

25:17.280 --> 25:18.420
You can have

25:18.420 --> 25:18.960
A whole lot

25:18.960 --> 25:19.920
Of civilizations

25:19.920 --> 25:21.640
Doing a whole lot

25:21.640 --> 25:22.960
Of declining

25:22.960 --> 25:23.720
And falling

25:24.740 --> 25:26.120
And of course

25:26.120 --> 25:27.860
Falling and rising

25:28.680 --> 25:30.340
And so that

25:30.340 --> 25:32.780
These three long volumes

25:32.780 --> 25:34.880
Really just cover

25:34.880 --> 25:36.760
Parts of

25:36.760 --> 25:38.100
One of Helliconia's

25:38.100 --> 25:38.880
Great years

25:39.880 --> 25:41.160
So there's

25:41.160 --> 25:41.960
At once

25:41.960 --> 25:44.140
This marvelous

25:44.140 --> 25:45.000
Continuity

25:45.000 --> 25:46.520
As I see it

25:46.520 --> 25:48.140
Of one year

25:48.140 --> 25:49.660
And yet

25:49.660 --> 25:51.080
Of many generations

25:51.080 --> 25:52.180
And many cultures

25:53.980 --> 25:55.080
And that's

25:55.080 --> 25:56.040
The basic plan

25:56.040 --> 25:56.640
Of the book

25:56.640 --> 25:58.380
They're simply titled

25:58.380 --> 25:59.160
The first one

25:59.160 --> 26:00.280
Is Helliconia Spring

26:00.280 --> 26:00.900
That's the one

26:00.900 --> 26:01.480
That's out

26:01.480 --> 26:02.600
The one I'm writing

26:02.600 --> 26:03.860
Is Helliconia Summer

26:05.480 --> 26:06.860
And after that

26:06.860 --> 26:07.500
I go on

26:07.500 --> 26:08.560
To Helliconia Winter

26:09.680 --> 26:10.680
After centuries

26:10.680 --> 26:11.680
Of a deadening winter

26:11.680 --> 26:12.680
Spring is coming

26:12.680 --> 26:13.380
To Helliconia

26:13.380 --> 26:14.400
And the primitive

26:14.400 --> 26:15.080
Men of the planet

26:15.080 --> 26:15.720
Are waking up

26:15.720 --> 26:16.180
To the greater

26:16.180 --> 26:17.400
Possibilities of life

26:17.400 --> 26:18.880
To higher aspirations

26:18.880 --> 26:19.560
And knowledge

26:19.560 --> 26:20.600
To the construction

26:20.600 --> 26:21.620
Of a new civilization

26:21.620 --> 26:23.140
The first volume

26:23.140 --> 26:23.960
Traces the life

26:23.960 --> 26:24.880
Of a nomadic hunter

26:24.880 --> 26:25.640
Named Yuli

26:25.640 --> 26:26.720
And his descendants

26:27.440 --> 26:28.840
Because the first volume

26:28.840 --> 26:29.840
Is about the sun

26:29.840 --> 26:30.820
Bursting out

26:32.120 --> 26:33.720
The first volume

26:33.720 --> 26:34.640
Is just stacked

26:34.640 --> 26:35.540
Full of things

26:35.540 --> 26:36.480
Bursting out

26:36.480 --> 26:37.700
And people

26:37.700 --> 26:38.600
Bursting out

26:38.600 --> 26:39.280
Animals

26:39.280 --> 26:40.160
Bursting out

26:41.500 --> 26:42.460
It's a great

26:42.460 --> 26:43.580
Bursting out novel

26:51.380 --> 26:52.600
Circling Helliconia

26:52.600 --> 26:53.160
Is a satellite

26:53.160 --> 26:53.740
From Earth

26:53.740 --> 26:54.980
A huge observation

26:54.980 --> 26:55.380
Station

26:55.380 --> 26:56.180
Which monitors

26:56.180 --> 26:57.100
Everything that happens

26:57.100 --> 26:57.780
In Helliconia

26:57.780 --> 26:58.700
And beams it to Earth

26:58.700 --> 27:00.520
Aldiss spent a painstaking

27:00.520 --> 27:01.760
Four years on the book

27:01.760 --> 27:03.160
Striving for accuracy

27:03.160 --> 27:03.840
And realism

27:05.140 --> 27:06.340
Well I hope people

27:06.340 --> 27:07.480
Will find that it's

27:08.180 --> 27:09.820
Full of reality

27:10.560 --> 27:11.640
That's why I say

27:11.640 --> 27:12.460
The moral of it

27:12.460 --> 27:12.960
Should be

27:12.960 --> 27:14.300
Mere existence

27:14.860 --> 27:15.840
Because I think

27:15.840 --> 27:16.420
They recognize

27:16.420 --> 27:17.600
Their own lives

27:18.740 --> 27:19.940
Passing through the book

27:20.920 --> 27:23.120
And the other motive

27:23.120 --> 27:23.880
I had

27:23.880 --> 27:24.860
Was that

27:26.280 --> 27:28.720
I grew rather alarmed

27:28.720 --> 27:29.260
At the way

27:29.260 --> 27:30.880
So much science fiction

27:32.480 --> 27:34.080
Since it's become

27:34.080 --> 27:35.940
More popular

27:35.940 --> 27:38.280
Has been full of

27:39.260 --> 27:40.740
What shall we say

27:40.740 --> 27:41.860
Fantasy

27:41.860 --> 27:43.080
Wish fulfillment

27:43.080 --> 27:45.220
I didn't like that

27:45.220 --> 27:46.100
I think that

27:46.100 --> 27:47.120
Science fiction

27:47.120 --> 27:49.360
Should reflect

27:50.400 --> 27:52.580
The facts of life

27:53.680 --> 27:55.860
The hard facts of life

27:55.860 --> 27:58.180
It shouldn't just be

27:58.180 --> 28:00.000
Some nonsense about

28:00.000 --> 28:02.300
One guy against

28:02.300 --> 28:03.580
A malign empire

28:03.580 --> 28:04.660
Who goes out

28:04.660 --> 28:06.600
And you know

28:06.600 --> 28:08.040
Kills the chief baddie

28:08.760 --> 28:09.880
I thought it should

28:09.880 --> 28:10.500
Have a little more

28:10.500 --> 28:11.980
Contact for reality

28:11.980 --> 28:13.480
And moreover

28:13.480 --> 28:15.380
I'll sound old fashioned

28:15.380 --> 28:16.420
If I say this

28:16.420 --> 28:17.580
But I think

28:17.580 --> 28:18.660
That sort of thing

28:18.660 --> 28:20.040
Is better

28:20.040 --> 28:21.360
For the nation's

28:21.360 --> 28:21.840
Youth

28:21.840 --> 28:23.280
Than the old

28:23.280 --> 28:24.420
Hogwash about

28:25.460 --> 28:26.480
Telepathic dragons

28:26.480 --> 28:27.680
And all the rest of it

28:34.760 --> 28:35.600
Helliconia Spring

28:35.600 --> 28:36.360
Is a remarkable

28:36.360 --> 28:37.300
And unique achievement

28:37.300 --> 28:38.260
By a man who is not

28:38.260 --> 28:38.780
Just a great

28:38.780 --> 28:39.680
Science fiction writer

28:39.680 --> 28:40.540
But one of the

28:40.540 --> 28:41.120
Finest writers

28:41.120 --> 28:41.760
Of our time

28:49.140 --> 28:50.040
This has been

28:50.040 --> 28:50.900
The Science Fiction

28:50.900 --> 28:51.780
Radio Show

28:51.780 --> 28:52.620
A production of

28:52.620 --> 28:53.440
The Permian Basin

28:53.440 --> 28:54.780
Science Fiction Association

28:54.780 --> 28:55.960
Produced in conjunction

28:55.960 --> 28:57.080
With Odessa College

28:57.080 --> 28:58.200
In Odessa, Texas
