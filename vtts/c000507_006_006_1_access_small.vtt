WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:02.760
The tapes are rolling.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.180
Okay, the tapes are rolling.

00:08.120 --> 00:12.200
So I will ask you the first question. If you could give us some background

00:13.600 --> 00:19.060
where you grew up, how you got interested in what you do, and how you came to write science fiction.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.260
Okay, I grew up in Chatham, New Jersey,

00:23.780 --> 00:28.840
which is a suburb of New York, about 27, 28 miles west of New York.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.740
And I always thought I was going to be an engineer.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.220
My dad was an engineer, an electrochemical engineer.

00:38.320 --> 00:44.160
But for some reason, once I got to college, and I came to college out here where I am now at ELSA,

00:44.460 --> 00:51.560
Principia College, I got into chemistry as a major and decided that it was too specialized.

00:52.180 --> 00:56.880
And then somehow or other switched to English and just went on in English.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.980
I had done some reading of science fiction as a high school student,

01:02.440 --> 01:05.580
but then I pretty much dropped it until about eight years ago.

01:06.300 --> 01:11.940
And I was in bed for a while and just started reading science fiction for entertainment

01:11.940 --> 01:15.600
and became fascinated with it all over again.

01:16.220 --> 01:18.680
So that's how I got back into it.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.560
What other kinds of writing do you do now professionally besides science fiction, fancy?

01:28.320 --> 01:35.620
Well, I write a lot of reviews and quite a bit of poetry, some essays and some scholarly articles.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.800
Pretty much run the gamut.

01:40.080 --> 01:45.460
I teach a lot of writing and I try to do the kinds of writing that I professionally,

01:45.460 --> 01:48.340
I ask my students to do so I can give them examples.

01:49.340 --> 01:52.700
I had never published fiction before the breaking of North Wall Low.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.060
I felt that quite a gap. I guess it's plugged now.

02:00.580 --> 02:04.900
How does this kind of writing fit in with writing science fiction?

02:05.840 --> 02:15.340
It's really very different because most of these other kinds of writing are much more exacting.

02:15.340 --> 02:22.180
I think in some ways that is, in a sense, science fiction, although it should be good,

02:22.660 --> 02:24.800
should also be easy and entertaining.

02:25.680 --> 02:32.520
And so I think there's an atmosphere of fun that surrounds it both in the writing and the reading of it.

02:33.020 --> 02:36.620
And for me, it's really entertainment. I can do it.

02:36.760 --> 02:42.940
I'm tired late at night very often. I sit down to write and pretty soon I'm very wide awake.

02:42.940 --> 02:46.720
I can't do that with an essay, certainly not with poems.

02:47.960 --> 02:55.760
I think that writing poetry, as I've done now for well over 20 years, has helped me a great deal, though,

02:56.340 --> 03:04.480
in gaining a feel of the sounds of words and the kind of sound clusters that evoke certain meanings.

03:06.380 --> 03:15.540
And as you know, in poetry, every sound, every word is chiseled and worked on and worried about.

03:15.820 --> 03:25.200
A great deal more than in entertaining fiction, but still I think the art of poetry feeds over into the other art.

03:26.660 --> 03:29.880
I think those are the main differences that I see.

03:31.560 --> 03:35.600
There is a subcategory of science fiction, which is science fiction poetry.

03:35.880 --> 03:39.780
Have you ever attempted any of this or does that tempt you to try it?

03:40.280 --> 03:48.440
Yeah, I have written some. I used to belong to the Science Fiction Poetry Association, but I let my membership lapse.

03:49.760 --> 04:01.100
And for some reason or other, my imagination, my poetic imagination doesn't drift in the direction of science fiction.

04:01.820 --> 04:03.320
Once in a while I'll do something.

04:04.140 --> 04:12.340
I find that when I do write speculative or science fiction poetry, it tends to get very complicated and hard to understand.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.700
And I'm not an obscurantist in poetry.

04:16.980 --> 04:21.020
I believe that I give poetry readings, for example.

04:21.940 --> 04:25.260
I don't believe in giving a reading that mystifies everybody.

04:25.640 --> 04:31.720
I like a certain amount of immediacy, so it hasn't worked very well for me.

04:34.220 --> 04:37.260
In the three novels, occasionally there were songs.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.480
Were these original compositions, original poems?

04:40.480 --> 04:43.020
Yes, yes, they're all original.

04:44.360 --> 04:50.300
And some of them are, you know, really just quad-trained or in-stands.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.780
There's nothing terribly remarkable.

04:53.880 --> 05:00.540
I tried to, especially in the breaking of Northwell, use a variety of styles,

05:01.940 --> 05:06.580
inventing new styles for each of the tribal groups, and that was kind of fun.

05:07.800 --> 05:17.880
The most serious poem, I think, in all three volumes is one that is sung near the end of the Dome in the Forest.

05:18.640 --> 05:23.960
And that's actually a poem I've had around for years, and I think I kind of like it.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.980
It's sung by a character named Tristall.

05:29.240 --> 05:35.520
A friend of mine told me the other day that she has just been divorced,

05:36.580 --> 05:38.680
and I guess it was a friendly divorce or something,

05:39.480 --> 05:44.340
and she copies the poem that's sent it to her ex-husband, which is kind of amusing to me.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.660
It's on page 211 of the Dome in the Forest.

05:48.940 --> 05:51.620
It starts, Good Bye, My Favorite Stranger.

05:53.100 --> 05:57.140
I think that's the most serious poem in the three books.

05:58.680 --> 06:05.780
I'm trying to remember, was this when he was recalling his dead friend who was buried up on the hill?

06:06.840 --> 06:08.600
No, it's after that.

06:09.540 --> 06:15.200
Tristall and Tor are logging for the winter, and Stell goes to visit them.

06:15.200 --> 06:23.080
And Tristall sings in this song, and Stell is touched by it.

06:24.920 --> 06:32.460
And later on, it's, oh, I'm sorry, it happens after they've been logging.

06:32.840 --> 06:36.220
They come back to Stell Bargain, and they sing it for Stell, and he's touched by it.

06:36.220 --> 06:41.660
And then, Arro, Stell's wife, is really very disturbed by it,

06:41.700 --> 06:48.120
because she realizes that Tor and Tristall are leaving, and so she kind of crapped around a little bit.

06:48.760 --> 06:49.760
And then they go to bed.

06:54.980 --> 07:03.300
Early in the book, there's a song or poem which is recited by a strange character named Boute,

07:04.980 --> 07:07.420
and he is under the influence of drugs.

07:07.940 --> 07:09.200
He's interrupted in it.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.960
I rather like that poem, too.

07:14.960 --> 07:19.140
That is on page 51 of the Dome in the Forest.

07:22.640 --> 07:27.360
Well, it must be nice, even though you have let your membership lapse in the poetry association,

07:27.460 --> 07:30.340
that you can still write your poems and throw them in your books.

07:30.340 --> 07:34.700
Yes, I must admit it's a form of self-indulgence.

07:38.440 --> 07:44.100
Okay, you mentioned that the breaking of Northwell was your first published science fiction effort.

07:44.460 --> 07:47.460
So I'd like to talk a little bit about the mechanics of that.

07:48.740 --> 07:52.620
How long did it take you to, oh, how did the idea evolve?

07:52.800 --> 07:57.220
How long did it take you to think the idea of work it out and then start getting it on paper?

07:57.220 --> 08:01.320
Well, it was a very strange experience.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.780
It was one of the strangest experiences I've ever had.

08:04.840 --> 08:13.780
I always carry a notebook with me because I do write a lot and I like to have something ready if I get an idea.

08:14.680 --> 08:20.900
And if I'm ever waiting for something, I use the notebook to amuse myself.

08:21.380 --> 08:25.100
I was waiting for a meeting to start in the beginning of July.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.160
And this strange image came into my mind.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.640
And so I just started writing it down.

08:34.320 --> 08:39.740
And when the meeting did start, I really didn't hear any of the meeting because the idea was generating.

08:40.600 --> 08:47.020
And after the meeting, I went to my office and crammed a piece of paper in the typewriter

08:47.020 --> 08:52.460
and started typing and I typed the first three pages of what's now in print.

08:52.980 --> 08:55.860
And where the ideas came from, I had no idea.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.560
And the rest of the summer, I worked on it every day.

09:02.220 --> 09:06.520
I guess I must have been three or four days into it before I really realized I was writing a novel.

09:07.460 --> 09:14.080
And by September 5th, I had a first draft, which was substantially what the novel became.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.260
I did revise it, but not heavily.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.700
And I just don't know how it happened.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.580
I mean, it just sort of came and I didn't plot it.

09:24.940 --> 09:30.500
I've plotted the other two, but I just sort of let it happen

09:30.500 --> 09:35.520
and would go back to the typewriter every day to find out what was going to happen next.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.500
And I never got stuck.

09:39.180 --> 09:41.400
I always seemed to know what was going to happen.

09:41.400 --> 09:51.640
One day, I went to church and I was trying to work out a battle scene, a climactic battle with the taunt all.

09:52.860 --> 10:00.020
And I guess you're not supposed to go to church for this reason, but I didn't hear anything in church

10:00.020 --> 10:02.180
because it all started coming clear.

10:03.720 --> 10:09.420
And after church, I had lunch and started writing with one short break.

10:09.440 --> 10:14.400
I wrote till midnight and I had finished the battle scene and written 35 pages,

10:14.720 --> 10:18.020
which is by far the most I've ever written in one day.

10:19.780 --> 10:23.660
But really, I was sort of amazed at the experience all along

10:23.660 --> 10:29.760
because it seemed to be happening to me rather than something I was consciously doing.

10:32.500 --> 10:38.880
And the other novel took a lot more effort, but this one would just sort of handed to me in a way.

10:41.180 --> 10:44.900
You're mentioning of the battle scenes brings to mind a question,

10:45.180 --> 10:48.220
especially at the climax of the breaking of North Wall.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.920
The battles were really drawn out and the strategy was plotted.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.420
The other two books, it was mainly skirmishes and one-on-one combat.

10:55.420 --> 11:02.080
But do you have any experience with either planning battles or from historical perspectives?

11:02.240 --> 11:04.280
Or you're interested in this one because they were very realistic.

11:04.860 --> 11:08.380
No, I have absolutely none. I've never been in an army.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.200
I've read very little about that sort of thing.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.300
I don't know where that comes from.

11:14.640 --> 11:19.700
I've often wondered myself how I keep gravitating towards battle scenes

11:20.980 --> 11:24.040
when I don't think of myself as very belligerent.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.900
But I think the reasoning out of how it ought to be done

11:28.900 --> 11:32.680
and what would happen sort of fascinates me.

11:33.500 --> 11:38.540
And sometimes they're useful as metaphors for various kinds of human conflict.

11:43.760 --> 11:48.360
You discussed in quite a bit of detail the geography of the three rivers area

11:48.360 --> 11:53.240
where certainly the first one took place and parts of the others.

11:53.240 --> 11:58.260
Why did you locate the three main cities there? Where did that idea come from?

11:58.920 --> 12:08.580
Well, I've lived here two miles downriver from where I put Pell Bargain down for 18 years.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.700
And I'm utterly fascinated with this area of the United States.

12:13.420 --> 12:20.820
I think I became that way when I was way back in high school I read Bernard de Voto's book,

12:20.820 --> 12:25.560
The Course of Empire, which is mostly about the Louisiana Purchase

12:25.560 --> 12:31.900
and the move westward, especially Lewis and Clark, in their expedition.

12:32.940 --> 12:36.600
And the place has always had a sense of drama to me around here.

12:37.460 --> 12:43.940
And also this particular area has a fantastic archaeological history.

12:43.940 --> 12:53.480
It's the one area in all of North America that has the most, the densest, Indian or prehistoric population.

12:54.400 --> 12:59.000
And I've done a good deal of study of archaeology too.

12:59.500 --> 13:08.920
It just seemed like a natural place to put a rather settled civilization or culture rather

13:08.920 --> 13:12.940
and have these others impinge upon it.

13:13.640 --> 13:17.240
So I guess it really emerges from my own experience here.

13:17.620 --> 13:24.800
And I teach American literature, so I'm very aware of the American continent.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.580
I think it's a very dramatic place.

13:27.900 --> 13:31.980
So much has happened here and over so rapidly.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.780
It's a dramatic place to be.

13:36.640 --> 13:43.960
So I guess that's the reason, really, I come at science fiction from a different angle from most people,

13:44.620 --> 13:50.420
out of much more of a literary background than most science fiction writers,

13:51.120 --> 13:53.840
and particularly out of American lit.

13:54.700 --> 14:02.180
So I think my books tend to reach the two types a little more than most books do.

14:05.300 --> 14:16.100
Probably the thing to me that made the novels most interesting was the descriptions of the various tribes and their little idiosyncrasies and the names.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.600
Where did you come up with all this?

14:18.600 --> 14:31.880
Well, I envisioned the Pell Bar as a group that had been started by a woman named Amanda Pell,

14:32.540 --> 14:34.740
who had been a feminist.

14:36.060 --> 14:40.980
And she is a metallurgist, or was, from a caterpillar tractor up in Peoria.

14:41.640 --> 14:47.520
But she survived the Holocaust by the fact that she was spelunking down in the Ozarks.

14:48.380 --> 14:53.560
And it would be quite natural for her to set up a feminist society.

14:55.160 --> 15:06.520
And I really, I sort of tried to create the Pell Bar as a settled society with what you might call a nesting instinct.

15:06.520 --> 15:14.820
And a natural combination of self-protectiveness and non-aggressiveness,

15:15.580 --> 15:18.460
although they're certainly capable of great destructiveness.

15:19.520 --> 15:26.220
But potentially a settled place like that becomes a kind of mother of civilization.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.780
So that was what was in my mind there.

15:30.900 --> 15:44.300
I created the Shumai in Santani out of my memories of, well, in part, out of my memories of the conflict of Caesar and the Celts in Britain.

15:45.160 --> 15:57.160
The Shumai are very Celtic in their behavior because they're enthusiastic, artistic, kind of reckless and unorganized.

15:58.160 --> 16:03.420
Whereas the Santani are much more Roman.

16:04.340 --> 16:10.720
They organize into their star band and do everything in a pattern organized way.

16:11.660 --> 16:16.020
And I invented some backgrounds for these groups.

16:16.020 --> 16:26.600
The Shumai as offspring of the children of one farmer in southwestern Minnesota named Aaron Schumacher.

16:27.580 --> 16:41.300
And the Santani, the explorer scout troop led by Antonio Santani, who was a watchmaker in Memphis, who happened to have a love of Roman history.

16:42.120 --> 16:52.440
They were on a field trip to a coal mine in Tennessee, and so escaped the Holocaust there and created their society along quite different lines.

16:55.440 --> 17:08.820
The weapons in the breaking of North wall really come out of local archeology because during most of post-glacial Indian history in this area,

17:08.820 --> 17:21.760
the Indians were users of spears only fairly recently, well, 2000 years ago, they began to develop bows and arrows.

17:23.020 --> 17:31.700
And that coincides with their becoming a more settled culture, adapting to agriculture and that kind of thing.

17:32.560 --> 17:44.100
And I guess that culture shift was also in the back of my mind, although the strange thing about it was I figured all of this stuff out after I wrote the book.

17:44.800 --> 17:53.820
You know, that's where it must have come from rather than consciously adopting these things for the book.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.440
It might sound strange, but anyway, that's how it happened.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.900
I want to hit some more on that in a minute.

18:02.440 --> 18:17.740
Okay, you've explained kind of the macroscopic development of the tribes, but if we start zeroing in on people, the individuals of the tribes, they had their loves and their hates and their rituals and their religions and the games.

18:18.080 --> 18:23.220
You must be interested in games at least to have put so many different variations of games in the books.

18:23.340 --> 18:26.080
That lended character to these people too.

18:26.080 --> 18:43.240
Yes. Well, I have this theory that the Shumai being in love with the open, in a sense, are not necessarily made rendered stupid by that.

18:44.400 --> 18:51.940
As in some cultures, they're really extremely aware of their surroundings and they have a great sense of play.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.480
So it seemed quite natural to me that they would develop these games.

18:58.720 --> 19:08.300
And two of the games, for example, a star game and a game of Nana, are both functional for them too.

19:08.540 --> 19:14.580
The one helping them locate themselves and the other helping them sharpen their reflexes.

19:15.520 --> 19:21.880
So they're both games and they're educational tools as well.

19:24.460 --> 19:27.900
The other interesting tribe to me was the Emery.

19:28.300 --> 19:28.720
Oh, yeah.

19:28.980 --> 19:29.960
Are they Italians?

19:31.640 --> 19:34.880
Well, there are some Italian in their background.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.900
They're located north of Denver, up toward Boulder.

19:43.540 --> 19:48.040
And they're just the people in that area who survived.

19:50.600 --> 20:03.000
The particular reason for their, the particular function they have in the book is that I was trying to use, among other things, various societies as ways of looking at the question of domination.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
I mean, the pale bar are a female dominant society.

20:09.980 --> 20:21.560
The only centonies we see that we never see them at home and they are sort of a military society, but fairly democratic in the organization.

20:23.120 --> 20:29.700
The Shumai are a male dominated society, but kind of mildly so.

20:30.650 --> 20:36.300
And I needed a society in which the domination was very great.

20:37.620 --> 20:41.980
And the Emery served that function in the book.

20:42.680 --> 20:50.260
I discovered in writing the book that I, I did, I was trying to see where the effects of domination in society.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.000
Because every society does dominate in some ways.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.880
Certain groups dominate others.

20:55.880 --> 21:14.540
And I discovered that the more severe the domination was, the more danger that dominators really incurred because they lost a clear grasp of the feelings and aspirations of the people they were dominating.

21:15.540 --> 21:25.980
And the Emery are really a study in that the, the situation has grown so top heavy that it collapses.

21:26.640 --> 21:39.780
And I wanted, just attacked the hero who seems to operate as a catalyst wherever he appears in the book, just to be that the person who gives it that push that makes it topple.

21:41.340 --> 21:45.140
And I think that was very good of him to do.

21:45.400 --> 21:56.200
I tried to indicate that he naturally didn't cure the society of these habits right away, but they are moving in the direction of a more reasonable sense of government.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.400
Was just that modeled after any historical figure?

22:02.400 --> 22:05.240
No, I tried to just make him up.

22:05.560 --> 22:13.840
And I've, I even, I've tried to model characters after people I know, but I've never been able to make it work.

22:14.820 --> 22:22.660
About two pages into the character, they grow so vivid in so much themselves that they cease being anybody I know about.

22:24.540 --> 22:27.280
And just acquire their own personality.

22:29.140 --> 22:41.460
I discovered only last year when someone showed me that in the National Geographic, there is a minor deity in Pakistan named Jastak.

22:42.020 --> 22:44.060
And I thought I'd made the word up.

22:49.640 --> 22:58.080
The ends of the circle, my interpretation of it was that it was whimsical compared to the other two books.

22:58.280 --> 23:06.520
It didn't seem as serious and we learned about all these strange societies and they, they were quite odd.

23:06.800 --> 23:11.620
So it didn't, so it appeared to be whimsical to me is that did you have that in mind or is that just my interpretation?

23:12.540 --> 23:16.580
Well, I think it was somewhat more whimsical.

23:17.520 --> 23:31.520
The problem I set for myself there was I asked what are the skills that a young married couple has to know in order to be successfully married.

23:32.400 --> 23:38.960
And the book starts with a marriage that just fallen apart almost immediately.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.320
And in essence, they learn the skills.

23:44.700 --> 23:55.300
And as because of the peculiarities of Elbar society, Auro has much more self-knowledge than does El.

23:55.960 --> 24:05.900
What she lacks is the knowledge of the aspects and virtues of manhood as well as some of the disagreeable sides of males.

24:06.740 --> 24:15.640
And everything that happens to her in the book instructs her further about the nature and the validity of men.

24:17.200 --> 24:21.420
But Stel doesn't have a very clear sense of himself.

24:22.340 --> 24:26.640
And so his experience in my mind is a sort of an odyssey.

24:27.360 --> 24:37.020
That is, it's a psychological journey and the things he meets are the things I think he has to learn about himself.

24:38.180 --> 24:46.120
The artist of all of society is the Roti, which is, I'm not even sure it works.

24:47.000 --> 24:53.900
But the curious thing is that most people who read the book simply take it as a book of a series of adventures.

24:54.640 --> 24:55.920
And it works for them.

24:57.240 --> 25:06.560
And maybe I oughtn't to confess it, but, you know, if you add an E in front of Roti and a C at the end, you end up with the word erotic.

25:08.120 --> 25:12.940
And in essence, this is the problem.

25:13.780 --> 25:21.620
The psychological problem that Stel is brought to confront when he runs into them.

25:22.860 --> 25:29.940
He's now lived through the winter and he's growing more comfortable in his aloneness.

25:30.740 --> 25:35.140
And the problem of eroticism arises in his experience.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.660
He tries to flee from it.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.000
Somehow it keeps following him.

25:40.080 --> 25:46.260
And in order to escape it, he decides to be beyond it, as I've seen some people do.

25:46.260 --> 25:56.140
And in a sense, this is his entering into the Ozar society, which is a society of old people.

25:57.420 --> 26:03.520
And the problems he encounters there are essentially problems that one encounters with age.

26:04.560 --> 26:12.260
Decrepitude, jealousy, inability to function, and impending death.

26:13.100 --> 26:19.460
And in essence, he discovers that he can't really survive in that society or function in it.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.780
In essence, it costs him up.

26:22.340 --> 26:26.220
And as soon as he leaves, along comes the Roti again.

26:27.220 --> 26:34.820
And so he tries a new approach to ridding himself of that problem by just simply killing them.

26:35.880 --> 26:41.000
But in killing eroticism, he also kills feelings, essentially.

26:41.000 --> 26:47.220
So he enters into a feelingless period, a period of intense self-examination.

26:48.780 --> 26:54.960
And in the mountains, he meets in the character named Skula.

26:55.340 --> 27:05.700
He meets what he might become if he continues those tendencies and gets to have what I think of as a conversation with himself.

27:06.500 --> 27:14.860
And he does a lot of suffering, but out of this, he emerges with a kind of self-mastering and everything after that that he meets.

27:16.380 --> 27:27.540
He meets as someone more or less in control of himself, which is really what he has had to learn, as I can see him of it anyway.

27:31.740 --> 27:38.120
This is something on the spur of the moment as an English student in college years ago.

27:38.260 --> 27:46.360
I was always curious about, okay, you just explained what Stell was going through through these various devices.

27:47.360 --> 27:52.800
Did you sit down before you wrote the book and said, aha, I'm going to have him develop in this manner?

27:52.800 --> 27:58.080
Or is this kind of a post-mortem analysis of what you did?

27:58.680 --> 28:00.920
Did you sit out to write this and this was the symbolism?

28:01.540 --> 28:10.280
Yeah, when I wrote the Breaking of North Wall, so many people expressed amazement that I didn't sit down and plot it.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.840
And I just sort of wrote it.

28:12.900 --> 28:18.560
Somehow I felt, well, gee, they know more about this than I do, because most of them were writers.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.920
I better plot the next book.

28:22.140 --> 28:32.460
And so I spent quite a bit of time planning it all out and analyzing the problems that were to be encountered in the book.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.000
So it's a very different kind of book.

28:35.100 --> 28:36.580
It's much more of a planned book.

28:37.580 --> 28:42.660
I think I tried to consciously direct it at a fairly juvenile audience, too.

28:45.020 --> 28:51.680
And the themes are all fairly well spelled out, fairly explicitly in the book.

28:53.360 --> 29:02.160
I have had hopes that it would begin to be read in advanced high school or early college classes.

29:03.000 --> 29:09.300
And I know I tried it out on a group of freshmen I taught, which was a rather odd experience.

29:09.300 --> 29:18.240
But at any rate, they seemed to understand it and they wrote a paper on it and the thematic statements were in there.

29:19.880 --> 29:25.940
So it's much more of a literary production than North Wall.

29:30.240 --> 29:38.380
In the Dome in the Forest, you've been introduced as to another set of people, the people that have been in the Dome for centuries.

29:38.380 --> 29:45.940
And you went to great lengths to portray the advanced knowledge that they might bring as a two-edged sword.

29:46.740 --> 29:50.480
Is this come from your own private feelings?

29:51.160 --> 29:51.940
Yes, it does.

29:53.500 --> 30:06.760
And also, one of the main things I was trying to do in the book was to examine the difference between intuition and logic as a means of human understanding.

30:07.540 --> 30:19.240
And there are certain characters in the book, like Stale and Auro, and like Ruth Ann, who comes from the Dome and almost immediately marries a character named Blue.

30:20.520 --> 30:28.120
They are people who combine to a certain degree feeling and thought or intuition and logic.

30:28.680 --> 30:50.440
And they very quietly succeed in advancing their societies, but they're also extremeed as represented by Tor the Shumai as a man of incredible intuition and yielded from the Dome as a person of nearly pure logic.

30:51.280 --> 30:59.580
And those two really ought to get together, but they sort of instinctively also distrust each other.

31:00.760 --> 31:14.620
And in the end, well, in the book, Pelbargon goes through a severe internal struggle as to whether to accept the Dome people into their society.

31:15.300 --> 31:29.000
And in essence, the struggle to me is whether or not the society is going to turn from being essentially a religious society to being much more of a technological society.

31:29.740 --> 31:36.620
And they decide in favor of technology, but it's not entirely a victory, as I see it.

31:36.620 --> 31:53.580
Just as it is in our world, I think what we see going on in the Falkland Islands now is a good example of the degree to which technology has outrun the ability to relate to one another as human beings.

31:54.540 --> 32:06.240
And as the book continues, we see the logical people, the merely logical people continually making gross mistakes.

32:07.320 --> 32:20.600
And the intuitional people, but particularly Tor, finding less and less of a place in the Central Society of the Heart River, that is, Pelbar.

32:21.360 --> 32:34.360
And in the end, Tor and his nephew are sort of coughed up. They leave. They go essentially exploring, which is what intuition tends to do.

32:36.160 --> 32:50.840
And Eelen remains, but not entirely happily. You know, in essence, I don't think that either Tor or Eelen will ever be happy because they're too intense and they're too one-sided.

32:52.320 --> 33:01.000
But I tried to portray the assets you get with each of these kinds of thoughts and also the liabilities.

33:02.140 --> 33:18.360
The merely logical people do not perceive Pel's humanhood when he penetrates the dome and they're quite willing to contemplate intersecting him in order to see how he works because they don't have feelings.

33:20.660 --> 33:29.840
And I think, I don't know, ultimately, without intuition and feeling, without that outreach of sympathy, we get ourselves in terrible trouble.

33:31.100 --> 33:35.220
And yet we need logic. So that's essentially what I had in mind.

33:38.560 --> 33:52.760
Towards the end of that book, you describe the situation that led to the Great Fire and by some chance it resembles slightly the situation that our world is in now. What do you think the chances of something like that actually occurring are?

33:53.760 --> 34:01.660
Well, I am one of those people who are worried about it.

34:03.780 --> 34:11.160
The thing is we keep building more and more sophisticated devices for destroying ourselves.

34:11.160 --> 34:39.480
And the thing is too that even if Russia and the United States keep under control because we are relatively sophisticated in our perception of what might happen, right now, of course, Britain and France and Red China, India, almost certainly Israel, almost certainly South Africa, have the bomb.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.840
I see that I leave anybody else.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.040
I think that's it.

34:43.660 --> 34:53.400
And it looks as though Pakistan will have it soon. If the Israelis don't keep bombing Iraq, they're going to have it.

34:54.480 --> 34:58.660
I understand that Argentinians are manufacturing fishnable material.

35:02.080 --> 35:09.400
And there are much more volatile nations which are likely to have the bomb pretty soon.

35:09.400 --> 35:38.840
And I think that poses an immense threat to humanity because particularly of all of the interlacing treaties and alliances that everybody seems to have that tell very easily if, well, if Israel were threatened by atomic weapons, it would almost certainly defend itself.

35:43.380 --> 35:47.620
It would be very difficult for the US and Russia to stay out of that.

35:49.580 --> 35:55.580
I feel that disarmament is one of the most important questions we have facing us today.

35:56.900 --> 35:59.500
What's it going to take to affect something like that?

36:00.220 --> 36:10.720
Well, I don't know. I hope it doesn't take another disaster, another dropping of the bomb anywhere.

36:11.640 --> 36:18.920
Certainly it's going to have to take a revision of the basic attitudes of the politicians of the major powers.

36:19.680 --> 36:28.200
I don't believe they're asking the right questions because they seem to be asking, you know, how can we prevail? How can we become dominant?

36:29.120 --> 36:32.400
And the question that should be asked is how can we survive?

36:33.380 --> 36:47.420
Well, we are approaching global problems with village mentalities and ultimately this is one of the very great uses of science fiction.

36:47.560 --> 36:53.540
I think it expands the thought to see the real implications of problems that we get ourselves into.

36:56.040 --> 37:07.320
I guess in your books, since the people on a more primitive level, they can make mistakes and it's not quite, they're a little more forgiving than if we make mistakes now with the technology that we have.

37:08.260 --> 37:23.100
Yeah. I suppose it must have been a disaster for, say, a small village on the coast of Britain in early medieval times to have a whole gang of Viking ships

37:23.100 --> 37:33.880
sail up and burn the place to the ground. But even as disastrous as that was, it was only local.

37:35.300 --> 37:42.900
And the problem now is that our disasters tend to be awfully widespread. You just can't run away.

37:46.760 --> 37:57.260
We'll leave the morbid subjects for now. You talked earlier about all this information where the various tribes got started.

37:57.860 --> 38:03.100
So surely these three books aren't going to be the only ones that we will see in this milieu?

38:04.280 --> 38:19.820
No. The fourth book, which is called The Fall of the Shell, will be out in October. I'm working on a fifth right now, which is tentatively titled An Ambush of Shadows.

38:21.360 --> 38:37.340
And I have projected two more. I don't have it very elaborately plotted, but more or less. And I'm quite sure there will be more beyond that. But these are, this is as far as I see it very clearly.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.740
Will these be paperback or hardback releases?

38:42.740 --> 38:47.140
They'll be paperback as the first three.

38:49.380 --> 38:57.400
One thing the three books so far have had different cover art. It's not immediately apparent that they're a series.

38:58.420 --> 39:06.720
I was particularly struck by the cover, the Barbieri cover on the Dome of the Forest. I didn't know what it was until I read the passage towards the end.

39:06.720 --> 39:16.160
And obviously the artist had read the book or had read that section anyway, which is very rare. Were you pleased in general with the covers and what's your comments on that one in particular?

39:17.840 --> 39:24.840
Well, Daryl Sleet, who did the cover of The Breaking of North Wall, is also doing the cover of The Fall of the Shell.

39:26.460 --> 39:37.660
And when I first saw the cover of North Wall, I was really kind of shocked because it didn't look literally like my theory of what North Wall looked like.

39:38.440 --> 39:51.520
And the more I looked at it, the more pleased I became because it seems to me to be metaphorically a very good North Wall, a kind of soaring, defiant edifice.

39:52.600 --> 40:04.360
The end of the circle cover kind of disappointed me a little. I guess it's the section of the book which is set around the Ozare.

40:06.240 --> 40:17.060
And I think that it has proven the least successful of the three covers because as I found out, the cover sells the book many times.

40:19.360 --> 40:33.380
But I don't know. I like it because it metaphorically it does suggest the long trek to the west and the presence of the nuclear echoes from the past.

40:35.280 --> 40:50.560
The dome in the forest cover, though, did not really come about as you anticipated. It's kind of an odd story because when I was halfway through the book and I talked to my editor about what it was going to be of light,

40:50.560 --> 41:03.100
he told me, we have this cover sitting around here and we don't know what we're going to use it for. Would you mind if I send it to you to see if you like it for your book?

41:04.020 --> 41:15.300
And so he did. And I liked the cover very much. And so I actually wrote the cover into that scene near the end of the book.

41:17.060 --> 41:29.360
And I think that it fits the theme of the book very nicely. I'm really more and more pleased with it all the time because it's not a dome. It's not a dome blowing up or anything.

41:29.360 --> 41:53.920
It is, in essence, a kind of monument to the old Shumai spirit of, well, which recalls to me what Henry Thoreau says in his book, The Main Wood, that the truest user of the forest is the poet because he takes the best of the forest and leaves it as it was.

41:55.400 --> 42:21.360
And what Thore tries to tell Sark about his son is that, yes, he has died, but he has also affirmed the human spirit, which he has by getting his life for the preservation of others and the preservation of a way of life which he and they have thought of as being very fruitful.

42:21.360 --> 42:37.640
And one that kind of merges with things that uses the environment without destroying it or violating it. And the scene is right near a kind of microcosmic time of fire.

42:37.640 --> 42:56.320
That is, the modern weapons get inserted into, it's almost like anachronism, even though it is in the future, they get inserted into a primitive society and before long they get away again and destroy an entire valley, a beautiful valley.

42:58.660 --> 43:12.640
And the situation is corrected by those who have a much greater respect for the environment, one of which dies in the process. And that's part of what the book affirms.

43:12.640 --> 43:39.000
You see, in a sense I'm trying through the series to indicate, I hope realistically, but to indicate anyway that if social growth happens in conjunction with technological growth, we're going to do a whole lot better than if we simply give ourselves to technology and remain social dwarfs.

43:41.060 --> 43:44.920
I think this is one of the great dangers of our society today.

43:48.980 --> 44:01.060
At this point, I have three more questions on my list and we need to change our tape, just change the size. So if you'll bear with us a couple of minutes, we'll change it. Would you, if you'd like to take a break or anything, this would be a good time.
