coming up next is the science fiction radio show so stay with us

00:28.060 --> 00:33.880
this is the science fiction radio show a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy

00:36.520 --> 00:38.300
and here are your hosts

00:42.240 --> 00:49.440
this is daryl lane and david carson in addition to being an author terry carr is
one of science fiction's premier editors we asked him how he got hooked on

00:49.440 --> 00:59.300
science fiction back in the late 1940s oh that's that's kind of uh that's kind
of interesting most people don't believe this story but i actually discovered

00:59.300 --> 01:08.960
science fiction when i was wandering around a garbage dump there was a garbage
dump a few blocks from our house and i liked at that time when i was i guess

01:08.960 --> 01:17.800
about 10 or 11 or something sometimes friends and i would just go down and look
around to see what people were throwing out and one day among things we found

01:17.800 --> 01:27.440
people had thrown out were a couple of old bolt magazines from the year before
uh amazing stories and i think there was one amazing stories and one fantastic

01:27.440 --> 01:38.320
adventures those being companion magazine we grabbed those and brought them home
and i love them i got hooked right there after publishing a couple early novels

01:38.320 --> 01:49.940
and some short stories carr began his editing career at ace books we asked him
if he could tell us exactly what he did for ace yeah in 1964 i went to work for

01:49.940 --> 02:02.220
ace books as an editorial assistant which actually meant that that i was low man
on the totem pole where i was i was simply somebody who copy edited manuscripts

02:02.220 --> 02:13.140
went over them to to make sure the spelling was correct and things like that
there were no type of graphical errors and then proofread the uh the books

02:13.140 --> 02:21.840
before they actually got published to make sure once again that there were no
type of graphical errors in the type setting i would write blurbs cover copy

02:21.840 --> 02:32.020
kind of you know the things that are that are written on the front and back
covers of paperback books to try to get you to be interested enough in the book

02:32.020 --> 02:41.920
to buy it and at the same time i was reading a number of submissions that were
coming in if i saw something good i would pass it on to the editor it was donald

02:41.920 --> 02:42.340
wolheim

02:50.820 --> 02:59.160
carr says he then began to make suggestions for improving and expanding the ace
line of science fiction books and he worked his way up in the company ace books

02:59.160 --> 03:08.080
then did start doing a number of the things that i had suggested so that i began
getting this and that promotion and i think after about the first three years i

03:08.080 --> 03:19.580
became a senior editor there and began a series called the ace science fiction
specials which was very much a departure for for ace books in particular but for

03:19.580 --> 03:29.440
the entire field for that matter because it was specifically designed to publish
adult science fiction novels not not simply juvenile adventure but serious

03:29.440 --> 03:41.340
novels using the science fiction genre as its format and packaged uniformly so
that people would be able to recognize a new book in the series when it came out

03:41.340 --> 03:52.320
and packaged in such a way that uh you know it didn't have monsters chasing half
naked women on the covers we had very good artwork by a team of artists called

03:52.320 --> 04:03.440
leo and diane dylan who later won a hugo award and won two call the cot awards
and god knows what else they are extremely good artists i also began

04:03.440 --> 04:14.640
anthologizing very early when i started there don waldheim and i were
collaborating on an anthology in an annual anthology called world's best science

04:14.640 --> 04:28.960
fiction and uh i gradually branched out from that since i had begun to to have
my name on anthology i began to do others for double day and uh faucet books and

04:28.960 --> 04:39.960
so on and uh that was actually how i got my start doing anthologies with the
work that i was doing in his books some of the anthologies car does include the

04:39.960 --> 04:48.960
annual universe series of original science fiction which he originated in 1971
and the best science fiction of the year series which he began in 1972 we'll

04:48.960 --> 04:59.960
talk to terry carr next time about what it's like to edit anthologies of science
fiction this

04:59.960 --> 05:07.320

05:57.440 --> 06:01.340
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:17.160 --> 06:22.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.720
And here are your hosts.

06:30.840 --> 06:38.580
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Each year, Terry Carr edits two of the
best-known anthologies in science fiction. One is the Universe series, begun in

06:38.580 --> 06:45.780
1971, which is an anthology of original science fiction. We asked Carr the
difference to an author between selling his story to a monthly science fiction

06:45.780 --> 06:50.780
magazine or selling it to an anthology like Universe. There are all sorts of
differences.

06:54.180 --> 07:03.400
They're both artistic and monetary differences. For one thing, if you sell to a
magazine, then the money that you get from the magazine is simply the payment

07:03.400 --> 07:15.180
for that use of the story. If you sell it to an original anthology, that's going
into a book, and you get an advance payment. But after that, you get a share of

07:15.180 --> 07:24.140
the royalties. If the book sells well, then there will be additional earnings on
the book. And the individual authors will continue to make money for years

07:24.140 --> 07:35.560
thereafter, and indeed they do on Universe, because it does sell pretty well. So
your chances of making money on your story are at least as good, I would say, in

07:35.560 --> 07:46.380
the original anthologies as they are in the science fiction magazines. Aside
from that, there's also the fact that a lot of writers simply like to have their

07:46.380 --> 07:57.500
work appear in book form, because they know it's going to be around to be read
longer than a magazine will be. It'll stay in better shape, and it'll be in

07:57.500 --> 07:59.000
libraries and things like that.

08:07.100 --> 08:14.780
The best science fiction of the year, which Carr began in 1972 with Donald
Walheim, is a different sort of anthology. It consists of stories published in

08:14.780 --> 08:21.720
science fiction magazines during the year. Carr reads all the magazines, then
selects those stories he considers to be the best. But he says that there are

08:21.720 --> 08:28.300
certain problems that he has to solve when he actually starts putting the
stories together. I do want to be sure that there aren't too many stories that

08:28.300 --> 08:36.560
are downbeat and depressing, because that's just not fun to read. They may be
good stories individually, but you just string them all end to end, and they can

08:36.560 --> 08:47.900
actually seem not as good as they are. So I try to work on that kind of balance,
and I try to mix up the balance between longer stories and shorter stories,

08:48.340 --> 08:59.560
because people do like variety in that. And if it should ever happen, for
instance, I think the best 15 stories of the year, however many it takes, are

08:59.560 --> 09:08.400
all time travel stories, for instance. I'm not going to publish a whole book
full of time travel stories. That's just silly. Again, people would get tired of

09:08.400 --> 09:20.060
reading so many time travel stories in one book. So I try to mix up the themes,
too. Carr explains the particular needs an anthology fulfills. As best I know,

09:20.220 --> 09:32.040
an anthology fills a need for people who want to read good science fiction short
stories, novelettes, novellas, whatever. People who want to read something other

09:32.040 --> 09:41.280
than a novel. Probably people who want to have something that they can dip into
from time to time, rather than sitting down and reading the whole thing straight

09:41.280 --> 09:50.240
through, as they would a novel. There's a different psychology between reading
novels and short stories, and most people do prefer to read novels. They always

09:50.240 --> 10:02.360
sell better than anthologies or single-author short story collections. But there
are people who like the short stories. I do, for instance. And they're the

10:02.360 --> 10:12.960
people who buy these. On a repaint anthology, the attraction, I think, is that
these stories have been doubly screened. They're stories that were good enough

10:12.960 --> 10:22.460
in the first place to sell to the magazine. And then beyond that, they are the
best stories from the magazine. So the people who pick up an anthology can

10:22.460 --> 10:30.000
reasonably expect that that is going to contain more good stories than the
average issue of a science fiction magazine. This isn't always true. There are

10:30.000 --> 10:39.060
some very bad anthologies, and there are some very good issues of magazines. But
by and large, that is the case, I think. Terry Carr also writes fine science

10:39.060 --> 10:41.660
fiction. Next time, we'll talk to him about some of his own writing.

10:49.300 --> 10:57.180
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:57.180 --> 10:57.940
Odessa, Texas.

11:02.060 --> 11:02.340
Thank you.

11:39.260 --> 11:43.200
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:58.860 --> 12:04.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.600
And here are your hosts.

12:12.800 --> 12:20.060
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. Among the science fiction anthologies that
Terry Carr has edited over the years are the so-called specialized anthologies.

12:20.340 --> 12:28.120
These would be volumes of short stories with a particular theme uniting them.
For example, a book of short stories on robots or time travel. Carr has done

12:28.120 --> 12:36.440
many special anthologies. We spoke with him about a few of them. He explains the
rationale behind his 1966 anthology, Science Fiction for People Who Hate Science

12:36.440 --> 12:49.640
Fiction. That was my first anthology that I did under my own name and nobody
else's name. It was, I think, in fact, the second anthology I did right after it

12:49.640 --> 12:58.240
was the first world's best science fiction. And the idea on it was I wanted a
book that could be given to people who don't normally read science fiction, who

12:58.240 --> 13:10.320
think that they wouldn't like it. And I wanted, first, that the stories should
be good stories. And second, that the stories should be accessible to people who

13:10.320 --> 13:19.160
don't know the specialized language of science fiction. There are a whole lot of
assumptions that are just automatic in science fiction, and nobody bothers to

13:19.160 --> 13:26.160
explain them anymore. And so there are a lot of stories that are published these
days that really require a certain amount of background in reading science

13:26.160 --> 13:34.100
fiction in order to understand them. I mean, nobody stops to explain what a star
warp drive is anymore, because that gets a little bit tiresome after a while. We

13:34.100 --> 13:45.900
all know how a star warp drive works, more or less, or at least we think we do.
But to somebody who's never heard of that before, that can be kind of confusing.

13:46.460 --> 13:52.200
Or the intricacies of the

13:52.200 --> 14:06.760
moralities of robot behavior, or the strangeness of time paradoxes. Things like
that can be very confusing to someone first coming to science fiction. So the

14:06.760 --> 14:16.920
stories that I chose for that book were stories that had very simple, dramatic
ideas, that were very easy to understand to someone who was not used to science

14:16.920 --> 14:25.940
fiction right away, but that were also very good stories. A more recent
anthology is one carded for the Sierra Club, entitled Dream's Edge, Science

14:25.940 --> 14:34.840
Fiction Stories About the Planet Earth. The origin of that was that the Sierra
Club themselves decided they wanted to publish a science fiction anthology. And

14:34.840 --> 14:46.200
they looked around for someone to do it, and they eventually landed on me. The
main problem I had with that book was that there were too many stories in it

14:46.200 --> 14:52.700
that were downbeat and depressing. If you start writing about the ecology of
Earth, which is what the theme of that was,

14:55.560 --> 15:04.120
well, everything's going wrong these days, as you know. And nobody really has
any answers about what we can do about it. So even though I think all the

15:04.120 --> 15:14.120
stories in there are very good, there are only a few of them that hold out a
whole lot of hope. Most of them are about the problems and the ironies of

15:14.120 --> 15:24.060
messing around with the environment and so on. In 1978, Carr put together an
anthology many people consider his finest. It's called Classic Science Fiction,

15:24.180 --> 15:32.800
The First Golden Age. For this one, Carr chose stories from the years 1940 and
1942, a critical time in the development of modern science fiction. While Carr

15:32.800 --> 15:42.740
selected stories, he did something else that makes the volume of particular
interest. But at the same time, I also did a lot of research on the writers, on

15:42.740 --> 15:50.940
the editors, the publishing companies, the artists, and so forth. The conditions
under which they worked, how much money they were actually able to make. And I

15:50.940 --> 16:00.000
wrote a great deal of introductory material, background material, about the
writers and what they were doing, how they came to write each individual story.

16:00.360 --> 16:11.280
And I think the anthology itself contains a number of just classic stories. It's
a basic anthology for anybody's science fiction library. But in addition to

16:11.280 --> 16:20.140
that, that background material is fascinating. It tells a whole lot of things
about how things happened and why they happened. And it also tells a number of

16:20.140 --> 16:28.860
pretty amusing stories about things that went on behind the scenes. I really
enjoyed doing the book. We'll have more with Terry Carr next time.

16:36.160 --> 16:44.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:44.000 --> 16:44.760
Odessa, Texas.

17:18.060 --> 17:18.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show.

17:36.260 --> 17:40.200
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:55.980 --> 18:01.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.560
And here are your hosts.

18:09.580 --> 18:18.140
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Editor and author Terry Carr has published
three science fiction novels. The first two, Warlord of Kor and Invasion from

18:18.140 --> 18:26.600
2500, go back to the early 1960s and are potboilers in the pulp tradition. But
his most recent novel is a different thing entirely. It's a tightly constructed

18:26.600 --> 18:35.400
work with symbolic and allegorical depth. Entitled Cirque, it was published in
1977. Carr tells us where the idea for the book originated. Cirque is actually

18:35.400 --> 18:48.640
the Bay Area, in some sense anyway, not literally. But the fact is that I live
in the hills of Oakland, in the East Bay. And there's a drive along the ridge of

18:48.640 --> 19:02.320
the hills. And I was up there one evening just at dusk, when the light is such
that the bay itself, which you can look down on, and you'll see San Francisco

19:02.320 --> 19:13.960
and Marin County across the bay, and San Jose to the south, and Berkeley and
Oakland in front of you, and a lot of water in the middle. But at a particular

19:13.960 --> 19:23.340
time of evening, that water simply turned black. And I was up there looking at
that, and I thought, my God, you can't even tell at the bay, it looks like a

19:23.340 --> 19:33.540
gigantic hole in the ground. And immediately I thought, what would a city be
like if it would build around a gigantic shaft into the earth like that? What

19:33.540 --> 19:40.820
effect might that kind of physical environment have on the psychology of the
people who lived in that city?

19:47.860 --> 19:55.260
Carr explores the psychology and destiny of various inhabitants of the city,
Sirk, during an unusual day's occurrences. On that day, some monsters rise out

19:55.260 --> 20:02.340
of the abyss the city is built around. The monsters are huge and ominous, and
the reaction of Carr's characters to them forms the basis of the book. Near the

20:02.340 --> 20:10.040
end of the novel, the monsters, after threatening the inhabitants of Sirk, turn
into flowers. This episode, along with many others in the book, suggests a

20:10.040 --> 20:19.080
symbolic intent on Carr's part. We asked him if there was deliberate symbolism
in the book. Oh yes, that is definitely the most important. I knew the general

20:19.080 --> 20:30.500
outline of the story. I just didn't know the specifics of who was going to do
what at which time and where they were going to be, and so on. The symbolism is

20:30.500 --> 20:43.600
built into the whole concept of the story. And I tried not to make that show too
much on the top. I wanted the surface to be a story that was interesting in and

20:43.600 --> 20:52.140
of itself, because I don't believe that symbolism itself should ever try to
carry a story. That bores me to tears. On the other hand, if you have a good

20:52.140 --> 21:05.060
story up front, and beneath that story is symbolism, preferably emotional
symbolism, not just intellectual cuteness, I think that strengthens the story a

21:05.060 --> 21:05.540
good deal.

21:15.440 --> 21:25.980
Carr explains why he chose the title, Cirque, for the novel. The book, of
course, is about a city which is built around a gigantic chasm into the ground.

21:27.600 --> 21:42.600
And so the city is named Cirque, which is French for circle, and has other
connotations too. It also, for instance, it's the French word for circus. And it

21:42.600 --> 21:55.620
was kind of a circus. There were a whole lot of things, strange things going on
at once in the book. And the construction of the book is circular. It starts at

21:55.620 --> 22:07.120
dawn on one day, and it goes ahead to finish at dawn the next day. And it
finishes at the same place in the city where it began, with the same characters

22:07.120 --> 22:18.160
there. So in all those ways, Cirque or circle was the perfect title for the
book. The only thing it really had going against it is that nobody knows how to

22:18.160 --> 22:21.980
pronounce it. We'll have more from Terry Carr next time.

22:29.220 --> 22:37.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin

The Science Fiction Radio Show,

23:26.680 --> 23:30.620

23:46.380 --> 23:51.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:54.380 --> 23:56.000
And here are your hosts.

23:59.960 --> 24:08.180
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. Science fiction author Terry Carr is noted
for his aliens. One of his better-known creations is the mysterious millipede in

24:08.180 --> 24:14.440
the novel Cirque. But he's also written a number of short stories with
fascinating aliens in them. The Dance of the Changer and the Three is one of

24:14.440 --> 24:23.140
those stories. Carr provides an explanation of the premise behind the story. I
had been reading, of all people, Roger Zelazny. We seem to be mentioning him a

24:23.140 --> 24:36.220
lot here. And Roger at that time, this was in the late 60s, was working a lot
with mythology in his science fiction. And I got interested in his work. I loved

24:36.220 --> 24:55.440
his work. And I was always interested in mythology itself. And it occurred to me
that mythology tells a whole lot about the fears, the hopes, the beliefs of

24:55.440 --> 25:05.900
humanity. And that, indeed, if any alien creatures ever came to this planet and
wanted to find out something about what makes humanity tick, they could do far

25:05.900 --> 25:16.180
worse than to study some of our myths. And I suddenly just, there was a little
clectic was on your head, and I turned that around and said, Well, I like to

25:16.180 --> 25:24.800
think and write about aliens. And it's very difficult to write about an alien
from the inside, because I personally believe that aliens are inexplicable to

25:24.800 --> 25:36.540
us, that we're never going to understand them fully. So I thought, possibly a
good way of dealing with the portrayal of an alien or an entire alien race would

25:36.540 --> 25:46.640
be to do it circuitously by telling an alien myth. And that is exactly what the
dance of the changer in the three is, of course, is an alien myth. And the myth

25:46.640 --> 25:50.020
itself is supposed to tell you a lot about the psychology of the race.

25:55.560 --> 26:03.160
We never do understand the psychology of the aliens in the story. The human
narrator describes certain actions and some of the dialogue of the aliens, but

26:03.160 --> 26:11.140
the significance of all of this is never clear. The climax of the story occurs
when the aliens, who are creatures of pure energy, inexplicably destroy almost

26:11.140 --> 26:18.020
all the humans on their planet. And they do it without malice, while they are
performing one of the ritual dances that belong to their mythology. We asked

26:18.020 --> 26:29.440
Carr if there was perhaps some reason for this massacre, something we missed in
reading the story. I don't know, frankly. And I don't want to know. The method

26:29.440 --> 26:45.300
that I used in writing that was, since I believed the aliens would be totally un
-understandable to us, every time the story that I was telling became too

26:45.300 --> 26:56.900
comprehensible, I would write something that made no sense whatever. So that the
myth itself, of course, is kind of a self-canceling myth. If you actually

26:56.900 --> 27:05.280
analyze it, there's a certain circularity to it. It has a dramatic coherence.

27:07.120 --> 27:21.300
But it's not a story that we would ever tell about ourselves that would resonate
with the human psyche. And I wanted to end the story with something totally

27:21.300 --> 27:32.280
inexplicable happening, just to underscore and emphasize the fact that these
creatures were aliens. And I wanted it to be something that none of us was going

27:32.280 --> 27:39.920
to understand. And that meant, inevitably, that I had to be sure I didn't
understand it either. One of the points of the story, then, seems to be that

27:39.920 --> 27:48.780
humans could never understand an alien species. We asked Carr if this
interpretation was correct. Yeah, that was the basic point. Yeah, I've been

27:48.780 --> 27:56.720
trying to make that point in a number of my stories. There's another one that I
wrote earlier called Top Friends, which makes much the same point, but not quite

27:56.720 --> 28:04.400
as dramatically as that does. Carr's premise in The Dance of the Changer in the
Three is an interesting one, very different from the common science fiction

28:04.400 --> 28:08.980
notions of aliens as either hostile bug-eyed monsters or as creatures we can
become close to.
