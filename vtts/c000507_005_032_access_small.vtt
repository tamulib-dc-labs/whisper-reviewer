00:01.220 --> 00:08.280
I screwed it up. I wasn't proud of it. I could try to get rid of it. But anyway, it's not that I'm a gourmet cook. I hate that word.

00:08.680 --> 00:18.180
It's just that if I eat something someplace and I like it, I like to figure out how it's done and try to duplicate it as well.

00:18.620 --> 00:19.380
What about you?

00:20.020 --> 00:24.960
Oh, no. I was just wondering when I read some of your works and some of the food you come up with on various planets.

00:25.620 --> 00:26.160
Oh, well.

00:26.360 --> 00:26.980
Yeah, I get hungry.

00:26.980 --> 00:33.340
I couldn't. A lot of that junk I wouldn't know where. I can't read potatoes.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.920
Yeah. Okay. He's got the tape running, so I'll just get through these other questions. So we're being taped again.

00:38.320 --> 00:38.480
Yeah.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.920
Do you sail well over in Europe?

00:42.020 --> 00:48.940
Well, it varies. Essentially, yes, I do. Especially in the Netherlands, Holland.

00:50.520 --> 01:01.100
Then I do well in France and in Germany, England, and less extent Italy and in Spain, I don't think there's...

01:01.100 --> 01:04.200
Nobody does too well. It's the Portuguese group, but it's nice.

01:05.340 --> 01:10.480
Best I've Sello is in Holland. Next to all about the same.

01:10.480 --> 01:16.900
Sweet or the Scandinavia, nobody does very well up there either. They all read English.

01:18.080 --> 01:25.600
There's very few... they're not breaking the market for translations. Translations in Swedish, maybe.

01:26.980 --> 01:32.220
A lot of English books over there. Anybody who likes science fiction generally gets an English.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.640
Well, have you been translated into a number of languages then?

01:36.640 --> 01:41.640
Yeah. Yeah. Just all the usual ones, anyway.

01:44.460 --> 01:55.200
I don't become translated into Mugarek or Tasmanian or anything like that, but just usual languages.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.980
I don't know if I've sold anything in Russia or not. I just don't know.

02:00.080 --> 02:12.160
The pirates, you know, they might have... I suspect not though. Too much of a non-collectivist, I think, is sort of...

02:12.160 --> 02:27.800
It also, I don't attack the institutions of the United States, if you want to sell in Russia, then you have to be very stern, critical of conventional institutions.

02:28.820 --> 02:38.460
Rather than attacking, I kind of admire the world of the United States. It's amazingly well how well it functions.

02:39.120 --> 02:53.700
Obvious drawbacks, obvious discrepancies, but when you think how complicated this country we live in is, how many people are all individuals?

02:55.900 --> 03:11.900
Not necessarily working against each other, but in competition with each other. It's amazing how many happy people the system is able to keep going.

03:12.820 --> 03:24.000
That's enough to say that I am endorsing every aspect of life, obviously. But I still sometimes wonder about it.

03:25.760 --> 03:31.000
It just seems that... Well, that's enough of that.

03:31.080 --> 03:40.580
Yeah, okay. In the 60s you did some mystery writing. In fact, I think you're the only person who's ever won both the Hugo and the Edgar Award

03:40.580 --> 03:42.540
for science fiction and the Edgar for mysteries.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.340
Paul Anderson did.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.500
Paul Anderson did?

03:45.780 --> 03:45.880
Yeah.

03:46.020 --> 03:48.240
Oh, I didn't know that. We talked to him last year.

03:48.520 --> 03:48.640
Yeah.

03:49.360 --> 03:54.160
I was going to ask you, what made you try the mystery?

03:55.080 --> 04:04.440
Well, what I read, the fun... That's the stuff I read. I don't ever read any so-called science fiction. That's the last thing I've read.

04:05.140 --> 04:16.780
But I don't even read much mysteries. But all about every three years I may go on a kind of a mystery kick, pick up maybe four or five of them, go through them.

04:17.640 --> 04:28.700
And then I've done for a while. But it's kind of an artificial field like science fiction is, in a way.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.540
Let's scratch that, Bill. Take that out.

04:32.740 --> 04:32.900
Okay.

04:35.080 --> 04:40.680
It's artificial is the wrong word. And if I try to explain myself, I'd be talking too long.

04:42.320 --> 04:55.620
But anyway, I do like... I like mysteries. In fact, I do some more of them at the time. I don't do them because there's none of money in them. I think for money in science fiction there's mysteries.

04:56.960 --> 05:03.660
Well, isn't some of your science fiction work, say, the Magnus Rite Off or the Kurt Gerson stuff, those are almost detective kind of stories.

05:03.940 --> 05:22.920
They almost are. And then I was using a mural head full, the effectuated. And I want to do some more about mural head full and have him a detective or a free agent or something like that.

05:25.280 --> 05:34.940
It's like a lack of detective. In fact, that's how I got mural head full started because I wanted to have a... I wasn't so pleased with...

05:34.940 --> 05:42.920
Magnus Rite Off was okay for his time, but I wanted to get something just a little bit different. And so I got mural head full.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.920
And if I have time, I want to do some more. I've got...

05:50.160 --> 06:03.500
Well, anyway, I was just going to say that I was going to confront mural head full with the task of discovering the perpetrator of a crime which had not been committed in an unknown world at an unknown time.

06:04.220 --> 06:11.400
And nobody knows why. That was a problem he was going to face. Somebody was going to say, that's something I want you to do.

06:12.320 --> 06:19.520
It solved this problem. And I went to doubt, actually, believe it or not.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.460
In other words, if you have time to write it, you'll write something.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.940
Yeah, I've tried to write it. I'll write it.

06:25.120 --> 06:35.700
Yeah. Okay, I've noticed in the last few years, I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I've noticed an increasing critical attention to your work.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.600
Is there more recognition on the...

06:38.600 --> 06:39.860
Yeah, I've noticed that, too.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.340
What's your reaction to that?

06:41.700 --> 06:46.200
Well, every knock is a boost. More than better.

06:47.000 --> 06:47.280
Okay.

06:50.900 --> 06:59.580
In other words, if I get some critical attention, I'll start selling more. I'll make more money, which is the name of the game.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.860
Yeah, I guess so. Do you...

07:05.600 --> 07:14.020
Well, you certainly must have some desire to be in the far future, to be remembered and studied, or you just want to be noted as a freelance writer who made a living?

07:16.480 --> 07:16.880
Well...

07:16.880 --> 07:17.460
I mean, Fane.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.660
Obviously, if I have to take my choice, I'll take the first one.

07:28.780 --> 07:29.300
But...

07:30.540 --> 07:39.760
The way I'd like to be remembered is as a very rich writer who changed the way that people perceive the world.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.660
I'm just joking, of course. Got a label out of the joke.

07:45.140 --> 07:45.960
I like that.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.820
But I like the idea of being remembered as a very wealthy writer.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.480
Okay.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.780
Do you have any movie nibbles? That's the way to get wealthy.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.920
Yeah, I know. Actually, I just had some just the other day.

08:04.240 --> 08:08.400
But it's so tenuous. In fact, several nibbles, in particular.

08:10.160 --> 08:17.720
In fact, we're not going to think about a little bit. There's one from France on Bad Rattles. I don't know if you know that story or not.

08:19.740 --> 08:26.680
But to my terror, I find that I have been horror and agony. I find that I find a way all right through the thing.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.800
I make a movie on that. In France, I am out. I don't get built.

08:32.400 --> 08:38.120
So, in England, there's some kind of vague nibble on something else.

08:39.400 --> 08:44.620
And then, just the other day, I was talking to some people from Hollywood. There's some nibbles on something else.

08:46.580 --> 08:58.620
And then, again, as soon as I get to finish this thing, I'm going to start working on a treat without a expense story, which will be deep-seated daily.

09:00.580 --> 09:05.260
I have a... My son and I, actually, together, we have to take a boat.

09:06.200 --> 09:10.840
And we're trying to get out to sea, sail at least on the South Pacific Island.

09:14.300 --> 09:23.560
And I've got the idea for a story, a sped story on this boat, and I'd like to see if I can make some money on it.

09:25.400 --> 09:33.640
Okay, now, you've mentioned this throughout the talk. I just want to sort of draw this together now for your future plans for science fiction fantasy works.

09:33.700 --> 09:37.760
You're going to do some more kugel, maybe. And you have just finished that long?

09:38.780 --> 09:41.080
I just finished the first graph. Just finished it.

09:41.300 --> 09:42.980
Okay, on that medieval-type book you said?

09:43.620 --> 09:51.100
Yeah, it's medieval fantasy. It's like... It's not King Arthur's stuff.

09:51.100 --> 10:01.560
It predates the legendary... Well, the whole Arthurian stuff. It's, say, 150 years before this.

10:02.400 --> 10:10.040
And it's kind of a similar atmosphere, but all the difference. Similar but different.

10:10.040 --> 10:25.460
But it's that kind of a locale. That of the Arthurian times, let's say. But it's got nothing to do with King Arthur's, nor any holy grails or anything like that.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.260
Totally different.

10:27.740 --> 10:29.780
And you may write some more Muroheadsel, too.

10:30.320 --> 10:35.420
Yeah. If I get time, time is just a factor in all these things.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.980
See, there's something else I wanted to do. I kind of forgot what it was then.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.180
New course hall will come to me now.

10:46.600 --> 10:51.620
There's Alastor. There's lots of Alastor. I've got 3,000 planets there to deal with.

10:51.700 --> 10:52.040
Right.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.380
And keep me busy a little bit.

10:55.740 --> 11:00.000
Oh, there's lots of stuff to be done. All you have to do is just get started on it.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.320
Yeah, okay. Listen, I just have maybe two more here.

11:05.480 --> 11:10.960
My favorite story of yours, I don't know what you can say about this. I'm not even sure if I have a question on it, but is green magic?

11:13.620 --> 11:24.620
I've always been fascinated with that. I've never read a story which, I don't know, gives the feeling of something remote, alien, you know, the green realm that you write about.

11:24.620 --> 11:31.620
I detected a... I was going to ask you, my question was going to be this, it sounds dumb, but I was going to ask you if you're an optimistic individual because...

11:32.640 --> 11:33.600
Yeah, I've been optimistic.

11:34.760 --> 11:39.940
Okay, and in all of your work, you seem to have a great zest for life, you know, an experience and so forth. It's very evident.

11:40.080 --> 11:46.760
But in some of your works, too, like in Green Magic, I detect almost an underlying tone of melancholy or sadness.

11:46.760 --> 12:05.340
Well, it's hard to be... it's hard to be a continual optimist and it's not a very pleasant way to live to be a pessimist.

12:05.520 --> 12:14.920
I much prefer being an optimist, but then on the other hand, it's evident to all of us that life is basically tragic.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.300
You just get things going and then you're dead.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.940
There's a... that's hard to refute.

12:26.000 --> 12:35.760
And it's hard to be an optimism in the face of this rimmed, dark reality underneath, you know.

12:36.320 --> 12:43.480
But as far as living from day to day, you might as well enjoy your life because you know what comes after.

12:44.440 --> 12:49.840
Yeah, the way I connect that to Green Magic is that the protagonist, I forget his name, it's Harry, I can't remember,

12:51.900 --> 12:55.840
he is never again going to be happy on Earth after he's experienced the Green Realm.

12:56.700 --> 13:09.920
It's just... essentially the story is... it just remarks quietly that if you're able to achieve all your goals easily,

13:10.860 --> 13:12.360
there's nothing to use but anymore.

13:13.540 --> 13:20.880
I guess that... I don't want to put it into words like that too much because I did not have that in mind when I was writing it.

13:20.960 --> 13:25.980
It was just... in fact, I wrote the thing, damn dog, it's yelling, it's somebody coming in.

13:27.980 --> 13:32.960
I wrote the story without me... I bought mine just the way the story came.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.500
That's the way it turned out.

13:36.500 --> 13:45.800
In other words, I did not sit down and say I'm going to write the story about the futility of dreams or the horror of human existence.

13:46.060 --> 13:51.000
I did not sit down and just write a story about Green Magic. That's what happened.

13:52.520 --> 14:02.340
Okay, the last one I had, my friend here is... we sort of collect some of the works that the Special Lee houses put out, like Underwood Miller and so forth.

14:02.920 --> 14:09.020
He wonders, do you know of anybody who might have one of those copies of Dying Earth and Underwood Miller did that they would sell?

14:10.400 --> 14:12.680
I don't know.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.540
Just offhand we thought.

14:15.640 --> 14:20.840
I might have some extra ones, but I... Tim probably might have.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.340
Tim, I do what he asked him was...

14:25.240 --> 14:28.580
Yeah? Oh, okay. I might use it most of the time.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.180
Yeah, what is it about then?

14:31.180 --> 14:35.000
He was raised by a teenage kid. He watched me off the phone.

14:35.260 --> 14:38.180
You think if he wrote Tim Underwood a letter and just asked him if he had any more extras?

14:38.380 --> 14:42.160
No, I asked him once while he said, well...

14:43.160 --> 14:50.420
You know, he says I should keep these things because they go up and appreciate what he says.

14:51.220 --> 14:59.000
I just don't have people writing me for them and I just send them out and I don't know whether he has any more or not. Why don't you give him a call?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.160
Yeah, okay, we will.

15:01.900 --> 15:02.840
752-7902-0.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.420
752-7902-0.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.980
What's the area code? Where is he? Back in Pennsylvania?

15:10.200 --> 15:12.000
Oh, I thought he was out there in the east.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.860
No, that's Chuck Miller back in the east.

15:13.940 --> 15:14.900
Okay, okay.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.260
Yeah, it's just... he was there in Francisco.

15:17.500 --> 15:17.920
Yeah, okay.

15:20.140 --> 15:26.000
I might have some downstairs. I don't know how many I got. I might have one or two. I just don't know.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.180
You must have been half your life signing some of those.

15:29.140 --> 15:30.360
I've signed a lot of, yeah.

15:34.140 --> 15:43.560
Yeah, I've taken it enough of your time, Mr. Vance. We really appreciate this. What we do now, this show probably won't go on until after the first of the year. We tape way ahead.

15:44.000 --> 15:53.120
So when we get it edited, we will send you copies of the tape and look forward to your future work with great anticipation.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.660
All right. Thank you very much.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.200
And we appreciate the time very much.

15:56.260 --> 15:56.680
Try to go home.

15:56.800 --> 15:57.220
Thank you.

15:58.080 --> 15:58.360
Bye.
