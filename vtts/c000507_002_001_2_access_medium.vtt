00:05.080 --> 00:06.700
Okay, tape is running again.

00:11.800 --> 00:15.420
Okay, I've counted the books that I think you've got published so far and I've come

00:15.420 --> 00:17.520
up with about 12 or 13, is that right?

00:17.840 --> 00:19.540
I would imagine that's about right.

00:19.900 --> 00:23.740
Okay, I think I've read everything that you had out at the present time.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.260
My personal favorite is the Fated Son trilogy.

00:29.740 --> 00:33.200
You've already made one comment on that which sort of answered one of my questions,

00:33.740 --> 00:35.140
which is it pronounced the Marie?

00:35.600 --> 00:36.180
Marie, yes.

00:36.260 --> 00:40.720
Marie, if you'd modeled them in anybody, any cultures, you've already answered that one.

00:44.300 --> 00:49.820
I guess what I'll ask you is what do you as their creator or Duncan,

00:50.660 --> 00:54.580
the human who lives with them, what do you admire about them?

00:56.220 --> 01:07.400
I think that for one thing, about the Marie, I think I admire their steadfastness,

01:09.220 --> 01:17.020
their ability to face time itself with tranquility in the sense

01:17.020 --> 01:26.200
that they can take the long view, which is a thing that is absolutely necessary in my mind

01:26.200 --> 01:31.180
for civilized survival, mind I don't say just survival, but civilized survival.

01:32.080 --> 01:37.700
It's their ability to look down the centuries and see consequences.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.920
The Marie sense of time is a very strange thing.

01:43.440 --> 01:49.300
A Marie always lives now, and that now is a composite of the past,

01:50.480 --> 01:53.020
current events, and the future simultaneously.

01:54.600 --> 02:02.560
They do not view time as the modern American does, which is more or less a set of beads

02:02.560 --> 02:08.380
on the string that we can snip off any tail of the string that seems inconvenient to us.

02:09.180 --> 02:12.440
The Marie concept of the universe is holistic.

02:14.920 --> 02:24.300
And their ability to perceive that all of time impacts on every moment that they live,

02:24.760 --> 02:33.400
I think is one of the things that I most enjoy about that species.

02:35.040 --> 02:35.760
What about Duncan?

02:35.820 --> 02:39.920
Why does he choose to give up his, in a sense, give up his humanity and become one of them?

02:41.220 --> 02:46.340
Well, the character of Duncan himself, you will recall that he has no past.

02:47.820 --> 02:54.500
He was born in the war, probably an orphan, very early in life,

02:55.000 --> 03:03.860
transferred to a state nursery, and brought up to fight, essentially to pay for his existence

03:03.860 --> 03:10.100
by becoming a soldier in a war that had gone on much longer than made sense for anyone.

03:12.420 --> 03:18.180
When he encountered the Marie, he is a very simple man in many ways.

03:18.420 --> 03:23.600
He's highly educated in his narrow field of specialization.

03:24.220 --> 03:25.460
The state saw to that.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.640
But when he encounters the Marie, he cannot sympathize with the diplomats,

03:31.660 --> 03:33.440
with anything else that's going on.

03:33.860 --> 03:41.660
But what he considered to be another soldier from his viewpoint, with a soldier's morality,

03:42.700 --> 03:44.800
he could comprehend and respect that.

03:46.240 --> 03:51.940
That respect then led him to a deeper understanding of the people.

03:53.860 --> 03:58.880
To me, one of the more pathetic things in the story is Duncan himself,

03:58.880 --> 04:06.640
who is attacking the Regal Library, attempting, a completely uneducated man in many ways,

04:07.280 --> 04:11.420
attempting to understand the culture that he has just contributed to destroy.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.340
And he becomes obsessed with it.

04:17.540 --> 04:24.720
He finally conceives it as a moral responsibility of his own, and thereby falls into a trap,

04:26.140 --> 04:34.060
because his humanity, his sense of moral responsibility, his feeling of blame for what has happened,

04:34.960 --> 04:37.420
leads him to attempt to save these people.

04:38.580 --> 04:48.520
And once he has done that, he discovers that if he remains what he is, namely human,

04:49.820 --> 04:56.500
that will as effectively destroy them as any bomb, any attack could do.

04:58.140 --> 05:10.840
So his final sacrifice in a sort of a redemptive sense is that he finally agrees

05:10.840 --> 05:18.040
that he will no longer attempt to be human, that he begins to try to be something else.

05:18.520 --> 05:24.460
Even in that, there is a considerable hazard, because if the transition is not complete,

05:24.960 --> 05:30.260
he may end up by contaminating the culture, which to the Marie and their way

05:30.260 --> 05:32.180
of life is a very, very serious thing.

05:32.820 --> 05:40.640
But it is a voluntary and conscious decision that is effectively his personal suicide.

05:42.580 --> 05:46.400
And he takes it because he feels responsible for what has happened.

05:46.400 --> 05:54.700
Okay. I think it was in the second book of the series, there was a particular episode

05:55.980 --> 06:00.400
that I guess of all your writing, this I think got to me the most.

06:01.380 --> 06:02.720
Is the game called Shonai?

06:03.160 --> 06:03.600
Shonai.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.120
Shonai. Shonai.

06:05.660 --> 06:08.460
When Aom is shit, making the jumps back to the Marie home world.

06:09.220 --> 06:13.000
And I guess it's Niyun is or Niyun is teaching him the Shonai game.

06:15.260 --> 06:20.900
I was fascinated enough about that to wonder if there was any model behind that particular game

06:20.900 --> 06:22.680
and its purpose or its intention.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.600
I suppose that if I thought very far back into my childhood, I could think of games

06:30.600 --> 06:32.020
that I played that were similar.

06:32.680 --> 06:33.480
Rhythm games.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.020
Games of coordination.

06:37.860 --> 06:43.300
The game to the Marie is a form of literature.

06:44.860 --> 06:48.880
It contains the relationships of the people.

06:49.640 --> 06:55.160
And as such, I suppose that a great deal of it was made up completely out of whole cloth.

06:55.900 --> 07:09.260
Because from simply the initial thought of a rhythm game, the original concept as I had it

07:09.600 --> 07:11.260
was simply a rhythm or a chant.

07:12.460 --> 07:19.400
And beyond that, the concept grew as my understanding of the Marie increased just

07:19.400 --> 07:21.780
by working with that sort of culture.

07:22.820 --> 07:29.840
Until I began to realize that if you're playing this thing as dangerously as they play it,

07:30.980 --> 07:35.760
that it's going to make a great deal of difference in terms of the weaknesses

07:35.760 --> 07:37.120
and strengths of the players.

07:38.020 --> 07:45.200
It's going to have a great deal to say about the interdependencies and independences,

07:45.200 --> 07:48.800
if you will, of the individuals within the community.

07:49.350 --> 07:50.680
Who can play with whom?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.380
Who sets opposite whom?

07:53.400 --> 07:54.580
Who is allied to whom?

07:56.960 --> 08:03.440
And it also has to do with the philosophy of the people, which again has to do

08:03.440 --> 08:11.020
with the great now, the ability to turn loose of a thing and to live for the moment

08:11.020 --> 08:13.460
which stretches in all directions in time.

08:15.960 --> 08:21.180
To, as Neon puts it, open the hand and let go, which is one

08:21.180 --> 08:23.360
of the hardest things that Duncan has to learn.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.100
Okay, one more question on those books.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.700
It seemed to me that you did leave an opening at the end of the third volume,

08:32.700 --> 08:36.340
and I wanted to ask if you perhaps could have any plans to continue with Marie.

08:38.820 --> 08:41.760
Yes, there is a possibility of that.

08:41.760 --> 08:49.520
I have, I had to work so intensely with that culture for quite a while that I do not

08:49.520 --> 08:53.480
at present trust myself to tamper with it.

08:55.840 --> 09:00.220
I think that like the Morgane book, there is a possibility of my going back

09:00.220 --> 09:01.540
and working with it again.

09:02.380 --> 09:05.500
As a matter of fact, I already have sort of the germ of an idea,

09:06.840 --> 09:09.740
but it will have to gather moss for quite a while.

09:10.920 --> 09:17.080
I want to make sure that if I disturb them again, it's for a worthy cause,

09:18.240 --> 09:24.240
and not just to write a book to be a sequel, but to be sure that it is the kind

09:24.240 --> 09:26.420
of story that could only be told with Marie.

09:27.140 --> 09:30.680
That's one of the penalties of working with cultures.

09:30.900 --> 09:35.820
You know, you lose the ability to say, well, I would like to write a story,

09:35.820 --> 09:38.520
and I think I will write a story with these people.

09:39.400 --> 09:46.940
When the story that I told is wound as deeply into the culture and history of a species

09:47.740 --> 09:53.180
as the Faded Sun was, you have to come up with another kind of story

09:53.180 --> 09:55.260
which could only be told about that culture.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.580
Okay, let me go into one more work.

10:02.620 --> 10:06.620
What was the impetus behind the short stories in the book Sunfall?

10:06.620 --> 10:08.880
It's so different than the other things you've done.

10:08.980 --> 10:11.600
I wondered what was behind that.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.920
Well, it's different perhaps than other things which have come to light.

10:16.140 --> 10:19.340
But I think that I traveled a great deal about the world.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.340
I've been in, well, let me think.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.280
I've been to Rome and to London.

10:28.140 --> 10:32.000
I've never been in Paris, actually, but I've been all over France.

10:35.980 --> 10:38.400
And Istanbul, which didn't make it in.

10:38.440 --> 10:42.040
I was going to do an Istanbul story, and then yet.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.280
I've never been to Beijing either.

10:47.440 --> 10:55.080
But basically, I began thinking about the organism of a city as an entity.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.940
The concept of a city having a personality different than all other things.

11:03.480 --> 11:08.080
You go to New York, and you could not mistake it for Rome.

11:09.980 --> 11:13.880
Just the composite of people living there gives it a different flavor,

11:15.920 --> 11:19.840
a different taste, a different style than any other place.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.740
Also, to a certain extent, I suppose it's psychologically related to the Fated Sun.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.760
Because when I was thinking about another species at the end of time, I wondered,

11:34.840 --> 11:36.120
what about our own?

11:36.660 --> 11:37.700
What about the Earth?

11:38.420 --> 11:44.020
When we're very, very old, what sort of things might we preserve as our artifacts?

11:45.700 --> 11:51.800
And the idea occurred to me that one of the things that humanity has created,

11:53.440 --> 11:56.220
which for all we know may be unique to humanity.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.540
Is this concept we call city.

12:02.560 --> 12:12.160
And consequently, the story arose with the cities differentiating from each other

12:12.160 --> 12:15.400
to such an extent that we return to the age of the city state.

12:16.220 --> 12:23.040
Civilization is slowly being canceled just because of the interval of distance and time

12:23.040 --> 12:25.820
and the difference of culture over the years.

12:28.640 --> 12:33.900
The idea of the city, the idea behind that book would have been conceived before you wrote

12:33.900 --> 12:37.060
the short stories, or did you write the short stories individually and then sort

12:37.060 --> 12:38.720
of think of a way to put them together?

12:38.980 --> 12:44.340
Well, actually, the initial story in the whole piece was the Rome story.

12:46.460 --> 12:53.120
George Sither's, then with Isaac Asimov's magazines, had shown me a cover

12:53.820 --> 12:58.260
which contained a fantastical number of elements.

12:59.960 --> 13:05.260
And sort of on a bad ask if I could write a short story based on that.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.420
Because back in the old days, you know, writers did use to write stories

13:09.420 --> 13:11.480
to fit the covers rather than the other way around.

13:12.900 --> 13:19.300
So I undertook it and George's comment on the story was about that,

13:19.300 --> 13:23.180
that most editors make on my short stories, which was this seems to be connected

13:23.180 --> 13:28.340
to something else, probably the affliction of novelists, you see.

13:29.900 --> 13:33.100
But I wrote that one and it lay about a while.

13:33.820 --> 13:39.080
And then, you know, at the world conventions, they're always asking you to do readings

13:39.080 --> 13:41.160
from your work and I didn't have one.

13:41.860 --> 13:48.320
So I sat down and wrote The Only Death in the City as sort of inspired

13:48.320 --> 13:54.300
for the Rome story and that one sat in Paris so that I had something to read

13:54.300 --> 13:56.040
at the world convention, which I did.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.600
Then it suddenly struck me that I had two stories which were obviously connected

14:00.600 --> 14:09.120
to something else and finally, it dawned on me that I could do several more of them

14:09.120 --> 14:13.880
since they were of an untidy length and actually have a book.

14:16.340 --> 14:24.020
So out of all that broth of thinking about the world's old age and the character of cities

14:24.020 --> 14:30.900
and the fact that I had two of them in hand, I sat down and wrote several of them right

14:30.900 --> 14:32.400
in the string, one after the other.

14:34.580 --> 14:38.720
Okay. I got the impression with some of those stories, for instance, the Paris one

14:38.720 --> 14:42.200
and the Moscow one, that you may have consciously been modeling them

14:42.200 --> 14:43.980
on a folktale method.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.840
They seem very much like a folktale or a fairy tale to me almost.

14:48.720 --> 14:55.320
It wouldn't be surprising because I've done a great deal of work in this.

14:55.800 --> 15:06.260
I also personally tend to believe that folktales are a very, a fairly accurate form

15:06.260 --> 15:11.120
of preserving the group consciousness of the people.

15:11.120 --> 15:15.720
You know, the retellings of them through the centuries, everybody adds their own veneer,

15:15.760 --> 15:18.100
their own layer of experience so that some

15:18.100 --> 15:23.460
of our very old stories acquire more and more significances the older they get.

15:23.900 --> 15:27.180
Cinderella being a good case in point which has been changed

15:27.180 --> 15:32.140
and practically every century it's been retold to fit the current myth of.

15:34.140 --> 15:44.400
In the Paris one, I think that I was not consciously drawing on any single fairy tale

15:44.400 --> 15:52.580
that I can think of, but in the Russian one definitely, I don't know, frankly,

15:52.720 --> 15:54.540
I don't know very much about Moscow.

15:55.100 --> 16:01.260
I literally had to look up a city plan to find out what it was like.

16:01.260 --> 16:06.460
I had to look up about old Moscow and to see how far it stretched

16:06.460 --> 16:13.920
and probably what the first settlement was and where the first building stood and why

16:13.920 --> 16:16.100
and all of this sort of thing.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.480
And once I determined that, then I began thinking back

16:19.480 --> 16:22.620
on all the quintessential Russian stories that I'd ever heard,

16:22.680 --> 16:25.800
most of which seemed to involve roles in one form or another.

16:26.360 --> 16:31.760
And I thought of the character of the land and I have studied Russian.

16:32.140 --> 16:40.080
I have taken the Russian language so that I know something about the literature

16:40.080 --> 16:45.420
and I know something about the interrelations of the words, what words

16:45.420 --> 16:47.800
and what concepts are related to other words

16:47.800 --> 16:51.260
and what words are psychologically important within the language.

16:51.800 --> 16:56.660
So I just stirred all that together and came out with the Moscow story.

16:58.820 --> 17:00.860
Okay, one more observation or question on that book.

17:03.420 --> 17:07.340
You didn't have in mind any echo of the Dying Earth, did you?

17:07.380 --> 17:11.760
Were the Earths living its last days and the various cultures on it or at their end?

17:12.360 --> 17:14.660
Well, I won't say that I was unconscious of it.

17:15.220 --> 17:19.960
The Dying Earth is something I read so long ago that I think that I'm almost ready

17:19.960 --> 17:24.140
to reread it as I do things which I enjoy a great deal.

17:26.600 --> 17:31.480
Having forgotten some of the salient details of it so deeply that I think

17:31.480 --> 17:34.840
that now again I can enjoy it as I did the first time.

17:34.980 --> 17:37.460
I do recall that I liked it a great deal but I cannot

17:37.460 --> 17:43.260
for the life of me remember exactly what went on in it, which I,

17:43.580 --> 17:45.380
which is the kind of reader I am.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.940
When I really am loving a book, I begin to attempt to blur it in my mind

17:49.940 --> 17:53.580
and forget it as rapidly as possible so that I can have the pleasure

17:53.580 --> 17:56.190
of rereading it within a year or so.

17:59.340 --> 18:09.600
But I think that some of the influences on my writing in later periods than the first ones

18:09.600 --> 18:21.280
that I named have been Jack Vance and Fritz Leber and so on.

18:22.120 --> 18:26.300
And I don't think that one can remain unaffected by those ideas.

18:27.920 --> 18:33.200
They have, both of those writers have written on topics that I'm very fond of,

18:33.200 --> 18:38.200
which is the urban community and fantasy.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.840
So often, you know, fantasy pits one lone barbarian wandering off

18:42.840 --> 18:46.860
across an icy landscape coping with what comes.

18:47.860 --> 18:57.600
But the urban community in fantasy is the province of those two writers in particular

18:57.600 --> 19:01.420
that I think of at the moment and definitely they have had their influence,

19:03.100 --> 19:04.720
whether subconscious or direct.

19:04.720 --> 19:17.300
I did receive a very kind letter from Fritz Leber who was kind enough to say

19:17.300 --> 19:24.300
that he had read Sunfall and we shared some feelings for cities.

19:26.840 --> 19:34.000
Okay. One thing also that has impressed me a great deal over the work that has been out

19:34.000 --> 19:37.580
that I've read of yours is the flexibility of your style.

19:38.340 --> 19:43.680
And I wondered if you consciously work at a particular style for a particular book.

19:44.760 --> 19:45.800
Do you change it?

19:46.000 --> 19:49.620
Do you alter anything in terms of the story and the kind of book you're writing?

19:49.620 --> 19:53.880
I suppose that that has to do with being a bit of a linguist.

19:55.680 --> 20:03.760
There's also the fact that I have to break myself

20:03.760 --> 20:06.040
of writing in dactylic examiner.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.500
Old Virgil students will know what I mean.

20:10.300 --> 20:16.520
And in some books, I do allow myself to slip into a little bit more poetic style.

20:17.580 --> 20:20.920
It also seems to me that one's style should be appropriate

20:20.920 --> 20:22.980
to the story that one is telling.

20:24.120 --> 20:30.460
So that if you're telling a story about nomads whose very means of expression is going

20:30.460 --> 20:38.440
to be perhaps figurative and poetical, then you can do this sort of thing.

20:39.080 --> 20:43.820
In The Fated Sin, for instance, the styles vary radically from chapter to chapter according

20:43.820 --> 20:52.800
to whether I happen to be dealing with the nomadic culture of the Marie or whether I'm dealing

20:52.800 --> 20:56.500
with the humans who tend their narration background tends

20:56.500 --> 20:59.460
to be much more stark and efficient.

21:01.240 --> 21:07.220
I've worked in Dear Fantasy stories where I've looked at the language myself and looked back

21:07.220 --> 21:12.040
on it and thought, oh my goodness, I think I've been writing in rhythm again.

21:13.740 --> 21:20.620
A habit of which I try to cure myself because I do try to write prose.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.540
In Down Below Station, the style varies again.

21:27.660 --> 21:34.320
That is, I think, fairly bold, modern style.

21:35.080 --> 21:39.560
I guess that I just view it as a part of the composition.

21:41.820 --> 21:48.300
For instance, if I were doing a portrait as an artist of a Renaissance person,

21:48.300 --> 21:53.280
I think I would automatically tend to fall into Renaissance style in my drawing and my painting,

21:54.740 --> 21:59.700
rather than trying to be a cubist or a pointillist or whatever.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.900
It's the same way with my handling of words.

22:03.640 --> 22:11.660
If I'm talking on a subject that is itself old and my style is different and one

22:11.660 --> 22:15.300
in which I'm talking about computers, unless I'm making a point.

22:16.980 --> 22:21.240
If I were, for instance, talking about a computer as a vehicle of prophecy,

22:21.440 --> 22:25.200
I might deliberately fall back into an older mode of expression,

22:25.320 --> 22:27.340
relating it back to Delphi or something.

22:32.300 --> 22:38.000
While I find that's one of the hardest things in the world in writing sequels is

22:38.000 --> 22:40.980
because my mode of expression changes also with time.

22:42.320 --> 22:47.440
It's very, very difficult for me to go back and to recapture the language of a particular book.

22:48.380 --> 22:52.480
I have to reread it myself several times to fall back into that mode of expression.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.980
I would imagine that would be true.

22:57.540 --> 23:01.840
That sort of brings up another question I was going to ask you.

23:04.980 --> 23:10.920
When you start to write a book, do you entirely plot the thing out and have it fixed

23:10.920 --> 23:14.340
and then simply put it on paper, or do you just get in the mood

23:14.340 --> 23:16.200
and just let it come out whenever it comes?

23:17.280 --> 23:23.780
There's only one book that I've written straight through from beginning to end.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.120
Well, maybe two.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.280
I did a number of false starts.

23:29.700 --> 23:34.420
I have about 10 to 15 different beginnings for Gate of Ibril.

23:34.720 --> 23:42.760
After it gets beyond chapter five, then everything proceeds like a straight line to the end.

23:43.330 --> 23:47.660
Many of the later chapters were written first draft, which is very unusual for me.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.360
Eight drafts is not unusual in a book.

23:53.300 --> 23:56.560
The paper I generate is really phenomenal.

23:58.360 --> 24:06.280
I have filled a, I could literally fill a bushel basket with outtakes on most novels.

24:08.320 --> 24:15.900
But the one that I did write virtually from start to finish without a glitch was Wave

24:15.900 --> 24:22.160
Without a Shore, that one I just started at chapter one.

24:22.480 --> 24:22.820
Pardon me.

24:23.640 --> 24:30.500
And from chapter one to the very end, it was virtually all first draft,

24:32.360 --> 24:34.000
although I think I went through three.

24:36.140 --> 24:37.920
And that was it.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.640
Most of the others I find that I don't even start at the beginning of the book.

24:42.420 --> 24:48.160
What is now chapter eight in The Fated Sun started out as chapter one and so on.

24:48.560 --> 24:53.780
Like my literary idol, Virgil, I tend to write in both directions at once.

24:54.080 --> 24:59.840
I sort of begin at a point in action which makes sense to me, and then I discover that I have

24:59.840 --> 25:04.000
built back of that to explain how everybody got into the situation

25:04.000 --> 25:05.760
that I visualized at the beginning.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.660
Okay. I think I know the answer to this or I could suspect it, but I'm going to ask it anyhow.

25:16.020 --> 25:23.440
Your use of, when you set up an alien culture, the terms, the language that you make up for it,

25:23.440 --> 25:26.280
for instance in The Hunter of Worlds, I think you did it more extensively there

25:26.280 --> 25:27.240
than most other places.

25:28.240 --> 25:35.380
Are you using any kind of language structure or any kind of languages as a background for that?

25:35.540 --> 25:39.220
Or is it just your own knowledge of linguistics that allows you to make that up?

25:39.300 --> 25:39.540
Linguistics.

25:39.880 --> 25:44.440
I consciously, I try to make it easy on the reader.

25:45.340 --> 25:49.540
Some readers I suppose may deny this, but I truly do.

25:50.440 --> 26:01.420
I will, for instance, try to keep related words at least resembling one another closely enough

26:01.420 --> 26:08.320
that a person can figure out, well, this is something to do with say love or fight,

26:09.160 --> 26:11.560
having seen a similar configuration before.

26:11.560 --> 26:18.300
And if they miss it a little bit in terms of, say, romance versus combat or something like that,

26:18.300 --> 26:19.680
at least they're in the ballpark.

26:21.420 --> 26:28.180
I do try to be kind also in not having words which aren't related, starting with the same letter.

26:28.820 --> 26:32.940
So I do some things which are designed for kindness to the reader.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.920
Likewise, when I'm dealing with alien names, I try to avoid having two

26:38.920 --> 26:46.700
or three aliens with very similar names, which can be very, very confusing

26:46.700 --> 26:49.620
because there are many people who do not read phonetically,

26:49.720 --> 26:51.240
and this could be a problem to them.

26:51.780 --> 26:54.860
So I'll try to have them start at different points of the alphabet.

26:57.380 --> 27:03.540
Hunter of Worlds is constructed for different reasons.

27:03.660 --> 27:09.460
Usually when I use alien languages in a book, it is not for local color.

27:09.680 --> 27:12.780
It's just that when you run across anybody's civilization,

27:12.900 --> 27:16.320
which is vastly different than your own, you're going to come across three

27:16.320 --> 27:20.920
or four words which cannot be translated no matter how you would like to.

27:22.060 --> 27:27.560
It's just that not all languages have words for concepts.

27:30.060 --> 27:33.720
Well, you know, like in English, you can take several things that you can say

27:33.720 --> 27:35.840
that you can't say in French and vice versa,

27:37.820 --> 27:42.900
which is why language borrows words from other languages.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.420
When I did Hunter of Worlds, I was doing something totally different,

27:46.560 --> 27:52.680
and it is an experimental novel, and it is not a novel that I recommend to someone

27:52.680 --> 27:57.640
who is not used to science fiction or not used to language, one or the other.

27:58.780 --> 28:03.040
Basically on that one, the very premise of the book is linguistics,

28:05.180 --> 28:12.660
treating the science of linguistics as you will, as seriously as you treat physics

28:12.900 --> 28:14.500
in a science fiction novel.

28:15.980 --> 28:21.680
I deliberately set out to make a language which is not based on any earthly model.

28:22.360 --> 28:30.540
I even changed the rules of grammar to something that as far as I know is not directly based

28:30.540 --> 28:33.160
on any grammatical system on the face of the earth.

28:34.500 --> 28:39.060
The thing is explained in an appendix in the back for people

28:39.060 --> 28:41.460
who wish to do this kind of thing.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.360
And there are several ways to read the book.

28:47.520 --> 28:52.800
The recommended one is as the viewpoint character sees it.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.920
Frankly, the viewpoint character is confused to all get out most of the time.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.600
He doesn't understand.

29:00.480 --> 29:05.920
So you can equally well appreciate the book simply by realizing that from his viewpoint,

29:06.480 --> 29:10.660
a lot of these people are speaking things that he in no way comprehends.

29:11.780 --> 29:16.480
The trouble with the book is that of course at several points he's vastly mistaken

29:16.480 --> 29:18.280
about what he thinks he understands.

29:19.700 --> 29:31.060
So the book does have some pitfalls in it for somebody who is accustomed to believing everything

29:31.060 --> 29:37.600
that the hero in a novel believes must ergo be the truth because he is very,

29:37.600 --> 29:44.020
very frequently mistaken or very, very frequently picks up a concept

29:44.020 --> 29:51.540
which is not the whole concept and gradually begins to arrive at an understanding

29:51.540 --> 29:54.840
of what's going on toward the end of the book.

29:54.920 --> 30:01.220
But I must warn everyone that even at the end he is somewhat mistaken.

30:03.440 --> 30:07.100
Yeah, that book did take a little more thought I think in work than some of the others did.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.460
Let me change direction one more time.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.840
I don't know if you think about the, I'm sure you think about these things,

30:19.080 --> 30:23.980
but do you have a definition of science fiction?

30:25.560 --> 30:29.020
I think the best one that ever came up was Roger's The Last Mace definition.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.380
At least I believe it's his.

30:30.380 --> 30:32.960
I don't know from whom he may have gotten it.

30:33.580 --> 30:36.560
But it's basically that if I ever discover a definition

30:36.560 --> 30:39.560
of science fiction I shall immediately attempt to violate it.

30:41.460 --> 30:47.760
Science fiction to me is a, will always remain an experimental literature.

30:48.860 --> 30:56.320
It does not have rules except to try to adhere to science and to prove things as much as possible

30:56.320 --> 31:03.460
and to try to have your research well founded in at least the best possible understanding

31:03.460 --> 31:05.420
of what's going on that you can arrive at.

31:06.640 --> 31:13.800
To me science fiction is the same thing that the unknown writer of the Gilgamesh epic did,

31:15.700 --> 31:20.300
a voyage in search of the unknown, this sort of literature.

31:20.820 --> 31:23.560
It's the oldest kind of literature in the world.

31:25.900 --> 31:32.800
Frankly I view modern mainstream fiction as an aberration largely brought

31:32.800 --> 31:36.700
on by culture shock with the advent of the machine age.

31:38.640 --> 31:44.720
I think that it was sort of a reaction by a literary establishment

31:44.720 --> 31:50.600
that was not technologically educated and was in many instances not equipped

31:50.600 --> 31:52.720
to understand what was going on in the world.

31:54.020 --> 31:58.900
So they retreated into a rather unrealistic form of literature which totally,

31:59.520 --> 32:06.260
which really attempted to either ignore the transformation which was taking place

32:06.260 --> 32:14.800
in human society or to, or having seen it or trying to deal with it could see no answer for it.

32:15.600 --> 32:25.920
So my view of science fiction is that it is, that it is the cultural mainstream

32:25.920 --> 32:33.460
of Western literature and Eastern literature as well in many forms.

32:34.280 --> 32:41.860
And that it's no different in spirit or in type than the old epics.

32:43.020 --> 32:46.080
Epics are essentially literature of migration

32:47.660 --> 32:51.440
and mankind is presently contemplating a rather large one.

32:54.160 --> 32:58.480
Could you tell me what you think draws people to science fiction, why it's so popular?

32:59.400 --> 33:06.060
I think the same thing that has always drawn people to all of the aforementioned.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.840
It's curiosity.

33:09.460 --> 33:14.180
It's a wish to be in touch with one's environment, one's real environment.

33:17.040 --> 33:24.560
There are so many people who go through their daily lives concerned only with what happens

33:24.560 --> 33:27.030
in the office and what happens around them.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.940
And it's sort of like being locked in one cell.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.820
You never see beyond that.

33:36.200 --> 33:43.620
Nature and the universe have so much more to it than what you perceive

33:43.620 --> 33:48.340
if you limit your vision to your immediate time and your immediate place

33:48.340 --> 33:50.080
and your immediate circumstance.

33:54.800 --> 33:59.360
There's a certain nobility in ordinary daily affairs.

34:00.060 --> 34:02.140
I do not deny that.

34:02.560 --> 34:06.420
But I think that the real understanding of what actually goes

34:06.420 --> 34:11.200
on in those ordinary daily affairs only comes

34:11.200 --> 34:13.880
through a wider understanding of the universe as a whole.

34:14.680 --> 34:18.360
And this is what I think draws people to science fiction, to fantasy,

34:19.100 --> 34:29.400
to this whole vast realm of a romantical or positive way of looking at the universe,

34:29.400 --> 34:35.060
which has been in the mainstream of thought since literature began.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.780
Okay. Maybe you've answered this already.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.560
Maybe I'm just restating the question, but let me ask it anyhow.

34:44.520 --> 34:49.120
Do you think science fiction has a particular value for its readers?

34:50.320 --> 34:52.340
I could not hear the last part of that question.

34:53.180 --> 34:55.940
Would you say that science fiction had a particular value,

34:56.240 --> 34:58.800
or is it a valuable thing for its readers?

34:59.700 --> 35:07.460
Yes, I would say that the value of science fiction is essentially the broadening of vision,

35:09.240 --> 35:12.140
the broadening of vision in time,

35:12.200 --> 35:16.160
because we do not really concern ourselves only with the future.

35:17.400 --> 35:26.640
This is why fantasy, which deals with past ages, has been quite as comfortable

35:26.640 --> 35:29.980
in associating science fiction as it has.

35:30.900 --> 35:34.860
On the one hand, it should seem very strange to find fantasy readers

35:34.860 --> 35:37.240
and science fiction readers trading books.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.220
We'd think that we had nothing to say to each other.

35:41.460 --> 35:45.840
But in point of fact, we have all the world to say to each other.

35:46.260 --> 35:48.860
We have all of human experience to say to each other.

35:49.440 --> 35:54.680
We have the long view, one sort of being the memory of mankind,

35:54.680 --> 35:59.880
and the other being the hope and the aspirations of where we will go and what we will do.

36:01.140 --> 36:06.740
Two sides of the same coin, or as Degri would put it, part of the great now.

36:09.920 --> 36:16.480
It's a kind of literature that widens the experience beyond one's daily life.

36:17.940 --> 36:22.960
It shows us the true size of the earth, the true size of the universe.

36:24.360 --> 36:31.180
The true importance of our troubles, both the size and complexity of them

36:31.180 --> 36:33.720
and sometimes the extreme simplicity of them.

36:34.680 --> 36:40.280
It gives us perspective in dealing with the world around us and with each other.

36:41.880 --> 36:47.100
And shows us that we have, in many instances,

36:47.920 --> 36:50.480
a good deal more in common than we do in difference.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.200
Okay, that's excellent.

36:54.240 --> 36:54.960
Thank you very much.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.100
I don't have very much more to ask you.

36:58.220 --> 36:58.880
Just a couple more.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.080
Yeah, David?

37:02.140 --> 37:03.620
Are you drying out on us?

37:03.640 --> 37:04.720
Are you okay on that end?

37:05.400 --> 37:06.740
Yeah. Okay.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.300
I guess really sort of, well, okay.

37:12.620 --> 37:14.460
It's sort of a two-prong question maybe.

37:14.520 --> 37:20.060
I wondered which of your books are the most popular in terms of sales, you know,

37:20.060 --> 37:23.040
your best sellers and also maybe in terms of fan response.

37:24.940 --> 37:32.960
It's very difficult to judge this because I'm fairly young as a writer goes.

37:34.060 --> 37:40.620
My works have only been out now for what, six years, something like that.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.080
And sales figures are still coming in.

37:45.160 --> 37:48.560
So the only thing I can tell you is that the oldest books have sold the most.

37:49.680 --> 37:56.920
And there does seem, if you compared sales figures to be some acceleration in it.

37:57.380 --> 38:03.140
Also, there must be a remarkable number of people that having read one are going

38:03.140 --> 38:07.720
for the others, I hope that this is the case because the sales figures seem

38:07.720 --> 38:17.760
to be remarkably similar in terms of, well,

38:17.760 --> 38:20.320
there's been some books that I've noticed that have caught

38:20.320 --> 38:22.780
on a little more slowly, like Hunter.

38:23.520 --> 38:27.960
I think that perhaps it took a little bit of readers getting used to me before they,

38:29.200 --> 38:32.240
before they were ready to deal with Hunter of Worlds.

38:34.420 --> 38:39.900
But in general, I would say that the sales have been fairly well, fairly well even.

38:40.540 --> 38:48.880
Or if they were not even, they tend to become more and more even.

38:52.240 --> 38:56.020
Which I think has also helped with the fact that all my books are in current issue.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.840
And if one likes one, one can find the others.

39:03.860 --> 39:08.480
So about the other, it's kind of curious.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.640
But again, time plays a part in that.

39:13.040 --> 39:20.540
The Morgane books, the Gate trilogy does attract a great deal of male response in AIL.

39:22.360 --> 39:28.300
In the sense that possibly because it is a Finnish story and there was a great deal of it

39:28.300 --> 39:31.400
and possibly people spent a great deal of time with it.

39:32.160 --> 39:36.780
Also the fact that I think fantasy people are great letter writers.

39:38.740 --> 39:45.880
I do get quite a lot of male on that.

39:46.260 --> 39:49.340
It also seems to provoke Spanish art.

39:50.540 --> 39:56.240
I've seen a great number of very beautiful renditions of the characters from that book,

39:56.240 --> 40:01.420
which again may say something about the, you know, what people's favorite may be.

40:03.640 --> 40:09.520
But then it's got a lot of things that are really, really nice to draw, like horses

40:09.520 --> 40:11.700
and medieval armor and this sort of thing.

40:14.660 --> 40:17.980
I also get a great deal of male about the Fated Sun trilogy.

40:19.340 --> 40:24.420
And a great deal of interest in that one.

40:25.940 --> 40:28.640
So the two longer ones.
