00:11.720 --> 00:20.460
The Science Fiction Radio Show A commentary on science fiction today Presented
by the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.540 --> 00:26.960
This is David Crews, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.860 --> 00:40.400
The subject of this show is science fiction music, including that of science
fiction motion pictures and other sources. The importance of music to movies, I

00:40.400 --> 00:50.020
think, is an obvious thing. A good musical score can do a number of things for a
movie. It can create a mood for the entire picture. It can dramatize the actions

00:50.020 --> 00:58.900
of a particular scene. It can also rouse the emotions of the audience. With
science fiction movies, I think this is true also, but with another dimension to

00:58.900 --> 01:08.880
it. The situations and moods of a science fiction movie might be of a very
different nature. You might have, for instance, a meeting with a race of aliens.

01:11.440 --> 01:20.320
The awesomeness of a space battle. The discovery of a new planet. Situations or
moods that might take something a little different, a little special. And I

01:20.320 --> 01:29.020
think it requires a special breed of composer to accomplish this. But the best
science fiction music, I think, can evoke what good science fiction itself

01:29.020 --> 01:32.960
evokes, a sense of wonder and excitement.

02:58.100 --> 03:09.580
That was the main theme from Star Wars. Much of the music used in science
fiction movies has its roots in classical music. One of the more popular and

03:09.580 --> 03:22.940
well-known works of this type is the suite for large orchestra by Gustav Holst
called The Planets. It was written between 1914 and 1918. And it contains a

03:22.940 --> 03:32.840
series of pieces on each planet that was known at that time, Mars through
Neptune, and gives a musical impression of each one. During the filming of Star

03:32.840 --> 03:40.980
Wars, they used the music from Holst's The Planets to use as background music
behind the scenes while they were being roughly edited together. They used this

03:40.980 --> 03:47.800
music in order to give the director and crew a sense of what the music was going
to be like when the picture was completed. They liked the music so much that

03:47.800 --> 03:57.440
when they had the original score written, they had it written with the same type
of orchestration and theme that was in The Planets. As an example now of what

03:57.440 --> 04:06.860
this is like, and maybe you could compare it to what the Star Wars theme was
like, let's listen to Mars, The Bringer of War, from Gustav Holst's The Planets.

04:06.980 --> 04:39.960
This is Bernard Herrmann conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra.

06:20.320 --> 06:27.020
Holst treated The Planets not in their astronomical aspect so much as in their astrological. Now

06:27.020 --> 06:32.980
the astrology isn't to be taken seriously. The titles would only indicate moods.

06:32.060 --> 06:42.720
They're more like tone poems that evoke particular moods. For instance,
Mars, the Bringer of War, evokes the mechanized horrors of modern warfare, since

06:42.720 --> 06:55.960
in his astrological aspect, Mars, is the god of war. Indeed, as Harry Halbrack
said, the planets belongs to our time as genuine space music. And of course, who

06:55.960 --> 07:03.620
can forget the unique blend of classical music with science fiction and probably
one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, 2001.

08:46.200 --> 08:54.680
Just as in Star Wars, the people producing 2001 used classical music behind
their movie as they were editing it together. The difference here is being that

08:54.680 --> 09:03.700
they liked the music so much that they used it in the movie. And what they had
to do was to, to junk an entire score that had been composed by Alex North. And

09:03.700 --> 09:12.240
it was not used in the movie because this, this classical background was so
successful. The piece you just heard, which is probably the most famous theme

09:12.240 --> 09:24.340
from the movie 2001, is in actuality a piece from a classical composition called
Also sprach Zarathustra, written by Richard Strauss in 1896. It's from a long tone

09:24.340 --> 09:32.520
poem. This is just the fanfare from that piece. Another piece used in the film
was written by Richard's father, Johan, and it is one of the most famous of the

09:32.520 --> 09:40.440
Viennese waltzes, The Blue Danube, used in the incredible, the and unforgettable
scene of the rocket ship approaching the space station in Earth orbit.

10:15.060 --> 10:24.160
As the 1950s began, we were treated to a number of low budget science fiction
films. One of them in particular, Rocket Ship XM, had music by a rather well

10:24.160 --> 10:35.960
known classical composer, Ferde Grofe, the composer of the Grand Canyon Suite.
Grofe was noted for his suites. He wrote many of them. His musical method was

10:35.960 --> 10:44.480
very simple. If you want to evoke the sound of a gun, you would fire a gun,
which he did in his, one of his compositions. If you wanted the sound of a fire

10:44.480 --> 10:54.340
engine, you would record a fire engine. So his music is full of old typewriters
clacking, earthquakes going off, fog horns bellowing, cable car bells ringing.

10:54.680 --> 11:02.100
And that kind of simple basic method, I think, is appropriate, particularly
appropriate for the, for a dramatic science fiction movie, which Rocket Ship XM

11:02.100 --> 11:13.060
was. In 1950, producer Robert Lippert decided to approach Grofe and try to get
him to compose the music for the film. Grofe did not particularly want to be

11:13.060 --> 11:21.540
involved with low budget science fiction films, which were not exactly
considered the best by critics at that time. And he agreed only to write the

11:21.540 --> 11:30.600
basic themes for the music. The actual composition of the orchestration was done
by Albert Glasser. The following is a sampling of some of the pieces from Rocket

11:30.600 --> 11:34.540
Ship XM, including a solo by a unique instrument, the theremin.

14:20.940 --> 14:24.220
Rocket Ship XM is available on Starlog Records from Starlog Magazine.

14:25.520 --> 14:31.380
One of the most famous of the early Hollywood film composers is Bernard Herrmann. Herrmann is

14:31.380 --> 14:37.720
richly versed in classical music and his themes reflect that. He's mostly noted for his scores

14:37.720 --> 14:43.540
to Hitchcock movies such as North by Northwest and Psycho. We're going to play two selections written

14:43.540 --> 14:47.520
and conducted by Herrmann, Journey to the Center of the Earth and The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.

19:03.180 --> 19:08.300
One of the most noteworthy movies from the 50s was Forbidden Planet by Metro Goldenmayer.

19:09.440 --> 19:15.720
The music for that was extremely original. It was Electronic Tonalities composed by Louis and

19:15.720 --> 19:21.380
Bebe Barron. Electronic music was in its infancy and synthesizers had not even been invented.

19:21.980 --> 19:24.060
This is a brief excerpt from part of the soundtrack.

20:49.440 --> 20:55.420
Any contemporary moviegoer and anyone who has ears to hear is familiar with the work of John Williams.

20:56.400 --> 21:02.560
The composer's competence is attested to by the fact that he was recently made the conductor of

21:02.560 --> 21:10.340
the Boston Pops Orchestra, replacing Arthur Fiedler. He's done movies such as Jaws, Star Wars,

21:11.190 --> 21:17.100
Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman, The Empire Strikes Back.

21:18.060 --> 21:22.740
We'll start with the with the haunting Princess Leia's theme from Star Wars.

22:33.860 --> 22:34.380
The

22:34.380 --> 22:39.140
same year that Star Wars was completed, John Williams was also working on another movie.

22:39.140 --> 22:45.140
It was Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Actually, John wrote the music before the

22:45.140 --> 22:49.520
movie was completed and some of the scenes in the movie were matched to the music, which is usually

22:49.520 --> 22:54.780
the other way around. This is some of the most incredible music that John Williams has written.

22:55.340 --> 22:59.120
I don't think anything evokes the sense of wonder quite as much as when the

22:59.120 --> 23:02.200
first visitors appear to the earth people.

24:12.820 --> 24:19.500
Williams next did the music for the movie Superman. It was interesting in that movie he had the

24:19.500 --> 24:25.940
characters were identified by a particular mood, a particular kind of musical composition which

24:25.940 --> 24:31.680
identified their character. Lois Lane, for instance, was identified with a romantic ballad.

24:32.520 --> 24:38.480
Otis, the bumbling helper, had a comic flatulent march theme for a bassoon.

24:39.780 --> 24:45.380
Jor-El on the planet Krypton had a music which evoked a sense of mystic benevolence.

24:46.360 --> 24:51.960
But probably the best known compositions from the movie was the Fanfare, one of the

24:51.960 --> 24:54.140
heroic themes identified with Superman.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.060
We'll also play a short excerpt from the famous flying scene.

26:58.480 --> 27:03.400
John Williams, of course, also composed the score for the sequel to Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back.

27:04.500 --> 27:09.200
Another recent science fiction motion picture released in 1979 was Star Trek,

27:09.300 --> 27:14.300
the motion picture with music by Jerry Goldsmith. The film score was nominated for Academy Award

27:14.300 --> 27:18.700
and was well deserving of that and here is a selection from it called The Klingon Battle.

28:53.480 --> 28:58.060
Many of the most noted soundtracks released lately have been from science fiction movies and I believe

28:58.060 --> 29:01.200
that we can look forward to seeing much the same in the future.

29:08.920 --> 29:12.080
This is David Crews, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

29:13.360 --> 29:18.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

29:18.740 --> 29:24.580
