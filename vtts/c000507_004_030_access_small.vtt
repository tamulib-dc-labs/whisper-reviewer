WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:02.780
Get here than we thought we would.

00:03.240 --> 00:05.680
Not there in the Siberian wastelands of West Texas.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.120
Yes, believe it or not.

00:09.240 --> 00:14.560
I have a friend that lives in Newcastle, Virginia, and apparently you've been pretty bad.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.100
It's been raining for two days now, so I'll clear it up.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.180
At least raining is not snowing, huh?

00:22.460 --> 00:22.720
Yeah.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.380
David, do you have a level?

00:24.880 --> 00:25.740
Yeah, pretty good.

00:26.160 --> 00:26.860
Looking good?

00:27.320 --> 00:27.560
Yeah.

00:28.620 --> 00:31.940
Okay, well let's get the road on the show then.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.680
The tape is running now, so whatever you say can be held against you now.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.620
Okay, I want to start out with a statement.

00:42.180 --> 00:48.060
Your science fiction certainly has a novel approach, and on the back of space-time donuts,

00:48.320 --> 00:54.200
it says that the Panchen say that Rucker has busted free of all the linearities and restrictions of modern science fiction.

00:54.200 --> 00:59.440
So what I want to do first of all is explore your science fiction roots a bit.

01:00.200 --> 01:06.180
When did you get interested in science fiction, that sort of thing, and did you write how did it appear?

01:06.800 --> 01:10.220
Well, when I was growing up I read quite a bit of science fiction.

01:11.400 --> 01:21.200
I lived in Louisville, I grew up in Louisville, and my mother used to get me high-end lines, juvenile novels, revolved in 2100s,

01:21.200 --> 01:25.880
or Rolling Stones, The Puppet Masters.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.000
Those books, and I really enjoyed those books.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.900
And then I used to go to the library, they didn't have a great deal of science fiction,

01:33.080 --> 01:38.420
but they had, you know, like, best stories of 1942 or something.

01:39.580 --> 01:45.780
And read that stuff, and then when I got out of high school I started reading it less.

01:46.840 --> 01:52.320
It seemed like, well, I liked Sheckley a lot too, because I was really, really loved Sheckley.

01:52.700 --> 01:53.280
Robert Sheckley.

01:54.220 --> 01:58.440
And then in high school I was, I still read that.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.840
In college I didn't read it so much.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.860
I read some Bonnegut, I always thought,

02:02.900 --> 02:05.300
Science of Titan was a really good science fiction book.

02:06.780 --> 02:11.680
And then I really went away from it for a number of years, because I was more interested in being a beatnik.

02:13.240 --> 02:18.520
You know, like Jack Carrell, William Burroughs, all that kind of stuff.

02:21.240 --> 02:26.380
And then at some point I wanted to start writing Science Fiction again.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.180
I wanted to start writing anything.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.660
And, well, why don't you ask me a question?

02:33.080 --> 02:34.340
How do I go on with the song?

02:36.020 --> 02:43.060
When you did decide to write Science Fiction, and the end result was our first exposure to your white light,

02:44.380 --> 02:48.000
and it did bust free quote unquote of the Science Fiction restrictions,

02:48.580 --> 02:56.500
did you write to bust free of restrictions, or did you just write what came and it just happened to bust free of restrictions?

02:56.500 --> 02:59.740
Well, I always wanted to be an avant-garde writer.

03:02.160 --> 03:06.960
And like Science Fiction is a place where it's easy to write whatever you want to.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.440
Actually the first book I wrote was Spacetime Donuts.

03:11.780 --> 03:18.700
And that I wrote, I think it was in 70, I think it's 77, when I wrote it.

03:19.140 --> 03:21.720
Or perhaps 76, it's under that.

03:24.460 --> 03:28.340
And that I wrote right after seeing the Rolling Stones play live, Buffalo.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.400
I just like really wanted to do something.

03:33.760 --> 03:37.820
I wrote this, I wrote it during the summer, and I was teaching it that time.

03:38.080 --> 03:38.980
It upstate New York.

03:40.600 --> 03:48.580
And there what I wanted to do with that book was make a strong anarchist statement about the way I saw it in that society.

03:48.580 --> 03:57.840
And it was basically sort of late 60s, really, book, even though it was really in mid 70s.

03:57.840 --> 04:04.040
And then with white light, the way I came to write white light was kind of weird.

04:05.980 --> 04:09.120
I wrote Spacetime Donuts and I couldn't sell that anywhere.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.320
And finally On Earth Magazine agreed to serialize it.

04:14.100 --> 04:19.460
And they serialized the first two parts of it and they went out of business.

04:20.900 --> 04:22.600
And at that point I lost my job.

04:23.140 --> 04:28.140
And where I was teaching it upstate New York, they wouldn't give me ten years of business on this.

04:28.900 --> 04:29.640
It was different.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.380
But then I got a grant to go to do mathematics in Germany.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.560
Got a grant from the German government.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.120
Went to Ladoberg, went there for two year, well two year grants there.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.700
And it's from the Fund Homebolls Foundation.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.780
That's why some of my books are dedicated to Fund Homebolls.

04:51.140 --> 04:58.940
And I got over there and to my delight I discovered that the person in charge of my research really didn't care about mathematics either.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.420
And so I just started writing science fiction.

05:03.200 --> 05:07.680
And I spent about three months trying to solve this problem, continuum problem.

05:08.660 --> 05:11.600
I knew a lot about it. It's a very difficult problem.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.060
And then I said, well I'm just going to write a novel about it.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.440
And that's why I came to write White Light that way.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.560
Which it's about different levels of affinity.

05:23.820 --> 05:28.240
And I've always seen, you know, like I want to do one of the busker linearities.

05:28.420 --> 05:31.320
Because I like Patty Smith, you know, I like the wrong stuff.

05:31.940 --> 05:35.880
And I just like to kind of tear down the wall.

05:36.860 --> 05:38.980
And break through to something that's truer.

05:41.320 --> 05:49.360
While we have you in Germany, did the experiences there, or some of the experiences, were those written into your stories, ratings, your cat?

05:49.860 --> 05:53.140
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that's just about what it was like in Heidelberg.

05:54.340 --> 05:57.560
And since then I've written a novel called The Sex Sphere.

05:58.260 --> 06:01.000
And that's based totally on my experiences in Europe.

06:01.940 --> 06:04.740
At this point I'm still looking for a publisher for that.

06:07.760 --> 06:13.120
But I like to use, generally whatever settings I use it's almost like someplace I've been.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.020
The answer wrote software when I was in Germany.

06:18.740 --> 06:21.320
The first years there I wrote White Light, the second year I wrote software.

06:22.820 --> 06:25.400
And the software I was trying to think different.

06:25.400 --> 06:30.540
Because in a way both Space Time Donuts and White Light are autobiographical.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.300
They're both essentially the main, the hero that's main.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.340
And then I wanted to see if I could do a book where I wasn't in it.

06:38.940 --> 06:46.320
And so software, there's like a young guy who's sort of, you know, based on a guy that I used to hang around with.

06:47.060 --> 06:47.940
A guy younger than me.

06:48.500 --> 06:52.920
And the old guy in there is, can extend based on the form of it.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.180
So I did that.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.220
And then The Sex Sphere, that's back to basically being about me.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.440
My main overall plan is over my life.

07:04.800 --> 07:09.300
I'll do like Jack Kerouac, a whole lot of novels that are basically my life story.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.600
So it transcended autobiography.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.840
Okay, the protagonist in White Light, Felix Raymond.

07:18.840 --> 07:25.840
It struck me that he was basically happiest when he was teaching one of his advanced courses.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.000
And when he was playing with his little girl.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.480
Otherwise he didn't seem all that happy.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.780
Is that, I know that I read that you have three children.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.020
Is that autobiographical?

07:38.560 --> 07:39.600
I do have the three children.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.860
I am happy when I'm playing with them.

07:42.720 --> 07:47.300
I communicate, you know, better, perhaps, with children than with grown-ups.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.280
You know with children you can just, you know, wrap on and do anything.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.860
And they're not going to see why.

07:56.960 --> 08:05.020
One thing that I noticed that in common between the protagonist in White Light and the hero in Shradinger's Cat.

08:05.540 --> 08:11.740
They both, at one time or another, were stuck at, oh shall we say, out of the way colleges.

08:12.220 --> 08:17.540
Oh yeah, that was definitely my experience when I was, this place in upstate New York.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.740
The town called Genesee is near Rochester.

08:23.320 --> 08:27.040
And it was, it was really, you know, like, it was nowhere.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.940
And again I'm stuck in nowhere too.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.260
It's like my fate, you know.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.160
It's like if you can't deal with something it just keeps coming back with you.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.400
Because I could even, if you can't deal with it.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.960
Now I'm here in Lynchburg.

08:42.100 --> 08:45.520
I guess I'll probably try to get a book about Lynchburg too at this point.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.840
Yeah, I have some questions on that at the end.

08:50.620 --> 08:57.780
The thing about, another thing about White Light that struck me, I, I saw it when it came out and I purposely did not buy it

08:57.780 --> 09:02.240
because the packaging led me to believe that it wasn't something I would be interested in.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.400
Then I read a review.

09:03.980 --> 09:05.340
Well yeah, it's very thought-ary packaging.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.520
I was going to ask you what you thought of it.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.300
Well, when I saw it I was surprised.

09:10.580 --> 09:11.980
It just, it amused me.

09:12.140 --> 09:12.880
I thought it was funny.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.780
And well the one thing I got them to put on the cover was, do you want to see God?

09:17.820 --> 09:19.600
I got them to put that on the back.

09:20.740 --> 09:26.160
And I've met people since then that are really into like dream stuff and astral travel.

09:26.640 --> 09:34.960
Like they've read it and very seriously and they're just like, don't understand why the book is sort of not so serious as it should be.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.100
And when I was Jim Bain, he was the editor of the Ace at that time.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.740
And he bought it. I was happy that he bought it.

09:43.820 --> 09:44.840
You know, he gave me good money.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.920
And it was his marketing decision.

09:48.180 --> 09:57.160
He probably thought, well we can sell him more copies if we package it as, you know, something for sort of superstitious foolish people

09:57.160 --> 10:00.320
instead of packaging it as avant-garde literature.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.260
I imagine he's probably right.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.480
This, I mean I take a long view.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.720
I mean these books are going to be out there and soon later they'll find their audience.

10:14.020 --> 10:19.880
This book had more higher mathematics in it than any science fiction book I've ever read.

10:20.960 --> 10:25.600
When I think about it, I don't recall that many science fiction stories that are based on math.

10:25.700 --> 10:29.940
Most of them are Mobius strips or some take off on that.

10:29.940 --> 10:33.660
I did have a lot of math. I wanted them to mention that on the cover, you know.

10:34.120 --> 10:39.720
I said to Bain, I said, well why don't we say this is, it's like, you know, the flat land.

10:40.020 --> 10:43.060
You know that book about the fourth dimension? The Edwin Abbott's flat land.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.620
It was written like in the 1800s.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.820
So I wanted him to say, well you know, this is, it's interesting about mathematics, it's flat land.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.560
This is Rudy, we do that and the book is going straight down the toilet.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.380
Oh, I don't know.

10:57.880 --> 11:03.860
The last two books, Ace, has tried to do a more, somewhat more high tone presentation.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.420
I like that though, that I mean to have your books presented in this low-brow way,

11:11.700 --> 11:13.440
then you can like reach the masses.

11:14.780 --> 11:18.280
Which is really, I mean, like a lot of people read science fiction,

11:18.280 --> 11:23.260
it doesn't have to be presented as like, you know, a New Yorker story.

11:24.940 --> 11:27.980
Although really, you know, I'm trying to get to the same deep.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.920
Do you plan to concentrate on the mathematics as much in subsequent works?

11:35.960 --> 11:37.000
Oh, not necessarily.

11:38.540 --> 11:43.640
Well, for a book I need, I need an idea, you know, an interesting idea.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.780
Something that interest me to explore.

11:47.300 --> 11:50.740
And Infinity was what I was interested in exploring in white light.

11:51.380 --> 11:56.680
And based on donuts, I was interested in a certain idea about the structure of space that I had.

11:58.660 --> 12:02.980
And in software, I was interested in something to do with girdled,

12:03.020 --> 12:04.840
and artificial intelligence.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.040
In the sax sphere, I was interested in something called Hilbert space.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.060
That's an infinite dimensional space.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.680
And I don't know, right now I'm just going to write a book that's pretty,

12:20.300 --> 12:23.640
it's about inertia, I mean it's about a physics idea.

12:24.860 --> 12:28.140
I wouldn't want to like be categorized as somebody who writes about math,

12:28.600 --> 12:30.820
because I'm also interested in physics and philosophy.

12:33.340 --> 12:37.440
But I mean, definitely, I do have like a lot of training, a lot of interest in science.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.580
The first book I published was actually a mathematics book.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.880
It was called Geometry Relativity, the Fourth Dimension.

12:45.820 --> 12:49.040
And that came out in 1977, from Dover.

12:50.300 --> 12:54.120
And that was basically a popular presentation of things in the Fourth Dimension.

12:55.340 --> 12:59.620
And I also have another mathematics book coming out this spring in April.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.960
It's called The Trinity in the Mind.

13:03.100 --> 13:08.260
And that basically, that's going to give you most of the theory that lies behind white money.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.880
And these books don't count on tenure, on your publishing record, huh?

13:15.380 --> 13:19.260
Well, everywhere, I mean I just got fired here as well.

13:19.700 --> 13:26.120
Every place I get a job, they throw me out, because they see me as a dangerous person, a dangerous idea.

13:29.840 --> 13:37.560
And it's annoying, but then I think, well, how cool could I be if these stupid straight-blind people would keep me on?

13:40.080 --> 13:45.320
So after this summer, I'm going to be, I have a teaching job now, here in Lynchburg, I'm going to leave it.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.920
And after this summer, I'll be just writing.

13:48.660 --> 13:52.020
I think I'm going to have enough books coming out so I can live off the writing.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.340
Why do you think you're perceived as dangerous?

13:56.700 --> 14:03.860
Well, because, well, I take important things seriously, and I don't take unimportant things seriously.

14:04.540 --> 14:11.020
You know, I'm interested in the absolute, and I like to freak people out, I guess.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.320
I mean, I don't go out of my way to do it.

14:13.420 --> 14:17.380
I just, I'm just, you know, like the world's worst politician.

14:19.840 --> 14:26.500
Do you think you'd have less trouble, let's say, if you were in a big league school, a faculty on a big league school,

14:27.680 --> 14:34.040
Berkeley, or say, one of the big ten schools, Ivy League, where maybe they're a little more tolerant?

14:34.600 --> 14:37.440
It's possible, but the thing is I can't get in the door there.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.300
Are you interested in math enough?

14:40.340 --> 14:41.740
That's a poor way to put it, okay.

14:42.360 --> 14:46.440
I think we go to math conferences and it just spores, it's very boring to listen to.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.560
I mean, I'm interested in, but only in my own terms.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.520
That's, that's living my whole life in my own terms.

14:53.500 --> 14:58.580
At this point, I'm going to be able to quit and just write, and I don't think I would want to go back.

14:59.460 --> 15:00.860
Are you going to Stan Lynchburg?

15:01.780 --> 15:07.140
At present, we, you know, we've made some friends here, and we've got nice house.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.980
You know, it's not the ideal place. I'd rather be a little bit closer to a big city.

15:14.640 --> 15:21.020
You know, like, but right now, it's, you know, with the three kids and all, I can't go losing in the two years.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.460
So I'm going to be here another year.

15:27.440 --> 15:34.220
It did strike me as ironic when I read that you lived in Lynchburg because that's, I believe the headquarters of CBN,

15:35.120 --> 15:39.560
the Christian Broadcasting Network, with all their worldwide facilities and all.

15:39.580 --> 15:44.200
Well, Jerry Farrow and the moral majority. CBN, actually their headquarters is at Virginia Beach.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.100
But Jerry's here, and so is the moral majority.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.280
Does that actually have quite an influence in the town itself?

15:50.800 --> 15:53.140
Well, when I was going to move here, I was real freaked out about it.

15:53.260 --> 15:55.180
You know, I thought like everybody here is going to be a zombie.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.040
But actually Lynchburg, it's a fairly large community.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.380
I mean, it's, I don't know the exact figure, but it's a pretty big town.

16:06.060 --> 16:10.240
And generally speaking, the people that are supporters of Jerry,

16:10.660 --> 16:14.040
all will live on the other side of town from where I live.

16:14.760 --> 16:23.500
I can't say that I've met, I've lived here two years and I haven't met a single person who doesn't think that he's, you know, I mean,

16:24.740 --> 16:27.540
I haven't met a single person who's a follower of his.

16:27.540 --> 16:32.880
I did go to the church once to check it out. I mean, as a science fiction writer, I definitely used to go check it out.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.800
And it was just like, you know, it's like a TV studio.

16:39.220 --> 16:41.940
I mean, it's just, they all said one prayer, the whole service.

16:42.340 --> 16:45.380
You know what they prayed for? They prayed for five million dollars.

16:49.140 --> 16:52.440
But it really, they haven't bothered me, they haven't affected me.

16:52.440 --> 16:58.960
I mean, there's a lot of people here just, you know, in a sense, he does not anywhere.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.080
He's on the airways. He's not really anywhere.

17:06.660 --> 17:10.800
Okay, back to space time donuts. That was interesting, by the way.

17:12.260 --> 17:17.740
You have a lot of, you have a zippy vocabulary and I think that really adds a lot to your characters.

17:17.740 --> 17:24.560
There's a couple of words I have to know the etymology of and that was the loaches and ZZ74.

17:24.940 --> 17:27.640
I can't help but think there's something hidden behind those.

17:28.180 --> 17:32.280
Okay, well, I'll tell you what a loach is. It's actually, we still have a fish tank.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.480
There's a kind of fish you can get called a loach.

17:36.040 --> 17:40.800
It's a real weird fish because it doesn't have any fins. It's long and just wriggles.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.060
And it's like really sick.

17:42.860 --> 17:48.500
And then also there's the factor that in high school, my wife, she grew up in D.C.

17:48.700 --> 17:53.100
and used to call the police the Roach, like a cop car was the Roach Coach.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.980
So then I thought loach, you know, so that was the loach.

17:57.740 --> 18:00.320
I didn't know I'd just say the pig, you know, so I said the loach.

18:01.480 --> 18:08.260
And ZZ74, this was, Mastiki and Janice, there's a kid I used to, he's a student,

18:08.260 --> 18:11.800
but I used to hang around with one, Diamond Joe.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.900
And he was telling me once with this drug.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.460
I could never really tell if he was putting me on or not.

18:19.540 --> 18:23.180
But it was a drug called ZZ74 that you would take.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.500
And it was just like being dead.

18:26.860 --> 18:30.120
And so, I don't know, just the name of the drug, it seemed so neat.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.980
When he told me this, it was 1974.

18:32.960 --> 18:36.000
And so I kind of just hung on to that name.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I don't know if there really was such a drug.

18:39.860 --> 18:43.400
Of course in the book there isn't because it's like this.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.160
I don't like it.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.640
Okay, as you remarked, this book is very 60-ish.

18:51.640 --> 18:55.660
And the adjective that came to my mind when I read it was Phil Dickie,

18:56.240 --> 18:58.340
as though Philip K. Dick wrote it.

18:58.860 --> 19:03.060
So I have to ask that he have any influence on you, have you read his works?

19:03.060 --> 19:05.520
Well, yeah, I mean, I like Philip Dick a lot.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.160
You know, I generally forget all the famous books I read.

19:12.040 --> 19:16.780
And so, I don't know, there's some things about him that,

19:18.100 --> 19:20.620
like his plots don't usually wrap up too well.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.420
Like, I'm like a good, tight plot.

19:23.860 --> 19:27.220
I mean, he always starts shifting the reality so much.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.520
And it becomes, it's only locally interesting.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.900
There's not enough global structure to me in his books.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.520
No, I mean, he's definitely one of my favorite writers.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.520
I think I try to get a local structure kind of like Dick,

19:45.700 --> 19:49.900
but what I think I can do that he's not always pulling off

19:49.900 --> 19:52.220
is to have more of a global plot.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.480
It puts up a book, you know, makes a package of it, keeps you reading.

19:58.340 --> 20:01.200
My favorite book of his is Scanner Darkly.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.240
Scanner Darkly.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.900
I was reading that in England.

20:06.860 --> 20:09.700
In Germany, I went over to the Seacont.

20:09.960 --> 20:10.140
Right?

20:12.060 --> 20:15.100
And I got hold of it, I was reading it.

20:15.520 --> 20:19.240
It just really was one of the happiest days of my life.

20:19.400 --> 20:23.680
I woke up and it got high with all these English science fiction people.

20:24.580 --> 20:28.880
I had placed white lines with publishers in Virgin here.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.800
It's got Maxim Jakubowski.

20:31.700 --> 20:35.240
He was a record company in England, Virgin Records.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.720
And they were going to start publishing science fiction.

20:39.660 --> 20:43.920
And so I met the guy, Maxim Jakubowski, and he got him to take white lines.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.360
So they published it actually in England before they published it in the U.S.

20:49.240 --> 20:55.720
And just like lying around in this cheap room in a rooming house and reading Scanner Darkly

20:55.720 --> 20:58.120
was really one of the best times I've had.

21:01.980 --> 21:05.740
I would think your books would go over well in England.

21:06.360 --> 21:11.160
They seemed to be a little more receptive to the avant-garde type plots and so forth.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.580
Well, you know, really the sales has been better in the U.S.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.680
Well, Virgin, they made a mistake.

21:20.820 --> 21:23.500
They went to the other extreme from Ace in the way they packaged it.

21:24.100 --> 21:29.680
They put it in a real small type and said it was the cult novel of the 80s, stuff like that.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.420
And they didn't really show as many as they did.

21:37.260 --> 21:42.340
Software seems to me to be the most linear quote-unquote of your three science fiction novels.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.180
And you were exploring robot sentience.

21:45.180 --> 21:50.420
I've never seen robot sentience explored before.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.500
It's generally robot civil rights, something like that.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.340
But again, this was the first.

21:56.220 --> 21:57.780
Or just what it would be like to be a robot?

21:58.440 --> 22:00.580
Yeah, do they have souls, that sort of thing.

22:02.900 --> 22:07.940
Yeah, I think that it's really neat to think about robots.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.900
The great thing is then they change the guys over to the robot and you just notice.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.540
At first, I mean, there's this man, Carb Anderson, they take his software out and program it onto a machine.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.000
And initially he doesn't notice the difference.

22:26.480 --> 22:32.260
There's a big collection by Douglas Hofstetter and Daniel Dennett called The Lion's Eye.

22:32.660 --> 22:35.300
It came out this fall from basic books.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.940
And they have a whole lot of essays about these kinds of questions.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.880
They have a section of software in there.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.300
Which section did they have?

22:47.200 --> 22:52.800
Well, I think they had the first two chapters introducing Carb Anderson.

22:53.560 --> 22:59.320
And then they jumped up to where Ralph Numbis is on the moon and where he gets sat.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.700
And then, you know, Innocence dies.

23:06.100 --> 23:10.980
I would think that a lot of what Hofstetter does would be interesting to you.

23:11.640 --> 23:16.040
Oh yeah, yeah, I've talked to him a couple of times. I really respect what he's done.

23:19.800 --> 23:24.520
I hope my book Infinity and the Mind can do as well as you know.

23:24.760 --> 23:25.780
Good, I should love it.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.880
Well, a mere Pulitzer Prize.

23:31.780 --> 23:34.740
Yeah, well, I'll settle for $210 now.

23:35.620 --> 23:36.940
I don't have to get the prize.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.360
That's even better, isn't it?

23:38.860 --> 23:39.040
Yeah.

23:41.060 --> 23:50.740
All of your writing seems to imply to me that the world has a character of the Everett Wheeler Graham universe.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.200
Yeah, I mean that's something I've always been really into.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.800
I read that stuff a long time ago.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.340
And that there are many universes.

24:05.000 --> 24:05.300
Huh?

24:06.020 --> 24:07.040
Sure, I don't know.

24:08.100 --> 24:13.240
This one universe, it does seem to exist in a very definite stubborn way.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.480
To me, that's one of the really confusing things.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.620
That's one of the problems that I can't understand.

24:19.920 --> 24:24.360
Why it is that if there are many universes, why doesn't it feel so much like we're just in one?

24:26.680 --> 24:29.180
That's actually an aspect of the problem.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.740
It's an ancient problem called the one many problem.

24:33.060 --> 24:37.800
In a way, any problem I've ever been interested in boils down to the one many problem.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.360
How can the world be both one thing and many things?

24:45.360 --> 24:50.760
With your training in math and physics and the obvious reading that you do,

24:51.000 --> 24:56.560
you've got to have a gut feeling about what is reality, that sort of thing.

24:56.800 --> 25:02.000
Do you think that Everett Wheeler Graham model is what describes reality?

25:03.060 --> 25:05.000
It's fun to write about.

25:05.940 --> 25:06.900
Uh huh.

25:06.900 --> 25:10.520
I don't believe as much as I used to though.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.080
In fact, Wheeler himself doesn't believe it very much anymore.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.320
He's written some papers since then.

25:19.640 --> 25:24.360
I don't really think that there are all those other universes really spinning themselves in.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.420
I don't know.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.520
I mean, what I think the world is, it varies from time to time.

25:34.540 --> 25:36.480
I really couldn't tell you what I think.

25:40.520 --> 25:47.680
Let's say you're gainfully employed at a university and you're writing.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.800
How do you juggle your schedule?

25:51.680 --> 25:54.000
Well, there's a lot of time in the summer.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.080
You get a lot of vacations in the summer.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.200
What's generally off?

25:59.680 --> 26:07.820
Well, I'm not really, I mean, before I had the, when I was in Heidelberg for those two years,

26:07.820 --> 26:11.560
I basically had no obligations at all.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.300
There was like just no strength at all.

26:14.380 --> 26:17.020
And there I just wrote like nine to four every day.

26:19.560 --> 26:22.240
And, or well, ten to three, whatever.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.980
And so there was pretty easy.

26:26.180 --> 26:33.760
And now here, I've been working in Lynchburg at Randolph-Macon, Randolph-Macon Women's College.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.620
I teach all girls.

26:38.660 --> 26:44.620
And I teach, well, in the summer I write and I write in the afternoons.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.400
Like, I really like to write.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.860
I'd rather write than anything else.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.660
I mean, within reason.

26:51.340 --> 26:55.020
It's basically, it's just something, some free time I would rather write.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.360
And so I find time for it.

26:58.800 --> 27:02.340
That's the thing, if you really want to write more than anything, then you can always find time for it.

27:02.340 --> 27:06.820
And you don't even have to have like a whole long time to do it.

27:06.860 --> 27:07.980
And you don't even have to feel like writing.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.620
You just, you know, you've got to sit down.

27:11.300 --> 27:12.940
If you have an hour you'll be.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.160
If you write a page, well that's, you know, that's a page that you've got to write.

27:19.460 --> 27:29.020
Do you have girls in your classes that ask what higher order calculus has to do with teaching great school kids how to, how to learn?

27:29.620 --> 27:31.320
I remember that scene from White Light.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.360
Oh, that was more at the other place I taught at Geneseo.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.940
Because there were a lot of people that were being trained to be elementary school teachers.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.620
That's not so much of a factor here.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.800
Yeah, I used to be asked that.

27:45.020 --> 27:45.640
And I don't know.

27:46.340 --> 27:48.100
Well, they would say, well, why should we learn this?

27:48.220 --> 27:49.500
But, you know, why should you learn anything?

27:50.160 --> 27:58.860
I mean, if you get like so materialistic, the only reason to learn anything is to produce machines that make consumer goods.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.080
You know, what about art?

28:01.320 --> 28:01.860
What about literature?

28:02.380 --> 28:03.300
What about mathematics?

28:04.140 --> 28:05.400
What about pure science?

28:06.300 --> 28:07.020
What about everything?

28:07.980 --> 28:10.880
It's just too, I mean, why do we do anything?

28:11.120 --> 28:11.820
We're going to die anyway.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.220
It's just, you know, have some fun.

28:17.040 --> 28:20.720
Your books are liberally peppered with references to rock music.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.340
Some more than others.

28:22.340 --> 28:24.720
With the obvious zappa and the stones.

28:25.140 --> 28:30.340
And then I noticed some oblique references to Country Joe and the stones and the fugs.

28:32.180 --> 28:34.540
Obviously rock music means a great deal to you.

28:34.840 --> 28:35.960
I must have influenced you.

28:36.320 --> 28:37.520
Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.720
It's, you know, it just always meant so much to me.

28:42.280 --> 28:46.200
Like when I see the stones, I've been to see them three or four times.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.460
I didn't get to see them the same way.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.720
It's like the only time I've ever been in a crowd,

28:52.120 --> 28:55.120
and there was somebody standing in the front of the crowd with a microphone,

28:55.780 --> 28:57.560
that I didn't basically want to shoot.

28:58.940 --> 29:02.040
I mean, that was somebody that I really felt like following.

29:03.560 --> 29:08.420
You know, I mean, I just really, they're just saying what's true and what's good,

29:08.620 --> 29:10.260
and nobody could ever stop them.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.400
It's just so great, you know.

29:12.400 --> 29:17.520
Like there's all the establishment and trying to keep everybody down,

29:17.820 --> 29:20.660
and trying to deny that anybody has an individual consciousness,

29:20.920 --> 29:24.380
or is really aware and having thoughts.

29:24.980 --> 29:28.260
Just, you know, whim, you know, like just play it as loud as you want to,

29:28.620 --> 29:31.020
and everybody digs it and they can't stop.

29:32.040 --> 29:37.960
I think it's, rock music is like the greatest thing.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.720
You said that you had seen the Stones in Buffalo,

29:42.800 --> 29:47.140
and that inspired you to write what became space-time donuts

29:47.140 --> 29:49.440
because you wanted to write an anarchic novel.

29:50.300 --> 29:53.680
Does the music, is it kind of a subliminal message,

29:54.020 --> 29:58.440
or a write hemisphere message, or what, that gets to you,

29:58.480 --> 29:59.640
that makes you want to write like that?

30:01.060 --> 30:02.340
Well, I don't know.

30:02.500 --> 30:06.020
I mean, sometimes I'm writing well, I think it's like good guitar playing.

30:07.120 --> 30:11.500
With this, you have like little surprises in each sense,

30:11.880 --> 30:13.440
and the choice of words that are surprising.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.820
And like tasty, tasty riffs.

30:23.040 --> 30:26.020
Do you feel any pressure being the great, great, great,

30:26.580 --> 30:28.740
how many greats is it, grandson of Hegel?

30:30.380 --> 30:34.920
Well, I think I've done my part, you know, for the absolute.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.780
I really, I'd like to read his stuff, and it's pretty hard to read.

30:40.460 --> 30:43.640
I've read books about him, but the actual books are very hard to read.

30:44.160 --> 30:49.780
But it's my impression that I have somewhat the same ideas about the absolute,

30:50.680 --> 30:54.060
the absolute being, the ultimate thing, the white line.

30:55.580 --> 30:59.760
And I would say, you know, like later people would look back and say,

30:59.760 --> 31:03.920
well, it's pretty much where Hegel would have wanted to write.

31:04.220 --> 31:05.340
It seems like that's the expression there.

31:07.880 --> 31:12.340
Was the white light the title itself, or the concept, the naming of the concept,

31:12.480 --> 31:16.520
was that inspired by the life after life thing where they talked about the...

31:16.520 --> 31:17.100
Well, I've done it all, though.

31:17.180 --> 31:19.540
I never read either one of those books that he put on the cover.

31:19.860 --> 31:20.760
I couldn't believe that.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.980
On the cover of white light, he mentioned like Jonathan Livingston's Seagull,

31:25.200 --> 31:26.420
and life after life.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.440
I mean, that was just unbelievable.

31:28.440 --> 31:29.500
That was a good name.

31:30.460 --> 31:33.460
No, I mean, what white light, that's like in the 60s when,

31:34.220 --> 31:39.000
if you took like a whole lot of LSD, everything would get all white, you know,

31:39.880 --> 31:41.740
and then God would talk to you.

31:42.760 --> 31:47.160
And that was like an experience that usually you would only get it once,

31:47.500 --> 31:50.800
because you'd look out for it the other time.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.640
That's very white light.

31:56.420 --> 31:59.560
One other influence I want to ask you about, because it's mentioned in the book,

31:59.880 --> 32:03.280
is it mentioned you'd talked to Gertle several times.

32:04.940 --> 32:10.080
Was that quite an experience for you to talk to somebody of that stature?

32:10.880 --> 32:12.920
Oh, yeah, I mean, that was...

32:12.920 --> 32:16.240
For me, he was like the ultimate guru that I ever met in my life.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.760
I just, you know...

32:18.760 --> 32:23.340
I was fortunate, you know, I got to see the master at that formative stage in my life.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.600
And again, that tends to be the one time thing.

32:28.620 --> 32:30.200
I mean, at this point, he's dead.

32:32.280 --> 32:35.420
You know, when I'm an old man, maybe somebody will come see me or something,

32:35.680 --> 32:39.200
but I don't expect to meet anybody like that again.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.920
Yeah, he was just...

32:44.480 --> 32:49.060
I wrote an article about him for Science 82.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.580
Science. I guess they'll put it out at that point.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.240
And, Don...

32:55.240 --> 32:57.700
I'll think about Gertle when you talked to him.

32:57.700 --> 33:01.520
When I would talk to him, I'd make up a list of questions I wanted to ask him about all this stuff.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.140
About math and philosophy and physics and stuff.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.680
And I keep it sitting alone in Princeton there,

33:09.840 --> 33:11.160
like for 30 years.

33:11.520 --> 33:15.520
And like 30 years ago, he had proved the heaviest things that anybody had ever done in mathematics.

33:16.380 --> 33:18.420
He'd been like 30 years past that.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.400
He was thinking all the time.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.660
And anything I'd ask him, you know, like he'd already been all the way down the road.

33:25.640 --> 33:26.780
And he would just laugh.

33:27.340 --> 33:30.180
I mean, a lot of when I would talk to him, he'd say a few words and then he'd start laughing.

33:30.780 --> 33:32.020
And I'd start laughing with him.

33:33.180 --> 33:37.100
And like as we would laugh, I would feel like we were communicating.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.580
It was awesome.

33:39.340 --> 33:42.120
I mean, it sounds kind of stupid when I say it like this, but awesome.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.000
It was, you know, like a real feeling of telepathy almost.

33:45.700 --> 33:48.180
Like, you know, anything I would say you totally understand.

33:49.180 --> 33:53.120
It's just really unquestionably the greatest personal effort.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.240
What are your plans now?

33:58.760 --> 34:00.380
You've apparently finished sex fear.

34:00.800 --> 34:04.000
Any concrete ideas on what you're going to do next?

34:04.740 --> 34:08.000
Well, yeah, this year I'm going to need money.

34:08.420 --> 34:11.440
So I'm probably going to try to write a couple novels this year.

34:12.540 --> 34:13.700
I started a story.

34:13.940 --> 34:15.360
I wrote a story called The Bearish Up.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.580
And I sent it to Anaheim.

34:17.400 --> 34:21.160
And then I talked to Stan Schmidt and he said, well, no, you have a good ending.

34:22.160 --> 34:25.800
And then I wrote more and I kind of doubled the length.

34:25.940 --> 34:29.380
And now I think, well, I'll just make it into a novel.

34:30.360 --> 34:34.220
And this is not going to be, this would be more like sort of a software type of,

34:34.220 --> 34:39.740
where I'm not trying to go all out and break the back of the absolute bear of my soul.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.400
Or I could just, you know, write some entertaining science fiction.

34:43.620 --> 34:48.240
And so I may end up, you know, doing some stuff.

34:49.180 --> 34:53.640
I'd like to have like giant leeches invading Lynchburg and stuff like that.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.740
So I'll probably do that.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.880
And I could probably finish that by this summer.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.700
And also I'm working on a book called All the Visions.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.360
And All the Visions.

35:06.140 --> 35:10.220
I want to sort of write down all my memories or all the visions of him.

35:11.040 --> 35:11.720
Write them down.

35:13.080 --> 35:17.160
And perhaps it depends, whatever, making science fiction.

35:17.680 --> 35:21.620
In any case, change it so it's not really true.

35:23.660 --> 35:27.340
But depending, sex here, I have some hope I can sell it mainstream.

35:27.340 --> 35:28.940
I can sell it mainstream.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.460
I'll make all the visions mainstream.

35:31.280 --> 35:34.000
If I can, then I'll make all the visions science fiction.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.500
And after that, I'd like to do a sequel to this software.

35:39.620 --> 35:40.880
Probably call it Hardware.

35:41.900 --> 35:45.220
About where the robots start building the bodies of people as well.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.580
Because to settle some things.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.320
And maybe a science book.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.900
Your first book really hit with a bang.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.840
Because on the second and third books, all they do is talk about the first one.

36:04.860 --> 36:08.720
Would it bother you if that first one was what you were known for

36:08.720 --> 36:12.500
and anything else you wrote after that, people would always compare it to that

36:12.500 --> 36:16.760
or say, well, gee, it never was quite as original or whatever.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.900
Does it do worry about things like that?

36:19.220 --> 36:20.040
Well, sure, yeah.

36:20.040 --> 36:20.880
I don't really get that.

36:21.560 --> 36:26.520
Well, I see myself as writing two screens of books.

36:27.800 --> 36:28.380
I kind of alternate.

36:29.260 --> 36:34.540
I mean, I think the sex sphere is a book like White Line.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.920
It's real big, real heavy.

36:37.640 --> 36:41.600
And two software, that was taking a little more years on that.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.460
And now I'm going to do, I just did a heavy book, now I'm going to take it easy.

36:45.460 --> 36:47.280
And then do a nurse.

36:47.620 --> 36:49.280
Now do all the visions that will be real heavy.

36:50.220 --> 36:52.220
So my feeling is to all make that before.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.060
Well, which one I'll be known for?

36:57.780 --> 36:58.140
I don't know.

36:58.860 --> 37:00.480
You know, each person takes their own favorite.

37:01.740 --> 37:05.180
If, you know, if one book, if people like it enough to look at the others,

37:05.800 --> 37:06.840
they can decide who it's about.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.200
Okay, that's it.

37:13.420 --> 37:15.560
We appreciate the chance to get to talk to you.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.580
Okay, well, that's fun, though.

37:17.780 --> 37:23.240
Yeah, I read the second two because I like the first one and I like them a lot.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.300
And I plan to read them.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.220
Lots of luck and all that good stuff.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.020
I look forward to what's coming out.

37:30.060 --> 37:32.900
You say the article on Gertle is going to be in Science 82?

37:33.580 --> 37:35.780
Yeah, that would be out this summer, so.

37:35.880 --> 37:36.440
Okay, good.

37:36.540 --> 37:37.040
I get it.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.800
And so I'll have to take a look at that.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.980
And I have an anthology of stories out for the A's next winter.

37:45.140 --> 37:45.920
These are your stories?

37:46.080 --> 37:46.260
Yeah.

37:47.260 --> 37:49.280
It'll be called The 57th's Friends' Casket.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.920
Okay, it's been alright.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.400
I enjoyed it.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.040
It's, I guess, part of the residence.

37:59.180 --> 38:01.340
I guess I'm a couple of years younger than you are.

38:01.480 --> 38:05.500
And so it's, you know, it kind of went through the same times.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.420
I can remember some of those times.

38:07.420 --> 38:10.160
And it's quite enjoyable to read it.

38:11.020 --> 38:13.000
Everybody hasn't been co-opted.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.220
Yeah, that's good to hear.

38:15.340 --> 38:20.100
Okay, thanks again and we'll talk to you later then.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.440
Okay, bye-bye.
