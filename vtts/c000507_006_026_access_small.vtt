00:01.360 --> 00:04.400
But actually, Ellen, a lot of people are moving back into the country.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.920
Young people, an amazing number of young people.

00:08.160 --> 00:08.620
How long ago?

00:08.620 --> 00:10.940
And how come the cities continue to grow larger?

00:11.380 --> 00:12.780
Well, a lot of them are losing population.

00:13.340 --> 00:13.620
Are they?

00:13.780 --> 00:13.980
Well.

00:14.060 --> 00:14.420
Which ones?

00:15.100 --> 00:16.340
New York City is losing.

00:17.040 --> 00:17.880
Little one is losing.

00:18.040 --> 00:18.700
Area is losing.

00:18.940 --> 00:21.180
Yes, but are they losing population to the country?

00:21.220 --> 00:25.340
Are they losing populations to places like San Diego and Portland and Boise, Idaho?

00:25.740 --> 00:26.560
I don't know.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.160
California is losing population.

00:28.160 --> 00:32.680
There are fewer people coming in now than are leaving it.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.440
But I mean, I know from, partly from what I've read and partly from my own observation,

00:37.720 --> 00:43.300
that old houses, for instance, in the country that were abandoned, have been bought and fixed

00:43.300 --> 00:44.520
up and people are living in them.

00:44.620 --> 00:49.980
The quality of life in the cities is such that they don't see any reason why they have

00:49.980 --> 00:51.480
to live that way.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.120
So they're moving out where there's some clean air and they can have a little garden

00:54.120 --> 00:54.400
patch.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.980
And everybody's got television these days and you have an automobile so that you can

00:58.980 --> 00:59.400
get about.

00:59.820 --> 01:05.900
And all these places are, at least in the east, are within reach of some center where

01:05.900 --> 01:09.440
there are cultural theaters and stores, one thing and another.

01:10.700 --> 01:15.400
If that's the key point, I think, I'd be very interested to see some statistics on how many

01:15.400 --> 01:22.560
people are moving to the country within, say, a radius of a two-hour drive of a large cultural

01:22.560 --> 01:23.040
center.

01:23.040 --> 01:23.700
And there are a lot of books being...

01:23.700 --> 01:25.540
Or how many are moving to the real country?

01:26.800 --> 01:31.360
Way, way out, say, in the wilds of Nevada or Nebraska for that matter.

01:31.380 --> 01:32.300
Well, that isn't country.

01:32.480 --> 01:33.400
That's something else again.

01:33.880 --> 01:38.700
A lot of people, I mean, you know, move to the desert or someplace like that, which is

01:38.700 --> 01:39.880
extremely isolated.

01:40.020 --> 01:44.860
But I'm speaking now of just what you generally call, you know, a farming country.

01:45.360 --> 01:51.960
My ideal situation would be to live in a place like Big Sur or Montana, but be within easy

01:51.960 --> 01:55.640
commuting distance of New York and London and Los Angeles and San Francisco.

01:56.020 --> 01:57.180
You need a much smaller planet.

01:57.500 --> 01:57.740
Yes.

01:59.140 --> 02:01.560
Or a much more efficient transportation system.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.860
Yeah, that is what we really need.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.600
And I've seen designs for them.

02:06.360 --> 02:11.340
Trains that go 300 miles per hour, and you never decelerate the engine.

02:11.900 --> 02:18.740
You accelerate the cars up to the 300 and attach them to the engine and detach them later.

02:19.480 --> 02:26.240
You've got a large mesh network of 300 mile per hour trains and a smaller mesh network

02:26.240 --> 02:32.800
of trains that do 100 and an even smaller mesh of trains that do 30 miles per hour.

02:33.280 --> 02:39.140
And you set up the mesh so that a train is only a five minute walk from anywhere.

02:40.320 --> 02:45.440
Now you map out the area of the country available to you within an hour of traveling.

02:45.960 --> 02:51.200
And even including two five minute walks, it becomes tremendous, much larger than anything

02:51.200 --> 02:52.140
available to us.

02:52.560 --> 02:59.540
In fact, the culture available to a man who has access to that network is a lot greater

02:59.540 --> 03:04.340
than the culture available to a New Yorker, even if the country is spread out with a population

03:04.340 --> 03:05.480
density like Kansas.

03:06.060 --> 03:10.700
I think what we're seeing is not the elimination of cities, but just a change in their function.

03:11.280 --> 03:11.520
Right.

03:11.620 --> 03:14.420
I think they reached the point of megalopolis.

03:14.420 --> 03:19.320
I mean, they couldn't, you know, they were just too big and had to simmer down again.

03:32.240 --> 03:37.900
The subject of huge populations and the attending systems needed to service them brings up a

03:37.900 --> 03:42.880
point which science fiction authors Alan Dean Foster, Lee Brackett and Larry Niven find

03:42.880 --> 03:43.540
fascinating.

03:44.160 --> 03:48.760
It concerns a pollutant and its role in controlling a powerful natural phenomenon.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.120
Larry Niven follows it through.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.720
Anybody here in favor of heat pollution?

03:54.040 --> 03:56.000
Depending on the recovery system, yes.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.360
Yeah, I'm kind of in favor of it tentatively.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.100
We need no more.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.740
But if Mars just went into an ice age, it may be that we just went into an ice age and

04:06.740 --> 04:09.460
it's only heat pollution that is keeping us from the glaciers.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.020
That's an interesting possibility.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.960
I don't know why it would affect one planet and not another.

04:14.140 --> 04:17.880
I mean, presumably we both circle the same sun.

04:18.360 --> 04:18.860
That's what I mean.

04:19.420 --> 04:26.300
And the recent experiments done to detect neutrinos coming from the sun have found far

04:26.300 --> 04:26.920
too few.

04:27.180 --> 04:31.200
It's as if the fusion process inside the sun has stopped for a while.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.640
That could be a frightening thought.

04:33.740 --> 04:38.060
It isn't as if the sun is going to stop shining because it isn't as if it could cool off all

04:38.060 --> 04:38.440
at once.

04:38.920 --> 04:45.720
I'm in favor of good old mother nature being far greater menace to mankind than man is.

04:46.880 --> 04:47.340
Are you?

04:47.680 --> 04:52.960
I think mankind has been the biggest force for evolution on Earth for a long time.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.320
Oh, yes, for evolution.

04:54.480 --> 05:02.320
But what I mean is that the natural disasters that have been visited upon the globe of, as

05:02.320 --> 05:07.740
you were saying, if the sun has cooled down, this is sort of beyond our capacity to do.

05:07.740 --> 05:13.060
If spray cans could wipe out the ozone layer, the volcanoes of the Earth would have wiped

05:13.060 --> 05:16.280
out the ozone layer a lot sooner, Niven's law.

05:17.060 --> 05:21.060
One thing I think Lester mentioned is that science fiction, there was a great deal of

05:21.060 --> 05:22.200
talk about adaptation.

05:23.460 --> 05:27.540
And I think science fiction is the literature of adaptation as opposed to, say, the literature

05:27.540 --> 05:28.340
of reaction.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.000
I agree.

05:30.420 --> 05:35.300
I think the important thing about science fiction right from the beginning is not whether

05:35.300 --> 05:41.680
or not the predictions were accurate in themselves, but that the predictions were made, which

05:41.680 --> 05:48.740
kind of stretched people's minds, some of them, beyond the point where their entire

05:48.740 --> 05:51.920
life was encompassed by getting up in the morning and going to work and going to bed

05:51.920 --> 05:52.280
at night.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.460
And they never thought about anything beyond the next fence post.

05:56.720 --> 06:03.360
The idea of spaceflight, the idea of other worlds, the idea of other forms of life opening

06:03.360 --> 06:08.960
up all this enormous possibility and the conception of atomic power and the conception

06:09.800 --> 06:10.260
of...

06:10.260 --> 06:10.960
Anti-gravity.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.100
Right, anti-gravity.

06:12.100 --> 06:12.880
If you're not going to unload the dice.

06:13.220 --> 06:17.060
Yeah, which hasn't come true yet, but it, who knows, and I notice that they're even

06:17.060 --> 06:20.020
talking about the FTL drivers, so it might just be possible.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.780
Both of these seem unlikely.

06:22.340 --> 06:27.060
Yeah, well, yes, they seem unlikely, but what I'm driving at is that it got people thinking,

06:27.060 --> 06:33.940
which I think is a lot more important than whether Jules Verne's submarine, the Nautilus,

06:34.020 --> 06:38.040
actually could ever have sailed or not.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.140
There were submarines before Jules Verne...

06:40.140 --> 06:40.560
Oh, I'm sure there were.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.920
...and he didn't even include a periscope.

06:43.200 --> 06:43.500
Mm-hmm.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.620
But he did have beautifully upholstered furniture and an organ.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.260
Can't beat that.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.700
Science fiction writers on a whole tend to be very good interior decorators.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.240
Yeah.

06:55.120 --> 07:02.400
As opposed to the spaceships you see on TV, the big message throughout science fiction,

07:02.800 --> 07:04.080
I only found one.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.880
It is there are people who don't think like you do, and they are as right as you are.

07:09.180 --> 07:09.400
Right.

07:10.300 --> 07:14.700
Yeah, science fiction was the only thing I read, or I can remember reading in high school,

07:15.320 --> 07:18.080
that demanded that I think...

07:18.080 --> 07:18.320
Yeah.

07:18.620 --> 07:22.220
There were other stories that made me think, but science fiction was the only thing I read

07:22.220 --> 07:24.880
that said, now think about this or else.

07:25.560 --> 07:25.820
Mm-hmm.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.540
And it was a wonderful discovery.

07:29.500 --> 07:36.100
Anyone want to disagree with Lester and Fred's opinion of man's adaptability?

07:37.060 --> 07:38.160
I don't myself.

07:39.020 --> 07:42.160
No, I think man is enormously adaptable.

07:42.500 --> 07:47.920
And of course, if you want to quibble, I think Fred's contention was that man adapted his

07:47.920 --> 07:50.180
environment to suit himself.

07:50.820 --> 07:55.660
Well, I suppose in other words, you clobber another animal and take his skin rather than

07:55.660 --> 07:56.620
growing for yourself.

07:57.020 --> 08:02.020
You capture wolves and grow them into dogs to protect you instead of attacking you.

08:02.260 --> 08:02.840
Yes, right.

08:03.360 --> 08:07.760
So, I suppose that that's true, but that in itself is pretty much an adaptability trait,

08:07.880 --> 08:08.360
I would think.

08:09.100 --> 08:09.500
Mm-hmm.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.340
In the long run, no, I agree with you.

08:12.680 --> 08:19.380
In the short run, I worry about something called the tyranny of the minority, that our

08:19.380 --> 08:24.180
institutions have developed in such a way that small interest groups can frustrate any

08:24.180 --> 08:24.920
kind of progress.

08:25.140 --> 08:25.640
Well, this is true.

08:26.100 --> 08:30.180
I was speaking merely of man in the sort of primitive state.

08:30.520 --> 08:34.280
In other words, it managed to survive the Ice Age and survive a lot of other things.

08:34.560 --> 08:40.720
In post-atomic times or following, I think any natural calamity, you're still going to

08:40.720 --> 08:46.120
have a certain number of people left who will in some way adapt to whatever they have to

08:46.120 --> 08:46.260
do.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.720
And you, had you given any thought to the tyranny of the majority, Alan?

08:50.940 --> 08:51.600
Yes, yes.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.520
It's kind of hard to think of one without the other.

08:53.660 --> 08:53.980
Yes.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.740
And being in the minority, it's impossible to think of one without the other.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.880
I doubt any Mormon has ever forgotten the possibility.

09:02.260 --> 09:02.480
Mm-hmm.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.980
How about terraforming Mars?

09:04.680 --> 09:07.780
Lee, they keep changing your Mars on you.

09:08.220 --> 09:09.920
How about changing it back, huh?

09:11.520 --> 09:13.420
Well, I would adore doing that.

09:13.940 --> 09:17.340
I don't know that my Mars would be a terribly pleasant place to live either.

09:17.500 --> 09:21.940
It was pretty chilly and windy and dusty, as I recall it, and very much on the ragged

09:21.940 --> 09:22.180
edge.

09:22.460 --> 09:25.860
But the air could be breathed by strong, strong enough people?

09:26.040 --> 09:32.100
Yes, it was a bit thin, but it was breathable, which I believe is actually not over a long

09:32.100 --> 09:33.020
period of time.

09:33.760 --> 09:33.940
Mm-hmm.

09:33.960 --> 09:39.580
My understanding, I may be wrong on that, but you could get away without life support.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.340
All right.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.320
There are ways to make a pleasanter Mars.

09:43.660 --> 09:44.600
Oh, yes, surely there are.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.080
Terraforming Venus has also got its possibilities.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.520
I wouldn't want to bet on that one.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.060
I wouldn't either.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.740
I'm fascinated by the possibility, but I don't know.

09:55.400 --> 10:00.860
I had a character speculating once that what we need to terraform Venus is a big anti-gravity

10:00.860 --> 10:06.080
generator that would send a plume of the atmosphere out into space to be blown away until we're

10:06.080 --> 10:08.120
down to a breathable atmosphere.

10:08.120 --> 10:12.040
Well Carl Sagan's idea was that you seed the atmosphere with algae.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.800
Yeah, this seems easier.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.200
Uh-huh.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.480
The way he put it, it sounded very, very practical.

10:17.620 --> 10:20.920
Yeah, I've seen these plants and sure they look practical, but what have you got when

10:20.920 --> 10:21.360
you finished?

10:22.020 --> 10:28.620
A slightly lighter planet with a quite heavy, thick atmosphere under a quite hot sun, nearby

10:28.620 --> 10:29.160
sun.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.240
Uh, Mars sounds more attractive.

10:31.860 --> 10:35.440
There obviously has been water on the surface, fluid water.

10:35.760 --> 10:35.980
Yeah.

10:35.980 --> 10:39.100
We've got the braided water courses and the erosions.

10:39.460 --> 10:45.700
Arthur Clark spoke of igniting a fusion plant on, say, Phobos, so that you've got a fairly

10:45.700 --> 10:48.640
tiny sun fairly close in as well as the big sun.

10:48.780 --> 10:49.080
Uh-huh.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.340
That would warm up Mars.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.660
You'd get the water melted.

10:53.260 --> 10:57.100
If you need more, it could possibly be imported from Earth or from Saturn's rings.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.140
Uh-huh.

10:59.140 --> 11:07.000
The chief problem's always seen at least according to Edgar Rice Burroughs, who presuppose atmosphere

11:07.000 --> 11:13.280
plants, if you remember, because the light gravity of the planet permits a good bit of

11:13.280 --> 11:15.540
the atmosphere to leak away into space, doesn't hold it.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.520
Of course, he was right as far as that goes.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.140
Yeah, a problem you're always going to have with you.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.900
The problem with Mars is nobody ever built the atmosphere plants yet.

11:24.280 --> 11:24.480
Right.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.860
So, perhaps we'll get to that anyway.

11:29.040 --> 11:33.740
Nobody ever seems to mention Titan in all of these possible discussions.

11:34.660 --> 11:40.620
I think it's going to be very interesting when the, what is it, the latest non-mariner,

11:41.040 --> 11:48.320
but Explorer shoots by on the, perhaps it is Mariner, shoots by after its next flyby,

11:48.420 --> 11:52.160
close by look at Jupiter, and we're supposed to have our first close look at Titan, which

11:52.160 --> 11:54.620
of course has something of an interesting atmosphere.

11:55.060 --> 11:55.340
Yes.

11:56.280 --> 11:56.700
Mm-hmm.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.660
Although it's a bit too far away for comfort.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.200
Yeah, I never studied Titan.

12:02.340 --> 12:03.960
What's interesting about Titan?

12:04.700 --> 12:11.140
Well, that it apparently has an atmosphere which contains water vapor in it and a number

12:11.140 --> 12:16.380
of other things which could prove very useful, and the fact is we just don't know very much

12:16.380 --> 12:16.840
about it.

12:17.540 --> 12:17.940
Mm-hmm.

12:17.940 --> 12:23.860
And the mere fact that it has an atmosphere which is not primarily methane, and that it

12:23.860 --> 12:27.360
does have water vapor in it, opens up a whole host of intriguing possibilities.

12:27.940 --> 12:28.000
Mm-hmm.

12:28.180 --> 12:33.340
As I recall, a Titan is the largest moon in the system, in other words, is larger than

12:33.340 --> 12:37.520
Luna, so it'd be quite habitable if it were habitable.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.940
Genomy is larger than Luna.

12:40.140 --> 12:40.180
Yeah.

12:40.180 --> 12:42.900
There are a number of moons bigger than Luna.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.480
I didn't know Titan was the biggest.

12:45.040 --> 12:45.700
I think so.

12:46.420 --> 12:47.060
I think so.

12:47.060 --> 12:53.780
For that matter, there's the possibility of, well, but you still have the problem of terraforming

12:53.780 --> 12:58.940
if you put some large fusion motors on something like, well, on one of the smaller moons and

12:58.940 --> 13:00.120
move them closer to the sun.

13:01.440 --> 13:08.400
Well, I have every faith in the advance of technology because when I first started, see,

13:08.420 --> 13:09.760
I'm a lot older than you people are.

13:10.580 --> 13:15.260
And when I went to school, the atom was the smallest indivisible particle of matter which

13:15.260 --> 13:16.540
could never possibly be split.

13:17.180 --> 13:20.640
And I used to worry a great deal when I first started writing science fiction because of

13:20.640 --> 13:26.300
the heavy side layer which forever prohibited radio communication between Earth and a spaceship

13:26.860 --> 13:27.320
in orbit.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.380
And all these things seem to have fallen by the wayside.

13:30.960 --> 13:31.200
Yes.

13:31.200 --> 13:38.340
And sort of today's scientific absolute is tomorrow's, you know, solved problems.

13:38.660 --> 13:41.640
So I think ways will be found to do an awful lot of things.

13:42.600 --> 13:48.400
And oftentimes, if the, even just the theory has been propounded, sometimes you'd have

13:48.400 --> 13:50.160
to wait for the technology to catch up.

13:51.020 --> 13:56.200
Even so, it's not unreasonable to assume that the speed of light barrier can't be cracked.

13:57.120 --> 13:57.480
No.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.740
And you get interesting stories out of that one too.

14:00.080 --> 14:00.380
Yes.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.400
I always have written stories with a lot of action.

14:03.680 --> 14:04.640
And I like interstellar.

14:05.020 --> 14:10.740
I like to get out there and shoot the nebulae and, you know, go into the clusters and all

14:10.740 --> 14:15.620
these things, which to me is part of the whole pleasure of writing science fiction.

14:17.060 --> 14:22.140
This series that I'm doing for Ballantyne now, I've trod around a good bit throughout

14:22.140 --> 14:23.680
the galaxy.

14:24.940 --> 14:29.420
So of course, in a story like that, you use faster than light drives simply because, I

14:29.420 --> 14:31.760
mean, you just say that it's so and you use it.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.600
It's not an integral part of a story.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.740
It's merely a means of getting from point A to point B so that you can get on with your

14:36.740 --> 14:40.160
story because otherwise it would take you several thousand years and everybody'd be,

14:40.180 --> 14:41.840
you know, too old when they got there.

14:43.280 --> 14:49.900
But I notice that very reputable scientists are now beginning to challenge the speed of

14:49.900 --> 14:50.940
light barrier.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.940
This is certainly true.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.860
If the speed of light can be cracked, we're going to do it eventually.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.840
It's just too useful a possibility to ignore.

15:01.860 --> 15:05.860
Same statement applies to gravity, anti-gravity, generated gravity.

15:05.860 --> 15:11.100
Some things are unlikely to be true, but very useful if they are.

15:11.380 --> 15:11.840
That's right.

15:12.020 --> 15:17.140
And very often you find the fallout on the way to finding out, you know, testing it.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.300
Sometimes something happens that's even more useful than your original.

15:20.580 --> 15:23.700
The death ray now has had a lot of fallout.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.700
We never dreamed it would be so useful in so many ways when we spoke of colored beams

15:29.700 --> 15:35.060
of light that would cut through an enemy or an enemy's fortress for that matter.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.380
That Buck Rogers stuff they used to tell me when I was a kid.

15:38.640 --> 15:38.900
Right.

15:39.320 --> 15:39.840
Ridiculous.

15:40.400 --> 15:45.740
Now on the whole, you know, we tend to cling to the things we like in science fiction in

15:45.740 --> 15:49.860
the face of scientific developments unless they've been absolutely disproved.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.420
Your Mars being a good example.

15:52.200 --> 15:59.140
You were saying Larry, that you thought the science fiction writers nowadays know more

15:59.140 --> 16:01.700
than they did then about science.

16:01.700 --> 16:02.180
This is true.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.220
So does the audience.

16:03.220 --> 16:03.300
Yes.

16:03.820 --> 16:07.520
But I mean a lot more is known than when we started out.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.520
Even the newspaper reporters are bright now.

16:11.160 --> 16:15.920
But we made some terrible boobos about atomic power and what would happen if you started

16:15.920 --> 16:19.800
throwing atom bombs around, you know, and we know better now because it's actually

16:19.800 --> 16:20.220
happened.

16:20.860 --> 16:21.100
Yes.

16:21.220 --> 16:24.440
In those days you see you were dealing with something that didn't exist.

16:25.180 --> 16:25.440
Yes.

16:25.540 --> 16:29.480
I have a hunch someday someone will probably say the same thing about faster than light

16:29.480 --> 16:30.960
drive and anti-gravity.

16:31.760 --> 16:35.560
Probably enough I think one of the great advances in technology that we can look for

16:35.560 --> 16:41.120
in the next 40, 30 years is going to be in the technology of recovery systems, whether

16:41.120 --> 16:43.420
it's waste heat from atomic plants or paper bags.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.440
Whatever our recovery system is, they're going to take energy.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.160
Practically any form of turning garbage into something useful requires energy.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.440
That's why I'm pushing atomic plants.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.820
Well, I'm kind of a solar power above myself.

17:00.220 --> 17:00.740
All right.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.580
The Earth is only getting a certain amount of solar power.

17:03.920 --> 17:08.880
If we put up the O'Neill colonies we will also be able to put up solar power plants

17:08.880 --> 17:12.780
on the moon and beam the energy back to Earth via microwaves.

17:13.300 --> 17:19.700
Aside from that, atomic power is the only kind of power that doesn't originate with

17:19.700 --> 17:21.260
sunlight in one form or another.

17:21.260 --> 17:27.640
That can be used without polluting the atmosphere in one form or another.

17:27.860 --> 17:31.220
The third choice is to burn something, anything.

17:32.600 --> 17:32.940
Oil.

17:33.940 --> 17:35.940
Yeah, solar power of course is...

17:35.940 --> 17:37.120
Well there are other possibilities.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.980
Solar power originates with the sun and fine.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.400
We can use anything that originates with the sun including running rivers.

17:43.420 --> 17:47.560
Yes, there are other possibilities that are waiting for that new technology that hasn't

17:47.560 --> 17:48.480
been discovered yet.

17:48.480 --> 17:55.180
New Zealand, for example, gets approximately 7% of its electrical power from thermal sources.

17:55.800 --> 17:56.920
There's the possibility of...

17:56.920 --> 17:57.000
Geothermal?

17:57.400 --> 17:57.900
Geothermal.

17:58.360 --> 18:03.640
There's the possibility of tapping the Earth's heat for artificial geothermal power.

18:04.160 --> 18:08.660
There are far more efficient hydroelectric systems than we have in this country, but

18:08.660 --> 18:11.340
then we get back to the tyranny of the minority again.

18:12.660 --> 18:16.700
When is hydroelectric power valuable and when is a wild river valuable?

18:17.840 --> 18:18.340
Yeah.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.720
Both clean sources of power.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.420
Yeah, I can name you a clean source of power.

18:24.060 --> 18:28.160
It's the temperature difference between the top of an ocean and the bottom of an ocean.

18:28.540 --> 18:34.700
And I wouldn't think you would be lousing up the environment at all if you started making

18:34.700 --> 18:37.020
electrical energy out of that temperature difference.

18:37.020 --> 18:37.440
Absolutely.

18:38.100 --> 18:42.380
But this again, this all requires technology that hasn't been developed yet to be efficient.

18:42.380 --> 18:47.500
If we could get fusion that was good enough, that would really be it.

18:47.820 --> 18:48.820
Yes, fusion would be nice.

18:49.060 --> 18:50.040
Fusion would be nice.

18:50.320 --> 18:57.040
We're dissociating seawater to get oxygen, which is good, burning the hydrogen for fusion

18:57.040 --> 19:00.600
and getting enormous energy out of it, which is good.

19:01.100 --> 19:05.240
And the result is helium, which we sell for diragibles, right?

19:05.820 --> 19:06.160
Right.

19:06.260 --> 19:06.760
Which is good.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.820
There are things about the diragible that I love.

19:10.460 --> 19:11.840
And here's one.

19:12.640 --> 19:16.900
On an airplane, the problem is people per value.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.280
The closer you pack the people, the more efficient the airplane becomes.

19:22.060 --> 19:25.820
But if you do that on a diragible, it's the mass aboard that counts.

19:26.580 --> 19:34.140
I can see a thin-skinned diragible, maybe a couple of skins, but both very thin and very strong.

19:35.500 --> 19:43.740
And lightweight floors, say foam plastic in spots and some metal cores to hold them together.

19:44.680 --> 19:51.000
And you inflate the whole thing with an oxy-helium mixture, and you don't populate just a gondola underneath,

19:51.200 --> 19:52.820
you populate the whole diragible.

19:53.560 --> 20:00.620
But you can't allow population density to rise so high, so there's endless room throughout this thing.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.260
Disneyland in the sky.

20:02.680 --> 20:02.840
Yeah.

20:03.980 --> 20:07.840
Can they be made rigid enough to...

20:08.540 --> 20:09.380
I don't know.

20:09.580 --> 20:13.200
All I know is our building materials get better and better.

20:13.260 --> 20:13.400
I know.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.420
We get closer and closer to bologna.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.020
Much better alloys than there were.

20:18.140 --> 20:21.800
I remember seeing the Shenandoah when she came out here.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.260
Beautiful, beautiful thing, just incredibly beautiful,

20:24.380 --> 20:27.340
standing there and watching her sail over the Santa Monica's and over the ocean.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.300
And she didn't last long thereafter.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.700
And it seemed they all came to rather sad ends.

20:34.040 --> 20:40.440
There's the Hindenburg saddest of all, but they all seem to go down in storms or break up or something.

20:40.560 --> 20:41.620
They were used to death.

20:42.020 --> 20:42.860
Oh yeah, of course they were.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.400
You keep using a diragible until it breaks over, it goes down in storms.

20:47.340 --> 20:52.100
I suspect that those were the old days before anyone painted plumesal lines on ships.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.140
You remember what that was for?

20:54.280 --> 20:58.880
People would take out vast amounts of insurance and then load their ships to the gunnels.

20:58.880 --> 21:03.200
And if the ships made port fine, if they didn't, there was a big profit in it.

21:03.300 --> 21:05.920
No, the plumesal mark went back a long time before that.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.780
Okay, I was never that much good at history.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.900
But the way of thinking was still there.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.920
There were no consumer protest groups.

21:14.620 --> 21:20.720
Well, I'm of the opinion that, if I were a poet of what Fred and Lester were talking about,

21:21.120 --> 21:26.440
that we have, as far as getting out into space, one of two choices.

21:26.440 --> 21:34.560
I mean, we can either go out and go ahead and keep growing or else we're going to have to pull in our ears on this planet.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.680
The resources are out there.

21:37.980 --> 21:39.140
The resources are out there.

21:39.740 --> 21:43.180
Just the business of living on the Blohmann thing for all this length of time.

21:43.760 --> 21:52.580
One of the most horrendous experiences I had to seeing what time has done to a place flying down from Baghdad to Basra

21:53.300 --> 22:00.140
and looking down on that land that has been cultivated under irrigation for six, seven, eight thousand years.

22:00.800 --> 22:05.520
And everywhere you look, the whole land is white with a salt scurve and nothing grows on it.

22:05.880 --> 22:13.580
And there's not a Blohmann thing you can do about it because, altering those millennia, the chemicals from the irrigation canals,

22:13.620 --> 22:16.080
have been building up in the soil.

22:16.640 --> 22:20.360
And I see the first hint of that beginning down in the Imperial Valley now when you drive through.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.900
You see these areas of white scurve.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.180
Apparently the water down there is even more saline.

22:26.940 --> 22:35.440
It isn't a matter really of abuse or, oh well good Lord knows we have abuse things, but the earth has an enormous capacity to recover.

22:47.220 --> 22:52.380
And now, new horizons are being explored for mankind's care and survival.

22:53.020 --> 23:02.700
Something Lee Brackett, Alan Dean Foster, Larry Niven, Lester Del Ray, Frederick Poe, and science fiction authors like them have been doing for years.

23:05.400 --> 23:05.900
Music

23:17.100 --> 23:21.640
The Mars that was thought to be very like the moon didn't last very long.

23:21.660 --> 23:25.720
No it didn't. The next mirror that went out there took another look and said,

23:25.820 --> 23:28.060
Found riverbeds, essentially.

23:28.060 --> 23:37.020
I still treasure the hope that when their landing is actually made that some little trace of life will be found.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.180
Somebody will come to greet them on throats.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.200
Someone will come to greet them on throats.

23:43.280 --> 23:43.560
Certainly.

23:43.960 --> 23:52.320
My hope for the Lee Brackett Mars or the Ray Bradbury Mars depends on remaking Mars, not on finding it that way.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.000
It's a fascinating idea.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.020
If the universe isn't the way you like it, there's always fantasy.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.340
Today's science fiction is tomorrow's history.

24:01.100 --> 24:01.380
Music

24:10.620 --> 24:19.360
Man. Earth. The universe. Tomorrow. What's in store?

24:25.320 --> 24:26.720
Music
