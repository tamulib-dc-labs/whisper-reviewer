00:01.440 --> 00:02.480
I'll just do that one half.

00:02.940 --> 00:03.780
I think I got rid of it.

00:05.100 --> 00:05.660
Is that better?

00:06.940 --> 00:07.740
Uh, nope.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.360
Alright, now let's see if it's gone.

00:10.980 --> 00:11.360
It's gone?

00:12.000 --> 00:12.880
Yeah, it's gone.

00:13.260 --> 00:14.460
Count to five for me please.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.020
Oh, one, two, three, four, five.

00:17.380 --> 00:18.160
Looks good.

00:19.520 --> 00:19.920
Alrighty.

00:20.280 --> 00:20.760
I get it right.

00:21.740 --> 00:22.580
Yeah, we got it.

00:22.800 --> 00:23.320
We got it.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.020
We got it.

00:24.580 --> 00:25.960
Test, test, test, test.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.400
Test, test, test, test.

00:28.980 --> 00:29.380
Alright.

00:33.020 --> 00:33.420
Alrighty.

00:35.780 --> 00:37.680
You say that would have been too cold out there, didn't you?

00:38.200 --> 00:38.520
What, here?

00:39.000 --> 00:39.260
Yeah.

00:39.460 --> 00:40.720
No, it's been very mild here.

00:41.820 --> 00:42.220
Okay.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.300
We, uh...

00:48.300 --> 00:50.400
When we first arrived, we, uh...

00:52.280 --> 00:54.400
We thought it was a little chilly, can't be...

00:56.840 --> 01:00.700
Until we heard that Orlando had minus 29 the previous night,

01:00.900 --> 01:02.680
and then we just feel it was a chilly.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.560
Okay, we've got the tape recorder rolling.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.760
Just one more time if you'd count to three for me please.

01:10.300 --> 01:13.260
Oh, how about one, two, three?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.100
One, two, three. Looks good.

01:20.120 --> 01:20.840
That's the other way.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.620
I can speak a little louder if this is faint.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.400
Now that's pretty good.

01:24.620 --> 01:29.540
Now we're far and beyond where we were as far as audio recording goes.

01:30.340 --> 01:35.760
Now we do all sorts of mixing and jump with this in the studio after we get through recording it.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.360
I have every confidence in America now.

01:40.300 --> 01:40.820
Good.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.400
Alright, we're gonna go ahead and get started.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.160
Okay.

01:56.860 --> 01:59.420
Alright. How did you get interested in writing?

02:01.740 --> 02:03.780
I was too long ago to remember.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.620
When I left school at, uh...

02:08.620 --> 02:11.060
When I was 16 and wanted to be a writer then,

02:11.980 --> 02:16.440
I guess it was, you know, something that I always enjoyed doing as a kid at school.

02:16.940 --> 02:20.540
You know, the essays and the story writing exercises you get.

02:22.220 --> 02:23.180
And, uh...

02:23.180 --> 02:26.080
When I left school I told the world I was gonna be a writer.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.060
And, you could think of a good idea until somebody said,

02:30.120 --> 02:36.600
well, with all the accumulated wisdom and experience of 16 years,

02:36.740 --> 02:40.020
what are you gonna write about that the world is breathlessly waiting to hear?

02:41.020 --> 02:44.300
And, uh, I hadn't thought about that and the answer was not a lot.

02:45.040 --> 02:50.960
So I went away into engineering and electronics and computers and things like that for something like 20 years.

02:52.600 --> 02:59.240
And I suppose the interest in writing probably never went away.

02:59.960 --> 03:05.300
And 20 odd years later, that situation had changed a lot.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.860
I'd spent a lot of that time.

03:06.980 --> 03:11.000
I started off as an electronics engineer and then a computer designer

03:11.000 --> 03:13.600
and then went into selling computer systems.

03:15.020 --> 03:22.820
And, uh, not the blue boxes you see at work that print out payrolls and things.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.680
I'm not talking about business computers,

03:24.940 --> 03:32.480
but the real-time scientific systems that might go into scientific research laboratories

03:32.480 --> 03:38.760
are connected up to instruments to collect all the data and turn them into pictures on screens.

03:38.760 --> 03:47.680
And, uh, the sort of computers you'd find in particle accelerator installations or observatories.

03:48.080 --> 03:55.540
In other words, all my customers were scientists, physicists, biologists, chemists and so forth.

03:56.240 --> 04:02.060
And the kind of system we're talking about ranged up to several million dollars.

04:02.340 --> 04:04.840
And when somebody's buying a system of that size,

04:04.840 --> 04:08.500
it's not the kind of thing that you sell in a one-half hour sales call.

04:09.740 --> 04:18.600
They sign the paper, you're frequently working with them for 12, maybe 18 months before a contract is finalized.

04:18.920 --> 04:24.040
And during that time, you have to, you know, try and understand a lot of what they're doing in,

04:24.160 --> 04:31.940
in terms of being able to put together and recommend the right sort of system for their needs.

04:31.940 --> 04:35.540
In other words, you get to know a little bit of what they're all doing.

04:36.440 --> 04:40.420
And I found it fascinating, a fascinating world that they lived in.

04:44.220 --> 04:49.380
You also get to know them socially, how they think, how they take, what makes them laugh.

04:49.980 --> 04:51.340
Very interesting as people.

04:52.180 --> 04:57.400
And I found 20 years later that there were a lot of interesting things that he was here to write about

04:57.400 --> 04:58.940
and form the basis of stories.

04:58.940 --> 05:04.180
So I didn't particularly set out to be a science fiction writer.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.780
I suppose I became one by accident.

05:06.640 --> 05:13.860
I just always wanted to write and started writing stories about the little bit of life that I'd had some personal experience of

05:14.940 --> 05:18.000
and was told I was a science fiction writer and I said, how's that?

05:18.340 --> 05:22.360
And they said, well, the publisher is publishing it under their science fiction influence.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.440
So we guess you have to be.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.220
So I said, OK.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.100
And it kind of started out like that.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.620
OK. Could you hold for just a second here?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.860
I've got to take care of a slide, flutter it in one of my machines.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.180
OK. Hang on. I'll be right back with you.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.100
Still here.

05:39.460 --> 05:39.940
Oh, OK.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.660
You've covered it along with the background already.

05:43.040 --> 05:43.760
Oh, is there a problem?

05:44.860 --> 05:47.340
I'm just getting a funny scraping noise off of real type.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.600
So it's not going to be really picking up anyway.

05:49.780 --> 05:50.460
So we'll just leave it.

05:50.720 --> 05:51.320
Has it gone away?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.540
No, it's sitting there just scraping away.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.000
But the heck with it.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.820
You've covered a lot of the background stuff, like I said.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.720
So I'll think I will go right into some other stuff.

06:07.260 --> 06:12.740
Associating with the scientists, as you were, I guess that gave you a lot of the background material that you use in your stories.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.920
Yeah. Well, that provided more to trigger.

06:16.480 --> 06:24.920
I, the stimulation to take an interest in that kind of work, I guess reading provided a lot of it.

06:26.100 --> 06:32.380
But that kind of material is easy to read when you have a vested interest in understanding it,

06:32.440 --> 06:39.300
because you have business relationships that will profit from that understanding.

06:39.560 --> 06:49.480
In other words, it's reading with a purpose, a clear-cut purpose rather than just out of curiosity or a way of killing time.

06:51.300 --> 06:54.520
So luckily it became a little more than that.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.540
Do you usually do a lot of...

06:58.540 --> 06:59.400
Back up here.

07:02.140 --> 07:05.560
Most of your stories, I guess, would be called hard science fiction.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.020
Yeah.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.960
Do you do a lot of research whenever you do write a story?

07:10.640 --> 07:11.260
Yeah, I do.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.340
I suppose a lot. I read quite a lot.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.480
And I suppose the bulk of my reading is nonfiction.

07:19.960 --> 07:27.760
So even casual reading in a way becomes what might be termed non-specific research.

07:27.940 --> 07:31.500
In other words, information that just gets stored away and comes out later,

07:31.500 --> 07:35.640
although I didn't study it for any particular reason at the time.

07:37.820 --> 07:43.940
But while I was... Before I became a full-time writer, I was still working in the computer business.

07:44.220 --> 07:50.860
I used to... I made use of my customers pretty freely as consultants, which was kind of handy.

07:51.100 --> 07:59.240
I found that I had customers who were brain surgeons and other customers who were studied pieces of rock brought back from the Apollo missions

07:59.240 --> 08:05.060
and other guys who were building in... or investigating machine intelligence.

08:05.060 --> 08:11.960
And just about any of the topics or the favorite themes of science fiction that you could take out of a hat,

08:13.460 --> 08:18.340
the chances were sort of not 10 to 1, I had a customer specializing in that field.

08:18.460 --> 08:22.900
And I just had to... If I needed some background information on a particular topic,

08:23.060 --> 08:28.220
I could almost guarantee I had a phone number in my diary as a guy who could talk all day about it.

08:29.340 --> 08:33.360
And they loved doing it as well. I used to call them and they'd say,

08:33.360 --> 08:38.480
I'd like to come and talk to you tomorrow. Well, we're a little busy, but what's it about?

08:38.680 --> 08:41.540
Oh, I need some help with the book I'm working on.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.120
Well, why didn't you say so? What times do you want to show up? And they talk all day.

08:46.120 --> 08:57.500
And I think this is one of the interesting sides of selling computers into this kind of area.

08:57.500 --> 09:04.740
You can imagine some of these specialists, they talk to bacteria all day long or whatever

09:04.740 --> 09:07.840
and they end up shutting the back rooms of universities.

09:08.620 --> 09:12.960
And maybe there are four people on the planet they can talk to who understand their language.

09:13.380 --> 09:21.620
And sometimes they find it hard to believe that somebody from the world outside

09:21.620 --> 09:27.640
that has walked in off the street is sincerely interested to sit down and talk to them

09:27.640 --> 09:32.100
and is curious and wants to know what they're doing, wants to have it explained.

09:33.500 --> 09:41.460
And it was a very pleasant way to work a living. You not only will gain customers,

09:41.600 --> 09:44.600
in many instances I found you gain friends as well.

09:46.720 --> 09:54.960
It's a very, very pleasant combination to build a life around where the things you like doing,

09:58.060 --> 10:03.020
the kind of work that you like to do, the kind of activity that you like to do

10:03.020 --> 10:08.680
is also part of a process of making friends and not only that somebody is prepared to pay you to do it.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.420
I found that a very pleasant situation.

10:12.700 --> 10:18.540
Your first novel, in fact I believe it was the first thing that you wrote, was Inherit of the Stars.

10:18.840 --> 10:19.240
Yes it was.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.360
It's a science fiction detective story.

10:23.860 --> 10:24.040
Yes.

10:24.660 --> 10:28.300
How did you come to write that book?

10:30.340 --> 10:32.600
Well, I think that sums it up pretty well.

10:32.600 --> 10:41.860
Well it reflects I think the way I see science, which is indeed as a wonderful,

10:42.300 --> 10:45.000
ongoing, never-ending detective story.

10:46.780 --> 10:55.300
And I suppose I got a little bit dissatisfied with some of the depictions of science and scientists

10:55.300 --> 10:56.600
that I'd seen in fiction.

10:58.720 --> 11:08.800
I formed the impression or the suspicion in some cases that perhaps the people who had written

11:08.800 --> 11:14.860
some of the fiction certainly would have perhaps not worked in a scientific field

11:15.140 --> 11:22.520
or spoken to a scientist for a long, long time and maybe generations of people had reinforced each other's cliches.

11:23.540 --> 11:29.400
Scientists were always eccentric and they wore odd colour shoes and they grew cabbages of eight people

11:29.400 --> 11:31.680
and they wanted to conquer the world or something.

11:32.740 --> 11:41.720
And there are these cute public impressions of scientists as people who run down the street with no clothes

11:41.720 --> 11:56.860
on shouting Eureka or have you read phrases like it came to him in a flash and you read on

11:56.860 --> 12:02.940
and what came to him in a flash would have been enough to keep Einstein busy for the next twenty years.

12:03.660 --> 12:16.680
And real science, there are insights, there are strokes of genius, but the overwhelming bulk of the work is done by a lot of unsung heroes,

12:16.900 --> 12:22.880
a lot of people doing nothing really dramatic or exciting but just meticulously sifting through details,

12:23.860 --> 12:30.080
collecting information for generations and for centuries, all different parts of the world.

12:30.080 --> 12:37.960
And it's really like putting together a huge chigsaw puzzle, lots of people cutting out pieces and twisting them round

12:37.960 --> 12:44.220
and every now and again somebody will take a huge chunk in this corner and see that it fits with a huge chunk down there

12:44.220 --> 12:46.600
and that's a breakthrough and so it goes on.

12:47.400 --> 12:52.820
And it really is a detective story, I think it's a far more exciting one than most detective fiction.

12:52.820 --> 13:02.180
And I wanted to write a story that attempted to depict it in this kind of way and hopefully would convey some of the excitement

13:02.180 --> 13:05.540
that personally I feel when I look at this whole thing.

13:06.460 --> 13:07.880
I believe the...

13:07.880 --> 13:18.140
I think that, I thought that yeah let's make it a detective story but if we want a detective mystery

13:18.140 --> 13:28.160
that is going to be sufficiently intriguing to motivate a large proportion of the scientific community as happened in Inherit the Stars,

13:28.880 --> 13:35.140
we want something a little more original and exciting than bodies in the library or footprints in the flower bed.

13:36.600 --> 13:41.180
So we invented Charlie and the aliens and the rest I suppose you know.

13:43.620 --> 13:50.040
Basically it was an attempt to depict science as it is or at least as I perceive it.

13:50.680 --> 13:58.060
And at the same time weave that into a story that people who were non-scientists, non-specialists would find stimulating and

14:00.480 --> 14:11.880
arousing for the curiosity even if without trying to turn it into a 250 page lab report or something like that.

14:12.380 --> 14:25.860
Yeah I believe, I don't know if I'm reading this into your work or not but some of what I'm feeling is that your writing is sort of almost a celebration of learning,

14:25.860 --> 14:27.660
you know the learning process.

14:28.020 --> 14:32.940
Yes, I think it's one of the most exciting processes anybody can experience.

14:33.960 --> 14:46.140
I think it's very sad that in large sections of our culture we should have evolved the attitude that learning is something you endure until you leave school

14:46.140 --> 14:50.500
and then it ceases with adulthood.

14:50.880 --> 14:59.240
I think education and living are just different aspects of the same process that never ends.

15:03.180 --> 15:07.160
In the minds of a lot of people the two teams seem to have separated out.

15:08.520 --> 15:18.300
And for some reason learning is looked upon as hard work and unpleasant and something that you still fear of unless you kind of avoid it.

15:18.420 --> 15:19.360
I think that's very, very sad.

15:20.960 --> 15:26.260
No reason why it should be so I think it's just a consequence of cultural expectations.

15:26.580 --> 15:31.700
A lot of people expect it to be hard work and tedious and sure enough it is.

15:33.420 --> 15:40.100
In your stories I've noticed that you really flesh out the futures that you create with a lot of detail.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.180
I lost my question.

15:48.460 --> 15:51.780
You were talking about the future.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.740
Let me just rephrase it here.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.580
I notice in your stories that you really flesh them out with a lot of detail.

16:00.220 --> 16:04.760
Does that simply just make the story more realistic?

16:07.500 --> 16:11.540
I don't know if there's any particular purpose in doing that.

16:11.780 --> 16:23.120
I try and use as much detail as I feel is needed to convey whatever meaning I'm trying to convey at that particular part of the book.

16:27.920 --> 16:32.800
Some parts I got over very quickly because there's really not a lot to say.

16:37.060 --> 16:42.460
I don't know if you have any specific examples in mind that we could talk about more particularly.

16:44.780 --> 16:52.080
I think the short answer is I simply make descriptions etc. as detailed as I feel they need to be

16:52.080 --> 16:53.360
to say what I want to say.

16:53.860 --> 17:00.080
I was remembering one particular instance when a hud is traveling from England to the United States

17:00.080 --> 17:07.520
and he opens up his briefcase and plugs in his video phone to the plane and makes this long distance call right there.

17:08.820 --> 17:20.420
It seems so natural that it just creates a very realistic atmosphere for your story.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.320
I like to do things like that.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.380
I see what you mean by detail now.

17:27.080 --> 17:36.120
I think these kinds of details do matter because if we're putting a story into a futuristic setting,

17:37.960 --> 17:45.280
I think the little details of background such as if the guy needs to make a phone call,

17:45.500 --> 17:48.000
how does he go about it if he needs to render CAD,

17:49.060 --> 17:53.120
these matter because if the story is being told in the future,

17:53.540 --> 17:57.420
the whole of the background has to be consistently futuristic.

17:59.760 --> 18:07.880
I've come across a number of instances which in my opinion are a little flawed because it's felt with an AW.

18:09.860 --> 18:19.620
A writer may have seized on a particular thought, maybe a new scientific idea or a machine or whatever,

18:20.180 --> 18:28.160
develops that very well but kind of gets hung up on it and in the background everything else that's going on hasn't changed into 1980.

18:32.040 --> 18:37.360
I think just stop typing for the five minutes it takes just to think about a situation.

18:37.640 --> 18:41.000
The guy is going to make a phone call just like stop and think how he might make that.

18:43.500 --> 18:55.180
Think about it for five minutes and then maybe show it in a way different to what would have been the impulsive thing to do in the first couple of seconds.

18:55.980 --> 19:03.480
It's worth the effort, I don't think it radically changes the story but it does give it that finishing polish as it were at least in that sense.

19:04.960 --> 19:09.060
I try to do this in all the stories and I find that readers like it.

19:13.440 --> 19:17.960
From the people who write to me and the people that I meet,

19:18.880 --> 19:33.000
one of the gratifying things I observe in the readership that I have is that it is not confined to what might be termed the hardcore science fiction reader

19:33.000 --> 19:36.660
who buys anything new that appears on the science fiction section of the bookstore.

19:38.700 --> 19:47.940
I suppose people who might be termed younger professional people in their late 20s, 30s, 40s in all manner of professions

19:47.940 --> 19:56.360
not necessarily to do with the scientists, teachers, lawyers, doctors, so forth, who typically would say,

19:56.640 --> 20:03.800
gee, I used to read science fiction when I was at college or when I was at university but I kind of grew out of it.

20:04.980 --> 20:10.480
I can't relate to the way out galaxies like years away anymore or aliens running around with ray guns.

20:11.100 --> 20:16.640
Today I have a family, a career, a mortgage, my feet are solidly on the surface of this planet.

20:17.420 --> 20:33.780
But they seem to like stories that don't kind of try and take them to the other side of the universe a million years from now

20:35.240 --> 20:37.540
and it kind of grabs them.

20:37.860 --> 20:43.020
I say, well, this I can relate to, it's the world that I live in just stretched a little bit.

20:43.220 --> 20:49.740
The connection is not broken, the economics and the politics have evolved and what I read in the papers, I can still see the connections.

20:50.460 --> 20:53.700
And it could be the world my kids know of it and I like it.

20:53.700 --> 21:04.200
And if it has that effect on that far vast market of readership then I'm perfectly happy to continue doing that

21:04.200 --> 21:09.360
in addition to the reason that I enjoy the stories better myself for doing that.

21:11.260 --> 21:15.700
I wouldn't be misreading and saying you're an optimistic person would I?

21:16.780 --> 21:17.720
I think I am.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.680
And notice your stories tend to be rather optimistic.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.840
Sure, why not?

21:26.980 --> 21:28.500
Good question, why not?

21:30.120 --> 21:32.100
I think there's enough doom and gloom around.

21:32.300 --> 21:35.220
I try and contribute something to counterbalance all that.

21:36.260 --> 21:37.360
I think it's needed.

21:40.280 --> 21:44.580
You probably would hold a great hope for the human potential then.

21:45.220 --> 21:48.440
Oh, excuse me, I missed the question.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.960
Okay, you probably would hold a great hope for the human potential.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.500
Oh, I think it's unlimited.

21:54.720 --> 22:02.560
It doesn't guarantee we'll use it correctly and wisely at all.

22:02.800 --> 22:09.900
There's no guarantee of that but I have no doubt that the potential exists and the choice is entirely up to us.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.080
And I think that in itself is grounds for optimism.

22:13.080 --> 22:23.960
It means that we're not pawns that are pushed around by fate or magical, mystical forces that we have no control over our future.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.020
I think that would be a very depressing thought.

22:27.420 --> 22:31.340
I think it underlies a lot of the philosophies that we hear astounded.

22:32.520 --> 22:40.020
Oh, excuse me to quit trying to write everything off as a futile.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.400
I don't subscribe to this at all.

22:42.560 --> 22:50.460
I think that in the same way that the individual future lies in his or her hands,

22:50.900 --> 22:53.680
and I think they have infinite potential to build upon,

22:53.980 --> 22:58.060
if they have the only resource that we're short of in some quarters,

22:58.220 --> 23:01.340
is positive thinking and the right attitude of mind.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.300
Nothing else.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.500
And I think collectively the same is true.

23:07.280 --> 23:15.720
I think that there is a human tendency to be too conscious of our failings and our faults and our mistakes,

23:17.080 --> 23:18.020
which have happened.

23:18.540 --> 23:20.040
It would be silly to deny that.

23:21.660 --> 23:26.780
But I think by and large we've achieved some remarkable and wonderful things as well,

23:26.940 --> 23:28.760
and continue to do so.

23:28.920 --> 23:32.640
And I think when I look at the bottom line of the balance sheet,

23:32.740 --> 23:34.820
I'm pretty proud to be a member of the human race.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.060
Okay, we're just commenting on here.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.600
I happen to agree with you.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.540
Could you hold for just a second here?

23:47.620 --> 23:48.560
We're going to shut the machine down.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.740
Zero just said go ahead and continue.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.420
He just stopped and I had just stopped the machine to find out what it was that he said.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.800
That was sort of redundant on my part.

23:59.180 --> 24:00.760
Okay, machines crank back up and.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Do this again?

24:03.500 --> 24:05.140
We're rolling again.

24:06.180 --> 24:06.740
Okay.

24:08.300 --> 24:17.220
In your novel, Christ Upon a Time, you base the story around a device that can send messages back in time to itself 24 hours in the past.

24:17.520 --> 24:17.700
Sure.

24:17.980 --> 24:21.700
And then by that process just keep sending it back to itself and back to itself.

24:21.980 --> 24:22.260
Uh huh.

24:23.140 --> 24:29.200
I've been reading recently about several scientists who are speculating about real possibilities of time travel.

24:29.480 --> 24:29.680
Yeah.

24:31.840 --> 24:37.020
Was your novel, uh, that your novel really was written before those came out.

24:37.180 --> 24:39.120
It's sort of prophetic in a way.

24:39.340 --> 24:40.480
Maybe that's where they got it from.

24:41.440 --> 24:45.900
Uh, well, I don't know whether it's prophetic or not.

24:46.060 --> 24:56.800
I said, well, as is elaborated in the book itself, if something like that ever became a fact, there are some pretty interesting problems that are going to have to be solved.

24:57.620 --> 25:04.880
And our ideas of logic and cause and effect are going to have to undergo some pretty interesting revisions.

25:05.380 --> 25:09.400
So I'm certainly not setting myself up as a prophet saying, yes, it'll happen.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.780
Um, maybe, I don't know.

25:11.840 --> 25:19.020
I think history has shown that, uh, impossible or it'll never happen are very dangerous phrases to use in any context.

25:19.520 --> 25:25.680
Uh, as far as I was concerned, it was just, uh, a fun basis for a story.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.520
Certainly not an original one.

25:28.080 --> 25:33.720
Although I did, I was trying, I don't suppose any of the things I've written about have been original in essence.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.820
I'd try and approach them from hopefully fresh and different angles.

25:39.640 --> 25:46.560
But for some time, for a number of years, in fact, before I wrote Thrice upon a time, I'd been wanting to write a time travel book for a number of reasons.

25:46.560 --> 26:04.220
Uh, firstly, I wanted to attempt to face up to the paradoxes, the logical paradoxes, once and for all, and answer them without top-outs, without convenient coincidences,

26:05.240 --> 26:12.320
and without obliging characters who just happen to do the right thing to make everything come out the way the author said.

26:15.000 --> 26:22.980
Uh, and secondly, I wanted to, I wanted to get away from this kind of cliche of some kind of a conjurer's box,

26:24.200 --> 26:29.700
described or described as whatever that you jump into and you jump out of and you're in some other time.

26:31.220 --> 26:38.180
Uh, we seem too many conjurer's boxes and it seemed to me unrealistic, if I ever build a box like that,

26:38.180 --> 26:43.320
and I thought it was going to take me to another time, I certainly would jump into it and press the button.

26:44.320 --> 26:49.500
I would conduct a long series of tests and experiments first and none of that here I've ever seen to do this.

26:50.360 --> 26:56.380
And it seemed to me reasonable to say if we're going to make the speculation of influencing the past,

26:58.960 --> 27:04.180
it seemed to me to be reasonable to speculate that if we're going to make that assumption anyway,

27:04.180 --> 27:15.700
that before we move structured objects and people back into another time, we probably learn how to inject energy first.

27:16.740 --> 27:24.600
And if you can send energy back in time, you can obviously switch the energy on and off and modulate it and send information.

27:25.220 --> 27:29.600
In other words, you can send messages to yourself if you like.

27:30.460 --> 27:40.460
I wanted to, I didn't want it to be a million years or a billion years or some huge amount of time where really nothing that you did could make any difference.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.800
How about a lab bench experiment, ten minutes?

27:43.740 --> 27:48.940
Now you can just send a little signal back to yourself ten minutes ago and change what you've already done.

27:49.220 --> 27:52.940
This is interesting, you're hard up against the paradoxes now.

27:52.940 --> 27:58.800
You can't duck around them or duck them. You've got to answer the question, what happens?

28:00.020 --> 28:07.620
The logic of the whole situation becomes absolutely, it drives you to the point of insanity trying to figure it out.

28:07.940 --> 28:16.000
I found the only way to do it was to think in terms of the simplest possible lab bench experiment that you could devise

28:16.000 --> 28:23.760
and strip away all the complications to just get the logic right and then elaborate it back in up to the level that would make a story interesting.

28:24.460 --> 28:30.400
And the simplest situation that you can think of is a button and a lamp, when you push the button the lamp comes on.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.860
Couldn't get much simpler than that.

28:33.680 --> 28:42.280
The only different thing here is the lamp comes on ten seconds before you press the button.

28:44.020 --> 28:46.180
Because the signal goes back in time.

28:46.560 --> 28:50.160
So the question is obvious, what happens? I wait until the lamp comes on.

28:50.960 --> 28:54.520
Ten seconds later it's time to press the button, I'm not going to press it.

28:54.840 --> 29:01.580
Nobody could make me. I didn't want mystical forces compelling people to do something they didn't want to do.

29:04.360 --> 29:08.740
I wanted to preserve human free will, so what happens? I don't press the button.

29:09.520 --> 29:18.840
Conversely I can say, well, the lamp didn't come on, but I'm going to press the button anyway, just for the hell of it. What happens?

29:19.960 --> 29:23.400
So those are two situations, one being the inverse of the other.

29:23.540 --> 29:31.720
And if you can explain what happens, you can answer any time travel paradox because every one is an elaboration of one of those situations or the other.

29:32.220 --> 29:37.980
And it's not good enough to, for example, to wait for the lamp to come on and you say,

29:38.100 --> 29:40.700
not going to press the button and fold your arms and sit there.

29:41.480 --> 29:47.240
And just as the time is up, the door opens and somebody stalls in and says, hey, what's this?

29:47.380 --> 29:47.980
And presses the button.

29:48.920 --> 29:55.720
That doesn't get you out of it because you're a scientist, you're going to repeat your experiment under conditions where that couldn't happen.

29:55.900 --> 29:58.320
You lock the door and set it up again.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.540
You go out of the room and have the computer press the button.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.300
But eventually you would test it time and time and time again.

30:04.480 --> 30:11.980
And if accidents happen that got you out of a mess the first time, you could eliminate them the next time.

30:12.460 --> 30:15.260
And eventually you have to face up to that question, what happens?

30:16.520 --> 30:17.480
That's what I wanted to do.

30:17.480 --> 30:35.580
And the third thing I wanted to do was to tell a story in which the time machine itself and the staggering conceptual changes in physics and philosophy that are implied are relevant to the story that's being told there,

30:36.520 --> 30:37.880
an integral part of it.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.860
If you talk them away there wouldn't be any story.

30:41.320 --> 30:46.240
I think in too many stories time machines are used like starships.

30:46.420 --> 30:59.260
They're just a device, a vehicle to get some characters into an unusual environment and then tell a pretty routine story that would stole them from Greek mythology or European medieval history.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.180
And the technology doesn't come into the story at all.

31:02.220 --> 31:03.620
They could have gone on a Greyhound bus.

31:04.760 --> 31:06.000
I didn't want to do that.

31:06.000 --> 31:28.240
And so the story was about some physicists who had stumbled upon this phenomenon and had realized that if what they were seeing meant what they thought it meant, it meant that they could actually inject information into the past and change the past with all the questions that implies.

31:30.320 --> 31:39.300
And being proceeded to test this phenomenon and obtain some very, very strange results.

31:40.120 --> 31:48.760
And yet they're convinced that behind all this there is some consistent system of super logic that does make sense and they're trying to figure out the rules of it.

31:51.380 --> 31:57.340
And of course there's an unspoken or unwritten invitation for the reader to participate.

31:57.700 --> 31:59.760
Again, I suppose it's a kind of a detective story.

32:00.700 --> 32:07.160
Not so much a who done it, but how is it done to see if the reader can figure out the rules before the characters did?

32:10.380 --> 32:17.080
Yeah, it is something that I noticed when I was reading the novel is that there are no unresolved paradoxes in it.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.660
You do sew them all up neatly before the end of the novel.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.200
Well, that was one of the goals of writing the book.

32:22.400 --> 32:22.440
Yeah.

32:23.040 --> 32:30.180
And I think it worked because the people that seem to know what they're talking about and have commented will seem pretty satisfied.

32:30.440 --> 32:31.700
So that made me pretty satisfied.

32:32.460 --> 32:42.300
There are a couple of silly things in there which don't really affect the physics of the time machine.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.940
There was a big fusion planned up in Scotland.

32:46.180 --> 32:51.920
And I don't know why due to a lapse of concentration on my part in one chapter it had moved to a rather pilot Scotland.

32:52.420 --> 32:54.500
We'll fix that when the book's next reprinted.

32:55.460 --> 32:58.320
There was an eagle-eyed Scotsman wrote to me and picked that out.

33:02.580 --> 33:07.260
It started off on the Solway Firth and ended up on the Murray Firth, or no the other way around.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.660
I got it on the wrong Firth in one chapter.

33:11.100 --> 33:15.060
Well, maybe for one of your future novels you'll have to explore matter transmitters.

33:15.640 --> 33:21.160
Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, that's another possibility.

33:21.300 --> 33:29.900
I did explore that in a short story I wrote called Assassin, which was in the Stella anthology series, Stella number four.

33:33.200 --> 33:37.200
This was exploring the possibility of matter transmission and of course people.

33:38.820 --> 33:44.500
You can instantly get somebody from here to there, but in fact what appears there is a copy of them.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.000
So you've now got two of them.

33:46.980 --> 33:52.440
If the other one decides to come back the same way you're getting rapidly multiplying problems, literally.

33:54.260 --> 33:56.820
Stella Assassin was a story that played around with that thought.

33:57.740 --> 33:58.980
I must have missed that one.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.000
Since Stella four, it came out a couple of years ago.

34:06.180 --> 34:09.980
You've written a sequel to the Inherit the Stars called The General Giants of Ganymede.

34:09.980 --> 34:10.340
That's right.

34:10.680 --> 34:16.380
Did you intend to follow the story in Inherit the Stars with a sequel or was it from Reader Demand or what?

34:17.240 --> 34:17.800
A bit of both.

34:18.760 --> 34:22.060
When I wrote Inherit the Stars I had three books in mind.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.100
I had a trilogy in mind.

34:25.200 --> 34:34.620
So I put the hooks in, although Inherit the Stars was a complete story in itself, it didn't leave the reader hanging.

34:34.860 --> 34:37.660
It started and told and finished a story.

34:38.220 --> 34:46.720
Nevertheless there were a couple of hooks in there that invited some questions, which were paved the way to a follow up book.

34:49.680 --> 35:03.220
My thinking at the time was I'll go that far, but I won't write the second book until I have some feedback as to how the readers liked the first one.

35:04.300 --> 35:09.000
I got a lot of mail and they all liked it and a lot of them said in their letters, will there be a follow up?

35:09.180 --> 35:10.160
They picked out the hooks.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.560
So I wrote The General Giants.

35:14.400 --> 35:19.920
And they wanted another one and I did have a trilogy in mind when I wrote it.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.240
And the third one in that series is now written.

35:22.520 --> 35:30.080
It's called Giants Star and it will be, it's a July title, so it should start to appear in the bookstores around June.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.500
The third and last, it won't be any more in that series.

35:35.620 --> 35:53.080
So it ties up a few of the loose ends, tells another story, continues with the characters we met in the previous two books, both the Terrestrial and the Aeod characters, and introduces some new ones.

35:54.260 --> 35:59.340
And I don't think there can be a fourth one because it really, I don't think there's any more to be said, it wraps it all up.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.180
Alright, are you working on any new projects?

36:05.760 --> 36:09.620
I'm working on the, as I say, Giants Star will be out in June, July.

36:10.420 --> 36:18.120
And I'm currently working on the one after that, which I don't have a title for yet because I always think of the title Blast.

36:19.720 --> 36:23.280
And I don't know when it'll be on sale because I don't know when I'll finish it.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.220
Probably sometime this spring.

36:27.140 --> 36:30.720
What type of story is it without giving away any of the plot detail?

36:31.100 --> 36:33.460
Well, it's, how can we sum it up?

36:39.640 --> 36:50.440
It's, it's, it's, it's promises, well, the background to the story is that we're in the second half of the next century.

36:51.720 --> 37:02.860
And some decades previously, in other words, in about, about around the year 2020, a robot star probe was sent out.

37:08.080 --> 37:14.540
Programmed to tour a number of stars and simply to search for habitable planets and generally explore.

37:15.180 --> 37:20.720
Send down surface probes, atmospheric probes, things like that, radio everything back.

37:23.740 --> 37:31.020
And the political situation on Earth was looking very, very grave at that time.

37:31.260 --> 37:36.120
I am an optimist, but I can still invent all three scenarios for a story, though it's fiction after all.

37:37.300 --> 37:40.620
Optimism may turn out to be unjustified yet, but, uh,

37:46.700 --> 37:53.780
towards the closing years of this project, in other words, obviously you don't build a ship like that overnight.

37:54.640 --> 38:05.340
And when it was well along the way towards being completed, it was modified to be capable of making people.

38:06.700 --> 38:09.020
Let me quantify that, that's a strange thing to say.

38:09.680 --> 38:14.300
We'll read a lot of stories about starships that go on long voyages that take maybe centuries,

38:14.540 --> 38:19.500
and inevitably they've got frozen bodies or bodies in suspended animation or something like that.

38:21.620 --> 38:29.240
But when you think about it, it seems rather an inefficient way to say, you know, they're not doing anything, the machines can fly the ship, the computers can get it there.

38:29.960 --> 38:34.820
The people aren't doing anything about it except, you know, just lying there freezing.

38:34.820 --> 38:40.940
So, uh, why not let the machines fly the ship and make the people when you get there?

38:41.680 --> 38:48.480
If we look at the progress made in molecular biology and genetic engineering in the last couple of decades,

38:49.320 --> 38:56.300
we already manufactured quite complex organic molecules to specifications such as drugs and certain anesthetics.

38:57.140 --> 39:02.060
If we just extrapolate that a little further, who's to say you couldn't make a complete set of human DNA?

39:02.800 --> 39:08.980
In other words, instead of sending bodies and all the support equipment to freeze them and taking up all the space,

39:09.180 --> 39:20.560
why not just store all the genetic information necessary to make people electronically in the computers

39:21.500 --> 39:28.160
and create them when you have found a planet that the instruments say they could survive on?

39:29.840 --> 39:35.260
And, you know, let's imagine for a sake of argument that ten light years away you found a planet.

39:35.460 --> 39:43.560
Well, if the robot ship got there and sent back a signal saying, started the experiment, well, ten years later the signal gets to Earth.

39:45.260 --> 39:51.720
And even if they responded instantly, the ship's been in orbit for twenty years doing nothing, just waiting for a reply.

39:51.720 --> 39:58.100
Well, the ultimate test of whether or not a planet is inevitable is to set up a colony and try it.

39:58.940 --> 40:01.220
So we could have used those twenty years.

40:02.420 --> 40:17.920
So here is the interesting possibility of a race that evolves from a first generation of embryos that were created and nurtured and raised by computers and robots.

40:18.600 --> 40:19.780
A machine-raised race.

40:20.700 --> 40:29.400
And when you think about it, the relationship between the children and the machines does not really have to be a cold and sinister one at all.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.560
It could be quite a charming and amusing one.

40:35.580 --> 40:49.760
And the interesting thoughts that the book starts to play with is, here is a race of kids that are being raised by some very rational, direct, down-to-earth end-to-earth.

40:51.100 --> 40:57.560
Who don't double talk or deceive or have all these layers of human game-playing that we have to contend with.

40:58.920 --> 41:14.180
And they're being raised completely without any exposure to the conditioning of conditioned adults with their prejudices and hatred and taboos.

41:14.180 --> 41:19.220
And a lot of the other non-stances that make life so complicated in our society.

41:21.620 --> 41:24.360
And also, I mean, they're not a primitive society.

41:24.480 --> 41:31.660
They're a very high-technology society that they arrive with some of the most advanced equipment and technology ever devised.

41:32.610 --> 41:32.960
Right?

41:33.260 --> 41:33.320
Yeah.

41:36.350 --> 41:46.880
While they were in orbit and growing up through infancy, the machines were down on the surface, preparing surface bases, manufacturing facilities and industries and so forth.

41:46.880 --> 42:04.740
So, by the time they actually enter adolescence, the races, the generations I should say that follow thereafter, all of their material needs are provided by highly automated means.

42:04.880 --> 42:11.420
In terms of their productivity relative to their numbers, everyone is a millionaire.

42:13.940 --> 42:17.900
And let's imagine that a mission from Earth eventually shows up.

42:20.980 --> 42:25.140
Virtually, you know, a big mission. This is usually a 20-year voyage, maybe.

42:26.140 --> 42:32.300
So we're talking about a spaceship that maybe houses 20,000 people, virtually a space colony with engines.

42:32.980 --> 42:38.500
With its government, its military, its church organizations, its commercial institutions.

42:38.500 --> 42:47.420
The whole of society in miniature with its time-proved mechanisms for controlling and subordinating a population.

42:48.220 --> 43:03.080
Which traditionally, a ruling elite through history has imposed itself by restricting the flow of wealth and by offering protection either from real or imagined threats.

43:03.680 --> 43:14.700
But how do you control a race of millionaires who don't need your wealth and the idea of restricting anything has never occurred to them?

43:16.540 --> 43:20.300
They're restricting the supply of anything. They don't need you to protect them from anybody.

43:21.140 --> 43:25.340
And none of the tricks or the psychology or the scare tactics work.

43:26.740 --> 43:33.460
So what happens when a race of machine-raised people eventually collides with a race of people-raised people?

43:34.380 --> 43:36.040
And that's really what the story is all about.

43:38.060 --> 43:41.700
Alright, let's hold for just a second. Crank the machine back up here.

43:43.940 --> 43:44.420
Okay.

43:47.080 --> 43:48.680
Shut the machine back up.

43:49.120 --> 43:53.820
Okay, I'll go ahead and ask the question and then we'll just splice this into this show when we do it.

43:53.820 --> 43:54.220
Okay.

43:55.860 --> 44:00.120
In your novel, Two Faces of Tomorrow, you explore the future of machine intelligence.

44:00.440 --> 44:00.600
Okay.

44:00.880 --> 44:04.420
How far away do you think we might be from intelligent computers?

44:08.940 --> 44:11.620
I don't know that I have an answer to that.

44:14.780 --> 44:19.860
Two Faces was not intended to be prophetic in any way.

44:19.860 --> 44:29.480
Nothing that I write in the fictional sense is I simply sketch possibilities of what might be, not predictions of what will be.

44:31.320 --> 44:36.260
Putting a time limit on it, it's an awkward thing to be asked to do.

44:39.280 --> 44:42.840
I'm sort of thinking about this.

44:42.960 --> 44:56.300
My mind is going back over the number of confident predictions that have been made in the past on various topics that proved disasterously wrong either one way or the other.

45:00.400 --> 45:11.820
I see no reason in principle why artificial systems of some kind, not necessarily what we'd call computers.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.900
In other words, electronics of some form inside a box of some form.

45:16.900 --> 45:34.580
But simply man-made system should not in principle be capable of all of the feats that are performed by the human mind.

45:34.580 --> 45:46.120
In other words, thinking in the sense that we normally use the word and all its connotations in everyday conversations.

45:50.820 --> 45:59.620
We have a system already in existence, a physical system that can think the human brain itself.

46:01.820 --> 46:15.620
We could turn the question around a little and say, if the human brain is a physical system that can think, is there any reason to suppose that some other...
