WEBVTT

00:01.220 --> 00:01.620
Okay.

00:02.140 --> 00:05.940
Because we did get, I remember at the end of the last interview, you told us in pretty

00:05.940 --> 00:09.220
much detail what the voyage from yesterday was about and so forth.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.120
Did I?

00:10.360 --> 00:11.360
Yeah, we have material on that.

00:11.460 --> 00:12.660
I think you were just finishing it up.

00:12.980 --> 00:13.260
Okay.

00:14.260 --> 00:19.060
First of all, I noticed in Locust that you received the Prometheus Award for the voyage

00:19.060 --> 00:19.460
from yesterday.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.420
And I wondered what that award was.

00:21.960 --> 00:22.180
Anything?

00:22.800 --> 00:25.480
I wondered what that award consisted of, what it was given for.

00:25.480 --> 00:41.640
It's given by the Libertarian Party every year for the fictional novel which they believe

00:42.040 --> 00:49.160
best depicts the ideals and values that their party stands for.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
That's about all I know.

00:51.160 --> 01:01.140
I think they're pretty much, they're strongly for individual freedom and the individual responsibility

01:01.140 --> 01:08.400
that goes with it and the minimum government intervention in business and in the life of

01:08.400 --> 01:18.640
the private individual that's consistent with a secure and sanely functioning society.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.220
In other words, the award is not just for a science fiction novel, yours just happened

01:23.220 --> 01:23.720
to be one.

01:24.420 --> 01:25.160
I believe so.

01:26.760 --> 01:27.520
Yeah, okay.

01:28.180 --> 01:31.060
Okay, is this word pronounced Chironians or Chironians?

01:34.260 --> 01:38.780
I pronounce it Chironians, but I couldn't really say Chironians is wrong.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.460
Different people have different customs.

01:44.460 --> 01:49.240
Sometimes I remember when we did Latin at school the pronunciation of certain Latin

01:49.240 --> 01:51.860
verbs depended on which school you went to.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.300
I think it's pretty much the same with this.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.840
I pronounce it Chironians.

01:55.980 --> 02:02.700
Okay, my question would be to the Chironians, they desired physical contact with Earthmen,

02:02.800 --> 02:05.400
I guess seemingly to connect with their roots.

02:06.340 --> 02:10.860
And I wondered, do you think it's possible therefore to construct a machine race society

02:10.860 --> 02:13.120
off Earth while our genes allow it?

02:14.880 --> 02:16.440
I don't see why not.

02:18.820 --> 02:24.980
The fact that I had them behaving that way, it's not necessarily a prophecy or a prediction

02:24.980 --> 02:27.060
or a statement of anything that's inevitable.

02:27.260 --> 02:36.280
It was just a trait that made them more interesting as thinking, feeling beings and gave an underlying

02:36.280 --> 02:38.080
motivation for a lot of their actions.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.160
So it was purely arbitrary to help to tie the plot together.

02:42.380 --> 02:45.640
It wasn't a prediction based on anything I know that's true of us.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.300
Okay, this is a picky question.

02:49.420 --> 02:54.300
I'm not even sure this would go in the final interview, but I was concerned in the...

02:55.080 --> 03:00.520
It was fairly early in the book when the two, the Chironians and the Earthmen, they're

03:00.520 --> 03:01.680
blending, they're getting together.

03:02.340 --> 03:05.040
And there was a bar scene where the killing occurred.

03:05.240 --> 03:05.560
Okay.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.600
Okay, and the Chironian woman was being molested.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.440
She pulled out a pistol and shot the guy in the leg.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.680
Then there was an altercation and one of the Earthmen was killed.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.760
It seemed a little strange to me, given their society, that they were carrying guns.

03:22.060 --> 03:22.460
Right.

03:23.660 --> 03:26.440
Well, I realized they have that huge weapon and they're pretty...

03:26.440 --> 03:28.500
They're well able to take care of themselves.

03:28.740 --> 03:31.800
But I wouldn't have thought that they would need those guns against each other.

03:31.980 --> 03:34.340
Were they carrying them just specifically because Earthmen were around?

03:35.700 --> 03:40.800
I think that was explained, is that it was a habit that went back several generations,

03:41.100 --> 03:42.900
but they carried them against each other.

03:43.580 --> 03:47.220
There were some talks in another part of the book.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.740
You see, there's never any...

03:53.680 --> 03:55.740
They're personalities, they're individuals.

03:55.740 --> 04:04.800
They are the result of the same dealing out and mixing of human gene sets as the rest of us.

04:05.420 --> 04:08.040
They're not in any way a super race.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.360
They don't all have an IQ.

04:09.720 --> 04:14.980
They aren't all ethically and morally superior and rational in their behavior.

04:15.140 --> 04:20.380
In other words, I wasn't really trying to depict the utopia.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.740
I don't really like stories about utopia.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.100
I think they're hideously boring places to read about.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.540
And, yeah, because of the accident...

04:28.540 --> 04:34.780
Well, not really the accident, because of the circumstances surrounding their origins

04:35.960 --> 04:44.820
and the isolation of their society from the way many of the problems of our society are passed on through the ages,

04:44.820 --> 04:52.240
it so happened that many of the things that we would regard as problems had been solved,

04:53.060 --> 04:58.440
or at least cease to be problems, but I wasn't trying to suggest it was some utopia,

04:59.100 --> 05:04.440
and everybody always acted rational and everybody always acted compassionately and sympathetically

05:04.440 --> 05:06.340
and did the good thing.

05:06.980 --> 05:08.940
I think that's kind of a cop-out, right?

05:09.720 --> 05:12.100
Sometimes trying to depict these advanced societies,

05:12.100 --> 05:16.600
and you say, well, how do you solve the problem about the drunk next to you in the bar

05:16.600 --> 05:20.440
who insists on starting a fight or somebody who tries to...

05:20.440 --> 05:24.040
People who insist on being obnoxious and bothering other people,

05:24.140 --> 05:27.880
and they get around having to solve the problem by never having people act that way.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.740
Well, that's unrealistic. People are going to act that way.

05:31.320 --> 05:37.120
And in their society, they just defended themselves against such eventualities

05:37.120 --> 05:40.920
because there was no tradition or authority to tell them they shouldn't.

05:42.260 --> 05:47.600
And I guess by the time the Earth people showed up, it was never a custom

05:47.600 --> 05:51.400
that it's like wearing a hat or a pair of boots that have been handed down.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.400
Although I think your point is probably a very good one.

05:55.540 --> 05:59.320
It could be that with the Earth people around in their ways,

06:00.080 --> 06:03.760
quite a number of people who left their gutter home for the last few years

06:03.760 --> 06:08.000
and just used it as a sous-videy, it might take it out of where it can carry it around,

06:08.080 --> 06:10.460
again, just in case. I think that's very likely.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.520
Well, I would specifically say so in the book.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.040
Okay, that's good. Okay, let me skip to the Code of the Lifemaker.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.800
Of course, there you return or you continue with one of the themes that I think you pursue

06:22.800 --> 06:26.320
in much of your fiction, intelligent machines or so forth.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.860
I guess now this is almost a rhetorical question, so I think I know the answer to it.

06:30.860 --> 06:35.120
But one of your contentions in the novel is that machines or manufactured artifacts

06:35.120 --> 06:37.860
can have life which is just as valid as human life, right?

06:41.400 --> 06:46.680
Okay, now we normally think of machines as free from human prejudices

06:46.680 --> 06:48.560
and emotional weaknesses and so forth.

06:49.400 --> 06:54.440
It should give the Taloids normal human shortcomings in religion and mysticism and so forth.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.440
And I wondered why you did that.

06:58.500 --> 07:11.360
I don't think the fact that those traits exist in us, I would suggest isn't a consequence

07:11.360 --> 07:17.440
of our intelligence being supported by carbon chemistry hardware.

07:17.980 --> 07:23.760
It's a consequence of our intelligence and our human characteristics,

07:23.760 --> 07:30.760
including our aggressiveness, our jealousies and a lot of the things that can cause problems

07:31.280 --> 07:37.820
in the relatively secure environment of a civilized culture having originated

07:37.820 --> 07:44.480
in a competitive, survival-based evolutionary environment.

07:44.480 --> 07:54.800
It was the way in which we were, the way in which we evolved as beings that determined those traits.

07:55.200 --> 08:02.340
It had nothing to do with the hardware that our mental processes happened to be supported by.

08:03.520 --> 08:10.860
In the case of the Taloids, they, because of the beginnings that they come from,

08:10.860 --> 08:17.780
which we described in the prologue, they had evolved competitively in a survival-oriented fashion

08:17.780 --> 08:20.000
in exactly the same way as we had.

08:20.740 --> 08:28.680
I think my suggestion, I think it's quite a fairly valid one, is that they would have evolved similar traits

08:28.680 --> 08:35.440
and strengths and weaknesses, beliefs, systems, exactly the way we did

08:35.440 --> 08:38.500
because they had evolved them to serve exactly the same purposes.

08:38.500 --> 08:44.040
The fact that their faculties were supported on electronic hardware and ours

08:44.040 --> 08:48.940
is supported on carbon chemistry hardware, to my mind, is completely immaterial.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.100
In other words, I guess that actually giving in those kinds of human traits

08:54.100 --> 08:58.160
is sort of reinforcing the notion that there's no, doesn't have to be any essential difference

08:58.160 --> 09:00.060
between carbon-based and machine life.

09:00.400 --> 09:00.740
Exactly.

09:00.740 --> 09:09.860
I mean, the fact that we call thinking is a very complex function of the nervous system

09:09.860 --> 09:15.600
that's evolved over millions of years, but I suggest it's an emergent property

09:15.600 --> 09:20.860
of the level of complexity and the way in which that complexity is organized

09:20.860 --> 09:22.720
at the highest level of the human brain.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.900
It's nothing to do with the fact that down at the bottom level of the hardware

09:27.900 --> 09:32.680
we happen to be talking about mechanical neurons instead of mechanical electronic chips.

09:37.280 --> 09:44.800
You point to that, it doesn't make a lot of difference, which any, to try and demystify the whole topic

09:44.800 --> 09:54.900
I would reverse the normal way the question's asked and say, if, as is demands to be obvious,

09:54.900 --> 10:03.100
if a system exists that's capable of supporting all of the operations we normally refer to

10:03.100 --> 10:12.660
in everyday speech when we use the word thinking, and that system happens to have come from naturally evolved origins,

10:13.420 --> 10:20.840
is there any reason to suppose that a system of comparable complexity and organization

10:20.840 --> 10:27.580
that happens to have come from some other origins shouldn't be capable of doing right wise?

10:27.920 --> 10:30.460
My answer is there's no reason to suppose that that's true.

10:33.040 --> 10:38.860
Another part of it, of course, was it was kind of a little writer's license in that here we have these machines

10:38.860 --> 10:47.000
and their culture, and obviously they were very human-like in some of their emotions

10:47.000 --> 10:52.860
and some of the ways they did evolve, that's quite deliberate of course to enable the reader to relate more closely to them.

10:53.120 --> 11:00.720
If we made them totally alien and maybe building totally different representations of world models and self-images

11:01.600 --> 11:04.700
it could be very clever, but you'd lose most readers completely.

11:04.900 --> 11:09.100
They'd just say, well, it was describing some aliens out of concepts, I couldn't understand it.

11:10.020 --> 11:14.560
So I kind of deliberately bet that way a little because it is fiction after all,

11:14.560 --> 11:17.760
and the object is to entertain human beings whether or not it's about machines.

11:19.780 --> 11:27.820
Okay, one of the things I appreciated about the novel, I enjoyed it and I agree with it, was to me it had a pretty sharp satiric edge to it.

11:28.540 --> 11:34.200
As a small example of little touches, one of the Taloids, I think his name was Gruirk,

11:35.300 --> 11:39.160
he enters a city on a steendonk, he's preaching words of faith from the life-maker.

11:39.160 --> 11:44.240
I wondered if you were just having fun with something like that or are you seriously tearing something down?

11:44.700 --> 11:46.060
Oh, obviously, I'm in fun.

11:48.460 --> 11:48.700
Okay.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.340
Now some of these are rhetorical, I think I know the answers, but why Zambendorf is one of the protagonists?

11:59.400 --> 12:04.820
He's a con man who operates with alleged mystical powers and so forth, something that you must personally detest.

12:05.200 --> 12:05.480
Correct.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.380
So I've got the question.

12:08.940 --> 12:13.480
Well, why do you make him one of the protagonists? That we see much of what's happening through his eyes?

12:13.820 --> 12:14.360
I didn't.

12:16.080 --> 12:27.020
When I started to write this book, the original protagonist was Jerry Massey, the psychologist, and the conjurer.

12:28.280 --> 12:28.520
Okay?

12:29.100 --> 12:29.260
Right.

12:30.900 --> 12:38.460
And Jerry Massey was originally supposed to be the protagonist, and I had 20 pages of, excuse me, 20 chapters of the book written,

12:38.600 --> 12:41.540
and it wasn't working, so I tore them all up and started all over again.

12:42.260 --> 12:47.640
The reason it wasn't working, what happens when you start to write a novel?

12:47.780 --> 12:54.960
One of the signs that it's going right, sometimes I go to science fiction conventions, I sit on panels,

12:54.960 --> 13:03.000
and the panels are very frequently on scientific subjects and the kinds of things that are speculated about in science fiction.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.780
But also, I just tried to swat a fly that's bothering me.

13:12.820 --> 13:17.800
Some of them are on writing itself, being a writer and how to sell you stuff and things like that.

13:17.800 --> 13:29.000
I left comfortable on those panels because I'm not sure of the value of all this advice that professionals throw out and would be writers,

13:29.180 --> 13:32.660
you know, reverently absorbed and no doubt. I think a lot of it is luck.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.940
But so many of these things are just gut-feel.

13:40.300 --> 13:46.640
One of the arts of writing a book, I guess, is knowing where to draw the line of, where do you stop fiddling around with it?

13:46.640 --> 13:48.500
And mail it off to the editor.

13:50.100 --> 13:56.400
Nothing in nature is linear and one of the most universal nonlinear functions is the law of diminishing returns.

13:57.500 --> 14:05.340
And as you put more and more effort into a book, the extra improvement that you buy for your time gets less and less.

14:06.480 --> 14:11.600
And you can fiddle around trying to get something perfect and start to death in the meantime.

14:12.160 --> 14:22.600
At the other end, you can take far too little care and mail off a half-baked set of ideas that don't stand a hope in hell of getting sold by,

14:22.740 --> 14:24.340
at least not to any decent publisher.

14:25.060 --> 14:28.700
And somewhere between the two, there's this optimum level and all I can say is gut-feel.

14:28.780 --> 14:34.580
I don't know of any list of conditions you can check off and say, you know, check the boxes and then it's ready to send.

14:36.080 --> 14:43.820
And when it comes to characters, one of the things that the gut feels that you get when you know the book is going right,

14:44.140 --> 14:50.860
is when the characters kind of come to life in your mind and start to take over the story and they start to do things their way.

14:51.560 --> 14:59.260
And it means that they are acquiring real personalities themselves and they're doing the things you know they would do.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.780
And you say, how do you know so-and-so would do that?

15:01.780 --> 15:09.280
Well, I just know him and it's like the person you sat next to in the office for the last three years, somebody cracks a joke and you say,

15:09.320 --> 15:12.780
hey, Harry would love that. You know Harry, you know the way you think.

15:13.760 --> 15:21.860
And it got to about 20 chapters and it just, you know, the characters were just nasty, were just not working.

15:22.300 --> 15:29.240
He was not doing anything. He was wandering around as a passive observer and listener.

15:29.240 --> 15:33.500
He was watching what other people were doing and listening to what other people were saying.

15:33.940 --> 15:40.600
So he was just a roving observer acting on behalf of the reader.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.140
And it's just not terrifying. It didn't feel right.

15:45.200 --> 15:54.660
And one of the, when you decided on a setting for a story to write about, how do you decide who's going to be the protagonist anyway?

15:57.220 --> 16:10.420
One good principle to follow is that to ask who is most affected by the outcome of the story or who most drives the story,

16:10.560 --> 16:14.260
whose actions are most responsible for the story coming out the way it is.

16:14.900 --> 16:20.760
And if somebody clearly stands out in that role, that's a good candidate for the protagonist.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.620
And after 20 chapters it was pretty obvious it wasn't nasty.

16:24.580 --> 16:27.180
And yet it just seemed to be Xamadoff.

16:27.860 --> 16:39.220
And I suppose interesting stories to write about are periods in an individual's life where the person is changed,

16:40.040 --> 16:43.000
their outlook on life is changed, their values have changed.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.940
They come out of the story visibly different in ways from when they went in.

16:47.940 --> 16:51.680
Well, that's probably an interesting period in their life to write about.

16:52.100 --> 16:59.380
And they're the obvious protagonist for that particular story, and that's the way it worked out in this case.

17:00.060 --> 17:07.140
And whether I happen to have a lot of time for ESP and so-called paranormal phenomena is beside the point.

17:08.420 --> 17:16.800
And in any case, why should that disqualify the character from being my protagonist if I happen not to agree with him?

17:16.800 --> 17:22.720
I mean plenty of people like, oh Frederick Forsythe in the day of the Jackal, and a lot of books we could name it,

17:23.840 --> 17:27.620
they're here as a protagonist, as maybe a murderer or an assassin.

17:28.480 --> 17:36.080
That certainly doesn't mean that the author of the book is advocating murder or assassination as a pastime.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.860
Okay, good. I've only got one more major question.

17:40.860 --> 17:47.020
And that would involve, oh let's say, works in progress, books coming out in the near future.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.980
Could you give me a little statement on that?

17:49.360 --> 17:56.860
Yeah, about halfway through the next book, it's different from the others, but they're all different from each other.

17:56.980 --> 18:02.520
I don't think any of them have variations on the same theme.

18:02.680 --> 18:06.620
We've had one on intelligence computers and one on time travel.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.900
One on aliens and so forth.

18:10.920 --> 18:18.240
This one is, we haven't had an alternate universe story yet, so that's what this one is.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.820
And it gets mixed up with World War II.

18:21.840 --> 18:26.020
Most of it takes place between the beginning of 1939 and the end of 1942.

18:26.980 --> 18:35.540
And the characters include Franklin Roosevelt, Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, and a whole list of names like that.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.940
Oh, is it the kind of thing we ought to talk too much about in advance?

18:43.720 --> 18:44.640
Probably not, I guess.

18:44.640 --> 18:54.600
Let's just say that the official version has it that the Manhattan Project dealt with developing the Fish and Bomb,

18:56.200 --> 19:02.040
and Einstein's latter years were spent wrestling with an unsolved problem in unified field theory.

19:02.420 --> 19:07.320
Well, both those stories are true as far as they went, as far as they go.

19:08.380 --> 19:12.040
However, there was a little more to it than that, which is what this book goes into.

19:13.660 --> 19:15.860
Okay, good. I don't suppose it has any title yet then?

19:16.220 --> 19:22.520
No, it doesn't. No, the title is always the last thing I put on the book.

19:22.640 --> 19:30.580
I just have a working label in the meantime that I simply use to refer to the book, and at the moment it's just a computer file name.

19:32.920 --> 19:33.320
Okay.

19:35.060 --> 19:40.720
Yeah, we had a very good interview with you before, so really as short as this is, that will be sufficient.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.880
Is there anything else you'd like to add or bring up or have put in the book or anything like that?

19:47.220 --> 19:52.360
Nothing that comes readily to mind, but if you find you have further questions, feel free to give me a call.

19:53.480 --> 19:59.940
Okay, that's good. Listen, we are regular attendees at the AggieCon, which we understand you're going to be at next year.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.100
Yep, that's what they tell me.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.440
So we will be there to meet you finally.

20:03.780 --> 20:04.480
I look forward to that.

20:06.020 --> 20:11.160
We'll send you a copy of this book when it's published. It's going to be probably at least a year.

20:11.620 --> 20:14.760
Okay, well, I don't expect that these things don't happen overnight.

20:15.080 --> 20:21.380
Yeah, and later on when we get the manuscript transcribed, of course we're having typists transcribe the interviews,

20:22.220 --> 20:27.840
and when we do everything ready, introductions written and so forth, we'll maybe get back in touch with you and see if you have an extra picture.

20:28.220 --> 20:29.380
You did already send it, didn't you?

20:29.440 --> 20:30.240
I haven't sent it yet.

20:30.240 --> 20:30.920
Oh, that's right. Okay.

20:31.700 --> 20:32.320
Yeah, so when we...

20:32.320 --> 20:34.420
We'll be in town for the last two weeks, I've only just got back.

20:34.720 --> 20:39.040
Yeah, in the future when we need it, we'll go ahead and send you a stamped envelope or something,

20:39.140 --> 20:42.300
and if you wouldn't bother, it wouldn't be a bother, you can send us one.

20:42.420 --> 20:42.780
I appreciate that.

20:43.140 --> 20:45.200
I'll get a photograph off to you today or tomorrow.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.000
Okay, then thank you, Mr. Rogen. We sure appreciate your time.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.500
Okay, I appreciate your interest.

20:49.660 --> 20:50.260
Okay, take care.

20:50.480 --> 20:50.820
Thank you.

20:50.900 --> 20:51.020
Bye.

20:51.140 --> 20:51.580
Bye now.
