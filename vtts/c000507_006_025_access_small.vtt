Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.880 --> 00:34.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.700
And here are your hosts.

00:43.220 --> 00:45.400
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.900
For 20 years, Roger Zalazni has been writing science fiction and fantasy.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.060
He tells us why and how he became a science fiction writer.

00:53.040 --> 00:53.960
Well, it's a funny thing.

00:53.960 --> 01:03.840
I was originally a reader of science fiction from about the age of 11 through high school.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.240
During that period, I did write a lot of science fiction stories, which I tried to sell, but

01:08.240 --> 01:09.820
I was like my early teens.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.260
I didn't really meet any success at that point.

01:17.020 --> 01:21.800
I decided actually before that that I wanted to be a writer.

01:22.660 --> 01:28.740
It wasn't necessarily science fiction that I had in mind, though, but it was science fiction

01:28.740 --> 01:31.500
stories that I was writing during the period I was reading them.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.100
When I went to college, I stopped reading science fiction, just concentrated on the material

01:36.100 --> 01:39.080
I had there, and I wrote poetry actually, exclusively.

01:40.380 --> 01:45.060
I decided that I was going to start writing again as soon as I got out of college and

01:45.060 --> 01:45.800
had some time.

01:46.500 --> 01:52.360
At that point, I wasn't absolutely certain what it was that I would try writing, but

01:52.360 --> 02:03.880
when the opportunity finally presented itself in early 1962, I decided it might be easier

02:03.880 --> 02:09.720
for me to break into science fiction since I had read so much of it in the past, knew

02:09.720 --> 02:10.200
the area.

02:10.200 --> 02:15.920
So I decided I'd try there first, and I went out and re-familiarized myself with science

02:15.920 --> 02:16.300
fiction.

02:18.420 --> 02:24.820
Then I began writing and submitting the stories, and after about six or seven weeks, I sold

02:24.820 --> 02:25.640
my first one.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.800
I sold 16 others that year, so I stayed with it.

02:32.680 --> 02:37.600
Zalazny has always been recognized as a stylist, a writer to whom craftsmanship is important.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.140
His characters have depth, and his prose is coherent and flexible.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.480
Right, and that's an important point to make.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.460
Science fiction has traditionally been a field in which style and character were secondary

02:47.460 --> 02:48.500
to plot and idea.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.980
Zalazny's college background in his major field of study, English, may have had some

02:52.980 --> 02:54.000
influence on his writing.

02:54.940 --> 03:02.180
As an undergraduate, I was a psychology major, and I decided I did not really want to work

03:02.180 --> 03:07.580
as a psychologist, and it occurred to me somewhere along the line that if I'm simply

03:07.580 --> 03:14.360
going to be teaching and writing with the aim in mind of eventually writing full time,

03:14.500 --> 03:18.460
I might as well teach something that would be a little more fun than psychology.

03:18.460 --> 03:25.540
So I switched to English and took my graduate work in English and comparative literature.

03:26.520 --> 03:31.620
As a result of his background, Zalazny says, his stories had some characteristics not common

03:31.620 --> 03:32.960
to traditional science fiction.

03:33.680 --> 03:41.260
I suppose having grown up on the earlier sort of science fiction, the space opera sort of

03:41.260 --> 03:48.340
thing of the 30s and 40s too, and the harder science stories of the 40s and some of the

03:48.340 --> 03:59.840
sociological science fiction of the 50s, and having a background in literature, I, there's

03:59.840 --> 04:04.000
a natural tendency, whether it's conscious or not, to want to do something different

04:04.580 --> 04:06.440
than the things that had gone before.

04:07.340 --> 04:13.020
As a consequence, my stories, well the first ones were basically gimmick stories because

04:13.020 --> 04:15.520
it was the easiest way to break in.

04:15.620 --> 04:20.560
It was about all that I was capable of doing at the time, but when I began writing at greater

04:20.560 --> 04:26.140
length and when I was a bit sure of myself, I would think of the characters first so the

04:26.140 --> 04:32.000
stories tended to have more, I suppose, in the way of psychological motivation rather

04:32.000 --> 04:33.760
than just external characterization.

04:36.500 --> 04:44.380
My writing itself, possibly because of the years I spent writing poetry and reading

04:46.960 --> 04:55.460
general literature, tended to be a bit different from some of the earlier things which were

04:55.460 --> 04:57.160
kind of journalistic in character.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.640
More next time about Roger Zalazny.

05:08.330 --> 05:12.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

05:12.560 --> 05:16.860
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.160
Thank you.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.780
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:25.460 --> 06:30.400
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.880
And here are your hosts.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.560
This is David Carson.

06:40.780 --> 06:41.380
And Daryl Lane.

06:41.780 --> 06:45.660
Science fiction authors sometimes write fantasy, and fantasy authors sometimes write science

06:45.660 --> 06:47.540
fiction. Roger Zalazny writes both.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.180
He talks about the differences between the two forms.

06:51.240 --> 06:59.040
I do make the distinction myself. In a science fiction story, everything I feel should be

06:59.040 --> 07:05.660
explainable in terms of natural laws or extensions of natural laws as we understand them now.

07:06.920 --> 07:13.160
Whereas in a fantasy story, it's part of the rules of the game, so I feel there are

07:13.160 --> 07:19.920
no compunctions against invoking the supernatural or bringing in magic and things of that sort.

07:22.600 --> 07:28.400
And so basically a science fiction story, things are ultimately explainable in a fantasy

07:28.400 --> 07:35.520
story. They're explainable really in terms of something that isn't explainable. So you've

07:36.320 --> 07:45.360
got more, you've got the less rational background if you push things far enough in a fantasy

07:45.360 --> 07:45.800
story.

07:47.060 --> 07:50.500
So Zalazny says he writes some of his books so that they can be read either way.

07:51.840 --> 08:02.700
I also believe in mixing the two. Lord of Light, for instance, was a book where I intentionally

08:02.700 --> 08:11.380
wrote it to be taken two ways. A fantasy fan could read it as a piece of fantasy, whereas

08:11.380 --> 08:18.880
a science fiction fan also had options available to him. Any single item which occurs in there,

08:19.560 --> 08:24.960
which is of an unusual nature, is that there's ultimately an explanation available for it

08:24.960 --> 08:28.900
if the person cares to use it. If he doesn't, that's fine too.

08:29.980 --> 08:34.160
Zalazny makes an interesting point about science fiction. He says that sometimes a science

08:34.160 --> 08:37.320
fiction story will become a fantasy story after a certain amount of time.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.600
And he uses one of his own stories, A Rose for Ecclesiastes, as an example.

08:43.240 --> 08:50.700
It's kind of funny too because I think the first story for which I became known was a

08:50.700 --> 09:00.960
piece called A Rose for Ecclesiastes. And one of my reasons in writing this is because

09:00.960 --> 09:06.540
I was very fond of the earlier space operas and things like this, where they, John Carter

09:06.540 --> 09:16.800
of Mars, or, and I had always wanted to do something set on the Mars, which existed in

09:16.800 --> 09:22.160
these earlier stories. And I knew at the time I wrote it that it was scientifically impossible

09:22.160 --> 09:27.800
at that point. We already knew enough about Mars to know that the temperature was not

09:27.800 --> 09:32.100
the same as I had it in the story, that the atmosphere was not the same and so forth. But

09:32.100 --> 09:36.920
it was close enough to the point where this knowledge was just becoming current that I

09:36.920 --> 09:43.220
could still get away with doing a thing like that. So I intentionally wrote that and wrote

09:43.220 --> 09:50.520
it in the fashion I did. I was a kind of exercise in nostalgia on my part. I always wanted to

09:50.520 --> 10:02.040
do a story set on that kind of Mars and I knew that if I waited another year or so I

10:02.420 --> 10:06.840
would have my story in the doors of his face, the lamps of his mouth. At that point we already

10:06.840 --> 10:11.720
were aware that the surface temperature was about 900 degrees, but still there were these,

10:12.360 --> 10:19.240
there was this whole traditional body of science fiction literature which had a vast watery

10:19.240 --> 10:26.920
world, a misty and so forth, that I really had wanted to use at least once in my life.

10:26.920 --> 10:33.820
So I did those two stories as a kind of tribute to the earlier things. But then again I wrote

10:33.820 --> 10:41.880
them the way I was writing them rather than in the older style. So reading them now they

10:41.880 --> 10:47.860
have to be regarded as fantasy rather than science fiction because science has already

10:47.860 --> 10:50.560
demonstrated that those circumstances don't prevail.

10:51.330 --> 10:52.900
More on Roger's alasney tomorrow.

11:00.580 --> 11:05.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

11:05.220 --> 11:09.560
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:38.060 --> 11:39.500
Thank you.

11:56.640 --> 12:00.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:16.760 --> 12:26.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy. And here are your hosts.

12:30.900 --> 12:35.700
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. Many science fiction and fantasy authors these days write

12:35.700 --> 12:40.920
novels in series in three, four and sometimes five book sets. Jack Schocker's Well World

12:40.920 --> 12:45.860
series or Elizabeth Lynn's trilogy The Chronicles of Tornor are two good examples. It's a commercially

12:45.860 --> 12:49.960
attractive idea for one thing. If readers like the first book then there's a ready-made

12:49.960 --> 12:54.280
market for the following ones. And of course it also allows an author the scope to pursue

12:54.280 --> 12:58.560
a theme in greater depth and length than a single book would allow. And the extra depth

12:58.560 --> 13:02.860
can give an epic quality to the series. One of the best of the series is a set of five

13:02.860 --> 13:07.880
books by Roger's alasney, a science fantasy adventure called simply The Amber Series.

13:08.700 --> 13:13.660
The first volume is entitled Nine Princes and Amber and it was published in 1971. The

13:13.660 --> 13:18.780
other four are the Guns of Avalon, Sign of the Unicorn, The Hand of Oberon, and the Courts

13:18.780 --> 13:24.800
of Chaos. So alasney calls the book Something Beside Science Fantasy. Whenever I try anything

13:24.800 --> 13:29.900
of this sort I try to give an extra twist is what it is. Basically I look at it myself

13:29.900 --> 13:37.100
as a kind of heroic fantasy with a few variations that don't usually occur in that sort of

13:37.820 --> 13:42.820
literature. One of the variations alasney develops in the books is what's called the

13:42.820 --> 13:53.820
pattern. It is a kind of archetypal design which exists in the real world, amber, of

13:53.820 --> 14:05.600
which our own earth and a great variety of shadings and variations thereof exist. Amber

14:05.600 --> 14:12.480
is the real world earth and the others are referred to as shadow. Our shadow in the story

14:12.480 --> 14:21.560
is the background, the basis of reality in amber is this design called the pattern which

14:21.560 --> 14:33.640
was inscribed by an ancestor of the clan about whom the story is told. Only a person

14:33.640 --> 14:40.020
of the blood of the royal family of amber is able to walk this pattern and not be destroyed

14:40.020 --> 14:50.960
by it. And in the course of walking the pattern at some point in his early life the amberite

14:51.560 --> 14:58.360
acquires the ability to walk through the various shadow worlds which surround amber

14:58.360 --> 15:04.840
so that he can travel through an infinity of possibilities to virtually any world he

15:04.840 --> 15:10.080
desires. The basic plot of the series consists of a struggle for the throne of amber and

15:10.080 --> 15:14.100
in the process our earth is threatened with destruction since we are only a shadow of

15:14.100 --> 15:19.380
the real world of amber. In the struggle the main character Corwin keeps traveling between

15:19.380 --> 15:24.040
our earth and amber. Technology doesn't work in amber so the people there fight with swords

15:24.040 --> 15:28.960
and magic. For this reason the books are called science fantasy or as Zalazny said heroic

15:28.960 --> 15:34.820
fantasy. They've been very popular too. Zalazny says the readers have responded enthusiastically.

15:35.700 --> 15:39.640
I have gotten more fan letters on the amber books than anything else I've ever written.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.280
There was a period of a couple of years there I was getting several letters a week on the

15:46.280 --> 15:51.680
amber books. The narrative was concluded with an exciting climax in the fifth book the

15:51.680 --> 15:55.660
courts of chaos. Because of the wide reader response though and because there were some

15:55.660 --> 16:01.280
unanswered questions in that last book a sixth novel on amber is a possibility. There is

16:01.280 --> 16:07.020
possibly a sixth one. I have made no commitments I do not have a plot but I've been talking

16:07.020 --> 16:17.380
about it and thinking about it publisher. It is possible when I get a few things out

16:17.380 --> 16:24.200
of the way that I'm writing now that I might go on and do a sixth one. But so far as the

16:24.200 --> 16:31.320
five books that now exist are concerned that story is told. That was the story I had in

16:31.320 --> 16:37.300
mind. Anything which would continue the series would probably take off in a new direction.

16:37.440 --> 16:42.380
It could possibly be from another character's point of view. More about Roger Zalazny next

16:42.380 --> 16:54.660
time. This has been the science fiction radio show production of the Permian Basin Science

16:54.660 --> 16:59.060
Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.800
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show so stay with us.

18:10.040 --> 18:19.980
This is the science fiction radio show. A commentary on science fiction and fantasy. And here are your hosts.

18:24.660 --> 18:28.800
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. One of the more interesting time travel books in

18:28.800 --> 18:32.840
recent years is Roadmarks by Roger Zalazny. Though time travel is one of the traditional

18:32.840 --> 18:38.980
science fiction themes, Zalazny doesn't often write that type of story. I have always attempted

18:38.980 --> 18:47.300
to avoid time travel stories because I don't like the paradoxes involved. In fact the only

18:47.300 --> 18:53.680
thing I can think of that I had done in the past was a short story called Divine Madness

18:53.680 --> 18:59.980
where I said that I really wouldn't write a time travel story unless I came up with

18:59.980 --> 19:13.820
a new gimmick. Well for Roadmarks I thought I had something just in the image of time

19:14.480 --> 19:23.480
considered as a super highway basically and without the paradoxes in Everett Wheeler

19:23.680 --> 19:31.560
who parallel worlds sort of situation. It was really the image of the road that fascinated

19:31.560 --> 19:39.340
me and let my writing that particular book. Time is conceived as a super highway in Roadmarks

19:39.340 --> 19:44.700
with the exits leading to different eras throughout time. Zalazny has an interesting story to tell

19:44.700 --> 19:52.520
regarding the origin of the idea behind Roadmarks. I got the idea for that book here in New Mexico

19:52.520 --> 20:04.240
really one Sunday I was just off for a drive and I-25 which is a nice highway type road.

20:05.600 --> 20:13.000
Took a turn off and drove for a few minutes and the road rapidly degenerated until with

20:13.000 --> 20:18.840
a matter of minutes I was on a dirt road and I passed through a place that I couldn't

20:18.840 --> 20:27.960
find on the map. It was a little village where there was a horse pulling a wagon and no overhead

20:27.960 --> 20:35.260
electrical lines in sight. It was almost as if I had driven back through time into the

20:35.260 --> 20:43.560
19th century. There were log buildings and somewhere around there something started to

20:43.560 --> 20:48.100
click and as I drove back again and the road improved and improved until finally I was on

20:48.100 --> 20:56.420
the super highway I started working out the just the mechanisms for the idea of driving

20:57.040 --> 21:03.280
through time which I used in Roadmarks. Actually by the time I got home I had a number of the

21:03.280 --> 21:07.220
situations worked out and I sat down and began writing it.

21:13.840 --> 21:18.780
The protagonist is a man named Red Dorokin. He travels up and down this highway of time

21:18.780 --> 21:22.580
in a battered old pickup. And when he's not trying to avoid and outwit some assassins

21:22.580 --> 21:27.520
who are after him he's running guns to the Greeks back in the past at Marathon. And there's

21:27.520 --> 21:32.140
something else in the book that's a recurring motif or symbol. Huge dragons that float above

21:32.140 --> 21:36.700
the road occasionally. Their function is not clear but they seem to have some responsibility

21:36.700 --> 21:46.180
for the road. They were simply to represent the dark forces which I tend to bring in any

21:46.180 --> 21:53.220
fantasy novel. In a story like this there has to be a point where you have to ultimately

21:53.220 --> 22:00.300
reach something that's basically unexplainable. Namely where did the road come from and how

22:00.300 --> 22:07.760
did it come to function the way that it did. And in making a decision on that I could go

22:07.760 --> 22:16.460
either way. I could find some science fiction trappings and explain it or I could leave it

22:16.460 --> 22:23.600
intentionally. Something shadowy and with a more fantasy background. If I did that I

22:23.600 --> 22:29.440
decided I needed some symbol to invoke as an ultimate creator of the road. So hence the

22:29.440 --> 22:35.500
dragons and then they're tie in with red. Roadmarks published in 1981 is a different

22:35.500 --> 22:39.920
sort of time travel story tending toward the fantasy rather than the science fiction end

22:39.920 --> 22:44.580
of the spectrum. And since Rogers Alasney is responsible for it it's highly enjoyable

22:45.240 --> 22:56.960
and we'll have more on Rogers Alasney on our next show. This has been the science fiction

22:56.960 --> 23:02.040

24:55.500 --> 24:59.220
Writer Rogers Alasney has won numerous awards in the field of science fiction and fantasy

24:59.220 --> 25:01.280
and he's been writing it for some 20 years.

25:01.700 --> 25:05.800
So Alasney has a scholarly background which often shows up in his books. The way he uses

25:05.800 --> 25:11.060
mythology for instance in novels like Lord of Light or This Immortal or Psychology and

25:11.060 --> 25:11.800
the Dream Masters.

25:12.520 --> 25:16.980
He has a master's degree in literature and his knowledge of history is extensive. He's

25:16.980 --> 25:21.560
read deeply in the mythologies and early literature of mankind and he also reads a great deal

25:21.560 --> 25:24.200
of modern literature, both science fiction and otherwise.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.520
He has some interesting ideas on science fiction and fantasy and it's placed in the modern

25:28.520 --> 25:32.840
world. Science fiction is a special genre to him for a few basic reasons.

25:33.780 --> 25:44.960
It is for one reason, one of the few special places where you still deal with characters

25:44.960 --> 25:55.120
other than those which occur in the modern realistic or naturalistic novel. Going back

25:55.120 --> 26:02.100
to the critic, Northrop Fry, who spoke of characters in various modes. Science fiction

26:02.100 --> 26:09.140
is one of the few places outside of modern poetry where a writer can deal with characters

26:09.140 --> 26:15.560
in what he called the Chaimimetic or the Mythic modes, that is characters who are greater

26:15.560 --> 26:22.320
than their fellow man or characters who are godlike sometimes. In that science fiction

26:22.320 --> 26:30.740
does deal with mutants and aliens and sentient computers and cyborgs and robots. What have

26:30.740 --> 26:35.240
it just all categories of beings which are different than the characters you meet with

26:35.240 --> 26:40.400
in a naturalistic or realistic novel. So in that sense, and I think this is one of the

26:40.400 --> 26:45.520
great virtues of science fiction, it gives the writer more scope for exploration in terms

26:45.520 --> 26:46.120
of character.

26:58.140 --> 27:02.700
Besides the freedom or scope that science fiction provides for a writer, it also has

27:02.700 --> 27:07.420
one other quality that Zalazny feels differentiates it from general or mainstream literature.

27:08.600 --> 27:14.220
I think that science fiction is still basically for all of the experimentation that went on

27:14.220 --> 27:22.960
in the 60s, a bastion of storytelling. The idea is not necessarily the hero anymore as

27:22.960 --> 27:29.640
it was in these Kingsley Amos referred to as being such back in the 40s and perhaps

27:29.640 --> 27:35.460
the 50s, but we have real characters now and ideas are handled in a more sophisticated

27:35.460 --> 27:41.500
fashion. The writing has also improved from a stylistic standpoint, but basically I think

27:41.960 --> 27:49.800
if you looked at the area, well even statistically, there are more examples of straightforward

27:49.800 --> 27:58.000
storytelling in science fiction than you might find in general fiction at large. So that is

27:58.000 --> 28:05.140
another reason I am very fond of science fiction because I am basically a storyteller

28:05.140 --> 28:10.860
no matter what I do with mythology or writing devices.

28:11.480 --> 28:15.600
Does Zalazny think science fiction will ever merge with general literature and gain a wider

28:15.600 --> 28:16.100
acceptance?

28:17.400 --> 28:22.780
I don't think it will necessarily be merged with the mainstream and I also do not think

28:22.780 --> 28:33.500
that this is necessarily a bad thing at all. It was Santayana who said that about something

28:33.500 --> 28:40.280
else entirely, which I think is apropos, to attempt to give such things a wide currency

28:40.280 --> 28:50.400
is to be willing to denature them in order to post that they have been propagated. I

28:50.400 --> 28:56.260
always have its devotees and that they will grow in number just as the population itself

28:58.440 --> 29:04.200
increases, but I don't know that the percentage is ever going to increase greatly.

29:05.040 --> 29:09.540
The chances are pretty good that science fiction has at least a few more readers and fans than

29:09.540 --> 29:14.580
it would have had had Zalazny not taking it up. His works stand as an advertisement for

29:14.580 --> 29:16.480
the quality and value of good science fiction.

29:24.540 --> 29:29.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

29:29.780 --> 29:33.980
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

30:04.740 --> 30:07.540
Thank you.
