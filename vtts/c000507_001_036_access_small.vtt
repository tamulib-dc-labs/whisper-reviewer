00:02.000 --> 00:08.320
Okay, we're back on. Okay, back for just a moment. Do you pronounce it Lilith or Lilith, that first book of Lilith?

00:08.460 --> 00:08.520
Lilith.

00:08.520 --> 00:09.500
Lilith, I thought so. Okay.

00:09.560 --> 00:17.320
That's the first book that supposedly Adams other lover, you know. It's an apocryphal book of the Bible.

00:18.060 --> 00:27.840
Okay, the question I want to ask about, I guess this is asking an author what he meant by something. I'll try not to put it in those terms, but you have these two, I guess, societies.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.460
The big one, the Confederacy, which is technological and everybody conforms, they look alike, they think alike.

00:33.140 --> 00:45.400
On the other hand, you have the Society on Lilith where everybody is not only are the individuals, and not only do they not have any technology, but they are literally one with their environment because of the warden organism.

00:46.440 --> 00:52.160
I detected a great deal of sympathy on your part for that type of society. You know, an anti-technological one.

00:52.460 --> 00:56.240
Of course. Well, no. No, absolutely not.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.240
I'm under no circumstances anti-technological.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.480
I am not in any way anti-technological.

01:03.680 --> 01:09.520
I'm a big booster. I'm a great believer, for example, that genius can't be put back in models and most cases shouldn't be.

01:10.740 --> 01:19.980
What I am saying is that any technology developed, history shows, I'm a historian, I'm trained in history.

01:19.980 --> 01:29.280
History shows that any technological development that can be misused will be, and that it can also be used positively.

01:30.560 --> 01:44.900
And what we have is a politics, bureaucracy, and so on will tend to misuse it, but that they can never stamp out the individualism or the independence.

01:44.900 --> 01:50.020
I think I'm very optimistic of the fact that the human spirit always comes through.

01:51.840 --> 01:57.380
My people win, and they sometimes win with very sophisticated technological methods.

01:59.680 --> 02:11.900
What I'm really saying is that most of these futuristic civilizations are using technology to develop a least common denominator society,

02:12.560 --> 02:14.460
or lowest common denominator society.

02:15.360 --> 02:20.020
That is, it's the same thing when I was teaching.

02:20.600 --> 02:27.640
I mean, they would throw these enormous classes at me, and some of these people would be extremely advanced and extremely intelligent,

02:27.860 --> 02:40.260
and some of these people would be barely literate and unable to think for the next minute, let alone the next or the last hundred years.

02:41.260 --> 02:54.580
And you have the problem if you have a complete mix of these kind of things, you have the question of who do you teach to?

02:55.320 --> 02:59.260
It's too large to signal out the exceptions.

03:00.840 --> 03:08.680
I mean, when you're dealing with 160, 180 people, it's very difficult to teach to a dozen different levels.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.160
It's all at the same time.

03:11.860 --> 03:17.760
And you're almost forced into the lowest common denominator teaching standard as long as you've got the situation.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.840
One of the great crises of American education.

03:24.140 --> 03:32.140
A society totally sincere socialist society has much the same problems,

03:32.240 --> 03:36.420
and that they must address the lowest common denominator for all of their people.

03:37.740 --> 03:45.920
You know, you start with the basics and so on, but you really have nothing for the exceptional people without compromising your principles.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.960
Of course, what the socialist society does, they compromise their principles.

03:50.320 --> 03:56.500
They give privileges and extra pay and car and watches in the country, too.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.640
They're exceptional people.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.920
But if you don't compromise your principles and a larger group that you have to deal with,

04:02.980 --> 04:07.740
the less compromise you can have, the more you're addressed to this.

04:08.100 --> 04:11.540
And this is exactly what most of my future societies have.

04:11.620 --> 04:18.100
They just take current technology and they say, you know, these are not evil societies.

04:19.180 --> 04:23.740
If you take, these are very well-meaning societies.

04:23.740 --> 04:28.120
But they address, what they want to do is make everyone the same.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.560
They want to make everybody equal.

04:31.140 --> 04:36.580
They want to make, and in order to make everybody equal, you must make everyone the lowest common denominator.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.120
So I'm not even saying that it's a misuse of technology.

04:41.420 --> 04:45.160
It is simply the result of this idea.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.200
Everybody's going to say, oh, are you the monarchist or something?

04:48.300 --> 04:48.740
No, he's not.

04:49.420 --> 05:00.400
But all I am saying is that as long as you're forced, you're literally forced under this philosophy to go for the lowest common denominator,

05:01.620 --> 05:07.020
and that this is going to extinguish the human spirit.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.700
But they can't extinguish it.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.440
It keeps popping back up.

05:13.440 --> 05:17.880
And given an opportunity, it will pop back up.

05:18.580 --> 05:24.340
In the case of the Warden Diamond, you have it populated with the nonconformists,

05:24.440 --> 05:27.020
the ones that the system could not do.

05:27.180 --> 05:29.500
Some of these people should have really been executed.

05:30.260 --> 05:34.760
I mean, they're really psycho and they're really weird and they're really awful kind of people.

05:35.120 --> 05:40.820
And others are simply political dissidents, people who just simply cannot fit.

05:42.120 --> 05:53.460
And in the third book in the series, which is not out yet, which is much, much more complex and much more involved and much darker than the first two,

05:56.020 --> 06:05.460
we have at one point a character who says that they formed a core of a fastened secret police and so on

06:05.460 --> 06:09.040
to ferret out those who simply could not be adapted to the system.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.920
And they were sent here and they thought it was going to be a temporary thing.

06:13.020 --> 06:16.560
They thought that after a couple of hundred years this could be phased out.

06:18.360 --> 06:26.200
But no matter what they've done, no matter how many people they've tracked down, killed, reeducated, or exiled to the Warden Diamond,

06:26.280 --> 06:29.020
no matter what they've done, there's always somebody else.

06:29.980 --> 06:35.440
They just keep popping up because you can't repress it.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.900
It's going to be there.

06:38.820 --> 06:44.140
The most unremittingly depressing version of this is the well world confett...

06:44.140 --> 06:46.460
Not confetter, let's see, what is that?

06:47.340 --> 06:47.640
Generation?

06:48.120 --> 06:49.460
Yeah, or something like that.

06:51.420 --> 06:55.840
After sixteen books you get to the point where you don't remember what you used.

06:57.440 --> 07:05.480
But that's probably the most unremittingly depressing where they've gone even to the common denominator one better.

07:05.720 --> 07:10.060
They're genetically breeding everybody identically, this kind of thing.

07:11.100 --> 07:18.780
And the fact is that on those worlds you really don't have people popping up,

07:18.780 --> 07:22.480
but in the people who go between those worlds you do.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.860
They're sort of immune from this.

07:27.080 --> 07:35.520
There's also the theory in all the books that as long as you have a frontier, you can never totally suppress humanity.

07:36.860 --> 07:39.880
Yeah, I think that was the calm worlds in the well world series, brother.

07:40.100 --> 07:40.820
I think that's what it was.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.960
Yeah, okay, yeah, alright, that's fine.

07:43.680 --> 07:49.580
I suspect a little bit that that agent, the one who's monitoring all this, is starting to change some of his values because of what he's...

07:49.580 --> 07:59.020
Exactly what the part of what the book is about is that we have a sort of surrogate him down on each of these worlds,

08:00.220 --> 08:03.680
who starts off pretty much or almost identical to him.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.620
And he's following this whole thing with his whole system of values, beliefs, and so on.

08:09.620 --> 08:15.320
And he's watching the surrogates change into quite different people.

08:16.380 --> 08:21.780
And it begins to eat away at his own sense of value, his own sense of duty.

08:22.820 --> 08:32.720
As a matter of fact, in the third book he begins to realize that the people who sent him there on this mission anticipated this.

08:33.340 --> 08:40.320
And that his computer detective aide, who he has dialogues with and discusses everything with,

08:40.760 --> 08:43.500
may be more than that, it may be something of a watchdog.

08:45.820 --> 08:52.200
And he starts to have problems in figuring out how he's going to get around this computer.

08:52.420 --> 09:00.940
And of course in the fourth book he's going to have to because he's going to have, in the end, he's going to have all the pieces together.

09:00.940 --> 09:08.140
And he's going to have to really have it in his hand, the fate of millions, maybe billions of people.

09:09.780 --> 09:15.080
And he's going to have to decide how to balance this all out with the way he's now looking at things.

09:17.460 --> 09:19.980
And it's going to be a tremendous challenge.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.380
And I know it's going to be something of a challenge to write it.

09:25.620 --> 09:32.860
I do think that the solution to the entire thing is, I don't like cop-outs.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.560
I don't like stringing people along and then not delivering.

09:38.080 --> 09:44.300
You will get real, I don't know whether you can say flesh and blood, but something, aliens.

09:45.780 --> 09:49.820
And whatever they're made of, you will meet the aliens.

09:49.820 --> 09:58.500
You will have a face down and the solution to the whole thing and exactly what's going on is quite bizarre.

09:58.940 --> 10:00.540
And I don't think anybody's going to figure it out.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.160
And causes an even greater problem.

10:07.680 --> 10:13.900
Aliens are, of course, the most fun thing to do and also the most difficult to do well.

10:16.660 --> 10:18.460
Yeah, you said, oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.

10:18.460 --> 10:19.360
Oh, sorry.

10:20.040 --> 10:28.160
I mean, after all, we have something like the Well of Souls, since we have everybody starting from common denominator, Markovian.

10:29.860 --> 10:36.300
We can assume a lot of things in common between all of these races, no matter how weird they are.

10:37.240 --> 10:42.480
But we can't do that with a truly alien race.

10:43.480 --> 10:52.700
I think the best alien race I ever drew is coming up in a book from Pocket Books this July called The Identity Matrix,

10:53.760 --> 10:56.240
which is not really a book about aliens at all.

10:57.620 --> 11:02.640
It's a somewhat contemporary political thriller about mind control.

11:03.700 --> 11:09.660
But within it, it does have aliens who have the ability to body switch.

11:09.660 --> 11:17.460
And I think I've addressed for the first time how and why an alien society would develop such a system.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.680
It's an old gimmick.

11:21.260 --> 11:22.300
It's been used many times.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.800
Aliens are among us making change bodies with it.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.980
But what would cause a race to evolve or develop such a thing?

11:31.080 --> 11:35.840
And this is addressed and answered and shown within the book.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.040
I'm very proud of those aliens.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.020
Okay, that's out in July, huh?

11:40.760 --> 11:43.060
Yeah, that's going to shock a few people.

11:45.060 --> 11:55.040
It has all sorts of geeky sex and all sorts of bizarre things and so on happening within it.

11:56.180 --> 12:02.440
And if anyone, well the moral majority will hate that book.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.160
What's the other one?

12:04.340 --> 12:12.560
But what it actually does is it addresses, it's not the book you think you're reading when you start.

12:13.740 --> 12:19.240
If you start reading the book you will say, oh it's another, aliens are among us and they can body switch that book.

12:19.820 --> 12:20.680
And it's not.

12:20.960 --> 12:29.220
It's a story about what would happen if the United States government discovered that there were aliens among us and that they could body switch.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.660
But what any government does?

12:32.800 --> 12:34.760
You have a crash program, right?

12:35.740 --> 12:38.800
You have a crash program to find out how they do it.

12:39.420 --> 12:49.080
You take the best people, you take the best everything, the best computers, the best experts, biophysics, biochemistry, computer science and so on.

12:49.120 --> 12:55.720
You put them all together with an unlimited budget and you keep it very, very secret so that your brain doesn't get paranoid.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.460
You know, body snatchers and all that.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.280
It turns out the aliens aren't even interested in us, they just drop fire cages.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.420
They're totally irrelevant.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.240
But they crack the code.

13:07.600 --> 13:11.820
They crack, they never figure out how the aliens do it but they figure out another way to do it.

13:11.840 --> 13:17.600
Because once you demonstrate to the scientists that something can be done, he's going to figure out a way to do it.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.260
Given the proper money and material.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.100
And they do crack it.

13:24.220 --> 13:32.340
And once you can take this information and go from line to line using a digital encoding system.

13:33.320 --> 13:39.480
And it's a very tricky process because you can't, you can only take selective parts of the brain.

13:39.720 --> 13:44.800
You can't, otherwise you're going to stop heart, you're going to stop lungs, you know, all the autonomic services.

13:47.160 --> 13:56.160
And then, so once they can take selectively the information they want, store it and then feed it into a different place.

13:56.980 --> 14:00.620
They have the capacity not only to store, they have the capacity to edit.

14:03.040 --> 14:08.140
And once they have the capacity to edit, they can change your mind any way you want to.

14:11.140 --> 14:16.860
And naturally this is not necessarily in charge, being run by dirty types.

14:16.980 --> 14:19.800
This is being run by middle level government bureaucrats.

14:22.980 --> 14:28.420
And so the Washington Post discovers this and they don't try and cover it up.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.300
They invite the Washington Post supporters out.

14:30.940 --> 14:34.380
They give the Washington Post supporter a demonstration and nothing appears in the paper.

14:37.620 --> 14:40.500
And Congress bought the appropriations for things there.

14:40.620 --> 14:42.220
I'm not quite sure what's going on out there.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.360
So they invite the committee out, give them a demonstration.

14:45.680 --> 14:52.520
Then the committee comes and goes back, decides it's super secret, doesn't tell us all, and passes all the appropriations you want.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.140
And so on.

14:54.860 --> 14:55.760
That's what the public's about.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.560
Okay, yeah, that sounds interesting.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.440
Let me change direction for just a second.

15:01.440 --> 15:07.280
I'm sure you've spoken on this or written on this or thought about this great deal.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.600
What draws people to science fiction?

15:15.520 --> 15:30.760
Basically, I think that all people, Gene Roddenberry was one of them who pointed out the fact that you can do any type of novel, any type of story that you want.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.940
As science fiction or fantasy.

15:34.320 --> 15:37.780
That is, you can do a serious political novel.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.220
You can do a social commentary.

15:41.440 --> 15:58.920
You can do all sorts of serious stuff with science fiction and make it both more palatable and more comfortable to people because you set it in the far future or you put on, you put these interviews onto an alien race and it becomes easier for people to take.

16:01.160 --> 16:12.780
So that's the appeal to writing is that you have the ability to write any kind of book you want to write within its context.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.960
And you can be as subtle or as broad as you want it so on.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.960
It has a lot more freedom than the contemporary novel.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.920
Really, you've got very rigid screen.

16:26.240 --> 16:36.580
Then on the other hand, why people pick up science fiction fantasy, I think, is because first and foremost, because they want an escape.

16:37.900 --> 16:50.840
Because they really don't like, you know, I mean, you look at the evening news, you read the papers, you know, 20 dead in El Salvador this morning.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.420
15 house fires set by Matt Arsenault's downtown.

16:55.980 --> 16:58.220
Rape is up, you know, all of this kind of thing.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.320
They're scared to go down the street in many of the cities so on these days after dark.

17:04.580 --> 17:07.660
Seems like problems, problems, problems, unemployment lines.

17:08.840 --> 17:16.680
And then you can pick up science fiction fantasy and you can jump into that other world.

17:17.360 --> 17:22.460
And you can become a part of it and you can be what's something else, be somewhere else.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.280
So it's the ultimate escape literature.

17:25.900 --> 17:30.920
And of course, once we've got you in the escape literature, then we sneak in with serious stuff.

17:32.680 --> 17:39.620
Okay, then you do see it as having some value in terms of, oh, significance, say, social significance or something like that.

17:39.620 --> 17:52.020
Oh, absolutely. I think that a great deal of contemporary science fiction and fantasy is very much dealing with people, dealing with universals.

17:52.240 --> 17:58.900
You can, it's dealing, one of my best examples of this is if you go back to Dickens,

18:00.280 --> 18:04.760
Dickens wrote serious social commentary on the time.

18:04.760 --> 18:16.240
He was after the Union workhouses. He was after the terrible misuse of Trump labor and all these terrible things and all these social causes.

18:16.380 --> 18:22.760
He addressed social causes a lot. Almost none of these social causes are relevant today.

18:24.820 --> 18:28.040
The conditions of Oliver Twitz just don't exist right now.

18:29.040 --> 18:37.520
We may have our own different things, but those issues that concerned him no longer concerned us, and yet we read and enjoy Dickens.

18:38.420 --> 18:43.480
And the reason why we do is because he addressed something beyond his social cause.

18:44.280 --> 18:48.080
First of all, he gave us plots and characters that we can involve ourselves into.

18:48.880 --> 18:54.620
Second of all, he sat down and he addressed something that we can recognize.

18:55.440 --> 19:08.180
There are universals in there, greed, bureaucracy, good, evil, right, wrong, all of these universal things.

19:08.840 --> 19:16.540
You know, what should and shouldn't be done that transcend his time and his personal causes of that time.

19:16.540 --> 19:26.140
And I think that serious writers of science fiction and fantasy are very much in the same situation.

19:27.160 --> 19:38.040
The further away we get from contemporary settings, the more we can deal with these universals, these problems, these questions.

19:38.040 --> 19:45.960
And it is a very, very serious literature, not for everybody who writes it, but then again, that we check the best Sutter List lately.

19:48.960 --> 19:52.400
And see how many serious novels you've actually got on the Sutter List.

19:54.800 --> 20:06.520
But I think that a serious novelist with serious things to say can do it better, easier, and in a way more timeless in science fiction and fantasy than he can in the contemporary novel.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.880
And I've written both and we'll write both again.

20:10.620 --> 20:12.260
Okay, excellent. That's a fine answer.

20:13.220 --> 20:14.560
Sort of related to that.

20:15.260 --> 20:19.320
Usually when we talk to different authors, we always ask them their opinion on this particular subject.

20:21.840 --> 20:28.180
There is a distinction, or at least people believe there is one, between so-called mainstream literature and science fiction.

20:28.700 --> 20:33.080
Some authors believe it's simply something the publishing industry does, if there is no distinction.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.720
Others think they should be kept separate.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.900
Norman Spindrad thinks they are the same thing, they should not be separate.

20:39.880 --> 20:45.880
Do you think that there is a distinction? Are there actually different kinds of literature, mainstream and science fiction, and should they be kept separate?

20:46.420 --> 20:46.980
No, they aren't.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.060
There's no way that you can. It is rather odd, though.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.820
It's an ambivalent answer.

20:55.260 --> 21:04.080
Clifford Simac once said that there is some difference because science fiction writers, you will find writing every other form of literature.

21:05.200 --> 21:09.620
Mysteries, romances, mainstream war novels, you name it.

21:09.700 --> 21:14.660
But when people who write other things try and write science fiction, they usually fall flat on their face.

21:18.120 --> 21:35.220
But I'm not sure whether that just doesn't address the fact that people who, writers who are attracted to science fiction, simply have to have a little more versatility in a wider range than someone who is writing detective novels.

21:37.020 --> 21:41.660
On the other hand, I really don't think there is any difference except what the publishers put on it.

21:42.200 --> 21:52.240
For example, I've never seen the word science fiction or fantasy connected with Stephen King at all, and he is nothing if he is not a science fiction and fantasy writer almost exclusively.

21:54.600 --> 21:59.800
Frank Herbert gets on the best-seller list with God Emperor of Thune.

22:01.020 --> 22:09.780
So Farmer is on the best-seller list with, I mean, the regular best-seller list with some of the River World books, and McCaffrey got on with the White Dragon.

22:11.400 --> 22:24.660
We take a look at some of these things. There is a very conscious effort on the part of publishers to differentiate, not just science fiction, but also called category fiction.

22:25.400 --> 22:29.460
Because they feel that they feel more secure that way.

22:29.460 --> 22:33.740
There is a bedrock of people who will buy science fiction.

22:34.120 --> 22:39.460
And a bedrock of people who buy modern romance. And a bedrock of people who buy detective.

22:39.960 --> 22:49.400
And if you can categorize them, you automatically have that base market that 30,000 or 40,000 people who buy that particular category.

22:49.400 --> 23:02.020
And it's very comforting because it means that if they can categorize it and if they can make it easy for the people to find it in stores that way, that they will automatically reduce or minimize their potential losses.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.740
They're starting off with a good bedrock.

23:06.220 --> 23:16.800
On the other hand, you do find a conscious effort on the part of publishers to deny that science fiction or fantasy is science fiction or fantasy.

23:16.800 --> 23:21.680
When they believe it has broader bestseller repeal. King is a very good example of that.

23:22.860 --> 23:32.700
But not the only one. A Neville shoot. About 70% of Neville shoots work is basically science fiction. And yet you'll never see that.

23:35.240 --> 23:57.340
You have an artificially created ghetto. But frankly, the only thing you notice is that if they are going for bestseller status deliberately, they simply try and remove all category labels when they market it and when they promote it.

23:57.340 --> 24:12.820
But there really isn't that much difference. An awful lot of people write an awful lot of stuff. And some of it, a great deal of it is science fiction or fantasy. Whether or not it's categorized that way.

24:15.860 --> 24:21.160
The ghettoization of it is strictly a marketing thing. Does that answer the question?

24:21.160 --> 24:35.620
Yes, it does. And that leads nicely into my next one. I probably agree with what you say, but I don't think in any other field, any other category of fiction that I can think of is there such a unique relationship between readers and authors.

24:36.680 --> 24:41.040
Conventions and fanatics that sometimes fans can be and so forth.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.340
Well, fans are short for fanatics.

24:42.400 --> 24:51.600
But that sort of relationship between working authors and the readers, through the conventions, through the mail, through the fanzines. No other field has that, does it?

24:51.600 --> 25:04.120
Yeah, to an extent. Although I will admit that most of the other categories that have it were have it because people from science fiction who are also interested in that moved on.

25:05.700 --> 25:13.440
The media oriented conventions, character conventions were all done by science fiction people. The comics conventions were all done by science fiction people.

25:15.240 --> 25:21.980
There's a modern romance convention on Long Island, which has a lot of science fiction people involved, organizationally, and so on.

25:22.260 --> 25:27.140
And there's a mystery convention every year that's done mostly by science fiction people.

25:28.040 --> 25:34.340
I think that they're better organized at it because they've got 40 years practice. They know how to do it.

25:34.340 --> 25:42.840
But on the other hand, I do kind of wonder whether or not we really have this as much as people think.

25:43.780 --> 25:59.480
There are maybe 5,000 people worldwide who are active in a more than once a year type of situation or one event situation in the science fiction fandom.

26:00.360 --> 26:04.960
And yet, you know, I saw many in copies.

26:06.760 --> 26:11.700
There were the other 995 people. See what I mean?

26:12.220 --> 26:12.380
Yeah.

26:13.060 --> 26:24.380
The fact is that anybody who really depended on these started it up, which is something that is very hard sometimes for the science fiction fans to accept.

26:25.220 --> 26:30.160
They do have a disproportionate influence, but only in one area.

26:30.720 --> 26:34.260
They have a disproportionate influence in terms of the awards.

26:37.360 --> 26:49.420
And that's the only area because it's the members of the World Science Fiction Convention, for example, each year that goes to Hugo, which are very prestigious awards.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.520
It means a lot of money to science fiction writers.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.760
How do they mean money, by the way?

26:56.200 --> 27:11.120
The Hugo, because it's been around now so long and it's had so much publicity and it's been so well promoted by the industry, is generally recognized by the regular science fiction book mind public.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.200
Most of them do not know how the Hugo is actually given.

27:15.880 --> 27:16.040
Hello.

27:16.540 --> 27:17.100
Yeah, I'm here.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.560
Oh, okay. I just heard a quick there.

27:20.740 --> 27:35.800
And as a result, the fact is that I remember one Hugo winner who said that when she got on a train to go home, she had her Hugo with her under her arms.

27:35.880 --> 27:36.780
She wasn't going to let it go.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.740
And they conduct her on the train.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.240
He looked down and he said, isn't that a Hugo?

27:45.080 --> 27:50.700
So, yeah, in other words, basically, obviously the conductor reads science fiction.

27:51.700 --> 27:53.260
He recognized the award.

27:53.540 --> 27:54.640
He just did not recognize.

27:55.980 --> 28:00.820
He didn't know anything about how it was awarded or anything else, but he knew it was an enormously prestigious award.

28:00.820 --> 28:13.080
Therefore, putting Hugo award winning author on the front of a book means that these non fans will recognize this as something single out of exceptional.

28:13.640 --> 28:14.560
They will buy it.

28:16.640 --> 28:22.520
It's worth quite a lot of money to someone who has not won one.

28:23.600 --> 28:31.000
I doubt it seriously whether it would mean a dime to an Azimov or an Arthur Clark or Robert Heinlein.

28:31.300 --> 28:34.380
You know, these people already have their white mark.

28:35.020 --> 28:38.180
But it means an awful lot to particularly first time winners.

28:40.640 --> 28:53.820
And it means that the publisher knows that by putting this on there, they're automatically going to have sales two or three times what they would have otherwise without even bothering to promote it.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.680
And of course, you are going to promote it.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.880
It gives you promotion money as well.

28:57.880 --> 29:07.280
Which means that I believe somebody has estimated that the minimum worth for Hugo, the minimum worth is around $50,000.

29:09.220 --> 29:10.500
Okay, that is interesting.

29:10.660 --> 29:11.540
I'm going to pay for a $35 award.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.220
Yeah, that is interesting.

29:13.360 --> 29:19.380
From the point of view of a profession like yourself, is the nebula one to be more desired than the Hugo?

29:19.880 --> 29:21.120
I think the Hugo is more desired.

29:21.460 --> 29:25.680
I think the Hugo is, as I say, commercially recognized.

29:26.500 --> 29:31.600
The nebula, unfortunately, it sounds great.

29:31.860 --> 29:36.420
It's an award given by the science fiction writers to themselves.

29:37.300 --> 29:40.780
But because it's such a small group that does it.

29:41.320 --> 29:51.640
And because of an inordinately complex and ridiculous system of nominations and a lot of politicking, Oscar-style politicking and everything else,

29:52.440 --> 29:58.520
it really boils down to leaks of friends being able to nominate themselves year after year.

30:00.040 --> 30:03.560
And the nebula is quite often won by a mere 40 votes.

30:04.840 --> 30:11.740
I would have thought that of the two awards, the Hugo would probably be given more on politics or caprice or such things like that.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.780
No, because it's got a much wider base.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.060
You may have thousands of votes.

30:17.480 --> 30:24.540
And you know these votes are going to come both from the professional community, not only writers but editors, publishers, artists and so on.

30:25.140 --> 30:32.120
But they're also going to come from the hardcore science fiction fans, the people who read this far more than the general public does.

30:32.860 --> 30:35.820
The average person in this country buys what is it, six or seven books a year?

30:37.000 --> 30:39.240
And we all know what those six or seven books are.

30:40.280 --> 30:49.040
So we're talking about people who buy 20, 40, 50, maybe 100 science fiction books a year and read them.

30:50.560 --> 30:58.440
And so the combination of that, several thousand people, it makes it, it makes leaking and politicking almost impossible.

31:00.400 --> 31:04.520
Okay, let me get back to you for a minute before we finish up here.

31:04.580 --> 31:06.140
I don't have too much more to ask.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.020
By the way, I won't take either award.

31:08.020 --> 31:09.140
Yeah, I'm sure.

31:10.060 --> 31:13.560
Well, I don't see how you can miss on some of the things you've been writing. I really don't.

31:13.740 --> 31:15.720
I've never been nominated.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.000
Never even nominated?

31:17.360 --> 31:17.520
No.

31:18.100 --> 31:18.820
That's incredible.

31:20.660 --> 31:24.500
I don't see how you can miss on this new series though. There must be something that's going to come out of that.

31:24.880 --> 31:25.620
Well, we'll see.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.560
You're not a prime, you're eligible.

31:40.360 --> 31:48.860
And the fact is that many people, particularly the more serious ones, the likely voters, quite often wait until all the books in the series,

31:49.060 --> 31:53.200
if it's a fixed series of four books, before they read it. By that time it's too late.

31:54.900 --> 31:55.340
Yeah.

31:56.420 --> 31:56.860
Yeah.

31:57.940 --> 32:01.060
Okay, listen, but just a little bit here about your working habits.

32:01.060 --> 32:04.840
So are you a disciplined writer or you work sort of erratically according to mood,

32:04.980 --> 32:07.400
or how do you go about your actual writing process?

32:09.060 --> 32:09.300
Whoops.

32:09.700 --> 32:10.320
Yeah, I'm still here.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.160
Yeah, that's a call coming in on another line.

32:12.620 --> 32:13.480
Do you want to catch it?

32:14.180 --> 32:15.420
If you can hold for just a minute.

32:15.540 --> 32:15.740
Surely.

32:16.520 --> 32:16.800
Hang on.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.200
Sometimes these phones really get particular.

32:23.180 --> 32:24.860
Okay, we got the tape rolling again. Go ahead.

32:25.620 --> 32:26.680
Do you remember the question?

32:27.700 --> 32:28.100
No.

32:28.100 --> 32:31.780
How about your working habits, if you're a disciplined writer or erratically?

32:31.960 --> 32:36.220
Yeah, I hear, I mean, I know Fred Paul and Roger's left me fairly well.

32:37.020 --> 32:42.860
They have this rigid rule, they crank out so many words a day, either new or revision, you know,

32:43.000 --> 32:46.660
and they're absolutely religious, break the can to another one like that.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.380
And I can't do that.

32:50.300 --> 32:55.880
There may be fairly long curious when I do nothing, and then I will go into a fair.

32:57.220 --> 32:58.800
However, I'm always working.

33:00.320 --> 33:04.780
I'm disciplined in the sense, maybe even more of a sense,

33:05.020 --> 33:08.640
than some other writers in the sense that before I sit down as a typewriter,

33:08.800 --> 33:10.100
I already know the whole book.

33:11.400 --> 33:14.660
I approach books in the same way that Albert Hitchcock approached movies,

33:15.680 --> 33:17.920
where you work out everything in advance.

33:19.060 --> 33:24.440
You work it out in your head, you work it out until, by the time you get down to writing it,

33:24.440 --> 33:26.500
it is mostly a mechanical exercise.

33:28.020 --> 33:31.700
So somebody says, well gee, how long did it take you to write Midnight at the Wall of Souls?

33:31.880 --> 33:33.020
Well, it took me five weeks to write.

33:33.580 --> 33:39.740
It took me about a year between the concept and everything else.

33:40.420 --> 33:45.940
By the time I had everything completely worked out and had the book solidly in my mind,

33:46.360 --> 33:50.440
then I could sit down and write it, and then it took me five weeks to type it.

33:54.580 --> 33:59.780
So there are long periods of time when I'm choosing which project to go next,

34:00.060 --> 34:05.960
and then when I seize on one, I work it out, try and form it up, see what's ready to go,

34:07.020 --> 34:14.380
then develop the entire thing, sketch it out on my mind and on crazy notepads, and you name it.

34:15.080 --> 34:19.720
And when I finally got it pretty well completely worked out.

34:19.720 --> 34:23.920
There may be a few gaps here and there, but the basics are all there.

34:25.540 --> 34:30.800
Only then do I sit down and then it's better just simply typing out the book, and that goes pretty fast.

34:31.140 --> 34:39.640
So I can sometimes do, using the system, I sometimes do 30, 40, 50 pages a day.

34:41.420 --> 34:42.220
Yeah, okay.

34:44.020 --> 34:49.900
But am I disciplined in the sense of writing every single thing? No, I'm not.

34:51.500 --> 34:58.280
I find that if I try and write X number of words a day, every day, I wind up having to destroy most of the words.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.540
Wait a time.

35:02.020 --> 35:05.040
The time I get to sit down, there should be a minimal amount of rewriting.

35:05.260 --> 35:07.520
You should read mostly my first draft because it should be right.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.760
Yeah. Did you say a little while ago that you were working on a fantasy book right now?

35:12.940 --> 35:13.040
Yeah.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.660
Like pure fantasy, I mean.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.420
Fantasy Quest book.

35:19.460 --> 35:29.000
Although it's, since Four Lords is a pretty serious book, pretty serious set, I wanted to do something that was a bit less serious.

35:29.680 --> 35:34.820
And I'm getting actually a little bit tired of fantasy Quest cliches.

35:36.120 --> 35:46.300
And so I am writing a large, involved fantasy Quest novel in which things are not going to be the way anybody expects them.

35:47.860 --> 35:51.020
And in which it will be more than a little bit cockeyed.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.820
It will not be necessarily broad comedy.

35:55.640 --> 35:59.200
And there'll be a lot of serious pastures, a lot of serious episodes in it.

35:59.940 --> 36:07.400
I'm not going to make fun of fantasy as such, but I am going to make fun of all these people doing the same fantasy over and over again.

36:11.440 --> 36:21.560
And people are going to be taken aback when they settle back very comfortably and then cover the things that aren't quite the way they imagine them.

36:22.580 --> 36:35.680
I guess a good example would be one episode where I've got, where the hero, this is a very, very much an 80s type episode where the hero comes into the small village and all the young women trying to overthrow themselves,

36:35.880 --> 36:37.700
adding them beg to be seduced and abandoned.

36:39.140 --> 36:45.080
And it's some time before he realizes that it's not a sex appeal, but that a great dragon has been seen in the area.

36:45.380 --> 36:47.360
Everybody knows the dragon's the eat only version.

36:49.860 --> 36:54.840
And since it's a good and moral upstanding town, they can't get any help from the people there.

36:55.420 --> 36:58.560
Because I have people there, what a virgin to sacrifice.

36:59.520 --> 37:04.440
And as a result, every stranger that comes along gets propositioned.

37:05.760 --> 37:10.700
Yeah, I imagine that'll be marketed as pure fantasy and some people will be a little surprised when they read it then, huh?

37:11.320 --> 37:12.160
Yeah, well, yeah.

37:12.160 --> 37:15.440
I'm naming it. I'm naming it at the fantasy market.

37:15.720 --> 37:21.340
Although, of course, I have a large number of people who will buy anything with my name on it, which is nicely comfortable.

37:23.700 --> 37:27.600
So I've done one fantasy before. I did it and the devil will drag you under.

37:29.960 --> 37:35.700
So nobody's ever decided whether midnight at the Well of Souls is fantasy or science fiction and I let them play around with it because I don't really care.

37:36.980 --> 37:37.340
Okay.

37:38.180 --> 37:45.560
In this case, though, I'm deliberately, I mean, we'll have our dragons and our unicorns and everything else.

37:46.060 --> 37:53.720
And we'll have our great classic fantasy quest and all the heroic battles and everything else.

37:53.740 --> 37:58.260
Except as I say, it's not going to be quite the way everybody expects it to be.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.020
Okay, let me change direction for just a minute. Now, we're just about running out of tape.

38:04.240 --> 38:15.300
What about this is something that I always wonder about, not because I'm personally interested, but I've heard people say this before, that science fiction, the field is one of the best areas for a young writer to get into.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.320
Well, it would normally be true. Normally.

38:21.200 --> 38:26.400
Although, of course, I don't think that anyone can get into this field unless they're well grounded in it.

38:27.400 --> 38:38.400
No science fiction fantasy very well, because they before they can go to the wider audience, they have got to reach that hardcore, that 30,000 readership.

38:39.080 --> 38:43.560
Otherwise, they're going to get bought. And to do that, you've got to know your field very well.

38:44.860 --> 38:50.660
Right now, of course, it's a time of cutbacks. I would not like to be a new writer starting right now.

38:51.960 --> 39:03.340
Because, well, I'm having no trouble selling and say Norman's been wrapped up having no trouble selling. Certainly a number of other established professionals are having no trouble selling.

39:05.920 --> 39:10.620
Newcomers, if they sell it all, they're going to sell for peanuts and they're going to get the responsible deal.

39:10.620 --> 39:21.460
Because nobody's interested anymore. All the publishing companies are now owned by the Hollywood divisions of massive international conglomerates.

39:22.500 --> 39:30.400
They're looking for a media type of deal. They're looking for best seller status. They're looking for people that are going to make money with minimum risk.

39:31.080 --> 39:33.660
So the old established professionals have the advantage there.

39:36.160 --> 39:40.040
And the newer writers, they're not really interested anymore in the newer generation of writers.

39:40.960 --> 39:45.440
I've witnessed the fact that all the big money and all the big promotions are going to the people who've been writing for 30 years.

39:47.520 --> 39:48.540
What about the magazines?

39:49.300 --> 39:53.620
Well, certainly. I think the short fiction in, there's a good deal of opening.

39:54.540 --> 40:01.200
And of course, that's a way in the back door if you do a large and successful fund of short fiction.

40:02.080 --> 40:09.180
And you build your audience that way and then you can go with your novel to the publishers and say, I have the audience already.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.960
I was John Broddy did and went that route. Joe Haldeman went that route.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.280
And that's an exceptionally good route.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.580
Sure, in the web it's about to do that route sometimes.

40:17.900 --> 40:23.100
There's the Ritkel. Just start creating the novel.

40:23.240 --> 40:27.020
Novels are the only way you can make money. You cannot make money doing short fiction.

40:28.280 --> 40:33.980
But you can establish a strong reputation in the short fiction.

40:34.520 --> 40:40.200
And they're certainly wide open to new faces.

40:41.180 --> 40:51.240
Analog and Azamog in particular are always interested in new faces because they have to fill a specific amount of space every single month.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.980
They have 13 issues a year because of their schedule.

40:54.740 --> 40:59.860
And it's awful a lot when you've got to fit in short stories, novelettes, mix them all together.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.060
So yeah, they're open and they're interested.

41:05.020 --> 41:19.000
So the field is open. The trouble is, of course, there are only really three magazines and a few peripheral magazines where you can do it.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.360
They're just hard enough to place.

41:22.860 --> 41:29.780
Azamog, Analog and Fantasy and Science Fiction are the three primary in the field markets to build a reputation.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.300
There's Omni, of course, but they only buy two stories a month.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.240
And you can imagine the amount of stories they get.

41:38.520 --> 41:47.620
And then back over in Arizona there's Amazing, but it pays not at all and it has such a small circulation that it says,

41:47.620 --> 41:49.460
they're going to make much of a reputation.

41:51.740 --> 41:53.840
And that's really, really about it.

41:56.860 --> 42:00.420
The trouble is it's not economical to do magazines anymore.

42:02.400 --> 42:10.620
Any magazine that cannot be advertised or supported isn't terrible trouble because they not only have trouble getting shelf space when they're local newsstands,

42:10.620 --> 42:17.980
they have equal trouble just in postage rates alone with a subscription limit.

42:19.980 --> 42:21.420
Probably expensive to do magazines.

42:23.920 --> 42:27.620
Okay, listen, we're just about running out of tape. There are a lot more things.

42:27.880 --> 42:33.780
I'm enjoying this talking to you immensely, but I'm thinking we're taking a lot of your time and we are running out of tape.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.780
Well, I don't mind time that much.

42:35.780 --> 42:39.960
Yeah, well, I was going to ask you, I think this is all the tape we brought for the interview.

42:40.280 --> 42:42.180
We're probably going to end here, but listen.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.760
I warned you.

42:44.040 --> 42:53.680
Yeah, well listen, I was going to ask you if there's anything that, any topics or anything you'd like to add or that you'd like to get on the air or anything like that.

42:54.880 --> 42:58.560
Oh, I can't really think of anything. I can go for hours on it.

42:58.580 --> 43:00.800
Yeah, that's sort of a dumb question.

43:00.800 --> 43:18.280
But listen, what we'd like to do perhaps is, oh, I don't know, some of your future books come out, maybe call, call you up, date some of the things and do a, do another show on, see, because our shows, what we do is we get this, you know, this interview and then we, we edit them into five minute shows.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.180
We're on the air every day.

43:19.840 --> 43:28.060
And so, you know, calling you up sometime, maybe one of your books comes out and getting some more information, doing a spot show on that here and there might be a big help to us too.

43:28.060 --> 43:30.680
That'd be fine with me. So, no trouble at all.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.160
Yeah, and, am I going to hear any of these shows?

43:33.200 --> 43:35.000
Well, okay, the situation is this.

43:36.460 --> 43:40.500
We were on the air for one year locally here in West Texas.

43:41.120 --> 43:43.280
Once a, once a week, 30 minute show.

43:44.380 --> 43:51.400
Okay, we sent some sample tapes to, well, to the Longhorn Radio Network, which is a national network.

43:51.400 --> 44:01.300
They liked it and said, okay, we'll take it for national distribution, national syndication, but we want a five minute format for every day of the week, which is a tremendous change for us.

44:01.740 --> 44:09.500
So, we have been retooling and regearing for that and we start, we start nationally, I guess, the first of April.

44:12.080 --> 44:17.000
And we don't know which stations are picking it up because the brochure has just been mailed.

44:18.560 --> 44:21.220
Yeah, listen, we will send you copies of the tapes and when we,

44:21.840 --> 44:30.660
Oh, we will do that and when we find out which stations are picking it up, we can even let you know that, but it's really up to the, any station in the country that wants it can pick it up.

44:31.220 --> 44:33.900
So, we don't know how many are going to take it as of yet.

44:34.740 --> 44:40.680
Because I can tell you when, when and if I know it's coming, you're going to put it in this area.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.260
I can notify you, Valentine pocket.

44:44.600 --> 44:51.880
Yeah. Those types of your PR department can, yeah, can hype it and that's fine.

44:52.380 --> 44:53.760
Promotion is a lot in this business.

44:53.920 --> 44:57.060
Well, yeah, we're, yeah, we're beginning to realize that that's absolutely true.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.640
We're working on some angles too that are going to help us some, we think.

45:01.580 --> 45:09.360
But yeah, we will let you know, we'll give you the tapes, we'll let you know when they give us some dates and some stations, we will let you know.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.320
I'd like to hear how it airs.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.080
Oh, surely, yeah.

45:11.840 --> 45:16.180
And then surely we're hearing it over the air, although I would like to know pretty much.

45:16.360 --> 45:16.540
Yeah.

45:17.080 --> 45:23.080
For publicity purposes, I'd like to know where it's going, but just out of curiosity, I'd like to hear it come down.

45:23.160 --> 45:25.720
Sure, well, yeah, well, the tapes that we would send here would be the air copies.

45:26.280 --> 45:28.640
You know, they'd be the ones that would be on the air, so you could tell from that too.

45:30.000 --> 45:30.320
Yeah.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.020
Okay, well, listen, that was immensely interesting.

45:33.360 --> 45:36.080
We sure appreciate your time, Mr. Chalker.

45:36.080 --> 45:40.240
And I'll be waiting for your future books, all of us will, we're all fans of your work.

45:40.400 --> 45:44.520
We've got two coming out this year, we've got the third of the four lords and we've got Dene DeMatrix.

45:44.920 --> 45:45.120
Yeah.

45:45.300 --> 45:48.680
And Ballantine is reissuing almost my whole backlist.

45:48.920 --> 45:49.900
Yeah, that's great.

45:51.300 --> 45:53.480
So then, well, see, that's where the money is.

45:53.680 --> 45:53.940
Yeah.

45:54.620 --> 45:55.780
That's really where the money is.

45:57.000 --> 46:05.700
It's once you've paid off, once they've sold enough that your advance has long since gone and just twice a year you get these marvelous checks,

46:06.080 --> 46:07.180
and you have to do another thing for them.

46:08.260 --> 46:12.160
And the more of those books you can keep in print, the more money you get.

46:12.240 --> 46:13.620
Well, I hope the movies come through too.

46:14.020 --> 46:16.060
Well, I'd love that because that would help all the books.

46:16.200 --> 46:16.560
Yeah.

46:17.320 --> 46:20.300
And would allow me to do some other stuff.

46:20.740 --> 46:21.000
Yeah.

46:21.160 --> 46:25.760
And I have not found any trouble, by the way, selling mainstream.

46:26.440 --> 46:26.840
Yeah.

46:27.220 --> 46:36.060
As a matter of fact, thanks to John Jakes and people like that, it's not bad at all to have a science fiction writer walk in.

46:36.080 --> 46:38.300
Hey, I've got this book or this series.

46:42.300 --> 46:47.120
They're very impressed with science fiction writers now in the mainstream, but they don't, of course, they don't want science fiction books.

46:47.480 --> 46:47.720
Yeah.

46:49.600 --> 46:55.740
Unless you already have the movie tie-in or you have this movie, blockbuster, so that you can do a Stephen King.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.620
In which case, then, they don't want you to write science fiction anymore.

47:00.120 --> 47:00.480
Yeah.

47:01.480 --> 47:03.200
Well, okay then, listen, we better let you go.

47:06.080 --> 47:06.380
Yeah.
