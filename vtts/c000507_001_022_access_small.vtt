Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.380 --> 00:39.100
And here are your hosts.

00:43.380 --> 00:44.540
This is Daryl Lane.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.480
And David Carson.

00:46.020 --> 00:51.720
Ray Bradbury is a name familiar not to just readers of science fiction or fantasy, but to almost any literate American or European.

00:52.320 --> 00:59.560
Some of Bradbury's work, like the Martian Chronicles or Fahrenheit 451, are classics that are admired by readers of all kinds and of all tastes.

00:59.560 --> 01:08.520
He does indeed write science fiction, and fantasy, and horror, and weird stories, but they're all done with a style and emotional texture that is unique to Bradbury.

01:09.220 --> 01:13.640
Bradbury wrote from a very early age, as far back as his grammar school days in the Midwest.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.920
But it wasn't until he was 19 and living in Los Angeles that he got the push that helped him to get published.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.320
He tells us about a group of science fiction writers in Los Angeles that gave him that push.

01:24.380 --> 01:31.480
Bruce Yerke, who was the secretary for the Science Fantasy Society, wrote me a letter in October of 1937.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.700
That was my last year in high school.

01:34.220 --> 01:38.360
They invited me to come down to Clifton's cafeteria and meet the group.

01:38.720 --> 01:43.560
And I was very shy and a little fearful. I didn't know anyone.

01:44.200 --> 01:49.880
But nevertheless, I got my courage together and went down to a meeting.

01:49.880 --> 01:56.060
And that was my first encounter with Forrest Ackerman, who became my first editor.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.900
He was editing a magazine called Imagination.

01:59.640 --> 02:10.920
And then along over the next year or so, I met Henry Kupner, Arthur Barnes, Lee Brackett, Robert Heinlein, Jack Williamson, Ross Rockland, Henry Hassey.

02:11.540 --> 02:16.580
They all became friends. And in one way or another, influenced me.

02:16.580 --> 02:23.800
We were very close. And I was beginning to write a lot of very bad science fiction, very bad fantasy.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.540
I still haven't learned to write well.

02:26.060 --> 02:28.560
But these people were very patient with me.

02:29.100 --> 02:38.640
And especially I remember Robert Heinlein and his wonderful wife, who invited me up to their home on occasion.

02:39.340 --> 02:44.180
I got to read a lot of his manuscripts before they were published.

02:44.180 --> 02:57.000
He was just starting to write. He came to a meeting at the Science Fantasy Club in, I believe it was 19, early 30, 38 or 39.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.860
He had just written his first story and sold it to astounding science fiction.

03:02.420 --> 03:06.700
So he was a beginner, just as I was, except he was about 11 years older.

03:06.780 --> 03:11.080
He was around, I would say, 31, and I think I was 19 when I met him.

03:11.080 --> 03:21.900
So it was that kind of situation where you had personal contact with writers who were already established or were establishing themselves.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.740
And of course it changed my life forever because I had acceptance.

03:26.300 --> 03:31.260
People were willing to put up with me and read my terrible stories.

03:32.820 --> 03:37.920
Though Bradbury did get encouragement from these other writers, his fiction has always been uniquely his own.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.080
We asked him if it would be fair to call him a self-taught writer.

03:41.740 --> 03:43.600
Well, I guess you can say that.

03:44.600 --> 03:52.300
Most writing, almost every art form, is self-teaching, except what you need around the edges is shortcuts.

03:52.600 --> 04:02.920
If people can help you by recommending certain books, either books on writing or books which give you examples of excellent writing.

04:02.920 --> 04:08.260
I remember Henry Kutner was always calling Lee Brackett up or calling me up and saying,

04:08.300 --> 04:12.240
Hey, have you read Captain Adam Porter? Do you know the work of John Collier?

04:12.940 --> 04:14.340
What about Yudor Welty?

04:14.680 --> 04:23.880
Well, this kind of shortcut is so important that you break away from your own field and move on out into the wide culture

04:23.880 --> 04:33.840
and bring back into the science fiction and the fantasy field influences from people like Kipling or a Somerset mom or John Collier.

04:34.480 --> 04:39.100
So that's where having a good teacher is important.

04:39.960 --> 04:52.620
Not that they teach you all that much or that intensely, but the fact that they care about you at all is very good for your sense of malnutrition.

04:52.620 --> 04:57.880
We all feel as if we have set ourselves well enough from here at that age.

04:59.380 --> 05:02.360
We'll continue our conversation with Ray Bradbury next time.

05:09.540 --> 05:19.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.580
So stay with us.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.280
This is David Carson.

06:35.540 --> 06:36.240
And Daryl Lane.

06:36.580 --> 06:41.820
Ray Bradbury is an internationally known author who's managed to attract readers outside the field of science fiction and fantasy.

06:42.240 --> 06:47.560
In fact, he's one of the few writers of science fiction and fantasy whose name is almost instantly recognizable outside the field.

06:48.040 --> 06:53.560
He's also written so-called mainstream, or regular fiction, ever since he began publishing early in the 1940s.

06:53.840 --> 07:00.120
Dandelion Wine, a poetic novel about a boy growing up in a small Midwestern town, is one example of his non-science fiction output.

07:00.120 --> 07:07.380
We asked him how he broke out of the restricted field of science fiction and gained such widespread acceptance for all of his fiction with all types of readers.

07:08.820 --> 07:12.280
Well, you just automatically think about it for a lifetime.

07:12.660 --> 07:21.520
I always dreamt of being, you know, number one, a writer, not a writer of science fiction or a writer of fantasy, but a writer period.

07:21.520 --> 07:32.840
I had huge heroes that I looked up to in the world, people like Shakespeare and a lot of the great poets, Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost, when I was in 19th.

07:33.340 --> 07:39.900
And then as I got older and began to see the world of the theater around me more, I wanted to do theater work.

07:40.380 --> 07:44.800
I loved motion pictures, though, and knew that eventually I wanted to do some films.

07:44.800 --> 07:52.940
So my interests were always very Catholic, very broad, and it was only a matter of time before I would experiment with each of these things.

07:53.400 --> 08:10.840
And at the same time I was writing and having my first success in selling stories to Weirdtales, I was beginning to write short stories in the larger fields, stories about racial relationships or stories about travel inside America.

08:10.840 --> 08:14.420
A little bit of everything I was experimenting with.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.940
Bradbury said he was about 25 when he first began publishing stories that were not science fiction or fantasy.

08:20.880 --> 08:28.840
A friend of mine called me on the phone and said he was going to Mexico to travel for two months. Did I want to come along?

08:28.980 --> 08:36.840
Well, I said, I can't. I don't have any money. I was still only making around $20 a week selling stories to Weirdtales.

08:36.840 --> 08:44.600
I usually sold six stories to Weirdtales every year, which gave me around $120 for the whole year.

08:45.420 --> 08:49.600
And then I sold an occasional murder mystery and a few science fiction stories.

08:49.720 --> 08:54.780
So my income at the time was around $2,500 a year if I was lucky.

08:55.860 --> 09:03.420
And he said, oh, you're such a coward. He said, here the war is over. War has been over in Europe a month or so.

09:04.140 --> 09:10.040
You should travel and you're afraid to send out your short stories. You're afraid of being rejected.

09:10.620 --> 09:18.100
I know you've got a lot of excellent broad literary, middle stream fictions.

09:18.620 --> 09:25.080
I'm not sure we type them and send them out. So by God, he egged me on and I got three short stories out of my files.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.020
I retype them, put an assumed name on each one, William Elliott.

09:29.660 --> 09:38.420
I mailed them off without an agent, without any representation, with not even a letter from myself to the editors.

09:38.860 --> 09:44.040
And one story to Charm, one story to Mademoiselle, and another one to Collier's.

09:44.940 --> 09:48.660
Bradbury got a big surprise and a big paycheck after sending those three stories in.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.760
Well, all three stories sold within three days of each other.

09:53.120 --> 10:04.940
One story sold on August 19th to Charm, on the 20th, one to Mademoiselle, and on my birthday, the 22nd of August, I sold my first short story to Collier's.

10:05.240 --> 10:10.460
So all of a sudden, I had an aggregate of $1,000 which arrived in the mail.

10:10.460 --> 10:21.960
Well, $1,000 back in 1945 would be like getting $15,000 in the mail today. I was out of my head. I couldn't believe it.

10:22.380 --> 10:30.900
So without money, I picked up and went to Mexico with him for six weeks where I had a whole series of adventures that scared the hell out of me

10:30.900 --> 10:35.320
and caused me to write some of my best weird stories when I came home.

10:35.320 --> 10:42.220
So that's the way I made the transition because someone called me a coward and dared me to send my stories out.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.500
On our next show, we'll have more with Ray Bradbury.

10:53.360 --> 11:02.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:05.320 --> 11:35.300
The show is a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:44.600 --> 11:48.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:04.680 --> 12:10.080
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.480
And here are your hosts.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.040
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane.

12:21.340 --> 12:25.640
Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is one of the best known science fiction books produced in this country.

12:26.220 --> 12:34.920
It's poetic style, it's treatment of mankind's present problems, and its vision of man's future make it a book admired not only by regular readers of science fiction, but by anyone who reads it all.

12:34.920 --> 12:39.700
The book is really a collection of related short stories concerning man's colonization of Mars.

12:40.180 --> 12:43.440
We asked Bradbury if he wrote each story with the entire volume in mind.

12:44.640 --> 12:52.140
No, I didn't know what I was doing. That's the best way to do things. Just do them and then wake up some morning and discover you've got a book.

12:52.140 --> 13:05.900
I went to New York City in June of 1949. My wife was pregnant with our first child. We had about $80 in the bank and I took the Greyhound Bus to New York and I took all my short stories with me.

13:06.340 --> 13:13.920
Oh, 80 or 90, 100 short stories, hoping to sell one or two collections of stories to some publisher.

13:13.920 --> 13:24.080
Well, I had meetings with various people at Simon & Schuster in Doubleday and they all said, look, we don't publish short stories. Nobody buys them. Nobody cares.

13:24.720 --> 13:33.780
And then one night I had dinner with Walter Bradbury at Doubleday. No relation to me. Wonderful gentleman, very bright gentleman.

13:34.520 --> 13:43.140
And sitting there at dinner tonight, he said, Ray, what about all those Martian stories? Isn't there a novel there? Isn't there some way of hanging them all together?

13:43.380 --> 13:54.900
It seems to me there's a common thread. I said, oh my God, you know, years ago I made notes about doing a series of chronicles and then threw the notes somewhere and forgot about them.

13:54.900 --> 14:18.240
So my subconscious must have remembered in the long two years was putting these beads on a single thread. I went back to the YMCA that night, sat in my underwear with a hot, hot summer evening terribly humid, and finished typing out an outline of a book which I called The Martian Chronicles, which I then took to Doubleday the next day.

14:18.240 --> 14:31.260
And they promptly bought the novel, plus the illustrated man, a collection of stories. And I left New York City with, again, a fabulous $1,000, $500 for each book.

14:32.180 --> 14:38.080
The stories are not scientifically accurate. Man can breathe the Martian atmosphere unaided, for example, but they're not meant to be.

14:38.440 --> 14:43.660
They have to be read symbolically at a deep unconscious level which is triggered by Bradbury's poetic way of writing.

14:43.660 --> 14:52.220
There is an order to the 26 stories that make up The Martian Chronicles. The final one is entitled The Million-Year Picnic, and we asked Bradbury why he put that one last.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.700
It seemed a proper place to put it. It seemed a culmination of all the stories.

14:59.700 --> 15:12.740
And my job in looking at all my stories was to guess where to place each, and well, some of them it was very easy. I did a whole series of stories of first encounters on Mars with various expeditions.

15:13.200 --> 15:22.800
So I knew those automatically had to be up front, along with an imaginary encounter in Illa where a woman dreams an invasion of Mars.

15:22.800 --> 15:32.060
We never see the invasion itself of the Earthmen, but we know that secretly it must be there somewhere and that real people got killed by the jealous husband.

15:32.620 --> 15:44.360
And then you go along through all the other encounters and what happens to Mars as a result of the invasion by Earth people, and ending with all of your final beats.

15:44.900 --> 15:51.860
And a brief return to Earth where there will come soft rains, and then The Million-Year Picnic at the end.

15:51.860 --> 15:58.700
It all stalled together in roughly two hours in my head at the typewriter that night at the YMCA.

16:00.040 --> 16:06.760
In 1980, NBC produced a major six-hour dramatization of the Martian Chronicles. We asked Bradbury if he was happy with it.

16:08.040 --> 16:15.840
I most certainly was not. It was one of the most boring shows ever put on television. And it's a great shame.

16:16.100 --> 16:33.080
Obviously no one enjoyed doing it, and the director obviously didn't enjoy it, which is a great shame, because he should have got out of bed every morning and said, let's have a ball, let's play, let's jump up and down and scream and yell and get something out of this material.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.220
But he obviously didn't do that.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.120
We'll have more for a Bradbury on our next show.

16:45.400 --> 16:54.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:03.080 --> 17:33.060
The show is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, and it's a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science Fiction, which is a production of the film, The Science F

18:02.460 --> 18:03.040
An advent of whoever wanted in my life,

18:05.360 --> 18:06.840
And here are your hosts.

18:11.140 --> 18:12.300
This is Daryl Aime.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.180
And David Carson.

18:13.660 --> 18:18.300
Ray Bradbury's 1962 novel, Something Wicked This Way Comes, is a classic of fantasy and

18:18.300 --> 18:18.560
horror.

18:19.080 --> 18:23.340
It's about a carnival that comes to a small midwestern town, a carnival with evil secrets

18:23.340 --> 18:27.080
beneath its colorful exterior, and about two boys who discover the evil.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.480
We asked Bradbury if there was a particular impetus behind the story.

18:31.360 --> 18:31.980
Not really.

18:32.220 --> 18:33.660
It all started a long time ago.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.280
I wrote a short story for weird tales called The Black Ferris.

18:38.320 --> 18:43.500
And I've always been in love with carnivals and circuses and illustrated men and wars

18:43.500 --> 18:46.560
and pygmies and you name it.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.400
So over the years all this material accumulated.

18:50.660 --> 18:58.040
And one night about 24 years ago, Gene Kelly invited me over to MGM Studios here to see

18:58.040 --> 19:00.420
a new film of his called Invitation to the Dance.

19:00.620 --> 19:09.180
And part of that film is a sort of dance ballet concerned with a clown, a carnival, sort of

19:09.180 --> 19:14.640
material that Lon Cheney Sr. once did 60 years ago in American films.

19:14.820 --> 19:25.320
He did a lot of films about circuses and armless, legless performers, all kinds of grotesques

19:25.320 --> 19:28.720
that he worked with and pretended to imitate.

19:29.280 --> 19:36.320
So I came out of the screening of Gene Kelly's film and walked home with my wife, lamenting

19:36.320 --> 19:40.660
all the way the fact that I'd never worked for Kelly and wanting very much to do so.

19:41.140 --> 19:46.820
So I got home and I rummaged through all my material to find something to send to Gene Kelly.

19:47.100 --> 19:55.260
And I found The Black Ferris and I took several weeks to write it into a longer 70 page screen

19:55.260 --> 20:01.280
and I had a screening adaptation, a treatment, a heartline, and I took it to Kelly and he

20:01.280 --> 20:03.940
immediately said, my God, I must direct this.

20:04.480 --> 20:08.160
Can I have an option on it and I'll take it to Europe and try to get some money?

20:08.720 --> 20:13.600
He went to Europe for a number of weeks and months and finally returned and said it's no use.

20:13.740 --> 20:15.760
Nobody wants to put up any money for this.

20:16.220 --> 20:18.380
Thanks very much and so long.

20:19.120 --> 20:23.720
Well I was heartbroken because I wanted to work for Kelly and I said to heck with it.

20:23.720 --> 20:30.820
I sat down and I wrote the long screen treatment into a novel, took me about two years, and the

20:30.820 --> 20:37.160
novel was published in the late summer of 1962, twenty years ago.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.520
The novel is a good example of Bradbury's beautifully poetic style.

20:41.820 --> 20:46.200
It uses images of autumn and the gaudy colors of a carnival to convey hidden menace and evil.

20:46.700 --> 20:51.460
The carnival rides, for instance, do strange things to people and the sideshow freaks and grotesques

20:51.460 --> 20:53.100
have unnatural horrifying powers.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.380
Bradbury often uses carnival material as a symbol of evil.

20:56.660 --> 20:57.380
We asked him why.

20:59.080 --> 21:03.240
I think most of us are uncomfortable around carnivals and circuses.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.540
You sense that the people who run them are evil people.

21:06.740 --> 21:10.260
There is something wrong with most carnival people.

21:11.080 --> 21:13.880
The workers, it's a very tough life.

21:14.180 --> 21:15.420
It's a rough existence.

21:17.120 --> 21:24.240
It's run by a bunch of tramps and vagabonds and people who go from town to town, they have no roots.

21:26.020 --> 21:31.120
I should imagine there's a lot that goes on beyond the behind the scenes that you can't even guess at.

21:32.160 --> 21:38.540
Not that there isn't a hierarchy there, in a big circus of course there is, and the people at the top of the hierarchy

21:38.540 --> 21:39.800
are the trapeze people.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.760
They are the royal family.

21:42.260 --> 21:48.140
And then you go downwards through the various levels of performers, depending on their athletic powers.

21:48.340 --> 21:55.820
But it's a very difficult life and it's a miracle if most of these people make it through and keep their sanity.

21:56.400 --> 22:03.960
So when you're a child, you sense, especially in the seedy little carnivals that come to visit your hometown,

22:03.960 --> 22:15.660
you sense the uneasiness, the sly life, the sense of evil behind the scenes in these people.

22:16.020 --> 22:20.760
I suppose that's where my, my fictions came from.

22:21.540 --> 22:27.340
Something wicked this way comes is being made into a major motion picture by Disney Studios and should be out at the end of the year.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.000
We'll continue next time with the works of Ray Bradbury.

22:37.720 --> 22:43.300
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:43.560 --> 22:46.520
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:29.300 --> 23:33.220
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us!

23:49.260 --> 23:54.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.060
And here are your hosts.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.740
This is David Carson.

24:05.000 --> 24:05.720
And Daryl Lane.

24:06.040 --> 24:09.120
One of Ray Bradbury's classic novels is Fahrenheit 451.

24:09.620 --> 24:15.500
It's a chilling picture of a future society in which books are outlawed and humans are weakened by addiction to a totally electronic society.

24:16.280 --> 24:24.380
A person who possesses a book is subject to severe punishment and there's even a government institution composed of firemen whose job it is to seek out all books and burn them.

24:24.380 --> 24:29.600
We asked Bradbury if there was a particular episode or inspiration behind Fahrenheit 451.

24:30.940 --> 24:37.240
It was a combination of things. I had gotten interested with book burners over a period of time.

24:38.880 --> 24:44.820
And when I wrote the book, it was the beginning of the McCarthy era, the Joseph McCarthy period.

24:45.280 --> 24:51.540
When there was a lot of talk about books being banned, not many of them got banned, thank God.

24:52.140 --> 25:00.900
For a brief moment there, I think they took a few American books off of foreign library shelves in army libraries.

25:01.160 --> 25:07.980
And then President Eisenhower ordered them all put back on, which proved what a bright man he was, thank goodness.

25:07.980 --> 25:18.040
But it was during that period that I suppose my subconscious permitted on all this and said,

25:18.100 --> 25:31.360
I've got to do a book about my anger about libraries because libraries is really the place where I was born and raised myself, grew up and have lived for a lifetime.

25:31.360 --> 25:39.920
They really are very super special to me. And I go in bookstores constantly. I can't stay away from them.

25:40.040 --> 25:46.760
I buy too many books. I'm compulsive about it. So the novel wrote itself in nine days.

25:47.120 --> 25:59.940
I went up to UCLA in 1950 and I spent nine days there in the typing room in the basement of the UCLA library

25:59.940 --> 26:06.760
with about 12 students sitting around me and I played these dime a half hour typewriter machines.

26:07.260 --> 26:14.500
And I typed the novel on those dime machines and I spent around $9.40 typing the novel.

26:14.900 --> 26:19.600
So it's a grand place to write a book like that, isn't it, in the basement of a library.

26:20.760 --> 26:24.660
Bradbury seems to be pointing out the dangers of a technological society in the novel,

26:24.880 --> 26:28.980
and some of his other work, like the Martian Chronicles, has some of the same warnings.

26:28.980 --> 26:31.820
We asked him if his work is anti-technological.

26:32.980 --> 26:40.520
Well, that's a misinterpretation. It's never been true. I've never mistrusted technology as only people.

26:40.740 --> 26:44.940
There's a big difference there. It's the way we use the automobile, for instance.

26:45.140 --> 26:50.160
There's nothing wrong with cars that having more safe drivers won't change.

26:50.920 --> 26:59.560
Now, when it comes to computers, space travel, IBM's electric typewriters, these are all beautiful.

26:59.760 --> 27:05.660
We're using them well and the future is very exciting because of it.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.560
Now, I've tried to pick those technologies that I criticized.

27:10.260 --> 27:17.260
For instance, there was a certain moment in history in Los Angeles where they were threatening to put MUSE Act

27:17.260 --> 27:19.000
on our buses with advertising.

27:20.820 --> 27:25.820
And I immediately mounted a campaign with some friends, thousands of people, who said,

27:25.920 --> 27:29.580
oh, no, you don't. Bad enough we have all these posters all over the place.

27:29.760 --> 27:34.100
But to trap us on buses, then make us listen to music we don't want to hear,

27:34.420 --> 27:36.760
or advertisements we don't want to hear.

27:37.240 --> 27:44.500
So I'm anti the way that particular technology was going to be used.

27:45.400 --> 27:49.280
We asked Bradbury if he thought there was any danger of book burning or censorship today.

27:50.200 --> 27:54.860
We hear those rumors every year. And there are always some stupid librarians,

27:55.240 --> 28:01.660
some stupid mayor, or some dumb pressure group in some town somewhere in our country

28:01.660 --> 28:06.480
every year for the last 60 years that wants to censor this or censor that.

28:06.600 --> 28:11.320
And then they blow away. They're just chaff in the wind. And don't pay any attention to them.

28:11.320 --> 28:16.680
And they think, oh, giant size, call me on the phone. I'll come over and kick them in the kishkos.

28:25.200 --> 28:31.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

28:31.000 --> 28:34.200
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.780
