00:01.680 --> 00:02.680
Tapes on the air.

00:02.840 --> 00:03.340
Tapes on the air.

00:03.660 --> 00:06.880
Okay, Lee, I'll ask you first of all, just give us a little bit about your background

00:06.880 --> 00:11.160
and why, what in your background might have led you to write science fiction?

00:12.020 --> 00:12.420
Okay.

00:14.340 --> 00:22.480
Well, I've been writing since I was about 11 or 12, you know, writing all sorts of things,

00:23.700 --> 00:27.680
mostly adolescent sort of things when I was a kid.

00:27.680 --> 00:34.380
But when I was in high school, I started reading science fiction.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.680
It was just sort of natural to go from reading it to writing it.

00:38.260 --> 00:40.140
Most people can't help themselves.

00:40.900 --> 00:45.240
They have any inclination toward writing, you know, and they read science fiction.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.620
They'll usually try and write it.

00:50.900 --> 00:51.580
Were you interested?

00:51.940 --> 00:54.400
You were, what interested you about science fiction?

00:54.680 --> 00:55.560
Was it the, or fantasy?

00:55.560 --> 01:00.540
Was it the hardware or just the sense of wonder, quote unquote, that sort of thing?

01:03.700 --> 01:05.540
Well, I don't know, it's hard to say.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.000
I was older than most people.

01:07.120 --> 01:12.120
Most people start reading it when they're seven or 12 or something like that.

01:14.340 --> 01:22.100
So I suppose I should have had a good reason being 17 instead of seven, but I don't, it

01:22.100 --> 01:24.740
was just, it just appealed to me.

01:24.740 --> 01:30.400
You know, I always liked fairy tales and fantasy kind of things.

01:30.760 --> 01:37.300
And of course I read those things, the books you don't think of as science fiction before.

01:38.140 --> 01:44.280
I actually started reading science fiction like 1984 and I enjoyed those.

01:44.680 --> 01:52.020
It just, you know, I have pretty eclectic taste and it was just one of the things I like to read.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.460
Okay, if I remember right from your background, you have a degree in history.

01:58.360 --> 02:04.200
Was that, does history and interest in history and maybe an interest in fantasy go hand in

02:04.200 --> 02:05.820
hand and has that helped you in your writing?

02:06.480 --> 02:09.680
That kind of, oh yeah, yeah, I think it does.

02:09.900 --> 02:21.900
I think in fantasy and looking at what has happened, you can sort of extrapolate to what

02:21.900 --> 02:22.600
might happen.

02:22.980 --> 02:27.840
You know, I think it's good to be able to look both ways when you're interested in science

02:27.840 --> 02:29.540
fiction, you know.

02:30.740 --> 02:35.880
Did you, you seem, your story so far indicate that you're more interested in science fiction

02:35.880 --> 02:36.840
than fantasy.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.280
Is that a marketing choice or is that where you're particular on this slide?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.440
That's, yeah, that's my interest.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.020
I can't seem to write for markets.

02:46.020 --> 02:53.860
If I could, I would be writing a lot more and selling, you know.

02:59.600 --> 03:05.500
Yeah, but I pretty much write what I'm interested in.

03:05.660 --> 03:12.740
I don't think about, but I'd like to think that what I'm writing will sell, but I don't

03:13.340 --> 03:16.900
aim it toward a particular magazine or market.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.020
Are you a full-time writer?

03:20.540 --> 03:20.780
No.

03:21.380 --> 03:25.580
You support your reading habit some other way.

03:25.780 --> 03:29.900
Yeah, I work at the Austin Community College as a typist.

03:30.220 --> 03:30.620
Okay.

03:30.900 --> 03:31.060
Yeah.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.760
So you can't have it launched out?

03:34.260 --> 03:34.840
No.

03:35.080 --> 03:35.440
Okay.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.720
All right, when I read your stories and I am, I'm not an English professor.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.720
The other guy who's not here as an English professor, I'm a chemist, so I see things

03:45.720 --> 03:47.980
a little different, but I like to look at the literary aspects.

03:48.220 --> 03:57.360
One unifying thing that I saw in your stories seemed to be communication and mainly misunderstandings

03:57.360 --> 04:04.400
between people and misunderstandings between people and people and people and aliens and

04:04.400 --> 04:08.320
they get themselves in situations where all they had to do was just understand each other

04:08.320 --> 04:08.880
a little bit.

04:08.880 --> 04:13.580
Is that something conscious that you are trying to show or is that a theme?

04:15.320 --> 04:15.960
No.

04:16.320 --> 04:23.240
That's the first time I've ever thought about a common theme in my writing, but I suppose

04:26.280 --> 04:27.260
that's true.

04:27.920 --> 04:37.340
It's probably, everybody has sort of an obsession and I think, it's not an obsession, but it's

04:37.340 --> 04:38.480
an important thing for me.

04:39.740 --> 04:47.800
I'm a fairly social person and I like to communicate and that's why I write and so communication

04:47.800 --> 04:51.200
is important.

04:53.120 --> 04:53.580
Okay.

04:53.760 --> 04:59.560
The first four stories that you wrote, well, okay, I can scratch that.

05:00.380 --> 05:05.200
Another thing that's common to me and I read them all, you wrote them over a number of years.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.980
I read them all in an afternoon, I'm saving them.

05:09.780 --> 05:15.340
Another thing that seems to be universally in your stories is power struggles.

05:15.880 --> 05:21.560
You've got a power struggle between two sets of people or individuals or people in institutions.

05:22.480 --> 05:22.980
That sort of thing.

05:23.220 --> 05:27.240
Is that something that you consciously do or is that?

05:27.780 --> 05:28.240
Do you have money?

05:28.920 --> 05:29.220
Yeah.

05:29.220 --> 05:36.400
Well, that could be partly from personal experience.

05:37.040 --> 05:46.140
In my adolescence, I had to deal with some institutions and I wasn't raised in orphanage

05:46.140 --> 05:50.820
or anything, but there were institutions that affected my personal life and I didn't like

05:50.820 --> 05:51.060
it.

05:51.360 --> 06:01.480
And also, I grew up in the 60s and I think we tend to pick up things like that in these

06:01.480 --> 06:11.520
certain years and it's hard to shake those values and I think one of the things is, you

06:11.520 --> 06:19.060
know, individuals trying to work against things that they don't think are right in institutions

06:19.060 --> 06:25.900
and people having to struggle against big powers that they feel they have no control over but

06:25.900 --> 06:28.380
they want to try and they have to do something.

06:30.840 --> 06:36.960
Another thing in your writing style, you concentrate quite a bit on sensory descriptions, how something

06:36.960 --> 06:39.740
feels or tastes or textures.

06:40.540 --> 06:46.120
It's almost like Jack Vance, he's more visual but there's this sensory thing in there that

06:46.120 --> 06:51.660
I like and enjoy that seems that's another trademark that I kind of picked out from reading

06:51.660 --> 06:53.840
your stories in one sitting.

06:53.980 --> 06:57.280
Is that something that you ever thought about before?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.100
No, I don't think so.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.020
That's very nice.

07:00.700 --> 07:04.460
Do you notice things like textures and things like that?

07:04.460 --> 07:05.680
Oh, seem to put them in.

07:06.140 --> 07:06.380
Yeah.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.320
Yeah, I think so.

07:13.280 --> 07:20.320
Yeah, I guess it's hard to compare things like that to other people.

07:20.540 --> 07:26.460
I don't know what other people, if they notice how fabrics feel and how things smell but

07:26.460 --> 07:28.760
I think it's important.

07:29.060 --> 07:33.540
It adds immediacy to a story.

07:33.800 --> 07:38.660
I know I read a lot of fiction where people don't put in sensory details and you feel

07:38.660 --> 07:40.740
like you're sort of floating through somebody's dream.

07:41.480 --> 07:49.320
I know if you smell and taste and touch the world they've created, it makes a lot more

07:49.320 --> 07:49.780
immediate.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.940
I kind of like that feeling of actually being there.

07:56.580 --> 08:02.300
I know there's a lot of people who like dream-like, stream of consciousness fiction but I like

08:02.300 --> 08:03.000
immediate.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.280
Okay, the first four stories.

08:15.440 --> 08:23.920
Helen seemed to break the trend but involved scientists and their work and they were doing

08:23.920 --> 08:24.380
research.

08:25.220 --> 08:30.620
I can think of the people, the oceanographers talking with the whales and the linguistics

08:30.620 --> 08:35.920
person and they do some research and some are doing administration.

08:35.920 --> 08:42.300
You seem to know a lot about research because I do research and you seem to have captured

08:42.300 --> 08:48.460
some of that, the spirit of that, both the spirit of research and the bummer of having

08:48.460 --> 08:50.380
to deal with administrators and that sort of thing.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.360
Have you worked around the research areas?

08:53.800 --> 08:56.480
I guess that's such a big element in the work.

08:56.620 --> 09:03.040
Yeah, well I worked in a hospital for, or in hospitals for 10 years and I think that

09:03.040 --> 09:15.000
gives you an idea of how people have to deal with research and trying to apply things in

09:15.000 --> 09:19.800
administrative hang-ups and stuff like that because you know, sit and listen to the doctors

09:19.800 --> 09:23.860
saying, oh we came up with this wonderful thing but they're not going to let us use

09:23.860 --> 09:24.340
it of course.

09:24.340 --> 09:30.280
But I've never really worked in research.

09:31.420 --> 09:40.520
I guess the hospital is probably the main background.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.840
Okay.

09:43.640 --> 09:44.940
Sure.

09:44.940 --> 09:59.600
I noticed that the idea that I set things in like research labs and I have scientists

09:59.600 --> 10:06.680
doing things, I looked back on my stories like just a few months ago and I realized that

10:06.680 --> 10:15.160
almost every story is like that and it kind of horrified me that I'd done so many of the

10:15.160 --> 10:19.880
same things and I just thought I'm going to not do that as much.

10:20.260 --> 10:27.120
I just finished a story that, you know, same thing, it's like an educated, well a research

10:27.120 --> 10:33.800
institute and I like to think that I was doing something different every time I was writing

10:33.800 --> 10:39.600
and I looked back and I said, wow, look, everything's set in a lab or done by scientists but it's

10:39.600 --> 10:45.120
hard not to do that when you're trying to extrapolate from science and stuff.

10:47.760 --> 10:53.300
Well as somebody who does that and also like science, I don't like hard science fiction

10:53.300 --> 10:59.360
as a rule but very few people actually in science fiction capture what it's like to

10:59.360 --> 10:59.680
do research.

10:59.680 --> 11:06.220
Most of the time it's the genius scientist that probably has a beautiful daughter or

11:06.220 --> 11:06.460
something.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.500
No lab in his basement.

11:08.720 --> 11:13.720
Not everybody, not all of us are geniuses and there's just a lot of hard work in keeping

11:13.720 --> 11:17.400
your nose to the grindstone and screwing around with politics and the administrators and all

11:17.400 --> 11:22.980
that and that's what you seem to have captured and is what interested me because Benford

11:22.980 --> 11:27.980
writes about what scientists are really like, what happens when you really do research but

11:27.980 --> 11:31.800
by and large science fiction although it's science, they don't really treat scientists

11:31.800 --> 11:32.900
as people.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.940
Yeah, they're romantic knights of science.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.000
Or the Darth Vader's of science.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.640
Yeah, it's the opposite.

11:43.880 --> 11:52.100
Okay, I wanted to ask you, okay, the second story that you wrote Whales song was this,

11:52.680 --> 11:54.700
do you have a thing for Whales?

11:55.540 --> 12:01.980
I mean, I do, that's what interested me about it but because they're so big and intelligent

12:01.980 --> 12:04.300
and you're going to get blown away.

12:05.420 --> 12:09.080
Well, yeah, I like Whales, I don't have a thing against them.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.940
And I like their little cousins, the dolphins even.

12:14.940 --> 12:21.660
You know, but actually the story came to me while I was reading about the Eskimos and

12:22.400 --> 12:28.160
I really intended to write the story about the Eskimos more than the Whales but the Whales

12:28.160 --> 12:36.380
of course became the most important thing in the story because it's a symbol of all

12:36.380 --> 12:44.180
sorts of things but somehow the story didn't come out weighted as much toward being a story

12:44.180 --> 12:45.760
about Eskimos as Whales.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.300
I can see that it would be like the Eskimos though, yeah.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.940
In the miscommunication and the generation gap.

12:54.680 --> 13:04.880
I will also would like to ask you to pronounce the fourth story speaking to the tenth and

13:04.880 --> 13:07.360
say how would you say the title?

13:07.880 --> 13:14.660
When I talk about it, I just say speaking to others because I can't remember those

13:14.660 --> 13:15.160
numbers.

13:15.880 --> 13:19.080
I have to look it up every time I write it down.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.720
It's terrible, I don't think I'll ever write a title like that again.

13:25.540 --> 13:29.960
Well, it's a very catchy title so you just say speaking to others, speaking to others,

13:30.400 --> 13:31.820
don't put to the twentieth.

13:31.960 --> 13:32.780
No, no.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.200
So when we refer to that if we can.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.200
You can just say speaking to others.

13:38.940 --> 13:46.140
One thing I know is too and to tail silence, that's actually kind of a space opera, that

13:46.140 --> 13:47.400
sort of thing, it's a love story.

13:48.360 --> 13:58.740
You've got the Cassiopeans, yeah and you also had them in story number four in speaking

13:58.740 --> 14:00.060
to others, speaking to others.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.940
Are you building some kind of known space?

14:03.940 --> 14:04.980
No.

14:05.080 --> 14:05.800
Or consistent?

14:07.060 --> 14:08.960
No, not really.

14:09.300 --> 14:19.800
What for the off-planet stories I've written, I used a book called Habitable Planets for

14:19.800 --> 14:31.780
Man as a reference and I used all the G-type stars within twenty light years and sort of

14:32.640 --> 14:38.360
it turns out it's the same stars all the time because those are the ones that are nearest.

14:40.900 --> 14:45.200
Okay, Helen was a different kind of story from the rest.

14:45.500 --> 14:50.380
It was the first one, the first published one that wasn't in a research library thing

14:51.460 --> 14:54.560
and it's a planet kind of like Colorado.

14:54.860 --> 14:58.780
Was this kind of a homesick ode to the old state?

14:58.780 --> 15:04.400
Well actually I wrote it when I was still living in Colorado and took a while to sell

15:04.400 --> 15:19.600
it but I don't know, I just can't imagine that if people lived on L5s, in a way that

15:19.600 --> 15:25.280
sort of goes back to Salamander too, I can't imagine people living in tin cans and being

15:25.280 --> 15:35.520
happy and I can't imagine that when those, I mean I can see if we do colonize space

15:35.520 --> 15:45.900
like with L5s and such that some of the older ones will be obsolete eventually, you know

15:45.900 --> 15:50.620
the technology will boom.

15:51.720 --> 15:57.220
And so I thought well what would they do with the old ones and why not make them tourist places

15:57.220 --> 16:04.120
and since I grew up in Colorado and I know that there are tourists all over the mountains,

16:04.480 --> 16:10.520
you know I thought well preserve a piece of that up there, you know for people to go to.

16:12.820 --> 16:17.040
The idiosyncratic, that's the right thing that I found out was the Pakistanis.

16:17.040 --> 16:17.680
Yeah.

16:17.720 --> 16:26.120
All things in Pakistan is it and they were quite interesting. Was that a real direct

16:26.120 --> 16:30.080
opposite of the kind of wasp inhabitants? Yeah.

16:30.320 --> 16:35.640
Just to counterpoint their differences. Yeah I like to stick unlikely things in together,

16:36.220 --> 16:44.380
it's fun. That's not that unlikely though, you know it's just something you wouldn't expect.

16:45.260 --> 16:49.460
That's your, is Helen whose face launched 28th kind of Soviet hovercraft year title?

16:50.360 --> 16:53.140
Yeah. Do your titles stick by and large on the short stories?

16:54.260 --> 17:01.100
So far I have a hard time with titles, sometimes I come up with pretty good titles but then they're

17:02.800 --> 17:09.900
titles I don't especially care for. Well Whalesong has been a title of about three different

17:09.900 --> 17:17.920
stories, you know it's sort of a natural like Swan song kind of title and so I kind of regret that

17:17.920 --> 17:23.980
I didn't come up with something that nobody else would have thought of and I think like detailed

17:23.980 --> 17:32.680
silence is sort of a dull title now, now that I look back on it and I kind of but

17:35.620 --> 17:43.260
um yeah that's not one of my, I have a hard time thinking up titles a lot of the times

17:43.260 --> 17:47.280
but Helen I thought of the title first and then the story.

17:50.300 --> 17:56.540
Okay so far you've written short stories and I noticed there's at least one that's coming out

17:56.540 --> 18:02.760
fairly soon. What about a novel? Are you contemplating a novel? Are you a novelist?

18:04.260 --> 18:07.860
Do you have or you're going to have to write a novel so you can write full time?

18:09.300 --> 18:17.940
Well yeah there's no livelihood in writing short stories. I don't have any novels planned.

18:19.200 --> 18:26.400
I wrote two novels when I first started writing science fiction but they're

18:27.120 --> 18:32.840
in my closet and I'm glad I didn't sell them. It'd be embarrassing.

18:35.720 --> 18:44.820
The story I just finished not too long ago, her furry face. I had been planning a novel and I had

18:44.820 --> 18:53.380
this 20 page outline well maybe 15 page outline and I had all these plots and subplots and

18:53.380 --> 19:00.840
it was one day I looked at it and I said oh all that's boring except for this one little bit

19:00.840 --> 19:05.020
you know and I said I'll just write it a short story so I did.

19:05.820 --> 19:08.720
And it's sold. No not yet.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.060
Okay.

19:13.000 --> 19:21.160
Since you do have a real job, a real world job in writing what are your curious what are the

19:21.160 --> 19:24.700
people whom you type for and work with you? What do they think about your writing?

19:24.740 --> 19:27.400
Oh they think it's wonderful. They're proud of me.

19:30.440 --> 19:36.580
Science fiction doesn't have the... When I used to work in the hospital

19:36.580 --> 19:44.940
and I'd first start working or when I first sold a story I'd tell people I sold science fiction

19:44.940 --> 19:52.880
they go oh like Julie thought you were a wonderful person until then. I was like telling people

19:52.880 --> 20:02.520
you wrote true confessions or you know something like that and I noticed after Star Wars it seemed

20:02.520 --> 20:08.560
to make a big difference. People you know say well I also write science fiction. I've sold

20:08.560 --> 20:15.600
some stories and they go oh really wow that's wonderful you know and they're all the people

20:15.600 --> 20:20.220
I work with have always been really proud of me and they you know somebody mentioned science fiction

20:20.220 --> 20:27.440
they say oh our secretary is a science fiction writer. I'm really proud of that. It's funny.

20:29.260 --> 20:34.800
Okay one last question how do you if you had your druthers how would you like for it to work out?

20:34.920 --> 20:38.720
Would you like to get better and better short stories and just be able to to sit and write

20:39.180 --> 20:45.400
or do you kind of like your life? Kind of content with the writing and the real job and that sort

20:45.400 --> 20:55.260
of thing. Oh I would love to write full time you know then hopefully someday you know I don't have

20:55.260 --> 21:02.120
anything against writing novels at all you know I know there's some people that's oh novels you

21:02.120 --> 21:15.980
know short stories are the form but I want to be able to write and make a living at it and I wouldn't

21:15.980 --> 21:22.240
write novels just to make a living you know. I won't write a novel just to make money you know

21:22.240 --> 21:27.500
if I have an idea and I think it'd be a good novel I'll write it until then I guess I'll just have to

21:27.500 --> 21:34.480
type at the college. Sounds good I hope you get to it. I guess the one thing that facing short

21:34.480 --> 21:39.360
story writers is the the number of markets there aren't there are not a whole lot of markets for

21:39.360 --> 21:45.260
short stories. No. I don't think there's got is the economy going to have to change that's what

21:45.260 --> 21:53.400
you can ask about anything. Well during the the depression in the 30s there were more magazines

21:53.400 --> 22:01.720
and more books being published because it was cheap entertainment you know but looks like with

22:02.300 --> 22:07.540
television and stuff like that it's going to be a little different this time if there is a

22:08.620 --> 22:13.600
you know big depression in the economy I don't know if people necessarily turn to the printed

22:13.600 --> 22:21.900
word for you know entertainment. If they read. Yeah. I don't know it

22:23.860 --> 22:32.340
it it it's a sad thing because there isn't really any place for beginning writers to sell their

22:34.700 --> 22:40.220
borderline I mean you know they're almost publishable stuff whereas it used to be

22:40.780 --> 22:47.480
people could get a start I mean not that I want junk to be printed but it's

22:48.500 --> 22:55.080
it's just hard to compete compete and people should have the opportunity I mean everybody's

22:55.080 --> 23:02.240
got to sell a story that they're not proud of to begin with you know very few people start out with

23:03.000 --> 23:09.200
great stories and I think writers need all the encouragement they can get and being

23:09.200 --> 23:17.460
published is the biggest so it's sad that there aren't places for new writers. Okay thank you very

23:17.460 --> 23:18.520
much. You're welcome.
