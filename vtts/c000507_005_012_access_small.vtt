00:01.400 --> 00:03.620
Okay, first of all, yeah, we're going.

00:04.360 --> 00:06.400
Okay, the Science Fiction Writers Association.

00:06.620 --> 00:07.400
Science fiction writers.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.200
Right. Well, America, I'm sorry, Science Fiction Writers America.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.540
I'm going to change that, but that's a while more.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.180
Okay, why did you want the job as president?

00:17.300 --> 00:19.020
Why did I want the job as president?

00:20.400 --> 00:21.120
I don't know.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.140
That's really a hard question to answer.

00:24.320 --> 00:24.740
I don't know why.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.420
Because somebody had to do it, because I thought I was the most qualified person to do it at the time.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.460
Because I've been involved with the organization from the beginning.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.700
I've been vice president. I've been the grievance chairman.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.240
And I've always, from time to time, felt that I was going off in wrong and stupid directions.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.500
And finally, I felt that there were a certain number of things that I could get done in this period,

00:46.500 --> 00:47.880
and that this was a time to do it.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.140
I always felt I would be president of the things sooner or later.

00:51.140 --> 00:53.160
And this just seemed to be the right time to do it.

00:54.100 --> 00:59.260
Jack Williams had been president, and he had dealt with a lot of internal bickering and things like that,

00:59.260 --> 01:00.920
which I wasn't interested in dealing with at all.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.280
I think one of the flaws of the organization had always been that it was too inward looking,

01:04.700 --> 01:06.420
and I wanted to see it more outward looking.

01:06.980 --> 01:09.860
So we had to jack it out with the good deal with organizational stuff.

01:09.980 --> 01:12.560
I felt it was a good time for me to come in and change the emphasis.

01:13.960 --> 01:18.240
Okay, could you just tell me a little bit about what kind of things would you be interested in doing or changing?

01:19.120 --> 01:20.620
Well, I'm not going to mention it.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.380
Well, one thing that I'm already halfway through getting done is the internationalized,

01:26.080 --> 01:29.480
is to have an overseas region with an overseas director on our board of directors.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.180
Because science fiction, writing, and publishing really is an international community,

01:33.600 --> 01:36.100
American writers sell their work all over the world.

01:36.940 --> 01:38.720
English writers sell their work here.

01:38.980 --> 01:43.120
Foreign language writers have different problems, and we're all dealing with the same publishers.

01:43.920 --> 01:48.360
It certainly is an international literature, and it's a spirit of the future and the spirit of internationalism.

01:48.360 --> 01:52.280
So of course I felt it should be an international organization. That's one thing.

01:53.100 --> 01:57.600
Another thing that I want to do when I'm halfway through doing is upgrading the Nebula Awards.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.680
We have moved it out of the World Rec Hotel.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.700
We're moving into a much bigger room in the world,

02:01.780 --> 02:05.200
and we're trying to make it into a more significant event than it has been.

02:05.700 --> 02:09.920
Again, orienting it towards the world at large rather than towards the little in group.

02:11.100 --> 02:14.320
Another thing that I would like to do with it is make it act more like a union.

02:16.660 --> 02:20.600
It has evolved in that direction. We now have a large, complete grievance committee.

02:20.820 --> 02:22.500
We do act like a union in that sense.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.260
Times are getting rough now.

02:25.460 --> 02:30.600
It's time when you need a more militant, skilled, and science fiction writer

02:30.600 --> 02:31.900
that you need in the past few years.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.320
I'm trying to orient it a little bit more in that direction too.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.480
Those are the basic things that I want to do with it.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.400
The ways I want to see it go.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.760
David wanted me to ask you this.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.080
Who would we see? We want to go to WorldCon.

02:47.260 --> 02:48.880
It's going to be in Denver next year.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.800
How does one go about registering for that?

02:51.240 --> 02:53.220
Well, I don't know. This is not on the tape.

02:53.520 --> 02:53.700
No.
