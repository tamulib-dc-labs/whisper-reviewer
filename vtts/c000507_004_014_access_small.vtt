00:11.280 --> 00:18.500
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.500 --> 00:20.720
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.240
This is David Cruz and David Carson.

00:32.100 --> 00:36.700
On this program we will be talking with author Larry Niven. Niven first appeared in

00:36.700 --> 00:43.520
print in 1964 and by 1976 he had won the Hugo Award five times. He has written a set of stories

00:43.520 --> 00:48.560
set in what he calls known space which are a future history or a series of stories with a

00:48.560 --> 00:53.400
common background. He has also written several novels and stories not related to the known

00:53.400 --> 00:58.500
space series. Aside from science fiction, Niven has written a fantasy called The Magic Goes

00:58.500 --> 01:03.320
Away and co-authored with Jerry Pranell, a science fiction rendering of Dante's Inferno

01:03.320 --> 01:08.760
entitled appropriately enough Inferno. Other collaborations with Jerry Pranell include

01:08.760 --> 01:12.340
A Moat in God's Eye and the bestseller Lucifer's Hammer.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.600
For my first question to you Mr. Niven I'd like to ask if you classify yourself as a

01:16.600 --> 01:19.320
hard science fiction writer in the tradition of Hal Clement?

01:19.740 --> 01:26.800
If you've got the class of Jaime that's where I fit yes. I would uh, I suppose all writers

01:26.800 --> 01:36.320
resist classification as best they can. I do other things too. Fantasy, considerable

01:36.320 --> 01:42.640
fantasy, a great deal more hard science fiction, not much in the way of soft science fiction.

01:43.740 --> 01:51.960
Uh, articles, speeches. I'm the guy who did a study of the medical problems of breeding

01:51.960 --> 01:59.100
Kryptonians called Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex and I just published the only venture I've

01:59.100 --> 02:05.320
ever made into economics. A method which would also solve the problem of nuclear waste disposal.

02:05.800 --> 02:12.500
The idea is to turn the nuclear waste into coins. A healthy economy is one in which the

02:12.500 --> 02:18.020
money circulates fast. You mentioned that you had not written much in the area of soft

02:18.020 --> 02:22.680
science fiction. Do you think the new wave is past that fans and writers are turning

02:22.680 --> 02:29.280
back to strongly science oriented stories? Yes I do. However the new wave was very good

02:29.280 --> 02:34.620
to me. When I was first getting started I was the only new hard science fiction writer.

02:34.620 --> 02:44.300
The new wave is a very persuasive thing and very easy to use to justify bad stories. I

02:44.300 --> 02:53.900
think that's what killed it. Not that increased characterization and experiments with typography

02:53.900 --> 03:00.800
and story formats are a bad thing in themselves but it's so easy to use new wave to justify

03:00.800 --> 03:06.760
a bad story. It was bound to go out. How did you begin writing science fiction? Were you

03:06.760 --> 03:13.720
always a science fiction reader? A fan? Yes and personally I found I was making up daydreaming

03:14.340 --> 03:19.640
stories that seemed worth writing. Did you tell the stories to others before you gained

03:19.640 --> 03:25.040
enough confidence to write them down? Yes I've been a storyteller all my life. You have

03:25.040 --> 03:29.880
a large and involved fan following. Do you ever write specifically for them or do you

03:29.880 --> 03:36.700
write only what you want to? I mostly write for myself or an imaginary reader who resembles

03:36.700 --> 03:45.400
me a great deal. Only he needs things explained to him. Beyond that I sell it where I can

03:45.770 --> 03:51.640
and pick up readers where I can. Let's turn to your known space series for a moment. How

03:51.640 --> 03:57.180
did you get started writing a future history? Well there had been future histories around.

03:58.140 --> 04:08.580
Poole Anderson's and Robert Heinlein's and I tell you I guess we each evolved the idea

04:08.580 --> 04:15.200
somewhat independently and the idea is that if you carved out a consistent workable future

04:16.060 --> 04:22.080
it seems a shame to waste it on one story. You put it in the background because you want

04:22.080 --> 04:29.820
the background of a story to seem bigger than it is so there are things that are simply

04:29.820 --> 04:39.560
unexplained. And if you think of more to say on a given subject why you go with it and

04:39.560 --> 04:44.000
if you think of a story that fits into the background of a previous story and allows

04:44.000 --> 04:49.380
you to elaborate on that background, sometimes you fall in love with the background and presently

04:49.380 --> 04:55.100
you've got a bunch of stories that link. In the afterword of Ringworld engineers you said

04:55.100 --> 05:00.980
that your known space series was completed. Is that still true and if so why? I've given

05:00.980 --> 05:08.120
up saying that the known space series is dating. There's just no point in it. I've written

05:08.120 --> 05:15.620
five books for you of known space stories since I said that. And besides that I have

05:15.620 --> 05:21.000
no doubt that I'll come up with stories said in the Gildy Arms Time. I like writing science

05:21.000 --> 05:28.080
fiction detective stories. It's just hard work. I do not have a detective story in my

05:28.080 --> 05:32.420
head. It'll have to emerge. But that's the beginning of known space and I'll continue

05:32.420 --> 05:37.280
to work with it where it looks like fun. You have as you mentioned written science fiction

05:37.280 --> 05:41.780
detective stories and you've experimented with humor and science fiction. Is there any

05:41.780 --> 05:46.120
subject area that you think can't be handled well in the science fiction genre?

05:46.620 --> 05:53.460
No, I can't think of any. I guess I go along with the idea that there are these interlocked

05:53.460 --> 05:59.920
circles to represent areas, areas of fiction and they all swim in the sea of fantasy. Science

05:59.920 --> 06:06.980
fiction probably includes the entire portion of fantasy that is possible and mainstream

06:07.710 --> 06:12.020
would be somewhere in there. Nurse novels would be somewhere in that. There would be

06:12.020 --> 06:16.640
no subject you could treat in English that couldn't be treated in a science fiction format

06:16.640 --> 06:21.400
except fantasy and that would be treated in a fantasy format.

06:22.160 --> 06:26.400
Probably your best known work in the known space series is Ringworld. Can you tell us

06:26.400 --> 06:34.760
how that concept came about? Oh, I ran across the concept Dyson's spear. Dyson, the mathematician

06:34.760 --> 06:42.020
came up with the concept Dyson's shell and he was misunderstood to some extent. So, presently

06:42.020 --> 06:48.900
I ran across an article about Dyson's spear. I picture that as a golf ball 93 million miles

06:48.900 --> 06:56.300
in radius with a sun at the center and gravity generators all around the outside so he would

06:56.300 --> 07:02.500
live on the inside, terraform it with oceans and soil and air.

07:02.500 --> 07:09.980
I ran across that and I didn't like it. I thought it could be improved and I wound up with the

07:09.980 --> 07:15.760
Ringworld. Freeman Dyson in commenting on your adaptation of his idea said that a great

07:15.760 --> 07:19.020
number of small Ringworlds would be better than the large one that you had.

07:19.160 --> 07:25.740
Believe I gave an acceptable answer to that in the Ringworld engineers but in general

07:25.740 --> 07:33.480
he'd be right. It's just that the Ringworld engineers in particular are people who like

07:34.320 --> 07:40.700
dependable weapons of huge size. Many of your fans pointed out a number of mistakes and

07:40.700 --> 07:45.100
made many elaborations on the concept of the Ringworld. Can you tell us what some of them

07:45.100 --> 07:51.140
were and how they were corrected or worked into the sequel? For instance, I suspected

07:51.140 --> 07:57.540
the Ringworld was unstable and I suspected you'd eat attitude jets. I was sure that the

07:57.540 --> 08:02.720
Ringworld was spinning fast enough to permit Leatheramjet to be used as attitude jets which

08:02.720 --> 08:09.260
means you don't have a fuel problem at all. You're burning the solar wind. But rapidly

08:09.260 --> 08:13.880
some MIT people demonstrated that the Ringworld was unstable and they were chanting it in

08:13.880 --> 08:19.680
the halls at the next Worldcon. The Ringworld is unstable. The Ringworld is unstable.

08:21.800 --> 08:28.340
It still took about seven years for anyone to figure out the exact numbers for the instability

08:28.340 --> 08:34.900
and they are horrifying. The Ringworld, a major solar flare would have the Ringworld

08:34.900 --> 08:44.380
grinding against its sun in five years. Well I worked it into a plot. That was one elaboration

08:44.380 --> 08:52.000
or error. Another just can't be correct. It seems that there's too much twilight with

08:52.000 --> 08:57.940
the shadow squares set up the way I have them set up. You get too much of neither day nor

08:57.940 --> 09:05.260
night but twilight half the sun showing, part of the sun showing. The shadow squares ought

09:05.260 --> 09:13.940
to be set up with about five big shadow squares moving in a retrograde world. That way you

09:13.940 --> 09:22.600
get day and night setting much faster when it sets. Terminator line moves like a bat

09:22.600 --> 09:29.880
out of hell. It's still a little fuzzy which doesn't matter. Third point, somebody pointed

09:29.880 --> 09:35.560
out that the tensile strength necessary to hold the Ringworld together is on the order

09:35.560 --> 09:42.740
of the tensile strength of an atomic nucleus. It's the super strong force. Okay, I can live

09:42.740 --> 09:48.480
with that. I can postulate that. I knew this grip would have to be stronger than any normal

09:48.480 --> 09:57.600
material already. Fourth point, some high school class in Florida got to work on the

09:57.600 --> 10:03.340
Ringworld and their conclusion was that the Ringworld's worst problem is that all the

10:03.340 --> 10:08.260
topsoil would wind up in the oceans in about three thousand years. There are no earthquakes

10:08.260 --> 10:17.340
on the Ringworld. No mountain building forces. Okay, that's a tough one. I set up a spillpipe

10:17.340 --> 10:24.700
system that runs the top, that runs the sea bottom from the sea bottoms under the Ringworld

10:24.700 --> 10:35.440
and up over the edge of the Ring, rim wall. That even allows you some mines accumulation

10:35.720 --> 10:49.700
of useful metals. What else? Checking my head. I find Frank Gisperic's suggestion that a

10:49.700 --> 10:55.100
machine building culture on the Ringworld which reached our level wouldn't have any petroleum

10:55.100 --> 11:02.680
products to use. They would wind up using alcohol, of where we use gasoline. And fine,

11:02.680 --> 11:10.760
I can live with that. As a matter of fact, the sludge from making alcohol for automobiles,

11:11.400 --> 11:19.960
the sludge can be used to make plastics, maybe plastic like substances, maybe the chemicals

11:19.960 --> 11:28.080
are just as elaborate as the residues from petroleum. What else? Still checking in my

11:28.080 --> 11:34.300
head. I pick up on other things I can't use such as Dan Alderson's solar system which

11:34.300 --> 11:40.360
involves four Ringworlds. He's got three Ringworlds about the size of mine rotating

11:41.560 --> 11:48.340
orthogonally on frictionless bearings. And the fourth Ringworld is about the size of

11:48.340 --> 11:54.960
the orbit of Jupiter and inhabited by mesplanites. Mesplanites derived from a novel by Hal Clemant

11:54.960 --> 12:05.260
mission of gravity. And mesplanites require cold temperatures about those of the orbit

12:05.260 --> 12:09.660
of Jupiter as opposed to Jupiter which has an internal heat source. Cold temperatures

12:10.260 --> 12:16.180
and heavy gravity. So his fourth Ringworld is the size of the orbit of Jupiter and spinning

12:16.180 --> 12:21.900
like a bat out of hell. I had it figured out that if they spun that Ringworld any faster,

12:21.900 --> 12:29.120
it would get nearer the speed of light and contract. Dan says I've misunderstood relativity,

12:29.700 --> 12:35.800
it would not contract. Okay, I still haven't figured out why not. Well you obviously enjoy

12:35.800 --> 12:40.600
playing the game as how Clemant calls it between your own scientific knowledge and that of

12:40.600 --> 12:45.960
your readers and peers. Absolutely. I incorporated everything that sounded good that I could

12:45.960 --> 12:52.680
use in elaborating the design of the Ringworld. What do you think about the current ideas

12:52.680 --> 13:00.100
for space habitats that are proposed by Gerardo Neal and others? I think they are grandiose

13:00.100 --> 13:05.860
and I certainly wouldn't stop him. But the space program seems to have fallen flat on

13:05.860 --> 13:13.620
its face at this point. We will have trouble reaching the moon again. Getting back to the

13:13.620 --> 13:21.760
moon is as big a problem as we can face. I resent having to say that, but I believe

13:21.760 --> 13:27.240
it's true. Let's turn for a moment to another of your novels, one written with Jerry Pernell,

13:27.780 --> 13:32.640
The Mode in God's Eye. How do you go about constructing an alien like the Moaties? Were

13:32.640 --> 13:39.900
you influenced by anyone in that area? The Moaties were, no, not in that case. In that

13:39.900 --> 13:47.940
case, I had the idea that I was following a progression with a protozoan, with an amoeba.

13:48.520 --> 13:56.940
You get radio symmetry inside and out. Move up a goodly distance and you find starfishes

13:56.940 --> 14:02.140
with radio symmetry on the outside and bilateral symmetry on the inside. Move up a little further

14:02.140 --> 14:09.880
and you find flat worms and worms of all stance. At the level of bilateral symmetry,

14:09.900 --> 14:16.540
inside and out, go as far as a human and you find bilateral symmetry on the outside and

14:16.540 --> 14:24.140
no symmetry, well, half symmetrical on the inside. The lungs look symmetrical, the kidneys

14:24.140 --> 14:30.300
look symmetrical, the intestines look like somebody dropped a plate of spaghetti. I tried

14:30.300 --> 14:39.880
to move on to the next step, bilaterally unsymmetrical on the outside. I got a little bit of a little

14:39.900 --> 14:47.400
bit of the original Modi, which was the engineer for them. But I always design aliens for themselves.

14:47.860 --> 14:56.120
I almost never design an alien to match a story. The story, some story, will eventually

14:56.120 --> 15:01.740
include the alien. The alien stands for itself. I think that one of the outstanding aspects

15:01.740 --> 15:07.140
of the Moaties was their non-use of standardized machines. They would create whatever replacement

15:07.140 --> 15:11.840
parts that they needed on the spot. Do you recall what caused you to think along those

15:11.840 --> 15:20.880
lines for your alien society? I was just playing along. I was just playing with the ideas at

15:20.880 --> 15:27.000
that point and that one seemed like a fun one. It also seemed likely enough if you've got

15:27.000 --> 15:34.280
a critter with not much intelligence except in the direction of tool making and tool altering.

15:35.340 --> 15:43.760
Then why not? The thing has to keep testing its ability or it will lose it. It might as

15:43.760 --> 15:50.780
well be designing something every time it needs a specific machine. The master can always

15:50.780 --> 15:58.560
stop it and have it producing as if by assembly lines. If a master needs a lot of something

15:58.560 --> 16:04.740
it's fast. In Ringworld you developed something called the Teela Brown Gene, humans bred to

16:04.740 --> 16:09.580
be lucky. Was that just a story gimmick or were you extrapolating on the evolution of

16:09.580 --> 16:17.700
humanity? Oh, partly that and partly you've got to remember the time I was writing. I

16:17.700 --> 16:24.720
was damn sick and tired of psychic powers showing up in stories. I did not believe in

16:24.720 --> 16:32.220
psychic powers at that time. I've been told they look pretty good now but at the time

16:33.520 --> 16:40.120
I can see the Teela Brown Gene as being the ultimate psychic power which you may interpret

16:40.120 --> 16:51.060
either as luck or as author control. In that sense it was something of a put on except

16:51.060 --> 16:57.200
that I can believe almost anything while I'm writing the story and I am able to extrapolate.

16:58.600 --> 17:05.280
So if Teela Brown is lucky certain things emerge and if she's just a statistical food

17:05.900 --> 17:10.280
then something else emerges and that's that people will interpret anything that happens

17:10.280 --> 17:17.360
to her as luck, defending her preconception. What do you consider to be your best work

17:17.360 --> 17:24.980
or your favorite work? No, I couldn't tell you that. There is no way I can name a favorite

17:24.980 --> 17:33.520
work. The whole, my career is a progression for one thing. I'd take any novel or any

17:33.520 --> 17:38.780
important short story even out of that progression and it wanders away in a different direction.

17:40.220 --> 17:48.320
So I don't think I have a favorite story but I suppose I can name Incontin Moe which

17:48.320 --> 17:55.460
is virtually the only strictly love story I've ever done. I suppose I can name Lucifer's

17:55.460 --> 18:04.040
Hammer which made me the most money. So a Moe in God's eye may be that. I suppose I can

18:04.040 --> 18:13.480
name old man of steel woman of Kleenex which has gotten me the most laughs I suppose. Everybody

18:13.480 --> 18:23.580
seems to have read it. Moes who haven't heard of out of the cocktail party. Or what? I,

18:23.900 --> 18:30.340
Jerry Pornell and I just recently wrote the last ten minutes for a movie that had a good

18:30.340 --> 18:36.260
90 minutes followed by a bad last ten minutes. The last I've heard is they're not going to

18:36.260 --> 18:40.680
make the movie which is a dirty shame. That is they're not going to make the last ten

18:40.680 --> 18:44.660
minutes our way. They're going to fiddle with what they've got. That's a really dirty

18:44.660 --> 18:51.940
shame. What they've got is garbage. I really hope they use that last ten minutes and if

18:51.940 --> 18:57.140
they do I will get considerable enjoyment out of that and that'll be my favorite. You name

18:57.140 --> 19:02.720
it. You mentioned your collaboration with Jerry Pornell. Which do you prefer, writing

19:02.720 --> 19:09.660
a loan or with another author? I prefer variety. I even prefer variety in my collaborators.

19:10.840 --> 19:18.240
I just finished a novel with a Stephen Barnes and we're starting another. A short one. And

19:18.240 --> 19:27.120
Jerry and I are starting another. A novel about, well we've designed a novel about

19:27.140 --> 19:37.000
a friend, an alien that could invade the earth and also would want to, it's tough to get

19:37.000 --> 19:43.360
an alien whom you could believe would want to invade the earth from another star considering

19:43.360 --> 19:50.560
the distances involved and the energy involved and the penalties for failure and the lack

19:50.560 --> 19:57.040
of the unlikelihood that it will do your home planet any good if you conquer something

19:57.040 --> 20:03.700
that is six light years away. Anyway, we've designed one and we will be writing a novel

20:03.700 --> 20:09.480
about that. When writing in collaboration is it difficult to decide who writes what?

20:10.420 --> 20:18.600
It's hard sometimes but it always resolves. The question is who is most qualified to write

20:18.600 --> 20:24.140
a given scene that we have both decided needs writing. Before we start we have the novel

20:24.140 --> 20:31.000
all laid out. We know what's going in virtually everywhere and if we don't it feels like we

20:31.000 --> 20:37.860
do. And if we find out we don't we elaborate as we get to that section. Okay, the next

20:37.860 --> 20:43.280
question is who is qualified to write a given scene? Sometimes it's obvious. If we're dealing

20:43.280 --> 20:49.900
with a mad man he's mine. If we're dealing with military operations it's Jerry's. Aliens

20:49.900 --> 20:58.160
are generally mine. Politics is generally Jerry's. Knowledge of history generally Jerry's

20:58.520 --> 21:05.780
and a real evil son of a bitch Jerry usually creates him and I usually run with him afterwards

21:06.820 --> 21:15.060
because Jerry has a lot of textbooks on psychology and PhD in psychology for that matter sorry

21:15.060 --> 21:22.820
doctorate psychology and when he's created a really evil son of a bitch he just hates

21:22.820 --> 21:28.060
him too much to work with him. I can easily do something. Horace Berry went that way and

21:28.060 --> 21:35.420
the rapist in Lucifer's hammer and a couple of the characters in Inferno. I understand

21:35.420 --> 21:39.560
that both you and Mr. Pranell use computer word processors. How does that aid in your

21:39.560 --> 21:48.140
writing? It makes first draft a little faster but it makes corrections enormously faster.

21:49.320 --> 21:55.420
You get a more polished novel when I'm using a word processor. It's polishing is just

21:55.420 --> 22:03.540
like thinking into the machine almost. The word processor feels like a magic typewriter.

22:03.740 --> 22:08.540
It does everything you would want a typewriter to do only it can. It can't erase whole blocks

22:08.540 --> 22:12.840
of printed at time and then straighten up the page so it looks like you never made any

22:12.840 --> 22:18.620
corrections but a word processor can do just that and move blocks up and down the page

22:19.920 --> 22:24.400
up and down the manuscript. What do you think Mr. Neumann is the future of science fiction?

22:25.040 --> 22:30.040
Has fantasy begun taking over or is there a lot more hard science fiction to come? Hard

22:30.040 --> 22:38.380
to say. For one thing writers in general don't take orders where the damn science fiction

22:38.540 --> 22:44.360
field is galloping off in all directions just as it always has and the reader will make

22:44.360 --> 22:50.740
the final decision in most cases. What will be successful it will depend on who buys what

22:50.740 --> 22:58.340
books. That's always been true. I understand that some of your works were involved several

22:58.340 --> 23:03.300
years ago with the animated Star Trek series. How did that come about? Oh it went like this.

23:04.960 --> 23:13.680
They were going to start a Star Trek cartoon and the lady who was story editor got me involved.

23:15.660 --> 23:22.360
I tried to give them a story that involved a mini black hole and an outsider ship. I

23:22.360 --> 23:28.300
had the idea that Star Trek had been using many rubber suits for so long that they wouldn't

23:28.300 --> 23:33.500
realize how much more freedom they had with the animated version. That turns out not to

23:33.500 --> 23:40.460
be the case. They had some very good ideas in there. But that story turned out to be a

23:40.460 --> 23:49.120
little over the heads of their intended audience. So I want, it did incidentally wind up as

23:49.520 --> 23:56.960
the first version of the last part of a story called the Border of the Soul. So I eventually

23:56.960 --> 24:03.580
wound up meeting Gene Roddenberry and he wound up suggesting why don't I take a story called

24:03.580 --> 24:11.420
Soft Weapon and turn it into a Star Trek version. And I did that and called it the Slaver Weapon.

24:14.500 --> 24:20.720
And fine they eventually made a cartoon out of it. They also sold the right to turn that

24:21.400 --> 24:29.460
cartoon script into a story. They sold that to Ballantyne. I got mildly upset. The president

24:29.460 --> 24:35.180
of the Civil who was Jerry Brunel at the time got seriously upset and started making as

24:35.180 --> 24:40.940
many waves as he could. And what eventually happened was that they sent me a dollar, a

24:41.460 --> 24:46.260
check for two dollars and something, something cents. Somewhere between two and three dollars.

24:48.160 --> 24:55.280
And Jerry, I don't know where the negotiations went, but Jerry wound up saying, okay that

24:55.280 --> 25:01.820
defends the principle of the thing. We'll ask for more next time. And that's that for

25:01.820 --> 25:06.960
some years. By then I had written to Ballantyne and gotten a letter from Betty Ballantyne

25:06.960 --> 25:13.560
saying, hey we won't ever use it. We promise, we see you're upset. We promise we won't ever

25:13.560 --> 25:20.100
do anything with this. A little later the Ballantyne's got out of the Ballantyne Books

25:20.100 --> 25:27.260
business and into the business of printing illustrated stuff. And Judy Lindell Ray wound

25:27.260 --> 25:36.020
up in charge. And presently I'm being offered two thousand bucks as advisor to Alan Dean

25:36.020 --> 25:43.540
Foster who will turn my script into a novel. And I said fine when I, what I read was that

25:43.560 --> 25:49.000
was acceptable. Two months later I've got a letter from Judy Lind dropping the price

25:49.000 --> 25:56.560
to five hundred and I pulled my top. I said, A, I won't collaborate with you or Alan on

25:56.560 --> 26:01.760
anything of the kind. And B, you may not use anything from known space except what's in

26:01.760 --> 26:08.300
the script. And that is the way it happens. Are there any plans for motion picture or

26:08.300 --> 26:10.800
television adaptations of any of your works in the near future?

26:11.200 --> 26:18.160
Yes there are. I just don't know how far they are going to go. But there is a group that

26:18.160 --> 26:25.580
owns an option on death by ecstasy. And a guy who owns an option on the modian God's

26:25.580 --> 26:35.860
eye. And let's see, I've got a friend trying to get a public broadcasting system to make

26:35.860 --> 26:43.980
a TV version of Lucifer of In Constant Moon. Which would be nice. All of which would be

26:43.980 --> 26:44.260
nice.

26:44.960 --> 26:48.540
Are there any contemporary writers that you particularly enjoy reading?

26:48.860 --> 27:01.360
Yes, a great many. Ursula Le Guin, John Varley, Paul Anderson, Jerry Pornell. How far do we

27:01.360 --> 27:08.000
go with this? I like the old ones and I like the new ones. I like about half of Paul Anderson's

27:08.000 --> 27:15.460
stories, which is a better record than many writers have. I like a few of Bill Dixon's

27:16.080 --> 27:24.700
stories and I will probably buy the last of the Dorsi books by Gordy Dixon. In fact,

27:24.840 --> 27:29.940
it's damn certain I will read it. I'll buy it if it doesn't come free. I swamped in free

27:29.940 --> 27:40.720
books. I'm a Pyrrhus Anthony fan. I don't know how numerous we Pyrrhus Anthony fans

27:40.720 --> 27:47.920
are. I like the puzzles in his books. His books are always jammed with puzzles and new ways

27:47.920 --> 27:50.920
of thinking and so forth.

27:51.440 --> 27:56.500
One last question. I don't suppose those Pearson puppeteers ever snuck you the formula for

27:56.500 --> 27:57.980
the general products, did they?

27:58.420 --> 28:03.840
No, I don't have the formula for the general products though, but I have reason to suspect

28:03.840 --> 28:10.740
that there are puppeteers on Earth. Look at the characteristics. Forget the shape. They

28:10.740 --> 28:16.480
must be masters of biology to hide that peculiar three-legged two-headed shape. But consider

28:16.480 --> 28:24.500
their characteristics. They are cowards. That is, they want everything utterly safe. No corners

28:24.500 --> 28:30.580
on anything. Everything is soft surfaces around the puppeteer world. They don't even keep their

28:30.580 --> 28:38.020
world near a sun regarding it as a runaway fusion reactor, which of course it is. So,

28:38.760 --> 28:46.580
desperate regard for safety, they plus an urge to meddle in the lifestyles of other species,

28:47.600 --> 28:54.860
driving urge to meddle with practically no restraints attached. What does that remind

28:54.860 --> 28:59.240
you of? It seems nearly certain to me that Ralph Nader is a Pearson's puppeteer.

29:07.110 --> 29:08.180
This is David Cruz.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.100
They are laying.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.060
And David Carson.

29:11.080 --> 29:16.340
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science

29:16.340 --> 29:22.580
Fiction Association in conjunction with KOCV FM and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
