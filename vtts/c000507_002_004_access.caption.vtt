coming up next is the science fiction radio show so stay with us

00:28.420 --> 00:33.760
this is the science fiction radio show a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy

00:36.420 --> 00:38.200
and here are your hosts

00:42.820 --> 00:51.660
this is daryl lane and david cruz almost with the publication of her first novel
in 1976 cj cherry became one of the most popular science fiction writers working

00:51.660 --> 01:00.620
today that first novel was gate of ivril cherry added two more books to make it
a trilogy well of shuan and fires of azeroth and for well of shuan she was given

01:00.620 --> 01:09.100
the john w campbell award as the best new writer of the year cherry has
published some 15 novels since 1976 a very quick pace some of her better known

01:09.100 --> 01:18.280
books include the faded sun trilogy brothers of earth down below station the
pride of channer and hunter of worlds in 1978 she won a hugo award for the short

01:18.280 --> 01:27.600
story cassandra we asked cherry if she'd been reading science fiction since
childhood yes i i started reading science fiction i suppose this is about the

01:27.600 --> 01:41.460
earliest form of literature that i read i never made a mental distinction
between science fiction fantasy uh anything of that nature because uh my parents

01:41.460 --> 01:54.540
brought it to me to read and uh i just simply regarded it as the most
interesting the reading material that i had accessible so naturally when i began

01:54.540 --> 02:04.340
turning to writing that's what i wrote she went on to tell us why she decided to
start writing science fiction actually they took my television program off the

02:04.340 --> 02:17.300
air um our television at that time i was 10 television hadn't been around in
private homes very long i had just time enough to get thoroughly addicted to uh

02:17.300 --> 02:28.080
television science fiction and then it ran its course and it was gone from the
air so i in a fit of mourning and went into uh uh the bedroom picked up a tablet

02:28.080 --> 02:36.700
and pencil and started writing my own novels cherry is a talented writer with a
flair for style and structure she might have been successful in any form of

02:36.700 --> 02:45.420
writing she chose to pursue she tells us why she didn't write other kinds of
books well i didn't write the other things because i didn't like them in general

02:45.420 --> 02:57.940
um i find that uh uh i suppose the only thing outside of science fiction that
i've ever tried my hand at writing has been mysteries um and i don't care for

02:57.940 --> 03:10.260
the modern fashion of those and i've always viewed them as a great deal more fun
to read than they are to write um mostly because you have to be extremely

03:10.260 --> 03:24.680
controlled um and i suspect that mystery writers have to know who who did it um
and i'd rather not know the end of my book um the other thing that i've tried my

03:24.680 --> 03:33.940
hand at is historical fiction and i find again that's a straight jacket because
you're rather well held with what happened whether or not it makes artistic

03:33.940 --> 03:45.300
sense so um just for the sheer pleasure of writing i prefer science fiction
donald walheim the owner and editor of da books discovered cherry when she sent

03:45.300 --> 03:57.640
him the manuscript for gate of ivril she explains why she picked walheim i grew
fascinated with um with walheim as an editor because i had gone through my

03:57.640 --> 04:05.860
library finally after seven years of trying to sell things and i thought well
there there must be a system to this you see i had no professional help at all

04:06.740 --> 04:16.340
and um i began searching my library to see what editor had published the
majority of uh works and writers that i liked figuring that we might have

04:16.340 --> 04:30.940
something in common as far as taste goes uh um so i began researching don
walheim to see um um um what his preferences were uh where we differed and where

04:30.940 --> 04:41.820
we were similar and uh so i began to conclude more and more that uh we were
fairly well synthetico when it came to uh to taste uh not quite the same all the

04:41.820 --> 04:51.880
way down the line but uh generally there's a broad area of overlap uh so i found
him very easy to work with we'll have more with cj cherry next time

04:59.440 --> 05:07.320
this has been the science fiction radio show a production of the permian basin
science fiction association produced in conjunction with odessa college in

05:07.320 --> 05:10.440
odessa texas you

05:52.880 --> 05:56.900
coming up next is the science fiction radio show so stay with us

06:12.000 --> 06:17.860
this is the science fiction radio show a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy

06:20.680 --> 06:27.460
and here are your hosts this is

06:27.460 --> 06:36.860
david cruz and daryl lane cj cherry published her first novel gate of ivril in
1976 it was well received cherry quickly built up a following of readers and was

06:36.860 --> 06:44.420
acknowledged as one of the best new writers around the popularity of gate of
ivril was one reason cherry wrote two others on the same subject to form a

06:44.420 --> 06:53.100
trilogy the second book was well as she won and the third fires of azeroth the
trilogy is exciting heroic fantasy that takes place on an alien world there are

06:53.100 --> 07:01.500
two main characters morgaine a beautiful woman who wields a magic sword and
vanya a man who has vowed to help her in a difficult task morgaine's task is to

07:01.500 --> 07:10.880
destroy a space time gate left on vanya's world the gate is a still functioning
artifact left by a vanished race the call the gate can be used to travel in time

07:10.880 --> 07:19.960
or space transporting anyone who enters it to other places and times but the
gate and others like it on other planets is a danger to the universe that sounds

07:19.960 --> 07:27.580
like science fiction but it's not the story occurs on a primitive planet with no
technology vanya and his people regard the gate as an object of magic and

07:27.580 --> 07:36.560
superstitiously avoid it they also consider morgaine as an evil sorceress her
knowledge of technology to them is simply mysterious magic so the novel is

07:36.560 --> 07:44.020
fantasy the fighting is done with swords and transportation is by horse much of
cherry's later writing is straight science fiction with a large amount of hard

07:44.020 --> 07:58.820
science in it we asked her why she started out with fantasy well i didn't um
they weren't the first books that i had written there are others which are uh

07:58.820 --> 08:10.680
tentative efforts that uh that didn't pan out in one way or another everybody
well i i won't say everybody but a majority of writers tend to have them my

08:10.680 --> 08:24.900
first love is really technology the only thing is that i had been out of the
technological mainstream while they had made numerous scientific advances that i

08:24.900 --> 08:37.540
was not current with and it annoys me a great deal to feel that i'm writing
something that is not technically accurate so or that i have glossed over

08:37.540 --> 08:49.900
something it irritates me personally uh to postulate well for instance we have a
gravity field here which keeps everyone's feet on the deck i want to know how it

08:49.900 --> 09:04.120
works so uh consequently i i wrote heroic fantasy while i was uh doing a great
deal of reading in scientific american also heroic fantasy is an area where i

09:04.120 --> 09:16.660
have a good deal of expertise since i have a major in classics history
archaeology anthropology this sort of thing but i'd always been a sort of a

09:16.660 --> 09:25.840
hobbyist in the uh and a little more than a hobbyist since it was one of my
fields in the history of technology throughout the three books we learned very

09:25.840 --> 09:33.800
little about the background of morgaine we asked jerry if perhaps morgaine is a
force or a creature who existed even before the call the builders of the gates

09:33.800 --> 09:43.600
well actually now there's some of this that i i'm not about to give away uh as
regards to the history of morgaine because that it gets into the uh the

09:43.600 --> 09:54.640
possibility of a book that i'm working on at the moment the first set of the
books the gate books involve much more the character of vanya who is a medieval

09:54.640 --> 10:06.220
man i have to take his viewpoint or they cease to be heroic fantasy and they
begin to be a science fiction novel pure and simple because morgaine is far more

10:06.220 --> 10:18.020
technologically sophisticated than he is and if it were told from her viewpoint
it would begin to be a thing of numbers and calculus um morgaine is far more

10:18.020 --> 10:28.700
advanced exactly where she comes from and what she is i've preferred to leave to
the uh to the reader's estimation although i will say that your uh your surmises

10:28.700 --> 10:43.600
are fairly well down the center we'll talk with cj cherry about some of her
other books next time this

Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:02.620 --> 12:07.920
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:10.620 --> 12:12.260
And here are your hosts.

12:16.780 --> 12:25.340
This is Daryl Lane. And David Cruz. C.J. Cherry's 1982 novel, The Pride of
Channer, is a fascinating depiction of alien cultures. Essentially, there's only

12:25.340 --> 12:32.660
one human in the entire book, a wretched man named Tully, who's been picked up
after an accident aboard his spaceship. The aliens who end up with him are

12:32.660 --> 12:39.960
called the Honey. We are with the Honey for the length of the novel, seeing
everything from their alien perspective. The Honey look and act like lions. We

12:39.960 --> 12:56.840
asked Cherry if this was deliberate. Yes, absolutely. This is one case where
I've taken the species of lions and, in a very simple way, devised a culture of

12:56.840 --> 13:09.680
an advanced species, which very closely parallels the biology and, if you will,
social patterns of a lion pride. The title of the book, of course, is a three

13:09.680 --> 13:19.080
-way pun. As an alert reader soon figures out, there is a three-way pun on the
title of Pride of Channer. Pride of lions, the pride characteristic of the Honey

13:19.080 --> 13:26.500
species, and the name of the Honey spaceship, which is called the Pride of
Channer. Tully, the human who falls into Honey hands and gets mixed up in an

13:26.500 --> 13:35.900
interstellar war, is a pitiful creature who both fears and needs the honey.
Cherry explains why he instinctively fears the lion-like species. Have you ever

13:35.900 --> 13:50.840
seen a baboon react to a leopard? It's raw terror. A primate's nervous system is
not really set up to be setting in the center of a pride of lions. It's really

13:50.840 --> 14:00.020
one of the most unkind things, I believe, that you could do to a human being, as
far as social patterns would be, to drop them right into the middle of a feline

14:00.020 --> 14:16.580
culture. Sure, because the moves are all wrong. Well, for instance, Tully, being
a primate, smiles. And, of course, this is exactly the wrong thing to do. You

14:16.580 --> 14:23.620
know what a lion does when it smiles. It's not a friendly gesture. Every gesture
he makes is wrong.

14:26.920 --> 14:40.040
At least as far as he's concerned. In his own way, though, Cherry says, Tully
acts with courage. He is, however, a very heroic human being, if you just simply

14:40.040 --> 14:52.910
analyze what he has done. He has managed to survive a very horrendous situation.
He has managed to collect himself with some dignity out of a situation which

14:52.910 --> 15:05.430
would have broken drastically. Any average individual would have definitely come
out of it damaged. He's been forced to take horrendous decisions, and he's been

15:05.430 --> 15:22.510
dumped into a situation where even his personal value is of some question. And
yet he manages to stand up on his hind feet and confront the honey captain with

15:22.510 --> 15:33.410
a here I am, come and see if you can do something about it kind of attitude,
which is, of course, what wins the captain's respect in the beginning. He calms

15:33.410 --> 15:43.790
down a little bit, as you will see, when he begins trying to deal with them,
doing what any sensible person would do when confronted with a situation where

15:43.790 --> 15:57.370
you suspect that the beings around you are at least essentially friendly, and
there's no need provoking something that would be a total misunderstanding. So

15:57.370 --> 16:11.790
he does remain a little bit quiet, but he's quiet partially because he's smart
and is trying to absorb more data than he gives out. The Pride of Channer is a

16:11.790 --> 16:19.110
typical C.J. Cherry narrative, well plotted with finely drawn alien cultures and
full of exciting and realistic space battles. And that's what we've come to

16:19.110 --> 16:24.370
expect from Cherry. She doesn't seem to know how to write a bad book. More with
C.J. Cherry on our next show.

16:31.670 --> 16:39.450

17:48.450 --> 17:53.710
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.070
And here are your hosts.

18:02.350 --> 18:11.070
This is David Cruz. And Daryl Lane. One of the finest science fiction trilogies
in recent years is C.J. Cherry's Faded Sun series. It was published in the late

18:11.070 --> 18:19.890
1970s under the titles Kesrith, Shongir, and Kutath. There are few books in
science fiction that present an alien culture with the sensitivity and depth

18:19.890 --> 18:28.050
that Cherry has given to one of the alien races in the trilogy, the Mree. The
Mree are nomadic tribesmen of the desert. They are great warriors, and space

18:28.050 --> 18:34.670
-faring races employ them as mercenaries. Cherry says she didn't pattern the
Mree on any modern nomadic cultures, but she used her knowledge of ancient

18:34.670 --> 18:46.730
history. When I did the Faded Sun novels, which are basically a desert culture,
I did not pattern it off any modern desert culture about which I know, frankly,

18:46.970 --> 19:00.910
nothing. I patterned it strictly by taking what I know about desert survival and
earlier nomadic cultures here on Earth,

19:04.130 --> 19:17.870
contrived a biology that would work under the extreme conditions that I
postulated, and then drew elements from here and there. It's very strange that I

19:17.870 --> 19:29.750
now get letters from people that say that it very closely resembles a modern
terrestrial nomadic culture. But this is strictly a surprise to me. I suppose it

19:29.750 --> 19:46.930
just says that I knew something about the very ancient one. We asked Cherry what
she most admired about the Mree. I think that, for one thing, about the Mree, I

19:46.930 --> 20:05.910
think I admire their steadfastness, their ability to face time itself with
tranquility, in the sense that they can take the long view, which is a thing

20:05.910 --> 20:17.250
that is absolutely necessary, in my mind, for civilized survival. In my mind, I
don't say just survival, but civilized survival. It's their ability to look down

20:17.250 --> 20:33.590
the centuries and see consequences. The Mree sense of time is a very strange
thing. A Mree always lives now, and that now is a composite of the past, current

20:33.590 --> 20:47.030
events, and the future simultaneously. They do not view time as the modern
American does, which is more or less a set of beads on the string that we can

20:47.030 --> 20:58.630
snip off any tail of the string that seems inconvenient to us. The Mree concept
of the universe is holistic. The Mree have almost been wiped out, because

20:58.630 --> 21:06.510
they've been used as pawns in an interstellar war between humans and another
alien culture, the Regal. Duncan, a human who's been partly responsible for the

21:06.510 --> 21:14.250
Mree's seemingly certain demise, is conscience-stricken at the possible end of
such a beautiful and ancient culture. His solution is to attempt to become a

21:14.250 --> 21:30.630
Mree, although it may kill him and will certainly destroy his humanity. His
final sacrifice, in a sort of a redemptive sense, is that he finally agrees that

21:30.630 --> 21:43.210
he will no longer attempt to be human, that he begins to try to be something
else. Even in that, there is a considerable hazard, because if the transition is

21:43.210 --> 21:53.890
not complete, he may end up by contaminating the culture, which to the Mree and
their way of life is a very, very serious thing. But it is a voluntary and

21:53.890 --> 21:54.790
conscious decision

21:58.050 --> 22:10.010
that effectively it is personal suicide. And he takes it because he feels
responsible for what has happened. Duncan's attempt to become a Mree is one of

22:10.010 --> 22:15.730
the most sensitive treatments of human-alien contact in science fiction. We'll
have more with C.J. Cherry on our next program.

23:36.010 --> 23:41.170
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:43.970 --> 23:45.510
And here are your hosts.

23:50.110 --> 23:58.510
This is Daryl Lane and David Cruz. Hunter of Worlds, a 1977 novel by C.J.
Cherry, is a different sort of science fiction book, a difficult one that

23:58.510 --> 24:06.150
surprised a few of its readers. Cherry has created a language for one of the
alien cultures in the novel, and the narrative is sprinkled with strange words

24:06.150 --> 24:19.410
that slow a reader down. Cherry admits that Hunter of Worlds is different from
other works. Hunter of Worlds is constructed for different reasons. Usually when

24:19.410 --> 24:30.070
I use alien languages in a book, it is not for local color, it's just that when
you run across anybody's civilization, which is vastly different than your own,

24:30.070 --> 24:40.830
you're going to come across three or four words which cannot be translated, no
matter how you would like to. It's just that not all languages have words for

24:40.830 --> 24:42.650
concepts.

24:45.030 --> 24:54.430
Well, you know, like in English, you can think of several things that you can
say that you can't say in French and vice versa, which is why language borrows

24:54.430 --> 25:05.450
words from other languages. When I did Hunter of Worlds, I was doing something
totally different, and it is an experimental novel, and it is not a novel that I

25:05.450 --> 25:17.350
recommend to someone who is not used to science fiction or not used to language,
one or the other. Basically on that one, the very premise of the book is

25:17.350 --> 25:33.870
linguistics, treating the science of linguistics, as you will, as seriously as
you treat physics in a science fiction novel. I deliberately set out to make a

25:33.870 --> 25:46.510
language which is not based on any earthly model. I even changed the rules of
grammar to something that, as far as I know, is not directly based on any

25:46.510 --> 25:58.490
grammatical system on the face of the earth. The thing is explained in an
appendix in the back for people who wish to do this kind of thing. Cherry has

25:58.490 --> 26:09.530
some advice for those who read the novel. There are several ways to read the
book. The first one, the recommended one, is as the viewpoint character sees it.

26:10.510 --> 26:20.450
Frankly, the viewpoint character is confused as all get out most of the time. He
doesn't understand. So you can equally well appreciate the book simply by

26:20.450 --> 26:31.090
realizing that from his viewpoint, a lot of these people are speaking things at
him which he in no wise comprehends. The trouble with the book is that, of

26:31.090 --> 26:46.330
course, at several points he's vastly mistaken about what he thinks he
understands. So the book does have some pitfalls in it for somebody who is

26:46.330 --> 26:58.210
accustomed to believing everything that the hero in a novel believes must ergo
be the truth because he is very, very frequently mistaken or very, very

26:58.210 --> 27:11.630
frequently picks up a concept which is not the whole concept and gradually
begins to arrive at an understanding of what's going on toward the end of the

27:11.630 --> 27:22.390
book. But I must warn everyone that even at the end he is somewhat mistaken.
Cherry says she has a special affection for the novel.
