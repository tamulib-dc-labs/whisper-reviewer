00:11.820 --> 00:18.320
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today, presented by the

00:18.320 --> 00:20.520
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.680 --> 00:27.040
This is David Crews, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.220
The subject of this show is cataclysms.

00:35.620 --> 00:41.200
This is one of the most long-standing of all science fiction themes, end-of-the-world stories

00:41.200 --> 00:48.440
or catastrophe stories, in which some tremendous disaster destroys civilization, sometimes destroys

00:48.440 --> 00:51.460
all life on the earth, and even occasionally the earth itself.

00:53.040 --> 00:59.940
One of the criterion for today's shows is that the catastrophe actually occurs, so that we'll

00:59.940 --> 01:05.640
be dealing with stories that either describe the cataclysm or the catastrophe itself or

01:05.640 --> 01:09.120
the aftermath of it, not simply the threat.

01:11.320 --> 01:17.600
And mankind has been fascinated with this material for, I suppose, ever since he's been on the

01:17.600 --> 01:19.800
earth, going back even to biblical days.

01:20.760 --> 01:27.120
You could tie in the cataclysms of the flood and the Sumerian legends.

01:27.320 --> 01:33.480
I think even just about every tribal society has some kind of legends of cataclysms to their

01:34.320 --> 01:34.800
habitat.

01:35.940 --> 01:40.260
Probably even Atlantis we could mention as a cataclysm.

01:40.260 --> 01:44.760
That wasn't the end of the world so much, but it's been famous as an end of a civilization,

01:44.760 --> 01:49.080
or at least a legend of the end, and I think it's been found in many pieces of literature

01:49.080 --> 01:49.980
or legends afterwards.

01:52.040 --> 01:57.240
Well, ever since ancient days, we can see authors of all sorts using end-of-the-world stories.

01:59.060 --> 02:04.140
One of the earliest in the modern tradition, I think, would be by Mary Shelley, The Last

02:04.140 --> 02:04.540
Man.

02:05.740 --> 02:10.700
She was the one who wrote the book Frankenstein, which some people consider the first science

02:10.700 --> 02:11.300
fiction novel.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.720
But in 1826, she also wrote a novel called The Last Man.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.420
Literally, there is a last man.

02:18.780 --> 02:22.500
There's been a plague which has destroyed or decimated the entire population of the world,

02:23.110 --> 02:28.360
and there's one man left, and she was examining his psychology, his state of being, and so forth.

02:29.680 --> 02:35.420
Probably one of the most famous of all was Wells' War of the Worlds, which was published

02:35.420 --> 02:36.140
in 1898.

02:37.220 --> 02:43.380
And that is an invasion of Earth by Mars, where the Martians launch projectiles to the Earth,

02:43.420 --> 02:51.660
and when they land, the Martians set up machines which walk about the Earth on a tripod and decimate

02:51.660 --> 02:53.700
the population by use of a heat ray.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.880
Well, they would have been successful, except for one fact.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.140
One of the smallest of our weapons got them, namely our bacteria.

03:04.240 --> 03:09.620
Yeah, there was some germ they weren't immune to, and it simply wiped them out.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.700
Else, we assume they would have succeeded in annihilating the population of the world.

03:15.540 --> 03:22.160
And that story had a tremendous influence on people, especially, say, up in the 30s when

03:22.160 --> 03:27.760
Orson Welles performed his famous radio show on the War of the Worlds, where people actually

03:27.760 --> 03:32.280
thought they were being invaded by aliens, and that their civilization was coming to an end.

03:32.280 --> 03:37.120
I think that shall probably set up the pattern for all the pulp aliens that you got from

03:37.120 --> 03:41.640
that point on for a number of years, the bug-eyed monster.

03:41.920 --> 03:49.880
There have also been many studies on crowd psychology and other types of related studies on why people

03:49.880 --> 03:51.020
reacted the way they did.

03:52.360 --> 03:58.740
Well, also, at that time, say, particularly in the 30s, when Welles did his radio show and so forth,

04:01.060 --> 04:07.300
astronomers had seen and mapped the so-called canals of Mars and the Schiaparelli canals.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.280
And there was speculation that perhaps there was life on Mars.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.940
And there was also a threat of war from Europe, and that really predominated the minds of the

04:15.940 --> 04:16.720
people at the time.

04:16.820 --> 04:25.800
And it wasn't a tremendous jump in the way they thought from a war from Europe to maybe

04:25.800 --> 04:26.800
a war from Mars.

04:27.100 --> 04:32.020
Yeah, it was one of the first times that a concept of a real destruction of the Earth,

04:32.020 --> 04:37.860
or at least of the civilizations on it, became plausible to the people on Earth.

04:39.380 --> 04:47.580
And I think with that awareness, it instigated a whole series of similar subjects in science

04:47.580 --> 04:55.020
fiction, both in books and in movies, throughout the 40s and the 50s, what we tend to call pulp

04:55.020 --> 04:56.420
science fiction now.

04:57.820 --> 05:02.860
Even as far back as the 30s, late 20s, these pulps were dealing with alien invasion.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.480
I think probably one of the most popular cataclysm or catastrophe stories in the pulps was the

05:08.320 --> 05:13.960
alien story, where some tremendously ugly and powerful and malevolent bug-eyed monsters came

05:13.960 --> 05:16.920
to Earth and attempted to take it over.

05:17.460 --> 05:21.640
And probably one of the most popular of those types of stories was Jack Williamson's

05:21.640 --> 05:22.500
The Legion of Space.

05:24.220 --> 05:26.320
These monsters are all set to take over Earth.

05:26.420 --> 05:32.200
And at the last moment, they are averted by the actions of a hero and a heroine in true

05:32.200 --> 05:33.300
space opera fashion.

05:35.600 --> 05:41.940
But it wasn't until, I think, the late 1940s and the early 50s until authors became more

05:41.940 --> 05:43.280
serious with the theme.

05:43.940 --> 05:50.440
And one of the classics of all catastrophe stories is Earth Abides, published in 1949 by

05:50.440 --> 05:51.100
George Stewart.

05:51.100 --> 05:51.760
George Stewart.

05:52.100 --> 05:58.300
And this is one of the few books that both science fiction and mainstream readers take

05:58.300 --> 05:58.940
as a classic.

05:59.260 --> 06:01.060
It was his only science fiction book.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.240
And probably it's one of the best novels.

06:05.180 --> 06:08.500
I would say one of the best novels of our century, period, science fiction or otherwise.

06:10.120 --> 06:15.360
It's a mutated virus that wipes out the population of the Earth or large portions of it.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.000
There are some immune people who survive.

06:19.620 --> 06:24.900
And at first, their conflict is how are they going to rebuild their culture.

06:25.720 --> 06:30.060
In the first place, they can use the remnants of what's there.

06:30.180 --> 06:33.160
The machinery, the food, for instance, supermarkets are still stocked.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.160
A home still have groceries in the freezers and refrigerators.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.100
Most of the machines still work.

06:39.380 --> 06:41.200
So in one sense, they have it pretty easy.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.380
They can use what's there to survive.

06:44.440 --> 06:52.340
But the hero, a person named Isherwood Williams, who's called Ish or Ishi, decides that they

06:52.340 --> 06:53.380
have to build their own culture.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.760
They can't rest on the remnants of his previous one.

06:56.900 --> 07:03.880
So he sort of leads them toward a tribal society where they almost parallel the life and the

07:03.880 --> 07:05.860
culture of the Native American Indians.

07:07.740 --> 07:08.940
And they do survive.

07:08.940 --> 07:09.940
It's a hopeful book.

07:10.040 --> 07:16.600
Ish is successful in leading his group to the values he thinks will allow them to form

07:17.340 --> 07:18.720
a viable future.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.800
And it's an idea book, but it's also an adventure book.

07:24.880 --> 07:25.540
It's fascinating.

07:25.740 --> 07:32.000
And I think probably one of the earliest serious uses of the catastrophe or cataclysm theme.

07:33.660 --> 07:36.400
The cinema has followed much the same trend as the literature.

07:36.400 --> 07:44.480
At first, when they came out with a cataclysm-type epic, it was a world being destroyed by monsters,

07:47.780 --> 07:49.760
generally bug-eyed monsters at that.

07:50.220 --> 07:59.900
But they, in turn, in the early 50s and late 60s, got more sophisticated with movies such as

07:59.900 --> 08:02.400
Seven Days in May and Fail Safe.

08:04.080 --> 08:11.440
One that was particularly effective, I think, is the 50s movie On the Beach from the book

08:11.440 --> 08:12.240
with the same name.

08:13.220 --> 08:16.960
It was particularly effective, I think, because it came at the right time.

08:16.960 --> 08:21.980
It was right when nuclear bombs became a reality in the world.

08:22.540 --> 08:27.040
And all of a sudden, there was this story of total nuclear destruction.

08:27.040 --> 08:35.080
The inhabitants that are left on the planet are searching for other life and searching

08:35.080 --> 08:39.300
for any possible way of maintaining their lives.

08:39.460 --> 08:42.440
But in the entire planet, it's just decimated.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.320
I think the people we center on first in that book and the movie both is the crew of a submarine.

08:48.540 --> 08:51.780
Of course, they've been under the water and weren't subject to the blast.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.260
And I guess the only place left on Earth where there's any kind of life is in Australia.

08:56.540 --> 08:59.360
The clouds, the radioactivity hasn't gotten that far.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.980
So I believe they do find life in Australia.

09:01.980 --> 09:07.180
But it's a kind of a rarity in cataclysm books.

09:08.100 --> 09:13.720
I would say that the majority of catastrophe or cataclysm stories center on the few survivors

09:13.720 --> 09:18.460
trying to survive, finding a way to survive, so that there's some hope or some optimism.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.600
But in this book, there was total pessimism.

09:21.680 --> 09:25.480
All these people were able to do is to find a way to accept death.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.780
It was going to be the end of everything.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.460
You know, there was no way out of it.

09:28.460 --> 09:32.840
And I think it had a tremendous influence on the public, especially the movie.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.760
You know, it was brought home to them what an actual nuclear holocaust could cause.

09:40.480 --> 09:45.480
A book that takes a slightly different tack than that was Alas, Babylon by Pat Frank.

09:46.700 --> 09:51.360
In that particular book, the locale is Florida.

09:51.960 --> 09:56.980
And the protagonist is a civilian who has a brother who's in the military.

09:56.980 --> 10:03.860
And he is forewarned of an international cataclysm brought on by nuclear war.

10:04.320 --> 10:13.520
He's able to make some very preliminary efforts to get some survival gear together and whatever.

10:14.900 --> 10:22.940
When the bomb hits, the community is spared because there are no military installations close by.

10:23.440 --> 10:30.240
Their view of the war is mainly flashes and earth tremors off in the distance.

10:31.380 --> 10:38.360
The community in which he lives in Florida eventually is able to put itself back together and become a working community.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.240
Although drastically changed from what it was before the war.

10:42.540 --> 10:49.980
Many of the people who have illnesses such as Lavena McGovern, a diabetic, dies when her insulin runs out.

10:53.140 --> 10:58.660
One of the biggest shifts in the novel comes when people realize that money is no longer worth anything.

10:59.220 --> 11:05.100
And the society changes from that of purchase from a coined barter type system.

11:05.940 --> 11:07.820
Many people aren't able to cope with this.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.620
And they lock themselves up in their rooms.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.580
They won't come out.

11:12.580 --> 11:15.040
They refuse to face what's happened.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.640
And others simply commit suicide.

11:18.860 --> 11:24.020
They are eventually able to contain their society and let it prosper.

11:24.160 --> 11:28.440
Even though they have tremendous problems along the way.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.200
I think that would be taken as an optimistic cataclysm story.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.100
A good part of civilization does end.

11:36.240 --> 11:42.060
But the book centers on how good beginning can be.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.580
Well, good will triumph over evil.

11:44.940 --> 11:45.460
Basically.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.320
Well, civilization will come back.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.280
Some kind of civilization.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.500
If people are smart enough to do it.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.900
There are two other books around this time.

11:55.220 --> 11:57.480
Which do about the same thing Alas, Babylon does.

11:57.580 --> 11:58.260
But in different ways.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.860
Red Alert in 1958 by Peter George

12:01.860 --> 12:04.380
was made into the movie Dr. Strangelove.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.700
And Level 7 by Mordecai Rochwald in 1960.

12:09.580 --> 12:12.940
And that book did develop the end of civilization.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.880
Button pushers below the surface of the earth.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.480
Sending missiles to destroy everything.

12:19.380 --> 12:23.860
One of the later bomb stories in 1969 was by Norman Spinrad.

12:23.940 --> 12:24.640
The Big Flash.

12:25.520 --> 12:31.020
And of particular interest here is the fact that Spinrad was identified with one of the movements in science fiction.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.000
Called the New Wave.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.740
These people were interested in style.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.120
They were interested in protest.

12:36.540 --> 12:37.020
Rebellion.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.480
Doing things in a different way.

12:39.620 --> 12:44.180
And Spinrad conceived of an ingenious way of ending life.

12:44.220 --> 12:45.880
It was sort of a protest story.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.640
Written around the time of the Vietnam War also.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.040
But he has a rock group called the Four Horsemen.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.980
Which of course symbolically could be the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.700
They are so good.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.120
And they influence the people so heavily.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.320
And all of their work deals with the bomb.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.820
Their music reproduces the sound of an atomic bomb.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.280
Their light shows reproduce one.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.720
And the people become obsessed with the bomb.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.120
The military loves it.

13:14.220 --> 13:19.380
Because they can see in the polls that people are becoming in favor of the bomb.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
They like the group so well.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.440
They're so influential.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.300
That public opinion is going around toward the bomb.

13:25.380 --> 13:25.900
Let's drop it.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.000
So the military.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.100
There's a great deal of irony or sarcasm here.

13:32.480 --> 13:36.300
The military sets up a concert for the Four Horsemen.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.620
Out in the Nevada desert.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.860
With an atomic bomb ready to go off about five miles behind them.

13:41.140 --> 13:43.760
At the moment of crescendo in their performance.

13:44.660 --> 13:47.600
The show is also being shown over television.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.640
The nuclear submarines.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.400
The Polaris people are watching it.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.300
The people in the underground silos are watching it.

13:54.300 --> 13:58.000
And Spinrad brings all this together through a countdown.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.600
A very ingenious stylistic method he uses.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.180
Switching from characters and counting it down.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.280
Until at the moment of crescendo.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.840
Their music reaches the crescendo.

14:06.960 --> 14:07.560
The explosion.

14:07.700 --> 14:08.560
The bomb goes off.

14:08.900 --> 14:12.720
And all the buttons on the Polaris subs and the underground silos are pushed.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.060
By the military people who are obsessed.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.600
Or almost mesmerized by this music.

14:19.120 --> 14:25.900
And the big flash occurs, which is the, we presume the end of civilization because of nuclear holocaust.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.360
Another end of the world story based on nuclear holocaust.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.700
Is Roger Zelazny's Damnation Alley.

14:33.180 --> 14:40.280
In which the United States is attacked by powers from across the sea and we retaliate.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.820
But much of civilization is wiped out by nuclear holocaust.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.140
One of the military installations survives.

14:45.440 --> 14:51.200
And they build a very elaborate all-terrain vehicles and travel across the country.

14:51.200 --> 14:59.240
The country is ravaged by electronic storms and various radiations because the earth has been tilted drastically on its axis.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.040
I think there are also a lot of mutated creatures, huge monsters.

15:05.320 --> 15:10.100
And all sorts of strange demon-like creatures out there that are dangerous besides the radiation.

15:10.100 --> 15:13.980
They eventually make their way across the desert.

15:14.420 --> 15:20.520
And during one of their campouts in a city.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.680
The earth writes itself on its axis.

15:22.940 --> 15:24.120
And the skies clear up.

15:25.060 --> 15:28.800
And on that particularly more lighter part of the book.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.040
They find another monoclave of civilization.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.300
And are reunited with them.

15:32.420 --> 15:33.620
And that's the end of the book.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.560
I think that's a very un-Zelaznyan book.

15:36.940 --> 15:39.180
It's a very strange book for Zelazny to write.

15:39.900 --> 15:43.020
It doesn't seem to reflect his other writings.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.020
It wasn't written for the screen.

15:47.020 --> 15:48.380
Because it was written in 1969.

15:49.060 --> 15:53.060
And the motion picture came out in, I believe, 78.

16:11.020 --> 16:15.300
I think we should also mention Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.800
As a cataclysm type of story.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.040
Or at least some of them.

16:19.500 --> 16:19.920
Yeah.

16:19.920 --> 16:25.220
In the Martian Chronicles, the earth is destroyed by nuclear holocaust.

16:26.440 --> 16:30.820
And one of the main characters back on Mars goes back and tries to save his brother.

16:30.820 --> 16:31.920
But it is unsuccessful.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.220
Because by the time he gets there, everybody has died.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.440
And he returns to Mars.

16:37.860 --> 16:44.420
And this, in turn, makes it so that the people on Mars then become the Martians.

16:45.360 --> 16:50.920
We might mention under this section on the bomb, or cataclysms caused by nuclear warfare.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.580
Again, a classic, A Canticle for Leibowitz, published in 1960.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.180
Walter M. Miller wrote the book.

16:59.260 --> 17:00.840
I think it was his only science fiction book.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.060
But it's fascinating because not only is it a holocaust story, but it's the first,

17:06.060 --> 17:11.920
and probably still the greatest consideration of religion in science fiction.

17:12.780 --> 17:17.360
After the holocaust, almost all of civilization is destroyed.

17:17.990 --> 17:20.820
And a scientist attempts to preserve knowledge.

17:21.080 --> 17:28.560
He wants civilization to be reborn, so he deliberately founds an order of monks to preserve civilization.

17:28.560 --> 17:35.380
And for a long time, after the holocaust, these monks are the only ones who have knowledge.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.820
They preserve knowledge, as the monks in the Middle Ages did.

17:39.180 --> 17:40.520
Hundreds of years pass.

17:40.880 --> 17:44.500
A renaissance comes, just as it did in actual world history.

17:45.620 --> 17:47.860
Knowledge is disseminated among the people.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.300
Civilization rises again.

17:50.040 --> 17:55.300
In the third part of the book, they reach the point where they can again create atomic bombs.

17:55.980 --> 17:57.440
There's another holocaust.

17:58.940 --> 18:03.460
This time, the monks gather their records, their people.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.100
They take a few women, a few children.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.160
They take off on a huge spaceship and go to Centaurus, the star Centaurus,

18:10.180 --> 18:17.860
where we presume they will not be contaminated any further with atomic weapons,

18:17.860 --> 18:19.060
with that kind of civilization.

18:19.740 --> 18:22.320
But it's an incredibly complex book.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.020
That brief summary doesn't do it justice.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.600
It's ultimately an optimistic book.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.200
It has a great deal of religious speculation in it.

18:30.280 --> 18:34.540
And I would say it's one of the great books, not only great science fiction books,

18:34.620 --> 18:35.620
but great books of our culture.

18:36.720 --> 18:42.600
This that you've mentioned in Canticle for Leibowitz brings up a subset of these kind of stories where,

18:42.900 --> 18:50.160
after the Holocaust has occurred, the survivors try to repress science and keep science from occurring again

18:50.160 --> 18:53.620
so that there will be no chance of a recurrence of the bomb.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.180
This has been treated in several stories.

18:57.320 --> 19:01.580
One of them that you mentioned, Canticle for Leibowitz, also Leigh Brackett's A Long Tomorrow.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.840
In A Long Tomorrow.

19:04.840 --> 19:09.280
It's a post-Holocaust America, and science has been suppressed.

19:09.660 --> 19:14.060
And after many years, two boys have been hunting and discovered Barterstown,

19:14.080 --> 19:18.720
where science is being secretly reestablished, and they have a nuclear generating station.

19:19.980 --> 19:25.820
Another story along these same lines is a juvenile novel written by Poul Anderson, The Vault of the Ages.

19:26.680 --> 19:30.820
And in this story, our 16-year-old hero is the son of a chief,

19:30.820 --> 19:39.060
and he is trying to reestablish science in the face of the tribal doctors who are trying to suppress science.

19:54.200 --> 19:58.820
Most of these bomb stories, I think, are meant by their authors as warnings.

20:01.820 --> 20:04.520
Of course, after the bomb was exploded in the Second World War,

20:04.520 --> 20:09.480
people became aware of the fact that they were living on a world that could be destroyed.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.040
Civilization could be destroyed if enough of those bombs were exploded.

20:13.240 --> 20:17.660
And there were many stories in books in which the author meant to warn people, to show them,

20:17.760 --> 20:19.400
what would happen if they weren't careful.

20:19.720 --> 20:24.620
And I think most of these types of books were intended to show that.

20:25.260 --> 20:28.700
There are many other types of cataclysm novels and movies.

20:30.100 --> 20:36.020
Those dealing with natural disasters, alien intervention or disasters, attacks, whatever.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.520
And one of those is the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

20:40.200 --> 20:45.840
That's where a spore-like creature migrates across space, lands on the earth, and takes root.

20:47.460 --> 20:54.380
And pod-like creatures literally duplicate human beings, their body and their memory,

20:54.380 --> 20:56.140
except when they are duplicated, they're different.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.080
They're part of a larger creature.

21:00.420 --> 21:08.280
The new pod people go about systematically linking all non-pod people up and making pod people out of them.

21:08.620 --> 21:14.020
And at the end of the book, you're left to believe that civilization is eventually going to be taken over.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.060
Yeah, that's one of the more negative ones, where the aliens manage to win.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.060
Another one like that is The Puppet Masters.

21:21.060 --> 21:25.260
They don't exactly win in this one, but it's by Robert Heinlein in 1951.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.200
One of the more popular books with aliens.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.640
They take over human bodies.

21:31.860 --> 21:34.820
They attach themselves to the human body and rule it.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.480
But they are eventually defeated.

21:37.340 --> 21:39.680
A completely different type of cataclysm book.

21:40.780 --> 21:45.020
Almost a unique one, I would say, is The Day of the Triffids from the 1950s.

21:45.020 --> 21:55.460
The Day of the Triffids, written by John Wyndham in 1951, is a rather unusual cataclysm story.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.360
The Earth is bombarded by a meteor shower.

22:00.640 --> 22:04.440
And the meteor shower blinds everyone who's seen it.

22:05.680 --> 22:10.500
The Earth at this time is also populated by a new type of plant called the Triffid,

22:10.600 --> 22:15.720
which can move about under its own power and has a long appendage,

22:15.800 --> 22:17.940
which has a sort of stinger at the end of it with a poison.

22:18.980 --> 22:22.780
Once the majority of the population has been blinded, they're now easy prey for the Triffids.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.700
It becomes a rather horrifying story at this point,

22:25.840 --> 22:31.180
where the people are herded about like cattle by the Triffids and are slowly consumed by them.

22:32.360 --> 22:38.660
On the human level, a young biologist who is specializing in the Triffids joins up with a group of people,

22:39.460 --> 22:46.400
and they set up a society in London where they're able to survive by collecting foodstuffs

22:46.400 --> 22:48.280
and dispensing them from a centralized area.

22:48.520 --> 22:53.900
They are forced to turn away the masses of blind people,

22:54.200 --> 22:56.980
except for women, which they allow into their compound

22:56.980 --> 23:01.600
because it's become necessary for them to reproduce a sighted society.

23:02.020 --> 23:04.880
All this is rather inhumane.

23:05.300 --> 23:09.840
One of the main implications of the book is showing how brutal societies had to become in order to survive.

23:10.820 --> 23:16.000
The book ends on a rather optimistic note in that they will eventually defeat the Triffids,

23:16.080 --> 23:18.300
but they don't really say how they're going to do that.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.060
Wyndham, I think, put a lot of ideas in his book.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.520
It's kind of heavy on ideas, even though it's a good adventure story.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.220
And I think he was treating, in some way, social Darwinism.

23:29.380 --> 23:31.520
As you mentioned, society is kind of cruel.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.020
It's survival of the fittest, as it is out in the jungle.

23:34.820 --> 23:38.680
And the weaker members of society, in this case the blind people, are not going to survive.

23:40.160 --> 23:44.980
British science fiction authors, I think, are especially noted for their treatment of catastrophe stories.

23:44.980 --> 23:51.500
And two authors who I can think of that do an excellent job with and after the cataclysm story

23:51.500 --> 23:54.240
would be J.G. Ballard and Christopher Priest.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.380
Priest's book, Inverted World, was published in 1974.

23:58.660 --> 24:00.520
This is a very unusual book.

24:00.660 --> 24:07.480
It deals with an idea that Priest apparently had from some of his scientific friends.

24:07.480 --> 24:11.100
It's designed on the idea of a hyperboloid planet.

24:11.340 --> 24:16.280
And what this means is a hyperboloid is like the opposite of a sphere.

24:16.640 --> 24:25.120
On this planet, the people who lived there would see north and south curving up

24:25.120 --> 24:32.060
and east and west curving down, away from a central flat area on which they existed.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.220
In the story, the Earth is still round.

24:36.220 --> 24:40.440
It's still just the same way it is now, except that there has been some kind of destruction, a crash.

24:40.940 --> 24:44.720
The people on it are normal, except for one group of people

24:44.720 --> 24:50.680
who were associated with a scientific project about 200 years back, about the time of the crash.

24:50.940 --> 24:55.520
A scientist tried to make a machine that would create energy

24:55.520 --> 25:02.160
by contrasting a normal radioactive field with some kind of other field that he had discovered.

25:02.620 --> 25:08.500
The only trouble is that the people who were exposed to this had their perspectives changed.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.780
They saw the world as the reverse of a sphere,

25:12.780 --> 25:17.940
a hyperboloid where two directions, like east and west,

25:18.100 --> 25:21.300
would curve down as going down the sides of a mountain.

25:21.500 --> 25:24.600
But if you looked to the north and to the south, it would curve up.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.880
This is like a saddle.

25:26.660 --> 25:30.860
The people who were exposed to this radiation have been genetically changed,

25:30.900 --> 25:34.120
and they themselves live in this perspective world.

25:34.260 --> 25:36.160
It's still the same Earth to everyone else,

25:36.260 --> 25:40.180
but to them, everything is distorted away from one central point,

25:40.200 --> 25:42.320
which they must maintain themselves on.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.060
This point moves across the surface of the Earth.

25:45.940 --> 25:49.660
Therefore, their city, which is like an office building on wheels,

25:49.660 --> 25:56.280
is moved along to maintain its position parallel to that position on the Earth.

25:56.900 --> 25:59.800
The entire city has been moving for 200 years.

26:00.060 --> 26:04.000
At the end of this time, at the time the story takes place,

26:04.260 --> 26:07.340
the city has been moving all the way across Asia and Europe,

26:07.880 --> 26:09.700
and it has run up against the ocean,

26:09.700 --> 26:14.080
and they really don't know exactly how to attempt crossing it.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.020
Some of them don't even know what it is.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.860
They think it's just another big river to cross.

26:18.860 --> 26:21.040
The other British author is J.G. Ballard,

26:21.060 --> 26:24.740
who deals with an ingenious post-catastrophe world.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.840
First of all, Ballard seems to have made a career

26:28.620 --> 26:30.360
in writing about catastrophes.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.680
Almost every book and story he's written

26:32.680 --> 26:34.440
deals with the end of civilization,

26:35.220 --> 26:36.700
mostly due to natural causes.

26:36.820 --> 26:39.680
He has one book where it's because of drought.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.780
The water on the world dries up.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.720
Civilization ends.

26:44.380 --> 26:47.760
He has another where civilization is destroyed by a huge wind,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.940
another in which the world becomes crystal, crystallized.

26:53.560 --> 26:57.120
But probably as best known as The Drowned World, published in 1962.

26:58.260 --> 27:00.920
It's a fascinating and original book, a very different one.

27:01.540 --> 27:05.260
Solar storms have stripped the Earth of its Van Allen belts,

27:05.860 --> 27:08.140
and the temperatures rise drastically.

27:08.980 --> 27:10.960
Over a long period, but they do rise.

27:12.120 --> 27:16.200
Civilization is destroyed as water covers almost everything.

27:16.620 --> 27:18.580
There are very few land masses left,

27:18.580 --> 27:20.640
but the polar caps are melting because of the heat.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.720
The water level rises.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.280
And what the world becomes is almost a duplicate

27:25.280 --> 27:28.140
of what it was like in the prehistoric days

27:28.140 --> 27:29.580
before any life was formed.

27:31.460 --> 27:35.960
And what Ballard centers on is how man changes physically

27:35.960 --> 27:38.520
to adapt to the new world.

27:39.380 --> 27:42.900
Most catastrophe books deal with how the hero can overcome the change

27:42.900 --> 27:44.760
or how he can reestablish civilization.

27:45.100 --> 27:47.640
This one shows how man changes psychically

27:47.640 --> 27:49.200
because of what's happened.

27:49.480 --> 27:53.520
And basically and briefly, what happens is that people revert.

27:53.520 --> 27:57.240
They experience devolution rather than evolution.

27:57.940 --> 28:01.420
Their cells in this new environment,

28:02.340 --> 28:06.860
their cells genetically remember their creation.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.320
Back in some primordial world,

28:09.820 --> 28:12.320
in the ocean beds with the warm sun on them,

28:12.400 --> 28:13.640
all the water, the hot sun,

28:13.800 --> 28:15.520
has caused these conditions to recur.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.160
And so what happens to people,

28:18.280 --> 28:20.140
particularly Robert Kerans, the protagonist,

28:21.600 --> 28:23.920
he reverts to a cellular life.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.520
Mentally, he reverts to one.

28:25.540 --> 28:26.440
He doesn't become a cell,

28:26.520 --> 28:29.960
but his mind responds to what it's like to be a cell,

28:30.740 --> 28:33.040
you know, experiencing life for the first time on Earth.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.140
It's a very kind of unique book,

28:35.220 --> 28:36.520
devolution rather than evolution.

28:37.580 --> 28:39.700
And one other British author we might mention briefly

28:39.700 --> 28:40.980
is Christopher Priest,

28:41.340 --> 28:43.720
a very well-known book, No Blade of Grass,

28:44.360 --> 28:46.780
in which all the grains and grasses of the Earth

28:46.780 --> 28:49.260
are wiped out by a virus.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.020
All kinds of cereals are gone,

28:51.180 --> 28:55.280
and this causes the, well, the end of modern civilization.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.560
This is David Crews,

29:04.900 --> 29:05.480
Daryl Lane,

29:05.780 --> 29:06.460
and David Carson.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.320
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

29:10.320 --> 29:13.760
a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

29:14.140 --> 29:16.700
in conjunction with KOCV-FM

29:16.700 --> 29:19.000
and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
