Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:27.640 --> 00:32.980
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:35.620 --> 00:37.320
And here are your hosts.

00:42.420 --> 00:50.440
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. How and when did science fiction begin?
Well, that's a question with numerous answers. And one major problem in

00:50.440 --> 00:57.120
answering it is that science fiction has not always been a separate category of
fiction. Its disengagement from so-called mainstream literature is fairly

00:57.120 --> 01:07.620
recent. Writer L. Sprague de Camp has some thoughts on the subject. You have to
remember that at one time, imaginative fiction, that is science fiction and

01:07.620 --> 01:21.380
fantasy, was the mainstream. Prior to, I think it was about the year 1719, when
Defoe published Robinson Crusoe, there was, practically speaking, no such thing

01:21.380 --> 01:33.840
as realistic fiction. There were one or two scattered exceptions, but, like the
first one was Don Quixote. But, by and large, practically all fiction had

01:33.840 --> 01:47.100
elements that we should recognize today as science fiction or fantasy. That is
to say, ghosts and miracles and marvelous gadgets of one kind or another. Why,

01:47.200 --> 01:58.760
the Odyssey is a science fiction and fantasy saga right there, with the witch
Circe turning people into pigs, and the monsters, Scylla and Charybdis, eating

01:58.760 --> 02:08.060
ships, and so on. The transformation of imaginative literature into what we
recognize today as science fiction occurred in the early part of this century,

02:08.240 --> 02:16.660
mostly in the pulp magazines, such as Hugo Gernsback's Amazing Stories. Jack
Williamson, who wrote for Gernsback, recalls that there was no term science

02:16.660 --> 02:27.140
fiction when Amazing Stories began in the 20s. When I started, my first story
was printed as scientifiction. Hugo Gernsback ran the words science and fiction

02:27.140 --> 02:38.640
together. He invented the term science fiction in 29, I think. And at that time,
you had to explain what it was. I used to say it was adventure stories with a

02:38.640 --> 02:51.020
science background. This science background was of importance to Gernsback, yet
he still wanted stories with excitement and adventure. He preached a gospel that

02:51.020 --> 03:04.280
science fiction was sugar-coated science, that it was education. And he got a
whole panel of experts with degrees that were supposed to vet the science and

03:04.280 --> 03:20.140
science wonder stories when he started that. But actually, I think that was as
much for, well, to impress the readers as anything else, because he did use true

03:20.140 --> 03:30.060
science in his stories when he could get it, but he also printed a lot of
stories that were pretty wild. I think always in the magazine, the adventure

03:30.060 --> 03:39.900
element was more important than the science. At first, professional writers
didn't contribute much scientifiction to the pulps. The field was new, its

03:39.900 --> 03:51.140
readership was uncertain, and the rates were low. In the beginning, they were...
Amazing was filled up with reprints of classic science fiction, and the rates

03:51.140 --> 03:59.680
were so low that professional writers didn't write for them, so that when they
wrote new stories, they were mostly written by immatures such as myself. The

03:59.680 --> 04:06.780
classic science fiction Williamson mentions was work by authors who were
immensely popular around the turn of the century and a bit earlier, such as

04:06.780 --> 04:16.860
Jules Verne, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and H.G. Wells. But the new writers did come.
In a field that has yet had no definition or shape, these new authors created

04:16.860 --> 04:24.520
the styles and themes that are the foundation of today's science fiction. And
most of them, as Williamson recalls, started out in John Campbell's Astounding

04:24.520 --> 04:37.300
Stories. They all started in Campbell's magazine. Astounding. He was... Well, I
don't know whether you'd say Campbell discovered them or they discovered him,

04:37.320 --> 04:54.380
but it was, let's say, a small group with a great deal of, well, fellowship or
fellow understanding and so forth. And it was an exciting period in which to be

04:54.380 --> 04:54.820
alive.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:55.380 --> 05:59.280
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:16.400 --> 06:21.740
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:24.380 --> 06:26.080
And here are your hosts.

06:30.720 --> 06:39.160
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. What we today call science fiction took
shape in the pages of the colorful pulp magazines of the 1920s and 30s. Jack

06:39.160 --> 06:46.440
Williamson, who wrote for those pulp magazines, is a living history of science
fiction. His career as a writer goes back to the 1920s, before the term science

06:46.440 --> 06:53.060
fiction was even created. He grew up in the early part of this century on the
frontier plains of New Mexico. Not long after he discovered the fresh and

06:53.060 --> 07:00.640
exciting new world of science fiction, he began selling his work to Hugo
Gernsback's Amazing Stories, which was the first science fiction publication. I

07:00.640 --> 07:13.820
grew up on a sandhill farm in the south part of this county when times were
pretty grim. And I, well, wanted to be some sort of scientist without any

07:13.820 --> 07:26.540
direction or means to get a scientific education. And a few months after
Gernsback started the old amazing, well, I came across some copies of it. And I

07:26.540 --> 07:40.500
was immediately fascinated with experiments that worked, with travel in time and
spaceships to other worlds and all sorts of wonderful things. And it's been an

07:40.500 --> 07:49.400
important share of my life ever since. The pay scale for early science fiction
writers was minimal. There were no movie rights or paperback contracts. Yet

07:49.400 --> 07:59.120
Williamson was able to produce enough fiction to make a living at it. Gernsback
paid a half a cent a word or less, which meant, well, you could get $25 for a

07:59.120 --> 08:12.320
short story and $75 for a novelette. But Clayton paid two cents a word and up,
which is one reason maybe the Clayton magazines went bankrupt in the Great

08:12.320 --> 08:28.040
Depression. But that meant that I could pound out 4,000 words a day for two days
and earn $160, which was a fabulous feat for a farm kid in Depression days.

08:36.000 --> 08:43.780
Amazing Stories was a pulp magazine. A pulp was printed on cheap paper. They
were usually large format magazines with lurid and colorful illustrations on the

08:43.780 --> 08:54.440
cover to catch the attention of prospective readers. In those days, before the
paperbacks and before TV and before the comics, when people read a lot more for

08:54.440 --> 09:03.200
entertainment than they do nowadays, and there were really three sorts of
magazines. There were the quality magazines like Harper's and the old

09:03.200 --> 09:15.020
Scribner's, Atlantic for people with brains, and the slicks printed on coated
paper that would take good advertising for people with money to spend, and the

09:15.020 --> 09:30.500
pulp for people who had neither brains nor money. But we had a lot of fun in the
pulps, even if we were looked down upon widely. And eventually, science fiction

09:30.500 --> 09:40.580
got recognized as being not entirely without brains, let's say. And nowadays,
there's a little bit of money in it sometimes. A good deal of this early science

09:40.580 --> 09:47.440
fiction published in the pulps was space opera, a term which denotes a
melodramatic form of science fiction characterized by heroes and villains,

09:48.100 --> 09:56.060
maidens in distress, and intergalactic warfare. Right, Buck Rogers-type stuff.
It's unsophisticated, but Williamson admires it, and he points out it's still

09:56.060 --> 10:05.060
around in the movies. I've never objected to space opera. I still think it's
wonderful, and I even think that Star Wars could have been made out of my Legion

10:05.060 --> 10:18.900
stories as well as it was from something else. I enjoyed Star Wars tremendously
as a sort of adolescent daydream, and, well, the pulp readers were mostly young

10:18.900 --> 10:28.720
and as naive as I was, and the space opera was a sort of symbolic escape from
all sorts of things.

10:35.260 --> 10:43.340
Though it does still turn up now and then, space opera was left behind as
science fiction, along with Jack Williamson, moved ahead into its golden age.

10:50.220 --> 10:58.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:58.120 --> 11:28.620
Odessa, Texas. 

12:28.260 --> 12:32.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:47.400 --> 12:52.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.020
And here are your hosts.

13:01.340 --> 13:10.700
This is Bill Vernon and David Crews. In the late 1930s, science fiction was in
transition. In one sense, it was becoming more sophisticated, outgrowing its

13:10.700 --> 13:22.380
early emphasis on space opera. Jack Williamson, who wrote space opera, considers
this change natural. I was growing up, and the readers were growing up. That's

13:22.380 --> 13:31.800
something that's been going on in science fiction, at least in American science
fiction all along. I think you can draw a distinction between, let's say,

13:31.960 --> 13:44.120
European or mainstream science fiction on the one hand, which has always been
recognized and treated as literature, and the American science fiction, which

13:44.120 --> 13:55.160
was looked down on. But as the readers of that grew older, some of them started
writing, some of them started editing magazines. Most of them outgrew science

13:55.160 --> 14:08.760
fiction, but some of them didn't. So there was a continual increase in the
education, the sophistication, and so forth of the whole field. Among these

14:08.760 --> 14:16.340
readers of pulp science fiction were a few who developed into those authors
whose work defined what science fiction would become in later years. These early

14:16.340 --> 14:25.560
readers were people like Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, A.E. van Vogt, Theodore
Sturgeon, L. Sprague de Camp, Frederik Pohl, and Hal Clement. And these authors

14:25.560 --> 14:34.740
are now the classics, those who wrote in that very special period of science
fiction called The Golden Age. A.E. van Vogt, looking back at that period, says

14:34.740 --> 14:42.880
that he read the authors who were starting out then with him, but that he had no
idea they were doing anything special. Well, I read their stories. You know what

14:42.880 --> 14:53.120
I mean? I was always fascinated by these various stories. I read every issue
that came out. So when you say, what was it like, it just seemed like a

14:53.120 --> 15:02.900
perfectly natural thing that was happening. The notion that we were operating in
a special period of time did not occur to me. You know, I mean, we were just

15:02.900 --> 15:12.360
doing our thing. And everybody was evidently stimulated in a special way.
Frederik Pohl belonged to a group of writers and fans in New York called the

15:12.360 --> 15:22.080
Futurians. He remembers the closeness of the group and how they would help each
other. Well, science fiction has some special traits, and one of them is that

15:22.080 --> 15:33.460
its readers herd together as much as they can. They form fan clubs and
associations and correspondence groups and so on. And in New York City, there

15:33.460 --> 15:44.880
were quite a few science fiction fans. And about 25 or 30, most of whom wanted
to be writers, formed a club called the Futurians. There were people like Cyril

15:44.880 --> 15:57.020
Kornbluth and Isaac Asimov and Damon Knight and myself and quite a few others.
We did discuss each other's work a lot. And I guess in the process of

15:57.020 --> 16:07.040
criticizing it, there was a lot of help given. I think the biggest factor that
made it easier for a lot of us to go on with writing was just the knowledge that

16:07.040 --> 16:18.580
other people were doing it. And also the fact that we collaborated a lot. We
remedied each other's deficiencies by writing, I mean, by collaborating on

16:18.580 --> 16:28.280
single stories. And although most of the stories were not very good, we did
learn something by seeing how other people would tackle the same subjects we

16:28.280 --> 16:36.820
were writing about. L. Sprague de Camp also remembers this closeness among
writers at the beginning of the Golden Age. But like van Vogt, de Camp says that

16:36.820 --> 16:49.000
the authors had no sense of participating in anything special. Well, I dare say
that various ones of us did have their dreams and fancies at times and wondered

16:49.000 --> 17:03.080
how it was all going to come out. And would this become, would the genre expand
and take over the mainstream and various things of that sort? But as to that,

17:03.220 --> 17:11.720
mostly it was, as I said, it was simply a matter of making a living. But the
living those young writers made is the foundation of today's science fiction.

17:18.980 --> 17:26.900

Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

17:26.900 --> 17:27.660

18:11.060 --> 18:14.980
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:30.560 --> 18:35.840
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.180
And here are your hosts.

18:45.620 --> 18:54.700
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson. No individual has left his imprint on
modern science fiction as deeply as John W. Campbell. And he didn't do it as a

18:54.700 --> 19:02.280
writer, though he did write good science fiction. He did it as an editor. Jack
Williamson, who wrote for Campbell, speaks of the qualities that made Campbell

19:02.280 --> 19:13.400
the most important editor in the history of science fiction. I think he
influenced the way nearly everybody wrote science fiction, because when he

19:13.400 --> 19:26.740
became an editor of Amazing, and later changed the, I mean Astounding, and later
changed the name to Analog, why he had the best, highest-paying market in the

19:26.740 --> 19:37.620
field. He was, well, let's say science fiction was serious to him as a way of
speculating about science and its impact and the future of

19:37.620 --> 19:51.620
mankind and so forth. He was tremendously inventive. He was full of ideas that
he shared very freely. And everybody who was writing science fiction for those

19:51.620 --> 20:01.560
years was influenced by Campbell, it seems to me, whether directly or not. If
they weren't trying to write for him and reading his letters, they were reading

20:01.560 --> 20:16.920
such writers as Heinlein and De Camp and Sturgeon and a dozen others who were
Campbell writers. From 1938 to 1950, Campbell edited Astounding Stories. 1939,

20:17.460 --> 20:24.260
his second year as the head of the magazine, was a high point in the history of
science fiction. It was in that year that Campbell published the first science

20:24.260 --> 20:35.120
fiction stories of Robert Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon, A.E. Van Vogt, and Isaac
Asimov. Williamson remembers reading their first works in Astounding. They all

20:35.120 --> 20:47.980
started in Campbell's magazine. Astounding. He was, well, I don't know whether
you'd say Campbell discovered them or they discovered him, but it was, let's

20:47.980 --> 21:04.240
say, a small group with a great deal of, well, fellowship or fellow
understanding and so forth. It was an exciting period in which to be alive. If

21:04.240 --> 21:11.680
you were a science fiction fan, it was an exciting period in which to be alive,
all right. And John Campbell was the right man at the right time, a leader who

21:11.680 --> 21:19.680
guided, pushed, and cajoled science fiction into the modern world. A.E. Van
Vogt, one of science fiction's classic authors, recalls that he might not have

21:19.680 --> 21:28.200
ever written science fiction if not for Campbell's encouragement. I had read
science fiction when I was 14 in the early Amazing.

21:31.280 --> 21:41.880
And, however, it was, the Amazing Stories was taken over from Hugo Gernsback by
a man called T. O'Conor Sloane, or T. Conor O'Sloane, or something like that.

21:42.780 --> 21:53.420
And he didn't know how to edit a magazine. And after he'd been editing it for a
few issues, I lost interest in. So I never read it again until 1938 when I

21:53.420 --> 22:05.800
picked up the issue of Astounding titled, in which Campbell's own story under a
pseudonym was, Who Goes There? And when I read that story, I sent him a letter

22:05.800 --> 22:07.880
outlining an idea.

22:10.920 --> 22:21.220
And he answered me. So if he hadn't answered, I may not have had a science
fiction career. But I discovered later he answered all letters like that. In

22:21.220 --> 22:29.180
addition to encouraging authors, Campbell had helped them locate story ideas.
Frederik Pohl, himself an important editor, says this was one of Campbell's

22:29.180 --> 22:39.160
greatest strengths as an editor. Quite a few stories come to be written because
an editor says, listen, you've got a notion here that you are throwing away and

22:39.160 --> 22:47.680
you really should expand it. John Campbell was superb at that sort of thing.
Some of the best stories he published were the result of his telling a writer

22:47.680 --> 22:58.580
that he had an idea that he didn't realize he had. John W. Campbell. Science
fiction would be here, even if he hadn't been, but it surely wouldn't be the

22:58.580 --> 22:58.920
same.

23:06.220 --> 23:14.100
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

23:14.100 --> 23:14.860
Odessa, Texas.

24:46.160 --> 24:51.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.820
And here are your hosts.

25:02.340 --> 25:10.520
This is Daryl Lane. And David Carson. Science fiction owes a debt to John W.
Campbell. He brought it into the modern world and had a large hand in initiating

25:10.520 --> 25:18.560
its golden age. During his period as editor of Astounding Stories, from 1938 to
1950, Campbell discovered and encouraged writers who are now classics in the

25:18.560 --> 25:26.400
field of science fiction. Author Jack Williamson says that Campbell's influence
on an author was not heavy-handed or overly critical. He was even supportive of

25:26.400 --> 25:35.780
ideas he didn't agree with if they happened to be good ones. Campbell and I
thought so much alike so that I always felt at home with his magazine and

25:35.780 --> 25:51.680
enjoyed working with him. And he gave me occasional very useful suggestions that
I used. And he never did, well, edit my material heavily or try to persuade me

25:51.680 --> 26:01.120
to say anything I didn't want to say. I believe that personally he was
optimistic about science and the future, but when I wrote such a pessimistic

26:01.120 --> 26:12.160
dystopian thing as "With Folded Hands", well, he published it as it was, and I
asked for more. Campbell influenced his authors in different ways. L. Sprague de

26:12.160 --> 26:21.360
Camp, for instance, remembers him as a teacher, but not as a source of original
ideas. I learned a great deal of what I think I know about storytelling from

26:21.360 --> 26:34.080
him. One thing that did not occur between us was his proposing story ideas and
having me write them because I've never been very good at turning other people's

26:34.080 --> 26:50.340
ideas into effective stories. So he may have tried it a few times, but when
nothing came of it, why, he, I guess he quit. I can't think of one story that he

26:50.340 --> 27:03.660
proposed, and I wrote the story, but then he rejected it. I finally sold it to
one of his competitors. That was "The Ghosts of Melvin Pye". He suggested a ghost

27:03.660 --> 27:12.100
story in which the dead man had had a split personality, so he had two ghosts.
One thing that Campbell would insist on in stories he bought was scientific

27:12.100 --> 27:20.860
accuracy, the consistency with actual science and the laws of the universe.
Author Hal Clement talks about Campbell's insistence on credibility. John was

27:20.860 --> 27:32.520
the one who bought my first several stories. I knew him quite well, talked to
him quite often. While I didn't always agree with him, we both felt that there

27:32.520 --> 27:43.760
were rules and that they ought to be followed. We were both materialists, I
guess. We felt that the universe does run by rule, and we felt that a story was

27:43.760 --> 27:55.060
most believable when it matched those rules, at least as we, meaning humanity in
general, currently understood them. Campbell was involved in publishing

27:55.060 --> 28:02.240
Clement's science fiction novel, Mission of Gravity. Frederik Pohl, who was
Clement's agent at that time, tells an interesting story regarding the

28:02.240 --> 28:12.380
circumstances of its publication. Pohl sent the novel to Campbell, who rejected
it. He sent it back. He said, pretty good stuff, but you should know, Fred, that

28:12.380 --> 28:22.180
there's a difference between a novel that reads well as a book and a novel that
reads well as a serial, and this one just does not break as a serial. So I knew

28:22.180 --> 28:32.500
he was wrong, and I knew I couldn't argue him out of it. And so I looked at the
manuscript, which was, I think, 270 pages long or something like that, and I

28:32.500 --> 28:43.200
counted up to page 90 and drew a line under a paragraph there, and counted up to
page 180 and drew a line under a paragraph there, and had my secretary retype a

28:43.200 --> 28:51.240
couple of pages on each side of each line, saying at the bottom of the first
part, end of part one, and the beginning of the second part, beginning of part

28:51.240 --> 29:00.600
two, and I let it sit for a couple weeks, and I sent it back to John, and he
bought it. Mission of Gravity, of course, went on to become one of the classic

29:00.600 --> 29:08.120
science fiction novels, and Campbell is remembered as the greatest editor of
science fiction has ever had. It is not coincidental that his time at the head

29:08.120 --> 29:13.340
of Astounding Stories, 1938 to 1950, is now called the Golden Age of Science
Fiction.
