00:09.340 --> 00:13.380
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show so stay with us.

00:28.960 --> 00:34.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.700
And here are your hosts.

00:42.700 --> 00:50.980
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. Sooner or later a true science fiction fan
has to attend a convention. Conventions range from the incredible Worldcon, a

00:50.980 --> 00:58.000
world science fiction convention with thousands of people in attendance to small
local gatherings with less than 100 fans and then there are the conventions in

00:58.000 --> 01:04.440
the middle big enough to attract first-rank authors and have a fascinating
dealer's room but small enough to create a comfortable intimate atmosphere

01:04.440 --> 01:12.320
between guests and fans. Such a convention is AggieCon, a yearly science fiction
gathering held in College Station, Texas. AggieCon is organized and run by

01:12.320 --> 01:21.140
students at Texas A&M University. At the last AggieCon, Number 14, held in the
spring of 1983, we spoke with Gordon Lewis, the head of the AggieCon committee. We

01:21.140 --> 01:29.740
asked him to give us a little of the background behind AggieCon. AggieCon
Number One so far as I know was not originally called AggieCon. It was just

01:29.740 --> 01:40.240
called the Science the Texas A&M Science Fiction Convention, or
something to that effect, and they just decided it would be real fun to invite an

01:40.240 --> 01:51.080
author down and have a little miniature convention that lasted two days, and I
think they showed three films. I saw a report on AggieCon Four - I think AggieCon

01:51.080 --> 02:00.180
three was the first one that was called AggieCon - I saw a report on number four.
They took in a total of eight hundred dollars and spent four hundred dollars and

02:00.180 --> 02:11.360
they had two guests and showed six films total and that was about all the
programming they had. And since then we have moved onward and upward to better

02:11.360 --> 02:22.320
and better things to where this year we have 30 guests, we're showing eight major
films at night, we have uh films running all day long, and we have the panels and

02:22.320 --> 02:31.220
the readings and our budget this year is something like uh to take in 15 000 and
to spend around 14 000, was what was budgeted.

02:48.600 --> 02:56.320
Putting on a major science fiction convention as AggieCon certainly is takes a
good deal of work the work is done by a committee on the Texas A&M campus called

02:56.320 --> 03:09.240
Cepheid Variable. We asked Lewis what the word cepheid variable meant. A cepheid
variable is a pulsating star which um there is one in the Cephas star system and

03:09.240 --> 03:19.500
if you look at it it will appear to grow brighter and dimmer and occasionally to
change colors and that's where we took our name from. What does Cepheid Variable

03:19.500 --> 03:31.300
actually do? Cepheid Variable is a science fiction and fantasy committee. It's out
of the student programs office here on campus and because we are a committee we

03:31.300 --> 03:41.060
do programming through the student programs office. Some of the other clubs on
campus do their own activities and programming just for their own members but we

03:41.060 --> 03:50.460
program for the entire university as well as AggieCon, which is for people who
aren't even members of the university. Is AggieCon the only responsibility of

03:50.460 --> 04:00.340
Cepheid Variable? That's our major reason for being; however, we also program all
year long. We show science fiction fantasy films here on campus and we are a

04:00.340 --> 04:10.500
meeting place for science fiction fantasy fans here on campus. Also on occasion
we do send delegates to other conventions within the state as well as outside

04:10.500 --> 04:18.840
the state. Usually in the summertime though because most of our students are busy
during the fall and spring. Lewis says 95 percent of the members of Cepheid

04:18.840 --> 04:29.780
Variable are students at the university but not all. Uh we have a few who are not.
Most of them are like uh we have one former student we have one person who is

04:29.780 --> 04:38.440
laying out for a few semesters while he works and that way he can become a Texas
resident and not have to pay out of state tuition and uh Becky Matthews, who is

04:38.440 --> 04:46.960
one of our guests, we kind of count her as a member of the convention committee
because she was chairman of AggieCon 11 and uh has helped us with the roast

04:46.960 --> 04:52.780
program this year. Next time we'll talk with Gordon Lewis about the fascinating
attractions AggieCon has to offer.

04:59.760 --> 05:07.820
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:07.820 --> 05:19.960
Odessa, Texas. 

05:55.780 --> 06:01.360
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us. 

06:16.860 --> 06:23.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:25.440 --> 06:35.000
And here are your hosts. This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. Aggicon is one of the best known

06:35.000 --> 06:39.300
science fiction conventions in the Southwest. It's held each year on the campus of Texas A&M

06:39.300 --> 06:44.020
University and is organized by the students at the university. Gordon Lewis, the head of the

06:44.020 --> 06:48.160
committee which is responsible for Aggicon, tells us what Aggicon has to offer a science fiction

06:48.160 --> 06:53.240
fan. There of course are the movies. I believe they have movies that are just about every

06:53.240 --> 06:59.080
science fiction convention. We have the dealer's room which you can find just about anything and

06:59.080 --> 07:07.500
everything in there from books to weapons to posters and other kind of paraphernalia from movies

07:07.500 --> 07:14.660
and the world of fantasy. We have the artists and the authors. They sit on panels, some of the

07:14.660 --> 07:23.040
authors do readings for us. We had a NASA presentation yesterday. We have had one of those
for the past three years, and we consider that to be pretty regular at this

07:27.380 --> 07:38.360
convention. We're having a slideshow this afternoon on Don Punchatz's artwork,
and we try to have an art slideshow, or at least we've been trying to, for the

07:38.360 --> 07:49.000
past three years. We have the two movie companies that are here, Disney and
Columbia Pictures, that are promoting films, and I believe that since I've been

07:49.000 --> 07:59.500
here at AggieCon 12, I believe we didn't have any movie promotions, but at 11
and 13, and at this one, we have had movie promotions. We have trivia quizzes.

07:59.800 --> 08:09.600
We have the amateur art contest. We have the art auction, as well as other stuff
that's auctioned off. This year we had the world premiere performance of Mr.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.000
Harry Harrison's play. That is a first, as far as I know.

08:15.880 --> 08:24.620
We also have the pro art gallery, where pro artists can display their work, and
the fans can come and look at it. We have an autograph session, a guest

08:24.620 --> 08:31.220
reception. Plus, you can usually find the guests down in the party room, if
they're not doing anything else.

08:46.660 --> 08:54.920
The authors at this year's AggieCon, the 14th, would have interested any science
fiction fan. Harry Harrison was the guest of honor, and there was also a special

08:54.920 --> 09:02.080
guest, Stephen R. Donaldson. Harrison has written science fiction for a long
time, and is known for such works as the Death World books, and for the

09:02.080 --> 09:09.080
stainless steel rat novels. And Donaldson is one of the hottest fantasy authors
working today. His two Chronicles of Thomas Covenant series have sold in the

09:09.080 --> 09:16.140
millions. Lewis says that this year's AggieCon gave more emphasis to one aspect
of science fiction and fantasy that many casual readers don't give much thought

09:16.140 --> 09:25.100
to. This year we have really tried to do more stuff for the artists than we ever
have in the past. Usually we have like one panel, the amateur art contest, the

09:25.100 --> 09:36.000
auction, and that's about it. And this year we've programmed two panels on art.
We again have the auction and the contest. We have more judges for the contest

09:36.000 --> 09:43.640
this year than we've had in the past. The artist guest of honor was Michael
Whelan, who for the past two years running has been given the Nebula Award as

09:43.640 --> 09:50.480
the best science fiction fantasy artist of the year. Anyone who reads science
fiction has seen Whelan's work. His paintings are found on the covers of many

09:50.480 --> 09:59.040
science fiction and fantasy books. One of his latest creations was on the dust
jacket of Arthur C. Clarke's best-selling novel, 2010, Odyssey 2. We asked Lewis

09:59.040 --> 10:07.280
how AggieCon compared with other science fiction conventions in Texas. Well, we
have been billed as the largest annual science fiction convention so far as

10:07.280 --> 10:18.580
attendance is concerned. Overall, I do believe that we have a larger attendance
if you count both the one-day passes as well as the full convention passes than

10:18.580 --> 10:29.160
what other science fiction conventions have. A lot of that is probably due to
the students here on campus. But we do bring in quite a few outside individuals.

10:29.640 --> 10:40.320
For instance, this year we had 60 non-student convention passes for the full
convention that were sold in advance. That means before March 1st. We'll

10:40.320 --> 10:42.660
conclude our conversation with Gordon Lewis on our next show.

10:49.980 --> 10:57.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

10:57.860 --> 11:28.060
Odessa, Texas. 

11:47.500 --> 11:51.460
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:07.420 --> 12:12.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:15.420 --> 12:16.920
And here are your hosts.

12:21.020 --> 12:28.360
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. We are talking with Gordon Lewis, head of
the Texas A&M Student Committee, which put on this year's successful AggieCon.

12:28.600 --> 12:36.000
And this year's AggieCon, the 14th, has to be considered a success. The guest of
honor was science fiction author Harry Harrison, making one of his occasional

12:36.000 --> 12:43.060
trips to the United States from his home in Ireland. The special guest of honor
was Stephen R. Donaldson. Probably no fantasy author since Tolkien has sold more

12:43.060 --> 12:51.880
books than Donaldson has. His Chronicles of Thomas Covenant 1 and 2 have sold in
the millions. The activities at AggieCon 14 were numerous and fascinating. Fans

12:51.880 --> 12:57.580
could mingle with the authors and ask questions about their work, for one thing.
And this opportunity would have to be the heart of any science fiction

12:57.580 --> 13:06.500
convention. But there was also a well-stocked dealer's room, movies 24 hours a
day, panels, art shows, a masquerade. In other words, enough activity to give a

13:06.500 --> 13:14.580
fan a complete immersion in science fiction for almost four full days. We asked
Gordon Lewis how they went about getting authors to be guests of AggieCon. Well,

13:14.920 --> 13:22.180
usually what we like to do is there are some authors here in Texas, as well as
some artists, who are kind of like traditionalists at AggieCon. They've been

13:22.180 --> 13:32.000
coming for several years. We try and invite all of them, and usually most of
them will come down here. So far as our major guests, we have the guest of

13:32.000 --> 13:41.520
honor, and we have a special guest. This year we were going to have co-guests of
honor. We were going to have Ann McCaffrey as well as Harry Harrison, but Ann

13:41.520 --> 13:43.500
had to back out because of medical problems.

13:47.060 --> 13:54.980
Harry Harrison was then left as our only guest of honor, which in the past we've
only had one. We have our special guest, like I said. We have a toastmaster.

13:55.560 --> 14:05.640
This year it's Dr. Chad Oliver from the University of Texas, and he will be
presenting a program at the banquet this evening. He said he'd give us 15

14:05.640 --> 14:13.960
minutes of wit and humor. Chad Oliver has been writing science fiction for over
30 years and has been a regular feature at AggieCon. Some of the other local

14:13.960 --> 14:21.460
authors attending AggieCon 14 were Howard Waldrop, Lee Kennedy, Ardath Mayhar,
and George Proctor. The out-of-state writers included Ed Bryant and Bob

14:21.460 --> 14:31.920
Vardeman. We asked Louis what the biggest problem in planning AggieCon was. The
fact that all of the officers are students, and we all have our homework here

14:31.920 --> 14:40.740
from the university, plus all of the paperwork that is required. And I think the
only reason that was a real problem at this convention was because none of the

14:40.740 --> 14:48.780
paperwork was done when I took over in mid-October. I ended up having to do the
majority of the paperwork, I and my officers, at that point.

15:00.180 --> 15:07.080
AggieCon is put together by a student committee at Texas A&M University known as
Cepheid Variable. We wondered if the students joined the committee because they

15:07.080 --> 15:16.960
were serious science fiction fans, or just for social reasons. Both, really. The
majority of the people in there are really interested in science fiction. I,

15:16.960 --> 15:27.160
myself, am very interested in science fiction and fantasy. And it is a pretty
nice social atmosphere also. The majority of the people in the committee are

15:27.160 --> 15:36.640
real good friends, and we get along real well. How many students from Cepheid
Variable work on the convention? We have, if I remember right, 16 officers.

15:37.000 --> 15:48.580
Eight of those have assistants. And we have probably ten of what we term
gofers, which means general officer for everything ridiculous. Basically, they

15:48.580 --> 15:58.440
are the peons in the organization that go and do everything that the rest of us
don't have time for. And then, so far as workers at the convention, just general

15:58.440 --> 16:07.560
committee members that worked, there are probably another ten to twenty of
those. Lewis says the experience of putting on AggieCon is worthwhile, but... I

16:07.560 --> 16:16.500
would say that no one should criticize the way a science fiction fantasy
convention is run until they've been on my end of the deal. Because until you

16:16.500 --> 16:24.320
have tried to set one of these things up, you really don't have any
understanding as to what it takes to do so. All of the paperwork and all of the

16:24.320 --> 16:32.440
correspondence that has to be done, it really is a very big job, and I'm sure
that this year I could not have done it without the help of all of my officers.

16:39.340 --> 16:47.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

16:47.280 --> 16:48.040
Odessa, Texas.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.980
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:58.720 --> 18:04.100
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:06.780 --> 18:08.460
And here are your hosts.

18:12.660 --> 18:20.040
This is Daryl Lane and David Carson. The science fiction of Dean Ing is always
exciting and fast-paced, making it difficult for readers to put his books down.

18:20.340 --> 18:28.500
But his work also has messages to it, some information, some opinions that Ing
wishes to communicate through the entertaining and exciting narrative. Anasazi,

18:28.640 --> 18:35.280
Systemic Shock, and Soft Targets are all good examples of exciting science
fiction novels by Ing, which carry some messages or information along with a

18:35.280 --> 18:41.360
story. Ing bases his writing on ideas, which he's interested in at the time he
writes. He tells us about some of his interests.

19:09.940 --> 19:17.620
There are a couple of themes that have occupied me a lot. I've been talking
about 20 years ago when nobody else cared. Now, a lot of people care. And now

19:17.620 --> 19:28.260
I'm not interested in it much anymore because it's already been, not because of
me, really, but for whatever reason, it has been taken up as an important issue.

19:28.260 --> 19:42.460
The second thing along that line would be survival, not only nuclear survival,
but various other kinds. I write in survival publications. I design backpackers'

19:42.600 --> 19:56.640
wood stoves and all kinds of other gadgetry that would be very useful in
survival contexts. I've had to make my own snowshoes to get out of the High

19:56.640 --> 20:05.040
Sierra one particular summer, which was hardly like a summer at all. It was a
very late spring.

20:08.160 --> 20:16.840
But survival, and particularly the nuclear holocaust survival issue, is one that
I have dealt with for two or three years now.

20:25.900 --> 20:32.260
The End, Ing's latest book, is a good example of his method of writing about his
immediate concerns. It's called Pulling Through, and it's based on the theme of

20:32.260 --> 20:46.860
survival. Pulling Through is a short novel on nuclear survival in the San
Francisco Bay Area. And the short novel is followed in the same book by five

20:46.860 --> 20:57.100
articles, nonfiction articles, detailing some of the gadgetry and techniques
that these people use to stay alive. So that it is not only a fast-paced, short

20:57.100 --> 21:09.260
novel, but it is also a manual of nuclear survival. Ng says he normally tries to
proportion his stories between 90% entertainment and 10% information, but

21:09.260 --> 21:19.460
pulling through is a slight departure from that formula. That is a novel in
which, oh, I must have 20% information in there and only 80% entertainment. But

21:19.460 --> 21:38.500
it is, again, extremely fast-paced. I set a nuclear survival scenario in the
context of a great big overbearing and overwhelming bounty hunter in California.

21:38.960 --> 21:50.380
The kind of guy who, you know, goes around with weapons all the time and has a
fairly high-tech environment. He's a man around whom things just happen, and

21:50.380 --> 22:05.460
they happen fast. But the book is probably 20% information. It's, I guess, the
most thoroughly information-packed novel I've ever written. And the reviews that

22:05.460 --> 22:14.800
are just coming out are very nice reviews. So far, I haven't heard anybody
complain that it's dull. Pulling Through is definitely not a dull novel. It's a

22:14.800 --> 22:21.160
fresh experiment in science fiction and one that will fascinate readers. We hope
Ng continues to include information in his books, along with the narrative.

22:21.420 --> 22:23.580
That's really what science fiction is all about, anyhow.

22:30.920 --> 22:38.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

22:38.740 --> 22:39.480
Odessa, Texas.

23:49.800 --> 23:55.160
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.520
And here are your hosts.

24:03.620 --> 24:11.360
This is David Carson. And Daryl Lane. Donald A. Wollheim has been involved in
science fiction for over half a century. His influence has been, and still is,

24:11.440 --> 24:18.800
considerable. He was one of the original fans back in the 30s, and helped start
the famous science fiction group, the Futurians, in New York in the late 1930s.

24:18.920 --> 24:26.140
He's written numerous novels and short stories. He's been an editor of science
fiction for 40 years, and was responsible for the creation of the ace science

24:26.140 --> 24:34.300
fiction line. And today he's head of DAW Science Fiction Books, the publishing
house he founded in 1972. Obviously, Wollheim knows science fiction inside and

24:34.300 --> 24:41.300
out. We asked him to comment on science fiction as a separate category of
literature. Isn't that distinction between science fiction and other fiction,

24:41.480 --> 24:52.780
particularly mainstream, really an artificial one maintained by the publishing
industry? Well, let me put it this way. It is an artificial category. All

24:52.780 --> 25:06.960
literature is literature. But, for the purposes of marketing, it is necessary to
mark out the different genres or categories of what you might call standard

25:06.960 --> 25:17.900
reading. This derives from the fact of the old days of the pulp magazines, when
a magazine was clearly marked a western, or a detective magazine, or a science

25:17.900 --> 25:28.180
fiction magazine. And because it knew that readers who bought that magazine knew
what they were going to get. A mainstream is a very varied product. It consists

25:28.180 --> 25:40.660
of a story of books of modern adventure, books of future life, books of past
life, books of historical, just experimental work. It can be anything. And your

25:40.660 --> 25:50.600
reader of category literature, which is actually, I think, the vast majority,
know what they want. What they want is similar to what they have been reading.

25:50.960 --> 26:02.980
In other words, they don't really want to jump into something which is outside
that which takes them into an escape. They are reading for escape reading. So

26:02.980 --> 26:12.000
you market science fiction because that's what they're looking for. You market a
western if that's what they happen to like. If your western reader picks up

26:12.000 --> 26:22.200
something which is mainstream, he isn't going to like it. It doesn't give him
what he's seeking. The same thing with romance novels. So you have to make it a

26:22.200 --> 26:33.220
category whether the writers like it or not. This is good for marketing. If you
go into any bookshop, a large pay-the-back bookshop, you'll see that they do

26:33.220 --> 26:42.980
this. They put it in separate areas. They market science fiction. They market
romance because they know that people are coming looking for that type of

26:42.980 --> 26:53.460
literature. A science fiction novel published as a mainstream work, unless it's
marvelously good, very well advertised, it's going to be lost. It'll be

26:53.460 --> 27:05.060
forgotten. It won't even be seen. And it certainly won't be reviewed by the
people who read science fiction. They won't tell each other. So for your own

27:05.060 --> 27:11.540
protection, for the author's protection, and for very sound economic reasons,
you do have to list it as a category.

27:19.040 --> 27:25.780
Some people say that science fiction is treated as a second-class form of
literature by critics, that it's unfairly neglected because it is a category

27:25.780 --> 27:35.520
literature. We asked Wolheim's opinion on that notion. Well, I am forced to
agree with those people. The mainstream literature

27:37.940 --> 27:52.300
is, in a sense, regarded as the literature by, let's say, professors of English
and by book critics. And things which are marked in a category style are looked

27:52.300 --> 28:01.960
down upon as hack writing. I see that happen, of course, living in New York. You
see the New York Times book, which was probably one of the most snob organs in

28:01.960 --> 28:10.680
the country, in which they will never review science fiction books if they can
help it. No matter what the critics think, if you like science fiction, you'll

28:10.680 --> 28:13.100
like what Donald A. Wollheim's DAW Books puts out.

This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

28:28.100 --> 28:28.860
Odessa, Texas.
