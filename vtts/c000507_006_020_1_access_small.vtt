00:01.060 --> 00:02.720
Okay, George, the tapes are rolling.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.540
Okay, you decided to be a writer at an early age.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.220
Why did you choose science fiction?

00:11.280 --> 00:17.940
It seemed to me that science fiction always seemed the natural kind of writing.

00:19.420 --> 00:28.460
I grew up reading science fiction and its materials and the kinds of possibilities that it opened up to myself as a reader

00:29.080 --> 00:40.460
seemed to belong peculiarly to this time as opposed to the feeling I got when I read Charles Dickens or the 19th century writers,

00:41.320 --> 00:45.640
Cy from Wells of course, who straddled both centuries.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.900
It seemed to belong uniquely to the 20th century.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.040
Of course, I didn't think about it that way.

00:51.340 --> 00:52.760
That came much later.

00:52.760 --> 01:01.340
But I think the instinctive reaction was that it was something that was for me and that it belonged to my time.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.780
When you were young, you were fairly active in fandom and you had a magazine called Epilogue.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.360
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

01:12.760 --> 01:14.300
Well, it ran for three issues.

01:14.740 --> 01:17.840
It started out as a publication called Viewpoint.

01:18.840 --> 01:23.200
Then the next two issues were called Epilogue Viewpoint.

01:24.260 --> 01:28.000
They were fairly elaborately produced magazines for their time.

01:28.900 --> 01:37.020
Photo offset with as much type setting fakery as you could bring about in a paste-up job.

01:38.160 --> 01:42.840
I think they can be seen in Sam Moskowitz's collection now.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.780
I don't even own the first two issues anymore.

01:47.320 --> 01:55.420
People like Buster Del Ray, Judith Merrill, Michael Morkock were published in the magazine.

01:56.500 --> 02:03.480
We were very militant about the future possibilities of a more literate science fiction.

02:03.760 --> 02:09.100
We were down on boroughs and Edward Eastman and people of that kind.

02:10.460 --> 02:17.840
Perhaps unfairly at the time, but we were very militant about things.

02:19.700 --> 02:28.580
I guess you might say that we were the American arm of the British New Waves.

02:28.800 --> 02:35.880
They seemed to find those of the British New Wave who wrote into us found Kindred Soles among us.

02:35.880 --> 02:42.780
Mike Morkock especially said it was just about the best American fanzine that he had ever read.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.520
That it set a high standard for discussion.

02:47.800 --> 03:01.920
Even somebody like Tom Borden, the American fan said that here is a fanzine that sets a standard higher than just about any other fanzine at the time.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.300
This is 1962-63.

03:06.100 --> 03:14.000
Other people who discovered it said that there was a science fiction and fantasy fanzine, not a fandom fanzine.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.160
There were maybe 200 copies of each one circulated.

03:19.220 --> 03:24.160
I was quite proud of it at the time, but when I came to college I'm afraid it just went by the wayside.

03:27.860 --> 03:32.200
I read that you met Arthur C. Clarke when you were quite young at a science fiction convention.

03:32.560 --> 03:40.600
No, I went to an American rocket society exposition at the Coliseum in New York.

03:41.480 --> 03:48.820
I was looking at some displays of spaceships and somebody said, oh, that's the Clark spaceship.

03:48.820 --> 03:54.500
It was a certain design, very much like the lunar excursion mine until later years.

03:55.920 --> 04:03.320
I turned to my right and kneeling on the floor looking at one of the pictures was Arthur C. Clarke.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.500
I just couldn't believe it.

04:06.400 --> 04:12.200
He later introduced me to Wernher von Braun and Willie May and some of the NASA people.

04:12.200 --> 04:18.260
I just was bowled over. I couldn't believe this had happened to me.

04:19.100 --> 04:24.680
He seemed very encouraging and very interested in what I had to say.

04:25.300 --> 04:29.040
It was very important. I'd read most of his books up to that time.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.760
You can imagine how I felt.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.540
Do you still correspond with Arthur C. Clarke?

04:39.680 --> 04:48.620
I had occasion to reprint some of his articles notably in Faster Than Light, which will be out in paper back next month, by the way.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.940
I've corresponded to him about macro life.

04:53.840 --> 05:03.820
I felt that his feeling that he has for, say, the solar system almost as if he were a regionalist of some kind,

05:03.920 --> 05:12.500
writing about his own backyard in the way that a southern writer might be a regionalist, the way the Faulkner was a regionalist,

05:12.500 --> 05:21.740
the special feeling that he has for the nature of the universe and for the natural realm in general.

05:22.860 --> 05:29.680
I always thought of Clarke as very much like Bradbury in his poetic sense.

05:31.080 --> 05:39.320
In nonfiction, there is a writer by the name of Lauren Hivesley who seems to combine Clarke's feelings for the universe

05:39.320 --> 05:42.820
with a kind of Bradbury writing approach.

05:43.960 --> 05:50.080
Bradbury, Clarke, Chad Oliver all seem to display this kind of authentic feeling for the universe.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.960
Still very dear to me, I'm afraid.

05:57.720 --> 06:07.080
Your background is in philosophy, so that gives you a bit of insight into the philosophy presented in science fiction that most of us don't have.

06:07.080 --> 06:15.400
In your opinion, has science fiction treated philosophy well? Has it developed anything new or is it mainly kind of a skin deep,

06:16.020 --> 06:17.780
lukewarm fashion that it's treated?

06:18.140 --> 06:26.920
Well, it's skin deep and this is surprising possibly to a literature that professes to be a literature of ideas

06:26.920 --> 06:35.320
and yet two areas, philosophy and cosmology, seem to be very poorly represented even though you would think that science fiction

06:35.320 --> 06:40.620
would cover these fields in a very deep fashion.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.460
But this is not really surprising.

06:42.980 --> 06:48.800
Most fiction, most literature does not use philosophy in any original sense.

06:49.740 --> 06:59.080
What I mean is that philosophy is usually derived from somewhere else, from some thinker and then is simply put to some use as background

06:59.080 --> 07:02.300
in a science fiction story or even in a contemporary novel.

07:04.920 --> 07:09.800
Most writers are not original thinkers in this regard.

07:09.900 --> 07:21.000
Even Stapledon, who is the most overtly philosophical of science fiction writers, is clearly a spinosa following the philosophy of spinosa kind of pantheism.

07:21.640 --> 07:26.260
There is not any original philosophizing going on.

07:26.260 --> 07:39.600
Of course, it would be ideal if you could have a science fiction writer who would be an original thinker and would present original thinking of a philosophical kind in his science fiction.

07:41.500 --> 07:55.660
But then you might say, why doesn't he just write a book of philosophy and then perhaps use the original philosophical material that he himself puts forward in his fiction.

07:55.660 --> 07:57.980
Lev does this to some degree.

07:58.100 --> 08:06.420
He's written philosophical works of enormous size and then used the ideas developed there for his science fiction.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.780
That's very, very rare.

08:10.320 --> 08:21.920
The kind of marketplace that science fiction has just doesn't demand that you become a philosopher or a scientist of any original stature to write science fiction.

08:21.920 --> 08:33.380
Fred Hoyle, Arthur Clark, Greg Benford are very good scientists of one kind or another.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.760
They also use that for science fiction.

08:37.020 --> 08:43.280
But I don't think they became scientists in order to write science fiction.

08:44.120 --> 08:49.780
That would be a level of ambition that has not been directed at this field.

08:53.020 --> 09:01.960
At one time you apparently came to the crossroads of whether to devote yourself to the academic life, presumably philosophy, or to become a full-time writer.

09:02.420 --> 09:06.200
What kind of factors influenced your decision to become a writer instead of an academic?

09:06.460 --> 09:08.840
Well, it had always been a tug of war.

09:09.140 --> 09:13.700
I went to college with the thought that it couldn't hurt.

09:15.240 --> 09:26.720
I do have a tremendous respect for the virtues of academia, the kind of honesty that goes into original work in a particular field.

09:28.460 --> 09:35.380
I still have a lot of regard for this despite the fact that individuals and individual institutions fall far short of it.

09:37.560 --> 09:44.980
Writing was a pursuit of a certain kind of beauty, the kind of beauty that you would find in music perhaps.

09:45.900 --> 09:53.860
It was always known in my philosophy department that I was being pulled into directions.

09:54.780 --> 10:04.460
When the crunch came and it was clear that there were very limited numbers of spaces in American philosophy of the academic source,

10:04.460 --> 10:14.320
I rebelled and I saw that there was really no need for being a philosopher in a university.

10:15.240 --> 10:20.200
They liked you to believe that you can only be a philosopher if you are associated with a university.

10:20.440 --> 10:24.080
Many philosophers in history have not been associated with universities.

10:25.220 --> 10:30.700
The universities now would like to think that they own philosophy just like the English department,

10:30.860 --> 10:34.720
think that they own English literature or literature in general.

10:35.020 --> 10:39.440
Without them, you are not a true believer.

10:40.700 --> 10:44.700
But I saw that you could perhaps go another route.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.660
I kind of like the independence of being a freelance writer.

10:48.660 --> 10:58.080
As long as it lasts, conceivably the market gets so bad that it would become impossible to have this kind of career be this kind of figure.

10:58.720 --> 10:59.320
I hope not.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.860
I want to throw in a new question here, George.

11:05.940 --> 11:13.060
I understand that you are also a graduate of the Clarion Science Fiction schools or groups or whatever.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.200
Did you find that a help? Did that really set you up?

11:17.200 --> 11:23.980
Well, 1968 rolled around and I was right at the crossroads whether to become a teaching assistant in philosophy

11:23.980 --> 11:29.180
or whether to bite the bullet and do something to become a writer.

11:31.360 --> 11:37.100
When Clarion popped up in the announcement, I said, I'll go.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.080
I got together the money and made the effort.

11:41.960 --> 11:55.920
But primarily it was an effort, it was a kind of cheerleading kind of effort where I went through a certain kind of procedure, a ritual, so to speak,

11:56.880 --> 12:07.340
to gain the encouragement from outside that this was possible, that it was more than just a pipe dream, that you could do this for real.

12:07.340 --> 12:15.320
And the primary influence of Clarion on me was that I went and I did the work assigned.

12:15.980 --> 12:21.460
I don't think I learned anything of a drastic kind that I didn't know already.

12:21.900 --> 12:27.200
But it just gave me the framework in which I could feel that it was going to be possible.

12:27.700 --> 12:30.600
I gained a lot from Fritz Lieber, who was one of my teachers.

12:31.560 --> 12:41.800
I met Judith Merrill, Damon Knight, Harlan Ellison, who provided a tremendous example of industriousness at that time.

12:41.980 --> 12:52.920
This was 1968, this was the first Clarion workshop, which also had Ed Bryant beside myself and Jim Sutherland and Evanda,

12:52.920 --> 13:03.700
not I'm sorry, Evelyn Leith, a few other people, Neil Shapiro, all of whom went on to write stories and novels.

13:04.540 --> 13:09.880
I think probably Bryant and myself are the best known from that year.

13:11.220 --> 13:21.480
It was important, but it was more of the kind of thing that you pull when you give a little kid a glass of colored water to drink,

13:21.880 --> 13:28.620
so that he'll be able to ride a bicycle and he simply believes you and rides the bicycle without falling off.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.580
But you see what I mean.

13:32.320 --> 13:32.860
Oh yeah.

13:35.600 --> 13:40.900
Let me add here one thing that's difficult for us when we're interviewing my phone is knowing exactly when you're finished,

13:40.920 --> 13:45.640
so sometimes there may be a pregnant pause between questions.

13:47.040 --> 13:53.840
Okay, you've been quoted as saying that in the last decade you've been too heavily influenced by the commercial aspects of science fiction.

13:54.160 --> 13:58.780
When you write a book or a short story, whom do you aim for as an audience?

13:59.860 --> 14:02.680
Well, I don't particularly aim for any audience.

14:03.060 --> 14:09.020
I simply aim to be clear and to communicate to any reader who can read fiction.

14:10.460 --> 14:15.420
The idea being that such a reader will understand what you have to say.

14:16.220 --> 14:23.300
What you're doing is you're forming an impression within the mind of a hypothetical intelligent reader

14:24.260 --> 14:33.260
in such a way that there'll be no question as to what you mean and what impression or what atmosphere you wish to create.

14:35.080 --> 14:42.680
I think I simply follow the idea of most writers that you have to communicate.

14:46.600 --> 14:51.240
At least one writer has told us that, face it, writers are entertainers.

14:51.240 --> 14:55.500
Do you have this view or at least a hybrid of this view and something else?

14:56.100 --> 15:00.560
Well, you have to understand what you mean by entertainment.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.540
I'm entertained by a great variety of things.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.080
I'm entertained by hard thinking.

15:06.560 --> 15:11.820
I'm entertained by poetry, by music, by serious theater.

15:13.740 --> 15:20.100
I believe that it's better to be capable of being entertained by a great variety of things.

15:20.100 --> 15:25.300
Now, many of these things are exactly the kind of things that most people do not find entertaining.

15:25.560 --> 15:28.400
They find them didactic or dull.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.240
And I think they're simply missing something.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.280
They are entertained by smaller range of things.

15:38.940 --> 15:45.160
In the past, you've been critical of science fiction as a field where writers can take the easy way out.

15:45.160 --> 15:51.220
Instead of coming up with something original, they just follow a formula and seem to be doing okay.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.560
Is this trend continuing, getting worse, getting better? What?

15:56.560 --> 16:02.440
Well, if you consider that science fiction has been anywhere between 10 and 15 percent of all fiction published,

16:03.540 --> 16:13.760
a great number, a great amount of it is a derivative built on predigested ideas and predigested plots.

16:13.760 --> 16:22.000
And a good example takes to the concept of space colonies or the L5, the society type of thing.

16:24.300 --> 16:29.100
It's very often simply been used as just another place to have an adventure of some kind,

16:29.260 --> 16:35.820
or a place to set a murder mystery or a suspense story of some kind or another.

16:35.820 --> 16:43.620
Predigestion seems to be the operative method of the copiers.

16:43.920 --> 16:48.540
Something comes in and it's slightly new and it's not used for itself.

16:48.740 --> 16:55.080
It's used as just another place to have another barbaric adventure or whatever.

16:56.020 --> 17:00.200
It's easier to do this than to be original in each and every case.

17:00.200 --> 17:06.540
I'm afraid that like many other writers, I wrote what I was most influenced by.

17:07.300 --> 17:15.220
But as you go on, you realize that quite possibly there is a way of doing things that is a little more original than that.

17:17.880 --> 17:23.780
Do writers get to the point where they have a choice of following recipes and guaranteeing money

17:23.780 --> 17:29.160
or deciding to try something new and risking the fact that maybe this isn't going to work out?

17:30.440 --> 17:36.260
Well, the fact is that most science fiction has sort of built in sales potential.

17:36.940 --> 17:42.420
A science fiction book will sell between 30 or 50,000 copies no matter who wrote it.

17:43.560 --> 17:50.240
This is unfortunate. Most of the best writers of science fiction however become their own genres.

17:50.720 --> 17:55.560
Clarke, Gazzemop, Heinlein are genres unto themselves within the genre.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.020
People will buy the name no matter what they write.

17:59.660 --> 18:06.100
This is also unfortunate but it is a sign of some progress on the part of the writer.

18:07.200 --> 18:12.140
I think even if you write a fairly experimental kind of book like Macro-Ike,

18:12.200 --> 18:16.500
because of the built-in potential there will be a certain number of readers who will buy it.

18:16.500 --> 18:22.380
There will be a smaller number of people who actually buy it because they are interested in that kind of thing.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.520
Maybe their tastes will be widened by it.

18:27.480 --> 18:31.500
You really can't tell. You just have to do what you really want to do.

18:31.580 --> 18:37.080
You can't simply write to fill a niche in the market.

18:38.420 --> 18:42.680
That's what strikes me as being very cynical in many writers.

18:42.680 --> 18:47.200
They do aim for a particular audience and they aim to deliver a certain product

18:47.200 --> 18:49.000
and they don't seem to have any other ambitions.

18:49.520 --> 18:54.880
This would be fine if some of these writers were not capable of more,

18:55.060 --> 18:57.540
in which case they are betraying their own abilities.

18:59.100 --> 19:06.400
This kind of comment on my part sounds perhaps very noble to many other writers

19:06.400 --> 19:10.780
and very idealistic and they sort of shake their heads in the way that

19:11.620 --> 19:13.980
Claggett shook his head at Billy Budd's innocence.

19:16.760 --> 19:20.740
But that kind of attitude comes out of the environment in which they move.

19:20.940 --> 19:26.760
I think you can create for yourself an ambitious environment in which you will produce,

19:27.360 --> 19:32.260
or at least have a shot at producing something that will be closer to what you are capable of doing.

19:35.020 --> 19:37.780
Let's bring up the topic of critics in science fiction.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.240
There don't seem to be a lot of good ones, if there ever were.

19:41.960 --> 19:47.000
What do you think as an author that critics should look for when they're reviewing a work?

19:48.580 --> 19:53.620
Well, they should primarily, if I would make any advice to would-be critics,

19:53.880 --> 19:59.680
is not to try to rewrite the book for the author and to hoist the author by his own guitar

19:59.680 --> 20:00.880
to not that of the critic.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.960
Most critics, I'm afraid, are self-appointed.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.960
It's very easy to simply appoint yourself a reviewer or critic

20:07.960 --> 20:14.260
and start publishing criticism and then you acquire a few credits and you do more.

20:15.920 --> 20:19.840
It's something that I don't believe that young writers should do at all.

20:21.720 --> 20:29.560
I did a lot of criticism when I was just beginning and I don't think I acquitted myself very honorably

20:29.560 --> 20:36.540
at all. You tend to overpray on the one hand and you tend to ignore things that you don't like.

20:38.920 --> 20:44.880
Criticism is something that should be a very small part of any literature.

20:45.640 --> 20:50.860
There are some good critics, but that's a career in itself and ultimately a good critic

20:50.860 --> 20:54.180
is a person who writes a kind of literature.

20:55.640 --> 21:05.140
Edmund Wilson or Lionel Trilling or people of that caliber are very rare.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.260
Science fiction has no good critics.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.440
After Damon Knight, James Blisch gave up.

21:10.080 --> 21:14.900
Alfred Bester was literally held it out of reviewing because he was so hard on everything.

21:16.140 --> 21:20.840
The people who criticize now are people simply looking to make a name for themselves

21:20.840 --> 21:24.660
by writing reviews of better writers' works.

21:28.700 --> 21:33.120
In your background you were a fan, a writer, a critic.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.880
Now let's talk a little bit about being an editor.

21:37.280 --> 21:45.660
How did you get involved in editing and does editing, is that practice that the expense of maybe not doing as much writing yourself?

21:46.660 --> 21:52.120
Well I think both good writers edit because they wish to influence the field.

21:52.920 --> 21:58.200
They're curious to see what they can elicit from other writers.

21:58.740 --> 22:07.660
I'm talking primarily about original anthologies or magazine, original magazines which publish new stories.

22:08.420 --> 22:11.560
You do it because you have an idea of how it should be done.

22:11.560 --> 22:16.920
John Campbell once said when I edit I am a hundred different writers.

22:17.200 --> 22:22.020
He would make suggestions to many of his writers and they would follow through.

22:22.720 --> 22:30.180
Many of the novels with Heinlein and Vasselbaum and others were originally suggestions made by John Campbell.

22:31.100 --> 22:37.500
Then each of these writers of course carries out the idea in a very different way.

22:37.500 --> 22:43.380
So it's a Campbell meant by saying that I'm a hundred different writers when I edit and I'm only one writer when I write.

22:43.940 --> 22:46.640
But that's perhaps a little too easy.

22:46.860 --> 22:55.180
I want to edit when I do and I don't want to do it all the time to influence how science fiction is written

22:55.180 --> 23:02.160
and to help produce the kinds of works that will set a different example.

23:02.160 --> 23:07.140
I had only limited opportunities to do this.

23:07.320 --> 23:11.020
I've edited five anthologies, some of them original, some of them not.

23:14.480 --> 23:20.980
I think they reflect the kind of science fiction that I would like to see written.

23:21.840 --> 23:31.320
Although if I really hold to the standard I would have to say that however well these books have done, they are failures according to my outlook.

23:31.320 --> 23:41.460
Ultimately you have to accept as an editor the best that you can get and that may not reach the level that you desire.

23:44.020 --> 23:49.640
Who broaches the subject of a book which is to be edited? Do you get called by the publisher and he says...

23:49.640 --> 23:55.280
In each case I originated the concept of the anthology.

23:57.080 --> 24:11.020
If I was doing it in collaboration with somebody else then the other editor and I put this out on the market and a publisher who was interested would simply offer a contract.

24:13.020 --> 24:14.900
Did you ever meet John Campbell?

24:14.900 --> 24:19.400
Yes, I spent six hours in his office I think it was in 1970.

24:20.160 --> 24:24.140
Just before a year or so before his death I don't remember the exact date.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.840
It was quite an experience.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.700
Let's switch now to your...

24:32.700 --> 24:34.080
You'd like me to talk about Campbell?

24:34.260 --> 24:36.320
Yes please do. I would welcome that.

24:36.320 --> 24:41.420
I think I can sum up Campbell's attitudes.

24:41.700 --> 24:46.240
He was sitting behind his desk puffing away at his cigarette holder.

24:48.500 --> 24:54.480
Very anxious to have a discussion that would not be him agreeing with me or me agreeing with him.

24:55.300 --> 25:00.960
He picked up a copy I think of Orbit by Damon Knight and a copy of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

25:02.200 --> 25:08.620
The interesting thing is the writers in these two books write beautifully but they don't think very much.

25:09.280 --> 25:16.840
He said the great problem with science fiction is you have people who write beautifully and don't think and you have people who think gorgeously and can't write.

25:18.760 --> 25:29.340
It impressed me because I've always believed that the secret to writing science fiction was to combine a whole set of virtues in one writer.

25:29.340 --> 25:32.440
It seems to be a very difficult thing to do.

25:32.740 --> 25:49.540
However, I do believe that these various virtues that go to make good science fiction thinking and writing well for example can be developed in intelligent writers in the same way that people develop theirs.

25:49.700 --> 25:52.460
The strength of various fingers when they practice the piano.

25:52.800 --> 25:57.600
But they don't start early, they don't do it consciously, they don't really try.

25:57.600 --> 26:04.420
They settle for what actually sells and then it gets published and then they don't work beyond that point.

26:07.260 --> 26:16.240
I was very impressed with Campbell and he valued disagreement above easy agreement.

26:16.660 --> 26:19.980
He told me if you agree with me I'll change my mind.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.640
Great teacher in one respect.

26:25.480 --> 26:32.560
He still has quite an influence on the field which I know some people don't consider all that in that much of a positive fashion.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.920
Do you think that his influence was positive overall?

26:36.500 --> 26:42.480
I think it was positive and I think his disciples do not make the best case for him.

26:42.480 --> 26:57.420
They do not represent his ideas and I think that it's the worst of John Campbell's effect on writers and on the publishing of science fiction that has come in for deserved attack.

26:58.460 --> 27:04.340
The kind of interpretation of Campbell that makes sense out of Campbell's approach.

27:04.340 --> 27:15.660
I think Greg Benford put it, Campbell basically wanted broader horizons and a deeper sense of humanity in his writers.

27:16.440 --> 27:20.560
And that's the kind of defense that is not made of John W. Campbell.

27:20.700 --> 27:30.680
I think that John Campbell's legitimate heirs are people like Ursula Gwynne, Gregory Benford, perhaps Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, Gene Wolfe.

27:30.680 --> 27:46.740
The writers who bring a sense of human character into an area of broader horizons in ideas and considering the future of science and technology and considering many of the softer sciences.

27:47.340 --> 27:57.460
I think those are the people who defend Campbell along the lines of, you know, let's have more hard science and engineering in our fiction.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.700
Don't really understand what he was trying to do.

28:02.000 --> 28:11.440
I think it was James Blish who said that when you say hard science fiction, what he meant by it is hard science fiction across the board.

28:11.440 --> 28:21.200
Hard thinking, fine writing, hard characterization, that unity of values that I alluded to before.

28:22.260 --> 28:24.580
That's what Campbell really pointed to.

28:24.640 --> 28:33.600
And of course he failed to bring about this kind of science fiction, although he had some success.

28:33.600 --> 28:37.520
Anybody would have to fail to some degree.

28:38.560 --> 28:46.880
But I think the people who defend Campbell are usually those who turn off the literary or ambitious writer.

28:50.920 --> 28:54.520
Now let's change topics and discuss your individual works.

28:55.380 --> 29:01.340
Our first exposure to you in novel form was the Omega Point, which we now know is the middle of a trilogy.

29:01.340 --> 29:05.220
What was it intended to be when you first wrote it?

29:06.260 --> 29:13.320
Well, I originally intended it to be a colorful, ice and stiny space opera.

29:14.100 --> 29:21.460
Anyone who's seen the film, Sergei Ice, is probably like Alexander Netski, or Ivan the Terrible, would see what I mean by that.

29:21.460 --> 29:29.360
The characters were colorful, intense, filled with characters who were always on edge.

29:30.500 --> 29:39.880
I simply wanted to carry out a certain kind of aesthetic wish, and I'm afraid that I fell into a certain kind of science fiction.

29:41.270 --> 29:48.460
The book has been called a Metacysical Space Opera by Peter Nichols with Science Fiction and Psychopedia.

29:48.460 --> 29:49.800
And it is that.

29:50.540 --> 30:00.380
And I don't think that it's a departure for me in any way. I think it was what I could do at the time.

30:01.000 --> 30:07.720
There is a fair amount of my background in the story.

30:07.900 --> 30:14.020
I suppose if I wanted to be psychoanalytic, I came out of a ruined Europe.

30:14.640 --> 30:22.220
I grew up in England, in New York, and I suppose the main character is also the survivor of a destroyed people.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.680
So it's sort of allegorical, I suppose.

30:26.460 --> 30:28.120
This happened before in science fiction.

30:28.300 --> 30:37.380
There's a book called The Falling Torch by Alges Budris, which is a thinly disguised story about a Lithuanian exile,

30:37.380 --> 30:44.520
going back to leader revolt against his people, the pressers.

30:45.360 --> 30:51.880
Budris is an exile also from Soviet-dominated Lithuania.

30:52.840 --> 30:58.140
I suppose you could say that the Omega Point dealt with themes of this kind.

30:59.520 --> 31:07.880
I see it as the ghosts of the Hitlerian War, you know, walking through a metaphysical space opera.

31:08.940 --> 31:12.900
And in the revenge theme, I suppose, there is a kind of strength.

31:13.120 --> 31:18.900
The book went into seven, eight foreign editions and did quite well in its original paperback.

31:19.640 --> 31:28.580
But I think that when I finally produced the final three volumes, they're produced as one book by my publishers.

31:29.660 --> 31:39.160
It will be considerably improved, but I think it will have the same colorful space opera kind of background.

31:39.860 --> 31:44.760
It'll never be better than a certain kind of genre of science fiction.

31:45.440 --> 31:52.140
I don't mind that kind of science fiction, but I wish it were better done than it has been in the past.

31:55.280 --> 32:00.260
It's going to be republished. It's going to be in an improved version.

32:00.860 --> 32:08.160
Well, in effect, the three volumes, Ashes of the Star, the Omega Point, and I think the third part will be called Mirror of Science,

32:08.320 --> 32:09.820
although that's not quite certain yet.

32:09.820 --> 32:23.020
All three volumes will have been rewritten from scratch, in effect, to produce the kind of overall intention that I have for the books.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.560
They're really one book. That's what they are.

32:28.720 --> 32:34.240
Why do you choose to rewrite old works instead of just laying them aside and going on to something else?

32:34.240 --> 32:44.100
Well, this is only going to happen twice. The middle Omega book I rewrote, but that's because there is a larger work to which it belongs.

32:44.840 --> 32:51.000
It's a question of making the work even throughout to the quality of writing.

32:52.000 --> 32:59.540
I think that although the original Omega Point had a certain kind of energy, it was a very young book.

32:59.540 --> 33:04.900
I don't think it did as well as it should have for that theme.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.380
It's unfinished business. That's really what it is.

33:10.620 --> 33:15.540
The same thing with Starweb, which is the first of three volumes.

33:15.680 --> 33:21.600
So I can't just leave the first volume as it is and do the other two volumes. The first one would stick out as a sore thumb.

33:21.600 --> 33:32.260
In time, these six books, I suppose, will be out as two books, each one in three parts, but they are essentially one work.

33:32.580 --> 33:40.280
So you have two books total. So the question of finishing up old business, I'm not rewriting old books for the sake of rewriting old books.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.980
And I'll probably never do this again.

33:41.980 --> 33:47.660
The trick is to write it as well as you deserve the first time.

33:47.820 --> 33:56.400
And I think I've done that with other works. I'll never rewrite the stories in my story collection, for example, or rewrite MacroLife.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.500
They don't need that.

34:02.500 --> 34:11.120
A catchy thing about the Omega Point and the sequel, Lashes and Stars, is that you have all sorts of quotes interspersed among the chapters.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.600
Do you keep a notebook of quotes? Do you purposely look for them? How do you remember them all?

34:17.600 --> 34:21.600
Well, I do have a notebook in which I write down things that strike me.

34:23.940 --> 34:34.400
And they started out primarily as springboards of theme and action for various parts of the Omega Trilogy.

34:34.840 --> 34:40.200
And after a while I said, well, why not put them in anyway?

34:40.200 --> 34:50.300
And the response I've had, I probably should leave them in, although I think that in the one volume edition they'll be set in very small type at the beginning of each chapter.

34:51.280 --> 35:04.020
I've been of two minds over this, whether to leave it out or not. I don't know what they add to the overall book, but perhaps they add a kind of thoughtfulness that would be otherwise missing.

35:06.540 --> 35:09.160
As an aside, I definitely agree. They do.

35:09.420 --> 35:14.380
I was very happy to hear that from somebody else besides myself.

35:16.280 --> 35:23.240
Okay, Starlet was one of the few pretty good laser books. How did you get convinced to write a laser book?

35:23.240 --> 35:29.200
Well, I was with many other writers of the 70s who came to prominence in the 70s.

35:29.240 --> 35:41.620
Roger O would contact at least 100 writers. Other writers would have written quite a few stories for Roger or Barry Maltzberg, Gene Wolfe, Phillip Palmer,

35:41.620 --> 35:46.340
or anyone you can think of. Just go look in your content over at Theography.

35:46.660 --> 35:53.280
You'll see how many writers wrote stories for Roger's endless pit of demands.

35:54.500 --> 36:00.700
I was asked to write one of the laser books, and I didn't concoct the laser book.

36:00.800 --> 36:07.360
I simply submitted a book that I was planning to write anyway, and it went over.

36:07.360 --> 36:15.640
I regret that I had to write it in such a short period of time, which is why I've rewritten it.

36:17.020 --> 36:27.740
But the proof of perhaps the book's quality is that it has gone from a laser paperback to a volume one of a double-day trilogy in hardcover.

36:27.920 --> 36:33.160
Very few books make the passage from paperback into hardcover. It goes the other way, usually.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.780
You had at least one other association with Roger L. Wood.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.820
I think I wrote about 12 stories for him, all total.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.020
Roger L. Wood is...

36:45.020 --> 36:50.380
They were stories that I was writing anyway, and he simply said, OK, I'll commission it.

36:51.020 --> 36:54.340
As soon as the story was ready, it turns out that he bought it.

36:57.100 --> 37:01.760
Roger L. Wood is often reviled now for various reasons.

37:01.760 --> 37:05.480
Do you think that he had an overall positive effect on the field?

37:06.260 --> 37:11.320
Well, the problem with Roger L. Wood goes two ways.

37:11.920 --> 37:16.200
One, science fiction writers are generally irreligious.

37:20.700 --> 37:25.160
They want to see what they write published.

37:26.760 --> 37:37.320
Roger was a religious person. I think he's a Baptist who had some very strong ideas as to what science fiction should be.

37:37.800 --> 37:43.600
Although, if you look at what he bought, he bought about the same kind of thing that almost anybody else would buy.

37:43.600 --> 37:56.320
His positive effect is that he gave a lot of life and a lot of living to many, many writers who would not have been able to write and publish as much.

37:56.900 --> 38:03.580
The problem is that he brought out the worst in many writers.

38:03.800 --> 38:11.820
He had such a large need for fiction that he bought just about everything that most writers could produce.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.120
Even works that he would reject.

38:16.380 --> 38:20.780
Later, when an opportunity would present itself, he would buy the work.

38:21.260 --> 38:24.900
He would get back to you and say, you know that story I rejected six months ago?

38:25.060 --> 38:28.840
I think I have a place where I could use it and then he would buy it.

38:29.140 --> 38:37.820
The difficulty with this is that no matter what editor was doing what Roger did, they would have this problem.

38:37.820 --> 38:41.240
Namely, that there is a limited amount of first-rate material.

38:42.020 --> 38:53.180
If you have certain numbers of pages to fill, he had about 70 anthologies to his credit, I think, with various magazine editing stints.

38:53.940 --> 39:00.160
No matter who was doing what Roger did, they would have to fill those pages up, especially if they'd signed contracts.

39:00.880 --> 39:05.160
Eventually, the criterion became that of minimal professionalism.

39:05.960 --> 39:10.860
If something was professional and readable and if it fit the particular anthology, it went.

39:12.260 --> 39:19.600
Roger ran up against the difficulty of getting work at a high level in a short period of time.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.760
It just can't be done.

39:23.860 --> 39:27.080
It's partially his fault and that he provided the opportunity,

39:27.080 --> 39:35.040
but I think it's also the fault of the field that the level of writing and ambition was so low

39:35.040 --> 39:37.860
that we were producing at this level.

39:38.020 --> 39:42.000
Most of the stories he bought were not concocted for him.

39:42.680 --> 39:47.060
They were stories that these writers were writing or had in their trunk.

39:48.220 --> 39:54.620
Many writers sold him all their trunk of material that had not been published elsewhere.

39:54.620 --> 39:57.540
Is that clear enough on that?

39:58.380 --> 39:59.980
That's great. That's what I wanted to know.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.880
We'll ask one more question, then we'll flip our tape.

40:05.760 --> 40:06.740
Your collection of...

40:06.740 --> 40:13.820
Before we just go on, I'd like to say that there are half a dozen Elwood anthologies to that are outstanding

40:13.820 --> 40:23.080
and that will probably deserve to remain in print the continuum series of four books of EPAAH

40:23.980 --> 40:26.240
Showcase, just to name the best.

40:31.720 --> 40:35.220
Okay. Your collection, The Monadic Universe, appeared.

40:36.240 --> 40:41.600
Three of the stories that I came across in there, the history machine, the Cleometrican,

40:41.600 --> 40:48.940
assuming that's the correct pronunciation, and Stance of Splendor showed quite a divergence in style

40:48.940 --> 40:50.560
from the other stories that you'd written.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.720
They were reminiscent of new wave style stories.

40:53.540 --> 40:56.040
Were you experimenting with your style in these stories?

40:56.840 --> 41:03.660
Well, when I started out, I corresponded with people like Michael Moore-Cock and various other writers in England

41:03.660 --> 41:07.000
and I published quite a few stories in New World.

41:08.160 --> 41:19.920
I didn't try to particularly write for that market, but I felt that here were possibilities that I was not following through in other stories

41:19.920 --> 41:21.500
and I was very happy to have them published.

41:22.280 --> 41:29.580
The history machine, for example, was originally commissioned for another anthology from Valentine

41:30.860 --> 41:34.920
and when that materialized, Michael Moore-Cock bought it.

41:37.000 --> 41:37.480
Thank you.
