00:02.600 --> 00:07.520
And since your voice level is there and everything, then just talk as you have been.

00:08.480 --> 00:14.320
You are a, from what I can gather, a Donald Walheim discovery.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.600
There have been a few other of those, but with the Dahl books, that's where your novels

00:18.600 --> 00:19.080
were published.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.400
How did you first get published by Donald Walheim?

00:21.940 --> 00:25.280
Well, apparently I'm one of these fortunate real few.

00:25.280 --> 00:34.840
I just sent out the little book in your basic brown paper wrapping to as many, one after

00:34.840 --> 00:40.720
the other, to as many people as I could find in the writer's market.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.200
And he was the first one to show interest.

00:46.080 --> 00:52.440
And he sent, you know, he sent me a questionnaire to find out who it was and what it was doing

00:52.440 --> 00:56.700
and said, you know, of course, this isn't any good sign of selling.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.640
Then I'd written the second one in the series.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.320
And I sent that off to him.

01:04.640 --> 01:11.700
And since he decided, I suppose, that I was going to keep on producing, he sent me, bless

01:11.700 --> 01:21.520
his heart, two typewritten pages, single spaced, with from top to bottom completely marvelous

01:22.820 --> 01:24.620
criticism of the book as was.

01:24.860 --> 01:28.720
So I rewrote it for the night time and sent it back and he bought it.

01:30.380 --> 01:33.400
Was this the first science fiction book that you had written?

01:33.560 --> 01:34.680
This first book I'd written.

01:35.740 --> 01:39.380
How did you come to be a writer then and why science fiction of all things?

01:41.360 --> 01:45.180
Well, for the first, I've been teaching for a number of years.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.400
And I'm also an artist.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.060
I draw a lot.

01:51.160 --> 02:00.620
And I was much more interested in painting and drawing for my first years than it was in writing.

02:01.600 --> 02:10.920
But I gradually came to see that while I have a gift for rendering, I can do quite good individual objects.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.380
I don't have any field for design.

02:14.360 --> 02:21.200
And I wasn't willing to take the trouble to get work for that field.

02:22.180 --> 02:25.360
So I decided to remain in very much an amateur as a painter.

02:27.600 --> 02:37.260
But having drawn that conclusion and being in a situation where I needed to get out,

02:37.400 --> 02:41.240
I was about ready to bang my head against the walls.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.840
I know one of your examples of teacher burnout.

02:44.680 --> 02:51.720
And so I started writing as a way of breaking away from the job I was in.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.060
And science fiction?

02:55.200 --> 02:58.860
Well, because I've always loved it, because I thought I could write it.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.740
And it is an awful lot of fun making up worlds.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.440
It is an awful lot of fun.

03:04.620 --> 03:05.580
Basically that's it.

03:05.580 --> 03:24.260
I need the distance between me and the actual nitty-gritty reality, the sandpapering, the dominance of real things and real people to be able to create.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.860
This seems like a logical place to ask this question, although I was going to ask it at the end.

03:33.460 --> 03:37.200
The covers, since you are an artist, still are an artist.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.180
I guess it's not good to say you were an artist.

03:39.760 --> 03:45.140
The covers on the books are, I guess, in kind of the T&A school.

03:45.820 --> 03:49.800
And I realized that probably the art director feels that's what sells books.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.940
But are you satisfied with the covers?

03:52.120 --> 03:53.880
Do you think they could have been done a little better?

03:54.600 --> 03:55.280
Very nice.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.300
Several of them I rather like.

03:57.540 --> 04:03.660
Some of them I don't care for that much.

04:04.200 --> 04:08.880
But, well, Don Wilhunt is his own art director and he has his own distinctive taste.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.800
I haven't really been concerned that much with the covers.

04:15.620 --> 04:19.340
There hasn't been one that I absolutely loathe.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.840
I mean, you could stand them.

04:21.400 --> 04:28.500
I think some of the covers that sell, Don seems to know that pretty well.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.960
But they'll sell the first book.

04:31.080 --> 04:34.460
But I think it's up to me to sell the second and the third and the fourth.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.240
If they like what I write, it doesn't matter what cover you put on it.

04:38.960 --> 04:39.360
Okay.

04:39.940 --> 04:46.180
Now I'd like to explore the Diadem series since there have now been seven Diadem books published.

04:48.100 --> 04:52.240
So, since this is a nice long series, it's very enjoyable when I might add.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.520
How much of it did you have planned in advance?

04:54.800 --> 04:58.000
I mean, there's a lot of things that have happened and you must have written the first book.

04:58.260 --> 05:04.100
Could you telescope all the way down to the end and see where you wanted to take Alitas or is she developed along with you?

05:05.580 --> 05:07.060
Well, yes and no.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.040
It's like just about every one of the novels is right.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.680
I know where I'm starting and I know my characters and I know my world.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.460
In this case, it's a series of worlds.

05:17.060 --> 05:20.520
And I know where I'm going, but how I'm going to get there develops.

05:21.460 --> 05:23.140
I don't think I can write any other way.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.020
I mean, it would be boring if I knew everything before I started.

05:26.920 --> 05:32.040
For example, in Star Hunters, one of the secondary leads in it,

05:33.280 --> 05:37.760
the woman who was more or less a toy or plaything,

05:37.900 --> 05:42.340
the wife of one of the other secondary leads in the subplot,

05:43.200 --> 05:46.840
is only supposed to be in there for about three pages or so.

05:48.020 --> 05:52.260
But I suddenly got very interested in her or she got me interested in her

05:52.260 --> 05:55.380
and she began to take over and she became a very important part of the book.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.500
And this is totally, totally unexpected.

05:59.040 --> 06:06.340
In the beginning, I meant to have Alitas reach her, find her mother and her family in...

06:07.220 --> 06:09.320
Well, about the same as the number of books.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.920
I think there'll be about nine in all.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.900
I just finished one and turned it in.

06:14.020 --> 06:15.040
I think that's the eighth.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.200
And the next one will probably be the other last in that particular series,

06:20.540 --> 06:22.480
dealing with Alitas as the main character.

06:25.480 --> 06:34.060
Each book, I hope, shows makes Alitas a little bit more aware of who she is

06:34.060 --> 06:37.320
and what she really wants rather than what she thought she wanted.

06:37.320 --> 06:42.880
And in the end, she's going to end up, I hope,

06:43.060 --> 06:48.000
satisfied with where she is working and living in that place for a while anyway.

06:49.460 --> 06:53.220
So I knew I was going to have her to find her mother and her mother's world,

06:54.100 --> 06:59.960
how I was going to get there, depending upon the inspiration and the desperation of the moment.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.600
Alitas is quite an interesting character.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.360
How much of Alitas is you?

07:08.720 --> 07:14.360
Well, to be honest, every character in there, in every one of the books, good and bad, is me.

07:14.980 --> 07:20.060
Because I'm the only real resource I have for in-depth knowledge of characters,

07:20.180 --> 07:22.120
but she's also a lot of other people I've known.

07:23.900 --> 07:26.880
She's... Her qualities are...

07:26.880 --> 07:32.300
There's some women executives I've known, some teachers that I have known, some kids.

07:35.400 --> 07:39.780
Mostly, most of them are very competent people I've known that go into her,

07:39.860 --> 07:46.660
as well as my... anything incompetent or asinine, or the kind of thing that makes you bite your nails

07:46.660 --> 07:48.620
when you think about it, that's probably me.

07:50.480 --> 07:54.620
The first few books in the series really accented the diet,

07:54.740 --> 07:58.080
and of course the reader has to gain an understanding of what that is.

07:58.080 --> 08:04.020
But as the books progress, there is less and less said about how it functions and that sort of thing.

08:04.640 --> 08:08.200
So that was modified. I guess that's the nice thing about a series.

08:08.340 --> 08:12.240
You don't have to go back and explain every time what the point is here, folks.

08:12.860 --> 08:20.820
Yeah. Well, I also am thinking of the series as my workshop in education and writing.

08:21.820 --> 08:25.360
And the concepts I might have had in the beginning...

08:25.360 --> 08:32.060
I'm not going to stick with them. I'll modify the vast necessary as I learn more about my craft.

08:36.960 --> 08:44.880
More and more, in the last books, I hope the character of the people who are trapped in the diet is coming through.

08:45.700 --> 08:53.820
And as they come out, or achieve, or re-embodied, or whatever you want to call it,

08:55.040 --> 09:00.400
they become more and more real to me and more important than the diet in itself.

09:01.180 --> 09:06.680
Also, I said before that I was in a situation where I was really banging my head against the wall.

09:07.860 --> 09:14.100
I was teaching English, you know, and while this is very important, there were so many things happening to my kids.

09:14.660 --> 09:22.940
I guess I got too involved with them that I was totally helpless to alleviate things that...

09:23.480 --> 09:28.940
you know, with the pressures on them, the wounds that they got from them, with the world around them.

09:29.640 --> 09:34.740
That I was just absolutely useless in helping them live through.

09:35.500 --> 09:48.120
Only I created perhaps a character that was, in the end, a little bit too powerful, too able to go to...

09:48.120 --> 09:56.300
Well, magic are way out of things, so I had to create problems for her and help her come to an understanding of the limitations of power.

09:56.760 --> 10:04.700
Which I guess is one of the one of the themes in... if there are themes in what I'm writing.

10:05.980 --> 10:11.920
Yeah, I enjoy the aspect in that she discovers the power in the first few books, and then she's comfortable with it,

10:11.920 --> 10:16.180
and then she uses it, and she's not discovering new things about it all the time,

10:16.200 --> 10:21.220
other than that we get to know the people trapped in the Diadem much better.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.860
I guess I should ask you here, how did Aletus evolve?

10:26.080 --> 10:32.300
Did you conceive of Aletus and then the Diadem, or did the idea of the Diadem hit you, and then Aletus is the character that naturally arose?

10:32.640 --> 10:35.040
Well, Aletus was the character, first of all.

10:36.840 --> 10:44.880
Actually, the first image that hit me was that first page of the first book.

10:45.840 --> 10:54.300
I just got this feeling for something suddenly, and...

10:55.560 --> 11:06.660
Ranking into the world that she knew, the crash of the ship of the thief, he was also one of the first characters that came up with.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.080
I could see him in his flight.

11:10.080 --> 11:15.040
Well, I see these things... you know, once I get to know them, they're...

11:15.040 --> 11:16.620
I'm a very visual person there.

11:17.820 --> 11:20.860
This little movie screen in the front of my head that goes through.

11:20.860 --> 11:31.020
But those are the things that came, first of all, the picture of the thief in flight, I didn't know what he had stolen,

11:31.820 --> 11:39.860
the crashing on the world, I didn't know what that crash meant, and slowly building up complications.

11:40.460 --> 11:41.380
I like complications.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.300
Yes, you do, from the writing.

11:46.540 --> 11:51.060
I want to talk about a couple of things in the books that caught my eyes.

11:51.200 --> 11:51.660
I read them.

11:51.980 --> 11:57.400
One thing in La Marcos, which I read right after my daughter was born,

11:57.560 --> 12:03.520
and I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Aletus and her son when he was a baby,

12:03.600 --> 12:08.840
because I had a baby at the same time and could see how accurate that was, and I was really amazed at that.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.240
And then that's the book.

12:10.300 --> 12:16.100
You kind of use the technique of leaving us up in the air at the end where she had been captured by the...

12:16.100 --> 12:18.700
I was going to ask you to pronounce what she had been captured by.

12:19.140 --> 12:26.100
I never could decide, but I was particularly taken with the descriptions of the relationship between the mother and the baby at the time.

12:26.280 --> 12:34.840
Well, just a few months before this, my sister had had her first son, and I'd been there, you know, to...

12:34.840 --> 12:37.680
The first time I'd ever been around a baby, that's little.

12:40.420 --> 12:45.680
And I helped her take care of the baby a bit, and she nursed him, of course.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.840
And, well, you know, it's just a...

12:55.120 --> 12:59.160
Everything that we know can be expanded into other things.

12:59.160 --> 13:06.620
Like, I like... I don't know if this will sound up or down or not, but I like small furry animals.

13:07.740 --> 13:12.320
And I could see that in a very fundamental way.

13:12.520 --> 13:16.500
My feeling for small furry animals could be applied to...

13:16.500 --> 13:24.340
I'd love to pat and hold and, you know, that kind of thing, could be applied to a mother and her child,

13:25.080 --> 13:28.320
so that I knew that part of it from the inside and from the outside.

13:28.620 --> 13:31.460
I saw how my sister and her baby were relating.

13:33.460 --> 13:39.400
I figured... I am glad to hear that it was from observation, because I felt so helpless at the time.

13:40.340 --> 13:43.540
And, of course, my wife knew more than I did, but I really did.

13:45.520 --> 13:53.160
In Maeve, and correct me if I'm pronouncing these wrongs, a lot of these words I've never pronounced out loud, it's always mentally...

13:53.680 --> 13:56.220
I really feel that I'm cooperating with my readers.

13:56.440 --> 14:04.160
And anybody... I have my own vision of what Alitas looks like and all the characters look like, and I have my own way of pronouncing them.

14:05.020 --> 14:09.980
Maeve is, you know, quite as good as any of them. That's how I always call it.

14:10.040 --> 14:14.040
But, anyway, I figured that anyone who reads it can pronounce it any way they like.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.740
Okay, here, here.

14:16.780 --> 14:21.660
Okay, in Maeve, Alitas runs into Gray, who figures heavily in a couple of other books.

14:21.660 --> 14:29.280
And he's the company man. And that was an interesting transition for me to see her as feeling as though she weren't outlawed and hated the company.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.320
And then she became part of the company.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.240
Is that something that occurred to you later on in the series?

14:36.640 --> 14:42.120
No, I guess, to be honest, this is one of my prejudices coming out.

14:42.120 --> 14:46.480
But I never saw the hunters as a company as such.

14:46.860 --> 15:09.380
I saw them more as an association of individuals, a very, very primidana individual, in a lot of ways, so that they don't get together with this sort of corporate consciousness that I felt in many of the big companies.

15:11.700 --> 15:18.680
So, in a sense, she's never been reconciled to the way that the companies operate.

15:19.220 --> 15:33.280
Also the fact that while it is, I guess you're right, it is a company, it does not deal that directly with the exploitation of worlds.

15:33.280 --> 15:41.900
It only comes in as a troubleshooter and as a wielder of expertise.

15:44.920 --> 15:56.820
And I very quickly got her so that she could pick and choose as much as possible her own hunts.

15:56.820 --> 16:04.940
So that if something was really, smelled rotten to her, she would just say, forget it.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.500
And then the Star Hunters was the first book in which she was a hunter.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.440
And that kind of allows you to go off on a little bit different tangent.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.920
She or she wants to find her mother's world and her mother.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.960
But this gives her something interesting to do in the meantime.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.540
Well, it's not only that, it's her road to get there.

16:24.540 --> 16:26.980
You know, I supported myself since I was 17.

16:27.780 --> 16:36.540
And I have a very, one of the things that has bothered me about a lot of, well, not a lot, but some of the books I've read, which I've enjoyed in other ways,

16:37.660 --> 16:43.080
is people just don't seem to have that much trouble getting from place to place.

16:43.380 --> 16:48.780
You know, they pick up the money or they already have their spaceships or whatever.

16:48.780 --> 17:02.160
And I always thought that she really needs a good, believable way of getting from world to world.

17:02.660 --> 17:07.040
You know, she's going to have to work quite hard to do this in a lot of ways.

17:07.540 --> 17:17.080
So that Hunters was my way of eventually helping her to survive, getting her from world to world.

17:17.080 --> 17:20.080
And eventually getting her ship.

17:24.200 --> 17:32.120
Some things I've read in economics and so on, spaceships are not going to be cheap things ever,

17:32.400 --> 17:41.400
even in the distant future where, you know, they seem to be hopping all over the place.

17:42.780 --> 17:47.960
You can see what it takes, it takes the whole nation to provide our first spaceship, the shuttle.

17:48.280 --> 17:56.880
So I figured that she is going to have to, well, have a way, she's not going to steal it,

17:59.720 --> 18:07.760
of acquiring herself transportation, a transportation that can free her from dependence upon other people.

18:08.620 --> 18:12.020
And that's what she's basically gone into Hunters for.

18:12.640 --> 18:17.840
Also, it has developed, I hadn't intended her to stay there that long,

18:17.940 --> 18:26.320
but it has developed as a place where she can have friends and slowly begin to insert herself into the life of the world,

18:26.380 --> 18:28.900
rather than being the total loner always.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.560
I know she got kind of lonesome.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.240
Understandably so.

18:35.120 --> 18:41.260
The Know-Where Hunt, now I'm a chemist, I'm not an English professor or anything,

18:41.840 --> 18:46.200
but I enjoy books from a literature point of view.

18:46.320 --> 18:52.020
But to me, the Know-Where Hunt introduced, this was maybe a more, not more sophisticated necessarily,

18:52.240 --> 18:56.700
but a different style where you use the alternate points of view of Aletus and Rohan.

18:57.280 --> 19:01.540
Is this your experimenting with this kind of presentation?

19:02.460 --> 19:10.000
Yeah, well, you see, each one, it's a very cautious experimentation.

19:10.940 --> 19:15.660
The one after that, the Ghost Hunt, is much more experimental and leaps about a bit more.

19:15.800 --> 19:16.740
It's kind of jerky actually.

19:17.380 --> 19:25.400
I mean, it leaps from point to point and point of view to point of view and writing style quite a bit more than the Know-Where Hunt.

19:26.200 --> 19:36.220
But, yeah, I was always trying out something new, trying to look at things from several sides at once,

19:36.320 --> 19:44.420
or at least two sides at once, and contrasting viewpoints, using each view, Aletus's view point as the outsider,

19:45.200 --> 19:54.480
and the little witch girl or whatever it is, Rohan, I forgot your name now.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.560
I called it Ro-Hi-R-O-H-A.

19:57.760 --> 20:03.520
Yeah, using her point, it's the one who is totally immersed within her society,

20:04.180 --> 20:06.960
and besides, it was a lot of fun developing that society.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.160
Yeah, that was quite a complicated society.

20:10.360 --> 20:15.120
Then, of course, the twist in that book was that Swarhilt was released.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.980
Had you always intended to release these poor people?

20:18.080 --> 20:24.120
No. Actually, I got the idea on here, and I figured I was going to get it off her somehow.

20:25.140 --> 20:29.160
But, I was wondering if there was a little... I went for a walk and I suddenly said,

20:29.180 --> 20:31.360
hey, what if?

20:31.920 --> 20:43.320
And so, when I just finished, they bought, probably out in about a year, called Trek Across Ibex.

20:44.060 --> 20:45.700
The second one comes out.

20:47.040 --> 20:50.160
Shadith the singer gains herself a 14-year-old body,

20:51.260 --> 20:53.740
and she's going to continue as poet and singer.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.900
And I figure on her adventures on after a while.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.420
She's a very interesting little person.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.940
But, no, I didn't intend that.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.720
I didn't even think about that when I started,

21:03.980 --> 21:12.980
but those energy creatures or whatever, the big bubble things that kept getting together,

21:15.040 --> 21:18.720
they sort of, as I thought them up, I said, huh,

21:20.060 --> 21:26.460
you know, they suck the life out of you and turn you into a vegetable, maybe.

21:27.260 --> 21:28.900
And that sort of worked it out.

21:29.660 --> 21:33.240
It was, as I said, very interesting.

21:33.680 --> 21:40.340
And then, it made the relationship between the two of them much more complicated

21:40.340 --> 21:44.840
as it had been before, and as I said, the complications are what I like.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.520
Okay.

21:50.120 --> 21:53.260
I should think, I'll just make an editorial statement here,

21:53.260 --> 21:55.940
I should think that Alitas, after the die-dim,

21:56.540 --> 21:59.880
Dwellers are gone would be an interesting person to write about too.

22:01.620 --> 22:05.020
Yeah, I'm going to leave her for a while though.

22:06.740 --> 22:13.140
I've got something very sneaky worked out, I hope, if I use it,

22:15.260 --> 22:23.500
for the sorceress who was the original captive of the die-dim.

22:24.280 --> 22:29.000
And once she's out, the whole thing falls off and Alitas is free.

22:31.580 --> 22:35.120
There isn't this little time bomb that I've given Alitas though,

22:35.300 --> 22:39.400
the fact that she's possibly, or at least close to immortal,

22:39.560 --> 22:44.920
or at least very long-lived as compared to the people around her,

22:45.540 --> 22:53.720
which makes it possible later on to jerk her out of the society

22:53.720 --> 22:57.060
that she's going to have her home in for a while.

22:57.060 --> 22:59.640
And perhaps I'll do something more with her,

23:01.620 --> 23:04.620
having to face the decision to leave, you know,

23:04.720 --> 23:06.280
and then what she's going to do for men.

23:07.520 --> 23:13.780
It's interesting, I don't know, it depends on whether I'm too involved in other things.

23:14.400 --> 23:19.020
It takes me a long time to write these things, you know, about three years each,

23:19.460 --> 23:21.800
but then I'm writing about three or four at the same time,

23:21.800 --> 23:28.100
so overlapping them at different stages, you know.

23:30.620 --> 23:34.300
Ghost Hunt then came along, and as you mentioned,

23:34.600 --> 23:38.560
it does have perhaps the more trying form of writing,

23:38.580 --> 23:40.160
which was from three points of view.

23:40.980 --> 23:45.340
And this one was the first one, and if I recall,

23:45.340 --> 23:47.680
that was kind of an urban setting.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.480
It was an adventure science fiction.

23:49.480 --> 23:53.080
She didn't get raped and beat up and all that, and beat up on.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.080
And this, again, is something different for you.

23:56.420 --> 24:00.500
Just more experimenting, more expanding your writing.

24:01.300 --> 24:01.620
Yep.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.680
And the next one the woman was talking about,

24:04.800 --> 24:07.740
the Trek Across Ibex is your basic Trek story,

24:07.900 --> 24:09.900
we cross the world and get back again.

24:12.100 --> 24:14.700
And I've done something different in that one too.

24:14.700 --> 24:19.100
I've been thrown in some fairy tales, sort of, stories,

24:19.500 --> 24:21.700
which I'm probably going to do more of.

24:22.640 --> 24:27.100
The one I'm working on right now, the third in the trilogy,

24:27.980 --> 24:33.880
the Dula Sorcery trilogy, is you're talking about different points of view.

24:34.080 --> 24:37.340
I've got, I've been writing what is basically four novelettes

24:37.340 --> 24:42.480
with four viewpoint characters and writing them all separately,

24:43.180 --> 24:47.200
just about finished with those, next week or the week after.

24:47.380 --> 24:49.020
I'm going to start braiding them all together.

24:49.540 --> 24:50.520
It's been fascinating.

24:51.380 --> 24:53.560
I'll try, I'm playing them off against each other,

24:53.780 --> 25:02.040
looking for echoes and all sorts of chimes and heightened suspense

25:02.040 --> 25:05.400
and contrast, you know, and all of this kind of thing,

25:07.520 --> 25:09.700
leading up to the final battle.

25:09.700 --> 25:14.840
But four very, very different characters, female characters.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.580
So it's going to be a complicated book too.

25:20.500 --> 25:24.100
This is, again, this is a question I was going to ask at the end,

25:24.120 --> 25:25.780
but it's a good place to bring it up.

25:26.260 --> 25:31.980
I empathize with this completely, but Alitas really likes to be clean

25:31.980 --> 25:35.740
and take a bath, and it drives her nuts to be all yucky

25:35.740 --> 25:37.320
and all that out in the wilderness.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.720
And that's one thing I've really enjoyed because it makes her feel

25:40.720 --> 25:42.560
such, such like a real person.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.240
Well, I grew up on a farm.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.960
And after you've exercised a lot, and this is a farm in California

25:51.960 --> 25:57.160
where it's, they spend about a month in the San Joaquin Valley.

25:57.360 --> 26:01.840
They go, sort of, going between 100 and 108.

26:01.840 --> 26:10.220
If you've ever worked on a farm, hoeing weeds or plowing or whatever,

26:10.660 --> 26:14.820
you know, picking watermelon or anything like this,

26:15.460 --> 26:18.540
you'll know that the first thing you head for when you come in

26:18.540 --> 26:22.380
is a bath because you stink.

26:24.380 --> 26:30.200
And you are dirty, and you have, you're covered with dust

26:30.200 --> 26:36.800
and pollen and, oh, it's just miserable.

26:37.460 --> 26:40.560
And also, I've done a lot about backpacking into mountains

26:40.560 --> 26:42.240
and capping up on myself, too.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.220
And if you are away from water a few days,

26:47.220 --> 26:52.480
that first touch of the, even the icy cold water is bliss.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.900
There's a lot of me in that, too.

26:56.860 --> 27:01.160
Okay. I have a quote, a two-sentence quote that I want to read

27:01.160 --> 27:02.920
and ask you something about it.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.580
This is from Ghost Tundin.

27:04.640 --> 27:10.940
This is the chapter in which Tamrus and Elidas are meeting all the people on the planet.

27:11.220 --> 27:11.980
And the quote is,

27:12.280 --> 27:16.160
Tamrus stretched, scratched her nose and grinned at what she'd written.

27:16.580 --> 27:20.360
All the description wasn't especially necessary, but it was fun to write.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.280
Was that you talking, really?

27:23.280 --> 27:26.140
Of course. Yes, yes.

27:27.460 --> 27:28.520
It is.

27:31.580 --> 27:38.000
The writing I find more and more difficult, as I get, I guess,

27:38.080 --> 27:39.360
know a bit more about it.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.760
But it never stops being fun, especially the first parts

27:42.760 --> 27:44.400
where you're just scratching down notes,

27:44.660 --> 27:47.680
where you're making up descriptions, where you're looking down names,

27:47.920 --> 27:51.600
you're making up myths and constellations

27:51.600 --> 27:59.480
and maps and putting together societies.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.820
It's fun.

28:02.260 --> 28:12.040
It's playing a game in a way that nobody else in the world is going to ever play it.

28:14.460 --> 28:18.400
And when you get down to the hard, slugging work of putting it all together,

28:18.400 --> 28:22.940
at least first draft, why, that's what keeps you going through it.

28:23.020 --> 28:26.400
And of course, I've heard a lot of people complain about rewriting,

28:26.500 --> 28:27.640
but I love rewriting.

28:28.060 --> 28:31.220
This is when you begin to play with the words and you get the cadences

28:31.220 --> 28:38.560
and you get the sentences to read smoothly and you get the effects that you want.

28:38.820 --> 28:40.060
This is the fun time.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.640
You've already got all that material and now you're messing with it.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.340
But that's why it takes so long to write a book, right?

28:46.340 --> 28:52.380
Yeah. If I were really efficient and sometimes my little country,

28:53.140 --> 28:56.560
Puritan work ethic background gets on to me,

28:57.240 --> 29:03.060
I would try to do it all first draft, but forget it.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.240
That's too much fun doing the playing.

29:06.100 --> 29:09.000
It also means that I'm not very organized.

29:11.960 --> 29:16.240
Well, as a reader, your effort is well appreciated.

29:17.460 --> 29:21.040
Especially in that part of the book with the description all in the names,

29:21.400 --> 29:26.760
it really reminded me quite a bit of Jack Vance, which to me is the ultimate compliment.

29:27.740 --> 29:29.180
Very much. Yes, I agree.

29:33.660 --> 29:40.160
I look back and a lot of that was not necessary, but I was enjoying myself.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.380
So I figured maybe the reader would too.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.660
Yes, point well made.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.540
The critics like your books generally.

29:49.500 --> 29:53.420
They're a few picky, but by and large they really like them.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.840
And the one thing they all say, where they like them or not,

29:55.840 --> 29:58.860
is that your characters are strong and good and believable.

29:59.440 --> 30:03.740
And this is different from most science fiction because it's not generally considered to be a character literature

30:03.740 --> 30:06.100
and it's the reason I particularly like your works.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.060
So from what you said, the characters really mean a lot to you.

30:10.160 --> 30:13.320
There's part of you in them and you really work hard on them.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.020
Oh, yes. Yes.

30:16.280 --> 30:22.540
Actually, as I go on, I've come to the understanding that this is the kind of book I like to read.

30:23.120 --> 30:28.280
For example, I just finished two mainstream novels that I really enjoyed very much,

30:28.320 --> 30:30.280
and that's principally because of the characters.

30:30.720 --> 30:36.220
And that was John Cowell's Daniel Martin, which is a book about a writer in a way, which I found fascinating.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.240
He's marvelous with characters, especially women.

30:41.440 --> 30:50.920
And John Gardner's Melon, Mickelson's Ghost, which was also had a very strong and to me interesting character in it.

30:53.280 --> 30:58.700
And I'm trying to go deeper and deeper into my characters as the more I write.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.980
That seems, as I said, to be the things that I'm really most interested in.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.640
Who these people are and why they do it.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.560
The rest is fun, but this is serious.

31:07.780 --> 31:09.640
The characters are serious as far as I'm concerned.

31:10.920 --> 31:16.740
You also, though, the settings are very rich and they're varied from book to book.

31:16.740 --> 31:19.080
You have an efficacy with languages.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.120
The aliens are believable, so it's not just all your characters.

31:24.860 --> 31:30.920
Well, like I said, that's where the artist side comes in.

31:31.040 --> 31:40.260
There are a lot of writers who have artists in avocations rather than their vocations.

31:41.820 --> 31:44.200
Because it is the artist's eye.

31:44.540 --> 31:48.200
You begin when you look at things, when you learn to look at things as an artist,

31:48.360 --> 31:51.660
you look at things in terms of shape and form.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.360
And also each thing is individual.

31:54.800 --> 31:57.000
Each thing has its own form, its own shape.

31:57.600 --> 32:04.420
Each blade of grass in a certain sort of way, each leaf, each tree is very, very individual.

32:05.540 --> 32:08.490
It's one way to avoiding cliché.

32:08.490 --> 32:12.210
If you see things clearly enough and if they are individual enough,

32:12.550 --> 32:19.070
it's impossible to write in clichés or try to overuse language, I think.

32:21.950 --> 32:26.870
Okay, to review Elitist then, you've got a couple of more...

32:26.870 --> 32:29.750
You're planning on a couple of more books with Elitist and the die-dem,

32:30.270 --> 32:35.910
and then you'll just kind of drop back and punt and see what develops with Elitist or those characters.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.370
Right, I think so.

32:39.030 --> 32:40.430
With Elitist for sure.

32:40.710 --> 32:48.850
I just about got her, so I know her so thoroughly that I don't have any more stories for her.

32:48.950 --> 32:50.770
I won't have after this next one.

32:52.190 --> 32:55.830
So I'm going to leave her for a while, at least a while.

32:56.290 --> 32:57.890
Maybe forever, I don't know.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.110
That depends.

33:00.910 --> 33:02.950
And go on in other directions.

33:04.930 --> 33:08.490
I like long series, but not long, long.

33:08.610 --> 33:13.250
I like closed-in series, you know, the finite series,

33:13.890 --> 33:18.570
where you eventually come to some resolution, otherwise it just starts getting old.

33:20.050 --> 33:24.470
And I think what would happen is if I kept on writing about her,

33:25.170 --> 33:29.210
I would start writing in formula, and I would get very distressed for myself for that.

33:31.510 --> 33:38.550
I've been very, very fortunate in that they sold, the books have sold well enough,

33:38.730 --> 33:43.050
and Don keeps, Wilhelm keeps buying them, for which I thank him,

33:43.730 --> 33:54.290
that I've been able to do each one as a thing in itself, individual in itself,

33:54.290 --> 33:59.970
following no formulas, following nothing before the story goes and where the character goes.

34:00.230 --> 34:04.670
And that's a blessing, and I don't want to give it up.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.190
So it's going to be very much a shut series.

34:10.970 --> 34:18.450
Okay, I want to switch now to the What's Been Criss And I Guess The Duel Of Sorcery series.

34:18.450 --> 34:23.810
The first question I'll ask you is, why did you switch from science fiction to fantasy?

34:24.950 --> 34:28.510
Oh, because the park road sat down beside me one day.

34:30.250 --> 34:31.810
That is the literal truth.

34:34.690 --> 34:38.350
It's one of these huge ones, about three inches long, and I'm sitting here,

34:38.570 --> 34:44.650
you know, I told you I lived in this little place, little shotgun apartment above a private house,

34:44.650 --> 34:47.570
and I'm sitting on the steps, waiting for the mailman to come.

34:47.750 --> 34:49.850
It's the thing I do, you know, riders do.

34:51.910 --> 34:57.490
And this cockroach came crawling down the side of the house, and it sat there and it looked at me.

34:58.190 --> 35:02.090
And, you know, your first reaction with the cockroach is, smash it.

35:02.810 --> 35:08.550
But I decided just to sit here and look at it, and it's really, it's just being a little creature.

35:08.810 --> 35:10.750
Actually, it's kind of pretty in its way.

35:11.550 --> 35:15.830
Very nice lines, very bright black eyes, low, little alert.

35:16.470 --> 35:19.010
And it just sat there and we looked at each other for a while.

35:19.810 --> 35:26.050
And so I decided to write a story about a cockroach, and I decided that it's going to be fantasy.

35:28.310 --> 35:35.030
It seemed to fit in fantasy, so that cockroach ended up, I believe,

35:35.030 --> 35:41.090
with about ten pages out of 300 or something like that.

35:41.550 --> 35:44.450
But he was in there, he was by inspiration.

35:45.530 --> 35:48.610
And I don't know, he just felt like writing fantasy.

35:50.230 --> 35:53.990
It wasn't any great momentous decision, it's just the way it turned out.

35:55.290 --> 36:01.430
Now that you've written, or at least have published all of two fantasy books

36:01.430 --> 36:07.050
and what the obvious sequel coming out, is it any different to write fantasy

36:07.050 --> 36:11.670
since it's a little more freewheeling, you're a little bit less limited by the rules,

36:12.290 --> 36:14.090
or do you find it to be that way?

36:14.810 --> 36:26.670
Well, I am one of those who really believes that there are rules to magic.

36:26.670 --> 36:32.230
I don't believe in magic at all, but it's fun to play with.

36:33.090 --> 36:45.770
It's sort of an extension of the psionics, which is probably present, is not a science either.

36:46.290 --> 36:51.070
Might be, but many people are skeptical about that.

36:51.070 --> 37:02.610
But I can't, it is just the same thing in a sense as writing science fiction.

37:03.030 --> 37:12.290
Only you write in other terms the same kind of rulekeeping.

37:15.530 --> 37:31.450
And the societies, you can play with visual things and possibilities in a different way.

37:32.370 --> 37:37.330
It's not more loose than science fiction, if you do it properly, I think.

37:37.330 --> 37:46.390
It just has a different set of assumptions, and it's fun to play with those assumptions.

37:50.710 --> 37:52.710
Sarah Wee? Is that how it's pronounced?

37:52.990 --> 37:53.610
Sarah Wee.

37:53.630 --> 37:55.710
Okay, I really butchered that.

37:55.830 --> 37:57.070
You want, like I said.

37:57.310 --> 37:59.470
Sarah Wee. Okay, I prefer to pronounce it.

37:59.490 --> 37:59.650
No.

37:59.890 --> 38:00.470
Just as you do.

38:00.690 --> 38:01.710
Okay, Sarah Wee.

38:02.470 --> 38:03.670
Maybe I'll adopt that.

38:04.110 --> 38:04.490
I like that.

38:05.150 --> 38:10.090
Well, my daughter's name is Sarah, so it kind of, it made me think about it like that.

38:11.170 --> 38:13.190
She's a bit like Alitas.

38:13.790 --> 38:17.710
She's a cast-off, and she's a strong female character.

38:18.230 --> 38:19.350
They both have red hair.

38:20.270 --> 38:21.970
They didn't have happy childhoods.

38:22.250 --> 38:26.650
That seems to be something that you've come back to again.

38:27.730 --> 38:31.670
Yeah, well, my own childhood was extremely happy.

38:31.670 --> 38:36.490
But I've taught at inner-city schools for something like 14 years.

38:37.030 --> 38:41.810
I did, and happy childhoods were the exception.

38:43.070 --> 38:46.530
Also, they explain a lot of things, too.

38:47.950 --> 38:52.410
Things that go wrong for people, unhappy childhoods do.

38:57.970 --> 39:05.670
I suppose it's a, I'm going to have to think about that a bit, because you're right.

39:08.670 --> 39:13.990
Maybe it's because of the outsider idea, whether there's so much than the unhappiness.

39:15.090 --> 39:17.590
Because, as I said, mine was a very happy childhood.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.510
We'd live on the farm, and we worked hard.

39:19.510 --> 39:26.350
But again, we're a very close family, but I'm very much an outsider from a lot of you points myself.

39:26.970 --> 39:31.750
So I suppose that's going to show up again and again in all of my female characters.

39:32.470 --> 39:39.070
They are the people who look on, who interact, but then step away from a lot.

39:40.890 --> 39:45.370
You know, I, I, I, that probably came from the same source.

39:46.090 --> 39:46.410
You're right.

39:47.830 --> 39:51.190
You mentioned strong female characters, then.

39:51.290 --> 39:57.290
Do you plan to continue writing, mainly with female characters as the lead protagonist, anyway?

39:58.470 --> 40:02.670
Yeah, because I know a woman from the inside out, you know, from under the skin out.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.730
And that's one of the things I'm interested in.

40:04.730 --> 40:19.630
Although I'm, you know, I might, just as a trial, a trial with a male character as the lead, it would be much harder for me.

40:19.710 --> 40:25.490
I suppose that's why so many, when they were all men writing, there were so many boys and men main characters.

40:25.690 --> 40:26.490
It's simply easier.

40:28.410 --> 40:31.790
That's one of the reasons I keep writing short stories, because I can't do it.

40:31.790 --> 40:34.810
So I'm very stubborn about that kind of thing.

40:34.970 --> 40:40.010
So I probably end up one of these days using, having a male character as the main character.

40:40.110 --> 40:48.610
Maybe we'll book with all men in it, rather than, as one of my favorite books is,

40:51.170 --> 40:51.810
Oh dear.

40:52.790 --> 40:54.630
Have you ever had this block in the back of your head?

40:54.690 --> 40:55.250
Many times.

40:55.290 --> 40:56.290
Motherlines, Motherlines.

40:56.290 --> 41:00.210
By Dennis Susie Charnes, where she had a book with all females in it.

41:00.930 --> 41:03.730
I might try the opposite thing, but I don't know.

41:05.770 --> 41:15.950
There are a lot of small cultural things that I know about being women together that I probably wouldn't know about being men together.

41:16.070 --> 41:19.930
Not only just the outside feelings, but the way people relate to each other,

41:19.930 --> 41:24.810
and the way people react to stimulus.

41:25.950 --> 41:30.170
In our culture and in other cultures, women and men do this differently.

41:30.550 --> 41:34.970
Perhaps because it's something innate, but perhaps it's something that is cultural.

41:35.670 --> 41:41.830
But it is also something that's very important to me in creating the characters.

41:42.910 --> 41:43.850
So I don't know.

41:44.010 --> 41:45.890
They'll probably be mostly female.

41:48.550 --> 41:51.830
I wanted to ask you a bit about the mechanics of writing Moongather,

41:52.050 --> 41:55.690
since it was written in alternate chapters, The Woman and the Child.

41:56.930 --> 41:58.990
I'm curious, how do you do this mechanically?

41:59.110 --> 42:01.990
Do you write The Woman all the way through, and The Child all the way through,

42:02.110 --> 42:06.070
and then chop it up, or do you actually write it in the sequence in which it was published?

42:06.870 --> 42:09.970
I read a lot of it in the sequence in which it was published.

42:09.970 --> 42:15.850
There are a lot of things, I guess, private to me, because people haven't noticed them,

42:17.070 --> 42:21.030
that one section would suggest to me to put into the next section.

42:22.130 --> 42:30.550
So the book, strangely enough, was written in the order in which it eventually turned out,

42:30.730 --> 42:32.470
although it changed a great deal.

42:33.130 --> 42:36.450
If you saw my first draft, you wouldn't even recognize the book.

42:36.450 --> 42:39.450
They changed so much in between drafts.

42:40.590 --> 42:45.070
Things become multi-layered instead of straightforward.

42:46.530 --> 42:49.310
It's what time and drafting does for me.

42:51.730 --> 42:55.590
Another thing you write from the perspective of a woman,

42:55.730 --> 42:59.070
because that's what you know better, and I certainly understand that,

42:59.370 --> 43:04.310
but you also write well from the perspective of a child, and we're all children once,

43:04.310 --> 43:09.470
but not everybody remembers that, and that also would require putting yourself

43:09.470 --> 43:11.910
what was it like back then in remembering.

43:12.950 --> 43:16.430
You also have to remember, though, that I've been a teacher for a number of years,

43:16.550 --> 43:21.550
and I've dealt with children, not young, young children, actually.

43:21.810 --> 43:24.650
I could be the youngest of the seventh graders, but I spent a lot of time,

43:24.770 --> 43:29.610
especially the last six years, with my teaching, with kids,

43:32.190 --> 43:34.470
and getting to know them pretty well.

43:37.790 --> 43:40.850
So they're...the way they react...

43:40.850 --> 43:44.690
I've gotten an awful lot of material from my teaching days.

43:45.190 --> 43:50.450
There's enough there about human nature and about reaction to last me for a hundred years.

43:51.510 --> 43:54.330
It's very difficult to write and teach at the same time,

43:54.370 --> 43:57.550
because both are very exhausting procedures.

43:58.550 --> 44:03.290
You come home from school so tired that it's almost impossible sometimes

44:03.290 --> 44:09.930
to pick up the pencil or the pen, because I write all my first drafts with a pen.

44:10.870 --> 44:13.030
Not the typewriter, I can't do it on typewriter.

44:13.790 --> 44:22.690
But it also is invaluable teaching you how people work together

44:22.690 --> 44:29.190
and how they don't work together, giving you insights into character and so on.

44:32.350 --> 44:36.690
Actually, I'd recommend to any writer that they teach a couple of years.

44:37.190 --> 44:40.070
A lot of people, a lot of science fiction writers have,

44:41.150 --> 44:46.070
but once they start really seriously writing, they'll have to stop teaching.

44:46.590 --> 44:48.110
It's just too exhausting.

44:49.010 --> 44:50.610
So you don't teach right now?

44:50.610 --> 44:57.550
No, actually I was fortunate enough before I went crazy to be able to quit.

44:57.850 --> 45:03.730
I just sold the fourth book and I sold everything I'd written since I started.

45:04.450 --> 45:07.550
So I figured that was a reasonably good sign, and so I said,

45:07.790 --> 45:11.710
oh well, let's quit this, and I did.

45:13.910 --> 45:17.710
Will you take the Duel of Sorcery?

45:18.410 --> 45:20.430
It's presumably a trilogy now.

45:20.510 --> 45:24.450
Are you going to take it further or use that same milieu for adventures?

45:24.990 --> 45:26.690
I will probably use the same milieu.

45:27.190 --> 45:32.110
One of the things I find in making up these worlds and the cultures,

45:32.290 --> 45:36.290
I get so much information that I can't use in the stories.

45:37.150 --> 45:43.830
That I have a lot of stuff left over and it's available for use with other stories.

45:44.750 --> 45:50.210
So I'm probably going to use the milieu.

45:53.030 --> 45:57.630
Maybe move the culture a couple of hundred years in the future

45:57.630 --> 46:01.430
and start off from there and see what happens.

46:04.190 --> 46:08.430
I'm going to have one hell of a mix-up at the end of this Changes Moon,

46:08.630 --> 46:09.490
which is the next one.

46:09.870 --> 46:11.310
That's the one I'm working on now.

46:11.470 --> 46:14.570
It's got the four character viewpoints.

46:15.370 --> 46:18.770
It's going to have a marvelous battle in me,

46:18.850 --> 46:25.210
and it's going to have one hell of a magic scene in the Two Sides meet.

46:27.150 --> 46:28.510
It's going to be sad.

46:29.730 --> 46:31.130
Good future, good future.

46:32.090 --> 46:33.410
Oh no, okay.

46:35.210 --> 46:38.390
Okay, listen, that's the end of my questions.

46:39.010 --> 46:40.650
I didn't hit on the short stories,

46:40.810 --> 46:43.610
but I don't read as many short stories as I should.

46:44.130 --> 46:47.450
I work for a living and I have to draw on the line somewhere,

46:47.490 --> 46:49.190
so I don't read very many short stories.

46:49.310 --> 46:53.970
But I really enjoy your novels, particularly the Elitists.

46:53.970 --> 46:55.750
I'm more of a science fiction than a fantasy.

46:55.870 --> 46:56.810
I like it.

46:57.090 --> 47:00.010
And I really look forward to seeing what's coming out.

47:00.850 --> 47:02.250
Okay, I hope you enjoy them.

47:03.090 --> 47:07.790
By the way, one of the things that I really want people to do is just enjoy them.

47:07.870 --> 47:10.190
I have loved to read since I was four years old.

47:11.870 --> 47:15.650
It's one of the things I try to teach my kids to do when I was teaching them.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.310
Just to plain love to read.

47:18.530 --> 47:21.710
Now, that's what I want people to do with when I write.

47:21.710 --> 47:23.590
Just enjoy the hell out of them.

47:23.750 --> 47:25.130
They are very enjoyable.

47:25.710 --> 47:30.450
Let me ask you a favor of sorts.

47:30.830 --> 47:32.150
I'm a book collector.

47:32.630 --> 47:35.210
Could I possibly get my books autographed by you?

47:35.350 --> 47:40.910
If I send you the books and the return postage and all that.

47:41.210 --> 47:41.790
Okay, fine.

47:41.930 --> 47:42.810
Would that be any problem?

47:43.130 --> 47:43.970
No, probably not.

47:44.210 --> 47:44.870
Okay, great.

47:45.190 --> 47:47.650
Just the address that I use to contact you.

47:47.830 --> 47:49.870
That's the one on IrishV.

47:49.870 --> 47:51.250
Great, I appreciate it.

47:51.490 --> 47:54.930
That kind of makes this special to kind of cap it off.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.530
Enjoy your work immensely.

47:57.850 --> 47:59.250
That's the reason I want to interview you.

47:59.490 --> 48:02.030
And we'll get you the tapes when we get them made.

48:02.250 --> 48:04.270
And as I said, it'll be the fall and I'll get you my books.

48:04.410 --> 48:06.050
And thank you and thank you for the interview.

48:06.450 --> 48:07.410
Okay, this is fun.

48:07.550 --> 48:07.990
Very nice.

48:08.170 --> 48:08.770
Thanks again.

48:09.130 --> 48:09.610
Bye-bye now.
