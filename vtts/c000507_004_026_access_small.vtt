00:11.420 --> 00:18.520
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today, presented by the

00:18.520 --> 00:20.760
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:24.060 --> 00:27.260
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.900 --> 00:37.100
Our present show is an interview with author Jerry Pornell. Pornell began writing science

00:37.100 --> 00:42.660
fiction fairly recently in the 1970s, but he's already had a huge impact on the field. He's

00:42.660 --> 00:47.000
been president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, for instance. He's created a future

00:47.000 --> 00:51.640
history, an empire called the Codominium, which is extrapolated from our present political

00:51.640 --> 00:58.200
situation. He's also co-authored with Larry Niven a number of well-known novels, The Best

00:58.200 --> 01:02.500
Selling Lucifer's Hammer, a graphic fictional study of what might happen should accommodate

01:02.500 --> 01:06.960
Earth as one of them, and The Moten God's Eye, perhaps the best first contact novel

01:06.960 --> 01:12.960
written to date. More recently, however, his career has taken a new turn. He's dedicated

01:12.960 --> 01:17.620
himself to the future of the planet Earth. He's trying to revive the United States

01:17.620 --> 01:22.560
Space Program and is working on a federal committee to that end. He writes a science

01:22.560 --> 01:28.240
column for Galaxy Magazine, and he's recently published a nonfiction book titled A Step

01:28.240 --> 01:34.420
Farther Out, which consists of essays on potential methods of spaceflight, on plans on how we

01:34.420 --> 01:40.780
could colonize a solar system, and an explanation of the L5 Society. He's gotten a deserved

01:40.780 --> 01:45.720
reputation as one of the country's foremost futurists. His concern about our future was

01:45.720 --> 01:47.680
evident when he spoke to the Science Fiction Radio Show.

02:02.300 --> 02:07.360
In The Moten God's Eye, your co-author Larry Niven and you were trying to write what I

02:07.360 --> 02:11.840
believe you called the epitome of a first contact novel. You must have had to develop

02:11.840 --> 02:13.820
quite a bit of background information for that, didn't you?

02:37.360 --> 02:39.440
In general, developing the Modi culture?

03:07.360 --> 03:15.340
I can't work without knowing why things happen. I've learned that Larry is a lot more able

03:15.340 --> 03:22.020
to believe in six impossible things before breakfast than I am. So he can sit there and

03:22.020 --> 03:27.420
write a story that you hadn't really believed could happen. I'm not very good at that. I

03:27.420 --> 03:33.620
generally don't, I can't stay interested in something unless I think it might happen,

03:34.760 --> 03:39.780
which means that I have to work out how it could have happened. So we ended up getting

03:39.780 --> 03:45.400
quite a lot of stuff on the subject of the Modi. As far as I can see, they're a fairly

03:45.400 --> 03:54.180
self-consistent set of aliens. Probably there's no such thing, but their evolution could easily

03:54.180 --> 03:56.240
have come about, I think.

03:57.920 --> 04:03.680
Why did you and Niven choose to put Modan Gadzaya in your future history of the codominium?

04:04.000 --> 04:12.500
Oh, I don't know. I didn't believe in his future history. His known space series has

04:12.500 --> 04:17.780
got, in my judgment, a whole year to drive across through. I just don't think it could

04:17.780 --> 04:23.800
happen, neither does he, by the way. So, which doesn't mean it's not interesting because

04:23.800 --> 04:28.680
it isn't. It's interesting and a lot of fun. But again, I have this problem of not really

04:28.680 --> 04:36.320
being able to do a lot of work on things that I don't believe in. So we built this around

04:36.320 --> 04:40.500
the so and I already had it worked out.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.240
How did you put together the codominium?

04:45.460 --> 04:49.360
Oh, I don't know. About the same way we're putting it together in the real world, isn't

04:50.320 --> 04:57.880
it? It looks now as if the alliance seems to be the United States and China, but it

04:57.880 --> 05:02.700
could just about as easily given a few changes in the structure of government in Russia. It

05:02.700 --> 05:05.480
had been the United States and Russia against China, couldn't it?

05:05.860 --> 05:06.600
Yeah, very possibly.

05:07.120 --> 05:12.720
And in fact, that was a very logical way for things to have gone back in the 60s when the

05:12.720 --> 05:16.320
Chinese were running around trying to tear the world apart, you may remember.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.080
Yes.

05:18.240 --> 05:23.500
They've got reasonable and the Russians didn't, as it happened, but it could just as easily

05:23.500 --> 05:24.500
have gone the other way.

05:26.340 --> 05:31.100
So really, you took and extrapolated our existing political situation.

05:31.280 --> 05:36.680
Yeah, well, I'm not convinced it won't happen yet, of course. I mean, Russia's got to go

05:36.680 --> 05:42.480
out of business one of these days, and who knows who takes over over there? They don't

05:42.480 --> 05:48.400
know. Why should we know? I don't suppose there's anybody in the world who knows who's

05:48.400 --> 05:50.880
going to be in charge when Brezhnev goes out of business, right?

05:51.420 --> 05:51.620
Right.

05:53.280 --> 06:00.400
Including Brezhnev. The United States at least has got a certain amount of stability in

06:00.400 --> 06:06.340
the region, make a fairly short list of people who are likely to be president, and the mechanism

06:06.340 --> 06:12.060
by which they get there is fairly well known. The mechanism by which you get to be the

06:12.060 --> 06:16.080
unanimous choice of the Russian people to be their fearless leader is not really known

06:16.080 --> 06:17.520
even to the Russians, is it?

06:18.480 --> 06:19.840
Not from what I can tell.

06:20.160 --> 06:26.480
Well, I'm going to, Maria thought he had it set up at one point, and his gun stuck in

06:26.480 --> 06:32.060
his pocket quite literally. They had a shootout at a cabinet meeting, and he lost.

06:34.560 --> 06:41.920
So you take the coefficient or friction of a gunfight against a wool suit, and you fall

06:41.920 --> 06:46.040
right in as one of the important variables of human history, right?

06:46.480 --> 06:46.840
Right.

06:47.220 --> 06:51.060
Since if Maria had been in charge, he never knows what happens. I suspect the codominium

06:51.060 --> 06:57.520
would have come about if Maria had taken over instead of Khrushchev. He was just a

06:57.520 --> 07:00.400
cynical power broker. I doubt that he believed in very much of anything.

07:01.980 --> 07:04.760
Perhaps you could give us a bit of background information about yourself.

07:06.580 --> 07:12.300
Yeah, well, I used to write books before I took out saving the space program for a living.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.360
It seems to be what I'm doing lately is I'm sitting here with a telephone glued in my

07:17.360 --> 07:24.040
ear just for you, Carl. I've been on a phone in Washington for two hours, yesterday all

07:24.040 --> 07:31.100
day. We're running around trying to rebuild the space program and still live within the

07:31.100 --> 07:44.220
budget cuts. It's not easy to do. I'm chairman of a citizen advisory group working on a plan

07:44.220 --> 07:50.240
for the administration. But don't let that meeting be guaranteed. They're going to take

07:50.240 --> 07:58.880
our advice. We have a problem right now in that the administration wants to chop back

07:58.880 --> 08:05.080
the budget, which you can certainly, they've got to do. The country cannot go on like it.

08:05.320 --> 08:12.020
At the same time, if we don't keep up some investments in high technology, we're not going to have

08:12.020 --> 08:17.240
anything to live off of. You've got to invest something once in a while. Unfortunately,

08:17.840 --> 08:23.500
the structure of the government and the fact situation and the rest of it is such that you are

08:23.500 --> 08:30.660
not going to get private investment in things as inherently risky as space technology because

08:30.660 --> 08:36.160
they don't let you keep into the profits. Profits are nasty words nowadays. Who wants to risk

08:36.160 --> 08:39.740
everything on something that you can't win on? You're going to have to have government research

08:39.740 --> 08:45.760
until they change some of the laws that I'm going to do with the tax structure. If we don't do that,

08:45.920 --> 08:51.380
then I guess we'll sit here and become, we're already in underdevelopation. Our major export

08:51.380 --> 08:56.740
is agriculture. We're beginning to import high technology. We're buying airplanes from overseas

08:56.740 --> 09:02.320
now. Can you imagine that? Eastern Airlines is now flying a thing called the Airbus, which is made

09:02.320 --> 09:10.200
in Europe. American domestic airlines are flying foreign airplanes. We're importing computers,

09:10.860 --> 09:16.380
and we're going to be doing more of that pretty soon. But underdeveloped countries, we don't start

09:16.380 --> 09:24.880
doing some investment. We're going to stay that way. So that's what I have been doing for the last

09:24.880 --> 09:30.780
couple of weeks, and which is why I don't have my lot of thoughts on the subject of science fiction

09:30.780 --> 09:39.720
because I'm still sitting here in the eye of a storm trying to balance about 35 different

09:39.720 --> 09:44.800
people who are involved in the air and get a rational program for high technology investment.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.780
You talked about a lot of those same things in your book a step further out, didn't you?

09:51.220 --> 09:56.860
Yeah, right. That's one reason why I seem to be involved in doing some of these things and being in

09:56.860 --> 10:05.720
charge of not in charge of that sort of ringmaster to a fairly large group of scientists and

10:05.720 --> 10:12.500
researchers because of that fact that it's a certain amount of attention.

10:14.300 --> 10:22.320
In that book, you state that our destiny is mankind is linked to our expanding ourselves into space.

10:23.920 --> 10:29.980
Yeah, well, there's that in a step further out, and I said in other columns and other places,

10:31.980 --> 10:38.860
how long is the future? We presented this, Bassoni and I presented this in the paper to an

10:38.860 --> 10:43.960
annual meeting in the American Association for the Advancement of Science. We think of it as a

10:43.960 --> 10:53.040
reasonably important philanthropic question. How long is the future? If it's the way matters and

10:53.980 --> 10:59.380
faster and the limited growth people think it's only a couple of hundred years, then there is no point

10:59.380 --> 11:06.360
in worrying about it and we might as well eat, drink and be merry, right? But if on the other hand

11:06.360 --> 11:18.580
the future is another a billion generation, a hundred billion years, then we are not the same

11:18.580 --> 11:25.420
species as an outfit that's going to live another 200 years, are we? And if mankind's future is

11:25.420 --> 11:30.440
a hundred billion years and there's no reason why it should not be a hundred billion years, then we're

11:30.440 --> 11:37.620
going to have to outlive the Earth and indeed outlive the Sun and the solar system. We may

11:37.620 --> 11:43.600
even have to outlive this galaxy. Now there's nothing in principle that keeps us from doing

11:43.600 --> 11:51.340
that. I know of nothing that could stop us other than ourselves. I've said this a lot of times, but

11:51.340 --> 11:57.560
I don't know how, you can't say it too often. One of the most ironic things that ever happened was that

11:57.560 --> 12:06.280
just after we went to the moon, they held in Stockholm a conference whose theme title was

12:06.280 --> 12:14.460
Only One Earth and that's insane. We don't live on only one Earth. We live if we want to in a system

12:14.460 --> 12:24.340
that's got nine planets and I used to say 38 moons, but now I think it's up to about 50. And a million

12:24.340 --> 12:30.320
asteroids and a million comets, that's a lot of resources out there plus an enormous

12:30.320 --> 12:36.660
thermonuclear generator which the Environmental Protection Association would never let you

12:36.660 --> 12:40.720
activate that thermonuclear generator out there. It's far too dangerous. We call it the Sun.

12:44.420 --> 12:50.200
If we're going to have a hundred billion years future, we've got to get off this ball and we better do it

12:50.200 --> 12:54.520
pretty quick because it's fairly obvious that if we stay cooked up here on it long enough, we're going to do

12:54.520 --> 13:01.980
something to ourselves that will keep us from going out there. So that's why some of us like me seem to

13:01.980 --> 13:08.820
get a little shrill about it sometimes. It's a feeling of urgency here because right now we have the resources.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.320
Who knows how long we'll have them?

13:12.220 --> 13:17.760
Yeah, I was wondering is there some sort of timetable that we're sort of set into in getting into space?

13:19.180 --> 13:22.600
Well, I don't know what you mean by timetable set into. Who would set it?

13:22.600 --> 13:31.580
Well, are there any sort of resources, restrictions that would allow us to get into space now but maybe not later on?

13:32.740 --> 13:40.900
Pure population pressures. If you believe in the limits to growth model, we don't have very many more generations as well.

13:42.380 --> 13:53.280
If you believe those models, you're going to have tremendous pressures to widely distribute the capital.

13:53.940 --> 14:03.820
Right? At the moment, Western civilization is a fairly wealthy island in the middle of a pretty large sea of poverty.

14:05.360 --> 14:12.540
Very enormous pressures to sort of redistribute the wealth and if you do then everybody is more or less measurable.

14:12.700 --> 14:19.760
There will be very little wealth. Now, it's unlikely we're going to actually do that because very few people really

14:19.760 --> 14:27.240
popperize themselves voluntarily. But on the other hand, that's a pretty ripe situation for breeding wars.

14:28.380 --> 14:34.780
Bringing back the code of enium by the way. My suspicion is that the United States and the Soviet Union was rather a lot,

14:34.960 --> 14:42.280
the so-called third world countries, from impoverishing them then you see what I'm getting at.

14:42.660 --> 14:42.780
Right.

14:44.200 --> 14:56.480
Genuine foreign aid is, the United States has a fairly good record of generosity on that but it is still fairly small compared to our national budget.

14:56.800 --> 15:06.280
We do not give until it hurts much. So are we likely to? Nor do I think we should because if we impoverish ourselves,

15:06.440 --> 15:10.880
no one will have the resources to go to space. That's a very expensive proposition going to space, right?

15:10.880 --> 15:23.820
It takes a peculiar combination of extra wealth of educated people, high talent, machine jobs, the resources and the determination by somebody to do it.

15:23.900 --> 15:30.660
All of those things have to come together at the same time and that just seems sufficiently fragile to me.

15:30.660 --> 15:48.280
In fact, the whole civilization seems fairly fragile to me. Roberto Vaca wrote a pretty good book called The Cutting Dark Age in which he discusses a number of fairly catastrophic scenarios

15:49.860 --> 15:52.440
guiding with, well, I don't know, widespread power failure.

15:54.520 --> 16:03.800
In which Western civilization just essentially sort of collapses back into a level approximating the, I don't know, 1900 to 1920 era.

16:04.920 --> 16:09.820
Everybody's reasonably well off but nobody's got a lot and there certainly isn't enough to go to space.

16:11.420 --> 16:19.220
A lot of autonomously small communities living off the land counters and so forth is a considerably decreasing population.

16:19.920 --> 16:30.640
As he says, going off and living in a country in small towns without modern convenience and everything is the sort of thing people do now for fun,

16:30.680 --> 16:37.500
but it's not very amusing as a way of life, but it may well be the way of life. You can easily see this kind of.

16:38.880 --> 16:44.380
Larry and I wrote a book called Lucifer's Hammer about a natural disaster that can bring about much the same kind of result.

16:46.340 --> 16:54.700
It's true that's a rare one. I doubt the other two are going to be whammed with a comet, but on the other hand, Alvarez at Berkeley,

16:55.080 --> 17:05.300
the business is a Nobel Prize in Business, where Berkeley has just come up with a fairly convincing proof that that's what happened to the dinosaur about 100 million years ago,

17:05.300 --> 17:09.300
because the earth really did get whammed with some big and it killed them all off.

17:10.520 --> 17:16.860
And furthermore, he seems to have demonstrated that it happens about every 100 million years and to last one half and a 100 million years ago,

17:18.040 --> 17:20.120
which doesn't mean it's going to happen this year.

17:21.600 --> 17:30.080
But I can think of a lot of wars to this general disorganization.

17:30.260 --> 17:34.300
We keep building bureaucratic structure until we can't support the weight of it any longer.

17:35.220 --> 17:40.580
That would use up all the resources that might take us to space and if they're gone, how do you get there?

17:41.980 --> 17:44.360
The interesting thing, I mean space is expensive.

17:44.740 --> 17:49.300
Each Apollo shot cost almost 15 days' supply of cigarettes.

17:51.840 --> 17:56.780
The amount of money that was spent on an Apollo would have kept the United States in liquor for a whole week.

17:58.380 --> 17:59.320
It's expensive.

18:00.400 --> 18:05.080
It's not very expensive compared to a lot of things we've heard, but it's still expensive.

18:06.940 --> 18:19.100
Even though there are some restrictions on us, you've talked about in your articles about that we can survive and if I might quote you,

18:19.160 --> 18:20.460
we can survive with style.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.040
How might that be brought about?

18:25.240 --> 18:28.280
Well, that can give you some off in the scenario.

18:29.000 --> 18:38.240
But we are trying to convince the President and the administration of this for essentially the same amount of money

18:38.240 --> 18:45.780
we're spending on the space program now, redirected slightly and with a little attitude, it isn't taking much.

18:46.640 --> 18:52.720
To give you the following scenario, we could have by 1988 a space industrial park,

18:54.280 --> 19:01.700
which is essentially a housekeeping satellite that has industrial facilities and power and oxygen.

19:03.300 --> 19:10.440
And with private companies could go up and put their own modules on to it to make things.

19:11.060 --> 19:14.700
And I give you some ideas of things you can make in space you can't make.

19:14.840 --> 19:19.240
The use of ethical drug processes are enormous in space.

19:19.240 --> 19:24.080
And some drugs like urokinase are worth a million dollars a kilogram.

19:25.540 --> 19:33.500
Now, you can make those in fairly large quantities in space because you get perfect mixing and you have good temperature controls

19:33.500 --> 19:43.160
and there's all kinds of reasons why space turns out to be a good place to do certain very high-value intrinsically low-eochemical processes.

19:43.160 --> 19:49.120
You can get yields that are thousands of times better than they are on Earth.

19:50.820 --> 20:01.140
Turbine blade magnets, people talk about ball bearings that's not so clear that you can actually profitably manufacture ball bearings in space

20:01.140 --> 20:02.300
because you're making them on Earth now.

20:02.300 --> 20:13.620
We don't play foam steels, ways of making steel beams that are shot through with air bubbles in such a way that you or I could take one of them up

20:13.620 --> 20:21.580
or things ten feet long by putting a carrier around with you, but it's just about as strong as if it were solid.

20:22.340 --> 20:26.460
So that sort of thing. Very long carbon speciality.

20:26.460 --> 20:39.540
There are a lot of products that we are fairly certain would be profitable, but fairly certainly it's not good enough that anybody's going to risk going to all the expense of doing that by themselves.

20:39.880 --> 20:48.640
But if you've got already the facility so that you're only having to spend, the private company's only having to spend the marginal cost of this,

20:48.760 --> 20:53.740
of adding their own module onto it and paying some rent to the government as a landlord,

20:54.960 --> 21:00.360
then it becomes a much more attractive proposition, particularly if you give them some decent tax breaks.

21:00.680 --> 21:10.520
Now this can all be in place by 1988, but by the year 2000 it can be manufacturing things in space from materials taken from mines on the moon.

21:12.280 --> 21:18.440
And all this at a level of US expenditure that is not large compared to what we're doing now.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.820
It's in the order of maybe ten or twelve billion a year.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.620
Small potatoes.

21:26.920 --> 21:36.340
In the United States, they spent like five percent of its national budget over a period of ten years on kind of a canal.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.280
Everybody believes that was a good thing to do. We did well by doing good.

21:42.280 --> 21:52.720
But we don't have to spend anything like that. Two and a half percent of our national budget on space over the next twenty years could probably make the whole world rich.

21:53.260 --> 21:56.080
Certainly could keep us fabulously wealthy.

21:58.700 --> 22:08.660
Because the... you were talking about when you begin to manufacture things using power from space and materials from the moon,

22:08.660 --> 22:11.940
you were talking about actual new wealth.

22:13.260 --> 22:19.760
Nothing that has never existed on this planet before. You're actually bringing wealth to this planet.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.800
And that's quite a thing.

22:24.120 --> 22:30.140
It's all very possible. I mean it's not dreams, it's not fantasy, it's nothing ridiculous about it.

22:32.020 --> 22:36.400
You have permanent moon base by the year 2000. You begin to get lunar colonies.

22:36.600 --> 22:41.080
I suspect that people would choose to live there. Some will. Some won't. Some will.

22:41.580 --> 22:49.920
I'm sure I could find five hundred highly qualified families that would be willing to move to the moon tomorrow.

22:50.380 --> 22:53.320
Knowing they'd never come back. They're very qualified people.

22:53.320 --> 22:56.740
I think very seriously about doing them myself.

22:57.520 --> 23:02.840
It's a new frontier and there are always people who fight frontier atmospheres.

23:04.400 --> 23:10.460
From there, the takeoff is clear. There's no going back from that.

23:12.520 --> 23:17.760
And we have then ensured that there is no single disaster. They wipe out the whole human race.

23:18.740 --> 23:24.040
It's taken a pretty good step towards fulfilling our national duty.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.120
Destiny is the human race.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.580
Building our hundred billion year future.

23:33.460 --> 23:39.220
And I would think that doing something like that would be attractive to the president.

23:39.220 --> 23:54.440
I mean my suspicion is that the statesman who put us in a space permanently would be remembered a lot longer than Isabella the Great and Prince Henry the navigator.

23:54.980 --> 23:59.920
I mean would literally be remembered through billions of years of human history.

24:00.120 --> 24:04.760
The man who put us permanently into space. Along with John Kennedy.

24:06.700 --> 24:13.520
This is a scene to me like a fairly attractive proposition for some statesman.

24:16.120 --> 24:20.160
And it does not seem to me like an unpopular idea with the public.

24:20.480 --> 24:25.800
Look at the sales. Is that what the Star Wars is still the biggest money maker of all time?

24:26.440 --> 24:27.040
Movie?

24:27.840 --> 24:33.320
Star Trek is still on in syndication 12, 14 years after the...

24:33.760 --> 24:34.620
This is ridiculous.

24:35.660 --> 24:42.020
There's no such thing as a science fiction book. I got books in print that have been going around for 10, 12 years.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.540
I'm a relative newcomer to the field.

24:45.100 --> 24:48.040
There are some science fiction books in print that are 30 years old.

24:48.540 --> 24:52.780
Now, who won the Pulitzer Prize for literature 12 years ago?

24:53.540 --> 24:55.160
I bet his book's not in print.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.960
You're not talking about something that's unpopular with the people of this country.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.680
I think high technology is very popular.

25:04.540 --> 25:07.980
And look, you took a good sale to Science Magazine now.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.840
They have a way you turn around it. A new Science Magazine.

25:13.400 --> 25:20.840
So it would seem to me that here's a monstrous opportunity for somebody to go out and do well by doing good.

25:20.840 --> 25:27.540
But become one of the most famous people in history by doing something that is politically very popular.

25:28.380 --> 25:31.000
God knows it didn't hurt John Kennedy any.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.400
The Man's Kind

25:45.400 --> 25:53.780
As you can tell from our conversation, Dr. Pranell is concerned with the future.

25:53.780 --> 26:00.880
His excitement about Man's Kind's future is expressed in his fiction such as The Janissaries and his latest book, King David's Spaceship.

26:01.380 --> 26:04.900
And in his nonfiction such as A Step Further Out, which I highly recommend.

26:06.720 --> 26:13.660
With the advent of the Space Shuttle, the opportunity to work in the space program and the newly forming space industries will be opening up to everyone.

26:14.440 --> 26:19.880
If you are interested in knowing more about what we discussed in this program, I suggest you contact the L5 Society.

26:19.880 --> 26:30.040
Their address is the L5 Society 1060 East Elm Street, Tucson, Arizona 85719.

26:30.760 --> 26:36.220
Student memberships are $15 and regular memberships are $20. Both include the monthly L5 newsletter.

26:44.680 --> 26:48.020
This is David Cruz. Darrell Lane. And David Carson.

26:49.080 --> 27:00.580
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, in conjunction with KOCVFM and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
