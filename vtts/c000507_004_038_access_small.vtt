00:01.740 --> 00:05.520
Oh, before you go, in fact, instead of writing it down, why don't you just tell us your

00:05.520 --> 00:08.460
name so we can edit this week and say so and so sad if we want to?

00:09.000 --> 00:14.900
Okay, I'm Gene Van Troyer and I'm a science fiction writer, as well as a writer of what

00:14.900 --> 00:16.080
is called science fiction poetry.

00:16.880 --> 00:25.820
Right now I also edit a mainstream literary magazine which features among quote unquote

00:25.820 --> 00:31.820
mainstream fiction and poetry, science fiction and science fiction poetry.

00:33.220 --> 00:38.060
Okay, can you just say then a few words about what science fiction poetry is,

00:38.200 --> 00:39.880
some of the classic examples perhaps?

00:40.680 --> 00:44.940
Well, I really can't say what science fiction poetry is in terms of a definition because

00:44.940 --> 00:50.620
no one has ever defined science fiction or poetry. So science fiction poetry has no real

00:50.620 --> 00:55.440
definition but I generally tend to class science fiction poetry as something containing

00:56.350 --> 01:04.260
an element which is usually associated with science fiction. In other words, a speculative

01:04.260 --> 01:11.780
element of outer space or of biology or of time or whatnot. So that's my loose definition.

01:13.020 --> 01:22.500
I think it was pointed out earlier that the epic of Gilgamesh would be nowadays considered to be

01:22.500 --> 01:28.740
fantastic poetry and it's important to realize that what we now are calling science fiction

01:28.740 --> 01:35.060
poetry has been written in the so-called mainstream for a long time. William Blake is a really primary

01:35.060 --> 01:42.040
example of someone who wrote mystical poetry but in order to do it he created alternate worlds

01:42.040 --> 01:49.540
and an ability to travel between this world or the world of London that he knew and his imaginary

01:50.440 --> 01:56.980
England which he called Albion. Well, that's fantasy, that's science fiction, that's alternate world

01:59.500 --> 02:06.280
imagination. In more modern times there's W. H. Auden who has written a number of poems which

02:06.280 --> 02:12.060
would be scientifically oriented as well as science fiction because they speculate about

02:12.060 --> 02:20.560
eventual results of scientific discoveries. One of the most striking examples of what I would

02:20.560 --> 02:25.120
call science fiction poetry is something that was done by Richard Wilbur, a well-established

02:25.120 --> 02:30.380
mainstream poet and this poem is called The Mind Reader. This is a poem about a person who actually

02:30.380 --> 02:35.680
reads minds and he makes his living by reading minds. Now, I don't think Richard Wilbur would call it

02:35.680 --> 02:40.420
science fiction although maybe in the back of his mind he's working with the idea that well this is

02:40.420 --> 02:46.460
usually a science fiction thing but it's really a very well done poem and the point about science

02:46.460 --> 02:52.820
fiction poetry and mainstream poetry is that to be a good poem a science fiction poem must first

02:52.820 --> 02:59.140
be a good poem okay and then content-wise it diverges from what we normally recognize or would

02:59.140 --> 03:05.880
normally class as mainstream poetry. But there would be nothing so much in terms of style that

03:05.880 --> 03:12.580
would differentiate. Any style can be used you can you can use it in very rigidly metered and rhymed

03:12.580 --> 03:21.160
poetic forms which we usually call traditional poetic forms, sestinas, sonnets, villainils

03:21.500 --> 03:30.300
and so forth or it can use the free verse or the modern poetic techniques that you would see

03:30.300 --> 03:33.340
say William Carlos Williams using or Charles Olson using.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.540
Talk about there was one more too I was going to ask and just slip my mind.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.740
Had something to do with Richard Wilbur or W.H.O.D. and the manner?

03:46.080 --> 03:50.100
No not with not with those examples something just about the form it's about poet

03:50.100 --> 03:51.360
science fiction poetry.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
The content?

03:56.200 --> 03:59.580
Well I sort of asked that already what you have to do with the content.

04:00.020 --> 04:04.540
Yeah the content would be as I said before the elements which we normally associate with

04:04.540 --> 04:11.260
science fiction or fantasy or speculative writing. Whether it be a spaceship or a time machine or

04:12.060 --> 04:17.660
a scientific discovery. Telephone ghosts as Bob Frazier pointed out earlier.

04:19.200 --> 04:24.440
I think one thing that's important to distinguish also is that science fiction poetry itself

04:25.520 --> 04:35.840
I think represents a refusion of science and poetry up until the last decade as a matter of fact.

04:35.900 --> 04:44.460
It was very vogue-ish very fattish for poets and poetry type people to view poetry and art and science

04:45.100 --> 04:54.100
as mutually exclusive and this is a totally artificial separation because poetic expression

04:54.660 --> 04:59.320
comes from the same wellsprings that the ordering process we see in science comes from.

04:59.420 --> 05:05.680
It's the need to put order on the universe. Well in the Renaissance you didn't see this really

05:05.680 --> 05:10.380
drastic split between science and art. They were viewed as being the same thing.

05:10.380 --> 05:15.020
But I mentioned William Blake earlier and it seems to me that around the time of William Blake

05:15.600 --> 05:20.060
disillusionment with the industrial revolution in science was already setting in and William Blake

05:20.060 --> 05:27.400
is rabidly anti-science and personally I feel that he was mistaken in this particular aspect but

05:27.400 --> 05:34.300
he looked around the world that he saw and things were terrible. People were enslaved almost by the

05:34.300 --> 05:39.600
industrial system and he was just rabidly opposed to it because it oppressed the spirit. It oppressed

05:39.600 --> 05:46.840
the soul. Well now I think this is a forerunner of the split that gradually grew from about the

05:46.840 --> 05:52.500
19th or the latter part of the 18th century up until the present time in the 20th century

05:52.500 --> 05:57.880
but it's gradually coming back together and you see a lot more science showing up in poetry and

05:57.880 --> 06:03.200
poets feeling much more confident about expressing things out of science in their poetry as well as

06:03.200 --> 06:08.980
scientists falling back on poetry to explicate things. Good okay I thought I wanted just two

06:08.980 --> 06:14.440
more brief ones. Would you say that most of the science fiction poetry being written today was in

06:14.440 --> 06:21.500
more narrative or more lyrically lyric and personal? A lot of the science fiction poetry that

06:22.400 --> 06:26.940
I've seen in science fiction magazines that I've looked at that have been published over the last

06:26.940 --> 06:32.860
50 years tends to be in a narrative form. A lot of poets and a lot of people who read poetry in

06:32.860 --> 06:38.600
science fiction identify poetry as just another form of poetry or another form of storytelling I

06:38.600 --> 06:46.600
should say and so a lot of it will be a narrative or in a narrative framework but it doesn't have to

06:46.600 --> 06:50.280
be in a narrative framework to be a science fiction poem and a lot of people especially

06:50.800 --> 06:56.920
well myself or Bob Frazier or other people who are in the SFPA or who are not in the SFPA are

06:56.920 --> 07:06.260
trying to use other forms modern forms lyrical forms free verse and so forth as a means of

07:06.260 --> 07:12.860
science fiction poetic expression. Okay just one more can you think just to maybe rehash or add

07:12.860 --> 07:17.420
something to what Bob Frazier said about some titles either anthologies individual poems books

07:17.420 --> 07:24.860
that people might go to if they want to read something? Well one the one collection of poems

07:24.860 --> 07:29.120
that comes to mind would be Richard Wilbur's mind reader and other poems. We see a lot of fantasy

07:29.120 --> 07:36.840
stuff in Richard Wilbur's work then he pointed out to Edward Lucy Smith's Holding Your Eight Hands

07:36.840 --> 07:44.040
there's also John Fairfax's Frontiers of Going which is a British book and contains primarily

07:44.040 --> 07:54.380
British writers but it's all space poetry as John Fairfax calls it and then what was what was the

07:55.180 --> 07:59.700
inside outer space by Vastai?

08:01.980 --> 08:08.640
Robert Vastai's yeah that would be that and then there was a book edited by Richard what was his

08:08.640 --> 08:15.980
name? Grossinger. Grossinger it was called EO and it was a series of poems that were subtitled

08:15.980 --> 08:20.540
a science fiction vision of Mars. No it was a series of small press books. Just a series of small

08:23.980 --> 08:29.340
press books. Okay a series of small press books called EO on themes that were primarily fantastic

08:29.340 --> 08:34.360
science fictional and whatnot. Well it's been around for quite a while it's only been in really in

08:34.360 --> 08:40.640
recent years that the term science fiction poetry came into usage I think about 1974 was when the

08:40.640 --> 08:47.180
term was first used and it was coined by well it wasn't coined by anybody but it was just used as a

08:47.180 --> 08:54.420
label by Peter Dillingham who was a nearly a prosodist and theorist of science fiction poetry

08:54.420 --> 08:59.400
and Stephen Gregg who edited Eternity Science Fiction which was the first science fiction magazine

08:59.400 --> 09:07.560
to really incorporate poetry as an integral part of its format. That's fine with me is anybody

09:07.560 --> 09:15.400
Bill or David want to ask anything? That's fine. Okay thank you very much. Thank you listen

09:15.400 --> 09:16.940
did you leave the information?
