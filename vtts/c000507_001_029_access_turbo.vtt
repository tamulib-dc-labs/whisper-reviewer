00:08.680 --> 00:12.620
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.440 --> 00:33.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.240
And here are your hosts.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.420
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

00:44.640 --> 00:50.520
Edward Bryant is on the forefront of the young writers who will likely shape the course of science fiction in the 80s and 90s.

00:50.660 --> 00:52.860
We asked Bryant his definition of science fiction.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.920
Science fiction is essentially the same as any other fiction.

00:57.100 --> 01:02.560
It's fiction about people, about characters, about the relationships between one character and another,

01:02.600 --> 01:05.680
or one character in a group, which may be society.

01:05.680 --> 01:14.440
With the difference from mainstream fiction being that in science fiction there is some sort of scientific or technological development,

01:14.440 --> 01:26.100
which is important to the story and which affects those human relationships between person and other person or person and people as a group.

01:26.980 --> 01:29.160
Bryant grew up on a ranch in Wyoming.

01:29.540 --> 01:32.840
After he completed graduate school, he began writing short stories.

01:32.840 --> 01:39.080
To date, he has published three collections of short stories, Among the Dead, Cinnabar, and Particle Theory.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.340
We asked Bryant why he prefers to work in the medium of the short story.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.200
It's not a matter of conscious choice.

01:45.460 --> 01:48.980
I write what I do because that is what I do.

01:51.220 --> 01:53.080
I plan to write novels.

01:53.420 --> 01:55.920
Of course, I've been planning to write novels for a long time.

01:55.920 --> 02:04.280
My publisher is expecting by October 1st a novel which was originally contracted in 1974,

02:05.370 --> 02:09.400
and this is a long while to be dithering about completing the book.

02:12.880 --> 02:20.960
Short stories have just always seemed to me the appropriate medium that I should work in.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.320
In some ways, I could agree.

02:24.600 --> 02:37.800
I feel like short stories are mini novels because I have often spent much more time in terms of working out the characterizations,

02:37.800 --> 02:40.100
the plots, and so forth and so on,

02:40.100 --> 02:46.760
than the amount of space in that short story would indicate.

02:48.300 --> 02:54.700
And there are stories of mine that seem to me to be almost compressed novels

02:54.700 --> 02:58.620
that under other circumstances, were I more a prolific writer,

02:58.620 --> 03:02.200
I probably could have expanded them out another 54,000 words

03:02.200 --> 03:07.140
and got a nice paperback original novel.

03:08.080 --> 03:12.320
But I like to work with the compression sometimes.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.860
I like to pack an incredible amount,

03:14.880 --> 03:16.700
which is a risk, of course,

03:16.700 --> 03:25.100
because I fully recognize that a lot of people who read my stuff

03:25.100 --> 03:28.940
don't care to deal in that sort of thing.

03:28.940 --> 03:32.300
They don't want to have to worry about putting that kind of energy

03:32.300 --> 03:38.960
into reading a short story that they might ordinarily apply to at least starting to approach a novel.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.340
Phoenix Without Ashes is Bryant's only novel published to date,

03:43.540 --> 03:45.640
and it's a collaboration with Harlan Ellison.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.640
We ask if he is planning to publish a novel eventually.

03:49.520 --> 03:54.880
I think, I really believe that there are things that I want to write about

03:54.880 --> 04:01.100
that I can treat much better as novels than I can as short stories.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.080
And I think I would do that.

04:03.360 --> 04:11.320
I think right now the bottleneck factor is that I haven't done a scratch novel that's worked.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.080
I've done Phoenix, which is a novelization.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.660
I've done Cinnabar, which is a sort of piecework novel

04:17.660 --> 04:21.660
made up of parts that were originally published as short stories.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.360
And I've done a 60,000-word novel,

04:25.360 --> 04:28.900
which remains in my files, has never been rewritten,

04:29.040 --> 04:30.580
has never been submitted professionally,

04:30.820 --> 04:32.400
is not science fiction or fantasy.

04:32.640 --> 04:37.480
It's the traditional college novel that editors know and abominate.

04:37.660 --> 04:40.000
They get thousands of them every year.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.860
They're the novels that people write just after college

04:42.860 --> 04:45.720
in which the young writer says,

04:45.880 --> 04:48.220
well, I have come of age in this society,

04:48.220 --> 04:51.120
and here are the wonderful truths that I have learned.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.020
And they put all this into fiction,

04:53.020 --> 04:55.980
and it's usually just pretty terrible stuff.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.600
More on Edward Bryant on our next show.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.400
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

05:08.400 --> 05:11.300
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:11.300 --> 05:14.540
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.040
And they're the favorite tourist Cannabis,

05:42.720 --> 05:43.000
who's a story maybe has to be listened to.

05:44.360 --> 05:44.520
And the background of the film,

06:00.180 --> 06:04.140
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

06:19.960 --> 06:25.240
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.620
And here are your hosts.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.300
This is Bill Vernon and David Carson.

06:36.580 --> 06:39.900
Science fiction writer Edward Bryant is the subject of today's show.

06:39.900 --> 06:45.440
Probably Bryant's most important contribution to date is his collection of connected stories called Cinnabar.

06:45.640 --> 06:50.140
Here Bryant tells something about the city of Cinnabar, the place around which the stories revolve.

06:50.900 --> 06:59.560
No matter whether it's a short story or a novel, and no matter how complex the ultimate product might be,

06:59.720 --> 07:05.040
originally there always is the single image somewhere along the line that everything else generated from.

07:05.040 --> 07:10.560
In the case of Cinnabar, I suppose the overriding image is the city itself.

07:11.060 --> 07:18.640
The city that exists presumably millions of years in our future and may or may not exist here on Earth.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.160
That's never really spelled out, nor did I feel it important to do so.

07:23.260 --> 07:29.600
Although I suspect to pin down, I would suggest that Cinnabar is probably very close to Phoenix, Arizona.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.180
I shouldn't be surprised.

07:32.980 --> 07:45.520
But in the late 1960s, I just had the image of the far future, very colorful, emerald city of Oz sort of apparition,

07:45.520 --> 07:47.760
wavering out there on the desert horizon.

07:47.760 --> 07:56.880
And of course, once the image was there, then all the questions of both fiction in general and science fiction in particular generated,

07:57.120 --> 08:00.660
such as, okay, what is that city all about?

08:00.800 --> 08:01.600
Who lives there?

08:01.720 --> 08:02.520
What do they do?

08:03.240 --> 08:11.560
I wanted to write about a city of such sophistication and decadence that science and technology,

08:11.560 --> 08:17.280
as Arthur C. Clarke put in a different context, might as well be magic.

08:18.540 --> 08:26.560
And I wanted to, in terms of the human element, investigate what would people do with their access to immortality,

08:26.720 --> 08:30.020
with their access to technological powers beyond compare?

08:30.880 --> 08:36.100
Would their lives be any less screwed up than they are now in 20th century America or not?

08:36.100 --> 08:41.140
So, again, I was going back to that original premise that I believe in,

08:41.320 --> 08:45.420
that good fiction is about people and their relationships.

08:46.240 --> 08:50.160
And if you have access to physical immortality, for example,

08:50.260 --> 08:54.540
how does this affect your relationship with the people that are closest to you

08:54.540 --> 08:57.260
and the people that you interact with every day on the street?

08:57.980 --> 09:02.000
And that's what Cinnabar finally is all about.

09:02.820 --> 09:05.960
Although Bryant conceived of the stories as separate entities,

09:06.260 --> 09:09.100
he eventually realized how closely tied they all are.

09:09.820 --> 09:12.040
And it came as a great surprise to me,

09:12.140 --> 09:17.540
as I wrote these stories about that fabulous city,

09:17.800 --> 09:24.400
that there was an all-over structure that seemed to be coming out independent of each individual story.

09:24.400 --> 09:29.400
And that's why when you read the stories all together in a book,

09:29.600 --> 09:33.560
I feel there is a clear-cut beginning and a clear-cut ending,

09:33.600 --> 09:38.340
and there is progress made through the stories,

09:38.520 --> 09:42.940
almost as though one were reading a from-scratch novel,

09:43.160 --> 09:44.760
even though, of course, it isn't.

09:45.020 --> 09:49.120
I weasel a lot with the definition of what is a novel there and what isn't.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.180
Still, the background is the same from story to story.

09:53.340 --> 09:56.160
Most of the characters are the same from story to story.

09:57.180 --> 10:00.060
The origin of the name Cinnabar is an interesting story.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.940
Here Bryant tells us what inspired it.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.100
Now, the city title,

10:07.020 --> 10:11.580
strangely enough, came originally from a photograph of a horse.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.560
My mother, in her living room,

10:15.760 --> 10:20.780
has a beautiful photograph of the head of a Palomino.

10:22.060 --> 10:25.660
This was a picture she told me about when I was growing up

10:25.660 --> 10:28.640
because this was the horse that she used to ride in the summers

10:28.640 --> 10:32.100
out at a dude ranch in upstate New York called Cinnabar.

10:33.380 --> 10:36.180
And I'd always loved the sound of the word.

10:36.180 --> 10:39.600
It conjured up all sorts of images for me

10:39.600 --> 10:43.740
that I think went far beyond your standard upstate New York dude ranch.

10:44.540 --> 10:47.580
More on Edward Bryant's Cinnabar next time.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:57.720 --> 11:00.420
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:00.420 --> 11:03.660
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:19.260 --> 11:19.500
Per previous year,

11:19.500 --> 11:19.520
from nowhere to start the matter.

11:19.580 --> 11:19.840
Cookies on the wp-seastern redife,

11:19.840 --> 11:19.860
The data on volume of depressions

11:19.860 --> 11:19.960
So it's way too far below it.

11:20.180 --> 11:26.620
Oh, no, it's so fake,

11:26.620 --> 11:26.880
so it's not that Wendy andرك Bauar,

11:26.880 --> 11:26.940
I'll connect with thatweed like my own.'

11:35.920 --> 11:36.160
You can call that asけれ Fresh or you can

11:44.240 --> 11:48.140
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:03.900 --> 12:09.220
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.620
And here are your hosts.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.460
This is David Carson and Bill Vernon.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.260
Our show today centers again on the Cinnabar stories by Edward Bryant.

12:24.760 --> 12:31.180
In the acknowledgments of Cinnabar, Bryant writes to Joan Bernat, who pioneered in the writing of Cinnabar stories.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.420
Here he explains this acknowledgment.

12:34.040 --> 12:39.360
Joan Bernat was a very good writer who did a number of stories at the early Clarion workshops,

12:39.400 --> 12:43.640
which were published in various anthologies, and I have no idea where she is now.

12:43.640 --> 12:51.540
But at one point in the workshop, we'd done an exercise in which each of us came up with various narrative hooks,

12:51.780 --> 12:56.620
first lines of stories which were calculated to catch the interest of the reader.

12:57.300 --> 13:08.620
And I had done a story hook which went along the lines of, oh, I think the road to Cinnabar was lined with the shells of burnt-out school buses.

13:09.780 --> 13:16.420
And I had no particular reason for coming up with this line other than, to me it was interesting,

13:16.420 --> 13:20.880
and also this was vaguely tied in with my image of Cinnabar the city.

13:20.880 --> 13:27.140
Well, a number of people in the workshop borrowed other people's narrative hooks and wrote stories around them.

13:27.240 --> 13:34.400
And Joan Bernat actually did the first Cinnabar story in the sense that she wrote a story which started with that line.

13:35.960 --> 13:41.720
And her Cinnabar was not quite the same as mine, but still there was something of the feeling about it,

13:41.720 --> 13:50.240
the almost surrealistic image of the city wavering on the horizon of the city which is totally cut off from the entire rest of the world.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.920
In fact, for all intents and purposes, is the entire world.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.780
And so that's why Joan Bernat got the acknowledgement at the beginning of the book.

13:59.200 --> 14:04.980
The stories collected in Cinnabar are not the only Cinnabar stories. Others have been published elsewhere.

14:04.980 --> 14:09.360
We asked Brian if he has plans to write still other stories in the Cinnabar milieu.

14:10.120 --> 14:15.960
I've thought about it. I have notes on several Cinnabar stories,

14:16.100 --> 14:26.000
including the possibility of doing five novelettes which would come together as another make-up novel about the character Jade Blue.

14:26.420 --> 14:34.500
My publisher and I would like to do a new edition of Cinnabar with a brand new Cinnabar story in it.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.520
But I don't know. I just haven't been able to do a Cinnabar story.

14:39.640 --> 14:46.500
It may be that its time has passed in terms of my own professional nature.

14:48.140 --> 14:53.640
The Cinnabar stories that I've got planned out would take place before the time of the stories in the book itself

14:53.640 --> 14:58.760
because, of course, at the end of the book, I don't think I'm giving away any plot secrets here.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.300
Cinnabar is in the process of being destroyed.

15:01.920 --> 15:08.400
And I've had no desire to write stories about Cinnabar after the fall.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.980
But before, there are still possibilities.

15:10.980 --> 15:21.640
I would like to do, for example, a story about a man in Cinnabar who comes up with the greatest decadent luxury anyone could have.

15:21.640 --> 15:31.600
I thought for a long time about what single luxury would be the most decadent, the most useless example of conspicuous affluence.

15:31.800 --> 15:38.460
And I realized, of course, that probably what would be comprised in that would be having your own roller coaster.

15:39.340 --> 15:46.660
I mean, think how decadent to have your own roller coaster sitting out behind your house, which only you used or your friends, of course.

15:46.980 --> 15:53.320
And so I immediately, because I love roller coasters a lot, started to design my own version of the ultimate roller coaster.

15:53.320 --> 16:01.000
And that is going to be the central image in that particular story, if it's ever written.

16:01.440 --> 16:10.300
Another Cinnabar story, which is yet unwritten, is what happens when Tourmaline Hayes decides to have an enormous party

16:10.300 --> 16:16.900
at which she invites every single one of her old lovers, of which she has quite a few.

16:17.640 --> 16:25.920
And this will simply be a party at which you have no idea whether it's going to be a romantic comedy or a murder mystery.

16:26.220 --> 16:27.880
A lot of possibilities there.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.280
In our next show, we'll talk more about Edward Bryant.

16:38.640 --> 16:44.080
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian-Mason Science Fiction Association,

16:44.080 --> 16:47.340
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:29.620 --> 17:30.680
According to Ed Hickman's Society, that's so interesting.

17:30.680 --> 17:31.000
It'll be a part of a학 campus, as we'd like over five years down,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.180
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show!

17:33.320 --> 17:34.400
So stay with us!

17:50.220 --> 17:55.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:58.260 --> 17:59.900
And here are your hosts.

18:04.340 --> 18:06.660
This is David Carson and Bill Vernon.

18:06.980 --> 18:10.380
Today we continue with our interview with science fiction author Edward Bryant.

18:10.380 --> 18:16.120
Those who are at all familiar with Bryant's work have certainly come across his apparent fascination with sharks.

18:16.460 --> 18:22.600
Here he explains how this attraction was spawned, then how it led to the famous short story titled simply Shark.

18:23.620 --> 18:24.660
Why sharks?

18:26.540 --> 18:37.420
You know, when people visit my apartment, they see all sorts of shark paraphernalia, you know, jaws mounted on backboards and shark mobiles, shark paintings and so forth and so on.

18:38.360 --> 18:53.580
The reason for the shark motif and the reason that I suppose I've adopted the shark as a sort of totem is because in the early 70s, one of my closest friends had dreamed the night before.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.340
She told me about this at breakfast, that she had been in the body of a shark.

18:58.660 --> 19:02.960
She had seen the world through shark colored lenses.

19:05.160 --> 19:10.540
And we talked about this for a while, you know, got past the obvious Freudian symbolism of it all.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.600
And I was fascinated by the dream.

19:14.960 --> 19:21.240
Then she catalyzed action by saying, listen, why don't you write a story about sharks?

19:21.520 --> 19:23.180
Now, I didn't know anything about sharks.

19:23.180 --> 19:26.320
I was just an inland boy who'd grown up far from the sea.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.980
And although the ocean has always fascinated me, I didn't know about sharks.

19:30.160 --> 19:33.320
But I did my research, just as with, say, particle theory.

19:33.480 --> 19:34.980
I found out about sharks.

19:34.980 --> 19:42.280
I became intrigued by their position in the evolutionary scheme of things, how incredibly well developed they are.

19:42.280 --> 19:57.400
And I was also struck by such images as the fact that the shark is the major species of creature which is hostile to human beings, which is in no danger of extinction, at least at this point.

19:58.140 --> 20:08.060
So I took my friend's original dream and I said, okay, I've got a character who wants to be a shark.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.380
Why does she want to be a shark?

20:10.580 --> 20:14.660
How does she become a shark, both metaphorically and literally?

20:14.980 --> 20:18.360
And that's how the original shark story generated.

20:19.540 --> 20:30.820
I realized after finishing the story that there were other things that involved sharks that I had not dealt with in the story that I would treat in various other pieces.

20:38.700 --> 20:44.120
When Bryant's friends got wind of his newfound fascination, he began to be bombarded with shark mementos.

20:44.820 --> 20:51.620
What happened then, of course, was the older you get, I think the harder you are to shop for your friends and relatives.

20:51.940 --> 20:53.140
They don't know what to get you.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.720
They don't know what your tastes are.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.780
They don't know what books you've read or what albums you don't have.

20:59.880 --> 21:05.860
So somehow the shark story caught the fancy of the people around me and I started giving me shark paraphernalia.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.980
Before I knew it, I had more sharks than I knew what to do with.

21:09.620 --> 21:18.100
I'm glad it was sharks because, jaws notwithstanding, there never has been that much in the way of shark artifacts for sale.

21:18.300 --> 21:26.100
If it had been unicorns or dragons, say, I would have been swamped completely and utterly and I could have knick-knack and gee-gaw garage sales.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.620
But instead, I've got some pretty neat shark stuff.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.020
Does Bryant really like sharks?

21:32.820 --> 21:37.940
I would say, though, that people ask me, do I really like sharks?

21:38.080 --> 21:39.440
And I have to admit, I don't like sharks.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.700
Nobody likes sharks.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.060
But I respect sharks.

21:44.020 --> 21:50.040
And sharks as an emblem, as a symbol, truly do fascinate me.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.820
And I expect there will be other shark stories.

21:53.260 --> 21:54.960
There may even be a shark novel.

21:54.960 --> 22:00.640
What militates against a shark novel, of course, quite aside from any of my own feelings about writing a novel,

22:00.840 --> 22:10.000
is I probably have to wait for the furor of Peter Benchley's jaws to continue dying down.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.260
More on Edward Bryant on our next show.

22:20.380 --> 22:25.860
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:26.140 --> 22:29.140
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

22:48.740 --> 22:59.120
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

23:15.320 --> 23:19.300
coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:35.100 --> 23:40.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.880
And here are your hosts.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.620
This is David Carson.

23:50.660 --> 23:51.340
And Bill Vernon.

23:51.600 --> 23:56.460
In the fall of 1981, Edward Bryant's important short story collection, Particle Theory, was published.

23:56.740 --> 23:58.600
It contains memorable stories.

23:58.920 --> 24:03.960
The Thermals of August, the Nebula Award-winning Giants, the often reprinted Shark,

24:04.400 --> 24:06.760
the Hibakusha Gallery, and the Tidal Story.

24:06.960 --> 24:13.240
The story Particle Theory is unique in Bryant's canon in that its background is heavily laden with hard science.

24:13.240 --> 24:19.040
Here he explains how any writer can get across hard science ideas if he uses the right resources.

24:19.960 --> 24:24.460
Particle Theory came about because I read a newspaper article about pion beam therapy

24:25.580 --> 24:31.100
using a stream of solid particles, subnuclear particles, to attack cancerous tumors,

24:31.140 --> 24:37.060
which I have just found out is a line of research that has just been abandoned down at Los Alamos.

24:37.060 --> 24:44.020
I'm not sure why, whether it's funding cutbacks or whether they've simply found better means to attack the medical problem.

24:44.200 --> 24:51.440
But at any rate, what had intrigued me a number of years ago in the paper is now apparently scientifically dead.

24:51.440 --> 24:57.280
And yeah, this is more of a hard science story than I customarily write,

24:57.700 --> 25:03.700
but I think it exhibits a more general principle,

25:03.820 --> 25:11.900
which is that I or every other writer who may not be all that soundly based in science and technology

25:11.900 --> 25:21.100
by discipline or by vocation need simply only use the research tools that we all presumably learned in junior high

25:21.100 --> 25:28.060
to get across a hard science story without being overly didactic about it.

25:28.220 --> 25:32.380
What I discovered in this story was that the world is full of experts

25:32.380 --> 25:35.500
who were quite willing to share with me their specialized knowledge,

25:35.500 --> 25:40.640
whether it was particle beam physics or whether it was the landscape around Los Alamos

25:40.640 --> 25:45.520
and little details for verisimilitude,

25:45.520 --> 25:48.760
such as what airline do you fly into Los Alamos on

25:48.760 --> 25:52.340
and what sort of planes are you in and all of that kind of thing.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.180
Bryant comments here on the fact that he does not wish to be typecast as a writer of any particular type of story.

25:58.980 --> 26:02.780
True. Ordinarily I don't use quite so much scientific content.

26:02.780 --> 26:07.480
All I can say is this was one of the stories in which that content seemed appropriate.

26:08.540 --> 26:17.960
And it exhibits my own, in a sense, my own sense of frustration with being typecast.

26:18.520 --> 26:25.840
I write what I like to write and sometimes that may be a story which is full of medical research

26:25.840 --> 26:32.160
about prostate cancer and particle beam therapy for that cancer.

26:32.160 --> 26:36.320
And cosmology, all that.

26:37.140 --> 26:44.940
And other times I will write science fiction stories in which there is not a speck of hard research or hard fact.

26:45.940 --> 26:51.220
Again, I suppose it illustrates the difference between facts and truths, to be facile about it.

26:53.020 --> 26:57.320
But it also shows that good research can cover a multitude of sins.

26:57.660 --> 27:03.140
He maintains that even with the hard science elements, particle theory is still a people story.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.680
This story for me is still a people story, first and foremost.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.940
It's, again, about relationships of people.

27:10.480 --> 27:17.660
And the scientific content amplifies, illustrates, and I hope clarifies those relationships.

27:18.020 --> 27:23.160
But, by God, the people still come first and the science and technology come second.

27:29.340 --> 27:33.740
Bryant's first published short story collection, Among the Dead, came out in 1973.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.140
It contains a number of stories written early in his career.

27:37.400 --> 27:43.300
His novel, Phoenix Without Ashes, is in fact a novelization of Harlan Ellison's original pilot script

27:43.300 --> 27:46.540
for the ill-fated television series, The Star Lost.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.100
This work is a rarity.

27:48.100 --> 27:53.020
As a novelization, which came after the fact, it is actually a solid piece of work.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.780
The planned sequels have never materialized.

27:56.120 --> 27:59.440
Certainly, Edward Bryant has established himself as a top-flight writer,

27:59.580 --> 28:02.640
who happens also to work under the label science fiction.

28:10.060 --> 28:12.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:12.800 --> 28:15.600
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:15.600 --> 28:18.940
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
