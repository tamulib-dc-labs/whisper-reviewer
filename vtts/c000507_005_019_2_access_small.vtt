00:01.400 --> 00:03.700
I can't remember that there was particularly.

00:03.940 --> 00:08.360
I remember when I first started to write, I was in New York and I was on the beach from

00:08.360 --> 00:10.460
the ship and I needed money badly.

00:10.620 --> 00:15.060
I went to see an editor and he gave me an assignment for a sports story and I've never

00:15.060 --> 00:19.900
been a sports addict and it had to do with basketball and I didn't know basketball at

00:19.900 --> 00:20.160
all.

00:21.100 --> 00:25.800
But he had given me an assignment and I was going to get my $40, which is what they paid

00:25.800 --> 00:26.380
in those days.

00:26.990 --> 00:32.140
I was hard at work at it and the idea for Beyond the Sands came in flat-wise and I said

00:32.140 --> 00:33.700
in effect go away, I'm busy.

00:34.280 --> 00:40.560
And the idea came back again and I said well finally oh alright and I wrote it in about

00:40.560 --> 00:41.600
three hours that's all.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.540
Just to get it out of my way and then I finished the sports story which I sold eventually.

00:47.860 --> 00:52.980
But I put that manuscript in the bottom drawer and I knew I had a very unusual story here

00:52.980 --> 00:54.720
and I kept it like one of the family tools.

00:55.200 --> 00:59.780
And in about three years I got hungry enough to say well I got to sell the family jewels

00:59.780 --> 01:02.220
and I found my amazement I couldn't give the story away.

01:02.420 --> 01:06.460
It was nearly ten years before anybody would look seriously at it.

01:06.540 --> 01:11.080
But in the meantime where I submitted it, it made, well there were two occasions, once

01:11.080 --> 01:12.340
an editor and once an agent.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.920
They said bring your stuff around and let's have a look at it.

01:15.060 --> 01:19.120
You know, I'd come around on Tuesday, I'd go in on Tuesday and the secretary would say

01:19.120 --> 01:22.920
go on in there and you had a guy sitting there and he's crumbling with anger.

01:23.140 --> 01:23.520
He's furious.

01:24.060 --> 01:27.720
He says here take this step, once you push it off onto the floor I had to pick it up.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.860
Take this stuff and get out of here.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.340
I don't want to deal with anybody writing this story like Bianca's.

01:32.740 --> 01:33.460
Get out of here.

01:33.640 --> 01:33.940
Why?

01:34.100 --> 01:34.480
What's the matter?

01:35.020 --> 01:36.080
What do you say to that?

01:36.360 --> 01:38.020
Never mind, I don't want to talk about it.

01:39.020 --> 01:45.640
And you know I left very hurt and very puzzled and not knowing what was going on with these

01:45.640 --> 01:45.980
people.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.760
Anyway finally a friend of mine wrote to me from England that there was a literary contest

01:50.760 --> 01:56.800
in England in a magazine called Argosy and the deadline was New Year's Eve.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.900
Well I got his letter at Christmas Eve so I dug this thing out of the trunk and ran

02:00.900 --> 02:05.700
it through the cup without changing anything and sent it off and it must have arrived within

02:05.700 --> 02:06.660
a minute to the deadline.

02:07.300 --> 02:12.400
And it won the contest and I beat Graham Greene and John Pudney and a number of famous people

02:13.160 --> 02:18.920
and got the first check I'd ever seen for over a thousand dollars and got much glory

02:18.920 --> 02:19.500
out of it.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.620
And it too has been reprinted a great number of times.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.520
But that's the backstory on that.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.000
But where the idea came from I cannot really tell you.

02:31.320 --> 02:37.820
Okay, I guess this is sort of an obvious observation but let me make it anyhow.

02:37.900 --> 02:42.260
I would suppose that in your fiction you're much more concerned with mankind's psychological

02:42.260 --> 02:44.520
future than is technological's future.

02:44.520 --> 02:55.600
Yeah, I think they're intertwined but my interest in technology is intense and I keep up as much

02:55.600 --> 02:58.960
as anybody can with new developments in science and technology.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.800
But yes, it is a human quantum that's of greatest importance to me.

03:04.340 --> 03:09.360
I'm fascinated by human beings as long as it's if I wasn't exactly one of them and kept

03:09.360 --> 03:12.740
on investigating to find out what made them tick.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.000
You're also optimistic about man's future, aren't you?

03:17.480 --> 03:19.720
Yes, I have an ultimate faith.

03:20.240 --> 03:23.760
I think things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.

03:24.760 --> 03:31.040
But I have enough faith in the human animal to feel that after a hundred years and more

03:31.040 --> 03:35.500
of this and watching and stepping and dressing alike that you'll crack out of it and spread

03:35.500 --> 03:36.260
its wings again.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.300
And this time in a much better way than ever before.

03:41.380 --> 03:46.240
It's so stupid nations act in ways that would not be permitted in any well run kindergarten.

03:47.220 --> 03:52.560
You know, squabbling and grabbing and punching each other and bullying and so on.

03:53.560 --> 03:57.660
I mean you can see it in the microcosm in a kindergarten class.

03:59.620 --> 04:02.280
And the nations are behaving exactly the same way.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.520
And this time it looks like they're picking wipes all off.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.420
They have that capability.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.000
Still, as I say, I have faith in humanity at home.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.040
Okay, Mr. Sturgeon, I don't have too many more.

04:16.140 --> 04:16.820
Are you still doing okay?

04:17.260 --> 04:17.680
Oh, yes.

04:18.100 --> 04:18.380
Okay.

04:18.960 --> 04:19.620
I just forever.

04:20.000 --> 04:20.640
Hang on a second.

04:20.900 --> 04:21.020
Yeah.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.560
I got a perennial frog in my throat.

04:29.220 --> 04:30.380
Okay, what else do you got?

04:30.380 --> 04:36.820
Okay, what changes have you seen in science fiction since you began writing back in the

04:37.260 --> 04:37.520
30s?

04:37.580 --> 04:41.300
Oh, well I've seen a tremendous amount of change.

04:42.640 --> 04:49.020
But one thing I think has largely to the impact of fantasy and science fiction magazine and

04:49.020 --> 04:53.700
Anthony Boucher and that kind of thing has stayed with that magazine all along.

04:54.680 --> 05:03.740
Where it led in people who had real literary abilities that they were afraid to show when

05:03.740 --> 05:08.960
it was just back in the hammer and Russian hard healing of the pulp era.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.880
People began to write things that they really felt.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.720
They write it in a higher literary style.

05:17.140 --> 05:19.680
That too can be called a pulp magazine.

05:19.680 --> 05:27.240
But my goodness, Tony began including poetry in it and a great deal of erudition and philosophical

05:27.240 --> 05:34.360
ideas and poetic notions and the kind of fantasy that preceded Tolkien.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.060
And that was a huge influence on the field and it has now spread all through the field.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.780
Some of the writing you find in science fiction is fine.

05:43.780 --> 05:47.840
It's fine with any writing done anywhere in the whole world in any era.

05:49.960 --> 05:54.740
Latter-day Navajo was just about on the top level of literature.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.420
His last novel was a science fiction novel.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.000
A lot of people don't realize that.

05:59.420 --> 06:04.500
It's called Eta and it has to do with the world in which the Germans had won the First World War

06:04.500 --> 06:06.560
and the things that happened to the world after that.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.860
It was purely an alternate universe story.

06:13.060 --> 06:15.540
The other thing that's happened, of course, is women.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.600
There have always been women in science fiction.

06:18.800 --> 06:23.260
As a matter of fact, somebody who started science fiction as we know it was a woman,

06:23.740 --> 06:27.140
a lady who wrote Frankenstein as she was a teenager.

06:27.580 --> 06:30.620
If I had a time machine, I would go back and talk to that lady.

06:32.180 --> 06:33.420
She must have been something else.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.720
Amazing woman. Amazing.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.420
I think she was 19 when she wrote Frankenstein.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.200
Mary Shelley.

06:44.080 --> 06:48.640
But the women who have been into science fiction, one of the very best was Judy Merrill.

06:48.980 --> 06:51.620
Back in the 40s, she wrote some of the...

06:51.620 --> 06:55.280
Well, if you look in the Hall of Fame of Science Fiction, you'll find a Judy Merrill story in there

06:55.740 --> 07:00.420
called That Only a Mother, which was not only...

07:00.420 --> 07:04.420
It was not only a Judy Merrill story, but it was the first story she'd ever written,

07:04.720 --> 07:06.000
the first sale she ever made.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.060
She told her first story, and that was it.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.880
This extraordinary story. Really powerful.

07:13.200 --> 07:18.440
Then there are people, like I just mentioned, that wild seed, for example,

07:18.640 --> 07:23.680
there's a lovely story, there's Ursula K. Le Guin, who has won a National Book Award.

07:24.360 --> 07:29.180
There's Doris Baceric here, whose ideas are always so totally unexpected.

07:30.380 --> 07:33.400
There's Elizabeth and then there's...

07:34.160 --> 07:35.620
Oh, on and on and on.

07:35.960 --> 07:39.920
There are women in science fiction, or just extraordinary.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.680
Remember, Lady and DeToy said to me that up to now it's been...

07:47.000 --> 07:51.020
The woman has to work twice as hard and be twice as good as a man

07:51.020 --> 07:52.600
before she can get the same recognition.

07:53.780 --> 07:58.360
Then she added, fortunately, that's not difficult, which is a great lie.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.920
But I admire the women in science fiction so very much.

08:03.740 --> 08:07.480
Somebody said recently that there are so many excellent women in science fiction

08:07.480 --> 08:10.860
that at long last it's possible to say that they found a mediocre one.

08:11.300 --> 08:15.900
And it has been true. They've had to be better than the men to get where they are.

08:15.900 --> 08:21.680
One of the great revelations in science fiction, of course, you no problem know about it, was James Tiptree.

08:22.840 --> 08:23.320
Yes.

08:24.440 --> 08:31.300
Who turns out after having a shattering success to be a lady by the name of Alice Sheldon.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.800
That was the greatest acknowledgement to a lot of people.

08:35.440 --> 08:41.940
She kept her head under her wing for so long that all sorts of rumors started that she was a CIA man,

08:41.940 --> 08:47.500
or that she was a collaboration between Jerry Portell and somebody else or something.

08:49.140 --> 08:53.160
But no, sir, she's her own man. She's good. Oh, she's good.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.680
That's Kate Wilhelm, a writer, beautiful, steady prose. Very, very good.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.880
That's the name of Night's wife.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.320
So I'm more pleased than almost anything else about science fiction

09:06.320 --> 09:10.840
that has led the women in to such a total degree.

09:11.320 --> 09:19.220
And they're good. Almost every single one of them really got something unique to bring to the field and to literature as a whole.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.060
I'm fascinated by women. I love the way they think.

09:23.680 --> 09:32.100
There is a difference. But I'm not talking just equality, because there is a difference between the way men think and the way women do.

09:33.420 --> 09:45.160
And so I'm utterly fascinated by the way women think, which leads us back to the whole business of ESP and the qualities of the developing mind.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.340
I think women have shown certain qualities way, way ahead of the rest of it.

09:53.160 --> 10:03.120
Okay. Are you disappointed, though, that science fiction has sort of remained as a separate genre, that it's not recognized as combined with mainstream literature?

10:03.580 --> 10:09.460
Well, in a way it is. If you look at mainstream literature these days, you'll find that science fiction is permeating it.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.460
I have a feeling that the whole business of science fiction being in separate fields is shaped pretty much like the handle of a suitcase.

10:16.460 --> 10:22.280
That is, in the mid-twenties, it began to come out of the main body of literature.

10:23.280 --> 10:27.680
And it got stronger and thicker, and it's going right back in again where it came from.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.820
But it's going to color everything it touches, and it already has.

10:30.940 --> 10:34.660
I have just mentioned, for example, that Vladimir Nabokov's last novel.

10:36.520 --> 10:45.000
There's people like Marquette who won the Pulitzer Prize last year for a fascinating book called The Century of Longinus.

10:48.840 --> 10:54.620
There's people who are recognized as literatures like Kurt Vonnegut who has never written anything but science fiction.

10:55.460 --> 11:02.480
Although he refused to have the word used on any of his books or contracts because he didn't want to be tainted by that particular ghetto,

11:03.320 --> 11:07.560
Ray Bradbury came up out of the science fiction field in regard to his most foremost literature.

11:10.080 --> 11:16.780
Yeah, science fiction is becoming the mainstream.

11:17.280 --> 11:23.740
Really, look at all the pictures that came out last year, for example, last summer with a heavy emphasis on science fiction.

11:24.320 --> 11:29.220
People are beginning to realize that this forefront thinking is predictive or precognitive thinking.

11:30.100 --> 11:39.080
It's of some moment that a lot of people who would not recognize it in 1984 was the science fiction novel until very recently.

11:40.300 --> 11:49.660
I mean, things the Amos once wrote that the reaction to the general public and the so-called serious critic to science fiction is,

11:49.780 --> 11:54.560
hey, this is good, this can't be science fiction, or hey, this is science fiction, it can't be good.

11:55.640 --> 11:59.000
And this is the ghetto that science fiction had to grow up in.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.760
But if you can survive in a ghetto, you generally come out strong.

12:03.980 --> 12:06.660
And I think that's the case with science fiction now.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.320
But I stuck with it not because I couldn't write other kinds of things,

12:11.340 --> 12:16.640
but probably because I love the field and the freedom that it gives me.

12:18.680 --> 12:23.060
Okay, excellent. You've written before, I guess you still agree with this, that science fiction is wisdom.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.280
Did I write that?

12:25.920 --> 12:26.320
Yes.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.880
Yeah, I think that's true.

12:29.620 --> 12:32.120
I don't remember writing that, but I did.

12:33.340 --> 12:34.500
Yes, I think it is.

12:35.420 --> 12:43.260
And as I said, my trademark is the letter Q of the arrow through it, which is, ask the next question, and essentially that's how wisdom is acquired.

12:44.960 --> 12:49.060
I think you were talking about the derivation of the word science, the Greek base of it.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.640
That's true. Yeah, that's right.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.520
Okay, I guess it's...

12:55.520 --> 12:56.740
It wasn't wisdom, it was knowledge.

12:57.780 --> 12:58.300
Okay.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.000
Scientia means knowledge, yeah.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.740
Wisdom is something that knowledge applies.

13:04.940 --> 13:07.060
I think that defines wisdom pretty well.

13:08.180 --> 13:13.000
It's interesting too that wisdom is something that...

13:13.000 --> 13:20.640
And it pragmatically changes as the times change, that it's to say what is wise in one era is not wise in another.

13:22.700 --> 13:27.160
It's wise now, for example, to ask the next question and the one that follows and the one that follows.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.680
Time was when you could burn to the stake for that.

13:32.660 --> 13:36.380
Okay, how much science fiction are you writing these days?

13:40.340 --> 13:42.980
Well, not a heck of a lot at the moment.

13:43.980 --> 13:51.120
I'm involved at the moment in a tremendous script, six sides of an LP for Cadman Records.

13:53.660 --> 13:57.560
And I'm doing a novel called Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.240
It's a magnificent book.

13:59.860 --> 14:06.220
And I'm turning that into a script which will have a celebrity cast and original music and sound effects and so on.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.120
My wife is also doing one for Cadman.

14:09.240 --> 14:16.640
She has just completed the sound and the pure, the William Faulkner on six sides of an LP.

14:17.780 --> 14:20.540
Hercules and Task because it's a beast of a book to write.

14:21.140 --> 14:22.720
The chronology is so strange.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.640
She's also done breakfast at Tiffany's.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.380
And so we've been pretty involved in that kind of thing.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.620
But I'm not a bandit in science fiction by any means.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.260
Well, you're still doing book reviews, aren't you?

14:35.400 --> 14:35.700
Oh, yeah.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.120
Yeah, that's neat.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.780
It fills my house up with books that I don't have to pay for.

14:41.620 --> 14:42.760
Is that why you do them?

14:43.300 --> 14:44.300
That's one of the reasons.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.580
But that's not the real reason.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.740
I'm always interested in the trends of people thinking.

14:50.380 --> 14:53.300
And when you do book reviews, you find things about these motivations.

14:54.580 --> 15:02.360
Certain things settle like a network over all sorts of writers, establish ones and new ones, like a huge net.

15:03.460 --> 15:10.100
For example, all of a sudden everybody's going to be writing stories about other worlds or other situations or other planets.

15:10.100 --> 15:20.200
And then the next thing you know, there'll be a whole spontaneous outpouring of books that have to do with, well, in both literature and in the movies.

15:20.440 --> 15:23.380
It's been the possessed child, for example.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.580
And you see these trends coming through.

15:27.720 --> 15:27.980
It's fascinating.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.240
You don't know where they come from.

15:30.680 --> 15:36.420
But all of a sudden everybody starts writing, or many, many people start writing a certain kind of fiction.

15:37.260 --> 15:40.580
And they're not imitating each other.

15:41.140 --> 15:45.660
There's a friend of mine who is a journalist in North Carolina.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.340
And he sent me two stories asking what I thought of them.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.400
And maybe I could help him place them.

15:52.100 --> 15:57.000
And one of them was Tron, which was a Disney movie.

15:57.780 --> 16:02.660
One very liked it, except that it was done in pinball machines instead of electronic games.

16:03.340 --> 16:12.720
And the other one was F. Paul Wilson's The Keep, which had to do with the buried vampire during World War II.

16:12.860 --> 16:15.980
And a lot of friction between an SS man and a regular German officer.

16:17.080 --> 16:25.680
And these two stories were written, you know, with absolutely no notion that they were being done elsewhere by other writers.

16:27.400 --> 16:31.960
It's an interesting phenomenon, but a book reviewer has a good look at that particular thing.

16:33.740 --> 16:40.500
You said you have no idea why certain trends or things like that start, say the popularity of fantasy or horror today.

16:41.940 --> 16:45.880
Well, part of it, as far as Hollywood is concerned, of course, that's purely imitative.

16:46.800 --> 16:52.600
I mean, somebody comes along with the exorcist, and immediately you could, I saw part of one just last night.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.820
Although I generally have vanished television from my life altogether.

16:56.740 --> 17:00.680
Jane and I decided we would not go look at television anymore, period.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.220
And for that we got what I can call an eight day week.

17:04.580 --> 17:07.940
You have no idea how much extra time you've got if you never look at the tube.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.120
You miss one or two really good things.

17:11.540 --> 17:16.000
But my roommate here upstairs has a television going almost all the time.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.200
And as I passed back and forth, I get a glimpse of this dream.

17:19.200 --> 17:27.000
There was so a part of one last night that had to do with a possessed child and a priest coming to perform an exorcism and so on.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.300
These things are purely imitative.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.760
Then when you get some deep space stories that begin to look terribly similar to one another,

17:36.520 --> 17:39.840
the air is full of Star Wars imitations of one sort or another.

17:40.600 --> 17:46.920
I mean, there's Star Wars and then on television there's Galactica, which is about as derivative as you can get.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.480
And so on.

17:49.640 --> 17:58.700
Hollywood feels that if anything is successful, you immediately jump on the bandwagon and make as many more as the traffic will bear along the same general theme.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.880
But soon or later they lose money on it and go on to something else.

18:03.920 --> 18:11.000
But the truly original idea is a very great deal of difficulty in getting in through the television and the movies.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.880
And with a little less trouble into the mainstream.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.320
That's not like what's popular today, they'll tell you, you know.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.480
Did you ever hear of a book called A Wrinkle in Time?

18:25.260 --> 18:25.480
Yeah.

18:26.120 --> 18:33.660
Well, Madeleine Lingle wrote that after having published one book as a young girl, which turned her from a writer into an author.

18:34.880 --> 18:39.960
And then she wrote Wrinkle not because of science fiction or anything else, but just the stories you wanted to write.

18:39.960 --> 18:50.140
And it was turned down 22 times. 22 publishers turned that down to the point where she and her husband, he was an actor and things were bad in the acting business.

18:50.820 --> 18:54.140
They trade together what many of them had and open a crossroads store in Connecticut.

18:54.960 --> 19:01.300
And about nine years later, somebody suggested that she submit Wrinkle again, then she became practically hysterical.

19:01.860 --> 19:03.380
But the second time out it hit.

19:03.380 --> 19:09.020
And as you know, it's a prize winning novel now with, it was just really up there in the Hall of Fame.

19:09.820 --> 19:10.540
A great book.

19:11.460 --> 19:14.480
But it wasn't like anything that was in the trend in those days.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.740
Nobody could understand it.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.100
Nobody would believe anybody would want to read it.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.500
And it's a delightful, powerful book.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.820
So it just goes with it.

19:26.820 --> 19:31.640
You have to kind of run at the speed where the train is running before you can climb aboard.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.700
To be totally original or to be running in the opposite direction.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.260
Sometimes you can grab on, but not always.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.680
Okay, back to yourself for just a few seconds here.

19:44.220 --> 19:48.140
You're not the type of writer who plans out a book or a story well ahead of time, are you?

19:49.720 --> 19:51.660
No, although I have done it that way.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.840
Usually it's a little image that's to catch fire.

19:57.980 --> 20:06.400
Like I mentioned with more than human, it came to, with the image of the old monk taking care of these starving children in the cave in the woods.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.340
He wasn't a main character in that book.

20:11.340 --> 20:17.760
And so the ones in my book weren't exactly that kind of thing either.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.040
But it was just the image that took off from that.

20:22.620 --> 20:31.080
And I suppose as you write all these other ideas cluster up more, Venus plus X was a way of getting off my chest.

20:31.180 --> 20:36.420
A whole lot of feelings that I had about our civilization as a whole and the things that were pushing it around.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.340
Particularly this business is sex differentiation.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.000
I wanted to see what it would be like if we didn't have that in a culture.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.580
And so I structured the whole novel around that.

20:48.540 --> 20:53.020
But you'll see that the book is built with alternate storylines.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.780
One is very contemporary.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.800
The other one is in this strange country of the Ladone.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.920
And they're double-stacks.

21:06.180 --> 21:07.840
But it comes always.

21:08.120 --> 21:12.040
Sometimes I do structure them, but mostly it comes from a flash of that short.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.560
Also, it's very difficult for me to write at all.

21:16.780 --> 21:23.920
Writing comes very hard to me indeed, including writing letters, which accounts for the size of my phone bill.

21:26.740 --> 21:31.900
However, when one of those things hit me, I would write for 30 hours at a time and just fall over sideways.

21:32.540 --> 21:34.460
Go off somewhere and convalesce.

21:35.840 --> 21:44.440
And so I don't rewrite almost everything I've ever written just exactly the way it came out of the typewriter the first time.

21:45.540 --> 21:55.120
So how the infrastructure appears and the spacing of smaller crises and all tying together into a large one at the end and so on.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.920
I don't know where that comes from.

21:57.260 --> 21:57.920
That just happens.

21:59.540 --> 22:01.740
I consider myself very fortunate in that.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.840
I would be a lot better off if I wrote more, but I don't.

22:06.740 --> 22:11.960
My bibliography looks a lot longer than it really is because I've been reprinted so much, and I'm very lucky there.

22:14.900 --> 22:20.720
Yeah, in that respect, the things that you've written, this is probably not a fair question to ask an author.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.360
A lot of them really don't want to answer it.

22:22.360 --> 22:28.420
But do you have any particular works of your own that you think are particularly good that you're proud of?

22:29.600 --> 22:30.920
Certain stories, yeah.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.180
The Silken Swift is a unicorn story, for example.

22:35.960 --> 22:37.080
I'm very proud of it.

22:37.340 --> 22:38.220
I love that story.

22:38.960 --> 22:45.920
And I've just written a new story which will appear, or is appearing right now in Germany.

22:45.920 --> 22:52.200
The deal there is that they get an original story and they hang on to it until six months after publication.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.460
And then I'm free to sell it anywhere else and you'll probably read it.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.880
And it seems to be a very simple story indeed.

22:58.040 --> 22:58.880
It's called Seasoning.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.800
It's about a guy who has a kind of a metaphysical experience.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.140
And it's not anywhere near as simple a story as it seems to be.

23:08.580 --> 23:09.860
But I'm very proud of that one.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.020
You'll see it in due course.

23:15.940 --> 23:22.380
But see, looking for others of what I would call my favorite story, I do like that unicorn story.

23:22.520 --> 23:23.360
I like the way it's written.

23:23.960 --> 23:28.640
It's a very passionate story and it has something I consider very important to say.

23:32.680 --> 23:40.600
There again I'd be combating the assumption that a woman who is not a virgin is not as good a woman as she might be.

23:43.480 --> 23:44.760
Yeah, I remember that story.

23:45.900 --> 23:47.960
That was the basic statement of the story.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.600
It's wonderful that it came out in case that way because I love the way that story is written.

23:55.620 --> 23:56.340
Okay, listen.

23:57.460 --> 24:00.760
Oh, then of course there's The Dreaming Jewels, which was great fun to write.

24:01.600 --> 24:09.060
And another novel I wrote called Cosmic Rates.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.660
But you don't see around very much anymore.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.200
It'll be reissued sometime soon.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
What I like about that story is that it has in it, I don't know, 18 or 20 different story lines.

24:20.620 --> 24:24.120
And the way they're all pulled together at the end absolutely amazes me.

24:24.240 --> 24:29.840
It really genuinely amazes me how I could get that many completely disparate story ideas

24:29.840 --> 24:32.340
and pull them all together into the same place.

24:34.020 --> 24:37.140
I read that thing and said, gosh, how did he do that?

24:37.140 --> 24:40.040
And then I realized that he who did it was me.

24:42.420 --> 24:44.320
Wasn't The Dreaming Jewels your first novel?

24:44.600 --> 24:45.920
Yeah, and it was a great deal.

24:46.040 --> 24:50.360
I did not know about writing novels at that time, so it is flawed as a novel.

24:51.020 --> 24:53.240
But it has some good writing in it.

24:57.300 --> 24:58.080
Yeah, okay.

25:00.120 --> 25:06.100
I've often heard this quoted and I wondered what the input is, sort of the occasion for it was.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.860
And that is Sturgeon's Law.

25:08.600 --> 25:12.880
Oh, that came about sometime in the 50s.

25:12.880 --> 25:16.780
And I can't remember exactly where it was, but it was at a science fiction convention.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.700
And there was somebody who came to, you know, some people like to make an impact

25:23.700 --> 25:27.460
by getting a whole bunch of people who like a particular thing

25:27.460 --> 25:29.520
and coming up and tearing it all to pieces.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.700
And he'd done his homework.

25:31.980 --> 25:36.700
He got a copy of every magazine that was in the hotel newsstand and every book.

25:37.260 --> 25:40.100
And he spent all night leafing through them.

25:40.660 --> 25:46.260
And he had a whole forearm full of book and magazines with bookmarks in them.

25:46.580 --> 25:52.780
And he convulsed the audience there for about 40 minutes with examples of some of the worst syntax,

25:53.420 --> 25:58.120
some of the dumbest dialogues, some of the most improbable science and so on.

25:59.060 --> 26:02.380
Which in those days, the science fiction was a whole lot of it.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.680
And then he said to me right on stage,

26:04.860 --> 26:08.680
well you're not conceived that this science fiction is 90% crap.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.040
And I answered, I had this rush of brains with the head.

26:13.500 --> 26:18.200
I answered him by saying, yes, that's only because 90% of everything is crap.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.760
Which quite took the wind out of his self.

26:21.920 --> 26:25.640
Then I was able to go on and develop the idea, which is only true,

26:25.640 --> 26:31.080
that science fiction has been in the ghetto for so long that people say,

26:31.120 --> 26:34.840
oh this is like Kingsley Amies said, this is science fiction, it can't be good.

26:35.520 --> 26:43.220
And it was unique as a literary genre in that it was not permitted its spectrum of poor and good.

26:43.640 --> 26:49.220
That is to say in the mystery field everybody could distinguish between the same Mickey Spelane

26:49.220 --> 26:52.260
and somebody like Nioh Marsh or Darcy L. Sayers.

26:52.260 --> 26:56.140
There's a spectrum of excellence there, so these things are better than others.

26:56.700 --> 27:01.360
Same thing in the westerns, Hopalong Cassidy is not the same thing as Best Rewrits again.

27:02.440 --> 27:10.160
But science fiction, it was all buck rogers, zap guns, and space in the year 2200.

27:11.440 --> 27:16.120
And nobody would have twice on the fact to find that there was good science fiction and bad science fiction.

27:16.660 --> 27:18.120
And excellent and poor writing.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.120
And that caused my response.

27:22.340 --> 27:27.960
But since then that's been caused by surgeons' law that 90% of this is bad because 90% of everything is bad.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.280
The president company accepted of course.

27:31.800 --> 27:32.280
Okay.

27:35.820 --> 27:39.560
How do you retain your optimism? Why hasn't the world beaten you down?

27:41.360 --> 27:45.140
Well I've had my depressive periods, but usually they've been personal

27:45.140 --> 27:48.420
and not species if you see what I mean.

27:49.640 --> 27:54.860
I share the awe of humanity that Shakespeare did when he wrote that beautiful passage.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.340
What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.600
You remember that? How God-like in his aspect.

28:03.820 --> 28:06.140
And I've always had that feeling about humanity.

28:06.420 --> 28:09.020
It's an extraordinary development in the universe.

28:09.780 --> 28:10.380
Extraordinary.

28:11.600 --> 28:16.000
And it's our potential really that excites and fuels me the most.

28:17.040 --> 28:23.480
I think that in being created we were given the ability to solve all our problems.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.600
That doesn't mean to say we were given the solutions to all our problems.

28:28.700 --> 28:29.440
I didn't say that.

28:30.840 --> 28:36.360
But if you have a little girl who was dying of leukemia at the age of five, that seems like a terrible injustice.

28:36.360 --> 28:39.580
But the ability to solve that problem is with us.

28:40.620 --> 28:43.200
Even the fact that her death can contribute to it.

28:45.060 --> 28:50.800
We're the one species that is given this ability all the way through to solve our own problems.

28:51.960 --> 28:56.360
And if we don't take advantage of that ability of course, we're doomed.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.540
But the point is that we do have that ability.

28:58.860 --> 29:01.680
I marvel at that. Absolutely marvel at that.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.360
So this is really the basis of my love for humanity as a whole.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.660
Do you have any plans for any future science fiction?

29:12.140 --> 29:13.500
Oh yeah. Yeah.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.040
I've got a number of things going.

29:16.360 --> 29:19.080
I have an outlining book called Star Anguish.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.680
Which has to do with the...

29:24.180 --> 29:26.940
I'm not quite sure of the framework that it will have.

29:26.940 --> 29:37.440
At first I was thinking of the kind of government and the development of a moral and ethical posture for a spaceship on a 20,000 year voyage.

29:38.440 --> 29:40.900
And the watch through generations developed.

29:41.620 --> 29:47.960
And the kind of religions and morality and so on that would come and go during that kind of history.

29:50.220 --> 29:53.360
But I'm beginning to have two thoughts about that.

29:53.360 --> 29:58.040
But I think I'll take that name, Spame, and use it in some other framework.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.240
But I know it's tight. Let's go start anguish.

30:04.300 --> 30:08.120
Okay, good. Listen, this is taking a lot of your time Mr. Surgeon.

30:08.180 --> 30:09.680
Maybe we better stop right about here.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.160
Yeah, I've got to get back to the script.

30:12.340 --> 30:13.740
I'm going to work all tonight and all tomorrow.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.340
Listen, maybe I'll get to meet you this summer.

30:16.500 --> 30:21.100
I've applied for the James Gunn Institute in Kansas this summer.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.080
I sure hope that makes. Do you have any idea if it will?

30:23.420 --> 30:27.240
I certainly hope so, Carol. And as far as I know, it is going forward.

30:28.740 --> 30:32.680
I'm going to Wichita on Thursday and we'll probably learn more about it then.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.860
Okay, yeah, I certainly hope it does work.

30:36.300 --> 30:42.460
Well, listen Mr. Surgeon, what we'll do is to edit these tapes and I'm sure we'll get a couple of weeks worth of shows out of them.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.860
Because each show is only about five minutes.

30:45.140 --> 30:48.580
And so we'll probably get at least two weeks of shows out of this.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.840
So we will send you the tapes when it's edited.

30:51.240 --> 30:56.560
Right, that's fine. And if you want to wait until you have them all and spend a seven to five minute segment.

30:56.900 --> 30:57.960
Yeah, oh yeah, we'll do that.

30:58.120 --> 31:02.780
In fact, if they will probably, I'll probably just bring them to you this summer unless we mail them earlier.

31:03.220 --> 31:04.820
If I see you there at Lawrence.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.620
That'll be great. And you do have my mailing address here.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.620
Yeah, let's see. This is the San Diego address.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.040
Yeah, three, five, or five out of this to drive.

31:14.200 --> 31:14.700
That's the one.

31:15.260 --> 31:17.580
Mr. Surgeon, we sure appreciate the time you've given us.

31:17.580 --> 31:24.520
Well, it's been a pleasure to talk to you and I like things like this because, you know, nobody knows what he believes until he tells somebody else.

31:24.800 --> 31:29.900
Yeah, no, I've been very impressed with your work and it's an honor to talk to you and I hope to meet you soon.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.860
Well, I'm looking forward to it too, Carol.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.360
Okay, then take care, Mr. Surgeon.

31:33.700 --> 31:33.840
Bye.
