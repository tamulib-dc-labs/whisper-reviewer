WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:02.860
I'm like I reiterated things.

00:03.100 --> 00:05.040
Tell him anything about it.

00:05.860 --> 00:07.520
Transition to Scott Baum.

00:11.340 --> 00:16.460
We also had the opportunity to talk to another acquaintance of Robert E. Howard, Mr. Scott Baum.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.640
Nothing about Adam, his brother?

00:25.980 --> 00:28.260
Let me get things cranked up here.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.280
What are you going to ask me?

00:31.360 --> 00:32.760
That makes no difference.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.820
How long have you been living in Cross Plains?

00:42.340 --> 00:46.480
I've been living in Cross Plains since 1922.

00:49.820 --> 00:51.000
That's a while, isn't it?

00:52.940 --> 00:54.820
I was a boy here.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.160
I went to college and came back.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.260
Took over the newspaper.

00:59.540 --> 01:01.340
I got out of college one day and took over the newspaper.

01:01.500 --> 01:07.620
I retired from the newspaper about eight or nine years ago.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.040
When did you first meet Mr. Howard?

01:11.240 --> 01:12.800
When did I first meet him?

01:12.920 --> 01:14.880
Well, as a boy, I knew him here.

01:16.260 --> 01:21.480
When he was a boy, Howard would be about four or five years old or nine.

01:21.820 --> 01:22.980
Four years, I guess.

01:23.140 --> 01:26.340
I guess he'd be about 70 years old.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.960
Howard would be about 74 or five now, I think.

01:31.980 --> 01:36.260
I could check that out for you, but possibly you got that information at hand.

01:38.020 --> 01:39.720
When did you...

01:39.720 --> 01:42.280
I knew him at...

01:43.280 --> 01:45.480
I started to high school.

01:45.680 --> 01:53.840
I came in here, moved here from a nearby town and entered high school as about a sophomore.

01:55.380 --> 01:59.860
In those days, we only had ten grades here and they were not affiliated.

02:00.880 --> 02:04.380
Howard went down to Brownwood to finish his high school work

02:04.380 --> 02:07.480
in order to be qualified to enter college.

02:10.900 --> 02:17.480
When you came back to Cross Plains after going to college and you started over the newspaper...

02:18.040 --> 02:22.080
That was in July. I took over the newspaper in July 1930.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.460
Howard was here at the time.

02:25.520 --> 02:30.620
He was a young man, I was twenty years old and Howard must have been 24 or five.

02:32.040 --> 02:37.480
He was writing for a bunch of pulp magazines, just getting started.

02:39.700 --> 02:44.660
Very few people remember the names of those magazines, but it was Stone Street and Smith.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.380
They published a number of magazines like Weird Tales.

02:50.920 --> 02:58.840
Weird Tales was one of them, I believe, and Boxing and Wild West and a whole lot of stuff like that.

02:58.840 --> 03:04.220
He mainly wrote for Weird Tales, but he also occasionally wrote for...

03:04.220 --> 03:08.540
He's a ring or something. He occasionally wrote for Boxing magazine too.

03:08.900 --> 03:18.120
Yeah, we were talking to Ms. Laughlin. She said sometimes he would go down the streets there, shadow boxing and sort of doing little...

03:18.120 --> 03:25.300
Yeah, I imagine that's more or less exaggerated. Howard was a little on the odd side.

03:25.300 --> 03:28.320
He wasn't an animal. There were very many people. He was rather a loof.

03:28.960 --> 03:36.120
But he was a big robust man. To me, he was a combination of Edgar Allen Poe and Jack London.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.220
If you can imagine that two together.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.700
Yeah, he had those books in his library, so I can imagine that pretty well.

03:42.720 --> 03:47.100
Well, he was very robust like Jack London.

03:47.100 --> 03:54.100
He was a majestist like Poe.

03:54.860 --> 04:00.260
And once he wrote a few poems, maybe you're familiar with one called The Temptress.

04:00.940 --> 04:08.460
The Temptress. He wrote a very good... It reminds you of Poe's Raven, something, the meter of it, something like that.

04:08.960 --> 04:17.680
In that he compares that The Temptress is a beautiful maiden who lures him. Her name is Suicide.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.540
Yeah, I do believe I have read that one.

04:20.660 --> 04:21.720
Yeah, I'm sure you've read it.

04:21.840 --> 04:26.900
Yeah. Were there any people in Cross Plains aware that Howard was a writer?

04:27.780 --> 04:32.020
No, they all knew it. I published in the newspaper, you know, once in a while.

04:32.020 --> 04:40.500
I'd say Robert Howard had a story this week and Weird Tales or some of those pop magazines. Yeah, they knew it.

04:40.540 --> 04:44.540
Yeah, yeah, I take it being a small town, I guess, just about everybody knew everything else.

04:44.700 --> 04:45.460
Oh, yeah, that's right.

04:46.340 --> 04:52.060
And his daddy was a doctor here, a country doctor, a general practitioner, well thought of, very popular.

04:54.920 --> 04:59.560
And his father was proud of the fact that his son was a gifted writer.

05:01.220 --> 05:02.720
He talked about it.

05:07.780 --> 05:12.000
Yeah. Well, let's see. I'm about to run through my gambit of questions here.

05:12.040 --> 05:18.340
Is there anything, any particular stories you know about Mr. Howard being that you were a newspaper man and everything?

05:18.560 --> 05:21.580
He might have had some exploits out there.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.960
I remember the morning he killed himself very well.

05:29.040 --> 05:37.840
It was, I can't think of this one it was. I know it was a warm season of the year, it must have been summer.

05:39.000 --> 05:47.520
But anyway, early in the summer, 10, 11 o'clock in the morning, I heard on the street that Robert Howard had just shot himself.

05:47.520 --> 05:54.900
And I immediately jumped in my car and ran down there and got down there and a few neighbors had gathered.

05:55.780 --> 06:04.920
It wasn't generally known over town, but the old justice of the peace was standing there on the, on the gallery, the front porch.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.760
And when I walked up, he called and said, come here Jack.

06:08.120 --> 06:15.000
And I stepped up there and he took me into the bedroom and he pointed to an old Underwood typewriter.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.420
He had the four lines written on it there.

06:18.500 --> 06:26.000
And Howard had, when he had been told that his mother wouldn't, wouldn't live throughout the day,

06:27.020 --> 06:32.400
he went to this top right, wrote these four lines, walked outside, sat down his car and shot his head off.

06:33.140 --> 06:36.260
And this old J.P. asked me what these four lines meant.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.580
They said, I'm sure you've read them all, flat all done.

06:40.580 --> 06:44.500
So let me own the tire. The feast is over. The lamps expire.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.480
Yeah, we had read that.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.800
I'm sure you've read that.

06:50.280 --> 06:58.020
To me, I've been told since then by Sprayk the Kemp that the lines are not entirely original,

06:58.460 --> 07:03.440
but they were certainly original as far as I'd ever heard or anybody else I've ever talked to except Sprayk the Kemp.

07:04.660 --> 07:10.020
Yeah, I imagine that was Howard's way of putting it.

07:10.020 --> 07:14.520
Yeah, that was his mother, the crazy. His finale.

07:17.240 --> 07:21.660
Well, Mr. Scott, I can't think of anything else. Can you think of any other bold thing?

07:21.660 --> 07:25.540
I'll tell you, you've got a son of Aaron Odessa. I'll tell you, a young man there, an Odessa,

07:25.680 --> 07:27.720
you can pick up on the telephone and call him and knew him.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.220
I'm Howard.

07:48.580 --> 07:49.960
Have you talked to CS4?

07:51.200 --> 07:53.380
No, sir. We talked to Jack Scott.

07:53.880 --> 07:54.880
Yeah, I know Jack.

07:55.380 --> 07:58.820
They're in cross planes and he referred us to you and your brother.

08:01.220 --> 08:10.760
And what we're mainly just looking for are just some, oh, some interesting stories or any reminiscences you might have about Mr. Howard.

08:12.180 --> 08:15.580
Well, yes, I'd be glad to tell you what I know about him.

08:15.840 --> 08:19.660
I kind of think of some of the things that happened.

08:19.960 --> 08:25.760
He was an unusual fella. I know that.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.920
And have you read some of his stories?

08:29.480 --> 08:30.980
Yes, I have. What type of person was he?

08:31.700 --> 08:33.420
Well, he was kind of a loner.

08:37.660 --> 08:42.320
And I'll just recount one instance. I don't think he ever went with a girl at all.

08:43.420 --> 08:48.540
But he wrote some pretty outstanding stories.

08:53.720 --> 09:01.680
Well, as I say in the, I recall some of the stories he wrote when he was in high school.

09:02.520 --> 09:07.420
And they were really outstanding, but he never did.

09:08.960 --> 09:15.240
He really wasn't in our group. He was kind of an outsider yet. He was readily accepted.

09:15.240 --> 09:24.640
But I remember one time we were having a party and I was running in the little rental store there in the cross planes.

09:25.040 --> 09:35.800
And we were having a party upstairs and Robert came and we were drinking some beer, some choc beer or something.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.860
And I was way back before prohibition, you know.

09:41.900 --> 09:47.000
And I know he got very upset about it. He got a little bit tired.

09:48.260 --> 09:53.740
And he said that he'd kill anybody that interfered with his hands.

09:54.180 --> 09:59.780
If his hands ever got damaged by somebody else, then he'd kill them.

10:03.380 --> 10:03.780
Hello?

10:04.160 --> 10:04.720
Yes, sir.

10:06.060 --> 10:09.300
And that was just kind of the kind of fellow he was, kind of morose.

10:11.980 --> 10:16.420
And he thought he had a real bright future in the head of him. He's a writer.

10:19.800 --> 10:25.060
And I don't think I ever saw him after that until I heard he had committed suicide, didn't he?

10:25.320 --> 10:28.660
Yes, sir, he did. He did. In 1936.

10:28.660 --> 10:34.720
I knew his father real well. I didn't know his mother much. I know he was an only child, I believe.

10:39.340 --> 10:46.820
And he never did enter into any of our activities as much as I remember.

10:47.540 --> 10:51.580
So I don't really know what I could say to you that would help you.

10:52.980 --> 10:56.960
Well, what you've already told us is quite a bit of help. Why do you suppose he was such a loner?

10:57.140 --> 11:01.520
Being in friends from such a small town and usually everybody, you know, does things so much together?

11:01.760 --> 11:07.680
I don't know. I don't know. He just, he could have been a great author, I think.

11:09.040 --> 11:15.120
He had a, I don't remember even what kind of grades he made academically.

11:16.600 --> 11:25.260
I know I took an ID he had for a story and tried to write a theme on it.

11:25.440 --> 11:32.580
And he had already turned it to me. And I got in big trouble there, you know, trying to steal his ID.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.520
And that kind of, I never did try that anymore again.

11:38.520 --> 11:48.640
But I know he could tell a story that might really, this was something about a bear who got up in the attic or something

11:48.640 --> 11:52.760
and broke through and disturbed some poker players.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.860
But then I really can't tell you very much about Robert.

11:58.540 --> 12:04.340
I'm thinking of it. There's another writer, C.S. Boyles. I don't know if you ever heard of him or not.

12:06.220 --> 12:06.820
No, sir?

12:07.140 --> 12:09.640
Out of town. Jack's cop didn't mention C.S.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.400
No, I don't believe so, no.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.220
What Jack tells you about him?

12:17.640 --> 12:30.620
Mostly he had worked a little bit for Jack on the newspaper and Jack talked about what type of person he was, or the vigorous man, although he kept to himself quite a bit.

12:31.720 --> 12:45.840
I wish I could recall more about that party, but I know he scared the hell out of all of us, because he got really excited and always trying to damage his writing career or something, getting him full of beer.

12:47.320 --> 12:59.540
I don't recall exactly what, but anyway, he said he'd kill anybody that damaged his hands in any way.

12:59.540 --> 13:11.300
I seem like I remember that pretty vividly. I don't know, maybe something happened there with his hands. Maybe we got him wracking a match or something. I don't know.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.940
But anyway, he wanted to write with his hands.

13:20.860 --> 13:27.800
That's very interesting. You don't happen to write like any other things that you might have done with Howard back when we were living in Crossroads.

13:27.800 --> 13:39.300
Well, like I say, he wasn't in our group. We went fishing and we went swimming in the bow there and we hunted quail, but he was never one of us.

13:40.300 --> 13:46.340
And how he happened to be in this deal, I don't know, I don't think he ever had the date with a girl.

13:47.340 --> 13:54.360
He was a nice looking guy, very presentable and tall and well made.

13:56.880 --> 14:09.520
And even if I talk to you, I can't really tell you anything much that I remember about him, except that I remember him being a very outstanding, that he would have been a great writer, I think.

14:10.560 --> 14:20.720
Listen, what you've told me so far has been quite helpful. We're putting together bits and pieces of people who did know him, along with some research that some other people have done.

14:24.560 --> 14:30.360
And I'd like to go ahead and put your recollections of that party and some of the other things you said into our program.

14:32.800 --> 14:43.320
Well, that's authentic, but I can't quite recall the details of what happened to his hands. Maybe we were arm wrestling or something, I don't know.

14:43.880 --> 14:53.960
But he got very uptight about what might happen to one of his hands or his arms or something.

14:56.240 --> 14:59.560
I guess that was the only time he ever had a drink of beer in his life.

15:00.580 --> 15:05.760
It sounded like what I was talking to some other people, that he might have been insecure.

15:07.000 --> 15:15.280
Well, I think so. He was an only child, I don't know how close he was with his mother, but I don't think his father had anything to do with him.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.660
It was my kind of feeling, I don't know.

15:23.120 --> 15:36.720
Dr. Harrod was a real fine man, though, and I don't know how close they were together, but I think that he worshipped his mother. It was my impression in those years.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.840
I don't know whether she died first or not, do you?

15:42.800 --> 15:48.400
She had gone into a coma and was not expected to recover.

15:48.880 --> 16:01.100
Oh, well now that's the reason for this suicide. Because he worshipped her. I know I can almost be sure of that, that he worshipped his mother.

16:04.580 --> 16:09.120
And I know that her condition affects him very much.

16:11.840 --> 16:17.880
And I know that he was afraid that something would happen that he couldn't write anymore.

16:20.420 --> 16:26.200
Whether it was in his mind or in his fear that something would happen to his hands.

16:27.800 --> 16:32.260
But that's the instance that I recall more vividly than anything else, and I've often thought of it.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.020
I certainly do appreciate your talking with me.

16:36.020 --> 16:43.800
And I believe that he could have strangled me to death there.

16:44.540 --> 16:52.040
I don't recall whether it was me or somebody else, but it seems to me like his anger was supporting me.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.880
But I know he's frightened the hell out of me.

16:58.580 --> 17:01.700
He was a very big and strong fellow.

17:01.700 --> 17:05.620
Yes, very strong. Could have twisted your neck off.

17:07.340 --> 17:09.200
Much like the heroes that he wrote about.

17:14.840 --> 17:21.380
If you give me your address, I'll send you a release form. What that does is simply you give us permission to use what I've been taping.

17:21.380 --> 17:26.020
Oh, well, that doesn't matter to me. I don't care whether you use it or not. I'm just trying to be honest with you.

17:26.840 --> 17:31.900
I have no hold on it. You can quote me any way you want to.

17:32.740 --> 17:37.940
As I say, it's been a long time ago, but those are my recollections and I've often thought of it.

17:39.360 --> 17:44.980
I've made a real strong impression on these that I was in real danger there.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.760
Fortunately, you made it through it.

17:49.940 --> 17:55.800
Other things have happened to me that I guess are almost dangerous, but anyway, that's it.

17:56.740 --> 17:58.680
That's what I remember about Robert.

18:00.340 --> 18:05.380
Truth all at with no problems, apparently.

18:06.540 --> 18:12.800
And no attachments that I know of to anybody except...
