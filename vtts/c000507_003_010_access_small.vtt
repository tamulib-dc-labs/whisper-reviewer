00:08.800 --> 00:12.680
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.320 --> 00:33.640
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.940
And here are your hosts.

00:42.220 --> 00:43.340
This is Daryl Lane.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.060
And Bill Vernon.

00:44.700 --> 00:48.160
Science Fiction in school, a combination that's becoming more important all the time.

00:48.380 --> 00:51.660
Teachers all over the country are finding out that science fiction in the classroom is

00:51.660 --> 00:55.340
a natural at all levels, junior high, high school, and college.

00:55.740 --> 00:57.440
And there's some pretty clear reasons for that too.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.440
Some of the most significant literature of our time is science fiction.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.020
It's relevant, it's vital, and it teaches people how to cope with future shock while entertaining them.

01:05.260 --> 01:09.620
One of the strongest college science fiction programs can be found at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.520
English faculty member James Gunn, assisted by colleague Stephen Goldman, runs the program.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.980
Gunn is a science fiction author of long-standing.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.080
His novels include The Immortals, The Listeners, The Joymakers, and The Dreamers.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.920
We ask Gunn about science fiction at the University of Kansas.

01:23.920 --> 01:35.440
Because of our interest here, I think I've attracted some graduate students who are interested in the area, some of whom have gotten degrees, not in science fiction because we don't offer one.

01:36.420 --> 01:50.460
But in science fiction-related areas, I have one graduate student now who's doing his dissertation on my work, and another one who graduated last year,

01:50.460 --> 01:57.940
who did a creative dissertation of a book of science fiction stories.

01:59.640 --> 02:15.140
So we have had that body of graduate students who have taught science fiction classes at the sophomore level as one of the required courses in composition and literature.

02:15.140 --> 02:31.700
And I also traditionally teach a science fiction course, an undergraduate and graduate science fiction course each year, although my primary duties in the English department are the teaching of fiction writing.

02:32.540 --> 02:36.260
Every summer, Gunn is responsible for a unique offering at the University of Kansas.

02:37.260 --> 02:52.760
Perhaps our most interesting science fiction offering, however, is the three-week intensive English Institute on the teaching of science fiction that we offer in the summer.

02:55.360 --> 03:08.000
We realized a number of years ago that there were a lot of people faced with the task, sometimes self-assumed, sometimes assigned, of teaching a science fiction course.

03:10.320 --> 03:20.840
And they were largely unprepared because there had been no academic program on science fiction, certainly not on the teaching of science fiction.

03:20.840 --> 03:45.600
So we set up this intensive three-week workshop to offer teachers the opportunity to attend and get a six-credited hour program in science fiction, in all aspects of science fiction, in just three weeks.

03:45.600 --> 04:04.580
And it's a very intensive experience. We bring in several science fiction writers besides myself. This year we're having Gordon Dixon and Theodore Sturgeon, Frederick Cole, and it has been a most successful and satisfying experience.

04:20.800 --> 04:26.860
The dates of the intensive English Institute on the teaching of science fiction are July 11th to July 29th.

04:26.860 --> 04:35.280
The Institute offers a fascinating opportunity for teachers of science fiction on any level to spend three weeks living and studying science fiction with people who write it and people who teach it.

04:35.280 --> 04:46.240
And there will be two important events held in conjunction with the Teaching Institute, the annual meeting of the Science Fiction Research Association, and the Campbell Award Conference, which will honor the best science fiction novel of the year.

04:46.700 --> 04:53.020
Contact James Gunn at the University of Kansas right away for more information on the intensive English Institute on the Teaching of Science Fiction.

04:59.920 --> 05:08.540
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.040
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:07.740 --> 06:17.340
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy. And here are your hosts.

06:21.520 --> 06:31.660
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane, one of the most popular and unique fantasy authors ever was J.R.R. Tolkien, whose trilogy about Hobbits, The Lord of the Rings, came out of the 1950s.

06:31.780 --> 06:41.420
Tolkien has become a phenomenon. His books have gone through countless printings. There are Tolkien societies and clubs all over the world, and his Middle Earth has for many readers become a place as real as our own world.

06:41.420 --> 06:49.460
There have been four or five Tolkien organizations in this country and others scattered all over the world, with most successful as the British Tolkien Society.

06:49.960 --> 06:58.560
The Science Fiction Radio Show spoke with Lester Simons, the membership secretary of the Tolkien Society, when he came to this country for a Tolkien moot at the World Science Fiction Convention in Denver.

06:59.020 --> 07:01.420
We asked him to tell us about the Tolkien Society.

07:02.120 --> 07:20.720
The Society was founded in England in 1969 with a very small group of members. The Society has grown gradually over the years, various notices in various books, directory listings and so on.

07:20.720 --> 07:35.760
We now have 1,200 members, approximately, in 26 countries throughout the world. So although we're based in England, I think we have the largest worldwide spread.

07:36.980 --> 07:41.460
One way members of the Tolkien Society correspond among themselves is through the Society's publications.

07:42.460 --> 07:59.340
We have two regular publications. Amonhen is approximately bimonthly, is a bullet in and a newsletter, letters of comment from members, short articles, short poems, small artwork.

08:00.320 --> 08:06.320
It's really for immediate consumption, the ephemeral material.

08:07.660 --> 08:15.580
And the other publication is Malon, the journal, very much more academic. It comes out, we hope, twice a year.

08:16.800 --> 08:27.760
So sometimes we get a Malon and an Amonhen together. Malon is a larger format. It has longer poems, sometimes they run to three pages.

08:27.760 --> 08:40.680
Members own poems in the Tolkien manner. Some of them are imitations of Tolkien style, others are members' own work in their own styles.

08:41.400 --> 08:53.080
Essays, longer book reviews, articles of rather more specific interest, and it is very much less time dependent.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.440
We ask Simons if there were activities in fellowship among members.

08:58.240 --> 09:06.560
Oh yes, considerable. Our local groups are called Smiles. From the Hobbit, Smile is a comfortable Hobbit whole.

09:07.480 --> 09:12.660
And we hope that our members feel as comfortable in our Smiles as they would in a Hobbit home.

09:14.060 --> 09:22.960
We have Smiles in many countries. In some countries there just aren't enough members to get together because they're too widely separated.

09:24.000 --> 09:37.720
But in England there are Smiles all over the country. They run themselves as they wish. Some of them are very formal, some have costume, others don't.

09:37.720 --> 09:52.800
Some publish their own little newsletters with subsequent meeting venues, short reviews, as artwork. It just depends on what the members in any particular area wish to do.

09:53.760 --> 10:01.440
There are also two national meetings annually for the society. One is a formal business meeting, the other is the Oxenmoot, held on a weekend in late September.

10:02.380 --> 10:10.620
And it is a weekend where members who otherwise don't normally see other people come together, Smiles send representative groups.

10:10.980 --> 10:20.240
Other societies send representative groups. This year we should have groups from Stockholm, from... there will be a representative from America.

10:21.060 --> 10:30.620
There will be groups from all over the United Kingdom. And it is just a weekend of being in company of Tolkien people.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.060
More about the Tolkien Society on our next show.

10:41.100 --> 10:49.740
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.560
Next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:50.220 --> 11:55.500
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.760
And here are your hosts.

12:04.020 --> 12:09.440
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon. We're speaking with Lester Simons, membership secretary of the Tolkien Society.

12:09.680 --> 12:18.460
The Tolkien Society was founded in 1969 in England and is now a worldwide organization dedicated to the study and appreciation of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.560
We ask Simons if there were differences between American and British Tolkien fans.

12:22.560 --> 12:31.320
Most definitely. American fans are very much more exuberant in the way they go about things.

12:32.700 --> 12:36.100
Some people think we may be a little bit too staid and too formal.

12:39.860 --> 12:49.260
It sounds a little bit high-handed to say so, but it suits our purpose to be more literary and to keep our costume event down to one a year.

12:49.940 --> 12:57.240
If we did everything in costume, then it might lose some of its interest because that is not how we were set up.

12:57.840 --> 13:03.720
The Swedish societies, of which there are three major ones, do things in costume.

13:03.880 --> 13:09.720
They are specifically organized in a manner very similar, in fact, to the American SCA.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.160
They do society for creative anachronism.

13:14.520 --> 13:18.400
They do things in costume with weapons and they have guilds.

13:19.740 --> 13:23.360
But they don't publish quite so much as we do.

13:24.620 --> 13:29.940
There is room in Tolkien fandom for all sorts and it would be a poorer place without either of us.

13:31.080 --> 13:37.480
J.R.R. Tolkien's son and executor Christopher has been going through his father's papers and gathering material for publication.

13:37.880 --> 13:43.900
As a result of his efforts, three volumes have been published, the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales and the letters of J.R.R. Tolkien.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.000
We ask Simons if any more material might be forthcoming.

13:47.700 --> 13:56.000
Well, there is a great deal of linguistic material still to be published, whether it will be published as a book of linguistic matters,

13:56.460 --> 14:00.200
or whether they will end up as footnotes in other books, I don't know.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.920
There is a great deal of poetry.

14:04.180 --> 14:09.940
The Silmarillion had a remarkable lack of verse, which we are waiting to see.

14:11.520 --> 14:16.500
There may be other tales filling in some gaps in Middle Earth.

14:18.580 --> 14:27.400
But all we know is that there were papers sat in box files on a table eight feet long.

14:29.340 --> 14:35.020
There is a considerable amount of material. How much of it is publishable is not known.

14:36.320 --> 14:46.980
How much of it is readable is, again, a matter for debate because towards the end of his life, the professor's handwriting became not so much untidy as illegible.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.480
And even Christopher can't read it.

14:49.580 --> 14:53.240
Finally, we wondered if there was enough material to keep the Tolkien Society in existence.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.560
Wouldn't it run out of things to do after a while?

14:57.740 --> 15:03.700
Well, there are always new people coming in to the societies. People discover Middle Earth at all ages.

15:05.580 --> 15:10.280
And people will not be asking the same sort of questions, but they will be asking them in different ways.

15:10.900 --> 15:14.680
And as more and more material gets published, interpretations will vary.

15:15.840 --> 15:26.780
I think there will be sufficient interest. After all, Sherlock Holmes Society has been going for some time, and there's now no longer any possibility of more Sherlock Holmes stories.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.200
It doesn't seem to worry them at all.

15:30.600 --> 15:38.560
And with what we already have of Middle Earth, we can keep going for a considerable number of years.

15:38.560 --> 15:50.000
And of course, we mustn't forget that the professor did a lot of pure academic linguistic material, which is very difficult to find, but extremely worthwhile when you can find it.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.540
And that will keep us going for a very, very long time.

15:54.740 --> 16:01.900
Even readers who don't belong to the Tolkien Club would agree that Tolkien's work is one of the greatest achievements in the history of imaginative literature.

16:01.900 --> 16:11.680
And Tolkien's Middle Earth is such a fully realized world, and Tolkien went to such depth in providing background for it, that it does indeed seem unlikely fans could run out of things to study and share.

16:18.940 --> 16:27.440
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:12.120 --> 17:15.980
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:31.900 --> 17:36.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.260
And here are your hosts.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.500
This is Bill Vernon.

17:46.740 --> 17:47.320
And Daryl Lane.

17:47.580 --> 17:55.200
One of the most intricately plotted and provocative science fiction novels to come out in recent years is Dean Eng's 1981 book, Systemic Shock.

17:55.660 --> 17:59.660
It concerns a nuclear war, the Third World War, so to speak, that many people today fear.

17:59.660 --> 18:06.920
One of the differences between this treatment of nuclear war, though, and others on the same topic, is the incredible wealth of detail that Eng has provided.

18:07.340 --> 18:18.760
Systemic Shock is a classic example of extrapolation. Eng takes all the major countries on Earth, China, Russia, India, the United States, sets the story in 1996, and shows what could happen if nuclear war broke out.

18:19.100 --> 18:25.420
The novel is so complex in its structure that it obviously is a result of a mince effort, we're asking if it was difficult to write.

18:30.420 --> 18:35.720
You've asked a lot of questions that I have to answer yes to, so you must have really done your homework.

18:36.160 --> 18:45.460
Yeah, it took me years to get all the background for this, especially with Asian and the Indian subcontinent on Asia.

18:46.060 --> 18:56.280
All of the variables, the socio-geopolitical variables of that book were enough to drive me crazy.

18:57.440 --> 19:08.200
I talk for historians, and in the case of India, more than any other case, I think, whatever I suggested as a scenario for the future,

19:09.120 --> 19:17.460
every historian that I would talk to would say, oh no, or every social scientist, no, this can't happen because X, Y, or Z.

19:17.460 --> 19:29.960
Well, if that won't happen, then how about this? No, no, that can't happen. In short, none of them would ever be willing to speculate on what's going to happen to India.

19:32.700 --> 19:45.960
And I pretty much had to work that out about a whole clock. So I had four drawer file cabinets and, oh, perhaps, 500 textbooks by the time I was done putting it all together.

19:46.720 --> 19:52.160
We also asked if the book reflects a serious effort on his part to work out what could happen in such a situation.

19:52.740 --> 20:03.600
Well, yes, seriously enough that some of my friends are friends of mine because, as political scientists or physicists or whatever,

20:03.600 --> 20:21.740
they read the book and said, ooh, an awful lot of scholarly research has gone into this, son, as a guy, and we would meet somewhere and get to be good friends.

20:23.360 --> 20:34.280
That doesn't say much about the popularity of a book, although systemic shock has been a bestseller in science fiction terms anyway.

20:35.260 --> 20:46.440
But it does say a lot about whether or not the work I did is appreciated by experts, and it does seem to be appreciated by experts.

20:46.440 --> 21:03.540
That's the thing that gets to them the most is that the existing problems of Islam, of India, of how Japan and China are going to work out,

21:04.060 --> 21:09.360
the problems that the United States will have, the problems that the Soviets will have 20 years from now, et cetera,

21:09.360 --> 21:16.100
that it simply grips all those bulls by the horns and wrestles them all at the same time.

21:17.140 --> 21:19.600
We wondered if Ying was a military strategy buff.

21:20.300 --> 21:38.560
Well, in a small way, yes, and Reginald Bretner, who is one of the better known science fiction writers and writers about science fiction as well as writers off science fiction,

21:38.560 --> 21:43.440
and Reg has done a book on military strategy.

21:44.280 --> 21:53.360
I listen to him a lot, and of course I borrow stuff from his libraries from time to time.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.880
So, yes, strategy is of some interest.

21:56.780 --> 22:00.140
We'll talk about Dening's systemic shock in more detail in our next show.

22:06.520 --> 22:15.700
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:00.140 --> 23:03.440
And next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:19.140 --> 23:24.420
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:27.020 --> 23:28.720
And here are your hosts.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.300
This is Daryl Lane.

23:34.380 --> 23:34.960
And Bill Vernon.

23:35.360 --> 23:39.440
We're talking with Dening about his fascinating 1981 science fiction novel, Systemic Shock.

23:39.820 --> 23:45.900
The book is an immensely detailed scenario of what the world would be like if the Third World War, a nuclear one, broke out.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.960
The protagonist of Systemic Shock is a young man named Quantrill.

23:49.460 --> 23:53.440
After the war starts, he becomes a skilled assassin for what's left of the United States government.

23:53.440 --> 23:57.860
Quantrill doesn't seem to be cast in the mold of the stereotype to science fiction hero.

23:58.560 --> 24:03.620
Well, I entirely agree. Quantrill is not a hero.

24:04.300 --> 24:12.360
Quantrill is a youngster with some very unusual characteristics.

24:13.360 --> 24:22.640
He has abilities that make him very likely to be useful for assassin jobs and so forth.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.580
Does this make him a hero? Not by any means.

24:26.080 --> 24:34.440
For all of his rare abilities, Quantrill is also a great potential to be misused.

24:35.600 --> 24:41.080
He could be a great metaphorically speaking, you know.

24:41.160 --> 24:52.040
He could be an Olympic type pistol as a tool, or he could be a setting tonight special as a tool.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.500
He could be used well, or he could be grossly misused.

24:56.460 --> 25:01.520
And Quantrill is not a genius by any means. There are lots and lots of flaws in the young man.

25:03.280 --> 25:07.840
And he is misused grossly for quite a while.

25:09.320 --> 25:13.300
You can't really very much call a man like that a hero.

25:13.300 --> 25:23.020
And I didn't. I wanted to show Quantrill with all of his foibles and his fingers.

25:24.080 --> 25:29.080
A subplot in the book concerns a refugee family trying to survive on the harsh plateaus of South Texas.

25:29.460 --> 25:33.400
When the mother and father die, only a young girl child, Sandy, is left.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.460
Ying has her adopted, sort of, by a huge Russian boar.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.920
We asked Ying the reason behind this episode.

25:39.920 --> 25:55.900
It happens to be the opinion of zoologists and animal husbandry folks that a pig next to a chimpanzee is just about the most intelligent animal around.

25:57.460 --> 26:07.880
And we know that other animals have adopted human beings, children, babies.

26:08.840 --> 26:16.220
When you find that pigs are that smart, and that they do sometimes really like human beings,

26:17.240 --> 26:26.000
then I wondered how likely it would be that a huge Russian boar might be filmed a tiny human being.

26:27.820 --> 26:37.220
Now, it's also true, and you probably know that as well as I, that around Edwards Plateau there in South Central Texas, there are Russian boars.

26:38.940 --> 26:44.760
Big ones. None of them anything like a thousand pounds.

26:46.000 --> 26:56.440
But having studied it, I found that the biggest Russian boar on record were something like five hundred and fifty pounds.

26:57.160 --> 27:02.620
And a Russian boar that big would be about the size of, almost the size of a Shetland pony.

27:05.260 --> 27:19.500
So it didn't seem to me so terribly unlikely, but that an extremely intelligent hog might befriend a human being,

27:19.600 --> 27:23.960
especially if that human being were completely without weapons of any kind.

27:24.920 --> 27:29.360
Systemic shock is an exceptionally good read, both exciting and thought-provoking.

27:29.360 --> 27:36.340
And readers will be interested to know that there are two sequels. The first is called Single Combat, and it will be out in paperback in October of 1983.

27:36.940 --> 27:44.380
The third book in the series is entitled Wild Country. Ying hasn't finished writing that one yet, but it does say it deals with the later years of Quantrill.

27:51.280 --> 27:59.900
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
