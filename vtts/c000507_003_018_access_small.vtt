Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.380 --> 00:33.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.000
And here are your hosts.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.100
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.320 --> 00:48.740
With this show, we're beginning a look at the fascinating writing career of science fiction author Charles Harness.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.440
Born and raised in Texas, Harness completed his university in law studies in Washington, D.C.

00:53.620 --> 01:00.080
From 1946 to 1953, Harness produced 13 short stories and two novels. One of the novels, The Rose, is a classic.

01:00.080 --> 01:07.060
Harness completed law school in 1946, so in those years, he was striving to establish a career as a patent lawyer and to support his family.

01:07.320 --> 01:12.020
Right, and it was the financial strain confronting his young family that encouraged Harness to write science fiction.

01:12.020 --> 01:21.560
I was working in Washington as a mineral economist during the war and going to law school.

01:24.980 --> 01:40.840
My daughter was born in 1946 and there were some bills to be paid. We needed the money, so I sat down and wrote my first science fiction story, which was time travel.

01:41.980 --> 01:53.600
And this was bought by what was then a standing. And I thought, well gee, do they pay money for this stuff?

01:53.980 --> 01:58.620
So I thought, perhaps I should turn out some more of it, which I did.

01:59.540 --> 02:03.440
So Harness got the writing bug and was able to work full time and to write for a few years.

02:03.800 --> 02:08.080
But he did stop writing in 1953 and he wasn't heard from again until 1966.

02:08.080 --> 02:11.040
Here's what he told us when we asked him about that long gap.

02:12.040 --> 02:21.760
I wrote for a while until my daughter got old enough to demand more and more of my time, so the writing had to come to an end.

02:23.180 --> 02:33.060
And it didn't really resume again until she was ready to go off to college. This was in 1964 and I picked it up again.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.880
Two of these early stories Harness published under the pseudonym Leonard Lockhart.

02:38.180 --> 02:44.000
The second of the two, that professional look, was a joint effort between Harness and Theodore Thomas, another Patton lawyer.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.960
Here Harness describes the genesis of these stories and their eventual course.

02:47.960 --> 02:52.520
At 10 and 9 we were in the Patton Department at Sinomid together.

02:53.420 --> 02:57.860
I wrote the first Leonard Lockhart story, The Unprobable Profession.

02:59.200 --> 03:10.200
And at that time he was writing science articles for the Stanford Advocate, as well as being in the Patton Department at Sinomid.

03:10.740 --> 03:18.860
So I said to him, why don't you and I start this series of stories about a Patton attorney and his problems.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.400
Here's the first one. He said, yeah, we can do that.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.420
So I wrote the first one, you wrote the second one. No, together we wrote the second one. That was half and half.

03:32.080 --> 03:37.380
And after that I left Sinomid and went to Grace and he continued the series.

03:37.380 --> 03:47.560
So number three is an all-subsequence story, or it is, even though the name Leonard Lockhart is still used on him.

03:54.900 --> 04:05.140
Harness's active writing periods were 1946 and 1953, during which he produced 13 short stories and the two novels, Flight Into Yesteryear, also published as a paradox man in The Rose.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.700
1966 and 1968 were six short stories in the novel The Ring of Ritternell.

04:11.340 --> 04:19.360
In 1974, The Present would saw publication of Wolfhead, The Catalyst, Firebird, and The Venetian Court, along with three short stories.

04:19.860 --> 04:25.320
Many of Harness's works feature mystical elements. Apparently this aspect of life has influenced Harness a great deal.

04:25.980 --> 04:34.180
I did go to a ministerial school at TCU at one time. This was long, long ago.

04:35.260 --> 04:41.120
And they threw me out for reasons I won't go into here. But it was a wise decision.

04:42.080 --> 04:46.780
But I've never lost a mystic slant to lots of things.

04:47.580 --> 04:51.040
On our next show, we'll begin to look at Harness's most famous work, The Rose.

04:58.180 --> 05:06.760
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:07.980 --> 06:13.240
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.580
And here are your hosts.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.620
This is Daryl Lane. And Bill Vernon.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.720
1953 marked the publication of a little-known science fiction classic. Charles Harness's short novel entitled The Rose.

06:30.060 --> 06:33.240
And we have to say little known because of the curious history of the book.

06:33.500 --> 06:38.540
Right. First of all, Harness attempted to sell a book in the United States markets, but the editors were unwilling to buy it.

06:38.980 --> 06:43.020
He then had to sell it in England to a relatively obscure magazine, Authentic Science Fiction.

06:44.020 --> 06:50.640
My agent at the time, Forest Akerman of, I think, Los Angeles, paddled it around here and there.

06:51.000 --> 07:00.380
Nobody in this country would buy it. It went to John Camel, and he wrote a nice two-line letter bug. He just couldn't use it.

07:00.820 --> 07:10.240
It wasn't the kind of thing that any science fiction magazine or fantasy and science fiction magazine was publishing at the time.

07:10.240 --> 07:15.820
And I should have known better for writing it. But I wanted to write it, so I did.

07:17.660 --> 07:25.500
And finally, Akerman sold it to this little authentic magazine in England, and they published it.

07:26.140 --> 07:29.720
Authentic was under the editorship of H.J. Campbell when The Rose was published.

07:30.200 --> 07:35.780
Publication of The Rose is considered to be the capstone achievement in the generally mediocre 85 issue run of the magazine.

07:35.780 --> 07:40.920
It would have languished in the pages of Authentic were it not for the fact that the British critics absolutely loved it.

07:41.320 --> 07:45.320
Arthur Clark, Judith Merrill, Brian Aldis, and in particular Michael Morkock praised it.

07:45.680 --> 07:51.680
It was through the almost single-handed efforts of Morkock that The Rose was published in book form, again in England, some years later.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.840
Arthur Clark saw it, got the Morkock for it.

07:56.380 --> 08:08.580
And Morkock, who was getting them through the editableness over there at that time, asked to have his people, Compact Books, publish it.

08:09.540 --> 08:13.460
And we haven't had a contract for it, and they did publish it.

08:14.180 --> 08:21.260
Then it was picked up fairly quickly by two other British outfits in hardcover form.

08:22.500 --> 08:28.920
And of course they had to pad it out with the two other stories to make it in a book size.

08:29.760 --> 08:36.260
The two short stories added to pad the length of the volume in which The Rose was finally published are The New Reality and The Chess Players.

08:36.540 --> 08:42.820
The New Reality, written in 1950 and first published in Thrilling Wonder Stories, is considered to be Harness Finest short story.

08:42.820 --> 08:48.560
The Chess Players is a clever little story based on the trouble it develops when a chess club encounters a chess-playing rat.

08:48.820 --> 08:53.040
In fact, many of Harness's works allude to chess. We ask him if he enjoys the game.

09:15.500 --> 09:21.140
It wasn't until 1969 that The Rose was made available in the United States, thanks to the efforts of Damon Knight.

09:21.580 --> 09:24.480
Berkeley published it then, and so far that has been the only American edition.

09:53.540 --> 10:02.800
It struck us that one reason The Rose could not find a United States publisher in 1953 was that American readers simply were not ready for a book heavy on the metaphysical rather than the hardware.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.740
We ask Harness if he might agree.

10:12.820 --> 10:18.300
Everybody was guided pretty much by the Dean of Science Fiction, John Camel, and he was a hardware man.

10:19.780 --> 10:24.500
And everything had to obey the laws of physics or it would be unacceptable.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.180
More about The Rose on our next show.

10:33.360 --> 10:42.500
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.520
The Rose on our next show.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.580
Stay with us.

11:57.180 --> 11:59.020
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

11:59.260 --> 12:03.880
On our last show we talked with science fiction author Charles Harness about his classic short novel, The Rose.

12:04.480 --> 12:13.720
We learned how The Rose was enthusiastically embraced by the British critics, yet it wasn't published in the United States until 16 years had elapsed from its initial publication in an obscure British magazine.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.560
In this show we'll look at some of the literary aspects of The Rose.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.980
Many of Harness's earlier works were written hastily, but we hasten to add not clumsily.

12:21.420 --> 12:24.320
The Rose, on the other hand, required a considerable length of time for completion.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.920
That was one of the stories where I didn't know how it was going to come out.

12:29.980 --> 12:35.100
And in fact, I worked on that one for two years, Bill. This is not a two-month slide.

12:37.320 --> 12:44.000
I read all the books on the arts in the Stanford Public Library. This is one year.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.140
I took notes on them for an entire two-week vacation one year.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.360
And then it gradually began to come together.

12:55.800 --> 13:07.840
And I used, of course, as you've seen in the story, Oscar Wilde's story of the Nightingale and the Rose, which I'd read many years before and I was quite impressed by it.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.940
Harness also filled us in on some other details about the writing of the Rose.

13:12.260 --> 13:16.200
For instance, its early incarnations were longer and it originally had another name.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.980
Let me give you a little bit more history on this.

13:22.060 --> 13:30.220
There was a time when the Rose was in a longer form and it had the name not the Rose, but invitation.

13:31.620 --> 13:45.760
It was an intergalactic thing where the Earth was being examined to see whether it would be admitted into a galactic relevant.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.700
And it didn't have the ending that it now has.

13:51.680 --> 13:57.180
Damon Knight liked that, but he couldn't get his publishers to accept it.

13:57.780 --> 14:07.680
This again was a year or so before it came out and it's in authentic and it's short form.

14:10.740 --> 14:16.600
So at that point I said, maybe I'm going to shorten this thing down, give it a different ending.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.320
So I did.

14:19.760 --> 14:24.980
I cut it from 45,000 words down to, I think it's about 30,000.

14:28.360 --> 14:34.900
And it's Ackerman, Dan was able to spell it, he's authentic in England.

14:36.020 --> 14:38.140
The central theme of the Rose is difficult to capsule.

14:38.640 --> 14:42.480
It's a love story involving two central characters, Rui Jacques and Anne of Antal.

14:43.140 --> 14:46.160
It's set in the midst of a future confrontation between science and art.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.120
And it describes a transcendental evolution of man into Superman.

14:49.120 --> 14:56.180
Harness and his brother Billy, who as we should learn in a later show, died when Harness was still in high school, were the models for the central characters.

14:57.480 --> 15:02.560
Rui Jacques again resembles my brother a great deal.

15:06.740 --> 15:23.600
And if you can visualize that guy with his sarcasm, his biting wit, his contempt for all, all the, well, I don't know.

15:23.600 --> 15:35.040
But he was a, he had a high personal integrity and a impatience with convention and so on.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.840
At least in his head he did.

15:40.460 --> 15:43.740
And I wanted to get him into print.

15:45.440 --> 15:52.480
And of course Anne of Antal is me, although I had to take on a female form to make it effective.

15:53.780 --> 16:04.160
I would have, at one time I would have been pleased to die if it would bring him back, but of course that would just be the story.

16:05.980 --> 16:10.720
But it was a thought and it was a psychic force driving the story.

16:11.500 --> 16:15.620
Do yourself a favor, find a copy of the rose in your local used bookstore and read it.

16:22.480 --> 16:30.980
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.540
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:34.100 --> 17:39.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.680
And here are your hosts.

17:47.920 --> 17:48.920
This is Daryl Lane.

17:49.040 --> 17:49.660
And Bill Vernon.

17:50.040 --> 17:55.320
In 1968, Berkeley published Charles Harness' novel, The Ring of Ritternell, his first work to appear in 15 years.

17:55.580 --> 17:59.580
It's the story of two brothers, one a lawyer, the other a poet, in a far distant future.

18:00.260 --> 18:04.260
He or Harness, who is himself a lawyer, tells us about the very personal inspiration for the poet.

18:05.220 --> 18:10.420
My brother Billy was several years older than I, in fact he was nine years older than I.

18:11.340 --> 18:16.880
And he died when I was just about to graduate from high school.

18:17.120 --> 18:22.080
He had tumors of the brain, which in those days were inoperable.

18:22.300 --> 18:29.440
Today they don't, it wouldn't be too much trouble to operate if they couldn't do it then.

18:30.420 --> 18:36.100
So I have remembered him and I have never let him go.

18:37.500 --> 18:43.780
And he has done in several of my stories The Ring of Ritternell.

18:44.260 --> 18:53.380
He was the brother who was destroyed by the chief bad guy, but his brain was retained.

18:53.920 --> 18:54.880
He was the poet.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.880
His name was Omer.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.560
In 1977, Wolfhead, Harness' fourth novel came out.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.180
It was his first novel in nine years.

19:04.460 --> 19:10.520
Wolfhead describes a post-atomic holocaust America and the struggle between various cultures that populate the desolate land.

19:10.980 --> 19:15.880
Harness told us that when he wrote Wolfhead, he went against the conventional wisdom that one shouldn't write about certain subjects.

19:16.800 --> 19:23.420
I started out writing it. I thought I would do a thing which is ground upon.

19:23.420 --> 19:27.320
You're not supposed to write post-atomic novels.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.980
It's really unacceptable.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.300
But here seem to be a good one.

19:35.460 --> 19:40.720
A real life character, Richard Nixon, inspired Harness' characterization of the malevolent leader of the underworld.

19:41.460 --> 19:46.240
Well, I thought, see, here's this guy. He's about to take over the country.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.440
Anything he does is okay just because he says so.

19:50.440 --> 19:55.240
And I'm going to have a character like that in Wolfhead.

19:57.800 --> 20:02.380
So I put him in there. He was the president of the underworld.

20:03.480 --> 20:08.180
And he would come out and rule the upper world, except he didn't.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.760
Even the wolf of the title was inspired by a real life dog.

20:12.580 --> 20:21.600
The wolf was modeled at the time on an Alaskan Husky dog that lived next door to us.

20:22.900 --> 20:27.240
And she and I were great friends, so I thought I'd put her in it.

20:28.100 --> 20:31.640
When Harness reminisced about Wolfhead, he told us he was pretty much pleased by it.

20:32.160 --> 20:36.700
It's one of my happier efforts. It's not really serious.

20:38.100 --> 20:43.940
Well, some of it is. You know, at one time it had a different ending.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.200
Of course, we had to ask Harness about that different ending.

20:47.620 --> 20:50.560
Keep in mind that during his writing career, he was a full-time patent attorney.

20:51.240 --> 20:55.640
The answer to this question provides an interesting insight into other ways the real world can intrude into fiction.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.520
And I have to cough when I think about it. Excuse me while I cough.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.080
This is a psychological cough.

21:11.280 --> 21:16.060
In the original ending, the girl lived.

21:17.380 --> 21:25.440
But I got involved in some chemical litigation that I lost.

21:27.380 --> 21:32.700
And I was so angry and so disappointed, I said, somebody has to die.

21:33.660 --> 21:41.440
So I killed the heroine and wrote some poetry for her benefit so she wouldn't feel too badly about it.

21:42.140 --> 21:45.560
And that's the poetry, of course, is in the front and in the back.

21:47.660 --> 21:50.480
So that's a little sidelight on that.

21:50.980 --> 21:53.380
We'll have more with Charles Harness on our next show.

22:00.360 --> 22:05.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:06.040 --> 22:08.940
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:10.740 --> 23:16.600
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:19.420 --> 23:20.900
And here are your hosts.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.380
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

23:27.540 --> 23:31.400
Science fiction author Charles Harness began writing in earnest again in the late 70s,

23:31.620 --> 23:33.420
and he produced three novels in short order.

23:33.940 --> 23:36.880
The Catalyst is the story of a patent lawyer who works for a chemical company.

23:37.280 --> 23:40.160
In this respect, it resembles some short stories Harness wrote a decade earlier,

23:40.480 --> 23:42.500
the Alchemist and an ornament to his profession.

23:42.500 --> 23:47.880
The Catalyst actually started out as a longer mainstream novel, but Harness, unable to sell it,

23:47.980 --> 23:49.460
fixed it up as a science fiction work.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.680
His brother figured heavily in this book, too.

24:12.500 --> 24:12.980
This is a story of a man who was in the first department.

24:16.080 --> 24:22.960
And one of the stories there involved a peculiar whistle,

24:23.680 --> 24:31.540
which was derived from cheap, may safely graze by Johann Sebastian Bach.

24:32.660 --> 24:35.960
But that long version never sold, and I thought,

24:35.960 --> 24:37.720
well, I'm not going to let it die.

24:38.260 --> 24:43.140
I will convert it to a science fiction work with all the proper trappings

24:44.300 --> 24:48.580
and things you need to call it science fiction, which I did.

24:49.620 --> 24:53.980
In 1981, Harness published a novel that was sort of a throwback to his early period,

24:54.220 --> 24:55.440
Galaxy Galloping Days.

24:56.320 --> 25:00.480
Firebird is made up of early Harness devices, such as a time loop and the rebirth of the cosmos.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.580
Here, Harness tells us about the basis for the story in Firebird.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.760
I'm sure you recognize the basic story here.

25:08.220 --> 25:10.060
This is Tristan and his shoulder.

25:11.820 --> 25:16.100
I don't know whether you go in for Wagner or not,

25:16.420 --> 25:23.740
but it is his shoulder and Tristan drinking what she thinks is the poison drink,

25:24.600 --> 25:29.240
but it's his lovely lecture again, and they fall in love.

25:29.240 --> 25:36.660
And after that, just about everything parallels the Tristan and his shoulder story

25:36.660 --> 25:45.940
as you would find it in Wagner's opera, including Death of the Man and the Flight.

25:46.900 --> 25:50.620
Editor David Hartwell of Pocket Books also influenced Harness's approach to this novel.

25:50.620 --> 25:58.280
In the beginning, when I first wrote David Hartwell of Pocket Books,

25:59.740 --> 26:04.080
I should mention he is a medieval scholar.

26:04.280 --> 26:08.060
This is what he got his PhD in English in.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.580
And he was quite familiar with the Tristan legend from there,

26:14.560 --> 26:22.380
and he found Welsh origins for it, and he had me change the names to look like Welsh names.

26:23.740 --> 26:27.860
And he said, make him more of a Renaissance knight,

26:28.420 --> 26:31.160
and I put in some chaff, which is easy enough.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.380
So, there's something that looked like a chaff thing.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.780
I worked it into the plot, and it came out okay.

26:40.660 --> 26:43.800
But it is a never-content, no-for-nothing contribution.

27:03.260 --> 27:06.860
Harness is retired from his lifelong profession of being a patent attorney.

27:06.860 --> 27:10.880
He's recently produced a couple of short stories in a novel, and more are in the works.

27:11.300 --> 27:15.320
He's a gentleman who, while working full-time, produced a small body of quality science fiction.

27:15.620 --> 27:17.180
We asked him how he wishes to be remembered.

27:18.180 --> 27:23.220
My request there is, please forget me, let me sink into oblivion,

27:24.040 --> 27:30.040
let the waves wash up over the sand, and everything disappears.

27:31.660 --> 27:32.540
Honest to God.

27:32.540 --> 27:35.780
We somehow doubt that Mr. Harness will be forgotten.

27:43.020 --> 27:45.540
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

27:45.880 --> 27:48.500
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

27:48.500 --> 27:51.640
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.720
