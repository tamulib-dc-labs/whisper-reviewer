Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.800
And here are your hosts.

00:44.100 --> 00:52.440
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. James Gunn approaches science fiction from
many angles. He writes it, he teaches it, and he's published important

00:52.440 --> 01:00.960
historical and critical material on science fiction. Some of Gunn's better-known
novels include The Joymakers, The Immortals, The Listeners, and The Dreamers.

01:01.180 --> 01:09.180
The Immortals was the basis for the television show of a few years back, The
Immortal. Gunn's critical work, in addition to numerous essays, consists of two

01:09.180 --> 01:18.380
major publications, Alternate Worlds, a 1975 History of Science Fiction, and The
Road to Science Fiction, a four-volume anthology that includes Gunn's essays on

01:18.380 --> 01:24.900
the definition of science fiction and its historical development. Gunn's
criticism is valuable because it not only comes from someone who knows the

01:24.900 --> 01:33.460
field, but also because Gunn is a scholar and professor at a major university.
He brings the insight of a professional academic to the field. We talked with

01:33.460 --> 01:40.900
Gunn about how he divides himself between being both a writer and a teacher. We
asked him if he'd ever considered writing as a full-time career. I did,

01:41.100 --> 01:52.520
as a matter of fact, write full-time for a period of a little more than three
years. A year in 1948-49.

01:54.700 --> 02:09.020
And I went back to school then and got a master's degree. But I continued to
write. and then after I'd worked for this paperback publisher, after I got my

02:09.020 --> 02:17.400
master's degree, worked for that paperback publisher for a year and a half, I
found out that I'd sold four stories that I hadn't known about and decided to go

02:17.400 --> 02:39.300
back to full-time writing. So I did write full-time from the fall of 1942 until
the late summer of 1955, and really much of the groundwork for the later books

02:39.300 --> 02:52.660
that I published and the success that I had, I think, such as it was, was based
upon that freelance period. I didn't make a lot of money at it below the poverty

02:52.660 --> 03:07.840
level, but my needs were fairly simple at that time, and what had later paid off
in the sense that the stories that I wrote appeared in books, and some of them

03:07.840 --> 03:20.840
even were made in the movies and all that sort of thing. Gunn explains how he
became involved in teaching. It was after 1955, or in the fall of 1955, after my

03:20.840 --> 03:31.880
wife and I had moved back to Lawrence, Kansas, simply as a place to live, but I
got involved almost by accident with teaching at the university, from which I'd

03:31.880 --> 03:44.040
gotten my two degrees, University of Kansas, and became involved with other
aspects of the university, edited the alumni magazine for three years, and then

03:44.040 --> 03:55.920
became director of public relations for the university for 12 years, before
returning to full-time teaching and writing in 1970. Gunn had always intended to

03:55.920 --> 04:11.920
write science fiction criticism. But looking back upon it, I know, I think right
from the beginning, I had the feeling that I wanted to do criticism in the area.

04:12.800 --> 04:28.360
My first ten stories, for instance, were published under a pseudonym of Edwin
James. I began to use my own name with the eleventh story. But the reason that I

04:28.360 --> 04:40.460
can remember now for doing that was the fact that I thought I would write
criticism about science fiction, and I wanted to save my real name for that. But

04:40.460 --> 04:55.740
after ten stories, I decided that was foolish, and I ought to use my real name
for everything. But that, looking back upon it, I think the academic interest

04:55.740 --> 05:03.280
was there right from the beginning. Beginning next time, we'll talk with James
Gunn about his writing, both the stories and the criticism.

05:10.620 --> 05:18.700

06:06.240 --> 06:10.260
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:26.460 --> 06:31.840
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.280
And here are your hosts.

06:40.740 --> 06:49.240
This is Bill Vernon. And Daryl Lane. James Gunn, author, critic, and teacher of
science fiction, has written some valuable books on the definition and

06:49.240 --> 06:57.080
historical development of science fiction. He's examining some big questions in
this work. Things like, what is science fiction? What makes it different from

06:57.080 --> 07:05.020
other literature? And where it comes from? And since Gunn is a professor at the
University of Kansas, besides being a long-time author of science fiction, he

07:05.020 --> 07:13.860
combines a scholar's objectivity and a creator's understanding in answering
these questions. Alternate Worlds, published in 1976, is his first major

07:13.860 --> 07:25.600
critical work. Gunn explains its origin. I had, when I first went back to full
-time teaching, had been asked if I would teach a science fiction course, which

07:25.600 --> 07:39.160
is different from the experience at most universities, where there is some
resistance to the notion of doing that. And I accepted because I had the feeling

07:39.160 --> 07:55.200
that there wasn't a good history of science fiction and that this course would
give me the incentive to write it. So I sat down and wrote very fast and ended

07:55.200 --> 08:04.820
up with 13 chapters representing about 13 lectures for the 14-week semester.

08:06.240 --> 08:24.300
And these chapters or these lectures became the 13 chapters in a book of mine,
which appeared in about, I guess, 75, after some delays, as Alternate Worlds,

08:24.640 --> 08:36.320
the illustrated history of science fiction. But as one consequence of its
publication, I got a call one day from an editor at New American Library who was

08:36.320 --> 08:55.480
admiring it and asked me if I'd like to do a book for them. And I knew also that
I really felt the need for anthologies which covered more than the brief span of

08:55.480 --> 09:11.280
the 20s to the 60s, which most anthologies did. And there really wasn't much in
the 20s or 30s. Most of it covered the period of the 40s and 50s. So I said yes,

09:11.280 --> 09:26.460
and I sent them a proposal for the first volume of the wrote science fiction. At
that time, all we knew that there would be would be one volume, which covered

09:26.460 --> 09:45.060
the period from the earliest prehistory of literature, not to mention science
fiction. Up to 1900 and the H.G. Wells' early stories and novels. The volume

09:45.060 --> 09:52.740
used a unique and valuable approach to science fiction criticism. It was an
anthology of stories, but each story was accompanied by an essay, which covered

09:52.740 --> 10:01.360
the story's importance and also discussed the period of science fiction history
to which it belonged. Gunn explains how that volume led to others. By the time I

10:01.360 --> 10:10.380
got finished with the manuscript, I had felt that it really, unlike most books,
came out even better than I thought it was going to, and I proposed that we go

10:10.380 --> 10:26.380
ahead with a second and third volume. They said, let's wait and see how this
does. And eventually, after it had done better than they thought, they agreed

10:26.380 --> 10:28.400
that I could go on to volume two and three,

10:31.300 --> 10:49.000
which covered the period from 1900 to approximately 1940, and then from 1940 to
1970 or 70, actually the latest one, 76, I think. Gunn has recently published a

10:49.000 --> 10:56.220
fourth volume in the series and says that it's now finished. The title for the
entire series is The Road to Science Fiction, and it stands as a major work of

10:56.220 --> 11:00.360
science fiction criticism. We'll talk some more about it with James Gunn next
time.

11:07.640 --> 11:15.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

11:15.640 --> 11:16.420
Odessa, Texas.

12:02.040 --> 12:06.040
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:22.060 --> 12:27.540
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:30.220 --> 12:31.980
And here are your hosts.

12:36.360 --> 12:44.160
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. James Gunn is noted not only as an author
of science fiction, but as a critic of the field and as a chronicler in the

12:44.160 --> 12:52.420
story of its development. Gunn has recently completed the last volume in his
four-volume series, The Road to Science Fiction. In this unique work, he traces

12:52.420 --> 12:59.700
the development of science fiction from the very beginning of recorded
literature until the present day. What's different and valuable about Gunn's

12:59.700 --> 13:06.980
approach in The Road to Science Fiction is that he uses the actual literature
itself, from tales belonging to the ancient world to modern short stories. But

13:06.980 --> 13:15.320
each literary selection is accompanied by an essay which discusses the work's
importance and deals with the historical period to which it belongs. When using

13:15.320 --> 13:21.980
the volumes, then, a reader not only is getting some good science fiction, but
he's picking up an education relating to the definition and development of

13:21.980 --> 13:30.820
science fiction. Except for the last one, each volume is also organized around a
particular thesis or point. The first one, for instance, develops the idea that

13:30.820 --> 13:41.660
before real science fiction could exist, mankind had to recognize the concept of
change. It seems to me that the essential nature of science fiction is that it

13:41.660 --> 13:55.800
deals with change. In fact, in order for us to recognize a story or a novel as
being science fiction, we have to identify that part of it which is different

13:55.800 --> 14:07.420
from here and now, our everyday world. And so it deals with how people would
react in changed circumstances.

14:10.120 --> 14:25.760
So up to approximately the time of the Investor Revolution, the very concept of
change itself was alien to human minds. It seems to me, looking back over the

14:25.760 --> 14:45.560
history of humanity, that mostly people saw change as being only the eternal
circle of the seasons changing from spring to summer to fall to winter and back

14:45.560 --> 15:00.000
again. And it wasn't until the Investor Revolution and, of course, the
scientific perception that preceded it and accompanied it, which began to create

15:00.000 --> 15:16.100
change that people saw could be beneficial, and over which they might be able to
exercise some control. That is, it was man-made change created by human desires

15:16.100 --> 15:30.380
and intelligence, and it could be controlled by humanity's exercise of
intelligence. And it seems to me that science fiction was the literary response

15:30.380 --> 15:40.320
to that recognition. The next two volumes develop other ideas that Dunn believes
are essential to the development of science fiction. The notion, for instance,

15:40.440 --> 15:48.220
that mankind is a species, rather than isolated tribes or nations or races. But
the last volume is a bit different. This is because it deals with the most

15:48.220 --> 15:56.880
recent science fiction stories, and it's more difficult to tell which ones will
be important. In the more current stories, this is much more difficult to

15:56.880 --> 16:08.580
determine. You can't really say what stories are important until much after
they've been published, and you can't certainly say which are typical until you

16:08.580 --> 16:23.860
decide what the period really stands for. So what I did in the fourth volume was
to select stories that I thought dealt with the literary uses of science

16:23.860 --> 16:35.880
fiction. And so that, the volume, is primarily concerned not with questions of
generic importance, but the question of literary uses. Gunn has performed a

16:35.880 --> 16:43.140
valuable service to the field with the four volumes in his The Road to Science
Fiction series. By defining science fiction, by demonstrating what makes it

16:43.140 --> 16:51.740
different from other types of literature, and by revealing its origins, he's
made science fiction more understandable and more respectable. Next time we'll

16:51.740 --> 16:53.200
talk with Gunn about his own fiction.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin

17:53.160 --> 17:59.720
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:15.700 --> 18:21.040
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:23.940 --> 18:25.480
And here are your hosts.

18:30.060 --> 18:39.080
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane. In much of his science fiction, James Gunn
examines the question of what makes man happy. He extrapolates a future which

18:39.080 --> 18:47.760
seems plausible from current social conditions and asks the standard science
fiction question, what if? In his 1963 novel, The Joymakers, he fills out the

18:47.760 --> 18:55.760
question by asking what if man discovered a drug that would make him perfectly
happy, even though it would remove him from the real world. Gunn answers the

18:55.760 --> 19:04.560
question by saying that man would probably accept the opportunity. And then he
shows what would happen to man and society as a result. Ultimately, as it worked

19:04.560 --> 19:13.940
out in the novel, it turned out that the people who wanted happiness to get what
they want,

19:16.960 --> 19:28.100
since what one can get in the external world is limited by the number of people
and the number of people who want this particular thing, ultimately they get

19:28.100 --> 19:43.420
what they want by being fed illusions that they get what they want. And
ultimately everybody ends up floating in amniotic cells living on dreams of

19:43.420 --> 19:56.200
success and accomplishment fed by a machine, which I eventually worked out to be
that you're happy when you don't want anything anymore. And it occurred to me

19:56.200 --> 20:10.400
that that is the same as death. And ultimately the equation for that is that
happiness equals death and that life is still wanting something. One of Gunn's

20:10.400 --> 20:19.640
more recent books, The Dreamers, also published in paperback as The Mind Master,
also presents a society in which man has presumably achieved perfect happiness.

20:20.000 --> 20:28.440
And he does so through chemical memory. Any possible experience can be felt by
an individual if he is injected with the DNA or RNA of someone who has actually

20:28.440 --> 20:47.320
undergone that experience. It is a comment on the fact that dreaming itself is a
non-survival characteristic. It may be the most satisfying, ultimately the most

20:47.320 --> 21:00.220
satisfying experience, but as perhaps I said in The Joymakers, it's perhaps
repeated here in a different way, that ultimate satisfaction or dreaming is a

21:00.220 --> 21:06.580
death activity and that survival

21:06.580 --> 21:18.820
demands something less than total satisfaction. Both The Joymakers and The
Dreamers, along with many of Gunn's other books, consist of a series of related

21:18.820 --> 21:27.180
novellas rather than being a straightforward novel. Gunn says that he started
this practice years ago, not long after he began writing science fiction, for a

21:27.180 --> 21:34.840
couple of reasons. It allowed him to be paid twice, since he could publish each
novella separately in a magazine before putting it with other novellas to make

21:34.840 --> 21:47.460
up a whole novel. And as a consequence, I have since that time mostly written my
novels in the form of publishable

21:47.460 --> 22:01.860
fragments for individual stories. And in a way, I think it's worked rather well,
because in The Joymakers, I was able to use as a framework, as a subject matter,

22:02.060 --> 22:14.500
really an idea rather than a person or a group of people. And so this novel,
which extended over about 200 years, picked up several different people, but

22:14.500 --> 22:24.400
basically was about one thing, the science of happiness. And similarly, The
Immortals, which also continued for about 200 years, and The Listeners, which

22:24.400 --> 22:26.680
covered about 150 years.

22:29.900 --> 22:41.560
And all of these seem to me to focus on an idea, which is what science fiction
mostly does. We'll continue with the work of James Gunn next time.

22:48.920 --> 22:56.860

Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:05.000 ---> 24:14.000
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy. 
And here are your hosts.

24:21.220 --> 24:29.060
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon. The science fiction of James Gunn is based
on strong, clear ideas that are developed in stories with a good deal of action

24:29.060 --> 24:38.280
in them. One of his better-known books, a 1962 novel entitled The Immortals, is
based on a classic science fiction premise. What if immortality were possible?

24:38.500 --> 24:47.160
What would it do to society and to human nature? The novel focuses on Marshall
Cartwright, who is immortal, and a search for him by Leroy Weaver, a dying

24:47.160 --> 24:56.940
millionaire who wants Cartwright's blood so that he himself can be immortal. But
the novel is more than a chase or a search. Certainly the notion of the search

24:56.940 --> 25:11.520
for the immortal, the person that I call Cartwright, Marshall Cartwright, was in
there to provide a core of interest. But I was primarily interested in the novel

25:11.520 --> 25:28.640
on the impact of the possibility of immortality on society itself and interested
in dealing with those kinds of impulses that people have relating to immortality

25:28.640 --> 25:40.220
and longevity. By examining people's reactions to immortality, Gunn hopes to
make a point about human nature. And in a certain sense, The Immortals embodies

25:40.220 --> 25:54.600
as well as anything else that I've written, my basic philosophical position in
my work that can be traced through almost all of it, I suspect, that there are

25:54.600 --> 26:08.420
no real villains in life. There are only people who want the same things
everybody else wants, but who are willing to do to get them things that other

26:08.420 --> 26:27.660
people are not willing to do. And that the best things in life can be wanted too
much. That anything that is considered good can be an evil. And I suppose one of

26:27.660 --> 26:41.580
the basic concepts with which I began, The Immortals, was the concept that
everybody thinks it would be wonderful to live forever. But what if you had a

26:41.580 --> 26:55.380
man who accidentally could live forever, but who also, whose blood could
rejuvenate other people, and his life would be made miserable? And from there,

26:55.560 --> 27:13.420
of course, the entire extrapolation about the ways in which society, knowing the
possibility of immortality, would force people, would force society, to pour

27:13.420 --> 27:25.660
more and more and more money into medicine until the law of diminishing returns
would mean

27:25.660 --> 27:36.580
that half of the world would be devoted to medicine and everybody else would be
starving in the slums. Gunn does indeed show the negative effects of

27:36.580 --> 27:45.500
immortality. He suggests that his pursuit would cause great social inequality,
cause medical costs to rise drastically, and would also create a society so

27:45.500 --> 27:53.980
obsessed with seeking to live forever that it would forget to live for now. In
1969, there was a television series based on The Immortals. We asked Gunn what

27:53.980 --> 28:06.520
he thought of it. Oh, I thought it was a total disaster. And that's not
uncommon, of course. But the resemblances between the novel and the book are

28:06.520 --> 28:20.500
very slight. My book starts with the immortal being a drifter who comes in and
sells a pint of blood and then disappears for the rest of the novel until the

28:20.500 --> 28:34.620
very end. And the television series is all about the immortal and his being
pursued. And eventually it turns into simply another search for the papers,

28:35.000 --> 28:40.740
another fugitive. Somebody is being chased, but it makes no real difference why
he's being chased.
