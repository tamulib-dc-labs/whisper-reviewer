00:01.420 --> 00:07.220
I checked up on my information, and the first thing I did was try to invent planets for

00:07.220 --> 00:07.740
these stars.

00:08.320 --> 00:12.760
That meant I had to figure out the mass so I'd know how far away the planets would, whether

00:12.760 --> 00:21.900
it's the mass and the radiation output, so I'd have to know how far away the planet and what length of year
they'd have, all these little, the things that makes a fun in science fiction

00:21.900 --> 00:23.880
writing. These damn plots are in this.

00:26.740 --> 00:38.960
Well, I came out with values from the spectroscopic evidence, and the blasted
white stars weren't big enough. They weren't massive enough. And they, to be as

00:38.960 --> 00:44.700
bright as they were, they should have had more mass than they possibly could
have from the spectroscopic data.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.740
And I began scratching my head furiously.

00:47.280 --> 00:52.580
Suddenly I had a brilliant notion, hey, maybe they aren't equal in each of the two systems.

00:53.120 --> 00:53.820
Maybe this is what I'm talking about.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.980
But I'm talking about what the astronomers call the single line binary.

00:56.440 --> 01:00.540
That is, one with one star much brighter than the other, and we get only one set of spectral

01:00.540 --> 01:03.520
lines, and we don't know anything really about the other star at all.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.840
So living, fortunately, in the same metropolis, it's certainly an astrophysicist.

01:09.220 --> 01:16.020
I called up and got a Xerox made of the original paper on the Caster system, which was done

01:16.020 --> 01:19.000
in 1906, and published in the Lick Observatory Bulletin.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.740
And that came with single line velocity curves.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.460
So I had to go and figure out what the stars were really like.

01:04.060 --> 01:14.680
me. I was just gone to the solar panel. I remember that morning I was gonna show
up until the hour and the moon went to the ocean.

01:28.140 --> 01:40.680
And the next slide I hope, if I didn't get out of order again, gives you a
pretty good idea. The yellow star in the middle is the sun. The, these two are

01:40.680 --> 01:54.480
the main components of the other two bright, of the two, bright, white stars in
character, and the red dwarf, this and this are reasonable values for the other

01:54.480 --> 02:05.000
stars. There are limitations to things... The system's not eclipsing, so it's
not edge on, so we don't know the exact tilt, so there's a big range of possible

02:05.000 --> 02:12.860
matters that I stuck with within the range which would make the stars too faint
to see and came out with answers

2:12.840 --> 02:14.840
I can't say are right, but are at least reasonable.

02:15.740 --> 02:20.120
The other system, the YY Genonarum Debout Right, this is the pond.

02:20.920 --> 02:30.040
And everything else, there's a couple of other warrants which you wouldn't be able to see from here, which I stuck into the system for purposes of the talk.

02:30.580 --> 02:32.000
This is another of the Star Trek ones.

02:35.180 --> 02:36.460
Okay, finally go.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.400
It's a beautiful system with lots of planets.

02:40.940 --> 02:42.420
I say there are lots of planets.

02:44.780 --> 02:54.760
A lot of science fiction writers have, this is not my painting by the way, this
is a John Dixon one. A lot of science fiction writers, when they sent their

02:54.760 --> 03:02.820
stories on planets of other stars, just picked the stars whose name they
happened to know without any regard to how likely it was to have planets, much

03:02.820 --> 03:15.820
less habitable ones. and Antares is a frequently used example since it's a nice
bright star seen from Earth or from practically anywhere else, and there you

03:15.820 --> 03:26.460
are. But there's a little bit of trouble with Antares, this is probably a pretty
accurate painting, it's a red giant, you can see down through the atmosphere for

03:26.460 --> 03:27.160
some distance,
but not as far as Poul Anderson once said in one of his stories.

03:31.640 --> 03:38.160
And I'm a little givious about any layer of the atmosphere looking at that, but it might.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.120
I have never been there, can't absolutely guarantee.

03:42.140 --> 03:47.500
But it is a super giant red type, it's in the very late in its career.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.740
If it ever had any habitable Earth type planets, the star has now expanded to engulf us.

03:53.540 --> 03:58.820
And where this world came from, the fiction hooked up, I really don't know.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.540
Antares was mentioned in Star Trek, though, and I had to cook up a few

04:05.940 --> 04:16.740
possibilities to play the game, and I'm quite sure the next two or three slides
deal with some of the possibilities. I had to face the presumed fact that the

04:16.740 --> 04:23.920
star is very old and the planets are very old. I had

04:23.920 --> 04:35.820
to cook up a place but where there could still reasonably be light, and I went
slightly overboard in typical science fiction writer's style, This is a probe

04:35.820 --> 04:45.480
going into Antares' photosphere itself, it's going in well above the local speed
of sound, all three of them are, so there are shockwaves around it, and the

04:45.480 --> 04:48.640
title of a picture was hot vacuum, which pretty well described the outer parts of Antares.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.060
And Paul is going down inside.

04:53.060 --> 04:58.260
Actually, my lifeform had existed on planets now and don't.

04:58.700 --> 05:14.720
At least at the technological level where they could transfer their intelligences, or at least copy themselves adequately into machines of a sort, solid-state devices of many, many cells,

05:14.720 --> 05:20.960
we saw them in something well beyond our present chip technique, but that's the basic idea.

05:21.540 --> 05:26.640
So they were relatively immune to such things as quite wide temperature changes.

05:27.300 --> 05:32.180
They fed on energy directly, and they lived commonly inside the star itself.

05:32.640 --> 05:37.500
So they occasionally had to go out to some of the surviving planets to get material.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.180
Because in a vacuum like that, you don't pick up very much food, and even if you do live off energy,

05:44.080 --> 05:49.440
you can't live in the energy environment at the same temperature as that environment.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.360
You need to eat things somewhere, so they had to leave the star occasionally.

05:53.060 --> 05:59.100
So I made this up for a talk. This is one of these slides that went with it, but I still agree with much the same.

06:00.640 --> 06:07.920
I claim that this was one of those times when the lights had been dimmed, and don't worry about it.

06:07.920 --> 06:13.720
This is an anteroid partly equipped behind one of the surviving building plants.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.140
And there's a big strong, stellar wind coming out from a red giant.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.300
Maybe it'll work. I don't count on it.

06:24.140 --> 06:32.820
It's a little bit better. Now this is one of the satellites, and on the
satellites, the Antarians had some of their technical equipment, which they

06:32.820 --> 06:42.280
couldn't very well build in the sky. I went to came up with a very brief story
about the, remember the good old Galileo that And it was always being wrecked,

06:42.360 --> 06:54.480
the shuttlecraft. It had to be the Galileo. It went poking around the inner
planet beneath the star itself. Okay, they met one of the neighbors and he was

06:54.480 --> 07:05.340
very helpful after they got everything settled. I couldn't find the other slide
just at the table. That was a neighbor floating around in space. He had actually

07:05.340 --> 07:16.620
was just a kid who was out there practically starving. He got in the
Enterprise's way, and the Enterprise wanted to get around him and he wouldn't

07:16.620 --> 07:20.680
move, and find where they fired a favor at him and got the answer. Thanks, I
needed that.

07:23.480 --> 07:27.040
This was gone through very briefly, I assure you, in the start.

07:28.620 --> 07:30.160
Okay, let's see.

07:31.980 --> 07:35.100
But that said, it sent friendly relations.

07:35.360 --> 07:49.200
Some of the natives and the enterprise went on into the star. One of the natives protecting the Enterprise from slightly excessive
radiation intensity.ternet, and they eventually found and rescued, the crew of

07:49.520 --> 07:59.200
the Galileo, you can't rescue a Galileo, it's got to be destroyed in one of the
rooms. Okay but the final picture I think was the destruction of the sub

07:59.200 --> 08:11.420
aircraft, yeah, there it went in a nice negative explosion as the uh, shields
went and absorbed a large amount of heat from the gas around it so the gas

08:11.420 --> 08:19.800
cooled down and stopped radiating, and so that you'd get a negative explosion
like that under the circumstances. And if you dot think I'm right, write your

08:19.800 --> 08:23.100
own story on that. Okay.

08:28.660 --> 08:40.420
This was another set I made to... I kind of hoped we'd get into the animated
Star Trek stuff. But, uh, didn't work. The star is S.S. Sidney. which is a

08:40.420 --> 08:52.760
binary one star much like the sun the other jumps above at the white dwarf stage
and every now and then as material is objected from the bigger sun it falls into

08:52.760 --> 09:05.140
the white dwarf and the heat generated by the fall as it compresses makes the
small star pop up like practically a nova the details uh you want to read from

09:05.140 --> 09:08.320
an article a two-part article by george bumford entitled

09:08.740 --> 09:16.300
The Dwarf Novid, the original on-site, appeared in early 1963 with the giant telescope,

09:17.300 --> 09:19.020
and that was the part of it.

09:19.400 --> 09:26.280
The next picture shows it's blazing in this little novice-sized behavior,

09:28.880 --> 09:32.360
and the next picture shows the planet that hooked up to the storm.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.120
It's here in the clean water world, practically solid water,

09:36.600 --> 09:38.340
water for about 2,000 miles,

09:38.300 --> 09:49.200
And I worked out an excuse for that, but let's not go into it now. As to
all the fifties. Now one of them, carbon-type life had developed. The other, the

09:49.200 --> 10:02.360
sea had a lot of dissolved ionic material, dissolved salts. And the life forms
were metal crystalloids, electable stuff. And the life on the carbon world has

10:02.360 --> 10:13.440
been just starting to develop space travel. had dropped a few probes over onto
the other world, not properly decontaminated, and the metal beings were having

10:13.440 --> 10:22.840
to set up a major industry in what they thought of as the flying control center,
destroying this stuff that was spreading over their oceans and cutting off the

10:22.840 --> 10:35.740
sunlight they needed. Okay. The story has never been finished. Some day maybe.
That's from the surface of one of the planets, looking at the other, During a

10:35.740 --> 10:49.440
partial eclipse, the shadow of the world you're on is falling on the planet
you're looking at. That's the reddish area. OK. Next one. Pretty much the same

10:49.440 --> 10:58.000
source, but it comes in the other direction, just coming out from behind. But
most of the planets you're on is now in sunlight, so we see it reflected in the

10:58.000 --> 10:59.200
ocean, so it's up here.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.000
No, check.

11:09.860 --> 11:21.300
That was another one that was never went very far. The system is V444 signal, an
equipping system of which one part is a W-7. the other is about an old three or four,

11:21.300 --> 11:34.120
Two of the hottest objects would shine. Probably
extremely young size. I had to cook up an excuse for planets there and I

11:34.120 --> 11:47.960
couldn't think of any. And finally, I decided planets, no, comets, yes. And the
comet that was found had been visited a few thousand years before, because after

11:47.960 --> 11:58.600
all, any object like that would be interesting to a space-traveling race. And
the common had been hollowed out a lot of research and equipment. And the

11:58.600 --> 12:07.720
nextspending is looking inside the common. Which as Fred Ripple says, is a tent
of ice. Now it has been sort of hollowed out, the machinery is lying there, and

12:07.720 --> 12:15.040
it's very hard to make out any details, but that's reasonable because if you are
there you are in trouble guard, making out details. Your inside ice, you're

12:15.040 --> 12:26.280
illuminated from outside, hence the greenish color, and there are tunnels and
cables and you know- I called it labyrinth, to let it go at that. I haven't seen

12:26.280 --> 12:29.780
any bodies. Okay, next one.

12:35.700 --> 12:46.480
That was when I was flipping around the vicinity of Rizzo and the ship was doing
some mining on a fairly solid metal asteroid which is condensed way in, fairly

12:46.480 --> 12:56.180
close to the star, Rigel's about 150,000 times the brightest sun if it takes 50
,000 or so, we don't know how far away it is and that far in if anything

12:56.180 --> 13:06.980
condensed as tall it was the metal so the assumption was that you uh did your
mining in the neighborhood where Rigel's prominence you could get at you if you

13:06.980 --> 13:09.780
weren't careful. OK.

13:13.920 --> 13:23.280
I think you could make a lot of stories about the life of those miners, never
mind doing any further. That was another one I did for the episode, the Apple,

13:23.500 --> 13:33.200
the one where that leftover computer that looked like a reptile was keeping
people going and defending itself. There obviously had to be another planet in

13:33.200 --> 13:43.600
the system which had another such device on it, but there's no reason for vol
being there. So this is a satellite of a Jovian-type planet further out in the

13:43.600 --> 13:52.640
system. The star is about life furious, so it had to be a video further out. The
Jovian planet had to be hot enough to keep the satellite habitable, And this is

13:52.640 --> 14:04.640
a satellite partly lightened by the star and partly lightened by the dull, red,
hot planet down to the lower right. And there's a few thousand more. Three

14:04.640 --> 14:10.420
million more square miles to write stories on. Am I anywhere near infinity yet?
Keep going.

14:15.520 --> 14:22.200
That's from the surface of one of the satellites looking at the dull, red, hot
planet, partly illuminated by

14:22.220 --> 14:24.640
the star down a triangle there.

14:26.280 --> 14:26.880
Okay.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.640
I don't see somebody near the end.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.580
Don't gotta talk to her, anyway.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.880
Oh, yeah, that's gotta be modern.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.120
The mass pertains to dinner.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.860
What's over in the middle of that hall there?

14:50.860 --> 14:51.580
Black hole.

14:52.760 --> 14:58.080
Getting close to a red dwarf star, close enough for tidal forces to go into action material being

14:58.920 --> 15:08.220
pulled out of the star falling into the black hole as it falls potential energy
showing up is kinetic so it's radiating x-rays and anything else you care to

15:08.220 --> 15:18.780
name I don't know if the black hole is actually going to hit the star and clean
it all up or not I painted the picture a little too early Some black holes are

15:18.780 --> 15:27.800
showing up in stories, and there are lots of things that can be done with them,
that haven't been done yet, especially if Hawkins fellows just decided they're

15:27.800 --> 15:39.100
not that permanent. They can lose their mask by tunneling effects. It's the laws
of quantum mechanics are true. Yeah. How many of these people work out? Not very

15:39.100 --> 15:48.840
effectively. It doesn't lend itself to verbal explanation. the reason the black
hole supposedly couldn't let anything out was that the velocity is greater than

15:48.840 --> 16:08.580
the speed of light. And even protons can't make it. Quantum mechanics is a
statistical field... Let's try. 

16:00.640 --> 16:02.460
What's the whole reason for that?

16:04.940 --> 16:09.660
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get at least with my way up to here.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.200
A radioactive material, a beta ray of matter that

16:13.200 --> 16:15.260
kicked out electrons, theoretically should.

16:15.980 --> 16:18.860
The electrons are inside, or part-op, neutrons

16:18.860 --> 16:21.740
which are inside the nucleus which is positively charged.

16:22.420 --> 16:25.660
And the attractive field that that electron

16:25.660 --> 16:30.040
would have to go out against is more than it should be able to pass.

16:31.100 --> 16:35.940
But quantum mechanics says you don't have a continuous state of affairs.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.020
This energy state is possible, this energy state is possible,

16:40.180 --> 16:41.600
this energy state is possible.

16:41.920 --> 16:46.300
Most people are familiar with this in the electron arrangement of atoms

16:46.300 --> 16:48.200
that they had in high-field chemistry of the light.

16:48.780 --> 16:51.760
Well, the same sort of thing apparently applies inside the nuclei,

16:51.940 --> 16:55.120
though I know a hell of a lot less about the energy levels

16:55.120 --> 16:56.340
that they're supposed to be there.

16:56.900 --> 17:01.880
But whether or not something will actually get through that potential barrier

17:01.860 --> 17:14.880
is a statistical matter. And it's heavy and badly designed nuclei, uranium and
radium and materials like that, this sort of stuff. And there is a possibility

17:14.880 --> 17:27.440
that a particle will find itself outside the nucleus without having actually
climbed the potential wall. And they call this phenomenon tunneling. And

17:27.440 --> 17:36.940
theoretically, if the quantum rules apply, they will also apply to black holes.
Apparently according to an article in, I think, last month's Scientific

17:36.940 --> 17:46.120
American, this disposes of the micro-black holes once and for all. If they were
formed 10 billion years ago and the Big Bang at the start of the Universe,

17:46.480 --> 17:53.880
they've radiated away by now. But the probability gets very much smaller as the
black hole gets more and more massive

17:54.320 --> 17:58.860
And a free-solar mass black hole supposedly would take something like 10 to the

17:58.860 --> 18:01.160
66th power years to radiate away.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.460
So it's a fairly permanent object.

18:04.400 --> 18:09.960
However, if you want to find some way in your story of making use of quantum effects,

18:10.540 --> 18:14.220
and God knows that's just another of the things that we've been using for fact,

18:14.220 --> 18:18.140
that light travels for years, maybe you can hop in and out now.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.040
Go ahead, you like the story.

18:28.760 --> 18:32.980
Well, whether or not the universe is all going to wind up in black holes,

18:33.760 --> 18:40.260
it still seems pretty probable that the black holes will then continue spreading apart indefinitely.

18:41.660 --> 18:44.100
And gradually, and I do mean gradually,

18:44.580 --> 18:48.880
radiate their contents away again, and what you have after that I don't know.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.440
I'll let her to hawk and see.

18:52.480 --> 18:52.820
Okay.

18:57.080 --> 19:08.760
Some stories, I'm not sure I put that in upside down and it looks like
it... Some of the paintings tell their own story! You don't have to write a

19:08.760 --> 19:19.540
story around it, but you can! This one is entitled Sub Satellite, and it's
upside down from the way I had it mind when i painted it uh and there's a

19:19.540 --> 19:28.100
wrecked ship on phobus up there and mars is in the background and a slightly
wrecked man in the foreground and the whole thing tells its own story some of

19:28.100 --> 19:37.920
the later ones are a bit better one pop on to them especially in the story they
tell i call

19:37.920 --> 19:50.800
that one communication gap Okay. One ziggle out of the audience, doesn't it?
Because he just happened to be an arthropod and figured that there was some fair

19:50.800 --> 19:59.420
chance of communicating with the highest life he could find which is also an
arthropod. The fact that he had arrived somewhere in the middle of Tambrian and

19:59.420 --> 20:17.980
he'd go, He cried. Okay. Anyone wants to write that story, go right ahead. It
doesn't project very well. The title was Omin. It's supposed to be sunrise sky,

20:18.260 --> 20:31.680
reflection in water down there and a moon hanging just between two other suns in
a ocean. But the Yeah, let's go on.

20:36.480 --> 20:47.380
Ah, again it doesn't show very well. I mean, I have it which I suspect he died
artistically, a painting, a picture in which the key elements can't be seen

20:47.380 --> 20:49.300
until you lean over and look rather closely.

20:52.560 --> 20:59.400
And the planet is the earth and down here in the rock is a fossil human thorax.

21:03.020 --> 21:09.160
Sorry it doesn't feel better. Let's see if the next one does, you can always
hope.

21:14.220 --> 21:16.540
That isn't a story, but could be.

21:17.120 --> 21:21.460
It's meant to be a scientifically-prolegged illustration of a T-towry star.

21:21.980 --> 21:29.180
A star just at the point in the contraction of the original nebula, where the hydrogen-fusing fire had lighted.

21:29.640 --> 21:33.220
And there's still a lot of gas and dust which hasn't fallen into the sun.

21:33.800 --> 21:39.980
A wildly irregular object, partly we think because the actual radiation output is still

21:39.980 --> 21:48.180
varying wildly, and partly because there's a lot of obscuring matter still
around it that's occasionally blocked the radiation. .

21:51.600 --> 22:03.540
You shouldn't be able to write a story about a plant there, but you should be
able to write a story about it. Okay, that came out of my Rigel talk for Star

22:03.540 --> 22:19.280
Trek. This is Rigel V off the background, but maybe I think it was about Rigel
14 looking at it. Okay. I'll describe Rigel 14 if you want. Just write me a

22:19.280 --> 22:28.960
note. I'll tell you how far, I think I can find my notes on how far out it was
and how many centuries a year it was, you know, that sort of stuff. Today

22:28.960 --> 22:42.640
another not-quite-sumnless-world situation, but it's the planet of a red dwarf
star which has evaporated out of the galaxy. Enough dynamic encounters, you tend

22:42.640 --> 22:58.340
to distribute kinetic energy equally among stars, just as you do among molecules
in a gas cloud, and there's a good deal of theoretical reason to suspect that there are a lot of low-mass stars and low-mass objects in the space between the galaxies.

22:58.980 --> 23:03.420
Whether there's enough to bring the universe back together again, nobody's sure.

23:03.940 --> 23:08.860
At the moment, all we know is all the stuff we know isn't enough, and it's expanding for good.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.280
Okay.

23:14.920 --> 23:19.540
I didn't change this one, and I never tried to write a story about it.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.060
The star is the binary system you set it.

23:23.840 --> 23:34.540
And one star is a blue main-shape one giant, and the other is an F-yellow, so much hotter than the sun.

23:34.540 --> 23:45.600
Not quite super-giant about luminosity class two, and presumably, judging by the fact that some of these data are close enough together to be carrying math out of each other,

23:46.000 --> 23:51.980
and what that would do to any planet they may have, enjoy yourself. I'm not gonna bother with it.
Okay.

23:57.980 --> 24:08.600
Leda Lyre has been used repeatedly. That's the Dickson painting, I think. And if
anyone has read Larry Nivens' soft weapon, they'd gotten the verbal description.

24:08.640 --> 24:16.820
Actually he went by Bonacel's painting, but it doesn't matter. The paintings
look alike. The only catch is that the brighter of those stars of the P-type

24:16.820 --> 24:27.320
main sequence star, about three times as hot as the sun. The other object we
don't know is the product to be an f-type star. I've read the one paper in which

24:27.320 --> 24:37.280
they thought it might be a black hole, which is, of course, after black holes
got popular. And the spectral evidence suggests that you've got this spiral of

24:37.280 --> 24:46.300
gas being ejected from one star, pulled towards the other, but orbital motion is
so fast that some of it misses and goes spiraling merrily out of the distance.

24:46.300 --> 24:55.080
The one shot effects the same thing as descending the Pioneer 10 out of the
solar system. The only chart in the picture is you couldn't begin to look in

24:55.080 --> 25:06.860
that direction with a star of that temperature in front of you and you would
never see that red hydrogen spiral. No way. It's not bright enough. However, it

25:06.860 --> 25:10.460
makes a nice painting and it made a nice story. Next one.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.240
The name's gonna keep on over.

25:21.180 --> 25:28.340
The blue-white star is the one that's exploded and now is shrinking rapidly down to the white dwarf or neutron star,

25:28.420 --> 25:31.960
or a black hole, depending on what its mass is, as it's specified.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.660
Part of the binary system, the other star is the red giant.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.240
We'll go the same way in another 30 years or so.

25:38.540 --> 25:49.740
The planets in the foreground apparently got well
posted during the explosion. Next. Can I ask you quickly to remind the mind that

25:49.740 --> 25:58.980
the Mars is a moment of reflection the air sun ? Probably not. Well, it's a
little matter away from it, but not all of it. And that's Algol, the demon star,

25:59.120 --> 26:06.600
the blinder, this is a different painting. More or less correct, although the
blurb has with it wasn't because he had the dimensions way off.

26:20.820 --> 26:30.320
And I did a little bit of thinking about a planet for that system one time, and
you can have this one free, I'll describe the planet for you, but the next

26:30.320 --> 26:40.380
picture is a thing on it. He called it the third star. I had to put it a little
too far out as to be kept at a comfortable temperature by algol if it were a

26:40.380 --> 26:52.620
black body. If it had been far enough in, the third star would have ruined its
orbit. So, I decided, okay, let's greenhouse it up to a decent temperature. So,

26:52.680 --> 27:03.260
it's got a nice, shallow cloud envelope like Venus. And its natives are just
getting to the stage where they are being scientists. And this group has gotten

27:03.260 --> 27:13.620
above the cloud layer of the four creatures are completely unused upon life and
Aldo ame is partly an Eclipse, and they're in trouble with it comes out from

27:13.620 --> 27:23.620
Eclipse before very long. The cave star is there and the other one's hidden
behind the cumulus top, because unlike inteed and some other artists who can

27:23.620 --> 27:32.620
call themselves artists, I let my scientific prejudices this is affect my
artistic license. I don't paint a picture of what you're looking straight at a B

27:32.620 --> 27:42.520
-type star. You know, damn well you couldn't see it or you couldn't see anything
else. So I hid the B-star behind its companion and I hid the other star whose

27:42.520 --> 27:52.320
type I don't know but which I'm sure is too hot to look at straight, behind a
cloud. That's me, I mean with artistic license you can do this things. I'm a

27:52.320 --> 28:02.520
scientists not an artist, sorry about that. OK, but if you want that planet, go
right ahead. All sorts of things you can do with it, but people look a little

28:02.520 --> 28:15.900
like centipede. They evolved in shallow oceans and tidal regions, with very
heavy weed beds, and their centipede structure involved climbing and moving

28:15.900 --> 28:25.800
around, but tides went up and down. and they were sometimes in the air and
sometimes not. And the general... rugged environment was what selected for

28:25.800 --> 28:36.160
intelligence there. I used the same thing in the Stellar 2 story, stuck with it,
but it was a different planet. And that, I think the last of the slides but

28:36.160 --> 28:47.980
remember Jim Blish decided that Mr. Spock's Homeworld Vulcan was a planet of 40
Arradane? Well, I went along with this. I mean, I'm stuck with it, has appeared

28:47.980 --> 29:02.220
in books. Hordea is a triple star. The main body of the system is about a K3
about 30% as bright as the sun, and I decided that that's where the Vulcan had

29:02.220 --> 29:11.500
better be succed. Certainly closer in, because Vulcan has been stated to be
hotter than the Earth, and therefore it has a shorter year whether Jim was

29:11.500 --> 29:18.220
willing to admit it or not. The other two stars are rather interesting here the
brighter one is a white dwarf
