WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:07.760
We use some of James Gunn's material too from that movie things he has from his Kansas,

00:07.980 --> 00:13.020
what is it that, oh I forget what it is, he's got a center there for science studies.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.540
Yeah, I know he did, sorry what Williamson did, gave his collection to the university,

00:16.800 --> 00:19.320
it served as a nucleus for a, and then.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.040
Yeah, he rent some of their little half hour things.

00:21.360 --> 00:21.760
I need you.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.240
Testing one, two, testing.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.940
For the class, I mean not for the show obviously.

00:26.660 --> 00:31.760
Yeah, he's, yeah I understand he has a whole bunch of them, I think I did one years ago,

00:31.840 --> 00:34.400
just a five minute spot type thing.

00:36.380 --> 00:36.780
Right.

00:40.380 --> 00:41.320
Okay, good.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.720
Good advice for it.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.700
It would help you if I took this up on the sheriff with that over there.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.040
No, that's fine, that's fine.

00:54.040 --> 00:54.800
We're doing fine, you know.

00:57.280 --> 01:01.020
Our studio, your office is very neat compared to our studio.

01:02.660 --> 01:08.160
I clean it about once a year, you know, we have a cleaning lady comes in here periodically,

01:08.280 --> 01:10.840
but I never let her in my office, keeping the rest of the house,

01:11.060 --> 01:12.660
she cleans it and I'll be able to find anything.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.160
You're the same with me.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.780
Daryl, you want to go ahead and lead off?

01:16.620 --> 01:18.220
Yeah, David, can you, yeah, start with?

01:18.420 --> 01:18.740
No, go ahead.

01:19.040 --> 01:19.180
Okay.

01:21.260 --> 01:25.780
Mr. Zalazny, first of all, we'd like to talk a little bit about your origins as a science fiction writer.

01:26.740 --> 01:32.740
When you began writing, did you plan on being a science fiction writer or had you considered mainstream writing?

01:33.880 --> 01:34.960
Well, it's a funny thing.

01:35.320 --> 01:44.520
I was originally a reader of science fiction from about the age of eleven on through high school,

01:44.520 --> 01:47.520
and during that period I did write a lot of science fiction stories,

01:47.520 --> 01:50.300
which I tried to sell, but I was like my early teens,

01:50.680 --> 01:55.580
and I didn't really meet with any success at that point,

01:56.820 --> 02:01.860
and I decided actually before that that I'd wanted to be a writer.

02:02.500 --> 02:07.800
I wasn't, it wasn't necessarily science fiction that I had in mind,

02:07.800 --> 02:11.200
though it was science fiction stories that I was writing during the period I was reading them.

02:11.820 --> 02:14.280
When I went to college, I stopped reading science fiction,

02:14.280 --> 02:18.540
just concentrate on the material I had there, and I wrote poetry actually, exclusively.

02:19.900 --> 02:24.980
I decided that I was going to start writing again as soon as I got out of college and had some time,

02:25.800 --> 02:30.320
and at that point I wasn't absolutely certain what it was that I would try writing,

02:30.860 --> 02:35.600
but when the opportunity finally presented itself in early 1962,

02:37.920 --> 02:44.080
I decided it might be easier for me to break into science fiction

02:44.080 --> 02:48.500
since I had read so much of it in the past, knew the area,

02:48.660 --> 02:54.420
so I decided I'd try there first, and I went out and re-familiarized myself with science fiction,

02:56.320 --> 02:59.420
and then I began writing and submitting the stories,

02:59.580 --> 03:03.380
and after about six or seven weeks I sold my first one,

03:03.380 --> 03:09.440
and I sold 16 others that year, so I stayed with it,

03:09.580 --> 03:16.600
and that was, it's been over 18 years now,

03:17.260 --> 03:21.680
so that's how I got in it.

03:22.380 --> 03:23.300
I'm happy I did.

03:24.060 --> 03:29.400
If I had an idea for what I thought was a nice story or something,

03:29.580 --> 03:32.300
that was not science fiction, I wouldn't hesitate to write it,

03:32.300 --> 03:38.300
but I've gotten a certain habit of mine from it over the years,

03:38.540 --> 03:42.900
so that usually I do tend to translate everything into science fiction.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.540
Have you written any mainstream material at all that's been published?

03:49.680 --> 03:51.800
I have had a book of poetry published,

03:53.280 --> 03:59.200
but that's really the only non-science fiction material I've had.

04:00.680 --> 04:04.460
In other words, you did make a conscious decision to become a writer,

04:05.180 --> 04:07.940
and show science fiction as the genre of the form that you wrote.

04:07.940 --> 04:11.200
The decision to be a writer came first a long time ago,

04:11.320 --> 04:15.200
and science fiction was the point of attack for selling,

04:15.580 --> 04:19.460
and so they were in a way two separate decisions,

04:19.580 --> 04:20.960
but yeah, it was a conscious decision.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.920
One more question I have on your origins.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.080
What in your background, say your college background,

04:31.120 --> 04:34.940
or your interests or anything, would have influenced the kind of science fiction you write?

04:35.040 --> 04:39.080
Were there any particular studies or areas that you were interested in

04:39.080 --> 04:44.360
that maybe formed your style or your ideas the way you approached the writing of science fiction?

04:46.560 --> 04:48.320
Oh, that's a really difficult one.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.300
I don't know.

04:50.300 --> 04:59.040
See, my intention was to take a graduate degree and teach while writing on the side.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.420
As things fell out, I wound up with a government job,

05:03.740 --> 05:06.880
and never did use my graduate degree,

05:07.100 --> 05:10.000
but as an undergraduate, I was a psychology major,

05:11.080 --> 05:15.600
and I decided I did not really want to work as a psychologist,

05:15.600 --> 05:19.460
and it occurred to me somewhere along the line that if I'm,

05:19.480 --> 05:26.400
we're simply going to be teaching and writing with the aim in mind of eventually writing full time,

05:26.540 --> 05:30.460
I might as well teach something that would be a little more fun than psychology,

05:30.480 --> 05:37.120
so I switched to English and took my graduate work in English and comparative literature.

05:38.920 --> 05:43.480
There were a number of science courses as electives and so forth.

05:44.700 --> 05:52.420
I have read an awful lot in the sciences, both during and since college.

05:55.520 --> 06:04.860
I don't really know what particular area might have influenced my habits of mind that much.

06:06.980 --> 06:09.740
I read fairly widely.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.580
As I said, it's difficult questions, hard to say.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.520
I was thinking specifically, say your comparative literature background.

06:18.740 --> 06:25.240
Is that where you, oh, I guess get your background in mythology, legend, or that sort of.

06:25.240 --> 06:30.200
Well, my thesis was actually a thing involving the Elizabethan Jack of Ian theater,

06:30.200 --> 06:35.420
but I had always, I read mythology before I read science fiction.

06:35.780 --> 06:42.100
Back before I started reading science fiction when I was 11, I didn't discover it until that point.

06:42.240 --> 06:50.560
Before then, I had always liked things of a rather fabulous nature, so I read a lot of mythology,

06:50.800 --> 06:52.800
and I never stopped reading it.

06:52.800 --> 07:01.340
As I grew older, my tastes got a little more sophisticated and became a little more interested

07:01.340 --> 07:03.640
in the backgrounds and origins of these things.

07:03.800 --> 07:09.940
I went into comparative religions and anthropology just as a personal interest.

07:10.480 --> 07:16.280
This wasn't really the subject of any academic pursuit, per se.

07:17.800 --> 07:22.380
When you first started, or at least about the time that you first started writing science fiction,

07:22.480 --> 07:30.160
or at least getting it published, was the same time that New Style of Writing was becoming predominant, the New Wave.

07:32.780 --> 07:39.460
In some of our talks with other science fiction writers, they've named you as one of the people in the vanguard of the New Wave.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.560
What is your reaction to the New Wave style of writing and how it came about?

07:47.380 --> 07:55.580
Well, it's a different thing when you're right there, because when I began in the early 60s,

07:55.600 --> 08:02.780
I wasn't consciously attempting to react against anything that had gone before.

08:04.320 --> 08:14.360
My virtual hindsight now, the New Wave probably is best defined as a kind of reaction to the earlier science fiction story,

08:14.400 --> 08:25.380
where there was less emphasis on characterization, where the writing was a fairly nuts and bolts type prose,

08:25.380 --> 08:31.360
where stream of consciousness was something that was never used.

08:32.520 --> 08:40.240
All of the impressionistic and expressionistic writing tricks that appeared in, say, Michael Morcox's New Worlds,

08:41.060 --> 08:49.720
or some of the things some of the writers, such as Delaney and Dish, were doing, who came on the scene at about the same time.

08:49.720 --> 09:07.580
To me, none of this was invoked as a kind of reaction to the hard science story, or the extrapolative story.

09:10.740 --> 09:17.220
Looking back on it now, I was simply telling the only story I knew how to tell at that time,

09:17.380 --> 09:22.240
and I wasn't thinking of it in context in terms of the other things that were going on.

09:22.380 --> 09:32.300
I was just purely exercising tunnel vision and writing this sort of story I felt I was able to write.

09:33.300 --> 09:43.620
I suppose, having grown up on the earlier sort of science fiction, the space opera sort of thing of the 30s and 40s too,

09:43.700 --> 09:51.060
and the harder science stories of the 40s and some of the sociological science fiction of the 50s,

09:51.700 --> 09:59.880
and having a background in literature, there's a natural tendency,

09:59.880 --> 10:05.240
whether it's conscious or not, to want to do something different than the things that had gone before.

10:10.440 --> 10:20.420
Also, just a personal idiosyncrasy, in longer pieces of writing, I tend to think of this thing in terms of character usually.

10:23.540 --> 10:29.500
Normally, I get the idea for the characters before I work out a plot, or even conceive of the setting.

10:32.760 --> 10:37.620
As a consequence, my stories, well the first ones were basically gimmick stories,

10:38.320 --> 10:43.600
because it was the easiest way to break in, it was about all that I was capable of doing at the time,

10:43.660 --> 10:47.980
but when I began writing at greater length and when I was a bit sure of myself,

10:48.640 --> 10:55.990
I would think of the characters first, so the stories tended to have more, I suppose, in the way of psychological motivation,

10:56.740 --> 11:07.700
rather than just external characterization, and my writing itself, possibly because of the years I spent writing poetry

11:07.700 --> 11:21.400
and reading general literature tended to be a bit different from some of the earlier things which were kind of journalistic in character,

11:25.540 --> 11:34.960
but I wasn't really aware of this at the time, and there was no conscious revolt against things which had gone before.

11:36.040 --> 11:45.040
It was just a new type of story which was being written at the time, which by virtue of redundant, I'll take this out.

11:49.060 --> 11:58.720
Well, it's kind of funny too, because I think the first story for which I became known was a piece called Rose for Ecclesiastes,

12:03.060 --> 12:10.480
and one of my reasons in writing this is because I was very fond of the earlier space operas and things like this,

12:10.560 --> 12:23.560
where they played John Carter of Mars, and I had always wanted to do something set on the Mars, which existed in these earlier stories,

12:23.560 --> 12:28.520
and I knew at the time I wrote it that it was scientifically impossible at that point.

12:28.640 --> 12:34.980
We already knew enough about Mars to know that the temperature was not the same as I had it in the story,

12:35.060 --> 12:41.320
that the atmosphere was not the same and so forth, but it was close enough to the point where this knowledge was just becoming current,

12:41.780 --> 12:49.560
that I could still get away with doing a thing like that, so I intentionally wrote that and wrote it in the fashion I did.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.820
I always kind of exercised a nostalgia on my part.

12:54.940 --> 13:03.000
I always wanted to do a story set on that kind of Mars, and I knew that if I waited another year or so,

13:03.020 --> 13:03.820
I wouldn't be able to.

13:04.860 --> 13:09.620
The same with Venus for my story, the doors of his face, the lamps of his mouth.

13:10.140 --> 13:15.400
At that point, we already were aware that the surface temperature was about 900 degrees,

13:15.400 --> 13:21.380
but still there was this whole traditional body of science fiction literature,

13:21.540 --> 13:31.360
which had a vast, watery world, misty and so forth, that I really had wanted to use at least once in my life,

13:31.400 --> 13:34.880
so I did those two stories as a kind of tribute to the earlier things.

13:36.500 --> 13:42.760
But then again, I wrote them the way I was writing them, rather than in the older style,

13:43.020 --> 13:48.660
so that they, reading them now, they'd have to be regarded as fantasy rather than science fiction,

13:48.800 --> 13:54.640
because science has already demonstrated that those circumstances don't prevail.

14:00.780 --> 14:07.660
So in a sense, I'm a traditionalist, or at least I'm very fond of the traditions science fiction possesses.

14:09.500 --> 14:14.400
On the other hand, I like to think of myself as a realist, and I do make a distinction,

14:14.540 --> 14:19.100
which I hope my readers make between the pieces I'm writing, which have a fantasy basis,

14:19.100 --> 14:25.340
and the ones I'm writing which are nearer the science fiction side of the spectrum.

14:27.200 --> 14:33.960
I was going to ask if you yourself recognized a dual type of style in your writing.

14:34.200 --> 14:40.340
I've noticed, it seems, some stories that are more of a fantasy and new wave, if you will, nature,

14:40.800 --> 14:42.800
and some that are more of a science fictional nature.

14:43.700 --> 14:49.240
Oh yeah, I do make a distinction myself.

14:49.940 --> 14:57.000
In a science fiction story, everything I feel should be explainable in terms of natural laws,

14:57.180 --> 15:01.000
or extensions of natural laws, as we understand them now.

15:02.100 --> 15:07.040
Whereas in a fantasy story, it's part of the rules of the game,

15:07.040 --> 15:12.580
so I feel there are no compunctions against invoking the supernatural, or bringing in magic,

15:12.820 --> 15:14.900
and things of that sort.

15:18.460 --> 15:23.540
So basically a science fiction story, things are ultimately explainable in a fantasy story.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.560
They're explainable really in terms of something that isn't explainable.

15:28.560 --> 15:39.960
So you've got more of the less rational background, if you push things far enough in a fantasy story.

15:41.440 --> 15:46.980
As long as we're on that topic, maybe we can talk a little bit about one of your books that we admire very much,

15:47.180 --> 15:51.980
The Jack of Shadows. How would you classify that, fantasy or science fiction?

15:51.980 --> 15:56.900
I would have to call it science fantasy really.

15:59.240 --> 16:06.040
I supposed to extend my answer to the previous question, but further, I also believe in mixing the two.

16:09.300 --> 16:15.320
Well, Lord of Light for instance, was a book where I intentionally wrote it to be taken two ways of fantasy.

16:15.320 --> 16:26.140
A fantasy fan could read it as a piece of fantasy, whereas a science fiction fan also had options available to him.

16:26.380 --> 16:35.140
Any single item which occurs in there, which is of an unusual nature, is that there's ultimately an explanation available for it,

16:35.140 --> 16:38.980
if the person cares to use it. If he doesn't, that's fine too.

16:38.980 --> 16:46.880
I also tried to write that book in something more of a fantasy style. The sentences are longer and a bit more convoluted.

16:49.260 --> 16:53.740
There's more figurative language in that book than in some of my others.

16:54.760 --> 17:03.360
With Jack of Shadows, I did intentionally want to try to marry a fantasy idea and a science fiction idea.

17:07.200 --> 17:12.660
I will do such things again if it occurs to me.

17:14.340 --> 17:19.780
It's the same thing in changeling too, the mixture there of science and magic.

17:20.800 --> 17:31.420
Yes, of course there I used the out of the parallel world of course, but still that's the case.

17:33.320 --> 17:45.660
In Jack of Shadows, when the story changes from that of the fantasy world to the abrupt change to that of the highly technological side of the world,

17:46.540 --> 17:53.100
when I was reading that it was almost as if somebody spliced down the middle of the book and all of a sudden here's a different book.

17:53.100 --> 18:00.920
It was a marvelous device used to change the reference point of the person who was reading.

18:02.420 --> 18:03.200
Thank you.

18:06.880 --> 18:15.480
Obviously you did that intentionally, but I really think my question up here.

18:18.600 --> 18:24.540
Was that just kind of a fun writer's trick to do because you knew the person was going to be reading along there and all of a sudden hit this certain portion?

18:26.340 --> 18:28.080
Well, yes, it was fun.

18:29.600 --> 18:37.640
I suppose, yeah, the first thing I thought of when I had the idea for that book actually was an image of that world,

18:38.840 --> 18:42.380
half in light and half in darkness and then the character.

18:44.660 --> 18:49.880
And for a long time I just thought about the character and the plot pretty much unfolded itself.

18:52.780 --> 18:54.540
I have a question on Jack of Shadows too.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.180
I'm not sure how you react to these.

18:57.920 --> 19:02.560
Most authors that I've spoken with are read when they're writing about their own work.

19:02.620 --> 19:08.900
I kind of reluctant to talk about what they mean by something, you know, in terms of theme or intention and so forth.

19:10.740 --> 19:16.920
My question was going to be, oh, I noticed in many of your works you deal with opposites.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I guess a writer can't help, you know, light, dark, science, magic and so forth.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.500
In a lot of cases I think you talk about reconciliation.

19:24.080 --> 19:36.800
Now in the Jack of Shadows, when Jack allows his soul to enter him and he's destroyed the machine at the center of the world which keeps the world from spinning.

19:36.800 --> 19:41.880
Are you saying that science and magic need to be reconciled?

19:42.640 --> 19:43.800
That they can be, they should be.

19:44.020 --> 19:45.960
Or is that just a device to hang a story on?

19:50.660 --> 19:58.840
I did look at it as a kind of reconciliation, not necessarily between science and magic per se,

19:58.840 --> 20:08.100
but science and magic themselves almost being taken as symbolic of the light and the dark and everything.

20:08.420 --> 20:12.020
I mean magic not necessarily have to be magic.

20:12.020 --> 20:22.840
It can represent the dark side of the human mind, the unconscious and so forth as opposed to the rational, logical...

20:26.620 --> 20:30.880
I'll go that far and say, looking at reconciliation there.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.800
And one more question on the end of that book at the end.

20:35.480 --> 20:43.400
When Morningstar reaches down for Jack, I'm certain you meant that to be for a reader to take that however he wanted to.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.000
Is he going to catch Jack and so forth?

20:45.440 --> 20:49.480
I took it as that Jack is now in some sense a whole man.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.360
He's reconciled light and dark, he's gotten his soul.

20:53.320 --> 20:57.040
And Morningstar would be sort of the beginning of a new day, the Morningstar.

20:57.540 --> 21:00.740
But there's a reconciliation, he's going to be saying that Morningstar will catch him.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.240
Would that be a misreading?

21:02.660 --> 21:02.900
No.

21:07.420 --> 21:12.200
I've noticed, you mentioned earlier about how you enjoyed reading mythology.

21:12.200 --> 21:16.460
And you do seem to incorporate a lot of mythology in your work.

21:17.380 --> 21:26.440
Or at least some of it seems to appear pseudo mythology and some of it follows traditional mythology.

21:26.440 --> 21:26.900
Yeah.

21:32.120 --> 21:43.480
I did that more in my earlier writings than I did in recent years because there came a point

21:46.800 --> 21:51.560
where whenever I would attend a science fiction convention or any sort of get together,

21:51.560 --> 21:56.560
I'd usually be asked to appear on a panel with a title like mythology and science fiction.

21:57.560 --> 22:04.680
And I started to feel at that point that I was being typecast as a writer of mythological science fiction.

22:04.860 --> 22:11.720
So I intentionally abandoned it for a time and wrote things such as Doorways in the Sand.

22:11.720 --> 22:21.560
And today we choose faces which do not really contain any overt references to specific mythologies.

22:23.020 --> 22:26.180
This is not to say that I have abandoned it entirely.

22:27.280 --> 22:31.840
I did want to get away from it for a time though to show that I could write other sorts of things.

22:36.160 --> 22:43.020
Now that I have done so, I doubt let's go back and try a few more things using mythology,

22:43.120 --> 22:48.740
perhaps in a different fashion than I have in the past, or some combination of mythology and something else.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.760
Because I do have a certain fondness for this sort of material.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.640
You mentioned the Lord of Light a little bit earlier.

22:56.680 --> 23:00.060
I'm not that familiar with the Hindu or Buddhist mythology.

23:00.060 --> 23:07.600
Was that a retelling of a Hindu myth or did you simply use the names and the structure and put your own details into it?

23:08.620 --> 23:09.700
Both in a way.

23:10.040 --> 23:18.000
There are bits and pieces and excerpts there from a great number of different elements in Hinduism.

23:21.460 --> 23:29.140
Religion is one of these vast bodies of material where they, in a way, never really discarded anything.

23:29.340 --> 23:35.240
Just kept adding so that it grew to quite sizable proportions over the centuries.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.540
So that it's kind of a vast mine of materials.

23:38.880 --> 23:44.160
I took the elements that were most suitable for the story I wanted to tell.

23:45.160 --> 23:58.920
However, I did use the historical instance there of the situation involving the development of Buddhism itself as a reaction,

23:59.340 --> 24:03.960
really to the earlier religion of the Brahmins,

24:03.960 --> 24:17.400
and thought that it would be interesting to, in a way, follow that course by having my character who intended to rebel against the situation

24:17.400 --> 24:28.400
similar to that in old India, do so by similar means by setting up Buddhism as a reaction to it.

24:28.400 --> 24:34.920
So there's that element and then the various trappings of the stories themselves do have their sources,

24:34.960 --> 24:42.660
but there is no one consecutive linear narrative that parallels Lord of Light, in that sense.

24:44.420 --> 24:50.240
Would you consider yourself a fan of pure fantasy like the works of Tolkien and so forth?

24:50.780 --> 24:58.700
Oh yes, I read both. It varies from day to day what my mood is, what I most like.

24:59.160 --> 25:03.780
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I like fantasy, and Thursdays, Thursdays and Saturdays science fiction.

25:04.780 --> 25:08.620
Sundays a day of rest, but no, I read both. I like both.

25:13.900 --> 25:17.680
My own reading pleasure, it doesn't matter that much.

25:21.040 --> 25:25.260
Let's talk about Amber for a while. We're all great fans of your Amber series too.

25:26.740 --> 25:31.920
I wonder, first of all, how you got involved in such an extended narrative.

25:32.180 --> 25:37.100
Was that in terms of a serialization of it that kept going, or was it something you'd planned to be five volumes from the start?

25:37.760 --> 25:41.000
Well, no, I had no idea how long it was going to be when I started it.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.220
I didn't even know what the story was about when I started it.

25:43.500 --> 25:50.980
I have two ways of composing a book. One is when I'm in a hurry, I will outline and follow it.

25:51.040 --> 25:56.520
I can write fairly quickly. I never follow an outline point for point. I always depart from it,

25:56.520 --> 25:58.540
but if I have an outline I can proceed pretty quickly.

25:58.540 --> 26:02.760
The other method is when I have more time on my hands,

26:03.900 --> 26:10.980
I am willing to start writing a story with a main character and a couple incidents in mind,

26:11.660 --> 26:14.080
with about 10 or 15% of a story.

26:15.700 --> 26:20.320
Nine Princes and Amber was such a thing. I thought of Corwin, I thought of that opening situation,

26:20.940 --> 26:26.140
and I thought I won't go any further in working it out. I'll just start writing.

26:26.140 --> 26:32.080
The story really told itself for about the first quarter or third of the book

26:34.080 --> 26:37.920
before I reached a point where I asked myself where I was going.

26:39.400 --> 26:46.480
At that point I had enough material from what had gone before so that I could push the book along farther.

26:46.780 --> 26:51.160
I realized somewhere after that that it was going to have to be more than one book.

26:51.160 --> 26:59.440
The economics of the situation in those days were that a writer would be better off financially doing

27:00.180 --> 27:04.480
several shorter books than one long one, just in terms of the advances and so forth.

27:04.860 --> 27:12.460
I ended Nine Princes and Amber where I did and immediately began work on the second book

27:12.460 --> 27:16.580
for which I did not have a title at that point. I wrote about a quarter of it before I stopped

27:16.580 --> 27:21.960
and went on and wrote other things. I sold Nine Princes and Amber and it wasn't until a few years later

27:21.960 --> 27:28.880
when I needed another book to fulfill an open contract with Double Day that I took the quarter of the second book

27:28.880 --> 27:36.300
I had written, sat down, thought about it more carefully, saw that it was going to have to be more than just a second book,

27:37.460 --> 27:49.020
wrote it, sent it in. At that point I had more in the way of an idea as to where the total action was headed

27:49.020 --> 27:57.820
but I still did not know how many books would be involved. I thought at some points that I might be able to wind it up

27:57.820 --> 28:01.100
as a trilogy than at others I saw half a dozen or so.

28:01.940 --> 28:09.960
I'd even toyed with the idea of telling it from different characters' points of view rather than just following Corwin.

28:10.480 --> 28:18.960
I was going to try a sort of Alexandria quartet thing where I told the same story over several times

28:18.960 --> 28:24.220
but colored by various characters' points of view and only advancing it slightly.

28:26.420 --> 28:32.120
For that sort of story though it didn't seem the best thing and the only thing that survived of that in the series itself

28:32.120 --> 28:38.520
was the automobile accident to which I kept returning and re-explaining and redefining as more things came to light.

28:41.760 --> 28:47.100
When I finished the third book I still, I thought possibly I could wind it up in four

28:51.200 --> 28:53.820
but obviously as you've read them it took five.

28:57.280 --> 29:06.100
So that was one of the books, a sort of called a free association novel as opposed to an outlined novel.

29:06.620 --> 29:10.060
Is it finished at five or is there possibly a sixth one on the horizon?

29:10.820 --> 29:15.380
There is possibly a sixth one. I have made no commitments. I do not have a plot

29:15.380 --> 29:20.800
but I've been talking about it and thinking about it publisher.

29:23.620 --> 29:29.740
It is possible when I get a few things out of the way that I'm writing now that I might go on into a sixth one.

29:31.420 --> 29:37.380
But so far as the five books that now exist are concerned, that story is told.

29:37.380 --> 29:46.040
That was the story I had in mind. Anything which would continue the series would probably take off in a new direction.

29:46.140 --> 29:48.580
It could possibly be from another character's point of view.

29:53.020 --> 29:57.260
As I said I don't have a story in mind so I won't speculate myself.

29:58.620 --> 30:06.840
I felt like there were still a few unanswered questions particularly in terms of the patterns that were now conflicting.

30:06.840 --> 30:10.840
Do I understand that correctly that the original pattern was reconstructed?

30:12.140 --> 30:13.200
So there are now two patterns.

30:14.340 --> 30:18.720
Side by side and we don't know what the interference or compatibility of those are.

30:19.220 --> 30:19.420
Right.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.820
That's what made me think there might possibly be another one on the future.

30:24.720 --> 30:29.960
Hang on here we might do a little explanation on those patterns. Some of the people might not know what that means.

30:33.800 --> 30:38.340
Could you explain a little bit about what the patterns are that they walk in amber?

30:39.980 --> 30:43.560
There are kind of central images to this series of books.

30:44.680 --> 30:52.580
It is a kind of archetypal design which exists in the real world.

30:52.580 --> 31:02.820
Amber of which our own earth and a great variety of shadings and variations thereof exist.

31:04.820 --> 31:09.300
Amber is the real world earth and the others are referred to as shadow.

31:09.700 --> 31:16.820
Our shadow in the story is the background, the basis of reality.

31:16.820 --> 31:26.980
In amber is this design called the pattern which was inscribed by an ancestor of the clan.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.860
About whom the story is told.

31:31.680 --> 31:39.640
Only a person of the blood of the royal family of amber is able to walk this pattern and not be destroyed by it.

31:39.640 --> 31:46.560
In the course of walking the pattern at some point in his early life,

31:49.260 --> 32:03.640
amberite acquires the ability to walk through the various shadow worlds which surround amber so that he can travel through an infinity of possibilities to virtually any world he desires.

32:05.380 --> 32:13.640
If the pattern itself were destroyed it would in a sense be the end of the world.

32:16.520 --> 32:21.960
This does figure in the narrative itself.

32:26.500 --> 32:29.560
In a sense that is a heroic fantasy in some ways.

32:29.560 --> 32:34.720
Isn't it Corwin is swordsman, he's fighting for the throne, magic works.

32:35.100 --> 32:37.900
It's in the tradition of heroic fantasy.

32:38.180 --> 32:46.180
Yes, I would say whenever I try anything of this sort I try to give it an extra twist is what it is.

32:46.360 --> 32:56.600
Basically I look at it myself as a kind of heroic fantasy with a few variations that don't usually occur in that sort of literature.

32:59.580 --> 33:05.060
Do you have a large fan following that keeps you going on some of these projects?

33:05.860 --> 33:24.960
Oh I do get letters saying whether they liked or disliked something came out and asking what I have coming out and what I might be engaged in writing at the moment and yeah there are a number of people who...

33:24.960 --> 33:26.720
What's the reaction to amber been from readers?

33:27.220 --> 33:31.540
I have gotten more fan letters on the amber books than anything else I have ever written.

33:33.900 --> 33:38.980
There was a period of a couple of years there where I was getting several letters a week on the amber books.

33:39.700 --> 33:44.080
So they sold well too in other words the publishers would be interested in a continuation perhaps for that reason.

33:44.080 --> 33:55.820
Yeah, about a million copies of all five amber books and a great number of foreign editions too.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.660
Can you use some more amber?

34:06.180 --> 34:07.020
Nope.

34:14.800 --> 34:15.980
We like it.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.960
We have about eight minutes tape on there maybe.

34:19.840 --> 34:20.940
You got a whole box full.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.200
No, we have time to take weeks in here all day.

34:24.020 --> 34:24.820
We won't.

34:27.240 --> 34:33.840
If that's enough on amber I had another book that I enjoyed very much is This Immortal.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.620
Was that called Call Me Conrad?

34:36.620 --> 34:46.200
Yes, that was my first novel and Call Me Conrad was my title and the title under which it appeared in when it was originally serialized in magazine of fantasy and science fiction.

34:46.560 --> 34:53.080
And it was that shorter version of it which received the Hugo that following year.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.140
And when it was sold to Ace, they're the ones who applied the shorter title.

35:01.140 --> 35:08.360
They like pithy things which are obviously identified as science fiction or fantasy.

35:08.880 --> 35:13.200
Was that your most extensive use of Greek myth as a background?

35:14.360 --> 35:14.680
Yes.

35:16.380 --> 35:20.020
I wondered how much you'd molded that on the Greeks.

35:20.200 --> 35:26.360
For instance, Conrad himself, I'm not sure I'm saying this word correctly, but was the Call of Conzoroy?

35:27.180 --> 35:28.060
Oh, yeah.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.200
Was that an actual?

35:29.200 --> 35:30.200
Call of Conzoroy.

35:31.040 --> 35:51.660
This is a kind of survival of Pan and the Sator figures which I first encountered actually in the early writings of Lawrence Dural.

35:51.660 --> 35:57.580
He travels in the Greek Isles in the Prospero's cell and reflections on a marine Venus.

35:58.540 --> 36:09.420
He was referring to the various peasant superstitions and what have you which still exists in the Greek Isles in the 30s when he was living there.

36:10.200 --> 36:15.980
And the Call of Conzoroy's figure cropped up and went into a bit of an explanation.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.320
And that sort of remained with me.

36:20.080 --> 36:26.000
And when I wrote this book, it just occurred to me as might be appropriate.

36:28.660 --> 36:31.200
I wondered why you'd use that particular figure though.

36:32.240 --> 36:35.440
Conrad seems to be sort of the savior of us if you want to put it that way.

36:35.460 --> 36:39.580
In fact, he gets sort of the administrative of it at the end of the book.

36:39.900 --> 36:43.180
And he works to retain the history and the past of Earth.

36:43.180 --> 36:47.660
I wondered why that figure would be appropriate for such a function.

36:48.900 --> 36:52.180
I mean, more of a godlike figure to me would seem to be more...

36:54.960 --> 37:01.920
Well, I sense that that figure though is a survival from a much earlier time.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.520
And so is he.

37:06.820 --> 37:08.140
It is...

37:08.670 --> 37:14.960
There is also a Dionysiac element in Conrad which this represents.

37:16.500 --> 37:19.920
He is not a completely...

37:20.600 --> 37:23.360
Might as well go ahead and keep using Nietzsche's terminology.

37:23.780 --> 37:25.820
Not completely an Apollonian figure.

37:25.960 --> 37:31.320
He had been a revolutionary at one point.

37:32.640 --> 37:39.060
While he's preserving the Earth now, there had been a point when he had been blowing up cities and assassinating people.

37:40.740 --> 37:47.740
He is intended to be a complex character with both these elements in him.

37:48.320 --> 37:54.320
At this moment in his life, he is having a role forced upon him.

37:54.320 --> 37:58.320
Or he is ultimately going to be the rational...

38:00.520 --> 38:02.340
The figure representing order.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.200
But he had not always been so.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.380
And the Galakanzaros, let's see...

38:07.800 --> 38:13.020
Representative of the other part of his personality, which we first meet him.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.560
I don't know if that completely answers your question, but...

38:18.260 --> 38:19.060
I have one more question.

38:20.440 --> 38:22.760
I was just a little uncertain about his origins.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.160
At one point I thought that he had originated...

38:25.860 --> 38:29.380
He had been left on a hillside, had a clubfoot like Oedipus in some ways.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.340
I had the impression that he had originated after that war.

38:32.660 --> 38:33.540
He was one of the mutants.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.580
And on the other hand, he seems to go back further than that, way back.

38:37.980 --> 38:42.680
Was there a point in the book where you had specified his origins or was that meant to be a little ambiguous?

38:42.720 --> 38:43.860
It was meant to be a bit ambiguous.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.820
But he was almost or in essence immortal.

38:53.240 --> 38:53.580
Yes.

38:57.600 --> 39:02.240
On the topic of immortality are very long-lived characters.

39:02.860 --> 39:06.500
Many of your characters in your stories are very long-lived.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.660
Why is it that you use this device?

39:12.830 --> 39:18.350
Because I feel comfortable with and enjoy writing about characters who...

39:21.240 --> 39:24.500
have a vast body of experience to draw upon.

39:24.820 --> 39:31.460
Who are very conversant in a great number of areas of history and literature in the sciences.

39:34.240 --> 39:47.420
This sort of highly developed intellect, though, is generally the product of a great number of years in the cultivation.

39:49.680 --> 39:59.900
And if I were to use a character, say, at the age of a person would normally acquire that sort of background,

40:00.220 --> 40:05.720
he'd be too feeble to engage in the activities most of my characters have to engage in,

40:06.400 --> 40:10.300
if the basis were a normal human lifespan we use today.

40:12.320 --> 40:16.240
I got around that in Doorways in the Sand.

40:17.420 --> 40:27.100
By making my protagonist a person who had been an undergraduate actively taking courses full-time for about 13 years.

40:28.100 --> 40:34.640
So that while he was still young enough to climb buildings, he had a sort of force-fed rate acquired.

40:35.260 --> 40:36.420
The kind of...

40:39.440 --> 40:42.120
sensibility I wanted him to possess.

40:42.120 --> 40:55.120
But in a way it is a trick for matching a sufficiently young physique with a sufficiently large intellect.

40:58.040 --> 41:05.860
I noticed in Corwin and Jack and Jack of Shadows a lot of similarities in some of the main characters.

41:05.860 --> 41:11.320
I'm wondering if you put a lot of your own self into some of these protagonists,

41:11.520 --> 41:14.320
if maybe they're kind of an alter ego for you or something like that.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.860
I suppose it's unavoidable to...

41:20.860 --> 41:25.840
I mean, it can't help but put something of yourself into anything you write,

41:26.000 --> 41:30.020
even if it's... even if you're trying to be completely objective.

41:32.400 --> 41:36.160
So to an extent I am present in all of my characters.

41:36.880 --> 41:46.000
To what degree, though I am not absolutely certain, I mean I have written stories with characters.

41:50.710 --> 41:53.580
I am of whom I'm not particularly fond.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.800
On the other hand, no one is completely satisfied with themselves.

42:00.020 --> 42:03.080
So I don't... yes, to some extent I am there.

42:05.140 --> 42:07.020
I would even say is that...

42:07.920 --> 42:12.220
I'm not sure you'd agree with this or not, but I would say there's almost a typical Zalazany hero,

42:12.600 --> 42:14.100
almost like a Hemingway hero.

42:14.860 --> 42:21.700
Sometimes he's immortal, usually a loner, highly literate, sophisticated, knowledgeable, able.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.780
I find that in many of your stories.

42:26.780 --> 42:31.780
Maybe sort of a cynicism too, going along with the sophistication.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.780
Yes, it's hard to get away from that, I guess.

42:35.440 --> 42:40.040
It may be an example of something Gore Vidal once said,

42:40.260 --> 42:45.580
the effect that every author has a certain cast of characters, like a stock company,

42:45.760 --> 42:48.720
and they play different roles in different stories,

42:48.720 --> 42:57.920
but he only has a limited number of people he can introduce at different ages.

42:59.440 --> 43:03.720
On the other hand, I don't like thinking that...

43:04.260 --> 43:09.440
I think there is some truth in this, but I also think that hopefully,

43:10.240 --> 43:12.480
just by virtue of the fact that people do change,

43:12.740 --> 43:17.300
one can add a few more characters here and there over the years to the company.

43:20.020 --> 43:23.760
Bring about further development than the ones who are resident players.

43:27.880 --> 43:31.660
To answer your question simply, I'd say yes, you're probably right.

43:32.020 --> 43:35.600
Just as a sort of a post-cript to that, the Isle of the Dead, Francis Sando,

43:37.200 --> 43:40.260
I thought you must have had a lot of fun constructing him.

43:41.240 --> 43:44.860
To me, he has many of the elements that I see in your fiction,

43:44.960 --> 43:46.680
and other characters all sort of drawn together.

43:46.680 --> 43:55.240
He has almost an ideal job, unlimited funds, near immortality, highly sophisticated,

43:55.680 --> 43:56.800
literate, all of that.

43:57.900 --> 44:03.580
I thought there must have been a lot of yourself going into that kind of a construction.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.640
I was very happy with that.

44:08.580 --> 44:10.240
I enjoyed it, it was a character.

44:12.880 --> 44:16.240
Was that an actual mythology you were working with there when you made out the...

44:16.240 --> 44:18.040
What was it, Shimbled, the Shaker of Thunder?

44:18.300 --> 44:21.160
In fact, he was a god too when you come right down.

44:21.560 --> 44:23.560
Was that one that you constructed yourself?

44:23.740 --> 44:24.700
Yes, yes.

44:25.240 --> 44:27.240
If there are any parallels that were unintentional...

44:31.300 --> 44:34.460
mythology being what it is, I'm sure someone can find parallels somewhere,

44:34.760 --> 44:39.280
but it was not by design.

44:42.520 --> 44:44.520
Are we still rolling, dude? How much time do you have left?

44:44.720 --> 44:47.120
I was mistaken, we had a lot more than eight minutes before.

44:47.400 --> 44:50.380
I was seeing a reflection. We have about five minutes on there now.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.420
Well, okay, let me ask another question.

44:55.640 --> 44:58.320
I've long grown this Tavi Gallinger, the Rose for Ecclesiastes.

44:58.620 --> 45:02.720
In many ways, he's the same as some of these other characters, except of course he's not immortal.

45:03.580 --> 45:05.200
But he has more of a...

45:05.200 --> 45:08.540
I'm not sure this is the right word to use, but I would almost say a bitterness

45:09.500 --> 45:13.700
about him. He actually, I guess, saves the remnants of the Martian culture.

45:14.680 --> 45:19.100
He teaches, inspires them to want to continue to exist, but himself,

45:19.540 --> 45:21.620
he tries to commit suicide at the end.

45:22.680 --> 45:28.860
This is bitterness come because he himself is lacking something

45:28.860 --> 45:31.040
that he can give to others, but yet he doesn't have himself.

45:32.720 --> 45:35.080
I'm not sure that's an awkward question or not.

45:37.180 --> 45:38.380
There was a bitterness about him.

45:38.380 --> 45:39.600
Yes, yes there was.

45:43.340 --> 45:46.080
He is not completely typical.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.520
So if we were talking about a typical Zolaasny character,

45:53.360 --> 45:56.600
it is hard to go back and recall everything that went into him.

45:59.120 --> 46:01.920
But, yeah, certainly there was more in the way of bitterness.

46:04.380 --> 46:08.160
But he's very positive in that he saves the remnants of the Martian culture.

46:08.520 --> 46:14.740
He goes out of his way and extends himself greatly to have them to continue to exist.

46:14.820 --> 46:16.300
He gives them something, gives them the rose.

46:16.900 --> 46:20.840
He shows them that they can still be fertile, that there's a reason to continue to live,

46:20.900 --> 46:21.760
yet he doesn't want to.

46:24.220 --> 46:25.760
I don't know, maybe that's true life.

46:26.220 --> 46:31.900
I'm not sure, but he seemed to have a positive...

46:31.900 --> 46:36.340
But yet himself, he seems to be a negative personality in terms of his own life.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.820
In some ways, yes, there is.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.380
Well, he is a complex character.

46:47.020 --> 46:49.140
There's not too much more I can say about him, though.

46:50.260 --> 46:51.720
Well, one final question on that story.

46:53.360 --> 46:57.440
I may have missed something, but this is probably just a plot device.

46:57.440 --> 47:03.180
But the breeding of the two different races, how that could be possible.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.000
Oh, genetically, no, I couldn't.

47:05.180 --> 47:18.900
It was, as I said, in response to one of the earlier things that I intentionally was writing this in the way as a tribute to the earlier view of Mars in the pulp magazines,

47:18.960 --> 47:21.160
where this sort of thing was possible.

47:21.160 --> 47:29.480
And that was purely the introduction of an outworn convention as a plot device.

47:30.920 --> 47:33.310
I just assumed the reader would...

47:34.280 --> 47:36.500
I cannot consider that story science fiction.

47:36.820 --> 47:41.300
I mean, it is fantasy, really, in that sense.

47:41.480 --> 47:47.840
But no, I am aware of the genetic impossibility of the situation in the first place,

47:47.840 --> 47:49.900
unless the races had had a common origin or something.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.380
But I did it anyway.
