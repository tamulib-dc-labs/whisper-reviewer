00:03.480 --> 00:04.840
Yeah, okay, thanks, Rowling.

00:05.800 --> 00:11.680
First of all, I'd just like to ask you a personal question about how you got started back in science fiction years ago.

00:13.220 --> 00:15.980
Oh, I got started reading it or how I got started writing it?

00:16.360 --> 00:18.440
Reading it way back when you were in your teenage years.

00:19.860 --> 00:23.100
Oh, that's kind of interesting.

00:23.920 --> 00:28.600
Most people don't believe this story, but I actually discovered science fiction when I was wandering around a garbage dump.

00:30.140 --> 00:37.280
There was a garbage dump a few blocks from our house, and I liked it at that time when I was, I guess, about 10 or 11 or something.

00:38.360 --> 00:41.940
Sometimes friends and I would just go down and look around to see what people were drawing out.

00:42.740 --> 00:49.000
And one day among things we found people had thrown out a couple of old pulp magazines from the year before.

00:50.580 --> 00:56.780
Amazing stories, and I think there was one amazing story and one fantastic adventure, supposed to be in companion magazines.

00:56.780 --> 01:02.300
And I grabbed those and brought them home, and I loved them. I got hooked right there.

01:02.820 --> 01:09.240
I started looking for the magazines on the newsstand, and of course found there were a whole lot of other magazines on the newsstand.

01:09.400 --> 01:17.580
To find out stories, and to start with stories, and to start with things thrilling winter stories, weird tales, and began buying all of them almost immediately.

01:20.860 --> 01:25.220
Okay, what about how you got involved in the fan movement, the fan structure?

01:26.620 --> 01:36.300
Well, I grew up directly out of the reading of the pulp magazines, because at that time every magazine being published had a letter column,

01:36.820 --> 01:42.700
usually a long letter column full of letters from the readers saying what they had thought of the previous issue.

01:45.300 --> 01:56.840
And often asking for correspondence, and their addresses would be published there, so I began writing to anybody who was living around the San Francisco area where I was living then.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.740
And got into correspondence with, I guess, about two or three different people.

02:02.600 --> 02:14.620
And through them, I got in touch with the local science fiction club, the Golden Gate Recurian Society, and I joined that.

02:15.480 --> 02:20.800
And at the same time, of course, a number of the magazines were running fanzines or view columns.

02:21.760 --> 02:28.240
And I simply sent off a bunch of fanzines, and immediately began writing for them.

02:28.240 --> 02:36.440
At that time, the first thing, of course, I was writing were amateur science fiction stories, which were quite terrible, but a whole lot of them got published in those early fanzines.

02:38.220 --> 02:43.160
And shortly thereafter, began branching out and doing other things, critical articles and things like that.

02:44.760 --> 02:50.380
I don't think I actually published a fanzine for several years, it was in 1952 when I published my first one.

02:51.620 --> 02:57.880
I was too young, I didn't have any money, and no experience and things like that.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.800
So I gradually worked my way into publishing fanzines.

03:02.720 --> 03:07.560
And during the 50s and then on through the 60s, I was very prolific at publishing fanzines.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.780
I still do publish them occasionally, but not too often these days, because I simply don't have time.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.240
I know this is an obvious question, but I imagine a lot of our listeners may not know this.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.180
Could you just briefly explain what a fanzine is?

03:24.500 --> 03:36.220
Yeah, fanzines are amateur magazines, usually not published for profit, not even with hope of profit, published by readers of science fiction.

03:39.940 --> 03:44.640
Usually, dealing either directly or indirectly with science fiction itself.

03:45.280 --> 03:51.060
Articles on science fiction, articles on science fiction writers or science fiction fans themselves.

03:53.440 --> 04:03.400
And sometimes, just on the things that interest science fiction fans, because of course the people who read science fiction have a wide variety of interests.

04:05.200 --> 04:12.400
But the particular interests of science fiction fans tend to be more intellectual, more scientifically oriented.

04:15.940 --> 04:27.420
So that it's worthwhile for science fiction readers to publish things and just get in contact with other people who read the same things they do and think about the same things as they do.

04:28.000 --> 04:38.740
A typical science fiction fan, especially in the 50s, before science fiction was nearly as popular as it is today, was somebody who didn't know anybody else,

04:38.820 --> 04:41.160
had never met anybody else who was interested in science fiction.

04:41.360 --> 04:49.440
Probably most people who knew him or her were about that they were crazy or had terribly bad taste or something like that.

04:50.640 --> 04:54.980
So it was always fun to get in touch with other people who read the same things you did.

04:57.060 --> 05:02.040
And the fan movement grew out of that. The fan movement actually started about 1930.

05:03.240 --> 05:08.840
But of course I came in pretty late on that. It was going for a long time before I ever got into it.

05:11.420 --> 05:17.800
Okay, Hugo, I believe in 1959 for the best fan publication or something of that sort. Could you explain this?

05:18.540 --> 05:27.680
Yeah, I was publishing with a friend of mine named Ronnie, like a fanzine called Fanac, which is science fiction.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.200
Mr. Carr?

05:49.620 --> 05:49.720
Yeah.

05:50.220 --> 05:52.280
Hold on, please. We have a technical problem on this hand.

05:57.600 --> 06:05.140
Alright. That's very strange. Okay. As soon as I told you we had a technical problem, we no longer had the technical problem.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.800
I'll be right back. Hang on.

06:07.000 --> 06:07.220
Okay.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.100
What happened when you touched that? Didn't you do it?

06:11.720 --> 06:17.700
No, it happened in between one of your questions. We've got a problem with this line right here.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.020
But it doesn't give us any problem unless you move it while you're talking.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.340
Why don't you just don't move it, you thing, do you?

06:26.020 --> 06:26.340
Okay.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.140
So, where are we?

06:33.520 --> 06:36.820
You were, I think, in the middle of your answer about the Hugo for Fanac.

06:37.040 --> 06:42.900
Why don't we just start that one again because we missed about a 30-second honk of it there.

06:43.340 --> 06:57.740
Okay. In 1958, I started publishing a science fiction fanzine, news magazine, called Fanac, which is science fiction language for fan activity.

06:58.500 --> 07:02.600
I was publishing with a friend of mine named Ronnie, like, who was since died.

07:03.800 --> 07:09.140
And we were reporting on the things that other fans were doing.

07:09.640 --> 07:19.840
The fanzines were publishing conventions that were coming up, things like that, people who were getting married and children born, things like that.

07:20.800 --> 07:29.040
Sometimes we would report also on the things science fiction writers were writing or publishers were doing, magazines that were starting up or dying at the time.

07:29.920 --> 07:38.880
But we didn't concentrate on that because there were other science fiction fanzines that were devoted specifically to news about science fiction itself.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.260
And they were well-established at that time, so we didn't want to compete with them.

07:42.260 --> 07:45.020
We concentrated on fandom itself.

07:47.300 --> 07:52.180
And we were publishing it every week, like clockwork.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.800
And it became very popular.

07:56.120 --> 08:05.580
It became a point where, I don't know, everybody who got it said, this is an indispensable thing to have if you're going to be in fandom because you'll never know what's going on, et cetera.

08:07.440 --> 08:14.640
It was a time when there were a lot of controversies going on in fandom, and we were reporting on those.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.880
And a lot of people got involved in it.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.280
And indeed, it was very important fanzine for its time.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.660
It also became popular because we didn't just report on the news.

08:28.660 --> 08:37.400
We also commented on it, and we were rather, how shall I say, sarcastic, ironic.

08:38.140 --> 08:41.300
We didn't treat it with total seriousness.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.000
We thought something was absolutely silly.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.000
We would say so, and we would make fun of things.

08:45.740 --> 08:47.600
And people liked that aspect of it.

08:49.760 --> 08:57.280
So a little over a year after we actually started the fanzine, we received the U-Brow award as the best fanzine of the year.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.060
That was given to us in 1959.

09:03.860 --> 09:04.600
Okay, good.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.520
For just a little while, I'd like to go into your editing career.

09:10.560 --> 09:15.020
I believe from 1964 to 1971, you edited for Ace.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.580
Could you tell me what you did for that?

09:18.300 --> 09:25.140
Yeah, in 1964, I went to work for Ace Books as an editorial assistant.

09:27.280 --> 09:31.200
Which actually meant that I was low-man on the totem pole era.

09:31.520 --> 09:39.080
I was simply somebody who copyrighted his manuscripts, went over them to make sure the spelling was correct and things like that.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.480
There were no type of graphical errors.

09:41.780 --> 09:51.920
And then proofread the books before they actually got published to make sure once again that there were no type of graphical errors in the tight setting.

09:52.680 --> 10:05.380
I would write blurb, cover copy, kind of, you know, the things that are written on the front and back covers of paperback books to try to get you to be interested enough in the book to buy it.

10:07.420 --> 10:11.900
And at the same time, I was reading a number of submissions that were coming in.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.060
If I saw something good, I would pass it on to the editors.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.100
So it was Battle Bull Time.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.260
Now the editor of Dahl's books.

10:18.560 --> 10:22.520
And gradually as things went along, I just got more and more involved in that.

10:23.380 --> 10:28.960
And worked my way up into the company of a lot of my suggestions for things that I thought we ought to be doing.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.060
We're taking seriously.

10:31.600 --> 10:37.520
And Ace Books then did start doing a number of things that I had suggested.

10:38.020 --> 10:40.840
So I began getting dissent at the motion.

10:41.180 --> 10:44.900
I think after about the first three years, I became a senior editor there.

10:47.560 --> 10:56.280
And began a series called the Ace Science Fiction Special, which was very much a departure for Ace Books in particular, but for the entire field for that matter.

10:56.340 --> 11:08.780
Because it was specifically designed to publish adult science fiction novels, not simply juvenile adventure, but serious novels using the science fiction genre as its format.

11:10.040 --> 11:16.660
And packaged uniformly so that people would be able to recognize a new book in the series when it came out.

11:17.420 --> 11:23.420
And packaged in such a way that, you know, it didn't have monsters chasing half-naked women on the covers.

11:24.100 --> 11:28.680
We had very good artwork by a team of artists called Leo and Diane Dillon.

11:30.260 --> 11:33.700
Who later won a Hugo Award and won two Call the Cod Awards.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.240
God knows what else they were extremely good artists.

11:37.580 --> 11:42.260
I also began anthologizing very early when I started there.

11:43.020 --> 11:50.340
Don Wolfe and I were collaborating on an anthology and an annual anthology called World's Best Science Fiction.

11:52.300 --> 11:55.060
And I gradually branched out from that.

11:55.260 --> 11:59.240
That began to have my name on anthologies.

11:59.880 --> 12:04.700
I began to do others for Double Day and Bosset Books and so on.

12:06.060 --> 12:11.480
And that was actually how I got my start doing anthologies was the work that I was doing in Ace Books.

12:14.620 --> 12:18.140
Okay, good. That answered a lot of the other questions I would have about Ace too.

12:19.920 --> 12:26.760
How many series, say the Universe series or the Best Science Fiction of the Year, how many continuing series anthologies are you doing right now?

12:27.960 --> 12:29.720
Right now I'm doing exactly three.

12:30.560 --> 12:35.920
I'm doing the Universe series of which number 12 will be published in June by Double Day.

12:36.700 --> 12:44.300
I'm doing the Best Science Fiction of the Year of which number 11 will be published in July by Times Cave and Pay-for-Vac.

12:45.400 --> 12:51.300
And I'm doing Fantasy Annual of which number five will be published in November, I believe, by Times Cave.

12:52.060 --> 12:55.540
Fantasy Annual is another Best of the Year but that is devoted to fantasy.

12:57.880 --> 13:04.440
I occasionally do individual anthologies too but mostly I try to concentrate on those series books.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.100
Weren't you doing one too, the Best Science Fiction of the Year?

13:10.160 --> 13:14.560
Yeah, I did two volumes of the Best Science Fiction of the Year a few years ago.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.180
And they simply did not sell well enough.

13:18.600 --> 13:25.260
Evidently people wanted to have a greater variety in the length of their stories but they were reading.

13:25.380 --> 13:28.140
They didn't want to have five novellas all in one book.

13:28.240 --> 13:32.120
They wanted to have maybe two or three novellas and a novel that's a short story, all stuck together.

13:34.500 --> 13:40.520
So after the first two books when that experiment didn't prove to be successful it was simply dropped.

13:42.220 --> 13:53.240
And I moved to Best Science Fiction of the Year from the publishers of Best Science Fiction of the Year who were Valentine Del Rey books

13:54.300 --> 14:03.160
over to Times Cave books and lengthened the book from I think it was 125,000 words I was doing at that time.

14:03.340 --> 14:08.100
I lengthened it to 150,000 words so that I could put in one or two more novellas.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.440
And now I'm doing a much more balanced book than I was ever doing before.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.660
Eventually what I'm doing now is both of those books put together.

14:21.660 --> 14:26.660
Okay, the Universe series, now that's totally original science fiction, right?

14:27.360 --> 14:28.320
Yes it is, that's right.

14:29.620 --> 14:35.660
Could you explain the difference say to an author, I'm kind of hazy on this, like an author who has a story to sell.

14:35.660 --> 14:41.580
What's the difference between selling to an original anthology like that or a magazine like Analog or Amazing or something?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.040
There are all sorts of differences.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.880
There are both artistic and monetary differences.

14:50.780 --> 14:58.980
The one thing, if you sell to a magazine then the money that you get from the magazine is simply the payment for that use of the story.

14:59.680 --> 15:05.140
If you sell it to an original anthology that's going into a book and you get an advance payment.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.940
But after that you get a share of the royalties.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.800
If the book sells well then there will be additional earnings on the book.

15:13.640 --> 15:20.500
And the individual authors will continue to make money for years thereafter and indeed they do on Universe because it does sell pretty well.

15:21.540 --> 15:33.000
So your chances of making money on your story are at least as good I would say in the original anthologies as they are in the science fiction magazines.

15:34.100 --> 15:47.580
Aside from that there's also the fact that a lot of writers simply like to have their work appear in book form because they know it's going to be around to be read longer than a magazine will be.

15:47.580 --> 15:52.120
It will stay in better shape and it will be in library or things like that.

15:52.920 --> 16:02.900
And there's also a certain cachet, a certain prestige to appearing in one of the original anthologies.

16:04.060 --> 16:13.420
Because over the years the original anthologies have proven to be a source of much if not most of the best science fiction being published.

16:14.460 --> 16:28.080
So that automatically if you sell to Universe or to New Dimensions one of the other original anthologies series you know that your work is going to be appearing along with much of the other best work to appear in the year.

16:28.460 --> 16:35.260
And you also know that people are going to be looking for those books and expecting to find the best work.

16:35.260 --> 16:44.420
So that if you have a really good story for instance and maybe you think you have a chance at winning an award or a new goer or something like that.

16:44.660 --> 16:54.900
Your chances are somewhat enhanced if you're in one of these original anthologies because people who are looking for the really top stories think of those first.

16:55.780 --> 17:03.140
And I think possibly they tend to think of what has appeared in those first also when it comes time to nominate these things.

17:03.280 --> 17:07.920
Or it may just be that the best stories do appear in those books.

17:08.040 --> 17:20.620
But in any case I once did a breakdown of where the stories of the past ten years that have won nebulas and or hugos had appeared.

17:20.620 --> 17:27.100
And there's a disproportionate amount I think it's something like 40% of them had appeared in original stories anthologies.

17:30.440 --> 17:37.400
Okay what about what about an editor's say your function as the editor of the Universe series.

17:37.700 --> 17:47.340
I mean do you actively seek stories do you editorially comment and ask for changes in the stories like what would be the difference between you doing that and say an editor for a magazine.

17:48.240 --> 17:54.140
There's not a great deal of difference between what I do as an editor and what a magazine editor will do.

17:55.420 --> 18:05.640
We both will work with an author if a story seems good enough to sell to us but not quite right we want a few changes.

18:06.420 --> 18:11.220
Then of course we'll discuss them with the author and see if the author agrees and wants to make those changes.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.100
There's no difference there.

18:13.780 --> 18:20.840
The prime difference between the way I work well two differences between the way I work and the way magazine editors work.

18:21.020 --> 18:26.200
Number one a magazine editor has a deadline every month to get a magazine out.

18:26.860 --> 18:41.060
So the magazine editor really has to have a certain number of stories to publish every month whether or not enough really top stories have come in.

18:41.060 --> 18:43.160
The editor still has to publish the magazine.

18:44.340 --> 18:45.580
I don't have that problem.

18:46.980 --> 18:50.420
I get a contract and I have about six months to put together a book.

18:50.540 --> 18:55.200
It usually takes me about two or three months to get enough stories that if I need to pull six months I can do that.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.900
So I don't have a tight deadline and I can keep my standards higher.

19:01.020 --> 19:17.780
Secondarily I work differently from most of the magazine editors in that I have more time because I'm only doing one book a year to go around to specific authors and ask them for a story that they're working on.

19:17.960 --> 19:27.740
They may not have that story ready for another three, four or six months but I can talk to them in advance and say well I'll be buying next April or something like that.

19:27.740 --> 19:30.240
So please send it to me then.

19:31.040 --> 19:43.780
Most of the stories that I get on submission are from people I know either personally or through the mail as writers from whom I've solicited stories.

19:44.820 --> 19:53.220
Whereas the magazines try to do that but they're very heavily overworked editors at the magazines because they have these kinds of deadlines.

19:53.220 --> 19:59.540
And they don't have time as much time as I do anyway to go after individual authors and ask for stories.

20:00.540 --> 20:06.180
So I think there's a higher percentage of stories that I buy from authors I ask for stories by.

20:09.140 --> 20:17.760
Okay on the Best Science Fiction of the Year series, could you just tell me a little bit about the criteria you use to pick stories?

20:17.760 --> 20:21.160
Do you go simply for only for the best stories or do you look for balance?

20:21.380 --> 20:24.660
Do you look for the names or what kind of criteria do you have?

20:26.740 --> 20:29.420
I go about 90% for the best stories.

20:31.520 --> 20:37.140
The names don't bother me because it always turns out that most of the best stories are by name writers.

20:37.580 --> 20:40.500
This is how they became name writers in the first place by writing good stories.

20:43.040 --> 20:49.080
As I read during the year, all year long, sort of day by day, week by week, month by month,

20:49.780 --> 20:53.560
every time I read a story that I think is a particularly good story,

20:54.400 --> 20:59.440
a candidate for the best science fiction of the year, whether or the fantasy annual, the best fantasy of the year.

21:00.280 --> 21:05.240
I make a card and I put it in the card file and that card will tell me the title of the author word,

21:05.240 --> 21:08.960
and it will tell me how long it is and give a brief trace of the plot.

21:09.940 --> 21:20.440
At the end of the year, I simply go through those cards and pick out what I consider to be the best 150,000 words out of that.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.460
Then I look at that to see what the editorial balance is like.

21:26.660 --> 21:32.800
I do want to be sure that there aren't too many stories that are down-beat and depressing because that's just not fun to read.

21:32.800 --> 21:42.380
There may be good stories individually, but you just string them all end to end and they can actually seem not as good as they are.

21:43.120 --> 21:48.880
So I try to work on that kind of balance and I try to mix up the balance between longer stories and shorter stories

21:48.880 --> 21:51.180
because people do like variety in that.

21:52.680 --> 21:58.640
And if it should ever happen for instance, I think the best 15 stories of the year, however many it takes,

22:00.040 --> 22:03.280
are all time travel stories for instance.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.540
I'm not going to publish a whole book full of time travel stories, that's just silly.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.360
Again, people would get tired of reading so many time travel stories in one book.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.380
So I try to mix up the themes too.

22:14.980 --> 22:19.740
But the editorial balance is really something that I do after I've chosen the best stories themselves

22:19.740 --> 22:24.560
and rarely does it make a great deal of difference in the balance of the book itself.

22:26.320 --> 22:32.800
Usually there is a lot of variety in all of these things already so that I don't have to take too much.

22:37.900 --> 22:42.700
Okay, could you just give me maybe a little philosophy or theory behind an anthology?

22:42.880 --> 22:44.260
What kind of need does it fill?

22:47.640 --> 22:49.000
Kind of a vague question.

22:50.960 --> 22:56.840
As Beth Dino's an anthology fills the need for people who want to read good science fiction short stories,

22:57.540 --> 22:59.580
novel lessons, novellas, whatever.

23:00.580 --> 23:05.100
People who want to read something other than a novel.

23:05.980 --> 23:11.440
Probably people who want to have something that they can dip into from time to time

23:11.440 --> 23:15.060
rather than sitting down and reading the whole thing straight through as they would a novel.

23:16.500 --> 23:20.180
There's a different psychology between reading novels and short stories

23:20.180 --> 23:22.000
and most people do prefer to read novels.

23:22.200 --> 23:27.200
They always sell better than anthologies or single-loss short story collections.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.500
But there are people who like the short stories.

23:31.640 --> 23:32.280
I do, for instance.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.580
And there are the people who buy these.

23:36.140 --> 23:41.620
For a reprint anthology, I think like the best science fiction of the year

23:41.620 --> 23:48.740
or some other kind of anthology, the theme anthology that comes out.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.060
A whole bunch of stories about robots or something like that.

23:54.100 --> 23:59.620
On a reprint anthology, the attraction I think is that these stories have been doubly screened.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.680
They're stories that were good enough in the first place to sell to the magazine.

24:04.780 --> 24:08.560
And then beyond that, they're the best stories from the magazine.

24:08.560 --> 24:13.560
So the people who pick up an anthology can reasonably expect that that is going to contain

24:13.560 --> 24:17.020
more good stories than the average issue of a science fiction magazine.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.940
This is always true. There's very bad anthologies and there's very good issues in magazines.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.280
But by and large, that is the case, I think.

24:28.140 --> 24:31.280
Okay, I know you've done a lot of theme or specialized anthologies.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.880
I have a whole list of them here in front of me.

24:32.900 --> 24:36.940
I just wanted to say pick out a couple and ask a question on them.

24:38.160 --> 24:41.700
This earlier one called Science Fiction for People Who Hate Science Fiction.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.340
How did you go about picking those stories?

24:46.320 --> 24:53.760
That was my first anthology that I did under my own name and nobody else's name.

24:54.840 --> 24:59.380
It was, I think, in fact, the second anthology I did right after the first world-best science fiction.

25:00.360 --> 25:06.380
And the idea, I wanted a book that could be given to people who don't normally read science fiction.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.740
Who think that they wouldn't like it.

25:10.700 --> 25:14.460
And I wanted, first, that the story should be good stories.

25:15.140 --> 25:20.840
And second, that the story should be accessible to people who don't know the specialized language of science fiction.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.840
There are a whole lot of assumptions that are just automatic in science fiction

25:25.840 --> 25:28.380
and nobody bothers to explain them anymore.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.840
So there are a lot of stories that are published these days

25:31.760 --> 25:35.980
that really require a certain amount of background in reading science fiction in order to understand them.

25:36.460 --> 25:39.880
I mean, nobody stops to explain what a star warp drive is anymore

25:39.880 --> 25:42.180
because that gets a little bit tiresome after a while.

25:42.280 --> 25:46.120
We all know how a star warp drive works, more or less.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.360
Or at least we think we do.

25:49.480 --> 25:54.160
But to somebody who's never heard of that before, that can be kind of confusing.

25:54.160 --> 26:02.500
Or the intricacies of the morality of robot behavior

26:04.940 --> 26:09.410
or the strangeness of time paradoxes.

26:10.160 --> 26:13.880
Things like that can be very confusing to someone first coming to science fiction.

26:14.580 --> 26:20.900
So the stories that I chose for that book were stories that had very simple dramatic ideas

26:20.900 --> 26:25.800
that were very easy to understand to someone who was not used to science fiction right away

26:26.300 --> 26:28.240
but that were also very good stories.

26:29.100 --> 26:37.700
And the theory on the book was that people would buy that a number of them would simply buy it for themselves

26:37.700 --> 26:43.780
and also a number that would buy it to give to friends there in hopes of convincing them that they might like science fiction too.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.980
And the book sold pretty well.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.980
In fact, it's still in print in a small paperback edition.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.300
I think it was published about 16 years ago.

26:52.460 --> 26:53.000
It's still in print.

26:56.020 --> 26:58.000
Good. Yeah, I was going to ask if it was still in print.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.280
Yeah, it's in print from, I think it's a Collier's book.

27:03.660 --> 27:06.500
Okay, another one I had a brief question on was a more recent one,

27:07.160 --> 27:10.220
Dreams Edge, Science Fiction Stories about the Future of the Planet Earth.

27:10.940 --> 27:14.220
I understand that was done sort of with the Sierra Club.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.760
Could you explain the origin or the impetus for that one?

27:17.980 --> 27:23.820
Yeah, the origin of that was that the Sierra Club themselves decided they wanted to publish science fiction anthology

27:24.740 --> 27:28.700
and they looked around for someone to do it and they eventually landed on me,

27:30.100 --> 27:36.100
partly because I was known as an anthologist and partly because Sierra Club's main office was in San Francisco and I lived nearby.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.880
So they got in touch with me and we discussed the book.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.140
And I went ahead and put it together.

27:43.140 --> 27:52.980
The main problem I had with that book was that there were too many stories in it that were downbeat and depressing.

27:53.180 --> 27:57.420
If you start writing about the ecology of Earth, which is what the theme of that was,

27:59.140 --> 28:06.380
well, everything's going wrong these days, as you know, and nobody really has any answers about what we can do about it.

28:07.320 --> 28:12.540
And if people picked up that book to find that science fiction writers had the answers that were going to save us,

28:14.180 --> 28:17.260
they were going to be disappointed because there simply aren't any.

28:17.420 --> 28:21.420
If there were any answers, it wouldn't be in a science fiction book, you know,

28:21.500 --> 28:24.240
it would be something that was being done already.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.780
So even though I think all the stories in there are very good,

28:29.620 --> 28:33.140
there are only a few of them that hold out a whole lot of hope.

28:33.540 --> 28:40.320
Most of them are about the problem and the irony of messing around with the environment and so on.

28:42.800 --> 28:46.020
I have to confess I haven't been able to find that book. Is it in paperback?

28:46.760 --> 28:50.200
Yeah, it's in a trade paperback, again, from Sierra Club Book.

28:51.900 --> 28:55.100
Okay, I'm a member of the Sierra Club too. I just haven't been able to get ahold of the head.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.800
No, I expect you can get it. It's probably in the back of somewhere.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.200
It's only published about a year and a half ago.

29:03.220 --> 29:04.640
Okay, would it be fair to ask you?

29:04.820 --> 29:07.440
They did very small hard-cover printing times. Sure, that's out of print.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.280
So the paperback has a much larger printing.

29:12.440 --> 29:16.920
Okay. Could I ask you if you have any particular favorites among the anthologies you put together?

29:20.020 --> 29:25.840
Yeah, I have as a matter of fact, a number of them were favorites of mine, I think.

29:27.800 --> 29:34.060
Oh, there are a number of the best science fiction of the year volumes that I think are extremely good, just because they were very good years.

29:34.280 --> 29:36.120
A lot of good stories appeared in those years.

29:37.160 --> 29:42.560
I couldn't tell you the exact numbers of the exact years, but there were some in the early 70s, for instance.

29:43.820 --> 29:48.560
One or two of the more recent ones, some of the ones from the late 60s, I think, are extremely good.

29:48.560 --> 29:54.460
There's one that had two novelettes by Roger Zalazzo, who was just starting out in science fiction,

29:54.640 --> 29:58.140
was writing at the height of his power, and a bunch of other good stories.

30:00.240 --> 30:07.040
But aside from that, there's an anthology that I did for Harper and Row about five years ago,

30:07.580 --> 30:10.420
called Classic Science Fiction of the First Golden Age,

30:11.100 --> 30:16.400
which is a big, thick anthology of stories from 1940 to 1942,

30:16.860 --> 30:20.960
which is generally considered the time that science fiction first became really good.

30:22.520 --> 30:29.280
And I run back and read every one of the magazines published in those three years, and there were very many of those magazines.

30:30.280 --> 30:37.260
And I chose all of the stories that I considered the best, most of which turned out to be pretty well-known stories,

30:37.260 --> 30:42.540
their classic stories, by his bootstrap, the Robert A. Heinlein, and the Twalkie by Henry Cuthner, and so on.

30:43.940 --> 30:51.660
But at the same time, I also did a lot of research on the writers, on the editors, the publishing companies, the artists, and so forth,

30:52.360 --> 30:55.600
the conditions under which they worked, how much money they were actually able to make.

30:56.640 --> 31:04.080
And I wrote a great deal of introductory material, background material about the writers and what they were doing,

31:04.200 --> 31:06.100
how they came to write each individual story.

31:06.100 --> 31:09.820
I interviewed these writers, either in person or by mail.

31:10.600 --> 31:14.360
I looked through all the old magazines or whatever was said there.

31:15.620 --> 31:21.100
And since I collect old fanzines, I had a lot of the fan magazines that were published in the early 1940s,

31:21.960 --> 31:26.120
so that I had more or less direct information there, too, about what was happening.

31:27.100 --> 31:32.420
And I think the anthology itself contains a number of just classic stories.

31:32.420 --> 31:36.280
It's a basic anthology for anybody's science fiction library.

31:37.100 --> 31:44.960
But in addition to that, that background material is fascinating, tells a whole lot of things about how things happen and why they happen,

31:45.440 --> 31:50.900
and also tells a number of pretty amusing stories about things that went on behind the scenes.

31:51.340 --> 31:52.620
I really enjoyed doing the book.

31:54.440 --> 31:57.740
I'm familiar with that one. I've read that that's considered to be one of your best.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.960
Let me ask you one more question about your work as an editor.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.360
How does a freelance editor work anyhow?

32:04.660 --> 32:09.300
Do you make contracts with the authors and give them payment and then go to the publisher?

32:10.180 --> 32:11.580
What are the mechanics of that?

32:12.300 --> 32:15.260
The mechanics are, at first I sell a book to the publisher.

32:15.880 --> 32:19.580
There's no way I can make a contact with the author unless I have some money to offer.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.060
So I go to the publisher first.

32:22.200 --> 32:26.900
The publisher buys it and gives me a contact which guarantees me a certain amount of money, whatever it is,

32:26.900 --> 32:28.240
and he gives me a book.

32:29.460 --> 32:35.440
And I then do my buying from the authors and make individual contracts with them.

32:39.180 --> 32:40.820
Okay, that explains it.

32:42.320 --> 32:46.400
If you have a little more time, I'd like to go on to just a little bit about your own writing.

32:46.980 --> 32:47.500
Sure, go.

32:48.520 --> 32:52.960
Okay, from what I understand, you had your first professional story published in 1962.

32:54.620 --> 32:56.140
What, Who Sups with the Devil?

32:57.260 --> 32:58.100
I believe it was.

33:00.380 --> 33:06.340
Okay, could you tell me the, oh I don't know about when you decided you wanted to become a professional writer

33:06.340 --> 33:10.440
and how you got the first story published.

33:10.580 --> 33:11.400
Just a little bit about that.

33:13.860 --> 33:18.620
Yeah, in 1961, I had been living in the Bay Area.

33:18.620 --> 33:22.480
And I suddenly decided I was going to just leave the Bay Area.

33:22.820 --> 33:24.220
I didn't like the way life was going.

33:24.380 --> 33:25.400
Here I wasn't doing anything.

33:26.260 --> 33:30.580
I was 24 years old, didn't really have a direction to my life yet.

33:31.520 --> 33:36.520
So I went to New York City to visit with a friend of mine for a month or however long.

33:37.560 --> 33:41.460
And as soon as I got there, I thought, well, do you ever have a job?

33:41.580 --> 33:43.640
I really ought to do something to make some money.

33:44.260 --> 33:50.440
And I had been writing science fiction stories, as I said earlier, since I was a kid, since I was 11 years older.

33:50.660 --> 33:54.440
So I turned back to writing science fiction.

33:56.380 --> 34:03.660
And at one point, I had a copy of that story, Who Sups with the Devil.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.740
And I was actually working on another story.

34:06.880 --> 34:12.540
That story was on submission with a magazine, which wanted to buy it, but they weren't sure they were going to have a second issue or not.

34:13.640 --> 34:14.100
So I was kind of on hold.

34:16.100 --> 34:21.960
And the editor of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Arvind Davidson, came into the office where I was working.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.500
It was an office where a number of us were working.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.240
And he had just become the editor, in fact, that day.

34:28.620 --> 34:32.760
And he came in to announce to us that he was the new editor of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

34:33.220 --> 34:34.180
And he saw that I was working.

34:36.700 --> 34:41.860
I said, well, this is the one I'm working on now is in finished, but I do have this other one.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.020
And I showed him the carbon copy of that.

34:45.400 --> 34:52.280
He went into the other room and read it and came back in five minutes and said he liked it and knew it's buy it, which totally blew my mind.

34:52.860 --> 34:56.440
You know, if a guy just walks in the door and buys you a first story like that.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.020
So he took that.

34:59.880 --> 35:04.000
And in fact, he bought the next half dozen stories that I wrote.

35:06.120 --> 35:13.000
In fact, thereafter, I haven't written a single story since that time that I haven't eventually been able to sell.

35:13.480 --> 35:18.840
I don't have any story sitting in my trunk, you know, that are unsalvageable or anything like that.

35:23.560 --> 35:24.080
Okay.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.840
One thing that's puzzling me a little bit.

35:28.360 --> 35:33.640
In 1973, you've got another Hugo, which I believe was for the best fan writer of the year.

35:34.000 --> 35:34.720
That's right. Yeah.

35:35.260 --> 35:38.840
How can you be considered a fan when you've been publishing professional science fiction?

35:41.280 --> 35:45.260
There's nothing stopping you from being a fan just because you make your money writing professionally.

35:47.100 --> 35:54.080
I didn't get that award for the stories that I was publishing in professional magazines.

35:54.920 --> 36:00.520
I got that for the material that I was writing for amateur magazines because I had to stop doing that.

36:00.520 --> 36:04.900
I'm still interested in the amateur field. It's quite different from the professional field.

36:06.040 --> 36:13.420
And I had written a number of things the previous year, enough things that people liked that I managed to win that award that year.

36:14.120 --> 36:18.960
A lot of other people who have won that award are professionals and were professionals at the time that they won it.

36:19.820 --> 36:25.860
The first, Hugo, who was the best fan writer, went to Alexei Panshin, who was a professional at the time.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.480
The second one to Ted White, who was a professional at the time.

36:30.840 --> 36:36.320
And among the other people who have won it have been Bob Shaw, who's won it twice.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.780
He's been writing professionally for about 15 years.

36:39.940 --> 36:42.400
And a number of other professional writers have won it.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.200
People who have never sold professionally have also won it.

36:45.420 --> 36:54.920
It's really just a matter of doing work in the amateur magazines, work that you give away for nothing, essentially, that you do for love.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.980
As opposed to work that you write for money.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.340
Okay, that's good enough.

37:06.580 --> 37:10.820
Your last novel, I guess it was published in 1977, Cirque.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.060
I've admired that book for some time.

37:15.960 --> 37:20.880
I know what the word Cirque means, I think, but I'm not sure why you picked it for the title. Could you explain that?

37:22.600 --> 37:27.120
I picked it for the title because I couldn't think of a better title, actually.

37:27.940 --> 37:31.680
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that that was the inevitable title of the book.

37:32.580 --> 37:39.120
The book, of course, is about a city which is built around a gigantic chasm into the ground.

37:41.140 --> 37:47.800
And so the city is named Cirque, which is French for circle, and has other connotations, too.

37:48.680 --> 37:53.540
It also, for instance, is the French word for circus.

37:55.480 --> 37:59.960
And it was kind of a circus, there were a whole lot of strange things going on at once in the book.

38:02.240 --> 38:05.900
And the construction of the book is circular.

38:06.840 --> 38:13.740
It starts at dawn on one day, and it goes ahead to finish at dawn the next day.

38:13.740 --> 38:20.600
And it finishes at the same place in the city where it began with the same characters there.

38:21.560 --> 38:26.940
So in all those ways, Cirque or circle was the perfect title for the book.

38:28.300 --> 38:34.540
The only thing it really had going against it is that nobody knows how to pronounce it, or at least nobody is sure how to pronounce it.

38:36.320 --> 38:40.660
Yeah, I teach English here at Odessa College, and I'm very sensitive to the way books are put together.

38:40.660 --> 38:49.640
And I was very impressed with the tight structure of that, the coherence and the way you interwoven with the various characters and brought them together at the end was just fascinating to me.

38:50.180 --> 38:53.360
It was very difficult to do because I didn't have an outline for the book.

38:54.020 --> 39:02.460
I was making it up as I went along, and the closer I got to the end, the more panicked I got, whether or not I was actually going to be able to pull it off.

39:03.340 --> 39:07.160
I actually had to do two drafts of it to make sure that it worked out properly.

39:07.660 --> 39:21.040
I think it did. In fact, it worked out so neatly in the second to final draft that I actually had to go back through the ending and make a few things not quite as neat as they had been because it seemed a little bit too tight.

39:23.420 --> 39:41.320
Yeah, you said you weren't following a plan and so forth, but I got the impression you were deliberately injecting symbolism or almost kind of an allegory into it with, say, the abyss that collects all the filth and the garbage and breathes these monsters which later turn into flowers and so forth.

39:41.940 --> 39:44.540
Were you deliberately attempting a symbolic structure?

39:44.540 --> 39:58.020
Oh yes, that is definitely deliberate. I knew the general outline of the story. I just didn't know the specifics of who was going to do what at which time and where they were going to be and so on.

39:58.920 --> 40:02.140
The symbolism is built into the whole concept of the story.

40:03.680 --> 40:19.680
And I tried not to make that show too much on the top. I wanted the surface to be a story that was interesting in and of itself because I don't believe that symbolism itself should ever try to carry a story that's worth any tears.

40:19.680 --> 40:35.140
On the other hand, if you have a good story up front and beneath that story is symbolism, preferably emotional symbolism, not just intellectual cuteness. I think that strengthens the story a good deal.

40:35.860 --> 40:38.960
There's a fair amount of symbolism in my short story too.

40:41.960 --> 40:57.000
Okay, at the end of that story it seems like everyone is better off. Nicky, the girl with the multiple personalities, Annaly, the telepath, Jamie, Dorianne, they all discovered something it seems. Could you explain what it is that they found out?

40:59.140 --> 41:16.760
Essentially what it is that they found out is that reality is what you make of it through various means. On the surface again it was a matter of coming to realize that you could make these monsters into flowers.

41:16.760 --> 41:31.260
This sounds silly when we talk about it, see where I don't like to talk about my plot. You could turn monsters into flowers if you by thinking of them as flowers as something beautiful and good and pleasing because of the nature of the monster.

41:32.480 --> 41:42.680
But in other ways, all of the characters come to realize that they have control over their own lives. They can look at their lives any way they want them, they can do anything that they want.

41:43.240 --> 41:53.020
So they all, in one way or another, by the end of the book, have made positive choices in their own minds as a result of the adventures they've gone through during the story.

41:55.740 --> 42:02.300
I know it must be difficult for an author to get questions like that on his own work, but let me try one more on that book, The Millipede.

42:06.320 --> 42:13.100
He was part, well I guess he was my favorite character in the book, he seemed to be all-molting and in control of the situation and so forth.

42:14.320 --> 42:22.120
Why was he necessary for these people? Why couldn't these people have found out what they needed to know without his part in the story?

42:24.100 --> 42:33.820
So that again is built into the idea of the story. Actually he was there because I just love writing about aliens because I love writing about strange minds about death.

42:34.360 --> 42:44.000
And that particular alien, by the way, is not a he, it's an it. And I was very careful not to say he anywhere in there. It's an alien who doesn't have any particular effect.

42:44.800 --> 42:53.220
But anyway, that alien sees time, both the future and the past, always happening at once.

42:53.840 --> 43:05.500
And the alien is not so much in control of the situation as simply knowing what's going to happen and accepting it because it's inevitable the future is as inevitable as the past to this alien.

43:09.360 --> 43:24.080
And the alien doesn't actually control what goes on, but the alien is a catalyst. Just as for instance, I think it's Annaly who is the telepathic monitor, is the ultimate catalyst.

43:24.880 --> 43:38.480
Because it is she who broadcasts telepathically to the other people, her vision of exactly what can happen to make things work out better at the end.

43:39.840 --> 43:46.900
So it isn't really the Militeed who does it, but had the Militeed not been there, things would have happened differently.

43:47.940 --> 43:53.420
Because the Militeed had its effect on Annaly and so forth, and all the other characters.

43:54.240 --> 44:02.480
On the other hand, the Militeed could not be there because, as the book has set out, the Militeed was there. The Militeed knows it.

44:02.480 --> 44:18.760
The Militeed, for instance, at one point takes a great risk of getting killed, but the Militeed knows what's going to happen to it and knows that risk and the pain that goes with it is going to happen.

44:18.760 --> 44:37.000
And indeed, the Militeed doesn't have any... The Militeed is the only character in the book who has no self-polition in that the Militeed knows exactly what the future holds and his power was to change it.

44:37.480 --> 44:46.660
Whereas the other people who are unable to see what the future holds do have the power to change things, and that's one of the things that actually comes out of the book.

44:47.260 --> 44:55.840
I don't think anybody's actually noticed that about this book, but most of the people have happy endings because they take over control of their own lives.

44:56.840 --> 45:08.520
The Militeed has a happy ending simply because the Militeed... What happens to the Militeed was always going to be a happy ending and the Militeed knew it.

45:10.160 --> 45:14.660
I don't know if that's coherent, but it's difficult to talk about these kind of things.

45:14.680 --> 45:21.860
It's very difficult to work with that concept in the book and try to make it coherent in the book. I think it works in the book because you can follow what happens in the story.

45:24.540 --> 45:27.200
No, I can follow that. I got that out of the book personally.

45:29.960 --> 45:31.740
Just a second, David, do we have to change tape now?

45:32.020 --> 45:32.240
Yeah.

45:32.980 --> 45:36.020
Listen, I have about five or ten more minutes. Could you give us that much more?

45:36.560 --> 45:36.880
Sure.

45:37.260 --> 45:40.660
Okay, David, have to switch the tape just a second. We've got to turn it around.
