00:08.880 --> 00:12.820
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.960
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.340
And here are your hosts.

00:42.820 --> 00:44.420
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.520
Locus is the trade newspaper in the science fiction field.

00:47.860 --> 00:52.040
1983 marked the 16th year of publication, and Locus has won seven Hugo Awards.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.440
The founder of Locus is Charles Brown, whom we talked with recently.

00:55.860 --> 00:59.480
Here Brown tells us how and why he started Locus and how it has evolved.

00:59.880 --> 01:03.320
I started Locus in 1968.

01:04.680 --> 01:11.140
It started, one of the main reasons I started is because I wanted to be able to learn how to write.

01:11.760 --> 01:15.560
I was a full-time fan, and I could never seem to write anybody a letter.

01:16.400 --> 01:23.300
So I decided if I had myself a deadline at that time, it was every two weeks, I would get some experience with writing.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.100
I'll be able to write letters and things like that.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.640
Well, it's 15 years later.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.800
I still can't write letters.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.040
I can still put out the magazine.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.540
It mainly evolved from being about fandom.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.360
It was done every other weekend.

01:42.560 --> 01:49.960
It was written on Friday, stenciled on Saturday, runoff and mailed on Sunday.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.820
It was always every other weekend.

01:53.740 --> 01:58.180
There was a gang of people in the house helping out, things like that.

01:58.180 --> 01:59.000
And it just kept growing.

02:00.280 --> 02:05.660
The one thing about a magazine is if you keep putting out issues, you get more and more news.

02:06.800 --> 02:14.740
And gradually it changed over more towards the professional side, mainly because that's where my interests were.

02:15.620 --> 02:19.340
And they were the people who responded more often than fast.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.040
And eventually it grew to a point where I couldn't print it anymore.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.900
We went to professional printing and it's been growing ever since.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.200
And it's about the length of a short novel now.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.020
It started out as just one page.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.980
So that's how it grew.

02:37.980 --> 02:40.720
Locus has grown to be a major force in the science fiction field.

02:40.940 --> 02:44.860
We asked Brown if in the early days he ever anticipated that Locus would get to be so important.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.120
Well, no.

02:46.220 --> 02:50.520
It originally started out to only run for two years.

02:51.720 --> 02:58.820
One of the other things it started out was this was an advertisement for the Boston Group.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.540
We were bidding for a world comp.

03:02.280 --> 03:06.580
I just wrote the original and the Boston Group put it out, but that didn't work very well.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.780
At the end of two years they did win the convention.

03:09.780 --> 03:11.500
I think mainly because of Locus.

03:12.500 --> 03:16.860
But then we discovered that we were being nominated for a UGO.

03:17.400 --> 03:22.340
It seemed like it would be interesting to run it right through the Boston convention and try and win a UGO.

03:23.180 --> 03:25.580
Which we did, and after that we just never stopped.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.480
But I never imagined it would grow that much.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.400
Brown worked for many years as an electrical engineer and produced Locus part-time.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.760
Then that changed.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.640
There was a break in the engineering field in 1975.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.740
And I got laid off for the first time in my life.

03:44.840 --> 03:50.320
And I figured while I was waiting for the field to pick up again, I would try writing for the year.

03:51.560 --> 03:56.840
And if I did, I wrote, oh, I wrote mostly non-fiction articles for magazines.

03:57.360 --> 04:02.840
I did Locus on the side and try to build it up as much as possible.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.700
And eventually I discovered I didn't even have to go back to work.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.700
Every once in a while I get a call for an engineering job.

04:12.860 --> 04:16.080
I feel very good about that, but I have no intention of having to go back to school.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.520
One question that naturally springs to mind is, what is the origin of Locus?

04:29.740 --> 04:35.220
Locus is the connecting points in a circle.

04:36.200 --> 04:44.440
And we considered ourselves connecting points to the science fiction professionals, fans, and publishers.

04:45.180 --> 04:50.720
And the other thing was just from the old Spanish phrase of L.O.C., letter of comment.

04:52.840 --> 04:56.820
That's why the letter column is still called Locus with a capital L.O.C.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.660
Join us on our next show when we'll talk more with Charles Brown.

05:08.080 --> 05:13.620
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:13.620 --> 05:16.860
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.380


05:59.880 --> 06:03.840
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.160
Stay with us.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.060
Stay with us.

06:19.620 --> 06:24.920
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.280
And here are your hosts.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.540
This is Daryl Lane.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.320
And Bill Vernon.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.780
Locus is science fiction's leading trade magazine.

06:37.780 --> 06:40.600
It's written for professional writers and for serious readers.

06:40.960 --> 06:43.720
The professionals get information on prospective markets.

06:43.980 --> 06:47.980
The readers get up-to-date information on reviews, conventions, and forthcoming books.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.840
But Locus has its roots in fandom.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.360
Charles Brown, its founder, editor, and publisher,

06:52.580 --> 06:56.380
tells us how he discovered science fiction fandom soon after he began reading science fiction.

06:56.380 --> 07:00.440
Oh, I started reading science fiction.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.720
I was reading Astounding in the 40s.

07:04.260 --> 07:08.680
I discovered fandom all around 1949.

07:11.120 --> 07:19.960
I was finding a convention listed in one of the magazines, Super Science Stories, or something like that.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.540
And they listed a 1950 convention.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.540
And I was 12 years old, and I went to this convention.

07:27.880 --> 07:33.220
I had a wonderful time, and I met all these old men like Fred Cole and Lester Del Rey.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.260
They were all, most of them were pushing 30.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.580
And when you're 12, you don't think anybody's ever going to reach 30.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.040
That's really up there.

07:45.040 --> 07:51.420
And now it's frightening, because I see all these people, and they're considered the same age, pretty much.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.720
But that was how I still was fandom.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.900
And I put out my first fanzine about 1951.

08:03.480 --> 08:09.080
Dropped out again when I was in college and things like that.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.020
And eventually went back to the late 50s.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.680
So Brown has been involved in fandoms since 1950.

08:16.180 --> 08:18.840
We asked him how fandom has changed through the years.

08:20.040 --> 08:24.320
1950, there were all these completely 13-year-old kids, and that was about it.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.120
I was talking to Harlan Ellison today, and he says,

08:30.120 --> 08:35.020
the one thing, he just came back from Australia, he's just a lot of the Australian convention.

08:35.800 --> 08:39.000
It's just like American fandom in the 50s.

08:39.340 --> 08:41.920
There were all these completely 13-year-old kids and no women.

08:42.560 --> 08:46.760
They were all very sincere, very bright, and very socially inept.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.240
They pretty well have fandom, wasn't it?

08:50.580 --> 08:51.220
I think it was.

08:59.340 --> 09:01.200
Annually, Brown conducts the Locus Poll.

09:01.520 --> 09:06.600
The poll is a tally of readers' responses to such topics as favorite novels, short stories, artists, and so on.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.720
And it reveals some personal information as well.

09:09.100 --> 09:12.380
One bit of information is that the average Locus reader seems to be getting older.

09:12.380 --> 09:18.920
Our audience has always gotten older, mainly because the audience has stayed with us.

09:19.740 --> 09:29.460
About 80% of the people who read Locus in 1968 still read Locus, which, of course, keeps raising the ages.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.340
There are some new people, but not that many.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.220
One of the changes, of course, is in the magazine.

09:39.340 --> 09:43.780
The magazine is no longer aimed at teenage fans.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.160
It's aimed at the professionals.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.080
And, of course, that means we attract the older professionals.

09:53.240 --> 10:00.100
I think there are probably no more than two or three professionals who are not described at the moment.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.340
Brown has been publishing Locus for 16 years.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.060
We ask him if he still gets satisfaction from it.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.220
I was looking at the blue lines for the new issue today.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.580
It's very exciting.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.260
The first time you see it come together.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.960
You see all the photographs together.

10:16.300 --> 10:20.120
All the stories in one place instead of pieces.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.800
And you still get a real thrill when you hold that first copy.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.900
I'll get my final copy tomorrow.

10:32.260 --> 10:36.200
I'll be down at the printer at 8:30 in the morning watching it be run off.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.920
I'll pull out a copy myself and staple it together.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.740
And then I'll have another copy.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.640
We'll have more with Charles Brown on our next show.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.560
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:54.560 --> 10:57.460
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

10:57.460 --> 11:00.700
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:00.700 --> 11:00.820


11:06.780 --> 11:07.140


11:18.900 --> 11:19.400


11:19.400 --> 11:19.440


11:19.940 --> 11:20.280


11:20.300 --> 11:22.180


11:30.040 --> 11:30.520


11:30.640 --> 11:30.680


11:48.760 --> 11:52.660
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:08.480 --> 12:13.720
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.080
And here are your hosts.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.180
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lane.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.520
Pick up a copy of Locus, science fiction's leading trade newspaper.

12:27.520 --> 12:32.120
Look inside the front page, and you'll find a small box entitled Editorial Matters.

12:32.260 --> 12:34.860
In the editorial, you'll find, among other acknowledgements,

12:34.980 --> 12:38.280
the names of people who helped collate, fold, and mail the copies of the issue.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.820
We asked Charles Brown, the founder, editor, and publisher of Locus,

12:41.940 --> 12:45.320
to describe how a typical Locus issue is put together prior to mailing.

12:46.140 --> 12:50.420
People who come over to collate Locus, well, it's not collating, it's mailing help.

12:51.340 --> 12:54.020
And we get the issue back from the printer in the afternoon,

12:54.020 --> 12:58.860
and one or two people may show up and help us put stamps on first-class copies.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.640
And then a larger crowd comes in the evening.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.940
You see everybody that's fed dinner and sits around and drinks and puts out, you know,

13:11.120 --> 13:14.880
the little labels on the thing and put them out in order.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.320
And chronological order by zip code.

13:18.320 --> 13:23.560
And they're sacked up, and usually we finish by about 10.30 or 11.

13:23.740 --> 13:26.360
Everybody sits around across the science fiction field.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.420
Very few of the people are what you call fans.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.640
They're almost all writers.

13:33.800 --> 13:39.280
In fact, he had a contest last year for the best first novel by a Locus co-later,

13:39.280 --> 13:41.600
and he did have three nominees.

13:44.120 --> 13:51.240
And as far as I can tell, probably about 90% of the Locuss know it is at least one nominee.

13:51.820 --> 13:56.420
Locuss has grown from a small fanzine to a professionally produced, nearly 50-page-long publication.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.440
We asked Brown if he plans to continue expanding Locuss.

13:59.540 --> 14:00.980
His answer may surprise you.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.660
Actually, I'd like to do the opposite.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.860
I do not want to expand the magazine at all.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.640
If it expands anyway, it always does.

14:08.660 --> 14:13.460
But I have no interest in doing a bigger magazine.

14:14.540 --> 14:18.680
In fact, I find the magazine too big now and circulation too high.

14:20.280 --> 14:25.080
I really want to do a magazine for a limited number of people,

14:25.580 --> 14:27.820
where I can do it all myself at home.

14:29.100 --> 14:35.700
I'm very frightened about getting to the point where I need a large staff and an office and things like that.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.320
Everything is done at home right now.

14:39.860 --> 14:45.880
Some of the changes are always forced on us because there's more news that we feel we have to cover.

14:45.880 --> 14:50.780
As you've probably noticed, we're doing a lot more international coverage lately.

14:53.080 --> 14:57.740
Covering the Soviet Union and European conventions.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.040
And we've had some articles on Chinese science.

15:01.320 --> 15:01.400


15:01.400 --> 15:10.100
And I'm also planning next week to tour, and I'll be at the University of San Francisco.

15:10.420 --> 15:11.120


15:11.340 --> 15:14.600


15:18.960 --> 15:20.400


15:22.640 --> 15:23.060


15:24.300 --> 15:24.760


15:27.200 --> 15:27.860


15:27.860 --> 15:27.940


15:27.940 --> 15:29.620
Locus has caught seven Hugo Awards so far.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.700
Is Brown tiring of winning so many Hugos?

15:32.520 --> 15:34.220
I don't get tired of winning them, no.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.000
It's a lot of fun.

15:38.660 --> 15:41.360
There have been complaints, but they don't get farther with them.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.080
I solve the problem with complaints.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.080
I send Rachel out to pick them up every year.

15:51.380 --> 15:57.440
But I won't say anything as long as people vote for Locus, I'll gladly accept the use

15:57.440 --> 15:57.780
of it.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.520
Locus is a visible presence in the science fiction field.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.780
We asked Brown if it is a target for writers of crackpot letters.

16:05.460 --> 16:11.380
Oh yeah, we get crackpot letters all the time and really strange letters and we usually

16:11.380 --> 16:12.040
try them out.

16:12.800 --> 16:20.460
In years we collected all these really far out letters waiting to publish them on a final

16:20.460 --> 16:20.840
issue.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.040
But it doesn't look like there will ever be a final issue of Locus.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.120
So there's no reason to keep them around anymore.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.960
If you're a serious science fiction fan, you need to be reading Locus.

16:39.100 --> 16:43.520
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science

16:43.520 --> 16:47.780
Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

16:47.780 --> 17:17.760


17:34.540 --> 17:38.520
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:54.420 --> 17:59.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.000
And here are your hosts.

18:08.540 --> 18:10.420
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

18:10.740 --> 18:15.420
The late H. Beam Piper created in this fiction a race of small, furry, sentient creatures called fuzzies.

18:15.420 --> 18:18.220
These cute aliens proved to be very popular with the fans.

18:18.620 --> 18:24.360
Fuzzies figured in only two books, Little Fuzzy and what was later called Fuzzy Sapiens, before Piper died.

18:24.580 --> 18:30.120
But according to Ardath Mayhar, who recently wrote another installment in the Fuzzy saga entitled Golden Dream: A Fuzzy Odyssey,

18:30.380 --> 18:32.620
the Fuzzy series did not stop with Piper's death.

18:33.280 --> 18:42.000
Well, Mr. Piper died in 1966, a suicide, which was a very tragic thing.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.980
And he left a considerable literary estate.

18:47.980 --> 18:51.840
He had been writing rather successfully for a long time.

18:52.860 --> 18:58.900
There was sort of a hiatus there for a number of years until one of his friends,

18:58.980 --> 19:05.920
I believe it was Jerry Pournelle, but I'm not certain, persuaded Ace to purchase his literary estate.

19:05.920 --> 19:11.740
All the rights in all of his books and short stories and everything, which they did.

19:13.500 --> 19:23.040
And they reissued Little Fuzzy and Fuzzy Sapiens in a single volume under the fuzzy papers.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.720
And it was very successful.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.920
Had a built-in market of people who remembered the books.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.400
And so they decided that they wanted another book.

19:32.560 --> 19:40.940
So they turned to Mr. William Tuning, who wrote a third book, Fuzzy Bones, which I enjoyed very much.

19:41.180 --> 19:49.380
I based a great deal of the background of my book on the substructure that he had created for their historical background.

19:50.340 --> 19:54.260
After Tuning's effort, Mayhar told us, she was asked to write a fuzzy novel.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.620
Here she tells us why.

19:56.480 --> 20:02.140
I believe it was Susan Allison, who was then the head science fiction editor at Ace,

20:02.900 --> 20:06.720
decided that they wanted a book from the viewpoint of the little aliens.

20:08.080 --> 20:19.760
Well, my editor had just bought paperback rights to my first two Doubleday books.

20:19.900 --> 20:24.440
And she was in the process of putting them into production for Ace.

20:24.440 --> 20:33.500
And she had had a great deal of back-and-forth conversation with my agent, who is still blackstaggered at how fast I am.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.360
And so one day the phone rang, that dear phone.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.000
It was Susan Allison.

20:39.500 --> 20:46.640
She said, would you be interested in writing a book to continue H. Bean Piper's fuzzy series?

20:46.640 --> 20:47.760
Are you familiar with mine?

20:47.760 --> 20:49.380
And I said, yes, I've got my teeth on them.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.400
And she said, well, would you be interested?

20:51.580 --> 20:54.000
We want one from the viewpoint of the aliens.

20:54.820 --> 21:03.500
And she said, I shouldn't say this, but we were kicking it around the office and trying to figure who was extremely fast and partly alien.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.920
And naturally, we thought of you.

21:05.600 --> 21:10.040
Well, I was flattered, you know, because I am both.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.640
So I said, well, I'll tell you what, I will reread the books.

21:16.700 --> 21:24.360
And then I will write whatever feels comfortable so that I know how well I fit into a fuzzy skin.

21:24.360 --> 21:28.140
And you will be able to tell how well you like what I do.

21:28.660 --> 21:30.100
And then we'll go from there.

21:30.520 --> 21:34.140
To write about fuzzies, Mayhar found it necessary to put herself in their place.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.920
This was nearly February.

21:37.020 --> 21:38.180
So I sat down.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.340
And it's a very funny thing.

21:42.480 --> 21:45.160
Becoming an alien is not all that difficult.

21:45.760 --> 21:50.980
But you have to have been a very peculiar child to be able to do it well.

21:52.140 --> 21:54.980
So I remembered when I was two feet tall.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.480
I can remember back before I was two years old.

21:58.140 --> 21:59.840
I remembered how the world looked.

22:00.040 --> 22:03.640
The world is full of shoes and kneecaps, you know.

22:04.220 --> 22:05.780
Everything is tremendous.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.040
Shrubs are trees.

22:07.220 --> 22:10.120
And trees are just something up there like clouds, you know.

22:10.260 --> 22:19.220
So I shrunk myself down to two feet tall and put myself on a world where everything thought I was delicious.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.080
And went from there.

22:22.960 --> 22:28.320
On our next show, we'll hear more from Ardath Mayhar on her writing of Golden Dream: A Fuzzy Odyssey.

22:35.680 --> 22:41.160
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:41.460 --> 22:44.440
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:04.640 --> 23:14.420


23:33.140 --> 23:37.140
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:52.980 --> 23:58.380
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:01.260 --> 24:02.760
And here are your hosts.

24:07.020 --> 24:08.200
This is Bill Vernon.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.000
And Daryl Lane.

24:09.200 --> 24:12.760
H. Beam Piper's Fuzzy series was only two books long when he died.

24:13.140 --> 24:16.500
William Tuning wrote a third novel in the series called Fuzzy Bones.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.640
Then Ace Books asked Ardath Mayhar to write a fourth novel.

24:19.980 --> 24:24.380
Her continuation of the series, which came out in 1982, was called Golden Dream: A Fuzzy Odyssey,

24:24.380 --> 24:26.180
and it's told from the viewpoint of the fuzzies.

24:26.300 --> 24:32.520
As we learned in our last show, Mayhar used childhood memories to put herself mentally in the place of the two-foot-tall fuzzies.

24:32.860 --> 24:37.100
Mayhar's treatment of the fuzzies diverges quite a bit from the treatments given them by Piper and Tuning, though.

24:37.100 --> 24:47.380
The treatment of the fuzzies in both the Piper and Tuning books is rather peripheral to the human story,

24:47.380 --> 24:55.000
and the fuzzies are given rather short shrift as sort of cutesy-poo creatures.

24:55.740 --> 25:04.380
Okay, Mr. Tuning had set up that they had survived on this totally inimical planet for 1,200 years.

25:05.160 --> 25:10.320
So little helpless big-eyed cutesy-poos don't survive for 1,200 years.

25:10.500 --> 25:15.000
You've got to have pretty bright gritty little cats, or they're not going to make it.

25:25.960 --> 25:30.900
Mayhar also took the approach of answering some of the mysteries at which Piper and Tuning had only hinted.

25:31.480 --> 25:39.240
Well, I had some awfully neat questions to answer that had been set up in the other books

25:39.240 --> 25:42.360
and had never been addressed in those books.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.100
Why did they speak in ultrasonics?

25:47.140 --> 25:56.380
Why, being obviously rational creatures capable of great affection, were they sexually promiscuous?

25:57.560 --> 26:02.920
Oh, there were any number of questions that I had to answer.

26:03.000 --> 26:09.120
It was so funny because as I went, I just turned, okay, this is what they are,

26:09.120 --> 26:13.220
and I turned around and looked, and this is obviously the reason they were that way.

26:13.620 --> 26:19.720
They were sexually promiscuous, for instance, because when their spaceship crashed,

26:20.840 --> 26:24.700
a complement of only some 400 were aboard,

26:25.520 --> 26:30.280
and some half of those were subsequently killed in an earthquake.

26:30.280 --> 26:37.660
So you had a gene pool shared among something around 150 or 200 individuals.

26:38.140 --> 26:43.660
You had to spread your genetic heritage around,

26:43.920 --> 26:50.440
and so this would be a natural outgrowth of assigned breeding as long as they were in the original valley,

26:50.440 --> 26:56.160
and then when they went out, they retained this imperative from their leaders,

26:56.160 --> 26:58.980
you must do this for racial survival.

26:59.260 --> 27:02.200
There were any number of things like that.

27:02.440 --> 27:06.800
One of the reasons Mayhar was asked to write a fuzzy novel was that she could write at such a rapid pace.

27:07.300 --> 27:09.620
Ace needed the book as soon as they could get their hands on it.

27:10.080 --> 27:13.240
Here Mayhar comments on the production of Golden Dream: A Fuzzy Odyssey.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.020
Anyhow, they loved what I did.

27:16.180 --> 27:17.280
I loved what I did.

27:17.660 --> 27:20.500
I wrote that book, 100,000 words, in six weeks.

27:22.780 --> 27:24.960
I sat on a wicker stool,

27:25.780 --> 27:29.260
which is now permanently imprinted on my derriere.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.580
My husband would come in.

27:35.660 --> 27:38.340
He would have left me sitting on the stool that morning.

27:38.620 --> 27:40.720
He'd come in that evening and say,

27:40.720 --> 27:43.180
You haven't eaten, have you?

27:43.760 --> 27:44.160
I'd say,

27:44.700 --> 27:45.020
Eaten?

27:45.240 --> 27:45.920
What's eaten?

27:48.180 --> 27:50.300
But it was a lot of fun.

27:50.540 --> 27:54.560
Both the trade edition and the mass market edition of Golden Dream: A Fuzzy Odyssey,

27:54.800 --> 27:57.220
featured the same stunning Michael Whalen cover.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.360
We asked Mayhar if she had any input.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.260
No, but I knew it was going to be beautiful

28:02.260 --> 28:08.120
because Mike Whalen had done the covers for the Piper books and for the tuning book,

28:08.280 --> 28:10.020
and so I knew what he could do.

28:10.020 --> 28:12.760
We wondered if Mayhar would be willing to write another fuzzy novel.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.080
I just wouldn't mind at all writing another one.

28:16.260 --> 28:17.680
They're nice little people.

28:17.860 --> 28:18.600
They really are.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.700
On some of our future shows,

28:20.700 --> 28:23.280
we'll talk more with Ardath Mayhar about her other fiction.

28:30.460 --> 28:33.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

28:33.260 --> 28:36.060
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

28:36.380 --> 28:39.420
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:59.020 --> 29:01.820


29:01.820 --> 29:02.000
