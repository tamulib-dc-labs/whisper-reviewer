00:03.136 --> 00:20.631
The introduction that you just heard is heard of Lee Edmunds, his portable synthesiser, and David Greene also

00:03.136 --> 00:20.631
helped. I think it's sort of traditional by starting behind time, with 10 minutes behind time, that we hope to catch up. 
Which of the next panel? Well, I would sort of like to as coordinator of the chairman, Paul Stokes, never having attended

00:33.730 --> 00:45.665
a science fiction convention before, sort of wanted me to introduce the convention, since I have attended a few. And so 
I'd just sort of like to give the welcome to everyone, everyone that's come from the state of the 12th Australian Science

00:45.685 --> 00:52.954
Fiction Convention. And this is in fact the first Australian convention to be held in another state outside of Sydney or 
Melbourne. And

01:03.582 --> 01:08.286
I suppose this is some sort of a third. And, well, I think at this stage, the first of all, I should introduce our guest of 
honor, which is John Follister, who's the...

01:10.609 --> 01:30.147
And the, well, the man is going to be sort of introducing a lot of the Paul Stokes on my next... The

01:32.101 --> 01:47.145
little fellow in the corner at the tape recorder is Rod Hannah and

01:32.101 --> 01:47.145
he's told me that he doesn't want anyone to touch the expensive equipment over there. So don't touch him.

01:50.971 --> 01:54.497
Responsible for the film is John Hewitt on my right.

01:57.548 --> 02:03.296
And the guy that's going to give you some music this afternoon is Mike Clarke in the blue on my right.

02:08.222 --> 02:11.446
Well, there's other people that you're going to meet during the convention. People like Jeff Harris who's sitting down 
at the front. And some of his helpers, namely Joy Window. I think the only other committee member here at the moment

02:27.738 --> 02:31.564
responsible for the auction is Poul Anderson up near the bank.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.955
Well, at this stage we've got a few announcements to make. First of all, anyone that hasn't collected banquet tickets 
should go down and see Gary Mason some stage afternoon. And also anyone that wants to go to the banquet and hasn't bought a

02:48.009 --> 02:54.859
ticket should go down and see him because they're selling fast. and we've got a limit of 40 attending the banquet, and 
it's almost full up, I believe. I've also been informed by Lincoln College people that cars should not be parked out in

03:04.224 --> 03:13.457
the alcove down there. In fact, they should be left in the street, apparently. Also, there's a coach machine at the back 
of the room, which is 10 cents. There's a coffee machine as well, which should be operating.

03:33.699 --> 03:35.982
And there is one alteration in the program. At 6.30pm

03:36.002 --> 03:47.376
John Breeden's comic slides has been changed to sometime after the awards banquet. And I think that's the only 
alteration at the moment. Something without further ado we'll call the past two, which is just on time. Start with the

04:02.440 --> 04:04.025
panel. If Daleks do, why don't you? Which is going to be introduced by John Hewitt and Paul Stakes. One small 
announcement. Don't go touching the film screen. It's hanging by hair at the moment. I'd rather it didn't fall down.

04:22.472 --> 04:26.457
We'll draw you into the conversation or use it as an other step. Right. Go ahead. Ah, shit works. Ah. Good afternoon. With 
the ever-growing permission in our society, we have decided that it's time that we looked at sex in science fiction. All

04:45.958 --> 04:46.539
right, go on. Well, we're going to read some example packages from various books I've picked out but I see there are 
children in the audience. No, we won't. We will, however, discuss various aspects of sex and science fiction over the

04:58.027 --> 05:03.793
years. I can't think of

05:03.833 --> 05:13.702
any. Why don't you tell us about some of the books you've been reading in the last week? Yeah, so I've been borrowing a 
large number of books from Alan and plowing my way through them. Things like The Standing Joy by Wyman Gwynne.

05:28.638 --> 05:30.802
The Book of Skulls by Robert Silverberg. Didn't quite finish that one, it's rather dull. Productions of Time by John 
Brunner. I might as well start discussing some writer's aspects to sex. I'll start with Silverberg, I imagine over here

05:45.586 --> 05:51.135
somewhere.

05:55.790 --> 05:59.033
I guess there are various ways you can look at sex and science fiction. You can have either, in dividing the categories, 
you can have either sexual customs in a future society, totally alien forms of sex, sex recognizable forms of sex on an

05:59.053 --> 06:15.050
alien, and various aspects like this. And then again there's just normal Almost normal sex introduced into a science 
fiction book just not really as part of the plot. In the book of Skulls by Silverberg, he depicts sex in a future society.

06:37.791 --> 06:41.674
They're allowed to know not so far in the future. Four young men go looking for immortality. The sex in it is I guess, more 
or less, the way sex is in New York nowadays. A very casual you go along, you pick up a member of the opposite sex for the

06:54.607 --> 06:58.894
night. Yeah, that's it. But surely he's just sort of introduced sex into this book because it's sort of contemporary. 
And then he's just sort of wanting to sell the book, put a bit of sex into the box and not really relevant to the plotters.

07:11.193 --> 07:14.197
Not really. Moving along. Moving right along the world inside. This is the one I meant to pick up in the first place. In 
this, there are a large number of people, e.g. something like a million people living in one building, two miles high.

07:27.255 --> 07:32.825
Now, fairly obvious sexual customs in a society like that are going to be much different. In this case,

07:37.208 --> 07:40.011
There exists almost a society of free love. Anyone can walk in your front door and demand a sleep with your wife and you 
can't say no.

07:48.118 --> 07:56.125
Whether, I think, although he seems to indicate in the book that most people go along with this, I don't think anyone 
really agrees with it. There still exist forms of jealousy. Nice place to visit but you wouldn't want to live there I

07:59.688 --> 08:01.830
suppose. True. I'd say it would be better. I think in the world inside The free-love aspect is freely accepted by the 
majority of people. Not so. There's one character in it who was very jealous about his wife. There's one character out of

08:17.328 --> 08:19.631
how many millions? Well, it still was very right in the book about a typical group of people inside the building. I think 
he did. I think he wrote the book about a typical part of future society.

08:37.267 --> 08:52.111
Yeah, but it seemed to me on reading it, I guess it was just personal impression that there wasn't anyone in it who 
subconsciously really liked other people walking the front door and sleeping with their wife. I mean, he doesn't say

08:52.291 --> 08:54.735
it. And those people are people in particular positions. One is fairly high in administrative ranks. One is a historian 
studying sex customs in the 20th century. One's a musician. Don't you think that in this book, the world inside, despite

09:13.784 --> 09:38.661
sort of being presumably tolerant towards sex, they aren't really tolerant towards sort of abnormal human behaviour 
and that everyone says cramped that they've got to sort of tolerate one another and sort of like the guy in that book was

09:13.784 --> 09:38.661
cast out and he was finally, he was killed, so... Yeah, one chap had to leave the society, but... Well, despite being sort 
of liberal in one respect, they sort of turned out to be It was not really free love in that case, it was enforced. You know,

09:43.036 --> 09:44.140
you have to go out. Well, it looks like a free love society on the surface, but as I said, I don't think any of them really... 
like people walking in and saying, you know, I want your wife at some stage. That I seem to be walking somewhere else and

09:58.584 --> 10:11.461
saying, I'd like your wife. He was only one character in a small chapter of the book. I'd think he more of the historian 
here. I think he actually objected to other people sleeping with his wife. I just have a question. In Pondland town,

10:25.621 --> 10:28.125
there's two dollars to one of you. What do I have in my life right now? And there's two dollars. Well, we only have one 
dollar, but that's

10:34.957 --> 10:42.229
the whole thing. I think I came up with that phrase at the committee meeting. It was just because it rhymed well that we 
decided to. I mean, you know, it seemed a better title.

11:05.952 --> 11:10.357
The man inside the Dalek probably enjoys it. The

11:10.557 --> 11:19.186
Dalek's perspective is that there's a party and a court. And

11:19.206 --> 11:23.030
there's that discussion over there. So the Dalek's perspective is generally like, I think I just, um, clean

11:23.050 --> 11:35.824
the brain I'm

11:36.479 --> 11:43.870
afraid you've had to remove the sexual organs on our tail, like they're going on TV.

11:50.380 --> 11:51.601
Anyway, moving right along. You sort of want to comment on the fact that sort of every sexual interlude in a silverberg 
will sort of breathe like every other. Silverberg. In other words, there's a world inside the section that reads

12:02.980 --> 12:16.957
exactly the same as in The Son of Man, which is exactly the same as in Time of Changes.

12:17.017 --> 12:22.223
It gets to the stage where it's just like railway carriages coupling and uncoupling. There's not to be mechanical about 
it. Well, I seem to have had that light anyway. Yes. Oh,

12:33.862 --> 12:40.894
God. I thought you were a junior member. I think it's going to be his books. I think it would make quite a case that he's 
probably the most prurient writer in the fiction. He really seems to draw a second world wall just to use them. Quite

13:01.220 --> 13:03.523
ordinary science fiction novels. I thought it was joking serious when you write that text. In simple words it says, in 
this term, you know, free love, whatever it means, that there's a difference in the length

13:06.808 --> 13:20.449
of the text.

13:23.737 --> 13:36.126
I don't think it helps

13:23.737 --> 13:36.126
the narrative. And

13:36.916 --> 14:01.962
of

13:36.916 --> 14:01.962
course some of his stuff was published in Ted White's amazing and sort of using trendy, all that words in amazing things 
like the second trip which is another silverberg book It sort of caused quite a few, or apparently, when it was

14:02.785 --> 14:06.390
published. Well, they kiddie's magazines. You can't put more than a word into the paperback market. It's supposed to be 
different. But, I mean, you just pick up every five, six magazines and you know that there's ain't that much audience,

14:15.384 --> 14:22.435
except Reynolds perhaps. Yeah, we hear from the adolescents, yes. Yeah,

14:26.292 --> 14:41.672
I

14:26.292 --> 14:41.672
agree with you that Silverberg's sex is very tedious, or at least I think it is. Son of a man, I don't think I read more than a 
third of the book before I gave up. I just found that it's nearly all totally unrealistic sex and it just didn't mean

14:45.797 --> 14:51.304
anything to me. Shall we move on to discuss someone else? How about Phil Farmer? This is the only book of Phil Farmer I've 
ever read. I've only read about the first chapter in which he has a woman.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.001
Time stop. Are you aware that farmers can write the first few pages of that? Oh, well, no wonder. I didn't read the 
article. No, I thought the girls were just getting ripped off and all that sort of thing. Yeah, yeah. Well, that appeared

15:24.457 --> 15:31.167
in the vegan edition that the series of 60 pages of that article was removed from the late 50s. And the editors always 
wrote an introductory chapter It's not in the original edition of Mock and Run in the magazine. Yes, and the only one they

15:51.190 --> 16:07.008
didn't have to write in production, too, was either Flesh, or it could have been a boy. Well, there's only one type of 
A-type, which they did not have to write as juic-y as an example.

16:22.983 --> 16:34.163
Actually, I don't think this time stop is a very good example of Philip Jose Farmer's work, which includes Sex and 
Science Fiction, because I think it's one of his most boring books. Probably one of the... I can't say that bad. Time

16:40.594 --> 16:40.995
stop? I think it was possibly one of the three best books. Well, I haven't read it in my years. Can we get back to that?

17:07.313 --> 17:18.290
Well written but I think it's still rather boring compared to some things like the Riverwald series.

17:23.899 --> 17:29.046
What would you consider Lord Tiger's science fiction? I haven't read it. I don't know.

17:39.562 --> 17:44.498
It's

17:39.562 --> 17:44.498
fine. It's fine.

17:52.218 --> 18:04.749
Then again, Farmer seems to have sold out from writing a genuine sort of science fiction novel with alien sex ideas, 
something like The Lovers, and he's sort of gone on to disrupt pornographic novels for Essex House. Have you read any of

18:04.769 --> 18:09.533
the so-called pornographic novels you've read yet? No, I have actually, yes. I think they're far better than The 
Lovers, and far better than anything that he's done in sex with everybody. Well,

18:18.221 --> 18:21.904
I suppose they're sort of... Yeah. I'll

18:22.373 --> 18:34.832
say

18:22.373 --> 18:34.832
something about John Boyd. I just, a couple of weeks ago, I read Sex and High Command just particularly from this panel. I 
don't think Boyd has any idea whatsoever about what sex is about. Well, the idea

18:49.407 --> 19:10.875
of this is

18:49.407 --> 19:10.875
that

19:11.817 --> 19:20.207
women in the world get hold of something, which is a substitute for their normal sex life, something called vital alert. 
does away with men apparently they shove it up there, wipes it, and gives them a big kiss. They're called

19:27.803 --> 19:36.234
V-bombs, aren't they? Apparently, somehow, it also causes fertilization, you know, doing away with men completely. 
And I found that the men in this book were totally emasculated. Don't know. When women refuse them, they're totally

19:48.470 --> 19:54.526
incapable of doing anything about it. In general, from what I've read of Boyd, Either his heroes are superstars, you 
know, they go through so many women that's unrealistic, or else they just can't approach a woman at all. I don't think

20:09.528 --> 20:20.244
there's a single man of male character I've come across in a boyd novel who has what I consider to be a normal healthy sex 
life. In this, when the, you know, the men, the women review their men, the men just don't do anything about it. They're

20:27.955 --> 20:30.559
totally incapable of doing anything about it. The average guy would rape his wife if she said no, or divorce her one or the 
other. You're talking about it just in terms of sex and not getting sex, but what about in science fiction aspects? This

20:46.754 --> 20:57.030
is supposed to be a future society where women, you know, mentally don't feel they don't require men anymore, and they 
now physically don't require men anymore. I mean, you know, the men seem to have grown up with a gigantic inferiority

20:57.711 --> 21:03.239
complex, so they're not good for anything. You know, it's the type of thing, you know, and they just... other natural 
selection dying off, you know, the weakest to surviving because they're the most servile, anybody who's any threat is

21:08.103 --> 21:21.657
done away with.

21:24.218 --> 21:39.612
So, can you give us some suggestions

21:24.218 --> 21:39.612
as well? Boy who committed suicide, because if you remember, four went to find a mortality and only two could have. One 
had to voluntarily die, one had to be killed. When the guy who voluntarily died, how do you realise he had a life of a

21:52.908 --> 22:03.761
homosexual? What an awful cliché, isn't it? It wasn't absolutely necessary. They could have got any character as 
mentally unstable committed

22:11.884 --> 22:19.674
suicide.

22:23.339 --> 22:30.588
I think it would be a bit unusual that out of four people, two of them are actually have homosexual tendencies. In that, 
one of the characters, and this is, well, not strictly homosexual, he's bisexual. Well, perhaps, I don't know if I'm

22:38.907 --> 22:46.479
going to wait until I've raised it, but could you find some good examples of sex and time, if you can? Sure, there must be 
some.

22:50.405 --> 22:57.837
Well, Robert Heinlein's Glory Road, I think is the main character in this, has a reasonable approach to sex. It seems to me 
to be the approach of a typical army soldier. you know, have it where you can find it. But surely that's a cop-out, John,

23:08.253 --> 23:12.639
it's a fun book. True, true. It's just, you know, it's a recountable book, or it's improved on it. The only effect is that 
it has a lot of fun effects, you know, and you can have a good laugh about it. Surely it's one of the shortcomings as far as

23:21.273 --> 23:25.018
you can edit it. The fun effect is, you know, permissible. It's the first thing good. It wasn't any fix on stage in Glory 
Road anyway. It was all sort of delayed until after the end of the chapter or something. He even sort of copped out when we

23:35.236 --> 23:42.500
were sort of showing some girls to have sex with and they turned out to be looking too young. I don't think he was really 
realistic in that respect. No, I don't really think so.

23:58.922 --> 24:09.057
Actually,

23:58.922 --> 24:09.057
the Old Piano Evil is a more recent one, which is called Timing Up for Love. which in fact deals with infest and he's sort of 
having with his mother and his sisters and everyone in the dog and he sort of, yeah. Since you're about the only one who's

24:17.558 --> 24:19.162
read it. He's getting on to that. He's getting to be a real dirty old man, I'm afraid. Yeah. Yeah, you can see that in 
Heinlein you can see the, you know, graduation after about 1960 you never touch sex, apart from saying, girl, the woman,

24:24.815 --> 24:34.884
cuddly. After that, you know, get books which are typical of Glory Road, in which it's known that the hero sleeps with the 
woman, but they're no, you know, explicit sex, or anything, from what you say in the latest books. But even in the latest

24:49.416 --> 24:54.400
one, it's still sexual fun, so he doesn't really want to get too serious. I think he had a sort of something, you know, 
about his mother though. It's a time travel story and the character goes back and falls in love with his mother. He was a

25:09.062 --> 25:10.563
good food cook. Pardon? All you zombies. That's very similar. His own father and mother. What's the point?

25:25.480 --> 25:46.712
We're going to get to the point...

25:25.480 --> 25:46.712
...But it has a very nice t-shirt. I'm just wondering if you could get at it for a second. I've got the number about six.

25:50.360 --> 26:12.125
That's right. I've got about six numbers before. I don't think this is perhaps where someone's fiction is working... I don't think this is like the Sturgeon story of all being my brothers, which you wouldn't 
want to marry your sister, in that description of the world. But even then, he was coy and avoided the use of

26:21.607 --> 26:29.980
the word... uses. One thing, you've got a sort of distinguish between sort of novels striving to be just sort of 
trendy in that, by including sex scenes and sort of stories that you're sort of talking about, like Ted Sturgeon's

26:30.821 --> 26:47.546
earlier stuff, which does include sex. Is that sort of an inherent part of the plot? I think more than human is another 
interesting event. Sort of a guest alt then. Sort of some reasonably realistic descriptions of what I thought to be sort

27:02.219 --> 27:10.367
of reasonable people and characterizations. Especially the, I think, 803 novel there.

27:22.373 --> 27:47.976
I think that

27:22.373 --> 27:47.976
I would

27:22.373 --> 27:47.976
actually

27:22.373 --> 27:47.976
just

27:48.428 --> 27:59.787
Two people say that a lonely one is way together, especially a sort of alien being.

27:59.967 --> 28:12.208
They're obviously attracted to one another, so why

27:59.967 --> 28:12.208
not? Well there's another aspect of sex and this is alien sex which is totally unrealistic, e.g. supposing a race which 
has six different sexes. I personally can't recall anything, having read anything even like this, I don't know if

28:23.786 --> 28:31.817
anyone in the audience has.

28:32.303 --> 28:37.151
I don't know how he worked at the house. He did what? What have you got? Supersection, subsection, and intersection. 
You've got only most of that cut. Intersection? Break it down. English? How about the Sheldon, the boring sex group who

28:44.764 --> 28:56.944
would

28:44.764 --> 28:56.944
have a problem? Yes, I can look at the way. If you've done one for two points and think that you better have children that 
haven't been involved for three hours ago, please run home and take children. Mine was over 16. And I think that if you

29:13.120 --> 29:17.985
don't have all these people, then you never get rid of them. I don't know, of course. If you don't, I'll take you. That's 
right, I'll make one for you. Because we're in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, of course. What's the plan for the 21st day? We

29:27.468 --> 29:30.752
would. Actually, Jeff, I think there are many sectors that there are people who can start with that. And that's very 
contentious.

29:41.026 --> 29:41.547
We would. At the end of all, I'm a little happy to say that the various versions when you get out of the table, please take a 
look at that. Please take a look down at the line or not. What do you get, though? Oh, I think I'll have to go to the hospital.

30:00.758 --> 30:01.521
No, I'm just kidding. I have, uh... If it's all he has in mind, it's sort of not a very good example to take.

30:33.128 --> 30:51.976
We're going to talk about Shakespeare, but I don't

30:33.128 --> 30:51.976
know Shakespeare is one of them. Yes, I have. I thought I asked that a while ago. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I don't need that so 
much. Actually,

31:11.873 --> 31:35.535
you know, if everyone's talking about a boy, sort of no one's mentioned one of his novels, which I think is rather 
amusing, it's all about sex rackles of heaven. in, I think, this novel more than any, sort of, get the idea that Boyd's

31:35.887 --> 31:46.656
having everyone on anyway and sort of can't really believe his characters because he doesn't believe in himself. The 
reason for this is the character. It's a trick when you're not a very good writer to begin society across the right from

31:48.702 --> 31:55.658
the left. And I'd say on the right from the left, it's sort of unreal, but that's not the case in my judgment. On the other 
hand, I think that's the last 40 pages of the pollinated debate. As good as, if not better, anything that their students

32:06.481 --> 32:22.644
don't look similar, you know, as opposed to the... the rest of it, the book is pretty bad, but that's why I'm 
thinking of the playwright and we're taking the woman away. It's very, very well done. It just goes to show, I proved my

32:23.806 --> 32:31.056
earlier point that these characters don't have a still-done-can't-approach-a-normal-sex relationship. They've 
got to do it via a file. I think it's a more sexual nature than, you know, you're getting what they're the right thing to do.

32:41.245 --> 32:41.445
All right. Be careful, John. It's a phrase that usually brings out what he's written. But you know how he's getting this 
phrase like normal sexual relationship when you're discussing the bizarre sexual relationship, so it's not a

32:46.713 --> 32:57.008
fiction. It's not a fiction, it's about the normal. Yes, he's kind of quiet, I think. It is very, very ageing in the 
farming world. Now, the ethnic household images of these could not have been written without the wild and weird sexual

33:05.115 --> 33:15.993
imagination poured into it. And because it doesn't have any of the restrictions of the science fiction sphere, he could 
really, pardon the phrase, let's go. In some

33:27.346 --> 33:51.683
way I think you've got to define a good sex relation and I suppose that is one that you enjoy without... one that your 
partner would enjoy and you wouldn't have any guilt feelings or complexes about it. You'd have a hell of a time being

33:51.950 --> 33:58.753
called a romanticist. Yeah,

33:59.459 --> 34:16.915
but that's part of the enjoyment

33:59.459 --> 34:16.915
side, I guess. OK, I'll try.

34:29.446 --> 34:44.588
You

34:29.446 --> 34:44.588
know, okay, you're speaking about sort of abnormal or this sort of different sort of sex relationships, not about the 
relationship that the character in the Ellison story has to his dog. If anyone's read this story, is this sort of a love

34:45.409 --> 34:50.436
story or what would you consider that? Well, not a whole lot of it, they're both in the top story. You may recall that 
Sturgeon went to find a conversion Has any one thing done to the explosion of all others and that includes the

34:59.467 --> 35:05.758
missionary position? This helps to do when we talk about normal station life.

35:14.313 --> 35:14.754
Calmly? What's

35:15.075 --> 35:18.701
the missionary position? We've done it with the missionary.

35:22.670 --> 35:26.755
They're talking about alien sex, what about in the film Strange Relations? There's a series of stories in that, and 
there's one chap in there who has been married to numerous aliens,

35:27.216 --> 35:39.713
as he travels throughout the galaxy. There's a spider woman, an octopus woman. There's another one, a giant blob, which 
molds itself around him. And I think he finally gets trapped inside some giant snail or something like that. Who would

35:52.319 --> 35:55.822
you classify that in? Well, they have stories about death. And of course, in them, power explores the protagonist's 
relationship to his mother, to his sisters. Each year, since I've written stories, I've already tried to tell some of

36:07.774 --> 36:15.401
them. They're sort of psychological fantasies, they're extremely Freudian. And they are about, say, they're not 
about normal, sexual relationships.

36:28.329 --> 36:37.599
And certainly in two of those relationships, for example, he's doing a whole lot of wishful thoughts. I mean, he's 
writing about what he's doing. He's really playing out sexual activities, you know. He's just, wow, feeling about it,

36:42.385 --> 37:11.213
you know. It's the same as a part of an Australian-Israelan plan. You get so excited over that. Boy and girl scouts next to 
them, you know, you know, they swap around, and you're like, terrific...Would you write that it's good sex and science fiction, or good sexual science fiction? I wouldn't use a label

37:18.562 --> 37:19.964
like that. I would say that it's an interesting science fiction story that explores various sexual attitudes and 
relationships on

37:20.584 --> 37:31.298
a psychological level. I think that there was one open to me, my sister. which has been found in science fiction, that was 
probably the last in those particular series, which was almost a precursor of the Essex house novel, which had the great

37:36.050 --> 37:55.476
long, snake-like thing going down the hero's mouth, which you may know before. Of course, you know, there's a 
world-removement of Silverberg's house, where he is just injecting sexual relationships into his stories to juice

37:55.676 --> 38:05.770
them up. Well,

38:06.323 --> 38:22.711
would you say that you're saying that Silverberg and Jack's sexual relationships and their stories, would you say that 
Compton does the same thing in one of his stories? Well, there's always Jack's Silverberg's stories, his things thrown

38:22.751 --> 38:29.563
in. It seems to have some great filing system of characters and actions and reactions

38:29.543 --> 38:46.995
and emotions.

38:48.798 --> 38:51.041
He doesn't have to be trained in a random chapter. There's no real feeling at all. So naturally the 16s don't work, 
because they're dragged in, and all the other ones, like the homosexuals, they're dragged in, you know. They're all

39:00.552 --> 39:06.419
taken out of sexuality, the guys have to kill themselves, you know. There's no real conviction, I can't believe in any of 
those writings. I tried reading the second trip recently, about 50 pages to a journey. He's shrieking so loudly. sort of

39:18.481 --> 39:25.909
you read one and you read them all especially with the sex scenes.

39:30.412 --> 39:42.133
Perhaps something we haven't discussed yet is perhaps we have briefly in the world inside of the society in which sex is 
governed, controlled, e.g. in the wanting seed by Anthony Burgess. The main theme of this book is that because of

39:46.320 --> 39:51.930
overpopulation the government is advocating and encouraging homosexuality and castration and anything in fact to 
limit births.

40:06.895 --> 40:08.658
Do you think I've got any comments? No, it doesn't work. The populace eventually rejects it. That's usual. In one way or 
another. The whole society breaks down. So in fact they start eating each other. Do you think sooner or later... The

40:28.917 --> 40:43.247
panel reads the written article, which I've written about, I think, about the getting of events in science fiction. on 
the external population problem, and that's a very good line, where it's just something that the whole problem was

40:43.514 --> 40:57.117
trying to suppress in so-called unnatural aspects over the years. It's so natural, in terms of, for instance, He

41:02.448 --> 41:19.815
was just saying that anything really unnatural was sort of something like a poor side of a triangle or something like 
that. You know, nothing but the barrens, the trims, the feathers, all the castings there. You know, it's unnatural.

41:28.706 --> 41:29.687
They think people do it. Well, it's natural, yeah. Well, by definition, it's natural. Well, it's something unnatural, 
sort of like flying without wings. That's what he was getting at. If people do it, it should be there. We should be there.

41:41.404 --> 41:42.766
People, by definition, be natural. Well, I think the engine is quite a mess. Perhaps,

41:50.137 --> 42:05.709
since we had a question about Supergirl a while ago, I might recall talking about Larry Niven's article on Superman and 
his sexual life.

42:05.830 --> 42:09.377
It's all a myriad of ways. The

42:09.357 --> 42:27.990
very favorite man is a man of steel and he should have no real control over the exceptional act made for Stardes. going to 
rip the women, the woman apart the minute he starts making love to her. And yes. And

42:36.308 --> 42:44.922
what is playing in the film? Is it a super dog or is it a super dog? It's a super dog. It's a super dog. It's a super dog. It's a 
super dog.

42:57.586 --> 43:02.491
No, they have serious side effects.

43:02.611 --> 43:50.847
I can't believe...How do we do it? I don't know if

43:54.376 --> 44:10.795
you've got one John Brunner's in Productions of Parliament, do you want to mention that one? Yes, we can just cast John 
Brunner for a while. We've still got 20 minutes if you will.

44:19.345 --> 44:31.881
The idea of this book, while they don't actually have any explicit sex in it, is that people from the future like to sort of 
take thrills. What kind of kisses? You know, sort of, you know, pluck yourself in and have a thrill that someone else has

44:33.523 --> 44:39.811
experienced. And they get together a bloke who's keen on pornography, a drug addict, a bloke who's was an alcoholic, now 
recovered, but can't touch the stuff. Homosexual, lesbian, throws them all together and tries to get some good stuff on

44:52.826 --> 45:03.759
tape for people in the future to enjoy.

45:07.323 --> 45:09.405
Comments? I think there's another one that's run as a novel where he's dealing with sexual perversions. I think 
possibly it's a little bit like Silverberg and he's just tossing these things in and just for the readers entertainment

45:19.066 --> 45:30.499
and sort of it doesn't read that well anyway. The general theme of this book, I mean the whole theme of the book is sort of 
wrapped around this plot of perversions but Brunner seems to shy away from actual sex scenes. His sex is more or less

45:45.475 --> 45:53.917
indirect, although he doesn't seem to write it into the plot a lot better than some other writers. He makes, you know, 
it's necessary it comes in. So, look, let's get off John Brunner. Let's talk about the six things in there. Is anyone sort

46:06.450 --> 46:12.335
of ready, uh, six things and half of Clark's books? Yeah. Yes, he is. Yeah. Oh, what's that? It's a red full of six things 
and all the signs, which it is. It's a full of wind. Oh, yeah. Uh, move it. Uh, the place you call Moonland of the East down

46:26.448 --> 46:40.809
into this so-called lunar dust, and at one stage, a very noble, uh, city technician or something goes for it, or 
somewhere, which is similar to where it was. And when they come back, all it has to do is go in one more lane, one more lane,

46:41.210 --> 46:48.000
and he says, hmm, they have been thinking, not before, And I can think it will do it. It's embarrassing to hear a little 
written. On the other hand, has the panel read a sense into it by D.G. Comfort? Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. About sexuality and

47:05.943 --> 47:11.391
sexuality in particular. From what level? From a short story of Frederik Pohl called Daimler. From what I've read of 
Compton, which isn't very much, it seemed to me that he always liked to make sex appear dirty and something that should be

47:17.478 --> 47:28.180
hidden away. I'm not hidden away, but he likes to make it appear dirty and something that you feel revolved with. I think 
it'så

47:33.290 --> 47:51.670
very real and that's why many people didn't expect it. Perhaps it appeared

47:52.088 --> 48:05.003
to me that his character is just a period dirty, none of them. I wouldn't be friends with any old ones, they really 
existed. And the radio is just very bright now. And it does feel this way. I mean, if you vomit, it's a toilet rather than a

48:19.290 --> 48:25.487
drink in front of a husband. Well, on the other hand, there's lots of jolly good sex in chronicles. Well, you just, you 
know, if you fancy someone, you can just say, how about it? Well, together, I think 30 or 30 in chronicles is a

48:34.391 --> 48:50.430
tremendously moving sequence through the circuit, when being up forcibly makes love to the, you know, ladies and 
gentlemen, question. I suppose you can see that already. That was the one I was thinking of, actually. Yes, well, as I

48:53.294 --> 48:59.845
said, there is a distinction between aggressive, love-making, and rape. It's a very subtle one sometimes in fiction. 
But I've found that particular scene extremely moving in the very opposite of the characters, certainly not 30s and

49:05.194 --> 49:13.107
90s. Once again, that's a big difference. But maybe I'm doing it all the time. Speaking

49:19.552 --> 49:28.886
of putting the experiences on tape, there was a good eight-paper back a few years ago. I think there was a big ball of wax, 
wasn't it? Where they feed signals directly into the brain and they're bypassing the whole problem and direct effects

49:32.712 --> 49:44.609
in the head as it is. It was all in the imagination anyway, I think. all these sort of versions you can have, you can have a 
trip all the way up to where they, you know. I reckon, for reason-wise, I've come down to the north a little, quite a lot of

49:56.838 --> 50:07.150
the times, it's like, the way it matters, the depth of it. Would be. For depth. That was right to mine, too. You saw that? I 
know the books. Yeah. I want

50:18.117 --> 50:25.592
to do that, but I can't do that. I need to think. I need to think. I need to get this one done.

50:38.493 --> 50:49.184
You

50:38.493 --> 50:49.184
know, it's a sort of... Call it television. Not what it means to be sick. Quite literally, I've opened all sorts of 
possibilities. It's just up to the guy's imagination. They can do anything if it's all in the brain, isn't it? I was sort

50:59.295 --> 51:08.044
of giving him sexual experiences from his childhood, and there was some very effective sex themes in that book, 
actually. I'm going to talk a little bit about what I think is the sake in long distance against the Iron Train. The reason

51:17.811 --> 51:24.180
why we can do the sake is because Longdale has the whole thing in general. It's great to be able to do the sake. I'm glad to 
hear the sake. You read too much of that afterwards. Michael Morcox describes his so-called source and sourcing novel

51:31.024 --> 51:39.074
as pure text novels. But it's in his imagery and all his subliminal techniques, there's one which he has described and 
it's just a very long night of love. Of course, in the process, people had each other dead, the actions they played over

51:48.345 --> 51:53.792
two years. but all he was trying to transform the coin was to move up a little bit better. But reproduced in a surrealistic 
fashion, I have a good feeling that, you know, with most topology, which puts us there. It's one of the early storm

52:14.969 --> 52:16.671
bringer books. It was the second one. It was the second one. It was the second one. Of

52:22.510 --> 52:47.134
course

52:22.510 --> 52:47.134
behold the man as the sort of sex and that realistic sex of the character masturbating at childhood and who goes back 
three times. What?

52:58.792 --> 53:00.615
Yeah. Yeah, but they're late on work. What page? Actually, yeah, I'm just talking about symbolical sex. What about the 
story in, I think it was quark number two, where the preparation of one's beloved for dinner. Which is a, you know, a nice

53:15.495 --> 53:17.238
love story. Which the young woman is told how to prepare her boyfriend for supper. Sort of three things. Really good. 
Really good, isn't it? Yes.

53:40.019 --> 53:41.623
Of course. I don't know, but don't poke your dally's

53:42.177 --> 53:52.767
in your play home. Something I'll assume about sex and fantasy, you seem to have read most of fantasy. I guess it's more 
restrictive than science fiction, you haven't got all the gadgets, science can get you to help you along. You can say

54:06.379 --> 54:12.184
what you think of Conan's sex life. I don't know. It always seems to be happening. He never seems to get in. He rides off 
into the sunset with a maiden under one arm and his horse between his legs, and that's the case.

54:28.500 --> 54:30.582
He never seems to really get anywhere. He seems to be in favour of hanging around with big strong men all the way around.

54:41.341 --> 55:03.214
You mean,

54:41.341 --> 55:03.214
you know, he meets the girl and he takes her up to the bedroom, then you get dot, dot, dot, and then it's the next day.

55:03.194 --> 55:12.566
interest

55:03.194 --> 55:12.566
in violence, in vampirism, and horror films in general. And it doesn't even matter, depending on whether the hero, lay 
as a heroine, because the whole story is filled with sexually satisfying experiences on that straight plane. I mean,

55:27.464 --> 55:32.070
fantasy is essentially unusual sex. And not just, not a huge explicit thing, it's a steal. I mean, if it gives you a shot, 
if they want to read a novel that's explicitly sexual, they can go over with any of the popular sex novels in the show. But

55:47.115 --> 55:58.227
the success, the mind, sort of in the sorcery novels in particular, seems to me, the very simplistic sexual nature I 
mean, we're looking at massive souls, you know. I've never had a six-foot-two guy come to shop for a soda and soda, you

56:03.842 --> 56:07.137
know.

56:11.032 --> 56:37.371
that they will get kicked out of the sword and sorcery levels and banned by horror films. The swords have felled 
similar to that. How many years have you been a vampire? This guy, you don't think he's a fan of a girl's neck or a friend?

56:51.367 --> 56:54.512
Because lesbian vampires are becoming much more explicit these days. And I fully expect that some of these sort of three 
novels will basically become more explicit. I don't think there's a set in the Elbrich novel that is explicit to take.

57:07.833 --> 57:36.709
What did you say? If it's a start, if it's a, if you can't make a crack in the, in the, in the, in the religion. It's close. 
They made us a tune. Don't...

57:46.105 --> 58:06.544
Why are

57:46.105 --> 58:06.544
horror films so popular

57:46.105 --> 58:06.544
with young girls? Well, then what was the very first world, that was Witchcraft, the immediate post-given range. The 
old girls, over 20, don't have any nearest-much-feeling to the witchcraft

58:18.185 --> 58:35.467
genealogy. They get more of the water-setting, factory-like astrology, and tarot, and stuff like that. I think it's 
very interesting that very young girls read and do it in between novels and vampire novels and horror to get the pants get

58:45.269 --> 59:00.628
onto the ones that hurt. Since we're running out of time I think we'll keep moving along and reach a good climax. Do you 
want to say something cool? Actually,

59:09.299 --> 59:38.462
if anyone's read an anthology, I think it's a thing within my eyes, I think there's a very good short story in there with 
the building humorous sex situations. All sorts of bizarre bisexual relationships occur in between the hero and the

59:41.555 --> 59:48.202
aliens. Unfortunately, I haven't got a book here so I can't read any of it out. That's sort of rather good, but then again, 
his novel, I think it's When Harley Was One, contains some very bad sex relations. Sort of almost as bad as probably worse

01:00:03.113 --> 01:00:09.862
than Silverberg, but since it's one of his first novels, I guess it's excusable to say. Yeah, and it's Paul says it's just 
sort of just pops in halfway through and that's what we hear about it, you know. We're hardly having this crisis, you

01:00:21.558 --> 01:00:23.721
know. All of his name is often paired with the one in the doctor, isn't it? The New Zealand Coop is not allowed by the sort of 
group in the shop without a computer. It makes for the female. I don't know what it's about, but the panel thinks it's a

01:00:35.518 --> 01:00:44.950
future for this type of fiction, you know, machine computer. Well, in this new Heinlein novel, the female computer 
marries Lazarus Long and becomes a clone, the consciousness of the computer, clones it with a body which is force fed and

01:00:45.487 --> 01:01:03.208
grown and marries the hero. So it's in line with the computer. And then there's a computer in one of the islands of Moon at 
the Harsh Mistress which has an ore gas and when it sees half the earth line up.

01:01:26.088 --> 01:01:37.482
What

01:01:26.088 --> 01:01:37.482
about Hal 900 in 2001?

01:01:38.604 --> 01:01:42.068
His voice is very ambiguous in that. What second Hal? I think he sounds that much ambiguous. I think

01:01:49.645 --> 01:02:19.298
both

01:01:49.645 --> 01:02:19.298
the astronauts

01:01:49.645 --> 01:02:19.298
there

01:01:49.645 --> 01:02:19.298
were

01:01:49.645 --> 01:02:19.298
pretty asexual Actually,

01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:29.145
the computer in Barbarello was much more interesting than the relationship with Barbarello. You mean Rashi outwrites 
the machine? Oh, that's the thing. It is an instance. Sort of a hazard for the sexual organ.

01:02:43.446 --> 01:02:46.551
That's an example of sex in the SF film they did in the Anyone like to hazard a guess as to what form sex will take in future 
esophageal. You think because more explicit sex scenes are allowable now, writers all tend to include explicit sex

01:02:53.090 --> 01:03:09.727
scenes in their books and shy away from the unusual sex. I guess that's the sort of one hazard in that they're going to use 
more explicit sex and not use so much imagination. I just sort of became more pornographic, and rather than more unusual

01:03:17.767 --> 01:03:37.115
sex scenes, he said that Phil Farmer's books, the ones he's written for, they're not so much better than what he'd 
written when he was just writing SF, like Time Stopping. Well, it's certainly more amazing and more erasing and Well,

01:03:43.113 --> 01:03:55.956
you know, I think they certainly, I'll certainly more imagine, when Farmer bought and stopped out at any of his 
pictures, like the Ripple World, I think we really left that interview as go. Well, I don't think anybody's approached

01:03:56.637 --> 01:04:00.143
him. What, do you mean a little snake in the womb, that sort of thing that lives in the womb of a young lady? No, there's a 
whole sexual terror that means to truly terrify it, because it has never been done in science fiction in that way. It's

01:04:22.935 --> 01:04:26.759
done for the relationship. It really turns into a wolf when the guy is taken up with the tantrum I thought there was a bit 
with the iron teeth on there, the guy was a bit prudent. That killed everybody, it was definitely the first chapter of the

01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:40.825
series. And the most terrifying line that's made up is CLT. So there's this little line where he was tripping in and his 
operative play, and all that sort of finished the job, but it's something like he warped with his sneaker.

01:05:00.856 --> 01:05:26.813
Do

01:05:00.856 --> 01:05:26.813
you see that as a possible area in which science fiction may develop more along that lines than as, you know, straight 
science fiction?

01:05:26.793 --> 01:05:33.607
The constitution has made any nature so as a measure of literature. At most point is this bringing into you a civil 
history sexual relationship to the most per se, old-fashioned nature which has nothing to make you come into the story.

01:05:47.991 --> 01:05:54.865
If you're going to rise to that stage, or have a transomal situation, we are having it everywhere in the book. But if you 
can't do it, imagine it, please. and differently. I don't know, I don't know. I think you just invent another tradition.

01:06:05.717 --> 01:06:19.617
But if the sexual relationship of the creatures are explored and they've opened your mind, I'd come and I'd go in the 
window and I'd go, you know, this is what I'm doing. But over there, and here I'm just going to get Christ if I'm going by

01:06:19.957 --> 01:06:23.462
some of it clearly and expect probably bring up his friend and have a computer and both of that.

01:06:35.643 --> 01:06:36.885
I think we can close then. And, well, if no one has anything else to say, yeah. Well, there is another aspect that we didn't 
touch on. That film has been in the sort of situation that you have there. We get population pressure from the police,

01:06:48.725 --> 01:06:56.137
which is sort of a moratorium on birth. I think it was 30 years. I'd prefer the T-8-6-1-1-3-8 film to that one. A situation 
like that would never exist because any government that tried to force it, if it was a democratic government, would be

01:07:00.922 --> 01:07:27.233
out on their

01:07:00.922 --> 01:07:27.233
neck.

01:07:30.352 --> 01:07:50.908
I

01:07:30.352 --> 01:07:50.908
think the

01:07:30.352 --> 01:07:50.908
government

01:07:30.352 --> 01:07:50.908
is tending towards being more non-democratic and that's politics. I think we better sort of close this panel now, too. 
Oh, gee, just when we get started. I'll remind people at 3.30 there's a talk by Dr Peter Dullin.

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:07.112
That's right, buddy. Just copy by

01:08:07.132 --> 01:08:12.358
it. Who's lecturer in psychology at Adelaide University and who's going to speak on the subject of science fiction in 
the occult. So I'll just leave it to him, then. Well, I've been a longtime reader of science fiction

01:08:24.436 --> 01:08:37.815
possibly for about 25 years now. I've been absorbing this particular brew. I've also been on the fringes of 
psychological research for around about the same period of time. And

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:53.177
I think that this This twin

01:08:53.495 --> 01:09:06.096
set of circumstances should have led me long before now to start to put the two together. It's only in fact being invited 
to speak to you today that led me to wonder whether there was any connection between the two interests. It may be thought

01:09:15.415 --> 01:09:37.139
to be insulting perhaps to suggest the sorts of interests that lead people or the sorts of people that are interested in 
science fiction are likely to be the sorts of people who are interested in the occult because we all know some very odd

01:09:15.415 --> 01:09:37.139
sorts of people who are interested in the occult. I see no evidence looking around me that very odd people are interested 
in science fiction And certainly some of the oddest of the people that I've known who have been interested in the occult

01:09:45.183 --> 01:10:00.621
have been, or profess themselves interested in science fiction, but usually of the RL fan thought variety. Not of the 
Arthur Clarke or even John Wyndham variety.

01:10:13.212 --> 01:10:39.372
That's one sort of connection, however, and I suppose that a generous way of putting it is that the sort of people who are 
interested in the occult and the sort of people who are interested in science fiction are both likely to also be

01:10:13.212 --> 01:10:39.372
oriented towards the idea of the universe being a rich and wonderful place in which many extraordinary things can 
happen. There are, of course, other ways in which science fiction and the occult are connected. For instance, there are

01:10:48.048 --> 01:11:01.105
a tremendous number of science fiction novels and stories which either have occult themes or refer to the occult. Now, I 
think that if you look at the way in which science fiction refers to the occult, some very interesting things emerge.

01:11:11.195 --> 01:11:26.372
There seem to be, obviously, because science fiction is such a mixed kind of genre,

01:11:11.195 --> 01:11:26.372
a number of different sorts of use of the occult in science fiction. In the straight fantasy situation, obviously, it's 
a dream mechanism or something of that kind. You can just throw it in to enable things to happen that couldn't otherwise

01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:39.987
happen. However, and given this, I don't think there's an enormous amount of point in saying a lot about it on the fantasy 
side, although it might be worthy of note that one theme that very frequently turns up in fantasy, which uses the occult

01:11:41.030 --> 01:12:04.827
as part of its material, that There seems very often to be accepted by the author, and presumably therefore by the 
reader, that there's some sort of opposition between regulation science and the accounts. That's in books like, for

01:12:17.621 --> 01:12:22.292
instance, The Incomplete Enchanter, which I think is one of the most delightful works, actually, in any area of science 
fiction. But that clearly was a sort of fantasy. But one of the striking points was that where magic works, science

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.625
didn't. That is, the person could do remarkable things by reciting formulae, but his matches wouldn't work. And I think 
that's very significant. We will return to that later. But to look at the more regulation science fiction, I suppose the

01:12:54.802 --> 01:13:10.369
more science extension sort of science fiction, there where the occult is referred to, very seldom is it left in the 
condition in which it is in our everyday world, in the attitudes of people in real life today. That is, there are very few

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:36.492
science fiction books which refer to ESP or any such theme or any occult theme, while at the same time giving much 
credence to the common view to their among intellectuals anyway of skepticism. The only one that springs to mind at once

01:13:44.944 --> 01:14:02.007
as a contradiction to what I've just said is Hoyle's black cloud where the rather absurd Russian scientist I think had 
some very hard words to say. about people believing in ghosts and this kind of thing. But then he said some very silly

01:14:06.572 --> 01:14:11.877
things anyway, and not a character to be taken seriously. Indeed, I don't believe that any of Hoyle's characters are 
characters to be taken seriously. But, leaving that aside, most people have either ignored the occult completely, or

01:14:16.683 --> 01:14:30.357
their world of the future, or their possible world, or whatever it is, has accepted psychic events as being fairly 
normal sorts of things that just happen

01:14:30.775 --> 01:14:45.072
even in something like John Wyndham's chrysalids where clearly telepathy was something which most people didn't 
expect to happen. It wasn't because it was unbelievable, but it was precise, so to speak. It was because it was

01:14:59.573 --> 01:15:00.694
different. There was no suggestion there was anything unlikely about it. Now, on the other side of the We have the real 
life situation that there are a tremendous number of people and highly intelligent, highly educated people who are

01:15:10.752 --> 01:15:24.778
very, very skeptical. about ESP. I suspect most of these cannot be science fiction readers or writers. If you'll leave a 
remarks I've just been making. So there is a perhaps an interesting observation. The sort of people that display the

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:50.901
most typical scientific skepticism about the occult today are not members of our confraternity. Now, this business of 
skepticism is, I think, the oddest phenomenon of all in the occult field. And I've, in fact, devoted some attention as a

01:16:01.973 --> 01:16:15.910
psychologist, it's been something I've been interested in, in the phenomena of skepticism. And one of the things which 
is very striking is the way in which skepticism alters your appreciation of evidence. Why is the atmosphere so

01:16:27.119 --> 01:16:29.362
different? Or what is it that's so different about the attitude to ESB in science fiction, even among people that don't, 
in writing science fiction books, make ESB a central theme or ESB audio cult for that matter?

01:16:47.378 --> 01:16:55.047
Well, when you look at, for instance, the chrysalids, what's so weird and wonderful about the phenomenon that's being 
talked about? All it appears to be is that certain individuals have got a built-in radio. There's nothing terribly

01:16:59.192 --> 01:17:02.697
astonishing about it. They have perhaps an unfair advantage over the rest of humanity in that they can communicate with 
each other over considerable distances without using apparatus and so on. But there's nothing particularly odd about

01:17:15.374 --> 01:17:17.918
it, it's just something that happens.

01:17:22.784 --> 01:17:32.758
Similarly, I suppose even in the incomplete enchanted with magic, again, the magic's a pretty casual kind of thing, 
pretty ordinary, it's just another kind of technology. It happens to be, as I've suggested in this particular case,

01:17:33.239 --> 01:17:43.373
postulated that it's inconsistent with the other sort of technology, the techno technology. But it's a very ordinary, 
very everyday. The

01:17:46.538 --> 01:18:04.915
attitude of skepticism, which the scientific man in the street appears to have towards the occult, in other words, 
generates some of the oddity of the phenomena itself. ESP is hard to prove, not because it's a weird, intractable

01:18:06.617 --> 01:18:13.663
phenomenon, but because people don't believe in it. And I think that one can illustrate this fairly well by imagining 
what would happen if one did live in one of these science fiction worlds, in which there are many, even among people, even

01:18:15.787 --> 01:18:35.729
the worlds created by writers who are not themselves writing about ESP, in which ESP, or magic for that matter, are facts 
of life. If somebody is supposed to be a psi person, and they claim to have got some information from somebody else's

01:18:39.952 --> 01:18:56.453
mind, the answer is, oh yes, well, you know, we must stop this happening, or we'll turn to you, we must make use of this 
ability, or something like this. Now, in the skeptics world, the result, the immediate question is, how can I know that

01:18:57.214 --> 01:19:08.608
you've got it from his mind? Now just imagine if you came up to somebody in the morning and you said, um, I hear that there

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:22.136
was a terrible air crash last night. I think it was in the Lebanon. And the chap says, how do you know? And you said, well, I 
heard it on the radio. Expect me to believe that. Prove it. And you try to prove, for instance, that you didn't see a

01:19:37.782 --> 01:19:49.321
newspaper lying across the back of a chair as you walked after you were sitting around this morning, or that you didn't 
get it by ESP.

01:19:52.566 --> 01:19:55.150
It would be a pretty intractable sort of task. The fact is the difficulties of the situation are created by the skeptics' 
attitudes. Now, I am becoming sort of paranoid about these skeptics because, and I may say, before I go any further, I am

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:13.941
not by any means convinced of all aspects of the evidence about ESP and so on. I just don't know. I'm very much a 
fence-sitter. But it seems to me that the skeptics are behaving very peculiarly. In fact,

01:20:23.092 --> 01:20:34.363
there are plenty of phenomena that are just as unrepeatable, just as difficult to control the ESP phenomena claimed to 
be. And I have the impression that in this field, and indeed in a number of other fields, the skeptic, and it's not only

01:20:35.784 --> 01:20:51.799
skepticism as we'll see in a minute, is in fact creating ghosts for itself to chase. that in fact he is making the thing 
seem a damn sight more mysterious than it need be. I say it's not only skepticism because I think that I see similar

01:21:03.716 --> 01:21:11.086
symptoms in certain other areas of activity. I was at a paper the other day given by Professor JC Smart, who used to be the 
head of the philosophy department, at Adelaide, and he was talking about modal logic. In fact, his paper was entitled

01:21:28.802 --> 01:21:34.967
Possible Worlds, which sounds like a good science fiction-y sort of title, and that's one of the reasons I went. The 
other reason I went is a very good friend of mine, but I expected him something fairly gutsy about ideas of possibility.

01:21:45.017 --> 01:21:48.820
What I actually got was a feverish attack on modal logic. And why was modal logic being attacked? Because in Jack Smart's 
analysis of it, it looked as if he was going to have to believe if he wanted to use modal logic in the simultaneous

01:21:52.823 --> 01:22:10.234
existence of an infinite number of possible worlds in which different things happened. So that when, in motor logic, 
the analysis of, for instance, the statement, if I, Ron Barassi, had imported a few West Australians I would have won,

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:34.895
involved, in fact, in phishing a possible world in which Ron Barassi actually did import lots of Australians and win. 
Well, lots of West Australians and win.

01:22:40.994 --> 01:22:48.483
My view is that in this particular instance, Jack Smart was in fact creating a ghost. There was no philosophical 
validity in his belief that it was necessary to actually believe in these possible worlds in order to use modal logic.

01:23:00.658 --> 01:23:08.908
Now, both Jack Smart and a number of other philosophers similarly in the area of the problem of mind. appear to be on a 
crusade against what in fact Jack calls ghost stuff that is the stuff of which mind is made up he's desperately anxious to

01:23:10.019 --> 01:23:29.496
avoid a philosophical position which involves him in believing in some mysterious mental substance In fact, I believe 
it's perfectly possible to get by without this mysterious mental substance. But it seems to me the interesting thing

01:23:35.818 --> 01:23:45.628
about his position on these different topics is that he is creating a situation of mystery in order not to believe in it. 
But in fact, philosophical arguments which say that there is a mystery, a weekend philosophical arguments for the

01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:56.178
position out of which he's generating the mystery. Now go back to the ESP. Who was it that made ESP so mysterious? Well, it 
is true that J.B. Ryan started the ball rolling himself by taking a sort of anti-materialist line. But let's face it,

01:24:13.192 --> 01:24:14.694
that's just J.B. Ryan. There's nothing in the phenomena which has this weird... ghostly

01:24:19.747 --> 01:24:24.553
implication. All that the phenomena say is that some dear robber is getting some information and we don't know how the 
heck they got it. There's nothing mysterious or ghostly about that. And when you look at the evidence that, for

01:24:36.187 --> 01:24:47.661
instance, ESP doesn't obey the laws of ordinary science, what you find is that that evidence is very weak. very much 
weaker than the evidence that ESP occurs, for instance. Now look at the skeptics argument. I've often found myself

01:24:55.084 --> 01:25:09.885
arguing with skeptics saying something like, um, well, ESP can't occur because there's evidence that suggests it 
doesn't obey the inverse swirl. and anything which involves radiation from points got to obey that. Well, then you look

01:25:14.863 --> 01:25:20.810
at the evidence that ESP doesn't have any, it did the inverse square law, and that evidence is rotten. In fact, the 
evidence that ESP doesn't have any inverse square law is about as strong as the evidence that radio doesn't have any

01:25:21.892 --> 01:25:30.102
inverse square law. So what's happening is rather like somebody saying, stands to reason there can't be any unicorns 
because there wouldn't be enough young virgins to go around.

01:25:41.437 --> 01:25:47.304
Well, this is again, I think, a beautiful example of people creating the ghosts that they're not going to believe in. The 
fact is that nobody quite knows where science ends and the occult takes over.

01:25:56.845 --> 01:26:19.225
There may be people around, and I suspect that Jack Smart, who I'm being very nasty to today for no particular reason, but 
there are people who really believe that most of the basic concepts of science are there, laid out, ready for our use,

01:25:56.845 --> 01:26:19.225
that there's nothing big and new to be discovered. Now, this seems to me to be, and that is that really, that there are no 
whole fields of new forces and new sets of laws in which we should enable things to relate together very differently from

01:26:19.492 --> 01:26:35.751
the way they appear to the net. And it seems to me this is a very unlikely state of affairs. And it's a very unlikely state of 
affairs for a number of reasons. One is, simply that when you look at all the basic concepts on which scientific thinking

01:26:46.880 --> 01:27:01.328
is based today, you find that you only have to think for about three minutes to generate a paradox. Whether you talk about 
time, whether you talk about cause, whether you talk about Even, I suppose, a relevance, which is a concept which lies

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:19.894
behind science very strongly, where most scientists don't notice it. All of these things generate paradoxes very 
easily. And Bertrand Russell, among many other philosophers, pointed out that whenever you come across a paradox,

01:27:23.781 --> 01:27:35.238
it's about time to be doing some philosophizing. Something is going wrong. There's something wrong with your basic 
concepts. Well, this being said, there's room for an immense amount of reshuffling of our basic concepts in science.

01:27:49.327 --> 01:27:56.919
Who knows what, when the reshuffling takes place, will appear to be obvious, which appears to be impossible now? Who 
knows what new forces there is room for, or new relationships? I certainly wouldn't be so bold as to make any guesses.

01:28:09.466 --> 01:28:12.591
Meanwhile, we have claims that there are phenomena.

01:28:15.395 --> 01:28:30.517
It's claimed that some people do obtain information from others, which information it seems very difficult to see as 
being transmitted by any of the means we know that we're transmitting information.

01:28:34.262 --> 01:28:38.308
On the face of it, not a very astounding sort of claim. It is true that when you try to prove these claims, you run up against 
difficulties. You run up against difficulties, though, only because the standards of evidence for which you're being

01:28:51.044 --> 01:29:04.245
required to

01:28:51.044 --> 01:29:04.245
reach are being determined by the skeptics. In fact, most of the experiments that someone like in ESP, for instance, 
that someone like Mark Hansel dismisses, would be in most branches of science regarded as pretty watertight

01:29:05.727 --> 01:29:19.607
experiments.

01:29:22.892 --> 01:29:31.144
After all, Mark Hansel, in order to discredit an ESP experiment, only has to show that there's some way in which somebody 
could have cheated. including an experiment or including if necessary all five experimenters. Now, what branch of

01:29:37.782 --> 01:29:42.713
science or regulation science could stand up to this? How many physics experiments do we know that have been carried out 
under conditions where this sort of cheating has been ruled out? doesn't very often happen. In fact, a lot of physics

01:29:55.730 --> 01:30:07.155
experiments, including some of the very simplest ones, not only could cheating have been carried out a lot of the time, 
but there's plenty of contrary evidence. You take experiments, very simple experiments, that used to be done

01:30:07.793 --> 01:30:22.011
regularly at school, in my school anyway, of showing that you can put ice in the bottom of a boiling tube and boil the water 
at the top without melting the ice. I remember having a very revealing experience one day of coming in after that lesson

01:30:28.617 --> 01:30:42.238
and finding neatly wrapped up in the piece of wire gauze in which we had thought that these visor field place, nine next to 
the boiling tube on the desk, was in fact a piece of glass. It's clear that our science teacher hadn't been that confident

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:53.815
and had put one over on us. In fact, he was worth aware that the odds were quite high that if he tried this experiment 
himself, it wouldn't work. And indeed, for every once that a scientist has repeated most of the simple scientific

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:12.179
experiments, thousands of schoolteachers and schoolchildren have repeated them and got the opposite results. But 
who takes that into account? I'll hardly say the evidence however was consistent. The fact is that the standards of

01:31:19.242 --> 01:31:32.070
evidence are determined by the level of preparedness to believe of the people who are the actual critics and judges of 
those experiments. So we have a situation where we have a phenomenon which on the face of it doesn't seem, in my view, a set

01:31:33.468 --> 01:32:03.255
of phenomena which on the face of it don't seem, in my view, all that intrinsically unlikely and a set of people who are 
controlling the levels of belief in the scientific community who are influencing on all levels the response to the data

01:32:05.378 --> 01:32:17.376
Now, the science fiction writers, of course, writing of future worlds are not looking at it from the point of view of the 
scientific skeptic. They're saying, let's envisage a future world in which we set our adventure, whatever it may be,

01:32:17.757 --> 01:32:27.572
and Well, one of the things that might have happened in this future world is that ESP has become accepted. And as soon as it 
becomes accepted, there it is, a perfectly ordinary part of life. It may have its problems, it may have a need for new

01:32:40.618 --> 01:32:48.430
legislation, indeed it almost certainly will. but it doesn't look very odd in that context at all. Now one concept which 
I think that scientists really ought to get hold of in fact, or one notion that they really ought to get hold of, which I

01:32:52.959 --> 01:33:13.354
think is a very important one, which all that I've been saying illustrates to be important, is this notion that the 
process of setting a priori probabilities on events is not a part of science as yet. We have innumerable techniques for

01:33:18.383 --> 01:33:29.993
assessing evidence in certain fixed contexts, for designing experiments for reasoning out with some traumatic 
exceptions. What are the consequences of theories? What should be the prediction from theories? What we do not have is

01:33:44.569 --> 01:33:48.974
any scientific techniques for setting a priori probabilities. These are set by nothing more or less than the 
atmosphere in the scientific community. And every now and then this leads to quite bizarre results. In 1915, Wagener

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:11.978
put forward his theory of continental drift, which was entirely consistent with the evidence that was available. 
reasonably by today's standards, and it would be sane-sounding theory that you had a layer of rock which was actually

01:34:12.970 --> 01:34:40.513
not quite as solid over long periods of time as it appeared to be over the short periods of time that we have direct contact 
with it, and that the consonants were floating on this soft layer and other bits of rock were floating and moving around.

01:34:40.696 --> 01:34:54.350
and it traced out the ways in which outlines of various bits of the map, as it is now, would have fitted together, or very 
reasonable. In fact, this theory was created by the scientific community. It was a complete score. For some reason,

01:35:00.216 --> 01:35:05.522
which I can't quite tie down, it seemed to be just basically unlikely. And for many years, vagueness theory was just a 
sign to the curiosity that there's a nut called vagueness who put forward this theory. And weirdly, the consonants

01:35:14.888 --> 01:35:22.921
almost look as if it might be right, though of course its nonsense was the attitude. Now, of course, we can measure in 
inches per year how much the consonants are drifting. But as I say, there's a very good example of completely capricious

01:35:30.562 --> 01:35:37.813
assignment of a priori probabilities. And it's the capricious assignment of a priori probabilities to phenomena like 
ESP that creates the experimental difficulty in showing that it occurs. And let's say the science fiction writer's use

01:35:51.605 --> 01:35:59.915
of the concept as an everyday one illustrates very well that this is the case. As soon as you think in terms of a world in 
which ESP is not regarded as extraordinary, then it jolly well isn't extraordinary. That's all there is to it. Clearly

01:36:13.691 --> 01:36:21.460
there are other areas in the ESP, and a cult doesn't just mean ESP. Phenomenon like ghosts, for instance, mixing with the 
occult, as indeed, I suppose, Phenomenon is like the Phenomenon like demons. And

01:36:31.848 --> 01:36:45.726
these, of course, also have been treated by science fiction writers, although by and large, Demons and straight magic 
tend to be dealt with in the fantasy category rather than in the straight science fiction category. I think there are

01:36:58.170 --> 01:37:08.085
probably one or two of Sheckley's things that might be regarded as science fiction as opposed to fantasy which dealt 
with the year after and so on. I think that's probably science fiction, just from fantasy. say by and large these are

01:37:19.726 --> 01:37:43.219
fantasy and one of the reasons they tend to be fantasy I think is because as soon as you start dealing with magic per se you 
start getting this thing about the about its opposition to science coming in as soon as you start saying or as soon as

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:52.500
science fiction writers start saying, for instance, you can get this done by muttering this formula. or by making up a 
little poem or something then you're dealing in a world which is, I suppose, sufficiently different from the everyday

01:37:52.784 --> 01:38:20.783
one we're used to that you feel like postulating some other great differences and you're very conscious of the fact that 
you're dealing with the abnormal and then I think the

01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:41.147
This being so, you're now able to get a kind of anti-science bias, if you like, in your thinking and to exaggerate all of 
the things which go with magic, including its distinction from science. And the other thing I suppose is that, you know,

01:38:42.689 --> 01:38:50.280
I myself, for instance, will assign very low priorities. to control

01:38:50.497 --> 01:38:57.567
the world by much informally. Certainly one can do much informally, but things like making water boil and this kind of 
thing, I would, on the whole, think it's rather unlikely, although I stand open to be convinced. And this being so, The

01:39:16.197 --> 01:39:28.256
person who puts these things into his story must be aware that he's standing up against the whole background of today's 
technological thinking. And he might just as well go the whole hog and say technology doesn't work here.

01:39:38.132 --> 01:39:41.057
We work on this other pattern instead.

01:39:43.096 --> 01:39:46.740
So, that's what happens with that. Now, with the afterlife concept, I think something else happens. I think we tend to 
become here when we operate the science fiction producers.

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:11.010
Be dazzled with the notion of a separate occult, the notion of ghost stuff, As it's very difficult to talk about actual 
ghosts without thinking in terms of ghost stuff, it's easy for me to say a PSP, that doesn't involve ghost stuff. Of the

01:40:21.882 --> 01:40:24.285
mind, that doesn't involve ghost stuff. But when it talks about, when I come to talk about ghosts, there seems to be 
something a bit strange about saying that doesn't involve ghost stuff. But on the other hand, I don't think this is

01:40:32.837 --> 01:40:36.722
necessarily so. It seems to me that, again, there's nothing In principle, inconsistent

01:40:40.505 --> 01:41:03.762
with any science that we have of the idea that a being, by existing as a living being in this world, has effects on some 
physical aspect of his environment, which effects persist, which effects continue to act. The whole system is so darn

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:25.716
complex that I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that something akin to personality can still exist in these effects, 
in the complex of effects that we have on our environment. I'm not putting this forward as a theory. I'm merely saying

01:41:29.522 --> 01:41:41.427
that theories along these sorts of lines don't seem to me to be ruled out of court by the current position of science. 
Furthermore, suppose they were, suppose the idea of the afterlife, or any of the phenomena associated with ghosts and

01:41:42.554 --> 01:42:00.782
so on, were to involve principles that science has not yet thought of. Under what circumstances would these become 
occult principles? I've already suggested there's room in science for a whole lot of new principles. There's room for

01:42:14.523 --> 01:42:20.691
whole new sets of forces, whole new sets of relationships. Now, if we're forced to agree that afterlives involve these 
new sets of principles, new sets of forces that we haven't yet envisaged,

01:42:36.503 --> 01:42:37.444
So be it. But does it follow that these things will be unincorporable in science? Nothing about what I've said so far in 
any way suggests this. Now this, I think, brings me back to Jack Smart and his ghost hunting. Here he is saying, I must

01:42:57.935 --> 01:43:06.949
avoid any theory of the mind and the body which involves the mind as ghost stuff. But when does the ghost stuff become 
ghost stuff? What does it have to do? Well, what it has to do is to refuse to be incorporated in the general body of

01:43:15.002 --> 01:43:21.732
knowledge in a consistent kind of way. But there's nothing about simply being a kind of stuff we haven't yet identified 
that tells one that it has this peculiar property. Now, either Jack is saying, there is no more to be found out. There are

01:43:38.158 --> 01:43:47.972
no grand new principles, even if, you know, somebody okay may find some small sort of regulation we haven't thought of, 
but nothing big, nothing that really matters. Either he's saying this, and since it's obvious that mind is going to be

01:43:48.442 --> 01:44:09.775
outside any of the forces that we have and materials that we know of now, that automatically makes mind ghost stuff, or I 
would have thought he would have to say, Well okay, if you find your new forces, if you find your new sorts of scientific

01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:27.949
interaction, then mind stuff gets incorporated in science, and it's not good stuff anymore. And as I say, what applies 
to mine, stuff I see no reason shouldn't apply to ghost stuff. I've no particular reason to think it does. I don't think

01:44:37.159 --> 01:44:42.985
the evidence for ghosts is frightfully hard as things are going. I do think the evidence that sometimes when people sit 
down to guess cards something funny happens is quite strong. If we're to believe some of the reports emanating from

01:44:54.078 --> 01:44:57.902
Russia, it's more than just speculation. There's some big things happening. Unfortunately, these reports don't 
usually come with clear information as to how to obtain similar phenomena ourselves. And I think when you get lots of

01:45:12.617 --> 01:45:28.176
indirect reports of phenomena like this, and no hard data on how to repeat the experiments and this kind of thing, then 
you're quite right to be suspicious. And I myself am slightly suspicious. For instance, I actually can remember in

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:38.208
animal science

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:38.208
fiction, etc. A few days ago I came across a copy which had an article on about some of the Russian stuff. And talking about 
this woman who apparently can actually move objects by cytokinesis. And as if it was just perfectly ordinary thing that

01:45:53.519 --> 01:46:03.079
she was being studied in a laboratory with physiological apparatus and so on. And sure, you know, if this is happening 
then Forget about all the probability stuff, all the card guessing and attempts to get six to come up more often than

01:46:07.154 --> 01:46:19.286
chance when rolling dice, you know, here we've got real solid phenomenon. But unfortunately, the world keeps coming 
across these reports as I say, nobody gives clear details on exactly how we go about trying to find the same thing here.

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:37.043
And until we do, I think I'm going to remain suspicious I would be suspicious, I suppose, if a colleague in my own area of 
psychology kept writing me letters about how he was getting marvelous results on his new theory would never actually

01:46:37.647 --> 01:46:52.665
describe his experience.

01:46:55.849 --> 01:46:58.592
I wonder why he didn't. and he never published any papers in which the expense was clearly written up. So that's a ground 
for being suspicious. But leaving aside those perhaps overhoed for reports, nevertheless it seems to me there are

01:47:09.238 --> 01:47:27.465
sufficient funny things happening in the ESP research area to make one feel that it all can't be explained

01:47:09.238 --> 01:47:27.465
by fakery, bad statistics, and this sort of thing.

01:47:38.088 --> 01:47:46.600
Whether what is happening actually is some sort of communication, I'm somewhat hesitant about. It seems to me that the 
vast majority of ESP experiments are set out in such a way that anything statistically abnormal that happens is going to

01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:56.254
look like communication. and it might just be the statistical things are happening which don't look like 
communication which we're not dissecting out I mean if you set somebody to guess cards and somebody else to try to

01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:26.275
transmit them then you tend to look for various kinds of relationships between the guesses and the targets sure it looks 
like one person's sending a message to the other person but what if you found for instance that when a person tried to

01:48:26.693 --> 01:48:45.123
guess a pack of cards, there was statistically unlikely relationship between the sequence of guesses they produced 
and the sequence of targets you would produce by taking the actual target sequence, reversing it and moving forward.

01:48:46.686 --> 01:48:52.195
That wouldn't look so much like communication, and then you'd simply say something statistically unsightly. We're 
just selecting out the communication lines statistically on things to look at. Now, the other thing I think is, of

01:48:58.474 --> 01:49:10.470
course, that there's a lot of... When we come across, for instance, ESP, or individuals with PSI in books by E.C. Tarden, 
the sort of person, ESP, again, looks very different from what it looks like in the everyday reports we get of it. The

01:49:22.735 --> 01:49:27.363
E.C. Tarp and, for that matter, John Wyndham Psy phenomena are very much like using an internal telephone.

01:49:40.646 --> 01:49:47.258
The Telsi-Amberton Psy phenomena are Like our new kind of mental engineering, I suppose, you fiddle around with things 
by carrying out some sort of mental manipulation, which you can only imagine if you happen to be Tel-Siamese or someone

01:49:47.626 --> 01:50:04.690
like that, which theoretically anybody can. or most people could, to some degree. But it's a kind of engineering and 
curiously uninvolved kind of operation. Now, the real-life ESP phenomena accounts fall into two categories which are

01:50:14.729 --> 01:50:23.140
both very unlike this. They're either the card-guessing ones, in which a current situation in which the person who's 
doing it usually doesn't seem to know when he's doing it, That is, he can't tell his good guesses from his bad guesses, and

01:50:33.948 --> 01:50:51.252
where there seems to be no special feel attached to the experience at all, except perhaps a feeling of pride if he hasn't 
got so many right on something of this kind. The other kind of everyday report is of a spontaneous flash phenomenon which

01:50:51.272 --> 01:51:02.368
usually is highly emotionally charged which doesn't seem to be turn-onable at will, and which, when I say it's 
emotionally charged, it feels special in that the person says, you know, I had a dream last night which was so

01:51:02.517 --> 01:51:22.679
extraordinary, I really must tell you about it, I'm sure it means something. I had the funniest feeling this morning, 
they say. or something of this kind, but also, of course, the topics emotionally charged normally, in that, you know,

01:51:28.201 --> 01:51:41.398
it's usually about thread-falling under a bus or something equally exciting. So with opportune kind, the ESP card 
guessing experiment type, the spontaneous emotional communication type, and these are both different from the sort

01:51:42.219 --> 01:51:55.997
you get in ESP stories. which is the casual communication or casual mental engineering type. And I think that science 
fiction is developing a set of conventions, in other words, about psychic phenomena, which are quite different from

01:52:03.629 --> 01:52:16.450
what probably the psychic phenomena, if they exist, are like. This has happened in other fields too. It happens all the 
time. If you watch television, you'll find there's a whole set of conventions about what mental illnesses are like,

01:52:21.961 --> 01:52:35.012
which are all things that go with films. as a whole set of conventions, of course, in detective stories, but walk as to 
what murderers are like, and what detectives are like, for that matter, which have little relationship to real life. We

01:52:44.969 --> 01:52:47.512
know what the rules are within the particular field. Now, I think in the ESP field, science fiction writers are in danger 
of creating a set of conventions as to what the accounts like, or particularly what Psy is like, which bear little

01:52:47.993 --> 01:53:04.932
relation to real life Psy, assuming there is such a beast. and perhaps it's early enough in ESP for a corrective to be in 
science fiction, for a corrective to be administered, though I rather doubt this. Nobody as yet, I think, has really

01:53:18.924 --> 01:53:28.641
taken off in their science fiction writing from what we know about. ESP for instance, and incorporated that in a 
realistic style story in the future situation.

01:53:43.118 --> 01:53:54.291
But anyway, to sum up, there are a number of ways in which the occult and science fiction intersect

01:53:56.870 --> 01:54:10.589
They intersect through the common interest of the science fiction reader and writer and the occultist in the universe 
being a rather less boring place than it is for the ordinary person. They intersect in that the science fiction writer

01:54:12.471 --> 01:54:26.691
illustrates for us the effect of in real life our attitudes to the occult on the evidential situation on what we need if we 
are to believe in these phenomena and they intersect in that I suppose they

01:54:50.296 --> 01:55:17.113
show something about the way in which our ideas about particular phenomena can

01:54:50.296 --> 01:55:17.113
be conventionalised within a particular medium in such a way that they cease to bear any relationship with the real 
phenomena as they do in real life. Well, I think that's all I have to say. I'd be very happy if anyone would use to raise any

01:55:21.701 --> 01:55:35.922
questions or give us any illustrations.

01:55:35.942 --> 01:55:47.438
Yes?

01:55:48.565 --> 01:55:58.710
Well,

01:55:48.565 --> 01:55:58.710
I'm very bad at titles and authors. I think it would be like to know that you've read anything that I haven't read, it's 
fairly small. Can I run down the checklist? Yes, indeed, yes, indeed. Going back to you, yes, thanks for being

01:56:07.753 --> 01:56:16.688
a pilot, for example. The story is where he wrote about the people volunteering this corporation. It's a relishing 
their spirit into a sort of a parallel world, and they're still contactable by the right of the contact people living in

01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:36.935
this one. With the new materials. You've read that. There's a type of product that is sort of an old story. Then, of 
course, there's the thing there that the The genius of the clean individual, people like that. Pre-cognition.

01:57:16.875 --> 01:57:17.395
Pre-cognition, yes. There's priesthood, there are executions inside, producing a god that eventually becomes the spy

01:57:22.930 --> 01:57:42.136
of the day, and has effect on them rather than them having effect on human. And an old number of people who are just good 
across the class of years of time, in a believable sense, is called, is called, is called by Smith. Yes, yes. I'm not sure,

01:57:53.356 --> 01:58:05.188
I don't believe it.

01:58:05.168 --> 01:58:09.032
the school was a luck changer, in which she was black. She changed everything around her business to be a luck. And 
somehow or other, the biology of her shift connected her up to a physical amplify, an amplify of physical science, and

01:58:13.057 --> 01:58:25.891
broad cast this luck change to the entire planet. What's happening? We're so bad. Can't control ourselves please. Now 
who's the captain who has the the dog brain and whatnot, always has a silent communication officer. A janitor, yes.

01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:47.307
Then, of course, that's the opposite way around. Then, of course, there's the strike wishful filth, the Celtian 
stories, which have no relation to anything real whatsoever. There's no possible connection to anything real. Well,

01:59:01.985 --> 01:59:03.947
now, are you sort of Are you trying to

01:59:04.518 --> 01:59:11.466
question what I'm saying? I'm trying to say that science fiction basically is telling stories that people want to read 
and that I agree with you completely that reality is is very boring, most of the time. And again, we're creating, again we

01:59:33.273 --> 01:59:44.410
have to say, even if it's physical science, it doesn't have to be necessarily good science. All it has to be is believable 
science called time being. It's the same with science, the same with all the varieties of physical science. There's no

01:59:57.006 --> 01:59:57.887
difference to science. You don't have to be real. All you have to do is have to tell a good story. And there is a difference 
between science fiction which is based on real. There's a difference between science fiction which is based on

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:17.353
provable, demonstrable science. and science which cannot possibly be true, and science which might be true, if only it 
could drain up a wide distance. Yes, well, I would have thought that a bigger distinction within something than the ones

02:00:29.888 --> 02:00:42.745
that you just made when you were sort of misting the, you know, might be true, could be true, etc. is that I would have 
thought that there was a great gap between the science fiction which said, what if we discovered that and went on from

02:00:43.226 --> 02:00:56.503
there? to the science fiction, which actually starts off by, let's say, denying some of the things that we believe to be 
true, and says, and what is instead of science fiction? In fact, in a property of space, to be exact, there's something

02:01:13.570 --> 02:01:23.301
quite basic, is not there, or is twisted in some way, to go on from there. But I think there's still a tendency for 
conventions to arise even in here. I mean, science fiction, and somebody rather did produce a sort of dictionary of

02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:50.875
science fictionese recently, didn't they, in which they had terms like hyperspace, which are, you know, purely 
science fiction notions, but which ones which are

02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:50.875
used throughout science fiction by different writers in different contexts. And it is extraordinary how the science 
fiction convention, how wide the science fiction convention has developed. I mean the concept of an alien is in itself.

02:02:03.832 --> 02:02:07.176
a rather interesting science fiction concept. Yeah,

02:02:07.957 --> 02:02:16.867
but I think it is unfortunate in a way. I want to say unfortunate obviously, you know, if you say you're writing stuff to 
entertain people and the criteria are people entertained by it, then who wants to tie it down with rules? On the other

02:02:30.082 --> 02:02:33.045
hand, I think that it's worth I mean, there are a lot of people who, when they read science fiction, like to pick something 
of the, uh, what would happen if variety, uh, rather than what if instead of what we have so and so, where we're denying the

02:02:57.072 --> 02:03:03.199
world as it is and saying what if it isn't different and if it was different than this. And I think that it's a good idea if in 
these what if ones people are aware when they're when their conventions are departing from the comparison with the

02:03:19.398 --> 02:03:25.128
topic which started them off, so to speak. I honestly think that, by and large, if one could get on to the television 
writers who write things about mental illness, for instance, and get across to them that what they were presenting

02:03:25.829 --> 02:03:45.642
mental illness as was their own convention and nothing to do with mental illness.

02:03:53.181 --> 02:03:56.346
You know, I think on the whole they'd rather put it right before they went any further. And the fact is, they can get away 
without doing so because they've got a watching public that'll watch anything. But on the whole, it'd be nice if their

02:04:05.381 --> 02:04:10.609
convention matched the facts to some degree. Thank you very much. On the convention, if you'd like to go to talk

02:04:20.097 --> 02:04:33.276
What I'm going to say now is that there's actually

02:04:20.097 --> 02:04:33.276
more than what you might have thought of that way. I think there's a connection with that today. It's been very, sort of, 
about time to get the current score ahead of the three backwards. We make it real. Oh, I'm not suggesting... Look, I don't

02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:49.400
know how I've got myself into this, actually. I don't want to make prescriptions for science fiction writers. I don't 
even mind if they ignore the conventions. I'd just like them to know... I would just wish that they knew when they were

02:04:59.397 --> 02:05:05.607
doing so, and which ones. And I think that... it would be possible, for instance, to write science fiction stories which 
did use our A-science story, if one was interested in doing that sort of thing, which did in fact use a theory of science of

02:05:16.730 --> 02:05:28.487
ESP, which was entirely consistent with the data we have now, for instance. I think your basic trouble is you can't 
really expect all the people who are writing stories to think up really good theories that stand out under the people of

02:05:28.507 --> 02:05:39.623
the National Assortment. Every time, a lot of people get around this by saying, by setting up their own private 
universes. They don't have to restate all the postulates every time. And in fact, Chandler is what his doggy has been

02:05:51.909 --> 02:05:56.641
going around to do all the stuff. He's not made the concepts now, but he doesn't have to restate that by this time. But the 
fact that he, maybe this isn't the greatest idea ever, because he spent a lot of time trying to draw parallels between the

02:06:00.892 --> 02:06:21.330
evolution of the ferry ship world and years ago, the motor ship and many of the aircraft worlds now. into a future, 
depending on the status quo. People who worked out of sort of the system were evolving, and they just usually found

02:06:28.387 --> 02:06:36.379
themselves hung up against the brick wall. There's one that I might bring up here, that Mary Middleton has written a 
whole series of books, not necessarily about the same people, but about the same evolving history. and he bred himself

02:06:47.416 --> 02:06:57.310
into a corner because in one of the laser ones he postulated somebody who was bred for luck over a decade generation. The 
book's called Wingroom and it's like something quite different. One of the minor things is this lucky girl. Well the

02:07:04.361 --> 02:07:12.192
point was if you can't go on very many more generations before you get lost, very lucky people will learn because you feel 
the rest of us are not in that trouble. There was no way out if he stopped writing in that particular unit. About four or

02:07:17.342 --> 02:07:28.290
five years ago it was a pretty good area after which he had several, that's like the closest thing to ESP was. I think what 
has annoyed me and at the same time interested me very much in sound fiction in this particular area has been in a way

02:07:28.270 --> 02:07:46.419
what's now analog sound fiction during the run of John Campbell. He was well known to have a pretty legend of stories that 
pushed this particular era. The theory was, I don't know if it's really true, but the theory going around the line is that

02:07:52.469 --> 02:08:03.806
if you wanted to sell a story to the council, you had to bring any of it to do something. And in a way, this is bad, because 
it's limited to some of the people who had other quite bad stories and they've never gone around submitting the story.

02:08:12.719 --> 02:08:19.489
But he did maybe bring up a few new ideas, maybe got a few people outside the field. I wish there was more clear information 
on Russian stuff actually.

02:08:37.514 --> 02:08:42.220
Someone there wants to ask. The only

02:08:42.875 --> 02:08:57.829
thing I come across is a book on witchcraft. by a gentleman who believes has a distinction of holding would first be a 
witchcraft from one of the American universities. But that again only refers very peripherally to it. It doesn't give

02:09:12.972 --> 02:09:16.780
one the sort of details one would want to have one's skepticism sort of knocked down a little further. And it states very 
boldly, you know, that the Americans have got great psi research programs going on on a military basis as well, and you

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:35.484
know, it's a matter of some concern whether they can close the ESP gap and all that kind of nonsense. But no more than that 
really. What you're trying to say is that you don't object to people about writing about a completely fictitious

02:09:38.478 --> 02:09:52.217
universe or some impossible twist or something completely reversed and mysterious. What you're saying is they should 
know what they do and they should know all the time and make it obvious in the stories that they know how this conflicts

02:09:58.789 --> 02:10:16.078
with the available realities that have been tested at the moment. Well, I suppose in a way I'm saying that, although I 
wouldn't want to say it quite that strongly. I mean, I don't want to be reminded of three paragraph intervals. The guy

02:10:25.259 --> 02:10:26.462
knows this. You were saying that so much writing was floppy. Well, partly this, yes. But the other things, I'd like to see 
at least one story which does treat with, you know, with what we do know. And does handle the thing within the evidence.

02:10:43.130 --> 02:10:51.786
For instance, Ninian Marshall, some time ago, his philosopher, got himself into an argument with somebody who said ESP 
was just unclear, you couldn't make a proper scientific law relating to ESP. So, came up with this one. Well, take the law

02:11:04.878 --> 02:11:07.963
of gravity. Why can't we have it consistent with the data we've already got, an ESP law, which matches the law of gravity? 
It might go something like this. And this wasn't being put forward as the law of relating to ESP, but simply as an example

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:28.540
of one that might do.

02:11:30.562 --> 02:11:37.808
First of all, we'll say, patterns in the universe tend to become more similar to one another. Now, this is just like 
objects being attracted to one another. Patterns tend to become more similar. And they tend to do so in proportion as A,

02:11:47.637 --> 02:11:52.921
they are complex.

02:11:57.585 --> 02:12:00.568
B, they are already similar. which, of course, corresponds to objects being attracted when they're already closer to 
one another. It's more of acceleration and stability. Yeah, right. And C, there is some quantum type indeterminacy in

02:12:12.855 --> 02:12:17.961
their makeup.

02:12:20.925 --> 02:12:27.973
Now, the next thing to note, that is presumably, when people have thoughts, these are very complex patterns. And there 
must be some similarity in happening for two people having similar thought. And the human brain is a very, very complex

02:12:36.814 --> 02:12:42.640
organization. And there is indeed quantum type indeterminacy or something very close to it in the firing of neurons. 
That is above a certain level of stimulation. You can't say the neuron will fire, but you can specify probability of its

02:12:54.932 --> 02:12:59.277
firing. Now, in other words, patterns in human brains will be the things in the universe that we know of that will be most 
likely to obey this law. The law doesn't say anything at all about distance between the patterns. Anyway, this is Ninian

02:13:20.055 --> 02:13:24.220
Marshall's law. Now, it would be quite possible to have a science fiction story based on a law like this. The ESP will be 
entirely consistent with what we know so far of ESP. It might have to go further, but what Ninian Marshall's law does is

02:13:38.729 --> 02:13:47.878
to, in fact, take ESP as the communication category. That is, it might happen, for instance, that we're having ESP all 
the time, except that my pattern of elephant is very much like your pattern for fish. So whenever I'm thinking something

02:13:59.702 --> 02:14:09.938
like fish, and you're thinking something like elephant, we have a great tendency to do so, both of us. Now sure, you can 
set this up in a communication paradigm once you discover that my fish was like your elephant. or vice versa, but it

02:14:17.793 --> 02:14:23.961
certainly wouldn't look at all like a mental radio. It might well be that we could learn to send messages if we had, for 
instance, half a dozen people who were dispersed around the world of whom we'd ascertain that their patterns for

02:14:25.242 --> 02:14:46.990
particular symbols were fairly similar, and we could train them to detect the change in their own pattern when somebody 
else thought one of the other people produced there and so you can get a kind of course code in terms of recognize change

02:14:47.273 --> 02:15:16.268
what when I think the does anything happen to that to that thing and if it does then I've got one point of the message and say 
this is consistent with what we know it's different certainly unconventional. And it clearly could be a quite good kind

02:15:19.618 --> 02:15:24.664
of science fiction story. Now, I'm not saying someone's got to write that story. All I'm saying is that would in some ways 
be a rather better kind of ESP sort of story than some of the ones we get. Or it's a pity that someone is not doing that sort of

02:15:34.696 --> 02:15:39.842
thing, I think. I just think we're going to have to sort of cut this short now anyway. I thought there were no more 
questions. I'd like to thank you guys.

02:16:12.037 --> 02:16:17.503
Popular,

02:16:12.037 --> 02:16:17.503
if you like it. It's not popular most of it. Anyway, the lyrics to all this can be found in the latter half of your handbook 
on five pages in the latter part of the handbook. It's mainly if you want to sing along. Most of it's lyrical content on the

02:16:31.457 --> 02:17:10.191
science fiction. The first track's by Genesis called Watcher of the Skies and it was apparently inspired by the latter part of childhood's 
end for Arthur C. Clarke.

02:16:40.812 --> 02:23:38.485
[Music.]

02:24:42.134 --> 02:24:52.600
The next track is Wooden Ships by Crossby Stills and Nash and this is about a classic science fiction situation about the 
aftermath of an atomic war.

02:25:27.832 --> 02:30:27.481
[Music.]

02:30:27.481 --> 02:30:45.566
The next track by Pink Floyd is no lyrics of real consequences. It's only the music and the science 
fiction content, setting control for the heart of the sun.

02:31:04.285 --> 02:39:34.740
[Music.]

02:40:31.488 --> 02:40:44.649
So the next track is by King Crimson, 21st century skit-sword man. It's exactly nine as you turn it here by the music.

02:42:52.647 --> 02:47:36.360
[Music.]

02:48:32.948 --> 02:48:38.456
The next track is about as good an example of science fiction as you likely to find in music by a vandagraph generator. 
It's called... what is

02:48:38.476 --> 02:48:46.148
it called? It's called The Pioneers Overseas, it's about what happens when a group of people travels faster than the 
speed of light. It's about the very strange things that happen.

02:50:03.027 --> 03:01:18.365
[Music.]

03:01:18.365 --> 03:01:45.402
The next track is by Genesis, it's called Get 'Em Out by Friday and it was based on a, believe it or not, a real estate 
ad. And an interesting extrapolation of what might happen in the future with regard to this sort of thing. It's

03:02:03.996 --> 03:02:08.183
quite amusing.

03:02:58.754 --> 03:11:00.822
[Music.]

03:11:00.822 --> 03:11:05.128
For anyone who wants to hear eight minutes more, that's all clear. Two tracks by the Merling Road.

03:11:22.490 --> 03:18:24.604
[Music.]

03:19:08.442 --> 03:19:17.095
Around about 7 o'clock we'll start with a little commencement of the evening program which is taught by Mr Andrew Bear 
who's on the staff at Flinders University. He's just recently returned from England. He's going to talk on film

03:19:19.519 --> 03:19:24.647
censorship both in England and Australia. And some of you that read National Review, he had an interesting letter in 
last week's National Review. I'll leave it to him.

03:19:40.167 --> 03:19:45.153
Thanks, but anybody who stands up in public to talk about censorship should undertake two things. First is to try and say 
something new and fresh about a rather dreary, entire topic. The second is be prepared to stand up and be counted and say

03:19:51.942 --> 03:20:00.073
what he thinks censorship policy should be. I hope the body of the paper I give tonight will, to some extent, fulfill the 
first obligation. And the second, I'll fulfill now.

03:20:13.141 --> 03:20:17.866
First, I think censorship is important. This is my credo, if you like. Second, I'm in favour of the status quo. I think 
that Australia at the present time has a censorship system that works, which is administered by people who've been

03:20:24.274 --> 03:20:38.490
working properly, so that the balance just at the present time seems to me to be about right. Third, I think that Sue 
argues that a complete abolition of censorship in Australia at the present time is politically and socially

03:20:39.905 --> 03:20:50.280
unrealistic. Fourth, I don't think I'd advocate complete abolition anyway for three reasons. First is that I think 
that there should be some maintenance at least of the laws of libel, though not necessary in the present form. I think

03:21:06.787 --> 03:21:17.399
this because I think that any individual in a society has a right to be protected against what others might say about him 
or her. Second, I think that there ought to be properly a prohibition on manifestly socially dangerous propaganda in a

03:21:17.419 --> 03:21:34.718
society, and the two forms that I would think of particularly here, propaganda on the subjects of racism and 
anti-Semitism. by which I don't mean to say that the existence of racist and anti-Semitic attitudes in a society cannot

03:21:35.187 --> 03:21:48.068
be discussed or dramatized in the utter entertainment that a society has. I think finally that there should be some 
restrictions on the circulation of highly evocative material. That is, I think that it wouldn't suggest that such

03:21:56.956 --> 03:22:02.505
prohibitions are such restrictions. I'm

03:22:02.945 --> 03:22:13.822
just nearly in college. I know of no good reason at all why erotic material should be subject to control. But so long as 
adults in a society have access to material of quality in this field, I'm prepared rather reluctantly to concede that

03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:44.570
other people, if they want to, can restrict the circulation of commercial hardcore pornography in general and can 
restrict the access of young people to all forms of erotic material. That's a deal I'm prepared to make with other people

03:22:44.770 --> 03:22:49.255
in the society. Sixth implicit in that is the view I hold, which is that the so-called artistic merit criterion in 
censorship should be maintained and used. Can I say that? Acknowledging all the faults and difficulties and

03:23:01.240 --> 03:23:08.769
illogicalities that the use of the artistic merit criterion imposes. Now, it's obvious from that that my position on 
censorship is an entirely pragmatic one. It's based on my understanding of the social and political realities of

03:23:17.568 --> 03:23:21.214
present day Australian society. And that my reasons for accepting a pragmatic position instead of making a stand on 
principle, I hope will be some of the things that emerge from what I have to say. OK, well, that's me. That's what I

03:23:36.256 --> 03:23:37.138
believe. That's the position from which I speak. Now, the debate about censorship is different from censorship 
itself, an important element of it in Australia. has changed radically in the last three years. And the change in the

03:23:50.124 --> 03:23:57.312
debate about censorship follows directly on a radical change in the practice censorship in this country. Practice 
that was changed during the ministry, the customs ministry of Donald Chipp. Now prior to 1970, the people who publicly

03:24:04.780 --> 03:24:14.811
manifested a concern over censorship, that is the people who conducted the debate, were civil libertarians, artists, 
and those who wanted access to books and films which they weren't at that time allowed to see. They were fighting for the

03:24:21.144 --> 03:24:31.136
liberalization of an almost unbelievably restrictive censorship policy which had made Australia a joke in the 
Western world. The field of publishing, book publishing for example, was widely known that the phrase Australian

03:24:31.996 --> 03:24:44.410
edition of a book was synonymous with the phrase expugated edition. God knows Those people who conducted that debate 
and that fight had something to fight above. And it seems to me that the story of the eventual success is something that I

03:24:49.679 --> 03:24:57.129
regard as mildly inspirational. However, there were no particular heroes. And it's not my concern tonight to 
speculate about possible influences, who in this debate influenced who. But I think that four things in this latent

03:25:05.461 --> 03:25:14.633
movement up to the 1970s stand out as important influences or determining factors. What I've mentioned first is the 
constant example of the censorship practice in England and particularly of the work of Mr John Trevelyan who until 1971

03:25:15.085 --> 03:25:30.321
and for many years was secretary the British Board of Film Censors. I might add since I'll be referring to him several 
times tonight that John Trevelyan is by way of being a hero of mine. Indeed I wish it were he who was coming on a lecture tour

03:25:36.687 --> 03:25:42.173
of Australia later this year. rather than Mrs. Mary Whitehouse, who is being brought out here sometime in the near 
future. And I would, in fact, seriously recommend to those who are concerned about censorship that they invite Mr.

03:25:49.653 --> 03:26:02.048
Traversion to come to offer, as it were, the other side of the question, to the one that Mrs. Whitehouse is going to put. 
There are good grounds for that too, since the people who are inviting her are people who claim publicly that they

03:26:02.068 --> 03:26:12.160
believe in balance, and in always seeing the two sides of a case. should be presented. It seemed to me that he would be an 
admirable person to do that. So that there's the example of censorship in England, which I think had its influence in

03:26:18.478 --> 03:26:24.543
what happened in Australia after 1970. Secondly, there was a publication in 1968 by John Bennett, secretary of the 
Victorian Council for Civil Liberties of a booklet called Freedom of Expression in Australia. The title I take it

03:26:38.997 --> 03:26:40.999
sufficiently indicates what the book was about. The point I want to make about it is that although that book contained 
very little, it was new. It was very persuasively, very powerfully argued, very well documented, and widely read in

03:26:46.555 --> 03:26:55.465
influential circles. So there was a timely booklet in 1968. Third, there was a particularly revealing controversy. In 
1968, again, one of the interminable rows that blows up over censorship This case, over the censoring of a Swedish film

03:27:10.882 --> 03:27:18.112
called I Love You Love, some of you might remember. What had happened was that in 1968 the Australian film festivals and 
their committees, which were a pretty active pressure group anyway, had finally after a long battle got special

03:27:18.993 --> 03:27:37.699
permission, special concession to import films without, for showing at film society meetings only, that is to a 
restrictive membership. got the mission to import films without them first, going through the machinery of

03:27:38.135 --> 03:27:45.623
government censorship. Now what happened was that that agreement having been made, the then government, through the 
then Minister of Customs, which of course before Chip, this was a man named Senator Scott, interfered after all. And

03:27:58.497 --> 03:28:03.923
what was revealed here, and the reason I think this particular fuss is more important than the others, was that there was 
a particularly blatant example of incompetent and repressive bureaucracy. What happened was that the Minister for

03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:17.800
Customs alleged that two characters in the film were committing sexual intercourse. One of them was seven months 
pregnant. That was the woman.

03:28:23.669 --> 03:28:33.403
Now, it turned out on inspection of the film, close inspection, discussion with the director, who happened to be in the 
country at the same time, and discussion with the actress. that in fact they weren't committing sexual intercourse at

03:28:33.620 --> 03:28:36.923
all. What's more, it was further established that given that the woman was seven months pregnant and given the position 
they were shown to be in in the film, it was physically impossible that they should have been. At this point, even the

03:28:48.355 --> 03:28:54.721
Sydney Morning Herald was moved to point out the absurdity of a situation. It was removed from remark on the absurdity of 
a situation where so much power lies in the hands of a man who was prepared to make a fuss about sexual intercourse being

03:28:59.219 --> 03:29:08.353
shown on screen, but he couldn't recognise it when it was before his eyes. So that I think that particular round, one of 
the many, had its influence on what happened. Talking finally, in Adelaide detail, there was the publication in 1970 by

03:29:16.805 --> 03:29:26.560
Max Harris and Geoffrey Dutton of a book called Australia's Centreship Crisis. Now, the title, certainly at that time, 
reflected the feeling of urgency that many people have, the sense that Australia, in this situation, essentially was

03:29:27.215 --> 03:29:41.330
at a point of crisis, and that the book was, from that point of view, a very timely one. Now, if you look at the book, you'll 
find that its general tone is strident. You'd expect angry, because you'd expect that the general line of argument is

03:29:47.056 --> 03:29:52.682
very, very hard-hitting. In particular, there was a forcefully argued case against the system of film censorship 
contributed by Eric Williams. This case, again, didn't contain much that was new by way of argument, was heavily

03:30:00.694 --> 03:30:06.521
derivative from the book by Bennett. But it did contain, I think this is important, an absolutely devastating list of 
the films that were presently cut and banned in Australia. And one of the further things that was devastating about

03:30:16.372 --> 03:30:22.399
this, not only just by looking at them and asking yourself what on earth was wrong with that, the service of devastating 
because it actually broke the secret because at that time the names of films that were cut and banned was actually kept

03:30:22.666 --> 03:30:32.857
secret by officials. Williams came up with the obviously well-informed and yet absolutely incredible estimate that 
in 1969, fully one in three of all feature length films imported into Australia had been cut by the censors, one in three.

03:30:54.222 --> 03:31:14.982
Furthermore, he made it clear, what had already been known but had never been quite as obvious as this before, that 
virtually the whole cinematic genre of the horror film was being not cut but banned, excluded entirely from Australia

03:30:54.222 --> 03:31:14.982
on the inexplicable grounds that they were undesirable in the public interest. One of the things that was discovered, 
which not very many people have known, was that it was actually the case that the customs people were working as one of

03:31:15.451 --> 03:31:35.099
their criteria for the banning of films, that films should be declared by them to be undesirable in the public interest, 
so that horror films were something that you simply couldn't see in Australia at that time. Now, what I'm suggesting is

03:31:36.180 --> 03:31:44.732
that those four factors were among the immediate causes of the radical change in Australian censorship that took place 
under Donald Shippon after 1970. And the really crucial changes that he instituted, the changes that make up the basis

03:31:48.111 --> 03:32:00.004
of the present censorship policy, film censorship policy in Australia, were these. It seemed to me to be four. It's 
interesting to note in passing, by the way, that these changes were all either recommended by the writers of the books

03:32:01.385 --> 03:32:11.175
that I've mentioned, All were already current practice, the British Board of Film Censors in England, all both, so that 
the changes the chip made after 1970 were drawn in part fairly obviously from those sources. The four major changes seem

03:32:25.003 --> 03:32:27.927
to me to be these. First, the process of censorship in Australia became open rather than secret. These lists of banned 
and cut films with reasons for the banning or cutting were published and still are being published. Now, it's a great

03:32:41.271 --> 03:32:50.121
pity that after its initial enthusiasm, the Australian press has got rather sick of reprinting these things, so they 
now, although they exist, are a bit hard to find. But more important than this, Chip did something else that had never

03:32:50.862 --> 03:32:55.967
been done in Australia before. And that is that he, as Minister of Customs, as a public figure, began discussing 
censorship publicly, frequently, and intelligently. That is, he made its censorship in Australia begin to look like

03:33:08.210 --> 03:33:16.163
part of a democratic, rather than part of an authoritarian process. This was exactly what John Trevelyan, keeps 
emerging as an important figure in the back of us, had been doing in England for years. One of Trevelyan's favourite

03:33:23.615 --> 03:33:29.104
ploys was to go around the country lecturing especially at universities. The universe is a place where the censor is a 
name that is not held up in great admiration. And Travelling used clearly to enjoy to present himself to large crowds of

03:33:36.142 --> 03:33:43.689
university audiences and wow them. That is so that these people who hated him when they started came away thinking, what 
a marvelous man he was. I might say that I'm the victim of just such a performance, hence my admiration for the man. But

03:33:53.879 --> 03:33:56.762
what Chip did by making it public was to indicate or to make obvious in Australia that censorship is something that 
doesn't just happen out there or up there. He made it obvious that it is something that is done and can be seen to be being

03:34:07.675 --> 03:34:17.026
done by people in the society which we live. That is, it's being done by identifiable people for more or less 
identifiable reasons. So that that seems to me, to make it public seems to me to first and one of the most important

03:34:28.028 --> 03:34:31.974
aspects of the ship revolution. Second, was the introduction after a long process of argument and controversy of the 
R-certificate, the film, that is the adults' own certification. Interestingly, despite what some people, the

03:34:43.332 --> 03:34:51.825
Institute's enemies are saying at the present time, he did this not only against the opposition of the the Attorney's 
General of the various states, but also against the trenchant opposition of the film distribution industry itself.

03:34:59.796 --> 03:35:12.696
But anyway, what the introduction they asked if it could be, and is still doing, is that for the first time in Australia, 
film censorship is done on a basis of using an adult to the standard rather than a child. Third, underchip, the

03:35:14.299 --> 03:35:18.285
Australian film censorship policy was liberalised. Of course, it was made possible by the introduction of the 
R-certificate. And with an R-certificate, it was possible for the censor to release films for adult distribution,

03:35:23.744 --> 03:35:33.388
which had previously in Australia have been either banned or cancelled. It also made it possible for the artistic merit 
criterion to be used for the first time in any serious way in Australian film censorship. And this was a major step that

03:35:44.813 --> 03:35:48.799
I'll be saying something about a little bit later. And the one I've already implied in my view about the artistic merit 
criterion is that I think it's illogical. I think it raises enormous philosophical issues that it works. And it works

03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:10.865
particularly because it allows one to make a distinction between a serious film on whatever subjects and commercial 
pornography. Now, of course, that distinction, if you press it, may then break down in your hands. But you can set it up

03:36:15.607 --> 03:36:24.782
and use it as a criterion, as a distinction, in the practical everyday business of censoring. Because in the practical 
everyday business of censoring, somebody has to sit there and make a decision. Does this thing go through or does it not?

03:36:31.754 --> 03:36:41.530
In a situation like that, a practical, workable standard is perhaps more use than a fully philosophically viable one. 
introduced the concept of community standards as the main basis by which film censorship in Australia would operate.

03:36:51.613 --> 03:37:08.091
And he did this in order to replace the mismatch of older criteria which were based ultimately on the 19th century 
judgement that that which is censurable is that which has the power to deprive and corrupt those who may come under its

03:36:51.613 --> 03:37:08.091
influence. It is the depraven corrupt criterion had been the dominant one in Australia and it was replaced in the 1970s 
by the community standards one. Again, a standard that the British border film censors had been using under John

03:37:17.386 --> 03:37:24.778
Travellian for many years. What this means is that a film may be released if in the judgment of the censorship board By 
taking into account the prevailing normal adult community standards on the subject of that film, then that film, if it

03:37:31.696 --> 03:37:45.823
is in accordance with these prevailing standards, then that film can be released. Once again, you'll notice, and this 
has been pointed out many times, that it's not a criterion that will stand up to close analysis. Because you can't

03:37:53.466 --> 03:38:09.246
measure prevailing normal adult community standards any more scientifically or objectively than you can measure 
artistic merits or, for that matter, any more scientifically or objectively better than you can measure depravity or

03:37:53.466 --> 03:38:09.246
corruption. Once again, I think it's the point that Chip has made himself effectively enough, for all its faults, it's a 
criterion that works. One of its great advantages is that it gives censorship the flexibility to move with changes in

03:38:17.514 --> 03:38:25.408
society. And that's something that the community standards criterion does, as far as I can see, no other does. OK, well, 
that roughly was the ship revolution in censorship as I see it. And I suppose I've made it clear by now that I think we all

03:38:38.705 --> 03:38:43.952
have a reason to be grateful for the man who carried it through. I might add, a reason to be grateful for those in the 
present government who are by and large pursuing the policies that he established. Australia, at long last, it seems to

03:38:51.784 --> 03:39:03.921
me, finds itself more or less in line to censorship practice with the other Western democracies, and particularly in 
line with England and the United States. Now, if that's the point of the chip revolution, it is also the point at which, if

03:39:05.605 --> 03:39:15.361
I can return to this, the debate about censorship changed. As it had already done, and the same thing had happened, it had 
already done six or seven years earlier in England. So I said before, earlier than 1970 in Australia, the debate about

03:39:23.975 --> 03:39:31.647
censorship had been conducted by artists and civil libertarians. They were doing the debating because they wanted to 
see the system changed. Now, what happened was that once the system was changed, these people who had been doing,

03:39:37.971 --> 03:39:48.166
conducting the debating about censorship, fill it to the background. That is, they moved out of the arena of the 
argument about censorship to be replaced by another group. A group who for many years, and for very good reasons, had

03:39:54.357 --> 03:40:02.495
been relatively quiet on the subject of censorship in Australia. After 1970, after the Chip Revolution, these people 
came out fighting. And they're still there, just out there, especially in the city of churches, fighting hard at this

03:40:07.467 --> 03:40:13.480
very moment. I find them a very difficult group to describe, very difficult group to put a name to, but let me just 
introduce the two phrases that I'll use to describe them, hopefully without being too many questions. I shall revert

03:40:24.678 --> 03:40:31.449
them interchangeably as moral reformers or representatives of the moral right wing. Present time seems to me they are 
very active and potentially very important in Australia indeed. A moral reform, as it happens, is a subject that I find

03:40:41.253 --> 03:40:45.699
fascinating. Indeed, there are some people who collect pornography, and I collect anti-pornography pamphlets. So as 
it happens, censorship is of course only one dimension of the work of moral reform. What you find, if you look over your

03:40:58.057 --> 03:41:08.813
history, either in a long or a short term, is that there are long series of organized moral reform movements. that spring 
up in a society whenever the moral dimension of that society is felt to be at a point of change, that in fact, as the way

03:41:09.232 --> 03:41:21.199
moral reform works, is most of the time. There are nearly always moral reform movements around in one area, moral 
behaviour for another. If you look through your history of moral reform in Australia, you get a fascinating story, as

03:41:29.054 --> 03:41:38.266
you'd expect given Australia's fairly lively history. For example, take a few examples of earlier ones. Kind of 
massive moral reform movement in the 19th century, based on the whole issue of Sunday observance. And it was only very

03:41:48.652 --> 03:41:57.868
recently that they lost the Melbourne and the Adelaide Sunday of very recent parts of things that I suppose we all 
remember. The whole series of moral reform movements set up around the question of alcohol in society, the

03:41:58.203 --> 03:42:06.756
prohibitionists who emerge and re-emerge from time to time. Then there were the six o'clock closes in the 1950s and 
early 1950s. There was a great phase in the Australian history. There were the anti-gamblers who were at it again. I see

03:42:16.812 --> 03:42:25.105
now that people, politicians in Australia are talking about setting up casinos in Tasmania and now I gather one Victor 
Harve is it going to be? Matthew Ambue, wherever. Then there were the anti-sea bathers, moral reform movements, who for

03:42:29.971 --> 03:42:40.405
many years kept that great symbol of Australian society empty of the populace, the beach. And when they lost the first 
stage of that battle, when people were actually allowed on the beach to go swimming, they kept them for many years

03:42:40.425 --> 03:42:50.097
further in neck to knee bathing costumes. And of course there are those developers, but that's the current of the area 
that I think that the current problem will be in that sort of historical context. the current crop of moral reformists

03:42:59.172 --> 03:43:02.116
should be sent. Of course, they're not all people of the past. One can see these sorts of movements very actively in 
Australia, but I mean other areas, particularly the groups concerned with who are opposed to the easing or the likely

03:43:04.999 --> 03:43:15.472
proposition of dissent. The divorce laws in Australia should be eased, and of course, there is the anti-abortion 
lobby. If any of you are interested in this, there's a very interesting book about the history of moral reform in

03:43:20.639 --> 03:43:28.909
Australia by a man named Keith Dunstan called simply Wousers. Now, the arts and entertainment, as you'd expect, have 
always been a rich field for these groups of moral reformers, so that their re-emergence at the present time, something

03:43:28.889 --> 03:43:49.481
that anybody who takes an historical view of, just as I'm trying to do, will find their emergence at the present time 
entirely predictable. The history of censorship, in fact, I would argue, is the history of the strength of moral reform

03:43:54.488 --> 03:44:01.958
groups at any given time in a society. Now I would define it. The system of censorship, I would suggest, in any society at 
any time, is a compromise, which is established between the moral reformers on the one hand and the rest of society on the

03:44:03.280 --> 03:44:15.918
other. It has always been so, I believe, it will always remain so, and it's my feeling that in a democratic society, it 
probably should remain so. To make a reference again to John Traveller, he defined censorship, that is, he actually

03:44:29.478 --> 03:44:48.002
offered, he the censor, offered his definition of what censorship was by saying that the role of the censor in any 
society is that of the protector of the arts, the censor as the protector of the arts against what he called grassroots

03:44:48.809 --> 03:44:55.279
Philism. He maintained that if it wasn't for him, the hated censor, it wasn't for him, England would move into a phase of 
intolerable moral repression in the arts. That is, he saw himself the censor as the figure standing between the

03:45:07.760 --> 03:45:21.822
distribution of art as it was in the 1960s, early 1970s, and what he called intolerable moral repression. He saw himself 
as it were the backstop, the protector of the arts. It does seem to me that, as I read, what has happened in England lately,

03:45:25.748 --> 03:45:32.577
that the evidence is on his side. That is, I think his analysis is substantially true. I think there are problems. I think 
one could, in this new age of ours, make the same kind of case in Australia. That, if I can just go back, is essentially why

03:45:41.788 --> 03:45:52.061
my position, the personal position on censorship that I outlined, is that essentially pragmatic ones are not a pure 
one. The censorship system, This is my definition of it now, is a temporary compromise established between

03:45:53.862 --> 03:46:05.157
conflicting social groups at a given time in society. Sensitivity system can be understood and discussed seriously 
and intelligently, it seems to me, only if it is viewed as a social process. If it is seen in its social context as a

03:46:14.349 --> 03:46:23.160
compromise worked up between competing social groups in the society. Now, as it happens, the history of the cinema, I 
can other line on this, in the West, was actually written by the moral right wing. That is, the rise of commercial cinema,

03:46:34.024 --> 03:46:44.916
which we can conveniently date from the 30s, the rise of the commercial cinema prompted a massive outburst of moral 
reform activity. And at that time, the moral reform was one hands down. Now it's from that period, from that period of

03:46:51.018 --> 03:47:00.937
moral controversy and fuss, that the old system of Australian film censorship was established in the first place. And 
that's why, from those origins, it was as repressive as we now know it could be. Furthermore, the success of the 1930s

03:47:07.749 --> 03:47:12.418
moral reformers in America brought about the self-regulation of the motion picture industry in the form of the now 
famous or infamous Hayes Code, which was first written out in the 1930s, and which wasn't seriously challenged from

03:47:12.550 --> 03:47:29.817
within the film industry until Otto Creminger, forced through his own film, 1953, a film some of you might know, called 
The Moon is Blue. Under the controversy, the reason that film was the breakthrough. Now, pathetic to look back, but the

03:47:40.511 --> 03:47:50.964
issue was whether the characters in that film could use the terms and discuss the concepts of virginity and seduction. 
They weren't going to sort of, as it were, They weren't going to do anything about the virginity of the character, and

03:47:54.704 --> 03:48:01.493
they weren't going to engage in seduction in the film. The issue was whether the terms could be used in the script. But it 
was because of the operations of the Hayes Code that Hollywood, through the 30s, 40s and 50s, had that awful stress on

03:48:06.561 --> 03:48:16.915
moral endings, crime does not pay, all the rest of it, all the incredible restrictions on what actors and actresses 
could be seen to be doing on screen. This was the business about the prohibitions of open mouth kissing, the fact that no

03:48:25.851 --> 03:48:44.978
two characters even fully dressed, if our man and female could be seen, could be shown, be in the same bed, or if they were, 
there was a lent out to this one, one of them could have a leg stretched over the side on the ground and that made it okay.

03:48:44.958 --> 03:48:54.282
This was the self-regulatory system that was introduced by Hollywood under pressure from the 30s moral reformers. The 
reason they did it was precisely the reason that Trevelyan described himself as the the barrier between artistic

03:49:01.124 --> 03:49:10.777
freedom of some kind, limited artistic freedom, and intolerable moral repression. They did it. The film industry did 
it itself. Worked the code itself because they felt that if they didn't, if they couldn't be seen to be cleaning up their

03:49:15.604 --> 03:49:26.099
own stable, other people would step in and take action. This was, of course, very likely. Anyway, that particular 
censorship compromise, which of course heavily favored what I'm calling the moral right wing, was maintained for

03:49:28.057 --> 03:49:42.136
fully 40 years until 1970 in Australia. The influence of those moral reformers in the 30s that determined what all our 
film experience until recently was actually like. Now, once the tide began to turn, against the moral reformers, they

03:49:54.483 --> 03:50:01.272
of course re-emerged in a new and active phase. And I'd like to suggest that the process by which this works can best be 
seen by taking the example not of Australia for the moment, but of England. And that one can see the process beginning in

03:50:11.125 --> 03:50:15.951
England in 1964. with the establishment or the formation in the Birmingham Town Hall by Mrs. Mary Whitehouse of the what 
was then called the Clean Up TV Campaign. Cleanup TV campaign which later became and still is called the National

03:50:28.705 --> 03:50:36.136
Viewers and Listeners Association. Mary Whitehouse is the founder and currently the secretary of that organization. 
She's the lady who is coming, the invitation to the festival by others on a lecture tour of Australia later this year. She

03:50:48.555 --> 03:50:53.042
is now, I might add, a very powerful woman in England indeed. One of the things she claims to have done, and there is some 
justice in the claim, is to have won a massive victory against the BBC, as it was under the Director-Generalship of Sir

03:50:53.461 --> 03:51:09.883
Hugh Carlton Green, who retired or resigned rather in 1967. And it's certainly true that with the departure of Hugh 
Carlton Green from the BBC, the cleanup TV campaign's main target The late night satire shows and the famous Wednesday

03:51:19.752 --> 03:51:27.510
plays disappeared with him. Those are things now the BBC doesn't do. Green himself, as Director-General, stood out all 
the time he held office against tomorrow reform is a cleanup TV campaign. He expressed his contempt for them and would

03:51:40.372 --> 03:51:44.357
have nothing to do with it. One of Mrs. Whitehouse's loudest complaints is that under the wicked Sir Hugh Carlton Green, 
she was never invited into the portals of the BBC. She was a member of the public of a democracy like England. Certainly

03:52:00.514 --> 03:52:03.057
true that since his resignation, The BBC has moved away from the experimental phase it was in at that time. It's not just a 
question of the late-night Saturday shows and the Wednesday plays. The BBC's whole output, it seems to me, now is much

03:52:16.164 --> 03:52:24.093
less experimental, much less critical of society than it has been. It's also true that the new director-general, Lord 
Hill, has been much more accommodating. Mrs. Mary Whitehouse on the Cleanup TV campaign, he does things which she knew

03:52:29.942 --> 03:52:45.430
Carl Green never did like reply, polite to her letters, invite her in to talk to him on occasion, and even allow her to 
appear in discussion programs on BBC television. Now, since then, since the early phase of their activities directed

03:52:49.898 --> 03:53:07.097
against the BBC, the activities of the National Viewers and Listeners Association have broadened and that we can now 
see in England, I believe, the shape of a newer and potentially even more powerful movement with worldwide

03:52:49.898 --> 03:53:07.097
connections. The signal moment in this, it seems to me, was the publication in 1972 of the Longford Report on 
Pornography. At its best, in my view, one of the most sophisticated pro-censorship documents that's ever been

03:53:17.196 --> 03:53:23.824
written. That's mixed judgments, by the way. Not only the document, I'd add, but the whole controversy and sort of line 
lines. that the Longford Committee managed to establish it. So one of the curious things about the Longford Committee

03:53:38.291 --> 03:53:43.378
was that it was entirely self-appointed. It is nobody in any position of authority wrote down at any time that this 
committee should establish itself, carry out its investigations and write its report. They appointed themselves,

03:53:52.290 --> 03:54:03.105
they set themselves up, they organized the meetings and publications of the report themselves, though the thing has in 
some strange way, partly perhaps by the title, I don't know, in some strange way sort of taken on a sense of officially

03:54:03.085 --> 03:54:08.491
important. Certainly I thought, when I first heard the publicity for it in the Australian press, that it was a 
government-sponsored publication, which it turns out, indeed, not to have been. So that, I think, is a signal moment in

03:54:19.182 --> 03:54:28.772
the emergence of what I will be describing later as a new phase, moral reformism, the Western democracies. Longford 
Report was preceded and I think influenced by two earlier very important events in America. One was the appearance in

03:54:38.391 --> 03:54:43.926
1970 of Charles H. Keating's dissents. from the President Johnson's commission on obscenity and pornography. I don't 
think the commission report itself is a matter of great significance. I think that Senator Keating's dissent from it

03:54:53.020 --> 03:54:56.185
is. Senator Keating, if you may know, was the President Nixon nominee to the Johnson Commission. At the change of the 
presidency, the commission had been set up, set up and appointed under President Johnson, and that one of President

03:55:02.875 --> 03:55:20.477
Nixon's early acts, after 96 years in New York, was to appoint a nominee of his own onto that commission, and that nominee 
produced a minority report. The second event in America was President Nixon's tension in the angry rejection of the

03:55:20.778 --> 03:55:33.054
recommendations of the report itself, when it finally came up. The rejection contained a surprising number of 
quotations from the dissenting judgment made by child-age kids. The commission itself, of course, recommended that

03:55:47.626 --> 03:55:54.580
All official legislation relating to the circulation of erotic material for adults should be repealed. So that I'm 
suggesting that the Keating dissent and President Nixon's rejection of the Johnson Commission report were important

03:55:55.863 --> 03:56:09.330
events in the background of what happened in England leading up the Longford report. Of course now one can see a further 
step in all this to be the new group on the horizon, something that has grown out of this sort of environment, I might call

03:56:10.053 --> 03:56:25.767
it that, relationship is the ominously titled Festival of Lights. had a succession of very large marches and meetings 
in England and is now organising in Australia, as you no doubt know. There is, I believe, a march for purity coming up

03:56:34.342 --> 03:56:37.227
soon. Now, as it curiously, the target for these new moral reform groups in England, that's a very surprising but very 
critical and important target. The target that these groups are now aiming themselves at, so to speak, is the British

03:56:49.287 --> 03:56:58.411
Board of Film Censors. In particular, they are aiming themselves at the now secretary of the British Board of Film 
Centres, Mr Stephen Murphy, who took over in 1971 when Travesion returned. Indeed, at the present time, a new move, a

03:57:11.228 --> 03:57:26.736
quite revolutionary move, as far as moral reform and the arts is concerned, is an attempt by a representative of these 
moral reform organisations in England to sue the secretary of the British Board of Film Censors and the chairman of the

03:57:27.442 --> 03:57:39.152
British Board of Film Censors for the crime of releasing obscenity, to which the film Last Tango in Paris. It is, I might 
suggest, a very sophisticated and a very, very potentially important legal manoeuvre. It took a brilliant legal mind

03:57:48.020 --> 03:57:55.947
to conceive of the idea of a moral reform group taking the censor to course. Of course, also, if you think about it, 
Croydon also has its comic implications. And not surprisingly then, we see a similar movement emerging in Australia.

03:58:09.983 --> 03:58:25.410
And just as predictably, it first started emerging in Adelaide, whereas it happened the policies of the state 
government here made the break up of the old censorship moral order that much more apparent in South Australia than it

03:58:09.983 --> 03:58:25.410
was elsewhere. I mean, one could fairly say, I suppose, that a state like Victoria, when the Office of Attorney General 
was held first of all by Sir Arthur Ryler and then by Mr Ma that were friends like that who needs a moral reform movement.

03:58:39.533 --> 03:58:49.686
Anyway, to mark the change in what happened, we see that all the new publications on the subject of censorship in 
Australia are from the right. And I have them here. If anybody would like to see them afterwards, I'm thinking in

03:58:52.349 --> 03:58:57.735
particular of no, no, Calcutta, why? Facts and figures. Changing community standards, J.H. Corby. Stand up and be 
counted. I just bought that yesterday, that's very nice. Stand up and be counted by J.H. Corby in association with Ms.

03:59:12.525 --> 03:59:13.367
Helen Caterham. Now, the main spokesman, as I see it, for the new kinds of moral reform movements in Australia at present 
time, is indeed the same J.H. Corby. He is certainly the Maine, in some ways the most impressive, though that's another

03:59:26.512 --> 03:59:34.079
qualified judgment, most impressive spokesman for these movements in print. He is, by the way, among other things, 
Vice President of the Community Standards Organization. He's also the vice... National Vice President of the

03:59:41.245 --> 03:59:50.533
Community Standards Organization, right? And he is also Chairman of the Australian Festival of Life Committee in 
South Australia. Whether he is going to be the one who emerges as Australian equivalent of Mary Whitehouse remains to be

03:59:56.498 --> 04:00:03.609
seen. But I offer this prediction with absolute certainty that if he doesn't, somebody will. The movement, I suggest, 
is crying out for a leader and it will find one. The Community Standards Organisation, by the way, is an interesting side

04:00:13.998 --> 04:00:24.490
issue about that, is the now name of what was originally called the Moral Actions Meeting. There's a very interesting 
parallel between that and what happened in England where the Cleanup TV campaign changed its name to the National

04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:33.300
Viewers and Listeners Association. It does seem that in the early phases of moral reform movements, there's a kind of 
rhetorically and militramatic impetus which leads to these rather startling titles for organizing the Cleanup TV

04:00:35.783 --> 04:00:54.542
campaign indeed, but that as they get older and more mature, there seems to be a need to make themselves sound that much 
more respectable. Certainly, community standards organization sounds a mild thing compared to a moral action

04:00:54.563 --> 04:01:00.829
committee. Now, I don't propose at this stage to enter into the lists with a detailed critique of the arguments and the 
activities of the current crop of moral reformers, though I must say that I find it tempting to do so. It's easy to make fun

04:01:14.085 --> 04:01:15.106
of them. The point I want to make tonight is that it is a good deal easier still to underestimate their potential 
influence, to underestimate what they can do. I want to round off this talk by noting that For all its similarities to

04:01:29.767 --> 04:01:43.046
this one, the current moral reform movement seems to me to have some portentous new features about it, which probably 
deserve to be treated very seriously indeed. Now, as I said, it used to be very easy to make fun of moral reform movements

04:01:44.588 --> 04:01:54.542
and make fun of their leaders and their organization or their disorganizations, as usually the case, and of their 
publications. In Australia, this was particularly easy and of course was a, for years, a favourite game by liberals and

04:01:55.012 --> 04:02:12.615
intellectuals because moral reformers tended to be isolated cranks, people who were completely ignorant of the 
complexities underlying the the simplistic stances that they took on critical issues. Or alternatively, they tended

04:02:17.364 --> 04:02:23.635
to be politicians who had a gift for sending themselves up. You all remember, I suppose, Sir Arthur Ryler's 
contribution to the debate about the group, referring to his non-existent teenage sons and daughters who he didn't

04:02:23.655 --> 04:02:34.755
want to see reading that book. And then there was still is, to that matter, the red Brisbane dentist, whom you've no doubt 
heard, Alan Russell, the man who has to his achievement, the fact that he Brisbane, the African dance group a few years

04:02:34.735 --> 04:03:01.738
ago, that he Brisbane alone, Australia the girls have to wear Braziers, the man who when the federal government 
released Lolita, Lady Chatterlene and two other books, sent a telegram, that famous telegram, to all federal empties

04:03:01.718 --> 04:03:08.850
in Canberra, which reads, in parts. If Australia's moral decline is to be halted, the present malfunctioning 
censorship machinery operated by four intellectuals and most academics must be replaced by a common sense

04:03:09.912 --> 04:03:25.718
down-to-earth body drawn from average homes, not university, hot houses, stock. Men like that, one doesn't I suggest, 
have to take very seriously. What I do want to argue is that these new groups are different. And they're different partly

04:03:36.356 --> 04:03:47.993
because, and I find this myself slightly paradoxical, they are different in part because they are themselves, the 
products of this democratic, officious, Sorry, this democratic, efficient, commissive, mass media dominated

04:03:48.648 --> 04:03:57.684
society that they themselves are so busy attacking. Let me put this into a number of stages. First, they seem to need to be 
different and more significant than early immoral reform organizations movements because they are organized to a

04:03:59.948 --> 04:04:11.989
degree that I've never come across or seen before. Crucially, what has been recognized by the modern crop of moral 
reformers is that they cannot convert people straight up to their point of view via rhetoric. But what they can do, and

04:04:24.212 --> 04:04:34.770
can do effectively, is operate successfully as self-consciously political pressure groups in a society. It seems to 
me that that is the way they have now defined their role, not as converters of the reluctant masses. Of course, they claim

04:04:41.951 --> 04:04:51.402
that the masses are on their side anyway, but as self-consciously political pressure groups working within the 
society. Now, this seems to me to have three implications for the way they work and three implications that have been

04:04:51.422 --> 04:04:58.010
followed through. First, the new moral reform groups. have recognised that they must operate on a narrow rather than a 
broad front. No more huge statements, at least not crucially, that they depend on huge statements about how society is

04:05:06.962 --> 04:05:14.311
falling apart. They still say that, but that is no longer their real thrust. They have realised, it seems to me, that 
their campaigns must have specific achievable goals. It's very different from saying that you are going to clean up TV.

04:05:29.058 --> 04:05:31.004
You're going to do something much more specific than that. For example, they've learned to attack key vulnerable 
individuals. instead of fulminating just against the system. The National Viewers and Listeners campaign was not, I

04:05:40.691 --> 04:05:48.843
suggest, against the BBC, but against the Hugh Carlton Green, and that is a crucial difference. Even though, as we all 
know, big institutions like the BBC, in fact, made of the ABC, are vulnerable to pressure. It is individuals in system of

04:05:55.773 --> 04:05:58.858
power within them. who are the really vulnerable beings. And, of course, it takes a degree of sophistication, not 
previously common among moral reformers, to know the system well enough to be able to recognize the critical and the

04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:18.288
potentially weak points of authority, like the Director General for the BBC. His significance in the same way that 
their target in relation to film censorship in Britain is the figure of the Secretary himself. Stephen Murphy. It is

04:06:29.218 --> 04:06:36.032
even more significant that they have begun to move against the British film censorship at a point where it is weakened. 
Nobody in England could have touched John Traveller. He was too established. He'd been there too long. He was too good.

04:06:43.628 --> 04:06:48.117
What happened was that the moment he resigned, the moral reformers moved against him. his successor, a younger man, a 
man without the experience he had for all those years. And they moved at beautifully chosen points. The two films I

04:06:57.436 --> 04:07:03.709
picked that he was faced with making decisions just after it was a nasty thing for Travellian to do, I suppose, to resign 
just then. But God probably didn't know. Well, I bet he did. The two films that they made issues of, just at the point when

04:07:09.305 --> 04:07:16.492
the office was taken over, were two really crucial ones. Kubrick's Clockwork Orange, wouldn't you know, and Sam Feck 
and Paz's Draw Adults. Two films over which there has been an enormous fuss in all the sides of the universe. Now, these

04:07:27.103 --> 04:07:35.232
were the points at which the new, what I've described as the new moral reform groups, the new specific moral reform 
groups, moved. So that you get this attack on vulnerable individuals. I would suggest that there was evidence in

04:07:39.259 --> 04:07:54.385
Australia that the groups here were already beginning to move against the individual figure of Donald Chipp, who was of 
course in a vulnerable position, as sensitive minister of the Liberal Party. Had he been censorship minister of a party

04:07:54.365 --> 04:08:10.534
of the Labour Party, what would be the use of the Labour Party, of the ripples he would have been safer, but that he was in a 
vulnerable position, what I'm suggesting is that people were beginning to raise a campaign against his policies and

04:08:10.514 --> 04:08:13.178
against himself in that state. So what I'm arguing here is that there's a new sophistication in the way that moral reform 
movements pick out the right targets, the way they restrict the field in which they're going to operate to identify for

04:08:13.238 --> 04:08:29.201
themselves achievable, distinct goals. Secondly, since these moral reform movements pride themselves on working 
within the law, They have now learned to hire very sharp lawyers indeed, and have learned in fact to use the law to their

04:08:37.632 --> 04:08:48.726
own purpose. I have, I would suggest, brought off some brilliant coups. I have an enormous admiration for the mind that 
lay behind the discovery and the use of the injunction in the field of censorship, the device that was used in South

04:08:52.812 --> 04:09:06.930
Australia over the banning of Ocalca. That was a very, very sophisticated piece of work indeed. They were lucky, of 
course, one of the judges sent them up, one of the others only agreed with them apparently reluctantly. They got away

04:09:18.005 --> 04:09:20.128
with it and made a major coup. And of course they succeeded again with the film in the same way, with the film of Oak 
Calcutta working on the assumption, and they're probably right, that the distributors of that film won't take them to

04:09:29.320 --> 04:09:48.467
court because the distributors who don't care about freedom of expression or are anything else, obviously, will 
probably not bother taking them to court because the money they can't make in Adelaide, they will recoup in Brisbane,

04:09:29.320 --> 04:09:48.467
Sydney, Melbourne, wherever. You know, the charities. In England, as I've already suggested, the same kind of work 
showing or the same kind of new enthusiasm, new skill evident in the idea of suing the sensor. That's an apparently

04:10:02.210 --> 04:10:05.116
fantastic idea. But in England, to take another example, it's been known for years now that the National Viewers and 
Listeners Association has been waiting for a television program to come out which their lawyers will tell them they can

04:10:05.136 --> 04:10:24.133
take to court and have some hope of winning an obscenity case. It's absolutely unheard of to take a television program, 
particularly if it's going to be a BBC television program, and it will be if it happens. Be sure of that. The idea of taking

04:10:33.626 --> 04:10:40.515
a BBC television program to court for an obscenity case is another brilliant stroke. Of course, one of the reasons, and 
this is another indication of this sophistication, I suggest, one of the reasons that such a program hasn't appeared is

04:10:48.835 --> 04:10:52.902
precisely because everybody knows they're waiting.

04:10:57.950 --> 04:11:09.690
I just noted passing there, by the way, another indication of sophistication, but these people now really also know the 
law and know where its weak points are as far as they're concerned. So if you also find very skillful campaigns being

04:11:14.620 --> 04:11:18.064
started up over specific concepts of law. In Australia, if you read through the works of J.H. Court, you'll find that two 
such points, in Australian law and Australian practice, that he has no worked out quite sophisticated arguments

04:11:21.087 --> 04:11:37.906
against, are precisely the artistic merit criterion in censorship and precisely the community standards criteria. 
These are small, crucial battles which can be won. Third, These people nowadays really use the organisations that they

04:11:44.101 --> 04:11:48.255
have. Some of the ploys that they use, a tradition on familiar ones, but on an organised basis they can be very effective 
indeed. Let me just read out to you. The list of suggestions that J. H. Court offers in his book, Changing Community

04:11:57.044 --> 04:12:07.615
Stairs, in a chapter called, interestingly, What Can I Do? Now the proposition in this chapter is that the reader, the I, 
is a person who is deeply concerned about the corruption of society and all that. The argument is that normally people

04:12:16.984 --> 04:12:23.491
are out, you know, we're all concerned about the corruption of society, but normally in our apathy we just sit back. Now 
what we find now, groups who would set out a long list of pieces of advice to this person in the community. First, he is

04:12:31.846 --> 04:12:35.353
advised to be informed about the issue. Now that would be a major change. The people who were concerned about the moral 
corruption of society took the trouble to find out what they were talking about. It would be almost as if we'd moved into

04:12:42.507 --> 04:12:45.613
another society. Second, letters to the painter. We all know that three letters to a newspaper can look like a massive 
swing from public opinion. Third, phone your television studio. We all know, again, especially the ABC and on this day

04:12:57.929 --> 04:13:06.640
tonight, particularly, ten phone calls can jam the switchboard and look like a public revolution. Fourth, use and make 
use of the radio talk back program. There's a smooth operation for you. A huge audience available to every one of us and

04:13:13.604 --> 04:13:19.193
people being advised to use it. Fifth, call the TV station manager. Now, exist that you get past that bird, let's say a 
channel 10 who's always hanging up the phone on your list, does whenever I phone the radio. and insist that you get

04:13:31.088 --> 04:13:41.807
through the manager and he of course again is a man in a vulnerable position who must at least put on a show taking account 
public opinion. Write letters to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. There's a move forward too. I can think of

04:13:47.282 --> 04:13:57.643
moral reform movements in Australia which would never have heard of an organisation like the Australian Broadcasting 
Control Board and certainly not know the enormous power that it actually has. That is in fact the case that, again, an

04:13:58.063 --> 04:14:02.833
impression of a large public. Upsurge could lead to action by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which could 
be very important. Contact the TV sponsors of programs you don't like. There's a beauty. If you don't go to the station,

04:14:16.373 --> 04:14:22.120
you go to Hine's soup or whatever and say, look, I'm a member of the public. I'm buying your stuff, but by God, I'm not going 
to buy it anymore if you keep sponsoring number 96 or this day tonight or whatever it is that they happen not to like. Right

04:14:32.513 --> 04:14:43.975
to MPs, councillors, especially local councillors, we all know how that works, involve yourselves actively with 
political groups in the society. The Democratic Labour Party at the last election adopted as its main policy an

04:14:44.343 --> 04:14:49.550
anti-permissive. It was, of course, a disaster. As we all know, political disaster, the DLP. I'm not suggesting that 
anything of this kind was behind it. Nevertheless, it's an indication of how effective that kind of action could

04:14:58.221 --> 04:15:03.028
possibly be. I've been waiting for the floodgate storm. It was in last December. Is that in there? They never do. The 
trouble with floodgates, as far as one can tell, is a nice one. Right, actively involve yourself, sorry, join pressure

04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:18.420
groups, we know about that. Use petitions. Well, now this is an old ploy, but it has a nice tag to it. Right, petitions to 
parliament, preferably well presented, that's their thing, but then quote, preferably well presented, and quote,

04:15:22.507 --> 04:15:34.768
preferably with the assistance of mass media coverage to publicize the issues at stake. I don't know who's been 
learning from who there, but that isn't the technique that the left-wing demonstrators use. So, successfully, I don't

04:15:41.671 --> 04:15:49.925
know, and an indication that whatever else is happening these days, a new moral reform movement is willing to learn from 
experience. That seems to me, by the way, a very subtle and very sophisticated move, again. And there's suggestions

04:15:54.432 --> 04:15:59.541
further that the concerned eye in the society can go up, and try and convert to the cause the local branches of already 
existing organization. Specifies, for example, the RSL, I might find a few supporters there, Rotary Women's Clubs,

04:16:05.193 --> 04:16:23.959
certainly the Country Women's Association Victoria, has an anti-committer plan on its platform already, Parent 
Teacher Association School Council.

04:16:29.356 --> 04:16:43.055
A

04:16:29.356 --> 04:16:43.055
program that doesn't take much imagination, one to be able to see, could be, and you do it on the example of England, can be 
seen to be being very effective indeed. In fact, in England, the curious situations of the censorship She worked there a

04:16:48.442 --> 04:16:50.104
little bit differently. The British Board of Film Censors doesn't have the power of the customs department here. It 
doesn't have the power of law. It is in fact financed by the industry. Now what happens is that the British Board of Film

04:16:59.795 --> 04:17:14.331
Censors gives a certificate to a film and what was discovered quite by accident by somebody in 1967 was that the ultimate 
power lies with the local authorities. Now, in the case of Joseph Strict's Ulysses, what happened was that the British

04:17:14.969 --> 04:17:21.158
border film censors banned it. And as I said that this film cannot be shown in England. The London local council decided 
that they approved of the film and put it on. Put it on even though it hadn't been passed by the British Board of Film Censors.

04:17:33.761 --> 04:17:37.027
What's happening now is a lovely reversal of that. Where the British Board of Film Censors have passed last time we were in 
Paris, straw dolls, top work orange and the devil. Those are the crucial four cases. What's happening now is that there

04:17:45.941 --> 04:17:50.308
is an organised letter writing campaign to the local authorities scattered all over the country, to no individual 
sympathetic to the cause, giving the impression, again, this huge swing of public opinion, saying this time, not that,

04:17:50.288 --> 04:18:07.329
you know, I feel like this should be released, but it should be banned in that area. This, again, is a, for instance, is 
going to move indeed. Stephen Murphy claims, this is nobody has found, I don't know, has yet tested, actually claims

04:18:11.715 --> 04:18:18.203
that he had evidence to establish that this activity is going on. And what he's claimed in the letter to the Times, signed 
officially from his own name with his rank, is that there is, by quote now, material is centrally compiled, that is, in

04:18:21.157 --> 04:18:41.845
the country by the main organisation, the National Viewers and Listeners Association, centrally compiled and then 
distributed to regional members who are invited invited to write individually to local authorities and thus to create

04:18:42.466 --> 04:18:50.860
an impression of spontaneous public dismay. It's a very, very, again, a very neat move, an indication of a very 
sophisticated understanding of the way the system works. Finally, the last comment I want to make about the new moral

04:18:59.755 --> 04:19:07.748
reform movements is that these people, in my view, have paradoxically gone through a process of education in the 
toughest of all debating schools, that is in the public eye of the mass media. And that unlike earlier moral reform

04:19:17.470 --> 04:19:23.762
movements and the representatives thereof, they have learned by experience. It is now quite common, for example, to 
see civil libertarians, often people of some intellectual bent and background, people like this being eaten up in

04:19:24.400 --> 04:19:47.792
public debate, by people who they clearly regard as easy targets, by ladies like Mary Whitehouse herself, a kindly 
provincial middle-aged housewife who gives every appearance of being so. one of the most frightening things I've ever

04:19:47.772 --> 04:19:49.578
seen. I think to see her simply eat on television, uh, sophisticated intellectuals who clearly think she's an easy 
target. The difference is that she has learned in the hard school of public television. One of the things about the new

04:20:01.524 --> 04:20:07.090
moral reformer is that he or she is placed directly in the public light. Not a question of standing back in your dentist 
surgery in Brisbane and writing letters or sending telegrams. You are drawn up into the public eye. You simply have to

04:20:15.860 --> 04:20:22.487
learn your facts, to learn your arguments, get them straight and to be able to handle them. And this I suggest is what 
happened. England seems to make the moment to be strewn with the bodies of liberal intellectuals who thought people

04:20:25.057 --> 04:20:32.747
like Mary Whitehouse were easy targets. I think that it's clear, as one looks at the material with the Moral Action 
Committees have put out, that they've reached the stage of sophistication where they are prepared to have a sort of

04:20:34.330 --> 04:20:50.459
list, if you will, of different kinds of arguments to suit different kinds of audiences. I suppose we're all familiar, 
even in Australia, with the Moral Reformer, who comes to the State of the University.
