00:10.900 --> 00:18.000
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.000 --> 00:20.220
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.500 --> 00:26.720
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.740
The subject of this show is world building.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.700
Let's define what world building is.

00:37.940 --> 00:47.240
First, I'd have to say that the author has to build a world starting probably from what type of star it orbits around.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.060
Not many authors go to that much trouble though.

00:51.220 --> 01:07.460
They may mention the star, the particular kind of system a planet is in, but in the past it's usually been the practice that an author will, if he's interested in adventure, in alien contact, in simply exploration, he'll have his people end up on a planet,

01:07.460 --> 01:10.600
he'll have his adventures take place, his battles, his discoveries, whatever.

01:11.420 --> 01:19.160
But not much will be given to the planet, what kind of a planet it is, what kind of a world it is, how it's different from Earth.

01:19.680 --> 01:29.840
And many times in that kind of story, the world, the other planets discovered will simply be similar to Earth, or the author won't explain why or how they are different.

01:29.840 --> 01:38.620
Yeah, in a world building type novel, the important, one of the important things is why the world is different and how that benefits the story.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.900
Right, and an author can end up accidentally making mistakes.

01:42.640 --> 01:49.660
If he doesn't do the research to back up what kind of world he has, he may mention something that is physically impossible.

01:49.660 --> 02:02.040
And this gets into what Hal Clement calls the game in seeing how precise he can make his world and how well he can make it fit to what are presently known physical laws.

02:02.600 --> 02:06.840
And the reader of course tries to pick out any mistakes that he may have made in the process.

02:07.340 --> 02:11.480
Hal Clement, you mentioned his use of the term game applied to world building.

02:12.040 --> 02:15.380
In one of his essays, I think he actually challenged the reader.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.920
He said, in essence, he said, okay, I've written my story.

02:18.020 --> 02:20.300
I've done it as scientifically true as I could.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.380
It's up to you to see if I've made any mistakes.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.800
Right, I think that article appeared in the astounding science fiction in 1953.

02:28.540 --> 02:32.160
It was added on as an addendum to his book, Mission of Gravity.

02:32.720 --> 02:41.360
And it does deal with that particular novel in the world of Mesclon, which has got to be one of the most incredible world-built worlds ever written for science fiction.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.180
At the end of that, he says something like, I couldn't possibly think of all of these things in advance, all of the different, he's talking about all the different criteria of the planet.

02:51.120 --> 02:56.720
Time and time again, a section of the story had to be rewritten because I suddenly realized that things couldn't happen that way.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.140
I must have missed details, of course, and that's where your chance to win the game comes in.

03:03.320 --> 03:03.840
Music

03:13.880 --> 03:21.320
Paul Anderson has also written many of his books with the techniques of a world-builder, and he's written articles on it also.

03:21.500 --> 03:25.500
And I think that he shares Campbell's interest and Clement's interest too in realism.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.620
Paul Anderson, I think, emphasizes that this is something that's just for fun.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.960
I think he said once that planet building is one of the joyous arts, if you have that sort of mind.

03:36.580 --> 03:44.900
He said the object is to construct a strange world which is at the same time wholly consistent, not only with itself, but with what science knows of such matters.

03:47.640 --> 03:52.200
Yeah, it also takes a very serious approach, I think, to science fiction.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.800
You have to be interested in realism, first of all, to be a world-building author.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.820
You also have to have some scientific background.

03:59.420 --> 04:07.520
Perhaps it doesn't have to be as extensive as a science teacher or a true scientist would have, but you still have to know what you're talking about, for instance, in constructing a sun.

04:09.020 --> 04:11.500
What brightness is a sun going to be? What classification?

04:12.740 --> 04:18.040
An F-type star, like, or an F or a G? I think this, our sun is a G-type star.

04:18.680 --> 04:23.340
With that kind of intensity, what sort of planets would be revolving around that sun?

04:24.540 --> 04:34.080
Given a certain amount of metals or minerals on the planet, certain types of minerals or metals, what would be the mass, the density of the planet, the gravity, what kind of flora, fauna?

04:35.080 --> 04:44.120
It sounds rather restrictive, but really there's a lot of latitude there that an author can use to change up his stories and give a lot of different backgrounds.

04:45.980 --> 05:00.640
Anderson remarked that a science fiction author who's interested in world-building can feel like a god or a creator, and I think that's true almost in a literal sense, because he can say, let there be light, and imagine or create a particular kind of sun.

05:01.540 --> 05:11.120
And then from there, you can go on, create the planet, create the circumstances of the planet, the beings on it, create a culture, anything he wants to. It's a very god-like procedure.

05:11.840 --> 05:17.300
I think he also said that it might be good therapy for the kind of mental patient who thinks he's a god.

05:18.760 --> 05:27.900
Yes, but I think there's a value to a reader with a world-built novel, too. A solid one, I think, can be an educational and refreshing experience for its reader.

05:28.920 --> 05:37.080
We tend to think of man as the center of the universe, the most important creature in existence, of our world as the center of creation.

05:37.680 --> 05:45.020
And science fiction authors have gotten into the rut of making other worlds similar to Earth, but they must be different.

05:45.540 --> 05:53.220
They would certainly have different suns, different mineralization, different kinds of flora and fauna, and they wouldn't be similar to Earth at all.

05:53.800 --> 06:00.040
But an author who carefully constructs a different and consistent world can cause us to see ourselves differently.

06:00.900 --> 06:05.540
We are not unique. We're not the only life form, not the only world possible.

06:06.640 --> 06:15.340
And when we see a well-done world-built novel, we realize that things out there are going to be different, and it might give us a sense of humility, a freshness, a sense of wonder.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.900
I think that's probably the greatest value of science fiction.

06:18.960 --> 06:25.780
But an author has to do that well. I think that any science fiction author who writes of other worlds is, in a sense, world-building.

06:25.780 --> 06:29.660
But what we're talking about here is a degree to which he does it.

06:30.040 --> 06:36.100
He has to do it seriously and consistently, and with a type of depth that will make a difference in the story.

06:36.160 --> 06:42.140
There has to be a reason for the kinds of details that he constructs or makes his world from.

06:43.060 --> 06:53.500
Yes, and in fact, we have a situation here where this kind of science fiction writer is subject to the old rule of the more that you can control,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.500
the more you must control.

06:56.280 --> 07:04.640
And so it is his responsibility to make sure that all of his details are as correct as he can make them in order to make the story more realistic.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.420
And I would say that they all have to contribute something to the story.

07:08.540 --> 07:11.540
They can be there simply for realistic purposes, yes.

07:12.120 --> 07:15.740
But I think they also should have some kind of contributing effect to the story itself.

07:27.540 --> 07:32.940
One well-known science fiction author who uses world-building to a fairly large extent in his work is Frank Herbert.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.320
The book Dune, of course, is one of the greatest of all science fiction novels.

07:38.500 --> 07:50.820
Basically, he makes his world of Arrakis a desert planet, and the lack of water is probably the most important thing that the people on the world, the humans have to deal with.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.360
There's an ecology theme in the work.

07:55.240 --> 08:00.940
But the novel really revolves around the fact that you're on a desert planet, so the world-building there would be of some importance.

08:03.340 --> 08:10.360
Anne McCaffrey also uses world-building in the extent that forces on her world of Pern are governed by the solar system in which it's located.

08:10.360 --> 08:21.440
When the planet Pern comes in close contact with its sister planet, called the Red Star, a spore-like creature passes from the Red Star to the planet and wreaks havoc upon the planet's surface.

08:22.540 --> 08:29.820
And then you could say that she uses a world-building concept in the entire solar system in which this story takes place.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.480
Paul Anderson is very serious about the world-building business.

08:47.280 --> 08:53.780
He's written an article entitled The Creation of Imaginary Worlds, The World Builders Handbook and Pocket Companion.

08:55.220 --> 09:00.740
He's followed the precepts in that article with his first world-built novel, his first attempt at it.

09:01.140 --> 09:06.540
The original title of the work was War of the Wingmen. It was later reissued as The Man Who Counts.

09:07.540 --> 09:13.040
He wrote it really as The Man Who Counts. It was published under that unfortunate title.

09:13.840 --> 09:21.740
And later on, as he became more sophisticated and well-known, they republished it with the correct title, Man Who Counts.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.480
It's the first time that we meet the character Nicholas Van Rijn.

09:25.220 --> 09:28.140
And the planet, of course, that he writes about in that novel is called Diomedes.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.860
And it has one startling creature on it, I guess, startling to us anyhow.

09:33.860 --> 09:37.740
These creatures are almost the size of men, and they can fly. They have wings.

09:39.040 --> 09:43.080
Now, this would be impossible on Earth. This is an example of the world builder doing his homework.

09:43.580 --> 09:52.360
On Earth or any kind of planet that would have our gravitational pull, there's a certain size limit beyond which a creature could not fly, would not have wings.

09:52.720 --> 09:58.700
So on this Earth, a winged creature, say much larger than an albatross or a condor, would be almost impossible.

09:58.700 --> 10:05.040
But on Diomedes, Anderson is so carefully constructed that world that these intelligent creatures can fly.

10:05.700 --> 10:10.280
This is one of Anderson's forte, I think, is flying intelligent creatures.

10:10.860 --> 10:15.540
These would apparently be rare in the universe, and they're rarely done in science fiction.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.120
But Anderson handles this several different times in different ways.

10:19.780 --> 10:25.600
On Diomedes, one of the ways he can allow this to happen is that the world has no metals on it.

10:26.520 --> 10:31.660
Its mass is about the same as Earth's, but the lack of metals cause it to be much lighter, less dense.

10:32.940 --> 10:38.160
The atmosphere, the composition of the gases in the atmosphere is such that the air is denser.

10:40.140 --> 10:47.440
And therefore, these Diomedians, these winged creatures, are able to use their huge wings to fly.

10:47.840 --> 10:51.880
And their whole culture is determined by their world, the planet that they're on.

10:51.880 --> 10:57.760
For instance, the fact that they have no metal causes these flying beings to have a stone age technology.

10:58.540 --> 11:02.360
They can't manufacture any kind of technology based on metals.

11:03.980 --> 11:10.300
The tilt of the axis of Diomedes is almost 90 degrees. The poles would be on an elliptical plane.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.680
And this causes huge polar caps.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.460
And strange seasonal, or at least seasonal fluctuations would be strange to us.

11:19.460 --> 11:22.300
This causes these creatures to have to migrate.

11:23.240 --> 11:26.960
The seasonal changes cause them to migrate to bear their young and so forth.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.920
And the whole culture, Anderson, has very cleverly worked it out.

11:30.740 --> 11:34.640
Whereby their way of life is based upon the world they live on.

11:35.700 --> 11:41.360
In the story, the man who counts, as we mentioned, we see Nicholas Van Rijn for the first time.

11:41.480 --> 11:45.500
He's one of the leading traders of the Polysac Technic League.

11:46.600 --> 11:52.540
And he is stranded on this planet. They've come to investigate it for potential trade purposes.

11:53.260 --> 11:58.700
And they become stranded. Their spaceship has crashed on the surface of the planet, in the ocean.

11:59.840 --> 12:04.440
The crew has very little hope of survival of getting off the planet.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.820
If it weren't for the wiles and the cunning of Nicholas Van Rijn, they wouldn't have.

12:09.800 --> 12:16.800
Nicholas has no qualms about causing a war between different factions of the wing creatures

12:16.800 --> 12:20.200
to facilitate his removal from the planet.

12:20.680 --> 12:27.180
And he proceeds to do so with quite a bit of ingenuity and intentional humor also.

12:28.520 --> 12:33.740
I think in that book Anderson is definitely not obtrusive with his world-building statistics.

12:33.740 --> 12:40.060
Authors can sometimes be obtrusive, go a little too far in giving you numbers and statistical information.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.120
You can get in the way of the story.

12:41.340 --> 12:46.660
But this is in the background. It's there, it's helpful. In fact, Nicholas Van Rijn uses his knowledge of these people.

12:46.900 --> 12:52.160
Their physiological makeup, the way they base their culture on the planet itself to achieve his ends.

12:53.920 --> 12:58.840
But Anderson was involved in another project, which I think was not quite as successful as this novel.

12:59.800 --> 13:03.080
He wrote a book entitled A World Named Cleopatra.

13:04.340 --> 13:08.300
And it's probably one of the deepest and most thorough attempts at world-building that I've ever read.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.820
The setup itself was very interesting.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.360
The book consists of four long short stories by different authors.

13:17.560 --> 13:21.960
They all take place on a planet called Cleopatra at different times in its history.

13:22.880 --> 13:29.000
And at the beginning of the book there's an essay by Anderson in which he sets up the characteristics of the planet.

13:29.860 --> 13:33.960
He tells you what kind of planetary system it's in, the type of sun.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.400
It happens to be an F7 type sun.

13:37.260 --> 13:43.280
The statistics on the planet, the biology, the plants, the animals, the kinds of satellites around it, everything.

13:43.580 --> 13:46.080
In very great detail, about a 15-page article.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.680
And then he sort of says, go to it.

13:49.080 --> 13:53.160
You know, you authors write your stories based upon these statistics that I've given to you.

13:54.180 --> 13:58.100
Anderson himself writes the first story, and I think that probably is the best one.

13:58.580 --> 14:05.920
He chronicles the adventures of the original landing party from Earth, a group of scouts who found this planet, Cleopatra, two men and a woman.

14:06.940 --> 14:11.140
The conflict among them is, are they going to develop this planet?

14:11.140 --> 14:16.780
They treat it as a fresh, uninhabited Eden-like planet.

14:17.780 --> 14:21.640
Biologically, it's similar to Earth in the Mesozoic period, way back in the prehistoric days.

14:22.700 --> 14:26.280
And their conflict is, are we going to open it up? Are we going to destroy it?

14:26.680 --> 14:32.920
There doesn't seem to be any intelligent life on it yet, although there's one creature vaguely humanoid who seems to be making tools.

14:34.180 --> 14:40.220
But the basic conflict of that first story by Anderson was simply, we have a world here like Eden, are we going to change it?

14:40.240 --> 14:41.320
Are we going to do anything with it?

14:42.180 --> 14:47.840
The other three stories in the volume, one by Michael Orgill, one by Jack Dannon, another by George Zabrowski.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.060
I didn't think they were that successful.

14:52.260 --> 14:57.020
They pick up on Anderson's statistics, the way he's constructed the world.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.160
They base their stories on the data that he's given them.

15:00.780 --> 15:06.520
But I don't think they reach the level of writing that you'd expect from a good, world-built novel.

15:07.400 --> 15:12.340
I think Anderson had a much better feel for the world that he created than the other authors who wrote about it.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.660
That may have been the problem.

15:16.080 --> 15:21.260
A world-built novel can't rely on just the world to pull it through.

15:21.540 --> 15:22.760
It has to have a good story.

15:23.400 --> 15:29.580
And really the story should come first in terms of what's written down for the reader to read.

15:29.580 --> 15:36.380
The world can be a valuable asset to creating a realistic and believable background.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.760
But of course the story comes first.

15:39.380 --> 15:45.200
This I think was brought out in an article by George R. R. Martin that was written for the Science Fiction Writers Association.

15:46.400 --> 15:55.800
And he mentioned some of the works of Hal Clement and others as possibly the world that was built getting in the way of the story.

15:55.800 --> 16:01.420
And that this might be a negative thing in the aspects of world-building.

16:02.620 --> 16:09.560
One thing he mentioned was that world-builders are like artists who spend years designing frames and then hurriedly paint a picture to put in them.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.100
Sometimes it works, but not often enough to justify the procedure.

16:13.980 --> 16:21.960
Whether or not we agree with that, that is a valid thing to consider if someone is going to write a world-built novel.

16:22.600 --> 16:29.000
I think he's got a good point in the fact that sometimes when authors do write a story with world-building as a precept,

16:29.220 --> 16:36.680
they tend to make the world one of the main characters in the story rather than simply the background in which the story takes place.

16:37.060 --> 16:41.160
That it sort of overshadows the plot or the aliens or the inhabitants of the world sometimes.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.560
That's his opinion, of course.

16:44.320 --> 16:50.500
I enjoy Clement's main work, The Mission of Gravity, the one that he's basically talking about in this article.

16:50.500 --> 16:54.320
Clement himself is a teacher of science, I guess you could call him a scientist,

16:55.160 --> 16:58.180
and he's gone to great pains to make this world believable.

16:58.820 --> 17:02.060
His planet, Mesclan, is to an earthman a very strange world.

17:02.700 --> 17:09.360
It's not round, it's oblate, shaped more or less like an egg, and it spins very rapidly.

17:10.200 --> 17:16.120
The gravity at the poles is so intense that an earthman of average size would weigh 60 tons.

17:16.120 --> 17:20.140
At the equator, he probably would weigh about three times his normal earth weight.

17:21.460 --> 17:25.940
And of course, The Mission of Gravity as the title indicates, gravity is the overwhelming force of the novel,

17:26.380 --> 17:30.400
and the major characteristic of the planet that the earthman have to deal with.

17:31.360 --> 17:41.020
But Clement has, I think he's had fun trying to imagine and create the kind of intelligent life that could live on a planet with gravity so intense.

17:41.900 --> 17:47.560
And he's done that with the mesclanites, who are caterpillar-like creatures,

17:47.960 --> 17:51.740
probably about 15 inches long with pinchers.

17:52.720 --> 18:00.480
The culture that he's given them, the way of life, everything about them I think is extremely realistic, and they're very interesting aliens.

18:01.740 --> 18:10.880
I think in some respects that he's taken these aliens and he's taken just earthmen and earth-type traits and put them in an alien costume.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.180
I think this is one of the things that Martin suggested about the novel,

18:15.320 --> 18:20.120
is that the aliens were not really realistic, that they were not alien, they were human.

18:22.020 --> 18:27.460
But on the other hand, he's gone to a lot of trouble Clement has in making those aliens psychologically different.

18:27.460 --> 18:35.000
For instance, they don't have any buildings because they are extremely afraid of something falling on them.

18:35.600 --> 18:42.740
All they do, if they want any kind of cover at all, they'll put a piece of cloth, no more than two inches off the ground above them,

18:42.800 --> 18:44.680
because they're afraid of things falling.

18:45.380 --> 18:47.540
Probably a six inch fall would kill them.

18:49.400 --> 18:54.820
They have never seen anything thrown, you know, launched from an arm or a hand, this is alien to them.

18:54.820 --> 18:58.400
And when they see something thrown by an earthman for the first time, it astounds them.

18:58.900 --> 19:03.200
Now that kind of psychology is tremendously different than what an earthman would have.

19:04.180 --> 19:07.340
And I think that makes the aliens, among other things, very realistic.

19:08.680 --> 19:14.960
Also, if you recall the first time that the earthman, I think Lackland was his name, the one who lands on the planet,

19:15.040 --> 19:16.700
he stays in his lander because of the gravity.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.240
But one time he had to lift one of the mescalonites, Barlonon.

19:21.500 --> 19:26.400
It's the first time that Barlonon had ever been lifted, been off the ground.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.740
And he almost went mad, he almost went insane.

19:29.300 --> 19:35.580
In fact, the other creatures, I think, almost attacked the earthman because they thought that he had killed their captain.

19:38.640 --> 19:44.500
So to me that's an example of creating a different creature, an alien,

19:44.680 --> 19:47.340
one who thinks differently, whose psychology is totally different.

19:47.340 --> 19:52.760
And I think it's consistent with the kind of strange atmosphere, at least strange to an earthman,

19:52.920 --> 19:54.080
that Clement has set up on that world.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.740
If you remember also, there's no water on this planet.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.760
The seas are methane.

20:04.260 --> 20:10.560
The planet spins so rapidly that the days are only 17 minutes or 17 and a half minutes long.

20:13.500 --> 20:18.240
And the basic plot of the novel, I think, is an interesting one.

20:19.300 --> 20:28.020
The basic plot of the novel, not to elaborate too much, is that the earthmen are having the mescalonites

20:28.020 --> 20:36.660
explore the planet for heavy metals, and the mescalonites are trying to obtain some of the earthmen's high technology.

20:36.660 --> 20:44.100
And they eventually come to a compromise in that the mescalonites are going to be providing some of the raw materials

20:44.100 --> 20:50.960
that the earthmen need and the earthmen are going to be providing the advanced technology that the mescalonites are striving for.

20:52.000 --> 20:59.860
One interesting thing I think that Clement did here is that he based this particular planet on a real star system.

21:00.760 --> 21:05.020
Some authors make up their own stars and some authors use a real star system.

21:05.020 --> 21:13.860
In this case, I think he chose a 61-signi, and at the time that he wrote this, there was a question as to whether there might be a dark body,

21:13.980 --> 21:17.720
which could or could not be a planet circling around this star.

21:18.460 --> 21:24.940
If it was a planet, it would have to be very dense, and so he took it from there and created the planet mescalonite.

21:25.600 --> 21:32.840
I think it's probably ultimately up to the particular reader as to whether he thinks the planet obtrudes into the story.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.100
You know, if Clement goes too far with it.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.560
But I thought there was a good plot to it. There's adventure.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.940
We see most of it from the point of view of Barlin and the native mescalonite, this caterpillar-like creature.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.400
And his job is a very difficult one. It's fraught with danger.

21:48.760 --> 21:54.220
He has to be a courageous, heroic being to do what he has to do in that novel.

21:55.440 --> 22:01.840
And I think Clement has given us a feel of what it would be like to be on a planet with such tremendous gravity,

22:01.840 --> 22:08.420
the difficulties that would occur, the things that have to be done to survive, to exist, to fulfill a task that he has to fulfill.

22:09.700 --> 22:13.760
I believed. I didn't think the statistics or the data got in the way of the story at all.

22:24.900 --> 22:31.760
Another novel we might consider in the category of world building would be Larry Niven's famous novel Ring World.

22:32.680 --> 22:37.580
Here we have an artificial world that's been created by Larry Niven.

22:38.060 --> 22:43.020
It's a very unusual world. I don't think anything has ever really been written quite like it.

22:43.760 --> 22:56.740
It's completely non-natural. The entire structure where these creatures lived at one time, and some of them still do, at the time of the novel,

22:57.080 --> 23:02.940
was created from the raw materials of the solar system that once existed around this particular star.

23:04.760 --> 23:13.220
I think in that novel Ring World, a picky person might question whether it's a world-built novel in the sense that Anderson and Clement conceive of one.

23:15.500 --> 23:19.860
Niven is more of an engineer, I think, in the book rather than a creator.

23:20.140 --> 23:31.540
As you said, it's not a natural world. It is complete unto itself, and the creatures on it are what tied into the ecology and the way the world has been set up.

23:32.500 --> 23:37.780
But I'm not sure I'd call it a world-built novel in the sense that it was a natural thing.

23:38.780 --> 23:42.580
I think some people might argue with you on that point.

23:43.620 --> 23:53.080
Really, a world-building novel, the term world-building, I think comes from the author's point of view rather than whether the world itself is really a natural one or not.

23:53.640 --> 24:05.920
I think Niven has created a world here. It is an entire ecosystem, something that these creatures were going to depend on for all of their existence in a physical sense.

24:05.920 --> 24:12.820
He created this thing as an entire habitat circling a star just as a planet would be.

24:13.380 --> 24:24.180
In fact, Larry Niven himself is caught up in this same game that how Clement's been talking about that he made some mistakes, even physics mistakes,

24:24.620 --> 24:28.860
concerning the world that he built that some of the readers caught him on.

24:28.860 --> 24:36.020
And in his sequel to the novel, The Ring World Engineers, he worked out solutions to some of these problems.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.880
I might give you a brief description of what The Ring World is actually like.

24:40.480 --> 24:51.300
The Ring World is a giant band, a ring around a sun, the distance between the sun and the ring being that approximate distance between the earth and the sun.

24:52.360 --> 25:00.760
The ring has mountains along the inside about a thousand miles high on each side to contain the atmosphere, set the ring rotating about 770 miles an hour,

25:01.280 --> 25:09.360
and it creates a gravity on the inside of the ring of about one G, populated with various animals and peoples.

25:10.600 --> 25:18.940
And you have an environment with about three trillion times the surface area of the earth.

25:18.940 --> 25:24.940
With this expansive environment, Niven could postulate several different kinds of stories to take place on The Ring World.

25:25.340 --> 25:30.740
Especially one that is no longer as organized as it once was when it was built.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.780
It was obviously very well organized in order to be built at all.

25:34.320 --> 25:43.480
But now the engineers who built The Ring World are no longer there apparently, and everything has fallen into a state of disorder.

25:43.480 --> 25:55.200
There are many mutations and many things that have gone wrong all over the different areas of The Ring, which of course gives a great lot of source material for adventurous stories.

25:56.320 --> 26:05.020
As long as we're talking about the artificial type of world building, I think we should at least mention a book by almost a brand new science fiction author, John Barley.

26:05.260 --> 26:06.120
The book is called Titan.

26:07.120 --> 26:11.760
The title Titan comes from the, I guess you'd call it the main character of the book.

26:11.780 --> 26:14.540
It happens to be an artificially constructed planet.

26:15.720 --> 26:21.440
It's contacted and entered by an earth crew scouting for life in the solar system.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.520
And they find out that this planet has been made.

26:25.100 --> 26:33.040
It looks natural. It's got soil. It's got trees, many cultures, oceans, continents, different kinds of flowers, different kinds of creatures.

26:33.860 --> 26:39.420
And at first they don't realize that it's artificial, but the planet itself is alive.

26:39.920 --> 26:45.380
There's a sentience, a creature behind it who is making things happen, who is creating things on that planet.

26:45.980 --> 26:52.680
And it's a very interesting approach, I think, to, you might even call it halfway between an artificially built world and a naturally built one.

26:53.960 --> 27:02.020
The final novel that we'll consider as a world built book will be the novel Big Planet by Jack Vance.

27:03.480 --> 27:11.320
But Big Planet's an adventure story. It has good guys, bad guys, fair maidens, heroism, human enemies, monsters, all sorts of things.

27:11.820 --> 27:15.300
But the core of the plot is a journey across the planet.

27:15.980 --> 27:20.880
40,000 miles, this group of earth people have to go to save themselves.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.260
And their enemies are out to stop them.

27:24.400 --> 27:28.420
Now the planet is called Big Planet for a reason. It has two qualities of significance.

27:28.420 --> 27:33.740
The first being that it is big. It's huge, and this affects the novel in a lot of ways.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.580
The mountains, the plains, the rivers, everything is on a huge scale.

27:39.780 --> 27:45.920
Secondly, there is absolutely no metal on the planet. There is no technology there for.

27:46.260 --> 27:52.800
The inhabitants cannot use anything that would be made from metal. They have to depend upon wood, leather, stone, and so forth.

27:53.560 --> 27:59.640
Now the gravity of the planet is very close to earth gravity because of the lack of metals.

27:59.920 --> 28:03.640
Even though the planet is huge, the gravity is close to earth because of this fact.

28:04.480 --> 28:16.160
And I think probably the hallmark of the novel is the ingenuity of Vance in detailing the culture of a planet of that size without any metals.

28:16.740 --> 28:20.220
How would people achieve any kind of civilization without metal?

28:20.220 --> 28:22.600
How would they progress? How would they build?

28:23.580 --> 28:29.940
And he does that with great delicacy, great depth and sophistication, I think.

28:30.080 --> 28:41.680
For instance, to travel. They've erected this huge monoline system of towers from mountain peaks to plains all over the planet with monolines, filaments between the towers.

28:41.680 --> 28:48.260
And they can travel over these lines in aerial carriages with sails on them.

28:48.780 --> 28:52.060
And they're able to cross great distances with this.

28:52.840 --> 29:00.800
But it's always a pleasure to read a book by Vance because he does such a fine job in detailing alien cultures, their way of life, their differentness from earth.

29:02.220 --> 29:08.440
And I think Big Planet would very definitely qualify as one of the better world-built books.

29:15.860 --> 29:17.300
This is David Cruz.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.260
Darrell Lane.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.180
And David Carson.

29:20.520 --> 29:31.720
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a presentation of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association in conjunction with KOCV FM and Odessa College, Odessa, Texas.
