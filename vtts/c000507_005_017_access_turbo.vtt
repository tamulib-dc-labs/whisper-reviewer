Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.440 --> 00:33.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.320
And here are your hosts.

00:43.060 --> 00:50.880
This is Daryl Lane and David Crews. Norman Spinrad has strong opinions about
science fiction and its place in today's world. As a noted author who helped

00:50.880 --> 00:58.740
bring the science fiction new wave to this country, and as two-time president of
the Science Fiction Writers of America, Spinrad's ideas should be heard. One

00:58.740 --> 01:07.700
thing he feels strongly about is that science fiction has not been treated
fairly by book reviewers. As a category, you know, it is treated very unfairly

01:07.700 --> 01:19.540
and very cavalierly by the powers that be, which is mainly the New York Times
Book Review and the New York Review of Books and the so-called New York Literary

01:19.540 --> 01:27.740
Establishment, which really does have a very heavy effect on the way books are
published. These people, for instance, came down on the American Book Awards,

01:27.920 --> 01:36.820
succeeded in getting science fiction knocked out of the American Book Awards. A
real small clique of people in New York City who felt that it was really bad to

01:36.820 --> 01:44.520
have these awards given to things like science fiction, that it was bad to take
it away from a small jury which they could control and have thousands of people

01:44.520 --> 01:55.080
voting for. A very elitist, social fascist bunch of people who I have absolutely
no use for. And I'm sure they have no use for me. As president of the Science

01:55.080 --> 02:03.500
Fiction Writers of America, Spinrad has worked for some changes in the field.
One thing that I'm already halfway through getting done is to internationalize

02:03.500 --> 02:10.700
it, is to have an overseas region with an overseas director on our board of
directors. Because science fiction writing and publishing really is an

02:10.700 --> 02:19.300
international community. American writers sell their work all over the world.
English writers sell their work here. Foreign language writers have different

02:19.300 --> 02:26.380
problems. And we're all dealing with the same publishers. It certainly is an
international literature. And it's a spirit of the future and the spirit of

02:26.380 --> 02:34.440
internationalism and so forth. I felt it should be an international
organization. That's one thing. The other thing that I want to do and halfway to

02:34.440 --> 02:41.980
doing is upgrading the Nebula Awards. We have moved it out of the Warwick Hotel.
We're moving it into a much bigger room in the world often trying to make it

02:41.980 --> 02:52.060
into a more significant event than it has been. Again, orienting it towards the
world at large rather than towards the little in-group. Spinrad has always been

02:52.060 --> 02:58.300
concerned with the image science fiction has with the general public. He thinks
general readers should be made more aware of science fiction's unique

02:58.300 --> 03:07.280
possibilities and its genuine value. We asked him if science fiction movies have
a positive or negative influence on the public's image of the field. Oh, I don't

03:07.280 --> 03:17.620
know. I don't think they... Not really. I mean, the image of science fiction in
that respect has been very bad anyway. I don't think the movies really add to

03:17.620 --> 03:24.980
the image. But I don't think they detract from it either. If there were some
better, more sophisticated movies, they might help. Well, as it is, it's just

03:24.980 --> 03:33.840
kind of neutral publicity, people more aware that it exists. I think it's
positive, and it will prove to be positive in the long range, because a lot of

03:33.840 --> 03:41.200
people are being introduced to the imagery of science fiction, with which they
were unfamiliar through these movies. And if you look at the evolution in the

03:41.200 --> 03:48.420
movies, you find that in the earlier science fiction movies, if you're going
into space or whatever it is, you have to spend like half an hour setting the

03:48.420 --> 03:55.940
thing. This is a spaceship. It takes off from the Earth. People float around it.
You know, and you have to familiarize the audience with all this unfamiliar

03:55.940 --> 04:04.600
imagery. Now they can just start a movie, bang, right off, in a galaxy far away.
Boom. Here's a spaceship in the Stromo. Pow. You know, in other words, the first

04:04.600 --> 04:12.280
half hour of the conventional old-time science fiction movie is gone, because
people are now familiar with this imagery. And I think these movies have brought

04:12.280 --> 04:22.740
a lot of new people into familiarity with these images. They've made these
images part of the popular culture. These movies have been mainly aimed at kids

04:22.740 --> 04:34.480
and adolescents. And years from now, assuming that these people ever read
anything, they'll be ready to read science fiction of a more serious kind,

04:34.700 --> 04:41.780
assuming they're ready to read literature of a more serious kind at all, because
they'll be familiar with the material, familiar with the literature. It won't

04:41.780 --> 04:51.000
seem strange and weird to them because they will have grown up with it. That's
why I think magazines, even magazines like Starlogs, in that sense, will have a

04:51.000 --> 04:55.920
long-term positive impact. More with Norman Spinrad on our next show.

05:03.020 --> 05:11.140
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

05:11.140 --> 05:11.900
Odessa, Texas.

05:57.600 --> 06:01.620
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:17.660 --> 06:23.120
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.560
And here are your hosts.

06:32.520 --> 06:41.660
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. Norman Spinrad's best-known novel may be Bug
Jack Barron, a book which has stirred controversy in both England and America. It

06:41.660 --> 06:49.460
was published in this country in 1969, and it's a different sort of science
fiction novel. It's a good example of new-wave science fiction. Character and

06:49.460 --> 06:57.520
style are important, and it deals with social issues such as racism, the
establishment, drugs, the power of the media, and radical protests. There is

06:57.520 --> 07:04.460
also a good deal of sex and violence in the book, and the language is highly
colored. But Spinrad thinks the plot of the book conforms to traditional science

07:04.460 --> 07:14.480
fiction formulas. Actually, what I was trying to do in a way, the book has a
very traditional plot. As far as I was concerned, it has a positive hero, it has

07:14.480 --> 07:23.680
a negative villain. The hero wins, the villain loses. All that stuff that is
considered, you know, the traditional way of plotting a book, and yet it's

07:23.680 --> 07:33.920
written in a different kind of way. It kind of takes that superficial kind of
plot and treats it in a realistic manner. The protagonist, Jack Barron, is a

07:33.920 --> 07:41.480
powerfully influential television star who has a talk show watched by 100
million people. He uses the show as a battlefield to oppose corrupt elements of

07:41.480 --> 07:49.260
society. Spinrad comments on Barron's use of power. The book is about power.

07:50.300 --> 08:01.200
Power itself is neutral as far as I'm concerned. It's what people do with it
that counts. Barron is a guy who likes power and keeps referring to it as a drug

08:02.120 --> 08:12.560
and knows that he can become addicted to it and for that reason has decided to
stay away from it. Then he gets drawn back into playing with power because he

08:12.560 --> 08:20.800
comes to the conclusion that it's better for somebody who feels that way about
power to be wielding it than people who don't have any self-consciousness about

08:20.800 --> 08:31.620
the dangers of wielding power. So in that sense, it's a comment on the power of
the media, but it's also a comment on the morality of power, on the paradox of

08:31.620 --> 08:43.480
power, which is that if you leave power to be wielded by people who do not see
the dangers, the personal dangers, the psychological dangers of being involved

08:43.480 --> 08:54.120
with it, then you end up with people like Benedict Howard, Ronald Reagan, and
Richard Nixon who do not have self-consciousness about the personal dangers, the

08:54.120 --> 09:04.760
moral dangers of chasing after power, whereas somebody like Barron, who is
certainly an imperfect person, as all people are, at least his saving grace, if

09:04.760 --> 09:15.940
he has one, is that he is well aware of the personal dangers of being involved
in a quest for power. When Spinrad tried to get the novel published in this

09:15.940 --> 09:24.120
country, he was unsuccessful, so he tried in Britain. But there was an outcry in
Parliament against the book. He relates the story for us. That novel had a lot

09:24.120 --> 09:32.940
of trouble. It was written under contract to Doubleday, who then rejected it.
You know, you have to remember the political climate of the era. They didn't

09:32.940 --> 09:42.220
reject it. They said, we'll publish it if you cut out all the sex, all the swear
words, and all the politics, which was, you know, the whole book. So it took a

09:42.220 --> 09:49.860
long time to resell that book here. In the meantime, I took it to Milford, to a
Milford conference, and Mike Moorcock was there, and he read it, and he liked

09:49.860 --> 09:59.120
it, and he serialized it in New World. So his first publication was actually in
England, in the magazine. Now, halfway through the serialization, I forget

09:59.120 --> 10:08.500
exactly which part, part three, part four, W.H. Smith, which was the biggest
distributor, still is the biggest distributor in England, refused to distribute

10:08.500 --> 10:17.920
the magazine because of the book. Now, at that time, New World had an Arts
Council grant, and the Arts Council was an organ of the British government. Now,

10:17.960 --> 10:27.340
the Arts Council supported the magazine against Smith publicly, and so the flap
in Parliament arose when certain right-wing members of Parliament were aghast

10:27.340 --> 10:38.460
that an organ of the British government, the Arts Council, was defending this
kind of stuff, and that's how it became a parliamentary issue. Bug Jack Barron is

10:38.460 --> 10:46.080
being made into a movie with a screenplay by Harlan Ellison and direction by
radical filmmaker Costa-Gavras. It should be interesting. More with Norman

10:46.080 --> 10:47.360
Spinrad next time.

10:54.620 --> 11:02.780
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

11:02.780 --> 11:06.220
Odessa, Texas. 

11:50.220 --> 11:54.240
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:10.380 --> 12:15.820
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

12:18.580 --> 12:20.260
And here are your hosts.

12:24.840 --> 12:32.480
This is Daryl Lane and David Crews. Norman Spinrad's 1979 science fiction novel,
A World Between, signaled a change in his fiction.

12:42.520 --> 12:46.680
A World Between is also a socially oriented novel, but there's a difference...

12:58.440 --> 13:13.280
...for an element in it. Spinrad explains. I would say in general that up until,
I guess, A World Between, really, a lot of my stuff was kind of critical

13:13.280 --> 13:24.200
fiction, critical of this, critical of existing societies, critical of various
things that were going on. A World Between is meant as a utopian novel, really,

13:24.340 --> 13:34.900
in any kind of way, and it's a prescriptive kind of book. It's more of
a...instead of presenting critical images of other things, the idea is to create

13:34.900 --> 13:45.640
a more positive image of a more positive kind of future. I think if you spend
enough time criticizing what exists, at some point you'll have some kind of

13:45.640 --> 13:53.040
moral obligation to present something more positive and replace what you find
negative.

13:57.780 --> 14:05.720
The setting for the novel is a fit one for a utopia. It takes place on the
planet Pacifica, a beautiful world of blue ocean and lush green islands that's

14:05.720 --> 14:13.340
been colonized by humans. Inhabitants of Pacifica live private lives in their
isolated islands. There are no large urban centers to cause pollution,

14:13.560 --> 14:21.140
overpopulation, or poverty. Even though they are physically isolated, the
Pacificans remain in close electronic contact with one another. They govern

14:21.140 --> 14:29.200
themselves, in fact, with a tight media web that allows them to vote immediately
on any issue of importance. But into this idyllic world comes two opposed

14:29.200 --> 14:38.000
political forces from Earth, bent on the ideological conquest of Pacifica. One
force is the Institute for Transcendental Science, a powerful organization whose

14:38.000 --> 14:49.940
goal is galactic unity under their control. They are extreme, and Spinrad says
they have two basic flaws. One is the unexamined, subtle male chauvinist bias of

14:49.940 --> 15:02.700
their culture. And the other one is the ultimate conviction that what they are
doing is the absolute most important thing in the universe, and that therefore

15:02.700 --> 15:19.180
they are morally entitled to run over other people's cultures and dishonors.
Absolutism, I guess, would be the kind of theocratic absolutism, would be their

15:19.180 --> 15:28.320
flaw. The other force is the Femocrats, a militant women's liberation group that
is also an extreme. The struggle of these two groups for control of planets all

15:28.320 --> 15:36.080
across the galaxy is called the Pink and Blue War. It's clearly a male-female
conflict, and so far every planet the two sides have approached has ended up on

15:36.080 --> 15:45.080
one side or the other. But Pacifica is different. Spinrad's utopia is a stable
and intelligent one. The Pacificans reject both extremes and even change the

15:45.080 --> 15:53.980
minds of a few of the combatants. We asked Spinrad about reactions to the book.
How did women, for instance, respond to the Femocratic women's livers? The

15:53.980 --> 16:08.080
strange thing about the reaction to that book has been that a certain number of
men have reacted in a kind of male-liberal guilt, male-feminist kind of reaction

16:08.080 --> 16:17.940
against that. For the most part, women have liked the book. Women have
identified with it more than men. And actually, I even got one or two good

16:17.940 --> 16:27.060
reviews in feminist places. I think that's not quite what I expected, but that
seems to be the way it happened. I have not gotten heavy feminist flack from

16:27.060 --> 16:37.280
that. A little bit, but not much. Not much, because I think women who are
involved in feminism, or have been, or know women who are, can recognize a

16:37.280 --> 16:47.040
certain aspect of the feminist movement in the Femocrats, whereas men who are
trying to show how liberated they are would not dream of admitting such a thing.

16:47.040 --> 16:52.440
A world between. A different sort of book for Norman Spinrad, and we'll have
more on him tomorrow.

16:59.860 --> 17:08.020
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

17:08.020 --> 17:08.800
Odessa, Texas.

17:54.680 --> 17:58.740
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:14.920 --> 18:20.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.980
And here are your hosts.

18:30.120 --> 18:39.340
This is David Crews. And Daryl Lane. Norman Spinrad's most recent novel, Songs
from the Stars, was published by Simon & Schuster in 1980. The book describes a

18:39.340 --> 18:47.540
fragmented future society in a world devastated by nuclear war. This, of course,
is a typical Spinrad theme. But the novel also communicates the sense of wonder

18:47.540 --> 18:55.880
characteristic of good science fiction when it describes the marvels of contact
with an alien civilization. Society is split in two factions in Songs from the

18:55.880 --> 19:03.920
Stars. One faction is an Aquarian society which bans all technology, in fact,
anything having to do with science, since this was what was responsible for

19:03.920 --> 19:11.640
almost destroying the Earth. And the other faction are the black scientists who
keep technology alive and maintain an illicit smuggling operation with the

19:11.640 --> 19:21.600
Aquarian society. Spinrad talks about these opposed factions. It's a book
against duality. I mean, you have two fragmented societies. They're both...

19:24.560 --> 19:36.060
Both are kind of like half-societies. So the Aquarian society there is a very
nice thing that works, except it really only works because it accepts something

19:36.060 --> 19:51.300
from the black scientists, which it doesn't want to admit that it's accepted.
And the black scientists are, again, another kind of absolutism, which doesn't

19:51.300 --> 20:03.340
sell it. It's a kind of a... It's a book about higher unity, I guess. As usual
with Spinrad, the book's conflict reflects current social conditions. And then,

20:03.440 --> 20:11.460
you know, it mirrors the present thing in our society, where on the one hand you
have a great big space movement and people wanting to get into space and all the

20:11.460 --> 20:21.240
old people and all that stuff. On the other hand, you have a real atavistic neo
-Luddite movement, an anti-nuclear movement, which is really kind of willfully

20:21.240 --> 20:28.620
ignorant of a lot of things. In a way, these are the two things that could bring
about the crash.

20:32.080 --> 20:42.780
And as well as what would survive it. So I think it's basically a book about...
The grand philosophical attempt of that book is to try and bridge the gap

20:42.780 --> 20:55.600
between science and reason and, you know, feeling emotion and mysticism. And to,
you know, to point to a higher unity between the two things and away from the

20:55.600 --> 21:04.740
false dichotomies and false dualisms, which seem to be really destroying Western
civilization, that's a long statement. The protagonist in the book is a laid

21:04.740 --> 21:12.320
-back Aquarian, Clear Blue Lou. Along with his girl and a scientist, he travels
up to a satellite circling the Earth. There, the three of them receive

21:12.320 --> 21:20.420
communication from some incredibly advanced alien civilizations in another part
of the galaxy. With the knowledge sent by the helpful aliens, it seems the

21:20.420 --> 21:28.080
humans will solve their own problems, unite, and start progressing toward the
stars once more. We asked Spinrad that if and when we contact an alien

21:28.080 --> 21:39.320
civilization, is it likely they will be helpful rather than hostile? As I said
in the book, I do believe that any civilization that's going to last a million

21:39.320 --> 21:46.560
years, it's going to be a million years or whatever, or even a hundred thousand
years more advanced than us, that have been around that much longer, that much

21:46.560 --> 21:55.360
more advanced science, if it's going to survive for that length of its own
history, it's got to solve it, you know, it's got to be, by that time,

21:56.580 --> 22:06.020
philosophically and emotionally pretty together, or long since it destroyed
itself. I mean, we certainly will not survive a million years of our own history

22:06.020 --> 22:14.860
if it continues as it has, you know, in order that any civilization that
survives a million years of its own history has had to have gotten its

22:14.860 --> 22:29.160
political, psychological, and philosophical act together. And I don't see why,
you know, you know, and I do believe that if and when we run into that kind of

22:29.160 --> 22:39.040
really advanced civilizations, that they will, if not be directly actively
helpful, certainly will be benign and will not be interested in either eating us

22:39.040 --> 22:48.580
or conquering our planet or blowing us up or anything like that. Songs from the
Stars is a thoughtfully written book with a theme, but it's also good, exciting

22:48.580 --> 22:49.280
science fiction.

22:57.040 --> 23:05.280
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

23:05.280 --> 23:06.060
Odessa, Texas.

23:53.560 --> 23:57.540
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

24:13.280 --> 24:18.620
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and
fantasy.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.000
And here are your hosts.

24:27.540 --> 24:35.860
This is David Carson and Daryl Lane. James P. Hogan's latest novel, Voyage from
Yesteryear, is a fascinating blend of computers, space exploration, and genetic

24:35.860 --> 24:42.760
engineering. It's about a robot probe that discovers a habitable planet ten
light years from Earth. But it's different than the usual probe imagined by

24:42.760 --> 24:51.820
science fiction authors. Right. This one is equipped to manufacture human
beings. Hogan explains. We read a lot of stories about starships that go on long

24:51.820 --> 25:01.740
voyages that take maybe centuries. And inevitably they've got frozen bodies or
bodies in suspended animation or something like that. But when you think about

25:01.740 --> 25:09.240
it, it seems rather an inefficient way to say, you know, if they're not doing
anything, the machines can fly the ship. The computers can get it there. The

25:09.240 --> 25:18.860
people aren't doing anything about it except, you know, just lying there
freezing. So, you know, why not let the machines fly the ship and make the

25:18.860 --> 25:29.660
people when you get there? If we look at the progress made in molecular biology
and genetic engineering in the last couple of decades, we already manufacture

25:29.660 --> 25:38.760
quite complex organic molecules to specifications, such as drugs and certain
anesthetics. If we just extrapolate that a little further, who's to say you

25:38.760 --> 25:47.640
couldn't make a complete set of human DNA? In other words, instead of sending
bodies and all the support equipment to freeze them and taking up all the space,

25:47.640 --> 25:52.380
why not just store

25:52.380 --> 26:05.740
all the genetic information necessary to make people electronically in the
computers and create them when you have found a planet that the instruments say

26:05.740 --> 26:14.240
they could survive on? So the computers make a race of humans, raise them, and
place them on the planet. It sounds a bit mechanical, a little inhuman perhaps,

26:14.580 --> 26:29.020
but Hogan thinks it could work out beautifully. So here's the interesting
possibility of a race that evolves from a first generation of embryos that were

26:29.020 --> 26:40.120
created and nurtured and raised by computers and robots, a machine-raised race.
And when you think about it, the relationship between the children and the

26:40.120 --> 26:50.440
machines does not really have to be a cold and sinister one at all. It could be
quite a charming and amusing one. The interesting thoughts that the book starts

26:50.440 --> 26:57.360
to play with is, here's a race of kids that are being raised by some

26:57.360 --> 27:09.840
very rational, direct, down-to-earth entities who don't double-talk or deceive
or have all these layers of human game-playing that we have to contend with. And

27:09.840 --> 27:15.860
they're being raised completely without

27:15.860 --> 27:28.440
any exposure to the conditioning of conditioned adults with their prejudices and
hatreds and taboos and a lot of the other nonsenses that make life so

27:28.440 --> 27:37.980
complicated in our society. As you might expect, these machine-raised humans are
eventually contacted by humans from Earth. Let's imagine that a mission from

27:37.980 --> 27:39.440
Earth eventually shows up.

27:42.460 --> 27:53.360
Virtually a big mission. This is a 20-year voyage, maybe. So we're talking about
a spaceship that maybe houses 20,000 people, virtually a space colony with

27:53.360 --> 28:04.660
engines, with its government, its military, its church organizations, its
commercial institutions. The whole of society in miniature with its time-proved

28:04.660 --> 28:18.960
mechanisms for controlling and subordinating a population, which traditionally a
ruling elite through history has imposed itself by restricting the flow of

28:18.960 --> 28:31.660
wealth and by offering protection either from real or imagined threats. So what
happens when a race of machine-raised people eventually collides with a race of

28:31.660 --> 28:39.940
people-raised people? And that's really what the story's all about. Voyage from
Yesteryear will be out in paperback at the end of July. Next week we'll have a

28:39.940 --> 28:41.820
series of shows on the works of James B. Hogan.

28:48.760 --> 28:56.600
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin
Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in

28:56.600 --> 28:59.020
Odessa, Texas.
