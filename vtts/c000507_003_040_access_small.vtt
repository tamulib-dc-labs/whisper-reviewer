00:01.560 --> 00:01.880
Okay?

00:02.240 --> 00:02.560
Okay.

00:02.700 --> 00:03.380
You got the tape going?

00:03.600 --> 00:04.080
The tape is rolling.

00:05.500 --> 00:08.780
Okay, what I've done, Mr. Knight, is simply to, as I said, you've done so much.

00:08.820 --> 00:13.420
You've been so involved in the field that it was hard to get a handle on how to approach

00:13.420 --> 00:13.640
this.

00:13.740 --> 00:16.420
But what I've done is sort of divide up into different areas.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.460
And I'll ask you some brief questions on each one.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.540
And the first one would involve your entry into science fiction.

00:22.840 --> 00:27.260
You came through the fan structure, and I wondered if you could explain how you were

00:27.260 --> 00:28.020
introduced to that.

00:28.780 --> 00:32.380
I sort of thought that might come up, and I was rooting about it really yesterday.

00:35.460 --> 00:41.000
Actually, I was thinking, what if you asked me, what do I attribute my gigantic success?

00:41.180 --> 00:42.500
I would have to say mostly luck.

00:43.600 --> 00:49.500
I can trace my career back through a series of just astounding coincidences, really unlikely

00:49.500 --> 00:52.580
things, all the way back to Louis Gernsback.

00:53.500 --> 00:57.540
And I can demonstrate that at each of these points, if something rather unlikely had not

00:57.540 --> 00:59.120
happened, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing.

01:00.220 --> 01:04.560
For instance, if Hugo Gernsback had not come to this country from Luxembourg when he was

01:04.560 --> 01:12.940
14, and started a magazine called Amazing Stories in 1926, you'll see as I go on that

01:12.940 --> 01:14.080
none of the other things could have happened.

01:14.260 --> 01:19.280
So, here I am, a 13-year-old kid in the River of Auric and reading science fiction magazines,

01:19.520 --> 01:20.680
really turned on to let him.

01:21.460 --> 01:28.240
And through the back pages of one of these magazines, Super Science Stories, then edited

01:28.240 --> 01:35.180
by Frederick Bull, I found out about fanzines and wrote away for a few, and this way got

01:35.180 --> 01:42.960
into correspondence with the Futurians, including Bull and Wallheim and Thoreau Kornworth,

01:44.220 --> 01:46.940
a bunch of others, Robert Dudley Lownd.

01:48.500 --> 01:53.300
I was trying to write some stories, and I sent a couple to Lownd who was then acting

01:53.300 --> 01:54.920
as a sort of half-assed literary agent.

01:57.040 --> 02:04.380
And all these things added up together until Ronald A. Wallheim got an offer from a publisher

02:04.380 --> 02:06.160
who edited a new science fiction magazine.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.120
He had no budget, whatever, for stories.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.580
And he knew about me from Lownd.

02:10.820 --> 02:15.380
Lownd wrote to me saying, will you donate this story to the first issue of Super Science

02:15.380 --> 02:15.880
Stories?

02:17.580 --> 02:20.060
And of course, I said yes, I would have paid for the privilege.

02:21.500 --> 02:27.800
And as a consequence of that, the Futurians invited me to come and be a Futurian and live

02:27.800 --> 02:30.120
one of their communal dwellings in New York when I was 18.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.700
Terribly unlikely things, just a series of them, even as far as I've gone.

02:36.980 --> 02:41.280
And I lived there a couple of years doing a little illustration for magazines and trying

02:41.280 --> 02:41.700
to write.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.940
And that's not the teaching very much.

02:45.620 --> 02:53.840
And then in 1943, again, this Fred Pohl got me a job at popular publications where he

02:53.840 --> 02:54.220
was working.

02:54.460 --> 02:58.440
I needed an assistant editor, and he knew I would work cheap.

02:58.780 --> 03:03.820
So he got me an interview, and I got the job, spent about a year there, and I'm perfectly

03:03.820 --> 03:08.200
convinced now, looking back, that it was that training at popular publications that enabled

03:08.200 --> 03:09.960
me to write fiction professionally.

03:11.100 --> 03:14.380
And the training that you couldn't get in any school in, I'd rather you could get it

03:14.380 --> 03:19.860
now, but it was kind of soaked in because I was reading the flush pile, the unsolicited

03:19.860 --> 03:24.920
names, and it became personally obvious after a while what the difference was between the

03:24.920 --> 03:26.960
stuff we were rejecting and the stuff we were printing.

03:28.220 --> 03:32.960
So when I quit that job, I started writing and went on from there.

03:33.540 --> 03:36.620
I did another stint later at popular, 1949.

03:37.420 --> 03:41.420
And I also worked for a while at the Scott Narrative Literary Agency, which was a reading

03:41.420 --> 03:45.740
agency, where we would get these awful manuscripts and have to criticize them.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.660
I think that helped me a good deal, too.

03:48.680 --> 03:52.920
If I could recommend the writing course, the training course for young writers, I would

03:52.920 --> 03:57.500
certainly say it's too bad that those told magazines don't exist anymore.

03:57.640 --> 04:03.140
If you could possibly get an editorial job or anything of that kind, even a terrible job

04:03.140 --> 04:05.120
in the reading scene literature agency, grab it.

04:08.300 --> 04:08.740
Okay.

04:09.080 --> 04:13.500
We talked to Frederick Paul some time ago, and he told us a little about the Futurians,

04:13.540 --> 04:15.460
and of course you've written a book on that, too.

04:15.940 --> 04:21.480
Could you be a little more specific, sort of briefly, what your relationship with the Futurians was,

04:21.620 --> 04:22.660
what exactly they did?

04:24.060 --> 04:31.660
Well, the Futurians were a very informal organization of science fiction fans who were trying to

04:31.660 --> 04:37.080
become professionals, and in some cases had had had little bits of success here and there,

04:37.120 --> 04:37.900
and published stories.

04:39.460 --> 04:44.840
I told you that Wallheim was editing a magazine before him, Paul, had become an editor, and

04:44.840 --> 04:46.960
after him, Lowndes also became an editor.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.420
They were writing and publishing a little bit, not much.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.200
And to save money because they were all very poor.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.900
They lived in a counting old apartment.

05:01.860 --> 05:07.620
At that time in New York in the late 30s and early 40s, there were lots of apartments that were very cheap.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.020
I forget now.

05:10.100 --> 05:15.400
I think the rental might have been about $30 bucks for a four bedroom railroad flat.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.240
If you had four people living there, it was quite cheap.

05:19.660 --> 05:24.540
And we divided up the household duties around to the cooking and I did the fish washing, which I hated.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.420
We were dirt poor.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.000
We really didn't have any money at all.

05:30.800 --> 05:38.580
We rolled our own cigarettes and we bought the cheapest wine we could find, which was something like 85 cents a gallon.

05:41.960 --> 05:48.600
Our major entertainment was walking down from the 102nd Street or 103rd, it was down to Times Square,

05:49.300 --> 05:53.840
and looking at the bright lights and having a cup of coffee in the cafeteria and then walking home.

05:56.740 --> 06:01.460
I read once where your first professional sale was a cartoon. Is that right?

06:03.240 --> 06:05.100
I suppose that's right. I hadn't thought about that.

06:05.100 --> 06:11.320
It was a cartoon and I sent it to Amazing Stories, which was before I went to New York, before I told a story.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.200
I must have been 17.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.740
I think it was some other ones I didn't like.

06:19.440 --> 06:19.800
Okay.

06:23.560 --> 06:28.780
If I'm correct here, your earliest work in the fanzines was of a critical nature.

06:28.780 --> 06:36.140
I wonder if that's true. Why you started out with that? Did you just have a critical bent or did you not want to write creatively at first?

06:37.040 --> 06:41.280
I was trying to write fiction at that time and not succeeding. It didn't finish the story.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.620
I didn't have any idea how you got to the end of the story.

06:45.900 --> 06:51.680
But I was extremely critical and starting like any other 17 or 18 year old fan.

06:54.620 --> 06:58.480
The first stuff I did for fanzines was not critical in the usual sense.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.260
I wasn't book reviewed or that kind of thing.

07:01.460 --> 07:09.140
That's just a parody once we found some of the things that I thought were really outstandingly dumb in the magazine.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.640
Funny enough, it was a parody.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.760
I did a lot of that.

07:15.180 --> 07:20.060
But when I say a lot, I lie because I only published two issues with my fanzines.

07:20.060 --> 07:22.900
I did very little for other magazines.

07:24.380 --> 07:25.560
It was much later.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.380
Sorry, about 1945 I think.

07:30.520 --> 07:35.400
I did a long critical essay about that and wrote for one of Larry Shaw's amateur magazines.

07:36.220 --> 07:40.900
That was really the first critical work in the usual sense that I did.

07:44.700 --> 07:50.660
From what I've read of your collected essays and so forth, the things that you've done in terms of criticism,

07:51.460 --> 07:58.980
I would say that probably your major concern overall has been to deal with the question of science fiction

07:58.980 --> 08:08.660
to raise its literary standards perhaps, to make it something more than just a second class kind of literature.

08:08.660 --> 08:16.740
I wondered if you thought that science fiction could ever compete with mainstream and characterization, human relations and so forth,

08:16.820 --> 08:18.080
or is it too limited to do that?

08:18.680 --> 08:19.900
Well, that was my position then.

08:20.020 --> 08:25.320
I didn't see any reason why science fiction shouldn't be as good as any other kind of fiction can be.

08:26.060 --> 08:28.180
I don't think now that it ever has been.

08:31.060 --> 08:34.960
And I have a few doubts now about whether it can be.

08:36.100 --> 08:41.660
But at that time, as you say, my effort was to try to raise the standards, improve the breed,

08:42.400 --> 08:44.440
mainly by shooting cripples.

08:48.820 --> 08:54.720
You maybe have some doubts now whether science fiction could ever produce somebody like, say, a Dostoevsky then.

08:56.460 --> 08:56.980
Yeah.

08:56.980 --> 09:04.020
Of course mainstream hasn't produced another Dostoevsky either, so these comparisons are really not much help.

09:04.900 --> 09:16.520
But in the 50s, there was a really strong invigorating movement to upgrade science fiction in certain ways by lifting it out of the pulp formulas.

09:18.300 --> 09:22.620
H. L. Gold was responsible for part of that and Tony Boucher for other part.

09:22.620 --> 09:31.020
It really seemed to me that we were on a plateau which could quite well be succeeded by another plateau and so on upwards.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.100
And I think that was what I was pushing for.

09:35.060 --> 09:36.420
I haven't seen it happen.

09:37.220 --> 09:41.400
We have some very good work being done, very literary work,

09:42.060 --> 09:50.100
but it doesn't seem to me that the field is a hole as advanced as much as I expected it would beyond the 1950s.

09:52.040 --> 09:55.140
Would you see any big changes in the field since you began?

09:56.040 --> 09:56.900
Oh, muchos.

09:57.780 --> 10:05.200
I started reading in 1933 and picked up all the back issues I could find in secondhand bookstores in Portland.

10:08.600 --> 10:15.840
The situation in the 30s was a little fragmented.

10:15.840 --> 10:21.860
By that time, Gernsback had lost his magazines and he didn't have Gernsback in SF anymore.

10:22.060 --> 10:25.840
His idea was to teach science through science fiction.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.460
He didn't always do it, but that was his ideal.

10:29.840 --> 10:34.820
And then you had his successor, an amazing story, T. O'Connor Sloan, who was then in his 80s.

10:35.700 --> 10:43.460
I never met him, but he was described as a marvelous, white-bearded old gentleman who considered science fiction a sort of a hobby.

10:44.280 --> 10:54.220
He liked to use archaeology, and he really did not have any of the technocratic pervers that Gernsback had.

10:54.540 --> 10:58.700
In fact, he said in print more than once that he didn't believe that the space travel would ever happen.

11:00.600 --> 11:11.340
And then you had a founding story, which in the early 30s was strictly a rather low-grade adventure magazine.

11:13.240 --> 11:20.880
Their contribution to the field was to import the stereotypes of adventure fiction, which worked very well.

11:21.040 --> 11:25.260
And we still see that thread running through science fiction right up to the present time.

11:27.640 --> 11:32.900
And then in the late 30s, 37, 38, John Campbell took over as Tannily.

11:34.480 --> 11:40.500
And the moralists transformed it. He raised the level in a certain direction.

11:41.560 --> 11:47.720
He wanted scientific accuracy, or at least a semblance of it, a lack of scientific ignorance.

11:49.360 --> 12:02.260
He wanted plausible stories about the future, not the usual triad of a brave hero and his gutters and butties and the fainting heroine and the mad scientist.

12:04.160 --> 12:14.940
So in that sense, and also because he got it stable, and very good writers in the early 40s, that raised the level considerably, markedly.

12:16.080 --> 12:21.400
And then, as I say, gold, voucher, and others came along in the 50s, and there was another quantum leap.

12:23.420 --> 12:26.020
And it seemed to me that that was the natural course of events.

12:26.020 --> 12:36.680
And what we wanted was another quantum leap, and so on, until there would be no distinguishable difference in terms of quality between science fiction and mainstream.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.540
And as I say, I don't think that that happened.

12:41.540 --> 12:47.460
Some of those quantum leaps in the past, which you've mentioned, have been due, I think, to, as you said, to some of the more influential editors.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.540
Do we have editors today who still have that kind of influence?

12:52.060 --> 12:56.260
Well, I think we certainly have influential editors, but I don't think they're trying to do that.

12:56.480 --> 13:02.940
I think they're trying to produce what they conceive the reading public wants in the very successful editors.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.440
George Souther, for example, was a very sharp editor.

13:08.380 --> 13:11.440
And Stanley Spitt, I think, was doing an excellent job with analog.

13:12.060 --> 13:19.300
And the first ed firm that was employing along with fantasy and science fiction for many years, focuses on a lot of really neat stuff.

13:21.200 --> 13:33.100
Fantasy and science fiction has always had a more literary cast, not only in the magazines, partly because it's about half and half fantasy and science fiction, as the name would suggest.

13:33.960 --> 13:39.540
And for some reason, the literary quality of fantasy writing has tended to be higher than that of science fiction.

13:42.980 --> 13:50.880
Okay, listen, when you began your orbit anthologies in 1966, what kind of hopes did you have for them? What was your idea behind them?

13:52.320 --> 13:57.520
Well, in the first place, I just thought there was a marketing strategy, though, that hadn't been explored.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.460
Please forgive my cross.

14:04.680 --> 14:19.020
Well, it seemed to me that with hardcover publication, if you could get book club and paperback, you'd have a basis on which you could say very good rates and get a broad audience.

14:20.340 --> 14:27.260
And that because it was hardcovered, originally, you wouldn't have to worry about some of the pulp cliches and the juvenile readers.

14:28.640 --> 14:35.180
And that didn't work either. Orbit never did achieve the sales that I hope for or publishes hope for.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.920
It's got a few book club sales, but not many. It wasn't every issue. It should have been.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.920
And the paperback never did sell very well.

14:50.060 --> 14:55.760
After I went to hardcover with the series, they couldn't get paperback at all, and that was what made them cancel it after a while.

14:55.860 --> 15:01.420
They hung on quite a long time. They were very decent about it. But eventually they thought it just wasn't going to happen.

15:04.600 --> 15:09.400
Well, was that the first anthology of original science fiction that was published?

15:09.400 --> 15:17.660
No, it was not. Fred Poole was in a series called Star. Let me think. That must have been in the late 50s, I forget.

15:18.600 --> 15:27.160
And before him, there had been a couple of one-shot original anthologies. I forgot who the editors were. Let me think.

15:28.660 --> 15:37.180
I used to... I think the first one actually goes back quite a way. It was something rather inconspicuous and nobody paid much attention.

15:37.720 --> 15:41.800
But Fred was the first series of anthologies of original science fiction stories.

15:44.040 --> 15:49.220
In terms of the, I guess, the literary level of the Orbit series, you must be proud of that.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.400
Some of those years, I think the majority of the Nebula Award stories came from Orbit, didn't they?

15:54.140 --> 15:57.200
For a couple of years it was storing heavily in the Nebula's, yeah.

15:58.180 --> 16:04.820
But I don't really know whether that has anything to do with the quality of the stories or just because I was conspicuous at the time. I was the president of SFWA.

16:08.560 --> 16:17.320
Yeah, that leads me on to the next area I want to talk about. You had a large part in the founding of that. Could you explain that you're part in that and why you were interested in starting it?

16:19.120 --> 16:21.500
Well, about 10 years earlier it must have been.

16:24.120 --> 16:29.060
There was an effort to form a guild of science fiction writers and they went to one or two of their meetings.

16:30.020 --> 16:36.020
And it was pitiful because they used the program and procedure and they had 50 people all arguing.

16:36.880 --> 16:45.660
And they finally hammered out a sort of set of bylaws and elected officers and then nothing happened. Officers all went home and died.

16:46.860 --> 16:55.120
And I realized at that time that there was a very easy way to do it. You didn't have to have the big meetings and you didn't have to have all that operated.

16:55.120 --> 17:01.880
One person could do it, but I didn't think I was conspicuous about it at that time. I didn't think anybody knew who I was.

17:03.540 --> 17:12.180
Later on I was becoming more visible and I realized that I probably could do it.

17:14.100 --> 17:25.820
The precipitating event was by receiving in the same week three requests for an apology reprint for flat fees, which I thought was unfair to the audience.

17:26.580 --> 17:36.260
So I wrote a flyer, it's a one-page thing, advising authors not to sign agreements for flat fee anthology reprints and saying,

17:36.260 --> 17:41.080
I'd like more information of this kind, send in your three bucks and become a charter member of SFWA.

17:42.400 --> 17:53.140
I got a plock of responses and when I had about 78 I declared them the charter members and wrote a set of bylaws and sent that around and we were more or less in business.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.720
Okay, and what did you serve? One or two years as president at the first?

17:58.800 --> 17:59.440
I did two terms.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.800
Okay, and you'd have to look back. Wouldn't you have to judge it today as a successful organization?

18:06.140 --> 18:11.520
I think so. I think it's done more for members than any other writers organization that I know of.

18:12.360 --> 18:23.560
We got about 9,000 bucks in back royalties for Tolkien and a lot of things, or isn't that awful if your name just popped out of my head.

18:28.580 --> 18:38.420
And we've settled a lot of grievances. The latest one was a really terrible new contract which Davis Publications began to use.

18:39.380 --> 18:50.180
Just an awful contract, god we got both. Every right can be conceivably attached to a story and we make such a sense that they withdrew it.

18:52.520 --> 18:52.920
Okay.

18:54.600 --> 19:05.180
About a year ago we talked to Norman Spinrad, I guess who's the current president, and he said he was interested in working on internationalizing and hooking up with some of the European organizations. Do you think that's a good idea?

19:06.280 --> 19:23.800
There's a lot of feeling among the members that we ought to be more international than we are. I always resisted that because it didn't seem to me that we could work effectively for writers living abroad, or not publishing in this country. I guess it's harmless. I don't see if it could do us any damage.

19:27.080 --> 19:41.000
Okay, let me move on to one more area before I get down to just a few questions on your own work. I guess you realize I'll probably have to ask something about the Milford Science Fiction Writers Conference. Could you also give me a brief statement on the genesis of that?

19:42.320 --> 19:53.640
Well this was in the mid-50s, and for some reason Judy Merrill and I got talking about the idea of having a Writers Conference in Milford, Pennsylvania, which is a very small town in the Poconos.

19:55.660 --> 20:11.760
It was sort of the way you might talk about building a building with basement. Nothing was done about this until Judy and I went to the World Con in Detroit at the kid was, and discovered that we were much more better at it than we realized.

20:14.340 --> 20:25.700
Well that energized us, and we thought that possibly if we invited people to the Alfred Bay, they could actually come. And we sent out an invitation. We got Jim Wisch to join the Masthead.

20:26.800 --> 20:38.940
We had a lot of people come, and we had more respectability. And this was the year in which the World Con was in New York, so it was easier for people to get out there directly afterwards.

20:38.940 --> 20:56.120
And we got 40 people. Just amazing. It was quite intense. We had evening discussions that went on for several hours. People raising the boards of hands to do the next to speak. Quite exciting.

20:57.180 --> 21:13.080
So we decided to do it annually. After the first one, we didn't have a World Con near us to provide a lot of people. The attendance dropped to, I want to know, 15 or so.

21:15.080 --> 21:21.040
When it gradually came up again, we began to get a bunch of regulars who came every year, and there would be a few more and so on.

21:22.440 --> 21:33.400
So in the later years, we got up to about 25 or 30, which was really as much as we could handle in the workshops, which by then had become a regular feature of no free.

21:34.760 --> 21:45.600
Where everybody would submit a manuscript or two. And then every morning we'd all sit around having read these manuscripts and discuss them in turn around the circuit.

21:48.720 --> 21:58.620
This is probably an obvious question, but I want to ask it anyhow to see your response. Do you think writers are, what kind of benefit would writers get from that? Have they been benefited?

22:00.120 --> 22:08.420
Well, this is a question that Katie and I ask ourselves every year because we teach at Clarean, which is an outgrowth of military.

22:10.040 --> 22:17.880
And you can certainly point to what's the distinguished ex-military diets and very nice visited distinguished diets.

22:18.680 --> 22:24.780
But whether that proves anything or not is another question. You have to have a controlled group, which we have never had.

22:27.460 --> 22:38.140
I can testify that if you could help me in a specific way with workshop helps, people point out what it was and your stories that you absolutely haven't seen, sometimes crucially.

22:40.640 --> 22:53.080
And again, just for my own experience, it seems to me that learning to criticize other people's stories technically enables you eventually to criticize your own, which is more critical than your own.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.700
It becomes a little bit easier to see the flaws in your own way.

23:00.060 --> 23:04.000
Okay, you're not associated with the Milford Conference anymore then?

23:04.000 --> 23:11.400
No, we had to stop doing it five or six years ago. Don't hold me to the number because I'm very weak on dates.

23:13.320 --> 23:18.660
It turned out that year that we had signed up for so many things in the summer that we were going to have to drop something.

23:19.300 --> 23:23.480
And it couldn't be Clarean. We were committed to that. So we had to stop doing Milford.

23:24.500 --> 23:30.320
And it wasn't really a painful loss to us by that time because our old gang was dispersed.

23:32.640 --> 23:36.500
We had moved away from Milford, first to Florida, then to Oregon.

23:37.960 --> 23:46.180
And it just wasn't the same thing anymore. It was turning into more of a sort of mini-Clarean where you had the chiefs from the Indians.

23:46.880 --> 23:52.120
Kaby and I were the chiefs from the rest of the Indians, which had not been the case at all at Milford.

23:52.220 --> 23:57.540
That was by design and practice. A group of peers.

23:59.560 --> 24:06.880
So what Milford, as it just turned out, had become sort of a duplication for us of what we were doing at Clarean.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.860
But Ed Bryant has done it a couple of times, not every year.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.860
And Denver or...

24:17.800 --> 24:24.660
But the difference between the two, like you said, that Clarean would be more for actual beginners, where you would be the teacher rather than peers.

24:27.640 --> 24:32.320
Okay, let me just move on while we have some time to your own work because I have some questions on that.

24:33.380 --> 24:41.500
I'm not sure what your intended titles were, but the two novels, A for Anything and Analog Men, they're also known as the People Maker and Hell's Pavement.

24:41.860 --> 24:42.980
What are the titles you prefer?

24:44.740 --> 24:52.180
Analog Men and Hell's Pavement were my titles. They were retitled by paperback editors. They used to do that a lot. They don't do it so much anymore.

24:57.560 --> 24:58.280
Okay, the...

25:00.200 --> 25:02.440
A for Anything was called the People Maker, though, wasn't it?

25:02.700 --> 25:09.040
No, it was for A for Anything. The first book publication was the paperback, which was retitled by the paperback editors.

25:09.700 --> 25:15.920
But I published a portion of it in magazines, and one of them was at the title that I prefer in A for Anything.

25:20.380 --> 25:21.900
I hate the title, the People Maker.

25:24.480 --> 25:30.160
Okay, in that book, the A for Anything, I'm sure you've gotten questions on this. In fact, I know you have.

25:30.160 --> 25:48.500
But the totally unexpected ending that comes up, at least I as a reader expected the protagonist, I forget his name right now, to become sort of a good guy, to overcome his training and to let the old slave live and to marry the woman and so forth.

25:48.860 --> 25:54.340
Why did you choose to have him revert to his stratified slave-oriented society?

25:56.680 --> 26:06.120
Well, what you're talking about, the ending that you expected is the cliche ending, romantic and sentimental. I wanted to do a realistic ending.

26:07.180 --> 26:13.460
I thought that the happy ending to that, you know, conventional quote, happy ending to that novel would have been false.

26:14.980 --> 26:21.460
And this was one of the things that interested me in writing the novel in the first place, or anything I've done except for the plastic.

26:22.380 --> 26:33.860
I was trying to do science fiction realistically. I thought that was part of the new way that was to call that thing, the way of realism that came in the 50s.

26:34.940 --> 26:39.120
And I was awfully acquired, still am, of the romantic clichés of science fiction.

26:42.580 --> 26:56.220
Okay, the device that you put into that novel, the gizmo, the transform society, it's kind of ironic that a device like that which can give people whatever they want would lead to a slave master society.

26:56.740 --> 27:00.620
Do you think that's the way it would work or would it be being deliberately pessimistic?

27:01.700 --> 27:17.660
Well, I thought it was logical. I was counter punching in that novel against some other treatments of the same device, the same gadget that had been published before, which I thought were compouts.

27:18.440 --> 27:30.620
For instance, George York's Metro of One, in which the matter that the duplicator was invented, and of course chaos ensued, and he rescued the world by inventing a kind of currency that couldn't be duplicated.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.600
And that was one too many rabbits out of the hat, I thought.

27:35.980 --> 27:44.860
So, again, I just wanted to do it realistically. It seems to me that if I had made a good case that in fact slavery would be the result.

27:45.440 --> 27:57.960
I admit that it was an imaginative projection. I don't necessarily defend the idea that that's what would happen with practice.

27:59.260 --> 28:08.900
And another writer, several years later, I'll think of his name if I possibly can, wrote a story in response to that one, which really delighted me.

28:09.040 --> 28:24.820
I like this dialogue, I think, which in which he showed that a good marketer, a good business man could get along perfectly well and make money, even if there was a matter to duplicate. Marvelous stories.

28:29.120 --> 28:37.040
When A for Anything and Analog Min, when those were published in the 50s, there wasn't much critical science fiction.

28:37.220 --> 28:44.480
Things like the space merchants, your books remind me of, were you criticizing a consumer-oriented society? There wasn't much of that those days, was there?

28:45.500 --> 29:05.640
No, I think Krett Voles and Jero Kermblitz, the space merchant's gravy plan, as it was called, was a source of the magazine, was stunning rejection of the kind of dramatic cliché that has been prominent in science fiction up to a lot of time.

29:05.640 --> 29:21.400
There had been social satire in science fiction for a long time before during science fiction, and the magazine published some of it, but it was pretty remote. It didn't have the cutting edge that the gravy plan had.

29:24.680 --> 29:45.320
Maybe just one question on analog min. I think that you're contrasting the scientist, Kusko or Kusko, whatever his name is, who invents, of course, the device which causes the analog and leads to the kind of society they have in laudermilk, the more humanitarian type.

29:45.320 --> 29:51.360
But in the wrong ways, they're both very narrow, and are you saying that they're both using the wrong methods?

29:52.980 --> 29:55.320
I'm not sure why you call laudermilk narrow.

29:57.180 --> 30:01.420
Well, I guess because he would use killing to achieve his aims.

30:02.580 --> 30:11.600
Well, again, I was dragged into that. I liked laudermilk, and I would personally, I would have been personally happy to make him just a nice old man.

30:12.640 --> 30:21.360
But logically, I couldn't see any way to keep that organization alive or to achieve the bane without killing anybody. I didn't like doing that.

30:22.220 --> 30:33.540
And I thought it would give a sort of moral ambiguity to the whole underground, but I would rather do that than paper over the problem.

30:37.120 --> 30:50.880
Okay, I understand. In other words, at the end of that novel, when, gosh, I forget his name, Arthur or something like that, when he becomes part of the underground movement and he ends the novel admiring laudermilk, then the reader is supposed to feel the same way in your estimation.

30:52.940 --> 31:07.780
Well, in fact, I think I also provided a viewpoint character who would have had a little more doubts about what laudermilk was up to. But it couldn't have been Arthur because he wasn't that sophisticated.

31:13.000 --> 31:26.560
Okay, in reference to both of those books and to some of your short stories, particularly some of your better known ones like Country of the Kind or Masks, I see a strain of pessimism in your work.

31:26.620 --> 31:32.840
Is that simply a counter to the romance and the stereotypes you saw in science fiction?

31:33.860 --> 31:49.500
I'm not a pessimistic person in my daily life. I think we're optimistic, but I'm cheerful most of the time. And I have a lot of fun. I don't worry too much about disasters in the future.

31:49.500 --> 32:12.300
I certainly don't enjoy seeing people slip on banana peels, but I like irony and surprising people in history. I just like very much the story that because everything's going to be rosy and because it's a very plausible way and everybody laps it up, I don't know why.

32:15.660 --> 32:27.140
Okay, in Country of the Kind, maybe I'm seeing too much in that, but I caught maybe a little satire on humanitarianism, overdoing humanitarianism, for instance.

32:31.220 --> 32:55.820
No, I don't think that was what I was after. This came out of a remark in Hill's Pavement. Let me think. It actually was in Laudermilk's journal when he talked about a dream he had had of the future they were going to achieve, in which everybody would be psychically healthy.

32:57.140 --> 33:13.640
There probably wouldn't be any art or any humor. And I think I picked that up from something in Robert Graves' novel, Watch the North Wind Rise. His future society was like that. Everyone was terrifically healthy, mentally.

33:13.640 --> 33:38.160
But there were no jokes. Nobody laughed at jokes. And I think the art, that part didn't come into grace, but I just began to wonder, would there be any artistic creation in the world in which everybody was completely healthy, mentally?

33:40.520 --> 33:54.340
Again, this was a proposition that seemed to me to be interesting to us. I wouldn't defend it necessarily. I think there's something to it, though. I think there's...the art comes out of some kind of a pinch to get in your childhood.

33:56.140 --> 34:03.740
And that if you really had a healthy society, there simply wouldn't be anything to make good art out of it.

34:05.300 --> 34:19.720
Just recently, I crossed a reference to a painting of Picasso which I'd never heard of before. It's called War and Peace. It's in two parts. On the left side you see war and there are all kinds of fascinating demons running around.

34:19.720 --> 34:36.420
On the right side, all I could think of was peace with a bunch of old men playing handpipes. Which is quite well. And it just seemed to me that a completely healthy and peaceful world would be rather what it is.

34:36.420 --> 34:36.540
I don't know.

34:43.120 --> 34:53.420
Okay. I imagine one of your better known stories is that humorous one, To Serve Man. I wondered if there was an impetus behind that one.

34:55.340 --> 34:56.500
You wondered if there was a witch.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.980
An impetus or a particular idea from which it originated.

34:59.980 --> 35:17.160
Well, that came out of her remark by my second wife when she was pregnant with our first child. She was looking forward to the delivery and she imagined the doctor holding up the kid and laughing out of the buttocks and herself saying, give him one for me.

35:18.060 --> 35:22.740
And that became the last line of the story. No, not the last line, but pretty close to it.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.400
Yeah, I remember now I read that.

35:29.780 --> 35:46.840
Story ideas can come out of anywhere. Something somebody says, just a word or phrase or something you see in the grocery store. Sometimes folk tribulations, you can't imagine where the story tells the story, but it sort of accretes itself around almost any sharp object.

35:49.480 --> 36:02.100
One of your later books, I think the stories go back a ways, but one of the later published books that you've had the world in Thorin, to me was of course very different than most of your other work. And I wondered why you decided to try your hand at fantasy.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.040
What makes you call it fantasy? I'm curious because a lot of people have bought that.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.060
Well, I don't know what else to call it.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.020
Why wouldn't you call it fantasy?

36:14.380 --> 36:26.580
Well, okay, one of my questions was going to be you provide some background there. For instance, the I get the idea if it's the earth that it had been overheated and some scientists have had to move it.

36:27.140 --> 36:31.380
And perhaps creatures went underground and formed these societies and caverns.

36:31.920 --> 36:36.120
I guess if that background were extrapolated or extended, it could be seen as science fiction.

36:37.740 --> 36:47.800
I guess I didn't make that plain enough. I thought I had in the little introductory section of the chapter, I thought I had laid out more or less what happened.

36:49.500 --> 37:00.600
For some of us about to go over, people made a spaceship out of the earth and propelled it out of the solar system.

37:02.680 --> 37:08.060
It also went underground to accommodate the increasing population.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.760
But the planet under the control of a central computer.

37:13.540 --> 37:16.320
And then there was a war which destroyed civilization.

37:18.180 --> 37:27.560
The complete control was turned over to computers that were directed to do whatever was necessary for the welfare of human beings.

37:28.560 --> 37:42.940
And since the computers had not been told what welfare meant to human beings, it had to try to figure out what was the best society.

37:43.940 --> 37:54.300
And therefore, having sealed up these caverns in order to prevent another war, it promoted the growth of different kinds of cultures, each one in each little cavern.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.960
Hoping to find out eventually what the best one was.

37:58.640 --> 37:59.380
Hopeful path.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.540
But that was the world which the model takes place.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.880
I really thought I had indicated that sufficiently, but perhaps not.

38:08.600 --> 38:23.600
Well, you did near the end of the book, but I think maybe what threw me off in particular was the beginning of it where you sort of present a Scandinavian type society at the beginning which immediately connoted to me a middle ages and the medievalism and that kind of fantasy.

38:23.600 --> 38:30.020
Yes, I know, but there have been lots of science fiction stories, I think too many in fact written about future worlds and that you've learned back to feudalism.

38:33.600 --> 38:43.720
Okay, a little earlier you mentioned that when you were, I think you made a statement about fantasy, did you say that fantasy could be deeper than science fiction?

38:44.440 --> 38:45.840
No, I didn't mean to say that.

38:46.540 --> 38:49.100
I'll be talking about that term in fantasy and science fiction.

38:49.240 --> 39:00.240
I think the quality of that magazine, although variable, has been sort of the quality of the writing has been a little higher than most science fiction magazines because of the presence of the fantasy writers in it.

39:01.060 --> 39:07.820
There's a long tradition of literacy, good writing in fantasy which we haven't had in science fiction.

39:11.460 --> 39:16.020
Do you have a useful distinction between, that could distinguish science fiction and fantasy for me?

39:16.400 --> 39:16.640
Sure.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.940
Science fiction is a branch of fantasy, that's all it is.

39:23.140 --> 39:36.440
That branch which appeals, which, let me start over, which helps to create a suspension of disbelief in the reader by appealing to the authority of science.

39:36.440 --> 39:48.900
That doesn't mean there's necessarily any science in the stories that are usually it, but it shows up this cloud of authority by referring to that and then you can relax and say, well, this is the fantasy that's actually happening.

39:52.460 --> 39:55.160
Okay, I have about just two or three more questions, can you handle that?

39:55.480 --> 39:55.740
Sure.

39:56.060 --> 39:56.300
Okay.

39:59.440 --> 40:03.680
What's your reaction to critics' response to your own work?

40:06.220 --> 40:08.620
Well, really, I haven't had a whole lot of trouble with critics.

40:09.800 --> 40:15.520
When I do get an unfavorable review, I consider the source, I mean, say, well, that turkey, do you understand the book, or anything, whatever.

40:16.260 --> 40:23.140
I very seldom had to reply to a critic. I think it's a mug game, do so, unless you can nail them to the wall with some factual errors.

40:27.740 --> 40:28.100
Okay.

40:30.700 --> 40:36.080
I got a hold of that volume, and I think it was Barry Malzberg put it together, the best of Damon and I, I think it was.

40:36.960 --> 40:44.680
Near the end of that book was your story down there, in which you remarked that hardly anybody had seen the purpose of that one.

40:45.540 --> 40:46.500
So I worked on it.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.360
Tell me what you thought.

40:49.780 --> 40:50.140
Okay.

40:53.140 --> 40:59.060
A society which is too sterile, which has removed itself from its roots.

41:00.280 --> 41:07.800
This man can write stories with actually the computer writes the stories. He just chooses certain things, buttons to push.

41:08.480 --> 41:18.200
But he finds that he needs something which is more of a low life, nitty gritty, real life nature, and he seeks it out in a sort of a clandestine way.

41:19.780 --> 41:32.580
That's right. And I think the only part that people didn't get, because I really didn't want to say it, was that sometime in the recent past there's been a race war, and the black skinned people of this country have been wiped out.

41:33.380 --> 41:35.720
And everybody else was carrying a terrific load of guilt.

41:37.580 --> 41:39.380
There were no more Negroes in Maryland.

41:40.180 --> 41:45.080
Instead, we reported Appalachian peoples to the place.

41:45.260 --> 41:50.840
If you look at the dialogue in the way they refer to it, you see that they are Appalachian peoples.

41:51.600 --> 41:59.360
The little boys tucking into a platter of frozen greens and so on. They're white, but they're exotic.

42:00.740 --> 42:08.640
And he's attracted to it, prostituted, which is in the last scene, because he's so dark that he might almost be midway.

42:11.440 --> 42:17.620
Okay, good. Could you tell me what kind of future work plans you have for your own fiction?

42:18.740 --> 42:21.640
I'm bearing down on the last couple of chapters of a novel.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.800
She's in the contract at Berkeley. It's called The Man in the Tree.

42:28.460 --> 42:34.600
I should have told you that the last one, The World of Thuring, is a book that I was hung up on for 15 years,

42:35.940 --> 42:43.920
and I was locked on it intermittently for all that time. I'd write a chapter and then I'd come to another stone wall, and I'd hit it back off.

42:45.080 --> 42:48.440
Finally got to the finish, and that book was locked.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.700
Now I can write it.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.540
A novel of speed, but it's not the way it is.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.720
The book I think was that I set myself as an impossible cat.

42:59.060 --> 43:06.380
As you know, that novel is divided into episodes almost every one of which takes place in a new culture.

43:06.740 --> 43:12.480
I can do a bunch of cultures, and it's history, customs, and all that stuff, and it's just absurdly difficult.

43:16.020 --> 43:19.540
One of the episodes in that published separately is not either short stories.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.440
That's why Fred Paul ran, I think, the Trees in Galaxy.

43:24.620 --> 43:29.380
We have to go pretty far back in the files to find them because it took me 15 years to finish it.

43:33.440 --> 43:39.280
Okay, listen, Mr. Nye, I could keep on asking questions for a long time, but I think this is probably enough. We've taken enough of your time.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.560
Listen, what we do is now we will edit these into shows.

43:44.680 --> 43:49.980
Our program is aired every day for five minutes, so we'll probably get five or six shows out of this.

43:50.340 --> 43:55.640
We're probably talking about maybe six weeks to two months into the future, so when they're edited and done, we'll send you copies.

43:56.580 --> 44:02.880
Okay, and listen, one more question. Do you think if we wrote in a few months, your wife might consent to an interview also?

44:03.180 --> 44:04.540
Sure, she'd love to.

44:04.900 --> 44:07.800
Okay, we might do that then, and listen, we appreciate your time very much.

44:07.800 --> 44:08.860
Well, it's been a pleasure.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.280
And keep up to work, okay?

44:10.500 --> 44:10.800
Okay.

44:11.080 --> 44:11.540
Okay, goodbye.
