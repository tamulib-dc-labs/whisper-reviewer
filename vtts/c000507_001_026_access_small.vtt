00:00.980 --> 00:07.440
This next tape is an interview with Charlie Brown, the founder, editor, and publisher

00:07.440 --> 00:09.680
of Locust Magazine.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.360
It took place in the early 1980s.

00:17.320 --> 00:21.300
Okay, the tapes are on. Very informal. I'll let you step.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.220
I want to explore first of all how Locust got started.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.860
So how did you start it and how has it grown and evolved?

00:31.280 --> 00:35.040
Well, I started Locust in 1968.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.160
It started...

00:39.160 --> 00:42.820
One of the main reasons I started was I wanted to be able to learn how to write.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.120
I was a full-time fan. I could never seem to write anybody a letter.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.560
So I decided if I had myself a deadline at that time, it was over two weeks,

00:52.500 --> 00:56.440
I would get some experiences writing, I'll be able to write letters and things like that.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.940
Well, it's 15 years later, I could count right letters.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.180
I'll just put out some magazines.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.460
This mainly evolved from being about fandom.

01:09.620 --> 01:14.640
It was done every other weekend. It was written on Friday.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.800
It's been sent to us on Saturday.

01:18.420 --> 01:20.600
It's been run off and mailed on Sunday.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.220
It was released every other weekend with a gang of people in the house

01:27.160 --> 01:29.380
helping out, things like that. It just kept growing.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.780
The one thing about a magazine is if you keep putting out issues,

01:34.780 --> 01:35.880
you get more and more news.

01:37.100 --> 01:41.560
And gradually it changed over towards more towards the professional side.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.800
Mainly because that's where my interests were.

01:45.900 --> 01:49.420
They were the people who responded more often than I thought.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.980
I'm actually at a crucial point where I couldn't print it anymore.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.700
We went to professional printing and it's been growing ever since.

01:59.120 --> 02:03.640
It's brought the laser short novel now, started out as a young age.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.580
So that's how it grew.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.940
Did you ever in your wildest dreams imagine that it would get as big

02:12.940 --> 02:16.600
circulation-wise and production-wise as it is?

02:16.880 --> 02:21.620
Well, no. It originally started out to only run for two years.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.220
One of the other things that started out was that this was very

02:27.280 --> 02:29.780
an advertisement for the Boston Group.

02:30.060 --> 02:31.460
We were bidding for well-time.

02:33.220 --> 02:36.000
I just wrote the original and the Boston Group put it out

02:36.000 --> 02:37.420
but that didn't work very well.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.520
And at the end of two years they didn't win the convention.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.160
I think mainly because it was well-pitched.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.460
But then we discovered that we were being nominated for a year ago.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.820
It seemed like it would be interesting to run it right through the Boston Convention

02:51.820 --> 02:52.800
and try and win a year ago.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.900
Which we did and after that we just never stopped.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.740
But I never imagined it would grow that much.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.420
Where did the name come from?

03:05.360 --> 03:11.740
The name came from various points, various things.

03:13.120 --> 03:18.780
The locus is the connecting point in a circle.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.480
We considered ourselves the connecting point to the science fiction,

03:24.520 --> 03:27.860
to the science fiction, to the professional fans and publishers.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.040
And the other thing was just from the old Spanish phrase of LOC,

03:33.140 --> 03:34.080
to letter of comment.

03:35.900 --> 03:40.100
And that's why the letter called the still-called locus to the capital of LOC.

03:43.260 --> 03:44.580
Okay, I didn't know that.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.700
Hey, that's nothing new.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.440
You started out as a fan.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.800
So you were obviously involved in a fan organization.

03:54.620 --> 03:57.060
How did you get interested in science fiction in the first place?

03:58.460 --> 04:03.580
I started reading science, I was reading a sound ring in the 40s.

04:05.680 --> 04:09.580
And I started to sound them all around 1949.

04:12.060 --> 04:18.360
You are finding the conventions listed in one of these magazines,

04:18.700 --> 04:20.780
they were super science stories or something like that.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.320
And they listed the 1950s convention.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.240
I was 12 years old and I went to this convention.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.940
I had a wonderful time and I met all these old men,

04:31.080 --> 04:34.640
like Fred Cole and Buster Del Rey, they were old.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.820
Most of them were pushing 30.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.040
And when you're 12, you don't think anybody's ever going to reach a 30.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.500
And it's really up there.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.640
Now it's frightening because I met two other people

04:48.640 --> 04:51.440
and they're considered the same age group.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.020
But that was how I discovered fandom.

04:57.820 --> 05:01.200
And I put out my first fan scene about 1951.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.880
Dropped out again when I was in college,

05:08.280 --> 05:11.880
things like that, eventually went back to it, at least 50.

05:13.820 --> 05:14.340
Next?

05:16.200 --> 05:18.740
How has fandom changed since those days?

05:19.900 --> 05:21.620
Well, there were women around that time.

05:23.400 --> 05:27.420
1950 was when I was simply 13-year-old kid and I was right there.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.100
I was talking to Harold Ellison today and he said,

05:33.340 --> 05:35.780
the one thing he just came back from Australia,

05:36.100 --> 05:38.000
he's just a minor at the Australian convention,

05:38.880 --> 05:42.440
it's just like this, an American fandom in the 50s.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.820
There were all these simply 16-year-old kids and there were no women.

05:45.660 --> 05:49.580
And they were all very sincere, very bright, and very socially inept.

05:50.940 --> 05:53.340
Which was pretty well-planned and was my success.

05:56.940 --> 06:01.140
You were at Locust Poll, the results likely seem to be showing

06:01.140 --> 06:05.180
that science fiction fans, at least the ones that answer polls, are getting older.

06:06.020 --> 06:10.100
Does this indicate some kind of trend, do you think, in the people that read science fiction?

06:12.340 --> 06:13.520
I don't know.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.240
Our audience is always going to be cutting older.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.760
Man, it is just the audience that stayed with us.

06:19.760 --> 06:25.700
About 80% of the people who read Locust in 1968 still read Locust.

06:26.700 --> 06:30.140
Which of course keeps raising the ages.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.060
There are some new people, but not that many.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.800
One of the changes of course is in the magazine.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.260
The magazine is going on to aim at a teenage fan.

06:45.180 --> 06:46.620
They aim at the professional.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.440
And of course it is immediately attracting older professionals.

06:54.040 --> 07:00.420
I think there are probably no more than two or three professionals who are not going to be able to do that.

07:03.460 --> 07:07.660
This must make you feel a pretty strong sense of responsibility then.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.320
Oh, I don't know what you mean by a sense of responsibility.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.300
You are the leading news magazine.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.840
During your living, what I used to do for nothing, that's about it.

07:21.960 --> 07:26.240
What would you be doing if you weren't making a living on Locust?

07:27.140 --> 07:28.540
Where would you be right now?

07:28.740 --> 07:30.560
I spent 15 years in electrical engineering.

07:33.060 --> 07:34.900
Designing power plants and things like that.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.260
I was a full-time engineer up until about six or seven years ago.

07:45.940 --> 07:53.760
So you finally got the wherewithal that it takes to jump out and just do this for full-time then?

07:53.860 --> 07:55.160
Well, we never have done it full-time.

07:55.320 --> 08:03.960
What happened was there was a strong break in the engineering field on 9-17-5.

08:04.940 --> 08:06.980
I got laid off for the first time in my life.

08:08.440 --> 08:13.520
I figured while I was waiting for the field to pick up again, I would try writing for the year.

08:15.120 --> 08:15.720
But I did.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.820
I wrote mostly nonfiction articles from magazines.

08:20.740 --> 08:25.860
I had to focus on the side and try to fill it up as much as possible.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.660
Eventually I discovered I didn't even have to go back to work.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.700
Every once in a while I get a call for an engineering job.

08:35.860 --> 08:39.660
I feel very good about that, but I have no intention of ever going back to it.

08:41.060 --> 08:44.260
Have you ever had any aspirations or tried to write science fiction?

08:45.300 --> 08:48.760
Not fiction. No. I've never had any interest in writing fiction.

08:49.540 --> 08:54.480
I've written a lot of nonfiction. I've written a lot of text books. That's about it.

08:56.580 --> 09:00.180
Now that you've added focus full-time and it is a science fiction magazine,

09:00.460 --> 09:03.380
do you get to actually read science fiction very much?

09:03.620 --> 09:05.700
Oh, yeah. I've read...

09:05.700 --> 09:09.760
Probably I've read half of the novels that are coming out next fall.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.480
I read a lot of science fiction.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.540
I read a lot more mysteries, but I read a lot of science fiction too.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.800
There seem to be other magazines that are springing up,

09:24.820 --> 09:28.220
which I guess are competitors although I don't really see them competing.

09:28.680 --> 09:33.860
But do you think this is good for the field pretty much to have more than one point of view?

09:34.260 --> 09:36.320
Yeah, it doesn't really bother me at all.

09:37.800 --> 09:38.900
In fact, it's helped.

09:40.080 --> 09:44.260
I assume you're talking about science fiction chronicle and these photos.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.740
Since he started, my speculation has gone way up.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.220
He's interested in more people in the field.

09:54.980 --> 09:55.440
Okay.

09:56.800 --> 10:01.100
I assume that you still get a kick out of producing locusts.

10:01.120 --> 10:05.400
There's something that just makes you want to keep doing it besides that it makes your living right now.

10:05.780 --> 10:06.200
Oh, sure.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.120
I was looking at the Blue Lines, the new issue today.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.420
It's very exciting.

10:11.620 --> 10:15.740
The first time you see it come together, see all the photographs together,

10:16.120 --> 10:20.920
and all the stories in one place instead of in pieces.

10:23.900 --> 10:27.500
And you still get a real thrill when you pull that first copy.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.520
I'll get my final copy tomorrow.

10:32.780 --> 10:36.780
I'll be down at the printer 8.30 in the morning watching the team run off.

10:36.780 --> 10:42.260
I'll pull out a copy myself, tape it together, and then I'll have another copy.

10:45.760 --> 10:53.760
In your editorial, you generally acknowledge the help of people that help mail it or collate it or whatever.

10:54.300 --> 10:58.400
Could you give us kind of a typical day where that takes place?

10:58.540 --> 11:01.560
It sounds like you have a big party and put locusts together and get it out.

11:01.940 --> 11:03.120
Oh, yeah, we do have a party.

11:04.440 --> 11:09.340
The people who come over to collate it look like they're not collating, they're mailing notes.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.540
And we get the issue back from the printer in the afternoon and one or two people may show up

11:15.120 --> 11:17.680
and help us put stamps on first-class copies.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.440
And then a larger crowd comes in the evening.

11:23.680 --> 11:32.060
They either get to get dinner and sit around and drink and put out the little labels

11:32.060 --> 11:33.600
or things and put them outside the order.

11:34.820 --> 11:38.640
And now it's a chronological order by Zip Code and they're stacked up then.

11:39.860 --> 11:42.300
And usually we finish by about 10.30 or 11.

11:42.420 --> 11:44.780
Everybody sits around and talks about science fiction.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.120
Very few of the people are of what you would call fans.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.280
They're almost all writers.

11:52.520 --> 11:57.880
In fact, we had a con cast last year for the best first novel by a locust co-liver.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.140
We did have three nominees.

12:02.680 --> 12:09.700
As far as I can tell, probably about 90% of the locusts collated are written at least one novel.

12:13.020 --> 12:14.900
Do you have any...

12:14.900 --> 12:17.860
Not a fan gallery, much professional gallery.

12:19.920 --> 12:25.740
Do you have any plans for locusts, things you'd like to do in the future, expand it, new areas, whatever?

12:26.360 --> 12:28.260
Actually, I'd like to do the opposite.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.500
I do not want to expand the magazine at all.

12:30.660 --> 12:32.220
It will expand anyway, it always does.

12:33.520 --> 12:38.060
But I have no interest in doing them with a bigger magazine.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.260
In fact, I find the magazine too big now and take the relation too far.

12:44.960 --> 12:52.380
I really want to do a magazine for a limited number of people where I can do it all myself at home.

12:53.660 --> 13:00.200
I'm very frightened about getting to the point where I need a large staff and an office and things like that.

13:01.340 --> 13:02.780
Everything's done at home right now.

13:04.160 --> 13:10.220
Some of the changes are always forced on us because there's more news that we feel we have to cover.

13:11.240 --> 13:15.080
As you probably noticed, we're doing a lot more international coverage lately.

13:16.480 --> 13:22.000
We're covering the Soviet Union and the European Convention.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.220
And we've had some articles about Chinese science.

13:25.420 --> 13:25.640
Again?

13:27.620 --> 13:34.640
And I'm off to China next week to explore and I'll be at the University of Shanghai to discuss what's going on there.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.980
Lucas has won countless awards.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.580
Does one become Boise about four?

13:46.900 --> 13:48.640
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

13:50.460 --> 13:51.580
Seven dollars, countless.

13:52.140 --> 13:53.620
Did you get Boise about that?

13:53.680 --> 13:54.800
No, it's just another award.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.080
I don't know what you're doing in college.

13:56.900 --> 14:00.960
Well, but I don't get tired of winning.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.100
I'm not a throttle spot.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.420
There have been complaints, but then I get a bother to do it.

14:11.020 --> 14:13.140
I solved the problem of complaints.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.180
I send Rachel up to pick them up every year.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.240
But I won't say anything wrong.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.620
As long as people vote to local, I'll gladly accept the Ugo.

14:27.940 --> 14:29.080
It's well deserved.

14:29.080 --> 14:33.680
I don't think anybody realistically other than competitors are going to complain.

14:34.320 --> 14:39.000
Well, I think it's more of a team effort than it was before.

14:39.180 --> 14:41.000
I could not put it out without people helping.

14:42.660 --> 14:45.140
And I appreciate that too.

14:48.020 --> 14:54.560
The one change that was happening with Lucas, unfortunately, is the one that seems to happen every year, which is the price for that.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.340
One of the things we do is, of course, we only got pages when we raised the price.

15:02.200 --> 15:07.580
But the problem with all the presses is what they're expensive to do.

15:11.960 --> 15:23.660
The engineer asked me to ask you when we were talking about fandom a while ago if you have any favorite fandom stories that you could relate, something that's funny or whatever that sticks in your mind from those days.

15:23.660 --> 15:27.040
I don't know if that was one of them, but I don't know what's appropriate.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.380
It was mostly my fandom of 1950.

15:30.760 --> 15:35.880
My fandom's period was about 1950 to 56.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.600
I don't know.

15:44.480 --> 15:49.660
Millions of other elements in the 1950s and the Civil War to the 1950s.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.340
And we're just together there.

15:54.920 --> 16:01.880
What I find interesting is that I've known these people now for more than 30 years.

16:02.180 --> 16:03.680
More than I've known my family.

16:05.460 --> 16:12.740
I'm in close contact with the science fiction group in 1950 that I have with my relatives.

16:16.980 --> 16:17.980
Funny stories?

16:19.280 --> 16:19.940
I don't know.

16:25.140 --> 16:30.900
No, I can't really think of a funny story.

16:31.380 --> 16:37.680
Okay, you have to ask, has Locust generated any letters of note through the years?

16:37.840 --> 16:40.860
You must get some crackpot or oddball letters.

16:40.860 --> 16:47.560
Oh, you know, you crackpot letters all the time and really strange letters and they usually throw them out.

16:48.620 --> 16:56.340
The years they've collected all these really far outlaid letters, waiting to publish them in a final issue.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.500
But it doesn't look like the other key of final issues, Locust.

17:00.740 --> 17:03.500
So there's no reason to keep them around anymore.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.700
We don't get that much mail on Locust.

17:09.800 --> 17:14.400
Mostly information, some complaints, but mostly state information.

17:15.240 --> 17:31.880
Very few letters of praise except for 15th anniversary, actually, we'll see all of the people who were some survivors in the region.

17:32.980 --> 17:34.920
Also, all of them were professional writers.

17:35.500 --> 17:42.980
And it was very nice getting back the first letter from Robert Heinlein and the second letter from Isaac Lassner and people like that,

17:43.680 --> 17:46.760
who are all our fans and we really appreciate what we're doing.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.820
I'll give you a tip that can not be punished as well, but the next issue is well-cooked.

17:55.700 --> 18:01.580
For those interested, Robert Heinlein just finished a new novel and turned it in and it's not a new novel.

18:02.740 --> 18:04.920
That would be lovely.

18:08.040 --> 18:13.560
You must have an interesting pipeline to the publishers.

18:13.900 --> 18:21.260
It seems to me I've heard apocryphal stories that authors said that they read about their new book being published in Locust.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.760
That's not apocryphal, that happens fairly often.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.080
How is that arranged?

18:26.320 --> 18:34.980
Before they send out the publishers to Locust, we've closed contact with all the publishers.

18:41.200 --> 18:51.800
Okay, we will take the show and cut it up and we'll probably do the taping in September and we'll send you a copy of it.

18:51.820 --> 18:55.380
So we do appreciate you getting to talk to you, David.

18:55.640 --> 18:56.840
Okay, I hope I answered your question.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.680
Oh yeah, just a second.

19:01.780 --> 19:04.540
Okay, listen, thanks a lot. Enjoy the pork.
