00:03.640 --> 00:10.580
I got paid out, but they certainly did the best they could.

00:11.680 --> 00:15.020
Grungeback was less willing to pay.

00:17.420 --> 00:25.520
Finally, I got a lawyer for the commercial fiction deal to collect while he owed me 20%.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.820
That was around $300.

00:28.180 --> 00:31.960
I almost paid for about $60,000 more in a copy.

00:33.720 --> 00:41.420
One of the things I wanted to ask you about was you started off with a sort of fantasy science fiction story of Metal Man,

00:41.520 --> 00:43.540
and then you went deeply into science fiction.

00:44.120 --> 00:47.560
But I think one of your most fascinating things that I read was darker than you think.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.020
What caused the change in your writing?

00:50.020 --> 01:00.520
Well, I'm not sure except that people change and grow and sometimes decay and whatever.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.640
When I wrote darker than you think, I was under psychoanalysis.

01:05.160 --> 01:14.880
I was in Hollywood for the conclusion that I first went to a doctor, Ted at the Menager Institute in Pica,

01:14.880 --> 01:22.000
and worked with him for about a year and then broke off for a couple of years and decided I needed some more.

01:22.320 --> 01:26.300
He moved to Beverly Hills in the meantime and then went out to the state another year.

01:28.080 --> 01:38.160
The psychiatrist in the story, as a man, reflects some attitudes toward Dr. Ted.

01:38.160 --> 01:50.020
I think it's probably unfair to him to say that, but it seems to me that looking back now at the story and what he tries to say,

01:52.360 --> 02:00.520
the White Will Barbie starts out in the terror of the forces of darkness,

02:01.500 --> 02:06.300
and in the end finds his part of it.

02:06.300 --> 02:09.440
And that in a way is reflection of my own experience.

02:09.740 --> 02:20.460
That is, I can remember a time when I felt that I was involved in a strong conflict between will and emotion,

02:20.820 --> 02:27.420
and I made resolutions that were difficult to keep and felt sort of divided against myself.

02:28.220 --> 02:33.220
As a result of partly of the analysis and partly of screwing up and living,

02:33.980 --> 02:44.280
I feel that I got to be not better integrated so that I'm not no longer so conscious of the internal conflicts

02:44.280 --> 02:52.140
of wanting to do things that I don't do or attempting to make resolutions that I won't be able to keep.

02:52.140 --> 03:06.880
So for them, I just have a degree of acceptance of myself, of the unconscious, of the whole human nature and the thought that I didn't have.

03:07.100 --> 03:11.460
I think that's probably the basic emotional structure of the novel.

03:12.240 --> 03:18.220
You weren't attempting then to, I mean, did you have any serious ideas about the Lecanthropy, the werewolf?

03:18.220 --> 03:21.780
That was the reason for that kind of genetic inheritance?

03:22.160 --> 03:35.600
Well, I think the Lecanthropy is an excellent or apt or whatever symbol for, let's say, the dark forces of the unconscious.

03:36.600 --> 03:44.440
I didn't necessarily have any serious belief in magic or Lecanthropy or whatever.

03:44.740 --> 03:56.800
It was purified as the other side fiction, but I'm fortunate invention because it was symbolic and expressive and so on its own way through.

03:59.420 --> 04:07.700
To go forward a little bit, another book I wanted to ask you about is Brother to Demon, Brother to Gods, more or less on genetic engineering and so forth.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.920
I took that book as fairly optimistic in its ending.

04:12.480 --> 04:17.060
I think it is. It was meant to be. I'm certainly interested in genetic engineering.

04:17.060 --> 04:30.260
It seems to me that the big scientific event of, well, 40 years ago when I read Hopland was the splitting of the atom.

04:31.120 --> 04:41.120
The unraveling of DNA has somewhat more profound consequences when we begin to realize them.

04:42.820 --> 04:51.840
Years ago I wrote a novel in which, well, so far as I know, that invented the terms of genetic engineering,

04:51.900 --> 04:57.260
or it had probably been around in other works called Dragon's Island.

04:57.800 --> 05:04.240
But that was published in 51, which was a couple of years before Watson and Crick made their breakthrough.

05:05.720 --> 05:15.900
Then more recently I decided to come back to it and to push the possibilities of genetic engineering as far as I could imagine.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.700
Would you accept it? Is it something you're for?

05:20.160 --> 05:25.480
Well, I don't think it's a matter of being for it or not. I think it's going to happen.

05:25.480 --> 05:33.140
I think that people are going to be opposed to it and there'll be conflicts and so forth.

05:33.340 --> 05:39.160
But assuming that science and technology remain alive,

05:39.540 --> 05:48.000
where I think genetic engineering is going forward, it has so many possible uses in the manufacture of insulin,

05:48.000 --> 06:01.000
and the manufacture of interferon, the possibilities for, let's say, improving health and happiness and comfort and longevity are so vast

06:01.540 --> 06:05.780
that you can't imagine people refusing to do it.

06:06.040 --> 06:16.860
And if we go ahead with it, it involves the potential of improving or changing and tinkering with the human germ plasm,

06:17.860 --> 06:19.940
rebuilding the race itself.

06:20.900 --> 06:35.460
And I say it's fascinating to watch and in the story, I set up the Smithwick family as the creators and had them recreating their own children

06:35.460 --> 06:39.940
so they would be better genetic engineers generation after generation.

06:39.940 --> 06:49.180
I set up these four creations, the true men who were genetically perfect,

06:49.620 --> 06:54.260
who were happy and smart and peaceful and good citizens of society,

06:54.520 --> 07:00.760
and the new men who were specialized for space or warfare or anything else.

07:01.120 --> 07:08.680
The gods who ruled and then discovering that the gods were created a little bit too much in the image of men

07:08.680 --> 07:13.940
so there needs to be another creation to supplant the gods,

07:14.120 --> 07:21.580
and the gods naturally don't want to be supplanted, and it struck me that this was, let's say, a beautiful dramatic situation

07:21.580 --> 07:29.320
with the essence of conflict and discovery and revelation,

07:29.320 --> 07:40.260
where these two naked kids on the premon reservation faced with the problem of keeping alive when the gods are after them

07:40.260 --> 07:47.440
to grow up and discover what they are and make the elder man to replace the gods.

07:47.860 --> 07:55.340
It was just fun to do, let's say, and I wouldn't say that it's possible, but I wouldn't say it's impossible.

07:55.340 --> 08:03.480
That is, I think that it is an amazing native exploration of what could happen.

08:03.760 --> 08:10.460
Would you say in that book that man is sort of controlling his own evolution?

08:11.060 --> 08:16.540
Well, it seems to me we can control our own evolution, and that in a way is not very remarkable

08:16.860 --> 08:24.020
because for many thousands of years we've been controlling the evolution of horses and cattle and dogs

08:24.020 --> 08:33.520
and so forth, so that obviously human evolution can be controlled in the sense that we're discovering,

08:33.780 --> 08:44.280
let's say, decoding the genetic message where we can do it more effectively and genetically, effectively, efficiently

08:44.280 --> 08:46.380
than it was ever done before.

08:47.200 --> 08:54.520
What about, this isn't exactly the same kind of material, but it is in a way that story on Guinevere for everybody about cloning.

08:57.420 --> 09:02.560
Is cloning something you can foresee as possible or good?

09:03.240 --> 09:10.380
I can't really say any good in it, not much good anyway, but it seems to me it's possible.

09:10.380 --> 09:22.740
We can already clone frogs and with continual refinement and laboratory processes and understanding and so forth.

09:23.180 --> 09:33.120
I can see cloning human beings, but a human clone, as far as I can see, is essentially an identical twin

09:34.020 --> 09:38.200
and not a sort of supernatural second self.

09:38.940 --> 09:46.800
So assuming that you had clones, it seems to me that they would have to be grown up individually and educated individually

09:46.800 --> 09:54.940
and they would not be doppelgangers in a second self, an instant duplicate, so the donor or whatever.

09:54.940 --> 10:04.160
But you can't see why it shouldn't happen and it seems to me that there's a possibility of using the cloning technique

10:04.160 --> 10:11.160
to, for example, to grow a new heart that would be a perfect replacement of a normal heart

10:11.160 --> 10:14.820
because it's grown out of the same tissue and such things as this.

10:14.820 --> 10:29.080
It might be possible to grow a whole series of implants and replacements that would make life go on almost essentially forever

10:29.080 --> 10:42.960
as far as I know that brain cells are not replaceable and they won't live forever, so I can't see that as a real way to immortality.

10:44.040 --> 10:48.320
One more question on this particular point. Say in reference to cloning or genetic engineering,

10:49.480 --> 10:55.760
would you say that there is no area of science that man, I mean, man can monkey with anything he wants?

10:55.900 --> 11:02.120
Is there anything which we shouldn't touch, which would be wrong for science to meddle with or monkey with?

11:03.140 --> 11:06.680
Well, I suppose I'm sort of a relative.

11:08.160 --> 11:19.200
Maybe I'm on Darwinian evolution. It's hard to find any absolute symbols or standards or whatever, what is wrong and right.

11:19.640 --> 11:29.740
If you look at the whole evolutionary picture, there are some things, patterns of growth and ways of behavior and so forth,

11:29.740 --> 11:33.960
and some of them lead to the survival of the individual and the species and some don't.

11:34.040 --> 11:48.860
And that's one available standard of behavior and if you look at that, why the technologies seem likely to survive and prevail unless they destroy themselves

11:49.740 --> 11:56.400
and whatever is going to destroy the race is obviously bad in that way.

11:56.400 --> 12:06.840
And it seems to me when we open the atom race, we're skating on thin ice and there might be similar hazards in genetic engineering

12:06.840 --> 12:11.900
that is theoretically we could design a form of life that could wipe us out.

12:12.840 --> 12:13.500
Maybe we will.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.520
Maybe we need the humanoids to keep us from doing that.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.040
That's what they're for.

12:20.420 --> 12:26.460
Personally, I'm being sort of an individualist. I hate to give up completely the humanoids.

12:28.340 --> 12:32.980
There is one more work. I keep forgetting about this one, the CT work, CT ship, CT shock.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.740
Is that the way that's pronounced by the way? CT contra-terine matter?

12:37.040 --> 12:44.060
Yes, it was abbreviated contra-terine with the letters C and T and I just spelled it out.

12:44.060 --> 12:49.660
That was a work I did for Kamal and enjoyed doing.

12:49.980 --> 12:58.580
I went to him with the idea for a series of stories about the planetary engineers who would terraform new worlds that is,

12:58.840 --> 13:08.960
would rebuild them, tinker with the atmosphere, the chemistry, maybe the gravitation, whatever to make them suitable for human settlement.

13:09.900 --> 13:15.480
Kamal suggested that some of these new worlds might be CT, that is, any matter,

13:15.600 --> 13:22.940
which was pretty new to science fiction then and I was fascinated and I did a series of stories

13:22.940 --> 13:25.680
and then a serial that eventually became two novels.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.180
Where did you come up with the concept terraformed? Did you coin that word or?

13:31.180 --> 13:41.760
As far as I know, I invented the word. In a few such terms that I think I can claim credit for, such as terraforming and sianics

13:41.760 --> 13:47.560
and the androids distinct from the Robert and so forth.

13:49.060 --> 13:55.780
Didn't the CT novel and the short stories lead into a syndicated strip in the newspapers?

13:55.780 --> 14:06.960
That was one of my exciting adventures. I was sitting at my desk one day when a phone rang and the editor of the New York Sunday News was on the line

14:06.960 --> 14:13.740
and wanted to know if I would come to New York and write a comic strip and I caught my breath and said I would.

14:14.600 --> 14:23.140
They had read one of the CT novels reviewed in the New York Times by a rather superior reviewer

14:23.140 --> 14:31.360
and said that the plot was pretty interesting but the way of writing made it look like a science fiction comic strip.

14:32.200 --> 14:40.940
This was in the early days of commercial TV when people were turning on the tube on Sunday morning instead of buying the Sunday news

14:40.940 --> 14:50.160
and somebody thought that if they had exclusive strips instead of syndicated strips that everybody else had it might give them a competitive age.

14:50.720 --> 14:59.660
There isn't a plan for new comics including a Western and a Mystery and a Fentra I think but the science fiction one was the only one they did.

15:00.200 --> 15:05.080
They ran for three years but eventually didn't turn out to be the answer to TV.

15:05.080 --> 15:13.860
The artist was Leah Lass who used to work with Mel Cunifalm, Terry and the Pirates and has a nice clean cut style.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.840
He was good with new and strange characters and good with machines.

15:19.740 --> 15:31.080
The thing was fun to do. My heart was broken when it ended because I had come to enjoy getting a regular check.

15:31.080 --> 15:42.860
It was at that time that I went back part time into the academic world because I had started taking college courses while the strip was running

15:42.860 --> 15:52.600
because it didn't take all my time to write it and I asked for a graduate assistantship and math and they didn't have one

15:52.600 --> 16:03.780
but I was stared to one in English which turned out to be a fortunate choice and the academic world did much very well with writing.

16:04.140 --> 16:11.760
It's wonderful to be paid to read good literature and talk about it with a congenial group of students.

16:12.260 --> 16:19.440
I enjoyed teaching and found that I was able to continue writing during holidays and vacations.

16:20.580 --> 16:29.740
Maybe I learned a little bit more about literature and about people and so forth. It was a very happy experience.

16:30.520 --> 16:35.080
Didn't you also put together one of the first courses on science fiction?

16:35.440 --> 16:42.260
I think so. Mark Heligans, the Colgate University, wrote the first one that I knew about.

16:42.260 --> 16:55.800
I was written up in the National Library and I kept the article out and showed it to the curriculum committee and chairman at Eastern

16:55.800 --> 16:59.480
and got approval for a course. What time was that?

16:59.480 --> 17:06.260
That was in, let's see, Heligans started his course in 1962 and I started mine in 1964.

17:06.600 --> 17:17.140
I taught it for a dozen years and spent part of those years doing all I could to promote academic science fiction elsewhere

17:17.140 --> 17:28.100
and accumulated descriptions of other courses and lectured and published articles and finally put together the textbook for science fiction teachers

17:28.100 --> 17:36.260
and anthology of articles by Lex, Elasimov, and Gwen, and Gunn, and others that has finally been published.

17:39.820 --> 17:51.660
I have a question about your own opinion on this. This may not be a fair question to ask of an author, but do you have favorite books,

17:51.660 --> 17:57.220
favorite stories, characters as you look back that you would say like most to be remembered for?

17:57.920 --> 17:58.520
Minimum?

17:58.940 --> 17:59.740
Yeah, in your own, yes.

17:59.980 --> 18:09.700
I think darker than you think is probably the thing, the novel, that I say fell into place most pleasingly.

18:10.740 --> 18:19.360
When I look back on it, it seems still to work. It's still engaging. It still means something.

18:19.360 --> 18:28.960
The human eye has been my most successful, most widely translated novel, but the original novelette

18:28.960 --> 18:37.400
with folded hands said essentially what I wanted to say in a more compact and satisfying way so that I always felt the novelette

18:37.400 --> 18:44.900
was a better story than the novel. That, in a way, has been my most successful and popular work.

18:45.100 --> 18:48.560
The novelette has been reprinted many, many times.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.760
How many languages has the human eye been translated into it?

18:52.000 --> 19:02.040
Well, I don't know, but most of the western European languages, Japan, and that's it. It's just going into sub-accuration and big-legged.

19:04.980 --> 19:06.040
It's gotten around.

19:07.640 --> 19:15.980
I want to, something about your working method. When you come up with a concept for a story, whatever it is, CT or humanoid, whatever,

19:15.980 --> 19:21.080
do you get a concept and then find a story to fit it, or do you have a story that you shove the concept into?

19:22.380 --> 19:22.820
Is there?

19:26.020 --> 19:34.680
Well, I'd like to say I think that it just grows. I often begin with some sort of abstract idea, like,

19:34.680 --> 19:46.580
well, the conflict of primitiveism and progress or whatever, and I look for the essence of conflict and the basic idea

19:46.580 --> 19:52.160
and then try to find characters or forces that embody this conflict.

19:52.620 --> 19:59.620
And in the early stages of it, where the whole thing is a very flexible, almost flimsy,

19:59.620 --> 20:04.460
you can do anything to it. You want to turn it inside out.

20:04.960 --> 20:18.940
But if it works, it gradually comes alive and the characters become real until they're well human beings that I feel that I know

20:19.620 --> 20:23.420
and it sort of change becomes very difficult to make.

20:24.460 --> 20:30.740
I noticed looking over some of your manuscripts at Eastern New Mexico University that you do revise.

20:30.940 --> 20:34.980
It seems to me that you had revised quite, is that a normal process of your writing to go back over?

20:35.260 --> 20:46.700
More and more. In the beginning, I saw myself as a pop writer and I was in a pop field with such figures as Max Brand

20:46.700 --> 20:55.040
who was said to write 4,000 words every day, including Sundays and send it out in rough draft.

20:55.660 --> 20:59.900
And of course, in his life, he said to publish between 30 and 40 million words.

21:00.580 --> 21:05.660
And I tried to do that for years and sometimes, believe it or not, it worked.

21:06.580 --> 21:14.920
Most of my work for several years was submitted in first draft and often accepted and liked by the fans.

21:14.920 --> 21:20.040
But as time goes on, I change the market changes.

21:21.560 --> 21:28.760
I become, I guess, more conscious of technique and ways that things can go wrong.

21:29.340 --> 21:37.360
So nowadays, when I write a paragraph, I have a tendency to take it apart and rewrite it instead of going wrong.

21:37.360 --> 21:44.100
Which was one reason for buying this new word processor because it seems to facilitate the revision immensely.

21:44.660 --> 21:57.960
You compose on a monitor and if you don't like what you see there, you can over type it or delete it or whatever and save whatever is good without having to retype it.

22:00.640 --> 22:08.420
How do you keep up with science? You must have a fairly extensive scientific background or any good science fiction writer must.

22:08.940 --> 22:15.680
Well, I've always been fascinated with science as a sort of unfolding mystery.

22:15.900 --> 22:21.500
That is, I want to know as much as I can about the nature of the origins of the universe.

22:21.500 --> 22:33.660
I subscribe to a whole group of magazines, Science News, Scientific American Science, which is the publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,

22:33.800 --> 22:38.640
which is much of a pretty technical but some things I can really understand.

22:39.360 --> 22:47.540
I subscribe to a couple of astronomy magazines. I subscribe to a couple of computer magazines since I bought the word processor.

22:49.780 --> 23:02.780
Occasionally I get off to other events. My wife and I attended the Jupiter flyby at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory March a year ago and got a short story out of that.

23:02.960 --> 23:09.580
I called it, they sent it to the great red spot, though I think the editor is changing the name of it.

23:09.580 --> 23:24.220
We've been invited back to the southern flyby come November and something like that, which gives you an opportunity to see actual science at work and science unfolding.

23:24.780 --> 23:37.200
It's about as exciting as anything could be. The Jupiter flyby, why the pictures of Jupiter and its satellites were coming in on the monitors one every 48 seconds.

23:37.200 --> 23:45.500
Most of them you would never be seen again. It was like some to form more study, but most of them were disappeared.

23:47.600 --> 23:58.880
It was just exciting. It was like exploring a new solar system. These satellites up to that time had just been spots light in the telescope.

23:58.880 --> 24:06.780
At the nearest, the best approaches where you could see details just a few kilometers across.

24:07.240 --> 24:18.880
Each satellite was different with a different history with different clues about the origins of itself and the whole solar system and maybe the universe.

24:19.420 --> 24:24.380
Things like that might make science as interesting as anything I know.

24:26.600 --> 24:34.600
To change the subject again, let's see if I remember now, you have been president of the Science Fiction Writers Association, are you still are?

24:35.000 --> 24:44.680
I finished my second term less than a month ago and I hope now to get back to more science fiction.

24:44.780 --> 24:45.640
The term is for how long?

24:45.640 --> 24:50.960
Each term is only for one year. It was a very rewarding experience.

24:51.920 --> 24:57.980
I guess I've said before science fiction is a pretty small, friendly, close community.

24:58.760 --> 25:06.940
A lot of people in it have been good friends over the years and it was an opportunity to try to do something for science fiction.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.780
But it took a good of a time.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.660
What were your duties if you don't mind me breaking?

25:12.660 --> 25:18.060
Well, we have about 500 members.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.780
We have all sorts of activities.

25:21.300 --> 25:34.080
One of the most important is a grievance committee that tries to, let's say, avoid difficulties with editors and publishers and so forth to make sure that they treat us right.

25:34.520 --> 25:40.300
We have the Nabila awards that are given each year to recognize work in the field.

25:40.300 --> 25:47.280
We attempt to also publicize and propagandize science fiction.

25:47.820 --> 25:55.420
And there are many, many people in the organization who devote a lot of priceless time and energy to this,

25:55.520 --> 26:02.340
but the whole thing has to be coordinated and people drop out and have to be replaced.

26:04.240 --> 26:12.460
Misunderstandings develop that have to be somehow explained and new projects come along that need to be supported.

26:12.900 --> 26:27.640
There wasn't any one thing that took a great deal of time, but there was a continual flow of problems and minor decisions and so forth.

26:27.640 --> 26:38.400
So that every week I'd have to spend maybe a couple of days catching up on my own phone calls and whatever.

26:38.980 --> 26:40.320
What are the criteria for membership?

26:40.820 --> 26:46.140
Does everybody automatically a member who publishes a story or does it have to take application?

26:46.140 --> 26:54.620
We have to make application and an affiliate member has to have at least one story professionally published.

26:54.860 --> 27:05.200
An active member, the requirement for that is three stories, short stories or short works that don't have to be fiction stories,

27:05.640 --> 27:08.420
or longer works such as a novel or whatever.

27:09.360 --> 27:15.500
The year is now of $40 a year and we have two publications,

27:15.940 --> 27:27.680
and monthly, well between them there are monthly a forum that is essentially for the members with official business and market reports and whatever.

27:27.680 --> 27:38.860
An abulled in that comes out four times a year that is devoted to more general articles, background material on science and science fiction.

27:40.560 --> 27:47.640
And the members are usually privileged to attend a self-wised read of the convention.

27:49.000 --> 27:56.920
And let's say membership is a sort of ticket to a club that I regard as exciting to belong to.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.760
You said there are some 500 members?

28:00.100 --> 28:04.460
That must be the largest, obviously the largest it's ever been, probably.

28:04.740 --> 28:07.020
Yes, it's still growing steadily.

28:08.160 --> 28:14.760
The science fiction market as well until the last year or so was booming.

28:17.720 --> 28:26.120
People back publishers had regular plans to publish four, six, sometimes eight titles a month.

28:27.640 --> 28:32.800
So that Charlie Brown of Locust was keeping a record of the books published,

28:33.040 --> 28:42.820
and that kept growing until the total past a thousand a year, about half reprint and half new, including fantasy as well as science fiction.

28:42.820 --> 28:48.760
And I think that, well since the depression of what I've written was,

28:48.900 --> 28:55.480
where money publishers had cut back their schedules and it's a little harder for a new writer to break in than it was,

28:55.780 --> 29:04.400
but it's still a very profitable and exciting field compared to what it was.

29:04.580 --> 29:07.920
When there was one magazine, I got 25 bucks for my first story.

29:08.600 --> 29:16.900
Of course the big money is from films and TV and such things.

29:17.740 --> 29:21.200
I know you said it's hard for you to keep up with everything that's being published today,

29:21.380 --> 29:28.960
but do you have any particularly favorite authors, the younger ones starting in the last ten years or so that you think are going to be valuable?

29:28.960 --> 29:35.500
Well, I don't follow well enough to say anything very intelligent.

29:36.260 --> 29:46.040
When I was teaching I regarded Ursula Le Guin's left hand of darkness as probably the best reason.

29:46.860 --> 29:55.720
Novel, I'm a great admirer of Heinlein, especially there, Heinlein Arthur Clark.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.240
But I don't really keep up.

30:01.400 --> 30:09.000
I just read and re-read some of Gordon Dixon's Child Cycle and he pressed

30:09.000 --> 30:16.380
for the broad, optimistic view of human change and evolution that he's presenting.

30:16.980 --> 30:23.320
What about new wave authors? I guess a new wave technically has passed I suppose, but what was your response to that?

30:23.320 --> 30:32.980
I felt that the new wave was, well, I was sort of adding new wave because I felt that new wave people were,

30:33.660 --> 30:43.260
first of all they were intensely pessimistic about science and they were trying to throw out the traditional,

30:44.280 --> 30:55.980
accepted literary patterns that at least were accepted by me and used in the field and turning back to literary experiments by people like

30:55.980 --> 31:03.020
Dose Paisos and James Joyce and tried a generation ago and they were brought on as they were something new again.

31:03.020 --> 31:17.540
But I think by and large, some of the new wave writers were very able and the impact of the new wave has been to improve the

31:17.540 --> 31:21.960
well-awareness of literary values of style and so forth.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.820
So by and large it's kind of a good thing.

31:24.820 --> 31:30.680
Is it possible to blend, say, the mainstream or the new wave attempt with good science fiction?

31:30.900 --> 31:35.320
Are they mutually exclusive or is it possible to have good mainstream material at science fiction?

31:35.400 --> 31:44.200
Well, I'm not enthusiastic about consolidating mainstream literature and science fiction,

31:44.200 --> 31:55.440
but I also remember that there was a time when science fiction wasn't well-off in the category by itself and I don't think there's any reason it should be.

31:55.580 --> 32:06.800
Welles was publishing his stories, they were just novels and romances, whatever, and the science fiction was in a sort of ghetto,

32:07.520 --> 32:10.200
you know, for a generation.

32:10.780 --> 32:17.160
I think this was partly due to the fact that he was published in pop magazines and people looked down on the popes.

32:17.560 --> 32:27.560
I think we started getting over that, but it's still a category, a publisher's category, like westerns or gothic,

32:27.560 --> 32:41.880
so low romances or whatever, and that means that if Don Wilhelm or Judy Lynn Del Rey or someone else packages a book in a recognizable science fiction package,

32:42.260 --> 32:52.360
it'll sell enough copies to make a profit, but it's a, I saw a limited profit because it is shelved in the science fiction racks and the stands,

32:52.360 --> 33:06.940
and the general public doesn't see it, so people who get to be best sellers, successful, people like Vani Gutt and so forth,

33:07.400 --> 33:12.980
tend to want to get the science fiction label off their stories when they begin to sell enough copies,

33:13.260 --> 33:17.900
but I've never reached that stage when I saw if I'm proud to have money called science fiction.

33:18.680 --> 33:25.820
Well, you mentioned the general public. Probably the general public wouldn't be included as say fans of science fiction.

33:26.260 --> 33:32.720
Is science fiction always going to be a separate thing? Is it still separate where you have to be a member almost of a cult or an in-group to a...

33:32.720 --> 33:43.100
Well, let's say some science fiction, I think one thing, the most important thing that's happened in the field is the diversification of it.

33:43.100 --> 33:55.720
Instead of having one readership, we have many readerships and there's a limited group that are interested in, let's say, the possibilities of hard science

33:55.720 --> 34:10.640
in a serious look at science fiction to explore possibilities of future social evolution, cultural change, the psychological impact, new technologies, and whatever.

34:10.640 --> 34:22.860
And there are more people who are interested in characterization and story value and maybe literature is a scuddy, so I think that we won't just help.

34:22.860 --> 34:38.840
I want one science fiction, but many varieties of it, but it seems to me that as far as I can see ahead, there should be a public far quote,

34:39.000 --> 34:48.700
science fiction just as there still is for westerns and Micheals, other identifiable categories.

34:49.540 --> 34:59.080
You don't see a more, say comparing, you're uniquely qualified to do this, say comparing the readership of science fiction today with say back in the 30s or early 40s.

34:59.720 --> 35:05.240
Wouldn't you say a greater proportion of the population reads and appreciates science fiction?

35:05.800 --> 35:18.440
I think so. When I started, nobody knew what it was. You had to explain it. There was one science fiction magazine, some science fiction stories were running in magazines like Galaxy Inn.

35:19.520 --> 35:29.280
People like Wells, Conan Dahl had been publishing occasional science fiction, not for a specialized audience, all along.

35:30.420 --> 35:45.960
But certainly there are more people reading it now than there ever were before, but there are a lot more people who see it on TV or see science fiction movies than ever read any of it.

35:45.960 --> 35:55.580
When you go to a convention these days, one of the Star Trek fans and the comic book fans and the Star Wars fans, and so forth,

35:55.860 --> 36:06.180
I remember the science fiction fans. A couple of weeks ago I was at a convention in Phoenix that was attended by, I think about 800 people,

36:06.180 --> 36:25.180
and I was really the only identifiable hard science fiction writer at that. There were Star Wars characters, and there were comic books, authors, and so forth who had the big public.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.520
I'm no complaint about that.

36:28.560 --> 36:34.440
You don't think that hurts the kind of science fiction that you value more, say the movies, the television, that kind of material?

36:34.440 --> 36:50.580
Well, movies have very seldom been good science fiction. There have been a few good science fiction films, but the science fiction of the sort I like has been called a literature of ideas,

36:50.580 --> 37:03.700
and to some extent it is, and the films, I think, necessarily deal not in ideas but with emotions, with sensation. I just saw The Shining,

37:04.260 --> 37:16.140
and I liked it as a superb piece of filmic craftsmanship. Dear people, in order to scatter the socks off the audience and buy them large,

37:16.140 --> 37:27.360
you can do as well as anybody ever will. There are people who feel it is a neglected characterization and feel that the explanation of the supernatural is not consistent,

37:27.880 --> 37:39.180
but I feel that, to what you were doing, you did it. Considering consistency, why it seems to me that he was making the deliberate appeal to the irrational,

37:39.180 --> 37:52.120
to the inexplicable, to the totally mysterious, if he tried to explain all the ghosts in the old hotel where he would have been laying down the suspense at the same time.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.240
So I love it.

37:55.160 --> 37:59.020
Do you think there have been any successful science fiction movies in your Goodlands?

37:59.020 --> 38:18.700
2001, I think, was tremendous. There are a number of others that are regarded as classics, but typically the movies and TV haven't done what might have been done.

38:18.700 --> 38:30.460
In the first year or two of Star Trek, they were buying professionally published science fiction stories, or stories written by professional writers,

38:30.660 --> 38:41.920
and I thought many of them were pretty good. And gradually, as time went on, they went more and more into the standard Hollywood format,

39:10.940 --> 39:11.900
and had less and less originality, creativity, and support.

39:11.900 --> 39:25.960
They don't care about ideas, about consistency, or whatever. All they're trying to do is create emotional effect, that if you know too much science or care too much about believability, why the emotional effect doesn't work.

39:26.540 --> 39:38.540
I'm about to ask a very broad question so you can feel free to edit it down to a better size. What do you think goes into making a good science fiction story?

39:40.860 --> 39:53.980
Well, of course, I'm something I'll believe in myself in emotional effects. That is, you need a strong conflict, and you need something that will involve the reader emotionally,

39:53.980 --> 40:12.540
so that you need characters that he can either hate or identify with, and you need some sense of originality, if you get it, something new, though that is not always possible.

40:13.760 --> 40:40.540
I tend myself to look for a theme for some sort of significant statement about science or the future, or the impact of science and technology on individual human beings, on human life, on society, on what the world might be.

40:43.280 --> 40:57.580
I think all of it is important for the writer to be genuinely interested in what he's saying about something relevant to science and technology and change.

40:57.580 --> 41:19.600
It seems to me the essential thing is probably that science fiction recognizes that the world is changing under the impact of technology. The future is going to be different, and the mainstream audience either doesn't know this or prefers to forget it or whatever.

41:20.360 --> 41:30.600
That's a good distinction to make. I was going to ask you, is that something you presented in your classes when you taught science fiction that it's concerned with change and distinction in mainstream material?

41:32.860 --> 41:44.680
Speaking of your teaching, why do you think science fiction, say, should be taught, say, is far down as junior high, junior high, high school, college? Is there any particular value it can offer students?

41:45.480 --> 42:01.860
Well, I think that assuming that science fiction does deal with change, the world is really changing. So the recognition of this is an element of reality or realism that you don't have in a lot of classic literature.

42:02.420 --> 42:13.440
And kids growing up are going to be living in a world that's different from the world around them now. It seems to me they have a legitimate interest in what the future is going to be.

42:13.440 --> 42:27.820
And in a practical teaching situation, you're trying to pull kids off the playground out in front of the TV and teach them to read and to understand and to think.

42:28.370 --> 42:45.580
And sometimes this is pretty difficult. I've tried various approaches to various literary figures and periods, and some of them work very well and some of them don't.

42:45.580 --> 43:05.200
And it seems to me that science fiction offers a sort of bridge or a door or whatever to the interest of a lot of students that you don't have if you try to go back to Shakespeare, let's say.

43:08.160 --> 43:18.900
Yeah, I think one thing science fiction forces a person who's reading it to do is to think about the future and to think about the world is living in this is related to the future.

43:19.180 --> 43:24.140
I think that's basically what it's about. They're as much as you can say it's about anything.

43:25.580 --> 43:35.280
And it seems to me that generally you can classify it more or less as utopian or dystopian.

43:35.540 --> 43:47.680
That is, you can look for some assumption that the technology is good or that technology is bad, that the future is going to be better or the future is going to be worse.

43:47.680 --> 44:08.120
Or that the human being is a helpless victim of his environment and his own nature, or that he can make significant decisions and change his environment and make things better than they were.

44:09.640 --> 44:14.160
That was basically the approach I took in my classes.

44:15.480 --> 44:26.040
I like to begin with the second two books of Goldfish's Progress, which has written a deliberate criticism of the early scientists of the raw society and so forth.

44:26.040 --> 44:33.360
I think that's the first thing I want to do to preside as far as I could, is to select stories that would be brief on both sides.

44:34.460 --> 44:48.480
Dystopias and jute-topias, optimism and pessimism, selection from such people as Ralph Clark and Heinlein and so forth on one side.

44:48.480 --> 45:01.080
I've made my own, you know, I'd say plenty of dystopian fiction, usually better written and more engaging than the optimistic.

45:01.740 --> 45:13.080
Well, though, if you're going to categorize like that, say you put Wells and Huxley and Swift, maybe Ellison on the one hand, maybe Heinlein, Asimov, people like that on the other,

45:13.080 --> 45:19.500
I would put you on that side, the second side with the optimist or the utopian, ultimately, even though you did write the humanoids.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.200
Well, that's where I like to be.

45:21.380 --> 45:22.720
Okay, that's fair.

45:24.460 --> 45:25.980
David, I've only got one more question.

45:26.460 --> 45:27.400
I don't know what...

45:27.400 --> 45:28.680
The tape's running out too.

45:32.000 --> 45:40.140
Maybe I misinterpreted something you wrote, Dr. Williamson, but I thought I read somewhere where you were skeptical of the possibility of finding intelligent alien life elsewhere.

45:40.140 --> 45:42.720
No, I don't think I read.

45:43.580 --> 45:53.400
Well, I'm skeptical about our actually finding it because the universe is so vast and communication is so difficult.

45:53.820 --> 45:57.840
There's two chains of probability or whatever.

45:57.840 --> 46:10.060
It's been proven that, let's say, the stuff of life originates elsewhere, even in galactic clouds before there are any planets.

46:10.660 --> 46:18.100
So the stuff of life is there and life could theoretically develop on any planet.

46:18.380 --> 46:25.440
And according to the best theories, the galaxy is full of planets, so it ought to be there.

46:25.440 --> 46:34.000
But on the other hand, we have a record of evolution for four and a half billion years or whatever in the solar system,

46:34.000 --> 46:37.400
and there's no evidence that anything alien ever turned up here.

46:38.220 --> 46:46.560
And at our best speeds so far, it would take many thousand years to get to another world.

46:46.560 --> 46:54.580
And I'm just skeptical that the flying saucers are in a planetary vis-tager or whatever.

46:55.360 --> 47:06.800
But I can see a possibility of, let's say, radio communication or picking up radio signals or laser signals or something else.

47:06.800 --> 47:15.640
But it also seems that this would have to go at the speed of light, which takes 100,000 years to cross the galaxy,

47:15.640 --> 47:21.000
so any very intimate conversation would take a lot of time.

47:21.180 --> 47:24.700
Well, you've invented a couple ways for people to go faster than light, haven't you?

47:24.920 --> 47:25.180
Yes.

47:26.780 --> 47:32.860
A very fine, Jerry Fineberg, before the invention of the Tachyon, that I adopted,

47:33.680 --> 47:44.140
and I've invented other devices of my own, and I regard these as necessary for, as I say, pieces of fictional machinery,

47:44.140 --> 47:47.100
but I'm not sure they're going to work in reality.

47:48.200 --> 47:54.060
People keep saying that the Einstein speed of light limit is not absolute,

47:54.340 --> 47:58.860
but there's a good deal to be said for it in practical terms.

47:58.860 --> 48:05.800
But to summarize, in other words, you're not skeptical about the existence or the possibility of intelligent light,

48:06.020 --> 48:07.500
just that we would be able to contact it.

48:08.300 --> 48:12.920
That's the... I don't see why it shouldn't be there.

48:13.300 --> 48:22.840
Of course, there's a sort of appalling possibility that an evolving species opens up the atom and commits instantaneous suicide,

48:23.180 --> 48:25.680
but you can hope that wouldn't always happen.

48:29.240 --> 48:30.640
Thank you.
