WEBVTT

00:02.700 --> 00:07.120
Okay, I want to do that last because I realized time is at a premium, so we'll get into that

00:07.120 --> 00:08.100
if we have time.

00:08.320 --> 00:14.840
So let's get started then, so I'll try to put on my formal voice and sound like an interviewer

00:14.840 --> 00:15.020
then.

00:15.960 --> 00:16.440
Okay.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.080
You have all the background most hard science fiction writers only dream of, yet your books

00:22.080 --> 00:25.240
are written with obvious emphasis on style and characterization.

00:25.980 --> 00:27.980
Why is this your focus and not the science?

00:29.480 --> 00:36.340
Well, I tend to believe that you should play all your suits if you're going to be an earnest

00:37.080 --> 00:37.400
writer.

00:38.140 --> 00:45.000
You should deal with both style and content, background and characterization and everything.

00:45.720 --> 00:54.980
I certainly include a large dollop of science in my work, I think, and I try to blend this

00:54.980 --> 00:57.720
together with the kind of people who do science.

00:58.220 --> 01:03.600
That's my real interest is this impact of science on people and the other way around.

01:06.780 --> 01:13.680
Do you think that mainstream and science fiction are separate categories or, well, I guess they

01:13.680 --> 01:16.880
are now, but do you think they shouldn't be melded or do you think they should keep this

01:16.880 --> 01:18.480
separate identity?

01:20.320 --> 01:27.960
I think that mainstream and any genre like SF are, in a sense, two ends of a spectrum.

01:28.580 --> 01:30.320
One blends into the other.

01:31.060 --> 01:38.400
There are obviously the books that only science fiction addicts will read, which are incomprehensible

01:38.400 --> 01:41.900
to ordinary readers, and that defines a boundary.

01:41.900 --> 01:46.820
But obviously, it's a gradual transition from one to the other.

01:48.060 --> 01:55.900
Science is in science fiction not the really crucial dividing point.

01:56.760 --> 02:02.420
There are many things in science fiction which set it apart which are not connected with

02:03.000 --> 02:08.220
knowing a great deal of science, but rather with knowing a lot of accepted bits of jargon

02:08.220 --> 02:15.920
or common places we've assumed about the future, the way galactic empires are put together

02:15.920 --> 02:19.220
and so forth, usually very simple minded, like my estimation.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.180
An ordinary reader coming to these things simply cannot understand them, therefore he rather

02:27.180 --> 02:28.940
usually quickly gives up.

02:30.800 --> 02:37.760
But therefore I think that it's the mannerisms of SF that tend to set it apart as much as

02:37.760 --> 02:38.500
anything else.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.060
Of course, science fiction is concerned with content, a great deal more than other literature,

02:44.960 --> 02:47.360
and therefore that scares off people too.

02:49.320 --> 02:53.820
Do you read a great deal of science fiction or mainstream or have a preference for one

02:53.820 --> 02:54.200
or the other?

02:55.160 --> 03:02.720
I read, when I can, the best science fiction and the best in the mainstream, and also,

03:03.240 --> 03:06.700
for example, hard boiled detective stories and a lot of other things.

03:06.700 --> 03:12.620
Now I keep up on the prominent short story writers in America, for example.

03:13.300 --> 03:16.040
So I try to read eclectically.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.840
Excuse me, I'll say it again eclectically.

03:21.960 --> 03:27.300
But of course everyone if they get older has less time to read, particularly if they're

03:27.300 --> 03:31.120
actually engaged in the real world and have some other job other than being a writer.

03:31.980 --> 03:37.240
Do these other works influence your style continually or do you think you've got that

03:37.240 --> 03:37.780
set now?

03:38.560 --> 03:41.680
I don't really think that I've got a style.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.400
I certainly have some identifiable mannerisms.

03:45.040 --> 03:50.940
But it seems to me that every one of my books is written somewhat differently and I do change

03:52.340 --> 03:55.260
style and approach fairly often.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.000
I may be wrong about that.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.960
Many people may think that there is a noticeable Benford style.

04:04.240 --> 04:10.740
But I don't think that I pick up those things from my reading directly, although certainly

04:10.740 --> 04:12.100
I'm influenced by a lot of writers.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.020
Every writer is influenced by people who came before.

04:15.020 --> 04:20.380
Otherwise we'd have to invent literature a whole each time we sat down to do a novel.

04:22.400 --> 04:26.900
Your novel, Timescape, just won the Nebula Award, which congratulations, by the way.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.000
How did you come to write that?

04:30.020 --> 04:32.540
I took ten years to write Timescape.

04:32.880 --> 04:38.020
It's written out of my experience as a graduate student at the University of California in

04:38.020 --> 04:38.980
the 1960s.

04:39.740 --> 04:42.880
Two-thirds of the book occurs in 1962 and 63.

04:44.200 --> 04:51.280
And I had always noticed that science fiction very seldom dealt with the life of a scientist

04:51.280 --> 04:55.120
as it is really lived as I thought.

04:56.770 --> 05:03.960
So when I began to think about writing a book about time, a subject that had already and

05:03.960 --> 05:10.980
always fascinated me, and which science fiction had, it seemed to me, done to death, I began

05:10.980 --> 05:17.580
in fact to think about the way scientists would really try to attempt to transmit information

05:17.580 --> 05:18.360
across time.

05:18.750 --> 05:23.880
Not time travel, but simple time telegrams, if you will.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.120
And how would it happen?

05:26.440 --> 05:27.640
What would make people do it?

05:28.100 --> 05:29.340
How would it be received?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.580
What would scientists think about it?

05:32.280 --> 05:37.860
Because you see the basic ingredient in the novel is to treat time communication like

05:37.860 --> 05:48.340
a new paradigm in science so that you have scientists confronting something that's very

05:48.340 --> 05:49.800
standard way of doing science.

05:50.220 --> 05:53.740
After all, here's an experiment that's being interfered with and seems to be carrying a

05:53.740 --> 05:55.340
message, how bizarre.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.180
And so this is like a scientist encountering a brand new scientific idea.

06:03.700 --> 06:11.680
So you get to see in a dramatic fashion how scientists deal with ambiguity and the unusual

06:12.420 --> 06:15.780
nature of their work, which does crop up now and then.

06:15.780 --> 06:17.940
And after all, that's what scientific revolutions are about.

06:18.580 --> 06:22.320
And at the same time, the reader can understand what's going on.

06:22.420 --> 06:27.080
It's not an arcane matter about genetics or a nuclear physics that's going on.

06:27.380 --> 06:32.300
He knows more than any of the characters, all the way through the book.

06:33.260 --> 06:41.540
And that was what made me think of this as a scheme to show readers things about scientists

06:41.540 --> 06:48.240
that just couldn't be told in the normal way in the world of the, say, the Allah, what's

06:48.240 --> 06:51.800
the double helix and so forth, which is about a specific experiment in the past.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.600
So that was the motivation.

06:54.520 --> 06:59.300
And as you can see, it's sort of a barely science fictional motivation.

07:00.580 --> 07:07.380
I really wanted to talk about both the 60s and 1998 where the message is sent from.

07:07.820 --> 07:15.060
But mostly from the point of view of us right here and right now, 1981, I deliberately made

07:15.580 --> 07:22.360
the dates of the book fixed so that the book was published in hardback in 1980, exactly

07:22.360 --> 07:25.700
halfway between the two times that are the subject of the book.

07:28.440 --> 07:34.780
And that and the context of making comments on political matters and the end of being

07:34.780 --> 07:40.000
able to show a scene from the 1970s that's very different from our 1970s.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.740
All those things made me want to write the book, but then took a mere decade to actually

07:44.740 --> 07:45.240
write it.

07:47.260 --> 07:52.440
You made the novel real to me and to other readers who I've talked to with the little

07:52.440 --> 07:58.280
details, the songs on the radio in the 60s and the current events, 35 cent paperback,

07:58.380 --> 07:59.180
which was hard to believe.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.240
And then how the people were coping with the future.

08:03.080 --> 08:07.680
The thing that really intrigued me was the mercury hunt in the Sewers and England.

08:08.680 --> 08:16.600
This technique of putting in the little realistic scenarios to portray the future in the past

08:16.600 --> 08:18.800
is something that I haven't encountered all that much.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.440
How did you develop that?

08:21.300 --> 08:28.040
Well, that really comes out of thinking very hard for a decade about the matter.

08:28.040 --> 08:34.580
Every once in a while it occurred to me, in the case of the 1998 world, to think about

08:34.580 --> 08:39.760
what ordinary activities they would have that would seem strange to us.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.160
And as the years went on, I would think of these things and jot them down and then I

08:45.160 --> 08:48.340
would try to write a scene about them and to involve a character in them.

08:49.540 --> 08:56.460
I think this method is just living in the world you're writing about for a long time

08:56.460 --> 09:01.140
until it gets to be second nature and you can select from it things you want to show

09:01.140 --> 09:01.620
the readers.

09:02.420 --> 09:08.160
There are whole chapters of timescales which I wrote and reflect on both the present and

09:08.160 --> 09:12.040
the past and finally excluded from the novel feeling that they weren't really necessary.

09:12.260 --> 09:16.240
But there are old facets of the world I worked out and then did use.

09:16.960 --> 09:21.500
Of course, doing the 1960s was straight realistic writing.

09:22.560 --> 09:30.360
I simply did a point for point detailed narrative set in a world that I knew and had lived through

09:30.860 --> 09:34.160
and could remember, I was surprised in enormous detail.

09:34.460 --> 09:40.220
I could remember the newspaper headline, the incidents, who was fighting who for the heavyweight

09:40.220 --> 09:41.400
championship, the whole thing.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.080
And of course, those are just the approaches of the realistic novelist.

09:47.340 --> 09:54.200
So that's what I used and I think the big help was that I did not think of it as being

09:54.200 --> 09:58.560
a science fiction novel that maybe white doesn't feel like a science fiction novel.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.120
In a way, I think it is a science fiction novel.

10:04.380 --> 10:07.880
A lot of real life people inhabited timescales.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.240
Most of them were in the past but some of them were in the future.

10:10.420 --> 10:15.140
I noticed that Davies and Thorne were in the future and even Freeman Dyson had an active

10:15.140 --> 10:16.280
part in the book.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.900
He did some talking and kind of got the hero in trouble.

10:19.540 --> 10:23.880
Do you know most of these people and do you need their permission to put them in a book?

10:24.240 --> 10:25.640
Did they get a kick out of it?

10:26.100 --> 10:31.500
Well, the people who actually have walk on speaking parts who are identified as real

10:31.500 --> 10:34.200
people, I got the permission from.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.300
Freeman Dyson, particularly.

10:37.320 --> 10:42.000
People who were mentioned in passing, I didn't ask for permission because after all, they

10:42.000 --> 10:44.020
are people in the world and you can't refer to them.

10:44.380 --> 10:46.200
No one has a copyright on their name.

10:48.920 --> 10:55.960
But so far no one is ejected to being mentioned or even talked about in the tale in the book.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.740
Dyson certainly did not.

11:00.580 --> 11:07.300
And I don't think any of the disguised characters have said anything about it either.

11:07.300 --> 11:13.820
There are some relatively well-known scientists in the book who are, I would say, rather than

11:13.820 --> 11:15.900
a legal seal, the black concealed nonetheless.

11:18.240 --> 11:23.260
That for me was one of the good things about the book, being able to use my experience

11:23.260 --> 11:29.600
and all the people whom I knew and being able to talk about them the way they are moral

11:29.600 --> 11:33.680
has not always a complementary but that's life, isn't it?

11:35.120 --> 11:39.140
I'd say you knew the twins from Oklahoma quite well from what I gather.

11:39.460 --> 11:47.040
Yes, well, there are some twins from Oklahoma who are not named in there who are in fact

11:47.040 --> 11:48.700
myself and my twin brother.

11:49.600 --> 11:57.480
I had just come from the University of Oklahoma to La Jolla in 1963 and decided what the hell

11:57.480 --> 11:58.700
I would just put myself in the book.

11:58.820 --> 12:00.760
In fact, I appear in the book in several different places.

12:02.700 --> 12:06.840
Have you gotten any feedback from people that normally read mainstream novels about

12:06.840 --> 12:11.960
timescape saying, gee, this is science fiction, it can't be good, but it was or something

12:11.960 --> 12:12.540
like that?

12:13.160 --> 12:19.940
Well, yes, I've gotten a fair number of letters, phone calls and so on from people who, quote,

12:20.080 --> 12:24.740
don't usually read science fiction, unquote, and are surprised to find that they're science

12:24.740 --> 12:29.920
fiction and actually have all the virtues of a regular novel and still be science fiction.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.680
Well, it's good that these people are catching on to that fact.

12:34.580 --> 12:39.740
Admittedly, the field has not given them a large number of examples to learn from, but

12:39.740 --> 12:41.480
I hope we will in the future.

12:42.480 --> 12:47.620
Of course, the reason we haven't produced such books before is because it's stamped hard.

12:48.400 --> 12:58.120
It's a lot of work and science fiction is typically not a field which was a reward taking a decade

12:58.120 --> 12:58.900
to write a book.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.300
That's a sad fact.

13:01.600 --> 13:01.900
It's true.

13:02.680 --> 13:06.840
Did you ever fear during these 10 years that this book might not be a commercial success

13:06.840 --> 13:11.800
because of the subject matter and the emphasis on characterization and so forth?

13:12.560 --> 13:12.960
Definitely.

13:13.940 --> 13:18.340
But I decided to what the hell I was going to write the book the way I wanted to and I

13:18.340 --> 13:20.920
didn't care how it would do.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.060
In fact, when I finished the manuscript, I was pretty convinced that I would be able

13:26.060 --> 13:30.020
to sell it for only a minimal advance and that would be just about it.

13:30.640 --> 13:36.380
The overwhelming success, as far as I'm concerned, of this book.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.800
It's now won four awards.

13:39.560 --> 13:44.200
She said the Nebula has a British award, the Australian, and now the John W. Campbell International

13:44.200 --> 13:44.840
Award.

13:46.520 --> 13:52.700
And to have sold the Well and Hardback and now it's second printing and paperback after

13:52.700 --> 13:59.140
having been out for less than four weeks, that kind of reception is to be astounding,

14:00.260 --> 14:01.340
completely unanticipated.

14:02.180 --> 14:08.140
I personally thought it was by far the best piece of writing I'd ever done, but that doesn't

14:08.140 --> 14:09.640
mean I thought it was going to be commercial.

14:09.940 --> 14:10.640
In fact, I didn't.

14:13.780 --> 14:19.460
Your earlier books had elements of mysticism and transcendental experiences in them, which

14:19.460 --> 14:20.660
were missing from Time's Gate.

14:21.180 --> 14:27.280
Is this a facet of your personality, this enamor with mysticism?

14:28.220 --> 14:29.280
Well, yes.

14:29.480 --> 14:34.700
I tend to put material like that in my books because I think it's there in the sense that

14:34.700 --> 14:37.640
there is a mystical content in science.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.880
So many people have commented on it.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.000
I have a feeling maybe I should let it go for a while.

14:45.320 --> 14:50.100
Of course, it's not really true that the Time's Gate doesn't have elements of mysticism in it.

14:50.180 --> 14:56.220
There is the last long chapter, certainly interpreted in a number of different ways, and there are some very,

14:56.440 --> 15:02.900
very transcendental moments in that last portion of the book.

15:03.020 --> 15:08.360
But certainly the emphasis is much less than in my early work.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.260
You're right about that.

15:09.860 --> 15:16.100
Do you think being so well acquainted with quantum physics puts you in a special position to look at

15:16.100 --> 15:21.040
mystical and transcendental experiences, or would you have it anyway?

15:23.840 --> 15:27.440
Well, that's kind of a chicken and egg question.

15:27.700 --> 15:33.280
One of the reasons I'm interested in quantum mechanics is because it seems to me to be a very fundamental,

15:34.780 --> 15:36.600
transcendental way of viewing the world.

15:37.600 --> 15:43.600
And therefore I tend to use material like that in my books and my wish to look at things from that angle.

15:45.260 --> 15:52.980
So to me it's just another facet of the world that seems to reward being looked at from a transcendental point of view.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.100
I'm mostly, however, a rather realistic novelist.

15:59.220 --> 16:03.440
I'm not really, I don't think of myself as being a mystical writer.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.140
Maybe others do.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.260
I think it's true.

16:10.340 --> 16:18.160
Larry Niven has said that any time travel story is perforce a fantasy, since the known laws of physics prohibit it.

16:18.160 --> 16:27.300
As a physicist, do you foresee any loopholes that might allow time travel or time communication or faster than light travel,

16:27.420 --> 16:29.020
which this would all tie together?

16:29.600 --> 16:30.260
Well, yes.

16:30.480 --> 16:40.900
Of course, the timescale at its basis says, suppose there is this particle called a tachyon, which travels faster than light.

16:40.900 --> 16:49.860
The tachyon has been talked about in scientific literature for about 20 years, and hundreds of papers have been written about it.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.580
I've written one myself.

16:52.740 --> 17:01.500
So if the tachyon exists, it certainly implies faster than light, and therefore reverse time communication.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.000
That's the whole point about timescales.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.480
It's about, it's set in a world in which you say, suppose this is true.

17:12.060 --> 17:16.340
As far as time travel goes, I don't have the slightest clue how to do it.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.980
Maybe it turns out I'd end a tachyon and shoot it backward in time.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.560
It's hard to see how you could do it.

17:22.980 --> 17:23.200
That's all.

17:23.300 --> 17:27.100
We can't transport someone spatially now, just with waves.

17:27.360 --> 17:28.460
You can't teleport.

17:29.500 --> 17:40.080
So I think in the sense that Niven meant it, yes, time travel is a fantasy in the strict sense that science doesn't tell us how to do it.

17:40.820 --> 17:54.380
But the seduction of time travel stories is the great feeling of perspective they give you, and being able to contrast past, present, and future so easily.

17:55.860 --> 17:59.500
So I think that those stories are going to go on for a very long time.

17:59.540 --> 18:02.400
Everyone loves them, and I do too.

18:03.540 --> 18:09.120
They have produced, that area has produced some of the best SSF ever written.

18:09.440 --> 18:17.700
So I really think it makes sense to continue the convention in the face of quite well-founded scientific ejection.

18:19.580 --> 18:27.060
You rewrote deeper than the darkness as the stars enshroud, and I understand that you perhaps may go back and reduce some other old works.

18:27.400 --> 18:32.060
Why do you choose to rewrite the old books rather than put all your energy into something new?

18:33.720 --> 18:43.380
Basically because I didn't want the old works to appear with my name on them when I could see that they were so deeply flawed, and I thought I could do a better job.

18:44.140 --> 18:57.180
I don't think I'm going to do that with any more of my books, but I certainly greatly revised a novel of mine, a sort of a homage to the Heinlein Juvenile called the Jupiter Project.

18:57.740 --> 19:05.100
I revised that when it went into paperback, and I did that as you said with the stars enshroud.

19:05.100 --> 19:20.380
But basically I don't like to have less than my best in front of the public, and I care more about craftsmanship than I do about storing up my energies for the next project.

19:21.100 --> 19:34.180
I would prefer to salvage an old work than hammer away at a new one if I could be contented that at least I had never done anything I thought was really dreadful and allowed it to go out in public.

19:34.180 --> 19:43.980
A lot of writers don't feel this way, and I understand particularly economically why they would believe so, but I don't have to write so much.

19:44.720 --> 19:48.900
Writing is a hobby for me, so I could do it as I like. Thank God.

19:51.420 --> 19:59.820
How do you juggle writing of the obvious caliber that you practice it with the pretty full-time role of being a physics professor?

20:00.960 --> 20:13.860
Well, I spend most of my time doing research and a lot of time teaching of course, and then I have maybe 10, 15% of my time left over for writing.

20:14.020 --> 20:23.560
It's not really left over because it's my weekends and evenings. How do I do it? Sometimes I wonder. The best answer is hurriedly.

20:24.200 --> 20:28.920
But in fact, I do work on my prose a great deal. I do many drafts and everything.

20:30.260 --> 20:34.280
I recently acquired a word processor to make this process simpler.

20:35.500 --> 20:41.440
But fundamentally, long ago I decided to practice time conservation wherever possible.

20:42.180 --> 20:45.760
The first rule of that is never do anything twice unless you enjoy it.

20:46.740 --> 20:58.300
So I try to never say, have to redraft simple things like NIMOs and always very selective about what I do with time.

20:58.880 --> 21:07.720
Other than that, I just have to say I draw a lot of my material that I write about from life, from observing people and so on.

21:08.220 --> 21:13.280
So I'm really doing two things at once. When I go to a scientific conference, I'm sopping up the material,

21:13.280 --> 21:20.120
but I'm also sopping up scientists watching the way people actually act.

21:20.740 --> 21:28.680
Every novelist does that. It's just that most novelists are full-time writers, and therefore they don't get out and see the real world very much.

21:29.160 --> 21:36.140
I think that's the great liability of being a professional writer who only does that, is that you run out of material.

21:36.140 --> 21:44.000
And I think the 20th century is full of writers whose big problem is that they ran out of material.

21:46.660 --> 21:51.400
Let me go back now and ask you the first question on the list since it looks like we have time.

21:52.140 --> 21:56.120
Give us a bit of background how you got into writing science fiction.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.500
Well, I was in graduate school in La Jolla in 1964.

22:01.500 --> 22:05.960
I was working very hard, and I really needed a break.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.080
But just going to the beach didn't seem to do it.

22:12.500 --> 22:19.000
So I began to write short stories. It was a pleasant thing you could do for an hour in the evening before you fell asleep.

22:20.500 --> 22:29.480
And I worked away at that, wrote some detective stories, which I never sold, then wrote some science fiction short stories, two or three, I think.

22:29.480 --> 22:34.380
The third one, I think, was the one I sold, the first one I sold.

22:36.180 --> 22:44.220
And I entered it, and specifically wrote it for a short story contest in the magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

22:44.620 --> 22:49.600
And it was one second place. And what did that make? Something like $100.

22:50.140 --> 22:54.180
And I got a lifetime subscription to the magazine, which has turned out to be worth quite a bit.

22:55.580 --> 22:59.680
So back there in 1965, I started out my career that way.

22:59.940 --> 23:05.800
I kept writing short stories as I did my doctorate and went off and became a postdoctoral fellow.

23:06.360 --> 23:09.200
And then began to think in terms of writing a novel.

23:09.460 --> 23:16.660
And it took me, I would say, really the better part of a decade to learn to write novels with anything approaching skill.

23:18.800 --> 23:25.680
It's a long haul. I've been writing now for what, 16 years? Or 17 years? Maybe more?

23:27.620 --> 23:32.020
And I wrote, in fact, when I was in high school. I wrote a few short stories and then gave it up.

23:32.880 --> 23:37.440
So I just had writing as a hobby all the way through my life.

23:39.940 --> 23:49.560
When you first joined the physics departments, how did your colleagues take it before you have tenure, when you're just green behind the ears, that sort of thing, knowing that you're a writer?

23:50.620 --> 23:55.380
Do they even know it or dig you about it or just don't care what?

23:57.180 --> 24:07.420
All of the above. Some of them just ignore it. Some of them think it's outright evidence that you're not doing it.

24:07.420 --> 24:13.380
You're really earnestly spending all of your time and 24 hours a day on your profession, which they more or less expect you to do.

24:13.920 --> 24:19.260
And a number of them think it's a good idea that you should have more than one suit in your hand.

24:22.500 --> 24:26.600
So it runs through the whole gamut of opinions.

24:27.340 --> 24:30.260
There are a lot of academics who think that writing is okay.

24:30.260 --> 24:37.840
And if I were writing little short stories for literary quarterlies, it would be perfectly okay and just fine.

24:38.380 --> 24:42.240
But if I actually write commercially, that's not so good.

24:42.420 --> 24:45.620
And to write commercially and be successful, that's even worse.

24:45.800 --> 24:50.320
And to write science fiction and be commercially successful is really pretty low.

24:51.040 --> 24:55.300
So there are a fair number of those people, but I just ignore them.

24:56.960 --> 25:01.580
They cannot be converted or can be educated, but they just be forgotten.

25:02.900 --> 25:08.580
Well, we noticed that you're now a full professor, so you really don't have to worry about that anymore.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.500
Well, that's true. I've never really worried about it anyway.

25:12.740 --> 25:24.780
I really don't give that much of a damn if people think about my writing in terms of if they evaluated on the basis of some kind of precedece status they wish to assign to.

25:25.300 --> 25:33.980
I think being an approved writer in this society is more of a sure sign that you're a secondary.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.360
That is the end of the list.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.960
And we sure appreciate it.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.480
I'm supposed to ask you one other question.

25:45.240 --> 25:48.120
Have you read James Hogan's Thrice Upon a Time?

25:55.280 --> 26:00.080
It's come out this year and we have a raging battle going on in our group about it.

26:00.300 --> 26:02.220
So we were going to ask you that.

26:02.340 --> 26:03.160
What's the battle about?

26:05.540 --> 26:10.540
Hogan writes, he's kind of an interminable lecturer in contrast.

26:11.220 --> 26:17.100
Now, this is me as opposed to writing characterizations.

26:17.860 --> 26:24.240
And so the battle is how do you really, how does one write and make it more fun?

26:24.240 --> 26:30.840
And I prefer the characterizations or the people prefer the golly gee science aspect of it.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.100
And he has a lot of that.

26:32.140 --> 26:33.700
That's what his is mainly that approach.

26:33.780 --> 26:38.620
He's invented a whole new realm of physics and in order to get the message.

26:39.500 --> 26:48.300
He uses a pretty clever little device where he hops from day to day through a computer back to the present to back to the past to tell them to alter it.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.820
And it gets altered and then other things happen.

26:50.820 --> 26:58.520
And it's quite enjoyable, but it's just an interesting comparison and contrast to your book.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.620
And so we just had to ask it.

27:00.660 --> 27:01.800
We wanted to ask it at the end.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.960
Yes, well, I really should read the book.

27:05.340 --> 27:07.520
I know exactly what kind of thing Hogan does.

27:08.000 --> 27:15.820
I elected, consciously elected a long time ago not to do that because I just don't think for me it's worth doing.

27:16.600 --> 27:20.640
It's very clever, but it's a mile wide and a millimeter deep.

27:21.320 --> 27:24.620
I'm not saying this specifically about his book because I haven't read it.

27:24.800 --> 27:29.980
It's just that that kind of writing is for me self-limiting.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.520
You will only reach a certain kind of audience with it.

27:32.940 --> 27:34.440
And it's not a bad audience.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.900
It's good audience, but it's very narrow.

27:38.120 --> 27:41.760
And also I find it boring to write that way.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.040
Just plain boring.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.720
I hate to give lectures.

27:46.660 --> 27:48.160
I can give lectures in person.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.580
Why should I give lectures in novels?

27:52.280 --> 27:56.040
What can we look for from you in the near future, in the far future?

27:58.600 --> 28:02.820
Well, I am finishing this week at the end of July.

28:03.520 --> 28:10.120
A novel I have provisionally titled Against Infinity, which is a very different kind of book with me.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.640
And I hope that will be out next year.

28:14.620 --> 28:20.860
After that I have the next volume in trilogy I'm writing, a very loosely connected trilogy.

28:21.640 --> 28:27.900
The first volume of it was A Novel Called in the Ocean of Night, which I think is the second best book I've written after Times Square.

28:28.880 --> 28:32.200
And the sequel to that is called Across the Sea of Suns.

28:32.200 --> 28:40.040
I have a good draft of that done, and I hope that the next half year or so to finish off the draft of that.

28:40.420 --> 28:43.040
And then to get on to the book that goes beyond that.

28:43.540 --> 28:47.960
And then after that I have a book which is some way similar to Times Square.

28:49.080 --> 28:54.740
And it's a general approach to things, but it's not about time in mind.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.560
And I hope to write that, but I know that that will take a number of years.

28:58.560 --> 29:02.140
So that's all I can plan on.

29:05.180 --> 29:06.780
Any other questions guys?

29:08.420 --> 29:14.980
Actually, it has been pretty popular for an effort to participate in.

29:15.540 --> 29:18.780
Oh, any inquiries about movies on Times Square?

29:19.920 --> 29:21.600
Yes, there have been a number.

29:22.720 --> 29:35.180
Hollywood has been in terrible shape this last year, and there was a cost out done on Times Square which said it would cost more than $20 million, I think $22 million in price to shoot.

29:35.760 --> 29:39.560
And of course they were not able to get up that amount of money, but it's still out.

29:39.700 --> 29:42.060
I think CBS is looking at it right now.

29:43.420 --> 29:46.160
Who knows? It would be possible to shoot it.

29:49.320 --> 29:53.600
But Lord knows about Hollywood as always.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.140
Anything else guys?

30:00.080 --> 30:02.600
Okay, we certainly appreciate it.

30:03.300 --> 30:08.360
And as a fan, thanks very much for slipping in tomorrow into a book. I didn't ever think it would be possible.

30:09.120 --> 30:12.200
Great, sure. Anything else you want to slip in? I'm not sure.

30:15.040 --> 30:24.280
Well, I've talked to these guys. I think I'm a chemist and I think chemistry is definitely the worst treated of all the physical sciences in science fiction.

30:24.420 --> 30:26.260
I think people don't do a very good job of that.

30:26.920 --> 30:32.660
The physics and astronomy and the biology, great. The soft science is great. Chemistry kind of gets screwed, I think.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.140
I think so. There are not many chemistry stars.

30:35.620 --> 30:39.220
That's right. But actually it is kind of a boring subject to most people.

30:39.220 --> 30:42.500
How clean is chemistry?

30:43.820 --> 30:47.600
Yeah, this is true with the atmospheres and so forth.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.700
Sure. The nitrogen fix? Yeah, sure. Okay, how could I forget?

30:54.620 --> 30:57.540
Okay, we appreciate your taking the time to talk to us.

30:57.980 --> 31:04.280
And again, we'll get back to you and perhaps do another one. One of these days when your other books come out, we look forward to them.

31:04.280 --> 31:11.960
Fine, I appreciate the opportunity. It's really nice to be able to speak specifically to an SF audience.

31:12.540 --> 31:13.580
Seldom gets the chance.

31:15.220 --> 31:17.380
Okay, thanks again. We'll talk to you later then.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.800
Thank you. Bye-bye then.
