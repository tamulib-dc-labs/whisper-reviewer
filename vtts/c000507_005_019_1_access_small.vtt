00:01.620 --> 00:06.200
I'm sure you've been asked before and I probably know the answers to them myself, but maybe

00:06.200 --> 00:10.300
a lot of the listeners in the radio show won't, so you know, just put up with that I guess.

00:10.420 --> 00:11.260
Oh, sure, yeah.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.420
I'm well used to that.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.100
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:13.660 --> 00:14.920
Tell me your front name again.

00:15.320 --> 00:15.640
Darrell.

00:16.060 --> 00:16.460
Darrell.

00:16.720 --> 00:17.380
Yeah, Darrell.

00:17.580 --> 00:17.980
Okay.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.760
I'm an English teacher here at Odessa College.

00:20.240 --> 00:20.580
Right.

00:21.420 --> 00:27.620
Okay, listen, you obviously had an extremely varied background and I wondered if you could

00:27.620 --> 00:30.200
just say a few words about how you began as a writer.

00:31.360 --> 00:31.840
Okay.

00:33.780 --> 00:41.560
I began to write when I was an able seaman in the Virgin Mary and how that came about

00:41.560 --> 00:44.820
was that I left college before I graduated from high school.

00:45.660 --> 00:46.840
It's a fascinating thing.

00:47.040 --> 00:52.080
I lectured at colleges and universities all over the United States and in England and in

00:52.080 --> 00:56.120
France and I have yet to get my high school diploma.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.780
Someday, somebody will grant me an honorary high school diploma.

01:01.300 --> 01:06.880
But anyway, I was on the ship and you had a lot of time to read and I conceived the idea

01:06.880 --> 01:11.160
of an absolutely foolproof crime that would net me thousands and thousands of dollars.

01:11.740 --> 01:13.300
And I even did research on it.

01:13.500 --> 01:20.320
And as I was on the coast wise tanker and as I was going up and down the coast, when

01:20.320 --> 01:24.360
we stopped at a port, I would send off a letter to the railroad so it was one of those things

01:24.360 --> 01:28.100
that was involved and the insurance companies, that was another in the post office that was

01:28.100 --> 01:28.440
selling out.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.980
I got all my research done as to how to commit this particular kind of robbery.

01:34.560 --> 01:39.220
And they let it carefully written so that nobody would know what I was up to.

01:40.580 --> 01:45.720
And when I had all my material, I found that I did not have the immoral courage to commit

01:45.720 --> 01:46.260
the crime.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.180
So I wrote it as a story.

01:49.460 --> 01:51.760
This was way back in the late 30s.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.000
And I sent my story off to a newspaper syndicate.

01:57.620 --> 02:04.200
I did not know anything about writing particularly and they were buying 1500 word short stories

02:04.200 --> 02:06.540
that they published every day in the syndicate.

02:07.900 --> 02:12.560
And when I got up to New York in the ship, to my amazement, I got a letter of acceptance.

02:13.820 --> 02:17.480
And so I quit the sea and came ashore to be a writer.

02:18.860 --> 02:25.760
And I got my money not on acceptance but on publication and it was five whole dollars.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.020
And they would buy one and sometimes two stories a week but no more.

02:31.620 --> 02:35.620
And so four and a half months or so, I lived on five and sometimes ten dollars a week.

02:36.280 --> 02:40.520
My room cost me seven and whatever I saved I could eat.

02:40.940 --> 02:45.180
And I learned a lot about being hungry and how to...

02:45.180 --> 02:48.620
Did you ever notice that the counter cake has no crust on the end?

02:50.980 --> 02:54.640
What they do is chop them off and they sell them in their day old store.

02:55.380 --> 02:58.660
And at that time you could get a whole shopping bag full of cake ends for a nickel.

02:59.660 --> 03:01.460
And I used to live on that.

03:01.640 --> 03:06.420
One time I got a whole shopping bag full and it was moldy but I ate it anyhow and I was

03:06.420 --> 03:09.300
so sick I didn't eat for three days and so I saved myself some money.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.120
You know, I was like that.

03:11.700 --> 03:12.700
It was a hard school.

03:13.060 --> 03:13.640
It really was.

03:13.640 --> 03:13.780
It was hard.

03:15.900 --> 03:23.180
But then I finally, after some months of that, and I think I went back to sea for a short

03:23.180 --> 03:29.620
while, I finally met John Campbell in 1939, early 1939.

03:30.540 --> 03:36.100
He was the editor of astounding science fiction and a wonderful fantasy magazine called Unknown.

03:38.040 --> 03:42.520
And so I started writing for him and then after that it just exploded.

03:43.420 --> 03:47.460
One time I had four stories on the stands at the same time and those two magazines I

03:47.460 --> 03:49.720
had to get two new names.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.220
So it was an interesting beginning.

03:57.080 --> 03:57.940
Okay, excellent.

03:59.400 --> 04:03.160
Now you've done a lot of writing for the pulp but I don't think anybody would categorize

04:03.160 --> 04:04.020
you as a pulp writer.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.640
Well, you know, this is difficult with a, this is difficult with a whole matter of

04:09.140 --> 04:09.980
categorization anyway.

04:10.960 --> 04:17.700
We're in the grip of the taxonomist and people who put labels on things and stick them into

04:17.700 --> 04:18.220
cubby holes.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.120
Taxonomy has its uses.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.560
There's no question about that.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.260
You have to be able to find and retrieve information and that's what taxonomy is all about.

04:27.840 --> 04:32.220
But more and more there seems to come over our whole culture.

04:32.220 --> 04:37.320
The idea that if you can put a label on it you understand it and that is not what taxonomy

04:37.320 --> 04:37.840
is for.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.480
Taxonomy is handles by which you can pick something up and look at it.

04:42.220 --> 04:47.640
But for so many people in so many ways the label is sufficient.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.380
You know, he's a Republican.

04:49.860 --> 04:57.200
He's whether with a Q or yeah, he's a poet, he's an S-beach or whatever.

04:57.200 --> 05:02.940
They're all labels and just a little effort made to understand what's under these labels.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.160
Pulp fiction has suffered from the same thing.

05:06.980 --> 05:10.880
Pulp actually referred to the kind of paper it was printed on, not to its quality.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.540
There was the pulps and there were the slicks.

05:13.680 --> 05:18.540
The slicks from magazines like this Saturday evening, Post and Collier's and the home journal.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.940
And the pulps were things like black masks and air war stories and science fiction and

05:23.940 --> 05:24.700
fantasy and the like.

05:26.080 --> 05:31.300
But it's so easy for the taxonomists and for people who don't pay proper attention to what

05:31.300 --> 05:37.840
was going on to feel that pulp was a qualitative comment and slick was also qualitative.

05:38.020 --> 05:40.600
Slicked paper was better literature than pulp paper.

05:42.140 --> 05:47.000
Some of the finest writing around is some of the best pulp writers as such.

05:47.260 --> 05:52.320
I mean the best writers of the time began in pulp and they only gravitated to the slicks

05:52.320 --> 05:54.680
not because they got better but because they got paid more.

05:56.340 --> 05:58.520
Red Ratbury is a perfect example of that.

06:00.020 --> 06:03.180
There was Dashiell Hammett and the like.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.220
Why do you think that you never became more...

06:10.220 --> 06:13.560
I know you've written mainstream fiction, I know you don't like categories either, but

06:13.960 --> 06:17.760
I wondered why you're mainly noted a lot of your writing in science fiction fantasy rather

06:17.760 --> 06:18.340
than mainstream.

06:18.780 --> 06:24.780
Well, first of all because I love the field because it's the only genre which has no limitations

06:24.780 --> 06:25.140
whatsoever.

06:26.140 --> 06:28.800
A lot of people there, the taxonomists are into it again.

06:29.320 --> 06:34.460
They feel that science fiction is the literature of the future and of space, which is nonsense.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.440
It's true that a lot of it is, but you can write science fiction about the past.

06:38.660 --> 06:43.360
You can write science fiction about that marvelous place called other, just some other place that

06:43.360 --> 06:46.020
doesn't have any reference to where we go in the future.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.300
That's the best kind, that's the kind that I think one of the things that science fiction

06:51.300 --> 06:51.800
is for.

06:52.260 --> 06:55.440
If you don't like the government, go ahead and create a new kind of government.

06:55.560 --> 06:56.880
Give it a push and see how it works.

06:58.300 --> 07:04.080
You can study whole cultures and religions and also literature and art.

07:04.980 --> 07:08.940
I've gone into that in some of my stories, which are essentially in places that occur

07:08.940 --> 07:12.500
just other, not in the future or in the past necessarily.

07:12.500 --> 07:18.180
One of the very finest science fiction books around is by somebody I'm very proud to call

07:18.180 --> 07:19.320
one of my ex-students.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.440
It's called Wild Seed.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.160
It's by Octavia Butler.

07:24.100 --> 07:30.560
It begins somewhere around the 17th century and goes up to about 1910, which is highly

07:30.560 --> 07:31.380
future fiction.

07:32.300 --> 07:38.460
It's a totally original structure, original idea and beautifully, beautifully written.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.160
That lady is tremendous.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.160
She really is.

07:42.580 --> 07:43.260
One of the big ones.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.840
Yeah, I know that book.

07:44.960 --> 07:45.660
She is very good.

07:45.880 --> 07:46.140
Yeah.

07:47.140 --> 07:53.140
Listen, in the late 30s and through the 40s, did you have any contact with other science

07:53.140 --> 07:53.780
fiction writers?

07:53.940 --> 07:56.880
Was there any sense of community or groupings or anything like that?

07:57.060 --> 07:57.600
Oh, sure.

07:58.640 --> 08:03.080
I am characteristically not a joiner as such.

08:03.580 --> 08:06.960
There was a group called the Hydro Club, which was completely informal.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.960
The rule one was that there are no rules for this organization.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.460
An awful lot of people belong to the Hydro Club.

08:16.560 --> 08:21.120
Through that in the early years, I got to know all sorts of people like Harz Gold and

08:21.120 --> 08:25.920
Fred Pol and Henry Kutner and so on.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.320
Well, the whole raft with those early writers, I think I knew them all.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.660
And there was a group there, Fred Pol was written about.

08:35.780 --> 08:36.940
They were called the Puterians.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.180
I was never involved in that particularly.

08:40.100 --> 08:45.440
I attended the very first Milford Science Fiction Writers Conference in Milford, New

08:45.440 --> 08:45.740
Jersey.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.380
I guess that was in 1951.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.620
And Judith Merrill, I was very close to.

08:53.220 --> 08:59.020
Well, I knew virtually everybody in the field at that time except one or two of the West

08:59.020 --> 08:59.720
Coast people.

09:02.660 --> 09:05.400
Okay, one sort of general question on your style.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.820
You, you, many of your stories have different kinds of style.

09:11.900 --> 09:15.240
And I wonder if you experiment deliberately or is it something that comes naturally to

09:15.240 --> 09:15.360
you?

09:15.420 --> 09:16.520
It's absolutely deliberate.

09:17.100 --> 09:21.400
The creation of a style, you can go a long way in the literary business.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.380
Steinbett did it all this time.

09:24.380 --> 09:24.980
And I'm not sure if you've ever actually did it.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.840
One of the stunning examples is Ray Bradbury.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.960
But you develop a style and then you stick to it.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.680
Pretty soon you become imitable.

09:35.080 --> 09:40.760
That is to say, anybody with any real facility with words can sit down and write a pure paragraph

09:40.760 --> 09:41.620
of Steinbett.

09:42.620 --> 09:44.980
Or for that matter Hemingway.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.660
To imitate Hemingway and Steinbett is very, very easy.

09:48.660 --> 09:53.840
And Bradbury particularly is extremely easy to imitate.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.640
But you don't imitate Samuel Delaney, for example.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.400
You don't imitate, I mean, not by the paragraph.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.480
I'm not saying that you can sit down and write a Bradbury story or a Hemingway story.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.380
That's a different matter.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.800
But you were talking just about the matter of style.

10:10.900 --> 10:15.960
And yes, it's a very conscious effort on my part to be able to write with facility in

10:15.960 --> 10:18.040
any of a number of styles.

10:19.280 --> 10:24.500
And sometimes the first person's stories, and I write out of the mouth of the person who's talking.

10:25.460 --> 10:28.820
And not everybody talks in a high literary style.

10:28.980 --> 10:31.300
That's what I fought Aldous Huxley for mostly.

10:32.140 --> 10:36.480
You read an Aldous Huxley novel and Aldous Huxley talks like Aldous Huxley.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.280
And old men talk like Aldous Huxley.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.180
And little girls talk like Aldous Huxley.

10:41.820 --> 10:43.720
It's a monotone.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.140
All the words come out of all the mouths with the same kind of cadence.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.860
And I don't consider this really top writing.

10:52.600 --> 10:58.120
Why I admire Delaney so much is that when he talks ghetto black, it is for real.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.820
But if he has two characters discussing modern American poetry,

11:02.640 --> 11:07.600
they talk in the terms of William Carlos Williams or T.S. Eliot.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.060
And he knows, he's got a good ear.

11:11.060 --> 11:13.720
He knows the cadence of this kind of writing.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.420
And I admire that so very much.

11:16.580 --> 11:17.440
That you can't imitate.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.060
And so I consciously do that.

11:24.440 --> 11:29.320
Okay. James Gunn has written that because of Sturge and other writers have been free

11:29.320 --> 11:32.460
or to write what they wish to write and able to find a market for it.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.640
And I wondered if you were conscious of yourself as having that kind of a role?

11:35.920 --> 11:37.440
Not at all. Not at all.

11:38.340 --> 11:42.560
I tell you, the last few years have been real revelations to me.

11:44.920 --> 11:49.360
For one thing, I didn't realize that I had had so much personal impact on people.

11:50.740 --> 11:52.840
Until what was it, six years or so?

11:53.420 --> 11:58.020
Now, I went to Italy and a woman came up to me dragging an interpreter.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.740
And the interpreter said, she doesn't speak any English,

12:00.860 --> 12:02.520
but there are two things that she wants to tell you.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.840
One of them is that you write women better than any writer she knows.

12:06.680 --> 12:10.600
And the other thing is that because of something that you wrote,

12:11.140 --> 12:12.800
she did not kill herself one night.

12:13.540 --> 12:17.200
And the woman began to cry and the interpreter began to cry and I began to cry.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.300
And it was quite an experience.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.980
I suddenly realized that what I have done, apparently,

12:26.080 --> 12:31.260
I've been able to reach a great many people far deeper than I had any idea that I was doing.

12:31.260 --> 12:34.360
When I look back over the mail that I've gotten over the years,

12:35.640 --> 12:40.660
I realize how many people in how many different ways have told me that same kind of thing.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.760
It's extremely gratifying. It's also a little frightening.

12:44.480 --> 12:50.520
I mean, it's frightening enough to make you terrified or touching your typewriter.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.600
What's his name?

12:58.740 --> 12:59.620
Not Lafferty.

13:01.420 --> 13:04.120
I'm sorry, I have to stop a minute and think about Barry Malzburg.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.920
Wrote a fascinating book called Engines of the Night.

13:08.060 --> 13:11.920
And I have a quote from it here that somebody's ear rocks for me and sent to me.

13:13.780 --> 13:19.000
And he said, the most important science fiction writer of the 40s was probably Theodore Sturgeon.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.280
He said he was not the best or the most significant,

13:22.400 --> 13:27.240
nor did he make the most fundamental impression, even as a stylist, the basis of his reputation.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.400
He might have fallen behind a cuteness in top form,

13:30.460 --> 13:36.660
but what Sturgeon did was to keep open the possibility for a kind of science fiction that eventually many others came to, too.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.500
Which in itself is very gratifying.

13:41.100 --> 13:46.340
He says Sturgeon's contribution was unique in his use of style, internalization and quirky characterization.

13:46.340 --> 13:50.120
He was keeping the door open for everything that happened after 1950,

13:50.700 --> 13:54.940
when the gold voucher in the 50s perspective became the alternative that dominated the field.

13:55.640 --> 13:59.660
If he had not been around for this decade to hold the flags of this kind of science fiction,

14:00.140 --> 14:02.960
had not established that the literature could be style-oriented,

14:03.420 --> 14:06.380
it is possible that the 50s perspective would not have developed.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.620
The editors and potential audience might have been there,

14:09.800 --> 14:14.120
but no basis would have been existed upon which writers within the field could build.

14:14.780 --> 14:19.080
It's so gratifying to read a thing like that, you know, years after the fact.

14:20.940 --> 14:26.180
Maltsberg never told me that he was writing that in an essay, and I came on it quite by accident.

14:27.460 --> 14:33.240
But apparently that was the case, and I'll tell you quickly a story.

14:34.080 --> 14:39.960
A few years ago, there was a little boy who went to see his buddy, he was six or seven years old.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.520
His mother told him back to me back before dark.

14:42.980 --> 14:46.840
And he was so busy playing with his friend that he looked out the window and saw it was dark.

14:47.180 --> 14:53.200
And he went rushing home, and like little kids will, he dragged his stick along a picket fence,

14:53.320 --> 14:55.940
and when he got to the corner, he whined it against the lamppost.

14:56.500 --> 15:00.000
And immediately all the lights in the northeastern United States went out.

15:00.220 --> 15:01.980
Remember that one, that big blackout?

15:03.340 --> 15:06.960
He went rushing home to his mother, weeping, and threw himself into her arms,

15:07.260 --> 15:10.280
and said, God, mommy, I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it.

15:10.780 --> 15:14.420
Well, this is the way I felt when I first read things like this.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.620
Very gratifying, and very surprising to me.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.340
You know, I did not do that on purpose.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.580
I was like, God, mommy, I didn't mean it.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.180
Yeah, a lot of critics that I've read feel that same way.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.840
That's pretty universal opinion.

15:28.480 --> 15:37.500
In relation to that, a number of critics and authors also identify you as sort of a shatterer of taboos,

15:37.500 --> 15:41.060
some of the themes that you wrote about just hadn't been handled in science fiction before.

15:41.380 --> 15:43.560
Yeah, that's right. That I've done on purpose.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.860
You can stand by for a coffee.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.240
Coffee's over.

15:52.820 --> 15:58.740
Yes, I have purposely broken taboos, and you know, I wrote the first stories in science fiction

16:00.700 --> 16:05.060
about homosexuality, for example, which dealt with homosexuality, and with incest.

16:05.060 --> 16:09.920
And I had a three-prider in omnilist last year, which dealt with cannibalism.

16:10.900 --> 16:15.940
But these stories were not about homosexuality, and about incest, and about cannibalism.

16:16.020 --> 16:17.580
Essentially, they were about confrontation.

16:18.800 --> 16:23.660
All my life I've been infuriated by people who shuck away from an idea.

16:23.820 --> 16:24.680
I don't want to hear about that.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.660
Oh, don't tell me that. I don't want to hear it.

16:27.180 --> 16:28.600
You know, oh, it angers me.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.100
Because only by confrontation can we really learn anything.

16:33.020 --> 16:37.840
The whole history of, well, a subject like masturbation, for example,

16:38.780 --> 16:42.180
which absolutely terrified the three or four generations before mine,

16:42.620 --> 16:44.040
and preoccupied them too.

16:45.320 --> 16:52.220
The inventor of one of our more famous breakfast foods, he was a nutritional doctor,

16:52.840 --> 16:57.520
and he used to write dietary and medical advice books for the home.

16:57.520 --> 17:01.240
And about 75% of them has to do with masturbation,

17:01.540 --> 17:05.480
and how it will make your hair fall out and give you a softening of the brain

17:05.480 --> 17:08.280
and tuberculosis and cancer and all kinds of things.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.000
Nowadays, with a little confrontation and a little research and study,

17:14.720 --> 17:20.060
you can read in the highest level of women's magazines

17:20.540 --> 17:22.540
not only how to do it, but how to do it well.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.080
And it's become a totally accepted practice.

17:27.980 --> 17:31.780
But the horror that went on, because people would not confront it,

17:31.860 --> 17:36.320
or would not find out what the truth was, caused so much frightful damage.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.300
I mean, people committed suicide over that.

17:39.420 --> 17:49.880
I had a relative whose whole life was absolutely made ill by history and occupation with that.

17:51.180 --> 17:56.060
To be tempted and finitely healed, and then feel guilty and feel guilty,

17:56.240 --> 17:59.560
and so guilty that he would never tell anybody about it.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.780
It'd wrecked his whole life.

18:01.400 --> 18:07.060
That was a lot of years ago, in the past generation, but it's an example of what I mean.

18:07.660 --> 18:08.780
Now, people have got to confront.

18:11.140 --> 18:14.180
If we meet, you'll probably see me wearing a little silver medallion.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.940
It's a letter to it without an arrow through it.

18:17.020 --> 18:18.040
It's my trademark.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.540
And what it means is, ask the next question.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.360
To me, it's the symbol of everything that humanity has ever created.

18:27.080 --> 18:31.380
And it's the only way it has been created by people asking the next question, the one that follows.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.380
And so often people ask the next question, the one that follows, and the one that follows,

18:36.480 --> 18:40.820
until they suddenly come to a question, they don't want to ask because they're afraid they might get the answer.

18:41.660 --> 18:42.460
And there they stop.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.920
And then when you stop asking the next question, you die.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.140
You become a zombie.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.540
And join the ranks of the zombies you see marching around you.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.940
Where I've stopped asking the next question.

18:53.160 --> 18:59.920
It's a very symbol of life and of progress and of science and everything toward basic truth.

19:00.620 --> 19:06.160
When you ever reach basic truth, you'll find not a thing or a precept, but you'll find a process.

19:06.340 --> 19:07.620
You'll find something going on.

19:09.340 --> 19:12.120
And this is the way I've been thinking, apparently, all my life.

19:12.120 --> 19:18.060
I get very, very irritated when I find that people refuse to think beyond a certain point.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.600
There's a bumper sticker that goes around in the Bible Belt.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.960
God said it. I believe it. That settled it.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.740
When you see a bumper sticker like that, you just hear the crash of a closing mind.

19:31.240 --> 19:35.060
There's plenty of room out there to confront the whole idea of God and to go on with it.

19:35.380 --> 19:40.560
And ask the next question and the question that follows without committing any particular kind of sin.

19:40.560 --> 19:44.040
Excellent. That's very good.

19:44.260 --> 19:48.320
I'm in the middle of the Bible Belt out here in Odessa. I know exactly what you mean, those kind of people.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.660
Isn't that a great bumper sticker?

19:51.240 --> 19:51.640
Yeah.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.980
God said it. I believe it. That's settled it.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.320
Yeah, okay.

19:57.440 --> 20:01.020
Let me ask a couple questions about some of your particular works.

20:02.440 --> 20:09.980
The book Venus Plus X, which I guess was published in 1960, I suppose the impetus behind that was the sexual stereotyping in our society.

20:09.980 --> 20:14.020
Because that's right. That came about by her's leafy through a magazine.

20:14.560 --> 20:19.600
And I saw an ad for a whole thing's tire chain. Weed tire chains.

20:20.500 --> 20:25.920
And there was a photograph of a girl in her underwear holding on a tire chain.

20:27.080 --> 20:31.240
And it stopped me cold. I said, what on earth has that got to do with a tire chain?

20:32.640 --> 20:38.920
Clearly, you know, it was a grabber by the advertising business that made me stop and look at the ad.

20:38.920 --> 20:43.100
But what has to go with the clothes I've got to do with a tire chain?

20:43.880 --> 20:46.500
And I began to think, what kind of a civilization?

20:47.380 --> 20:51.720
What would it be like to live in a culture where there's no particular sexual bias at all?

20:52.480 --> 20:59.060
And so I started, first of all, creating a society in which there was no sexual at all.

21:00.140 --> 21:05.340
That people were, they generated like oysters, which can be both either male or female.

21:05.340 --> 21:10.340
But at the beginning, they're neither. And I couldn't make that work.

21:11.220 --> 21:15.400
So I went in another direction and created a race of people.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.200
And each individual was both sexes.

21:20.760 --> 21:24.460
And therefore there was no sexual differentiation. They were just people.

21:25.520 --> 21:33.080
And it got into their love and marriage, their sexuality, also into their art, their literature, their architecture.

21:34.580 --> 21:36.320
And so, and I had a ball with that.

21:36.940 --> 21:40.720
Venus plus sex is not really a novel at all. It's a tract.

21:41.740 --> 21:44.540
It's an exposition of the ideas that I was getting at the time.

21:46.620 --> 21:50.300
Yeah, you wouldn't necessarily advocate the kind of surgical alteration in that book.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.300
No, by no means.

21:53.700 --> 21:58.140
I have to be careful of that. When an author comes out with a rather radical notion,

21:59.840 --> 22:02.420
it's very easy to assume that he's promoting that.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.840
Heinlein, for example, got a lot of rocks thrown at him for Starship Cooper,

22:08.620 --> 22:12.060
because they felt that that was particularly the kind of military he advocates.

22:12.400 --> 22:17.180
It's not, not really. He has a military background. It's perfectly true.

22:17.480 --> 22:24.860
Which made his description of the Starship Cooper seem very real, and that he was promoting it.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.940
He also has a reputation for being a male chauvinist pig.

22:30.140 --> 22:34.420
However, I know the man extremely well. I know that that could be the least occasion.

22:34.640 --> 22:39.220
He's the only married man I've ever seen who always rises to his feet when his wife comes into the room.

22:40.720 --> 22:48.220
In the Notebooks of Lazarus Long, there are several items similar to Page Long and so only a paragraph or a sentence.

22:48.220 --> 22:55.040
But the very shortest one in the Notebooks of Lazarus Long could not possibly have been written by a male chauvinist pig.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.520
In order to rub her feet.

23:03.540 --> 23:11.720
Okay. Would you say that more than human is probably your best known work? Is that the one you get the most response?

23:11.720 --> 23:20.380
I would say so. And when I sold Finnish and Israeli rights two years ago, it got into its 15th and 16th languages.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.340
And just how many editions? I have no idea. Genuinely not.

23:25.160 --> 23:31.900
I know there are five or six English editions and several Spanish and a number of French and four Japanese editions.

23:31.900 --> 23:43.300
I think I'm proud of all of that. If a novel can pass the language barrier and the cultural barrier and go into more editions, then I think that's a real achievement.

23:44.960 --> 23:53.500
The French now have film rights and it's in the works now to be a film finally after all these years.

23:54.800 --> 24:04.060
We had a really superb director, but through various machinations he has dropped out so I don't know exactly who is going to direct it at this point.

24:04.820 --> 24:12.860
The script is written by me and by Jane Tannehill, my lady Jane, my wife, who is a superb script writer.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.680
Well, she's a very loaded lady. She really is. Tremendous person.

24:18.680 --> 24:26.760
She is at the moment down at the metaphysical center where she's running a seminar on the tarot.

24:27.660 --> 24:32.280
She will be ordained a minister in the American Holistic Church next July.

24:33.440 --> 24:39.800
She completed all last season with the San Diego Symphony Orchestra and the master chorale.

24:39.940 --> 24:46.180
She's a chorale singer and a composer and a musician and a born teacher.

24:46.180 --> 24:52.060
She's also an established science fiction writer. She's an old analog and amazing and chrysalis.

24:52.700 --> 24:59.060
As I say, a very, very accomplished person. As a script writer, she's really splendid.

24:59.320 --> 25:05.740
It was a joy to work with her and I don't work easily with other people, but we wrote a very fine script for more than human.

25:06.740 --> 25:10.760
I suspect there will be more coming up of that, or collaborating on screenplays.

25:12.020 --> 25:15.080
That's good. I'm happy to hear that about the movie.

25:15.660 --> 25:20.360
Of course, I guess that was the original story there was in Baby Makes Three.

25:20.920 --> 25:26.220
I wonder why it made you... What made you add the other two to that?

25:28.040 --> 25:33.560
The springboard for that was in a book by Pearl Buck, which was called The Vision of Women.

25:33.780 --> 25:36.420
I read it so many years ago that I hardly remember the book at all.

25:37.120 --> 25:43.360
But there was one passage in there which described a monk who took care of some children in a cave in the woods.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.680
They were uneducated and wild children that had died without him.

25:48.460 --> 25:53.320
He was just an impoverished monk himself, and he took care of these raggedy little children.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.420
That image always stayed with me.

25:57.400 --> 26:04.720
Somehow that and the whole idea of what would happen if each of these children, coming from various places

26:04.720 --> 26:11.060
and being various kinds of children, had very special ESP talents.

26:12.660 --> 26:18.500
Again, it was a question of investigating what the impact would be on the world as a whole,

26:20.420 --> 26:25.860
as some of the newly recognized propitivities of the human mind came up.

26:27.180 --> 26:31.440
This, of course, is... There are literally thousands of books that have been written on that theme since then.

26:33.220 --> 26:40.240
Of course, the people in that book is in so many of your other stories and novels, I think, are sort of misfits.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.620
I wondered why you picked that kind of character so often.

26:43.260 --> 26:46.040
Well, I think a misfit has a chance to be objective.

26:47.500 --> 26:55.040
For one thing, he sees society as a whole from its underbelly or from way off at one side.

26:57.620 --> 26:59.360
Essentially, it's not so much misfits.

27:00.180 --> 27:02.340
The key to what I write, I think, is loneliness.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.600
I learned early that you can write about excitement, you can write about adventure, you can write love and sex and so on.

27:11.780 --> 27:19.440
And basically, in each case, you don't hit too many people, but if you write about loneliness, everybody's an expert.

27:21.120 --> 27:27.060
I'm fond of saying that if you know some guy who collects pheasant feathers, and that's his whole preoccupation,

27:27.800 --> 27:32.140
and you write a story that involves pheasant feathers, and you know what you're talking about, he's going to love it.

27:32.780 --> 27:37.460
But the incidence of people in the general population who collect pheasant feathers is very small.

27:39.000 --> 27:45.800
But the point is that because you wrote to an expert of an expertise, you see, you grab him.

27:46.400 --> 27:51.220
Now, what are people as a whole mostly expert at loneliness?

27:53.040 --> 27:55.300
The world is full of experts on loneliness.

27:55.620 --> 27:58.740
It's something that everybody recognizes when he sees it.

27:58.840 --> 28:03.460
So it's not so much that these people are misfits, it's that they're lonely.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.200
And I think that that's the hope that I can throw into people the hardest.

28:09.220 --> 28:15.720
But then on the other hand, a number of your stories, too, give the solution to that is some sort of love.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.180
Uh-huh. That's right.

28:18.340 --> 28:22.520
I would have said that love is probably the principal theme I find through all your work.

28:22.940 --> 28:25.280
That's right. And isn't it the antithesis of loneliness?

28:26.340 --> 28:29.720
I mean, it's the yin and the yang. It's the balancing principle to loneliness.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.340
And the cure for loneliness is love.

28:34.960 --> 28:41.280
Individual to individual, or individual in his relationship to the entire world.

28:43.100 --> 28:47.780
Yeah, I would have said love in all its meanings, not necessarily individuals, but in all of its...

28:47.780 --> 28:48.320
That's right.

28:51.320 --> 28:54.240
Okay, one more brief question on that more than human book.

28:55.180 --> 28:58.180
Do you think that we do have latent to ESP or PSY powers?

28:58.380 --> 29:01.680
There's no question about it. I've always felt so.

29:02.240 --> 29:07.280
And particularly so in the seven years I've been married to Jane because Jane is a psychic.

29:07.280 --> 29:11.840
And she's now involved in the Metaphysical Center here in San Diego.

29:12.760 --> 29:21.420
And she's learning and teaching both these whole courses on the alternative metaphysical subjects.

29:22.300 --> 29:28.860
Rather than that, my recently attended a fascinating seminar at the Aslan Institute up on the coast here.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.720
Oh, Lord, what a beautiful place that is.

29:31.880 --> 29:37.320
The seminar was run by Dr. Lily, John Lily.

29:37.660 --> 29:39.880
You've heard of him in connection with dolphins and the like.

29:40.720 --> 29:45.500
And I'm at Goswami, who's a theoretical physicist from the University of Oregon.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.860
And Arthur Young, who's a...

29:48.860 --> 29:51.960
He's the man who invented the helicopter and so on.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.080
And the general thrust of the thing was quantum mechanics.

29:55.740 --> 29:59.280
And when quantum mechanics gets up into its higher level,

29:59.280 --> 30:02.560
it approaches philosophy, metaphysics, and religion.

30:03.060 --> 30:04.400
There's no question about it.

30:04.860 --> 30:12.980
But it also deals with the potentialities of the human mind and of ESP and so on.

30:13.400 --> 30:20.820
And we ran some experiments during that seminar on precognition and telepathy and so on.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.800
There's rather breathtaking results.

30:23.940 --> 30:27.900
You'll find quantum mechanics people generally.

30:27.900 --> 30:34.020
If you go into the book section, which has to do with philosophy and quantum mechanics,

30:34.580 --> 30:42.400
you'll find this melding coming along between these higher levels of science and philosophy.

30:43.540 --> 30:49.980
And it always includes something about the untapped possibilities of the human mind.

30:50.620 --> 30:53.040
This is a thesis to be totally fantastic anymore.

30:55.240 --> 31:01.980
The psychic possibilities, so-called supernatural, is one of the better documented things.

31:02.180 --> 31:04.960
There are documents going back 2,000 years which deal with it.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.420
And we've all experienced it.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.680
Sometimes we don't notice our own experiences, but we do.

31:12.500 --> 31:18.360
And investigations of such things has passed lives and so on.

31:18.820 --> 31:20.160
It's fascinating to get into.

31:20.800 --> 31:23.200
You don't have to believe everything about it.

31:23.520 --> 31:27.900
You can take a perfectly scientific attitude and simply sit around gathering data.

31:28.880 --> 31:33.360
The thing is, you could gather the data you don't like as well as the data that you do like.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.440
There's a paradigm there with flying saucers.

31:39.580 --> 31:40.400
Excuse me.

31:42.040 --> 31:46.720
Where people ask questions in the convention, do you believe in flying saucers?

31:46.720 --> 31:49.560
Well, do I believe in unidentified flying objects?

31:49.820 --> 31:49.900
Yeah.

31:50.860 --> 31:56.280
And anybody with any observation has seen flying objects which he couldn't identify.

31:56.980 --> 32:01.220
Do I believe they come from a certain planet or have people in there who have come to Earth

32:01.220 --> 32:05.060
to straighten us out for our old problems because we can't sell them ourselves?

32:05.360 --> 32:05.740
And so on.

32:05.760 --> 32:06.700
No, I don't believe that.

32:07.560 --> 32:13.000
I would sit and gather data to like a hardware and body so I can really know, you know,

32:13.340 --> 32:15.380
precisely and exactly what these things are.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.500
So I make no assumptions.

32:17.700 --> 32:18.640
I just gather data.

32:19.180 --> 32:26.640
But if something comes along which I prefer not to believe, if it's hard data, I'll believe it.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.480
I won't believe it until it is hard data, however.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.820
But you've got to keep your mind open for any facts that come in.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.320
Or listen to any of the things that anybody says.

32:37.840 --> 32:41.080
And just hold it in abeyance until it's either proved or disproved.

32:41.080 --> 32:45.280
There's no sense in screaming about chariots from heaven.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.860
And then screaming just as hard as that there are no chariots from heaven.

32:49.480 --> 32:53.540
Just gather data quietly until you gather enough data about anything.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.620
You'll find out what the truth is.

32:57.040 --> 33:01.360
The only great crime in that area is to get data and then not tell anybody that you have it.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.920
And the military is extremely guilty of that.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.340
Right, okay.

33:08.740 --> 33:11.220
I guess I would probably characterize you.

33:12.080 --> 33:16.780
This is sort of another way of saying what we were just talking about as a romantic.

33:17.760 --> 33:21.460
And I would point to say a story like Thunder and Roses is an example of that.

33:21.780 --> 33:23.300
Yeah, that's a very interesting story.

33:23.420 --> 33:26.300
That was written, you know, when the death was still settling over here in Oshima.

33:27.020 --> 33:31.800
It's probably the first atomic doom story that was written after the bomb was dropped.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.920
It was written in late 1945.

33:38.620 --> 33:41.080
And I wrote that with considerable passion.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.720
There wasn't anybody in the world who understood what had happened,

33:45.020 --> 33:47.260
except the people in the science fiction fraternity,

33:47.740 --> 33:53.140
and maybe one or two rather forward thinking scientists at Oak Ridge and in the state of Washington.

33:54.140 --> 33:57.880
And for the rest of the world thought it was just another big bang.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.260
But in science fiction there, John Campbell had been publishing

34:03.160 --> 34:06.620
Atomic Power and Atomic War stories for 15 years before that.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.340
And we all understood what had happened.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.820
Every single person who had been writing or reading science fiction

34:12.820 --> 34:16.220
understood precisely what had happened and what it meant to the world.

34:17.540 --> 34:21.280
Now of course it's become very much in the forefront, but we all saw it coming.

34:23.880 --> 34:27.100
Very bad, an ugly situation.

34:28.340 --> 34:31.740
Yeah, that was a powerful story. I guess you get a lot of response about that one, don't you?

34:31.860 --> 34:34.040
Yes, I do. And it's been repented a good many times.

34:35.300 --> 34:40.340
As a matter of fact, Ben Bober was just about to publish it in Omni as a classic when he left.

34:40.880 --> 34:44.420
And I don't know what the situation is for the story again, but his chances are it will show up there.

34:46.500 --> 34:53.340
Yeah, and in relation to that too, you've written about a number of discoveries or events before they ever came about.

34:53.460 --> 34:54.840
Has that ever been pointed out to you?

34:55.660 --> 35:03.680
Time and again, last year a long section from one of my stories was the heading of an article

35:03.680 --> 35:09.420
in the Institute for Electronic and Electrical Engineers in their journal.

35:11.300 --> 35:17.900
And it had to do with the creation of a duplicated random.

35:18.500 --> 35:24.960
That is, you have a random sequence and you duplicate that random elsewhere, which is a direct contradiction in terms.

35:25.640 --> 35:34.280
But this happens to be just the core of a new development in satellite communications, particularly military satellite communications,

35:34.280 --> 35:42.580
which can't be tapped. You can't tap a random communication unless, of course, you can know what that randomness is.

35:42.700 --> 35:47.800
In the case it's not random anymore, but it's a duplicated random and essentially that's what's been developed.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.420
That was, oh, 20 years before it had been accomplished.

35:52.000 --> 35:59.080
I have an accuser of inventing Velcro, which is in one of my stories about 15 years before it appeared on the market,

35:59.080 --> 36:05.720
the illuminated wristwatch with a readout within one of my stories.

36:06.860 --> 36:14.820
The most amazing thing of all though was before Watson and Crick discovered the DNA, the structure of the DNA molecule,

36:15.860 --> 36:22.860
I had a story about some people who were marooned on a planet and when they came out of there, they had all been frozen.

36:22.860 --> 36:31.800
When they came out of their little frozen cocoons, they found that they were on a planet that was not on any of their star charts

36:31.800 --> 36:38.860
and standing in the cabin with them was a religious symbol of a double spiral.

36:39.960 --> 36:43.620
And the whole story had to do with evolution.

36:43.980 --> 36:50.020
First was positivism. Each generation of these marooned people was really more primitive than the one before.

36:50.020 --> 36:55.080
They got right down to the cell and then that cell began to revolve again into something else.

36:56.320 --> 37:03.520
And the whole figure, the whole symbolism there was of a double spiral, a double helix.

37:04.620 --> 37:10.160
And something that goes down to a base and continues to spiral back up again into something else.

37:11.640 --> 37:19.640
And knowing behold, years later Crick and Watson discovered the structure of the DNA molecule which contains all this information.

37:20.780 --> 37:26.640
Now where that kind of thing comes from, I just can't begin to tell you. But it has happened to me time and time and time again.

37:28.140 --> 37:30.640
That story you're referring to is the Golden Helix, wasn't it?

37:30.780 --> 37:30.900
Yeah.

37:32.080 --> 37:43.620
Yeah, I was thinking also about, I guess it was one of your very first science fiction stories, the Ether Breather in 1939 where you get a picture of the importance, the public importance, the impact of television.

37:43.860 --> 37:45.320
I didn't even know there was television then.

37:45.580 --> 37:49.540
Yeah, television became widely public around 1948.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.860
And I had already been writing for ten years then.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.700
I started writing as a very very much of a youngster.

37:58.540 --> 38:04.600
Do you recall how you assumed television was going to be so important or how that story came out?

38:05.120 --> 38:12.860
Well, I was living in New York at the time and long around Rockefeller Center there was a whole lot in the radio and newspapers about television.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.720
The first television broadcast was done in 1925 by some scientists at CBS.

38:19.720 --> 38:24.620
And they used the scanning disk with a bunch of little holes on a spinning disk.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.420
And the lights scanned up and down.

38:27.680 --> 38:35.040
The holes were drilled in a very close spiral and the light scanned back and forth at the spine, put little spots of light on the screen.

38:35.860 --> 38:41.840
And there was quite a battle between that system and the cathode ray tube.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.520
And this cathode ray tube finally won out.

38:45.460 --> 38:53.320
You'd have to have a spinning disk in your set too in the home and they'd have to be synchronized with what was being broadcast, which was the chief difficulty with it.

38:53.940 --> 39:02.820
But this interesting thing that in that story I learned a great deal of everything I could possibly find out about television at the time.

39:03.300 --> 39:09.020
And I realized the enormous difficulties back in white television was one thing, but color television was something else again.

39:09.020 --> 39:17.560
It was such a hard nut to crack and so complexly a technological achievement that I put it 200 years ahead in the future.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.800
And it turned out the first color sets came out about three years later.

39:22.960 --> 39:30.680
So often as science fiction writers, way ahead of science, there were times when science jumps way ahead of science fiction writers.

39:30.680 --> 39:38.440
The micro processor, for example, was hardly mentioned in any story ever until it suddenly appeared on people's wrists.

39:39.980 --> 39:43.100
I mean that's one time when technology really got the jump on us.

39:44.720 --> 39:59.280
I could kick myself for that too because way back in the early 40s I met a guy who told me about a German patent which had run out and was now public domain of a liquid crystal in which, if you pass the voltage to it,

39:59.280 --> 40:02.120
the transparent crystal became opaque.

40:02.980 --> 40:05.660
And he told me about that as a kind of laboratory phenomenon.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.660
I could have taken that and run with it, but I didn't.

40:09.180 --> 40:12.220
And that's the secret of your liquid crystal watch.

40:14.780 --> 40:21.640
Okay, one of my favorite stories that you've written, I don't think it's one of your more characteristic ones, but it's one of your better knowns, is the microcosmic god.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.580
Yeah, I'm not too fond of that story.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.860
Not because the idea isn't unique, it is.

40:26.500 --> 40:28.160
That was a brand new kind of an idea.

40:29.180 --> 40:33.880
But because it was so badly written, it was the first science fiction story I wrote.

40:34.660 --> 40:37.960
And it was so much that I did not know about writing.

40:38.500 --> 40:46.400
And one of the most important things about people as a whole, and if you're going to write people well, is that nobody's all bad. Nobody's all good either.

40:47.760 --> 40:55.700
But the heavy in there was the bank president, that he's cut out of 100% pure cardboard. He is so poorly written.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.820
And that angers me every time I think of it.

40:59.460 --> 41:04.460
If I were to write it today, he would be very dimensional, and there'd be some good things about him too.

41:04.620 --> 41:09.480
And then you could believe in the idea itself, the little people under the dome,

41:09.580 --> 41:14.600
which is so overwhelming that nobody else but me apparently knows how badly that story is written.

41:16.180 --> 41:21.700
Well, the idea carries it so well that the characterisation just isn't noticed, I don't think.

41:21.740 --> 41:24.160
That's right, yeah. This is called the devil principle.

41:24.980 --> 41:29.160
You come up with something really bright enough, people don't notice the flaws. But I do.

41:31.220 --> 41:34.660
Okay, listen, what about your horror fiction? Do you like to write horror stories?

41:35.720 --> 41:38.600
Sometimes, yes. It's nice to give a...

41:38.600 --> 41:41.760
They have an amazing impact on people sometimes.

41:42.320 --> 41:51.480
Although nowadays I think they're being vastly overdone and white people are flocking to see all these limitations of the exorcist and so on.

41:51.540 --> 41:55.260
I don't know, it's depressing, it really is.

41:56.120 --> 42:02.440
And each one you see, of course, has less impact than the one before, and it's got to be more bloody and more gory and more horrible,

42:02.740 --> 42:06.640
and more flash brains and buckets of gore and so on.

42:07.940 --> 42:11.020
So it loses its impact, you've got overdoses and that stuff.

42:12.340 --> 42:15.040
But there's certainly something in the titillation of horror.

42:17.240 --> 42:20.580
I wrote one story, it was called Professor Teddy Bear.

42:22.340 --> 42:28.140
Years later I went to a convention and the lady came up to me and she was all clothed.

42:28.140 --> 42:32.680
She was going to pull out my eyes out, she was so furious for having written that story.

42:32.680 --> 42:36.020
It seemed that when she read it, she didn't get to sleep for two weeks.

42:37.020 --> 42:43.840
And in some peculiar way she blamed me for it, that is, as if I had personally written it, personally to upset her.

42:46.240 --> 42:48.740
However, that kind of reaction is very rare.

42:49.420 --> 42:57.360
Mostly people kind of enjoy it because basically they know they're safe in spite of the fact that you have them living in terror for a little while.

42:59.280 --> 43:07.080
Yeah, that was a, I remember that story, but the one that impressed me the most is a very understated horror story and that would be Bianca's hands.

43:07.540 --> 43:12.920
Oh yeah, now that has really struck down deep to some people.

43:14.380 --> 43:15.880
And I couldn't find out why.

43:17.600 --> 43:23.380
I think it's the understatement of it, it's so subtly done that when you think about it, it just becomes more horrible all the time.

43:23.380 --> 43:27.640
Well, for one thing it's a love story, and very profoundly a love story.

43:28.340 --> 43:37.280
And people don't like to associate love with the things that happen in that story, and yet there's what they call the libistote, the love death.

43:39.060 --> 43:50.000
And essentially this kind of consternation, I think is something that on a very deep level that people do recognize that death and love have a great deal in common.

43:51.380 --> 43:55.380
The image of Kali, you know, the goddess, the Hindu goddess with all the arms.

43:57.300 --> 44:04.200
Kali is the goddess of death, but she's also the source. They're one and the same thing.

44:05.240 --> 44:18.120
And the idea of the libistote, the love death, has been worked by all kinds of people from Richard Wagner, that on through, that love and death are the same thing, that the ending is also the beginning.

44:19.320 --> 44:27.320
And people are gravitated to that, but it's down so deep that when they really begin to get a glimpse of it, they're terrified.

44:28.440 --> 44:40.220
One lady read this story once and it horrified her just terribly. She happened to be a rabid sturgeon fan, and I met her at a convention, and I recorded that story for Cadman Records.

44:42.260 --> 44:46.200
And it was for alternate worlds records, which is now in the possession of Cadman.

44:47.320 --> 44:53.780
And she definitely wanted to buy the record and get my autograph on it, but on the other hand she couldn't bear the story.

44:54.300 --> 45:00.500
And for once I had somebody who had been that profoundly affected, and I had a chance to cut and pin her wings for the wall and find out why.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.520
And she said, well, you know why?

45:04.520 --> 45:08.140
I said, no, like that. She said, no, I don't. Really, I don't. Tell me why it upsets you.

45:09.020 --> 45:13.220
And she said, all those disembodied hands crawling all around, all around over the house.
