00:15.860 --> 00:23.820
yeah this is a this is a place that we got a good picture of

00:28.600 --> 00:33.960
we're gonna have to study these more closely we'll

00:33.960 --> 00:43.500
go to the next slide these lights up here shouting at our eyes but yeah it's
hard to see now this is an impressionist painting that we got out of the Museum

00:43.500 --> 00:55.200
of National Art in Washington DC actually this is a picture taken of a desert a
desert area in Iran and it looks like an impressionist painting and when I saw

00:55.200 --> 01:04.940
it I said wow look at nobody will believe this and I looked at it since and I
don't believe it either but that's a whole area of desert silted sands and

01:04.940 --> 01:14.940
absolutely spectacular beauty unbelievable the next time now

01:14.940 --> 01:28.120
there's another one of those little known areas from the area that's hard to
recognize but it was the hometown for 444 days of 52 of our most distinguished

01:28.120 --> 01:42.880
humans and and we thought we'd send them a picture of their ex hometown
autographed from up outer space that's chair in our end next slide oh

01:42.880 --> 01:53.460
there there's like this is my favorite picture because this is the chief cook
and he's preparing a meal and it looks like he's in one gravity and that because

01:53.460 --> 02:03.720
he can hook his toes under that box down there and and just sit there and fix
things right up and he did an outstanding job of preparing chow and kept me

02:03.720 --> 02:13.260
alive that whole two days space programs come a long way with respect to food
that we've got on board they sure have a few steps to go but we're coming okay I

02:13.260 --> 02:17.680
believe that should be the last slide if we could terminate those and go ahead
and have the movie please

02:23.580 --> 02:35.680
after on the 36 rev we well actually hour or so before that we closed up these
payload bay doors and those things those big babies functioned without a hitch

02:35.680 --> 02:42.420
throughout the flight and I certainly was happy because one of the jobs John
said I was supposed to go outside and close them in case they didn't work but

02:42.420 --> 02:51.580
they they buckled down nice with no problem actually this shot was from taking
them at night you can notice that they bounce around quite a bit up in zero g

02:51.580 --> 02:57.660
which was one of the reasons we got these was to come back and show our guys
that are gonna be flying the next flight so they can handle the doors properly

02:57.660 --> 03:07.680
yeah they're not little doors they weigh about 3,500 3,600 pounds apiece and
they have a lot of resiliency and zero gravity this is taken out the window and

03:07.680 --> 03:18.420
it shows the first part of reentry it's done at two frames a second and it
actually there was a light pink glow going on right now pinkish the pinkish red

03:18.420 --> 03:26.800
glow out there and by golly this cap this film is not fast enough to capture it
it's just beautiful it's like flying in a pink world it's not the big fiery

03:26.800 --> 03:37.780
entry as some of our artistic friends that depicted it it's a 12 times faster in
real time but you can certainly get a feel for just how fast things are

03:37.780 --> 03:45.000
happening we're moving but not quite that fast yeah that was the role reversal
that occurred at Mach 18 and a half and the next role reversal is it just a

03:45.000 --> 03:56.860
little less than Mach 10 so you can see it's 12 times faster than real world
either that or we're slowing down a lot faster than I thought see those clouds

03:56.860 --> 04:07.040
out there there's the 10 Mach 10 role reversal this next one will be a role
reversal at Mach 4.8 and then we slow down the camera and if you can look out

04:07.040 --> 04:16.820
the window there Bakersfield is going by coming down to San Joaquin Valley yeah
Tehachapi's out there and this is a roll level that was done at about Mach 2 and

04:16.820 --> 04:25.980
a half when we're trying to intercept what we call a heading alignment circle
which is dig just a big teardrop approach into the field actually I'd like to

04:25.980 --> 04:34.760
stress that that whole entry with the exception to come up from right at Mach 2
was as smooth as anything you could you could wish for and that period the press

04:34.760 --> 04:43.280
kind of built up a little bit about the blackout period was uneventful except
the thing worked like we wanted it to tell you there was a couple of guys in

04:43.280 --> 04:51.120
there that was sweating through it though because if it hadn't worked we
couldn't uh couldn't be couldn't be here today and it just flew so solidly it

04:51.120 --> 05:00.740
was unbelievable much better than the simulators and I was happy to see that
this shows a couple of the other dry lake beds that are in the area of the

05:00.740 --> 05:08.000
Edwards complex which is one of the nice things that that facility offers for us
out there is there are lots of alternate runways in case you run into any kind

05:08.000 --> 05:19.260
of problems it's a chase plane join up scene that doesn't look too good there we
had two chase t-38s one carrying a TV camera this is an out the window scene of

05:19.260 --> 05:28.160
coming around the heading alignment circle pretty soon you'll see the the road
at the north end of Edwards complex coming in there we went we got overhead

05:28.160 --> 05:41.900
Edwards at about 40,000 feet and that's where we went subsonic and we basically
like entered on a on a downwind leg and just a big turn from overhead John took

05:41.900 --> 05:53.060
over flying the vehicle uh initially up at about Mach 4.8 and did a couple of
reversals there and and gave it back to auto a couple times but at this point he

05:53.060 --> 06:02.580
uh about 30 some odd thousand feet all the way down he was flying and the
vehicle was really doing it because it's an attitude the whole type vehicle and

06:02.580 --> 06:11.800
when you put the nose somewhere it just stays there none of our simulators have
been able to to do that uh attitude whole feature as well as it as the actual

06:11.800 --> 06:23.920
vehicle did it was a really impressive thing it's very difficult to see it but
there's an aim point out here somewhere which is a big triangle since we get

06:23.920 --> 06:24.640
rolled out here

06:28.500 --> 06:37.260
shows the chase plane join up and he's uh what's happening is uh John McBride in
the front seat Pinky Nelson in the back seat are taking pictures the underside

06:37.260 --> 06:47.880
of the orbiter to see how uh what kind of pre landing tile damage we got and
sure enough almost all the hits on the bottom a study of the films is revealed

06:47.880 --> 06:59.100
what due to uh something that happened before we hit the ground and we uh we're
in about an angle of glide of about 20 degrees at this point and the airspeed

06:59.100 --> 07:10.600
was about 285 knots we have a large speed brake on the rear end that john is
modulating to hold the airspeed it's just a perfect day for it too there was no

07:10.600 --> 07:22.500
wind to mount anything all the way down just a terrific flying day you couldn't
ask for any better for a first flight back to looking out my window again you

07:22.500 --> 07:32.060
may be able to see two windows on two uh dots on that black triangle just before
pre-flare which pre-flare is right there pre-flare is just under 2 000 feet when

07:32.060 --> 07:40.320
john pulls back on the stick those two dots show that we're coming down the
glide slope 20 degrees dropped the gear at about 275 knots it came down very

07:40.320 --> 07:50.220
fast it came down and uh most longest gear took to get down with six seconds the
chase airplane is calling out altitude of wheels above the ground because uh

07:50.220 --> 07:55.980
that height of wheel height is about 38 feet which is kind of like landing
something from a three-story building

07:59.360 --> 08:07.660
it's really a nice flying machine as soon as you touch down you put the nose
over to six degrees above the horizon and then all of a sudden it starts

08:07.660 --> 08:13.080
dropping and you can't hold it up i've never been aboard an airplane that
touchdown ended softer anywhere

08:18.940 --> 08:27.480
the rollout was nice and straight in fact john didn't didn't apply the brakes so
we were probably below 50 knots and that was mainly just to test them out well

08:27.480 --> 08:37.860
the data says it was 108 knots but you know actually we had a little failure on
one of the brake systems prior to early in uh that was what when that occurred

08:41.020 --> 08:48.400
those dry lake beds out there are nice and smooth it's like coming down a runway
and there's wheel stop

08:55.380 --> 09:04.680
we can go ahead and terminate the film now please i know it doesn't look like it
but that vehicle sitting there weighs 99 tons and although we like to brag that

09:04.680 --> 09:18.440
it's as big as a dc9 what it really is is a dc9 but it has a section of fuselage
in there that's a dc10 it's got the capability it's a dc10 fuselage it's a 22

09:18.440 --> 09:27.900
feet in diameter and the payload bay is of course 60 feet long and 15 feet in
diameter we're going to use it to uh we're going to use this thing with this big

09:27.900 --> 09:40.200
payload capability to put up to 65 000 pounds in low earth orbit and i think it
will just revolutionize the way that uh that we do business uh in around the

09:40.200 --> 09:50.380
world it really will it has a lot of potential for advancing science and
technology in the united states and and i certainly believe that we must we must

09:50.380 --> 10:01.220
pursue this somehow if we're going to make it we're going to have to do it with
our brains and and uh uh with the space shuttle uh it offers us the opportunity

10:01.220 --> 10:12.300
to do in space science and advanced technology in this country i believe uh in
it will in five to ten years we'll be able to do what it takes 20 to 30 years to

10:12.300 --> 10:21.160
do without the space shuttle there were a couple of newspapers that really did
give us a bad time about the space shuttle you know and uh they don't belong to

10:21.160 --> 10:33.240
this outfit they were pravda and tass and and i didn't realize how right we were
doing things till i read how bad they thought about it must have been doing

10:33.240 --> 10:41.620
something right right it was enjoyable from start to finish the thing just
worked unbelievably well i couldn't believe it krip and i had been trained to

10:41.620 --> 10:52.020
handle something just this side of armageddon and it just didn't turn out we
almost uh oh i wouldn't say bored we had a lot of a opportunity to sit back and

10:52.020 --> 11:01.640
enjoy the view which is the way we wanted to do it john said we think that we've
got a fantastic technological capability uh over the next couple of years we're

11:01.640 --> 11:10.820
going to be flying the shuttle considerably more we're building some more of
them and i don't think that we necessarily have to go out and and sell the

11:10.820 --> 11:18.460
shuttle now that we've got it flying i think it will sell itself one of the
things that john and i are going to be trying to do is to convince people that

11:18.460 --> 11:30.400
we ought to be starting to pursue putting the united states in orbit permanently
with the building of some type of permanent manned person excuse me ladies space

11:30.400 --> 11:41.920
station and we're going to be talking to our administration about that well i
i'll tell you what i think we would like to try to entertain a few questions

11:41.920 --> 11:49.160
from the audience if we have a little bit more time vince yeah maybe just a few
why don't you bring the lights up there are microphones across the floor we've

11:49.160 --> 11:57.540
got probably about five minutes and john and bob would like to answer a few
questions see what's on your mind uh just step up to the microphone if you would

11:57.540 --> 12:04.900
and ask ask a question maybe let me ask you this first while someone is getting
the microphone maybe you can tell us a little bit more about the personal

12:04.900 --> 12:16.220
considerations the food and the kind of food and how you go to the bathroom all
those good things john have you got any answers for those well the last four

12:16.220 --> 12:27.580
hours of the mission you couldn't because the uh the machine had broken but uh
and y'all had wondered why john was jumping around outside the spacecraft no no

12:27.580 --> 12:38.840
no no i was jumping around because the tiles were still there actually going to
the bathroom in space is very straightforward activity just like it is on earth

12:38.840 --> 12:51.100
and uh but you have to be very careful yeah but vince was right we did have uh
uh the the potty was the only significant malfunction i think that we we

12:51.100 --> 13:00.600
encountered except for one of our instrumentation recorders uh and it worked not
well and slowly degraded to the point where like four hours prior to entry it

13:00.600 --> 13:08.060
wasn't functioning at all and we've got some of our engineers working on that
because our compatriots are talking about a seven-day flight and i don't think

13:08.060 --> 13:16.640
they'd like that if it wasn't working any more questions yes i have a question
uh mr chairman i'd like to i'm billy morris from augusta georgia i would like to

13:16.640 --> 13:28.980
address this question to john uh who actually made the landing tell us uh in
your training did you actually practice this landing uh prior to making this one

13:28.980 --> 13:39.640
and secondly uh tell us a little bit about the alignment and the guidance system
which uh brought you to the end of the runway uh is this similar to the ils

13:39.640 --> 13:49.200
systems used in commercial airlines uh a flight director system or tell us just
a little bit about how you got lined up right at the end of the runway well you

13:49.200 --> 13:59.120
do practice a lot manual landing we have a shuttle train airplane which is a
modified gulf stream 2 with a computer in it it uses uh when you come down that

13:59.120 --> 14:08.380
outer glide slope it has to use almost full reverse thrust to give you the same
glide angle it has direct lift flaps on it to give you more drag you throw the

14:08.380 --> 14:18.640
wheels down to give you drag and it's very difficult to make an airplane a
conventional airliner fly as bad as a space shuttle but we we managed to do that

14:18.640 --> 14:28.940
and so we have a very realistic training training uh device and you practice it
a lot because like cript says 38 foot 38 foot height of eye in the air is not

14:28.940 --> 14:38.820
the routine thing for most fighter pilots to land airplanes is it maybe for 747
pilots so you practice it a lot and you practice all kinds of contingency things

14:38.820 --> 14:54.880
but no two landings are alike so we really didn't get a chance to practice for
this one i think

14:54.880 --> 15:04.940
that john logs something like 1300 approaches in the shuttle training aircraft
besides the simulator so he tried it once twice the second question is the

15:04.940 --> 15:16.460
guidance system that got us there you use uh the navigation system that got us
there is a tactical uh you use tac-can which is a bearing and ranging device and

15:16.460 --> 15:28.080
then you on the outer glide slope at 18 000 feet we shifted to a microwave
landing system which is a very uh uh new uh it operates on a ku band it's a new

15:28.080 --> 15:38.780
system that we're going to be able to couple the autoland system into and fly it
all the way into one of these days zero zero weather and i don't want to be on

15:38.780 --> 15:50.440
that one either but it's uh you know it's going to take the brave men to do that
i think and i'm not in that category any other questions what's there another

15:50.440 --> 15:55.240
question paul flynn from the

15:55.240 --> 16:01.600
fort soviet union's space program right now uh the

16:01.600 --> 16:12.200
question was how do we see our position with respect to the soviets uh in regard
to the space program people uh still keep wanting to bring that particular

16:12.200 --> 16:21.160
subject up from areas back when we were supposedly doing a race for the moon or
whatever and i guess you can judge it from various standpoints i had the

16:21.160 --> 16:31.960
opportunity to train with the cosmonauts back uh in 75 when we were doing the
joint mission apollo soyuz uh i was very much by impressed by the soviet's

16:31.960 --> 16:45.080
determination to stay in space and continue on with basically what appeared to
me to be put building some type of a permanent space station on orbit and

16:45.080 --> 16:55.440
eventually going out to the planets they want to do that with the respect to
basic technology i don't think they come close yet but they really have a

16:55.440 --> 17:06.360
determination uh one last question steve stewart st cloud times what were the
nature and scope of the scientific experiments on the columbia mission

17:06.360 --> 17:19.640
scientific type of experiments that you tried in addition to photographs while
even the photograph were bootleg we were supposed to do a test mission in the uh

17:19.640 --> 17:30.920
scientific type internal to the vehicle uh test uh measurements that we made are
like radiation we had radiation counters all over the thing you want to see what

17:30.920 --> 17:41.680
kind of radiation shielding you got and on specific scientific things uh since
it was a basic test mission we really didn't have any we had uh five tons of

17:41.680 --> 17:51.540
development flight instrumentation in those pallets in the back of the ship that
were measuring temperatures and pressures i think our basic contribution was uh

17:51.540 --> 18:03.360
if it was a scientific one was a investigation of the hypersonic flight regime
and i'm glad to tell you that that worked satisfactorily we were not 100 sure at

18:03.360 --> 18:13.560
least i wasn't that it was going to any other questions or no i think we're just
about out of time okay bob john thank you very much for being here and for

18:13.560 --> 18:18.420
giving us something to be proud about it we sure enjoyed it so

18:45.080 --> 18:50.020
thank you your
