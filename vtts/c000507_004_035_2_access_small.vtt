WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.800
Is the cassette changed?

00:02.920 --> 00:03.460
Everything's going.

00:03.580 --> 00:05.360
Okay, we're all set if you are.

00:05.560 --> 00:06.580
Oh, the tape is rolling again.

00:06.660 --> 00:07.420
The tape is rolling?

00:09.400 --> 00:10.220
Not there yet.

00:11.940 --> 00:13.520
Okay, are you there?

00:13.840 --> 00:14.040
Yep.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.160
Okay, the tape is rolling, so we're ready.

00:16.240 --> 00:16.960
So I'll reiterate.

00:17.220 --> 00:20.440
Just how do you go about editing a book?

00:21.320 --> 00:24.120
Okay, well, I'll tell you how I went about editing a book.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.160
I had the idea, this was way back in the early 70s,

00:30.040 --> 00:34.420
of doing a book of science fiction by women, about women.

00:34.680 --> 00:38.020
I didn't think there'd be much point in doing science fiction by women

00:38.020 --> 00:40.740
and having it all be about men or something,

00:40.900 --> 00:46.280
because, I mean, that wouldn't really focus the book,

00:46.340 --> 00:48.160
at least as far as I was concerned it wouldn't.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.160
But I wanted to do something like that.

00:51.160 --> 00:56.940
It occurred to me that there were a lot of stories that could be used,

00:57.560 --> 01:01.140
and then I tried to sell the book and I could call it.

01:01.580 --> 01:03.300
I sent it around everywhere.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.240
I sent it from the highest to the lowest.

01:06.420 --> 01:08.180
I mean, I sent it to schlocky publishers,

01:08.560 --> 01:09.940
I sent it to good publishers,

01:10.140 --> 01:12.360
I sent it to publishers in between the two streams,

01:12.580 --> 01:15.880
and I would get letters back saying,

01:15.980 --> 01:18.580
this is a very nice idea, somebody should do this,

01:18.620 --> 01:19.980
but it isn't going to be us.

01:21.280 --> 01:24.680
This is very nice, but it has limited appeal.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.200
That was my favorite.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.600
I said, yes, it certainly does.

01:27.780 --> 01:30.140
It's only a little more than 50% of the population.

01:30.660 --> 01:35.520
But, I've been sending it around for about two years.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.220
And finally, when I was about ready to give up,

01:41.980 --> 01:44.260
I got a letter from Von de McIntyre,

01:44.400 --> 01:47.480
who had found out that someone at Vintage Books

01:47.480 --> 01:50.900
was interested in an anthology of that kind.

01:51.140 --> 01:54.220
And in fact, they had, I guess, asked her if she wanted to do one.

01:54.340 --> 01:56.180
She had known that I was sending my book around

01:56.180 --> 01:57.480
and not having much luck with it,

01:57.520 --> 02:00.120
so she told me about this, which was, you know,

02:00.180 --> 02:02.440
to, so it's certainly kind of her to do.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.980
And I submitted the book to them and they took it.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.100
After that, I had to learn about editing

02:11.100 --> 02:14.440
because I had to start weeding things out.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.340
I had to realize that I couldn't put every last thing

02:17.340 --> 02:21.460
in the book that I had to have some sort of structure

02:21.460 --> 02:25.180
to the story, some sort of way of setting them up in the book

02:25.180 --> 02:27.580
so that they sort of followed one from the other.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.280
I decided, finally, just to use the obvious method,

02:30.320 --> 02:32.700
which was to take the one that was published earliest

02:32.700 --> 02:33.680
and put it at the beginning,

02:33.960 --> 02:35.840
and take the one that was published most recently

02:35.840 --> 02:38.740
and put it at the end so you sort of see how things

02:38.740 --> 02:39.840
progress over time.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.560
And then after that, I had to write the introduction.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.340
And that was probably the hardest part

02:44.340 --> 02:46.200
because I had to do quite a lot of research for that.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.300
But I think it helped me.

02:48.580 --> 02:52.840
And I also think it probably aided the other two books,

02:53.180 --> 02:54.300
which I did later.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.780
Those, the other two women of Wonder Books,

02:58.760 --> 03:01.820
I had not thought of doing them when I did the first.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.900
And the publisher was the one that proposed them to me.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.740
They proposed the second one, first of all,

03:06.840 --> 03:09.140
and then asked me if I wanted to do a third one also,

03:10.220 --> 03:12.340
thinking, I guess, that everything is supposed to come

03:12.340 --> 03:13.160
in threes nowadays.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.640
And that was why I did the other two.

03:21.140 --> 03:24.160
But I don't know if that would work for anyone else

03:24.160 --> 03:27.260
as far as if I were giving advice to someone as to how to edit.

03:27.660 --> 03:30.460
But all I can say is if you have an idea that's really striking

03:30.460 --> 03:35.200
and you really feel that there's a lack of that particular kind of book,

03:35.320 --> 03:38.860
that it is something that would be valuable to readers

03:40.400 --> 03:41.760
for many years,

03:41.760 --> 03:46.060
or that presents certain stories that haven't been reprinted

03:46.060 --> 03:50.420
or that presents stories in a certain way that is itself informative.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.700
And if you're really determined, I think it's worth it

03:53.700 --> 03:56.540
just to keep sending the thing around and sending it around

03:56.540 --> 03:58.280
and waiting until somebody buys it.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.300
At which point you will then learn about what editing a book is, I suppose.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.880
Since I didn't really know what it was when I was sending the proposal around.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.020
I had to learn it as I was doing the first book.

04:07.940 --> 04:11.200
How do you get people to submit stories once the idea is there?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.260
Well, what I did with this book is I had an easier task, I think,

04:16.320 --> 04:21.060
because I used stories that had already been published.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.620
But what I had to do is I had to read about everything.

04:25.820 --> 04:28.880
I could get my hands on magazines and apologies.

04:32.100 --> 04:35.040
Old paperback reprints, everything.

04:35.540 --> 04:41.280
I had to read about probably 50 times as many stories

04:41.280 --> 04:44.700
as I actually wound up publishing for each book.

04:45.980 --> 04:53.800
And then once I had the list of stories that I finally wanted to use,

04:54.060 --> 04:56.300
at that point I would write to the office.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.800
Of course, then you have the problem of what if somebody can't give you the right to reprint the story.

05:00.980 --> 05:02.900
And that happened to me a couple of times.

05:02.900 --> 05:06.160
There were a couple of stories I wanted to use and I could not get permission for them.

05:06.960 --> 05:11.340
Not through any fault of the authors, just because the stories were tied up in some way.

05:14.400 --> 05:19.700
And that made it necessary to do a little restructuring on a couple of the books.

05:20.060 --> 05:24.160
But overall, I'm satisfied with the way they turned out.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.240
And there wasn't a single story in any of them that I didn't like myself.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.680
I think that's important.

05:30.680 --> 05:36.320
I think an editor has to pick stories that she likes for whatever reason

05:36.940 --> 05:41.360
and put those in rather than worrying about what someone else is going to like.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.840
I think if you like the stories, someone else will too anyway.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.660
And the chances are good if you try to get a variety of stories

05:52.660 --> 05:55.260
that you'll have something that appeals to almost anyone.

05:57.780 --> 06:02.560
So you aim for your taste really and if you want to be a commercial success,

06:02.620 --> 06:06.260
you hope that your taste and those of the public at large jive.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.900
That's what I keep doing and everything.

06:09.420 --> 06:15.300
I suppose that that's probably naive in some ways,

06:15.420 --> 06:18.260
but I think I'd rather be naive than cynical.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.620
I just don't think there's any point in worrying about what other people like.

06:25.740 --> 06:30.940
First of all, I think people like a lot more things than many publishers are willing to admit

06:30.940 --> 06:32.760
or give them credit for liking.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.260
I mean, the publishers talk as if there's a great appetite for junk

06:38.260 --> 06:40.380
and that's what they might as well publish.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.240
And yet, whenever I talk to anybody, I hear things like,

06:44.780 --> 06:47.760
God, all this junk on the bookshelves, you know,

06:48.640 --> 06:52.640
why are they publishing all these trashy books or things like that?

06:52.720 --> 06:54.220
I hear that kind of comment all the time.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.580
Not just about science fiction, I mean about a lot of things.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.420
I don't think science fiction is the worst offender in this regard.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.480
It may be one of them, but it's not the worst.

07:03.680 --> 07:08.700
And I really don't think that there is some appetite for junk.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.480
Everybody has, I suppose, their favorite little bit of junk that they like

07:13.480 --> 07:15.140
or their particular advice.

07:17.100 --> 07:20.320
But I don't think the appetite is as great as publishers think.

07:20.420 --> 07:25.560
I think a lot of publishers operate their companies as if they have contempt

07:25.560 --> 07:27.540
for the people who read the book.

07:28.460 --> 07:33.280
And I especially think this is true, I'm afraid, among some of the science fiction editors.

07:35.020 --> 07:39.300
And it's too bad because I don't think the appetite for junk is quite as large as they think.

07:40.860 --> 07:46.940
And I do think that good books that can hang on and stay around for a while

07:46.940 --> 07:53.200
have a much better chance over the long run of doing well for the publisher.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.980
Although the publishers don't seem to realize this.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.220
I don't think you can concoct books, in other words.

07:58.280 --> 08:03.160
I don't think you can sit there and try to concoct something that people are going to buy.

08:04.120 --> 08:09.280
I think you have to be sincere about it.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.260
And I think that in that lousy book, there are going to be a lot of readers who may respond to that sincerity.

08:13.920 --> 08:19.360
And however flawed the book may be, there will be an essential thing in it that readers will like

08:19.360 --> 08:23.440
or respond to in some way, even if it's not a critical success.

08:24.880 --> 08:30.600
But if you try to concoct something or deliberately set out to engineer a book

08:30.600 --> 08:33.820
that's going to appeal to a lot of people, I just don't think it works.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.260
I think readers can spot that sort of thing.

08:36.260 --> 08:40.440
They may read it. They may buy it if there's nothing else on the stand.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.940
But I don't think that they'll choose it if they have a choice.

08:49.120 --> 08:54.260
Okay. I want to now kind of sum up your work.

08:55.600 --> 09:01.200
I found a sentence when I was reading the afterward to Gene Wolfe's fifth head of servers, which you wrote.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.020
And I'll read it. It's a short quote.

09:04.020 --> 09:07.040
And to me, it sums up what your work is all about.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.620
And I want to see if you agree with me.

09:09.020 --> 09:10.660
Okay. The quote is,

09:11.100 --> 09:17.460
The quest for certainty and our notion of human beings as separate cells seeking a power over other separate cells

09:17.820 --> 09:21.880
must give way to a more integrated view of the universe and our growing place in it.

09:22.780 --> 09:26.520
To me, that sums up a lot of what your fiction is about.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.960
Well, I'm trying to think what to say to that.

09:31.960 --> 09:32.800
Yeah.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.440
Yeah. Just give me a couple of seconds.

09:36.780 --> 09:40.460
I'll think about that. See if there's anything illuminating I can say.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.080
Well, it's just my guess too, so it may even be wrong.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.820
No, I think it's probably true.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.120
I think it's probably true.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.960
I think, well...

09:59.620 --> 10:03.940
I think there are great many problems in the world, if not most of them,

10:04.020 --> 10:10.240
have probably been caused by people wanting an absolute certainty

10:10.240 --> 10:13.140
or seeking an absolute kind of power

10:13.140 --> 10:18.860
or seeing things in these divisive kinds of ways.

10:19.700 --> 10:26.460
And I think, and without that sort of thing, I think it's obvious things would be better.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.920
This is going to sound very platitudinous, I'm sure.

10:32.740 --> 10:34.620
Nope. Sometimes platitudes are right.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.800
Okay. That's the formal interview.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.820
I wanted to ask you a couple of things from a fan's point of view.

10:43.820 --> 10:50.400
I was looking at your letter last night where you had the books that you were going to sell me.

10:50.780 --> 10:55.720
The four anthologies, I couldn't tell if they were first editions or not.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.760
Do you know all the vintage paperbacks? Are they first editions?

11:00.080 --> 11:03.840
No. By now they wouldn't be. They've all been reprinted.

11:03.860 --> 11:06.380
Okay. But the copies that you have?

11:06.940 --> 11:12.960
Yeah. No. Well, with the women of wonder, I don't think I have any first editions.

11:13.540 --> 11:19.320
I don't have a couple floating around, but with the other books, I do have some firsts of Bio Futures

11:19.320 --> 11:22.460
and I do have some firsts of the other two also.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.760
Okay. But women of wonder, not okay.

11:25.220 --> 11:28.420
I may pick those up one of these days if you still have them around.

11:29.900 --> 11:33.800
Yeah. I do have copies. I do have copies of all of them.

11:35.100 --> 11:39.720
Okay. Or if you want vintage hazelnut print, too, so you can always get them from them, too.

11:39.720 --> 11:46.840
Okay. I kind of tend to go for first editions if I can get them, so I may have some of my friends look for them,

11:46.900 --> 11:48.320
see what I can do.

11:50.820 --> 11:57.300
You and George both seem to have to hold Pat Labrudo in high esteem.

11:58.120 --> 12:04.320
Would he be a good editor for us to talk to as far as just getting an interview from an editor from his point of view?

12:04.960 --> 12:05.720
Is he accessible?

12:06.140 --> 12:10.460
Yeah. He might be interesting. I'll tell you why.

12:10.660 --> 12:14.980
Well, first of all, he worked at Ace before he worked at Double Day.

12:16.420 --> 12:20.160
And what he would be interesting for is...

12:20.160 --> 12:20.780
I'll keep going.

12:22.120 --> 12:26.320
First of all, he could tell you about what it's like to work at a paperback house.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.500
He could tell you about what it's like to work at a hardcover house.

12:29.660 --> 12:34.920
I think he probably has almost too much work to do, probably, at Double Day.

12:34.920 --> 12:39.880
He certainly has plenty of work to do, although at Ace I think he was much more overworked.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.020
But I think he might be interesting to talk to.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.340
Okay, good. We don't want to bother him if he doesn't want to be bothered,

12:47.440 --> 12:53.360
but we would like to get an editor's point of view and maybe some advice and that sort of thing, too.

12:53.920 --> 13:01.020
Well, one thing that might be useful to ask him also is that Double Day is probably one of the few places

13:01.020 --> 13:07.280
where it's at least somewhat possible for a first novelist to get a novel published.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.520
I mean, a first novel, say...

13:09.520 --> 13:14.220
It's easier to get one published there than at some other places, I think.

13:15.940 --> 13:18.960
So for...you know, that might be something to ask him about.

13:19.100 --> 13:23.320
What is the chance for a first novel being published?

13:24.800 --> 13:30.780
Okay. One thing we're working on is...

13:30.780 --> 13:35.240
We're trying to force them off on the public, at which time we'll, of course, contact you.

13:37.260 --> 13:40.560
But that we're also interested in talking to editors for that reason.

13:40.740 --> 13:42.960
But we're interested in talking to them.

13:43.080 --> 13:47.040
They're just another facet of science fiction field that fans know very little about.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.560
In fact, we know very little about. We'd like to find out a lot more about them.

13:51.080 --> 13:56.620
They're always something that you...they're maligned in print and people trying to submit books.

13:56.620 --> 14:00.180
They're these evil ogres that are sitting up there between them and fame.

14:00.580 --> 14:03.060
And we'd just like to get their point of view one of these days.

14:04.520 --> 14:12.000
Yeah. Well, probably would be a good one to ask since his line is one of the larger ones, for one thing.

14:12.940 --> 14:15.240
And it's one of the more long-standing ones.

14:15.380 --> 14:18.540
I mean, Double Day has had a science fiction line for quite some time now.

14:20.140 --> 14:22.580
So he might be interesting to talk to about that.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.420
But the best thing to do is just ask him. If he is too busy, he'll tell you.

14:28.480 --> 14:28.880
Okay.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.840
I don't think he'd be mad at being asked.

14:33.840 --> 14:39.300
Okay. Okay, listen, it's been very nice talking to you. Thank you for consenting.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.380
And we look forward to seeing what else comes out.

14:43.960 --> 14:51.180
Okay, yeah, we will...we can send you a copy of the interview and what we will do when we cut it up and make the programs.

14:51.180 --> 14:55.500
We will also...no, we can. We will send you copies of that program as well.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.300
We'll send her a copy of the programs as they're aired this week.

14:58.440 --> 15:03.680
Yeah, as they're...the program...so what you will hear, the program part will be what will be aired on the radio.

15:04.360 --> 15:10.120
So that will probably, what, two or three months whenever it goes on the schedule, yeah.

15:10.540 --> 15:14.640
But we'll have them long before that. So one of these days, we'll get those to you.

15:14.880 --> 15:15.300
Okay.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.920
And sure appreciate it and look forward to seeing more good things from you.

15:19.240 --> 15:19.640
Okay.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.580
Okay. Bye-bye now.
