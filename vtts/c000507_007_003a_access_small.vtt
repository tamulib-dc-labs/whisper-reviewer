00:01.720 --> 00:06.240
Your first stories and novels didn't appear when they're written.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.540
They didn't appear when you were in your mid-30s or so.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.540
What had you been doing up until that time?

00:10.580 --> 00:12.400
Now, I had a couple of careers.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.660
You know, mine was a draft degeneration.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.960
We all got drafted at 18, you know, right into the Army.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.780
And I spent the next four years in the AOT, the Army Occupation of Texas.

00:24.220 --> 00:29.060
I sent all the Yankees down here to, you know, teach conglomerate school and aerial gunnery.

00:29.530 --> 00:34.580
I went to art school after the war and then spent 10 years as a commercial artist, mostly in comics.

00:35.260 --> 00:39.940
And then graduated into editing, editing comics, editing pulp magazines.

00:40.280 --> 00:46.080
So I had been around professionally in publishing for a good 10 years, which was not a handicap.

00:46.260 --> 00:46.980
I think it helped.

00:50.400 --> 00:54.060
You were involved, from my understanding, in comics and art.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.180
Did this help you later on with science fiction?

00:57.740 --> 01:00.700
Well, it was a two-barrel question, you know.

01:03.580 --> 01:05.460
I always read science fiction.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.300
Now, the science fiction fan, at the time I was seven years old,

01:08.640 --> 01:12.680
and I read this stuff, read before the Army, afterwards, and then I illustrated science fiction.

01:13.340 --> 01:16.140
And through that, I knew all the authors as an artist.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.660
I was Harry the Artist, and I illustrated books for them and magazine.

01:20.060 --> 01:21.500
And I was around writers all the time.

01:21.760 --> 01:22.360
Science fiction writers.

01:22.460 --> 01:23.500
I really didn't care much about writing.

01:23.820 --> 01:24.980
I cared about science fiction.

01:25.820 --> 01:30.500
So when I started stepping sideways out of drawing into editing and writing,

01:30.840 --> 01:31.660
I wrote everything.

01:31.820 --> 01:35.040
I wrote men's adventures, westerns, historical articles.

01:35.740 --> 01:41.160
I did a fine article on the history of Texas about the Battle of Goliath,

01:41.200 --> 01:42.180
which no one remembers but me.

01:43.900 --> 01:46.980
And then I started writing fiction, and I naturally wrote science fiction.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.620
And I naturally sold it, I suppose, because I'd been writing a lot,

01:50.720 --> 01:52.120
been around the arts for a long time.

01:52.120 --> 01:56.300
And if anything, it helped my visual sense.

01:56.500 --> 02:01.400
When you read my stuff, I hope the rear has a physical sense of where they are

02:01.400 --> 02:03.600
and what's happening, and that's it.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.840
Was your first sale to John Campbell?

02:07.440 --> 02:07.940
No, no.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.620
My first sale was to Damon Knight, who I knew as an editor.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.400
He did a magazine called Worlds Beyond.

02:15.060 --> 02:16.500
I was illustrating about half of it.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.880
And the third issue, I illustrated almost all of it,

02:18.880 --> 02:22.800
but I got down the flu and I couldn't draw, but I could type.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.480
I wrote a short story and asked him what I should do with it.

02:25.780 --> 02:27.140
He paid me $100 for it.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.900
It's a good beginning, you know, I thought.

02:29.180 --> 02:32.140
And my agent at the time, Fred Pohl, put an anthology.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.280
Wow, that's the way to start your career.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.980
And it took me years to sell anything after that.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.560
I didn't write much fiction, but very early on,

02:42.120 --> 02:44.180
I think maybe a second or third or fourth sale,

02:44.960 --> 02:48.120
I sent the Stainless Steel Rat story to John Campbell.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.000
He bought it as a novelette.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.540
And after that, my relationship with him was very close.

02:53.700 --> 02:58.360
I see him all the time, work with him, and since collaborate with him.

02:58.900 --> 03:02.500
And all my first five or six novels were done as serials for analog.

03:03.800 --> 03:08.460
And when I say collaborate, I would send John an outline of an idea,

03:08.600 --> 03:10.240
a page or two of a book I'd like to do.

03:10.700 --> 03:15.860
I was thinking about doing, he sent back 18 page letter of what I could do with the book.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.720
He would never tell you to do something.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.380
He just suggested, do you ever think of doing that or that?

03:20.980 --> 03:25.940
And with his help, I developed a lot of tools.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.940
And I was a typical Campbell writer.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.120
I read the magazine, so I was born, I suppose.

03:30.860 --> 03:33.720
And I didn't bend to John's will.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.560
I just wanted to be there as a Campbell writer.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.700
And I really was a typical one for, I said, the first half dozen books

03:40.100 --> 03:42.580
until I had an idea for a book I knew John would not buy,

03:42.580 --> 03:46.180
a book called Bill the Galactic Hero, which I never submitted to him.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.300
And my feelings were right, I'll tell you, years later.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.360
I was in his office and he said, why did you write that book?

03:53.880 --> 03:55.640
What book, John? What Bill the Galactic Hero?

03:55.700 --> 03:57.040
I said, how do you know I wrote it?

03:57.080 --> 03:59.840
He said, I saw it in the subway newsstand and I bought it.

04:00.180 --> 04:02.840
The whole thought of him buying, he didn't get enough of them,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.300
slush pie, he had to go out and buy books.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.860
And I gave him some waffling answer about why I wrote it.

04:08.860 --> 04:11.480
Because it was a direct opposite of everything he believed in and wanted to do.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.960
It was experimental prose, it was anti-military,

04:15.380 --> 04:17.900
he put the boot to fascist, all the good things, you know.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.840
You drew him very well and wrote for him and understood his system.

04:26.020 --> 04:28.260
What is your comment to people that say,

04:28.480 --> 04:31.020
some people think he had a very healthy effect on science fiction,

04:31.180 --> 04:34.680
some people think he would have been better off without it?

04:36.360 --> 04:38.980
John W. Campbell invented modern science fiction.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.800
When he came along, it was just pulp garbage.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.560
He took it and shaped it.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.400
What we see today, John Campbell did.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.380
His personal attitude towards number of things,

04:49.520 --> 04:53.460
engineering wise, politics wise, I disagree with him at the time

04:53.460 --> 04:54.320
and told him so.

04:54.940 --> 04:57.960
But his overall effect in the field, he did what you see today,

04:58.240 --> 04:59.020
John Campbell did.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.060
Perhaps it had been done eventually.

05:01.060 --> 05:08.300
But single handedly, he stepped down from the mount with the tablets

05:08.300 --> 05:13.540
and took this dismal fantasy field

05:13.540 --> 05:16.820
and developed his modern intellectual, intelligent,

05:17.060 --> 05:18.420
scientifically based science fiction.

05:18.720 --> 05:19.820
It's gone a lot different ways since.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.740
I mean now half of science fiction is pure fantasy.

05:23.340 --> 05:27.280
The solid core that he made people do is very, very dim.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.200
But without that core, you wouldn't have modern science fiction.

05:31.960 --> 05:35.040
Your first novel that was published,

05:35.660 --> 05:38.160
first science fiction novel that was published,

05:38.320 --> 05:39.380
I should put it was Death World.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.700
And that's adventure fiction, which is probably what you're noted for.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.100
And Jason Denault was your main character.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.560
How did that evolve?

05:49.700 --> 05:51.420
Did Jason hit you and then the plot?

05:51.780 --> 05:53.900
Or did he just come up with what you were thinking?

05:55.220 --> 05:57.400
Death World does a number of things.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.600
You mentioned the fact that it was adventure science fiction.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.620
Well, don't laugh, but at that time in science fiction,

06:04.840 --> 06:07.060
which was Campbell, which was analog.

06:07.580 --> 06:08.700
If you were a true blue reader,

06:09.280 --> 06:12.080
you read Starling Stories in Trillion Wonder,

06:12.440 --> 06:15.160
because you'd had to wait another three weeks for the next issue of...

06:15.160 --> 06:16.580
Astounding, that's where the action was.

06:17.140 --> 06:18.660
And he had been very cerebral.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.380
He had a whole novel of people talking to each other.

06:21.860 --> 06:23.840
Nothing moving at all, no action.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.880
And I want to do a book that had action part of the plot.

06:28.260 --> 06:31.020
I mean, that's sort of stupid to say now with all the guns blowing heads away.

06:31.160 --> 06:36.020
I mean, that whole gore school and the whole sword and sorcery, sword and butchery.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.840
I mean, action galore, for no reason at all.

06:39.980 --> 06:42.400
But in those days, it was getting dim, I thought.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.300
So I worked out, but I didn't want to do an action plot for action, say.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.260
So I'm a great back plotter, and it says I find a reason to do a book

06:50.260 --> 06:51.560
and then fit a book to the reason.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.200
And the reason I want to have the action, I want to have a realistic.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.560
So I thought it was Superman.

06:58.180 --> 07:02.900
And in this book, you find, if you look at it closely, it's done two or three levels.

07:02.980 --> 07:04.140
The action plots a service.

07:04.620 --> 07:08.820
But there below that is the idea of Superman and Nietzsche talked about.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.340
And that Superman magazine talks about.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.280
And I'm very much against Superman, physical Superman.

07:14.820 --> 07:19.220
And if you look in the book, you'll see that if you are so brutalized to be physically a Superman,

07:19.220 --> 07:21.160
your intellectual content is zero.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.220
And I said that in a number of different ways.

07:24.120 --> 07:27.700
And I'm very much against militarism, and that's been there in a number of different ways.

07:28.180 --> 07:30.020
All of it couched in an adventure plot.

07:30.460 --> 07:33.440
And it's up to the reader to read whichever way he wants.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.200
And he'll find a good adventure plot if he wants to find even more about it.

07:38.460 --> 07:41.140
I remember when I first published it, a reader in England came up to me,

07:41.520 --> 07:48.140
and I was looking forward to great return from literate Englishmen about heavily intellectual content.

07:48.140 --> 07:51.300
And he said, oh, I read that book.

07:51.460 --> 07:52.760
I saw my friends to read.

07:53.020 --> 07:53.860
Oh, I like it.

07:53.900 --> 07:54.360
You did.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.940
But you tell me, oh, I said it's all about guns.

08:04.180 --> 08:08.020
Jason used his knowledge, his experience, and his determination.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.900
And always it started out in the novels.

08:11.160 --> 08:14.400
He would turn the tables by using this sort of thing.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.460
Is this kind of character traits that you admire?

08:16.940 --> 08:17.580
Not really.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.320
The Death World 2 and 3 came out by happenstance.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.680
It's just that the character was successful.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.780
I want to write another adventure-style book.

08:27.620 --> 08:30.320
And I realized after I wrote it, I left the ending open.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.300
You had to get these people off that planet.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.860
The certain part of them had to leave.

08:34.220 --> 08:35.260
They just go for killing things.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.620
You start thinking about it.

08:36.800 --> 08:37.960
And they're friends with his.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.260
And he's a weak man personally.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.060
And he has, like I say, he supplies a part.

08:43.140 --> 08:43.780
So they don't supply.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.760
They have the big bodies and the tiny poignant heads.

08:46.340 --> 08:49.160
He's a weakling in their terms, but he's a man of intelligence.

08:49.580 --> 08:52.200
So therefore, I said, gee, but if it was another planet,

08:52.280 --> 08:54.640
you had a problem, you'd have to go along and organize it.

08:54.820 --> 08:56.320
And then the plot developed.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.120
I did that once more.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.660
And that was the end of it, as far as I was concerned.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.220
People asked for another Death World.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.720
And no, I run that particular plot device.

09:05.180 --> 09:06.520
Well, I would pin into it.

09:06.820 --> 09:07.740
It worked three times.

09:07.740 --> 09:08.540
It worked pretty well.

09:09.180 --> 09:14.260
And I said, and OK, Death World 2, you may think it's about going off

09:14.760 --> 09:17.780
and blowing things up and killing things and rushing around.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.200
It really is.

09:19.240 --> 09:23.880
The entire book is about the difference in meaning between ethics and ethos.

09:24.420 --> 09:25.540
And that's what it's about.

09:26.260 --> 09:28.080
I keep repeating over and over through that thing.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.560
And a lot of guns go off.

09:29.660 --> 09:30.480
A lot of good things happen.

09:30.660 --> 09:31.640
You learn a bit of Esperanto.

09:32.320 --> 09:37.300
But also what science fiction can do, it's a book that takes the study

09:37.300 --> 09:40.100
of a philosophical question or a problem of meaning and meaning.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.280
Would you ever do another one first?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.420
None get tired of it.

09:46.620 --> 09:50.700
I did a short story for the Ken Memorial volume, which I edited.

09:51.340 --> 09:56.160
And then I did an even shorter story a year or two ago for a games magazine.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.560
They wanted to do a Death World game.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.460
And they had an idea of a rough plot.

10:00.540 --> 10:02.120
And I did a short story to go in the magazine.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.660
The game was designed around the story.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.240
But I feel no desire to.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.340
I mean, I don't have to.

10:06.860 --> 10:09.260
Luckily, at this stage in life, I can write the books I want to write.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.860
And I see nothing there.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.220
I mean, what you see is what you get.

10:12.380 --> 10:13.200
It's complete in the trilogy.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.100
Fine.

10:14.380 --> 10:18.160
End of step sideways and salute and step out.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.080
So it kind of summarized it.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.280
Yes, it was a trilogy.

10:21.580 --> 10:25.560
But when you wrote Death World itself, you didn't necessarily have that in mind.

10:25.740 --> 10:26.680
No, I wrote a book.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.960
After I finished it, I realized I let an ambiguous ending to it in one sense.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.940
A lot of your characters couldn't go on living unless they left that planet.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.060
That thought in mind.

10:34.160 --> 10:34.740
Another planet.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.160
Having finished that, I can see one more story with the same group of characters.

10:38.760 --> 10:39.580
Did that.

10:39.900 --> 10:40.440
And that was the end.

10:42.980 --> 10:50.680
OK, the other than the other famous hero from that time was the stainless steel rat, which

10:50.680 --> 10:52.220
is now a pentology.

10:52.460 --> 10:52.860
I can say that.

10:53.040 --> 10:53.340
Yes.

10:54.360 --> 10:59.860
And then this is this is adventure science fiction, but it's it's satirical.

10:59.980 --> 11:00.760
It's a parody.

11:01.720 --> 11:07.940
So I guess at the same time you're writing adventure science fiction, you were writing

11:07.940 --> 11:09.740
parody adventure science fiction.

11:10.720 --> 11:11.680
Yeah, right.

11:12.020 --> 11:14.380
Well, the humor came.

11:14.660 --> 11:15.860
I remember the basic idea.

11:16.280 --> 11:21.920
It was just that as the old rat says that we have, you know, flesh and blood rats and

11:21.920 --> 11:24.760
wooden buildings will have stainless steel rats and concrete ones.

11:25.680 --> 11:33.580
It is basically a very old idea of the villain as hero.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.680
Turn the world eye's head.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.720
This is what you have in the saint who tends to pontificate a little bit too much.

11:40.300 --> 11:46.200
It's where you have a Rupert of Hensau and that prisoner of Zenda.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.720
You all love him better.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.600
We've done the goodie goodies for the job.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.200
It is if you're pardoned expression.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.760
My dear friend, King's the Ami said a pick a rest novel.

11:56.260 --> 11:57.000
And don't be ashamed.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.240
You understand that means I said, thanks, King's the Ami.

11:59.380 --> 12:00.000
And ran off to a dictionary.

12:00.760 --> 12:04.620
The pick a rest novel is just that villain as the hero is villain villain as hero.

12:05.500 --> 12:11.460
And when I realized that I was doing that I'd come onto a formula and I was trying to get humor into it as well.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.800
There was no humor in science fiction.

12:12.920 --> 12:13.720
There's nothing that I was doing.

12:13.860 --> 12:14.640
Anyone else alive.

12:16.160 --> 12:21.260
The character developed as he went along and I get clues back from Rear's about it.

12:21.620 --> 12:31.700
And then English reader told me he likes to read this thing because the hero does all the thing he wish he could do against society and gets away with it.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.300
You know, everyone hates bureaucracy.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.620
And I said, my God, you're right.

12:35.680 --> 12:40.360
I thought about in the very next rat book, the first chapter, nothing to do with the rest of the book.

12:40.460 --> 12:44.400
If you look at it, it's just something happens to his dear wife, Angelina, and the enemy has her.

12:44.440 --> 12:44.920
And he goes off.

12:45.220 --> 12:51.100
The enemy is the internal review service, the old IRS man, you know, he goes and burns on all income tax records for the whole planet.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.380
Sharing everybody up, you know, and the story begins.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.900
But that's something we all wish could happen tomorrow except that people work for the IRS.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.640
And the seven of them got busted for selling dope in California.

13:02.020 --> 13:04.140
But it grew, it grew, let's say.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.560
What place does humor have in science fiction?

13:08.140 --> 13:08.720
Very little.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.260
It could have a bigger one.

13:11.860 --> 13:13.520
And the answer is a very mechanical one.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.740
Editors, for the most part, are dummies.

13:17.840 --> 13:22.560
And even the few bright ones have their own particular taste in humor.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.940
That is a matter of taste.

13:24.520 --> 13:29.100
You bring an adventure novel in and it will say, yeah, well, Harry's unbetter, but it's moved along.

13:29.100 --> 13:29.680
People are killed.

13:29.920 --> 13:30.460
I'll buy it.

13:30.860 --> 13:34.780
Bring a love story and oh, well, you know, girl gets kissed, you know, it's a little boring, but I'll buy it.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.240
You're bringing a humor novel.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.540
Doesn't laugh.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.500
He does not buy it.

13:40.500 --> 13:44.420
And if they laugh, I've heard them say, I wanted them to reject it was too funny.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.780
They're afraid the readers won't laugh.

13:47.380 --> 13:49.800
So the only way you can sell humor is have a reputation as a humor writer.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.740
And how do you get a humor writer?

13:51.840 --> 13:53.280
You've got to sell a book, but you can't sell it.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.760
It's a catch-tweeting two thing.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.080
And I snuck it in the stay-in-steel rat.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.500
I would make each one funny than the one before.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.900
And eventually the editor was laughing, Rears were laughing.

14:02.060 --> 14:03.340
Hurrah, I'm a humor writer.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.240
Slipper, Jim DeGrees.

14:07.940 --> 14:08.460
DeGrees?

14:08.920 --> 14:09.060
DeGrees?

14:09.220 --> 14:10.160
You got it right first time.

14:10.360 --> 14:10.660
Okay.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.400
Was another memorable character.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.600
So I'll ask kind of the same question again.

14:16.220 --> 14:21.300
Did you think of him first or the idea of the stainless steel rat and then build a character around that?

14:21.900 --> 14:26.120
How do the mechanics of how characters surface and are fleshed out?

14:26.120 --> 14:28.120
How do the character...

14:28.640 --> 14:30.500
Wait, hold the answer for a second.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.140
For a fact, dear?

14:32.940 --> 14:33.980
Okay, I'll wait until the door slams.

14:34.080 --> 14:34.880
I might include it again.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.480
All right.

14:42.100 --> 14:47.060
In science fiction, science fiction is not a character-based form of fiction.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.020
You can have three-dimensional characters in science fiction.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.180
But the idea comes first.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.280
It's an idea fiction.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.660
To form a fiction, we can have the idea as a hero.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.040
The main thing that has that is what you call three-dimensional.

15:01.120 --> 15:04.060
Have the idea for a character who would do these things.

15:06.040 --> 15:13.080
Which means far too often in science fiction, you'll get two-dimensional characters who just act the assigned role of the plot given to the by the author.

15:13.720 --> 15:14.980
And we don't mind reading that.

15:15.080 --> 15:22.020
We really want to read about the action to make good science fiction, viable, interesting, fun science fiction,

15:22.020 --> 15:26.780
when you have to assign the character the role, you must build his character as a character.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.900
That's where the art comes in.

15:28.980 --> 15:30.460
There are two things in all kinds of fictions.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.800
The craft of science fiction, constructing your plot.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.040
The art of science fiction is making your characters three-dimensional.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.060
Which is true for any character I write.

15:39.800 --> 15:44.400
I very rarely in science fiction do you have character-based fiction.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.660
If you have it, you should not science fiction.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.380
Okay, that brings us to Bill.

15:49.000 --> 15:49.780
Bill, go ahead.

15:49.780 --> 15:51.580
He was a dummy.

15:52.140 --> 15:54.000
He grew up in a high.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.060
It's an unmitigated spoof.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.500
Yeah, well, Bill would like to hear.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.040
There again, he was assigned the role.

16:01.240 --> 16:05.600
He was a good soldier, Shfaq.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.260
He's the guy who gets it in the neck all the time.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.120
And it had to be a science fiction army.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.920
And I think it just makes it explode in me.

16:14.220 --> 16:18.040
Having been in the army and seated here in the heart of the military,

16:19.060 --> 16:20.400
I'm an enlisted man.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.340
I have the highest rank in the army, that of a sergeant.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.240
You have to get to general before you get anything higher than that.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.620
Second lieutenant, you know, like grubs to be walked on.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.100
And the whole different attitude.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.460
And the officers like the military.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.840
They like to tell people what to do.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.720
And usually, what they tell them to do is not for the good of the people they're talking to.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.320
They should get killed for it.

16:41.100 --> 16:41.620
We're right.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.440
But the enlisted men want to stay alive.

16:44.100 --> 16:48.480
As the Osirians said in catch 22, they're trying to kill me.

16:48.880 --> 16:49.580
He didn't mean the enemy.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.800
He meant the army he was in.

16:51.660 --> 16:54.440
And knowing all this, reading all this, catch 22 came out.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.260
I was a great fan of Kandy.

16:57.060 --> 17:00.780
And when I saw catch 22, what he did, the Heller did,

17:01.420 --> 17:08.020
he showed that there's some things so awful that you have to laugh at them to understand them.

17:08.540 --> 17:11.780
If you do a military novel, you say, blood, blood, death, and testines in the trees.

17:11.780 --> 17:15.460
By the 20th time you hang the testines from the trees, you're tired looking at them.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.760
It looks like spaghetti after a while.

17:17.660 --> 17:19.220
Repetition of horror doesn't make horror.

17:19.780 --> 17:20.500
And that's all you can do.

17:20.580 --> 17:23.120
The army is utterly horrible, boring and wasteful.

17:23.260 --> 17:24.920
The military life is boring and wasteful.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.760
And in there, I parodied a few other novels just for fun of it.

17:32.080 --> 17:37.080
But the thing that goes right through it is understanding the military.

17:38.660 --> 17:42.780
Usually I discovered that I had a Korean war veteran come up to me,

17:42.840 --> 17:45.780
he's a combat marine, wouldn't have his face all shut away.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.600
And he said, you're a Korean horse.

17:48.800 --> 17:49.500
I said, yes, yes.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.860
He said, you wrote Bill the Glanting Hero?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.820
I said, yes, looking for a chair to hide behind.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.380
He said, I've got a copy of every edition of that book.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.540
I carry it through to combat, you know.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.520
And that tells a story.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.600
Another guy was the same thing, John Paul.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.960
He was a real Green Beret, the kind that had a bangle.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.460
He worked with the Montagnards, not like John Wayne with the fake one.

18:11.540 --> 18:14.500
He was up there and he killed him, a great killing.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.080
And Napoleon's troops carried a marshals baton in their pack.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.820
He carried a copy of Bill the Glanting Hero, all through the Korean War up there.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.660
Killing gooks and everything.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.600
And he used to get his rookies in.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.940
He read him a chapter every night whether they liked it or not.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.580
He'd break them in half, you know.

18:33.580 --> 18:38.700
And then, so, I really feel that it's humor and parody and a lot of fun.

18:38.960 --> 18:43.440
But it tells you something about the military condition that is absolutely dead true.

18:44.280 --> 18:50.260
It's funny, my next question is, Bill the Glanting Hero is a slap at making war in the military.

18:51.480 --> 18:52.840
Is this what you feel?

18:53.520 --> 18:56.780
Yeah, I said, you also got in some links at the bureaucracy.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.560
Yeah, so all that was answered.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.400
And that, isn't it?

19:01.980 --> 19:07.640
Yeah, and you spoofed the pulp, the old science fiction pulp traditions.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.400
There was a lot of trant or...

19:10.400 --> 19:11.860
Yeah, a lot of... that's right.

19:15.400 --> 19:19.980
The pro-military novel is like Starship Trooper, you know, where everyone's been kind to each other.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.300
In fact, I saw Norman Spinner put it in the article the other week.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.680
As Harry Harrison said, Bill Glanting is always Bob your buddy week.

19:29.460 --> 19:33.900
And this was, we said in the army, in a novel whose name I shall not mention,

19:34.400 --> 19:36.020
the guy in the heavy space armor is going down.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.860
All friends come to rescue him, you know.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.220
And in Bill, the guy goes in the swamp, the soldiers are marching by.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.240
He says, help me, help me.

19:43.260 --> 19:44.000
And they walk on by.

19:44.140 --> 19:46.560
He says, Bob your buddy week.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.620
And they say it's always Bob your buddy week.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.080
And that's what he's saying in the army, you know.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.740
I mean, it always is.

19:54.960 --> 19:55.880
It's every man for himself.

19:57.640 --> 19:58.700
Normally, normally.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.980
You expect to get it put in broken off and usually does.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.040
There's some references in there.

20:06.120 --> 20:09.900
I wonder in several generations from now how they'll stand up.

20:10.020 --> 20:13.140
I know the ship he was on was the Christine Wheeler.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.860
And who's going to know what that means, you know?

20:15.860 --> 20:20.840
Yeah, well, I should revise versions of that every 10 years, you know.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.480
But there was the good ship Trotsky.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.300
That'll stand.

20:24.600 --> 20:29.420
I mean, I also, the British edition, the Golden Thread, the use of Christine Heeler,

20:29.500 --> 20:30.600
had to change it to Fanny Hill.

20:30.940 --> 20:34.120
So much for, so did the publishers.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.280
Okay.

20:38.220 --> 20:42.520
Make room, make room, which is probably your serious novel,

20:42.800 --> 20:44.480
the one that you're known for, that sort of thing.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.360
And the topic was overpopulation.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.500
And you obviously, when I read it, you obviously felt very strong about population

20:51.500 --> 20:52.880
and yet you didn't preach.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.920
How did you walk that thing line?

20:56.140 --> 20:57.540
And you must feel.

20:57.660 --> 20:58.080
Okay.

20:58.180 --> 21:02.380
Science fiction tends to preach and tell you things, you know.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.740
It goes back to the old pups when you wanted to say,

21:05.060 --> 21:08.320
you should tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them and tell them you told them.

21:08.860 --> 21:12.700
And all the early science fiction, they go into time machine

21:12.700 --> 21:16.660
and there'll be the young assistant or a young girl, young guy, and he said,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.980
tell me professor, how does it work?

21:19.560 --> 21:22.060
Two and a half pages later, you learn how it works, you know.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.500
Which I put the boot in the technical time machine.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.440
I have the same thing happen.

21:28.500 --> 21:32.040
And the guy says, gee, professor, how does the time machine work?

21:32.720 --> 21:35.120
And the professor says, you're too stupid to understand.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.080
And I thought, a good explanation, you know.

21:39.340 --> 21:43.320
Science fiction has a auditory finger, tells you what to do and how to do it.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.080
And I felt very serious about population.

21:45.420 --> 21:48.860
At that time, I wrote the book, there were no fictional works on population.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.680
There were no, these popular nonfiction books hadn't come out.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.740
The world was completely unaware where we were going.

21:54.340 --> 21:55.060
And I could see it.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.420
I lived in Mexico and watched what was happening.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.760
You read the Learned Journalist, he told you about it.

21:59.120 --> 22:03.040
So I wanted to do a propaganda work that was disguised as not being propaganda.

22:04.020 --> 22:07.240
And so I said it in the year 1999 in New York.

22:07.900 --> 22:11.880
It makes a millennial novel, brings a lot of overtones, you know, the millennium,

22:12.140 --> 22:13.440
coming of Christ and the sort of thing.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.980
And I didn't want to lecture.

22:16.700 --> 22:20.020
So I very simply started a book, put the characters in the world,

22:20.080 --> 22:21.940
went along for almost a fifth of the book,

22:23.100 --> 22:28.120
and got everyone involved before someone turned to one character, the older character.

22:28.420 --> 22:30.060
How did the world get this way?

22:30.060 --> 22:34.300
At this point, I felt the reader was trapped enough to take one page of the lecture.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.200
And I sent the book in my hand and said,

22:36.260 --> 22:38.180
Harry, they're trapped up, take four pages of the lecture.

22:38.700 --> 22:42.960
So I just put in four pages, copy about a thousand words, two pages in the book,

22:43.440 --> 22:45.460
telling you how the world got that way.

22:45.500 --> 22:49.380
So my one little lecture right there, having done that little lecture,

22:50.060 --> 22:52.860
so it was in a sense a work of propaganda and art.

22:53.260 --> 22:54.520
If you have better art, better propaganda.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.320
1984 is propaganda.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.400
On the beach is propaganda.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.280
Both art, you get the message.

23:00.740 --> 23:01.340
And that was it.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.520
And after that, I worked around the point.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.220
And if you were alive and warm, you understood it.

23:05.860 --> 23:06.580
And the readers did.

23:09.080 --> 23:09.520
Okay.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.920
Yeah, I have to come in here.

23:14.020 --> 23:18.660
The shortages of materials, water, food, electricity were all made very real by the text.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.660
You weren't lecturing.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.960
It was just obvious and the reader could picture it.

23:22.980 --> 23:27.200
And I thought maybe that might harken back to your artist days about how you visualize things.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.560
As I think, having worked as an artist for a number of years,

23:32.140 --> 23:34.880
I see in my mind when I'm writing, I have a stage of people walking around.

23:35.020 --> 23:36.420
And I see what's in the background, the foreground.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.440
I hear the waves splashing and see them splashing.

23:41.520 --> 23:47.340
And as always in writing, you should never tell you should show.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.840
And good writing is hard work.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.180
It should be transparent.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.080
The reader should not see how you got the effect.

23:55.460 --> 24:00.340
And one of the best ways, of course, it's hard to do is never say the world is full of a lot of people.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.760
Never say you're short of water.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.220
Show them online to get water out of a standpipe.

24:05.540 --> 24:09.080
And then you know you're short of water and dramatize a need for the water.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.080
And this is where your art comes in.

24:14.580 --> 24:19.220
Which, for a lot of people, if the writer cannot do that, then he's not,

24:19.320 --> 24:20.480
that doesn't succeed on that level.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.000
If you read his book for fun, you know,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.800
if you get the reader emotionally involved, get him trapped into the book.

24:26.220 --> 24:29.180
And he comes out again, maybe not agreeing with you,

24:29.340 --> 24:30.520
but at least he knows what you're said.

24:30.620 --> 24:31.640
He'll be thinking about it.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.020
And I had one girl read that book in New York.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.240
She said, if I thought the world would be like that, I commit suicide.

24:36.340 --> 24:37.320
I said, don't, don't.

24:38.060 --> 24:42.700
The actor thinking that means you're going to vote right and work for this world will not appeal.

24:43.160 --> 24:46.780
That's a science fiction admonishing finger again saying, shape up or ship out.

24:47.140 --> 24:48.260
If you don't do this, you'll get that.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.260
I also view this as a detective novel.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.120
Is that fair?

24:54.120 --> 24:54.520
It's fair.

24:55.540 --> 24:59.160
All science fiction, for the most part, is based on detective plot.

24:59.820 --> 25:00.240
It's a mystery.

25:00.420 --> 25:00.980
Will it be solved?

25:01.820 --> 25:05.320
Even if they're not called like Hell, Clemens, Needle, not officially a mystery,

25:05.960 --> 25:07.360
you want to find out how you got that way.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.280
Will they solve the problem?

25:08.420 --> 25:09.120
Will they all live?

25:09.180 --> 25:09.960
Will they get all this world?

25:10.320 --> 25:10.940
Will they do it?

25:11.300 --> 25:15.540
Now that was the deliberate bit of my plot, a plot device of mine

25:15.540 --> 25:19.420
that I wanted to show society from the lowest levels to the high.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.640
I wanted to show how everybody lived in that world.

25:22.100 --> 25:24.660
So I use a very simple device of having a detective as protagonist.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.340
And a very simple story.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.580
And we all know from the beginning who did the murder.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.340
I mean, we knew what's going to happen.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.040
And it was not important, but it was a device to move the story along.

25:34.380 --> 25:37.180
And like most crimes in New York, 9% aren't solved.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.080
It's just by chance that they are.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.320
This is a way of getting you into the various levels of the strategy of society.

25:45.540 --> 25:48.420
I got to ask you then, they made a movie out of it.

25:48.520 --> 25:52.240
Call it Soil and Green, threw in some, made it cannibalism.

25:52.960 --> 25:57.880
Did you have anything to do with the screenplay or any input,

25:58.060 --> 26:02.040
or was that just, you just had to watch your baby get changed?

26:02.380 --> 26:06.620
First time I heard about the fact that they wanted to make a film out of this book

26:06.620 --> 26:09.320
was when I approached for a contract and I signed it.

26:09.820 --> 26:13.300
And then it turned out the firm that bought it was a front for MGM.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.160
And they sold MGM for $1.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.540
They hate to pay the writer a decent fee.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.000
For some reason, they pay everyone else.

26:19.060 --> 26:20.320
They don't like to pay writers in Hollywood.

26:20.920 --> 26:28.340
And it turned out that the producer Walter Zelzer and lead actor Chuck Heston

26:28.340 --> 26:30.660
have been trying to sell MGM for five years.

26:31.440 --> 26:35.960
And they couldn't sell MGM thought that overpopulation wasn't important enough to a film on.

26:36.560 --> 26:40.600
So they then got a moronic screenwriter who put in the cannibalism.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.100
He thought they'd eat that up in MGM.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.460
And they did. They thought it'd be a great idea for a film.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.480
So it was bought as a cannibalism film.

26:48.580 --> 26:51.320
And I saw the screenplay and it was pretty atrocious.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.520
And I could not do anything.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.780
By contract I couldn't change one word.

26:55.380 --> 26:59.540
So what I did do, I kept saying in memos what was wrong physically, how it could not work.

27:00.020 --> 27:00.960
And they made a lot of changes.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.100
I went down the set and pointed out things that hadn't been done.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.600
And I gave copies of the book to all the actors and all the technical people

27:07.600 --> 27:08.540
and they got very interested.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.700
And I talked to Eddie Robinson.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.660
I remember he talked to Dick Fleischer.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.940
I heard him say, I don't understand who I'm supposed to be. What is this role?

27:19.740 --> 27:22.140
And there's no way to like in that rotten screenplay what it was.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.340
So I asked if I could talk to him. I deduced myself.

27:25.900 --> 27:26.800
And we had lunch.

27:27.300 --> 27:28.740
I said, I wrote the book. Oh, it's very interesting.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.420
The Literate Man, Art Collector, you know.

27:30.920 --> 27:36.740
I explained that in the book in the year 2000, that is me.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.880
My army record, my age.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.720
The hero there, nothing.

27:40.800 --> 27:44.880
The old man is the only person who knew the good world as he was playing.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.360
He said, the only person who lived when the world was green.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.540
He said, that's a good idea. That's not bad.

27:50.060 --> 27:53.360
Having got that much, he went away and acted.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.420
A lot of that was created on camera.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.500
The interface between the director and the actors.

27:58.980 --> 28:01.020
And I like to think myself. That was there all the time.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.680
And I like to feel, A, it was my book.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.940
And B, if there was some worth in the film, I helped to add to it.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.880
So you were the, I can't remember his name.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.320
The character.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.860
Oh, I forget myself.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.900
Yeah, the old man, Saul.

28:17.320 --> 28:17.480
Yeah.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.100
So you were him.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.280
That's what, in a sense it was.

28:21.460 --> 28:24.620
I guess to keep him as a three-dimensional character, I just used myself when I was at that age.

28:24.820 --> 28:26.040
I don't want to live in that world.

28:26.180 --> 28:26.880
That's why I wrote the book.

28:27.020 --> 28:28.900
I do not want to be that person at that time.

28:30.140 --> 28:34.740
And there again, the technical people were so tremendous and the acting was so good.

28:34.740 --> 28:38.300
And it does what science fiction does so well.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.080
Background as foreground.

28:40.660 --> 28:42.680
You go to see it's a stupid little detective plot.

28:42.780 --> 28:44.640
And you know it's going to be bodies made in the sun and green.

28:45.180 --> 28:49.120
And then about a week later, you start thinking about that horrible world, that green world you're living in.

28:49.380 --> 28:50.040
My God.

28:50.460 --> 28:51.620
And then succeeding that plane.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.720
It was sort of a shocker and emotional shocker.

28:54.980 --> 28:55.340
It worked.

28:55.460 --> 28:56.700
I think it works pretty well as a film.

28:57.000 --> 28:57.780
There have been no complaints.

28:58.440 --> 29:00.320
It's the only film MGM made money on that year.

29:00.320 --> 29:05.080
It tells you you have the Great Walls bomb that cost 14 million and grossed 500,000.

29:05.500 --> 29:08.680
So MGM should be happy and Reston should be happy.

29:08.860 --> 29:09.540
I can't complain.

29:10.760 --> 29:11.200
Okay.

29:11.340 --> 29:14.980
The last two books we've talked about in Make Room, Make Room and Dill with the Hero.

29:16.260 --> 29:23.320
Bill with the War Mongering, Human Race and Make Room, Make Room with the Overpopulation.

29:23.460 --> 29:26.780
It's kind of a grim pessimistic future and it says something about human nature.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.840
Is that human nature?

29:28.840 --> 29:31.060
I'm sure you think that's what it would be careful or that's us.

29:31.240 --> 29:31.380
Yeah.

29:31.820 --> 29:33.680
Well, human nature is human nature.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.860
You can't guess what it is.

29:35.980 --> 29:37.440
It's there for you to see.

29:38.900 --> 29:41.320
And I like to talk about and think about it.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.480
I like to see where it might be going.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.720
I like to think about it.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.020
And sometimes it's very grim.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.360
Sometimes it's very funny.

29:47.540 --> 29:48.460
I write the funny books.

29:48.580 --> 29:50.240
I cheer myself up between Ryan and the grim books.

29:50.780 --> 29:52.800
And I thought that many grim books when you get down to it.

29:52.800 --> 29:58.580
Make Room, Make Room is about population and how we're destroying our planet through stupidly

29:59.680 --> 30:02.520
with the presidents involved in destroying the planet.

30:02.720 --> 30:07.000
You know, destroying our heritage, spaceship earth, or logical arguments which are being

30:07.000 --> 30:08.340
ignored by those in control.

30:08.780 --> 30:10.220
And then I'm anti-war.

30:10.340 --> 30:15.160
And that's about it as far as the deep thought books go.

30:15.460 --> 30:16.780
They're two big, deep things.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.760
You'll find these things reoccurring in other books.

30:21.380 --> 30:24.060
But they're two very, I think, very obvious and simple things.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.100
It can't be said too often.

30:25.940 --> 30:28.920
I'm like, Gans warm for keeping what we've got.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.200
That's not too bad.

30:30.540 --> 30:33.580
They just elected a party in Germany, the Green Party, on the basis of just that much.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.560
They got 5% of the votes?

30:37.020 --> 30:42.660
They had enough of the vote, around 5% to get 25 people in the Bundage done.

30:44.360 --> 30:44.840
Okay.

30:45.500 --> 30:52.500
To kind of just get to hit on some of the other fiction, Planet of No Return was fairly recently.

30:52.760 --> 30:55.020
It was a sequel to Planet of the Damned.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.500
Is that something you thought about doing?

30:56.740 --> 30:57.260
No, no.

30:57.520 --> 31:02.340
The exorcism of publishing produced strange offspring.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.740
I wrote Planet of the Damned years ago.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.400
In a way, it's death row one more time.

31:09.400 --> 31:10.480
There's slight differences.

31:10.860 --> 31:12.600
In fact, I wrote death row five or six times.

31:12.660 --> 31:16.040
One guy's another until I decided to break out and do Billy Glad to your hero.

31:16.940 --> 31:17.960
I did that.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.160
It was completely into itself.

31:20.360 --> 31:27.140
Then a few years ago, publisher were doing these illustrated books, which really are just juveniles.

31:27.260 --> 31:27.720
This is what they are.

31:27.980 --> 31:30.780
They're a really short novel with pictures in them for kids.

31:32.900 --> 31:35.540
Unlike Most Science for Can Rise, I ran out of money at the time.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.240
He said, how are you doing illustrating a book for me?

31:38.300 --> 31:38.780
I said, no.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.400
He said, we'll give you the X number of thousand dollars.

31:40.460 --> 31:41.080
I said, yes.

31:43.900 --> 31:46.100
I shopped around my older books and I saw I could do a sequel.

31:46.660 --> 31:49.700
We have Fast Pace Adventure Book with a little content as well.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.520
There's a little bit about women's rights in there.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.200
If you look closely at the end, they're all male fascists.

31:55.600 --> 31:56.080
Why are these guys?

31:56.160 --> 31:57.080
I'd love to kill each other.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.300
A little bit of plot, mystery plot.

31:59.380 --> 32:00.240
It's an option for a film.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.580
We make a nice, fast film.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.700
It was not a bad book.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.280
It's a juvenile, done for a certain market.

32:05.760 --> 32:06.820
Not ashamed of it or proud of it.

32:06.820 --> 32:08.340
It's just a book I did and there it is.

32:11.740 --> 32:15.300
I've kind of grouped you into a tent and color time machine, Star Smash, The Galaxy

32:15.300 --> 32:16.500
or Rangers, Tunnel Through the Deep.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.360
Those are humorous books.

32:19.560 --> 32:22.620
You apparently interspersed them with your serious books for the reasons you don't.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.840
I don't really set out to alternate books.

32:27.380 --> 32:30.020
It's just many times you have to thrust upon you.

32:30.640 --> 32:35.140
In a technical time machine, I can plot a very, very serious book.

32:36.000 --> 32:36.580
Time travel.

32:37.120 --> 32:42.900
And when I got this paparazzo tang camera and back facing this great, big, nine foot tall

32:42.900 --> 32:44.180
flying, I started to laugh.

32:44.740 --> 32:45.820
And it came out funny.

32:46.120 --> 32:49.820
But if you look there, it's a very solid time travel plot, which could be a serious book.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.600
Except I suddenly realized I started laughing and I'm laughing.

32:52.780 --> 32:55.020
Why shouldn't the readers laugh and the way the thing went.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.000
It took off that way.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.460
And I think it had that serious structure beneath it.

33:00.820 --> 33:02.340
Star Smash or The Galaxy or Rangers.

33:02.760 --> 33:06.320
I was feeling a deadly mood one day and I was so tired of rubbish.

33:06.900 --> 33:07.440
So tired.

33:08.080 --> 33:14.540
You know, Daryl Doc Smith wrote his Space Hoppers back in the 30s and 40s.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.520
That's a long time ago.

33:16.100 --> 33:18.600
And the period form of art, I think, is dead.

33:19.120 --> 33:24.000
But I keep seeing certain writers who shall be nameless rehashing old Space Hoppers.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.220
I said, oh, I've had enough of this.

33:26.500 --> 33:30.880
So I said, why not just put the boot to all the Space Hoppers one time, have fun doing

33:30.880 --> 33:31.120
it.

33:31.660 --> 33:34.540
And I made internal parodies of everyone I could think of.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.380
People accused me of hating Doc Smith.

33:36.560 --> 33:37.860
No, I don't like, I love Docs.

33:37.920 --> 33:38.920
Like, Roop-Ring Doc Smith.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.180
But I just don't, I think the feel is dead.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.000
I'd like to put a tombstone over it.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.060
Not that you ever can in fiction.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.360
There's still going on doing it anyway.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.620
But I enjoy myself.

33:46.760 --> 33:47.460
The reeds enjoy it.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.260
Some, I mean, the two kind of reeds.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.160
Some say you're hating Doc Smith.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.280
You know, they chase me around.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.000
And they say, huh, I feel a whole bunch of them.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.820
You know, so there it is.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.140
It takes your choice.

33:59.400 --> 33:59.840
Okay.

34:00.340 --> 34:05.600
I, the series I read before we came here was the To the Stars series.

34:05.860 --> 34:07.860
I don't know if that's your name for it or not.

34:08.160 --> 34:08.880
Yeah, that's my name.

34:09.040 --> 34:09.060
Yeah.

34:09.860 --> 34:14.300
I thought, well, I personally thought the covers on the American editions were terrible.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.480
I didn't show a damn thing.

34:15.920 --> 34:16.920
The guy with the guns.

34:17.300 --> 34:17.520
Yes.

34:18.360 --> 34:21.240
I kind of liked it because it gave you the first book.

34:21.320 --> 34:26.840
Here's this guy and this, he's this Urbane sophisticated man and a man about the world, the rich.

34:27.140 --> 34:29.880
And then it's, then the next novel is an adventure novel.

34:30.100 --> 34:33.340
And then it kind of is a hybrid third one.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.760
And I kind of enjoyed that because you kind of got to show all your facets.

34:37.920 --> 34:38.980
Even some humor.

34:39.920 --> 34:40.440
A bit, a bit.

34:40.660 --> 34:41.240
A Star Wars thing.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.020
We were talking about this morning.

34:42.260 --> 34:43.380
A touch, a touch here and there.

34:43.640 --> 34:44.380
Yeah.

34:44.520 --> 34:51.280
That, that book, it comes about, came about, that the trilogy came about through the inability

34:51.280 --> 34:53.800
I have to just to take the situation as set.

34:55.080 --> 34:58.800
I can, I know what I got the idea from when I was in California on the freeway with my

34:58.800 --> 34:59.700
friend Brian, all this.

35:00.040 --> 35:03.080
We were in a horrible little English Sprite, which is about eight inches high and two feet

35:03.080 --> 35:03.560
wide.

35:03.980 --> 35:05.900
And it goes a maximum of 50 miles an hour.

35:06.260 --> 35:12.040
And we're trumbling along five lane freeway, California five, great big articulated trucks

35:12.040 --> 35:14.580
with trails going by 14 foot high wheels.

35:14.840 --> 35:18.100
I'm looking at the bottom of hubcaps, you know, trying to keep the thing going straight.

35:18.920 --> 35:24.140
I had a vision of that point of a world where trucks ran forever on and on and on, through

35:24.140 --> 35:24.960
around the whole plan.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.520
How can we do that?

35:26.980 --> 35:29.880
So I had to develop a whole plan and a culture to get them there.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.640
And by the time I'd done it and written the book, the editor said, I feel it's incomplete.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.840
How did they get there in the first place?

35:36.080 --> 35:37.620
And what happened that revolution afterwards?

35:37.800 --> 35:38.360
I said, you're right.

35:38.420 --> 35:39.560
I got so much plotting in here.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.820
I have a whole book before and a book afterwards.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.320
So I took the character.

35:43.440 --> 35:47.780
He ride this plan for nameless reasons and it ended with the revolution, which is going

35:47.780 --> 35:48.160
wrong.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.780
So I went back and told you how he got there.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.760
Took an earth and I closed the book together in the final one.

35:54.120 --> 35:54.680
They came out different.

35:54.940 --> 35:56.620
The one middle one was written first.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.640
They had to be a different aspect, you know, then the third one, of course, put the first

36:00.640 --> 36:01.100
two together.

36:01.460 --> 36:06.640
But as you said, I use different things at different times in their high technology and

36:06.640 --> 36:09.860
the enjoyment of technology and a little bit of politics.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.460
And the first one is some ways like a make room, make room.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.680
And so where are we going to go if we don't get a hold of technology and what we can do?

36:18.220 --> 36:24.600
If you know, I say the very, the first book is, shows you how rotten Britain will be 500

36:24.600 --> 36:25.320
years from now.

36:25.620 --> 36:31.400
The third book, how rotten America will be 500 years from now and all done for good intentions

36:32.040 --> 36:35.680
with lack of knowledge of how to go about taking care of helping people.

36:35.680 --> 36:37.340
And they're both rotten worlds.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.720
So there again, the administrative thing is being shaken.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.420
No, this is you.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.080
You must get technologies involved.

36:43.280 --> 36:47.980
You must do somehow, not guess, you must just somehow do a better job of ruling the world,

36:48.140 --> 36:53.880
you know, we're in a technological world and nobody in the British Parliament or the American

36:53.880 --> 36:56.880
Senate or legislation knows anything about science.

36:57.700 --> 37:01.320
I mean, we are a bunch of ex lawyers and politicians.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.320
Politicians have one motivation life.

37:04.320 --> 37:05.380
That's to get reelected.

37:05.540 --> 37:08.900
Look at the whole Nixon trouble came about because all he wanted to do would be reelected

37:08.900 --> 37:10.460
and doesn't care what you do.

37:10.580 --> 37:11.800
And that's the wrong thing.

37:11.900 --> 37:13.880
I'm not saying I can't see any easy answers to them.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.040
Just saying that there are answers.

37:15.420 --> 37:16.640
We are now a technology revolution.

37:16.820 --> 37:21.560
We now are going into the computer world and no one has consistently thought what will

37:21.560 --> 37:22.560
happen to most people.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.620
And in a way behind all the adventure stories, there is a consideration of those problems.

37:27.880 --> 37:33.300
The character, I almost thought was the strongest character in those, in that trilogy of the

37:33.300 --> 37:35.280
first last book was the brother-in-law again.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.360
His name escapes me.

37:36.460 --> 37:37.400
That's why I had a written name.

37:37.640 --> 37:37.920
Yes.

37:38.120 --> 37:39.300
The brother-in-law character.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.460
Did you have somebody in mind?

37:43.240 --> 37:44.040
Not really.

37:44.640 --> 37:49.040
A question you ask is the brother-in-law whose name I forget, the hyphen they are named George

37:49.040 --> 37:50.560
Barlington Stone or something.

37:52.240 --> 37:55.240
If you look closely, let me say I'm not pretending to be subtle.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.500
I'm saying that I am subtle.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.300
I'm saying if you examine these books, you'll find a couple of levels.

37:59.300 --> 38:07.020
The first book plot-wise and character-wise is a tip of the hat, another head to George

38:07.020 --> 38:07.960
Orwell's 1984.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.620
I even used the word, leader and for pint and they were his thing.

38:12.700 --> 38:13.960
They were drinking leaders instead of pints.

38:14.280 --> 38:15.180
I used the word, pros.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.200
I put the clues in there for you to find.

38:18.480 --> 38:28.120
And the brother-in-law character is the same torturer character from Brian O'Brien or Brian

38:28.120 --> 38:28.980
was the other fellow.

38:29.600 --> 38:34.080
It is the man who knows his evil and is in charge of an evil society.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.180
And that's why he's in the first book.

38:36.720 --> 38:41.120
But having not killed him off in the first, he has to appear again and then you get what

38:41.760 --> 38:44.920
I thought was the only truthful ending, the ambiguous ending to the third one.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.660
People hate me for what happened.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.140
I said, that's what life is.

38:48.700 --> 38:52.300
Science fiction gives you easy answers, but in real life there are no easy answers.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.520
That's what I really liked about it.

38:55.980 --> 38:57.060
It was not clear-cut.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.440
That is life.

38:58.580 --> 38:59.100
That is life.

39:00.920 --> 39:02.920
Okay, I want to talk to you a little bit then.

39:03.180 --> 39:05.260
You've also done a lot of editing.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.900
You slandered editors while ago.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.280
I slandered editors?

39:09.500 --> 39:10.200
That's right.

39:10.340 --> 39:15.340
Because having edited a number of pulp magazines and having edited 85 anthologies, I can knock

39:15.340 --> 39:15.700
editors.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.600
That's not an easy job, is it?

39:21.160 --> 39:22.620
It's not a hard job.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.120
It's easier than writing.

39:25.980 --> 39:33.360
A successful editor who actually doesn't just copy edit, an editor who purchases stories

39:33.360 --> 39:37.600
and prints them in the magazine or a book editor, has to have taste that matches the public.

39:38.260 --> 39:39.980
The skills attach are very minor.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.600
You can learn to copy edit and to correct.

39:43.940 --> 39:44.700
Not to correct.

39:45.940 --> 39:47.600
Two things good editors have.

39:47.780 --> 39:49.900
That is, their taste matches the public enough.

39:49.980 --> 39:51.060
What they buy, people will read.

39:51.340 --> 39:52.280
They're publishing how it succeeds.

39:53.200 --> 39:58.480
Secondly, better editors have editorial taste where they can take and tell a writer how

39:58.480 --> 40:00.600
he can improve his book or his short story.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.780
That's something that's like a skill like writing.

40:06.060 --> 40:07.280
They're not the same skill.

40:07.660 --> 40:08.520
Most editors can't write.

40:08.680 --> 40:09.500
Most writers can't edit.

40:10.340 --> 40:12.480
Just by chance, I haven't fallen into this.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.400
I enjoy a certain amount of editing.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.120
I think it helps my own writing.

40:18.260 --> 40:18.520
There again.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.420
I like to refer back to my own work.

40:20.420 --> 40:26.540
When I've done a draft of a book, I try very, very hard to step out of the role of author

40:26.540 --> 40:28.540
and look at that as an editor who isn't working.

40:29.220 --> 40:31.340
This is not common to me.

40:31.560 --> 40:36.400
I mean, how many ways, years ago, every good writer has an inborn automatic shit detector.

40:37.140 --> 40:38.040
You smell your manuscript.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.200
It smells bad.

40:39.320 --> 40:39.960
You throw it out.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.220
There again.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.580
It goes into making an author with a lot of different skills.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.000
If they all work, they work.

40:46.120 --> 40:46.960
They don't forget it.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.800
Apparently, the editor that edited Will Whirls said,

40:51.900 --> 40:53.460
hey, you needed beginning and an ending.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.000
They did you a service.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.480
So editors can.

40:56.780 --> 40:57.140
Can.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.240
Well, the girl said this.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.980
She said, I feel it's not complete.

41:01.120 --> 41:01.600
There's more to it.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.020
I can't expand it.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.100
There's no way.

41:04.720 --> 41:09.480
The second book, Will Whirls Complete Into Itself, begins where it has to begin and ends where it has to end.

41:10.540 --> 41:11.960
And started me thinking, yeah.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.600
So in a sense, good editor point out that.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.760
And but normally I would just said, no, it is a success.

41:20.040 --> 41:20.740
Succeeds where it is.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.880
But then again, I was in financial problems.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.580
So by God, I got trilogy here rather than one book.

41:26.120 --> 41:29.560
And two years later, I had three books instead of one, which helps.

41:29.700 --> 41:30.640
They package them nicely.

41:30.860 --> 41:34.940
They go three into one and works very well.

41:35.480 --> 41:36.980
Okay, we've talked before you ask the question.

41:37.140 --> 41:37.980
Let me see my wife.

41:41.960 --> 41:42.380
Yeah.
