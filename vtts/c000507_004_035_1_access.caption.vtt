00:01.360 --> 00:11.520
Now it's rolling. So let us commence without further ado. Would you please give
us a little bit of your background, how you grew up, how you got interested in

00:11.520 --> 00:22.080
science fiction, and why you write science fiction now? Well, actually, I
started reading science fiction kind of late compared to a lot of people because

00:22.080 --> 00:32.360
when I was growing up, well, I didn't know very much about science fiction. I'd
never read any of it to speak of, and about the first science fiction I ever

00:32.360 --> 00:46.420
read in depth was H.G. Wells, which I was reading because I was interested in
him, and I was also interested in writing a paper on him for a class I was

00:46.420 --> 00:56.380
taking in high school. So that was what got me started, and it wasn't until I
was in college that I really started reading a lot of science fiction and really

00:56.380 --> 01:06.300
found out how many writers there were. I thought that basically there was Aldous
Huxley or H.G. Wells and a few writers who would sort of do a science fictional

01:06.300 --> 01:11.680
or utopian or satirical kind of book, and I didn't really know about any of the
other stuff until a lot later.

01:14.460 --> 01:27.440
So I don't know if that answers your question. Yeah, that answers it fine. What
is your definition of science fiction? I don't really have one. I mean, I think

01:27.440 --> 01:36.620
it's pretty obvious what it is when you look at it, that it deals with times
other than the here and now, usually things in the future or in an alternate

01:36.620 --> 01:49.660
world or whatever. But I get very annoyed and very impatient with definitions
anyway. Unfortunately, I think a lot of what defines science fiction is that

01:49.660 --> 01:56.420
it's a publisher's category. Basically, the publishers are saying, well, this is
science fiction, we'll publish it as science fiction. It's a publisher's

01:56.420 --> 02:03.960
category. And I don't think writers really think of it quite as much as the
publishers do. I think most writers would probably rather that the books were

02:03.960 --> 02:13.860
just thought of as novels that just happened to be a little more distant from
present-day life than other kinds of books.

02:16.580 --> 02:26.820
Your background is in philosophy. Yeah. Was that a good discipline from which to
write science fiction? Probably. But I think that almost anything would be a

02:26.820 --> 02:38.640
good discipline from which to write science fiction, or anything else, probably.
I think what's useful about philosophy is that... I think... Oh, jeez, I'm

02:38.640 --> 02:52.080
stuttering. Maybe I better start this over again. Yeah, go right ahead. Okay. I
think the best thing about philosophy as a training is that it teaches you to

02:52.080 --> 03:02.480
sort out reasonable sorts of ideas or consistent sorts of ideas from things that
are just completely bizarre or ridiculous. That's probably one of the best

03:02.480 --> 03:11.180
things about it. And it's also the kind of thing that I don't think you can
study for very long unless you become interested in other things. Now, I know a

03:11.180 --> 03:20.300
lot of people nowadays who probably disagree with that because the trend in
philosophy has been towards the analytic school and the sort of thing that has

03:20.300 --> 03:28.920
almost no relation to anything, symbolic logic and that sort of thing, where it
becomes very, very abstract. That's been the trend. I was always sort of at odds

03:28.920 --> 03:38.180
with that because my interest was more in the history of philosophy and, in
particular, in ancient philosophy. I was taking Greek so that I could read the

03:38.180 --> 03:46.760
stuff properly, and I was a lot more interested in that kind of thing. That's
not the general trend of modern-day philosophy at all, But that was my interest,

03:46.800 --> 03:55.700
and that particular kind of thing I think is probably useful. At least I learned
how to do a lot of research because the kind of thing I was doing I had to, and

03:55.700 --> 04:06.680
it's always useful to know how to do research for writing science fiction. A
number of your works have biological themes as well as the anthologies you've

04:06.680 --> 04:20.060
edited. Do you have a latent interest in biology? Well, I probably do. I took a
special course in it when I was a kid, with a lot of other students who would

04:20.060 --> 04:29.960
pick to take a certain course, and I did pretty well in that. It was one of the
few sciences I did do well, and I took a little bit of it in college, although

04:29.960 --> 04:47.340
not very much. I suppose if I had gone into a science, that would have been the
one I would have gone into. So, that probably affected my topics for books. Were

04:47.340 --> 04:57.820
you ever tempted to stay in academia and teach philosophy? Well, I was thinking
of doing that. That was why I was in grad school, but it became pretty obvious

04:57.820 --> 05:07.660
after a while that there weren't going to be any jobs in the field, and that it
would have been years spent working towards the doctorate and then trying to

05:07.660 --> 05:16.060
find a job and probably not being able to find one. I have serious doubts as to
whether I could have found any kind of permanent job or any kind of reasonable

05:16.060 --> 05:26.740
job. I probably would have been one of those part-time migrating academics, and
that didn't exactly appeal to me, I have to admit. But I have thought of going

05:26.740 --> 05:35.960
into it. There seems to be even less government support for the social sciences
now than there ever was And, of course, when you were in school, it wasn't all

05:35.960 --> 05:45.440
that good anyway I would tend to think that's kind of an alarming trend Yes, it
is I mean, you know, in my case, I don't really feel that bad about it Looking

05:45.440 --> 05:55.900
back at it, I don't suppose I ever would have been a terrific philosopher to
begin with I probably would have been second rate But as far as the people who

05:55.900 --> 06:04.380
are really gifted in this kind of thing, I think it's probably a tragedy. And it
may take 10 or 20 years before people see it and suddenly realize that there's

06:04.380 --> 06:15.760
no one around to teach certain things, that there's no one around to convey
certain kinds of knowledge and that something has been lost. So, that worries

06:15.760 --> 06:27.420
me. Yeah. Okay, let's start talking about some specific works then. You started
out in print with short stories, which were later collected in Star Shadows.

06:27.660 --> 06:38.140
Should beginning writers try to establish themselves by writing short stories
before they move on to something else? Well, that depends because one of the

06:38.140 --> 06:46.140
advantages of a short story, obviously, for a beginning writer, is that you can
start it and finish it and have some immediate reinforcements. You're more

06:46.140 --> 06:54.320
likely to be able to sit and sustain the effort to finish a short story, which
is hard enough to begin with. It's hard enough just to sit down and finish a

06:54.320 --> 07:02.820
story, let alone sit and write a novel and not know what's going to happen and
then not know what to do with the thing after you've finished it, wondering if

07:02.820 --> 07:13.620
anyone's even going to look at it, let alone buy it. And so in a practical
sense, it probably makes sense to start out with short stories. The trouble is,

07:13.820 --> 07:23.940
not everybody is a short story writer. Some writers are basically novelists. If
they try to start out by writing short stories, they may find that somehow the

07:23.940 --> 07:33.440
thing feels unfinished or that it's really not complete or that it's not really
what the particular writer wants to do. And in that case, I think, it might be

07:33.440 --> 07:43.220
better off to try writing a novel, even if it is harder, just to finish it, just
to know that you can sit there and finish it. But once you finish the first one,

07:43.420 --> 07:53.880
it doesn't guarantee you'll ever write another one, but it's a big step forward.
Just finish it, even if no one buys it. So I don't know. I think it depends on

07:53.880 --> 08:01.400
the particular writer. I think if you have a particular short story gift,
obviously it would help to start out writing short stories. It means if you

08:01.400 --> 08:10.600
present a book to an editor, you're not going to be a complete unknown. They
will have known that the writer has published something. But not everybody can

08:10.600 --> 08:19.360
do it. and there are some writers who have just simply gone right into novel
writing to begin with. Ben has gone all right at that, and never wrote short

08:19.360 --> 08:22.880
stories at all, or maybe wrote a couple after they had published novels.

08:26.780 --> 08:36.340
In your short story collection, Star Shadows, there were ten stories, and by my
reckoning, which is not guaranteed to be correct, seven of the ten of them

08:36.340 --> 08:48.820
involved relationships between couples, and the relationships range from pretty
abysmal ones to a pretty good one, like in If Ever I Should Leave You. This

08:48.820 --> 08:58.280
isn't a theme that's usually presented in science fiction stories. Did you
consciously put that in there? Is that your reason for writing the stories, to

08:58.280 --> 09:09.760
show such relationships? No, it really wasn't. It just turned out that way. It's
probably just because when I began to write a story or anything, I like to have

09:09.760 --> 09:11.560
an idea of a particular character.

09:14.520 --> 09:22.340
Usually the character begins... It sounds strange to put it this way, but
usually what happens is the character will begin to speak to me in some way.

09:22.820 --> 09:32.820
I'll begin to get a sense of who this person is. As I find out more about the
character, it's as if the character is telling me about her life or his life,

09:34.260 --> 09:44.220
what's going on in it, what kind of experiences they've had in their childhood
and so forth. And so if a relationship is in there, it may be, it's partly

09:44.220 --> 09:51.900
because it may have something to do with the theme of the story also, may
reflect the theme of the story in some cases. But it's also simply because as I

09:51.900 --> 10:01.740
write about a character, it's obvious that I'm going to be filling in certain
things about the character's life as I go along. I didn't consciously set out to

10:01.740 --> 10:11.200
say, well, I am going to write about relationships and the relationships will
reflect the theme of the story or mirror it or whatever. I'm afraid I'm not that

10:11.200 --> 10:20.900
conscious a writer. So it just turned out that way. If I write about couples or
relationships between couples, which I probably have a tendency to do, it's

10:20.900 --> 10:30.620
because that's more familiar to me than a lot of other things. Obviously, if I
weren't part of a couple, then I probably would be writing more about single

10:30.620 --> 10:44.080
people or about, you know, someone else. So that's probably it. The other
emotional theme that I saw in a lot of those stories was empathy, which is

10:44.080 --> 10:52.380
harder to define and harder to write about, I would think. I assume it came up
for the same reason. Yeah. Yeah, I think it did.

10:56.180 --> 11:04.960
One of the stories that really interested me in that collection was Gather Blue
Roses, which, again, if I'm right, it inspired at least two paperback covers. I

11:04.960 --> 11:15.420
saw some blue roses on Star Shadows and then the one on Wandering Stars. You've
made some comments in forwards and things that you have trouble with titles, so

11:15.420 --> 11:27.220
I'll ask you about that title. Where did Gather Blue Roses come from? Well, that
is a good question. I don't really know. I do know that it has it has something

11:27.220 --> 11:36.620
to do with a particular symbol of trying to forget and trying to forget things
and obviously the color blue has quite a lot to do with sadness and with tragedy

11:36.620 --> 11:48.240
which is what that story was about. It's a rather strange title for the story
probably but that's it, I got the title from someone else. I showed him the

11:48.240 --> 11:55.840
story and said I don't have any kind of title for this. I had a title for it
when I started out, which was abysmal, but I had to put something at the top of

11:55.840 --> 12:07.120
the page when I was writing it, so I put a god-awful title on the page and
showed it to another writer, and he was the one that gave me the title, so I

12:07.120 --> 12:15.720
don't have to assign the credit elsewhere. Is it true that it is difficult to
think of the good catchy titles that editors like and that readers want to read?

12:15.840 --> 12:25.220
Well, it probably isn't for some people, but it is for me. I sometimes wish that
there were a title writing workshop that I could go to so that I could come up

12:25.220 --> 12:34.080
with titles It is a real agony for me That is the worst thing about a story for
me sometimes It's just coming up with a title Now I've been lucky with a few

12:34.080 --> 12:42.580
I've written a few things for the title, naturally grew out of the story But
very often I don't have a title when I start I know that's strange because I've

12:42.580 --> 12:53.500
heard people say that That they always have to have a title before they start or
they can't proceed. I almost never have a title when I start. But occasionally

12:53.500 --> 12:57.620
I'm lucky and a few things have titles that are pretty obvious.

13:00.920 --> 13:12.040
OK, I now have a trivia question. Three stories that appeared in a row, Gather
Blue Roses, Oasis, and Julio 204, all written in 1971, had a character named

13:12.040 --> 13:24.120
Simon in them. Was this just coincidental? It probably was. It probably was
coincidental. I noticed it at the time myself, and about the only thing I can

13:24.120 --> 13:35.100
say about that is that I don't think I was particularly fixated on the name, but
it just seemed that that was the name of that particular character. And the fact

13:35.100 --> 13:43.560
that it occurred three times really is not important as far as I know. Maybe
somebody will do an analysis of it and find out that it is, but as far as I

13:43.560 --> 13:44.640
know, it has no meaning.

13:47.520 --> 13:58.420
The novel Cloned Lies is an expansion or a fusion of at least three short
stories that I could count. When you started writing the short stories, did you

13:58.420 --> 14:09.300
have the idea in the back of your head to go ahead and do a novel eventually?
Not really. Not really. The stories – when I wrote the first story – maybe I

14:09.300 --> 14:18.880
should start at the beginning. When I wrote the first story, I was writing more
of a particular anthology. Well, I wasn't really writing for this anthology, but

14:18.880 --> 14:28.060
as I was writing this story, an editor told me he might be interested in this
particular story. I wrote that. It occurred to me a few months later that I

14:28.060 --> 14:36.660
might want to use the same characters in another story, since I had become
interested in them when I wrote the first one, so I did that. And the whole

14:36.660 --> 14:47.160
thing grew from there. I didn't intend for it to be a novel, which may be a flaw
in the book, for all I know. I originally thought of just writing a couple of

14:47.160 --> 14:55.520
stories about these characters. Then I got more interested in them. Then I
thought maybe of writing a series of stories about them. And then the novel sort

14:55.520 --> 15:04.660
of grew from that. I had to search for a structure for the novel, which was a
little difficult to do since I had been writing it in pieces, starting in the

15:04.660 --> 15:16.400
middle, going to the beginning, moving towards the end. And to extract a
structure from that was a little difficult, But I wouldn't recommend it as a way

15:16.400 --> 15:25.920
to write a novel. It may be a good way to write a first novel because at least I
finished the damn thing. If I had started out saying I was going to write the

15:25.920 --> 15:30.780
book, I might never have gotten to the end. I might have been too intimidated by
the length.

15:34.340 --> 15:44.160
As in many of your short stories, your depiction of the future in Cloned Lives
is pretty grim. Does this reflect your own personal feelings about what we're

15:44.160 --> 15:52.620
doing now? Oh, I'm sure it does. I'm sure it does. I'm somewhat of a pessimist.

15:56.580 --> 16:05.020
When the clones were born, I was surprised that they were spanked. I would have
thought that they would have been born by Le Boye method or something like that.

16:05.260 --> 16:12.980
You know, now that I think of it, that probably would have been a better method
for them. I mean, given the fact that they were coming out of artificial wombs

16:12.980 --> 16:26.080
in the first place, which was probably traumatic enough, for all I know, that
probably would have been a gentler method. And now that I think of it, that's

16:26.080 --> 16:36.620
probably something, if I were writing it now, I might have done differently.
When I read it, I was particularly tuned in to Le Bois, and so that's kind of

16:36.620 --> 16:49.520
picky, I got to admit. No, it really isn't picky. I don't suppose I really
thought very much about that and about that particular method, although it seems

16:49.520 --> 16:57.480
to me it might actually have been difficult, because given the fact that they
were being born in a lab, given the fact that they were being born in a way that

16:57.480 --> 17:09.420
human beings haven't been born, I'm not sure how you would apply Leboe to them.
There's no mother for them to rest against to speak of. Although I suppose that

17:09.420 --> 17:12.300
maybe the people in the lab could have been a little gentler with them.

17:17.000 --> 17:26.100
Okay, your knowledge of children and the dynamics of sibling interaction came
through pretty strongly in this book. Did you grow up with brothers and sisters

17:26.100 --> 17:34.480
or have a lot of children around when you were growing up? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I
did grow up with brothers and sisters, and my little brother and sister, I often

17:34.480 --> 17:46.240
looked after my little brother and sister as a matter of fact. And I often
babysat, and I suppose that some of the ways in which the people in cloned lives

17:46.240 --> 17:56.920
interact with each other are partly some of the ways in which my family
interacted. I mean, one of the things I noticed, not when I was growing up, but

17:56.920 --> 18:10.320
sometime later, was that in a large family, I think everyone tends to stake out
his or her territory and each child sort of becomes an expert or takes over a

18:10.320 --> 18:20.960
certain thing that's theirs and that's not the other kids. You know, sort of
distinguish yourselves from one another. And when I was writing about the

18:20.960 --> 18:29.100
Swensons and Clone Wives, it didn't surprise me that they would try to do the
same thing. And as a matter of fact, I also had experience with twins because I

18:29.100 --> 18:40.380
have cousins who are twins and there are twins in my family. So it's a natural
thing, I think. Well, more so now than it used to be, especially for identical

18:40.380 --> 18:51.580
twins, to try to distinguish themselves from each other, to try to do things a
little differently so that each one sort of has his or her own identity. So

18:51.580 --> 19:01.140
there is probably some of that experience in the book. I thought the most
ambitious part of the book was the multiple points of view that you took. Each

19:01.140 --> 19:09.780
of the clones had a different characterization, and they were unique, and I
would think that would be pretty hard to pull off. Well, what's funny about that

19:09.780 --> 19:22.540
is, I suppose it probably seems as though it would be hard, but consider this. I
was a beginning novelist then, hadn't written a book before. I knew that writing

19:22.540 --> 19:30.720
from different points of view was certainly not something that a beginning
writer should probably tackle, but at the same time, I was writing about clones.

19:30.940 --> 19:42.580
So I was reasoning this way. I thought, well, if the points of view seem
similar, I can't get called on that or criticized for that because, after all,

19:42.580 --> 19:52.340
all the characters are clones of one another. So obviously there would be some
similarity. So I didn't have to worry quite as much as I might have if I were

19:52.340 --> 20:00.820
writing from the point of view of completely different people who were
unrelated. I think that's a much more difficult sort of thing. The fact that

20:00.820 --> 20:03.340
they were clones, I think, gave me a little more leeway there.

20:06.740 --> 20:17.080
Again, I harp on this, and I will continue harping on this. This was a people
novel. You dealt primarily with the feelings of the clones, the isolation they

20:17.080 --> 20:24.520
felt, how they felt different, that sort of thing. And that is different from
most science fiction that we read because it's generally the hardware that's

20:24.520 --> 20:33.240
concentrated on by the authors now. Well, I think that's true of a certain kind
of science fiction, but I think there's always been science fiction that's

20:33.240 --> 20:39.960
concentrated on the other things. Now, maybe my experience was a little
different, too, because the fact that I didn't start reading science fiction

20:39.960 --> 20:49.580
until later meant that the sorts of things I did read tended to concentrate on
people more. And it was actually a surprise to me when I found out that there

20:49.580 --> 20:59.620
were books that concentrated more on technology or engineering sorts of things.
And that just came as a surprise to me when I found out about it. I found out

20:59.620 --> 21:08.680
about it rather late. So it never occurred to me that novels wouldn't be about
people. I just had no experience with that. So when I started writing, I think

21:08.680 --> 21:17.380
it was a natural thing for me to start writing with that kind of attitude. I'd
always assumed that novels were essentially about people.

21:28.940 --> 21:29.380
Well,

21:34.120 --> 21:44.380
I think when I was writing CloneLives, I might have been a little more
pessimistic than I would be now. I mean, we've already seen test two babies. and

21:44.380 --> 21:52.560
though the world has not exactly gone rushing to the barricades or demanding
that this be stopped or anything, most people don't really seem to think that

21:52.560 --> 22:03.100
much about it. It seems reasonable to them that if someone can't have a child in
the normal way, that this kind of thing is really perfectly acceptable. Now, of

22:03.100 --> 22:11.480
course, there's a big difference between that kind of thing and cloning. I think
cloning presents a great many more problems that this kind of thing doesn't

22:11.480 --> 22:22.440
present. We haven't even gotten to the point of talking about artificial wombs
or any of this sort of stuff. And I think there are going to be a lot of

22:22.440 --> 22:30.780
important issues to resolve. At the same time, I'm no longer quite so sure that
people are going to become completely hysterical about it or that it's

22:30.780 --> 22:40.800
necessarily going to be bad or that it's necessarily going to damage us in some
way. Although I do think that as far as cloning in particular is concerned, and

22:40.800 --> 22:51.680
I'm not sure there's really any constructive reason for bothering with it. I
can't think of too many reasons to clone anyone. And one of the things that I

22:51.680 --> 23:00.820
tried to show in Clone Lives at least a little bit is that the notion of cloning
people thinking that they are going to be like the person they are cloned from

23:00.820 --> 23:10.100
is really an illusion. They're going to be themselves. They won't have the same
experience. They won't grow up the same way. They won't have the same

23:10.100 --> 23:14.680
environment. And that will create a certain kind of divergence.

23:17.920 --> 23:27.960
I'll make a prediction. The only people that will be interested in cloning are
going to be the professional sports teams. Possibly. Although even there, you

23:27.960 --> 23:38.240
can't be sure. You might clone someone. And, I mean, there are people who have
gone in for athletics very heavily and were very gifted at it, who, given other

23:38.240 --> 23:47.600
circumstances, might have done something else, but just didn't have those
circumstances. Maybe for them sports was a way out of the ghetto or a way out of

23:47.600 --> 23:59.960
poverty or a way to make a living or something that they loved, something that
they just had a real gift for. I'm not so sure that their children, even if they

23:59.960 --> 24:10.040
were clones or exactly the same, would go in for sports in the same way. I don't
think that's at all obvious. Although, of course, if they were brought up with

24:10.040 --> 24:19.600
that in mind, then you have another problem. Are you really giving the person
any choice? And what he becomes later on, if you deliberately clone someone,

24:20.300 --> 24:31.740
bring him up to do a certain thing, you know, I think there are moral issues
there too. Not that that would stop big-time sports people from trying to clone

24:31.740 --> 24:42.840
somebody, especially if they had enough money to throw around. Yeah, that seems
to be where all the money is these days. Yep. Okay, the novel The Sudden Star is

24:42.840 --> 24:51.120
another expansion of a couple of short stories. Again, the same question, did
you have the novel in mind when you came up with the short stories? No, the

24:51.120 --> 25:03.540
short story was just one short story. And then later on, I thought perhaps of
writing about some of the other characters in the book. But I had only written

25:03.540 --> 25:16.060
one story when I sat down and tried to figure out what kind of novel I would do.
And so that was more... In that book, which was my second novel, I came a little

25:16.060 --> 25:33.660
closer to actually planning a novel as a novel than I had in Clone Life. And...
Well, I don't really know what else to say about that. When I read Julio 204, I

25:33.660 --> 25:44.040
got the idea that Simon Negron was a pretty rough, tough, callous customer. But
when I read The Sudden Star, especially toward the end of the book, he turned

25:44.040 --> 25:55.540
out to be a little bit different than I would have anticipated. Did he grow as
you wrote the novel? Oh yes, I definitely think so. I definitely think so. And

25:55.540 --> 26:03.960
also, well, of course, one of the other things with that character is, like a
lot of characters that I write about, I sometimes use as a starting point people

26:03.960 --> 26:14.660
I know. Very often, that's how I'll start, although then the characters change.
And they are never exact duplicates of anyone I know by the time I finish a

26:14.660 --> 26:23.100
book, because obviously they're going to be changed. The action of the book is
going to change them and so forth. But I did start out with a particular person

26:23.100 --> 26:33.380
in mind whom I knew when I wrote about Simon Negron. And I suppose as I came to
know more about him, that was probably reflected in how he was portrayed in the

26:33.380 --> 26:33.980
book also.

26:38.820 --> 26:48.420
The principal scenes in that book took place in upstate New York and New York
City and Miami. Are you very familiar with the geography of all these places?

26:48.620 --> 26:59.520
Because there was quite a realistic feeling. Well, I went to every place in the
book. Every place that's in the book, I went to. Because I don't like to write

26:59.520 --> 27:06.760
about places I haven't been or things I haven't seen. Now, sometimes it's
unavoidable in science fiction, obviously, if you're going to write about the

27:06.760 --> 27:15.220
moon or if you're going to write about another planet. But at least with the
solar system, there's more and more research being done that you can read about.

27:15.320 --> 27:24.360
But as far as Earth goes, I like to visit places that I'm going to write about.
I feel much more comfortable doing that. And all of those places are places I've

27:24.360 --> 27:24.740
seen.

27:27.460 --> 27:37.460
I'm on the subway, unfortunately. The subway seemed to be breaking down in New
York a lot more quickly than I anticipated when I wrote The Sudden Star.

27:43.380 --> 27:52.240
Do you have the location in mind where the farm was, that area, which part of
upstate New York that's around? I've thought of Pennsylvania more than upstate

27:52.240 --> 28:04.800
New York. I think the farm was probably in Pennsylvania. I'm right near the
Pennsylvania border anyway. Okay. Okay. At what point in your writing did Mura

28:04.800 --> 28:21.540
star, that idea of that symbolism come into existence? Well, I thought of that
at the beginning, and originally I had thought of an actual cosmic disaster

28:21.540 --> 28:29.680
which had affected the Earth. And then I began to think that that really wasn't
what I was driving at in the book. I didn't want to talk about something that's

28:29.680 --> 28:39.540
completely outside but destroys things. Because what has destroyed the earth in
that book? it's not anything outside of it or anything in the cosmos. It's the

28:39.540 --> 28:47.140
people on earth itself who have destroyed it. And the Star is simply their
explanation because, you know, it's a way of evading the responsibility in a

28:47.140 --> 28:58.060
sense. Having seen everything fall apart, people, I assumed, would look for
something to blame. And in this particular case, they blame this star, which

28:58.060 --> 29:03.940
really has nothing to do with anything. It's just what's going to get the blame
for the situation.

29:06.940 --> 29:18.440
Excuse me. That's okay. Go ahead. That's the hard thing about talking on a
phone. You don't get any signals here. Is The Sudden Star your title? Yes, it

29:18.440 --> 29:28.120
is. Although in England, the publisher asked if they could change the title to
The White Death. because they didn't want it to sound like a science-fiction

29:28.120 --> 29:35.960
book. So they thought The White Death, I guess, sounded more like a non-science
-fiction book. I didn't think that was worth arguing about, so I said that's

29:35.960 --> 29:46.940
fine. And I suppose I could have called it The White Death, too, but I didn't. I
think The Seven Stars is much more appropriate. I think it probably is, too. I

29:46.940 --> 29:54.760
think it probably is, too. Although what's interesting about the British
publisher picking that particular title is that one of the periods I had done

29:54.760 --> 30:05.820
some research on before doing the Southern Star was the 13th century, and in the
14th century, I wanted to read about a period where everything was breaking

30:05.820 --> 30:20.720
down, where society was beginning to collapse, and particularly the effects that
the Black Death had on Europe. And the reason I was doing that is because I was

30:20.720 --> 30:27.540
dealing with another society later on that was breaking down in the Sudden Star,
and I wanted to have some sense of what that kind of thing was like historically

30:27.540 --> 30:37.000
before I wrote about the future. And so I suppose in that sense it's appropriate
that they wanted to call it the White Death as opposed to the Black Death, but

30:38.420 --> 30:51.740
but I think the Sudden Star is probably a more pertinent title. You had some
good characters at the end of the book, Paulette and Ildico. Are you planning to

30:51.740 --> 31:01.880
do a sequel? Will we see these characters again? I'm not planning to do any
sequel because if one comes up, that's another matter. I suppose that one thing

31:01.880 --> 31:11.100
about writing is that the characters have lives before you start writing the
book and then they have lives that go on after you finish the book. And I

31:11.100 --> 31:17.420
suppose it's always possible to write each book from some other character's
point of view. And it's always possible to write about what happens to some of

31:17.420 --> 31:26.920
the people after you've finished one book, too. But if that happens, it happens.
I haven't consciously thought of it. That would have to grow by itself, I think.

31:29.660 --> 31:41.280
Okay, your novel Watch Star. That seemed to be a lot different from your other
books to me in that it was a much more visual book. There was a lot of, oh, the

31:41.280 --> 31:52.960
cat juggling scene, the visions of the ancient city, the bones all blowing
around. And was this a new facet of your writing? Well, I'm not sure. I think

31:52.960 --> 32:02.980
what was happening there is I was dealing with a character who, well, among
other things, she was different from other characters I'd written about in that

32:02.980 --> 32:15.460
she was a member of an illiterate culture. She was a member of a culture that
had certain psychic powers. And I suppose that looking at things through her

32:15.460 --> 32:20.940
eyes, which I had to do as I was writing it, it was a natural thing to see
things more visually.

32:26.560 --> 32:38.900
The novel science fiction concept in that book was life on the comets, people
settling in the comets and living there. How did that occur to you? Well, that

32:38.900 --> 32:52.340
was an idea I got from Freeman Dyson, who made the suggestion a few years ago
that you could get a comet and you could settle it and there are enough

32:52.340 --> 33:02.500
materials on some of the large comets so that you could have life there. You
could perhaps grow big giant trees. He even talks about growing these big giant

33:02.500 --> 33:12.000
trees and having these very green world. I loved that idea for one reason
because the one thing I didn't want to do is I didn't want to have my character

33:12.000 --> 33:23.200
Gaia and make contact with this other civilization which is settled in the
comets and then go up there and wind up in one of these stainless steel

33:23.200 --> 33:30.480
features. I just get so sick of those, or plastic features. You know, they seem
to be one or the other. You have the stainless steel ones that are very art

33:30.480 --> 33:42.400
deco, and then you have the plastic ones where everybody has tiny micro
-miniaturized things and weird sorts of decor that looked like the inside of

33:42.400 --> 33:51.700
McDonald's or something. And I didn't want to write about that kind of future
society. I wanted to have something a little different. And in fact, what I

33:51.700 --> 34:04.260
wound up with was having a comet society, which is very much like living in a
garden or living in a jungle or living in a natural environment in a way, even

34:04.260 --> 34:12.640
though it's a very unnaturally created environment. It just appealed to me more
than writing about the other kind of future, I suppose, or the other kind of

34:12.640 --> 34:28.820
future, possible future world. With all the clone novels and the stories that
we've seen, nobody has ever expressed the fear of what you did when Dye was

34:28.820 --> 34:39.100
talking. Is it Raiho? That's how I pronounced his name. And the Tay, after he
had died, and she was saying that they would implant another memory in his body,

34:39.320 --> 34:48.100
and Daya was arguing that that wouldn't be Reho. It has his memories, but his
soul is gone. He's gone. And I'd never seen anybody write that, although that

34:48.100 --> 34:57.180
had occurred to me, that the essence or whatever of the person would be gone.
And I was glad to see that discussed for a change. Yes, I mean, you can call it

34:57.180 --> 35:08.860
a soul if you want, or you could call it simply the memories and the essence, I
suppose, or whatever is in the person. The fact of the matter is if you take any

35:08.860 --> 35:20.840
body, I think, and strip it completely of its memories, its experiences, and so
on, even if you plant something in there that takes place, that has all the

35:20.840 --> 35:28.680
memories, now everyone else will treat the person exactly the same way. There
won't be any difference probably as far as they're concerned. The person will be

35:28.680 --> 35:40.840
the same to them. But it's not the same person. I think that's probably obvious.
I don't know. I know that it's a lot more popular to assume that it would be the

35:40.840 --> 35:51.320
same person, but it wouldn't be the same person. I just don't think so. So Ryho
really is dead as far as I'm concerned. The character who went through that book

35:51.320 --> 36:00.540
by that time is actually gone, even though there will be another rival who will
go about his business, who will have all his memories, and so on. Now, some

36:00.540 --> 36:09.400
people who have written about matter transmitters have talked about this, too.
If you send somebody through a matter transmitter, which is another sort of

36:09.400 --> 36:20.820
problem also, and you have somebody at the other end who's just duplicated from
the pattern, is that really the person, or has the person died and another

36:20.820 --> 36:23.080
person been created to take his place?

36:30.500 --> 36:33.520
Yeah, Captain Kirk was gone in the first episode, I guess.

36:36.260 --> 36:47.360
Okay, the Golden Space that had shades of cloned lives in that it was about a
group of concerned a group of children that were different and perceived

36:47.360 --> 36:58.900
themselves as different. Did this kind of idea occur to you when you were doing
Coled Lives, or did the embryonic stages of it hit you then? No, actually what

36:58.900 --> 37:07.740
happened with that story is it's unusual in one sense, because usually I write
stories without regard to where I'm going to sell them until after I finish

37:07.740 --> 37:19.120
them. In this particular case, Jack Dan was doing an anthology. He was doing it
on the theme of immortality. He had asked several writers for stories for the

37:19.120 --> 37:31.500
book. He wanted long stories. And so I thought about the topic and I said, well,
immortality, I don't know if there's really anything to write about immortality.

37:31.580 --> 37:40.060
I really didn't think there was. It just didn't seem that interesting to me. And
after I thought about it for a while, I finally decided maybe I would try

37:40.060 --> 37:49.560
writing a long story about it. But I was more interested not even in the
immortality theme, but in the theme of what would you do if you were immortal,

37:49.560 --> 37:59.020
and that was already a given. And you were beginning to get tired of things, and
what kind of children might you raise, and so on and so forth. I didn't really

37:59.020 --> 38:07.780
think of it as an outgrowth of clone lives at all, although I suppose some of
the same concerns must have been there, and I must have been sort of chewing

38:07.780 --> 38:19.760
them over in my mind without really realizing it. And so I wrote the first part
of the Golden Space, The Renewal, as a short novel for this anthology. Sort of

38:19.760 --> 38:28.220
stimulated me to think about the subject a little bit. And I figured that would
be the end of that, too. I guess it was another situation like Carl Lund. I

38:28.220 --> 38:36.560
thought, well, that's that. I've written that short novel, and I probably won't
have anything more to say about this. But later on, I found other things I

38:36.560 --> 38:43.840
wanted to write. The Summer's Dust section, I originally didn't write as a part
of that book at all, either. That's another thing. Even though it became part of

38:43.840 --> 38:53.020
the book, I wrote that as a separate story. and I knew it was dealing with the
same world, but I just thought it was going to be a separate story and not part

38:53.020 --> 38:59.820
of the novel. But later on, I decided to incorporate it since I wanted to use
one of the characters later on.

39:03.180 --> 39:16.400
Okay, you just answered my next question. Okay, the heart of the novel is
immortality, and then with aging and growing old, that sort of thing thrown in,

39:16.520 --> 39:24.960
I would think that this is where your philosophical background would have really
been helpful as opposed to those that don't have that kind of background to

39:24.960 --> 39:37.960
think about these sorts of things. Well, I don't know. Well, in the case of
immortality, I'm not so sure because that has been such a popular thing for

39:37.960 --> 39:46.620
people to think about since probably forever. I mean, people have always been
thinking about that. There have always been stories about people who were

39:46.620 --> 39:58.560
immortal or thought for immortality or whatever. The thing is what to do when
you actually have that is another problem. Maybe there had something to do with

39:58.560 --> 39:58.700
it.

40:03.000 --> 40:15.200
In the latter stages of the book, the character Domingo is explaining to the
people that he's captured or is treating to its hospitality. He's talking about

40:15.200 --> 40:22.440
his village and he's talking about the people in his village, that they have
divided minds and that their minds talk in voices to each other. So immediately

40:22.440 --> 40:32.180
to my mind came this book by Julian Jaynes called The Origin of Conscious and
the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Oh yes. Oh yes, yes. I definitely

40:32.180 --> 40:42.900
incorporated that book. I had read that book a couple of years earlier and I I
drew on it for some of the inspiration, although I'm a little dubious about some

40:42.900 --> 40:55.300
things in that book, although it can still be useful for a novel, even though
I'm somewhat dubious about, not necessarily about theory itself, but about his

40:55.300 --> 41:08.180
notion that people as recently as 3,000 years ago might have been in that state.
That I consider more dubious, and I found his analysis

41:08.180 --> 41:18.320
of the Iliad somewhat unconvincing. I don't even know if he knows Greek. I found
it a very, very strange thing, and I don't know any classicists who would buy

41:18.320 --> 41:19.900
that part of the argument at all.

41:22.680 --> 41:32.180
But as an idea, it's very intriguing. It does have the virtue of explaining a
lot of things that would otherwise be unexplainable. And for the purpose of this

41:32.180 --> 41:37.680
book, I thought maybe I would do a little bit using it.

41:41.180 --> 41:49.140
I'm glad I mentioned that book because I've never had any feedback from anybody
else that read it, and I thought it was a neat theory. I don't believe it, but

41:49.140 --> 41:57.360
it sure sounds nice, and I was glad to see it in your book. I thought that might
have been where it came from or that helped it. I don't know if I have enough

41:57.360 --> 41:59.520
originality to think of it all by myself.

42:02.340 --> 42:11.940
Okay, now I have another sort of trivia question. Since I read, either for the
first time, or re-read all your works together in a pretty short period of time,

42:11.940 --> 42:24.940
one thing I couldn't help noticing, I started counting them, and about 29 people
in the books that you've published have red hair. and I was just going to make

42:24.940 --> 42:32.980
that comment and see if that was something conscious or something... I'm sure
that's not conscious except, well, I mean, I have had red-haired friends, of

42:32.980 --> 42:42.820
course and I have known many people with red hair whether or not, well, I
suppose I could always do an analysis and say how many people have red hair how

42:42.820 --> 42:51.120
many people have blonde hair how many people have black hair how many people are
Caucasian how many people are black and so forth If I did a whole list of these

42:51.120 --> 43:00.560
things, I don't know if they would reflect their proportions in the population
or not. And I don't know if it really matters. I don't know if I have more

43:00.560 --> 43:11.200
redheads in there than are in the population as a whole. Maybe I do. No, I just
had to ask that. I noticed it, and I didn't know if there was some secret signal

43:11.200 --> 43:12.820
there. I didn't know there were that many.

43:15.580 --> 43:26.840
Okay, I kind of want to switch tracks here. You are better known in some circles
as an editor and an anthologist. I think that's something that science fiction

43:26.840 --> 43:38.120
fans know very little about. So could you give us kind of a cradle-to-grave
description of how one goes about editing a book from the idea to getting the

43:38.120 --> 43:46.840
people to do it for you? Do you think we ought to change tapes? Ask her how long
this answer is going to be. Okay. Will this be a long answer or a short answer?

43:47.400 --> 43:55.660
Oh, well, maybe you better change... Let's change tapes, yeah. We've got about
five, three minutes worth of tape. Okay, hang on. Tape's being changed. Okay,

43:55.760 --> 43:56.300
tape's being...
