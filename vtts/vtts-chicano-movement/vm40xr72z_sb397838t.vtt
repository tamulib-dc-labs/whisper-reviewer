WEBVTT

00:01.010 --> 00:09.719
Okay, so I am here with my tia, Lupe Valdez, and it's July 22nd, 2019.

00:12.541 --> 00:16.365
So we were just talking about kind of my project and stuff.

00:16.645 --> 00:23.753
And so really for this interview, I have two simple questions.

00:25.594 --> 00:28.317
And the first one is...

00:29.073 --> 00:31.917
If you, well, actually, let me start off.

00:31.937 --> 00:34.340
If you could tell me your name and age.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.041
Oh, okay.

00:35.121 --> 00:37.264
I'm Lupe Trujillo Valdez.

00:38.285 --> 00:39.747
I'm 74 years old.

00:40.488 --> 00:40.888
Okay.

00:41.088 --> 00:42.410
And where were you born?

00:42.570 --> 00:46.455
I was born in Dinuba, California, in the San Joaquin Valley.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.100
So, but grew up in Cutler.

00:51.302 --> 00:51.782
Cutler.

00:53.324 --> 00:53.765
Great.

00:53.985 --> 00:55.587
There was no hospital I was born.

00:56.663 --> 00:58.706
At a clinic.

00:59.928 --> 01:01.550
Oh, I thought you were going to say in the house.

01:01.650 --> 01:03.413
No, no, no.

01:04.314 --> 01:07.639
I think I'm the only one that was born actually not at home.

01:09.282 --> 01:10.744
And Sarah, I think we both were.

01:12.547 --> 01:25.506
I was just thinking about my grandma and she was telling us about when Grandma Victoriana would have babies, right?

01:25.586 --> 01:26.147
And that

01:26.279 --> 01:34.927
her grandma Kaya would like take her out of the house or something so that she wouldn't get scared of having kids.

01:34.947 --> 01:45.036
Well, you know, your grandma was, well, she was old enough to be my mother, you know, that the age gap between the oldest and the youngest.

01:45.156 --> 01:56.286
But I think she was embarrassed, especially when she, the last two, especially with me coming because the fact that, you know, she was a teenager, your grandma,

01:56.705 --> 02:04.277
And your great-grandma was still having kids.

02:04.398 --> 02:09.065
So it was a little jarring for her, I think, you know.

02:09.085 --> 02:12.751
It's not that common anymore because people don't have large families anymore.

02:12.811 --> 02:21.585
So the gap there, like with nine children, of course, then you're going to see the age difference.

02:22.046 --> 02:22.367
Yeah.

02:22.487 --> 02:22.727
Yeah.

02:22.868 --> 02:23.168
Yeah.

02:23.840 --> 02:29.226
So, okay, and you spent most or all of your life in California, right?

02:29.666 --> 02:30.647
Correct.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.489
All right.

02:33.070 --> 02:48.986
So the first kind of like main question that I have is, do you see yourself as a participant of the Chicano movement that happened in the 60s and 70s?

02:49.226 --> 02:50.928
Oh, of course, most definitely, yes.

02:51.469 --> 02:52.750
I am a product of that.

02:53.354 --> 02:59.066
And how would you, so how would you describe, like, how was, what was your participation like?

02:59.146 --> 03:00.969
How did you get into it?

03:01.531 --> 03:08.224
Well, you know, it's interesting because, you know, growing up in the San Joaquin Valley, especially in the 1950s,

03:09.065 --> 03:34.212
40s or 50s uh you know you you wanted to assimilate as much as possible only only because you didn't know your history the history our history or latino history or chicano history and it wasn't called chicano at the time um it wasn't um there was nothing we could identify with so growing up i remember

03:34.529 --> 03:41.417
dyeing my hair blonde because, and I didn't like my name, Lupe, it's too Mexican, you know?

03:41.437 --> 04:01.178
So it was really a feeling of not self-hatred because I don't think I really, but not knowing your identity and where you come from, other than you know that your parents are farm workers and they were struggling, you know, to raise nine children.

04:01.445 --> 04:16.045
but I always admired my father who was able to, and my mom especially, to be able to raise nine children as farm workers and be able to own their own home and, you know, have food on the table and a roof over our head.

04:16.266 --> 04:29.184
And so being the youngest, I think it was the beneficiary of not having to quit school in order for my younger siblings, which I did not have, to help out with the family.

04:29.284 --> 04:30.726
I think all my sisters and

04:31.617 --> 04:39.154
um, weren't actually forced, but suggested they, they help the family and start working.

04:39.174 --> 04:45.047
So I was, you know, I'm very fortunate to, there was the youngest of the nine children to do that.

04:45.067 --> 04:51.060
Um, so I'm grateful to that, but, uh, growing up, um, we didn't,

04:51.547 --> 04:54.490
We didn't really, never went out to dinner.

04:54.510 --> 04:56.533
I mean, that's like unheard of.

04:57.834 --> 05:07.205
So our social life was really just the compadres, my parents' compadres coming over, having dinner at our house, or we would go over there.

05:08.947 --> 05:19.039
So it wasn't until I went to Fresno State, actually the very first time that...

05:19.357 --> 05:28.017
I even became aware that there was not even a political movement, but something that I could identify with.

05:28.398 --> 05:38.040
It was during the March to Sacramento, Jessica Buccino performed in our hometown of Cutler.

05:38.324 --> 05:56.741
I remember coming home, I was going to College of the Sequoies at the time, and I remember coming home, and my mother was telling me about what had happened that afternoon when the farm workers came, or the crew that went ahead to set up for the nightly meetings was there in Cutler Park.

05:57.862 --> 06:03.387
And my mother happened to be there with her grandmothers, and I don't know why, because she never really went out that much.

06:04.088 --> 06:05.209
But she...

06:05.965 --> 06:20.240
She was there when they were setting up and there were two growers, well, one grower who was Mexicano, one, no, why don't I say Mexican-American because he didn't speak any English or Spanish.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.524
But he wanted to intimidate Luis.

06:24.665 --> 06:26.266
I didn't know it was Luis at the time.

06:26.286 --> 06:33.694
She described this, my mom described this person who, I guess the grower,

06:34.282 --> 06:41.256
thought that Luis was illiterate because he told him, what are you doing here?

06:41.356 --> 06:48.530
And, you know, and thought that he couldn't respond to him because he wouldn't be able to speak English.

06:48.690 --> 06:51.155
And of course, Luis is so eloquent.

06:51.215 --> 06:54.822
And my mother described it...

06:55.342 --> 07:05.503
And she didn't understand what he was saying, but just in his tone and the manner in which he spoke.

07:05.821 --> 07:15.310
all of a sudden she said, he spoke with such beautiful words and she didn't know what it was, but she stood up to, he stood up to, to the grower.

07:15.330 --> 07:18.413
And so that night we went to the, to see the performance.

07:18.754 --> 07:22.737
And that was the first time I'd ever seen live theater.

07:23.018 --> 07:27.102
I had never in my life, even in high school, we never went to plays.

07:29.464 --> 07:34.028
Never went, we went to the Mexican movies.

07:34.269 --> 07:35.710
That's our former military.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.198
entertainment growing up.

07:37.779 --> 07:46.348
But that night when I saw it, I just, it immediately was like, oh, they're speaking to me.

07:47.469 --> 07:50.632
I could identify exactly what they were saying.

07:50.772 --> 07:56.398
I mean, and they were acting on stage and singing and it was such an incredible experience.

07:56.418 --> 07:58.741
And we had some farm workers stay with us that evening.

07:59.822 --> 08:04.026
And so,

08:04.360 --> 08:16.230
So the next morning, they all took off, went to Sanger, I believe the next stop was, and a group of us went to see them perform, the Teatro Capricino performed the next night.

08:16.250 --> 08:33.625
And it was just this feeling that I finally felt I belonged somewhere, that I could identify with everyone and everything, and that it had something to say, and they were fighting for farm worker rights.

08:34.060 --> 08:48.754
My, I don't know if you know this, but your grandpa, your great grandpa Lorenzo and my mother, your grandma, your great grandma, uh, were in the, um, probably your grandma probably talked to you about it.

08:49.374 --> 09:00.625
Uh, uh, when they were in Ventura in Fillmore, they were in the lemon strike and they were in a labor camp and it was during the war.

09:01.347 --> 09:08.475
And my mom and dad or my dad went on strike and all the people that were living there in that camp went on strike.

09:09.095 --> 09:13.820
Well, the government came in because they said the war, they needed the produce.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.563
And so they broke the strike.

09:16.583 --> 09:22.890
And so they told all the farm workers that had been living there that they could go back.

09:23.511 --> 09:25.213
And my mother's refused.

09:25.993 --> 09:28.076
She says, I'm not, I'm not going back there.

09:28.576 --> 09:31.219
And that's why we moved from Fillmore.

09:31.773 --> 09:33.676
to Cutler.

09:34.297 --> 09:34.798
Oh, wow.

09:34.818 --> 09:37.562
Because she didn't want to stay there anymore.

09:38.784 --> 09:53.648
And your Tia Lala and Grandma, and they all lived together in the camp, and Tia Lala went to Dinuba, and that's where my mother decided, okay, we're closer to her sister.

09:54.329 --> 09:54.810
So...

09:55.297 --> 10:06.173
So there was this sense with your grandpa Lorenzo and your grandma Trujillo, some political activism before that.

10:06.854 --> 10:12.321
So with farm workers coming and striking, they were sympathetic to that.

10:12.482 --> 10:20.393
And so invited some of the farm workers to come and stay with us that night in Cutler, even though we didn't have that much room.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.312
Nonetheless, they stayed with us.

10:23.332 --> 10:37.352
So I went the next day to see them and sang the group, and then it wasn't until about six months later that we heard that the theater was reforming an Alfonso church in Fresno.

10:38.473 --> 10:46.444
And so a group of us, and at that time I had already transferred from COS, College of Sequoia, to Fresno State.

10:47.206 --> 10:48.928
And so I was there taking...

10:49.482 --> 11:03.374
We went to see them and that's when I met Luis officially for the first time because we hadn't talked before and he said he was teaching a class at Fresno State.

11:04.515 --> 11:08.899
So he told us we were a group of young Chicanas that were there.

11:09.419 --> 11:19.168
We didn't call ourselves Chicanas then because we were just bonding together and so we went to

11:19.722 --> 11:21.895
We went to St.

11:21.935 --> 11:24.248
Alphonsus to see them perform when we saw

11:24.903 --> 11:29.669
Bernabé for the first time, and they did the short actos.

11:30.671 --> 11:38.701
And then he told us that he was going to be teaching a class at Fresno State under the experimental college.

11:38.741 --> 11:42.706
It wasn't even Chicano studies, there was no Chicano department, there was nothing.

11:43.147 --> 11:46.031
It was called La Raza studies, and it was just a class.

11:46.992 --> 11:54.522
And so a group of us took the class, and we had to drive to Del Rey

11:54.957 --> 11:57.621
in order to take the class.

11:57.802 --> 12:04.693
He did teach one, you know, just most of the classes were done in Del Rey.

12:05.134 --> 12:09.581
And so I used to drive down there and start, I have to blow my nose, excuse me.

12:09.741 --> 12:09.961
Yeah.

12:13.047 --> 12:15.170
Is this taking too long of a description?

12:15.190 --> 12:16.352
No, it's good.

12:16.412 --> 12:17.033
It's great.

12:18.616 --> 12:41.277
I was going to say that that story you were telling about Grandma and Grandpa Trujillo, that my mom had mentioned something about that, that when the grape strike happened, that she was like, I just remember there being a lot of like kind of division in the family because my grandparents were supportive of them.

12:41.697 --> 12:45.561
And then you had, you know, some of my tios who were contractors.

12:45.901 --> 12:46.041
Mm hmm.

12:46.223 --> 13:15.117
and uh and she's like and then my aunts would come in and it was just she's like i didn't know what was going on i was yeah it was very uh it was very divided between our family because we had two um contractors uh i think your grandpa was a contractor too wasn't he yeah actually i don't remember anyway tío lupe was and uh but um anyway he um

13:16.244 --> 13:20.950
So, you know, it was a political.

13:21.911 --> 13:29.240
When Lisa and I got married, this is jumping forward, you know, my family came to the wedding, of course.

13:29.620 --> 13:37.650
It wasn't a Catholic wedding, and so some of my family members left after the ceremony.

13:38.391 --> 13:44.859
My mom and dad stayed, Fidel stayed, but the majority of my family members left.

13:45.199 --> 13:45.660
Yeah, yeah.

13:45.809 --> 13:58.573
Well, I mean, so kind of the reason I was bringing up my mom's story about that is because she didn't explain why they were supportive, you know, why your parents were supportive of the farm workers.

13:58.653 --> 13:59.074
Yeah.

13:59.094 --> 14:06.328
So I'm glad that you kind of cleared that up, that they had been involved in something in Ventura.

14:06.348 --> 14:06.568
Yeah.

14:06.650 --> 14:08.794
I appreciate that.

14:09.295 --> 14:24.927
Can I also ask you about, so this time that Teatro Campesino is coming to Cutler, where you first see them, so you're talking about this is them marching with the UFW from Delano to Sacramento?

14:25.007 --> 14:25.929
Right, 1965.

14:25.989 --> 14:28.033
1965, okay.

14:28.385 --> 14:31.229
And then you said you were already in school?

14:31.369 --> 14:31.890
Yes.

14:31.910 --> 14:32.752
Or at Fresno State?

14:32.912 --> 14:39.702
I graduated in 1963 from Rossi Union High School, and then I had gone to College of Sequoias.

14:39.722 --> 14:41.945
So I was a student there.

14:42.226 --> 14:46.592
I think it was... Where is that at, College of Sequoias?

14:46.612 --> 14:47.293
In Visalia.

14:47.313 --> 14:47.814
Oh, okay.

14:47.834 --> 14:48.395
Yeah.

14:48.415 --> 14:50.218
So that's the junior college there.

14:50.819 --> 14:55.906
So I went there two years, worked my way through as a bookkeeper.

14:56.447 --> 14:57.008
Mm-hmm.

14:57.747 --> 15:02.151
And how did you end up even at that college?

15:03.593 --> 15:08.157
Well, because Celia had gone there.

15:08.177 --> 15:20.169
And, you know, I never took college prep courses in high school because I never really thought of myself going on to a four-year college.

15:20.230 --> 15:22.692
It wasn't something...

15:24.562 --> 15:26.726
that anybody expected of you?

15:26.746 --> 15:28.028
None of my family members.

15:28.709 --> 15:40.849
Celia was the honor student, and she took classes, and so she went on to COS, and I thought, well, I'll try it.

15:41.268 --> 15:44.411
It was really because of her that I went to school.

15:44.572 --> 15:50.718
I took classes, not transferable classes, because I figured I was only going to go there two years.

15:50.799 --> 15:53.341
I was going to go to business.

15:54.062 --> 16:03.012
That's why I worked as a bookkeeper in a hardware store in Visalia.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.516
And then I thought,

16:07.205 --> 16:08.226
I can do this.

16:08.607 --> 16:09.889
It's not impossible.

16:09.909 --> 16:12.292
And so I thought, you know what?

16:12.312 --> 16:15.757
Maybe I should transfer to Fresno State.

16:15.797 --> 16:17.399
And Celia was going to go to Fresno.

16:17.419 --> 16:19.662
She was already at Fresno State.

16:19.742 --> 16:23.287
And so we ended up going together.

16:23.307 --> 16:29.435
And I think that helped too, is having the support or... Or like some kind of role model.

16:29.515 --> 16:29.755
Yes.

16:31.157 --> 16:31.558
Yeah.

16:31.578 --> 16:33.300
And this was 1965, you said?

16:34.261 --> 16:35.263
No, this was in 1967.

16:35.283 --> 16:36.925
Oh, okay.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.440
That you went to Fresno State?

16:39.861 --> 16:40.882
Yes.

16:40.902 --> 16:41.002
Okay.

16:41.022 --> 16:43.787
Well, I actually graduated in 67 from Fresno State.

16:44.067 --> 16:45.049
Okay.

16:45.069 --> 16:46.792
So you were there before?

16:47.032 --> 16:49.396
Yeah.

16:50.678 --> 16:52.260
Interesting.

16:52.921 --> 16:54.865
And Celia graduated in 68.

16:55.105 --> 16:59.752
So, no, wait a minute.

17:01.435 --> 17:03.318
She graduated in 67.

17:03.378 --> 17:04.420
I graduated in 68.

17:04.941 --> 17:05.241
Oh, okay.

17:07.364 --> 17:10.166
And she's a little older.

17:11.388 --> 17:23.098
So you were kind of talking about your introduction into the Chicano movement and that you had gone to Fresno State and took this class with Louise.

17:23.458 --> 17:32.206
Well, actually, the classes that I was taking, I was introduced to Cary McBrillian's book, a book.

17:35.468 --> 17:37.270
Oh, God, it's in my mind here.

17:37.688 --> 17:39.510
Did you say Carrie McWilliams?

17:39.550 --> 17:39.790
Yes.

17:43.995 --> 17:45.076
Let me book it up.

17:46.538 --> 17:47.439
Oh, my God.

17:47.479 --> 17:49.661
That was the one that was pivotal.

17:50.743 --> 17:54.927
When I read that book, it changed my life completely.

17:54.947 --> 17:55.788
North from Mexico.

17:57.230 --> 18:04.438
And it was the first time that anybody had ever written anything about the history of the

18:05.127 --> 18:07.851
of Mexicanos in the United States.

18:08.872 --> 18:16.423
And I think the teatro came up with the coin.

18:18.526 --> 18:25.075
Well, that's where I learned from the Teatro Campesino was Chicano, the word Chicano.

18:25.676 --> 18:31.223
And I'm not sure whether in Northern Mexico I never mentioned Chicano because it wasn't a book that was written.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.767
It was written, I think, in the 1940s.

18:34.051 --> 18:44.649
But it talked about the Blasero program and talked about, you know, the inequities here in the United States of how Mexicanos were being treated and how we've been treated in the past.

18:44.709 --> 18:52.822
And so it just gave a whole, you know, history on us here in the United States.

18:53.203 --> 18:53.764
And...

18:54.436 --> 18:57.340
So that, of course, made me more political.

18:57.801 --> 19:00.045
And of course it was during the Vietnam War.

19:00.185 --> 19:02.068
And so we got all active about that.

19:02.328 --> 19:11.382
And I started performing with the Giante Campesino in 1968 and toured with the company.

19:11.716 --> 19:18.306
So what was your, um, in those kind of early days, like what was your role in the teatro?

19:18.346 --> 19:19.468
Were you acting?

19:19.568 --> 19:23.093
Were you helping out in the background?

19:23.153 --> 19:24.235
Organizing?

19:24.856 --> 19:31.146
Um, I think everybody that's ever worked at the jazz has acted in, in, in some form of capacity.

19:31.506 --> 19:36.994
Uh, you know, uh, Lisa and I will be celebrating 50 years this year of marriage.

19:37.175 --> 19:39.598
So it's been a long road here.

19:40.380 --> 19:40.660
Um,

19:41.028 --> 19:48.579
But, you know, when I started, you know, we got married in 69.

19:51.142 --> 19:57.892
But I had been performing, acting with a company from the very beginning.

19:57.952 --> 20:01.097
That was the key role I did.

20:01.217 --> 20:08.487
I was one of the original Miss Jimenez in Los Vendidos and

20:08.939 --> 20:18.122
So we toured all over the state with that.

20:19.827 --> 20:26.323
So that was my first introduction to the company as a performer.

20:26.540 --> 20:28.102
We didn't call ourselves actors.

20:29.303 --> 20:31.505
It was not a profession.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.387
It was more of a political.

20:33.407 --> 20:37.831
Oh, he said I fell in love with Lisa's politics first before I fell in love with him.

20:39.973 --> 20:46.559
It was just that he was one of the prime movers of the Chicano movement at the time.

20:47.560 --> 20:55.348
And so how do you see that participation, being part of the teatro,

20:55.666 --> 21:05.078
How do you see that as being, like you just said that you saw Luis as a prime mover of the Chicano movement.

21:05.738 --> 21:14.169
Like what was it about that group being a part of that group that tied in with the movement in general?

21:15.230 --> 21:24.762
Well, you know, because after I graduated from college, I mean, I worked as a teacher in the west side of Fresno.

21:25.467 --> 21:32.578
And although it was, for me, that was my intention.

21:32.618 --> 21:37.045
I had told Louise, I'll probably get married and live a middle-class life.

21:37.065 --> 21:42.113
That was, I thought that was what I was geared to do.

21:42.133 --> 21:50.125
I mean, coming from the background that I came from, that was the only opportunity

21:50.442 --> 21:53.930
not the only option, but I thought that was my only option at the time.

21:54.110 --> 21:57.077
And then he said something like, well, we'll have to do something about it.

21:57.097 --> 21:57.979
We'll have to get married.

21:57.999 --> 21:59.121
And that was his proposal.

22:01.206 --> 22:08.923
But I think for me, I've always, you know, it, it was a,

22:09.528 --> 22:13.852
A life that I wanted politically, and it still is.

22:14.213 --> 22:19.699
That hasn't changed, especially now with the politics of the country, the way it's going.

22:19.819 --> 22:22.542
And you understand.

22:22.562 --> 22:26.646
I mean, going back, it was almost not the same.

22:27.166 --> 22:30.029
It was you felt the need to do something.

22:30.109 --> 22:35.535
You felt the need to speak out, to protest, to...

22:35.971 --> 22:47.081
politicized to, not politicized, that was a term used then, but I mean, to inform people about what was happening, not to be complacent.

22:47.541 --> 22:58.992
And so I always thought that that was my key role in that is to be able to contribute to that.

22:59.012 --> 23:00.873
And when you're young, you're able to do that.

23:00.913 --> 23:05.978
You're able to, you have the time and the energy

23:06.312 --> 23:10.077
to be able to do that.

23:10.297 --> 23:24.155
And you're, I don't want to say naive, but you're ready to do anything that it takes in order to improve conditions for those around you.

23:26.378 --> 23:27.900
It does for now.

23:28.922 --> 23:30.203
Hopefully that still works.

23:30.624 --> 23:31.044
Okay.

23:31.145 --> 23:32.727
I think it's going to.

23:33.107 --> 23:33.367
Yeah.

23:33.688 --> 23:33.788
Yeah.

23:34.763 --> 23:39.390
So, yeah, it was a different time.

23:39.931 --> 23:49.726
I sometimes get a little disheartened by what's happening now and feeling the need to do something.

23:51.709 --> 24:00.362
And at this point in my life, I'm 74, so it's not like I can just get up on a bus and go to the border and protest.

24:02.765 --> 24:03.927
And I'm not sure that

24:04.514 --> 24:07.157
I don't know what the solutions are now.

24:08.838 --> 24:13.823
So the only thing is I know from experience that this too will pass.

24:14.984 --> 24:18.708
So it's not the end of the world.

24:21.110 --> 24:33.222
But we have to be vigilant and we have to be aware of what is happening around us.

24:34.012 --> 24:36.536
And you know, you get to a point where you get more spiritual too.

24:37.498 --> 24:46.172
I know that having lived this long now, that I can't function without my belief in a power greater than myself.

24:46.974 --> 24:49.658
And so I've had to deal with

24:49.958 --> 25:18.227
lot of issues not just on the political basis of being Chicano but just being as a human being and we struggle when we live and we have challenges in the world that in our life that we have to see and I'm thankful you know that I have my health right now there are things that I'm thankful for that my family is as well that I

25:19.507 --> 25:29.505
I don't have to have that wall of anger and anxiety about what's happening around me, but at the same time, I will support anyone or anything, you know?

25:29.525 --> 25:29.785
Yeah.

25:30.887 --> 25:39.422
Um, and so I guess maybe, um, like, how did you see

25:40.111 --> 25:45.817
How did you see your participation with Teatro as doing that or like doing something?

25:45.977 --> 25:48.439
What was it that you guys were doing?

25:48.479 --> 25:48.980
You know what I mean?

25:49.080 --> 25:50.021
Yeah.

25:50.041 --> 25:55.846
Well, you know, Teatro was so young when I first joined the company.

25:55.866 --> 25:59.790
I mean, it was like four years old, you know.

26:00.791 --> 26:05.816
So at the very beginning, there was the excitement of all that, you know, when you're in your 20s.

26:05.836 --> 26:06.777
Yeah.

26:07.448 --> 26:10.412
that propelled you to do all kinds of different things.

26:10.532 --> 26:13.976
And it was an era that was different than now.

26:14.057 --> 26:20.965
You don't see political groups performing in colleges and universities as we did.

26:21.566 --> 26:23.769
We have a theater now.

26:25.171 --> 26:32.681
And, you know, I see a lot of young groups that are still doing it, and I love it that they have the energy to do that.

26:32.701 --> 26:36.966
I truly believe that we did...

26:38.633 --> 26:41.236
We were able to touch people's lives when we did.

26:42.958 --> 26:55.534
I know now everything now is turning from Chicano to Latino X. It's kind of like, I think every generation has to create titles for themselves.

26:56.095 --> 27:00.220
I don't know if Chicano will last.

27:00.470 --> 27:03.955
I know that it fit us at the time.

27:04.055 --> 27:06.318
I'm not insisting that we be called Chicanos.

27:06.379 --> 27:12.568
If you want to be called Latino X or the one that got me the other day was Chicanx.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.572
I can't even say it.

27:15.692 --> 27:20.018
But you know that everyone, every generation is entitled to identify who they are.

27:20.960 --> 27:27.489
And if that motivates them, and my table is the cat sits on it.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.173
I try to clean it, but it's like...

27:30.828 --> 27:33.151
I thought it was salt or something.

27:33.231 --> 27:34.173
No, no, no, no.

27:34.413 --> 27:39.200
It's, it's, it's, I don't know what it's, uh, yeah.

27:39.220 --> 27:40.461
She's so old.

27:40.481 --> 27:41.523
She's like 14 years.

27:41.603 --> 27:42.925
We got her.

27:42.965 --> 27:43.886
She's outside.

27:44.587 --> 27:49.714
She's, uh, and she's losing all her teeth and she has some babas and...

27:49.694 --> 27:52.538
Oh, my God, this poor little cat, you know.

27:53.580 --> 27:59.348
I'll tell you a story about the cat because she was a stray cat.

27:59.368 --> 28:04.415
There was a family down the street that had like, oh, and she had about 20 cats.

28:04.456 --> 28:08.642
And when she passed away, they all scattered, you know, throughout the neighborhood.

28:09.303 --> 28:15.111
And Tomasa was outside here, and Monica came.

28:15.513 --> 28:21.903
And she didn't tell me, but she went to the store and got cat food and started feeding her.

28:21.923 --> 28:26.530
So we said that, and then I bought a litter box just in case.

28:27.752 --> 28:30.777
And now she sleeps in the bed.

28:31.778 --> 28:34.282
No, she doesn't.

28:34.843 --> 28:37.487
We said that if Obama won the first time,

28:38.193 --> 28:39.254
Then she could come in.

28:39.274 --> 28:45.202
So as soon as the election was, you know, he won, we opened the door, and she's never left.

28:45.222 --> 28:46.964
But that was 15 years ago.

28:47.504 --> 28:52.390
So she's at least that old, and I think, you know, she could be older.

28:52.791 --> 28:53.091
Yeah.

28:53.111 --> 28:56.776
Yeah, so anyway.

28:56.876 --> 29:01.341
Oh, no, she's 10 years old, yeah.

29:01.361 --> 29:04.926
My cat mama passed away two years ago.

29:05.186 --> 29:07.609
She was 19 and a half, almost 20 years.

29:08.382 --> 29:27.268
20 years old yeah little baby yeah anyway um okay so it's interesting because we're just talking about um like what role did the teatro play in the chicano movement right

29:27.957 --> 29:34.885
And, uh, and I think you had kind of said that it was bringing a message or something like that, right?

29:34.985 --> 29:36.167
Oh, most definitely.

29:36.187 --> 29:37.108
Yes.

29:37.128 --> 29:45.658
Uh, all the, the short one act plays, well, you, we call them authors, uh, you know, and you're familiar with them.

29:45.678 --> 29:49.623
Um, uh, I think it brought a message.

29:49.643 --> 29:55.990
It is, but you know, I think that for us, it was always a question of the professionality of it, uh,

29:56.847 --> 30:14.312
I think our productions were, I mean, I'm sure your mom has said, you know, like Luis was a, I mean, you know, from the very beginning, it was rehearsal, rehearsal, rehearsal.

30:14.492 --> 30:16.335
I mean, it wasn't just putting it up there.

30:16.375 --> 30:22.223
We had to do it in precision because most of us were not professional actors.

30:22.243 --> 30:26.449
And so it really depended more on the body movement.

30:26.632 --> 30:29.786
than anything else because otherwise you couldn't.

30:29.967 --> 30:34.667
Our signature piece is La Carfa de los Sasquatches, which is

30:34.799 --> 30:37.082
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

30:37.322 --> 30:38.183
Have you ever seen it?

30:38.263 --> 30:42.328
I'm sure you've seen it because your dad was in, played the Pelado.

30:42.908 --> 30:53.320
But I don't know if you know this, but this was a song that my father, your great-grandpa, used to sing to us.

30:53.981 --> 30:58.906
El Corrido de... Well, it wasn't Corrido de Jesús Pelado.

30:58.926 --> 31:03.912
It was El Corrido de... What was...

31:04.246 --> 31:06.990
I have the recording of my dad singing it.

31:07.010 --> 31:33.949
Luis recorded him singing it and based on that recording we developed La Carpa de los Sasquatches and that's really our signature piece because it really is theatrically it's I think one of our best pieces we've ever done as an acto because it's so stylized and

31:34.435 --> 31:41.102
And the direction of it is, I mean, it's still used today and could be used today.

31:41.882 --> 31:43.524
We revived it a couple of years ago.

31:44.045 --> 31:48.970
But that is based on your grandpa's singing that song.

31:49.991 --> 32:02.383
And so it's a song about somebody like... No, it's somebody coming around,

32:03.190 --> 32:24.355
Anyway, the song, it talks about this migrant who's leaving his home in Mexico and by himself crossing the border and

32:24.706 --> 32:30.635
and they tell him that he can't cross because he doesn't have any money.

32:30.675 --> 32:31.696
His money is no good.

32:31.776 --> 32:47.239
It's from Mexico, but then if you give him a mojada, he'll let you pass, and so he comes to the United States, and he always wants to go, and he sends money back to Mexico to his mother, and then his mother, of course, dies.

32:47.559 --> 32:54.409
This is all part of the lyrics in the song, and my dad used to sing it really slow, and

32:54.912 --> 33:00.501
But then when we started doing the production, the beat was much faster.

33:01.142 --> 33:07.131
But it does tell about the immigration of what happens at the border.

33:07.592 --> 33:10.477
And literally, they used to wash them down like cattle.

33:10.937 --> 33:11.999
They used to cross the border.

33:12.460 --> 33:15.985
So that piece in itself, we toured all over the country.

33:16.025 --> 33:17.728
We toured it in Europe.

33:18.008 --> 33:19.671
And so it became one of our...

33:20.056 --> 33:24.040
are pieces that is still done today.

33:24.060 --> 33:29.966
So... So you basically took a song... A ballad.

33:30.347 --> 33:34.031
A ballad and then kind of put it to... Recreate it.

33:34.231 --> 33:35.072
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:35.092 --> 33:36.053
Oh, that's so interesting.

33:36.233 --> 33:36.794
Yeah, yeah.

33:36.814 --> 33:38.055
So, and it came from my dad.

33:38.275 --> 33:41.739
So that's, you know, so that's the other thread from it.

33:42.079 --> 33:42.640
Yeah.

33:42.660 --> 33:48.426
I think I sent it to your... I think I sent you a copy to...

33:48.845 --> 33:49.886
Of him singing it?

33:49.926 --> 33:51.007
Yeah.

33:51.187 --> 33:52.108
I can send it to you.

33:53.430 --> 33:56.633
I feel like I've heard it, and I don't know from whom.

33:56.753 --> 33:58.295
Maybe Teresa or something.

33:58.375 --> 34:01.558
I think I sent it to Teresa or somebody in your family.

34:01.578 --> 34:01.959
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:01.979 --> 34:04.661
Because your grandma wasn't going to be able to.

34:04.862 --> 34:05.242
Yeah.

34:14.111 --> 34:14.652
Oh, my God.

34:14.672 --> 34:16.774
Hi, mijo.

34:16.814 --> 34:16.894
Hey.

34:17.195 --> 34:17.896
I'm good.

34:17.916 --> 34:19.078
I'm here with Rocio.

34:19.298 --> 34:20.459
We're doing an interview.

34:22.903 --> 34:23.924
Oh, okay.

34:24.205 --> 34:25.026
I'll talk to you later.

34:26.408 --> 34:26.708
Okay.

34:26.808 --> 34:27.149
Bye-bye.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.133
He's an ally.

34:30.153 --> 34:34.659
He's doing a stage reading.

34:34.799 --> 34:36.141
I think it's this Thursday.

34:36.602 --> 34:40.587
So.

34:41.528 --> 34:42.951
Yeah, so that's interesting.

34:44.574 --> 34:50.927
I just kind of want to go back to that point about the message, right?

34:51.408 --> 34:56.298
And it reminds me, because I interviewed my dad too.

34:57.541 --> 34:59.805
So, so far I've interviewed my mom and my dad, right?

35:00.647 --> 35:03.132
And my dad...

35:03.736 --> 35:14.206
The way that he described what Teatro Campesino was doing in those early days was the same thing.

35:14.346 --> 35:20.352
Like, you know, hey, we're organizing, we're agitating, we're getting a message out, right?

35:20.432 --> 35:23.375
And we're taking it to different communities.

35:24.516 --> 35:30.001
And my mom had the same kind of response too.

35:30.822 --> 35:32.123
That we were doing something.

35:32.339 --> 35:37.225
Well, you know, uh, I think we all felt the need to do something.

35:38.086 --> 35:58.132
And, um, and I think because, uh, especially not having had, not knowing, but our history, it was important, I think for all of us, I think to identify with something, um, and to be able to do something about it and to spread that message.

35:58.993 --> 35:59.173
Um,

36:00.132 --> 36:02.795
But you know, the pendulum always swings.

36:02.815 --> 36:04.837
It's always, it never stays thin.

36:05.297 --> 36:19.472
It just, you know, different eras in, something happens, and you hope that the earth that you, the seeds that you planted keep growing, that they don't die.

36:19.612 --> 36:21.934
So you keep having to water them.

36:22.875 --> 36:29.262
And of course weeds are always growing, so you have to always weed your garden.

36:30.271 --> 36:41.065
So I think for us, I think it's a new generation that needs to come up to the forefront.

36:42.066 --> 36:51.338
But I think what we did then was, you know, they always say, look at your past, but don't stare at it.

36:51.358 --> 36:55.844
I don't go back to that time and say, God, I wish I was back then.

36:56.825 --> 36:57.426
It is what it,

36:57.642 --> 37:03.227
it was, it is what it is, it was, and, um, it's part of history.

37:03.247 --> 37:08.512
And you hope that, you know, uh, people evolve to another level.

37:09.313 --> 37:26.129
Uh, I'm getting to the point in my life, you know, um, you know, I'm facing the third act of my life now, you know, so I look at the past as something like back there that is, um, is a, yes, it's a part of me, but it's not me anymore.

37:27.170 --> 37:27.430
Um,

37:28.456 --> 37:36.584
I, you know, I've been very fortunate, I've been very blessed, and I'm very thankful I'm getting to that point in my life.

37:37.745 --> 37:42.770
I, you know, you asked me what I was doing then.

37:43.190 --> 37:49.116
I started as a performer, you know, and then because I was raising my kids, that was my primary focus.

37:49.176 --> 37:51.097
I really did that.

37:51.218 --> 37:58.024
It was communal in that sense, so I never felt not engaged at all, but my

37:58.291 --> 38:27.994
primary focus was raising my my three boys uh and when they became you know were able to walk and do all things they were part of it uh they performed with us they traveled all over with us um and i was a bookkeeper for the organization this third which is really surprising this third act in my life is as i've become a costume designer and it's it's an interesting because it wasn't something that i had

38:28.278 --> 38:29.960
This is my intention.

38:30.040 --> 38:34.726
It's what I was going to, my dream that I was one day going to be this.

38:35.647 --> 38:43.777
And to be able to design for the Marte Aperforum was unexpected.

38:44.417 --> 38:51.686
It wasn't anything that I had, you know.

38:51.706 --> 38:53.408
It's something that I love doing.

38:53.607 --> 38:57.030
And I started doing it here out of necessity with a company.

38:57.090 --> 39:00.634
Like everything else, everything else has always been a question of necessity.

39:00.694 --> 39:04.838
Who can come up to the, who can do this?

39:04.858 --> 39:05.719
Can you do this?

39:05.739 --> 39:06.500
Can you do that?

39:06.560 --> 39:08.101
Yes, I'll take it on.

39:08.121 --> 39:16.450
And so we were designing for the revival of Zuzu the first time that we did it here in San Juan.

39:16.970 --> 39:20.914
And what happened is that our costume designer was going through some

39:21.923 --> 39:51.458
health issues mental issues really because she was diagnosed schizophrenic and or bipolar and so she wasn't able to finish so I ended up having to nurse her to get you know help her along with it and ended up having to do it not the best thing because I wasn't hadn't done it you know I was just really there to help her but in the process of doing I loved it I loved

39:51.708 --> 40:00.057
being able to put clothes on, you know, to look at colors and patterns and what fits on a stage and what doesn't.

40:00.197 --> 40:08.346
And so when Luis asked me to do the costumes for Valley of the Heart here in San Juan, of course, I just, yes, why not?

40:09.567 --> 40:16.795
And then when we did it in LA, of course, then I also did it there.

40:16.855 --> 40:20.719
So based on that, I actually got a couple of offers

40:20.935 --> 40:26.081
outside of San Juan and L.A., in Chicago and in Texas.

40:27.402 --> 40:39.696
But at this point in my life, I'm not ready to... It's... That life is... I know what it's like, you know, and being away from my family and being away from home.

40:39.716 --> 40:39.816
Yeah.

40:41.558 --> 40:50.908
I don't... It's not something... I love doing it here and I love doing it with my family, but to be independent and going off somewhere by myself to do it,

40:51.901 --> 40:56.049
It's not something that I... That's not what you're doing it for.

40:56.069 --> 40:59.055
You're not doing it because you're trying to, like... Establish a career.

40:59.075 --> 41:00.938
Make a career out of it.

41:00.958 --> 41:01.560
Right, right.

41:01.640 --> 41:02.822
Yeah, right.

41:03.043 --> 41:05.387
Maybe if I had started, you know...

41:06.008 --> 41:10.512
But even so, at this point, I'm just grateful that I got to have this opportunity.

41:10.752 --> 41:18.780
I think like everything else, we try to hold on to things as if things are static and changing.

41:18.820 --> 41:20.441
It's like trying to hold on to water.

41:20.622 --> 41:21.803
You can't hold on to water.

41:22.443 --> 41:30.391
So all these experiences in your life, whatever you've had, they are part of your life, but you can't hold on to any of it.

41:34.214 --> 41:34.935
Yeah.

41:35.708 --> 41:36.849
we're all facing death.

41:38.290 --> 41:44.956
And, and so I've seen too many of my friends now and my own family.

41:44.976 --> 41:49.801
And it's, it's, you know, you, you just have to say, you know, God, thank you for this day.

41:49.941 --> 41:52.523
I'm thankful that I'm, you know, I can walk.

41:52.563 --> 42:01.251
I'm thankful I can see I, you know, so all these things you have a greater appreciation for now.

42:01.271 --> 42:03.133
I wish I had,

42:03.637 --> 42:04.539
Not wish.

42:04.719 --> 42:05.601
I can never go back.

42:06.041 --> 42:08.526
I'm just disgrateful.

42:10.770 --> 42:12.133
I can't say anything more.

42:13.134 --> 42:15.499
I miss having my family closer.

42:16.120 --> 42:19.045
I miss having that connection.

42:19.065 --> 42:23.734
I loved when all my sisters would come to visit grandma here in San Juan.

42:24.115 --> 42:24.295
Oh, yeah.

42:24.511 --> 42:26.654
You know, we take all these things for granted.

42:27.375 --> 42:29.118
That is, they're always going to be there.

42:29.939 --> 42:31.121
And they're not.

42:31.141 --> 42:32.503
They're gone before you know it.

42:32.944 --> 42:35.368
And they're gone before you oblique or not.

42:35.388 --> 42:42.018
And you look at time, and it does seem, I was just thinking about, I've been very melancholy for the last couple of days.

42:42.820 --> 42:50.772
And I was just thinking,

42:52.186 --> 42:59.533
Well, I'll tell you why it was melancholy because we just got word from the mission that we weren't, that we, they, they cemented the pews.

42:59.733 --> 43:03.076
Uh, they got new pews in the mission and they cemented the pews.

43:03.897 --> 43:14.627
And so, um, it's going to be difficult for us to be doing our Christmas shows there any longer, but the way, the manner that it felt that we couldn't do it was not very good.

43:15.308 --> 43:21.754
So just the whole idea of a tradition that's happened for over 40 years ends.

43:22.814 --> 43:24.036
But that's life.

43:24.056 --> 43:24.196
Yeah.

43:24.497 --> 43:26.860
You know, that's like a death in a family.

43:26.880 --> 43:29.524
It's like, you know, you lose someone.

43:29.945 --> 43:33.030
Your grandma once gave me this little tiny booklet.

43:33.450 --> 43:37.436
It was just a little book.

43:37.456 --> 43:43.906
She used to work for the medical visiting people, and she would work for the health department.

43:44.347 --> 43:47.271
Anyway, this book, it says Family Ties and Bind.

43:48.052 --> 43:48.433
Have you read it?

43:48.616 --> 43:48.996
No.

43:49.357 --> 43:53.642
It's a little booklet she gave me, and it's like a little mobile.

43:54.763 --> 43:59.729
And we're part of this mobile, this family.

44:00.510 --> 44:06.837
And when one piece falls off, it takes a while for it to balance again, a little balance.

44:07.738 --> 44:09.360
And that's how we're tied together.

44:09.500 --> 44:14.185
It's like we're a part of this mobile, and that we have to adjust to

44:14.620 --> 44:16.903
someone you lose in your family.

44:17.223 --> 44:20.147
Well, it's kind of like that with the mission.

44:20.688 --> 44:28.779
It's like losing, not that it's equivalent to a family member passing.

44:28.799 --> 44:30.741
But there's a relationship there.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.245
It's over 40 years.

44:33.925 --> 44:37.430
And so it feels like another death.

44:38.351 --> 44:41.235
And so you think, okay, now how do I adjust to that?

44:41.958 --> 44:42.939
And you have to.

44:43.220 --> 44:45.323
You adjust to all these things in life.

44:45.343 --> 44:46.885
And we don't know how.

44:47.225 --> 44:49.308
I love that poem by Netza Walcoyal.

44:49.448 --> 44:51.952
No para siempre en la tierra, solo un poco aquí.

44:52.112 --> 44:52.393
Yeah.

44:53.134 --> 44:55.898
And, you know, that's really what life is.

44:55.918 --> 44:56.038
Right.

44:56.058 --> 45:00.364
We're just here for a short... And it just feels like a blink of an eye.

45:00.484 --> 45:01.806
I was thinking of my mother, too.

45:01.866 --> 45:07.434
That's... Because my dad was... We were doing the weekend show there in the mission.

45:07.894 --> 45:08.876
I don't know if you remember.

45:08.996 --> 45:09.717
You were too young.

45:10.518 --> 45:10.638
Yeah.

45:10.658 --> 45:11.239
This was...

45:11.793 --> 45:19.303
My dad was... Well, he died in 92, so it would have been... 82.

45:19.323 --> 45:21.205
82, I'm sorry.

45:21.265 --> 45:23.248
82, 92.

45:23.268 --> 45:25.931
My mom died in 95, so it's 82.

45:26.011 --> 45:33.882
So that was... That's... What is it?

45:33.902 --> 45:34.322
13.

45:36.545 --> 45:36.765
Huh?

45:36.785 --> 45:37.366
13 years?

45:37.827 --> 45:38.868
Is that what you're... No, no.

45:38.888 --> 45:39.589
Between the...

45:39.890 --> 45:40.872
Oh, no, no, 13.

45:41.112 --> 45:46.322
No, but since he died, it would be 38 years.

45:47.524 --> 45:48.425
Oh, to today.

45:48.486 --> 45:48.866
Yes.

45:52.573 --> 45:53.074
38?

45:53.114 --> 45:53.274
Yeah.

45:54.957 --> 45:56.340
My mother, 24 years.

45:56.861 --> 46:00.748
And yet, you know, when you think about it, it just feels like yesterday.

46:00.768 --> 46:02.391
Yeah.

46:02.411 --> 46:03.092
You know?

46:03.112 --> 46:04.294
And that's what time is.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.584
Oh, we were talking about Chicana stuff.

46:07.604 --> 46:08.004
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:08.325 --> 46:09.587
No, no, this is good.

46:09.627 --> 46:10.448
This is good, too.

46:12.150 --> 46:19.160
And, I mean, it's good because you can kind of see that same kind of, I mean, it's a philosophy, right?

46:19.180 --> 46:24.949
And you can kind of see that in your approach to, you know, to your costume designing.

46:25.049 --> 46:28.814
And, you know, something happened, you had to step in there.

46:28.854 --> 46:29.455
Mm-hmm.

46:29.654 --> 46:33.941
And, you know, you found something that you love to do.

46:33.961 --> 46:34.142
Yeah.

46:34.342 --> 46:44.119
Or, you know, you're having to what you thought you could rely on didn't, you know, turned out that you couldn't rely on that.

46:44.179 --> 46:47.144
And so you have to kind of readjust, readjust.

46:47.164 --> 46:48.146
Yeah.

46:48.166 --> 46:49.468
And I think that's about it.

46:49.972 --> 46:53.519
uh, they say AA is about attitude adjustment.

46:54.480 --> 46:55.803
I think that's what it stands for.

46:56.344 --> 46:58.548
That's what somebody said is the attitude adjustment.

46:58.588 --> 47:05.381
And I think that that's kind of, um, uh, that's really, really, uh, life.

47:06.603 --> 47:09.007
You have to do, it's an attitude adjustment.

47:09.809 --> 47:13.195
I started going to Al-Anon, uh, about, um,

47:16.280 --> 47:18.262
12 years ago, 13 years ago.

47:19.344 --> 47:34.382
And it's given me so much working on myself because I thought I was, well, you know, I grew up in an alcoholic home, you know.

47:35.383 --> 47:39.148
And so, did you stop it?

47:39.415 --> 47:40.757
No.

47:40.837 --> 47:41.839
No, do you want me to?

47:41.859 --> 47:43.281
No, no, no, no, it's okay.

47:43.622 --> 47:48.810
But anyway, it's helped me tremendously to work on myself.

47:48.830 --> 47:53.978
And, you know, I never had the luxury of, you know, therapy or any of those things.

47:54.078 --> 47:54.439
Right.

47:55.701 --> 48:03.594
It is a form of therapy in a way, but it's like working on yourself, identifying yourself.

48:03.954 --> 48:05.777
You know, I think when you're young,

48:06.837 --> 48:12.004
And you're still being molded as to how you're going to live your life.

48:12.645 --> 48:23.359
You really don't know because things change for you from one time or another, something that you have to readjust your life.

48:23.780 --> 48:23.960
Yeah.

48:24.101 --> 48:25.983
And so it's a question.

48:26.003 --> 48:28.887
It really is trying to find your balance at all times.

48:28.907 --> 48:31.471
And it doesn't matter how old you are or how young you are.

48:31.911 --> 48:34.074
You're always trying to find your balance.

48:35.997 --> 48:36.237
Yeah.

48:37.550 --> 48:48.170
So let me just kind of ask one more question about the Chicano movement stuff and then we'll move into the mestizaje stuff.

48:48.851 --> 48:56.065
But so kind of to go back to that idea of, you know, the Teatro Campesino thing.

48:56.602 --> 48:58.664
bringing a message, right?

48:59.725 --> 49:22.550
And in many ways, I kind of connect this to like what you guys were doing and the message that you guys were bringing into different Chicano communities is what, you know, departments like Chicano studies or, you know, ethnic studies are doing today in the academy.

49:22.570 --> 49:22.710
Mm-hmm.

49:22.893 --> 49:41.391
And so I wanted to know if you had anything, like, did you see what you guys were doing as part of kind of like an educational mission or not a mission, but that that's what you guys were doing was kind of spreading, spreading the word.

49:41.894 --> 49:54.435
About what it means to be Chicano, about the history, about having a particular identity that you guys have created or that, you know, that is being created in the Chicano movement.

49:55.647 --> 50:05.882
Well, you know, when we first started, when I first started taking a class at Fresno State and Luis was teaching it, there was no books at the time.

50:06.382 --> 50:14.273
There was no authors that did a published book that you could say referenced this.

50:16.457 --> 50:20.322
What his first class did in La Raza, it was called La Raza,

50:20.673 --> 50:44.154
was that he mimeographed a lot of the things that hadn't been published, like Rofo Lanaya's... I mean, a lot of these that hadn't been published, they were sent to Luis, and he mimeographed them and became part of this anthology they put together with Stan Steiner.

50:46.216 --> 50:47.697
Is that published somewhere?

50:47.717 --> 50:48.418
It's...

50:48.533 --> 50:50.955
Somebody have a copy of it?

50:50.975 --> 50:51.195
Oh, yeah.

50:51.215 --> 50:52.457
We have a copy upstairs.

50:52.557 --> 50:53.057
Oh, you do?

50:53.077 --> 50:53.878
Oh, yeah.

50:54.278 --> 50:55.840
Because it's out of print.

50:56.160 --> 50:56.380
Yeah.

50:56.460 --> 51:00.384
So I'll bring them down to you so you can see them.

51:00.844 --> 51:03.707
But, yeah, I don't even know if they're available.

51:04.067 --> 51:15.378
They should be available in colleges and universities, especially where... But that was the very first book, Anthology of Mexican-American Literature, that was ever published.

51:15.538 --> 51:18.000
And that was...

51:18.470 --> 51:27.304
So he mimeographed a lot of the things that became part of the book and was part of the class that he taught.

51:27.384 --> 51:34.415
So it was at the frontier of when things were happening because nothing else was happening at the time.

51:35.176 --> 51:44.190
There was no Chicano movement, theater movement, first, that you might say, when they went to...

51:45.200 --> 51:48.804
to crusade for justice in Denver, Colorado.

51:48.864 --> 51:52.667
It was the first youth conference to take place.

51:52.828 --> 51:56.731
And that was in 19, I believe it, that was in 1966, 67.

52:00.355 --> 52:10.885
And that's when they came up with the, what was it?

52:10.905 --> 52:13.468
I'm not a historian.

52:14.984 --> 52:16.546
Oh, yeah, yeah.

52:16.767 --> 52:28.164
And so that was put together by a group, by committee that came together there at the youth conference in Denver with Corky.

52:28.845 --> 52:34.413
And of course, that's when they had met Corky on the national tour.

52:35.014 --> 52:42.966
They went from Delano after the march.

52:43.351 --> 52:46.976
So, yeah, you're going back.

52:49.679 --> 52:51.301
That's interesting.

52:51.321 --> 52:56.067
It's like a time capsule that goes back, you know, like, what is it, 50 years?

52:56.387 --> 52:56.668
Yeah.

52:56.688 --> 52:57.449
We're talking 50 years.

52:57.469 --> 52:58.430
50 years.

52:59.051 --> 53:00.633
So.

53:01.133 --> 53:01.594
At least.

53:01.834 --> 53:03.296
At least more than that, yeah.

53:03.577 --> 53:08.503
It'll be 55 years since Delano, the mainstream.

53:08.583 --> 53:08.683
Yeah.

53:09.237 --> 53:11.261
A grape stripe, yeah.

53:11.982 --> 53:13.325
I think that happened in 64.

53:13.505 --> 53:13.766
Yeah.

53:15.168 --> 53:22.242
But I mean, the March to Sacramento was in 65.

53:22.663 --> 53:25.508
Anyway, was it 65?

53:26.399 --> 53:28.602
Somewhere around there.

53:28.763 --> 53:30.766
Yeah, it was $60.

53:30.866 --> 53:33.330
To be honest, I don't know.

53:33.410 --> 53:36.194
I don't have the internet yet.

53:36.214 --> 53:37.096
Oh, you don't?

53:37.216 --> 53:39.619
No, I'll get it when we're done.

53:40.281 --> 53:42.484
Okay.

53:43.706 --> 53:54.162
Part of the reason I wanted to ask you about that is because I think it was my mom who mentioned that

53:54.682 --> 54:09.502
that not only were you guys performing like in communities, but that there were maybe like invitations to perform in universities or from different departments and universities.

54:10.543 --> 54:21.938
And so, and I think she mentioned something about like that you guys would make videos and give them to, or I don't know about give them, but yeah.

54:22.070 --> 54:24.994
that they would be provided to those universities?

54:25.014 --> 54:26.956
Actually, in those days, there was no video.

54:27.057 --> 54:30.041
It was actually 16-millimeter film.

54:30.521 --> 54:41.796
And that's... I Am Joaquin was really... We used to sell those in the big reel-to-reels, the big 16-millimeter... Yeah, because that was the only thing we had.

54:41.816 --> 54:45.821
There was no... Before there was video, there was VHS.

54:46.282 --> 54:47.824
And then it was...

54:47.973 --> 54:48.995
DVDs.

54:49.455 --> 54:53.501
But in those times, the only way of community, there was no way.

54:53.521 --> 54:55.404
We didn't have the internet then.

54:55.485 --> 55:00.292
So we had, it was to transfer, you know, we used to rent these.

55:00.893 --> 55:04.478
And we did I Am Joaquin in Fresno.

55:05.780 --> 55:08.765
It was George Ballas who filmed it.

55:08.785 --> 55:11.669
It was part of Jose Montoya's poem.

55:13.873 --> 55:15.415
Well, no, that's Little Louie.

55:15.732 --> 55:26.989
We used to do it as an acto with live music and reading Corky's poem.

55:27.009 --> 55:31.596
And so George Bala says this would be a great film, short film.

55:31.616 --> 55:41.390
So he shot it in his kitchen by using rear projection with like a window.

55:42.412 --> 55:45.216
You could see the slide and anyway,

55:45.618 --> 55:47.120
Very arcade.

55:48.081 --> 55:53.046
And that's how it was shot, so that you could have sort of like a movement, because there were all his photographs.

55:54.068 --> 55:58.152
George Ballons' photographs with the music, and of course we did the narration on it.

55:58.793 --> 56:09.826
But yeah, that was done in Fresno, and I believe that was done in 69, 68, 69.

56:10.046 --> 56:15.372
And yeah, but it was, we used to sell them and rent them

56:15.807 --> 56:43.435
to colleges and universities and libraries yeah so that's interesting to me too because that's another part of what I'm going over in my dissertation is how did how did like some of the ideas from the Chicano movement become entrenched or

56:44.039 --> 57:07.144
part of academic discourse on you know on these things well because there's no materials available that there was so so we had to create not only the books but the films and the short films that were created actually uh i am walking uh the short film is is in the library of congress now is one of

57:09.588 --> 57:10.549
Luis will tell you.

57:10.569 --> 57:13.332
That's, you know, he has dates.

57:14.053 --> 57:20.761
But that one, and we did Little Louie.

57:20.841 --> 57:22.303
I've never heard of that one.

57:23.745 --> 57:25.046
And Louie, not Little Louie.

57:25.127 --> 57:36.020
Little Louie is actually a short film that our sons did with their dad because he describes the story of how he got involved into theater.

57:36.620 --> 57:37.441
And he tells that.

57:37.461 --> 57:38.903
So it's called Little Louie.

57:39.237 --> 57:49.108
But El Luis, Jose Montoya, we also did that as a... Well, it's recorded as a 45.

57:49.389 --> 57:53.694
It wasn't done in a video, but that was a recording that we did.

57:56.096 --> 58:07.810
But the short film was that... And then, of course, we did the Pastorella for PBS and El Corrido, Passion of Revolution.

58:08.684 --> 58:11.787
Tales of Passion and Revolution that won a Peabody Award.

58:12.367 --> 58:20.755
So a lot of that, all that educational material probably was based out of what the Jephthah did.

58:22.476 --> 58:24.798
Okay.

58:24.818 --> 58:25.399
Let me see.

58:25.419 --> 58:30.243
I'm just trying to think if there's anything else I want to ask about that before we move on.

58:33.726 --> 58:35.868
No.

58:35.908 --> 58:38.050
I got through all these questions.

58:38.435 --> 59:03.497
um okay so the next the second question i have is about messy sawhead are you familiar at all with messy sawhead that idea what do you know about it what do i know other than then uh then uh the group that came uh

59:04.962 --> 59:05.302
No.

59:07.845 --> 59:11.188
I'm not quite sure what your definition of mestizaje is.

59:11.809 --> 59:15.373
Mestizaje is kind of like the umbrella term.

59:15.573 --> 59:18.796
Another word you might use for it is mestizo.

59:20.618 --> 59:22.560
What does that mean to be mestizo?

59:24.542 --> 59:30.168
Do you have any understanding of what that is, mestizo?

59:30.248 --> 59:30.328
Yes.

59:30.528 --> 59:42.942
Well, I think that part of the whole idea with the Chicano movement was really identity and finding the Indian and the Spanish is the mestizaje.

59:42.982 --> 59:52.433
The mestizo was born out of the combination of indigenous America identifying with it.

59:52.453 --> 59:59.100
You know, it's so complex that...

59:59.249 --> 01:00:01.631
These are all terms that people use.

01:00:02.993 --> 01:00:16.126
You know, the bottom line is we're all human beings, you know, whether we want to call ourselves Mexican, Chicano, Latino X, Mestizo, whatever it is, it's the bottom line.

01:00:17.287 --> 01:00:19.509
We're only here for a short time in this life.

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:26.016
And so if it helps to identify with it, that's fine.

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:28.520
but it's not who I am.

01:00:29.582 --> 01:00:35.190
I mean, I think I'm more than a term or I'm spirit.

01:00:36.953 --> 01:00:53.016
So you would say that when you hear that term mestizo or mestizaje, that it doesn't necessarily say anything about how you identify, but you know, like everything,

01:00:53.468 --> 01:01:05.588
In life, things change, and even the way you think about things, you know, how you see, you know, you can see, any person can see something totally different.

01:01:06.631 --> 01:01:10.196
I can tell you one thing and you will not see it the same way I see it.

01:01:11.278 --> 01:01:15.744
And I can identify with a word and you will not be able to identify with it.

01:01:15.764 --> 01:01:18.027
We all see things differently.

01:01:18.047 --> 01:01:20.971
And that's the beauty of it.

01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:25.558
Where do we bridge that so that we can understand each other?

01:01:26.158 --> 01:01:32.868
If you're not able to see what I see or I'm not able to see what you see, how do we come together?

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:35.912
And that to me...

01:01:39.368 --> 01:01:41.893
I'll tell you what my philosophy is.

01:01:41.913 --> 01:01:44.477
We're only here in this life to love and to forgive.

01:01:45.579 --> 01:01:47.122
That's all.

01:01:47.142 --> 01:01:48.164
That's where I'm at now.

01:01:48.865 --> 01:01:55.457
Where I was 50 years ago is a totally different person than I am today.

01:01:57.541 --> 01:01:59.605
So...

01:01:59.888 --> 01:02:07.737
I think, well, I mean, your kind of description or understanding of what mestizo mestizaje is.

01:02:09.039 --> 01:02:11.281
It's pretty consistent with most people.

01:02:13.784 --> 01:02:19.611
But I'm wondering, like, where do you think you learned about that?

01:02:20.672 --> 01:02:26.259
Was it something that you learned from being a part of the Chicano movement?

01:02:26.299 --> 01:02:29.102
Or was it something that you were aware of?

01:02:29.453 --> 01:02:55.309
before that no yeah i i it would have to be with the chicano movement is is we were trying to identify who we were uh um you know identity is something that is always it's in constant flux because we're always re reinventing ourselves we're re-identifying who we are i'm not 20 years old

01:02:55.492 --> 01:03:06.784
And that's an identity that you establish or when you're 30 or when you're 40 or when you're 50 or when you get to 70, you know.

01:03:07.388 --> 01:03:11.493
Each one has its own identity, and you identify with seniors.

01:03:11.593 --> 01:03:13.615
I identify with seniors now.

01:03:13.775 --> 01:03:15.117
What can I say?

01:03:15.137 --> 01:03:16.799
I identify with Michael Males.

01:03:17.079 --> 01:03:18.861
We're on a spiritual path.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.743
We're on a spiritual journey.

01:03:21.785 --> 01:03:25.329
I think I've always been on a spiritual journey my whole life.

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:29.373
I know when I was 16 years old, I wanted to become a nun.

01:03:30.434 --> 01:03:33.498
Now, it's a dying breed.

01:03:33.678 --> 01:03:35.320
No one is...

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:40.970
Anyway, it's your identity when you're at, at your age and time.

01:03:43.092 --> 01:03:46.896
Mestizo is something I learned when I was in my 20s.

01:03:47.276 --> 01:03:49.278
It was something that I could identify with.

01:03:49.779 --> 01:03:53.202
It was something that I could appreciate in that time.

01:03:54.183 --> 01:03:56.225
Does it identify me now?

01:03:56.245 --> 01:03:58.227
Not necessarily.

01:03:59.267 --> 01:04:03.271
What I identify now is just living on this planet.

01:04:03.952 --> 01:04:04.092
Mm-hmm.

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:31.935
taking care of this planet, taking care of my loved ones, being... Some of the philosophies, especially Mayan scholars, that in the 80s when we were learning and having these class sessions, and I'm sure you're

01:04:32.506 --> 01:04:35.870
Your mom and dad told you about what we were learning then.

01:04:37.232 --> 01:04:45.303
Some Mayan principles, which are indigenous in Lakesh, and now everyone is using it.

01:04:49.708 --> 01:05:01.804
You know, menya, that term, you know, to create, to love, to believe, to create, to do with love and pain, that's work, and that's menya.

01:05:02.071 --> 01:05:07.780
Is that like M-E-N... How do you spell that?

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.180
Menya.

01:05:08.621 --> 01:05:10.944
M-E-N-Y-A-H.

01:05:11.846 --> 01:05:13.368
Menya.

01:05:13.769 --> 01:05:18.276
And you know, Inlakesh, you are my other self.

01:05:18.476 --> 01:05:21.360
If I love and respect you, I love and respect myself.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.305
If I do harm to you, I do harm to myself.

01:05:24.325 --> 01:05:28.010
And that's such a universal principle in any religion.

01:05:28.852 --> 01:05:29.192
And...

01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:36.525
For me, religion is separate from spirituality because religion can contain your spirit.

01:05:37.927 --> 01:05:41.393
It tries and it thinks it does, but it doesn't.

01:05:41.653 --> 01:05:42.975
Your spirit is free.

01:05:43.196 --> 01:05:43.937
It's your own.

01:05:44.538 --> 01:05:46.942
No one can take that away from you.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:51.249
No one can tell you how to believe, when to believe, who to believe.

01:05:52.711 --> 01:05:56.277
But, you know, if I love and respect you,

01:05:56.982 --> 01:05:58.524
I can love and respect myself.

01:05:58.764 --> 01:06:01.587
If I do harm to you, I can do harm to myself.

01:06:02.649 --> 01:06:16.785
So, you know, these are really strong indigenous principles that we learn then and still apply to me now because they're truths that never change.

01:06:16.805 --> 01:06:25.015
So... So are you tying that into, like, the... Yes.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:36.450
Becoming aware that we have in our beings that we have this history and this identity that relates to these kinds of principles.

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:37.131
Exactly.

01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:37.632
Okay.

01:06:37.812 --> 01:06:39.014
And that still apply.

01:06:39.034 --> 01:06:47.205
To me, those apply more than the term Chicano because that in itself will, whether it'll be...

01:06:47.978 --> 01:06:50.240
An asterisk in somebody's history book.

01:06:51.882 --> 01:06:55.566
In the same way, Latina X will be an asterisk in somebody's history book.

01:06:55.766 --> 01:06:56.427
Yeah.

01:06:57.408 --> 01:07:02.053
But the deep, profound teachings will never be an asterisk.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:02.733
Yeah.

01:07:02.773 --> 01:07:07.058
Because those are really, I mean, to me, they speak the truth.

01:07:07.378 --> 01:07:10.902
They have spoken to the truth from then to now.

01:07:11.783 --> 01:07:12.163
Mm-hmm.

01:07:12.397 --> 01:07:13.719
That's interesting.

01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:39.332
My dad and I were just talking about this yesterday that you know this idea that that there is a profound or there's a profound connection to our indigenous roots and spiritualities and

01:07:39.667 --> 01:08:09.268
and ways of knowing things and that you know all this other stuff all this you know it's very kind of like performative or symbol symbolism right the naming the language stuff but that what is more important is that these lessons these values remain right or i mean that's the hope is that those things remain um that that is the actual kind of like prize not

01:08:09.468 --> 01:08:16.094
you know, are we being recognized for being Latinx or whatever, right?

01:08:16.434 --> 01:08:19.016
So, yeah, I think that's really, really interesting.

01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:27.784
The mestizo stuff, so you said that you kind of became more aware of it in your 20s, right?

01:08:28.144 --> 01:08:39.154
Right, that was, we were doing Dominguez Martinez Paredes is a Mayan scholar who wrote about, who had about

01:08:39.691 --> 01:08:51.065
10 books that were given to him by the mascarones when we were doing interchange with them, with Mariano Leyva.

01:08:51.866 --> 01:08:54.990
And that's how Luis came across these books.

01:08:55.711 --> 01:08:59.556
And so they were all in Spanish.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:04.983
Of course, no one here, no one in our group was really into Spanish and reading.

01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:09.028
Well, I mean, you know, these are scholarly books in Spanish.

01:09:09.088 --> 01:09:09.208
Right.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:16.189
And so it was Louise who read them and interpreted them for us and taught them to us.

01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:36.118
And it was one of those, you know, when we were here in San Juan at the very beginning in the participation, we used to have nightly classes in our home, where Louise would conduct kind of like history lessons for the group, which would introduce a lot.

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:39.583
We even did Babaran Das's book,

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:47.718
the gospel of St.

01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:56.458
John, according to Bob Arondas, it's an existential way out.

01:09:57.039 --> 01:09:58.382
He was into

01:09:59.155 --> 01:10:00.997
LSD and stuff like that.

01:10:01.638 --> 01:10:03.239
So he was way out there.

01:10:03.279 --> 01:10:07.384
But anyway, we studied different philosophies and stuff.

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:11.288
But that's when we were introduced to Dominguez Parezo.

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:17.995
And Inlakesh and Menya and Naviolin and Olteo.

01:10:18.095 --> 01:10:29.027
And part of the workshop that was established is the Theater of the Sphere, which was dealing with...

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:53.260
indigenous, um, the Vente Pasos, uh, in the Aztec calendar, uh, uh, can describe the heart, the mind, the soul, and we did exercises to develop those things, um, which actually still are being practiced, um, which could, you know, that, um,

01:10:53.746 --> 01:11:01.815
We want to, there's, Luis has put a workshop book together and, and it should be published at one point and probably will.

01:11:01.875 --> 01:11:06.741
I don't know when, but, um, actually he, he's written.

01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:08.042
Oh, that's enough.

01:11:08.062 --> 01:11:08.763
He can tell you that.

01:11:09.244 --> 01:11:09.844
Oh, there he is.

01:11:11.766 --> 01:11:12.527
You're up.

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:13.689
Hello.

01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:15.150
Good morning.

01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:16.472
Oh, afternoon.

01:11:16.492 --> 01:11:17.573
I don't know what it is.

01:11:17.613 --> 01:11:18.454
Morning.

01:11:18.788 --> 01:11:19.654
Good to see you.

01:11:19.815 --> 01:11:20.539
Good to see you.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.875
You having a good conversation?

01:11:22.895 --> 01:11:24.968
Yeah, actually we are.

01:11:26.028 --> 01:11:36.737
So that guy, I'll ask Luis, I'll ask him a little bit more, but the Paredes guy is Paredes?

01:11:36.757 --> 01:11:37.698
Yeah, Paredes.

01:11:37.718 --> 01:11:40.000
So he was a Mayan scholar.

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.201
Oh, a Mayan scholar?

01:11:41.261 --> 01:11:41.561
Yeah.

01:11:41.581 --> 01:11:42.082
Okay.

01:11:42.102 --> 01:11:42.923
But from Mexico.

01:11:43.043 --> 01:11:44.003
From Mexico, yeah.

01:11:44.444 --> 01:11:45.725
And he's passed away.

01:11:47.246 --> 01:11:55.073
Somebody told us recently that somebody published these books under their personal

01:11:55.627 --> 01:12:21.297
name rather than they oh really yeah because you know he he was kicked out of the university because of his his his ideas and of course you know they always look at the white anthropologist right the Mexican anthropologist you know yeah so anyway his ideas were fully that is a that is a big problem and still a problem in academia

01:12:21.732 --> 01:12:48.094
um okay that's good uh let me see if there was anything else i wanted to ask oh um okay so you told me that you kind of you learned about some of this stuff in in your 20s and do you know like so it's interesting because you're talking about there that you guys would have some kind of a

01:12:48.547 --> 01:12:52.091
Like a learning group or a learning circle or something like that, right?

01:12:52.111 --> 01:12:54.254
Where you would read books and learn about stuff.

01:12:55.014 --> 01:13:02.663
And so can you recall where you learned about mestizaje or mestizo?

01:13:02.683 --> 01:13:03.804
Well, it was part of this.

01:13:06.067 --> 01:13:10.472
With the sessions that we had at night and the workshops that we did.

01:13:11.373 --> 01:13:13.035
So applying...

01:13:13.775 --> 01:13:23.110
the methodology of what was in the books and incorporating them into a workshop so that we could

01:13:24.929 --> 01:13:47.258
you know, we'd have, and doing the theater of the sphere, we use a soccer ball in order to represent the sphere and the movements, and our whole body is a sphere as we move our heads, our arms, our legs, and so just identifying, looking more into your internal soul, and this beating heart of us, you know.

01:13:47.592 --> 01:14:13.093
exercises where we use the ball as part of the exercises being our heart and bringing it to somebody else it's these gestures are so profound if you it's like whatever you put into you know whatever you put into your studies whatever you put into your work whatever it is that you do if you invest your whole nature your whole self into it

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:18.878
you get so much more out of it than just sitting there and saying, oh, God, when is this going to be over?

01:14:19.479 --> 01:14:23.265
Rather than invest, you know, when it is that you're doing.

01:14:23.286 --> 01:14:37.269
So I think all of these, you know, sessions that we had in the evening to study mind philosophy, the workshops that we did, were all really integrated in the work that we did.

01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.170
Mm-hmm.

01:14:38.673 --> 01:14:51.330
Was there, out of, so you're talking a lot about like the Mayan kind of, the Mayan principles.

01:14:52.772 --> 01:14:58.460
Do you recall any specifically Mestizaje principles, Mestizo?

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:08.494
Well, I, you know, if you have done a Mestizo with anything, Mestizo is a combination, it's like a whole,

01:15:08.727 --> 01:15:36.996
pot that you put in your Mexican and your indigenous and you put whatever it is you do your your lineage you can you can you can say you're scotinavian you can say whatever any any your blood whatever your blood comes from all um where do you what is it that you intuitively know

01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:48.085
What, when will you say something, when you say, ah, you have an epiphany and say, yes, I understand it completely or no, I don't understand any of it.

01:15:48.445 --> 01:15:50.368
It has makes no sense whatsoever.

01:15:50.908 --> 01:15:57.798
And sometimes it's your gut that informs you and tells you, yes, this is, this is what I believe this is.

01:15:59.140 --> 01:15:59.420
Yeah.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.722
And beliefs change.

01:16:01.175 --> 01:16:08.588
I think I'm thinking more like, because we had talked about Corky's poem, right?

01:16:08.608 --> 01:16:25.478
And there's a lot in Corky's poem that talks about, you know, this new, the Chicano that is born from the Spanish conqueror and the indigenous, you know,

01:16:25.576 --> 01:16:27.618
owner of this land, basically.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.105
And so I was just wondering, did you guys read that?

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:34.947
Was that part of that circle?

01:16:35.628 --> 01:16:42.916
Or was it somebody else, like a Vasconcelos, because you were reading Mexican literature and stuff?

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:51.786
Well, Vasconcelos is something that I didn't read, so I can't talk about that.

01:16:53.673 --> 01:16:59.358
What we did study was Domingo Martinez Carreras.

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:06.564
But not, I mean, there wasn't much written in those days.

01:17:06.724 --> 01:17:10.607
There wasn't resource materials that you could go to.

01:17:11.068 --> 01:17:12.229
Not like you have today.

01:17:12.809 --> 01:17:18.834
So even literature, Chicano literature, wasn't prevalent and it wasn't published.

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:22.518
If you needed to find anything, you'd have to talk to them personally.

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:23.038
Yeah.

01:17:23.204 --> 01:17:27.171
in order to get some poems or whatever.

01:17:27.191 --> 01:17:35.786
It's like the early pieces in La Raza and Dan Steiner and the book that Mestizo, which is what it's called.

01:17:35.806 --> 01:17:43.059
Anyway, it was like the great frontier in those days.

01:17:43.299 --> 01:17:44.902
There was nothing.

01:17:44.922 --> 01:17:45.904
So you sort of had to

01:17:47.015 --> 01:18:09.107
reinvent everything or create things for yourself in order to do it and it's still the same thing now i mean it hasn't changed except now that you know media has taken a dominant force you know the internet the social media i mean that's where you get all your information now yeah whereas before there was no cell phones there were no

01:18:09.779 --> 01:18:14.584
you know, where you can say, oh, I have to find out what this means, Google it.

01:18:14.604 --> 01:18:15.005
Right, right.

01:18:15.025 --> 01:18:20.351
So now it's like, we take this for granted that it's always been there.

01:18:20.371 --> 01:18:34.487
It was, I can understand why, you know, when the great coming, you know, across, you know, to California, how just going across the

01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:43.259
It just, it's boggles the mind to think that there was nothing, especially in those days, nothing really about Chicanos that was written.

01:18:43.539 --> 01:18:47.904
I think we kind of created that, coined it and made it popular.

01:18:49.065 --> 01:18:49.406
Yeah.

01:18:50.988 --> 01:18:51.088
Yeah.

01:18:51.108 --> 01:19:01.319
Um, I think actually I do have one kind of like main question I want to get through before we take a break.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.222
We kind of wrap up here.

01:19:03.242 --> 01:19:04.063
Yeah.

01:19:04.083 --> 01:19:04.423
Um,

01:19:04.943 --> 01:19:24.100
So one of the things that I heard both my mom and dad say about mestizaje was that whether they identified with it or not, was that it was something that

01:19:25.109 --> 01:19:35.920
just seemed to be like common sense or like a general understanding within the Mexican community.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:54.559
So that it wasn't necessarily, oh, somebody came and they wrote a lecture on mestizaje and they distributed it to everybody, but that it was something that people just as a community, being Mexican-American, Chicano, whatever,

01:19:55.113 --> 01:20:01.883
that there was some sort of like an understanding about it.

01:20:02.524 --> 01:20:10.416
Well, you know, when you... So that when you encountered it later or, you know, in your 20s, that it somehow resonated.

01:20:11.217 --> 01:20:23.635
Well, I think, you know, growing up, you know, in like we, you know, in the San Joaquin Valley and growing up in the history that we have, you know,

01:20:25.268 --> 01:20:33.277
There was no such thing as identifying with the Mexican side of your life.

01:20:33.457 --> 01:20:37.282
I mean, other than that you grew up in the barrio.

01:20:37.362 --> 01:20:51.057
It's like a piece of clay that still hasn't formed yet.

01:20:51.627 --> 01:21:09.094
We were really just a lump of clay that we're sort of looking into and creating something out of nothing because it was nothing other than being Mexican and being Mexican-American.

01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:20.031
And being Mexican-American, the connotation was that if you were Mexican-American, you were a salab, meaning that you didn't identify with your own people.

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:31.776
which is kind of the same thing that's happening now because you have a lot of Latinos or Mexicanos that identify with Trump, and you say, how can you think that way?

01:21:31.796 --> 01:21:33.118
Where is your mentality?

01:21:35.301 --> 01:21:47.318
It's kind of the same way where people who identify being Mexican-American, you said those were the ones that wanted to assimilate into the dominant culture and become the other.

01:21:47.787 --> 01:22:01.584
So when you became self-aware that, you know, things weren't as equitable as you thought they were, that there was a lot of discrimination and racism even then.

01:22:02.666 --> 01:22:02.826
Yeah.

01:22:02.986 --> 01:22:15.482
I can remember a time when my father in Arosi, when we went to the football field, there was an event taking place, and being a little kid, I was hungry, and

01:22:15.985 --> 01:22:19.228
They were giving away hot dogs as an incentive for whatever.

01:22:19.328 --> 01:22:20.029
I don't remember.

01:22:20.069 --> 01:22:21.330
I was still too young.

01:22:21.711 --> 01:22:25.975
And I remember being there with my dad and I say, I want to eat away.

01:22:25.995 --> 01:22:33.763
So he went up to the concession stand and asked in his broken English or, or in Spanish.

01:22:33.923 --> 01:22:36.265
I can remember that his daughter was hungry.

01:22:37.166 --> 01:22:39.008
And that woman saying, do you see that sign?

01:22:39.248 --> 01:22:44.153
It says not until six o'clock denying

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:48.356
Like, can't you speak English?

01:22:48.657 --> 01:22:49.617
Don't you read?

01:22:50.578 --> 01:22:51.780
It's always happened.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.800
It's always been there.

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:57.085
So you grew up with that racism.

01:22:58.466 --> 01:23:00.628
You stayed with your own class.

01:23:00.688 --> 01:23:02.109
You stayed with your own people.

01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:07.274
You didn't go anywhere that you didn't belong.

01:23:08.656 --> 01:23:14.241
Even when I was in high school, I remember there was this young Anglo...

01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:25.024
boy that had a well i i don't know he had a crush on me or what but he made it obvious that he was interested in me and i just could not

01:23:26.033 --> 01:23:54.218
identify with yeah um so you see it's all internal too we we do we we we internalize that racism ourselves i didn't think i was racist but at the same time i didn't feel like i could identify with the other person so we have that anyway but i think growing up is is we saw enough of it to say something's not right here i don't want to be like that person

01:23:54.603 --> 01:24:02.452
I don't want to deny a little kid something to eat because your father can't speak English or can't read or whatever.

01:24:02.872 --> 01:24:08.979
But it was the tone of voice and the attitude that I'll never forget, even to this day.

01:24:08.999 --> 01:24:17.448
So those things are so embedded in you so that when you start saying, well, I can be proud to be Mexican.

01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:21.032
I can say, I'm...

01:24:21.451 --> 01:24:24.795
You know, I'm a human being with, you know.

01:24:24.895 --> 01:24:25.195
Dignity.

01:24:25.355 --> 01:24:26.617
Yeah, with dignity.

01:24:26.637 --> 01:24:31.622
So, so you, you grow up, when you grow up that way, you say, you know what?

01:24:31.642 --> 01:24:32.723
Things have to change.

01:24:33.044 --> 01:24:43.114
If not for you, I mean, if for them, for you yourself, so that you don't become a racist yourself, so that you can treat others.

01:24:43.795 --> 01:24:44.296
That's why.

01:24:44.336 --> 01:24:46.018
Exactly.

01:24:46.258 --> 01:24:50.142
It's that, you know, when something like that comes, um,

01:24:51.235 --> 01:25:11.604
I mean, even Christ in this, yeah, I can't tell if I'm with the, the, uh, well, anyway, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's all in, it's a, actually it's universal in all spiritual, but not, I don't want, I hate religion.

01:25:11.744 --> 01:25:13.407
I hate the idea.

01:25:13.467 --> 01:25:15.489
Like the institution of it.

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.650
Yeah.

01:25:15.670 --> 01:25:18.694
The spiritual concepts have always been there.

01:25:18.944 --> 01:25:25.874
with everyone, whether you're Islam or, you know, with Buddha, with Jesus, with anyone else.

01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:28.679
They all have the same basic principle.

01:25:28.739 --> 01:25:33.426
Treat others with respect and love as the way you want to be treated.

01:25:33.446 --> 01:25:38.594
So when you hear that concept, you say, that's my life.

01:25:38.614 --> 01:25:42.039
That's what I want to live.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.647
And this is the way I want to be treated, and this is the way I want to treat others.

01:25:48.068 --> 01:25:48.208
Mm-hmm.

01:25:48.357 --> 01:26:12.087
so um and it's you know it's difficult uh i think like i said earlier i think we really are here only to i mean i'm a disciple of course of miracles i don't know you ever heard of it anyway it's um it's one of my spiritual teachings now and it really is just a question of

01:26:12.421 --> 01:26:17.106
If all we're here to do is to love and to forgive, you know, it's very difficult to forgive.

01:26:18.567 --> 01:26:20.369
You hold on to it.

01:26:20.389 --> 01:26:26.396
And, you know, you learn that forgiveness isn't about the other person.

01:26:26.976 --> 01:26:28.878
It's about yourself.

01:26:29.699 --> 01:26:33.423
Because who you resent lives in your mind.

01:26:33.923 --> 01:26:35.265
It doesn't live in the other person.

01:26:35.986 --> 01:26:39.289
The resentment you carry it has nothing to do with it.

01:26:39.657 --> 01:26:41.418
you internalize it, you hold it.

01:26:41.799 --> 01:26:43.460
They hold a space in your mind.

01:26:44.341 --> 01:26:48.945
So what I've learned to do is that when I feel resentment towards somebody, I pray for them.

01:26:49.986 --> 01:26:56.892
And all of a sudden, it doesn't happen overnight, but in time, I don't feel that resentment anymore.

01:26:58.093 --> 01:26:59.754
But we all have to do our own work.

01:27:00.294 --> 01:27:01.736
No one can do it for you.

01:27:01.756 --> 01:27:09.242
So if anything, I've learned that, that you have to take care of yourself.

01:27:09.965 --> 01:27:14.630
They say you have to put the oxygen mask on yourself before you can help anybody else.

01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:23.939
And for the longest time, growing up in an alcoholic home, I always thought, I was always afraid the shoe would always drop.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:36.071
You know, things were going well, something terrible is going to happen, or your self-esteem is so low, your self-worth is so low, because you're always living in fear.

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.233
Fear has this dominant...

01:27:38.905 --> 01:28:08.322
stranglehold on you and that's the disease of alcoholism that's the disease of addiction so it's i didn't go to l and i to help whoever i went i ended up helping myself and that's what i learned i had to take care of myself first if i could take care of anybody else and i have to work on myself i can't i can't they say i i didn't cause it i can't control it i can't cure it

01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:10.332
And that's about everybody.

01:28:10.633 --> 01:28:11.554
Yeah.

01:28:11.574 --> 01:28:11.795
Yeah.

01:28:13.177 --> 01:28:35.389
Um, since we were kind of talking about spirituality, uh, another thing I was curious about is whether you, um, like, and, and this also goes to that question about just kind of like messy side being this, this kind of general thing in the air of, um,

01:28:35.707 --> 01:28:48.479
the Chicano or the Mexican American community is like its connection or representation in the Virgen de Guadalupe.

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:53.783
And I was just curious if you, like, how do you understand her?

01:28:53.803 --> 01:28:58.107
Do you see her as a mestizo or as an Indian?

01:28:59.969 --> 01:29:04.313
You know, it's interesting because I have a,

01:29:05.069 --> 01:29:14.762
We have Michael Males, I call him, we meet every Saturday morning and we share our little spiritual, you know, daily readings and stuff.

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:18.067
But they're all followers.

01:29:18.187 --> 01:29:19.409
We're all followers of the weekend.

01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:26.318
And I'm not so... There are some that, you know...

01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:31.344
Your belief in a power greater than itself applies to anything.

01:29:31.785 --> 01:29:33.607
It could be the region of Guadalupe.

01:29:33.707 --> 01:29:34.568
It could be Christ.

01:29:34.648 --> 01:29:35.969
It could be God.

01:29:36.029 --> 01:29:37.130
It could be a plant.

01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:38.331
It could be whatever it is.

01:29:38.371 --> 01:29:39.593
Social justice.

01:29:40.153 --> 01:29:41.695
Anything greater than yourself.

01:29:42.556 --> 01:29:47.681
So where you place that belief is where it is the strongest.

01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:54.988
And for me, I don't believe in a gender in God.

01:29:55.407 --> 01:29:59.611
It's not a white male, and it's God is just spirit.

01:30:00.351 --> 01:30:02.233
The vegan is just spirit.

01:30:02.253 --> 01:30:04.815
These are just mortal shells that we carry.

01:30:05.556 --> 01:30:10.380
You know, who we are is not what you see here in the outside.

01:30:10.981 --> 01:30:13.944
It's what's inside, and we're all the same inside.

01:30:13.984 --> 01:30:18.788
What we do, what we feed our spirit, that's who we are.

01:30:19.328 --> 01:30:24.553
If we feed anger and resentment, it's reflected.

01:30:24.787 --> 01:30:54.287
in us so for the Virgin of Guadalupe she's an icon like Buddha like Jesus that has for me an equal part as everyone else it's not something that I hold higher even though I have images that's an old painting from a great friend but

01:30:54.453 --> 01:31:02.823
And so, yeah, so she holds a place on that altar like all people.

01:31:03.484 --> 01:31:03.944
Yeah.

01:31:04.865 --> 01:31:19.542
But I think, I mean, there's something to be said of how you experience her, right, as an equal to these other kind of spiritual figures or what have you.

01:31:19.823 --> 01:31:23.827
And then there's something to be said of the image.

01:31:24.168 --> 01:31:24.308
Mm-hmm.

01:31:24.490 --> 01:31:37.183
and how she is portrayed in art or the story, or even in your guys' play, The Vidhin and the Tipayak.

01:31:38.084 --> 01:31:53.299
So I was just curious if being familiar with The Vidhin was something that maybe prepared you

01:31:53.836 --> 01:32:11.940
for when you were introduced or understood what Mestizaje was later in your 20s, do you see a connection between staring at that image and then learning about something like Mestizaje and then eventually like these things as well?

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:18.389
You know, it's interesting because growing up, we didn't have the Vita de Guadalupe in our house.

01:32:18.409 --> 01:32:22.915
Not like she is present in a lot of homes, especially in America.

01:32:23.603 --> 01:32:26.146
We grew up with El Santo Nino de Atoche.

01:32:26.986 --> 01:32:28.688
This is my mom's.

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:31.191
The Santo Nino is from Zacatecas.

01:32:32.132 --> 01:32:41.261
And it's actually, the Santo Nino is a child, Christ, that went into the prison.

01:32:43.062 --> 01:32:47.987
Anyway, we grew up in our home with Santo Nino.

01:32:48.067 --> 01:32:50.590
So I didn't find one with Santo Nino.

01:32:50.873 --> 01:32:56.742
The Virgin was something that was introduced to me later in life.

01:32:57.563 --> 01:33:09.260
It was actually, it was not in my, it wasn't, the saints that we had in church in Cutler were not the Virgin of Guadalupe.

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:18.113
If she was, she was delegated somewhere, you know, but there was images, the statues that I can remember seeing of,

01:33:19.595 --> 01:33:23.462
Lady of Fatima

01:33:23.965 --> 01:33:24.866
Other images.

01:33:24.886 --> 01:33:25.887
The Virgin Mary.

01:33:26.287 --> 01:33:26.748
But it wasn't.

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:33.273
Do you think, like, did you see that change since maybe like the UFW march?

01:33:33.313 --> 01:33:35.676
Because they're holding her banner.

01:33:35.716 --> 01:33:38.918
They're leading the march with her banner, right?

01:33:38.938 --> 01:33:40.220
I'm talking about my childhood.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.421
Right, right, right, right.

01:33:41.441 --> 01:33:47.006
And when I was introduced to the Vigen, I was really here with the Teatro.

01:33:47.026 --> 01:33:53.972
And it wasn't until then that I, you know, that she's become like a symbol for a lot of Mexicanos.

01:33:53.952 --> 01:34:06.437
And I can understand that, but growing up, there was no strong... Your grandma never really... No, my grandma, I don't think she was.

01:34:06.457 --> 01:34:14.153
But my mom did say... My mom said that Grandma Bisabuela was a Guadalupano.

01:34:14.173 --> 01:34:14.273
Yeah.

01:34:14.523 --> 01:34:23.163
They were Guadalupe in Cutler, but it was more like a social club.

01:34:23.845 --> 01:34:28.014
They have tarliadas on the weekends and, you know, they're so... Jameicas.

01:34:28.255 --> 01:34:29.337
Jameicas.

01:34:29.357 --> 01:34:33.527
But, you know, as far as being...

01:34:33.507 --> 01:34:41.737
You know, now I think that Virgen has been placed in center stage, whereas before she was just the mother of Christ.

01:34:42.198 --> 01:34:45.482
So Christ was always the dominant figure.

01:34:46.463 --> 01:34:50.488
And like I said, they're all equal to me now.

01:34:51.048 --> 01:35:02.342
There's no one that this is above or superior or identify solely on her, identify her as an equal partner.

01:35:03.003 --> 01:35:03.143
Mm-hmm.

01:35:03.865 --> 01:35:06.929
you know, as we should all be equal partners in life.

01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.770
Yeah.

01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:14.640
You know, not one more than the other, not, I think we contain both feminine and masculine in us.

01:35:15.661 --> 01:35:28.219
I don't think inside of me, it says that I'm solely just a woman, but I'm also a man, you know, I, the, the idea that somehow, um,

01:35:29.633 --> 01:35:46.647
I want to feel that we're equal in both sense, so that I can't dislike the male side in me, or the feminine side in me, in the same way that Davidian and Christ and all the other figures are one and the same.

01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:49.990
Yeah, that's good.

01:35:50.771 --> 01:35:55.595
I'm pretty much done with my question.

01:35:56.796 --> 01:35:59.218
Is there anything else you want to add?

01:36:00.025 --> 01:36:01.327
Leave for posterity?

01:36:03.009 --> 01:36:03.890
What do I leave?

01:36:04.530 --> 01:36:11.078
No, you know, what do I want?

01:36:11.519 --> 01:36:13.702
You know, life is ever-changing.

01:36:14.362 --> 01:36:20.250
And that I think we're here on a river just flowing through.

01:36:21.151 --> 01:36:25.536
And sometimes we can go into heavy currents.

01:36:26.197 --> 01:36:28.800
But learning just to maintain a balance in life.

01:36:29.084 --> 01:36:31.689
I think it's important, important for me anyway.

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:43.494
My greatest is to really treat others as the way I want to be treated.

01:36:43.514 --> 01:36:46.721
I truly believe that that's the true message for all of us.

01:36:48.424 --> 01:36:50.148
That's about it.

01:36:50.168 --> 01:36:51.591
All right.

01:36:51.611 --> 01:36:52.974
All right.

01:36:52.994 --> 01:36:53.114
Good.

01:36:53.134 --> 01:36:54.417
Thank you very much.
