WEBVTT

00:00.942 --> 00:02.544
Okay, testing.

00:04.266 --> 00:08.310
So we are, today is September 13th, we said?

00:08.650 --> 00:08.911
Yes.

00:09.411 --> 00:11.574
Lucky Friday the 13th?

00:11.654 --> 00:12.855
Yes, lucky Friday.

00:14.397 --> 00:21.485
And we are here with Lupe Estrias, right?

00:21.645 --> 00:23.947
Or if I want a Lupe.

00:23.967 --> 00:28.933
In my formal thing, I say, but I guess fine.

00:28.993 --> 00:29.093
Okay.

00:29.461 --> 00:31.403
I think, let me see.

00:31.943 --> 00:33.225
Yeah, let me see.

00:33.305 --> 00:35.067
Try and say something.

00:35.127 --> 00:37.229
Testing, testing, one, two, three.

00:37.249 --> 00:37.809
Oh, there we go.

00:38.650 --> 00:39.751
Is that okay?

00:39.771 --> 00:41.133
Yeah, I think that'll be fine.

00:41.213 --> 00:44.055
Just make sure maybe you kind of speak a little.

00:44.075 --> 00:44.296
Project.

00:45.096 --> 00:46.478
A little louder, yeah.

00:48.039 --> 00:53.084
So I'm just going to start with basic, you know, your name, your age.

00:55.006 --> 00:56.768
If you could tell me your name and age.

00:58.452 --> 01:03.318
My name is Guadalupe Frias, and I'm 65 years old.

01:07.263 --> 01:14.551
And then, can you tell us where you were born or where you were raised, where you grew up?

01:14.571 --> 01:15.533
You want my life story?

01:15.893 --> 01:19.457
Yeah, okay.

01:20.198 --> 01:23.482
Okay, so I was born in Edinburgh, Texas.

01:23.782 --> 01:28.408
My parents were very young, and...

01:30.548 --> 01:33.031
I was actually birthed by a midwife.

01:35.714 --> 01:37.877
I have four siblings.

01:38.077 --> 01:47.969
I have an older brother and two younger brothers and my sister, who's 11 years younger than I. My parents were immigrants.

01:49.511 --> 01:55.999
My dad was working as a bracero in the early 50s.

01:56.806 --> 02:09.938
he would go by himself contract himself out with some of his buddies and go to like Illinois or the Midwest to do irrigation or things like that.

02:10.618 --> 02:12.300
So he wasn't actually there when I was born.

02:13.141 --> 02:16.263
Um, but you know, he came shortly after.

02:16.884 --> 02:19.967
So we were there for a while for about two years in Texas.

02:20.247 --> 02:24.771
And then from there, uh, everybody was seemed to be going to California.

02:25.105 --> 02:32.238
And so my dad knew a woman who wanted to come to California.

02:32.258 --> 02:33.741
Of course, my dad did not have a car.

02:34.703 --> 02:36.706
So she wanted to come to California.

02:36.746 --> 02:38.550
She had a car, and she just needed a driver.

02:39.151 --> 02:42.657
So she said, ¿por qué no nos vamos para Tejas?

02:42.697 --> 02:43.799
And my dad didn't want to.

02:44.260 --> 02:47.586
But my mom was always more...

02:48.848 --> 03:11.582
she was less risk averse let's say than my dad and she said see mama everybody's going over there you know and let's go you know so i guess we all piled up piled in a car and we um we came to california and i don't know exactly how they ended up in lindsay california but they had been farm laborers so

03:13.385 --> 03:22.678
I guess that was, they met somebody in their travels who was from Lindsay, and they said, well, Lindsay's a good place because you can have a base there.

03:22.778 --> 03:32.111
Ahí está la aceituna in the fall, and then in the spring you have the oranges, then you have the navel and the valencia, and then you have the tomato.

03:32.692 --> 03:37.719
And then after that, well, you can go to Fresno to the grapes, or you can migrate farther.

03:37.860 --> 03:38.160
So...

03:38.647 --> 03:39.408
That's what we did.

03:39.428 --> 03:44.814
We established a home in Tonyville, which is in the outskirts of Lindsay.

03:45.155 --> 03:46.256
Tonyville?

03:46.276 --> 03:46.517
Tonyville.

03:46.757 --> 03:49.100
T-O-N-Y-V-I-L-E.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.401
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:51.082 --> 03:55.067
In La Barrio, everybody thought of it as being rough.

03:56.228 --> 04:00.133
And people were like, you're from Tonyville, ooh, you know.

04:00.153 --> 04:03.117
So it's kind of like a neighborhood in Lindsay?

04:03.237 --> 04:07.342
Yeah, it's an unincorporated area of Lindsay.

04:08.303 --> 04:08.383
Hmm.

04:09.005 --> 04:11.007
So I went to school there.

04:15.251 --> 04:18.234
So that's like around 1956?

04:20.457 --> 04:23.640
Well, my youngest brother was the only one that was born in California.

04:23.720 --> 04:24.901
So that was in 57.

04:24.921 --> 04:26.663
Oh, okay, 57.

04:28.185 --> 04:35.712
So by 57, we were living in this little shack, little shack in Tonyville.

04:35.732 --> 04:38.235
And my grandmother, my dad's mother, was with us.

04:38.738 --> 04:51.478
her and her daughter, who was about, my aunt, who was about five years older than I. And we were there working, they were there working and, you know, we were like dirt poor.

04:52.379 --> 05:05.860
But in that period, there was no, we were not, my parents were not about getting, we didn't know about any food stamps or, you know, any kind of aid.

05:06.363 --> 05:08.886
And plus my parents were very much not about that.

05:10.527 --> 05:19.056
So eventually, so that house burned down because I guess it had a really low roof and I guess they were cooking.

05:19.096 --> 05:20.217
And anyway, it was a big fire.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.919
I don't really remember it.

05:22.619 --> 05:26.343
But from there, my mom was a big saver.

05:26.363 --> 05:29.626
She was really thrifty and she just knew how to save.

05:30.467 --> 05:33.130
And so she saved money and we bought

05:34.088 --> 05:40.177
I think it was like an old apartment building because it was brought on a semi.

05:40.898 --> 05:48.248
So they bought a lot on another street and they brought that structure to the property.

05:48.268 --> 05:54.137
And then my dad just kind of fixed it up, added a porch and stuff like that.

05:54.798 --> 05:55.879
And so that became our home.

05:55.939 --> 06:02.188
And we were probably one of the first, I don't know, I mean, but we became homeowners.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.311
And then my grandma was a big lot.

06:04.331 --> 06:09.700
So my grandma lived in the back and we bought a little trailer for her to start out with.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.604
And eventually my dad built a little house for her.

06:12.624 --> 06:13.365
Interesting.

06:13.385 --> 06:21.338
So they bought a piece of land and then towed in some kind of like house, put another house there.

06:21.719 --> 06:24.984
That's interesting.

06:26.887 --> 06:26.927
So

06:27.430 --> 06:31.755
And that was your dad's mother and sister?

06:32.295 --> 06:32.435
Mm-hmm.

06:32.455 --> 06:32.976
Oh, okay.

06:32.996 --> 06:34.317
That lived with you guys there.

06:35.118 --> 06:35.458
Okay.

06:36.880 --> 06:37.461
Interesting.

06:37.741 --> 06:41.245
I didn't know you were from Texas or born in Texas.

06:41.265 --> 06:47.892
Well, if I had grown up there, I would consider myself a Tejana, which I think is really cool culture.

06:47.912 --> 06:51.215
But I don't identify as a Tejana because I wasn't raised there.

06:52.697 --> 06:52.877
Uh-huh.

06:52.897 --> 06:52.997
Yeah.

06:53.017 --> 06:53.117
Yeah.

06:53.722 --> 07:22.750
okay so let me ask you about your participation or involvement with the Chicano movement and I know that you and I have kind of talked about you know you consider yourself like on the trail end but but how would you characterize or how would you yeah how would you characterize your involvement or support for the Chicano movement well

07:23.168 --> 07:46.973
So in my high, in my town, Lindsay, I would say at that time, there were, there were the, the, the farmers, the land, the farmers, then there were like the management farmers, the small retail, a small retail sector, and then agricultural workers.

07:47.554 --> 07:50.057
So Mexicans were agricultural workers.

07:50.077 --> 07:52.399
Some of the farmers were Japanese.

07:52.818 --> 08:00.795
and white, but the Japanese were mostly doing tomatoes and the whites were doing the oranges.

08:00.815 --> 08:12.160
And my dad joined the farm workers movement when Cesar came to Porterville and he was a very ardent supporter.

08:12.680 --> 08:19.967
And I remember going to, he became like a, I don't know what he was exactly, but he would like sign people up.

08:19.987 --> 08:21.328
And so he would take me with him.

08:21.609 --> 08:25.512
I was his secre.

08:25.773 --> 08:33.420
And so I would take the money and write down the, I must've been like 12, you know, I wasn't that, I wasn't that old.

08:33.840 --> 08:34.982
What was your dad's name?

08:35.282 --> 08:35.802
Jesus.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.044
Jesus Frias.

08:38.565 --> 08:39.826
Yeah.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.708
And so,

08:42.447 --> 08:51.275
So I knew, so I was, you know, so my dad had this angst against, you know, and he always talked about whites as the other.

08:51.956 --> 08:53.477
And of course, blacks as the other too.

08:54.218 --> 08:55.960
Or anybody who wasn't Mexican as the other.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.644
But the hueros, my mom would refer to them as los americanos.

09:01.245 --> 09:02.126
She was always very polite.

09:02.306 --> 09:08.171
My dad was typical mexicano, you know, cussing and everything.

09:08.191 --> 09:09.012
But...

09:09.970 --> 09:33.119
And then I was very, I mean, I think I was very aware of being brown and being different, you know, and it was, I think as a group, we carried a lot of, I would say, internalized racism and probably, you know, all the other ones, all the isms.

09:33.920 --> 09:39.066
But, so I was aware that the,

09:40.143 --> 09:42.185
of the classes and race divisions.

09:42.205 --> 09:50.153
So at that time, that was 1970, I was in high school from, I guess, 68 to 72, more or less.

09:51.154 --> 10:01.284
And the whole school was run by whites, like the pep team and all the leadership positions, the class president, all that, they were all white.

10:01.724 --> 10:03.026
What was that high school?

10:03.426 --> 10:04.087
Porterville?

10:04.147 --> 10:04.787
Lindsay High School.

10:04.967 --> 10:08.631
Oh, Lindsay High School.

10:09.488 --> 10:15.096
So I was very aware of those divisions and I think resentful.

10:15.316 --> 10:24.510
But also I didn't, socially, you know, like I was one of the few people in the, few Chicanas in the college prep class.

10:24.930 --> 10:27.134
I think there was three of us in my humanities class.

10:27.754 --> 10:31.320
And then slowly, I don't know how, but eventually it was like the only one.

10:31.880 --> 10:38.550
And then in math also, and when I got to, I think it was, I was going to go into calculus.

10:38.952 --> 10:39.893
Or pre-calculus.

10:40.454 --> 10:43.037
And all my friends were like, what are you taking that for?

10:43.077 --> 10:44.098
You don't need that.

10:44.179 --> 10:46.141
You know, come on, just drop it.

10:48.504 --> 10:54.271
And then I got to college and I was flunked at, you know, calculus and all that.

10:54.792 --> 10:56.354
Because one year really made a difference.

10:56.374 --> 10:58.436
But I had been an A student in everything.

10:59.297 --> 11:01.861
The only thing I could never get into was chemistry and physics.

11:01.981 --> 11:04.984
Like, I'd get in there and every single person was white.

11:05.785 --> 11:07.087
And the language was foreign.

11:07.287 --> 11:07.828
And I just,

11:08.348 --> 11:08.728
I don't know.

11:08.748 --> 11:09.489
I just couldn't do it.

11:09.509 --> 11:14.694
I think I signed up for chemistry twice and got through the elements and it was like, I can't do this, you know?

11:16.036 --> 11:25.285
Sadly, but anyway, um, so I was very aware and, but I, I, and you know, of course in high school, you're very like clicky, right?

11:25.906 --> 11:35.335
And so the day that, so one time we were going to play, they were, I had a teacher, Mr. Polito, who was Italian and he was gay, but he wasn't out.

11:35.355 --> 11:38.338
And I didn't, I don't think I even knew he was gay, but, um,

11:39.263 --> 11:44.789
He was the first person who expressed a hope for me.

11:45.329 --> 11:48.192
Like, oh, you're going to be a teacher, you know?

11:48.253 --> 11:49.474
And I was like, a teacher?

11:49.534 --> 11:51.656
I was like, I couldn't even imagine.

11:51.676 --> 11:54.799
I mean, think of it now, and I was just like, that's so weird.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.182
But I could not imagine myself being a teacher.

11:57.202 --> 11:59.965
I just thought that was out of this world, you know?

12:00.566 --> 12:01.126
I didn't know any.

12:01.146 --> 12:06.692
I mean, we had Mr. Guerrero, who was Mexican, but I couldn't stand him.

12:06.752 --> 12:08.494
He was just so obnoxious.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.785
I didn't really see him as a role model.

12:12.805 --> 12:16.330
I think I saw him as like a... I don't know.

12:17.713 --> 12:21.218
But anyway, he was never like encouraging or mentoring or nothing.

12:21.278 --> 12:24.764
He just was like doing his job teaching Spanish.

12:25.425 --> 12:35.521
But Mr. Ippolito was, you know, and one time we were going to... We were going to go... So we had been reading Shakespeare and he wanted to take us to Fresno to see a play.

12:35.541 --> 12:36.422
I think it was...

12:37.465 --> 12:51.949
I don't remember which, maybe it was Romeo and Juliet, one of those, and I wanted to go, or maybe it was something with Queen Elizabeth, I don't know which one it was, but I wanted to go, but none of my friends, of course, none of my friends were in my class, so I didn't want to go by myself.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.452
Right.

12:53.532 --> 12:58.721
So, I think I mentioned it to Mr. Pooley, he said, so loopy, are you coming with us, or something?

12:58.901 --> 12:59.001
Yeah.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.645
And I said, I said, no.

13:02.665 --> 13:05.511
And so some of the little white girls said, why not?

13:06.032 --> 13:08.096
And I said, oh, I don't want to go by myself.

13:09.018 --> 13:10.281
I said, none of my friends are going.

13:10.321 --> 13:15.572
And they said, where are your friends?

13:15.923 --> 13:21.309
I was like, oh, I don't think so.

13:21.629 --> 13:22.591
I mean, I don't know what I said.

13:22.891 --> 13:27.236
But I used to have these fantasies of playing the role of, I think it was some character.

13:27.256 --> 13:28.758
I can't remember what character it was.

13:28.818 --> 13:29.639
It was some character.

13:30.840 --> 13:38.849
And I remember I had fantasies of, like, dressing up as her and, like, because I think he, anyway, he wanted us to do a project.

13:38.909 --> 13:42.353
Anyway, so socially, I just couldn't.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.317
I didn't feel comfortable with white people.

13:46.119 --> 13:49.443
It was awkward, especially like the middle class ones.

13:49.844 --> 13:52.748
The working class ones, I think I was more relaxed around them.

13:55.712 --> 13:58.576
So I did have that awareness early on.

13:59.097 --> 14:06.147
And of course my dad, with his Cesar Chavez thing and the growers, it's like,

14:06.532 --> 14:12.219
It was just, and the shame, the shame of being a farm worker.

14:12.239 --> 14:15.764
It was like, I think of it now and I think, God, I mean, what was the shame?

14:15.784 --> 14:17.706
I mean, we should have been proud of it, right?

14:17.726 --> 14:18.227
Yeah.

14:18.247 --> 14:19.268
I'm a two-year-old asshole.

14:19.288 --> 14:22.793
I'll probably cry a little bit.

14:22.813 --> 14:23.414
But.

14:23.434 --> 14:34.347
It's difficult to think about, like, that shame.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.210
Yeah.

14:36.230 --> 14:36.370
Mm-hmm.

14:37.801 --> 14:42.787
So we would come out of the fields, you know, um, with that white powder.

14:44.168 --> 14:47.492
I mean, if I just pause it, if I just try a little bit, then I can talk.

14:54.780 --> 14:55.100
Okay.

14:55.140 --> 14:55.521
Sorry.

14:57.062 --> 14:57.483
Okay.

14:57.803 --> 14:59.145
Yeah, it should be fine.

15:01.387 --> 15:01.567
Okay.

15:01.587 --> 15:03.049
So I was saying that, um,

15:04.160 --> 15:08.185
When we would come out, we were all ashamed of being farm workers.

15:08.225 --> 15:12.731
And I say all of us because I was dating this one guy from Porterville.

15:13.132 --> 15:24.867
And one time we were in a field and actually his, anyway, so we were in a field and we saw, I saw a couple of his friends and I was like, oh my God, I was mortified.

15:24.907 --> 15:29.153
It was like, oh my God, I had to go hide behind a tree and stuff.

15:29.173 --> 15:29.273
Yeah.

15:32.476 --> 15:39.608
But in general, it's like we would come out of the fields with this powder on us and then, you know, dusting everything.

15:39.628 --> 15:43.755
And sometimes, of course, because we lived in three miles out of Lindsay.

15:45.037 --> 15:46.099
So we'd always on the way home.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.884
Oh, whatever.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.046
So we'd stop at the store.

15:50.296 --> 15:52.519
And then my dad, nobody wanted, everybody would hide.

15:52.559 --> 15:56.465
All my brothers, we'd all hide, like slumped down.

15:56.485 --> 15:58.468
Because Lizzie, you know, everybody knows everybody, you know.

15:58.949 --> 16:01.493
So, and then he'd say, pues, ¿quién va conmigo?

16:01.513 --> 16:03.396
And nobody wanted to go, no, pues, ¿cómo?

16:03.756 --> 16:04.778
¿Cómo van a entrar?

16:05.098 --> 16:07.101
You know, like he would kind of mock us a little bit.

16:08.263 --> 16:12.109
So, so that was embarrassing.

16:12.129 --> 16:16.135
And then one time I remember we picked in Exeter and we had, it was by a foster freeze.

16:16.807 --> 16:24.257
and I think it was in the summertime, and there we were right by the foster freeze, you know, with the ladders and our sacks and everything.

16:24.277 --> 16:25.199
It was just like, oh.

16:25.880 --> 16:30.506
I mean, I think part of it was just being in high school, you know, you're embarrassed of everything, you know, but even more so.

16:32.168 --> 16:43.564
But just a couple, I mean, I remember one time we were picking, and I think it was actually in, I think it was in Oregon.

16:43.584 --> 16:44.505
I'm not sure where it was.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.126
Maybe it was here.

16:45.713 --> 16:53.421
But my dad, we were picking raspberries, and it was either the contractor or the owner.

16:54.222 --> 16:54.743
He walked by.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.206
He said something to my dad, which was really demeaning.

16:58.547 --> 17:05.595
I don't remember what he said, but I just remember feeling just really angry because my dad didn't say anything.

17:05.635 --> 17:07.056
He didn't respond back.

17:10.120 --> 17:15.045
So just seeing your father being humiliated like that.

17:15.683 --> 17:19.147
Um, so it created a lot of angst in me.

17:19.627 --> 17:20.689
So back to high school.

17:20.709 --> 17:21.029
Sorry.

17:21.389 --> 17:25.214
Um, I did try and I, cause I wanted to be a cheer.

17:25.274 --> 17:26.355
I wanted to be a cheerleader.

17:30.059 --> 17:31.641
I really wanted to be a cheerleader.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.745
And, uh, I remember I would practice with a, with a paddle.

17:37.847 --> 17:42.613
I would flip it and you know, do like baton twirling and everything.

17:42.653 --> 17:44.695
Um, and

17:45.046 --> 17:55.376
And so I tried out for being a, because there was only one Mexican that was allowed to be, well, that was a cheerleader, Doreen Manriquez.

17:55.396 --> 17:58.979
And she lived in town, and she was kind of, I guess her parents were pretty stable, you know.

18:00.901 --> 18:03.823
So she was the only one, and she was in the class ahead of me.

18:04.444 --> 18:07.146
So I tried out for the next year, and then I didn't get it.

18:08.127 --> 18:09.849
And I knew I probably wouldn't get it.

18:09.889 --> 18:13.112
But even just to go practice, you know, we had to go to some of these girls' houses.

18:13.717 --> 18:40.433
and that was just a little awkward um but um so then i tried so then today i didn't get that so then i tried out for letter girl so then i so then i got letter girl and i figured it's probably because it was a consolation prize so there were more mexicans as letter girls but not that many even and the letter girl like the ones that they hold up the letters of the l l l i n oh so i was the l

18:44.294 --> 18:45.996
So that was funny.

18:46.016 --> 18:46.436
Yeah.

18:46.957 --> 18:50.301
So how did all that, those experiences?

18:50.321 --> 18:52.283
So I think it just created a lot.

18:52.323 --> 18:53.164
I was really angry.

18:55.086 --> 18:56.148
I was really angry.

18:56.828 --> 19:00.192
Um, I was, I just was angry.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.414
It was just angry.

19:02.395 --> 19:14.048
Um, and so when I got to college, um, um, so I was at Merrill college at UCSC and

19:15.209 --> 19:23.519
they had a Spanish-speaking floor, because they had a, what was his name?

19:24.721 --> 19:29.106
The historian, David Sweet.

19:30.307 --> 19:33.031
And he spoke, he was married to a Mexicana.

19:34.212 --> 19:37.216
He had two kids, and he was the, what do they call him?

19:37.816 --> 19:43.343
Not resident assistant, he was the proctor or something, the proctor for that college.

19:43.998 --> 19:44.699
Not the doctor.

19:44.720 --> 19:44.980
Anyway.

19:45.321 --> 19:47.225
Or like the provost or dean.

19:47.245 --> 19:48.487
It wasn't the provost.

19:48.507 --> 19:49.469
He lived there.

19:50.451 --> 19:53.638
So anyway, his family lived there.

19:53.678 --> 19:55.021
He has his wife and his two kids.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.223
So he spoke perfect Spanish.

19:56.243 --> 19:58.909
His wife was from Mexico.

19:59.510 --> 20:04.200
So he was like the closest thing we had to a Mexican presence in leadership.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.764
So they had established a Spanish-speaking floor.

20:08.905 --> 20:14.472
And it was just for people who were interested in speaking Spanish, but of course, all the Chicanos went there, stayed there.

20:14.492 --> 20:17.957
So on one side was all the girls, the females, and on the other side was the guys.

20:18.798 --> 20:28.510
So just being together, and actually, even though with the Spanish-speaking floor, there was only three of us, Gloria, Madeline, and myself, who were the Latinas.

20:29.732 --> 20:33.276
And this was the largest...

20:34.285 --> 20:36.188
entering class in 1976.

20:36.208 --> 20:36.989
No, yeah, 1976.

20:37.390 --> 20:39.233
No, 1973.

20:39.634 --> 20:42.058
1972.

20:42.979 --> 20:45.763
I graduated in 72.

20:46.405 --> 20:47.086
Yeah.

20:47.106 --> 20:48.448
So it was the fall of 72.

20:48.468 --> 20:52.574
It was the largest entering class that UCSC had ever admitted.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.117
And I think there were 30 of us.

20:54.538 --> 20:56.060
Of Chicanos and Latinos.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.262
Of Latinos, yeah, 30.

20:57.643 --> 20:58.324
30 of us.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.225
I believe it was 30 of us.

20:59.325 --> 20:59.886
Wow.

21:00.828 --> 21:01.609
And...

21:02.652 --> 21:04.695
And they probably have not improved.

21:04.755 --> 21:05.997
It's probably gotten worse now.

21:08.780 --> 21:20.096
So, of course, Madeline, who was from Porterville, I never met her until there, but Porterville was like 10 miles away from us.

21:20.116 --> 21:28.167
But she had an uncle who was an attorney, or he was more ahead of her.

21:28.207 --> 21:31.191
So she had gone, I think he had taken her to the

21:31.913 --> 21:34.776
some rallies or marches in LA.

21:35.296 --> 21:37.238
So she was a little bit more political than I was.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.742
But I don't know.

21:40.762 --> 21:42.263
So they said, oh, there's a mecha meeting.

21:42.784 --> 21:44.305
Let's go to our first mecha.

21:44.325 --> 21:45.987
So then we go to our first mecha meeting.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.670
And of course, the guys were all in charge.

21:49.651 --> 21:51.953
And I was very, very shy.

21:52.253 --> 21:53.955
I mean, I was super, super shy.

21:54.095 --> 22:01.903
I never talked, if you can believe this, I never talked through elementary school, ever, unless I was called upon.

22:02.542 --> 22:27.958
um I was usually not called because they knew I'd be mortified um so I just I was very like I couldn't talk in public if I tried to talk in public my heart would start beating my hands would start sweating and then whatever came out was like I don't even know what I was saying I couldn't I think it was awful it was horrible um but um so at this meta meeting you know I couldn't talk there either so

22:28.732 --> 22:31.436
But the older classmen, like the guys are ahead of us.

22:31.456 --> 22:38.787
So I remember Rudy Escovedo and Andres Jimenez, and they were like the upperclassmen.

22:38.867 --> 22:42.713
They were like, I don't know, I think maybe they're two years ahead or maybe one year ahead of me.

22:43.354 --> 22:44.275
And they were both from LA.

22:44.455 --> 22:47.500
And then one of them, Bill Chavez, he was from Visalia, which is,

22:47.885 --> 22:48.966
in the San Joaquin Valley.

22:48.986 --> 22:49.227
Right.

22:50.007 --> 22:52.851
And, um, so he talked.

22:53.632 --> 22:56.355
So only mostly, I think I only remember the guys talking.

22:57.276 --> 23:08.469
Um, it was, I was just kind of, I remember that meeting because it was, I, it was the first time I had ever been in a meeting like that, you know?

23:08.489 --> 23:13.134
So I just, you know, I was, of course I was going to be a mental member, you know?

23:14.215 --> 23:15.597
Um, and then

23:15.965 --> 23:22.235
Uh, we just, as a group, we had, we were socially, we hung out together.

23:22.395 --> 23:25.020
We, you know, had lunch together.

23:25.681 --> 23:27.383
Sometimes we take the same classes.

23:28.465 --> 23:33.433
Um, and so we, so we, we were, we were always like doing something.

23:34.294 --> 23:42.107
Um, but in addition to that, uh, we had a friend, uh, Juan Rios, he was from Madera.

23:42.577 --> 23:45.982
And he had been in a Mexican folklore dance group.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.666
And he said, well, let's start a dance group, you know.

23:49.507 --> 23:51.129
And we're like, yeah, let's start a dance group.

23:51.570 --> 23:52.171
So we did.

23:52.251 --> 23:56.037
It was him and Leticia Quesada, who was a little bit over in your head.

23:56.077 --> 23:57.258
She was my roommate.

23:57.979 --> 24:02.786
So I would say the two of them were the primary instigators.

24:02.807 --> 24:05.551
But the first group, I was part of that first group.

24:06.392 --> 24:10.558
And so we called ourselves Los Mexicas.

24:11.259 --> 24:12.060
And we're in the

24:12.766 --> 24:37.103
god it's probably 40 years now and they're still going strong but now they have back then we had to make our own we had to sew our own costumes we had to persuade somebody to be like the faculty advisor um and we just did pretty much everything by ourselves um and then later we had there was a

24:37.184 --> 24:42.430
a guy who ran the music, well, he was in the music department, but he was interested in mariachi.

24:43.111 --> 24:47.076
So he also became very supportive, a white guy.

24:47.937 --> 24:53.023
So Los Mexicas was, we would dance sometimes in the community.

24:53.123 --> 24:55.626
I remember one time I went to Fresno, my parents came to see me dance.

24:56.727 --> 25:00.131
And then we would have practice.

25:00.952 --> 25:03.495
And I remember one time we were dancing, it was a,

25:03.644 --> 25:06.469
So Santa Cruz has like little colleges.

25:07.190 --> 25:09.253
So we were dancing down below.

25:10.255 --> 25:11.978
And it's really loud.

25:12.098 --> 25:15.784
We'd practice Saturday mornings with our, you know, our taps on our shoes.

25:15.804 --> 25:22.875
You know, I remember when this white guy came and he was all, he was like, could you guys go practice somewhere else or something?

25:23.176 --> 25:27.924
He was like, like, he was upset because we were making so much noise.

25:28.064 --> 25:29.466
And we're like, get out of here.

25:29.902 --> 25:44.857
But I mean, so that was a really, I would say that we were, it was part of reclaiming our roots and part of reclaiming who we were and, you know, being proud of who we were.

25:45.338 --> 25:52.245
And of course, at that time, everybody who was David became David, you know, everybody reclaimed their names, right?

25:52.325 --> 25:55.388
In fact, I had a friend who her name was, what was her name?

25:56.949 --> 25:57.630
Judy.

25:58.285 --> 25:59.927
And it's like, who thus?

26:03.912 --> 26:04.934
It was like, come on.

26:04.954 --> 26:07.077
But, you know, she became who thus, you know.

26:07.117 --> 26:09.179
It was so weird.

26:09.199 --> 26:10.461
But, I mean, everybody was doing it.

26:11.082 --> 26:15.027
The Jews, we had two Jewish women in our floor, and they went to a kibbutz in Israel.

26:15.047 --> 26:18.251
And they came back as Shoshana and something else.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.014
So, I don't know.

26:20.034 --> 26:25.541
I think it was just a time of people reclaiming their identity and being proud of their identity.

26:25.561 --> 26:27.043
And that certainly was true for me.

26:27.226 --> 26:48.087
and for my group and then of course there was the stuff around machismo and so there were a couple of times when all the mujeres went and we had a meeting on the beach and I remember the guys found out about it and they were all butthurt they were like

26:49.855 --> 26:51.777
It's so silly.

26:51.797 --> 26:52.418
That's interesting.

26:52.438 --> 26:58.065
So was Mecha already kind of established by the time you got to UCSC?

26:58.566 --> 27:02.872
Or was it something that was kind of just starting?

27:03.573 --> 27:06.096
As far as I knew, it had already started.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.881
Because Rudy and Des had been there the previous year.

27:10.561 --> 27:13.365
And then I think the first Chicanos got there.

27:14.307 --> 27:32.248
in 69 or something like that but roberto robercaba was there and he was the eop director and katia panas she was um she wasn't mexican but she was was she i can't remember where she was but they were both like our like

27:33.325 --> 27:38.893
advisors or the people there to kind of guide us didn't help that they hated each other.

27:39.574 --> 27:43.860
And they had this ongoing thing of like, he hated her mostly him.

27:43.880 --> 27:48.526
You know, he was just, he just like would bad mouth her all the time.

27:48.646 --> 27:50.910
And I don't know what the deal was, you know?

27:51.911 --> 27:55.476
So it's unfortunate because we cared about both of them.

27:55.496 --> 28:01.324
You know, I was going to ask you, cause my mom had mentioned his name, you know, for this project.

28:01.996 --> 28:26.721
and uh she's like oh you should check out this guy right and um and i looked him up and i couldn't find any info on him and uh and i did an interview with uh luis velez and he also mentioned his name so i just wasn't sure if maybe maybe he passed away no he's still i think uh he's living i think in

28:28.321 --> 28:31.385
I want to say Santa Cruz or Watsonville, somewhere in there.

28:31.405 --> 28:32.386
I have his number on there, too.

28:32.807 --> 28:33.708
Oh, okay.

28:33.848 --> 28:39.015
I've been wanting to see him, too, because he was the one who really recruited me to UCSC.

28:39.155 --> 28:41.438
But, yeah, and him and Luis, I think, are compadres.

28:41.819 --> 28:47.085
Yeah, though, in my interview with Luis, he said that he hasn't talked to him in quite a while.

28:47.105 --> 28:49.429
Yeah, I don't know what happened to Roberto.

28:49.449 --> 28:50.089
Yeah, I don't know.

28:50.169 --> 28:51.792
Maybe there was, like, some kind of following that.

28:51.812 --> 28:58.260
So what happened is that Roberto was, he was the OP director, and he was really intent on, his goal was

28:58.544 --> 29:00.287
nobody was recruiting in the Central Valley.

29:00.808 --> 29:05.556
So people were going to LA, people were going to San Francisco, but nobody, that was like an area that was being neglected.

29:05.576 --> 29:16.795
So Roberto took it upon himself to build connections with programs, like in community programs, like in Visalia and Portugal, and then talking to those people and then helping them get to the high schools and recruiting us.

29:17.476 --> 29:18.357
And he was wonderful.

29:18.437 --> 29:23.546
I mean, he was really helpful and he was just really, really helpful.

29:23.907 --> 29:24.147
And

29:24.751 --> 29:34.462
And he was very validating, but I could never quite believe him because he had this eye that quivered, you know, and he had this big mustache.

29:35.122 --> 29:38.346
And he'd always say, oh, these beautiful chicanas, you know.

29:38.366 --> 29:40.348
And I was like, I don't know.

29:40.428 --> 29:41.609
I was just very skeptical.

29:41.629 --> 29:44.913
If you have met me, in fact, I have a friend who said, I was scared of you when I met you.

29:45.454 --> 29:47.035
And I'm like, why?

29:47.116 --> 29:48.497
He's like, you look so mean.

29:49.186 --> 29:50.607
That you looked mean?

29:50.708 --> 29:52.169
That I looked mean.

29:52.189 --> 29:55.192
Oh, because you were just very guarded from people?

29:55.212 --> 29:55.873
Maybe.

29:56.654 --> 29:57.194
I don't know.

29:57.214 --> 29:58.175
I don't know.

29:58.255 --> 30:00.417
But I had long hair, waist length.

30:00.558 --> 30:02.439
Everybody had long hair back then.

30:02.960 --> 30:09.827
And I had really crowded teeth, you know, and I had these funky glasses, you know, and I had this skeptical.

30:09.867 --> 30:12.410
It was more like, who the fuck are you?

30:12.990 --> 30:17.275
Kind of look, you know, but maybe that's what I have to look like, you know, being from Tonyville or something.

30:17.315 --> 30:17.775
I don't know.

30:20.523 --> 30:22.084
I really don't know.

30:22.705 --> 30:25.167
But that's what she said, and I was like, okay, whatever.

30:26.728 --> 30:31.553
But yeah, Roberto, so whenever he would throw all these praise on us, I was just like, okay.

30:32.754 --> 30:38.339
But he ended up getting into a very nasty fight with his boss.

30:39.119 --> 30:43.663
One of the, I think it was a dean or somebody really up high, the chancellor.

30:43.944 --> 30:45.385
Sorry, he was with the chancellor.

30:46.386 --> 30:50.209
And he was getting his doctorate at Stanford, Roberto was.

30:50.678 --> 30:53.482
him and Juan Garcia, and they were both friends.

30:53.702 --> 31:03.056
And so, I don't know, he got a little too cocky with the chancellor or what, but he said, he called him an old fart.

31:03.076 --> 31:05.460
I think that's what I heard, that he called him an old fart.

31:06.361 --> 31:07.423
So he fired him.

31:08.244 --> 31:10.307
He said he was, he fired him for,

31:11.080 --> 31:13.843
What is it when you lose trust in somebody?

31:13.923 --> 31:15.505
There's a term for it.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.388
Oh, no confidence or something.

31:17.428 --> 31:18.349
Something like that, yeah.

31:19.751 --> 31:21.873
So, of course, we all rallied against him.

31:21.913 --> 31:25.017
We did a sit-in at the chancellor's office.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.723
Even people from San Jose went up there.

31:29.763 --> 31:32.246
And, you know, it was a big thing.

31:32.306 --> 31:36.271
I think we were, like, holed up there for maybe a day, one day and one night.

31:36.291 --> 31:37.392
I don't even remember how long it was.

31:38.113 --> 31:40.716
Anyway, he didn't change his mind, so...

31:40.983 --> 31:42.004
So that was that.

31:42.264 --> 31:44.046
So he got fired and had to leave.

31:45.347 --> 31:59.000
But I mean, I do feel like we were part of a force that was trying to have some input and trying to be visible, increase the visibility and create some kind of change.

32:00.101 --> 32:06.467
And so then when I left, so it was also a time of service learning.

32:06.607 --> 32:09.910
At that time, we called it community service.

32:10.177 --> 32:19.372
And so there was a migrant program to mentor and to teach little migrant kids in Watsonville.

32:19.953 --> 32:22.597
So it was called the Pajaro Learning Program.

32:23.178 --> 32:32.133
So my friend who was leading that, she actually got raped and she just like disappeared.

32:32.153 --> 32:33.515
And I was like, what happened to her?

32:34.897 --> 32:36.640
Nobody knew what happened to her for a long time.

32:37.312 --> 32:39.454
But anyway, so there was nobody else left.

32:39.995 --> 32:41.997
I mean, they said, well, Lupe, you have to do it.

32:42.057 --> 32:42.838
I was like, why me?

32:42.858 --> 32:43.499
I don't want to do it.

32:44.039 --> 32:49.385
So I became the chair or whatever of the Bottle Learning Program.

32:51.067 --> 32:54.771
And then slowly I began to find my voice, you know, very slowly.

32:55.932 --> 33:05.142
Yeah, and then so when it came to graduating, it was like everybody was either pre-law or pre-med or they were going to be teachers.

33:05.273 --> 33:07.496
And I didn't want to do any of those things.

33:07.516 --> 33:10.922
I mean, I thought law was, maybe I thought it was too hard.

33:10.962 --> 33:12.965
I didn't think I could do it.

33:13.005 --> 33:14.747
Pre-med, it was like I didn't have the requirements.

33:15.549 --> 33:19.054
Teaching, I thought, I didn't think teaching was a big deal.

33:19.294 --> 33:21.017
I thought it was not a big deal.

33:21.037 --> 33:23.701
And so then there was this other group of people that were going to grad school.

33:25.384 --> 33:29.610
And the Ford Foundation wanted to establish a pipeline.

33:29.877 --> 33:35.323
And so Andres, my friend Andres, had gotten a Ford Foundation fellowship.

33:35.343 --> 33:37.645
He was at Berkeley now in poli-sci.

33:38.326 --> 33:41.168
My friend Rudy Escobedo was in poli-sci also at Berkeley.

33:41.809 --> 33:43.271
Elena Flores had been my roommate.

33:43.291 --> 33:44.412
She was in sociology.

33:47.074 --> 33:49.337
But actually, she was going to go in my class.

33:50.258 --> 33:51.599
And so there was a bunch of us.

33:51.739 --> 33:53.281
And Roberto was really pushing that too.

33:54.302 --> 33:57.505
So there was Juana, Mora.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.893
Well, I guess it was just a couple of us.

34:02.654 --> 34:06.738
So we applied so that we thought, because I was really into economics.

34:06.818 --> 34:08.560
I was an econ major.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.802
And then I had gone to Mexico to study Marxism.

34:10.822 --> 34:16.308
So I was really excited about political economy and Marxist economics.

34:17.029 --> 34:25.838
And so I applied to grad school, got into Berkeley, got into American University, and got into UMass at Amherst.

34:26.678 --> 34:27.999
But I've met Jaime.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.623
So dang it.

34:31.643 --> 34:33.665
I should have gone to American is what I should have done.

34:34.386 --> 34:36.648
But I didn't want to leave him.

34:37.709 --> 34:46.458
And so because Berkeley said, well, we'll admit you, but you have to come and you have to take these courses because you're weak on your math.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.025
So I had just gotten a job teaching at Colegio de la Tierra in Fresno, which is like a agriculture.

34:53.045 --> 34:55.808
I don't know if it's still there, but so

34:56.092 --> 34:56.533
I don't know.

34:56.553 --> 35:00.719
In hindsight, I wish I had just done that and just not even gone to any graduate school.

35:00.759 --> 35:03.183
Just done that for a while and then just figured out what I wanted to do.

35:04.005 --> 35:05.347
But hindsight is 20-20.

35:05.547 --> 35:11.717
And so I wanted to go to American because I was more like it was in D.C.

35:11.797 --> 35:15.583
and it was more kind of policy oriented and stuff.

35:15.603 --> 35:18.167
So anyway, but I didn't want to leave.

35:19.126 --> 35:27.277
So I went to Cal and I had to go to summer school for that.

35:27.558 --> 35:34.207
So I had to decline the teaching position at Colegio de la Tierra, which was like, oh, I hated to do that.

35:34.908 --> 35:35.809
Yeah, so I went back.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.874
I had to take linear algebra and I don't know what else.

35:38.894 --> 35:40.215
So you ended up at Berkeley.

35:40.235 --> 35:41.157
I ended up at Berkeley.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.480
How did you and Jaime meet?

35:47.527 --> 35:52.151
Well, I'm just curious if you met him, like, through all the stuff you were doing with Mesh.

35:52.172 --> 35:52.472
I met him.

35:52.492 --> 35:53.833
Okay, so I went to Mexico.

35:54.714 --> 35:58.257
I went to Mexico my junior year, and that's when I had to leave Los Mexicas.

35:58.277 --> 35:58.678
I hated it.

35:58.778 --> 36:02.522
Once you started doing folklore dance, you just can't stop.

36:02.602 --> 36:04.523
It's just so, like, fun, you know?

36:05.324 --> 36:09.668
And so that's when I stopped dancing, and that's when I had to leave the Pajada Learning Project.

36:09.688 --> 36:13.332
And so I went to Mexico, and I fell in love with a lawyer.

36:13.868 --> 36:20.410
And it was very kind of a tumultuous relationship because he was very macho.

36:20.430 --> 36:21.313
I mean, like...

36:22.593 --> 36:25.076
One day with a bus.

36:25.136 --> 36:26.758
This is not Jaime you're talking about.

36:26.778 --> 36:27.139
This is not Jaime.

36:27.159 --> 36:28.180
This is this guy in Mexico.

36:28.621 --> 36:28.721
Yeah.

36:28.741 --> 36:31.464
This guy like just accidentally just brushed his shoulder.

36:31.985 --> 36:33.106
We wanted to fight him right there.

36:34.027 --> 36:37.712
And then my TA came over to see me, my Marxist Egonomics TA.

36:38.833 --> 36:39.534
He came over.

36:39.955 --> 36:42.278
I mean, I was going to go to Acapulco with him.

36:42.818 --> 36:44.320
So, of course, my boyfriend was jealous.

36:44.340 --> 36:45.361
So he walked down.

36:46.182 --> 36:48.606
It reminded me of a rooster.

36:49.186 --> 36:50.608
He came down.

36:50.909 --> 36:54.573
looked at him, walked all the way around him, and went back inside.

37:00.058 --> 37:00.899
I was so naive.

37:00.979 --> 37:02.520
I was like, look, he's my TA.

37:03.361 --> 37:04.462
I told him about you.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.104
You're my boyfriend.

37:06.124 --> 37:07.465
He just saw you.

37:07.525 --> 37:08.586
What's the problem?

37:08.606 --> 37:13.071
But of course, he was going to have a problem with it because it was my TA and his friend and his girlfriend.

37:14.252 --> 37:16.274
And sure enough, when we got in the car, he tried to get my hand.

37:16.294 --> 37:18.656
I was like, hey.

37:18.676 --> 37:18.756
Hey.

37:21.892 --> 37:26.078
So I ended up on the beach in Acapulco by myself body surfing with a bunch of only guys.

37:26.158 --> 37:28.121
The waves in Acapulco were just like amazing.

37:28.141 --> 37:29.483
Really, I can't believe I did that.

37:29.503 --> 37:30.345
It was great.

37:30.405 --> 37:32.127
I love body surfing.

37:32.147 --> 37:36.053
But, yeah, so anyway, so I met him.

37:36.073 --> 37:38.497
So when I came back, I was like heartbroken.

37:39.638 --> 37:41.040
And I had been drinking a lot.

37:41.501 --> 37:44.465
When I used to go to Garibaldi, you're going to be careful.

37:45.587 --> 37:45.948
I'm going to edit.

37:45.968 --> 37:46.228
That's right.

37:46.748 --> 37:51.677
I used to go to Garibaldi, and you could tell me if you don't want to stick in there or not.

37:51.697 --> 37:52.459
We would sing.

37:52.779 --> 37:56.707
We would sing, you know, Garibaldi, mariachi, and drink, you know?

37:56.727 --> 38:05.243
And so when I got back, so he asked me to marry me, but he was such a jerk.

38:05.343 --> 38:06.225
It was like...

38:06.982 --> 38:11.931
Oh, and then my friend Andres, who had a crush on me, I was so sonsai, you know, I didn't realize it.

38:11.971 --> 38:13.393
I thought he was just my friend, you know.

38:14.014 --> 38:17.260
But he went to visit me, he and his mom, and so they went to visit me.

38:17.340 --> 38:20.786
So, of course, I introduced him to my boyfriend, and again, my boyfriend had a cow about it.

38:20.906 --> 38:23.050
So I was like, you're a jerk, you know.

38:23.553 --> 38:46.050
so he was just too macho and then he asked me to marry him out of the blue after we've been having all this fighting and i'm like and it just came out of my mouth like i didn't even and then afterwards i said oops he was serious anyway i really i really was in love with him and so when i came back i was heartbroken and then in the fall

38:46.537 --> 38:49.001
So that was the fall of my senior year.

38:49.842 --> 38:53.929
Juana had been dating this guy, Juan Garcia, the anthropologist, who your dad knows.

38:53.949 --> 38:56.814
He's in Fresno now.

38:57.775 --> 39:01.922
He was dating my friend, my roommate, Juana Mora.

39:03.985 --> 39:13.000
And so he said, oh, he told Juana, hey, I have, you know, my friend, you know, would be good for Lupe.

39:13.823 --> 39:16.087
Because Jaime was an organizer.

39:16.107 --> 39:17.389
He was organizing cannery workers.

39:18.390 --> 39:22.677
And so I went... So Juan was having a party over here on River Street.

39:23.498 --> 39:27.825
And so a bunch of the girls from Santa Cruz, you know, were coming to San Jose to a party, you know.

39:28.426 --> 39:29.207
And I got really drunk.

39:30.449 --> 39:31.851
And so I came out.

39:31.871 --> 39:33.614
So Juan had told me about him.

39:33.674 --> 39:34.275
And so I went out.

39:34.315 --> 39:36.118
He was talking to this other girl.

39:37.340 --> 39:38.582
And...

39:39.457 --> 39:42.582
She had been his 2T, because he knew her from San Jose.

39:42.762 --> 39:45.687
And anyway, they were just talking, and so I went over there and asked him to dance.

39:47.129 --> 39:48.572
And he was like, no.

39:48.592 --> 40:00.371
And it was like, this guy, this greasy-haired, bespectacled, khaki guy, and, like, didn't even change to come to the party.

40:00.491 --> 40:02.134
It's like, mm.

40:02.154 --> 40:06.561
But he's a lawyer, so he sounds like he's a community organizer, so.

40:07.081 --> 40:34.405
yeah okay maybe he's kind of cute you know but then he said no so i i just went to the room and i passed out wanted to say here lay down a bit so i laid down i passed out at the end of the party it was like one of the morning she came and she woke me up and she's like we're gonna go get some coffee we're gonna go to i house or something or i hop and so so i got up and and i got in the car and it was like

40:34.756 --> 40:37.521
We're all crowded in there, and so I had to sit on his lap.

40:41.830 --> 40:42.832
Anyway, yeah.

40:43.473 --> 40:45.036
So that's how I met him.

40:47.140 --> 40:52.992
But then, so I went to Berkeley, and I was the only Chicana there, the only person of color, actually.

40:53.092 --> 40:56.258
But there was a couple of Latinos, three of them from Chile.

40:56.744 --> 41:00.108
But they were very owning class and I couldn't relate to them.

41:01.270 --> 41:02.511
But I had a horrible time.

41:02.772 --> 41:04.314
It was just torture.

41:05.335 --> 41:09.040
It wasn't what I thought it was.

41:09.120 --> 41:13.585
It was so theoretical and it was all math.

41:13.765 --> 41:25.300
It was just theorems and capitalism is like

41:25.600 --> 41:32.049
you know, perfect because there's, I mean, it was just the assumptions were just heroic assumptions.

41:32.750 --> 41:40.440
And I just, I just, you know, being a Marxist and then going into neoclassical economics, it was just like, oh, it's torture.

41:40.460 --> 41:43.704
And then I was like, oh, very male, very white male.

41:44.806 --> 41:45.046
Yeah.

41:45.847 --> 41:50.714
Came to find out a lot of them already had masters, you know, and here I was fresh out of undergrad.

41:51.234 --> 41:52.957
Anyway, it was just bad.

41:53.077 --> 41:54.038
It was just hard.

41:54.355 --> 42:00.262
So I failed my first econ, my first class.

42:02.284 --> 42:04.427
And I was just mortified.

42:04.467 --> 42:07.530
It was like so shameful, you know.

42:08.171 --> 42:09.873
And then I had to, what did I have to do?

42:09.913 --> 42:15.720
I think I had a meeting with a committee in these three white men.

42:16.861 --> 42:17.522
They were so weird.

42:17.542 --> 42:21.747
And so many economists have these like tics, you know, so some of them are like,

42:23.228 --> 42:51.835
that one or or I just weird ticks you know I thought what is wrong with these people well one of them anyway at least one of them very famous people you know no they are you know Nobel Prize winning later they became at least one of them became a Nobel Prize winning economist but they were all like like trying to figure out what to do with me and they're like well and so I had taken

42:52.675 --> 42:57.262
I had failed that class, but then I had taken a class with this professor.

42:57.962 --> 42:58.483
What was his name?

42:58.503 --> 42:59.525
He said a French name.

43:00.406 --> 43:02.329
He was teaching a political economy class.

43:03.410 --> 43:04.772
And so, of course, I got an A in that.

43:05.133 --> 43:08.217
They're like, well, but you got an A in this class, but then you failed this class.

43:09.138 --> 43:17.070
Well, we think that you are more interested in policy, so we would like to recommend that you go to a policy school.

43:17.951 --> 43:19.493
We think that would be a better fit for you.

43:21.532 --> 43:31.742
Well, being that I was very angry and I was very anti-authority, I mean, they probably were thinking well about me, honestly.

43:31.762 --> 43:34.484
But I was like, oh, hell no.

43:35.025 --> 43:37.727
I'm going to show you that I can do this.

43:38.528 --> 43:39.389
I'm going to show you.

43:41.731 --> 43:42.331
And you did?

43:42.352 --> 43:46.155
At a great cost.

43:46.175 --> 43:49.338
But I would say it was a great cost.

43:49.798 --> 43:51.420
So that was the hard part.

43:51.822 --> 44:21.542
The wonderful part and the fun part was that I was part of a group of people, the new PhDs, the pipeline, Tomasa Maguer, Felipe Gonzalez, both in sociology, Elena Flores, Denise Segura, Beatriz Pesquera, Julia Curry, all these, this group of people, Pat Zavella, who were in grad school.

44:22.012 --> 44:24.816
And we were transforming that institution as well.

44:25.377 --> 44:35.172
So we created TPEC, the Chicano Political Economy Collective, which, I mean, I never published, it was a working paper series.

44:35.192 --> 44:38.037
And at that time, there was, what's his name?

44:38.357 --> 44:39.619
I haven't thought about this stuff in years.

44:40.340 --> 44:42.904
The World Systems guy, what was his name?

44:46.029 --> 44:46.590
Wallerstein?

44:46.610 --> 44:48.313
Yeah, Wallerstein.

44:48.373 --> 44:49.234
And so it was like,

44:49.771 --> 44:53.296
So Tomás wrote a piece in there about Chicanos in the world system.

44:53.516 --> 45:08.556
And so it was, I think that CHIPEC sort of advanced the thinking around, or at least inserted the Chicanos role in the world system kind of thing.

45:08.917 --> 45:16.026
And the series of papers that were later published, so that was a big contribution.

45:17.388 --> 45:18.850
Did you say CHIPEC?

45:18.965 --> 45:20.927
Yeah.

45:20.968 --> 45:23.851
The Chicano Political Economy Collective.

45:23.871 --> 45:24.011
Oh.

45:24.552 --> 45:25.293
Okay.

45:25.313 --> 45:26.675
And it was a working paper series.

45:26.735 --> 45:32.682
And then I think they were later published somewhere else, but I'd have to find out where.

45:33.784 --> 45:34.785
So we did that.

45:34.805 --> 45:39.310
And we used to have these meetings, you know, where we would come together and we would, like, talk.

45:39.951 --> 45:42.755
And we were multidisciplinary because, well, most of them were in sociology.

45:42.815 --> 45:44.978
Pat was in Anthro.

45:45.698 --> 45:46.980
I was the only one in econ.

45:47.382 --> 45:49.645
And then Dina Gonzalez was in history.

45:50.305 --> 45:52.328
So we had some representation.

45:52.808 --> 45:54.951
So we were definitely multidisciplinary.

45:57.414 --> 45:59.876
So that was one thing that we did over the years.

46:00.017 --> 46:02.760
And then we started MOCS.

46:03.541 --> 46:05.002
You know about MOCS, right?

46:05.022 --> 46:09.087
Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social.

46:09.505 --> 46:23.298
Well, they're now probably in their, again, their 40th year, and the goal of that originally was to make it a more welcoming environment for women, for Mexican-American women, Chicano women.

46:24.099 --> 46:35.310
Margarita Melville was, I think she was there at Berkeley, I think she had just been hired, but it was basically, oh, what's her, Ada, Ada,

46:36.067 --> 46:38.613
Ada, the political scientist who was at Davis.

46:38.974 --> 46:41.461
Ada, oh gosh, I'm not remembering her name.

46:41.561 --> 46:42.704
Is it Hurtado?

46:43.145 --> 46:45.050
No, no, that's Aida Hurtado from Santa Cruz.

46:45.070 --> 46:46.233
No, this is Ada.

46:47.155 --> 46:48.699
She was older.

46:48.719 --> 46:49.682
Well, she was older than us.

46:49.942 --> 46:51.426
She was already in her 50s.

46:51.845 --> 46:53.667
Her name will come to me.

46:54.067 --> 46:58.271
So Ada Sosa Riddell.

46:58.291 --> 46:59.192
Ada Sosa Riddell.

46:59.512 --> 47:07.700
And she and Beatriz Pesquera and all of us, we created this organization, Mujeres Activas and Netas de Cambio Social.

47:08.321 --> 47:11.323
And we started, so it was a collaboration.

47:11.504 --> 47:13.225
I mean, well, Davis, well, she was at Davis.

47:13.285 --> 47:13.946
We were at Berkeley.

47:14.446 --> 47:15.527
So that's kind of how it started.

47:15.547 --> 47:17.209
So we would have an annual conference.

47:17.229 --> 47:19.691
And they continue to have annual conferences now.

47:19.711 --> 47:21.413
I think they're funded now by I don't know who.

47:21.950 --> 47:26.195
So I was really active in malls, active in CHIPEC.

47:27.236 --> 47:34.785
And then at Berkeley, we had Mujeres, what was it called now?

47:34.805 --> 47:35.506
I'm blanking the name.

47:36.827 --> 47:42.894
But Alex Zaragoza famously said, do you know Alex Zaragoza, the historian?

47:42.914 --> 47:46.438
Yeah, I just met him a couple, last month.

47:47.313 --> 47:58.144
He was giving a talk in Fresno, and I reached out to him to participate, and he said yes, but I haven't heard back from him, so maybe he'll... Yeah, you have to pursue his people.

47:58.164 --> 47:58.264
Yeah.

47:59.025 --> 48:03.369
Alex famously said, Mujeres... What did he say?

48:06.012 --> 48:10.276
Oh, because we started another group, it was called Mujeres en Marcha, and that was just at Berkeley.

48:11.257 --> 48:14.180
He said, Mujeres en Marcha, hombres corriendo.

48:15.402 --> 48:15.902
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

48:19.662 --> 48:23.650
So, yeah.

48:23.670 --> 48:28.599
So after your time at Berkeley, you went on to do a PhD as well, right?

48:30.001 --> 48:30.643
Well, I did a PhD.

48:30.663 --> 48:31.685
I was doing a PhD there.

48:31.945 --> 48:33.308
Oh, you were at Berkeley.

48:33.328 --> 48:33.468
Yeah.

48:33.668 --> 48:34.009
Oh, okay.

48:34.029 --> 48:38.818
I thought you were, I don't know, for some reason I thought that's why you guys were in Washington.

48:39.271 --> 48:42.597
No, when I got my doctorate, then I got a job in Washington.

48:42.618 --> 48:43.219
Oh, I see.

48:43.499 --> 48:44.040
Okay.

48:44.060 --> 48:45.283
Teaching economics.

48:45.784 --> 48:48.609
No, actually I was teaching in the American Ethnic Studies Department.

48:48.729 --> 48:51.455
After what I went through, I did not want to teach economics.

48:51.976 --> 48:54.961
I couldn't see myself teaching neoclassical economics.

48:55.022 --> 48:58.669
Maybe macro, but no.

48:58.789 --> 48:58.849
No.

48:59.403 --> 49:00.344
It was just too boring.

49:00.984 --> 49:06.710
So I was teaching, actually, ethnic studies.

49:07.570 --> 49:09.092
I developed a couple of courses.

49:09.452 --> 49:16.919
One was gender technology and something else.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.863
So I developed that course and I developed.

49:21.203 --> 49:25.987
I used to teach the intro to Chicano studies and Latinos in the U.S.

49:26.007 --> 49:28.870
economy, courses like that.

49:30.132 --> 49:56.663
so you ended up uh so you you were doing like um university or like higher education teaching though yeah that's what you're doing um and then let me see if there's anything i want to kind of follow up on that so it sounds to me like you're saying that there was a lot of inspiration from the chicago movement in its

49:56.845 --> 49:59.908
quote-unquote heyday whenever that is.

50:00.028 --> 50:01.870
That was inspiring for you.

50:02.911 --> 50:23.169
You ended up going to Santa Cruz, getting involved with Mecha there, and then when you went to Berkeley, kind of helping to start and become really active in these different kinds of programs or collectives maybe in some way.

50:23.309 --> 50:26.532
Oh yeah, then we also had the Chicana Colectiva before that.

50:27.035 --> 50:28.457
because I was in grad school for like 10 years.

50:29.659 --> 50:33.945
Yeah, we had the Chicana Colectiva.

50:35.647 --> 50:39.853
And we did a slideshow, it was called Chicanas in the Labor Force.

50:40.634 --> 50:45.581
And then we used to tour that around to different little colleges and give little lectures on that.

50:47.444 --> 50:49.507
And we just used to meet as women also.

50:51.350 --> 50:56.637
But I mean, I don't know if I ever really thought of it as the Chicano movement.

50:57.477 --> 51:05.546
because or even the ideology of it, but it was more like that was what was happening at the time.

51:05.586 --> 51:08.589
It's like we're trying to transform these institutions.

51:08.709 --> 51:16.498
We're trying to make ourselves more visible and to really get more professors there.

51:16.518 --> 51:20.502
I mean, that was like a big push, you know, to get more Latinos hired.

51:21.843 --> 51:25.307
So we brought actually David Montejano,

51:25.827 --> 51:28.289
I believe he was, he was, he was at Harvard.

51:28.309 --> 51:34.534
So he came to do his, he was from Texas, got his PhD, was working on his PhD at Harvard.

51:34.635 --> 51:41.480
And then we got him to teach a class at Berkeley and then not Harvard, Yale.

51:42.521 --> 51:50.888
And then when he, and then, and then we didn't, so we, we got him to teach as a lecturer.

51:51.309 --> 51:55.092
And then years later he came back as a professor, but, um,

51:56.506 --> 51:58.749
Yeah, just trying to get more faculty there.

51:58.769 --> 52:06.177
I guess I was just trying to think of your Misty Sahic question.

52:07.259 --> 52:09.541
Well, we'll get there in a minute.

52:11.263 --> 52:11.363
Okay.

52:11.383 --> 52:24.639
Well, but I think it is kind of in the spirit of the Chicano movement if part of what that movement was about was promoting self-determination.

52:25.360 --> 52:25.500
Mm-hmm.

52:25.531 --> 52:50.712
then it seems like a lot of that activity that you guys were involved in would would definitely fall under that category I think absolutely yeah absolutely yeah so um that's really interesting uh I didn't know any of that part of your history I have a very like you know oh here's my dad's friend Lupe and

52:51.333 --> 52:54.256
I know she got a PhD and that's all I know.

52:54.316 --> 52:58.702
But that's really interesting.

52:58.942 --> 53:01.765
And it's funny because you mentioned Julia Curry.

53:01.925 --> 53:06.130
She's one of my advisors on my... I know.

53:06.150 --> 53:06.971
She's here at State.

53:07.412 --> 53:09.254
Yeah.

53:11.176 --> 53:12.257
But she got her PhD.

53:12.497 --> 53:13.919
I don't... Because she wasn't at Berkeley.

53:13.939 --> 53:16.542
She only came to Berkeley for like a short period.

53:16.562 --> 53:18.184
And she was Julia Curry...

53:20.324 --> 53:22.486
Rodriguez or something like that at that time.

53:23.167 --> 53:23.748
Yeah.

53:23.768 --> 53:24.889
She still goes by.

53:24.949 --> 53:25.570
Oh, she is still.

53:26.050 --> 53:26.431
Oh, yeah.

53:27.372 --> 53:27.612
Yeah.

53:27.632 --> 53:30.615
And I, I thought she went to Berkeley, but I could be wrong.

53:31.436 --> 53:31.776
I could be wrong.

53:31.796 --> 53:33.738
No, I don't, I think she got a degree somewhere else.

53:33.798 --> 53:37.983
I want to say that she, cause I remember she was only there for a little while.

53:38.003 --> 53:45.311
Um, but that's where she met Kathy, her, her partner, you know, Kathy, no, I don't think so.

53:46.152 --> 53:47.293
She works at the library at the,

53:47.425 --> 54:09.602
okay so let me then kind of switch gears unless there's anything else you want to add about that particular time frame or anything like that okay

54:10.088 --> 54:22.302
So yeah, so my main question or the question that I'm looking at for my dissertation is about mestizaje ideology.

54:22.322 --> 54:38.340
And part of the reason why I'm conducting this history, this oral history is because there is, what I've found is that there's kind of a gap between mestizaje

54:38.995 --> 54:47.584
in Mexico being kind of promoted and then it's, it's adoption during the Chicano movement.

54:47.604 --> 54:55.312
And so I kind of wanted to look at what's going on in that gap.

54:55.492 --> 54:58.115
How did there is a gap, right?

54:58.915 --> 55:05.442
How did people who were involved in the Chicano movement, where did they,

55:06.535 --> 55:10.560
How did they kind of like come up with this idea?

55:10.580 --> 55:12.422
Where were they picking it up from?

55:13.363 --> 55:15.486
And what were their thoughts on it, right?

55:15.566 --> 55:17.428
What were their particular thoughts on it?

55:18.850 --> 55:23.195
And so that's kind of what I'm working on specifically with this project.

55:23.335 --> 55:27.160
I mean, the dissertation itself is a lot

55:27.663 --> 55:33.270
Larger, but this is a very specific thing I'm doing for for just one chapter actually.

55:33.471 --> 55:37.035
Oh my god.

55:38.617 --> 55:54.278
Yeah, so so I I wanted to know what are your What are you like are you familiar with mestizaje the idea or concept of mestizaje, mestizo, mestiza?

55:54.983 --> 56:03.632
And if you can recollect when you maybe first became aware of it or what your views on it are.

56:03.652 --> 56:07.035
And we can kind of come back to each of those questions.

56:08.376 --> 56:11.800
Well, I mean, for me, it's just thinking about identity.

56:11.820 --> 56:22.611
And I mean, my dad, he would tease me because I was very much into like equality, you know, because I grew up with three brothers.

56:22.631 --> 56:24.012
And so it was like,

56:24.447 --> 56:29.756
I became a feminist real early because it was like, we all had to wash the dishes.

56:29.776 --> 56:34.002
We had made an arrangement that all of us, all four of us would wash the dishes and we'd take turns.

56:34.063 --> 56:36.046
Okay, we used to wash them in pairs.

56:36.066 --> 56:46.483
And then one, my brother turned 15 and he said, I'm no longer gonna wash dishes because I turned 15 and I'm a man now with some bullshit.

56:46.563 --> 56:47.464
Some bullshit like that.

56:48.165 --> 56:49.728
I was furious.

56:49.868 --> 56:51.130
I was like, what the?

56:51.683 --> 56:52.364
What am I?

56:52.584 --> 56:55.387
You know, it's like, no, you know, this is not okay.

56:55.668 --> 56:58.731
And my dad and my mom backed him up.

56:58.751 --> 57:02.375
I was like, oh, you know.

57:05.819 --> 57:11.305
So my dad and I would have these discussions and I'd say, because he want my brother to go with me to the dance or something.

57:11.365 --> 57:12.627
I'd say, por qué?

57:12.947 --> 57:14.549
Por qué no puedo ir yo con mis amigas?

57:14.869 --> 57:15.430
Por qué no?

57:15.967 --> 57:27.125
It's like, oh, it just irritated me.

57:28.247 --> 57:33.615
And so I was very aware of the sexism and then of equality.

57:33.635 --> 57:40.807
So I would say, he'd say, I'd say, because they were very prejudiced, they'd say against African-Americans.

57:41.708 --> 57:42.750
And they'd say,

57:43.270 --> 58:12.568
no I said no yo me voy a casar con un negro and he said tu te vas a casar con un indio pata rajada it's like what yo me voy a casar con quien yo quiera you know so we would have these arguments all the time um but so I mean I definitely have had knew that I was Mexican but I knew I wasn't Mexican like he was Mexican I knew that I was

58:13.055 --> 58:21.346
I realized that there was a blending process or some process where it was like I had different consciousness than my dad.

58:22.888 --> 58:28.897
But I knew that he identified more as like Mexican, like Indio or something like that.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.241
Where was he from in Mexico?

58:32.261 --> 58:33.423
He was from Zacatecas.

58:34.324 --> 58:38.029
Oh, that's where my mom's family is from Zacatecas.

58:38.329 --> 58:41.053
Yeah, he was from Nochistlan, Zacatecas.

58:41.810 --> 58:45.093
And my mom was from San Luis Potosi.

58:46.014 --> 58:47.074
Same, isn't it?

58:47.095 --> 58:47.395
Really?

58:47.615 --> 58:50.057
Yeah.

58:50.277 --> 58:58.344
Yeah, my mom's dad's side of the family is from San Luis Potosi, and her mom's side of the family is from Zacatecas.

58:58.364 --> 58:58.504
Oh.

58:59.125 --> 59:00.926
Yeah, so it's not too far, I guess.

59:01.387 --> 59:03.328
That was the early sending regions, right?

59:03.368 --> 59:04.489
The earlier sending regions.

59:05.510 --> 59:11.175
But I don't know.

59:12.370 --> 59:28.906
Yeah, so you were saying your dad, that you felt that you identified different, you both identified as Mexican, but that there was some kind of difference because he was from Mexico, you're from here, growing up in this culture, I'm assuming.

59:29.407 --> 59:30.588
Yeah.

59:30.608 --> 59:36.513
And that his identification was maybe a little more towards the India side.

59:36.694 --> 59:36.974
Yeah.

59:37.915 --> 59:38.175
Mm-hmm.

59:39.674 --> 59:44.141
I mean, he did not identify as a Spaniard, even though his father was a Spaniard.

59:45.463 --> 59:47.987
I mean, direct from Spain, his dad was.

59:48.988 --> 59:54.897
But he always described them as being very mean, just mean.

01:00:01.006 --> 01:00:05.293
So if I'm hearing you right, are you saying that this,

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:18.341
idea of mestizaje or mestizo was something that you were aware of at an early age, like when you were still, you know, living with your parents and stuff?

01:00:18.561 --> 01:00:20.805
I don't know if I would say that.

01:00:20.825 --> 01:00:25.172
I mean, I definitely knew that I was not white.

01:00:27.797 --> 01:00:28.858
I don't know what to say.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.344
Yeah.

01:00:32.915 --> 01:00:59.833
When you went to Santa Cruz and to Berkeley, were you, did you ever notice if some of those types of narratives were being used in connection with, you know, either the Chicano movement or the things that you were doing with Mecha or... Well, I know that people were reading Los de Abajo

01:01:00.337 --> 01:01:10.493
And we were reading Barrio Boy and reading, those are some of the books that people were reading in their classes, in their classes.

01:01:11.374 --> 01:01:13.818
And I took Ralph Guzman's class.

01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:17.083
Ralph Guzman was the only Latino professor we had at the time.

01:01:17.403 --> 01:01:21.009
Well, we had Jeannie Bianchi, who was Latina.

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:22.711
She was in education.

01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:28.420
But he taught the intro to, I guess it was Latin American Studies, or I don't know if it was a Chicano Studies class.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.743
But all the Chiganos took that class.

01:01:31.984 --> 01:01:35.629
And I think for that class, we had to read books like that.

01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:57.597
So it kind of put in print, I guess, what I was feeling of being rejected for being Mexican or being mistreated for being Mexican.

01:01:58.572 --> 01:02:24.867
and how would you how do you understand what that concept means now or as well as you've gone through all this and maybe how do I understand it now yeah I really thought about it very much but

01:02:26.433 --> 01:02:31.460
I mean, I think there's so much blending, you know, so much blending.

01:02:34.163 --> 01:02:46.279
I mean, there was blending back then, but I feel like there's even more now across just brown and white, but also Asian, a lot more ethnic, intra-ethnic blending.

01:02:49.563 --> 01:02:50.905
But what was your question again?

01:02:51.728 --> 01:03:18.529
now i was just asking if you had any different or more kind of fuller thoughts about the concept since you've been you know since you've gone through all the education that you had all the years of life experience that you've had and uh whether that has given you any kind of

01:03:20.534 --> 01:03:49.123
different thoughts on it than maybe when you were in school um i guess well like like when i like my girls like when i ask them how do you identify but when people ask you where are you from you know we just say they just say mexican you know they don't say chicano or they don't say mexican-american they just say mexican um and i guess

01:03:50.015 --> 01:03:56.621
I would be, I guess if you say, you know, they used to say Chicano is a Mexican-American with an attitude, right?

01:03:56.641 --> 01:03:57.342
They used to say that.

01:03:57.982 --> 01:04:13.316
But now it's like, well, it's more of a contradiction to say you're Mexican, especially in this era that Mexicans are under attack, you know, than to say, oh, I'm Chicano, because it feels like, well, what does that even mean anymore?

01:04:13.336 --> 01:04:17.440
It's more like a dated, it feels like it's like a dated term now.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:17.760
And

01:04:18.044 --> 01:04:22.110
Like the new generation, they don't use that language.

01:04:22.851 --> 01:04:32.605
So I think it's more of an advance, really, to say that you were Mexican, even though you weren't born in Mexico.

01:04:32.625 --> 01:04:47.646
You know, saying you're Mexican in this era of Mexicans being demeaned and targeted as thieves and criminals, you know, I think that's more of a contradiction to that and a reclaiming of, like,

01:04:48.385 --> 01:05:17.413
so yeah uh well one thing I find interesting about the whole I you know I identify as Mexican or what have you is um that you know Mexican like you hear a lot of people say Mexican is not a race Mexican is a nationality it's a nation right

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.124
And, um, and so when you ask people like, oh, how did they identify?

01:05:24.025 --> 01:05:33.894
And they say Mexican that this kind of like underlying, you know, that it seems like the question is really what race are you?

01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:37.938
So when you answer Mexican, you're not telling me what your race is.

01:05:38.058 --> 01:05:39.239
Right.

01:05:39.259 --> 01:05:44.904
And so I think it's, I think it's funny because I think there is something to be said on both sides.

01:05:45.364 --> 01:05:46.806
Like, yes, you're right.

01:05:46.866 --> 01:05:48.227
It is a nation, right?

01:05:48.511 --> 01:06:15.328
um but at the same time it speaks to the culture of the people that are there and uh you know if it doesn't fit into that racial category then do that but um because otherwise you say what race are you on white yes well or there's people who say that they're indigenous

01:06:16.456 --> 01:06:31.960
Maybe I would just ask about, what about your mother?

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:36.827
Did she also identify as indigenous?

01:06:38.123 --> 01:06:39.345
That's a good question.

01:06:39.866 --> 01:06:41.027
I don't think so.

01:06:41.047 --> 01:06:43.431
I mean, I don't think we ever talked about that.

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:47.798
She would probably just say she was Mexicana.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.004
Her grandfather was straight from Spain.

01:06:52.485 --> 01:07:01.018
So her grandmother was very native and very, she remembers her as being very petite and very small and very dark.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.287
But she definitely had, both of my parents were very light skinned and

01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:12.217
they were both very color prejudice, you know.

01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:18.523
My aunt was going to marry a guy from Texas, and he was very dark, Indian looking, and they really despised him.

01:07:19.023 --> 01:07:22.286
They would just call him El Indio, El Mojica.

01:07:22.727 --> 01:07:24.068
I mean, they were really mean.

01:07:24.848 --> 01:07:37.560
And my mom, well, actually one time I had a conversation with her later, in her later years, and I said, Mama, tu identificas, you know, a beauty with color, you know.

01:07:38.249 --> 01:07:41.854
And I think that's the first time she ever, like, really thought about it, because she'd say, oh, está perieto.

01:07:42.175 --> 01:07:44.939
And that automatically meant you were ugly, you know.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:53.211
And so I think I did ask her about that, or I did mention to her, you know, just because somebody's dark doesn't mean they're ugly, you know.

01:07:53.852 --> 01:07:57.939
And I think she kind of had, like, she actually listened and maybe reflected on it a little bit.

01:07:57.959 --> 01:08:02.986
But up until then, I mean, she passed that on to us, you know, the colorism stuff, you know.

01:08:03.267 --> 01:08:06.872
Está perieto, pues, that automatically that's just,

01:08:07.223 --> 01:08:07.664
You're ugly.

01:08:08.425 --> 01:08:09.166
You're dark.

01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:16.997
So for her, identity and beauty was more about being light skinned.

01:08:18.419 --> 01:08:25.349
Yeah.

01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:33.621
How do you identify yourself?

01:08:33.661 --> 01:08:35.644
Do you identify as Mexican?

01:08:37.177 --> 01:08:41.863
I really haven't thought about it very much anymore because it's like I'm not in those settings anymore.

01:08:42.304 --> 01:08:43.545
Yeah.

01:08:43.565 --> 01:08:54.079
And so I've been working as a clinical social worker and working mostly with immigrant families, Mexican, well, Colombian, Latino immigrant families and their children.

01:08:56.082 --> 01:09:02.510
So that really doesn't come up as long as I speak Spanish.

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:07.116
Once in a while they would ask me, ¿de dónde eres?,

01:09:07.585 --> 01:09:09.507
And I'd say, mis padres son de México.

01:09:10.328 --> 01:09:12.851
Y yo soy Mexicana criado aquí, criada aquí.

01:09:14.273 --> 01:09:17.657
Because if I tell them soy Chicana, I don't think they would understand that.

01:09:17.797 --> 01:09:20.440
They wouldn't really know what that was.

01:09:20.861 --> 01:09:21.341
Yeah.

01:09:21.621 --> 01:09:33.155
So I hear that a lot too, that like the Chicanos and Chicanas or the offspring of Chicanos and Chicanas, right?

01:09:33.195 --> 01:09:37.440
Like myself and maybe like my generation.

01:09:37.994 --> 01:09:49.113
that we're being outnumbered by Mexicans or, you know, Guatemalans or Salvadorians, whatever, right?

01:09:49.974 --> 01:09:51.897
Is that true?

01:09:52.258 --> 01:09:57.286
Honestly, I don't know, but, like, I don't know the actual numbers.

01:09:57.306 --> 01:09:58.909
Like, I hear it a lot, right?

01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:02.415
That there's such an influx of

01:10:02.783 --> 01:10:32.352
immigrants right that and and their children and the children that they're having right and and then we just haven't been like good enough at and explaining what chicanismo is or like that whole history that it's been lost or something with the children of the chicanos you know no well both a little bit but mainly for like people who are new here

01:10:33.344 --> 01:11:00.634
people who are yeah people who are you know maybe their parents are immigrants students right now his parents are immigrants maybe they themselves are immigrants as well so um yeah interesting dynamics we would run into that because the people all the time but sometimes uh the the people who were from who were more like more recent arrivals

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:08.792
they were not, they tended to be more successful, you know, than the ones that were born here.

01:11:08.812 --> 01:11:15.259
Um, and then of course they would, they would benefit from all the programs that were for the Chicanos.

01:11:15.279 --> 01:11:16.541
Um, but they didn't have the consciousness.

01:11:17.181 --> 01:11:27.853
And so they would go on to become just regular businessmen without any, any feeling of like they had owed a debt to the community or anything like that, you know?

01:11:28.103 --> 01:11:34.811
And I really resent those people.

01:11:35.472 --> 01:11:41.659
Yeah, because they did not experience the racism.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:56.136
They came here when they were adults or they were more, you know, they were 12, 13, 14, 15 when they already had their identity and they felt proud of,

01:11:56.504 --> 01:12:24.216
they hadn't been they had not experienced racism early on and so they they were able to to just whatever whenever if they were put down or whatever they already had their like identity intact already and so it was like you know they they wouldn't believe it they'd know who they were and they were firm in their language also so they weren't ashamed you know whereas those of us that grew up and experienced all of that racism and

01:12:24.854 --> 01:12:34.426
and oppression, classist oppression, you know, we had to work through the internalized racism in order to, like, reclaim who we were.

01:12:34.466 --> 01:12:37.309
I mean, we had to go through a whole process, and some people never do.

01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:38.911
Yeah.

01:12:38.931 --> 01:12:46.500
Whereas these people who came in, it's already their ego, or whatever you want to say, is already... It's not fractured.

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.782
Yeah, it hasn't been fractured.

01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:52.988
They're able to just move on and have, I think, a little bit of an easier time.

01:12:53.221 --> 01:13:06.248
That's interesting because, um, I mean, I don't know like which professionals you're, you're describing, but I mean, there's not, it's not that there isn't racism that goes on in Latin America either.

01:13:06.408 --> 01:13:11.398
It's just a different, it's different than what was experienced historically here.

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:12.380
Right.

01:13:13.082 --> 01:13:13.322
Yeah.

01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:20.208
So there's a different, and I don't know, who knows if maybe they weren't, maybe they didn't experience the racism over there.

01:13:20.228 --> 01:13:26.700
No, I'm not talking about people, somebody who was like from Oaxaca and was like an indigenous family.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.789
You know, I'm talking about Mexicans, you know, immigrants who came here and they were already older.

01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.971
Yeah.

01:13:33.432 --> 01:13:33.812
Yeah.

01:13:35.856 --> 01:13:38.280
Before, I don't really have...

01:13:40.218 --> 01:14:07.086
much else to ask about the mesizaje question but it did out of curiosity um were both of your parents from mexico and then they settled in edinburgh yeah and when when did they or they came they came in the late must have been in the early 50s because my brother was born in 51 okay yeah so they came really early on

01:14:07.505 --> 01:14:19.703
And was it at all, because I know there was a lot of, there was a lot of migration during, you know, the beginning of the Mexican Revolution.

01:14:20.545 --> 01:14:27.155
And then even probably like the 20 years after that, it began that there was a lot of movement.

01:14:27.676 --> 01:14:31.401
And so I was just curious if that was why they came.

01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:32.062
Yeah.

01:14:32.303 --> 01:14:34.626
Well, my, my, my,

01:14:34.792 --> 01:14:39.638
My mother, she had a very conflictive relationship with her mother.

01:14:40.019 --> 01:14:43.743
Her mother was very harsh.

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:51.013
And so she ran away to the border, and that's where she met my dad.

01:14:51.393 --> 01:14:54.377
And my dad was with his mom and his sister.

01:14:55.779 --> 01:15:02.267
And his mom was living with somebody, and he told her, you know, you could stay or you could come.

01:15:02.635 --> 01:15:05.038
And so she chose her son, so she went with him.

01:15:05.879 --> 01:15:07.401
And the story is they met on the border.

01:15:08.402 --> 01:15:09.524
They met crossing the border.

01:15:11.786 --> 01:15:13.789
Yeah.

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:14.930
I don't know what motivated my dad.

01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:18.735
I guess it was right during the Bracero program era.

01:15:18.975 --> 01:15:23.881
So there's probably a lot of recruitment, and that was the thing to do if you didn't have anything.

01:15:23.962 --> 01:15:28.007
And my dad, his dad had left.

01:15:28.027 --> 01:15:29.488
They had separated.

01:15:29.508 --> 01:15:32.372
His dad and his mom had separated, and so he was

01:15:33.365 --> 01:15:34.607
He had grown up just with his mother.

01:15:35.288 --> 01:15:36.109
And so, yeah.

01:15:36.129 --> 01:15:54.013
Well, and then I think I've read numerous accounts of, like, basically, if you were Mexican and you didn't live in Mexico City, then you didn't really have a whole lot of options for work or anything like that.

01:15:54.113 --> 01:16:01.583
So something like the Bracero program would be appealing to a lot of, you know, quote, unquote, rural people.

01:16:01.732 --> 01:16:06.477
He didn't have any land to speak of.

01:16:06.517 --> 01:16:09.080
My grandma worked as a cook.

01:16:15.427 --> 01:16:21.393
Well, is there anything you want to add or save for posterity?

01:16:24.036 --> 01:16:26.078
No, I just wish you well on this project.

01:16:26.118 --> 01:16:28.901
I think she gets some interesting results.

01:16:29.482 --> 01:16:29.882
Yeah.

01:16:30.233 --> 01:16:35.368
I have been getting some interesting things so far.

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:36.651
All right.

01:16:36.712 --> 01:16:38.216
Well, I'm going to end it there.

01:16:39.299 --> 01:16:42.488
Thank you very much.
