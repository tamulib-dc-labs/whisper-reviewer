WEBVTT

00:01.313 --> 00:05.720
Testing, let's see, can you... Testing, testing, one, two, three.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.142
Yeah, that's a good time.

00:07.923 --> 00:11.429
Ready to get closer?

00:11.449 --> 00:11.669
We good?

00:11.689 --> 00:11.889
Maybe.

00:11.909 --> 00:12.931
Maybe, yeah.

00:12.951 --> 00:16.016
Or I can maybe... No, it's okay.

00:16.036 --> 00:16.336
Does that work?

00:16.356 --> 00:16.456
Yeah.

00:16.476 --> 00:16.717
There we go.

00:16.737 --> 00:16.837
Okay.

00:16.857 --> 00:19.842
All right, so today is September 19th.

00:19.982 --> 00:22.986
We're here with Dr. David Hayes-Bautista.

00:24.028 --> 00:29.937
And maybe you could just tell me, well, your name and your age.

00:30.271 --> 00:31.192
I've got my name.

00:31.212 --> 00:33.415
I will be 74 in another three weeks.

00:34.016 --> 00:34.676
Okay.

00:35.818 --> 00:38.721
And then can you tell me, where did you grow up?

00:39.202 --> 00:40.704
Where were you born and raised?

00:41.024 --> 00:42.766
Oh, it's complicated.

00:42.786 --> 00:43.567
I was born here.

00:44.228 --> 00:44.729
In LA?

00:45.109 --> 00:46.911
Actually down in the harbor.

00:46.931 --> 00:47.171
Okay.

00:47.191 --> 00:48.213
San Pedro.

00:48.233 --> 00:50.636
Because my dad was in the Navy.

00:50.656 --> 00:51.697
Then I was raised here.

00:51.837 --> 00:52.898
We were raised there.

00:53.319 --> 00:54.140
I don't remember that.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.041
I was too young.

00:55.742 --> 00:57.544
City Terrace, El Monte.

00:59.110 --> 01:05.477
Then when I was seven, my family left LA, my immediate family.

01:05.497 --> 01:06.758
I have extended family.

01:06.918 --> 01:09.581
We've been here about 130 years ago.

01:09.601 --> 01:17.068
Got a lot of family, but then just for his work, we moved to San Luis Obispo.

01:17.088 --> 01:27.379
Actually, we lived outside of San Luis Obispo by Morro Bay, but outside of Morro Bay in a little tiny town called Baywood Park, where we wound up going for,

01:27.730 --> 01:30.573
to probably one of the last one-room schools in California.

01:31.613 --> 01:35.577
There were six grades, eight students, one teacher.

01:35.597 --> 01:39.841
I was the third grade kid.

01:39.861 --> 01:41.402
Then we were there for a couple of years.

01:42.724 --> 01:47.067
And then my dad was a highway engineer, so this is when they were building the highway systems out.

01:47.768 --> 01:51.071
He got assigned to work on Interstate 80 going over the summit.

01:51.952 --> 01:57.737
So we moved up to a little tiny town 40 miles north of Sacramento when I was 10 called Yuba City.

01:58.156 --> 02:04.005
And it was inhabited by an ethnic group that has since disappeared.

02:05.187 --> 02:05.528
Okies.

02:06.429 --> 02:07.611
Real life Okies.

02:07.631 --> 02:10.576
Still coming out of Oklahoma in 1955.

02:10.636 --> 02:13.501
And of course, this isn't like East L.A.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.965
And I went to Culture Shock, quite frankly.

02:16.405 --> 02:16.506
Yeah.

02:17.006 --> 02:20.913
Then, you know, I was only there for seven years.

02:21.013 --> 02:22.175
Fifth grade through high school.

02:23.196 --> 02:24.298
But it marked me for life.

02:25.088 --> 02:34.999
Um, and of course then we come back, spend every summer here in LA and you still, I see very different from Oakeyuba city.

02:35.019 --> 02:35.620
Very different.

02:36.641 --> 02:38.683
So is this like early sixties?

02:38.904 --> 02:39.304
Fifties.

02:39.704 --> 02:40.105
Oh, okay.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.948
Late fifties, mid fifties, mid to late fifties.

02:42.968 --> 02:45.070
We left, we left LA in 1952.

02:45.511 --> 02:48.835
So I would spend usually summers here.

02:48.855 --> 02:51.838
So I watched LA grow sort of in stop action.

02:52.460 --> 02:55.163
And then seeing the family in stop action, you know, once a year.

02:56.384 --> 02:57.165
Yeah.

02:57.185 --> 03:00.849
Then when I graduated from high school, I couldn't wait to leave Yuba City.

03:00.929 --> 03:05.975
So I went off to college and did my first two years at Davis.

03:06.916 --> 03:11.821
At that point, there were two African-Americans in my class, about a half dozen Asians.

03:11.881 --> 03:14.624
As far as I could tell, one Chicano, that was me.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.548
Then I heard there were 25 Chicanos at Berkeley.

03:17.908 --> 03:18.809
So I went down to check it out.

03:18.889 --> 03:20.811
Sure enough, there were 25 Chicanos at Berkeley.

03:20.831 --> 03:21.572
So I transferred.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.261
felt like I died and went to heaven.

03:24.202 --> 03:26.805
So I was a Berkeley during the third world strike and all that stuff.

03:27.846 --> 03:30.108
I got involved in setting up La ClÃ­nica de la Raza.

03:30.228 --> 03:38.597
Then I went off to UCSF where we were the first entering class at the medical center and been having fun.

03:38.617 --> 03:41.840
And then 30 years ago, UCLA made me an offer.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.661
I couldn't refuse.

03:43.582 --> 03:45.203
I thought it was time to come back home.

03:45.224 --> 03:48.707
So I'm back home and now

03:49.160 --> 03:52.264
My last older aunt just died earlier this year.

03:53.766 --> 03:56.870
So now we are officially the old farts, just me and my cousins.

03:57.391 --> 03:57.811
Wow.

03:58.913 --> 03:59.273
Yeah.

03:59.354 --> 04:05.261
So, um, how would you, that's interesting.

04:05.281 --> 04:08.325
I didn't know you were at Berkeley during that time period.

04:08.606 --> 04:09.988
Then I was on the faculty at Berkeley.

04:10.428 --> 04:14.774
I finished at UCSF in the basic sciences and I was shanghied onto the faculty in 1974.

04:14.894 --> 04:18.559
I went through the series from assistant to full professor.

04:18.961 --> 04:19.802
Mm-hmm.

04:19.822 --> 04:21.785
And then UCLA came to calling.

04:22.106 --> 04:22.446
Right.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.290
So I lived in Berkeley for damn near 20 years.

04:25.811 --> 04:26.031
Uh-huh.

04:26.051 --> 04:27.253
My kids were born in Berkeley.

04:27.974 --> 04:40.412
Would you say that, um, well, I guess maybe I should ask first, um, how you saw yourself or if you saw yourself as a participant of the Chicano movement?

04:40.432 --> 04:44.118
I'm going to assume yes.

04:44.138 --> 04:45.680
From the early days.

04:45.700 --> 04:45.840
Yeah.

04:46.060 --> 04:47.803
And was that, um,

04:48.340 --> 04:55.568
Was that mostly from your interactions at Berkeley or prior to that?

04:55.748 --> 05:00.514
Well, I mean, we could spend the whole hour just talking on early childhood experiences.

05:00.574 --> 05:11.606
One of the side effects of spending 11 months out of the year in Yuba City and one month back in East L.A.

05:11.707 --> 05:15.050
is I really understood, wow, these are two really different worlds.

05:16.512 --> 05:17.453
No question about it.

05:17.838 --> 05:24.986
And, of course, back then, presidential segregation was still on.

05:25.006 --> 05:32.495
My uncle, Uncle Walt, in fact, tried to buy a house about 1952 or 53 up in San Fernando Valley.

05:32.515 --> 05:33.316
They were just building it.

05:33.656 --> 05:36.399
He actually had to have a white guy buy it for him.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.901
Oh, man.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.503
Because he couldn't buy it.

05:40.464 --> 05:40.644
Yeah.

05:40.785 --> 05:43.708
You know, that was still in force.

05:43.728 --> 05:43.828
Yeah.

05:44.737 --> 05:49.862
My parents were cautioned never to teach us Spanish, because we're already stupid enough, and of course that would make us even stupider.

05:49.902 --> 05:55.028
In fact, I was categorized as mentally retarded at Cogswell Elementary School, which is still there in El Mahdi.

05:56.529 --> 05:58.551
So that's, yeah, you grow up in that.

05:58.571 --> 05:59.652
Yeah.

05:59.673 --> 06:09.583
And then particularly up in Yuba City, Oklahomans are Southerners, and they have just all the racial attitudes of the South, just everyday, casually, viciously racist.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.564
It was just the way it was.

06:12.286 --> 06:14.608
And what years were you at Berkeley?

06:15.179 --> 06:38.402
um that would have been like mid 60s yeah i got there in 1967 and graduated in 70 and i lived there while i went to ucsf and i set up la clinica de la raza 1970 in oakland and stayed there until 1987 i guess 20 years got married had my kids yeah got tenure did the whole thing

06:40.087 --> 07:02.668
um I was talking with um Armando Rendon for this project and he was telling me about how he had um I think he said he moved from because he's also from the Berkeley area and that he had taken a job in Sacramento

07:03.121 --> 07:28.234
as a journalist and that what really kind of drew him into the Chicano movement and and you know documenting it and stuff was um his he had an assignment to go check out Cesar Chavez and the march and so I was just curious because I know there's a lot of farm working in that area too Yuba City

07:28.535 --> 07:31.018
Sacramento, what's the other little town there?

07:31.039 --> 07:34.123
I had the other working with the last crews of Braceros in 1963.

07:34.143 --> 07:34.443
Yeah.

07:34.744 --> 07:36.386
I mean, I didn't know it was going to be the last year.

07:36.446 --> 07:38.809
It was just, it's what you did for summer money.

07:39.110 --> 07:39.330
Right.

07:39.350 --> 07:40.812
Everybody worked out in the farms in the summer.

07:41.834 --> 07:47.842
And so I was sort of the capataza de Braceros because I could speak a little Spanish.

07:47.862 --> 07:52.489
Not very good Spanish, but you know, mas caja sort of thing, you know, quieres agua sort of stuff.

07:54.171 --> 07:57.816
Didn't realize at the time, but yeah, that was back when

07:58.825 --> 08:06.516
You know, there was no radio in Spanish except for one program from 5.30 to 6, the one station to play 30 minutes of Mexican music.

08:07.618 --> 08:16.050
The theaters were segregated, but the, I believe it was the state theater in Marysville on Saturdays at midnight would show one Mexican movie.

08:16.070 --> 08:18.915
All the braceros would go there.

08:18.935 --> 08:20.277
That's what I grew up in.

08:20.297 --> 08:20.617
Yeah.

08:21.599 --> 08:25.064
So, excuse me.

08:25.084 --> 08:27.988
So do you think it was just kind of like,

08:28.255 --> 08:37.187
Living that experience of, you know, being segregated from the rest of the community, being, you know.

08:37.207 --> 08:41.753
Well, see, the thing is in L.A., at least when you're a little kid, I didn't realize we were segregated.

08:41.773 --> 08:43.015
It was just everybody's here.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.399
Aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins by the score.

08:46.439 --> 08:48.682
I'm just, it's kind of what was.

08:49.844 --> 08:49.964
Right.

08:49.984 --> 08:53.108
You look back and you say, oh, yeah, we were probably segregated.

08:53.128 --> 08:56.553
At the time, everybody was there.

08:56.573 --> 08:56.954
Yeah.

08:56.994 --> 08:57.334
So it didn't.

08:57.989 --> 09:01.132
But going out to Yuba City, that was, whoa.

09:01.152 --> 09:01.493
Yeah.

09:02.114 --> 09:08.981
And I think, like, my question is a little more about what was it about that experience?

09:09.842 --> 09:18.652
Because, I mean, obviously, you know, you or anybody who's participated in the Chicano Movement, they're not the only ones that are experiencing that.

09:18.692 --> 09:23.377
But some people became active and other people didn't.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.139
And so I guess I'm trying to get out.

09:25.539 --> 09:26.140
Actually, I'm.

09:26.575 --> 09:28.418
I'm not so sure I'd say it just like that.

09:28.498 --> 09:28.959
Sure.

09:28.979 --> 09:32.645
In fact, I did my dissertation at UCSF.

09:32.665 --> 09:34.768
I was in the basic sciences.

09:34.788 --> 09:53.038
I was originally going to do it on Latino patient behavior because at that point I had found my voice, so to speak, and I was very upset with the way Latinos being dealt with as a research topic.

09:53.474 --> 09:57.140
We're always passive, fatalistic, superstitious, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.543
And here we were setting up a clinic.

09:59.643 --> 10:02.147
Hello, passive, fatalistic, superstitious.

10:02.167 --> 10:02.328
Yeah.

10:02.348 --> 10:03.009
Taking power.

10:03.990 --> 10:11.081
And in fact, when I was an undergraduate, I read this one book written by an anthropologist, Margaret Clark.

10:11.101 --> 10:13.124
And it's called Health in the Mexican-American Culture.

10:13.144 --> 10:14.186
You can still buy it.

10:14.226 --> 10:15.027
Margaret Clark.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.130
Clark.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.916
And I remember when I was an undergrad, when I read it,

10:22.583 --> 10:23.604
I had two emotions.

10:23.624 --> 10:28.768
The first was, wow, I'd never seen a book written about us.

10:28.788 --> 10:30.210
So I want to read this.

10:31.431 --> 10:47.245
Then as I read it, I got increasingly disappointed because she was depicting Latinos as this passive, fatalistic, folkloric, blah, blah, blah, believes in herbs, curanderos, would rather see them than go to a physician.

10:47.705 --> 10:50.167
And at the end, I hated the book.

10:50.187 --> 10:51.088
And I remember thinking,

10:51.322 --> 10:57.948
Well, actually she described what my mom would do, but only one part.

10:57.968 --> 10:59.109
She didn't describe the rest.

10:59.129 --> 11:01.892
Like we were early in the polio vaccine trials.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.193
We were still living here in LA.

11:04.775 --> 11:06.196
I had braces on my teeth.

11:06.236 --> 11:11.181
I mean, like that never happened to Mark because she was really interested in this exotic stuff.

11:11.201 --> 11:11.561
Right.

11:14.264 --> 11:19.329
And that's what most people at that point thought, well, Latinos don't go to the doctor because they'd rather go to a curandero.

11:19.489 --> 11:20.670
So we don't need to do anything.

11:21.325 --> 11:26.312
Well, we set up La Clinica because they weren't doing anything, but not because people would rather go to a curandero.

11:27.033 --> 11:31.399
I put her on my PhD committee because I wanted to argue her into the ground and I did.

11:32.581 --> 11:44.298
And I do that to this day because they're still, they have this narrative about what Latinos and Mexicans are supposed to be like that is so strong they don't even bother to look at the data, which contradicts what they think.

11:44.979 --> 11:50.307
And then they bring those attitudes into the research lab and then they try to replicate them.

11:50.327 --> 11:50.607
Yeah.

11:50.823 --> 11:54.747
So that's, you know, I just got pissed off from a very early age on that.

11:55.528 --> 12:02.194
That's very reminiscent of, I'm not sure if you're familiar with Octavio Romano's work.

12:02.334 --> 12:03.095
I knew Octavio.

12:03.255 --> 12:04.036
Yeah.

12:04.056 --> 12:14.487
And there's a really like famous essay that he wrote in El Grito about that very thing, right?

12:14.507 --> 12:15.788
I think I have a copy of it.

12:15.808 --> 12:17.790
Yeah, socio-anthropological.

12:17.810 --> 12:17.910
Yeah.

12:18.262 --> 12:22.709
But here's where he and I saw things differently because he wrote and he complained.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.474
I wrote and we did something.

12:26.135 --> 12:27.056
We set up La Clinica.

12:27.677 --> 12:29.460
We set up Bay Area Drastic Coalition for Health.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.383
We set up National Chicano Health Organization.

12:31.784 --> 12:37.854
We took on the most entrenched, racist, white, male-dominated profession there is in the United States, the medical profession.

12:38.254 --> 12:38.495
Yeah.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.478
And we're still taking them on.

12:40.498 --> 12:41.580
Yeah.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.902
You know, Octavia sat around and

12:43.625 --> 13:12.366
pontificated pardon my but he never did anything well what about what about his the journals okay I'll give him a little bit well he was look he was a Chilango upper class and he had all the typical attitude I still see a Chilango upper class towards Chicanos he was kind of slumming but to me at least it was clear he was slumming

13:12.633 --> 13:17.939
And in fact, we wound up being in the same school as a faculty.

13:17.959 --> 13:20.642
And that's when we... Is that Berkeley?

13:20.962 --> 13:21.483
Yeah, Berkeley.

13:21.663 --> 13:24.226
He was, I think, a medical anthropologist, was he not?

13:25.066 --> 13:26.047
Anthropology.

13:26.067 --> 13:28.991
Yeah, he was studying, I believe, one of his articles, The Hero of Los Olmos.

13:29.011 --> 13:31.894
So he's back into this curandero folkloric and everything else.

13:31.974 --> 13:39.662
And you're dealing with medical school admissions, retention, clinic finance, policy, licensure, and you're dealing with curanderos?

13:40.323 --> 13:40.463
Mm-hmm.

13:42.704 --> 14:11.648
all right um so it sounds like to me if somebody was to say oh dr hayes bautista was a participant in the chicano movement would you agree that it was in this form of actually putting together you know taking that i don't want to say rage when you read

14:11.898 --> 14:13.079
It's more than rage.

14:13.099 --> 14:14.000
Clark's book.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.101
She gave me rage, yeah.

14:15.121 --> 14:15.521
Yeah.

14:15.541 --> 14:19.304
After an initial euphoria thinking, wow, I've never read a book about us.

14:19.324 --> 14:38.020
Yeah, but would you say that that work that you've been doing, right, the work that you continue to do in studying Latinos and health and stuff like that, that that is maybe your contribution to the movement and continuing that?

14:39.321 --> 14:40.722
Certainly a piece of it.

14:40.742 --> 14:41.483
Certainly a piece.

14:41.969 --> 14:53.078
The reason why we just finished writing this book on the Chicano Health Movement is that my cohort set up close to 500 clinics in the 70s and the 80s.

14:54.339 --> 14:55.040
They've grown up.

14:56.241 --> 15:00.925
La Clinica is one of the major health care providers in Alameda Contra Costa counties.

15:01.005 --> 15:02.426
I think they have about 30 sites.

15:03.067 --> 15:07.731
Altamed used to be Clinica Libre del Barrio has grown up, now has over 60 sites.

15:07.751 --> 15:11.554
I believe Altamed enrolled more people in

15:12.293 --> 15:16.599
Obamacare than any other institution in California in La Clinica was number two.

15:19.223 --> 15:23.549
We're celebrating our 50th anniversary, and nobody talks about us in Chicano studies.

15:23.950 --> 15:24.631
Yeah.

15:24.651 --> 15:33.343
The typical Chicano studies history is you had the brown braids, you had the walkouts, you had the moratorium, you had the crusade for justice.

15:33.363 --> 15:36.428
Then in 1974, Casa got infiltrated, blew up, and it was all over.

15:36.949 --> 15:37.049
Yeah.

15:37.069 --> 15:37.529
End of story.

15:38.531 --> 15:40.374
They're thinking, well, that's a pretty short story.

15:40.434 --> 15:41.355
How come we're still around?

15:41.690 --> 15:47.218
So that's why we interviewed 183 veterinarians, our story over 50 years.

15:47.238 --> 15:47.819
We're still here.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.723
And we changed healthcare policy in this state.

15:52.625 --> 15:55.129
Yeah, that is very true.

15:55.630 --> 16:00.376
So I'm glad I'm getting that and it will go in my... I'll send you a copy of the book.

16:00.396 --> 16:00.977
It's going to come out.

16:00.997 --> 16:05.263
It's going to be released November 7th at Altamed's 50th anniversary.

16:05.283 --> 16:05.964
All right.

16:05.984 --> 16:06.625
And we're still here.

16:07.386 --> 16:09.329
And new generations constantly moving in.

16:09.830 --> 16:10.110
Yeah.

16:10.580 --> 16:16.286
So for 50 years, we've been doing everything we said we were going to do in the sixties and we did it.

16:16.306 --> 16:16.986
We're still doing it.

16:17.006 --> 16:20.170
We're taking on the UC medical school system right now.

16:20.190 --> 16:28.198
Why do you think that is the year that your project is continuing and a lot of other projects?

16:28.418 --> 16:30.039
That's why we wrote this book.

16:30.340 --> 16:30.700
Oh, okay.

16:30.720 --> 16:38.368
To try to figure this out and interviewed actually whole generation, not only our generation, actually there were sort of three generations involved.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.570
There was the Chicano boom generation.

16:41.107 --> 16:42.068
Is that your generation?

16:42.088 --> 16:42.950
Yes, my generation.

16:43.230 --> 16:46.635
And Castelo de la Rocha and Joel Garcia and Jane Garcia and everybody else.

16:47.996 --> 16:48.097
Yeah.

16:48.117 --> 16:48.577
Thank you.

16:48.597 --> 16:50.019
I might be a little full.

16:50.340 --> 16:50.900
That's okay.

16:51.041 --> 16:56.448
As long as it's got caffeine, that's the main thing.

16:56.468 --> 17:01.395
Then there was, and that went from about 1965 about 1985.

17:01.555 --> 17:07.603
Then there was a subsequent generation that as they were just

17:08.225 --> 17:10.707
finishing up medical school and coming out and doing things 187.

17:10.987 --> 17:13.009
So they're the 187 generation.

17:14.290 --> 17:22.137
Now we got this current generation that has just been whiplashed between Obama and Trump, the hope of Obama and the reality of Trump.

17:23.258 --> 17:23.618
Yep.

17:23.638 --> 17:25.099
Us old veteranos are still around.

17:26.100 --> 17:34.367
Uh, we had a, uh, training session for mentors because we're trying to increase Latino enrollment still in medical school 50 years later.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.810
And we sat in and filled his office in 1970 when he was

17:38.144 --> 17:40.727
the liberal chancellor from the East Coast, from the Kennedys.

17:41.288 --> 17:44.572
We sat in his office, he hated us, hated me.

17:44.592 --> 17:49.958
Then two years later, he gave me the chancellor's award.

17:49.978 --> 17:56.766
And don't worry, about in the 19, about 1995, I was asked to review his grant.

18:01.452 --> 18:03.915
So yeah, part of it is we're trying to understand, well,

18:04.537 --> 18:06.939
How come everybody else says the Chicano movement ended in 1974?

18:07.500 --> 18:08.601
And we were just getting going.

18:08.661 --> 18:11.704
We've been going for, and it's been now three generations.

18:11.724 --> 18:11.864
Yeah.

18:12.304 --> 18:14.146
And I keep people here.

18:14.166 --> 18:18.350
I hear people saying, in fact, I was just reading Mario Barrera's book.

18:18.370 --> 18:19.831
I happen to be having lunch out there.

18:20.151 --> 18:21.713
His Beyond Astlan book.

18:21.773 --> 18:23.855
He's basically saying, game over.

18:23.875 --> 18:24.996
We're all assimilating.

18:25.016 --> 18:25.856
No more activism.

18:25.956 --> 18:26.297
It's all over.

18:26.317 --> 18:27.037
We're going to disappear.

18:27.258 --> 18:27.778
Yeah.

18:27.818 --> 18:33.143
Same year I wrote my first book in which I projected that by 2030, California would be 40.

18:33.359 --> 18:34.882
2.5% Latino.

18:35.062 --> 18:36.445
And what would it mean?

18:36.465 --> 18:39.451
It hit every decennial census on the book, right on the nose.

18:40.272 --> 18:42.196
You can still buy the book that's published by Stanford.

18:43.138 --> 18:44.020
The Burden of Support.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.925
I just saw things differently from Mario.

18:46.945 --> 18:51.734
We were involved in building things, taking care of people's health, changing policy.

18:52.075 --> 18:52.396
Yeah.

18:53.478 --> 18:55.722
Do you think that is...

18:56.731 --> 19:02.958
a difference in, well, I mean, I know you said you talk about it in the book, but maybe you can.

19:02.978 --> 19:04.840
Well, I don't mind sharing.

19:04.961 --> 19:09.005
We're going to do other books out of this nice, wonderful data set.

19:09.025 --> 19:21.099
You know, what were the things, when we go back to early childhood experiences, how did we, how did individually, because each one, every one of us has a different story, yet there are some similarities all the way through.

19:21.139 --> 19:21.760
Mm-hmm.

19:22.364 --> 19:26.689
that kept us going for 50 years when other people said, well, it was over in 1974.

19:28.511 --> 19:29.752
And healthcare is different.

19:29.772 --> 19:31.254
I mean, we have responsibilities.

19:31.774 --> 19:32.095
Yeah.

19:32.115 --> 19:33.977
We have people's lives in our hands.

19:33.997 --> 19:34.618
Right.

19:34.638 --> 19:35.919
The quality has got to be good.

19:35.939 --> 19:38.382
It's not like setting up just a parade or a manifestation.

19:38.822 --> 19:39.143
Yeah.

19:39.163 --> 19:40.364
This is every day.

19:40.384 --> 19:40.524
Yeah.

19:40.544 --> 19:52.017
And that's what I was going to kind of ask is whether the kind of the foundation or foundational principles is that you're dealing with like,

19:52.874 --> 20:22.358
people's material lives and and their bodies and you know and stuff like that rather than this more kind of like ephemeral identity um culture type of i mean it's all part of that but do you get what i'm saying or no well yeah and actually what we point out in this book is that in many ways we adam braided obamacare 50 years before obamacare

20:22.692 --> 20:24.774
We said, why not?

20:24.834 --> 20:26.697
Healthcare is a right.

20:28.178 --> 20:33.264
In fact, our goal, when we set up La Clinica, I remember we said 1970, here's our goal.

20:33.284 --> 20:36.448
We're going to bring services where none exist.

20:36.468 --> 20:37.729
We're going to bring them in Spanish.

20:38.430 --> 20:40.392
We're going to bring them for free.

20:41.433 --> 20:42.395
We have $240.

20:43.055 --> 20:45.538
Let's roll up our sleeves and get going.

20:45.558 --> 20:48.662
And by the way, we refused federal funding.

20:48.682 --> 20:49.943
It was days of war and party.

20:49.963 --> 20:51.345
We saw it just totally corrupting.

20:51.385 --> 20:52.446
So it happened in Oakland.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.490
So we refused federal funding.

20:54.510 --> 20:55.991
We did it the hard way.

20:56.191 --> 21:00.295
And maybe because of that, LaClinica is there and grown tremendously.

21:00.895 --> 21:02.617
We took no shortcuts.

21:02.657 --> 21:05.719
We believed that patients should run these clinics.

21:05.979 --> 21:08.942
So the majority of the boards of directors had to be patients.

21:09.482 --> 21:15.648
We believed in empowerment, that health included income, education.

21:15.688 --> 21:17.469
They're now called social determinants of health.

21:18.670 --> 21:21.893
Our goal was to have healthy, empowered patients

21:22.463 --> 21:27.788
living with healthy, empowered families in healthy, empowered communities.

21:27.809 --> 21:32.353
So voter registration, all this stuff that was built in, that's how we deliver care.

21:33.134 --> 21:34.075
And what was it?

21:34.175 --> 21:37.999
I mean, like I said earlier, I'm doing, I'm in philosophy.

21:38.780 --> 21:47.749
So this is all really interesting to me because now I want to know like, well, what informed those positions to have that mission, you know what I mean?

21:47.769 --> 21:48.690
You know, many people,

21:49.565 --> 21:51.687
have seen the Chicano, it was kind of a me too.

21:51.707 --> 21:57.654
Well, first was the civil rights movement, then the women's, then gay and American, then oh, me too, here comes the Chicanos.

21:57.674 --> 22:01.138
Well, they weren't rearing, and they were over by 74, so blah, blah, blah, blah.

22:01.158 --> 22:03.641
That's not what we see in these interviews.

22:03.661 --> 22:14.793
What we see are sort of the independent roots of the Chicano movement that in many ways I would say it would have happened even if there hadn't been civil rights, because we have our own roots and we tend not to recognize.

22:16.054 --> 22:18.357
The roots of the Chicano health movement came out of

22:19.248 --> 22:37.192
liberation theology out of South America, the pedagogy of the oppressed, and then the three wonderful weeks in 1960 when Fidel Castro strode into liberated Cuba and Vatican II was convened and we just felt, wow, we can do anything.

22:38.114 --> 22:40.296
And that was not part of the civil rights or women's or anybody else.

22:40.316 --> 22:40.977
That was our.

22:41.698 --> 22:41.819
Right.

22:41.979 --> 22:48.107
This is what, and our veteranos mentioned those over and over and over and how important they were

22:48.813 --> 22:52.518
We firmly believed la cultura cura.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.181
Whereas Margaret Clark saw our culture as being backwards and holding.

22:55.201 --> 22:56.983
We thought, no, that's the answer.

22:57.064 --> 22:57.684
We need more of it.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.408
And that was our motto, la cultura cura.

23:00.968 --> 23:16.288
So it sounds like, and especially going back to your participation with Third World Liberation, that a lot of this is kind of coming out of this anti-colonial movement of the 50s, like post-World War II.

23:16.437 --> 23:41.331
anti-colonialism that you're seeing worldwide yeah but our particular branch was liberation theology was anti-colonialism pedagogy paulo freder is anti-colonialism clearly the cuban revolution for about 10 years was a bright shining possibility and then uh vatican ii did its thing etc um so it that was our brand of it that was our that's what formed us yeah

23:42.442 --> 23:50.290
I find that really interesting too because I can't remember the name of the group.

23:52.593 --> 24:07.268
I think it's from like the Bandung conference that they came up with kind of like a list of principles or values that these nations or states had kind of adopted.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.780
So that's interesting.

24:10.862 --> 24:15.128
Maybe since I think we're, I don't know what time it is exactly.

24:15.148 --> 24:15.929
3.30.

24:15.949 --> 24:16.250
3.30.

24:17.091 --> 24:17.491
Okay.

24:17.652 --> 24:26.765
So maybe we can switch to the other topic, unless you have anything else you want to add about this period.

24:26.785 --> 24:27.706
It was fascinating.

24:28.828 --> 24:34.977
And I saw some dynamics that we still see today.

24:35.513 --> 24:38.437
Just the issue of, well, okay, well, who is Chicano?

24:38.978 --> 24:42.063
Oh, I was starting to tell you this, my dissertation.

24:42.103 --> 24:46.970
I was originally, actually I got my first NIH grant to study Latino patient behavior.

24:47.031 --> 24:57.867
And I did eventually offer an alternative model to Margaret Clark's by the simple act of giving Latino patients their agency.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.049
How did they experience it?

24:59.189 --> 25:03.075
How did they put it together?

25:03.095 --> 25:04.457
Even though I was told by my dean,

25:04.825 --> 25:11.234
Warren Winklestein, the day I was hired not to study Chicano Health, because I'd never get published.

25:11.254 --> 25:12.015
I wouldn't get tenure.

25:12.395 --> 25:13.437
Yeah.

25:13.457 --> 25:14.037
I said, bullshit.

25:14.057 --> 25:15.239
By then, I found my voice.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.563
That's all I did, and I got accelerated tenure.

25:18.583 --> 25:29.899
I got tenure and four years in a biomedical field studying Latino patient behavior, but giving them their agency instead of presuming their passive, fatalistic, superstitious, can't defer gratification, all that crap.

25:30.439 --> 25:30.900
Right.

25:31.260 --> 25:34.605
And the papers I did actually are good 50 years later.

25:34.625 --> 25:34.765
Mm-hmm.

25:35.369 --> 25:37.752
Yeah.

25:37.772 --> 25:44.120
But because I was involved setting up, we set up the National Chicano Health Organization in 1970.

25:45.822 --> 25:47.524
And it was primarily in the Southwest.

25:48.885 --> 25:56.995
And our goals were increased medical school recruitment, admissions, retention, financial aid.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.136
I mean, the hardcore stuff.

25:59.758 --> 26:02.001
And so it was my job.

26:03.027 --> 26:09.294
So I'd go to medical school, say at San Antonio, and we'd start organizing students.

26:09.334 --> 26:14.000
I'd meet with the students and ask everybody on admissions, retention, financial aid, et cetera.

26:14.020 --> 26:15.282
Then we'd go out and have beer at night.

26:17.064 --> 26:20.167
And after about the fourth or fifth beer, I started getting these stories.

26:20.668 --> 26:22.110
But am I really Chicano?

26:24.633 --> 26:25.854
I graduated from high school.

26:25.874 --> 26:27.736
My parents aren't farm workers.

26:27.776 --> 26:31.701
Nobody in my family is in prison.

26:31.917 --> 26:35.941
And who am I to say, yes, you are, you aren't, but I'd just, I'd be an ear.

26:36.621 --> 26:42.206
But I kept getting all these stories of different backgrounds.

26:42.226 --> 26:47.591
And this was the day of what I call the two-minute Chicano, where a true Chicano was like this.

26:47.611 --> 26:54.117
And particularly from the more ideological perspectives, you have to be from the proper class, have the right class consciousness, then you're a Chicano.

26:54.137 --> 27:00.203
If you didn't, in fact, I remember when I first came to UCLA in 1987, a

27:00.385 --> 27:02.668
Chicano faculty person took me to one side.

27:02.708 --> 27:08.775
And this is back when we actually used to have decent Latino enrollments here before they got rid of affirmative action.

27:08.795 --> 27:12.359
So there are about 3,000 Latino students on campus.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.342
So I said, well, it's nice to be here.

27:15.362 --> 27:17.965
You've got a lot of Chicanos to do something like Berkeley.

27:17.985 --> 27:19.687
Only 20 are real Chicanos.

27:20.228 --> 27:20.648
What are they?

27:20.949 --> 27:22.451
Oh, they're not really Chicanos.

27:22.471 --> 27:24.753
They look around, but they don't have the right consciousness.

27:24.793 --> 27:28.477
Well, what he meant is they didn't share his particular ideological perspective.

27:28.638 --> 27:28.958
Yeah.

27:29.478 --> 27:34.585
I saw a lot of that up at Berkeley early on, who is Chicano, and everybody, well, you are, you are, you are, you are.

27:35.767 --> 27:41.415
As one of the medical students said this, playing these games, all that sort of business.

27:41.895 --> 27:50.467
But then, this is up in the Bay Area, and as an undergraduate, my roommate was a Nicaraguanse, so I got to know the Central American community very well in the mission of the 60s.

27:52.030 --> 27:54.092
And they're not Mexican, quite and large.

27:55.074 --> 27:58.118
Now I know that's a holdover from the gold rush.

27:58.790 --> 28:04.716
Um, but then seeing the, during the third world strike at Berkeley and then people come over from the mission, but they weren't Mexican.

28:04.796 --> 28:07.920
They were Central American, Salvador and Guatemalan.

28:07.940 --> 28:12.324
And I remember after the Chicago study department was set up at Berkeley, they couldn't find a chair.

28:13.225 --> 28:20.633
So, um, it was Osvaldo Asturias, who has a San Francisco State, agreed to come over and be the chair.

28:21.694 --> 28:22.435
And some of the more

28:22.617 --> 28:24.138
Real Chicano students took his head off.

28:24.158 --> 28:25.119
He was bourgeois.

28:25.580 --> 28:26.300
He wasn't Mexican.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.001
He's Guatemalan.

28:27.021 --> 28:27.922
He wrote poetry.

28:27.942 --> 28:28.903
He lived in a big house.

28:29.203 --> 28:31.485
And he only lasted one year they took his head off.

28:31.505 --> 28:32.526
So I remember those days.

28:34.568 --> 28:35.609
That was as an undergraduate.

28:35.669 --> 28:38.231
Then here I'm going around the southwest.

28:38.271 --> 28:41.193
I'm in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and hearing these anguished stories.

28:41.213 --> 28:42.395
I don't know what Chicano is.

28:43.135 --> 28:45.597
People, sometimes they think I am, and they just tell me I'm not.

28:45.657 --> 28:46.598
So what am I doing?

28:47.419 --> 28:50.802
Plus, medical school is really different.

28:50.822 --> 28:51.983
Very heavy.

28:52.553 --> 28:54.616
professional socialization.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.540
So I thought, hey, this is pretty damn interesting.

28:58.141 --> 29:09.457
So I actually did my dissertation on the first cohort of Chicano medical students, dealing with this dual, very heavy, on one hand, a professional associate, you are a physician.

29:09.737 --> 29:11.420
Of course, everything is totally white.

29:12.261 --> 29:14.204
On the other hand, grappling with their identity.

29:14.284 --> 29:15.385
Who am I?

29:15.405 --> 29:16.567
What am I going to do when I get out?

29:16.627 --> 29:18.229
Where am I going to practice and everything else?

29:19.672 --> 29:22.155
So I did my dissertation actually on that topic.

29:22.422 --> 29:22.843
Uh-huh.

29:23.624 --> 29:33.538
And then you snuck in to gather those people and make it part of your, like, was that a gap that you were like, I'm going to get in there?

29:33.558 --> 29:34.379
No, I was out there.

29:34.399 --> 29:35.921
I was organizing the medical students.

29:36.242 --> 29:36.382
Yeah.

29:36.422 --> 29:39.567
Different chapters of the National Chicano Health Organization.

29:39.587 --> 29:43.913
Like I say, this is at night after we had done the heavy organizing and formed committees and everything else.

29:43.933 --> 29:45.295
We were just having dinner.

29:45.315 --> 29:46.777
And then people just started opening up.

29:47.578 --> 29:52.345
And I think because I was an outsider, they felt maybe safe sharing

29:52.797 --> 29:54.399
their insecurities with me.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.384
And who am I to say yes or not?

29:57.444 --> 29:58.686
I just heard them.

29:58.706 --> 29:59.006
Yeah.

29:59.086 --> 30:00.368
I just read a lot of you.

30:00.388 --> 30:01.590
A lot of varieties.

30:01.610 --> 30:02.611
Yeah.

30:02.631 --> 30:03.433
Interesting.

30:03.573 --> 30:09.361
So you got the class, the ethnicity, Mexican versus non-Mexican, you name it.

30:10.483 --> 30:12.846
Do Brazilians count that sort of stuff?

30:12.866 --> 30:13.247
Yeah.

30:13.267 --> 30:19.917
And I, I think that's actually interesting and a good way to kind of segue into the Messisa stuff.

30:20.598 --> 30:22.180
Because, um,

30:22.480 --> 30:24.823
Yeah, you hear a lot of that even today, right?

30:25.283 --> 30:34.494
And you see it with like different groups, school groups and stuff, or even just a lot in like academia.

30:34.514 --> 30:48.371
I don't see it a lot outside of academia, but, you know, like, oh, we're not Chicano, we're Chicanx, or we don't want to be affiliated with that term Chicano anymore, or Aslan, right?

30:49.212 --> 30:50.293
And...

30:50.915 --> 30:56.041
And I, you know, I think about, like, why is that happening right now?

30:56.842 --> 31:09.617
Is it because, like, we just haven't, like, people who consider themselves to be Chicano, is it that they haven't educated, right?

31:09.638 --> 31:11.720
They haven't, like, spread that message?

31:12.641 --> 31:17.547
Or is it because there's just a whole, like, you know, is there a...

31:18.978 --> 31:26.048
A learning gap, not a learning gap, but just, you know, the message is not being shared.

31:27.890 --> 31:31.415
I'm a demographer, primarily.

31:31.435 --> 31:34.520
Like I said, I wrote my first book, Going Forward.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.584
I wrote it, started writing in 1982, going out to 2030.

31:37.644 --> 31:48.259
Then I wrote my second book as a result of Prop 187, People Saying Things About Latinos.

31:49.150 --> 31:50.952
looking really what are Latinos like.

31:51.873 --> 31:55.717
And I use census data primarily from 1940 to 2000.

31:59.661 --> 32:11.874
About 15 years ago, to do the medical research, I really needed to understand what is Latino, what is Mexicano, what is Hispanic.

32:12.594 --> 32:18.921
And I had written on it in the 80s, but without a historical, not a deep historical context.

32:20.572 --> 32:24.596
So I've become an historian, a demographic historian.

32:24.616 --> 32:32.483
I have created a demographic model of Latinos in Los Angeles County from 1781 to 2017.

32:35.806 --> 32:39.850
And I can tell you who is here, how they got here, what generation they were, whom they married.

32:42.513 --> 32:48.098
And to make a long story short, there have been

32:48.702 --> 33:00.874
eight waves of immigration from Mexico to here in the past 250 years on about 30 year cycles, leaving Mexico for different reasons.

33:00.894 --> 33:13.145
And that has a lot to do with what will happen is Latinos were the charter group that brought Western society to California, the charter group.

33:13.165 --> 33:17.950
They were a slice of Mexican society, identity and culture.

33:19.550 --> 33:27.479
And they clearly represented that demographic.

33:27.499 --> 33:40.114
If you look at the monument to the Pobladores downtown at La Placita, they were Indian, they were African, they were Mestizo, they were Mulatto.

33:40.975 --> 33:45.540
Only two of the 44 were EspaÃ±ol.

33:46.094 --> 34:13.705
and i put that in comillas because to call somebody espanol in northern frontier new spain didn't necessarily mean you were from spain right could mean you spoke spanish it could mean you fought for the king you weren't necessarily from spain and both of them were married to indians so their kids obviously were mestizos so they were not from spain okay what got me into this i realized about

34:14.242 --> 34:16.285
2003, I know when the Spanish got here.

34:16.346 --> 34:18.689
Father said, I was taught that in the school.

34:19.250 --> 34:23.197
I lived two blocks from Mission San Luis Obispo in third grade, and we learned California history.

34:23.638 --> 34:27.644
I realized, okay, but when did the Mexicans get here?

34:27.664 --> 34:27.945
Nothing.

34:27.985 --> 34:31.110
I read all the history books, nothing.

34:31.130 --> 34:32.813
They were Spanish, or thought they were.

34:34.055 --> 34:37.060
So that's why I did, we pulled the data.

34:39.689 --> 34:47.399
So the first charter group that was Western, but it was the Western society as interpreted by Indians and Africans and mestizos and mulattos.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.941
That was their daily lived experience.

34:49.021 --> 34:49.922
So they brought it up here.

34:51.684 --> 34:53.807
Intermarried a lot with the local indigenous.

34:55.348 --> 34:57.211
In fact, I do a lot of work on Cinco de Mayo.

34:59.293 --> 35:06.462
One of the first poblanos actually came with the answer in 1775 from Chalchipomula.

35:06.823 --> 35:07.804
He spoke Nahual.

35:08.905 --> 35:09.426
He was here.

35:09.642 --> 35:10.303
moved to L.A.

35:10.343 --> 35:22.400
about 1790, married a Tongavit wife, and he was on the city council, an Aztec speaker married to a Tongavit speaker.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.422
They had four kids, then later on he had .

35:25.384 --> 35:29.429
His wife died, so he marries a Chumash, and they have more kids.

35:30.911 --> 35:37.320
One of his great grandsons is a member of the Spanish-speaking

35:37.672 --> 35:38.012
U.S.

35:38.032 --> 35:41.737
Cavalry out of California and fought in the Civil War.

35:41.757 --> 35:42.338
Okay.

35:42.358 --> 35:47.304
Now, that doesn't sound like anybody's history of California either, but that's what we have in the data.

35:47.324 --> 35:48.265
Right.

35:48.285 --> 35:51.088
So we were a part of Mexico.

35:51.108 --> 35:58.757
And up until 1848, we were a regional variant of Mexican society identity behavior.

35:58.777 --> 35:58.878
Yeah.

35:58.898 --> 36:04.524
Then came what I call, and these are my terms, the Latino Big Bang.

36:04.544 --> 36:06.767
Ten days that shook the Spanish-speaking world.

36:07.355 --> 36:10.079
Not only here, but around the hemisphere.

36:10.921 --> 36:11.061
Uh-huh.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.425
January 24th, 1848, gold is discovered.

36:14.046 --> 36:14.186
Uh-huh.

36:14.206 --> 36:19.214
Sets off a huge immigration from Mexico, Central America to South America into California looking for gold.

36:19.815 --> 36:19.915
Yeah.

36:19.935 --> 36:21.858
That historians have totally overlooked.

36:22.038 --> 36:22.819
Right.

36:22.839 --> 36:24.502
But I have the data.

36:24.522 --> 36:27.787
I can tell you who got here, when they got here, how they got here, where they were.

36:29.450 --> 36:32.134
Ten days later, we're suddenly part of the United States.

36:32.615 --> 36:32.755
Uh-huh.

36:33.325 --> 36:48.057
Now, the Mexican Constitution, when Hidalgo declared independence, he also declared in 1810 the abolition of slavery, racial equality, and citizenship, and continued the old Iberian legal tradition that married women owned property separately from their husband.

36:48.077 --> 36:49.499
1848, along comes the U.S.

36:49.519 --> 36:55.644
Constitution that allows slavery, denies citizenship to non-white, and when a woman marries, she suffered legal deaths.

36:55.664 --> 36:56.745
The Latinos didn't like that.

36:57.586 --> 37:00.668
So they went to the California Constitutional Convention, argued.

37:01.449 --> 37:02.910
We came in as a bilingual state.

37:04.612 --> 37:06.995
Married women had property rights separately from the husband.

37:07.495 --> 37:08.877
Non-whites could become citizens.

37:09.658 --> 37:13.963
And we were a free state without an accompanying slave state per the Missouri compromise.

37:14.204 --> 37:15.185
We upset the balance.

37:15.786 --> 37:16.867
We caused the Civil War.

37:18.629 --> 37:21.532
So we had a big save all of this.

37:21.553 --> 37:22.534
But the history books.

37:22.774 --> 37:23.335
Right.

37:23.355 --> 37:24.616
So we're putting it in.

37:24.636 --> 37:25.617
So we've had constant.

37:25.958 --> 37:29.262
However, during that big bang period, that's one big change.

37:31.124 --> 37:34.348
The civil society here started to shift from being

37:34.767 --> 37:42.734
a regional variant of Mexican society to something brand new, the Bilingual Bicultural Civil Society of Latinos de Estados Unidos.

37:42.754 --> 37:47.898
It took about one generation to make that by about 1870s pretty much complete, and it has been here ever since.

37:49.099 --> 37:56.206
When new immigrants arrive, basically they arrive and settle in amongst the pre-existing group, and that's the group they assimilate to.

37:56.226 --> 38:01.170
And then they bring their understanding of things such as race, identity, culture, etc.

38:01.871 --> 38:03.492
at that time, and that gets

38:03.910 --> 38:23.961
shared here etc so the chicano generation by and large were the descendants of the sixth wave of immigration refugees fleeing the mexican revolution you had a seventh wave but it was a ghost wave the braceros but they weren't immigrants because they couldn't stay here yeah

38:26.793 --> 38:40.470
But then when the immigration laws changed in 1965, along with the demise of the Bracero program, actually a big chunk of the immigrants had already complained about in 1994, where Braceros had been invited to simply change their status to immigrant.

38:40.510 --> 38:43.614
That was the bulk of them.

38:44.134 --> 38:45.596
We had to ask them in.

38:46.697 --> 38:55.348
So at any rate, Chicanos tended to be either the grandchildren of those fleeing the Mexican Revolution or the children of the Braceros,

38:55.987 --> 38:59.551
We're probably going to say this at the time they were conceived.

38:59.571 --> 39:03.256
Then you started getting a new wave of immigration, 1965.

39:05.338 --> 39:06.920
And that lasted until about 1990.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.924
And then here in California, it kind of tailed off.

39:09.964 --> 39:13.488
Basically, immigration has been just about zero.

39:13.628 --> 39:17.813
I mean, you get people moving back and forth, but as many leave has come in.

39:17.833 --> 39:21.637
And they have had children.

39:21.657 --> 39:23.800
And I teach one undergraduate class here.

39:24.337 --> 39:46.918
because i'm primarily in graduate medical education but i make sure right i'm trying to get kids into this so i teach one undergraduate class there are about 120 students in it and it's on latino health policy so generally you're only 95 latino students and i used to do just to show the power of demographics i started this class right after the strike here in 94.

39:50.155 --> 39:54.139
So I'd ask people what generation they were, you know, first generation to stand up.

39:54.159 --> 40:01.086
So I remember in 1995, I think is the first year I taught it, about a third of the students stood up.

40:01.106 --> 40:04.049
Those who are children of immigrants, about another third stood up.

40:04.069 --> 40:07.392
And those who are children, grandchildren of immigrants, about another third.

40:07.432 --> 40:12.718
In fact, I used to get students come in and say, hey, my parents had to say hi because we've been involved in the Chicano movement.

40:12.738 --> 40:16.702
Gradually, it moved up to about almost half was immigrant by 2005.

40:17.022 --> 40:20.145
And now that's slowed down.

40:20.412 --> 40:36.569
So eight months ago, it was in January when I asked who's an immigrant out of 120 people, about 10 stood up who are children of immigrants, everybody, grandchildren.

40:36.589 --> 40:40.814
So those students in that class are not my grandchildren.

40:40.834 --> 40:44.437
They're the children of that wave that came after the Chicano movement.

40:44.978 --> 40:45.098
Right.

40:45.118 --> 40:48.662
So that when I mentioned Cesar Chavez, they think of the boxer.

40:48.682 --> 40:48.782
Yeah.

40:50.517 --> 40:53.361
And people haven't, I mean, Sanchez hasn't figured this out.

40:53.401 --> 40:58.169
Remember when the Brown Beret were having their 40th anniversary, I think?

40:59.911 --> 41:00.973
It was in the mid-90s.

41:02.435 --> 41:04.959
Maybe it was 2000, maybe 2000, somewhere in there.

41:05.540 --> 41:08.845
And he was angry that nobody was showing up.

41:08.865 --> 41:11.969
And so actually I wrote a column because he and I got into a heated argument.

41:12.009 --> 41:16.997
I kept telling them, look, it's not like they stopped being Chicano or this.

41:18.378 --> 41:19.019
I did the numbers.

41:19.039 --> 41:24.548
80% of Latinos in LA County were either arrived after or were born after the Brown Berets.

41:25.089 --> 41:27.853
How are they going to know about it organically?

41:27.873 --> 41:28.014
Yeah.

41:28.414 --> 41:29.396
They're not.

41:29.416 --> 41:30.197
We have to teach.

41:30.538 --> 41:30.858
Right.

41:31.219 --> 41:33.262
But that's not what they grow up with.

41:33.863 --> 41:37.429
Our kids, my wife and I have had, our kids have been in our laboratory.

41:38.891 --> 41:45.482
God, I remember, I was still in high school all the year, 1999, 2000, having dinner.

41:45.985 --> 41:51.513
My wife and I talked about the Chicano days, and our daughter piped up, well, I'm not a Chicana.

41:52.234 --> 41:52.535
Okay.

41:53.516 --> 41:54.478
What are you?

41:54.498 --> 41:55.039
Mexicana.

41:55.239 --> 41:57.823
I'm Latina, but I'm not a Chicana.

41:57.903 --> 41:58.624
Okay, mijita.

41:59.445 --> 42:02.149
When you hear the word Chicano, what comes to your mind?

42:02.169 --> 42:04.393
And here's what she said.

42:04.413 --> 42:10.261
Well, Dad, when I hear the word Chicano, I think of some old dudes with great beers and fat bellies sitting around drinking beer and complaining.

42:11.623 --> 42:13.326
Oops.

42:14.065 --> 42:18.371
both for her and our son, Chicano is retro.

42:18.391 --> 42:19.733
Um, it's back there.

42:19.753 --> 42:24.499
And sometimes for some reason they'll put it on, but it's kind of right now they can take it off because they're different.

42:25.721 --> 42:30.548
And then you get the post millennials, the children of the children that were born out of that last wave.

42:30.588 --> 42:33.852
So it's, and that's the way it's been going on since 1848.

42:34.133 --> 42:34.373
Yeah.

42:34.934 --> 42:39.380
Constantly new waves, older waves complaining about these new waves don't understand what happened.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.503
And that's how we lost Cinco de Mayo, the history.

42:42.725 --> 42:42.925
Um,

42:43.900 --> 42:46.284
It got lost because of constant new waves.

42:46.304 --> 42:49.931
We didn't have any institutional way of passing it on.

42:49.951 --> 42:59.569
Now we do, called Chicano studies, ethnic studies, but the view we give still is very incomplete, which is why we felt compelled to write our history in the Chicano health movement.

42:59.589 --> 43:02.294
It's simply not even mentioned.

43:02.314 --> 43:03.155
Not even mentioned.

43:03.636 --> 43:05.259
And we changed health policy in this state.

43:06.040 --> 43:06.381
Yeah.

43:07.036 --> 43:33.482
yeah it's interesting like especially when you like I've taken several Chicano history courses and you know you start to see a shift in the historiography where it's not just about like these very concentrated uh movements you know either like Crusade for Justice or Raza Unida or Tierra Amarilla um

43:33.901 --> 43:41.291
but you're starting to see now more of this, uh, I mean, but the problem is that they're still talking about those things.

43:41.711 --> 43:43.373
They've just kind of expanded it.

43:43.433 --> 43:43.714
Right.

43:43.754 --> 43:56.871
So like an example is there's more books on like farm workers, rural farm workers, rather than, uh, you know, a lot of the, the, uh, the typical, you know, Oh, here's what's going on in LA.

43:56.911 --> 43:59.975
Here's what's going on in San Antonio or Sacramento or whatever.

44:00.035 --> 44:00.315
Right.

44:01.397 --> 44:01.697
Um,

44:02.065 --> 44:02.986
But I think you're right.

44:03.046 --> 44:10.796
Like, we haven't gotten out of that bubble of, oh, well, here's the famous things, right?

44:10.816 --> 44:14.621
So, and that's part of, like, you know, my project.

44:15.082 --> 44:20.889
Like, I'm very interested in, like, who are the everyday people that were part of this and what were they doing?

44:20.909 --> 44:22.972
Well, let's talk about this thing called mestizaje.

44:22.992 --> 44:23.352
Yeah.

44:24.994 --> 44:31.262
Because, in fact, when I set up La Clinica, I purposely did not call it

44:31.546 --> 44:32.587
the Chicano clinic.

44:34.570 --> 44:41.279
I called it La ClÃ­nica de la Raza, using Raza in that much wider, like a familia sense.

44:41.299 --> 44:42.921
And it's still called La ClÃ­nica de la Raza.

44:42.961 --> 44:51.432
And I've actually, some people that we've interviewed actually, years after them, I stopped being director in 1974 when I took up the position.

44:51.452 --> 44:57.199
I was on the board till 1980, but now generations way after.

44:58.225 --> 45:01.688
And they have told me what it meant that it was called La Clinica de la Raza.

45:01.708 --> 45:07.614
It was kind of like this nebulous thing that almost anybody could identify with.

45:09.035 --> 45:15.501
One of the newscasters, Claudia Botero from Channel 34, came to see me.

45:15.582 --> 45:19.605
It was about 10 years ago when La Clinica was getting ready to celebrate its 40th anniversary.

45:19.625 --> 45:21.827
So I had an invitation on my desk.

45:21.847 --> 45:22.348
She saw it.

45:22.788 --> 45:25.151
She said, oh, do you know about La Clinica de la Raza?

45:25.411 --> 45:26.612
Well, yeah.

45:26.963 --> 45:29.186
the original founding director.

45:29.206 --> 45:33.453
When we immigrated, and she immigrated as a little girl with her mom, I got all my pediatric care at La ClÃ­nica.

45:33.473 --> 45:34.374
They're from Colombia.

45:36.057 --> 45:38.321
I do Latino leadership training.

45:38.561 --> 45:43.088
I remember doing a group with, I believe it was Coca-Cola in New York about 20 years ago.

45:43.429 --> 45:47.775
One of the high executives go, I got my clinical care at La ClÃ­nica de la Raza.

45:47.815 --> 45:50.239
I mean, just, it meant things to people.

45:50.259 --> 45:50.720
Different things.

45:50.740 --> 45:52.903
They could read in what it meant.

45:52.923 --> 45:53.023
Yeah.

45:53.043 --> 45:55.367
So here...

45:56.731 --> 46:00.557
A lot of people love Jose Vasconcelos, la raza cosmica.

46:01.558 --> 46:02.279
He's our man.

46:02.379 --> 46:02.880
He got it.

46:04.122 --> 46:06.685
But I have read Jose Vasconcelos.

46:07.747 --> 46:15.138
You know, we have a conference going on this November funded by NIH on racially ambiguous babies.

46:15.158 --> 46:18.563
And we have to classify them as providers.

46:18.783 --> 46:19.925
What race are they were saying?

46:19.945 --> 46:25.793
And when they're 52% racially ambiguous, 52% have mothers and fathers of different race ethnic groups.

46:27.612 --> 46:29.734
What group are we supposed to put them in and why?

46:30.254 --> 46:30.715
Yeah.

46:30.735 --> 46:34.218
Why this group and not that group?

46:34.238 --> 46:42.506
So we're looking at racial ambiguity and how we are going to be using that in biomedical research.

46:43.887 --> 46:48.592
But in the 70s, I had reason to read books.

46:48.632 --> 46:53.216
I'd heard about Jose Vasconcelos in the early days where he holds them up and reads about two paragraphs.

46:53.276 --> 46:54.898
We talked about La Raza Cosmica.

46:56.279 --> 46:57.400
But I read the whole thing.

46:57.582 --> 47:01.506
And it's actually a genocidal tract.

47:01.527 --> 47:05.952
He was figuring out what to do with the Indian problem, which has been one of the issues the Mexican state has always had.

47:05.972 --> 47:07.133
What are we going to do about the Indians?

47:07.233 --> 47:08.314
Yeah.

47:08.334 --> 47:11.878
And, you know, sort of they threw the Afro-Mexicans and the Asian Mexicans under the bus.

47:11.898 --> 47:12.960
What are we going to do with the Indians?

47:13.560 --> 47:21.750
Vasconcelos' view was, well, what we'll do is we'll pull them out of the villages, they'll intermarry, and they will disappear into La Raza Cosmica.

47:22.050 --> 47:22.170
Right.

47:22.230 --> 47:24.092
That's how we solve the Indian problem.

47:24.513 --> 47:24.653
Mm-hmm.

47:25.747 --> 47:28.310
He was advocating basically cultural genocide.

47:28.330 --> 47:29.251
Yeah.

47:29.271 --> 47:31.753
And Chicagos to this day still say, oh yeah, he's got it.

47:31.874 --> 47:38.501
Every time I cringe because that's not what he meant, but it's what was taken.

47:38.521 --> 47:40.002
That's how people chose to interpret it.

47:40.423 --> 47:41.064
Yeah.

47:41.104 --> 47:46.309
Well, and I think, I mean, I don't know if it was even just that people interpret it that way.

47:46.349 --> 47:48.632
I mean, I think that's the way it was promoted.

47:48.872 --> 47:49.192
Right.

47:50.073 --> 47:54.538
And I don't know if you're familiar with Bon Fil Batalla.

47:54.805 --> 47:56.888
what the heck is his name, first name, Guillermo?

47:57.729 --> 47:59.250
He's Mexican.

47:59.270 --> 48:00.472
Yeah.

48:00.872 --> 48:07.020
And in that, I mean, he calls it out and he says, this is ethnocide, right?

48:07.040 --> 48:07.200
Yeah.

48:07.921 --> 48:19.615
And so since we're talking about that, I think I want to ask you about whether you were

48:19.983 --> 48:25.608
Like, where did you become informed about that idea or that concept of mestizo, mestizo?

48:25.628 --> 48:28.471
Well, it's complicated.

48:28.491 --> 48:31.854
And as everything goes back to family history.

48:32.375 --> 48:35.838
My grandfather would come to L.A.

48:36.419 --> 48:45.187
about 120 years ago during the Mexican Revolution, was very involved with Emiliano.

48:45.307 --> 48:49.551
Our family town was founded in the year 1238.

48:50.071 --> 48:51.854
It's still there.

48:51.874 --> 48:53.717
Atlautla, right on the slopes of the volcano.

48:55.199 --> 48:57.403
And that's Zapata country.

48:57.423 --> 49:05.616
Now, he was living up here, but he actually organized Juntas PatriÃ³ticas de Emiliano Zapata all around the West.

49:06.217 --> 49:11.185
In Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, California.

49:11.570 --> 49:14.293
to raise funds to send to Zapata.

49:14.774 --> 49:15.976
He's very involved politically.

49:16.356 --> 49:18.158
He loved the Mexican revolution.

49:18.178 --> 49:23.745
He loved the Indigenista movement so much that in 1920, he went back to Mexico.

49:25.367 --> 49:32.196
Only my grandma and her kids were here and they didn't go back to Mexico.

49:32.256 --> 49:35.400
So it costs some bad blood in the family.

49:35.988 --> 49:38.831
The story, one side that my grandma, he abandoned us.

49:39.111 --> 49:43.616
The story, because I linked up with the other side of the family as an undergraduate.

49:43.636 --> 49:45.278
That's part of my finding my voice.

49:45.518 --> 49:46.439
I want to hear the other side.

49:46.480 --> 49:49.683
Then Grace, he'd send the money every year and they'd never come and visit.

49:50.664 --> 49:52.106
Not even for a week.

49:52.126 --> 49:53.788
Okay, go figure.

49:53.808 --> 49:55.990
He got really involved in the Indigenista movement.

49:57.051 --> 50:00.775
And he wrote a history of Mexico.

50:00.795 --> 50:01.796
A cockeyed history.

50:01.816 --> 50:03.278
He was an autodidact.

50:03.983 --> 50:06.546
He spoke, Nahuatl was his first language.

50:07.287 --> 50:09.629
Then he went to school and I learned Spanish.

50:10.570 --> 50:12.733
And then he lived up here, of course, learned English.

50:12.773 --> 50:14.495
Then he went on and read other things.

50:14.535 --> 50:18.640
He was very intelligent, never went beyond sixth grade, but an autodidact.

50:18.660 --> 50:19.721
This was your grandpa.

50:19.741 --> 50:21.142
My grandpa on my mother's side.

50:21.183 --> 50:21.483
Yeah.

50:22.204 --> 50:28.150
So he goes back to Mexico, gets very involved in the Indian Easton movement, wrote this cockeyed history of Mexico.

50:28.190 --> 50:29.692
Basically, I can summarize it.

50:30.093 --> 50:31.775
Anything good, we Indians did it.

50:31.915 --> 50:33.537
Anything bad, the Spanish brought that.

50:33.557 --> 50:33.957
A little bit

50:34.291 --> 50:35.432
Mm-hmm.

50:36.093 --> 50:39.878
But he used to boast that there was not one drop of Spanish blood in our family.

50:40.639 --> 50:40.779
Mm-hmm.

50:40.799 --> 50:43.763
Now, our town has an interesting history, and it's not unique.

50:43.823 --> 50:44.343
Other towns did.

50:44.363 --> 50:45.204
It was founded in 1238.

50:47.247 --> 50:56.398
We were conquered by Alicotl, the eighth Aztec emperor in 1488, and we were incorporated into the Aztec empire, which we did not like.

50:56.418 --> 50:59.722
The Paso de Cortes is only about five kilometers away.

50:59.742 --> 50:59.882
Mm-hmm.

50:59.902 --> 51:01.925
And people remember, they talk about it all the time.

51:01.965 --> 51:03.927
Basically, Cortes was the game changer.

51:04.936 --> 51:06.057
And we got our freedom back.

51:07.659 --> 51:22.595
And then we became, in 50, the Franciscans had the idea that the Spanish were corrupting Indians, which they were, because they wanted to set up Indian communities that would be free of Spanish influence.

51:22.896 --> 51:28.842
So our village said, okay, we were, we said, we'll do that.

51:28.862 --> 51:29.403
What do we got to do?

51:29.523 --> 51:30.364
You got to get baptized.

51:30.424 --> 51:30.664
Okay.

51:30.684 --> 51:31.565
What does it cost to pass?

51:31.625 --> 51:32.226
Okay, we'll do it.

51:32.746 --> 51:42.179
And they still conserve, I have a picture of it on my laptop, the D1555 making this town one of these utopias, which meant nobody could ever come in and take the lands.

51:42.980 --> 51:47.946
So they have maintained their society and everything else to this day.

51:50.550 --> 51:56.198
And up until World War II, Nahuatl was the first language people had learned.

51:56.458 --> 51:57.700
Then they learned Spanish as a second.

51:57.720 --> 51:59.001
It's changed since World War II.

51:59.562 --> 52:02.466
The highway got put in, the railroad got put in.

52:02.902 --> 52:06.145
And I have a cousin that used to commute from the village to Mexico City.

52:06.185 --> 52:08.007
She was a special ed teacher.

52:08.027 --> 52:11.750
But he was, you could call him an indigenous nationalist.

52:11.770 --> 52:12.350
He really was.

52:12.390 --> 52:15.854
I mean, just, you're Indian, Indian, Indian.

52:18.056 --> 52:18.996
And he hated the Spanish.

52:21.138 --> 52:22.359
So I grew up with that.

52:22.379 --> 52:26.503
We are Indians and we hate the Spanish.

52:27.444 --> 52:31.928
So when they come to this, you know, indigenous, hey, well, I know that.

52:31.948 --> 52:32.048
Yeah.

52:32.483 --> 52:53.698
um but of course when i'd say i'm indian oh so what tribe are you from well um well actually not from one of these u.s tribes right oh so you're not indian you're a mexican well but he had this other view he didn't like mestizos he didn't like the spanish he was he was just a little strange

52:53.965 --> 52:55.586
Very active, but a little strange.

52:55.606 --> 53:07.157
So was it like a reaction to that idea or that real heavy kind of government push of mestizaje that's going on at that time?

53:07.217 --> 53:08.818
Oh, he was against that.

53:09.179 --> 53:12.882
Yeah, that he's like, no, we are not this thing.

53:12.962 --> 53:14.203
We're Indians.

53:14.223 --> 53:20.709
I don't know that he ever talked to Vasconcelos, but they would have had a knock-down, drag-out argument because he was very indigenous.

53:20.809 --> 53:22.791
And that comes through the family emergency.

53:23.311 --> 53:24.733
Somos indio, asÃ­ que.

53:26.074 --> 53:36.565
And of course, what's interesting is that beginning about 1980, you started getting immigration from indigenous from Chiapas and Oaxaca up into that area.

53:36.946 --> 53:40.169
Milpalpa, you know, the town that Foster was in.

53:41.491 --> 53:44.034
So you have indigenous, but they don't speak Nahua.

53:44.134 --> 53:48.038
They speak Mixteco, Zapoteco, and you have the Nahua speakers.

53:50.260 --> 53:51.782
So now you have a new

53:53.163 --> 54:19.339
concept arriving and say so when you come who are the indigenous oh those they speak mixed text sapotec are you indigenous oh no that's the new term because you know you're getting intra-indigenous yeah if you will but this is how they at least the ones who say they were there first

54:19.522 --> 54:45.242
say it or somos pueblo originario they are the indians saying this and not wanting to force fascinating stuff going on so it's a way to put down the the other and the others are kind of like mexicans here they do the farm work they live on the outskirts of town it's hard for them because these pueblos originarios still have these titles so you can't just come in and say i want to buy some land it's a very involved process right right

54:46.117 --> 54:51.746
So I kind of came at it from a slightly different perspective because of my grandpa.

54:51.766 --> 55:01.863
Yeah, and that's actually been really interesting with some of my interviews is how people have gotten or were exposed to this idea.

55:03.886 --> 55:06.650
Let me just show you something two days ago that happened.

55:06.670 --> 55:06.971
Sure.

55:10.316 --> 55:11.398
In our family town.

55:19.664 --> 55:20.566
I don't think it's over.

55:22.289 --> 55:43.748
Just two days ago, September 16th, this is my grandpa, Margarito Bautista Valencia, and my great-grandfather, Jose de la Luz Bautista, and they were given a September 16th.

55:45.196 --> 55:46.738
And what is that for?

55:46.918 --> 55:49.160
It was just a commemoration.

55:49.180 --> 55:50.461
It was interesting.

55:51.302 --> 55:57.588
It used to be, it would have been for Hombres Ilustres, now it's Personajes Ilustres.

55:57.609 --> 56:06.497
If you go in Guadalajara, there's this Rotonda that for 150 years called Rotonda Los Hombres Ilustres.

56:06.517 --> 56:11.603
And I just noticed two years ago, they sort of reworked it so it's Personajes Ilustres.

56:11.683 --> 56:13.404
They actually have women in there now.

56:13.424 --> 56:14.005
So anyway,

56:14.474 --> 56:16.337
He went back and he stayed there and he died there.

56:17.238 --> 56:18.260
Wow, interesting.

56:18.320 --> 56:19.842
Very happily involved in all his life.

56:21.164 --> 56:22.446
That was just two days ago.

56:23.107 --> 56:24.209
So I sent some words down.

56:24.529 --> 56:27.354
I was connecting, okay, here's grandpa, great grandpa doing this.

56:27.874 --> 56:28.796
I was doing this up here.

56:29.877 --> 56:31.380
They were my models.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.944
Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

56:34.064 --> 56:41.675
See, you could have mentioned that when I asked you about the, what was the links between your experiences.

56:41.695 --> 56:42.777
Most families, families.

56:43.043 --> 56:49.070
In every case, in every single one of these 183 interviews, it's always the case, it's personal biography.

56:49.090 --> 56:49.230
Mm-hmm.

56:49.250 --> 56:51.633
And then finding your voice through that personal biography.

56:51.673 --> 56:51.793
Right.

56:51.813 --> 56:53.775
And everybody has a different biography, no two are alike.

56:54.256 --> 56:56.619
Yeah, yeah.

56:57.179 --> 57:08.292
So, I mean, I think this is good for the Messisaha stuff because that's really kind of like the question I'm trying to get at is,

57:09.149 --> 57:38.127
uh like i'm really interested in in what i've perceived to be a gap and i'm learning more and more that there's really not there's not a gap between like vasconcelos mestizaje and then the mestizaje that gets uh like reinvigorated from chicanos during the chicano movement you know whether from like corgi gonzalez to you know the aloristas luis valdezes all of that um

57:38.798 --> 58:03.179
Because to me, like in my research, it's like, there's a, there's a jump, uh, from messy side being this popular thing in Mexico to then all of a sudden it's here and all these, you know, young radicals are, are using it as a way to, to reclaim some kind of identity.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.120
Right.

58:04.140 --> 58:07.523
Well, um, actually there's demographic history.

58:08.060 --> 58:15.451
that antedates that this has been part of the condition of the civil society of Latinos de Estados Unidos.

58:16.212 --> 58:28.270
What happened in California during the colonial period, actually, even before Mexican independence, the folks came up and they were part of that 16-way caste system, the castas.

58:29.512 --> 58:34.860
Even during the colonial period, that began to shift and morph and started to flatten.

58:35.532 --> 58:43.961
There was what I call caste creep that somebody who arrived, there were a mulatto, then became an indio, then became a mestizo by the time they died.

58:44.582 --> 58:49.768
Almost always in a light, lighter upwards way, but you started to get a lot of movement.

58:52.170 --> 58:59.158
And finally, by about 1810, by the time Mexico declared independence, actually they had become so useless as categories.

58:59.178 --> 58:59.939
Yeah.

58:59.959 --> 59:03.463
There are only two categories that were used to identify people.

59:03.933 --> 59:15.565
You're either , which meant you're a Catholic, you nominally lived a European, you wore shoes, you ate wheat, or you were , not yet a Catholic.

59:16.927 --> 59:19.870
But it wasn't a racial designation the way it was in the U.S.

59:19.890 --> 59:23.694
It was more of a cultural identity, religious, very heavily religious.

59:23.955 --> 59:29.080
And yet it was also quite porous, just like the Poblano, the Mary Tongavit, then a Chumash lady.

59:29.667 --> 59:31.570
You know, it's porous.

59:31.590 --> 59:32.591
It's different from the U.S.

59:32.852 --> 59:35.496
way of racial categorization.

59:35.516 --> 59:37.198
Then, of course, you get Mexican independence.

59:37.378 --> 59:41.044
And Mexico says everybody is a citizen.

59:41.084 --> 59:42.546
They stop asking caste.

59:42.606 --> 59:45.170
And you don't see it in the Mexican census until 1930.

59:45.270 --> 59:45.490
Right.

59:46.512 --> 59:48.355
They stop asking everybody.

59:48.375 --> 59:50.097
And even then, they only asked, were you Chinese?

59:50.157 --> 59:51.019
Only because the U.S.

59:51.099 --> 59:54.944
was president because they were getting too much Chinese immigration over the border.

59:54.964 --> 59:56.046
So they stopped asking it.

59:58.793 --> 01:00:00.335
So by the time the U.S.

01:00:00.355 --> 01:00:05.021
came around, I mean, race just wasn't, it hadn't been used.

01:00:05.762 --> 01:00:07.904
You're either, you still had gentiles.

01:00:09.186 --> 01:00:11.048
And you had gente de razÃ³n.

01:00:11.068 --> 01:00:12.450
They used those terms.

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:14.733
In fact, they used them up through the 19th century.

01:00:14.793 --> 01:00:15.574
But along comes the U.S.

01:00:15.634 --> 01:00:18.177
And so he insists that people be a member of a race.

01:00:19.018 --> 01:00:20.500
And that has upset Latinos.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.685
And we've had the same reaction then that we're seeing now.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:27.889
You get some who are happy being white.

01:00:29.253 --> 01:00:30.254
or claiming to be white.

01:00:31.515 --> 01:00:31.695
Right.

01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:33.217
Most are not.

01:00:33.237 --> 01:00:35.780
It's not that they're ashamed, but they're, why is this a big deal?

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:42.947
I remember in the California Constitution Convention, Pablo de la Guerra said, look, nature has given some of us a very dark skin, but we are from the state.

01:00:43.527 --> 01:00:44.508
What do you mean we can't vote?

01:00:45.169 --> 01:00:47.231
Define what is white, which they couldn't.

01:00:47.251 --> 01:00:47.371
Right.

01:00:49.373 --> 01:00:51.395
So this has been a constant ongoing thing.

01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:59.243
The classic Mexican history, Mexico a PrevÃ©s de los AÃ±os, was written in the early 1880s.

01:01:00.117 --> 01:01:02.860
And it was here in California.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.261
People were reading it.

01:01:04.281 --> 01:01:08.346
I was at the Dana Adobe up in San Luis Obispo just a year ago.

01:01:09.527 --> 01:01:14.853
They've restored the Adobe and there was a full set Mexico a travÃ©s de los signos.

01:01:16.074 --> 01:01:18.637
So they knew about it.

01:01:19.198 --> 01:01:21.380
You had interchange of newspapers and everything else.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.842
So this issue of who are we?

01:01:23.983 --> 01:01:24.703
Are we Indian?

01:01:24.743 --> 01:01:25.264
Are we Spanish?

01:01:25.632 --> 01:01:29.177
And you get those who say, well, really we're Spanish and others say really we're Indian.

01:01:29.437 --> 01:01:30.699
Well, kind of in between.

01:01:31.079 --> 01:01:33.683
This has been going on since 1848.

01:01:34.103 --> 01:01:37.127
So actually these discussions are nothing new.

01:01:37.868 --> 01:01:37.968
Yeah.

01:01:37.988 --> 01:01:39.350
Nothing new.

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:39.470
Yeah.

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:40.832
We've been having them all along.

01:01:41.693 --> 01:01:44.637
Can you be claimed to be Latino and not speak Spanish?

01:01:44.718 --> 01:01:47.061
We start seeing that as early as the Civil War.

01:01:47.882 --> 01:01:49.445
We're using pochismos.

01:01:49.465 --> 01:01:59.078
That means you're not really totally Latino because you say groserÃ­a instead of abarrotero, right?

01:01:59.499 --> 01:02:01.762
Or you say marqueta instead of mercado.

01:02:01.782 --> 01:02:03.584
So you're pocho and lost.

01:02:04.786 --> 01:02:07.250
This has been going on now for six generations.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.890
Yeah.

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:09.252
Nothing new.

01:02:09.272 --> 01:02:11.856
So would you say...

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:22.876
Is it that it's just a, like, okay, so some people I talk to and they say, well, no, I never read about it.

01:02:22.916 --> 01:02:34.728
It was just something I thought was like common sense that these are just ideas that you've been, you and your family have been living with for generations.

01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:39.953
And because my kind of perspective on it was

01:02:41.215 --> 01:03:08.826
you know are people reading this are they reading vasconcelos um or where is it coming from and and there's a lot of different like kind of avenues that i'm discovering here and you know one is like yeah some people are probably reading it some people are you know they're so connected with people from the revolution those are like their grandparents remember those terms go back to colonial yes new spain yeah and

01:03:08.907 --> 01:03:12.972
You had the 16-way categories, the castas, and mestizo is only one of the 16.

01:03:12.992 --> 01:03:13.112
Yes.

01:03:14.273 --> 01:03:18.738
So that term has just been part of civil society for almost 500 years.

01:03:18.778 --> 01:03:19.018
Yeah.

01:03:19.138 --> 01:03:25.125
Now, its meanings have shifted and changed, but the idea of somehow you're in between, you're a mixture.

01:03:26.166 --> 01:03:28.349
At times, that's good, like the Mexican Revolution.

01:03:28.389 --> 01:03:30.511
At times, like under perfidium, it's bad.

01:03:30.671 --> 01:03:31.172
Yeah.

01:03:31.192 --> 01:03:32.073
But it is.

01:03:32.093 --> 01:03:32.433
Okay?

01:03:32.453 --> 01:03:34.135
It is what it is.

01:03:34.155 --> 01:03:38.340
And so we had likewise then up here in California with the added edge,

01:03:38.742 --> 01:03:45.193
In California that up until the 1940s, as they were setting up the Mexican schools, separate segregated.

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:53.868
One of the reasons why they did it, for example, up in Ventura County was because really Mexicans are Indians and Indians can't go to school with white people.

01:03:53.908 --> 01:03:55.631
That's why we're setting up a school for the Indians.

01:03:55.791 --> 01:03:56.332
Yeah.

01:03:57.634 --> 01:04:00.359
And they also didn't want to go to school with blacks either.

01:04:01.381 --> 01:04:02.202
If there was blacks.

01:04:02.468 --> 01:04:02.808
Yeah.

01:04:02.828 --> 01:04:03.769
In that community.

01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:05.832
So that's how we got the, or with Chinese either.

01:04:05.852 --> 01:04:08.335
So that's how we got to say, because we were Indians.

01:04:08.355 --> 01:04:12.399
So it's always kind of a mushy term, but it's in the civil society.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.523
Everybody will use it, even though they don't know where it came from.

01:04:16.784 --> 01:04:23.251
In the census, and I started noticing this in the 1980 census, which is the first time they have that Hispanic identifier.

01:04:24.933 --> 01:04:29.218
And about half of Latinos nationally,

01:04:29.857 --> 01:04:34.123
When asked what race are you, white, black, Asian, Indian, or other, about half said they're white.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:39.630
Almost none said they're black or Indian or Asian.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:41.773
And about half said, I have no idea.

01:04:41.793 --> 01:04:43.956
I must be some other race.

01:04:43.976 --> 01:04:49.083
And that has been consistent up to the last census.

01:04:49.603 --> 01:04:49.884
Yeah.

01:04:52.187 --> 01:04:56.332
I was on a advisory committee to the 1980 census because they were going to put that Hispanic in.

01:04:56.613 --> 01:04:57.774
I was with Leo Estrada.

01:04:57.814 --> 01:04:59.256
We were both on this advisory committee.

01:04:59.776 --> 01:05:03.121
And they were trying to use Hispanic like a race.

01:05:03.141 --> 01:05:04.823
We kept saying, well, it's not really a race.

01:05:06.185 --> 01:05:10.151
And we didn't like the way they were operationalizing it.

01:05:10.552 --> 01:05:17.182
And I remember when they did the 1980 census, they did the first summary file one, which is where they do the congressional redistricting.

01:05:17.923 --> 01:05:24.012
And I remember this guy from the Census Bureau came up and he had a sheet of papers in his hand and he was furious.

01:05:24.372 --> 01:05:26.796
And he said, do you realize in the 1980 census

01:05:27.468 --> 01:05:30.912
Half of Hispanics failed to respond correctly to the question on race.

01:05:31.733 --> 01:05:34.317
What do you mean we failed to answer?

01:05:34.337 --> 01:05:35.518
You're asking the wrong question.

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:36.279
Yeah.

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:37.080
Okay.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.303
So we've always had to deal with that.

01:05:39.583 --> 01:05:41.446
It's always over there.

01:05:41.466 --> 01:05:44.710
But that doesn't allow of in between.

01:05:46.852 --> 01:05:47.213
Yeah.

01:05:47.233 --> 01:05:49.175
But Mestizo is kind of an in between.

01:05:49.215 --> 01:05:55.844
And the Census Bureau a couple years ago tried different questions to ask Latinos about race.

01:05:55.864 --> 01:05:56.985
And when they asked Mestizo...

01:05:57.472 --> 01:06:00.715
If you ask, are you Indian?

01:06:00.736 --> 01:06:02.177
Very few Latinos say they're Indian.

01:06:02.257 --> 01:06:03.178
Ask if they're indigenous.

01:06:03.198 --> 01:06:05.441
About a third say, yeah, I'm indigenous, but not Indian.

01:06:06.722 --> 01:06:10.626
Or even if you ask if you're Afro-Latino, about a quarter will say, yeah.

01:06:10.646 --> 01:06:11.687
But if you ask, are you black?

01:06:12.128 --> 01:06:13.389
No.

01:06:13.409 --> 01:06:17.594
Because those are sort of the preconceived, if you will, U.S.

01:06:17.654 --> 01:06:18.455
racial narratives.

01:06:18.955 --> 01:06:21.037
We just don't fit these things.

01:06:21.057 --> 01:06:22.839
But we have our own in-between categories.

01:06:22.859 --> 01:06:24.601
We're more comfortable being multivalent.

01:06:25.162 --> 01:06:25.302
Mm-hmm.

01:06:26.395 --> 01:06:27.096
Yeah.

01:06:27.136 --> 01:06:29.099
Civil society speaking.

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.802
Yeah.

01:06:30.962 --> 01:06:32.164
Interesting stuff.

01:06:33.686 --> 01:06:34.367
Oops.

01:06:34.387 --> 01:06:37.552
Yeah, I think we're over our 4 o'clock time.

01:06:37.572 --> 01:06:40.757
Okay, just a couple of quick questions or something.

01:06:42.019 --> 01:06:45.144
No, I mean, I don't have any other questions.

01:06:45.224 --> 01:06:49.070
I mean, that's mostly what I wanted to get from this.

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:50.832
If you have anything else you want to add.

01:06:51.914 --> 01:06:53.196
Get my 2017 book.

01:06:54.290 --> 01:06:55.131
Which is what?

01:06:55.431 --> 01:06:56.753
La Nueva California.

01:06:56.773 --> 01:06:57.153
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:57.373 --> 01:06:57.493
Okay.

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.656
Latinos from pioneers to post-millennials.

01:07:00.256 --> 01:07:01.197
Because I deal with this.

01:07:02.238 --> 01:07:12.229
And in fact, I point out, racially, we are Indo, Afro, Oriental, Ibero, Americanos.

01:07:12.889 --> 01:07:19.877
And by the way, at my conference having November, we have a panel from Genomics.

01:07:19.897 --> 01:07:21.438
What does Genomics teach us about?

01:07:21.598 --> 01:07:23.200
We are basically, yes, that's who we are.

01:07:23.602 --> 01:07:30.293
Yeah, they've done this called the thousand genomes project all over Latin America and also a sample here in L.A.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:36.743
Basically, every Latino has some indigenous.

01:07:37.945 --> 01:07:43.334
Every Latino has some European and every Latino has some African.

01:07:43.354 --> 01:07:43.715
Yeah.

01:07:44.676 --> 01:07:47.881
So by the one drop rule, 90 percent of us are African.

01:07:47.901 --> 01:07:48.242
Right.

01:07:49.387 --> 01:08:12.660
you ever think about um i don't know if you're familiar with like jack forbes's work on mestizaje um but he makes a really like like one of the things i i'm going to be covering in my dissertation is this idea that like only people south of the border are mestizos right and one of the things that forbes talks about is like everybody's

01:08:12.995 --> 01:08:36.623
can miss diesel right that's that's what the dna testing now has shown up much too many people's chagrin um races as separate natural homogeneous categories yeah basically don't exist yeah clinal but it's the clinal wherever you put the divide between this is not white that's like that's totally arbitrary yeah it's clinal yeah

01:08:37.953 --> 01:09:02.357
yeah interesting what are your thoughts on those dna testing because i hear like oh they're not very accurate well here's the thing to begin with this is medicine yeah it's probability yeah there's a lot of uncertainty and you may have noticed over the years well they used to say well i was so much black and so much white now they don't say that my dna comes from this region and from that region but

01:09:02.793 --> 01:09:06.158
No region was inhabited by only one quote-unquote race.

01:09:06.178 --> 01:09:06.298
Right.

01:09:06.318 --> 01:09:07.620
So it just came from that region.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.743
It doesn't mean racially anything.

01:09:10.704 --> 01:09:13.007
But people still try to impose modern maps.

01:09:13.027 --> 01:09:14.990
I mean, this is so damn funny.

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:24.684
In the census, when you talk about race, particularly given Asian, they have these different Asian races, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Filipino, et cetera.

01:09:25.525 --> 01:09:27.027
Vietnam didn't exist until 1947.

01:09:27.127 --> 01:09:27.328
Okay.

01:09:30.472 --> 01:09:31.213
That's a modern...

01:09:31.598 --> 01:09:34.742
geopolitical entity, and suddenly it's a race.

01:09:34.762 --> 01:09:35.763
It's a racial category.

01:09:36.524 --> 01:09:37.705
Check the census.

01:09:37.725 --> 01:09:40.529
And I'm thinking, well, this is really, wow.

01:09:40.549 --> 01:09:52.263
People have been living in that region 20, 30, 40,000 years, but suddenly we're going to pretend, oh, you were Vietnamese 10,000 years ago, or you were German 10,000 years ago?

01:09:52.323 --> 01:09:53.324
No.

01:09:53.344 --> 01:10:00.272
So we have continued to put our current, it's almost a presentism, but then assuming that they're there

01:10:00.573 --> 01:10:30.208
unmolested untouched they didn't move nobody moved in right right so yes real dna understands all of that the real genetics the real genomicists they understand that it's probability and it's regional just tells you what part of the globe did it come from yeah yeah well and i hear like that they're well i mean i guess that's kind of what you're talking about with the probability stuff but like they'll they'll say you can get

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:33.030
You have tests from two different companies, you're going to get two.

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.370
Yeah.

01:10:33.971 --> 01:10:35.814
They won't be totally opposite or anything.

01:10:35.854 --> 01:10:39.819
They may even look roughly alike, but you're going to get different proportions.

01:10:40.019 --> 01:10:41.361
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:41.381 --> 01:10:44.905
And if you have a sibling, your sibling will look rather different.

01:10:44.925 --> 01:10:49.751
Yeah, I was watching one on identical twins that did in.

01:10:50.392 --> 01:10:52.455
Their results were all over the place.

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:57.181
Yeah, so the idea that race, we know what it is, that it's precise.

01:10:57.201 --> 01:10:58.963
These are naturally occurring categories.

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:05.317
they're mutually exclusive, non-overlapping, they're uniform, homogeneous, and permanent, never change.

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:07.720
That's not science.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:11.484
But we use these categories in science as if they were.

01:11:12.145 --> 01:11:24.418
Yeah, and that's kind of a lot of my project is to talk about this as to separate it from that kind of biocentric view.

01:11:24.619 --> 01:11:26.841
We call it biological determinism.

01:11:27.732 --> 01:11:32.298
Because they're not supposed to determine your heart attacks and your susceptibility to asthma and everything else.

01:11:32.318 --> 01:11:32.739
Yeah.

01:11:32.859 --> 01:11:33.920
Only it doesn't.

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.241
Yeah.

01:11:34.261 --> 01:11:42.251
And that's why I think it's really important to kind of like look at the ideological aspects of it as opposed to just.

01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:43.112
You absolutely have to.

01:11:43.553 --> 01:11:48.880
We're suggesting we need to stop trying to find the biologically determinate part of the DNA.

01:11:49.045 --> 01:11:57.480
I understand what we're really seeing are the effects of racial narratives based on the assumption that this exists and the subsequent racial structuring of society.

01:11:57.901 --> 01:11:58.802
Right.

01:11:58.822 --> 01:12:02.389
But that's what we're really seeing the effects of, not some piece of the DNA.

01:12:02.589 --> 01:12:03.811
Yes, exactly.

01:12:04.352 --> 01:12:05.274
So that's where we are.

01:12:05.514 --> 01:12:07.257
Okay, I'm glad I got that on here.

01:12:07.418 --> 01:12:11.144
All right, I'm going to go ahead and end this then.

01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:12.066
Thank you.
