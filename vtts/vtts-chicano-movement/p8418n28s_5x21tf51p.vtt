WEBVTT

00:00.436 --> 00:05.563
Okay, we're getting ready.

00:07.546 --> 00:11.031
So today is April 29th, I believe.

00:12.973 --> 00:13.073
Yeah.

00:13.093 --> 00:14.175
And we're here.

00:14.555 --> 00:15.877
Oh, I forgot.

00:15.917 --> 00:21.024
Okay, so tell me your name and age.

00:23.187 --> 00:23.828
My...

00:25.411 --> 00:55.350
formal name or my name my common name is lily alvarez i'm 70 years old okay you're gonna have to talk a little bit louder oh almost i'm 69 and three quarters okay and then uh where were you born i was born in woodlake california and you lived in california your whole life yes okay

00:55.921 --> 01:08.001
And then can you tell me a little bit about your participation in the Chicano movement?

01:08.241 --> 01:17.857
I was raised in Kern County starting probably when I was 10 or 11.

01:19.059 --> 01:20.241
So my

01:21.706 --> 01:25.330
My high school years are in Kern County.

01:26.191 --> 01:34.841
I remember the grape strike breaking out in the mid sixties, early sixties.

01:35.321 --> 01:39.626
I would have been in either middle school or high school.

01:40.147 --> 01:46.173
I remember my family, my parents were like, yuck.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.456
I don't know what that's all about.

01:49.448 --> 01:58.279
My grandparents seemed to be supportive of the farm workers' movement.

01:59.941 --> 02:03.666
I had a couple of uncles that were labor contractors.

02:04.447 --> 02:05.288
Which uncles?

02:06.149 --> 02:14.460
So that would have been my Aunt Virginia's husband, my Aunt

02:15.875 --> 02:45.493
chavela's husband um they were labor contractors they were labor contractors yeah so what does that mean well that means that they that they uh would recruit farm workers they would house them they would take them they would be in contract with ranchers and farmers

02:45.929 --> 02:51.515
So they were not necessarily farm workers themselves or at that time period?

02:51.535 --> 02:52.556
No, they weren't.

02:52.596 --> 02:53.917
They were the contractors.

02:53.977 --> 02:56.039
So kind of like the middleman, the middleman.

02:56.300 --> 02:56.700
Yeah.

02:56.760 --> 03:08.032
Attracting the recruiting, the workers, keeping the workers in line, getting them to work, providing transportation, some housing.

03:08.052 --> 03:14.839
So with that kind of background, I remember there a lot of strife within the family.

03:15.224 --> 03:34.008
where my younger aunts, who were both college students at Fresno State, they'd come home on Sundays and then they'd have this big breakout of fighting over the politics of workers.

03:35.410 --> 03:42.919
So in the midst of all that, I think I was very ambivalent, to say the least, that I really didn't know

03:43.237 --> 03:45.119
I didn't understand what was going on.

03:45.459 --> 03:51.924
But this is more, you're talking more in terms of the labor strike, like the UFW stuff.

03:52.245 --> 03:53.125
Yeah, yeah.

03:53.145 --> 04:00.171
So I eventually, I had always been raised to, that I was supposed to get an education.

04:00.231 --> 04:05.195
So I went, after high school, I went to Bakersfield College.

04:06.577 --> 04:09.919
And then from Bakersfield College, I went to San Jose State.

04:10.079 --> 04:13.142
And San Jose State was the first time that I was become

04:13.645 --> 04:16.929
politically conscious of what was going on.

04:17.070 --> 04:22.978
At that time, a lot of Vietnam protests.

04:23.278 --> 04:28.185
I remember being in San Francisco for one of the marches.

04:28.425 --> 04:30.969
There was a million people in the streets.

04:31.169 --> 04:35.074
I mean, it was huge, these marches.

04:35.735 --> 04:42.184
And I went because one of my fellow students encouraged me to go to

04:44.088 --> 04:46.591
to go to that march.

04:47.131 --> 04:53.098
So I went, I don't even know who I went with or how I got there.

04:53.138 --> 04:54.419
I can't remember.

04:54.479 --> 04:55.660
That was so long ago.

04:56.441 --> 05:04.830
But I remember seeing just millions, I mean, just thousands and thousands of people, thousands.

05:05.351 --> 05:08.314
They said it was a million people at that march.

05:10.676 --> 05:13.099
I was going to San Jose State.

05:14.041 --> 05:19.306
And actually, to be quite honest, I was probably homesick.

05:21.388 --> 05:26.393
My aunt Lupe at that time now was living in San Juan Batista.

05:26.533 --> 05:31.118
So I would go and I would visit.

05:31.298 --> 05:34.381
I would help her to take care of her little baby.

05:35.783 --> 05:39.306
And more and more, I started getting involved watching what the

05:40.332 --> 05:43.236
what the Teatro was doing, Teatro Campesino.

05:43.256 --> 05:46.341
And I remember the first time I saw a play.

05:48.384 --> 05:53.210
I think it was, I don't think it was BernabÃ©, I think it was Soldado Rosso.

05:54.192 --> 05:58.238
But it was a slice of life play.

05:58.438 --> 06:06.930
It's about a family and the sun going off to the Vietnam War.

06:08.108 --> 06:22.943
And I remember sitting there in the audience and seeing this image of a family that looked like mine, a family whose dynamics were like mine.

06:24.864 --> 06:35.635
And it was the first time that I had seen my people, my life experience

06:36.205 --> 06:58.315
dramatized in something bigger than just life and so it it it woke me up to wanting to be part of something bigger than myself and at that time you know i was doing well in in in college and i was

06:58.582 --> 07:12.275
in my last semester to finish college, and I dropped out with nine units to complete my BA so that I could join the teatro and go with them to Mexico City.

07:13.556 --> 07:15.478
And what year is this happening?

07:15.518 --> 07:18.861
So you talked about you were, you transferred?

07:19.021 --> 07:21.803
73, 74, something in there.

07:22.064 --> 07:27.829
So you transferred from Bakersfield College to San Jose State in 1973?

07:28.383 --> 07:30.826
Probably, no, even earlier than that.

07:30.966 --> 07:31.767
So what time?

07:31.787 --> 07:31.847
71.

07:31.867 --> 07:35.131
71, you think.

07:35.151 --> 07:37.254
So I would have left Kern County in 71.

07:38.976 --> 07:50.570
So you were in 1971, you went to San Jose State, and about this time is the same time you went to that anti-war protest.

07:50.590 --> 07:50.830
Mm-hmm.

07:51.198 --> 07:53.060
72, something like that.

07:53.521 --> 07:53.621
Yeah.

07:53.641 --> 08:00.430
So between 1971 and 1973 is when all this was kind of like bubbling up.

08:00.470 --> 08:00.991
Right, right.

08:01.151 --> 08:06.438
I remember people on campus talking about bilingual and bicultural.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.283
And I was like, what the hell is that?

08:10.423 --> 08:15.470
I'd never heard these terms, you know, what it meant to be.

08:15.490 --> 08:17.052
I knew what bilingual meant.

08:17.453 --> 08:20.657
That meant that you could speak two languages.

08:20.677 --> 08:20.817
Mm-hmm.

08:21.691 --> 08:24.996
And I was like, what the hell is bicultural?

08:25.437 --> 08:26.719
What does that mean?

08:26.839 --> 08:33.369
I never heard that term in my family or on the kitchen table, never heard bicultural.

08:33.970 --> 08:47.530
It took me a long time to realize that bicultural meant being able to act among whites and get along and know how to behave

08:48.134 --> 08:53.868
in my own brown family and the role that I was supposed to play in that family.

08:53.888 --> 08:56.675
That's what bicultural meant?

08:57.437 --> 09:00.765
That's how I began to interpret what bicultural meant.

09:01.006 --> 09:03.593
So kind of like maybe navigating?

09:03.973 --> 09:04.796
Yeah.

09:04.816 --> 09:05.417
Like...

09:06.359 --> 09:12.726
navigating your family life or like what your culture was within your family.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.149
And then kind of like the outside.

09:15.429 --> 09:22.397
I mean, in white, in the white community, you're, you're supposed to be, you're supposed to be verbal.

09:22.457 --> 09:25.521
You're supposed to be, you're supposed to talk.

09:25.561 --> 09:27.603
You're supposed to assert yourself.

09:28.905 --> 09:36.113
And in a, but yet when I'm at my grandmother's house or at my mom's house,

09:37.696 --> 09:41.060
That's not the role that I was supposed to play.

09:41.680 --> 09:48.528
And that to me is what I started to realize meant what was meant by being bicultural.

09:49.589 --> 09:54.134
That I could navigate successfully in both cultures.

09:54.154 --> 09:57.878
But you're saying this is your understanding of it.

09:58.179 --> 10:01.122
Because nobody was telling me what bicultural meant.

10:01.658 --> 10:05.182
So did you ever find out, like, what was... No.

10:05.362 --> 10:07.505
From an academic perspective, no.

10:09.086 --> 10:16.815
I was a history major, so I wasn't really into psychology, sociology, you know, any of those classes.

10:16.835 --> 10:25.405
I'm sure I would have learned had I been... So there was... When you talk about this term bicultural...

10:26.043 --> 10:34.893
You're saying that it was something that was just being like a term that was being thrown around, but nobody was really kind of explaining it.

10:34.913 --> 10:35.794
Correct.

10:35.814 --> 10:39.998
And so you kind of made your own interpretation of it.

10:40.018 --> 10:52.051
And it could have been that I could have asked, but being the little country bumpkin at San Jose State, I wasn't, you know, I didn't want to show how stupid I was.

10:52.312 --> 10:53.513
So I didn't help.

10:53.673 --> 10:55.375
My mouth had asked.

10:56.468 --> 10:57.569
Okay.

10:58.390 --> 11:05.879
So your original question was, when did I start getting involved in the Chicano movement?

11:05.899 --> 11:09.303
Yeah, or how did you see like your participation?

11:09.783 --> 11:12.206
Like what kind of led you?

11:12.266 --> 11:17.933
How do you see yourself as a participant of the Chicano movement, if at all?

11:18.714 --> 11:24.180
You know, so by this time now, I'm in Teatro Campesino.

11:24.920 --> 11:42.547
and participating in either the background stuff of doing bookkeeping behind the scenes, or I was actually put on stage.

11:42.567 --> 11:47.434
And all of a sudden, I found myself in marches.

11:47.920 --> 12:09.588
You know, we were being invited to come and participate in marches, to come and perform at colleges and articulating, if you will, what the issues were.

12:10.990 --> 12:16.577
And I think that's the part that I really started to learn

12:17.215 --> 12:25.323
was that you could educate lots of people through the performing arts.

12:26.545 --> 12:46.125
That you could tell a story and tell a story that people could relate to by virtue of understanding their culture, understanding what their family values were, what their family dreams were, what their

12:46.848 --> 12:49.332
what they believed in.

12:49.352 --> 13:01.791
And because we were creating, if you will, we were creating an illusion.

13:01.891 --> 13:05.416
I mean, that's what theater is, it's an illusion.

13:05.436 --> 13:13.108
And because we were the masters of that illusion, we could create heroes, we could create,

13:13.949 --> 13:16.271
We could create possibilities.

13:16.292 --> 13:20.836
We could create the accomplishments.

13:20.916 --> 13:26.983
We could create a vision.

13:29.386 --> 13:43.821
And so more and more through my association with the teatro, I saw the role that the performing arts could play.

13:44.037 --> 13:56.088
And I thought that was an important role, an important contribution because you weren't seeing Chicanos on TV.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.951
You weren't seeing Chicanos in movies.

14:00.011 --> 14:05.516
You weren't seeing Chicanos on the front page of Life magazine.

14:05.797 --> 14:09.200
And so we had to tell our own story.

14:11.862 --> 14:12.863
We had to.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.775
We had to project.

14:15.795 --> 14:34.875
So when you say that you saw that creativity of the Teatro Campesino as kind of like creating a new vision, you said that you saw that as an important contribution.

14:34.895 --> 14:41.922
And so I'm wondering, can you explain like an important contribution to what?

14:44.382 --> 15:08.922
To me, I always thought about one of the fundamental issues that we were trying to articulate in the 60s were the number of Latinos that were getting drafted into service and going to Vietnam and dying in Vietnam.

15:12.614 --> 15:17.161
And you started to realize that this was brown on brown.

15:19.124 --> 15:22.629
What was wrong with this picture?

15:24.232 --> 15:33.346
And how, and how, whatever, whatever, what's the word I want?

15:36.611 --> 15:37.592
Whatever,

15:41.065 --> 15:54.525
benefits you had being white, they were not benefits that were available to Latino kids, to Chicano kids.

15:55.327 --> 15:57.530
It's not like they could go to college.

15:57.590 --> 16:02.237
It's not like, in my own situation, Ro, I had no idea.

16:02.257 --> 16:04.761
All I knew was how to get to Bakersfield College.

16:05.402 --> 16:09.368
I had no idea how you went from a JC to a,

16:10.192 --> 16:11.333
to a four-year college.

16:11.393 --> 16:12.695
I had no idea.

16:13.215 --> 16:14.797
Lupe and Luis came to visit me.

16:14.857 --> 16:22.244
I'm living in this little tiny shack, and she asked me, what are you going to do after this semester?

16:22.284 --> 16:24.046
And I said, I don't know.

16:25.367 --> 16:26.929
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

16:27.970 --> 16:30.412
She said, don't you know how to apply for college?

16:30.612 --> 16:31.333
I said, no.

16:32.474 --> 16:38.140
She said, I'll help you, and I'll have Luis write letters of recommendation for you.

16:38.710 --> 16:41.233
I had no idea how you were supposed to apply.

16:41.814 --> 16:58.913
So if I don't even know, and my parents were pretty stable, can you imagine all those other Latino kids, all those farm worker kids who never had a chance, who didn't know how to get a student deferment, how to get out of being drafted, going to.

16:59.594 --> 17:05.981
Somebody once said that the common language after English in Vietnam was Spanish.

17:06.081 --> 17:08.464
There were so many Mexican kids

17:08.528 --> 17:09.949
that were over there.

17:10.790 --> 17:24.464
And so what we were trying to do is to raise consciousness, raise awareness that what was going on in Vietnam in and of itself was wrong.

17:24.904 --> 17:26.906
The war was wrong.

17:26.926 --> 17:27.446
Number one.

17:27.486 --> 17:32.571
Number two, it was being fought on the backs of Latino and black kids.

17:34.013 --> 17:35.194
And three,

17:36.625 --> 17:50.122
Even if those Latino and black kids could come home, they were not availed the kind of benefits that mainstream society had available to them.

17:50.783 --> 18:01.277
And so it was a matter of being able to raise that consciousness and to ask for what was rightfully ours.

18:02.538 --> 18:03.239
What was that?

18:03.640 --> 18:04.641
Which was

18:05.212 --> 18:34.729
which was to be able to express who we were, to be accepted for who we were, to be able to reap the benefits of being, you know, members of this country, of this nation, being able to get housing, to get education, to get jobs, to get...

18:34.979 --> 19:00.666
okay we're back um so what were you just talking about so you're talking about a lot of like the anti-war and kind of like trying to spread a message that this was really kind of like a brown on brown war and the war you're talking about is the vietnam war right right right right

19:00.967 --> 19:30.180
and um actually i have i have kind of like a side question about that because grandpa was in world war ii and so i'm kind of curious just maybe for my own knowledge um like what was that like being raised by somebody who was a veteran who as you already kind of stated was

19:31.105 --> 19:59.863
skeptical or unsure about the Chicano labor movement being headed by the UFW and then these kind of like expectations that you're gonna go to school but not provide you with any like tools to actually do that so I'm wondering like what are your own kind of like feelings about all that as it relates to where you ended up during that time period

20:00.282 --> 20:09.235
You know, you hear stories, Robie, about how Grandpa and I would always knock heads.

20:10.136 --> 20:13.481
We were always on different sides of the aisle.

20:14.463 --> 20:18.468
I mean, so that's what it was like, a constant battle with my dad.

20:19.049 --> 20:21.933
And over the years, I saw him.

20:23.516 --> 20:27.842
I saw him come to a realization

20:28.615 --> 20:36.526
that the Vietnam War was wrong and that we needed to get out of it.

20:37.668 --> 20:39.951
He saw the politics behind it.

20:41.293 --> 20:51.467
For as much as I was out there in the streets protesting, I wasn't really following the battles.

20:52.055 --> 20:54.920
or what was going on, whereas my dad was.

20:55.821 --> 21:12.848
My dad was following, you know, all the military decisions that were being made and got very frustrated and very angry, you know, about the political system and what was happening.

21:12.908 --> 21:17.455
So by the time we pulled out of Vietnam, he was

21:19.392 --> 21:22.535
He was pretty sour on the whole thing.

21:22.555 --> 21:31.403
So he really lost a lot of trust in government.

21:31.423 --> 21:46.497
And then when you were talking about this message of black and brown youth being drafted and sent to go fight in Vietnam,

21:47.371 --> 21:54.064
And that part of like what was wrapped into that is that I think this is what you're saying.

21:54.084 --> 22:08.772
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but that there was this kind of like part of the message that that you were picking up on or that the theater was promoting was that.

22:09.646 --> 22:17.014
You know, even as you're going out and, you know, becoming a soldier for the U.S.

22:17.174 --> 22:32.891
Army or for the United States government, that whatever benefits you might have as a soldier coming back were not given to Chicanos or black people.

22:33.732 --> 22:35.454
So is that correct?

22:35.554 --> 22:39.518
Or were you kind of mentioning that or was I making my own stuff up?

22:41.337 --> 23:01.152
um because you were talking about something about like white benefits like whatever benefits white people had like we didn't have those no matter what you know what the benefit was the the white benefit is you come back from world war ii

23:01.553 --> 23:16.275
you get some kind of a steady job, you get money, you get a house, your kids go to school, you go to school with the GI Bill, you teach your kids how to go to school with the GI Bill.

23:17.597 --> 23:23.085
Latinos, like my dad, my dad went to World War II.

23:24.347 --> 23:29.535
He came back, he wasn't, he came back to the fields.

23:29.988 --> 23:31.491
He didn't go back to school.

23:31.571 --> 23:33.495
That was one of his biggest regrets.

23:34.898 --> 23:34.998
Yeah.

23:35.018 --> 23:38.084
Is that he never took advantage of the GI Bill.

23:38.184 --> 23:45.559
And I don't... I think that what... That... I don't know whether or not it was family.

23:47.182 --> 23:50.308
It must have been a sense of...

23:50.930 --> 23:59.848
of loyalty to the family and coming back and earning to take care of the family.

23:59.868 --> 24:02.813
And, and so he never got to go to school.

24:02.894 --> 24:06.160
He never got to, you know, take advantage.

24:06.901 --> 24:10.288
It's not until my mom and dad marry.

24:10.859 --> 24:15.629
that they applied for the GI Bill for a house.

24:16.591 --> 24:17.974
Yeah, that's the first time.

24:19.438 --> 24:25.611
So he doesn't know how to teach his kids how to go to school because he didn't go to school.

24:25.711 --> 24:29.880
And so... Do you think the...

24:31.177 --> 24:40.370
I mean, so do you think maybe like part of it was that he felt obligated or tired to take care of his family when he came back?

24:40.531 --> 24:51.206
Or do you think it's also that nobody or, you know, was anybody there to say, hey, you should take advantage of this GI Bill and go to school?

24:51.427 --> 24:52.528
I don't think so.

24:52.548 --> 24:53.790
I think that was the point.

24:53.810 --> 25:00.019
There was no infrastructure for my dad or his peers, you know.

25:00.303 --> 25:09.414
on how to take advantage of, okay, look, you have these benefits, this, you know, this GI bill, but I'm talking more about white privilege.

25:10.095 --> 25:11.497
There was white privilege.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.661
There's always been white privilege.

25:14.681 --> 25:28.858
And so that's what I'm talking about when I say, you know, Latinos, I'm just articulating how it, you know, how it, how it becomes real.

25:29.345 --> 25:38.473
You know, it's one thing to say white privilege, but then it's another to describe exactly, you know, what happened.

25:38.554 --> 25:43.898
And so my dad, you know, didn't have that benefit.

25:43.919 --> 25:54.929
Are you thinking about it, like, in terms of maybe something having to do with, like, the reproduction of knowledge?

25:55.089 --> 25:57.411
So, like, are you tying that in there?

25:57.745 --> 25:59.307
Your dad didn't know what to do.

25:59.407 --> 26:01.290
He didn't know what to tell you to do.

26:02.172 --> 26:07.780
And then you ended up kind of like, okay, I'm supposed to go to school, but I don't know like what I'm doing.

26:07.900 --> 26:08.841
No, no.

26:09.262 --> 26:09.983
It was clear.

26:10.043 --> 26:24.745
My mom and dad both knew because they had seen that education seemed to be the ticket to get to a different place, a different social status.

26:24.765 --> 26:24.865
Okay.

26:24.885 --> 26:24.985
Okay.

26:25.370 --> 26:29.475
So that's why they were hammering, go to school, go to school, go to school.

26:29.495 --> 26:33.881
Yeah, but the... The mechanics of how to... That's what I'm saying.

26:34.242 --> 26:41.051
They didn't know the mechanics of how you apply for school, that there's an application process.

26:41.171 --> 26:41.672
Yeah.

26:41.692 --> 26:42.693
They didn't know that.

26:42.853 --> 26:50.263
I think they were probably hoping that I would have learned that someplace... By going to high school or something.

26:50.283 --> 26:53.267
High school, junior college...

26:53.551 --> 26:55.314
that in some way I was going to learn that.

26:56.455 --> 27:13.241
So, well, so that's what I was thinking in terms of like what you were talking about, white privilege, that that is maybe a privilege of whites is to know, like, how do you get through these different institutions?

27:13.902 --> 27:18.710
Well, the way that they learned it, whites, is that they went through it.

27:18.810 --> 27:20.773
They knew people that went through it.

27:21.344 --> 27:27.354
So you don't have the same kind of reproduction happening in your family, in your community.

27:27.514 --> 27:27.814
Right.

27:28.475 --> 27:28.796
Right.

27:29.777 --> 27:30.178
Okay.

27:30.719 --> 27:31.520
What was I going to say?

27:32.181 --> 27:42.758
Another thing that I wanted to mention, Ro, is you know how today we talk about identity politics in the sixties?

27:46.444 --> 27:48.347
I don't know about African-Americans.

27:48.783 --> 27:51.806
but I do know about Latinos.

27:51.826 --> 27:55.110
We didn't have an identity.

27:55.210 --> 28:01.757
We knew we had come from Mexico.

28:02.838 --> 28:08.485
We wanted to be American, so we settled with this term called Mexican-American.

28:09.746 --> 28:16.073
It isn't until we start protesting

28:17.437 --> 28:23.545
that we come to identify ourselves as Chicano.

28:24.326 --> 28:39.225
And I think that at the same time, you're seeing Native American, with AIM, you see Black Panthers, you see different African-American

28:40.640 --> 28:47.310
coalitions, students, white students, progressive students.

28:47.931 --> 28:56.063
So you see people starting to formulate an identity.

28:56.083 --> 29:06.478
Up until then, our identity was defined by someone else, by movie makers, by television.

29:07.370 --> 29:15.680
by magazines, by mass media, somebody else was, and didn't have any idea of who we were.

29:18.083 --> 29:28.536
And so I see, so when people talk about identity politics today, I think about, you know what?

29:29.458 --> 29:33.883
We helped to create identity and it was not a bad thing.

29:34.454 --> 29:49.416
I remember that after the Vietnam War, the teatro moved into more cultural kinds of plays, productions.

29:52.981 --> 29:59.871
We were the first ones to bring Azteca dancers into California, into the United States.

30:00.560 --> 30:07.429
we were the first ones to begin celebrating Dia de los Muertos.

30:08.690 --> 30:22.227
We were the first ones to start producing images of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

30:22.968 --> 30:28.255
I mean, those kinds of, and so now what we're doing is saying, hey,

30:29.602 --> 30:32.945
Chicanos, we come, we have a history.

30:32.965 --> 30:37.129
We have, we have roots.

30:37.249 --> 30:47.598
We have, you know, we have, we have an identity that, that we're going to, we're going to promote for ourselves.

30:48.559 --> 30:50.500
And that's where you start seeing that.

30:51.181 --> 30:52.182
And I think, what do you feel?

30:52.262 --> 30:57.887
I think African-Americans were always two or three steps ahead of

30:58.576 --> 30:59.317
Latinos.

30:59.357 --> 31:05.182
I mean, they're just, you know, they have more generations of being educated here in the United States.

31:06.123 --> 31:11.648
You know, they had... When did the Vietnam War end?

31:12.168 --> 31:14.550
Probably, I want to say 74, 75.

31:14.630 --> 31:26.541
So, according to you, most of what the teatro was doing was kind of just

31:27.213 --> 31:30.376
Trying to spread a message, like an anti-war message.

31:30.616 --> 31:35.881
That and the, what do you call it, remember that the grape strikes are going on at the same time.

31:35.901 --> 31:38.704
So a labor and anti-war message, maybe.

31:39.605 --> 31:53.297
And then once that kind of died down or settled or ended or whatever, that's when the teatro and that's when you guys all really kind of jumped on this more cultural message.

31:53.317 --> 31:56.140
And what do you think, why do you think that happened?

31:56.457 --> 32:24.473
then like what do you was it just okay we don't have anything else to talk about or or spread a message about so now we're gonna focus on this thing or do you think it was there the whole time and these other issues were maybe more at the center or at the forefront i think what do you call it how do you think that happened i think that um

32:25.921 --> 32:29.326
for example, images of the Virgen de Guadalupe.

32:29.686 --> 32:38.358
I mean, if you look at the labor movement and you see Caesar and you see the marches, you see banners of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

32:38.398 --> 32:45.148
You see her as, you know, as the patron saint of campesinos.

32:45.168 --> 32:47.651
And so she was always there.

32:49.254 --> 32:51.837
That's part of, you can identify.

32:52.278 --> 32:54.561
You know, when you see that, you go, oh,

32:55.570 --> 32:57.072
That's where I belong.

32:59.396 --> 33:00.618
And why was that?

33:01.419 --> 33:02.621
Well, let's see.

33:03.543 --> 33:07.169
Blonde, blue eye on the 16 magazine.

33:08.391 --> 33:09.212
That's not me.

33:10.795 --> 33:12.077
Virgen de Guadalupe.

33:12.177 --> 33:16.143
I think I've seen her a lot of times in church when I used to go with grandma.

33:16.924 --> 33:20.310
I think I belong over here.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.894
So the church, the church is...

33:23.313 --> 33:50.772
promotion of the virgen is what made you recognize that as as some kind of cultural symbol for you no it's not that what do you call it it's um i know that when we started the production of the virgen they were i mean all part of part of mounting a play

33:51.798 --> 33:58.427
includes, if you will, like a learning process, or it was in the teatro.

33:58.447 --> 34:05.677
And I remember that Estruiz would be creating a play.

34:05.697 --> 34:16.111
He'd be walking through, he'd be almost like whatever he was reading and absorbing, he was also teaching us.

34:16.131 --> 34:21.619
And so this is where we begin to learn

34:22.510 --> 34:29.597
So that experience in and of itself was so, what do you call it, so dynamic.

34:29.617 --> 34:48.957
And so what you had was you had a period of education that was going on where we were starting to learn

34:51.704 --> 34:56.891
We were starting to learn more and more about our own Mexican history.

34:57.592 --> 35:07.185
And I remember, Robbie, think about Matias being six months old or three months old in that passport picture.

35:07.225 --> 35:11.991
That passport picture is because we're going to travel to Chile.

35:12.275 --> 35:17.720
just before Allende was, there was a curita on there, and they assassinated.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.101
Did they assassinate him?

35:19.762 --> 35:21.623
I think so.

35:23.125 --> 35:40.020
We were starting to do more and more, well, we'll call it international, but it really was intercontinental, because it was more and more invitations to go to Mexico City, to go to Mexico and perform.

35:40.270 --> 36:09.670
performances now we were venturing into Latin America I think in the early years of the teatro when they were associated with the farm workers there was a pull toward Europe because I remember the teatro going to Europe performing and now what you saw was more of a pull toward Latin America Mexico Central America

36:10.021 --> 36:12.543
So dad was in it before you were in it?

36:12.563 --> 36:12.803
Yes.

36:13.264 --> 36:14.585
Oh, okay.

36:14.605 --> 36:14.705
Yeah.

36:14.725 --> 36:20.951
He was in it when he was at Fresno State, and I didn't come in until when I went to San Jose State.

36:21.511 --> 36:24.354
So they had already relocated to San Juan.

36:25.374 --> 36:27.556
He came from Fresno to San Juan.

36:29.458 --> 36:35.203
So there was now more of a pull.

36:35.784 --> 36:39.707
I think it was becoming more international, becoming more...

36:40.733 --> 36:51.085
The teatro and Luis and his visualizing of where he wanted to see the teatro move toward.

36:52.447 --> 37:06.623
Why were there invitations, international invitations, whether it was Europe or Latin America?

37:09.893 --> 37:20.246
The art form in and of itself, there was Comedia del Arte is what it was called.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.830
And it was an art form.

37:25.152 --> 37:30.298
And I think because I remember going to New York

37:31.510 --> 37:37.176
and these different theater companies wanting to be in our presence.

37:37.256 --> 37:41.881
Look at even Peter, what's his name, Peter?

37:43.343 --> 37:44.064
Peter Fonda?

37:44.764 --> 37:52.032
No, the director from the Royal Shakespearean Theater.

37:52.052 --> 37:59.020
I mean, they wanted to come and spend a month with Teatro Campesino because the art form in and of itself was so

38:00.181 --> 38:02.764
On the one hand, it was unique.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.607
On the other hand, it was steeped in tradition.

38:06.968 --> 38:21.423
And that art form was one of out in the open, not within a proscenium stage, you know, where you've got a stage and then you have a theater.

38:22.304 --> 38:22.604
Okay.

38:22.984 --> 38:24.386
That's proscenium stage.

38:24.826 --> 38:26.728
Now you were doing theater.

38:27.400 --> 38:31.684
Out in the open, open air theater, okay?

38:31.704 --> 38:33.726
And you were doing political theater.

38:35.068 --> 38:42.175
And so that art form was what was attracting, if you will.

38:43.777 --> 38:55.669
Either other people wanted to be like what we were doing or they were doing what we were doing and wanted to interface with.

38:56.240 --> 39:01.605
with other colleagues that were doing this kind of theater.

39:03.907 --> 39:25.285
So one of the things my dad was talking about when I did my interview with him was how he thought of, and a lot of this is coming up in what you're talking about or what you've mentioned, but my dad was saying how he saw the work of the teatro as propaganda.

39:26.075 --> 39:26.495
Right.

39:26.636 --> 39:35.325
That there was a message that you guys were trying to put out there and it was, you know, it was a good way of doing that and blah, blah, blah, blah.

39:35.645 --> 39:52.603
Do you think that like that was what was like new and unique about it is that there was some kind of like accessible message to what you guys were doing or because I'm trying to think like what would be the difference?

39:52.623 --> 39:55.626
Like most theater has some kind of message to it.

39:56.365 --> 39:57.947
Like, why was this different?

39:58.709 --> 40:02.895
Well, there's a little bit of a tangent.

40:04.237 --> 40:09.705
You know that your cousin, Amelia, and Melinda are always doing theater.

40:09.785 --> 40:10.506
They're in theater.

40:11.268 --> 40:13.711
And I learned from Ron Davis.

40:13.831 --> 40:16.676
Ron Davis was with the San Francisco Meme Troupe.

40:17.397 --> 40:21.844
And he was actually Luis's mentor.

40:21.864 --> 40:22.625
Yeah.

40:22.645 --> 40:22.845
Okay.

40:23.635 --> 40:42.424
And he once told me when they were just building the Center for Performing Arts there in San Jose, and they were starting to produce, you know, Music Man, Oklahoma, all of those stages, all of those kinds of plays.

40:42.444 --> 40:48.934
He said, you know when a community is becoming middle class, when they start

40:51.091 --> 41:14.179
delivering this type of theater because it is this type of theater that puts the masses to sleep they no longer are thinking about social justice and so what what you see in commercial theater what you see in commercial theater is people

41:14.986 --> 41:16.368
Like just entertainment.

41:16.408 --> 41:18.010
Just being entertained.

41:18.211 --> 41:23.979
And then this other kind of theater is like maybe kind of a call to action or something.

41:23.999 --> 41:24.440
Correct.

41:24.460 --> 41:26.123
Okay.

41:26.163 --> 41:26.403
Okay.

41:26.603 --> 41:41.786
And then, okay, so let's get back to, well, let me step one or take one step back because the other thing you mentioned was how being in the teatro was kind of like a different form of education.

41:41.806 --> 41:42.647
You talked about

41:43.066 --> 41:50.537
Like Luis would be doing some kind of research or get into some kind of topic and then he would share with you guys what he learned.

41:51.439 --> 41:51.559
Right.

41:51.579 --> 42:05.600
And so I think, I mean, I think that's something else to maybe add to the kind of collective that you guys had because it wasn't just a teatro, it was a community, right?

42:05.620 --> 42:05.800
Yeah.

42:06.269 --> 42:11.295
And then that takes us back to the Virgen de Guadalupe, right?

42:11.836 --> 42:29.998
So prior to that little sidebar, we were talking about the Virgen, and you were saying how, you know, during the UFW march, that that was kind of a symbol that convinced you, yeah, the Farm Workers Union, right?

42:30.586 --> 42:36.476
that that was an image that kind of convinced you like, this is the side that I'm supposed to be on.

42:37.658 --> 42:49.538
Um, because it was something, not only does the beat hand look like you, but it's something that you were familiar with from your past through going to church or whatever else.

42:50.160 --> 42:50.460
Right.

42:50.500 --> 42:56.290
So I kind of, I think I wanted to know a little bit more about where

42:58.379 --> 43:01.462
Like, was that kind of the only area?

43:01.622 --> 43:07.609
Was your family, did your family have like the virgen in their houses?

43:07.669 --> 43:16.178
Like what was the connection between the virgen and like your familiarity with it?

43:17.880 --> 43:18.700
Do you know what I'm saying?

43:19.541 --> 43:20.082
You know what?

43:20.262 --> 43:25.888
It's, it, it wasn't personal to me.

43:26.847 --> 43:30.130
I know that my grandmother was a Guadalupana.

43:31.712 --> 43:32.593
Victoriana?

43:33.354 --> 43:33.894
Yeah.

43:33.914 --> 43:49.010
So they had church groups, social groups, and she happened to be part of the social group that was dedicated to the patron saint.

43:49.650 --> 43:50.832
They were Catholic, right?

43:50.852 --> 43:51.072
Yes.

43:51.672 --> 43:54.255
And grandpa's parents were not Catholic, right?

43:55.265 --> 43:59.790
They were originally Catholic, and then they became apostolic in the mid-30s.

44:01.632 --> 44:02.152
Do you know why?

44:02.313 --> 44:03.334
Do you know what?

44:03.354 --> 44:04.855
No.

44:04.875 --> 44:06.818
I don't know what happened there.

44:06.918 --> 44:07.198
What way?

44:07.218 --> 44:07.578
How?

44:07.598 --> 44:10.021
So it's not that I, what do you call it?

44:10.041 --> 44:17.409
It's not that I, I mean, you know, I'd go to mass and I would see a, you know, a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

44:17.489 --> 44:21.053
I knew my grandmother was a Guadalupe, and she had her little,

44:21.438 --> 44:30.467
her little pin, that we would go to Jamaica's when I was little, you know, and it was the Hualegupana Society that put on the Jamaica.

44:31.769 --> 44:45.623
So, you know, it, but it wasn't like, I'm, you know, I'm a, and it isn't until, it isn't until we start working on, on that play

44:46.126 --> 44:54.021
And it's not so much Our Lady of Guadalupe, but rather the indigenous side of the story.

44:55.123 --> 45:02.437
It's really that, you know, what we start learning about is Juan Diego.

45:02.577 --> 45:04.962
We start learning about how

45:05.043 --> 45:15.011
Where she appeared had been previously a site that had a pyramid on it, Tepeyac.

45:16.413 --> 45:25.100
It was her speaking, Nahuatl, and her speaking in that Indian tongue.

45:25.120 --> 45:30.404
What the symbolism was on her clothing.

45:31.706 --> 45:34.628
You know, the color of her cape.

45:35.384 --> 45:57.527
the images on her little pink dress, how she was standing on that moon, what that moon meant, all of those symbols and their indigenous, their Indian meaning.

45:58.520 --> 46:04.848
And is that something, like that whole story, is that something that you learned by being in the teatro?

46:05.048 --> 46:05.148
Yeah.

46:05.168 --> 46:05.849
Okay.

46:05.869 --> 46:06.089
Yeah.

46:06.109 --> 46:09.653
So nothing like when you were in church, they didn't tell you about all that?

46:09.713 --> 46:10.174
No, no, no.

46:10.214 --> 46:12.997
Your parents didn't tell you anything about that?

46:13.017 --> 46:13.858
No, no, no.

46:13.878 --> 46:19.325
So it was that being involved in the teatro that you learned about that stuff.

46:19.345 --> 46:19.585
Interesting.

46:20.687 --> 46:21.928
Interesting.

46:22.853 --> 46:24.516
And that's all part of that.

46:24.556 --> 46:29.623
Like I said, it's all that part of developing, if you will, an identity.

46:31.466 --> 46:44.546
And grasping onto, if you will, oh, holy shit, you know, we're part of a history of indigenous people that have been here for millennia.

46:45.588 --> 46:51.156
We've been, you know, we have a culture, we have a philosophy, we have a...

46:51.777 --> 46:58.246
What was that like to be, so let's see, how old were you?

46:58.266 --> 47:00.609
You were like in your early 20s, right?

47:00.749 --> 47:01.130
Yeah.

47:02.932 --> 47:15.068
And so prior to really kind of being involved in the teatro, your family was pretty straight-laced, it sounds like.

47:15.489 --> 47:20.856
Like not very, I mean, I don't want to say, and correct me if I'm wrong, but

47:21.275 --> 47:24.019
They don't seem very like community involved.

47:24.099 --> 47:25.100
No, they're not.

47:25.120 --> 47:30.087
So they kind of like keep to themselves, they keep to their own family, take care of each other.

47:30.167 --> 47:35.394
But the broader community is like not right, not super important for them.

47:35.455 --> 47:51.096
So what was that like to be kind of like raised in that kind of community that was very kind of like closed in?

47:51.970 --> 48:14.265
and without a lot of information about who you are and where you guys come from to then being part of this other community that is now like giving you this information about like who your people are this broader community of people and and your connections and

48:14.515 --> 48:21.084
And just giving you this, this newer kind of information, like what was that like to go from that?

48:21.104 --> 48:22.406
I was a sponge.

48:22.706 --> 48:24.829
I was like a student.

48:24.849 --> 48:26.151
I was like learning.

48:27.272 --> 48:28.634
So it was pretty exciting.

48:29.315 --> 48:30.176
Exciting.

48:30.717 --> 48:39.088
Um, what about, well, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I mean, was there like a sense of empowerment, like.

48:39.760 --> 48:52.854
Because the way you were kind of talking about your, your earlier life was like, all I see are like these white people in the media on the magazines and like, it was humbling.

48:53.034 --> 48:53.755
It was humbling.

48:53.835 --> 49:07.810
It wasn't, um, you know, I was, I was not the first, but the second year of production, I got to be the, I got to play the video and, um,

49:09.832 --> 49:24.013
I remember coming off stage and, you know, people are like, oh, and I'm like, uh, like, don't look at me.

49:24.033 --> 49:24.133
Yeah.

49:24.153 --> 49:25.295
I'm very, what do you call it?

49:25.315 --> 49:28.960
I'm humbled by, it's not me.

49:29.541 --> 49:39.636
I'm, and I don't know if that's my, if that's just a, a, a character,

49:40.831 --> 50:09.488
flaw that i have you know that i can't accept you know any kind of i don't think so but i remember feeling i'm rolling my eyes right now but i really felt like i was not supposed to take credit for them or something yeah i felt like it was pretty it was pretty spectacular pretty spiritual

50:10.312 --> 50:12.014
But the whole, what do you call it?

50:12.034 --> 50:14.898
The whole learning process, Ro?

50:15.639 --> 50:23.950
The whole learning process was, like I said, you're like a sponge.

50:24.331 --> 50:26.493
You're just taking all of this in.

50:27.415 --> 50:29.177
You're learning about this stuff.

50:29.538 --> 50:35.666
I mean, I wasn't going to, I remember Luis reading El Popol Vuh.

50:37.308 --> 50:39.711
I was never going to read El Popol Vuh.

50:40.366 --> 50:46.372
Okay, that's one of the few Mayan books that were not burned.

50:47.914 --> 50:53.540
And it's, I don't know how thick it is, and I don't know what kind of Spanish.

50:55.041 --> 51:09.917
I wasn't ever going to read that, but I was really grateful that they could teach us out of that book, you know, some of the terms and some of the, you know, some of the concepts, some of these Mayan concepts.

51:10.235 --> 51:13.459
And then to have the opportunity to meet people.

51:14.300 --> 51:25.094
I mean, I remember going to Mexico City on my own and staying with one of the danzantes.

51:26.476 --> 51:28.859
His name was Andres Segura.

51:30.681 --> 51:38.892
And meeting a Mayan philosophy teacher that taught at the University of Mexico.

51:39.901 --> 52:06.162
who literally sat me down and taught me the mysteries, if you will, of the Aztec calendar and how the Aztec calendar and the number sequence are all related to our physical bodies.

52:07.373 --> 52:15.481
And you walk away from there going, oh, holy shit, this whole cosmic thing is like real.

52:16.962 --> 52:19.244
You're just like, were you doing drugs?

52:19.925 --> 52:21.326
I wasn't doing drugs.

52:21.406 --> 52:23.028
I wasn't doing drugs.

52:23.148 --> 52:27.632
I was like, holy shit.

52:29.654 --> 52:31.616
Yeah, so it was very exciting.

52:31.696 --> 52:33.398
It was a very exciting thing.

52:36.415 --> 52:38.838
But not empowering yet.

52:38.858 --> 52:40.300
You know what?

52:40.320 --> 52:51.236
It isn't until I'm in my 30s that I begin to realize a certain power that I have.

52:52.538 --> 52:55.181
And in my 40s, I really started using it.

52:55.321 --> 52:57.645
And by my 50s, I was like cruising.

52:58.506 --> 52:58.666
Yeah.

52:58.947 --> 52:59.267
Yeah.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.067
Interesting.

53:02.548 --> 53:24.883
Okay, so you would say that your connection or relationship with the Chicano movement was as a member of Teatro Campesino and being kind of a participant in that.

53:26.197 --> 53:39.033
But what I'm hearing is that you're not necessarily a leader, but maybe somebody who is more kind of in the background.

53:39.113 --> 53:39.934
A foot soldier.

53:40.334 --> 53:43.238
A foot soldier, okay.

53:46.261 --> 53:53.470
And I guess maybe this kind of goes back to this question that I have next about...

53:53.686 --> 54:01.355
when did you see or understand the movement, the Chicano movement, as being a movement?

54:01.375 --> 54:23.220
And I know you kind of talked about the UFW march, but was there any point in time maybe between that and then in the 1970s or close to mid-1970s where you felt like, oh, we got a movement going on here?

54:24.027 --> 54:25.509
There's a Chicano movement.

54:26.350 --> 54:28.193
Or was that like not really?

54:28.513 --> 54:30.416
I remember there was a march in LA.

54:31.477 --> 54:32.839
The Chicano moratorium?

54:33.180 --> 54:33.440
Yeah.

54:33.881 --> 54:35.763
I remember, what do you call it?

54:35.783 --> 54:38.327
All I remember is that I got new tennis shoes.

54:38.367 --> 54:40.550
It was the first time I ever bought Nikes.

54:41.090 --> 54:42.472
And they were awesome.

54:42.492 --> 54:47.720
I was able to walk the entire distance and it didn't bother me to walk.

54:48.761 --> 54:50.203
Remember I had a bad back.

54:50.538 --> 54:53.641
That was always fragile when it came to my back.

54:53.702 --> 54:55.303
So this was a big deal.

54:55.343 --> 55:06.336
And just like in San Francisco where there were millions, there was a million people on Geary Street.

55:06.496 --> 55:14.605
I remember standing there and looking up Geary and it was like, it was wall to wall.

55:15.732 --> 55:22.641
You know how we saw last night Game of Thrones and you saw those thousands of soldiers?

55:22.702 --> 55:23.783
There were thousands.

55:23.823 --> 55:33.076
And so in the Chicano moratorium, that march, what you saw were hundreds of thousands.

55:34.157 --> 55:37.201
So you went to that as well?

55:37.221 --> 55:38.383
When was that, 1971?

55:38.623 --> 55:40.626
I don't even remember anymore.

55:42.614 --> 55:44.677
So you were there in L.A.

55:44.897 --> 55:46.660
Did you get beat up?

55:46.680 --> 55:49.043
No.

55:49.224 --> 55:53.750
No, no, no, no, no, no.

55:53.770 --> 55:53.910
No.

55:54.171 --> 55:54.952
Let's see.

55:55.072 --> 56:00.520
Is there anything else about... Excuse me.

56:00.941 --> 56:02.062
Can I do interviews?

56:02.082 --> 56:03.204
No, go away.

56:04.125 --> 56:05.547
I'm recording.

56:05.567 --> 56:11.676
Now you're going to be in my recording.

56:13.040 --> 56:39.030
um okay so we couldn't talked about that chicago movement stuff and then the teatro campesino and then okay um

56:39.871 --> 56:48.039
So the next thing I want to ask you is about this idea of mestizaje.

56:49.420 --> 56:52.743
So you know that that's what I'm working on for my project.

56:54.165 --> 57:09.760
And I kind of wanted to ask you if you were familiar with that, if you are familiar with that term, and what you maybe know about it or how you understand it.

57:19.139 --> 57:31.535
Around the kitchen table, Robie, when we were kids, the Saturday mornings were really special because it was the first time that we got to sit down with my mom and dad.

57:32.056 --> 57:37.503
My dad was always either dinner time, just got off the table.

57:38.665 --> 57:40.447
He was, you know, he had worked all day.

57:41.348 --> 57:48.117
Saturdays gave us the opportunity to be with my dad

57:49.936 --> 57:58.008
And it's like we were little kids, like stars, stargazing.

57:58.028 --> 58:05.358
We were, you know, we just admired my dad and we always, you know, hung to every word, or I did anyway.

58:05.378 --> 58:07.040
I don't know about my other siblings.

58:09.264 --> 58:16.614
So the conversation would always, you know, what happened in school, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

58:17.455 --> 58:18.677
And invariably,

58:19.315 --> 58:31.453
We would always get to this place where my dad would say to us, don't forget that you are mestizo.

58:31.473 --> 58:35.839
You are part European, you're part Indian.

58:37.442 --> 58:41.347
And that we come from a long line of Aztec.

58:42.829 --> 58:48.057
I guess he said Aztec because my grandfather was from Toluca.

58:48.526 --> 58:53.571
which is right by Mexico City.

58:55.432 --> 59:17.773
But he would tell us to always be proud that we could never take that away and that we should never be ashamed of being brown and to have a lot of, what do you call it, and to have a lot of pride in who we were.

59:18.310 --> 59:21.555
not to feel sorry for ourselves that we were brown.

59:22.596 --> 59:24.539
I mean, that would be his message.

59:24.559 --> 59:37.198
And we would, you know, kind of like, you know, we were, you know, we would get off the table and we'd feel good about ourselves.

59:37.318 --> 59:39.221
We were, you know, we were proud.

59:40.623 --> 59:45.330
So being mestizo was not, was not a,

59:47.015 --> 59:49.397
was not a, what's the word I want?

59:50.018 --> 59:52.380
A mystery to me.

59:52.400 --> 59:53.602
Not like bicultural.

59:53.682 --> 59:56.344
Nobody ever talked about being bicultural.

59:56.365 --> 59:57.666
But mestizo they did.

59:57.746 --> 59:59.027
But mestizo they did.

59:59.087 --> 01:00:00.969
My dad was very, what do you call it?

01:00:02.251 --> 01:00:03.272
And it was my dad.

01:00:03.352 --> 01:00:04.413
It was not my mom.

01:00:04.473 --> 01:00:09.338
It was my dad that would tell us, you know, that we were mestizo.

01:00:09.358 --> 01:00:13.562
So when I started hearing the term mestizo,

01:00:14.285 --> 01:00:17.249
It was not an unfamiliar term.

01:00:17.269 --> 01:00:20.092
I knew what that meant to be mestizo.

01:00:21.314 --> 01:00:42.300
And so I saw that playing out with different plays that we were doing, with different, you know, the symbols

01:00:43.158 --> 01:00:52.628
like we say that the Virgen de Guadalupe is synonymous with the farm workers movement, right?

01:00:52.648 --> 01:01:04.019
And that symbol, it was a symbol of being indigenous and being European.

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:06.562
But it was, what do you call it?

01:01:06.642 --> 01:01:09.705
It was something that you identified with.

01:01:11.879 --> 01:01:27.899
So you see it incorporated, you know, in the... And I think because Luis saw that, Roby, you know, he was with the farm workers and, you know, that early work that they did with the octos.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:34.006
I mean, he saw how the virgen played a role with the farm workers.

01:01:34.467 --> 01:01:39.793
He wasn't stupid, so he knew that he could incorporate those kinds of

01:01:40.448 --> 01:01:53.082
those kinds of symbols that would then trigger, if you will, a nonverbal response, an emotional response.

01:01:59.109 --> 01:02:08.059
And so when we start doing more deliberate cultural kinds of productions,

01:02:10.317 --> 01:02:14.141
They are intended.

01:02:15.082 --> 01:02:17.125
They were deliberate.

01:02:18.486 --> 01:02:28.998
They were deliberate pulls of who we are as a people.

01:02:29.018 --> 01:02:37.708
Can I ask you, because you brought up the Vidhin again, and you were talking about how the Vidhin is a symbol of

01:02:37.992 --> 01:02:43.097
indigenous and European or that mestizo symbol, right?

01:02:43.197 --> 01:02:49.944
How do you see or how do you understand those two, the indigenous and European aspects of the Viten?

01:02:54.709 --> 01:02:57.772
I think, I mean, we kind of talked about the indigenous connections.

01:02:58.153 --> 01:03:00.055
Right, right, right, right.

01:03:00.075 --> 01:03:06.261
So what do you see as being, what do you see as that image or that symbol's connection to Europe?

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:15.928
She's there as a symbol to identify the oppression that's going on.

01:03:15.948 --> 01:03:28.480
And she's saying her message to Juan Diego, go tell the archbishop, go tell the obispo to build a temple here.

01:03:31.663 --> 01:03:35.927
Not on Fifth Street, here on Tepeyac.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:49.966
which meant, which meant put it, put it right here where, where my indigenous people have always come to honor their goddesses.

01:03:50.747 --> 01:03:51.507
Okay.

01:03:51.527 --> 01:04:03.079
So in some ways she is she's this manifestation with power

01:04:04.612 --> 01:04:12.202
over the European, because, I mean, clearly the Catholic Church is coming from Europe.

01:04:14.045 --> 01:04:17.430
The oppression is coming from Europe.

01:04:19.152 --> 01:04:31.930
And so it is almost, she's almost symbolizing a victory over the oppressor in some ways.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:32.931
So if

01:04:34.362 --> 01:04:39.249
Okay, I just want to clarify because I think I might be a little confused.

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:49.684
So first off, you talked about grandpa mentioning that you guys are Mestizo, you're indigenous and European, right?

01:04:50.665 --> 01:05:03.964
And then when you're talking about the Virgen de Guadalupe as being this Mestizo image, it sounds like you're talking about that in a different way of this

01:05:04.298 --> 01:05:27.436
this clash between indigenous and European, that it's not that she is those things at the same time, but that she's indigenous and she is in some way speaking to the power of the European, whether it's oppression, whether it's spiritual domination, whatever.

01:05:27.497 --> 01:05:29.580
So do you see like,

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:50.669
where there's a little bit of like, I'm not seeing like, I don't know, or maybe you can just kind of like clarify what you mean by that, because on the one hand, when you're telling the story about grandpa, I hear you saying, here's these two things, but they're one, and that's what we are, Ms.

01:05:50.709 --> 01:05:51.931
Cecil, right?

01:05:52.552 --> 01:05:59.382
And then in this story of the Vidhin, I hear, here is the Vidhin who is

01:05:59.682 --> 01:06:09.431
Indigenous being kind of like the only power against that other thing, the European values or whatever.

01:06:09.472 --> 01:06:21.703
So I think what you're seeing is it's not like my father interpreted Our Lady of Guadalupe as a political entity.

01:06:21.723 --> 01:06:29.571
I, through my own evolution,

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.742
have come to see her that way.

01:06:32.443 --> 01:06:32.784
Yeah.

01:06:33.465 --> 01:06:42.837
So it's not like, all I'm saying is that being mestizo was not an unfamiliar term.

01:06:43.178 --> 01:06:43.458
Yeah.

01:06:44.599 --> 01:06:57.056
Seeing her in the context of the virgen, I see her in a political, you know, in a political frame.

01:06:58.077 --> 01:06:58.478
Okay.

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:19.514
Not that... I think my dad was probably how you would define... He was apolitical in this particular... He was just being matter of fact.

01:07:19.554 --> 01:07:23.519
You know, we've got these... No, he was being political.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:27.985
He was telling us to be proud of being brown.

01:07:28.746 --> 01:07:31.570
He was saying, we have a history.

01:07:32.225 --> 01:07:45.859
So now I have this experience of a production called Virgen de Tepeyac.

01:07:46.439 --> 01:08:01.675
I see it in political terms, but I also see, and I see it probably in the same way, you know, which is the pride of

01:08:02.718 --> 01:08:12.537
of this icon being brown and speaking Nahuatl.

01:08:12.557 --> 01:08:17.947
So I don't see them as too incongruent.

01:08:17.967 --> 01:08:19.410
I think my

01:08:21.095 --> 01:08:35.233
My confusion, though, is like in the story and grandpa's story, there is this real kind of like clear sense of identity.

01:08:35.373 --> 01:08:35.854
Right.

01:08:35.874 --> 01:08:36.795
We are.

01:08:37.616 --> 01:08:38.917
Yes.

01:08:38.937 --> 01:08:40.720
European and indigenous.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.561
Yes.

01:08:41.581 --> 01:08:50.612
And I'm not seeing that in terms of the virgen, because you're basically saying the virgen is indigenous.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:56.188
and addressing European concerns or European things.

01:08:56.469 --> 01:08:57.170
Right.

01:08:57.330 --> 01:08:58.833
European power structures.

01:08:59.214 --> 01:09:00.496
Right.

01:09:01.397 --> 01:09:07.548
So that's what I'm seeing as like, is she mestizo or is she indigenous?

01:09:08.049 --> 01:09:09.171
She's indigenous.

01:09:09.432 --> 01:09:10.594
Okay.

01:09:10.614 --> 01:09:12.798
She's indigenous.

01:09:13.719 --> 01:09:13.880
Okay.

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:17.005
Well, let's take...

01:09:20.866 --> 01:09:24.150
She's the... Hold on, I'm going to grab another water.

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:25.932
You want it?

01:09:25.952 --> 01:09:26.053
Yeah.

01:09:26.073 --> 01:09:33.081
She's the... What's the word I want?

01:09:33.101 --> 01:09:34.463
Manifestation?

01:09:34.743 --> 01:09:39.630
The manifestation... Of... The Blessed Mary.

01:09:41.212 --> 01:09:41.572
Right?

01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:44.276
The Mother of God.

01:09:44.456 --> 01:09:45.978
Yes, the Mother of Jesus.

01:09:46.358 --> 01:09:47.059
Yeah, not God.

01:09:47.343 --> 01:09:47.944
Oh, sorry.

01:09:47.964 --> 01:09:48.124
Jesus.

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:48.846
Jesus.

01:09:49.066 --> 01:09:49.888
I'm not a Catholic.

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:52.172
I don't know.

01:09:52.192 --> 01:09:56.320
Good.

01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:07.039
So in that sense, but, but, she's, she's Indian.

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.963
She's Indian.

01:10:10.327 --> 01:10:17.237
Well, so here's my kind of theory on that because I think I showed you like my chapters for my dissertation.

01:10:18.719 --> 01:10:21.103
And I'm going to put one in there on the Vidhin, right?

01:10:21.944 --> 01:10:30.356
Because I think it is a really kind of like important part of this mestizo, mestizaje story, right?

01:10:30.637 --> 01:10:34.883
And that's that you have this

01:10:35.082 --> 01:10:37.505
Whatever she is, right?

01:10:37.565 --> 01:10:44.134
Whether she's an apparition, whether she's a goddess, like whatever she is, she's indigenous, right?

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:56.730
And she's been indigenous until the Catholic Church comes along and says, oh, we can use this to help convert those indigenous, right?

01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:00.094
And it's at that point that she becomes mestizo.

01:11:01.171 --> 01:11:28.723
not when she first appears to Juan Diego, not when she does all the things that she's, you know, build my temple here, that, you know, that this, this image, this, whatever happened that when, when Juan Diego went up to Tepeyac, that, that event was used to manipulate and convert.

01:11:30.565 --> 01:11:30.925
And that,

01:11:31.327 --> 01:11:41.523
Later, it wasn't that moment that she came, but that later on she was made mestizo for these other political purposes.

01:11:43.746 --> 01:11:50.196
That's my kind of take on it.

01:11:50.216 --> 01:11:52.660
I think the Catholic Church would want

01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:01.774
would want to claim in some way or another that she's Miss Diesel.

01:12:02.295 --> 01:12:02.615
Yeah.

01:12:03.295 --> 01:12:04.196
She's not.

01:12:04.216 --> 01:12:05.117
She's Indian.

01:12:05.698 --> 01:12:06.058
Right.

01:12:06.138 --> 01:12:08.520
She's Indian through and through.

01:12:08.561 --> 01:12:13.625
How is it possible that the mother of God or the mother of Jesus can be Indian?

01:12:14.987 --> 01:12:16.548
She can be anything she wants.

01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:19.211
But you're right.

01:12:19.311 --> 01:12:22.434
She gets used to, what do you call it?

01:12:22.894 --> 01:12:23.575
To convert.

01:12:24.456 --> 01:12:24.756
Yeah.

01:12:25.411 --> 01:12:28.638
Okay, so this is really interesting.

01:12:29.239 --> 01:12:33.507
If we can go back to that topic of mestizaje, mestizo.

01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:43.588
So you said that early in your life, which I think is like really, really interesting because

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:53.313
Prior to this question or this particular topic, you know, we're talking about how your family is very kind of like... Conservative.

01:12:53.333 --> 01:12:54.895
Conservative, right?

01:12:55.516 --> 01:13:03.868
And then here comes Grandpa telling his little brown babies to be proud because you're Mestizo, you have a history.

01:13:04.268 --> 01:13:10.096
Like, I think that's... I don't even know how to explain that, but okay.

01:13:10.617 --> 01:13:14.622
So, but as a child, you are...

01:13:15.243 --> 01:13:19.347
familiar with this term because of your parents, right?

01:13:19.407 --> 01:13:19.907
Your dad.

01:13:21.448 --> 01:13:32.058
And so you've always been somewhat aware that what was meant by that was indigenous and European.

01:13:33.619 --> 01:13:36.582
And then there was some kind of pride in that.

01:13:37.162 --> 01:13:39.645
There was pride in being Indian.

01:13:40.105 --> 01:13:41.106
Oh, sorry.

01:13:41.126 --> 01:13:41.226
Okay.

01:13:41.246 --> 01:13:42.847
Pride in being Indian.

01:13:42.867 --> 01:13:43.148
Not Ms.

01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:43.528
Diesel.

01:13:44.167 --> 01:13:47.792
Pride in, well, because we're mestizal, okay?

01:13:51.157 --> 01:13:52.880
Pride in being brown.

01:13:53.981 --> 01:13:58.568
So not just being proud of the European side, but this other part too.

01:13:58.588 --> 01:13:59.450
Right, right.

01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:00.070
I see.

01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:04.617
And not even winning, not even paying attention to the European side of things.

01:14:05.999 --> 01:14:10.105
Who cares what that white stuff is?

01:14:10.125 --> 01:14:13.090
We're more interested in being Indian.

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.971
That's the way.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:36.853
it came across to us and then so so that's interesting and then what was so you mentioned that when you went to san jose state you came into contact with that biculturalism bilingualism right um

01:14:37.964 --> 01:14:51.882
And was this idea or notion of mestizaje or mestizo, was that also kind of floating around during that time period that you remember?

01:14:52.784 --> 01:14:53.665
I don't remember.

01:14:54.606 --> 01:14:55.627
You don't remember.

01:14:58.131 --> 01:14:58.471
Okay.

01:15:00.293 --> 01:15:01.315
I don't remember.

01:15:01.535 --> 01:15:02.156
Wait a minute.

01:15:03.658 --> 01:15:04.579
I don't think.

01:15:06.871 --> 01:15:12.838
I want to say that that concept... I don't think I'm picking you up here.

01:15:12.858 --> 01:15:13.459
Talk again.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:27.635
I don't think that concept is bantered around until we get to the Chicano moratorium.

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:28.456
Okay.

01:15:29.017 --> 01:15:32.681
So within the context of San Jose State, I don't remember.

01:15:33.342 --> 01:15:36.085
Certainly not as part of

01:15:37.145 --> 01:15:38.567
Vietnam.

01:15:39.389 --> 01:15:45.198
But by the time we get to Chicano moratorium... What are you doing?

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:55.454
We're doing an interview so you could tell me to stop so you can make your sandwich.

01:15:56.836 --> 01:16:03.827
So we're talking about mestizaje.

01:16:04.313 --> 01:16:32.076
Mestizo and when you like heard it again as an adult and you were saying that you didn't hear anything about it when you were at state but like some point after like the Chicano moratorium so like in the early kind of mid 70s like

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:57.772
And so can you tell me a little bit, if you remember, like what you remember about it in that time period, where you're hearing it from, what you are hearing about it?

01:16:57.792 --> 01:17:01.877
I'm trying to think of, are there,

01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:17.186
Are there, you know, there's a lot of different theatrical companies that have sprung up all throughout the Southwest.

01:17:18.729 --> 01:17:33.872
A lot of those directors, you know, very thoughtful, mindful kinds of individuals, creative,

01:17:35.202 --> 01:17:51.721
And so you hear, trying to think of, you know, some of them are college professors, some of them are students, some of them are... Can you think of any of their names?

01:17:58.089 --> 01:17:59.370
I wouldn't be...

01:18:05.223 --> 01:18:08.307
You'd have to give me a while to think of their names.

01:18:12.873 --> 01:18:19.823
But okay, so you're talking about these other kind of theatrical groups that are springing up.

01:18:20.323 --> 01:18:32.800
Yeah, and you're starting to see writers, you're starting to see college professors, you're starting to see

01:18:33.893 --> 01:18:36.616
student leaders, and articulate.

01:18:38.437 --> 01:18:40.780
And you start hearing those kinds of terms.

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:47.426
And again, here, it has to do with identifying.

01:18:49.688 --> 01:19:02.601
Up until now, remember I told you that in the US, up until the 50s and early 60s, we really don't have an identity.

01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:08.097
Or if we have an identity, it's an identity that's been created by someone other than us.

01:19:10.039 --> 01:19:33.043
And now you hear Chicano poets, Chicano writers, Chicano filmmakers, Chicano directors, Chicano student leaders, students who are beginning to voice themselves.

01:19:35.656 --> 01:19:40.724
And that's where you see, you know, you hear the term.

01:19:49.318 --> 01:19:57.611
I don't know how, I don't know how, certainly it runs the gamut.

01:19:59.234 --> 01:20:02.659
You know, I think of, you know, I think of someone like Breeze who

01:20:05.677 --> 01:20:32.927
Studied, like I said, you know, reading the , it's a studying with Mexican philosophy teachers who has, who is grasping, if you will, and interpreting for a Chicano movement, what it is to be indigenous.

01:20:34.409 --> 01:20:35.650
You know what that,

01:20:36.136 --> 01:20:42.825
Some of the terms that, that he pulled out of Pupupu were really, I thought were.

01:20:48.493 --> 01:20:51.537
Were really spectacular.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.322
Can you remember any?

01:20:58.606 --> 01:21:02.211
There was a term for artist.

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:13.022
It was the Mexican, I think is the indigenous word.

01:21:13.062 --> 01:21:18.350
The Spanish translation is .

01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:32.451
And the English interpretation is, or that was the word that they used for artisan.

01:21:34.591 --> 01:21:36.653
So what did that mean?

01:21:36.673 --> 01:22:00.138
That meant that the person that was creating was creating through a life, through a state of creation, which is the state of a God, that God is who, who creates things.

01:22:00.158 --> 01:22:01.780
And so for an artist,

01:22:05.152 --> 01:22:19.948
To be, to have that kind of creativity meant that he had an affinity with some God or deity.

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:21.270
It's not even that.

01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:22.792
I don't think that's what it means.

01:22:22.872 --> 01:22:29.239
It means... Not like a God is speaking through you or something like that.

01:22:29.259 --> 01:22:32.222
No, it's that, is that you...

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:44.625
Corazon endiosado, your heart has been enveloped by... Like possessed.

01:22:45.326 --> 01:22:50.093
By a spirit, by the spirit of creativity.

01:22:50.113 --> 01:22:52.095
But like possession or something like that?

01:22:52.115 --> 01:22:53.257
Not possessed.

01:22:53.598 --> 01:22:56.161
Not like we use possessed today.

01:22:58.104 --> 01:22:58.665
But...

01:22:59.101 --> 01:23:07.268
Like it's whatever the spirit is, has taken over that person and enables them to be created.

01:23:08.069 --> 01:23:09.971
That's what I said earlier in your head now.

01:23:14.195 --> 01:23:21.742
Um, so, but watch what it means.

01:23:22.943 --> 01:23:23.343
Yes.

01:23:23.984 --> 01:23:28.568
It's the fusing of the spirit and the body.

01:23:28.919 --> 01:23:29.780
with the body.

01:23:31.222 --> 01:23:35.027
There was another term, you've seen it, ing lakesh.

01:23:36.609 --> 01:23:40.914
You are my other self.

01:23:40.934 --> 01:23:42.296
That duality.

01:23:42.316 --> 01:23:51.728
And that duality has to do with the whole concept of the Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent.

01:23:52.929 --> 01:23:53.951
Two opposites.

01:23:55.132 --> 01:23:56.614
Where is that opposite?

01:23:57.218 --> 01:24:25.234
plumes are on birds yeah serpents i'm asking you i'm not like being facetious serpents crawl on the earth so that what you have now are two different entities fused together but it really is more about the symbol the sim symbolic

01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:39.516
nature of how the Maya saw the world, that philosophy that, that there's always two, everything is in, you want everything in balance.

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:48.867
It's like you have a right and a left and up and a down, a forward and a back.

01:24:50.649 --> 01:24:54.394
And that your life is supposed to be in balance.

01:24:54.796 --> 01:24:57.800
Even, you know what I do, Robbie?

01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:03.227
I literally, if I'm going to exercise on this side, I got to exercise on this side.

01:25:03.968 --> 01:25:06.391
If I put lotion on this side, I got to put lotion on.

01:25:06.671 --> 01:25:16.704
I've deemed my right side of my body as earth, and I deem my left side as spirit.

01:25:17.805 --> 01:25:23.993
So whenever anything is bothering me on my left side, I'm like, what's wrong with my spiritual side of the world?

01:25:24.445 --> 01:25:52.596
yeah okay you're talking about your left and right side one being spirit earth we're talking about about indigenous beliefs yeah no i'm just trying to get us back to what we were just talking about because keep getting interrupted

01:26:05.485 --> 01:26:07.187
That's all I had to say about it.

01:26:11.851 --> 01:26:13.592
So what does that have to do?

01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:19.178
Okay, testing.

01:26:19.198 --> 01:26:19.638
Go ahead.

01:26:20.259 --> 01:26:20.819
Say something.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.200
Can you hear me?

01:26:22.441 --> 01:26:22.681
Nope.

01:26:22.701 --> 01:26:23.281
Can you hear me?

01:26:23.482 --> 01:26:23.742
Nope.

01:26:24.182 --> 01:26:24.703
Not yet?

01:26:25.183 --> 01:26:25.343
Nope.

01:26:25.363 --> 01:26:26.044
How about over here?

01:26:26.104 --> 01:26:27.205
Put it over here.

01:26:27.225 --> 01:26:28.426
Then you can't hear me.

01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:31.669
Let's see.

01:26:31.889 --> 01:26:33.090
Can you hear me now?

01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.931
Yes.

01:26:33.951 --> 01:26:34.952
Can we hear each other?

01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.931
Yes.

01:26:38.315 --> 01:26:41.680
Okay, so we're talking about mesizaje.

01:26:42.181 --> 01:26:56.263
We are talking about your familiarity with the concept from when you first learned about it as a child from grandpa.

01:26:57.745 --> 01:27:02.813
And then when you started to hear it again as an adult.

01:27:03.721 --> 01:27:13.997
And you're talking about that it comes back up again around the Chicano moratorium time period.

01:27:15.199 --> 01:27:21.709
That you're seeing different teatros kind of spring up over the Southwest.

01:27:21.729 --> 01:27:29.121
And that people who are in positions of leadership are maybe more... Influenced.

01:27:30.113 --> 01:27:34.778
or that they're more like educated or something like that.

01:27:34.798 --> 01:27:38.863
And that this term is popping up again.

01:27:39.103 --> 01:27:39.363
Right.

01:27:41.305 --> 01:27:47.993
And then, um, you're talking about, uh, you know what?

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:52.898
I don't, because you had, you got, went on this tangent about,

01:27:54.076 --> 01:28:23.526
uh different things that were learned from like ancient indigenous or like indigenous kinds of philosophies and you were talking about the dualism and stuff like that right um so i think like if you could maybe kind of bring that back to the messy topic like why did you when we when we started talking about this why did you then kind of go into the

01:28:24.282 --> 01:28:26.225
indigenous philosophy part of it.

01:28:26.245 --> 01:28:31.772
You know what, because I'm going to go back to the term mestizo, mestizake.

01:28:38.081 --> 01:28:52.821
It always, it was an acknowledgement that, that we were not pure Indian, that we had been

01:28:54.050 --> 01:29:14.280
a conquered people, you know, the Europeans had come, but the European blood was not as, as, as strong as the Indian blood, the Indian.

01:29:15.241 --> 01:29:20.749
And so Mestizahya always, even though it was acknowledging

01:29:21.995 --> 01:29:27.300
it was acknowledging both European and indigenous blood.

01:29:28.562 --> 01:29:46.760
It was really a call to pride in being Indian and having that Indian blood, even if we didn't know that much about it, that we had that pride in being Indian.

01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:49.943
And I don't know whether or not, you know, I don't even know,

01:29:51.492 --> 01:29:55.756
That my grandparents... Which grandparents?

01:29:55.776 --> 01:29:56.777
Both grandparents.

01:29:56.797 --> 01:30:06.607
So my mom's mother, she looked more European as opposed to my grandfather.

01:30:06.627 --> 01:30:13.814
My grandfather would have told you how proud he was to have been Wichol Indian.

01:30:15.756 --> 01:30:19.660
My grandmother wouldn't want to talk about it.

01:30:20.112 --> 01:30:23.578
She looked more European.

01:30:23.598 --> 01:30:34.756
So I think a lot of it had to do with, because clearly, clearly you see, you see the racism, you see the color.

01:30:36.679 --> 01:30:41.006
Even in Mexico, you see the color, you see, what do you call it?

01:30:41.547 --> 01:30:43.269
Fair-skinned people.

01:30:44.391 --> 01:30:46.555
And somewhere or another, they're elevated.

01:30:47.296 --> 01:30:47.436
Mm-hmm.

01:30:48.428 --> 01:30:55.434
As opposed to darker skin, dark haired Indian people.

01:30:55.454 --> 01:31:06.003
So my, and then on my dad's side, again, my grandmother was more indigenous looking than my grandfather.

01:31:06.063 --> 01:31:08.926
My grandfather was more European yet looking.

01:31:09.727 --> 01:31:17.153
My father, my own father and mother are both dark, dark hair, dark skin.

01:31:18.736 --> 01:31:25.307
And so maybe it was their way of claiming I'm just as good.

01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:27.491
I don't know.

01:31:28.412 --> 01:31:44.499
But clearly, to me, the way it came across, and maybe it was because I'm dark skinned, was to feel pride in having indigenous blood.

01:31:44.519 --> 01:31:44.659
Mm-hmm.

01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:58.588
And when you said that you made a reference about Indian blood being stronger, what do you mean when you say Indian blood?

01:31:58.628 --> 01:32:11.407
Tribal blood, Indian blood, Azteca, Maya.

01:32:12.509 --> 01:32:15.473
But what do you mean when you say blood?

01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:21.366
Like, do you mean, like, the genetics?

01:32:21.966 --> 01:32:28.153
Or do you mean the culture, the values, the knowledge?

01:32:28.914 --> 01:32:32.257
Or are you strictly meaning, like, the genetics?

01:32:33.719 --> 01:32:34.840
The biological?

01:32:40.906 --> 01:32:42.388
The...

01:32:47.667 --> 01:32:49.449
Probably both, Roby.

01:32:49.929 --> 01:32:51.051
So like all of that?

01:32:52.993 --> 01:32:55.175
Mm-hmm.

01:32:55.195 --> 01:32:55.295
Okay.

01:32:55.315 --> 01:32:55.455
Mm-hmm.

01:32:55.475 --> 01:33:03.123
And then, so part of what you were talking about too was this idea of like Chicano identity, right?

01:33:03.163 --> 01:33:12.713
You mentioned like, oh, after the Chicano moratorium, you start seeing Chicano theater, Chicano this, Chicano that, Chicano blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:17.013
Um, how did you understand what that meant?

01:33:17.173 --> 01:33:19.557
What did, what does Chicano mean?

01:33:20.759 --> 01:33:22.862
Um, I thought that.

01:33:24.184 --> 01:33:26.127
Like, what was that identity?

01:33:26.147 --> 01:33:27.049
It was, what do you call it?

01:33:29.853 --> 01:33:31.917
I don't remember exactly.

01:33:31.937 --> 01:33:40.290
I remember Louise defining Chicano, that it came from an indigenous word.

01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.911
Hmm.

01:33:41.752 --> 01:34:10.003
so it was a what do you call it it was kind of a hyphenated kind of from some kind of some kind of indigenous word and i don't know what it where it came from i just remember the concept that it was that that it was a claim to it was a claim to our indian heritage and it was a claim it and it was and it was an ancient word

01:34:10.338 --> 01:34:12.000
But I couldn't tell you more than that.

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:38.067
Do you have any idea where that came from?

01:34:38.418 --> 01:34:46.868
Aside from like you heard somebody like Luis talk about it and that's how you became familiar with it.

01:34:46.888 --> 01:34:51.173
I'm talking about that Mestizo, Mestizaje stuff, not necessarily the Chicano stuff.

01:34:56.759 --> 01:35:03.046
Do you know where they picked that up from or where you think they picked it up from or was it just like, oh, one day they showed up?

01:35:03.066 --> 01:35:06.010
I thought it was just common knowledge.

01:35:06.931 --> 01:35:07.952
Common knowledge?

01:35:08.287 --> 01:35:09.549
among Mexicans.

01:35:09.569 --> 01:35:13.855
I mean, that was our, that was our heritage.

01:35:15.418 --> 01:35:23.690
We had been a hundred percent indigenous and then we're invaded and we're, what do you call it?

01:35:23.710 --> 01:35:31.843
So you're kind of tying it to the history or like at least knowledge of, okay, this used to be an indigenous land.

01:35:32.984 --> 01:35:33.265
Right.

01:35:33.525 --> 01:35:36.049
Spanish people, white people came in.

01:35:36.552 --> 01:35:41.256
and conquered it, and so there must be... Rape us.

01:35:41.276 --> 01:35:41.676
Rape us.

01:35:41.697 --> 01:35:48.142
The logical conclusion would be that there is now this kind of new mix of people.

01:35:48.222 --> 01:35:51.145
Yeah, I'm trying to think of the word mestiza.

01:35:51.725 --> 01:35:53.367
Mestiza.

01:35:56.009 --> 01:35:56.149
Mm-hmm.

01:35:56.169 --> 01:36:00.933
And where the word comes from.

01:36:00.953 --> 01:36:03.776
Mezcla is a mix.

01:36:04.436 --> 01:36:05.057
Mix.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:15.029
Is Mestiza a Spanish word that gets created in the new world?

01:36:20.916 --> 01:36:28.365
So that, you know, it just comes through generation after generation.

01:36:28.385 --> 01:36:29.266
Mestiza.

01:36:29.486 --> 01:36:35.533
Mestizos.

01:36:35.665 --> 01:36:40.470
Like Creoles, Cajuns.

01:36:47.637 --> 01:36:48.017
Okay.

01:36:48.518 --> 01:36:53.843
Trying to think if there's anything else about the Misty Saha stuff.

01:36:53.863 --> 01:37:03.192
So you're not super familiar with where, aside from just assuming or thinking that

01:37:03.256 --> 01:37:07.942
It's a concept or it's an idea that everybody knows about.

01:37:10.625 --> 01:37:26.986
Do you think, like, if it's something that everybody knows about, why is it kind of being picked up or, like, does it seem to come back into play during the Chicano movement or Chicano more?

01:37:27.026 --> 01:37:33.094
Well, I mean, clearly, Robie, American culture,

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:54.685
American culture isn't, and certainly I remember terms like assimilation, acculturation, those kinds of terms, you know, again, here, those are terms that you're hearing in academia.

01:37:55.185 --> 01:38:00.972
You're hearing those terms that have been created by white scholars.

01:38:02.892 --> 01:38:17.785
There's no recognition in any of that kind of research or that kind of work that's been done to address Mexican-Americans.

01:38:19.807 --> 01:38:22.350
Maybe African-American, I'm not familiar.

01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:24.692
Certainly, what do you call it?

01:38:27.314 --> 01:38:32.899
By the 50s, by the 50s and early, by the 50s,

01:38:33.706 --> 01:38:43.459
Um, uh, American Indians, Native Americans are thought to have been eradicated.

01:38:43.479 --> 01:38:45.482
We don't have an Indian problem anymore.

01:38:47.185 --> 01:38:48.546
We got them off the reservation.

01:38:48.587 --> 01:38:50.529
We're getting them out of here.

01:38:50.549 --> 01:39:00.523
They're not, and there's no articulation, you know, for Mexicans, even though we've been here for, I don't know how many hundreds of years.

01:39:01.651 --> 01:39:31.185
Certainly in California and the Southwest, we've been here, but in mainstream or in my world, in my little Kern County world, I'm not seeing, I'm not seeing in photo play or 17 or any of those little magazines, anything about Latinas, anything about brown skin,

01:39:32.296 --> 01:39:37.724
that what you see in magazines today is not what I was seeing when I was a kid.

01:39:37.744 --> 01:39:41.048
It was all white, all blonde, all blue eyed.

01:39:43.452 --> 01:39:55.789
So there was never any, so, so it's not surprising that you didn't hear, you know, terms about, about being indigenous and having pride in

01:39:56.225 --> 01:39:56.926
Are you kidding?

01:39:56.966 --> 01:39:59.330
They've just wiped out all the Indians.

01:39:59.450 --> 01:40:01.914
They think they've gotten rid of the Indian problem.

01:40:01.934 --> 01:40:05.419
We can just dust that under the rug.

01:40:05.439 --> 01:40:11.269
You know, the original sin of this country.

01:40:11.289 --> 01:40:11.589
What?

01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:14.754
We're going to talk about Mexicans and their Indian heritage?

01:40:14.854 --> 01:40:15.535
Oh, no, no, no.

01:40:16.757 --> 01:40:18.079
We're not having any of that.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.343
So you don't ever see that.

01:40:20.503 --> 01:40:23.127
So you see...

01:40:24.001 --> 01:40:45.484
Chicanos taking on as a badge of pride, you know, being, being mestizo, being, because up until then, you're trying to push me, you know, this whole conversation about the census.

01:40:45.504 --> 01:40:49.369
I mean, we were identified as white.

01:40:51.031 --> 01:40:53.333
There was no box for Mexican.

01:40:53.633 --> 01:40:55.955
There was no Hispanic box.

01:40:57.777 --> 01:41:03.123
There was no, you know, I'm either black or white.

01:41:03.143 --> 01:41:04.024
I wasn't black.

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:22.223
So, so to, to identify, to, to, to grab hold of, of this piece of your, of your heritage,

01:41:23.401 --> 01:41:29.149
is where that comes from, that identity.

01:41:29.169 --> 01:41:34.276
But are you referring to the Chicano identity or the Mestizo identity?

01:41:34.316 --> 01:41:40.465
Chicano and Mestizo are synonymous.

01:41:40.485 --> 01:41:41.126
To whom?

01:41:41.246 --> 01:41:46.513
To those people who were assuming the Chicano identity?

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:53.323
So you would say that most everybody who is using that Chicano term

01:41:54.181 --> 01:41:59.890
was identified as mestizo or identified, saw themselves as mestizo.

01:42:02.273 --> 01:42:06.039
Mestizos.

01:42:07.722 --> 01:42:10.246
And then where did Latino come from?

01:42:10.386 --> 01:42:10.767
I don't know.

01:42:11.768 --> 01:42:12.629
I missed something.

01:42:13.511 --> 01:42:14.973
I was too busy having kids.

01:42:15.694 --> 01:42:16.876
I didn't see it coming.

01:42:16.956 --> 01:42:18.218
I don't know where it came.

01:42:18.378 --> 01:42:19.320
And Hispanic?

01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:20.802
All of a sudden we're Hispanic.

01:42:20.882 --> 01:42:21.403
What?

01:42:22.447 --> 01:42:24.829
Actually, I was reading an article.

01:42:24.869 --> 01:42:44.189
Some guy was saying that when the Chicano movement was happening and people were starting to identify as Chicano, that other Latin American communities were like, we're not Chicano, we're Latinos.

01:42:45.351 --> 01:42:51.677
And then it was kind of that there was a real kind of like

01:42:52.214 --> 01:42:54.476
measure to distance themselves.

01:42:55.177 --> 01:43:07.188
And then who knows, I mean, maybe there was some like Mexican Americans that also were, you know, like Lulax and the American GI forum type groups, you know, that were like, no, we're not Chicanos.

01:43:08.029 --> 01:43:08.269
Yeah.

01:43:08.289 --> 01:43:19.420
Chicano probably, probably if, if I walked in a room and I said, I'm Chicana, there is a certain political undertone to that.

01:43:20.817 --> 01:43:22.699
So the Mexican-American.

01:43:24.121 --> 01:43:25.523
Oh, no, I'm Mexican-American.

01:43:25.823 --> 01:43:27.465
That's more your assimilated.

01:43:28.086 --> 01:43:31.751
Me, I was being a little radical and calling myself Chicana.

01:43:31.771 --> 01:43:32.071
Yeah.

01:43:32.852 --> 01:43:36.156
And then someplace along the line, somebody took that away from me.

01:43:37.117 --> 01:43:38.119
Called you Latino?

01:43:38.659 --> 01:43:40.141
No, called me Hispanic.

01:43:40.181 --> 01:43:41.903
That came first.

01:43:43.085 --> 01:43:44.046
I always used it.

01:43:44.887 --> 01:43:47.851
I always, it graded on me.

01:43:47.911 --> 01:43:49.693
I didn't like the term Hispanic.

01:43:50.028 --> 01:43:52.732
It's too European for me.

01:43:52.752 --> 01:43:56.057
So I didn't mind adopting Latina.

01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:00.743
That was better than Hispanic.

01:44:01.244 --> 01:44:06.171
Hispanic was like, you're trying to be European again.

01:44:07.433 --> 01:44:08.234
I didn't like that.

01:44:09.736 --> 01:44:13.622
Let's see, what was I going to ask?

01:44:18.698 --> 01:44:28.090
Okay, um, I think that's all I, I think that's all I really have.

01:44:28.551 --> 01:44:36.361
Unless you want to, like, add anything else, like your own kind of concluding remarks.

01:44:37.242 --> 01:44:44.571
Because really for me, like, what I'm interested in is trying to understand, like,

01:44:46.171 --> 01:45:10.551
where this term of mestizo, mestizaje, like how it was understood by people who were involved in the Chicano movement, where they came up with it, how they understood it, how they were familiar with it, how they, what I already said, how they understood it, right?

01:45:10.992 --> 01:45:11.132
Mm-hmm.

01:45:11.602 --> 01:45:16.808
Like how did they see, if it was even something that was a big deal, right?

01:45:19.111 --> 01:45:21.534
And like where that kind of came from.

01:45:21.554 --> 01:45:23.196
Like what are the connections?

01:45:23.276 --> 01:45:32.046
Because whatever term you want to use, like that's not a United States thing.

01:45:33.248 --> 01:45:38.014
Like it is, it has a long history in Latin America.

01:45:40.456 --> 01:45:40.917
But

01:45:41.690 --> 01:45:51.104
From what I know about it is that it doesn't become a kind of like topic in the U.S.

01:45:51.124 --> 01:46:00.017
or like, you know, in documented history until around the Chicana movement.

01:46:01.179 --> 01:46:04.644
And so I'm curious, like, how did that happen?

01:46:05.285 --> 01:46:06.506
How did it get up here?

01:46:06.566 --> 01:46:07.948
How did it get adopted?

01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:09.030
How was it?

01:46:09.668 --> 01:46:12.711
Was it an intellectual thing?

01:46:12.771 --> 01:46:14.132
Was it a cultural thing?

01:46:14.893 --> 01:46:34.732
Part of what I found really interesting about our talk is that you're talking about hearing it first from your dad, from grandpa, who's uneducated, who's poor, but this is some kind of idea that he is aware of.

01:46:35.153 --> 01:46:37.055
Where he got that from, I don't know.

01:46:38.416 --> 01:46:39.557
Right?

01:46:40.128 --> 01:46:43.571
Like, where is this coming down from?

01:46:45.273 --> 01:46:46.915
So I find that interesting.

01:46:48.716 --> 01:47:02.230
The other thing, like, when I was talking to dad about this, particularly, like, as... Because dad, like, when I asked dad about it, he said, we never thought of ourselves as mestizo.

01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:08.516
We thought of ourselves, we identified as Tejanos and Mexicans.

01:47:08.536 --> 01:47:09.797
Tejanos and Mexicans.

01:47:10.216 --> 01:47:36.662
and that it wasn't until like maybe later when he was like part of you know the movement when he was when he went into college and then became more involved in the movement that this term kind of sprung out right or that he became familiar with it and that he recalls it being um

01:47:37.047 --> 01:48:01.705
like something that was talked about or or like this concept that was talked about from um corky gonzalez do you know corky gonzalez and his poem yo soy walking right and um so anyway so i think it's it's interesting to hear those kind of different different backgrounds on it

01:48:03.170 --> 01:48:07.155
So I think that's really it for me.

01:48:07.215 --> 01:48:09.138
I don't know if there's anything you want to add.

01:48:11.261 --> 01:48:12.542
Do you want to add anything else?

01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:31.708
The only thing that I would add, Robi, is that especially in your line of work, I think that

01:48:32.667 --> 01:48:42.759
what was lost in colonization.

01:48:44.201 --> 01:48:56.155
And probably this goes to not just Mexico and it goes to all the indigenous people of this continent.

01:48:58.819 --> 01:49:01.662
But there was, there was

01:49:02.097 --> 01:49:02.958
a people.

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:10.289
There was a way in which they saw and interpreted the world.

01:49:12.131 --> 01:49:15.436
There's a way in which they raised their children.

01:49:15.496 --> 01:49:23.067
There was a way in which they defined roles and responsibilities.

01:49:23.087 --> 01:49:24.449
That was all disrupted.

01:49:28.154 --> 01:49:30.197
I think there are elements

01:49:31.139 --> 01:49:37.467
There are elements that have remained.

01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:43.095
I believe that there is such a thing as genetic memory.

01:49:46.519 --> 01:49:49.303
I'm only laughing because my dad said the same thing.

01:49:49.724 --> 01:49:49.944
Yeah.

01:49:50.064 --> 01:49:55.571
And I think that there's, what do you call it?

01:49:55.872 --> 01:49:58.395
So I think that there's a way in which we

01:50:00.316 --> 01:50:14.116
inherent, we just look at the world in a certain kind of way and interpret the universe in a certain kind of way.

01:50:16.499 --> 01:50:26.914
I would hope that your generation will come closer to helping us regain

01:50:28.396 --> 01:50:29.597
some of that memory.

01:50:31.919 --> 01:50:44.731
Actually, this reminds me of something else my dad was talking about, or that came up in our conversation, which was the Reconquista, right?

01:50:45.432 --> 01:50:55.821
But the way that my dad and I were talking about it was because he actually, he didn't bring up, you know what the term is, Reconquista, no?

01:50:56.662 --> 01:51:07.993
The Reconquista, okay, so originally it was, it's used to describe the Spanish reclamation of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors, right?

01:51:09.515 --> 01:51:13.158
And they call that the Reconquista and then in the U.S.

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:22.247
the idea of the Reconquista is that Mexican Americans or Latinos

01:51:22.717 --> 01:51:30.371
are going to reclaim the, you know, like the Southwest, because that was part of our, our territory.

01:51:32.053 --> 01:51:47.661
Um, and so like, but what my dad and I were talking about was a reclamation of, um, we talked about land, culture, spirituality, ways of life and knowing.

01:51:48.991 --> 01:52:02.291
And so I was wondering if that's kind of like what you mean in terms of like this next generation or future generations that we get closer to reclaiming those things, right?

01:52:02.311 --> 01:52:09.302
Like this whole kind of like different lifestyle or making that kind of come back.

01:52:10.103 --> 01:52:11.005
Is that what you're talking about?

01:52:11.025 --> 01:52:17.715
Well, this is the little that I know, Ro, the little that I know is that

01:52:18.421 --> 01:52:30.179
The Inca were performing brain surgery before the Europeans even came to the Americas.

01:52:34.746 --> 01:52:44.260
The pyramids were built with musical tones.

01:52:50.264 --> 01:53:01.557
The astronomers that built the pyramids tracked the stars.

01:53:04.601 --> 01:53:18.077
That's telling you that there is an incredible wisdom in the Americas.

01:53:19.643 --> 01:53:31.721
And if they had that incredible wisdom, did they have a lifestyle that was fair and just?

01:53:31.741 --> 01:53:32.242
I don't know.

01:53:34.065 --> 01:53:35.046
That, I don't know.

01:53:35.126 --> 01:53:37.009
I just know the accomplishments.

01:53:41.476 --> 01:53:43.139
I know that, what do you call it?

01:53:43.339 --> 01:53:46.123
That we look at

01:53:47.538 --> 01:53:59.954
Europe and we look at their castles and we look at their Notre Dames and their cathedrals and we go and their paintings and we go, you know, we look at them in awe.

01:54:02.017 --> 01:54:05.882
What is it about the Americas that we don't look at it in awe?

01:54:08.866 --> 01:54:14.794
Are rocks too, I don't know.

01:54:15.034 --> 01:54:15.655
Too brown.

01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:26.276
Too brown, too rough, too... But yet what they accomplished was incredible.

01:54:26.296 --> 01:54:29.661
I don't know that... I'm not saying we're going to reclaim our land.

01:54:29.821 --> 01:54:35.069
I just want us to get to a world view.

01:54:38.114 --> 01:54:42.420
I think we have something to contribute to the world.

01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:43.482
That I want to see.

01:54:44.305 --> 01:54:46.567
I saw an inkling of it in my lifetime.

01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:53.114
I saw, I can't remember who it was.

01:54:55.937 --> 01:55:00.541
It was a politician, Latino politician in Santa Clara County.

01:55:02.824 --> 01:55:05.426
He won the election.

01:55:05.446 --> 01:55:06.608
He brought his father.

01:55:09.230 --> 01:55:13.975
It was the first time that you, you know, white people, it's all about them, right?

01:55:15.592 --> 01:55:37.233
This man was bringing his father on stage with him, telling the world that family is more important than anything, that you are not an individual, but that you're part of a construct.

01:55:37.253 --> 01:55:41.397
And I thought, you know, those are the kinds of things that people need to learn.

01:55:43.182 --> 01:55:54.013
And those are the kinds of things, those kinds of contributions are the kinds of contributions that I'm hoping that your work, your body of work will bring about.

01:55:56.395 --> 01:56:05.124
There must be something incredibly profound about who we are as a people.

01:56:07.286 --> 01:56:08.207
That's all I'm saying.

01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:13.172
And I'm not saying that's

01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:15.693
about land, about reclaiming.

01:56:17.876 --> 01:56:19.558
But I mean, that's not the only thing.

01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:26.127
You know, we're talking about culture, spirituality, ways of life.

01:56:26.187 --> 01:56:26.828
Knowing.

01:56:27.529 --> 01:56:28.190
Knowledge.

01:56:29.692 --> 01:56:33.217
So, I mean, and the land is connected to all of that too.

01:56:33.297 --> 01:56:37.203
So, I mean, it is an important component, but it's not the only component.

01:56:37.223 --> 01:56:37.843
Well, you know what?

01:56:37.863 --> 01:56:39.786
I see that for American Indians.

01:56:39.866 --> 01:56:41.168
Like, I see babes

01:56:41.536 --> 01:56:48.728
Once they don't have their land, they cease to be a people.

01:56:48.948 --> 01:56:50.911
They must hold on to land.

01:56:51.312 --> 01:56:54.837
That's kind of like what happened to our indigenous people.

01:56:54.857 --> 01:56:59.645
I mean, not that there aren't any indigenous people that exist, right?

01:56:59.725 --> 01:57:08.860
But that... I think part of the problem with the Mesisaje stuff is that

01:57:11.152 --> 01:57:21.744
It is, it's the establishment of like this new people that really are not, they're not, they're not new.

01:57:21.804 --> 01:57:22.445
They've been here.

01:57:22.485 --> 01:57:24.527
They're indigenous people.

01:57:24.547 --> 01:57:24.868
Right.

01:57:25.809 --> 01:57:38.323
But it is like, what's kind of pernicious about it is that the label, the idea behind it is to dispossess people of

01:57:38.573 --> 01:58:04.868
land to dispossess people of knowledge to dispossess people of their history and that you know that that has been like there's a point you were just talking about right in your childhood where you're not seeing in in the rest of the world appreciation for for your people right

01:58:05.506 --> 01:58:18.685
You're not seeing in the outer world recognition or appreciation even by your own people of your people, right?

01:58:20.007 --> 01:58:29.321
And that it's not until kind of like the Chicano movement that this starts to get a little bit flipped, right?

01:58:29.381 --> 01:58:31.885
That people are starting to really kind of like,

01:58:34.514 --> 01:58:44.287
I don't want to say wake up, but, like, become aware of their history, become aware of, on a more, like, on a mass movement, right?

01:58:44.327 --> 01:58:47.211
Not just you in your kitchen with your dad.

01:58:47.271 --> 01:58:48.412
Right, right.

01:58:48.432 --> 01:58:54.641
But that there's more people who are getting this message.

01:58:55.241 --> 01:59:00.288
I don't know where I was going with that, but whatever.

01:59:00.328 --> 01:59:01.329
So, anyways, okay.

01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:02.591
I think that's it.

01:59:02.711 --> 01:59:03.292
Anything else?

01:59:04.073 --> 01:59:04.133
No.

01:59:04.417 --> 01:59:05.989
No.

01:59:06.009 --> 01:59:06.634
All right.

01:59:06.654 --> 01:59:07.561
Thank you.

01:59:07.823 --> 01:59:08.790
Thank you very much.
