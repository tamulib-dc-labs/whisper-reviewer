WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:01.813
I'm going to go ahead and start this.

00:02.654 --> 00:06.459
So, can you tell me your name and age, please?

00:07.060 --> 00:08.702
Luis Valdez, I'm 79.

00:08.722 --> 00:10.985
79 years old.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.149
And then, can you tell me where you were born or where you grew up?

00:14.870 --> 00:16.632
If it's the same place or different places?

00:16.652 --> 00:19.816
No, I was born in Delano, California, 1940.

00:21.318 --> 00:28.907
I was in a family of migrant farm workers, so we went up and down the state from LA to San Jose, and...

00:30.322 --> 00:37.890
For a while, well, World War II interrupted and I was too young to travel, you know, besides my father had a farm that had belonged to a Japanese American farmer.

00:37.930 --> 00:39.992
So he was farming that during the war.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.235
But after the war, everything changed.

00:42.255 --> 00:45.618
We lost the farm and we had to get back on the road again.

00:45.658 --> 00:53.086
Some of my earliest memories of when I was six stemmed from that, that whole experience of being on the road.

00:53.166 --> 00:59.653
And when you're young, I mean, it feels like it's your whole lifetime, but

01:00.038 --> 01:06.084
Actually, we were on the road for seven years, from the time I was six until I was 13.

01:07.025 --> 01:12.149
We moved to San Jose when I was 13, settled in San Jose, East San Jose.

01:12.450 --> 01:14.512
We were still farm workers.

01:14.532 --> 01:24.441
So for the next five years, I was still a farm worker in and around San Jose, you know, picking everything, tomatoes, beans, prunes, apricots, everything, apples.

01:24.461 --> 01:27.003
And San Jose was very different then.

01:27.063 --> 01:29.826
It was all orchards or row crops.

01:30.683 --> 01:39.536
Even though, I mean, there were a lot of crops and a lot of small farms, there was still a lot of unemployment because there were a lot of farm workers around.

01:39.576 --> 01:47.668
And so you had to get to the farm labor office really early in the morning, 4 or 4.30, to be able to really locate a job.

01:47.728 --> 01:52.115
You know, if you were looking for a job, the competition was enormous.

01:52.175 --> 01:53.637
I remember it was hard times.

01:54.298 --> 01:59.526
It felt like the depression from the 1930s had extended all the way into the 50s.

01:59.742 --> 02:02.806
So, and that was true throughout high school.

02:03.147 --> 02:09.195
I graduated in 1958, and then I went to San Jose State for six years.

02:09.335 --> 02:11.398
Where did you go to high school, just out of curiosity?

02:11.418 --> 02:12.219
James Lick High School.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.020
Oh, you did?

02:13.061 --> 02:14.883
Yeah, it was the only high school on the east side.

02:16.225 --> 02:20.090
And it impressed me because it was integrated.

02:21.232 --> 02:29.243
And my brother, I had an older brother, my brother Frank, he passed away since then.

02:31.501 --> 02:36.888
So he started going there in 55, I think.

02:36.928 --> 02:37.469
56?

02:37.769 --> 02:38.370
Yeah, 55.

02:41.454 --> 02:41.994
No, we're 53.

02:42.075 --> 02:44.838
He was in high school already.

02:44.858 --> 02:45.839
He graduated in 55.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.361
So 53 to 55.

02:47.582 --> 02:51.126
I started in 54 at the James Lake.

02:51.607 --> 02:57.875
And what impressed me was that there wasn't a segregation that I knew that had existed in Delano High School.

02:58.516 --> 02:59.757
I never went to Delano High School.

02:59.777 --> 03:00.478
My brother did.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.656
But he would come home with stories about how racist it was.

03:04.097 --> 03:04.197
Yeah.

03:04.217 --> 03:14.476
You know, how, how the Mexicans and the blacks and the Okies and the Filipinos, you know, the Asians in general were all in separate camps.

03:14.496 --> 03:14.597
Yeah.

03:14.617 --> 03:17.522
You know, and the Japanese probably the ones that were more

03:18.312 --> 03:20.135
Ambitious in that sense, you know.

03:20.155 --> 03:26.204
So it was kind of like, uh, you know, you see like the prison movies where everybody has their own group.

03:26.224 --> 03:26.585
Oh yeah.

03:26.605 --> 03:26.845
Yeah.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.088
And, and Mexican club was called that.

03:29.108 --> 03:31.873
It was the Mexican club, you know?

03:31.893 --> 03:35.678
And, uh, and so they were not apologetic or anything.

03:35.698 --> 03:39.825
It was pretty obvious that that's the way the San Joaquin ballet was.

03:39.845 --> 03:39.965
Right.

03:39.985 --> 03:42.589
And I wasn't really looking forward to going to Delano high school.

03:42.609 --> 03:46.615
So when we moved to San Jose, uh, and I finished

03:46.983 --> 03:48.505
grammar school at Evergreen.

03:48.565 --> 03:50.767
I went to Evergreen Grammar School, eighth grade.

03:52.709 --> 03:54.791
I found out I was ahead of my classmates.

03:54.871 --> 03:59.816
For some reason, I mean, you'd think the San Joaquin Valley would be worse off, but it wasn't.

03:59.877 --> 04:04.581
I was ahead of the students, you know, maybe half a year or something.

04:04.601 --> 04:11.449
You'd say I was teaching them, you know, the teacher got to help me teach and that created enemies, you know, other students hated me.

04:12.730 --> 04:12.830
Yeah.

04:12.850 --> 04:13.211
Yeah.

04:13.231 --> 04:16.534
And so I went to high school then to James Lick and

04:17.088 --> 04:18.851
What I liked was the interracial mixing.

04:18.871 --> 04:20.874
There was no Mexican club, nothing.

04:20.914 --> 04:23.277
It was just, everybody was in the same high school.

04:23.958 --> 04:28.084
And there was racism, but not as virulent as in the Valley.

04:28.986 --> 04:35.636
And also, in my second year, there was a Chicano that was elected as student body president, right?

04:36.036 --> 04:36.877
Eddie Alvarez.

04:37.358 --> 04:38.139
So I still know Eddie.

04:38.179 --> 04:38.900
We're still friends.

04:39.041 --> 04:43.688
He's still involved in education.

04:43.708 --> 04:45.390
And so...

04:45.640 --> 04:54.651
And his brother, Sal Alvarez, also became my classmate and we kind of traded the class presidency there for a while.

04:56.634 --> 05:06.947
So the fact that I was able to become class president in my freshman year was a huge difference for me to be able to have that possibility in San Jose.

05:07.067 --> 05:11.392
So San Jose, as it turns out, was still racist.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.555
I mean, underneath it all, there was still

05:17.062 --> 05:20.285
But the people really expected you to fail.

05:20.305 --> 05:22.728
I mean, if you were Chicano, they were black.

05:24.029 --> 05:26.431
They didn't have too high expectations.

05:26.492 --> 05:31.977
So even though I was a straight-A student, no one actually encouraged me to go to college.

05:31.997 --> 05:34.380
I had to encourage myself.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.123
And then I had a couple of professors that made a huge difference, too.

05:38.384 --> 05:38.764
OK.

05:38.784 --> 05:44.790
Yeah, I was going to ask you about how you found yourself at San Jose State.

05:45.226 --> 05:50.051
How you found yourself at San Jose State, were there mentors?

05:50.091 --> 05:53.154
Was your family encouraging you?

05:55.436 --> 05:58.759
Well, the mentorship began in high school, actually, Mr. Farrell.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.802
That's the one notable.

06:01.822 --> 06:06.507
Actually, I'm very grateful to the teachers that I did have that encouraged me.

06:06.647 --> 06:07.388
I mean, I got to say that.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.449
And they weren't Chicanos.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.450
They weren't Latinos.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.911
They were Anglos, you know.

06:11.692 --> 06:13.474
Middle West, Midwestern kind of types.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.575
And...

06:15.061 --> 06:19.668
Mr. Farrell, Ed Farrell, my English teacher, I'm still in touch with him.

06:19.688 --> 06:21.971
You know, he's in his 90s.

06:23.373 --> 06:24.495
He's getting way up there now.

06:24.515 --> 06:25.417
He's really old.

06:25.437 --> 06:32.147
But the fact is that I felt he respected me.

06:32.167 --> 06:35.872
That made a big difference, you know, that when you're a kid and somebody respects you.

06:37.114 --> 06:43.043
And I felt that he was fair the way that I was graded, you know, in my work.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.201
He was very encouraging.

06:45.401 --> 06:48.405
He's one of the reasons I became a writer, you know, because he was my English teacher.

06:49.046 --> 06:50.427
But I love the sciences as well.

06:50.547 --> 06:56.754
I really, as a matter of fact, when I went to Saturday State, I majored in math and physics my first year.

06:56.774 --> 06:57.876
And I was a straight A student.

06:58.636 --> 07:02.841
It wasn't that I didn't like the sciences, you know, it was why I got out.

07:02.861 --> 07:10.650
I got out because my brother before me, who was a physics major and did receive a degree, became an engineer.

07:11.170 --> 07:12.652
was sort of my advanced party.

07:12.672 --> 07:16.959
You know, he kept told me once he graduated, went out into the field, there's a lot of racism out there.

07:17.700 --> 07:21.006
It doesn't matter if you're an engineer, you know, you, you face that.

07:21.026 --> 07:23.670
So, uh, also he changed.

07:23.950 --> 07:25.994
He, he, he wanted to assimilate.

07:26.114 --> 07:27.957
I mean, he was born in 1937.

07:29.079 --> 07:32.724
So he had a greater fear of poverty than I did.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.067
And he just had to get away from it.

07:34.347 --> 07:36.230
And, uh, and he didn't want to be Mexican either.

07:36.450 --> 07:36.891
So

07:37.124 --> 07:40.988
He was very definitely the Mexican-American who wanted to assimilate.

07:41.008 --> 07:42.050
He married an Anglo wife.

07:42.971 --> 07:44.653
Sweet lady, really.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.233
I loved her.

07:45.614 --> 07:50.259
But the fact is that he had more problems than she did.

07:51.320 --> 08:00.651
And so my reaction as a smaller, younger brother to my older brother,

08:02.453 --> 08:04.275
kind of gravitated, made that change for me.

08:04.816 --> 08:09.160
And he was rejecting his heritage and rejecting the family and not wanting to be Mexican.

08:10.222 --> 08:11.883
I wanted to be Mexican.

08:12.584 --> 08:17.930
So I became more Mexican, you know, and this is between high school and college.

08:17.950 --> 08:22.916
I let my mustache grow out, you know, my hair grow out and started wearing huaraches.

08:22.996 --> 08:23.757
I mean, that whole thing.

08:24.217 --> 08:25.258
This is 1958, 59.

08:25.599 --> 08:31.465
So nothing like that was happening anywhere on campus.

08:31.850 --> 08:35.195
If there were Latinos out there, they didn't call themselves that.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.819
They didn't even call themselves Chicanos.

08:38.059 --> 08:42.466
We were Spanish as far as the world at large was concerned.

08:43.287 --> 08:44.589
And some people didn't want to do that.

08:44.749 --> 08:48.615
I mean, they just did not refer to themselves racially.

08:48.775 --> 08:49.696
They wanted to assimilate.

08:49.736 --> 08:50.838
They wanted to integrate.

08:50.858 --> 08:52.100
They wanted to be American.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.642
Totally, yeah, Anglo.

08:53.842 --> 08:58.069
And so the color of skin, if they were lighter skinned, they got away with it.

08:58.710 --> 09:01.654
If not, like me, if they were darker, they...

09:02.765 --> 09:04.929
They looked back down at their own people.

09:05.209 --> 09:07.373
I mean, I got that kind of reaction from people.

09:07.393 --> 09:14.445
On the other hand, I found that my difference made me popular among Anglos.

09:14.465 --> 09:17.630
So it went the other way, right?

09:17.650 --> 09:20.455
Almost like they exoticized you or something.

09:20.475 --> 09:20.855
Yeah, exactly.

09:21.236 --> 09:21.837
And so...

09:22.323 --> 09:28.351
for dating or whatever purposes that worked out real well, you know, it, it, uh, cause there weren't any Chicanos in the college.

09:28.411 --> 09:34.478
I mean, there weren't any, I looked, I wanted to find, I did find one and I kissed her once.

09:34.498 --> 09:35.720
She called me a dirty Mexican.

09:35.740 --> 09:40.927
So I figured, we're not going to get anywhere here.

09:41.948 --> 09:42.869
Let's go somewhere else.

09:43.710 --> 09:49.157
And they're very different than say the Jewish girls, you know, who were much more, uh,

09:49.745 --> 10:19.313
receptive more receptive yeah all right can i ask you just kind of a clarifying question before we get into the i have two questions but you could see these conversations kind of they go and grow and i'm okay with that if you're okay with it um but uh you had mentioned so your brother was was kind of more interested in assimilating and as kind of

10:19.867 --> 10:23.951
to be rebellious towards him, you wanted to be more Mexican.

10:24.032 --> 10:25.173
Exactly.

10:25.193 --> 10:40.169
And where did you, like, I guess I'm trying to understand, like, where did you, how did you know that being more Mexican was, I'm going to grow my mustache, I'm going to grow my hair, I'm going to wear huaraches.

10:41.030 --> 10:44.734
Like, where did that, where do you think that came from?

10:44.754 --> 10:46.756
Was that something from your family?

10:46.876 --> 10:47.477
Was it

10:48.031 --> 10:52.797
Just, was it like images on movies or, you know what I mean?

10:53.057 --> 10:54.799
Well, we're talking 5960, right?

10:55.420 --> 11:02.829
It's about this time that I read La Raza Cosmica for the first time and I became interested in the Mexican Revolution.

11:04.071 --> 11:17.127
As far as the mustache is concerned, I really just set out to imitate my grandfather, my mother's father, who had a big mustache, big black mustache, you know, and he was tall because I was a little kid, but he was...

11:17.461 --> 11:20.544
The taller branch of the family, you know, my brother got some of that height.

11:21.606 --> 11:25.690
Uh, my brother was almost six feet, five and a half, five and 11 and a half, something like that.

11:25.710 --> 11:31.156
But, uh, my grandfather was tall and thin, you know, and kind of leathery skin.

11:31.176 --> 11:31.857
He'd been a farmer.

11:31.877 --> 11:35.361
He'd been a vaquero in Mexico, but there were no horses here.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.662
So he worked in the fields.

11:36.823 --> 11:37.083
Right.

11:37.103 --> 11:38.925
But, uh, he was well preserved.

11:38.945 --> 11:46.253
I used to love, uh, the way that he looked when he dressed up for Sundays and he had a brown suit that he wore with a Stetson hat.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.696
And it seemed to be very, very dignified.

11:48.716 --> 11:49.877
And I loved this mustache.

11:49.897 --> 11:55.323
So I made the decision early on that I was going to grow a mustache when I grew up, you know, so I did.

11:55.903 --> 12:01.789
And between high school and college is when I started that summer, I started to let it grow out.

12:02.750 --> 12:10.218
And it became, you know, it became bigger and bigger as my college years.

12:10.258 --> 12:12.580
I went from a small mustache into a larger mustache.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.282
It's all white now, but...

12:14.380 --> 12:22.549
But at that time, it was definitely a Mexican image, a Mexican revolution image, you know, Pancho Villa mustache, Zapata mustache.

12:23.169 --> 12:35.863
I wanted that because it seemed to me heroic and it gave me a different image that I needed to go forward in my life in 1960, you know, by that time.

12:37.064 --> 12:40.488
So it comes from family, it comes from the family background.

12:40.508 --> 12:42.750
My dad also had a mustache, not as big.

12:43.152 --> 12:47.900
but he always had a small mustache and mustaches seem to be part of the culture.

12:48.941 --> 13:02.023
And so, uh, I, I still have them, you know, and, uh, I had a girlfriend once she called me be what this, and I loved that, you know, she was an Anglo girlfriend from Texas and she called me, um, be what this and cause she was bilingual.

13:02.043 --> 13:04.407
So I love that aspect of it.

13:04.427 --> 13:08.012
It just seemed very romantic and heroic and the right thing to do.

13:08.874 --> 13:09.615
And, um,

13:10.253 --> 13:15.859
That just got kind of the idea of the huarachis and you could buy white jeans in those days.

13:15.959 --> 13:20.505
And so I started buying white jeans because they looked like calzon blanco, right?

13:20.525 --> 13:28.514
And so the huarachis, the calzon blanco, the t-shirt, the army fatigue jacket, my long hair, the mustache, it became an image.

13:29.295 --> 13:36.383
And when I started to write a column in 1963, that image became El Machete.

13:36.403 --> 13:38.505
That was the name of the column.

13:39.177 --> 13:49.534
So it was a profile that I was projecting into the college world that made me popular and made me feel good about myself.

13:50.816 --> 13:51.998
And it kind of caught on.

13:52.459 --> 13:57.948
You know, within five years, other people were doing it all over the state, you know, different campuses.

13:58.889 --> 14:04.358
But I also made the very significant change of changing my name from Louis to Luis.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.760
I didn't know your name was Louis.

14:06.861 --> 14:11.989
Well, it was Louie actually in grammar school, you know, I was baptized Louis.

14:12.130 --> 14:15.475
I mean, my name is Luis Miguel Valdez, right?

14:15.495 --> 14:21.746
But in grammar school, I distinctly remember one teacher saying, well, you're Louie, your name is Louie.

14:22.728 --> 14:29.940
And so it became Louie throughout grammar school and little Louie on top of that, because I wasn't that tall, you know?

14:30.140 --> 14:32.963
So, but I didn't really like it.

14:33.003 --> 14:34.224
I felt it demeaning.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.086
And by the time I got to high school, I didn't want to be Louie.

14:38.087 --> 14:39.088
I couldn't be Luis yet.

14:39.188 --> 14:40.109
So I became Louis.

14:41.190 --> 14:46.655
My friends knew me as Louis, you know, and that was not good either.

14:46.675 --> 14:48.577
I wasn't happy with, but it was better than Louie.

14:50.779 --> 14:57.225
But when I graduated from high school, it became really important for me to become Luis.

14:57.645 --> 14:59.387
I went back to my original name.

15:00.093 --> 15:05.479
And my Anglo friends had to struggle with it, you know, Luis, you know, they put two syllables instead of one.

15:05.779 --> 15:06.300
Luis.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.301
It's Luis.

15:07.581 --> 15:10.444
And, uh, and that was all right though.

15:10.464 --> 15:11.365
That, that was okay.

15:11.465 --> 15:12.646
I could live with that.

15:12.666 --> 15:13.887
Yeah.

15:13.907 --> 15:13.968
Um.

15:13.988 --> 15:16.730
Did you ever see, uh, who's that guy?

15:16.831 --> 15:23.337
He's, um, he's like a Chicano songwriter, I think, uh, like the Chicano Superman guy.

15:23.858 --> 15:24.919
Do you know who I'm talking about?

15:26.958 --> 15:44.102
There's a story that he tells, and somebody made a little cartoon out of it, but he's talking about that experience of going to school as a young kid and having the white teachers rename you with an anglicized name, right?

15:44.722 --> 15:54.015
And he's telling this story about, you know, we're all there, and one day, you know, this new, you know, Mexican student comes in.

15:54.055 --> 15:55.277
His name is Facundo.

15:55.763 --> 16:24.741
and they're like they're like what are we gonna call him fuck no so they ended up they they just they had to call him yeah and so all the he was saying how all the kids were like you know like he was the hero because he got to keep his name i thought it was a really cute story but um yeah we actually dealt with that experience in no saco nada en la escuela one of our early actors from 68 i believe um

16:25.362 --> 16:31.371
Where there's a Francisco, Pancho, you know, and there's a Paco.

16:31.391 --> 16:36.579
I mean, the name game becomes, but the grammar school teacher changes the name of the student.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.421
That was a personal experience for me.

16:38.481 --> 16:43.749
So I incorporated that right into that acto, but it used to happen to everybody.

16:43.789 --> 16:45.532
It doesn't matter what your background is.

16:45.652 --> 16:47.455
It could be Asian, you know, they'd be changed.

16:47.475 --> 16:48.957
Teachers would be changing names.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.378
In other words, you want to Christianize you.

16:51.398 --> 16:55.183
They want to give you a Christian name, but not that Ruiz isn't.

16:55.203 --> 16:55.744
Yeah.

16:55.764 --> 17:01.913
And, uh, and, but the fact is that they anglicized this is what they were doing, making it easier for them to pronounce.

17:02.754 --> 17:02.874
Right.

17:02.894 --> 17:08.021
Instead of trying to stretch and pronounce your name the way it's supposed to be named.

17:08.041 --> 17:08.923
It's better now.

17:09.023 --> 17:12.067
I mean, I think that we've won that, that particular issue.

17:12.127 --> 17:17.675
You know, I think people are more open to the idea of naming people with their, by calling people by their own names.

17:17.895 --> 17:18.336
Yeah.

17:18.316 --> 17:22.581
And there are many, many languages now, many, many different kinds of names that we see all over.

17:23.182 --> 17:23.602
Yeah.

17:23.622 --> 17:30.010
And well, and I was thinking, you know, a lot of that has to do with kind of like what you were saying is demeaning.

17:30.090 --> 17:30.410
Right.

17:31.111 --> 17:35.597
And it's it's it's just it's a sign of like disrespect.

17:35.717 --> 17:35.977
Right.

17:36.017 --> 17:38.380
Like I can I can call you whatever I want.

17:39.982 --> 17:46.129
And I mean, you still see it like I still get people who are like, oh, can I call you Rosie?

17:46.278 --> 18:10.125
no that's not my name you know yeah yeah yeah like I learned my name okay I learned yours but um yeah did you uh was there did I cut you off no no no um so we were talking about you going from James Lick to San Jose State and then um I think this will probably come out in in my kind of

18:11.388 --> 18:13.431
larger question that I have right now.

18:14.632 --> 18:23.183
But so the first question that I want to take some time to talk about is, what do you consider yourself?

18:23.523 --> 18:26.307
I mean, I know this is an obvious question, but I'm going to ask it.

18:26.928 --> 18:31.834
Do you consider yourself to be a participant of the Chicano movement?

18:31.854 --> 18:36.079
And in what way did you see yourself as being a participant?

18:36.818 --> 18:42.504
I'm actually one of the originators of the Chicano movement, not just a participant, because I was there before the Chicano movement.

18:43.204 --> 18:58.480
If you go to my column, El Machete, which started being published in the fall of 63, what you begin to see in, and again, I only did it for a year and a half because I'll tell you that story.

19:00.041 --> 19:03.585
I began to deal with issues that have been on my mind,

19:04.392 --> 19:10.241
I was involved in the civil rights movement, but I wanted to translate those to my community.

19:10.261 --> 19:16.330
And so I began to address issues of the Mexican-American identity and the Mexican-American community.

19:16.770 --> 19:19.174
Now, Mexican-American was still a new phrase then.

19:19.214 --> 19:23.240
I mean, we didn't call ourselves Mexican-Americans, you know.

19:23.260 --> 19:25.703
We called ourselves Chicanos in the barrio.

19:25.723 --> 19:27.686
If you were Pachuco, you called yourself a Chicano.

19:28.688 --> 19:32.914
You called us a Mexicano, so no one called themselves Hispanics, you know.

19:33.181 --> 19:35.103
Society at large calls us Spanish.

19:35.243 --> 19:38.666
We were Spanish people, but that's ridiculous because I knew we weren't Spanish.

19:39.747 --> 19:39.847
Yeah.

19:39.867 --> 19:52.978
So, uh, the idea of calling yourself Mexican and then qualifying it with the American was really radical at the time, Mexican American, but, uh, it was pretty clumsy, you know, the hyphenated identity.

19:53.879 --> 19:55.780
So they gravitated toward Chicano.

19:55.820 --> 20:02.766
Eventually that became by the mid sixties, uh, that became the term that we approved of within the community.

20:03.421 --> 20:08.409
But, um, it was, uh, it was a whole evolution that took place in terms of consciousness.

20:09.350 --> 20:16.421
And so I was aware that, uh, we were, we were desperately in need of a civil rights movement of our own.

20:18.064 --> 20:22.190
And so El Machete began to deal with those issues, uh, in 63.

20:23.292 --> 20:31.605
And I began to call for some kind of coordinated, uh, social action in 64 and, uh,

20:32.783 --> 20:34.826
And I wanted to do theater at the same time.

20:34.847 --> 20:37.751
So that's a parallel concern.

20:37.772 --> 20:39.174
It became political theater.

20:39.474 --> 20:46.506
And those came together in 65 when I volunteered to join the United Farm Workers, right?

20:46.527 --> 20:55.602
The National Farm Workers Association under Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta and sublimated a lot of my concerns about the Vietnam War.

20:56.240 --> 21:01.885
and about racism in the schools, just to focus on the Grape Strike.

21:02.185 --> 21:16.799
But the creation of El Teatro Campesino on the picket lines of the Atlanta Grape Strike in the fall of 65, eventually led us to attract a larger audience.

21:16.819 --> 21:25.487
First with the March to Sacramento in the spring of 66 and 25 nights in a row, you know, with the

21:26.176 --> 21:32.982
performing on a flatbed truck, gave the teatro a cohesion it had not had before that.

21:33.002 --> 21:36.205
But it also exposed us to a massive audience.

21:36.325 --> 21:41.049
Thousands of people had never seen the teatro, saw us perform on a flatbed truck.

21:41.230 --> 21:49.537
And so, one of the outcomes of the March to Sacramento for the teatro was that we were invited to come to Stanford University to perform.

21:49.557 --> 21:55.002
We came to one of the churches on campus, we performed there.

21:55.268 --> 21:59.696
Uh, we, we were performing Unitarian Church in Los Angeles.

21:59.756 --> 22:14.003
We began to tour and then we started going to colleges and universities, state colleges first, uh, and, uh, began to run into Mexican American students who reacted to what we were doing.

22:14.371 --> 22:19.956
And the Huelga had a tremendous impact on the student population at different colleges.

22:19.976 --> 22:29.045
And so, especially around Cinco de Mayo, you know, they began to organize springtime events in support of the United Farm Workers, but that eventually became a cultural event on its own.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.808
And so Teatro became part of that.

22:31.828 --> 22:43.939
Even after we left the United Farm Workers, that was our source of income that we were able to go to the Cinco de Mayo or at the fall 16 de septiembre, although those weren't as profitable because

22:44.358 --> 22:47.942
The students had just gotten to campus and they didn't have time to really organize it.

22:47.962 --> 22:52.788
So we'd have some shows in the fall, but the major ones were in the springtime in the summer.

22:53.950 --> 23:01.299
And, and that's when we began then to define through the work, uh, some of these Chicano ideas.

23:01.319 --> 23:11.732
And when we left Delano in the, in September of 67 and moved to Delray, 60 miles north by Fresno, um,

23:12.910 --> 23:23.885
our first act was to try to redefine our work, to open up, uh, our subject matter from the Huelga into the war in Vietnam, into education.

23:23.945 --> 23:38.325
I mentioned , uh, our public reading of Corky Gonzalez, I am Joaquin, you know, which she had given to me in a mimeograph copy, uh, the summer of 67 in our national tour.

23:39.567 --> 23:39.627
Um,

23:40.028 --> 23:45.954
All of that then began to promulgate and also focus on Chicano concepts and ideas.

23:45.974 --> 23:58.667
And our articles of incorporation for El Centro Campesino Cultural in 68 defined what our purpose was, was to deliver the tools of the arts into the hands of the working class.

23:59.688 --> 24:05.493
And at the same time, we're talking about our Mexican American heritage and the need to define that politically.

24:06.274 --> 24:09.057
So that was in early 68.

24:09.644 --> 24:12.528
And we took those ideas straight into campus.

24:13.690 --> 24:17.616
And at that time, there were stirrings going on in Los Angeles.

24:18.697 --> 24:21.121
Again, we were part and parcel of that.

24:21.141 --> 24:29.853
We'd go to campuses in Los Angeles and stir up ideas and get people excited about what's coming up, what's happening.

24:30.594 --> 24:34.580
That led to the creation of La Raza newspaper, you know, by Elia Cerrisco.

24:34.820 --> 24:35.201
Yeah.

24:35.481 --> 24:38.065
The one that's, it's from out of UCLA, right?

24:39.344 --> 24:41.868
Well, Eliezer was not at UCLA at the time.

24:42.729 --> 24:55.667
Risco was someone that I'd met in San Francisco, a Cuban American who happened to be the boyfriend of my girlfriend's ex-roommate from back East.

24:56.849 --> 24:59.092
It's complicated, but she shows up.

24:59.132 --> 25:06.182
Her name was Ruth Robinson, and she turns out to be also an early participant in the Chicano movement with Eliezer, Risco.

25:07.063 --> 25:08.625
And they went...

25:08.858 --> 25:11.161
Risco came and worked in Delano for a while.

25:11.321 --> 25:12.162
He was asked to leave.

25:12.503 --> 25:23.857
Actually, that's a different story, but he went to LA, East LA with Ruth and they started La Raza, the newspaper, which eventually led to the walkouts in LA.

25:24.598 --> 25:35.592
So all of that is really part and parcel of that whole activity that was happening in early 68, that a lot of us were in contact, we were friends, you know, I knew

25:36.010 --> 25:40.735
most of the early leaders of the Mexican, of the Chicano, uh, movement.

25:41.496 --> 25:47.702
And, um, and we shared ideas and, and shared events, you know, and inspired each other.

25:48.643 --> 25:52.827
And I saw that this was happening at every level, you know, it was not just civil rights.

25:52.887 --> 25:58.573
It was also art and culture and cultural identity.

25:58.593 --> 26:04.819
And, uh, and it was an exciting time because most of us were still in our twenties, you know, it was, uh,

26:05.137 --> 26:10.522
And younger, we had teenagers in the teatro at the time, so it's important.

26:12.083 --> 26:29.738
The column that you were talking about, El Machete, from 1963, so was that affiliated with something to do with San Jose State, or was that just something totally independent that you were doing and putting out?

26:29.979 --> 26:30.579
How was that?

26:31.560 --> 26:32.961
Where was it being distributed?

26:33.041 --> 26:35.143
Were you just printing it?

26:35.275 --> 26:36.777
handing it out to people.

26:36.897 --> 26:37.338
No, no.

26:37.358 --> 26:41.404
Eccéntrico is the magazine that it appeared in.

26:41.424 --> 26:51.319
Now, it's like a shopper's newspaper in a way, but it was really the only publication that dealt with Mexicans in any way in San Jose.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.043
And in the state, actually, there were some in LA.

26:54.664 --> 27:01.554
L'Opinon, I'm sure, was a full-fledged newspaper in Los Angeles, but I didn't have access to that.

27:01.574 --> 27:02.575
I was in San Jose.

27:02.615 --> 27:04.438
So, uh,

27:05.161 --> 27:11.150
Umberto Garza, I think was the publisher and, uh, he took a liking to me personally.

27:11.170 --> 27:14.135
And so he offered me the opportunity to write this column.

27:14.576 --> 27:23.910
And I don't remember how we met, but he was, uh, he was a gentleman and, uh, he had been publishing this for several years.

27:23.970 --> 27:25.633
El Eccéntrico was really

27:27.301 --> 27:31.426
something you could get at the grocery store, the Mexicans in grocery stores, you could buy it.

27:31.887 --> 27:32.207
Yeah.

27:32.628 --> 27:36.132
Uh, but it was a small little pamphlet, basically.

27:36.252 --> 27:43.902
Kind of like, uh, La Oferta or like the Metro that they have in San Jose, like... Even smaller, actually.

27:43.922 --> 27:46.845
It was tiny, you know?

27:46.865 --> 27:46.965
Yeah.

27:46.986 --> 27:53.614
But they carried news of the social clubs that existed in San Jose, the dances, nothing political whatsoever.

27:53.734 --> 27:57.038
I introduced a political element, uh,

27:57.608 --> 28:02.216
To the dismay of the older generation, they, they weren't happy with my ideas.

28:02.236 --> 28:04.961
No, they, they were fearful that I was a communist.

28:05.101 --> 28:11.632
They said, you know, but who is this guy who's this Chicano Ramplon, you know, that's coming out of the woodwork here.

28:12.394 --> 28:14.197
But, uh, I was a new generation.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.140
I was a voice and I think, uh,

28:16.964 --> 28:25.574
Don Humberto knew this, you know, he, he, he sensed that I was speaking for this whole new generation that was about to explode on the world.

28:26.435 --> 28:40.292
Again, because I was born in 1940, I was ahead of the baby boomers, you know, by six years, six to 10 years, you know, so most of the people that I began to, uh, impact on were about 10 years younger.

28:41.033 --> 28:41.233
Yeah.

28:42.125 --> 28:51.597
That was, uh, these were the Chicano boomers, you know, that came around, came around and, um, Lupe, for instance, is five years younger than me.

28:51.617 --> 28:53.460
She's not a boomer exactly, but she's 1945.

28:53.480 --> 29:07.558
So, um, these are very impressionable ages, you know, the early twenties, you're looking for something to believe in, to focus your adult, you know, energies and, and powers.

29:07.808 --> 29:18.719
And so it's a good time for people to find mentors and, and, and if nothing had been, nothing was there for me before that I had to go to a different source of inspiration.

29:18.799 --> 29:23.864
The theater gave me some of that, the Yiddish theater, believe it or not.

29:23.885 --> 29:30.011
Uh, I became aware of Yiddish culture and Jewish culture through girlfriends in college.

29:30.732 --> 29:36.077
So I became aware of Shalom Aleichem and other writers, you know, from the Jewish, uh,

29:37.053 --> 29:38.175
uh, culture.

29:38.435 --> 29:44.063
And, um, and I said, that's, that's something that I would like to do in my own context.

29:44.083 --> 29:57.563
The Irish revolution of the early 20th century, uh, William Butler Yeats and John Singh were also playwrights also influenced me in that movement of the Irish to establish their own identity in Ireland.

29:58.685 --> 30:03.011
And, and the liberation of Ireland from England made a lot of sense to me as a Chicano.

30:03.051 --> 30:06.216
I said, Hey, I can, I can see how that parallels my history.

30:06.517 --> 30:07.758
And so I want to do that.

30:07.998 --> 30:10.781
I want to do that in my own context.

30:11.802 --> 30:20.189
And so as it turns out, I was able to do that because I had the tool and my interest in the theater.

30:20.469 --> 30:23.312
I took the theater and began to channel that.

30:23.752 --> 30:35.663
In my studies in college, I discovered the American theater in the 30s specifically, but the political theater had roots all the way back to the early 20th century with the Wobblies,

30:36.200 --> 30:52.926
And you have a number of key figures, you know, that are political figures, influenced me in terms of the early labor movement had theater productions.

30:53.412 --> 31:08.312
And that combined with my studies of Mexican culture and what was happening in the 1920s, not just with the muralists, but also with the Vasconcelos as education minister, he started sending out teatros campesinos into the countryside.

31:08.592 --> 31:10.835
That's what they were called, teatros campesinos.

31:10.855 --> 31:13.058
These were peasant theaters that went out.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.123
They weren't teaching people politics.

31:15.143 --> 31:18.372
They were teaching people how to brush their teeth and how to delouse their children.

31:18.813 --> 31:22.101
But I liked the idea of going out into the countryside.

31:22.162 --> 31:23.806
I thought that makes sense to me.

31:23.826 --> 31:28.498
And I also learned about Garcia Lorca, Federico Garcia Lorca in the 1930s.

31:29.120 --> 31:36.972
traveling to the Spanish countryside in a truck, you know, with students from the University of Madrid and performing in the villages and performing his plays.

31:37.834 --> 31:43.002
These were just things that I learned about in my studies, but I applied them to my experience.

31:43.022 --> 31:48.310
And I said, the idea of a truck of a theater company going out makes perfect sense to me.

31:48.330 --> 31:53.558
I can do that because I had been in the labor camps and I could take those elements and

31:53.960 --> 31:58.247
make them gel into, into something that I could do in my time.

31:58.989 --> 32:06.421
What I didn't have any in the college that had prepared me in any way was the form of theater that I needed to be able to do.

32:06.461 --> 32:15.457
I knew I couldn't have curtains and the stage and all that, you know, out in the labor camp, but that came, that idea was expanded when I joined the San Francisco Mime Troupe.

32:15.477 --> 32:18.482
Then after I graduated in 64, I moved to San Francisco.

32:18.918 --> 32:30.918
And I, for a year, and I worked with the San Francisco Mime Troupe and we were performing in the parks, doing comedia, you know, with masks, putting up our own stage, drawing up an audience, you know, by banging the drum.

32:30.938 --> 32:32.000
And I said, this is perfect.

32:32.020 --> 32:33.482
This is exactly what I need.

32:33.722 --> 32:42.597
And so my instincts kicked in, you know, I talk about epigenetic memory, you know, maybe, maybe there's something in my background that, that

32:42.965 --> 32:47.829
propelled me in that direction, but I saw all those elements coming together pretty clearly.

32:47.849 --> 32:53.374
The idea of using theater to espouse not only political ideals, but also cultural identity.

32:54.255 --> 33:07.007
And then what I needed was a place for all of that to come together and happen like a, like a crucible, you know, and that became the, the United Farmer because that became Delano.

33:07.968 --> 33:08.088
Right.

33:08.108 --> 33:10.710
Ironically I was born in Delano, you know, half my,

33:11.095 --> 33:13.979
family was on strike and the other half was scabbing.

33:14.039 --> 33:21.028
So, so I had like a family involvement in Delano and an old score to settle with racist Delano.

33:21.689 --> 33:35.828
So the idea of going back and bringing theater, uh, and volunteering basically with no money whatsoever to, um, try to expose these ideas in that context, you know, made a lot of sense to me.

33:36.028 --> 33:36.529
It was

33:37.420 --> 33:39.662
It gave me power, gave me energy.

33:40.082 --> 33:42.584
And, and of course I was in my twenties, mid twenties.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.906
So that was natural anyway.

33:44.926 --> 33:49.170
It was the kind of thing that, uh, it was the right place to be at the right time.

33:49.830 --> 33:51.812
I was very fortunate.

33:52.032 --> 34:03.882
If it, if there was like a sense of fate or like destiny, that all these things are kind of coming together for you or, you know, not coming together for you, but that you're seeing these connections.

34:04.723 --> 34:07.225
And then here's this thing.

34:07.846 --> 34:10.350
that happens in your hometown.

34:11.151 --> 34:11.452
Yeah.

34:11.512 --> 34:15.378
Well, I believe in the wave principle, you know, the power of the wave.

34:16.139 --> 34:18.623
It's the way that energy is transported.

34:18.643 --> 34:19.865
It's the way that light works.

34:19.945 --> 34:22.309
It's the way that water works, our seas.

34:22.329 --> 34:27.598
And it's also the way that human culture operates on a global scale.

34:28.539 --> 34:33.988
And in the 1960s, the wave worldwide had built to such a height

34:33.968 --> 34:56.078
The civil rights movement was writing the crest of this wave and it was causing it at the same time was black people pushing, you know, from beneath to try to lift their heads up, you know, out of the sand that, um, that led to the creation of this way, but there were liberation movements all over the world, uh, after world war II.

34:56.513 --> 35:00.538
there was a great deal of hope that maybe the world would be different after this massive slaughter.

35:01.680 --> 35:11.973
And, uh, and so that way built and built and built and, uh, Cesar Chavez was able to plug into it, you know, uh, certainly Martin Luther King.

35:11.993 --> 35:20.664
Uh, and it, it, that way broke eventually it, it, in the seventies, it kind of like broke like a wave and it went off on the sand and we went into the Reagan years.

35:21.786 --> 35:21.846
Um,

35:22.332 --> 35:23.714
The wave comes and goes.

35:23.754 --> 35:25.897
Sometimes it's high, sometimes it's low.

35:26.437 --> 35:29.902
I don't think it's been as high as it was in the 60s since then.

35:30.603 --> 35:32.165
It'll be there eventually.

35:32.185 --> 35:36.891
It'll come up again and rise to a new height because that's just the way life is.

35:36.951 --> 35:38.152
It's the wave principle.

35:38.753 --> 35:41.056
It's the up and down, you know, it's the coming and going.

35:41.236 --> 35:52.170
And so I was, again, very fortunate to be 25 years old in 1965, to find Cesar Chavez and the Loras Huerta doing what they were doing in Delano.

35:52.707 --> 36:03.721
again, where I was born, and then to go back and do that, having prepared myself consciously and unconsciously for a career in the theater.

36:05.203 --> 36:19.542
I have some other questions, but before I forget this one, was there any concern on the part of people, whether it was Chavez or Dolores,

36:20.213 --> 36:27.687
Um, was there any concern, like who is this guy coming here and trying to do plays?

36:30.171 --> 36:38.847
Well, I'm sure there was, I mean, they were open to volunteers coming in and there were a lot of student, Anglo student volunteers, you know, coming to Delano to help.

36:39.637 --> 36:43.908
A good source of energy without having to pay anybody, you know?

36:43.928 --> 36:50.845
So, and a lot of passion, a lot of idealism that eventually got them in trouble with the union, but

36:51.348 --> 36:53.870
At the top, I mean, it was, we just needed bodies.

36:53.890 --> 36:54.631
We needed people.

36:54.651 --> 36:55.552
So I was one of those.

36:55.612 --> 36:56.933
I came in, but I was a Chicano.

36:56.953 --> 36:57.634
That was the difference.

36:58.014 --> 37:09.545
And not only that, I mean, I had met Cesar when I was six years old and I had to remind him that one of his running partners in Delano was my cousin, Billy Miranda, who was a Pachuco when they were both Pachucos.

37:10.226 --> 37:12.428
So I think that family connection made a difference.

37:14.090 --> 37:17.693
It doesn't mean that Cesar trusted me implicitly.

37:18.348 --> 37:27.719
But he heard me, you know, he heard my spiel and the pitch that I wanted to organize a theater up by and for farm workers.

37:27.739 --> 37:40.053
And at that time, just a year before the Free Southern Theater had started out of New York and been going into the South to perform, you know, in segregated areas in the South.

37:41.014 --> 37:43.697
And that was a big inspiration for me because

37:44.302 --> 37:47.145
The San Joaquin Valley was my South, you know, I was going down there.

37:48.006 --> 37:54.014
So, uh, I went there without any expectations that I had money or a grant or funding of any kind.

37:54.074 --> 37:57.418
I just kind of threw myself at the mercy of Cesar and the people.

37:57.458 --> 38:00.641
And I said, look, I have this idea and if it's possible, I would like to do this.

38:01.182 --> 38:03.945
And he said, fine, but there's no money to do theater and delay.

38:03.965 --> 38:04.786
No, there are no actors.

38:04.806 --> 38:05.487
There's no stage.

38:06.468 --> 38:06.588
Right.

38:06.609 --> 38:08.691
You know, we were on the picket line night and day.

38:08.711 --> 38:09.612
Do you still want to do it?

38:09.652 --> 38:11.254
And I said, absolutely.

38:11.791 --> 38:16.178
And as it turns out, the picket line was a place where Teatro Campesino was born.

38:17.421 --> 38:20.846
It was activism directly in the fields to try to bring the scabs out.

38:20.946 --> 38:27.898
And then eventually we gravitated to the Friday night meetings and that gave us a different stage, a different, there were no stages.

38:27.918 --> 38:32.766
I mean, it was just a little space open on the floor when we performed.

38:34.029 --> 38:34.910
It was raw.

38:34.930 --> 38:35.231
Okay.

38:35.251 --> 38:37.194
But I mean, I felt the energy of it.

38:37.214 --> 38:37.815
I felt

38:38.521 --> 38:50.603
the destiny of it, that this was my destiny, that this is what I had to do in order to, to bring all these elements in my life together, that this was the right thing for me to do at the time.

38:50.623 --> 38:54.491
And, and, uh, fortunately Cesar was open to it.

38:55.012 --> 39:01.744
Um, certain Dolores was open to it so long as I didn't get in the way, you know, and, uh,

39:02.230 --> 39:06.657
That's kind of what I was wondering about in terms of concerns.

39:07.398 --> 39:19.696
Because, I mean, so just thinking about here on the one hand, you have a group that's organizing for a very specific purpose, which is labor, right?

39:19.716 --> 39:23.361
They're trying to improve working conditions for the farm worker.

39:23.915 --> 39:25.978
pay, whatever it is, right?

39:26.619 --> 39:32.668
And then here comes Luis with, I have this theater, teatro idea, right?

39:33.208 --> 39:44.865
But not only are you, or maybe I'm misunderstanding, but not only are you also talking about the farm worker issues, but you're bringing in extra stuff, right?

39:44.885 --> 39:49.151
You're talking about the history, you're talking about identity and culture.

39:49.872 --> 39:51.795
Or was that not happening...

39:52.130 --> 39:57.375
at that point in time when you were, uh, starting in Delano.

39:57.976 --> 40:03.121
Well, Cesar told me Percy, he said, those are his words.

40:03.141 --> 40:05.003
I like you because you're, you're a Chicano.

40:05.023 --> 40:05.624
You're one of us.

40:05.644 --> 40:05.864
Right.

40:06.024 --> 40:08.026
And, and that, that impressed me.

40:08.066 --> 40:08.667
I said, great.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.670
But you know, there's, there's something else.

40:11.730 --> 40:14.533
The year before I went to Delano, I had been to Cuba.

40:15.754 --> 40:19.858
After graduating, one of the things that happened there, uh,

40:20.767 --> 40:30.076
from San Jose is I joined a group that was going to Cuba, uh, with a group of 75 American students.

40:30.096 --> 40:32.299
And it was a radical thing to do.

40:32.319 --> 40:33.980
It was actually my roommate who started it.

40:34.040 --> 40:37.404
He's the one who was going to Cuba and he says, Hey, I'm going, you want to come?

40:37.444 --> 40:42.569
And so, uh, and he was, uh, Polish American, Frank Tchorka.

40:42.589 --> 40:45.812
He was an artist, activist, and, um,

40:47.142 --> 40:48.964
I said, yeah, that's intriguing.

40:48.984 --> 40:51.768
You know, it seems a long way to go, but I said, yeah, how can we do this?

40:51.788 --> 40:52.990
How can I afford it?

40:53.030 --> 40:54.352
And they said, no, they're paying for everything.

40:55.093 --> 40:57.376
So Cuba paid for the whole trip.

40:57.396 --> 41:02.423
And, uh, and as it turned out, Frank, uh, didn't even go to Cuba.

41:02.503 --> 41:03.905
He went to Mississippi summer.

41:03.925 --> 41:08.591
He went to registered voters in the South, he and his wife at the time, you know?

41:08.611 --> 41:13.858
And, um, so I ended up going to Cuba and, uh,

41:14.817 --> 41:18.021
I'd get a passport and it was the first time I'd ever flown any place.

41:18.081 --> 41:26.292
So we, and it was all very, very, what can I say?

41:26.432 --> 41:27.473
Secretively done.

41:27.493 --> 41:29.376
You know, the FBI actually was on us.

41:29.396 --> 41:33.761
They were watching us at every step, but we gathered in the Haight-Ashbury.

41:33.781 --> 41:40.690
I remember spent one night there and then we went to the airport and the West Coast group flew to New York and we

41:40.973 --> 42:01.118
We got together with the New York, the East coast branch, and then we flew to Paris and spent the night in Paris and then flew to Prague, Czechoslovakia, and picked up the Cubana de Aviacion from there and flew all the way back to Shannon, Ireland and Newfoundland and Gander, Newfoundland, and then Havana.

42:01.719 --> 42:08.567
So it was 40 hours in the air to get to Cuba and the fifth year of the revolution, uh,

42:09.087 --> 42:17.757
We met Che Guevara, I have a picture, you know, with a photo, meeting Che Guevara and played baseball with Fidel.

42:17.797 --> 42:18.918
I have another picture of that.

42:19.919 --> 42:23.583
And met other students and other activists along the way.

42:24.624 --> 42:30.971
But we were definitely Americans who were definitely different than the Cubans.

42:32.212 --> 42:32.833
Yeah.

42:34.653 --> 42:43.046
they voided my passport as a result, you know, and, uh, we could have gone to jail actually if they had insisted on doing that.

42:43.066 --> 42:44.589
It was a very radical thing to do.

42:44.789 --> 42:45.310
Okay.

42:45.330 --> 42:52.441
In, in the summer of 1964 and that was pointed out to Caesar right away.

42:52.461 --> 43:00.694
So if he had any reason to distrust me, it would have, it would have been that, but because of the family connection, uh,

43:01.265 --> 43:03.707
He didn't reject me.

43:03.727 --> 43:04.588
He allowed me to stay.

43:05.729 --> 43:08.692
And I explained to him.

43:08.712 --> 43:11.875
I told him the story of where I went to Cuba and what had happened.

43:13.296 --> 43:15.278
He was not shocked in any way.

43:16.218 --> 43:23.345
Although I do think there was a part of him that was wary because there were all kinds of communists that were trying to participate in the farm workers movement.

43:23.945 --> 43:26.288
And some in very helpful ways.

43:26.308 --> 43:31.272
But he eventually separated himself, including from me.

43:31.876 --> 43:33.679
purged all those people out.

43:33.699 --> 43:34.521
They were too radical.

43:35.542 --> 43:42.555
Uh, he himself, I think was a naturally born socialist, you know, like Dolores, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that.

43:42.595 --> 43:43.757
I applaud that.

43:43.777 --> 43:49.106
And, uh, we live in a country that had practices, socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor.

43:50.128 --> 43:50.328
Right.

43:50.348 --> 43:55.858
And so, um, I think that what Cesar was trying to do was establish, uh,

43:56.395 --> 44:17.863
social justice you know in the fields which still doesn't exist yeah um can i also ask you about um so during this time you had mentioned that you went to delano talked to caesar and was like i want to put together this group i want to do this yeah and

44:18.653 --> 44:21.557
Who, so who was like part of that?

44:21.577 --> 44:22.118
Who was it?

44:22.138 --> 44:24.781
Was it you, your brother, Danny, right?

44:25.162 --> 44:25.523
Not yet.

44:25.723 --> 44:26.384
Oh, not yet.

44:27.605 --> 44:30.630
No, the first person that I ran into was Agustin Lira.

44:31.351 --> 44:33.173
And he played the guitar, which was great.

44:34.555 --> 44:35.897
And I met with him.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.844
I met him, because I was looking for people who just could play the guitar.

44:40.884 --> 44:42.987
And I saw I'm playing the guitar, and I said, are you interested?

44:43.027 --> 44:44.889
And he was.

44:45.931 --> 44:46.872
But...

44:47.712 --> 44:51.516
He had to wait for me to come and go because I had to come back to San Francisco and finish my business.

44:52.357 --> 44:59.604
I met him, I think it was either early October, about a month before I actually moved back to Delano.

45:00.985 --> 45:01.706
I made a foray.

45:01.726 --> 45:09.473
I went in there and talked to Cesar and I talked to everybody and met, I met Augie and I said, we're going to need songs, you know?

45:09.613 --> 45:13.097
So, and he was a gifted musician.

45:13.177 --> 45:15.679
He still is, you know, he's a maestro as far as that's concerned.

45:15.699 --> 45:17.181
He composed some beautiful songs.

45:17.501 --> 45:17.601
Yeah.

45:18.425 --> 45:19.526
But he was very, very young.

45:19.606 --> 45:24.571
I mean, he must've been early twenties, you know, 21, 22 at the time.

45:24.591 --> 45:27.654
So he had all the passions of youth, basically.

45:28.254 --> 45:35.741
Uh, but he wasn't the type that would come out and start playing raucous corridos.

45:35.761 --> 45:37.523
You know, that was my background.

45:37.603 --> 45:39.104
I wanted to do raucous corridos.

45:40.005 --> 45:42.988
He'd do soft, very romantic, very beautiful songs.

45:43.288 --> 45:47.132
Uh, the March de Saga la Peregrinacion is his, you know, um,

45:48.884 --> 45:52.569
he did a number of songs that are lyrical and very beautiful.

45:52.589 --> 46:02.362
Uh, but, uh, together we, we drummed up a different, uh, repertoire of songs that we could take from the civil rights movement and translate them into Spanish.

46:02.442 --> 46:05.987
I knew the translating for the most part and then we'd set them to the music.

46:06.047 --> 46:06.267
Right.

46:06.427 --> 46:10.713
And, uh, so he was one guitar and two guys, you know, basically.

46:10.753 --> 46:11.975
So that's how it started.

46:13.276 --> 46:17.642
Uh, then we, I had, I set up a workshop in November, uh,

46:18.500 --> 46:25.028
There in the union office, actually there's a photo of me talking to the workers, the very first movement, first meeting really for the Teatro.

46:25.309 --> 46:30.916
It was even filmed by a UCLA student group that came in, film students.

46:31.216 --> 46:41.449
And I got that footage later from their teacher who happened to be a producer at Universal Studios, Verna Fields, the editor to Jaws.

46:41.469 --> 46:46.195
Anyway, she said, I have this movie of you, this film footage of you talking to farm workers.

46:46.495 --> 46:47.916
copy and so I got it from her.

46:48.837 --> 46:53.402
But in any case, um, and what it took was improvisation.

46:53.422 --> 46:58.407
This is where my, the techniques I'd picked up in the San Francisco Mime group began to work for me.

46:58.488 --> 47:01.491
I set up improvisational techniques and I hung signs on people.

47:02.191 --> 47:05.155
And then people would start, saw what I was doing.

47:05.255 --> 47:07.677
They, they, they, the light turned on.

47:07.697 --> 47:08.718
They said, Whoa, okay.

47:08.918 --> 47:10.720
I see, I see what you're doing.

47:11.281 --> 47:14.224
And out of that came again, the first group, Auggie was, you know,

47:14.609 --> 47:17.452
Uh, Felipe Cantu was one of our early recruits.

47:17.813 --> 47:18.974
He started out as a scab.

47:19.014 --> 47:23.920
We found him in the fields, breaking the strike, but he saw the Teatro doing stuff.

47:23.940 --> 47:30.348
We saw us singing songs and doing ridiculous stuff up on top of the flatbed truck.

47:30.368 --> 47:31.609
And so he was a natural clown.

47:31.689 --> 47:33.472
He gravitated to us immediately.

47:34.573 --> 47:43.924
And so a lot of the personality of the Teatro Campesino really relates, it goes back to Felipe Cantu, you know, his, his personality, he gave his personality.

47:44.528 --> 47:47.151
Tudonso Tako and other characters that he played.

47:48.192 --> 47:51.916
But there were others that joined briefly and some that stayed longer.

47:52.676 --> 47:57.201
Danny came after the March of Sacramento, he joined us.

47:58.422 --> 48:04.068
We had to get out of San Jose and my mother said, take him, you're getting in trouble over here.

48:04.869 --> 48:08.673
So he came and joined us, but he was only 17 at the time.

48:08.773 --> 48:12.797
So it was, it was a real challenge for me.

48:12.878 --> 48:21.529
to have, I was 26 by then, but to have a 17-year-old brother who wanted to be 17, you know?

48:21.549 --> 48:21.650
Yeah.

48:21.670 --> 48:24.033
And, but he played the guitar.

48:24.393 --> 48:25.294
Danny played the guitar.

48:25.334 --> 48:26.496
So then we had two guitars.

48:27.257 --> 48:29.139
So he and Augie became, you know, a duet.

48:29.400 --> 48:36.349
And Augie's brother joined eventually, you know, toward the end there.

48:36.369 --> 48:37.991
And he also played the guitar.

48:38.231 --> 48:40.995
So eventually, I mean, we had a group of

48:41.718 --> 48:44.423
five, six, seven, eight people that started touring.

48:45.505 --> 48:49.933
And one woman, you know, Carolina Franco, who would come and go with us.

48:49.993 --> 48:53.519
Her parents didn't want her to go too far, but she had a lovely voice.

48:53.539 --> 49:04.498
She could really sing, but we got her into some of the actors, you know, we couldn't get any other women because the parents or the husbands and boyfriends would not put up with it.

49:04.538 --> 49:06.662
They didn't want to see any women acting.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.162
with these payasos, right?

49:09.743 --> 49:11.866
They didn't trust us out on tour.

49:12.467 --> 49:14.871
No, sir, you're not taking my daughter out on the road.

49:15.752 --> 49:17.154
So I understood that.

49:18.176 --> 49:21.601
So if we had female roles, you'd put men in drag.

49:21.641 --> 49:22.942
Basically, that's how we did it.

49:22.963 --> 49:28.110
And all the farm workers cracked up in Delano, especially that we were doing that.

49:28.377 --> 49:29.859
But we got some real crazies.

49:29.879 --> 49:35.006
The people that were willing to do that were really naturally crazy and unreliable.

49:35.386 --> 49:37.829
So the theater was really volatile at the time.

49:37.849 --> 49:47.842
It was wild and it was raucous, you know, but there were only a few really stable personalities.

49:48.703 --> 49:54.891
We had one Anglo volunteer, Doug Rippey, who joined, he came from Fresno, he had his own pickup truck.

49:55.057 --> 50:00.021
just before the, the, our first national tour in 1967, the summer of 67.

50:00.162 --> 50:07.888
And he played the guitarron and he was tall and blonde, you know, so he towered over all of us with a guitarron.

50:09.149 --> 50:16.496
And, uh, and then he had his truck, which had a canopy so we could put all our stuff nice and safe in his pickup truck.

50:17.477 --> 50:24.523
And so he, he left Delano with us to Delray and it turns out his father was, uh, Dr. Rippey.

50:25.263 --> 50:33.757
at Fresno State, and we had dinner at his house one night after we left Delano, and we needed dinner, really.

50:33.817 --> 50:36.341
We didn't always have enough to eat.

50:36.421 --> 50:39.146
Yeah, so we're very grateful they invited us to dinner.

50:40.007 --> 50:46.638
But then he proposed, he says, well, we have this thing in Fresno State called the Experimental College.

50:46.658 --> 50:47.980
I would like to teach a course.

50:49.242 --> 50:53.848
And so that was the beginning of Chicano studies at Fresno State in the state of California, actually.

50:55.070 --> 51:09.088
This is January of 68, you know, and, um, but it came to that connection of Doug Rippey who had volunteered to join the strike and then became a musician in the teatro and then eventually took us to his father, which brought me to Fresno State.

51:09.489 --> 51:11.431
I mean, all these things are consequential, right?

51:11.451 --> 51:12.152
They're connected.

51:12.833 --> 51:17.359
But the fact is that that early group, uh, of

51:18.622 --> 51:28.335
The teatro, you know, it was Auggie, it was Felipe, Danny, it was, we had a Filipino called Conrado Villaseñor, Beto Reyes.

51:28.455 --> 51:36.906
I mean, these are all characters that had different strengths and weaknesses, you know, and they were not actors.

51:36.926 --> 51:42.854
They were farm workers and they weren't interested in making a life in the theater.

51:42.894 --> 51:46.038
They couldn't conceive of it, you know, except maybe Felipe.

51:46.098 --> 51:48.561
Felipe had some wild dreams and maybe...

51:48.710 --> 51:51.915
And as it is, he ended up being the snake man in La Bamba.

51:52.096 --> 51:54.460
He's the guy with the rattlesnakes.

51:54.720 --> 51:56.443
That's Felipe Cantu.

51:56.463 --> 52:12.810
And he was already dying from throat cancer at the time, so we had to mic him to get his voice, which is very hoarse in the movie, but his children were very happy and proud that their daddy made it into a Hollywood film, right?

52:13.904 --> 52:20.332
Mostly the campesinos had a very short perspective on what we were doing.

52:20.352 --> 52:26.540
There's one campesino who joined us and he studied this.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.624
He looked at us improvising for a while.

52:29.644 --> 52:34.410
And then, uh, I asked him because I was trying to recruit him and I said, what do you think Marcos?

52:35.712 --> 52:41.639
He says, I don't know if you're a genius or you're an idiot.

52:42.140 --> 52:43.101
That's what he told me.

52:43.705 --> 52:47.489
So he performed with us once and then he shined it off.

52:47.589 --> 52:52.395
He, he, but he became one of the best organizers that the union ever had in the boycott.

52:52.795 --> 52:52.915
Right.

52:52.935 --> 53:01.565
He didn't even know how to read and write, but he was very intelligent and, and gutsy, you know, he was able to go into situations where no one else would be.

53:01.886 --> 53:02.687
And he wasn't that big.

53:02.707 --> 53:06.771
He was about my size, you know, but I mean, he could walk into a bar and hold his own.

53:07.872 --> 53:11.957
And, uh, he, he, I heard him give a speech later at Delano where he,

53:12.747 --> 53:22.820
He talked that the irony of his going to Boston on the boycott was that Cesar was recruiting people to go on the national boycott.

53:22.840 --> 53:25.288
And he heard, who wants to go to Boston?

53:25.792 --> 53:27.794
But what he heard is who wants to go to Austin?

53:30.478 --> 53:33.301
And he'd been in Texas, you know?

53:33.321 --> 53:34.803
So he said, Austin, yay, right here.

53:35.764 --> 53:37.466
So it turns out he wasn't going to Austin.

53:37.486 --> 53:39.448
He was going to Boston.

53:39.468 --> 53:45.736
So he ends up going to Boston and he ends up organizing, being one of the major organizers of the Boston boycott.

53:45.756 --> 53:48.559
So he ends up giving speeches at Harvard and Yale.

53:48.579 --> 53:52.604
And he still couldn't read and write.

53:52.624 --> 53:53.445
He used to laugh.

53:54.046 --> 53:55.748
So this guy was in the teatro.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.782
came and went very quickly.

53:58.403 --> 54:01.747
I would have loved to have had him in there, but he, he, that was not his thing.

54:01.767 --> 54:05.051
He was, he was not, uh, he was not a comedian.

54:05.231 --> 54:06.052
He was very serious.

54:06.873 --> 54:10.797
And I think maybe that's, that's what made him do this other thing.

54:10.817 --> 54:11.058
Right.

54:11.758 --> 54:11.859
Yeah.

54:11.879 --> 54:18.366
But in any case, um, we had, uh, we had a group, a motley crew in Delano.

54:18.386 --> 54:20.409
Uh, Roy Valdez was another one.

54:20.429 --> 54:24.013
Uh, no relation, you know, who was like a man child.

54:25.158 --> 54:27.422
And, uh, he died tragically.

54:27.442 --> 54:37.498
Uh, but yeah, I won't go into that detail, but the thing is that, um, our comings and goings, actually Roy was from Houston.

54:38.700 --> 54:44.590
And, uh, so we all used to pack into a little station wagon and go cross country, right?

54:44.710 --> 54:45.271
In those days.

54:45.572 --> 54:47.715
Uh, and Roy took up a lot of space.

54:47.735 --> 54:48.476
He was a big guy.

54:49.999 --> 54:50.119
Um,

54:51.297 --> 54:52.759
And he was funny on the stage.

54:52.779 --> 54:53.921
He was a real presence.

54:53.941 --> 55:03.796
He was almost Taliban like, you know, but, uh, unpredictable and with a temp, with a temper that was uncontrollable.

55:03.816 --> 55:08.162
Sometimes you get into a fight, you know, with the guys and it was hard for me to control it.

55:08.683 --> 55:10.646
Uh, two of them got into it.

55:10.666 --> 55:11.727
These are grown men, right?

55:12.348 --> 55:12.448
Yeah.

55:12.468 --> 55:15.613
I mean, I had to step in and say, cut it guys, cool it, you know?

55:16.054 --> 55:18.317
Uh, and, and, uh,

55:19.698 --> 55:25.323
The teatro was like, at that time, you talk the early teatro, it was like a real volatile mix.

55:25.884 --> 55:35.292
And of those really, Danny and Felipe and Augie, you know, were the core, I would say.

55:35.572 --> 55:40.557
And that moved to Del Rey.

55:40.777 --> 55:44.560
You know, when we moved to Del Rey and that grew a little bit, we had a few more people.

55:45.301 --> 55:48.844
Until the end of 68, when I dissolved that whole group, I said,

55:50.815 --> 56:04.271
It was too volatile, you know, they, they, they were doing, the guys were having late night parties, you know, I mean, we, we tried to keep a, a discipline, um, schedule going.

56:04.291 --> 56:12.621
We're all living in one house, old farmhouse after Delano, we all moved into a farmhouse outside of Delray and we had a schedule.

56:13.542 --> 56:14.744
We're eating communally.

56:15.064 --> 56:18.949
We're sharing kitchen duties and, uh,

56:19.621 --> 56:21.443
that worked all right for about a month.

56:21.503 --> 56:23.906
And then it began to fall apart, you know, lack of discipline.

56:25.147 --> 56:29.112
And, uh, it was becoming like bachelor pad or something.

56:29.132 --> 56:34.278
It became a real bachelor pad and Danny would be in the living room singing at the top of his voice.

56:34.358 --> 56:37.361
And I'm right in the next room over trying to get some sleep.

56:37.442 --> 56:38.082
Right.

56:38.963 --> 56:46.472
And then in the morning he wouldn't get up, you know, he wouldn't wake up because we had to start getting everybody up to seven 30 in the morning to take showers and, you know, be,

56:47.279 --> 56:55.894
Our aim was to get to the office by nine, but we wouldn't, it started at 9.30, 10, you know, eventually people weren't rolling in until noon.

56:55.994 --> 57:01.844
So it got, it got really... That's Mexican time, right?

57:02.705 --> 57:10.879
Well, and then it went on late, you know, I mean, we'd work until 10 o'clock and then I'd go home, but then it turned out they were having parties after that.

57:10.899 --> 57:12.662
And, uh, I didn't know about that.

57:13.790 --> 57:15.192
So I got fed up with it.

57:15.332 --> 57:27.890
You know, we did some great work, some interesting work in 1968, but by the end of the year, and it was a ruckus year anyway, two assassinations, you know, on the national level, the war in Vietnam was still raging.

57:27.970 --> 57:33.278
I mean, it was, it was a nervous breakdown time really for everybody.

57:33.599 --> 57:37.825
And so at the end of 68, I said, I can't go on this way.

57:37.865 --> 57:39.287
I want to do something different.

57:39.307 --> 57:40.168
And so I said, um,

57:40.621 --> 57:41.522
I'm moving on.

57:41.542 --> 57:43.084
You guys can go wherever you want.

57:43.565 --> 57:46.028
I'm taking the teatro to another level.

57:46.088 --> 57:46.969
So we moved to Fresno.

57:47.590 --> 58:02.569
And that's when Phil Esparza joined, you know, your father, you know, also Felix came in as a student volunteer, you know, coming out of Fresno State because I started teaching at Fresno State.

58:02.589 --> 58:07.575
And then the class that I taught brought in people.

58:07.876 --> 58:08.557
Lupe joined.

58:08.577 --> 58:09.598
She was one of my students.

58:09.697 --> 58:13.722
And she graduated and started dropping into the Teatro in Del Rey.

58:13.762 --> 58:16.465
So she became more and more of a regular member.

58:17.446 --> 58:23.394
And so she joined in 68 until we broke the Teatro up at Del Rey and moved to Fresno.

58:23.414 --> 58:25.716
And then she rejoined in Fresno.

58:25.737 --> 58:27.098
And that's how we got together, right?

58:27.118 --> 58:34.007
We became a couple on the trip to, our first trip to, to France.

58:34.968 --> 58:38.472
The Teatro had really sort of dissolved and I was trying to bring it together again.

58:39.278 --> 58:45.988
And we got this invitation to come to the Nancy World Theater Festival in Nancy, France in the spring of 69.

58:46.388 --> 58:54.500
And that became a catalyst and I was able to recruit more people to come back into the theater because we were going to France, right?

58:54.520 --> 58:59.607
So the theater was reborn, basically because we had this new opportunity.

58:59.868 --> 59:04.715
We would have been reborn anyway, but I mean, this gave, made it quicker, made it faster, make it focused.

59:04.735 --> 59:08.340
We had to rebuild our repertory up again, get the songs going.

59:08.658 --> 59:18.532
get the old actos together because we're going to perform actos and the shrunken head of Panchoia at my first play at Nancy.

59:18.552 --> 59:27.666
And so there are other minor chapters, you know, to this story, but I won't go into them.

59:29.689 --> 59:30.470
All right.

59:31.792 --> 59:35.998
Let me see if there's anything else that I'm not talking about about it.

59:36.299 --> 59:40.406
Oh, one more kind of question, I think.

59:41.087 --> 59:47.538
When you were at San Jose State, was, is his name Jorge Clor de Alba?

59:47.979 --> 59:48.159
Yeah.

59:48.940 --> 59:54.490
Did you work, was he there when you were a student there or was that afterwards?

59:54.570 --> 59:55.131
I don't remember.

59:55.151 --> 59:55.992
It was afterwards.

59:56.233 --> 59:57.054
It was afterwards.

59:57.074 --> 59:57.775
Oh, okay, okay.

59:58.256 --> 01:00:01.041
Because I was just, I was curious, like,

01:00:02.067 --> 01:00:26.539
What was it about being at San Jose State that really kind of, because they said this is about, you know, when you first get to San Jose State is when you start writing this column, is when you start learning about, you decide, I'm going to identify as Mexican, is when you start reading more about the Mexican Revolution and Mexican history.

01:00:27.025 --> 01:00:29.569
And, um, Vasconcelos.

01:00:30.731 --> 01:00:34.096
Uh, so I was just wondering, was there somebody at San Jose State?

01:00:34.177 --> 01:00:43.191
Was there a friend, um, a professor, somebody that, or was it just kind of like, you know.

01:00:43.211 --> 01:00:43.912
Spontaneous.

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:46.857
Spontaneous or yeah.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.525
There were no mentors as such, you know, there were no kind of mentors.

01:00:51.685 --> 01:00:52.006
Okay.

01:00:52.046 --> 01:00:52.707
That's what I'm saying.

01:00:52.727 --> 01:00:53.488
There was nothing there.

01:00:53.924 --> 01:01:00.331
Uh, in an odd kind of way, the circumstances, uh, provided me with an opportunity I wouldn't have had.

01:01:01.312 --> 01:01:04.315
Like I say, I was a farm worker until I was 18.

01:01:05.937 --> 01:01:11.282
And I was in, uh, I was at San Jose State the last time that I worked in the fields.

01:01:11.423 --> 01:01:13.685
I was already like a math and physics major.

01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:14.786
Right.

01:01:14.806 --> 01:01:15.447
Cutting broccoli.

01:01:15.567 --> 01:01:22.294
You know, I use that line in ballet of the heart, you know, what am I doing cutting broccoli, uh, on the weekends, which

01:01:23.253 --> 01:01:25.635
I decided that I needed to do something else.

01:01:25.655 --> 01:01:27.477
So I went around looking for a different job.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:31.802
And eventually I got a job at the library.

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:36.206
1960 actually was beginning of 60 or late 59.

01:01:36.366 --> 01:01:40.731
I got a job as a stacker.

01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:41.372
That's all.

01:01:41.392 --> 01:01:47.958
You'd collect the books that had been returned, put them on a cart, take them up into the stacks and put them back in their place.

01:01:48.759 --> 01:01:51.522
But that gave me an opportunity to wander all over

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:52.716
the library.

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:56.759
And so I went into the stacks and I discovered Mexican literature.

01:01:56.819 --> 01:02:03.045
I discovered drama, you know, stuff that I would never have found, you know, on my own.

01:02:03.365 --> 01:02:09.831
It was because I was working there and I could also find books that were coming in that were new.

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.614
And so I discovered Bertolt Brecht in a new book.

01:02:12.654 --> 01:02:16.478
Martin Eslund's book came in, the biography of Bertolt Brecht.

01:02:17.178 --> 01:02:19.180
And it was a brand new book, Little Red Book.

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:21.124
And I said, I got to read this.

01:02:21.144 --> 01:02:22.466
So I was one of the first to read it.

01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:23.887
So as it arrived, I have it there.

01:02:24.768 --> 01:02:30.494
Same way I've discovered, well, Mexican literature.

01:02:31.035 --> 01:02:33.318
You know, Jose Vasconcelos, La Raza Cosmica.

01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:41.106
I discovered the Mexican novelist.

01:02:41.867 --> 01:02:43.769
Jesus, what's his name?

01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:45.251
Anyway, I met him later.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:47.513
But the thing is that, that,

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:58.070
It was in these forays into the stacks that I discovered books that became part of my intellectual formation.

01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:00.634
I was aware of what was going on in the civil rights movement.

01:03:00.654 --> 01:03:04.599
I was attending marches and demonstrations in and around the Bay area.

01:03:06.963 --> 01:03:12.511
The Vietnam war hadn't really gelled just yet, but I was in one of the very first meetings that I went to.

01:03:13.512 --> 01:03:17.398
I remember someone put up a map and said, this is Indochina.

01:03:17.986 --> 01:03:20.228
And they said, it's the site of America's next war.

01:03:20.849 --> 01:03:21.930
We hadn't even gone in there yet.

01:03:22.371 --> 01:03:23.532
We were helping out the French.

01:03:23.572 --> 01:03:32.822
I remember the French, I was in high school when Dien Bien Phu fell and the teacher had us all bow our heads for the French, the poor French that had been overrun by the Viet Minh.

01:03:33.462 --> 01:03:37.126
And so I had no understanding in high school that this was a liberation movement.

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:44.134
By the time I got to college, it became pretty apparent these people were just fighting for their own liberation, their own nationality.

01:03:45.215 --> 01:03:45.495
Yeah.

01:03:46.336 --> 01:03:50.162
So I got in on the anti-Vietnam War movement pretty early on.

01:03:50.443 --> 01:04:04.765
And, and, um, those are elements that were already part of me, but then I was also studying the American theater and, uh, well, Carlos Fuentes is the Mexican novelist I was trying to remember, who became a friend of mine later.

01:04:05.266 --> 01:04:12.057
Uh, but I read one of his first novels, uh, in English translation.

01:04:12.931 --> 01:04:17.696
Uh, but it was about Mexico city, which was a new experience for me.

01:04:17.716 --> 01:04:20.698
And again, one of the formative things that began to form my thoughts.

01:04:20.758 --> 01:04:21.839
Right.

01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:36.293
Uh, but by the same token, I mean, it, it, it, I became aware then of black people that I had never heard of in high school through my friend, uh, Frank Chichorca who went to Mississippi summer in the summer of 64.

01:04:37.454 --> 01:04:41.318
He brought back, he created a comic book of black leaders.

01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:46.777
Harriet Tubman, you know, Frederick Douglass, uh, I mean, all the leaders, right?

01:04:46.797 --> 01:04:47.577
Marcus Garvey.

01:04:48.598 --> 01:04:48.699
Yeah.

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:59.570
Uh, people I had no, no, no chance of learning any about anywhere else, but he had this comic book that he had put together and I saw these figures and they were very heroically drawn.

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:02.333
And I said, this is, this is something else.

01:05:02.353 --> 01:05:03.394
This is beautiful.

01:05:03.414 --> 01:05:09.921
So in the stacks, I began to look then for black history, trying to find

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.463
that vein, it wasn't really obvious then.

01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:16.766
It was kind of hidden because it wasn't the time yet.

01:05:18.028 --> 01:05:20.570
There weren't African-American studies yet.

01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:22.933
The people weren't putting that kind of stuff together.

01:05:23.513 --> 01:05:26.756
But I became aware that there was this whole thing that was happening.

01:05:26.797 --> 01:05:32.502
Crispus Attucks, the first guy killed in the American Revolution was a black man on the streets of Boston.

01:05:33.143 --> 01:05:34.865
And I said, wow, there's a lot of history here.

01:05:34.885 --> 01:05:36.246
I've never been taught.

01:05:36.226 --> 01:05:38.711
How much of this is also true of the Mexicans?

01:05:38.811 --> 01:05:41.336
How much of our history has not been taught?

01:05:41.356 --> 01:05:47.447
So then I ran into, in 59, it was republished, North from Mexico, Carrie McWilliams.

01:05:47.467 --> 01:05:50.493
Not knowing I was going to meet Carrie also, you know, in due time.

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:55.382
But North from Mexico turned out to be...

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:58.448
a big awakening for me in 1959.

01:05:58.649 --> 01:06:01.092
It awakened my Chicano consciousness.

01:06:02.173 --> 01:06:11.325
And so even though I couldn't find living, breathing people in my life at that time, they could teach me these things.

01:06:11.785 --> 01:06:12.787
I found them in books.

01:06:12.947 --> 01:06:14.609
I found them in literature.

01:06:14.629 --> 01:06:19.255
I found them in the general life experience, you know, of the civil rights movement.

01:06:21.498 --> 01:06:21.618
Right.

01:06:21.638 --> 01:06:22.399
Interesting.

01:06:22.936 --> 01:06:30.166
Okay, let me think, think, think if there's anything I was going to ask about that.

01:06:35.093 --> 01:06:52.318
Well, Lupe had mentioned one of the co-authors, no, sorry, an author of one of those books, Domingo Martinez Paredes.

01:06:52.754 --> 01:06:53.996
Domingo Martinez Paredes, yeah.

01:06:54.417 --> 01:06:55.018
Yeah.

01:06:55.038 --> 01:07:10.162
Had you, um, so prior to like, I don't know, like during that time period as well, the early sixties to 63, 64, had you come across his work or was that something later?

01:07:10.703 --> 01:07:11.604
No, not at all.

01:07:11.624 --> 01:07:14.649
I don't think that he was even publishing at that time.

01:07:14.669 --> 01:07:14.929
Okay.

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:20.398
It, uh, his publications came in the late sixties, but, uh,

01:07:20.648 --> 01:07:24.052
And there was a very special way that we connected eventually.

01:07:24.493 --> 01:07:25.654
It had to be through the teatro.

01:07:25.794 --> 01:07:28.578
It was through the teatro that that experience.

01:07:28.598 --> 01:07:29.959
I don't know if you want to talk about that now.

01:07:29.999 --> 01:07:33.323
You just want to deal in the 60s, what I was learning.

01:07:34.124 --> 01:07:42.374
Yeah, no, I was just curious if that was something that was also like, was that something that you found in the stacks?

01:07:42.494 --> 01:07:46.519
You know, like you were talking about, I started to read Los Concelos.

01:07:46.539 --> 01:07:48.782
I started to look at Mexican literature.

01:07:49.387 --> 01:07:54.253
No, I did not find I did not find Martinez Paredes in the stack.

01:07:55.134 --> 01:07:55.774
He wouldn't have been there.

01:07:56.175 --> 01:08:08.850
There was no way that anybody was going to pick up those books, you know, and as it is, they were published in paperback in Mexico, he published, you know, through his sources in Mexico.

01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:12.694
And we're very fortunate to have copies of his

01:08:13.838 --> 01:08:39.863
his work you know uh but the thing is that uh he gave them to me he gave me his books he actually gave me permission to translate his books into english i found it kind of tough going yeah for various reasons his style was kind of non-stop the kind of way i talk like a stream of consciousness yeah uh but we did incorporate the ideas you know i mean i went through his books like

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:44.800
like a gold miner going through finding nuggets for gold, right?

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:45.802
Yeah, everywhere.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:47.484
Everything's underlined and highlighted.

01:08:47.504 --> 01:08:49.387
And then pulling them out and saying, I can use this.

01:08:49.447 --> 01:08:51.010
I can incorporate this into the work.

01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:53.353
This explains why this is so and why that's so.

01:08:53.994 --> 01:08:54.094
Yeah.

01:08:54.114 --> 01:08:56.257
And so it was like a revelation to me.

01:08:56.437 --> 01:08:59.141
It was really, truly a revelation.

01:08:59.161 --> 01:09:05.771
But I'll tell you what happened is that in 1970, we had our first, well, 69, we went to Nancy.

01:09:05.971 --> 01:09:07.774
It gave me the idea of a festival.

01:09:08.176 --> 01:09:11.660
By 70, we set up our own Chicano Theater Festival in Fresno.

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:20.430
This was in the spring, just a few months later, in the spring of 70.

01:09:21.151 --> 01:09:24.715
It so happened it was the day of Kent State, you know, when they murdered the students.

01:09:24.755 --> 01:09:26.257
Well, it was the week of Kent State.

01:09:26.878 --> 01:09:30.622
And Reagan closed all the state colleges because there were going to be demonstrations.

01:09:31.343 --> 01:09:35.888
And that was the weekend that we had planned to have our...

01:09:37.032 --> 01:09:40.537
first Chicano theater festival in Fresno.

01:09:40.557 --> 01:09:43.641
Uh, I was co-chairman of the La Raza studies.

01:09:44.362 --> 01:09:50.010
So we had access to some academic funds and we used those funds.

01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:51.873
I was co-chairman with Eliezer Risco.

01:09:51.893 --> 01:10:00.905
I mentioned him and, uh, I've been offered the chairmanship of the whole department, but that would have meant sacrificing the teatro and I didn't want to do that.

01:10:00.925 --> 01:10:06.313
So Risco came in as the academic, even though he wasn't an academic.

01:10:07.289 --> 01:10:11.893
How do you spell Risco?

01:10:12.013 --> 01:10:12.334
R-I-S-C-O.

01:10:12.574 --> 01:10:13.034
Eliezer.

01:10:14.556 --> 01:10:16.717
E-L-I-E-Z-E-R.

01:10:18.499 --> 01:10:18.960
Eliezer.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:24.424
He died a couple of years ago, last year in Fresno.

01:10:25.946 --> 01:10:35.434
But in any case, we drummed up some money, and it was that money that we used to invite the mascarones.

01:10:36.355 --> 01:10:37.296
I literally sent...

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:43.657
We sent $500 in an envelope to Mariano.

01:10:43.677 --> 01:10:44.879
I hadn't met Mariano yet.

01:10:45.540 --> 01:11:01.680
What happened is that when we were in France at Nancy, the wife of Enrique Buenaventura, a Colombian playwright, who was French, Jacqueline something, came to see the teatro and she says, you know, I love your work.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.283
She said, you remind me very much of Los Mascarones in Mexico.

01:11:04.323 --> 01:11:05.224
And I said, who's that?

01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:07.352
They say, oh, it's an activist group.

01:11:07.372 --> 01:11:08.212
You should know about them.

01:11:09.194 --> 01:11:11.496
And so that stuck, Los Mascarones, right?

01:11:11.516 --> 01:11:16.221
So when we came back and started organizing our festival, we had a conversation.

01:11:16.241 --> 01:11:19.825
I said, you know, we need, it'd be good to have some international presence here.

01:11:19.845 --> 01:11:21.227
And we're not a Mexican troupe.

01:11:21.307 --> 01:11:21.847
That'd be great.

01:11:22.408 --> 01:11:24.931
I've heard about these guys, Los Mascarones, maybe they'll come.

01:11:24.951 --> 01:11:27.253
So we drummed up 500 bucks.

01:11:27.594 --> 01:11:29.456
I didn't know if that was enough.

01:11:29.476 --> 01:11:30.457
It turns out it was.

01:11:30.737 --> 01:11:33.540
And so we invited Mariano.

01:11:33.892 --> 01:11:38.677
And four of them came, Mariano, Lourdes, Perez Guy, and a couple of others.

01:11:39.277 --> 01:11:40.459
Fantasma was another one.

01:11:41.319 --> 01:11:45.163
And, and they came and performed at our first festival.

01:11:47.325 --> 01:11:49.548
Uh, and they blew us all away.

01:11:49.568 --> 01:11:50.368
They blew me away.

01:11:50.589 --> 01:11:56.835
I just, because this was like Mexico and there was of course in speaking in Spanish and they had choral poetry.

01:11:56.855 --> 01:12:00.118
They were very serious, deadly serious in terms of the work.

01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:02.972
So this was the fall.

01:12:03.092 --> 01:12:04.354
This is the spring of 70.

01:12:05.016 --> 01:12:07.660
So we invited them back in the fall, come back in the fall.

01:12:08.522 --> 01:12:18.218
And they came back and they brought Andres Segura, you know, Granados, the maestro de danza, capitán de danza.

01:12:18.238 --> 01:12:23.187
Only him with his feathers and his mandolina and la concha.

01:12:23.926 --> 01:12:33.078
And it was, again, another revelation to see that, to see someone in full feathers, you know, oh God, Fresno.

01:12:33.158 --> 01:12:44.113
I mean saying, God, that just shattered all of these misgivings that I'd had about our Mexican identity since I was a kid.

01:12:44.173 --> 01:12:49.039
Suddenly I'm seeing this guy, this warrior in all these feathers, Danzante.

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.082
And it just shattered all of that.

01:12:51.122 --> 01:12:53.126
It changed the whole perspective, right?

01:12:53.146 --> 01:12:57.113
And of course, the danzante tradition is now really dug in all over, right?

01:12:57.133 --> 01:12:57.233
Yeah.

01:12:57.253 --> 01:13:04.986
But that's because, one is Andres Segura, and the other is Francisco Yescas, who was another one who was in LA at the time.

01:13:06.869 --> 01:13:13.761
Trying to go more commercial, quite frankly, but they both had an impact, you know, on the formation of grupos de danza.

01:13:14.483 --> 01:13:25.323
And again, I have my own complicated relationship with Andres Segura, but there's no question that he was the maestro brought by the mascarones.

01:13:25.343 --> 01:13:33.859
And in 72, when we all went to Mexico City, including your dad, we met

01:13:33.923 --> 01:13:38.770
Andres Segura introduced us to Martinez Paredes, Domingo Martinez Paredes.

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:43.757
We went to his house and I was quite taken with him.

01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:44.919
I love the old man.

01:13:44.979 --> 01:13:46.682
He's a short little Mayan.

01:13:47.303 --> 01:13:53.812
And he was duly impressed that we were interested and that we were from the United States.

01:13:55.174 --> 01:13:56.757
So man, he showered us.

01:13:56.777 --> 01:13:58.740
He gave me his books and showered me with his books.

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:02.445
And so for the next 12 years,

01:14:03.269 --> 01:14:04.831
to 84, I think he died in 84.

01:14:05.632 --> 01:14:09.157
We, uh, we had a correspondence, you know, we saw him again.

01:14:09.698 --> 01:14:10.800
We went back to Mexico.

01:14:11.961 --> 01:14:18.411
He wasn't, uh, he was in dire straits, you know, he, he was poor, very, very poor.

01:14:19.472 --> 01:14:26.522
He, he existed by writing letters for people that were too illiterate to write their own letters.

01:14:26.542 --> 01:14:32.010
He had been a professor at the UNAM, but they drummed him up because he was so critical of

01:14:32.581 --> 01:14:37.867
American and British scholars that were coming to put experts on the Mayans.

01:14:37.887 --> 01:14:39.208
And he was a Maya Yucateco.

01:14:39.288 --> 01:14:40.269
He spoke the language.

01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:42.732
He said, these guys don't know what they're talking about.

01:14:44.194 --> 01:14:53.664
And, uh, so they drummed him out politically, but his, his ideas I think were absolutely unique, really tremendous, you know, certainly an eye opener for me.

01:14:54.845 --> 01:14:57.188
And, uh, I'm only sorry I wasn't able to help him.

01:14:58.771 --> 01:15:02.196
uh, before he died, you know, I mean, it would have helped him financially.

01:15:02.216 --> 01:15:10.188
We tried to get some monies to him, you know, bring him here again, you know, I would have loved to have brought him here, but none of that was possible.

01:15:10.228 --> 01:15:17.039
You know, we were locked into our time, but nevertheless, his ideas remain and they've impacted on my work.

01:15:17.059 --> 01:15:24.590
And, and I can see how the whole Densante movement and really the Indigenista aspect of the Chicano movement is still very much alive.

01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:25.251
It's still,

01:15:26.092 --> 01:15:33.079
very present and even more insistent, you know, on exposing the ideas and concepts that go with it.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:38.044
I just spoke at the Miami East conference in Texas, right?

01:15:38.104 --> 01:15:38.945
No, in Arizona.

01:15:40.427 --> 01:15:48.595
And that they brought in scholars from Yucatan to come in and discuss Mayan culture.

01:15:49.276 --> 01:15:53.500
And so there are tremendous links that are happening.

01:15:54.391 --> 01:15:56.977
Uh, the political situation really isn't much better.

01:15:58.521 --> 01:16:02.490
Uh, but those ideas are there, they're alive and present.

01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:04.875
And, uh, that's how we connected through it.

01:16:04.895 --> 01:16:11.911
You know, it's through the teatro, the connection of the mascarones to directly Martinez Paredes, Domingo Martinez Paredes.

01:16:11.931 --> 01:16:12.653
Interesting.

01:16:13.122 --> 01:16:17.366
Okay, and one more question in this area.

01:16:18.727 --> 01:16:41.509
And that was about, or maybe it's just a clarifying question, but you had talked about when you were kind of, you know, having this convergence of teatro and activism kind of ideas, went in 63, 64, around there.

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:44.067
Before going to the UFW, right?

01:16:44.087 --> 01:16:45.249
Before going to Delano.

01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:52.780
And you had said that you were influenced by the Jewish tradition.

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:54.963
And the Irish, you know.

01:16:55.264 --> 01:16:56.125
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:56.225 --> 01:16:57.327
And the Irish, too.

01:16:58.128 --> 01:16:59.130
And the African-Americans.

01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:01.553
You know, these are all different influences, right?

01:17:01.574 --> 01:17:02.855
Right.

01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:10.467
And so I guess what I'm trying to find out more about that is

01:17:11.864 --> 01:17:28.522
Like, was that teatro art, was that the way that you saw, hey, this is the best way I can express how I feel about what's going on, how I can be active, how I can be a participant in this broader movement?

01:17:28.582 --> 01:17:30.767
So not necessarily Chicano movement, but

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:44.879
the anti-war movement, the kind of like third world liberation movement that's going on in the 50s and early 60s up until you get to Delano.

01:17:44.899 --> 01:17:46.762
Is that kind of inaccurate?

01:17:47.423 --> 01:17:48.064
What's the question?

01:17:48.084 --> 01:17:58.999
The question is, did you see, like, were you really kind of like more focused on the teatro and art

01:17:59.418 --> 01:18:03.384
as being your contribution to those movements.

01:18:03.985 --> 01:18:05.307
Yeah, well, I was hooked on the theater.

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.992
There's no question that that's what I wanted to do and I've always wanted to do.

01:18:10.534 --> 01:18:14.860
In my adult life, I focused on the idea of becoming a playwright.

01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:18.966
I had no idea what that would mean in terms of earning a livelihood.

01:18:20.148 --> 01:18:22.912
As it's turned out, it's been a way of life for me.

01:18:22.952 --> 01:18:23.673
It's been a career.

01:18:24.054 --> 01:18:26.337
I have been able to earn a living as a playwright.

01:18:27.262 --> 01:18:32.228
Uh, so my dreams have been realized as far as that's concerned.

01:18:32.248 --> 01:18:36.874
What it did not mean for me necessarily was the idea of going to Broadway.

01:18:36.894 --> 01:18:39.918
I had, I didn't really program that in my consciousness.

01:18:39.978 --> 01:18:40.980
I did go to Broadway.

01:18:42.181 --> 01:18:42.622
Yeah.

01:18:42.642 --> 01:18:55.058
Uh, and I'm thinking it was like going to the moon, you know, and we've never been back, you know, I mean, it, whether once or twice and that was it, you know, but, uh, we went to New York, uh,

01:18:55.696 --> 01:18:59.962
as a touring company and found that to be exciting, you know, and then went back.

01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:08.474
To conceive of myself as a New York playwright would require that New York City be different than it is.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:15.464
And it is changing, but I don't think there's been a tremendous reception for Mexicans, you know, in New York.

01:19:15.704 --> 01:19:17.367
There certainly wasn't then.

01:19:17.727 --> 01:19:23.155
I mean, in 79, when we were there with Zoot Suit, we were

01:19:24.772 --> 01:19:33.887
We were a cause celeb when we were there in our first tour, which was in 67.

01:19:37.013 --> 01:19:45.066
And, you know, we've made all the national newspapers, the magazines, even television, PBS.

01:19:45.086 --> 01:19:47.951
They embraced us as farm workers.

01:19:47.971 --> 01:19:49.834
That idea was not a problem.

01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:51.351
That was good.

01:19:51.691 --> 01:19:56.096
They figured, okay, that matches you guys, Mexicans and farm labor.

01:19:56.236 --> 01:19:56.476
Yeah.

01:19:56.636 --> 01:19:57.337
All right.

01:19:57.357 --> 01:19:59.960
And then Mexican farm workers theater.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.082
Oh, that's even an interesting twist, you know?

01:20:02.102 --> 01:20:05.946
So we got very good positive reviews and all the newspapers.

01:20:06.827 --> 01:20:09.710
Years later, uh, what would that be?

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.893
12 years later, we're back there with Zoot Suit.

01:20:12.914 --> 01:20:15.036
Suddenly it's quite the reverse.

01:20:15.056 --> 01:20:18.960
They're saying, no, no urban, trying to be theater at the winter garden.

01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:25.439
And so even though we got, you know, some positive reviews, for the most part, the major newspapers really slammed us.

01:20:25.459 --> 01:20:26.781
You know, they savaged us.

01:20:27.101 --> 01:20:32.449
So it's kind of like they were welcoming as long as you knew your place.

01:20:32.469 --> 01:20:33.371
Yeah, exactly.

01:20:33.531 --> 01:20:38.017
But once you try to come have a seat next to us, no, no, you can't do that.

01:20:38.037 --> 01:20:41.703
Come to the big city and come to a flagship like the Winter Garden?

01:20:42.264 --> 01:20:44.146
No, you're not ready.

01:20:44.166 --> 01:20:47.912
You know, the zoot suit threads are bare, as one newspaper said.

01:20:47.952 --> 01:20:48.593
You know, it's not.

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.441
You can't make it.

01:20:50.461 --> 01:20:59.891
So the idea of, of being a New York playwright, I think is a big challenge for a lot of Latino playwrights, including the contemporary ones, you know, still trying to break through.

01:21:01.052 --> 01:21:11.783
Uh, we got to New York, we got to Broadway really based on our success in Los Angeles, you know, which speaks to that emerging to bi-coastal reality of the Americas, right?

01:21:11.803 --> 01:21:15.747
That West coast is not East coast and East coast is not West coast.

01:21:15.767 --> 01:21:17.449
And who knows when the twain shall meet.

01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:19.132
you know, where they meet.

01:21:19.232 --> 01:21:23.340
I don't think they meet in Kansas, but maybe Chicago.

01:21:23.941 --> 01:21:30.513
But the thing is that, that it was a different reality for us to go.

01:21:31.114 --> 01:21:36.484
In any case, that didn't bother me because I had no illusions or dreams or expectations that I could

01:21:37.038 --> 01:21:39.200
exist as a playwright on the East Coast.

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:40.502
It was not a way of life.

01:21:41.143 --> 01:21:45.147
Why would I go to East Coast anymore than I would go to France or Germany to live, right?

01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:46.008
Yeah.

01:21:46.028 --> 01:21:48.191
It just seemed like alien, an alien place.

01:21:48.271 --> 01:21:57.962
And it was more important for us to really incorporate ourselves into this world on the West Coast and to make California Mexican again, you know, for us.

01:21:57.982 --> 01:21:58.642
Yeah.

01:21:58.663 --> 01:22:01.946
And also I was aware that this had been Mexico.

01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:05.290
And to that extent, also the fact that San Juan Bautista

01:22:05.557 --> 01:22:07.340
was one of the capitals of the state.

01:22:08.301 --> 01:22:17.133
And I've never liked the idea of being an unwanted visitor, an alien, you know, locked into a barrio or a ghetto, or marginalized.

01:22:18.055 --> 01:22:23.863
The idea of being in San Juan Batista gives us a continuity that's been here since the founding of the town, right?

01:22:23.883 --> 01:22:31.714
And even before, you know, with the Native Americans that lived here in a little village called Papalachum, because we're Native American too.

01:22:32.074 --> 01:22:35.479
And so that continuity is what feeds me.

01:22:36.016 --> 01:22:40.441
and what has fed my work and my perspective on the world, all my adult life.

01:22:41.262 --> 01:22:50.471
And so the idea of the teatro campesino is like a, it's like a boat out in the middle of the ocean, right?

01:22:50.552 --> 01:22:53.635
It keeps you afloat and everything else is water.

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:56.438
Otherwise you got to swim on your own, man.

01:22:56.478 --> 01:22:59.321
You're out there and there's a lot of sharks in the water too.

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:00.442
So you got to be very careful.

01:23:00.462 --> 01:23:05.027
You should have some kind of float that'll keep you above water for a while.

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:05.948
Yeah.

01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:07.911
All right.

01:23:08.112 --> 01:23:10.757
Let me move on to my next question.

01:23:13.161 --> 01:23:18.792
And this will maybe, maybe not take us down a different kind of direction.

01:23:18.912 --> 01:23:20.535
But I want to talk about

01:23:21.089 --> 01:23:36.428
How do you understand, or maybe I should say, do you know, what is your concept or understanding of mestizaje or what it means to be mestizo?

01:23:36.589 --> 01:23:41.615
What does that mean to you when you hear those words, those ideas?

01:23:41.635 --> 01:23:43.958
Mestizaje or mestizo?

01:23:45.203 --> 01:23:58.499
Well, I think it's part of a natural process in the world and I mean, in nature that first of all, genetic blending, you know, biological merging is a fact of life.

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:11.734
And even though certain species maintain their characteristics for millennia, nevertheless, there are variations within all these different species.

01:24:12.001 --> 01:24:15.346
And the human species itself has had a lot of variations over time.

01:24:15.406 --> 01:24:23.458
But we've remained remarkably consistent in terms of our humanity, who we are and what we do with our lives.

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.062
And some of these are unchanging.

01:24:26.422 --> 01:24:29.026
Like I say, you've got to look at the Eternals.

01:24:29.046 --> 01:24:29.888
We all have to eat.

01:24:29.908 --> 01:24:30.889
We all have to sleep.

01:24:30.909 --> 01:24:31.991
We all have to reproduce.

01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:35.516
We all have to, you know, defecate and all that.

01:24:35.536 --> 01:24:39.662
Those are ongoing activities that take up a substantial part of our lifetimes.

01:24:39.963 --> 01:24:48.495
And then there's the times when all those are settled and then what you do with your mind and what you do with your person is what defines you.

01:24:48.515 --> 01:24:51.239
And this is where cultural differences kind of kick in, right?

01:24:51.259 --> 01:24:55.585
The genetics and the biology are stable.

01:24:55.866 --> 01:25:00.132
And then this other thing begins to give variations and, and

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:06.625
Identity is something that concerns all of us, Chicanos and the whole world, it seems to be.

01:25:06.645 --> 01:25:09.349
Everybody's trying to define themselves and say, okay, I'm from here.

01:25:09.409 --> 01:25:10.611
This is who I am.

01:25:11.753 --> 01:25:13.215
But I think it's part of a process.

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:16.460
It's not for all time.

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:24.192
I think your identity is more of a moving fluid thing that can change very gradually.

01:25:24.212 --> 01:25:27.537
To just say that somebody is American, for instance,

01:25:28.445 --> 01:25:30.167
It's a very complicated question.

01:25:30.187 --> 01:25:31.670
What defines an American?

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:36.957
And you may give some very different views as to what an American is.

01:25:37.017 --> 01:25:40.803
The stereotype is blonde, blue-eyed, you know, Hollywood type.

01:25:40.823 --> 01:25:41.684
That's an American.

01:25:42.004 --> 01:25:43.707
And that's not true.

01:25:43.987 --> 01:25:47.052
I mean, that's shifted even within the white community.

01:25:48.013 --> 01:25:50.717
And now, I mean, it includes everybody.

01:25:50.777 --> 01:25:52.900
It includes any race, any background.

01:25:53.487 --> 01:25:56.332
As far as some people are concerned, anybody can be an American.

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:57.193
That's part of the myth.

01:25:57.213 --> 01:25:59.437
That's part of the dream, right?

01:25:59.457 --> 01:26:00.599
And I think, I love that.

01:26:00.719 --> 01:26:06.048
I think that, but the same thing goes for other nationalities that get very closely identified with race.

01:26:06.509 --> 01:26:07.590
What is a Mexican?

01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:16.024
When you finally get down to it, not all Mexicans are Mexica, meaning that they're, they're born of that Aztec tribe, right?

01:26:16.045 --> 01:26:17.126
The Mexica tribe.

01:26:18.288 --> 01:26:18.769
Uh, uh,

01:26:19.087 --> 01:26:37.445
There are Otomis, there are Yaquis, there are Tarumaras, there are different kinds of Maya, you know, from different, with different dialects, you know, Tsetzal, Chontal, all these different kinds of variations of the language.

01:26:37.465 --> 01:26:41.689
And even of the biological, I might say, details that have been shifted.

01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:47.455
So the idea of a Mexican identity is a concoction.

01:26:47.475 --> 01:26:48.756
It's a creation.

01:26:49.208 --> 01:27:04.135
that came out of the Spanish conquest of the tribes that were here, and then the imposition of a national identity called Mexico, which not all Mexicans identify with, you know, not all indígenas identify with, they understand what it is.

01:27:04.716 --> 01:27:10.727
In my case, in my background, the Yaquis fought against the Mexicans for 400 years, okay?

01:27:11.197 --> 01:27:15.462
from 1528 until 1937, they didn't even identify themselves as Mexicans.

01:27:16.043 --> 01:27:35.606
When my family and possibly yours came across the border, and probably yours, not just possibly, probably, they went from being Indians, Indios, to begin Mexicans, to being Mexicans, you know, which they weren't in Mexico.

01:27:36.027 --> 01:27:37.288
They weren't even considered Mexico.

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.783
They were Mexicans, they were Indians.

01:27:41.125 --> 01:27:49.118
And so it's a really complicated question when you start talking about identity and how that defines itself, because it's always in motion.

01:27:50.019 --> 01:28:04.322
And again, it moves slowly, but if you study your history, if you know your history and you begin to lay out the centuries, you can see how it has shifted, how it has transformed from one thing into the other.

01:28:04.505 --> 01:28:12.096
And, and the, our concept of white people today is different than it was even just a century ago, 50 years ago.

01:28:12.116 --> 01:28:15.081
And, uh, white people were the norm, you know, they were the standard.

01:28:15.101 --> 01:28:18.266
They were the, they were the human standard.

01:28:18.286 --> 01:28:24.555
Everybody else was either sub, you know, or variations of, of, of whatever.

01:28:25.261 --> 01:28:26.543
That's no longer the case.

01:28:26.783 --> 01:28:30.267
I think we are beginning to see the world with very different eyes.

01:28:30.647 --> 01:28:39.137
We see what the Chinese have done and how old Chinese civilization is and how their brilliance has manifested itself over millennia.

01:28:40.239 --> 01:28:44.143
And you could say the same thing about the Mayas and you could say the same thing about the Ormecas.

01:28:44.163 --> 01:28:52.153
That was brilliance that manifested itself when people were living in caves in Europe, right?

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:53.935
It's how, again,

01:28:54.421 --> 01:28:56.584
It's something that is still fluid.

01:28:58.086 --> 01:29:03.973
They recently made another discovery of a rock, you know, that had been worked over by human hands.

01:29:04.013 --> 01:29:11.203
The rock was 130,000 years old, you know, so that means, wait a minute, does that mean people were here 130?

01:29:12.044 --> 01:29:13.285
Where did they come from?

01:29:13.305 --> 01:29:14.527
So that's the whole question.

01:29:14.908 --> 01:29:16.349
All of that is subject to change.

01:29:16.389 --> 01:29:19.113
So our perspective on who we are continues to change.

01:29:19.834 --> 01:29:19.994
Yeah.

01:29:20.014 --> 01:29:20.715
I think...

01:29:22.433 --> 01:29:33.928
For me, what makes sense eventually is can you reduce it down to some algorithms, some principles that allow us to live at peace with each other and not really screw anybody over?

01:29:33.948 --> 01:29:40.497
And this is where notions of democracy and the notions of cultural exchange come into being.

01:29:40.517 --> 01:29:42.179
And these are really important.

01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.222
Cultural fusion, I think it's important.

01:29:46.245 --> 01:29:52.373
That you absorb what you can from others around you and become part of the mass.

01:29:52.775 --> 01:30:03.452
without becoming a blob that you be, you're still an individual, but you're able to selectively draw the positives, you know, from the people around you.

01:30:03.472 --> 01:30:13.247
So by that token, then you could say that we've all become more Asian, more African-American, more European, more indigenous.

01:30:14.071 --> 01:30:21.183
uh, than ever before that we're exchanging these values and cultural traits at an astounding rate.

01:30:21.323 --> 01:30:25.389
It's going really fast and, and faster than ever before.

01:30:26.131 --> 01:30:28.555
And so how do you define all of that?

01:30:29.456 --> 01:30:30.558
Does Mexican say it?

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:31.860
Um,

01:30:32.836 --> 01:30:34.778
Well, yeah, within certain limits.

01:30:34.798 --> 01:30:36.760
Yeah, we still know what a Mexican is, of course, you know.

01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:40.504
But how do you distinguish between a Mexican and Honduran or a Guatemalan?

01:30:41.105 --> 01:30:42.046
It gets really tricky.

01:30:42.326 --> 01:30:49.213
You go way down there, you say, well, I don't know the difference between a Maya Yucateco and a Maya Guatemalteco.

01:30:49.233 --> 01:30:50.214
You know, what's the difference?

01:30:51.135 --> 01:31:00.285
There are more differences, there are more similarities between those two groups than there are, say, between the Mexicans and the far northern area in the deserts.

01:31:00.305 --> 01:31:01.746
Yeah.

01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:06.637
or Prietos as the case may be, but they're closer to the United States.

01:31:06.677 --> 01:31:12.907
So their whole approach to reality is a lot more common with America, with the United States, right?

01:31:12.927 --> 01:31:14.069
Not America, the United States.

01:31:14.710 --> 01:31:18.696
So you've got this vast spectrum, right?

01:31:18.716 --> 01:31:28.392
And I mean, I'm working on a new piece about the Filipinos, you know, but I'm realizing we have an awful lot of similarities with the Filipinos because of

01:31:28.962 --> 01:31:32.509
the last 300, 400 years, you know, of contact.

01:31:35.694 --> 01:31:38.540
But there's still, you can still identify Filipinos and Mexicans.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:39.581
There's still differences.

01:31:39.642 --> 01:31:44.270
You can say, although there are some people, they can't tell the difference.

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:49.800
I don't know the difference between a Filipino and a Mexican, even though they're separated by the Pacific Ocean, if you know what I'm saying.

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.461
Yeah.

01:31:50.482 --> 01:31:52.405
Like, phenotypically, you're saying...

01:31:52.385 --> 01:32:02.119
It's like a Mexican or a Chicano or a Chicana going to Spain, as Lupe and I have been in Spain, and you get confused because here are the Españoles and they look like your tios and tias.

01:32:03.181 --> 01:32:09.810
Say, wait a minute, that face, that voice, that manner of speaking, that sounds like my family.

01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:11.593
So what part of me is Spanish?

01:32:11.613 --> 01:32:14.137
And then by the same token, then what part of me is European?

01:32:15.559 --> 01:32:17.802
I not only have a foothold in Europe,

01:32:18.389 --> 01:32:19.290
Europe is in me.

01:32:19.611 --> 01:32:20.652
I carry Europe.

01:32:21.453 --> 01:32:23.276
You know, that's not so strange.

01:32:23.296 --> 01:32:26.019
And then we're beginning to discover, well, we're also African, man.

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.044
We've had an awful lot of influence coming from Africa.

01:32:29.064 --> 01:32:30.626
And I'm not just talking rock and roll.

01:32:30.646 --> 01:32:31.607
We're talking genetics.

01:32:31.647 --> 01:32:32.609
We're talking culture.

01:32:33.269 --> 01:32:42.422
We're talking about immigration coming from Africa to the new world way before the Europeans got here, as people are finding out.

01:32:43.043 --> 01:32:44.385
What defines culture?

01:32:44.685 --> 01:32:46.929
What defines identity?

01:32:46.949 --> 01:32:57.925
There are elements that can be traced to this very moment, but you can also accept the fact that this will change in relative terms.

01:32:58.686 --> 01:33:05.035
It's like the weather, you know, it will continue to change and there'll be rising and falling actions.

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:09.601
In most cases, I guess what you really have to look at is what's the tendency?

01:33:09.681 --> 01:33:10.643
Que es la tendencia?

01:33:10.683 --> 01:33:12.266
You know, where is it going?

01:33:12.287 --> 01:33:12.387
Yeah.

01:33:12.407 --> 01:33:13.930
Where is it trending toward?

01:33:14.912 --> 01:33:18.720
And I think a lot of the racism that we're seeing in our time,

01:33:19.190 --> 01:33:24.996
is, uh, is there to stay in some instances, but it's also there to disappear.

01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:26.899
It will disappear in time.

01:33:26.919 --> 01:33:33.566
It, it, it's a passing of generations, you know, whether people will ever get over their genetic and racial differences.

01:33:33.646 --> 01:33:34.127
I doubt it.

01:33:34.287 --> 01:33:42.456
Frankly, I think that, you know, we're just too contrary and we love to build barriers and create tribes and we're cliquish.

01:33:42.536 --> 01:33:47.121
And so we create cliquas and, you know, inferior, superior, that's just a

01:33:47.438 --> 01:34:14.610
a mind a human mind game that goes on and on and on but can it get better generally speaking for most people probably yeah i think the curve of the world does go up it toward progress you know and i mean i'm not a fool uh there are evils in the world there's murder there's all kinds of shit we may have a massive world war you know that will destroy millions despite that i think climate crisis

01:34:14.708 --> 01:34:19.719
Well, just the planet itself will shake us all off like fleas, you know what I'm saying?

01:34:19.739 --> 01:34:21.924
You know what, you guys bug me.

01:34:21.964 --> 01:34:24.369
Yeah.

01:34:24.710 --> 01:34:30.343
Let me ask you a little bit more about that idea of cultural fusion that you were just talking about.

01:34:30.383 --> 01:34:30.523
Yeah.

01:34:30.841 --> 01:34:37.110
And do you think that that was something that you picked up from Vasconcelos?

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:40.916
Because Vasconcelos talks about that in Raza Cosmica, right?

01:34:41.757 --> 01:34:48.947
And that this idea of this fusion of these two cultures, right?

01:34:48.967 --> 01:34:51.531
These cultures, these races in Mexico.

01:34:52.513 --> 01:34:56.258
I mean, as far as I know, he doesn't really talk a lot about the Afro world.

01:34:56.862 --> 01:34:59.144
No, he wouldn't talk about the Afro.

01:34:59.484 --> 01:35:00.225
Yeah, no.

01:35:00.245 --> 01:35:00.746
He wouldn't know.

01:35:00.786 --> 01:35:01.506
He was a white man.

01:35:01.807 --> 01:35:02.607
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:02.808 --> 01:35:20.244
But, yeah, so is that something that, like, that understanding that you have when you're thinking about mestizaje and mestizo, that idea of the cultural fusion, is that something that you think maybe picked up from Vasconcelos?

01:35:20.264 --> 01:35:22.346
You know, I think we're all mestizos.

01:35:22.827 --> 01:35:23.407
Yeah.

01:35:23.427 --> 01:35:24.388
Every single human...

01:35:24.605 --> 01:35:25.847
on the planet, Ms.

01:35:25.867 --> 01:35:32.535
Diesel, some kind, you know, you picked up from your ancestors, we picked up from the people that have been here before us.

01:35:32.555 --> 01:35:38.183
And so we fuse those things into our being and we put new names on it, new tags, and say, okay, this is who I am.

01:35:39.204 --> 01:35:50.038
But I think what Vasconcelos was describing was a particular event, historical event, massive as it was, you know, in Mexico, that

01:35:50.288 --> 01:36:17.393
can be duplicated with other cultures and other peoples in other parts of the world, you know, going way back millennia, even the migration of human beings out of Africa, you know, uh, you know, they're saying 50, 60, 60, 70, 80, thousand years ago, you know, uh, produced the phenomenon, the cultural fusion, uh, you know, the Neanderthals and the Denisovans and the humans, you know, the homo sapiens,

01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:20.072
eventually had cultural and biological fusion.

01:36:20.152 --> 01:36:24.497
They're discovering that now that the Neanderthals did not completely disappear.

01:36:24.657 --> 01:36:28.621
They, they integrated, they bred in with the, with the Homo Zabians.

01:36:28.901 --> 01:36:29.562
Yeah.

01:36:29.642 --> 01:36:33.186
And some people would agree and say, well, look at those Neanderthals.

01:36:33.206 --> 01:36:34.567
You look like Neanderthals to me.

01:36:36.049 --> 01:36:44.798
Depending on who you're talking about, you know, but, but the thing is that, that, um,

01:36:45.672 --> 01:36:49.576
What it really raises the question is that we don't know everything we need to know.

01:36:49.636 --> 01:36:52.919
We don't know everything we're going to know, you know, in due time, but let's keep learning.

01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:55.101
Let's keep doing the research.

01:36:55.121 --> 01:36:56.242
Let's keep the doors open.

01:36:56.302 --> 01:36:59.265
Let's not lock it up and say, okay, this is what it is and always will be.

01:36:59.806 --> 01:37:00.166
No, sir.

01:37:00.366 --> 01:37:03.249
You know, it depends on your place in time.

01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:05.772
White people may seem to be the top of the heap right now.

01:37:05.812 --> 01:37:06.753
That wasn't always the case.

01:37:07.533 --> 01:37:11.157
That wasn't during the ice age, which is 15,000 years ago.

01:37:12.115 --> 01:37:15.019
all of Europe, all of Northern Europe was ice.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.463
All the United States, New York City was under ice.

01:37:17.503 --> 01:37:19.166
There was a blanket of glaciers.

01:37:20.147 --> 01:37:22.651
So what was culture at that time?

01:37:22.751 --> 01:37:28.840
Well, culture was to be brown, to be in the sun, to be close to the equator and to wear very little clothes.

01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:36.632
Not big, willing clothes, you know, big cloaks of animal skins and stuff, you know, which is barbaric.

01:37:36.652 --> 01:37:40.317
But to be very live and very free and open

01:37:40.651 --> 01:37:41.913
and let the air breathe.

01:37:42.073 --> 01:37:44.977
Like the Egyptians now, you wear clothes.

01:37:45.318 --> 01:37:50.625
And like the Maya, you know, you wear almost translucent clothing so that your skin can breathe.

01:37:51.166 --> 01:37:54.050
And of course, you're brown because the sun bakes you that way.

01:37:54.090 --> 01:37:55.192
That's why.

01:37:55.212 --> 01:37:56.994
Because you live in the sunbelt.

01:37:58.236 --> 01:38:03.003
But the sunbelt is also what makes you brilliant and intelligent.

01:38:03.023 --> 01:38:08.751
Now we live in a time where the opposite, you know, if you go to the northern climes, you get more intelligent people.

01:38:09.119 --> 01:38:12.102
And that's just a prejudice of our times.

01:38:12.382 --> 01:38:27.856
It evolved in the last 15,000 years, I'm sure, but when the glaciers started to withdraw, then we got cities, then we got habitations that had to be enclosed so you could have a fire and you warm up and people could survive in that way.

01:38:29.177 --> 01:38:29.898
I don't mind that.

01:38:30.018 --> 01:38:35.343
I think we have to live all over the planet and you should learn how to live all over the planet, cold as well as hot.

01:38:35.543 --> 01:38:37.945
But the fact is that

01:38:38.819 --> 01:38:47.571
It's like a scientific, maybe this is where the physicist in me is reaffirming itself, is that you have to take a long view.

01:38:47.591 --> 01:38:57.485
You have to look a long view to understand what the patterns are and to see what has happened so that you can understand much better what it is that's happening in your own time.

01:38:57.505 --> 01:39:03.974
Because your limited timeframe of one lifetime at any time is too small.

01:39:05.036 --> 01:39:08.100
You won't learn anything that way, you know, except...

01:39:08.789 --> 01:39:12.113
except very basic stuff that you need to know in terms of survival.

01:39:12.173 --> 01:39:20.042
But if you really want to understand what the whole process is about, what your humanity is about, take the long view.

01:39:20.062 --> 01:39:31.234
So for me, the study of history and particularly the study of cultural history, not the history that people write for themselves to make themselves appear more brilliant, more powerful than theirs, but the real history, right?

01:39:31.254 --> 01:39:32.176
What are the artifacts?

01:39:32.196 --> 01:39:33.497
What do we have before us?

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.225
Uh, what is the evidence of human survival?

01:39:37.245 --> 01:39:53.130
And, and I think that a lot of us that are brown people in, in the Americas are the survivors of some horrendous events, not just human genocide, but, uh, smallpox, the way it decimated millions and millions of our ancestors, right?

01:39:53.150 --> 01:39:56.235
90% of our ancestors were all survivors over here.

01:39:57.136 --> 01:39:57.236
Yeah.

01:39:57.256 --> 01:40:00.902
And, um, so what we have to contribute, um,

01:40:01.422 --> 01:40:06.432
is very, very precious because otherwise it would have been totally lost if it weren't for us.

01:40:06.452 --> 01:40:07.935
And it exists in our genes.

01:40:07.955 --> 01:40:09.659
It exists in our minds.

01:40:09.679 --> 01:40:11.903
It exists in our imaginations.

01:40:11.923 --> 01:40:17.855
And so part of the process of the arts, this is why I'm an artist, is that you draw from your subconscious.

01:40:18.196 --> 01:40:23.346
You draw almost from your genetic makeup to come up with images that

01:40:23.866 --> 01:40:27.009
seem familiar because they were there a long time ago, right?

01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:29.732
They reaffirmed themselves.

01:40:29.752 --> 01:40:32.535
And that to me is the constant search for this identity.

01:40:33.376 --> 01:40:42.006
Again, emotion, not a fixed item, not a fixed thing, but a tendency, a wave.

01:40:42.026 --> 01:40:44.288
What is the wave and where are we on the wave?

01:40:45.209 --> 01:40:47.091
Right, right.

01:40:48.533 --> 01:40:53.518
So talking about mestizaje or mestizo,

01:40:53.853 --> 01:41:16.688
um like i i get the kind of um you know we are everybody everybody is misty so in some way or another right there's no such thing as pure pure pure blood right um like that in itself that's a that's an ideology right um

01:41:17.495 --> 01:41:19.617
It's a scientific fact, actually.

01:41:19.637 --> 01:41:21.740
I think it's a scientific fact.

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:24.162
It can be reduced down to science.

01:41:24.683 --> 01:41:25.924
Oh, about the mixed web.

01:41:25.944 --> 01:41:26.485
Genetic makeup.

01:41:26.565 --> 01:41:28.247
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41:28.267 --> 01:41:31.230
Yeah, right, right, right.

01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:42.642
But so I think, like, so the picture that you're painting right now is one of kind of like a general...

01:41:43.634 --> 01:42:13.320
like what is mestizo right everybody is mestizo everybody is a mix and you're taking that long view of it right and I'm kind of curious what is your because it is something that is present in or around the Chicano community especially now but I mean this is something Vasconcelos is writing about it

01:42:13.857 --> 01:42:24.106
In the 20s, after the revolution, Corky Gonzalez is writing, you know, writing stuff about this.

01:42:24.627 --> 01:42:26.348
Yeah, we're both conquered and conqueror.

01:42:26.569 --> 01:42:26.989
Yeah.

01:42:27.009 --> 01:42:29.511
And I think you had mentioned something about it, too.

01:42:29.531 --> 01:42:30.272
And I don't know.

01:42:30.572 --> 01:42:43.324
I don't think it was in reference to any of the actos, but maybe like when you were doing, you know, the library, the library work, the books that you were reading in there.

01:42:43.743 --> 01:42:51.775
or in your, you know, when you were writing the machete column.

01:42:52.777 --> 01:43:05.737
But is there, so you talked about we're a product of the conqueror or we're the conqueror and the conqueror.

01:43:05.757 --> 01:43:07.840
Well, that's Corky Gonzalez and I'm Joaquin, right?

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.845
He says we're both the conqueror and the conquered.

01:43:11.465 --> 01:43:11.826
Mm-hmm.

01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:17.036
Because of, again, the mestizo, the mestizake.

01:43:19.299 --> 01:43:19.419
Right.

01:43:19.439 --> 01:43:23.745
And there is a contradiction there that is very, very big.

01:43:23.985 --> 01:43:28.832
It does tend to split us into different camps.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.463
Part of my solution there is to embrace it all.

01:43:36.823 --> 01:43:41.830
I should say, okay, I identify with the human race, and I want to see where it all goes.

01:43:42.434 --> 01:43:53.110
Uh, and so again, depending on what group you're studying now with Mexico and Mexico, you've got a substantial landmass, you know, three times the size of France there.

01:43:53.130 --> 01:43:55.834
And, and, uh, it's a huge area.

01:43:56.535 --> 01:44:08.273
And at the time of the ice age, there's a reason why the high cultures were in Mesoamerica, because that was one of the few places that could sustain civilized life.

01:44:09.383 --> 01:44:12.527
was down there in that branch, in that belt.

01:44:12.547 --> 01:44:22.179
And not just the Egyptian, but also the Maya and the Olmecas, you know, and you could survive because it was warm and there was food and there were animals and, and that's, it was reality.

01:44:22.199 --> 01:44:22.860
It wasn't snow.

01:44:24.622 --> 01:44:35.857
On the other hand, I mean, there are different places in the world that have dealt with those conditions in their own ways and created their own histories.

01:44:36.257 --> 01:44:36.758
China.

01:44:37.379 --> 01:44:40.282
You know, it's right there and there's Mongolia and then there's Russia and Siberia.

01:44:40.903 --> 01:44:44.407
So all that ice came down, you know, I'm sure into China at some point.

01:44:45.027 --> 01:44:49.472
And so where Chinese civilization started is a question.

01:44:49.572 --> 01:44:50.113
I don't know.

01:44:50.453 --> 01:44:51.174
I would like to know.

01:44:51.214 --> 01:44:52.716
I'm studying Asia.

01:44:52.956 --> 01:44:56.920
I'm trying to understand that whole section of the world just as a human being.

01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:58.682
I need to know more about Asians, right?

01:44:58.762 --> 01:45:06.711
I mean, the breakdown and not just the ones that went China and Japan and Korea that we know about, but also

01:45:06.927 --> 01:45:15.469
the smaller cultures, you know, particularly since supposedly as the calendar goes, humanity was there.

01:45:16.445 --> 01:45:18.328
Before we were here.

01:45:18.348 --> 01:45:18.448
Yeah.

01:45:18.468 --> 01:45:22.133
And so, and if you believe the anthropologists, we came from there.

01:45:23.114 --> 01:45:28.601
So all the native Americans eventually crossed over the Bering Strait supposedly 20,000 years ago.

01:45:28.621 --> 01:45:28.722
Yeah.

01:45:28.742 --> 01:45:34.509
And maybe even longer, you know, maybe even before that, when there was a land bridge.

01:45:34.529 --> 01:45:37.854
So that makes us deeply at some root Asian.

01:45:38.855 --> 01:45:38.955
Yeah.

01:45:38.975 --> 01:45:41.058
So how do we understand that about ourselves?

01:45:41.138 --> 01:45:42.480
How can we understand that?

01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:43.161
And.

01:45:44.288 --> 01:45:47.372
And it's just not an affinity for sushi or Chinese food.

01:45:48.374 --> 01:45:50.056
It's deeper than that.

01:45:50.296 --> 01:45:55.904
But you begin by trying to understand how they got there to begin with.

01:45:55.944 --> 01:45:57.146
How did that work out?

01:45:57.166 --> 01:46:02.633
We know more about Europe because Europe has always put such a light on itself and everybody studies Europe.

01:46:02.873 --> 01:46:03.394
Yeah.

01:46:03.678 --> 01:46:10.572
But deepest, darkest Africa is dark because no one's really studied it beyond the people that are there, you know?

01:46:10.592 --> 01:46:13.218
But if we came from there, why don't we know more about it?

01:46:13.458 --> 01:46:16.004
Why don't we know more about the ancient cultures of Africa?

01:46:16.925 --> 01:46:21.535
You know, or you see...

01:46:22.544 --> 01:46:29.154
you know, the Congresswoman is being attacked, you know, from Somalia, you know, I mean, her face, Ilan, what's your name?

01:46:29.175 --> 01:46:29.295
Omar.

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:30.016
Yeah.

01:46:30.036 --> 01:46:30.416
Omar.

01:46:30.637 --> 01:46:32.840
I mean, her face is beautiful.

01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:34.243
These are very fine features.

01:46:34.263 --> 01:46:40.232
You know, the Somali are like Ethiopians, you know, that part of Africa is...

01:46:40.516 --> 01:46:45.145
You say, well, that's not your stereotypical African, yet she's African.

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:46.167
Yeah.

01:46:46.187 --> 01:46:49.373
She's dark-skinned, but that's not the only happening there.

01:46:49.393 --> 01:46:54.783
Look at the eyes, look at the nose, look at the softness of the skin and the look and the hair.

01:46:55.344 --> 01:46:59.632
I mean, you begin, okay, there's a misty sake happening right before your very eyes, you know?

01:46:59.892 --> 01:47:00.313
Yeah.

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:07.187
And so I don't, it takes enormous ignorance to discount all of that and say, okay, I don't know who she is.

01:47:07.807 --> 01:47:14.335
But for me, what that does is it raises questions of what is their history?

01:47:14.355 --> 01:47:19.761
I want to know more about how they got to be, you know, and there's the... I just got to start the recording again.

01:47:20.101 --> 01:47:20.641
There we go.

01:47:20.661 --> 01:47:21.102
Oh, I see.

01:47:21.222 --> 01:47:22.864
It told you that, okay.

01:47:22.884 --> 01:47:25.607
It stops it and then you have to restart it.

01:47:26.067 --> 01:47:26.168
Yeah.

01:47:26.188 --> 01:47:28.410
So Ilhan Omar, I mean, is...

01:47:30.922 --> 01:47:41.600
But you look at AOC, Alejandro Castro Cortes, and you see her features, and the thin-faced women, there's some similarities.

01:47:41.881 --> 01:47:49.995
Some people wouldn't be able to tell the difference between them, and yet there's AOC, and she's supposed to be, what, Puerto Rican or whatever.

01:47:50.035 --> 01:47:56.406
But okay, what you need is a different appreciation then for what people are and where they come from and how they got their traits.

01:47:56.977 --> 01:47:59.680
That requires a more global understanding.

01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:18.723
I think that the more we understand about the world, the way we're understanding how the weather's connected, that the wind is blowing around the whole planet and that our weather is related to the weather at the other side of the planet, so too our genetic history, our makeup, and what we do is related to what's happening at the other side of the planet.

01:48:18.743 --> 01:48:20.385
And it's important for us to know.

01:48:20.888 --> 01:48:29.037
what people eat, what they sleep, how they dream, all of that is related to the way I sleep, the way I dream, you know?

01:48:29.057 --> 01:48:41.029
And, uh, but in order to be able to get there, people have to jump over tremendous barriers that are put there to ignorance and racism and, uh, prejudices of different kinds, right?

01:48:41.049 --> 01:48:42.411
Fears.

01:48:42.431 --> 01:48:50.119
And so, uh, I would say that, uh, you either embrace the whole human race or, or you don't, and if you don't, then

01:48:50.588 --> 01:48:51.850
You wouldn't understand who you are.

01:48:52.031 --> 01:48:52.632
There's no way.

01:48:52.672 --> 01:48:53.974
You've got to embrace the whole human race.

01:48:54.295 --> 01:48:54.896
It's all you.

01:48:55.477 --> 01:48:56.318
It's all us.

01:48:58.001 --> 01:48:59.584
Yeah.

01:49:00.887 --> 01:49:12.508
To go back to the Mesisahes stuff, as you were reading, because I don't think I need to ask you, like, oh, where do you think you learned about this?

01:49:12.548 --> 01:49:14.892
I think we kind of talked about that, you know.

01:49:15.344 --> 01:49:28.527
already um but did you ever uh identify as that you know like we were talking about quirky and identify as what mestizaje or mestizo

01:49:29.249 --> 01:49:41.565
Because part of what you were talking about in terms of the Chicano movement and your activities in it was to help establish an identity, right?

01:49:42.286 --> 01:49:56.725
And so was that part of that identity, like that identity formation was part of it, including this idea of mestizo or mestizaje at that time period?

01:49:56.745 --> 01:49:58.868
So like when you were first starting to...

01:49:59.388 --> 01:50:15.926
Well, I think, I mean, the ideas of Lermachete eventually coalesced into an article I wrote for Ramparts Magazine called A Tale of La Raza that was published in 66 out of San Francisco.

01:50:16.506 --> 01:50:24.855
And there were two, one was, there was an article about Teatro Campesino as well, but Tale of La Raza was really my

01:50:25.645 --> 01:50:28.089
my philosophical underpinning, right?

01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:29.551
And they published it.

01:50:30.172 --> 01:50:39.706
And again, I was drawing from all of these ideas that I've been tapping into and exposing in the Machete papers.

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:41.949
And so I had to do something with that.

01:50:42.029 --> 01:50:44.413
And it turns out that this was an opportunity.

01:50:44.433 --> 01:50:46.215
So those ideas have not changed.

01:50:46.275 --> 01:50:54.167
I would say that I can subscribe to, unless I'm forgetting some stuff here, but I really believe that

01:50:55.548 --> 01:50:59.132
that I made a statement at that time that makes sense.

01:50:59.432 --> 01:51:08.162
And you know, I kept notebooks, I kept journals when I was in college, and there are ideas that I wrote when I was 20 years old that still make sense to me, you know?

01:51:08.382 --> 01:51:15.110
These were formative principles that I was laying down for myself, and there's been no reason for me to change them.

01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:17.132
Some of them are really way out there.

01:51:17.372 --> 01:51:24.340
They're spiritual, almost deeply philosophical, because I was a philosophy minor as well.

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:34.211
So I was trying to jot down my philosophical ideas, but eventually this was like a proclamation of my basic principles.

01:51:34.231 --> 01:51:46.645
And I think it is, well, it makes a difference what you're pinning yourself to, you know, what is it that you are subscribing to?

01:51:47.006 --> 01:51:52.572
And the big question ultimately that defines me,

01:51:54.458 --> 01:52:01.745
and anybody else really, but me, as far as I'm concerned, is what is the nature of life and death?

01:52:02.906 --> 01:52:04.327
You know, why are we here to begin with?

01:52:04.767 --> 01:52:09.892
And there's no particular answer that's gonna answer it all that's gonna satisfy that question.

01:52:11.994 --> 01:52:23.284
There's no particular race, there's no particular success of any kind, political, economic, artistic, that answers the question.

01:52:23.855 --> 01:52:24.736
Because you're still going to die.

01:52:25.637 --> 01:52:29.221
So what is the meaning of life then if we die?

01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:31.223
Where's the life force?

01:52:32.344 --> 01:52:42.195
And the only answer that I can come up with at this point is not to think of me as an individual, but part of a mass, part of the human race.

01:52:42.215 --> 01:52:44.698
The human race will go on.

01:52:44.718 --> 01:52:47.942
And it's important for the human race to go on.

01:52:48.162 --> 01:52:53.828
And within that, of course, your race, your relatives, your people, whoever they may be,

01:52:54.263 --> 01:52:55.345
You want to help them out.

01:52:56.587 --> 01:52:59.652
You want to help that to preserve and to continue.

01:53:00.533 --> 01:53:08.986
But there's no need for every one of us to go on forever as we are, because we're creatures created in time.

01:53:09.006 --> 01:53:12.492
And so again, there's the spectrum, there's the long view.

01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:21.630
And I take the long view always, when push comes to shove, I have to go to the long view because death imposes that on us.

01:53:21.650 --> 01:53:26.275
It imposes the long view on us, whether we like it or not, because it's serious.

01:53:26.315 --> 01:53:27.937
Death is serious, you know, it's forever.

01:53:28.558 --> 01:53:30.660
So then how do we deal with forever?

01:53:31.561 --> 01:53:39.190
Well, the only possibility is the longest living thing that you can hold onto, and that's your people, your race, your human, your species, the planet.

01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:41.753
If we destroy the planet, we're all screwed, you know?

01:53:42.222 --> 01:53:50.794
And so then maybe you have to look out to the stars and say, I don't know who's out there, but I hope somebody else is out there.

01:53:50.874 --> 01:54:01.329
But the fact is that, that's why if you contemplate your own life and death, it seems to me that the notion of killing somebody else becomes absurd.

01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:03.371
Why would you want to do that?

01:54:03.391 --> 01:54:05.935
Why would you want to deprive somebody of their life?

01:54:07.096 --> 01:54:09.840
when you hold on to your own so desperately.

01:54:11.282 --> 01:54:18.071
And yet it happens all the time that people do that and they block that out and they go out and start killing people.

01:54:19.152 --> 01:54:28.885
And you say, well, then we have some very diseased people among us, you know, that need to be dealt with on some level without killing them too, neutralizing them.

01:54:29.152 --> 01:54:39.211
Yeah, I think part of that, I mean, and it's what you're talking about is what worldview are you living, right?

01:54:39.592 --> 01:54:45.142
What are the principles and things that you value that you are moving through the world with, right?

01:54:45.162 --> 01:54:50.873
So if you have those values where you respect the time that you have here,

01:54:51.427 --> 01:54:54.252
you're not going to deprive that from somebody else.

01:54:55.374 --> 01:55:05.892
But if you don't respect that, if you don't have any respect for yourself, for others, for the earth, then you're going to, you're going to, you're going to do stuff like that.

01:55:05.992 --> 01:55:06.613
Right.

01:55:06.633 --> 01:55:06.733
Yeah.

01:55:06.753 --> 01:55:12.623
I think, you know, the objective reality that we all call reality, you know, is, it doesn't really exist.

01:55:12.683 --> 01:55:16.810
It exists in our minds and that what reality is,

01:55:17.093 --> 01:55:19.398
consists of is a series of algorithms.

01:55:19.618 --> 01:55:23.306
These are mathematical probabilities that continue to happen.

01:55:23.346 --> 01:55:28.035
When you have these elements in motion and they come together in a certain way, then this is probably the outcome.

01:55:28.736 --> 01:55:31.522
And again, there's no way of knowing for sure, but it's probability.

01:55:32.023 --> 01:55:33.366
It's a mathematical equation.

01:55:33.446 --> 01:55:35.490
So at the basis of it all is math.

01:55:36.044 --> 01:55:38.066
And I was a mathematics major, you see.

01:55:38.086 --> 01:55:51.021
So I go back down to this play of numbers, of digits in our life, manifests itself into the elements of our life, the things that we love and we see and we eat and taste.

01:55:52.943 --> 01:56:03.435
These are all, part of the phenomenon, the shape-shifting phenomenon of life is this play of numbers, of mathematical equations that are

01:56:04.985 --> 01:56:08.188
They're the ultimate composition of the universe.

01:56:08.609 --> 01:56:13.074
And, um, maybe that's, that's the way to explain it too.

01:56:13.114 --> 01:56:18.480
You have to go back to math major me, you know, and say, okay, this is, uh, this is why I love math.

01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:18.960
I loved it.

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:21.983
I love, I love the cert certainty of it.

01:56:22.664 --> 01:56:28.871
At the same time, I love the openness of it that you could just, the numbers, you know, that you could, the numbers go, man.

01:56:28.891 --> 01:56:32.315
They just, it's, uh, they're infinite.

01:56:32.335 --> 01:56:32.515
Yeah.

01:56:32.555 --> 01:56:33.816
They go to infinity.

01:56:33.876 --> 01:56:34.637
Exactly.

01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:44.261
I was going to ask you the essay, A Tale of La Raza, is that something that's in print somewhere?

01:56:44.561 --> 01:56:46.063
Yeah, Ramparts Magazine.

01:56:46.544 --> 01:56:47.825
Oh, Ramparts Magazine.

01:56:47.845 --> 01:56:49.227
Ramparts Magazine, 1966.

01:56:49.287 --> 01:56:53.532
So if I Google it, I can find it?

01:56:53.552 --> 01:56:53.772
Yeah.

01:56:55.194 --> 01:56:57.176
Magazine.

01:56:57.196 --> 01:57:03.223
And then what I was going to ask you about is all of these things that you discuss in this essay,

01:57:03.828 --> 01:57:13.604
And these kind of principles or values that you are discovering about yourself and about your people and this and that.

01:57:14.546 --> 01:57:16.950
Was that something you were, like, alone on?

01:57:17.290 --> 01:57:30.612
Or was it that... Because on the one hand, you're saying, look, prior to 1960, we'll say, there wasn't any...

01:57:32.363 --> 01:57:40.392
There was a lack of knowledge about our history and our identity and who we were and our place, right?

01:57:41.514 --> 01:57:48.882
And then you are starting to develop these ideas, right, of who we are, of our history.

01:57:49.303 --> 01:57:54.970
Not that you're making them up, but that you're doing the historical research.

01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:56.331
You're learning more, right?

01:57:57.793 --> 01:58:02.218
And so is this a solo journey or are you meeting people...

01:58:02.435 --> 01:58:06.059
who are like, yeah, I, I agree with that too.

01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:16.652
Or yeah, I came up with that on my own or, you know, like, was there a convergence of when you went to do the, the tour, that first tour, right.

01:58:17.693 --> 01:58:23.040
And you said that you went and you met, um, like Corky Gonzalez, right.

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:24.642
Uh, are you talking with him?

01:58:24.662 --> 01:58:28.166
And like, it turns out you guys have the same ideas.

01:58:28.226 --> 01:58:29.648
Like, do you know what I mean?

01:58:29.668 --> 01:58:29.988
Or.

01:58:30.268 --> 01:58:30.669
Yeah.

01:58:30.689 --> 01:58:30.909
Yeah.

01:58:30.969 --> 01:58:32.391
I mean, yeah, there was, uh,

01:58:35.054 --> 01:58:37.377
Yeah, coming together based on connections, right?

01:58:37.597 --> 01:58:41.401
In activism, on the one hand, the quirky was busy already.

01:58:41.662 --> 01:58:43.283
He had the Crusade for Justice going.

01:58:44.084 --> 01:58:46.627
He was a playwright too, which was really good, you know?

01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:54.576
I guess he could have become a serious playwright, but he had other things that he was doing.

01:58:54.697 --> 01:58:55.958
He'd been a boxer, you know?

01:58:56.719 --> 01:58:59.442
He was also older, a lot older than me.

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:05.152
Uh, he was more a contemporary of, of Cesar Chavez.

01:59:05.172 --> 01:59:09.839
So he was born in the late twenties, I think 28, 29, something like that.

01:59:09.959 --> 01:59:14.144
And so he was in college in the forties, which was really unusual.

01:59:15.406 --> 01:59:26.120
Even a junior college in Denver for a Chicano to be a college student and then to be a golden gloves champion with his fists.

01:59:26.761 --> 01:59:28.684
And he's an intellectual, you know?

01:59:28.704 --> 01:59:28.804
Yeah.

01:59:29.375 --> 01:59:31.619
Uh, I, all of that was admirable stuff for me.

01:59:31.739 --> 01:59:41.818
I, I, uh, I have cousins that became boxers, but, um, they weren't intellectuals, you know, so there's Corky, you know, holding his own.

01:59:41.838 --> 01:59:47.368
And so, uh, and I think we saw each other as contempos in that sense.

01:59:47.428 --> 01:59:49.692
Oh, we're sharing a lot of similar ideas here.

01:59:49.712 --> 01:59:52.497
You're doing theater and, you know, um,

01:59:54.181 --> 01:59:59.410
Again, these were different people and he was a leader in Denver.

02:00:00.633 --> 02:00:05.582
He's acknowledged more as a civil rights leader than as a writer, except for Ian Joaquin.

02:00:06.483 --> 02:00:11.733
His plays, I don't know, have not gotten a lot of play, you know, but he wrote two, I think.

02:00:12.554 --> 02:00:18.585
But we did see, they performed his play at the same time we did actos, you know, in Denver when we met.

02:00:20.911 --> 02:00:27.962
Before that, well, I had a friend also in college, Roberto Rubalcaba, you know, that was my sounding board.

02:00:29.123 --> 02:00:30.646
He became my compadre eventually.

02:00:31.647 --> 02:00:32.749
We went to Cuba together.

02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:41.281
So my political concepts found a kindred spirit in Roberto.

02:00:42.123 --> 02:00:46.950
And we started calling ourselves Chicanos, given our background.

02:00:47.371 --> 02:00:50.395
He was from Santa Ana in LA.

02:00:50.662 --> 02:00:52.645
And kind of a tough upbringing.

02:00:55.268 --> 02:01:02.618
His mother and father were divorced, essentially, and I met them both.

02:01:03.979 --> 02:01:05.762
The mother was up here with him.

02:01:05.802 --> 02:01:08.645
He came to see me the day that she died.

02:01:10.047 --> 02:01:14.593
And she was a bit of an alcoholic, I believe, you know.

02:01:15.772 --> 02:01:18.015
And I met his father too, back in Santana.

02:01:18.555 --> 02:01:21.419
Uh, and the father was a stone cold campesino.

02:01:21.439 --> 02:01:25.724
I mean, strict, not very open at all.

02:01:26.145 --> 02:01:30.290
And these traits kind of transferred into Roberto, you know, cause he was a charmer.

02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:32.693
He was a gentleman, but he could cold very quickly.

02:01:33.714 --> 02:01:34.034
Yeah.

02:01:34.054 --> 02:01:35.176
Um, Is he still alive?

02:01:35.256 --> 02:01:35.616
Oh yeah.

02:01:35.636 --> 02:01:36.818
He, he, yeah.

02:01:36.998 --> 02:01:38.400
In Santa Cruz.

02:01:39.621 --> 02:01:44.547
Cause I was trying to look up, uh, my mom had mentioned his name.

02:01:45.235 --> 02:01:49.720
She said, oh, you might want to reach out to him and see if he would be interested in doing the interview.

02:01:50.881 --> 02:01:53.424
And I couldn't find him anywhere.

02:01:54.105 --> 02:01:56.387
And she says, ask Luis.

02:01:57.549 --> 02:01:59.831
He would probably know.

02:01:59.851 --> 02:02:04.797
Well, he... It's a very complicated relationship, right?

02:02:04.897 --> 02:02:10.243
Because he... He divorced our comadre.

02:02:10.263 --> 02:02:14.247
I mean, we were comadre compadres, you know, but he was a comadre and she died of cancer.

02:02:14.834 --> 02:02:15.616
Lovely woman.

02:02:18.083 --> 02:02:24.078
But his behavior is hot and cold.

02:02:24.199 --> 02:02:29.232
When he goes cold, he goes cold with his children and everybody.

02:02:29.397 --> 02:02:32.801
It's been a very difficult relationship.

02:02:32.821 --> 02:02:35.884
I lost track the last 20 years.

02:02:36.105 --> 02:02:38.127
I haven't really had much contact with him.

02:02:38.147 --> 02:02:40.350
I heard he had prostate cancer that he was fighting.

02:02:41.431 --> 02:02:42.432
I think he's still alive.

02:02:42.472 --> 02:02:43.613
I'm pretty sure he's still alive.

02:02:44.214 --> 02:02:45.335
And that he's in Santa Cruz.

02:02:45.375 --> 02:02:46.236
That's all I can tell you.

02:02:46.256 --> 02:02:47.678
Maybe someone else can find him.

02:02:47.718 --> 02:02:51.022
He had a series of clinics going there for a while.

02:02:51.422 --> 02:02:57.970
Let me see if there's anything else.

02:02:58.709 --> 02:03:24.616
I think the last thing I want to ask you about is because when I talked to my mom and my dad about this, one of the things that they had mentioned was that this idea or concept of mestizaje and mestizo was something that was just like people knew about it.

02:03:24.716 --> 02:03:26.218
So it wasn't like it was...

02:03:26.806 --> 02:03:31.210
you know, you went into a class and you learned about, like, white privilege, right?

02:03:31.230 --> 02:03:36.896
Like, that it was something that people just kind of knew about.

02:03:37.797 --> 02:03:48.527
And one of the things that they had both kind of related it to was, like, being in the Catholic Church and seeing, like, the Vidhin, right?

02:03:49.368 --> 02:03:54.113
And my dad was telling this story about, he said, I remember...

02:03:54.734 --> 02:04:03.127
This one time I was in like catechism and I asked the nun, why is there a brown Mary and a white Mary?

02:04:04.048 --> 02:04:06.151
He said that the nun hit him, right?

02:04:06.812 --> 02:04:10.938
And that he's always associated it with that, that pain.

02:04:11.579 --> 02:04:17.248
So that he was like, he's like, well, I don't know what this like this white Indian thing is, but I don't know.

02:04:17.549 --> 02:04:19.712
I'm not into it.

02:04:21.134 --> 02:04:37.658
So I was just curious if you were familiar or do you think you had encountered it prior to you reading, you know, rebelling against your brother and wanting to be more Mexican?

02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:42.084
I knew about the Mexican Revolution from childhood.

02:04:43.226 --> 02:04:43.847
There was talk.

02:04:45.008 --> 02:04:47.472
As a matter of fact, when we used to go work in the fields...

02:04:48.363 --> 02:04:53.293
My mother had a cry and she got from her father.

02:04:53.313 --> 02:04:57.162
A Rivera, a Madero lo han matado.

02:04:57.182 --> 02:05:02.593
So you're working, you're five, six years old, you know, and your mother's saying, a Rivera, a Madero lo han matado.

02:05:04.257 --> 02:05:05.980
What the fuck does that mean?

02:05:06.161 --> 02:05:09.207
A Rivera means get up, you know, a Madero, they've killed Madero.

02:05:09.895 --> 02:05:10.796
I said, who's Madero?

02:05:12.177 --> 02:05:13.178
It's Francisco Madero.

02:05:13.799 --> 02:05:19.485
This is a rallying cry that obviously comes from 1911 when Francisco Madero was assassinated in Mexico City.

02:05:20.105 --> 02:05:29.035
It would have come through my grandfather because my grandfather, again, like a lot of grandfathers, was a participant in the Mexican revolution, pero de lejos, you know what I mean?

02:05:29.055 --> 02:05:30.216
He didn't spend too much time.

02:05:30.276 --> 02:05:32.418
He came north.

02:05:35.341 --> 02:05:39.345
But he and his brother actually were vaqueros and they did

02:05:39.983 --> 02:05:44.789
joined some troop there for a while, and then they left, you know, went north into Arizona.

02:05:45.289 --> 02:05:55.801
But the thing is that the talk of the Mexican Pancho Villa was, was very real.

02:05:56.001 --> 02:06:04.691
I, to me, he was a real person, you know, in this one time when I was a little kid, my relatives, my tios would talk about the Villistas and the Mexican revolution.

02:06:06.513 --> 02:06:07.915
In 1952,

02:06:08.367 --> 02:06:16.259
A movie came to our, my own town, Ernie Mart at the time, you know, and our, our movie theater, which was only two years old at the time.

02:06:16.279 --> 02:06:17.220
It was established in 1950.

02:06:17.441 --> 02:06:17.581
Yeah.

02:06:18.723 --> 02:06:23.871
Um, was a Quonset hut, was a big Quonset hut, you know, one of those folded, uh, corrugated tin houses.

02:06:24.952 --> 02:06:28.638
And there was no billboard to put up the poster of the next movie.

02:06:28.658 --> 02:06:31.262
So they put it on the sidewalk in front of the movie theater.

02:06:31.963 --> 02:06:33.065
So you can walk all over it.

02:06:33.345 --> 02:06:34.827
And the movie was Viva Zapata.

02:06:35.648 --> 02:06:36.670
And I'll never forget.

02:06:37.207 --> 02:06:42.852
in front of the movie theater there on the sidewalk was Marlon Brando's face, you know, I used to walk all over it.

02:06:43.333 --> 02:06:45.635
And then there's these letters, Viva Zapata.

02:06:45.695 --> 02:06:48.958
And I said, wow, I'd never heard of Zapata until 1952.

02:06:49.178 --> 02:06:51.561
And I said, I got to see this.

02:06:51.741 --> 02:06:54.163
And so I saw the movie and was blown out.

02:06:54.263 --> 02:06:58.227
I said, Zapata, I got to know more about Zapata.

02:06:58.567 --> 02:07:03.332
And so, but he, that formulated

02:07:03.818 --> 02:07:06.102
It's not a bad movie, it still holds up.

02:07:06.122 --> 02:07:12.532
It's not historically accurate, you know, but nevertheless, um, I was very impressed.

02:07:12.552 --> 02:07:19.684
And so I was 12 years old and I distinctly remember wanting to know more about Zapata and asking.

02:07:19.704 --> 02:07:22.949
No one really could give me too much information about Zapata.

02:07:23.871 --> 02:07:30.602
But we did have 16th of September celebrations in Delano and they bring out the tribuna.

02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:55.999
which was a stage on automobile tire wheels, you know, they'd put out in the middle of the street and then they'd have the musicians and the oradores, you know, the people giving the speeches up there, the red, green and white bunting, you know, again, very festive, but people up, they had a group of men and women up on the stage and these were all people that had fought in the Mexican revolution.

02:07:56.148 --> 02:07:59.152
And again, I don't know how it was, 10, 11, 9, 10.

02:07:59.672 --> 02:08:05.960
And I remember thinking, they were saying, no, mira, estos, estas gente pelearon con Pancho Villa, you know?

02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:08.283
And it was real to me because these were real, right?

02:08:08.303 --> 02:08:11.747
And as it turns out, one of my uncles had ridden with Pancho Villa, you know?

02:08:12.528 --> 02:08:18.495
And, and, and mi tío Güero, and he turned out to be one of the huelguistas in Delano in his old age.

02:08:19.256 --> 02:08:23.081
But, um, my tío Güero was from Zacatecas.

02:08:23.622 --> 02:08:25.564
So it made perfect sense that it would have been

02:08:25.983 --> 02:08:29.990
as a teenager, you know, involved in the revolution.

02:08:30.671 --> 02:08:32.735
So the revolution was not something that was far away.

02:08:32.795 --> 02:08:36.221
The revolution was something that was in my family, that was part of my history.

02:08:37.302 --> 02:08:40.869
So the idea of revolution was still alive.

02:08:40.909 --> 02:08:46.418
And I think that for a lot of Chicanos, we share that, that that was heritage that was given.

02:08:46.879 --> 02:08:51.687
So when the idea of the Cuban revolution came around, for instance, and I went to Cuba,

02:08:52.882 --> 02:08:55.185
I felt it was a reaffirmation of my past.

02:08:55.205 --> 02:08:59.452
I was experiencing another Latino revolution, right?

02:08:59.472 --> 02:09:00.874
I mean, there it is, la revolucion.

02:09:01.074 --> 02:09:02.957
It made sense to me.

02:09:02.977 --> 02:09:11.930
And la revolucion is something that I could talk about even as a little kid because it had been a reality and that all these people working in the field, some of them had been revolutionaries.

02:09:12.611 --> 02:09:15.274
So it's not so far-fetched, you know.

02:09:16.216 --> 02:09:22.585
As I have learned over the years in studying it, I've learned that

02:09:22.902 --> 02:09:27.709
The ideology and these ideas really have deep roots and they go way back.

02:09:27.849 --> 02:09:36.321
And I mean, the ideas of Ricardo and Enrique Flores Magón, the ideologues in the Mexican Revolution.

02:09:36.341 --> 02:09:40.587
They had a newspaper called Regeneracion that was published in Los Angeles in 1911.

02:09:41.809 --> 02:09:48.218
Ricardo Flores Magón died at Fort Leavenworth on a hunger strike protesting World War I. He starved to death.

02:09:49.413 --> 02:09:55.501
protesting World War I, which I found really, when I found out about that, I said, that's amazing.

02:09:55.721 --> 02:10:07.555
But not just that, it's the fact that these ideas have been carried along from generation to generation and passed on in a number of different ways.

02:10:07.575 --> 02:10:17.007
And I have since done research, like for Carlotta, Adios Mama Carlotta, in my last play,

02:10:17.071 --> 02:10:24.982
I read a book that had been published in 1905 in Spanish about Benito Juarez.

02:10:26.324 --> 02:10:27.967
And I had to, I bought it through Amazon Books.

02:10:28.407 --> 02:10:44.631
I mean, I had found it and it was a rare copy, but I bought it and I'm glad I did because I learned some incredibly important things about Benito Juarez, you know, through this book published in 1905, again, in honor of

02:10:46.366 --> 02:10:51.015
Must have been the 35th anniversary of his death at the time.

02:10:51.756 --> 02:10:52.217
So 1905.

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:53.499
And there it is.

02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:59.570
And so every time that I've gone into history to study something, I see these connections.

02:10:59.590 --> 02:11:02.135
And so I realized that my ideas came through my relatives.

02:11:02.175 --> 02:11:07.986
How much I absorbed from my tios and tias is significant because it laid the groundwork for me.

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:16.230
And I was able, again, as a young adult, to be able to take these ideas and find other sources and add to it and keep it moving and pass it on, right?

02:11:16.270 --> 02:11:17.612
Pass it on to the next generation.

02:11:17.632 --> 02:11:18.954
Keep passing it on.

02:11:18.974 --> 02:11:21.918
And again, it speaks about the continuity and the river.

02:11:22.518 --> 02:11:24.221
It's the river of human consciousness.

02:11:24.902 --> 02:11:26.123
And you've got to relate to the river.

02:11:26.203 --> 02:11:29.748
Don't think that just because where you are is where it's always been.

02:11:29.768 --> 02:11:30.289
No, no, no.

02:11:30.389 --> 02:11:31.891
The ideas keep flowing.

02:11:32.011 --> 02:11:33.493
They keep moving.

02:11:33.894 --> 02:11:36.437
And so in that sense...

02:11:36.535 --> 02:11:41.000
Uh, I'm grateful to the ideologues in my family.

02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:51.911
They didn't have much education, unfortunately, but they had experiences and they had personal histories and I related to those personal histories.

02:11:51.931 --> 02:12:06.306
The Mexican revolution was as connected to me as my grandparents and my grandfather on my father's side, uh, was in the Huelga de Cananea in 1905.

02:12:07.214 --> 02:12:14.902
Uh, in, in Northern part of Mexico, in Sonora, right across the border from Arizona.

02:12:15.844 --> 02:12:24.793
As a matter of fact, Cananea, the mine was owned by Phelps Dodge Corporation out of, out of Tucson and Phoenix.

02:12:25.975 --> 02:12:35.365
And, um, Cananea, the strike at Cananea in 1905 was the opening shot of the Mexican revolution.

02:12:36.323 --> 02:12:44.591
So my grandfather was blackballed, you know, he was a teenager, but he was blackballed for being in the strike.

02:12:45.191 --> 02:12:54.440
So he went to work for the Perros Carriles Nacionales de Mexico, you know, the National Railroad, laying crack into Nogales.

02:12:55.281 --> 02:12:58.644
And then in Nogales, he worked in the roundhouse.

02:12:58.664 --> 02:13:04.069
And it was a point of pride in my family that my grandfather could

02:13:04.319 --> 02:13:11.913
would drive the engine into the roundhouse, you know, for repairs that he could do that, that he could drive the engine, you know, that was a big deal in those days.

02:13:11.953 --> 02:13:23.715
So I was, I used to envision that saying, wow, that was wonderful.

02:13:23.755 --> 02:13:24.316
That was great.

02:13:24.516 --> 02:13:25.698
It was important.

02:13:25.718 --> 02:13:28.183
Actually, he was just a laborer, but, but, uh,

02:13:29.412 --> 02:13:31.795
But I have a picture of him and I look like him.

02:13:31.815 --> 02:13:33.457
My dad used to say, you look like my father.

02:13:33.477 --> 02:13:35.079
And I'd say, well, I do.

02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:39.926
But it turns out, yeah, I was, all my brothers and sisters looked like my grandfather.

02:13:40.526 --> 02:13:42.849
But we have his face, you know, we have his manner.

02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:43.570
I have his height.

02:13:43.911 --> 02:13:45.793
He was like me.

02:13:45.813 --> 02:13:53.323
So I not only think about his involvement in the revolution, I also think about his involvement possibly in the Yaki Easter ceremony as an actor.

02:13:54.725 --> 02:13:55.706
I don't know that for sure.

02:13:56.006 --> 02:13:57.949
I know it only instinctively.

02:13:57.969 --> 02:13:58.069
Yeah.

02:13:58.117 --> 02:14:05.929
Once I saw the Yaki Easter ceremony in 1999 in Sonora, I realized these are the roots of the teatro.

02:14:05.949 --> 02:14:10.616
I said, this is where the Teatro Camposino, genetic memory again, you know, memoria genética.

02:14:11.758 --> 02:14:16.926
I never got to see my grandfather because he died in 1924, 16 years before I was born.

02:14:16.946 --> 02:14:17.967
But the genes were there.

02:14:18.067 --> 02:14:18.929
They came in through.

02:14:18.949 --> 02:14:23.095
So in a way, the lessons came through my dad, you know, and came to me.

02:14:23.665 --> 02:14:32.184
Again, one grandfather and then other lessons from the other grandfather and grandmothers and boom, you know, it becomes something in this lifetime.

02:14:32.224 --> 02:14:32.444
Right.

02:14:33.065 --> 02:14:43.007
And so I'm just aware that there was a lot more discussion and intellectual conversation going on at that time.

02:14:43.848 --> 02:14:48.434
It's not all dark night, you know, it's all not just ignorance.

02:14:48.474 --> 02:14:55.622
There's a lot of sensibility and a lot of intellectuality that was coming from Mexico in ways that I never suspected when I was a kid.

02:14:57.404 --> 02:15:07.797
So something really interesting you said, and I think this will be my last question because I know we're over our two hour limit, but

02:15:08.097 --> 02:15:16.628
One of the things you were talking about is, you know, that even you have a connection to the Mexican Revolution.

02:15:16.648 --> 02:15:16.908
Yeah.

02:15:16.928 --> 02:15:17.168
Right.

02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:23.556
And one of the things I was mentioning about my project is that gap, right?

02:15:23.997 --> 02:15:29.183
The gap between the Mexican Revolution and the Chicano movement.

02:15:29.203 --> 02:15:33.208
And it sounds almost like what you're saying is, well, actually, there is no gap.

02:15:33.228 --> 02:15:33.749
There is no gap.

02:15:33.889 --> 02:15:34.370
Right?

02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.510
Right.

02:15:34.979 --> 02:15:39.664
Yeah, so, okay, I just want to, like, am I tripping on this stuff?

02:15:40.005 --> 02:15:51.457
No, no, and the Chicano movement, and particularly with the involvement of the teatro, okay, directly inspired by the Mexican Revolution in the 1920s.

02:15:51.617 --> 02:15:54.140
I know that for a fact because I was there.

02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:56.983
And, I mean, it was a conscious act on my part.

02:15:57.384 --> 02:16:03.130
When we set up the Centro Cambesino Cultural in Del Rey, uh,

02:16:03.447 --> 02:16:06.350
We created the first Chicano murals.

02:16:06.530 --> 02:16:14.298
Antonio Bernal, who was a member of the Teatro at the time, was also a painter.

02:16:14.338 --> 02:16:24.688
So he painted the murals on plywood, four by eight plywood sheets, which we put over the windows of this storefront.

02:16:26.290 --> 02:16:29.953
And they've been officially acknowledged as the first Chicano murals.

02:16:31.815 --> 02:16:32.796
1968.

02:16:33.468 --> 02:16:37.894
But what we were doing there is imitating the Mexican revolution.

02:16:37.914 --> 02:16:40.678
And it's the same way too, with the gritos.

02:16:40.698 --> 02:16:44.623
When I went to Delano, they used to do a few vivas.

02:16:44.643 --> 02:16:45.785
There's no question about it.

02:16:46.886 --> 02:16:50.652
But when I came in with the teatro, we pumped that up.

02:16:50.672 --> 02:16:50.912
Okay.

02:16:50.932 --> 02:16:55.358
The vivas came up and I was reaching back to

02:16:57.447 --> 02:17:07.697
the 16th September celebration I'd seen as a kid with all these Mexican revolutionaries up there on the stage shouting viva Zapata, viva Villa, viva la revolucion.

02:17:07.717 --> 02:17:10.600
And so as a little kid, I was up there, viva la revolucion.

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:25.935
So by the time I was in my twenties and came to Delano and I have a real live strike on my hands, you know, and I'm able then to maneuver myself to the place where I'm leading gritos and chants on the picket line and in the meetings.

02:17:26.793 --> 02:17:28.555
It was a very receptive atmosphere.

02:17:28.575 --> 02:17:34.804
I wasn't the only one doing it, but I found that I could do it with complete freedom, right?

02:17:34.824 --> 02:17:37.728
That people applauded it, that that's what they wanted.

02:17:37.748 --> 02:17:51.788
And so the idea then of introducing that kind of verb into the huelga became the role of the teatro, and we included corridos, okay, huelga en general, you know, which is...

02:17:51.970 --> 02:17:56.792
a song I'd heard in Cuba, which I just translated into the Mexican to the strike.

02:17:56.812 --> 02:17:56.933
Right.

02:17:57.997 --> 02:18:00.107
A lot of people got the Chicano clap.

02:18:04.424 --> 02:18:05.967
I learned it in Cuba.

02:18:05.987 --> 02:18:08.773
I picked it up in Cuba and I brought it to the Huelga meeting.

02:18:09.755 --> 02:18:11.458
Un aplauso organizado.

02:18:11.478 --> 02:18:12.801
Man, Caesar loved it.

02:18:12.821 --> 02:18:14.765
So they're still doing it, right?

02:18:14.785 --> 02:18:16.308
They don't know where it comes from.

02:18:16.328 --> 02:18:17.109
Well, it's connected.

02:18:17.130 --> 02:18:18.292
It comes to Cuba.

02:18:18.312 --> 02:18:18.733
You know?

02:18:18.753 --> 02:18:19.895
And it's not communist.

02:18:19.915 --> 02:18:21.959
It just is what it is, right?

02:18:21.979 --> 02:18:23.122
Yeah.

02:18:23.142 --> 02:18:24.865
It's part of the genetic memory.

02:18:24.925 --> 02:18:26.348
Exactly.

02:18:26.328 --> 02:18:51.627
the the roots of revolution you know are there and it the idea of revolution for mexicans is different than what it is for a lot of americans when americans think of the american revolution you think back to the times of abraham lincoln and not you know george washington and thomas jefferson you have to go back to the american revolution with lincoln of course it's a civil war but but with mexico

02:18:52.096 --> 02:18:54.039
The revolution was our grandparents.

02:18:55.081 --> 02:19:05.358
The Mexican revolution was there, you know, and it became institutionalized unfortunately in Mexico with a pre, you know, and it led to corruption.

02:19:05.498 --> 02:19:15.534
But the idea when I was a kid and growing up and into the sixties, it was a living, breathing heritage that I wanted to see live again.

02:19:16.155 --> 02:19:17.197
And it lived again.

02:19:17.217 --> 02:19:17.918
It became real.

02:19:18.185 --> 02:19:22.791
So you know how you were talking about the Chicano clap and the huelga and stuff like that?

02:19:22.811 --> 02:19:28.318
Do you think that's also, you know, this same kind of trend with the Vigen, right?

02:19:28.418 --> 02:19:32.363
They're using the Vigen as like their banner during the march.

02:19:32.723 --> 02:19:35.687
Same thing in the Mexican Revolution, right?

02:19:36.148 --> 02:19:40.213
Well, this goes all the way back to 1810 with Father Hidalgo.

02:19:40.453 --> 02:19:43.517
He's the one that picked up the image of the Vigen of Guadalupe and marched with it.

02:19:43.987 --> 02:19:46.050
So there's that connection there.

02:19:46.090 --> 02:20:01.291
It's like the, the Chicano movement, the grape strike is drawing on that, that those messages from the Mexican revolution, which is drawing on the messages from the independence.

02:20:01.311 --> 02:20:01.431
Right.

02:20:01.451 --> 02:20:07.780
And I remember as a kid again in Delano is El Dia de la Virgen, which was in December, right?

02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:12.627
December 12th, 9th through the 12th, the apparitions, little kids would come

02:20:13.231 --> 02:20:17.536
to church with their parents dressed as Juan Diego.

02:20:17.876 --> 02:20:22.802
In other words, little white calzon blanco with a manta, the tirma, with a virgen on it.

02:20:23.062 --> 02:20:24.184
And they hold it out.

02:20:25.385 --> 02:20:28.488
And I remember thinking, oh man, I want one of those.

02:20:30.471 --> 02:20:32.413
Because I love costumes already, right?

02:20:32.433 --> 02:20:37.739
But I'm saying, wow, man, I should have had one of those.

02:20:37.759 --> 02:20:42.985
But my mom, you know, again, for one reason or another, never made one for me.

02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:45.864
But I never forgot that.

02:20:45.884 --> 02:20:48.047
I was saying, you know, yeah.

02:20:48.067 --> 02:20:57.441
So when we came to San Juan and had the opportunity to do the Virgen of Guadalupe as a play, again, you reach into your memories.

02:20:57.461 --> 02:20:57.562
Yeah.

02:20:57.582 --> 02:21:03.350
And I remember that image of Juan Guillermo and I said, okay, this has definite appeal on a lot of levels.

02:21:03.370 --> 02:21:05.474
Of course, for all Mexicanos, the Virgen is very special.

02:21:06.335 --> 02:21:06.435
Yeah.

02:21:06.455 --> 02:21:08.258
For reasons they don't even understand, you know.

02:21:08.278 --> 02:21:08.398
Right.

02:21:09.357 --> 02:21:12.120
They don't even understand exactly why, but this is primordial.

02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:12.901
It is deep.

02:21:13.682 --> 02:21:21.370
But for me, it meant that this is something that can actually manifest, that can actually become visible.

02:21:21.390 --> 02:21:25.414
And the Wilhelm play then, Jorge Huerta sent me this play with four characters.

02:21:25.494 --> 02:21:26.335
It was a liturgy.

02:21:27.676 --> 02:21:27.777
Yeah.

02:21:27.797 --> 02:21:29.178
And I said, well, this is a start.

02:21:29.579 --> 02:21:35.685
So we started here at the teatro, at the Jardines with a four character play and it,

02:21:36.155 --> 02:21:38.539
it grew, it became the Virgin show.

02:21:38.639 --> 02:21:39.000
Right.

02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:44.910
And, um, but that's just tapping in again to something that's been happening for 400 years, right.

02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:51.982
With, with, uh, 500 years almost with, with the, um, with the Mexicanos.

02:21:52.362 --> 02:21:58.032
And, and then it was with a sense of shock that I realized that she's just as popular in the Philippines.

02:21:58.973 --> 02:22:00.576
I went to the cathedral in Manila.

02:22:00.944 --> 02:22:02.306
And there's the Virgen de Guadalupe.

02:22:03.227 --> 02:22:06.971
And there are all these petitioners going on their knees, like in Mexico.

02:22:07.672 --> 02:22:08.513
These are Filipinos.

02:22:09.074 --> 02:22:11.397
And they call the Virgen, the Virgen, please, Virgen.

02:22:14.301 --> 02:22:16.643
We go pray to the Virgen, please.

02:22:16.663 --> 02:22:24.353
And the thing is, I said, wow, okay, there's a lot of heritage here.

02:22:24.518 --> 02:22:25.059
Yeah.

02:22:27.161 --> 02:22:33.127
Just to kind of go back to the Mexican Revolution connection to the Chicano movement.

02:22:33.588 --> 02:22:49.885
So it's not just those images, right, or those performances, whether it's the clap, whether it's the Vidhin banner, whether it is the music, but it's also maybe the ideals, the values, the...

02:22:50.287 --> 02:22:58.456
you know, so justice for workers, for the peasants, for the Indians, really.

02:22:59.217 --> 02:23:14.693
You know, land, identity, this whole kind of like transformation that happens, you know, what Vasconcelos does is he takes that, right, and he transforms it.

02:23:14.713 --> 02:23:17.256
He transforms that idea of

02:23:17.692 --> 02:23:21.998
hey, mestizaje is actually, that's something we can be proud of, right?

02:23:22.398 --> 02:23:33.332
Because prior to that, you know, we were talking about the scientific racism, you know, and you have the U.S., you have Europe saying, oh, anybody who's mixed is inferior, right?

02:23:33.352 --> 02:23:33.993
Yeah, yeah.

02:23:34.013 --> 02:23:46.770
And so Vasconcelos basically is saying, now we're going to twist that around and we're going to talk about how this mix, these people who are mixed, the Mexican, right,

02:23:47.341 --> 02:23:58.112
is actually the race that's going to progress the... Well, I think what he was doing was he was actually reaching out from a European base.

02:23:58.132 --> 02:23:58.312
Yes.

02:23:58.332 --> 02:24:00.174
The Ulysses Criollo part of him.

02:24:00.194 --> 02:24:01.455
Yes.

02:24:01.475 --> 02:24:04.919
To incorporate the indígena, which had not been done in Mexico yet.

02:24:04.939 --> 02:24:05.119
Right.

02:24:05.359 --> 02:24:06.901
The idea, okay, this is part of me.

02:24:06.981 --> 02:24:09.243
This makes me a la raza cosmica.

02:24:09.644 --> 02:24:10.945
I can absorb this, you know.

02:24:11.205 --> 02:24:13.748
This cultural and racial fusion is what he's talking about.

02:24:13.808 --> 02:24:13.888
Yes.

02:24:14.206 --> 02:24:16.649
And that was a new idea.

02:24:16.669 --> 02:24:16.849
Okay.

02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:21.856
So openly, so publicly in the name of the government to be pushed that.

02:24:22.777 --> 02:24:42.643
And it has led, I think, to the contemporary concept the Mexicans have themselves, you know, they haven't completely embraced the indígena yet though, you know, if they, if they, if they would, I think that Mexico would be in a much better place if they took these indígena concepts seriously, you know, but they're still ignorant of it.

02:24:42.742 --> 02:24:52.113
Do you think that's the same for like Chicanos or Mexicanos, Latinos in the U.S.?

02:24:52.133 --> 02:24:55.057
I think that you can, yeah, it's all right to integrate.

02:24:55.838 --> 02:24:56.939
It's all right to assimilate.

02:24:57.961 --> 02:25:00.744
But you got to hold on to what's yours.

02:25:00.904 --> 02:25:02.927
You know, don't lose that as you go along.

02:25:02.967 --> 02:25:03.908
Don't lose your beans.

02:25:03.948 --> 02:25:06.471
You know, don't lose your magic beans.

02:25:07.210 --> 02:25:10.274
I was like, did he say beans or beans?

02:25:10.294 --> 02:25:11.255
Beans, okay.

02:25:12.056 --> 02:25:16.281
No, it's like, you know, Jack and the Beanstalk, you're magic beans, you know, and this is your culture.

02:25:16.521 --> 02:25:23.730
And if you sacrifice that, you're sacrificing yourself and then you're, all right, you're disappearing to the mass and the mass is still there.

02:25:24.731 --> 02:25:25.472
No one lives forever.

02:25:26.092 --> 02:25:28.255
But at the same time, you have a contribution to make.

02:25:28.335 --> 02:25:34.322
And I realized also as an activist, as an arts activist, that we are contributing.

02:25:34.442 --> 02:25:36.745
We're not taking, we're bringing stuff.

02:25:37.737 --> 02:25:46.446
you know, from our heritage under the main stage, under the main stream and say, this has to be accepted because this is good stuff.

02:25:46.627 --> 02:25:48.929
You know, don't, don't, don't deny this.

02:25:49.390 --> 02:25:50.851
Don't deny us because of this.

02:25:51.132 --> 02:25:54.155
But I would say that every culture has something to give on that regard.

02:25:54.175 --> 02:25:55.136
Right.

02:25:55.156 --> 02:25:59.200
And, and that, that, and it comes through many, many different forms.

02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:02.204
It comes through the arts, music, dance.

02:26:03.005 --> 02:26:04.386
It comes through business.

02:26:04.973 --> 02:26:10.418
You know, I wish we had a better business sense, you know, I mean, we Mexicanos had a better business sense.

02:26:10.918 --> 02:26:18.205
Some people do, it varies from individual to individual, but generally speaking, the Chinese are better at business than we are.

02:26:19.005 --> 02:26:19.326
Okay.

02:26:20.006 --> 02:26:30.636
It is a reason why the Jews are real good at banking is because they were the money changers, you know, as prejudicial as that may sound, the fact is that it's history and that's culture.

02:26:30.656 --> 02:26:33.478
And not only that, they devoted themselves to

02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:58.605
they being the Jews devoted themselves to a certain kind of intellectual, um, intellectual exercise that they do with a Talmud, you know, it's, it's, they, they, it's question and response, you know, it is intellectual investigations that they do on their own in the name of God in the search that allows them really to be very intellectual.

02:26:58.726 --> 02:27:00.428
You know, they, they, their minds are,

02:27:00.728 --> 02:27:02.613
It's like any muscle.

02:27:02.693 --> 02:27:05.682
They have a lot of strong muscles, you know, they're able to exercise.

02:27:06.283 --> 02:27:10.234
So there's a lot of intellectual brilliance there as a result of that activity, which they have.

02:27:10.615 --> 02:27:13.523
They also wrote the book, you know, they wrote the Bible.

02:27:13.992 --> 02:27:15.313
They wrote it down.

02:27:16.515 --> 02:27:26.805
Every culture has had religious and spiritual ideas, but not every culture has taken the trouble to write it down, get a language going and write it down.

02:27:26.825 --> 02:27:28.507
The Mayas wrote it down.

02:27:28.527 --> 02:27:38.797
That's what I'm saying about our culture is that we have links that take us back and that we can then disseminate those ideas and incorporate them into the modern life, right?

02:27:38.817 --> 02:27:39.978
Because it was written down.

02:27:40.519 --> 02:27:43.982
But the fact is that every culture has something to bring.

02:27:43.962 --> 02:27:49.850
Every culture has the same brilliance that manifests in their own way.

02:27:50.230 --> 02:28:02.366
And this kind of interchange that we get between people, whether it's just casual intermixing or working together or marrying and having children, all of that feeds the mainstream.

02:28:02.446 --> 02:28:03.147
You know what I'm saying?

02:28:03.207 --> 02:28:04.889
It's really important.

02:28:04.909 --> 02:28:07.593
Do you ever read W.E.B.

02:28:07.613 --> 02:28:07.793
Du Bois?

02:28:08.093 --> 02:28:08.593
Yeah.

02:28:08.874 --> 02:28:09.454
Oh yeah.

02:28:09.514 --> 02:28:10.695
Like Du Bois.

02:28:10.835 --> 02:28:12.257
I forget if it's a book.

02:28:12.337 --> 02:28:13.778
I think he's got a book.

02:28:13.898 --> 02:28:15.519
It's called the gift of black folk.

02:28:15.659 --> 02:28:15.960
Yeah.

02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:16.520
Yeah.

02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:24.627
And then some of his earlier work though, he really kind of talks about, Hey, everybody, every race has a contribution.

02:28:24.647 --> 02:28:25.288
That's right.

02:28:25.308 --> 02:28:25.828
That's right.

02:28:26.148 --> 02:28:26.449
Yeah.

02:28:27.069 --> 02:28:29.772
No, they give to the world, to society.

02:28:29.792 --> 02:28:31.193
He was a wonderful ideologue.

02:28:31.213 --> 02:28:37.358
I mean, he had brilliant ideas, which he shared, you know, with people and, and

02:28:38.772 --> 02:28:46.980
And they're still current, they're still going and people have built on, on, on what he can, but then he had others before him too.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:51.624
There are people that came, you know, Frederick Douglass was an ideologue, you know?

02:28:52.005 --> 02:28:58.892
But the thing is that even people didn't write books like Harriet Tubman, you know, contributed to the consciousness.

02:28:59.973 --> 02:29:03.956
What is the consciousness, you know, of, of the people at large and where does it come from?

02:29:04.297 --> 02:29:04.577
And,

02:29:05.047 --> 02:29:12.135
Women in general have not been acknowledged, you know, for their intellectual brilliance and their contributions to culture.

02:29:12.155 --> 02:29:14.857
That's a, a big one that we're still working on.

02:29:15.138 --> 02:29:21.905
And just looking back at it now, I'm amazed how primitive things are in that regard still, you know, and in the world.

02:29:22.726 --> 02:29:30.514
And, and it's, it's an evil actually that there's so much oppression of women for being women.

02:29:30.534 --> 02:29:34.058
And, and I say that as a man and I'm ashamed, frankly, of, uh,

02:29:34.426 --> 02:29:35.968
what men have done.

02:29:36.148 --> 02:29:45.321
I, I, uh, and, and, and I'm hoping that it will see changes, you know, as we go, they're inevitable.

02:29:45.341 --> 02:29:45.441
Yeah.

02:29:45.461 --> 02:29:55.536
But as we go along here, uh, uh, I do think that, uh, people just have to get smart about it and to get wise, you know, as to what's happening.

02:29:57.178 --> 02:29:57.278
Yeah.

02:29:57.298 --> 02:30:00.683
Um, well, I think that's, that's really kind of all I have.

02:30:00.723 --> 02:30:01.564
Um,

02:30:02.557 --> 02:30:15.551
I think a lot of the questions that I usually ask in this section kind of covered a lot of, is there anything that you want to add before we shut this off?

02:30:15.571 --> 02:30:22.338
Well, you know, we talk about the Chicano movement and people wonder, okay, where does it all come from and what is the meaning of it?

02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:31.888
And I read someone recently that there's this little village in Northern Mexico called Chicana.

02:30:33.421 --> 02:30:35.444
And that's just the name of the town, Chicana.

02:30:36.125 --> 02:30:37.888
And the people that came from there are Chicanos.

02:30:39.070 --> 02:30:40.412
And it's so close to the U.S.

02:30:40.432 --> 02:30:48.084
border that a lot of the early immigrants that arrived in California, especially in Texas, were Chicanos that came from Chicana.

02:30:49.306 --> 02:30:54.855
And so that may be one of the roots, you know, for the Chicano movement in that sense, that it came from a specific place.

02:30:55.493 --> 02:30:59.241
But what it really relates to is the whole process of immigration and crossing the border.

02:31:00.283 --> 02:31:06.014
And these days we're all into borders and immigration and it's just one more manifestation of the same shit.

02:31:06.034 --> 02:31:07.057
You know, it's always been there.

02:31:07.097 --> 02:31:16.135
People trying to accept somebody else and setting up boundaries and walls and trying to separate, you know, or exclude.

02:31:17.077 --> 02:31:19.040
It happened within the Chicano movement itself.

02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:24.888
You know, there was a tendency to become more Chicano than thou in some campuses and they form cliques.

02:31:25.489 --> 02:31:29.855
It just seems to be a human trait that needs to be dealt with on some level.

02:31:29.875 --> 02:31:30.877
It happens in religion.

02:31:31.738 --> 02:31:32.900
It happens in politics.

02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:37.787
We're seeing this whole Democrat versus Republican thing, which has gotten ridiculous.

02:31:37.947 --> 02:31:39.850
It's gotten absolutely ridiculous now.

02:31:39.890 --> 02:31:43.415
This tribal shit, you know, as if we're playing football or something.

02:31:43.435 --> 02:31:44.256
It's not football.

02:31:45.217 --> 02:31:45.818
And, um,

02:31:47.468 --> 02:31:59.061
But the fact is that, that in time, everything changes the river of time and the river of ideas and the river of history and culture, uh, takes all things with it.

02:31:59.081 --> 02:32:01.744
You know, it transforms everything.

02:32:01.764 --> 02:32:04.767
And, uh, that's how the grand Canyon was built.

02:32:04.787 --> 02:32:05.348
You know what I mean?

02:32:05.368 --> 02:32:14.217
So we have this grand Canyon that we're working on, you know, of human history and the river keeps flowing and it will continue to flow.

02:32:14.237 --> 02:32:14.978
Uh, if we're lucky.

02:32:15.413 --> 02:32:17.075
into the foreseeable future.

02:32:17.136 --> 02:32:40.971
But, um, the fact is that we need more understanding of each other and, and the way that we relocate ourselves into a place that is more is by opening up the stoppers, not by closing them up, by understanding how our particular relative position at this place at the point in time is just that it's a point in, in motion.

02:32:41.853 --> 02:32:42.754
And that, uh,

02:32:43.578 --> 02:32:47.101
Who knows a hundred years from now what the term Chicano will mean.

02:32:48.443 --> 02:32:52.026
And I'm pretty sure Mexico will still be there a hundred years from now.

02:32:52.046 --> 02:32:54.368
There's no reason why you can't imagine that.

02:32:54.388 --> 02:32:55.930
And the United States will be where it is.

02:32:56.810 --> 02:32:58.772
What will happen with that wall is something else.

02:33:00.694 --> 02:33:04.578
They'll find a good use for it.

02:33:04.598 --> 02:33:05.639
They'll find a good use for it.

02:33:06.399 --> 02:33:08.762
They in the future will find a good use for it.

02:33:08.782 --> 02:33:12.505
But at this point, it's silly.

02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:17.485
it really is ridiculous that impulse to try to build that wall.

02:33:17.545 --> 02:33:24.973
It's just, uh, instead of looking at what really the problem is and was, you know, it's our interconnectedness.

02:33:25.654 --> 02:33:27.296
That's the problem.

02:33:27.316 --> 02:33:31.361
And that if there's poverty in Mexico, uh, it's going to affect us here.

02:33:32.222 --> 02:33:39.150
And that, uh, and it's not all the fault of the Mexicans, you know, all those companies that go invest in Mexico and

02:33:39.839 --> 02:33:42.222
suck the light blood out of it, you know, are responsible.

02:33:42.903 --> 02:33:43.103
Yeah.

02:33:43.123 --> 02:33:49.011
For the desperation we've seen, not just in Mexico, in Central America, you know, Americans love their bananas too much.

02:33:50.352 --> 02:33:50.473
Yeah.

02:33:50.493 --> 02:33:50.593
Yeah.

02:33:50.613 --> 02:34:03.189
And I think, um, I mean, just to kind of speak to that, that a little bit, um, you know, I, I think it, it really is just a, it's a clashing of idea of ideologies, right?

02:34:03.209 --> 02:34:03.349
Mm-hmm.

02:34:03.667 --> 02:34:12.778
you have an ideology in the US, this kind of like white Eurocentric ideology that says, hey, we can control this.

02:34:13.238 --> 02:34:13.599
Yeah.

02:34:13.619 --> 02:34:13.899
Right?

02:34:13.979 --> 02:34:15.481
We can control the earth.

02:34:15.821 --> 02:34:16.062
Yeah.

02:34:16.082 --> 02:34:17.403
We can control people.

02:34:17.964 --> 02:34:18.985
Control women.

02:34:19.045 --> 02:34:20.947
And yeah, all of that, right?

02:34:20.967 --> 02:34:33.302
By setting up fences, by putting laws in place that criminalize people coming over, that set up, you know, the policies that are

02:34:33.603 --> 02:34:36.207
causing these people to want to come over right now.

02:34:36.447 --> 02:34:36.748
Right.

02:34:37.789 --> 02:34:44.560
And, and the thing is like, there's just a real lack of like these people, you know, we're talking about genetic memory.

02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:46.322
That's their genetic memory.

02:34:46.402 --> 02:34:48.666
We've been going back and forth, right.

02:34:48.766 --> 02:34:50.188
For thousands of years.

02:34:51.470 --> 02:35:02.547
Um, and I think it's just this, it's this clash between that kind of controlling Eurocentric type of philosophy or ideology.

02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:07.166
And this one that is just like, you can't do that.

02:35:08.108 --> 02:35:12.855
The earth and the universe will not let you do that, no matter how hard you try it.

02:35:12.995 --> 02:35:13.456
Exactly.

02:35:13.977 --> 02:35:15.779
Well, there's la raza cosmica, you know.

02:35:15.799 --> 02:35:18.984
That's where it becomes universal in relation to the universe.

02:35:19.445 --> 02:35:21.108
Everything is spinning, you know.

02:35:21.248 --> 02:35:22.710
It's what I call the power of the mind zero.

02:35:22.730 --> 02:35:23.251
It's a spin.

02:35:23.892 --> 02:35:24.192
Anyway.

02:35:25.414 --> 02:35:25.735
All right.

02:35:25.755 --> 02:35:26.235
Another book.

02:35:26.716 --> 02:35:27.297
